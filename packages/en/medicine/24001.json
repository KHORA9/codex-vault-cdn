H.\r\nNAPHEYS' _Physical Life of Woman_, places it beyond question among the\r\nclassics of the English language. Convinced of its high literary as well\r\nas medical value, the present publishers have spared no pains or expense\r\nto place it before the public in the most attractive style.\r\n\r\nThe _text_ has been most carefully revised and rewritten by the eminent\r\nauthor himself; extensive additions of important matter the fruit of\r\nthree more years devoted to the study of the subject and the wants of\r\nreaders, have been incorporated. In type, paper and binding, the most\r\nappropriate materials have been selected. And, to satisfy the repeated\r\nrequests of purchasers, permission has been obtained from the author to\r\ninsert his portrait, engraved on steel by one of the most skilful London\r\nartists.\r\n\r\nWith these additions, the _Physical Life of Woman_ comes before the\r\npublic with all the novelty and freshness of a new book, and also with\r\nthe solid and substantial reputation for practical worth which its sales\r\nof nearly _fifty thousand_ copies a year for _three_ years guarantee to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe add a\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF THE BOOK.\r\n\r\nIt treats of woman in her three great positions in life, as the MAIDEN,\r\nthe WIFE, and the MOTHER.\r\n\r\nUnder the first of these is discussed the mysterious change she\r\nundergoes when ripening from the indifferent girl to the tender and\r\nsensitive virgin. The dangers she runs at this critical epoch are\r\ncarefully noted, and the rules to prevent and remedy them clearly set\r\nforth. The all-absorbing topic of _Love_, is next treated of in a pure\r\nand elevated style, but strictly from the physician's point of view, and\r\nmany salutary hints are given to direct the passion to noble ends and in\r\nproper channels, and to teach the youthful reader how to shun\r\nunfortunate unions.\r\n\r\nIn the part addressed to _Wives_ the health of the married couple is\r\nfirst considered as being essential to their happiness. Plainly, yet\r\ndelicately, the rules that should govern them are laid down; the absence\r\nof children and their excessive numbers are both mentioned, as requiring\r\nappropriate correction, and an unsparing hand is laid upon certain\r\nprevalent social vices. A full discussion of the important topic of the\r\ninheritance of physical and mental traits will be found, and two most\r\nthorough and practical chapters on Pregnancy and Confinement are added,\r\nmost invaluable to every young wife.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the _Mother_ are next set forth, in nursing her child, and\r\ntaking proper care of it, in training its budding powers, and also in\r\ngiving her own attention to it in some of the more common diseases to\r\nwhich children are subject.\r\n\r\nThe sections devoted to _Health in Marriage_ will be peculiarly welcome\r\nto many women suffering in health from they know not what exact cause,\r\nbut really from some of those inward or local weaknesses which are here\r\ndescribed. While to very many others who are approaching or about\r\npassing through the critical epoch of the _Change of Life_, the full and\r\nwell-considered views of the author in the part devoted to that period\r\nwill be read with benefit and gratitude.\r\n\r\nA carefully prepared Index and a copious list of authorities close the\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: In the Biographical Sketch section, an \"a\" with a\r\nmacron has been marked as [=a] in this file.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\nPHYSICAL LIFE OF WOMAN:\r\nADVICE TO THE\r\nMAIDEN, WIFE AND MOTHER.\r\n\r\nby\r\nGEORGE H.

G.\r\nBRINTON, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. All\r\nrights reserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn presenting a third edition of this work to the public, with the final\r\nchanges and improvements of the author, the publishers have felt it a\r\nduty to attach to it a brief sketch of his life, which drew to so early\r\nand lamented a termination. The whole has also been submitted to a\r\ncareful revision, in order that it might be brought down to the latest\r\nadvances in the department of science of which it treats, and also to\r\ninclude in it the final suggestions of the author.\r\n\r\nWhile Dr. Napheys evidently considered the second edition of the present\r\nwork as meeting closely the requirements of readers, and therefore left\r\nbehind him no notes which would alter the general plan, a number of\r\ncorrections and minor changes have been made in the text, various\r\nparagraphs have been materially modified, and the Appendix referring to\r\nauthorities more or less altered.\r\n\r\nThe continued popularity of the work has been shown, not only by the\r\nsteady demand for it, but by the efforts of various authors to write\r\nimitations of it, and various publishers to issue mutilated and\r\nimperfect editions. Against these the present publishers would warn\r\ninnocent purchasers. The present is the only edition containing the\r\nimportant additions and corrections made by the author during the latter\r\nyears of his life; and none other was authorized by him.\r\n\r\nIn its present form, _The Physical Life of Woman_ may justly claim to\r\ncount among the classics of American literature. Its popularity\r\nincreases with time, and none of the many similar works which have\r\nappeared have approached it in public estimation. It is believed that in\r\nthe present edition no important scientific fact bearing upon the\r\nsubject has been omitted, and the most recent developments of hygiene\r\nwill be found discussed.\r\n\r\n1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND STEREOTYPE EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree years have passed since the author of the present work ventured to\r\nlay it before the public, not without unusual anxiety as to the manner\r\nin which he had fulfilled a task he knew to be so fruitful of good\r\nresults if well done. Those years of trial are over, and they have\r\nbrought a recognition of his labors beyond his most sanguine dreams.\r\nNearly _one hundred and fifty thousand copies_ of the work have been\r\nsold in that period; it has been separately republished both in Canada\r\nand England; it has been honored by a translation into German; the\r\nimitations of it which have been written form almost a small library;\r\nand, more to the satisfaction of the author than all this, it has\r\nreceived the highest praise both at home and abroad, from both the\r\nmedical profession and the general learned world.\r\n\r\nThe present new stereotype edition contains the result of three more\r\nyears of study and experience, enlightened and aided by very many\r\nletters from readers, which served to point out wherein the previous\r\nedition fell short of their wants. The text has been carefully revised,\r\nand in large part wholly rewritten; nearly one hundred and fifty pages\r\nof selected new matter have been added; and the latest steps of medical\r\nscience in this direction have been followed.\r\n\r\nOf the parts which are quite new, and which from the inquiries of\r\nnumerous readers will add greatly to the value of the work, are the\r\nsections on the disturbances of the monthly function in girls, the care\r\nof the child, the management of diseases of children, the diseases\r\nincident to pregnancy, childbed, and nursing, etc.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in the present edition the author has aimed to omit nothing\r\nwhich can aid Woman in performing her full duty to herself and others,\r\nso far as that duty lies in the sphere of her Physical Life, whether she\r\nis called upon to act as Wife, Mother, Teacher, or Guide. His most\r\nardent desire continues to be that the work will be found a sure and\r\nsafe monitor amid the difficult duties of Maidenhood and Maternity.\r\n\r\nLONDON, ENGLAND, October, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems well to offer, at the outset, a few words explanatory of the\r\nnature and object of this book. The author feels that its aim is novel,\r\nis daring, and will perhaps subject him to criticism. He therefore make\r\nhis plea, _pro domo sua_, in advance.\r\n\r\nThe researches of scientific men within the last few years have brought\r\nto light very many facts relating to the physiology of woman, the\r\ndiseases to which she is subject, and the proper means to prevent those\r\ndiseases. Such information, if universally possessed, cannot but result\r\nin great benefit to the individual and the commonwealth. The difficulty\r\nis to express one's self clearly and popularly on topics never referred\r\nto in ordinary social intercourse. But as the physician is obliged daily\r\nto speak in plain yet decorous language of such matters, the author felt\r\nthat the difficulty was not unsurmountable.\r\n\r\nHe is aware that a respectable though diminishing class in the community\r\nmaintain that nothing which relates exclusively to either sex should\r\nbecome the subject of popular medical instruction. With every\r\ninclination to do this class justice, he feels sure that such an opinion\r\nis radically erroneous. Ignorance is no more the mother of purity than\r\nshe is of religion. The men and women who study and practise medicine\r\nare not the worse, but the better, for their knowledge of such matters.\r\nSo it would be with the community. Had every person a sound\r\nunderstanding of the relations of the sexes, one of the most fertile\r\nsources of crime would be removed.\r\n\r\nA brief appendix has been added, directed more especially to the\r\nprofessional reader, who may desire to consult some of the original\r\nauthorities upon whom the author has drawn. And here he would ask from\r\nhis fellow-members of the medical profession their countenance and\r\nassistance in his attempt to distribute sound information of this\r\ncharacter among the people. None but physicians can know what sad\r\nconsequences are constantly occurring from the want of it. * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF GEORGE HENRY NAPHEYS, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere man's life measured by his deeds, as the poet suggests, how brief\r\nwould be the long years of many an octogenarian, and how extended the\r\nshort span which has been allotted to not a few of the world's famous\r\nheroes!\r\n\r\nThis oft-repeated thought strikes us forcibly in considering the\r\nbiography of the subject of this sketch. Closing his life at an age when\r\nmost professional men are but beginning theirs, he had already studied\r\nbroadly, had traveled widely over two continents, had gained credit and\r\nfame by the sword and the pen, and had amassed a fund of erudition and\r\nexperience which the more lethargic lives of most men fail to approach\r\nafter twice his length of days. It is eminently appropriate that a\r\nrecord of his busy career should be attached to the works on which his\r\ncelebrity is chiefly bound, and in which he most conspicuously displays\r\nthat command of language and happy facility of imparting instruction\r\nfor which he was so remarkable.\r\n\r\nGEORGE HENRY NAPHEYS (pronounced N[=a]'feez, the [=a] as in _fate_) was\r\nborn in the city of Philadelphia, March 5th, 1842. His parents died\r\nwhile he was still at a tender age, and he was placed with some\r\nrelatives who resided in the city. From early years he was characterized\r\nby quick perceptions and a retentive memory. In the Philadelphia High\r\nSchool, from which he received the academic degree of Master of Arts, he\r\nwas considered the best scholar in his class, a marked distinction in\r\nview of the large numbers which attend that institution. Besides\r\nacquiring the usual studies of the High School, he gave considerable\r\ntime to phonography, in which he became so skilled that he could report\r\nany ordinary speaker with entire accuracy. This subsequently proved a\r\ngreat advantage to him in his medical career.\r\n\r\nAfter his graduation he repaired to Hartford, Conn., where he was\r\noffered and accepted the position of private secretary to a gentleman of\r\nprominence in the literary and religious world.\r\n\r\nThus he was engaged when the civil war broke out. With his natural\r\nwarmth of feeling and strong emotions, he entered the fray among the\r\nfirst, and went out as Lieutenant, and subsequently as Captain, Company\r\nF, 10th Connecticut State Volunteers. The regiment was enlisted for nine\r\nmonths, and was dispatched to Louisiana, General Banks then commanding\r\nthe Department. It participated in engagements near Baton Rouge and on\r\nthe Red River, in which Captain Napheys always acquitted himself with\r\nbravery and credit.\r\n\r\nAt the time the regiment was disbanded, an early preference for medical\r\nsubjects led him to devote a year to the preliminary studies of that\r\nprofession, but not waiting the full period required for a degree, he\r\nwas appointed assistant medical officer on the U. S. steamer Mingo, of\r\nthe South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. On her he passed a number of\r\nmonths, cruising off the coast of the Carolinas and Georgia, and\r\nascended the St. John river.\r\n\r\nThese active duties prevented him from receiving his degree of Doctor of\r\nMedicine until after the close of the war, when, in 1866, his diploma\r\nwas conferred upon him by the Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia,\r\none of the most renowned institutions of our country.\r\n\r\nAfter graduation, he opened an office in Philadelphia, and connected\r\nhimself with the clinics which are held at the College for the purpose\r\nof supplying medicine and medical advice to the poor gratuitously, as\r\nwell as for giving students an opportunity of witnessing various forms\r\nof disease. The practical experience he gained in this manner was\r\nconsiderable, and his natural ability soon recommended him to the\r\nauthorities of the institution, who appointed him Chief of Medical\r\nClinic of the College, a position he held for several years.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of this post was that it brought him into constant\r\ncommunion with many eminent medical men, and rendered him practically\r\nacquainted with their treatment of disease. His skill in phonography\r\nenabled him to take abundant notes of their lectures, and this led to\r\nhis early connection with the periodical literature of the profession.\r\nMost of the reports he drew up were published in the _Medical and\r\nSurgical Reporter_, a weekly journal, devoted to medical science,\r\npublished in Philadelphia. The series of reports commenced in April,\r\n1866, and continued, with slight interruptions, until June, 1870. They\r\nare characterized by a clear and correct style, and a manifestly\r\nthorough grasp of the numerous topics treated.\r\n\r\nThe success which these ephemeral writings obtained turned his thoughts\r\nin the direction of authorship. His tastes and associations led him to\r\nemploy his powers in two directions: first, in preparing for the general\r\npublic a series of works which would acquaint them with anatomy,\r\nphysiology, hygiene, sanitary science, nursing, and the management of\r\ndisease, to the extent that intelligent general readers can and ought to\r\nknow about these subjects; and secondly, in writing for professional men\r\nseveral treatises on the means of alleviating and curing diseases.\r\n\r\nIn the prosecution of the first mentioned of these plans, he was early\r\nimpressed with the utter absence of any treatise on the hygiene of the\r\nsexual life in either sex, written in the proper spirit by a scientific\r\nman. The field had been left to quacks or worse, who, to serve their\r\nown base ends, scattered inflammatory and often indecent pamphlets over\r\nthe land; or else, had one or more of the points been handled by\r\nreputable writers, it was in such a vague and imperfect manner that the\r\nreader gained little benefit from the perusal. While all agreed that a\r\nsound treatise on these topics was most desirable, it had been openly\r\naverred that it could not be written in a proper style for the general\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nStrong in the conviction that pure motives, literary tact, and the\r\nrequisite scientific knowledge qualified him to undertake this difficult\r\ntask, Dr. Napheys prepared, in the early months of 1869, his work on\r\n\"The Physical Life of Woman.\" Proceeding with caution, he first\r\nsubmitted the MSS. to some professional friends, and profited by their\r\nsuggestions. After the work was in type, and before publication, he sent\r\ncomplete copies to a number of gentlemen, eminent as medical teachers,\r\nclergymen, educators, and literateurs. Their replies left him in no\r\ndoubt but that he had succeeded even beyond his anticipations. Almost\r\nunanimously the opinions were complimentary in the highest degree, and\r\nevidently written after a close examination of the book. As many of\r\nthese have been printed to accompany the work, in the last and previous\r\neditions, it is needless to do more in this connection than to say that\r\nthey were penned by such judges as Dr. W. A. Hammond, late\r\nSurgeon-General U. S. Army; Dr. Harvey L. Byrd, Professor in the Medical\r\nDepartment of Washington University, Md.; Dr. Edwin M. Snow, Health\r\nOfficer of the City of Providence, R. I.; Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, Rev.\r\nHorace Bushnell, D.D., Rev. George A. Crooke, D.D., D.C.L., and others.\r\n\r\nOn its appearance, the work was received with enthusiasm by both the\r\nmedical press and the public. While a few journals and individuals were\r\ninclined to condemn it and censure the author, the intelligent and the\r\npure-minded, on all sides, recognized in him the only writer who had yet\r\nappeared able to treat these delicate subjects with the dignity of\r\nscience and the straightforwardness necessary for popular instruction.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that he had chosen the proper exercise for his talents, he\r\ncomposed and placed in the hands of his publisher, the following year,\r\nhis not less extraordinary work, \"The Transmission of Life,\" a treatise\r\naddressed to the male, as his previous one had been to the female sex.\r\nIt was dedicated to the late Rev. John Todd, so well known for his\r\ninterest in young men, and his \"Student's Manual\" and other works\r\naddressed to them. He accepted the dedication and addressed the author a\r\nletter, in which occurs the following high compliment to his work: \"I am\r\nsurprised at the extent and accuracy of your reading; the judiciousness\r\nof your positions and results; the clear, unequivocal, yet delicate and\r\nappropriate language used; and the amount of valuable information\r\nconveyed.\" Similar expressions poured in from many other distinguished\r\ncritics, as, for instance, Dr. Noah Porter, President of Yale College;\r\nthe Rev. Henry Clay Trumbull, the Rev. Abner Jackson, President of\r\nTrinity College, Hartford, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the same year (1870) he brought out the first edition of his \"Modern\r\nTherapeutics,\" a technical work, addressed to physicians. This was\r\nenlarged in successive editions, until in its present form, as continued\r\nby other hands in its latest editions, it comprises two parts of 600\r\npages each. Although the author claimed little other originality in this\r\nwork than the selection and arrangement of known facts, yet in these\r\nrespects he displayed the strongly practical and original turn of his\r\nmind. As a student of the art of Therapeutics in large hospitals,\r\nclinics, and dispensaries, he had convinced himself that it is not by\r\nexperiments on lower animals, nor yet on the human body in health, that\r\nthe physician can attain the glorious power of alleviating pain and\r\ncuring disease; it is only through the daily combat with sickness, by\r\nthe bedside and in the consulting room. Chemistry and physiology, he\r\nbelieved, could teach but little in this branch; observation and\r\nexperience everything. Hence, in his work on Therapeutics he announced\r\nhimself as \"aiming at a systematic analysis of all current and approved\r\nmeans of combating disease,\" selecting his formulæ and therapeutical\r\ndirections from the most eminent living physicians of all nations.\r\n\r\nThis work was most favorably received by medical men; and, edited and\r\nrevised by competent hands, continues to be regarded as one of the most\r\nvaluable works in American medical literature. The unanimous opinion of\r\nthe leading medical journals, as well as of its numerous purchasers,\r\nhave testified to its real and great worth to the practitioner of\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nHaving thus established a wide, popular and professional reputation, one\r\nwhich would have guaranteed him a lucrative practice, it would have\r\ntempted another, no doubt, to make the most of this opportunity, so\r\nrarely granted a young physician. Not so was it with Dr. Napheys. No\r\nsooner had the three works mentioned been completed than he sailed for\r\nEurope, in order to familiarize himself with the famed schools of\r\nlearning of the Old World and its rich stores of material for culture.\r\nThe summer was that of the Franco-German war; and spending most of it in\r\nParis, he was witness of several of the most exciting scenes which\r\nattended the dethronement of the Emperor. These he would describe\r\nafterwards with a vividness and power of language rarely excelled.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of the period did not, however, withdraw his attention\r\nfrom the studies he had in view. These were partially indicated in a\r\nseries of letters he contributed to various periodicals during his\r\nabsence. While these letters were principally of a scientific character,\r\nit is noteworthy how the relations of medicine to the welfare of man\r\nalways occupied his attention. Thus we find, in one sent from England,\r\nJune, 1870, a description of the Liverpool Medical Missionary Society,\r\na charity which combines religious instruction with medical advice; and\r\nagain, he comments on the popular instruction in hygiene which was\r\nsupplied at that period to the English workingmen by a committee of\r\ncompetent physicians, organized for that purpose. It was the author's\r\npurpose to collect and expand these letters into a volume, but the\r\nproject was not carried out.\r\n\r\nThe siege of Paris, which city he left in one of the last trains before\r\nthe blockade commenced, and the prolongation of the war, induced him to\r\nreturn home. In the United States he found offers from several\r\npublishers awaiting him, which would more than occupy him for a full\r\nyear. There was a new edition of his \"Therapeutics\" demanded, and a\r\nrevision of both \"The Physical Life of Woman\" and \"The Transmission of\r\nLife.\" A New England firm urgently pressed him to superintend the\r\nproduction of several hygienic works, and secured him as literary\r\nadviser to their house. He assumed the editorship of the \"Half-Yearly\r\nCompendium of Medical Science,\" and also of a \"Physician's Annual,\"\r\nbesides undertaking a number of articles for the periodical press, both\r\nscientific and popular.\r\n\r\nTo this active literary life he devoted the year 1871; but at its close\r\nfelt more strongly than ever that he must give himself several years of\r\nstudious quiet, in order to accomplish his best. Refusing, therefore,\r\nany further engagements, he sailed for Europe again, late in 1871, and\r\ndid not return this time until the spring of 1875. In this period, of\r\nmore than three years, he visited almost all the principal cities of\r\nEurope, and enjoyed the friendship of many eminent men at London, St.\r\nPetersburg, Vienna, and Paris. Reading, visiting hospitals, and\r\nattending clinics, he accumulated a mass of material which he designed\r\nto work up into future literary enterprises.\r\n\r\nWith these collected stores he returned to the United States early in\r\n1875, and set to work with his wonted energy. A new and much enlarged\r\nedition of the \"Therapeutics\" was sent to press; a \"Handbook of Popular\r\nMedicine,\" designed to give, in simple language, the domestic treatment\r\nof disease, the rules for nursing the sick, selected receipts for diet\r\nand medicinal purposes, and the outlines of anatomy and physiology, was\r\nput in the hands of a publisher; a Synopsis of Pharmacy and Materia\r\nMedica, a work of enormous labor, was well under way; and other literary\r\nprojects were actively planned; when, suddenly, the summons came which,\r\nin an instant, with the shears of fate, slit the strand of this\r\nactivity. The rest of the story may be told in the words of the\r\nbiographer appointed by the Medical Society of the County of\r\nPhiladelphia to prepare a memoir of his life:--\r\n\r\n\"While earnestly laboring to prepare for the press his literary\r\ncollections, he suffered a severe blow by the sudden death of a person\r\nto whom he was deeply attached. Over-work and this emotional shock\r\nproduced a result likely enough to occur in one of his ardent\r\ntemperament. One afternoon, while engaged in writing, he fell,\r\nunconscious, from his chair, and for several days lay in a very critical\r\ncondition. On recovering his powers, it was evident his brain had\r\nsuffered a serious lesion. The old energy and love of labor had\r\ncompletely gone; even the capacity for work seemed absent. Marked\r\nmelancholy followed, characterized before long by avoidance of friends\r\nand the loss of a desire of life. This occurred with increasing force\r\nuntil it led to his death, on July 1, 1876, through some toxic agent,\r\nthe nature of which was not ascertained.\r\n\r\n\"Thus early, and thus sadly, terminated a career of unusual brilliancy\r\nand promise.\r\n\r\n\"It is probable that much that he has written will be read with pleasure\r\nand instruction by future generations; and the memory of his genial\r\ndisposition, his entertaining conversation, and earnest sense of\r\nprofessional honor, will long be cherished by those of his\r\ncontemporaries who enjoyed his friendship.\"--_Transactions of the\r\nMedical Society of the State of Pennsylvania_, vol. xi, p. 720.\r\n\r\nVarious tributes were paid to his memory by the societies with which he\r\nwas connected, and by the scientific journals to which he had been a\r\ncontributor. One of these, after narrating some of the circumstances\r\nattending his decease, spoke as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Thus did our unfortunate associate close his short but brilliant\r\ncareer. The emotions, the tender sentiments he has described with such a\r\nmagical pen, he felt himself with an unmatched keenness. They mastered\r\nhis whole frame with an intensity surpassing all romance. His\r\ndescriptions of the passions, descriptions which have been the wonder of\r\nthousands, such is their fire and temper, were not rhetorical studies,\r\nbut the ebullition of a soul sensitive to their lightest breath, and not\r\nshunning their wildest tempests.\r\n\r\n\"The genius which dictated the lines he has left us is not to be judged\r\nby the conventionalities which suit the cold temperaments of ordinary\r\nmen; there is a strong vein of egotism in most devotion; but here was\r\none who felt, 'all is lost, when love is lost.'\"\r\n\r\nThis extract well sets forth the extraordinary depth of his sentiments,\r\nand the fervor of his feelings. It may be added that these mental traits\r\nwere not generally ascribed to him by casual or ordinary associates. He\r\nwas, in manners and bearing, evidently not one who sought friendships or\r\ndisplayed to the general gaze the current of his thoughts. Consequently,\r\nof intimates he had but few, and was considered by those whose\r\nintercourse with him was superficial, to be much more of an intellectual\r\nthan of an emotional type of character.\r\n\r\nThis impression was doubtless increased by the strongly practical turn\r\nof his mind, which is conspicuous in all his works. He was the reverse\r\nof a dreamer and had little patience with theorists. In his professional\r\nstudy he always aimed at bringing into the strongest light the\r\nutilitarian aspect of medicine, its ameliorating power on humanity, its\r\nreal efficacy in preserving or restoring health and limiting human\r\nmisery. On this his theory of therapeutics was based, and, inspired by\r\nthe same opinions, he was one of the most earnest advocates of the day\r\nof popularizing medical science in all its branches among the masses. In\r\nthis effort he was at times severely criticized by that class of\r\nphysicians--and they are by no means extinct--who think that medicine\r\nshould be wrapped in mystery, and that the people should be kept in\r\nignorance of themselves and of their own physical frailties, to the\r\nutmost possible extent. With these learned obscurantists Dr. Napheys had\r\nno patience, and naturally found but slight favor. Fortunately, they\r\nwere in the decided minority, and, we are happy to add, even that\r\nminority is daily decreasing.\r\n\r\nOf the various learned societies to which he was attached may be\r\nmentioned the Philadelphia County Medical Society, the Franklin\r\nInstitute of Philadelphia, and the Gynecological Society of Boston. His\r\nelection as Corresponding Member to the latter body (which is an\r\nassociation of scientific men who make an especial study of the hygiene\r\nand diseases of women) took place shortly after the first publication of\r\nthe _Physical Life of Woman_, and was meant as a direct tribute of\r\nrespect to him as the author of that work, thus obtaining for it the\r\ntestimony of the highest body in that specialty then existing in our\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe general plan on which Dr. Napheys prepared his sanitary writings was\r\none eminently calculated to reconcile those who were most opposed to\r\ninstructing the general public in such branches. While he confidently\r\nbelieved that vastly more harm than good is done by a prudish\r\nconcealment of the physiology of sex and its relations to health, he\r\nalso clearly recognized that such instruction should be imparted at the\r\nproper age and under certain limitations; while the general facts common\r\nto the species cannot be taught too generally, or made too familiar.\r\nHence, he projected three books, one to be placed in the hands of young\r\nwomen, a second for youths, and a third for a general household book of\r\nreading and reference on medicine and hygiene. These three he completed\r\nin \"The Physical Life of Woman,\" \"The Transmission of Life,\" and the\r\n\"Handbook of Popular Medicine.\"\r\n\r\nThis plan, he believed, met all the objections to popular medical\r\ninstruction, at least all well-grounded objections, while at the same\r\ntime it did away with any necessity for concealing truths important to\r\nbe known, for fear they should come to the knowledge of those for whom\r\nthey were not designed, and on whose minds they might have a disturbing\r\ntendency.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt but that both the plan and its execution were\r\nsuccessful. The many letters he received, filled with thanks from\r\nprivate parties who had gained inestimable knowledge from these works,\r\nmade rich compensation for the occasional severe strictures he received\r\nfrom those wedded to ancient ways, and who often condemned without even\r\nreading his works.\r\n\r\nThe intelligent reading public, on whom, after all, the writer must\r\ndepend for a verdict on his works, were unanimous in his favor. They\r\nbought them in quantities, and the writer of his life in the\r\n_Transactions of the Pennsylvania State Medical Society_, above quoted,\r\nwho wrote in 1877, estimates that by that time over _a quarter of a\r\nmillion_ copies had been printed and sold. Translations were made into\r\nthe German, and several editions pirated and printed in Canada and\r\nEngland. In fact, the works may now be considered to rank as classics in\r\nthe language, and many years must go by before another such series can\r\nbe written, on topics of this nature, with equal delicacy of touch and\r\naccuracy of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n                                                                      PAGE\r\n\r\n    Knowledge is safety--The peculiarities of sex--Examples of\r\n    individuals belonging to both sexes and to neither sex--The\r\n    sphere of woman                                                  15-22\r\n\r\n\r\nPart I.

The maxim is true; but here\r\nis a greater truth: 'Knowledge is safety,'--safety amid the physical\r\nills that beset us,--safety amid the moral pitfalls that environ us.\r\n\r\nFilled with this thought, we write this book. It is the Revelation of\r\nScience to Woman. It tells her, in language which aims at nothing but\r\nsimplicity, the results which the study of her nature, as distinct from\r\nthat of man, has attained. We may call it her physical biography.\r\n\r\nIt is high time that such a book were written. The most absorbing\r\nquestion of the day is the 'Woman Question.' The social problems of\r\nchiefest interest concern her. And nowhere are those problems more\r\nzealously studied than in America, which has thrown aside the trammels\r\nof tradition, and is training its free muscles with intent to grapple\r\nthe untried possibilities of social life. Who can guide us in these\r\nexperiments? What master, speaking as one having authority, can advise\r\nus? There is such a guide, such a master. The laws of woman's physical\r\nlife shape her destiny and reveal her future. Within these laws all\r\nthings are possible; beyond them, nothing is of avail.\r\n\r\nEspecially should woman herself understand her own nature. How many\r\nwomen are there, with health, beauty, merriment, ay, morality too, all\r\ngone, lost for ever, through ignorance of themselves! What spurious\r\ndelicacy is this which would hide from woman that which beyond all else\r\nit behooves her to know? We repudiate it; and in plain, but decorous\r\nlanguage,--truth is always decorous,--we purpose to divulge those\r\nsecrets hidden hitherto under the technical jargon of science.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISTINCTION OF THE SEXES.\r\n\r\nThe distinction of the sexes belongs neither to the highest nor to the\r\nlowest forms of existence. Animals and vegetables of the humblest\r\ncharacter have no sex. So it is with spirits. Revelation implies that\r\nbeyond this life sexual characteristics cease. On one occasion the\r\nSadducees put this question to Christ: There was a woman who lawfully\r\nhad seven husbands, one after the other; now, at the resurrection, which\r\nof these shall be her husband? or shall they all have her to wife? He\r\nreplied that hereafter there shall be neither marrying nor giving in\r\nmarriage, but that all shall be 'as the angels which are in heaven.'\r\nSexuality implies reproduction, and that is something we do not\r\nassociate with spiritual life.\r\n\r\nIt further implies imperfection, which is equally far from our hopes of\r\nhappiness beyond the grave. The polyp, which reproduces by a division of\r\nitself, is in one sense more complete than we are. The man is in some\r\nrespects inferior to the woman; the woman in others is subordinate to\r\nman. A happy marriage, a perfect union, they twain one flesh, is the\r\ntype of the independent, completed being. Without the other, either is\r\ndefective. 'Marriage,' said Napoléon, 'is strictly indispensable to\r\nhappiness.'\r\n\r\nThere is, in fact, a less difference between the sexes than is generally\r\nbelieved. They are but slight variations from one original plan.\r\nAnatomists maintain, with plausible arguments, that there is no part or\r\norgan in the one sex but has an analogous part or organ in the other,\r\nsimilar in structure, similar in position. Just as the right side\r\nresembles the left, so does man resemble woman.\r\n\r\nLet us see what differences there really are:\r\n\r\nThe frame of woman is shorter and slighter. In the United States the men\r\naverage five feet eight inches in height, and one hundred and forty-five\r\npounds in weight; the women, five feet two and a half inches in height,\r\nand one hundred and twenty-five pounds in weight. Man has broad\r\nshoulders and narrow hips; woman has narrow shoulders and broad hips.\r\nHer skull is formed of thinner bones, and is in shape more like that of\r\na child. Its capacity, in proportion to her height, is very little less\r\nthan in man,--about one-fiftieth, it is said,--which, so far as\r\nbrain-power is concerned, may readily be made up by its finer texture.\r\nHer shoulders are set farther back than in the other sex, giving her\r\ngreater breadth of chest in front. This is brought about by the\r\nincreased length of her collar-bone; and this is the reason why she can\r\nnever throw a ball or stone with the accuracy of a man. Graceful in\r\nother exercises, here she is awkward.\r\n\r\nHer contour is more rounded, her neck is longer, her skin smoother, her\r\nvoice softer, her hair less generally distributed over the body, but\r\nstronger in growth than in man. She breathes with the muscles of her\r\nchest--he with those of his abdomen. He has greater muscular force--she\r\nmore power of endurance. Beyond all else she has the attributes of\r\nmaternity,--she is provided with organs to nourish and protect the child\r\nbefore and after birth.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONS OF BOTH SEXES AND OF NEITHER SEX.\r\n\r\nNature is very sedulous in maintaining these differences. It is the\r\nrarest thing in the world to find a human being of doubtful sex. Many a\r\nphysician disbelieves that there ever has been a person of both sexes--a\r\ntrue hermaphrodite. They are very scarce, but they do exist. There is\r\none now living in Germany. It bears a female name, Catherine Hohmann.\r\nShe was baptised and brought up a female; but Catherine is as much man\r\nas woman. The learned professor of anatomy, Rokitansky, of Vienna,\r\nasserts most positively that this is a real hermaphrodite. Her history\r\nis sad. Born in humble circumstances, when of marriageable age she loved\r\na man, who wished her to emigrate with him to America. But when she\r\ndisclosed to him her deformity, he broke off the engagement and deserted\r\nher. Then her affection became fixed on a young girl; but how could she\r\nmake her suit to one apparently of her own sex? With passions that\r\nprompt her to seek both sexes, she belongs to neither. 'What shall I do\r\nhere on earth?' she exclaimed, in tears, to a man of science who\r\nrecently visited her. 'What am I? In my life an object of scientific\r\nexperiment, and after my death an anatomical curiosity.'\r\n\r\nThere are also persons--very few indeed--who have no sex at all. They\r\nare without organs and without passions. Such creatures seem to have\r\nbeen formed merely to show us that this much-talked-of difference of sex\r\nis, after all, nothing inherent in the constitution of things, and that\r\nindividuals may be born, live and thrive, of both sexes, or of neither.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPHERE OF WOMAN.\r\n\r\nOur province lies within the physical sphere of woman. But we will here\r\nallow ourselves a momentary digression. It will be seen that while these\r\ndifferences are not radical, yet they are peculiarly permanent. They\r\nhint to us the mental and intellectual character of woman. What opinion\r\nshould we hold on this much-vexed question?\r\n\r\nTo this effect: The mental faculties of man and woman are unlike, but\r\nnot unequal. Any argument to the contrary, drawn from the somewhat less\r\nweight of the brain of woman, is met by the fact that the most able men\r\nare often undersized, with small heads. The subordinate place which\r\nwoman occupies in most states, arises partly from the fact that the part\r\nshe plays in reproduction prevents her from devoting her whole time and\r\nenergies to the acquisition of power, and partly from the fact that\r\nthose faculties in which she is superior to man have been obscured and\r\noppressed by the animal vigor and selfishness of the male. As\r\ncivilisation advances, the natural rights of woman will be more and more\r\nfreely conceded, until the sexes become absolutely equal before the law;\r\nand, finally, her superiority in many respects will be granted, and she\r\nwill reap the benefits of all the advantages it brings, without desiring\r\nto encroach on those avocations for which masculine energy and strength\r\nare imperatively needed.\r\n\r\nThe most peculiar features of woman's life are hers for a limited period\r\nonly. Man is man for a longer time than woman is woman. With him it is a\r\nlifetime matter; with her it is but for a score of years or so. Her\r\nchild-bearing period is less than half her life. Within this time she\r\npasses through all the phases of that experience which is peculiarly her\r\nown.\r\n\r\nAnd these phases, what are they? Nature herself defines them. They are\r\nthree in number,--the Maiden, the Wife, and the Mother. In one and then\r\nanother of this triad, her life passes. Each has its own duties and\r\ndangers; each demands its own precautions; each must be studied by\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nLet us at once commence this important study, and proceed in the order\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAIDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PUBERTY._\r\n\r\nAt a certain period in the life of the female, she ceases to be a girl,\r\nand becomes a _woman_. Hitherto she has felt no distinction between\r\nherself and the boys, her playmates. But now a crisis takes place, which\r\nis for ever after to hedge her round with a mysterious, invisible, but\r\nmost real barrier from all _man_kind.\r\n\r\nThis period is called _the age of puberty_. Its sign is a flow of blood\r\nrecurring every month; its meaning, that the female has entered upon\r\nthat portion of her life whose peculiar obligations are to the whole\r\nrace--no longer to herself alone. The second part of her twofold nature\r\nis opened. Why is it that on her, the weaker sex, this extra burden is\r\nlaid? Why this weakness, these pains, this recurring loss of vital\r\nfluid?\r\n\r\nPerhaps, as has been observed, it is a wise provision that she is thus\r\nreminded of her lowly duty, lest man should make her the sole object of\r\nhis worship, or lest the pride of beauty should obscure the sense of\r\nshame. But this question concerns rather the moralist than the\r\nphysician, and we cease asking _why_ it is, and shall only inquire\r\n_what_ it is.\r\n\r\nTo this science returns a clear reply. In the anatomy of woman there are\r\ntwo small bodies, in shape and size like large almonds, called the\r\novaries. They lie one on each side of the womb, and are connected with\r\nit by tubes about four inches in length. These bodies are solid, but\r\ncontain a great number of diminutive vesicles, which, by some mysterious\r\nlaw of nature, mature one at a time, every thirty days, for thirty years\r\nof woman's life. When mature, the vesicle separates from the ovary,\r\ntraverses the tube into the womb, and is thence expelled and lost, or\r\nbecomes, by contact with the other sex, the germ of a living being. This\r\nprocess is accompanied by a disturbance of the whole system. Wandering\r\npains are felt; a sense of languor steals over the mind; the blood\r\nrushes with increased violence through the vessels, and more or less of\r\nit escapes from the veins, causing that change which we term\r\n_menstruation._\r\n\r\nThe ancients had a tradition that in the beginning of things the world\r\nwas made from an egg; the naturalists of past generations had this\r\nmaxim: Everything living comes from an egg; and science to-day says the\r\nsame. For this vesicle we have mentioned is in fact an _egg_, similar in\r\nstructure to those which birds, fish, and turtles deposit. The only\r\ndifferences are, that the one is developed out of the body, the other\r\nwithin; the one has a shell, the other has none.\r\n\r\nTherefore physiologists give this definition: Menstruation is\r\novulation,--it is the laying of an egg.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE AGE OF PUBERTY?\r\n\r\nThis has been a matter of careful study by physicians. They have\r\ncollected great numbers of observations, and have reached this\r\nconclusion: In the middle portion of the temperate zone, the average age\r\nwhen the first period appears in healthy girls is fourteen years and six\r\nmonths. If it occurs more than six months later or earlier than this,\r\nthen it is likely something is wrong, or, at least, the case is\r\nexceptional.\r\n\r\nExceptional cases, where this average is widely departed from in\r\napparently perfect health, are rare. But they do occur. We have known\r\ninstances where the solicitude of parents has been excited by the long\r\ndelay of this constitutional change, and others in which it has taken\r\nplace at an almost tender age, without causing any perceptible injury to\r\nthe general health.\r\n\r\nThere is an instance recorded, on good authority, where a French child\r\nbut three years old underwent all the physical changes incident to\r\npuberty, and grew to be a healthy woman. But what children can surpass\r\nthe American in precocity? This French child-woman is quite left in the\r\nshade by one described in a recent number of a western medical journal,\r\nwho _from her birth_ had regular monthly changes, and the full physical\r\ndevelopment which marks the perfect woman!\r\n\r\nThus, sometimes, a wide deviation from the average age we have stated\r\noccurs, without having any serious meaning. Yet at no time is such a\r\ndeviation to be neglected. In nine out of ten instances it is owing to\r\nsome fault in the constitution, the health, or formation, which should\r\nbe ascertained and corrected. Otherwise years of broken health and\r\nmental misery may be the sad results. Mothers, teachers, it is with you\r\nthis responsibility rests. The thousands of wretched wives, who owe\r\ntheir wretchedness to a neglect of proper attention at this\r\nturning-point of their lives, warn you how serious is this\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of old age, says a distinguished author, is laid in\r\nchildhood; but the health of middle-life depends upon puberty. Never was\r\nthere a truer maxim. The two years which change the girl to the woman\r\noften seal for ever the happiness or the hopeless misery of her whole\r\nlife. They decide whether she is to become a healthy, helpful, cheerful\r\nwife and mother, or a languid, complaining invalid, to whom marriage is\r\na curse, children an affliction, and life itself a burden.\r\n\r\nWe reiterate our warning: Mothers, teachers, you to whom children are\r\nconfided at this crisis of their lives, look well to it that you\r\nappreciate, understand, and observe the duties you have assumed. Let no\r\nfalse modesty prevent you from learning and enforcing those precautions,\r\nso necessary at this period of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT HASTENS AND WHAT RETARDS PUBERTY?\r\n\r\nAs a rule, we find that those who develope early, fade early. A short\r\nchildhood portends a premature old age. It often foreshadows, also, a\r\nfeeble middle-life.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained, therefore, what is the average age at which puberty\r\ntakes place with us, let us see what conditions anticipate or retard\r\nthis age.\r\n\r\nThe most important is _climate._\r\n\r\nIn hot climates, man, like the vegetation, has a surprising rapidity of\r\ngrowth. Marriages are usual at twelve or fourteen years of age. Puberty\r\ncomes to both sexes as early as at ten and eleven years. We even read in\r\nthe life of Mohammed, that one of his wives, when but ten years of age,\r\nbore him a son. Let another dozen years pass, and these blooming maidens\r\nhave been metamorphosed into wrinkled, faded old women. The beauty of\r\ntheir precocious youth has withered almost literally like a flower which\r\nis plucked.\r\n\r\nVery different is it in the cold and barren regions of the far north.\r\nThere man, once more partaking of the nature of his surroundings, yields\r\nas slowly to the impulses of his passions as does the ice-bound earth to\r\nthe slanting rays of the summer sun. Maturity, so quick to come, so\r\nswift to leave in the torrid heats, arrives, chilled by the long\r\nwinters, to the girls of Lapland, Norway, and Siberia, only when they\r\nare eighteen and nineteen years of age. But, in return for this, they\r\nretain their vigor and good looks to a green old age.\r\n\r\nBetween these extremes, including as they do the whole second decade of\r\nexistence, this important change takes place normally in different\r\nlatitudes. We have said that in the middle temperate zone the proper age\r\nis fourteen years and six months. Let us now see what conditions lead to\r\ndeviations from this age in our climate.\r\n\r\nFirst on the list is that sacred fire handed down to us from our\r\nancestors, which we call, in our material language, the _constitution._\r\n\r\nThe females of certain races, certain families, it is often noticed,\r\nmature earlier than their neighbours. Jewesses, for example, are always\r\nprecocious, earlier by one or two years. So are colored girls, and those\r\nof creole lineage. We can guess the reasons here. No doubt these\r\nchildren still retain in their blood the tropic fire which, at\r\ncomparatively recent periods, their forefathers felt under the vertical\r\nrays of the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. It is well ascertained, from numerous observations,\r\nthat brunettes develope sooner than their blonde sisters; that those who\r\nwill grow to be large women are slower than those whose stature will be\r\nsmall; that the dark-haired and black-eyed are more precocious in this\r\nrespect than the light-haired and blue-eyed; that the fat, sluggish girl\r\nis more tardy than the slender, active one; that, in general, what is\r\nknown as the nervo-bilious temperament is ever ahead of that called the\r\nlymphatic or phlegmatic.\r\n\r\nIt is a familiar fact, that it is not a good sign to see this change\r\nbefore the usual average time. It betokens a weakly, excitable,\r\ndiminutive frame. Hard labor, vigorous, regular muscular exertion--prime\r\nhealth, in other words--never tends to anticipate this epoch, but rather\r\nto retard it.\r\n\r\nWith this warning fresh in our ears, let us now rehearse what causes\r\nconstantly incline unduly to hasten puberty, and thus to forestall wise\r\nNature in her plans for health and beauty. They are of two\r\nkinds,--physical and mental.\r\n\r\nIdleness of body, highly-seasoned food, stimulating beverages, such as\r\nbeer, wine, liqueurs, and, in a less degree, coffee and tea, irregular\r\nhabits of sleep,--these are the physical causes of premature\r\ndevelopment. But the mental causes are still more potent.\r\n\r\nWhatever _stimulates the emotions_ leads to an unnaturally early sexual\r\nlife. Late hours, children's parties, sensational novels, 'flashy'\r\npapers, love stories, the drama, the ball-room, talk of beaux, love, and\r\nmarriage,--that atmosphere of riper years which is so often and so\r\ninjudiciously thrown around childhood,--all hasten the event which\r\ntransforms the girl into the woman. A particular emphasis has been laid\r\nby some physicians on the power of music to awaken the dormant\r\nsusceptibilities to passion, and on this account its too general or\r\nearnest cultivation by children has been objected to. Educators would do\r\nwell to bear this caution in mind.\r\n\r\nHow powerfully these causes work is evident when we compare the average\r\nage of puberty in large cities and in country districts. The females in\r\nthe former mature from six to eight months sooner than those in the\r\nlatter. This is unquestionably owing to their mode of life,--physically\r\nindolent, mentally over-stimulated. The result, too, is seen with\r\npainful plainness in comparing the sturdy, well-preserved farm-wife of\r\nthirty, with the languid, pale, faded city lady of the same age.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGES IT WORKS.\r\n\r\nTwo short years change the awkward and angular girl of fourteen into the\r\ntrim and graceful maiden of sweet sixteen. Wonderful metamorphosis! The\r\nmagic wand of the fairy has touched her, and she comes forth a new\r\nbeing, a vision of beauty to bewitch the world.\r\n\r\nLet us analyze this change.\r\n\r\nThe earliest sign of approaching puberty is a deposit of fat in the\r\nloose cellular tissue under the skin. This gives roundness to the form,\r\nand grace to the movements. According to a distinguished naturalist\r\n(Buffon), it is first observable by a slight swelling of the groins.\r\nThence it extends over the whole body. The breasts especially receive\r\nadditions, and develope to form the perfect bust.\r\n\r\nParts of the body previously free from hair become covered with a soft\r\ngrowth, and that which covers the head acquires more vigor and gloss,\r\nusually becoming one or two shades darker. The eyes brighten, and\r\nacquire unwonted significance. These windows of the soul betray to the\r\nclose observer the novel emotions which are arising in the mind within.\r\n\r\nThe voice, too, shares in the transformation. The piping, slender\r\narticulation of the child gives way to the rich, melodious, soft voice\r\nof woman--the sweetest music man ever hears. To the student of humanity,\r\nto the observant physician, nothing is more symbolical of the whole\r\nnature than the voice. Would you witness a proof of its power? Watch\r\nhow a person born blind unerringly discriminates the character of those\r\nhe meets by this alone.\r\n\r\nBeyond all external modifications, we find others, which indicate how\r\nprofound is the alteration now taking place. The internal organs of the\r\nbody assume new functions and new powers. The taste for food changes,\r\nhinting that the system has demands hitherto unknown. Those organs we\r\nhave adverted to, called the ovaries, increase in size, as also does the\r\nuterus. The very framework of the structure does not escape. The bones\r\nincrease in weight, and those around the hips expand, and give the\r\nfemale her distinctive form, upon the perfection of which her life and\r\nthat of her children depend.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTAL CHANGES.\r\n\r\nSuch are the changes which strike the eye. But there are others which\r\nare not less significant, and which demand far more urgently our\r\nwatchful heed. New thoughts, strange desires, are invading the soul. A\r\nnovel relation is assumed to the world. It is vague, misunderstood, but\r\ndisturbing all the same.\r\n\r\nThe once light-hearted girl inclines to reveries; she seeks solitude;\r\nher mother surprises her in causeless tears; her teacher discovers an\r\nunwonted inattention to her studies, a less retentive memory, a\r\ndisinclination to mental labor; her father misses her accustomed\r\nplayfulness; he, perhaps, is annoyed by her listlessness and inertia.\r\nWhat does it all mean? What is the matter with the girl?\r\n\r\nMother, teacher, father, it is for you to know the answers to these\r\nquestions. You have guarded this girl through years of helpless infancy\r\nand thoughtless childhood. At the peril of her life, and of what is of\r\nmore value than life, do not now relax your vigilance. Every day the\r\nreaper Death reaps with his keen sickle the flowers of our land. The\r\nmothers weep, indeed; but little do they realize that it is because they\r\nhave neglected to cherish them as was their duty, that the Lord of\r\nParadise has taken them back unto Himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPLETION OF PUBERTY.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms increase until at length the system has acquired the\r\nnecessary strength, and furnished itself with reserve forces enough to\r\ncomplete its transformation. Then the monthly flow commences.\r\n\r\nIn thoroughly healthy girls it continues to recur at regular intervals,\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty days apart. This is true of about three out\r\nof four. In others, a long interval, sometimes six months, occurs\r\nbetween the first and second sickness. If the general health be not _in\r\nthe least_ impaired, this need cause no anxiety. Irregularities are\r\nfound in the first year or two, which often right themselves afterwards.\r\nBut whenever they are associated with the _slightest_ signs of mental or\r\nbodily disorder, they demand instant and intelligent attention.\r\n\r\nIt used to be supposed that the periods of the monthly sickness were in\r\nsome way connected with the phases of the moon. So general is this\r\nbelief even yet in France, that a learned Academician not long since\r\nthought it worth while carefully to compare over four thousand\r\nobservations, to see whether they did bear any relations to the lunar\r\nphases. It is hardly worth while to add that he found none.\r\n\r\nWe have known perfectly healthy young women who were ill every sixteen\r\ndays, and others in whom a period of thirty-five or thirty-six days\r\nwould elapse. The reasons of such differences are not clear. Some\r\ninherited peculiarity of constitution is doubtless at work. Climate is\r\nof primary importance. Travellers in Lapland, and other countries in the\r\nfar north, say that the women there are not regulated more frequently\r\nthan three or four times a year. Hard labor and a phlegmatic temperament\r\nusually prolong the interval between the periodical illnesses.\r\n\r\nAn equal diversity prevails in reference to the _length of time_ the\r\ndischarge continues. The average of a large number of cases observed in\r\nhealthy women, between the ages of fifteen and thirty-five, is four days\r\nand a fraction. In a more general way, we may say from two to six days\r\nis the proper duration. Should it diverge widely from this, then it is\r\nlikely some mischief is at work.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the _amount_ of the discharge, every woman is a law unto\r\nherself. Usually, it is four or five ounces in all. Habits of life are\r\napt to modify it materially. Here, again, those exposed to prolonged\r\ncold and inured to severe labor escape more easily than their sisters\r\npetted in the lap of luxury. Delicate, feeble, nervous women--those, in\r\nother words, who can least afford the loss of blood--are precisely those\r\nwho lose the most. Nature, who is no tender mother, but a stern\r\nstep-mother, thus punishes them for disregarding her laws. Soft\r\ncouches, indolent ease, highly spiced food; warm rooms, weak\r\nmuscles,--these are the infractions of her rules which she revenges with\r\nvigorous, ay, merciless severity.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, too, that excitement of the emotions, whether of\r\nanger, joy, grief, hatred, or love increases the discharge. Even the\r\nvulgar are aware of this, and, misinterpreting it as half-knowledge\r\nalways does, suppose it a sign of stronger animal passions. It bears no\r\nsuch meaning. But the fact reads us a lesson how important it is to\r\ncultivate a placid mind, free from strong desire or fear, and to hold\r\nall our emotions in the firm leash of reason.\r\n\r\nPhysicians attach great importance to the _character_ of the discharge.\r\nIt should be thin, watery, dark-coloured, and never clot. If it clots,\r\nit is an indication that something is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DANGERS OF PUBERTY.\r\n\r\nWe have shown that there are constantly individual deviations, quite\r\nconsistent with health, from any given standard. They only become\r\nsignificant of disease when they depart decidedly from the average,\r\neither in the frequency of the illness, its duration, the amount of the\r\ndischarge, or the character. More or less pain, more or less prostration\r\nand general disturbances at these epochs, are universal and inevitable.\r\nThey are part of the sentence which at the outset He pronounced upon the\r\nwoman, when He said unto her, 'I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and\r\nthy conception.' Yet with merciful kindness He has provided means by\r\nwhich the pain may be greatly lessened, and the sorrow avoided; and\r\nthat we may learn and observe these means, their neglect often increases\r\na hundred-fold the natural suffering.\r\n\r\nAt this critical period, the seeds of hereditary and constitutional\r\ndiseases manifest themselves. They draw fresh malignancy from the new\r\nactivity of the system. The first symptoms of tubercular consumption, of\r\nscrofula, of obstinate and disfiguring skin diseases, of hereditary\r\ninsanity, of congenital epilepsy, of a hundred terrible maladies, which\r\nfrom birth have lurked in the child, biding the opportunity of attack,\r\nsuddenly spring from their lairs, and hurry her to the grave or the\r\nmadhouse. If we ask why so many fair girls of eighteen or twenty are\r\nfollowed by weeping friends to an early tomb, the answer is, chiefly\r\nfrom diseases which had their origin at the period of puberty.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for us here to rehearse all the minute symptoms, each\r\nalmost trifling in itself, which warn the practised physician of the\r\napproach of one of these fearful foes in time to allow him to make a\r\ndefence. We can do little more than iterate the warning, that whenever,\r\nat this momentous epoch, any disquieting change appears, be it physical\r\nor mental, let not a day be lost in summoning _skilled_, _competent_\r\nmedical advice.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a train of symptoms so frequent, so insidious, so\r\nfruitful with agony of mind and body, that we shall mention them\r\nparticularly. They illustrate, at once, how all-important is close\r\nobservation, and how significant to the wise physician are trifles\r\nseemingly light as air.\r\n\r\nIf you notice a girl of fourteen or sixteen, who, in walking, always\r\ngives one arm in preference to the other to her companion; if, in\r\nsleeping, she mostly lies on the same side; if, in sitting, she is apt\r\nto prefer a chair with a low back, and throws one arm over its back; if\r\nyou perceive that she always sits with one foot a little in advance of\r\nthe other; if she, on inquiry, confesses to slight, wandering pains in\r\none side of her chest,--do not chide her for awkwardness. These are\r\nominous portents. They mean _spinal disease_, than which a more fearful\r\nmalady is hardly known to medicine.\r\n\r\nNot less stealthy is the approach of disease of the hip-joint, of white\r\nswelling of the knee, of consumption,--all curable if taken in hand at\r\nthe very first, all well-nigh hopeless when they have once unmasked\r\ntheir real features.\r\n\r\nApart from these general dangers, to which those of thoroughly sound\r\nconstitutions are not exposed, there are disorders called functional, to\r\nwhich all are subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN SICKNESS.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of the 'green sickness,' we mention perhaps the most\r\ncommon of all, and one of which every mother has heard. Doctors call it\r\n_chlorosis_, which also means _greenness_; for one of its most common\r\nand peculiar symptoms is a pale complexion with a greenish tinge.\r\n\r\nIt never occurs except at or near the age of puberty, and was long\r\nsupposed to be merely an impoverishment of the blood. Now, however, we\r\nhave learned that it is a disease of the nervous system, and one very\r\noften confounded by physicians with other complaints.\r\n\r\nIts attack is insidious. A distaste for exertion and society, a fitful\r\nappetite, low spirits,--these are all the symptoms noticed at first.\r\nThen, one by one, come palpitation of the heart, an unhealthy\r\ncomplexion, irregularity, dyspepsia, depraved tastes,--such as a desire\r\nto eat slate-pencil dust, chalk, or clay,--vague pains in body and\r\nlimbs, a bad temper; until the girl, after several months, is a peevish,\r\nwretched, troublesome invalid.\r\n\r\nThen, if a physician is called in, and gives her iron, and tells her\r\nnothing is the matter, or is himself alarmed, and imagines she has heart\r\ndisease or consumption, it is a chance if she does not rapidly sink, out\r\nof mere fright and over-much dosing, into some fatal complaint. Let it\r\nbe well understood that chlorosis, though often obstinate and obscure,\r\nis always curable if properly and promptly treated. The remedies must be\r\naddressed to the nervous system, and can be administered with\r\nintelligence only by a competent medical adviser. It can be prevented by\r\na hygienic mode of life, and, as its most common causes are anxiety,\r\nhome-sickness, want of exercise, or overwork at school, nothing is so\r\nsalutary in its early stages as a change of air and scene, cheerful\r\ncompany, a tour to the mountains or some watering-place, and regular\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nMany young women suffer considerable pain during their monthly illness.\r\nThis may arise from many different causes, such as, congestion,\r\ninflammation, malformation, or a wrong position of the parts, or\r\nover-sensitive nerves. They can only be successfully treated when the\r\ncause is known; and they may rest assured that this suffering, in nearly\r\nevery case, can be removed.\r\n\r\nSometimes a girl grows to the age of eighteen or twenty without having\r\nher periodical changes. We have already said that this is not unusual in\r\nsome climates and in some families; so, as long as the general health is\r\ngood and the spirits cheerful,--always an important point,--it need\r\ncause no anxiety. But if the health grow poor, and especially if there\r\nbe pains and weakness recurring monthly without discharge, then\r\nsomething is wrong, and the doctor should be consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYSTERICS.\r\n\r\nThere is a disease of the nerves to which girls about the age of puberty\r\nare very subject, particularly in the higher circles of society, where\r\ntheir emotions are over-educated and their organization delicate. It is\r\ncalled hysteria, and more commonly _hysterics_. Frequently it deceives\r\nboth doctor and friends, and is supposed to be some dangerous complaint.\r\nOften it puts on the symptoms of epilepsy, or heart disease, or\r\nconsumption. We have witnessed the most frightful convulsions in girls\r\nof fourteen or fifteen, which were brought on by this complaint.\r\nSometimes it injures the mind; and it should always receive prompt and\r\nefficient attention, as it is always curable.\r\n\r\nThis disease is apt to produce a similar affection in other girls of the\r\nsame age who see the attacks. For this reason, hysterical girls should\r\nnot be sent to large schools, but cured at home. Often a strong mental\r\nimpression restores them. The anecdote is told of a celebrated surgeon\r\n(Boerhaave) who was called to a female seminary where there was a number\r\nof hysterical girls. He summoned them together, heated a number of iron\r\ninstruments before their eyes, and told them that the first one who had\r\na fit should be cauterized down the spine. They all recovered\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRET BAD HABITS.\r\n\r\nWe now approach a part of our subject which we would gladly omit, did\r\nnot constant experience admonish us of our duty to speak of it in no\r\nuncertain tone. We refer to the disastrous consequences on soul and body\r\nto which young girls expose themselves by exciting and indulging morbid\r\npassions. Years ago, Miss Catherine E. Beecher sounded a note of warning\r\nto the mothers of America on this secret vice, which leads their\r\ndaughters to the grave, the madhouse, or, worse yet, the brothel.\r\n\r\nGladly would we believe that her timely admonition had done away with\r\nthe necessity for its repetition. But though we believe such a habit is\r\nmore rare than many physicians suppose, it certainly exists to a degree\r\nthat demands attention. Surgeons have recently been forced to devise\r\npainful operations to hinder young girls from thus ruining themselves;\r\nand we must confess that, in its worst form, it is absolutely incurable.\r\n\r\nThe results of the constant nervous excitement which this habit produces\r\nare bodily weakness, loss of memory, low spirits, distressing\r\nnervousness, a capricious appetite, dislike of company and of study,\r\nand finally, paralysis, imbecility, or insanity. Let it not be supposed\r\nthat there are many who suffer thus severely; but, on the other hand,\r\nlet it be clearly understood that any indulgence whatever in these evil\r\ncourses is attended with bad effects, especially because they create\r\nimpure desires and thoughts, which will prepare the girl to be a willing\r\nvictim to the arts of profligacy. There is no more solemn duty resting\r\non those who have the charge of young females than to protect them\r\nagainst this vice.\r\n\r\nBut, it is exclaimed, is it not dangerous to tell them anything about\r\nit? Such a course is unnecessary. Teach them that any handling of the\r\nparts, any indecent language, any impure thought, is degrading and\r\nhurtful. See that the servants, nurses, and companions with whom they\r\nassociate are not debased; and recommend scrupulous cleanliness.\r\n\r\nIf the habit is discovered, do not scold nor whip the child. It is\r\n_often_ a result of disease, and induced by a disagreeable local\r\nitching. Sometimes this is connected with a disorder of the womb, and\r\nvery frequently with worms in the bowels. Let the case be submitted to a\r\njudicious, skilful medical adviser, and the girl will yet be saved. But\r\ndo not shut your eyes, and refuse to see this fact when it exists.\r\nMothers are too often unwilling to entertain for a moment the thought\r\nthat their daughters are addicted to such a vice, when it is only too\r\nplain to the physician.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HYGIENE OF PUBERTY.\r\n\r\nConcerning the maladies of puberty, we may broadly say, that if we are\r\nobliged to have recourse to medicine, it is because we have neglected\r\nhygiene. That the period requires assiduous care, we grant; but given\r\nthat care, drugs will be needless.\r\n\r\nIn a general way, we have already emphasized the danger of indolence and\r\nthe benefits of exercise or labor; the perils of exciting the emotions,\r\nand the advantages of a placid disposition; the impropriety of premature\r\ndevelopment, and the wisdom of simplicity and moderation. This is an old\r\nstory--a thrice-told tale. Let us go more into minutiæ.\r\n\r\nOne of the most frequent causes of disease, about the age of puberty, is\r\n_starvation_. Many a girl is starved to death. Food is given her, but\r\nnot of the right quality, or in insufficient quantity, or at improper\r\nhours. The system is not nourished, and, becoming feeble, it is laid\r\nopen to the attacks of disease, and to no form of disease more readily\r\nthan to consumption.\r\n\r\nTo correct this, let the food be varied, simply prepared, and abundant.\r\nGood fresh milk should be used daily, while tea and coffee should be\r\nwithheld. Fat meats and vegetable oils, generally disliked by girls at\r\nthis age, are exactly what they need; and were they partaken of more\r\nfreely, there would be less inquiry at the druggists for cod-liver oil.\r\n\r\nA modern writer of eminence lays it down as one of the most common\r\ncauses of consumption in young people, that just at the age when their\r\nphysical system is undergoing such important changes, that invaluable\r\narticle of diet, _milk_, is generally dropped, and nothing equally rich\r\nin nitrogen substituted in its place.\r\n\r\n_Exercise_, whether as games, the skipping rope, croquet, walking,\r\ndancing, riding, and calisthenics, or as regular labor, is highly\r\nbeneficial, especially when it leads one into the fresh air, the\r\nsunshine, and the country. A particular kind of exercise is to be\r\nrecommended for those whose chests are narrow, whose shoulders stoop,\r\nand who have a hereditary predisposition to consumption. If it is\r\nsystematically practised along with other means of health, we would\r\nguarantee any child, no matter how many relatives have died of this\r\ndisease, against its invasion. It is voluntary inspiration. Nothing is\r\nmore simple. Let her stand erect, throw the shoulders well back, and the\r\nhands behind; then let her slowly inhale pure air to the full capacity\r\nof the lungs, and retain it a few seconds _by an increased effort_; then\r\nit may be slowly exhaled. After one or two natural inspirations, let her\r\nrepeat the act, and so on for ten or fifteen minutes, twice daily. Not\r\nonly is this simple procedure a safeguard against consumption, but, in\r\nthe opinion of some learned physicians, it can even cure it when it has\r\nalready commenced.\r\n\r\nAt first the monthly loss of blood exhausts the system. Therefore,\r\nplenty of food, plenty of rest, plenty of sleep, are required. That\r\nancient prejudice in favour of early rising should be discarded now, and\r\nthe girl should retire early, and if she will, should sleep late. Hard\r\nstudy, care, or anxiety should be spared her. This is not the time for\r\nrigid discipline.\r\n\r\n_Clothing_ is a matter of importance, and, if we were at all sure of\r\nattention, there is much we would say of it. The thought seriously\r\ntroubles us, that so long as women consent to deform themselves and\r\nsacrifice their health to false ideas of beauty, it is almost hopeless\r\nto urge their fitness for, and their right to a higher life than they\r\nnow enjoy. No educated painter or sculptor is ignorant of what the model\r\nof female beauty is; no fashionable woman is content unless she departs\r\nfrom it as far as possible.\r\n\r\nNow beauty implies health, and ugliness of form is attained not only at\r\nthe expense of æsthetics, but of comfort. The custom of fastening\r\ngrowing girls in tight corsets, of flattening their breasts with pads,\r\nof distorting their feet in small high-heeled shoes, and of teaching\r\nthem to stoop and mince in gait, is calculated to disgust every observer\r\nof good sense and taste, and, what is of more consequence, to render\r\nthese girls, when they become women, more liable to every species of\r\nsuffering connected with child-bearing.\r\n\r\nThe monthly change is the prelude to maternity. On its healthful\r\nrecurrence depends present comfort and future health; and not these\r\nalone, but also happiness in marriage, easy child-beds, and the\r\nconstitution of children to a degree the thoughtless girl and even the\r\nmature woman rarely understand. She, therefore, who neglects the due\r\ncare of her own condition, violates a duty owed to others as well as\r\nherself. We would have mothers impress this on their daughters. Let no\r\nmistaken modesty prevent them.\r\n\r\nEspecially at their commencement should the monthly changes be carefully\r\nwatched. The mother should prepare her daughter's mind betimes for such\r\nan expected incident in her life, thus preventing a useless fright, or\r\nthe employment of injurious means to stop what the child may look upon\r\nas an accident.\r\n\r\nNor should the maternal care cease here. Such tender sympathy should\r\nexist on the one side, such trusting confidence on the other, that the\r\nmother should acquaint herself with every detail of each recurring\r\nperiod until the function is thoroughly established. She should inquire\r\ninto the duration of each epoch, the abundance of the discharge, the\r\npresence of pain, and its effects on the general health. She should\r\nconvince herself that all these do not vary from the standards of health\r\nwe have previously laid down. Or should they do so, she should not delay\r\nto use the proper means to bring them to that standard.\r\n\r\nLong observation proves that if, during the first two or three years\r\nwhich follow the attainment of puberty, the health of the girl is\r\nsuccessfully guarded, and this, her most important physical distinction,\r\nmeets with no derangement, her life-long health is well-nigh secured;\r\nbut, on the contrary, if she commences her sexual life with pain and\r\ndisorder, she is likely to be a life-long sufferer.\r\n\r\nWe are about to approach a topic of vital importance, therefore, in\r\nsumming up as briefly as may be, the precautions necessary to attain\r\nthis end. They can most conveniently be divided into those to be\r\nobserved during the monthly changes, and those more general rules of\r\nhealth to be obeyed in the intervals of the periods.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRECAUTIONS DURING THE MONTHLY CHANGES.\r\n\r\nAt the head of all cautions and warnings which we could give about the\r\ncare of the health at these monthly periods, we put _rest_, _rest_,\r\nbodily and mental. _Do less than usual_, we say to all, whether the\r\nnecessity for it is manifest or not. Over-exertion is a most fruitful\r\ncause of disease. Long walks, shopping, dancing, riding, hard work\r\nwhether for pleasure or profit, should be avoided to the utmost.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of rest cannot be over-estimated. A striking example of\r\nit occurs to our mind. Most readers are aware how toilsome are the lives\r\nof the Indian women among our Western tribes, and also how singularly\r\neasy and almost painless is their child-bearing. The pangs of travail\r\nare almost unknown to them. The cause of this has puzzled even\r\nphysicians. We can tell them. It is because it is an inviolable, a\r\nsacred rule among all those tribes, for the woman, when having her\r\nmonthly sickness, to drop all work, absent herself from the lodge, and\r\nremain in perfect rest as long as the discharge continues.\r\n\r\nTraces of this wide-spread custom among primitive people, extended\r\nthemselves, are discoverable among civilized lands. The famous general\r\ncouncil of the Christian Church held at Nice in the fourth century,\r\npassed a rule disapproving of women coming to church at the times of\r\ntheir menstrual sickness. The cold and dampness of large edifices, the\r\nmental excitement and its unfavourable effects and the exertion\r\nrequisite for long walks to and fro, would justify this rule on purely\r\nhygienic grounds, and such may have caused its adoption.\r\n\r\nA moderate and uniform temperature favors health at such epochs; while\r\nexposure to heat or cold, and the drinking freely of iced water or\r\nstimulants should be shunned.\r\n\r\nThe popular belief that bathing is hurtful, is correct so far as either\r\ncold or hot baths are concerned; but it is well to know, in the\r\ninterests of comfort and cleanliness, that a moderately warm-bath, about\r\n80° Fahr., _will do no injury_. Such a bath can be taken without any\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nWe sanction, also, another well-known rule, and that is, that no\r\npurgative medicine should be taken immediately before or during the\r\nchange. If called for by some other disorder, a mild laxative is all\r\nthat should be administered, unless by the direction of a physician.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRECAUTIONS IN THE INTERVALS OF THE MONTHLY CHANGES.\r\n\r\nIf girls suffer from irregularities in this respect, the causes can\r\ngenerally be found either in some affection threatening the general\r\nhealth, such as scrofula, consumption, green sickness, etc., or else in\r\ntheir mode of life. For the former, the family physician must be\r\nconsulted; but if it is the latter which is at fault, the remedy is in\r\nthe hands of the parents.\r\n\r\nBoarding-school life, city life, mental troubles--these are the three\r\nfertile sources of disturbances in the sexual functions of girlhood.\r\n\r\nNo one rates at higher value than ourselves the training of the mind;\r\nbut we do not hesitate a moment to urge that if perturbations of the\r\nfunctions become at all marked in a girl at school, she should be _taken\r\naway_. Better live at home in seeming idleness a year at that time of\r\nlife, than become a dead-weight, through constant ill health, on her\r\nhusband in after life.\r\n\r\nSo of the unwholesome excitement of a city life. There is a poison in\r\ncrowds, and it acts in a thousand unseen ways. With the ceaseless noise,\r\nthe broken sleep, the late hours, the impure air, and the nervous\r\ntension which all these produce, it requires no strength of imagination\r\nto perceive that the city is not the best place for the delicate girl.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned _mental troubles_. Perhaps there are, among those who\r\nread this, some superficial enough to smile at the possibility of\r\nserious mental troubles in girlhood. There are, we know, many unfeeling\r\nenough to give them no attention when they do see them. But we have an\r\nunfailing witness in the sympathetic heart of the mother. She has not\r\nforgotten how bitter were the crosses of her own younger years; she\r\nknows that the sensitive soul of woman wakes early to the keenest\r\nappreciation of grief as well as joy. If anything, years blunt us, and\r\nthe sorrows of youth are often the bitterest of our lives.\r\n\r\nLet the mother, therefore, read with her wondrous maternal instinct the\r\ntrials of her daughter; let her become her most intimate confidant, and\r\npour upon the wounded spirit that balm which none but a woman, and that\r\nwoman a mother, knows how to apply. Such a relationship of mother and\r\ndaughter is no less natural and wholesome than it is beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN THE CHANGES ARE DELAYED.\r\n\r\nIn health an equal interval, or one nearly equal, elapses between the\r\nmonthly illnesses. Often in the spring, however, their appearance\r\nanticipates the expected date of their occurrence, and in the autumn\r\nthey are frequently a day or two late. These variations are owing to the\r\ntemperature, heat accelerating and cold retarding the process of\r\novulation.\r\n\r\nSuch slight irregularities need not give rise to anxiety; but if there\r\nis an unwonted delay, combined with other symptoms of ill-health, as\r\nheadache, pain in the side and back, a sense of languor and exhaustion,\r\nloss of appetite, and nausea, and fitful sleep, then it is important\r\nthat some steps be taken to bring on the courses. For this purpose,\r\nsoaking the feet in hot-mustard water, a tumbler of hot ginger or\r\ncamomile-tea, a brisk walk, or a gentle laxative will generally be found\r\nsufficient. Gently kneading the lower abdomen and loins is a familiar,\r\nand if intelligently done, a safe means for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nMore violent means than these should be eschewed. Whichever are used\r\nsubsequent to their employment, rest, in a recumbent position, in a\r\nwarm room should be secured.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN THE CHANGES ARE PAINFUL.\r\n\r\nThere are wide individual differences in this respect. Some young women\r\nsuffer much from local pains, headache and languor at such epochs,\r\nwithout apparently losing anything in general health; others experience\r\nno distress whatever.\r\n\r\nThe causes of painful periods are various. Sometimes they depend on a\r\ntendency to rheumatism or to ague. Over-work, or excessive devotion to\r\nsocial duties and pleasures, is often their source. Cold and damp are\r\ncommon incidental causes. Green sickness and general debility are\r\nsometimes to blame.\r\n\r\nOf course the treatment must depend on which one of these is present. It\r\nis a good rule, however, always to wear flannel next the skin; also, to\r\navoid exposure to the weather for several days before the change is\r\nexpected. A large, hot, linseed-meal poultice, over which a\r\ndessert-spoonful of laudanum has been sprinkled, or a large\r\nmustard-plaster, spread on the lower abdomen, will afford much relief. A\r\nhot brick or bottle of hot water wrapped in flannel, and applied to the\r\nsmall of the back, is often of great service. Rest in bed is always to\r\nbe recommended. A tea-spoonful of sweet spirits of nitre will sometimes\r\nbring early relief.\r\n\r\nBut if these simple means are not sufficient, it would be better to\r\nconsult a physician.\r\n\r\nA common belief is that such troubles are cured by marriage. Sometimes\r\nthey are, but we do not approve the remedy. The state of marriage\r\nshould be entered upon in perfect health and full vigor. Upon it\r\ndepends the health of future generations, and it were better for them\r\ndid only those assume its bonds who are able to endow their children\r\nwith sound physical frames.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF NUBILITY.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, because a girl is capable of marriage, that she is\r\nfit for it. Science teaches us many valid objections to too early\r\nunions. It goes farther, and fixes a certain age at which it is wisest\r\nfor woman to marry. This age is between twenty and twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nAnatomists have learned that after puberty the bones of a woman's body\r\nundergo important modifications to fit her for child-bearing. This\r\nrequires time, and before twenty the process is not completed. Until the\r\nwoman is perfect herself, until her full stature and completed form are\r\nattained, she is not properly qualified to assist in perpetuating the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nWe might urge that up to this moment neither does her self-knowledge\r\nqualify her to choose a life-companion, nor can her education be\r\nfinished, nor is her experience sufficient for her to enter on the\r\nduties of a matron. But we do not appeal to these arguments. There are\r\nothers still more forcible. If her own health, life, and good looks are\r\nof value to her, if she has any wish for healthy, sound minded children,\r\nshe will refrain from premature nuptials.\r\n\r\nA too youthful wife finds marriage not a pleasure but a pain. Her\r\nnervous system is prostrated by it; she is more liable to weakness and\r\ndiseases of the womb; and if of a consumptive family, she runs great\r\nrisk of finding that fatal malady manifest itself after a year or two of\r\nwedded life. It is very common for those who marry young to die young.\r\n\r\nFrom statistics which have been carefully compiled, it is proven that\r\nthe first labors of very young mothers are much more painful, tedious,\r\nand dangerous to life, than others. As wives, they are frequently\r\nvisited either with absolute sterility, and all their lives must bear\r\nthe reproach of barren women, or, what to many is hardly less\r\ndistasteful, they have an excessively numerous family.\r\n\r\nWhat adds to their sufferings in the latter event, is that the children\r\nof such marriages are rarely healthy. They are feeble, sickly,\r\nundersized, often with some fault of mind or body, which is a cross to\r\nthem and their parents all their lives. They inherit more readily the\r\ndefects of their ancestors, and, as a rule, die at earlier years than\r\nthe progeny of better-timed unions.\r\n\r\nThese considerations are formidable enough, it would seem, to prevent\r\nyoung girls from marrying, without the need of a law, as exists in some\r\ncountries. Moreover, they are not imaginary, but real, as many a woman\r\nfinds out to her cost.\r\n\r\nThe objections to marriage after the age of twenty-five are less cogent.\r\nThey extend only to the woman herself. She should know that the first\r\nlabors of wives over thirty are nearly _twice_ as fatal as those between\r\ntwenty and twenty-five. Undoubtedly nature points to the period between\r\nthe twentieth and twenty-fifth year as the fittest one for marriage in\r\nthe woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_LOVE._\r\n\r\n\r\nITS POWER ON HUMANITY.\r\n\r\nLove, pure love, true love, what can we say of it? The dream of youth;\r\nthe cherished reminiscence of age; celebrated in the songs of poets;\r\nthat which impels the warrior to his most daring deeds; which the\r\ninspired prophet chooses to typify the holiest sentiments,--what new\r\nthing is it possible to say about this theme?\r\n\r\nThink for a moment on the history or the literature of the world. Ask\r\nthe naturalist to reveal the mysteries of life; let the mythologist\r\nexplain the origin and meaning of all unrevealed religions; look within\r\nat the promptings of your own spirit, and this whole life of ours will\r\nappear to you as one grand epithalamium.\r\n\r\nThe profoundest of English poets has said--\r\n\r\n    'All thoughts, all passions, all delights,\r\n      Whatever stirs this mortal frame,\r\n    All are but ministers of Love,\r\n      And feed his sacred flame.'\r\n\r\nThat life which is devoid of love is incomplete, sterile,\r\nunsatisfactory. It fails of its chiefest end. Nature, in anger, blots it\r\nout sooner, and it passes like the shadow of a cloud, leaving no trace\r\nbehind. Admirable as it may be in other respects, to the eye of the\r\nstatesman, the physician, the lover of his species, it remains but a\r\nfragment, a torso.\r\n\r\nLove is one thing to a woman, another to a man. To him, said Madame de\r\nStaël, it is an episode; to her, it is the whole history of life. A\r\nthousand distractions divert man. Fame, riches, power, pleasure, all\r\nstruggle in his bosom to displace the sentiment of love. They are its\r\nrivals, not rarely its masters. But woman knows no such distractions.\r\nOne passion only sits enthroned in her bosom; one only idol is enshrined\r\nin her heart, knowing no rival, no successor. This passion is love! This\r\nidol is its object.\r\n\r\nThis is not fancy, not rhetoric; it is the language of cold and exact\r\nscience, pronounced from the chair of history, from the bureau of the\r\nstatistician, from the dissecting table of the anatomist. We shall\r\ngather up their well-weighed words, and present them, not as fancy\r\nsketches, but as facts.\r\n\r\nThis deep, all-absorbing, single, wondrous love of woman, is something\r\nthat man cannot understand. This sea of unfathomed depth is to him a\r\nmystery. The shallow mind sees of it nothing but the rippling waves, the\r\nunstable foam-crests dashing hither and thither, the playful ripples of\r\nthe surface, and, blind to the still and measureless waters beneath,\r\ncalls woman capricious, uncertain,--_varium et mutabile_. But the\r\nthinker and seer, undeceived by such externals, knows that beneath this\r\nseeming change is stability unequaled in the stronger sex, a power of\r\nwill to which man is a stranger, a devotion and purpose which strike him\r\nwith undefined awe.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the myths and legends which the early races framed to\r\nexpress their notions of divine things,--the Fates, who spin and snip\r\nthe thread of life; the Norns, who\r\n\r\n    Lay down laws,\r\n    And select life\r\n    For the children of time--\r\n    The destinies of men,--\r\n\r\nare always females. The seeresses and interpreters of oracles--those\r\nwho, like the witch of Endor, could summon from the grave the shades of\r\nthe departed--were women.\r\n\r\nTherefore, also, modern infidelity, going back, as it ever does, to the\r\nignorance of the past, and holding it up as something new, makes woman\r\nthe only deity. Comte and his disciples, having reasoned away all gods,\r\nangels, and spirits, and unable to still the craving for something to\r\nadore, agree to meet once a week to worship--woman. The French\r\nrevolutionists, having shut up the churches and abolished God by a\r\ndecree of the Convention, set up in His stead--a woman.\r\n\r\nWe could never exhaust this phase of world-history. Everywhere we see\r\nthe unexpected hand of Love moulding, fashioning all things. The\r\nfortunes of the individual, the fate of nations, the destinies of races,\r\nare guided by this invisible thread. Let us push our inquiries as to the\r\nnature of this all-powerful agent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS LOVE?\r\n\r\nIt has a divided nature. As we have an immortal soul, but a body of\r\nclay; as the plant roots itself in decaying earth, but spreads its\r\nflowers in glorious sunlight,--so love has a physiological and a moral\r\nnature. It is rooted in that unconscious law of life which bids us\r\nperpetuate our kind; which guards over the conservation of life; which\r\nenforces, with ceaseless admonition, that first precept which God gave\r\nto man before the gates of Eden had been closed upon him: 'Be thou\r\nfruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.' Nothing but a spurious\r\ndelicacy, or an ignorance of facts, can prevent our full recognition\r\nthat love looks to marriage, and marriage to offspring, as a natural\r\nsequence.\r\n\r\nDo we ask proofs of this? We have them in abundance. Those unfortunate\r\nbeings who are chosen by Oriental custom to guard the seraglios undergo\r\na mutilation which disqualifies them from becoming parents. Soon all\r\ntraces of passion, all regard for the other sex, all sentiments of love,\r\ntotally disappear. The records of medicine contain not a few cases where\r\ndisease had rendered it necessary to remove the ovaries from women. At\r\nonce a change took place in voice, appearance, and mind. They spoke like\r\nmen, a slender beard commenced on their faces, a masculine manner was\r\nconspicuous in all their motions, and every thought of sexual love\r\npassed away for ever. These are the results in every case. What do they\r\nsignify? Undoubtedly that the passion of love is dependent upon the\r\ncapacity of having offspring, and that such was the intention of Nature\r\nin implanting in our bosom this all-powerful sentiment.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. Nature, as beneficent to those who obey her\r\nprecepts as she is merciless to those who disregard them, has added to\r\nthis sentiment of love a physical pleasure in its gratification,--an\r\nhonourable and proper pleasure, which none but the hypocrite or the\r\nascetic will affect to condemn, none but the coarse or the lewd will\r\nregard as the object of love. There is, indeed, a passion which is the\r\nlove of the body. We call it by its proper name of _lust_. There is\r\nanother emotion, for which the rich tongue of the ancient Greeks had a\r\nword, to which we have nothing to correspond. Call it, if you will,\r\nPlatonic love, and define it to be an exalted friendship. But understand\r\nthat neither the one nor the other is _love_, in the true sense of the\r\nword, and that _both_ are inferior to it.\r\n\r\nDoes the father, watching, with moistened eyes, his child at its\r\nmother's breast; does the husband, bending with solicitude over the\r\nsick-bed of his wife; does the wife, clinging to her husband through\r\nevil report and good report, through broken fortunes and failing health,\r\nindicate no loftier emotion than _lust_, no warmer sentiment than\r\n_friendship_? What ignorance, what perversity is so gross as not to\r\nperceive something here nobler than either? Do you say that such scenes\r\nare, alas, rare? We deny it. We see them daily in the streets; we meet\r\nthem daily in our rounds. Admitted, by our calling, to the sacred\r\nprecincts of many houses in the trying hours of sickness and death, we\r\nspeak advisedly, and know that this is the prevailing meaning of love in\r\ndomestic life.\r\n\r\nA warm, rich affection blesses the one who gives and the one who\r\nreceives. Character developes under it as the plant beneath the\r\nsunlight. Happiness is an unknown word without it. Love and marriage are\r\nthe only normal conditions of life. Without them, both man and woman for\r\never miss the best part of themselves. They suffer more, they sin more,\r\nthey perish sooner. These are not hasty assertions. As a social law, let\r\nit be well understood that science pronounces that\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVE IS A NECESSITY.\r\n\r\nThe single life is forced upon many of both sexes, in our present social\r\ncondition. Many choose it from motives of economy, from timidity, or as\r\na religious step, pleasing to God. The latter is a notion which probably\r\narose from a belief that, somehow, celibacy, strictly observed, means\r\nchastity. It simply means continence. The chastest persons have been,\r\nand are, not the virgins and celibates, but the married. When this truth\r\nis known better, we shall have fewer sects and more religion.\r\n\r\nWe know women who refrain from marrying to keep out of trouble. The old\r\nsaying is, that every sigh drives a nail in one's coffin. They are not\r\ngoing to worry themselves to death bearing children and nursing them! It\r\nis too great a risk, too much suffering. How often have we been told\r\nthis! Yet how false the reasoning is! Very carefully prepared statistics\r\nshow that between the ages of twenty and forty-five years, more\r\nunmarried women die than married, and few instances of remarkable\r\nlongevity in an old maid are known. The celebrated Dr. Hufeland,\r\ntherefore, in his treatise on the _Art_ _of Prolonging Life_, lays it\r\ndown as a rule, that to attain a great age, one must be married.\r\n\r\nAs for happiness, those who think they can best attain it outside the\r\ngentle yoke of matrimony are quite as wide of the mark. Their selfish\r\nand solitary pleasures do not gratify them. With all the resources of\r\nclubs, billiard-rooms, saloons, narcotics, and stimulants, single men\r\nmake but a mock show of satisfaction. At heart every one of them envies\r\nhis married friends. How much more monotonous and more readily exhausted\r\nare the resources of woman's single life! No matter what 'sphere' she is\r\nin, no matter in what 'circle' she moves, no matter what 'mission' she\r\ninvents, it will soon pall on her. Would you see the result? We invoke\r\nonce more those dry volumes, full of lines and figures, on vital\r\nstatistics. Stupid as they look, they are full of the strangest stories;\r\nand what is more, the stories are all true. Some of them are sad\r\nstories, and this is one of the saddest: Of those unfortunates who, out\r\nof despair and disgust of the world, jump from bridges, or take arsenic,\r\nor hang themselves, or in other ways rush unbidden and unprepared before\r\nthe great Judge of all, _nearly two-thirds_ are unmarried, and in some\r\nyears nearly _three-fourths_. And of those other sad cases--dead, yet\r\nliving--who people the madhouses and asylums, what of them? Driven crazy\r\nby their brutal husbands, do you suggest? Not at all! In France,\r\nBavaria, Prussia, Hanover, four out of every five are unmarried; and\r\nthroughout the civilised world there are everywhere three or four single\r\nto one married woman in the establishments for the insane, in\r\nproportion to the whole number of the two classes above twenty-one years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\nOther women decline to marry because they have, forsooth, a 'life work'\r\nto accomplish. Some great project fills their mind. Perchance they\r\nemulate Madame de Staël, and would electrify the country by their novel\r\nviews in politics; or they have a literary vein they fain would exploit;\r\nor they feel called upon to teach the freedmen, or to keep their\r\nposition as leaders of fashion. A husband would trammel them. If they\r\ndid marry, they would take the very foolish advice of a contemporary,\r\nand go through life with an indignant protest at its littleness. Let\r\nsuch women know that they underrate the married state, its powers and\r\nits opportunities. There are no loftier missions than can there be\r\ncarried out, no nobler games than can there be played. When we think of\r\nthese objections, coming, as they have to us, from high-spirited,\r\nearnest girls, the queens of their sex, our memory runs back to the\r\nfamous women of history, the brightest jewels in the coronet of time,\r\nand we find as many, ay, more, married women than single who pursued to\r\ntheir ends mighty achievements.\r\n\r\nIf you speak of Judith and Joan of Arc, who delivered their fatherlands\r\nfrom the enemy by a daring no man can equal, we shall recall the\r\npeaceful victories of her, wife of the barbarian Chlodwig, who taught\r\nthe rude Franks the mild religion of Nazareth, and of her who extended\r\nfrom Byzantium the holy symbol of the cross over the wilds of Russia.\r\nThe really great women of this age, are they mostly married or single?\r\nThey are mostly married, and they are good wives and tender mothers.\r\n\r\nWhat we have just written, we read to an amiable woman.\r\n\r\n'But,' she exclaimed, 'what have you to say to her whom high duties or a\r\nhard fate condemns to a single life, and to the name of the old maid?'\r\n\r\nAlas! what can we say to such? We feel that\r\n\r\n    'Earthlier happy is the rose distilled,\r\n    Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,\r\n    Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.'\r\n\r\nYet there is ever a blessing in store for those who suffer here, and the\r\nhope of the future must teach them to bear the present.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVE IS ETERNAL.\r\n\r\nWe have said love is a necessity in the life of either man or woman to\r\ncomplete their nature. Its effects, therefore, are eternal. We do not\r\nintend this as a figure of speech. It is a sober statement of\r\nphysiology.\r\n\r\nFrom the day of marriage the woman undergoes a change in her whole\r\nstructure. She is similar to her former self, but not the same. It is\r\noften noticed that the children of a woman in her second marriage bear a\r\nmarked resemblance to her first husband. In the inferior races and lower\r\nanimals this obscure metamorphosis is still more apparent. A negress who\r\nhas borne her first child to a white man, will ever after have children\r\nof a color lighter than her own. Count Strzelewski, in his Travels in\r\nAustralia, narrates this curious circumstance: A native woman who has\r\nonce had offspring by a white man, can never more have children by a\r\nmale of her own race. Dr. Darwin relates that a male zebra was once\r\nbrought to England, and a hybrid race, marked by the zebra's stripes,\r\nwas produced from certain mares. Always after, the colts of those mares\r\nbore the marks of the zebra on their skins. In some way the female is\r\nprofoundly altered throughout her whole formation, and entirely\r\nindependent of her will, by the act of marriage, and the alteration is\r\nnever effaced.\r\n\r\nIf the body is thus influenced, shall not the far more susceptible mind\r\nand spirit be equally impressed?\r\n\r\nAnother common observation supports what we say, and extends it farther.\r\nNot the woman alone,--the man also undergoes a change, and loses a\r\nportion of his personality in his mate. They two are one, not merely in\r\na moral sense. We constantly notice a decided resemblance in old couples\r\nwho have passed, say, two score years together. They have grown to look\r\nalike in form, feature, and expression. That for so long a time they\r\nhave breathed the same air, eaten the same fare, and been subjected to\r\nthe same surroundings, explains this to some extent. But the greater\r\npart of the change flows from mental sources. They have laughed and wept\r\ntogether; they have shared the same joys and pleasures; a smile or a\r\ntear on the face of one has evoked a corresponding emotion and\r\nexpression on the face of the other. Their co-partnership has become a\r\nunity. Even without speaking, they sympathize. Their souls are\r\nconstantly _en rapport_. The man is as different as the woman from his\r\nformer self.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF SECOND MARRIAGES.\r\n\r\nScience, therefore, seems to say to woman, 'Your first husband is your\r\neternal husband.' How, then, about second marriages? Are we to say that\r\nthey are not advisable?\r\n\r\nLet us not answer hastily. It is yet to be seen whether ill-assorted\r\nmarriages produce those impressions we have mentioned. They may, indeed,\r\non the body, while the mind is free. One must remember, also, that the\r\nexigencies of social life must be consulted. If a woman cannot love two\r\nmen equally,--and she cannot,--other motives, worthy of all respect,\r\njustify her in entering the marriage life a second time. Then, the\r\nhigher refinements of the emotions are not given to all alike, nor do\r\nthey come at the same age to all. True love may first dawn upon a woman\r\nafter one or two husbands have left her a widow. Orphan children,\r\nwidow-hood, want of property, or the care of property,--these are sad\r\nafflictions to the lonely woman. Do not blame her if she accepts a\r\nhusband as a guardian, a protector, whom she can no longer receive to\r\nher arms as a lover. She is right.\r\n\r\nWe cherish the memory of a lady of strong character, who died past\r\neighty. She had survived three husbands. 'The first,' she said, 'I\r\nmarried for love, the second for position, the third for friendship. I\r\nwas happy with them all.' But when, in her mortal illness, this\r\nvenerable friend sank into the delirium which preceded death, she\r\nconstantly called out the name of her first husband only. More than\r\nhalf a century had not effaced the memory of those few years of early\r\nlove. This is fidelity indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF DIVORCE.\r\n\r\nHe of Nazareth laid down the law that whoever puts away his wife for any\r\ncause except adultery, and marries again, commits adultery; and that\r\nwhatever woman puts away her husband for any cause save adultery, and\r\nmarries again, herself commits adultery.\r\n\r\nThis has been found a hard saying.\r\n\r\nJohn Milton wrote a book to show that the Lawgiver did not mean what He\r\nsaid, but something quite different. Modern sects, calling themselves\r\n_Christians_, after this Lawgiver, dodge the difficulty, and refer it to\r\nState legislatures. State legislatures, not troubling themselves at all\r\nabout any previous law or lawgiver, allow dozens of causes--scores of\r\nthem--as perfectly valid to put asunder those whom God has joined\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nScience, which never finds occasion to disagree with that Lawgiver of\r\nNazareth, here makes His words her own.\r\n\r\nWhether we look at it as a question in social life, in morals, or in\r\nphysiology, the American plan of granting absolute divorces is\r\ndangerous, and destructive to what is best in life. It leads to hasty,\r\nill-assorted matches, to an unwillingness to yield to each other's\r\npeculiarities, to a weakening of the family ties, to a lax morality.\r\nCarry it a trifle farther than it now is in some of the Western States,\r\nand marriage will lose all its sacredness, and degenerate into a\r\nphysical union, not nobler than the crossing of flies in the air.\r\n\r\nSeparation of bed and board should always be provided for by law; and\r\nwhether single, married, or separated, the woman should retain entire\r\ncontrol of her own property. But in the eyes of God and nature, a woman\r\nor a man with two faithful spouses living, to each of whom an eternal\r\nfidelity has been plighted, is a monster.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF A PLURALITY OF WIVES OR HUSBANDS.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said of divorce applies with tenfold force to the custom\r\nof a woman living as wife to several men, or of a man as husband to\r\nseveral women. We should not speak of these customs, but that we know\r\nboth exist in America, not among the notoriously wicked, but among those\r\nwho claim to be the peculiarly good--the very elect of God. They\r\nprevail, not as lustful excesses, but as religious observances.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to say that such practices lead to physical\r\ndegradation. The woman who acknowledges more than one husband is\r\ngenerally sterile; the man who has several wives has usually a weakly\r\noffspring, principally males. Nature attempts to check polygamy by\r\nreducing the number of females, and failing in this, by enervating the\r\nwhole stock. The Mormons of Utah would soon sink into a state of Asiatic\r\neffeminacy were they left to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURTSHIP.\r\n\r\nA wise provision of nature ordains that _woman shall be sought_. She\r\nflees, and man pursues. The folly of modern reformers, who would annul\r\nthis provision, is evident. Were it done away with, man, ever prone to\r\nyield to woman's solicitations, and then most prone when yielding is\r\nmost dangerous, would fritter away his powers at an early age, and those\r\nvery impulses which nature has given to perpetuate the race would bring\r\nabout its destruction.\r\n\r\nTo prevent such a disaster, woman is endowed with a sense of shame, an\r\ninvincible modesty, her greatest protection, and her greatest charm. Let\r\nher never forget it, never disregard it; for without it she becomes the\r\nscorn of her own sex and the jest of the other.\r\n\r\nThe urgency of man and the timidity of woman are tempered by the period\r\nof courtship.\r\n\r\nThis, as it exists in the United States, is something almost peculiar to\r\nAmericans. On the continent of Europe, girls are shut up in convents or\r\nin seminaries, or are kept strictly under the eyes of their parents\r\nuntil marriage, or, at any rate, betrothal. The liberty usual in America\r\nis something unheard-of and inconceivable there. In Spain a duenna, in\r\nFrance some aunt or elderly cousin, in Germany some similar person,\r\nmakes it her business to be present at every interview which a young\r\nlady has with an admirer. He never dreams of walking, driving, or going\r\nout of an evening with her alone. It is taken for granted that, should\r\nhe invite her for such a purpose, the mother or aunt is included in the\r\nparty. They would look on the innocent freedom of American girls as\r\nsimply scandalous.\r\n\r\nWe have had opportunities to see society in these various countries, and\r\nhave failed to perceive that the morality of either sex is at all\r\nsuperior to what it is with us, while the effect of cloister-like\r\neducation on young women is to weaken their self-reliance, and often\r\nprepare them for greater extravagances when marriage gives them liberty.\r\n\r\nWith us, the young woman is free until her wedding day. After that\r\nepoch, she looks forward to withdrawing more or less from society, and\r\nconfining her thoughts to family matters. In France, Spain, or Italy, in\r\nthe wealthier classes, precisely the contrary is the rule. Marriage\r\nbrings deliverance from an irksome espionage and numberless fetters; it\r\nis the avenue to a life in public and independent action. How injurious\r\nto domestic happiness this is, can readily be imagined.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the liberty of American girls occasionally leads to\r\nimproprieties. But, except in certain great cities, such instances are\r\nrare. The safeguards of virtue are knowledge and self-command, not\r\nduennas and _jalousies_. Let mothers properly instruct their daughters,\r\nand they need have no apprehension about their conduct.\r\n\r\nThe period of courtship is one full of importance. A young woman of\r\nunripe experience must decide from what she can see of a man during the\r\nintercourse of a few months, whether he will suit her for a\r\nlife-companion. She has no knowledge of human nature; and what would it\r\navail her if she had, when at such a time a suitor is careful only to\r\nshow his eligible traits? 'Go a-courting,' said old Dr Franklin, in his\r\nhomely language, 'in your everyday clothes.' Not one man out of a\r\nthousand is honest enough to take his advice.\r\n\r\nIt is useless for her to ask aid of another. She must judge for herself.\r\nWhat, then, is she to do?\r\n\r\nThere is a mysterious instinct in a pure-minded woman which is beyond\r\nall analysis,--a tact which men do not possess, and do not readily\r\nbelieve in. At such a crisis this instinct saves her. She feels in a\r\nmoment the presence of a base, unworthy nature. An unconscious repulsion\r\nis manifest in her eye, her voice. Where a suitor is not a man of low\r\nmotive, but merely quite incongruous in temper and disposition, this\r\nsame instinct acts, and the man, without being able to say just why,\r\nfeels that he is laboring in vain. If he blindly insists in his wooing,\r\nhe has no one to chide but himself when he is finally discarded.\r\n\r\nBut if the man is worthy, and suitable, does this blessed instinct\r\nwhisper the happy news with like promptness to the maiden's soul? Ah!\r\nthat raises another issue. It brings us face to face with that difficult\r\nquestion of\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.\r\n\r\nJung Stilling, a German author of note, a religious enthusiast, and full\r\nof queer fancies, was, when young, a tutor in a private family. On one\r\noccasion his employer took him to a strange house, and introduced him\r\nto a roomful of company. Stilling had not contemplated marriage; but, in\r\nthe company, he saw, for the first time, a young woman who he felt was\r\nhis destined wife. Walking across the room, he addressed her with the\r\nutmost simplicity, telling her that an inward monitor advised him that\r\nshe, of all womankind, was his predestined helpmeet. She blushed, was\r\nconfused, but presently confessed that she had experienced the same\r\nconviction on first beholding him. They married, and the most curious\r\npart of the tale remains to tell,--it is, that they proved a happy,\r\nwell-matched couple.\r\n\r\nWe do not advise others to follow their example. Not many souls are\r\ncapable of such reciprocity. Choosing an associate for life is too\r\nserious a business to be made the affair of a moment. Reason,\r\nreflection, thought, prayer,--these are aids in such a momentous\r\nquestion not to be lightly thrown aside. Many a passing fancy, many an\r\nevanescent preference, catches for a moment the new-fledged affections.\r\nBut for the long and tedious journey of life we want a love rooted in\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nWe are not blind to the fact, that often from the first interview the\r\nmaiden feels an undefined spell thrown around her by him who will become\r\nher husband. She feels differently in his presence; she watches him with\r\nother eyes than she has for the rest of men. She renders no account to\r\nherself of this emotion; she attempts no analysis of it; she does not\r\nacknowledge to herself that it exists. No matter. Sooner or later, if\r\ntrue to herself, she will learn what it is, and it will be a guide in\r\nthat moment, looked forward to with mingled hopes and fears, when she\r\nis asked to decide on the destiny, the temporal and eternal destiny, of\r\ntwo human lives.\r\n\r\nThat she may then decide aright, and live free from the regrets of a\r\nfalse step at this crisis of life, we shall now rehearse what medical\r\nscience has to say about\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO CHOOSE A HUSBAND.\r\n\r\n    'Choose well. Your choice is\r\n    Brief, and yet endless.'\r\n\r\nWoman holds as an inalienable right, in this country, the privilege of\r\nchoice. It is not left to notaries, or parents, to select for her, as is\r\nthe custom in some other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nFirst comes the question of relationship. A school-girl is apt to see\r\nmore of her cousins than of other young men. Often some of them seek at\r\nan early hour to institute a far closer tie than that of blood. Is she\r\nwise to accept it?\r\n\r\n\r\nSHALL COUSINS MARRY?\r\n\r\nHardly any point has been more warmly debated by medical men. It has\r\nbeen said that in such marriages the woman is more apt to be sterile;\r\nthat if she have children, they are peculiarly liable to be born with\r\nsome defect of body or mind,--deafness, blindness, idiocy, or lameness;\r\nthat they die early; and that they are subject, beyond others, to fatal\r\nhereditary diseases, as cancer, consumption, scrofula, etc.\r\n\r\nAn ardent physician persuaded himself so thoroughly of these evils\r\nresulting from marriage of relatives, that he induced the Legislature\r\nof Kentucky to pass a law prohibiting it within certain degrees of\r\nconsanguinity. Many a married couple have been rendered miserable by the\r\ninformation that they had unwittingly violated one of nature's most\r\npositive laws. Though their children may be numerous and blooming, they\r\nlive in constant dread of some terrible outbreak of disease. Many a\r\nyoung and loving couple have sadly severed an engagement, which would\r\nhave been a prelude to a happy marriage, when they were informed of\r\nthese disastrous results.\r\n\r\nFor all such we have a word of consolation. We speak it authoritatively,\r\nand not without a full knowledge of the responsibility we assume.\r\n\r\nThe risk of marrying a cousin, even a first cousin, is greatly\r\ndiminished, provided there is no decided hereditary taint in the family.\r\nAnd when such hereditary taint does exist, the danger is little more\r\nthan in marrying into any other family where it is also found. Indeed, a\r\ncertain German author has urged the propriety of such unions, where the\r\nfamily has traits of mental or physical excellence, as a means of\r\npreserving and developing them!\r\n\r\nSo far as sterility is concerned, an examination of records shows, that\r\nwhereas in the average of unions one women in _eight_ is barren, in\r\nthose between relatives but one in _ten_ is so. And as for the early\r\ndeaths of children, while, on an average, fifteen children in a hundred\r\ndie under seven years, in the families of nearly-related parents but\r\ntwelve in a hundred is the mortality as shown by French statistics.\r\n\r\nThe investigations about idiotic and defective children are by no means\r\nsatisfactory, and are considered by some of the most careful writers as\r\nnot at all proving a greater tendency to such misfortunes in the\r\noffspring of cousins. Among a thousand idiotic children recently\r\nexamined in Paris, not one was descended from a healthy consanguinity.\r\n\r\nBut as few families are wholly without some lurking predisposition to\r\ndisease, it is not well, as a rule, to run the risk of developing this\r\nby too repeated unions. Stock-breeders find that the best specimens of\r\nthe lower animals are produced by crossing nearly-related individuals a\r\ncertain number of times; but that, carried beyond this, such unions lead\r\nto degeneracy and sterility. Such, also, has been the experience of many\r\nhuman families.\r\n\r\nHow slight a cause even of that most insidious disease, consumption,\r\nsuch marriages are, may be judged from the fact, that of a thousand\r\ncases inquired into by Dr. Edward Smith, in only six was there\r\nconsanguinity of parents.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIXTURE OF RACES.\r\n\r\nMankind, say the school geographies, is divided into five races, each\r\ndistinguished by its own color. They are the white, the black, the red,\r\nthe yellow, and the brown races. In this country, practically, we have\r\nto do with but the white and black races; and the question is constantly\r\nasked, Shall we approve of marriages between them? Shall a white woman\r\nchoose a black man to be her husband?\r\n\r\nWe are at the more pains to answer this, because recently a writer--and\r\nthis writer a woman, and this woman one of the most widely known in our\r\nland--has written a novel intended to advocate the affirmative of this\r\nquestion. Moreover, it is constantly mooted in certain political\r\ncircles, and is one of the social problems of the day.\r\n\r\nThe very fact that it is so much discussed, shows that such a union runs\r\ncounter to a strong prejudice. Such aversions are often voices of\r\nnature, acting as warnings against acts injurious to the species. In\r\nthis instance it is not of modern origin, created by peculiar\r\ninstitutions. Three centuries ago, Shakspeare, who had probably never\r\nseen a score of negroes in his life, with the divination of genius, felt\r\nthe repugnance which a refined woman would feel to accepting one as her\r\nhusband. The plot of one of his plays turns on it. He makes Iago say of\r\nDesdemona:\r\n\r\n    'Not to affect many proposed matches\r\n    Of her own clime, complexion, and degree;\r\n    Whereto, we see, in all things nature tends:\r\n    Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,\r\n    Foul disproportions, thoughts unnatural.'\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, 'nature erring from itself' which prompts to these\r\nmarriages. They are not sterile, but the children are sickly and\r\nshort-lived. Very few mulattoes reach an old age.\r\n\r\nThen it is well known that the black race cannot survive a northern\r\nclimate. Dr. Snow, of Providence, Rhode Island, who has given great\r\nattention to the study of statistics, says emphatically that, in New\r\nEngland, the colored population inevitably perish in a few generations,\r\nif left to themselves. This debility no woman should wish to give to\r\nher children.\r\n\r\nA mental inferiority is likewise apparent. Friends of the negro are\r\nready to confess this, but attribute it to his long and recent period of\r\nservitude. We deal with facts only. The inferiority is there, whatever\r\nbe its cause; and she who would willingly curse her offspring with it,\r\nmanifests indeed 'thoughts unnatural.'\r\n\r\nThe children born of a union of the black and red race, negroes and\r\nIndians, are on the contrary, remarkable for their physical vigor and\r\nmental acuteness; though, of course, the latter is limited to the\r\ndemands of a semi-barbarous life.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOULD NATIVE WOMEN MARRY FOREIGNERS?\r\n\r\nWhen we narrow the question of race to that of nationality, entirely new\r\nelements come in.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the intermarriage of relatives, we showed that a certain\r\nnumber of such unions in healthy stocks was advantageous rather than\r\notherwise, but that too many of them lead to deterioration. This law can\r\nbe applied to nations. Historians have often observed that the most\r\npowerful states of the world arose from an amalgamation of different\r\ntribes. Rome, Greece, England, are examples of this. On the other hand,\r\nFrance, Russia, Spain, China, Persia, which have suffered no such\r\ncrosses of blood, are either stationary, or depend for their progress on\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nPhysicians have contributed other curious testimony on this point, the\r\nbearing of which they themselves have not understood. Marriages between\r\nnationalities of the same race are more fertile, and the children more\r\nvigorous, than those between descendants of the same nation. For\r\ninstance, it has been proved that if two descendants of the Pilgrim\r\nFathers in Massachusetts marry, they will probably have but three\r\nchildren; while, if one of them marries a foreigner, the children will\r\nnumber five or six.\r\n\r\nSo it is well ascertained that in the old and stationary communes of\r\nFrance, where the same families have possessed their small farms for\r\ngeneration after generation, the marriages have become gradually less\r\nand less productive, until it has seriously interfered with the quota\r\nthose districts send to the army.\r\n\r\nAmerican women have suffered many hard words because they do not have\r\nmore children. Several New England writers have accused them of very bad\r\npractices, which we shall mention hereafter. But the effect of the law\r\nof production just now laid down has been quite overlooked.\r\n\r\nAs it is best that there should be four or five children in a family in\r\nordinary circumstances, the union of American and foreign blood is very\r\ndesirable. We need to fuse in one the diverse colonies of the white race\r\nannually reaching our shores. A century should efface every trace of the\r\nGerman, the Irish, the Frenchman, the English, the Norwegian, and leave\r\nnothing but the American. To bring about this happy result, free\r\nintermarriage should be furthered in every possible way.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF THE HUSBAND.\r\n\r\nThe epoch of puberty comes to a boy at about the same age as it does to\r\na girl,--fourteen or fifteen years. And an even greater period passes\r\nbetween this epoch and the age it is proper for a man to marry,--his age\r\nof nubility.\r\n\r\nNot only has he a more complete education to obtain, not only a\r\nprofession or trade to learn, and some property to accumulate, some\r\nposition to acquire, ere he is ready to take a wife, but his physical\r\npowers ripen more slowly than those of woman. He is more tardy in\r\ncompleting his growth, and early indulgence more readily saps his\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nWe have placed the best age for woman to marry between twenty and\r\ntwenty-five years; for similar reasons, man is best qualified to become\r\na husband between twenty-three and thirty-three years.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the twenty-third year, many a man is incapable of producing\r\nhealthy children. If he does not destroy his health by premature\r\nindulgence, he may destroy his happiness by witnessing his children a\r\nprey to debility and deformity. An old German proverb says, 'Give a boy\r\na wife, and a child a bird, and death will soon knock at the door.' Even\r\nan author so old as Aristotle warns young men against early marriage,\r\nunder penalty of disease and puny offspring.\r\n\r\nFrom the age of thirty-three to fifty years, men who carefully observe\r\nthe laws of health do not feel any weight of years. Nevertheless, they\r\nare past their prime. Then, also, with advancing years, the chances of\r\nlife diminish, and the probability increases that they will leave a\r\nyoung family with no natural protector. The half-century once turned,\r\ntheir vigor rapidly diminishes. The marriages they then contract are\r\neither sterile, or yield but few and sickly children. Many an old man\r\nhas shortened his life by late nuptials; and the records of medicine\r\ncontain accounts of several who perished on the very night of marriage.\r\n\r\nThe relative age of man and wife is next to be considered. Nature fits\r\nwoman earlier for marriage, and hints thereby that she should, as a\r\nrule, be younger than her husband. So, too, the bard of nature speaks:\r\n\r\n              'Let still the woman take\r\n    An elder than herself; so wears she to him,\r\n    So sways she level in her husband's heart.'\r\n\r\nThe woman who risks her happiness with a man many years younger than\r\nherself, violates a precept of life; and when her husband grows\r\nindifferent, or taunts her with her years, or seeks companions of more\r\nsuitable age, she is reaping a harvest sown by her own hand.\r\n\r\nSo commonly do such matches turn out badly, that in 1828 the kingdom of\r\nWürtemberg prohibited unions where the woman was more than twelve years\r\nthe senior, except by special dispensation.\r\n\r\nAfter forty-five years, most women cannot hope for children. A marriage\r\nsubsequent to this period can at best be regarded as a close friendship.\r\nMarriage in its full meaning has no longer an existence.\r\n\r\nThe relative age of man and wife has another influence, and quite a\r\ncurious one. It influences the sex of the children. But this point we\r\nreserve for discussion on a later page.\r\n\r\nThe folly of joining a young girl to an old man is happily not so common\r\nin America as in Europe. It would be hard to devise any step more\r\ncertain to bring the laws of nature and morality into conflict.\r\n\r\n    'What can a young lassie do wi' an auld man?'\r\n\r\nWhat advice can we give to a woman who barters her youthful charms for\r\nthe fortune of an aged husband? Shall we be cynical enough to agree with\r\n'auld Auntie Katie?'\r\n\r\n    'My auld Auntie Katie upon me takes pity;\r\n      I'll do my endeavor to follow her plan:\r\n    I'll cross him, and rack him, until I heart-break him,\r\n      And then his auld brass will buy me a new pan.'\r\n\r\nNo! She has willingly accepted a responsibility. It is her duty to bear\r\nit loyally, faithfully, uncomplainingly to the end.\r\n\r\nLet us sum up with the maxim, that the husband should be the senior, but\r\nthat the difference of age should not be more than ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT SHOULD BE HIS TEMPERAMENT?\r\n\r\nIt is often hard to make out what doctors mean by _temperaments_. It is\r\nsupposed that our mental and physical characters depend somehow on the\r\npredominance of some organ or system which controls the rest. Thus a\r\nperson who is nervous, quick, sensitive to impressions, is said to have\r\na _nervous_ temperament; one who is stout, full-blooded, red-faced, has\r\na _sanguine_ temperament; a thin, dark-featured, reticent person, is of\r\na _bilious_ temperament; while a pale, fat, sluggish nature, is called\r\n_phlegmatic_, or _lymphatic._\r\n\r\nIn a general way these distinctions are valuable, but they will not bear\r\nvery exact applications. They reveal in outline the constitution of mind\r\nand body; and what is to our present purpose, they are of more than\r\nusual importance in the question of selecting a husband.\r\n\r\nNature, hating incongruity, yet loves variety. She preserves the limits\r\nof species, but within those limits she seeks fidelity to one type.\r\nTherefore it is that in marriage a person inclines strongly to one of a\r\ndifferent temperament--to a person quite unlike himself.\r\n\r\nSo true is this, that a Frenchman of genius, Bernardin de St. Pierre,\r\nvouches for this anecdote of himself. He was in a strange city, visiting\r\na friend whom he had not seen for years. The friend's sister was of that\r\nage when women are most susceptible. She was tall, a blonde, deliberate\r\nin motion, with blue eyes and fair hair. In a jesting way, St. Pierre,\r\nwho had never seen her before, and knew nothing of her personal life,\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n'Mademoiselle, you have many admirers. Shall I describe him on whom you\r\nlook with most favor?'\r\n\r\nThe lady challenged him to do so.\r\n\r\n'He is short in stature, of dark complexion, dark hair and eyes, slight\r\nin figure, active and nervous in all his movements.'\r\n\r\nThe lady blushed to her eyes, and cast a glance of anger at her brother,\r\nwho, she thought, had betrayed her secret. But no! St. Pierre's only\r\ninformant was his deep knowledge of the human heart.\r\n\r\nThis instinct is founded upon the truth that the perfect temperament is\r\nthat happily balanced one which holds all the organs in equilibrium,--in\r\nwhich no one rules, where all are developed in proportion. Nature ever\r\nstrives to realize this ideal. She instills in the nervous temperament a\r\npreference for the lymphatic; in the sanguine, a liking for the bilious\r\nconstitution. The offspring should combine the excellencies of both, the\r\ndefects of neither. We do well to heed her admonitions here, and to bear\r\nin mind that those matches which combine opposite temperaments, are, as\r\na rule, the most fortunate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MORAL AND MENTAL CHARACTER.\r\n\r\nVery few words are necessary here. We have already said we speak as\r\nphysicians, not as moralists. But there are some false and dangerous\r\nideas abroad, which it is our duty as physicians to combat.\r\n\r\nNone is more false, none more dangerous, than that embodied in the\r\nproverb, 'A reformed rake makes the best husband.' What is a rake? A man\r\nwho has deceived and destroyed trusting virtue,--a man who has entered\r\nthe service of the devil to undermine and poison that happiness in\r\nmarriage, which all religion and science are at such pains to cultivate.\r\nWe know him well in our capacity as physicians. He comes to us\r\nconstantly the prey to loathsome diseases, the results of his vicious\r\nlife; which diseases he will communicate to his wife, for they are\r\ncontagious, and to his children, for they are hereditary; and which no\r\nreform can purge from his system, for they are ineradicable.\r\n\r\nIs this the man a pure woman should take to her arms? Here repentance\r\navails nothing. We have witnessed the agony unspeakable which\r\noverwhelmed a father when he saw his children suffering under horrible\r\nand disgusting diseases, the penalty of his early sins.\r\n\r\nVery few men of profligate lives escape these diseases. They are\r\nalarmingly prevalent among the 'fast' youths of our cities. And some\r\nforms of them are incurable by any effort of skill. Even the approach of\r\nsuch men should be shunned,--their company avoided.\r\n\r\nA physician in central Pennsylvania lately had this experience: A young\r\nlady of unblemished character asked his advice for a troublesome\r\naffection of the skin. He examined it, and to his horror recognised a\r\nform of one of the loathsome diseases which curse only the vilest or the\r\nmost unfortunate of her sex. Yet he could not suspect this girl. On\r\ninquiry, he found that she had a small but painful sore on her lip,\r\nwhich she first noticed a few days after being at a picnic with a young\r\nman. Just as he was bidding her good-night, he had kissed her on the\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nAt once everything was clear. This young man was a patient of the\r\nphysician. He was a victim to this vile disease, and even his kiss was\r\nenough to convey it.\r\n\r\nThe history of the sixteenth century contains the account of an Italian\r\nduke, who on one occasion was forced by his ruler to reconcile himself\r\nwith an enemy. Knowing he could not escape obedience, he protested the\r\nmost cheerful willingness, and in the presence of the king embraced his\r\nenemy, and even kissed him on the lips. It was but another means of\r\nsatisfying his hatred. For he well knew that his kiss would taint his\r\nenemy's blood with the same poison that was undermining his own life.\r\n\r\nHow cautious, therefore, should a woman be in granting the most innocent\r\nliberties! How solicitous should she be to associate with the purest\r\nmen!\r\n\r\nWould that we could say that these dangerous and loathsome diseases are\r\nrare! But, alas! daily professional experience forbids us to offer this\r\nconsolation. Every physician in our large cities, and even in smaller\r\ntowns, knows that they are fearfully prevalent.\r\n\r\nWe have been consulted by wives, pure, innocent women, for complaints\r\nwhich they themselves, and sometimes their children, suffered from, the\r\nnature of which we dared not tell them, but which pointed with fatal\r\nfinger to the unfaithfulness of the husband. How utterly was their\r\ndomestic happiness wrecked when they discovered the cause of their\r\nconstant ill-health!\r\n\r\nNor are such occurrences confined to the humbler walks of life. There,\r\nperhaps, less than in any other do they occur. It is in the wealthy, the\r\nluxurious, the self-indulgent class that they are found.\r\n\r\nAre we asked how such a dreadful fate can be averted?\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, certain signs and marks which such diseases leave\r\nwith which physicians are conversant. As if nature intended them as\r\nwarnings, they are imprinted on the most visible and public parts of the\r\nbody. The skin, the hair, the nose, the voice, the lines on the face,\r\noften divulge to the trained observer, more indubitably than the\r\nconfessional, a lewd and sensual life.\r\n\r\nSuch signs, however, can only be properly estimated by the medical\r\ncounselor, and it would be useless to rehearse them here. Those women\r\nwho would have a sure guide in choosing a man to be their husband, have\r\nthey not Moses and the prophets? What is more, have they not Christ and\r\nthe apostles? Rest assured that the man who scoffs at Christianity, who\r\nneglects its precepts and violates its laws, runs a terrible risk of\r\nbringing upon himself, his wife, and his children, the vengeance of\r\nnature, which knows justice but not mercy. Rest assured that the man who\r\nrespects the maxims of that religion, and abstains from all uncleanness,\r\nis the only man who is worthy the full and confiding love of an\r\nhonorable woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYMBOLISM OF THE HUMAN BODY.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers say that every idle word which is spoken continues to\r\nvibrate in the air through all infinity. So it is with the passions and\r\nthe thoughts. Each impresses on the body some indelible mark, and a long\r\ncontinuance of similar thoughts leaves a visible imprint.\r\n\r\nUnder the names of phrenology, physiognomy, palmistry, and others,\r\nattempts have been made at divers times to lay down fixed principles by\r\nwhich we could judge of men by their outsides; but only vague results\r\nhave been obtained. A learned German author, of high repute in exact\r\nscience, has gone a different way to work. He has studied the body as a\r\nwhole, and sought with the eye of an anatomist how different avocations,\r\npassions, temperaments, habits, mould and fashion the external parts of\r\nman. His results are embraced in a curious volume which he entitles _The\r\nSymbolism of the Human Body_. We shall borrow some hints from it,\r\ngermane to our present theme.\r\n\r\nAs to size, large-bodied and large-boned men possess greater energy, a\r\nmore masculine character, but often less persistence, and are usually\r\ndevoid of the more delicate emotions. Fat people are good-tempered, but\r\nindolent; thin people, full of life, but irascible.\r\n\r\nThe neck is a significant part of the body. View it from in front, and\r\nit discloses the physical constitution. There are the conduits of the\r\nfood and the air; there, the great blood-vessels pass to the head, and\r\nits base is modified by their form as they pass from the heart. When\r\nbroad and full, it denotes a vigorous physical life,--a plethoric\r\nconstitution. A distinguished teacher of midwifery, Professor Pajot of\r\nParis, says that when he sees one of those necks full in front, like\r\nthat of Marie Antoinette, as shown in her portraits, he prepares himself\r\nto combat childbed convulsions. That queen, it is well-known, nearly\r\nperished with them.\r\n\r\nThe back of the neck contains the vertebral column, and is close to the\r\nbrain. It reveals the mental constitution. The short round neck of the\r\nprize-fighter betrays his craft. The slender, arched, and graceful neck\r\nof the well-proportioned woman is the symbol of health and a\r\nwell-controlled mind. Burke, in his _Essay on the Beautiful_, calls it\r\nthe most beauteous object in nature. It is a common observation, that a\r\nsensual character is shown by the thick and coarse development of this\r\nportion of the body.\r\n\r\nThe hair, also, has a significance. Fine whitish hair, like that of a\r\nchild, goes with a simple, child-like disposition; black hair denotes a\r\ncertain hardness of character; red hair has long been supposed to be\r\nassociated with a sensual constitution, but it rather indicates a\r\nphysical weakness,--a tendency to scrofula. This is, however, a tendency\r\nmerely. Thin hair is often the result of protracted mental labor, though\r\nmany other causes produce it.\r\n\r\nEvery great man, says Herder, has a glance which no one can imitate. We\r\nmay go farther, and say that every man of decided character reveals it\r\nin his eyes. They are the most difficult organs for the hypocrite to\r\ncontrol. Beware of the man who cannot look you in the eyes, and of him\r\nin whose eyes there lurks an expression which allures yet makes you\r\nshudder. The one has something he dares not tell you, the other\r\nsomething you dare not listen to.\r\n\r\nSymmetry, strength, grace, health,--these are admirable qualities in a\r\nman. From the remotest ages they have been the marks of heroes.\r\nSecondary though they are to moral and mental qualities, they should be\r\never highly valued. A _manly_ man! Nature designs such to be the sires\r\nof future generations. No danger that we shall fall to worshiping\r\nphysical beauty again. The only fear is that in this lank, puny, scrawny\r\ngeneration of ours, we shall, out of vanity, underrate such beauty. Let\r\nit be ever remembered that this is the ideal, from which any departure\r\nis deterioration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGAGEMENT.\r\n\r\nWhen our grandmothers were engaged, the minister rose in his pulpit on\r\nSunday morning, before the assembled congregation, and proclaimed the\r\n'banns,' stating that if any one knew just cause or lawful impediment\r\nwhy the lovers should not be married, he should state it there and then.\r\nSometimes a great hubbub was created when some discarded suitor rose,\r\nforbidding the banns, and claimed that the capricious maiden had\r\npreviously promised herself to him. Perhaps it was to avoid such an\r\nuncomfortable check on the freedom of flirtation that the ancient custom\r\nwas dropped.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, that to be 'engaged' sits very lightly on the minds of\r\nboth young men and maidens now-a-days. We know some of either sex who\r\nmake it a boast how often they have made and unmade this slender tie. It\r\nis a dangerous pastime. 'The hand of little use hath the daintier\r\ntouch,' and they who thus trifle with their affections will end by\r\nlosing the capacity to feel any real affection at all.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly there occur instances where a woman has pledged herself in\r\nall seriousness, and afterwards sees her affianced in a light which\r\nwarns her that she cannot be happy with him,--that the vows she will be\r\ncalled upon to pronounce at the altar will be hollow and false. What is\r\nshe to do?\r\n\r\nWe are not inditing the decrees of the Court of Love. Here is the advice\r\nof another to her hand:\r\n\r\n        'First to thine own self be true,\r\n    And then it follows, as the night the day,\r\n    That thou canst ne'er be false to any man.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCERNING LONG ENGAGEMENTS.\r\n\r\nThey are hurtful, and they are unnecessary. Is love so vagrant that it\r\nmust be tied by such a chain? Better let it go. True love asks no oath;\r\nit casteth out fear, and believes without a promise.\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons, sound physiological reasons, which we could\r\nadduce, if need were, to show that the close personal relations which\r\narise between persons who are engaged should not be continued too long a\r\ntime. They lead to excitement and debility, sometimes to danger and\r\ndisease. Especially is this true of nervous, excitable, sympathetic\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\nIf we are asked to be definite, and give figures, we should say that a\r\nperiod not longer than a year, nor shorter than three months, should\r\nintervene between the engagement and the marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT TIME OF YEAR TO MARRY.\r\n\r\nWoman, when she marries, enters upon a new life, and a trying one. Every\r\nadvantage should be in her favour. The season is one of those\r\nadvantages. Extreme heat and extreme cold both wear severely on the\r\nhuman frame. Mid-winter and mid-summer are, therefore, alike\r\nobjectionable, especially the latter.\r\n\r\nSpring and fall are usually chosen, as statistics show, and the\r\npreference is just. On the whole, the spring is rather to be recommended\r\nthan the autumn. In case of a birth within the year, the child will have\r\nattained sufficient age to weather its period of teething more easily\r\nere the next summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT TIME IN THE MONTH TO MARRY.\r\n\r\nWe mean the woman's own month, that which spans the time between her\r\nperiodical sicknesses, be it two or five weeks. Let her choose a day\r\nabout equidistant from two periods. The reasons for this we shall\r\nspecify hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEDDING TOUR.\r\n\r\nCustom prescribes a journey immediately after marriage, of a week or a\r\nmonth or two. It is an unwise provision. The event itself is disturbance\r\nenough for the system; and to be hurried hither and thither, stowed in\r\nnarrow berths and inconvenient carriages, troubled with baggage, and\r\nannoyed by the importunities of cabmen, waiters, and hangers-on of every\r\ndescription, is enough, in ordinary times, to test the temper of a\r\nsaint.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of many an unhappy future is laid on the wedding tour.\r\nNot only is the young wife tried beyond all her experience, and her\r\nnervous system harassed, but the husband, too, partakes of her weakness.\r\nMany men, who really love the women they marry, are subject to a slight\r\nrevulsion of feeling for a few days after marriage. 'When the veil\r\nfalls, and the girdle is loosened,' says the German poet Schiller, 'the\r\nfair illusion vanishes.' A half regret crosses their minds for the jolly\r\nbachelorhood they have renounced. The mysterious charms which gave their\r\nloved one the air of something more than human, disappear in the prosaic\r\nsunlight of familiarity.\r\n\r\nLet neither be alarmed, nor lose their self-control. Each requires\r\nindulgence, and management, from the other; both should demand from\r\nthemselves patience and self-command. A few weeks, and this danger is\r\nover; but a mistake now is the mistake of a lifetime. More than one\r\nwoman has confessed to us that her unhappiness commenced from her\r\nwedding tour; and when we inquired more minutely, we have found that it\r\narose from an ignorance and disregard of just such little precautions as\r\nwe have been referring to.\r\n\r\nYet it is every way advisable that the young pair should escape the\r\nprying eyes of friends and relatives at such a moment. Let them choose\r\nsome quiet resort, not too long a journey from home, where they can\r\npass a few weeks in acquiring that more intimate knowledge of each\r\nother's character as essential to their future happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE WEDDING NIGHT._\r\n\r\nWe now enter upon the consideration of the second great period in the\r\nlife of Woman. The maiden becomes a Wife. She is born into a new world.\r\nShe assumes new relationships,--the sweetest, and, at the same time, the\r\nmost natural of which she is capable.\r\n\r\nThe great object of the conjugal union is the transmission of life,--a\r\nduty necessary in order to repair the constant ravages of death, and\r\nthus perpetuate the race. In the fulfilment of this sublime obligation,\r\nwoman plays the more prominent part, as she is the source and depositary\r\nof the future being. It is of moment, therefore, that she should not be\r\naltogether ignorant of the nature and responsibilities of her position.\r\nIgnorance here means suffering, disease, and sometimes death. Let us\r\nthen interrogate science in regard to these matters, among the most\r\ninteresting of all human concerns.\r\n\r\nThe initiation into marriage, like its full fruition, maternity, is\r\nattended with more or less suffering. Much, however, may be done to\r\navert and to lessen the pain which waits upon the first step in this new\r\nlife. For this purpose, regard must be had to the selection of the day.\r\nWe have said that a time about midway between the monthly recurring\r\nperiods is best fitted for the consummation of marriage. As this is a\r\nseason of sterility, it recommends itself on this account, in the\r\ninterest of both the mother and offspring. The first nuptial relations\r\nshould be fruitless, in order that the indispositions possibly arising\r\nfrom them shall have time to subside before the appearance of the\r\ndisturbances incident to pregnancy. One profound change should not too\r\nquickly succeed the other. About the tenth day after menstruation should\r\ntherefore be chosen for the marriage ceremony.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that marriage is consummated with difficulty. To\r\novercome this, care, management, and forbearance should always be\r\nemployed, and anything like precipitation and violence avoided. Only the\r\nconsequences of unrestrained impetuosity are to be feared. In those rare\r\ncases in which greater resistance is experienced than can be overcome by\r\ngentle means, the existence of a condition contrary to nature may be\r\nsuspected. Violence can then only be productive of injury, and is not\r\nwithout danger. Medical art should be appealed to, as it alone can\r\nafford assistance in such an emergency.\r\n\r\nAlthough the first conjugal approaches are ordinarily accompanied by\r\nslight flooding, a loss of blood does not always occur. Its absence\r\nproves nothing. The appearance of blood was formerly regarded as a test\r\nof virginity. The Israelites, Arabs, and others carefully preserved and\r\ntriumphantly exhibited the evidence of it as an infallible sign of the\r\nvirtue of the bride. They were in error. Its presence is as destitute of\r\nsignification as its absence; for it is now well known that widows, and\r\nwives long separated from their husbands, often have a like experience.\r\nThe temperament is not without its influence. In those of lymphatic\r\ntemperament, pale blondes, who often suffer from local discharge and\r\nweakness, the parts being relaxed, there is less pain and little or no\r\nhæmorrhage. In brunettes, who have never had any such troubles, the case\r\nis reversed. The use of baths, unguents, etc., by the young wife,\r\nhowever serviceable they might prove, is obviously impracticable. This\r\ngreat change sometimes also produces swelling and inflammation of the\r\nglands of the neck.\r\n\r\nMarital relations ordinarily continue during the first few weeks to be\r\nmore or less painful. General constitutional disturbance and disorders\r\nof the nervous system often result. These troubles are all increased by\r\nthe stupid custom of hurrying the bride from place to place, at a time\r\nwhen the bodily quiet and the mental calmness and serenity so desirable\r\nto her should be the only objects in view. Too frequent indulgence at\r\nthis period is a fruitful source of various inflammatory diseases, and\r\noften occasions temporary sterility and ill-health. The old custom\r\nrequiring a three days' separation after the first nuptial approach was\r\na wise one, securing to the young wife the soothing and restoring\r\ninfluence of rest. Nothing was lost by it, and much gained.\r\n\r\nIn a little while, however, all irritation should subside, and no\r\nsuffering or distress of any kind, whether general or local, should\r\nattend upon the performance of this important function. The presence of\r\nsuffering now becomes indicative of disease. Of this we will speak\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHALL HUSBAND AND WIFE OCCUPY THE SAME ROOM AND BED?\r\n\r\nOne-third of life is passed in sleep. This period of unconsciousness and\r\nrest is necessary for the renewal of vital strength, and upon its proper\r\nmanagement depends much of the health not merely of the husband and\r\nwife, but of their offspring. A great deal has been written upon the\r\neffect on health and happiness of occupying separate apartments,\r\nseparate beds in the same apartment, or the same bed. This vexed\r\nquestion it is impossible to settle by absolute rules, suitable to all\r\ncases. In general, it may be asserted that there are no valid\r\nphysiological reasons for desiring to change the custom which now\r\nprevails in this and most other countries. When both parties are in good\r\nhealth, and of nearly the same age, one bed-chamber, if sufficiently\r\nroomy, may be used without any disadvantage to either. Such an\r\narrangement is also to be commended, because it secures closer\r\ncompanionship, and thus developes and sustains mutual affection.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in Zurich, in the olden time, when a quarrelsome couple\r\napplied for a divorce, the magistrate refused to listen to them at\r\nfirst. He ordered that they should be shut up together in one room for\r\nthree days, with one bed, one table, one plate, and one cup. Their food\r\nwas passed in by attendants, who neither saw nor spoke to them. On the\r\nexpiration of the three days, it was usual to find that neither of them\r\nwanted a separation.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, there are conditions under which sleeping together is\r\nprejudicial to the health. A certain amount of fresh air during the\r\nnight is required by every one. Re-breathed air is poisonous. During\r\nsleep constant exhalations take place from the lungs and from the skin,\r\nwhich are injurious if absorbed. A room twelve feet square is too small\r\nfor two persons, unless it is so thoroughly ventilated that there is a\r\nconstant change of air. In fact, a sleeping apartment for two persons\r\nshould contain an air-space of at least twenty-four hundred cubic feet,\r\nand the facilities for ventilation should be such that the whole amount\r\nwill be changed in an hour,--that is, at the rate of forty cubic feet\r\nper minute; for it has been ascertained that twenty cubic feet of fresh\r\nair a minute are required for every healthy adult.\r\n\r\nVery young and very old people should never occupy the same bed. When\r\nthe married couple hold the relation to each other, in regard to age, of\r\ngrandfather and granddaughter, separate apartments should be insisted\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nCertain diseases can be produced by sleeping together. The bed of a\r\nconsumptive, it is well known, is a powerful source of contagion. In\r\nItaly it is the custom, after death, to destroy the bed-clothes of\r\nconsumptive patients. Tubercular disease has, within the past few years,\r\nbeen transferred from men to animals by inoculation. Authentic cases are\r\nupon record of young robust girls of healthy parentage, marrying men\r\naffected with consumption, acquiring the disease in a short time, and\r\ndying, in some instances, before their husbands. In these significant\r\ncases, the sickly emanations have apparently been communicated during\r\nsleep. When, therefore, either husband or wife is known to have\r\nconsumption, it would be highly imprudent for them to pass the long\r\nhours of the night either in the same bed or in the same room.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT KIND OF BED IS MOST HEALTHFUL?\r\n\r\nFeather-beds are not conducive to the health of either sex. Mattresses\r\nmade of wool, or of wool and horsehair, are much better. The bed should\r\nbe opened, and its contents exposed to the air and sunlight, once every\r\nyear. Beds long saturated with the night exhalations of their occupants\r\nare not wholesome. A number of ancient writers have alleged--and it has\r\nbeen reasserted by modern authorities--that sleeping on sponge is of\r\nservice to those who desire to increase their families. The mattresses\r\nof compressed sponge recently introduced, therefore, commend themselves\r\nto married people thus situated. Hemlock boughs make a bed which has a\r\nwell-established reputation for similar virtues.\r\n\r\nThe odor of cone-bearing trees has a well-known influence upon the\r\nfruitfulness of wedlock. Those who live in pine forests have ordinarily\r\nlarge families of children.\r\n\r\nExcessive clothing at night is highly injurious. So also is a fire in\r\nthe bed-room, except in case of sickness. If the body be too much heated\r\nduring sleep, perspiration occurs, or the action of the heart is\r\nincreased, and the whole economy becomes excited. Either condition\r\nprevents sound sleep and reinvigoration of the body. Wives in feeble\r\nhealth, and those liable to attacks of flooding, should therefore have a\r\nparticular regard to the quantity of clothing on their beds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIGNITY AND PROPRIETY OF THE SEXUAL INSTINCT.\r\n\r\nA distinguished medical writer has divided women into three classes in\r\nregard to the intensity of the sexual instinct. He asserts that a larger\r\nnumber than is generally supposed have little or no sexual feeling. A\r\nsecond class of women, more numerous than these, but still small as\r\ncompared with the whole of their sex, are more or less subject to strong\r\npassion. Those of the first class can no more form an idea of the\r\nstrength of the impulse in other women, than the blind can of colors.\r\nThey therefore often err in their judgments. The third class comprises\r\nthe vast majority of women, in whom the sexual appetite is as moderate\r\nas all other appetites.\r\n\r\nIt is a false notion, and contrary to nature, that this passion in a\r\nwoman is a derogation to her sex. The science of physiology indicates\r\nmost clearly its propriety and dignity. There are wives who plume\r\nthemselves on their repugnance or their distaste for their conjugal\r\nobligations. They speak of their coldness and of the calmness of their\r\nsenses, as if these were not defects. Excepting those afflicted with\r\nvices of conformation, or with disorders of sensibility,--which amount\r\nto the same thing,--all wives are called upon to receive and pay the\r\nimposts of love; and those who can withdraw themselves from the\r\noperation of this mysterious law without suffering and with\r\nsatisfaction, show themselves by that fact to be incomplete in their\r\norganization, and deficient in the special function of their being.\r\nThere should be no passion for one which is not shared by both.\r\nGeneration is a duty. The feeling which excites to the preservation of\r\nthe species is as proper as that which induces the preservation of the\r\nindividual. Passionate, exclusive, and durable love for a particular\r\nindividual of the opposite sex, it has been well said, is characteristic\r\nof the human race, and is a mark of distinction from other animals. The\r\ninstinct of reproduction in mankind is thus joined to an affectionate\r\nsentiment, which adds to its sweetness and prolongs infinitely its\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nMany physiologists have assigned to the feelings an important _rôle_ in\r\nconception, the possibility of which has even been doubted if there be\r\nno passion on the side of the woman. Although this extreme view is not\r\ntenable in the light of modern research, yet all recent authorities\r\nagree that conception is more assured when the two individuals who\r\nco-operate in it participate at the same time in the transports of which\r\nit is the fruit. It is also without doubt true that the disposition of\r\nthe woman at that time has much power in the formation of the foetus,\r\nboth in modifying its physical constitution and in determining the\r\ncharacter and temperament of its mind. The influence, long ago\r\nattributed by Shakspeare to 'a dull, stale, tired bed' in creating a\r\n'tribe of fops,' is not a mere poet's fancy.\r\n\r\nIn this manner also may be explained the results of prolonged continence\r\nupon the offspring, for desires are usually vivid in proportion to the\r\nprevious period of rest. The father of Montaigne, returning after an\r\nabsence of thirty-two years, during which he was engaged in the wars of\r\nItaly, begot his son, so justly celebrated in French literature. The\r\nfather of J. J. Rousseau, after a considerable absence in\r\nConstantinople, brought to his wife the reward of a long fidelity.\r\n\r\nSexual passion exerts, therefore, a marked influence upon the future\r\nbeing before conception, by the impression made upon the elements which\r\ncome together to form it. The question now occurs; What effect does its\r\npresence and gratification produce upon the parents? We answer; It is a\r\nnatural and healthful impulse. Its influence is salutary. A marked\r\nimprovement in the physical condition of delicate women often follows a\r\nhappy marriage. This sometimes occurs even in those cases where, from\r\nthe nature of the disorder, the reverse might be expected. The utility\r\nof the passions, well directed, has become a maxim in medicine as in\r\nmorality. And what passion is more important and fervent than that of\r\nwhich we write? The fathers in medicine, and their modern followers,\r\nagree in ascribing to the pleasures of love, indulged in with\r\nmoderation, activity and lightness of the body, vigor and vivacity of\r\nthe mind.\r\n\r\nMusic, apart from its immense influence on the nervous system in\r\ngeneral, seems sometimes to exercise a special action on the sexual\r\ninstinct. Science possesses at the present day some facts beyond\r\ndispute, which prove the great power of music in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE INDULGENCE AND THE RESTRAINT OF SEXUAL DESIRE.\r\n\r\nThe act of generation is a voluntary one. But nature has so placed it\r\nunder the empire of pleasure, that the voice of discretion is no longer\r\nheard, and the will is often led captive. Hence it is well, for hygienic\r\nreasons, to consider its laws.\r\n\r\nThe too frequent repetition of the reproductive act is known to be\r\nfollowed by consequences injurious to the general health. Too rigid\r\ncontinence is not unattended, in many constitutions, with danger, for\r\nthe victory over passion may be dearly bought. Science recommends the\r\nadoption of a wise mean between two extremes equally destructive. By\r\nfollowing her counsel, women may escape from the hysterical and other\r\ndisorders which often wait as well upon excess as upon too great denial\r\nof that passion, which claims satisfaction as a natural right.\r\n\r\nAs men have made laws upon all subjects, we need not be surprised to\r\nlearn that they have legislated upon this. History informs us that the\r\nlegislators of ancient times have not failed to occupy themselves with\r\nthis grave question of conjugal economy. The ordinances of Solon\r\nrequired that the married should acquit themselves of their duties at\r\nleast three times a month; those of Zoroaster prescribed once a week.\r\nMohammed ordered that any wife neglected by her husband longer than a\r\nweek could demand and obtain a divorce. It is not, however, in these,\r\nand other enactments which might be quoted, that guidance is to be\r\nsought. The principles derived from nature and experience are more\r\nvaluable than human laws, however venerable; for these too often serve\r\nonly to reflect the profound ignorance of their makers.\r\n\r\nModeration should here prevail. Health is thus preserved and\r\nstrengthened, and the gratification doubled. The art of seasoning\r\npleasures in general, consists in being avaricious with them. To abstain\r\nfrom enjoyment, is the philosophy of the sage, the epicurism of reason.\r\n\r\nProper self-denial in the gratification of the wants of physical love is\r\na source of good, not only to the individual practising it, but to the\r\ncommunity, as we shall show hereafter. It may be observed for one's own\r\nprofit only, or for the benefit of another. The latter is in the end\r\nmore conducive to self-interest than the former. A double advantage is\r\nderived therefrom,--gratitude and sympathy returned, and increase of\r\nappetite and of power for future enjoyment. Excess of indulgence results\r\nin the pain of surfeit and the extinction of affection. Earnest love,\r\nsatisfying itself with small gratifications, is a more copious source of\r\nhappiness than that frequently quenched by full gratification.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is this moderation which both Hygeia and Venus command?\r\nHere, again, invariable rules are not possible. Science rarely lays down\r\nlaws so inflexible as those of the Medes and Persians. She designates\r\nlimits. The passage between Scylla and Charybdis is often a wide one.\r\nThe folly of the ancient statutes which have been referred to, consists\r\nmainly in their failure to recognise the diverse influence of age,\r\ntemperament, seasons, etc.\r\n\r\nIt almost appears as if there were but one _season_ for generation, that\r\nin which the sun re-warms and vivifies the earth, trees dress in\r\nverdure, and animals respire the soft breath of spring. Then every\r\nliving thing reanimates itself. The impulse of reproduction is excited.\r\nNow, also, its gratification is most beneficial to the individual and to\r\nthe species. Children conceived in the spring time have greater\r\nvitality, are less apt to die during infancy, than those conceived at\r\nany other time of the year. The statistics of many thousand cases,\r\nrecently carefully collated in England, prove this beyond peradventure.\r\nIt is well known that a late calf, or one born at the end of the summer,\r\nis not likely to become a well-developed and healthy animal. This has\r\nbeen attributed to the chilling influence of approaching winter; but it\r\nis capable of another and, perhaps, a truer explanation. Nature's\r\nimpulses, therefore, in the spring of the year are for the good of the\r\nrace, and may then be more frequently indulged without prejudice to the\r\nindividual. Summer is the season which agrees the least with the\r\nexercise of the generative functions. The autumn months are the most\r\nunfruitful. Then, also, derangements of the economy are readily excited\r\nby marital intemperance.\r\n\r\nThe _temperaments_ exert over reproduction, as over all the other\r\nfunctions of the body, a powerful influence. Love is said to be the\r\nruling passion in the sanguine temperament, as ambition is in the\r\nbilious. There is also in some cases a peculiar condition of the nervous\r\nsystem which impels to, or diverts from, sexual indulgence. In some\r\nwomen, even in moderation, it acts as a poison, being followed by\r\nheadache and prostration, lasting for days.\r\n\r\nWith advancing years, the fading of sexual desire calls attention to the\r\ngeneral law, that animals and plants, when they become old, are dead to\r\nreproduction. What in early life is followed by temporary languor, in\r\nmatured years is succeeded by a train of symptoms much graver and more\r\ndurable.\r\n\r\nThose who are in feeble health, and particularly those who have delicate\r\nchests, ought to be sober in the gratification of love. Sexual\r\nintercourse has proved mortal after severe hæmorrhages.\r\n\r\nAll organized beings are powerfully affected by propagation. Animals\r\nbecome depressed and dejected after it. The flower which shines so\r\nbrilliantly at the moment of its amours, after the consummation of that\r\nact, withers and falls. It is wise, therefore, in imparting life, to\r\nhave a care not to shorten one's own existence. Nothing is more certain\r\nthan that animals and plants lessen the duration of their lives by\r\nmultiplied sexual enjoyments. The abuse of these pleasures produces\r\nlassitude and weakness. Beauty of feature and grace of movement are\r\nsacrificed. When the excess is long continued, it occasions spasmodic\r\nand convulsive affections, enfeeblement of the senses, particularly that\r\nof sight, deprivation of the mental functions, loss of memory,\r\npulmonary consumption and death. One of the most eminent of living\r\nphysiologists has asserted that 'development of the individual and the\r\nreproduction of the species stand in a reverse ratio to each other,' and\r\nthat 'the highest degree of bodily rigor is inconsistent with more than\r\na very modest indulgence in sexual intercourse.'\r\n\r\nThe general principles we have just enunciated are of great importance\r\nin the regulation of the health. They are more suggestive and useful\r\nthan the precise rules which have from time to time been laid down on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIMES WHEN MARITAL RELATIONS SHOULD BE SUSPENDED.\r\n\r\nThere are times at which marital relations are eminently improper. We\r\nare told, I Cor. vii. 3, 4, that neither husband nor wife has the power\r\nto refuse the conjugal obligation when the debt is demanded. But there\r\nare certain legitimate causes for denial by the wife.\r\n\r\nA condition of intoxication in the husband is a proper ground for\r\nrefusal. Fecundation taking place while either parent has been in this\r\nstate has produced idiots and epileptics. This has happened again and\r\nagain. The cases on record are so numerous and well-authenticated, as to\r\nadmit of no doubt in regard to the fatal effect upon the mind of the\r\noffspring of conception under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nPhysical degeneracy is also often a consequence of procreation during\r\nthe alcoholic intoxication of one or both parents. A peculiar arrest of\r\ngrowth and development of body and mind takes place, and, in some\r\ninstances, the unfortunate children, although living to years of\r\nmanhood, remain permanent infants, just able to stand by the side of a\r\nchair, to utter a few simple sounds, and to be amused with childish\r\ntoys.\r\n\r\nDuring convalescence from a severe sickness, or when there is any local\r\nor constitutional disease which would be aggravated by sexual\r\nintercourse, it should be abstained from. There is reason for believing\r\nthat a being procreated at a period of ill-humour, bodily indisposition,\r\nor nervous debility, may carry with it, during its whole existence, some\r\nsmall particles of these evils. When there exists any contagious\r\ndisease, refusals are of course valid, and often a duty to the unborn.\r\nPoverty, or the wish to have no more children, can only be exceptionally\r\nallowed as a reason for the denial of all conjugal privileges.\r\n\r\nThe opinion that sexual relations practised during the time of the\r\nmenses engender children liable to scrofulous disease, is a mere popular\r\nprejudice. But there are other and better-founded reasons for continence\r\nduring these periods.\r\n\r\nThe question of intercourse during pregnancy and suckling will come up\r\nfor consideration when speaking of these conditions hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS WHEN MARITAL RELATIONS ARE PAINFUL.\r\n\r\nNature has not designed that a function of great moment to the human\r\nrace--one involving its very existence--should be attended with pain.\r\nThe presence of pleasure is indicative of health, its absence of\r\ndisease. But to a woman who has systematically displaced her womb by\r\nyears of imprudence in conduct or dress, this act, which should be a\r\nphysiological one, and free from any hurtful tendencies becomes a source\r\nof distress and even of illness. The diseases of the womb which\r\nsometimes follow matrimony are not to be traced to excessive indulgence\r\nin many cases, but to indulgence _to any extent_ by those who have\r\naltered the natural relation of the parts before marriage. A prominent\r\nphysician, Prof. T. Gaillard Thomas, of New York, has said that 'upon a\r\nwoman who has enfeebled her system by habits of indulgence and luxury,\r\npressed her uterus entirely out of its normal place, and who perhaps\r\ncomes to the nuptial bed with some marked uterine disorder, the result\r\nof imprudence at menstrual epochs, sexual intercourse has a _poisonous_\r\ninfluence. The taking of food into the stomach exerts no hurtful\r\ninfluence on the digestive system; but the taking of food by a\r\ndyspeptic, who has abused and injured that organ, does so.'\r\n\r\nWhen excessive pain exists, and every attempt occasions nervous\r\ntrepidation and apprehension, it is absolutely certain that there is\r\nsome diseased condition present, for which proper advice should be\r\nsecured at once. Delay in doing so will not remove the necessity for\r\nmedical interference in the end, while it will assuredly aggravate the\r\ntrouble. Prompt intelligent aid, on the contrary, is usually followed by\r\nthe happiest results in such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTERILITY.\r\n\r\nWives who never become mothers are said to be sterile or barren. This\r\ncondition is frequently a cause of much unhappiness. Fortune may favor\r\nthe married couple in every other respect, yet if she refuse to accord\r\nthe boon of even a single heir to heart and home, her smiles will bear\r\nthe aspect of frowns. It is then of some interest to inquire into the\r\ncauses of this condition, and how to prevent or remedy their operation.\r\n\r\nDr. Duncan, of Edinburgh, has shown, by elaborate research, that in\r\nthose wives who are destined to have children, there intervenes, on the\r\naverage, about seventeen months between the marriage ceremony and the\r\nbirth of the first child, and that the question whether a woman will be\r\nsterile is decided in the first three years of married life. If she have\r\nno children in that time, the chances are thirteen to one against her\r\never having any. In those cases, therefore, in which the first three\r\nyears of married life are fruitless, it is highly desirable for those\r\nwishing a family to ascertain whether or not the barrenness is dependent\r\nupon any defective condition capable of relief.\r\n\r\nThe age of a wife at the time of marriage has much to do with the\r\nexpectation of children. As the age increases over twenty-five years,\r\nthe interval between the marriage and the birth of the first child is\r\nlengthened. For it has been ascertained that not only are women most\r\nfecund from twenty to twenty-four, but that they begin their career of\r\nchild-bearing sooner after marriage than their younger or elder sisters.\r\nEarly marriages (those before the age of twenty) are sometimes more\r\nfruitful than late ones (those after twenty-four). The interesting\r\nresult has further been arrived at in England, that about one in\r\nfourteen of all marriages of women between fifteen and nineteen are\r\nwithout offspring; that wives married at ages from twenty to twenty-four\r\ninclusive, are almost all fertile; and that after that age the chances\r\nof having no children gradually increases with the greater age at the\r\ntime of marriage.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of sterility which are physiological, natural to all\r\nwomen,--that of young girls before puberty, and that of women who are\r\npast the epoch of the cessation of the menses. In some very rare cases,\r\nconception takes place after cessation. In one published case, it\r\noccurred nine months afterwards, and in another eighteen months. In some\r\nvery rare cases, also, conception has taken place before the first\r\nmenstruation.\r\n\r\nThe older a woman is at the time of her marriage, the longer deferred is\r\nthe age at which she naturally becomes sterile. She bears children later\r\nin life, in order to compensate, as it were, for her late commencement.\r\nBut although she continues to have children until a more advanced age\r\nthan the earlier married, yet her actual child-bearing period is\r\nshorter. Nature does not entirely make up at the end of life for the\r\ntime lost from the duties of maternity in early womanhood; for the\r\nyounger married have really a longer era of fertility than the older,\r\nthough it terminates at an earlier age.\r\n\r\nA wife who, having had children, has ceased for three years to conceive,\r\nwill probably bear no more, and the probability increases as time\r\nelapses. After the first, births take place with an average interval, in\r\nthose who continue to be fertile, of about twenty months.\r\n\r\nNursing women are generally sterile, above all, during the first months\r\nwhich follow accouchement, because the vital forces are then\r\nconcentrated on the secretion of the milk. In a majority of instances,\r\nwhen suckling is prolonged to even nineteen or twenty months, pregnancy\r\ndoes not take place at all until after weaning.\r\n\r\nClimate has also an influence upon the fertility of marriages. In\r\nsouthern regions more children are born, fewer in northern. The number\r\nof children is in inverse proportion to the amount of food in a country\r\nand in a season. In Belgium, the higher the price of bread the greater\r\nthe number of children, and the greater the number of infant deaths.\r\n\r\nThe seasons exert a power over the increase of population. The spring of\r\nthe year, as has already been stated, is the most favourable to\r\nfecundity. It is not known whether day and night have any effect upon\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nThe worldly condition seems to have much to do with the size of a\r\nfamily. Rich and fashionable women have fewer children than their poor\r\nand hard-worked neighbours. Wealth and pleasure seem to be often gladly\r\nexchanged for the title of mother.\r\n\r\nBut it is our more particular object now to inquire into the _causes of\r\nabsolute sterility_ in individual cases, rather than to discuss the\r\noperation of general laws upon the fertility of the community at large,\r\nhowever inviting such a discussion may be. When marriages are fruitless,\r\nthe wife is almost always blamed. It is not to be supposed that she is\r\nalways in fault. Many husbands are absolutely sterile; for it is a\r\nmistake to consider that every man must be prolific who is vigorous and\r\nenjoys good health. Neither does it follow, because a woman has never\r\ngiven birth to a living child, that she has not conceived. About one\r\nmarriage in eight is unproductive of living children, and therefore\r\nfails to add to the population. The seeds of life have, however, been\r\nmore extensively sown among women than these figures would seem to\r\nindicate. If the life of an infant for a long time after birth is a\r\nfrail one, before birth its existence is precarious in the extreme. It\r\noften perishes soon after conception. A sickness, unusually long and\r\nprofuse, occurring in a young married woman a few days beyond the\r\nregular time, is often the only evidence she will ever have that a life\r\nshe has communicated has been ended almost as soon as begun. A tendency\r\nto miscarriage may therefore be all that stands in the way of a family.\r\nThis is generally remediable.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that frigidity is a frequent cause of\r\nbarrenness, as well as a barrier to matrimonial happiness. Its removal,\r\nso desirable, is in many cases possible by detecting and doing away with\r\nthe cause. The causes are so various, that their enumeration here would\r\nbe tedious and unprofitable, for most of them can only be discovered\r\nand remedied by a practical physician who has studied the particular\r\ncase under consideration. So also in regard to the various displacements\r\nand diseases of the womb preventing conception. Proper medical treatment\r\nis usually followed by the best results.\r\n\r\nWhile the fact that pleasure is found in the marital relation is a\r\nfavourable augury for impregnation, it has been long noticed that\r\nMessalinas are sterile. It was observed in Paris, that out of one\r\nthousand only six bore children in the course of a year, whereas the\r\nordinary proportion in that city for that time is three and a half\r\nbirths for every one hundred of the population.\r\n\r\nIn some women, nothing seems amiss but too intense passion. Such cases\r\nare much more rare than instances of the opposite extreme producing the\r\nsame effect.\r\n\r\nA condition of debility, or the presence of certain special poisons in\r\nthe blood, may prevent conception, or, what is to all intents the same\r\nthing, cause miscarriage. Many apparently feeble women have large\r\nfamilies. But in numerous instances a tonic and sometimes an alternative\r\nconstitutional treatment is required before pregnancy will take place.\r\nOn the contrary, there are well-authenticated cases of women who were\r\nstout and barren in opulence becoming thin and prolific in poverty.\r\n\r\nThe stimulus of novelty to matrimonial intercourse imparted by a short\r\nseparation of husband and wife, is often salutary in its influence upon\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nTo show upon what slight constitutional differences infertility often\r\ndepends, it is merely necessary to allude to the fact, known to every\r\none, that women who have not had children with one husband often have\r\nthem with another. This condition of physiological incompatibility is\r\nevidently not altogether one of the emotional nature, for it is observed\r\nin animals, among whom it is by no means rare to find certain males and\r\nfemales who will not breed together, although both are known to be\r\nperfectly fruitful with other females and males. The ancients, believing\r\nthat sterility was more common with couples of the same temperament and\r\ncondition, advised, with Hippocrates, that blonde women should unite\r\nwith dark men, thin women with stout men, and _vice versâ._\r\n\r\nBarren women should not despair. They sometimes become fecund after a\r\nlong lapse of years. In other words, they are sterile only during a\r\ncertain period of their lives, and then, a change occurring in their\r\ntemperament with age, they become fruitful. History affords a striking\r\nexample of this eccentricity of generation, in the birth of Louis XIV.,\r\nwhom Anne of Austria, Queen of France brought into the world after a\r\nsterility of twenty-two years. Catherine de Medicis, wife of Henry II.,\r\nbecame the mother of ten children after a sterility of ten years. Dr.\r\nTilt, of London, mentions the case of a woman who was married at\r\neighteen, but although both herself and her husband enjoyed habitual\r\ngood health, conception did not take place until she was forty-eight,\r\nwhen she bore a child. Another case is reported where a well-formed\r\nfemale married at nineteen, and did not bear a child until she had\r\nreached her fiftieth year.\r\n\r\nFamilies often suffer from the effects of sterility. Civilised nations\r\nnever do. Recent researches have been carefully instituted in several\r\ncountries to determine the exact power of the human race to preserve its\r\nnumbers against the ravages of death. It has been ascertained that\r\nduring periods of peace the population can be maintained to the same\r\npoint by the additions made to it through the procreating capacity of\r\nonly one-half of the women in the community. Nature, therefore, has made\r\nample provision for preventing a decrease of population through failure\r\nof reproduction.\r\n\r\nShe has also instituted laws to prevent its undue increase. It would\r\nseem as if the extension of material mental and social comfort and\r\nculture has a tendency to render marriage less prolific, and population\r\nstationary or nearly so. So evident is this tendency, that it has been\r\nlaid down as a maxim in sociology by Sismondi, that 'where the number of\r\nmarriages is proportionally the greatest, where the greatest number of\r\npersons participate in the duties and the virtues and the happiness of\r\nmarriage, the smaller number of children does each marriage produce.'\r\nThus, to a certain extent, does nature endorse the opinions of those\r\npolitical economists who assert that increase of population beyond\r\ncertain limits is an evil happily averted by wars, famines, and\r\npestilences, which hence become national blessings in disguise. She,\r\nhowever, points to the extension of mental and moral education and\r\nrefinement as gentler and surer means of reducing plethoric population\r\nthan those suggested by Malthus and Mill.\r\n\r\nMany causes of sterility, it will therefore be seen, are beyond the\r\npower of man to control. They operate on a large scale for the good of\r\nthe whole. With these we have little concern. But there are others which\r\nmay be influenced by intelligent endeavor. Some have been already\r\nalluded to, and the remedy suggested; but we will proceed to give more\r\nspecific\r\n\r\n\r\nADVICE TO WIVES WHO DESIRE TO HAVE CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that menstruation presents a group of phenomena\r\nclosely allied to fecundity. The first eruption of the menses is an\r\nunequivocal sign of the awakening of the faculty of reproduction. The\r\ncessation of the menstrual epochs is a sign equally certain of the loss\r\nof the faculty of reproduction. When conception has taken place, the\r\nperiodical flow is interrupted. Labor occurs at about the time in which\r\nthe menses would have appeared. In short, it is a fact, now completely\r\nestablished, that the time immediately before, and particularly that\r\nafter the monthly sickness, is the period the most favorable to\r\nfecundation. It is said that, by following the counsel to this effect\r\ngiven him by the celebrated Fernel, Henry II., the King of France,\r\nsecured to himself offspring after the long sterility of his wife before\r\nreferred to. Professor Bedford, of New York, says that he can point to\r\nmore than one instance in which, by this advice, he has succeeded in\r\nadding to the happiness of parties who for years had been vainly hoping\r\nfor the accomplishment of their wishes.\r\n\r\nRepose of the woman, and, above all, sojourn on the bed after the act of\r\ngeneration, also facilitates conception. Hippocrates, the great father\r\nof medicine, was aware of this, and laid stress upon it in his advice to\r\nsterile wives.\r\n\r\nThe womb and the breasts are bound together by very strong sympathies:\r\nthat which excites the one will stimulate the other. Dr. Charles Loudon\r\nmentions that four out of seven patients, by acting on this hint, became\r\nmothers. A similar idea occurred to the illustrious Marshall Hall, who\r\nadvised the application of a strong infant to the breast. Fomentations\r\nof warm milk to the breasts and the corresponding portion of the spinal\r\ncolumn, and the use of the breast-pump two or three times a day, just\r\nbefore the menstrual period, have also been recommended by good medical\r\nauthorities. Horseback exercise, carried to fatigue, seems occasionally\r\nto have conduced to pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe greatest hope of success against sterility is to change the dominant\r\nstate of the constitution. But this can only be effected under suitable\r\nmedical advice. The treatment of sterility--thanks to the recent\r\nresearches of Dr. Marion Sims--is much more certain than formerly; and\r\nthe intelligent physician is now able to ascertain the cause, and point\r\nout the remedy, where before all was conjecture and experiment. The\r\nsterile wife should, herefore, be slow in abandoning all hope of ever\r\nbecoming a mother.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE LIMITATION OF OFFSPRING.\r\n\r\nNo part of our subject is more delicate than this. Very few people are\r\nwilling to listen to a dispassionate discussion of the propriety or\r\nimpropriety of limiting within certain bounds the number of children in\r\na family. On the one side are many worthy physicians and pious\r\nclergymen, who, without listening to any arguments, condemn every effort\r\nto avoid large families; on the other, are numberless wives and\r\nhusbands, who turn a deaf ear to the warnings of doctors and the\r\nthunders of divines, and, eager to escape a responsibility they have\r\nassumed, hesitate not to resort to the most dangerous and immoral means\r\nto accomplish this end.\r\n\r\nWe ask both parties to lay aside prejudice and prepossession, and\r\nexamine with us this most important social question in all its bearings.\r\n\r\nLet us first inquire whether there is such a thing as\r\n_over-production_--having _too many_ children. Unquestionably there is.\r\nIts disastrous effects on both mother and children are known to every\r\nintelligent physician. Two-thirds of all cases of womb disease, says Dr.\r\nTilt, are traceable to child-bearing in feeble women. Hardly a day\r\npasses that a physician in large practice does not see instances of\r\ndebility and disease resulting from over-much child-bearing. Even the\r\nlower animals illustrate this. Every farmer is aware of the necessity of\r\nlimiting the offspring of his mares and cows. How much more severe are\r\nthe injuries inflicted on the delicate organization of woman! A very\r\ngreat mortality, says Dr. Duncan of Edinburgh, attends upon\r\nconfinements when they become too frequent.\r\n\r\nThe evils of a too rapid succession of pregnancies are likewise\r\nconspicuous in the children. There is no more frequent cause, says Dr.\r\nHillier,--whose authority in such matters none will dispute,--of rickets\r\nthan this. Puny, sickly, short-lived offspring follows over-production.\r\nWorse than this, the carefully compiled statistics of Scotland show that\r\nsuch children are peculiarly liable to idiocy. Adding to an already\r\nexcessive number, they come to over-burden a mother already overwhelmed\r\nwith progeny. They cannot receive at her hands the attention they\r\nrequire. Weakly herself, she brings forth weakly infants. 'Thus,'\r\nconcludes Dr. Duncan, 'are the accumulated evils of an excessive family\r\nmanifest.'\r\n\r\nApart from these considerations, there are certain social relations\r\nwhich have been thought by some to advise small families. When either\r\nparent suffers from a disease which is transmissible, and wishes to\r\navoid inflicting misery on an unborn generation, it has been urged that\r\nthey should avoid children. Such diseases not unfrequently manifest\r\nthemselves after marriage, which is answer enough to the objection that\r\nif they did not wish children they should not marry. There are also\r\nwomen to whom pregnancy is a nine months' torture, and others to whom it\r\nis nearly certain to prove fatal. Such a condition cannot be discovered\r\nbefore marriage, and therefore cannot be provided against by a single\r\nlife. Can such women be asked to immolate themselves?\r\n\r\nIt is strange, says that distinguished writer, John Stuart Mill, that\r\nintemperance in drink, or in any other appetite, should be condemned so\r\nreadily, but that incontinence in this respect should always meet not\r\nonly with indulgence but praise. 'Little improvement' he adds, 'can be\r\nexpected in morality until the producing too large families is regarded\r\nwith the same feeling as drunkenness, or any other physical excess.' A\r\nwell-known medical writer, Dr. Drysdale, in commenting on these words,\r\nadds: 'In this error, if error it be, I also humbly share.'\r\n\r\n'When dangerous prejudices,' says Sismondi, the learned historian of\r\nsouthern Europe, 'have not become accredited, when our true duties\r\ntowards those to whom we give life are not obscured in the name of a\r\nsacred authority, no married man will have more children than he can\r\nbring up properly.'\r\n\r\nSuch is the language of physicians and statesmen; but a stronger appeal\r\nhas been made for the sake of morality itself. The detestable crime of\r\n_abortion_ is appallingly rife in our day; it is abroad in our land to\r\nan extent which would have shocked the dissolute women of pagan Rome.\r\nTestimony from all quarters, especially from New England, has\r\naccumulated within the past few years to sap our faith in the morality\r\nand religion of American women. This wholesale, fashionable murder, how\r\nare we to stop it? Hundreds of vile men and women in our large cities\r\nsubsist by this slaughter of the innocents, and flaunt their ill-gotten\r\ngains--the price of blood--in our public thoroughfares. Their\r\nadvertisements are seen in the newspapers; their soul and body\r\ndestroying means are hawked in every town. With such temptation strewn\r\nin her path, what will the woman threatened with an excessive family\r\ndo? Will she not yield to evil, and sear her conscience with the\r\nrepetition of her wickedness? Alas! daily experience in the heart of a\r\ngreat city discloses to us only too frequently the fatal ease of such a\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nIn view of the injuries of excessive child-bearing on the one hand, and\r\nof this prevalent crime on the other, a man of genius and sympathy, Dr.\r\nRaciborski of Paris, took the position that the avoidance of offspring\r\nto a certain extent is not only legitimate, but should be recommended as\r\na measure of public good. 'We know how bitterly we shall be attacked,'\r\nhe says, 'for promulgating this doctrine; but if our ideas only render\r\nto society the services we expect of them, we shall have effaced from\r\nthe list of crimes the one most atrocious without exception, that of\r\nchild-murder, before or after birth, and we shall have poured a little\r\nhappiness into the bosoms of despairing families, where poverty is\r\nallied to the knowledge that offspring can be born only to prostitution\r\nor mendicity. The realization of such hopes will console us under the\r\nattacks upon our doctrines.'\r\n\r\nIt has been eagerly repeated by some, that the wish to limit offspring\r\narises most frequently from an inordinate desire of indulgence. We reply\r\nto such, that they do not know the human heart, and that they do it\r\ndiscredit. More frequently the wish springs from a love of children. The\r\nparents seek to avoid having more than they can properly nourish and\r\neducate. They do not wish to leave their sons and daughters in want.\r\n'This,' says a writer in _The Nation_ (of New York), in an article on\r\nthis interesting subject,--'this is not the noblest motive of action, of\r\ncourse, but there is something finely human about it.'\r\n\r\n'Very much indeed is it to be wished,' says Dr. Edward Reich, after\r\nreviewing the multitudinous evils which result to individuals and\r\nsociety from a too rapid increase in families, 'that the function of\r\nreproduction be placed under the dominion of the will.'\r\n\r\nMen are very ready to find an excuse for self-indulgence; and if they\r\ncannot get one anywhere else, they seek it in religion. They tell the\r\nwoman it is her duty to bear all the children she can. They refer her to\r\nthe sturdy, strong-limbed women of early times, to the peasant women of\r\nnorthern Europe, who emigrate to America, and ask and expect their wives\r\nto rival them in fecundity. Such do not reflect that they have been\r\nbrought up to light indoor employment, that their organization is more\r\nnervous and frail, that they absolutely have not the stamina required\r\nfor many confinements.\r\n\r\nMoreover, they presume too much in asking her to bear them. 'If a woman\r\nhas a right to decide on any question,' said a genial physician in the\r\nMassachusetts Medical Society a few years since, 'it certainly is as to\r\nhow many children she shall bear.' 'Certainly,' say the editors of a\r\nprominent medical journal, 'wives have a right to demand of their\r\nhusbands at least the same consideration which a breeder extends to his\r\nstock.' 'Whenever it becomes unwise that the family should be\r\nincreased,' says Sismondi again, '_justice_ and _humanity_ require that\r\nthe husband should impose on himself the same restraint which is\r\nsubmitted to by the unmarried.'\r\n\r\nAn eminent writer on medical statistics, Dr. Henry MacCormac, says: 'The\r\nbrute yields to the generative impulse when it is experienced. He is\r\ntroubled by no compunction about the matter. Now, a man ought not to act\r\nlike a brute. He has reason to guide and control his appetites. Too\r\nmany, however, forget, and act like brutes instead of as men. It would,\r\nin effect, prove very greatly conducive to man's interests were the\r\ngenerative impulses placed absolutely under the sway of right reason,\r\nchastity, forecast, and justice.'\r\n\r\nThere is no lack of authorities, medical and non-medical, on this point.\r\nFew who weigh them well will deny that there is such a thing as too\r\nlarge a family; that there does come a time when a mother can rightfully\r\ndemand rest from her labours, in the interest of herself, her children,\r\nand society. When is this time? Here again the impossibility meets us of\r\nstating a definite number of children, and saying, 'This many and no\r\nmore.' As in every other department of medicine, averages are of no\r\navail in guiding individuals. There are women who require no limitation\r\nwhatever. They can bear healthy children with rapidity, and suffer no\r\nill results. There are others--and they are the majority--who should use\r\ntemperance in this as in every other function; and there are a few who\r\nshould bear no children at all. It is absurd for physicians or\r\ntheologians to insist that it is either the physical or moral duty of\r\nthe female to have as many children as she possibly can have. It is\r\ntime that such an injurious prejudice was discarded, and the truth\r\nrecognised, that while marriage looks to offspring as its natural\r\nsequence, there should be inculcated such a thing as marital continence,\r\nand that excess here as elsewhere is repugnant to morality, and is\r\nvisited by the laws of physiology with certain and severe punishment on\r\nparent and child.\r\n\r\nContinence, self-control, a willingness to deny himself,--that is what\r\nis required from the husband. But a thousand voices reach us from\r\nsuffering women in all parts of our land that this will not suffice;\r\nthat men refuse thus to restrain themselves; that it leads to a loss of\r\ndomestic happiness and to illegal amours, or that it is injurious\r\nphysically and mentally,--that, in short, such advice is useless,\r\nbecause impracticable.\r\n\r\nTo such sufferers we reply that Nature herself has provided to some\r\nextent against over-production, and that it is well to avail ourselves\r\nof her provisions. It is well known that women when nursing rarely\r\nbecome pregnant, and for this reason, if for no other, women should\r\nnurse their own children, and continue the period until the child is at\r\nleast a year old. Be it remembered, however, that nursing, continued too\r\nlong, weakens both mother and child, and, moreover, ceases to accomplish\r\nthe end for which we now recommend it.\r\n\r\nAnother provision of nature is, that for a certain period between her\r\nmonthly illnesses every woman is sterile. The vesicle which matures in\r\nher ovaries, and is discharged from them by menstruation, remains some\r\ndays in the womb before it is passed forth and lost. How long its stay\r\nis we do not definitely know, and probably it differs in individuals.\r\nFrom ten to twelve days at most are supposed to elapse after the\r\n_cessation_ of the flow before the final ejection of the vesicle. For\r\nsome days after this the female is incapable of reproduction. But for\r\nsome days _before_ her monthly illness she is liable to conception, as\r\nfor that length of time the male element can survive. This period,\r\ntherefore, becomes a variable and an undetermined one, and even when\r\nknown, its observation demands a large amount of self-control.\r\n\r\nThere is one method widely in use in this country for the limitation of\r\noffspring which deserves only the most unqualified condemnation, which\r\nis certain to bring upon the perpetrators swift and terrible\r\nretribution, and which is opposed to every sentiment of nature and\r\nmorality. We mean\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRIME OF ABORTION.\r\n\r\n_From the moment of conception_ a new life commences; a new individual\r\nexists; another child is added to the family. The mother who\r\ndeliberately sets about to destroy this life, either by want of care, or\r\nby taking drugs, or using instruments, commits as great a crime, is just\r\nas guilty, as if she strangled her new-born infant, or as if she\r\nsnatched from her own breast her six-months' darling and dashed out its\r\nbrains against the wall. Its blood is upon her head, and as sure as\r\nthere is a God and a judgment, that blood will be required of her. The\r\ncrime she commits is _murder_, _child-murder_,--the slaughter of a\r\nspeechless, helpless being, whom it is her duty, beyond all things else,\r\nto cherish and preserve.\r\n\r\nThis crime is common; it is fearfully prevalent. Hundreds of persons are\r\ndevoted to its perpetration. It is their trade. In nearly every village\r\nits ministers stretch out their bloody hands to lead the weak woman to\r\nsuffering, remorse, and death. Those who submit to their treatment are\r\nnot generally unmarried women who have lost their virtue, but the\r\nmothers of families, respectable _Christian_ matrons, members of\r\nchurches, and walking in the better classes of society.\r\n\r\nWe appeal to all such with earnest and with threatening words. If they\r\nhave no feeling for the fruit of their womb, if maternal sentiment is so\r\ncallous in their breasts, let them know that such produced abortions are\r\nthe constant cause of violent and dangerous womb diseases, and\r\nfrequently of early death; that they bring on mental weakness, and often\r\ninsanity; that they are the most certain means to destroy domestic\r\nhappiness which can be adopted. Better, far better, to bear a child\r\nevery year for twenty years than to resort to such a wicked and\r\ninjurious step; better to die, if needs be, in the pangs of childbirth,\r\nthan to live with such a weight of sin on the conscience.\r\n\r\nThere is no need of either. By the moderation we have mentioned, it is\r\nin the power of any woman to avoid the evils of an excessive family,\r\nwithout injury and without criminality.\r\n\r\nWe feel obliged to speak in plain language of this hidden sin, because\r\nso many are ignorant that it is a sin. Only within a few years have\r\nthose who take in charge the public morals spoken of it in such terms\r\nthat this excuse of ignorance is no longer admissible.\r\n\r\nBishop Coxe, of New York, in a pastoral letter, the late Archbishop\r\nSpaulding, Catholic Primate of the United States, in an address at the\r\nclose of a recent Provincial Council at Baltimore, the Old and New\r\nSchool Presbyterian Churches, at a meeting in Philadelphia, have all\r\npronounced the severest judgments against those guilty of antenatal\r\ninfanticide. Appeals through the press have been made by physicians of\r\nhigh standing, and by eminent divines, which should be in the hands of\r\nevery one.\r\n\r\nThe chiefest difficulty hitherto has been, that while women were warned\r\nagainst the evils of abortion, they were offered no escape from the\r\nexhaustion and dangers of excessive child-bearing. This difficulty we\r\nhave fully recognised and fairly met, and, we believe, in such a manner\r\nthat neither the accuracy of our statements nor the purity of our\r\nmotives can be doubted. Should our position be attacked, however, the\r\nmedical man must know that in opposing our views, he opposes those of\r\nthe most distinguished physicians in Europe and in America; and the\r\ntheologian should be warned that, when a neglect of physical laws leads\r\nto moral evil, the only way to correct this evil is to remedy the\r\nneglect. In this case the neglect is over-production; the evil is\r\nabortion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF CONCEPTION.\r\n\r\nThe theories which have been advanced to explain the manner in which the\r\nhuman species is continued and reproduced are very numerous. Including\r\nthe hypotheses of the ancient philosophers, some two hundred and fifty\r\nhave been promulgated by the greatest thinkers of all times. The older\r\nones do not deserve mention, as they are replete with absurdities. Such,\r\nfor instance, is that of Pythagoras, which supposed that a vapor\r\ndescended from the brain and formed the embryo. The Scythians therefore\r\ntook blood from the veins behind the ears to produce impotence and\r\nsterility. Modern science has shown the total error of this and many\r\nother views formerly entertained on this subject. Has galvanism or\r\nelectricity any share in the mysterious function? Some among the modern\r\nphysiologists have supposed that there is an electrical or magnetic\r\ninfluence which effects generation. Even within a few months, Dr. Harvey\r\nL. Byrd, Professor of Obstetrics in the Medical Department of Washington\r\nUniversity of Baltimore, has asserted that he has 'every reason for\r\nbelieving that fecundation or impregnation is always an electrical\r\nphenomenon; ... it results from the completion of an electric\r\ncircle,--the union of positive and negative electricities.' This,\r\nhowever, is not accepted by all as the dictum of modern science.\r\nPhysiology has clearly established that the new being is the result of\r\ncontact between the male element, an independent, living animal, on the\r\none part, and the female element, a matured egg, on the other, involving\r\nthe union of the contents of two peculiar cells. Without such contact,\r\nfecundation cannot take place.\r\n\r\nThe only matter of practical moment in connection with this most\r\ninteresting function which we have to announce, is the influence of the\r\nmind on the offspring at the time of generation. This influence has long\r\nbeen remarked in regard to animals as well as men. Jacob was aware of it\r\nwhen he made his shrewd bargain with Laban for 'all the speckled and\r\nspotted cattle' as his hire. For we are told that then 'Jacob took him\r\nrods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree, and pilled\r\nwhite strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.\r\nAnd he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters\r\nin the watering-troughs, when the flocks came to drink, that they should\r\nconceive when they came to drink. And the flocks conceived before the\r\nrods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. And\r\nJacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks towards\r\nthe ringstraked and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his\r\nown flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle. And it\r\ncame to pass, whenever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid\r\nthe rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might\r\nconceive among the rods. But when the cattle were feeble, he put them\r\nnot in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.'\r\n\r\nThe impressions conveyed to the brain through the sense of sight are\r\nhere asserted by the writer of Genesis to have influenced the system of\r\nthe ewes so that they brought forth young marked in the same manner as\r\nthe rods placed before their eyes. It is not said that there was any\r\nmiraculous interposition; but the whole account is given as if it were\r\nan everyday, natural, and well-known occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, a people renowned for their physical beauty, seemed to be\r\naware of the value of mental impressions; for in their apartments they\r\nwere lavish of statues and paintings representing the gods and\r\ngoddesses, delineated in accordance with the best models of art.\r\n\r\nDionysus, tyrant of Syracuse, caused the portrait of the beautiful Jason\r\nto be suspended before the nuptial bed, in order to obtain a handsome\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThe following is related of the celebrated Galen:--A Roman magistrate,\r\nlittle, ugly, and hunch-backed, had by his wife a child exactly\r\nresembling the statue of Æsop. Frightened at the sight of this little\r\nmonster, and fearful of becoming the father of a posterity so deformed,\r\nhe went to consult Galen, the most distinguished physician of his time,\r\nwho counseled him to place three statues of love around the conjugal\r\nbed, one at the foot, the others, one on each side, in order that the\r\neyes of his young spouse might be constantly feasted on these charming\r\nfigures. The magistrate followed strictly the advice of the physician,\r\nand it is recorded that his wife bore him a child surpassing in beauty\r\nall his hopes.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the attributes of the child are determined to an important\r\nextent by the bodily and mental condition of the parents at the time of\r\nconception, explains the marked difference almost constantly observed\r\nbetween children born to the same parents, however strong the family\r\nlikeness may be among them. The changes constantly going on in the\r\nphysical, intellectual, and emotional states of the parents, produce a\r\ncorresponding alteration in offspring conceived at successive intervals.\r\nTwins generally resemble each other very closely in every respect.\r\n\r\nInasmuch, therefore, as the moment of generation is of much more\r\nimportance than is commonly believed in its effect upon the moral and\r\nphysical life of the future being, it is to be wished that parents would\r\npay some attention to this subject. It is the moment of creation,--that\r\nin which the first vital power is communicated to the new creature. Not\r\nwithout reason has nature associated with it the highest sensual\r\nexaltation of our existence. Dr. Hufeland, the author of _The Art of\r\nProlonging Life_, has said, 'In my opinion it is of the utmost\r\nimportance that this moment should be confined to a period when the\r\nsensation of collected powers, ardent passion, and a mind cheerful and\r\nfree from care, invite to it on both sides.'\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF FRUITFUL CONJUNCTION.\r\n\r\nThere are some women in whom the act of conception is attended with\r\ncertain sympathetic affections, such as faintness, vertigo, etc., by\r\nwhich they know that it has taken place.\r\n\r\nSwelling of the neck was regarded in ancient times as a sign of\r\nconception. Its truthfulness has been reaffirmed by modern authorities.\r\n\r\nIt has also been asserted that impregnation generally excites a\r\nuniversal tremor in all parts of the body, and that it is associated\r\nwith more than an ordinary degree of pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that enjoyment and impregnation bear\r\nnecessarily to each other the relation of cause and effect, although\r\nthis is the popular opinion. From too implicit a reliance upon this\r\ncurrent belief, wives are often incredulous as to their true condition.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that in some cases sickness at the stomach manifests itself\r\nalmost simultaneously with the act of fecundation. Authentic instances\r\nare on record of wives reckoning their confinement nine months from the\r\nfirst feeling of nausea, without ever making a mistake.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be said that peculiar sensations are often\r\nexperienced, frequently of a character difficult to explain; and many\r\nmodern authors attach to them a marked value. In this manner it is\r\npossible for a woman to be satisfied at the moment as to the change\r\nwhich has taken place; yet the evidence is often deceptive, and\r\nsometimes nothing peculiar is noticed.\r\n\r\nFrom the period of conception the mother has no direct knowledge of the\r\nprocess that is going on within, excepting by the effects of the\r\nincreasing pressure upon other parts, until 'quickening' takes place,\r\nwhich belongs to another part of our subject.\r\n\r\nThe signs and symptoms of pregnancy will be explained in full when we\r\ncome to treat of the pregnant condition in a future chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO RETAIN THE AFFECTIONS OF A HUSBAND.\r\n\r\nAh! this is a secret indeed!--worth the wand of the magician, the lamp\r\nof Aladdin, or the wishing-cap of the fairy. What could any of these\r\ngive in exchange for the love of a husband? Yet this pearl of great\r\nprice, how often is it treated as lightly and carelessly as if it was\r\nany bauble of Brummagem!\r\n\r\n'My husband,' we have heard young wives say, 'why, it is his duty to\r\nlove me. Why did he marry me if he is not going to love me, love me\r\nfondly, love me ever?'\r\n\r\nYes, we all know\r\n\r\n    Love the gift, is love the debt.\r\n\r\nBut in this world of ours it is often hard to get one's own; and when\r\ngot, our care must never cease, lest it be wrested from us. The plant\r\nyou bought at the greenhouse, and that now blossoms on your window-sill,\r\nbecame yours by purchase, but it has required your daily care to keep it\r\nalive and persuade it to unfold its blossoms. Infinitely more delicate\r\nis this plant of love. It, too, you purchased. You gave in exchange for\r\nit your own heart. It too, you must daily tend with constant solicitude,\r\nlest it wither and die.\r\n\r\nIn this country, some women think that anything is good enough to wear\r\nat home. They go about in slatternly morning dresses, unkempt hair, and\r\nslippers down at heel. 'Nobody will see me,' they say 'but my husband.'\r\nLet them learn a lesson from the wives of the Orient.\r\n\r\nIn those countries a married woman never goes abroad except in long\r\nsombre robes and thick veil. An English lady visiting the wife of one of\r\nthe wealthy merchants, found her always in full dress, with toilet as\r\ncarefully arranged as if she were going to a ball.\r\n\r\n'Why!' exclaimed the visitor, at length, 'is it possible that you take\r\nall this trouble to dress for nobody but your husband?'\r\n\r\n'Do, then,' asked the lady in reply, 'the wives of Englishmen dress for\r\nthe sake of pleasing other men?'\r\n\r\nThe visitor was mute.\r\n\r\nNot that we would wish our women to be for ever in full costume at home.\r\nThat would be alarming. But she who neglects neatness in attire, and,\r\nabove all, cleanliness of person, runs a great danger of creating a\r\nsentiment of disgust in those around her. Nothing is more repugnant to\r\nthe husband's senses than bad odors, and, for reasons which every woman\r\nknows, women who neglect cleanliness are peculiarly liable to them. When\r\nsimple means do not remove them, recourse should be promptly had to a\r\nmedical adviser.\r\n\r\nSo it is with bad breath. This sometimes arises from neglect of the\r\nteeth, sometimes from diseases of the stomach, lungs, etc. A man of\r\ndelicate olfactories is almost forced to hold at arm's length a wife\r\nwith a fetid breath.\r\n\r\nThere are some women--we have treated several--who are plagued with a\r\nmost disagreeable perspiration, especially about the feet, the arms,\r\netc. Such should not marry until this is cured. It is a rule among army\r\nsurgeons, to be chary about giving men their discharge from military\r\nservice on surgeon's certificate. But fetid feet are at times so\r\nhorribly offensive, that they are considered an allowable cause for\r\ndischarge. No doubt, in some of our States they would be received as a\r\nvalid ground for divorce!--certainly with quite as much reason as many\r\nof the grounds usually alleged.\r\n\r\nIn short, the judicious employment of all the harmless arts of the\r\ntoilet, and of those numerous and effective means which modern science\r\noffers, to acquire, to preserve, and to embellish beauty, is a duty\r\nwhich woman, whether married or single, should never neglect. With very\r\nlittle trouble, the good looks and freshness of youth can be guarded\r\nalmost to old age; and, even when hopelessly gone, simple and harmless\r\nmeans are at hand to repair the injuries of years, or at least to\r\nconceal them. But this is an art which would require a whole volume to\r\ntreat of, and which we cannot here touch upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nINHERITANCE.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the consideration of a very wonderful subject,--that of\r\ninheritance. It is one of absorbing interest, both because of the\r\ncurious facts it presents, and of the great practical bearing it has\r\nupon the welfare of every individual.\r\n\r\nIn order to the better understanding of this matter, it is necessary\r\nat the outset to make a distinction between four kinds or varieties of\r\ninheritance. The most generally recognised is _direct inheritance_,--that\r\nin which the children partake of the qualities of the father and\r\nmother. But a child may not resemble either parent, while it bears a\r\nstriking likeness to an uncle or aunt. This constitutes _indirect_\r\ninheritance. Again, a child may be more like one of its grandparents\r\nthan either its father or mother. Or, what is still more astonishing,\r\nit may display some of the characteristics possessed only by a\r\nremote ancestor. This form of inheritance is known by the scientific\r\nterm _atavism_, derived from the Latin word _atavus_, meaning an\r\nancestor. It is curious to note in this connection that sometimes a son\r\nresembles more closely his maternal than his paternal grandsire in some\r\nmale attribute,--as a peculiarity of beard, or certain diseases confined\r\nto the male sex. Though the mother cannot possess or exhibit such male\r\nqualities, she has transmitted them through her blood, from her father to\r\nher son.\r\n\r\nThe fourth variety of inheritance is that in which the child resembles\r\nneither parent, but the first husband of its mother. A woman contracting\r\na second marriage, transmits to the offspring of that marriage the\r\npeculiarities she has received through the first union. Breeders of\r\nstock know this tendency, and prevent their brood-mares, cows, or sheep\r\nfrom running with males of an inferior stock. Thus the diseases of a man\r\nmay be transmitted to children which are not his own. Even though dead,\r\nhe continues to exert an influence over the future offspring of his\r\nwife, by means of the ineffaceable impress he had made in the conjugal\r\nrelation upon her whole system, as we have previously mentioned. The\r\nmother finds in the children of her second marriage\r\n\r\n    '... the touch of a vanished hand,\r\n    And the sound of a voice that is still.'\r\n\r\nA child may therefore suffer through the operation of this mysterious\r\nand inexorable law, for sins committed not by its own father, but by the\r\nfirst husband of its mother. What a serious matter, then, is that\r\nrelation between the sexes called marriage! How far-reaching are its\r\nresponsibilities!\r\n\r\nA distinction must here be drawn between hereditary transmission and the\r\npossession of qualities at birth, which have not been the result of any\r\nimpression received from the system of father or mother, but due to\r\nmental influences or accidents operating through the mother. A child may\r\nbe born idiotic or deformed, not because either parent or one of its\r\nancestors was thus affected, but from the influence of some severe\r\nmental shock received by the mother during her pregnancy. This subject\r\nof maternal impressions will come up for separate consideration in the\r\ndiscussion of pregnancy. Again, a child may be epileptic, although there\r\nis no epilepsy in the family, simply because of the intoxication of the\r\nfather or mother at the time of the intercourse resulting in conception.\r\nSuch cases are not due to hereditary transmission, for that cannot be\r\nhereditary which has been possessed by neither the parents nor any other\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\nIn considering the effects of inheritance, we will first pass in review\r\nthose connected with the physical constitution. These are exceedingly\r\ncommon and universally known. Fortunately, not merely are evil qualities\r\ninherited, but beauty, health, vigor, and longevity also.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAUTY.\r\n\r\nGood looks are characteristic of certain families. Alcibiades, the\r\nhandsomest among the Grecians of his time, descended from ancestors\r\nremarkable for their beauty. So well and long has the desirable\r\ninfluence of inheritance in this respect been recognised, that there\r\nexisted in Crete an ancient law which ordained that each year the most\r\nbeautiful among the young men and women should be chosen and forced to\r\nmarry, in order to perpetuate the type of their beauty. Irregularities\r\nof feature are transmitted from parent to child through many\r\ngenerations. The aquiline nose has existed some centuries, and is yet\r\nhereditary in the Bourbon family. The hereditary under-lip of the House\r\nof Hapsburg is another example. When the poet Savage speaks of\r\n\r\n    'The tenth transmitter of a foolish face,'\r\n\r\nhe scarcely exaggerates what is often seen in families where some\r\nstrongly-marked feature or expression is long predominant or reappears\r\nin successive generations.\r\n\r\n\r\nNECK AND LIMBS.\r\n\r\nThe form and length of the neck and limbs are frequently hereditary, as\r\nis also the height of the body. The union of two tall persons engenders\r\ntall children. The father of Frederick the Great secured for himself a\r\nregiment of men of gigantic stature, by permitting the marriage of his\r\nguards only with women of similar height. A tendency to obesity often\r\nappears in generation after generation of a family. Yet such cases are\r\nwithin the reach of medical art.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLEXION.\r\n\r\nEven the complexion is not exempt from this influence. Blondes\r\nordinarily procreate blondes, and dark parents have dark-skinned\r\nchildren. An union in marriage of fair and dark complexions results in\r\nan intermediate shade in the offspring. Not always, however; for it has\r\nbeen asserted that the complexion chiefly follows that of the father.\r\nThe offspring of a black father and a white mother is much darker than\r\nthe progeny of a white father and a dark mother. In explanation of this\r\nfact, it has been said that the mother is not impressed by her own\r\ncolor, because she does not look upon herself, while the father's\r\ncomplexion attracts her attention, and thus gives a darker tinge to the\r\noffspring. Black hens frequently lay dark eggs; but the reverse is more\r\ngenerally found to be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL QUALITIES TRANSMITTED BY EACH PARENT.\r\n\r\nIn general, it may be said that there exists a tendency on the part of\r\nthe father to transmit the external appearance, the configuration of the\r\nhead and limbs, the peculiarities of the senses and of the skin and the\r\nmuscular condition; while the size of the body, and the general\r\ntemperament or constitution of the child, are derived from the mother.\r\nAmong animals, the mule, which is the produce of the male ass and the\r\nmare, is essentially a modified ass having the general configuration of\r\nits sire, but the rounded trunk and larger size of its dam. On the other\r\nhand, the hinny, which is the offspring of the stallion and the she-ass,\r\nis essentially a modified horse, having the general configuration of the\r\nhorse, but being a much smaller animal than its sire, and therefore\r\napproaching the dam in size as well as in the comparative narrowness of\r\nits trunk. The operation of this principle, though general, is not\r\nuniversal. Exceptions may easily be cited. In almost every large family\r\nit will be observed that the likeness to the father predominates in some\r\nchildren, while others most resemble the mother. It is rare to meet with\r\ninstances in which some distinctive traits of both parents may not be\r\ntraced in the offspring.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAIR.\r\n\r\nPeculiarities in the colour and structure of the hair are transmitted.\r\nDarwin mentions a family in which, for many generations, some of the\r\nmembers had a single lock differently coloured from the rest of the\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERAMENT.\r\n\r\nThe law of inheritance rules in regard to the production of the\r\ntemperament. The crossing of one temperament with another in marriage,\r\nproduces a modification in the offspring generally advantageous.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERTILITY.\r\n\r\nA peculiar aptitude for procreation is sometimes hereditary. The\r\nchildren of prolific parents are themselves prolific. It is related that\r\na French peasant woman was confined ten times in fifteen years. Her\r\npregnancies, always multiple, produced twenty-eight children. At her\r\nlast confinement she had three daughters, who all lived, married, and\r\ngave birth to children,--the first to twenty-six, the second to\r\nthirty-one, and the third to twenty-seven. On the contrary, sometimes a\r\ntendency to sterility is found fixed upon certain families, from which\r\nthey can only escape by the most assiduous care.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGEVITY.\r\n\r\nIn the vegetable kingdom, the oak inherits the power to live many years,\r\nwhile the peach-tree must die in a short time. In the animal kingdom,\r\nthe robin becomes grey and old at ten years of age; the rook caws\r\nlustily until a hundred. The ass is much longer-lived than the horse.\r\nThe mule illustrates in a striking manner the hereditary tendency of\r\nlongevity. It has the size of the horse, the long life of the ass. The\r\nweaker the ass, the larger, the stronger, and the shorter-lived and more\r\nhorse-like the mule. It is also a curious and instructive fact, that\r\nthis animal is the toughest after it has passed the age of the horse:\r\nthe inherited influence of the horse having been expended, the vitality\r\nand hardiness of the ass remain.\r\n\r\nIt is universally conceded, that longevity is the privileged possession\r\nof some lineages. That famous instance of old age, Thomas Parr, the\r\nbest authenticated on record, may be mentioned in illustration. It is\r\nvouched for by Harvey, the distinguished discoverer of the circulation\r\nof the blood. Parr died in the reign of Charles the First, at the age of\r\n152, after having lived under nine sovereigns of England. He left a\r\ndaughter aged 127. His father had attained to a great age, and his\r\ngreat-grandson died at Cork at the age of 103.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFORMITIES.\r\n\r\nDeformities are undoubtedly sometimes transmitted to the progeny. It is\r\nby no means rare to find that the immediate ancestors of those afflicted\r\nwith superfluous fingers and toes, club-feet, or hare-lips, were also\r\nthe subjects of these malformations. There are one or two families in\r\nGermany whose members pride themselves upon the possession of an extra\r\nthumb; and there is an Arab chieftain whose ancestors have from time\r\nimmemorial been distinguished by a double thumb upon the right hand.\r\nDarwin gives many similar instances. A case of curious displacement of\r\nthe knee-pans is recorded, in which the father, sister, son, and the son\r\nof the half-brother by the same father, had all the same malformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL PECULIARITIES.\r\n\r\nGait, gestures, voice, general bearing, are all inherited. Peculiar\r\nmanners, passing into tricks, are often transmitted, as in the case,\r\noften quoted, of the father who generally slept on his back with his\r\nright leg crossed over the left, and whose daughter, whilst an infant\r\nin the cradle, followed exactly the same habit, though an attempt was\r\nmade to cure her. Left-handedness is not unfrequently hereditary. It\r\nwould be very easy to go on multiplying instances, but we forbear.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO HAVE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nA practical question now naturally suggests itself. How can the vices of\r\nconformation be avoided, and beauty secured? The art of having handsome\r\nchildren, known under the name of _callipædia_, has received much\r\nattention, more, perhaps, in years gone by than of late. The noted Abbot\r\nQuillet wrote a book in Latin on the subject. Many other works, in which\r\nastrology plays a prominent part, were written on this art in the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that well-formed parents will transmit these\r\nqualities to their children, with scarcely an exception. Like begets\r\nlike. Unfortunately, all parents are not beautiful. Yet all desire\r\nbeautiful offspring. The body of the child can be influenced by the mind\r\nof the parent, particularly of the mother. A mind habitually filled with\r\npleasant fancies and charming images is not without its effect upon the\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nThe statues of Apollo, Castor and Pollux, Venus, Hebe, and the other\r\ngods and goddesses which were so numerous in the gardens and public\r\nplaces in Greece, reproduced themselves in the sons and daughters of the\r\npassers-by. We know also that marriages contracted at an age too early\r\nor too late, are apt to give imperfectly-developed children. The\r\ncrossing of temperaments and of nationalities beautifies the offspring.\r\nThe custom which has prevailed, in many countries, among the nobility,\r\nof purchasing the handsomest girls they could find for their wives, has\r\nlaid the foundation of a higher type of features among the ruling\r\nclasses. To obtain this desired end, conception should take place only\r\nwhen both parents are in the best physical condition, at the proper\r\nseason of the year, and with mutual passion. (We have already hinted how\r\nthis can be regulated.) During pregnancy the mother should often have\r\nsome painting or engraving representing cheerful and beautiful figures\r\nbefore her eyes, or often contemplate some graceful statue. She should\r\navoid looking at, or thinking of ugly people, or those marked with\r\ndisfiguring diseases. She should take every precaution to escape injury,\r\nfright, and disease of any kind, especially chicken-pox, erysipelas, or\r\nsuch disorders as leave marks on the person. She should keep herself\r\nwell nourished, as want of food nearly always injures the child. She\r\nshould avoid ungraceful positions and awkward attitudes, as by some\r\nmysterious sympathy these are impressed on the child she carries. Let\r\nher cultivate grace and beauty in herself at such a time, and she will\r\nendow her child with them. As anger and irritability leave imprints on\r\nthe features, she should maintain serenity and calmness.\r\n\r\n\r\nINHERITANCE OF TALENT AND GENIUS.\r\n\r\nThe effects of inheritance are perhaps more marked upon the mind than\r\nupon the body. This need not surprise us. If the peculiar form of the\r\nbrain can be transmitted, the mental attributes, the result of its\r\norganization, must necessarily also be transmitted.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of daily observation, that parents gifted with bright\r\nminds, cultivated by education, generally engender intelligent children;\r\nwhile the offspring of those steeped in ignorance are stupid from birth.\r\nIt may be objected, that men the most remarkable in ancient or modern\r\ntimes, as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Shakspeare, Milton, Buffon,\r\nCuvier, etc., have not transmitted their vast intellectual powers to\r\ntheir progeny. In explanation, it has been stated that what is known as\r\ngenius is not transmissible. The creation of a man of genius seems to\r\nrequire a special effort of Nature, after which, as if fatigued, she\r\nreposes a long time before again making a similar effort. But it may\r\nwell be doubted whether even those complex mental attributes on which\r\ngenius and talent depend are not inheritable, particularly when both\r\nparents are thus endowed. That distinguished men do not more frequently\r\nhave distinguished sons, may readily be accounted for when it is\r\nrecollected that the inherited character is due to the combined\r\ninfluence of both parents. The desirable qualities of the father may\r\ntherefore be neutralized in the offspring by the opposite or defective\r\nqualities of the mother. That contrasts in the disposition of parents\r\nare rather the rule than the exception, we have already shown. Every one\r\ntends to unite himself in friendship or love with a different character\r\nfrom his own, seeking thereby to supplement the qualities in which he\r\nfeels his own nature to be deficient. The mother, therefore, may weaken,\r\nand perhaps obliterate, the qualities transmitted by the father. Again,\r\nthe influence of some remote ancestors may make itself felt upon the\r\noffspring through the operation of the law of atavism, before alluded\r\nto, and thus prevent the children from equaling their parents in their\r\nnatural endowments. Notwithstanding the workings of these opposing\r\nforces, and others which might be mentioned, we find abundant\r\nillustration of the hereditary nature of talent and character.\r\n\r\nOf six hundred and five names occurring in a biographical dictionary\r\ndevoted to men distinguished as great founders and originators, between\r\nthe years 1453 and 1853, there were, as has been pointed out by Mr.\r\nGalton, no less than one hundred and two relationships, or one in six.\r\nWalford's _Men of the Time_ contains an account of the distinguished men\r\nin England, the Continent, and America, then living. Under the letter A\r\nthere are eighty-five names, and no less than twenty-five of these, or\r\none in three and a half, have relatives also in the list; twelve of them\r\nare brothers, and eleven fathers and sons. In Bryan's _Dictionary of\r\nPainters_, the letter A contains three hundred and ninety-one names of\r\nmen, of whom sixty-five are near relatives, or one in six; thirty-three\r\nof them are fathers and sons, and thirty are brothers. In Fétis's\r\n_Biographie Universelle des Musiciens_, the letter A contains five\r\nhundred and fifteen names, of which fifty are near relatives, or one in\r\nten. Confining ourselves to literature alone, it has been found that it\r\nis one to six and a half that a very distinguished literary man has a\r\nvery distinguished literary relative; and it is one to twenty-eight that\r\nthe relation is father and son, or brother and brother, respectively.\r\nAmong the thirty-nine Chancellors of England, sixteen had kinsmen of\r\neminence; thirteen of them had kinsmen of great eminence. These thirteen\r\nout of thirty-nine, or one in three, are certainly remarkable instances\r\nof the influence of inheritance. A similar examination has been\r\ninstituted in regard to the judges of the Supreme Court of\r\nMassachusetts, and other American States, with like results. The Greek\r\npoet Æschylus counted eight poets and four musicians among his\r\nancestors. The greater part of the celebrated sculptors of ancient\r\nGreece descended from a family of sculptors. The same is true of the\r\ngreat painters. The sister of Mozart shared the musical talent of her\r\nbrother. As there are reasons, to be detailed hereafter, for believing\r\nthat the influence of the mother is even greater than that of the\r\nfather, how vastly would the offspring be improved if distinguished men\r\nunited themselves in marriage to distinguished women for generation\r\nafter generation!\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF FATHERS OVER DAUGHTERS; OF MOTHERS OVER SONS.\r\n\r\nWe have already called attention to the parts of the physical\r\norganization transmitted by the father and by the mother. It would seem,\r\nmoreover, that each parent exercises a special influence over the child\r\naccording to its sex. The father transmits to the daughters the form of\r\nthe head, the framework of the chest and of the superior extremities,\r\nwhile the conformation of the lower portion of the body and the inferior\r\nextremities is transmitted by the mother. With the sons this is\r\nreversed. They derive from the mother the shape of the head and of the\r\nsuperior extremities, and resemble the father in the trunk and inferior\r\nextremities. From this it therefore results, that boys procreated by\r\nintelligent women will be intelligent, and that girls procreated by\r\nfathers of talent will inherit their mental capacity. The mothers of a\r\nnation, though unseen and unacknowledged in the halls of legislation,\r\ndetermine in this subtle manner the character of the laws.\r\n\r\nHistory informs us that the greater part of the women who have been\r\ncelebrated for their intelligence, reflected the genius of their\r\nfathers. Arete, the most celebrated woman of her time, on account of the\r\nextent of her knowledge, was the daughter of the distinguished\r\nphilosopher Aristippus, disciple of Socrates. Cornelia, the mother of\r\nthe Gracchi, was a daughter of Scipio. The daughter of the Roman emperor\r\nCaligula was as cruel as her father. Marcus Aurelius inherited the\r\nvirtues of his mother, and Commodus the vices of his. Charlemagne shut\r\nhis eyes upon the faults of his daughters, because they recalled his\r\nown. Genghis-Khan, the renowned Asiatic conqueror, had for his mother a\r\nwarlike woman. Tamerlane, the greatest warrior of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, was descended from Genghis-Khan by the female side. Catherine\r\nde Medicis was as crafty and deceitful as her father, and more\r\nsuperstitious and cruel. She had two sons worthy of herself,--Charles\r\nIX., who shot the Protestants, and Henry III., who assassinated the\r\nGuises. Her daughter, Margaret of Valois, recalled her father by her\r\ngentle manners. The cruel deeds of Alexander VI., the dark records of\r\nwhich will for ever stain the pages of history, are only rivaled in\r\natrocity by those of his children, the infamous Borgias. Arete, Hypatia,\r\nMadame de Staël, and George Sand,--all four had philosophers for their\r\nfathers. The mother of Bernardo Tasso had the gift of poetry. Buffon\r\noften speaks of the rich imagination of his mother. The poet Burns,\r\n'Rare Ben Jonson,' Goethe, Walter Scott, Byron, and Lamartine,--all were\r\nborn of women remarkable for their vivacity and brilliancy of language.\r\nByron, in his journal, attributes his hypochondria to a hereditary taint\r\nderived from his mother, who was its victim in its most furious form;\r\nand her father 'was strongly suspected of suicide.' He was said to have\r\nresembled more his maternal grandfather than any of his father's family.\r\nThe daughter of Molière was like her father in her wit and humor.\r\nBeethoven had for a maternal grandmother an excellent musician. The\r\nmother of Mozart gave the first lessons to her son. A crowd of composers\r\nhave descended from John Sebastian Bach, who long stood unrivaled as a\r\nperformer on the organ, and composer for that instrument. It may be\r\nremarked here, that it is almost invariably true that the ability or\r\ninability to acquire a knowledge of music is derived from the ancestry.\r\nParents who cannot turn a tune or tell one note from another, bring\r\nforth children equally unmoved 'with concord of sweet sounds.' Examples\r\ncould easily be adduced at still greater length, illustrating the direct\r\ninfluence of the father over the daughter, and of the mother over the\r\nson. Those given will suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE Of EDUCATION OVER INHERITED QUALITIES.\r\n\r\nIn correcting the evil effects of inheritance on the mind, education\r\nplays a very important part. A child born with a tendency to some vice\r\nor intellectual trait, may have this tendency entirely overcome, or at\r\nleast modified, by training. So, also, virtues implanted by nature may\r\nbe lost during the plastic days of youth, in consequence of bad\r\nassociations and bad habits.\r\n\r\nEducation can therefore do much to alter inherited mental and moral\r\nqualities. Can it be invoked to prevent the transmission of undesirable\r\ntraits, and secure the good? Everything that we have at birth is a\r\nheritage from our ancestors. Can virtuous habits be transmitted? Can we\r\nsecure virtues in our children by possessing them ourselves? Science\r\nsadly says, through her latest votaries, that we are scarcely more than\r\npassive transmitters of a nature we have received, and which we have no\r\npower to modify. It is only after exposure during several generations to\r\nchanged conditions or habits, that any modification in the offspring\r\nensues. The son of an old soldier learns his drill no more quickly than\r\nthe son of an artisan. We must therefore come to the conclusion with Mr.\r\nGalton, that to a great extent our own embryos have sprung immediately\r\nfrom the embryos whence our parents were developed, and these from the\r\nembryos of their parents, and so on for ever. Hence we are still\r\nbarbarians in our nature. We show it in a thousand ways. Children, who\r\nlove to dig and play in the dirt, have inherited that instinct from\r\nuntold generations of ancestors. Our remote forefathers were barbarians,\r\nwho dug with their nails to get at the roots on which they lived. The\r\ndelicately-reared child reverts to primeval habits. In like manner, the\r\nsilk-haired, parlor-nurtured spaniel springs from the caressing arms of\r\nits mistress, to revel in the filth of the roadside. It is the breaking\r\nout of inherited instinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSMISSION OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important part of the subject of inheritance, is that\r\nwhich remains for us to consider in relation to the transmission of\r\ndisease, or of a predisposition to it.\r\n\r\nConsumption,--that dread foe of modern life,--is the most frequently\r\nencountered of all affections as the result of inherited predisposition.\r\nIndeed some of the most eminent physicians have believed it is never\r\nproduced in any other way. Heart disease, disease of the throat,\r\nexcessive obesity, affections of the skin, asthma, disorders of the\r\nbrain and nervous system, gout, rheumatism, and cancer, are all\r\nhereditary. A tendency to bleed frequently, profusely and\r\nuncontrollably, from trifling wounds, is often met with as a family\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nThe inheritance of diseased conditions is also _influenced by the sex_.\r\nA parent may transmit disease exclusively to children of the same sex,\r\nor exclusively to those of the opposite sex. Thus, a horn-like\r\nprojection on the skin peculiar to the Lambert family was transmitted\r\nfrom the father to his sons and grandsons alone. So mothers have through\r\nseveral generations transmitted to their daughters alone supernumerary\r\nfingers, color-blindness, and other deformities and diseases. As a\r\ngeneral rule, any disease acquired during the life of either parent,\r\nstrongly tends to be inherited by the offspring of the same sex rather\r\nthan the opposite. We have spoken of the apparently reverse tendency in\r\nregard to the transmission of genius and talent.\r\n\r\n\r\nARE MUTILATIONS INHERITABLE?\r\n\r\nHow, it may be inquired, is it in regard to the inheritance of parts\r\nmutilated and altered by injuries and disease during the life of either\r\nparent? In some cases mutilations have been practised for many\r\ngenerations, without any inherited result. Different races of men have\r\nknocked out their upper teeth, cut off the joints of their fingers, made\r\nimmense holes through their ears and nostrils, and deep gashes in\r\nvarious parts of their bodies, and yet there is no reason for supposing\r\nthat these mutilations have been inherited. The _Comprachicos_, a\r\nhideous and strange association of men and women, existed in the\r\nseventeenth century, whose business it was to buy children and make of\r\nthem monsters. Victor Hugo, in a recent work, has graphically told how\r\nthey took a face and made of it a snout, how they bent down growth,\r\nkneaded the physiognomy, distorted the eyes, and in other ways\r\ndisfigured 'the human form divine,' in order to make fantastic\r\nplaythings for the amusement of the noble-born. But history does not\r\nstate that these deformities were inherited; certainly no race of\r\nmonsters has resulted. The pits from small-pox are not inherited, though\r\nmany successive generations must have been thus pitted by that disease\r\nbefore the beneficent discovery of the immortal Jenner. Children born\r\nwith scars left by pustules have had small-pox in the womb, acquired\r\nthrough the system of the mother. On the other hand, the lower animals,\r\ncats, dogs, and horses, which have had their tails and legs artificially\r\naltered or injured, have produced offspring with the same condition of\r\nparts. A man who had his little finger on the right hand almost cut off,\r\nand which in consequence grew crooked, had sons with the same finger on\r\nthe same hand similarly crooked. The eminent physiologist Dr.\r\nBrown-Séquard mentions, that many young guinea-pigs inherited an\r\nepileptic tendency from parents which had been subjected to an operation\r\nat his hands resulting in the artificial production of fits; while a\r\nlarge number of guinea-pigs bred from animals which had not been\r\noperated on were not thus affected. At any rate, it cannot but be\r\nadmitted that injuries and mutilations which cause disease, are\r\noccasionally inherited. But many cases of deformities existing at birth,\r\nas hare-lip, are not due to inheritance, although present in the father.\r\nThey arise from a change effected in the child while in the womb,\r\nthrough an impression made upon the mind of the mother, as will be shown\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE EFFECTS OF INHERITANCE.\r\n\r\nNot only are diseases inherited which make their appearance at birth,\r\nbut those which defer their exhibition until a certain period of life\r\ncorresponding with that at which they showed themselves in the parents.\r\nThus in the Lambert family, before referred to, the porcupine\r\nexcrescence on the skin began to grow in the father and sons at the same\r\nage, namely, about nine weeks after birth. In an extraordinary hairy\r\nfamily, which has been described, children were produced during three\r\ngenerations with hairy ears: in the father, the hair began to grow over\r\nhis body at six years old; in his daughter somewhat earlier, namely, at\r\none year; and in both generations the milk teeth appeared late in life,\r\nthe permanent teeth being deficient. Greyness of hair at an unusually\r\nearly age has been transmitted in some families. So, also, has the\r\npremature appearance of baldness.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO AVOID THE TENDENCY OF INHERITANCE.\r\n\r\nThese facts suggest the practical consideration, that in those diseases\r\nthe predisposition to which alone is inherited, and which break out only\r\nafter a lapse of time, it is often altogether possible to prevent the\r\npredisposition being developed into positive disease. Thus, for\r\ninstance, the inherited tendency to _consumption_ remains asleep in the\r\nsystem until about the age of puberty, or later. Therefore, by the use\r\nof a diet in which animal food forms a large portion, properly\r\nregulated, and systematic exercise in the open air, the practice of the\r\nlong inhalations before recommended, warm, comfortable clothing,\r\ntogether with a residence, if practicable, during the changeable and\r\ninclement seasons of the year, in an equable climate, we can often\r\nentirely arrest the development of the disease. Prevention here is not\r\nonly better than cure, but often all that is possible. Those in whom the\r\ndisease has become active, must too often, like those who entered\r\nDante's infernal regions, 'abandon hope.' Let our words of caution\r\ntherefore be heeded.\r\n\r\nWhen there is reason to believe that an individual possesses an inherent\r\ntendency to any disease, it is the duty of the medical adviser to study\r\nthe constitution of the patient thoroughly, and after such study to\r\nrecommend those measures of prevention best suited to avert the\r\nthreatened disorder. Above all, let the physician look closely to the\r\nchild at the period of life when any grave constitutional inheritable\r\ndisease attacked the parent. This supervision should be carried into\r\nadult years, for there are instances on record of inherited diseases\r\ncoming on at an advanced age, as in that of a grandfather, father, and\r\nson, who all became insane and committed suicide near their fiftieth\r\nyear. Gout, apoplexy, insanity, chronic disease of the heart, epilepsy,\r\nconsumption, asthma, and other diseases, are all more or less under the\r\ncontrol of preventive measures. Some hereditary diseases, such as idiocy\r\nand cancer, we are impotent to prevent, in the present state of our\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nA singular fact in connection with the transmission of disease is the\r\nreadiness with which a whole generation is passed over, the affection\r\nappearing in the next. A father or mother with consumption may in some\r\ninstances have healthy children, but the grandchildren will die of the\r\ndisease. Nature kindly favors one generation, but only at the expense of\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\nSome diseases require, in addition to the general means of prevention to\r\nbe found in a strict observance of the laws of health, some special\r\nmeasures in order to effectually ward off their appearance. But the\r\nextent of this work will not admit of their discussion. Already, indeed,\r\nhave we unduly, perhaps, extended our remarks upon inheritance. The\r\ninterest and importance of the facts must be our justification.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY ARE WOMEN REDUNDANT?\r\n\r\nIt cannot be without interest to look into the relative proportion of\r\nmen and women now living. It will interest us still more to inquire into\r\nthe reason why one sex preponderates over the other in numbers. This\r\ndone, we will answer the question; Is the production of sex at all under\r\nthe influence of the human will?\r\n\r\nThe female sex is the more numerous in all thickly populated parts of\r\nthe world where we have trustworthy statistics. In Austria, England, and\r\nWales, there are nearly one hundred and five women for every one hundred\r\nmen. In Sweden they are as one hundred and nine to one hundred. In all\r\ncities the disproportion is greater than in the country. In London there\r\nare one hundred and thirteen women to every one hundred men; and in the\r\nlarge towns of Sweden they stand as one hundred and sixteen to one\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nThis is not true, however, of newly-populated regions. The relative\r\ndifference is reversed in recent and thinly-settled localities. In our\r\nWestern States, for instance, the number of the men exceeds that of the\r\nwomen. In California they are as three to one; in Nevada as eight to\r\none; in Colorado, twenty to one. In the State of Illinois there were,\r\naccording to a recent United States census, ninety-three thousand more\r\nmen than women. In Massachusetts, on the contrary, there are between\r\nfifty and sixty thousand more women than men.\r\n\r\nThe disproportion of men to women in new countries is due to the\r\ndisinclination of women to emigrate. They are also unfitted for the\r\nhardships of pioneer life.\r\n\r\nHow is this general preponderance in the number of women produced? Is it\r\nbecause there are more girls born than boys? Not at all. The statistics\r\nof over fifty-eight millions of persons show that there are one hundred\r\nand six living boys born to every one hundred girls. In the state of\r\nRhode Island, for instance, the proportion for three years, from 1853 to\r\n1855, was one thousand and sixty-four boys born to one thousand girls.\r\nBut now we meet with the wonderful arrangement of nature, that a larger\r\nproportional number of male infants die during the first year of their\r\nlives than of females. In the second year, the mortality, though less\r\nexcessive, still remains far greater on the male side. It subsequently\r\ndecreases, and at the age of four or five years is nearly equal for both\r\nsexes. In after life, from the age of fifteen to forty, the mortality is\r\nsomething greater among women, but not sufficiently so to make the\r\nnumber of the two sexes equal. The greater tendency of male offspring to\r\ndie early is seen even before birth, for more male children are\r\nstill-born than female,--namely, as three to two. For this reason, the\r\nterm 'the stronger sex,' applied to men, has been regarded by some\r\nauthors as a misnomer. They are physically weaker in early life, and\r\nsuccumb more readily to noxious influences.\r\n\r\nHaving thus pointed out that there are more women actually living in the\r\nworld than men, although a larger number of boys are born than girls, we\r\nwill consider for a moment some of the laws of nature which determine\r\nthe number of the sexes. Without giving the figures,--which would make\r\ndry reading,--we will state in brief the conclusions derived from many\r\nobservations, extending over many years and many nationalities. The\r\nrelative age of the parents has an especial influence upon the sex of\r\nthe children. Seniority on the father's side gives excess of male\r\noffspring. Equality in the parents' age gives a slight preponderance of\r\nfemale offspring. Seniority on the mother's side gives excess of female\r\noffspring. This tallies with the fact that in all civilized countries,\r\nas has been stated, the proportion of male births is greater than that\r\nof females; for, in accordance with the customs of society, the husband\r\nis generally older than the wife. A curious instance, in confirmation\r\nof this law, has recently come under our observation. A patient, married\r\nfor the second time, is ten years older than her husband. She has two\r\nchildren by him, both girls. Singular to relate, her former husband was\r\nten years older than herself, and by him she had four children, of whom\r\nthree were boys, the fourth (a girl) having a twin brother.\r\n\r\nStill, the relative age is not the sole cause which fixes the sex of the\r\nchild. Its operation is sometimes overruled by conflicting agencies. In\r\nsome districts of Norway, for example, there has been a constant\r\ndeficiency in boys, while in others the reverse has been the case. The\r\ncircumstance is well known, that after great wars, and sometimes\r\nepidemics, in which a disproportionate number of men have died, more\r\nboys are born than usual. Men who pass a sedentary life, and especially\r\nscholars who exhaust their nervous force to a great extent, beget more\r\ngirls than boys. So, also, a very advanced age on the man's side\r\ndiminishes the number of males among the offspring. The quantity and the\r\nquality of the food; the elevation of the abode; the conditions of\r\ntemperature; the parents' mode of life, rank, religious belief,\r\nfrequency of sexual intercourse,--have all been shown to be causes\r\ncontributing to the disproportion of the sexes, besides the relative\r\nages of the parents.\r\n\r\nSome writers have stated that a southerly or warm and humid constitution\r\nof the year is most favorable to the birth of female infants, while in\r\ncold and dry years most males are produced. This statement has not been\r\nsupported by trustworthy statistics in regard to the human race, but in\r\nrespect of domestic animals the agriculturists of France have long\r\nobserved that the season has much to do with the sex. When the weather\r\nis dry and cold, and the wind northerly, mares, ewes, and heifers\r\nproduce more males than when the opposite meteorological condition\r\nprevails.\r\n\r\nThe saying among nurses, that 'This is the year for sons or daughters,'\r\nis based upon the erroneous supposition that mothers bring forth more\r\nmale infants in one year than in another.\r\n\r\nThat, however, which concerns us the most in this connection, is the\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n\r\nCAN THE SEXES BE PRODUCED AT WILL?\r\n\r\nThis question was asked many centuries ago. It was a hard one, and\r\nremained without a satisfactory answer until quite recently. Science has\r\nat last replied to it with authority. M. Thury, Professor in the Academy\r\nof Geneva, has shown how males and females may be produced in accordance\r\nwith our wishes.\r\n\r\nSome families are most anxious for male offspring, others ardently\r\ndesire daughters. And would it not often be a matter of national concern\r\nto control the percentage of sexes in the population? Is it not a\r\n'consummation most devoutly to be wished,' to bring about that Utopian\r\ncondition when there would be no sighing maids at home, nor want of\r\nwarriors in the field? The discussion of this subject is therefore\r\nimportant and allowable.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that queen-bees lay female eggs first, and male\r\neggs afterwards. So with hens: the first-laid eggs give female, the\r\nlast male products. Mares shown the stallion late in their periods, drop\r\nhorse-colts rather than fillies.\r\n\r\nProfessor Thury, from the consideration of these and other like facts,\r\nformed this law for stock-raisers: 'If you wish to produce females, give\r\nthe male at the first signs of heat; if you wish males, give him at the\r\nend of the heat.' But it is easy to form a theory. How was this law\r\nsustained in practice? We have now in our possession the certificate of\r\na Swiss stock-grower, son of the President of the Swiss Agricultural\r\nSociety, Canton de Vaud, under date of February 1867, which says:\r\n\r\n'In the first place, on twenty-two successive occasions I desired to\r\nhave heifers. My cows were of Schurtz breed, and my bull a pure Durham.\r\nI succeeded in these cases. Having bought a pure Durham cow, it was very\r\nimportant for me to have a new bull, to supersede the one I had bought\r\nat great expense, without leaving to chance the production of a male. So\r\nI followed accordingly the prescription of Professor Thury, and the\r\nsuccess has proved once more the truth of the law. I have obtained from\r\nmy Durham bull six more bulls (Schurtz-Durham cross) for fieldwork; and\r\nhaving chosen cows of the same color and height, I obtained perfect\r\nmatches of oxen. My herd amounted to forty cows of every age.\r\n\r\n'In short, I have made in all twenty-nine experiments after the new\r\nmethod, and in every one I succeeded in the production of what I was\r\nlooking for--male and female. I had not one single failure. All the\r\nexperiments have been made by myself, without any other person's\r\nintervention; consequently, I do declare that I consider as real and\r\ncertainly perfect the method of Professor Thury.'\r\n\r\nA perfectly trustworthy observer communicates by the _Medical and\r\nSurgical Reporter_ of Philadelphia for May 2, 1868, the results of\r\nsimilar experiments on animals, with like conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe plan of M. Thury was also tried on the farms of the late Emperor of\r\nthe French, with, it is asserted, the most unvarying success.\r\n\r\nWhat is the result of the application of this law to the human race? Dr.\r\nF. J. W. Packman, of Wimborne, has stated in the _Lancet_, that, 'in the\r\nhuman female, conception in the first half of the time between menstrual\r\nperiods produces female offspring, and male in the latter. When a female\r\nhas gone beyond the time she calculated upon, it will generally turn out\r\nto be a boy.'\r\n\r\nIn the Philadelphia _Medical and Surgical Reporter_ for February 8,\r\n1868, a respectable physician writes that, in numerous instances that\r\nhave come under his observation, Professor Thury's theory has proved\r\ncorrect, 'Whenever intercourse has taken place in from two to six days\r\nafter the cessation of the menses, girls have been produced; and\r\nwhenever intercourse has taken place in from nine to twelve days after\r\nthe cessation of the menses, boys have been produced. In every case I\r\nhave ascertained not only the date at which the mother placed\r\nconception, but also the time when the menses ceased, the date of the\r\nfirst and subsequent intercourse for a month or more after the\r\ncessation of the menses,' etc.\r\n\r\nAgain, a physician writes to the same journal for June 20, 1868,\r\nrecording the result of his own experience.\r\n\r\nA farmer in Louisiana states, in the _Turf, Field, and Farm_, in support\r\nof this law, that 'I have already been able in many cases to guess with\r\ncertainty the sex of a future infant. More than thirty times, among my\r\nfriends, I have predicted the sex of a child before its birth, and the\r\nevent proved nearly every time that I was right.'\r\n\r\nThe wife, therefore, who would wish, as Macbeth desired of his, to\r\n\r\n    'Bring forth men-children only,'\r\n\r\nshould avoid exposing herself to conception during the early part of the\r\ntime between her menstrual periods.\r\n\r\nThe prediction of the sex of the child before birth can now be with some\r\naccuracy made by the intelligent and skilful physician. The method of\r\ndoing so will be mentioned in treating of pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWIN-BEARING.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, a woman has one child at a time. Twins, when they occur, are\r\nlooked upon with disfavor by most people. There is a popular notion that\r\nthey are apt to be wanting in physical and mental vigor. This opinion is\r\nnot without foundation. A careful scientific examination of the subject\r\nhas shown, that of imbeciles and idiots a much larger proportion is\r\nactually found among the twins born than in the general community. In\r\nfamilies where twinning is frequent, bodily deformities likewise occur\r\nwith frequency. Among the relatives of imbeciles and idiots,\r\ntwin-bearing is common. In fact, the whole history of twin-births is of\r\nan exceptional character, indicating imperfect development and feeble\r\norganization in the product, and leading us to regard twins in the human\r\nspecies as a departure from the physiological rule, and therefore\r\ninjurious to all concerned. Monsters born without brains have rarely\r\noccurred except among twins.\r\n\r\nThe birth of twins occurs once in about eighty deliveries. A woman is\r\nmore apt to have no children than to have more than one at a time. In\r\nview of the increased danger to both mother and child, this rarity of a\r\nplural birth is fortunate.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY ARE TWINS BORN?\r\n\r\nWhat are the causes or favouring circumstances bringing about this\r\nabnormal child-bearing? For it is brought about by the operation of\r\nlaws. It is not an accident. There are no accidents in nature. By some\r\nit is supposed to be due to the mother, by some to the father. There are\r\nfacts in favour of both opinions. Certain women married successively to\r\nseveral men have always had twins, while their husbands with other wives\r\nhave determined single births. Certain men have presented the same\r\nphenomenon. We can scarcely cite an example more astonishing than that\r\nof a countryman who was presented to the Empress of Russia in 1755. He\r\nhad had two wives. The first had fifty-seven children in twenty-one\r\nconfinements; the second, thirty-three in thirteen. All the confinements\r\nhad been quadruple, triple, or double. A case has come under our own\r\nobservation in which the bearing of twins has seemed to be due to a\r\nconstitutional cause. The wife has nine children. The first was a single\r\nbirth, a girl; the others were all twin-births, and boys.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that compound pregnancies are more frequent in\r\ncertain years than in others. But that which seems to exert the greatest\r\nactual influence over the production of twins is the age of the mother.\r\nVery extensive statistics have demonstrated that, from the earliest\r\nchild-bearing period until the age of forty is reached, the fertility of\r\nmothers in twins gradually increases. Between the ages of twenty and\r\nthirty, fewest wives have twins. The average age of the twin-bearer is\r\nolder than the general run of bearers. It is well known that by far the\r\ngreater number of twins are born of elderly women. While three-fifths of\r\nall births occur among women under thirty years of age, three-fifths of\r\nall the twins are born to those over thirty years of age. Newly-married\r\nwomen are more likely to have twins at the first labour the older they\r\nare. The chance that a young wife from fifteen to nineteen shall bear\r\ntwins is only as one to one hundred and eighty-nine; from thirty-five to\r\nthirty-nine the chance is as one to forty-five,--that is, the wives\r\nmarried youngest have fewest twins; and there is an increase as age\r\nadvances, until forty is reached.\r\n\r\nRace seems to have some influence over plural births. They occur\r\nrelatively oftener among the Irish than among the English.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF TWIN-BEARING ON SIZE OF FAMILIES.\r\n\r\nDo women bearing twins have in the end larger families than those never\r\nhaving but one at a time? Popular belief would answer this question in\r\nthe affirmative. Such a reply would also seem to receive support from\r\nthe fact, well established, that twins are more frequently additions to\r\nan already considerable family than they are either the first of a\r\nfamily or additional to a small family. But statistics have not answered\r\nthis question as yet positively. They seem, however, in favour of the\r\nsupposition that twin-bearing women have larger families than their\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nWomen are more apt to have twins in their first pregnancy than any\r\nother, but after the second confinement the bearing of twins increases\r\nin frequency with the number of the pregnancy. It becomes, therefore, an\r\nindication of an excessive family, and is to be deplored.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE THAN TWO CHILDREN AT A BIRTH.\r\n\r\nCases of the birth of more than two children at a time are still less\r\nfrequently met with than twins. They are scarcely ever encountered,\r\nexcepting in women who have passed their thirtieth year. Such cases are\r\nall more or less unfortunate both for the mother and the children.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE AT A BIRTH.\r\n\r\nThe births of triplets are not exclusively confined to women above\r\nthirty years, but in those younger they are so rare as to be great\r\ncuriosities. Neither are they apt to occur in the first pregnancy. In\r\nthis respect they differ from twins, who, as has just been said, are\r\npeculiarly prone to make their appearance at the first childbirth. Only\r\nfour cases of treble births occurred among the 36,000 accouchements\r\nwhich have taken place in the Hospice de Maternité of Paris in a\r\ndetermined time. Out of 48,000 cases of labor in the Royal Maternity\r\nCharity in London, only three triplets occurred. History informs us that\r\nthe three Roman brothers, the Horatii, were triplets. They fought and\r\nconquered the three Curiatii of Alba (667 B. C.) who were likewise\r\ntriplets.\r\n\r\nAs an interesting fact in connection with this subject, we may mention\r\nthat in the St. Petersburg Midwives' Institute, between 1845-59, there\r\nwere three women admitted, who, in their fifteenth pregnancies, had\r\ntriplets, and each had triplets three times in succession. Happily, the\r\nfifteenth pregnancy is not reached by most women.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR AT A BIRTH.\r\n\r\nInstances of quadruplets are fewer than triplets. But four vigorous\r\ninfants have been born at one birth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE AT A BIRTH.\r\n\r\nThe birth of _five_ living children at a time is very exceptional, and\r\nis usually fatal to the offspring. A remarkable case of this kind is\r\nreported in a late medical journal. A woman aged thirty, the wife of a\r\nlaborer, and the mother of six children, was taken in labor about the\r\nseventh month of her pregnancy. Five children, and all alive, were given\r\nbirth to,--three boys and two girls. Four of the children survived an\r\nhour, and died within a few moments of each other. The fifth, a female,\r\nand the last born, lived six hours, and was so vigorous that,\r\nnotwithstanding its diminutive size, hopes were entertained of its\r\nsurviving.\r\n\r\nAnother case is reported in a recent French medical journal. The woman\r\nwas forty years old. She had had twins once, and single children five\r\ntimes. On her seventh pregnancy, when five months gone, she was as large\r\nas women usually are at the end of their full term. At the close of the\r\nmonth she was delivered of five children. They were all born alive, and\r\nlived from four to seven minutes. All five children were males, well\r\nbuilt and as well developed as foetuses of five and one-half months\r\nusually are in a single birth. The woman made a good recovery. Other\r\ncases of five at a birth might be quoted. They are known to medical\r\nscience as very singular and noteworthy occurrences.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCREDIBLE NUMBERS.\r\n\r\nSome books speak of seven, eight, nine, ten, and more, children at a\r\nbirth. But these statements are so marvelous, so incredible, and\r\nunsupported by proper testimony, that they do not merit any degree of\r\nconfidence. The climax of such extraordinary assertions is reached, and\r\na good illustration of the credulity of the seventeenth century\r\nfurnished, by a writer named Goftr. This traveller, in 1630, saw a\r\ntablet in a church at Leusdown (Lausdunum), about five miles from the\r\nHague, with an inscription stating that a certain illustrious countess,\r\nwhose name and family he records, brought forth at one birth, in the\r\nfortieth year of her age, in the year 1276, 365 infants. They were all\r\nbaptized by Guido, the Suffragan. The males were called John, and the\r\nfemales Elizabeth. They all, with their mother, died on the same day,\r\nand were buried in the above-mentioned church. This monstrous birth was\r\nsaid to have been caused by the sin of the countess in insulting a poor\r\nwoman with twins in her arms, who prayed that her insulter might have at\r\none birth the same number of children as there were days in the year. Of\r\ncourse, notwithstanding the story being attested by a tablet in a\r\nchurch, it must be placed among the many other instances of superstition\r\nafforded by an ignorant and credulous era.\r\n\r\nWe may remark, in closing this subject, that fewer plural births come to\r\nmaturity than pregnancies with single children. Miscarriages are\r\ncomparatively more frequent in such pregnancies than in ordinary ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREGNANCY\r\n\r\n\r\n_VENERATION FOR THE PREGNANT._\r\n\r\nWe have been considering woman hitherto as maiden and wife. She now\r\napproaches the sacred threshold of maternity. She is with child. In no\r\nperiod of her life is she the subject of an interest so profound and\r\ngeneral. The young virgin and the new wife have pleased by their grace,\r\nspirit, and beauty. The pregnant wife is an object of active benevolence\r\nand religious respect. It is interesting to note how, at all times and\r\nin all countries, she has been treated with considerate kindness and\r\ngreat deference. She has been made the subject of public veneration, and\r\nsometimes even of religious worship. At Athens and at Carthage the\r\nmurderer escaped from the sword of justice if he sought refuge in the\r\nhouse of a pregnant woman. The Jews allowed her to eat forbidden meats.\r\nThe laws of Moses pronounced the penalty of death against all those who\r\nby bad treatment or any act of violence caused a woman to abort.\r\nLycurgus compared women who died in pregnancy to the brave dead on the\r\nfield of honour, and accorded to them sepulchral inscriptions. In\r\nancient Rome, where all citizens were obliged to rise and stand during\r\nthe passage of a magistrate, wives were excused from rendering this mark\r\nof respect, for the reason that the exertion and hurry of the movement\r\nmight be injurious to them in the state in which they were supposed to\r\nbe. In the kingdom of Pannonia all enceinte women were in such\r\nveneration, that a man meeting one on the road was obliged, under\r\npenalty of a fine, to turn back and accompany and protect her to her\r\nplace of destination. The Catholic Church has in all times exempted\r\npregnant wives from fasts. The Egyptians decreed, and in most Christian\r\ncountries the law at the present time obtains, that if a woman shall be\r\nconvicted of an offence the punishment of which is death, the sentence\r\nshall not be executed if it be proved that she is pregnant.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\n1. The sign most commonly relied upon is the _cessation of the monthly\r\nsickness_. The wife who misses the expected return of her illness, is\r\napt to conclude that conception has taken place. This sign is far from\r\nbeing an infallible one.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that young married women sometimes have a\r\nslight show for two or three periods after their first impregnation.\r\nIgnorance of this fact has very frequently led to a miscalculation of\r\nthe time of confinement. On the other hand, the menses will sometimes\r\nbecome arrested soon after marriage, and continue so for one or two\r\nmonths, without there existing any pregnancy. The temporary\r\ndisappearance of the monthly sickness in such cases is due to the\r\nprofound impression made upon the system by the new relations of the\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nIt not unfrequently happens that menstruation continues with regularity\r\nduring the whole period of pregnancy. Exceptional cases are given by\r\ndistinguished writers on midwifery, of women menstruating during their\r\npregnancy, and at no other time.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, when a healthy wife misses her monthly sickness, she\r\nis pregnant. But this symptom, though a strong one, must be supported by\r\nothers before it can be regarded as establishing anything.\r\n\r\n2. _Morning sickness_ is a very common, a very early, and, in the\r\nopinion of most mothers, a very conclusive symptom of pregnancy. We have\r\nalready had occasion to remark that it sometimes makes its appearance\r\nalmost simultaneously with conception. It usually comes on in the first\r\nfew weeks, and continues until the third or fourth month or until\r\nquickening. This symptom is apt to be a troublesome one. Often the\r\nvomiting is slight, and immediately followed by relief. But it may\r\nproduce violent and ineffectual straining for some time. It is, however,\r\nnot to be called a disease: unless it proceeds to an exhausting degree,\r\nit must be looked upon as favorable and salutary. There is an old and\r\ntrue proverb, that 'a sick pregnancy is a safe one.' The absence of\r\nnausea and vomiting is a source of danger to the mother and child. Women\r\nwho habitually fail to experience them, are exceedingly apt to miscarry.\r\nIn such cases medical skill should be invoked to bring about the return\r\nof these symptoms, of such importance to healthful pregnancy.\r\n\r\nMorning sickness is therefore a very general, almost constant,\r\naccompaniment of the pregnant condition; and great dependence may be\r\nplaced upon it as a sign.\r\n\r\n3. _Changes in the breasts_ are valuable as symptoms. They become larger\r\nand firmer, and the seat of a pricking or stinging sensation. The\r\nnipples are swollen, prominent, and sometimes sore or painful. The veins\r\nbeneath the skin appear more conspicuous, and of a deeper blue than\r\nordinary. The peculiar circles of rose-coloured skin which surround the\r\nnipples increase in extent, change to a darker color, and become covered\r\nwith a number of little elevations. Subsequently, numerous mottled\r\npatches, or round spots of a whitish hue, scatter themselves over the\r\nouter part of this circle.\r\n\r\nThe time at which these changes make their appearance is variable. They\r\nmay begin to develope themselves in two or three weeks, oftener not\r\nuntil the second or third month, and in women of a delicate build,\r\nsometimes not until the latter end of pregnancy. Occasionally no\r\nalteration whatever occurs in the breasts until after confinement, in\r\nwhich cases the secretion of milk is delayed for several days after the\r\nbirth of the child. In some rare instances the breasts never assume\r\nmaternal proportions, and the mother is debarred from the pleasure and\r\nduty of nursing her own child.\r\n\r\n4. _Quickening_ is the next symptom we will consider. By this term is\r\nmeant the arrival of that time when the mother first becomes conscious\r\nby the movements of the child of its presence. The ancients thought that\r\nthen life was imparted to the new being. Modern physiology emphatically\r\ncondemns this absurdity. The embryo is as much alive in the very\r\nearliest moments of pregnancy as at any future stage of its existence.\r\nLet every woman therefore remember that she who produces abortion is\r\nequally guilty in the eyes of science and of Heaven, whether the act be\r\ncommitted before or after the period of quickening.\r\n\r\nHow is quickening produced? Undoubtedly by the movements of the child.\r\nSo soon as its nervous and muscular systems become sufficiently\r\ndeveloped to enable it to move its limbs, the mother, if the movements\r\nbe sufficiently active, is rendered sensible of her situation. But the\r\nmuscular contractions may not be strong enough to impart any sensation\r\nto the mother. In many cases in which they are too feeble to be noticed\r\nby herself, the skilled accoucheur is capable of recognizing them. And\r\nthe movements of the foetus may be excited in various ways known to\r\nphysicians.\r\n\r\n_Time of quickening._--This symptom usually occurs about the middle of\r\npregnancy, near the eighteenth week. Some women feel the movements of\r\nthe foetus as early as the third month of pregnancy, others not till the\r\nsixth month. Cases occur in which no movement whatever is felt until the\r\neighth or ninth month, or even not at all. It has been suggested that a\r\nfoetus which does not indicate its presence in this way is a kind of\r\n'Lazy Lawrence,' too indolent to move. Certainly, many of both sexes\r\nexhibit after birth such indomitable love of repose, that it can readily\r\nbe supposed they were equally passive in foetal life.\r\n\r\nThe non-occurrence of this sign may, however, be due to the debility of\r\nthe young child, or to a want of sensibility in the walls of the womb\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nA woman may be deceived, and suppose she has quickened, when her\r\nsensations are to be traced to flatulence of the bowels, or perhaps a\r\ndropsical effusion. Many ludicrous instances of self-deception are on\r\nrecord. The historian Hume states that Queen Mary, in her extreme desire\r\nto have issue, so confidently asserted that she felt the movements of\r\nthe child, that public proclamation was made of the interesting event.\r\nDespatches were sent to foreign courts; national rejoicings were had;\r\nthe sex of the child was settled, for everybody was certain it was going\r\nto be a male; and Bonner, Bishop of London, made public prayers, saying\r\nthat Heaven would pledge to make him beautiful, vigorous, and witty. But\r\nall those high hopes and eager expectations were destined never to be\r\nrealized. The future disclosed that the supposed quickening was merely a\r\nconsequence of disordered health, and commencing dropsy.\r\n\r\nSome women possess the power of imitating the movements of a foetus, by\r\nvoluntary contraction of the abdominal muscles. A well-known colored\r\nwoman of Charleston, 'Aunt Betty,' had a great reputation as having\r\n'been pregnant for fifteen years.' She made a good deal of money, by\r\nexhibiting to physicians and medical students who were curious, the\r\npretended movements of her unborn child. She was repeatedly presented to\r\nthe medical classes in the city. No pregnancy existed, as was revealed\r\nby a _post-mortem_ examination. She imposed upon the credulous by the\r\nhabit she had acquired of jerking her muscles at pleasure, and thus\r\nclosely simulating the movements of an embryo.\r\n\r\n5. _Changes in the abdomen._--In the first two months of pregnancy the\r\nabdomen is _less_ prominent than usual: it recedes, and presents a flat\r\nappearance. The navel is also drawn in and depressed. About the third\r\nmonth a swelling frequently shows itself in the lower part of the\r\nabdomen, and then diminishes, thus leading the wife to suppose that she\r\nwas mistaken in her condition, for she finds herself at the fourth month\r\nsmaller than at the third. After this, however, there is a gradual\r\nincrease in the size and hardness of the abdomen. What is of more value,\r\nis the peculiar form of the swelling. It is pear-shaped, and is thus\r\ndistinguished from the swelling of dropsy and other affections. The\r\nnavel begins to come forward, and finally protrudes. The pouting\r\nappearance it then presents is very characteristic.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be remarked that, towards the change of life,\r\nchildless married women often think they perceive that 'hope deferred'\r\nis about to be gratified. An enlargement of the abdomen takes place at\r\nthis time, from a deposit of fatty matter. The nervous perturbations and\r\nthe cessation of the menses, which are natural to this period, are\r\nlooked upon as confirmations of the opinion that pregnancy exists. But\r\nthe day of generation with them has passed. These symptoms herald the\r\napproach of the winter of life, which brings with it death to the\r\nreproductive system.\r\n\r\n6. _Changes in the skin._--The alterations occurring in the skin are\r\nworth observing. Those women who have a delicate complexion and are\r\nnaturally pale take a high color, and vice versâ. In some cases a\r\nconsiderable quantity of hair appears on those parts of the face\r\noccupied by the beard in men; it disappears after labor, and returns on\r\nevery subsequent pregnancy. Oftentimes the skin becomes loose and\r\nwrinkled, giving a haggard, aged air to the face, and spoiling good\r\nlooks. Women who ordinarily perspire freely, have now a dry, rough skin;\r\nwhereas those whose skin is not naturally moist, have copious\r\nperspiration, which may be of a peculiarly strong odor. Copper-colored\r\nor yellow blotches sometimes appear upon the skin, mole spots become\r\ndarker and larger, and a dark ring developes itself beneath the eyes.\r\nThe whole appearance is thus in many cases altered. On the other hand,\r\nobstinate, long-existing skin affections sometimes take their departure\r\nduring pregnancy, perhaps never to return. These alterations do not\r\noccur in all women, nor in all pregnancies of the same woman.\r\n\r\n7. We may now group together a number of less important and less\r\nconstant signs, such as _depraved appetite_, _longings for unnatural\r\nfood_, _excessive formation of saliva in the mouth_, _heartburn, loss of\r\nappetite_ in the first two or three months, succeeded by a voracious\r\ndesire for food, which sometimes compels the woman to rise at night in\r\norder to eat, _toothache_, _sleepiness_, _diarrhoea_, _palpitation of the\r\nheart_, _pain in the right side_, etc. These, when they occur singly,\r\nare of little value as evidence.\r\n\r\nAmong these, that of _depraved appetite_ is by far the most important,\r\nand may be regarded as quite significant. A married woman in her\r\nordinary health, suddenly feeling this morbid taste for chalk, charcoal,\r\nslate pencil, and other unusual articles of food, may look upon it as a\r\nstrong presumptive evidence of impregnation.\r\n\r\nWhen any or all of this group of symptoms accompany the ceasing to be\r\n'regular,' the morning sickness, the changes in the breasts and the\r\nother signs which have been enumerated, the wife may be quite sure that\r\nshe is pregnant.\r\n\r\n8. _Changes in the mind._--The most wonderful of all the changes which\r\nattend pregnancy are those in the nervous system. The woman is rendered\r\nmore susceptible, more impressible. Her character is transformed. She is\r\nno longer pleasant, confiding, gentle, and gay. She becomes hasty,\r\npassionate, jealous, and bitter. But in those who are naturally fretful\r\nand bad-tempered a change for the better is sometimes observed, so that\r\nthe members of the household learn from experience to hail with delight\r\nthe mother's pregnancy as a period when clouds and storms give place to\r\nsunshine and quietness. In some rare cases, also, pregnancy confers\r\nincreased force and elevation to the ideas, and augmented power to the\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nAs this book is written for women only, we do not mention any of the\r\nsigns or symptoms of pregnancy which medical men alone can recognize. We\r\nwill merely state that there are many other signs besides these referred\r\nto, of great value to the doctor. One, the sound of the heart of the\r\nchild, which the practised ear can detect at about the fifth month, is\r\npositive and conclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nMiscarriage is a fruitful source of disease, and often of danger, to\r\nwives. It also causes a frightful waste of human life. Unborn thousands\r\nannually die in this manner.\r\n\r\n_Frequency._--Miscarriage is by no means a rare occurrence. Statistics\r\nshow that thirty-seven out of one hundred mothers miscarry before they\r\nattain the age of thirty years. But this accident is much more apt to\r\noccur during the latter than during the first half of the child-bearing\r\nperiod; and therefore it is estimated that ninety out of one hundred of\r\nall women who continue in matrimony until the change of life, miscarry.\r\n\r\n_Influence of age of mother._--A woman who marries at forty is very much\r\ndisposed to miscarry; whereas, had she married at thirty, she might have\r\nborne children when older than forty. As a mother approaches the end of\r\nher child-bearing period, it is likely that she will terminate her\r\ncareer of fertility with a premature birth. The last pregnancies are not\r\nonly most commonly unsuccessful, but there is also reason to believe\r\nthat the occurrence of idiocy in a child may be associated with the\r\ncircumstance of its being the last-born of its mother. It has been\r\nasserted, in this connection, that men of genius are frequently the\r\nfirst-born. First pregnancies are also fraught with the danger of\r\nmiscarriage, which occurs more often in them than in others, excepting\r\nthe latest. A woman is particularly apt to miscarry with her first\r\nchild, if she be either exceedingly nervous or full-blooded.\r\n\r\n_Influence of period of pregnancy._--Miscarriage is most frequent in the\r\nearlier months of pregnancy--from the first to the third. It is also\r\nvery prone to happen about the sixth month. Habit makes itself felt\r\nhere; for women who have many times experienced this sad accident,\r\nencounter it nearly always at the same epoch of their pregnancy.\r\n\r\n_How early can the child live?_--The infant is incapable, as a rule, of\r\nan independent existence, if brought into the world before the end of\r\nthe sixth month. The law of France regards a child born one hundred and\r\neighty days after wedlock as not only capable of living, but as\r\nlegitimate and worthy of all legal and civil rights. There are many\r\ncases mentioned, by the older medical writers, of children born previous\r\nto this period living. One of the most curious is that recorded by Van\r\nSwieten. The boy Fortunio Liceti was brought into the world before the\r\nsixth month, in consequence of a fright his mother had at sea. When\r\nborn, it is said, he was the size of a hand, and his father placed him\r\nin an oven, for the purpose, probably, it has been suggested, of making\r\nhim _rise_. Although born prematurely, he died late, for we are told\r\nthat he attained his seventy-ninth year. Professor Gunning S. Bedford of\r\nNew York records the case of a woman in her fourth confinement, who,\r\nbefore she had completed her sixth month, was delivered of a female\r\ninfant weighing two pounds nine ounces. The surface of the body was of a\r\nscarlet hue. It breathed, and in a short time after birth cried freely.\r\nAfter being wrapped in soft cotton, well lubricated with warm sweet-oil,\r\nit was fed with the mother's milk, by having a few drops at a time put\r\ninto its mouth. At first it had great difficulty in swallowing, but\r\ngradually it succeeded in taking sufficient nourishment, and is now a\r\nvigorous, healthy young woman.\r\n\r\n_Dangers to mother._--Wives are too much in the habit of making light of\r\nmiscarriages. They are much more frequently followed by disease of the\r\nwomb than are confinements at full terms. There is a greater amount of\r\ninjury done to the parts than in natural labor. While after confinement\r\nample time is afforded by a long period of repose for the bruised and\r\nlacerated parts to heal, after a miscarriage no such rest is obtained.\r\nMenstruation soon returns; conception may quickly follow. Unhappily,\r\nthere is no custom requiring husband and wife to sleep apart for a month\r\nafter a miscarriage, as there is after a confinement. Hence, especially\r\nif there be any pre-existing uterine disease, or a predisposition\r\nthereto, miscarriage is a serious thing.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The irritation of hemorrhoids or straining at stool will\r\nsometimes provoke an early expulsion of a child. Excessive intercourse\r\nby the newly married is a very frequent cause. Bathing in the ocean has\r\nbeen known to produce it. Nursing is exceedingly apt to do so. It has\r\nbeen shown by a distinguished medical writer, that, in a given number of\r\ninstances, miscarriage occurred in seventeen per cent. of cases in which\r\nthe woman conceived while nursing, and in only ten per cent. where\r\nconception occurred at some other time. A wife, therefore, who suspects\r\nherself to be pregnant, should wean her child. The extraction of a\r\ntooth, over-exertion and over-excitement, a fall, a blow, any violent\r\nemotion, such as anger, sudden and excessive joy, or fright, running,\r\ndancing, horseback exercise, or riding in a badly-built carriage over a\r\nrough road, great fatigue, lifting heavy weights, the abuse of purgative\r\nmedicines, disease or displacement of the womb, small-pox, or a general\r\ncondition of ill-health, are all fruitful and well-known exciting causes\r\nof this unfortunate mishap, in addition to those which have been before\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--The eminent practitioner, Dr. Tilt, says, 'The way to\r\nprevent miscarriage is to lead a quiet life, particularly during those\r\ndays of each successive month when, under other circumstances, the woman\r\nwould menstruate; and to abstain during those days not only from long\r\nwalks and parties, but also from sexual intercourse.'\r\n\r\nIt is especially desirable to avoid a miscarriage in the first\r\npregnancy, for fear that the habit of miscarrying shall then be set up,\r\nwhich it will be very difficult to eradicate. Therefore newly-married\r\nwomen should carefully avoid all causes which are known to induce the\r\npremature expulsion of the child. If it should take place in spite of\r\nall precautions, extraordinary care should be exercised in the\r\nsubsequent pregnancy, to prevent its recurrence. Professor Bedford of\r\nNew York has said he has found that an excellent expedient in such cases\r\nis, as soon as pregnancy is known to exist, 'to interdict sexual\r\nintercourse until after the fifth month; for if the pregnancy pass\r\nbeyond this period, the chances of miscarriage will be much diminished.'\r\n\r\nIf the _symptoms of miscarriage_, which may be expressed in the two\r\nwords _pain_ and _flooding_, should make their appearance, the doctor\r\nought at once to be sent for, the wife awaiting his arrival in a\r\nrecumbent position. He may even then be able to avert the impending\r\ndanger. At any rate, his services are as necessary, and often even more\r\nso, as in a labor at full term.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTHER'S MARKS.\r\n\r\nIt is a popular belief that the imagination of the mother affects the\r\nchild in the womb. It is asserted that infants are often born with\r\nvarious marks and deformities corresponding in character with objects\r\nwhich had made a vivid impression on the maternal mind during pregnancy.\r\nThis is a subject of great practical interest. We shall therefore give\r\nit the careful attention which it deserves.\r\n\r\nWe have already discussed the operation of the laws of inheritance. It\r\nwas then stated that the whole story of maternal influence had not been\r\ntold--that the mother could communicate qualities she never possessed.\r\nThe potency of imagination at the time of conception over the child has\r\nbeen mentioned. It is now our design to consider its effects, during the\r\nperiod of pregnancy, upon the physical structure and the mental\r\nattributes of the offspring. We shall have occasion hereafter, in\r\nspeaking of nursing, to illustrate the manner in which the child may be\r\naffected by maternal impressions acting through the mother's milk. What\r\ncan be more wonderful than this intimate union between the mother and\r\nher child? It is only equaled by that mysterious influence of the\r\nhusband over the wife, by which he so impresses her system that she\r\noften comes in time to resemble him both in mental and physical\r\ncharacteristics, and even transmits his peculiarities to her children by\r\na second marriage. Father, mother, and child are one.\r\n\r\nWe wish here to premise that our remarks will be based upon the\r\nconclusions of skilled and scientific observers only, whose position and\r\nexperience no medical man will question. All the instances to be related\r\nare given upon unimpeachable authority. They are not the narrations of\r\nignorant, credulous people; they are all fully vouched for. We record\r\nhere, as elsewhere, only the sober utterances of science. The great\r\nimportance and utility of an acquaintance with them will be patent to\r\nevery intelligent man and woman.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the mind upon the body is well known. Strong,\r\nlong-continued mental emotion may induce or cure disease. Heart disease\r\nmay be produced by a morbid direction of the thoughts to that organ.\r\nWarts disappear under the operation of a strong belief in the efficacy\r\nof some nonsensical application. In olden time, scrofula, or the 'king's\r\nevil', was cured by the touch of the king. The mind of the patient, of\r\ncourse, accomplished the cure. Under the influence of profound mental\r\nemotion, the hair of the beautiful Marie Antoinette became white in a\r\nshort time. During the solitary voyage of Madame Condamine down the wild\r\nand lonely Amazon, a similar change took place. Many other instances\r\nmight be adduced; but those given are sufficient to show that strong and\r\npersistent mental impressions will exert a mysterious transforming power\r\nover the body. These facts will pave the way to the consideration of\r\ncorresponding effects, through the mother's mind, upon the development\r\nof the unborn child, forming a part of herself _in utero._\r\n\r\n_Influence of mind of mother on form and color of infant._--There are\r\nnumerous facts on record which prove that _habitual_, long-continued\r\nmental conditions of the mother at an early period of pregnancy, induce\r\ndeformity or other abnormal development of the infant.\r\n\r\nProfessor William A. Hammond of New York relates the following striking\r\ncase, which occurred in his own experience, and which scarcely admits of\r\na doubt as to the influence of the maternal mind over the physical\r\nstructure of the foetus.\r\n\r\nA lady in the third month of her pregnancy was very much horrified by\r\nher husband being brought home one evening with a severe wound of the\r\nface, from which the blood was streaming. The shock to her was so great\r\nthat she fainted, and subsequently had a hysterical attack, during which\r\nshe was under Dr. Hammond's care. Soon after her recovery she told him\r\nthat she was afraid her child would be affected in some way, and that\r\neven then she could not get rid of the impression the sight of her\r\nhusband's bloody face had made upon her. In due time the child, a girl,\r\nwas born. She had a dark red mark upon the face, corresponding in\r\nsituation and extent with that which had been upon her father's face.\r\nShe also proved to be idiotic.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dalton of New York states that the wife of the janitor of the\r\nCollege of Physicians and Surgeons of that city, during her pregnancy,\r\ndreamed that she saw a man who had lost a part of the ear. The dream\r\nmade a great impression upon her mind, and she mentioned it to her\r\nhusband. When her child was born, a portion of one ear was deficient,\r\nand the organ was exactly like the defective ear she had seen in her\r\ndream. When Professor Dalton was lecturing upon the development of the\r\nfoetus as affected by the mind of the mother, the janitor called his\r\nattention to the foregoing instance. The ear looks exactly as if a\r\nportion had been cut off with a sharp knife.\r\n\r\nProfessor J. Lewis Smith of Bellevue Hospital Medical College, New York,\r\nhas met with the following cases:--An Irishwoman, of strong emotions and\r\nsuperstitions, was passing along a street, in the first months of her\r\npregnancy, when she was accosted by a beggar, who raised her hand,\r\ndestitute of thumb and fingers, and in 'God's name' asked for alms. The\r\nwoman passed on, but, reflecting in whose name money was asked, felt\r\nthat she had committed a great sin in refusing assistance. She returned\r\nto the place where she had met the beggar, and on different days, but\r\nnever afterwards saw her. Harassed by the thought of her imaginary sin,\r\nso that for weeks, according to her statement, she was distressed by it,\r\nshe approached her confinement. A female infant was born, otherwise\r\nperfect, but lacking the fingers and thumb of one hand. The deformed\r\nlimb was on the same side, and it seemed to the mother to resemble\r\nprecisely that of the beggar. In another case which Professor Smith met,\r\na very similar malformation was attributed by the mother of the child to\r\nan accident occurring, during the time of her pregnancy, to a near\r\nrelative, which necessitated amputation. He examined both of these\r\nchildren with defective limbs, and has no doubt of the truthfulness of\r\nthe parents. In May, 1868, he removed a supernumerary thumb from an\r\ninfant, whose mother, a baker's wife, gave the following history:--No\r\none of the family, and no ancestor, to her knowledge, presented this\r\ndeformity. In the early months of her pregnancy she sold bread from the\r\ncounter, and nearly every day a child with a double thumb came in for a\r\npenny roll, presenting the penny between the thumb and the finger. After\r\nthe third month she left the bakery, but the malformation was so\r\nimpressed upon her mind, that she was not surprised to see it reproduced\r\nin her infant.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases the impression was produced in the early months of\r\npregnancy; but many have been recorded in which malformations in the\r\ninfant appeared distinctly traceable to strong mental emotions of the\r\nmother only a few months previous to confinement, these impressions\r\nhaving been persistent during the remaining period of the pregnancy, and\r\ngiving rise to a full expectation on the part of the mother that the\r\nchild would be affected in the particular manner which actually\r\noccurred. Professor Carpenter, the distinguished physiologist, is\r\npersonally cognisant of a very striking case of the kind which occurred\r\nin the family of a near connection of his own.\r\n\r\nAll the above instances have been those of the effects of persistent\r\nmental emotion. But it is also true that _violent and sudden emotion_ in\r\nthe mother leaves sometimes its impress upon the unborn infant, although\r\nit may be quickly forgotten.\r\n\r\nIt is related on good authority that a lady, who during her pregnancy\r\nwas struck with the unpleasant view of leeches applied to a relative's\r\nfoot, gave birth to a child with the mark of a leech coiled up in the\r\nact of suction on the intended spot.\r\n\r\nDr. Delacoux of Paris says that, in the month of January 1825, he was\r\ncalled to attend a woman in the village of Batignoles, near Paris, who\r\nthe evening before had been delivered of a six months' foetus, horribly\r\ndeformed. The upper lip was in a confused mass with the jaw and the\r\ngums, and the right leg was amputated at the middle, the stump having\r\nthe form of a cone. The mother of this being, who was a cook, one\r\nmorning, about the third month of her pregnancy, on entering the house\r\nwhere she was employed, was seized with horror at the sight of a porter\r\nwith a hare-lip and an amputated leg.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Society of Physicians at Berlin, in August 1868,\r\nHerr Dupré stated that a woman saw, in the first weeks of her third\r\npregnancy, a boy with a hare-lip; and not only was the child she then\r\ncarried born with a frightful hare-lip, but also three children\r\nsubsequently. Another one, a woman in the fifth week of pregnancy, saw a\r\nsheep wounded, and with its bowels protruding. She was greatly shocked,\r\nand did not recover her composure for several days. She was delivered at\r\nterm of a child, in other respects well developed, but lacking the walls\r\nof the abdomen.\r\n\r\nMany remarkable instances have been collected of the power of\r\n_imagination_ over the unborn offspring.\r\n\r\nAmbrose Paré, the illustrious French surgeon of the sixteenth century,\r\nin one of his treatises devotes a chapter to the subject of 'monsters\r\nwhich take their cause and shape from imagination,' and was evidently a\r\nstrong believer in this influence.\r\n\r\nA black child is generally believed to have been born to Marie Thérèse,\r\nthe wife of Louis XIV., in consequence of a little negro page in her\r\nservice having started from a hiding-place and stumbled over her dress\r\nearly in her pregnancy. This child was educated at the convent of Moret,\r\nnear Fontainebleau, where she took the veil, and where, till the shock\r\nof the Revolution, her portrait was shown.\r\n\r\nExamples are given by authors of the force of _desires_ in causing\r\ndeformities in infants, and the formation upon them of fruits, such as\r\napples, pears, grapes, and others, which the mother may have longed for.\r\n\r\nThe following is related upon excellent medical authority:--A woman gave\r\nbirth to a child with a large cluster of globular tumours growing from\r\nthe tongue, and preventing the closure of the mouth, in color, shape,\r\nand size exactly resembling our common grapes; and with a red\r\nexcrescence from the chest, as exactly resembling in figure and\r\nappearance a turkey's wattles. On being questioned before the child was\r\nshown to her, she answered, that while pregnant she had seen some\r\ngrapes, longed intensely for them, and constantly thought of them; and\r\nthat she was also once attacked and much alarmed by a turkey-cock.\r\n\r\nDr. Demangeon of Paris quotes, in his work on the Imagination, the\r\n_Journal de Verdun_, as mentioning the case of a child, born at Blois,\r\nin the eyes of which the face of a watch was distinctly seen. The image\r\nwas situated around the pupil, and the figures representing the hours\r\nwere plainly perceived. The mother had experienced a strong desire to\r\nsee a watch while she was pregnant with this child.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dalton says, in his _Human Physiology_, that 'there is now\r\nlittle room for doubt that various deformities and deficiencies of the\r\nfoetus, conformably to the popular belief, do really originate in certain\r\ncases from nervous impressions, such as disgust, fear, or anger,\r\nexperienced by the mother.' We will now consider the\r\n\r\n_Influence of the mind of the mother on the mind of the infant_; which\r\nsubject we have not yet touched upon, having confined ourselves to the\r\ninfluence of the maternal mind over the form and color of the unborn\r\nchild. It will not be necessary to illustrate at length this branch of\r\nour topic. Instances are sufficiently common and well known. Dr. Seguin\r\nof New York, in his work on Idiocy, gives several cases in which there\r\nwas reason to believe that fright, anxiety, or other emotions in the\r\nmother, had produced idiocy in the offspring. As he remarks,\r\n'Impressions will sometimes reach the foetus in its recess, cut off its\r\nlegs or arms, or inflict large flesh wounds before birth,--inexplicable\r\nas well as indisputable facts, from which we surmise that idiocy holds\r\nunknown though certain relations to maternal impressions.'\r\n\r\nWe have given many strong cases and most excellent authority for the\r\ndoctrine that the _purely mental_ influence of the mother may produce\r\nbodily and mental changes in the unborn infant. But the child is also\r\naffected by _physical impressions_ made upon the mother.\r\n\r\nDr. Russegger reports that a woman, who had already borne four healthy\r\nchildren, was, in the seventh month of her pregnancy, bitten in the\r\nright calf by a dog. The author saw the wound made by the animal's\r\nteeth, which wound consisted of three small triangular depressions, by\r\ntwo of which the skin was only slightly ruffled; a slight appearance of\r\nblood was perceptible in the third. The woman was at the moment of the\r\naccident somewhat alarmed, but neither then nor afterwards had any fear\r\nthat her foetus would be affected by the occurrence. Ten weeks after she\r\nwas bitten, the woman bore a healthy child, which, however, to the\r\nsurprise of every person, had three marks corresponding in size and\r\nappearance to those caused by the dog's teeth in the mother's leg, and\r\nconsisting, like those, of one large and two smaller impressions. The\r\ntwo latter, which were pale, disappeared in five weeks; the larger one\r\nhad also become less, and was not so deep colored as it was at birth. At\r\nthe time of writing, the child was four months old.\r\n\r\nDr. S. P. Crawford of Greenville, Tennessee, reports in a recent number\r\nof the _Nashville Journal of Medicine_, the following sad case:--A lady,\r\nin the last stage of pregnancy, was burned by the explosion of a\r\nkerosene-oil can. She lived twelve hours after the accident. The face,\r\nlegs, arms, and abdomen were badly burned. The movements of the child\r\nwere felt three or four hours after the accident. A short time before\r\nthe death of the mother she gave birth to the child at full maturity,\r\nbut still-born. It bore the mark of the fire corresponding to that of\r\nthe mother. Its legs, arms, and abdomen were completely blistered,\r\nhaving all the appearance of a recent burn.\r\n\r\nThese instances of a decided influence exerted upon the body and mind of\r\nthe child in the womb, by physical and mental impressions made upon the\r\nmother, might be doubled or trebled. They are as numerous as they are\r\nwonderful. Physiologists of the present day do not hesitate to admit the\r\nexistence of the influence we have been discussing. Reason also comes to\r\nthe support of facts, to demonstrate and establish its reality. For, if\r\na sudden and powerful emotion of the mind can so disturb the stomach and\r\nheart as to cause vomiting and fainting, is it not probable that it can\r\naffect the womb and the impressible being within it? Pregnancy is a\r\nfunction of the woman as much as digestion or pulsation of the heart;\r\nand if the latter are controlled by moral and mental impressions, why\r\nshould not the former be also?\r\n\r\n_In what manner does this influence of the maternal mind act?_--Through\r\nthe blood of the mother. Only a very delicate membrane separates the\r\nvital fluid of the mother from that of the infant in her womb. There is\r\na constant interchange of the blood in its body with that in hers\r\nthrough this exceedingly thin membrane; and thus all nervous impressions\r\nwhich have produced an alteration of either a temporary or permanent\r\ncharacter in the circulating fluid of the mother, are communicated to\r\nthe child. Since the mother, as has been shown, can transmit through her\r\nblood certain characteristics of mind and body not her own,--for\r\ninstance, a disease peculiar to a male from her father to her son, or\r\nthe physical and mental traits of her first husband to the children by\r\nher second,--it does not seem at all strange that she should through\r\nthis same medium, her blood, impart other peculiarities which have made\r\na strong impression upon her mind. Anatomy and physiology therefore\r\nfully explain and account for this seemingly mysterious influence.\r\n\r\nThe view here stated, and indorsed by modern science, is one which ought\r\nto have great weight with the mother, her relatives and friends. The\r\n_practical conclusion_ which it suggests is, that as during pregnancy\r\nthere is unusual susceptibility to mental impressions, and as these\r\nimpressions may operate on the fragile structure of the unborn being,\r\nthis tendency should be well considered and constantly remembered, not\r\nonly by the woman herself, but by all those who associate or are thrown\r\nin contact with her. Upon the care displayed in the management of the\r\ncorporeal and mental health of the mother during the whole period of\r\npregnancy, the ultimate constitution of the offspring greatly depends.\r\nAll the surroundings and employments of the pregnant woman should be\r\nsuch as conduce to cheerfulness and equanimity. Above all, she should\r\navoid the presence of disagreeable and unsightly objects. Vivid and\r\nunpleasant impressions should be removed as soon as possible by quiet\r\ndiversion of the mind. All causes of excitement should be carefully\r\nguarded against.\r\n\r\nIn leaving the subject of maternal impressions, we will call attention\r\nto the manifest difference in extent and degree between the influence of\r\nthe father and that of the mother over the offspring. That of the father\r\nceases with impregnation. That of the mother continues during the whole\r\nterm of pregnancy, and, as we shall shortly see, even during that of\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION OF THE CHILD IN THE WOMB.\r\n\r\nThe outlines drawn by the artist Flaxman are esteemed the most perfect\r\nand graceful in existence. From earliest childhood he manifested a\r\ndelight in drawing. His mother, a woman of refined and artistic tastes,\r\nused to relate that for months previous to his birth she spent hours\r\ndaily studying engravings, and fixing in her memory the most beautiful\r\nproportions of the human figure as portrayed by masters. She was\r\nconvinced that the genius of her son was the fruit of her own\r\nself-culture. What a charming idea is this! What an incentive to those\r\nabout to become mothers, to cultivate refinement, high thoughts, pure\r\nemotions, elevated sentiments! Thus they endow their children with what\r\nno after education can give them.\r\n\r\nThe plastic brain of the foetus is prompt to receive all impressions. It\r\nretains them, and they become the characteristics of the child and the\r\nman. Low spirits, violent passions, irritability, frivolity, in the\r\npregnant woman, leave indelible marks on the unborn child. So do their\r\ncontraries; and thus it becomes of the utmost moment that during this\r\nperiod all that is cheerful, inspiring, and elevating should surround\r\nthe woman. Such emotions educate the child: they form its disposition,\r\nthey shape its faculties, they create its mental and intellectual\r\ntraits. Of all education, this is the most momentous.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAN A WOMAN BECOME AGAIN PREGNANT DURING PREGNANCY?\r\n\r\nCan a woman during pregnancy conceive, and add a second and younger\r\nchild to that already in the womb?\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon in the canine race for a mother to give birth at the\r\nsame time to dogs of different species, showing conclusively the\r\npossibility, in these animals, of one conception closely following\r\nanother. So a mare has been known to produce within a quarter of an\r\nhour, first a horse, and then a mule. And in the human race cases are\r\non record in which women have had twins, of which the one was white and\r\nthe other colored, in consequence of intercourse on the same day with\r\nmen of those two races. Dr. Henry relates that in Brazil a Creole woman,\r\na native, brought into the world at one birth three children of three\r\ndifferent colors,--white, brown, and black,--each child exhibiting the\r\nfeatures peculiar to the respective races.\r\n\r\nIn all such instances the two conceptions followed each other very\r\nrapidly, the offspring arriving at maturity together, and being born at\r\nthe same accouchement. But more curious and wonderful examples of second\r\nand concurrent pregnancies have been published than these--as, for\r\ninstance, those in which a child bearing all the attributes of a foetus\r\nat full term is born two, three, four, and even five, months after the\r\nfirst, which appeared also to have been born at full term. Marie Anne\r\nBigaud, aged thirty-seven, gave birth, April 30, 1748, to a living boy\r\nat full term, and on the ensuing September 16, to a living girl, which\r\nwas recognised, by the size and well-developed condition of its body and\r\nlimbs, to have been also carried until full term. This fact was observed\r\nby Professor Eisenman, and by Leriche, surgeon-major of the military\r\nhospital of Strasbourg. It will be noticed that there was an interval of\r\nfour and a half months between the two accouchements. The first child\r\nlived two and a half months, and the second a year. In this instance\r\nthere was not a double womb, as might perhaps be supposed, for after\r\nthe mother's death an examination proved that the uterus was single.\r\n\r\nAnother case of this kind is the following:--Benoite Franquet of Lyons\r\nbrought into the world a girl on January 20, 1780, and five months and\r\nsix days afterwards a second girl, also apparently at term, and well\r\nnourished. Two years later these two children were presented, with their\r\ncertificates of baptism, to two notaries of Lyons, MM. Caillot and\r\nDesurgey, in order that the fact might be placed on record and vouched\r\nfor, because of its value in legal medicine.\r\n\r\nThe number of the entirely authenticated cases now known of the birth of\r\nfully developed children within from two to five months of each other,\r\ncan leave no doubt as to the possibility of such an occurrence. The only\r\nquestion which remains is in regard to the periods of conception. Are\r\nthe two children in such cases twins, conceived at the same time, but\r\nthe growth of the last-born so retarded that it did not arrive at\r\nmaturity until a number of months after its fellow? or, Has a second\r\nconception taken place at an interval of several months after the first?\r\nIf this latter view be true, then, in the instance of Marie Anne Bigaud,\r\nabove related, the second child must have been conceived after the first\r\nhad quickened. Then, also, two children of different ages, the offspring\r\nof different fathers, may exist in the womb at the same time. The weight\r\nof scientific observation and authority has now established the fact\r\nthat, in very rare instances, a second conception may take place during\r\npregnancy. It must not be understood as necessarily following from this\r\nstatement, that when two children are born at the same time,--one fully\r\ndeveloped, and the other small and apparently prematurely born,--the two\r\nwere conceived at different times. The smaller may have been blighted\r\nand its growth hindered by the same causes which bring about such\r\neffects in cases of single births of incompletely developed children. A\r\nsimilar supposition may account for the birth of a second child within a\r\nmonth or two after the first, for the first may have been prematurely\r\nborn, and the second carried to full term. But no such supposition can\r\nexplain the cases referred to, and others which might be mentioned, in\r\nwhich the interval has been five or six months, each child presenting\r\nevery indication of perfect maturity. The only explanation possible in\r\nsuch instances, which, as has been said, are well authenticated,\r\nalthough few in number, is, that a second pregnancy has occurred during\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nThe above facts would seem sufficiently wonderful. There are others,\r\nhowever, of the same nature still more so. In some instances, the\r\nproduct of the second conception, instead of developing independently of\r\nthe first, has become attached to it, and the phenomenon has been\r\npresented of the growth of a child within a child--a foetus within a\r\nfoetus. Such a singular occurrence has been lately recorded in a German\r\njournal. A correspondent of the _Dantzic Gazette_ states that on Sunday,\r\nFebruary 1, 1869, at Schliewen, near Dirschau, 'a young and blooming\r\nshepherd's wife was delivered of a girl, otherwise sound, but having on\r\nthe lower part of her back, between the hips, a swelling as big as two\r\ngood-sized fists, through the walls of which a well-developed foetus may\r\nbe felt. Its limbs indicate a growth of from five to six months, and its\r\nmovements are very lively. The father called in the health commissioner,\r\nDr. Preuss, from Dirschau, and begged him to remove the swelling\r\ntogether with the foetus. The doctor, however, after a careful\r\nexamination, declared that there was a possibility in this extraordinary\r\ncase of the child within the swelling coming to fruition. Its existence\r\nand active motions were palpable to all present. No physician could be\r\njustified in destroying this marvelous being. It ought rather to be\r\nprotected and cherished. The new-born girl, notwithstanding her strange\r\nburden, is of unusual strength and beauty, and takes the breast very\r\ncheerfully.'\r\n\r\nWe find something further in regard to this singular birth in the _Weser\r\nZeitung_ of February 20, 1869. It quotes from the _Dantzic Gazette_ some\r\nremarks by the health commissioner, Dr. Preuss of Dirschau, in which the\r\ndoctor declares the facts contained in the report given above to be\r\ncorrect. He was summoned on the 1st of February to the child, and saw\r\nthe vigorous movements, and felt the members of a foetus within the\r\nswelling, as described. It was evidently a double creation. The case\r\nthus far, though rare, is not unique. 'But what is novel, and hitherto\r\nperfectly unnoticed in medical literature, is the fact that not only the\r\ngirl, which has been carried its full term, is alive to-day, but the\r\nfoetus within the swelling has also, in the eleven days after birth,\r\nfurther developed, and palpably increased in size. The swelling is now\r\nfour and a half inches long, three and a half inches wide, and high and\r\npear-shaped; the head lies underneath on the left, the body towards the\r\nright.'\r\n\r\nFurther particulars and the latest intelligence we have concerning the\r\nprogress of this case are to the effect that the child was brought by\r\nspecial request before the Natural History Society of Dantzic, and\r\nthence the mother went to Berlin for medical advice.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORAL ASPECTS OF THIS QUESTION.\r\n\r\nUpon proper judgment and discrimination in the application of the facts\r\nwe have just been dwelling upon, may depend a wife's honor, and the\r\nhappiness of the dearest social relations. We will suppose an example. A\r\nhusband, immediately after the impregnation of his wife, is obliged to\r\nquit her, and remains absent a year. In the meanwhile she gives birth to\r\ntwo children, at an interval of a number of weeks. The question will\r\nthen come up, Whether, under such circumstances, it is possible for her\r\nto do so consistently with conjugal purity.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that, in speaking of twins, we remarked that it\r\nwas not very uncommon for an interval of days or weeks to elapse between\r\nthe births, and it has just been stated that impregnation during\r\npregnancy is extremely rare. The presumption, therefore, in the case\r\nsupposed, is as very many to one that the two births were the result of\r\na twin pregnancy. In the absence of any other evidence against the\r\nwife's chastity, it should not even be called in question. This decision\r\nreceives the support of the maxim in law that a reasonable doubt is the\r\nproperty of the accused, and of the Christian principle that it is\r\nbetter that ninety-nine guilty should escape than that one innocent\r\nshould be condemned. Hence the teachings of science and of human and\r\ndivine law all coincide to protect the sacred rights and the precious\r\ninterests at stake against an unjust suspicion, which even the doctrine\r\nof chances would render untenable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAN A CHILD CRY IN THE WOMB?\r\n\r\nThere are some cases, recorded on undoubted authority, in which the\r\nchild has been heard to cry while in the womb. These are very\r\nexceptional. Under ordinary circumstances, it is impossible for the\r\nchild either to breathe or cry, because of the absence of air. It is\r\nonly when the bag of membranes has been torn, and the mouth of the child\r\nis applied at or near the neck of the uterus, that this can take place.\r\nThe infant is not unfrequently heard to cry just before birth, after\r\nlabor has commenced, but before the extrusion of the head from the womb,\r\nin consequence of the penetration of air into the uterine cavity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS IT A SON OR DAUGHTER?\r\n\r\nIt is a common saying among nurses, that there is a difference in the\r\nsize and form of the pregnant woman, according to the sex she carries.\r\nThis may well be doubted. Neither is it true that one sex is more\r\nactive in its 'movements' than the other. It is quite possible, however,\r\nfor a wife to know the sex of the foetus, if she can tell about what time\r\nin her month conception took place. If it occurred directly after a\r\nmonthly sickness, the child is a girl; if directly before, it is a boy.\r\nWhen a woman is 'out' in her reckoning, and goes beyond the period of\r\nher expected confinement, it will ordinarily turn out to be a boy. The\r\nskilful doctor can, in the later months of pregnancy, settle the\r\nquestion of sex in some cases. The beats of the foetal heart are more\r\nfrequent in females than in males. The average frequency of pulsations\r\nof twenty-eight female foetuses has been found to be one hundred and\r\nforty-four in the minute, the lowest figure being one hundred and\r\nthirty-eight; of twenty-two male foetuses, one hundred and twenty, the\r\nlowest figure being one hundred and twelve. Therefore, when the\r\npulsations of the heart of the child in the womb are counted,--as can\r\neasily be done by a practised medical ear during the last months of\r\npregnancy,--and are found to be over one hundred and thirty in a minute,\r\nit is a daughter; if under one hundred and thirty, a son. In this\r\nmanner, the sex of an unborn child can be predicted with tolerable\r\naccuracy, excepting only when illness of the foetus has deranged the\r\naction of its heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nARE THERE TWINS PRESENT?\r\n\r\nCertain signs lead to the suspicion of twins, such as being unusually\r\nlarge, and the fact that the increase in size has been more than\r\nordinarily rapid. Sometimes also the abdomen is divided into two\r\ndistinct portions by a perpendicular fissure. In other cases the\r\nmovements of a child can be felt on each side at the same time. And in\r\ntwin pregnancies the morning sickness is apt to be more distressing, and\r\nall the other discomforts incident to this condition increased. But\r\nthese signs and symptoms, when present in any given case, are not\r\nconclusive, for they may be noticed when there is only one child. The\r\ndoctor has one characteristic and infallible sign by which he can\r\nascertain whether the woman be pregnant with twins. It is furnished to\r\nhim again by the art of listening,--or auscultation, as it is\r\ntechnically called,--the same that, as we have already seen, may enable\r\nhim to determine the sex of the child. When the beatings of two foetal\r\nhearts are heard on opposite portions of the abdomen, the nature of the\r\npregnancy is apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENGTH OF PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\nWhat is the ordinary duration of pregnancy? Almost every woman considers\r\nherself competent to make the answer--nine months. She may be surprised\r\nto learn, however, that such an answer is wanting in scientific\r\nprecision. It is too indefinite, and is erroneous. There is a great\r\ndifference between the calendar and the lunar month. Each lunar month\r\nhaving twenty-eight days, the period of nine lunar months is two hundred\r\nand fifty-two days. Nine calendar months, including February, represent,\r\non the contrary, two hundred and seventy-three days. Now the average\r\nduration of pregnancy is two hundred and eighty days, that is forty\r\nweeks, or ten lunar months.\r\n\r\nWhile most extended observations have shown that as a general rule,\r\nforty weeks, or two hundred and eighty days, is the true period of\r\npregnancy, are we justified in the conclusion that this is its\r\ninvariable duration? This important question, upon the answer to which\r\nso often depend the honor of families, the rights of individuals, and\r\nsometimes the interests of nationalities, has been in all times the\r\nsubject of careful research by physicians, philosophers, and\r\nlegislators. On the one side, have been those who contend that the laws\r\nof nature are invariable, and that the term of pregnancy is fixed and\r\nimmutable. On the other side, have been those who assert that the epoch\r\nof accouchement can be greatly advanced or retarded by various causes,\r\nsome of which are known, and others not yet appreciated. Abundant and\r\nsatisfactory testimony has proved that the prolongation of pregnancy\r\nbeyond the ordinary period of two hundred and eighty days, or forty\r\nweeks, is possible. Nor is this contrary to what is observed in regard\r\nto other functions of the human body. There is no process depending upon\r\nthe laws of life which is absolutely invariable either as to the period\r\nof its appearance or duration. It is known, as we have already pointed\r\nout, that puberty may be advanced or retarded; the time at which the\r\nchange of life occurs in women, as we shall have occasion hereafter to\r\nshow, is also subject to variation; and it is a matter of common\r\nobservation with mothers, that the period of teething is sometimes\r\nstrangely hurried or delayed. A certain degree of variability,\r\ntherefore, being frequently observed, and entirely compatible with\r\nhealth, in the various other natural processes, why should that of\r\npregnancy form an exception, and be invariably fixed in its duration?\r\nAnd observation upon the lower animals affords most convincing evidence\r\nthat nature is not controlled by any uniform law in reference to the\r\nlength of pregnancy. In the cow, the usual period of whose pregnancy is\r\nthe same as in the human female, instances of calving six weeks beyond\r\nthe ordinary term are not at all uncommon.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the great interest sometimes attaching to the\r\ninquiry under discussion, we may cite the celebrated Gardner Peerage\r\nCase, tried by the House of Lords in 1825. Allen Legge Gardner\r\npetitioned to have his name inscribed as a peer on the Parliament Roll.\r\nHe was the son of Lord Gardner by his second wife. There was another\r\nclaimant for the peerage, however,--Henry Fenton Iadis,--on the ground,\r\nas alleged, that he was the son of Lord Gardner by his first and\r\nsubsequently divorced wife. Medical and moral evidence was adduced to\r\nestablish that the latter was illegitimate. Lady Gardner, the mother of\r\nthe alleged illegitimate child, parted from her husband on the 30th of\r\nJanuary, 1802, he going to the West Indies, and not again seeing his\r\nwife until the 11th of July following. The child whose legitimacy was\r\ncalled in question was born on the 8th of December of that year. The\r\nplain medical query therefore arose, Whether this child born either\r\nthree hundred and eleven days after intercourse (from January 30th to\r\nDecember 8th), or one hundred and fifty days (from July 11th to December\r\n8th), could be the son of Lord Gardner. As there was no pretence that\r\nthere was a premature birth, the child having been well developed when\r\nborn, the conception must have dated from January 30th. The medical\r\nquestion was therefore narrowed down to this: Was the alleged protracted\r\npregnancy (three hundred and eleven days) consistent with experience?\r\nSixteen of the principal obstetric practitioners of Great Britain were\r\nexamined on this point. Eleven concurred in the opinion that natural\r\npregnancy might be protracted to a period which would cover the birth of\r\nthe alleged illegitimate child. Because, however, of the moral evidence\r\nalone, which proved the adulterous intercourse of Lady Gardner with a\r\nMr. Iadis, the House decided that the title should descend to the son of\r\nthe second Lady Gardner.\r\n\r\nThere is on record one fact, well observed, which establishes beyond\r\ncavil the possibility of the protraction of pregnancy beyond two hundred\r\nand eighty days, or forty weeks. The case is reported by the learned Dr.\r\nDesormeaux of Paris, and occurred under his own notice in the Hôpital de\r\nMaternité of that city. A woman, the mother of three children, became\r\ninsane. Her physician thought that a new pregnancy might re-establish\r\nher intellectual faculties. Her husband consented to enter on the\r\nregister of the hospital each visit he was allowed to make her, which\r\ntook place only every three months. So soon as evidence of pregnancy\r\nshowed itself, the visits were discontinued. The woman was confined two\r\nhundred and ninety days after conception.\r\n\r\nThe late distinguished Professor Charles D. Meigs of Philadelphia\r\npublished a case, which he deems entirely trustworthy, of the\r\nprolongation of pregnancy to four hundred and twenty days, or sixty\r\nweeks. Dr. Atlee reports two cases, which nearly equaled three hundred\r\nand fifty-six days each. Professor Simpson of Edinburgh records, as\r\nhaving occurred in his own practice, cases in which the period reached\r\nthree hundred and thirty-six, three hundred and thirty-two, three\r\nhundred and twenty-four, and three hundred and nineteen days. In the\r\nDublin _Quarterly Journal of Medical Science_ a case of protracted\r\npregnancy is related by Dr. Joynt. The evidence is positive that the\r\nminimum duration must have been three hundred and seventeen days, or\r\nabout six weeks more than the average. Dr. Elsässer found, in one\r\nhundred and sixty cases of pregnancy, eleven protracted to periods\r\nvarying from three hundred to three hundred and eighteen days.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the subject of miscarriage, we mentioned instances,\r\nrecorded by physicians of skill and probity, proving beyond a shade of\r\ndoubt that a woman may give birth to a living child long before the\r\nexpiration of the forty weeks. The Presbytery of Edinburgh, Scotland,\r\nsome time since decided in favor of the legitimacy of an infant born\r\nalive, within twenty-five weeks after marriage, to the Rev. Fergus\r\nJardine.\r\n\r\nOne of the most enlightened countries in Europe has, in view of the\r\nfacts in reference to the extreme limits of pregnancy, enacted, in the\r\nCode Napoléon, that a child born within three hundred days after the\r\ndeparture or death of the husband, or one hundred and eighty days after\r\nmarriage, shall be considered legitimate. The law further states that a\r\nchild born after more than three hundred days shall not be necessarily\r\ndeclared a bastard, but its legitimacy may be contested. The Scotch\r\nlegislation on this subject is very similar to the French.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF PROTRACTED PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted by some that an infant is born at ten or eleven\r\nmonths because at nine months it has not acquired the growth which\r\nis necessary in order to induce the womb to dislodge it. The popular\r\nnotion is, that a child carried beyond the usual term must necessarily\r\nbe a large one. Rabelais has reflected this common opinion in his\r\ncelebrated romance entitled 'Gargantua,' in which he represents the\r\nroyal giant of that name as having been carried by his mother,\r\nGargamelle, eleven months. When born, the child was so vigorous that he\r\nsucked the milk from ten nurses. He lived for several centuries, and at\r\nlast begot a son, Pantagruel, as wonderful as himself. Such reasoning\r\ncannot, however, be seriously maintained, as many children carried\r\nlonger than nine months have not been more fully developed than some\r\nborn a few weeks prematurely; and the size of the child has nothing to\r\ndo with the bringing on of labor, as we shall show hereafter. Protracted\r\npregnancies are caused by a defect in the energy of the womb, induced\r\nby moral as well as physical influences. As a rule, a woman who leads a\r\nregular life, and observes the physiological laws of her being, which\r\nlaws it has been our aim to point out, will be confined at the term that\r\nnature usually marks out, that is, at the expiration of two hundred and\r\neighty days, or forty weeks, from conception.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the consideration of the question,\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO CALCULATE THE TIME OF EXPECTED LABOR.\r\n\r\nMany rules for this purpose have been laid down. We shall merely give\r\none, the most satisfactory and the most easily applied. It was suggested\r\nby the celebrated Professor Naëgelè of Heidelberg, and is now generally\r\nrecommended and employed by physicians. The point of departure in making\r\nthe calculation is _the day of the disappearance of the last monthly\r\nsickness_; three months are subtracted, and seven days added. The result\r\ncorresponds to the day on which labor will commence, and will be found\r\nto be two hundred and eighty days from the time of conception, if that\r\nevent has occurred, as ordinarily, immediately after the last menstrual\r\nperiod. Suppose, for instance, the cessation of the last monthly\r\nsickness happened on the 14th day of January; subtract three months, and\r\nwe have October 14; then add seven days, and we obtain the 21st day of\r\nthe ensuing October (two hundred and eighty days from January 14) as the\r\ntime of the expected confinement. This method of making the 'count' may\r\nbe relied upon with confidence, and only fails, by a few days, in those\r\nexceptional cases in which conception takes place just before the\r\nmonthly period, or during the menstrual flow.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF HEALTH DURING PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\nThis subject, the proper management of the health from conception to\r\nchildbirth, is worthy of careful consideration. The condition of\r\npregnancy, though not one of disease, calls for peculiar solicitude,\r\nlest it should lead to some affection in the mother or in the child. For\r\nit ought to be remembered that the welfare of a new being is now in the\r\nbalance. The woman has no longer an independent existence. She has\r\nentered upon the circle of her maternal duties. She became a mother when\r\nshe conceived. The child, though unborn, lives within her; its life is a\r\npart of her own, and so frail, that any indiscretion on her part may\r\ndestroy it. The danger to the child is not imaginary, as the large\r\nnumber of miscarriages and still-births proves.\r\n\r\nAll mothers desire to have healthy, well-formed, intelligent children.\r\nHow few conduct themselves in such a manner as to secure a happy\r\ndevelopment of their offspring! Puny, deformed, and feeble-minded\r\ninfants are daily ushered into the world because of a want of knowledge,\r\nor a sinful neglect of those special measures imperatively demanded in\r\nthe ordering of the daily life, by the changed state of the system\r\nconsequent upon pregnancy. We shall therefore point out those laws which\r\ncannot be infringed with impunity, and indicate the diet, exercise,\r\ndress, and, in general, the conduct most favorable to the mother and\r\nchild during this critical period, in which the wife occupies, as it\r\nwere, an intermediate state between health and sickness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD.\r\n\r\nThe nourishment taken during pregnancy should be abundant, but not, in\r\nthe early months, larger in quantity than usual. Excess in eating or\r\ndrinking ought to be most carefully avoided. The food is to be taken at\r\nshorter intervals than is common, and it should be plain, simple, and\r\nnutritious. Fatty articles, the coarser vegetables, highly salted and\r\nsweet food, if found to disagree, as is often the case, should be\r\nabstained from. The flesh of young animals--as lamb, veal, chicken, and\r\nfresh fish--is wholesome, and generally agrees with the stomach. Ripe\r\nfruits are beneficial. The diet should be varied as much as possible\r\nfrom day to day. The craving which some women have in the night or early\r\nmorning may be relieved by a biscuit, a little milk, or a cup of coffee.\r\nWhen taken a few hours before rising, this will generally be retained,\r\nand prove very grateful, even though the morning sickness be\r\ntroublesome. Any food or medicine that will confine or derange the\r\nbowels is to be forbidden. The taste is, as a rule, a safe guide, and it\r\nmay be reasonably indulged. But inordinate, capricious desires for\r\nimproper, noxious articles, should of course, be opposed. Such longings,\r\nhowever, are not often experienced by those properly brought up. It is a\r\ncurious fact, that the modification in the digestive system during\r\npregnancy is sometimes so great that substances ordinarily the most\r\nindigestible are eaten, without any inconvenience, and even with\r\nbenefit, while the most healthful articles become hurtful, and act like\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nAs pregnancy advances, particularly after the sixth month, a larger\r\namount of food, and that of a more substantial character, will be\r\nrequired. The number of meals in the day should then be increased,\r\nrather than the quantity taken at each meal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOTHING.\r\n\r\nThe dress during pregnancy should be loose and comfortable, nowhere\r\npressing tightly or unequally. The word _enceinte_, by which a pregnant\r\nwoman is designated, meant, originally, without a cincture,--that is,\r\nunbound. The Roman matrons, so soon as they conceived, were obliged to\r\nremove their girdles. Lycurgus caused the enactment of the Spartan law,\r\nthat pregnant women should wear large dresses, so as not to prejudice\r\nthe free development of the precious charges of which nature had\r\nrendered them the momentary depositaries. Stays or corsets may be used,\r\nin a proper manner, during the first five or six months of pregnancy,\r\nbut after that they should either be laid aside, or worn very loosely.\r\nAny attempt at concealing pregnancy, by tight lacing and the application\r\nof a stronger busk, cannot be too severely condemned. By this false\r\ndelicacy the mother is subjected to great suffering, and the child\r\nplaced in jeopardy. The shape of the stays should be moulded to that of\r\nthe changing figure, and great care should be taken that they do not\r\ndepress the nipple or irritate the enlarging breasts.\r\n\r\nThe amount of clothing should be suited to the season, but rather\r\nincreased than diminished, owing to the great susceptibility of the\r\nsystem to the vicissitudes of the weather. It is especially important\r\nthat flannel drawers should be worn during advanced pregnancy, as the\r\nloose dress favors the admission of cold air to the unprotected parts of\r\nthe body. A neglect of this precaution sometimes leads to the\r\nestablishment of the painful disease known as rheumatism of the womb.\r\n\r\nPressure upon the lower limbs, in the neighborhood of the knee or the\r\nankle joint, should be avoided, more particularly towards the last\r\nmonths. It is apt to produce enlargement and knotting of the vein,\r\nswelling and ulcers of the legs, by which many women are crippled during\r\ntheir pregnancies, and sometimes through life. Therefore the garters\r\nshould not be tightly drawn, and gaiters should not be too closely\r\nfitted, while yet they should firmly support the ankle.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISE.\r\n\r\nModerate exercise in the open air is proper and conducive to health\r\nduring the whole period of pregnancy. It should never be so active nor\r\nso prolonged as to induce fatigue. Walking is the best form of exercise.\r\nRiding in a badly-constructed carriage, or over a rough road, or upon\r\nhorseback, as well as running, dancing, and the lifting or carrying of\r\nheavy weights, should be scrupulously avoided, as liable to cause\r\nrupture, severe flooding, and miscarriage. During the early months, in\r\nparticular, extraordinarily long walks and dancing ought not to be\r\nindulged in. Journeys are not to be taken while in the pregnant state.\r\nRailway travelling is decidedly objectionable. The vibratory motion of\r\nthe cars is apt to produce headache, sickness at the stomach, faintness,\r\nand premature labor. All these precautions are especially to be observed\r\nin the first pregnancy.\r\n\r\nWe must not be understood as condemning exercise and fresh air. They are\r\nof the greatest importance to mother and child. But the amount of\r\nexercise should be regulated by the dictates of common sense and the\r\nwoman's own sensations. If she can only walk a short distance each day\r\nwith comfort, let that suffice. She should not force herself to go to a\r\ncertain place nor to promenade during a certain time in the twenty-four\r\nhours. So soon as fatigue is felt, the walk should cease. Let the walks\r\nbe frequent and short, rather than few and long. They should also be\r\nmade as pleasant as possible, by companionship and surroundings that\r\nwill occupy the feelings and imagination in an agreeable manner with new\r\nand cheerful impressions. A tendency to indolence is to be combated. A\r\ngently active life is best calculated to preserve the health of the\r\nmother and her unborn child. But with even the most robust a moderation\r\nof the ordinary pursuits and avocations is called for. The nervous and\r\ndelicate cannot make with safety their customary daily exertions in the\r\nperformance of their household or social duties and pleasures.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of pregnancy the wife should economize her forces. She\r\nshould not remain long standing or kneeling, nor sing in either of these\r\npostures.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATHING.\r\n\r\nThose who have not been accustomed to bathing should not begin the\r\npractice during pregnancy, and in any case great care should be\r\nexercised during the latter months. It is better to preserve cleanliness\r\nby sponging with tepid water than by entire baths. Foot-baths are always\r\ndangerous. Sea-bathing sometimes causes miscarriage, but sea air and the\r\nsponging of the body with salt water are beneficial. The shower-bath is\r\nof course too great a shock to the system, and a very warm bath is too\r\nrelaxing. In some women of a nervous temperament, a lukewarm bath taken\r\noccasionally at night during pregnancy has a calming influence. This is\r\nespecially the case in the first and last month. But women of a\r\nlymphatic temperament and of a relaxed habit of body are always injured\r\nby the bath.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENTILATION.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the benefits of outdoor air during pregnancy.\r\nAttention should also be directed to keeping the atmosphere in the\r\nsitting and sleeping rooms of the house fresh. This can only be\r\naccomplished by constantly changing it. The doors and windows of every\r\nroom, while unoccupied, should be kept thrown open in the summer-time,\r\nand opened sufficiently often in the winter to wash out the apartments\r\nseveral times a day with fresh air. The extremes of heat and cold are\r\nto be, with equal care, avoided. The house should be kept light. Young\r\nplants will not grow well in the dark. Neither will the young child nor\r\nits mother flourish without sunlight. The ancients were so well aware of\r\nthis, that they constructed on the top of each house a solarium, or\r\nsolar air-bath, where they basked daily, in thin attire, in the direct\r\nrays of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLEEP.\r\n\r\nDuring pregnancy a large amount of sleep is required. It has a sedative\r\ninfluence upon the disturbed nervous system of the mother. It favors, by\r\nthe calmness of all the functions which attends it, the growth of the\r\nfoetus. Neither the pursuit of pleasure in the evening, nor the\r\nobservance of any trite maxims in regard to early rising in the morning,\r\nshould be allowed to curtail the hours devoted to slumber. Pregnant\r\nwomen have an instinctive desire to lie abed late, which, like the other\r\npromptings of nature during this period, should not be disregarded. At\r\nleast eight hours out of the twenty-four can be profitably spent in bed.\r\nNo night-watching ought ever to be undertaken during pregnancy.\r\n\r\nFeather beds should be avoided. The heat which they maintain about the\r\nbody is inconvenient and dangerous, predisposing to flooding and\r\nexhausting perspirations. The hair or sponge mattress is to be\r\npreferred. The bed-clothing should not be too heavy. Blankets are to be\r\nemployed rather than coverlids, as they are lighter and more permeable\r\nto perspiration. The mattress and cover should be well aired during the\r\nday. The sleeping-room should be capacious and well ventilated, and no\r\ncurtains permitted about the bed.\r\n\r\nOccasional rest is also necessary in the daytime. A nap of an hour or\r\ntwo upon a sofa or lounge will then prove very refreshing. In the\r\nearlier months of pregnancy it will tend to prevent miscarriage, and in\r\nthe latter months to relieve the distress consequent upon the increased\r\nsize of the womb. It is not unusual, as the close of pregnancy\r\napproaches, for a feeling of suffocation to ensue when the woman\r\nattempts to lie down. This may be overcome by supporting the back and\r\nshoulders with cushions and pillows. Or a bed-chair may be employed.\r\nThis, if well constructed and covered, will often be found very grateful\r\nat night, in the last few weeks of pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIND.\r\n\r\nA tranquil mind is of the first importance to the pregnant woman. Gloomy\r\nforebodings should not be encouraged. Pregnancy and labor are not, we\r\nrepeat, diseased conditions. They are healthful processes, and should be\r\nlooked upon as such by every woman. Bad labors are very infrequent. It\r\nis as foolish to dread them, as it is for the railway traveller to give\r\nway to misgivings in regard to his safety. Instead of desponding,\r\nscience bids the woman to look forward with cheerfulness and hope to the\r\njoys of maternity.\r\n\r\nThe bad effects of fear upon the mother's mind are illustrated by\r\nPlutarch, who, in his Life of Publicola, mentions that, 'at a time when\r\na superstitious fear overran the city of Rome, all the women then\r\npregnant brought forth imperfect children, and were prematurely\r\ndelivered.' But we have already spoken, in treating of mothers' marks,\r\nof the influence of mental emotions over the unborn child, and the\r\nnecessity of avoiding their exciting causes.\r\n\r\nBecause of their deleterious tendency, severe study as well as arduous\r\nand protracted manual labor ought to be avoided. The nervous systems of\r\nmany women are also injuriously affected during pregnancy by perfumes,\r\nwhich at other times are agreeable and innocuous. It is therefore\r\nprudent not only to exclude all offensive scents, but also to abstain\r\nfrom the strong odors of various strong perfumes, eau-de-cologne, and of\r\nflowers. Large bouquets often cause feelings of faintness, and sometimes\r\ntemporary loss of consciousness. The extreme liability of the nervous\r\nsystem of the pregnant woman to be affected injuriously to herself and\r\nchild by scenes of suffering or distress, and by disgusting or frightful\r\nobjects, cannot be too strongly impressed upon every one. She should be\r\nprotected from all that will disturb her, and should be constantly\r\ntreated with soothing and encouraging kindness. Her manifestations of\r\nirritability, her caprices, her melancholy anticipations, are not to be\r\nscoffed at, but combated with a mixture of reasoning and patient\r\nforbearance. On her part, she should endeavour to co-operate with those\r\naround her, in sedulously shunning all injurious influences, and in\r\nbanishing as quickly as possible all improper longings. She should\r\nremember that, although she herself may escape mischief from them, her\r\nchild may suffer. She is the custodian of interests dearer to her than\r\nher own.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATION OF HUSBAND AND WIFE DURING PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\nDuring those days when the wife, if she were not pregnant, would have\r\nbeen 'unwell,' marital intercourse should be abstained from. It is then\r\ninjurious to the mother, and dangerous to the life of the child, as it\r\nis liable to excite miscarriage. But if this habitual epoch of the\r\nmonthly sickness be avoided, there is no reason why passion should not\r\nbe gratified in moderation and with caution during the whole period of\r\npregnancy. There is one exception to be made to this general course of\r\nconduct. In those cases in which a miscarriage has occurred in the first\r\npregnancy, every precaution should be employed--for reasons which have\r\nbeen dwelt upon in a previous article--to prevent its happening again\r\nafter the second conception. Under such exceptional circumstances,\r\ntherefore, the husband and wife should sleep apart during the first five\r\nmonths of pregnancy. After that period their ordinary relations may be\r\nresumed. When a miscarriage has taken place, intercourse should not be\r\npermitted within a month of the accident. The observance of this\r\ndirection is of the utmost importance. Its neglect is the frequent cause\r\nof severe and intractable diseases of the womb.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF PREGNANCY ON HEALTH.\r\n\r\nWe have had occasion to remark that pregnancy is not a condition of\r\ndisease. It is not only an evidence of health, but during its\r\ncontinuance it confers increased physical vigor. As a rule, a woman\r\nenjoys _better health_ during her pregnancy than at any other time; she\r\nis less liable to contagious and other maladies; she is less apt to die\r\nthan at any other period of her life; and her general constitution seems\r\nalso then to receive a favorable impress, for wives and mothers live\r\nlonger than celibates. It is wisely decreed that when woman is engaged\r\nin this, to her, anxious stage of reproduction, she shall not be exposed\r\nto the pains and dangers of disease, and that those great covenants of\r\nnature--marriage and child-bearing--shall be rewarded by added strength\r\nand length of days.\r\n\r\nThere are certain disorders incident, in exceptional cases, to\r\npregnancy, of which we shall shortly speak. In general, however, we\r\nrepeat that this condition is one of extraordinary health. More than\r\nthis, in numerous instances it exerts an ameliorating influence upon\r\npre-existing diseases, suspending their march, or bringing about a\r\ndecidedly curative effect. Thus, various obstinate chronic affections of\r\nthe skin, of the womb and ovaries, and of the brain and nervous system,\r\nfrequently get well during pregnancy; and it is well known to every\r\nphysician, that by the judicious management of this state, and of the\r\nlying-in period, troublesome displacements of the womb may be arrested.\r\n\r\nIt should nevertheless ever be recollected that the condition of\r\npregnancy is one of excitement and enhanced susceptibility to\r\nimpressions of all kinds. For this reason a change in the habits of\r\nlife is necessary; and the importance of the directions laid down for\r\nthe care of the health during this period, cannot be too strongly\r\ninsisted upon.\r\n\r\nThe diseases to which the wife is exposed during pregnancy will be\r\ntreated of in the chapter on 'Health in Marriage.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFINEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PREPARATIONS FOR CHILDBIRTH._\r\n\r\nCertain foolish preparations are sometimes made by wives, with the best\r\nintentions. Perhaps one of the most common and absurd of these is the\r\nlocal use of sweet oil, in order to facilitate the dilatation of the\r\nparts, for which purpose it is perfectly inert. There are, however, some\r\nwise and even necessary precautions which every wife should know and\r\nemploy, to guard against unpleasant and dangerous complications in\r\nchildbirth.\r\n\r\nIn particular, _the condition of the breasts_ towards the close of\r\npregnancy demands attention. Scarcely any pain in the lying-in chamber\r\nis greater or more difficult to bear than that which the young mother\r\nsuffers from excoriated nipples. This troublesome and often very\r\nintractable affection is nearly always the consequence of the want of\r\ncare previous to confinement. During the latter part of pregnancy the\r\nnipples sometimes become sunken or flat, being retracted as the breasts\r\nincrease in size, because of the want of elasticity on the part of the\r\nmilk tubes. In order to remedy this fault, we have known a breast-pump\r\nor puppy to be applied. Such treatment is dangerous, as it may excite\r\npremature contraction of the womb, and miscarriage. Nipple-shields,\r\nwith broad bases and openings, should always be obtained. They are safe,\r\nand effectually secure the prominence of the nipples, when worn\r\nconstantly, day and night, during the last month or so of pregnancy.\r\nWives who have never had children ought to take special care to\r\nascertain before labor whether this depressed condition of the nipples\r\nexists, and to correct it in the manner indicated.\r\n\r\nIn the first pregnancy it is also important to _harden the nipples_.\r\nThis may be done by occasionally gently rubbing them between the thumb\r\nand finger, and by bathing them twice a day during the last six weeks\r\nwith tincture of myrrh, or with a mixture of equal parts of brandy and\r\nwater, to which a little alum has been added. This procedure will render\r\nthe surfaces less sensitive to the friction of the child's mouth, and\r\nthus avert the distress so often occasioned in the first confinement by\r\ntenderness of the nipples.\r\n\r\nIf the nipples be rough or nodulated in appearance, like a strawberry or\r\na raspberry, they are more apt to become excoriated or fissured than if\r\nthey present a smooth surface. Under such circumstances, make a solution\r\nof the sulphate of zinc, of the strength of one grain to the ounce of\r\nrose water, in a wide-mouthed bottle, then tilt the bottle upon the\r\nnipple, and allow it to remain there for a few minutes several times a\r\nday. Simple tenderness of the nipples and slight fissures may be averted\r\nby the application either of a lotion of borax (two scruples of borax in\r\nthree ounces of water, and an ounce of glycerine), of the honey of\r\nborax, or of the tincture of catechu, and by protecting the parts from\r\nthe pressure of the stays and the friction of the flannel vest.\r\n\r\nIt is of the greatest moment to the comfort of the mother, that all\r\naffections of the nipples should be prevented or remedied before labor;\r\nfor the treatment of sore nipples when the child is at the breast is\r\noften unsatisfactory, while the suffering they occasion is very great,\r\neven sometimes giving rise to mammary abscess.\r\n\r\nThere are certain _articles of clothing_ and _dressings for the bed_\r\nwhich should be cared for in advance, in order that they may be ready\r\nwhen required.\r\n\r\nThe mother should be provided with short-gowns, to be worn over the\r\nchemise instead of the ordinary night-gowns. It is of consequence to\r\nprocure a proper _bandage_. It should be made of heavy muslin, neither\r\ntoo coarse nor too fine; an ordinarily good quality of unbleached muslin\r\nis the best. The material is to be cut bias, about one and a quarter\r\nyard in length, and from twelve to eighteen inches in breadth, varying,\r\nof course, with the size of the person. It should be just large enough\r\nto encircle the body after confinement, with a margin of a couple of\r\ninches, and to extend down below the fulness of the hips. The\r\nmeasurement should be taken, and the bandage made to fit, when four and\r\na half months advanced. It should be narrow above, wider below, and\r\ngored in such a manner that it will be a little narrower at the lower\r\nextremity than a few inches above, so as to prevent it, when adjusted,\r\nfrom sliding upwards. A bandage constructed in this manner will be very\r\ncomfortable; and is not apt to become displaced, after application, as\r\nis invariably the case when a towel or a straight piece of muslin is\r\nused. The way in which it is to be applied will be detailed hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe _child's clothing_ should consist first of a piece of flannel or\r\nsome woollen material for a binder. This should be from four to six\r\ninches in width, and from twelve to sixteen inches in length; that is to\r\nsay, wide enough to extend from the armpits to the lower part of the\r\nabdomen, and long enough to go once and a half times around the child,\r\nhaving the double fold to come over the abdomen. There should be no\r\nembroidery about this. A shirt, which it is desirable should be woollen,\r\nis to be provided to place over the binder. It should be made to come up\r\ntolerably high in the neck, and to extend down the arm. Neither it nor\r\nany other portion of the child's clothing should be starched. The\r\npetticoat, which may be open its whole length behind, is to be put over\r\nthe shirt; two may be used--a short and a long one. Next comes the\r\nchild's ordinary frock or slip, and above this an apron to protect the\r\ndress from the frequent discharges from the stomach. Then a shawl, of\r\nflannel or any other warm material, is to be provided, to throw over the\r\nshoulders if the weather be cold. Socks, and pieces of old soft linen,\r\nfree from stiffening, for napkins or diapers, complete the child's\r\noutfit.\r\n\r\nFor the _permanent and temporary dressing of the bed_ there should be\r\nprovided a piece of impervious cloth (oiled silk is the neatest) about a\r\nyard square; a piece of ordinary table oil-cloth or rubber-cloth; a\r\nnumber of old sheets and comfortables, and a piece of thick carpet. The\r\nmanner in which these are to be used will be explained shortly.\r\n\r\nA pair of small rounded scissors; a package of large pins, one and a\r\nhalf inches in length, for the bandage of the mother, and smaller ones\r\nfor that of the child; some good linen bobbin for the doctor to tie the\r\nnavel-string; good toilet soap and fine surgical sponge for washing the\r\nchild; a piece of soft linen or muslin for dressing the navel; a box of\r\nunirritating powder; and a pile of towels,--should all be had and laid\r\naside many weeks before they are wanted. These, together with the\r\nmaterial for dressing the bed, the child's clothing, and the mother's\r\nbandage, ought to be placed together in a basket got for the purpose, in\r\norder that they may all be easily and certainly found at a time when\r\nperhaps the hurry and excitement of the moment would render it difficult\r\notherwise to collect them all immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF APPROACHING LABOR.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest of the preliminary signs of the coming on of\r\nconfinement occurs about two weeks before that event. It is a dropping\r\nor subsidence of the womb. The summit of that organ then descends, in\r\nmost cases, from above to below the umbilicus, and the abdomen becomes\r\nsmaller. The stomach and lungs are relieved from pressure, the woman\r\nbreathes more freely, the sense of oppression which troubled her\r\npreviously is lost, and she says she feels 'very comfortable.' This\r\nsensation of lightness and buoyancy increases, and a few days before the\r\nsetting in of labor she feels so much better that she thinks she will\r\ntake an extra amount of exercise. The mother of a number of children is\r\nacquainted with this sign, but the wife with her first child may exert\r\nherself unduly in the house or outdoors, and induce labor when in the\r\nstreet or away from home. Hence the importance of a knowledge of this\r\npremonitory symptom.\r\n\r\nA second precursory sign of labor is found in the increased fulness of\r\nthe external parts, and an augmented mucous secretion, which may amount\r\neven to a discharge resembling whites, and requiring the wearing of a\r\nnapkin. This symptom is a good one, indicating a disposition to\r\nrelaxation, and promising an easy time.\r\n\r\nThe third preliminary sign which we shall mention, is the change in the\r\nmental state of the pregnant woman. She has a feeling of anxiety and of\r\nfidgetiness, sometimes accompanied with depression of spirits. This\r\ncondition of emotional distress, modified in particular cases by reason,\r\nself-control, and religion, may continue for several days, perhaps, when\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPTOMS OF ACTUAL LABOR\r\n\r\nmake their appearance. The first of these is generally the 'show.' It is\r\nthe discharge of the plug of mucus which has occupied the neck of the\r\nwomb up to this time, and is ordinarily accompanied by a little blood.\r\nPerhaps before this, or perhaps not for some hours after, the 'pains'\r\nwill develope themselves. These recur periodically, at intervals of an\r\nhour or half an hour at the outset, and are 'grinding' in character.\r\n_True_ labor pains are distinguished from _false_ by the fact that they\r\nare felt in the back, passing on to the thighs, while false pains are\r\nreferred to the abdomen; by their intermittent character, the spurious\r\npains being more or less continuous; and by the steady increase in their\r\nfrequency and severity. In case of doubt as to their exact nature, the\r\ndoctor should be summoned, who will be able to determine positively\r\nwhether labor has begun.\r\n\r\nThe other symptoms which point to the actual commencement of labor are a\r\nfrequent desire to empty the bowels and bladder, nausea and vomiting,\r\nwhich, in the early part of confinement, is a good sign; shiverings,\r\nunattended with any sensation of cold; and, finally, the rupture and\r\ndischarge of the contents of the 'bag of waters.'\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to the consideration of the management of the\r\nconfinement into which the wife has now entered, a few words may be\r\nappropriately said upon the\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF LABOR.\r\n\r\nNeither the size nor the vigor of the child has any influence in\r\nbringing about delivery at full term. The ancient theory--which received\r\nthe support of the distinguished naturalist Buffon--that the infant was\r\nthe active agent in causing its own expulsion, is an exploded one. It\r\nwas asserted by some that hunger excited the foetus to struggle to free\r\nitself from the womb; others were disposed to attribute its efforts to\r\naccomplish its entrance into the world, to the need of respiration which\r\nit experienced. But all these ingenious theories, which presupposed the\r\nembryo to be actuated by the same feelings which would influence a grown\r\nperson if shut up in such a confined abode, are unsatisfactory, and not\r\ntenable. It is well known that the child may die in the womb, without\r\nretarding or interfering in any way with the coming on of the process of\r\nlabor. This fact alone shows that the foetus is, or at any rate may be,\r\nabsolutely passive either in regard to the induction or advancement of\r\ndelivery. The determining cause of labor is seated in the womb itself.\r\nThe contractions of this organ occasion the 'pains' and expel the child,\r\nassisted by the muscles of the abdomen and the diaphragm. That the\r\nassistance of the latter forces is not necessary, is conclusively proved\r\nby the occurrence of childbirth after the decease of the mother. For\r\ninstance, a case is on record in which labor commenced and twins were\r\nborn after the mother had been dead for three days.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE DURING LABOR.\r\n\r\nWe will suppose labor to have commenced. The _preparation of the bed_\r\nfor the occupancy of the mother is now to be attended to. As she is to\r\nlie on the _left side_ of the bed, this is the side, and the only one,\r\nwhich is to be dressed for the occasion. In order to do so, remove the\r\nouter bed-clothes one at a time, folding them neatly on the right side\r\nof the bed so that they can easily be drawn over when desired. The\r\n_permanent dressing_ is to be placed beneath the lower sheet and upon\r\nthe mattress. A soft impervious cloth--which, in speaking of the\r\npreparation for confinement, we directed to be procured--is placed next\r\nto the surface of the bed. The upper edge should be nearly as high as\r\nthe margin of the bolster, and it should extend down to a distance at\r\nleast a foot below the level of the hips, so as to certainly protect the\r\nbed from the discharges. Upon the top of this a blanket or sheet is\r\nlaid, and the whole fastened by pins. The lower sheet of the bed, which\r\nhad been turned over to the right side, to permit the application of the\r\ndressing, is now to be replaced. Over the position of this permanent\r\ndressing, on the top of the bed-sheet, a neatly-folded sheet, with the\r\nfolded edge down, is adjusted and pinned in its place. It is upon this\r\nsheet that the patient is to be drawn up after her confinement, which\r\nwill take place upon the _temporary dressing_ of the bed now to be\r\narranged. It consists of an oil-cloth, which should extend up beyond the\r\nlower edge of the permanent dressing, overlapping the folded sheet which\r\nhas been placed above it, and should fall over the side and bottom of\r\nthe bed. A comfortable or any soft absorbent material is placed over\r\nthis impervious cloth and covered with a folded sheet, completing the\r\ntemporary dressing. The bed-clothes may now be adjusted, concealing the\r\ndressings from view until they are wanted. The valances at the foot of\r\nthe bed should be raised, and a piece of carpet placed on the floor. The\r\nbed should have no foot-board, or a very low one.\r\n\r\n_The dress of the mother._--Either a folded sheet should be adjusted\r\naround the waist as the only skirt, so as not to interfere with the\r\nwalking, or a second chemise should be put on, with the arms outside the\r\nsleeves, to extend from the waist to the feet. Then the chemise next the\r\nbody should be drawn up and folded high up around the breast. It should\r\nbe plaited neatly along the back, and brought forward and fastened by\r\npins. This should be thoroughly done, so that the linen may not be found\r\nwet nor soiled when it is drawn down after confinement. A wrapper or\r\ndressing-gown may be worn during the first stage of labor, before it is\r\nnecessary to go to bed. When, however, that time comes, the wife will\r\ntake her place on her left side on the temporary dressing, with a sheet\r\nthrown over her, her head on a pillow so situated that her body will be\r\nbent well forward, and her feet against the bed-post. A sheet should be\r\ntwisted into a cord and fastened to the foot of the bed, for her to\r\nseize with her hands during the accession of the 'bearing-down pains.'\r\nCare should be taken to have a number of napkins, a pot of fresh lard,\r\nand the basket containing the scissors, ligature, bandage, etc.--which\r\nhave been previously enumerated in the remarks on preparations for\r\nchildbirth--at hand, for the use of the doctor.\r\n\r\nWe have now noted all that it is useful for the wife to know in regard\r\nto the preparation for and management of confinement, when a physician\r\nis in attendance, as, for obvious reasons, he should always be. In some\r\ninstances, however, the absence of the doctor is unavoidable, or the\r\nlabor is completed before his arrival. As a guide to the performance of\r\nthe necessary duties of the lying-in room under such circumstances, we\r\ngive some\r\n\r\n\r\nHINTS TO ATTENDANTS.\r\n\r\nThe room during confinement should be kept quiet. Too many persons must\r\nnot be allowed in it, as they contaminate the air, and are apt by their\r\nconversation to disturb the patient, either exciting or depressing her.\r\nSo soon as the head is born, it should be immediately ascertained\r\nwhether the neck is encircled by the cord; if so, it should be removed\r\nor loosened. The neglect of this precaution may result fatally to the\r\ninfant, as happened a short time since in our own practice; the infant,\r\nborn a few minutes before our arrival, being found strangled with the\r\ncord about its neck. It is also of importance at once to allow of the\r\nentrance of air to the face, to put the finger in the mouth to remove\r\nany obstruction which may interfere with respiration, and to lay the\r\nbabe on its right side, with the head removed from the discharges. The\r\ncord should not be tied until the infant is heard to cry. The ligature\r\nis to be applied in the following manner:--A piece of bobbin is thrown\r\naround the navel-string, and tied with a double knot at the distance of\r\nthree fingers' breadth from the umbilicus; a second piece is tied an\r\ninch beyond the first, and the cord divided with the scissors between\r\nthe two, care being taken not to clip off a finger or otherwise injure\r\nthe unsuspecting little infant, as has occurred in careless hands more\r\nthan once. When the child is separated from the mother, a warm blanket\r\nor a piece of flannel should be ready to receive it. In taking hold of\r\nthe little stranger, it may slip out of the hands and be injured. To\r\nguard against this accident, which is very apt to occur with awkward or\r\ninexperienced persons, always seize the back portion of the neck in the\r\nspace bounded by the thumb and first finger of one hand, and grasp the\r\nthighs with the other. In this way it may be safely carried. It should\r\nbe transferred, wrapped up in its blanket, to some _secure_ place, and\r\nnever put in an arm-chair, where it may be crushed by some one who does\r\nnot observe that the chair is already occupied. The head of the child\r\nshould not be so covered as to incur any danger of suffocation.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTENTION TO THE MOTHER.\r\n\r\nWhen the after-birth has come away, the mother should be drawn up a\r\nshort distance--six or eight inches--in bed, and the sheet which has\r\nbeen pinned around her, together with the temporary dressing of the bed\r\nremoved, a clean folded sheet being introduced under the hips. The parts\r\nshould be gently washed with warm water and a soft sponge or a cloth,\r\nafter which an application of equal parts of claret wine and water will\r\nprove pleasant and beneficial. We have also found the anointing of the\r\nexternal and internal parts with goose grease, which has been thoroughly\r\nwashed in several hot waters, to be very soothing and efficient in\r\nspeedily allaying all irritation. This ought all to be done under cover,\r\nto guard against the taking of cold. The chemise pinned up around the\r\nbreast should now be loosened, and the woman is ready for the\r\napplication of the bandage, which is to be put on next the skin. If\r\nproperly and nicely adjusted, it will prove very grateful. The\r\ndirections for making it have already been given. In order to apply it,\r\none half of its length should be folded up into plaits, and the mother\r\nshould lie on her left side; lay the plaited end of the bandage\r\nunderneath the left side of the patient, carrying it as far under as\r\npossible, and draw the loose end over the abdomen; then let the mother\r\nroll over on her back upon the bandage, and draw out the plaited end. If\r\nthe abdominal muscles are much relaxed and the hip-bones prominent, a\r\ncompress of two or three towels will be wanted. The bandage should be\r\nfirst tightened in the middle by a pin applied laterally, for strings\r\nshould never be employed. The pins should be placed at intervals of\r\nabout an inch. The lower portion of the bandage should be made quite\r\ntight, to prevent it slipping up. The mother is now ready to be drawn up\r\nin bed upon the permanent dressing: this should be done without any\r\nexertion on her part. A napkin should be laid smoothly _under_ the hips\r\n(never folded up), to receive the discharges. If she prefer to lie on\r\nher left side, place a pillow behind her back.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTENTION TO THE CHILD.\r\n\r\nThe baby may now be washed and dressed. Before beginning, everything\r\nthat is wanted should be close at hand, namely a basin of warm water, a\r\nlarge quantity of lard or some other unctuous material, soap, fine\r\nsponge, and a basket containing the binder, shirt, and other articles of\r\nclothing. First rub the child's body thoroughly with lard. The covering\r\ncan only be removed in this way; the use of soap alone will have no\r\neffect unless the friction be so great as to take off also the skin. The\r\nnurse should take a handful of lard and rub it in with the palm of the\r\nhand, particularly in the flexures of the joints. In anointing one part,\r\nthe others should be covered, to prevent the child from taking cold. If\r\nthe child is thus made perfectly clean, do not use any soap and water,\r\nbecause the skin is left in a more healthful condition by the lard, and\r\nthere is risk of the child's taking cold from the evaporation of the\r\nwater. But the face may be washed with soap and water, great care being\r\ntaken not to let the soap get into the child's eyes, which is one of the\r\nmost frequent causes of sore eyes in infants. The navel-string is now to\r\nbe dressed. This is done by wrapping it up in a circular piece of soft\r\nmuslin, well oiled, with a hole in its centre. The bandage is next to be\r\napplied. The object of its use is to protect the child's abdomen against\r\ncold, and to keep the dressing of the cord in its position. The nature,\r\nshape, and size of the binder have been described. It should be pinned\r\nin front, three pins being generally sufficient. The rest of the\r\nclothing before enumerated is then put on.\r\n\r\nThe child is now to be _applied to the breast at once_. This is to be\r\ndone, for three reasons. First, it very often prevents flooding, which\r\nis apt otherwise to occur. Secondly, it tends to prevent milk fever, by\r\naverting the violent rush of the milk on the third day, and the\r\nconsequent engorgement of the breast and constitutional disturbance.\r\nThe third reason is, that there is always a secretion in the breast from\r\nthe first, which it is desirable for the child to have; for it acts as a\r\ncathartic, stimulating the liver, and cleansing the bowels from the\r\nsecretions which fill them at the time of birth. There is generally\r\nsufficient nourishment in the breasts for the child for the first few\r\ndays. The mother may lie on the one side or the other, and receive the\r\nchild upon the arm of that upon which she is lying. If the nipple be not\r\nperfectly drawn out so that the child can grasp it in its mouth, the\r\ndifficulty may be overcome by filling a porter-bottle with hot water,\r\nemptying it, and then placing the mouth of the bottle immediately over\r\nthe nipple. This will cause, as the bottle cools, a sufficient amount of\r\nsuction to elevate the sunken nipple. The bottle should then be removed\r\nand the child substituted,--a little sugar and water or sweetened milk\r\nbeing applied, if necessary, to tempt the child to take the breast.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER ATTENTION TO THE MOTHER.\r\n\r\nThe patient should be cleansed every _four or five hours_. A soft\r\nnapkin, wet with warm soap and water, should for this purpose be passed\r\nunderneath the bed-clothing, without exposing the surface to a draft of\r\nair. After using the soap and water, apply again the dilute claret wine\r\nand the goose grease. Much of the safety of the mother depends upon the\r\nobservation of cleanliness. The napkin should not be allowed to remain\r\nso long as to become saturated with the discharges.\r\n\r\nThe mother should maintain rigidly the recumbent position for the first\r\nfew days, not raising her shoulders from the pillow for any purpose, and\r\nshould abstain from receiving visitors, and from any social conversation\r\nfor the first twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nFor the first three or four days, until the milk has come and the milk\r\nfever passed, the mother should live upon light food,--oatmeal gruel,\r\ntea and toast, panada, or anything else of little bulk and unstimulating\r\ncharacter. Afterwards the diet may be increased by the addition of\r\nchicken, lamb, mutton or oyster broth, buttered toast, and eggs. The\r\nobject of light nourishment at first is to prevent the too rapid\r\nsecretion of milk, which might be attended with evil local and\r\nconstitutional effects. If, however, the mother be in feeble health, it\r\nwill be necessary from the outset that she shall be supported with\r\nnourishing concentrated food. _Beef-tea_ will then be found very\r\nserviceable, particularly if made according to the following\r\nrecipe:--Take a pound of fresh beef from the loins or neck. Free it\r\ncarefully from all fat. Cut it up into fine pieces, and add a very\r\nlittle salt and five grains of unbroken black pepper. Pour on it a pint\r\nof cold water, and _simmer_ for forty minutes. Then pour off the liquor,\r\nplace the meat in a cloth, and, after squeezing the juice from it into\r\nthe tea, throw it aside. Return to the fire, and boil for ten minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter the first week, the diet of the lying-in woman should always be\r\nnutritious, though plain and simple. The development of the mammary\r\nglands, the production of the mammary secretion, and the reduction which\r\ntakes place in the size of the womb, all require increased nourishment,\r\nthat they may be properly performed.\r\n\r\nAfter the third or fourth day _the dress should be changed_. The dress\r\nworn during labor, if our directions have been carried out, will not\r\nhave been soiled. The clothing should be changed without uncovering the\r\nperson, and without raising the head from the pillow. Pull the bed-gown\r\nfrom over each arm, and draw it out from under the body. Then unfasten\r\nthe chemise in front and draw it down underneath her so that it can be\r\nremoved from below, as it should not be carried over the head. Place her\r\narms in the sleeves of the clean chemise, throw its body over her head,\r\nand, without lifting her shoulders from the bed, draw it down. Then\r\nchange the bed-gown in the same manner.\r\n\r\nIn changing the upper sheet, it should be pulled off from below, and the\r\nclean one carried down in its place from above, underneath the other\r\nclothing, which can be readily accomplished by plaiting the lower half.\r\nIn introducing a clean under-sheet, one side of it should be plaited and\r\nplaced under the patient, lying on her left side; when she turns on her\r\nback, the plaits can then be readily drawn out. These directions, though\r\napparently trivial, are important. The object is to guard against the\r\ngreat danger to which the mother is exposed by sitting up in bed for\r\neven a few minutes during the first week.\r\n\r\n_Cathartic medicine_ should not be administered the first, the third, or\r\nany other day after confinement, unless it is needed. If the patient is\r\nperfectly comfortable, has no pain in the abdomen, no headache, and is\r\nwell in every respect, she should be let alone, even if her bowels have\r\nnot been moved. If a laxative be called for, citrate of magnesia is much\r\npleasanter and equally as efficacious as the castor-oil so frequently\r\nadministered on this occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HAVE LABOR WITHOUT PAIN.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to avoid the throes of labor, and have children without\r\nsuffering? This is a question which science answers in the affirmative.\r\nMedical art brings the waters of Lethe to the bedside of woman in her\r\nhour of trial. Of late years chloroform and ether have been employed to\r\nlessen or annul the pains of childbirth, with the same success that has\r\nattended their use in surgery. Their administration is never pushed so\r\nas to produce complete unconsciousness, unless some operation is\r\nnecessary, but merely so as to diminish sensibility and render the pains\r\nendurable. These agents are thus given without injury to the child, and\r\nwithout retarding the labor or exposing the mother to any danger. When\r\nproperly employed, they induce refreshing sleep, revive the drooping\r\nnervous system, and expedite the delivery.\r\n\r\nThey should never be used in the absence of the doctor. He alone is\r\ncompetent to give them with safety. In natural, easy, and short labor,\r\nwhere the pains are readily borne, they are not required. But in those\r\nlingering cases in which the suffering is extreme, and, above all, in\r\nthose instances where instruments have to be employed, ether and\r\nchloroform have a value beyond all price.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORTALITY OF CHILDBED.\r\n\r\n_The number of the pregnancy_ affects the danger to be expected from\r\nlying-in. It has been declared by excellent authority, that the\r\nmortality of first labors, and of childbed fever following first labors\r\nis about twice the mortality attending all subsequent labors\r\ncollectively. After the ninth labor the mortality increases with the\r\nnumber. A woman having a large family, therefore, comes into greater and\r\nincreasing risk as she bears her ninth and successive children.\r\n\r\n_The age of the woman_ also affects the mortality accompanying\r\nconfinement. The age of least mortality is near twenty-five years. On\r\neither side of this, mortality increases with the diminution or increase\r\nof age. The age of the greatest safety in confinement therefore\r\ncorresponds to the age of greatest fecundity. And during the whole of\r\nchild-bearing life, safety in labor is directly as fecundity, and _vice\r\nversâ_. Hence modern statistics prove the correctness of the saying of\r\nAristotle, that 'to the female sex premature wedlock is peculiarly\r\ndangerous, since, in consequence of anticipating the demands of nature,\r\nmany of them suffer greatly in childbirth, and many of them die.' As the\r\nperiod from twenty to twenty-five is the least dangerous for childbirth,\r\nand as first labors are more hazardous than all others before the ninth,\r\nit is important that this term of least mortality be chosen for entering\r\nupon the duties of matrimony. This we have already pointed out in\r\nspeaking of the age of nubility.\r\n\r\n_The sex of the child_ is another circumstance affecting the mortality\r\nof labor. Professor Simpson of Edinburgh has shown that a greater\r\nproportion of deaths occurs in women who have brought forth male\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n_The duration of labor_ also influences the mortality of lying-in. The\r\nfatality increases with the length of the labor. It must be recollected,\r\nhowever, that the duration of labor is only an inconsiderable part of\r\nthe many causes of mortality in childbirth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHT AND LENGTH OF NEW-BORN CHILDREN\r\n\r\nThe average weight of infants of both sexes at the time of birth is\r\nabout seven pounds. The average of male children is seven and one-third\r\npounds; of female, six and two-thirds pounds. Children which at full\r\nterm weigh less than five pounds are not apt to thrive, and usually die\r\nin a short time.\r\n\r\nThe average length at birth, without regard to sex, is about twenty\r\ninches, the male being about half an inch longer than the female.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the relation between the size of the child and the age of\r\nthe mother, the interesting conclusion has been arrived at, that the\r\naverage weight and length of the mature child gradually increases with\r\nthe age of the mother up to the twenty-fifth year. Mothers between the\r\nages of twenty-five and twenty-nine have the largest children. From the\r\nthirtieth year they gradually diminish. The first child of a woman is of\r\ncomparatively light weight. The first egg of a fowl is smaller than\r\nthose which follow.\r\n\r\nThe new-born children in our Western States seem to be larger than the\r\nstatistics show them to be in the various States of Europe, and\r\napparently even than in our Eastern States. In the Report on Obstetrics\r\nof the Illinois State Medical Society for 1868, it is stated that\r\nQuincy, Ill., produced during the year six male children whose average\r\nweight at birth was thirteen and a quarter pounds, the smallest weighing\r\ntwelve pounds, and the largest seventeen and a half, which was born at\r\nthe end of four hours' labor, without instrumental or other\r\ninterference. A recent number of a Western medical journal reports the\r\nbirth at Detroit, in February last, of a well-formed male infant\r\ntwenty-four and a-half inches long, weighing sixteen pounds. The woman's\r\nweight, _after labor_, is stated as only ninety-two pounds. An English\r\nphysician delivered a child by the forceps which weighed seventeen\r\npounds twelve ounces, and measured twenty-four inches. These are the\r\nlargest well-authenticated new-born infants on record.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF LABOR.\r\n\r\nThe length of a natural labor may be said to vary between two and\r\neighteen hours. The intervals between the pains are such, however, that\r\nthe actual duration of suffering, even in the longest labor, is\r\ncomparatively very short. The first confinement is much longer than\r\nsubsequent ones.\r\n\r\nThe _sex_ of the child has some influence on the duration of labor.\r\nAccording to Dr. Collins of the Lying-in Hospital of Dublin, the average\r\nwith _male_ births is one hour and four minutes longer than with\r\n_female_. The _weight_ of the child also affects the time of labor.\r\nChildren weighing over eight pounds average four hours and eight minutes\r\nlonger in birth than those of less than eight pounds weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILL-BIRTHS.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of nearly fifty thousand deliveries which occurred at the\r\nRoyal Maternity Charity, London, show a percentage of nearly five\r\nstill-born, or one in twenty-seven.\r\n\r\nThere are more boys still-born than girls. We have already spoken of the\r\nfact that male births are more tedious, and that a larger number of\r\nmales die in the first few years of life than females. This series of\r\nmisfortunes has been attributed to the large size which the male foetus\r\nat birth possesses over the female.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPRUDENCE AFTER CHILDBIRTH.\r\n\r\nAfter the birth of the child at full term, or at any other period of\r\npregnancy, the womb, which had attained such wonderful proportions in a\r\nfew months, begins to resume its former size. This process requires at\r\nleast six weeks after labor for its full accomplishment. Rest is\r\nessential during this period. A too early return to the ordinary active\r\nduties of life retards or checks this restoration to normal size, and\r\nthe womb being heavier, exposes the woman to great danger of uterine\r\ndisplacements. Nor are these the only risks incurred by a too hasty\r\nrenewal of active movements. The surface, the substance, and the lining\r\nmembrane of the womb are all very liable, while this change from its\r\nincreased to its ordinary bulk is occurring, to take on inflammation\r\nafter slight exposure. The worst cases of uterine inflammation and\r\nulceration are thus caused. A 'bad getting-up,' prolonged debility,\r\npain, and excessive discharge, are among the least penalties consequent\r\nupon imprudence after confinement. It is a mistake to suppose that\r\nhard-working women in the lower walks of life attend with impunity to\r\ntheir ordinary duties a few days after confinement. Those who suffer\r\nmost from falling of the womb and other displacements are the poor, who\r\nare obliged to get up on the ninth day and remain upright, standing or\r\nwalking for many hours with an over-weighted womb. Every physician who\r\nhas practised much among the poor, has remarked upon the great frequency\r\nof diseases of the womb, which is to be attributed to the neglect of\r\nrest, so common among them, after childbirth. If this be true of\r\nvigorous women accustomed to a hardy life, how much more apt to suffer\r\nfrom this cause are the delicately nurtured, whose systems are already,\r\nperhaps, deteriorated, and little able to resist any deleterious\r\ninfluences!\r\n\r\nA mother should remain in bed for at least two weeks after the birth of\r\nthe child, and should not return to her household duties under a month;\r\nshe should also take great pains to protect herself from cold, so as to\r\nescape the rheumatic affections to which at this time she is\r\nparticularly subject. If these directions were generally observed, there\r\nwould be less employment for physicians with diseases peculiar to\r\nwomen, and fewer invalids in our homes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE THE FORM AFTER CHILDBIRTH.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of great anxiety with many women; and it is proper that\r\nit should be, for a flabby, pendulous abdomen is not only destructive to\r\ngrace of movement and harmony of outline, but is a positive\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nTo avoid it, be careful not to leave the bed too early. If the walls of\r\nthe abdomen are much relaxed, the bed should be kept from two to three\r\nweeks. Gentle frictions daily with spirits and water will give tone to\r\nthe muscles. But the most important point is to wear for several months\r\na _well-fitting_ bandage--not a towel pinned around the person, but a\r\nbody-case of strong linen, cut bias, setting snugly to the form, but not\r\nexerting unpleasant pressure. The pattern for this has already been\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_MATERNAL DUTIES AND PRIVILEGES._\r\n\r\nIt has been well said by Madame Sirey, that women who comprehend well\r\ntheir rights and duties as mothers of families, certainly cannot\r\ncomplain of their destiny. If there exists any inequality in the means\r\nof pleasure accorded to the two sexes, it is in favor of the woman. The\r\nmother who lives in her children and her grandchildren has the peculiar\r\nprivilege of not knowing the grief of becoming old.\r\n\r\n'So low down in the scale of creation as we can go,' says Professor\r\nLaycock of Edinburgh, 'wherever there is a discoverable distinction of\r\nsex, we find that maternity is the first and most fundamental duty of\r\nthe female. The male never in a single instance, in any organism,\r\nwhether plant or animal, contributes nutrient material.'\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans, it was enacted that married women who had borne three\r\nchildren, or if freed-women, four, had special privileges of their own\r\nin cases of inheritance, and were exempted from tutelage. Juvenal has\r\nrecorded the reverence paid in Rome to the newly-made mother, and the\r\nsign by which her house was designated and protected from rude\r\nintruders, namely, by the suspension of wreaths over the door.\r\n\r\nAt various times, and in different countries, legislators have made laws\r\ndiscriminating in favor of matrons, justly regarding the family as the\r\nsource of the wealth and prosperity of the State.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. granted, by the edict of 1666, certain pensions to parents of\r\nten children, with an increase for those who had twelve or more.\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSING.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the infant is born, it ought to be placed at the breast. From\r\nthis source it should receive its _only_ nourishment during the first\r\nfour or six months, and in many cases the first year, of its life. The\r\nchild which the mother has carried for nine months and brought with\r\nsuffering into the world, still depends upon her for its existence. At\r\nthe moment of its birth her duties to the infant, instead of ceasing,\r\naugment in importance. The obligation is imposed upon her of nourishing\r\nit with _her own_ milk, unless there are present physical conditions\r\nrendering nursing improper, of which we are about to speak. It is well\r\nknown that the artificial feeding of infants is a prominent cause of\r\nmortality in early life. The foundlings of large cities furnish the most\r\nstriking and convincing proof of the great advantages of nursing over\r\nthe use of artificially-prepared food. On the continent of Europe, in\r\nLyons and Parthenay, where foundlings are wet-nursed from the time they\r\nare received, the deaths are 33.7 and 35 per cent. In Paris, Rheims, and\r\nAix, where they are wholly dry-nursed, their deaths are 50.3, 63.9, and\r\n80 per cent. In New York city, the foundlings, numbering several hundred\r\na year, were, until recently, dry-nursed, with the fearful and almost\r\nincredible mortality of nearly one hundred per cent. The employment of\r\nwet-nurses has produced a much more favorable result. Therefore, if for\r\nany reason the mother cannot nurse her own child, a hired wet-nurse\r\nshould be procured. This brings us to the consideration of\r\n\r\n\r\nHINDRANCES TO NURSING, AND WHEN IT IS IMPROPER.\r\n\r\nWomen who have never suckled often experience difficulty in nursing, on\r\naccount of the sunken and flat condition of the nipple. We have pointed\r\nout the causes of this depression, and how by early attention before the\r\nbirth of the infant it may be prevented. If, however, these precautions\r\nhave been neglected, and it is found that the nipple is not sufficiently\r\nprominent to be grasped by the child's mouth, it may be drawn out by a\r\ncommon breast-pump, by suction with a tobacco-pipe, by the use of the\r\nhot-water bottle in the manner described, or by the application of an\r\ninfant a little older. Neither the child nor the mother should be\r\nconstantly fretted in such cases by frequent ineffectual attempts at\r\nnursing. Such unremitting attention and continual efforts produce\r\nnervousness and loss of sleep, and result in a diminution of the\r\nquantity of the milk. The child should not be put to the breast oftener\r\nthan once in an hour and a half or two hours. By the use of the\r\nexpedients mentioned, the whole difficulty will be overcome in a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n_Delay in applying the child to the breast_ is a common cause of\r\ntrouble. After it has been fed for several days with the spoon or\r\nbottle, it will often refuse to suck. When nursing is deferred, the\r\nnipple also becomes tender. For these reasons, as well as the others\r\ndetailed in our directions for the care of the new-born infant, the\r\nchild should always, in say from two to three hours after labor, be\r\nplaced at the breast.\r\n\r\n_Ulcerated and fissured nipples_ should be treated by the doctor in\r\nattendance. As it is highly desirable, and nearly always possible, to\r\navoid them, we would again call attention to the manner of doing so,\r\nindicated in a previous article. Fissured nipples sometimes do harm to\r\nthe infant, by causing it to swallow blood, disturbing in this way the\r\ndigestion. But all these local interferences with nursing can generally\r\nbe obviated in the course of a few weeks, and rarely entirely prevent\r\nthe exercise of this maternal pleasure and duty.\r\n\r\nBut there are certain _physical conditions which necessitate the\r\nemployment of a hired wet-nurse_, or weaning. If the mother belongs to a\r\nconsumptive family, and is herself pale, emaciated, harassed by a cough,\r\nand exhausted by suckling, wet-nursing is eminently improper. A\r\ntemporary loss of strength under other circumstances should not induce a\r\nmother at once to wean her child; for it is often possible, by the\r\njudicious use of tonics, nourishing food, and stimulants, to entirely\r\nrestore the health with the child at the breast. It should always be\r\nrecollected, however, that the milk of those in decidedly infirm health\r\nis incapable of properly nourishing the child. Professor J. Lewis Smith\r\nof New York quotes, in his recent work on Diseases of Children, several\r\ninstructive cases which show the danger sometimes attending suckling,\r\nand which may imperatively demand its discontinuance. 'A very\r\nlight-complexioned young mother, in very good health, and of a good\r\nconstitution, though somewhat delicate, was nursing for the third time,\r\nand, as regarded the child, successfully. All at once this young woman\r\nexperienced a feeling of exhaustion. Her skin became constantly hot;\r\nthere were cough, oppression, night-sweats; her strength visibly\r\ndeclined, and in less than a fortnight she presented the ordinary\r\nsymptoms of consumption. The nursing was immediately abandoned, and from\r\nthe moment the secretion of milk had ceased, all the troubles\r\ndisappeared.' Again: 'A woman of forty years of age having lost, one\r\nafter another, several children, all of which she had put out to nurse,\r\ndetermined to nurse the last one herself. This woman being vigorous and\r\nwell built, was eager for the work, and, filled with devotion and\r\nspirit, she gave herself up to the nursing of her child with a sort of\r\nfury. At nine months she still nursed him from fifteen to twenty times a\r\nday. Having become extremely emaciated, she fell all at once into a\r\nstate of weakness, from which nothing could raise her, and two days\r\nafter the poor woman died of exhaustion.'\r\n\r\nIt does not always follow, that because the mother is sick the child\r\nshould be taken from the breast. It is only necessary in those\r\naffections in which there is great depression of the vital powers, or\r\nin which there is danger of communicating the disease to the child. In\r\nthe city, where artificially-fed infants run great risks, extreme\r\ncaution should be exercised in early weaning.\r\n\r\n_Inflammation of either of the breasts_ necessitates the removal of the\r\ninfant from the affected side, and its restriction to the other. As the\r\ninflammation gets well and the milk reappears, the first of it should\r\nalways be rejected, as it is apt to be thick and stringy, after which\r\nnursing may be resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES FOR NURSING.\r\n\r\nThe new-born child should be nursed about every second hour during the\r\nday, and not more than once or twice at night. Too much ardor may be\r\ndisplayed by the young mother in the performance of her duties. Not\r\nknowing the fact that an infant quite as frequently cries from being\r\noverfed as from want of nourishment, she is apt to give it the breast at\r\nevery cry, day and night. In this manner her health is broken down, and\r\nshe is compelled perhaps to wean her child, which, with more prudence\r\nand knowledge, she might have continued to nurse without detriment to\r\nherself. It is particularly important that the child shall acquire the\r\nhabit of not requiring the breast more than once or twice at night.\r\nThis, with a little perseverance, can readily be accomplished, so that\r\nthe hours for rest at night, so much needed by the mother, may not be\r\ninterfered with. Indeed, if the mother does not enjoy good health, it is\r\nbetter for her not to nurse at all at night, but to have the child fed\r\nonce or twice with a little cow's milk. For this purpose, take the\r\nupper third of the milk which has stood for several hours and dilute it\r\nwith water, in the proportion of one part of milk to two of water.\r\n\r\nIn those cases in which the milk of the mother habitually disagrees with\r\nthe infant, the attention of the doctor should at once be called to the\r\ncircumstance. A microscopic examination will reveal to the intelligent\r\npractitioner the cause of the difficulty, and suggest the remedy.\r\n\r\nIt may be well here to mention--as, judging from the practice of many\r\nnurses and mothers, it seems to be a fact not generally known or\r\nattended to--that human milk contains _all that is required_ for the\r\ngrowth and repair of the various parts of the child's body. It should\r\ntherefore be the sole food in early infancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF DIET ON THE MOTHER'S MILK.\r\n\r\nCertain articles of food render the milk acid, and thus induce colicky\r\npains and bowel complaints in the child. Such, therefore, as are found,\r\nin each individual case, to produce indigestion and an acid stomach in\r\nthe mother, should be carefully avoided by her.\r\n\r\n_Retention of the milk in the breasts_ alters its character. The longer\r\nit is retained, the weaker and more watery it becomes. An acquaintance\r\nwith this fact is of practical importance to every mother; for it\r\nfollows from it, that the milk is richer the oftener it is removed from\r\nthe breast. Therefore, if the digestion of the child is disordered by\r\nthe milk being too rich, as sometimes happens, the remedy is to give it\r\nthe breast less frequently by which not only is less taken, but the\r\nquality is also rendered poorer. On the contrary, in those instances in\r\nwhich the child is badly nourished and the milk is insufficient in\r\nquantity, it should be applied oftener, and the milk thus rendered\r\nricher.\r\n\r\nThe milk which last flows is always the richest. Hence, when two\r\nchildren are nursed, the first is the worse served.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF PREGNANCY ON THE MILK.\r\n\r\nMenstruation is ordinarily absent, and pregnancy therefore impossible,\r\nduring the whole course of nursing, at least during the first nine\r\nmonths. Sometimes, however, mothers become unwell at the expiration of\r\nthe sixth or seventh month; in rare instances, within the first five or\r\nsix weeks after confinement. When the monthly sickness makes its\r\nappearance without any constitutional or local disturbance, it is not\r\napt to interfere with the welfare of the infant. When, on the contrary,\r\nthe discharge is profuse, and attended with much pain, it may produce\r\ncolic, vomiting, and diarrhoea in the nursling. The disturbance in the\r\nsystem of the child ordinarily resulting from pregnancy in the mother is\r\nsuch that, as a rule, it should be at once weaned so soon as it is\r\ncertain that pregnancy exists. The only exceptions to this rule are\r\nthose cases in the city, during the hot months, in which it is\r\nimpossible either to procure a wet-nurse or to take the child to the\r\ncountry to be weaned. In cold weather an infant should certainly be\r\nweaned, if it has attained its fifth or sixth month, and the mother has\r\nbecome pregnant.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE MOTHER'S MIND OVER THE NURSING CHILD.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken, in treating of mothers' marks, of the influence of the\r\nmother's mind upon her unborn offspring. The influence of the maternal\r\nmind does not cease with the birth of the child. The mother continues\r\nduring the whole period of nursing powerfully to impress, through her\r\nmilk, the babe at her breast. It is well established, that mental\r\nemotions are capable of changing the quantity and quality of the milk,\r\nand of thus rendering it hurtful, and even dangerous, to the infant.\r\n\r\n_The secretion of milk may be entirely stopped_ by the action of the\r\nnervous system. Fear, excited on account of the child which is sick or\r\nexposed to accident, will check the flow of milk, which will not return\r\nuntil the little one is restored in safety to the mother's arms.\r\nApprehension felt in regard to a drunken husband, has been known to\r\narrest the supply of this fluid. On the other hand, the secretion is\r\noften augmented, as every mother knows, by the _sight_ of the child,\r\nnay, even by the _thought_ of him, causing a sudden rush of blood to the\r\nbreast known to nurses as the _draught_. Indeed a strong desire to\r\nfurnish milk, together with the application of the child to the breast,\r\nhas been effectual in bringing about its secretion in young girls, old\r\nwomen, and even men.\r\n\r\nSir Astley Cooper states that 'those passions which are generally\r\nsources of pleasure, and which when moderately indulged are conducive to\r\nhealth, will, when carried to excess, alter, and even entirely check the\r\nsecretion of milk.'\r\n\r\nBut the fact which it is most important to know is, that _nervous\r\nagitation may so alter the quality of the milk as to make it poisonous_.\r\nA fretful temper, fits of anger, grief, anxiety of mind, fear, and\r\nsudden terror, not only lessen the quantity of the milk, but render it\r\nthin and unhealthful, inducing disturbances of the child's bowels,\r\ndiarrhoea, griping, and fever. Intense mental emotion may even so alter\r\nthe milk as to cause the death of the child. A physician states, in the\r\n_Lancet_, that, having removed a small tumour from behind the ear of a\r\nmother, all went on well until she fell into a violent passion. The\r\nchild being suckled soon afterwards, it died in convulsions. Professor\r\nCarpenter records in his Physiology two other fatal instances: in one,\r\nthe infant put to the breast immediately after the receipt of\r\ndistressing news by the mother, died in her arms in the presence of the\r\nmessenger of the ill-tidings; in the other, the infant was seized with\r\nconvulsions on the right side and paralysis on the left, on sucking\r\ndirectly after the mother had met with an agitating occurrence. Another\r\ncase of similar character may be mentioned. A woman while nursing became\r\nviolently excited on account of a loss she had just met with from a\r\ntheft. She gave her child the breast while in an intense passion. The\r\nchild first refused, but ultimately took it, when severe vomiting\r\noccurred. In the course of some hours the child took the other breast,\r\nwas attacked at once with violent convulsions, and died in spite of all\r\nthat could be done for it.\r\n\r\nThe following cases are related by Professor Carpenter as occurring\r\nwithin his own knowledge. They are valuable as a warning to nursing\r\nmothers to avoid all exciting or depressing passions. A mother of\r\nseveral healthy children, of whom the youngest was a vigorous infant a\r\nfew months old, heard of the death from convulsions of the infant child\r\nof an intimate friend at a distance, whose family had increased in the\r\nsame manner as her own. The unfortunate circumstance made a strong\r\nimpression on her mind, and being alone with her babe, separated from\r\nthe rest of her family, she dwelt upon it more than she otherwise would\r\nhave done. With her mind thus occupied, one morning, shortly after\r\nnursing her infant, she laid it in its cradle, asleep and apparently in\r\nperfect health. Her attention was soon attracted to it by a noise. On\r\ngoing to the cradle she found it in a convulsion, which lasted only a\r\nfew moments, and left it dead. In the other case, the mother had lost\r\nseveral children in early infancy, from fits. One infant alone survived\r\nthe usually fatal period. While nursing him, one morning she dwelt\r\nstrongly upon the fear of losing him also, although he appeared to be a\r\nvery healthy child. The infant was transferred to the arms of the nurse.\r\nWhile the nurse was endeavouring to cheer the mother by calling her\r\nattention to the thriving appearance of her child, he was seized with a\r\nconvulsion, and died almost instantly in her arms. Under similar\r\ncircumstances, a child should not be nursed by its mother, but by one\r\nwho has reared healthy children of her own and has a tranquil mind.\r\n\r\nAn interesting illustration of the powerful sedative action of the\r\nmother's milk--changed in consequence of great mental distress--upon the\r\nimpressible nervous system of the infant, is furnished by a German\r\nphysician. 'A carpenter fell into a quarrel with a soldier billeted in\r\nhis house, and was set upon by the latter with his drawn sword. The wife\r\nof the carpenter at first trembled from fear and terror, and then\r\nsuddenly threw herself furiously between the combatants, wrested the\r\nsword from the soldier's hand, broke it in pieces, and threw it away.\r\nDuring the tumult, some neighbors came in and separated the men. While\r\nin this state of strong excitement, the mother took up her child from\r\nthe cradle, where it lay playing and in the most perfect health, never\r\nhaving had a moment's illness. She gave it the breast, and in so doing\r\nsealed its fate. In a few minutes the infant left off sucking, became\r\nrestless, panted, and sank dead upon its mother's bosom. The physician,\r\nwho was instantly called in, found the child lying in the cradle as if\r\nasleep, and with its features undisturbed; but all his resources were\r\nfruitless. It was irrevocably gone.'\r\n\r\nProfessor William A. Hammond of New York mentions, in a recent number of\r\nthe _Journal of Psychological Medicine_, several instances, from his own\r\npractice, of affections in the child caused by the mother's milk. 'A\r\nsoldier's wife, whilst nursing her child, was very much terrified by a\r\nsudden thunderstorm, during which the house where she was then quartered\r\nwas struck by lightning. The infant, which had always been in excellent\r\nhealth, was immediately attacked with vomiting and convulsions, from\r\nwhich it recovered with difficulty.' 'A lady, three weeks after\r\ndelivery, was attacked with puerperal insanity. She nursed her child but\r\nonce after the accession of the disease, and in two hours subsequently\r\nit was affected with general convulsions, from which it died during the\r\nnight. Previous to this event it had been in robust health.'\r\n\r\nAgain, Dr. Seguin of New York relates, in his work on Idiocy, a number\r\nof cases of _loss of mind_ produced by the altered state of the mother's\r\nmilk. 'Mrs. B. came out from a ball-room, gave the breast to her baby,\r\nthree months old: he was taken with spasms two hours after, and since is\r\na confirmed idiot and epileptic.'\r\n\r\n'In a moment of great anxiety Mrs. C. jumped into a carriage with her\r\nsuckling, a girl of fifteen months, so far very intelligent and\r\nattractive. The child took the breast only once in a journey of twenty\r\nmiles, but before arriving at destination she vomited several times,\r\nwith no interruption but that of stupor, and after an acute fever the\r\nlittle girl settled down into the condition of a cripple and idiot.'\r\n\r\nThe celebrated physician Boerhaave mentions the milk of an angry nurse\r\nas among the causes of _epilepsy._\r\n\r\nThese facts show the importance of a placid mind and cheerful temper in\r\nthe mother while nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE MOTHER WHILE NURSING.\r\n\r\nThe habit of nursing a child while sitting up in bed or half reclining\r\nupon a lounge is a wrong one. Such a position is injurious to the\r\nbreasts, hurtful to the woman's figure, and apt to cause backache. When\r\nin bed, the mother ought always to be recumbent while the child is at\r\nthe breast, held upon the arm of the side upon which she lies. When out\r\nof bed, she should sit upright while nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUANTITY OF MILK REQUIRED BY THE INFANT.\r\n\r\nThe amount of milk furnished every day by a healthy woman has been\r\nestimated at from a quart to three pints. An infant one or two months of\r\nage takes about two wine-glassfuls, or three ounces, every meal; that\r\nis, as it sucks every two hours, excepting when asleep, about five\r\nhalf-pints during the twenty-four hours. When it attains the age of\r\nthree months, it thrives well on five meals a day, the quantity taken at\r\neach meal then, the stomach being more capacious, amounting to about\r\nhalf a pint. A child above three months of age ordinarily requires three\r\npints daily.\r\n\r\nA healthy mother is fully capable of furnishing this quantity of milk\r\nper day, and of affording the child all the nourishment it needs until\r\nfour or six months after birth.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of the mother's milk varies according to many\r\ncircumstances. It is most abundant and also most nutritious in nursing\r\nwomen between the ages of fifteen and thirty; least so, in those from\r\nthirty-five to forty. There is likewise a great difference in different\r\nwomen in this respect; and in the same woman varying conditions of\r\nhealth influence the amount of milk secreted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUALITIES OF A GOOD NURSING MOTHER\r\n\r\nare well described by Professor J. Lewis Smith. 'The best wet-nurses are\r\nusually robust, without being corpulent. Their appetite is good, and\r\ntheir breasts are distended, from the number and large size of the\r\nblood-vessels and milk-ducts. There is but a moderate amount of fat\r\naround the gland, and tortuous veins are observed passing over it. Such\r\nnurses do not experience a feeling of exhaustion, and do not suffer from\r\nlactation. The nutriment which they consume is equally expended on their\r\nown sustenance and the supply of milk. There are other good wet-nurses\r\nwho have the physical condition described, but whose breasts are small.\r\nStill the infant continues to suck till it is satisfied, and it thrives.\r\nThe milk is of good quality, and it appears to be secreted mainly during\r\nthe time of suckling. Other mothers evidently decline in health during\r\nthe time of nursing. They furnish milk of good quality and in abundance,\r\nand their infants thrive; but it is at their own expense. They\r\nthemselves say, and with truth, that what they eat goes to milk. They\r\nbecome thinner and paler, are perhaps troubled with palpitation, and are\r\neasily exhausted. They often find it necessary to wean before the end of\r\nthe usual period of lactation. There is another class whose health is\r\nhabitually poor, but who furnish the usual quantity of milk without the\r\nexhaustion experienced by the class just described. The milk of these\r\nwomen is of poor quality. It is abundant, but watery. Their infants are\r\npallid having soft and flabby fibre.'\r\n\r\n\r\nOVER-ABUNDANCE OF MILK.\r\n\r\nAn excessive amount of milk often distends the breasts of those women\r\nwho are prone to have long and profuse monthly sickness. It is also apt\r\nto occur in those subject to bleeding piles. It may be produced by any\r\nexcitement of the womb or ovaries, and by over-nursing. In these cases\r\nthere is usually a constant oozing away and consequent loss of milk. The\r\nmother is troubled by this over-flow, because it keeps her clothing wet;\r\nand the child suffers because of the unnutritious, watery character of\r\nthe milk under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis over-abundant supply may be moderated and the quality improved by\r\ndiminishing the quantity of drink, and by the use of preparations of\r\niron. Fifteen drops of the muriatic tincture of iron, taken three times\r\na day in a little sweetened water, through a glass tube, will be useful.\r\nIt will lessen the amount of the milk, and make it richer. So soon as\r\nthese objects are accomplished, the medicine should be discontinued; as,\r\nif taken too long, it may so much diminish the milk as to necessitate\r\nweaning. The application of a cloth, wrung out in cold water, around the\r\nnipples is also of value. It is to be removed so soon as it becomes\r\nwarm, and reapplied. In those cases in which the trouble seems to be not\r\nso much an over-supply as an inability to retain the milk, the\r\nadministration of tonics addressed to the nervous system, and the local\r\nuse of astringents and of collodion around the nipples, will overcome\r\nthe difficulty; but these remedies can only be employed successfully by\r\nthe physician. And to him alone should be entrusted the use of those\r\nmedicines which directly diminish the amount of milk secreted within the\r\nbreasts. The expedients we have mentioned are the only ones which can be\r\nsafely employed by the mother herself in this annoying affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCANTINESS OF MILK.\r\n\r\nSome mothers have habitually an insufficiency of milk. They are most\r\nnumerous in large cities, and among working women whose daily\r\noccupations require a separation from the infant. Indigestion, and the\r\nwant of a proper amount of nourishing food, cause a diminution in the\r\nquantity of milk. So also do over-feeding and gormandizing. Age lessens\r\nthe secretion of milk, as has been already mentioned. Those who first\r\nbear children late in life, have less milk for them than they who begin\r\nearlier. In some cases want of milk in the breasts seems to be due to\r\nits reabsorption. In such instances it may make its appearance at\r\ndistant parts. Thus, a case has been recorded of the coughing up of milk\r\nfollowing sudden arrest of the secretion, and others in which it\r\npresented itself as an exudation in the groins.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of a scanty formation of milk, one of the best measures\r\nwhich can be resorted to is the frequent application of the child to the\r\nbreast. In addition, the flow may be increased by milking the breasts by\r\nmeans of the thumb and finger, suction through a tobacco-pipe, or the\r\nbreast-pump, or by the use of another infant. Friction of the breasts,\r\nand forcible drawing upon the nipples, will make them sore, and so\r\nirritate them as to defeat the object in view. A change of scene, fresh\r\nair, and outdoor exercise, attention to personal cleanliness, and the\r\nimprovement of the general health, all increase the quantity, and\r\nproduce a favourable effect upon the quality, of the milk. A sojourn at\r\nthe sea-side often promotes an abundant secretion of milk. The diet\r\nshould be regulated by the condition of the constitution. By those who\r\nare weak and pale, a large proportion of meat is required. On the\r\ncontrary, those who are full-blooded and corpulent should restrict the\r\namount of their animal food, and take more exercise in the open air.\r\nOatmeal gruel enjoys a reputation for increasing the flow of milk. A\r\nbasin of it sometimes produces an immediate effect. The same is true of\r\ncow's milk. Porter or ale once or twice a day, in those with reduced\r\nsystems and impaired digestion and appetite, will be found useful.\r\nAnise, fennel, and caraway-seeds, given in soup, act sometimes as\r\nstimulants upon the secretion of milk. The application of a poultice\r\nmade from the pulverized leaves of the castor-oil plant is a most\r\nefficient remedy when milk fails to make its appearance in the breast in\r\nsufficient quantity after confinement.\r\n\r\n\r\nWET-NURSING BY VIRGINS, AGED WOMEN, AND MEN.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the secretion of milk is limited to one sex, and in that is\r\nconfined to a short period after childbirth. But there are many cases on\r\nrecord of the flowing of milk in women not recently mothers, in girls\r\nbefore the age of puberty, in aged women, and even in individuals of the\r\nmale sex. In such instances, the secretion is induced by the combined\r\ninfluence, acting through the nervous system, of a strong desire for its\r\noccurrence, of a fixed attention towards the mammary glands, and of\r\nsuction from the nipples.\r\n\r\nTravellers among savage nations report many examples of such unnatural\r\nnursing. Dr. Livingstone says he has frequently seen in Africa a\r\ngrandchild suckled by a grandmother. Dr. Wm. A. Gillespie, of Virginia\r\nrecords, in the _Boston Medical and Surgical Journal_, the case of a\r\nwidow, aged about sixty, whose daughter having died, leaving a child two\r\nmonths old, took the child and tried to raise it by feeding. The child's\r\nbowels became deranged, and being unable to procure a nurse, and her\r\nbreasts being large and full, he advised her to apply the child, in hopes\r\nmilk would come. She followed his advice perseveringly, and, to her\r\nastonishment, a plentiful secretion of milk was the result, with which\r\nshe nourished the child, which afterwards became strong and healthy. A\r\nsimilar instance, still more remarkable, is recorded of a woman at\r\nseventy years, who twenty years wet-nursed a grandchild after her last\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nCases of nursing in the opposite extreme of life are also well\r\nauthenticated. The distinguished French physician Baudelocque has\r\nrelated that of a deaf and dumb girl, eight years old, who, by the\r\nrepeated application to her breast of a young infant, which her mother\r\nwas suckling, had sufficient milk to nourish the child for a month,\r\nwhile the mother was unable to nurse it on account of sore nipples. The\r\nlittle girl was shown to the Royal Academy of Surgery on the 16th of\r\nFebruary, 1783. The quantity of milk was such, that by simply pressing\r\nthe breast it was made to flow out in the presence of the Academy, and\r\non the same day, at the house of Baudelocque, before a large class of\r\npupils. Again, an interesting case is known of a young woman, who, in\r\nconsequence of the habit of applying the infant of her mistress to her\r\nbreast in order to quiet it, caused a free secretion of milk. In the\r\nCape de Verde Islands, it is stated that virgins, old women, and even\r\nmen, are frequently employed as wet-nurses. Humboldt speaks of a man,\r\nthirty-two years old, who gave the breast to his child for five months.\r\nCaptain Franklin saw a similar case in the Arctic regions. Professor\r\nHall presented to his class in Baltimore a negro, fifty-five years old,\r\nwho had been the wet-nurse of all the children of his mistress.\r\n\r\nInstances of powers of _prolonged nursing_ in mothers are not uncommon.\r\nIndeed it is the habit among some nations to suckle children until they\r\nare three or four years of age, even though another pregnancy may\r\nintervene, so that immediately one child is succeeded at the breast by\r\nanother. In those who have thus unnaturally excited the mammary glands,\r\nan irrepressible flow sometimes continues after the demand for it has\r\nceased. Dr. Green published, some years ago, in the _New York Journal of\r\nMedicine and Surgery_, the case of a woman, aged forty-seven, the\r\nmother of five children, who had had an abundant supply of milk for\r\n_twenty-seven years_ consecutively. A period of exactly four years and a\r\nhalf occurred between each birth, and the children were permitted to\r\ntake the breast until they were running about at play. At the time when\r\nDr. G. wrote, she had been nine years a widow, and was obliged to have\r\nher breasts drawn daily, the secretion of milk being so copious. When,\r\ntherefore, it is desirable, on account of the feebleness of the child,\r\nto protract the period of nursing, a wet-nurse should relieve the mother\r\nat the end of twelve or fifteen months.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES FOR CARE OF HEALTH WHILE NURSING.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have previously said of the influence of the nervous system\r\nover the quantity and quality of the milk, and the instances we have\r\nadduced of the danger to the infant of all violent passions--such as\r\nanger, terror, anxiety, and grief--on the part of the mother, it will be\r\napparent that it is of the greatest moment, during the whole course of\r\nnursing, to maintain a tranquil state of mind. Pleasing and peaceful\r\nemotions favor the normal secretion of milk, and go far towards securing\r\nthe health of the child. When strongly affected by any powerful\r\nfeelings, mothers should not give the breast, but should wait until they\r\nhave calmed down to their usual tenor of temper. A case is related of a\r\nwoman who was always excited by a highly electrical state of the\r\natmosphere, and particularly during stormy weather. If when thus\r\ninfluenced she nursed her child he was sure to fall into convulsions;\r\nwhile, if she delayed doing so until this nervous excitement had passed,\r\nno unpleasant symptoms occurred. But we have already dwelt at length\r\nupon this subject in speaking of the influence of the mind of the mother\r\nover the child at her breast, and need not therefore recur to it. The\r\n_food_ while nursing must be nutritious and varied, though simple and\r\nunstimulating; and should consist both of meat and vegetables, soups,\r\nfish, flesh, and fowl, either in combination or succession. When the\r\ndigestion requires stimulation and aid, a glass of mild ale twice a day\r\nwill be useful. Wines, brandy, and whisky should not be taken without\r\nthe advice of a physician. Moderate exercise in the open air and regular\r\nhabits are necessary. A defective or excessive diet, fatigue, loss of\r\nrest at night, and irregularities and excesses of all kinds are\r\nunfavorable to mother and child. The proper methods of combating a\r\ntendency to over-abundance or to scantiness of milk have been alluded\r\nto. Medicines, unless prescribed by the medical attendant, should rarely\r\nor never be taken during this period, as many of them enter the milk and\r\nmay thus affect the child.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIONS OF HUSBAND AND WIFE DURING NURSING.\r\n\r\nAfter a natural and healthful confinement, the nurse usually remains\r\nwith the mother for a period of four weeks. During the whole of this\r\ntime the husband should occupy a separate apartment, and, according to\r\nsome physicians, this separation should be protracted during the entire\r\nperiod of nursing. But this is unusual, and in most cases unnecessary.\r\nOnly those women who are warned by the recurrence of their monthly\r\nillness that they are liable to another pregnancy immediately, should\r\ninsist on such an ascetic rule as this.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the quality of the milk is much deteriorated by a\r\nconception; and therefore, both in the interest of the mother and child,\r\nthe husband should renounce his usual privileges at such times.\r\n\r\nMost women do not have their periodical illness, and consequently are\r\nnot liable to a second pregnancy, before seven months have elapsed after\r\nchildbirth. There are, however, numerous exceptions to this rule, and it\r\nis impossible to foretell who will and who will not be the exception.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as any excitement of the passions alters to some extent the\r\nsecretion of the breasts, often to the injury of the child, it is every\r\nway advisable that great temperance be exercised in all cases in the\r\nmarital relations at these epochs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF OVER-NURSING.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of over-nursing may be enumerated as follows:--Aching pain\r\nin the back; often, pain across the shoulders, and on the top of the\r\nhead or forehead; marked paleness of the face; inability to sleep;\r\nfrightful dreams when sleep does come; great debility; extreme\r\ndepression of the spirits; disorders of the sight, and mental\r\ndisturbances, which take on the form of melancholia, the delusions\r\nrelating mostly to subjects of a religious character, to the effect that\r\nthe unpardonable sin has been committed, and the like. The headache is\r\nsituated on the top of the head, and this spot may be noticed to be\r\nperceptibly hotter to the touch than other parts of the head. These\r\nsymptoms indicate that the process of nursing is making too great a\r\ndrain upon the system.\r\n\r\nA woman in ordinary health will generally be able to suckle her child\r\nfor twelve months without experiencing any bad effects. When the child\r\nis kept at the breast much beyond this time, most mothers render\r\nthemselves liable to the injurious consequences we have mentioned. Some,\r\nindeed, cannot furnish the child all the nourishment it needs longer\r\nthan three or four months, without detriment to themselves. In such\r\ncases, by feeding the child two or three times a day, the mother may be\r\nrelieved of the burden of its entire support, and may thus be enabled to\r\ncontinue nursing. The proper food for infants, under these\r\ncircumstances, will be shortly mentioned. The prostrating effects of\r\nnursing upon the body and mind of the mother are in some, though\r\ncomparatively rare, instances so marked, as to render it altogether\r\nimproper from the commencement.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the condition of system described as resulting from\r\nover-nursing is, if it cannot be remedied by partially feeding the\r\ninfant and the use of tonics, to remove the child from the breast\r\naltogether, and either procure a wet-nurse for it, or wean it. The\r\nwet-nurse is greatly to be preferred; and the preference is the\r\nstronger, the younger the child. We have already alluded to the great\r\ndifficulty of rearing children from birth by the hand. But after the\r\ninfant has attained the age of several months, the danger of artificial\r\nfeeding is much lessened, provided that the weaning does not take place\r\nduring hot weather. This brings us to the consideration of the regimen\r\nof the mother who cannot nurse her own child, of the rules for the\r\nselection of a wet-nurse, of the directions for bringing up by hand, and\r\nof the proper method of weaning. These subjects we will now take up in\r\nthe order mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR MOTHERS WHO CANNOT NURSE THEIR OWN CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why a mother should, if possible, nurse her own\r\nchild. 'One of the principal is,' says the distinguished Dr. Tilt, 'that\r\nas nursing, generally speaking, prevents conception up to the tenth\r\nmonth, so it prevents the ruin of the mother's constitution by the too\r\nrapid bringing forth of children, and, we might even add, prevents a\r\ndeterioration of the race, by the imperfect bringing up of this\r\ntoo-fast-got family.'\r\n\r\nThe same author appropriately adds: 'But while advocating maternal\r\nnursing, we must not forget that woman is not now the Eve of a primeval\r\nworld; that human nature, wherever it is now met, in barbarous tribes or\r\nin civilised communities, is frequently so deteriorated, so diseased or\r\nprone to disease, that, by nursing, a mother may sometimes undermine her\r\nown frail constitution for the sake of giving an imperfect sustenance,\r\nand perhaps a poisonous heritage, to her babe.'\r\n\r\nSome mothers, however anxiously they may wish to do so, cannot nurse\r\ntheir children. They are shut out from this charming and tender\r\nexperience in the life of a woman. The milk that comes is not\r\nsufficient, and quickly disappears. Because of the influence of the mind\r\nof the mother over the child at her breast, to which we have before\r\ncalled attention, women who are very hysterical and nervous, subject to\r\nviolent perturbations of the mind, should not, particularly if there be\r\nany family tendency to insanity, expose the child to the mischievous\r\neffects latent in their milk. So, also, the presence of certain diseases\r\nforbids wet-nursing. Thus it is ordinarily prohibited by consumption,\r\nscrofula, skin affections of long standing, and cancer. In consumption,\r\nall efforts to suckle are frequently equally fatal to the mother and\r\nchild. Even a strong hereditary predisposition to this disease may\r\nrender it advisable, in the opinion of the family physician,--who should\r\nalways be consulted in such a case,--to counteract the family taint by\r\ngiving the milk of the healthiest nurse that can be procured. The\r\ncondition of the nipples and of the breast may not permit of nursing. We\r\nhave pointed out how best to guard against such an occurrence, in\r\ntreating of the care of the nipples during pregnancy.\r\n\r\nShe who is to be debarred from nursing her own child should take care\r\nthat it is not allowed to approach her breasts, as sometimes the mental\r\nand physical excitement caused by such an approach is of an injurious\r\nand lasting character.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, if this direction be followed out, the mother will have\r\nlittle trouble in regard to herself. Under such circumstances, the\r\nchief danger is to the child. Hence the importance of knowing\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO SELECT A WET-NURSE.\r\n\r\nThe choosing of a wet-nurse is a matter of great moment and\r\nresponsibility. She should not be over thirty years of age, and should,\r\nif possible, be one who has previously suckled and had charge of\r\nchildren. Her own infant should be under the age of six months, for when\r\nabove that age the milk sometimes disagrees with her new-born charge.\r\nOne who has had several children should be preferred, because her milk\r\nis richer than after the first confinement.\r\n\r\nThe doctor should always examine carefully into the condition of the\r\nnurse's health, and into the quality and quantity of her milk. Various\r\ndiseases and taints of the system are so hidden, while yet communicable\r\nto the child, that the knowledge and skill of a professional expert are\r\nrequired for their detection, and the protection of the nursling. In\r\ntesting the quality of the milk, the experienced physician allows a\r\nlittle to rest on his finger nail, and by its examination readily\r\ndecides as to its richness and fitness to nourish the little applicant\r\nfor food. It is not necessary that the breasts should be large, as those\r\nof moderate size often furnish a sufficient amount of milk. But it is\r\nimportant that the nipples should be well developed. Those wet-nurses\r\nshould be preferred in whom large blood-vessels are seen prominently\r\npassing in blue lines over the surface of the breasts. The possession of\r\na vigorous, healthful infant is a good recommendation for a nurse, but\r\ncare should be taken to ascertain that it is her _own_, as nurses have\r\nbeen known to borrow for such an occasion and so obtain credit not\r\njustly their due.\r\n\r\nThe moral and mental as well as physical characteristics should be\r\nconsidered. Temperance and cleanliness are indispensable in a wet-nurse,\r\nand the want of either should be an imperative reason for rejection.\r\nEquanimity of temper, cheerfulness, and an open, frank, affectionate\r\ndisposition, are of course greatly to be desired.\r\n\r\nIf the nurse becomes 'unwell,' shall the child be taken from her? Should\r\nthe monthly sickness reappear early, and both nurse and child be in good\r\nhealth, suckling may be continued. But when the return happens about the\r\nninth or tenth month, the child should be weaned or the nurse changed.\r\nThere is no physiological reason for preventing the nurse from living\r\nmatrimonially; but if pregnancy occurs, the child should be taken from\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe same rules that we have laid down for the mother for the care of her\r\nhealth while nursing, are of course applicable to the hired wet-nurse,\r\nand should be insisted upon and enforced.\r\n\r\n_Changing a nurse._--When it becomes necessary to change a nurse, for\r\nany of the reasons above mentioned, it may be done without injury to the\r\nchild. For fear of the effect of the unwelcome tidings upon the mind of\r\nthe nurse, and the possible influence upon the milk, she should not be\r\ninformed of the projected change until a successor has been secured to\r\ntake her place at once. In choosing the second nurse, the same\r\nprecautions should be had as in the selection of the first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHILD.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE CARE OF INFANCY._\r\n\r\nBy infancy we mean that portion of the life of the child between birth\r\nand the completion of the teething--about two and a half years. The care\r\nof this period of human life is entrusted to the mother. It forms an\r\nimportant era in the physical life of woman. Its discussion is therefore\r\ngermane to our subject. In order that the young mother may fully\r\nappreciate the responsibilities of her position, she should know\r\nsomething of the liability of infants to sickness and death.\r\n\r\nOut of one thousand children born, one hundred and fifty die within the\r\nfirst year, and one hundred and thirteen during the next four years.\r\nThus two hundred and sixty-three, or _more than one-fourth, die within\r\nfive years after birth_. Between the ages of five and ten, thirty-five\r\ndie. During the next five years eighteen more are recorded on the\r\ndeath-list. Hence, at fifteen years of age only six hundred and\r\neighty-five remain out of the one thousand born. When these figures are\r\nconsidered, and the additional fact that out of those who survive very\r\nmany bear permanent marks of imperfect nourishment or of actual disease,\r\nthe consequence of maladies contracted in early life, the importance of\r\nour present inquiry--the care of infancy--will be apparent to all\r\nmothers.\r\n\r\nThe younger the infant, the greater the danger of death. _One-tenth of\r\nall children born die within the first month after birth_, and four\r\ntimes as many as during the second month.\r\n\r\nThe mortality is much larger in cities than in the country. In Dublin,\r\nduring 1867, very nearly one-third of all the persons who died were\r\nunder five years of age. In the same year forty-three per cent. of those\r\nwho died in the eight principal towns of Scotland were children below\r\nthe age of five. In Philadelphia, during the same year, forty-five per\r\ncent. of all the deaths were of children under five years of age. In New\r\nYork fifty-three per cent. of the total number of deaths occur under the\r\nage of five years, and twenty-six per cent. under the age of one year.\r\n\r\nThe danger of death lessens as the period of puberty approaches. Yet,\r\neven in the last years of childhood there is a greater liability to\r\ndisease and a larger proportionate loss of life than during youth or\r\nmiddle age.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF INFANT MORTALITY.\r\n\r\nWhat are the causes of this startling mortality of infant life? Why does\r\none child out of ten die in the first month, and only three out of four\r\nlive to be five years old? And what are the means of prevention?\r\n\r\nSome of the causes which are active in producing this mortality among\r\nthe little ones cannot be successfully opposed after birth. Such, for\r\ninstance, are imperfect and vicious developments of internal organs\r\nexisting when born. These malformations often result from inflammation\r\nwhile in the womb, excited by some taint of the mother's blood, or by\r\nsome agitation of her nervous system. Means of prevention in those cases\r\nare therefore to be directed to the mother, in the manner indicated in\r\ntreating of pregnancy. But other causes of death begin to act only after\r\nbirth, and are to a greater or less extent avoidable. These are largely\r\ntraceable to ignorance, negligence, and vice.\r\n\r\nOne cause of death to which infants are peculiarly liable, and which\r\nalone is said to have destroyed forty thousand children in England\r\nbetween the years 1686 and 1799, is being _overlain_ by the parents. For\r\nthis reason, some physicians caution the mother against having the\r\ninfant in bed with her while she sleeps.\r\n\r\nThe frightful waste of life caused by bringing children up by hand has\r\nbeen mentioned, and the importance of avoiding it when possible.\r\n\r\nThe natural feebleness of the system of infants is the reason why they\r\nsuccumb so easily to any malady. Deaths from any given disease are more\r\nnumerous among infants than children, and among children than adults.\r\nHence the importance of timely corrective measures in infantile\r\naffections; hence, also, the need that mothers should know and practise\r\nthe means best adapted to preserve the health of their frail charges.\r\n\r\nThese means we shall proceed to give in detail, commencing with\r\ndirections for\r\n\r\n\r\nBRINGING UP BY HAND.\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded to the great danger to the child, particularly\r\nin a city, that is artificially fed from birth. But as there are many\r\nmothers who are unable, on account of the expense, to have a wet-nurse\r\nfor the child they cannot suckle themselves, we will give such\r\ndirections in regard to the diet as are best calculated to lessen the\r\nrisk invariably incurred under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe child's food should be of the best quality, and prepared with the\r\nmost scrupulous attention to cleanliness. The milk of the cow is\r\npreferable to that of the ass or of the goat, the former of which it is\r\ndifficult to procure, and the latter having a disagreeable odour. For a\r\nchild under three months of age, cow's milk should be used as the only\r\nfood. It should be fresh, and if possible from one cow. When of the\r\nordinary richness, it is to be diluted with an equal quantity of water\r\nor thin barley-water. If, however, the first milking can be obtained,\r\nwhich is more watery, and bears a closer resemblance in its chemical\r\ncomposition to human milk, but little dilution will be required. If\r\ngreen and acrid stools make their appearance, accompanied by emaciation\r\nand vomiting, the milk must be more diluted, and given less frequently.\r\nIf the symptoms of indigestion do not yield, milk containing an excess\r\nof cream should be used. To procure it, allow fresh milk to stand for\r\ntwo or three hours, and remove the upper third, to which add two or\r\nthree parts of warm water or barley-water, after having dissolved in it\r\na little sugar of milk. Should this food also disagree, any of the\r\npreparations we are about to mention may be prepared and tried.\r\n\r\nProfessor Falkland recommends the following method of preparing milk for\r\ninfants, as affording a product more nearly like the natural\r\nsecretion:--'One third of a pint of pure milk is allowed to stand until\r\nthe cream has risen. The latter is removed, and to the blue milk thus\r\nobtained about a square inch of rennet is to be added, and the\r\nmilk-vessel placed in warm water. In about five minutes the curd will\r\nhave separated, and the rennet, which may again be repeatedly used,\r\nbeing removed, the whey is carefully poured off, and immediately heated\r\nto boiling, to prevent it becoming sour. A further quantity of curd\r\nseparates, and must be removed by straining through calico. In\r\none-quarter of a pint of this hot whey three-eighths of an ounce of milk\r\nsugar are to be dissolved; and this solution, along with the cream\r\nremoved from the one-third of a pint of milk, must be added to half a\r\npint of new milk. This will constitute the food for an infant from five\r\nto eight months old for twelve hours; or, more correctly speaking, it\r\nwill be one-half of the quantity required for twenty-four hours. It is\r\nabsolutely necessary that a fresh quantity should be prepared every\r\ntwelve hours; and it is scarcely necessary to add, that the strictest\r\ncleanliness in all the vessels used is indispensable.'\r\n\r\nDr. J. Forsyth Meigs directs the following article of diet as one which\r\nhe has found to agree better with the digestive system of the infant\r\nthan any other kind of food:--'A scruple of gelatine (or a piece two\r\ninches square of the flat cake in which it is sold) is soaked for a\r\nshort time in cold water, and then boiled in half a pint of water, until\r\nit dissolves--about ten or fifteen minutes. To this is added, with\r\nconstant stirring, and just at the termination of the boiling, the milk\r\nand arrowroot, the latter being previously mixed into a paste with a\r\nlittle cold water. After the addition of the milk and arrowroot, and\r\njust before the removal from the fire, the cream is poured in, and a\r\nmoderate quantity of loaf sugar added. The proportions of milk, cream,\r\nand arrowroot must depend on the age and digestive powers of the child.\r\nFor a healthy infant, within the month, I usually direct from three to\r\nfour ounces of milk, half an ounce to an ounce of cream, and a\r\ntea-spoonful of arrowroot to half a pint of water. For older children,\r\nthe quantity of milk and cream should be gradually increased to a half\r\nor two-thirds milk, and from one to two ounces of cream. I seldom\r\nincrease the quantity of gelatine or arrowroot.'\r\n\r\nThe egg is a valuable article of food for infants and young children,\r\nespecially in conditions of debility. It should be given nearly raw, and\r\nis best prepared by placing it in boiling water for two minutes. It is\r\nthen easily digested.\r\n\r\nBeef-tea, prepared in the manner described on page 234, is highly\r\nnutritious and useful as a food for infants: if it produce a laxative\r\neffect, it should be discontinued. When the child shows signs of\r\nweakness or of a scrofulous condition its nutrition will be improved by\r\nmingling with its food a small piece of butter or mutton suet.\r\n\r\nDuring the first four or five months the food should be thin, and taken\r\nthrough a teat, thus preventing the stuffing of the infant.\r\n\r\nOn attaining the age of twelve or fifteen months, infants are usually\r\nable to digest ordinary wholesome solid food, neatly and well cooked,\r\nwhen mashed or cut into fine pieces.\r\n\r\nAn article of food employed for the diarrhoea of infants is prepared as\r\nfollows:--'A pound of dry wheat flour of the best quality is packed\r\nsnugly in a bag and boiled three or four hours. When it is taken from\r\nthe bag it is hard, resembling a piece of chalk, with the exception of\r\nthe exterior, which is wet, and should be removed. The flour grated from\r\nthe mass should be used the same as arrowroot or rice.'\r\n\r\nInfants nourished by prepared food thrive well enough during cool\r\nweather, but during the warm months of the year they are exceedingly\r\nliable to bowel complaint, of which large numbers of the spoon-fed\r\ninfants of cities die each summer season. Hence the importance of taking\r\nthem into the country; and keeping them there until the return of cool\r\nweather lessens the danger of city life.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEANING.\r\n\r\nThis should take place when the child is about twelve months of\r\nage--sometimes a few months earlier, often a few later. If the mother's\r\nhealth be good, and her milk abundant, it may be deferred until the\r\ncanine teeth appear--between the fifteenth and twentieth month. The\r\nchild will then have sixteen teeth with which it can properly masticate\r\nsoft solid food.\r\n\r\n_Time of the year for._--The infant should not be taken from the breast\r\nduring or immediately preceding warm weather. If the mother, either on\r\naccount of sickness or failure in her breast-milk, is obliged during the\r\nsummer to give up nursing, she should at once procure a wet-nurse. If\r\nshe cannot, the child must be sent into the country. To wean an infant\r\nin the city in hot weather, is to expose it to almost certain death.\r\n\r\n_Proper method._--The process of weaning should be a very slow one. No\r\ndefinite day should be fixed for it. Little by little, from week to\r\nweek, the amount of spoon-food is to be increased and the nursing\r\nlessened--being first given up at night. The breast should never be\r\nsuddenly denied to a child unaccustomed to artificial food, but be\r\ndisplaced by degrees, by the bottle and the spoon. This gradual change\r\nwill neither fret the child nor annoy the mother, as sudden weaning\r\nalways does.\r\n\r\nThe infant may begin to be accustomed to artificial food at the age of\r\nfour months. At first, only diluted cow's milk should be given it\r\noccasionally between the times of nursing. In a tumbler one-third full\r\nof water dissolve a tea-spoonful of sugar of milk; add to the sweetened\r\nwater an equal quantity of fresh cow's milk; then, if the child's stools\r\nare at all green, mix with this two tea-spoonfuls of lime water. Instead\r\nof pure water, barley-water made in the usual way, and boiled to the\r\nconsistency of milk, may be employed in this preparation--being added,\r\nwhile still warm, to an equal amount of milk. Or, toast-water may be\r\nsubstituted as a diluter of the milk. Cow's milk should not be boiled,\r\nif it can be preserved in any other way. As the infant advances in\r\nmonths, some solid food may be allowed. After six months, pap, made with\r\nstale bread and tops and bottoms, is proper once or twice a day.\r\nBeef-tea, made according to the recipe we have given, and chicken, lamb,\r\nor mutton broth, may now also be occasionally taken. As the quantity of\r\nmilk diminishes towards the close of the first year, the spoon-food\r\nshould be resorted to more frequently to supply the want. Solid food\r\nought not to be given before the child is a year old.\r\n\r\nThe breasts usually cause little trouble when the weaning is performed\r\nin the gradual manner which has been recommended. The mother should\r\nduring this time drink as little as possible, refrain from stimulating\r\nfood, and take occasionally a little cream of tartar, citrate of\r\nmagnesia, or a seidlitz powder. If the breasts continue to fill with\r\nmilk, _they should not be drawn_. The 'drying up of the milk' may be\r\nfacilitated by gently rubbing the breasts several times a day with\r\ncamphorated oil, made by dissolving over the fire, in a saucer of sweet\r\noil, as much camphor as it will take up. Tea made from the marshmallow\r\nhas also been recommended for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEETHING.\r\n\r\nThe period at which the teeth first make their appearance is not a fixed\r\none. It varies considerably even within the limits of perfect health.\r\nIt may be said, as a rule, that the babe begins to cut its teeth at the\r\nage of six or seven months. Quite frequently, however, the first teeth\r\nappear as early as the fourth month, or are delayed until the eighth. In\r\nsome instances children come into the world with their teeth already\r\ncut. This is said to have been the case with Louis XIV. and with\r\nMirabeau. King Richard the Third is another example. Shakspeare makes\r\nthe Duke of York refer to this circumstance in these words:\r\n\r\n    'Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast,\r\n      That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old:\r\n      'Twas two full years ere I could get a tooth.'\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that children whose teeth show themselves early, will\r\nhave, therefore, a quicker general development. Such cases are merely\r\ninstances of irregularity in the time of dentition, and carry with them\r\nno particular significance. Irregularities in regard to the order in\r\nwhich the teeth are cut are also of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, it cannot be maintained that all healthy children cut\r\ntheir teeth in a certain regular order and time, yet it is certain that\r\nthose children who follow the general rule which prevails in this\r\nrespect, suffer least from the difficulties and effects of dentition. As\r\nall mothers desire to know at what time they may expect the teeth, we\r\nwill state the rule of their development in the great majority of cases.\r\n\r\nThe lower teeth generally precede those of the upper jaw by two to three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe twenty milk-teeth usually appear in the five following groups:--\r\n\r\n_First_, Between the fourth and eighth months of life the two lower\r\nfront middle teeth appear almost simultaneously; then a pause of from\r\nthree to nine weeks ensues.\r\n\r\n_Second_, Between the eighth and tenth months of life the five upper\r\nfront teeth appear, following shortly upon each other, the two central\r\npreceding the two on each side of them. Another pause of from six to\r\ntwelve weeks succeeds.\r\n\r\n_Third_, Between the twelfth and sixteenth months of life six teeth\r\nappear nearly at once. They are first the two front grinding teeth in\r\nthe upper jaw, leaving a space between them and the front teeth which\r\nbefore appeared; next the two lower front teeth, situated one on each\r\nside of the central ones, which were the first to appear; and, lastly,\r\nthe two front grinders of the lower jaw. A pause until the eighteenth\r\nmonth now ensues.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_, Between the eighteenth and twenty-fourth months of life the\r\ncanine teeth cut through (the upper ones are called eye-teeth). Again a\r\npause until the thirtieth month.\r\n\r\n_Fifth_, Between the thirtieth and thirty-sixth months the second four\r\ngrinders finally make their appearance.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the first teething. The child has now twenty milk-teeth.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned that children are sometimes born with teeth. It is\r\nalso true that sometimes they never acquire any. Instances are on record\r\nof adults who have never cut any teeth. Dentition has been known to\r\ntake place very late in life. A case is related, on excellent authority,\r\nof an old lady aged eighty-five, who cut several teeth after attaining\r\nthat age.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEARANCE OF THE PERMANENT TEETH.\r\n\r\nBetween the fifth and sixth years of life the second dentition begins.\r\nThe front grinders are the ones first cut through. Between the sixth and\r\ntenth years all the front teeth appear, followed by the canines before\r\nthe twelfth year. At this time the second grinders show themselves; and\r\nfinally, between the sixteenth and twenty-fourth year, the wisdom-teeth\r\ncomplete the dental furniture of the mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nVACCINATION.\r\n\r\nThis operation, to which every infant should be subjected, is one of\r\ngreat practical importance. The attempt has been made of late to shake\r\nthe public faith in its efficacy, and to revive the old fabulous stories\r\nand foolish notions as to the production of serious affections of the\r\nblood and skin in this manner. At the same time, the increasing\r\nfrequency and virulence of small-pox are becoming only too evident. We\r\ntherefore consider it our duty, in treating of the maternal management\r\nof infancy, to lay some stress upon the necessity for vaccination as a\r\npreservative of life and health. If observation and experience ever\r\ntaught anything, they have taught the protective power of this operation\r\nagainst the most loathsome and one of the most fatal diseases that ever\r\nafflicted the human race. And that mother who is careless and\r\nindifferent in this matter neglects for her children a means of\r\npreventing disfigurement and saving life, compared with which all other\r\nmeans are scarcely worthy of mention.\r\n\r\nIn order to appreciate the value of vaccination, it is only necessary to\r\nconsider what small-pox was before its discovery,--to look at that\r\ndisease through the eyes of our fathers and grandfathers. Until the\r\nclose of the last century it was the most terrible of all the ministers\r\nof death. It filled the churchyards with corpses. When Jenner published\r\nhis great discovery, about seventy years ago, the annual death-rate from\r\nsmall-pox in England was estimated at three thousand in the million of\r\npopulation. In other countries of Europe the rate reached as high as\r\nfour thousand in the million. And these fatal cases must be multiplied\r\nby five or six, to give the entire number of persons annually attacked\r\nby the disease. It spared neither high nor low. Macaulay informs us that\r\nQueen Mary, the wife of William III., fell a victim to it. Those in whom\r\nthe disease did not prove fatal, carried about with them the hideous\r\ntraces of its malignity; for it 'turned the babe into a changeling at\r\nwhich the mother shuddered,' and made 'the eyes and cheeks of the\r\nbetrothed maiden objects of horror to the lover.' Few escaped being\r\nattacked by this fell disease. Nearly one-tenth of all the persons who\r\ndied in London during the last century died of this one cause. Children\r\nwere peculiarly its victims. In some of the great cities of England more\r\nthan one-third of all the deaths among children under ten years of age\r\narose from small-pox. Two-thirds of all the applicants for relief at\r\nthe Hospital for the Indigent Blind had lost their sight by small-pox.\r\nThe number of hopeless deafened ears, crippled joints, and broken-down\r\nconstitutions from the same cause cannot be accurately computed, but was\r\ncertainly very large. Vaccination is all that now stands between us and\r\nall these horrors of the last century.\r\n\r\nIs the strength of this barrier doubted?--Its efficacy is readily\r\nproved. In England, during the twelve years (1854-1865) in which\r\nvaccination has been to a certain extent compulsory, the average annual\r\nrate of deaths by small-pox has been two hundred and two in the million\r\nof population. Contrast this with the annual death-rate of three\r\nthousand to the million, which was the average of thirty years previous\r\nto the introduction of vaccination. Mr. John Simon, medical officer of\r\nHer Majesty's Privy Council, one of the best statisticians in England,\r\nhas collected a formidable array of figures, 'to doubt which would be to\r\nfly in the face of the multiplication-table.' From his mountain-height\r\nof statistics Mr. Simon says: 'Wheresoever vaccination falls into\r\nneglect, small-pox tends to become again the same frightful pestilence\r\nit was in the days before Jenner's discovery; and wherever it is\r\nuniversally and properly performed, small-pox tends to be of as little\r\neffect as any extinct epidemic of the Middle Ages.'\r\n\r\nAre other diseases ever produced by vaccination?--The popular belief\r\nwould answer this question in the affirmative. All affections of the\r\nskin and swelling's of the glands noticed in children soon after\r\nvaccination, are attributed by parents in many cases to this operation.\r\nThey forget that such diseases are met with constantly in infancy and\r\nchildhood, as often among the unvaccinated as the vaccinated.\r\nObservation does not show that they occur with greater frequency among\r\nthe vaccinated. An English physician has been at the trouble to examine\r\nand record a thousand cases of skin disease in children: he found no\r\nevidence whatever that vaccination disposes the constitution to such\r\naffections. It has been stated with apparent justness, that parental\r\ncomplaints of this kind frequently arise from their unwillingness to\r\nbelieve there is anything wrong in their offspring. Hence, when other\r\ndiseases follow, vaccination gets blamed for what is really and truly\r\ndue to other causes. So far from doing any harm to the system, it has\r\nbeen observed in those countries where vaccination has been most\r\nthoroughly practised, that, leaving small-pox out of the question, there\r\nhave been fewer deaths from other maladies. This is especially true of\r\ntwo of the most important classes of diseases, namely, scrofulous\r\naffections and low fever. For this reason, some medical statisticians\r\nhave attributed to vaccination an indirect protective influence against\r\nthese disorders.\r\n\r\nAt what _age_ should the child be vaccinated?--If the health permit, the\r\noperation should always be performed in very early infancy. The chief\r\nsufferers from small-pox are young children. One-fourth of all who die\r\nfrom this fatal disease in England are children under the age of one\r\nyear. In Scotland, where until recently vaccination has been much more\r\nneglected than in England, the proportion even amounted to nearly\r\none-third; and of these, one-fourth were under the age of three months.\r\nThe great risk, particularly in large towns, where small-pox is seldom\r\nabsent, of delaying vaccination is obvious. City children, if hearty,\r\nshould be vaccinated when a month or six weeks old. Rarely or never\r\nought it to be delayed beyond two or three months. This early period of\r\nlife is also particularly suitable to vaccination, because the\r\naccompanying fever will then be over before the disturbing influence of\r\nteething begins.\r\n\r\n\r\nRE-VACCINATION.\r\n\r\nIf the first vaccination be found imperfect in character, that is, if it\r\nhas not properly 'taken,' the operation should be repeated at the\r\nearliest opportunity. It has been recommended, in all cases, to perform\r\na second vaccination not later than the sixth or eighth year. If\r\nsmall-pox be prevailing, it is proper to vaccinate all who have not been\r\nvaccinated within three or four years. In any event, re-vaccination at\r\nor after the period of puberty is of extreme importance. It will give\r\nadditional security even to those whose original vaccination was\r\nperfect. In some cases, the susceptibility to small-pox is not wholly\r\nexhausted by one vaccination. Inasmuch as it is desirable for every one\r\nto escape this disease, even in its most modified form, re-vaccination\r\nshould always be performed, as it affords a very sure and trustworthy\r\nmeans of such escape. After successful re-vaccination, small-pox, even\r\nin its mildest shape, is rarely met with. In girls especially, in whom\r\nthe changes which occur at puberty are most marked, re-vaccination\r\nshould be performed about the age of fourteen.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\nDuring infancy the body grows with great rapidity. About the end of the\r\nthird year one-half of the adult height of the body is attained. After\r\nthis period growth is more gradual; for in order to reach the remaining\r\nhalf, about eighteen years more are required. At twenty years of age the\r\nheight is somewhat more than three and a half times that at birth, and\r\nthe weight about twenty times. Development does not go on at an equal\r\nrate in all parts of the body. The lower limbs, small at birth, increase\r\nproportionally more rapidly, while the head, relatively large at birth,\r\ndevelopes more slowly. The muscular system is gradually strengthened. At\r\nthe end of the third month the infant is able, if in good health,\r\nreadily to support its head; at the fourth month it can be held upright;\r\nat the ninth month it crawls about the floor; by the end of the year it\r\nis able with assistance to step; and between one and two years, at\r\ndifferent times, according to its vigor and activity, it acquires the\r\npower of standing and walking alone. The periods of greatest and least\r\ngrowth of the child are, on the one hand, spring and summer; on the\r\nother, autumn and winter. It has long been known that animals grow more\r\nrapidly in the spring than at any other season of the year. This has\r\nbeen attributed to the abundance of herbage they are then able to\r\nobtain. It has been ascertained by actual measurement, that children\r\ngrow chiefly in the spring.\r\n\r\nAt six months of age the child begins to lisp, and at twelve months it\r\nis usually able to utter distinct and intelligible sounds of one or two\r\nsyllables. The development of the senses and of the mind proceeds\r\ngradually. The sense of hearing is more active and further advanced than\r\nthat of sight. Sounds are appreciated sooner than light or bright\r\ncolored objects. The next sense which is developed is perhaps that of\r\ntaste; then follow smell and touch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOOD OF INFANTS AND CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nThe diet of children is frequently improper either in regard to\r\nquantity, quality, or variety. In 1867, a committee, of which Professor\r\nAustin Flint, Jr., was chairman, was appointed in New York city to\r\nrevise the 'Dietary Table of the Children's Nurseries on Randall's\r\nIsland.' In the report rendered, attention was forcibly called to the\r\nfact that in childhood 'the demands of the system for nourishment are in\r\nexcess of the waste, the extra quantity being required for growth and\r\ndevelopment. If the proper quantity and variety of food be not provided,\r\nfull development cannot take place, and the children grow up, if they\r\nsurvive, into young men and women, incapable of the ordinary amount of\r\nlabor, and liable to diseases of various kinds. This is frequently\r\nillustrated in the higher walks of life, particularly in females; for\r\nmany suffer through life from improper diet in boarding schools, due to\r\nfalse and artificial notions of delicacy or refinement. After a certain\r\nperiod of improper and deficient diet in children, the appetite becomes\r\npermanently impaired, and the system is rendered incapable of\r\nappropriating the amount of matter necessary to proper development and\r\ngrowth.'\r\n\r\nCharlotte Bronté has drawn, in _Jane Eyre_, a graphic and\r\nphysiologically true picture of the effects upon young girls of\r\nlong-continued insufficiency of food. Let mothers bear in mind that\r\nproper food cannot be too abundantly eaten by children, and that the\r\ngreatest danger to which they are exposed arises from defective\r\nnutrition. We would again urge the value of a large amount of _milk_ in\r\nthe dietary of young people. The disorders of the bowels, which are not\r\nuncommon in infancy and childhood, are due to errors in diet by which\r\nimproper food is supplied, and not to an excess of simple and proper\r\nnourishment.\r\n\r\nWe have already given some directions for the preparation of infants'\r\nfood in treating of 'bringing-up by hand.' In addition to the various\r\nsubstitutes for the mother's milk there mentioned, we wish to note that\r\nknown as _Liebig's soup_. This great chemist thus describes the method\r\nof making it:\r\n\r\n'Half an ounce of wheat flour, half an ounce of malt meal, and seven and\r\na half grains of bicarbonate of potass, are weighed off. They are first\r\nmixed by themselves, then with the addition of one ounce of water, and\r\nlastly, of five ounces of milk. This mixture is then heated upon a slow\r\nfire, being constantly stirred until it begins to get thick. At this\r\nperiod the vessel is removed from the fire, and the mixture is stirred\r\nfor five minutes, is again heated and again removed when it gets thick,\r\nand, lastly, it is heated till it boils. This soup is purified from bran\r\nby passing it through a fine sieve (a piece of fine muslin), and now it\r\nis ready for use.'\r\n\r\nBarley-malt can be obtained at any brewery. First, it is separated from\r\nthe impurities, and then ground in an ordinary coffee-mill to a coarse\r\nmeal. Care should be taken to get the common fresh wheat-flour, _not the\r\nfinest_, because the former is richest in starch.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the troublesome weighing of the materials may be dispensed\r\nwith, as a heaped table-spoonful of wheat-flour weighs pretty nearly\r\nhalf an ounce, and a like table-spoonful of malt-meal, not quite as\r\nheaped, weighs also half an ounce. The bicarbonate of potass can be\r\nobtained from the druggist put up in powders of seven and a half grains,\r\neach ready for use. The amount of water and of milk prescribed can be\r\nattained with sufficient accuracy by means of the table-spoon; two\r\ntable-spoonfuls will give the quantity of water (one ounce), and ten\r\ntable-spoonfuls the quantity of milk (five ounces). These directions\r\nwill enable any sensible mother to make the preparation without\r\ndifficulty. The soup tastes tolerably sweet, and, when diluted with\r\nwater, may be given to very young infants.\r\n\r\nAlthough the method of preparing Liebig's soup is a somewhat tedious\r\none, yet, as it is a combination which has long been so highly\r\nrecommended by physicians of the largest experience for having visibly\r\nsaved the lives of many wasting children, it deserves a trial in all\r\ncases in which the ordinary kinds of food disagree.\r\n\r\nOn page 276 are recorded the directions given by Dr. J. Forsyth Meigs\r\nfor an article of diet, consisting of gelatine and arrowroot, which he\r\nprefers to all other kinds of artificial infant food. Another method of\r\npreparing a useful arrowroot mixture is as follows:--\r\n\r\nPlace a tea-spoonful of arrowroot in a porcelain vessel, with as much\r\ncold water as will make it into a fine dough; then add a cupful of\r\nboiling milk or of beef-tea; stir the mixture a little, and allow it to\r\nboil for a few minutes until the whole acquires the consistency of a\r\nfine light jelly.\r\n\r\nThe _manner_ in which nutriment is administered to infants is not\r\nimmaterial. The custom of feeding them from a small spoon, or from a cup\r\nwith a snout, is objectionable. The use of a sucking-bottle most nearly\r\nimitates the way in which nature designed the nursling to obtain its\r\nnourishment. By the act of sucking, the muscles of the face are\r\nexercised in an equal manner, and the saliva is mixed with the food to\r\nan extent which is not possible if any other mode of feeding be resorted\r\nto. Children drink very readily out of the perforated rubber nipples,\r\nwhich are now so popular for this purpose: they are made to fit over the\r\nmouth of the bottle, and are especially to be recommended on account of\r\ntheir cleanliness. The bottle should never be refilled until both it and\r\nthe rubber cap have been thoroughly cleansed in warm water. A white\r\nglass bottle only should be employed in order that any want of\r\ncleanliness may readily be detected. It should be recollected that milk\r\nvery quickly sours when kept in this way in a warm room; it is therefore\r\nbetter always to empty the bottle and fill it afresh each time it is\r\ngiven to the child, rather than to wait until its contents are exhausted\r\nbefore replenishing it.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto been treating mainly of the diet proper for the first\r\nyear of life. In the second year children may be permitted to have soft,\r\nfinely-cut meat. Fresh ripe fruit in season ordinarily agrees\r\nexcellently well. But boiled green vegetables and husk fruits are very\r\napt to cause indigestion and diarrhoea. Fruit for children should be\r\nfreed from the stones and skins; which latter are indigestible, and\r\noften do harm.\r\n\r\nAs an example of a diet suitable for a child two years of age we append\r\nthe following:--In the mornings, between six and seven o'clock in\r\nsummer, or between seven and eight in winter, milk-gruel; between nine\r\nand ten o'clock, a piece of wheat bread with a little butter on it; at\r\ntwelve o'clock, well-prepared beef-tea, or chicken, lamb, mutton broth,\r\nor meat with a little gravy; or in place of the meat, a meal-broth\r\nprepared with eggs, but with very little fat; green vegetables to be\r\nallowed very rarely, and in very small quantities. At this noon meal a\r\nmealy well-mashed potato is unobjectionable; so also is rice pudding for\r\na change. In the afternoon, between three and four, bread and milk, with\r\nthe addition in summer of fresh ripe fruit; in the evening, at seven,\r\nbread and milk.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this dietetic table calls for five meals a day.\r\nShould the child eat so frequently? We answer yes. But the meals should\r\nbe at regular intervals. A child, in order to replace the waste of the\r\nsystem, and to furnish over and above sufficient material to build up\r\nthe growing body, requires a much larger proportionate amount of food\r\nthan an adult. It also requires its food at shorter intervals. By\r\nobserving the hours for meals stated above, _regularity_, which is of so\r\nmuch importance to the health of the digestive organs, will be secured.\r\nIf a young child be allowed only the three ordinary meals of the family,\r\nit will crave for something between times, and too often have its\r\ncraving met with a piece of cake or other improper food. Its appetite\r\nfor dinner or supper will in this manner be destroyed, and the stomach\r\nand the general health suffer.\r\n\r\nAfter the third or fourth year children are able to eat all kinds of\r\nvegetables. They may then very appropriately be allowed to eat at the\r\ntable with the family. It is only necessary to refuse them very salt,\r\nsour, and highly-spiced victuals. Of all others they may partake in\r\nmoderation. Neither wine nor any malt liquor should be given them. Tea\r\nand coffee are also, to say the least, unnecessary. They should have a\r\nregular luncheon between the meals which are furthest apart. This must\r\nbe at a regular hour, and consist of bread and butter, with milk or\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nPains should be taken to see that children do not fall into the habit\r\nof eating rapidly. Too often this pernicious habit, so destructive to\r\nhealthy digestion, is formed in early life, and becomes the source of\r\nthat dyspepsia which is the bane of so many lives. Food that is gulped\r\ndown enters the stomach unmasticated, and unmixed with the secretions of\r\nthe mouth. A dog may bolt his food without injury, but a human being\r\ncannot.\r\n\r\nA child should be taught to eat everything that is wholesome, and not be\r\npermitted to become finical or fastidious in its appetite. It ought not,\r\nhowever, to be forced to eat any particular article for which it is\r\nfound that there is an invincible dislike. Variety of diet is good for a\r\nchild, after the second or third year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POSITION OF THE CHILD WHEN FED.\r\n\r\nAn infant, no matter how young, should not receive its meals when lying.\r\nIts head should always be raised in the nurse's arm, if it be too young\r\nto support it itself. The practice of _jolting_ and _dandling_ the\r\ninfant after eating is a wrong one. Rest of the body should be secured\r\nby placing the child on a bed, or holding it on the mother's knee, for a\r\nhalf hour or so. Observe the inclination which all animals show for\r\nrepose and sleep after a full repast, and respect the same inclination\r\nin the infant.\r\n\r\nIn our remarks upon bathing we pointed out the importance of the mother\r\nherself performing for her child this office. So again, in connection\r\nwith children's food, we must notice the necessity of the mother being\r\nalways present at their meals, in order that they may be taught to take\r\nthem quietly, with cleanliness and without hurry. Such advice is not\r\nneeded by the poor nor by women of moderate fortune, who ordinarily have\r\ntheir children constantly under their eyes. But affluence brings with it\r\nmany occupations which are frequently deemed of more moment than\r\npresiding over a child's dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCERNING SLEEP IN EARLY LIFE.\r\n\r\nThere is a natural desire for much sleep during infancy, childhood, and\r\nyouth; and there is reason for its free indulgence. Infants pass the\r\ngreater portion of both day and night in sleep. Children up to the age\r\nof six years require, as a rule, twelve hours of repose at night,\r\nbesides an hour or more in the middle of the day. About the sixth year\r\nthe noon nap may be discontinued, but the night sleep ought not to be\r\nabridged before the tenth year, and then only to a moderate extent until\r\nthe age of puberty. From this time the period of slumber may be\r\ngradually reduced to nine or ten hours. No further diminution should be\r\nattempted until the completion of growth, when another hour or two may\r\nbe taken away, leaving about eight hours of daily sleep as the proper\r\namount during middle life.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong, therefore, to wake a young child in the morning. It should\r\nbe allowed to sleep as long as it will, which will be until the wants of\r\nthe system are satisfied, if it be not aroused by noise or light.\r\n\r\nWhen after a few months the infant is awake a considerable portion of\r\nthe day, it should be brought into the habit of taking its second sleep\r\nnear the middle of the day, say from eleven to one o'clock, and again,\r\nfrom half an hour to an hour, about three o'clock. It should not be\r\npermitted a nap later than this in the afternoon, as it would be very\r\napt to cause a disturbed night. Although some physicians recommend that\r\nthe sleep during the day be discontinued after the infant has attained\r\nthe age of fifteen months, the wisdom of such advice may well be\r\ndoubted. As soon as the child begins to walk, not only are its movements\r\nvery constant and active, but its mind is busily employed and its\r\nnervous system excited. It therefore thrives better if its day be\r\ndivided into two by sleep for an hour or two.\r\n\r\n_Should the infant sleep alone?_--We have mentioned the danger of being\r\noverlain to which it is exposed when in bed with its mother or nurse. On\r\nthe other hand, it must be remembered that an infant keeps warm with\r\ndifficulty even when well covered, and that contact with the mother's\r\nbody is the best way of securing its own warmth. Hence, during the first\r\nmonths the child had better be allowed to sleep with its mother. How,\r\nthen, can the risk of being suffocated, which is no imaginary one, be\r\nlessened? The following rules are those given by a physician of\r\nreputation, to prevent an infant from being accidentally overlain.\r\n\r\n'Let the baby while asleep have plenty of room in the bed. Do not allow\r\nhim to be too near, or, if this be unavoidable from the small size of\r\nthe bed, let his face be turned to the opposite side. Let him lie\r\nfairly, either on his side or on his back. Be careful to ascertain that\r\nhis mouth be not covered with the bed-clothes. Do not smother his face\r\nwith clothes, as a plentiful supply of pure air is as necessary as when\r\nhe is awake. Never let him lie low in the bed. Let there be no pillow\r\nnear the one his head is resting on, lest he roll to it and bury his\r\nhead in it. Remember a young child has neither the strength nor the\r\nsense to get out of danger; and if he unfortunately either turn on his\r\nface or bury his head in a pillow that is near, the chances are that he\r\nwill be suffocated, more especially as these accidents usually occur at\r\nnight, when the mother or the nurse is fast asleep. Never entrust him at\r\nnight to a young, giddy, and thoughtless servant. A foolish mother\r\nsometimes goes to sleep while allowing her child to continue sucking.\r\nThe unconscious babe, after a time, loses the nipple, and buries his\r\nhead in the bed-clothes. She awakes in the morning, finding, to her\r\nhorror, a corpse by her side! A mother ought therefore never to go to\r\nsleep until her child has ceased sucking.'\r\n\r\nWhen a couple of months have elapsed, the child, if a healthy one, may\r\nsleep alone. What the child sleeps in is not a matter of great moment,\r\nprovided it has a sufficiency of clothing, and be not exposed to\r\ncurrents of air. A large clothes-basket will serve all the purposes of a\r\ncrib. The mistake is often made of burying the child under too heavy a\r\nmass of bed-clothes in a warm room when asleep. And this inconsistency\r\nis committed by the very mothers who scantily clad the child during the\r\nday in order to inure it to the cold. The great transition from its\r\nwrappings by night to those by day is injurious to the health and\r\ncomfort of the infant.\r\n\r\n'In arranging night coverings, the soft feather-bed is very often\r\nestimated as nothing; or, in other words, the same provision of blankets\r\nis considered indispensable, whether we lie upon a hard mattress or\r\nimmersed in down. The mother, looking only to the covering laid over the\r\nchild, forgets those on which it lies, although in reality the latter\r\nmay be the warmer of the two. An infant deposited in a downy bed has at\r\nleast two-thirds of its body in contact with the feathers, and may thus\r\nbe perspiring at every pore, when, from its having only a single\r\ncovering thrown over it, the mother may imagine it to be enjoying the\r\nrestorative influence of agreeable slumber. In hot weather much mischief\r\nmight be done by an oversight of this kind.'\r\n\r\nIt is of course essential to the health and comfort of the infant that\r\nits bed and bed-clothing be kept perfectly dry and sweet. They should\r\nfrequently be taken out and exposed to the air.\r\n\r\nA child should be accustomed early to sleep in a darkened room. Plutarch\r\npraises the women of Sparta for, among other things, teaching their\r\nchildren not to be afraid in the dark. He says they 'were so careful and\r\nexpert, that without swaddling-bands their children were all straight\r\nand well proportioned; and they brought them up not to be afraid in the\r\ndark or of being alone, and never indulged them in crying, fretfulness,\r\nand ill-humour; upon which account Spartan nurses were often bought by\r\npeople of other countries.'\r\n\r\n_Position in sleeping._--It has long been a popular opinion that the\r\nposition of our bodies at night, with reference to the cardinal points\r\nof the compass, has some influence on the health. This belief has\r\nrecently been corroborated by some observations made by a prominent\r\nphysician, Dr. Henry Kennedy. In an essay on the 'Acute Affections of\r\nChildren,' published in the Dublin _Quarterly Journal of Medical\r\nScience_, he states that for several years he has put in force in his\r\npractice a plan of treatment by means of the position of the patient,\r\nand often with very marked results. He asserts that, in order to ensure\r\nthe soundest sleep, the head should lie to the north. Strange as this\r\nidea may at first sight appear, it has more in it than might be\r\nsupposed. There are known to be great electrical currents always\r\ncoursing in one direction around the globe. In the opinion of Dr.\r\nKennedy there is no doubt that our nervous systems are in some\r\nmysterious way connected with this universal agent, as it may be called,\r\nelectricity. He relates several cases of acute diseases in children, in\r\nwhich, by altering the position of the body so that the patient should\r\nlie from north to south instead of from east to west, quiet sleep was\r\ninduced. This plan of invoking sleep is often successful; but not always\r\nso, for all are not equally susceptible. It applies likewise to adults.\r\nIt is not so striking in its effects on the poorer as on the richer\r\nclasses of society. This is what might be expected, for it cannot be\r\ndoubted that the nervous system in the middle and upper ranks is always\r\nin a much more sensitive state than with their poorer brethren. It is\r\nworth noting, that even in healthy persons sleep will often be absent or\r\nof a broken kind, from the cause of which we are now speaking. It is\r\nvery common to hear people saying they can never sleep in a strange bed.\r\nAlthough many causes may conspire to this, Dr. Kennedy cannot doubt that\r\namongst these ought to be placed the one to which we are now drawing\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLOTHING OF INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nA fertile cause of disease and death is to be found in the negligence or\r\nignorance displayed in regard to the dress of children. And it is not\r\nthe poorly attired, but nearly always the fashionably robed child, which\r\nsuffers the most. To parental vanity can be traced many a catarrh on the\r\nchest or the inflammation of the bowels which has resulted in death.\r\nMost mothers appear to be ignorant of the fact that children are\r\nexceedingly susceptible to the influence of cold. The returns of the\r\nRegistrar-General of England show that a very cold week always greatly\r\nincreases the mortality of the very young. While adults carefully\r\nprotect themselves against every change of the weather, and against\r\ncurrents of air, children, who most need such protection, are too often\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nThe warmth of the infant's body is best secured by that of the nurse,\r\nand by warm clothing. It is more effectually and healthfully provided\r\nfor in this manner than by confining the child to a warm atmosphere.\r\nYoung children should never be dressed _décolleté_--in low necks and\r\nshort sleeves. That fashion is a dangerous one which leaves the neck,\r\nshoulders, and arms uncovered. To this irrational custom may be traced a\r\nvast amount of the suffering and many of the deaths of early life;\r\ndoubtless, also, in many cases it lays the foundation of consumption,\r\nwhich manifests itself a little later. But, it is said, the child will\r\nbe 'hardened' by having its chest and limbs thus exposed. The surest and\r\nsafest way to harden the child is to so care for it that it shall pass\r\nthrough its first months and years of life without any ailment. Every\r\nmother should see to it, that her charge is so clothed that every part\r\nof the body is effectually protected from dampness and cold. She can\r\nthen best secure for it a hardened constitution by carrying it daily\r\ninto the sunlight of the open air.\r\n\r\n_The material_ of the clothing should be such as will unite lightness\r\nwith warmth. Flannel and calico are therefore to be preferred. At first,\r\nas the skin of the child is very delicate, a shirt of fine linen may be\r\ninterposed between it and the flannel. But, after the first few months,\r\nthe gentle friction of fine soft flannel next the skin is desirable, as\r\nit stimulates the circulation of the blood on the surface of the body,\r\nand promotes health. Flannel under-clothing should be continued all the\r\nyear, during the summer months a very light texture being used. When the\r\ndress of the child is shortened, care must be taken that the feet are\r\nwell covered with soft stockings of cotton or woollen (which in winter\r\nshould extend up above the knees), and with light leather shoes.\r\n\r\nThe _night-dress_, at least during cold weather, is best made of\r\nflannel, thin or thick according to the climate. It has been recommended\r\nthat, after the child is somewhat advanced, the night-clothes be\r\nconstructed in the form of night-pants, so that it may not be exposed if\r\nthe bed-clothing be thrown off. Every article of dress worn during the\r\nday ought to be removed at night.\r\n\r\nThe rule in regard to the _quantity of clothing_ is, that it should be\r\nin sufficient amount to preserve due warmth. It must therefore be\r\nregulated by the season of the year and the state of the weather. We\r\nhave mentioned the fatal practice of leaving bare at all seasons of the\r\nyear the upper part of the chest and arms of the little one, while the\r\nrest of the body is warmly clad. We can scarcely speak too emphatically\r\nnor too often of the danger to which the mother thus exposes that life,\r\nwhich it is her duty to wisely and safely conduct through the period of\r\ndependent infancy and childhood. It is of course possible for the child\r\nto be too closely enveloped, and the skin thus rendered highly\r\nsusceptible to the impressions of cold. The prevalent error, however, at\r\nthe present time, is in the direction of too scanty clothing.\r\n\r\n_The make of the dress_ should be loose and easy, so as to permit of the\r\nfree movement of all portions of the body; it should be cut high in the\r\nneck, and with sleeves to the wrists; its construction should be simple,\r\nso that it may be quickly put off and on; and the fastenings employed\r\nshould, as far as possible, be tapes, not pins. In the clothing of\r\nchildren the laws of hygiene, and not the code of fashion, should direct\r\nthe shape and style.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATHING OF INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nMany advantages attach to the daily use of the bath for infants. It\r\nsecures cleanliness, strengthens the nervous system, and preserves from\r\ncolds and coughs.\r\n\r\nWe have already endeavoured to impress upon the mind of the reader the\r\ngreat susceptibility to cold which exists in early life. On this account\r\nthe water for the bath should be warm (96° or 98°) for the first few\r\nweeks of infancy, especially during the winter season. Gradually the\r\ntemperature may be reduced to that of the apartment, never to actual\r\ncoldness. It is as foolish and hazardous to attempt to 'harden' infants\r\nby plunging them into cold water, as it is by carrying them with\r\nuncovered necks, chests, and limbs into the keen and damp air. Knowledge\r\nof these facts would bring safety to many children who now suffer,\r\nbecause of the dangerous ignorance of mothers in regard to the\r\nsusceptibility of the infant organisation.\r\n\r\nAn infant should be immersed in its tub every morning. Besides the\r\nregular morning bath, it is often advisable to put the child for a few\r\nminutes in tepid water in the evening. This will quiet the nervous\r\nsystem, and induce sleep. The bath should not be too long a one, for\r\nfear of exciting perspiration; nor, for the same reason, should the\r\nwater be too warm. If the child be of a delicate constitution, the\r\nevening bath will be especially useful, and can be made more so by the\r\naddition of two table-spoonfuls of salt to the water necessary for the\r\nbath.\r\n\r\nThe time immediately after nursing or feeding is not proper for bathing.\r\nAn hour or two after a meal should be allowed to elapse. Neither should\r\na bath ever be given in a cold room. Even in a warm atmosphere, care\r\nshould be taken, both after and during the ablution, that the wet skin\r\nof the infant be not exposed to the air. Its body should be completely\r\nimmersed; it should not be held up out of the water, nor, if it be old\r\nenough, allowed to stand or sit in the tub. It is well also to have a\r\nwarm blanket in which to receive the child as it comes dripping from the\r\nbath. It should be wrapped up in this for a few minutes, to absorb a\r\npart of the moisture. Then a portion of the body should be uncovered at\r\na time, and dried before exposing the rest.\r\n\r\n_Drying the skin._--For this purpose a piece of soft flannel will be\r\nfound serviceable. By gently rubbing the surface of the body with it the\r\nskin will be warmed and stimulated, and the resulting glow will be as\r\nagreeable to the child as is that in the adult which follows the Turkish\r\nbath. The actual grooming of the human body is very useful to improve\r\nthe health of scrofulous children.\r\n\r\nAt first from three to five minutes will be a sufficiently long\r\nimmersion. In a little while, however, this period may be lengthened,\r\nall the precautions mentioned against injurious exposure being observed.\r\n\r\nThe lukewarm daily bath, taken either in the morning or evening, ought\r\nto be continued until at least the age of four years. If, after the\r\nfourth or fifth year, ablutions of the entire body be resorted to only\r\nevery second or third day, the practice should be commenced of sponging\r\nthe chest every morning with cold, or alternately with cold and hot\r\nwater, followed by brisk frictions.\r\n\r\nSoap is to be used but sparingly in the bath of young children. It must\r\nbe of the blandest and purest quality. Various eruptions are caused by\r\nthe employment of impure soaps, and even by the excessive application of\r\nthe best kind.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the importance of our present subject, we may state\r\nthat Dr. Hufeland, to whose admirable work on the art of prolonging life\r\nwe have before alluded, lays down, as one of the means which lengthen\r\nlife, the care of the skin. He dwells upon the benefit of paying such\r\nattention to it from infancy that it may be kept in a lively, active,\r\nand useful condition.\r\n\r\nThe power of the bath to ward off disease in childhood is not\r\nsufficiently appreciated by parents. Properly managed, it soothes, but\r\nnever increases, any internal irritation which may exist, and often does\r\naway with the necessity of resorting to the administration of drugs. If\r\ndue attention were paid to the condition of the skin in early life, many\r\nof the most common ailments of childhood would be averted. The daily\r\nemployment of the bath, and scrupulous attention to cleanliness of the\r\nperson and clothing, would materially lessen the demand both for\r\npurgative medicines and for soothing syrups.\r\n\r\nOne word more in regard to the washing of the infant. The mother\r\nherself, if she be in health, should always perform this office, and not\r\nentrust it to the child's nurse. Plutarch awards high praise to Cato\r\nthe censor, for his invariable custom of being present when his child\r\nwas washed. Every mother, at least, would do well to follow the example\r\nof this old Roman. It will give her the opportunity to detect many\r\nincipient affections which would for a long while escape her attention\r\nif she saw the child only when dressed. The mother will also take pains\r\nto engage the mind of the little one, and render the bath a source of\r\namusement to it.\r\n\r\nAfter the fourth or fifth year, two or three baths a week during the\r\ncolder seasons of the year will be sufficient to keep the skin clean,\r\nand properly active. During the summer, however, a daily bath is of\r\ngreat advantage to children, and ought not to be neglected.\r\n\r\nSwimming is very useful and very invigorating to the health of both\r\nsexes. It is desirable that children be taught this art.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the _culture of the skin_ to the well-being of infancy\r\nand childhood cannot be brought too prominently to the notice of all\r\nmothers. We have therefore endeavoured to give some useful hints in\r\nregard both to the preservation of its cleanliness, and to the\r\nprevention, by means of garments and warming, of its exposure to too\r\ngreat changes of temperature.\r\n\r\nBy proper attention to the skin in the manner pointed out, many of the\r\neruptions with which children are afflicted might be prevented. The\r\nappearance of these the mother ought to regard as a great calamity, for\r\nthey are often difficult of cure, and render the child an object of\r\ndisgust. She ought also to look upon them as the mischievous\r\nconsequences of the neglect of those laws of health which it is her duty\r\nto learn and observe.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIR AND VENTILATION IN CHILDHOOD.\r\n\r\nFresh air is necessary for the robust development of infancy and\r\nchildhood. Infants born in the summer season should be carried out daily\r\nwhen the weather is pleasant, from the second or third day after birth.\r\nThose born in the winter should be kept in the house for two or three\r\nmonths before being introduced to the outer world on some sunny noonday.\r\nOlder children can scarcely pass too much time in the open air.\r\n\r\nA change in the dress must, of course, be made before exposing the child\r\nto the outdoor air. The head should be covered, and the chest and limbs\r\nwell protected from the cold.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, a child ought to be carried out, or permitted, when old\r\nenough, to walk out, at least once every pleasant day during the year.\r\nThe time of the day is to be varied with the season. In the winter, the\r\nmiddle of the day is to be chosen; in summer, the early portion of the\r\nforenoon, a few hours after sunrise.\r\n\r\nChildren show very quickly, even when in ill-health, the beneficial\r\nresults of a ride or walk. It quiets the irritability to which they are\r\nliable, more effectually than any other procedure. For a delicate child,\r\nor one recovering from sickness, fresh air and sunshine are the best\r\ntonics which can be administered. A fretful, peevish child will soon\r\nlearn to look forward to its daily jaunt on the street or road, and will\r\nbe quieted by it for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nAt all times of the year regard must be had to the state of the weather.\r\nThe infant ought never to be taken out on a wet day. Exposure to a damp\r\natmosphere is one of the most powerful causes of catarrh on the chest\r\nand inflammation of the lungs, to which young children are so subject. A\r\nvery high wind, even though the day be bright and dry, is injurious to a\r\nyoung infant, as it has been known to suspend its breathing for a time,\r\nwhich accident might, if not at once observed, bring about a fatal\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nBesides fresh air, _light_ is an indispensable requisite to the health\r\nof children. Nothing can compensate for the absence of its beneficial\r\neffects. It is to be remembered, however, that during the first week or\r\ntwo the eyes of the new-born babe are not strong enough to bear the full\r\nglare of light. The first eight days of its existence should be spent in\r\na half-darkened room. Gradually the apartment may be brightened, until\r\nfinally, after about two weeks, the young eyes become entirely\r\naccustomed to the light, and may be exposed to it without injury. A\r\nneglect of this precaution is one of the most common causes of the bad\r\ninflammation of the eyes so frequently met with among young infants.\r\nAfter the sight has become quite strong, a bright room will strengthen\r\nthe eyes, not weaken them; for light is the natural stimulant of the\r\neye, as exercise is of the muscles, or food of the stomach.\r\n\r\nScrofulous diseases are the heritage of those children who are deprived\r\nof a plentiful supply of pure air and light. A distinguished writer upon\r\nthe laws of health ascribes to the careful avoidance of the salutary\r\ninfluence of air and light by so many young girls, who are fearful of\r\nwalking out while the sun is powerful, much of their sickly appearance,\r\nthe loss of consistency of their bones, and their being able to afford\r\nbut a deformed temple to the immortal soul.\r\n\r\nHumboldt states that, during a five years' residence in South America,\r\nhe never saw any national deformity amongst the men or women belonging\r\nto the Carif, Muyscas, Indian, Mexican, or Peruvian races. If parents in\r\nour own country were to accustom their daughters from an early age to\r\ndaily exercise in the open air and sunlight, there would be fewer weak\r\nbacks requiring the support of apparatus from the surgical-instrument\r\nmaker, and less pallor in lips and cheeks to be remedied by iron from\r\nthe shop of the apothecary.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISE IN CHILDHOOD.\r\n\r\nThe first exercise which a child obtains, is had of course in its\r\nnurse's arms. Are there any directions, then, to be noticed in regard to\r\nthe _manner of carrying an infant_?--Dr. Eberle gives the following\r\nuseful advice upon this subject:--'The spine and its muscles seldom\r\nacquire sufficient strength and firmness before the end of the third\r\nmonth to enable the child to support its body in an upright position\r\nwithout inconvenience or risk of injury. Until this power is manifestly\r\nacquired, the infant should not be carried or suffered to sit with its\r\nbody erect, without supporting it in such a manner as to lighten the\r\npressure made on the spine, and aid it in maintaining the upright\r\nposture of its head and trunk; therefore, at first (a few days after\r\nbirth), the infant should be taken from its cradle or bed two or three\r\ntimes daily and laid on its back upon a pillow, and carried gently about\r\nthe chamber. After the third or fourth week, the child may be carried in\r\na reclining posture on the arms of a careful nurse, in such a manner as\r\nto afford entire support both to body and head. This may be done by\r\nreclining the infant upon the forearm, the hand embracing the upper and\r\nposterior part of the thighs, whilst its body and head are supported by\r\nresting against the breast and arm of the nurse. When held in this way,\r\nit may be gently moved from side to side, or up and down, while it is\r\ncarefully carried through a well-ventilated room.'\r\n\r\nAfter the child is three months old, it will probably have become strong\r\nenough to maintain itself in a sitting position. It may then be carried\r\nabout in this upright posture, with the spine and head carefully\r\nsupported by the nurse, which aid ought not to be withdrawn until the\r\nage of six or seven months.\r\n\r\n'In _lifting_ young children,' as has been well observed by Dr. Barlow,\r\n'the nurse should be very careful never to lay hold of them by the arms,\r\nas is sometimes thoughtlessly done; but always to place the hands, one\r\non each side of the chest, immediately below the armpits. In infancy the\r\nsockets of the joints are so shallow, and the bones so feebly bound\r\ndown and connected with each other, that dislocation and even fracture\r\nof the collar-bone may easily be produced by neglecting this rule. For\r\nthe same reason, it is a bad custom to support a child by one or even by\r\nboth arms, when he makes his first attempt to walk. The grand aim which\r\nthe child has in view, is to preserve his equilibrium. If he is\r\npartially supported by one arm, the body inclines to one side, and the\r\nattitude is rendered most unfavorable to the preservation of his natural\r\nbalance; and consequently, the moment the support is in the least\r\nrelaxed, the child falls over and is caught up with a jerk. Even when\r\nheld by both arms, the attitude is unnatural and unfavorable to the\r\nspeedy attainment of the object. To assist the child, we ought to place\r\none hand on each side of the chest in such a way as to give the\r\nslightest possible support, and to be ready instantly to give more if he\r\nlose his balance. When this plan is followed, all the attitudes and\r\nefforts of the child are in a natural direction; and success is attained\r\nnot only sooner, but more gracefully, than by any ill-judged support\r\ngiven to one side.\r\n\r\n'There is one very common mode of exercising infants, which we think\r\ndeserves particular notice: we mean the practice of hoisting or raising\r\nthem aloft in the air. This practice is of such venerable antiquity, and\r\nso universal, that it would be vain to impugn it. The pleasure, too,\r\nwhich most children evince under it, seems to show that it cannot be so\r\nobjectionable as a cursory observer would be disposed to consider it.\r\nStill there are hazards which ought not to be overlooked. The risk of\r\naccident is one of some amount: children have slipped from the hands,\r\nand sustained serious injury. Some people are so energetic as to throw\r\nup children and catch them in descending. This rashness there can be no\r\nhesitation in reprobating; for, however confident the person may be of\r\nnot missing his hold, there must ever be risks of injury from the\r\nconcussion suffered in the descent, and even from the firmness of the\r\ngrasp necessary for recovering and maintaining the hold. The motion of\r\nthe body, too, has a direct tendency to induce vertigo; and when the\r\nliability of the infant brain to congestion and its consequences is\r\nconsidered, when the frequency of hydrocephalus in infants is borne in\r\nmind, an exercise which impels blood to the brain will not be regarded\r\nas wholly insignificant. There is one more objection which seems not to\r\nhave attracted attention. The hold taken of the child in the act of\r\nhoisting him is by the hand grasping the chest. The fingers and thumb,\r\nplaced on each side of the breast-bone, compress the ribs; and any one\r\nwith the hand so placed will at once perceive that if the pressure were\r\nstrong, and the resistance from the elasticity of the ribs weak, the\r\nimpression on the chest resulting would correspond exactly with the\r\ndeformity named chicken-breast. That any force is ever used capable of\r\ninducing speedily such a change, is in the highest degree improbable;\r\nbut that reiterated pressure of this kind, however slight, would in a\r\nweakly child have power to impress and distort the chest, few, we\r\nimagine, will doubt.'\r\n\r\n\r\nLEARNING TO WALK.\r\n\r\nWhen two or three months old, the infant may be placed on a soft\r\nmattress upon the floor or on the carpet. He can then toss his limbs\r\nabout without danger, and develope the powers of his muscular system.\r\n\r\n'The best mode of teaching a child how to walk,' says Dr. Bull, 'is to\r\nlet it teach itself; and this it will do readily enough. It will first\r\nlearn to crawl: this exercises every muscle in the body, does not\r\nfatigue the child, throws no weight upon the bones, but imparts vigor\r\nand strength, and is thus highly useful. After a while, having the\r\npower, it will wish to do more. It will endeavor to lift itself upon its\r\nfeet by the aid of a chair; and though it fail again and again in its\r\nattempts, it will still persevere until it accomplish it. By this, it\r\nlearns first to raise itself from the floor; and secondly, to stand, but\r\nnot without keeping hold of the object on which it has seized. Next it\r\nwill balance itself without holding, and will proudly and laughingly\r\nshow that it can stand alone. Fearful, however, as yet of moving its\r\nlimbs without support, it will seize a chair or anything else near it,\r\nwhen it will dare to advance as far as the limits of its support will\r\npermit. This little adventure will be repeated day after day with\r\nincreased exultation; when, after numerous trials, he will feel\r\nconfident of his power to balance himself, and he will run alone. Now\r\ntime is required for this gradual self-teaching, during which the\r\nmuscles and bones become strengthened; and when at last called upon to\r\nsustain the weight of the body, are fully capable of doing so.'\r\n\r\nIt is not merely want of strength which prevents an infant from walking\r\nat first. The natural shape of the legs renders it impossible. The feet\r\nare turned in so that the inner sides look upwards. When placed upon its\r\nfeet, therefore, the soles will not rest upon the ground. In a short\r\ntime the position of the feet changes, and they become fitted for the\r\npurposes of support and locomotion. When he begins to walk, the child\r\nshould have shoes with tolerably broad soles, which ought to be at least\r\nhalf an inch longer than the foot.\r\n\r\nThe first efforts of the little one to support and propel itself are to\r\nbe carefully watched, but not unnecessarily interfered with; neither\r\nfrightened by expressions of fear, nor rendered timid by too frequent\r\nwarnings.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF GAMES AND PLAYS.\r\n\r\nThe first seven years of life should be one grand holiday for all sports\r\nand amusements which will bring into play the muscles, and divert at the\r\nsame time the mind. Time cannot be more usefully employed than in thus\r\nlaying the foundation of health, upon which alone can rest the physical,\r\nmental, and moral well-being of after-life.\r\n\r\nNo greater mistake can be made by parents than to deprive the young of\r\nthe innocent pleasures of childhood. Yet there are persons occasionally\r\nmet with who think it their duty to check the natural lightness and\r\ngaiety of heart of their children for fear that they shall become too\r\nfond of pleasure. In this way great harm is done to both mind and body,\r\nand the very fault created which it is desired to avoid.\r\n\r\nThe wise parent sees in the games and plays of childhood not only\r\nnecessary recreation and exercise, but a valuable means of education--of\r\nmoral, mental, and physical training. He also seeks to impress early\r\nupon the young mind that play is most enjoyed when it has been earned by\r\nwork, and that pleasure flies from those who continually pursue it.\r\n\r\nThe faculties of _memory_ and _attention_ can be called upon and\r\ndeveloped by proper games in a most satisfactory manner. These exercises\r\nare all the more effective because the pleasure conceals, as it were,\r\nthe mental labor, and the intellectual efforts are made, in a sense,\r\nunconsciously, though none the less efficiently.\r\n\r\nCertain plays form a valuable means of educating the eyes and other\r\nsenses. Such, for instance, are the toys which represent objects of\r\nnatural history or of different trades and arts; the pictures which\r\nteach through the quick eye of the child what no dry descriptions could\r\never convey; and the games which develope closeness of observation and\r\nhabits of order. A genial French physician has happily said, 'Every time\r\nI see a toy based on the reproduction of a scientific fact or of an\r\nindustrial process, and which pleases while it enlightens, I feel a\r\nsentiment of real gratitude to him who has designed it.'\r\n\r\nWe are glad to see that each year more and more attention is being paid\r\nto the utilization, as it were, of the games of infancy. Although all\r\neducation can never be made a play, all play can be made an effective\r\neducation. Do not therefore, reader, restrict the games of your\r\nchildren, but direct them; do not render them less amusing, but seek to\r\nmake them more instructive.\r\n\r\nThe schooling afforded by instructive plays should be the only schooling\r\nof the first seven years of life. Late springs produce the most abundant\r\nharvests in the mind as in the field. Precocious and delicate children\r\nespecially should be kept from a too early and close application to\r\nbooks. By means of healthful and instructive games and sports; by visits\r\nto workshops and factories where familiar objects are made; and by a\r\ncultivation of the sense of the beautiful in nature and art, more can be\r\ndone towards securing a sound mind in a sound body than by the easier\r\nand more common method of sending the child to school almost as soon as\r\nit can walk.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF TEACHING CHILDREN HYGIENIC HABITS.\r\n\r\nThe force of habits should never be lost sight of by those having the\r\ncharge of children. They constitute a power of which parents should\r\nearly avail themselves. J. J. Rousseau has said, 'The only habit which\r\none ought to permit the child, is of not contracting any.' But this is\r\nimpossible and undesirable. When it is remembered that _a good habit is\r\njust as hard to break as a bad one_, the importance of seeking from the\r\nvery cradle to frame good habits is evident. It is easy to create, but\r\ndifficult to reform. What then are some of the principal hygienic habits\r\nwhich it is desirable to teach children?\r\n\r\nFirst we will mention, _a liking for proper food at regular times_. The\r\nindigestion, or weakness of digestion, from which many children suffer,\r\nis in some cases hereditary or the result of feeble health. But most\r\nfrequently it is the effect of bad management. The giving to the child\r\nof pastry and cakes at meals instead of simple and nutritious food, the\r\nencouragement of capriciousness of appetite instead of teaching it to\r\nlike everything that is healthful, and the neglect to inculcate the\r\nhabit of eating at regular hours, these are the principal causes of many\r\ncases of diarrhoea, vomitings, weak appetite, colicky pains, and\r\nindigestion among children.\r\n\r\nThe daily use of at least a sponge-bath of the entire person is an\r\nexcellent habit. Cold water should be employed after the fifth or sixth\r\nyear. This simple practice of a cold sponge-bath every morning, if more\r\ngenerally taught children, would avert many a cold and rheumatic attack\r\nin after life.\r\n\r\nThe habit of quenching the thirst with only simple drinks, milk and\r\nwater, should be early and thoroughly formed. No American mother would\r\nthink of giving spirits to her child, excepting under medical advice;\r\nbut many permit almost from infancy the use of tea and coffee. These\r\ndrinks are not only unnecessary in childhood, but to a certain extent\r\ninjurious. They excite the nervous system and disorder the digestion.\r\nBefore the age of puberty, neither tea nor coffee should be allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE TRAINING OF THE SPECIAL SENSES.\r\n\r\nThe special senses, sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, have been\r\ncalled the windows of the soul, by which it observes what passes\r\nwithout. The most noble and intellectual of these are the sight and\r\nhearing. Neither of them receives the attention at the hands of parents\r\nand educators which it should. Indeed, the Indians who yet inhabit our\r\nwestern plains, have better eyes and ears than we. The reason of this is\r\nevident. The savage is obliged to make other use of his eyes than to\r\ndreamily admire the beautiful landscape, and other use of his ears than\r\nto listen to the singing of birds and the murmuring of wind and stream.\r\nThese senses are the defenders of his life. He depends upon them for\r\nfood, clothing, and protection against his enemies. Hence, urged by\r\nnecessity, he trains them from infancy, and brings them to a perfection\r\nwhich astonishes us. It will be said, however, that we in our civilized\r\nlife, have no need of any such acuteness of sense. True, but we cannot\r\navoid the consciousness that our organs of sight and hearing do not\r\nafford us the service they ought, and that they commence to fail us too\r\nearly. The remedy is to be sought in the training of the special senses\r\nin early life. These senses, which are the first of our faculties to\r\nform and develope, should be the first to be educated; yet, as has been\r\nwell said, they are nearly the only ones which are forgotten, or at\r\nleast they are the most neglected.\r\n\r\nThe education of a sense has been compared to the education of a\r\nchild,--it has its physical, its intellectual, and its moral side. It is\r\nnecessary to maintain the organ in a condition of health in order that\r\nit may perform its work well; this is the physical education of the\r\nsense. The mind must learn to properly elaborate the impressions thus\r\nconveyed to it, this is the intellectual education of the sense.\r\nFinally, in the service of morality and justice, these impressions ought\r\nto be turned to the advantage of the good and the beautiful, this is the\r\nmoral education of the sense. The subject of the training of the special\r\nsenses is therefore, when properly viewed, a serious and most important\r\none. It might well demand more attention at our hands than we have space\r\nto give it here. We will make our remarks as concise and practical as\r\npossible commencing first with\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING OF THE SENSE OF SIGHT.\r\n\r\nA recent French writer on the hygiene of the sight has brought forward\r\nstriking evidence in support of his statement, that in our time the\r\nsense of sight is growing markedly weaker. The number of the\r\nnear-sighted is augmenting, as is also the number of those who become\r\n'far-sighted' before old age. Cases of debility and disease of the eyes\r\nseem to be multiplying at a rate which should awaken general attention\r\nto this matter. The causes are to be found in the neglect, often the\r\nhurtful management, of the eyesight of children; in the influence of\r\nimproperly regulating artificial light; and in the injury done by bad\r\nprinter's ink and paper.\r\n\r\nIn the education of the child's eyesight, _acuteness_ of vision is one\r\nof the first objects to be sought for. That this is largely a matter of\r\ntraining is apparent from the fact that persons in certain professions\r\ncan readily distinguish objects too small or too distant for ordinary\r\neyes. Children brought up in the country or at the sea-side, have a\r\npower of vision unknown to city children, with their limited range of\r\nobservation. But it is not only necessary that the eyes should be able\r\nto make out the forms of distant or small objects, but that they should\r\nbe quick to detect shades of color and delicacies of outline. The child\r\nshould be stimulated and encouraged to make efforts in this direction.\r\nHere, also, there is room for the skill of the intelligent toy-maker,\r\nfor toys can be made very useful educators.\r\n\r\nOne of the forms of sensorial _memory_ which it is most desirable to\r\ndevelope is that of objects seen, that is to say, the fixing in the\r\nthoughts, to be brought up before the mind's eye when wanted, the\r\nrecollection of visual impressions. This embraces the memory of forms,\r\nof dimensions, of the relations between various objects and between\r\ndifferent parts of the same object, and of colors. When applied to\r\nplaces it is what is known as _local_ memory, applied to the human face,\r\nit is the memory of _physiognomy_; applied to objects, it is _graphic_\r\nor _descriptive_ memory; applied to colors, it is _chromatic_ memory.\r\n\r\n_Local_ memory is sometimes developed to an extraordinary degree. It is\r\nonly necessary for some persons to have once traversed a locality, a\r\nstreet, a city, in order to preserve of it a most minute and vivid\r\nrecollection. This topographical memory is enjoyed by a number of the\r\ninferior animals; the elephant, the dog, and the horse, for instance,\r\nare well-known as being capable of noticing a road taken and of\r\nreturning by it, of recognising readily a place once seen, and of\r\nshowing a tendency to stop of their own accord at places where they have\r\nbeen arrested or kept. This local memory, useful as it is to every one,\r\nis necessary to the painter who draws upon it for the elements of his\r\nartistic creations.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of recollecting faces is a peculiar one, and possessed by\r\ndifferent persons in vastly different degrees. There are those who\r\nrecognise invariably every face they have once seen, and who by a simple\r\neffort can at any time recall with the utmost distinctness the features\r\nof the absent. On the other hand, there are those so wanting in this\r\nspecial form of memory that they are constantly exposed to serious\r\nsocial inconveniences, and, for fear of failing in politeness, often\r\nsalute perfect strangers. The ancient Greeks possessed to an\r\nextraordinary degree the power of seizing and retaining types of face\r\nand form; it is to this, doubtless, that they owe, to a great extent,\r\ntheir unapproached excellence in sculpture and painting.\r\n\r\n_Graphic_ or _descriptive_ memory is that which photographs, as it were,\r\nupon the brain the visual impressions that objects have made upon the\r\nretina, in such a manner that the thought can reconstruct them ideally.\r\nThis, in particular, is the form of memory required by designers of all\r\nkinds, and, like the other forms of visual memory, is susceptible of\r\neducation. The child is first taught to copy with his pencil and produce\r\nexact _imitations_ of the objects about him. Then, little by little, he\r\nis to be taught in closing his eyes to reconstruct mentally the contours\r\nof objects, at first simple, then more complicated, and finally to\r\npenetrate into their details and give to the fictitious mental image all\r\nthe relief of reality. This exercise not merely trains the child in\r\ncorrect observation, but quickly leads to the conquest of descriptive\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n_Chromatic_ memory, or the memory of colors, is a form of visual memory\r\ndifferent from those we have enumerated. It is more difficult, perhaps,\r\nand technical than the others. The attention of the child should early\r\nbe directed to the colors of natural and artificial objects, and he\r\nshould be encouraged to imitate them.\r\n\r\nBut it is not our intention to go further into this important subject,\r\nthe education of the sense of sight. Our space will not permit it. By\r\nthese few elementary remarks, we have merely wished to remind parents\r\nthat they can do much towards the development of this important faculty\r\nin their children.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PREVENT NEAR-SIGHTEDNESS.\r\n\r\nNear-sightedness is, as we have said, greatly increasing. In Germany,\r\nthis is particularly the case, and has led there to a careful study of\r\nthe subject within the last few years.\r\n\r\nNear-sightedness, like most of the disorders of the eyesight, is to be\r\ntraced to causes which act during childhood, _and which causes are all\r\nentirely preventable_. Imperfect lighting of rooms in which children\r\nstudy or play is one of the chief among these preventable causes. When\r\nthe windows are improperly constructed or placed, or when the artificial\r\nlight is faulty in school-rooms, the book is naturally brought close to\r\nthe eyes in order that it may be more easily read. The consequence of\r\nthis is either that near-sightedness is quickly produced, or that the\r\neyes soon become fatigued and permanently weakened. No less injurious is\r\nthe effort to read 'between the lights' or before the fire. School-books\r\nwith too small type, and school-desks which are too low or too far from\r\nthe seats, are the direct cause of much mischief to many young eyes. Let\r\nparents, therefore, see to it that the school-rooms to which they send\r\ntheir children are clearly and properly lighted, that the books which\r\nthey study are printed in a bold, clear type, and that no reading or\r\nstudy is permitted by a flickering or a dim light, nor before a desk or\r\ntable which forbids a tolerably erect position of the head and\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EDUCATION OF THE SENSE OF HEARING.\r\n\r\nThe education of this sense is second only in importance to that of the\r\nsight. First of all, attention should be directed to the preservation of\r\nthe _health_ of the organ.\r\n\r\nMany cases of deafness among children originate in long standing\r\ndiseases of the nose and throat; others in obstinate skin affections;\r\nwhile not a few are caused by a want of cleanliness, which permits of\r\nthe accumulation of wax in the passage of the ear.\r\n\r\nThe sensibility of the nerve which conveys impressions of sound from the\r\near to the brain can be greatly increased by exercise and training, when\r\nthe organ is in a condition of health. It can be so highly developed\r\nthat the ear will readily catch very feeble sounds.\r\n\r\nA learned physician has recently pointed out with some force that\r\nsufficient attention is not paid to the conformation of the pavilion of\r\nthe ear. Upon this conformation much of the delicacy of hearing depends.\r\nThe hats which children wear, usually compress and deform the pavilion.\r\nPhysiologists have shown that it ought to make an angle of about thirty\r\ndegrees with the skull, in order to best collect sonorous vibrations.\r\nThis angle is very much diminished by our artificial head-dresses, and\r\nto the detriment of acuteness of hearing.\r\n\r\nCan education do much for the improvement of hearing? Everyday\r\nexperience answers in the affirmative. There is an exercise which cannot\r\nbe too highly commended to parents, which consists in inducing in play\r\ntheir children, even those very young, to detect from as far as they can\r\nfaint and fading sounds. It is a game which amuses them much, and it is\r\na pleasing sight to see the rivalry of several young children, each of\r\nwhom with head bent forward, is earnestly trying to distinguish a\r\nreceding sound longer than its fellows. A little ingenuity will readily\r\ndevise amusing and useful plays with this object in view.\r\n\r\nThe training of the remaining special senses is of comparatively minor\r\nimportance to that of those we have been considering, and need not\r\ndetain us. We will only remind the reader of the wonderful adroitness\r\nand delicacy of touch possessed by the blind as an example of what this\r\nsense is capable of when educated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME MANAGEMENT OF SOME COMMON DISEASES OF CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROUP.\r\n\r\nAlthough this disease is said to be more severe in Europe than in our\r\nown country, and more frequent in our northern than in our southern\r\nStates, most American mothers, in all parts of the country, know and\r\ndread its alarming and often fatal attacks. It is a disease of\r\nchildhood, but not of early infancy, being rarely met with under the\r\nfirst or after the tenth year of life.\r\n\r\nChildren who have once had this affection are very liable to another\r\nattack upon exposure to any of the causes which excite it. It has been\r\nnoticed also that croup runs in certain families, and not unfrequently,\r\nchildren of a ruddy complexion and of a fleshy and apparently vigorous\r\nappearance are those most subject to it.\r\n\r\nAmong the _causes of croup_, which should be specially guarded against\r\nby mothers of croupy children, are checking of the perspiration, sudden\r\nalterations in the dress, change of climate, and even in some cases a\r\nresidence at the sea-side. Croup also often follows measles, and at\r\ntimes is epidemic.\r\n\r\nThe unmistakable _symptoms of croup_ quickly show themselves at the\r\noutset of the disease. Sometimes a sore throat, a short, dry cough, and\r\na slight harshness of breathing, usher in the affection; in other\r\ninstances, that which first attracts attention is hoarseness in the cry\r\nor tone of the voice, attended with, or quickly followed by,\r\nfeverishness, thirst, and dulness, or fretfulness; while in another\r\nclass of cases the disease suddenly developes itself without any\r\nnoticeable premonitory signs. In all these cases the characteristic\r\nsymptoms of the disease commonly make their appearance at night. The\r\nchild's sleep is disturbed by a peculiar clanging cough, which, when\r\nonce heard, will ever afterwards be remembered and easily recognised.\r\nThe skin becomes hot and dry, the breathing difficult, the cough more\r\nfrequent, and the child is soon awakened, frightened, and struggling for\r\nbreath. With flushed face and staring eyes, the little sufferer starts\r\nup, grasping the throat with the hand as if seeking to remove some\r\nencircling pressure which is choking it. Each drawing in of the breath\r\nis attended with a hissing sound, the redness of the face and neck\r\nincreases, and speech becomes impossible. This attack may pass off in a\r\nfew minutes, or be prolonged, with varying degrees of intensity, for an\r\nhour. Almost invariably, however, it is followed by a period of relief,\r\nin some instances so complete as to deceive the anxious relatives into\r\nthe belief that the disease is over and the child safe. This false\r\nconfidence is, unfortunately, generally soon rudely dissipated by a\r\nreturn of the attack in all its first violence.\r\n\r\nThe disease attains its height by the end of the second, or at the\r\nlatest the close of the third day. The fever is now the hottest, the\r\ntongue becomes white, the face and forehead red and covered with\r\nperspiration, the lips at times purple, the veins of the neck and\r\ntemples distended, the countenance distressed, and the voice whispered\r\nor suppressed. The cough is now also most frequent and noisy; its\r\npeculiar sound has been compared to that made by a fowl when caught in\r\nthe hand. The thirst is great, but swallowing difficult. The child often\r\ninserts its fingers in the mouth as if trying to clutch something which\r\ncloses the air passages. These symptoms may either increase to the rapid\r\nexhaustion of the patient or take a favorable turn. One of the first\r\nevidences of the latter is a change in the character of the cough,\r\nwhich, although it may not lessen in force or frequency, becomes lower\r\nin tone, less dry, and finally moist.\r\n\r\nThe _treatment_ should be most prompt, active, and energetic. Few\r\ndiseases require, for the safety of the patient, such quick and\r\nefficient aid at the outset. Prepare at once sufficient hot water for a\r\nbath, and make a fire in the room. In the meanwhile, immerse the child's\r\narms in some hot water, and apply cloths, wrung thoroughly dry from it,\r\nto the throat. Give the child a tea-spoonful of powdered alum in a\r\nlittle syrup, molasses and water, or honey. Repeat the dose in a quarter\r\nof an hour if full vomiting be not excited by the first tea-spoonful. So\r\nsoon as the warm bath is ready (the water should have the temperature\r\nof 98° Fahrenheit), place the child in it, and keep up the heat of the\r\nbath by the occasional addition of hot water. Have hot towels in\r\nreadiness to dry the skin completely, and a warm blanket in which to\r\nwrap the patient. See that the temperature of the room is raised to\r\nabout 66° Fahrenheit, and that it does not fall below this. Moisten the\r\nair by putting a kettle of boiling water on the fire and diffusing the\r\nsteam from it by means of a long roll of paper fixed to the spout.\r\n\r\nThe warm bath and the emetic will usually relieve the breathing; but no\r\nmatter how complete this relief may appear to be, nor how quietly the\r\nlittle one may sleep, it must be carefully watched all night, so that\r\nthe first return of unfavorable symptoms may be promptly treated. In all\r\ninstances also, however favorably the case may progress, the patient\r\nmust be confined to bed for several days, and the temperature of the\r\nroom, and the moisture of the air, carefully maintained, as directed for\r\nthe first treatment of the attack. If the child has had previous\r\nattacks, or if the weather be cold and inclement, it should be kept in\r\nthis warm moist atmosphere for two weeks. Were these precautions known\r\nand heeded we should have to lament fewer fatal cases of croup.\r\n\r\nOf course in this, as in all other serious diseases, skilled medical\r\nadvice should be secured as quickly as possible. We have given the above\r\ndirections, not only for those so situated that they cannot secure\r\nmedical aid, but also for all others, in order that no valuable time may\r\nbe lost in commencing the treatment, that the efforts of the physician\r\nmay be intelligently seconded and carried out, and that the importance\r\nof _promptness_ at the outset, and _prolonged care_ during\r\nconvalescence, maybe impressed upon every mother who consults these\r\npages.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAD COLDS.\r\n\r\nYoung infants are very liable to take cold when being washed, or carried\r\nabout the house into rooms and passages of different temperatures. This\r\ncold often shows itself by sneezing and \"snuffles\" in the nose. In a\r\nshort time a discharge from the nostrils appears, the eyes become\r\nwatery, and the voice sounds \"through the nose.\" The skin is hotter than\r\nnatural, and the infant cross. If the child be able to talk, it will\r\ncomplain of headache, some soreness in the limbs and back, and of a\r\nburning, uncomfortable feeling in the nose. These symptoms last for\r\nthree or four days, when in mild ordinary cases they begin to disappear.\r\nAfter one or more attacks of this kind the child is very liable to a\r\nreturn on every slight exposure to cold.\r\n\r\nThe _treatment_ required in these cases is mild and simple, but must not\r\nbe neglected. A warm bath should be taken at bed-time for a number of\r\ndays; the patient should be kept in an even temperature and out of\r\ndraughts. The best relief to the distress in the nose, from which the\r\nchild suffers, is afforded by dipping a hollow sponge in hot water,\r\nsqueezing it nearly dry, and applying it over the nose and forehead. The\r\ncommon domestic practice of greasing the nose is also beneficial. The\r\nwearing of a flannel cap until the disease is cured is a remedy\r\nstrongly recommended by the late Dr. Meigs. A flannel cap will also\r\noften prevent the recurrence of the complaint in those very subject to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nFITS.\r\n\r\nInfants and young children are much more liable to fits and convulsions\r\nthan adults. The causes which excite them are numerous, and should be\r\ngenerally known, that they may be as far as possible avoided.\r\n\r\nMany infants are born with a tendency to fits. The children of feeble\r\nparents, or of those who have married very early or very late in life,\r\nare apt to be afflicted with a predisposition to them. Great fright or\r\nsevere shock received by the mother during the latter months of her\r\npregnancy may give rise to convulsions in the child soon after birth.\r\n\r\nPale, badly nourished, soft, flabby children, and those of a sensitive,\r\nnervous temperament, are more liable to fits than those who are ruddy\r\nand hardy. Hence we find convulsions more common and fatal among the\r\npoor and miserable than among the 'well-to-do' and comfortable. City\r\nchildren are more subject to the complaint than the country born and\r\nbred.\r\n\r\nFits are very frequent among infants while teething. In such cases\r\nlancing the gum secures immediate relief. Another cause of fits, and one\r\nwhich every mother should know, is the giving of meat to the child\r\nbefore its teeth are cut. In such cases the attack is sudden, and often\r\nvery severe. Children most affected in this way by animal food are those\r\nwith water on the brain, and those of a very delicate constitution. The\r\njuice or broth of meat is in some such instances sufficient to produce\r\nfits. The remedy consists in the institution of a milk diet. In all\r\ndoubtful cases avoid a meat diet in any form, and watch the result.\r\n\r\nStrong mental emotions, such as fright, shame, or anger, may cause a fit\r\nin a child. A nurse in England threatened to throw a child out of the\r\nwindow if he did not stop crying; the little boy fell at once into\r\nconvulsions, from which he died.\r\n\r\nAmong other known causes of fits are confinement to heated, badly\r\nventilated rooms, tight bandaging, and sudden exposure to severe cold or\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the influence of the mother's mind over the nursing child\r\n(p. 251), we mentioned a number of instances of children thrown into\r\nconvulsions by changes in the quality of the milk caused by the mental\r\nemotion of the mother. The importance of the subject induces us to quote\r\nhere the corroborating remarks of Dr. Churchill, in the last edition of\r\nhis standard work on diseases of children. 'During the first year of\r\nlife, convulsions may not unfrequently be traced to the milk of the\r\nmother or nurse disagreeing with the infant, or having been disordered\r\ntemporarily by fright, passion, or suffering. Soemmering mentions a\r\ncurious case of a woman whose milk agreed with her own child, but caused\r\nconvulsions in all others. M. Guersant relates the instance of a woman\r\ndeserted by her husband, and in her distress her infant had an attack\r\neach time it took the breast. Dr. Underwood mentions a mother who nursed\r\nher child immediately after witnessing a sudden death; the child was\r\nattacked by convulsions, after which it remained comatose for thirty-six\r\nhours, but ultimately recovered. Numerous cases are on record of\r\nconvulsions supervening upon violent passion in the nurse. I have\r\nwitnessed more than one case resulting from the mother suckling her\r\nchild during a time of severe affliction and distress.'\r\n\r\nWe deem it useless to describe a fit. Almost every one has seen it, and\r\nat once recognises it. We shall proceed, therefore, at once to the\r\n_treatment._\r\n\r\nWhen a child is attacked with a fit the dress should be loosened, all\r\ntight bandages and pins removed, and plenty of fresh air admitted into\r\nthe room. It should not be held upright in the arms, but placed in a\r\nlying position. A warm bath (that most useful remedy in so many of the\r\nailments of children) should be speedily prepared, and the child\r\nimmersed for a few minutes, then removed, dried, and wrapped in a\r\nblanket. A hot mustard foot-bath is also of service. The cause of the\r\nfit should be at once sought, for upon it will of course depend to a\r\ngreat extent the treatment required. If the child be teething, and the\r\ngums be found to be red and swollen, they should be lanced. If the child\r\nhas eaten too much, or of improper food, an emetic should be given. A\r\nlittle mustard and salt mixed in a tumbler of warm water affords a\r\nready, safe, and effectual emetic.\r\n\r\nThe dashing of cold water upon the face will sometimes promptly end the\r\nfit. The application of powdered ice in a bladder, or of cold water\r\ncloths to the head, is of service where the face is much flushed and the\r\nmovements very violent.\r\n\r\nChildren subject to fits should live in a well warmed house. By this we\r\ndo not mean that the rooms and hall ways should be kept hot, still less\r\nthat they should be close and improperly ventilated. The temperature of\r\nthe bed-room should not be lower than 70 degrees, and great care should\r\nbe taken during cold weather to avoid chilling the child outdoors.\r\n\r\nRubbing of the child's body once a day with good salad oil is an\r\nexcellent and readily applied remedy in these cases. The little patients\r\ndo not ordinarily object to it. As it is a procedure calculated to\r\nimprove the general health, we strongly recommend every mother whose\r\nchild has frequent fits, to try it.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the child should be warm, loose, and comfortable. Perfect\r\nquietness is important for a time after attacks. Do not excite the child\r\nby seeking to amuse it. Let it sleep as much as it will.\r\n\r\nIn those cases in which a fit has been followed by weakness of the\r\nlimbs, medical assistance will of course be procured. As a rule,\r\nrecovery in such instances is slow, but, when properly directed,\r\nperfect. Change of scene, country air, and exercise, friction of the\r\nbody with a flesh-brush or salt towel, salt water baths, and\r\nelectricity, are all valuable agents towards cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOSE-BLEED.\r\n\r\nBleeding from the nose may be produced by a blow or by over-exercise of\r\nthe child at play. In either case the trouble is usually a trifling\r\none. Some children, however, are liable to attacks of nose-bleed coming\r\non without any assignable causes. One of the consequences of scarlet\r\nfever and whooping cough is sometimes a tendency to repeated and serious\r\nspells of bleeding from the nose.\r\n\r\nThe _treatment_ in these cases consists in quieting the alarm of the\r\nchild if it be frightened, and in applying cold water or pounded ice to\r\nthe nose and forehead and to the back of the neck. It is because of its\r\ncoldness that the key placed down the back, as so commonly advised in\r\ndomestic practice, does good.\r\n\r\nAn exaggerated idea of the amount of blood lost is often a cause of\r\ndistress to parents. They forget that the child has been bleeding in a\r\nvessel of water, and that a very little blood darkly colors a large\r\nquantity of water.\r\n\r\nBleeding from the nose is sometimes a favorable symptom, as when it\r\noccurs during a fever, or when in girls approaching womanhood it\r\nprecedes the expected signs of puberty. It is an unfavorable symptom,\r\nhowever, in scrofulous children and in girls affected with\r\ngreen-sickness, as in these instances it aggravates the existing\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\nIn those rare cases of protracted bleeding which resist the remedies we\r\nhave mentioned, it may be necessary for the surgeon to plug the\r\nnostrils, both in front and at their opening into the throat.\r\n\r\nThis extreme measure is fortunately scarcely ever called for, and can\r\nonly be carried out by the physician.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMS.\r\n\r\nChildren are often thought to have worms when entirely free from them.\r\nThere is hardly a symptom of any disease which has not been supposed by\r\nsome to be a sign of the presence of worms. A child suffering from some\r\nother complaint is, therefore, not unfrequently dosed with vermifuges to\r\nits injury. We can give the mother one symptom of worms which is\r\ninfallible. It is the only one upon which she can rely, namely, the\r\ndetection of worms in the stools of the child. Until these expelled\r\nintruders are actually found she should be slow to believe that the\r\nchild is thus affected, and still slower to give worm medicine. Before\r\nbeginning treatment, let the mother wait until the need of it is made\r\nout by the result of the examination we have mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe _treatment_ of the ordinary worms to which children are subject is\r\nsimple and usually speedily efficacious. Commence with a dose of Epsom\r\nsalts, of magnesia, or of cream of tartar, as may be preferred. The next\r\nday administer a vermifuge, of which the best and pleasantest is\r\n_santonine_. Obtain from the druggist three or four three-grain powders\r\nof this medicine. Give the half or the whole of one of these powders,\r\naccording to the age of the child, at bed-time. The next morning\r\nadminister a purgative dose of oil or salts. Repeat this treatment every\r\nother day until three doses of santonine have been taken. Or, from two\r\nto six grains, according to the age of the patient, may be dissolved in\r\ntwo table-spoonsful of castor-oil, and a tea-spoonful given every hour\r\nuntil it operates.\r\n\r\nAn excellent domestic remedy for worms, one which was a great favorite\r\nwith the celebrated Dr. Rush of Philadelphia, is common salt. For a\r\nchild two or three years old, the proper dose is a tea-spoonful mixed in\r\na wine-glassful of water. When the child can be got to take it in\r\nsufficient quantity, this remedy is a very efficient one.\r\n\r\nMost cases of supposed worms in children are best treated by regulating\r\nthe diet, by attention to the air and exercise of the child, by warm\r\nbaths, and by endeavoring to improve the appetite, the digestion, and\r\nthe strength. The food should be plain and unirritating (bread, milk,\r\nrice, arrowroot, chicken, lamb or mutton broth, beef-tea, mutton chop,\r\nyoung chicken); the meals should be taken in smaller quantities than\r\nusual, and at regular intervals. Sweets and confectionery should be\r\nforbidden, and but few vegetables permitted for awhile. A perseverance\r\nin this regimen for a short time will usually cure the little patient\r\nwithout the necessity of resorting to any vermifuge.\r\n\r\nWorms are most frequent between the ages of three and ten years. Girls\r\nare oftener affected than boys. A tendency to worms is hereditary. Cases\r\noccur more frequently during the spring and autumn than during the other\r\nseasons. A residence in cold, damp, unhealthy situations leads to their\r\nproduction in many instances.\r\n\r\n\r\nBED-WETTING.\r\n\r\nThis troublesome disorder is not unfrequently met with in children--more\r\nespecially boys--under twelve years of age. It is a mistake to suppose,\r\nas is done by some parents, that slothfulness or negligence is the\r\ninvariable and only cause of this infirmity; on this point Dr. Vogel\r\nsays:--'In most cases which I have observed, the children through their\r\nown sense of honor or on account of repeated punishments, had a lively\r\ninterest in avoiding the accident, and yet were unable to do this\r\nwithout appropriate treatment pursued for months, and even years.' Dr.\r\nTanner states:--'Very frequently this affection is the consequence of\r\nbad habits; being favored by the free use of fluids during the after\r\npart of the day, by exposure to cold in the night, and by lying on the\r\nback.'\r\n\r\nThe presence of worms in the bowels is one of the causes of this\r\nannoying ailment, and they should be sought for in all cases. Stone in\r\nthe bladder sometimes occasions the affection, but in such instances\r\nother symptoms will soon point to the true nature of the trouble.\r\n\r\nThis subject is one of an importance which demands some attention from\r\nus in a work for parents. In the language of Dr. Vogel, 'the effects of\r\nthis malady are unpleasant, for the psychical development in particular\r\nsuffers. The repeated punishments which these children undergo blunt\r\ntheir sense of honor considerably; they become cowardly and deceitful,\r\nand have no personal spirit. If great and expensive cleanliness is not\r\npractised, the bed, and even the whole room, acquires a urinous odor,\r\nwhich contaminates the atmosphere and begets conditions by no means\r\nfavorable to healthy growth. Such children may be ultimately attacked by\r\nindolent ulcers on the nates and lower extremities, the results of\r\nurinous excoriations.'\r\n\r\nThe only _symptom_ ordinarily present is that the child towards morning\r\nor in the middle of the night wets the bed without waking. This may\r\nhappen several times during the sleep, and recur every night. In some\r\ncases the act takes place only every other night, but it is rare that\r\nthere is an interval of more than one night.\r\n\r\nThe _cause_ of this failing is sometimes very simple and one easily\r\nremedied; for it is often the result of neglecting to take young\r\nchildren up once during the many hours they require for sleep. By\r\nattention to this matter and to the diet, the habit may be speedily\r\nbroken. Unfortunately most cases are not so quickly amenable to\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nIn the _treatment_ of this infirmity, corporal punishment should not be\r\nthought of. It is useless, cruel, and unnatural. The child might as well\r\nbe punished because it squints or has club-foot.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken to see that the little patient eats or drinks nothing\r\nfor several hours before bed-time. The child should also be awakened a\r\nlittle before midnight, and at a very early hour in the morning, and\r\nmade to empty its bladder. It is of great importance to get the child to\r\nsleep upon its side or face, as lying upon the back is sure to increase\r\nthe trouble. Indeed, it is frequently observed that the child always\r\nremains clean when it is prevented from turning upon its back during\r\nsleep. The difficulty lies in the prevention. The plan of tying a cloth\r\nor towel around the child with a knot over the spinal column, to awaken\r\nit by the pain when it rolls over upon the back, so often proposed,\r\nseems good advice easily followed. But practically it fails, as it is\r\nimpossible, without making the bandage too tight, to keep it in place.\r\nThe benefit which, in some instances, has followed the employment of a\r\nsuccession of small blisters directly over the lower part of the spinal\r\ncolumn, is doubtless due to their forcing the child to sleep upon the\r\nface or side. The remedy is somewhat a painful one, but should be tried\r\nin obstinate cases.\r\n\r\nThe child's general health, if enfeebled, should be improved by cold\r\nbaths, bitter tonics, and if possible a change of air. In no case should\r\nany mechanical means be employed to arrest the infirmity. Serious and\r\neven fatal results have followed such attempts.\r\n\r\nIf the precautions and simple remedies we have mentioned fail, recourse\r\nmust be had to the family physician. The drugs which are of benefit are\r\ntoo powerful to be entrusted to any other hands. The hygienic method of\r\ncure we have pointed out will, if instituted early, be effectual in all\r\nexcepting very obstinate cases, which latter indeed sometimes resist for\r\na long time the best efforts of medical skill.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOOSENESS OF THE BOWELS.\r\n\r\nChildren under one year of age should have two movements of the bowels\r\nin the twenty-four hours, and those from one to three years at least\r\none stool a day.\r\n\r\nA slight attack of looseness is often beneficial if it passes away\r\nwithin a day or two. It is easy, however, for such an attack to become\r\nhurtful, especially if the food be improper, or the weather warm. A\r\nlooseness which is of no consequence in the winter may well excite\r\nuneasiness during the summer months.\r\n\r\nDiarrhoea in a healthy child is ordinarily preceded by vomiting. If the\r\ndiarrhoea persist long, the little patient is much prostrated by it, and\r\nrapidly reduced in flesh. Such an attack should never, therefore, be\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nIn the case of an infant not weaned, it should be removed from the\r\nbreast for half a day or more, that the stomach may have little or\r\nnothing to do. Barley or rice water, or ordinary water, may be given in\r\nsmall quantities at a time to relieve the thirst. This in many cases\r\nwill be all the treatment required.\r\n\r\nIn the case of an elder child, all meat and vegetables should be at once\r\nforbidden, and the only food allowed for a day or two must be rice and\r\nmilk, arrowroot, or milk and water.\r\n\r\nThe dose of castor oil which is so frequently given by nurses in these\r\ncases under the impression that the oil is 'healing,' is only of service\r\nwhen the diarrhoea has been caused by food of improper quality or\r\nquantity. It then aids nature in her efforts to get rid of the offending\r\nmatter, which by its irritation is doing the mischief. In such instances\r\none dose of the oil is quite sufficient. It has no 'healing' virtues,\r\nand should not be repeated from day to day.\r\n\r\nChildren who are teething are frequently affected with looseness. A warm\r\nbath every evening, and attention to the gums, will be ordinarily all\r\nthat is required in these cases, at least during the cold months. It is\r\nof the utmost importance, however, during the summer that such patients,\r\nif living in the city, should be at once removed into the country;\r\notherwise their lives are in danger.\r\n\r\nLooseness of the bowels in children is usually best treated by careful\r\nmanagement of the clothing and diet, by attention to all that affects\r\nthe health, and by avoiding as much as possible the administration of\r\nmedicines. No case should be allowed, however, to run on without seeking\r\ncompetent medical advice.\r\n\r\nAn excellent remedy for the diarrhoea of children is the subnitrate of\r\nbismuth.\r\n\r\nThis medicine may be disguised in the food, as in a case narrated by Dr.\r\nInmann. A lad about ten years old was brought to him by an aunt, who\r\nstated that the boy suffered much from diarrhoea, and was emaciating\r\nvisibly; that he would not try any domestic remedy, was an obstinate\r\nfellow, and determined to take no medicine. After sending the lad to\r\nanother room the doctor recommended the lady to get some white bismuth\r\nand give it to the cook, telling her to mix a large pinch of it with\r\nsome butter, and to send in the bread and butter so arranged that the\r\nlady would know which was for the boy. This was done. The lad was duly\r\ndrugged without his knowledge, and the diarrhoea stopped in two days.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION.\r\n\r\nInfants and young children suffer often from indigestion, or\r\n_dyspepsia_, as well as adults. One of the most frequent signs of this\r\ndisorder is vomiting. But every infant which throws up its milk is not\r\nsuffering from indigestion. Vomiting is sometimes a sign of health, and\r\nshows that the stomach is vigorous enough to free itself promptly from\r\nexcess of food. The child is thus saved from the effects of\r\nover-feeding. The obvious remedy is to diminish the quantity of milk\r\ntaken at each nursing or meal.\r\n\r\nBut vomiting from over-feeding is very different from that caused by\r\nirritation of the stomach, which causes it to reject proper food. The\r\ncommon sense of the mother will enable her easily to distinguish between\r\nthe two sorts. In the former, the child remains cheerful, happy, and\r\nwell nourished, scarcely changing countenance even while the\r\nsuperabundant milk is being returned from its stomach. In the latter,\r\nthe child soon becomes pale, feeble, and distressed looking.\r\nOver-feeding, if persisted in, may occasion indigestion.\r\n\r\nIndigestion during the first year of life shows itself by languor,\r\npallor, and evident discomfort. The child wishes to be constantly at the\r\nbreast, and suckles eagerly, but vomits the milk shortly after, usually\r\ncurdled. The bowels are either constipated or too loose. The most\r\nprominent and often the only symptoms are this alternation of vomiting\r\nand an eager desire to take the breast, associated with loss of flesh\r\nand strength. The child is evidently not nourished by the food it takes,\r\nand if relief be not afforded it sinks, and dies from starvation in the\r\ncourse of a month or two.\r\n\r\nChildren who are _weaned abruptly, and at a very early period_, are\r\nliable to a serious form of indigestion, which may come on in a few days\r\nafter weaning, or not for several weeks.\r\n\r\nOlder children are liable to slight attacks of indigestion, which are\r\nattended with vomiting or purging, or both, for a few days, when the\r\nstomach recovers its health. In some cases, however, the derangement\r\ncontinues longer, the child then losing its appetite, and suffering from\r\ncolic, and becoming fretful, pale, and weak. The breath becomes sour,\r\nand the passages green. Such cases require careful watching and\r\ntreatment, especially during the hot weather of the summer.\r\n\r\nIn infants at the breast indigestion is usually caused by giving the\r\nbreast too often or by an excess or change in the quality of the milk.\r\nErrors in diet on the part of the mother, and other faults which we have\r\npointed out in our chapter on nursing, are the most frequent causes of\r\nthis ailment. In children who are weaned the causes are almost\r\ninvariably improper food or food taken too frequently, or in too large\r\nquantities. The hint should be taken when a child rejects its food, to\r\nchange it, or give it less. Instead of this, too frequently the child is\r\nurged to take more, and thus derange the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe _treatment_ of indigestion in childhood is usually easy and\r\nsatisfactory. The first thing is to look to and regulate the quantity\r\nand quality of the food. If it be due to excess of food, this is easily\r\nremedied. If due to improper quality, change it promptly. When the\r\nmother's health is such that her milk is found to frequently or\r\nconstantly disagree with her child, a suitable wet-nurse must be\r\nprocured.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the attack is mild, and readily yields to a few hours'\r\nabstinence from food. As it often happens, especially in\r\nartificially-fed infants, that the gastric juice is more acid than it\r\nshould be, great benefit is derived from the use of _precipitated chalk\r\nor carbonate of soda_. A few grains of either of these, given several\r\ntimes a day for a few days, will be found to effect a surprising change\r\nand alone restore the appetite and digestion.\r\n\r\nIn older children an attack of indigestion should be the signal for\r\nputting them upon a simpler and more restricted diet for a time. Milk,\r\neggs, arrowroot, tapioca, sago, panada, &c., are better than animal\r\nfood. If the child becomes much weakened, jellies, chicken, lamb,\r\nmutton, or oyster broth, beef tea, or wine whey, should be given to\r\ncheck the tendency to exhaustion.\r\n\r\nWe repeat, that most cases of indigestion in infants and children yield\r\npromptly to an immediate change in the diet, without medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nHINTS ON HOME GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, as it may be regarded as outside of our domain of\r\nhygiene, we have but few words to say. We wish, however, in the\r\ninterests of medicine and hygiene, to insist upon the necessity of\r\ntraining children to prompt, implicit obedience to the parental voice.\r\nAs physicians, we have seen the spoilt, undisciplined child, when sick,\r\nrebellious alike to persuasion and command, refusing food and medicine,\r\nrevolting against the slightest examination, and by its violence and\r\ncapriciousness, converting a slight illness into a dangerous one. For a\r\nchild unaccustomed to obedience there is no proper treatment possible\r\nwhen sick; nor when well is there any proper care possible for the\r\npreservation of the health. What it wants, and not what it ought to\r\nhave, is given it, and every one knows that a child's instincts are no\r\nguide to health. With health, happiness is sacrificed also. There is no\r\nsurer way of making a child miserable than by accustoming it to obtain\r\nall it wishes, and to encounter no will but its own. Its desires grow by\r\nwhat they feed upon. As a French writer on education has well expressed\r\nit: 'At first it will want the cane you hold in your hand, then your\r\nwatch, then the bird it sees flying in the air, and then the star\r\ntwinkling overhead. How, short of omnipotence, is it possible to gratify\r\nits ever-growing wants?' Accustom the child to hear 'no' and 'must,' but\r\nlet these hard words be softened by voice and manner--an art in which\r\nevery true mother excels.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, do not harass the child by needless\r\nrestrictions, nor worry it by excess of management. We desire to call\r\nattention here to the words of an eminent English divine and learned\r\nwriter, Archbishop Whately:--\r\n\r\n'Most carefully should we avoid the error which some parents, not\r\n(otherwise) deficient in good sense commit, of imposing gratuitous\r\nrestrictions and privations, and purposely inflicting needless\r\ndisappointments, for the purpose of inuring children to the pains and\r\ntroubles they will meet with in after life. Yes; be assured they _will_\r\nmeet with quite _enough_ in every portion of life, including childhood,\r\nwithout your strewing their paths with thorns of your own providing. And\r\noften enough you will have to limit their amusements for the sake of\r\nneedful study, to restrain their appetites for the sake of health, to\r\nchastise them for faults, and in various ways to inflict pain or\r\nprivations for the sake of avoiding some greater evils. Let this always\r\nbe explained to them whenever it is possible to do so; and endeavor in\r\nall cases to make them look on the parent as never the _voluntary_ giver\r\nof anything but good. To any hardships which they are convinced you\r\ninflict reluctantly, and to those which occur through the dispensation\r\nof the All-wise, they will more easily be trained to submit with a good\r\ngrace, than to any gratuitous sufferings devised for them by fallible\r\nman. To raise hopes on purpose to produce disappointment, to give\r\nprovocation merely to exercise the temper, and, in short, to inflict\r\npain of any kind, merely as a training for patience and fortitude--this\r\nis a kind of discipline which man should not presume to attempt. If such\r\ntrials prove a discipline not so much of cheerful fortitude as of\r\nresentful aversion and suspicious distrust of the parent as a capricious\r\ntyrant, you will have only yourself to thank for the result.' It is a\r\nmatter of common observation that those who complain of their fortune\r\nand lot in life have often to complain only of their own conduct. The\r\nsame is true of those who complain of their children. They have\r\nthemselves only to blame in each case.\r\n\r\nParents who do not appreciate the responsibilities of their position\r\nusually err on the side of over-indulgence to their children; on the\r\ncontrary, those fully alive to the importance of home discipline often\r\nerr on the side of over-regulation. To the latter, we commend the reply\r\nof an old lady to the anxious inquiry made by the mother of a too\r\nrigorously disciplined child as to what course should be pursued, 'I\r\nrecommend, my dear, a little wholesome neglect.'\r\n\r\nLessons of truthfulness; of fortitude in bearing pain and\r\ndisappointment; of the duty of right doing, because it is right and not\r\nbecause it is the best policy; of frugality and industry; of\r\nself-denial, contentment, and charity, should be early impressed upon\r\nthe plastic mind of infancy. We wish also, in this connection, to quote\r\nthe words of a wise physician and observer of men, that 'the little\r\nchild who is brought up to repeat short and simple prayers at his\r\nmother's knees, has a rule of conduct thereby instilled into him which\r\nwill probably never be forgotten; and, in after life he may not only\r\nlook back to these beginnings with feelings of reverence and love, but\r\nthe recollection of them may serve to strengthen him in some good\r\nresolution, and help him to resist many a powerful temptation.'\r\n\r\nWe have had occasion frequently in various parts of this work to point\r\nout the intimate relations which exist between the physical and mental\r\nnature of parents and their offspring. Like parent, like child. The same\r\nclose connection and sympathy extends to the moral and religious\r\ncharacter; hence that direction and training which relies largely upon\r\nthe _force of parental example_ is the most effective method of home\r\ngovernment. Virtuous precepts, or rigidly enforced rules of conduct,\r\navail little unless the parent keeps the path to which he points the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n'Well, upon my word, Mrs. Primrose, you have the handsomest children in\r\nthe whole country.' 'Ah! neighbor,' replied the wife of the Vicar of\r\nWakefield, 'they are as heaven made them--handsome enough if they be\r\ngood enough--handsome is that handsome does.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIS THE RACE DEGENERATING?\r\n\r\nThis is a question which perplexes some minds in our times. A German\r\nauthor of note has recently written a volume to prove that each\r\ngeneration is feebler than the preceding. Old physicians say that in\r\ntheir youth diseases of exhaustion were rarer than now-a-days. For this\r\nour habits of life, the pressure on our nervous systems, the prevalence\r\nof hereditary diseases, and the excessive use of narcotics and\r\nstimulants, are held responsible. 'The fathers,' say these croakers,\r\n'have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.'\r\n\r\nWe attach little weight to these gloomy views. There are plenty of facts\r\non the other side. The suits of old armour still preserved in our\r\nmuseums prove that, as a rule, we have slightly gained in weight and\r\nsize. Tables of life insurance companies and reports of statistics show\r\nthat the average length of human life is greater than it ever was. Dr.\r\nCharles D. Meigs used to state in his lectures that the size of the head\r\nof American infants at birth is somewhat greater than in the Old World.\r\n\r\nThat there are more numerous diseases than formerly, is not true; but it\r\nis true that we know more, for we have learned to detect them more\r\nreadily and to examine them more minutely. This is especially true of\r\nsuch as are peculiar to women. Within the last ten or twenty years so\r\nmuch that is of sovereign importance has been contributed to this\r\ndepartment of medical science, that it is hardly possible for one to\r\nbecome an expert in it unless he gives it his whole attention.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the tendency to debilitated frames and chronic diseases, woman\r\nshould therefore learn not only the laws of her own physical life, but\r\nthe relations in which she stands to the other sex. Thus she can guard\r\nher own health, and preserve her offspring from degeneracy. It is only\r\nby enlightenment, and the extension of knowledge on the topics relating\r\nto soundness of body and mind, that we can found rational hopes of a\r\npermanent and wide-spread improvement of the race.\r\n\r\nSome have maintained, not understanding the bearing of the facts, that\r\nsuch degeneracy is more conspicuous in the frame of woman than anywhere\r\nelse. They quote the narratives of travellers, who describe with what\r\nfortitude--we might almost say with what indifference--the Indian women,\r\nand those of other savage races, bear the pangs of childbirth, and how\r\nlittle the ordeal weakens them. A squaw will turn aside for an hour or\r\ntwo when on the march, bear a child, wash it in some stream, bind it on\r\nthe top of her load, and shouldering both, quietly rejoin the vagrant\r\ntroop. Our artificial life seems indeed, in this respect, to be to\r\nblame; but if we look closer, we can learn that these wild women often\r\nperish alone, that they are rarely fertile, that unnatural labors are\r\nnot unknown, and that the average duration of their life is decidedly\r\nless than among the females in civilised States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEALTH IN MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE PERILS OF MATERNITY._\r\n\r\nIn the early part of this work we quoted some authorities to show that\r\nthose women who choose single life as their portion do not escape the\r\nills of existence, nor do they protract their days, but, on the\r\ncontrary, as shown by extensive statistics, are more prone to affections\r\nof the mind, and die earlier. While, therefore, nature thus rewards\r\nthose who fulfil the functions of their being, by taking part in the\r\nmysterious processes of reproduction, and perpetuating the drama of\r\nexistence, it is true also that she associates these privileges with\r\ncertain deprivations and suffering. We do not wish to throw around the\r\nmarried state any charms which are not its own. Rather is it our aim to\r\nportray with absolute, and therefore instructive, fidelity all that this\r\ncondition offers of unfavorable as well as favorable aspects.\r\n\r\nLet us say at once, maternity has its perils,--perils as peculiar and as\r\ninevitable as those which pertain to single life. Our present purpose is\r\nto mention these, and by stating their nature and what are their causes,\r\nso far as known, to put married women on their guard against them. Some\r\nare almost trifling, at least not involving danger to life; others most\r\nharassing to the sufferer and to her friends.\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider the principal diseases to which married women are\r\nexposed from pregnancy, from childbirth, and from nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\nIn treating of pregnancy we have pointed out that it was a healthy and\r\nhappy condition to most women. The exceptional cases are mainly those in\r\nwhich the health is injured by mental trouble or anxiety. Thus the young\r\nand delicate girl newly married is full of vague alarms in regard to the\r\npains and dangers of her untried path to maternity. She frets herself\r\nand embitters her life during those months in which tranquility is of\r\nthe utmost importance. Is it surprising, then, that her health should be\r\ndisordered, and that she should suffer from some of the diseases\r\nincident to the pregnant state?\r\n\r\nAgain, the mother of a large family, but the mistress of a small income,\r\nis distressed by the thought of additional expense, which it seems to\r\nher, particularly in her nervous state, impossible to meet. This\r\ncondition of protracted anxiety is ill fitted to enable her to resist\r\nany tendency to disease to which she may be exposed. Indeed, prolonged\r\nvexation from these and other causes not unfrequently tend to _puerperal\r\nmania_ (a disease of which we shall shortly have something to say), or\r\nto some other nervous affection.\r\n\r\nThe wife during pregnancy should therefore be treated with unusual\r\nkindness by those about her, and every attempt made to soften her lot.\r\nThe erroneous impression prevails among some that the pregnant wife\r\nshould enure herself to toil and hardship. This notion is doubtless due\r\nto the observation that domestic animals that are subjected to a life of\r\nlabor bring forth their young with little suffering. 'The cow in the\r\ncountry farm living unfettered in the meadow until the day of calving,\r\nhas in general a safe and easy labor. The poor beast, on the contrary,\r\nwhich is kept in a town dairy, has a time so incredibly dangerous that\r\nthe proprietor generally sells off his stock every year, and replaces it\r\nwith cows in calf; such cows not being put into the stalls till within\r\nsix or eight days of the expected period of labor. The deduction from\r\nthis is that an artificial mode of life--a life maintained by improper\r\nfood, and without a sufficient supply of pure air, or a due amount of\r\nexercise--has a most deleterious influence upon the process of labor;\r\nand not that a toilsome existence, embittered with all the pains and\r\nanxieties of poverty, gives comparative immunity from danger in the hour\r\nof childbirth.' One of the discomforts of pregnancy is--\r\n\r\n\r\nMORNING SICKNESS.\r\n\r\nThis affection, when confined, as is usually the case, to the morning\r\nand early part of the day, rarely requires much medical care. Its\r\nabsence, which, as we have said, is a frequent cause of miscarriage, is\r\nmore to be regretted than its presence especially as it is apt to be\r\nreplaced by more serious troubles.\r\n\r\nRelief will be afforded by washing the face and hands in cold water, and\r\ntaking a cup of milk or a little coffee and a biscuit or sandwich,\r\n_before raising the head from the pillow_ in the morning, remaining in\r\nbed about a quarter of an hour after this early meal; then dressing\r\nquickly, and immediately going out for a half-hour's walk. Rest in a\r\nhalf-recumbent posture during the day, particularly after meals, is\r\nbeneficial. The affection is mostly a nervous one, and is best combated\r\nby eating. The food should be plain and unirritating, but nutritious,\r\nand should be taken frequently, in small quantities at a time.\r\n\r\nWhen the nausea and vomiting are excessive, and continue during the day,\r\nthere is generally some disordered condition of the digestive apparatus.\r\n\r\nThis may be corrected by taking at night a tea-spoonful of the\r\nconfection of senna, a pleasant preparation of this ordinarily\r\ndisagreeable medicine, and by drinking three times a day, before each\r\nmeal, a wine-glassful of a tea made with columbo. Half an ounce of\r\npowdered columbo should be added, for this purpose, to a pint of boiling\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nDr. John H. Griscom of New York recommends the bromide of potassium,\r\nwhich is a harmless medicine for domestic practice, as affording the\r\nmost useful means of arresting the nausea attendant on pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe following prescription may be compounded by any druggist, and will\r\noften be found very effective:\r\n\r\n    Take of Bromide of Potassium, two drachms,\r\n            Cinnamon water, three fluid ounces.\r\n\r\nOf this a dessert spoonful may be taken two or three times a day. It may\r\nbe used with confidence as an entirely safe and harmless remedy in this\r\ntroublesome affection.\r\n\r\nA prescription frequently ordered for the nausea of pregnancy by the\r\nlate distinguished Dr. Meigs, consisted of equal parts of sweet tincture\r\nof rhubarb and compound tincture of gentian--a dessert spoonful to be\r\ntaken after meals.\r\n\r\n_Pain in the abdomen_, caused by the distension of its walls, may be\r\nrelieved by the application of equal parts of sweet oil and laudanum.\r\n\r\nAnother common and annoying, but rarely dangerous, trouble during\r\npregnancy is--\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOSE VEINS.\r\n\r\nThe veins of the legs become distended, knotted, and painful. Women who\r\nhave borne a number of children suffer most from this affection. It\r\nseldom attacks those passing through their first pregnancies. It\r\nordinarily first shows itself during the second pregnancy, and becomes\r\nrapidly worse during the third or fourth.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is difficult to cure this disease during the continuance of\r\nthe pregnancy, much can be done to prevent its occurrence, and to\r\nrelieve it when present. Tight garters worn below the knee, and closely\r\nlaced corsets, tend to cause and increase this swollen condition of the\r\nveins. Neither should be used during pregnancy.\r\n\r\nRelief is best afforded to the suffering parts by means of a well-made\r\nand adjusted _elastic stocking_, which may be readily procured from a\r\ndruggist or surgical instrument maker. In severe cases it may be\r\nnecessary for the patient to keep herself as much as possible in the\r\nrecumbent position on the bed or sofa. In all cases the feet should be\r\nsupported when seated, so as to keep the blood from further distending\r\nthe already swollen veins.\r\n\r\n\r\nPILES.\r\n\r\nThat painful condition of the veins of the lower bowel known as\r\nhæmorrhoids, or piles, is a not unfrequent annoyance to pregnant women.\r\nSometimes it is caused by prolonged constipation. During the period of\r\npregnancy, therefore, constipation should be guarded against.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the piles are small, and of little consequence beyond the\r\nslight uneasiness they occasion. The trifling loss of blood from them is\r\nof no account, and often beneficial. The case is different, however,\r\nwhen the piles are large and painful, and give rise to much pain and\r\ncopious bleeding. They then require prompt treatment.\r\n\r\nIn the _treatment_ of piles the first point to be aimed at is to keep\r\nthe bowels moderately open. It must not be forgotten, however, that\r\nduring pregnancy only the mildest of purgatives are ever to be given.\r\nCastor oil, although a disagreeable, is a most excellent prescription in\r\nthese cases. A small dose, repeated when necessary, will be found to\r\nact most kindly. If this remedy be too repugnant to the patient, small\r\nquantities of citrate of magnesia, or of cream of tartar, or of some of\r\nthe natural mineral waters, may be employed. Small injections of\r\nlukewarm water are also of great service, and may be tried instead of\r\nlaxatives.\r\n\r\nAfter every movement the parts should be well sponged with cold water,\r\nand an ointment of galls and opium, procured from the druggist, applied.\r\n\r\nIf the parts become very much inflamed, warm poultices or hot chamomile\r\nsolutions should be used, and the patient kept in bed until the\r\ninflammation subsides.\r\n\r\nNo attempt is to be made to effect the radical cure of piles during\r\npregnancy. Any such attempt, besides being dangerous, is unnecessary,\r\nfor the piles usually disappear of their own accord after the\r\nconfinement. Every effort to make the sufferer more comfortable in the\r\nmanner we have suggested is, however, right and safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRHOEA.\r\n\r\nSome women always suffer from looseness of the bowels during pregnancy;\r\nothers are very liable to attacks of it during this period, either\r\ncoming on without any assignable cause or easily excited by any slight\r\nindiscretion in eating. In many instances these attacks alternate with\r\nconstipation or with morning sickness.\r\n\r\nThe diarrhoea, if at all severe or prolonged, should not be allowed to go\r\non unchecked, for it quickly weakens the patient and predisposes her to\r\nabortion. The foetus is especially endangered when the passages are\r\nattended with much bearing-down pain. In some exceptional cases,\r\nhowever, a slight diarrhoea seems to be beneficial, for every attempt to\r\nremove it appears to do harm; but these instances are very rare.\r\n\r\nThe _treatment_ required is a simple, and must be a cautious one.\r\nOrdinarily no medicine will be needed. If the patient will merely\r\nconfine herself to milk and arrowroot and rice for twenty-four hours a\r\ncure will be effected in mild cases. When it is apparent that the attack\r\nhas been caused by improper food, a table-spoonful of castor-oil or a\r\ntea-spoonful or two of tincture of rhubarb will remove the offending\r\nmaterial in the bowels, upon the presence of which the diarrhoea depends.\r\nA small injection of a tea-spoonful of rice water and thirty or forty\r\ndrops of laudanum will often speedily arrest the excessive discharges,\r\nand relieve the pain.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTIPATION.\r\n\r\nNo woman while pregnant should allow several days to elapse without a\r\nmovement from the bowels. The symptoms of constipation, slight at the\r\noutset, soon cause great inconvenience. Among the effects, which, sooner\r\nor later, show themselves, may be feverishness, sleeplessness, headache,\r\ndistressing dreams, sickness at the stomach, severe bearing-down pains,\r\nand piles.\r\n\r\nMedicines are rarely required in the treatment of constipation, and the\r\npregnant woman should never take an active purgative, excepting under\r\nmedical advice. Outdoor exercise and regularity in soliciting nature's\r\ncalls, together with a change in the diet, will usually have the desired\r\neffect. Brown bread, wheaten grits, oatmeal gruel, ripe fruits, fresh\r\nvegetables, stewed prunes, or prunes soaked in olive oil, baked apples,\r\nfigs, tamarinds, honey, and currant jelly, are all laxative articles\r\nwhich should be tried.\r\n\r\nIn some instances a tumbler of cold water drunk the last thing at night,\r\nand another the first thing in the morning, will act in a most\r\nsatisfactory manner. If the constipation should resist these safe and\r\nhomely remedies, which will rarely be found the case, then medical\r\nassistance should be called in. On no account should the wife herself,\r\nor in accordance with the counsel of any non-medical friend, resort to\r\npurgative drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUGH.\r\n\r\nA troublesome cough sometimes affects delicate, nervous women during the\r\nearly months of pregnancy. If it be not very frequent nor severe, it\r\nrequires no attention, as it will pass away of itself in a short time.\r\nWhen, however, it disturbs the sleep at night, renders the patient\r\nanxious, and causes headache and weariness, it is time to do something\r\nfor it. It may, indeed, be so violent as to threaten abortion on account\r\nof the forcible concussion of the abdomen it produces.\r\n\r\nA tea-spoonful of paregoric occasionally repeated during the day will be\r\nfound a most efficient soothing remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAKEFULNESS.\r\n\r\nSleeplessness, always distressing, is particularly so to pregnant women.\r\nIf prolonged, it leads to serious consequences. It should receive,\r\ntherefore, the most prompt attention.\r\n\r\nThe _causes_ of sleeplessness during pregnancy are numerous. Dyspepsia\r\nis one of them. Whenever indigestion is present the diet should be plain\r\nand simple, and everything avoided which produces heartburn, sourness,\r\nor flatulency. It is important also not to take tea or coffee late in\r\nthe afternoon or evening--a late cup of either being a frequent cause in\r\nitself of sleeplessness.\r\n\r\nSometimes the reason for the wakefulness will be found in a want of\r\nexercise or too constant confinement to closely-heated rooms. Or, it may\r\nbe that exciting novels are read late in the evening. Perhaps the\r\nevening meal is too heavy and taken too late.\r\n\r\nThe _treatment_ of sleeplessness consists first, of course in the\r\nremoval of the apparent cause. The patient should have a regular hour\r\nfor retiring, which should be an early one. The bed-room should be\r\nquiet, well ventilated, and slightly warmed. The bed coverings must not\r\nbe too heavy nor the pillows too high.\r\n\r\nA warm bath of the temperature of 90 to 96 degrees Fahrenheit, taken\r\njust before going to bed, often invites sleep. A rapid sponging of the\r\nbody with warm water may have the same effect. A tumbler of cold water,\r\nwhen the skin is hot and dry, swallowed at bed-time, sometimes affords\r\nrelief. If the bowels are constipated relief should be sought in the\r\nmanner we have just mentioned in speaking of constipation.\r\n\r\nWhen there is nervous excitement at night, and the means we have advised\r\nfail to propitiate 'nature's soft nurse,' there is a sedative medicine\r\nwhich may be used with safety and effect--it is bromide of potassium.\r\nThe same proportion which we have given for the treatment of morning\r\nsickness (see page 355) may be now used. Have the three-ounce mixture\r\nput up by the druggist, and take a dessert-spoonful or a table-spoonful\r\njust before bed-time. It frequently acts almost as if by magic. On no\r\naccount should recourse be had to opiates or dangerous sedative drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF CHILDBED.\r\n\r\nChildbirth being a healthful physiological condition, is usually neither\r\nattended nor followed by mischievous results. Occasionally, however, the\r\nmother suffers in consequence of the prolonged or difficult character of\r\nher labor. The longer the labor the greater the danger to both mother\r\nand child. Thus childbirth pangs prolonged beyond twenty-four or\r\nthirty-six hours are much more apt to be attended with danger or\r\nfollowed by disease than those terminated within a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe following aphorisms were laid down by the late distinguished\r\nProfessor James Y. Simpson, namely:--\r\n\r\nThe mother is more liable to suffer under diseases of the womb after\r\nlong than after short labors. The child for some time after birth is\r\nmore liable to disease and death, in proportion as the labor has been\r\nlonger in its duration. First labors are longer in duration than\r\nsubsequent ones, and in a proportionate degree more complicated and\r\ndangerous to mother and child. Male births are longer in duration than\r\nfemale births, and in a proportionate degree more complicated and\r\ndangerous to mother and child.\r\n\r\nMany tedious confinements, however, are happily terminated without the\r\nslightest injury to mother or child. Whenever the labor has been\r\nunusually prolonged, unusual care and caution should be exercised in the\r\ntreatment of the mother and infant for many weeks after the event.\r\n\r\nOne of the most distressing affections to which women are exposed from\r\nchildbirth is\r\n\r\n\r\nPUERPERAL MANIA.\r\n\r\nThis is a variety of insanity which attacks some women shortly after\r\nchildbirth, or at the period of weaning a child. The period of attack is\r\nuncertain, as it may manifest itself first in a very few days, or not\r\nfor some months after the confinement. Its duration is likewise very\r\nvariable. In most instances a few weeks restore the patient to herself;\r\nbut there are many cases where judicious treatment for months is\r\nrequired, and there are a few where the mental alienation is permanent,\r\nand the wife and mother is never restored to her sanity.\r\n\r\nThe question has been much discussed, Whether such a condition is to be\r\nimputed to a hereditary tendency to insanity in the family, and also\r\nwhether a mother who has had such an attack is liable to transmit to\r\nher children, male or female, any greater liability to mental disease.\r\nWe are well aware what deep importance the answers to these inquiries\r\nhave to many a parent; and in forming our replies, we are guided not\r\nonly by our own experience, but by the recorded opinion of those members\r\nof our profession who have given the subject close and earnest\r\nattention. To the first query, the reply must be made that in one-half,\r\nor nearly one-half, of the cases of this variety of insanity there is\r\ntraceable a hereditary tendency to aberration of mind. Usually one or\r\nmore of the direct progenitors, or of the near relatives of the patient,\r\nwill be found to have manifested unmistakable marks of unsoundness of\r\nmind. In the remaining one-half cases no such tendency can be traced,\r\nand in these it must be presumed that the mania is a purely local and\r\ntemporary disorder of the brain. The incurable cases are usually found\r\nin the first class of patients, as we might naturally expect.\r\n\r\nThe likelihood of the children, in turn, inheriting any such\r\npredisposition, depends on the answer to the inquiry we first put. If\r\nthe mania itself is the appearance of a family malady, then the chances\r\nare that it will pass downward with other transmissible qualities. But\r\nif the mania arise from causes which are transitory, then there is no\r\nground for alarm.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry still more frequently put to the physician by the husband and\r\nby the patient herself after recovery, is, Whether an attack at one\r\nconfinement predisposes her to a similar attack at a subsequent similar\r\nperiod. There is considerable divergence of opinion on this point. Dr.\r\nGooch, an English physician of wide experience, is very strenuous in\r\ndenying any such increased likelihood, while an American obstetrician of\r\nnote is quite as positive in taking the opposite view. The truth of the\r\nmatter undoubtedly is, that where the mania is the exhibition of\r\nhereditary tendency, it is apt to recur; but where it arises from\r\ntransient causes, then it will only occur again if such causes exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTION.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, we perceive the importance of every woman, who has had,\r\nor who fears to have, one of these distressing experiences, being put on\r\nher guard against disregarding those rules of health the neglect of\r\nwhich may result so disastrously. One of the most powerful of these\r\ncauses is _exhaustion_. We mean this in its widest sense, mental or\r\nphysical. In those instances where mania appears at weaning, it is\r\ninvariably where the child has been nursed too long, or where the mother\r\nhas not had sufficient strength to nourish it without prostrating\r\nherself. It should be observed as a hygienic law, that no mother should\r\nnurse her children after she has had one attack of mania. The mere\r\nnervous excitement is altogether too much for her. She must once and for\r\never renounce this tender pleasure. We even go so far as to recommend\r\nthat no woman in whose family a mental taint is hereditary shall nurse\r\nher children.\r\n\r\nAnxiety, low spirits, unusual weakness from any cause, are powerful\r\npredisposing causes; and therefore in all cases, especially in those\r\nwhere the family or personal history leads one to fear such an attack,\r\nthey should be avoided. The diet should be nourishing and abundant, but\r\nnot stimulating. Cheerful society and surroundings should be courted,\r\nand indulgences in any single train of ideas avoided. As for directions\r\nduring the attack, they are unnecessary, as to combat it successfully\r\noften tasks the utmost skill of the physician; and it will be for him to\r\ngive these directions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE-FLOWING.\r\n\r\nThis affection, though not confined to married women, is quite common\r\nduring pregnancy and after confinement. There are few married women who\r\npass through their lives without at some time or other having suffered\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nWe will consider first that _form of white discharge which affects\r\npregnant women_. It ordinarily comes on during the latter half of\r\npregnancy. Not only does it occasion much inconvenience, but it may,\r\nwhen copious, seriously weaken the system and impair the health.\r\n\r\nThe best treatment consists in a regulated, but supporting, diet without\r\nstimulants, the avoidance of all marital relations, plenty of rest in\r\nbed or on a sofa, a warm hip bath every morning, and the use of\r\ninjections. One of the best injections for this purpose is made by\r\nadding a table-spoonful of lead-water to a pint of water, and injecting\r\nthe whole twice a day, by means of a rubber, hard-ball syringe. As this\r\nsolution will stain the body-linen, due precautions should be taken.\r\nInstead of this injection, a small tea-spoonful of alum dissolved in a\r\npint of water and injected once a day may be used.\r\n\r\nWe will now say a few words upon the _form of white-flowing which\r\naffects women after childbirth_. It is a common result of too frequent\r\nconfinements or of successive abortions. In women of a tendency to\r\nconsumption it has been observed that white-flowing is more apt to arise\r\nin connection with child-bearing. Prolonged nursing, resulting in great\r\ndebility of the mother, often produces very profuse white discharges.\r\n\r\nIn warm countries this affection is much more frequent than elsewhere.\r\nMoist and damp climates are said also to render women particularly prone\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThe _treatment_ must have regard to the general health of the patient.\r\nThe mode of life must be regulated. A change of scene, if it can be\r\nprocured, is often of the greatest benefit. Baths are also very useful.\r\nThey may be taken in the form of a 'sponge bath,' or 'hip bath.' If the\r\nformer be preferred, the patient should every morning, in a warm room,\r\nsponge the whole body, at first with tepid water and, after a time, with\r\ncold, the skin being well dried and rubbed with a coarse towel. The\r\nhip-bath may be employed either of simple, or of salt, or of medicated\r\nwater. It should be at first warm, and afterwards cold. The skin is to\r\nbe well rubbed after the hip as after the sponge-bath. The hip-bath may\r\nbe medicated with three or four table-spoonfuls of alum, or with a\r\nquarter of a pound of common household soda.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this treatment, injections should be employed in the\r\nmanner just directed for the white-flowing of pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILK-LEG.\r\n\r\nThis affection usually appears about ten days or two weeks after\r\nconfinement. The first symptoms which show themselves are general\r\nuneasiness, chills, headache, and a quickened pulse. Then pains in the\r\ngroin, extending down the thigh and leg of that side are complained of.\r\nSoon the whole limb becomes enlarged, hot, white, and shining.\r\nFeverishness and sleeplessness now naturally show themselves.\r\n\r\nThe disease rarely lasts more than two or three weeks, although the limb\r\nremains stiff, perhaps, for a number of weeks longer. It is painful, but\r\nnot dangerous--rarely proving fatal.\r\n\r\nWhen one leg is recovering, the disease sometimes attacks the other, and\r\nruns through the same course.\r\n\r\nThe treatment consists in enveloping the limb in turpentine stupes,\r\nfollowed by the application of poultices to the groin and a light diet\r\nat first. So soon as the severity of the attack is over, tonics and a\r\ngenerous diet should be given. The limb is then to be painted with\r\ntincture of iodine, or rather a mixture of one part of the tincture of\r\niodine with two parts of alcohol, and afterwards wrapped in a flannel\r\nbandage.\r\n\r\nThe term 'milk-leg' has been applied to this inflammation, for such it\r\nis, from the notion that in some way the milk was diverted from the\r\nbreasts to the limb causing the white swelling. It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to say this theory is entirely erroneous.\r\n\r\n\r\nINWARD WEAKNESS.\r\n\r\nMany, we may say most, married women whose health is broken down by some\r\ndisease peculiar to their sex, refer the commencement of their suffering\r\nto some confinement or premature birth. Perhaps, in four cases out of\r\nfive, this breaking down is one of the symptoms of a displacement of the\r\ninternal organs,--a malposition, in other words, of the uterus. This is\r\nfamiliarly known as an 'inward weakness;' and many a woman drags through\r\nyears of misery caused by a trouble of this sort.\r\n\r\nIt is true that these malpositions occur in unmarried women, and\r\noccasionally in young girls. But it is also true that their most\r\nfrequent causes are associated with the condition of maternity. The\r\nrelaxation of the ligaments or bands which hold the uterus in its place,\r\nwhich takes place during pregnancy and parturition, predisposes to such\r\ntroubles. It requires time and care for these ligaments to resume their\r\nnatural strength and elasticity after childbirth. Then, too, the walls\r\nof the abdomen are one of the supports provided by nature to keep all\r\nthe organs they contain in proper place by a constant elastic pressure.\r\nWhen, as in pregnancy, these walls are distended and put on the strain,\r\nsuddenly to be relaxed after confinement, the organs miss their support,\r\nand are liable to take positions which interfere with the performance of\r\ntheir natural functions. Therefore we may rightly place the greater\r\ntendency of married women to this class of diseases among the perils of\r\nmaternity.\r\n\r\nWithin the last fifteen years, probably no one branch of medical science\r\nhas received greater attention at the hands of physicians than this of\r\ndiseases of women. Many hitherto inexplicable cases of disease, much\r\nsuffering referred to other parts of the system, have been traced to\r\nlocal misfortunes of the character we have just described. Medical works\r\nare replete with cases of the highest interest illustrative of this. We\r\nare afraid to state some of the estimates which have been given of the\r\nnumber of women in this country who suffer from these maladies; nor do\r\nwe intend to give in detail the long train of symptoms which\r\ncharacterize them. Such a sad rehearsal would avail little or nothing to\r\nthe non-medical reader. It is enough to say, that the woman who finds\r\nherself afflicted by manifold aches and pains, without obvious cause;\r\nwho suffers with her head and her stomach and her nerves; who discovers\r\nthat, in spite of the precepts of religion and the efforts of will, she\r\nis becoming irritable, impatient, dissatisfied with her friends, her\r\nfamily, and herself; who is, in short, unable any longer to perceive\r\nanything of beauty and of pleasure in this world, and hardly anything to\r\nhope for in the next,--this woman, in all probability, is suffering from\r\na displacement or an ulceration of the uterus. Let this be relieved, and\r\nher sufferings are ended. Often a very simple procedure can do this. We\r\nrecall to mind a case described in touching language by a distinguished\r\nteacher of medicine. It is of an interesting young married lady, who\r\ncame from the Southern States to consult him on her condition. She could\r\nnot walk across the room without support, and was forced to wear, at\r\ngreat inconvenience to herself, an abdominal supporter. Her mind was\r\nconfused, and she was the victim of apparently causeless unpleasant\r\nsensations. She was convinced that she had been, and still was,\r\nderanged.\r\n\r\nThe physician could discover nothing wrong about her system other than a\r\nslight falling of the womb. This was easily relieved. She at once\r\nimproved in body and mind, soon was able to walk with ease and freedom,\r\nand once more enjoyed the pleasure of life. In a letter written soon\r\nafter her return home, she said, 'This beautiful world, which at one\r\ntime I could not look upon without disgust, has become once more a\r\nsource of delight.' How strongly do these deeply felt words reveal the\r\ndifference between her two conditions!\r\n\r\nThere is one source of great comfort in considering these afflictions.\r\nIt is, that they are in the great majority of cases traceable to\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES WHICH ARE AVOIDABLE.\r\n\r\nMost of them are the penalties inflicted by stern nature on infractions\r\nof her laws. Hence the great, the unspeakable, importance of women being\r\nmade aware of the dangers to which they are exposed, and being fully\r\ninformed how to avoid them. This task we now assume.\r\n\r\nThere is, we concede, a tendency in the changes which take place during\r\npregnancy and parturition to expose the system to such accidents. But\r\nthis tendency can be counteracted by care, and by the avoidance of\r\ncertain notorious and familiar infractions of the laws of health. It is\r\nusually not until she gets up and commences to go about the house, that\r\nthe woman feels any pain referable to a displaced womb. Very frequently\r\nthe origin of it is leaving the bed too soon, or attempting to do some\r\nwork, too much for her strength, shortly after a premature birth or a\r\nconfinement. Not only should a woman keep her bed, as a rule, for\r\nnineteen days after every abortion and every confinement, but for weeks\r\nafter she commences to move about she should avoid any severe muscular\r\nexertion, especially lifting, long walks, straining, or working on the\r\nsewing-machine. Straining at stool is one of the commonest causes. Many\r\nwomen have a tendency to constipation for weeks or months after\r\nchildbirth. They are aware that it is unfavorable to health, and they\r\nseek to aid nature by violent muscular effort. They cannot possibly do a\r\nmore unwise act. Necessarily the efforts they make press the womb\r\nforcibly down, and its ligaments being relaxed, it assumes either\r\nsuddenly on some one well-remembered occasion, or gradually after a\r\nsuccession of efforts, some unnatural position. The same reasoning\r\napplies to relieving the bladder, which is connected in some persons\r\nwith undue effort.\r\n\r\nConstipation, if present, must, and almost always can, be relieved by a\r\njudicious diet, and the moderate use of injections. These simple methods\r\nare much to be preferred to purgative medicines, which are rarely\r\nsatisfactory if they are continued for much time. When anything more is\r\nneeded, we recommend a glass of some laxative mineral water, which\r\nshould be taken before breakfast.\r\n\r\nFor the difficulty with the bladder we mentioned, diet is also\r\nefficacious. It is familiarly known that several popular articles of\r\nfood have a decided action in stimulating the kidneys: for instance,\r\nasparagus and water-melon. Such articles should be freely partaken, and\r\ntheir effect can be increased by some vegetable infusion, taken\r\nwarm,--as juniper-tea or broom-tea. The application to the parts of a\r\ncloth wrung out in water as hot as it can conveniently be borne, is also\r\na most excellent assistant to nature.\r\n\r\nSimilar strains on the muscles of the abdomen are consequent on violent\r\ncoughing and vomiting. Therefore these should be alleviated, as they\r\nalways can be, by some anodyne taken internally. Any medical man is\r\nfamiliar with many such preparations, so that it seems unnecessary to\r\ngive any formula, particularly as it would have to be altered, more or\r\nless, to suit any given case.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER CAUSES OF INWARD WEAKNESS.\r\n\r\nWomen of languid disposition and relaxed muscles are frequently urged to\r\n'take exercise,' and to 'go to work.' Their condition sometimes excites\r\ncensure rather than commiseration, because it is thought that they do\r\nnot exert, and thus strengthen, themselves as much as they should. We\r\nare quite as much in favour of work and vigorous muscles as any one. But\r\noften it were the most foolish advice possible to give a woman, to tell\r\nher to seek active exercise. It is just what she should avoid, as it may\r\nultimately give rise to that very trouble which, now only threatening,\r\nis the cause of her listlessness. Many instances are familiar to every\r\nphysician of extensive experience, where a long walk, a hard day's work,\r\na vigorous dance in the evening, or a horseback ride, has left behind it\r\na uterine weakness which has caused years of misery. Especially after\r\nconfinement or premature delivery it is prudent for a woman to avoid any\r\nsuch exertion for months and months. Moderate employment of her muscles\r\nin any light avocation, short walks and drives, fresh air, with\r\njudicious exercise,--these are well enough in every instance, but beyond\r\nthem there is danger. We know too well that advice like this will sound\r\nlike mockery to some who read these lines. They have to work, and work\r\nhard; they have no opportunity to spare themselves; the iron hand of\r\nnecessity is upon them, and they must obey. We can but sympathize with\r\nthem, and cheer them with the consolation that many a woman has borne\r\nall this and lived to a healthy and happy old age. Nature has surrounded\r\nthe infinitely delicate machinery of woman's organization with a\r\nthousand safeguards, but for all that, the delicacy remains; and it is\r\nbecause so many women are forced to neglect their duties to their\r\nownselves, that so many thousands walk the streets of our great cities,\r\nliving martyrs.\r\n\r\nBut no. We must modify what we have just written. In justice to our own\r\nsex, and in all truthfulness, we cannot allow the blame to be removed\r\naltogether from women themselves. They alone are responsible for one of\r\nthe most fruitful causes of their wretchedness. The theme is a\r\nthreadbare one. We approach it without hardly any hope that we shall do\r\ngood by repeated warnings utterly monotonous and tiresome. But still\r\nless can we feel comfortable in mind to pass it over in silence. We\r\nrefer to the foolish and injurious pressure which is exerted on the\r\nlower part of the chest and the abdomen by tight corsets, belts, and\r\nbands to support the under-clothing; in other words,\r\n\r\n\r\nTIGHT LACING.\r\n\r\nWhy it is, by what strange freak of fashion and blindness to artistic\r\nrules, women of the present day think that a deformed and\r\nill-proportioned waist is a requisite of beauty, we do not know.\r\nCertainly they never derived such an idea from a contemplation of those\r\nmonuments of perfect beauty bequeathed to posterity by the chisels of\r\nAttic artists, nor from those exquisite figures which lend to the canvas\r\nof Titian and Raphael such immortal fame. Look, for instance, at that\r\nwork of the former artist, now rendered so familiar by the\r\nchromo-lithographic process, called 'Titian's Daughter.' It is the\r\nportrait of a blonde-haired maiden holding aloft a trencher heaped with\r\nfruits. She turns her face to the beholder, leaning slightly backward to\r\nkeep her equilibrium. Her waist is encircled by a zone of pearls; and it\r\nis this waist we would have our readers observe with something more than\r\nan æsthetic eye. It is the waist of health as well as beauty. Narrower\r\nthan either the shoulders or the hips, it is yet anything than that\r\n'wasplike waist,' which is so fashionable a deformity. With such a\r\nwaist, a woman is fitted to pass through her married state with health\r\nand pleasure. There is little fear that she will be the tenant of\r\ndoctors' chairs, and the victim of drugs and instruments. Let women aim\r\nat beauty, let them regard it as a matter of very high importance, worth\r\nmoney and time and trouble, and we will applaud them to the echo. But\r\nlet them not mistake deformity, vicious shape, unnatural and injurious\r\nattitudes, and hurtful distortions for beauty. That not only degrades\r\ntheir physical nature, but it lowers their tastes, and places them in\r\næsthetics on a level with the Indian squaw who flattens her head and\r\nbores her nose, and with the Chinese woman who gilds her teeth, and\r\ncompresses her foot into a shapeless mass. True beauty is ever\r\nsynonymous with health; and the woman who, out of subservience to the\r\ndemands of fashion, for years squeezes her waist and flattens her\r\nbreast, will live to rue it when she becomes a mother. Away, then, with\r\ntight corsets and all similar contrivances.\r\n\r\nOf a similar objectionable character are many of the devices which\r\nignorant men connected with the medical profession urge upon the public\r\nfor the sake of remedying curvature of the spine, restoring the figure,\r\nor supporting the abdomen. Not a few of such braces and supporters are\r\nseriously dangerous. A good brace, well-fitting, carefully adjusted,\r\nsuited to the particular case, is often of excellent service; but the\r\nmajority of them do not answer this description. Our advice is, that no\r\ngirl, and still more no mother, should wear one of these without it is\r\nfitted upon her by an experienced hand. We have known more than one\r\ninstance where the binder put on after childbirth has been wrongly\r\nplaced, and pinned so firmly that it has resulted in producing falling\r\nof the womb. This, too, should be sedulously looked after.\r\n\r\nAll these are causes which are strictly under the control of the woman\r\nherself. They are therefore such as she should have in mind and be on\r\nher guard against. There are others, but they are less frequent, which\r\nare beyond her power; and it would be labor lost, therefore, for us to\r\nmention them.\r\n\r\nEqually vain would it be for us to speak of the various means by which\r\ndifficulties of this nature are removed. Probably no one branch of\r\nmedical surgery has been more assiduously cultivated than this; and the\r\nnumber of supporters, pessaries, braces, and levers which have been\r\nrecently brought before the medical profession for this purpose is\r\nsimply appalling. There are women and men who make it their business to\r\ncarry them through the country and sell them on commission. We\r\ndistinctly warn our readers against this class. They are almost\r\ninvariably ignorant and unscrupulous, rich in promises, and regardless\r\nof performances. She who patronizes them will be sure to lose her money,\r\nand will be lucky if she does not forfeit her health also.\r\n\r\nThe most we shall do is to give some advice how to treat such complaints\r\non principles of hygiene. And indeed this means nearly one-half the\r\nbattle. For without these simple cares, treatment of any kind is\r\nuseless, and sure to fail; and with them, many complaints are remedied\r\nas well as avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HYGIENIC TREATMENT OF INWARD WEAKNESS.\r\n\r\nThe first point we would urge is, that the woman who finds herself thus\r\nafflicted should seek to have such a position that she can _rest_. If\r\nshe is burdened with family cares, let her, if possible, diminish or\r\nescape them for a time. A rest of a month or two, not at a fashionable\r\nwatering-place, nor at a first-class hotel in some noisy city, but in\r\nquiet lodgings, or with some sympathizing friend, will be of great\r\nadvantage. This she should obtain without travelling too far. Prolonged\r\nmotion in railway carriages is in every instance injurious. If it must\r\nbe undertaken, for instance, in order to consult a qualified physician\r\nor to reach some friends, the modern appliances of comfort, such as\r\nair-cushions, foot-rests, and head-supports, should be provided. They\r\ncost but little, and to the invalid their value is great. No such\r\njourney should be undertaken at or near the time when the monthly\r\nillness might come on, as the suffering is always greater at these\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant associations which group themselves around a _happy home_\r\nare an important element in the treatment of diseases which, like these,\r\nare so intimately connected with the mind and nervous system. It will\r\nnot do heedlessly to throw such advantages away. When the home _is_\r\npleasant, and rest can there be had, the patient, in the majority of\r\ninstances, will do well to abide there. But when this is not the case,\r\nfor any reason, be it domestic infelicities, in which the husband has a\r\nshare,--be it disagreeable relatives, or importunate and tedious\r\nvisitors,--then the sooner such a mental weight is removed or avoided\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\nThe _diet_ is a very common subject of error. It is popularly supposed\r\nthat everybody who is weak should eat a 'strengthening' diet,--meat\r\nthree times a day,--eggs, ale, and beef-tea to any extent. This is a\r\ngreat error. Frequently such a diet has just the contrary effect from\r\nwhat is expected. The patient becomes dyspeptic, nervous, and more\r\ndebilitated than ever. The rule is, that only that diet is strengthening\r\nwhich is thoroughly digested, and taken up in the system. Frequently, we\r\nmay say in the majority of cases, a small amount of animal food,\r\nespecially game, fowls, fish, and soups, with fresh vegetables, and ripe\r\nfruits, will be far more invigorating than heavier foods. Pastry, cakes,\r\nand confectionery should be discarded, and great regularity in the hours\r\nof meals observed. Stimulants of all kinds are, as a rule, unnecessary,\r\nand highly spiced food is to be avoided. There is an old German proverb\r\nwhich says, 'Pepper helps a man on his horse, and a woman to her grave.'\r\nThis is much too strong; but we may avail ourselves, in this connection,\r\nof the grain of truth that it contains.\r\n\r\n_Cleanliness_, in its widest sense, is an important element in the\r\ntreatment. Not only should the whole surface of the body be thoroughly\r\nwashed several times a week, but the whole person should be _soaked_ by\r\nremaining in the water for an hour or more. This has an excellent\r\neffect, and is far from unpleasant. It was regarded in the days of\r\nancient Rome as such a delightful luxury, and such a necessity, indeed,\r\nthat every municipality erected public bathing establishments, with\r\nfurnaces to heat the water to such a temperature that persons could\r\nremain in it for several hours without inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe use of public baths is almost unknown in this country; but, in place\r\nof them, every modern house of even moderate pretensions has its own\r\nbath-room, so that the custom of cleanliness might appear to be hardly\r\nless general among all classes than in old Rome.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is, that so few people appreciate that to thoroughly\r\ncleanse the skin, still more for the bath to have a medicinal effect, it\r\nmust be prolonged far beyond the usual time we allow it. The European\r\nphysicians, who, as a rule, attach much greater importance to this than\r\nourselves, require their patients to remain immersed two, three, four,\r\nand occasionally even ten or twelve hours daily! This is said to have\r\nmost beneficial results; but who would attempt to introduce it in this\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\nLocal cleanliness is of equal importance. This is obtained by means\r\nof----\r\n\r\n\r\nINJECTIONS AND IRRIGATIONS\r\n\r\nof simple water, or of some infusion or solution. The use of the syringe\r\nas an article of essential service in preserving the health of married\r\nwomen should never be overlooked. Even when they are aware of no\r\ntendency to weakness or unusual discharge, it should be employed once or\r\ntwice a week; and when there is debility or disease of the parts\r\nactually present, it is often of the greatest service.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of female syringes now manufactured and sold,\r\nsome of which are quite worthless. Much the most convenient, cleanly,\r\nand efficient is the self-injecting india-rubber syringe, which is\r\nworked by means of a ball held in the hand, and which throws a constant\r\nand powerful stream. They come neatly packed in boxes, occupying small\r\nspace, and readily transported from place to place. Much depends on\r\nknowing how to apply them. The patient should be seated on the edge of a\r\nlow chair or stool with a hard seat, immediately over a basin. The tube\r\nshould then be introduced as far as possible without causing pain, and\r\nthe liquid should be thrown up for five or ten minutes. About one or two\r\nquarts may be used of a temperature, in ordinary cases, a little lower\r\nthan that of the apartment. Water actually cold is by no means to be\r\nrecommended, in spite of what some physicians say to the contrary. It\r\nunquestionably occasionally leads to those very evils which the\r\njudicious use of the syringe is intended to avoid.\r\n\r\nNo fluid but water should be used in ordinary cases. When, however,\r\nthere is much discharge, a pinch of powdered alum can be dissolved in\r\nthe water; and when there is an unpleasant odor present, a sufficient\r\namount of solution of permanganate of potash may be added to the water,\r\nto change it to a light pink color. This latter substance is most\r\nadmirable in removing all unpleasant odors; but it will stain the\r\nclothing, and must on that account be employed with caution.\r\n\r\nWe will add a few warnings to what we have just said about injections.\r\nThere are times when they should be omitted,--as for instance during the\r\nperiodical illness, when the body is either chilled or heated, and\r\ngenerally when their administration gives pain. There are also some\r\nwomen in whom the mouth of the womb remains open, especially those who\r\nhave borne many children. In such cases, the liquid used is liable to be\r\nthrown into the womb itself, and may give rise to serious troubles.\r\nThese should either omit the use of the syringe altogether, or obtain\r\none of those which throw the water backward and not forward. This\r\nvariety is manufactured and sold by various dealers.\r\n\r\n_Irrigations_ are more convenient in some respects than injections. They\r\nare administered in the following manner:--A jar holding about a gallon\r\nof water, simple or medicated, as may be advisable, is placed upon a\r\ntable or high stand. A long india-rubber tube is attached to the bottom\r\nof the jar, ending in a metallic tube, and furnished with a stopcock.\r\nThe patient seats herself on the edge of a chair over a basin,\r\nintroduces the tube, and turns the stopcock. The liquid is thus thrown\r\nup in a gentle, equable stream, without any exertion on her part. No\r\nassistant is required, and the force and amount of the liquid can be\r\nexactly graduated by elevating or lowering the jar, or by turning the\r\nstopcock. When there is much debility, or when it is desirable to apply\r\nthe liquid for a long time, this method is much preferable to syringing.\r\nThe necessary apparatus can readily be obtained in any large city. It\r\nhas, however, the drawback that the jar is large, and not convenient to\r\ncarry on journeys.\r\n\r\nWe shall close this chapter on Health in Marriage by a few words on some\r\nof the _ailments to which mothers are subject while nursing._\r\n\r\n\r\nGATHERED BREASTS.\r\n\r\nGathering of the breasts may occur at any time during the period of\r\nnursing, but it is most frequently met with within the first three\r\nmonths after childbirth, and is more common after the first than after\r\nsubsequent confinements. All women are more or less liable to it, but\r\nthose who are weakly, and particularly those who are scrofulous, are\r\nmost prone to its attacks.\r\n\r\nThe _causes_ of inflammation of the breast are numerous. It may be\r\ncreated by a blow or fall, by a cold, by mental excitement, by\r\nindiscretions in eating or drinking, and by moving the arms too much\r\nwhen the breasts are enlarged, but its most common cause is undue\r\naccumulation of milk in the breasts. Dr. Bedford is of the opinion that\r\nin nineteen cases out of twenty it is the result of carelessness--of\r\nneglect in not having the breasts properly drawn. 'For example, the\r\nchild may be delicate, and not able to extract the milk; or the nurse,\r\nin the gratification of some ancient prejudice derived from a remote\r\nancestry, does not think it proper to allow the infant to be put to the\r\nbreast for two or three days after its birth. In this way, the milk\r\nducts become greatly distended, inflammation ensues, which, if not\r\npromptly arrested, terminates in suppuration.'\r\n\r\nOften the love of pleasure brings with it this punishment to the nursing\r\nmother who neglects her maternal duties. During an evening spent in\r\nsociety or at the theatre the breasts cannot be relieved in the manner\r\nrequired for the preservation of their health.\r\n\r\nSoreness of the nipples, which renders suckling painful, often leads the\r\nmother to avoid putting the child to the breast as often as she should.\r\nIt is only when forced by the pain in the over-distended parts that she\r\ncan summon courage to permit of their being emptied. This partial and\r\nirregular nursing is very dangerous, and cannot fail, in most cases, to\r\nlead to the very painful affection of which we are now speaking.\r\n\r\nNo nursing mother is safe whose breasts are not properly and daily\r\nemptied. If this cannot be done by the child, another infant should be\r\napplied, or a small puppy, either of which expedients is preferable to a\r\nbreast-pump, which, however, is much better than neither. If the tender\r\nor chapped condition of the nipples interferes with free nursing, this\r\ncondition must be promptly remedied. When undue accumulation of milk is\r\nthreatened gentle friction of the breasts with sweet oil and camphor is\r\nalso of service; and they should be supported by means of a handkerchief\r\nplaced under them and tied over the shoulders.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, however, that though _gentle_ rubbing afford\r\nrelief to the breasts when they are hard, knotty, and over-distended,\r\nany friction is injurious if gathering has actually commenced. In all\r\ncases, therefore, it is of importance to distinguish between\r\nover-distension (which may _lead_ to inflammation) and a condition of\r\nalready established gathering of the breasts. This it is not difficult\r\nto do. In the former case the skin is pale, there is little or no\r\ntenderness, and the hardness is evenly diffused over the whole of the\r\nbreast; whereas, when gathering has taken place there is a blush of\r\nredness on some portion of the breast, which is always painful to the\r\ntouch, and which will be found to be particularly hard and sore in some\r\none spot.\r\n\r\nThe _symptoms_ of gathered breasts we have just described in part. The\r\nseverity of the symptoms will depend upon the extent and depth of the\r\ninflammation. The affection is always ushered in by shivering, followed\r\nby fever and a shooting pain in the breasts. A small, hard, painful\r\nswelling will be noticed in the breast even before the skin shows any\r\nsign of redness. This swelling increases in size and the suffering\r\nbecomes very great and difficult to bear, preventing sleep and\r\nprostrating the whole system. The secretion of milk is suspended at\r\nleast during the first active stage of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe object of _treatment_ is to prevent the formation of an abscess by\r\nsubduing the inflammation as speedily as possible. This is to be sought\r\nfirst by keeping the breast as nearly empty as possible. For this reason\r\nthe child should be assiduously applied to the affected rather than to\r\nthe well side, although suckling will be painful. Indeed, it is better,\r\nif it can be done, to procure an older child and let it keep the milk\r\nunder. When, however, the inflammation is fully established, the pain\r\nwill compel the restriction of the child to the well side. The\r\napplication of warmth is both grateful to the part and beneficial. This\r\nmay be done by means of poultices or fomentations, or by immersing a\r\nwooden bowl in hot water and putting the breast, wrapped in flannel,\r\nwithin it. This latter means will be found an easy and agreeable one of\r\nkeeping up the application of dry heat. The bowels should be briskly\r\npurged by a dose of citrate of magnesia or cream of tartar. The diet\r\nmust be mild, and the breasts supported in a sling. If, in spite of all\r\nthese efforts, an abscess actually forms, the attending physician will\r\ndoubtless advise its immediate opening, to which advice the patient\r\nshould accede, as that is the course which will afford her quicker and\r\nmore effectual relief than she can hope for from nature's unaided\r\nefforts at effecting a discharge of the pent-up matter.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting for the mother to know that if her child be\r\nstill-born, or if unfortunately she be unable from any of the reasons\r\nmentioned in our chapter on Hindrances to Nursing to give the breast at\r\nall to her child, she is not liable to gathering on this account. This\r\nis contrary to what might be expected. It is not the mother who is\r\nunable to nurse at all who suffers, but she who does so in an\r\nunsatisfactory manner and who fails to have her breasts properly\r\nemptied.\r\n\r\nThe first milk which makes its appearance in the breast towards recovery\r\nfrom inflammation is likely to be stringy and thick, and should,\r\ntherefore, be rejected before nursing is resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SINGLE LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few words, ere we pass to another branch of our subject, on the\r\nphysical relations of her who by choice or other reasons never marries.\r\nIt is a common observation among physicians who have devoted themselves\r\nto the study of woman's physical nature, that, in spite of those perils\r\nof maternity which we have taken no pains to conceal, the health of\r\nsingle women during the child-bearing period is, as a general rule, not\r\nbetter, not even so good, as that of their married sisters. Those\r\ninsurance companies who take female risks, do not ask any higher premium\r\nfor the married than the unmarried.\r\n\r\nVarious suggestions have been made to account for this unexpected fact.\r\nSome writers have pointed out that in many diseases marriage exerts a\r\ndecidedly curative influence, especially in chronic nervous ailments.\r\nChorea, for instance, or St. Vitus's dance, as it is popularly termed,\r\nhas been repeatedly cured by marriage. As a rule, painful menstruation,\r\nwhich always arises from some defect or disease of the ovaries or\r\nadjacent organs, is improved, and often completely removed, by\r\nthe same act. There are, as is well known, a whole series of\r\nemotional disorders,--hysteria, and various kinds of mania and\r\nhallucination,--which are almost exclusively confined to single persons,\r\nand only occur in the married under exceptional circumstances. An\r\ninstance has lately been detailed in the medical journals by a Prussian\r\nphysician, of a case of undoubted hereditary insanity which was greatly\r\nbenefited--indeed temporarily cured--by a fortunate nuptial relation. Few\r\nwho have watched a large circle of lady acquaintances but will have\r\nobserved that many of them increased in flesh and improved in health when\r\nthey had been married some months. An English writer of distinction\r\naccounts for these favourable results in a peculiar manner. Success, he\r\nsays, is always a tonic, and the best of tonics. Now, to women, marriage\r\nis a success. It is their aim in social life; and this accomplished,\r\nhealth and strength follow. We are not quite ready to subscribe to such a\r\nsweeping assertion, but no doubt it is applicable in a limited number of\r\ncases. Our own opinion is, that nature gave to each sex certain\r\nfunctions, and that the whole system is in better health when all parts\r\nand powers fulfil their destiny.\r\n\r\nCommon proverbs portray the character of the spinster as peevish,\r\nselfish, given to queer fancies, and unpleasant eccentricities. In many\r\na case we are glad to say this is untrue. Instances of noble devotion,\r\nbroad and generous sympathy, and distinguished self-sacrifice, are by no\r\nmeans rare in single women. But take the whole class, the popular\r\nopinion, as it often is, must be granted to be correct. Deprived of the\r\nnatural objects of interest, the sentiments are apt to fix themselves on\r\nparrots and poodles, or to be confined within the breast, and wither\r\nfor want of nourishment. Too often the history of those sisterhoods who\r\nassume vows of singleness in the interest of religion, presents to the\r\nphysician the sad spectacle of prolonged nervous maladies, and to the\r\nChristian that of a sickly sensibility.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we may answer a question not unfrequently put to the\r\nmedical attendant. Are those women who marry late in their sexual life\r\nmore apt to bear living children than the married of the same age; and\r\nare they more likely to prolong their child-bearing period by their\r\ndeferred nuptials? To both these inquiries we answer No. On the\r\ncontrary, the woman who marries a few years only before her change of\r\nlife, is almost sure to have no children who will survive. She is\r\ndecidedly less apt to have any than the woman of the same age who\r\nmarried young. If, therefore, love of children and a desire for\r\noffspring form, as they rightly should, one of the inducements to marry,\r\nlet not the act be postponed too long, or it will probably fail of any\r\nsuch result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGE OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a certain number of years, woman lays aside those functions with\r\nwhich she had been endowed for the perpetuation of the species, and\r\nresumes once more that exclusively individual life which had been hers\r\nwhen a child. The evening of her days approaches; and if she has\r\nobserved the precepts of wisdom, she may look forward to a long and\r\nplacid period of rest, blessed with health,--honored, yes, loved with a\r\npurer flame than any which she inspired in the bloom of youth and\r\nbeauty. Those who are familiar with the delightful memoirs of Madame\r\nSwetchine or Madame Recamier will not dispute even so bold an assertion\r\nas this.\r\n\r\nBut ere this haven of rest is reached, there is a crisis to pass which\r\nis ever the subject of anxious solicitude. Unscientific people, in their\r\nvivid language, call it _the change of life_; physicians know it as the\r\n_menopause_--the period of the cessation of the monthly flow. It is the\r\nepoch when the ovaries cease producing any more ova, and the woman\r\nbecomes therefore incapable of bearing any more children.\r\n\r\nThe age at which it occurs is very variable. In this country from\r\nforty-five to fifty is the most common. Instances are not at all\r\nunusual when it does not appear until the half century has been turned;\r\nand we have known instances where women past sixty still continued to\r\nhave their periodical illnesses.\r\n\r\nExamples of very early cessation are more rare. We do not remember to\r\nhave met any, in our experience, earlier than thirty years, but others\r\nhave observed healthy women as young as twenty-eight in whom the flow\r\nhad ceased.\r\n\r\nThe physical change which is most apparent at this time is the tendency\r\nto grow stout. The fat increases as the power of reproduction decreases.\r\nAnd here a curious observation comes in. We have said that when the girl\r\nchanges to a woman, a similar deposit of fat takes place (though less in\r\namount), which commences at the loins. This is the first sign of\r\npuberty. In the change of life the first sign is visible at the lower\r\npart of the back of the neck, on a level with the bones known as the two\r\nlowest cervical vertebræ. Here commences an accumulation of fat, which\r\noften grows to form two distinct prominences, and is an infallible index\r\nof the period of a woman's life.\r\n\r\nThe breasts do not partake of this increase, but become flat and hard,\r\nthe substance of the gland losing its spongy structure. The legs and\r\narms lose their roundness of outline, and, where they do not grow fat,\r\ndry up, and resemble those of the other sex. The abdomen enlarges, even\r\nto the extent occasionally of leading the wife to believe that she is to\r\nbe a mother,--a delusion sometimes strengthened by the absence of the\r\nmonthly sickness. Finally, a perceptible tendency to a beard at times\r\nmanifests itself, the voice grows harder, and the characteristics of the\r\nfemale sex become less and less distinct.\r\n\r\nSome who are more fortunate than their neighbours do not experience the\r\nleast discomfort at the change of life. They simply note that at the\r\nexpected time the illness does not appear, and for ever after they are\r\nfree from it. These are the exceptions. More commonly, marked\r\nalterations in the health accompany this important crisis, and call for\r\nsedulous hygienic care. It is gratifying to know that nearly all these\r\nthreatening affections can be avoided by such care, as they depend upon\r\ncauses under the control of the individual. Another fact, to which we\r\nhave already referred, is full of consolation. It is an unexpected\r\nfact--one that we should hardly credit, did it not rest on statistical\r\nevidence of the most indisputable character. The popular opinion, every\r\none knows, is, that the period of the change of life is one peculiarly\r\ndangerous to women. If this is so, we might expect that, if the number\r\nof deaths between the ages of forty and fifty years in the two sexes be\r\ncompared, we should find that those of females far exceed those of\r\nmales. This is, however, not the case. On the contrary, the deaths of\r\nthe males exceed in number those of the females.\r\n\r\nHasty readers may draw a false conclusion from this statement. They may\r\nat once infer that the change of life merits little or no attention, if\r\nit thus in nowise increases the bills of mortality. This would be a\r\nserious error. All intelligent physicians know that there are in very\r\nmany cases a most unpleasant train of symptoms which characterize this\r\nepoch in the physical life of woman. They are alarming, painful, often\r\nentailing sad consequences, though rarely fatal. All physicians are,\r\nhowever, not intelligent; and there are too many who are inclined to\r\nridicule such complaints, to impute them to fancy, and to think that\r\nthey have done their full duty when they tell the sufferer that such\r\nsensations are merely indicative of her age, and that in a year or two\r\nthey will all pass away. Such medical attendants do not appreciate the\r\ngravity of the sufferings they have been called to relieve. Says a\r\ndistinguished writer on the subject, after entering into some details in\r\nthe matter: 'I would not dwell on things apparently so trivial as these,\r\nhad I not seen some of the worst misery this world witnesses induced\r\nthereby.' Such a conviction should be in the mind of the physician, and\r\nlead him to attach their full weight to the vague, transitory, unstable,\r\nbut most distressing symptoms described to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\nWe shall speak of the various signs and symptoms which occur at and mark\r\nthe change; and in commencing so to do, we call attention to an\r\ninteresting illustration of the rhythm which controls the laws of life.\r\nAs in old age, when we draw near the last scene of all, we re-enter\r\nchildhood, and grow into second infancy, so the woman, finishing her\r\npilgrimage of sexual life, encounters the same landmarks and stations\r\nwhich greeted her when she first set out. She obeys at eve the voice of\r\nher own nature which she obeyed at prime. The same diseases and\r\ndisorders, the same nervous and mental sensations, the same pains and\r\nweaknesses which preceded the first appearance of her monthly illness,\r\nwill in all probability precede its cessation. Even those affections of\r\nthe skin or of the brain, as epilepsy, which were suffered in childhood,\r\nand which disappeared as soon as the periodical function was\r\nestablished, may be expected to reappear when the function has reached\r\nits natural termination. Therefore if a woman past the change notices\r\nthat she suffers from bleeding at the nose, headache, boils, or some\r\nskin disease, let her bethink herself whether it is not a repetition of\r\nsome similar trouble with which she was plagued before the eventful\r\nperiod which metamorphosed her from a girl into a woman.\r\n\r\nSo true is what we have just said, that in detailing the symptoms which\r\nfrequently occur at the change of life, we could turn back to the\r\nprevious pages where we discussed the dangers of puberty, and repeat\r\nmuch that we there said as of equal application here. For instance, the\r\ngreen-sickness, _chlorosis_, is by no means exclusively a disease of\r\ngirls. It may occur at any period of child-bearing life, but is much\r\nmore frequent at the _beginning_ and the _end_ of this term. Hardly any\r\none has watched women closely without having observed the peculiar tint\r\nof skin, the debility, the dislike of society, the change of temper, the\r\nfitful appetite, the paleness of the eye, and the other traits that show\r\nthe presence of such a condition of the nervous system in those about\r\nrenouncing their powers of reproduction. The precautions and rules which\r\nwe before laid down, can be read with equal profit in this connection.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these symptoms, which in a measure belong to the\r\nindividual's own history, there are others of a general character which\r\nbetoken the approaching change. One of them is an increasing\r\nirregularity in the monthly appearance. This is frequently accompanied\r\nwith a sinking sensation,--a 'feeling of goneness,' as the sufferer\r\nsays--at the pit of the stomach, often attended by flushes of heat,\r\ncommencing at the stomach and extending over the whole surface of the\r\nbody. The face, neck, and hands are suffused at inopportune moments, and\r\ngreatly to the annoyance of the sufferer. This is sometimes accompanied\r\nby a sense of fulness in the head, a giddiness, and dulness of the\r\nbrain, sometimes going so far as to cause an uncertainty in the step, a\r\nslowness of comprehension, and a feeling as if one might fall at any\r\nmoment in some sort of a fit.\r\n\r\nThis is not the worst of it. These physical troubles react upon the\r\nmind. An inward nervousness, intensely painful to bear, is very sure to\r\nbe developed. She fears she will be thought to have taken liquor, and to\r\nbe overcome with wine; she grows more confused, and imagines that she is\r\nwatched with suspicious and unkind eyes, and often she worries herself\r\nby such unfounded fancies into a most harassing state of mental\r\ndistress. Society loses its attractions, and solitude does but allow her\r\nopportunity to indulge to a still more injurious extent such brooding\r\nphantasms. Every ache and pain is magnified. Does her heart palpitate,\r\nas it is very apt to do? Straightway she is certain that she has some\r\nterrible disease of that organ, and that she will drop down dead some\r\nday in the street. Is one of her breasts somewhat sore, which, too, is\r\nnot unusual? She knows at once it is a cancer, and suffers an agony of\r\nterror from a cause wholly imaginary.\r\n\r\nVibrating between a distressing excitement and a gloomy depression, her\r\ntemper gives way; and even the words of the Divine Master lose their\r\ninfluence over her. She becomes fretful, and yet full of remorse for\r\nyielding to her peevishness; she seeks for sympathy, without being able\r\nto give reasons for needing it; she annoys those around her by\r\ngroundless fears, and is angered when they show their annoyance. In\r\nfine, she is utterly wretched, without any obvious cause of\r\nwretchedness.\r\n\r\nThis is a dark picture, but it is a true one--inexorably true. Let us\r\nhasten to add that such a mental condition is, however, neither a\r\nnecessary nor a frequent concomitant of the change. We depict it, so\r\nthat friends and relatives may better appreciate the sufferings of a\r\nclass too little understood, and so that women themselves, by knowing\r\nthe cause of such complaints, and the sad results which flow from them,\r\nmay make the more earnest efforts to avoid them.\r\n\r\nOther symptoms are, a sense of choking, a feeling of faintness, shooting\r\npains in the back and loins, creepings and chilliness, a feeling as if a\r\nhand were applied to the back or the cheek, a fidgety restlessness,\r\ninability to fix the mind on reading or in following a discourse, and a\r\nloss of control over the emotions, so that she is easily affected to\r\ntears or to laughter. All these merely indicate that nature is employing\r\nall her powers to bring about that mysterious transformation in the\r\neconomy by which she deprives the one sex for ever of partaking in the\r\ncreative act after a certain age, while she only diminishes the power of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS ON THE CHARACTER.\r\n\r\nThe effects on the character of this 'grand climacteric' are often\r\nmarked. Not unfrequently the woman becomes more masculine in thought and\r\nhabit, as has been admirably described by Dr. Tilt:--'There are almost\r\nalways while the change is progressing various forms of nervous\r\nirritability and some amount of confusion and bewilderment, which seem\r\nto deprive women of the mental endowments to which they had acquired a\r\ngood title by forty years' enjoyment. They often lose confidence in\r\nthemselves, are unable to manage domestic or other business, and are\r\nmore likely to be imposed on either within or without the family circle.\r\nWhen the change is effected, the mind emerges from the clouds in which\r\nit has seemed lost. Thankful that they have escaped from real\r\nsufferings, women cease to torture themselves with imaginary woes, and\r\nas they feel the ground grow steadier underfoot, they are less dependent\r\non others--for, like the body, the mental faculties then assume a\r\nmasculine character. The change of life does not give talents, but it\r\noften imparts a firmness of purpose to bring out effectively those that\r\nare possessed, whether it be to govern a household, to preside in a\r\ndrawing-room, or to thread and unravel political entanglements. When\r\nwomen are no longer hampered by a bodily infirmity periodically\r\nreturning, they have more time at their disposal, and for obvious\r\nreasons they are less subject to be led astray by a too ardent\r\nimagination, or by wild flights of passion.'\r\n\r\nChanges in the moral character also frequently show themselves, and for\r\na time astonish friends and relatives. These shades of moral insanity\r\nall disappear in a little while, if there be no family tendency to\r\ninsanity to prolong and intensify them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOSE WHO SUFFER MOST.\r\n\r\nThose women especially may anticipate serious trouble at this epoch in\r\nwhom the change at puberty was accompanied by distressful and obstinate\r\ndisorders,--those in whom the menstrual periods have usually been\r\nattended with considerable pain and prostration, and those in whose\r\nmarried life several abortions or several tedious and unnatural labors\r\nhave occurred; also those who from some temporary cause are reduced in\r\nhealth and strength,--as from repeated attacks of intermittent fever, or\r\ndisorders of the liver and digestive organs. Still more predisposed are\r\nthey who are subject to some of those displacements or local ulcerations\r\nwhich we have mentioned in our chapter on Health in Marriage. It becomes\r\nof great consequence, that any such deviation from the healthy standard\r\nshall be corrected before a woman reaches this trying passage in her\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nThe constitution and temperament have much to do with the liability to\r\ndisease and suffering during the change of life. Those of weak\r\nconstitutions sometimes fail of the necessary stamina to carry them\r\neasily through the trials of this transition period. It has been\r\nremarked that the _lymphatic_ temperament is the most favorable to an\r\neasy change. Women with this temperament suffer less from nervous or\r\nbilious disorders, and quickly show signs of having been benefited by\r\nwhat has occurred. Those of a _sanguine_ temperament are more liable to\r\nfloodings and to head symptoms; but such disorders with them usually\r\nreadily yield to treatment. The _bilious_ temperament predisposes to\r\ndisorders of the stomach and liver at this epoch; while the union of the\r\nnervous with the bilious temperament seems to predispose to mental\r\ndiseases. The most suffering at this time of life is experienced by\r\nwomen of a _nervous_ temperament.\r\n\r\nThe social position exerts an influence on the pain and the tendency to\r\ndisease at this epoch. The poor who are forced to labor beyond their\r\nstrength and who are exhausted by fatigue, anxiety, and want, suffer\r\nmuch. So also do those who have recently been exposed to some great\r\nsorrow. As the poet says:--\r\n\r\n    Danger, long travel, want, or woe,\r\n    Soon change the form that best we know----\r\n    For deadly fear can time out-go,\r\n        And blanch at once the hair.\r\n    Hard toil can roughen form and face,\r\n    And want can quell the eye's bright grace,\r\n    Nor does old age a wrinkle trace\r\n        More deeply than despair.\r\n\r\nThe occupations of women also have an influence upon the change of life.\r\nWasherwomen are said in particular to suffer more than others on account\r\nof the exposure to which they are subject by their trade. Those who are\r\nconfined many hours a day in close or damp rooms are unfavorably\r\nsituated for passing through the various stages of the 'grand\r\nclimacteric.' The rich, with plenty of time and means to care for\r\nthemselves, often blindly or obstinately create an atmosphere about them\r\nand follow a mode of life, quite as deleterious as the enforced\r\nsurroundings of their poorer sisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES AND DISCOMFORTS.\r\n\r\nIn rather more than one out of every four cases the change of life is\r\neither ushered in or accompanied by considerable flooding. When this\r\noccurs at the regular period, and is not in sufficient quantity to cause\r\ndebility, and is not associated with much pain, it need not give rise to\r\nany alarm. It is an effort of nature to relieve the impending plethora\r\nof the system, to drain away the excessive amount of blood which would\r\notherwise accumulate by the cessation of the flow. When it is remembered\r\nthat every month, for some thirty years of life, the woman of forty-five\r\nhas been moderately bled, we need not wonder that suddenly to break off\r\nthis long habit would bring about a plethora, which would in turn be the\r\nsource of manifold inconveniences to the whole system. Therefore this\r\nflooding may be regarded as a wise act of nature, and, as such, allowed\r\nto take its course so long as it is not attended with the symptoms\r\nmentioned above. When this is the case, however, the doctor should be\r\nconsulted, as then the bleeding may be from inflammation or ulceration,\r\nor even from that dreaded foe to life, cancer.\r\n\r\nInstead of finding this exit, the blood occasionally is thrown off by\r\nbleeding at the nose, or is spat up from the lungs, or is passed from\r\nbleeding piles. Due caution must be used about stopping such discharges\r\ntoo promptly. Rest, cool drinks, and the application of cold to the\r\nparts, are generally all that is needed.\r\n\r\nWe have just spoken of cancer. This is a subject of terror to many\r\nwomen, and their fears are often increased and deliberately played upon\r\nby base knaves who journey about the country calling themselves 'cancer\r\ndoctors,' and professing to have some secret remedy with which they work\r\ninfallible cures. It should be generally known that all such pretensions\r\nare false. It is often a matter of no little difficulty, requiring an\r\nexperienced eye, to pronounce positively whether a tumour or ulcer is\r\ncancerous. These charlatans have no such ability; but they pronounce\r\nevery sore they see a cancer, and all their pretended cures are of\r\ninnocent, non-malignant disorders. Cancers are more apt to develope\r\nthemselves at this period. Their seat is most frequently in the womb or\r\nthe breast, and they are said to be especially liable to arise in those\r\nwomen who have suffered several abortions or unnatural labours.\r\nUndoubtedly they are more frequent in the married than the unmarried,\r\nand they evidently bear some relation to the amount of disturbance which\r\nthe system has suffered during childbirth, and the grief and mental pain\r\nexperienced. For this reason a celebrated teacher of obstetrics insists\r\nupon classing them among nervous diseases. The surgeon alone can cure\r\nthem, and he but rarely. Medicine is of no avail, however long and\r\npainstaking have been its searches in this direction. A touching story\r\nis related in this connection of Raymond Sully, the celebrated\r\nphilosopher. When a young man, he was deeply impressed with the beauty\r\nof a lady, and repeatedly urged his suit, which she as persistently\r\nrepelled, though it was evident she loved him. One day, when he insisted\r\nwith more than usual fervor that she should explain her mysterious\r\nhesitation, she drew aside the folds of her dress and exposed her\r\nbreast, partly destroyed by a cancer. Shocked and horrified, but unmoved\r\nin his affection, he rushed to the physicians and demanded their aid.\r\nThey replied they could give none. He determined to find a cure, if he\r\nhad to seek in all parts of the earth. He visited the learned doctors of\r\nAfrica and Asia, and learned many wonderful things--even, it was said,\r\nthe composition of the philosopher's stone itself; but what he did not\r\nfind, and what has never yet been found, was what he went forth to\r\nseek--a cure for cancer.\r\n\r\nAt this time, too, tumors or swellings of the ovaries are apt to\r\ncommence. They are nearly always preceded by scanty or painful\r\nmenstruation; and this, therefore, it is the duty of every woman, as she\r\nvalues the preservation of her future health, to remedy by every means\r\nin her power.\r\n\r\nGenerally, from the commencement of the change of life commences also a\r\nsteady diminution of the sexual passions, and soon after this period\r\nthey quite disappear. Sometimes, however, the reverse takes place, and\r\nthe sensations increase in intensity, occasionally exceeding what they\r\neven were before. This should be regarded with alarm. It is contrary to\r\nthe design of nature, and can but mean that something is wrong.\r\nDeep-seated disease of the uterus or ovaries is likely to be present, or\r\nan unnatural nervous excitability is there, which, if indulged, will\r\nbring about dangerous consequences. Gratification, therefore, should be\r\ntemperate, and at rare intervals, or wholly denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRECAUTIONS AND REMEDIES.\r\n\r\nTo guard against the dangers of this epoch, those general rules of\r\nhealth which we have throughout insisted upon should be rigidly\r\nobserved. If during the whole of her sexual life the woman has been\r\ndiligent in observing the laws of health, she has little to fear at this\r\nperiod. Some simple remedies will suffice to allay the disagreeable\r\nsymptoms; and the knowledge that most of them are temporary, common to\r\nher sex, and not significant of any peculiar malady, will aid her in\r\nopposing their attacks on her peace of mind. When plethora, flooding,\r\nor congestion is apparent, the food should be light, chiefly vegetable,\r\nand moderate in quantity. Liquors, wines, strong tea, coffee, and\r\nchocolate should be avoided; an occasional purgative or a glass of some\r\nlaxative mineral water should be taken, and cool bathing regularly\r\nobserved. Exercise should be indulged in with caution, and care taken to\r\navoid excitement, severe mental or bodily effort, and exhaustion. If the\r\nsystem is debilitated, and the danger is rather from a want of blood\r\nthan too much blood, nourishing food, tonic medicines, and perhaps some\r\nstimulant, are called for. When the perspiration is excessive, flannel\r\nshould be worn next the skin in the daytime, and a flannel night-dress\r\nat night. A tepid bath before retiring is also useful. The 'goneness'\r\nand other unpleasant sensations referred to the pit of the stomach may\r\nbe much relieved by wearing a well-made spice-plaster over the stomach,\r\nor binding there a bag of gum camphor; or if these fail, an opium\r\nplaster will hardly fail to be of service. Internally, we think, nothing\r\nat all is needed; but as something must be taken, let it not be spirits\r\nor wine, but half a tea-spoonful of aromatic spirits of ammonia in a few\r\ntable-spoonfuls of water. There is too much of a tendency among some\r\nwomen to seek alleviation in intoxicating compounds, 'bitters,'\r\n'tonics,' and so forth, at such times. They can only result in injury,\r\nand should be shunned. The pains in the back and loins often\r\nexperienced, can generally be removed by rubbing the parts with hot\r\nmustard-water and taking a gentle purgative, or by placing against the\r\nlower part of the spine a hot brick wrapped in a flannel cloth wrung\r\nout in warm water or laudanum and water.\r\n\r\nOnce safely through this critical period, the woman has a better chance\r\nfor long life and a green old age than the man of equal years. Tables of\r\nhuman life show this conclusively. With the sweet consciousness of duty\r\nperformed, she is now prepared to assist others by intelligent advice,\r\ncheerful counsel, and tender offices; she can now surround herself with\r\nthat saintly halo of kind words and good works which wins a worthier\r\nlove than passion offers; and, passing onward to the silence of eternal\r\nrest, she will leave in the memory of all who knew her, pleasant\r\nimpressions and affectionate reminiscences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. 20.

Twiner, in the _Richmond\r\nand Louisville Medical Journal_, March, 1869, Raciborski, _De la\r\nMenstruation et de l'Age Critique chez la Femme_, p. 130. The quotation\r\n(p. 26) is from Dr. Edward Smith, _Cyclical Changes in Health and\r\nDisease_,--a profound work. Raciborski is the principal authority for\r\nthis and the following section. Our own inquiries fully confirm his\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\nP. 32. INFLUENCE OF THE MOON ON MENSTRUATION.--On this question, see the\r\nresearches of M. Parchappe, _Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences_,\r\ntom. xvi. p. 550. See also Dr. Shrye, _Tractatus de Fluxu Menstruo_, in\r\nthe _Acta Lipsiensia_ for 1686, p. 111; Dr. W. Charleton, _Inquisitio\r\nPhysica de Causis Catameniorum_, p. 78; and Galen, _De Diebus\r\nDecretoriis_, lib. iii., for other curious particulars.\r\n\r\nP. 37. CHLOROSIS.--For the pathology of this disease, see Dr. Gaillard\r\nThomas, _Diseases of Women_, p. 625, and Dr. C. H. Bauer, in the\r\n_Weiner Medicin. Zeitung_, No. 33, 1868. Occasionally the change at\r\npuberty leads to an affection very closely resembling typhoid fever, but\r\nwhich is strictly due to the sexual crisis; and often goitre commences\r\nat this period. See a review of Raciborski, in the _Bulletin de\r\nTherapeutique_, June, 1869.\r\n\r\nP. 39. MASTURBATION IN GIRLS.--See Miss Catherine E. Beecher, _Letters\r\nto the People on Health and Happiness_, p. 159. The late medical\r\nliterature on the subject is abundant. See _Ueber die Behandlung der\r\nMasturbation bei kleinen Mädchen, Journal jür Kinderkrankheiten_, Bd.\r\nli. p. 360; H. R. Storer, _Western Journal of Medicine_, July, 1868; and\r\n_Journal of the Gynecological Society_, vol. i. No. 1.\r\n\r\nPp. 50, 51. PREMATURE MARRIAGES.--See Dr. Duncan, _Fecundity,\r\nFertility_, etc., p. 241; Reich, _Natur und Gesundheitslehre des\r\nEhelichen Lebens_, p. 518.\r\n\r\nP. 56. HOLY LOVE.--The distinction between [Greek: haghapê] and [Greek:\r\nirhôhê] is too familiar to all scholars to need extended mention. See\r\nTrench, _Synonyms of the New Testament, sub voce._\r\n\r\nPp. 57, 58. SINGLE LIFE IN ITS RELATION TO SANITY AND MORTALITY.--The\r\nextraordinary statements in the text are vouched for by Dr. Casper,\r\n_Medicinische Statistik_, vol. ii. p. 164, and Dr. Reich, _Geschichte,\r\nNatur, und Gesundheitslehre des Ehelichen Lebens_, pp. 510, 511. We have\r\ncompared the reports of a number of asylums for the insane, and find the\r\nproportions very nearly as great as stated by these authorities.\r\n\r\nP. 70. INTERMARRIAGE OF RELATIVES.--The view we advocate on this point,\r\nwe know, is neither the received nor the popular one. In the middle ages\r\nit was forbidden to intermarry within the seventh degree of\r\nconsanguinity; but this and all other regulations were based on\r\ntheological and political, not physiological, grounds. Among others, Dr.\r\nNathan Allen has insisted on the danger of consanguineous marriages\r\n(_Journal of Psychological Medicine_, Volume ii). But other very careful\r\nand recent students adopt the view of our text: for instance, Dr. F. J.\r\nBehrend, _Journal für Kinderkrankheiten_, December, 1868, p. 316; Dr. A.\r\nVoisin, in the reports of the _Paris Académie de Médecin_,1864, 1865,\r\nand 1868; and Dr. H. Gaillard, in the last edition (1868) of the\r\n_Dictionnaire de Médecine et de Chirurgie Pratique_. All the statements\r\nin the text are supported with incontrovertible evidence by these\r\nwriters. If we are asked how to meet the seemingly alarming array of\r\nallegations by Dr. Bemiss, the Kentucky physician referred to in the\r\n_Transactions of the American Medical Association_ for 1859, we would\r\nrefer to Dr. Behrend's articles, where the researches of Bemiss are\r\nseverely criticised. For Dr. Edward Smith's assertion, see his _Essay on\r\nConsumption_, p. 244 (Philadelphia, 1865).\r\n\r\nP. 80. COMMUNICATION OF VENEREAL DISEASES.--Many instances are recorded\r\nwhere a drinking-glass, a spoon, a fork, or a handkerchief has infected\r\ninnocent persons with these terrible diseases (see Cullerier, _Atlas of\r\nVenereal Diseases_, p. 43). They are communicated from the male to the\r\nfemale, or from the female to the male, with equal facility, and either\r\nparent can transmit them to the children. The physician referred to is\r\nDr. Sigmund, in the _Humboldt Medical Archives_, 1868.\r\n\r\nP. 83. SYMBOLISM.--See Dr. Carus, _Symbolik der Menschlichen Gestalt_,\r\nthe most scientific work ever written on physiognomy, phrenology, and\r\nallied subjects.\r\n\r\nPp. 90, 91.--See Raciborski, _De la Puberté et de l'Age Critique chez la\r\nFemme_, p. 133; Tilt, _Uterine Therapeutics_, p. 315.\r\n\r\nP. 94. CONTAGION OF PHTHISIS.--See Dr. William A. Hammond's _Treatise on\r\nHygiene_, p. 438, for air-space required by a healthy person. The\r\ncontagion of phthisis is maintained by many authorities--among others,\r\nDr. W. W. Gerbard (see Pennsylvanian Hospital Reports for 1868, p.\r\n266). Professor Castan has recently collected, in the _Montpelier\r\nMédicale_, a variety of facts, which seem to show that tuberculosis may\r\nbe communicated from a diseased to a healthy person by transpiration,\r\nbreathed air, and living together (_Press and Circular_, March 10,\r\n1869). In regard to the inoculation of tubercle, we have reference to\r\nthe well-known experiments of M. Villemin, of the Hôpital Val-de-Grace,\r\nParis. In this connection we may record an instance of recent medical\r\nheroism. M. Lespiaud, attached to the surgical department of the\r\nVal-de-Grace, in presence of several of his colleagues, extracted\r\ngranular matter from the body of a phthisical subject, and introduced it\r\nunder his own integument. This zealous investigator into the etiology of\r\ntuberculosis has thus exposed himself in a courageous way for the\r\nbenefit of science, to the effects of a most dangerous and merciless\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nP. 96. THE DIGNITY AND PROPRIETY OF THE SEXUAL INSTINCT.--Dr. Edward\r\nJohn Tilt is the medical writer referred to (see _Uterine Therapeutics_,\r\npp. 95, 313). See also Bosquet, _Noveau Tableau de l'Amour Conjugal_,\r\nvol. ii. p. 2, etc.; Rousel, _Système Physique et Moral de la Femme_, p.\r\n211; Menville, _Histoire Médicale et Philosophique de la Femme_, vol. i.\r\np. 36 et seq.; Raciborski, _De la Puberté_, etc., p. 45.\r\n\r\nP. 99. ON THE INDULGENCE AND RESTRAINT OF SEXUAL DESIRE.--Menville, vol.\r\nii. p. 91; Bosquet, vol. ii. p. 280; _Economy of Life--or, Food, Repose,\r\nand Love_, by George Miles. Dr. Edward Smith, in his valuable work on\r\n_Cyclical Changes in Health and Disease_, has collected extensive\r\nstatistics showing the effect of the time of conception on the viability\r\nof the foetus. The quotation is from Carpenter's _Human Physiology_, p.\r\n753.\r\n\r\nP 103. See _Lancet_ for March 6, 1869, p. 337, for report of discussion\r\nin the Pathological Society of London upon the physical degeneracy\r\nresulting from procreation during intoxication. Authorities could be\r\ncited at length upon this subject, but it is not necessary. See\r\nHuleland's _Art of Prolonging Life_, p. 207.\r\n\r\nPp. 106-114. STERILITY.--For statistics referred to, see Dr. Matthews\r\nDuncan, _Fecundity, Fertility, and Sterility_ (Edinburgh, 1866), p. 181\r\n_et seq._; Dr. Tilt, _Uterine Therapeutics_, p. 291; Dr. Edward Reich,\r\n_Gesundheitslehre des Ehelichen Lebens_, Th. ii.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Marion Sims, _On the Microscope as an Aid in the Diagnosis and\r\nTreatment of Sterility_, _New York Medical Journal_, January 1869, p.\r\n406; Charles Darwin, _The Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication_, vol. ii. p. 198; _Philadelphia Medical and Surgical\r\nReporter_, November 2, 1867, p. 384; A. Debay, _Hygiène et Physiologie\r\ndu Mariage_, p. 288 (Paris, Quarante-quatrième édition); Raciborski, _De\r\nla Puberté_, etc., p. 451; Virey, _De la Femme sous ses Rapports Phys._,\r\netc., p. 332; Dr. Gunning S. Bedford, _The Principles and Practice of\r\nObstetrics_, p. 107.\r\n\r\nP. 115. THE LIMITATION OF OFFSPRING.--We have taken great pains to avoid\r\ngiving false or dangerous impressions in this section. The references in\r\nthe order of quotation are:--Dr. Tilt, _Hand-Book of Uterine\r\nTherapeutics_, p. 317; Dr. Duncan, _Fecundity, Fertility, Sterility, and\r\nAllied Topics_, pp. 289, 290; Dr. Hillier, _Diseases of Children_, p.\r\n114; John Stuart Mill, _Principles of Political Economy_, p. 591; Dr.\r\nDrysdale, _London Medical Press and Circular_, December, 1868, p. 478;\r\nRaciborski, _De l'Age Critique chez la Femme_, p. 484; _The Nation_,\r\nJune 1869; Dr. Edward Reich, _Natur und Gesundheitslehre des Ehelichen\r\nLebens_, p. 493; _Boston Medical and Surgical Journal_, February 1867;\r\n_Philadelphia Medical and Surgical Reporter_, vol. xix. p. 305;\r\nSismondi, _Principles of Political Economy_, book vii. chap. v.; Dr.\r\nMacCormac, in _London Medical Press and Circular_, March 1869, p. 244;\r\nDr. Gaillard Thomas, _Diseases of Women_, p. 58; _Leavenworth Medical\r\nHerald_, April, 1867; Dr. N. K. Bowling, in _The Nashville Journal of\r\nMedicine and Surgery_, October 1868. We have rather let others speak\r\nthan spoken ourselves, and have collected the opinions of many most\r\ndistinguished physicians and statesmen, who thus pronounce against\r\nexcessive child-bearing. Any intelligent physician will acknowledge the\r\nweight to be assigned to such names.\r\n\r\nP. 128. SIGNS OF FRUITFUL CONJUNCTION.--Carpenter, _Human Physiology_,\r\np. 772; Dr. Gunning S.

MOTHERS' MARKS.--See a very interesting article by Professor Wm.\r\nA. Hammond, in _The Quarterly Journal of Psychological Medicine and\r\nMedical Jurisprudence_, January, 1868, p. 1, in which he says, in\r\nregard to the influence of the maternal mind over the foetus _in utero_:\r\n'The chances of these instances, and others which I have mentioned,\r\nbeing due to coincidence, are infinitesimally small; and though I am\r\ncareful not to reason upon the principle of _post hoc ergo propter hoc_,\r\nI cannot--nor do I think any other person can, no matter how logical may\r\nbe his mind--reason fairly against the connection between cause and\r\neffect in such cases. The correctness of the facts only can be\r\nquestioned: if these be accepted, the probabilities are thousands of\r\nmillions to one, that the relation between the phenomena is correct.'\r\nSee also Dr. J.

Every\r\nmother should have this book, nor should she suffer a child to be\r\nmarried without the knowledge which this work contains. Thousands have\r\ndragged through miserable lives and many have perished for want of such\r\nknowledge. It is to be hoped, too, now that these delicate topics have\r\nbeen so modestly and plainly treated, that your work will supersede the\r\nscores of ill-considered and often mischievous treatises addressed \"to\r\nthe married,\" which too often serve the lusts of men under the pretence\r\nof virtue.\r\n\r\nHENRY WARD BEECHER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM REV.

I\r\ncongratulate you on the felicitous manner in which you have treated so\r\ndifficult a subject, and would recommend it to the public as supplying a\r\nwant that has long been felt in this country.\r\n\r\n_Omne verum utile dictu_, and what can be more proper or more useful\r\nthan that woman should be made acquainted with the great laws of her\r\nbeing and the duties for which she was created?\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obed't servant,\r\n\r\nHARVEY L. BYRD.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER RECEIVED FROM EDWIN M. SNOW, M.D., OF PROVIDENCE,\r\nRHODE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nPROVIDENCE, Sept. 1869.\r\n\r\nDR. NAPHEYS--\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_: I have examined with much interest the advance sheets of\r\nyour book, \"The Physical Life of Woman:\" I am highly pleased with it.\r\nThe advice given seems to me to be generally correct, and judiciously\r\nexpressed; and, in my opinion, the wide circulation of the book would be\r\na benefit to the community,\r\n\r\nTruly yours,\r\n\r\nEDWIN M. SNOW.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM REV. GEORGE ALEX. CROOKE, D.D., D.C.L.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Sept. 1869.\r\nDR. GEO. H. NAPHEYS--\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_: I have carefully read your work entitled \"The Physical Life\r\nof Woman,\" and, as the result, I must candidly say that I believe the\r\ninformation it contains is well calculated to lessen suffering and\r\ngreatly benefit the human race. I know there are some falsely fastidious\r\npersons who would object to any work of the kind, but \"to the pure all\r\nthings are pure.\" You have done your part fearlessly and well, and in a\r\npopular manner, and I trust that your work may be productive of all the\r\ngood you design by its publication.\r\n\r\nVery faithfully,\r\nGEO. ALEX. CROOKE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOPINION OF LLOYD P. SMITH, Esq.\r\n\r\nLibrarian Philadelphia Library.\r\n\r\nLIBRARY CO. OF PHILADELPHIA, FIFTH ST. BEL. CHESTNUT, PHILADELPHIA,\r\nSept. 1869.\r\n\r\nIt is an open question whether books de _secretis mulierum_ should be\r\nwritten for the general public; but there is no doubt that, when they\r\nare written, it should be done by the regular faculty, and not by\r\nignorant quacks. Dr. Napheys' \"Physical Life of Woman\" shows not only\r\nthe scientific attainments of the author, but also a wide range of\r\nmiscellaneous reading. The delicate subjects treated of are handled with\r\na seriousness and earnestness becoming their importance, and the\r\nauthor's views are expressed in excellent English.\r\n\r\nLLOYD P. SMITH.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOPINION OF S. W. BUTLER, M.D.\r\n\r\nEditor of the Philadelphia \"Medical and Surgical Reporter.\"\r\n\r\nI have carefully examined \"The Physical Life of Woman,\" and find it a\r\nwork at once thoroughly representing modern science, and eminently\r\nadapted for family instruction. It is well suited to female readers, to\r\nwhom it is especially addressed both in the matter it contains and in\r\nthe delicacy with which points relating to their physiological life are\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nS. W. BUTLER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER RECEIVED FROM JOHN H. GRISCOM, M.D.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, Sept. 1869.\r\nDR NAPHEYS--\r\n\r\n_My Dear Sir_: The \"Physical Life of Woman\" is a very scientific and\r\nintellectually written work, and contains almost all the physiological\r\nand sanitary facts and directions needed for the preservation of the\r\nhealth and longevity of the maiden, wife, and mother. It must prove\r\nattractive and useful for any lady who reads it.\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend,\r\nJOHN H. GRISCOM.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM THE NATIONAL BAPTIST, PHILA., DEC. 30, 1869\r\n\r\nWe join in the cordial welcome which this book has received. There is no\r\nother work which tells so well just what every woman--and every\r\nconsiderate man also--ought to know. Maternity is the one great function\r\nof woman, according to God's ordinance, and for this marvelous and holy\r\nmission her physical, intellectual, and moral constitution has been\r\ndesigned. Dr. Napheys, in his wise \"Advice to maiden, wife, and mother,\"\r\npasses in review the cardinal facts respecting woman's physical life.\r\nThe book is written in a very clear and simple style, so that no one can\r\nmisunderstand it, while there is nothing to disturb or offend the most\r\nsensitive. A judicious mother would do her maturing daughters great\r\nservice by first carefully reading this volume herself, and then have\r\nthem read it under her guidance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOPINION OF MRS. R. B. GLEASON, M.D.\r\n\r\nELMIRA, N. Y., Sept. 1869.\r\n\r\nThe advance sheets of \"The Physical Life of Woman\" have been read with\r\nmuch interest. In this book Dr. Napheys has well met a real need of the\r\nage. There are many things incident to woman's physical organization\r\nwhich she needs to know, and concerning which she still does not want to\r\nask a physician, and may not have one at hand when she most desires the\r\ninformation. This book can be easily read and perfectly understood by\r\nthose not familiar with medical terms. All matters of delicacy are\r\ntreated with freedom, and still with a purity of thought and expression\r\nwhich is above criticism.\r\n\r\nFor many years we have been often asked for just such a book, and shall\r\ngladly commend it to the many wives and mothers who want for themselves\r\nand grown-up daughters such a book of helps and hints for home life.\r\n\r\nMRS. R. B. GLEASON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM PROFESSOR JOHN S. HART, LL.D.\r\n\r\nSTATE NORMAL SCHOOL, TRENTON, N. J.\r\nGEO. H. NAPHEYS, M.D.--\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_: I have read with attention the advance sheets of your book,\r\n\"The Physical Life of Woman:\" and take pleasure in saying that you have\r\nhandled a most difficult and important subject with equal delicacy and\r\nability.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nJOHN S. HART.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOPINION OF MARK HOPKINS, D.D., LL.D.,\r\n\r\nPresident of Williams College.\r\n\r\n\"Your book is conscientiously written, and will be likely to do good.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM THE N. Y. EVANGELIST, NOV. 18, 1869.\r\n\r\nThis is a plain and practical treatise, prepared by a physician of skill\r\nand experience, in which he aims to furnish information to women, in\r\ntheir peculiar conditions and relations, married and single, so as to\r\nenable them to preserve their own health, and perform their duties to\r\nthemselves and their children. The most delicate subjects are treated in\r\nlanguage so chaste as not to offend any pure mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOPINION OF DR. R. SHELTON MACKENZIE.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Oct. 1869.\r\n\r\n\"Believing that such a work as Dr. Napheys' 'Physical Life of Woman,'\r\ngiving a great deal of valuable information, explicitly and delicately,\r\nis likely to be of very essential importance to the fair sex, I cannot\r\nhesitate to express my favorable opinion of its object and execution.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLETTER RECEIVED FROM REV. GEO. BRINGHURST,\r\n\r\nRector of the P. E. Church of the \"Messiah,\" Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, Sept. 1869.\r\nDR. GEO. H. NAPHEYS--\r\n\r\n_My Dear Sir_: I have perused with considerable care and pleasure the\r\nwork on the \"Physical Life of Woman,\" and feel no hesitation in\r\npronouncing it admirably composed, honest, succinct, refined, and worthy\r\nof the companionship of every lady of this age. I hail its appearance\r\nwith gratitude, and look upon it as a valuable contribution to those\r\nefforts which are making in various directions to elevate the tone of\r\nmorals of the nineteenth century, and to enable mothers to discharge\r\nfaithfully the duties they owe their children.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\nGEORGE BRINGHURST.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM H. N. EASTMAN, M.D.,\r\n\r\nProfessor of Practical Medicine in Geneva Medical College.\r\n\r\nGENEVA, Sept. 1869.\r\nGEO. H. NAPHEYS, M.D.--\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_: I have just completed a careful reading of your advance\r\nsheets of \"The Physical Life of Woman,\" and I unhesitatingly pronounce\r\nit an admirable work, and one especially needed at this time. The book\r\nis written in a chaste, elevated, and vigorous style, is replete with\r\ninstruction indispensable to the welfare and happiness of woman, and\r\nshould be placed in the hands of every mature maiden and matron in our\r\nland.\r\n\r\nH. N. EASTMAN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEDITORIAL FROM PHILADELPHIA MEDICAL AND SURGICAL REPORTER.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact, that in this country, most of the works on\r\nmedical and hygienic matters have been written by irregular\r\npractitioners in order to help on its legs some ism or pathy of their\r\nown. The public is really desirous of information about the great\r\nquestions of life and health. It buys whatever is offered it, and cannot\r\ntell of course the tares from the wheat. In fact, as we have said, there\r\nhas been very little wheat offered it. Scientific physicians do not seem\r\nto have taken the pains in this country, as in Germany, to expand sound\r\nmedical information among the people.\r\n\r\nWe therefore welcome all the more warmly a work which, under any\r\ncircumstances, would command our praise, advance sheets of which are now\r\nbefore us. The author is Dr. George H. Napheys, of this city, well\r\nknown to all the readers of the \"Reporter\" as a constant contributor to\r\nits pages for a number of years, a close student of therapeutics, and a\r\npleasing writer. The title of the book is \"The Physical Life of Woman:\r\nadvice to the Maiden, Wife, and Mother.\" It is a complete manual of\r\ninformation for women, in their peculiar conditions and relations,\r\nmarried and single.\r\n\r\nThe style is simple, agreeable, and eminently proper and delicate,\r\nconspicuously so when treating of such difficult topics to handle in a\r\npopular book, yet so necessary to be handled, as the marital relations\r\nof husband and wife, the consummation of marriage, etc.\r\n\r\nWe do not doubt that this work will find as large a sale both in and out\r\nof the profession in this country, as the works of Bock and Klencke in\r\nGermany, and of Tilt and Chavasse in England.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM THE NASHVILLE JOURNAL OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY FOR NOVEMBER, 1869.\r\n\r\nThe outside of this book is more stylish and artistic than any the\r\nmarket has owed to the press this season. The type and paper of the\r\ninside are in keeping with the elegant exterior. The work contains much\r\nvaluable matter, in a style peculiarly attractive. It is intended to\r\ntreat woman as a rational being, to let her know much about herself as a\r\nwoman, that from this knowledge she may prevent and therefore escape\r\nmuch of the suffering endured by her sex.\r\n\r\nAnd who can do this but a physician? This may be regarded as the first\r\nattempt of the kind in this country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM THE MEDICAL RECORD, NEW YORK, JAN. 15, 1870.\r\n\r\nDoctor Napheys, in his work on \"The Physical Life of Woman,\" has\r\nacquitted himself with infinite credit. The subject, which for a work of\r\nits size takes a very wide range, is treated in choice, nay elegant\r\nlanguage, and we have not noticed a single expression upon the most\r\ndelicate matter that could offend the most refined taste. There are,\r\ntoo, a great many interesting historical facts connected with the\r\ngeneral topic, both in an ethical and physiological point of view, which\r\nshow much discrimination in their production, and a good amount of\r\nsterling scholarship. To the medical reader there are many points in the\r\nbook that are worthy of attention, prominent among which are remarks\r\nbearing upon the right of limitation of offspring. We sincerely hope\r\nthat, for the real benefit of American women, it may meet with a hearty\r\nreception, and be productive of great good, in preventing many of those\r\ndisorders now so rife in the community, which are solely the result of\r\nignorance of the ordinary laws of female hygiene.\r\n\r\nNo one, however scrupulous, need fear to admit the work within the pale\r\nof his family circle, and place it, with confidence, in the hands of his\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM THE NEW YORK MEDICAL GAZETTE, JAN. 8, 1870.\r\n\r\nThough professedly written for popular instruction, this little book\r\nwill not fail to instruct as well the professional reader. We cordially\r\nrecommend the perusal of Dr. Napheys' book to every woman seeking a\r\nfuller acquaintance with her physical organism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM THE BOSTON MEDICAL AND SURGICAL JOURNAL, NOV. 25, 1869.\r\n\r\nMost valuable for the perusal of mothers, and of those fathers who may\r\nbe equal to the task of advising sons liable to commit matrimony. The\r\nstyle--of the text--is unexceptionable. Words are not wasted, and those\r\nused are to the point. The volume is not a mere _resumé_ of others'\r\nopinions; but the author has made the topics of which he treats his own.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM THE CHICAGO MEDICAL EXAMINER OF NOV. 1869.\r\n\r\nThis work is written in a plain and pleasing style, well calculated both\r\nto please and instruct. There is nothing of the _sensational_ or\r\nimaginative character in it. On the contrary, its teachings are in\r\nstrict accordance with scientific facts and good sense. Though designed\r\nspecially for females, yet a careful perusal would be productive of much\r\nbenefit to both sexes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM THE METHODIST HOME JOURNAL, DEC. 4, 1860.\r\n\r\nHitherto, the subjects so honestly and so skilfully treated in this\r\nvolume have, to a very great extent, been ruled out of the realm of\r\npopular knowledge, and information of this class sought only in a\r\nclandestine manner. The people have suffered by deplorable ignorance on\r\nthose topics, which should be as familiar to us as the alphabet. Dr.\r\nNapheys, by his scientific handling of the physiological points which\r\nrelate to health, training, and development, has rendered a great\r\nservice to the world. This, the press, and public men, have not been\r\nslow to acknowledge. The book has gained unqualified praise, and well\r\ndeserves it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM THE PRESBYTERIAN, OF PHILADELPHIA, DEC. 4, '69.\r\n\r\nA book which treats wisely and delicately of very important subjects,\r\nand subjects which ought to be treated by competent hands, instead of\r\nbeing left to quacks and the venders of nostrums. Dr. Napheys is\r\nevidently a conscientious and intelligent physician, and his counsels\r\nare such as may be put in the hands of all persons needing such\r\ncounsels. We commend it for its judicious exposition of the laws of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM THE NEW YORK CHRISTIAN UNION, JAN. 8, 1870.\r\n\r\nSociety owes a debt of gratitude to this brave and scientific physician\r\nfor the unexceptionable way in which he has performed a work that has,\r\nup to the publication of this book, been a paramount need, not to be\r\nsatisfied anywhere in the English language. If the volume contained only\r\nthe chapter on the influence of the mother's mind upon her unborn child,\r\nwe would recommend its purchase by every family in the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM THE PHILA. EVENING TELEGRAPH, OCT. 6, 1869.\r\n\r\nThis is a work by a physician of reputation on the hygiene of woman,\r\ndesigned for popular use, and introducing a variety of topics not\r\ngenerally discussed outside of regular scientific medical works. Dr.\r\nNapheys writes with dignity and earnestness, and there is not a chapter\r\nin his book that may not be read by persons of both sexes. Of course\r\nsuch a work as this is intended for men and women of mature years, and\r\nit is not suitable to be left lying about for the gratification of idle\r\ncuriosity. The author has been careful to write nothing that can\r\npossibly give offence, and he conveys much sound instruction that, if\r\nheeded by those to whom it is particularly addressed, will save much\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM THE INDEPENDENT, NEW YORK, NOV. 11, 1869.\r\n\r\nIt required a brave but sensitively pure man to provide for the want\r\nwhich existed for some reliable medical instruction upon points which\r\nevery woman and every married man ought to know, and few do. Dr. Napheys\r\nwe do not know personally. But his book is at once brave and pure. It is\r\nwritten in such a spirit that she who really desires to learn the truths\r\nof which she cannot with justice to herself or others be ignorant, may\r\ndo so without being shocked; while he who hopes to stimulate a vicious\r\nimagination by its perusal will turn from its pages disappointed away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM REV. HENRY CLAY TRUMBULL,\r\n\r\nSecretary of New England Department of Missions of the American\r\nSunday-school Union.\r\n\r\nHARTFORD, CT., Oct. 1869.\r\n\r\nGEO. H. NAPHEYS, M.D.--\r\n\r\n_My Dear Sir_: Understanding, from my long acquaintance with you, your\r\nthoroughness of mental culture, your delicacy of sentiment, and your\r\nsound good sense, I was prepared to approve heartily the tone and style\r\nof your new work, \"The Physical Life of Woman,\" when its advance sheets\r\nwere first placed in my hands.\r\n\r\nA close examination of it convinces me that it is a book which can be\r\nread by every woman to her instruction and advantage. Its manner is\r\nunexceptionable. Its style is remarkably simple. Its substance evidences\r\nyour professional knowledge and your extensive study. I believe it needs\r\nonly to be brought to notice to commend itself widely. I think you have\r\ndone an excellent work in its preparation.\r\n\r\nSincerely your friend,\r\n\r\nH. CLAY TRUMBULL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM THE REV. W. H. H. MURRAY,\r\n\r\nPastor of the Park Street Church, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\nDEC. 2, 1871.\r\n\r\nIt is with sincere gratitude to the author that I give my endorsement to\r\nthe book entitled \"The Physical Life of Woman.\" Never was such a work\r\nmore needed anywhere, or in any age, than it is in America at this time.\r\nI should rejoice at its introduction among the people until every wife\r\nand mother in the country and the world had a copy in her possession. In\r\nit the author has indeed given needed instruction and warning. He\r\ndeserves the thanks of every Christian and well-wisher of the race.\r\n\r\nW. H. H. MURRAY.",
