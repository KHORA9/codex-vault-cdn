She was engaged\r\nduring them in carrying their \"joint work unfinished\" into a new field.\r\nIn the previous volume we saw Miss Nightingale using her position as the\r\nheroine of the Crimean War in order to become the founder of modern\r\nnursing, and to initiate reforms for the welfare of the British soldier.\r\nAmong those who know, it is recognized that the services which she\r\nrendered to the British army at home were hardly greater than those\r\nwhich she was able to render to British India, and it was this Indian\r\nwork which after Sidney Herbert's death became one of the main interests\r\nof her life. She threw herself into it, as we shall hear, with full\r\nfire, and brought to it abundant energy and resource. But first she had\r\nthe memory of her friend to honour and protect; and then the hours of\r\ngloom were to be deepened by the loss of another friend hardly less dear\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving finished her Paper upon Sidney Herbert, Miss Nightingale left the\r\nBurlington Hotel, never to return, and took lodgings in Hampstead\r\n(Aug.-Oct. 1861). Her mood was of deep despondency. She was inclined to\r\nshut herself off from most of her former fellow-workers. Against the\r\noutside world she double-barred her shutters. Her uncle was strictly\r\nenjoined to give no one her address; she asked that all her letters\r\nmight be addressed to and from his care in London. The formula was to be\r\nthat \"a great and overwhelming affliction entirely precludes Miss\r\nNightingale\" from seeing or writing to anybody. \"For her sake it is most\r\nearnestly to be wished,\" wrote her cousin Beatrice to Mr. Chadwick\r\n(Sept. 18), \"that you may come into some immediate communication with\r\nher. It is your faith that her working days are not yet over, that she\r\nmay work in another field, her own being now closed against her. I\r\ncannot find that any of those who have been with her lately would share\r\nthis hope, less on account of her health, than of her state of extreme\r\ndiscouragement.\" It was a case not only, perhaps not chiefly, of\r\npersonal loss, but also of public vexation; it was not only that the\r\nMinister had died, it was that his work seemed like to die also. The\r\npoint of view appears in her letters to Dr. Farr:--\r\n\r\n     _Sept._ 10. We are grateful to you for the memorial of my dear\r\n     Master which you have raised to him in the hearts of the nation.[1]\r\n     Indeed it is in the hearts of the nation that he will live--not in\r\n     the hearts of Ministers. There he is dead already, if indeed they\r\n     have any. And before he was cold in his grave, Gladstone attends\r\n     his funeral and then writes to me that he cannot pledge himself to\r\n     give any assistance in carrying out his friend's reforms. The reign\r\n     of intelligence at the War Office is over. The reign of muffs has\r\n     begun. The only rule of conduct in the bureaucracy there and in the\r\n     Horse Guards is to reverse _his_ decision, _his_ judgment, and (if\r\n     they can do nothing more) _his_ words.\r\n\r\n  [1] An eloquent address delivered to the British Association at\r\n      Manchester (_Times_, Sept. 9, 1861).\r\n\r\n     _October_ 2.... My poor Master has been dead two months to-day, too\r\n     long a time for him not to be forgotten.... The dogs have trampled\r\n     on his dead body. Alas! seven years this month I have fought the\r\n     good fight with the War Office _and lost it_!\r\n\r\n     _November_ 2. My dear Master has been dead three months to-day.\r\n     Poor Lady Herbert goes abroad this next week with the children and\r\n     shuts up Wilton, the eldest boy going to school. It is as if the\r\n     earth had opened and swallowed up even the Name which filled my\r\n     whole life these five years.\r\n\r\nBut there were things to be done in her friend's name, and she turned to\r\ndo them. The power of the bureaucracy to resist was strong, because the\r\nnew Secretary of State was a novice at his task, and Lord Herbert, by\r\nfailing to carry through any radical reorganization of the War Office,\r\nhad as she said, failed to put in \"the mainspring to his works.\" \"The\r\nCommander-in-Chief rides over the learned Secretary of State as if he\r\nwere straw.\" But there was one hopeful and helpful factor in the case.\r\nNow that the Secretary for War was in the Commons, Lord de Grey was\r\nreappointed Under-Secretary. He was a genuine reformer. He knew the mind\r\nof his former Chief. He was most sympathetic to Lady Herbert. He was\r\nacquainted with Miss Nightingale. The power of an Under-Secretary is\r\nvery small, but what he could do, he would. A letter which she received\r\nfrom a friend, both of Lord de Grey and of herself, gave her\r\nencouragement:--\r\n\r\n     (_R. Monckton Milnes to Miss Nightingale._) _October_ 21. I knew how\r\n     irreparable a loss you and your objects in life had in Herbert's\r\n     death, but I should like you to know how you will find Ld. de Grey\r\n     willing to do all in his power to forward your great and wise\r\n     designs. I say \"in his power,\" for that, you know, is extremely\r\n     limited, but he may do something for you in an indirect way and,\r\n     without much originality, he has considerable tact and adroitness.\r\n     You won't like Sir G. Lewis, but somewhere or other you ought to do\r\n     so; for in his sincere way of looking at things and in his critical\r\n     and curious spirit he is by no means unlike yourself. He makes up\r\n     his mind, no doubt, far better to the damnabilities of the work\r\n     than you would do,--tho' one does not know what you would have been\r\n     if you had been corrupted by public life. I write this about de\r\n     Grey because I was staying with him not long ago, and he expressed\r\n     himself on the subject with much earnestness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nSo, then, there were some things perhaps which might yet, as she put it,\r\nbe \"saved from the wreck.\" Lord de Grey had already given earnest both\r\nof his good will and of his courage. He had seen Lady Herbert and asked\r\nabout her husband's intentions. She knew them generally, but referred\r\nfor details to Miss Nightingale, who was thus able to be of some use in\r\ncarrying through Lord Herbert's scheme for a Soldiers' Home at\r\nAldershot. Then there was the question of the General Hospital to be\r\nbuilt at Woolwich. The Commander-in-Chief was opposed to the scheme, and\r\nasked Sir George Lewis to cancel it. Economy was, perhaps, behind the\r\nMinister tempting him. But Lord de Grey, who was present at the\r\ninterview, stood firm. \"Sir,\" he said, \"it is impossible. Lord Herbert\r\ndecided it, and the House of Commons voted it.\"[2] In the end, the Horse\r\nGuards and the War Office accepted the inevitable with a good grace; the\r\norder was given for the building to proceed, and Miss Nightingale's\r\nsuggestion was adopted that it should be christened \"The Herbert\r\nHospital.\"\r\n\r\n  [2] Miss Nightingale related this incident in two letters--to Dr. Farr\r\n      (Sept. 10), and to Harriet Martineau (Sept. 24).\r\n\r\nLord de Grey was also influential in securing a redefinition of Captain\r\nGalton's duties at the War Office. Lady Herbert told Lord de Grey that\r\nthis was one of the last official matters on which she had heard her\r\nhusband speak. Miss Nightingale again supplied the details, and to her\r\nally was committed responsibility (under the Secretary of State) for new\r\nbarrack works. On some other questions Miss Nightingale had the\r\nbitterness of seeing projects abandoned which she and Lord Herbert had\r\nalmost matured. \"It is really melancholy now,\" wrote Captain Galton to\r\nher (Aug. 19), \"to see the attempts made on all hands to pull down all\r\nthat Sidney Herbert laboured to build up.\" She recounted some of the\r\ndisappointments in a letter to Harriet Martineau, and that lady, whose\r\ngenuine sympathy in the cause was perhaps heightened by a journalist's\r\nscent for \"copy,\" was eager to go on the war-path. \"No harm can come,\"\r\nshe wrote to Miss Nightingale (Oct. 4), \"of an attempt to shame the\r\nHorse Guards. I have consulted my editor [of the _Daily News_], and if I\r\ncan obtain a sufficiency of clear facts, I will gladly harass the\r\nCommander-in-Chief as he was never harassed before--that is, I will\r\nwrite a leader against him every Saturday for as many weeks as there are\r\nheads of accusation against him and his Department. We don't want to\r\nmince matters.\" Miss Nightingale was to supply the powder and shot; Miss\r\nMartineau was to fire the guns. The partnership was declined by Miss\r\nNightingale. The reason she gave was that she was no longer in the way\r\nof obtaining much inside information. But she doubtless had other\r\nreasons. There were things which she had just managed to carry through.\r\nThere were other possibilities of usefulness before her. She was playing\r\na difficult game. She did not think that her hand would be strengthened\r\nby newspaper polemics, for the form of which she would not be\r\nresponsible, but the information in which would be traced back to her.\r\nAmong the points which she had just managed to score was the appointment\r\nof the Commission already mentioned,[3] for extending the Barracks\r\nInquiry to the Mediterranean stations. Headquarters tried to stop it.\r\n\"And I defeated them,\" she had told Miss Martineau (Sept. 24), \"by a\r\ntrick which they were too stupid to find out.\" Her papers do not\r\ndisclose the nature of the \"trick\" by which this excellent piece of work\r\nwas carried through.\r\n\r\n  [3] See Vol. I. p. 405.\r\n\r\nAnd there was another thing which she did in order to forward Sidney\r\nHerbert's work, though in a field outside that of their collaboration:\r\nshe wrote a stirring letter (Oct. 8) on the Volunteer Movement, which he\r\nhad organized in 1859. It brought her several \"offers,\" as we have heard\r\nalready[4]; and, displayed in large print on a card, must have attracted\r\nmany recruits. She wrote it as one who had experience of war and its\r\nlessons; as one, too, who had worked for the Army, \"seven years this\r\nvery month, without the intermission of one single waking hour.\" She\r\nmade eloquent appeal to the patriotic spirit of the British people; and\r\nshe included this piece of personal feeling: \"On the saddest night of\r\nall my life, two months ago, when my dear chief Sidney Herbert lay\r\ndying, and I knew that with him died much of the welfare of the British\r\nArmy--he was, too, so proud, so justly proud, of his Volunteers--on that\r\nnight I lay listening to the bands of the Volunteers as they came\r\nmarching in successively--it had been a review-day--and I said to\r\nmyself, 'The nation can never go back which is capable of such a\r\nmovement as this; not the spirit of an hour; these are men who have all\r\nsomething to give up; all men whose time is valuable for money, which is\r\nnot their god, as other nations say of us.'\" I do not know if the name\r\nof Florence Nightingale be still--as it ought to be--a name of power\r\nwith the people. If it is, then her letter of 1861 might well be\r\nreprinted in connection with recruiting for the Territorial Force. She\r\nlaid stress upon the voluntary spirit, as opposed to compulsion. But she\r\nlaid stress also on the supreme importance of efficient training:\r\n\"Garibaldi's Volunteers did excellently in guerilla movements; they\r\nfailed before a fourth-rate regular army.\"\r\n\r\n  [4] Vol. I. p. 496.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nPresently some old work in a new form came in Miss Nightingale's way.\r\nShe had returned to London in November, chiefly in order to be on the\r\nspot for consultation and suggestion in connection with the Memorial to\r\nSidney Herbert. It was her suggestion, for one thing, that the Memorial\r\nshould include a Prize Medal at the Army Medical School. For this\r\nsojourn in London, Sir Harry Verney lent his house in South Street[5] to\r\nMiss Nightingale. The American Civil War now kept her busy. \"Did I tell\r\nyou,\" she wrote to Dr. Farr (Oct. 8), \"that I had forwarded to the War\r\nSecretary at Washington, upon application, all our War Office Forms and\r\nReports, statistical and other, taking the occasion to tell them that,\r\nas the U.S. had adopted our Registrar-General's nomenclature, it would\r\nbe easier for them to adopt our Army Statistics Forms. It appears that\r\nthey, the Northern States, are quite puzzled by their own want of any\r\nArmy organization. I also took occasion to tell them of our Chinese\r\nsuccess in reducing the Army mortality to one-tenth of what it was, and\r\nthe Constantly Sick to one-seventh of what they were during the first\r\nwinter of the Crimean War, due to my dear master.\" When the Civil War\r\nbroke out, Miss Nightingale's example in the Crimea had produced an\r\nimmediate effect. A \"Woman's Central Association of Relief\" was formed\r\nin New York. In co-operation with other bodies they petitioned the\r\nSecretary of War to appoint a Sanitary Commission, and after some delay\r\nthis was done. Camps were inspected; female nurses were sent to the\r\nhospitals; contrivances for improved cooking were supplied, and in\r\nshort, much of Miss Nightingale's Crimean work was reproduced.[6]\r\nPresently she became more directly concerned. At the end of the year\r\n(1861) England was on the verge of being embroiled in the conflict, and,\r\nwhilst the agitation over the _Trent_ affair was at its height, the\r\nBritish Government decided to send reinforcements to Canada. Lord de\r\nGrey was charged with many of the preparations. He asked Miss\r\nNightingale (Dec. 3) if he might consult her personally \"as to sanitary\r\narrangements generally.\" He wished to profit by her experience and\r\njudgment in relation to transports, hospitals, clothing of the troops,\r\nsupplies, comforts for the sick, and generally upon \"the defects and\r\ndangers to be feared,\" and how best to prevent them. He also asked for\r\nthe names of suitable men for the position of Principal Medical Officer,\r\nand he consulted her again before making the appointment. Without a\r\nmoment's loss of time, she set to work in conjunction with Dr.\r\nSutherland, and sent in her suggestions. The draft instructions to the\r\nofficers in charge of the expedition were sent to her on December 8. On\r\nDecember 10 Lord de Grey wrote: \"I have got all your suggestions\r\ninserted in the Instructions, and am greatly obliged to you for them.\"\r\n\"We are shipping off the Expedition to Canada as fast as we can,\" she\r\nwrote to Madame Mohl (Dec. 13). \"I have been working just as I did in\r\nthe times of Sidney Herbert. Alas! he left no organization, my dear\r\nmaster! But the Horse Guards were so terrified at the idea of the\r\nnational indignation if they lost another army, that they have\r\nconsented to everything.\" A few days later another draft of\r\ninstructions was sent to her through Captain Galton. \"We have gone over\r\nyour draft very carefully,\" she wrote (Dec. 18), \"and find that although\r\nit includes almost everything necessary, it does not define with\r\nsufficient precision the manner in which the meat is to get from the\r\nCommissariat into the soldier's kettle, or the clothing from the Army\r\nMedical General store on to the soldier's back. You must define all\r\nthis. Otherwise you will have men, as you had in the Crimea, shirking\r\nthe responsibility.\" Memoranda among Miss Nightingale's papers show the\r\ngrasp of detail with which she worked out the problems. Her mind\r\nenvisaged the scene of operations. She calculated the distances which\r\nmight have to be covered by sledges; she counted the relays and depots;\r\nshe compared the relative weights and warming capacities of blankets and\r\nbuffalo robes. A great Commander was lost to her country when Florence\r\nNightingale was born a woman. Her suggestions in the case of the\r\nCanadian reinforcements were happily not put to the test of war. The\r\n_Trent_ affair was smoothed over, largely, as is now well known, owing\r\nto the moderating counsels of the Prince Consort. It was his last\r\nservice to his adopted country. Miss Nightingale felt his death to be a\r\nnational loss. \"He neither liked,\" she said of him, \"nor was liked. But\r\nwhat he has done for our country no one knows.\"\r\n\r\n  [5] No. 32 at that time; now renumbered, No. 4.\r\n\r\n  [6] See on this subject Bibliography B, No. 23. The Secretary of another\r\n      body, the United States Christian Communion, in sending reports and\r\n      papers to Miss Nightingale (July 26, 1865) wrote: \"Your influence and\r\n      our indebtedness to you can never be known. Only this is true that\r\n      everywhere throughout our broad country during these years of\r\n      inventive and earnest benevolence in the constant endeavour to\r\n      succour and sustain our heroic defenders, the name and work of\r\n      Florence Nightingale have been an encouragement and inspiration.\" In\r\n      the same year the plans of an Emigrant Hospital on Ward Island were\r\n      sent to her. In return she sent engravings of the Departure and the\r\n      Arrival of the Pilgrim Fathers: \"Presented to the Commissioners of\r\n      Emigration of New York for the new Emigrant Hospital on Ward Island\r\n      by Florence Nightingale as a slight sign of her deepest reverence and\r\n      her warmest sympathy for the noble act by which they have so\r\n      magnificently provided for--not their own sick, but--those of the Old\r\n      Country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's work in connection with the Canadian expedition was\r\ndone in the midst of a personal sorrow of her own, second only in\r\npoignancy, if second at all, to that caused by the death of Sidney\r\nHerbert. This was the death of Arthur Hugh Clough. He had broken down in\r\nhealth and been ordered abroad in April 1861, and she had urged him to\r\ngo. He died, however, at Florence on November 12. They had been close\r\nfriends since her return to England from the Crimea. His sweetness of\r\ndisposition, his humour, his lofty moral feeling, alike attracted her.\r\nHe on his side had deep admiration for her, and he devoted such\r\nstrength--alas! but little--as remained to him from work in the Privy\r\nCouncil Office to her service. He fetched and carried for her. He made\r\narrangements for her journeys, as we have heard, and escorted her. He\r\nsaw her printers, he corrected her proofs. He became, at a modest\r\nsalary, secretary to the Nightingale Fund. It was poor work to set a\r\npoet to, but he did it with cheerful modesty. He was intent, he told\r\nMiss Nightingale, upon \"doing plain work\"; he had \"studied and taught,\"\r\nhe said, \"too much for a man's own moral good.\" In 1860 his health began\r\nto fail. Miss Nightingale was sometimes a little impatient. His loyalty\r\nand zeal she could never have doubted; but she was inclined to think him\r\nlacking in initiative and energy. She was always inclined to drive\r\nwilling horses a little hardly. In the case of Clough, as in that of\r\nSidney Herbert, she sometimes attributed to infirmity of will what was\r\nin fact due to infirmity of body. And in each case her grief, when the\r\nend came, was not free, I think, from some element of self-reproach. \"I\r\nhave always felt,\" she had written to her uncle (Dec. 7, 1860), \"that I\r\nhave been a great drag on Arthur's health and spirits, a much greater\r\none than I should have chosen to be, if I had not promised him to die\r\nsooner.\" \"She saw my father,\" wrote her cousin Beatrice to\r\nMr. Nightingale (Dec. 4), \"to speak only of Arthur, as only she can\r\nspeak. She was quite natural, very affectionate, very, very much moved.\"\r\nBut in her state of loneliness and nervous exhaustion her feeling for\r\nlost friends was sometimes morbid. She said that for months after the\r\ndeath of Sidney Herbert, and again after that of Clough, she could not\r\nbear to open a newspaper for dread of seeing some mention of a beloved\r\nname. Some years later she was sent a book by Mrs. Clough. \"I like very\r\nmuch,\" she replied (Nov. 13, 1865)--\"how much I cannot say--to receive\r\nthat book from you. But it would be impossible to me to read it or look\r\nat it, not from want of time or strength, but from too much of both\r\nspent on his memory, from thinking, not too little, but too much on him.\r\nBut I don't say this for others. I believe it is a morbid peculiarity of\r\nlong illness, of the loss of power of resistance to morbid thoughts. I\r\ncannot bear to see a portrait of those who are gone.\" The depth of her\r\ngrief at the death of Mr. Clough is expressed or reflected in letters\r\nwhich she wrote or received at the time:--\r\n\r\n     (_Benjamin Jowett to Miss Nightingale._) BALLIOL, _Nov._ 19 [1861].\r\n     Thank you for writing to me. I am very much grieved at the tidings\r\n     which your letter brought me. I agree entirely in your estimate of\r\n     our dear friend's character. It was in 1836 (the anniversary is\r\n     next week) that I first saw him when he was elected to the Balliol\r\n     Scholarship. No one who only knew him in later life would imagine\r\n     what a noble, striking-looking youth he was before he got worried\r\n     with false views of religion and the world. I never met with any\r\n     one who was more thoroughly high-minded: I believe he acted all\r\n     through life simply from the feeling of what was right. He\r\n     certainly had great genius, but some want of will or some want of\r\n     harmony with things around him prevented his creating anything\r\n     worthy of himself. I am glad he was married: life was dark to him,\r\n     and his wife and children made him as happy as he was capable of\r\n     being made. He was naturally very religious, and I think that he\r\n     never recovered the rude shock which his religion received during\r\n     his first years at Oxford. He did not see and yet he believed in\r\n     the great belief of all--to do rightly. Did I quote to you ever an\r\n     expression which Neander used to me of Blanco White: _einer Christ\r\n     mehr in Unbewusstseyn als in Bewusstseyn_? It grieves me that you\r\n     should have lost so invaluable a friend. No earthly trial can be\r\n     greater than to pursue without friends the work that you began with\r\n     them. And yet it is the more needed because it rests on one only.\r\n     If there be any way in this world to be like Christ it must be by\r\n     pursuing in solitude and illness, without the support of sympathy\r\n     or public opinion, works for the good of mankind. I hope you will\r\n     sometimes let me hear from you. Let me assure you that I shall\r\n     never cease to take an interest in your objects and writings.--Ever\r\n     yours sincerely, B. JOWETT.\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Sir John McNeill._) SOUTH STREET, _Nov._ 18....\r\n     He was a man of rare mind and temper. The more so because he\r\n     would gladly do \"plain work.\" To me, seeing the blundering harasses\r\n     which were the uses to which we put him, he seemed like a\r\n     race-horse harnessed to a coal truck. This not because he did\r\n     \"plain work\" and did it so well. For the best of us can be put to\r\n     no better use than that. He helped me immensely, though not\r\n     officially, by his sound judgment and constant sympathy. \"Oh,\r\n     Jonathan, my brother Jonathan, my love to thee was very great,\r\n     passing the love of woman.\" Now, not one man remains (that I can\r\n     call a man) of all those whom these five years I have worked with.\r\n     But, as you say, \"we are all dying.\"\r\n\r\n     (_Sir John McNeill to Miss Nightingale._) EDINBURGH, _November_ 19.\r\n     I should find it difficult to tell you how much your letter has\r\n     distressed me. I do not know that I have ever cared so much for any\r\n     man of whom I had seen so little as I did for Clough. Perhaps it\r\n     may not have been all on his own account, for to know that he was\r\n     near you was a comfort, but if he had not been altogether estimable\r\n     in head and heart this mixed feeling could not have arisen. His\r\n     death leaves you dreadfully alone in the midst of your work, but\r\n     that work is your life and you can do it alone. There is no feeling\r\n     more sustaining than that of being alone--at least I have ever\r\n     found it so. To mount my horse and ride over the desert alone with\r\n     the sky closing the circle in which my horse and I were the only\r\n     living things, I have always found intensely elating. To work out\r\n     views in which no one helped me has all my life been to me a source\r\n     of vitality and strength. So I doubt not it will be to you, for you\r\n     have a strength and a power for good to which I never could\r\n     pretend. It is a small matter to die a few days sooner than usual.\r\n     It is a great matter to work while it is day, and so to husband\r\n     one's power as to make the most of the days that are given us. This\r\n     you will do. Herbert and Clough and many more may fall around you,\r\n     but you are destined to do a great work and you cannot die till it\r\n     is substantially, if not apparently, done. You are leaving your\r\n     impress on the age in which you live, and the print of your foot\r\n     will be traced by generations yet unborn. Go on--to you the\r\n     accidents of mortality ought to be as the falling of the leaves in\r\n     autumn. Ever respectfully and sincerely yours, JOHN MCNEILL.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was able, as her friends predicted, to pursue in hours\r\nof gloom the tasks which in hours of insight she had willed; and to\r\ncontinue, without the same sympathy from close friends as before, the\r\nkind of work which she had once done with Sidney Herbert's co-operation\r\nor with Clough's advice. But she yearned for sympathy none the less; in\r\na noble, though an exacting, way. For by \"sympathy\" she understood not\r\nsuch feeling as would be expressed merely in affectionate behaviour or\r\npersonal consideration for herself, but a fellow-feeling for her objects\r\nexpressed in readiness to follow her in serving them with something of\r\nher own practical devotion. She did not think of herself apart from her\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Madame Mohl._) 32 SOUTH STREET, LONDON,\r\n     _Dec_. 13 [1861]. I have read half your book thro' [_Madame\r\n     Récamier_], and am immensely charmed by it. But some things I\r\n     disagree with and more I do not understand. This does not apply to\r\n     the characters, but to your conclusions, _e.g._ you say \"women are\r\n     more sympathetic than men.\" Now if I were to write a book out of my\r\n     experience, I should begin _Women have no sympathy_. Yours is the\r\n     tradition. Mine is the conviction of experience. I have never found\r\n     one woman who has altered her life by one iota for me or my\r\n     opinions. Now look at my experience of men. A statesman, past\r\n     middle age, absorbed in politics for a quarter of a century, out of\r\n     sympathy with me, remodels his whole life and policy--learns a\r\n     science the driest, the most technical, the most difficult, that of\r\n     administration, as far as it concerns the lives of men,--not, as I\r\n     learnt it, in the field from stirring experience, but by writing\r\n     dry regulations in a London room by my sofa with me. This is what I\r\n     call real sympathy. Another (Alexander, whom I made\r\n     Director-General) does very nearly the same thing. He is dead too.\r\n     Clough, a poet born if ever there was one, takes to\r\n     nursing-administration in the same way, for me. I only mention\r\n     three whose whole lives were remodelled by sympathy for me. But I\r\n     could mention very many others--Farr, McNeill, Tulloch, Storks,\r\n     Martin, who in a lesser degree have altered their work by my\r\n     opinions. And, the most wonderful of all, a man born without a\r\n     soul, like Undine--all these elderly men.\r\n\r\n     Now just look at the degree in which women have sympathy--as far as\r\n     my experience is concerned. And my experience of women is almost as\r\n     large as Europe. And it is so intimate too. I have lived and slept\r\n     in the same bed with English Countesses and Prussian Bäuerinnen.\r\n     No Roman Catholic Supérieure has ever had charge of women of the\r\n     different creeds that I have had. No woman has excited \"passions\"\r\n     among women more than I have. Yet I leave no school behind me. My\r\n     doctrines have taken no hold among women. Not one of my Crimean\r\n     following learnt anything from me, or gave herself for one moment\r\n     after she came home to carry out the lesson of that war or of those\r\n     hospitals.... No woman that I know has ever _appris à apprendre_. And\r\n     I attribute this to want of sympathy. You say somewhere that women\r\n     have no attention. Yes. And I attribute this to want of sympathy.\r\n     Nothing makes me so impatient as people complaining of their want of\r\n     memory. How can you remember what you have never heard?... It makes\r\n     me mad, the Women's Rights talk about \"the want of a field\" for\r\n     them--when I know that I would gladly give £500 a year for a Woman\r\n     Secretary. And two English Lady Superintendents have told me the same\r\n     thing. And we can't get _one_.... They don't know the names of the\r\n     Cabinet Ministers. They don't know the offices at the Horse Guards.\r\n     They don't know who of the men of the day is dead and who is alive.\r\n     They don't know which of the Churches has Bishops and which not. Now\r\n     I'm sure I did not know these things. When I went to the Crimea I did\r\n     not know a Colonel from a Corporal. But there are such things as Army\r\n     Lists and Almanacs. Yet I never could find a woman who, out of\r\n     sympathy, would consult one--for my work. The only woman I ever\r\n     influenced by sympathy was one of those Lady Superintendents I have\r\n     named. Yet she is like me, overwhelmed with her own business.... In\r\n     one sense, I do believe I am \"like a man,\" as Parthe says. But how?\r\n     _In having sympathy._ I am sure I have nothing else. I am sure I have\r\n     no genius. I am sure that my contemporaries, Parthe, Hilary, Marianne,\r\n     Lady Dunsany, were all cleverer than I was, and several of them\r\n     more unselfish. But not one had a bit of sympathy. Now Sidney\r\n     Herbert's wife just did the Secretary's work for her husband (which\r\n     I have had to do without) out of pure sympathy. She did not\r\n     understand his policy. Yet she could write his letters for him\r\n     \"like a man.\" I should think M^{me} Récamier was another specimen\r\n     of pure sympathy.... Women crave _for being loved_, not for loving.\r\n     They scream out at you for sympathy all day long, they are\r\n     incapable of giving any in return, for they cannot remember your\r\n     affairs long enough to do so.... They cannot state a fact\r\n     accurately to another, nor can that other attend to it accurately\r\n     enough for it to become information. Now is not all this the result\r\n     of want of sympathy?...\r\n\r\n     You say of M^{me} Récamier that her existence was \"empty but\r\n     brilliant.\" And you attribute it to want of family. Oh, dear\r\n     friend, don't give in to that sort of tradition. People often say\r\n     to me, You don't know what a wife and mother feels. No, I say, I\r\n     don't and I'm very glad I don't. And _they_ don't know what I\r\n     _feel_.... I am sick with indignation at what wives and mothers\r\n     will do of the most egregious selfishness. And people call it all\r\n     maternal or conjugal affection, and think it pretty to say so. No,\r\n     no, let each person tell the truth from his own experience. Ezekiel\r\n     went running about naked, \"for a sign.\" I can't run about naked\r\n     because it is not the custom of the country. But I would mount\r\n     three widows' caps on my head, \"for a sign.\" And I would cry, This\r\n     is for Sidney Herbert, This is for Arthur Clough, and This, the\r\n     biggest widow's cap of all, is for the loss of all sympathy on the\r\n     part of my dearest and nearest.[7] ...\r\n\r\n     I cannot understand how M^{me} Récamier could give \"advice and\r\n     sympathy\" to such opposite people as, _e.g._ M^{me} Salvage and\r\n     Chateaubriand. Neither can I understand how she could give\r\n     \"support\" without recommending a distinct line of policy,--by\r\n     merely keeping up the tone to a high one. It is as if I had said to\r\n     Sidney Herbert, Be a statesman, be a statesman--instead of\r\n     indicating to him a definite course of statesmanship to follow.\r\n     Also I am sure I never could have given \"advice and sympathy\" to\r\n     Gladstone and S. Herbert--men pursuing opposite lines of policy.\r\n     Also I am sure I never could have been the friend and adviser of\r\n     Sidney Herbert, of Alexander, and of others, by simply keeping up\r\n     the tone of general conversation on promiscuous matters. We debated\r\n     and settled _measures_ together. That is the way we did it. Adieu,\r\n     dear friend.... I have had two consultations. They say that all\r\n     this worry has brought on congestion of the spine which leads\r\n     straight to paralysis....\r\n\r\n  [7] The reference here is to the Aunt who, in earlier years, had been in\r\n      close companionship with her. At this time there was some\r\n      misunderstanding between them. Mrs. Smith's advancing age and home\r\n      claims brought a cessation of her constant activity in Miss\r\n      Nightingale's service; but in later years aunt and niece took much\r\n      counsel together in a resumed study of the religious subjects upon\r\n      which they had formerly held intimate converse: see below, pp. 353,\r\n      387.\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to her Mother._) 9 CHESTERFIELD ST., W., _March_\r\n     7 [1862]. DEAREST MOTHER--So far from your letters being a \"bore,\"\r\n     you are the only person who tells me any news. I have never been\r\n     able to get over the morbid feeling at seeing my lost two's names\r\n     in the paper, so that I see no paper. I did not know of the deaths\r\n     you mention.... But they and others do not know how much they are\r\n     spared by having no bitterness mingled with their grief. Such\r\n     unspeakable bitterness has been connected with each one of my\r\n     losses--far, far greater than the grief.... Sometimes I wonder that\r\n     I should be so impatient for death. Had I only to stand and wait, I\r\n     think it would be nothing, though the pain is so great that I\r\n     wonder how anybody can dread an operation.... I think what I have\r\n     felt most (during my last three months of extreme weakness) is the\r\n     not having one single person to give me one inspiring word or even\r\n     one correct fact. I am glad to end a day which never can come back,\r\n     gladder to end a night, gladdest to end a month. I have felt this\r\n     much more in setting up (for the first time in my life) a\r\n     fashionable old maid's house in a fashionable quarter (tho'\r\n     grateful to Papa's liberality for enabling me to do so), because it\r\n     is, as it were, deciding upon a new and independent course in my\r\n     broken old age.... Thank you very much for the weekly box. I could\r\n     not help sending the game, chicken, vegetables and flowers to\r\n     King's College Hospital. I never see the spring without thinking of\r\n     my Clough. He used to tell me how the leaves were coming\r\n     out--always remembering that, without his eyes, I should never see\r\n     the spring again. Thank God! my lost two are in brighter springs\r\n     than ours. Poor Mrs. Herbert told me that her chief comfort was in\r\n     a little Chinese dog of his, which he was not very fond of either\r\n     (he always said he liked Christians better than beasts), but which\r\n     used to come and kiss her eyelids and lick the tears from her\r\n     cheeks. I remember thinking this childish. But now I don't. My cat\r\n     does just the same to me. Dumb beasts observe you so much more than\r\n     talking beings; and know so much better what you are thinking\r\n     of.... Ever, dear Mama, your loving child, F.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the year, 1861-62, Miss Nightingale had been very ill;\r\nand two physicians, Dr. Williams and Dr. Sutherland, were in daily\r\nattendance. Happily, however, the case was by no means so serious as she\r\nhad reported to Madame Mohl, and in 1862 she was able to devote\r\nunremitting labour to one of the heaviest, and most useful, pieces of\r\nwork which she ever did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                     THE PROVIDENCE OF THE INDIAN ARMY\r\n\r\n                               (1862, 1863)\r\n\r\n\r\n     In this case you are doing much more than providing for the health\r\n     of the Troops; for, to be effectual, the improvement must extend to\r\n     the civil population, and thus another great element of\r\n     Civilization will be introduced.--SIR CHARLES TREVELYAN (_Letter to\r\n     Florence Nightingale_, Aug. 11, 1862).\r\n\r\nIt is a commonplace that the British Empire in India was won and is held\r\nby British arms. And this, though not the whole truth of the tenure by\r\nwhich the Empire is held, is true. What is also true, but less generally\r\nknown, is that there have been heavier sacrifices than those demanded in\r\nwar and rendered glorious by British valour. The greater part of the\r\nBritish lives that were shed in India were lost, not in battle, but by\r\ndisease. Burke said of British rule in India in his time: \"England has\r\nbuilt no bridges, made no high roads, cut no navigations. Were we driven\r\nout of India this day, nothing would remain to tell that it had been\r\npossessed, during the inglorious period of our dominion, by anything\r\nbetter than the ourang-outang or the tiger.\"[8] That was no longer true\r\nat the time with which we are here concerned. The era had begun in which\r\nit has been a song of the English to \"drive the road and bridge the\r\nford.\" But the land was not yet \"cleared of evil.\" The British soldier\r\nwas still sent out to India to die ingloriously by the neglect of\r\nsanitary laws.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 it was found that the average annual death-rate among the\r\nBritish soldiers in India since the year 1817 had been 69 per 1000.\r\nTo-day it is little over 5 per 1000. The changes in barracks and\r\nmilitary sanitation in India, which are primarily accountable for this\r\ngreat saving of life, are directly traceable to the recommendations of\r\nthe Royal Commission which was appointed by Lord Stanley in 1859, and\r\nwhich reported in 1863. Thus much the reader may find stated in any\r\ntrustworthy book of reference or other standard authority. What he will\r\nnot find generally stated is that the appointment of the Royal\r\nCommission is directly traceable to Miss Nightingale, that by her the\r\ngreater part of its Report was written, and that the suggestions for\r\nreform founded upon it were also her work. At an International Congress\r\nheld in London in 1860 a French delegate, as already related, spoke of\r\nFlorence Nightingale as \"the Providence of the English Army.\" She was no\r\nless the Providence of the Indian Army. To the British soldier in India,\r\nas at home, she was \"a saviour.\" In introducing this subject, we must go\r\nback a little in point of time, for the Indian work had begun a few\r\nyears before the death of Sidney Herbert.\r\n\r\n  [8] Speech on Fox's East India Bill, Dec. 1, 1783 (_Burke's Speeches_,\r\n      1816, vol. ii. p. 430).\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I must tell you a secret,\" wrote Miss Nightingale to Harriet Martineau\r\nin 1859 (May 19), \"because I think it will please you. For eight long\r\nmonths I have been 'importunate-widowing' my 'unjust judge,' viz. Lord\r\nStanley, to give us a Royal Sanitary Commission to do exactly the same\r\nthing for the Armies in India which the last did for the Army at home.\r\nWe have just won it. The Queen has signed the Warrant. So it is safe.\r\nMr. Sidney Herbert is Chairman of course. Drs. Sutherland, Martin, Farr,\r\nand Alexander, whose names will be known to you, and Sir R. Vivian and\r\nSir P. Cautley, of the India Council, are on it.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale had made up her mind two years before to do this thing.\r\nThe Indian Mutiny, which filled some minds only with thoughts of\r\nvengeance and repression against the native soldiers, filled hers rather\r\nwith thoughts of pity and reform on behalf of the British soldiers. She\r\nhad gone into the figures of mortality in the Indian army at the time\r\nwhen she was analysing those in the army at home. There was \"murder\"\r\ncommitted not only by the Sepoys. It was murder also to doom British\r\nsoldiers to death by neglect of sanitary precautions. At the end of her\r\n_Notes on the Army_ (1857), she inserted a fly-leaf, which\r\nforeshadowed her Indian campaign:--\r\n\r\n     While the sheets were passing through the press, those lamentable\r\n     occurrences took place in India which have led to an universal\r\n     conviction that this vast Empire must henceforth be held by British\r\n     troops. If we were to be led by past experience of the presumed\r\n     effect of Indian climates on European constitutions, our country\r\n     might almost despair of being able to supply men enough.... The\r\n     British race has carried with it into those regions of the sun its\r\n     habits, its customs, and its vices, without considering that under\r\n     a low temperature man may do with impunity what under a higher one\r\n     is death. Our vast Indian Empire consists of many zones, of many\r\n     regions, of many climates. On the mere question of climate, it is\r\n     surely within human possibility, even in the great majority of\r\n     instances, so to arrange the stations, and so to connect them, by\r\n     railroads and telegraphs, that the troops would hardly be required\r\n     to occupy unhealthy districts. Even with regard to such districts\r\n     the question arises to what extent the unhealthiness is inevitable,\r\n     and to what extent it would be remediable.... As an illustration of\r\n     the necessity of Government interference in this matter, it may be\r\n     stated, on the very first authority, that, after a campaign perhaps\r\n     one of the most arduous and successful on record, and when the\r\n     smallness of the British force and the season of the year required\r\n     every sanitary precaution to be taken for the preservation of the\r\n     force, a certain earnest, energetic Officer appointed a sanitary\r\n     inspector to attend to the cleansing of a captured city, and to the\r\n     burial of some thousand dead bodies of men, horses, asses,\r\n     bullocks, camels, and elephants, which were poisoning the air. The\r\n     Bombay Government, to which the appointment was referred, \"would\r\n     not sanction it,\" \"_because there was no precedent for it_\"! In\r\n     future, it ought to be the duty of the Indian Government to require\r\n     no precedents for such procedure. The observance of Sanitary laws\r\n     should be as much part of the future _régime_ of India as the\r\n     holding of Military positions or as Civil government itself. It\r\n     would be a noble beginning of the new order of things to use\r\n     hygiene as the handmaid of civilization.\r\n\r\nEverything that Miss Nightingale thus said should be done, was done; and\r\nto the doing of it, she supplied, first, the propelling force, and,\r\nthen, much of the detailed direction.\r\n\r\nFirst came the movement for getting the appointment of a Royal\r\nCommission agreed to in principle. Miss Nightingale's reference to Lord\r\nStanley as her \"unjust judge\" need not be taken too seriously. He was\r\nher very good friend, as we know;[9] and it was when he was transferred\r\nfrom the Colonial to the India Office (1858) that she felt her time to\r\nhave come. And Lord Stanley agreed at once to her suggestion of\r\nappointing _a_ Commission. It was when the consideration of _the_\r\nCommission was reached that the delay began. Who should approach Lord\r\nStanley on the details? And how should it be done? Miss Nightingale and\r\nwhat I have called her cabinet of reformers were equally interested in\r\nthe Sub-Commissions still sitting on Army Sanitation at home. Lord\r\nStanley wanted Mr. Herbert to undertake the chairmanship of the India\r\nCommission. Should he accept it, at risk of diverting some of his\r\nattention from these other reforms? Miss Nightingale and her friends hit\r\nupon a plan, as she hoped, for killing two birds with one stone. It was\r\nintimated to Lord Stanley that Mr. Herbert would accept the chairmanship\r\non condition that the pending reforms at home were hastened. I do not\r\nknow if the Indian Secretary came to terms with the War Secretary in\r\nthat sense; if he did, I fear that General Peel interpreted \"haste\" as\r\n_festina lente_. Anyhow, Mr. Herbert accepted the chairmanship, and then\r\nsome months were spent in arranging the membership and the terms of\r\nreference. There were to be three sanitary experts, a statistician, and\r\ntwo members of the India Council. Of the two latter, one (Sir R. Vivian)\r\nwas a friend of Miss Nightingale's uncle, Mr. Smith; and of Sir Proby\r\nCautley she had heard good reports. The sanitarians--Drs. Sutherland,\r\nMartin, and Alexander--and Dr. Farr, the statistician, were all of her\r\ninner circle. At the last moment there was a fresh delay. The list was\r\nsubmitted for the royal approval, and Her Majesty required that \"a\r\nQueen's officer of acknowledged experience in India\" should be added to\r\nthe Commission. Mr. Herbert asked Miss Nightingale to supply a suitable\r\nman, by which he meant a man whose acknowledged experience included some\r\nbelief in sanitary science. She took great pains, and employed some wile\r\nin obtaining the best opinions. She wrote, for one thing, to her uncle,\r\ntelling him (May 19, 1859) to get at Sir John Lawrence, through his\r\nfriend Sir R. Vivian, and ask for suggestions. \"Vivian must be soaped,\"\r\nshe added, \"so as not to let him think that we undervalue _his_\r\nopinion.\" Sir John Lawrence did not, however, on this occasion prove\r\nvery resourceful; Miss Nightingale sent in the name of an officer,\r\nColonel E. H. Greathed, who had been commended to her through another\r\nchannel, and he was duly added to the Commission. At an earlier stage\r\nshe had thrown out the interesting suggestion that John Stuart Mill,\r\nlately retired from the East India House, should be asked to serve, but\r\nthis did not meet with favour. \"Our business,\" wrote one of her circle,\r\n\"is with spades and wheelbarrows,\" and he doubted whether \"Compte\" [sic]\r\ncould be put to such purposes. Miss Nightingale always thought that this\r\nally of hers, though invaluable in many ways, was a little wanting in\r\nsoul. So then the Commission was appointed. The Warrant was issued on\r\nMay 31, 1859. The Commission reported on May 19, 1863. There were some\r\nchanges in its personnel from death and other causes. On the overthrow\r\nof the Derby Government, Mr. Herbert went to the War Office, and he\r\npresently resigned the chairmanship. Lord Stanley succeeded him. The\r\nmembers of the Commission on whom both Mr. Herbert and Lord Stanley most\r\nrelied were Dr. Sutherland and Dr. Farr, and a third, who was yet not a\r\nmember--Miss Nightingale. And among these three the lion's share of the\r\nwork was done by her.\r\n\r\n  [9] See Vol. I. p. 339.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nShe had not waited for the actual appointment of the Commission to begin\r\ncollecting, preparing, and digesting evidence for it. Her first concern\r\nwas to draft a circular of inquiry which should be sent to all the\r\nStations in India. It lacked nothing, as will be supposed, in requiring\r\nfulness of statistical detail. When she had prepared it, she sent it in\r\nproof to Sir John McNeill for his suggestions, asking him also (May 9,\r\n1859) \"kindly to give an opinion as to the general direction which the\r\nEnquiry should take.\" In cases where she was personally acquainted with\r\nGovernors or high military or medical officers in India, she wrote\r\nsoliciting their good offices. Sir Charles Trevelyan, then Governor of\r\nMadras, promised cordial co-operation. Then she and Dr. Farr set to work\r\non such statistical records as were obtainable from the East India\r\nHouse. There is a bundle of correspondence amongst her Papers relating\r\nto the difficulties she encountered, and surmounted, in obtaining\r\nofficial sanction for clerical work in this regard. Dr. Farr's appetite\r\nfor statistics was as insatiable as hers, and she had taken means to lay\r\nin ample supplies:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Dr. Farr._) HIGHGATE, _June_ 2, [1859]. Your\r\n     Commission was gazetted on May 31 and Mr. Herbert is in town. As it\r\n     will be necessary to obtain the Statistics of Sickness, Mortality,\r\n     and Invaliding of the Indian Army from the Medical Boards there,\r\n     would not some of the proposed forms for the Army Medical Dep. be\r\n     better than any other, filled up for each station with the Diseases\r\n     annually for a period say of 10 years? Or would it be necessary to\r\n     provide others? We must, of course, have the most minute\r\n     Statistics--both for Soldiers and Officers in the Queen's,\r\n     Company's and native troops. And these we should get by this method\r\n     for 10 years. I suppose the Medical Boards have the Presidency\r\n     Medical Book Records. Would it be necessary to get the Returns for\r\n     each Corps separately? Would it not be important to get the\r\n     ages--age and time of service at Death or Invaliding?\r\n\r\n     HAMPSTEAD, _Dec._ 6 [1859]. In consequence of your intemperate\r\n     desire to have the Indian Medical Service Regulations, we have\r\n     applied at the Great House for copies. And the answer is that they\r\n     have only one Office copy, and if we want any we must send to\r\n     India. Knowing their weakness, we had (in our \"Queries\") previously\r\n     sent to two hundred Stations in India for copies of all\r\n     \"Regulations,\" and we hope the result will satisfy your literary\r\n     appetite.\r\n\r\nDr. Farr, then, was being fed with statistics. Officials in India were\r\nbeing kept busy with forms to be filled up, and with the preparation of\r\nother written evidence. In November 1859 the Commission began taking\r\noral evidence in London, but this was a comparatively minor part of its\r\nlabours, and during 1860 no public sittings were held. They were resumed\r\nin 1861. Lord Stanley had then succeeded Mr. Herbert in the chair, but\r\nMiss Nightingale's grip upon the Commission was not relaxed. Two of the\r\nCommissioners, Dr. Sutherland and Dr. Farr, were in close touch with\r\nher. The former was with her almost every day; the latter asked her to\r\nsend him questions which he should put to witnesses. As in the case of\r\nthe former Royal Commission, so now Miss Nightingale saw some of the\r\nwitnesses before they gave their evidence. Among her visitors in this\r\nsort was Sir John Lawrence, as already mentioned, and a friendship began\r\nwhich had important consequences. Seeing that everything was thus in\r\ngood train, Miss Nightingale was able during the years 1859-60-61 to\r\ndevote her main work to those other matters with which we have been\r\nconcerned in preceding Parts. In 1862, her main interest was in the\r\nIndian Commission, and the amount of work which she gave to it during\r\n1862-1863 was enormous.\r\n\r\nHer manner of life during these years was similar to that described in a\r\nprevious chapter. Work for the Commission required her constant\r\nattendance in London or within easy distance of it. In 1862 she lived\r\neither in a hotel (Peary's, 31 Dover Street), a hired house (9\r\nChesterfield Street), or Sir Harry Verney's house in South Street.\r\nDuring August and September she took a house in Oak Hill Park,\r\nHampstead. In 1863 she divided her time between Hampstead, hired houses\r\nin Cleveland Row, and Sir Harry Verney's. Her affectionate friend,\r\nMrs. Sutherland, did all the house-hunting for her. Cleveland Row was\r\nselected for its nearness to the War Office; and the convenience of the\r\nsite so far constrained Dr. Sutherland's sanitary conscience that he\r\ndeclared Cleveland Row to be \"the airiest place in London.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nFew of my readers have come to close quarters, I suppose, with the\r\n_Indian Sanitary Commission's Report_. It is a very formidable thing,\r\nconsisting of two bulky volumes, containing respectively 1069 and 959\r\npages--in all 2028 pages, mostly in small print. Of this mountainous\r\nmass, the greater part bears in one way or another the impress of Miss\r\nNightingale. It was she, in the first place, as already stated, who\r\ndrafted the questions which were sent to every military station in\r\nIndia. The replies, signed in each case by the commanding officer, the\r\nengineer officer, and the medical officer, occupy the whole of the\r\nsecond volume. The replies, as they came in from India, were sent to her\r\nto analyse. There were van-loads of them, she said, which cost her\r\n£4:10s. to move whenever she changed houses. With the analysis made by\r\nher and Dr. Sutherland, these replies anticipated, as she afterwards\r\nnoted,[10] the Statistical Survey of India which Lord Mayo ordered ten\r\nyears later. It was said at the time that such a complete picture of\r\nlife in India, both British and native, was contained in no other book\r\nin existence. In October 1861 she was formally requested by the\r\nCommission to submit remarks on these Stational Reports. She had\r\ncompleted the task by August 1862. The \"Observations by Miss\r\nNightingale,\" which occupy twenty-three pages of the Report, are among\r\nthe most remarkable of her Works, and in their results among the most\r\nbeneficent. They are also extremely readable; and to make them more\r\ninstructive, she included a number of woodcuts illustrating, not only\r\nIndian hospitals and barracks, but native customs in connection with\r\nwater-supply and drainage.[11] The Treasury--horrified perhaps at the\r\nidea of popularizing a Blue-book--made some demur to the cost, but Miss\r\nNightingale was allowed to solve the difficulty by paying for the\r\nprinting, as well as for the illustrations, out of her private purse.\r\n\r\n  [10] In her _marginalia_ to Sir William Hunter's _Earl of Mayo_ (1891).\r\n\r\n  [11] Indian officers (and especially Colonel Young) supplied her with\r\n       sketches, some of which were touched up by her cousin, Miss Hilary\r\n       Bonham Carter.\r\n\r\nShe made full use of the opening which the niggardliness of the Treasury\r\ngave her. She hurried the printers, and had a large number of her\r\n\"Observations\" struck off for private use. \"I have looked once more,\"\r\nwrote Lord Stanley (Nov. 21), \"through your Remarks, and like them\r\nbetter the oftener I read them. The style alone (apart from the\r\nauthority which your name carries with it) will ensure their being\r\nstudied by many who know nothing of the subject. They will admirably\r\nrelieve the dryness of our official Report. I hope every Indian and\r\nEnglish newspaper will reprint them, in extracts at least. They must be\r\ncirculated with our Report, separately from the too voluminous mass of\r\nevidence which we can't help appending. You have added one more to your\r\nmany and invaluable services in the cause.\" \"Miss Nightingale's Paper,\"\r\nwrote Dr. Farr to Dr. Sutherland (Dec. 1), \"is a masterpiece, in her\r\nbest style; and will rile the enemy very considerable--all for his good,\r\npoor creature.\"[12] But it was not only among the Commissioners that she\r\ncirculated her Paper. She sent it confidentially to many of her\r\ninfluential friends. \"The picture is terrible,\" wrote Sir John McNeill\r\n(Aug. 9), \"but it is all true. There is no one statement from beginning\r\nto end that I feel disposed to question, and there are many which my own\r\nobservation and experience enable me to confirm.\" A copy went to John\r\nStuart Mill, who was much pleased with the \"Observations,\" and was\r\ncertain that \"the publication of them would do vast good.\" Miss\r\nNightingale had a copy bound for the Queen, and sent it--as also a copy\r\nof her Paper on Sidney Herbert--through Sir James Clark, who marked\r\npassages for the Queen to read. Her Majesty, he found from conversation,\r\nhad not confined her reading to those passages. The Queen in return sent\r\na copy of her Collection of Prince Albert's Speeches. \"The Queen,\" wrote\r\nMiss Nightingale to M. Mohl (Feb. 14, 1863), \"has sent me her book with\r\nsuch a touching inscription. She always reminds me of the Greek chorus\r\nwith her hands clasped above her head wailing out her irrepressible\r\ndespair.\"[13] Miss Nightingale sent her \"Observations\" also to Sir John\r\nLawrence, who studied them closely, and corresponded with her on the\r\nsubject. Another copy went to Sir Charles Trevelyan.[14] \"Having,\" he\r\nwrote (Oct. 31, 1862), \"undertaken the duties of Financial Member of the\r\nCouncil of India, I may now be able to give some help in carrying the\r\nrecommendations of your Commission into practical effect. You must not\r\nexpect from me as much as Sidney Herbert did, for my power will not be\r\nthe same. The Governor-General and the local Governors will alone be in\r\nthat position. But I shall do _what I can_. Perhaps you will send me a\r\ncopy of your Abstract of the Evidence, and direct my attention to the\r\npoints of more immediate importance. I shall be obliged for any hints.\"\r\nMiss Nightingale responded by sending him papers enough to occupy all\r\nhis time on the voyage. She seems at this time to have entertained some\r\nhope that her health would permit her, when the Report was out, to visit\r\nIndia in person; for one of Sir Charles's letters refers to such a\r\nvisit, and expresses the pleasure which it would give to Lady Trevelyan\r\nand himself to receive her as their guest, and in every way to assist\r\nher mission. But this was not to be. Her knowledge of India and Indian\r\nquestions was already great, and presently it became so minute as to\r\nencourage a legend that she herself had once been there.[15] But she\r\nnever saw the country. It is not always either the \"life-long resident,\"\r\nor, on the other hand, \"Padgett, M.P.,\" who is better qualified than the\r\nstudent to perceive and serve a country's need.\r\n\r\n  [12] A true prediction: see Sir Bartle Frere's saying, below, p. 158.\r\n\r\n  [13] The inscription is: \"To Miss Florence Nightingale in recollection\r\n       of the greatest and best of Princes from the beloved Prince's\r\n       broken-hearted Widow, Victoria R. Osborne, Jan. 13, 1863.\"\r\n\r\n  [14] He had been recalled from Madras in 1860.\r\n\r\n  [15] \"It will be remembered that Miss Florence Nightingale came to this\r\n       country and was impressed with the idea that if India needed\r\n       anything it was village sanitation. She collected a mass of facts\r\n       and has since been agitating in England\": _Amrita Bazar Patrika_\r\n       (Calcutta), June 29, 1892, reprinted in the _Indian Spectator_,\r\n       July 10.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's \"Observations\" form a synopsis of the whole subject.\r\nGiving chapter and verse from the Stational reports for each of her\r\nstatements, she shows, first, that the prevailing diseases were camp\r\ndiseases such as she had seen in the Crimean War--largely due to the\r\nselection of unsuitable sites. Among the causes were Bad Water, Bad\r\nDrainage, Filthy Bazaars, Want of Ventilation, and Surface Overcrowding\r\nin barrack-huts and sick-wards. Her remarks under these several heads\r\nare often characteristically racy. \"Where tests have been used, the\r\ncomposition of the water reads like a very intricate prescription,\r\ncontaining nearly all the chlorides, sulphates, nitrates, and carbonates\r\nin the pharmacopoeia, besides silica and quantities of animal and\r\nvegetable matter, which the reports apparently consider nutritive.\" \"If\r\nthe facilities for washing were as great as those for drink, our Indian\r\narmy would be the cleanest body of men in the world.\" \"There is no\r\ndrainage, in any sense in which we understand the word. The reports\r\nspeak of cesspits as if they were dressingrooms.\" \"Except where the two\r\nLawrences have been--there one can always recognize their traces--the\r\nbazaars are simply in the first savage stage of social savage life.\"\r\nUnder the head of \"Overcrowding,\" she brings together various instances\r\nwith figures and woodcuts; she quotes one report which said that the men\r\n(300 men per room!) \"are generally accommodated in the barrack without\r\ninconvenient overcrowding,\" and she asks, \"What is _convenient_\r\novercrowding?\" \"At some stations the floors are of earth, varnished over\r\nperiodically with cow-dung: a practice borrowed from the natives. Like\r\nMahomet and the mountain, if men won't go to the dunghill, the dunghill,\r\nit appears, comes to them.\" Her next section, on \"Intemperance,\" is\r\nscathing. In India, as at home,[16] it was a current opinion of the time\r\nthat the soldier is by nature a drunken animal; the only question seemed\r\nto be as to how he had better get drunk. At one station, though the men\r\nwere reported as \"mostly temperate,\" she found that on a ten years'\r\naverage one man in three was admitted into hospital directly from drink.\r\n\"The men are killed by liver disease on canteen spirits to save them\r\nfrom being killed by liver disease on bazaar spirits. May there not be\r\nsome middle course whereby the men may be killed by neither?\" Under\r\n\"Diet,\" she notes the absurdity of a uniform ration, in amount and\r\nquality, in all seasons and climates; and ventures to doubt whether\r\ncesspits are desirable adjuncts of kitchens. Her next head is \"Want of\r\nOccupation and Exercise\"--a fruitful source of vice and disease. It is a\r\nmost interesting chapter, full of valuable hints and illustrated by an\r\namusing drawing, sent to her by Colonel Young, of \"Daily Means of\r\nOccupation and Amusement _passim_.\" Here, as in much else of Miss\r\nNightingale's work, she collected all the better opinions; she picked\r\nout from the returns before her any hopeful experiments; enlarged upon\r\nthem, and drove the moral home. Her chapter on \"Indian Hospitals\" is\r\nnaturally very full and detailed. She discusses the prevalent structural\r\ndefects; suggests improvements in the internal arrangements; and notes\r\nthat there were \"neither trained orderlies nor female nurses.\" On the\r\nsubject of \"Hill Stations,\" Miss Nightingale's \"Observations\" show a\r\nfear lest too much reliance should be placed upon their superior\r\nsalubrity. She quotes instances of terrible sanitary defects on hill\r\nstations, and enforces the moral that \"the salvation of the Indian army\r\nmust be brought about by sanitary measures everywhere.\" After discussing\r\n\"Native Towns,\" \"Soldiers' Wives,\" and \"Statistics,\" Miss Nightingale\r\ninsisted generally on the importance of instituting a proper system of\r\nsanitary service in India. Henceforth, to the end almost of her long\r\nlife, she regarded herself, and in large measure was able to act, as a\r\nsanitary servant to the army and peoples of India.\r\n\r\n  [16] See Vol. I. p. 277.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's \"Observations\" were only part of her share in the\r\nlabours of the Commission. They were followed in the Report by an\r\nAbstract, arranged under Presidencies, of the Returns on which the\r\n\"Observations\" were founded. This analysis, occupying nearly a hundred\r\npages, was drawn up, as already stated, by Miss Nightingale and Dr.\r\nSutherland. The manuscript of it, preserved amongst her papers, is\r\nmainly in her handwriting. And she did much more, as will presently be\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nWhen the Commission of the Army in India was nearing the end of its\r\nlabours, an event happened which seemed to Miss Nightingale of crucial\r\nimportance. On April 14, 1863, she heard from Sir Harry Verney that Sir\r\nGeorge Lewis, the Secretary for War, had died suddenly on the previous\r\nday. Sir Harry added that at the Service Clubs, Lord de Grey was talked\r\nof as a probable successor, but that Lord Panmure's name was also\r\nmentioned. From another and a better-informed source she heard that Lord\r\nde Grey hoped to get the appointment, but that there were believed to be\r\ntwo difficulties in the way. The Queen might object to the War Office\r\nbeing given to a Minister who had not yet been in the Cabinet, and\r\npressure might be put upon Lord Palmerston from other quarters not to\r\nappoint a Peer. Should either or both of these factors prevail,\r\nMr. Cardwell was believed to be the most probable successor. Now it\r\nseemed to Miss Nightingale all-important that, when the Report on the\r\nhealth of the army in India came out, the Secretary of State for War\r\nshould be a proved sanitarian. She did not want to have once more to\r\n\"bully the Bison,\" and she did not know much of Mr. Cardwell. She did\r\nknow Lord de Grey, and she knew him as a sympathiser in her cause.\r\nWithout a moment's delay she set herself to bring to bear in his favour\r\nsuch influence as she might possess, either on her own account or as the\r\npublic legatee, as it were, of Sidney Herbert. A telegram written _en\r\nclair_ and preserved by the recipient shows how a good press was secured\r\nfor Lord de Grey's appointment:--\r\n\r\n     _From_ Florence Nightingale to Harriet Martineau.--Agitate,\r\n     agitate, for Lord de Grey to succeed Sir George Lewis.\r\n\r\nThe world was duly informed next day (April 17) through the columns of\r\nthe _Daily News_ that public opinion expected the appointment of Lord de\r\nGrey. But Miss Nightingale took other measures. She wrote a letter to\r\nLord Palmerston, and to his principal colleague, Mr. Gladstone, she sent\r\na copy of it. Mr. Gladstone, in reply, did not doubt that Lord\r\nPalmerston had a very high opinion of Lord de Grey, but added on his own\r\npart that he saw great difficulty in not having the head of the War\r\nOffice, with its vast expenditure, in the House of Commons. The letter\r\nto Lord Palmerston, meanwhile, was delivered by a special messenger, who\r\nhad been strictly charged to make sure that the Minister read it at\r\nonce. The sequel, describing a somewhat curious scene, had better be\r\ngiven in Sir Harry Verney's own words:--\r\n\r\n     CLEVELAND ROW, _Ap._ 15 [2.30]. From Hampstead I returned to South\r\n     Street, and found your letter. Thence to Cambridge House. Lord\r\n     Palmerston was so good as to admit me. I said that I had seen you\r\n     this morning, and that by your desire I requested him to allow me\r\n     to read a letter to him from you. He said, \"Certainly\"; and I read\r\n     it to him rather slowly. Having read it, I said that you had\r\n     mentioned this morning that within a fortnight of Lord Herbert's\r\n     death, he had said to you more than once that he hoped Lord de Grey\r\n     might be his successor. I then added, \"I have not to request any\r\n     reply or observations on Miss Nightingale's letter. I have only to\r\n     thank you for your kindness in allowing me to read it.\" He took\r\n     the letter and put it in his pocket. He then asked how you are,\r\n     and where, and I told him. There is a Cabinet at 5.30 this\r\n     afternoon. I think that if Gladstone has your note before going to\r\n     it, it might be well.\r\n\r\nShe had anticipated Sir Harry's suggestion, as we have seen. The Prime\r\nMinister put her letter into his pocket, but it did not stay there. He\r\ntook it with him to Windsor and read it to the Queen. On April 22 it was\r\nannounced that Her Majesty had been pleased to approve the appointment\r\nof Lord de Grey as Secretary of State for War.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale thus felt assured that when the Indian Report came out\r\nshe would have a sympathetic chief at the War Office, and she turned\r\nwith the greater zest to the next stage in her labours; namely, the\r\npreparation of the Report by the Commissioners. The manuscript of the\r\nfirst page or two (explaining the delay in issuing the Report and the\r\nprocedure of the Commission) is in Lord Stanley's handwriting (preserved\r\namong Miss Nightingale's papers). He entrusted the preparation of the\r\nfirst draft of the rest of the Report, for statistics to Dr. Farr, and\r\nfor the rest to Miss Nightingale and Dr. Sutherland. She had written a\r\nfirst draft of the greater part of her sections of the Report as early\r\nas April 1862. By August it was in type and corrected by Lord Stanley,\r\nwho \"pledged himself to carry it through the Commission next month.\"[17]\r\nBut Dr. Farr's section was not so far advanced, and there were other\r\ndelays at which Miss Nightingale chafed not a little. In May 1863 the\r\nlast stage was reached. \"I have done and shall do all in my power,\" Lord\r\nStanley wrote to her (July 10), \"to make it public that to Dr.\r\nSutherland and you we mainly owe it that the Report has assumed its\r\npresent shape.\" Among her papers is a collection of proofs of the Report\r\nin various stages; some corrected by Dr. Farr and Dr. Sutherland, others\r\ncorrected and re-corrected by her. The descriptive portion of the Report\r\nis in substance a repetition of her \"Observations,\" in the colder\r\nlanguage which is held to add weight and dignity to such documents;\r\nthough here and there Miss Nightingale's touch may be felt. The\r\nmagnitude of the evils which needed to be remedied is put in an\r\narresting way. \"Besides deaths from natural causes [9 per 1000], 60 head\r\nper 1000 of our troops perish annually in India. It is at that expense\r\nthat we have held dominion there for a century; a company out of every\r\nregiment has been sacrificed every twenty months. These companies fade\r\naway in the prime of life; leave few children; and have to be replaced,\r\nat great cost, by successive shiploads of recruits.\" The cost of\r\npreventable sickness in the Indian army was calculated at £388,000 a\r\nyear. The list of Recommendations with which the Report concludes may be\r\ndescribed as a Sanitary Charter for the Army in India--a Charter which\r\nduring many successive years was gradually put into force.\r\n\r\n  [17] Letter to Sir J. McNeill, Aug. 8, 1862.\r\n\r\nLast of all came what Miss Nightingale considered the most vital point\r\nof all--namely, the suggestion of practical machinery by which, if the\r\nGovernment adopted it, the recommendations of the Commission might be\r\ncarried out. At this crucial point, she had a very stiff fight. The\r\nmachinery, as she had devised it, was to be twofold. First, there were\r\nto be Sanitary Commissions appointed for each Presidency in India. On\r\nthis point, all the Commissioners seem to have been agreed; but it was\r\ndifferent with Miss Nightingale's second point. The reports which she\r\nhad read and marked from the Indian stations filled her with a fear that\r\nif the whole of the initiative were left to India the work would in some\r\ncases be negligently or unintelligently done. There had not yet been in\r\nthat country the same education of public opinion amongst the governing\r\nclass in the science of sanitation that had been in progress in England.\r\nShe deemed it essential that the machinery recommended by the Commission\r\nshould in one way or another include provision to secure for India the\r\nexperience already obtained in dealing with all kinds of sanitary\r\nquestions in England. She had formulated her own plans to this end at an\r\nearly stage of the Commission. What she first suggested was a Sanitary\r\nDepartment at the India Office, and this, as we shall hear in a later\r\nchapter (p. 153), was ultimately established. It had been well if the\r\nsuggestion had been accepted from the beginning, for the compromise\r\nwhich was substituted led to some confused friction between the War\r\nOffice and the India Office. As the second-best plan, Miss Nightingale\r\nwanted the standing Sanitary Committee at the War Office,[18] reinforced\r\nby one or two representatives of India, to be invested with authority\r\nover Indian sanitation, and she wanted, secondly, a Sanitary Code to be\r\nissued for India by the Home Government. She had named the two Indian\r\nofficials, and had urged the addition of Mr. Rawlinson, at that time the\r\nleading sanitary engineer in England.[19] But on all this there was some\r\ndifference of opinion. She was kept informed from day to day of the\r\ncurrents of thought among the Commissioners, and of the course of the\r\ndiscussions. The letters, minutes, memoranda in which she urged her\r\nviews are many. She had first to persuade Lord Stanley, and this in\r\npersonal interviews she succeeded in doing. She begged him to open the\r\nsubject to Sir Charles Wood, the Secretary for India, who did not take\r\nthe suggestion amiss. There were still, however, some contrary opinions,\r\nbut ultimately her policy prevailed. \"I cannot help telling you, in the\r\njoy of my heart,\" she wrote to Harriet Martineau (May 19), \"that the\r\nfinal meeting of the Indian Sanitary Commission was held to-day--that\r\nthe Report was signed--and that after a very tough battle, lasting three\r\ndays, to convince these people that a Report was not self-executive, our\r\nWorking Commission was carried, not quite in the original form proposed,\r\nbut in what may prove a better working form because grafted on what\r\nexists. This is the dawn of a new day for India in sanitary things, not\r\nonly as regards our Army, but as regards the native population.\" But\r\nMiss Nightingale was never content to let the light steal in gradually;\r\nshe wanted to secure for the Report of the Commission the fullest\r\npossible glare of publicity.\r\n\r\n  [18] The Barrack and Hospital Commission, re-named the Army Sanitary\r\n       Committee in 1865; see p. 65.\r\n\r\n  [19] Her nominations were, in the end, all approved. The Indian\r\n       representatives were Sir Proby Cautley and Sir James Ranald Martin.\r\n\r\nHer first concern was to get early notices of the Report in the\r\nnewspapers. The daring, the celerity, the energy of her moves might\r\nexcite the admiration even of the greatest experts in this sort of our\r\nown day. The gist of the Report, so far as its statement of the facts\r\nwas concerned, was contained in her own \"Observations\"; and, as\r\nexplained above, she had already circulated these both in India and at\r\nhome. Having thus, as it were, salted the ground, she prepared for the\r\nofficial publication. As one of the principal authors of the Report, she\r\nwas obviously entitled to some copies. She obtained a note from Lord\r\nStanley, the Chairman, to that effect. The Queen's printer,\r\nMr. Spottiswoode, was her very good friend, having been associated with\r\nher in more than one philanthropic enterprise, and, after seeing Lord\r\nStanley's note, he promised to use every expedition and to let Miss\r\nNightingale have some of the very earliest copies. She sent them off\r\nimmediately; to various influential friends (Sir John Lawrence among the\r\nnumber), but principally to writers for the press; and with regard to\r\nthese latter, there was no reason why she should tell each recipient of\r\nthe special early copy that he was not the only individual so favoured.\r\nA Blue-book of 2028 pages is not mastered in a minute, and people\r\nwondered how so many of the newspapers and magazines were able to notice\r\nthe Report so fully on the instant. \"Mr. Baker [the Clerk to the\r\nCommission] has regained his equanimity,\" wrote the printer (July 23);\r\n\"but for three days he could not recover the shock of your rapid\r\naction.\" Miss Nightingale's celerity may well have seemed indecent to\r\nthe leisurely official mind; for six months were allowed to pass before\r\nthe Government of India was officially provided with copies of the\r\nReport! This delay may seem incredible to those not well versed in such\r\naffairs, but it is recorded in a Government Dispatch,[20] and an\r\ninvestigation made by Miss Nightingale into another delay of a like kind\r\nmay perhaps afford an explanation.[21] Meanwhile, in July 1863, she\r\nhad, for some days previous to the issue of the Report, been arranging\r\nfor reviews in newspapers and magazines, in Edinburgh and Dublin as well\r\nas in London. Mr. W. R. Greg was especially helpful; he contributed\r\nnotices to three important periodicals--the _Economist_, the _National\r\nReview_, and the _Spectator_. Miss Nightingale was diligent also in\r\ncoaching Harriet Martineau, writing at great length to explain the\r\npoints on which public opinion might most usefully declare itself. Miss\r\nMartineau wrote on the Report in the _Daily News_, _Macmillan's\r\nMagazine_, and _Once a Week_; and on her own part she had a contribution\r\nto make to the cause. She was an old friend of Lord and Lady Elgin.\r\nShould she write to them? The indefatigable Miss Nightingale at once\r\nsent her the heads of a letter on the subject which should go\r\nimmediately to the Viceroy.\r\n\r\n  [20] \"On the 5th February 1864, the Government of India informed the\r\n       Secretary of State that, in consequence of the non-arrival of the\r\n       Report of the Royal Commission, it had not been possible to carry\r\n       out the measures indicated in the despatch of the 15th August, but\r\n       that having just received a few copies, &c., &c.\" (_Memorandum on\r\n       Measures adopted for Sanitary Improvements in India up to the end\r\n       of 1867_, p. 2).\r\n\r\n  [21] See below, p. 49 _n._\r\n\r\nThough Miss Nightingale attached importance to notices in the press, she\r\nwas equally eager that the Report itself should attract the attention of\r\ninfluential individuals in and out of Parliament. And here at the outset\r\nshe met with a severe check which, however, by her energy and resource\r\nwas turned to the greater advantage of the cause. The Blue-books were of\r\nenormous bulk, and a smaller edition had been prepared, apparently by\r\nthe Clerk. Owing to what was officially described as \"a mistake,\" it was\r\nthis smaller edition that was \"presented to both Houses of Parliament by\r\ncommand.\" It alone was placed on sale to the public; the 1000 copies of\r\nthe complete work (of which the printer had been ordered to break up the\r\ntype) were reserved for the press and for official purposes. They could\r\nbe obtained (on application) by members of Parliament, but were not\r\naccessible to the public. The smaller edition, which the officials\r\ndesigned for public use, did not contain Miss Nightingale's\r\n\"Observations\" (though these were referred to in the Report) and did not\r\ncontain the evidence from the Indian Stations. It gave instead a \"précis\r\nof evidence\" made by the Clerk. This, as Miss Nightingale thought, was\r\nbadly done, and, moreover, referred in the margin to passages which\r\nagain were not accessible to the public. Miss Nightingale was naturally\r\nand justly indignant at a proceeding which thus left the\r\nrecommendations of the Commission unsupported, so far as the public were\r\nconcerned, by the essential facts. She set herself with characteristic\r\nenergy to rectify the official \"mistake,\" or, as she suspected, to\r\ncircumvent the design. If indeed there were any intention to withhold\r\nfrom the public eye the full extent of the terrible state of things in\r\nIndia, the authors of the design had counted without the formidable\r\nLady-in-Chief. As for the partial suppression of her own \"Observations,\"\r\nthat was easily rectified. Dr. Sutherland and Dr. Farr, incensed at the\r\ntreatment which she had received, promptly made arrangements with a\r\npublisher for the separate issue of her \"Observations.\"[22] This little\r\n\"red book\" had a large sale, and was widely reviewed in the press.\r\nThereby the subject received a second series of notices. \"It is not a\r\nbook,\" said one of the reviewers, \"but a great action.\" But Miss\r\nNightingale herself was more concerned with the wide circulation of the\r\nBlue-books themselves. First, she wrote round to every member of\r\nParliament whom she knew, informing them of the facts and begging them\r\nto apply for the unmutilated edition. One of the answers she received\r\nwas from Lord Shaftesbury (Aug. 22): \"I will immediately apply for the\r\ncopy of evidence you mention, but ought we not to insist when Parliament\r\nmeets that it be fully circulated like any other document? Sir C. Wood\r\nmay have made a 'mistake,' but a far greater mistake would be to bury\r\nthis important matter in the 'tomb of all the Capulets.' ... You have\r\nachieved very grand things; and you must thank God that He has called\r\nyou to such a work, and has so blessed it. I have much to talk to you\r\nabout.\"[23] Secondly, she extracted a promise that inquirers at\r\nHansard's office should be informed that copies of the unmutilated\r\nedition could be obtained by the public on application at the Burial\r\nBoard Office.[24] She took very good care that they should not be buried\r\nthere. She prompted all sorts and conditions of persons among her\r\nacquaintances to apply, and there was a run on the book. Next, and\r\nchiefly, she was anxious that the essential parts of the Report should\r\ncome under the notice of every officer and every official in India who\r\nwas in any degree responsible for the health of the army and who might\r\nbe brought by a knowledge of the facts to further the cause of sanitary\r\nreform. The way in which she achieved her purpose was characteristic.\r\nMiss Nightingale had a personal grievance in this matter; and she used\r\nit, as on a previous occasion she had used her personal prestige, to\r\ngain a public end. To an intimate friend in the War Office, she was\r\ndownright: \"Done in some way or other, I am determined it shall be.\" But\r\nto the great men above him, she was suave--insidiously and dangerously\r\nsuave. She entirely agreed that it would be expensive to reprint, and\r\nabsurd to circulate widely, two enormous Blue-books of 2028 pages.\r\nNobody would read them. But on the other hand was it not a little unfair\r\nto her to circulate an abridged edition, from which was excluded all the\r\nmaterial upon which, at the request of the Commission, she had spent\r\nyears of labour? But what was to be done? She knew how busy all\r\nGovernment officials were; but she would willingly undertake the task of\r\nputting together an amended edition of the smaller issue. Would the\r\nTreasury object to the cost? If so, she would bear it. In one way and\r\nanother, she said, she had spent £700 in connection with the former\r\nReport on the British Army; the cost of similar work in connection with\r\nIndia would be less, and she would gladly defray it. Lord de Grey\r\nauthorized her to proceed on August 26, and for the next three months\r\nshe was busy in preparing the Report in the form in which it was to be\r\ncirculated among military and medical officers.[25] But she was not\r\nquite satisfied yet. She had provided means for bringing her horses to\r\nwater, but who was to make them drink? Her amended report was to be\r\ncirculated amongst the Army in India, but would it be read? She was\r\nafraid not, unless the Secretary of State specially commended it to the\r\nattention of his subordinates. Did the War Office shrink from taking\r\ninitiative in a matter which also concerned the India Office? \"But\r\nsurely Sir Charles Wood will be very grateful to you for remedying his\r\nmistake.\" The Minister assented, and a preface was added to Miss\r\nNightingale's edition of the Report, in which the Secretary for War\r\nexplained that it was circulated \"with a view of affording information\r\non the subject to Commanding, Engineering, and Medical Officers.\" Of\r\ncourse there were official delays, and this edition of the Report was\r\nnot issued till August 1864, but it gave Miss Nightingale opportunity of\r\norganizing yet another press crusade. Through Sidney Herbert's friend,\r\nCount Strzelechi, who was also a friend of Delane, she was able to\r\nsecure a series of articles in the _Times_ on the sanitary needs of\r\nIndia.[26] The Count was very proud of what he had been able to do for\r\nher. None of Miss Nightingale's official works obtained a wider\r\ncirculation than the \"Observations\"; nor, I suppose, did any Blue-book\r\non such a subject ever attain a greater amount of publicity.\r\n\r\n  [22] Bibliography A, No. 34.\r\n\r\n  [23] Miss Nightingale's letter to Lord Shaftesbury is printed in his\r\n       _Life_, p. 581.\r\n\r\n  [24] This was not designedly a practical joke. The Clerk to the\r\n       Commission held a post in the Board.\r\n\r\n  [25] See Bibliography A, No, 33 (3).\r\n\r\n  [26] A leading article appeared on August 23, introducing a series of\r\n       \"special articles\" which began on the following day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nBut all this was only a preliminary. Public attention had been aroused,\r\nand every one said vaguely that something must be done. It remained for\r\nGovernment to do it. The steps which Miss Nightingale took to this end,\r\nthe obstacles which she encountered, the measure of success which she\r\nattained, will be described in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nThe work, which has been described in foregoing pages and which Miss\r\nNightingale continued during the following year, was very heavy, and it\r\nwas all done under grievous physical disability. In 1857-58, when she\r\nwas doing like work in connection with the Royal Commission on the Home\r\nArmy, though she was in very delicate health, she had yet been able to\r\nmove about. When Sidney Herbert could not come to see her, she could go\r\nto see him. But now in 1863, when work for the Commission on the Indian\r\nArmy was at its height, she was bedridden. When she invited a nursing\r\nfriend to her house, the formula was \"Will you come and spend Saturday\r\nto Monday in bed with me?\" She could only receive her visitors, if at\r\nall, in her own room, and all her writing was done in bed. She was\r\nsustained through these disabilities partly, it may be, by the\r\nconsciousness of power and by satisfaction in its exercise, but\r\nprincipally by passionate devotion to her cause. And there was another\r\nfeeling which gave her strength, as appears from many a passage in her\r\nprivate letters. She was carrying out, as best she could alone, the\r\n\"joint work\" which had been left \"unfinished\" at Sidney Herbert's death.\r\n\"There is no feeling more sustaining,\" Sir John McNeill had said to her,\r\nwhen Arthur Clough was also taken from her, \"than that of being alone.\"\r\nSo, in some sort, I think, she found it. And sometimes, as to one who\r\nstretches out his hands in yearning for the further shore, there seemed\r\nto come to her voices of encouragement. \"I heard the other day,\" she\r\nsaid in 1863, \"of two Englishmen who were nearly lost by being caught by\r\nthe tide on the coast of France, and a little French fisher-girl ran all\r\nalong the wet sands to show them the only rock, half a mile from the\r\nshore, which the tide did not cover, where of course she was obliged to\r\nstay with them. It got quite dark, the water rose above their knees, but\r\npresently they heard a sound, faint and far off, and the little girl\r\nsaid, 'They think the tide is turning, they are shouting to cheer us!' I\r\noften think I hear those on the far-off shore who are shouting to cheer\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                         SETTING REFORMERS TO WORK\r\n\r\n                                (1863-1865)\r\n\r\n\r\n     I am more hopeful than you appear to be in regard to the good\r\n     likely to be effected by the Report. Although our Indian\r\n     administration has great difficulties to contend with owing to the\r\n     nature of the country and the people, it is both honest and able;\r\n     and I never knew a public measure, the advantage of which was\r\n     generally admitted, which ultimately was not properly taken in\r\n     hand.--SIR CHARLES TREVELYAN (_Letter to Florence Nightingale_,\r\n     Aug. 24, 1862).\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we traced Miss Nightingale's hand throughout the\r\nfamous Report of the Indian Sanitary Commission. We saw how she worked\r\nfor the inclusion, in the Commissioners' recommendations, of machinery\r\nfor getting the other recommendations adopted; we saw, too, how cleverly\r\nshe man[oe]uvred to obtain wide publicity and discussion for the whole\r\nsubject. But this was not enough for her. She had created a favourable\r\natmosphere; she had provided suitable machinery; it remained to set the\r\nwheels going round. \"Reports are not self-executive\": she applied her\r\nwords in this fresh direction; and, as in the case of the Home\r\nCommission five years before, so now she gave not a moment's rest to\r\nherself or to anybody else whom she could influence until reforms,\r\nrecommended by the Report, were set on foot.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was as eager, in as great a hurry to begin, as\r\ndetermined to have her way, as before; but the difficulties were now\r\ngreater. In the case of the Home Army, only one department (though that,\r\nto be sure, was a dual one) was concerned; in the case of Sanitary\r\nmeasures for the Army in India, there were the India Office and the\r\nGovernment of India to be considered as well as the War Office. And\r\neverybody, who knows anything about public affairs, knows what it means\r\nto the cause of prompt efficiency if departments begin wrangling with\r\neach other. And then Miss Nightingale had no longer her \"dear master.\"\r\nLord Stanley, the Chairman of the Indian Commission, was friendly, and\r\nsincerely desirous to see things done; but he was not an enthusiast. His\r\ntemperament was cool; his judgment, critical. But, as I have already\r\nsaid, he had a great belief in Miss Nightingale, and though she did not\r\nalways find him an easy man to drive, she did it. The moment the Report\r\nwas signed she was up and at him. He must do as Sidney Herbert did; that\r\nis, go at once to Ministers and insist on immediate steps being taken to\r\nput the recommendations of the Report into operation. Otherwise, all\r\ntheir labour might dissolve in air. Lord Stanley proposed to wait and\r\nsee:--\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Stanley to Miss Nightingale._) _July_ 10, 1863. ... Do not\r\n     fear that Lord Herbert's work will be left unfinished: sanitary\r\n     ideas have taken root in the public mind, and they cannot be\r\n     treated as visionary. The test of experience is conclusive. The\r\n     ground that has been gained cannot be lost again.----_July_ 12....\r\n     The first step is to ask what the War and India departments will\r\n     do. If on consideration they consent to the appointment of the\r\n     commissions recommended with or without modification of our plan,\r\n     the thing is fairly started. I am inclined to believe that they\r\n     will be found willing. But we must give them time to read the\r\n     report. If they object to do anything, other methods may be tried.\r\n     We have friends in the Indian Council, and Lord de Grey is a\r\n     Sanitarist. I quite agree in what you say as to its being a duty to\r\n     help the ministry of the day in working out their plans.\r\n     Practically I have acted on this rule. Few matters pass in the\r\n     India Office that do not come before me. But such help cannot be\r\n     offered by an outsider--it must be asked by those who are\r\n     responsible. If Sir C. Wood desires assistance in giving effect to\r\n     the sanitary projects, I will not refuse it. There is ample time to\r\n     consider all this.\r\n\r\nSo Lord Stanley was waiting to be asked. Then it became Miss\r\nNightingale's business to contrive that he should be asked. She saw Lord\r\nde Grey, begged him to go forthwith to the India Office, and to suggest\r\nto Sir Charles Wood that he should talk matters over with Lord Stanley.\r\nThe thing was done:--\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Stanley to Miss Nightingale._) _July_ 24. I have had several\r\n     conversations with Sir C. Wood, and from the language he now holds,\r\n     I consider it settled that the report of the commissioners will be\r\n     acted upon--the W.O. Commission being enlarged for the purpose of\r\n     dealing with Indian questions. I have also arranged with him for\r\n     the settlement of all personal claims arising out of our\r\n     enquiry.[27] I hope, therefore, that we may look on our work as\r\n     done for the present. It is probable that difficulties will arise\r\n     out of the conflicting claims of the Indian and home authorities:\r\n     but these we must be prepared for, and deal with as they come\r\n     up. So far, all has gone well.\r\n\r\n  [27] Mr. Herbert had promised, but apparently only by word of mouth,\r\n       that the services rendered by Dr. Farr and Dr. Sutherland to the\r\n       Commission should be paid. Miss Nightingale was able to confirm the\r\n       promise.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle wrote to her to like effect (Aug. 31): \"The Report\r\non the Indian Army is attracting much attention, and I have no doubt it\r\nwill do a great deal of good, tho' there is supposed to be still a very\r\nstrong obstructive power in the India Office.\" For a time, it seemed as\r\nif official measures would be taken with reasonable celerity. Two\r\nmembers, to represent India, were added to the Barrack and Hospital\r\nImprovement Commission. The Secretary for India sent a dispatch (Aug.\r\n15) suggesting the formation of Sanitary Commissions as recommended in\r\nthe Report. Miss Nightingale was asked to draft a code of suggestions\r\nwhich might be sent out to India. But soon there was a hitch. The\r\nmilitary element in the India Office quarrelled with the Report, and it\r\nwas intimated that there might be similar criticism from the military\r\nelement in the Government of India. The accuracy of Dr. Farr's\r\nstatistics was to be impugned; and it was to be objected that Miss\r\nNightingale's \"Observations\" did not in all cases reflect the present\r\nstate of the Indian stations. As if reports, which had taken and must\r\nhave taken months and months to collect, could possibly have been\r\nbrought up to the last moment! And as if the mere fact that such reports\r\nhad been called for was not likely to lead to some improvement! These\r\nthings need not detain us. They were, as Miss Nightingale put it, \"the\r\nCrimea over again,\" \"these and those\" protesting that things were not so\r\nbad as they had been painted, and that in any case it was not A who was\r\nto blame, but B. But meanwhile everything was hung up. Lord Stanley, the\r\nChairman of the Commission, whose Report was impugned, was in the\r\ncountry. Miss Nightingale \"urged and baited him\" (so she described it)\r\nto come up to London and return to the charge. He came in November, and\r\nhad an interview with her before seeing Sir Charles Wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nAnd now an event occurred which was followed by results of consequence\r\nto her cause. Lord Elgin, the Viceroy, while travelling in the\r\nHimalayas, was stricken down by a heart complaint from which he was not\r\nexpected to recover. The question of a successor became urgent. The\r\nminds of many turned to Sir John Lawrence, but, with one exception, no\r\nIndian civilian since Warren Hastings had permanently held the office of\r\nViceroy. Miss Nightingale had unbounded admiration for him. The\r\nsoldier's heart in her loved his heroic deeds. \"What would Homer have\r\nbeen,\" she once said, \"if he had had such heroes as the Lawrences to\r\nsing?\"[28] Personal intercourse had filled her with closer admiration\r\nfor what Lord Stanley called \"a certain heroic simplicity\" in the man,\r\nfor his unaffected piety, his rugged honesty, his deep sympathy with\r\nhuman suffering. In later years a photograph of Watts's portrait of\r\nLawrence always hung in Miss Nightingale's room. At the moment with\r\nwhich we are now concerned, she regarded him as the indispensable man\r\nfor India, not more on account of the threatening border war on the\r\nnorth-west frontier (the consideration which doubtless most moved Lord\r\nPalmerston), than on account of his sympathy with the cause of sanitary\r\nreform. An opportunity came for putting in her word. Sir Charles Wood\r\nconsulted his predecessor at the India Office, and Lord Stanley in turn\r\ntalked matters over with Miss Nightingale. She urged him with fervent\r\neagerness to do everything in his power to promote the appointment of\r\nSir John Lawrence. Lord Elgin died on November 20. Lawrence was\r\nappointed on November 30, and was to start for India immediately:--\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Stanley to Miss Nightingale._) _Dec._ 1. I saw Sir C. Wood\r\n     yesterday. The sanitary question was gone into, tho' not so fully\r\n     as I could have wished. Sir J. Lawrence's appointment is a great\r\n     step gained. He knows what is wanted, and has no prejudices in\r\n     favour of the existing military administration. I shall see him\r\n     to-night and shall probably be able to have some talk with him on\r\n     the subject. But why should not he see you? The plans are in the\r\n     main yours; no one can explain them better: you have been in\r\n     frequent correspondence with him. I believe there will now be but\r\n     little difficulty in India.... Let me repeat--you must manage to\r\n     see Sir John Lawrence. He does not go till the 10th. Your position\r\n     in respect of this whole subject is so peculiar that advice from\r\n     you will come with greater weight than from anyone else.\r\n\r\n  [28] Letter to Harriet Martineau (Feb. 2, 1865).\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was among the first to offer congratulations to the new\r\nViceroy; the terms in which she addressed him expressed what she\r\nsincerely and intensely believed:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Sir John Lawrence._) Among the multitude of\r\n     affairs and congratulations which will be pouring in upon you,\r\n     there is no more fervent joy, there are no stronger good wishes,\r\n     than those of one of the humblest of your servants. For there is no\r\n     greater position for usefulness under heaven than that of the\r\n     government of the vast Empire you saved for us. And you are the\r\n     only man to fill it. So thought a statesman with whom I worked not\r\n     daily, but hourly, for five years, Sidney Herbert--when the last\r\n     appointment was made. In the midst of your pressure pray think of\r\n     us, and of our sanitary things on which such millions of lives and\r\n     health depend.[29]\r\n\r\n  [29] From the _Life of Lord Lawrence_, by R. Bosworth Smith, 1885,\r\n       vol. ii. p. 278.\r\n\r\nPrompted by Lord Stanley, Miss Nightingale asked the new Viceroy to\r\ncall. He was the first of a succession of high Indian officials who made\r\na point of coming to Miss Nightingale before leaving for their posts.\r\nThe interview took place on December 4. Miss Nightingale never forgot\r\neither the interview itself or Lord Stanley's kindly anxiety that it\r\nshould take place. Thirty years later (Feb. 17, 1893), in sending\r\nAitchison's Memoir of Lord Lawrence to Sir Harry Verney, she wrote: \"How\r\nmany touches--short but sweet--I could add to the book! The real tale of\r\nSir J. Lawrence's appointment as Viceroy will never be told. During the\r\nonly ten days left to Lawrence before he started, he came to see me. How\r\nkind it was of Lord Stanley. He came like a footman to my door, and,\r\nwithout giving his name, sent up to ask whether Sir John Lawrence was\r\ncoming. The interview was one never to be forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nSir John Lawrence discussed the sanitary question with Miss Nightingale\r\nin all its bearings, and they exchanged views further by correspondence\r\nbefore he left London:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Dr. Farr._) _Dec._ 10. I have had the great joy\r\n     of being in constant communication with Sir John Lawrence, and of\r\n     receiving his commands to do what I had almost lost the hope of\r\n     being allowed to do--viz. of sending out full statements and\r\n     schemes of what we want the Presidency Commissions to do. I should\r\n     be glad to submit to you copies of papers of mine which he desired\r\n     me to write and which he took out with him, as to the constitution\r\n     of the Presidency Commissions, if you care to see them. They are,\r\n     of course, confidential. I have also seen Lord Stanley more than\r\n     once during these busy days. And with Sir John Lawrence's command,\r\n     we feel ourselves empowered to begin the Home Commission,[30] and\r\n     to further our plans upon it. Sir John Lawrence, so far from\r\n     considering our Report exaggerated, considers it under the mark.\r\n\r\n  [30] That is the Barrack and Hospital Improvement Commission (Army\r\n       Sanitary Committee), reinforced by India Office representatives,\r\n       which was to issue Sanitary Suggestions for the Government of India.\r\n\r\nThus was preparation made for putting the Report into execution in\r\nIndia. During Lawrence's Viceroyalty, Sir Bartle Frere was governor of\r\nBombay. \"Men used to say,\" he told Miss Nightingale, \"that they always\r\nknew when the Viceroy had received a letter from Florence Nightingale:\r\nit was like the ringing of a bell to call for sanitary progress.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nWithin a month of his arrival in India, Sir John Lawrence had set the\r\nSanitary Commissions on foot, and nothing was wanting except hints and\r\ninstructions from home:--\r\n\r\n     (_Sir John Lawrence to Miss Nightingale._) CALCUTTA, _Feb._ 5\r\n     [1864]. I write a line to say that we have commenced work by\r\n     establishing our Sanitary Committees for Calcutta, Madras, and\r\n     Bombay. They are composed of five members. A Civilian is at their\r\n     head, and a Medical Officer as Secretary. I hope that you will\r\n     expedite the transmission to India of the codes and rules and plans\r\n     which have been approved of for home and the colonies. We shall\r\n     then have an idea in a practical shape of the main features of the\r\n     sanitary system, and can readily adapt it to the peculiar\r\n     circumstances of the country. Without such a guide we shall often\r\n     be perhaps working in direct opposition to your views. Where we\r\n     differ, it will become our duty to set forth the grounds for so\r\n     doing, in sending our plans and reports home. Pray excuse this\r\n     hurried scrawl, and believe me, Sincerely yours, JOHN LAWRENCE.\r\n\r\nIt was not Miss Nightingale's fault that this plea for expedition was\r\nnecessary. In December 1863 Lord de Grey had again asked her to draft a\r\nletter to the India Office, as from the War Office, on the measures\r\nrecommended by the Royal Commission, and she had done it. But days,\r\nweeks, months passed, and nothing happened. In January 1864 her\r\n\"Suggestions in regard to Sanitary Works required for the Improvement of\r\nIndian Stations,\"[31] written at the urgent request of the\r\nGovernor-General, were ready, Dr. Sutherland, Dr. Farr, and\r\nMr. Rawlinson collaborating with her. Again months passed and nothing\r\nhappened. The Barrack and Hospital Improvement Committee had been\r\nofficially informed in December of the appointment of the Indian\r\nmembers, and requested to report on any matters which might be referred\r\nto it by the Secretary for India or the Secretary for War; but as yet no\r\nIndian reference had been made. Miss Nightingale chafed sorely at the\r\nneedless delay. The Governor-General wrote to her again and again\r\npressing for the Suggestions. She had done her part long ago; the War\r\nOffice had been in possession of her Draft for months. She tried plain\r\npressure, and pressure barbed with sarcasm. \"Poor man!\" she wrote in\r\nforwarding to the War Office one of the Governor-General's letters\r\n(March 10); \"he really expects despatch. He thinks we can write a letter\r\nin three months! He must be more fit for a Lunatic Asylum than for a\r\nGovernor-Generalship.\" Or, when the Government had been having a close\r\ndivision in the House,[32] she tried to play the India Office against\r\nthe War Office. \"You will all be 'out' this session,\" she wrote to the\r\nWar Office (March 7, 1864); \"after which I shall be able to get what I\r\nlike from Lord Stanley [I.O.], but _you_ will not be able to get what\r\nyou like from Gen. Peel [W.O.]. It is therefore very desirable that this\r\nletter should be written now at once while you are still 'in.'\" It\r\nturned out that the reason of the delay was this: the War Office _had_\r\nsent a preliminary letter to the India Office, and the India Office\r\nresented it. Sir Charles Wood, it was explained to Miss Nightingale, had\r\n\"snubbed\" Lord de Grey. The War Office was sulking in its tents\r\naccordingly. The India Office, on its part, was standing on its dignity,\r\nand was not going to place itself in the humiliating position of taking\r\naction proposed to it by the War Office. And this was the reason why\r\nMiss Nightingale's Suggestions, for which the Governor-General was\r\nasking, were still pigeon-holed. As for minor recommendations in the\r\nRoyal Commission's Report, it was quite true that many of them could be\r\ncarried out by administrative order, and some of them were; but the\r\ndifficulty in the case of others was that it had hitherto passed the wit\r\nof man to discover with whom the power, or the responsibility, of making\r\nthe order lay. Well may Miss Nightingale have written, as she did in\r\nmore than one letter of this time (Jan. 1864): \"No impression in all my\r\nlife was ever 'borne in upon me' more strongly than this, that the\r\nMinisters have never considered the respective jurisdictions of the W.O.\r\nand the I.O., and that I.O., W.O., Horse Guards at home,\r\nCommander-in-Chief in India, Governor-General in India are as little\r\ndefined as to the respective powers and duties as if India were the\r\nSandwich Islands.\"\r\n\r\n  [31] Bibliography A, No. 24.\r\n\r\n  [32] On March 1, on a debate on the Yeomanry, the majority had been 1.\r\n\r\nOn the major matter, the dispatch of sanitary suggestions to guide the\r\nIndian authorities, Miss Nightingale now resolved that the delay should\r\ncome to an end. She had drafted an ultimatum to the War Office,\r\nthreatening an attack in the House of Commons, when Lord Stanley, a\r\nprominent member of the Opposition, appeared on the scene. He had\r\nforewarned Miss Nightingale, as we have heard, that departmental\r\njealousies would cause some delay; but seven months had now passed since\r\nthe Report of his Commission had been issued, and he seems to have\r\nthought that this was time enough to allow for the two offices to let\r\noff steam between themselves. He wrote to Miss Nightingale suggesting\r\nthat he should come to see her, and offering, if she approved, to put\r\npressure either upon Lord de Grey or upon Sir Charles Wood. Miss\r\nNightingale loyally gave her friends at the War Office a last chance,\r\nbut they did not care to take it. Lord Stanley saw Sir Charles Wood\r\naccordingly, promised him parliamentary support in any action which he\r\nmight take, and matters were at last arranged. Miss Nightingale's draft\r\n\"Suggestions\" were submitted to the Barrack and Hospital Improvement\r\nCommission, and with slight alterations were adopted by that body. It\r\nwas a War Office Commission, but the dignity of the India Office was\r\nconsulted by the statement on the title-page of the Blue-book, that the\r\nSuggestions had been prepared by the said Commission \"in accordance with\r\nLetters from the Secretary of State for India in Council.\" The fact was\r\nthat they were prepared by Miss Nightingale in accordance with the\r\nwishes of Sir John Lawrence.\r\n\r\nWhen once the \"Suggestions\" had been passed officially, it was within\r\nher power, by the simple expedient of laying in a stock of early copies,\r\nto prevent a moment's further delay. She used the power; and could not\r\ndeny herself a few genial taunts at her official friends. \"I beg to\r\ninform you,\" she wrote to Captain Galton at the War Office (Aug. 8),\r\n\"that by the first mail after signature I sent off by H.M.'s book-post,\r\nat an enormous expense (I have a good mind to charge it to you!), to Sir\r\nJohn Lawrence direct no end of copies of _Suggestions_ (also to the\r\nPresidency Commissions); and that, as he is always more ready to hear\r\nthan you are to pray (you sinners!), I have not the least doubt that\r\nthey will have been _put in execution_ long before the India Office has\r\neven begun to send them.\"[33] She was not far wrong; six or seven weeks\r\nelapsed before the official copies were sent,[34] and meanwhile Miss\r\nNightingale was able to get in another gibe. She heard from Sir John\r\nLawrence that he had ordered the _Suggestions_ to be reprinted in India.\r\n\"It might be as well,\" she wrote to the War Office, \"to hurry your\r\ncopies for the India Office, who will otherwise receive them first from\r\nIndia.\"\r\n\r\n  [33] This was no idle taunt. The Government of India had already put in\r\n       force some of the recommendations of the Royal Commission before it\r\n       had officially received copies of the Report: see above, p. 34 and\r\n       _n._\r\n\r\n  [34] Miss Nightingale conducted a secret inquiry, which would have done\r\n       credit to a detective-inspector, into the causes of this delay.\r\n       According to \"information received,\" the first cause was that the\r\n       final printing order was delayed while communications went to and\r\n       fro between the War Office and the India Office upon the number of\r\n       copies required. Then the supply ultimately ordered by the latter\r\n       passed leisurely from one sub-department to another. Finally, the\r\n       stock reposed a while at a warehouse across the water, until there\r\n       were sufficient official papers to fill certain regulation cases of\r\n       a regulation size.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nIn India itself, advance, with Sir John Lawrence at the helm, was rapid.\r\nThe President and the Secretary of each Sanitary Commission were\r\nrequired to devote their whole attention to the work. They were charged\r\nto \"consider and afford advice and assistance in all matters relative to\r\nthe health of the Army, and to supervise the gradual introduction of\r\nsanitary improvements in Barracks, Hospitals, and Stations, as well as\r\nin Towns in proximity to Military Stations.\" Of every step taken, Miss\r\nNightingale was kept informed. Sir John wrote to her frequently to\r\nreport progress; he described to her the condition of all the Stations\r\nhe had inspected on his way up to Simla; he applied to her for\r\ninformation on special points. His private secretary, Dr. Hathaway, who\r\nalso had seen Miss Nightingale before he left England, wrote yet more\r\nfully and frequently. The President of the Bengal Commission was\r\nMr. Strachey.[35] He, too, had made Miss Nightingale's acquaintance, and\r\nthey corresponded at great length. Dr. J. P. Walker, a surgeon in the\r\nIndian Army, was in England in December 1863. He wrote to Miss\r\nNightingale, as a devoted follower of her school. He went out to India,\r\nwas appointed Secretary of the Bengal Commission, and at every stage\r\nconsulted her and reported to her. Mr. R. J. Ellis, President of the\r\nMadras Commission, and Dr. Leith, President of the Bombay one, also\r\ncorresponded with her. To any official in India, from the\r\nGovernor-General downwards, who was ready to listen, Miss Nightingale\r\nhad much to say. The correspondence with Sir John Lawrence is the most\r\ninteresting:--\r\n\r\n     (_Sir John Lawrence to Miss Nightingale._) SIMLEH, _June_ 12\r\n     [1864]. It was truly kind of you to write and give me so nice an\r\n     account of my children.... What an exciting time must Garibaldi's\r\n     visit to England have been. He is indeed a noble fellow, and fully\r\n     worthy of all our sympathies. I only trust that he will be\r\n     persuaded to keep quiet and bide his time. A good day for his\r\n     country, if the people only deserve it, must surely come. I am\r\n     doing what I can to put things in order out here; but it is a very\r\n     uphill work, and many influences have to be managed and overcome. I\r\n     often think of the last visit I paid you before leaving England and\r\n     of your conversation on that occasion. You will recollect how much\r\n     I dwelt on the difficulties which meet one on every side. These\r\n     have been exemplified in a way I could scarcely understand or\r\n     anticipate, by the good folks of England really believing that I\r\n     had sanctioned an attack on the religion of the Hindoos, because I\r\n     desired to improve the health of the people in Calcutta!\r\n\r\n  [35] John Strachey (1823-1907); afterwards Chief Commissioner of\r\n       Oudh, Lieut.-Governor of the N.W. Provinces, financial member of\r\n       the Governor-General's Council; knighted, 1872; G.C.S.I., 1878; and\r\n       member of the Secretary of State's Council.\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Sir John Lawrence._) 32 SOUTH STREET, _Sept._\r\n     26 [1864]. MY DEAR SIR JOHN LAWRENCE--I always feel it a kind of\r\n     presumption in me to write to you--and a kind of wonder at your\r\n     permitting it. I always feel that you are the greatest figure in\r\n     history, and yours the greatest work in history, in modern times.\r\n     But that is my very reason. We have but one Sir John Lawrence. Your\r\n     Bengal Sanitary Commission is doing its work, like men--like\r\n     martyrs, in fact,--and what a work it is! All we have in Europe is\r\n     mere child's play to it. Health is the product of civilization,\r\n     _i.e._ of real civilization. In Europe we have a kind of\r\n     civilization to proceed upon. In India your work represents, not\r\n     only diminished Mortality as with us, but increase of energy,\r\n     increase of power of the populations. I always feel, as if God had\r\n     said: mankind is to create mankind. In this sense you are the\r\n     greatest creator of mankind in modern history....\r\n\r\n     Would there be any impropriety in your Sanitary Commissions sending\r\n     copies of their printed Minutes to the Barrack and Hospital\r\n     Improvement Commission here, through the India Office--merely for\r\n     information? As far as your Bengal Commission goes: these men don't\r\n     want urging: they have not now to be taught. Anything which might\r\n     even appear to interfere with the responsibilities of your\r\n     Commissions, unless at their own request, is not only undesirable:\r\n     but, as far as the Bengal Comm^n. is concerned, useless. But, if\r\n     you saw no objection to sending the Minutes for information to the\r\n     War Office Commission here, I am sure they would very much like it.\r\n     Or, if that would be too formal and official (as regards the India\r\n     Office here), if they, the Minutes, might be sent to me, with\r\n     permission to shew them to one or two, such as Lord Stanley (our\r\n     late Chairman of the Royal Commission), Dr. Sutherland, and Capt.\r\n     Galton, of the War Office, &c., it would answer the same purpose.\r\n     The India Office here does not shew _now_ the least jealousy of the\r\n     Barrack and Hosp^l. (War Office) Commission. On the contrary, one\r\n     can scarcely help smiling at the small things it is glad to throw\r\n     off its responsibility for upon said Commission.\r\n\r\n     There are three glaring (tho' lesser) evils in Calcutta about which\r\n     I know you have been employed--lesser tho' they are--and your\r\n     attention and Dr. Hathaway's have been aroused by them. These are:\r\n     (1) The Police Hospitals (or state of Hosp^l. accommodation) for\r\n     sick poor at Calcutta. The Police establishments seem about as bad\r\n     as possible. Indeed the poor wretches are brought in mostly to die.\r\n     The Parisian system of relief is very good: every Police station at\r\n     Paris has means of temporary help in cases of emergency until the\r\n     sufferers can be removed to Hospital. Some such arrangement with a\r\n     thorough reform of the Hospitals, and such additional accommodation\r\n     as may be wanted, might meet Calcutta's case.\r\n\r\n     (2) The condition of Jails and Lunatic Asylums in India. Certainly\r\n     it is not for me to draw your attention or Dr. Hathaway's to this.\r\n     Probably he knows more about them than any man living. The reports\r\n     and recommendations of one or two of the Jail Inspectors shew that\r\n     they want experience: as I am sure Dr. Hathaway will agree with me.\r\n     Perhaps we might help you by sending out such Reports on the\r\n     subject as may be useful.\r\n\r\n     (3) The seamen at the great Ports. You have already done so much.\r\n     But Rome can't be built in a day. Bad water, bad food bought in\r\n     Bazaars, and bad drinks cause a vast amount of disease and death.\r\n     Self-supporting Institutions, such as our Sailors' Homes (of which,\r\n     indeed, I believe you have already founded more than one), would\r\n     give the men wholesome food and drink, and lodgings and day-rooms\r\n     at little cost. So many men perish for want of this kind of\r\n     accommodation at Calcutta, where the evil seems greatest.\r\n\r\n     It seems to me so base to be writing while you are doing. Oh that I\r\n     could come out to Calcutta and organize at least the Hospital\r\n     accommodation for the poor wretches in the streets. There is\r\n     nothing I should like so much. But it is nonsense to wish for what\r\n     is an impossibility. I am sure you will be glad to hear that one of\r\n     my life-long wishes, viz. the nursing of Workhouse Infirmaries by\r\n     proper Nurses, is about to be fulfilled. By the munificence of a\r\n     Liverpool man (who actually gives £1200 a year for the object, but\r\n     desires not to be named), we undertake next month the Liverpool\r\n     Workhouse Infirmary (of 1000 beds)--the first Workhouse that ever\r\n     has been nursed--with 15 Head Nurses, trained by ourselves, and a\r\n     Lady (Volunteer) Matron (who underwent a most serious course of\r\n     training at our Nurses' School at St. Thomas' Hospital), 15\r\n     Assistants, and 52 ex-pauper women, whom we are to train as\r\n     Nurses.[36] I am sure it is not for us to talk of Civilization. For\r\n     I have seen, in our English Workhouse Infirmaries, neglect,\r\n     cruelty, and malversation such as can scarcely be surpassed in\r\n     semi-barbarous countries. And it was then I felt I must found a\r\n     school for Nurses for Workhouses, &c. The opportunity has come too\r\n     late for me to do the Workhouse Nursing myself. But, so it is well\r\n     done, we care not how. I think with the greatest satisfaction upon\r\n     your re-union with Lady Lawrence and (some of) your children. God\r\n     bless you.--I am yours devotedly, FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\n     _P.S._--The Calcutta Municipality does not seem yet to have wakened\r\n     up to a sense of its existence. It does not know that it exists:\r\n     much less, what it exists for. Still, you are conquering India anew\r\n     by civilization, taking possession of the Empire for the first time\r\n     by knowledge instead of by the sword.--F. N.\r\n\r\n  [36] On this subject, see below, p. 128.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief in India, Sir Hugh Rose (Lord Strathnairn) was\r\nhardly less helpful in the cause than the Governor-General. The War\r\nOffice had sent to him, through the Horse Guards, a letter inviting his\r\nattention to the regimental recommendations in the Royal Commission's\r\nReport. His reply was most sympathetic, and his period of command was\r\nmarked, amongst other things, by two reforms specially near to Miss\r\nNightingale's desires: he introduced regimental workshops and soldiers'\r\ngardens in cantonments. The War Office forwarded his letter to Miss\r\nNightingale. \"It is quite worth while,\" she wrote in reply (Aug. 11,\r\n1864), \"all that has been suffered,--to have this letter from Sir Hugh\r\nRose. And I forgive everybody everything.\" \"I sing for joy every day,\"\r\nshe had written previously (June 6), \"at Sir John Lawrence's\r\nGovernment.\" She made public thanksgiving. To the Social Science\r\nCongress at Edinburgh in October 1863, she had contributed a paper,\r\nentitled, \"How People may Live and not Die in India,\" in which she gave,\r\nin concise and popular form, a _résumé_ of the Royal Commission's\r\nReport. The reading of her paper had been followed by \"Three Cheers for\r\nFlorence Nightingale.\" She now (Aug. 1864) republished the Paper, with a\r\nPreface, in which, as it were, she gave \"Three Cheers for Sir John\r\nLawrence.\" She described how the Commissions of Health had been\r\nappointed in India, and how they had now been put in possession of all\r\nthe more recent results of sanitary works and measures which had been of\r\nuse at home. Then she turned to the military authorities, and described\r\nhow \"several of the worst personal causes of ill-health to which the\r\nsoldier was in former times exposed have been, or are being, removed.\"\r\n\"The men,\" she wrote, \"have begun to find out that it is better to work\r\nthan to sleep and drink, even during the heat of the day. One regiment\r\nmarching into a Station, where cholera had been raging for two years,\r\nwere chaffed by the regiments marching out, and told they would never\r\ncome out of it alive. The men of the entering battalion answered, they\r\nwould see; we _won't_ have cholera, they think. And they made gardens\r\nwith such good effect that they had the pleasure, not only of eating\r\ntheir own vegetables, but of being paid for them too by the\r\nCommissariat. And this in a soil which no regiment had been able to\r\ncultivate before. And not a man had cholera. These good soldiers fought\r\nagainst disease, too, by workshops and gymnasia.\"[37] She gave account\r\nof trades, savings' banks, games, libraries; noting what had been done\r\nand what yet remained to be done. \"In the meantime the regulation two\r\ndrams have been reduced to one. A Legislative Act imposes a heavy fine\r\nor imprisonment on the illicit sale of spirits near cantonments. Where\r\nthere _are_ recreation rooms, refreshments (prices all marked) are\r\nspread on a nice clean table.\" All these things, which in 1864 were new\r\nor exceptional, became in later years well-established and the rule. The\r\nmain causes of disease among the Army in India were, however, as Miss\r\nNightingale went on to say, want of drainage, want of proper\r\nwater-supply, want of proper barracks and hospitals. But in these\r\nrespects she had set the reformers to a work which has continued from\r\nthat day to this.\r\n\r\n  [37] This incident was told in Sir Hugh Rose's letter.\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, some criticism at the start, but this touched only\r\nthe past, and did not seriously affect the future. Indian officials felt\r\naggrieved, as I have already said, at the strictures contained in the\r\nReport of the Royal Commission, and this movement came to a head in two\r\ndocuments--one, a counter-Report by Dr. Leith, the Chairman of the\r\nBombay Sanitary Commission (Oct. 1864); the other, a dispatch (Dec. 8)\r\nfrom the Government of India (Sir John Lawrence on an important point\r\ndissenting). Lord Stanley thought that Dr. Leith ought to be answered at\r\nonce, and wrote to Miss Nightingale (Oct. 25) for her advice on the\r\nsubject. She suggested that the answer should be sent in the form of a\r\nReport on Dr. Leith's letter by the Barrack and Hospital Improvement\r\nCommission--an ingenious plan, as it gave opportunity to that expert\r\nbody for giving further advice to one of the Presidency Commissions.\r\nMiss Nightingale and Dr. Sutherland drafted the Report, which was\r\nadopted by the Commission on January 6, 1865. \"I have pleasure,\" wrote\r\nLord Stanley to her (Dec. 26), \"in sending back the draft reply to Dr.\r\nLeith with only one or two verbal amendments suggested. It seems to me\r\nwell done, moderate in tone, and conclusive in argument.\" A reply to the\r\nIndian Government's Dispatch, signed by Lord Stanley, Dr. Farr, and Dr.\r\nSutherland, was sent on May 20. Miss Nightingale in her eagerness was\r\nmuch annoyed by these criticisms,[38] and Lord Stanley often told her\r\nthat she made too much of what were only temporary ebullitions. \"Don't\r\nbe discouraged, dear Miss Nightingale,\" he wrote (Jan. 22) when the\r\nGovernment of India's dispatch arrived; \"the practical work may go on\r\nwhile the controversy is proceeding. My idea of the matter is that the\r\nIndian authorities only want time to set things a little in order--that\r\nthey are willing to mend, but not inclined to give us the credit of\r\nhaving first put them in the right way. That is human nature.\" Lord\r\nStanley was a true prophet. The Indian authorities did mend; and so\r\nsuccessfully has the work been carried out by a long line of Commanders,\r\nAdministrators, and Engineers that the death-rate from preventable\r\ndisease among the British Army in India has fallen far below the figure\r\nwhich the Royal Commission named as a counsel of perfection.[39]\r\n\r\n  [38] If any reader should desire to follow up the criticisms and the\r\n       replies, he will find the Reply to Dr. Leith in Parliamentary\r\n       Papers, 1865, No. 329; and the Government of India's dispatch\r\n       with the Reply, in Nos. 108 and 324. Dr. Leith's Report does not\r\n       appear to have been reprinted as a Parliamentary Paper. A copy of\r\n       it, printed at Bombay, 1864, is among Miss Nightingale's papers.\r\n\r\n  [39] The Commission looked forward to a rate of not more than 10 per\r\n       1000. The rate in 1911 was, as already stated, 5.04.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nIn this work of \"salvation\" Miss Nightingale was for many years to play\r\na part as consultant, and sometimes as inspirer. In November 1864 the\r\nGovernor-General in Council intimated his readiness to consider a scheme\r\nfor the employment of nurses in Military Hospitals, and thereupon the\r\nBengal Sanitary Commission requested Miss Nightingale to aid them by her\r\nadvice. She wrote in collaboration with Sir John McNeill a comprehensive\r\nseries of Suggestions in the following February.[40] Throughout the year\r\n(1865) Miss Nightingale was engaged from time to time in Indian sanitary\r\nbusiness; and her house served as headquarters for the sanitary\r\nreformers. Mr. Ellis, the President of the Madras Commission, came home\r\nin the middle of the year in order to study sanitary reforms in this\r\ncountry. Miss Nightingale invited him to use her rooms; sent Dr.\r\nSutherland to accompany him on visits of inspection to hospitals and\r\nbarracks; arranged meetings between him and Lord Stanley; conferred with\r\nhim on changes which Sir John Lawrence was proposing to make in the\r\nconstitution of the Presidency Commissions. The Governor-General himself\r\ncommunicated with her freely on the same subject. The Secretary of the\r\nBengal Commission applied to her for information on trustworthy tests\r\nfor the discovery of organic matter in water. Being unable to obtain\r\nwhat was wanted from Dr. Parkes, she applied to Dr. Angus Smith\r\n(inventor of an air-test also), who wrote a pamphlet for her on the\r\nsubject. It was printed at her expense. She had it approved by the War\r\nOffice Sanitary Committee, and a large number of copies was distributed\r\nthroughout India. She had impressed upon the Governor-General the\r\nimportance of stirring up the Indian municipalities. The Indian Towns\r\nMunicipal Improvement Bill (1865) was submitted for her criticism, and\r\nshe wrote a \"Note on the relations which should exist between the powers\r\nof raising and spending taxes proposed to be granted to local\r\nauthorities, and the proper execution of sanitary works and measures in\r\nIndia.\" Her friend, Sir Charles Trevelyan, retired from the post of\r\nFinancial Minister in India in 1865, and she made the acquaintance of\r\nhis successor, Mr. W. N. Massey. She was very jubilant when she \"got a\r\nvote of seven millions for my Indian barracks.\" She was depressed when\r\nthe Governor-General wrote to her from time to time saying that the\r\ngreat obstacle in the way of speedier reform was want of money; but she\r\nmade excuses for her hero. \"Sir John Lawrence,\" she wrote to Madame Mohl\r\n(March 20, 1865), \"is just as much hampered with the Horse Guards out\r\nthere as I am here. He is always writing to me to apologize for the\r\nlittle progress he makes. By the very last mail he says I shall think\r\nhim 'timid and perhaps even time-serving.' I could not help laughing.\r\nCertainly Sir J. Lawrence is the only man who ever called Sir J.\r\nLawrence a time-server,--except in the highest possible sense, of\r\nserving his country at her greatest time of need in the highest possible\r\nway.\" She was constantly corresponding with Lord Stanley, urging him to\r\nwin points for her from the Indian Secretary. \"I have just seen Sir\r\nCharles Wood,\" wrote Lord Stanley (Feb. 10). \"He agrees as to the\r\nexpediency of sending home a yearly report of the sanitary stations in\r\neach Presidency.\" \"Pray never speak of being troublesome,\" he wrote\r\nagain (May 15): \"it is a real pleasure to me to help you a little in the\r\ngreat work: I know no other way in which my time can be made equally\r\nuseful.\" He frequently saw Sir Charles Wood on matters which she urged,\r\nand he won what was almost her highest praise. \"Lord Stanley,\" she said,\r\n\"is a splendid worker.\" His cool common sense was perhaps a wholesome\r\nantidote sometimes to her almost feverish eagerness. \"Publicity,\" he\r\nsaid (Aug. 17), \"will in the long-run do what we want. People won't\r\nstand being poisoned when they know it.\" The annual Reports from the\r\nPresidencies, obtained by Miss Nightingale some years later (p. 155),\r\nwere submitted for her \"Observations\"; and in many other ways, as we\r\nshall hear, it was remarkable how close a touch upon the course of\r\nsanitary reform in India was maintained by this lady from a bedroom in\r\nMayfair. But essentially Miss Nightingale's work was that of inspirer\r\nand pioneer. These chapters will have shown, I think, that a compliment\r\npaid to her by the Chairman of the Indian Sanitary Commission was no\r\nless true than graceful:--\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Stanley to Miss Nightingale._) ST. JAMES'S SQUARE, _July_ 25\r\n     [1864]. I don't wonder that the delays of the \"savage tribe\" should\r\n     try your patience; and I admire the more the care and success with\r\n     which you keep outward show of annoyance to yourself. I had rather\r\n     be criticised by any one rather than you! I am only passing through\r\n     town to-day, there being nothing left to do; but shall be again in\r\n     this place on Thursday, and ready to wait upon you if any matters\r\n     want settling. If not, I can only wish you health--success is sure\r\n     to come--and beg that you will remember the value of your own\r\n     public service, and not by overwork endanger its continuance. Pray\r\n     excuse a caution which I am sure I am not the first to give. Every\r\n     day convinces me more of two things: first, the vast influence on\r\n     the public mind of the Sanitary Commissions of the last few\r\n     years--I mean in the way of speeding ideas which otherwise would\r\n     have been confined to a few persons; and next, that all this has\r\n     been due to you, and to you almost alone.\r\n\r\n  [40] Bibliography A, No. 44. For the subsequent fate of this scheme, see\r\n       below, p. 157.\r\n\r\nIn one of many moments of vexation at the delays of the \"savages\" in\r\ntheir red-tape, Miss Nightingale wrote thus to Captain Galton (June 23,\r\n1864): \"The Horse Guards say that they were quite aware of Sir John\r\nLawrence's application and of the delay, but that 'it is Sir J.\r\nLawrence's one and only object of interest, while it is _one out of a\r\nthousand_ of the War Office's.' They ought to have the V.C. for their\r\ncool intrepidity in the face of truth. I have told Sir J. Lawrence of\r\nthe opinion of these dining-out _freliquets_ as to his hard work. And I\r\nthink I shall publish it after my death.\" But \"unlicked cubs,\" as she\r\nsaid at Scutari, \"grow up into good old bears\"[41]; and it is not in\r\norder to pay off a score against the \"puppies\" that I quote this letter.\r\nBehind the remark which excited Miss Nightingale's righteous anger there\r\nwas an element of unconscious truth, and it is one which sums up this\r\nand the preceding chapter. It was, indeed, an ignorant untruth to say\r\nthat Sir John Lawrence had no other work or interest than the promotion\r\nof sanitary improvements for the Army in India; and it would be untrue\r\nalso, as later chapters will show, to say the same thing of Miss\r\nNightingale. Yet it made all the difference for the promotion of that\r\nwork in India that there was at the head of affairs a man whose heart\r\nand soul were in it. And at home, it made all the difference that there\r\nwas one resolute will, combined with a clear head, determined to give\r\nimpetus and direction to the work. It was probably quite true to say\r\nthat to many, perhaps to most, of the men at the War Office and the\r\nHorse Guards this question of Army sanitation in India appeared as only\r\n\"one out of a thousand\" questions. To Miss Nightingale it was, in a very\r\nliteral and instant sense, a matter of life and death; and it was her\r\npassionate conviction that supplied the initiating and driving force\r\nwhich compelled reform. If the Governor-General of the time had been\r\nhostile or apathetic, even her persistence might yet have been foiled.\r\nBut, as things were, the co-operation between Sir John Lawrence and\r\nFlorence Nightingale was as beneficent in its results upon the welfare\r\nof the British Army in India, as the co-operation between her and Sidney\r\nHerbert had been in the case of the Army at home.\r\n\r\n  [41] See Vol. I. p. 184.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                    ADVISORY COUNCIL TO THE WAR OFFICE\r\n\r\n                                (1862-1866)\r\n\r\n\r\n     We are trying to reduce chaos into shape. It is three years to-day\r\n     since I first felt what an awful wreck I had got myself into. I\r\n     interfering with Government affairs; and the captain of my ship,\r\n     without whom I should never have done it, dying and leaving me, a\r\n     woman, in charge. What nonsense people do talk, to be sure, about\r\n     people finding themselves in suitable positions and looking out for\r\n     congenial work! I am sure if any body in all the world is most\r\n     unsuited for writing and official work, it is I. And yet I have\r\n     done nothing else for seven years but write Regulations.--FLORENCE\r\n     NIGHTINGALE (_Letter to Julius Mohl_, Jan 1. 1864).\r\n\r\nThough Miss Nightingale's main work during these years was connected\r\nwith the Army in India, she was also continuously engaged in work for\r\nthe War Office in relation to the army at home. Indeed in some respects\r\nthe work was as constant, and it was quite as varied, if not as\r\nfar-reaching in range, as in the days when Sidney Herbert was Secretary\r\nof State. She was a kind of Advisory Council to the War Office on all\r\nsubjects within her sphere, and on some outside it; but the references\r\nto her were far more frequent than is commonly the case with those\r\nsomewhat shadowy bodies; and besides she was a privileged person, with\r\nthe right of initiating suggestions. The picture of her relations to the\r\nWar Office as it is disclosed in her papers is remarkable. There are\r\nscores of letters from the Ministers. There are hundreds from one of the\r\n(non-political) Under-Secretaries. Her own letters in reply are equally\r\nnumerous. There is a large collection of Drafts, Minutes, Warrants,\r\nRegulations. Her private letters tell of frequent interviews with one of\r\nthe Ministers. Was there ever another case in which nearly every vexed\r\nquestion in War Office administration (other than of a purely military\r\nkind) was referred almost as a matter of course to a private lady, and\r\nthat lady an invalid in her bed? It is not likely that the situation\r\nwill ever exist again; and it becomes of interest to trace \"the\r\nNightingale power\" in this matter to its sources.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe primary explanation is simple. In a large class of questions which\r\nwere occupying the attention of the War Office at this time Miss\r\nNightingale was regarded as the first expert of the day. One sees this\r\nin the fact that she was consulted in connection with work, within her\r\nsphere, for other departments than the War Office. Thus in 1865 Mr. R.\r\nS. Wright (afterwards the judge) was appointed by the Colonial Office to\r\nprepare a Report on the condition of Colonial Prisons. He went to Miss\r\nNightingale, asking (April 27) \"to be allowed to submit to you for your\r\ncriticism the conclusions at which I may arrive. Supposing them to be\r\napproved by you, it will be a great advantage if I may state that you\r\napprove them.\"[42] Then, in the second place,--to repeat a phrase which\r\nI have already applied to her, she was the official legatee of Sidney\r\nHerbert. Everyone who was behind the scenes knew that his work had also\r\nbeen her work, and Sidney Herbert's repute as a reformer stood very\r\nhigh. The official Army world at this time was divided into two\r\ncamps--those who desired to complete Herbert's work, and those who tried\r\nto undo it. Miss Nightingale, as the repository of the Herbert\r\ntradition, was the indispensable ally of the former party against the\r\nlatter. Her friend, Lady Herbert, put the case from her point of view,\r\nwhen she wrote (March 7, 1862), in reply to a letter telling of much\r\nweakness and weariness, \"If you never wish to live for your own sake,\r\nyet bear to live, dearest, for a time to carry out his work, and to keep\r\nhis memory fresh in the hearts of men.\" Some questions of reform arose\r\nto which Sir Benjamin Hawes had raised copious objections. \"Would Miss\r\nNightingale oblige the Political Under-Secretary by suggesting an answer\r\nto Hawes's points?\" Sometimes she was the only person who possessed the\r\nnecessary documents. \"Have you got a copy of the Report of the Committee\r\non the Organization of a Medical School? The War Office actually have\r\n_no_ copy, and the Army Medical Department only a proof not signed and\r\nsupposed to have been altered?\"\r\n\r\n  [42] Miss Nightingale must have enjoyed the correspondence that ensued;\r\n       for not only was Mr. Wright sound on sanitary matters (\"it is no\r\n       part of a prisoner's sentence that he should be black-holed\"), but\r\n       he wrote to her in a racy style. \"I send you (Oct. 23) a specimen\r\n       of the materials sent home by colonial prison authorities with the\r\n       endorsement of a colonial Governor:--_Question_: What is the mode\r\n       of treating lunatic or maniacal prisoners? _Answer_: Maniacles is\r\n       not nor ever has been in use in this prison.\"\r\n\r\nBut besides all this there were personal factors in the case. Miss\r\nNightingale had no longer, it is true, an intimate friend at the head of\r\nthe War Office, and with Lord Herbert's successor, Sir George Lewis, she\r\nwas not otherwise than by correspondence acquainted. Early in 1862 he\r\nhad made overtures through Sir Harry Verney, desiring to be given the\r\nhonour of making Miss Nightingale's personal acquaintance. She was,\r\nhowever, too ill to receive him, and knowing perhaps her proficiency in\r\nthe classics he sent her some of his _jeux d'esprit_. The offering had\r\nanything but a propitiatory effect. Many of her letters express\r\nindignation that the Secretary for War should be writing trifles in\r\nLatin instead of reforming the War Office. She was equally indignant\r\nwhen he presently published learned works on Ancient Astronomy and\r\nEgyptology. Mr. Jowett was somewhat of the same mind: \"I agree with you\r\nabout Sir G. Lewis and his book. I felt the same disgust at Gladstone\r\nfor writing nonsense about Homer while the East India Bill was passing\r\nthrough the House.\" It does not seem to follow, however, that\r\nMr. Gladstone would have been the more interested in the East India Bill\r\nif he had not been engaged in finding the Trinity on Mount Olympus, or\r\nthat Sir George Lewis would have been any more in the mood to reorganize\r\nthe War Office if he had not been applying the Egyptological method to\r\nmodern history, or turning \"Hey diddle diddle\" into Latin verse. There\r\nis a keener point in another of Miss Nightingale's reflections on the\r\nMinister (Feb. 19, 1863): \"If Sir George Lewis, instead of writing a\r\n'Dialogue on the Best Forms of Government' would write (or rather\r\nsilently act) a _Monologue_ on the Dual Form being the Worst form of\r\nGovernment, the War Office would be much the gainer.\" But during his\r\nterm of office the Under-Secretary was Lord de Grey; and with him she\r\nwas on very friendly terms, and he, as is obvious from the\r\ncorrespondence, had the highest opinion of her knowledge, her ability,\r\nand her influence. The part she played in Lord de Grey's appointment as\r\nSecretary of State, after the death of Sir G. Lewis, has already been\r\ndescribed. Then in Captain Galton she had throughout these years a\r\nstanding ally within the War Office, and her daily attendant, Dr.\r\nSutherland, was a member of the Army Sanitary Committee. And in the last\r\nresort, if a difficulty worthy of such adjustment arose, she had the ear\r\nof the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nSuch occasion did arise when, on May 15, 1862, death removed from the\r\nWar Office Miss Nightingale's old opponent Sir Benjamin Hawes, the\r\nPermanent Under-Secretary. She had tried to reorganize him into\r\ninsignificance in 1861, but \"Ben had beaten Sidney Herbert.\"[43] Now was\r\na chance of carrying out the plan which Mr. Herbert and she had often\r\ndiscussed--of breaking the bureaucracy, and of dividing up the office.\r\nHitherto the Departments had reported through the Permanent\r\nUnder-Secretary; the reform scheme was that they should report direct to\r\nthe Secretary of State. Sir E. Lugard, Military Under-Secretary, was\r\nalready in part-possession. Let Captain Galton resign his commission,\r\nand take the other half, as a civilian (and, what was equally in her\r\nmind, a convinced and professional sanitarian). She carried the case to\r\nthe Prime Minister, and convinced him. Lord Palmerston told her\r\nafterwards that when the appointment was first mentioned to the Horse\r\nGuards they said it was \"simply impossible.\" But the Prime Minister\r\nadvised Sir George Lewis to make the appointment nevertheless:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to her Father._) 9 CHESTERFIELD STREET, _Poor\r\n     Queen's Birthday_, 1862. I must tell you the first joy I have had\r\n     since poor Sidney Herbert's death. Lord Palmerston has forced Sir\r\n     G. Lewis to carry out Mr. Herbert's and my plan for the\r\n     reorganization of the War Office _in some measure_. Hawes's place\r\n     is not to be filled up. Galton is to do his work as Assistant\r\n     Under-Secretary. This brings with it some other reforms. Lord de\r\n     Grey says that he can reorganize the War Office with Captain\r\n     Galton, because Sir G. Lewis will know nothing about it and never\r\n     inquires. Sir G. Lewis wrote it (innocently) to the Queen\r\n     yesterday, and Captain Galton was appointed to-day, resigning the\r\n     Army of course. No, Sir Charles Trevelyan would not have done at\r\n     all [in Hawes's place]. It would have been perpetuating the\r\n     principle (which I have been fighting against in all my official\r\n     life, _i.e._, for eight years) of having a dictator, an autocrat,\r\n     irresponsible to Parliament, quite unassailable from any quarter,\r\n     immovable in the middle of a (so-called) constitutional government,\r\n     and under a Secretary of State who is responsible to Parliament.\r\n     And, inasmuch as Trevelyan is a better and abler man than Hawes, it\r\n     would have been _worse_ for any reform of principle. I don't mean\r\n     to say that I am the first person who has laid down this. But I do\r\n     believe I am the first person who has felt it so bitterly, keenly,\r\n     constantly as to give up life, health, joy, congenial occupation\r\n     for a thankless work like this.... It has come too late to give\r\n     happiness to Galton, as it has come too late for me. He seems more\r\n     depressed than pleased. And I do believe, if he feels any pleasure,\r\n     it is that now he can carry out Sidney Herbert's plans in some\r\n     measure. And it may seem to you some compensation for the enormous\r\n     expense I cause you that, if I had not been here, it would not have\r\n     been done. Would that Sidney Herbert could have lived to do it\r\n     himself! Would that poor Clough could have lived to see it! He\r\n     wished for it so much--for my sake....\r\n\r\n  [43] See Vol. I. p. 405.\r\n\r\nThe high hopes which Miss Nightingale entertained from this slight\r\nreorganization were doomed to disappointment. Neither as\r\nUnder-Secretary, nor after April 1863, when he became Secretary of\r\nState, did Lord de Grey manage, and I do not know that he seriously\r\nattempted, to reform the War Office root and branch.[44] He and Captain\r\nGalton had, according to Miss Nightingale, \"miscalculated their power.\"\r\nShe preached the necessity of reform to them unceasingly--in season and,\r\nas they may sometimes have thought, out of season too, for she was a\r\nvery persistent person; and, with Dr. Sutherland's assistance, she\r\nprovided them with detailed schemes. Her principles were as admirable,\r\nas was her criticism scathing when any breach of them came under her\r\nnotice. There must in all things, she said, be a clear definition of\r\nresponsibility, with a logical differentiation of functions; and the\r\nbusiness of the War Office was to prepare for war--not to jog along with\r\nan organization which might hold together in peace, but would break down\r\nin the field. Some papers were submitted to her criticism (June 1862).\r\n\"What strikes me in them,\" she wrote, \"is the black ignorance, the total\r\nwant of imagination, as to a state of _war_ in which the _War_ Office\r\nseems to be. Really if it was a Joint Stock Company for the manufacture\r\nof skins, it could not, as far as appears, be less accustomed to\r\ncontemplate or to imagine or to remember a state of war.\" I am afraid\r\nthat most of us have lived through times when the same criticism could\r\nhave been made. Let us hope that it is all a matter of ancient history\r\nnow. Papers were sent to her dealing with the questions of Purveying and\r\nCommissariat. The Commissariat had hitherto been the bankers of the\r\narmy, and some of the permanent officials saw no reason for a change.\r\nFrom her experience in the Crimea she gave them the reason. The\r\nconfusion of functions worked badly in the field.[45] As it was bound to\r\ndo, for it was absurd. \"Is a man who buys bullocks the best man to be a\r\nbanker? Would it not be better to have a separate Treasurer for the Army\r\nto receive all moneys and issue them to all departments? In private life\r\nnobody makes his steward or butler his banker. It would not be\r\neconomical. Finance is as much a specialty as marketing, and as much so,\r\nto say the least of it, in the Army as in private life.\"\r\n\r\n  [44] There is a succinct account of organizations and reorganizations\r\n       between 1854 and 1868 in a _Memorandum on the Organization of the\r\n       War Office_ by Captain Galton, dated November 1868.\r\n\r\n  [45] See Vol. I. p. 231.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nComplete reform of the War Office was, then, to remain a task for the\r\nfuture; but Miss Nightingale thought that Lord de Grey and Captain\r\nGalton did the administrative work well. Much of it was done with her\r\nassistance. From Miss Nightingale's point of view, the most important\r\nthing done under the Lewis-De Grey régime was the placing on a permanent\r\nfooting of the Barrack and Hospital Improvement Commission. It was\r\nimportant, first, as keeping sound sanitary principles to the forefront\r\nin the execution of new works at home. It also, as already explained,\r\nprovided machinery for promoting sanitary improvements in India. The\r\npoint, next to its permanence, on which she most insisted was that the\r\nCommission should not be under the Army Medical Department, but should\r\nbe directly responsible to the Secretary of State. \"Lord de Grey said,\"\r\nwrote Captain Galton (June 25, 1862), \"that he had adopted exactly your\r\nMinute about the Instructions to the Commission.\" With its Secretary,\r\nMr. J. J. Frederick, Miss Nightingale was on very friendly terms, and\r\nDr. Sutherland was its most active member. Most of the plans for new\r\nbarracks or hospitals were submitted to her, and her inspection and\r\ncriticism of them were searching. Then in 1862 the Government was about\r\nto build a new Military General Hospital at Malta. With Dr. Sutherland's\r\naid, she went into every detail, and her Report on the plans occupies\r\ntwenty-four pages of manuscript. In 1865 Sir Hope Grant succeeded Sir\r\nRichard Airey as Quarter-master General, and in that capacity as\r\nchairman of the Barrack Commission, the name of which was now changed to\r\nthe Army Sanitary Committee. He went to see Miss Nightingale, \"proud to\r\nthink that she remembered him\"; and the conversation must have been\r\nsatisfactory; for \"our new President is a Trump,\" reported Dr.\r\nSutherland to her.\r\n\r\nIn examining plans, she always had a thought for the horses. When the\r\nplans for some cavalry barracks were sent for her criticism she put in a\r\nplea (June 4, 1863) for windows in the loose-boxes out of which the\r\nhorses could see. \"I do not speak from hearsay,\" she wrote to Captain\r\nGalton, \"but from actual personal acquaintance with horses of an\r\nintimate kind. And I assure you they tell me it is of the utmost\r\nimportance to their health and spirits when in the loose-box to have a\r\nwindow to look out at. A small bull's-eye will do. I have told Dr.\r\nSutherland but he has no feeling.\" To which Dr. Sutherland added: \"We\r\nhave provided such a window and every horse can see out if he chooses to\r\nstand on his hind legs with his fore-feet against the wall. It is the\r\nleast exertion he can put himself to, and if your doctrine is right, he\r\nwill no doubt do it.\" Miss Nightingale had learnt to love the army\r\nhorse in the Crimea. Many years later, some very bad barracks were\r\nclosed in Ireland, and men and horses were moved to the Curragh. It was\r\nthe horses, she wrote, who had done it. \"If we are not moved, they said,\r\nwe shall mutiny. _Military_ horses are quite capable of organizing\r\nmovements. Did you ever hear of Jack? Jack was a riderless horse (his\r\nmaster having been killed) at the Charge of Balaclava. And he was seen\r\ncollecting about 30 riderless horses, and at the head of his troop\r\nleading them back to, I suppose, Cavalry Headquarters. I have failed to\r\ndiscover whether Jack allowed horseless men to mount some of his horses.\r\nThese men certainly returned on horseback--but when they found that a\r\ncomrade, or an officer, was missing, they rode back, one and another,\r\nmounted the wounded man, and fought their way out of the Russian melée,\r\nbut many died in the attempt--a glorious death. And when I see in the\r\nhansom-cabs horses who by their beautiful legs must have been hunters or\r\neven racers, galloping up Park Lane as long as they can stand, I say too\r\n'a glorious death'; and horses should teach _us_, not we them, duty--do\r\nyou think.\"[46]\r\n\r\n  [46] Letter of April 12, 1896, to Mrs. Henry Bonham Carter.\r\n\r\nAll regulations for military hospitals and for their nursing staff were\r\nsimilarly submitted to Miss Nightingale. She had a poor opinion of the\r\ncapacity of the male mind to frame rules for female nurses. \"By the\r\nunited skill,\" she wrote (Feb. 16, 1863), of \"Mess^{rs.} ---- and ----,\r\nthe following Regulations for Female Hospitals were put together:--(1)\r\nKennel your nurses and chain them up till wanted; (2) When the number of\r\nPatients does not exceed----, chain up the Nurses without food; (3) Let\r\nthe number of Nurses vary every day as the number of Patients varies. I\r\nsend you an _amended_ copy which, if you approve, might be put into\r\ntype.\" She was constantly appealed to in connection with disputes caused\r\nat Netley by the difficult temper of Mrs. Shaw Stewart, the\r\nSuperintendent of the Female Nursing Staff. She and Miss Nightingale\r\nwere no longer close friends, but Miss Nightingale's sense of justice\r\nwas strong, and she continuously supported Mrs. Stewart's authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nAnother large batch of the semi-official correspondence is concerned\r\nwith Miss Nightingale's favourite child, the Army Medical School, and\r\nwith the position of the Army doctors generally. The troubles of the\r\nprofessors were still many; the relation of the School to the Secretary\r\nof State on the one hand, and to the Army Medical Department on the\r\nother, was much vexed; and, when the School was moved to Netley (1863),\r\na fresh set of difficulties cropped up. Miss Nightingale was constantly\r\nappealed to, sometimes by the staff, sometimes by the War Office, to\r\nsmooth over difficulties, to suggest ways out, to settle disputed\r\nquestions. She was recognized by the War Office as a kind of\r\nsuper-professor. One of the staff sought official sanction for a book on\r\nthe work of the School: \"Lord de Grey wants to know whether he is\r\ncapable; also whether his proposed syllabus is good. Also to have any\r\ncritical suggestions upon it which Miss Nightingale could kindly\r\ncommunicate.\" Her verdict was favourable. I have been told that some\r\nArmy doctors of to-day, knowing little about Miss Nightingale except\r\nthat she found fault with medical arrangements in the Crimea, suppose\r\nher not to have been their friend. Nothing could be further from the\r\ntruth. What she blamed was not the doctors (for most of whom she had the\r\ngreatest admiration), but the system. From first to last, she was the\r\nmost efficient friend that the Army Medical Service ever had. In 1862-63\r\nthere is a long series of letters from her to the War Office, in which\r\nshe persistently pleaded for improvement in their status and emoluments.\r\nIt was in connection with this matter that she wrote to Captain Galton\r\n(Dec. 24, 1863): \"_In re_ Medical Warrant, I am meek and humble, but 'I\r\ncut up rough.' I am the animal of whom Buffon spoke, _Cet animal féroce\r\nmord tous ceux qui veulent le tuer_. You must do something for these\r\ndoctors; or they will do for you, simply by not coming to you.\" A series\r\nof letters to Sir James Clark in the following year shows with what\r\npertinacity she fought the battle of the Army doctors, and how\r\nindignant she was at any slights cast upon them:--\r\n\r\n     _April_ 6 [1864]. I have written threatening letters both to Lord\r\n     de Grey and to Captain Galton about the [Medical Officers']\r\n     Warrant; and after pointing out that both restoration of Warrant\r\n     and increase of pay are now necessary, I have shown how, when we\r\n     are exacting duties from the Medical Officer, such as sanitary\r\n     recommendations to his Commanding Officer, which essentially\r\n     require him to have the standing of a gentleman with his Commanding\r\n     Officer,--we are doing things, such as dismounting him at parade,\r\n     depriving him of presidency at Boards, etc., which in military\r\n     life, to a degree we have no idea of in civil life, deprive him of\r\n     the weight of a gentleman among gentlemen.\r\n\r\n     _April_ 7. The W.O. seem now willing to listen to some kind of\r\n     terms. They are frightened. They sent me your letter. It was very\r\n     good, very firm. Don't be conciliatory.\r\n\r\n     _April_ 9. I wrote _for the tenth time_ a statement of eight pages,\r\n     with permission to make any use of it they pleased, with my\r\n     signature, as to Lord Herbert's intentions. But I positively\r\n     refused to write to Mr. Gladstone, who certainly ought not to grant\r\n     me what the Secretary of State of War does not urge.\r\n\r\n     _April_ 11. What is wanted is to put a muzzle on the Duke of\r\n     Cambridge, and to tell him that he _must not_ alter a Royal\r\n     Warrant.\r\n\r\n     _April_ 15. You may think I am not wise in being so angry. But I\r\n     assure you, when I write civilly, I have a civil answer--_and\r\n     nothing is done_. When I write furiously, I have a rude\r\n     letter--_and something is done_ (not even then always, _but only\r\n     then_).\r\n\r\nIn the following year there was a debate in the House of Lords upon the\r\nMilitary Hospitals which greatly interested, and personally affected,\r\nMiss Nightingale. Early in March Lord Dalhousie (the Lord Panmure of\r\nearlier days)[47] gave notice of a motion to call attention to the\r\nexpenditure on the Netley Hospital and the Herbert Hospital\r\nrespectively, and it was rumoured that the ex-Minister intended to\r\ndeliver a set attack upon two of his successors, the late Lord Herbert\r\nand Lord de Grey. The War Office, in order to be fully prepared, sent to\r\nMiss Nightingale for a brief. She gladly supplied it, and she entered\r\ninto the fray with great spirit. She was very angry that the memory of\r\nher \"dear master\" should be assailed, but I think that she enjoyed not a\r\nlittle the prospect of yet another encounter with \"the Bison.\" She had\r\nbeaten him before, and was determined that he should be beaten now. She\r\nadvised Lord de Grey to avoid giving an advantage to the enemy by\r\nwithholding any credit to which he was justly entitled. She recalled\r\nthat at the last time they met, Lord Panmure had complained to her that\r\nshe ascribed every sanitary reform in the Army to Sidney Herbert, though\r\nsome of the reforms had been started by himself. She admitted, and\r\nadvised Lord de Grey to admit, that Lord Panmure had deserved well of\r\nthe Army by the measures which he took in the Crimea, and by initiating\r\nsome steps for reducing the mortality at home. These things being\r\nadmitted, the defence of Lord Herbert would carry the more weight.\r\nHaving armed the Secretary of State with materials to meet any attack\r\nthat might be made, Miss Nightingale turned to organize a second line of\r\ndefence. Sir Harry Verney was dispatched to ask Mr. Gladstone's advice.\r\nMr. Gladstone thought that Lord Harrowby should be retained for the\r\ndefence, and he was approached. Miss Nightingale sent watching briefs\r\nalso to her own friends, Lord Shaftesbury and Lord Houghton.[48] When\r\nLord Dalhousie's motion was taken, the rumours turned out to be well\r\nfounded. He extolled his Netley (the non-\"pavilion\" hospital) as\r\nperfect, and criticized the Herbert Hospital (\"pavilion\") as a costly\r\ntoy in the \"glass-and-glare\" style, and in a long speech attacked the\r\n\"wasteful\" system which Lord Herbert had introduced by paying attention\r\nto \"hygienists who had carried their opinions too far.\" He had, I\r\nsuppose, \"that turbulent fellow,\" Miss Nightingale, in his mind when \"he\r\ncould not help thinking that all these unnecessary knick-knacks in\r\nhospitals were introduced partly from the habit, which prevailed at the\r\nWar Office, of consulting hygienists not connected with the army.\" The\r\npersonal animus in the attack was thought so obvious that the speech\r\nfell very flat. And Lord de Grey's reply--\"quite admirable\" according to\r\nMiss Nightingale--was so courteous, yet so conclusive, that her\r\n\"counsel\" were unanimously of opinion that not another word was\r\nnecessary. Apart from any personal question, Lord Dalhousie's speech[49]\r\nhas a certain historical interest as embodying some of the prejudices\r\nagainst which Miss Nightingale as a Hospital Reformer had to contend. A\r\nlittle later in the year a military attack on the sanitarians was\r\nthreatened in the House of Commons, but this only took the form of\r\nquestions about the vote under which payment by the War Office to Dr.\r\nSutherland appeared.[50] Miss Nightingale sent a note to the War Office,\r\nsetting forth the facts and emphasizing the value of his services in the\r\ncause of sanitary improvement.\r\n\r\n  [47] He had succeeded to the earldom of Dalhousie on the death of his\r\n       cousin, the 10th earl and first marquis, in Dec. 1860.\r\n\r\n  [48] Mr. R. Monckton Milnes had been created Baron Houghton in 1863.\r\n\r\n  [49] It is in _Hansard_ on March 6, 1865.\r\n\r\n  [50] _Hansard_, June 19 and 30, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nThese were subjects in which Miss Nightingale was directly concerned,\r\nbut questions of many other kinds were referred to her. I find in the\r\ncorrespondence with the War Office during these years that, in addition\r\nto matters otherwise mentioned in this chapter, her advice was asked\r\nupon such subjects as an Apothecaries' Warrant, barracks for Ceylon,\r\n\"Fever Tinctures,\" Instructions for Cholera, fittings for Military\r\nHospitals, the proposed amalgamation of the Home and Indian Medical\r\nServices, the organization of Hospitals for Soldiers' Wives, Sanitary\r\nInstructions for New Zealand, revision of soldiers' rations, staff\r\nappointments at Netley, appointment of West Indian staff surgeons, an\r\noutbreak of Yellow Fever in Bermuda, the relation of Commissariat\r\nBarracks and Purveying at Foreign Stations, victualling on transports\r\nand the Mhow court-martial.[51] On one occasion she was asked to send\r\nhints for a speech in the House of Commons. Lord Hartington, then\r\nUnder-Secretary for War, would have to defend a large increase in the\r\nvotes for Hospital and Medical Service. The Crimean War and Miss\r\nNightingale's crusade had raised the expenditure from £97,000 in 1853-54\r\nto £295,000 in 1864-65. \"Could you send me a paragraph for Lord\r\nHartington's speech,\" she was asked, \"to show the salient points of what\r\nthe nation gets for its money? Something pithy, put in your best\r\nmanner.\" \"There is nothing in the world I should like so much,\" she\r\nreplied (Feb. 29, 1864), \"as to have to do Lord Hartington's speech and\r\nstand in his shoes on such an occasion.\" She sent some pithy\r\ncomparisons; and, in case the Minister wanted something heavier, a\r\ndetailed memorandum. I suppose Lord Hartington chose the heaviness and\r\nrejected the pith; for when Miss Nightingale read the parliamentary\r\nreport, she thought the speech a poor performance.[52] The same kind of\r\nreferences to Miss Nightingale went on when in 1866, on Lord de Grey's\r\ntransference to the India Office,[53] Lord Hartington became Secretary\r\nof State for War. \"Can you throw light,\" she was asked (June 21, 1866),\r\n\"on the position of the medical officers of the _Guards_? This is very\r\npressing. The whole matter is an awful mess, and Lord Hartington is\r\nanxious to leave it in some way of settlement.\" On the following day a\r\nlucid and exhaustive Memorandum on the subject went in from her.\r\n\r\n  [51] The history of this affair, which excited a prodigious interest in\r\n       Parliament and the press, may be read by the curious in vol. xxxiii.\r\n       of the Parliamentary Papers of 1863, and vol. xxxv. of those of\r\n       1864. Miss Nightingale's good offices were asked by the War Office\r\n       to parry an attack by \"Jacob Omnium,\" for whose part in the affair\r\n       see _Essays on Social Subjects_, by Matthew John Higgins, 1875,\r\n       pp. lvi.-lx.\r\n\r\n  [52] It certainly was dull: see _Hansard_, March 3, 1864.\r\n\r\n  [53] See below, p. 108.\r\n\r\nIn July 1864 Miss Nightingale was engaged on a piece of work for the War\r\nOffice which was closely associated with her Crimean experiences and\r\nwith her European repute. It was in August of that year that the\r\ninternational congress was held which framed the famous Geneva\r\nConvention. The British delegates were Miss Nightingale's friend, Dr.\r\nLongmore, and Dr. Rutherford, and she drafted their Instructions. The\r\nprinciple of the Convention was the neutralization of the wounded under\r\nthe Red Cross. Societies formed under the Red Cross were soon organized\r\nthroughout Europe, and the movement led to a great development of\r\nvolunteer-nursing in war time.\r\n\r\nSometimes Miss Nightingale sent in suggestions on her own account. She\r\nwas in close touch with soldiers and sailors, and a woman's sympathetic\r\ninsight appears in this letter:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Captain Galton._) _Sept._ 21 [1863]. People\r\n     are complaining that when a Regiment sails, many of their wives and\r\n     children are left behind, and the soldiers are unable to make any\r\n     provision for their support until they have reached their\r\n     destination, say China or Calcutta (after a four months' voyage\r\n     round the Cape), and have been able to send money through their\r\n     Captains to their families at home. Meanwhile the families have\r\n     gone through five or six months of distress. For sailors leaving a\r\n     port in England or Ireland, the Admiralty provides power to leave a\r\n     standing order that a certain amount of pay is to be sent regularly\r\n     to their families. The W.O. objects that a similar arrangement\r\n     would \"involve a change in their book-keeping.\" It would involve no\r\n     change. It would involve a small addition. I am willing to go the\r\n     length of 6d. to furnish an account-book to the W.O., which would\r\n     enable them to keep these additional accounts. The W.O. also\r\n     objects that it would deprive the Captain of the chance of fining\r\n     the soldiers for any military offence. But they can learn the\r\n     Admiralty system; and whilst there are other ways of \"doing\" the\r\n     soldiers, their pay is the only means of providing bread for their\r\n     families starving (or doing worse) at home. Surely the soldiers\r\n     might be allowed to leave, for the probable duration of their\r\n     voyage, and for a month or two beyond it, a sum to be paid weekly\r\n     to their representatives at home. Sir E. Lugard has been tried and\r\n     failed. Pray set this right. But the W.O. would not be the W.O., if\r\n     such things as these were not. And when they have ceased to be, the\r\n     War Office will have ceased to be.\r\n\r\nSatire was not the only weapon which Miss Nightingale employed in order\r\nto get things done. Sometimes she appealed to the motive of rivalry. Was\r\nthe Minister hanging back? Well, all she could say was that Sidney\r\nHerbert would have done the thing in a moment. There were difficulties\r\nin the way, were there? The subordinate officials were piling up what\r\nthey were pleased to call \"reasons\" to the contrary, were they? Well,\r\n\"on this day many years ago,\" she wrote (June 18, 1862), \"the French\r\nguns kept coming up again and again to get us out of the yard at\r\nHougomont, and we answered in strong language, often repeated, till we\r\nkept the ground that we had won. I never heard the French guns called\r\nreasons. And I advise you to answer in the same way, because there is\r\nno other way of answering. Lord de Grey's Minute is the gun which just\r\nhas to be fired over again.\" And sometimes she resorted, as of old, to a\r\nlittle bullying. \"I send you,\" she wrote (March 26, 1863), \"my protest\r\nabout the Medical School. Make what use of it you like. But, if we fail,\r\nI shall refer it to Lord Palmerston who, as you know, befriended us on a\r\nformer occasion (after Hawes's death)\"--a home thrust, this, as it was\r\nby a personal reference to Lord Palmerston that she had secured Captain\r\nGalton's appointment.\r\n\r\nThere was one occasion when, for a wonder, the pressure to be prompt and\r\ndecided came not from her, but from the War Office. The Governorship of\r\nthe Woolwich Hospital fell vacant; she had been sent a list of names\r\nwith a request to advise upon them, and she had not immediately replied.\r\n\"I wrote,\" she explained (Feb. 11, 1863), \"to various authorities the\r\nvery moment your and Lord de Grey's letters were put into my hands. The\r\nanswers cannot be long delayed. But what would you think of my opinion\r\nif I volunteered it about men whom I know only by name? Had you asked me\r\nabout Lord William Paulet or Colonel Storks or Sir Richard Airey, I\r\ncould have given you an opinion off-hand with the utmost want of\r\nmodesty. The very moment I have any reliable information you shall have\r\nit. But it takes some time to make such an inquiry, or what would it be\r\nworth? And Woolwich, I suppose, is not on fire, or with the enemy at the\r\ngates?\" But for some reason or other, the War Office was in a hurry, and\r\nthe appointment was made before her inquiries were completed. Her\r\nconscientiousness thus lost her the chance of deciding a piece of\r\npatronage. Not, indeed, that she felt any loss in such a case. She was\r\nnothing of a jobber. She pulled wires, as I have told, in some special\r\nappointments where she believed that a high public cause was at stake;\r\nbut she was never actuated by personal favouritism, or by the love of\r\npersonal influence on behalf of individuals. For this very post, she had\r\nreceived fifty letters of application, she said, but she had taken no\r\naction upon them. Only once, she said on another occasion, had she\r\nsolicited anything as a personal favour from the War Office. It was an\r\nappointment for a Presbyterian Chaplain, who was not personally known\r\nto her, but whose hard and deserving case (as she thought it) had been\r\nbrought to her notice. She was once sent a list of the Army Medical\r\nService, and asked by a Minister to mark the names, for his private and\r\nconfidential use, with her approbation or otherwise. This she\r\nrespectfully declined to do. When she was asked a specific question\r\nabout an officer whom she had known in the Crimea or elsewhere, she gave\r\nan opinion freely, and generally managed to put it pointedly; as of a\r\ncertain Commandant: \"As you often see in those round-headed, red-faced\r\nmen, he has a great deal of conscience and very little judgment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nA subject, in which Miss Nightingale took great and painful interest\r\nduring these years, was the State regulation of vice. The legislation of\r\n1864, 1866, and 1869 was already being promoted and considered in 1862.\r\nThe subject was odious to Miss Nightingale, but her experiences in\r\nforeign hospitals and at Scutari had made her peculiarly familiar with\r\nit. Her private correspondence with doctors and military officers shows\r\nthat for some years before 1862 she had given much thought and study to\r\nthe question, and had carefully tested conclusions drawn from her\r\npersonal observations by statistics and by the opinions of other\r\npersons. She hated the system of regulation on moral grounds, but she\r\nwas equally convinced that the case for it had not been satisfactorily\r\nestablished by statistical evidence on hygienic grounds. On this point,\r\ntwo of the medical men, upon whose judgment she placed most\r\nreliance--Dr. Sutherland and Dr. Graham Balfour (the head of the Army\r\nStatistical Department)--agreed with her. With their assistance she\r\nworked up the case against the continental system, and at the request of\r\nSir George Lewis, who was considering the matter in 1862, she wrote a\r\nprivate paper, which was circulated among some members of the Government\r\nand others. \"Your facts,\" wrote Captain Galton to her (April 29, 1862),\r\n\"have shaken Lord de Grey's views on the subject of police inspection.\"\r\nWith Mr. Gladstone, she was less successful. He found her Paper \"of\r\ndeep interest and full of important fact and argument,\" and said that,\r\nas a result of reading it and her letters, he should approach the\r\nsubject \"with much of circumspection as well as of anxiety\"; but he\r\n\"doubted the possibility of making a standing army a moral institution.\"\r\nTherein she profoundly differed, and she urged, in rejoinder, that\r\nnothing should be done on his assumption, at least until the other had\r\nbeen given a fair trial--by increasing the soldiers' facilities for\r\nmarriage, by giving them better opportunities for instruction and\r\nrecreation, by encouraging physical exercise and manual handicrafts.\r\nOfficial opinion steadily hardened, however, in the direction of\r\nregulation; and presently public opinion was tested by a series of\r\narticles in the _Times_ in favour of the continental system. Miss\r\nNightingale thereupon supplied Harriet Martineau with facts and figures,\r\nand the _Times_ was answered by the _Daily News_. Miss Nightingale also\r\nprinted her own Paper for a more extended, though still \"private and\r\nconfidential,\" circulation. Dr. Sutherland chivalrously assumed the sole\r\nauthorship, and was acrimoniously attacked by some of his professional\r\nbrethren. The Army Medical Department was working hard for regulation,\r\nand some person therein, suspecting Miss Nightingale as the real leader\r\nof the opposition, disgraced himself by sending her an anonymous letter\r\nof vulgar abuse. This of course did not deter her, and, when legislation\r\nwas proposed, she lobbied indefatigably (through correspondence) against\r\nit. The opinion of the House of Commons was, however, overwhelmingly in\r\nits favour. When the legislation was passed, the War Office invited her\r\nassistance in the selection of medical officers under the Act; but she\r\nrefused to touch what she regarded as an accursed thing. It was left to\r\nanother of the remarkable women of the nineteenth century, to secure,\r\nafter a struggle of sixteen years, the repeal of the Acts; but though\r\nMiss Nightingale shrank from taking a public part in that crusade, she\r\ngave support privately to Mrs. Josephine Butler. At a later time,\r\nhowever, Miss Nightingale somewhat modified her views.[54]\r\n\r\n  [54] Below, p. 408.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's failure during the years 1862-64 to arrest the\r\nmovement of public opinion in the direction which she detested,\r\nincreased her eagerness to promote what she considered the more\r\nexcellent way. She was the life and soul at headquarters of the movement\r\nfor increasing the supply of Reading-rooms, Soldiers' Clubs,\r\nRecreation-rooms, and facilities for useful employment. \"I will tell\r\nyou,\" she wrote to the Reverend Mother of the Bermondsey Convent (Jan.\r\n3, 1864), \"how I spent my Christmas Day and the Sunday after, those\r\nbeing two holidays: in preparing a scheme, by desire of Lord de Grey,\r\nfor employing soldiers in trades.\" She wrote a Memorandum on \"Methods of\r\nStarting an Exhibition (Soldiers' Trades),\" and such an exhibition was\r\nheld at Aldershot in the summer of 1864.[55] Whenever there was a\r\ndifficulty to be overcome, or an opportunity to be seized, Miss\r\nNightingale was appealed to. For instance, there was a fight for a\r\ncertain disused Iron House at Aldershot. Miss Nightingale's party\r\n(supported at the War Office) wanted it for a Men's Recreation Room; the\r\nHorse Guards wanted it for an Officers' Club. A promise had already been\r\ngiven in favour of the former, but Sir George Lewis was wavering. \"Lord\r\nde Grey thinks,\" wrote Captain Galton (April 29, 1862), \"that the best\r\ncourse for the Iron House is for Sir H. Verney to ask Sir G. L. in the\r\nHouse about it, alluding to his former promise, and if it could be\r\narranged that Monckton Milnes, Gen. Lindsay, or any other persons could\r\ncheer or support the proposals, it would pledge Sir G. L. to act at\r\nonce.\" Miss Nightingale set her parliamentary friends to work, and the\r\nfight for the Iron House was won. Lord de Grey succeeded in getting a\r\nvote on the Estimates for the encouragement of such places. Miss\r\nNightingale revised for him a set of Regulations for Reading-Rooms. She\r\nalso, at his request, drew up (in concert with Captain Pilkington\r\nJackson) an inventory of the appropriate furniture and other fitments.\r\nHer zeal in this matter was known abroad; at Montreal and Halifax and\r\nGibraltar commanding-officers who were trying to start or develop\r\ninstructions of the kind applied to her. She often succeeded in\r\nobtaining War Office grants for them, and these she supplemented by\r\ngifts of her own. No inconsiderable portion of her resources at this\r\ntime went in subscriptions of this sort, either in money or in kind\r\n(carpentering equipment, bagatelle boards, books, prints, and the like).\r\nIt is pleasant to read the letters in which the non-commissioned\r\nofficers and men of regiments, which had been served by Miss Nightingale\r\nin the Crimea, sent thanks, through their commanding officers, to \"that\r\nnoble lady for her continued interest in the welfare of the British\r\nsoldiers.\"\r\n\r\n  [55] Attention was called to it, and the moral was pointed, by a leading\r\n       article in the _Daily News_ (July 8), doubtless written by Harriet\r\n       Martineau.\r\n\r\nIt was a cause of great pleasure to Miss Nightingale that in 1864 her\r\nold friend of the Scutari days, General Storks, who had encouraged her\r\nthere in work of this kind,[56] was appointed to the command at Malta.\r\n\"I am very grateful to you,\" he wrote (Nov. 10), \"for seeing me the\r\nother day, and can only express the great gratification I experienced on\r\nthat occasion. I can never forget the time when I was associated with\r\nyou in the great work which has produced such satisfactory results, and\r\nfor which the whole army will ever thank you. When one reflects on the\r\ncondition of the soldier ten years ago and what it is now, there is\r\ncause for wonder at the difficulties you have overcome, and the results\r\nyou have achieved.... (Nov. 18.) All the arrangements contemplated at\r\nMalta, both legislative (if necessary) and administrative, shall be\r\nsubmitted for your consideration and approval in draft before they are\r\nacted upon, and I need not say how grateful I shall be for your kind\r\nassistance.\" In later years Miss Nightingale took a friendly interest in\r\nthe Soldiers' Institute at Portsmouth, founded by Miss Sarah Robinson. A\r\nmeeting was held in its support at the Mansion House in 1877, at which\r\nLord Wolseley presided, and a letter from Miss Nightingale was read. \"If\r\nyou knew,\" she said, \"as I do (or once did), the difference between our\r\nsoldiers cared for in body, mind, and morals, and our soldiers uncared\r\nfor--the last, 'hell's carnival' (the words are not my own), the first,\r\nthe finest fellows of God's making; if you knew how troops immediately\r\non landing are beset with invitations to bad of all kinds, you would\r\nhasten to supply them with invitations to, and means for, good of all\r\nkinds: remembering that the soldier is of all men the man whose life is\r\nmade for him by the necessities of his Service. We may not hope to make\r\n'saints' of all, but we can make men of them instead of brutes. If you\r\nknew these things as I do, you would forgive me for asking you, if my\r\npoor name may still be that of the soldiers' ever faithful servant, to\r\nsupport Miss Robinson's work in making men of them at Portsmouth, the\r\nplace of all others of temptation to be brutes.\"\r\n\r\n  [56] See Vol. I. p. 279.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VII\r\n\r\nEven the multifarious interest described in preceding pages and chapters\r\ndo not tell the whole tale of Miss Nightingale's labours during this\r\ntime. It was not only the British soldiers at home and in India whom she\r\ntook under her protection; nor only the War Office and the India Office\r\nwith which she had some connection. She was open to any human appeal for\r\nhelp, and her acquaintance with Sir George Grey led her, through a\r\nfriendly Minister at the Colonial Office, to make an attempt for the\r\nprotection of the aboriginal races in the British Dominions. She had met\r\nSir George Grey in 1859 and 1860, and he had talked to her about the\r\ngradual disappearance of those races when brought into touch with\r\ncivilization. This was a subject which appealed strongly to Miss\r\nNightingale. Her mission in life was to be a \"saviour\" of men. It shamed\r\nher to think that her country in colonizing so large a part of the world\r\nshould so often come into contact with inferior races only to destroy\r\nthem. In the course of conversation with Sir George Grey, the question\r\nwas raised whether the disappearance of the aboriginal races was in any\r\ndegree due to the effect of European school usages and school education.\r\nMiss Nightingale determined to investigate the matter. She drew up\r\nschedules of inquiry, and the Duke of Newcastle (then Colonial\r\nSecretary) officially circulated them to Colonial Schools and Colonial\r\nHospitals (1860). As each return came in during following years, it was\r\nforwarded from the Colonial Office to Miss Nightingale. Her inquiries\r\nwere far more searching and detailed, I notice on looking through the\r\npapers, than were the answers. There were not many passionate\r\nstatisticians in those days among the schoolmasters or doctors attached\r\nto native schools or hospitals in distant colonies, and the results of\r\nMiss Nightingale's researches in this obscure field were somewhat\r\ndisappointing. She summarized the information in a Paper which she\r\ncontributed to the Social Science Congress at Edinburgh in 1863, and\r\nwhich she printed as a pamphlet.[57] The Duke of Newcastle sent the\r\npamphlet to colonial governors and other officials, and invited their\r\nremarks. To the Congress in 1864 Miss Nightingale contributed a further\r\nPaper (also printed as a pamphlet[58]), embodying the substance of some\r\nof the later information thus obtained. The documents which she received\r\nfrom the Colonial Office during several years are preserved amongst her\r\npapers, and form what is, I suppose, a unique collection of information\r\non a curious subject. Though her researches did not lead to any positive\r\nconclusions in relation to the effect of education as such upon the\r\ndeterioration of the wild races, they disclosed much neglect of sanitary\r\nprecautions. She pointed out mistakes that were made in the kind of\r\nclothing into which in the name of decency the native children were put.\r\nShe applied in a wider way the principle that their open-air habits\r\nshould be remembered, insisting especially on the importance of physical\r\nand manual training. The returns from colonial hospitals showed again\r\nthat preventable causes--bad drainage, bad water, and so forth--were to\r\nblame for much of the mortality. \"Incivilization with its inherent\r\ndiseases, when brought into contact with civilization without adopting\r\nspecific precautions for preserving health, will always carry with it a\r\nlarge increase of mortality on account of the greater susceptibility of\r\nits subjects to those causes of disease which can, to a certain extent,\r\nbe endured without as great a risk by civilized communities born among\r\nthem.\" But principally Miss Nightingale based upon the results of her\r\ninquiries a moral appeal to the conscience of popular opinion and\r\ngovernments in the Colonies and in Downing Street. \"The decaying races\r\nare chiefly in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and perhaps in certain\r\nparts of South Africa. They appear to consist chiefly of tribes which\r\nhave never been civilized enough, or had force of character enough, to\r\nform fixed settlements or to build towns. Such tribes have few fixed\r\nhabits or none. But the papers show that they are naturally, in their\r\nuncivilized condition, possessed of far stronger stamina, and that they\r\nresist the effects of frightful wounds and injuries far better than\r\ncivilized men. This latter fact tells strongly against any natural\r\nproclivity to diseased action.\" The course of history does not show that\r\nsuch appeals as Miss Nightingale's have been wholly successful. It seems\r\nto be, as Mr. Froude said, that with men, as with orders of creation,\r\nonly those wild races will survive who can domesticate themselves into\r\nservants of the newer forms. Where there is such ability, where the\r\nlabour of the coloured races is required by the white men, the\r\naboriginal races survive, and even thrive and multiply; where those\r\nconditions do not exist, they do not survive. So far, however, as the\r\nextinction of native races has been arrested, Miss Nightingale was among\r\nthe pioneers in pointing out the way. Her clear intelligence, acting\r\nupon the mass of evidence which she had collected, perceived certain\r\nprinciples which have guided all practical statesmen who sought to\r\nprotect aborigines, and to free civilization from one of its disgraces.\r\nShe urged that \"provision of land should be made for the exclusive use\r\nof existing tribes.\" She pleaded passionately for the suppression of the\r\nliquor traffic.[59] She argued that in the formal education, and in all\r\nother means of endeavouring to improve the natives, \"there should be as\r\nlittle interference as possible with their born habits and conditions,\"\r\nthat interference should be wise and gradual, and that above all\r\n\"physical training and a large amount of out-door work are essentially\r\nnecessary to success.\" She did not succeed in arresting the decline of\r\nthe aboriginal races; but she contributed something to their protection.\r\n\r\n  [57] Bibliography A, Nos. 39 and 40.\r\n\r\n  [58] _Ibid._ No. 47.\r\n\r\n  [59] A letter to her on this subject (Dec. 6, 1864) from the permanent\r\n       Under-Secretary at the Colonial Office is printed in _Letters of\r\n       Frederick Lord Blachford_, 1896, p. 251.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VIII\r\n\r\nThus, then, in all the various ways described in this chapter did Miss\r\nNightingale labour, but especially in the cause of the British Army. The\r\nrôle of the Soldiers' Friend which she had filled in the Crimea was\r\nenacted on a conspicuous stage. Her work was now all done behind the\r\nscenes; and done, as I have already described, under heavy physical\r\ndisability. Much of the work was, moreover, dull and even uncongenial;\r\nbut she fed her soul on higher things:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Mrs. Moore._) 32 SOUTH STREET, _Dec._ 15\r\n     [1863]. DEAREST REVD. MOTHER--I am here, as you see--(My\r\n     brother-in-law's house--where you were so good as to see me last\r\n     year--to think of that being more than a year ago) and have been\r\n     here a good bit. But I have had all your dear letters. And you\r\n     cannot think how much they have encouraged me. They are almost the\r\n     only earthly encouragement I have. I have been so very ill--and\r\n     even the little change of moving here knocks me down for a month.\r\n     But God is so good as to let me still struggle on with my business.\r\n     But with so much difficulty that it was quite impossible to me to\r\n     write even to you. And I only write now, because I hear you are\r\n     ill. I have felt so horribly ungrateful for never having thanked\r\n     you for your books. S. Jean de la Croix's life I keep thankfully. I\r\n     am never tired of reading that part where he prays for the return\r\n     for all his services, _Domine, pati et contemni pro te_. I am\r\n     afraid I never could ask that. But in return for very little\r\n     service, I get it. It is quite impossible to describe how\r\n     harassing, how heart-breaking my work has been since the beginning\r\n     of July. I have always, with all my heart and soul, offered myself\r\n     to God for the greatest bitterness on my own part, if His (War\r\n     Office) work could be done. But lately nothing was done, and always\r\n     because there was not one man like Sidney Herbert to do it.... I\r\n     don't think S. Jean de la Croix need have prayed to be dismissed\r\n     from superiorships before he died. For as the Mère de Bréchard\r\n     says, there are more opportunities to humble oneself, to mortify\r\n     oneself, to throw oneself entirely on God, in them than in anything\r\n     else. I return the life of S. Catherine of Genoa. I like it so\r\n     much. It is a very singular and suggestive life. I am so glad she\r\n     accepted the being Directress of the Hospital. For I think it was\r\n     much better for her to make the Hospital servants go right than to\r\n     receive their \"injures\"--however submissively--much better for the\r\n     poor Patients, I mean.\r\n\r\n     I am quite ashamed to keep Ste. Thérése so long. But there is a\r\n     good deal of reading in her. And I am only able to read at\r\n     night--and then not always a large, close-printed book. Pray say if\r\n     I shall send her back. And I will borrow her again from you perhaps\r\n     some day. I am so sorry about poor S. Gonzaga's troubles. I know\r\n     what those Committees are. I have had to deal with them almost all\r\n     my life.\r\n\r\n     My strength has failed more than usually of late. And I don't think\r\n     I have much more work in me--not, at least, if it is to continue of\r\n     this harassing sort. God called me to Hospital work (as I fondly\r\n     thought, for life)--but since then to Army work--but with a promise\r\n     that I should go back to Hospital--as I thought as a Nurse, but as\r\n     I now think, as a Patient. But St. Catherine of Siena says: \"Et\r\n     toutesfois je permets cela luy advenir, afin qu'il soit plus\r\n     soigneux de fuyr soi mesme, & de venir & recourir à moy ... et\r\n     qu'il considère que par amour je luy donne le moyen de tirer hors\r\n     le chef de la vraye humilité, se reputant indigne de la paix &\r\n     repos de pensée, comme mes autres serviteurs--& au contraire se\r\n     reputant digne des peines qu'il souffre,\" etc.\r\n\r\n     My sister and her family come to spend here two or three nights\r\n     occasionally to see friends. But I was only able to see her for ten\r\n     minutes, and my good brother-in-law, who is one of the best and\r\n     kindest of men, not at all--nor his children.... I sent you back\r\n     St. Francis de Sales, with many thanks. I liked him in his old\r\n     dress. I like that story where the man loses his crown of\r\n     martyrdom, because he will not be reconciled with his enemy. It is\r\n     a sound lesson. I am going to send you back S. Francis Xavier. His\r\n     is a life I always like to study as well as those of all the early\r\n     Jesuit fathers. But how much they did--and how little I do.... Ever\r\n     my dearest Revd. Mother's loving and grateful, F. N.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale never lost sight of the end in the means. She was doing\r\n\"God's work\" in the \"War Office.\" She thought it was \"little\" that she\r\ndid, for it is often the hardest workers who thus deem themselves the\r\nmost unprofitable servants. And the work was often drudgery; yet through\r\nit all she had inspiration from her memories of heroism in the Army, for\r\nwhose \"salvation\" she was working. \"I have seen to-day [from my\r\nwindow],\" she wrote to her mother in 1863, \"the first Levée, since all\r\nare dead whom I wished to please. A melancholy sight to me. Yet I like\r\nthe pomp and pageant of the old veterans covered with well-earned\r\ncrosses. To me who saw them earned, no vain pageant. It is like the Dead\r\nMarch in _Saul_--to me, who heard it on the battle-field, no vain sound,\r\nbut full of deep and glorious sadness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                      HELPERS, VISITORS, AND FRIENDS\r\n\r\n                                (1862-1866)\r\n\r\n\r\n     To be alone is nothing; but to be without sympathy in a crowd, this\r\n     is to be confined in solitude. Where there is want of sympathy, of\r\n     attraction, given and returned, must it not be a feeling of\r\n     starvation?--FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE: _Suggestions for Thought_\r\n     (1860).\r\n\r\n     Friendship should help the friends to work out better the work of\r\n     life.--BENJAMIN JOWETT (1866).\r\n\r\nThe years of Miss Nightingale's life, described in this Part, were\r\nperhaps those of her hardest and most unremitting work. Throughout these\r\nyears, until August 1866, she lived entirely in London or immediately\r\nnear to it.[60] Her quarters were in lodgings or in hired houses, until\r\nNovember 1865, when her father took a house for her for a term of years\r\nin South Street (No. 35), near her married sister. This house (No. 10\r\nwhen the street was renumbered) was the one that she occupied till her\r\ndeath. I think that there was not a single day during the period from\r\n1862 to 1866 upon which she was not engaged in one part or another of\r\nthe manifold work described in preceding chapters. And there was much\r\nother work as well, begun in these years, but brought to completion\r\nlater, which will be described in a subsequent Part. She gave account of\r\nher days to Madame Mohl (Jan. 24, 1865), and recalled what \"a poor woman\r\nwith 13 children, who took in washing, once said to me--her idea of\r\nheaven was to have one hour a day in which she could do nothing.\" Yet\r\nall that Miss Nightingale did was done forcefully. \"I am completely\r\nreassured as to the state of your health,\" wrote her old friend\r\nMr. Reeve (Jan. 21, 1865), in reply to some communication on Indian\r\naffairs, \"by the Homeric frame of mind you are in. You will live an\r\nhundred years. You will write a Sanitariad or a Lawrentiad in 24 books,\r\nand Lord Derby will translate you into all known languages. Stanley will\r\nbe Lord Derby then, but this will only make the thing more appropriate.\"\r\nBut her work, though very vigorous, was very hard. It was done, not as\r\nin the Crimean war, in the excitement of immediate action, nor, as in\r\nthe years succeeding her return, with the daily aid and sympathy of her\r\n\"dear Master.\" It was her hardest work for another reason, already\r\nmentioned: she was for a large part of this later period, almost\r\nbedridden. She would get up and dress in order to receive the more\r\nimportant of her men-visitors, but the effort tired her greatly.\r\n\r\n  [60] Her places of residence in 1862 and 1863 have been given above,\r\n       p. 24. In 1864 she lived at 32 (now No. 4) South Street, the\r\n       Verneys' house (Jan.); at 115 Park Street (Feb.-July); at 7 Oak\r\n       Hill Park, Hampstead (Aug.-Oct.). She was at 27 Norfolk Street\r\n       from Nov. 1864 to May 1, 1865. During May and June 1865 and again\r\n       in Oct., she was at 34 (now No. 8) South Street; in July-Sept.,\r\n       she was at Hampstead.\r\n\r\nThe amount of work which she did under these conditions is\r\nextraordinary, and the question arises how she did it. A principal\r\nexplanation is to be found in Dr. Sutherland. The reader may have\r\nnoticed once or twice in letters written by Miss Nightingale such\r\nexpressions as \"We are doing\" so and so, or \"Can such and such be sent\r\nto us.\" The plural was not royal; it signified she had explained at an\r\nearlier time to Sidney Herbert, \"the troops and me;\" but it also\r\nsignified, during the years with which this Part is concerned, herself\r\nand Dr. Sutherland. She wrote incessantly, but even so she could hardly\r\nhave accomplished her daily tasks without some clerical assistance. She\r\nknew an immense deal about the subjects with which she dealt, and her\r\nmemory was both precise and tenacious; but there were limits to her\r\npowers of acquisition, and cases often arose in which personal\r\ninspection or personal moving about in search of information were\r\nessential. In all these ways Dr. Sutherland's help was constant. He\r\nwielded a ready pen. He was one of the leading sanitary experts of the\r\nday. His professional and official connections gave him access to\r\nvarious sources of information. His regular work was on the Army\r\nSanitary Commission; and for the rest, he placed himself at Miss\r\nNightingale's beck and call. Mrs. Sutherland was her private secretary\r\nat this time for household affairs, such as searching for lodgings and\r\nengaging servants; her accounts were still kept, and much of her\r\nmiscellaneous correspondence conducted by her uncle, Mr. Sam Smith;[61]\r\nbut in all official business, her factotum was Dr. Sutherland. A large\r\nproportion of the notes, drafts, and memoranda, belonging to these\r\nyears, among her papers, is in Dr. Sutherland's handwriting, and\r\nsometimes it is impossible to determine how much of the work is hers and\r\nhow much his. Often he took down heads from her conversation, and put\r\nthe matter into shape; at other times he submitted drafts for her\r\napproval or correction, and took copies of the letters ultimately\r\ndispatched.\r\n\r\n  [61] She was still so beset by begging letters, that Mr. Smith had a\r\n       notice inserted in the _Times_ of April 29, 1864, to the effect\r\n       that she could not answer them or return any papers enclosed to her.\r\n\r\nHow indispensable to her was Dr. Sutherland's help comes out from some\r\ncorrespondence of 1865. Captain Galton had sent private word that there\r\nwas talk at the War Office of appointing Dr. Sutherland Commissioner to\r\ninquire into an outbreak of cholera at some of the Mediterranean\r\nStations. Miss Nightingale was greatly perturbed. \"We are full of Indian\r\nbusiness,\" she wrote (Nov. 1), \"which must be settled before Parliament\r\nmeets. Lord Stanley has consented to take it up. And I have pledged\r\nmyself to have it all ready--a thing I should never have done if I had\r\nthought Dr. Sutherland would be sent abroad. You are yourself aware that\r\nCalcutta water-supply has been sent home to us (at my request), and Dr.\r\nS. told me this morning that _he and I_ should have to write the\r\nReport.\" And again (Dec. 15): \"For God's sake, if you can, prevent Dr.\r\nSutherland going.\" She had begged that at any rate nothing should be\r\nsaid to Dr. Sutherland himself about it unless the mission were\r\nirrevocably decided upon: \"he is so childish that if he heard of this\r\nMalta and Gibraltar business he would instantly declare there was\r\nnothing to keep him in England.\" The \"child\"--the \"baby\" of some earlier\r\ncorrespondence[62]--only liked a little change sometimes. Indispensable\r\nthough he was to his task-mistress, he yet, as in former days, vexed\r\nher. She thought him lacking in method, and with her this was one of the\r\nunpardonable sins. He sometimes forgot what he had done with, or had\r\npromised to do with, a particular Paper; he was even capable of\r\nmislaying a Blue-book. He was often behind hand with tasks imposed upon\r\nhim. His temperament was a little volatile, and in one impeachment he is\r\naccused of \"incurable looseness of thought.\" If this were so (which I\r\ntake leave to doubt), the defect must have been congenital, or long\r\nservice under Miss Nightingale would have cured it.\r\n\r\n  [62] See Vol. I. pp. 370, 383.\r\n\r\nPartly because Dr. Sutherland's manner sometimes teased her, partly\r\nbecause he was deaf, and partly owing to her own physical disabilities,\r\nMiss Nightingale developed at this time a method of communicating with\r\nhim which, during later years, became familiar to all but her most\r\nprivileged friends. The visitor on being admitted was ushered into a\r\nsitting-room on the ground-floor, and given pencil and paper. It were\r\nwell for him that what he wrote should be lucid and concise. The message\r\nwas carried upstairs into the Presence, and an answer, similarly\r\nwritten, was brought down. And to such interchange would the interview\r\nbe confined. With Dr. Sutherland, Miss Nightingale had many personal\r\ninterviews; their business was often too detailed, too intricate, too\r\nconfidential, to be conducted otherwise; but there are hundreds of\r\nletters, received from other people, upon which (in blank spaces or on\r\nspare sheets) there are pencilled notes conveying answers or messages to\r\nDr. Sutherland. \"Well, you know I have already said that to Lord\r\nStanley. I can't do more.\" \"Yes, you _must_.\" \"Oh, Lord bless you,\r\n_No_.\" \"You want me to decide in order that you may do the reverse.\"\r\n\"Can you answer a plain question?\" \"You have forgotten all we talked\r\nabout.\" \"I cannot flatter you on your lucidity.\" \"I do not shake hands\r\ntill the Abstract is done; and I do not leave London till it is done.\"\r\n\"You told me positively there was nothing to be done. There is\r\neverything to be done.\" \"Why did you tell me that tremendous _banger_?\r\nWas it to prevent my worrying you?\" \"Nothing has been done. I have been\r\nso anxious; but the more zeal I feel, the more indifferent you.\"\r\nSometimes he strikes work, or refuses to answer, signing his name by a\r\ndrawing of a dry pump with a handle marked \"F.N.\": \"Your pump is dry.\r\nIndia to stand over.\" Sometimes he makes fun of her business-like\r\nmethods, and heads his notes \"Ref.000000/000.\" Sometimes he pleads\r\nillness. \"I am very sorry, but I was too ill to know anything except\r\nthat I was ill.\" Often he received visitors for her, or entertained them\r\non her behalf at luncheon or dinner. \"These two people have come. Will\r\nyou see them for me? I have explained who you are.\" \"Was the luncheon\r\ngood? Did he eat?\" \"Did he walk?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then he's a liar; he told me\r\nhe couldn't move.\" In 1865-66 Dr. and Mrs. Sutherland had moved house\r\nfrom Finchley to Norwood. Miss Nightingale complained of this\r\nremoteness. Dr. Sutherland dated his letters from \"The Gulf.\" He stayed\r\nthere sometimes, complaining of indisposition, instead of coming up to\r\nSouth Street where business was pressing. Miss Nightingale did not take\r\nthe reason kindly, and his letters begin, \"Respected Enemy\" or \"Dear\r\nhowling epileptic Friend.\" One morning (June 23, 1865) Dr. Sutherland\r\nwent to the private view of the Herbert Hospital--a great occasion to\r\nMiss Nightingale. In the afternoon he called and sent up to her a short\r\nnote of what he had seen. \"And that is all you condescend to tell me.\r\nAnd I get it at 4 o'clock.\" Of course, they understood each other; they\r\nwere old and intimate friends. But I think that the man who thus served\r\nwith Miss Nightingale must have had a great and disinterested zeal for\r\nthe causes in which they were engaged; and that there must have been\r\nsomething at once formidable and fascinating in the Lady-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThe pressure of work during these years caused Miss Nightingale to close\r\nher doors resolutely. She did indeed see her father often; her mother\r\nand sister occasionally, though she did not press them to come. Other\r\nrelations and many of her friends felt aggrieved that she would not\r\naccept help which they would have liked to give. But she had a rule of\r\nlife to which she adhered firmly. There was so much strength available,\r\nlikely enough (as she still supposed) to be ended by early death; there\r\nwas so much public work to be done; there was no strength to spare for\r\nfamily or friends, except in so far as they helped, and did not hinder,\r\nthe public work. She saw nurses and matrons from time to time: they were\r\nparts of her life-work. She saw Lady Herbert and Mrs. Bracebridge: they\r\nwere parts of her work in the past. She never omitted to write to Lady\r\nHerbert on the anniversary of Lord Herbert's death, though their\r\nfriendship lost something of its former intimacy when in 1865 Lady\r\nHerbert joined the Church of Rome. Other friends were seldom admitted.\r\nLetters to an old friend, who was sometimes received and sometimes\r\nturned away, explain Miss Nightingale's point of view:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Madame Mohl._) 115 PARK STREET, _July_ 30 [1864]. You will be\r\n     doing me a favour if you come to me. August 2 is a terrible\r\n     anniversary to me. And I shall not have my usual solace, for\r\n     Mrs. Bracebridge has always come to spend that day with me, and I\r\n     am sure she would have come this year, but I could not tell whether\r\n     I should be able to get Sir John Lawrence's things off by that\r\n     time. It does me good to be with you, as with Mrs. Clive, because\r\n     it reduces individual struggles to general formulæ. It does me\r\n     harm, intensely alone as I am, to be with people who do the\r\n     reverse. But it is incorrect to say, as Mrs. Clive does, that \"I\r\n     will not let people help me,\" or, as others do, that \"no one can\r\n     help me.\" Any body could have helped me who knew how to read and\r\n     write and what o'clock it is.\r\n\r\n     _June_ 23 [1865], SOUTH STREET. CLARKEY MOHL DARLING--How I should\r\n     like to see you now. But it is quite, quite, quite impossible. I am\r\n     sure no one ever gave up so much to live, who longed so much to\r\n     die, as I do and give up daily. It is the only credit I claim. I\r\n     will live if I can. I shall be so glad if I can't. I am overwhelmed\r\n     with business. And I have an Indian functionary now in London,\r\n     whose work is cut out for him every day at my house. I scarcely\r\n     even have half an hour's ease. Would you tell M. Mohl this, if you\r\n     are writing, about the Queen of Holland's proposed visit to me? I\r\n     really feel it a great honour that she wishes to see me. She is a\r\n     Queen of Queens. But it is quite, quite, quite impossible....\r\n     (_Oct_. 4 [1865]). I am so weak, no one knows how weak I am.\r\n     Yesterday because I saw Dr. Sutherland for a few minutes in the\r\n     afternoon, after the morning's work, and my good Mrs. Sutherland\r\n     for a few minutes after him, I was with a spasm of the heart till 7\r\n     o'clock this morning and nearly unfit for work all to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the case of one distinguished visitor to London, Miss Nightingale\r\nmade an exception. This was Garibaldi. She was a sworn Garibaldian, as\r\nwe have heard. He wished to see her; she was famous in Italy, and she\r\nhad subscribed to his funds. Friends told her that she might be able to\r\ninfluence the hero in the direction of her own interests, and with some\r\ntrepidation she prepared herself to receive him. \"I think,\" wrote\r\nMr. Jowett, \"that we may trust God to give us his own calmness and\r\nclearness on any great occasion such as this is. I hope you will inspire\r\nGaribaldi for the future and not pain him too much about the past. Ten\r\nyears more of such a life as his might accomplish almost anything for\r\nItaly in the way of military organization and sanitary and moral\r\nimprovement--if he could only see that his duty is not to break the yet\r\nimmature strength of Italy against Austrian fortresses.\" Miss\r\nNightingale prepared for the \"great occasion\" by jotting down in French\r\nwhat she would try to say. \"Eh bien! in five years you have made\r\nItaly--the work of five centuries. You have worked a miracle. But even\r\nyou, mon Général, could not make a steam-engine in five minutes. And\r\nItaly has to be consolidated into a strong machine, like those which you\r\nhave been seeing at Bedford,\" and so forth, and so forth. She tried to\r\nkeep the fact of the interview secret, but it was chronicled in the\r\nnewspapers[63]:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Harriet Martineau._) 115 PARK ST., _April 28_\r\n     [1864]. You may have heard that I have seen Garibaldi. I resisted\r\n     it with all my might, but I was obliged to do it. I asked no one to\r\n     look at him--told no one--and he came in my brother-in-law's\r\n     carriage, hoping that no one would know. But it all failed. We had\r\n     a long interview by ourselves. I was more struck with the greatness\r\n     of that noble heart--full of bitterness, yet not bitter--and with\r\n     the smallness of the administrative capacity, than even I expected.\r\n     He raves for a Government \"like the English.\" But he knows no more\r\n     what it is than his King Bomba did. (It was for this that I was to\r\n     speak to him.) One year of such a life, as I have led for ten\r\n     years, would tell him more of how one has to give and take with a\r\n     \"representative Government\" than all his Utopia and his \"ideal.\"\r\n     You will smile. But he reminds me of Plato. He talks about the\r\n     \"ideal good\" and the \"ideal bad\"; about his not caring for\r\n     \"repubblica\" or for \"monarchia\": he only wants \"the right.\" Alas!\r\n     alas! What a pity--that utter impracticability! I pity _me_ very\r\n     much. And of all my years, this last has been the hardest. But now\r\n     I see that no _man_ would have put up with what I have put up with\r\n     for ten years, to do even the little I have done--which is about a\r\n     hundredth part of what I have tried for. Garibaldi looks flushed\r\n     and very ill, worn and depressed--not excited. He looks as if he\r\n     stood and went thro' all this as he stood under the bullets of\r\n     Aspromonte--a duty which he was here to perform. The madness of the\r\n     Italians here in urging him is inconceivable.\r\n\r\n  [63] See the _Times_, April 18, 1864. The interview took place on Sunday\r\n       afternoon April 17. On the day before, Garibaldi had been at\r\n       Bedford.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, we may safely infer, did not inspire Garibaldi with\r\ndivine fervour for sanitary reform or any merely administrative\r\nprogress. Administration in any sort was foreign to his genius. But she\r\nfelt, after the interview no less than before, that it was a great\r\noccasion to her. The interview took place at 115 Park Street, a house\r\nbelonging to the Grosvenor Hotel, and she presented the Hotel with a\r\nbust of Garibaldi as a memento of the occasion.\r\n\r\nAnother of her heroes was Abraham Lincoln, of whom she wrote this\r\nappreciation[64]:--\r\n\r\n     34 SOUTH STREET, _June_ 20 [1865]. DEAR SIR--I have not dared to\r\n     press in with my feeble word of sympathy upon your over-taxed time\r\n     and energy, when all Europe was pouring in upon you with its heartfelt\r\n     sympathy. My experience has been infinitesimally small. Still, small\r\n     as it is, it has been of historical events. And I can never remember\r\n     the time--not even when the colossal calamity of the Crimea was first\r\n     made known to us,--not even when we lost our own Albert (and our\r\n     Albert was no common hero--remember that it was no Sovereign, but it\r\n     was Washington, whom he held up as an example to himself and his)--I\r\n     can never remember the time when so deep and strong a cry of feeling\r\n     has gone up from the world, in all its length and breadth, and in all\r\n     its classes, as has gone up for you and yours--in your great trial:\r\n     Mr. Lincoln's death. As some one said of him, he will hold \"the\r\n     purest and the greatest place in history.\" I trust and believe that\r\n     the deed which will spring up from that noble grave will be worthy of\r\n     it. I will not take up your time with weak expression of a deep\r\n     sympathy. Sincerely yours, FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\n  [64] In a letter to Mr. Dennis R. Alward.\r\n\r\nAt home, the political event which most moved her was the death of Lord\r\nPalmerston:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Dr. Farr._) 34 SOUTH STREET, _Oct._ 19 [1865]\r\n     Ld. Palmerston is a great loss. I speak for the country and myself.\r\n     He was a powerful protector to me--especially since Sidney\r\n     Herbert's death. I never asked him to do anything--you may be sure\r\n     I did not ask him often--but he did it--for the last nine years. He\r\n     did not do himself justice. If the right thing was to be done, he\r\n     made a joke, but he did it. He will not leave his impress on the\r\n     age--but he did the country good service. Except L. Napoleon, whose\r\n     death might be the greatest good _or_ the greatest evil, I doubt\r\n     whether there is any man's loss which will so affect Europe.... He\r\n     was at heart the most liberal man we had left. I have lost, in him,\r\n     a powerful friend. I hear spoken of as his successors--Clarendon,\r\n     Russell, Granville. Ld. Clarendon it is said the Queen wishes--and\r\n     she has been corresponding with him privately--perhaps by Ld.\r\n     Palmerston's own desire. But I believe the real question is, under\r\n     which (if any) of these, your Mr. Gladstone will consent to remain\r\n     in office and be Leader of the Ho. of C. Not one of these men will\r\n     manage the cabinet as Ld. Palmerston did. But I daresay you have\r\n     more trustworthy information than I have. I would Ld. Palmerston\r\n     had lived another Session. We should have got something done at the\r\n     Poor Law Board, which we shall not now.[65] Ld. Russell is so\r\n     queer-tempered. I quite dread his Premiership, if it comes.\r\n\r\n  [65] On this subject, see below, p. 133.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's interest in the working classes led her in 1865 to\r\ndraft a scheme which, in some aspects of it, forestalled ideas of a\r\nlater generation of social reformers. Mr. Gladstone had recently passed\r\nan Act enabling a depositor's accumulations in the Post Office Savings\r\nBank to be invested in the purchase either of an Annuity or an\r\nInsurance. It would be very advisable, she suggested, to add to these\r\nmethods of saving facilities for the purchase of small freeholds. There\r\nwas nothing that the working men more coveted than the ownership of a\r\nhouse or a piece of land. An extension of small ownership would satisfy\r\na legitimate craving, increase the motives to thrift, and raise the\r\nsocial position and independence of the working classes. If the adoption\r\nof the scheme would necessitate the enfranchisement of leaseholds, so\r\nmuch the better. Such were Miss Nightingale's ideas, and under different\r\nforms and by different methods they have occupied the attention of\r\nsocial reformers to this day. She submitted her scheme to Mr. Villiers,\r\nPresident of the Poor Law Board, who seems to have been somewhat\r\nfavourable to it. Then she tackled the Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nartfully suggesting that her scheme was merely, on the one hand, a\r\nslight development of his \"most successful Savings Bank measures,\" and,\r\non the other, an indirect means of meeting his earnest desire to extend\r\nthe suffrage. But Mr. Gladstone was not to be cajoled. \"It would not\r\ndo,\" he told her, \"for Government to become land-jobbers\"--an opinion\r\nwhich has not been shared, it would seem, by some of Mr. Gladstone's\r\nsuccessors. He had further suggested that the scheme should be\r\nsubmitted, in its legal aspects, to his friend Mr. Roundell Palmer, and\r\nMr. Palmer, after reading it, opined that the law already gave adequate\r\nfacilities for the purchase of freeholds by working men and others. Miss\r\nNightingale then took other legal opinions with a view to meeting\r\nobjections; but she presently gave up this addition to her schemes. \"It\r\nwas certainly,\" she said, \"the wildest of ideas for me to undertake it\r\njust now when I can scarcely do what I have already undertaken.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nThough Miss Nightingale saw little of her friends or relations at this\r\ntime, she constantly corresponded with them. There are many letters\r\nwhich tell of her grief at the death of her cousin, Miss Hilary Bonham\r\nCarter: \"the golden bowl is broken,\" she wrote to Madame Mohl (Sept. 8,\r\n1865), \"and it was the very purest gold I have ever known.\" There are\r\nletters from many correspondents--Lady Augusta Bruce, for instance, and\r\nMrs. William Cowper--which show how deeply they had been touched by Miss\r\nNightingale's letters of condolence. Her own griefs left room for\r\nsympathy with those of others:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Dr. Farr._) HAMPSTEAD, _August_ 5 [1864].... I am sorry to\r\n     hear of your griefs. I do not find that mine close my heart to\r\n     those of others--and I should be more than anxious to hear of\r\n     _yours_--you who have been our faithful friend for so many years. I\r\n     had heard of your father's death, but not of any other loss. Sidney\r\n     Herbert has been dead three years on the 2nd. And these three years\r\n     have been nothing but a slow undermining of all he has done (at the\r\n     W.O.). This is the bitterest grief. The mere personal craving after\r\n     a beloved presence I feel as nothing. A few years at most, and that\r\n     will be over. But the other is never over. For me, I look forward\r\n     to pursuing God's work soon in another of his worlds. I do not look\r\n     forward with any craving to seeing again those I have lost (in the\r\n     _very_ next world)--sure that that will all come in His own good\r\n     time--and sure of my willingness to work in whichever of His worlds\r\n     I am most wanted, with or without those dear fellow-workers, as He\r\n     pleases. But this does not at all soothe the pain of seeing men\r\n     wantonly deface the work _here_ of some of His best workers. But I\r\n     shall bear your faith in mind--that good works never really die.\r\n     Alas! good Tulloch. But I think his work was done. Pray, if you\r\n     speak of him, remember--had it not been for him, where would our\r\n     two Army Sanitary enquiries have been?\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's large circle of correspondents kept her in touch with\r\nthe literary, as well as with the political, world. She suffered greatly\r\nfrom sleeplessness and read much at night. She seldom read a book\r\nwithout finding something original or characteristic to say about it.\r\n\"Lately,\" she wrote to M. Mohl (Jan. 24, 1865), \"I have read an English\r\ntranslation of the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám. The way it interests me is\r\ntheologically. Otherwise he seems a poor weak mixture of Mahomet and a\r\nMephistopheles. But the arguments which he despises seem to me just the\r\nreal arguments, the only arguments, if only we believe in a Perfect God,\r\nfor eternal existence. Do tell me a little about this, and about the\r\nSufis and Firdausi--as regards their belief in a God, and whether the\r\nGod was good or bad, if any.\" Omar was new to M. Mohl. Miss Nightingale\r\nlent him Fitz-Gerald's version,[66] and M. Mohl read the original. \"The\r\ntidings,\" she wrote (April 21), \"that you may perhaps print Al Khayyám's\r\nquatrains is diffusing joy among a (not large but) select circle, I\r\nhaving communicated it in the 'proper quarter' (see how we are all\r\ntarred with the same official stick). If you send me a copy, I shall\r\nimmediately become a personage of importance.\" \"I read some of Madame\r\nRoland's _Memoires_,\" she wrote to Madame Mohl (May 20, 1865): \"but, do\r\nyou know, I was so disappointed to find out that her patriotism was\r\ninspired by a lover. Not that I care much about virtue: I do think\r\n'virtue' by itself a very second-rate virtue. But because I did hope\r\nthat here was one woman who cared for _respublica_ as alone, or as\r\nchief, among her cares.\" \"Do\" (to Madame Mohl, Sept. 8, 1865), \"read if\r\nyou have not read Swinburne's _Atalanta in Calydon_. Forgive it its\r\nbeing an imitation of a Greek play. That is its worst fault. As you said\r\nof Macaulay's _Lays_, They are like an old man in a pinafore; or as I\r\nshould say of this, It is like a Puritan togged out as a Priest going to\r\nsay mass. But read it. The Atalanta herself, though she is only a sort\r\nof Ginn and not a woman at all, has more reality, more character, more\r\nindividuality (to use a bad word) than all the jeunes premières in all\r\nthe men novelists I ever have read--Walter Scott, Lytton Bulwer, and all\r\nof them. But then Atalanta is not a sound incarnation of any 'social or\r\neconomic principle'--is she? So men will say.\"\r\n\r\n  [66] The copy in question was lent by Tennyson to Jowett, and by him to\r\n       Miss Nightingale.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nOn higher themes the correspondent to whom Miss Nightingale wrote most\r\nfully from her heart was from this time forth Mr. Jowett. Their\r\nacquaintance, at first confined to paper, had begun, as described in an\r\nearlier chapter, with correspondence about her _Suggestions for\r\nThought_. The work had greatly interested him, and from time to time he\r\ncontinued to write to her about it. He wished her to do something with\r\nher \"Suggestions,\" but to rewrite them in a more connected form and a\r\ngentler mood, and he sometimes gave hints for an irony less bitter than\r\nhers. Her letters to him are no longer in existence, except in the case\r\nof a few of which she preserved copies; but it is clear from the tenor\r\nof the correspondence on the other side that she was already (1862)\r\ngiving to him much of her intimate confidence. She had now met a new\r\nfriend who was capable of entering into her inmost and highest thoughts,\r\nnot indeed always with agreement, but always with a sympathetic\r\nunderstanding. \"As you have shown me so much confidence,\" he presently\r\nwrote, \"I feel the strongest wish to help you in any way that I can\r\nwithout intruding.\" And again: \"I cannot but wish you (as sincerely as I\r\never desired anything) unabated hope and trust and resolve to continue\r\nyour work to the end, and many rays of light to cheer the way.\" A little\r\nlater, drawing a bow at a venture, Mr. Jowett wondered whether she was\r\nengaged about Indian sanitary matters? He had \"a reason for being\r\ninterested about them which is that I lost my two brothers in India.\"\r\nMiss Nightingale, as we have heard, was interested in nothing else so\r\nintently at this time, and here was a fresh bond of sympathy. She asked\r\nwhether, knowing what he did of her religious views, he would come and\r\nadminister the Sacrament to her, as she was entirely unable to leave her\r\nroom. \"I shall be very glad,\" he wrote (Oct. 3), \"to give you the\r\nSacrament. I am sure that many other clergymen would be equally glad.\r\nWould you like Mr. and Mrs. Smith, or any of their family, to join you?\"\r\nThe Sacrament was often thus administered, and Miss Nightingale's most\r\nintimate friends--such as Mrs. Bracebridge--or some of her family,\r\ngenerally partook of the rite with her. On one of the earlier of these\r\noccasions, Mr. Jowett met her parents, and in 1862 paid the first of his\r\nvisits, which afterwards became frequent, to them in the country. He\r\noften figures in their letters as \"that great and good man,\" or \"that\r\ntrue saint, Mr. Jowett.\" And from this date also began his frequent\r\nvisits--usually many times a year--to Miss Nightingale herself; indeed\r\nhe was seldom, if ever, in London without spending an afternoon with\r\nher. If she had friends staying in her house--such as M. and Madame\r\nMohl--he would sometimes come in to dine with them.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Miss Nightingale,\" wrote Mr. Jowett (Oct. 28), \"I shall always\r\nregard the circumstance of having given you the Communion as a solemn\r\nevent in my life which is a call to devote myself to the service of God\r\nand men (if He will give me the power to do so). Your example will often\r\ncome before me, especially if I have occasion to continue my work under\r\nbodily suffering. There is something that I want to say to you which I\r\nhardly know how to express.\" And then followed the first of what became\r\na long series of spiritual admonitions. Mr. Jowett had, it is clear, a\r\nvery high opinion of Miss Nightingale's genius, the most sincere\r\nadmiration for her self-devotion, and a deep affection for her. But he\r\nthought that she was in some ways not using her life to the best\r\nadvantage, and that her state of physical and mental suffering was in\r\nsome measure the result of a too impetuous temper. In letter after\r\nletter, full of a beautiful and delicate sympathy, he whispered into her\r\nears counsels of calm, of trust, of moderation. She seems to have kept\r\nhim informed of every move in her crusades, and he was constantly afraid\r\nthat she would fight too fiercely or even (in this case a quite needless\r\nfear) come out into the open. \"The gift of being invisible,\" he wrote\r\n(April 22, 1863), \"is much to be desired by any one who exercises a good\r\ninfluence over others. Though Deborah and Barak work together, Sisera\r\nthe Captain of the Host must not suspect that he has been delivered into\r\nthe hands of a woman.\" \"I hope\" (March 1865) \"that you won't leave your\r\nincognito. It would seriously injure your influence if you were known to\r\nhave influence. (Did you know the Baron Stockmar whom Sir Robert Peel\r\ncalled one of the most influential persons in Europe? Hardly any one in\r\nEngland excepting Kings and Queens knew of his existence. That was a\r\nmodel for that sort of life.) If you answer (anonymously, as I hope, if\r\nat all), may I beg you to answer with facts only and without a trace of\r\nfeeling?\" When he applauds some stroke, he urges her to find rest and\r\ncomfort in the victory. \"All this,\" he wrote (Feb. 26, 1865), \"I firmly\r\nbelieve would not have been accomplished but for your clearness of sight\r\nand intensity of purpose. Is not this a thing to thank God about? I was\r\nreading in Grote an account of an attempted Spartan revolution in the\r\ntimes of Agesilaus. One of the great objects of the Ephori was to keep\r\nthe Spartan youth from getting under the influence of a woman (name\r\nunknown) who was stirring the rebellion. Do you not think that woman may\r\nhave been you in some former state of existence?\" Miss Nightingale,\r\nperhaps in some justification for her eagerness in action, opened her\r\nheart fully to Mr. Jowett about her sense of loss in Sidney Herbert's\r\ndeath; explaining her loneliness in work, and yet her overmastering\r\ndesire to complete, while strength was still granted to her, the \"joint\r\nwork\" of her friend and herself. \"I have often felt,\" he replied (Aug.\r\n7, 1865), \"what a wreck and ruin Lord Herbert's death must have been to\r\nyou. You had done so much for him and he had grown so rapidly in himself\r\nand in public estimation that there seemed no limits to what he might\r\nhave effected. He might have been one of the most popular and powerful\r\nPrime Ministers in this country--the man to carry us through the social\r\nand ecclesiastical questions that are springing up. And you would have\r\nhad a great part in his work and filled him with every noble and useful\r\nambition. Do not suppose that I don't feel and understand all this. (And\r\nyou might have made me Dean of Christ Church: the only preferment that I\r\nwould like to have, and I would have reformed the University and bullied\r\nthe Canons.) But it has pleased God that all this should not be, and it\r\nmust please us too, and we must carry on the struggle under greater\r\ndifficulties, with more of hard and painful labour and less of success,\r\nstill never flinching while life lasts.\" Never flinching, but never\r\nfretting or fuming: that was the burden of Mr. Jowett's exhortations. \"I\r\nsometimes think,\" he had written (July 9, 1865), \"that you ought\r\nseriously to consider how your work may be carried on, not with less\r\nenergy, but in a calmer spirit. Think that the work of God neither\r\nhastes nor rests, and that we should go about it in the spirit of order\r\nwhich prevails in the world. I am not blaming the past (who would blame\r\nyou who devote your life to the good of others?). But I want the peace\r\nof God to settle on the future. Perhaps you will feel that in urging\r\nthis I really can form no notion of your sufferings. Alas, dear friend,\r\nI am afraid that this is true. Still I must beg you to keep your mind\r\nabove them. Is that motive vain of being made perfect through\r\nsuffering?\" It is an idle speculation to wonder whether persons who\r\nhave done great things in the world would have done as much or more or\r\nbetter if they had been other than they were. Calm is well; but it is\r\nnot always the spring of action. If Miss Nightingale had been less eager\r\nand impetuous, she might, after her return from the Crimea, have done\r\nnothing at all. But perhaps already, in moments of weariness during the\r\nbattle, and increasingly as the shadows lengthened into the pensive\r\nevening of her days, she may have felt that there was some truth in the\r\nsoothing counsels of Mr. Jowett's friendship.\r\n\r\nThat Miss Nightingale reciprocated his feelings of affectionate esteem\r\nis shown very clearly by the way in which she received his admonitions.\r\nShe was not usually meek under even the gentlest reproaches of her\r\nfriends; but, so far as Mr. Jowett's letters tell the story, she never\r\nresented anything he said; she expressed nothing but gratitude. I do not\r\nsuppose that she never retorted. He advised her, as he advised\r\neverybody, to read Boswell. I gather from one of his letters that she\r\nmay have reminded him of Dr. Johnson's love of a good hater, for\r\nMr. Jowett promises to try and satisfy her a little better in that\r\nrespect in the future. And, as far as it was in him to do so, he seems\r\nto have kept his word. \"Hang the Hebdomadal Council,\" he wrote; or, of a\r\ncertain meeting of another body, \"I was opposed by two fools and a\r\nknave.\" There are passages about \"rascals\" and \"rogue Elephants\" and\r\n\"beasts,\" which are almost as downright as was Miss Nightingale herself\r\nin this sort. She returned to the full the sympathy which he gave to\r\nher. She was solicitous about his health. He promised to cut down his\r\nhours of reading, and never to work any more after midnight. \"I cannot\r\nresist such a remonstrance as yours. I think that you would batter the\r\ngates of heaven or hell. Seriously, I shall think of your letter as long\r\nas I live, dear friend.\" She asked to be kept informed of every move in\r\nthe academical disputes which concerned him, the judgment in the case of\r\n_Essays and Reviews_, the dispute about the Greek Professorship, and so\r\nforth. He told her even of stupidities at College meetings--\"not to be\r\nbeaten,\" he said of one, \"even by your War Office.\" \"I think you are the\r\nonly person,\" he wrote (1865), \"who encourages me about my work at\r\nOxford. I cannot be too grateful for your words.\" \"I am delighted,\" he\r\nwrote again (Oct. 27, 1866), \"to have a friend who cares two straws\r\nwhether I succeeded in a matter at Oxford.\" She, as is clear from his\r\nletters, wrote to him, not only about her struggles and interests, but\r\nalso about his; and he, on his side, discussed all her problems. He\r\nwanted her to spend herself no longer \"on conflicts with Government\r\noffices,\" but to devote her mind to some literary work in which\r\nsuccessful effect would depend only on herself. In such work, moreover,\r\nhe could perhaps help her. She, on her side, would like to help him with\r\na sermon, the preparation of which was teasing him, and there is a long\r\ndraft amongst her papers of the heads of a discourse, suggested by her,\r\non the relation of religion to politics. \"I sometimes use _your_ hints,\"\r\nhe had written earlier. \"A pupil of mine has a passion for public life,\r\nand having the means, is likely to get into Parliament. I said to him,\r\n'You are a fanatic, that cannot be helped, but you must try to be a\r\n\"rational fanatic.\"'\" Each of the friends thought very highly of the\r\npowers and services of the other. \"There is nothing you might not\r\naccomplish,\" he says to her. He turns off what she must have said of him\r\nwith playful deprecation: \"About Elijah--you must mean the Honble.\r\nElijah Pogram. There is no other Elijah to whom I bear the least\r\nresemblance.\" And each valued the friendship as a means of enabling them\r\nboth to serve God more truly. \"The spirit of the twenty-third Psalm and\r\nthe spirit of the ninetieth Psalm should be united in our lives.\"\r\n\r\nHer friendship with Mr. Jowett was, I cannot doubt, Miss Nightingale's\r\ngreatest consolation in these strenuous years. She was immersed in\r\nofficial drudgery, never forgetful, it is true, of the end in the means,\r\nbut sorely vexed and harassed by the difficulties and disappointments of\r\ncircumstance. Her friend's letters and conversation raised her above the\r\nconflict into a purer and calmer atmosphere. Not indeed that Mr. Jowett\r\nwas a quietist; she would little have respected him had he been so; but\r\nthough in the world, he was not of it; he was unsoiled by the dust of\r\nthe great road. She had, it is true, other and yet more unworldly\r\nfriends--nuns in convents and matrons or nurses in hospitals. With them,\r\ntoo, she exchanged intimate confidences in spiritual matters; but their\r\nstandpoint was not hers, and the exchange could only be with mental\r\nreservations on her part. To Mr. Jowett she was able to open\r\nunreservedly her truest thoughts. And then, too, the dearest of her\r\nother friends paid her an almost adoring worship, whilst some who were\r\nestranged offered only unsympathetic criticism. It was from Mr. Jowett\r\nalone that she heard the language of affectionate and understanding\r\nremonstrance. She heard it gladly, because she knew that it was\r\nsympathetic, and because she felt that her friend's character was\r\nattuned to her own highest ideals.\r\n\r\nThirty years after the date at which we have now arrived (1866), Miss\r\nNightingale read through the hundreds of letters she had received and\r\nkept from Mr. Jowett. She made copious extracts from them in pencil, and\r\nsent several to his biographers. Many of his letters to her were\r\nincluded in his _Life_, though the name of the recipient was not\r\ndisclosed. She was jealous in her life-time of the privacy of her life.\r\nShe rebuked Mr. Jowett once for accepting a copy of her cousin's\r\nstatuette of her. He explained that he had placed it where it would not\r\nbe observed. \"I consider you,\" he had already written, \"a sort of Royal\r\npersonage, not to be gossiped about with any one.\" The letters to her,\r\nhitherto published, were selected to throw light upon his views. In this\r\nMemoir, in which it has been decided to give (if it may be) a truthful\r\npicture of her life and character, I select rather those letters which\r\nshow the influence of his character upon hers. The following was noted\r\nby Miss Nightingale as \"one of the most beautiful, if not the most\r\nbeautiful, of the whole collection\":--\r\n\r\n     ASKRIGG, _July_ [1864]. I am afraid that hard-working persons are\r\n     very bad correspondents, at least I know that I am, or I should\r\n     have written to you long ago, which I have always a pleasure in\r\n     doing. But Plato, who is either my greatest friend or my greatest\r\n     enemy, and has finally swelled into three large volumes (you will\r\n     observe that I am proud of the size of my baby), is to blame for\r\n     preventing me. This place, at which I shall be staying for about\r\n     five weeks longer, is at the head of Wensleydale, high among\r\n     mountains in a most beautiful country, and what, I think, adds\r\n     greatly to the charm of the country, very pleasing for the\r\n     simplicity and intelligence of the people. Among the enjoyments\r\n     which I have here, which notwithstanding Plato are really very\r\n     great, I cannot help remembering you at 115 Park Street. I wish you\r\n     would venture to see something more of the sights and sounds of\r\n     nature. You will never persuade me that your way of life is\r\n     altogether the best for health any more than I could persuade you\r\n     into Mr. Gladstone's doctrine of the salubrity of living over a\r\n     churchyard.\r\n\r\n     As to the rest, I have no doubt that you could not be better than\r\n     you are. I don't wish to exaggerate (for you are the last person to\r\n     whom I should think of offering compliments), but I certainly\r\n     believe that it has been a great national good that you have taken\r\n     up the whole question of the sanitary condition of the soldier and\r\n     not confined yourself to hospitals. The difficulties and\r\n     stupidities would have been as great in the case of the hospitals,\r\n     and the object really far inferior in importance. Besides you could\r\n     never have gained the influence over medical men with their\r\n     professional jealousies that you have had over the War Office and\r\n     the Indian Government. Also, if your life is spared a few years\r\n     longer, a great deal more may be done. There are many resources\r\n     that are not yet exhausted. Therefore never listen to the voice\r\n     that tells you in a moment of weariness or pain that you ought to\r\n     have adhered to your old vocation.\r\n\r\n     I suppose there have been persons who have had so strong _a sense\r\n     of the identity of their own action with the will of God as to\r\n     exclude every other feeling, who have never wished to live nor\r\n     wished to die except as they fulfil his will_? Can we acquire this?\r\n     I don't know. But _such a sense of things would no doubt give\r\n     infinite rest and almost infinite power_. Perhaps quietists have\r\n     been most successful in gaining this sort of feeling, but the\r\n     quietists are not the people who have passed all their lives\r\n     rubbing and fighting against the world. But _I don't see why active\r\n     life might not become a sort of passive life too, passive in the\r\n     hands of God and in the fulfilment of the laws of nature. I\r\n     sometimes fancy that there are possibilities of human character\r\n     much greater than have been realized_, mysteries, as they may be\r\n     called, of character and manner and style which remain to be called\r\n     forth and explained. One great field for thought on this subject is\r\n     the manner in which character may grow and change quite late in\r\n     life.... [The rest of the letter is about the politics of the day.]\r\n\r\nThe passages which I have printed in italics are those which Miss\r\nNightingale had specially marked. \"Can we help one another,\" he wrote in\r\nthe following year (March 5, 1865), \"to make life a higher and nobler\r\nsort of thing--more of a calm and peaceful and never-ending service of\r\nGod? Perhaps--a little.\" The marked passages show in what way Miss\r\nNightingale found in Mr. Jowett's friendship a source of comfort, and a\r\nfresh inspiration towards her own spiritual ideals. In her meditations\r\nof later years, a greater \"passivity in action\" was the state of\r\nperfection which she constantly sought to attain.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Jowett, as will have been noted, sought to reassure her about her\r\nconcentration for the most part upon work for the Army and for India.\r\nAnd indeed she was herself intensely devoted to it, nor was it ever\r\ndeposed from a principal place in her thoughts and interests. Yet there\r\nwere times, as shown in a letter already quoted (p. 82), when she felt\r\nthat this work, insistently though it appealed to her, though it was\r\nbound up with some of her fondest memories, was all the while, if not a\r\nkind of desertion, yet at best only a temporary call. Her first \"call\r\nfrom God\" had been to service in another sort, and she was anxious to\r\nmake peace with \"those first affections.\" In January 1864 she sent these\r\ninstructions to Mrs. Bracebridge, who directed that if Miss Nightingale\r\nshould survive her they were to be handed on to Mrs. Sutherland:--\r\n\r\n     You know that I always believed it to be God's will for me that I\r\n     should live and die in Hospitals. When this call He has made upon\r\n     me for other work stops, and I am no longer able to work, I should\r\n     wish to be taken to St. Thomas's Hospital and to be placed _in a\r\n     general ward_ (which is what I should have desired had I come to my\r\n     end as a Hospital matron). And I beg you to be so very good as to\r\n     see that this my wish is accomplished, whenever the time comes, if\r\n     you will take the trouble as a true friend, which you always have\r\n     been, are, and will be. And this will make me die in peace because\r\n     I believe it to be God's will.\r\n\r\nIt was not so to be. But we shall find, on opening the next Part in the\r\nstory of Miss Nightingale's long life, that she was presently to have\r\ntime for helping forward the movement, which she had promoted as a\r\nReformer of Hospitals and as the Founder of Modern Nursing, into a new\r\nand a wider field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                                NEW MASTERS\r\n\r\n                                  (1866)\r\n\r\n\r\n              Among new men, strange faces, other minds.\r\n                                                   TENNYSON.\r\n\r\nThe year 1866 was one of stirring events both at home and abroad. It saw\r\nthe downfall of the Whig Administration which, with a brief interval\r\n(1858-59), had held office under different chiefs since December 1852.\r\nIn March Mr. Gladstone, now leader of the House of Commons, introduced a\r\nReform Bill, of which the fortunes were uncertain owing to the dissent\r\nof the Adullamites under Mr. Lowe. On April 27 the second reading was\r\ncarried by a majority of five only. On June 18 the Government was\r\ndefeated in Committee on Lord Dunkellin's amendment, and resigned. On\r\nthe day before Lord Russell's Government was defeated war was declared\r\nbetween Austria and her allies on the one side, and Prussia and Italy on\r\nthe other. Prussia, armed with her new breech-loading gun, quickly\r\ndefeated Austria. The foundation of the future German Empire under the\r\nhegemony of Prussia was laid, and Italy, as part of the price of a\r\nvictory not hers, received from Austria the province of Venetia. Of\r\nthese great events, some brought consequences with them to causes in\r\nwhich Miss Nightingale was deeply interested, whilst others made direct\r\ndemands on her exertions.\r\n\r\nThe earlier months of the year were thus a period of continuous and\r\nalmost feverish activity on her part. Two of her letters--the former\r\nwritten when the fate of the Government was still trembling in the\r\nbalance, the latter written when the new Government had been installed\r\nand when the war was raging on the continent--will serve to introduce\r\nthe subjects of this chapter:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Harriet Martineau._) 35 SOUTH STREET, _May_ 2\r\n     [1866].... We have been rather in a fever lately because Ministers\r\n     were hovering between in and out. Mr. Villiers promised us a Bill\r\n     quite early in the year for a London uniform Poor Rate for the\r\n     _sick_ and consolidated hospitals under a central management. (This\r\n     was before we got our Earls and Archbishops and M.P.'s together to\r\n     storm him in his den.) We shall not get our Bill this session, for\r\n     Mr. Villiers is afraid of losing the Government one vote. But we\r\n     shall certainly get it in time. \"In 1860 the consolations of the\r\n     future never failed me for a moment. And I find them now an equally\r\n     secure resource.\" Can you guess who wrote those words? They are in\r\n     a note from Mr. Gladstone written the morning of his speech on the\r\n     Franchise Bill. Could you have believed he was so much in earnest?\r\n     I could not. And yet I knew him once very well. His speech (he was\r\n     ill) impressed the House very much. \"And e'en the ranks of Tuscany\r\n     could scarce forbear to cheer.\" ...\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Julius Mohl._) 35 SOUTH STREET, _July_ 12\r\n     [1866]. I have been in the thick of all these changes of\r\n     Government. I should like, if you had been in England, to have\r\n     shown you the notes I have had from those going out, and those\r\n     coming in--especially from my own peculiar masters, Lord de Grey\r\n     and Lord Stanley. They are so much more serious and anxious than\r\n     the world gives them credit for. I used to think public opinion was\r\n     higher than private opinion. I now think just the reverse. As for\r\n     the _Times_ and about all these German affairs--I believe the\r\n     _Times_ to be a faithful reflection of the public opinion of our\r\n     upper classes: see what it is. Last week Prussia and Bismarck were\r\n     the greatest criminals in Europe. This week the needle-gun (I mean\r\n     Prussia and Bismarck--no, I mean the needle-gun) is a\r\n     constitutional Protestant--or a Protestant constitution, I am not\r\n     sure which.... But I was going to tell you: Lord Stanley has taken\r\n     the Foreign Office (how he or anybody could take willingly the\r\n     Foreign Office, England having now so little weight in European\r\n     councils, in preference to the India Office which Lord Stanley\r\n     created[67] and where we _create_ the future of 150 millions of\r\n     men, one can't understand). Lord Stanley accepted the Foreign\r\n     Office solely because he could not help it--Lord Clarendon (which\r\n     I saw under his own hand) having \"unhesitatingly declined\" it,\r\n     although Lord Derby made the most vehement love to him, even to\r\n     offering to him the nomination of half the places in the Cabinet.\r\n     This I heard from Lord Clarendon himself.... Like you, I can't\r\n     sleep or eat for thinking of this War. I can't distract my thoughts\r\n     from it--because, you know, it is my business. I am consulted on\r\n     both sides as to their Hospital and sanitary arrangements.... And\r\n     then those stupid Italians publish parts of my letter--just the\r\n     froth at the end, you know, while I had given them a solid pudding\r\n     of advice at their own request--publish it cruelly, without my\r\n     leave, with my address--since which my doors have been besieged by\r\n     all exiles of all nations asking to be sent to Italy, and women\r\n     threatening to \"_accoucher_\" (_sic_) in my passage. I sometimes\r\n     think I must give up business, _i.e._ work, or life. It would take\r\n     two strong policemen to keep my beggars in check. No one could\r\n     believe the stories I should have to tell--people who beg of me\r\n     whom I might just as well beg of ... [a sheet missing]. Of course\r\n     now I have to begin again at the very beginning with Mr. Gathorne\r\n     Hardy at the Poor Law Board, to get our Metropolitan Workhouse\r\n     Infirmary Bill. It was a cruel disappointment to me to see the Bill\r\n     go just as I had it in my grasp. Also: a Public Health Service\r\n     organization for Sir John Lawrence in India which I lost by 24\r\n     hours!! owing to Lord de Grey's going out. However, I am well nigh\r\n     done for. Life is too hard for me. I have suffered so very much all\r\n     the winter and spring, for which nothing did me any good but a\r\n     curious new-fangled little operation of putting opium in under the\r\n     skin, which relieves one for 24 hours, but does not improve the\r\n     vivacity or serenity of one's intellect. When Ministers went out, I\r\n     had hopes for a time from a Committee of the House of Commons (on\r\n     which serves John Stuart Mill) \"on the special local government of\r\n     the Metropolis.\" At their request I wrote them a long letter. Then\r\n     because it is July and they are rather hot, they give it up for\r\n     this year. The change of Ministers, which brings hard work to us\r\n     drudges, releases the House of Commons men. Alas! (There is a\r\n     pathetic story of Balzac's, in which a poor woman who had followed\r\n     the Russian campaign, was never able to articulate any word except\r\n     _Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!_ I am afraid of going mad like her and not\r\n     being able to articulate any word but _Alas! alas! alas!_)--F. N.\r\n\r\n  [67] Lord Stanley had been President of the Board of Control in 1858, in\r\n       which capacity he conducted the India Bill through the House of\r\n       Commons, and on its passage he became the first Secretary of State\r\n       for India.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nOf the events over which Miss Nightingale cried alas! in this letter,\r\nthe one which came first was the loss of Mr. Villiers's Poor Law Bill.\r\nThe loss, however, as she rightly surmised in writing to Miss Martineau,\r\nwas only temporary. The whole subject is connected with a distinct\r\nbranch of Miss Nightingale's work, of which a description must be\r\nreserved for the next chapter. She was in large measure, as we shall\r\nhear, the founder of Sick Nursing among the Indigent Poor, and a pioneer\r\nin Poor Law Reform.\r\n\r\nThe next event is connected with a subject with which we have already\r\nmade acquaintance. Miss Nightingale \"lost by 24 hours the opportunity of\r\norganizing a Public Health Service in India for Sir John Lawrence.\" The\r\nstory of this lost opportunity and its retrieval illustrate the truth of\r\nsomething said already;[68] namely, the difference it made that there\r\nwas in London, in the person of Miss Nightingale, a resolute enthusiast,\r\nto whom the question of Indian sanitation was not \"one of a thousand\r\nquestions,\" but the one question of absorbing interest. That the\r\nopportunity of which she spoke was lost, was not, as by this time the\r\nreader will hardly need to be told, in any way whatever the fault of\r\nMiss Nightingale. It is a curious story, and is the subject of a great\r\nmass of correspondence amongst her Papers--a mass eloquent of the eager\r\ninterest and infinite trouble which she devoted to the matter; but the\r\nstory itself admits of being told succinctly. A few words, however, are\r\nfirst necessary on the essential issues; it was not a case of much ado\r\nabout nothing. The whole future of sanitary progress in India was, or\r\nmight reasonably be thought to be, at stake. Under the energetic rule of\r\nSir John Lawrence, a good start had been made. The Governor-General\r\ncontinued to report progress to Miss Nightingale, and suggestions which\r\nshe sent were communicated by him to his officers. But the larger\r\nquestions of organization had still to be settled. Sir John's eagerness\r\nas a sanitary reformer was in some measure held in check by shortage of\r\nmoney. \"Sanitary works,\" as Lord Salisbury remarked at a later stage of\r\nthe affair, \"are uniformly costly works.\" Miss Nightingale's view was\r\nthat whether advance was to be slower or quicker, the organization\r\nshould be on lines which would ensure the importance of advance being\r\nconstantly kept in mind. She insisted that the Public Health Service in\r\nIndia should be a separate service, responsible to the Governor-General\r\nin Council, not a subordinate branch tucked away under some other\r\ndepartment. This is the burden of many letters and memoranda from her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n  [68] Above, p. 58.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1866 a double opportunity seemed to offer itself to Miss\r\nNightingale for advancing her cause. At the beginning of February Sir\r\nCharles Wood resigned office, and her friend, Lord de Grey, became\r\nSecretary of State for India in his place. At the same time she had\r\nreceived an important letter from the Governor-General (dated Calcutta,\r\nJan. 19). Her friend, Mr. Ellis, who had been in conclave (as we have\r\nheard) with her and her circle, had shortly before submitted proposals\r\nto him. Sir John Lawrence wrote to her: \"As regards the reconstruction\r\nof our sanitary organizations, we are sending home to the Secretary of\r\nState a copy of Mr. Ellis's note which he sent me, and are proposing a\r\nfurther change somewhat in accordance with his plan. I have no doubt\r\nthat you will see the dispatch, and therefore I had better not send it\r\nto you.\" He then went on to give a summary of its contents. The summary\r\nwas brief, and allowed of different opinions as to the ultimate bearing\r\nof the Governor-General's proposals. He had assumed as a matter of\r\ncourse that she would be shown his dispatch, and she applied to her\r\nofficial friends for a sight of it. They would be delighted if they had\r\nit, but they had received no such dispatch; perhaps it would come by the\r\nnext mail. But it did not, nor by the next, nor the next, for a very\r\nsimple reason, as will presently appear. Miss Nightingale put on her\r\nfriend Mr. Ellis, who as the head of a Presidency Health Commission had\r\na direct _locus standi_, to inquire and even to search at the India\r\nOffice. \"They swear by their gods,\" he reported, \"that they have no such\r\ndispatch.\" Miss Nightingale was becoming desperate. She was perfectly\r\ncertain that Sir John Lawrence must have sent it. Meanwhile the Home\r\nGovernment was tottering to its fall; the new Secretary of State might\r\nbe one who knew not Miss Nightingale. She entreated that a further\r\nsearch should be made. On May 5 she was told that \"at last the Sanitary\r\nMinute had been found, and a copy of it was sent for her consideration.\r\nIt had been attached to some papers connected with the Financial\r\nDepartment and thus had escaped attention. Lord de Grey begged Miss\r\nNightingale to let him have the benefit of her opinion upon it as soon\r\nas possible.\" She afterwards learnt that it was the Secretary of State\r\nhimself who, with his own hands, had searched for and found the\r\nGovernor-General's Minute. It had \"escaped attention\" for nearly four\r\nmonths. The incident did not raise Miss Nightingale's opinion of\r\ngovernment offices, or lessen her sense of responsibility in the duty of\r\nkeeping the sanitary question to the fore. She was ill when the\r\nMinister's message arrived; but she at once set to work, and on May 7\r\nshe sent in a memorandum giving a summary of her views, and pointing out\r\nwherein the Governor-General's proposals seemed to require revision if\r\nthe recommendations of the Royal Commission were to be carried out\r\neffectually. The Minister was busy with many things. His own fate and\r\nthat of his colleagues were in peril every day. A month intervened\r\nbefore the next move was taken. On June 11 Miss Nightingale was asked by\r\nLord de Grey, through Captain Galton, to develop her views further and\r\nto draw up, in consultation with Dr. Sutherland, \"a draft letter which\r\nhe could submit to the Indian Council as his reply to Sir John\r\nLawrence.\" The letter was to take the form either of \"a practical scheme\r\nto propose to Sir John Lawrence for the sanitary administration of\r\nIndia\" or of \"such a description of the requirements as would draw from\r\nSir J. L. a practical scheme.\" It was suggested that perhaps it would be\r\nbest if the letter (1) shadowed out the requirements and (2) sketched a\r\nscheme of administration for carrying them out. This was a large order\r\nand took time. On June 19 Miss Nightingale sent in her draft. She was\r\n\"24 hours\" too late, for on June 18 the Government had been defeated.\r\nThere was, however, a short period of grace owing to the absence of the\r\nQueen at Balmoral and to her unwillingness to accept Lord Russell's\r\nresignation.[69] Lord de Grey had no time to pass the letter through the\r\nSecretary of State's Council, but he did what he could. He left on\r\nrecord at the India Office, he told Miss Nightingale, a Minute[70]\r\nclosely following the lines of her Memorandum. If his successor let the\r\nmatter go to sleep again, Lord de Grey would be ready to call attention\r\nto it in Parliament. He assured Miss Nightingale that his interest in\r\nsuch questions would remain as warm as ever, and as she was now more\r\nlikely than he to know what was going on, he begged her to keep him\r\ninformed.\r\n\r\n  [69] In one of Mr. Jowett's letters to Miss Nightingale (June 1866)\r\n       there is this story of Lord Russell. \"On the evening of the crisis\r\n       he was not to be found. He had gone down to Richmond to hear the\r\n       Nightingales (your cousins)! 'And the provoking thing,' as he wrote\r\n       to a friend, 'was that they did not sing that night.'\"\r\n\r\n  [70] The substance of it may be found at p. 11 of the _Memorandum_ (as\r\n       cited above, p. 34 _n._).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nSo, then, she had been too late. \"I am furious to that degree,\" she\r\nwrote to Captain Galton (June 23), \"at having lost Lord de Grey's five\r\nmonths at the India Office that I am fit to blow you all to pieces with\r\nan infernal machine of my own invention.\" She threw some of the blame\r\nupon Dr. Sutherland, whose mission to the Mediterranean she had not been\r\nable to cancel, and who, for weeks at a time during this year, was\r\nabsent at Malta and Gibraltar or in Algiers. Algiers, indeed, she wrote\r\ntauntingly, \"why not Astley's?\" That would be quite as good a change for\r\nhim. Sometimes she varied the figure, and Dr. Sutherland and his party\r\nfigured in her letters as Wombwell's Menagerie. \"The Menagerie, I hear,\"\r\nshe wrote (Jan. 26), \"including three ladies, H.M. Commissioners, and\r\ntwo ladies' maids, has gone after a column in the interior.\" Had he\r\nstayed at home, he might have been able to find the missing dispatch;\r\nand in any case they could have written at leisure, from the hints in\r\nSir John Lawrence's letter to her, the Memorandum which they ultimately\r\nhad to write in haste. The truant seems to have foreseen what a rod in\r\npickle was awaiting him on his return. \"I have been thinking,\" he wrote\r\nto her from Algiers (Jan. 28), \"Will she be glad to hear from me? or\r\nWill she swear? I don't know, but nevertheless I will tell her a bit of\r\nmy mind about our visit to Astley's.\" And he goes on to write an\r\nadmirable account of his experiences, in which he ingeniously emphasizes\r\nthe vast importance of his inquiries in connection with their Indian\r\nwork. Nor was this only an excuse; Dr. Sutherland's Report on Algeria,\r\nand the French sanitary service there, was a most valuable piece of\r\nwork. It is impossible to read his writings--whether in published\r\nreports or in his manuscripts among Miss Nightingale's papers--without\r\nperceiving how well based was the reliance which she placed upon his\r\ncollaboration. His wife stayed at home and saw much of Miss Nightingale.\r\nMrs. Sutherland must have reported the state of things in South Street;\r\nfor a month later Dr. Sutherland wrote thus to Miss Nightingale (Feb.\r\n20): \"The mail which ought to have arrived yesterday came in to-day, and\r\nI am trying to save the out mail, which leaves the harbour at 12,\r\nwithout much prospect of success. I have had a letter to-day from home\r\nabout you, and if it had come yesterday, Ellis and I would certainly\r\nhave been embarking to-day for England. After the account of your\r\nsuffering, and of the pressure of business under which you are sinking,\r\nI feel wild to get away from this. To-night we leave Algeria, and by the\r\ntime you get this we will be on our way home. God bless you and keep you\r\nto us. Amen.\" Well, I can only hope that Dr. Sutherland enjoyed\r\nhis trip while it lasted; for I fear that he may have had a bad\r\nquarter-of-an-hour when he reported himself at South Street on his\r\nreturn. She had complained of his absence to another of her close\r\nallies, Dr. Farr. \"I have all Dr. Sutherland's business to do,\" she\r\nwrote (Jan. 19), \"besides my own. If it could be done, I should not\r\nmind. I had just as soon wear out in two months as in two years, so the\r\nwork be done. But it can't. It is just like two men going into business\r\nwith a million each. The one suddenly withdraws. The other may wear\r\nhimself to the bone, but he can't meet the engagements with one million\r\nwhich he made with two. Add to this, I have been so ill since the\r\nbeginning of the year as to be often unable to have my position moved\r\nfrom pain for 48 hours at a time. But to business....\"\r\n\r\nOne good stroke of business, however, Miss Nightingale had been able to\r\ndo during Dr. Sutherland's absence. She reported it to Dr. Farr: \"The\r\ncompensation to my disturbed state of mind has been a convert to the\r\nsanitary cause I have made for Madras--no less a person than Lord\r\nNapier. I managed to scramble up to see him before he sailed.\" The\r\n\"conversion\" means not necessarily that Lord Napier needed to find\r\nsalvation, but refers rather to the fact that his predecessor in the\r\ngovernorship of Madras had been unsympathetic. Lord Napier, on receiving\r\nthe appointment, had expressed a desire to learn Miss Nightingale's\r\nviews. He had been secretary to the British Embassy at Constantinople\r\nduring the Crimean War, and had there formed a high opinion of her\r\nability and devotion. She now wrote to him about Indian sanitary reform,\r\nand he at once replied:--\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Napier to Miss Nightingale._) 24 PRINCES GATE, _Feb._ 16\r\n     [1866]. I beg you to believe that I am far from being impatient of\r\n     your communication or indifferent to your wishes. I have read your\r\n     letter with great interest, and I regret that you had not time and\r\n     strength to make it longer. You will confer a great favour on me by\r\n     sending me the 8vo volume of which you speak, and I would not\r\n     stumble at the two folio blue books.... The Sanitary question like\r\n     the railway question or the irrigation question will probably\r\n     remain subordinated in some degree to financial requirements, to\r\n     the necessity of shewing a surplus at the end of the year; but\r\n     within the limits of my available resources I promise you a zealous\r\n     intervention on behalf of the cause you have so much at heart. You\r\n     say that you do not know me well; but you cannot deprive me of the\r\n     happiness and honor of having seen you at the greatest moment of\r\n     your life in the little parlour of the hospital at Scutari. I was a\r\n     spectator, and I would have been a fellow-labourer if any one would\r\n     have employed my services. I remain at your orders for any day and\r\n     hour.--Very sincerely yours, NAPIER.\r\n\r\nTheir interview took place three days later. Lord Napier, during his\r\ngovernorship of Madras, which lasted six years, tried hard to fulfil his\r\npromise. To other matters he attended also; but it was to questions\r\nconnected with the public health that he devoted his most particular\r\nattention, and throughout his residence in India he kept up a\r\ncorrespondence with Miss Nightingale about them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nMeanwhile on the immediate question of the moment she had been too late,\r\nand her political friends were out. She was a Whig and a keen Reformer;\r\nbut she was a sanitarian before she was a politician, and as soon as the\r\nWhigs fell she was on the alert to make friends for her causes with the\r\nmammon of unrighteousness. She was eager to hear the earliest political\r\nnews:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Captain Galton._) _June_ 27.... Now do write\r\n     to a wretched female, F. N., about _who_ is to come in _where_.\r\n     Does Gen. Peel come to the War Office? If so, will he annihilate\r\n     our Civil Sanitary element? Is Sutherland to go all the same to\r\n     Malta and Gibraltar this autumn? Will Gen. Peel imperil the Army\r\n     Sanitary Commission? I _must_ know: ye Infernal Powers! Is Mr. Lowe\r\n     to come in to the India Office? It is all unmitigated disaster to\r\n     me. For, as Lord Stanley is to be Foreign Office (the only place\r\n     where he can be of _no_ use to us), I shall not have a friend in\r\n     the world. If I were to say more, I should fall to swearing, I am\r\n     so indignant.--Ever yours furiously, F. N.\r\n\r\nCaptain Galton replied that he had it from Mr. Lowe himself that he\r\nwould not join the Tories; that of the actual appointments he had not as\r\nyet heard; but that as the Secretary of State's was an impersonal\r\noffice, Dr. Sutherland's commission to visit the Mediterranean would\r\nstill hold good--or bad. \"You say the S. of S. is an impersonal\r\ncreature,\" replied Miss Nightingale (July 3); \"I wish he wuz!\" When the\r\nnames of the new Ministers were announced, Captain Galton threw out a\r\nsuggestion tentatively that Lord Cranborne[71] (India Office) might be\r\napproachable through Lady Cranborne. \"I have a much better\r\nrecommendation to him than that,\" wrote Miss Nightingale in some triumph\r\n(July 7), \"and have already been put into 'direct communication' with\r\nhim, _not_ at my own request.\" The letters tell the story of her\r\nintroduction to new masters at the India Office and the Poor Law\r\nBoard:--\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Stanley to Miss Nightingale._) ST. JAMES'S SQUARE, _July_ 6.\r\n     I shall see Lord Cranborne to-day (we go down to be sworn in) and\r\n     will tell him the whole sanitary story, and also say that I have\r\n     advised you to write to him as you have always done to me to my\r\n     great advantage. You will find him shrewd, industrious, and a good\r\n     man of business.\r\n\r\n  [71] Better known as the Marquis of Salisbury, to which title he\r\n       succeeded in 1868.\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Lord Cranborne._) 35 SOUTH STREET, _July_ 17.\r\n     Lord Stanley had the kindness to advise me to write to you, and to\r\n     tell _me_ that he would tell _you_ that he had \"advised\" me \"to\r\n     write to\" you as I \"have done to\" him. This is my only excuse for\r\n     what would otherwise be a very great impertinence and what I fear\r\n     may seem to you such even now, viz. my present application to you\r\n     on the India Public Health question. I know I ought to begin, \"Miss\r\n     Nightingale presents her compliments to Lord Cranborne.\" But the\r\n     \"third person\" always becomes confused. Lord Stanley has probably\r\n     scarcely had the time to tell you my long story. I fear, therefore,\r\n     I must introduce myself, by saying that my apology for what you may\r\n     (justly) consider an unwarrantable interference must be--the part I\r\n     have taken in the Public Health of the Army in India for the last 8\r\n     years, having been in communication with Lord Stanley, Sir C. Wood,\r\n     and Lord de Grey about it, and being now in constant communication\r\n     with Sir John Lawrence and others in India on the same subject.\r\n     When Lord de Grey left office, Lord Stanley, of his own accord,\r\n     kindly asked whether he should \"put\" me \"in direct communication\"\r\n     with you.\r\n\r\n     This is my general apology. My particular one is: that by last mail\r\n     I received some very pressing letters from India on the subject of\r\n     the introduction of an efficient Public Health administration into\r\n     India, which is after this wise:--the spirit of the very general\r\n     recommendations made by the R. Commission which reported in 1863\r\n     (presided over by Lord Stanley) had never been completely acted up\r\n     to--there have been difficulties and clashings in consequence. A\r\n     Minute (of January 9, 1866) was sent home by Sir John Lawrence\r\n     proposing to connect the Public Health Service with the\r\n     Inspectorship of Prisons. The proposal appears to have been made\r\n     without due consideration of the importance and greatness of the\r\n     duties; if it were carried out, it would put an end, we believe, to\r\n     any prospect of efficient progress. (I think I am correct in saying\r\n     that Lord Stanley concurs in this view.) Lord de Grey was deeply\r\n     impressed with this defect in the scheme; he drew up a Minute (just\r\n     before he left office) in order to leave his views on record for\r\n     you, setting forth generally the duties, and asking for a\r\n     reconsideration of the subject in India, before the\r\n     organisation was finally decided on--of the Public Health Service. I\r\n     would now venture to ask your favourable consideration for this\r\n     proposal, because, on the organisation of a service adequate for the\r\n     object, depends the entire future of the Public Health in India.\r\n     We commit ourselves into your hands.\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Cranborne to Miss Nightingale._) INDIA OFFICE, _July 17_. I\r\n     am much obliged to you for your letter; and especially for your\r\n     kindness in relieving me from the literary effort of composing a\r\n     letter or series of letters in the third person. Lord Stanley spoke\r\n     to me about the sanitary question some days ago, and told me I\r\n     should probably hear from you. I have made enquiries as to the\r\n     Despatch you mention, and find that it is in the office still\r\n     awaiting decision. No confirmation of it shall take place until I\r\n     have communicated further with you upon the subject. I shall not be\r\n     able to go into the sanitary question until I have disposed of the\r\n     claims of the Indian officers, which, according to all the best\r\n     authorities, are very urgently in need of immediate settlement. But\r\n     as soon as that is done with, I hope that the sanitary question may\r\n     be taken up without delay.\r\n\r\n     (_Mr. Gathorne Hardy to Miss Nightingale._) POOR LAW BOARD, _July_\r\n     25. You owe me no apology for calling my attention to material\r\n     points connected with the subject in the consideration of which you\r\n     are so much engaged. I should say this to any one who wrote in the\r\n     same spirit as yourself, but I am really indebted to you who have\r\n     earned no common title to advise and suggest upon anything which\r\n     affects the treatment of the sick. Your note arrived at the very\r\n     instant when a gentleman was urging me to lay before you questions\r\n     relating to Workhouse Infirmaries, and I should not have hesitated\r\n     to do so if needful even without the cordial invitation which you\r\n     give me to ask your assistance. At present I have not advanced very\r\n     far from want of time, as while Parliament is sitting I am\r\n     necessarily very much occupied with other business, and I am\r\n     anxious to remedy, if possible, present and urgent grievances\r\n     before I enter thoroughly upon legislation for the future. I shall\r\n     bear in mind the offer which you have made and in all probability\r\n     avail myself of it to the full.\r\n\r\nSo, then, perhaps Miss Nightingale would not be left wholly friendless\r\nafter all. She was to have new masters. Would they, or would they not,\r\naccept her service? We shall hear in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Miss Nightingale had been very busily engaged with the\r\ncorrespondence and other tasks thrown upon her by the outbreak of war in\r\nEurope. \"Saw Florence for half an hour this morning,\" reported her\r\nfather (June); \"over-fatigued certainly, but speaking with a voice only\r\ntoo loud and strong. Princess [Alice of] Hesse writes to her to ask for\r\ninstructions for the hospitals there, and Sutherland's joke is 'There's\r\nnothing left for _you_, all is gone to Garibaldi.'\" She had been applied\r\nto by representatives of all three combatants. Prussia, as usual, was\r\nthe better prepared, and the Crown Princess had written to Miss\r\nNightingale in March (three months before hostilities actually began)\r\nasking for her assistance and advice about hospital and nursing\r\narrangements. A Prussian manufacturer communicated with her about the\r\nbest form of hospital tents for field-service. The two sisters of the\r\nBritish Royal House were on opposite sides in this war, for\r\nHesse-Darmstadt had thrown in its lot with Austria; but it was not till\r\nafter the outbreak of hostilities that the Princess Alice wrote to Miss\r\nNightingale through Lady Ely[72] for advice about war hospitals. Miss\r\nNightingale at once sent it. Her Memorandum, she was told (July 3), had\r\nbeen forwarded to Prince Louis for use at Headquarters, and the Princess\r\nbegged her to send further information for use by the hospital\r\nauthorities in Darmstadt. The Italians had been earlier in \"going to\r\nMiss Nightingale.\" The Secretary of the \"Florence Committee for helping\r\nthe Sick and Wounded\" had written to her for advice in May. Her reply\r\ncaused great delight, as an English correspondent at Florence recorded.\r\n\"I have read the letter,\" he wrote, \"which will be translated and\r\ninserted in the _Nazione_. Miss Nightingale gives, with her accustomed\r\nclearness and precision, excellent advice to the Committee, which some\r\nof them very much need. At the same time she expresses her cordial\r\nsympathy with the Italian cause. She recalls the admirable condition in\r\nwhich the Sardinian army was landed in the Crimea, and the praise which\r\nits appearance extorted from Lord Clyde. And she concludes her letter by\r\nsaying that if the sacrifice of her poor life would hasten their cause\r\nby one half-hour, she would gladly give it them. But she is a miserable\r\ninvalid.\"[73] The Committee had asked whether she would not come to\r\nItaly \"were it but for one day\" in order to inspire them by her\r\npresence. Her piece of \"froth\" (as she called it) was widely printed in\r\nthe Italian press. She had deplored the outbreak of the war, but when it\r\nresulted in an extension of the boundaries of free Italy she felt that\r\nthere were compensations. Miss Nightingale also joined the Committee of\r\nthe \"Ladies' Association\" formed in this country \"for the Relief of the\r\nSick and Wounded of all nations engaged.\" She advised the Committee on\r\nthe form of aid most requisite, and at the end of the war, in thanking\r\nthe Crown Princess of Prussia for a letter, she gave Her Royal Highness\r\nan account of what had been done by the English Committee. The\r\ncorrespondence with the Princess was long, and it formed a new tie\r\nbetween Miss Nightingale and Mr. Jowett, who was a great favourite with\r\nthe Crown Princess and who entertained a very high opinion of her\r\nabilities. The answering letter from the Princess covers eighteen pages,\r\ncontaining (as Dr. Sutherland said of it) \"just the kind of practical\r\ninformation which a person who has had experience in these matters\r\ndesires to obtain.\" A characteristic extract or two from the\r\ncorrespondence on each side must here suffice:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to the Crown Princess of Prussia._) 35 SOUTH\r\n     STREET, _Sept._ 22 [1866].... I think your Royal Highness may be\r\n     pleased to hear even the humble opinion of an old campaigner like\r\n     myself about how well the Army Hospital Service was managed in the\r\n     late terrible war. Information reached me through my old friends and\r\n     trainers of Kaiserswerth. The Knights of St. John of Jerusalem took\r\n     charge of all the Deaconesses and all the offers of houses and rooms\r\n     made to them. The system seems to me to have been admirably\r\n     managed--especially the sending away the wounded in hundreds to\r\n     towns where rooms and houses and nursing were offered. The\r\n     overcrowding and massing together of large numbers of wounded is\r\n     always more disastrous than battle itself. From many different\r\n     quarters I have heard of the great devotion, skill and generous\r\n     kindness of the Prussian surgeons--to all sides alike.... On this,\r\n     the day of Manin's death nine years ago, the exiled Dictator of\r\n     Venice and one of the purest and most far-seeing of statesmen, who\r\n     fought so good a battle for the freedom of Venice, but who did not\r\n     live to see its accomplishment, I cannot but congratulate your\r\n     Royal Highness, at the risk of impertinence, at seeing the\r\n     fulfilment of that liberation brought about by Prussian arms.\r\n\r\n  [72] Lady Ely as lady-in-waiting on Queen Victoria had made Miss\r\n       Nightingale's acquaintance at Balmoral in 1856.\r\n\r\n  [73] _Daily Telegraph_ (foreign intelligence), June 12, 1866.\r\n\r\n     (_The Crown Princess of Prussia to Miss Nightingale._) NEW PALACE,\r\n     POTSDAM, _Sept._ 29. I was delighted to receive your long and\r\n     interesting letter yesterday, and hasten to express my warmest thanks\r\n     for it. Every appreciation of Prussia in England can but give me the\r\n     greatest pleasure.... As you are such an advocate for fresh air, I\r\n     cannot refrain from telling you what I have myself _seen_ in\r\n     confirmation of your opinion on the subject, and what I am sure would\r\n     interest dear Sir James Clark, who is your great ally on this point.\r\n     In a small well-kept Hospital, where wounded soldiers had been taken\r\n     care of for some time, the wounds in several cases did not seem to\r\n     improve, the general state of health of the patients did not show\r\n     any progress. They were feverish, and the appearance of the wounds\r\n     was that of the beginning of mortification. In the garden of the\r\n     Hospital there was a shed or summer-house of rough boards, with a\r\n     wooden roof; the little building was quite open in front and on the\r\n     other sides closed up with boards but with an aperture of two feet\r\n     all the way under the roof--so that it was like being out of doors.\r\n     Six patients were moved down into this shed (sorely against their\r\n     will, they were afraid of catching cold). The very next day they\r\n     got better; the fever left them, the condition of the wounds became\r\n     healthy; they enjoyed their summer-house--in spite of two violent\r\n     storms which knocked down the tables; and all quickly recovered! I\r\n     had seen them every day upstairs and saw them every day in the\r\n     garden; the difference was incredible.... The Crown Prince wishes\r\n     me to say what pleasure it gives him to hear you speak in praise of\r\n     our Prussian army surgeons.... I remain ever, dear Miss\r\n     Nightingale, yours sincerely, PRINCESS ROYAL.\r\n\r\nAmong other details, a particular kind of field-ambulance was mentioned\r\nby the Crown Princess as having proved very useful. Miss Nightingale at\r\nonce put Dr. Longmore, of our own hospital service, in possession of the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nIt will have been seen that Miss Nightingale's experience was much\r\nrequisitioned in the War of 1866; but the organization of war-nursing\r\nunder the Red Cross had not then attained full development owing to the\r\nfact that the Austrian Government had not ratified the Geneva Convention\r\nof 1864. In 1867 a gold medal was awarded to Miss Nightingale by the\r\nConference of Red Cross Societies at Paris. In 1870 (March 31) the\r\nAustrian Patriotic Society for the Relief of Wounded Soldiers elected\r\nher an Honorary Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nThe year 1866 was, then, one of great activity with Miss Nightingale;\r\nbut by the middle of August her work was not at such high pressure as in\r\nthe preceding months. Parliament was up, and the new Ministers, with\r\nwhom she had established friendly relations, were turning round. At this\r\ntime a home call came to Miss Nightingale. Her mother was reported to be\r\nailing. She was disinclined to make the usual move with her husband from\r\nHampshire to Derbyshire; so, while the father went to Lea Hurst, Miss\r\nNightingale decided to stay with her mother at Embley. It was an event\r\nin the family circle, for Florence had not been to either of the homes\r\nfor ten years. There was much correspondence and many preparations.\r\nFather and mother were equally delighted, and the journey in an invalid\r\ncarriage did the daughter no serious harm. She stayed at Embley from the\r\nmiddle of August till the end of November. It was the first holiday she\r\nhad taken, for ten years also; but it was not much of a holiday either.\r\nShe set to work on the health of Romsey, the nearest town, and of\r\nWinchester, the county town. She wrote up to her friend Dr. Farr at the\r\nRegistrar-General's Office for the mortality tables, found the figures\r\nfor those towns above the average, and bade the citizens look to their\r\ndrains. Then she commanded Dr. Sutherland to Embley for the transaction\r\nof business in view of next year's session. She found her mother happy\r\nand cheerful. \"I don't think my dear mother was ever more touching or\r\ninteresting to me,\" she wrote to Madame Mohl (Aug. 21), \"than she is now\r\nin her state of dilapidation. She is so much gentler, calmer, more\r\nthoughtful.\" She was a little critical, however, of her mother still,\r\nand thought her habits self-indulgent. Poor lady! she was 78; she had\r\nbeen shaken and bruised in a carriage accident, and was threatened with\r\nthe loss of her eye-sight. Certainly, Florence was not always able to\r\nmake due allowances for other people. But if she was critical of others,\r\nshe was yet more severe with herself. During this holiday at Embley, she\r\nresumed those written self-examinations and meditations for which,\r\nfrequent in her earlier years, she seems to have found little time\r\nduring the strenuous decade 1856-66. \"I never failed in energy,\" she\r\nsaid once in later years; \"but to do everything from the best\r\nmotive--that is quite another thing.\" In reviewing her past life on\r\nOctober 21, 1866, the anniversary of her departure for the Crimea, and\r\non subsequent days, she seems to have had a like thought. Her\r\nmeditations were not so much of what she had done as of what she had\r\ndone amiss; her resolutions were of greater purity of motive, and\r\ngreater peace, through a more entire trust in God: \"Called to be the\r\n'handmaid of the Lord,' and I have complained of my suffering life! What\r\nreturn does God expect from me--with what _purity of heart_ and\r\n_intention_ should I make an offering of myself to Him! The word of the\r\nLord unto thee: He was oppressed and he was afflicted, yet he opened not\r\nhis mouth.... But, when we are ill, how can we be like God? I look up\r\nand see the drops of dew, blue, golden, green, and red, glittering in\r\nthe sun on the top of the deciduous cypress--_that_ is like God. We see\r\nHim for a moment--we perceive His beauty. It lights us, even when we lie\r\nhere prostrate.... Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see\r\nGod--in all temptation, trials, and aridities, in the agony and bloody\r\nsweat, in the Cross and Passion: this is not the prerogative of the\r\nfuture life, but of the present.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  PART VI\r\n\r\n                               MANY THREADS\r\n\r\n                                (1867-1872)\r\n\r\n\r\n     I beg of you and pray you to look back upon the past with\r\n     thankfulness and upon the future with hope--when there has been so\r\n     much done and there is so much to do ... many beginnings and\r\n     ravelled threads to be woven in and completed.--BENJAMIN JOWETT\r\n     (_Letter to Miss Nightingale_, 1867).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                             WORKHOUSE REFORM\r\n\r\n                                (1864-1867)\r\n\r\n\r\n     From the first I had a sort of fixed faith that Florence\r\n     Nightingale could do anything, and that faith is still fresh in me;\r\n     and so it came to pass that the instant that name entered the lists\r\n     I felt the fight was virtually won, and I feel this still.--\r\n     H. B. FARNELL, Poor Law Inspector (Dec. 1866).\r\n\r\nFifty years ago the state of things which Miss Nightingale had seen, and\r\ncured, in the military hospitals during the Crimean War was almost\r\nequalled, and was in some respects surpassed in scandal, by the\r\ncondition of the peace hospitals for the sick poor at home. Those\r\nhospitals were the sick wards or infirmaries of workhouses, for the\r\nhospitals usually so-called skim only the surface of sickness in any\r\ngreat town. The state of the Metropolitan workhouses, as reported upon\r\nby the Poor Law Board in 1866, showed that the sick wards were for the\r\nmost part insanitary and overcrowded; that the beds were insufficient\r\nand admirably contrived to induce sores; that the eating and drinking\r\nvessels were unclean; that there was a deficiency of basins, towels,\r\nbrushes and combs; that the food for the patients was cooked by paupers\r\nand frequently served cold; that although the medical officers did their\r\nduty to the best of their ability, the attendance given and the salaries\r\npaid were inadequate to the needs of the sick. As for the nursing, it\r\nwas done by paupers, many of whom could neither read nor write, whose\r\nlove of drink often drove them to rob the sick of stimulants, and whose\r\ntreatment of the poor was characterized neither by judgment nor by\r\ngentleness. This is the restrained euphemism of an official report.[74]\r\nSometimes a patient would miss the ministration of a nurse for days\r\nbecause the pauper charged to give it was herself bed-ridden. The rule\r\nof one nurse was to give medicine three times a day to the very ill and\r\nonce to the rather ill. It was administered in a gallipot; the nurse\r\n\"poured out the medicine and judged according.\" Cases were reported in\r\nwhich a patient's bed was not made for five days and nights; in which\r\npatients had no food from 4 o'clock in the afternoon of one day to 8\r\no'clock in the morning of the next; in which patients died, or, to speak\r\nmore correctly, were killed, by the most wanton neglect.\r\n\r\n  [74] Mr. Farnall's Report, 1866, summarized in the Majority Report of\r\n       the Poor Law Commission, 1909, p. 239. The statements which follow\r\n       above are from _An Account of the Condition of the Infirmaries of\r\n       London Workhouses, Printed for the Association for the Improvement\r\n       of Infirmaries_, 1866.\r\n\r\nThe dawn of a better day came with the passing of the Metropolitan Poor\r\nAct of 1867, an Act which figures in histories of the Poor Law in this\r\ncountry as \"the starting-point of the modern development of Poor Law\r\nmedical relief.\" Many persons contributed to this reform. In the case of\r\nLondon, a \"Commission,\" instituted by the _Lancet_, under Mr. Ernest\r\nHart, which afterwards developed into the \"Association for the\r\nImprovement of the Infirmaries of London Workhouses,\" should especially\r\nbe mentioned. But the person who inspired the proper nursing of the sick\r\npoor, and who, behind the scenes, was a prime mover in the legislation\r\nof 1867, was Florence Nightingale.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThe reform began in Liverpool, and the initiative was due to a\r\nphilanthropist of that city, Mr. William Rathbone. He used to speak of\r\nMiss Nightingale as his \"beloved Chief\"; and she, when he died, sent a\r\nwreath inscribed \"In remembrance and humblest love of one of God's best\r\nand greatest sons.\" His voluminous correspondence with her began in 1861\r\nwhen he was desirous of introducing a system of District Nursing among\r\nthe poor of Liverpool. There were no trained nurses anywhere to be had,\r\nand he consulted Miss Nightingale. She suggested to him that Liverpool\r\nhad better train nurses for itself in its own principal hospital, the\r\nRoyal Infirmary. Mr. Rathbone took up the idea, and built a Training\r\nSchool and Home for Nurses. This institution provided nurses both for\r\nthe Royal Infirmary and for poor patients in their own homes. Miss\r\nNightingale gave to all Mr. Rathbone's plans as close and constant\r\nconsideration \"as if she were going to be herself the matron.\"[75] The\r\nscheme was started in 1862, and it proved so great a success that\r\nMr. Rathbone was encouraged to attempt an extension of his benevolent\r\nenterprise. The Workhouse Infirmary at Liverpool was believed to be\r\nbetter than most places of its kind; but there, as elsewhere, the\r\nnursing--if so it could be called--was done by able-bodied pauper women.\r\nAble-bodied women who enter workhouses are never among the mentally and\r\nmorally efficient; and in a seaport like Liverpool they were of an\r\nespecially low and vicious kind. The work of the nurses, selected from\r\nthis unpromising material, \"was superintended by a very small number of\r\npaid but untrained parish officers, who were in the habit, it was said,\r\nof wearing kid gloves in the wards to protect their hands. All night a\r\npoliceman patrolled some of the wards to keep order, while others, in\r\nwhich the inmates were too sick or infirm to make disturbance, were\r\nlocked up and left unvisited all night.\"[76] On Jan. 31, 1864, Mr.\r\nRathbone wrote to Miss Nightingale, propounding a plan for introducing a\r\nstaff of trained nurses and promising to guarantee the cost for a term\r\nof years if she would help with counsel and by finding a suitable Lady\r\nSuperintendent. He asked for two letters--\"one for influence,\" to be\r\nshown to the Vestry, the other for his private advice.[77] She and Dr.\r\nSutherland drew up the required documents; she arranged that twelve\r\n\"Nightingale Nurses\" should be sent from St. Thomas's Hospital; and she\r\nselected a Lady Superintendent--a choice on which, as both she and\r\nMr. Rathbone felt, everything would depend. The Vestry agreed in May to\r\naccept Mr. Rathbone's scheme, but many months passed before it was\r\nactually launched. \"There has been as much diplomacy,\" wrote Miss\r\nNightingale to the Mother of the Bermondsey Convent (Sept. 3, 1864),\r\n\"and as many treaties, and as much of people working against each other,\r\nas if we had been going to occupy a kingdom instead of a Workhouse.\" The\r\ncorrespondence forms one of the bulkiest bundles among Miss\r\nNightingale's Papers.\r\n\r\n  [75] Rathbone's _Organization of Nursing in a Large Town_, p. 30.\r\n\r\n  [76] _William Rathbone: a Memoir_, p. 166.\r\n\r\n  [77] The public letter (Feb. 5, 1864) is printed in Mr. Rathbone's\r\n       _Workhouse Nursing: The Story of a Successful Experiment_\r\n       (Macmillan, 1867).\r\n\r\nThe Lady Superintendent--the pioneer of workhouse nursing--was Miss\r\nAgnes Jones, an Irish girl, daughter of Colonel Jones, of Fahan,\r\nLondonderry, and niece of Sir John Lawrence. She was attractive and\r\nrich, young and witty, but intensely religious and devoted to her\r\nwork.[78] \"Ideal in her beauty,\" Miss Nightingale said of her;[79] \"like\r\na Louis XIV. shepherdess.\" She was one of the many girls who had been\r\nthrilled by Miss Nightingale's volunteering for the Crimea. \"Perhaps it\r\nis well,\" she wrote, when entering St. Thomas's Hospital, \"that I shall\r\nbear the name of a 'Nightingale Probationer,' for that honoured name is\r\nassociated with my first thought of hospital life. In the winter of\r\n1854, when I had those first longings for work and had for months so\r\nlittle to satisfy them, how I wished I were competent to join the\r\nNightingale band when they started for the Crimea! I listened to the\r\nanimadversions of many, but I almost worshipped her who braved them\r\nall.\" In 1860 Miss Jones followed in her heroine's steps to\r\nKaiserswerth. In 1862 she introduced herself to Miss Nightingale, who\r\nadvised her to complete her apprenticeship by a year's training at St.\r\nThomas's. \"Hitherto,\" the Matron reported to Miss Nightingale (Feb. 25,\r\n1863), \"I have had no lady probationer equal on all points to Miss\r\nJones.\" After completing her year's training at St. Thomas's she took\r\nservice as a nurse in the Great Northern Hospital, and she was there\r\nwhen the invitation came to Liverpool. Miss Jones was at first\r\ndiffident, but after an interview with Miss Nightingale \"the conviction\r\nwas borne in upon her,\" as she wrote, that it was God's call and\r\ntherefore must be obeyed in trust and with good hope.\r\n\r\n  [78] See \"Una and the Lion,\" in _Good Words_, June 1868 (Bibliography A,\r\n       No. 51).\r\n\r\n  [79] Letter to Madame Mohl, June 13, 1868.\r\n\r\nIn the history of modern nursing in this country the Sixteenth of May\r\n1865 is a date only less memorable than the Twenty-fourth of June 1860.\r\nOn the earlier day the Nightingale Training School was opened at St.\r\nThomas's; on the latter twelve trained Nightingale nurses began work in\r\nthe Liverpool Infirmary, and the reform of workhouse nursing was therein\r\ninaugurated. Miss Jones herself had arrived a few weeks earlier.\r\nMr. Rathbone felt the importance of the occasion, and marked it by a\r\npretty attention to Miss Nightingale. \"I beg,\" he wrote (May 12, Miss\r\nNightingale's birthday), \"to be allowed to constitute myself your\r\ngardener to the extent of doing what I have long wished--providing a\r\nflower-stand for your room and keeping it supplied with plants. I hope\r\nyou will not be offended with my presumption or refuse me the great\r\npleasure of thinking that in your daily work you may have with you a\r\nreminder of my affectionate gratitude for all you have done for our town\r\nand for me. If the plants will only flourish, as the good seed you have\r\nplanted here is doing, they will be bright enough; and as for my\r\npersonal obligations, you can never know how great they are to you for\r\nguiding me to and in this work.\" Mr. Rathbone and other kindly Liverpool\r\nmen (among whom Mr. J. W. Cropper should be remembered) were equally\r\nthoughtful of Miss Jones. At their own expense they furnished rooms for\r\nher in the workhouse, and made them bright with flowers and pictures.\r\nBut it was a formidable task to which she was called, and the\r\npleasantness of her rooms made the workhouse wards look yet more\r\nterrible, she said, by contrast. A young woman, well-bred, sensitive,\r\nand refined, accustomed as yet only to well-appointed hospitals, was\r\nthrown into the rough-and-tumble of great pauper wards, where the\r\nofficials, though well-intentioned, had necessarily caught something of\r\nthe surrounding atmosphere. \"Your kind letter,\" she had written to Miss\r\nNightingale, after a preliminary visit (Aug. 1864), \"came in answer to\r\nearnest prayer, and gave me courage so that even now while waiting for\r\nthe committee I do not feel nervous. The governor has promised me every\r\nco-operation and told me 'not to be down-hearted if the undertaking\r\nseemed formidable at first, as he would pull me through everything.'\r\nYou will laugh when I tell you how at first his want of refinement\r\nprejudiced me, but his earnest hearty initiative in the whole work has\r\nquite won me.\" Their relations afterwards were only indifferently good.\r\nMiss Jones's standard was too strict, he thought, for rough workhouse\r\nways.\r\n\r\nThe greatest shock to Miss Jones, however, was the nature of the human\r\nbeings whom she was sent to nurse. Sin and wickedness, she said, had\r\nhitherto been only names to her. Now she was plunged into a sink of\r\nhuman corruption. The foul language, the drunkenness, the vicious\r\nhabits, the bodily and mental degradation on all sides appalled her. The\r\nwards, she said in her first letter from the workhouse, are \"like\r\nDante's _Inferno_.\" \"Una and the Lion\"[80] was the title given by Miss\r\nNightingale to her account of Agnes Jones and her paupers, \"far more\r\nuntamable than lions.\" She had, it is true, the help of twelve trained\r\nnurses, devoted alike to her and to their work; but there were 1200\r\ninmates, and of the other \"nurses\" some were probationers of an\r\nindifferent class, and the rest \"pauper nurses,\" of whom Miss Jones had\r\nto dismiss 35 in the first few months for drunkenness. Then, the\r\nstandard of workhouse cleanliness was sadly low. She found that the men\r\nwore the same shirts for seven weeks. Bed-clothes were sometimes not\r\nwashed for months. The diet was hopelessly meagre compared to a hospital\r\nstandard. It is \"Scutari over again,\" wrote Miss Nightingale, and Miss\r\nJones was strengthened by the thought that the disciple was experiencing\r\nsome of the difficulties which had beset the Mistress. By way of\r\nsmoothing things over, Miss Nightingale had written to the governor of\r\nthe workhouse saying, in effect, that the eyes of the world were upon\r\nhim as the leader in a great reform; and he \"seemed so gratified and\r\nflattered by your letter,\" reported Miss Jones. Miss Nightingale was\r\nconstant in advice and encouragement to her disciple. \"No one ever helps\r\nand encourages me as you do.\" \"I could never pull through without you.\"\r\n\"God bless you for all your kindness.\" Such expressions show how\r\nwelcome and how unfailing was Miss Nightingale's help. And in every\r\ndetail she was consulted. There was all the friction which usually\r\naccompanies a new experiment. There were disputes of every kind, and all\r\nwere referred to Miss Nightingale--sometimes by Mr. Rathbone, sometimes\r\nby Miss Jones, sometimes by both. When things seemed critical, Mr.\r\nRathbone would come up to see Miss Nightingale in person; on less\r\nserious occasions he would write. Miss Nightingale and Dr. Sutherland\r\nwould then sit as a kind of Conciliation Board, and see how matters\r\ncould be adjusted. In one of Dr. Sutherland's draft judgments submitted\r\nfor Miss Nightingale's concurrence there is a blank left for her to\r\nfill, as the note explains, with \"soft sawder.\" His breezy manner may\r\nsometimes have been of comfort to his friend. On one occasion, when\r\neverything at Liverpool seemed to be at sixes and sevens, his note to\r\nMiss Nightingale was: \"I don't despair by any means. The entire\r\nproceeding has in it the elements of an Irish row, for they are all more\r\nor less Hibernian there, and they will cool down.\" And so they did. Miss\r\nJones, who was at first a little too stiff-necked, soon found out a more\r\nexcellent way, and there is \"the Nightingale touch\" in many of her later\r\nreports. \"To-day they were a little cross, but I got my way all the\r\nsame.\" She is \"much amused at the manner in which she now gets all she\r\nasks for.\" She suggests things. She is laughed at. She persists. A\r\ndecent interval is allowed to elapse; and then the things are suggested\r\nto her by the officials; she says the suggestions are excellent, and the\r\nthings are done. It is obvious to Miss Nightingale and Dr. Sutherland\r\nthat sooner or later the powers of the Lady Superintendent must be\r\nbetter defined; obvious, too, that the worthless probationers and\r\ndrunken pauper \"nurses\" must be cleared out; but that is just one of the\r\nthings that the experiment is meant to prove, and meanwhile it is enough\r\nto drive in the thin end of the wedge. So well does Miss Jones do her\r\nwork that opinion, in the workhouse and outside, begins even to be\r\nimpatient for the thicker end. The experiment has so far been limited to\r\nthe male wards. The doctors go to Miss Jones and ask eagerly when she\r\nand more Nightingale nurses are to be given charge of the female wards\r\nalso. Old women who go in to see their husbands or brothers report\r\nwonderful changes in the House since \"the London nurses\" came. Visiting\r\nladies report to the same effect. The experiment is becoming popular;\r\nand the Liverpool Vestry begins to wonder whether the cost hitherto\r\nborne by Mr. Rathbone's private purse should not be thrown upon the\r\nrates. Miss Nightingale has good cause to be pleased. She has been\r\nthrowing herself into the work, not only in order to make the particular\r\nexperiment a success, but also because she wants to use it as a lever\r\nfor promoting larger reforms.\r\n\r\n  [80] See Book I. chap. iii. stanzas 4 _seq._ of _The Faerie Queene_:--\r\n\r\n                                       \"Her angel's face\r\n               As the great eye of heaven shyned bright,\r\n               And made a sunshine in the shady place, etc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nLiverpool had shown the way, and Miss Nightingale resolved in her own\r\nmind that the way should be followed in London. The struggle was long\r\nand arduous; the fortune of political war went at a critical moment\r\nagainst her; the victory of 1867 was only partial, and indeed there are\r\nother parts of her designs which even to this day await fruition. But\r\nthe insight with which from the very first, as her Papers show, she\r\nseized the essential positions was masterly. I can understand how it was\r\nthat Mr. Charles Villiers, not usually given to such outbursts of\r\nadmiration, exclaimed to a friend: \"I delight to read the Nightingale's\r\nsong about it all. If any of them had the tenth part of her vigour of\r\nmind we might expect something.\"\r\n\r\nThe opening move in her campaign was made in December 1864. There had\r\nbeen an inquest on the death of one Timothy Daly, which had figured in\r\nthe newspapers as \"Horrible Treatment of a Pauper.\" The facts, as\r\nultimately sifted, were not in this particular case as bad as they were\r\npainted in the press, but the circumstances were distressing and public\r\nopinion was excited. The situation was in that favourable condition for\r\nmoving Ministers when there is a feeling in the air that \"something must\r\nbe done.\" Miss Nightingale seized the opportunity to open communications\r\nwith the President of the Poor Law Board, Mr. Villiers. She did not in\r\nthis first letter disclose her whole scheme, though she said just enough\r\nto show that she had considered the subject in its larger bearings. She\r\nknew the art of beginning on a moderate, and even a humble, note. She\r\npresumed to write because the case involved a question of nursing, in\r\nwhich matter she had had some practical experience; she had, moreover,\r\nbeen \"put in trust by her fellow-countrymen with the means of training\r\nnurses.\" She described what was to be done in the Liverpool Infirmary by\r\na Matron who had been trained under the \"Nightingale Fund,\" and she\r\ninvited the Minister's attention to the possibility of preventing the\r\nscandals, with which the newspapers were ringing, by starting some\r\nscheme of a like kind in London. This letter, in the composition of\r\nwhich Dr. Sutherland had a hand, went straight to its mark. Mr. Villiers\r\nat once replied (Dec. 31, 1864) that he would like to communicate with\r\nMiss Nightingale personally on the subject. In January the interview\r\ntook place, and this was the beginning of a long series of personal and\r\nwritten communications between them during the next few years. On one\r\noccasion early in 1865 Mr. Villiers, being prevented by official\r\nbusiness from keeping an appointment with Miss Nightingale, begged her\r\nto receive in his place his right-hand man, Mr. H. B. Farnall, Poor Law\r\nInspector for the Metropolitan district. Mr. Farnall called, and he and\r\nMiss Nightingale became as thick as conspirators in no time. For Poor\r\nLaw purposes he soon became the Chief of her Staff. Mr. Farnall was a\r\nman after her own heart. He not only knew the facts with which he had to\r\ndeal, but he felt them, with something of her \"divine impatience.\" \"It's\r\nintolerable to me,\" he said, \"to know that there are some 12,000 gasping\r\nand miserable sick poor whom we might solace and perhaps in some 5000\r\ncases save, and yet that we have to let them wait while the world gets\r\nready to get out of bed and think about it all.\" He was a keen and\r\nbroad-minded reformer, and Miss Nightingale's ideas were upon lines\r\nwhich he too had considered. He was an old official hand, but he hated\r\nofficial obstruction: \"all this is treason to King Red Tape, but I know\r\nthat the old King is always happy _after_ a change, though he gets very\r\nred while the change progresses.\" Miss Nightingale instantly set her new\r\nally to work. Here, as in all that she undertook, she knew that the\r\nfirst thing needful was to collect the facts. She drew up a schedule of\r\ninquiries, to be filled up with regard to all the sick-wards and\r\ninfirmaries in London. \"I will immediately issue your Forms,\" wrote\r\nMr. Farnall (Feb. 16, 1865). He required them to be filled up in\r\nduplicate, and Miss Nightingale's set of them is preserved amongst her\r\nPapers. Throughout the year she and Mr. Farnall were engaged in the work\r\nof inspiring and incensing Mr. Villiers in the direction of radical\r\nreform. He was throughout very willing, but he was becoming an old man,\r\nhe had many other things to think about, and he was apt to see lions in\r\nthe path. Moreover, not all the officials at the Poor Law Board were\r\nreformers; there were those, more highly placed than Mr. Farnall, who\r\nwere of a very different opinion; and some of the medical officers were\r\ninclined to dispute the necessity of any radical changes. However, on\r\nthe subject of workhouse nursing, Mr. Villiers promptly authorized\r\nMr. Farnall to press upon the Guardians the importance of employing\r\ncompetent nurses, and he told the House of Commons (May 5) that \"in\r\nconsequence of communications lately received at the Poor Law Board from\r\nMiss Nightingale, who was now taking much interest in the matter,\" he\r\nwas hopeful that great reforms in nursing might come about. She,\r\nhowever, knew perfectly well that the only way to such reform was by\r\nreform also in administration and finance. In the following month\r\nMr. Farnall persuaded his Chief to insinuate into an innocent little\r\n\"Poor Law Board Continuation Bill,\" a clause which would enable the\r\nBoard to _compel_ Guardians to improve their workhouses; but the clause\r\nwas struck out, Mr. Farnall was disappointed, and Miss Nightingale wrote\r\nto reassure him. They must work all the harder to secure, not by a\r\nside-wind, but by a direct move in the next session of Parliament, a\r\nfull and far-reaching measure of reform. \"Your kind note,\" said\r\nMr. Farnall (July 3), \"has done me a world of good; there is not a\r\nsingle expression or hope in it which I cannot make my own. So we hope\r\ntogether for next year's ripened fruit. I hope, too, that we may really\r\ntaste it. I pledge myself to you to relax in nothing till the task is\r\ndone. It is something to live for, and something to have heard you say\r\nthat such a victory will some day be claimed by me. It is a pleasant\r\nthing to think of, and I shall think of it as a soldier thinks of his\r\nFlag.\"\r\n\r\nSo, then, Miss Nightingale set to work, with the help of Mr. Farnall and\r\nDr. Sutherland, in elaborating a scheme for 1866. There are several\r\ndrafts in her handwriting for the Memorandum finally submitted to\r\nMr. Villiers, and many notes and emendations by Dr. Sutherland. The\r\nscheme was sent also (at a later date) to Mr. Chadwick (one of the few\r\nsurvivors of the famous Poor Law Commission of 1834) in order that he\r\nmight submit it to John Stuart Mill, whom Miss Nightingale sought to\r\nenlist in the cause.[81] The essential points and considerations were\r\nthese:--\r\n\r\n     A. To insist on the great principle of separating the Sick, Insane,\r\n     \"Incurable,\" and, above all, the Children, from the usual\r\n     population of the Metropolis.\r\n\r\n     B. To advocate a single Central Administration.\r\n\r\n     C. To place the Sick, Insane, etc., under a distinct\r\n     administration, supported by a \"General Hospital Rate\" to be levied\r\n     for this purpose over the whole Metropolitan area.\r\n\r\n     These are the ABC of the reform required.\r\n\r\n     (A) So long as a sick man, woman, or child is considered\r\n     _administratively_ to be a pauper to be repressed, and not a\r\n     fellow-creature to be nursed into health, so long will these most\r\n     shameful disclosures have to be made. The care and government of\r\n     the _sick_ poor is a thing totally different from the government of\r\n     paupers. Why do we have Hospitals in order to cure, and Workhouse\r\n     Infirmaries in order _not_ to cure? Taken solely from the point of\r\n     view of preventing pauperism, what a stupidity and anomaly this\r\n     is!... The past system of mixing up all kinds of poor in workhouses\r\n     will never be submitted to in future. The very first thing wanted\r\n     is classification and separation.\r\n\r\n     (B) Uniformity of system is absolutely necessary, both for\r\n     efficiency and for economy.\r\n\r\n     (C) For the purpose of providing suitable establishments for the\r\n     care and treatment of the Sick, Insane, etc., consolidation and a\r\n     General Rate are essential. To provide suitable treatment in each\r\n     Workhouse would involve an expenditure which even London could not\r\n     bear. The entire Medical Relief of London should be under one\r\n     central management which would know where vacant beds were to be\r\n     found, and be able so to distribute the Sick, etc., as to use all\r\n     the establishments in the most economical way.\r\n\r\n  [81] Mill was at the time a member of a Select Committee on the Local\r\n       Government and Local Taxation of the Metropolis; see above, p. 106.\r\n       The Committee did not, however, touch Poor Law Administration.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale elaborated her views in detail, going into the\r\nquestions of Hospitals, Nursing, Workhouse Schools, etc. The cardinal\r\npoint was what Mr. Farnall spoke of to her as \"your Hospital and Asylum\r\nRate.\" The Minister was favourable to the idea. \"I have conferred with\r\nMr. Villiers,\" wrote Mr. Farnall (Dec. 12), \"and he has decided on\r\nadopting your scheme. He thinks it will be popular and just, and I think\r\nso also, but I think too that it will be the means of my carrying out a\r\nfurther reform some of these days. That is my hope and belief. If your\r\nplans are carried my struggle is half over. Under these circumstances I\r\nshall to-morrow commence a list of facts for you on which those who are\r\nto support your plan in print will be able to hang a considerable amount\r\nof flesh, for I shall furnish a very nice skeleton.\" Miss Nightingale\r\nhad already, through an intermediary, interested the editor of the\r\n_Times_ in the matter, and he had been to see Mr. Villiers. Further\r\npublic support came from the Association above mentioned (p. 124), which\r\nsent a deputation to the Poor Law Board. Mr. Villiers in reply (April\r\n14, 1866) foreshadowed legislation on Miss Nightingale's lines, and he\r\nappointed Mr. Farnall and another of her friends, Dr. Angus Smith, to\r\ninspect all the Infirmaries. Their Report has already been cited. Public\r\nopinion was ripe for radical reform; but the Whig Ministry was\r\ntottering, no fresh contentious legislation was deemed advisable, and in\r\nJune 1866 Mr. Villiers was out. The opportunity had passed, and Miss\r\nNightingale was left crying, \"Alas! Alas! Alas!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nShe was not one, however, to waste much time in empty lamentations. She\r\nhad to begin over again, that was all; and she wrote at once, as we have\r\nheard,[82] to the new Minister. She also procured an introduction for\r\nMr. Farnall to Lord Derby, and the Prime Minister seemed sympathetic.\r\nMr. Hardy had answered politely, but did not follow up his letter, and\r\nhis first move seemed sinister. He dismissed Mr. Farnall from Whitehall\r\nand sent him to the Yorkshire Poor Law District. The anti-reform party\r\nwas believed to have gained the ascendant. But now a fortunate thing\r\nhappened. Mr. Hardy made a speech in which he implied that the existing\r\nlaws were adequate, if properly enforced, to meet the case. Technically\r\nthere was a measure of truth in this statement, but in practice it was\r\nfallacious;[83] and in any case Mr. Hardy's remark was a reflection on\r\nhis predecessor's administration. This nettled Mr. Villiers greatly; he\r\nwas \"not going to sit down under it,\" he said; he became red-hot for\r\nreform; very much on the alert, too, to trip his successor up. Miss\r\nNightingale did not fail to add fuel to the flame. Mr. Villiers\r\ncorresponded with her at great length; saw her repeatedly; reported all\r\nhe was able to learn of how things were going at Whitehall, and begged\r\nher to do the like for him. \"The public are led to infer,\" he said to\r\nher, \"that nothing was needed but a touch from Mr. Hardy's wand to set\r\nall things straight.\" The public, thought Miss Nightingale also, would\r\nsoon discover his mistake. Mr. Hardy would find that he had either to do\r\nnothing, or to legislate; unless indeed the Tory Ministry were\r\noverthrown first.\r\n\r\n  [82] Above, p. 115.\r\n\r\n  [83] Previous legislation had _empowered_ Guardians to separate the\r\n       sick, etc., but had set up no administrative or financial machinery.\r\n\r\nNow, Miss Nightingale was a Whig, and she, too, would have been glad\r\nenough to see the Tories out and Mr. Villiers in again at the Poor Law\r\nBoard. But there was something that she cared about a great deal more,\r\nnamely, that the neglect of the sick poor should be remedied at the\r\nearliest possible moment; and as the Tories might after all weather the\r\nstorm, she must see what she could do to get a Poor Law Bill out of\r\nthem. In the autumn Mr. Hardy appointed a Committee, mainly composed of\r\ndoctors, to report \"upon the requisite amount of space, and other\r\nmatters, in relation to workhouses and workhouse infirmaries.\" One of\r\nthe \"other matters\" was nursing, and the Committee, instead of\r\nexpressing an opinion on the subject themselves, asked Miss Nightingale\r\nto send them a Paper. In this Memorandum, dated Jan. 19, 1867, she made\r\nfull use of her opportunity; for she pointed out that the question of\r\nnursing could not, either in logic or in effective practice, be\r\nseparated from that of administration. \"In the recent inquiries,\" she\r\nwrote, \"the point which strikes an experienced hospital manager is not\r\nthe individual cases which have been made so much of (though these are\r\nstriking enough), but the view which the best Matrons, the best Masters,\r\nand other officials of the workhouses give from their own lips (in\r\nevidence) of what they considered their duties. These bore as little\r\nreference to what are usually considered (not by me alone, but by all\r\nChristendom) the duties of hospital superintendents as they bear to the\r\nduties of railway superintendents. Your Committee is probably well\r\nacquainted with the administration of the _Assistance Publique_ at\r\nParis. No great stretch of imagination is required to conceive what they\r\nthink of the system or no system reigning here.[84] I allude to the\r\nheaping up aged, infirm, sick, able-bodied, lunatics, and sometimes\r\nchildren in the same building instead of having, as in every other\r\nChristian country, your asylum for aged, your hospital for sick, your\r\nlunatic asylum, your union school, &c., &c., &c., each under its proper\r\nadministration, and your able-bodied quite apart from any of these\r\ncategories. This point is of such vital importance to the introduction\r\nand successful working of an efficient nursing system that I shall\r\nillustrate it....\" And she went on to outline her general scheme. In\r\naccordance with her usual custom, Miss Nightingale had copies of her\r\nPaper struck off separately, and circulated them among influential\r\npeople. The Committee had given her a platform, but its own Report was\r\nonly of subsidiary value. She put her point of view with a touch of\r\nexaggeration characteristic of her familiar letters to Captain Galton,\r\none of the members of the Committee. \"I look upon the cubic space as the\r\nleast of the evils--indeed as rather a good, for it is a very good thing\r\nto suffocate the pauper sick out of their misery.\" Meanwhile she thought\r\nit wholesome that the \"ins\" should know that the \"outs\" did not mean to\r\nlet the subject of Poor Law Reform be shelved. \"I have had a great deal\r\nof clandestine correspondence,\" she wrote to a friend who might pass\r\nthe information on (Oct. 28, 1866), \"with my old loves at the Poor Law\r\nBoard these last two months. The belief among the old loves is that the\r\nnew master is bent on--doing nothing. There is only one thing of which I\r\nam quite sure. And that is that Mr. Villiers will lead Mr. Gathorne\r\nHardy no easy life next February.\"\r\n\r\n  [84] M. Husson, Director of the _Assistance Publique_, had been in\r\n       London in 1865. Miss Nightingale had procured him various\r\n       introductions and facilities, and he had reported his impressions\r\n       to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nMr. Hardy kept his own counsel and made no sign. As the session drew\r\nnear, Miss Nightingale became anxious and she poured in letters and\r\nmemoranda upon him. In one of these she made what turned out to be an\r\nunfortunate mistake. She was too frank. She was pressing upon\r\nMr. Hardy's attention the importance of the Liverpool experiment, and in\r\nthe course of her exposition she said incidentally that there had been\r\ndifficulties. Mr. Hardy misinterpreted the remark and made use of it to\r\nexplain in the House of Commons why he did not propose to take any\r\ndirect action in the matter of nursing reform. Indirectly, however, his\r\nproposals did a great deal. On February 8, 1867, Mr. Hardy introduced\r\nhis Bill. So, legislation had, after all, been found necessary to meet\r\nthe demand that something must be done. To that extent, then,\r\nMr. Villiers had no need to make Mr. Hardy's life a burden to him. The\r\nquestion was, How much did the Bill do? and was what it did, good or\r\nbad? Those who had been working for reform were anxious to know what\r\nMiss Nightingale thought. \"I should amazingly like to hear,\" wrote\r\nMr. Villiers to her, \"what you say to this seven months' child born in\r\nthe workhouse at Whitehall.\" Mr. Ernest Hart's Association, whose\r\nattitude was summed up by Mr. Villiers as \"silenced but not satisfied,\"\r\napplied for her opinion. Her journalistic friends wanted hints. Dr.\r\nSutherland was told, in a note requiring his instant attention, that \"X.\r\nwants to know in what tone he is to write his article in the _Daily\r\nNews_,\" and that \"Y. will write an article in the _Pall Mall_ in any\r\nsense we wish.\" Now, whenever a Bill is introduced touching a question\r\nwhich demands, or admits of, large reforms, there are two points of\r\nview from which it may be regarded. One man compares what is proposed\r\nwith the existing state of things, and asks himself, Is there any\r\ndecided improvement? Another, comparing the proposals with what might\r\nexist in the future, asks, Does the Bill approximate to the ideal? The\r\nformer is the view which \"practical politicians\" take; the latter, the\r\nview which is apt to be taken by administrative enthusiasts. Miss\r\nNightingale's administrative mind saw chiefly, and at first saw only,\r\nthe points at which, and the measure in which, Mr. Hardy's Bill fell\r\nshort of logical perfection. It was a tentative measure; it was largely\r\npermissive; it did something to separate the sick and the children from\r\nthe ordinary paupers, but it did not do all. Moreover, so far as direct\r\nand express enactment went, it did nothing to improve workhouse nursing.\r\nMiss Nightingale pronounced the Bill, therefore, \"a humbug.\" Its\r\nprinciples were \"none\"; its details, \"beastly.\" She tried hard to get\r\nthe Bill amended and extended. Sir Harry Verney, who might perhaps be\r\ndescribed as \"Member of Parliament for Miss Nightingale,\" gave every\r\nassistance that was possible; and Mr. Mill, inspired largely by his old\r\nfriend Mr. Chadwick (with whom Miss Nightingale also was in constant\r\ncorrespondence), took a prominent part in the debates to the same end.\r\nBut he seldom pressed his points to a division, and there was little\r\nlife in the opposition. Mr. Villiers was as critical as he could\r\nreasonably be, but the real fact was that the Bill made a great and a\r\nsurprising step in the direction which Miss Nightingale had pressed upon\r\nhim. These were days in which Disraeli was educating his party in the\r\npolitical art of dishing the Whigs, and the difficulty was, as\r\nMr. Jowett wrote to Miss Nightingale, to discover any clear difference\r\nbetween a Tory and a Radical. Mr. Mill, with the candour that became a\r\nphilosopher, \"had no doubt that the Bill would effect a vast\r\nimprovement\"; Mr. Villiers, with the determination of the politician to\r\nscore a point, admitted that \"the Bill would set the ball rolling,\" and\r\nreflected that anything might presently come from a party which had been\r\nconverted \"from pure Conservatism to Household Suffrage in 48 hours\";\r\nand Mr. Hardy, in his conduct of the measure, was careful to conciliate\r\nthe other side. He agreed to all the objections \"in principle,\" pleaded\r\nthe difficulty of doing everything in a moment, and claimed for his Bill\r\nthat it was \"only a beginning.\" And so, in fact, it turned out; while,\r\neven at the time, the reforms made by the Bill, which became an Act on\r\nMarch 29, 1867, were sufficiently beneficent. The whole of the unions\r\nand parishes in London were formed, by an Order under the Act, into one\r\ndistrict, \"The Metropolitan Asylum District,\" for the treatment of\r\ninsane, fever, and small-pox cases, which had hitherto been dealt with in\r\nthe workhouses. Separate infirmaries were formed for the non-infectious\r\nsick, with a greatly enlarged cubic space per inmate. Dispensaries were\r\nestablished throughout the metropolis. Above all, the \"Metropolitan\r\nCommon Poor Fund\" (the \"Hospital and Asylum Rate\" of Miss Nightingale's\r\nMemorandum) was established, and to it were charged the maintenance of\r\nthe \"asylums,\" medicines, etc., and the maintenance of pauper children\r\nin separate schools. When the battle was lost--or won--Miss Nightingale\r\ncounted up the gains, and said, \"This is a beginning; we shall get more\r\nin time.\"[85] And such has been the case. The Act of 1867 was the\r\nfoundation on which many improvements in medical relief under the Poor\r\nLaw have been laid,[86] and the principles implied in the Act--the\r\nseparation of the sick from the paupers, and in the case of London the\r\nmaking medical relief a common charge--are likely to receive yet further\r\nrecognition. They are the principles for which Miss Nightingale\r\ncontended. Her influence in forming the public opinion which made the\r\nlegislation of 1867 possible was referred to in both Houses of\r\nParliament.[87]\r\n\r\n  [85] Letter to the Rev. Mother of Bermondsey, March 1867.\r\n\r\n  [86] The history of the matter is succinctly told in the Majority Report\r\n       of the Poor Law Commission, 1909, pp. 235 _seq._\r\n\r\n  [87] By Mr. Villiers in the House of Commons, February 21; and in the\r\n       House of Lords on March 19 by the Earl of Devon, who, in moving the\r\n       second reading of Mr. Hardy's Bill, said: \"It would be improper on\r\n       such an occasion to omit reference to the improved feeling on the\r\n       subject which had resulted from the admiration the country must feel\r\n       for the exertions of that excellent and gifted woman, Miss\r\n       Nightingale, whose name would always be received with that respect\r\n       which was due to her Christian activity and self-devotion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nSoon after the Act of 1867 came into operation, to the improvement of\r\nLondon workhouses, the pioneer of improved workhouse nursing died in\r\nLiverpool. The work of Miss Agnes Jones, whose early difficulties have\r\nbeen described above, had gone ahead with ever-increasing success. The\r\ndifficulties indeed continued, and throughout 1867 Miss Nightingale was\r\nstill busy in giving encouragement and advice; but the results of the\r\nwork were so satisfactory that in March 1867 the Liverpool Vestry\r\ndecided to extend the trained nursing to the female wards and to throw\r\nthe whole cost upon the rates. When the strain of the increased work was\r\nat its severest point, Miss Jones was attacked by fever, and she died on\r\nFebruary 19, 1868. To _Good Words_ in the following June Miss\r\nNightingale contributed a touching paper in memory of her friend and\r\ndisciple:--\r\n\r\n     She died as she had lived, at her post in one of the largest\r\n     workhouse infirmaries in the Kingdom. She lived the life, and died\r\n     the death, of the saints and martyrs; though the greatest sinner\r\n     would not have been more surprised than she to have heard this said\r\n     of herself. In less than three years she had reduced one of the\r\n     most disorderly hospital populations in the world to something like\r\n     Christian discipline, such as the police themselves wondered at.\r\n     She had converted a vestry to the conviction of the economy as well\r\n     as humanity of nursing pauper sick by trained nurses. She had\r\n     converted the Poor-Law Board--a body, perhaps, not usually given to\r\n     much enthusiasm. She had disarmed all opposition, all sectarian\r\n     zealotism; so that Roman Catholic and Unitarian, High Church and\r\n     Low Church, all literally rose up and called her \"blessed.\" All, of\r\n     all shades of religious creed, seemed to have merged their\r\n     differences in her, seeing in her the one true essential thing,\r\n     compared with which they acknowledged their differences to be as\r\n     nothing. And aged paupers made verses in her honour after her\r\n     death.\r\n\r\n     In less than three years--the time generally given to the ministry\r\n     on earth of that Saviour whom she so earnestly strove closely to\r\n     follow--she did all this. She had the gracefulness, the wit, the\r\n     unfailing cheerfulness--qualities so remarkable but so much\r\n     overlooked in our Saviour's life. She had the absence of all\r\n     asceticism, or \"mortification,\" for mortification's sake, which\r\n     characterized His work, and any real work in the present day as in\r\n     His day. And how did she do all this? She was not, when a girl, of\r\n     any conspicuous ability, except that she had cultivated in herself\r\n     to the utmost a power of getting through business in a short time,\r\n     without slurring it over and without fid-fadding at it;--real\r\n     business--her Father's business. She was always filled with the\r\n     thought that she must be about her \"Father's business.\" How can any\r\n     undervalue business-habits? as if anything could be done without\r\n     them. She could do, and she did do, more of her Father's business\r\n     in six hours than ordinary women do in six months, or than most of\r\n     even the best women do in six days.... What she went through during\r\n     her workhouse life is scarcely known but to God and to one or two.\r\n     Yet she said that she had \"never been so happy in all her life.\"\r\n     All the last winter she had under her charge above 50 nurses and\r\n     probationers, above 150 pauper scourers, from 1290 to 1350\r\n     patients, being from two to three hundred more than the number of\r\n     beds. All this she had to provide for and arrange for, often\r\n     receiving an influx of patients without a moment's warning. She had\r\n     to manage and persuade the patients to sleep three and four in two\r\n     beds; sometimes six, or even eight children had to be put in one\r\n     bed; and being asked on one occasion whether they did not \"kick one\r\n     another,\" they answered, \"Oh, no, ma'am, we're so comfor'ble.\" Poor\r\n     little things, they scarcely remembered ever to have slept in a bed\r\n     before. But this is not the usual run of workhouse life. And, if\r\n     any one would know what are the lowest depths of human vice and\r\n     misery, would see the festering mass of decay of living human\r\n     bodies and human souls, and then would try what one loving soul,\r\n     filled with the spirit of her God, can do to let in the light of\r\n     God into this hideous well (worse than the well of Cawnpore), to\r\n     bind up the wounds, to heal the broken-hearted, to bring release to\r\n     the captives--let her study the ways, and follow in the steps of\r\n     this one young, frail woman, who has died to show us the\r\n     way--blessed in her death as in her life.\r\n\r\nThe death of Miss Jones involved Miss Nightingale in much anxiety and\r\nadditional responsibility. \"The whole work of finding her successor has\r\nfallen upon me,\" she wrote to Madame Mohl (March 20); \"and in addition\r\nthey expect me to manage the Workhouse at Liverpool from my bedroom.\"\r\nAnd again (April 30): \"I have seven or eight hours a day additional\r\nwriting for the last two months about this Liverpool workhouse.\" The\r\nbundle of correspondence on the subject makes this statement quite\r\ncredible. \"I believe I have found a successor[88] at last. I don't\r\nthink anything in the course of my long life ever struck me so much as\r\nthe deadlock we have been placed in by the death of one pupil--combined,\r\nyou know, with the enormous _jaw_, the infinite female ink which England\r\npours forth on 'Woman's Work.' It used to be said that people gave their\r\n_blood_ to their country. Now they give their _ink_.\" Miss Nightingale's\r\nfirst concern was to put heart and strength into the nurses who were now\r\ndeprived of their Chief. Writing as their \"affectionate friend and\r\nfellow-sufferer,\" she called upon them to fight the good fight without\r\nflinching. \"Many battles which seemed desperate while the General lived\r\nhave been fought and won by the soldiers who, when they saw their\r\nGeneral fall, were determined to save his name and win the ground he had\r\ndied for. And shall we fight a heavenly battle, a battle to cure the\r\nbodies and souls of God's poor, less well than men fight an earthly\r\nbattle to kill and wound?\" \"The nurses have been splendid,\" she was able\r\nto report presently. Miss Nightingale concluded her paper in _Good\r\nWords_ with a stirring appeal to others--Poor Law officials, on their\r\npart, and devoted women, on theirs--to go and do likewise. \"The Son of\r\nGod goes forth to war, who follows in his train? Oh, daughters of God,\r\nare there so few to answer?\" The appeal awoke a response in at least one\r\nheart. One of the most valued of Miss Nightingale's disciples ascribed\r\nher call to this article in _Good Words_. \"Some of us,\" she says, \"who\r\nwere children in the days of the Crimean War when Miss Nightingale's\r\nmost famous work was done, were responsible girls at home, nursing as\r\noccasion arose in our families, by the light of her _Notes_, to the\r\nmusic of Longfellow's verse, when once again she came before us,\r\nflashing out of her retirement with the trumpet-call of 'Una.'\" Many are\r\nnow called to such work, but few, I suppose, are chosen--in the sense of\r\nbeing found worthy to do the work in the spirit of Agnes Jones. The\r\nLiverpool experiment, rendered successful by her devotion, rapidly made\r\nits mark. In ten years' time the system of employing pauper inmates as\r\nnurses had been entirely superseded, in all sick asylums and separate\r\ninfirmaries, by paid nurses. In 1897 the employment of pauper nurses in\r\nany workhouse was forbidden, and the training of the paid nurses has\r\nbeen continuously improved.[89] To Miss Nightingale, here as in all her\r\nundertakings, each point gained was only a step on the road to\r\nperfectibility. Among some communings with herself, written in 1867,\r\nthere is this entry: \"Easter Sunday. Never think that you have done\r\nanything effectual in nursing in London till you nurse, not only the\r\nsick poor in workhouses, but those at home.\"\r\n\r\n  [88] Miss L. Freeman.\r\n\r\n  [89] For details on this subject, see Majority Report, 1909, pp. 240-242.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                      ALLIANCE WITH SIR BARTLE FRERE\r\n\r\n                                (1867-1868)\r\n\r\n\r\n     Truly these poor people will have cause to bless you long after\r\n     English Viceroys and dynasties are of the past.--SIR BARTLE FRERE\r\n     (_Letter to Miss Nightingale_, May 6, 1869).\r\n\r\nWhen Sidney Herbert died, his work as an army reformer was in part\r\narrested because he had never put in what Miss Nightingale called \"the\r\nmain-spring.\" He had failed to reform the War Office. There had thus been\r\nno such effective organization set up as would ensure even the permanent\r\npossession of ground already gained and much less a continuous advance.\r\nThere was now some danger of a like state of things in connection with\r\nPublic Health in India, and Miss Nightingale turned her thoughts to\r\navert it.\r\n\r\nThere had been many improvements; but there was as yet no consistent\r\nscheme of organization, and in some respects there had already been\r\nbacksliding. The Sanitary Commissions had been reduced on the ground of\r\nexpense to two officers (a President and a Secretary) in each case, and\r\na further retrenchment was now in contemplation. Under each Local\r\nGovernment there was to be one sanitary officer, and it was proposed\r\nthat this officer should be the Inspector-General of Prisons. A\r\n\"Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India\" would remain, who\r\nwould not combine that duty with an inspectorship of prisons; but such a\r\nscheme would assuredly not supply any \"mainspring\" for sanitary\r\nimprovement. Meanwhile Sir John Lawrence's term of office was coming to\r\nan end; and Miss Nightingale, regarding him as the indispensable man,\r\nlooked upon the end of his viceroyalty as an event almost comparable to\r\nthe death of Sidney Herbert. The same error must not be made a second\r\ntime. Before Sir John Lawrence retired, the mainspring of the machinery\r\nfor sanitary progress in India must be inserted. Miss Nightingale had a\r\nclear policy in her mind, and she secured most of her points with a\r\ncelerity and a completeness which entitle this episode to rank among her\r\nmost brilliant campaigns. It will make the moves more easily\r\nintelligible if the main points are indicated at once. What Miss\r\nNightingale sought to attain was an efficient machine which would turn\r\nout sanitary improvement in accordance with the best knowledge of the\r\nday and of which the working would be subject to the propelling force of\r\npublic opinion. She, therefore, set herself to secure, if by any means\r\nshe could, (1) an executive sanitary authority in India, (2) an expert\r\ncontrolling (and, incidentally, an inspiring) authority in London, and\r\n(3) the publication of an annual report on the work done, so as to make\r\nboth parts of the machinery amenable to public inspection.\r\n\r\nOn the first of these points, Miss Nightingale was doomed to some\r\ndisappointment. Neither at the time with which we are here concerned,\r\nnor in her later years, nor yet to the present day, has any supreme and\r\nexecutive sanitary machinery been established in India. \"It was true,\"\r\nsaid the Secretary of State during a debate in the House of Lords on\r\nIndian sanitation in 1913 (June 9), \"that the present system fell very\r\nfar short of a great independent Sanitary Department supreme over the\r\nProvincial Governments and forming one of the main departments of the\r\nGovernment of India.\" That was Miss Nightingale's ideal at this time,\r\nthough in later years, as we shall learn,[90] she recognized that\r\nsanitary progress in India could not be turned out by clockwork; but\r\nat the opposite pole stood the scheme by which she was threatened in\r\n1867 for consigning sanitary administration in the Local Governments to\r\na sub-head of the prison department. She had the satisfaction before Sir\r\nJohn Lawrence left India of seeing another scheme adopted, which was at\r\nany rate as far removed from the Prison as from her Ideal. On the other\r\ntwo points, stated above, she was at the time completely successful.\r\nShe had in all this a valuable ally; and it was her way to see something\r\nlike special providence in fortunate circumstances. The most logical\r\nmind sometimes admits exceptions; yet there was in fact no exception.\r\nProvidence, according to her belief, is Law; and it had become a law\r\nthat men interested in her interests should go to her. Hence it was that\r\nshe made at this time a friendship with one whose disinterested devotion\r\nto the cause of sanitary reform in India equalled her own, and whose\r\nco-operation was to prove of the greatest value. The new friend was Sir\r\nBartle Frere.\r\n\r\n  [90] See below, p. 405.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nFor a year and more the question of the Public Health Service in India\r\nhad slumbered, so far as organization was concerned. Sir John Lawrence's\r\ndispatch had been lost at the India Office for some months (p. 109).\r\nThen, when it had been found and Miss Nightingale had drafted the reply,\r\nLord de Grey had gone out of office before the reply could be sent\r\n(p. 110). She had opened communications with his successor, Lord\r\nCranborne (p. 114); but his stay at the India Office was brief, for when\r\nDisraeli's Franchise Bill was introduced, he resigned. He was succeeded\r\nby Sir Stafford Northcote, with whom as yet Miss Nightingale had no\r\nacquaintance. She had been diligent in writing to Sir John Lawrence, who\r\ncontinued to ask her advice and send her papers; but she had held her\r\nhand on this side. The reason was that all her friends told her that\r\n\"the Tories would be out in a week.\" Dr. Sutherland, greatly daring,\r\nwent further and talked treason against Sir John Lawrence: \"He is our\r\nworst enemy,\" and \"we had better wait.\" Miss Nightingale ascribed this\r\nribaldry to a desire of Dr. Sutherland to be off cholera-hunting in the\r\nMediterranean, and reproached him in some impromptu rhymes.[91] Sir\r\nJohn Lawrence was her hero. If he did amiss sometimes (as she had to\r\nadmit), she put it down, I suppose, to his Council, with whom he was\r\nnotoriously not on good terms; whatever was done aright was his doing.\r\nAnd meanwhile the weeks passed and the Tories did not go out; they\r\nlooked, on the contrary, very much like staying in. Miss Nightingale\r\ndetermined to wait no longer. She announced her determination in a\r\nletter to Captain Galton (May 28, 1867). He was in touch with Indian\r\nsanitary business as a member of the War Office Sanitary Committee, to\r\nwhich such business was often referred, and she attached considerable\r\nweight to his judgment. \"Our Indian affairs,\" she wrote, \"are getting as\r\ndrunk as they can be\"; she was resolved to have them put straight. She\r\nhad been \"strongly advised to communicate direct with Sir Stafford\r\nNorthcote\"; advised, I imagine, by Mr. Jowett (for was not Sir Stafford\r\na Balliol man, and therefore specially amenable to reason?) What did\r\nCaptain Galton advise? He agreed that things were not going well, and\r\nwas glad that she meant to move. He would give her an introduction, if\r\nshe liked, to Sir Stafford, and he advised her to see Sir Bartle Frere,\r\n\"as I fancy you could make him useful.\" He had just returned from the\r\ngovernorship of Bombay, and had been given a seat on the India Council\r\nin London. A fortnight later (June 14) he and Miss Nightingale met:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Captain Galton._) 35 SOUTH STREET, _June_ 16\r\n     [1867]. I have seen Sir Bartle Frere. He came on Friday by his own\r\n     appointment. And we had a great talk. He impressed me\r\n     wonderfully--more than any Indian I have ever seen except Sir John\r\n     Lawrence; and I seemed to learn more in an hour from him upon\r\n     Indian administration and the way it is going than I did from Ellis\r\n     in six months, or from Strachey in two days, or from Indian\r\n     Councils (Secretaries of State and Royal Commissions and all) in\r\n     six years. I hope Sir B. Frere will be of use to us. I have not yet\r\n     applied to you to put me into communication with Sir S. Northcote.\r\n     Because why? Your Committee won't sit. It won't sit on Monday\r\n     because Monday is Whit Monday. And Tuesday is Whit Tuesday. And\r\n     Wednesday is Ash Wednesday. And Thursday is Ascension Day. And\r\n     Friday is Good Friday. And Saturday is the Drawing Room. And Sunday\r\n     is Sunday. And that's the way that British business is done. Now\r\n     you are come back, you must send for the police and make the\r\n     Committee do something. As for Sutherland, I never see him. Malta\r\n     is the world. And Gibraltar is the \"next world.\" And India is that\r\n     little island in the Pacific like Honolulu.\r\n\r\n  [91] Free as air.\r\n       I don't care.\r\n       Go away\r\n       To Malta-y.\r\n       I don't care.\r\n       Let Sir John Hall\r\n       Be Director-Genera_ll_.\r\n\r\n       I don't care.\r\n       As for India-y\r\n       Let her have her way.\r\n       I don't care.\r\n       Free as air.\r\n       I don't care.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale must have impressed Sir Bartle Frere as greatly as he\r\nhad impressed her. He now became one of her constant visitors, and a\r\nbusy correspondence began between them. He and his family became friends\r\ntoo of Mr. and Mrs. Nightingale, whom they visited at Embley. \"There are\r\namongst his papers for 1867 and the five following years considerably\r\nmore than a hundred letters, short or long, from Miss Nightingale to\r\nhim, mostly upon sanitary questions affecting India.\"[92] The letters\r\nfrom him to her are not less numerous. \"I will make 35 South Street the\r\nIndia Office,\" he said, \"while this affair is pending.\" Miss Nightingale\r\ntook note of his conversations, principally for communication to Dr.\r\nSutherland, but also for her own guidance. But if she had much to learn\r\nfrom him, he also must have found something to learn, and some\r\ninspiration to derive, from her. The work which she had done for the\r\nRoyal Commission had given her a great knowledge of sanitary, or rather\r\ninsanitary, details in India; and on the principles of sanitation she\r\nwas an acknowledged expert. Her acquaintance with the official history\r\nof the Indian Public Health question was unique, for no other person had\r\nso continuously been in intimate touch with it. The clearness of her\r\nmind and her breadth of view impressed every one who saw her. And then\r\nsomething must be allowed, in considering her successive \"conquests\" (as\r\nMr. Jowett used playfully to call them), to the personal factor. The\r\nadministrators and ministers who sought or were invited to audience of\r\nher would have been more (or less) than men if they had not felt a\r\ncertain pleased curiosity in meeting this famous woman, who rose from an\r\ninvalid's bed to receive them. Each of them speedily discovered that her\r\nenthusiastic devotion to humanitarian causes was equalled by her\r\nsoundness of judgment, and that remarkable powers of brain were\r\naccompanied by all of a woman's graciousness \"She is a noble-minded\r\nwoman,\" said Mr. Lowe of her, \"and so charming.\"\r\n\r\n  [92] _Life of Sir Bartle Frere_, vol. ii. pp. 38, 39.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by Sir Bartle Frere's sympathy, Miss Nightingale set to work\r\nin earnest. The first thing was to obtain a colourable starting-point.\r\nThis she found in some Indian papers, sent to her by friends on the War\r\nOffice Sanitary Committee, on the question of \"Doors _versus_ Windows.\"\r\nShe determined to attack simultaneously the Governor-General and the\r\nSecretary of State on this question. To the Governor-General she wrote\r\nimmediately; but with regard to the India Office there was a preliminary\r\ndifficulty. \"Dr. Sutherland is so very etiquettish,\" she wrote to\r\nCaptain Galton (June 24, 1867), \"that he says, But how are you to have\r\nseen these papers? I don't know. It seems to me that the cat has been\r\nout of the bag so long that it is no use tying the strings now. I will\r\nsay, if you like, that Broadhead of Sheffield gave me £15 to steal them\r\nand to blow you up.[93] I am going ahead anyhow.\" Captain Galton put\r\naside Dr. Sutherland's etiquette. It had been an established practice\r\nfor years, he said, as every official person knew, to send Indian\r\nsanitary papers to Miss Nightingale; and in the very improbable event of\r\nanybody objecting in this case, he, Captain Galton, would assume full\r\nresponsibility. Miss Nightingale then proceeded to draw up an\r\nindictment, and to suggest reform, basing her case upon the \"Doors\r\n_versus_ Windows\" papers. Upon the merits of the controversy I am\r\nhappily not called upon to offer an opinion. To Miss Nightingale and the\r\nWar Office Sanitary Committee the ventilation of barracks or hospitals\r\nby open doors was a pestilential heresy; to the Government of India it\r\nwas the ark of the covenant for salvation in hot weather. Sir John\r\nLawrence in reply to Miss Nightingale's remonstrance told her bluntly\r\nthat nothing but an imperative order from home would make him close the\r\ndoors, and even then that he would first send the most energetic\r\nprotest. But, though she attached some importance to the matter on its\r\nmerits, her real object was something different. She objected to the\r\nmanner in which the case had been handled. The sanitary experts at home\r\nhad said that new barracks and hospitals should be ventilated by open\r\nwindows, and their report to that effect had been sent to India. Then\r\nthe matter had been referred in succession to the Government of India,\r\nthe local governments, sanitary commissions, medical authorities,\r\nmilitary authorities, district authorities, and then to the Government\r\nof India again. Next it had come back to London, where the experts were\r\nstill of their original opinion. There seemed no reason why the travels\r\nof the \"Doors and Windows\" papers should ever come to an end. If every\r\nsanitary question were to be treated in the same way, no sanitary\r\nprogress could be made; and the idea of \"sanitary administration by\r\nuniversal suffrage\" was impossible. Sir John Lawrence hardly made proper\r\nallowance for her way of putting things when he assured her in reply\r\nthat she was mistaken in thinking that such matters were referred to a\r\nvote in India. The case showed conclusively, it seemed to her, that the\r\ntime had come for organizing the health service on a business-like\r\nfooting. She suggested schemes on the basis of the Three Points already\r\ndefined--a Sanitary Department in India to do the work; a Sanitary\r\nDepartment at the India Office to control the work; and annual\r\npublication of what work had been done. With regard to the second point,\r\nshe regarded the War-Office-cum-India-Office Sanitary Committee as only\r\na makeshift, as we have seen.[94] She knew whom she wanted at the head\r\nof a separate India Office Sanitary Department. \"If only,\" she had\r\nwritten to Captain Galton (July 24), \"we could get a Public Health\r\nDepartment in the India Office to ourselves with Sir B. Frere at the\r\nhead of it, our fortunes would be made.\"\r\n\r\n  [93] For William Broadhead and the rattening outrages at Sheffield, see\r\n       M^cCarthy's _History of our own Times_, vol. iv. p. 156.\r\n\r\n  [94] Above, p. 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nSuch was the substance of successive letters which Miss Nightingale now\r\nsent to the Secretary of State. The first of them is an admirable\r\ndocument; closely reasoned; with a pleasant pungency of phrasing here\r\nand there, such as might occur in a despatch by Lord Salisbury; with a\r\ntouch of emotion kept well in reserve. She begged the minister to go\r\nback to the point at which the matter had been left when Lord de Grey\r\nwent out, and \"to put the Indian Health Service once for all on a\r\nsatisfactory footing. This would indeed be a noble service for a\r\nSecretary of State to render to India.\" She submitted her letter to Sir\r\nBartle Frere, who pronounced it excellent. He carried it off, and\r\ndelivered it to the minister in person. This was on July 27. On July 30\r\nSir Stafford Northcote answered, promising early attention to the\r\nsubject, and adding, \"I attach great weight to any suggestions from one\r\nwho is so well qualified to speak with authority as yourself.\" Without\r\ngoing into the question, he made the general remark that \"due regard\r\nshould be had to local information.\" This criticism was just what she\r\nwanted; it afforded an opening for unfolding her schemes in greater\r\ndetail. Sir Stafford Northcote must have been impressed by the letters;\r\nfor he gave the matter immediate study, and then, on August 19, wrote to\r\nknow if he might call for \"a little conversation.\" Miss Nightingale told\r\nMr. Jowett of this new opening. \"I am delighted to hear,\" he wrote (Aug.\r\n20), \"that you are casting your toils about Sir Stafford Northcote. Do\r\nyou know that he was elected a scholar of Balliol with A. H. Clough? I\r\nthink that you may do him as well as the cause immense service. May I\r\ntalk to you as I would to one of our undergraduates? Take care not to\r\nexaggerate to him (I mention this because it is really difficult to\r\navoid when you are deeply interested). You will make him feel, I have no\r\ndoubt, that you can really help him. Of course he will have heard things\r\nsaid against you by the officials; and you will have to produce just the\r\nopposite impression to these reports. But I don't really suppose that\r\nthe art of influencing others can be reduced to rules. I commend you and\r\nyour work to God, and am quite sure that 'it will be given you what to\r\nsay,' because (I am afraid this is very rationalistic) you know what you\r\nmean to say.\" The interview (Aug. 20), somewhat dreaded on Miss\r\nNightingale's side, had already taken place when Mr. Jowett's letter\r\ncame. \"Much more satisfactory to my hopes,\" she wrote to Sir Bartle\r\nFrere (Aug. 21) \"than I expected. I think you have imbued him with your\r\nviews on Indian administration more than you know. We went as fully\r\ninto the whole subject as was possible in an hour, seeing that India is\r\nrather a big place.\" Her notes of the conversation show that she had\r\nfound the minister very keen and sympathetic. \"I don't know,\" she told\r\nDr. Sutherland, \"that he saw how afraid I was of him. For he kept his\r\neyes tight shut all the time. And I kept mine wide open.\" Afraid or not,\r\nshe had done a great stroke of business:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Captain Galton._) 35 SOUTH STREET, _August_\r\n     22 [1867]. I saw Sir S. Northcote on Tuesday. He came of his own\r\n     accord--which I think I partly owe to you. The result is (that is,\r\n     if he does as he says) that there will be a Controlling Committee\r\n     at the India Office for sanitary things with Sir B. Frere at the\r\n     head and Sir H. Anderson at the tail, and your War Office\r\n     Commission as the consulting body. As to the Public Health Service,\r\n     I told him that we want the Executive Machinery in India to do it,\r\n     and the Controlling Machinery at the I.O. to know that it is being\r\n     done. The work of the Controlling Committee will really be\r\n     introducing the elements of civilization into India. Sir S. N. said\r\n     something about having Gen. Baker and Sir E. Perry on as members\r\n     and an assistant-secretary to Sir H. Anderson. (I wish I could\r\n     choose the members as I did in Sidney Herbert's time.) But I have\r\n     the greatest faith in Sir B. Frere, and he asked me to let him\r\n     bring Sir H. Anderson here; so we shall have the Chairman and the\r\n     Secretary on our side. I liked Sir S. Northcote; but he appears to\r\n     me to have much the same calibre of mind as Lord de Grey. He has\r\n     none of the rapid, unerring perception of Sidney Herbert; none of\r\n     the power of Sir J. Lawrence; none of the power and keenness of Sir\r\n     B. Frere. He talks about \"talking it all over with Lord Clinton.\"\r\n     Do you know Lord Clinton, and does he know anything about it? But\r\n     my principal reason for writing to you now is this: I went as fully\r\n     as I could with Sir S. N. into this, that no time should be lost in\r\n     sending R. Engineers intended for service in India to examine and\r\n     make themselves acquainted with improvements in sewerage, drainage,\r\n     water-supply of towns, and in application of sewage to agriculture,\r\n     and with improvements in Barrack and Hospital construction, etc.,\r\n     as carried out here. Now, there is no one but you who can properly\r\n     advise Sir S. N. in this way. Pray do so.\r\n\r\nSir Stafford Northcote did all, and more than all, that at this\r\ninterview he had promised. She was impressed by his sincerity at the\r\ntime. \"I believe,\" she told Dr. Sutherland, \"he will carry out exactly\r\nwhat he consents to do.\" But other friends advised her to leave nothing\r\nto good intentions, to strike while the iron was hot, and to continue\r\njogging the minister's elbow until the things were actually done.\r\nPresently an occasion offered itself. The Governor-General had written\r\nher a long private letter about the ravages of cholera among the troops\r\nin the N.W. Provinces. She sent the substance of this letter to Sir\r\nStafford Northcote, and invited him to concur in her opinion that such\r\nthings ought not to be. But could they ever be prevented until the\r\nPublic Health Service was placed on a proper footing? The minister, in\r\nacknowledging her letter (Oct. 18), said that, the pressure of other\r\nbusiness being relaxed, he was now able to give full attention to\r\nsanitary questions, and that he would like to have another conversation.\r\nThe interview was on October 23. On this occasion the minister came\r\nfull-handed. He told her, first, as appears from her notes and letters,\r\nthat he had definitely decided to appoint a Sanitary Committee at the\r\nIndia Office. He read out the list of names; with Sir Bartle Frere,\r\naccording to promise, as chairman, and Sir H. Anderson as secretary. He\r\nthen asked her advice with regard to the relations between this\r\nCommittee and the War Office Sanitary Committee, for there was, as he\r\nexplained (and as she knew only too well), great jealousy between the\r\ntwo offices. She advised that the India Office Committee should be the\r\ncontrolling and responsible body, and the War Office Committee\r\nconsultative only; \"but I shall be much surprised,\" she wrote in\r\nexplaining things to Captain Galton, \"if Sir Bartle Frere does not refer\r\nmany more matters to you than has previously been the case.\" She had\r\nthus won the second of her Three Points.\r\n\r\nThe minister next handed to Miss Nightingale a dispatch dated August 16,\r\nwhich he had received from the Government of India, and to which an\r\nimmediate answer was requested. This was not news to her (though she was\r\ndoubtless too discreet to say so), for the Governor-General had also\r\nwritten to her on August 16 to like effect. In this dispatch the\r\nappointment of medical officers in each Local Government for the\r\nexclusive duty of Principal Health Officers, paid by the Central\r\nGovernment, was suggested. The Secretary of State left the dispatch with\r\nMiss Nightingale, and requested her to favour him in writing with her\r\nviews on the whole subject, suggesting, if she cared to do so, what\r\nanswer should be sent to the Government of India. The new proposal of\r\nSir John Lawrence's Government was not all or exactly what she wanted.\r\nThe local Officers of Health would be advisory only; and the\r\nCommissioner with the Government of India would remain in a like\r\nposition. What she had wanted was a distinct Executive Department, both\r\ncentral and local, for Public Health. Still, the appointment of State\r\nOfficers of Health was a step in the right direction, and a great\r\nadvance on the Prisons scheme. She must see to it that the better\r\nopinion was made to prevail, while Sir John Lawrence was still at the\r\nhelm in India and the Secretary of State in London was friendly to her.\r\nThe new policy would win some part of her First Point. It remained to\r\nsecure Annual Health Reports; and the Secretary of State had given her\r\nan opening by inviting her to make suggestions at large.\r\n\r\nShe had now a spell of very hard work. At the end of it she had sent to\r\nSir Stafford Northcote (1) a draft for immediate reply to the Indian\r\nGovernment, approving the appointment of the Health Officers. This was\r\nsent to India on November 29. (2) Secondly, a digest of the Indian\r\nSanitary Question from 1859 to 1867. This was printed in a Blue-book\r\nissued by the Secretary of State in 1868. (3) Thirdly, a memorandum on\r\nthe whole subject full of suggestions and advice. This was sent out to\r\nthe Indian Government, and printed in the same Blue-book. It was printed\r\nanonymously, though there are tell-tale phrases (such as \"The result\r\nwill be the civilization of India\"); the manuscript of the \"review,\" in\r\nMiss Nightingale's hand, is amongst her papers. (4) Fourthly, and\r\nprincipally, the heads of a dispatch on the whole subject which, she\r\nsuggested, might be sent to the Government of India. \"Of course I cannot\r\nsay,\" she wrote, \"how far these heads may meet with your concurrence.\"\r\nThe heads, in her hand, are also amongst her papers, and a comparison of\r\nthis manuscript with Sir Stafford Northcote's dispatch of April 23,\r\n1868, shows that they all met with his concurrence; they were adopted\r\nfor the most part in her own words. The suggestions of this dispatch\r\nconstitute one of Miss Nightingale's best services to the cause of\r\nPublic Health in India. It begins with calling for a Report on Sanitary\r\nProgress. It then reverts to the famous \"Suggestions in regard to\r\nSanitary Works\" of 1864, which Miss Nightingale had so large a hand in\r\nwriting (above, p. 48). \"I consider these Suggestions,\" wrote the\r\nSecretary of State, \"to be of very great practical value and to\r\nconstitute a good foundation for sanitary inquiry and work in India.\"\r\nThe dispatch invites particular attention to some of the Suggestions\r\nseriatim, and calls for a report on any progress that has been made in\r\ncarrying them out. It also includes Miss Nightingale's later suggestion\r\n(above, p. 152) that Engineer Officers should be sent to England to\r\nstudy sanitary questions. The whole dispatch, whilst leaving full\r\nexecutive authority to the Government of India, was directed to\r\nstimulating its zeal in the cause of Public Health.\r\n\r\nThe adoption by Sir Stafford Northcote of Miss Nightingale's \"heads\" for\r\nthis dispatch secured the last of her Three Points. The reports for\r\nwhich the minister called were duly forwarded. They were printed in the\r\nBlue-book above mentioned, together with the other Papers, and with the\r\ndispatch itself. This Blue-book[95] was the first of an Annual Series of\r\nIndian Sanitary Reports. So, then, Miss Nightingale's intercourse with\r\nSir Stafford Northcote had, with the limitations already explained,\r\nsecured all her points.\r\n\r\n  [95] For its title, etc., see Bibliography A, No. 52.\r\n\r\n\"I hope, in this recourse to Sir Stafford Northcote,\" she had written\r\nthree months before,[96] \"as a last hope. Hope was green, and the donkey\r\nate it (that's me).\" \"I am inclined to think,\" Mr. Jowett had written to\r\nher at the same time (July 18), \"that you have really made a\r\nconsiderable step. I talked about Sir Stafford Northcote to some people\r\nwho know him. They say, besides what I told you, that he works really\r\nhard at Indian affairs. Now, you must get hold of him and fuse him and\r\nSir Bartle Frere and Sir John Lawrence into one by some alchemy or\r\nwicked wit of woman, and then something will be accomplished.\" And this\r\nwas what had now been made possible; though perhaps the only secret on\r\nthe woman's part was the combination of singleness of purpose, fulness\r\nof knowledge, clearness of insight, and a resolute will.\r\n\r\n  [96] To Captain Galton (July 16).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nSir Stafford Northcote's dispatch, and the accompanying memorandum, did\r\nnot immediately have the effect which Miss Nightingale hoped so far as\r\nthe Supreme Government was concerned. The Government of India somewhat\r\nresented the process of hustling by the India Office at home. Miss\r\nNightingale had kept her faith in Sir John Lawrence, but it was put to\r\nsome severe trials. For some time she had been more ready to praise and\r\npray than he to do her bidding:--\r\n\r\n     (_Sir John Lawrence to Miss Nightingale._) CALCUTTA, _Feb._ 7\r\n     [1867]. Many thanks for your very kind note of the 26th of\r\n     December. I am quite sure that I in no wise deserve your blessings;\r\n     nevertheless I am grateful to you for them, perhaps the more so\r\n     when I bear in mind my own demerits. It is not a very pleasant duty\r\n     talking to the \"Kings of the East,\" for though they receive all\r\n     which one in my position may say with gravity and politeness, it\r\n     makes but a wretched impression on them. You will be glad to hear\r\n     that the death-rate among the English troops in India for 1866 was\r\n     only 20.11, while it was 24.24 in 1865. This seems to me a very\r\n     satisfactory result.... I have had an envoy down in Calcutta for\r\n     some time, from the King of Bokhara, asking for aid against Russia.\r\n     How strange it will be if Russia and England meet in Central Asia!\r\n     I hope, if it is to be so, that it will be in amity. There is ample\r\n     verge and room enough for both powers; and if both would only see\r\n     this we might be a help instead of an injury to each other.\r\n\r\n     (_Sir John Lawrence to Miss Nightingale._) SIMLEH, _July_ 9\r\n     [1867].... [A passage dwelling on the many difficulties he had to\r\n     encounter.] I do what I can to further the objects to which you\r\n     have devoted your life--no doubt with slow and faltering steps, but\r\n     still as fast as circumstances will permit.\r\n\r\nThen on August 16 the Governor-General sent her a letter which must have\r\nvery seriously shaken her faith. He had asked her (p. 55) to formulate\r\na scheme for female nursing. With her habitual good sense, she had\r\ncontemplated an experiment in a single hospital and had drawn up a\r\nscheme on that basis. Instead of accepting her basis, the\r\nGovernor-General referred the matter to his medical advisers, who\r\nelaborated a scheme for introducing female nursing into seven hospitals.\r\nThe cost of this larger scheme was prohibitive; and the Government of\r\nIndia, instead of falling back upon Miss Nightingale's proposals, vetoed\r\nthe whole thing. Sir John McNeill, who had assisted her with her\r\nproposals, was very angry, and sent her a hot indictment of the Indian\r\nofficials. \"You must wait for a new Governor-General. Sir John Lawrence\r\nhas greatly disappointed me.\" Then, afraid, I suppose, lest she might\r\nadopt some of his scathing phrases in replying to Sir John Lawrence, he\r\nwrote again, suggesting that dignified silence would be the better\r\ncourse. \"It would be mere waste of time and hardly consistent with your\r\nname and position to argue with men who flounder about in such a\r\nhopeless slough of unreason. I would not even point out their\r\ninconsistencies. Both the Governor-General and you are high powers, and\r\nyour correspondence ought, I think, to be conducted with the reserve\r\nthat is proper to such persons when your opinions do not coincide. I\r\nwould merely say, etc. etc.\" What Sir John McNeill suggested she adopted\r\nwith some slight modifications. In her reply to the Governor-General\r\n(Sept. 26, 1867) she thanked him for his letter and for the documents he\r\nenclosed; explained that she had submitted a scheme only because he had\r\nasked her to do so; remarked that the scheme which the Government of\r\nIndia had vetoed was not hers, nor anything like it; and added that if\r\nat any future time the question should be revived, she would again be\r\nwilling, if desired, to give any advice or assistance in her power.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nThis incident did not interfere with the continuance of frequent and\r\nfriendly correspondence between the two \"high powers,\" and Miss\r\nNightingale's persistence may not have been without some effect.\r\nShe frequently sent sanitary papers and suggestions to the\r\nGovernor-General, and these he always referred to some appropriate\r\nofficial for report, whose remarks (sometimes in manuscript, sometimes\r\nprinted for official use) were in turn forwarded to her. There is one\r\nlong printed paper of the kind, headed \"Dr. Farquhar's Notes on Miss\r\nNightingale's Questions relative to Sanitation in Algeria and India,\r\nApril 20, 1867.\"[97] Miss Nightingale forwarded the \"Notes\" to Sir\r\nBartle Frere, who wrote a long memorandum in rejoinder. He agreed with\r\nMiss Nightingale that there was no reason why India should not be\r\nbrought up to the Algerian standard. The \"Notes\" were a compendium, he\r\nthought, of the errors that impede sanitary reform in India. But though\r\nSir John Lawrence's officials were critical, and her suggestions were\r\nnot at the moment effectual, they may have had their influence in the\r\nend. Sir Bartle Frere was once asked by a member of Miss Nightingale's\r\nfamily to what her influence in India was due, and what had set the\r\nsanitary crusade in motion? Not the big Blue-book, he replied, which\r\nnobody reads, but \"a certain little red book of hers on India which made\r\nsome of us very savage at the time, but did us all immense good.\"[98]\r\nSir Bartle Frere had by no means lost faith in Sir John Lawrence, and\r\nurged Miss Nightingale to write to him, telling him in advance of the\r\nMemorandum which would shortly come to him from the India Office. \"I\r\nhave often known,\" he said, \"a scrap of paper on which you had written a\r\nfew words--or even your words printed--work miraculously.\" The scrap of\r\npaper was sent, urging Sir John Lawrence once more to appoint an\r\nExecutive Sanitary Department in the Government of India, but it did not\r\nprevail:--\r\n\r\n     (_Sir John Lawrence to Miss Nightingale._) _October_ 25 [1868]. It\r\n     may seem to you, with your great earnestness and singleness of\r\n     mind, that we are doing very little, and yet in truth I already see\r\n     great improvement, more particularly in our military cantonments,\r\n     and doubtless we shall from year to year do better. But the\r\n     extension of sanitation throughout the country and among the\r\n     people must be a matter of time, especially if we wish to carry\r\n     them with us ... (_November_ 23). I think that we have done all we\r\n     can do at present in furtherance of sanitary improvement, and that\r\n     the best plan is to leave the Local Governments to themselves to\r\n     work out their own arrangements. If we take this course we shall\r\n     keep them in good humour. If we try more we shall have trouble. I\r\n     don't think we require a commission. Mr. John Strachey, a member of\r\n     Council, has special charge of the Home Department under the\r\n     Government of India, and all sanitary matters have been transferred\r\n     to that department, so that when I am gone there will still be a\r\n     friend at court to whom you can refer.\r\n\r\n  [97] She had made use, after all, it will be observed, of Dr.\r\n       Sutherland's visit to \"Astley's\" (above, p. 110).\r\n\r\n  [98] The \"little red book\" was the reprint of Miss Nightingale's\r\n       _Observations_; see above, p. 36.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale found cold comfort in this promised friend at court,\r\nfor Sir John Lawrence forwarded at the same time a letter to himself\r\nfrom Mr. Strachey, in which the latter expressed himself in indignant\r\nterms about the India Office's memorandum. It was full, he complained,\r\nof things which they were said to have left undone, and gave them no\r\ncredit for what they had done; and it advocated a forward policy in\r\nsanitation which might be attended by grave dangers in forcing sanitary\r\nreform upon unwilling people. \"Well,\" said Miss Nightingale to Dr.\r\nSutherland, \"this is the nastiest pill we have had, but we have\r\nswallowed a good many and we're not poisoned yet.\" They replied to\r\nMr. Strachey's criticisms in a final letter to the Governor-General. An\r\n\"admirable\" letter, Sir Bartle Frere thought it; \"my letter to Sir J.\r\nL.,\" wrote Miss Nightingale in her diary, \"to bless and to curse\" (Dec.\r\n4, 1868). I hope, and I expect, that the blessing was the larger half.\r\nFor, in truth, she had obtained during Sir John Lawrence's term of\r\noffice at least as much for her cause as could reasonably be expected.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir John Lawrence returned to London, one of the first things he\r\ndid was to call at South Street, and leave, with a little note, \"a small\r\nshawl of the fine hair of the Thibet goat.\" He did not presume, he said,\r\nto ask to see her without an appointment, but would call another day if\r\nshe cared to give him one. Three days later (April 3, 1869), he came,\r\nand all Miss Nightingale's admiration returned on the instant. She made\r\na long note of his conversation, which ranged over the whole field of\r\nIndian government. On the subject of Public Health she recorded with\r\npleasure his saying to her: \"You initiated the reform which initiated\r\nPublic Opinion which made things possible, and now there is not a\r\nstation in India where there is not something doing.\" But \"in the first\r\nplace,\" she wrote, \"when I see him again, I see that there is nobody\r\nlike him. He is Rameses II. of Egypt. All the Ministers are rats and\r\nweasels by his side.\" And to a friend she afterwards said:[99] \"Peace\r\nhath higher tests of manhood than battle ever knew. He has left his mark\r\non India. Wherever superstition or ignorance or starvation or dirt or\r\nfever or famine, or the wild bold lawlessness of brave races, or the\r\ncringing slavishness of clever feeble races was to be found, there he\r\nhas left his mark. He has set India on a new track which--may his\r\nsuccessors follow!--\r\n\r\n                       Knight of a better era\r\n                       Without reproach or fear,\r\n                       Said I not well that Bayards\r\n                       And Sidneys still are here!\"\r\n\r\n  [99] Letter to Madame Mohl, March 26, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                    PUBLIC HEALTH MISSIONARY FOR INDIA\r\n\r\n                                (1868-1872)\r\n\r\n\r\n     There is a vast work going on in India, and the fruits will be\r\n     reaped in time. Not all at once. We must go on working in faith and\r\n     in hope.--DR. JOHN SUTHERLAND (_Letter to Miss Nightingale_, August\r\n     16, 1871).\r\n\r\n\"By dint of remaining here for 13 months to dog the Minister I have got\r\na little (not tart, but) Department all to myself, called 'Of Public\r\nHealth, Civil and Military, for India,' with Sir B. Frere at the head of\r\nit. And I had the immense satisfaction 3 or 4 months ago of seeing\r\n'Printed Despatch No. 1' of said Department. (I never, in all my life\r\nbefore, saw any Despatch, Paper or Minute under at least No. 77,981).\r\nStill you know this is not the meat, but only the smell of the meat.\r\nWhat we want is an Executive out there to do it, and a Department here\r\nto see that it is being done. The latter we now have; the former must\r\nstill rest with the Viceroy and Council out there.\" Thus did Miss\r\nNightingale, in a letter to M. Mohl (Feb. 16, 1868), sum up the results\r\nof the campaign described in the last chapter. Her life, for some years\r\nto come, was now largely occupied with the affairs of the \"little\r\nDepartment all to herself.\" The Department may have been little, but she\r\ninterpreted her duties, as we shall see, in a large sense. Her work in\r\nconnection with the War Office, though it did not entirely cease, was no\r\nlonger absorbing. She had ceased to have direct communications with the\r\nSecretaries for War. In 1868 there was one of the periodical\r\nreorganizations of the War Office, followed in the succeeding year by\r\nthe retirement of Captain Galton.[100] She had thus no longer a\r\nconfidential intimate in the Department. She could have made one,\r\nperhaps, if she had so desired; for her Scutari friend, Sir Henry\r\nStorks, had now been appointed to the newly organized post of\r\nController-in-Chief, and presently became Surveyor-General of Ordnance.\r\nBut her Indian preoccupations, coupled with the never-ceasing strain of\r\nwork as Adviser-in-General on Hospitals and Nursing, used all her\r\nstrength. In the present chapter we shall follow the course of her life\r\nduring the years 1868-72, with special reference to Indian work; in the\r\nnext, we shall follow the development of her work in connection with\r\nhospitals and nursing.\r\n\r\n  [100] He retired at the end of 1869, and was appointed to a post in the\r\n        Office of Works. Miss Nightingale intervened (through\r\n        representations to Lord de Grey and Mr. Cardwell) to secure his\r\n        continuance as a member of the Army Sanitary Committee.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe long strain, mentioned in the letter to M. Mohl, had told severely\r\nupon Miss Nightingale's strength, and at the end of December 1867 she\r\nwent, leaving no address behind (except with Dr. Sutherland), for a\r\nmonth's rest-cure under Dr. Walter Johnson at Malvern. Upon her return\r\nto London she was busily engaged in the preparation of the Indian\r\n\"Memorandum\" described in the last chapter. The death of Miss Agnes\r\nJones and the anxieties which it entailed (chap. i.) told greatly upon\r\nher health and spirits. Mr. Jowett, after seeing her early in July, was\r\nseriously alarmed at her state of physical weakness and mental\r\ndespondency. She had half promised him that she would go for rest and\r\nchange to Lea Hurst; but only if the rest were accompanied by a duty of\r\naffection. If her mother were at Lea Hurst, she would go; if not, she\r\nwould not. So Mr. Jowett wrote privately to Mrs. Nightingale, who\r\narranged her plans accordingly, and begged her daughter to come and be\r\nwith her. They were together at the old home for three months (July\r\n7-Oct. 3), and for a week of the time Mr. Jowett was with them. The\r\nmother and the daughter had seldom been on such affectionate and\r\nunderstanding terms as now. \"Mama,\" wrote Miss Nightingale to Madame\r\nMohl (July 20), \"is more cheerful, more gentle than I ever remember\r\nher.\" The daughter's note of conversations shows that they talked of\r\nmisunderstandings in the past, and that the mother was ready to blame\r\nherself: \"You would have done nothing in life, if you had not resisted\r\nme.\" For many years to come, Miss Nightingale repeated such visits to\r\nthe country homes of her parents. They were now old; her father was 74\r\nin 1868, her mother 80. The daughter desired to be with them so far as\r\nher work allowed. Perhaps something was due also to the persistent\r\ncounsels of Mr. Jowett. Continuous drudgery in London was not good, he\r\npleaded, either for her body or for her soul. They were supposed to have\r\nentered into a compact not to overwork. He avowed that he was faithfully\r\nkeeping his side of the bargain, and put her upon her honour to do her\r\npart in return. It was an unhealthy life, he pleaded, to be shut up all\r\nthe year in a London room. There was still much for her to do, and she\r\nwould do it all the better for some relaxation of daily effort. Perhaps\r\nhe persuaded her. At any rate, from 1868 for some years onwards there\r\nwas more of the country in Miss Nightingale's life--less of incessant\r\ndrudgery, more leisure for reading, more marge for meditation. In 1869\r\nshe was at Embley for three months in the summer; in 1870, at Embley for\r\none month, and at Lea Hurst for three; in 1871, there was a similar\r\ndivision of time; in 1872 she was at Embley for eight months.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nMr. Jowett was often a visitor on these occasions for a few days at a\r\ntime. He continued in frequent letters to urge her to attempt some\r\nsustained writing. She had a talent for it, he insisted, and she was\r\npossessed of great influence. He suggested as a subject suitable to her\r\na Treatise on the Reform of the Poor Law, and he sent her a memorandum\r\nof his own ideas on the subject. There are one or two of Mr. Jowett's\r\nideas, and occasionally a phrase of his, in what she ultimately wrote.\r\nShe endeavoured to take his advice, and a resolve is recorded in her\r\ndiary for 1868 to devote an hour a day to writing. The projected work\r\nwent to no further length than that of a magazine article entitled \"A\r\nNote on Pauperism.\" Nothing that she ever wrote--with one\r\nexception[101]--cost her so much worry and trouble. She did what is\r\nalways trying to an author's equanimity and often prejudicial to the\r\neffect of his work: she admitted collaboration. Dr. Sutherland had a\r\nhand in it--that goes without saying, and his assistance was always\r\nuseful: he knew exactly within what limits he could really help his\r\nfriend. But her brother-in-law was an authority on the subject and Lady\r\nVerney claimed (and not without justice) to be an authority on the style\r\nappropriate to magazine articles. She took much well-meant trouble, and\r\ntranscribed her sister's first draft in her own hand, with corrections\r\nof her own also. The authoress was in despair, and sent again for Dr.\r\nSutherland: \"I have adopted _all_ your corrections, and _all_ Parthe's,\r\nand _all_ Sir Harry's; and they have taken out all my _bons mots_ and\r\nleft unfinished sentences on every page; and this _kind_ of work really\r\ntakes a year's strength out of me; and now you _must_ help me.\" So, Dr.\r\nSutherland patched up the broken sentences and harmonized the\r\ncorrections, and the article was ready. Miss Nightingale was as timid\r\nand perplexed as any literary beginner about placing her paper. After\r\nmuch consultation she decided to submit it to Mr. Froude, with whom as\r\nyet she had no acquaintance. She was as pleased as any literary beginner\r\nwhen the editor replied immediately that he would be delighted to print\r\nthe paper in his next number. In _Fraser_ for March 1869 it appeared\r\naccordingly--the first of several contributions which she made to that\r\nmagazine. The \"Note\" is somewhat disconnected in style and slight in\r\ntreatment, but is full of far-reaching suggestions. She begins by\r\ninsisting on a reform of which we have heard much in a previous chapter:\r\nthe separation of the sick and incapable from the workhouse. Then she\r\ngoes on to argue that the thing to do is \"not to punish the hungry for\r\nbeing hungry, but to teach the hungry to feed themselves.\" She attacks\r\nthe _laisser faire_ school of economists, \"which being interpreted means\r\nLet bad alone.\" Political economy speaks of labour as mobile, and she\r\nquotes a leading article in the _Times_ which had talked about \"the\r\nconvenience in the possession of a vast industrial army, ready for any\r\nwork, and chargeable on the public when its work is no longer wanted.\"\r\nShe stigmatizes such talk as false, in the first case, and wicked, in\r\nthe second. The State should endeavour to facilitate the organization of\r\nlabour. \"Where work is in one place, and labour in another, it should\r\nbring them together.\" Education should be more manual, and less\r\nliterary. Pauper children should be boarded out and sent to industrial\r\nschools. The condition of the dwellings of the poor is at the root of\r\nmuch pauperism, and the State should remedy it. There should be\r\nState-aided colonization, so as to bring the landless man to the manless\r\nlands. Some of all this was not so familiar in 1869 as it is to-day, and\r\nMiss Nightingale's \"Note\" attracted much attention. Among those who read\r\nit with hearty approval was Carlyle. \"Last night,\" wrote Mr. Rawlinson\r\n(March 11), \"I spent several hours with Mr. Carlyle, and amongst talk\r\nabout Lancashire Public Works, modern modes of government, modern\r\nPolitical Economy and Social Morality, he brought to my notice your\r\n'Note on Pauperism' as in his opinion the best, because the most\r\npractical, paper he had read of late on the question. I wish you could\r\nhave been present to have listened to the great man alternately pouring\r\nforth a living stream of information, and then bursting into a rhapsody\r\nof passionate denunciation of some thick-headed blundering statesmanship\r\nor indignant tirade against commercial rascality.\" Dr. Sutherland called\r\nto express his pleasure that the article had gone off so well. \"Well!\"\r\nshe said; \"it's not well at all. The whole of London is calling here to\r\ntell me they have got a depauperizing experiment, including that horrid\r\nwoman.\" A large bundle of correspondence testifies to the interest which\r\nher paper aroused. Some of it was not disinterested. All the emigration\r\nsocieties read the paper with the gratitude which looks to\r\nsubscriptions. The article was very expensive to her; for she gave away\r\nthe editor's fee many times over in such contributions. For some years\r\nfollowing, she took great interest in schemes for emigration, and\r\nnothing angered her more in the politics of the day than the absence of\r\nany Colonial Policy in the schemes and speeches of Liberal Ministers.\r\n\r\n  [101] See below, p. 196.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale had sent some of her correspondence on colonization to\r\nan old friend at the Colonial Office--Sir Frederick Rogers (Lord\r\nBlachford). \"See what a thing,\" he replied (July 26, 1869), \"is a bad\r\nconscience! You, conscious of a life spent in bullying harmless\r\nGovernment offices, think that I must read your (beautiful) handwriting\r\nwith horror. Whereas I, conscious of rectitude, have sincere pleasure in\r\nreceiving your assaults.\" This was a preface to an essay in which the\r\nUnder-Secretary demonstrated, in the manner habitual to the Colonial\r\nOffice in those days, the utter undesirability, impropriety, and\r\nimpossibility of doing anything at all. Lord Houghton raised a\r\nconversation on the subject in the House of Lords, but confessed to Miss\r\nNightingale that he was half-hearted, and nothing came of it. She formed\r\na large heap of newspaper cuttings, collected facts from foreign\r\ncountries, made many notes, and intended to follow up the suggestions,\r\nthrown out in her paper, into greater detail, and then perhaps to\r\npublish a book. She gave much time during 1869 to the subject, and in\r\nDecember Mr. Goschen, the President of the Poor Law Board, came to see\r\nher. They had a long discussion, and her note of it begins with an\r\n_aperçu_ of the Minister--a little severe, perhaps, but not\r\nundiscriminating. \"He is a man of considerable mind, great power of\r\ngetting up statistical information and political economy, but with no\r\npractical insight or strength of character. It is an awkward mind--like\r\na pudding in lumps. He is like a man who has been senior wrangler and\r\nnever anything afterwards.\" He seemed to Miss Nightingale to see so many\r\nobjections to any course as to make him likely to do nothing; and his\r\neconomic doctrines paid too little regard, she thought, to the actual\r\nfacts. \"You must sometimes trample on the toes of Political Economists,\"\r\nshe said,[102] \"just to make them feel whether they are standing on firm\r\nground.\" That she was deeply interested in the whole subject is shown by\r\na testamentary document, dated September 19, 1869, in which she\r\nearnestly begged Dr. Sutherland to edit and publish her further \"Notes\r\non Pauperism.\"[103] She lived in full possession of her faculties for at\r\nleast a quarter of a century after this date, but she never put the\r\nNotes into printable shape. As I have said before, she lacked\r\ninclination to sustained literary composition. Besides, her hands were\r\nfull of other things.\r\n\r\n  [102] In a letter to Madame Mohl, March 26, 1869.\r\n\r\n  [103] In the same document Dr. Sutherland is begged to do the like for\r\n        her (1) _Notes on Lying-in Hospitals_ (published in 1871; see\r\n        below, p. 196), and (2) \"Paper on selling lands with houses in\r\n        towns\" (see above, p. 92). At a later time she sent the second\r\n        batch of Pauperism Notes to Dr. Sutherland; but he was of opinion\r\n        that they required complete rewriting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's main work during these years may be described as that\r\nof a Health Missionary for India. She carried on her mission in three\r\nways. She endeavoured by personal interviews and correspondence to\r\nincense with a desire for sanitary improvement all Indian officials,\r\nfrom Governors-General to local officers of health, whom she could\r\ncontrive to influence. She made acquaintance with natives of India and\r\nstrove to spread her gospel among them in their own country. And through\r\nher \"own little Department\" in co-operation with Sir Bartle Frere she\r\ndid a large amount of official work in the same direction.\r\n\r\nOn her return to London at the beginning of October 1868, she found work\r\nawaiting her under the first of the foregoing heads. Sir John Lawrence's\r\nterm of office of Governor-General was coming to an end, and Disraeli\r\nhad appointed Lord Mayo to succeed him. On October 22 he wrote asking to\r\nbe allowed to see Miss Nightingale before he sailed for India:--\r\n\r\n     (_Sir Bartle Frere to Miss Nightingale._) INDIA OFFICE, _Oct._ 23\r\n     [1868]. I think you will hear from Lord Mayo, who I know is anxious\r\n     to see you, if you can grant him an interview next week. Could you\r\n     in the meantime note down for him, as you did (when describing what\r\n     the folk in India should now do) in a note to me a few weeks ago,\r\n     the points to which he should give attention? I think you will like\r\n     him very much. In appearance he is a refined likeness of what I\r\n     remember of O'Connell when I went as a boy (with a proper horror of\r\n     his principles) to hear him before he got into Parliament. Lord\r\n     Mayo is very pleasing in manner, with no assumption of \"knowing all\r\n     about it,\" and evidently better informed on many subjects\r\n     connected with sanitary reform than many men of greater pretension.\r\n     He has a great sense of humour, too, which is a great help. I wish,\r\n     when you see him, you would ask to see Lady Mayo.\r\n\r\nThe interview with Lord Mayo was on the 28th, and a few days later Miss\r\nNightingale saw Lady Mayo also. On the morning of the 28th Dr.\r\nSutherland was summoned to South Street. He was in a hurry and hoped\r\nthere was \"nothing much on to-day.\" \"There is a 'something,'\" ran the\r\nmessage sent down to him, \"which most people would think a very big\r\nthing indeed. And that is seeing the Viceroy or Sacred Animal of India.\r\nI made him go to Shoeburyness yesterday and come to me this afternoon,\r\nbecause I could not see him unless you give me some kind of general idea\r\nwhat to state.\" Dr. Sutherland, thus prettily flattered, stayed, and\r\nthey discussed what should be said to the Sacred Animal. Next day she\r\nreported the conversation to Dr. Sutherland:--\r\n\r\n     What he said was not unsensible but essentially Irish. He said that\r\n     he should see Sir J. Lawrence for two days before he (Sir J. L.)\r\n     left. And he said he should ask Sir J. L. to call upon me the\r\n     moment he returned, and to ask _me_ to write out to _him_ (Lord\r\n     Mayo) anything that Sir J. L. thought \"a new broom\" could do. That\r\n     was clever of him. But he asked me (over and over again) that I\r\n     should now at once before he goes write down for him something (he\r\n     said) \"that would guide me upon the sanitary administration as soon\r\n     as I arrive.\" And \"especially (he said) about that Executive.\" He\r\n     asked most sagacious questions about all the men.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale took counsel with Sir Bartle Frere and Dr. Sutherland\r\nand then wrote a Memorandum for the new Viceroy. She covered the whole\r\nground of sanitary improvement, dwelling much on questions of irrigation\r\nand agricultural development as aids thereto. \"A noble and a most\r\ncomplete Paper,\" said Sir Bartle Frere (Nov. 1), \"and it will be\r\ninvaluable to India.\" Perhaps it impressed the new Viceroy also. At any\r\nrate Lord Mayo's administration was marked by some improvement in\r\nsanitary conditions, and by extension of irrigation works.[104] He also\r\ninitiated two of the indispensable preliminaries to sanitary progress:\r\nthe Census, and a statistical survey of the country. In an\r\nautobiographical note detailing her relations with successive Viceroys,\r\nMiss Nightingale says that Lord Mayo's policy in sanitary and\r\nagricultural matters was in accord with lines which Sir Bartle Frere and\r\nshe desired. \"I say nothing,\" she adds, \"of his splendid services in\r\nforeign policy, in his Feudatory States and Native Chiefs policy, in\r\nwhich doubtless Sir B. Frere helped him. I saw him more than once before\r\nhe started, and he corresponded with me all the time of his too brief\r\nViceroyalty. I think he was the most open man, except Sidney Herbert, I\r\never knew. I think it was Lord Stanley who said of him, 'He did things\r\nnot from calculation, but from the nature of his mind.' Lord Mayo said\r\nhimself that his Irish experience with 'a subject race' was so useful to\r\nhim in India. He said that he was certainly the only Viceroy who had\r\nsold his own cattle in the market.\" \"Florence the First, Empress of\r\nScavengers, Queen of Nurses, Reverend Mother Superior of the British\r\nArmy, Governess of the Governor of India\" was Mr. Jowett's address when\r\nhe heard of the interviews with Lord Mayo. \"Empress of Scavengers\" was\r\nM. Mohl's title for her at this time. \"Rather,\" she said, \"Maid of all\r\n(dirty) work; or, The Nuisances Removal Act: that's me.\"\r\n\r\n  [104] For the former point, see the Annual Sanitary Reports; for a\r\n        summary of the latter works, see Sir William Hunter's _Earl of\r\n        Mayo_, pp. 177-8.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's greatest ally in India at this time was, however,\r\nLord Napier, Governor of Madras. \"I remember Scutari,\" he wrote (June\r\n24, 1868), \"and I am one of the few original faithful left, and I think\r\nI am attached to you irrespective of sanitation.\" He was firm in her\r\ncause even where Sir John Lawrence had seemed unfaithful. The\r\nGovernor-General had abandoned a scheme for female nursing (p. 157);\r\nLord Napier carried one through in Madras, and corresponded at some\r\nlength with Miss Nightingale on the subject. Sir John Lawrence had\r\nrefused her advice to send some Engineer Officers home to study sanitary\r\nworks; he had \"none to spare.\" Lord Napier adopted the advice, and sent\r\nCaptain H. Tulloch, whose visit to England and association with\r\nMr. Rawlinson resulted in reports on urban drainage and the utilization\r\nof sewage. Lady Napier gave letters of introduction to Miss Nightingale\r\nto other officials from Madras, and Lord Napier reported progress to her\r\nconstantly:--\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Napier to Miss Nightingale._) KODAIKANAL, _Sept._ 22 [1867].\r\n     I write to you from one of the Arsenals of Health in Southern\r\n     India, from the Palni Hills, the most romantic and least visited of\r\n     these salubrious and beautiful places.... I have deferred writing\r\n     to you till I could announce that some sanitary good had really\r\n     been secured worthy of your attention. I cannot say that such is\r\n     yet the case, but something has been proposed and designed. We are\r\n     building central jails to empty the district jails, and we are\r\n     remodelling the district jails and rebuilding two or three. We are\r\n     aerating and enlarging the lock-ups. I have stirred up the doctors\r\n     in the general hospital at Madras. I have proposed to take the\r\n     soldiers out of it and build them a new separate military Hospital\r\n     (not yet sanctioned). I have endeavoured to raise the little native\r\n     dispensaries and hospitals out of their sordid baseness and\r\n     poverty. I am trying to get a new female hospital sanctioned for\r\n     women, both European and native, with respectable diseases, and the\r\n     others taken out and settled apart. I don't think my action has\r\n     gone beyond a kind of impulse and movement. But we may effect\r\n     something more important in the coming year. My wife has taken an\r\n     active interest in the Magdalen Hospital, the Lying-in Hospital,\r\n     and the orphanages of various kinds. We want money, zeal, belief;\r\n     and knowledge in many quarters.\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Napier to Miss Nightingale._) MADRAS, _Sept._ 3 [1868]. I am\r\n     truly happy to find that I can do something to please you and that\r\n     you will count me as a humble but devoted member of the Sanitary\r\n     band, of _your_ band I might more properly say! Do you know that I\r\n     was sent by Lord Stratford to salute and welcome you on your first\r\n     arrival at Scutari and that I found you stretched on the sofa where\r\n     I believe you never lay down again? I thought _then_ that it would\r\n     be a great happiness to serve you, and if the Elchi would have\r\n     given me to you I would have done so with all my heart and learned\r\n     many things that would have been useful to me now. But the Elchi\r\n     would never employ any one on serious work who was at all near\r\n     himself, so I spent the best years of my life at a momentous crisis\r\n     doing nothing when there was enough for all! But if I can do\r\n     something now it will be a late compensation ... [report on various\r\n     sanitary measures then in hand]. I have read the beautiful account\r\n     of \"Una\" last evening driving along the melancholy shore. I send it\r\n     to Lady Napier, who is in the Hills. I will write again soon, as\r\n     you permit and even desire it, and I am ever your faithful,\r\n     grateful and devoted Servant, NAPIER.\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Napier to Miss Nightingale._) MADRAS, _June_ 3 [1869]. ...\r\n     Now I have a good piece of news for you. We are framing a Bill for\r\n     a general scheme of local taxation in this Presidency, both in\r\n     municipalities and in villages, and the open country, to provide\r\n     for three purposes--local roads, primary education, and\r\n     Sanitation--such as improvement of wells, regulation of pilgrimages\r\n     and fairs, drainage, &c. It will be very unpopular I fear in the\r\n     first instance, for the people wish neither to be taught nor cured,\r\n     but I think it is better on the whole to force their hands. We are\r\n     driven to it, for I see clearly that we must wait a long time for\r\n     help from the Supreme Government.... I was pleased and flattered to\r\n     be mentioned by you in the same sentence with Lord Herbert. Indeed\r\n     I am not worthy to tie the latchet of his shoe, but there are\r\n     weaknesses and illusions which endure to the last, and I suppose I\r\n     never shall be indifferent to see myself praised by a woman and\r\n     placed in connection, however remote, with a person of so much\r\n     virtue and distinction. You shall have the little labour that is\r\n     left in me.[105]\r\n\r\n  [105] The other day in a bookseller's catalogue of \"Association Books\" I\r\n        found this item: \"Florence Nightingale's _Notes on Lying-in\r\n        Institutions_. Presentation copy, with autograph inscription, 'To\r\n        His Excellency the Lord Napier, Madras, this little book, though on\r\n        a most unsavoury subject, yet one which, entering into His\r\n        Excellency's plans for the good of those under his enlightened\r\n        rule, is not foreign to his thoughts--is offered by Florence\r\n        Nightingale, London, Oct. 10, '71.'\"\r\n\r\nA subject on which Miss Nightingale wrote both to Lord Napier and to\r\nLord Mayo was the inquiry into cholera in India ordered by the Secretary\r\nof State in April 1869. She had made the proposition many months before.\r\nIndian medical officers were absorbed in propounding theories; Miss\r\nNightingale wanted first an exhaustive inquiry into the facts. Even if\r\nsuch an inquiry did not establish any of the rival theories, it must\r\nlead, she thought, to much sanitary improvement. Sir Bartle Frere\r\nstrongly supported the idea, and it was arranged that the War Office\r\nSanitary Committee should make the suggestion and elaborate the scheme\r\nof procedure to be followed in India. The Committee meant for such a\r\npurpose Dr. Sutherland, and Dr. Sutherland meant in part Miss\r\nNightingale. Sir Bartle Frere constantly wrote to her to know when the\r\nIndia Office might expect the Instructions, and Miss Nightingale as\r\nconstantly applied the spur to Dr. Sutherland. On April 3 she delivered\r\nan ultimatum: \"Unless the Cholera Instructions are sent to me to-day, I\r\nrenounce work and go away.\" At last they arrived, and her friend\r\nreceived a withering note: \"_April_ 13, 1869. I beg leave to remark that\r\nI found a letter of yours this morning dated early in Dec., which I mean\r\nto show you, in which, with the strongest objurgations of me, you told\r\nme that you could not come because you intended to get the Cholera\r\nInstructions through by _December_ 12, 1868. My dear soul, really Sir B.\r\nFrere could not have known the exhausting labour he has put you all to;\r\nto produce that in four months must prove fatal to all your\r\nconstitutions! He is an ogre.\" Dr. Sutherland's Instructions are\r\nadmirably exhaustive, and may well have taken some time to prepare. The\r\nremaining stages of the affair were quick, and the Secretary of State's\r\ndispatch went out to the Government of India on April 23, followed by\r\nprivate letters from Miss Nightingale. The Sanitary Blue-books of\r\nsuccessive years contain copious reports and discussions upon this\r\n\"Special Cholera Inquiry.\" It furnished much material for scientific\r\ndiscussion, by which Miss Nightingale sometimes feared that what she\r\nregarded as the essence of the matter was in danger of being overlaid.\r\nShe and the Army Sanitary Committee took occasion more than once to\r\npoint out that \"whatever may be the origin of cholera, or whatever may\r\nultimately be found to be its laws of movement, there is nothing in any\r\nof the papers except what strengthens the evidence for the intimate\r\nrelation which all previous experience has shown to exist between the\r\nintensity and fatality of cholera in any locality and the sanitary\r\ncondition of the population inhabiting it.\"[106] The origin of cholera\r\nis now said to be a micro-organism identified by Koch, but the laws of\r\nits movement and activity remain inscrutable. Meanwhile, all subsequent\r\nexperience has confirmed the doctrine which Miss Nightingale continually\r\npreached, that the one protection against cholera consists in a standing\r\ncondition of good sanitation.\r\n\r\n  [106] Blue-book, 1870-71, p. 5; and see Bibliography A, No. 127.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nAt the very time when Dr. Sutherland was hard at work upon the Cholera\r\nInstructions, Miss Nightingale heard a report (on good authority) which\r\nfilled her with anger and consternation. Mr. Gladstone was engaged in\r\ncutting down the Army Estimates; the Army Medical Service was believed\r\nto be marked for retrenchment, and the War Office Sanitary Commission\r\nfor destruction. When she told this to Dr. Sutherland, he took the\r\nmatter with nonchalance and said (as men are sometimes apt to say in\r\nsuch cases, especially if there is a woman to rely upon) that he did not\r\nsee that anything could be done. Very different was the view taken by\r\nMiss Nightingale, when she contemplated, not merely the interruption of\r\nDr. Sutherland's useful work,[107] but the possibility of all Sidney\r\nHerbert's work being undermined. Nothing to be done indeed! There was\r\neverything to be done! She could write to the Prime Minister himself.\r\nShe could write to Lord de Grey (Lord President). She could get this\r\nfriend to approach one Minister, and that friend to approach another.\r\nShe could even claim a slight acquaintance, and write to Mr. Cardwell\r\n(Secretary for War). She could write to all her friends among the\r\nOpposition and give them timely notice of the wicked things intended by\r\ntheir adversaries. She ultimately wrote to Lord de Grey, enclosing a\r\nletter which he was to hand or not, at his discretion, to Mr. Cardwell.\r\nThe intervention was successful, and Lord de Grey asked her for\r\nMemoranda to \"post him up\" in the work of the Army Sanitary Commission\r\nand in the Sanitary Progress in India. Lord de Grey interceded with\r\nMr. Cardwell also on behalf of the Army Medical School and it was\r\nspared. The Army Sanitary Committee was not touched, and for nearly\r\ntwenty years more (till 1888) Dr. Sutherland continued his work upon it.\r\nMiss Nightingale's reports submitted to Lord de Grey are summarized in\r\na letter to M. Mohl (Nov. 21, 1869):--\"I am all in the arithmetical\r\nline now. Lately I have been making up our Returns in a popular form for\r\none of the Cabinet Ministers (we are obliged to be very 'popular' for\r\nthem--but hush! my abject respect for Cabinet Ministers prevails). I\r\nfind that every year, taken upon the last four years for which we have\r\nreturns (1864-7), there are, in the Home Army, 729 men alive every year\r\nwho would have been dead but for Sidney Herbert's measures, and 5184 men\r\nalways on active duty who would have been 'constantly sick' in bed. In\r\nIndia the difference is still more striking. Taken on the last two\r\nyears, the death-rate of Bombay (civil, military and native) is lower\r\nthan that of London, the healthiest city of Europe. And the death-rate\r\nof Calcutta is lower than that of Liverpool or Manchester![108] But this\r\nis not the greatest victory. The Municipal Commissioner of Bombay\r\nwrites[109] that the 'huddled native masses clamorously invoke the aid\r\nof the Health Department' if but one death from cholera or small-pox\r\noccurs; whereas formerly half of them might be swept away and the other\r\nhalf think it all right. Now they attribute these deaths to dirty foul\r\nwater and the like, and openly declare them preventable. No hope for\r\nfuture civilization among the 'masses' like this!\"\r\n\r\n  [107] Captain Galton took occasion in 1876 to render a tribute to\r\n        Dr. Sutherland's services. \"Possessed of high general culture, of\r\n        remarkably acute perception, of a very wide experience, and of a\r\n        perfectly balanced judgment, he has been the moving mind in the\r\n        proceedings of the Army Sanitary Commission since its formation.\"\r\n        (_Journal of the Society of Arts_, vol. xxiv. p. 520).\r\n\r\n  [108] According to the Sanitary Blue-book for 1869-70, the death-rates\r\n        per 1000 were: Bombay 19.2, London 23.3, Calcutta 31.9, Liverpool\r\n        36.4. In 1910 the order was very different: London 12.7,\r\n        Liverpool 17.7, Calcutta 23.0, Bombay 35.7. In four years (1864-8)\r\n        the death-rate in Bombay had fallen from 31.3 to 19.2; the rise in\r\n        modern times is due to the industrialization of the town.\r\n\r\n  [109] To Miss Nightingale; in the Blue-book (p. 186) it is similarly\r\n        stated that \"in three years the masses have begun to learn that\r\n        such scourges as cholera, fever and the like can be prevented by\r\n        the ordinary processes of sanitation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nIn December 1869 Miss Nightingale made a new friend. Lord Napier of\r\nMagdala[110] was passing through London, and wrote to Sir Bartle Frere\r\nsaying that it \"would make him very happy if he could have the privilege\r\nof paying his respects to Miss Nightingale before he left.\" Sir Bartle\r\nbegged Miss Nightingale to grant the favour, as Lord Napier was devoted\r\nto their cause and was likely to be employed in India again--as quickly\r\ncame to pass, for in the following month he was appointed\r\nCommander-in-Chief.[111] Lord Napier called on December 14, in order (as\r\nhe wrote to her in making the appointment) \"to have an opportunity of\r\nsaying how much I have felt indebted to you for the assistance that your\r\nprecepts and example gave to all who have been concerned with the care\r\nof soldiers and their families.\" He spent some hours with her, and she\r\nwas charmed with him. \"I felt sure,\" wrote Sir Bartle Frere (Dec. 23),\r\n\"that you would like Lord Napier of Magdala. He always seemed to me one\r\nof the few men fit for the Round Table.\" A long note which she recorded\r\nof the conversation shows how congenial it must have been to her, for\r\nLord Napier talked with strong feeling of the importance and the\r\npracticability of improving the moral health of the British soldier. The\r\nadministrators and the men of action always appealed to her more than\r\nthe politicians, and Lord Napier of Magdala was now added to her\r\nlist of heroes. \"When I look at these three men (tho' strangely\r\ndifferent[112])--Lord Lawrence, Lord Napier of Magdala and Sir Bartle\r\nFrere--for practical ability, for statesmanlike perception of where the\r\ntruth lies and what is to be done and who is to do it, for high aim, for\r\nnoble disinterestedness, I feel that there is not a Minister we have in\r\nEngland fit to tie their shoes--since Sidney Herbert. There is a\r\nsimplicity, a largeness of view and character about these three men, as\r\nabout Sidney Herbert, that does not exist in the present Ministers. They\r\nare party men; these three are statesmen. S. Herbert made enemies by\r\nnot being a party man; it gave him such an advantage over them.\" Lord\r\nNapier of Magdala came to see Miss Nightingale again in the following\r\nyear (March 18, 1870), spending in conversation with her his last hours\r\nbefore leaving London to take up his appointment in India. She and Sir\r\nBartle Frere attached high importance to this interview. Lord Napier was\r\na convinced sanitarian. He was bent upon introducing many reforms in the\r\ntreatment of the soldiers. He believed in the possibility of improving\r\nboth their moral and physical condition, by means of rational recreation\r\nand suitable employment. Sir Bartle Frere suggested to Miss Nightingale\r\nthat after seeing the Commander-in-Chief she should write to the Viceroy\r\nso as to prepare his mind for what Lord Napier would propose. Lord\r\nNapier himself begged her to do so. \"Everything in India,\" he said to\r\nher, \"depends on what is thought in England, and it was you who raised\r\npublic opinion in England on these subjects.\" Preparation of the\r\nViceroy's mind was held to be the more necessary because a letter,\r\nlately received by Miss Nightingale from him, seemed to show that his\r\nsanitary education was by no means complete. So Mr. Jowett's \"Governess\r\nof the Governors of India\" took her pupil again by the hand, and, with\r\nDr. Sutherland's assistance, drew up a further Memorandum on the Indian\r\nsanitary question at large. Referring him to the Royal Commission's\r\nReport, she pointed out that the causes of ill-health among the troops\r\nwere many, and that there was no single panacea; that if other causes\r\nwere not concurrently removed, the erection of new barracks could not\r\nsuffice; that fever may lurk beneath and around \"costly palaces\" (for so\r\nLord Mayo had called some of the new barracks) even as around hovels;\r\nthat expense incurred in all-round sanitary improvement can never be\r\ncostly in the sense of extravagant, because it is essentially saving and\r\nreproductive expenditure; and so forth, and so forth.[113] Miss\r\nNightingale, before sending her letter, submitted it to Sir Bartle Frere\r\n(March 25). \"I have nothing to suggest,\" he said, \"in the way of\r\nalteration, and only wish that its words of wisdom were in print, and\r\nthat thousands besides Lord Mayo could profit by them. They are in fact\r\nexactly what we want to have said to every one connected with the\r\nquestion from the Viceroy down to the Village Elder.\" Sir Bartle begged\r\nher to consider whether she could not write something to the same effect\r\nwhich would reach the latter class. Mr. Jowett had suggested something\r\nof the sort a few years before. \"Did it ever occur to you,\" he had\r\nwritten (March 1867), \"that you might write a short pamphlet or tract\r\nfor the natives in India and get it translated? That would be a curious\r\nand interesting thing to do. When I saw the other day the account of\r\nMiss Carpenter in India, I felt half sorry that it was not you. They\r\nwould have worshipped you like a divinity. A pretty reason! you will\r\nsay. But then you might have gently rebuked the adoring natives as St.\r\nPaul did on a similar occasion, and assured them that you were only a\r\nWasherwoman and not a Divine at all; that would have had an excellent\r\neffect.\" Presently she found an opportunity of doing something in the\r\nkind that Mr. Jowett and Sir Bartle Frere had suggested.\r\n\r\n  [110] Robert Cornelius Napier (1810-90), created Baron Napier of\r\n        Magdala, 1868. Miss Nightingale's other friend, the Governor of\r\n        Madras, Baron Napier (in the Scottish peerage), was created Baron\r\n        Ettrick in the United Kingdom peerage, 1872. In first signing\r\n        himself \"Napier and Ettrick\" in a letter to Miss Nightingale, he\r\n        begged \"the high priestess of irrigation\" to observe that his new\r\n        title was \"watery.\"\r\n\r\n  [111] In succession to Sir William Mansfield (Lord Sandhurst). On his\r\n        return from India Lord Sandhurst came to see Miss Nightingale\r\n        (July 8, 1870), and they corresponded afterwards.\r\n\r\n  [112] Of Lord Lawrence and Sir Bartle Frere, Miss Nightingale wrote to\r\n        Madame Mohl (March 26, 1869): \"You can ask Sir Bartle Frere about\r\n        Sir John Lawrence if you like. But they are so unlike, yet each so\r\n        roundly perfect in his own way, that they can never understand each\r\n        other--never touch at any point, not thro' eternity. I love and\r\n        admire them both with all my mind and with all my heart, but have\r\n        long since given up the slightest attempt to make either understand\r\n        the other. But each is too much of a man, too noble, too\r\n        chivalrous, to denigrate the other.\"\r\n\r\n  [113] The substance of much of her Memorandum to Lord Mayo was embodied\r\n        in the \"Observations\" which she contributed to the Indian Sanitary\r\n        Blue-book, 1869-70; see especially p. 43.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Lord Mayo had introduced Dr. J. W. Cunningham to Miss\r\nNightingale, and they became great allies. When he returned to resume\r\nhis duties as \"Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India,\" he\r\ncorresponded with Miss Nightingale regularly, telling her where things\r\nwere backward and where a word in season from her would be helpful. In\r\nevery question she took the keenest interest, sparing no pains to\r\nforward, so far as she could, every good scheme that was laid before\r\nher. In 1872 Mr. W. Clark, engineer to the municipality of Calcutta,\r\ncame to see her about great schemes of water-supply and drainage. She\r\nobtained an introduction to Sir George Campbell, the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nof Bengal, in order to commend to his notice Mr. Clark's plans. For many\r\nyears she was thus engaged in correspondence with sanitary reformers and\r\nofficials in various parts of India, sending them words of encouragement\r\nwhen they seemed to desire and deserve it, words of advice when, as was\r\nfrequently the case, they invited it. When such officials came home on\r\nfurlough, most of them came also to Miss Nightingale. Dr. Sutherland, in\r\nhis official capacity on the War Office Sanitary Committee, would often\r\nsee them first; he would then pass them on to her, dividing them into\r\ntwo classes: those \"whom you must simply lecture\" and those \"whose\r\neducation you had better conduct by innocently putting searching\r\nquestions to them.\" Miss Nightingale was never backward in filling the\r\npart of governess to those who in sanitary matters governed India.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nSanitary improvement depended, however, on the governed as well as on\r\nthe governors; and Miss Nightingale had for some time been extending her\r\ninfluence in India by making the personal acquaintance of Indian\r\ngentlemen. \"I have been quite beset by Parsees,\" she wrote to M. Mohl\r\n(Feb. 16, 1868); \"and after all I saw your Manochjee Cursetjee, that is,\r\nthe 'Byron of the East.' Sir B. Frere says that few men have done so\r\nmuch for the education of their own race. He talked a good deal of\r\nPhilosophy to me, while my head was entirely in Midwifery! He is (by his\r\nown proposal), if I can send out the Midwives, to take them in at the\r\nhouse of his daughters, of whom one married a Cama, and the other is the\r\nfirst Parsee lady who ever lived as an English single lady might do.\"\r\nMany other Indian ladies and gentlemen were introduced to Miss\r\nNightingale personally or in correspondence by Miss Carpenter. In 1870\r\nMiss Nightingale was elected an Honorary Member of the Bengal Social\r\nScience Association, the Council of which body was mainly composed of\r\nIndian gentlemen. She wrote a cordial letter of thanks (May 25). \"For\r\neleven years,\" she said, \"what little I could do for India, for the\r\nconditions on which the Eternal has made to depend the lives and healths\r\nand social happiness of men, as well Native as European, has been the\r\nconstant object of my thoughts by day and my thoughts by night.\" She\r\neulogized the work that had been done by many private gentlemen of\r\nIndia; she put before them a vision of vast schemes of drainage and\r\nirrigation; she sent a subscription to the funds of the Association, and\r\npromised a contribution to its Proceedings. In this contribution,[114]\r\nsent in June 1870, Miss Nightingale did what Sir Bartle Frere desired:\r\nshe addressed the Village Elder. \"I think,\" said Dr. Sutherland, who had\r\nsubmitted a draft for Miss Nightingale to rewrite in her own language,\r\n\"that this is the most important contribution you have made to the\r\nquestion.\" In simple and terse language, she described the sanitary\r\nreforms which might be carried out by the people themselves--pointing\r\nout in detail the nature of the evils, and the appropriate remedies for\r\nthem, and then appealing to simple motives for sanitary improvement. \"As\r\nwe find in all history and true fable that the meanest causes\r\nuniversally multiplied produce the greatest effects, let us not think it\r\nother than a fitting sacrifice to the Eternal and Perfect One to look\r\ninto the lowest habits of great peoples, in order, if we may, to awaken\r\nthem to a sense of the injury they are doing themselves and the good\r\nthey might do themselves. Much of the willingness for education is due\r\nto the fact, appreciated by them, that education makes money. But would\r\nnot the same appreciation, if enlightened, show them that loss of\r\nhealth, loss of strength, loss of life, is loss of money, the greatest\r\nloss of money we know? And we may truly say that every sanitary\r\nimprovement which saves health and life is worth its weight in gold.\"\r\nThis address to the Peoples of India was the most widely distributed of\r\nall Miss Nightingale's missionary efforts. The Association translated it\r\ninto Bengali. Sir Bartle Frere had it translated into other Indian\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n  [114] Bibliography A, No. 56.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VII\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's third sphere of missionary work was in the Sanitary\r\nDepartment at the India Office, to which, through her alliance with Sir\r\nBartle Frere, she was a confidential adviser. Her action, in making\r\nsuggestions and in seeking to influence officials in India, has been\r\nillustrated already. Her constant work was in helping to edit and in\r\ncontributing to the Annual Blue-book containing reports of \"measures\r\nadopted for sanitary improvements in India.\" The importance which Miss\r\nNightingale attached to the publication of such an annual has been\r\nexplained in general terms already (p. 145). She saw in it two useful\r\npurposes. First, the fact that reports from India were required and\r\npublished each year acted as a spur to the authorities in that country;\r\nand, secondly, the introductory memorandum, and the inclusion of reports\r\non Indian matters by the War Office Sanitary Committee, gave\r\nopportunity, year by year, for making suggestions and criticisms. The\r\nAnnual was issued by the Sanitary Department at the India Office and\r\nedited by Mr. C. C. Plowden, a zealous clerk in that office with whom\r\nMiss Nightingale made friends; Sir Bartle Frere, as head of the\r\nDepartment, instructed him to submit all the reports to Miss Nightingale\r\nwho in fact was assistant-editor, or perhaps rather (for her will seems\r\nto have been law) editor-in-chief. It was she who had prepared for the\r\nRoyal Commission the analysis of sanitary defects in the several Indian\r\nStations; who had written the \"Observations\" on them; who had taken a\r\nprincipal part in drafting the \"Suggestions\" for their reform. It was\r\nnatural that she should be asked to report on the measures actually\r\ntaken to that end. She was a very critical reporter. \"Sir Bartle Frere\r\nhesitates a little,\" she was told on one occasion (1869), \"as to the\r\nomission of all terms of praise, and says that the Indian Jupiter is a\r\ngod of sunshine as well as thunder and should dispense both; he,\r\nhowever, sanctions the omission in the present case.\" Miss Nightingale's\r\npapers show that during the years 1869-74 she devoted great labour to\r\nthe Annual. She read and criticised the abstracts of the local reports\r\nprepared by Mr. Plowden; she discussed all the points that they\r\nsuggested with Dr. Sutherland; she wrote, or suggested, the introductory\r\nmemorandum. She did this work with the greater zeal because it kept her\r\ninformed of every detail; and the knowledge thus acquired gave the\r\ngreater force to her private correspondence with Viceroys, Governors,\r\nCommanders-in-Chief, and Sanitary Commissioners. Her share in the first\r\nnumber of the Annual has been already described (p. 155). In the\r\nfollowing year Mr. Plowden wrote (May 22, 1869): \"I forward a sketch of\r\nthe Introductory Memorandum to the Sanitary volume. You will see that\r\nthe greater part of it is copied verbatim from a memorandum of your own\r\nthat Sir Bartle Frere handed over to me for this purpose.\" \"I can never\r\nthank you sufficiently,\" wrote Sir Bartle himself (July 5), \"for all the\r\nkind help you have given to Mr. Plowden's Annual, at the cost of an\r\namount of trouble to yourself which I hardly like to think of. But I\r\nfeel sure it will leave its mark on India.\" She took good care that it\r\nshould at any rate have a chance of doing so. She had discovered that\r\nthe 1868 Report, though sent to India in October of that year, had not\r\nbeen distributed in the several Presidencies till June 1869. She now saw\r\nto it that copies of the 1869 Report were sent separately to the various\r\nstations by book-post. She continued to contribute in one way or another\r\nto successive volumes[115]; and that for 1874 included a long and\r\nimportant paper by her.\r\n\r\n  [115] See Bibliography A, Nos. 57, 62.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VIII\r\n\r\nTen years before Miss Nightingale had popularized the Report of her\r\nRoyal Commission in a paper entitled \"How People may Live and Not Die in\r\nIndia.\" The Paper was read to the Social Science Congress in 1863. In\r\n1873 she was again requested to contribute a Paper to the Congress. She\r\nchose for her title \"How some People have Lived, and Not Died in India.\"\r\nIt was a summary in popular form of ten years' progress, and this was\r\nthe Paper which the India Office reprinted in its Blue-book of 1874.\r\nMiss Nightingale glanced in rapid detail at the improvements in various\r\nparts of India; took occasion to give credit to particularly zealous\r\nofficials; and noticed incidentally some of the common objections. One\r\nobjection was that caste prejudice must ever be an insuperable obstacle\r\nto sanitary improvement. She gave \"a curious and cheerful\" instance to\r\nthe contrary. Calcutta had \"found the fabled virtues of the Ganges in\r\nthe pure water-tap.\" When the water-supply was first introduced, the\r\nhigh-caste Hindoos still desired their water-carriers to bring them the\r\n_sacred_ water from the _river_; but these functionaries, finding it\r\nmuch easier to take the water from the new taps, just rubbed in a little\r\n(vulgar, not sacred) mud and presented it as Ganges water. When at last\r\nthe healthy fraud was discovered, public opinion, founded on experience,\r\nhad already gone too far to return to dirty water. And the new\r\nwater-supply was, at public meetings, adjudged to be \"theologically as\r\nwell as physically safe.\" Then there was the objection of expense, but\r\nshe analysed the result of sanitary improvements in statistics of the\r\narmy. The death-rate had been brought down from 69 per 1000 to 18. Only\r\n18 men died where 69 died before. A sum of £285,000 was the money saving\r\non recruits in a single year.\r\n\r\nThe course of sanitary improvement, and the results of it, among the\r\ncivil population cannot be brought to any such definite test; no Indian\r\ncensus was taken till 1872, registration of births and deaths was only\r\nbeginning and was very imperfect; and India is a country as large as the\r\nwhole of Europe (without Russia). It was the opinion of a competent\r\nauthority that the sanitary progress which had been made in India during\r\nthe years covered by Miss Nightingale's review \"had no parallel in the\r\nhistory of the world\";[116] but the progress was relative of course to\r\nthe almost incredibly insanitary condition of the country when she began\r\nher crusade. The progress had been made along many different lines.\r\nFirst, in connection with the health of military stations, the\r\nGovernment of India established committees of military, civil, medical\r\nand engineering officers, of local magistrates and village authorities\r\nto regulate the sanitary arrangements of the neighbourhood. Sanitary\r\noases for British troops were thus established in the midst of\r\ninsanitary deserts. Then, sanitary regulations were issued for fairs and\r\npilgrimages--each of these a focus of Indian disease. Institutions in\r\nIndia--hospitals, jails, asylums--had been greatly improved; and the\r\nmunicipalities of the great cities had made some sanitary progress. Ten\r\nyears before, Miss Nightingale had reported to the Royal Commission that\r\nno one of the seats of Presidencies in India had as yet arrived at the\r\ndegree of sanitary civilization shown in the worst parts of the worst\r\nEnglish towns. Now, Calcutta had a pure-water supply and the main\r\ndrainage of most of the town was complete. Bombay had done less by\r\nmunicipal action, but thanks to a specially vigorous Health Officer, Dr.\r\nHewlett, sanitation had been improved. Madras had improved its\r\nwater-supply and was successfully applying a part of its sewage to\r\nagriculture. The condition of the vast regions of rural India showed\r\nthat the teaching of the Sanitary Commissioners was beginning to take\r\nsome effect. Hollows and excavations near villages were being filled up;\r\nbrushwood and jungle, removed; wells, cleaned. Surface refuse was being\r\nremoved; and tanks were being provided for sewage, to prevent it going\r\ninto the drinking-tanks. From reports of particular places, Miss\r\nNightingale drew her favourite moral. There was a village in South India\r\nwhich had suffered very badly from cholera and fever. It was in a foul\r\nand wretched state, and had polluted water. Then wells were dug and\r\nproperly protected; the surface drainage was improved; cleanliness was\r\nenforced; trees were planted. The village escaped the next visitation of\r\nthe scourge. Miss Nightingale had many hours of depression, and many\r\noccasions of disappointment, as Health Missionary for India; but in her\r\nPaper of 1874 she bore \"emphatic witness how great are the sanitary\r\ndeeds already achieved, or in the course of being achieved, by the\r\ngallant Anglo-Indians, as formerly she bore emphatic witness against the\r\nthen existing neglects.\" Only the fringe of the evil had been touched;\r\nbut at any rate enough had been done to show that the old bogey, \"the\r\nhopeless Indian climate,\" might in course of time be laid by wise\r\nprecautions. \"There is a vast work going on in India,\" said Dr.\r\nSutherland; and in this work Miss Nightingale had throughout played a\r\nprincipal, and the inspiring, part. It was the opinion of an\r\nunprejudiced expert who, though he admired her devotion, did not always\r\nagree with her views or methods, that \"of the sanitary improvements in\r\nIndia three-fourths are due to Miss Nightingale.\"[117]\r\n\r\n  [116] Captain Galton, \"On Sanitary Progress in India,\" 1876 (_Journal of\r\n        the Society of Arts_, vol. xxiv. pp. 519-534.) This is the best\r\n        _short_ account of the matter that I have come across. It is more\r\n        detailed than Miss Nightingale's Paper of 1874. For further\r\n        particulars, a reader should, of course, refer to the Annual\r\n        Sanitary Blue-books.\r\n\r\n  [117] So Sir Bartle Frere reported to Miss Nightingale that Sir John\r\n        Strachey had said to him; and Sir John wrote in much the same sense\r\n        to Miss Nightingale herself.\r\n\r\nBut here, as in all things, her gaze was fixed upon the path to\r\nperfection. In her own mind she counted less the past advance than the\r\nfuture way. There was an Appendix to her Paper in which she preached the\r\nsupreme importance of Irrigation--of irrigation, that is, combined with\r\nscientific drainage. Only by that means, she held, could yet more people\r\n\"live and not die in India,\" and could the country be raised to its full\r\nproductive power. A letter which Sir Stafford Northcote sent her (April\r\n29, 1874), in acknowledgment of her Paper on \"Life or Death in India,\"\r\nexactly expressed her own feelings. \"How much,\" he said, \"you have done!\r\nand how little you think you have done! After all, the measure of our\r\nwork depends upon whether we take it by looking backwards or by looking\r\nforwards, by looking on what has been accomplished or on what has\r\nrevealed itself as still to be accomplished. When we have got to the top\r\nof the mountain, are we much nearer the stars or not?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                 ADVISER-GENERAL ON HOSPITALS AND NURSING\r\n\r\n                                (1868-1872)\r\n\r\n\r\n     We are your Soldiers, and we look for the approval of our\r\n     Chief.--MISS AGNES JONES (_Letter to Miss Nightingale_).\r\n\r\nFrom a correspondent in the North of England: \"I have got a colliery\r\nproprietor here to co-operate with the workmen to build a Hospital for\r\nAccidents. Will you kindly give your opinion on the best kind of\r\nbuilding?\" From a correspondent in London: \"We are proposing to form a\r\nBritish Nursing Association. May we ask for your advice and\r\nsuggestions?\" These letters are samples of hundreds which Miss\r\nNightingale received, and to all such applications she readily replied.\r\nShe constituted herself, or rather she was constituted by her\r\nfellow-countrymen, a Central Department for matters pertaining to\r\nhospitals and nurses.\r\n\r\nFrom all parts of the country, from British colonies and from some\r\nforeign countries, plans of proposed General Hospitals, Cottage\r\nHospitals, Convalescent Homes were submitted to her. She criticised them\r\ncarefully. When she was consulted at an earlier stage, she often\r\nsubmitted plans of her own. In all such cases, there were experts among\r\nher large circle of friends--architects, sanitary engineers, military\r\nengineers, hospital superintendents and matrons--to advise and assist\r\nher. And here a curiously interesting thing may be noticed. Miss\r\nNightingale had begun her work as a Reformer with the military\r\nhospitals. So high was now their standard that she often went to them\r\nfor models. Many plans for ideal hospitals were drawn for her at this\r\ntime by Lieutenant W. F. Ommamney, R.E., at the War Office. The\r\nimprovement of buildings and of nursing went on concurrently, and Miss\r\nNightingale used her influence in each department to improve the other.\r\nIf she were consulted only about buildings, she would answer: \"These\r\nplans are all very well, as far as they go; but your Hospital will never\r\nbe efficient without adequate provision for a supply of properly trained\r\nnurses.\" If she were asked to furnish a supply of nurses, she would say:\r\n\"By all means; but you must satisfy me first that your buildings are\r\nsanitary.\" Thus, when she was asked to send nurses to the Sydney\r\nInfirmary, she stipulated that plans of the buildings should be\r\nsubmitted; and when the War Office was negotiating for a supply of\r\nnurses for Netley, there was a voluminous correspondence about the\r\nimprovement of the wards and of the nurses' quarters.\r\n\r\nThere was a great extension during these years of societies for the\r\ntraining of nurses, and of the introduction of trained nurses into\r\ninfirmaries and other institutions. All this involved a large addition\r\nto Miss Nightingale's correspondence. As the nursing system extended,\r\nmany questions arose with regard to the relation between the medical and\r\nthe nursing staffs, and she was constantly referred to for suggestions\r\nand advice. She printed a code of \"Suggestions\" in 1868 dealing with\r\nsuch matters,[118] and three years later she and Dr. Sutherland drew up\r\na Code for Infirmary Nursing which was approved by Mr. Stansfeld, the\r\nPresident of the newly-formed Local Government Board. Her correspondence\r\nwas as extensive with individuals as with institutions. Hundreds of\r\ngirls who thought of becoming nurses applied to her, and she generally\r\nanswered their letters; but the supply of nurses barely kept pace with\r\nthe demand. Miss Nightingale was impressed in particular by the lack of\r\nsuitable applicants for the higher posts. There were many women anxious\r\nto take up nursing as a profession. There were few who possessed the\r\nsocial standing, the high character, trained intelligence, and personal\r\ndevotion which were necessary to make them successful Lady\r\nSuperintendents; and much of Miss Nightingale's correspondence during\r\nthese years was to friends in various parts of the country who were\r\nbegged to enlist promising recruits.\r\n\r\n  [118] Bibliography A, No. 49 (note).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nAmong the women who sought out Miss Nightingale for advice were Queens\r\nand Princesses. She guarded very jealously, however, the seclusion which\r\nwas necessary to enable her to do her chosen work, and she did not allow\r\nit to be invaded at will even by the most exalted personages. Her\r\nposition as a chronic invalid gave her the advantage. She could pick and\r\nchoose by feeling a little stronger or a little weaker. She made two\r\nrules which she communicated to her influential friends. She would not\r\nbe well enough to see any Queen or Princess who did not take a personal\r\nand practical interest in hospitals or nursing; and she would never be\r\nwell enough to receive any who did not come unattended by ladies or\r\nlords in waiting. Any interview must be entirely devoid of ceremonial;\r\nit must be simply between one woman interested in nursing and another.\r\nIn 1867 the Queen of Prussia was paying a visit to the English court,\r\nand Queen Victoria asked Miss Nightingale through Sir James Clark to see\r\nQueen Augusta. Miss Nightingale was assured that the Queen had given\r\nmuch personal attention to hospitals. Miss Nightingale saw her (July 6)\r\nand found that the assurances were well founded:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Julius Mohl._) 35 SOUTH STREET, _July_ 28\r\n     [1867]. I am a little unhappy because the Queen of Prussia's\r\n     Secretary told Mad. Mohl that I had seen the Queen. I liked her. I\r\n     don't think the mixture of pietism and absolutism is much more\r\n     attractive at the Court of Prussia than at the Court of Rome.\r\n     Still, I am always struck, especially with our own Royal family,\r\n     how superior they are in earnestness and education to other women.\r\n     I know no two girls of any class, of any country, who take so much\r\n     interest in things that are interesting, as the Crown Princess of\r\n     Prussia and Princess Alice of Darmstadt--especially in theological\r\n     matters and administration.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Holland, it will be remembered, had not been received; but\r\nat a later time Miss Nightingale saw her, in November 1868 and again in\r\nMarch 1870. \"I think of you,\" wrote Queen Sophie (March 29, 1870), \"as\r\none of the highest and best I have met in this world.\" The Princess\r\nAlice asked for an interview in 1867 through Lady Herbert, who was able\r\nto inform Miss Nightingale that \"the Princess has been to see most of\r\nthe hospitals in London with a view to learn all about them so as to\r\nimprove those in Darmstadt.\" Miss Nightingale saw the Princess in June,\r\nand in subsequent years there was much correspondence between them. But\r\nthe royal lady who made the greatest impression on Miss Nightingale was\r\nthe Crown Princess Victoria. It had been explained to Miss Nightingale\r\nby one of the Princess's ladies that \"H.R.H. has always thought a life\r\ndevoted to the comfort of fellow-beings and the alleviation of their\r\nsufferings the one most to be envied,\" and that \"she knows your Notes on\r\nHospitals and Notes on Nursing almost by heart.\" The Princess was in\r\nEngland at the end of 1868, and was full at the time of schemes for a\r\nnew hospital at Berlin, for lying-in hospitals, for a training-school\r\nfor nurses. She showed her practical purpose by sending to Miss\r\nNightingale in advance her architect's plans. They had two long\r\ninterviews in December, and Miss Nightingale had a very busy fortnight\r\nwith Dr. Sutherland in collecting statistics about various lying-in\r\nhospitals and in preparing plans, with the assistance of the Army\r\nMedical Department and War Office Sanitary Committee, on the best model.\r\nMiss Nightingale was delighted with her visitor. \"She took every point,\"\r\nshe told Dr. Sutherland, \"as quick as lightning.\" \"I have a fresh\r\nneophyte,\" she wrote to Sir John McNeill (Dec. 25, 1868), \"in the person\r\nof the Crown Princess of Prussia. She has a quick intelligence, and is\r\ncultivating herself in knowledge of sanitary (and female) administration\r\nfor her future great career. She comes alone like a girl, pulls off her\r\nhat and jacket like a five-year-old, drags about a great portfolio of\r\nplans, and kneels by my bedside correcting them. She gives a great deal\r\nof trouble. But I believe it will bear fruit.\" That the inquiries of the\r\nPrincess were searching, and her commissions exacting, appears from the\r\ncorrespondence:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to the Crown Princess of Prussia._) 35 SOUTH\r\n     STREET, _Dec._ 21 [1868]. MADAM--In grateful obedience to Your Royal\r\n     Highness's command, directing me to forward to Osborne before the\r\n     24th the commissions with which you favoured me, I send (1) the\r\n     Portfolio of plans for the Hospital near the Plotzen See, and, in this\r\n     envelope, the criticism upon the plans. Also, in another envelope\r\n     (2) a sketch of the Nursing \"hierarchy\" required to nurse this\r\n     Hospital (with a Training School attached), even to ages\r\n     desirable--as desired by Your Royal Highness. Also (3) the methods\r\n     of continuous examination in use (with full-sized copies of the\r\n     Forms) to test the progress of our Probationers (Probe-Schwestern).\r\n     Also (4) lists of the clothing and underclothing (even to changes\r\n     of linen) we give to and require from our Probationers and Nurses,\r\n     and of the changes of sheets. Your Royal Highness having directed\r\n     me to send patterns \"in paper\" of our Probationers' dress, I have\r\n     thought it better to have a complete uniform dress such as our\r\n     Probationers wear, for in-doors and out-doors, made for Your Royal\r\n     Highness's inspection, even to bonnet, cap, and collar, which will\r\n     arrive by this Messenger in a small box and parcel. I am afraid\r\n     that the aspect of these papers will be quite alarming from their\r\n     bulk. But I can only testify my gratitude for your Royal Highness's\r\n     great kindness by fulfilling as closely as I can the spirit of your\r\n     gracious will. I am sorry to say that I have not yet done\r\n     encumbering your Royal Highness. The plans for Lying-in Cottages\r\n     had to be completed at the War Office and are not quite ready. But\r\n     they shall be forwarded \"before the 24th.\" I think we have\r\n     succeeded in producing a perfectly healthy and successful Lying-in\r\n     Cottage, by means of great _sub-division_ and incessant cleanliness\r\n     and ventilation, which includes the not having _any_ ward\r\n     _constantly_ occupied. In one of these Huts we have had 600\r\n     Lyings-in consecutively without a single death or case of puerperal\r\n     disease or casualty of any kind. (This experience is, I believe,\r\n     without a fellow, but will, I trust, have many fellows before\r\n     long.) Believe me, your Royal Highness's enquiry about these things\r\n     does the greatest good, not only with regard to what is proposed in\r\n     Prussia, but in stirring up the War Office, the Medical\r\n     authorities, and other officials _here_ to consider these vital\r\n     trifles more seriously. And thus thousands of lives of poor women,\r\n     of poor patients of all kinds, will be saved, even in England,\r\n     through your Royal Highness's means. Hitherto Lying-in Hospitals\r\n     have been not to cure but to kill. As I have again to trouble your\r\n     Royal Highness about these subjects, I will not now enter into two\r\n     or three other little things with which I was commissioned. May I\r\n     beg always to be considered, Madam, the most faithful, ready and\r\n     devoted of Your Royal Highness's servants.\r\n\r\n     (_The Crown Princess of Prussia to Miss Nightingale._) OSBORNE,\r\n     _Dec._ 24 [1868]. I don't wish to lose a _minute_ in thanking you\r\n     for your great kindness and for all the trouble you have taken for\r\n     me. Your letter is so _excellent_, and all the information you give\r\n     is _most_ valuable, and will be of untold use, not only to _me_ as\r\n     a guide in my humble endeavours to promote a _serious_,\r\n     _conscientious_, and _rational_ spirit in the treatment of sanitary\r\n     matters, but to many others in Germany. Your precious time has\r\n     _not_ been wasted while you were writing for me, I assure you. The\r\n     dress I think _very_ neat and nice, and not clerical looking (which\r\n     is, in my eyes, an advantage). I was so vexed that I forgot to tell\r\n     you the other day how much I admired _Una and the Lion_. I read it\r\n     this summer in Germany, and thought it touching and lovely in the\r\n     extreme. I \"colported\" it right and left! After I have arrived at\r\n     Berlin and had leisure thoroughly to go into every detail of the\r\n     materials you have given me, I will write to you again. These few\r\n     lines are only to express my earnest thanks. The Crown Prince\r\n     wishes me to say how sorry he is never to have seen you. He shares\r\n     my feelings when your name is mentioned. I trust that the next time\r\n     I am in this country I shall see you again. I remain, dear Miss\r\n     Nightingale, yours gratefully, VICTORIA.\r\n\r\nNegotiations with the Nightingale Fund were presently opened, and the\r\nCrown Princess sent Fräulein Fuhrmann, who afterwards superintended the\r\nVictoria Training School for Nurses in Berlin (p. 204), to receive her\r\nown training as a Nightingale Nurse at St. Thomas's.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThe Nightingale Training School had for many years been extending the\r\narea of its influence, and Miss Nightingale herself, in spite of her\r\nincessant work in other fields, never lost general control and\r\nsupervision of it. Year after year, she kept up correspondence, both\r\nvoluminous and intimate, with Mrs. Wardroper, the Matron. Her\r\nbrother-in-law, Sir Harry Verney, was now Chairman of the Council of the\r\nNightingale Fund; her cousin, Mr. Henry Bonham Carter, had succeeded\r\nMr. Clough as Secretary--a duty which he continues to discharge to this\r\nday. Sir Harry Verney saw Miss Nightingale frequently with regard to the\r\nbusiness of the School. Between Mr. Bonham Carter and her there is a\r\ngreat mass of correspondence extending over forty years and more;\r\nconducted sometimes by an exchange of letters through the post,\r\nsometimes by notes of question and answer at her house, as in the case\r\nof Dr. Sutherland. Mr. Bonham Carter, alike as Secretary of the Fund and\r\nas a cousin devoted to Miss Nightingale personally, gave his time and\r\nzeal without stint to the work; but he had independence of character. He\r\nwas once asked how he contrived to do other things besides serve Miss\r\nNightingale. \"When it was getting late,\" he explained, \"I used to say,\r\nNow I must go home to dinner.\" His devotion, good sense, and\r\nbusiness-like habits contributed largely to the success of the\r\nundertaking, and saved Miss Nightingale much trouble in matters both of\r\ndetail and of general administrative policy; but questions of what may\r\nbe called the superior direction of the School were always referred to\r\nher, and there were many occasions on which her personal influence was\r\nfelt to be indispensable. It was especially brought to bear whenever a\r\ncontingent of Nightingale Nurses was sent from St. Thomas's to occupy\r\nnew ground. The phrase quoted at the head of this chapter, from a letter\r\nby Miss Agnes Jones, when she was thus sent to pioneer work in the\r\nLiverpool Workhouse, exactly expresses one side of the relationship\r\nbetween the nurses and Miss Nightingale. But she was more to them than a\r\nChief. She was not a distant and almost impersonal abstraction like \"The\r\nWidow at Windsor.\" The Lady in South Street was not only the queen of\r\nthe Nightingale Nurses, she was also their mother. The principal\r\nlieutenants who went out on important service, and many members of the\r\nrank and file, maintained constant correspondence with her--sending to\r\nher direct reports, consulting her in difficulties, looking to her, and\r\nnever in vain, for counsel and encouragement. Miss Nightingale took\r\nespecial pains to help and to influence the Lady Superintendents who\r\nwent from St. Thomas's in command of nursing parties. Among her earlier\r\npapers containing thoughts about her future work, there is more than one\r\nreference to \"Richelieu's 'Self-multiplication.'\" She strove to extend\r\nher work by creating lieutenants in her own image.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of the missionary voyages of the Nightingale\r\nNurses during these years was to New South Wales. Miss Nightingale had\r\nfor some time been in correspondence with Sir Henry Parkes, then\r\nColonial Secretary in New South Wales, about the nursing in the Sydney\r\nInfirmary, and in December 1867 Miss Osburn sailed with five nurses to\r\ntake up the position of Lady Superintendent. The nurses arrived in time\r\nto nurse Prince Alfred, when he was shot during his visit to the Colony.\r\nThere is a letter from Sir William Jenner to Miss Nightingale (July 4,\r\n1868) saying, \"I have received the Queen's commands to tell you how very\r\nuseful they were. Her Majesty says, 'She is sure this information will\r\ngive Miss Nightingale much pleasure.'\" In one respect the nurses were\r\nmore successful than Miss Nightingale desired. At first all went well.\r\nThere were difficulties with the doctors and others, of course, but Sir\r\nHenry Parkes was always helpful. There was \"no flirting,\" Miss Osburn\r\nreported (May 20), \"and all the nurses cling round me in difficulties\r\nlike true Britons.\" But they did not cling for long. Their services were\r\ntoo much appreciated. In a few years' time all the five had either\r\nmarried or received valuable appointments outside the Infirmary, and\r\nMiss Osburn had to recruit her staff from the Colony itself. Miss\r\nNightingale thought that the expedition had thus \"failed\"; but there was\r\nsomething to be said on the other side, and the diffusion of the\r\nNightingale band did much to promote the extension of trained nursing in\r\nthe Colony.\r\n\r\nAnother expedition of great importance was an extension of the Liverpool\r\nexperiment to London. In 1868 Mr. (afterwards Sir) William Wyatt, the\r\nleader of a reform party in St. Pancras, had entered into correspondence\r\nwith Miss Nightingale with regard to the new Infirmary (built under the\r\nAct of 1867) at Highgate; he submitted the plans of the building, and\r\nsuggested the introduction of Nightingale Nurses. She approved the\r\nplans, encouraged him in his good work, and in the following year (1869)\r\nMiss Elizabeth Torrance was appointed matron, with nine nurses under\r\nher. The experiment was presently extended, and a training school for\r\nnurses was established at the Infirmary. There are about one hundred\r\nletters from Miss Torrance a year, a figure which will give some idea of\r\nthe close touch which Miss Nightingale kept with important lieutenants.\r\nShe considered Miss Torrance \"the most capable Superintendent they had\r\nyet trained\" (1870), and the letters bear out the estimate. They are\r\nthose of a canny, capable and devoted woman--taking everything quietly\r\nas part of the day's work, with no fussiness or needless\r\nself-importance. \"I have never seen such nurses,\" wrote the Medical\r\nSuperintendent, when Miss Torrance and her staff had been at work for\r\nsome months; \"they are so thoroughly conversant with disease that one\r\nfeels quite on one's mettle in practice. What strikes me most is the\r\nreal interest they take in the work, and this is the secret of their\r\nsuccess\"--not attainable by the pauper nurses whom they displaced.\r\nInspectors, Guardians, and other officials would have done well to feel\r\nquite on their mettle in Miss Torrance's presence also; for her letters\r\nshow her to have been possessed of a humorous shrewdness which took the\r\nmeasure of men, by no means always at their own valuation. Miss Torrance\r\namongst other reforms introduced useful work into the occupation of the\r\ninmates. \"The achievement I am most proud of,\" she wrote (1871), \"is\r\ngetting the men's suits cut out and made. I found a tailor in No. 2 Ward\r\nwho cut out some, and I sent them into Nos. 1 and 4 to be made, but\r\nthere was a tailor in No. 1 who made difficulties, 'You see, ma'am, it's\r\nsuch a very old-fashioned cut.'\" Once a week at least the Matron wrote\r\nreporting progress or difficulties to Miss Nightingale, who replied with\r\nadvice, books, presents. Nurses, of whom the Matron reported well, came\r\nin batches to see Miss Nightingale. \"They returned,\" wrote Miss\r\nTorrance, of one occasion of the kind, \"beaming with delight, but as\r\nthey all talked about it at once I did not gather very clearly what\r\npassed. Sister A., however, feared that Sister B. 'must have tried Miss\r\nNightingale.'\" Sister B., it seems, had the same fear about Sister A.\r\nNurses and Matron alike regarded their reception by Miss Nightingale as\r\na high privilege. \"I always feel refreshed _for months_,\" wrote\r\nMrs. Wardroper (March 1871), \"after one of those affectionate receptions\r\nyou accord me.\" None of Miss Nightingale's \"soldiers\" left her cabinet\r\nwithout feeling a better and a braver woman. Miss Torrance presently\r\nfell from grace in Miss Nightingale's eyes by becoming engaged to be\r\nmarried. At a critical period of the engagement, she failed to keep\r\nsome appointments at South Street, and Miss Nightingale did not recover\r\nequanimity till she recalled to herself a saying of Mr. Clough's:\r\n\"Persons in that case should be treated as if they had the scarlet\r\nfever.\"\r\n\r\nIn November 1869 there were receptions in South Street such as a\r\nsovereign sometimes accords to warriors or statesmen on the eve of a\r\ngreat emprise. A Superintendent of Nurses (Mrs. Deeble) and a staff of\r\nsix Ward Sisters were setting out from St. Thomas's to take charge of\r\nthe War Office Hospital at Netley. Miss Nightingale received them all,\r\ngave them presents and addressed words of encouragement. \"That I have\r\n'seen Miss Nightingale'\" wrote one of them, \"will be one of the white\r\nmile-stones on my road, to which I shall often look back with feelings\r\nof gratitude and pleasure. I trust that I shall never forget some of the\r\nthings you said to me, and that 'looking up' I may be enabled to show by\r\nmy future life that your great kindness has not been thrown away.\" \"The\r\nNetley sisters,\" wrote Mrs. Wardroper, \"are overflowing with love and\r\ngratitude for all the interest and trouble you have so kindly taken for\r\nand in them. Your reception, pretty presents, and good advice have quite\r\nwon their hearts. To know you, and to have heard from your own lips,\r\nthat each one has your best wishes and prayer for success will do much\r\nto cheer and help them.\" \"I have been preaching to them four hours a\r\nday,\" wrote Miss Nightingale to M. Mohl (Nov. 21), \"and expounding\r\nRegulations. Some of them are very nice women. One was out with Dr.\r\nLivingstone and Bishop Mackenzie on the Zambesi Mission. One, a woman\r\nwho would be distinguished in any society, accidentally read my little\r\narticle on 'Una,' and wrote off to us the same night offering to go\r\nthrough our training (which she did) and join us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Expounding Regulations\" was always a part of Miss Nightingale's\r\nexhortation on such occasions. In this particular case she had a hand in\r\nmaking the Regulations. In other cases she often found them very stupid.\r\nThey were generally made by men, who were incapable, she thought (as we\r\nhave heard already), of devising suitable regulations for women. \"Oh,\r\nhow I wish there were no men,\" she wrote on one occasion when trying to\r\ncompose a hospital quarrel. But even bad regulations must be observed,\r\ntill they can be altered, and women did not always understand that some\r\ndiplomacy was necessary to obtain the alteration. \"Women,\" she said,\r\n\"are unable to see that it requires wisdom as well as self-denial to\r\nestablish any new work.\" As the work which the Nightingale Nurses had at\r\nthis time to do was all new, there were many difficulties and most of\r\nthem came up to Miss Nightingale for solution or advice. When a very\r\nlong-winded letter arrived, she would often send it on unread to Dr.\r\nSutherland, for him to digest and advise upon. It was her comfortable\r\npersuasion that he had nothing else to do, and she scolded him if there\r\nwas any delay; but sooner or later he did the work for her, and his\r\nadvice in such matters never failed in shrewd common sense. Sometimes he\r\nwould say, \"This letter shows a fit of temper on the nurse's part, and\r\nis a case for a little homily from you.\" In such homilies Miss\r\nNightingale would mingle an appeal to higher motives with a reference to\r\nher own example and experience--as in the following letter:--\r\n\r\n     (_To a Discontented Nurse._) _April_ 22 [1869]. Do you think I should\r\n     have succeeded in doing anything if I had kicked and resisted and\r\n     resented? Is it our Master's command? Is it even common sense? I\r\n     have been even shut out of hospitals into which I had been ordered\r\n     to go by the Commander-in-Chief--obliged to stand outside the door\r\n     in the snow till night--been refused rations for as much as 10 days\r\n     at a time for the nurses I had brought by superior command.[119]\r\n     And I have been as good friends the day after with the officials\r\n     who did these things--have resolutely ignored these things _for the\r\n     sake of the work_. What was I to my Master's work? When people\r\n     offend, they offend the Master, before they do me. And who am I\r\n     that I should not choose to bear what my Master chooses to bear?\r\n     You have many high and noble points of character. Else I should not\r\n     write to you as I do. But the spirit of opposition in which you are\r\n     working (or rather _were_ at the time you wrote, for I am satisfied\r\n     it was only an ebullition of the moment), and yet doing your work\r\n     well and doing good, would, if it really were persisted in,\r\n     materially increase the difficulties of that work to which, I am\r\n     sure, you are devoted.\r\n\r\n  [119] See Vol. I. p. 291.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nThere was one failure in the work of the Nightingale Fund which led Miss\r\nNightingale to write a new book, than which none ever cost her more\r\nlabour. In 1867 the Midwifery School established in King's College\r\nHospital[120] had to be closed owing to the high rate of mortality in\r\nthe lying-in wards. As soon as the figures were brought to Miss\r\nNightingale's notice, she set to work in examining the whole subject of\r\nmortality in lying-in wards. She soon found that no trustworthy\r\nstatistics of mortality in child-bed had yet been collected. She\r\nsearched for them throughout this country and from foreign hospitals and\r\ndoctors. She discovered that in lying-in wards everywhere the death-rate\r\nwas many times the amount of that which took place in home deliveries.\r\nThis fact showed that public attention should at once be called to the\r\nsubject, and at the same time it opened up larger questions. There was\r\none school of medical opinion which held that the mortality must in the\r\nnature of things be large in lying-in wards; there was another which\r\nheld that the high rate of mortality therein might be prevented. The\r\ninquiries which Miss Nightingale had made for the Crown Princess of\r\nPrussia[121] inclined her to the latter view, and she pursued her\r\nresearches in all directions, collecting an immense mass of information\r\nand calling in the assistance of sanitary engineers and other\r\nauthorities. It should be remembered in all this that the introduction\r\nof antiseptics has much altered the conditions since the time of Miss\r\nNightingale's work now under consideration. Materials for a book\r\naccumulated, but time to put them into shape was wanting. Dr.\r\nSutherland, on whose assistance she mainly relied, was no more able than\r\nshe herself to give undivided attention to the subject; but at last with\r\nhis help the book was written. It was published in October 1871, with\r\nthe title _Introductory Notes on Lying-in Institutions_. The book did\r\nfor this special subject something of the same service which _Notes on\r\nHospitals_ had done in the general sphere. Miss Nightingale showed by\r\nstatistical evidence that many lying-in wards and institutions were\r\npest-houses; she showed the importance of isolation and extreme\r\ncleanliness; and furnished model rules, plans and specifications for\r\nsanitary lying-in hospitals. In the latter pages, the book was an\r\nextension of the _Notes on Nursing_ to this special branch. She urged\r\nthe importance of training-schools for midwives; described the ideal of\r\nan institution of the kind; and pleaded for \"Midwifery as a Career for\r\nEducated Women.\" There was much agitation at the time for the admission\r\nof women to the medical profession. Miss Nightingale in a letter\r\naddressed \"Dear Sisters,\" suggested that there was \"a better thing for\r\nwomen to be than 'medical men,' and that is to be _medical women_.\" She\r\nwas in the country when the book was passing through the press; and Dr.\r\nSutherland, in sending a last revise with some suggestions of his own,\r\nsaid (July 22), \"I return the proof corrected. Don't swear, but read the\r\nreasons on the accompanying paper. It is a good thing you are at Lea\r\nHurst or your 'dear sisters' would infallibly break your head. They will\r\nprobably break your windows. However, you are clearly right, and let\r\nthem scream and stamp. The Book is a very good contribution to the\r\nsubject, and will excite surprise and some opposition. But the facts are\r\ntoo strong.\" Miss Nightingale put out her book tentatively in a\r\nquestioning spirit, as she explained in this characteristic dedication\r\n(which had received Mr. Jowett's imprimatur, but puzzled some of the\r\nreviewers):--\r\n\r\n     If I may dedicate, without permission, these small \"Notes\" to the\r\n     shade of Socrates' Mother, may I likewise, without presumption,\r\n     call to my help the questioning shade of her Son, that I who write\r\n     may have the spirit of questioning aright and that those who read\r\n     may learn not of me but of themselves? And further, has he not\r\n     said: \"The midwives are respectable women and have a character to\r\n     lose.\"[122]\r\n\r\n  [120] Vol. I. p. 464.\r\n\r\n  [121] See above, p. 189.\r\n\r\n  [122] _Theaetetus_, 150.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nThe preparation of this book had been delayed by the Franco-German War\r\nof 1870-71, which brought a great addition to Miss Nightingale's\r\nlabours. There is a huge pile of documents on the subject amongst her\r\nPapers. A letter to an old friend gives an idea of one branch of the\r\ncorrespondence:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Harriet Martineau._) 35 SOUTH STREET, _Feb._\r\n     [1871]. Oh this year of desolation! The one gleam of comfort\r\n     through it all was the rush of all English-speaking people, in all\r\n     climates and in all longitudes,--not the rich and comfortable, but\r\n     the whole mass of hard-working, honest, frugal, stupid people--who\r\n     have contributed every penny they could so ill spare. Women have\r\n     given the very shoes off their feet, the very suppers out of their\r\n     children's mouths--not to those of their own creed, not to those of\r\n     their own way of thinking at all, but--to those who _suffered\r\n     most_. In this awful war, all, all have given--every man, woman,\r\n     and child above pauperism. I have been so touched to receive from\r\n     places I had never even heard of, but which it would take me a day\r\n     to enumerate,--from congregations who had \"seen my name in a stray\r\n     London newspaper\" as helping in the relief of the war\r\n     sufferers--sums collected by halfpence (with a long letter to say\r\n     how they wished the money spent)--from poor hard-working negro\r\n     congregations in different islands of the West Indies--poor\r\n     congregations of all kinds, Puritan chapels in my own dear hills,\r\n     National Schools, Factories, London dissenting congregations\r\n     without a single rich member, London ragged schools who having\r\n     nothing to give, gave up their only feast in the year that the\r\n     money might be sent to the orphans in the war \"who want it more\r\n     than we.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the letters from distant parts of the Empire show that Florence\r\nNightingale had already become somewhat of a legendary figure. It was\r\nknown that scenes of misery and horror were being enacted in Europe. It\r\nwas assumed that she was ministering in the midst of them. In one of the\r\nletters there seems to be a confused idea that she was in two places at\r\nonce--both directing the movement in London and nursing in some Red\r\nCross hospital in France or Germany. And there is a sense in which this\r\nvague and legendary conception was true. Miss Nightingale played a busy\r\npart, though entirely behind the scenes, in the work of aid at the\r\nLondon headquarters; whilst among the devoted women who nursed the\r\nwounded or succoured other sufferers from the war, there were probably\r\nfew who did not derive inspiration from the example of the Crimean\r\nheroine.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the war had found English philanthropy unprepared. The\r\nBritish Government had been a party to the Geneva Convention, but\r\nnothing had been done to organize a Society under its rules until the\r\nalarm was sounded by Colonel Loyd Lindsay (Lord Wantage). A letter from\r\nhim in the _Times_ of July 22, 1870, led to the formation of the\r\nNational Society for Aid to the Sick and Wounded, which afterwards\r\nbecame the British Red Cross Aid Society. One of the first acts of the\r\nCommittee, of which Colonel Loyd Lindsay was Chairman, was to consult\r\nMiss Nightingale, and a letter from her was read to the public meeting\r\nat which the Society was constituted. The words of stirring appeal were\r\nreceived with loud cheers. If she had not been confined to a sick bed,\r\nshe would have volunteered to go out as a nurse. As it was, she must\r\nleave that work to others, and she gave the volunteers a characteristic\r\nnote of caution: \"Those who undertake such work must be not sentimental\r\nenthusiasts, but downright lovers of hard work. If there is any work\r\nwhich is simple, stern necessity, it is that of waiting upon the sick\r\nand wounded after a battle--serving in war-hospitals, attending to and\r\nmanaging the thousand-and-one hard dry practical details which\r\nnevertheless mainly determine the question as to whether your sick and\r\nwounded shall live or die. If there is any nonsense in people's ideas of\r\nwhat hospital nursing is, one day of real duty will root it out. There\r\nare things to be done and seen which at once separate the true metal\r\nfrom the tinkling brass both among men and women.\"[123] There were those\r\namongst her entourage who wished that she could lay all other work aside\r\nand take control of the organization. The state of her health made this\r\nimpossible, but she was closely connected with the Society's work\r\nthroughout. Her brother-in-law, Sir Harry Verney, and her cousin's\r\nhusband, Captain Galton, were active members of the Executive Committee.\r\nSir Harry's daughter, Miss Emily Verney, was an active member of the\r\nLadies' Executive Committee.[124] Captain Galton and her cousin,\r\nMr. Henry Bonham Carter, were sent early in the war to visit the\r\nhospitals of France and Germany; and when the war was over, the task of\r\nreporting upon the correspondence of the Society's agents and of the\r\nEnglish doctors was entrusted to Dr. Sutherland.[125] Through all these\r\npersonal connections, Miss Nightingale kept close touch with the\r\nSociety's work. She thought that there was a lack of vigour at the\r\nstart. Why, she wanted to know, did not the Society advertise itself\r\nmore? \"If it had been in hiding from its creditors instead of being an\r\nAid Society, it could not have had a more complete success; if it had\r\nbeen sick and wounded itself, what could it have done less?\" Its\r\nadvertisement ought to appear every day \"immediately above the\r\nTheatrical Announcements--with a list of articles wanted, and an\r\nacknowledgement of those received. It makes me mad to see advertisements\r\nonly of the 'Voysey Defence Fund' and the 'Derby Memorial Fund.' What\r\n_does_ it matter whether Voysey is defended or not, and whether Lord\r\nDerby has a memorial or not?\"[126] The Committee in reply hoped to do\r\nmore presently; as it did--it collected nearly £300,000 and rendered a\r\ngreat deal of aid, both in France and in Germany. From the moment that\r\nthe war was seen to be inevitable, Miss Nightingale had been deluged\r\nwith correspondence. The French authorities applied to her for plans of\r\ntemporary field hospitals. The Crown Princess of Prussia applied for\r\nassistance and advice in all sorts. \"The dreaded letter has come,\" she\r\nwrote to Dr. Sutherland; \"what _am_ I to answer; how to express sympathy\r\nwith Prussia without alienating France?\" Miss Nightingale's personal\r\nsympathies were rather on the French side. \"I think,\" she wrote (Dec.\r\n20), \"that if the conduct of the French for the last three months had\r\nbeen shown by any other nation it would have been called _as it is_\r\nsublime. The uncomplaining endurance, the sad and severe self-restraint\r\nof Paris under a siege now of three months would have rendered immortal\r\na city of ancient Rome. The Army of the Loire fighting seven days out of\r\nnine barefoot, cold and frozen, yet unsubdued, is worthy of Henry V. and\r\nAgincourt. And all for what? To save Alsace and Lorraine, of which Paris\r\nscarcely knows.\" In writing to the Crown Princess on hospital matters\r\nshe put in a plea for clemency in the hour of final victory. \"Prussia\r\nwould remember,\" she was sure, \"the future wars and misery always\r\nbrought about by trampling too violently on a fallen foe, and Germany\r\nwill show to an astonished Europe that moderation of which victorious\r\nnations have hitherto shown themselves incapable.\" Miss Nightingale,\r\nhere as in other matters, hoped more of human perfectibility than she\r\nwas to find; the immediate future was to belie her picture alike of the\r\nsevere self-restraint of Paris, and of the unexampled moderation of\r\nPrussia. In rendering aid to the sick and wounded she was, however,\r\nconsistently impartial. Wherever she heard of good work being done,\r\nwhether in France or in Germany, she was ready to help, and she gave\r\ndisinterested advice to the nursing service in both armies. Throughout\r\nthe war, she had a large correspondence both at home and with all sorts\r\nand conditions of people in France and Germany.\r\n\r\n  [123] The letter is printed in the _Times_ of August 5, 1870. It was\r\n        dated August 2, \"the day,\" as Miss Nightingale noted in the letter,\r\n        \"of Sidney Herbert's death nine years ago.\"\r\n\r\n  [124] She died in 1872--\"such a genius for working for men,\" Miss\r\n        Nightingale wrote of her, \"so lovely, so loving, and so beloved.\"\r\n\r\n  [125] _Report of the British National Society for Aid to the Sick and\r\n        Wounded during the Franco-German War, 1871_, pp. 149-177.\r\n\r\n  [126] Letters to Captain Galton, August 1870.\r\n\r\nAt home, she was diligent in collecting money and gifts in kind for the\r\nAid Society. She wrote constant letters and memoranda to members of the\r\nExecutive Society; advising on all matters, from the general\r\nadministration of field ambulances to the pattern of hospital suits,\r\nvetoing (when she could) impracticable suggestions, sending lists of the\r\nthings most urgently needed. She received and answered a constant stream\r\nof applications from persons inquiring what to send, and from doctors\r\nand nurses wanting to volunteer for service. Abroad, her correspondence\r\nwas on a similar scale. Distributing agents of the Society, nurses,\r\nworkers of all kinds wrote, consulting her in cases of perplexity or\r\ngiving information on points that they thought likely to interest her.\r\nThe private reports preserved among Miss Nightingale's papers contain a\r\nmass of information about the treatment of the sick and wounded, of\r\nwhich she expressed the opinion that it far surpassed in horror, as of\r\ncourse it vastly exceeded in scale, anything that she had witnessed in\r\nthe Crimea. Self-devotion on the part of volunteers, though it could not\r\nremedy the evils, was conspicuous in relieving them, and many letters to\r\nMiss Nightingale are eloquent of the inspiration which was derived from\r\nher example in the Crimea and from the messages of sympathy,\r\nencouragement and advice which she now sent. \"Tell Miss Nightingale,\"\r\nsaid the warm-hearted Grand Duchess of Baden, \"that I have endeavoured\r\nto follow implicitly everything she has recommended, and that I love and\r\nrespect her more than any one in the world.\" There are letters, too,\r\nfrom English and German nurses and workers in which Miss Nightingale is\r\naddressed as \"dearest of all friends\" or \"beloved mistress\" and \"queen.\"\r\nHer services to both of the belligerents were recognized by decorations.\r\nThe French Société de Secours aux Blessés conferred its bronze cross\r\nupon her (July 1871), and from H.M. the Emperor and King she received\r\nthe Prussian Cross of Merit (Sept.). But there was more significance in\r\nwhat she gave than in what she received. Among the English ladies who\r\nrendered most devoted service during the war was the wife of an officer\r\n(Colonel Cox) who had known Miss Nightingale in the Crimea; among the\r\nGerman ladies who had done the like was Madame Werckner of Breslau. When\r\nthe war was over, both ladies asked the favour of an interview with Miss\r\nNightingale. Madame Werckner became her personal friend, and wrote with\r\nenthusiastic gratitude when she was asked to visit Embley: \"the home of\r\nyour childhood.\" And Mrs. Cox wrote (July 15): \"How can I ever thank you\r\nfor the loving reception you gave me? I can only say that never whilst I\r\nlive can it be forgotten.\" To Mrs. Cox's work the English Committee\r\nreferred in their Report. Of Madame Werckner Miss Nightingale told\r\nsomething in an address to the Probationers at St. Thomas's. \"At a large\r\nGerman station, which almost all the prisoners' trains passed through, a\r\nlady went every night during all that long, long dreadful winter, and\r\nfor the whole night, to feed and warm and comfort and often to receive\r\nthe last dying words of the miserable French prisoners, as they arrived\r\nin open trucks, some frozen, some as dead, others to die in the station,\r\nall half-clad and starving. Night after night, as these long, terrible\r\ntrainsfull dragged their slow length into the station, she kneeled on\r\nits pavement, supporting the dying heads, receiving their last messages\r\nto their mothers; pouring wine or hot milk down the throats of the sick;\r\ndressing the frost-bitten limbs; and, thank God, saving many. Many were\r\ncarried to the prisoners' hospital in the town, of whom about two-thirds\r\nrecovered. Every bit of linen she had went in this way. She herself\r\ncontracted incurable ill-health during these fearful nights. But\r\nthousands were saved by her means. She is my friend. She came and saw\r\nme, and it is from her lips I heard the story.\"\r\n\r\nThe Crown Princess of Prussia also came to South Street, and \"she let me\r\ntell her,\" wrote Miss Nightingale,[127] \"a good deal of behind the\r\nscenes of Prussian Ambulance work. I do like her so very much and twice\r\nas much now that she is really worn and ripened by genuine hard work and\r\nanxiety.\" This visit was productive of large results. The Princess and\r\nMiss Nightingale had been in communication throughout the war--partly by\r\ndirect correspondence, and partly through an English lady, Miss Florence\r\nLees, who was serving in German hospitals. At the beginning of the war\r\nthe Princess had telegraphed and written to Miss Nightingale begging her\r\nto recommend a thoroughly competent English lady for such duty. Miss\r\nLees (Mrs. Dacre Craven) had been sent; she was one of the ablest of the\r\nladies who received training at the Nightingale School, and was\r\npresently to play an important part in the development of trained\r\nnursing in London. Miss Lees was placed by the Crown Princess in charge\r\nof the nursing at a war hospital which she had arranged at Homburg; Miss\r\nLees was also employed to visit and report upon the war hospitals at\r\nMetz and other places. She was in constant correspondence with Miss\r\nNightingale, who from this and many other sources of information had\r\nformed a very poor opinion of the Prussian nursing, medical and\r\nambulance service. After collating various reports with Dr. Sutherland,\r\nMiss Nightingale said to him that \"the abnormally bad among the Crimean\r\nhospitals were luxurious compared with the normal Prussian hospitals.\"\r\n\"The only Prussian hospitals up to the present standard of sanitary\r\nexperience,\" she added, \"are those of the Princess herself, and in them\r\nit was H.R.H. who taught the doctors, and not the doctors who taught\r\nher.\" I do not know whether she communicated to the Princess the further\r\nopinion that the root of the evil was the bureaucracy; \"it shows what it\r\nmeans to be without the free play of public opinion, through Parliament\r\nand press, which calls every Public Office, and almost every Society, to\r\naccount.\" But upon the facts Miss Nightingale spoke freely, as she was\r\nrequested to do, and the Princess asked her to send documents:--\r\n\r\n     (_The Crown Princess of Germany to Miss Nightingale._) OSBORNE,\r\n     _July_ 28 [1871]. I return the deeply interesting and important\r\n     papers which the Crown Prince and myself have read _most_\r\n     attentively and word for word. The Crown Prince wishes me to thank\r\n     you particularly for your having let him see these papers. Much was\r\n     not new to him. You _know_ how much interest he takes in sanitary\r\n     matters, how anxious he is for reforms wherever needed. Every\r\n     remark offered is therefore always gratefully received by us. Let\r\n     me repeat, dear Miss Nightingale, how great a happiness it was to\r\n     me to see you again. Ever yours, with sincerest admiration and\r\n     respect, VICTORIA, CROWN PRINCESS OF GERMANY.\r\n\r\n  [127] Letter to Harriet Martineau, Sept. 20, 1870.\r\n\r\nOf the great and practical interest which the Princess already took in\r\nhospitals, we have heard above. The experiences of the Franco-Prussian\r\nWar quickened it yet more, and in 1872 she drafted a report on hospital\r\norganization. Subsequently a Home and Nursing School, named after her,\r\nwas established in Berlin, and the \"Victoria Sisters,\" following the\r\nlead of the Nightingale Nurses, undertook the nursing in municipal\r\nhospitals. The success of the Victoria Training School led in its turn\r\nto the establishment of similar institutions throughout Germany. And\r\nthus Miss Nightingale's words came true, that the trouble which she took\r\nto inform and inspire the Crown Princess \"will bear fruit.\"\r\n\r\nThe experience of the Franco-German War bore fruit in the better\r\norganization of the Red Cross movement, especially in this country, and\r\nthe inspiration here too may be traced back to Miss Nightingale. The\r\n\"Red Cross\" owes its inception, as already stated, to a Swiss physician,\r\nM. Henri Dunant. He had witnessed the horrors of war on the bloody field\r\nof Solferino, and he devoted his life thenceforward to the promotion,\r\nand then to the extension, of the Geneva Convention. In 1872 M. Dunant\r\nread a paper in London upon the movement. His first words were these:\r\n\"Though I am known as the founder of the Red Cross and the originator of\r\nthe Convention of Geneva, it is to an Englishwoman that all the honour\r\nof that Convention is due. What inspired me to go to Italy during the\r\nwar of 1859 was the work of Miss Florence Nightingale in the\r\nCrimea.\"[128]\r\n\r\n  [128] M. Dunant's Paper is reported in the _Times_ of August 7, 1872. He\r\n        sent a copy of it to Miss Nightingale: see Bibliography B, No. 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nIt will have been seen that during the years treated in the foregoing\r\nchapters (1867-1871) Miss Nightingale did an enormous amount of work.\r\nHer health during the same period had been no better. Country air did\r\nnot bring any accession of strength; there is evidence of sleepless\r\nnights in numbers of her letters dated in the small hours of the\r\nmorning; and during 1870 and 1871 especially her letters and diaries\r\nspeak of great weakness. She was able to do as much as she did only by\r\nthe devotion of the same friend, Dr. Sutherland, whose relations with\r\nhis task-mistress have been described in an earlier chapter. More and\r\nmore, indeed, she seems to have fallen into the habit, which had become\r\nalmost a necessity, of saying nothing, doing nothing, writing nothing\r\n(her letters to Mr. Jowett and a few other intimate friends alone\r\nexcepted) without first consulting Dr. Sutherland. I have illustrated\r\nthis point incidentally in previous pages, but such occasional\r\nreferences give an inadequate account of the extent to which she relied\r\nupon him. \"The only way I can work now,\" she wrote to him in 1870, \"is\r\nby receiving written notes from you, and working them up into my own\r\nlanguage, then printing and showing you the work.\" Her Papers, with\r\nhundreds upon hundreds of drafts and memoranda in Dr. Sutherland's hand,\r\nshow that such was in fact the way in which the work was done, and the\r\nprocess was applied not only to things ultimately printed, but almost to\r\nthe whole range of her correspondence. He was sometimes called upon to\r\ndraft even the most delicate family letters. She was asked to suggest an\r\ninscription for a memorial to Agnes Jones at Liverpool. Dr. Sutherland\r\nhad first to try his hand at it. She was put out by an unwarranted\r\nliberty which a publisher had taken with her name. The case was sent to\r\nDr. Sutherland, with a pressing appeal, \"What _shall_ I do? I have no\r\none to act for me.\" He acted for her. He had artistic tastes, and served\r\nas eyes for her at the International Exhibition of 1871, when he\r\nselected some French bronzes for her to give to Mr. Jowett. Whenever she\r\nwas asked to join a Society, or subscribe to a new institution, Dr.\r\nSutherland had first to advise and report. Sometimes she accompanied her\r\nreferences to him with amusing comments, as to Uncle Sam in earlier\r\ndays. Did Dr. Sutherland advise her to join a new \"Central Philanthropic\r\nAgency\"? She was inclined against it, remembering that \"When Crosse\r\ninvented a new insect, my grandmother was heard to exclaim, 'Are there\r\nnot enough insects already?'\" Sometimes a reference may have been made\r\nonly, or mainly, for the fun of the thing; as when the Census Paper was\r\nleft at South Street in 1871 and she sent it off by special messenger to\r\nDr. Sutherland at the War Office to know how she was to fill it up. \"Am\r\nI the head of this household?\" Dr. Sutherland forbore to say that no\r\ndoubt was conceivable about _that_. \"Occupation column: as I think that\r\n_every_ body ought to have a defined occupation, I should like to put\r\nwhat mine is, but I don't know how to define it.\" \"Oh,\" replied Dr.\r\nSutherland, \"say, Occupation, None.\" The last column inquired whether\r\nthe householder was \"Deaf-and-dumb, blind, imbecile, or lunatic?\" \"I\r\nshall return,\" said she, \"Imbecile and Blind, and if everybody did the\r\nsame now, it would be true.\" \"Don't,\" replied he; \"you are the\r\nexception.\" But for the most part her references to him were on matters\r\nwhich either called for some quick application of worldly wisdom or\r\ninvolved considerable drudgery. His shrewd good sense never failed; and\r\nthe drudgery, though it may have been delayed, was always done in the\r\nend. She is asked to express an opinion on some Indian Health Reports,\r\nand is tired. Off they go to Dr. Sutherland, who replies: \"I have been\r\nthrough them all; you may safely say they are very well done.\" Or,\r\npamphlets, memorials, prospectuses, are sent to her, and she is in no\r\nmood to master them. They are consigned to him; and in course of time\r\nneat little digests are returned, and she is advised what to do or say.\r\nEvery important letter is similarly sent to him with a note saying,\r\n\"What am I to answer?\" or \"What does all this come to?\" or \"Please\r\nadvise.\" \"You _must_ come to-morrow to see my letter before it goes.\" \"I\r\nwant to ask you some questions, and you must be good.\" In years when\r\nMiss Nightingale was much in the country (as in 1870 and 1871), Dr.\r\nSutherland's daily work for her was the heavier, because all\r\ncommunications were through the post. There was fret and jar between\r\nthem in personal intercourse, as we have heard, and opportunity for\r\nmisunderstanding was increased when two busy people were exchanging\r\nideas by letter. This was especially the case when any work was on hand\r\nof which the scope had not been precisely defined, and Miss Nightingale\r\nwas often impatient. \"I could do work,\" she wrote on one occasion, \"if\r\nit were real work, done at the least expenditure to myself. But to do a\r\nminimum of work at the greatest expenditure to myself (by driving,\r\npumping, etc.) is now physically impossible to me.\" Such complaints and\r\nsuch references to her weakness were frequent. To the latter Dr.\r\nSutherland always referred in terms of sympathy--\"I know you are very\r\nill,\" \"I beg you to let me help as much as I can,\" and so forth. With\r\nregard to the complaints, he sometimes laughed them aside: \"Thanks for\r\nyour parting kick, which is always pleasant to receive by them as likes\r\nit.\" \"You are a true Paddy, you like to trail your coat, but I won't\r\ntread on it.\" Sometimes he defended himself--\"If you knew what I have\r\nhad to do, I am quite sure you would not have written about the proof as\r\nyou have done\"; and sometimes he refrained from defence other than\r\nsimple denial--\"I scarcely know how otherwise to reply to your attack\r\nthan simply to state that it is groundless. Am I such a fool, I ask\r\nmyself, as to do what she says I have done?\" But this admirable man\r\nnever lost his temper, and never made her reproaches an occasion for\r\ndeclining to help her any more. \"All I can say is, I am ready to help.\"\r\n\"I am at your orders in this as in all things.\" Such is the continual\r\nnote of his messages. In private meditations often, and in letters\r\noccasionally, Miss Nightingale spoke of herself as a \"vampyre.\" When she\r\nwrote in some such sense to Mr. Jowett, he told her to put such talk\r\naside as idle, for \"that way madness lies.\" Yet in a sense there was an\r\nelement of truth in what she said. She was terribly exacting. She\r\naccepted no excuses, made few allowances, and sometimes assumed that\r\nthose who worked with her had nothing else to do. Dr. Sutherland was a\r\nhard worker, but allowed himself diversions. At Norwood he had a garden,\r\nand Miss Nightingale was sarcastic about his fondness for digging ponds.\r\nBut he had also, besides a strong interest in their common work, an\r\nabiding admiration for the gifts, the character, and the self-devotion\r\nof his friend. In addition to his own bread-winning work, he gave an\r\nimmense amount of time and labour to Miss Nightingale. In any estimate\r\nof her services to great public causes, and especially in connection\r\nwith sanitation in India, an honourable place is due to the collaborator\r\nwho helped her through many years with unfailing devotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART VII\r\n\r\n                            WORK OF LATER YEARS\r\n\r\n                                (1872-1910)\r\n\r\n\r\n                  I ask no heaven till earth be Thine,\r\n                  Nor glory-crown, while work of mine\r\n                  Remaineth here.

The way of influencing mankind by ideas is the\r\n     more excellent way.--BENJAMIN JOWETT (_Letters to Miss Nightingale,\r\n     1871, 1872_).\r\n\r\n\"Something which you said to me on Sunday has rather disquieted me, and\r\nI hope that you will allow me to remonstrate with you about it. You said\r\nthat you were going to ask admission as a Patient to St. Thomas's\r\nHospital. Do not do this. (1) Because it is eccentric and we cannot\r\nstrengthen our lives by eccentricity. (2) Because you will not be a\r\nPatient but a kind of Directress to the institution, viewed with great\r\nalarm by the doctors. (3) When a person is engaged in a great work I do\r\nnot think the expense of living is much to be considered; the only thing\r\nis that you should live in such a way that you can do your work best.\r\n(4) I would not oppose you living at less expense if you wish, though I\r\nthink that a matter of no moment; but I would live independently. (5) Do\r\nyou mean really to live as a Patient? it will kill you. I do not add the\r\nannoyance to your father of a step which he can never be made to\r\nunderstand; I look at the matter solely from the point of view of your\r\nown work. I have cared about you for many years; and though I have\r\nlittle hope of prevailing with you, I would ask you not to set aside\r\nthese reasons without consideration.\" So Mr. Jowett wrote to Miss\r\nNightingale on June 22, 1872. \"I am flattered to hear,\" he wrote a\r\nlittle later (July 11), \"that you have disregarded duty and conscience\r\nfor my sake. I hope that you will never in future obey a conscience\r\nwhich tells you to kill yourself. Will you try to hope and be at peace;\r\nand just ask of God time to complete your work? You who have done so\r\nmuch for others ought sometimes to reflect that you have had a great\r\nblessing and happiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe intention which Miss Nightingale had formed and from which\r\nMr. Jowett dissuaded her was not a passing fancy. It was in accord with\r\na deep-seated conviction, as may be seen from a document already quoted\r\n(p. 103). Nor, though she listened to Mr. Jowett's advice, did she\r\nentirely abandon her purpose. Later in the year, she still thought of\r\ngiving up her pleasant house in South Street, and she set various\r\nfriends to report upon furnished apartments in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of St. Thomas's Hospital. They could not find anything\r\nthat seemed suitable, and she gave up the idea; but as she could not go\r\nto St. Thomas's, she contrived, as we shall hear in a later chapter,\r\nthat St. Thomas's should come to her. She devoted herself from this time\r\nmore largely than heretofore to the detailed supervision of the\r\nNightingale School. Both in what she did, and in what she now left\r\nundone, the year 1872 marks a new departure in her life. It is explained\r\nby a summary entry in her diary: \"This year I go out of office.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale had been \"in office,\" as she called it, continuously\r\nsince her departure for Scutari in October 1854. She had been closely\r\nemployed, that is to say, sometimes officially, sometimes unofficially,\r\nupon the administrative work of various Departments in matters\r\npertaining to her special interests. With the advent of Mr. Gladstone to\r\npower in 1868, her work in this sort had much diminished. Her friend,\r\nCaptain Galton, had gone from the War Office. She occasionally\r\nintervened in minor matters, as on one occasion when her friend,\r\nMr. Lowe, agreed with Mr. Cardwell to accept her view about a certain\r\npension to the widow of an officer, and there were other cases of the\r\nkind: as when she obtained an attentive hearing from Mr. Bruce (Home\r\nSecretary) for a memorandum which she submitted on the working of the\r\nContagious Diseases Act. But her constant employment in connection with\r\nthe War Office was over. She had argued with herself, in some\r\nmeditations during 1871, whether she ought to make a bid, as it were,\r\nfor \"office\" again. She could still exercise a certain official\r\ninfluence, she thought, if she chose to seek out Ministers and ask them\r\nto call upon her. But the political times were out of joint, she argued\r\non the other side, so far as her special aptitudes were concerned. The\r\nstrength of Mr. Gladstone's Government was thrown into political reform,\r\nnot into administration; the administration of the departments, as she\r\nwas not alone in thinking, was defective. There are many letters of this\r\nperiod in which she contrasts the days of Peel and Sidney Herbert with\r\nthose of Gladstone or Disraeli. \"But I must stop,\" she says in one of\r\nthem, \"or you will say that I am aping Southey who said, you know, that\r\nthe last Ministry was so bad that nothing could be worse except the\r\npresent; but Coleridge differed from him, for he thought the present\r\nMinistry so bad that nothing could be worse except the last.\"[129] At\r\nany rate what Miss Nightingale cared for and was fitted for, she said to\r\nherself, was only administration; in the years when she was \"in office\"\r\nshe had not only written Reports, she had been able to organize the\r\nmechanism for carrying them out. Now that administration was going, as\r\nshe thought, to the dogs, it was time for her to be out of office. That\r\nsuch was the lot appointed to her, was borne in by something that\r\nhappened early in 1872. In February Lord Mayo was assassinated--a\r\npersonal grief to Miss Nightingale and \"a great blow,\" she said, to her\r\ncause; and Lord Northbrook was appointed to succeed him as\r\nGovernor-General. Miss Nightingale was personally acquainted with Lord\r\nNorthbrook, who had been a friend (as also for a time a colleague) of\r\nSidney Herbert, but he left for India without coming to see her. \"You\r\nhave worked for eternity,\" wrote Mr. Jowett (April 3), to whom she had\r\nreported the new Viceroy's neglect; \"why should you be troubled at the\r\nGovernor-General not coming to see you (as he most certainly ought to\r\nhave done)? Put not your trust in princes or in princesses or in the War\r\nOffice or in the India Office; all that sort of thing necessarily rests\r\non a sandy foundation. I wonder that you have been able to carry on so\r\nlong with them.\" Lord Northbrook was friendly nevertheless, as appears\r\nfrom his reply when she wrote and asked him to see Mr. Clark, the\r\nsanitary and civil engineer:--\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Northbrook to Miss Nightingale._) CALCUTTA, _Jan._ 3 [1873].\r\n     I had great pleasure in seeing Mr. Clark, for I had seen his works\r\n     at Barrachpore and knew of the great results which, so far as the\r\n     statistics up to the present time can be said to prove them, have\r\n     followed from the supply of pure water to Calcutta. I hope soon to\r\n     see his drainage works at the Salt Lakes, and I have got the\r\n     particulars of his plan for catch-water roofs for military\r\n     buildings, which I will look at carefully as soon as I can. At\r\n     present I am a little overwhelmed with business which has been\r\n     accumulating during my tour. You may be assured of two things, that\r\n     I fully understand the importance of pure water for the soldiers,\r\n     and that I shall always receive with pleasure and consider with\r\n     attention any suggestions, which you may kindly give me, both on\r\n     your own account and because you were so much associated on these\r\n     matters with my old master, Lord Herbert. Yours very sincerely,\r\n     NORTHBROOK.\r\n\r\n  [129] Letter to Sir Bartle Frere, July 2, 1872.\r\n\r\nShe did not, however, at the time follow up this opening. She had taken\r\nLord Northbrook's neglect to call upon her as a further indication that\r\nshe was meant to go out of office.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThe question had become instant thereupon, What was she to do next?\r\nMr. Jowett's letters to her at this time, as also her own private notes,\r\nshow that she was in a mood of great depression; due in part to much\r\nphysical weakness and suffering, but in part also to unsettlement in her\r\nplan of life. She knew not exactly what to be at. She saw before her, as\r\nshe wrote, \"no consecutive path growing out of one's own deeds, but only\r\na succession of disjointed lives and unconnected events.\" \"Never,\" she\r\nwrote again, \"has God let me feel weariness of active life, but only\r\nanxiety to get on. Now in old age I never wish to be relieved from new\r\nwork, but only to have it to do.\" With what zeal she threw herself into\r\nfuller work for the Nightingale School at St. Thomas's, we shall hear;\r\nbut that was not enough. She could not see nurses and write to nurses\r\nall day long--though indeed she devoted to such duties as many hours as\r\nsome people would consider a sufficient day's work, and besides she was\r\nnow spending a large part of the year with her father or mother in the\r\ncountry. She needed some recreation, and the only recreation she ever\r\nfound was in change of work. She sought no \"glory-crown\" over folded\r\nhands. Mr. Jowett seized the occasion to repeat his advice that she\r\nshould find recreation in literary work. Now that she meant to free\r\nherself from official drudgery, let her gain permanent influence by\r\nwriting books or essays. \"I think,\" he said, \"that you seem to me to\r\nhave more ideas than any one whom I know.\" And again (Dec. 14, 1871):\r\n\"You have many original thoughts, but you either insert them in\r\nBlue-books or cast them before swine--that is me, and I sometimes insert\r\nthem in sermons. You should have a more consecutive way of going on.\"\r\nShe recalled, too, advice and remonstrances which she had received from\r\nMr. Mill. In 1867 the \"National Society for Woman's Suffrage\" was\r\nfounded. Mill had asked her to join it and she had at first refused:--\r\n\r\n     (_John Stuart Mill to Miss Nightingale._) BLACKHEATH PARK, _August_\r\n     9 [1867]. As I know how fully you appreciate a great many of the\r\n     evil effects produced upon the character of women (and operating to\r\n     the destruction of their own and others' happiness) by the existing\r\n     state of opinion, and as you have done me the honour to express\r\n     some regard for my opinion on these subjects, I should not like to\r\n     abstain from mentioning the formation of a Society aimed in my\r\n     opinion at the very root of all the evils you deplore and have\r\n     passed your life in combating. There are a great number of people,\r\n     particularly women, who, from want of the habit of reflecting on\r\n     politics, are quite incapable of realizing the enormous power of\r\n     politics, that is to say, of legislation, to confer happiness and\r\n     also to influence the opinion and the moral nature of the governed.\r\n     As I am convinced that this power is by far the greatest that it is\r\n     possible to wield for human happiness, I can neither approve of\r\n     women who decline the responsibility of wielding it, nor of men who\r\n     would shut out women from the right to wield it. Until women do\r\n     wield it to the best of their ability, little or great, and that in\r\n     a direct open manner, I am convinced that the evils of which I know\r\n     you to be peculiarly aware can never be satisfactorily dealt with.\r\n     And this conviction must be my apology for troubling you.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Handwritten notes]\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to John Stuart Mill._) 35 SOUTH STREET, _August_\r\n     11 [1867]. I can't tell you how much pleased I was nor how grateful\r\n     I feel that you should take the trouble to write to me. And if I\r\n     ill-naturedly answer your question by asking one, it is because I\r\n     have scarcely any one who can give me (as my dear friend,\r\n     Mr. Clough, long since dead, said) a \"considered opinion.\" That\r\n     women should have the suffrage, I think no one can be more deeply\r\n     convinced than I. It is so important for a woman to be a \"person,\"\r\n     as you say. And I think I see this most strongly in married life.\r\n     If the woman is not a \"person,\" it does almost infinite harm even\r\n     to her husband. And the harm is greatest when the man is a very\r\n     clever man and the woman a very clever woman. But it will be years\r\n     before you obtain the suffrage for women. And in the meantime there\r\n     are evils which press much more hardly on women than the want of\r\n     the suffrage. And will not this when obtained put women in\r\n     opposition to those who withhold these rights from them, so as to\r\n     retard still further the legislation which is necessary to put them\r\n     in possession of their rights? I ask humbly, and I am afraid you\r\n     will laugh at me. Could not the existing disabilities as to\r\n     property and influence of women be swept away by the legislature as\r\n     it stands at present? and equal responsibilities be given, as they\r\n     ought to be, to both men and women? I do not like to take up your\r\n     time with giving instances, redressible by legislation, in which my\r\n     experience tells me that women, and especially poor and married\r\n     women, are most hardly pressed upon now. No matron, serving on a\r\n     large scale as I have done, and with the smallest care for her\r\n     Nurses, can be unaware of these. Till a married woman can be in\r\n     possession of her own property, there can be no love or justice.\r\n     But there are many other evils, as I need not tell you. Is it\r\n     possible that, if woman suffrage is agitated as a means of removing\r\n     these evils, the effect may be to prolong their existence? Is it\r\n     not the case that at present there is no opposition between the two\r\n     elements of the nation, but that, if both had equal political\r\n     power, there is a probability that the social reforms required\r\n     might become matter of political partizanship, and so the weaker go\r\n     to the wall? I can scarcely expect that you will have time to\r\n     answer my humble questions.\r\n\r\n     As to my being on the Society you mention, you know there is\r\n     scarcely anything which, if you were to tell me that it is right\r\n     politically, I would not do. But I have no time. It is 14 years\r\n     this very day that I entered upon work which has never left me ten\r\n     minutes' leisure, not even to be ill. And I am obliged never to\r\n     give my name where I cannot give my work. If you will not think\r\n     me egotistical, I will say why I have kept off the stage of these\r\n     things. In the years that I have passed in Government offices, I\r\n     have never felt the want of a vote--because, if I had been a\r\n     Borough returning two members to Parliament, I should have had less\r\n     administrative influence. And I have thought that I could work\r\n     better for others off the stage than on it. Added to which, I am an\r\n     incurable invalid, entirely a prisoner to my room. But I entirely\r\n     agree, if I may be allowed to agree with so great an authority,\r\n     that women's \"political power\" should be \"direct and open,\" not\r\n     indirect. And I ought to ask your pardon for occupying you for one\r\n     single moment with my own personal situation.\r\n\r\n     As you have had the kindness to let me address you, I cannot help\r\n     putting in one more word on a subject very near my heart--the India\r\n     Sanitary Service. I have worked very hard at this for six years.\r\n     And during all those years, my great wish has been: would it be\r\n     possible to ask Mr. Mill for his help and influence? But you were\r\n     so busy. Pray believe me, dear Sir, ever your faithful servant,\r\n     FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\nMr. Mill found time for a \"considered opinion,\" of great elaboration and\r\nweight; it has been printed elsewhere.[130] With his reply to Miss\r\nNightingale's humble but argumentative questions, we are not here\r\nconcerned. Though she never took any prominent part in the movement for\r\nfemale suffrage, she joined the Society in 1868, allowed her name to be\r\nplaced on the General Committee in 1871, was an annual subscriber to its\r\nfunds, and in 1878 sent an expression of her opinion on the subject for\r\npublication.[131] It was, however, Mr. Mill's remarks upon her \"personal\r\nsituation\" that now, in 1872, came back to her. \"If,\" he had said, \"you\r\nprefer to do your work rather by moving the hidden springs than by\r\nallowing yourself to be known to the world as doing what you really do,\r\nit is not for me to make any observations on this preference (inasmuch\r\nas I am bound to presume that you have good reasons for it) other than\r\nto say that I much regret that this preference is so very general among\r\nwomen.\" She ought not, he went on to suggest, to hide her good deeds;\r\nand \"finally I feel,\" he wrote, \"some hesitation in saying to you what I\r\nthink of the responsibility that lies upon each one of us to stand\r\nsteadfastly, and with all the boldness and all the humility that a deep\r\nsense of duty can inspire, by what the experience of life and an honest\r\nuse of our own intelligence has taught us to be the truth.\" To some of\r\nthis expostulation she had at the time a conclusive rejoinder. She could\r\nnot write to the _Times_ and say, \"Be it known that I suggested such and\r\nsuch a dispatch to a Secretary of State, and am corresponding in such\r\nand such a sense with a Governor-General.\" But if she were out of\r\noffice, the plea for seclusion behind the scenes failed; nor was it ever\r\nperhaps of much cogency in relation to her views on religious and social\r\nmatters. Now that she had \"gone out of office,\" was it not her duty to\r\ncome into the open with her pen?\r\n\r\n  [130] In the _Letters of John Stuart Mill_, 1910, vol. ii. pp. 100-105.\r\n\r\n  [131] Quoted in Bibliography A, No. 93.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThe first literary task which Miss Nightingale set herself under this\r\nimpulse took the form of a series of magazine articles, in which she\r\nhoped to embody the leading ideas contained in the voluminous\r\n_Suggestions for Thought_ already described (Vol. I. p. 470). \"During\r\nthe ten years and more that I have known you,\" wrote Mr. Jowett (Oct.\r\n31, 1872), \"you have repeated to me the expression 'Character of God'\r\nabout 1000 times, but I can't say that I have any clear idea of what you\r\nmean.\" Why did she not try and explain? In an earlier letter (Feb. 28,\r\n1871) Mr. Jowett had suggested \"the form of short papers or\r\nessays.\" She now wrote three of them (of which the first two were\r\npublished)--entitled respectively \"A 'Note' of Interrogation,\" \"A\r\nSub-Note of Interrogation: What will our Religion be in 1999,\" and \"On\r\nwhat Government night will Mr. Lowe bring out our New Moral Budget?\r\nanother Sub-Note of Interrogation.\" In the first Paper, Miss Nightingale\r\nin a questioning and allusive style defined her conception of God as a\r\nGod of Law, whose character may be learnt from social and moral science,\r\nand defended such a conception against some current ideas of Christian\r\nchurches on the one side, and against the too cold and impersonal creed,\r\nas she thought, of Positivism on the other. The affinity of her doctrine\r\nat some points with the creed of Positivism is obvious; but she held as\r\nan axiom that the existence of law implied a law-giver; and \"it is a\r\nvery different thing,\" she wrote elsewhere,[132] \"fighting against evil\r\nfor our own sakes or fighting for the sake of the Law-Giver who arms\r\nus--fighting with or without a Commander.\" The scope of the second Paper\r\nis harder to describe, for it throws out a large number of criticisms\r\nand suggestions on life, morals, and philosophy in no very closely\r\nrelated order. The general idea, however, is that the purification of\r\nreligion requires not destructive criticism but reconstruction and a\r\nre-ordering of modern life on the lines of social service; in which\r\nlatter connection Miss Nightingale paid a glowing tribute to the pioneer\r\nof East-end \"settlers.\"[133] These two Papers, though they attempt to\r\ncover too much ground in a small space, abound in happy things by the\r\nway. We are told, for instance, that Matthew Arnold's _Literature and\r\nDogma_ is \"marred by a tendency not to fight like a man but to scratch\r\nlike a cat.\" The doctrine of eternal punishment is criticized in the\r\nwords of the pauper who said to his nurse after seeing the chaplain, \"It\r\ndoes seem hard to have suffered so much here, only to go to everlasting\r\ntorments hereafter.\" The creed of some contented politicians is hit off\r\nby saying that they talk of \"the 'masses,' as if they were Silurian\r\nstrata.\" The third of Miss Nightingale's Papers is the hardest to\r\ndescribe, because it is the most crowded of the series. Its practical\r\npurpose may be said in the language of later politics to be a plea for\r\n\"social reform.\" \"There must be a Chancellor of the Exchequer, and a\r\nBudget, for Morality and Crime, as for Finance.\" Her conception of\r\nsocial and moral science as an almost statistical study[134] is glanced\r\nat, and the controversy between Free Will and Necessity is disposed of\r\nby the way. Miss Nightingale sent her Papers successively to Mr. Froude.\r\nHe was delighted with the first and with the second. \"Your second Note,\"\r\nhe said, \"is even more pregnant than the first. I cannot tell how\r\nsanitary, with disordered intellects, the effects of such Papers will\r\nbe.\" They appeared in _Fraser's Magazine_ for May and July 1873. Carlyle\r\nwas not so favourably impressed. Miss Nightingale's second Paper, he\r\nsaid, was like \"a lost lamb bleating on the mountain.\" Mr. Froude's\r\ncriticism on the third was that it lacked focussing: \"the whole art of\r\ngetting culinary fire out of intellectual sunlight depends on that.\" The\r\nthird article, accordingly, was not printed. Miss Nightingale did not\r\nrelish Carlyle's remark, and her equanimity was perhaps not restored by\r\nthe domestic assurance that Florence's mistake had been in not\r\nsubmitting the manuscript to her sister's revision. One of the best\r\nthings in the Paper which was not published was a Postscript. The first\r\narticle had been widely noticed in the pulpit and the press, and had\r\nbrought to the author many letters--some sympathetic, as from Mr. Edward\r\nMaitland,[135] others sorrowfully critical. There were those who\r\npromised to pray for her conversion daily, and invited her to join them\r\nin that exercise. They had not read the article, it seemed, but only a\r\nreview of it; and among the printed critiques was one which began: \"My\r\nknowledge of the scope of this Paper is derived from the report of a\r\ndiscourse upon it.\" In her proposed Postscript Miss Nightingale took\r\n\"this opportunity of thanking unknown friends for their sympathy and\r\nsuggestions, and, still more, unknown friend-enemies for their\r\ncriticisms; but yet more should I have thanked the latter, had their\r\ncriticisms been on my poor little Article in its rough state--the\r\n'Original Cow and Snuffers'--and not on seeing the _Extract_ of a\r\n_Criticism_ of an _Extract_ of my Article. Certainly a new Art must have\r\narisen in my elderly age:--out-magazining magazining. And I hereby\r\nconfidentially inform the shade of Mr. Fraser that he may, on\r\napplication to me, see columns, closely-printed columns, of small (but\r\ncruel) print upon a Paper which the writers state that they have not\r\nread.--What! read a Paper which we are going to review!--Yes,\r\nMr. Fraser, this is what magazine-ing has come to. Articles are not even\r\nwritten on original works, even if that work be only an Article, but on\r\na Review of an Article; and not even upon that, but upon a Review of a\r\nReview of an Extract of an Article, or sometimes upon an Extract of a\r\nSermon upon an Extract of a Review of an Article. I ought to feel\r\nflattered: I try to feel flattered. But, Mr. Fraser, is life long enough\r\nfor this? is this the way to 'human progress'? And ... but as this will\r\nnot be read by my unknown critics, I come to a stop.\" The practice which\r\nMiss Nightingale thus satirised has not become less frequent in later\r\ndays when the newspapers supply their readers not with political\r\nspeeches but with opinions based on summaries of them, and when what are\r\ncalled \"educational handbooks\" aim at giving the student the power of\r\npassing a critical judgment upon authors without the necessity of\r\nreading them.\r\n\r\n  [132] In some marginalia on the _Fioretti_ of St. Francis.\r\n\r\n  [133] Edward Denison, who had died in 1870 at the age of 30.\r\n\r\n  [134] See Vol. I. p. 480.\r\n\r\n  [135] Mystical writer; author of _The Pilgrim and the Shrine_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nA few days after the appearance of Miss Nightingale's first Paper in\r\n_Fraser_, Mr. Mill died of a \"local endemic disease\" at his house near\r\nAvignon. She was profoundly moved:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Julius Mohl._) _May_ 20 [1873]. John Stuart\r\n     Mill's death was a great shock to me. Mr. Grote used to say of him\r\n     \"Talk of Mill's Logic! why he is thrilling with emotion to the very\r\n     finger-ends.\" That is just what he was. Now, speaker and subject\r\n     are both gone. He said at Mr. Grote's funeral, with an agony of\r\n     tears, \"We might have kept him 10 years longer.\" And now we say of\r\n     himself with tears \"We might have kept him for 10 years longer.\" He\r\n     was only 67. He was always urging me to publish. He used to say,\r\n     with the passion which he put into everything he did say: \"I have\r\n     no patience with people who will not publish because they think the\r\n     world is not ripe enough for their ideas: that is only conceit or\r\n     cowardice. If anybody has thought out any thing which he conceives\r\n     to be truth, in Heaven's name, let him say it!\" I did not answer\r\n     that letter. I thought that this year (I have left much of the\r\n     India and War Office work, and much of it has left me) I would\r\n     resume with John Stuart Mill and do as he told me. I put the\r\n     article in _Fraser's Magazine_ (which I now send you) to please\r\n     him. And now he is dead, and will never know that I intended to do\r\n     what he wished. He used to say, \"Tell the world what you\r\n     think--your experience. It will probably strike the world more than\r\n     anything that could be told it.\" He quoted my \"Stuff\" in his book,\r\n     which he ought not to have done.[136] I published my book on\r\n     Socrates' mother[137] partly to please him. It was a very odd\r\n     thing: it was a subject he had taken up: he was President of a\r\n     Society for _that_. When he was in England (till a fortnight before\r\n     his death) I could not find his address: I was so overwhelmed with\r\n     business and illness. I did not know he was going away. And I did\r\n     not send him this book. And now he is dead, and will never know.\r\n     But I scarcely regret his death. He was not a happy man. He was a\r\n     man who was so sure to develop very much in a future life. He had\r\n     queer religious notions: did not believe in a God or in a future\r\n     life: but believed in a sort of conflict between two Powers of Good\r\n     and Evil. I remember showing you one of his letters. And you said\r\n     it was just like Zoroaster. But he was the most _truly_ \"Liberal\"\r\n     man I ever knew. If it were for the cause of Truth that he should\r\n     be defeated, he would have _liked_ to have been defeated. And now\r\n     he is dead. And we shall never see his like again.\r\n\r\n  [136] See Vol. I. p. 471, _n._\r\n\r\n  [137] _Notes on Lying-in Institutions_; see above, p. 197.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of Miss Nightingale that she entered into\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Chadwick on the sanitary state of Mr. Mill's\r\nhouse and the climatic conditions of Provence in May. Mr. Chadwick had\r\nto put himself right in her eyes by explaining that he had not been\r\nconsulted by their friend on those subjects and had never been invited\r\nby him to Avignon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nOther literary work which occupied Miss Nightingale a good deal at this\r\ntime was undertaken either to help Mr. Jowett or in accordance with his\r\nadvice. He had urged her to work out her notion of Divine Perfection,\r\nand her theory of the Family in relation to \"sisterhoods\" and other\r\nforms of association. Miss Nightingale wrote Essays accordingly on \"What\r\nis the Evidence that there is a Perfect God?\" on \"What is the Character\r\nof God?\" and on \"Christian Fellowship as a Means to Progress.\" The gist\r\nof the latter essay may be given in a letter of an earlier date:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Benjamin Jowett._) _July_ [1870].... I think\r\n     that Faraday's idea of friendship is very high: \"One who will serve\r\n     his companion next to his God.\" And when one thinks that most, nay\r\n     almost all people have no idea of friendship at all except pleasant\r\n     juxtaposition, it strikes one with admiration. Yet is Faraday's\r\n     idea not mine. My idea of a friend is one who will and can join\r\n     you in work the sole purpose of which is to serve God. Two in one,\r\n     and one in God. It almost exactly answers Jesus Christ's words. And\r\n     so extraordinarily blessed have I been that I have had three such\r\n     friends. I can truly say that, during the 5 years that I worked\r\n     with Sidney Herbert every day and nearly all day, from the moment\r\n     he came into the room no other idea came in but that of doing the\r\n     work with the best of our powers in the service of God. (And this\r\n     tho' he was a man of the most varied and brilliant conversational\r\n     genius I have ever known--far beyond Macaulay whom I also knew.)\r\n     This is Heaven; and this is what makes me say \"I have had my\r\n     heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe two other friends with whom in former time she had been a\r\nfellow-worker were Arthur Clough and her Aunt, Mrs. Smith. Miss\r\nNightingale's other Essays led to much correspondence with Mr. Jowett,\r\nbut as they failed to come up to his standard they were laid aside. Many\r\nof her letters to him were themselves almost Essays. Extracts from one\r\nor two consecutive letters will show the kind of discussions into which\r\nMiss Nightingale loved to involve her Oxford friend, and upon which he\r\nwas nothing loath to enter:--\r\n\r\n     (_Benjamin Jowett to Miss Nightingale._) TORQUAY, _Sept._ 29\r\n     [1871].... I must answer your letter by driblets. When you admit\r\n     that a part of the witness of the character of God is to be sought\r\n     for in nature, how do you distinguish between the true and false\r\n     witness of nature? For we cannot deny that physical good is\r\n     sometimes at variance with moral--_e.g._ in marriage the sole or\r\n     chief principle ought to be health and strength in the parents\r\n     whether with or without a marriage ceremony--in other words Plato's\r\n     Republic: I mean on physical principles. Or again the laws of\r\n     physical improvement would require that we should get rid of sickly\r\n     and deformed infants. And if, as Huxley would say, you reconstruct\r\n     the world on a physical basis, you have to go to war with received\r\n     principles of morality. I suppose that the answer is you must take\r\n     man as a whole, and make morality and the mind the limit of\r\n     physical improvement. But it is not easy to see what this limit is,\r\n     because men's conceptions of morality vary, and although we may\r\n     form ideals we have to descend from them in practice. Therefore I\r\n     do not agree with you in thinking that there are no difficulties,\r\n     although the old difficulties, about origin of evil &c., are\r\n     generally a hocus of Theologians.\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Benjamin Jowett._)[138] LEA HURST, _Oct._ 3\r\n     [1871]. I am quite scandalized at your materialism. (I shall shut\r\n     up you and Plato for a hundred years in punishment in another world\r\n     till you have both obtained clearer views.) Is it for an old maid\r\n     like me to be preaching to you a Master in Israel that even \"on\r\n     physical principles\" there are essential points in marriage (to\r\n     turn out the best order of children), which, being absent, the\r\n     perfection of \"health and strength\" in both parents is of no avail\r\n     even for the physical part of the children? And might I just ask\r\n     one small question: whether you consider man has a little soul? If\r\n     he has ever such a little one, you can scarcely consider him as a\r\n     simple body, an animal, or even as a twin, the soul being one twin\r\n     and the body the other, but as all one, the soul and the body\r\n     making one being (altho' only in this sense). If you _do_, at all\r\n     events _God_ does not. And consequently He makes a great many more\r\n     things enter into the \"physical\" constitution even of the children\r\n     than the mere \"health and strength\" of the parents. (My son, really\r\n     Plato talked nonsense about this.) Take a much more material thing\r\n     than the producing of a bad or degenerate family or race. Take a\r\n     railway accident. What are the laws therein concerned? You have by\r\n     no means only to consider the \"physical\" laws--the strength of\r\n     iron, the speed of steam, the smoothness of rails, the friction\r\n     &c., &c.--but you have to consider the state of mind of Directors,\r\n     whether they care only for their dividends, so that the\r\n     railway-servants are underpaid or overworked &c., &c. You quote\r\n     Huxley. He is undoubtedly one of the prime educators of the age,\r\n     but he makes a profound mistake when he says to Mankind: objects of\r\n     sense are more worthy of your attention than your inferences and\r\n     imaginations. On the contrary, the finest powers man is gifted with\r\n     are those which enable him to infer from what he sees what he\r\n     _can't_ see. They lift him into truth of far higher import than\r\n     that which he learns from the senses alone. I believe that the laws\r\n     of nature all tend to improve the _whole_ man, moral and physical,\r\n     that it is absurd to consider man either as a body to be\r\n     \"improved,\" or as a soul to be \"improved,\" separately.\r\n\r\n     As to the \"laws of physical improvement requiring that we should\r\n     get rid of sickly and deformed infants,\" they require that we\r\n     should _prevent_ or improve, not that we should _kill_ them. _That_\r\n     would be to get rid of some of the finest intellectual and moral\r\n     specimens of our human nature that have ever existed. And, even\r\n     were this not the case, the heroism, the patience, the wisdom of\r\n     our race have been more called forth by dealing with these and the\r\n     like forms of evil than by almost anything else. The good of man in\r\n     its highest sense cannot be attained by neglecting one set of laws\r\n     or one aspect of man's nature and cultivating another.\r\n\r\n     I entirely therefore agree that \"you must take man as a whole.\" But\r\n     this seems at variance with a celebrated author's next sentence\r\n     \"and make morality and the mind the _limit_ of physical\r\n     improvement.\" If I were writing, I should use a word signifying the\r\n     exact reverse; not limit, but expansion, enlargement,\r\n     multiplication, master or informing spirit. As Plato says: the mind\r\n     informs the body, owns the body, the body is the servant of the\r\n     mind. How can the owner and the master be the limit? We must really\r\n     pray for your conversion....\r\n\r\n     (_Benjamin Jowett to Miss Nightingale._) TORQUAY, _Oct._ 4.... What\r\n     have I said to deserve such an outburst? I have no wish to shake\r\n     the foundation of Society. What I think about these matters is\r\n     feebly expressed in a part of Essay at the end of the introduction\r\n     to the _Republic_. But when I come to a second edition I will\r\n     express it better.\r\n\r\n  [138] I have somewhat compressed the argument in this letter.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the passage in the first and second editions of\r\nMr. Jowett's Introduction respectively[139] shows how largely he\r\nprofited by the criticisms in the foregoing letter. His _Plato_ first\r\nappeared in 1871, and at once he began revising it. In this work Miss\r\nNightingale gave him great help. Her Greek had now grown a little\r\nrusty,[140] but her interest in the substance of Plato was intense. She\r\nannotated Mr. Jowett's summaries and introductions very closely, and\r\nsent him voluminous suggestions for revision. \"You are the best critic,\"\r\nhe wrote, \"whom I ever had.\" Several of Miss Nightingale's notes are\r\npreserved, in rough copy, amongst her Papers, and by means of them her\r\nhand may be traced in many a page of Mr. Jowett's revised work. In the\r\nfirst edition of the introduction to the _Republic_ he made some remarks\r\non love as a motive in poetry which excited Miss Nightingale's strong\r\ndisapproval. She agreed that \"the illusion of the feelings commonly\r\ncalled love\" was a motive of which too much had been made; but the\r\npoets, she thought, had as yet hardly touched the theme of true\r\nlove--\"two in one, and one in God\"--as an incentive to heroic action.\r\n\"The philosopher may be excused,\" Mr. Jowett had written, \"if he\r\nimagines an age when poetry and sentiment have disappeared, and truth\r\nhas taken the place of imagination, and the feelings of love are\r\nunderstood and estimated at their proper value.\" \"Take out that mean\r\ncalumny, my son,\" wrote Miss Nightingale; \"take it out this minute;\r\nblaspheme not against Love.\" The offending sentence was expunged in the\r\nsecond edition. Mr. Jowett had gone on to \"blaspheme\" a little against\r\nArt, citing the Mahommedans as a case of the state of the human mind in\r\nwhich \"all artistic representations are regarded as a false and\r\nimperfect expression either of the religious or of the philosophical\r\nideal.\" Miss Nightingale objected that the Mahommedans had renounced the\r\nuse of pictures and images, but not of architecture: \"Mosques are the\r\nhighest kind of art: the one true representation of the One God: the\r\nGlory of God in the highest: the most high of the Most High: higher than\r\nany Christian art or architecture--as you would say if you had seen the\r\nmosques of Cairo.\" Mr. Jowett recast his passage, and used Miss\r\nNightingale's illustration, almost in her words.[141] \"I am always\r\nstealing from you,\" he said. On his Introduction to the _Gorgias_, she\r\nmade an interesting criticism:--\r\n\r\n     Is not Socrates more ineffably tiresome, and at the same time does\r\n     he not speak higher truth, in the _Gorgias_ than anywhere else? Why\r\n     call these higher truths \"paradoxes\"? Are not your sermons always a\r\n     sort of apology for talking to them of God? And why should your\r\n     Introductions be a sort of apology for recognizing that Socrates\r\n     speaks the highest truth and no paradox? Have guarded statements,\r\n     whether about God or any particular moral or truth, ever produced\r\n     enthusiasm of religion or in morality? Is there any Dialogue, not\r\n     even excepting the _Phaedo_ and _Crito_, where he is so much in\r\n     earnest? He is so terribly in earnest that towards the end he even\r\n     throws all his dialectic aside, and makes even Polus in earnest. To\r\n     me, speaking as one of the stupid and ignorant, it seems that your\r\n     Introduction dwells too much on the _form_ of the _Gorgias_ and does\r\n     not bring out in sufficiently striking relief the great truths which\r\n     Socrates labours so strenuously to enforce that he almost seems to\r\n     lose himself in them. These great moral truths are (are they\r\n     not?):--(1) _It is a greater evil to do than to suffer injustice._ If\r\n     you call this a \"paradox,\" why do you not call the 53rd Chapter of\r\n     Isaiah a paradox? Is it not the highest of truths? (2) _It is a\r\n     greater evil not to be punished than to be punished for wrong._ I have\r\n     no idea why you call this a paradox. It follows from all the higher\r\n     experience of the life of every one of us. In family life I see it\r\n     every day. I see the \"spoilt child\" making himself, and oftener\r\n     herself, and everyone else miserable, down to mature life or extreme\r\n     old age. (Tho' the \"punishments\" of my life have been somewhat severe,\r\n     yet I can bless God, even in this world, that never in all my life\r\n     have I been allowed to \"do as I liked.\") ...\r\n\r\n  [139] See _first_ edition, vol. ii. p. 145, and _second_ edition,\r\n        vol. iii. pp. 161-162.\r\n\r\n  [140] On one occasion she forgot the Greek for \"Limitless,\" and asked\r\n        Mr. Jowett to tell her. He replied by quoting Homer:\r\n        \"[Greek: amoton memauia], raging insatiably or without limit\"--\r\n        adding wickedly \"Whom did this represent?\"\r\n\r\n  [141] See _second_ edition, vol. iii. p. 145.\r\n\r\nIf the reader cares to take this passage to a comparison of the second\r\nwith the first edition of Mr. Jowett's Introduction,[142] he will\r\ndiscover again how largely, and closely, Miss Nightingale's criticisms\r\nwere accepted. She dealt similarly--giving precise references for every\r\nstatement--with the greater part of the Dialogues. \"In the _Phaedrus_,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Jowett (July 22, 1873), \"I have put in most of what you\r\nsuggested and made some additions. You are quite right in thinking that\r\nI should get as much modern truth into the Introductions as possible. It\r\nis a great opportunity; which I have had in view, but not so clearly as\r\nsince you wrote to me.\"\r\n\r\n  [142] The references are: _first_ edition, vol. iii. pp. 26 _seq._;\r\n        _second_ edition, vol. ii. pp. 302 _seq._\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale continued, as in former years, to send Mr. Jowett\r\nsuggestions for sermons. \"I have written part of your sermon,\" he wrote,\r\nwhen she had sent him an outline of what she would like him to preach\r\nfrom the University pulpit. When he became Master of Balliol he\r\nprojected a Special Form for daily service in the College Chapel, and\r\nMiss Nightingale suggested a selection of passages from the Psalms under\r\nthe heads of \"God the Lord,\" \"God the Judge,\" \"God the Father,\" \"God the\r\nFriend,\" \"the Way of the Cross,\" and so forth. Mr. Jowett had, however,\r\nto abandon the project in deference to superior authority.[143] Another\r\nscheme was carried out. In 1873 an edition of the Bible appeared which\r\nhas a history of some interest. _The School and Children's Bible_ it was\r\ncalled; the name of the Rev. William Rogers, of Bishopsgate, appears on\r\nthe title-page, but the selection was in fact made for the most part by\r\nMr. Jowett, with the help of some of his friends.[144] That\r\nMr. Swinburne was one of these friends, we know from the poet's own\r\nrecollections; it is not generally known that the other principal\r\ncollaborator with Mr. Jowett was Miss Nightingale. Mr. Swinburne's help\r\nwas in one respect disappointing. \"I wanted you,\" said Mr. Jowett to him\r\nwith a smile, \"to help me to make this book smaller, and you have\r\npersuaded me to make it much larger.\" The poet, who was complimented on\r\nhis thorough familiarity with sundry parts of the sacred text, thought\r\nthat Mr. Jowett had excluded too much of the prophetic and poetic\r\nelements, not taking into account \"the delight that a child may take in\r\nthings beyond the grasp of his perfect comprehension, though not beyond\r\nthe touch of his apprehensive or prehensile faculty.\" Miss Nightingale,\r\nwhose familiarity with the Bible was probably even closer and more\r\nextensive than Mr. Swinburne's and with whom Biblical criticism was a\r\nfavourite study, also wanted a great deal put in which Mr. Jowett had\r\nleft out, but her instinct for edification led her to suggest equivalent\r\nomissions. She took great pains with her suggestions, illustrating them\r\nin letters to Mr. Jowett with many characteristic remarks by the way:--\r\n\r\n     It is impossible to keep up acquaintance with a man, however\r\n     otherwise estimable, who separates the 26 last chapters of Isaiah\r\n     from Isaiah merely by a shabby little note and asterisk. Surely\r\n     those chapters belong to the end of the Babylonish Captivity and\r\n     should be separated by a distinct division; while the shabby little\r\n     note and asterisk might go to some isolated chapters (_e.g._ xiii.,\r\n     xiv.) among the first 39 which belong to the same time, the end of\r\n     the Captivity--whereas the first 39 chapters (generally) appear to\r\n     belong to the \"Middle Ages\" of Prophecy. But as it may be judged\r\n     inconvenient to put Chaps. xl.-lxvi. of Isaiah in a different part\r\n     of the Bible, I will concede that point and simply classify them (I\r\n     follow Ewald's order). But they _must_ be under a separate Heading\r\n     with \"End of Babylonian Captivity\" (or words to that effect)\r\n     printed distinctly _under the heading_ (not in a note).\r\n\r\n  [143] \"The Bishop has disallowed our 'Versicles' and some other things\r\n        on legal grounds--_i.e._ on the opinion of Sir Travers Twiss (poor\r\n        man!). We will have them in a particular book of our own. He says\r\n        'they are admirably selected'\" (_Letter from Mr. Jowett_, March 16,\r\n        1872).\r\n\r\n  [144] See Abbott and Campbell's _Life and Letters of Jowett_, vol. ii.\r\n        pp. 35-36, and \"Recollections of Professor Jowett\" in Swinburne's\r\n        _Studies in Prose and Poetry_, p. 33. The full title of the book\r\n        was _The School and Children's Bible prepared under the\r\n        Superintendence of the Rev. William Rogers_. London: Longmans,\r\n        1873.\r\n\r\nMore generally, she criticized the first selection sent to her as\r\nshowing some want of proportion. There was no clear plan, she thought,\r\nas to the space to be given, respectively, to:--\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Matters of _universal_ importance, moral and spiritual\r\n     (_e.g._ the finest parts of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the New\r\n     Testament); (_b_) matters of _historical_ importance (_e.g._ which\r\n     embrace the history of great nations, Egypt, Assyria, Babylon. The\r\n     petty wars of the petty tribes seem to take up a quite\r\n     disproportionate space); (_c_) matters of _local_ importance, which\r\n     have acquired a _universal moral_ significance (_e.g._ Jonah is\r\n     entirely left out: yet Jonah has a moral and spiritual meaning,\r\n     while Samson, Balaam and Bathsheba have none); (_d_) matters of\r\n     _merely local_ importance, with no significance but an _immoral_\r\n     one (_e.g._ the stories about Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, almost all\r\n     Joshua and Judges, and very much of Samuel and Kings). The story of\r\n     Achilles and his horses is far more fit for children than that of\r\n     Balaam and his ass, which is only fit to be told to asses. The\r\n     stories of Samson and of Jephthah are only fit to be told to\r\n     bull-dogs; and the story of Bathsheba, to be told to Bathshebas.\r\n     Yet we give all these stories to children as \"Holy Writ.\" There are\r\n     some things in Homer we might better call \"Holy\" Writ--many, many\r\n     in Sophocles and Aeschylus. The stories about Andromache and\r\n     Antigone are worth all the women in the Old Testament put together;\r\n     nay, almost all the women in the Bible.\r\n\r\n\"I have just finished the Children's Bible,\" wrote Mr. Jowett (Feb. 10,\r\n1872). \"I blessed you every time I took the papers up, especially in the\r\nProphets. I have adopted your selection almost entirely, with a slight\r\nabridgement, and it is further approved by Mr. Cheyne's authority.\"\r\n\r\nThese various literary enterprises, undertaken at Mr. Jowett's instance,\r\noccupied a great deal of Miss Nightingale's time--more time, as she\r\nsometimes said to herself, than could rightly be spared from primary\r\nduties; and the time was spent, she added in her self-reproaches, to\r\nlittle purpose. In some respects Mr. Jowett's suggestions to her were\r\nnot very happy. One cannot elaborate in a consecutive form a Scheme of\r\nTheology or a Social Philosophy, even through the medium of essays, in\r\nodd hours as a bye-work. So Miss Nightingale soon found, and the failure\r\nweighed heavily on her spirits; but Mr. Jowett did not realize how great\r\nwas the strain upon his friend's faculties involved in her nursing work,\r\nnor how much time, effort, and emotion she was devoting, though \"out of\r\noffice,\" to the complicated problems of Indian administration. We, who\r\nhave access to her Papers, shall learn the full extent of these\r\npreoccupations in later chapters (III. and IV.). But something must\r\nfirst be said of another literary enterprise. To it Miss Nightingale's\r\nclose study of the Bible and of Plato was entirely relevant. Such\r\nstudies were, as we shall find in the next chapter, part of the food\r\nwhich sustained her inner life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                             THE MYSTICAL WAY\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mysticism: to dwell on the unseen, to withdraw ourselves from the\r\n     things of sense into communion with God--to endeavour to partake of\r\n     the Divine nature; that is, of Holiness. When we ask ourselves only\r\n     what is right, or what is the will of God (the same question), then\r\n     we may truly be said to live in His light.--FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned incidentally in an earlier chapter that Miss\r\nNightingale was fond of reading the books of Catholic devotion which the\r\nReverend Mother of the Bermondsey Convent used to send her. Long before,\r\nshe had studied carefully the writings of the Port Royalists; and at the\r\nTrinità de' Monti she had seen the ideal of Catholic devotion in real\r\nlife. She used to pass on some of her devotional works to Mr. Jowett. He\r\nbegan with St. Teresa, and, at first repelled, he gradually became\r\ninterested. Miss Nightingale was in the habit of copying out passages\r\nfor her own edification, sometimes in the original, sometimes\r\ntranslating them. The idea of making a selection for publication\r\noccurred to her, and Mr. Jowett encouraged it. \"Do not give up your\r\nidea,\" he said, \"of making a selection of the better mind of the Middle\r\nAges and the Mystics.\" \"You will do a good work,\" he wrote again (Oct.\r\n3, 1872), \"if you point out the kind of mysticism which is needed in the\r\npresent day--not mysticism at all, but as intense a feeling, as the\r\nmystics had, of the power of truth and reason and of the will of God\r\nthat they should take effect in the world. The passion of the reason,\r\nthe fusion of faith and reason, the reason in religion and the religion\r\nin reason--if you can only describe these, you will teach people a new\r\nlesson. The new has something still to learn from the old; and I am not\r\ncertain whether we ought not to retire into mysticism (I thought I\r\nshould not use the word) when the antagonism with existing opinions\r\nbecomes too great.\" Miss Nightingale's close study of Plato and of the\r\nBible, described in the last chapter, increased her interest in\r\nChristian mysticism. The Fourth Gospel was the work of a mystic. And\r\nthere were curious analogies, which she pointed out to Mr. Jowett,[145]\r\nbetween Plato and the mediæval mystics. The famous myth of the purified\r\nsoul, for instance, recalled a passage in the _Fioretti_ of St. Francis,\r\nexcept that there the purgatorial stage, before the \"wings grow,\" lasts\r\n150 years, instead of 10,000. Miss Nightingale said of the closing\r\nprayer in the _Phaedrus_--\"Give me beauty in the inward soul, and may\r\nthe outward and inward man be at one\"--a prayer unequalled, she thought,\r\nby any Collect in the service-book--that it \"put in seventeen words the\r\nwhole, or at least half, of the doctrine of St. John of the Cross.\"\r\nPlato made her the more interested in the Christian Mystics; the\r\nChristian Mystics, the more interested in Plato. Concurrently with her\r\nwork for Mr. Jowett's revised _Plato_ she gave much time during 1873 and\r\n1874 (with additions in later years) to transcribing or translating and\r\narranging passages from devotional writers of the Middle Ages. She had\r\nsent some of her book in various stages to Mr. Jowett, who, with other\r\nsuggestions, said (April 18, 1873) that she ought to add \"a Preface\r\nshowing the use of such books. They are apt to appear unreal, and yet\r\nThomas à Kempis has been one of the most influential books in the world.\r\nThe subject of the Preface should be the use of the ideal and especially\r\nthe spiritual ideal. I do not say what may be the case with great Saints\r\nthemselves, but for us I think it is clear that this mystic state ought\r\nto be an occasional and not a permanent feeling--a taste of heaven in\r\ndaily life. Do you think it would be possible to write a mystical book\r\nwhich would also be the essence of Common Sense?\"\r\n\r\n  [145] He made use of her suggestion in a postscript (in the _second_\r\n        edition) to his Introduction to the _Phaedrus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nI construct the Preface from various notes and rough drafts in Miss\r\nNightingale's hand:--\r\n\r\n     It may seem a strange thing to begin a book with:--this Book is not\r\n     for any one who has time to read it--but the meaning of it is: this\r\n     reading is good only as a preparation for work. If it is not to\r\n     inspire life and work, it is bad. Just as the end of food is to\r\n     enable us to live and work, and not to live and eat, so the end\r\n     of--most reading perhaps, but certainly of--mystical reading is not\r\n     to read but to work.\r\n\r\n     For what is Mysticism? Is it not the attempt to draw near to God,\r\n     not by rites or ceremonies, but by inward disposition? Is it not\r\n     merely a hard word for \"The Kingdom of Heaven is within\"? Heaven is\r\n     neither a place nor a time. There might be a Heaven not only _here_\r\n     but _now_. It is true that sometimes we must sacrifice not only\r\n     health of body, but health of mind (or, peace) in the interest of\r\n     God; that is, we must sacrifice Heaven. But \"thou shalt be like God\r\n     for thou shalt see Him as He is\": this may be _here_ and _now_, as\r\n     well as _there_ and _then_. And it may be for a time--then\r\n     lost--then recovered--both _here_ and _there_, both _now_ and\r\n     _then_.\r\n\r\n     That Religion is not devotion, but work and suffering for the love\r\n     of God; this is the true doctrine of Mystics--as is more\r\n     particularly set forth in a definition of the 16th century: \"True\r\n     religion is to have no other will but God's.\" Compare this with the\r\n     definition of Religion in Johnson's _Dictionary_: \"Virtue founded\r\n     upon reverence of God and expectation of future rewards and\r\n     punishments\"; in other words on respect and self-interest, not\r\n     love. Imagine the religion which inspired the life of Christ\r\n     \"founded\" on the motives given by Dr. Johnson!\r\n\r\n     Christ Himself was the first true Mystic. \"My meat is to do the\r\n     will of Him that sent me and to finish His work.\" What is this but\r\n     putting in fervent and the most striking words the foundation of\r\n     all real Mystical Religion?--which is that for all our actions, all\r\n     our words, all our thoughts, the food upon which they are to live\r\n     and have their being is to be the indwelling Presence of God, the\r\n     union with God; that is, with the Spirit of Goodness and Wisdom.\r\n\r\n     Where shall I find God? In myself. That is the true Mystical\r\n     Doctrine. But then I myself must be in a state for Him to come and\r\n     dwell in me. This is the whole aim of the Mystical Life; and all\r\n     Mystical Rules in all times and countries have been laid down for\r\n     putting the soul into such a state. That the soul herself should be\r\n     heaven, that our Father which is in heaven should dwell in her, that\r\n     there is something within us infinitely more estimable than often\r\n     comes out, that God enlarges this \"palace of our soul\" by degrees so\r\n     as to enable her to receive Himself, that thus he gives her liberty\r\n     but that the soul must give herself up absolutely to Him for Him to\r\n     do this, the incalculable benefit of this occasional but frequent\r\n     intercourse with the Perfect: this is the conclusion and sum of the\r\n     whole matter, put into beautiful language by the Mystics. And of\r\n     this process they describe the steps, and assign periods of months\r\n     and years during which the steps, they say, are commonly made by\r\n     those who make them at all.\r\n\r\n     These old Mystics whom we call superstitious were far before us in\r\n     their ideas of God and of prayer (that is of our communion with\r\n     God). \"Prayer,\" says a mystic of the 16th century, \"is to ask not\r\n     what we wish of God, but what God wishes of us.\" \"Master who hast\r\n     made and formed the vessel of the body of Thy creature, and hast\r\n     put within so great a treasure, the Soul, which bears the image of\r\n     Thee\": so begins a dying prayer of the 14th century. In it and in\r\n     the other prayers of the Mystics there is scarcely a petition.\r\n     There is never a word of the theory that God's dealings with us are\r\n     to show His \"power\"; still less of the theory that \"of His own good\r\n     pleasure\" He has \"predestined\" any souls to eternal damnation.\r\n     There is little mention of heaven for self; of desire of happiness\r\n     for self, none. It is singular how little mention there is either\r\n     of \"intercession\" or of \"Atonement by Another's merits.\" True it is\r\n     that we can only _create_ a heaven for _ourselves and others_ \"by\r\n     the merits of Another,\" since it is only by working in accordance\r\n     with God's Laws that we can do anything. But there is nothing at\r\n     all in these prayers as if God's anger had to be bought off, as if\r\n     He had to be bribed into giving us heaven by sufferings merely \"to\r\n     satisfy God's justice.\" In the dying prayers, there is nothing of\r\n     the \"egotism of death.\" It is the reformation of God's church--that\r\n     is, God's children, for whom the self would give itself, that\r\n     occupies the dying thoughts. There is not often a desire to be\r\n     released from trouble and suffering. On the contrary, there is\r\n     often a desire to suffer the greatest suffering, and to offer the\r\n     greatest offering, with even greater pain, if so any work can be\r\n     done. And still, this, and all, is ascribed to God's _goodness_.\r\n     The offering is not to buy anything by suffering, but--If only the\r\n     suppliant can do anything for God's children!\r\n\r\n     These suppliants did not live to see the \"reformation\" of God's\r\n     children. No more will any who now offer these prayers. But at\r\n     least we can all work towards such practical \"reformation.\" The way\r\n     to live with God is to live with Ideas--not merely to think about\r\n     ideals, but to do and suffer for them. Those who have to work on men\r\n     and women must above all things have their Spiritual Ideal, their\r\n     purpose, ever present. The \"mystical\" state is the essence of common\r\n     sense.\r\n\r\nThe authors whom Miss Nightingale read for the purpose of her selection\r\nincluded St. Angela of Foligno, Madame de Chatel, St. Francis of Assisi,\r\nSt. Francis Xavier, St. John of the Cross, Peter of Alcantara, Father\r\nRigoleuc, St. Teresa, and Father Surin. She arranged her extracts from\r\nthese and other writers under headings, and supplied marginal summaries.\r\nShe prepared also a title-page:--_Notes from Devotional Authors of the\r\nMiddle Ages, Collected, Chosen, and Freely Translated by Florence\r\nNightingale_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThis and all other literary work was interrupted, however, at the\r\nbeginning of 1874 by the death of her father. She was in London; her\r\nsister and Sir Harry Verney were with him and Mrs. Nightingale at\r\nEmbley. He was 80; but, though his strength of body and mind had failed\r\na little, he had been out for his usual ride a few days before. Lady\r\nVerney had wished him good-night. \"Say not good-night,\" he said in\r\nreply, quoting Mrs. Barbauld, \"but in some brighter clime Bid me\r\ngood-morning.\" A day or two later, he came down to breakfast as usual,\r\nbut found that he had forgotten his watch. He went to fetch it, slipped\r\nupon the stairs, and died on the spot. Miss Nightingale felt the loss of\r\nher father deeply. \"His reverent love for you,\" wrote Lord Houghton in a\r\nletter of condolence (Jan. 13, 1874), \"was inexpressibly touching,\" and\r\nher love for him, though of a different kind, was very tender. Unlike in\r\nmany respects, father and daughter were yet kindred spirits in\r\nintellectual curiosity, in a taste for speculative inquiry. M. Mohl\r\nnoted among Mr. Nightingale's engaging characteristics \"a modest\r\ncuriosity about everything, a surprised, innocent, incredulous smile as\r\nhe listened intently.\" Miss Irby spoke of his \"exceeding sweetness and\r\nchildlikeness of wisdom.\" These qualities were conspicuous in much\r\nof his intercourse with his daughter Florence, and she was now deprived\r\nof the father who had, in things of the mind, sat at her feet and\r\nsympathized in her searches after truth. The death of her father was\r\nquickly followed, on January 31, 1874, by that of her dearly loved\r\nfriend, Mrs. Bracebridge. \"She was more than mother to me,\" wrote\r\nFlorence to M. and Madame Mohl (Feb. 3); \"and oh that I could not be a\r\ndaughter to her in her last sad days! What should I have been without\r\nher? and what would many have been without her? To one living with her\r\nas I did once, she was unlike any other human being: as unlike as a\r\npicture of a sunny scene is to the real light and warmth of sunshine: or\r\nas this February lamp we call our sun is to her own Sun of living light\r\nin Greece.... Other people live together to make each other worse: she\r\nlived with all to make them better. And she was not like a chastened\r\nChristian saint: no more like that than Apollo; but she had qualities\r\nwhich no Greek God ever had--real humility (excepting my dear Father, I\r\nnever knew any one so really humble), and with it the most active heart\r\nand mind and buoyant soul that could well be conceived.\" Mr. Bracebridge\r\nhad died eighteen months before (July 18, 1872), and Miss Nightingale\r\nhad said: \"He and she have been the creators of my life. And when I\r\nthink of him at Scutari, the only man in all England who would have\r\nlived with willingness such a pigging life, without the interest and\r\nresponsibility which it had to me, I think that we shall never look upon\r\nhis like again. And when I think of Atherstone, of Athens, of all the\r\nplaces I have been in with them, of the immense influence they had in\r\nshaping my own life--more than earthly father and mother to me--I cannot\r\ndoubt that they leave behind them, having shaped many lives as they did\r\nmine, their mark on the century--this century which has so little ideal\r\nat least in England. They were so immeasurably above any English\r\n'country gentry' I have ever known.\" Miss Nightingale's estimate of her\r\nfriends was shared by others who had enjoyed their hospitality. \"The\r\ndeath of Mrs. Bracebridge,\" wrote M. Mohl (Feb. 14), \"is a sad blow for\r\nyou. The breaking of these old associations which nothing new can\r\nreplace impoverishes one's life, and a part of ourselves dies out with\r\nold friends even if they have not been to us what Mrs. Bracebridge was\r\nto you. _Und immer stiller wird's und stiller auf unserm Pfad_ until the\r\ngreat problem of life opens for ourselves. Two better people than the\r\nBracebridges, different as they were, I have never seen. Madame\r\nd'Abbadie has a queer expression for a woman she approves of; she says\r\n_elle est honnête homme_, and nothing is more appropriate to Mrs.\r\nBracebridge. I can never think of Atherstone without emotion; it is\r\npeople like these in whom lies the glory of England and the strength of\r\nthe country. They were so genuine, so ready to help and to impoverish\r\nthemselves for public purposes, and to do it unostentatiously and\r\nwithout fishing for popularity.\" To the end of her life Miss Nightingale\r\ncherished the memory of these faithful and helpful friends. \"To my\r\nbeloved and revered friends,\" she said in her Will, \"Mr. Charles\r\nBracebridge and his wife, my more than mother, without whom Scutari and\r\nmy life could not have been, and to whom nothing that I could ever say\r\nor do would in the least express my thankfulness, I should have left\r\nsome token of my remembrance had they, as I expected, survived me.\" The\r\ndeath of her companion at Scutari removed one of the few links with Miss\r\nNightingale's happier past. The death of her father was not only a\r\nbereavement which she felt deeply; it also involved her in much\r\ndistracting business. Her father's landed properties, at Embley and Lea\r\nHurst, now passed, under the entail, to his sister, \"Aunt Mai,\" and her\r\nhusband. Florence did not attend her father's funeral, but soon she went\r\ndown to Embley to look after her mother. There, and afterwards in\r\nLondon, she was immersed in worrying affairs. Her only comfort, she\r\nwrote repeatedly in private notes, was the \"goodness\" of Mr. Shore\r\nSmith--\"her boy\" of old days. The letters of Mr. Coltman, one of her\r\nfather's executors, were full of humour, but Florence was never able to\r\ntake things lightly. There were questions of property and residence to\r\nbe discussed; servants to be dismissed and engaged; her mother's\r\nimmediate movements and future mode of life to be settled. Everybody had\r\na different plan, and Florence complained that nobody but she had the\r\nsame plan for two days running. Her letters and notes at this period\r\nare of a quite tragic intensity. Something may be ascribed to a\r\ncharacteristic over-emphasis. \"We Smiths,\" she said once of herself,\r\n\"all exaggerate\"; and Mr. Jowett said of some remarks made by her about\r\nhim: \"You are as nearly right as an habitual spirit of exaggeration will\r\never allow you to be.\" \"We are a great many too many strong characters,\"\r\nshe wrote of herself and her family, \"and very different: all pulling\r\ndifferent ways. And we are so dreadfully _au sérieux_. Oh, how much good\r\nit does us to have some one to laugh at us!\"\r\n\r\nBut there was no exaggeration in one of her woes. A third of her time\r\nwas taken up with the Nightingale Nurses; another third with Indian\r\naffairs (for in relation to India, as we shall hear, she never quite\r\n\"went out of office\"); the remaining third, which might have been\r\ndevoted to working out a scheme of social and moral science on the\r\nstatistical methods of M. Quetelet, or on preparing for the press her\r\nselections from the Mystics, was being wasted in family worries. M.\r\nQuetelet, with whom she had been corresponding, had recently died. \"I\r\ncannot say,\" she wrote to Dr. Farr (Feb. 23, 1874), \"how the death of\r\nour old friend touches me: he was the founder of the most important\r\nscience in the whole world. Some months ago I prepared the first sketch\r\nof an Essay I meant to publish and dedicate to him on the application of\r\nhis discoveries to explain the Plan of God in teaching us by these\r\nresults the laws by which our Moral Progress is to be attained. I had\r\npleased myself with thinking that this would please him. But painful and\r\nindispensable business prevented the finishing of my paper.\" \"O God,\"\r\nshe exclaimed in the bitterness of her heart, \"let me not sink in these\r\nperplexities: but give me a great cause to do and die for.\" And again:\r\n\"What makes the difference between man and woman? Quetelet did his work,\r\nand I am so disturbed by my family that I can't do mine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nSo, then, Miss Nightingale never finished her book on the Mystics; but\r\nshe did something which, if we take her view of literary work, we may\r\naccount far better; she lived it. No words of Florence Nightingale's\r\nthat have been quoted in the course of this Memoir are more intensely\r\nautobiographical, none express more truly the spirit in which she lived\r\nand moved and had her being, than those which I have put together on a\r\npreceding page from her Notes on the Mystics. Her creed may seem cold to\r\nsome minds, but she invested it with a spiritual fervour which none of\r\nthe Mystics has surpassed. This woman, so practical, so business-like,\r\nand in her outward dealings with men and affairs so worldly-wise, was a\r\ndreamer, a devotee, a religious enthusiast. The Lady-in-Chief, who was\r\nto others a tower of strength, was to herself a weak vessel, praying\r\ncontinually for support, and conscious, with bitter intensity, of\r\nshort-coming, of faithlessness, of rebellion to the will of God.\r\nSelf-possessed in the presence of others, she was tortured and agonized,\r\noften to the verge of despair, in the solitude of her chamber. \"I have\r\ndone nothing for seven years,\" she said to a friend, \"but write\r\nregulations.\" And that was broadly true of one side of her life. Of\r\nanother side, she might have said with almost equal truth, \"I have done\r\nnothing all my life but write spiritual meditations.\" She lived with a\r\npen or pencil ever at her side; and reams of her paper are covered with\r\nconfessions, self-examinations, communings with God. She suffered much,\r\nand especially during these years, from sleeplessness, and in the\r\nwatches of the night she would turn to read the Mystics for comfort, or\r\nto write on her tablets for spiritual exercise. Though she liked best\r\nthe books of the Catholic saints, her Catholicism was wider than theirs,\r\nand she could find spiritual kinship also, as in the lines prefixed to\r\nthe present Part, with the hymns of American evangelists. At one and the\r\nsame time mystic and practical administrator, Miss Nightingale had two\r\nsoul-sides; but each was a reflection of the other. Her religion was her\r\nwork; and her work was her religion. She read the Mystics, not to lull\r\nher active faculties into contemplative ecstasy, but to consecrate them\r\nto more perfect service. In one place she makes these notes from St.\r\nCatherine of Siena:--\"It is not the occupation but the spirit which\r\nmakes the difference. The election of a bishop may be a most secular\r\nthing. The election of a representative may be a religious thing. It is\r\nnot the preluding such an election with public prayer that would make it\r\na religious act. It is religious so far as each man discharges his part\r\nas a duty and a solemn responsibility. The question is not whether a\r\nthing is done for the State or the Church, but whether it is done with\r\nGod or without God.\" Miss Nightingale's heading to this passage was\r\n\"Drains.\" She applied her religion to every aspect of her life; and in\r\nher meditations, passages of solemn profundity are sometimes side by\r\nside with entries of a quaint, and almost humorous, directness, like a\r\ngargoyle above a church porch or a dog in a Madonna picture. \"O Lord I\r\noffer him to Thee. He is so _heavy_. Do Thou take care of him. _I_\r\ncan't.\" \"I must strive to see only God in my friends, and God in my\r\ncats.\" Such passages are thought \"profane\" by professors of a purely\r\nformal religion; but are characteristic of the true mystics in all\r\ndenominations.\r\n\r\nThe mystical self-abasement of the Saints was never more complete than\r\nin the private meditations of Florence Nightingale. Once in the middle\r\nof the night she started up and saw pictures on the wall by the\r\nnight-light lamp. \"Am I she who once stood on that Crimean height? 'The\r\nLady with a Lamp shall stand.' The lamp shows me only my utter\r\nshipwreck.\" From the year 1872 onwards, when she went \"out of office,\"\r\nand with increased intensity after her father's death, Miss\r\nNightingale's mood, in all communings with herself, was of deep\r\ndejection and of utter humbleness. The notes are often heart-rending in\r\ntheir impression of loneliness, of craving for sympathy which she could\r\nnot find, of bitter self-reproach. The loss of friends may account for\r\nsomething of all this, and even her friendship with Mr. Jowett had now\r\nlost somewhat of its consoling power. She felt that she gave more\r\nsympathy than she received; she sometimes found her interviews with him\r\nexhausting or disturbing; \"he talks to me,\" she said once, \"as if I were\r\nsome one else.\" The strange manner of her life should be remembered. Her\r\nhabit of seeing only one person at a time, and that at set times, must\r\nhave made intercourse rather formidable for both parties. Nobody, even\r\nif staying in the house, ever _happened_ to come into her room, and no\r\noutside visitor appeared unexpectedly. She never had the relief of\r\nhearing two other people talk, or of witnessing, even for a moment, two\r\nother personalities in contact. Something too must be accounted to the\r\nfact that many of her meditations were written at night or in the early\r\nmorning hours when she could not sleep. Periods of sleepless dejection,\r\nwhich in the lives of most men and women leave little record of\r\nthemselves behind, were by her spent in writing down their weary tale.\r\nNo doubt, the self-expression gave relief; and she would often turn at\r\nthe instant from her tablets of despair to amuse a visitor with humorous\r\nconversation, or write a vivacious letter to a friend.\r\n\r\nThese are considerations for which allowance must be made in estimating\r\nwhat was morbid in Miss Nightingale's moods. But for the most part the\r\ndespondency and the self-abasement which coloured her meditations, and\r\nwhich sometimes appear in her letters, were the expression of the\r\nmystical way of her soul. They are the utterance of a soul which was\r\nstriving after perfection, and found the path difficult and thorny. Miss\r\nNightingale was masterful and eager; she had often been able to impress\r\nher will upon men and upon events; she found it difficult to bear\r\ndisappointments and vexations with that entire resignation which the\r\nmystics taught her. She was \"out of office\"; she had been interrupted,\r\nsuddenly and painfully, in a long career of almost unceasing action. The\r\npause in her public life gave her new occasion for self-criticism and\r\nfresh consciousness of the difficulty of sustaining in active life that\r\nabsolute purity of motive which makes light even of success or failure.\r\nShe strove to attain, and she taught others to ensue, passivity in\r\naction--to do the utmost in their power, but to leave the result to a\r\nHigher Power. In a poem which gave her much comfort in later years she\r\nmarked this passage:--\r\n\r\n            Abstaining from attachment to the work,\r\n            Abstaining from rewardment in the work,\r\n            While yet one doeth it full faithfully,\r\n            Saying, \"'Tis right to do!\"--that is true act\r\n            And abstinence! Who doeth duties so,\r\n            Unvexed if his work fail, if it succeed\r\n            Unflattered, in his own heart justified,\r\n            Quit of debates and doubts, his is \"true\" act.[146]\r\n\r\n  [146] Sir Edwin Arnold's _The Song Celestial_ (translated from the\r\n        Mahâbhârata): see below, p. 401.\r\n\r\nBut the lesson was hard to learn. \"There are trying days before us,\" she\r\nwrote to one of her dearest friends (Aug. 1873); \"however, we cannot\r\nchange a single 'hair'; we must look to Him 'Alike who grasps eternity,\r\nAnd numbers every hair.' I don't know that it is ever difficult to me to\r\nentrust my 'hair' to Him, but to entrust A.'s, and yours, and poor\r\nmatron's I find very difficult. And I thought He did not take care of\r\nB.'s hairs. What a reprobate I am!\" And a worse \"reprobate\" than this\r\nletter says; for in fact she did find it very difficult to entrust even\r\nher own \"hair to Him\"--as she confessed in another letter to the same\r\nfriend: \"God is displeased when we enquire too anxiously. A soul which\r\nhas really given itself to God does His will in the present, and trusts\r\nto the Father for the future. Now it is twenty years to-day [Aug. 11,\r\n1873] since I entered 'public life'--and I have not learnt that lesson\r\nyet--though the greater part of those twenty years have been as\r\ncompletely out of my hands to mould, and in His alone, as if they had\r\nbeen the movements of the planets.\" The surrender of her will to the\r\nkeeping of the Supreme Will was the spiritual perfection at which she\r\nmost continuously aimed. In consciousness of failure, she reproached\r\nherself for censoriousness, rebellion, impatience. She knew that some of\r\nall this, and much of her dejection, were morbid, and warned others\r\nagainst the like weakness. \"Do not depend, darling,\" she wrote to a\r\nfriend, \"upon 'light' in one sort of mystical way. There are things, as\r\nI know by experience, in which He sends us light by the hard good sense\r\nof others, not by our going over in sickness and solitude one thought,\r\nor rather feeling, over and over again by ourselves, which rather\r\nbrings darkness. I have felt this so much in my lonely life.\" But there\r\nwas another mystical way in which she found strength. In her spiritual\r\nlife, which was at once the complement and the sustaining source of her\r\noutward life, she followed, as she was fond of writing, \"the Way of the\r\nCross.\" There were moments indeed, but they were rare, in which she was\r\ninclined to draw back, and when her faith grew faint. \"O my Creator, art\r\nThou leading every man of us to perfection? Or is this only a\r\nmetaphysical idea for which there is no evidence? Is man only a constant\r\nrepetition of himself? Thou knowest that through all these 20 horrible\r\nyears [1873] I have been supported by the belief (I think I must believe\r\nit still or I am sure I could not work) that I was working with Thee who\r\nwert bringing every one, even our poor nurses, to perfection.\" Yet from\r\nevery doubt her assurance grew the stronger; and as she followed the Way\r\nof the Cross, she rose triumphant over suffering, finding in each loss\r\nof human sympathy a lesson that she should throw herself more entirely\r\ninto the Eternal Arms, and in every outbreak of human despondency or\r\nrebellion a call to closer union with the Eternal Goodness. \"O Father, I\r\nsubmit, I resign myself,\" she wrote in one of hundreds of similar\r\nmeditations, \"I accept with all my heart this stretching out of Thy hand\r\nto save me: Deal with me as Thou seest meet: Thy work begin, Thy work\r\ncomplete. O how vain it is, the vanity of vanities, to live in men's\r\nthoughts, instead of God's.\" And again: \"Wretch that I was not to see\r\nthat God was taking from me all human help in order to compel me to lean\r\non Him alone.\" She had little interest in rites and ceremonies as such,\r\nand she interpreted the doctrines of Christianity in her own way; but\r\nshe found great comfort in the Communion Service, as an expression of\r\nthe individual believer's participation in the sufferings and the\r\ntriumph of the greatest of the Mystics. For some years she entered in\r\nher diary a text from the mystical writers for each day. She took to\r\nherself their devotion, their communion with God, their self-surrender;\r\nshe adjusted their doctrine to her own beliefs. \"I believe,\" she wrote,\r\n\"in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth. And in Jesus\r\nChrist, His best son, our Master, who was born to show us the way\r\nthrough suffering to be also His sons and His daughters, His handmen and\r\nHis handmaidens, who lived in the same spirit with the Father, that we\r\nmay also live in that Holy Spirit whose meat was to do His Father's will\r\nand to finish His work, who suffered and died saying, 'That the world\r\nmay love the Father.' And I believe in the Father Almighty's love and\r\nfriendship, in the service of man being the service of God, the growing\r\ninto a likeness with Him by love, the being one with Him in will at\r\nlast, which is Heaven. I believe in the plan of Almighty Perfection to\r\nmake us all perfect. And thus I believe in the Life Everlasting.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the creed by which Miss Nightingale guided her life; this, the\r\npath to perfection along which she ever moved. There was nothing\r\necstatic in her mysticism, though she notes occasionally that she heard\r\n\"The voice,\" and often that she was conscious of receiving \"strong\r\nimpressions.\" They were impressions which came in moments of imaginative\r\ninsight, but yet which followed rationally from self-examination and\r\nmeditation on her creed. Patience and resignation were the states of the\r\npurified soul which she found hardest of attainment. She marked for her\r\nedification many a passage from devotional writers in which such virtues\r\nare enjoined; as in this from Thomas à Kempis: \"Oh Lord my God, patience\r\nis very necessary for me, for I perceive that many things in this life\r\ndo fall out as we would not.... It is so, my son. But my will is that\r\nthou seek not that peace which is void of temptations, or which\r\nsuffereth nothing contrary; but rather think that thou hast found peace,\r\nwhen thou art exercised with sundry tribulations and tried in many\r\nadversities.\" Her tribulations were often caused, she confessed, by her\r\nimpatience. \"O Lord, even now I am trying to snatch the management of\r\nThy world out of Thy hands.\" The middle path of perfection between the\r\nacquiescence of the quietist and the impatience of the worker was hard.\r\n\"Too little have I looked for something higher and better than my own\r\nwork--the work of Supreme Wisdom, which uses us whether we know it or\r\nnot. O God to Thy glory not to mine whatever happens, may be all my\r\nthought!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's meditations, written in the purgatorial stage, are\r\nmany and poignant. But there were times also when the mount of\r\nillumination was reached, when \"the palace of her soul\" was enlarged to\r\nreceive the indwelling Presence, and she found the perfect peace of\r\nthe mystic in the consciousness of union with the Supreme Wisdom; times\r\nwhen on the wings of the soul she attained with Dante to the empyrean:--\r\n\r\n                 Lume è lassù che visibile face\r\n                     Lo Creatore a quella creatura,\r\n                     Che solo in lui vedere ha la sua pace.\r\n\r\nPerfected in weakness, she was strong in moments of illumination \"to see\r\nGod in all things, and all things in God, the Eternal shining through\r\nthe accidents of space and time.\" [147]\r\n\r\n  [147] Letter to Mr. Jowett, April 17, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                         MISS NIGHTINGALE'S SCHOOL\r\n\r\n                                (1872-1879)\r\n\r\n     Let each Founder train as many in his or her spirit as he or she\r\n     can. Then the pupils will in their turn be Founders also.--\r\n     FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale did not do as she had planned, and go in her own person\r\nto St. Thomas's Hospital, but in another sense the year 1872 was the\r\nyear of her descent upon it. Not, indeed, as we saw in the preceding\r\nPart, that she had ever abandoned a personal interest in the Training\r\nSchool, but there were now new conditions which called for additional\r\ncare, and Miss Nightingale, being out of office, was more free to give\r\nit. Henceforth she became, in a yet more direct manner than heretofore,\r\nthe head of the Nightingale School, and the Chief of the Nightingale\r\nNurses.\r\n\r\nThe year 1871 had seen the removal of St. Thomas's Hospital from its\r\ntemporary quarters in the old Surrey Gardens to the present building\r\nopposite the Houses of Parliament. The foundation-stone had been laid by\r\nQueen Victoria in 1868. Miss Nightingale had been requested to ask the\r\nQueen to do this, and she had preferred the petition through Sir James\r\nClark. \"I never pressed Her Majesty so hard upon anything before,\" said\r\nhe, in announcing the Royal pleasure. The Queen had again shown her\r\ninterest in the Hospital by opening the new building in June 1871. The\r\nnumber of beds was now greatly increased, and with it the number of\r\nnurses and probationers. The control of the nurses was likely to be\r\nrelaxed as it was spread over a larger number, and Miss Nightingale\r\nresolved to hold a Visitation.\r\n\r\nFirst, she sent Dr. Sutherland with the consent of the hospital\r\nauthorities to inspect the new buildings and to consider all the\r\narrangements from the point of view of an expert sanitarian. She\r\nexamined and cross-examined Sisters and Nurses on the same points, and\r\nput into print a list of the defects which needed remedy.[148] Then Miss\r\nNightingale took in hand the education, technical and moral, of her own\r\nNightingale School. She had already observed that the Lady Probationers,\r\nappointed to responsible posts, were not always adequate to their\r\nduties: the overworked Matron had perhaps sometimes recommended\r\nunsuitable persons. She found on questioning the Nurses that their\r\ntechnical education did not reach the high standard which she desired to\r\nmaintain. She feared that the moral standard similarly fell short of her\r\nideal; nursing was coming to be regarded too much as a business\r\nprofession, and too little as a sacred calling. Miss Nightingale\r\ndetermined to throw herself into a sustained effort for the better\r\nrealization of her ideal. Directly or indirectly, she instituted\r\nsweeping reforms. The result of them was, as she wrote to Mr. Bonham\r\nCarter (Aug. 1875), that the Training School became \"a Home--a place of\r\nmoral, religious and practical training--a place of training of\r\ncharacter, habits, intelligence, as well as of acquiring knowledge.\"\r\nThose who saw the Nightingale nurses in these years were struck by the\r\nbright, kindly and pleasant spirit which seemed to pervade the company\r\nof them, and could well understand that the Institution was really, as\r\nits foundress intended, a home as well as a school.\r\n\r\n  [148] See Bibliography A, No. 67.\r\n\r\nMr. Whitfield, the Resident Medical Officer, who had acted since the\r\nfoundation of the Nursing School as Medical Instructor of the\r\nProbationers, resigned that post, and Mr. J. Croft, who had lately\r\nbecome one of the Surgeons to the Hospital, was appointed in his stead.\r\nMiss Nightingale saw and corresponded with Mr. Croft, and liked him\r\nmuch. \"I have always dreaded,\" he wrote (Feb. 24, 1873), \"remaining a\r\n'stagnant man.'[149] I hope to become, as you would have me, an active\r\nand faithful comrade.\" He gave clinical instruction to the Probationers;\r\ndelivered courses of lectures--general, medical, and surgical in the\r\nseveral terms--throughout the year, of which he submitted the syllabus\r\nto Miss Nightingale, and at her request drew up a \"Course of Reading for\r\nProbationers.\" Other members of the Medical Staff gave courses of\r\nlectures also, and examinations were made more regular and searching.\r\nThe answers written by the Probationers, and their notes on the\r\nlectures, were from time to time sent in to Miss Nightingale, so that\r\nshe might gain an idea of the general standard of instruction, and\r\nperhaps administer rebuke or encouragement to individual pupils. \"I\r\nthink,\" Miss Nightingale was told on one occasion, \"that the ladies are\r\nthoroughly ashamed of the appearance they made at Mr. Croft's last\r\nexamination, and wish to retrieve themselves.\" Their good resolutions\r\nseem to have been successful, for presently one of the Medical Officers\r\nreported that \"the answers which I have received this year collectively\r\nare much better than in former years, they are indeed exceedingly good.\"\r\n\"I read your Case-papers,\" Miss Nightingale wrote in one of her\r\nAddresses, \"with more interest than if they were novels. Some are\r\nmeagre, especially in the history of the cases. Some are good. Please\r\nremember that, besides your own instruction, you can give me some too,\r\nby making these most interesting cases as interesting as possible by\r\nmaking them accurate and entering into the full history.\" The new\r\nHospital had greatly increased the demands upon the time of the Matron,\r\nMrs. Wardroper, and left her less able to supervise the Probationers. An\r\nAssistant-Superintendent of the School was appointed with the title of\r\nHome Sister.[150] It was one of her duties to supplement the lectures\r\nand bedside demonstration of the medical officers by regular\r\nclass-teaching.\r\n\r\n  [149] The reference here was to Miss Nightingale's \"Address to the\r\n        Probationers\" (1872) in which she had written: \"To be a good nurse,\r\n        one must be an improving woman; for stagnant waters sooner or\r\n        later, and stagnant air, as we know ourselves, always grow corrupt\r\n        and unfit for use. Is any one of us a _stagnant woman_?\"\r\n\r\n  [150] The part of Home Sister was \"created,\" and was most efficiently\r\n        filled for 21 years, by Miss Crossland, who retired on a pension in\r\n        1895. \"Nearly 600 nurses completed their probationary course under\r\n        her care, and subsequently entered upon their vocation as nurses in\r\n        some general Hospital or Infirmary, or in training as District\r\n        Nurses for the Poor, and a very large number of them became\r\n        Matrons, Superintendents, or Ward Sisters.\" (_Nightingale Fund\r\n        Report_ for 1895).\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, however, attached even more importance to the Home\r\nSister's influence on the moral and spiritual side of the School. The\r\nHome Sister was to encourage general reading, to arrange Bible classes,\r\nto give interests to the nurses in order \"to keep them above the mere\r\nscramble for a remunerative place.\" The two sides of the School are\r\nclosely joined in the letters to Miss Nightingale from the Home Sister\r\nand Matron--letters telling on one page of the progress of Probationers\r\nin antiseptic dressing and so forth, and on another of their Bible\r\nreadings or selected hymns. Miss Nightingale was especially pleased when\r\nCanon Farrar allotted some seats at St. Margaret's to her nurses and\r\ntook a Confirmation class among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale relied, however, upon her own influence also. During\r\nher residence in London she now made a point of seeing regularly all the\r\nSisters, Nurses, and Probationers attached to her School. She had\r\nresolved, when Agnes Jones died, to \"give herself up to finding more\r\nAgnes Joneses.\" This was the task to which she now devoted a large part\r\nof her life. She was still untiring in the attempt to procure promising\r\nraw material. She applied to Mr. Spurgeon, among others, who in reply\r\n(July 29, 1877) hoped that from his church \"there would come quite a\r\nlittle army of recruits for your holy war. Rest assured that to me in\r\ncommon with all my country-men your name is very fragrant.\" When\r\napplications came to her for trained nurses from provincial towns, she\r\nused to tell them what Pastor Fliedner said when similar applications\r\ncame to him for trained Deaconesses from Kaiserswerth: \"Have _you_ sent\r\n_me_ any Probationers? I can't stamp material out of the ground.\" From\r\n1872 onwards all the \"raw material\" passed under Miss Nightingale's own\r\neye.\r\n\r\nShe was a shrewd judge of character. A collection of extracts from\r\nMr. Jowett's notes to her about his pupils, and of her pencilled notes\r\nupon her pupils, would furnish a gallery of types of young English men\r\nand English women. He used to write to her very freely about his\r\nundergraduates; and she liked it--teasing him sometimes about his dukes\r\nand marquises and inventing humorous nicknames for them. \"Why do I write\r\nto you,\" he said, \"about all these young men? Because it pleases me, and\r\nbecause I know that you are a student of human nature.\" She was indeed.\r\nShe read her visitors through and through. As soon as a Sister or a\r\nNurse took leave, Miss Nightingale wrote down a memorandum of the\r\nattainments, knowledge, and character of each. The character-sketches\r\nare terse and vivid, expressed sometimes in racy English. \"Miss A.[151]\r\nTittupy, flippant, pretension-y, veil down, ambitious, clever, not much\r\nfeeling, talk-y, underbred, no religion, may be persevering from\r\nambition to excel, but takes the thing up as an adventure like\r\nNap. III.\" \"Nurse B. A good little thing, spirited, too much friends\r\nwith G., shares in her flirtations.\" \"Miss C. Seems a woman of good\r\nfeeling and bad sense; much under the meridian of anybody who will try\r\nto persuade her. I think her praises have been sung exaggerated-ly. She\r\nwants a very steady hand over her. Such long-winded stories 5 points or\r\nat least half the compass off the subject in hand. Had I not been intent\r\non persuading her I should have been out of all patience.\" \"Miss D. As\r\nself-comfortable a jackass (or Joan-ass) as ever I saw.\" \"Nurse E. A\r\nmost capable little woman, no education, but one can't find it in one's\r\nheart to regret it, she seems as good as can be.\" \"Miss X. More\r\ncleverness than judgment, more activity than order, more hard sense than\r\nfeeling, never any high view of her calling, always thinking more of\r\nappearances than of the truth, more flippant than witty, more petulance\r\nthan vigour.\" \"Nurse Y. As poor a two-fisted thing as ever I saw, a\r\nmawkin to frighten away good nurses.\" There were many Sisters and Nurses\r\nso excellent in every respect that they needed nothing but\r\nencouragement; she was more careful to mark defects, and sometimes she\r\nwould write a note of warning or remonstrance immediately after an\r\ninterview, as to Miss Z.: \"A wise man says that true knowledge of\r\nanything whether in heaven or earth can only be gained by a true love of\r\nthe Ideal in it--that is, _of the best that we can do_ in it. Forgive\r\nme, dear Miss Z., do you think that you have the true _love_ of the\r\n_best_ in nursing? This is a question I ask myself daily in all I do. Do\r\nnot think me governess-ing. It is a question which each one of us can\r\nonly ask of, and answer to, herself.\" The notes which Miss Nightingale\r\ntook of conversations with Probationers did not refer only to those\r\nladies themselves. She questioned them closely of the state of the\r\nwards, the kind and extent of instruction they received, and the\r\ninfluence exerted by the several Sisters. She came to the conclusion\r\nthat the Probationers were not always adequately taught by the Sisters,\r\nand she drew up accordingly a \"Memorandum of Instruction to Ward Sisters\r\non their duties to Probationers.\" In one of her cross-examinations of\r\nherself, she wrote, \"God meant me for a reformer and I have turned out a\r\ndetective.\" But the reformer must needs on occasion play the\r\ndetective--especially if she cannot herself be on the scene. The close\r\nhand which Miss Nightingale kept upon her School during these years from\r\nher room in South Street or at Lea Hurst is extraordinary, but it was\r\ndone at a prodigious expenditure of labour. She notes the point herself:\r\nit was one of the sore trials of her lot that she had to \"write 100\r\nletters to do one little thing instead of being able to do it directly.\"\r\n\"It takes a great deal out of me,\" she wrote to a friend. \"I have never\r\nbeen used to influence people except by leading in _work_; and to have\r\nto influence them by talking and writing is hard. A more dreadful thing\r\nthan being cut short by death is being cut short by life in a paralysed\r\nstate.\"\r\n\r\n  [151] The initials are not the real ones.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's sense of the seriousness of the nurse's vocation by\r\nno means stifled her appreciation of fun. Each nurse had to write once a\r\nmonth a report, for submission to the Chief, of a day's work in the\r\nwards. \"I well remember,\" says one of her pupils, \"coming off duty one\r\nevening at 8 P.M. fagged, footsore, and weary. On entering the Home, the\r\nSister informed me that my report must be written immediately (we never\r\nknew beforehand on which day this sword of Damocles would fall upon us).\r\nSo after a hurried supper, I commenced jotting down the day's work. One\r\nof the rules was that everything we had done in the wards must be\r\nentered. A combination of truthfulness and temper resulted in the\r\nfollowing paragraph:--'8.15 A.M. Tooth-combed seven heads, had grand\r\nsport; mixed bag, measured one teaspoonful; cleanliness is next to\r\ngodliness!' Miss Nightingale, when she came to know me, had a hearty\r\nlaugh at this cheeky probationer's description of sport in Hospital\r\ncoverts.\" The cheekiness by no means prejudiced Miss Nightingale against\r\nthe pupil, who, a few years afterwards, was selected for a very\r\nresponsible post.[152] To be invited to tea and talk with the Chief was\r\nregarded as a great honour by her pupils, but, as young people will,\r\nthey sometimes made fun of it among themselves. \"Carefully dressed in my\r\nbest garments I was just starting on my first visit to South Street when\r\none of the nurses rushed up to me exclaiming, 'Miss Nightingale always\r\ngives a cake to the probationer who has tea with her, and the size of\r\nthe cake varies according to the poverty or otherwise of the nurse's\r\ndress.' So I hurried upstairs, exchanged my best coat for one that had\r\ndone country service for many years and came home from my tea-party the\r\nproud possessor of a cake so large that it went the round of all the\r\nthirty-six probationers.\" This story also was told presently to Miss\r\nNightingale, who enjoyed it hugely. She herself often wrote in a playful\r\nvein; as in this note to a pupil who was not taking due care of herself:\r\n\"Ah, what a villain you are! _I knowed yer!_ If any one else were to do\r\nas you do in nursing yourself, you would discharge her from the face of\r\nthe earth. And see the results! Then, I'll be bound you've eaten none of\r\nthose victuals yourself.\"\r\n\r\n  [152] See below, p. 348.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThe _dossiers_ which Miss Nightingale preserved and, annotated (often\r\npicking out special points by black, blue, and red pencil respectively)\r\nwere of use to her in the important work of selecting particular ladies\r\nfor particular posts. The most notable appointment during these years\r\nwas that of a Lady Superintendent to organize District Nursing in\r\nLondon. We have heard already that Miss Nightingale regarded this\r\ndevelopment as the proper sequel to the reform of workhouse nursing.\r\nThat was in 1866, and now she reproached herself: \"I had then resolved\r\nto give myself to promoting District Nursing, and now that District\r\nNursing comes it is too late for me to help.\" This lament, however, was\r\nunnecessary. It was Miss Nightingale's published _Suggestions_[153] upon\r\nwhich the promoters of the movement acted. Foremost among them was Mr.\r\nRathbone, who was moved to extend to London the experiment which he had\r\ncarried out successfully in Liverpool.[154] He at once came to consult\r\nMiss Nightingale. It was her letter to the _Times_, too, reprinted as a\r\npamphlet,[155] that made the \"Metropolitan Nursing Association\" well\r\nknown to the public. In this letter, as in all her writings on the same\r\nsubject, Miss Nightingale insisted that nothing second best would be\r\ngood enough for nursing among the sick poor, that such nurses must be\r\nhealth missionaries, and that to obtain suitable women for the service\r\nthere must be \"a real home, within reach of their work, for the nurses\r\nto live in.\" The system thus inaugurated in London was, she said,\r\n\"twenty years ago a paradox, but twenty years hence will be a\r\ncommonplace.\" But the chief of the direct services which Miss\r\nNightingale rendered to the movement was in persuading one of the ablest\r\nof her pupils--Miss Florence Lees (Mrs. Dacre Craven)--to accept the\r\nposition of Superintendent-General. She filled the post with high\r\nefficiency for some years, and throughout her work was in constant\r\nconsultation with Miss Nightingale.\r\n\r\n  [153] Bibliography A, No. 75.\r\n\r\n  [154] See above, p. 125.\r\n\r\n  [155] Bibliography A, No. 80.\r\n\r\nIn April 1878 it looked as if Miss Nightingale would have to find\r\nSuperintendents and Nurses for another purpose. War with Russia was\r\nbelieved to be imminent; two Army Corps were being prepared for\r\nimmediate embarkation; and Sir William Muir, Director-General of the\r\nArmy Medical Department, came to a consultation in South Street upon the\r\nfemale nursing establishment to be dispatched to the (unknown) seat of\r\nwar. Miss Nightingale spent some anxious days and sleepless nights in\r\nconsidering which of her pupils were best fitted and could best be\r\nspared for this special service, but the war-cloud passed away.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Miss Lees to organize District Nursing in London was\r\nonly one, though it was the most important, of many responsible\r\nappointments, over which Miss Nightingale took infinite pains in order\r\nto place the right person in the right place. Hospitals and workhouse\r\nInfirmaries in London and in various parts of the country looked to the\r\nNightingale School for superintendents; or sometimes if an important\r\npost were thrown open by advertisement, Miss Nightingale used her\r\ninfluence to secure the election of a Nightingale candidate. Here,\r\nagain, her labour was the greater because she was not herself on the\r\nspot and had others to consult. There was a Triumvirate, she used to\r\nsay; the Triumvirs being Mr. Henry Bonham Carter (the Secretary of the\r\nNightingale Fund), Mrs. Wardroper (the Matron) and Miss Nightingale\r\n(here, as in the Crimea, the Lady-in-Chief)--with Dr. Sutherland,\r\nsometimes, in the background as a court of ultimate appeal. Whenever an\r\nimportant post fell vacant, the amount of cross-correspondence was\r\nprodigious. As soon as a lady was selected by the triumvirate for\r\npromotion, Miss Nightingale would call the chosen pupil more closely to\r\nher, make her intimate acquaintance and prepare her for the work. Then\r\nthere was the difficult duty of effecting exchanges. The Sisters when\r\nthey had once left St. Thomas's were, after all, free agents; and though\r\nthe deference which they all paid to Miss Nightingale's wishes was\r\ngreat, yet the ladies had ambitions, preferences, views of their own,\r\nand her influence had often to be exercised by humouring, petting,\r\ncoaxing:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Miss Rachel Williams._) 35 SOUTH STREET, _Jan._ 17 [1874]....\r\n     We thought that this arrangement was what would approve itself best\r\n     to your best judgment. But as I am well aware that my dear\r\n     Goddess-baby has--well, a baby-side, I shall not be surprised at\r\n     any outburst--though I know full well that in the dear Pearl's\r\n     terrible distress, you will do everything and more than everything\r\n     possible to drag her through and to spare her and to keep _her_ up\r\n     and the _place_ going. Only don't break yourself down, my dear\r\n     child.... Alas, I would so fain relieve you of your \"bitterness.\"\r\n     You say you are \"bitter\"; and indeed you _are_.... I would not have\r\n     written thus much, unless urged by seeing my Goddess-baby suffering\r\n     from delusions. And how can a woman be a Superintendent unless she\r\n     has learnt to superintend herself?\r\n\r\n     (_To the same._) _May 2 [1874]._ I have this moment received your\r\n     charming letter, which is just like yourself. And I _must_ write\r\n     and thank you for it at once. It has taken a load off my heart. It\r\n     is a pure joy to me: because I see _yourself_ (and not another) in\r\n     it. And life has not many joys for me, my darling.\r\n\r\n     (_To the same._) _Dec._ 5 [1874]. After much consideration my\r\n     suggestion was that you should remain another six months in the\r\n     same position, not because I had any idea of your remaining\r\n     indefinitely on and on as you are, but because Edinburgh serves as\r\n     a capital and indispensable preparation. But this is only an old\r\n     woman's advice: which probably the Goddess will not much regard and\r\n     which is subject any way, of course, to hearing your own wishes,\r\n     ideas and reasons for one course or another.... If there is such\r\n     violent haste, telegraph to me any day and come up by the next\r\n     express or on the wires. And I will turn out India, my Mother, and\r\n     all the Queen's horses and all the Queen's men together, with\r\n     one-sixth of the human race, and lay my energies (not many left) at\r\n     the Goddess' feet.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale had a large heart and an unprejudiced mind; she was\r\nopen to discern character and efficiency in many different forms; but\r\nnaturally there were those, among her pupils, by whom she was more\r\nparticularly attracted. The letters just quoted introduce us to two of\r\nthese. Of one of them Miss Nightingale noted in her diary, after the\r\nfirst interview: \"Miss P. came. I have found a pearl of great price.\"\r\nThe name was adopted, and she became in familiar correspondence \"The\r\nPearl.\" She filled important posts, and became one of Miss Nightingale's\r\ndearest friends. Of the other Probationer, she wrote: \"Besides the\r\npleasure of becoming acquainted with Miss Williams it was quite a\r\npleasure to my bodily eyes to look at her. She is like a queen; and all\r\nher postures are so beautiful, without being in the least theatrical.\"\r\nThis lady was \"the Goddess\" of the letters already quoted. She was for\r\nmany years Matron of St. Mary's Hospital in London, with a Training\r\nSchool under her, and she was afterwards appointed Lady Superintendent\r\nof Nurses during the Egyptian campaign of 1884-85. Even her marriage\r\nshortly afterwards did not break her friendship with Miss Nightingale.\r\nSometimes a pupil on leaving St. Thomas's would take a situation against\r\nMiss Nightingale's advice or without consulting her. \"I should feel\r\nhappier,\" wrote one pupil, \"if you saw the matter in the same light as\r\nI do.\" I expect that in such a case the self-willed pupil had to do very\r\nwell in her post in order to win Miss Nightingale's approval. There were\r\nfew important posts in the nursing world which were not filled during\r\nthese and the following years by pupils of the Nightingale School. An\r\nappointment which gave special satisfaction to Miss Nightingale and her\r\nCouncil was that of Miss Machin to be Matron of St. Bartholomew's\r\n(1878).[156] At one and the same time (1882), former Nightingale\r\nProbationers held the post of Matron or of Superintendent of Nurses in\r\nthe following among other institutions:--Cumberland Infirmary\r\n(Carlisle), Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Huntingdon County Hospital, Leeds\r\nInfirmary, Lincoln County Hospital; at Liverpool, in the Royal\r\nInfirmary, the Southern Hospital, and the Workhouse Infirmary; Netley,\r\nRoyal Victoria Hospital; Putney, Royal Hospital for Incurables;\r\nSalisbury Infirmary; Sydney (N.S.W.) General Hospital; and in London, at\r\nMarylebone Workhouse Infirmary, the Metropolitan and National Nursing\r\nAssociation, the North London District Nursing Association, the\r\nPaddington Association, St. Mary's Hospital, and the Westminster\r\nHospital. To many of these Institutions a large number of nurses,\r\nforming in some cases a complete Nursing staff, had been provided from\r\nthe Nightingale School, and the result was the gradual introduction into\r\nBritish Hospitals of an organized system of trained nursing.[157] The\r\nmovement was not confined to Great Britain. \"Nightingale Nurses\" became\r\nMatrons or Superintendents in many Colonies (_e.g._ Canada and Ceylon),\r\nin India, in Sweden, in Germany, and in the United States. Moreover,\r\nother Hospitals and Institutions had followed the lead of Miss\r\nNightingale and established Training Schools, and several of these were\r\nagain superintended by her pupils; as, for instance, at Edinburgh (under\r\nMiss Pringle), at the Marylebone Infirmary (Miss Vincent), at St. Mary's\r\n(Miss Williams), and at the Westminster (Miss Pyne). These Schools in\r\ntheir turn sent out Lady Superintendents, Matrons, and nurses to other\r\ninstitutions, and thus the movement of the waters, which Miss\r\nNightingale was able to start after her return from the Crimea, extended\r\nin an ever-widening circle. \"Let us hail,\" she said in an Address to her\r\nown Probationers (1884), \"the successes of other Training Schools,\r\nsprung up, thank God, so fast and well in latter years. But the best way\r\nwe can hail them is not to be left behind ourselves. Let us, in the\r\nspirit of friendly rivalry, rejoice in their progress, as they do, I am\r\nsure, in ours. _All_ can win the prize. One training school is not\r\nlowered because others win. On the contrary, all are lowered if others\r\nfail.\"\r\n\r\n  [156] Miss Machin had in 1875 gone from St. Thomas's, with a staff of\r\n        nurses, to the General Hospital at Montreal.\r\n\r\n  [157] Full particulars may be found in the Annual _Reports of the\r\n        Nightingale Fund_ (now accessible in the Library of the British\r\n        Museum).\r\n\r\nThe appointment of a Nightingale Nurse to a post outside St. Thomas's\r\ndid not mean that she passed out of Miss Nightingale's ken. On the\r\ncontrary, it meant, as we have already heard (p. 191), that her cares\r\ntook further scope. \"I am immersed,\" she wrote to M. Mohl (June 21,\r\n1873), \"in such a torrent of my trained matrons and nurses, going and\r\ncoming, to and from Edinburgh and Dublin, to and from watering-places\r\nfor their health, dining, tea-ing, sleeping--sleeping by day as well as\r\nby night.\" \"Her attitude to her lieutenants,\" says one of them, \"was\r\nthat of a mother to daughters. Yet they were not living with her in an\r\nenclosure, but were out in the open encountering the experiences of\r\ntheir individual lives, often under very difficult conditions. When they\r\nconfided their trials to her, she advised them in the spirit of her own\r\nhigh aims, wrestling with them or encouraging them, as the case might\r\nbe, with fulness of attention, which might lead each one of us in turn\r\nto think that she had no other care.\" Miss Nightingale's own papers, and\r\nletters to nurses which I have seen, bear out all this in the fullest\r\ndegree and to an amazing point of detail. With an erring Sister she took\r\ninfinite pains. She was firm to save from any discredit the good name of\r\nthe Nightingale School and to maintain the efficiency of its work; but\r\nthis firmness went hand in hand with infinite pity for the individual,\r\nand any pain which her discipline may have caused to others was as\r\nnothing compared to the agony which her own tender and self-torturing\r\nsoul endured. All Nightingale Sisters were her \"daughters,\" alike in\r\nCanada or in Scotland, as at St. Thomas's. She advised them, helped\r\nthem, planned for them, with an extraordinary thoroughness. Was a Sister\r\nreturning to work in the North after a holiday in London? She would\r\nremember how careless girls sometimes are of regular meals, and her\r\nCommissionaire would be dispatched to see the Sister off and put a\r\nluncheon-basket in the carriage. Miss Nightingale was an old hand at\r\npurveying, and amongst her papers are careful lists of what such baskets\r\nwere to contain. She heard of a member of a certain nursing staff being\r\nrun down. \"What Miss X. wants is to be fed like a baby,\" she wrote,\r\nsending a detailed dietary and adding, \"Get the things out of my money.\"\r\nShe was constant in seeing that her \"daughters\" took proper holidays;\r\nsometimes helping to defray the expense, more often having them to stay\r\nwith her in South Street or in the country. She was constant, too, in\r\nsending them presents of books--both of a professional kind likely to be\r\nof help to them in their work, and such as would encourage a taste for\r\ngeneral literature. To those who were in London hospitals or\r\ninfirmaries, her notes were often accompanied by \"fresh country eggs,\"\r\ngame, or flowers. She always remembered them when Christmas came round\r\nand sent evergreens for the wards. At one or two of the London\r\nInfirmaries there is a Matron's Garden, planted with rhododendrons. The\r\nplants were sent by Miss Nightingale from Embley. To the nurses serving\r\nunder her friends she sent presents also. She had a verse of the\r\nHospital Hymn[158] finely illuminated on a large scale and gave it,\r\nsuitably framed, to various institutions. She was as curious and as\r\nhelpful in relation to the nursing arrangements in other hospitals as in\r\nSt. Thomas's itself. Her pupils, wherever they might be, referred to\r\ntheir \"dear Mistress\" or \"dearest friend\" in all their trials,\r\ndifficulties, perplexities, and she never failed them--sending words of\r\nencouragement, advice, and good cheer. \"Should there be anything in\r\nwhich I can be of the least use, here I am\": this was a frequent formula\r\nin her messages. In these letters a religious note is seldom absent.\r\nNever, I imagine, has there been a series of letters in which a high\r\nideal was more continually and persistently presented. But the letters\r\nare not less conspicuous for shrewd practical sense and worldly\r\nwisdom--as, for instance, when she advises a candidate for a certain\r\npost not to frighten the Hospital Board by starting a suggestion at once\r\n\"to reform the whole system.\" Miss Nightingale put a high value, too,\r\nupon _esprit de corps_ as an aid to maintaining a high standard of duty.\r\nEvery pupil of the Nightingale School was taught to think of it as an\r\nAlma Mater to which she owed much, even as she had received much; all\r\nthe Sisters who went out into the world from the School were encouraged\r\nto regard themselves as members still of a corporate body, however\r\nwidely separated from one another they might be. Miss Nightingale's\r\nletters often included news of one \"old boy,\" so to speak, passed on to\r\nanother; each was inspired to take courage from the success of others.\r\nThe volume of correspondence thus grew from year to year, as the circle\r\nwidened, and at the time with which we are now concerned it was\r\nenormous. The wonder is how Miss Nightingale was able to do anything\r\nelse besides. Mothers with large families sometimes find the burden of\r\ncorrespondence heavy as the sons and daughters leave home and have\r\nfamilies of their own. Headmasters, who make a point of keeping in touch\r\nwith old pupils, find it heavier still, when they are called upon to\r\nadvise or sympathise with each successive school-generation upon\r\nopenings, prospects, careers. The secretaries of the Appointments\r\nBoards, which now organize this kind of work in the case of\r\nUniversities, do not find their duties light. Combine these functions of\r\nmother, headmaster, and Appointments Board, and an idea will be obtained\r\nof Miss Nightingale's work as the Nursing Chief.\r\n\r\n  [158] To hands that work and eyes that see\r\n          Give wisdom's heavenly lore,\r\n        That whole and sick and weak and strong\r\n          May praise Thee ever more.\r\n\r\nA selection of extracts from particular letters to various\r\ncorrespondents will perhaps convey the impression better than any\r\nfurther attempt at general description. The extracts are only not\r\ntypical in that I omit details about nursing arrangements and hospital\r\ncases:--\r\n\r\n     (_To a Matron whose assistant was leaving to undertake a new\r\n     work._) 35 SOUTH STREET, _Sept._ 30 [1876]. 6 A.M. MY DEAREST \"LITTLE\r\n     SISTER\"--This comes that you may know (though you cannot know) how\r\n     much one is thinking of you--here below--in what must be a terrible\r\n     wrench in our lot: as to the little mother who is left behind _and_ to\r\n     the daughter who goes to try her fate even in the happiest change of a\r\n     new and untried future, it must be a terrible wrench. But if I am\r\n     thinking and feeling and praying for you so much, how must the\r\n     _One_ Above feel for you? A sober view both you and I take of the\r\n     possible futures of life: veiled in mist and sometimes, nay often,\r\n     in drizzle: with gleams of the Father's love, in bright sunshine:\r\n     and both of us knowing well that \"behind the clouds\" He is still\r\n     shining, brightly shining: the Sun of Righteousness. Though I ought\r\n     to take a far soberer view than you, my dear \"Little Sister,\" for I\r\n     have undergone twice your years. And for the same reason I ought\r\n     too, though I am afraid faith often fails me, to take a brighter\r\n     view too. But whether I do or not and whether I write or not, your\r\n     trials shall always be my trials, dear \"Little Sister,\" your people\r\n     shall be my people, as my God is your God. There can be no stronger\r\n     tie. I think this letter will reach you just as Miss Williams has\r\n     started. She will find a letter of welcome from me at St.\r\n     Mary's.[159] I daresay just now she feels dreary enough. But her\r\n     great spirit will soon buckle to her work: and find a joy in it. I\r\n     am glad she takes some of your own people. I do earnestly trust\r\n     that you will find help and comfort in Miss Pyne, to whom my best\r\n     love, and Miss Mitchelson. I am sure you do not feel so stranded as\r\n     I did when I was left at Scutari in the Crimea War alone, when\r\n     Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge went home: on many, many times since--when\r\n     Sidney Herbert, the War Minister with whom I had worked five years\r\n     in the War Office died: when Sir John Lawrence, the Indian Viceroy,\r\n     left India: and many other times when the future fell across my\r\n     life like a great black wall, not (as in other lives) making a\r\n     change, but completely cutting off the future from the past: and\r\n     again when my Father's death brought upon me a load of cares which\r\n     would have been too great had I had nothing else to do and had I\r\n     been in health. I tell you these things, my dear \"Little Sister,\"\r\n     or rather my dearest child, because--because--I was going to say\r\n     something, but I can only pray.... Give all our members of our\r\n     common calling with you who remember me my heart-felt sympathy that\r\n     they are losing Miss Williams: and give them joy that they have you.\r\n     God bless us all: a solemn blessing.--F. N.\r\n\r\n  [159] To another Superintendent who was taking up a new post, Miss\r\n        Nightingale sent to her room \"a wreath of everlastings and corn to\r\n        be my little messengers to say how you are sowing seed that will\r\n        grow up and be the Bread of Life for us, and how the work that you\r\n        are doing is everlasting. Thank God for it.\"\r\n\r\n     (_To a Nurse confronted with a difficult situation._) LEA HURST,\r\n     _August_ 30 [1873].... It is quite useless for either you or me to\r\n     take upon ourselves the solution of this enormous difficulty: we\r\n     must leave it to God. But at present the duty is plain. And God\r\n     always helps those who are obeying His call to duty: often gives\r\n     them the privilege of saving others. Do you remember the great\r\n     London theatre which was burnt down at a Christmas pantomime? Who\r\n     were the heroes then? The poor clown and the poor pantaloon who\r\n     were at their duty! The audience who were there because they liked\r\n     it made a selfish stampede, and but for a lucky accident might all\r\n     have been crushed or burnt. But the clown and the pantaloon, though\r\n     there was not a moment to save a shawl or a coat to throw over the\r\n     ballet-dancers--gauze-dressed women who, if a spark had fallen upon\r\n     them would have been instantly in a blaze--actually carried out\r\n     every one of these women safely into the snow, gauze and all. And\r\n     the carpenter collected the poor little ballet-children and dragged\r\n     them through the snow and slush to his own house, where he kept\r\n     them in safety. Brave clown--brave pantaloon--brave carpenter\r\n     (while the selfish audience who were there for amusement almost\r\n     jostled each other to death). So does God always stand by those who\r\n     are there for duty--though they be only a clown or pantaloon. All\r\n     our cares arise from one of two things: either we have not taken up\r\n     our work for His love, in which case we know He has bound Himself\r\n     to take our cares upon Him: or we do not sufficiently see His love\r\n     in calling us to His work.\r\n\r\n     (_To a Lady Superintendent._) 35 SOUTH STREET, _Dec._ 30 [1874]. I\r\n     wish you and all our Nurses \"God Speed\" with all my soul and\r\n     strength at the beginning of this New Year which I hardly expected\r\n     to see. May it bring every blessing to them; though sometimes, do\r\n     you know, I am so cowardly that I scarcely dare to say \"God bless\r\n     you\" to those I love well: because we know what His blessings are.\r\n     \"Blessed are they that mourn: Blessed are they that are persecuted\r\n     for righteousness' sake: Blessed are the pure in heart.\" And as we\r\n     get on in life, we know both how truly those blessings _are_\r\n     blessings, and how much there is to go through to win them. You are\r\n     young, my dear: a thousand years younger than this old black\r\n     beetle. And I have often a shuddering sort of maternal feeling in\r\n     wishing you \"blessings.\" ...\r\n\r\n     (_To a Matron who was having a dispute with her Committee._) ... My\r\n     thoughts are your thoughts; they are full of your--may I not say\r\n     our?--sad affair. And I was just sending you a note to ask what was\r\n     doing when your sad little note came. Is not the thing of first\r\n     importance to lay a statement of the whole case before your\r\n     President? Nay, would it not be breaking faith with him if it were\r\n     not done? This _is_ now being done. Is not the next thing for you\r\n     to take no step till you know the results of this letter to\r\n     him--the next action he will take? You will remember that I stated\r\n     to him at your friend's suggestion and at yours, that you wished\r\n     for, that you _invited, a full investigation to be made by him and\r\n     that you wished to abide by his decision_. I thought this so\r\n     important, in order that I might not appear to be asking for any\r\n     personal favour but only for justice, that I underlined it. Will it\r\n     not seem as if you were afraid to await his full understanding of\r\n     the case (how far from the truth!) if you precipitately resigned\r\n     before he had had time even to consider the statement? The Matron\r\n     must show no fear, else it would indeed be sacrificing the fruit of\r\n     eight years' most excellent work. Surely she should wait\r\n     quietly--that is the true dignity--with her friends around her till\r\n     the President's answer is given. The \"persecuted for righteousness'\r\n     sake\" never run away.\r\n\r\n     (_To a Matron after a visit to South Street._) DEAREST LITTLE SISTER\r\n     AND EXTRAORDINARY LITTLE VILLAINESS--You absconded last night just as\r\n     your dinner was going up, and it would not have taken you longer to\r\n     eat your dinner here than your supper at hospital. I was a great goose\r\n     not to make certain of this when you arrived. But I thought it was\r\n     agreed. To punish you I send your dinner after you.\r\n\r\n     (_To the same._) 10 SOUTH STREET, _April_ 21 [1879]. DEAREST, VERY\r\n     DEAREST--Very precious to me is your note. I almost hope you will not\r\n     come _to-morrow_: the weather is so cold here. St. Mary's expects you:\r\n     and next do I. Be sure that the word \"trouble\" is not known where\r\n     you are concerned. Make up your dear mind to a long holiday: that's\r\n     what you have to do now. God bless you. We shall have time to talk.\r\n\r\nThus day after day and year after year did such correspondence\r\ncontinue--now grave, now gay; filled alike with affection and with\r\ncounsel. I have counted as many as a hundred letters received in a year\r\nfrom a single Superintendent. There were several years in which the\r\ntotal of Miss Nightingale's nursing correspondence has to be counted in\r\nthousands. As the years passed the demand on her affections, her\r\nbrain-power, and her bodily strength became well-nigh overwhelming.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale did not rely only upon individual intercourse for the\r\nexercise of influence. She believed in the pulpit, as well as in the\r\ncloset, and from time to time addressed the Probationer-Nurses\r\ncollectively.[160] Of the first of the series, written in 1872, Dr.\r\nSutherland, to whom Miss Nightingale submitted her manuscript, said: \"It\r\nis just what it ought to be, written as the thoughts come up. This is\r\nthe only writing which goes like an arrow to its mark. It is full of\r\ngentle wisdom and does for Hospital nursing what your _Notes_ did for\r\nnursing.\" It is the best of her Addresses, and the medical officers at\r\nSt. Thomas's insisted on every Probationer mastering it. There is\r\nnaturally a good deal of repetition in the Discourses as a whole. The\r\ngist of them is: that nursing requires a special call; that it needs,\r\nmore than most occupations, a religious basis; that it is an art, in\r\nwhich constant progress is the law of life; and lastly, that the nurse,\r\nwhether she wills it or not, has of necessity a moral influence. These\r\nideas appear in almost every Address, and are illustrated in various\r\nways. \"A woman who takes the sentimental view of Nursing (which she\r\ncalls 'ministering,' as if she were an angel) is of course worse than\r\nuseless; a woman possessed with the idea that she is making a sacrifice\r\nwill never do; and a woman who thinks any kind of Nursing work 'beneath\r\na Nurse' will simply be in the way.\" The true Nurse must have a\r\nvocation; and, next, she must follow the call in a religious spirit. \"If\r\nwe have not true religious feeling and purpose, Hospital life, the\r\nhighest of all things _with_ these, becomes _without_ them a mere\r\nroutine and bustle, and a very hardening routine and bustle.\" To follow\r\nnursing as a religious vocation is, however, not enough; for it is a\r\ndifficult art, requiring constant study and effort. This is the note\r\nwhich Miss Nightingale struck in the opening words of her first Address\r\nand it is the one which most frequently recurs. The besetting sin of the\r\nNightingale Nurses in the early days was, it seems, self-sufficiency.\r\nThey knew that their Training School was the first of its kind; and\r\nthey were apt to give themselves airs. Mr. Henley's character-sketches\r\nin verse of the \"Lady Probationer\" and \"Staff-Nurse, New Style,\" hint\r\npleasantly at this, and in plain prose men used to write of \"the\r\nconceited Nightingales.\" The day is gone by, it was said in a medical\r\njournal, when a novel would picture a Nurse as a Mrs. Gamp; she would\r\nfigure, rather, as active, useful, and clever, but also as \"a pert and\r\nvery conceited young woman.\" Self-sufficiency, then, is the failing\r\nwhich the Chief of the Nurses constantly chastises. She does so by\r\nholding up before her pupils the ideal of nursing as a progressive art.\r\n\"For us who nurse,\" she says, \"our nursing is a thing in which, unless\r\nin it we are making _progress_ every year, every month, every\r\nweek,--take my word for it, we are going _back_. The more experience we\r\ngain, the more progress we can make. The progress you make in your\r\nyear's training with us is as nothing to what you must make every year\r\n_after_ your year's training is over. A woman who thinks in herself:\r\n'Now I am a full Nurse, a skilled Nurse, I have learnt all that there is\r\nto be learnt'--take my word for it, she does not know what a Nurse is,\r\nand she never will know; she is gone back already.\" This rule applies to\r\nthe technical side of the work, and perhaps yet more to the moral side.\r\nNurses cannot avoid exercising a moral influence. They exercise it by\r\ntheir characters, and no point can ever be reached at which a woman can\r\nsay, \"Now my character is perfect.\" \"Nurses are not chaplains\"; \"it is\r\nwhat a nurse is in herself, and what comes out of herself, out of what\r\nshe _is_ (almost without knowing it herself) that exercises a moral or\r\nreligious influence over her patients. No set form of words is of any\r\nuse. And patients are so quick to see whether a Nurse is consistent\r\nalways in herself--whether she _is_ what she _says_ to them. And if she\r\nis not, it is no use. If she is, of how much use may the simplest word\r\nof soothing, of comfort, or even of reproof--especially in the quiet\r\nnight--be to the roughest patient! But if she wishes to do this, she\r\nmust keep up a sort of divine calm and high sense of duty in her own\r\nmind.\" And every good nurse ought to wish to do this, because her\r\nopportunities are unique. \"Hospital nurses have charge of their patients\r\nin a way that no other woman has charge. No other woman is in charge\r\nreally of grown-up men. Also the hospital nurse is in charge of people\r\nwhen they are singularly alive to impressions. She leaves her stamp upon\r\nthem whether she will or no.\"\r\n\r\n  [160] For the dates of these Addresses, see Bibliography A, No. 63.\r\n\r\nSuch are the leading ideas which Miss Nightingale develops in her series\r\nof Hospital Sermons. I have heard it said that she addressed the Nurses\r\nin the style and spirit of the Sunday School. There are passages to\r\nwhich such a description may be applied; but, taken as a whole, the\r\ndiscourses suggest a different comparison: they recall the style and\r\nspirit of the best Public School or College Sermons. Sometimes the\r\nlikeness is close and explicit. On one occasion Miss Nightingale thought\r\nthat the prevailing evil in her School was a spirit of irresponsible and\r\nill-informed criticism. She rebuked it by telling a true story, which\r\nperhaps she may have had from Mr. Jowett:--\r\n\r\n     In a large college, questions, about things which the students\r\n     could but imperfectly understand in the conduct of the college, had\r\n     become too warm. The superintendent went into the hall one morning,\r\n     and after complimenting the young men on their studies, he said:\r\n     \"This morning I heard two of the porters, while at their work, take\r\n     up a Greek book lying on my table; one tried to read it, and the\r\n     other declared it ought to be held upside down to be read. Neither\r\n     could agree which _was_ upside down, but both thought themselves\r\n     quite capable of arguing about Greek, though neither could read it.\r\n     They were just coming to fisticuffs when I sent the two on\r\n     different errands.\" Not a word was added: the students laughed and\r\n     retired, but they understood the moral well enough, and from that\r\n     day there were few questions or disputes about the plans and\r\n     superiors of the college, or about their own obedience to rules and\r\n     discipline.\r\n\r\nThen, again, what boy has not heard in Chapel or in school-song a moral\r\ndrawn from how things will look \"forty years on\"? Here is Miss\r\nNightingale's passage on the theme:--\r\n\r\n     Most of you here present will be in a few years in charge of\r\n     others, filling posts of responsibility. _All_ are on the threshold\r\n     of active life. Then our characters will be put to the test,\r\n     whether in some position of charge or of subordination, or of both.\r\n     Shall we be found wanting? unable to control ourselves, therefore\r\n     unable to control others? with many good qualities, perhaps, but\r\n     owing to selfishness, conceit, to some want of purpose, some\r\n     laxness, carelessness, lightness, vanity, some temper, habits of\r\n     self-indulgence, or want of disinterestedness, unequal to the\r\n     struggle of life, the business of life, and ill-adapted to the\r\n     employment of Nursing which we have chosen for ourselves and which,\r\n     almost above all others, requires earnest purpose and the reverse\r\n     of all these faults. Thirty years hence, if we could suppose us all\r\n     standing here again passing judgment on ourselves, and telling\r\n     sincerely why one has succeeded and another has failed--why the\r\n     life of one has been a blessing to those she has had charge of, and\r\n     another has gone from one thing to another, pleasing herself and\r\n     bringing nothing to good--what would we give to be able _now_ to\r\n     see all this before us?\r\n\r\nThen she exhorted her pupils not to be too nice in the picking and\r\nchoosing of places. \"Our brains are pretty nearly useless, if we only\r\nthink of what we want and should like ourselves; and not of what posts\r\nare wanting us, what our posts are wanting _in_ us. What would you think\r\nof a soldier who--if he were to be put on duty in the honourable post of\r\ndifficulty, as sentry may be, in the face of the enemy (and we nurses\r\nare always in the face of the enemy, always in the face of life or death\r\nfor our patients)--were to answer his commanding officer, 'No, he had\r\nrather mount guard at barracks or study musketry'; or, if he had to go\r\nas pioneer, or on a forlorn hope, were to say, 'No, that don't suit my\r\nturn?'\" So, again, there are excellent little discourses on the Uses and\r\nLimits of School Friendships, on the Right Use of Dress, and on the Art\r\nof Exercising Authority, with wise sayings taken direct in some cases\r\nfrom Plato. \"Those who rule must not be those who are desirous to rule.\"\r\n\"The world, whether of a ward or of an Empire, is governed, not by many\r\nwords, but by few; though some, especially women, seem to expect to\r\ngovern by talk and nothing else.\" \"She who is the most royal mistress of\r\nherself is the only woman fit to be in charge; for she who has no\r\ncontrol over herself, who cannot master her own temper, how can she be\r\nplaced over others, to control them through the better principle, if she\r\nhas none or little of her own?\" Her remarks on Dress are interesting,\r\nand might be applied, _mutatis mutandis_, to young men who sometimes\r\ncombine a habit of slovenliness with a garish taste in waistcoats. Some\r\nof the Nightingale nurses seem to have grumbled at the uniform, and to\r\nhave taken their revenge upon it by gorgeous apparel when off duty. Miss\r\nNightingale avers that to her eye no women's dress was so becoming as\r\nthat of her Nurses, and for the rest she draws a moral from God's\r\n\"clothing\" of the field flowers:--\r\n\r\n     First: their \"clothes\" are exactly suitable for the kind of place\r\n     they are in and the kind of work they have to do. So should ours\r\n     be. Second: field flowers are never double: double flowers change\r\n     their useful stamens for showy petals and so have no seeds. These\r\n     double flowers are like the useless appendages now worn on the\r\n     dress, and very much in your way. Wild flowers have purpose in all\r\n     their beauty. So ought dress to have;--nothing purposeless about\r\n     it. Third: the colours of the wild flower are perfect in harmony,\r\n     and not many of them. Fourth: there is not a speck on the freshness\r\n     with which flowers come out of the dirty earth. Even when our\r\n     clothes are getting rather old we may imitate the flower: for we\r\n     may make them look as fresh as a daisy.... Oh, my dear Nurses,\r\n     whether gentlewomen or not, don't let people say of you that you\r\n     are like \"Girls of the Period\": let them say that you are like\r\n     \"field flowers,\" and welcome.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale often sought, as every good School Preacher seeks, to\r\narrest the attention of the young by topical allusions, especially to\r\nstirring and heroic deeds. She often compared Hospital Nurses to\r\nmissionaries, and held up Livingstone as an example. He was one of the\r\nbest of missionaries, not as going about \"with a Bible in his hand and\r\nanother in his pack,\" but by the influence of his own purity, fidelity,\r\nand uprightness. She introduced, in similar fashion, stories of Rorke's\r\nDrift, of Tel-el-Kebir, and of Gordon at Khartoum. More rarely she\r\nreferred to incidents in her own career, and such passages, one can\r\nunderstand, must have sent a thrill through an audience in which most of\r\nthe Nurses looked up to Florence Nightingale as their \"honoured Chief\"\r\nor \"Queen.\" But when she thus referred to herself, it was only to say\r\nthat any success or repute she had attained was due to faithful\r\nattention to the smallest details. \"The greatest compliment,\" she said,\r\n\"I ever received as a Hospital nurse was this: that I was put to clean\r\nand 'do' every day the Special Ward, with the severest medical or\r\nsurgical case which I was nursing, because I did it thoroughly and\r\nwithout disturbing the patient. That was at the first Hospital I ever\r\nserved in. I think I could give a lesson in Hospital housemaid's work\r\nnow.\" \"I have had more experience,\" she said in another discourse, \"in\r\nall countries and in different ways of Hospitals than almost any one\r\never had before; but if I could recover strength so much as to walk\r\nabout, I would begin all over again. I would come for a year's training\r\nto St. Thomas's Hospital under your admirable Matron (and I venture to\r\nadd that she would find me the closest in obedience to all our rules),\r\nsure that I should learn every day, learn all the more for my past\r\nexperience, and then I would try to be learning every day to the last\r\nhour of my life--'And when his legs were cuttit off, He fought upon his\r\nstumps.'\"\r\n\r\nThe reading of the \"Address from Miss Nightingale\" was one of the events\r\nof the nursing year. Sir Harry Verney, as chairman of the Nightingale\r\nFund, often read the addresses to the assembled Probationers, but they\r\nwere also printed, and a copy was given to each nurse. For the most part\r\nthey were written for the Probationers at St. Thomas's, but from time to\r\ntime Miss Nightingale sent a similar address to the Nightingale Nurses\r\nserving in Edinburgh. \"The Nurses had been asking me only a few days\r\nbefore,\" wrote the Lady Superintendent (Jan. 6, 1875), \"whether you had\r\nremembered them this year, and were going to write to them. Most of them\r\nprize your letters very much. They are trumpet-calls to duty and to\r\ngreater efforts for a higher standard.\" In some years there was another\r\n\"field-day\" for the Nightingale Nurses, when a party of them were\r\ninvited by Sir Harry and Lady Verney to Claydon, and a long summer day,\r\npassed in sauntering in the grounds or in lawn-tennis, ended with a\r\nshort service in the Church. On one or two of these occasions, Miss\r\nNightingale was able to be present, and photographs were taken of her\r\nseated in the midst of the nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nThe high ideal of the Nurse's calling which Miss Nightingale cherished\r\nthroughout her life, and strove to inculcate upon her disciples,\r\nexplains her dislike of schemes of certification, registration, orders,\r\nand other professional organization. She was indeed much interested in,\r\nand she did much to promote, the practice of thrift and provident\r\nassurance among the Nurses.[161] But further than this, in the\r\norganization of nursing as a kind of trade union, Miss Nightingale was\r\nnever inclined to go, and, as we shall hear in a later chapter, she was\r\naltogether opposed to a professional \"register.\" There were those who\r\nmaintained that the problem of improving Nursing was an economic\r\nproblem; that good pay would attract good nurses; that the market was\r\nspoiled by the intrusion of \"lady\" volunteers. But to Miss Nightingale\r\nNursing was a Sacred Calling, only to be followed by those who felt the\r\nvocation, and only followed to good purpose by those who pursued it as\r\nthe service of God through the highest kind of service to man. There\r\nwere those, again, who approached the problem from a point of view the\r\nopposite of the economic, and thought that a \"religious\" motive (in the\r\nordinary sense of the term) was the sure way to good nursing, and who\r\nthus attached supreme importance to organization in \"Orders,\"\r\n\"Companies,\" and the like. To this view Miss Nightingale was equally\r\nopposed, because to her Nursing was an Art, and the essence of success\r\nwas artistic training. A collection of passages, taken from a mass of\r\ncorrespondence, etc., on the subject,[162] may serve to make her point\r\nof view clear. \"The Supply and Demand principle, taken alone, is a\r\nfallacy. It leaves out altogether the most important element, viz. the\r\nstate of public opinion at the time. You have to educate public opinion\r\nup to _wanting_ a good article. Patent pills are not proved to be good\r\narticles because the public pays heavily for them. Many matrons are dear\r\nat £30 a year. Do you suppose that if we were to offer £150 we should\r\nget a good article at once? I trow not; and I say this from no theory,\r\nbut from actual experience. It is very easy to pay. It is very\r\ndifficult to find good Nurses, paid or unpaid. It is _trained_ Nurses,\r\nnot paid nurses, that we want. It is not the payment which makes the\r\ndoctor, but the education.--It is a question of no importance in regard\r\nto any art, whether the painter, sculptor, or poet is a 'lady' or a\r\nperson working for her bread, a volunteer, or a person of the 'lower\r\nmiddle class.' Some thirty years ago I remember reading _Rejected\r\nAddresses_. A gentleman, endeavouring to explain how a certain lady\r\n'became the mother of the Pantalowski' observes, 'The fineness of the\r\nweather, the blueness of her riding-habit all conspired to interest me'\r\n(I quote from memory). We are pleased to hear that the weather was fine\r\nand that the habit was blue, but we do not see what they have to do with\r\nit. I am neither for nor against 'Lady Nurses' (what a ridiculous term!\r\nwhat would they say if _we_ were to talk about 'Gentlemen Doctors'?). I\r\nam neither for nor against 'Paid Nurses.' My principle has always been:\r\nthat we should give the best training we could to any woman of any\r\nclass, of any sect, paid or unpaid, who had the requisite\r\nqualifications, moral, intellectual, and physical, for the vocation of a\r\nNurse. Unquestionably, the educated will be more likely to rise to the\r\npost of Superintendents, _not_ because they are ladies, _but_ because\r\nthey are educated.--The relation of a nursing staff to the medical\r\nofficers is that of the building staff to an architect. And neither can\r\nknow its business if not trained to it. To pit the medical school\r\nagainst the nurse-training school is to pit the hour-hand against the\r\nminute-hand. The worst nursing in Europe is that of Sisterhoods, where\r\nno civil administration or medical school is admitted. The worst\r\nhospitals in Europe are those where no nurse-training schools are\r\nadmitted, where the doctor is, in fact, the matron.--You ask me whether\r\nit is possible to follow out successfully the profession of Nursing\r\nexcept from 'higher motives.' What _are_ the 'higher motives'? That is\r\nwhat I want to know. Nearly all the Christian Orders will tell you: the\r\nfirst is to save your soul. The Roman Catholics will tell you, to serve\r\nGod's Church. But they do not infer that you are to strain mind and soul\r\nand strength in finding out the laws of health. The religious motive is\r\nnot higher, but lower, if the element of religion enters in to impede\r\nthis search. In the perfect nurse, there ought to be what may be called\r\n(1) the physical (or natural) motive, (2) the intellectual (or\r\nprofessional) motive, and (3) the religious motive--_all three_. The\r\n_natural motive_ is the love of nursing the sick, which may entirely\r\nconquer (as I know by personal experience) a physical loathing and\r\nfainting at the sight of operations, etc., and I do not believe that the\r\n'higher motive' (as it is usually called) can so disguise a natural\r\ndisinclination as to make a nurse acceptable to the patients. The good\r\nnurse is a creature much the same all the world over, whether in her\r\ncoif and cloister, or taking her £20 or £50 a year. The _professional\r\nmotive_ is the desire and perpetual effort to do the thing as well as it\r\ncan be done, which exists just as much in the Nurse, as in the\r\nAstronomer in search of a new star, or in the Artist completing a\r\npicture. These may be thought fine words. I can only say that I have\r\nseen this professional ambition in the nurse who could hardly read or\r\nwrite, but who aimed just as much at perfection in her care and\r\ndressings as the surgeon did in his operation. The 'professional' who\r\ndoes this has the higher motive; the 'religious' who thinks she can\r\nserve God 'anyhow' has not. But I do entirely and constantly believe\r\nthat the _religious motive_ is essential for the highest kind of nurse.\r\nThere are such disappointments, such sickenings of the heart, that they\r\ncan only be borne by the feeling that one is called to the work by God,\r\nthat it is a part of His work, that one is a fellow-worker with God. 'I\r\ndo not ask for success,' said dear Agnes Jones, even while she was\r\ntaking every human means to ensure success, 'but that the will of God\r\nmay be done in me and by me.'\"\r\n\r\n  [161] Already in her _Subsidiary Notes_, 1858 (Bibliography A, No. 9),\r\n        she had included suggestions for a \"Nurses' Provident Fund.\"\r\n\r\n  [162] The materials here used are (1) a correspondence with Dr. Farr\r\n        (1866); (2) a letter written, but not sent, to _Macmillan's\r\n        Magazine_ (1867); (3) the draft of a very long letter, to a\r\n        correspondent unnamed, in 1869; and (4) an article for the\r\n        _Nineteenth Century_, 1880 (Bibliography A, No. 103).\r\n\r\nHolding these convictions, Miss Nightingale believed much in individual\r\ninfluence, and little in organized institutions. \"For my part,\" she\r\nsaid, \"I think that people should always be Founders. And this is the\r\nmain argument against Endowments. While the Founder is there, his or her\r\nwork will be done, not afterwards. The Founder cannot foresee the evils\r\nwhich will arise when he is no longer there. Therefore let him not try\r\nto establish an Order. This has been most astonishingly true with the\r\nOrder of the Jesuits as founded by S. Ignatius Loyola, and with S.\r\nVincent de Paul's S[oe]urs de la Charité. It is quite immeasurable the\r\nbreadth and length which now separates the spirit of those Orders from\r\nthe spirit of their Founders. But it is no less true with far less\r\nambitious Societies.\" So, then, Miss Nightingale had little faith in\r\nforms and institutions, and in one of her later Addresses (1888) she\r\nexpressed herself in terms of apprehensive scepticism about the validity\r\nof nursing Certificates and Associations, and of the importance attached\r\nto making nursing a \"Profession.\" It was the higher motive (as\r\ninterpreted above) to which she attached supreme importance, and for\r\ninculcating it she believed that only individual influence could avail.\r\nDid she succeed or fail herein? It may be that, in dearth of inspiring\r\nindividuals, professional organization is the second best thing, and\r\nfills a useful place. Miss Nightingale herself was always more conscious\r\nof her failures than of her successes. But it is impossible for anyone\r\nwho has been privileged to read the correspondence between Miss\r\nNightingale and her pupils not to feel assured that the spirit of the\r\nFounder was imparted to other high-minded women who carried the work\r\ninto many fields. The best of her pupils were the most conscious, like\r\ntheir Mistress, of shortcomings. \"I have failed,\" wrote one of them, in\r\npouring out her soul during a holiday retrospect, \"failed in the thing\r\nyou most speak of, failed in carrying on my Nurses 'in the path towards\r\nperfection.'\" \"But the Master whisper'd, 'Follow the Gleam.'\" Of one of\r\nher best pupils it was recorded that \"she never spoke or cared to be\r\nreminded of what she had done; her constant cry was 'How many things\r\nstill remain to be done.'\"[163] This lady was a true disciple of the\r\nFounder. To the end of her life it was on the path towards perfection\r\nthat Miss Nightingale's heart and mind were set. In her last years, when\r\nher secretary sought to interest her by talk about hospitals and nurses,\r\nshe was never greatly pleased by any record of things well done. \"Tell\r\nme,\" she would say, \"of something which might be made better.\"\r\n\r\n  [163] From an Address by Samuel Benton, Resident Assistant-Medical\r\n        Officer at Highgate Infirmary in memory of Miss Annie Hill (entered\r\n        as a Probationer at St. Thomas's, 1871; appointed Matron at\r\n        Highgate, 1872; died 1877).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                            AN INDIAN REFORMER\r\n\r\n                                (1874-1879)\r\n\r\n\r\n     Never to know that you are beaten is the way to victory. To be\r\n     before one's Government is an honourable distinction. What greater\r\n     reward can a good worker desire than that the next generation\r\n     should forget him, regarding as an obsolete truism work which his\r\n     own generation called a visionary fanaticism?--FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE\r\n     (1877).\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was in one sense never more in office than when she was\r\n\"out of office.\" The passion of her later life was the redress of Indian\r\nsufferings and grievances, and during the years 1874-79, and for many\r\nyears afterwards, she did an enormous amount of work to that end. It was\r\nthe kind of work which a Minister does, or sets his subordinates to do,\r\nwhen he is getting up a subject for parliamentary debate, or framing a\r\nproject of legislation. The _milieu_ in which Miss Nightingale did this\r\nwork was also in a sense official. Her excursions into difficult\r\nproblems of Indian policy and administration were regarded by many\r\npeople as unsafe and inexpedient, and this view was not confined to such\r\nofficials as disagreed with her conclusions. Mr. Jowett was alternately\r\noverborne by her enthusiasm into trying to help her Indian work, and\r\ninsistent upon her giving up most of it. The latter attitude\r\npredominated. Indian land questions were not her special subjects; she\r\ncould never hope to know the ins and outs of them. Her sister was\r\nuniformly of the same opinion: \"What _can_ you know about such things,\r\nmy dear?\" But, after all, how much does a minister know at first-hand of\r\nthe business of a Department new to him? Generally, far less than Miss\r\nNightingale knew of Indian business. A minister either accepts the\r\nviews of his subordinates, or becomes himself a master of his subject by\r\nusing access to the best sources of information. Miss Nightingale, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, had access to the same sources. She corresponded\r\nwith successive Secretaries of State and Viceroys. She was in close\r\ntouch during many years with the Permanent Under-Secretary, Sir Louis\r\nMallet, who, though he did not always agree with her particular\r\nconclusions, was entirely sympathetic in her general aims, and, so far\r\nas official propriety admitted, gave her every facility for pursuing her\r\nresearches. Indian Governors and ex-Governors were at her service for\r\ninformation or discussion. There is voluminous correspondence during\r\nthese years with her old friends, Lord Napier and Ettrick and Sir Bartle\r\nFrere, and with new friends, Sir George Campbell and Sir Richard Temple.\r\nWith Sir George, a frequent visitor at South Street, she was especially\r\nwell pleased. \"Not for years,\" she wrote to M. Mohl (Aug. 10, 1874),\r\n\"have I seen a man in such heroic passion against oppression.\"\r\nAnglo-Indians, when in retirement in South Kensington, are seldom averse\r\nfrom imparting their views, and Miss Nightingale had a retinue of them,\r\npleased to give her information. Those who had inside experience knew\r\nhow much she had done for India, and took it as a compliment that she\r\nshould notice their work and ask them for advice. \"Accept my most\r\ngrateful thanks,\" wrote General Baker, on retiring from the India Office\r\nCouncil (Oct. 11, 1875), \"not only for your very kind letter[164] and\r\nimportant pamphlet, but also for one of the most complete and agreeable\r\nsurprises that I have ever met with. It never occurred to me for a\r\nmoment that my humble efforts for the sanitation of India were so\r\nindulgently watched by the High Priestess of the Science.\" Colonel Yule,\r\nthe member of Council who succeeded Sir Bartle Frere in the charge of\r\nsanitary affairs, and Mr. W. T. Thornton, the Secretary for Public\r\nWorks, were in frequent correspondence with her. On the special subject\r\nof irrigation, she was \"coached,\" not only by a leading authority\r\npresently to be mentioned, but by General Rundall (ex-Inspectorgeneral\r\nof Indian irrigation), Colonel J. G. Fife, Colonel F. T. Haig, and many\r\nother experts. When she turned to Indian education, Mr. A. W. Croft, the\r\nDirector of Public Instruction, corresponded freely with her. Of her\r\nprivate studies, there is evidence in a great accumulation of Indian\r\nBlue-books, Proceedings, Minutes, pamphlets, and other papers, of which\r\nmany are annotated, abstracted, collated. She had, too, a network of\r\ncorrespondents in India. There were in various parts of the country\r\nSanitary Commissioners, doctors, engineers, Irrigation officers, who\r\nwrote to her constantly, and sometimes more freely than in official\r\nreports. There were occasions--as in a dispute, once hot, now as dead as\r\nthe unhappy subjects of it[165]--when her friends in the India Office\r\nhad to admit that her information was earlier and better than theirs.\r\nSo, then, if her friends asked why she meddled in affairs of which she\r\ncould not really know anything, she only set the harder to work in\r\nmastering the voluminous information at her disposal.\r\n\r\n  [164] Miss Nightingale's letter is given at p. 51 of Colonel Yule's\r\n        _Memoir of General Sir William Erskine Baker_ (privately printed\r\n        1882).\r\n\r\n  [165] There is a reference to this subject--of Famine mortality--in a\r\n        letter from Mr. Gladstone quoted below, p. 292.\r\n\r\nYet, all the while, she was \"out of office.\" The conjunction of\r\ncircumstances which gave her much immediate power at the War Office,\r\nthrough Sidney Herbert, and afterwards in the earlier stages of Indian\r\nsanitary reform, was no longer operative; and there was now\r\ndisproportion between her expenditure of effort and the immediate effect\r\nwhich it produced. In this part of her life's work Miss Nightingale\r\nsuffered from some confusion of aim. Her official connections, though\r\nthey gave her the advantage of some good information, interfered with\r\nthe effect of her work as a publicist. Her work as a publicist made her\r\ndistrusted in some official circles. She would perhaps have done better\r\nto confine her exertions to the influencing of public opinion by more\r\nconsistent and sustained writing. The pity of it is, as we shall learn\r\npresently, that the book which she designed as a permanent contribution\r\nto the Indian question was never completed in her life-time. Still, in\r\nspite of all, Miss Nightingale's work as an Indian Reformer, which\r\nabsorbed many hours of every day in her life for twenty-five years, was\r\nnot without effect. In various specific matters she exerted some\r\ninfluence at the time; whilst her personal influence and her writings\r\ndid something to form the public opinion which made later reforms\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                II\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's primary interest in India was in connection with\r\nsanitation, and I shall give one or two instances of her resumed\r\nactivity in this field before passing to the larger sphere into which\r\nthat interest came necessarily to be absorbed. From time to time she\r\nstill intervened, and not without success, to promote the health of the\r\nArmy in India. Thus, on July 21, 1874, the Commander-in-Chief, Lord\r\nNapier of Magdala, wrote to her, enclosing a Minute which he had \"been\r\nobliged to write in defence of the soldiers,\" as improvements to\r\nbarracks and in other respects were \"delayed year after year.\" The\r\nMinute, he explained, was Private and Confidential, but he wished that\r\nthe facts which had called it forth could be used in some legitimate\r\nway. \"I cannot help telling you, dear Miss Nightingale, as I know you\r\nlove the soldiers as well as you did in the Crimea when you broke down\r\nthe doors of red tape for them, a scene which I hope to see embodied in\r\nmarble before I die.\" On receipt of this letter, Miss Nightingale called\r\na meeting of _her_ Indian Council--Sir Bartle Frere and Dr. Sutherland.\r\nSir Bartle made inquiries about the Minute, and found that the\r\nGovernment of India had not yet communicated it to the India Office. He\r\nprepared the ground by informing the Secretary of State of the fact that\r\nsuch a Minute had been written. He suggested to Miss Nightingale that,\r\nwithout using any private and confidential information, it would be\r\npossible to draw up a statement upon measures urgently needed for the\r\nfurther improvement of the health of the soldiers in India. With the\r\nhelp of Sir Bartle Frere and Dr. Sutherland this was done; and Miss\r\nNightingale in Council sent a dispatch to the Secretary of State. In\r\nDisraeli's second Administration Lord Cranborne (now become Marquis of\r\nSalisbury) had resumed his former place at the India Office:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Lord Salisbury._) LEA HURST, _Oct._ 28\r\n     [1874]. DEAR LORD SALISBURY--As you were so very good, when you\r\n     were kind enough to acknowledge my paper on \"Life or Death in\r\n     India,\" as to _ask_ me (where permission was all that I could have\r\n     expected as most gracious on your part) to submit any facts or\r\n     suggestions to you, I venture without troubling you with more\r\n     apology to lay before you the following:--(1) The grasp of the\r\n     Famine is now relaxed, though to make it relax has cost a vast\r\n     expenditure with very little return except in lives. Other lives\r\n     seem now to be in jeopardy from the economy consequent upon this\r\n     noble and never to be regretted expenditure, viz. soldiers' lives.\r\n     There is no greater extravagance than extravagance in lives. The\r\n     Crown Prince of Germany said two months ago[166] (a very remarkable\r\n     doctrine for him) that we could add to the strength and numbers of\r\n     organized armies by sanitary works, and that money well employed in\r\n     these will as much contribute to military force as money spent on\r\n     fortifications and on direct military organizations. A great deal\r\n     has been done already in India, and great results to our Soldiers'\r\n     health have followed; but does not much more remain to be\r\n     done before the results of 2 or 3 favourable years (for there was\r\n     little cholera) can become permanent? Does not experience show\r\n     that, as the greatest saving in outlay is that which can be\r\n     effected in the cost of the military defences of the country, so it\r\n     is the truest economy not to stay your hand in improving the\r\n     military stations and their surroundings until every station in\r\n     India has been put in the most healthy state practicable? In the\r\n     meantime, if it is necessary to check outlay, should not the check\r\n     be exercised on things that can stand over for a few years? (2) For\r\n     in reality points connected with the soldier's health cannot stand\r\n     over. The man is dead or invalided--the man, the most costly\r\n     article we have; and you have to replace him with another costly\r\n     article. Is not every neglect or miscalculation on this point sure\r\n     to add to the national expenditure a far higher amount than would\r\n     be the capitalized cost of the improvements? The improvements\r\n     required now at many Stations are the following.... [a detailed\r\n     list, under various heads of kind and place]. (6) To you it is\r\n     needless to say that this relates to one half only of the Indian\r\n     Army (_i.e._ that under the direct control of Lord Napier of\r\n     Magdala), and that Madras and Bombay have (between them) at least\r\n     an equal proportion of unsupplied wants, for they have not had five\r\n     years of Lord Napier's wise and humane advocacy. (7) In India it is\r\n     always possible to fall into the mistake of spending money\r\n     uselessly. Fortunately, however, there is a way out of it in the\r\n     appointment of Mr. Clark, the great Calcutta Municipality Engineer,\r\n     who has drained and water-supplied Calcutta, to go out and do a\r\n     similar scheme for Madras.... [detailed suggestions for further\r\n     instructions to Mr. Clark].\r\n\r\n  [166] The Crown Princess had seen Miss Nightingale on August 8, 1874.\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Salisbury to Miss Nightingale._) ARLINGTON STREET, _Nov._ 4\r\n     [1874]. DEAR MISS NIGHTINGALE--I assure you we are not blind to the\r\n     importance of the objects which you advocate, nor are we the least\r\n     inclined to interpose any unnecessary delay in their prosecution.\r\n     The difficulty, of course, is money. It is perfectly true that, if\r\n     the remedies were as certain of their effect as the existence of\r\n     the evils is certain and serious, we might obviate the difficulty\r\n     of the money by borrowing without stint. But the consideration\r\n     which withholds the Indian Government from such a course is the\r\n     very fact that the remedies are by no means absolutely certain.\r\n     Take the case of Peshawur for instance. A great deal of money has\r\n     been spent there already, and a great deal more will be spent; and\r\n     yet, if I am to believe the reports which I receive from\r\n     trustworthy authorities, when all the money is spent, it will still\r\n     be a very unhealthy station, and a very small improvement upon the\r\n     death-rate will ultimately be the result. I heard Sir George Clark\r\n     the other day state in Council that one of the new stations in\r\n     Rajpootana,--I forget which it was,--had become decidedly more\r\n     unhealthy since remedial measures recommended by the sanitary\r\n     authorities had been adopted.\r\n\r\n     There may be something of prejudice and something of timidity in\r\n     these apprehensions. I do not wish to give to them more weight than\r\n     they deserve. But it is obvious that in sanitary action we are\r\n     still groping our way, and that we are far from having arrived at\r\n     that point of certainty at which it would be safe, on account of\r\n     any particular series of undertakings, very heavily to pledge the\r\n     future industry of the Indian people. You must always bear in mind\r\n     that at this moment our expenditure treads very closely upon the\r\n     heels of our revenue, and that we absolutely do not know where to\r\n     turn in order to obtain any great increase of revenue. But if we\r\n     borrowed very largely, a great increase of revenue would be\r\n     absolutely necessary to meet the interest of the new debt. However\r\n     great the value of the improvements, we cannot afford to be\r\n     bankrupt, and a new productive Indian tax seems as distant as the\r\n     philosopher's stone. I do not say all this to indicate that we\r\n     shall slacken in our efforts towards sanitary improvement, or fail\r\n     to push them forward as fast as we possibly can. But I want you to\r\n     believe that financial considerations are of some importance; and I\r\n     feel sure that we should only hinder sanitary improvement, and\r\n     prevent sanitary truths from being heartily accepted, either by\r\n     statesmen or by the public at large, if we associated them with a\r\n     disregard of those financial exigencies upon which such enormous\r\n     interests depend. We must not let it be said, or even suspected,\r\n     that sanitary improvement means reckless finance.... But I think\r\n     the best answer I can give you to the details of your letter is to\r\n     send it out to the Viceroy, and ask him to let me have a\r\n     confidential and unofficial report of his intentions in each of\r\n     these cases. I am sure he feels the importance of these matters as\r\n     strongly as any one; but I repeat that no one can thoroughly\r\n     appreciate the difficulties of his position in respect to them who\r\n     does not understand the extreme anxiety that is connected with the\r\n     management of Indian finance.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost, for on January 2, 1875, Lord Salisbury forwarded to\r\nMiss Nightingale, with a private note, the reply which he had received\r\nfrom the Governor-General:--\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Northbrook to Lord Salisbury._) CALCUTTA, _Dec._ 11 [1874].\r\n     I am much obliged to you for sending me Miss Nightingale's letter\r\n     to you, and although at the risk of answering it imperfectly, I\r\n     will not delay putting down what occurred to me till another\r\n     mail--especially as one never can feel secure of one's time in\r\n     India. First, I beg you to assure Miss Nightingale that I am not\r\n     likely so much to forget my training under Sidney Herbert at the\r\n     War Office as to feel indifferent about the health of the soldier\r\n     in India. She knows as well as I do how much has been done of late\r\n     years and how satisfactory the result has been, as is shown by the\r\n     death and sickness returns, and admitted by the Army Sanitary\r\n     Commission and Sir William Muir (the doctor) in evidence recently\r\n     given before a Parliamentary Committee. Miss Nightingale is\r\n     evidently more anxious for the future than dissatisfied with the\r\n     past. The best thing I can say to reassure her is that in the face\r\n     of the financial difficulties of last year I left the expenditure\r\n     upon military public works untouched. It stands for the year at\r\n     something more than a million, which is as much as we can afford\r\n     and nearly as much as can be properly supervised. The year before,\r\n     although most anxious to show a budget which would justify me in\r\n     discontinuing the Income Tax, I gave an addition of £100,000 to the\r\n     sum allotted to military public works at the request of Lord\r\n     Napier. So much for my personal disposition and what I have done\r\n     hitherto.\r\n\r\n     As to what remains to be done, I know there is much.... I quite\r\n     agree in principle with Miss Nightingale's views as to the relative\r\n     importance of different sorts of works, and we should be guided by\r\n     the same considerations as far as possible. But there are practical\r\n     considerations which must interfere with their universal\r\n     application. For instance, in many places in India owing to a want\r\n     of labour we can only go on at a certain rate unless at a very\r\n     greatly increased cost. Again, it is better for many reasons to\r\n     carry out all the necessary works at one station at the same time,\r\n     and these works may very probably include some which in themselves\r\n     may not be so much wanted as other works at other stations. Subject\r\n     to these qualifications, barracks, hospitals, water-supply, and\r\n     drainage should come first, and recreation-rooms, &c., follow....\r\n     Miss Nightingale has evidently carefully studied some of the\r\n     details of our requirements, and is not very far out in her list of\r\n     works. She will be glad to hear that it is not very different from\r\n     that of the works the Commander-in-Chief has lately brought to our\r\n     notice, so that their relative importance is sure to be well\r\n     weighed. Lord Napier takes the liveliest interest in all the\r\n     military public works, and having nothing to do with finding the\r\n     money, is pretty sure to have no scruple in pressing us hard. Some\r\n     of the works mentioned in the list I know myself, so I will make\r\n     one or two remarks ... [detailed observations]. I am very glad to\r\n     hear that Mr. Clark is well enough to come out to India again. When\r\n     he has done his work in Madras I think we may very probably ask him\r\n     to advise us as to the water-supply of some stations. I was much\r\n     taken with the apparent simplicity and economy of a plan which he\r\n     showed me. As regards Miss Nightingale's observations on the\r\n     subject of recreation-rooms and the sale of spirits in canteens:\r\n     the soldiers are uncommonly well off in India generally for\r\n     recreation-rooms and take advantage of them largely. The reason for\r\n     selling spirits at canteens is, I believe, that if not sold men\r\n     would buy noxious spirits in the bazaars. No head of the Army in\r\n     India has ever recommended that the sale should be prohibited. The\r\n     temperance movement is spreading widely among the troops in Bengal.\r\n     By the last returns there were between 5 and 6 thousand members of\r\n     the Temperance Society in the British Army in Bengal (including\r\n     women and children). I have been struck generally with the good\r\n     conduct and respectable appearance of British soldiers in India,\r\n     and think we may well be proud of our army.\r\n\r\n     I have written on, as the subject is one in which I have for a long\r\n     time taken a personal interest, and Miss Nightingale may be glad to\r\n     know that I have not neglected it here. I can promise you that, so\r\n     far as our funds will permit, every attention shall be paid to the\r\n     health of the British and the Native Army in India.\r\n\r\nSuch intervention, as is disclosed in the foregoing documents, was\r\nrepeated from time to time in connection with various sanitary measures,\r\nand was not without effect in keeping those matters to the front. A\r\nparliamentary debate, even sometimes a mere question in Parliament, has\r\neffect upon bureaucracy. In the times with which we are now dealing,\r\n\"Members of Parliament for India\" were few. \"I could have kissed Lord\r\nCranborne,\" exclaimed Miss Nightingale once, \"for saying that in the\r\napproaching elections for a Parliament which is to decide on the\r\ndestinies of 180 millions, the future representatives who are to\r\nrepresent India as well as us had only in two instances in their\r\naddresses mentioned the existence of India.\"[167] Miss Nightingale's\r\nprivate letters and printed articles did something to fill the gap. She\r\nhad the ear of the great personages; they knew how much she knew, and\r\nthey respected her devotion and sincerity. They listened to her, and her\r\nletters often produced the kind of stimulating result that sometimes\r\nfollows a parliamentary intervention. She showed the correspondence with\r\nLord Salisbury and Lord Northbrook to Sir Bartle Frere. \"That Caesar,\"\r\nhe wrote (Jan. 16, 1875), \"should at once sit down and write six sheets\r\nof quarto letter paper, to show he is taking proper care of his Legions\r\nis satisfactory; as proving that your letter moved him and that the\r\nsubject greatly interested him.\" \"The result is just what I expected,\"\r\nwrote another Anglo-Indian, on the occasion of a later intervention by\r\nMiss Nightingale. \"They treat me with contempt, but they don't ignore\r\nyou. The first thing the Governor did on seeing your letter was to sit\r\ndown and write a full exoneration of himself to the Secretary of State.\r\nThe second, I have no doubt, will be to call for his officials and hurry\r\non the work.\"\r\n\r\n  [167] Letter to Madame Mohl, Oct. 31, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nAs Public Health Missionary for India, Miss Nightingale made the state\r\nof the town of Madras a text for constant exhortations. Madras ranked at\r\nthat time second for unhealthiness among the great cities of India\r\n(Delhi being first[168]). Whereas the death-rate in Calcutta and in\r\nBombay was falling, in Madras it was rising.[169] Miss Nightingale,\r\nlike every other sanitary expert who had examined the facts, ascribed\r\nthe high rate of mortality to the deplorable state of the drains; and\r\nthere were Indian officials, both in London and in India, who turned to\r\nher in the hope that she might be able to stir up the higher authorities\r\nto insist on something being done. Her friend, Mr. Clark, had devised a\r\nscheme; either it should be carried out, or a better one should be\r\nsubstituted. On this subject there is a long correspondence amongst her\r\nPapers; and as her principal correspondent was Lord Salisbury, it is not\r\ndevoid of dry humour. Lord Salisbury confessed that the subject was\r\nbeyond him; all he could clearly ascertain was that there were as many\r\ndifferent opinions as there were persons professing to understand it;\r\nbut he had good news for his correspondent. The next Governor of Madras\r\nwas to be the Duke of Buckingham, and the Duke had a curious passion for\r\ndetails. He might be expected, it seemed to be suggested, to take to\r\ndrains like a rat. So Miss Nightingale waited, and presently Lord\r\nSalisbury was sent to the Constantinople Conference on the Eastern\r\nQuestion. At Madras nothing had come of the Duke's love of detail; and\r\nas soon as Lord Salisbury returned to England, Miss Nightingale returned\r\nto the charge. Lord Salisbury sent her memorandum of suggestions to the\r\nDuke, and in due course forwarded to her the Duke's reply (of July 24,\r\n1877). The Governor was studying the question closely, and Lord\r\nSalisbury hoped that Miss Nightingale would be pleased. True, there was\r\ndelay; but then, as he had previously written to her, \"The period of\r\ngrowth of all projects in India, in point of length, savours much of the\r\nperiods of Indian cosmogony.\" \"I think you will be satisfied,\" he now\r\nwrote (Aug. 22), \"that the Governor of Madras is giving his mind very\r\nheartily to the question; and that his previous experience, and the kind\r\nof observations into which his singular taste for detail has guided him,\r\nhave given him some special qualifications for coming to a right\r\ndecision.\" And then came what in a postscript to the High Priestess of\r\nsanitation might be thought a \"blazing indiscretion,\" if it were not\r\nobviously a piece of teasing: \"I was much impressed at Constantinople\r\nwith the advantage of having no drains at all, but keeping dogs\r\ninstead.\" I am afraid that from the moment of the receipt of this letter\r\nMiss Nightingale's opinion of Lord Salisbury fell; but she was not to be\r\nshaken off, and, in consultation with Dr. Sutherland (with hints, too,\r\nfrom an Indian official), she sent a reasoned reply to Lord Salisbury,\r\nto his jest about the Constantinople dogs (erroneously called\r\nscavengers) and all. She had the advantage of knowing all about\r\nConstantinople, and the merits of its natural drainage. As for Madras,\r\nshe thought that there had been \"consideration\" enough (it had lasted\r\nfor more than 20 years), and that the Secretary of State ought to insist\r\non action, in which connection she sent various proposals. Lord\r\nSalisbury's reply to Miss Nightingale did not appear to be promising.\r\n\"The indecision of the Madras Government,\" he said (Sept. 19), \"is\r\npartly due to the fact that various authorities have to be consulted,\r\nand no orders from the Secretary of State will prevent those authorities\r\nfrom differing. But the real difficulty,\" he added, \"is money.\" It was\r\nall that the Madras Government could do to find money for \"imperious\r\nnecessities.\" The implication was that the protection of the public\r\nhealth was not an imperious necessity. A rank heresy, this, in Miss\r\nNightingale's eyes. In sending on Lord Salisbury's letter to Dr.\r\nSutherland, her comment was: \"And they call _me_ a dangerous man!\" To\r\nwhich Dr. Sutherland replied: \"So you are! They tell you a thing can't\r\nbe done, and you won't believe them! It is all nonsense that the\r\nMunicipality cannot find money to drain with, and no number of letters\r\ncan make it sense.\" Lord Salisbury's action was, however, more\r\nfavourable to Miss Nightingale than his letter, for it was presently\r\nannounced in the Madras papers that the Secretary of State had ordered\r\ndrainage works of some sort to be carried out at once. If this were so,\r\nthe words \"at once\" were interpreted with some reference to \"the periods\r\nof Indian cosmogony.\" The scientific drainage of Black Town, the most\r\nthickly populated quarter of Madras, was begun in 1882; that of the\r\nremainder of the town was in progress twenty-five years.\r\n\r\n  [168] In view of its selection as the new capital of India, the\r\n        \"sanitary regeneration\" of Delhi is at last to be taken in hand.\r\n        (_See_ the _Times_, April 22, 1913.)\r\n\r\n  [169] In 1871 it was 28.96 per 1000; in 1874, 37.1. In some parts of the\r\n        town, the rate was as high as 80 per 1000.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's interest in details of sanitary reform was gradually\r\nmerged into larger questions. Recurrent Indian famines gave a new turn\r\nto her thoughts. \"I have been doing sanitary work for India for 18\r\nyears,\" she explained in a letter to Lord Houghton (Nov. 27, 1877); \"but\r\nfor the last four have been continually struck by this dreadful fact:\r\nWhat is the good of trying to keep people in health if you can't keep\r\nthem in life? These ryots are being done to death by floods, by drought,\r\nby Zemindars, and usurers. You must live in order to be well.\" This\r\nindisputable proposition appealed strongly to her emotions. \"My mind,\"\r\nshe wrote to Mr. Chadwick (Sept. 14, 1877), \"is full of the dying Indian\r\nchildren, starved by hundreds of thousands from conditions which have\r\nbeen made for them, in this hideous Indian famine.... How I wish that\r\nsome one would now get up an agitation in the country--as Mr. Gladstone\r\ndid as regards Bulgaria--which should say to the country, _You shall_,\r\nas regards Indian famines and the means of preventing them, among which\r\nIrrigation and Water Transit must rank foremost; if we had given them\r\nwater, we should not now have to be giving them bread.\" Miss Nightingale\r\nhad reached this conclusion by herself in 1873, and it was strongly\r\nconfirmed in the following year. In February 1874 she was moved to write\r\nto Sir Arthur Cotton, \"the greatest living master,\" as she truly called\r\nhim, \"of the Water Question.\" Her letter--the letter of one enthusiast\r\nto another--greatly delighted the old Anglo-Indian. \"If,\" he wrote (Feb.\r\n4), \"fifty years of hard work and contempt had produced no other return\r\nbut a letter from you, it would be an honour beyond what I deserve. The\r\nplot is now rapidly thickening, and I have not the smallest doubt that\r\nyour having taken up this great subject will turn the scale. It is\r\nimpossible for any person not resident in India to conceive the strength\r\nof the prejudice in the minds, not only of the civil officials, but of\r\nmultitudes out of office on both the points of irrigation and\r\nnavigation in India. I am assured that there is not a single person in\r\nhigh office now in India who is not in his heart opposed to them both.\r\nBut we have arrived at a most remarkable crisis now, first in the\r\noccurrence of this most terrible famine, and, second, in the revolution\r\nin the India Office. Lord Salisbury will think for himself in spite of\r\nan Indian Council composed--with only the exception of Sir B. Frere--of\r\nmen of incurable old Indian bias.\" Sir Arthur Cotton's inventive genius\r\nhas left a permanent impress upon India; but he was now _en\r\ndisponibilité_, and he was one of those enthusiasts who, when out of\r\noffice and unable to carry on their plans, conceive the world to be in\r\nwilful conspiracy against them. Moreover, in urging the case for canals,\r\nhe overstated it by too uncompromising a criticism of railways. During\r\nensuing years Sir Arthur Cotton was one of the most voluminous of Miss\r\nNightingale's correspondents. She was fully alive to the faults of\r\nmanner which hindered the acceptance of his ideas, and from time to time\r\nshe pleaded with him for more moderation and less asperity. She herself\r\nwas sometimes blamed, by Mr. Jowett and others, for over-emphasis. She\r\nwould laughingly wonder in reply what they thought of Sir Arthur Cotton\r\nwho gave the public \"strong alcohol,\" in comparison with which anything\r\nof hers was but \"watered milk.\" She had not far pursued her researches\r\ninto the Irrigation question before she perceived that it was intimately\r\nbound up with the Land question. Who was to pay for irrigation? Were the\r\nryots willing to pay a water-rate? Could they pay it? Were not the\r\nZemindars rapacious? Was not the cultivator at the mercy of the usurers?\r\nSir George Campbell was full of such subjects, and Miss Nightingale\r\nproceeded, with his assistance, to master the intricacies of Land tenure\r\nin various parts of India, and especially of the \"Permanent Settlement\"\r\nin Bengal. One subject led her on to another, and she became deeply\r\ninterested in the questions of representation, land, education, usury.\r\nShe became, in short, an Indian Reformer, or an Indian Agitator, at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nHer immediate effort, however, was thrown into the advocacy of\r\nIrrigation. In view alike of the poverty of India, and of the ever\r\npresent danger of famine, she held that it was the duty of the\r\nGovernment to promote Irrigation in every way--by great works as well as\r\nsmall, by wells and tanks as much as by great and small canals--by\r\nencouraging private capital as well as by making great national grants\r\nand loans. The Indian tax-payer was poor, it was said to her; the way to\r\nmake him less poor, she replied, was to irrigate his land.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale began her Irrigation campaign with an appeal to Lord\r\nSalisbury, and she approached him on a point which she thought would be\r\ncommon ground. She knew that he was of a scientific turn of mind, and\r\nhoped he would agree with her that the first thing needful was to obtain\r\ncomplete and trustworthy statistics. She sent him some tentative figures\r\nas to the cost of irrigation works already carried out, and the\r\nfinancial results accruing therefrom, confessing, however, that she\r\nhad experienced great difficulty in obtaining the figures. \"I have been\r\ntoo long on the search for such returns myself,\" he replied (May 10,\r\n1875), \"not to sympathise with your distress.\" He proceeded at some\r\nlength to enumerate \"the difficulties in the way of a really rigorous\r\nexhibit,\" and to state the questions which seemed to him still unsolved\r\nwith regard to irrigation in general; for instance, \"Is irrigation,\" he\r\nasked, \"the creation or merely the anticipation of fertility? Does it\r\nmake vegetable wealth, which but for it would never have existed, or\r\ndoes it crowd into a few years the enjoyment of the whole productive\r\npower of the soil?\" Meanwhile he had her figures submitted to critical\r\nannotation at the India Office, directed various Papers to be sent to\r\nher, and promised to see whether fuller returns could be obtained. As\r\nnothing definite resulted, Miss Nightingale suggested the appointment of\r\na Committee or Commission to investigate and report. The suggestion\r\nelicited a characteristic reply from Lord Salisbury. \"As for a\r\nCommission,\" he wrote (Nov. 1, 1875), \"I doubt its efficiency.\r\nCommissions are very valuable to collect and summarize opinion, and they\r\nare often able to decide one or two distinct issues of fact. But they\r\nare too unwieldy for the collection and digestion of a great variety of\r\nfacts and figures. With the best intentions, their work is slow and\r\n_routinier_, and in their report they gloss over the weak places with\r\ngeneralities.... As a rule, administrative force is in the inverse\r\nproportion of the number of men who exercise it. One man is twice as\r\nstrong as two; two men are twice as strong as four. Boards and\r\nCommissions are only contrivances for making strong men weak.\"\r\n\r\nFrom time to time she jogged Lord Salisbury's elbow, asking whether he\r\nhad yet been able to obtain trustworthy figures, and beseeching him to\r\ninitiate a great irrigation policy. \"Do not for a moment imagine,\" he\r\nwrote (Feb. 27, 1876), \"that I have forgotten the question. The more I\r\ngo into it, the deeper the mystery appears. Every one who has a right to\r\nentertain an opinion on it vindicates that right by entertaining a\r\ndifferent one from his neighbour. General Strachey and Sir Barrow Ellis\r\nhave been engaged upon the matter for years. Both of these assert with\r\nconfidence that one set of statements is true, while the Government of\r\nIndia, backed by Mr. Thornton, our excellent Public Works Secretary,\r\nassert it with no less confidence to be false.... When I am able to get\r\na little light I will let you know; but as long as my oracles flatly\r\ncontradict each other, I am not likely to get nearer certainty than I am\r\nnow.\" As Lord Salisbury was disinclined to a Committee of experts, she\r\nbegged him to procure returns from India, and she drew up a model form\r\nof inquiry, on which particulars might be asked of the extent of\r\ncultivated land in each district, the amount of land under irrigation,\r\nthe cost of annual repairs, and so forth, and so forth. Lord Salisbury\r\ntook the suggestion into consideration, and some returns were called\r\nfor, but nothing came of it for the time. Miss Nightingale then tried to\r\nobtain information in another way. There were, she was told, masses of\r\ndata in the India Office itself, which only needed analysis and\r\ntabulation to yield valuable results. Lord Lawrence had introduced to\r\nher Mr. Edward Prinsep (late Settlement Commissioner, Punjab) as a man\r\nlikely to be helpful in such work. She made friends with him; Sir Louis\r\nMallet gave facilities, and Mr. Prinsep began making researches on Miss\r\nNightingale's behalf. Unfortunately for her success, she had the\r\ncorrectitude to ask Lord Salisbury's permission. Lord Salisbury referred\r\nher request to the Revenue Department, who in a solemn minute\r\nrepresented the serious precedent that would be set by allowing an\r\noutsider to delve in official archives, and Mr. Prinsep had to\r\ndiscontinue his researches. \"You are doubtless aware,\" Sir Louis Mallet\r\ntold her dryly, \"that in the India Office opinions diametrically opposed\r\nare usually entertained on every subject which is discussed.\" There was\r\nonly one certainty, he added, that any decision taken at one time would\r\nbe reversed at another. Ultimately a good deal of information was\r\ncollected by a Select Committee of the House of Commons on Public Works\r\nin India (1878) and by Famine Commissions. Returns, such as Miss\r\nNightingale asked for, are now regularly made.\r\n\r\nSome irrigation works were carried out during these years,[170] but no\r\ngreat forward policy in that direction was instituted. The \"forward\r\npolicy\" presently adopted was of a very different sort. The thoughts of\r\nthe politicians were absorbed in other things; the opinions of the\r\nbureaucrats were divided, and there was stringency in Indian finance. If\r\nthe experts could not agree on the proper basis of estimating the\r\nresults of irrigation, still less were they at one on the kind of\r\nirrigation work that was desirable. Every one was agreed in favour of\r\nirrigation \"in principle\"; but as soon as it became a question of\r\ndetail, whether in finance or in engineering, there were as many\r\nopinions as there were experts. One school said, \"Borrow the money and\r\nthe land will be so enriched that the ryot will be able to pay increased\r\ntaxation.\" Another school retorted, \"But he will be squeezed out of\r\nexistence first; therefore, retrench all round, and wait for better\r\ntimes.\" Or, if the financial difficulty were overcome, engineering\r\ndifficulties were raised. One school said, \"Make navigable canals,\" but\r\nthat meant fulness of water in them. Another said, \"Make canals\r\nprimarily for irrigation,\" but that meant depletion. And so the\r\ncontroversy continued, with no decided impulse from the men in office.\r\nFamines came and went; some works were carried out as a form of\r\n\"relief\"; no great preventive policy was established.\r\n\r\n  [170] _E.g._ the \"Buckingham Canal,\" connecting the canals N. and S. of\r\n        Madras (made as a Famine Relief work, after being \"under\r\n        consideration\" for a quarter of a century). Miss Nightingale\r\n        celebrated this tardy achievement in an article in the press: see\r\n        Bibliography A, No. 99.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was much disheartened, but she persevered. She\r\ncorresponded with everybody of importance whom she could hope to\r\ninfluence. With Lord Lytton, who had succeeded Lord Northbrook as\r\nViceroy in 1876, she was not acquainted; and Lord Beaconsfield she never\r\napproached, except on another matter, and then without any encouragement\r\non his part.[171] In April 1878 Lord Salisbury became Foreign Secretary,\r\nand was succeeded at the India Office by Mr. Gathorne-Hardy (Lord\r\nCranbrook), Mr. Edward Stanhope becoming Under-Secretary. Mr. Stanhope\r\ncame to see her (June 1878); and in the following year she sent him the\r\nfigures of mortality in the last Indian famine, which she had compiled\r\nwith great labour from various sources of information, and\r\ncorrespondence ensued. She saw and corresponded largely with Sir James\r\nCaird, the English representative on the Famine Commission. She tried to\r\nincense Lord Houghton on the subject of Indian grievances. She saw and\r\ncorresponded with Mr. Fawcett. She saw Mr. Bright. She kept up a large\r\nand regular correspondence with officials in India. She supplied\r\nmaterials for lectures in England; and, with skilled assistance, she had\r\nsome maps drawn and engraved, to show the principal works which might be\r\nconstructed. These maps did service at lectures; and Miss Nightingale\r\nalso wrote repeatedly in newspapers and magazines--heralding\r\n\"water-arrivals,\"[172] pointing out districts which famine had not\r\nvisited owing to previous irrigation, and others where similar works\r\nmight be expected to prevent famine in future; comparing the cost of\r\nrelief and prevention; urging the importance of extending education;\r\ncalling attention to oppression in forms of land-tenure and by\r\nmoney-lenders; and generally seeking to arouse public interest at home\r\nin the life and sufferings of the voiceless millions in India.\r\n\r\n  [171] In 1879 the Registrar-General retired, and Miss Nightingale wrote\r\n        to Lord Beaconsfield urging the claims of Dr. Farr to the post. As\r\n        the greatest of English statisticians, and as the senior in the\r\n        Registrar-General's office, he would have been the right man, but\r\n        Lord Beaconsfield gave the appointment to Sir Brydges Henniker.\r\n        Dr. Farr thereupon retired from the Public Service. In the\r\n        following year he was made C.B. (at Miss Nightingale's instance,\r\n        through Sir Stafford Northcote).\r\n\r\n  [172] The title of an article by Miss Nightingale in _Good Words_. For\r\n        it, and other Indian writings, see Bibliography A., Nos. 82, 84,\r\n        90, 92, 97-100.\r\n\r\nThe piece by Miss Nightingale which attracted most attention was an\r\narticle on \"The People of India\" in the _Nineteenth Century_ for October\r\n1878. Sir James Knowles's magazine was then in the early days of its\r\ninfluence, and he gave the first place to this article, in which Miss\r\nNightingale administered a wholesome shock to British complacency. \"We\r\ndo not care for the people of India,\" she exclaimed. \"The saddest sight\r\nin the world\" was to be seen in the British Empire; it was the condition\r\nof the Indian peasant. She gave pitiable facts and figures of Indian\r\nfamines, and passed on to describe in more detail the evils of usury in\r\nthe Bombay Deccan. \"I cannot tell you,\" she wrote to a correspondent in\r\nthe following year,[173] \"the intense interest that I take in the\r\nsubject: how to raise the indebted poor cultivators of India out of\r\ntheir wretched bondage of poverty, whether by _monts de piété_, by some\r\nNational Bank, such as you propose, by some co-operative system, or by\r\nall or any of such means.\" Miss Nightingale's article was received as a\r\nkind of manifesto by those who sympathized with her point of view, and\r\nthe publication brought a large accession to her Indian correspondence.\r\nIn official circles it caused some flutter. \"I have read your article,\"\r\nwrote a friend in the India Office (Aug. 8), \"with the greatest interest\r\nand admiration. The official mind is much disturbed. I overheard a\r\nconversation between two magnates (not in the present Government) in\r\nwhich the article was described as a shriek, and the question was\r\nwhether something could not be done to counteract the impression.\" Lord\r\nNorthbrook, after reading the article, sent to Miss Nightingale an\r\nelaborate criticism, not traversing her case in all points, but\r\npleading that she had exaggerated the shadows. With Lord Salisbury's\r\nsuccessor at the India Office there was the following correspondence:\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Lord Cranbrook._) _August_ 10 [1878].\r\n     DEAR LORD CRANBROOK--Very meekly I venture to send you a poor little\r\n     article of mine on the People of India in the _Nineteenth Century_. I\r\n     hope if you read it you will not call it a shriek (I am astonished at\r\n     my own moderation). I am not so troublesome as to expect that you can\r\n     find time to read it, but the India Office has untold treasures (which\r\n     it does not know itself) in Reports on these subjects which will\r\n     engage your busy time; and especially the Deccan Riots Commission\r\n     Report, on the relation of the ryots and the extortionate\r\n     money-lenders in the Bombay Deccan, will, I am sure, call for your\r\n     attention. Can there be any private enterprise in trade or\r\n     commerce, in manufacture, or in new interests, when to\r\n     money-lenders are guaranteed by our own Courts the profits, the\r\n     enormous and easy profits, which no enterprise of the kind that\r\n     India most wants can rival? What are the practical remedies for\r\n     extortionate usury in India, and principally in the Bombay Deccan?\r\n     The Bill now before the Legislature at Simla does not seem to\r\n     promise much. Does it? The whole subject is, I know, before you.\r\n     Pray believe me (with some wonder at my own audacity), ever your\r\n     faithful and grateful servant, FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Cranbrook to Miss Nightingale._) INDIA OFFICE, _August_ 13\r\n     [1878]. DEAR MISS NIGHTINGALE--Having been out of town for two days\r\n     your note only reached me this morning. I read your article last\r\n     week with much interest; but, without underrating the griefs of\r\n     India, I think you generalise too much from one locality.\r\n     Nevertheless there is enough to stir the heart and mind in search\r\n     of remedies for admitted evils.--Yours very sincerely, CRANBROOK.\r\n\r\n  [173] Mr. Francis William Fox; he had sent to her his pamphlet on _Reform\r\n        in the Administration of India_, suggesting _inter alia_ a National\r\n        Agricultural Bank. Miss Nightingale's letter of three sheets\r\n        (June 18, 1879) is eloquent both of her profound knowledge of\r\n        Indian conditions and of her enthusiastic interest in Indian\r\n        problems.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State wrote to the Viceroy, Lord Lytton, in much the\r\nsame sense; calling his attention to Miss Nightingale's article, saying\r\nthat she had generalized too much, but adding, \"I shall be truly glad if\r\nyour legislation can afford a remedy.\"[174] The Viceroyalty of Lord\r\nLytton was more famous, however, for the forward policy in Afghanistan\r\nthan for internal reforms. Miss Nightingale, as a disciple of Lord\r\nLawrence, was wholly opposed to an aggressive policy which, moreover,\r\nhad the effect of causing retrenchment in all departments except the\r\nmilitary.\r\n\r\n  [174] The letter to Lord Lytton is printed in vol. ii. p. 80 of\r\n        Mr. A. E. Gathorne-Hardy's _Memoir of Lord Cranbrook_ (1910).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale in her propagandist zeal now turned to Mr. Gladstone.\r\nShe made an article of his, called \"Friends and Foes of Russia,\" which\r\nappeared in the _Nineteenth Century_ (January 1879), the occasion of a\r\nletter to him. In this article he had incidentally referred to the loss\r\nof \"1,400,000 lives\" in the last Indian famine. She pointed out to him\r\nthat his estimate was far below the truth, and she sought to enlist him\r\nin a crusade for the Indian causes dear to her heart:--\r\n\r\n     (_Mr. Gladstone to Miss Nightingale._) HAWARDEN, _Jan._ 26 [1879].\r\n     How many years have elapsed since your name used to sound daily in\r\n     my ears, and how many sad events, events of varied sadness, have\r\n     happened in the very place where I used to hear it! All through\r\n     this Eastern controversy, the most painful of my life, it has been\r\n     a consolation to know that I was in sympathy with you--especially I\r\n     remember your most striking declaration about the war against\r\n     Turkey. I am glad that you approve of my article on the Friends and\r\n     Foes of Russia, glad that the error you notice is one of\r\n     under-statement. I had not the means of complete reference when I\r\n     sent off the sheets, and 1,400,000 seemed to me so awful that I\r\n     trembled lest I should be over-stating. The first correction I\r\n     received put four millions--and now you raise it higher still.[175]\r\n     The Indian question under most vicious handling is growing gigantic\r\n     and most perilous. Depend on it I will do what I can in it: but I\r\n     fear this must be little. I fear that--apart from other reasons\r\n     weighty enough--my taking a leading part in it would at once poison\r\n     its atmosphere, now that it has come to be a main ground of the\r\n     controversy between Government and Opposition. When I dealt with\r\n     the Vernacular Press Act last year, there was no Indian\r\n     controversy, and I took all the care in my power not to treat it as\r\n     a contentious question. All this is now changed: and whatever I\r\n     recommend about India the Tories will oppose. You can hardly be\r\n     aware of the extraordinary degree in which prejudice and passion\r\n     have gathered round my very name (as well, I am bound to say, as\r\n     favour and affection) since the Eastern Question came up. Whether\r\n     by my fault or not, I can hardly say: but such is the fact. In the\r\n     line I have followed I must steadily persist to the end of the\r\n     conflict; but I have all along foreseen the likelihood that it\r\n     would probably disable me, even if age and other circumstances did\r\n     not, for rendering any other _serious_ public service in the way of\r\n     acting, which, it must always be remembered, is so different from\r\n     that of objecting and censuring.... The whole Indian question will,\r\n     however, force itself forward, and there will be plenty of hands to\r\n     deal with it. Mr. Bright is coming here in two days, and I hope to\r\n     have full conversation with him about it. Believe me, with warm\r\n     regard and respect, sincerely yours, W. E. GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n  [175] The India Office gave 1,250,000 as the total of deaths in the\r\n        Famine. Mr. Caird, after investigating the question in India, gave\r\n        4,050,000 as his estimate. Miss Nightingale's was 5 to 6 millions.\r\n        \"I begin to think now,\" wrote Sir Louis Mallet (March 10, 1879)\r\n        when Mr. Caird's estimate was made, \"that your 'Shriek' was a\r\n        better expression of the truth than any other utterance.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale continued the correspondence, and presently\r\nMr. Gladstone called upon her to talk over Indian affairs, which were\r\nnow beginning to assume some importance in his general campaign against\r\nthe policy of Lord Beaconsfield. Mr. Gladstone's visit was in May. On\r\nJune 26 Lord Lawrence died, and Miss Nightingale was deeply moved:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Mr. Gladstone._) _July_ 6 [1879]. I see you\r\n     were at Lord Lawrence's funeral yesterday, and you may care to hear\r\n     the story of his last days from one who has been privileged to know\r\n     and serve with two such men as Sidney Herbert and John\r\n     Lawrence--very different, but alike in the \"one thing needful\"--the\r\n     serving with all their souls and minds and without a thought of\r\n     self their high ideal of right. Lord Lawrence's last years were\r\n     spent in work: he did not read, he studied; though almost blind, he\r\n     waded with the help of a Private Secretary (who was a lady[176])\r\n     thro' piles of blue books--chiefly, but not wholly Indian--bringing\r\n     the weight of his unrivalled experience to bear upon them. Up to\r\n     Tuesday night, tho' very ill (he died on Friday), he worked. On the\r\n     Thursday before, he had spoken in the House of Lords on the Indian\r\n     Finance question. The disease, tedious and trying, of which he\r\n     died, was brought on by the London School Board work. He used to\r\n     come home quite exhausted, saying that he could have done the thing\r\n     himself in half-an-hour; yet having entered, with a patience very\r\n     foreign, to his nature, into all the niggling crotchets of\r\n     everybody on the Board. He gave the impression, I believe, of\r\n     sternness in public, but the tenderness and the playfulness of his\r\n     intercourse in private were beyond a woman's tenderness. He was a\r\n     man of iron; he had gone thro' 40 years of Indian life, in times of\r\n     danger, toil, and crisis; had been brought seven times to the brink\r\n     of the grave; and had weathered it all--to die of a School Board at\r\n     last! He had the blue eye, and the expression in it (before his\r\n     operation), of a girl of 16, and the massive brow and head of a\r\n     General of Nations rather than of Armies.... I received a letter\r\n     from him the day _after_ his death--dictated, but signed by\r\n     himself, sending me some recent Indian Reports--private\r\n     papers--which he had read and wished me to read--all marked and the\r\n     page turned down where he had left off. This was his legacy. O that\r\n     I could do something for India for which he lived and died! The\r\n     simplicity of the man could not be surpassed--the unselfishness,\r\n     the firmness. It was always, \"Is it right?\" If it was, it was done.\r\n     It was the same thing: its being right and its being done.... A\r\n     photograph was taken a few hours after death. If it had been a\r\n     sketch by Carracci, or Leonardo, or Michael Angelo, we should have\r\n     said, How far Art transcends Nature. In the holiest pictures of the\r\n     Old Masters, I have never seen anything so beautiful or so holy.\r\n     The lips are slightly parted (like those of a child in a rapture of\r\n     joy on first awakening), with a child-like joy at entering into the\r\n     presence of the Heavenly Father whom he had served so nobly and so\r\n     humbly. The poor eyes are looking down, but as if they were looking\r\n     inward into the soul to realize the rapture--like Milton's \"And joy\r\n     shall overtake him like a flood.\" The face is worn. I think\r\n     sometimes the youth, the physical beauty in the old Italian\r\n     pictures of Christ do not give the full meaning of \"it behoved Him\r\n     to have _suffered_ these things that He might enter into His\r\n     glory\"; or else, like Titian's \"Moneta,\" it is the _mere_ ascetic.\r\n     But here it was the joy arising out of the long trial, the Cross\r\n     out of which came the Crown. The expression was that of the winged\r\n     soul, the child-soul as in the Egyptian tomb-paintings, rising\r\n     somehow without motion (spiritually) out of the worn-out body. (He\r\n     said on the Sunday, \"I can't tell you how I feel: I feel worn\r\n     out.\") All India will feel his loss. No one now living knows what\r\n     he did there--in private, I mean, as well as in public--the raising\r\n     of the people by individuals as well as by Institutions--the\r\n     letters and messages from Sikhs to him, the Indian gentlemen who\r\n     used to come to see him here and treated him as their father. The\r\n     little curs here have barked and bit round the heels of the old\r\n     lion. He heard them but he heeded not. And now he is gone to\r\n     undertake yet greater labours, to bless more worlds in the service\r\n     of God. Lady Lawrence wished to give every one something which had\r\n     belonged to his personal use. But it was found he had nothing.\r\n     There were some old clothes, and a great many boots, patched; but\r\n     nothing else, not even a pin, except his watch, 20 years old, and\r\n     his walking-stick, which she kept. The lady who served as his\r\n     secretary after his blindness had his old shoe-horn, and told me\r\n     this story with an infinite relish of its beauty. It was so\r\n     characteristic of him. Pardon me if I have taken up your time with\r\n     my thoughts of John Lawrence. I felt as if I were paying him a last\r\n     tribute in commending his memory to you.\r\n\r\n  [176] Miss Gaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VII\r\n\r\n\"O that I could do something for India!\" She had done much, and was yet\r\nto do more; but it was a constant regret of her later years that she had\r\nfailed to carry through one piece of work which she had planned. This\r\nwas a book on the allied questions of Indian Irrigation and Indian Land\r\nTenure, to which, in her first draft, she had given the fanciful title\r\n_The Zemindar, the Sun and the Watering Pot as Affecting Life or Death\r\nin India_. Miss Nightingale had first written the book in 1874, and she\r\nhad several copies privately printed. The earliest copies are prefaced\r\nby the following notes on \"Dramatis Personæ.\" They introduce, besides\r\nthe Minister on whom at this time she pinned her hopes, her principal\r\ninformants, and they show the spirit of the book:--\r\n\r\n     THE MARQUIS OF SALISBURY: A real workman and born ruler of men.\r\n     Secretary of State for India by the grace of God.\r\n\r\n     SIR GEORGE CAMPBELL: Ex-Lieutenant Governor of Bengal. Gulliver\r\n     among the Lilliputians.\r\n\r\n     SIR ARTHUR COTTON, R.E.: The most perfect master of the water\r\n     question living.\r\n\r\n     COLONEL RUNDALL, R.E.: Head of Water Department of Bengal, then of\r\n     all India; now at home.\r\n\r\n     COLONEL HAIG, R.E.: Head of Water Department of Bengal; now at home\r\n     ill.\r\n\r\n     THE ZEMINDAR: Created Landlord out of Tax-Gatherer. Growing rich.\r\n\r\n     THE RYOT: Created Slave out of Landowner or Privileged Cultivator.\r\n     Starving. For while \"wealth accumulates, men decay.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jowett revised the book many times, and among the first things\r\nwhich he cut out was the characteristic \"Dramatis Personæ.\" His\r\nunfavourable opinion of the book as a literary work prevented the\r\npublication of it in 1874. \"The style,\" he wrote (Aug. 11, 1874), \"is\r\ntoo jerky and impulsive, though I think it is logical and effective. You\r\nmust avoid faults of taste and exaggeration. The more moderate a\r\nstatement is the stronger it is. But strength lies in paragraphs, in\r\npages, in the whole; not in single sentences. The form should appear to\r\nflow irresistibly from the facts and reasonings. 'What does the man mean\r\nby talking to me about style when I am thinking only of the sufferings\r\nand oppression of 100,000,000 of Ryots?' Yes, but if you want to make\r\nthe English people think about the Ryots you must be careful of the\r\nleast indiscretion or exaggeration. You must make style a duty, and then\r\nyour book will last.\" And again, \"I find myself amid striking\r\nexpressions, but I do not know where I am.\" He told her that she must\r\nrewrite the whole thing before publishing it. He offered to help her,\r\nand drew out a more methodical scheme; but she was impatient of his\r\n\"passion for making heads\"; besides, his heads \"do not cover the ground\r\nthat I must cover, and do cover ground that I don't want to cover.\" She\r\nwas disheartened, and laid the book aside for a while; but at various\r\ntimes during the following years she resumed work upon it. The book was\r\nin two Parts, the first dealing with the Land Question, and being a plea\r\nfor a reform of the Permanent Settlement, with an appendix (largely\r\ncontributed by M. Mohl) \"On Prussian, Austrian, and Russian Reforms in\r\nAbolition of Servitude.\" The second Part dealt with Irrigation as\r\naffecting Life or Death in India, with an appendix of statistical data.\r\nFor the first Part she had prepared a series of illustrations of Indian\r\nagricultural life and customs. Many of the woodcuts were from sketches\r\nby the son of her old friend, Sir Ranald Martin. For the second Part she\r\nhad prepared the Irrigation maps already mentioned. Meanwhile, the\r\ntables of statistics which she had compiled had, owing to the delay,\r\nbecome out of date. Some of her friends--Sir Bartle Frere and Sir George\r\nCampbell and Sir Arthur Cotton--urged her to revise the book and publish\r\nit; and there are in existence a series of proofs, in various stages,\r\nand belonging to various years, corrected by the three friends just\r\nmentioned and by many others. Lord Lawrence too had read the book\r\ncarefully, and one of his last letters to Miss Nightingale contained a\r\nfull discussion of many of the points involved in it. Clearly the book\r\nfirst written in 1874 required in 1879 large revision, and she could not\r\nbring herself to do it. In later years she used some of the material in\r\nother ways; it served, indeed, as a quarry for many articles, papers,\r\nand private letters; but she never ceased to regret that she had not\r\nbeen able to leave in permanent literary form her views on the questions\r\ndiscussed in the book. In her Will, made in 1896, she left special\r\nprovision for the publication of \"such part, if any,\" as her executors\r\nmight think fit, of the \"books, papers (whether manuscript or printed),\r\nand letters relating to my Indian work (together with two stones for\r\nIrrigation maps of India, and also with the woodcut blocks for\r\nillustration of those works).\" By \"those works\" I take it that she meant\r\nprincipally the book written in 1874. I do not know whether her\r\nsuggestion will be carried out. If it were, much revision and editing\r\nwould be necessary. Indian reform moves, it is true, at a rate which\r\n\"savours much of the periods of Indian cosmogony\"; but yet it moves.\r\nThere is a good deal in Miss Nightingale's published and unpublished\r\nwritings about India which might be collected and still serve as Tracts\r\nfor the Times; but there is at least as much which is now happily out of\r\ndate. Of the reform of the Bengal Land System, projected by Lord Ripon,\r\nand carried into effect by Lord Dufferin, we shall hear something in a\r\nlater chapter (VI.). Some of the principal Irrigation works which Miss\r\nNightingale advocated were presently carried out with success, and to\r\nthe great benefit of the country, notably the Swat river canal (1885),\r\nthe Chenab canal (1887), and the Jhelum canal (1902). Her Irrigation\r\nmap, \"brought up to date by statistics at the India Office,\" was\r\npublished in 1900;[177] and maps brought up to a later date are\r\naccessible.[178] Twenty years after the date of Miss Nightingale's\r\npaper on \"The People of India,\" the area irrigated by \"productive\"\r\ncanals had increased from 5 million acres to 9-1/2 million, and since 1901\r\na consistent policy of \"preventive\" irrigation has been adopted.[179]\r\nThe policy of introducing some element of representation and of\r\nadmitting the natives of India more largely to administrative and\r\njudicial posts has slowly but steadily progressed since the years when\r\nMiss Nightingale turned her attention to such questions.\r\n\r\n  [177] In _General Sir Arthur Cotton: His Life and Work_, by his\r\n        daughter, Lady Hope.\r\n\r\n  [178] See _The Irrigation Works of India_, by Robert Burton Buckley,\r\n        C.S.I., Chief Engineer, Indian Public Works Department (retired),\r\n        second edition, 1905. This is an exhaustive work on the subject,\r\n        with maps, woodcuts, and statistics (such as Miss Nightingale had\r\n        asked Lord Salisbury to obtain). An account of some later\r\n        irrigation works may be found in the Engineering Supplement of the\r\n        _Times_, May 21, 1913.\r\n\r\n  [179] Foreshadowed in Lord Curzon's \"Statement on Famine\" in the\r\n        Legislative Council, Simla, October 19, 1900: see _Speeches of Lord\r\n        Curzon_ (Calcutta, 1900), vol. ii. pp. 25-27.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VIII\r\n\r\nOn all these matters, Miss Nightingale suffered much disappointment and\r\nfelt great impatience. The positive and statistical bent of her mind\r\ninclined her to the conviction that for every acknowledged evil there\r\nmust be a definite remedy. She wanted a positive policy, clearly laid\r\ndown and immediately carried out. The attitude of successive Secretaries\r\nof State and Governments of India in the years under consideration in\r\nthis chapter was different. There is a State Paper in which Lord\r\nSalisbury, when Secretary for India, wrote a Philosophic Defence of the\r\nPolicy of Drift.[180] The immediate reference in the Paper was to the\r\nland question in Madras, but its argument is applicable to larger\r\nground: it is entirely in keeping, as the reader will observe, with Lord\r\nSalisbury's letters to Miss Nightingale on the subject of Irrigation in\r\nIndia. \"We must be content to contribute our mite towards a gradual\r\nchange.... Sir George Campbell appears to dread this gentle mode of\r\nprogression which he denounces under the name of drifting. I cannot\r\naccept the metaphor in its entirety, for I believe that there is still\r\nleft some, though not a very important, influence for the helm. But with\r\nthis reservation, I see no terror in the prospect of 'drifting.' On the\r\ncontrary, I believe that all the enduring institutions which human\r\nsocieties have attained have been reached, not of the set design and\r\nforethought of some group of statesmen, but by that unbidden and\r\nunconscious convergence of many thoughts and wills in successive\r\ngenerations, to which, as it obeys no single guiding hand, we may give\r\nthe name of 'drifting.' It is assuredly only in this way that a\r\npermanent solution of these difficult questions will be given to the\r\nvast communities of India. The vacillation of purpose, the chaos of\r\nopinion we are now deploring, only indicate that the requisite\r\nconvergence has not yet been attained.\"\r\n\r\n  [180] India Office Memorandum, April 26, 1875.\r\n\r\nWhen statesmen assume only an unimportant influence on the helm, the\r\nneed is the greater for independent workers to guide public opinion in a\r\ndefinite direction. In 1879 Miss Nightingale thought that her work as an\r\nIndian Reformer had failed; but she is entitled to an honourable place\r\namong the company of clear thinkers who prepared public opinion for the\r\nera of Indian reform which was inaugurated during Lord Ripon's\r\nViceroyalty, and whose persistent advocacy helped to produce at last\r\n\"the requisite convergence\" of opinion in favour of Irrigation as the\r\nbest, if not the only or all-sufficient, preventive of famine. The\r\n\"fanaticism,\" which she shared with Sir Arthur Cotton, is not now so\r\n\"visionary\" as it once seemed. \"Lord Napier,\" she wrote,[181] \"calls Sir\r\nArthur Cotton a splendid madman. And so he is. But all these must be\r\nsplendid madmen who initiate any great thing, any great work, which does\r\nnot recommend itself to the present knowledge, or ignorance, of minds\r\nwhich do not see so far as the splendid madmen of this age, who will be\r\nsensible men to the next age and perhaps a little in arrear to the age\r\nafter that.\"\r\n\r\n  [181] Letter to Sir Bartle Frere, February 16, 1869. The Lord Napier of\r\n        this letter was Lord Napier and Ettrick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                  HOME LIFE IN SOUTH STREET AND THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Life made strait\r\n                On purpose to make sweet the life at large.\r\n                                                    BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\"You live,\" said Lord Napier and Ettrick, in calling upon Miss\r\nNightingale one day, \"between a Palace and a Park, and have one of the\r\nbest views in London.\" A pilgrim who makes his way to No. 10 South\r\nStreet and looks up to the tall, unpretentious house, now marked by a\r\ntablet recording the residence of Florence Nightingale in it, will not\r\nsee the Palace, and may wonder how she can have had any view at all. The\r\nprincipal rooms, however, are at the back of the house, and on the upper\r\nfloors command a view of the Park, across the grounds of Dorchester\r\nHouse--the finest of London's Italian \"palaces.\" Miss Nightingale was\r\nfond of the view, especially in spring mornings, but in the afternoons\r\nshe moralized her landscape. In a letter to her father from South Street\r\nshe quoted _Samson Agonistes_: \"_Eyeless in Gaza, at the mill with\r\nslaves._ Since I have lived looking on the Park, and seen those people\r\nmaking their trivial round, or rather their treadmill round, blind\r\nslaves to it, I have scarce ever had that line out of my head. It will\r\nbe a material alleviation to me if I have to spend September in London\r\nthat the 'mill' is gone. Also, tho' my whole life is laid out to secure\r\nit against interruptions, no one could believe how much it is\r\ninterrupted. And September diminishes this. The _beggars_ are out of\r\ntown.\" How strict was Miss Nightingale's rule against interruption, even\r\nfrom her best friends, is shown amusingly in some notes of this date\r\nfrom Lady Ashburton and her daughter. \"I wish,\" wrote Lady Ashburton,\r\n\"that you would let me sit like a poor old rat in the corner, while you\r\nare at dinner; it is much wholesomer not to eat in solitude; but I know\r\nI shan't get in, so I can only leave this at the door.\" \"Mother bids me\r\nadd a P.S. to my letter and ask with her dear love if you could see her\r\nany time to-day; she will talk through the keyhole and not detain you\r\nfive minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The nicest little house in London,\" No. 10 was called by Lady Verney,\r\nwhose own house was only a few doors off. The proximity did not\r\naltogether facilitate Florence's measures for security against\r\ninterruption. There was underlying affection between the sisters, but at\r\ntimes each was acutely conscious of the other's shortcomings. Also each\r\nthought that the proximity was more valuable to the other than to\r\nherself. No. 10 had been taken by Mr. Nightingale on the advice of Sir\r\nHarry and Lady Verney, who thought it would be well for Florence to be\r\nnear them. Florence, on her part, felt that she was often very useful to\r\nher sister. Their common friend, Madame Mohl, was sometimes in\r\nperplexity to decide which sister's hospitality to accept. \"Go to the\r\nVerneys, if you prefer,\" wrote Florence on one occasion; \"but _we_ shall\r\nhave to do for you all the same. You know what her housekeeping is. _We_\r\nshall have to send in clean sheets, and food, and scrub down the\r\nfloors.\" In one respect, the proximity of the two houses was certainly\r\nconvenient to Florence. Sir Harry and Lady Verney took a willing share,\r\nas we shall hear presently, in the entertainment of Florence's nursing\r\nfriends; and Sir Harry, the chairman of the Council of her Training\r\nSchool, was within easy call. She was not, however, accessible at all\r\ntimes in person, either to her sister or to her brother-in-law, any more\r\nthan to others; much of the communication between them was by letter or\r\nmessage. In later years, however, a morning visit from Sir Harry was\r\npart of the day's routine. When still in full health, he was one of her\r\nchief links with the great world, bringing her its news and carrying out\r\nher behests with pride and alacrity. He was her senior by nineteen\r\nyears, and he lived to be ninety-three. In his old age one of his great\r\nconsolations was a morning call upon his sister-in-law, during which\r\nthey read together in some religious book of his choosing. He was of\r\nthe old evangelical school, but in such matters except in opinion they\r\ndid not disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's manner of life made her messenger an important member\r\nof the South Street staff. She had taken a great and liberal interest in\r\nthe Corps of Commissionaires established in 1859, and a Commissionaire\r\nwas in her regular service, acting both as Cerberus and Mercury. Miss\r\nNightingale's messenger must have been a familiar figure, with his notes\r\nfor Dr. Sutherland, at the War Office, and, for the Matron, at St.\r\nThomas's Hospital. For the rest, Miss Nightingale kept a staff of\r\nmaidservants. Her own particular maid for many years was Temperance\r\nHatcher; but at the time with which we are now concerned she had married\r\none of Miss Nightingale's Crimean protégés, Peter Grillage,[182] who for\r\nsome years had been a manservant at Embley. Miss Nightingale was much\r\nattached to this exemplary pair, constantly sent presents to them and\r\ntheir children, corresponded with them almost to the end of her life,\r\nand remembered them in her Will. At an earlier date Mr. Jowett in\r\nletters written after visits to Miss Nightingale--letters known as\r\n\"roofers\" by \"the younger gown\"--refers gratefully to the care of\r\nneat-handed Temperance. Miss Nightingale took infinite pains in the\r\nselection of her maids. Kind Mrs. Sutherland did much of the work in\r\nthis sort for her, and when she was away in the country Mrs. Sutherland\r\nwas often asked to keep an eye on South Street. Miss Nightingale's love\r\nof method and precision, her fondness for having everything in black and\r\nwhite, appear in many a formidable schedule of duties and requirements\r\nwhich she drew up for the information of applicants. Perhaps these had\r\nthe effect of weeding out the unfit; for, with some exceptions, Miss\r\nNightingale was well served: as was meet and right, for good mistresses\r\nmake good servants, and she was solicitous of their comfort and welfare.\r\nShe was an excellent housekeeper; and here again she brought into play\r\nthe methodical and critical habits which she had practised in larger\r\nspheres. I have seen a book in which a young cook entered the day's\r\n_menu_ and, on the following morning, the mistress wrote comments on\r\neach course--for the most part kindly and encouraging, but sometimes\r\ntrenchant; as in this note upon _stewed cutlets_, \"Why was the glue-pot\r\nused?\"; or this upon a dish of _minced veal_, \"Meat hard, and remember\r\nthat mincing makes hard meat harder.\" Miss Nightingale was a small,\r\nthough delicate, eater; it was for her visitors that she took most\r\npains. Cakes of different kinds, fresh eggs, and coffee used to be sent\r\nregularly to St. Thomas's Hospital, to two wards every week; and meat\r\nsoufflées and jelly were sent weekly to two invalids at Lea Hurst and\r\none at Liverpool. If a nursing friend was coming to South Street, who\r\nwas likely to want \"feeding up,\" or, suffering from overwork, would\r\nrequire to have her appetite coaxed, Miss Nightingale would draw up the\r\n_menu_ herself, and write out her own _recipes_ for particular dishes.\r\nShe had not served in the East with the great Soyer in vain. Her father,\r\nafter his first visit to South Street, pronounced \"Florence's maids and\r\ndinner perfect\"; and the Crown Princess, going down to lunch by herself\r\nafter seeing Miss Nightingale, sent word that the luncheon was \"a work\r\nof art.\"\r\n\r\n  [182] See Vol. I. p. 304.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nOf Miss Nightingale as a hostess, and of the pleasures of South Street\r\nto her nursing visitors, one of her pupils who was often invited gives\r\nthis account:--\"Early tea, if you would accept it, was brought to you;\r\nand following close upon the housemaid, came Miss Nightingale's own maid\r\nto inquire how you had slept; and then to ask if you had any plans for\r\nthe day or would like any visitor invited to lunch or otherwise. When\r\nthis had been ascertained there came, by note or message, proposals for\r\nthe vacant time; and an hour was appointed for your visit to her: that\r\nis, for the visit in chief, for you might have other glimpses of her\r\nduring the day. She was always on the look-out to make your visit not\r\nonly restful and restoring by all manner of material comfort, but to\r\nmake it interesting and brightening as well. If the Verneys were in\r\nresidence at No. 4, Miss Nightingale laid them under contribution for\r\nour entertainment, and right kindly did they both respond. Sometimes the\r\nguest went there to dinner, dining alone with Sir Harry and spending the\r\ntime before and after with Lady Verney, then in some degree an invalid,\r\nin the drawing-room. The conversation there was amusing, relating to a\r\nworld not centred in hospitals, for Sir Harry loved to talk of his early\r\ndays in France and Spain. Lady Verney would sometimes take you driving\r\nwith her, and as she was of the great world you were likely to have a\r\npeep at its attractions. Perhaps the carriage would be stopped while she\r\nchatted with Dean Stanley; or it would pause to allow of cards being\r\nleft at some great house. Then Lady Verney would turn and tease her\r\nguest from the hospital about coming to town in the season and leaving\r\ncards at the French Embassy. Or Sir Harry would include you in his\r\nparty, going to visit Miss Octavia Hill in _her_ London Courts, and\r\nhouses not at all resembling the Embassy. Or he would take you to the\r\nHouse of Commons when the Irish members were lively, and you would see\r\nMr. Gladstone, Mr. Trevelyan and Mr. Parnell, and have an exciting story\r\nto bring home to the Chief. Or it might be that you were taken to a\r\nmeeting of the Royal Geographical Society where Stanley, surrounded by\r\nDr. Moffat, Sir Samuel Baker, and other great travellers, was telling a\r\ncrowded audience amid breathless silence how he crossed the Dark\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nBut these pleasures which Miss Nightingale lavished on her workers\r\nand in which she shared only by sympathy, were not the event of the day\r\nto her visitor. The chief privilege was always the interview with\r\nherself. It was usually arranged to begin at half-past four and often\r\nlasted through several hours; sometimes with a short interval. At times\r\nMiss Nightingale was well enough to come down to the drawing-room and\r\nrest on a couch there while she received her guests. Couch or bed was\r\nalways strewn with letters and papers, and a pencil was ever at hand. It\r\nwas cheerful to find her on the couch, relieved from the imprisonment of\r\nthe bed. She was dressed then in soft black silk with a shawl over her\r\nfeet; always the transparent white kerchief laid over her hair and tied\r\nunder the chin. [The 'transparent white kerchief' was an exquisite\r\nlittle curtain of fine net, edged with real lace, often very fine; for\r\nMiss Nightingale was of the old-fashioned persuasion that a gentlewoman\r\ncannot wear imitation lace. Some of her lace was Buckinghamshire, made\r\nin cottages near Claydon.] Whether sad or glad, there was a bright smile\r\nof welcome. Once or twice I found her with her Persian kittens about,\r\nbut they were soon dismissed. If you had come only for the interview on\r\nbusiness, that might occupy all the time; though even on such occasions,\r\nbusiness might be dispatched in time for other pleasant talk. But if you\r\nwere staying in the house, though business was discussed and counsel\r\ngiven, a wide range was allowed to other conversation. Naturally you\r\ngave her an account of the day's doings; she entered into them with zest\r\nand was led on to other subjects. Sometimes she would speak of India and\r\nthe Ryots; sometimes of Egypt and the Fellaheen; it was rare for her to\r\ntouch upon the Crimean episode: if she did so, it was generally to speak\r\nwith affectionate remembrance of Mrs. Bracebridge. Miss Nightingale\r\nencouraged her pupils to speak at these interviews, and it was a common\r\nmatter of self-reproach with me that whereas I went desirous and\r\nresolved to listen, I had occupied too much of the time talking. However\r\nit was perhaps her design and gave her the best opportunities of helping\r\nher pupils. She listened to all one said with an open mind and made much\r\nof any point of which she approved. But now and again she flashed out a\r\ndissent, in a tone of maternal authority, and gave you a forcible\r\nexposition from the point of view of her powerful intellect and wide\r\noutlook. She was enthusiastic, but she was not a prey to illusions.\r\nSometimes when there was not a clear contradiction, there was a quiet\r\nquestioning. Indeed many of her lessons were given in the form of\r\nquestions. Among our happiest subjects of conversation were the children\r\nin the hospitals. Miss Nightingale seemed never to weary of hearing of\r\nthem; of their sufferings, their home circumstances, their pathetic\r\nknowledge of life, their heroic patience, their quaint sayings, their\r\nbrave fun in intervals of ease, their interest in one another, their\r\nthousand sweetnesses. Not the less was her sympathy given to the older\r\npatients, while the Nurses had, if possible, a still larger place in her\r\nregard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nThe room in which these treasured interviews took place was either the\r\ndrawing-room, or Miss Nightingale's bedroom on the second floor--both at\r\nthe back of the house. The bedroom had a crescent-shaped outer wall with\r\npleasant French windows and flower-balconies. The bed stood between the\r\nwindows and the door, with its foot facing the fireplace, and behind the\r\nbed was a long shelf conveniently placed for books and papers. There\r\nwere always flowers in the room. Those in pots on a stand were provided\r\nby Mr. Rathbone (as already related) until his death; and a box of cut\r\nflowers was sent every week from Melchet Court by Lady Ashburton. The\r\nwalls were white and there were no blinds or curtains; the room seemed\r\nfull of light and flowers. What impressed visitors was the exquisite\r\ncleanliness and daintiness of all the appointments which served as the\r\nframe to their mistress. \"It always seemed a beautiful room,\" says one\r\nvisitor, \"but there was very little in it beside the necessary\r\nfurniture, which was neat, but cheap and simple, except a few pieces\r\nwhich had come from Embley and Lea Hurst. A large arm-chair, in which\r\nMiss Nightingale would sometimes sit, stood between two of the three\r\nwindows. There were few pictures on the walls--a photograph of Lord\r\nLawrence's portrait, a water-colour of an Egyptian sunset, and one or\r\ntwo other gifts. The two things of most meaning were a long\r\nchromolithograph of 'the ground about Sebastopol,' as she called it in\r\nher Will[183]--this was opposite her on the right; and, on the\r\nmantelpiece, exactly facing her bed, a framed chromolithographed text,\r\n'It is I. Be not afraid.' The drawing-room was loftier and more severe,\r\nand on the walls were some fine engravings and photographs of the\r\nSistine ceiling. There were many bookcases in the drawing-room, the back\r\ndrawing-room, and the dining-room, mostly full of Blue-books. As a\r\nlittle girl, I spent many hours in the dining-room while my mother was\r\nupstairs, and can bear witness that except Blue-books the only reading\r\nwas _The Ring and the Book_.\"\r\n\r\n  [183] She directed her executors to place it, with other Crimean\r\n        memorials, \"where soldiers may see them.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Florence Nightingale in her room in South Street from a\r\nphotograph by Miss Bosanquet, 1906_]\r\n\r\nOccasionally Miss Nightingale would be seen standing or moving about in\r\nher room; what was then remarked was the grace and dignity of her\r\nbearing, though the \"willowy figure\" which distinguished her in earlier\r\nyears had now become large. More often she received her visitors in bed\r\nor on her couch. What they then observed was the head, the face, the\r\nhands. Her head, in girlhood and early womanhood, had been remarked as\r\nsmall. Possibly it had grown somewhat, and something must be put down to\r\nthe increased size of the face as affecting the appearance; but at any\r\nrate her head in later years was certainly large. An Army Surgeon who\r\nvisited Miss Nightingale frequently in the 'eighties and 'nineties tells\r\nme that he was always struck by the massiveness of the head, comparable,\r\nhe thought, to Mr. Gladstone's. There was an unusually fine rounded form\r\nof the fore-part of the head just above where the hair begins. The eyes\r\nwere not specially remarkable, though there was a suggestion of\r\nintellectual keenness in them. The nose was fine and rather prominent;\r\nthe mouth, small and firm. The hands were small and refined. Every one\r\nwho saw her felt that he was in the presence of a woman of\r\npersonality--of marked character, energy, and capacity. As her visitor\r\nentered, Miss Nightingale would bend forward from her bed or couch with\r\na smile of welcome; the visitor would be invited to an easy chair beside\r\nher, and talk would begin.\r\n\r\nIn her youth Miss Nightingale was a brilliant talker, as witnesses cited\r\nin an earlier chapter have told us. In later years, too, she had flashes\r\nof brilliance. Madame Mohl, whose standard was high, wrote to her\r\nhusband from Lea Hurst in 1873: \"Mr. Jowett spent three days here. He is\r\na man of mind; I think he would suit you. He is very fond of Flo, which\r\nalso would suit you. She is here, and her conversation is most\r\nnourishing. I would give a great deal for you to be here to enjoy it.\r\nShe is really eloquent. Yesterday she quite surprised me.\"[184] But for\r\nthe most part Miss Nightingale's talk was rather earnest, inquiring,\r\nsometimes searching, than sparkling or eloquent. \"She is worse than a\r\nRoyal Commission to answer,\" said Colonel Yule; \"and, in the most\r\ngracious, charming manner possible, immediately finds out all I don't\r\nknow.\"[185] Younger visitors sometimes felt in awe of her; she could\r\nflash out a searching question upon a rash generalization as formidably\r\nas Mr. Gladstone himself. She was interested in everything except what\r\nwas trivial. Her intellectual vitality was remarkable; visitors who knew\r\nnothing of her special interests or pursuits were yet delighted by the\r\nstimulating freshness of her talk. She liked to keep herself _au\r\ncourant_ with all that was going on in the political and learned worlds.\r\nThe letters to her from more than one Indian Viceroy show that the\r\npleasant gossip from the lobbies or the Universities, with which she\r\nrelieved her discourses on drains, was keenly appreciated. If the\r\nvisitor talked of matters which appealed to her, she was instantly\r\ncurious of detail. \"Yes,\" she would say, leaning forward, \"and what\r\nabout this or that? and have you thought of doing so and so?\" Or if some\r\ndifficulty were propounded, \"I wonder if I could help you at all? The\r\nperson to speak to is Mr. A. or Mr. B. Do you think that he would be so\r\ngood as to come and see me?\" \"I am sure he would feel honoured.\" \"Then\r\ndo you think I might write to him? or you will ask him? Very well, then\r\nwe will see what can be done.\" And so a new network of helpful influence\r\nwould be made. To younger visitors--a London clergyman, it may be, or a\r\nstudent, or a budding official--she would show something of the maternal\r\nsolicitude that was conspicuous in her intercourse with nursing\r\n\"daughters.\" \"But you are not looking well to-day. You have been sitting\r\nup too late? Yes? Then you must promise me to take better care of\r\nyourself.\" Or, \"Are you careful to take regular meals? No? Then you must\r\nlet an old nurse give you some good advice.\" The humour which was\r\ncharacteristic of Miss Nightingale came more readily perhaps to\r\nher pen than to her tongue; but she always enjoyed a joke in\r\nconversation--even, as we have heard already from one of her nursing\r\nfriends, at her own expense. Sometimes she was teasing. A High Church\r\nyoung lady once went to South Street. She was delighted with her\r\ninterview, but Miss Nightingale, she said, \"laughed at High Church\r\ncurates a good deal: she said they had no foreheads.\" She sometimes\r\nquizzed even her greatest friends. She used to talk with humorous\r\nindignation of Mr. Jowett's God as a \"man-jelly,\" in contrast with the\r\nfuture life of work which _she_ looked forward to.\r\n\r\n  [184] _Julius and Mary Mohl_, p. 342.\r\n\r\n  [185] Memoir of Colonel Sir Henry Yule, by his Daughter, prefixed to the\r\n        3rd ed. (1903) of his translation of _The Book of Ser Marco Polo_,\r\n        p. 65.\r\n\r\nIt was in the bedroom above described, or in the smaller room in front\r\nwith which it communicated, that the greater part of Miss Nightingale's\r\nlife for forty-five years was passed. She seldom went out of doors in\r\nLondon. It was believed that occasionally, at times when her heart and\r\nnerves were giving her less than the usual sense of weakness, she went\r\nout on foot into the Park; but the belief was only whispered: it was a\r\npoint of honour amongst her circle to respect her house-ridden\r\nseclusion. The secret may now be divulged, on the authority of many\r\nnotes from Sir Harry Verney, that he lured her out now and then for a\r\nmorning drive and stroll in the Park, especially in rhododendron-time,\r\n\"to remind her of Embley,\" as aforesaid. Miss Nightingale, except in the\r\nfew travel-years of her youth, had little enjoyment from nature in its\r\ngrander or larger aspects, but she knew how to find pleasure in the\r\ncommoner sights and sounds; in flowers and birds, and in London skies.\r\nThere was a tree in the garden of Dorchester House where the birds used\r\nto gather, and from which they flew to be fed at Miss Nightingale's\r\nwindow. She had studied the dietary of birds as carefully as of hospital\r\npatients, and imparted the rudiments of such lore to the \"Dicky-Bird\r\nSociety.\"[186] In the country she liked to have a view from her bedroom\r\nof trees and flowers, and often in the early morning watches she wrote\r\ndown her observations. Her balcony at Lea Hurst gave her a great deal of\r\npleasure. It is large, being the top of the drawing-room bow; you see a\r\nwide stretch of sky from it, and it commands the view described by\r\nMrs. Gaskell.[187] At Claydon she had her pet birds and squirrels, and\r\nused to write about them to Sir Harry's grandchildren. She took a great\r\ninterest in elementary education, and insisted almost as much upon the\r\nimportance of simple nature studies as upon that of physical training.\r\n\"On very fine noondays in London,\" she wrote (Dec. 1888), \"when there is\r\nnearly as much light as there is in a country dusk, the storm-like\r\neffects of the sun peeping out are more like the light streaming from\r\nthe Glory in Heaven of the old Italian Masters than anything I know. And\r\nI wonder whether the poor people see it. And in old days when I walked\r\nout of doors, the murky effect at the end of the perspective of a long\r\ndull street running E. and W. was a real peep into heaven. I should\r\nteach these things in Board Schools to children condemned to live their\r\nlives in the streets of London, as I would teach the botany of leaves\r\nand trees and flowers to country children.\" Cheap popular books were\r\nmuch wanted giving account of \"the habits, structure, and characters\r\n(what they are about, not classification) of plants as living beings\";\r\nand of birds treated in like fashion, and not from the point of view of\r\nornithological classification. \"I had a lovely little popular book with\r\nwoodcuts, published in Calcutta,\" she wrote,[188] \"on the plants of\r\nBengal. The author, an Englishman, offered me to write one on English\r\nplants in the same fashion; but one of the most popular and enterprising\r\nof all our publishers refused on the ground that it would not tell in\r\nBoard School examinations and therefore would not pay.\"\r\n\r\n  [186] Bibliography A, No. 136.\r\n\r\n  [187] See Vol. I. p. 8.\r\n\r\n  [188] Letter to the secretary of the Pure Literature Society, March 30,\r\n        1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nDuring the years following her father's death (1874), Miss Nightingale\r\ndevoted much time to the society of her mother, and this took her for a\r\nconsiderable part of each year out of London. In 1874 she and her mother\r\nspent a month at Claydon (Aug.-Sept.), and then two months at Lea Hurst.\r\nIn 1875 the experiment was tried of taking a house at Upper Norwood, and\r\nthere Miss Nightingale lived with her mother for some weeks\r\n(June-July). \"I am out of humanity's reach,\" wrote Florence to Madame\r\nMohl (June 18): \"in a red villa like a monster lobster: a place which\r\nhas no _raison d'être_ except the _raison d'être_ of lobsters or\r\ncrabs--viz. to go backward and to feed and be fed upon. Stranger\r\nvicissitudes than mine in life few men have had--vicissitudes from\r\nslavery to power, and from power to slavery again. It does not seem like\r\na vicissitude: a red villa at Norwood: yet it is the strangest I yet\r\nhave had. It is the only time for 22 years that my work has not been the\r\nfirst cause for where I should live and how I should live. Here it is\r\nthe last. It is the caricature of a life.\" The lobster-like villa was,\r\nhowever, soon given up. Mrs. Nightingale longed to be taken to her\r\nhome--though, strictly, hers no longer, and from July to October she and\r\nFlorence were at Lea Hurst. The year's routine now became fixed. The\r\ncare of Mrs. Nightingale in London was undertaken by her nephew,\r\nMr. Shore Smith, and his wife. She lived with them in their house in\r\nYork Place, and from July or August in each year to November or December\r\nthe Shore Smith family, with Mrs. Nightingale and her companion, moved\r\nto Lea Hurst, and there also Florence went--sometimes going to Lea Hurst\r\nbefore the others arrived, and sometimes staying there when they were\r\nabsent.[189] Mr. Shore Smith was \"more than son and daughter to her,\"\r\nMrs. Nightingale said; and Florence, during her residence at Lea Hurst,\r\ndevoted a stated number of hours each day--generally two or three in the\r\nmorning--to companionship with her mother. In the country, as in South\r\nStreet, Miss Nightingale constantly had nursing friends to stay with\r\nher. \"At Lea Hurst,\" writes the friend already quoted, \"she was as good\r\nto us as in London. I remember being there once with another of her\r\npupils, and she told us that the rooms assigned to us had been the\r\nnurseries of her childhood. Long drives were contrived for us; luncheon\r\nwas packed in the waggonette, and excursions were mapped out. During our\r\nvisit Mr. Jowett came for a few days; he was very pleasant to us and\r\nfull of kindness. I remember his speaking of a quality in our hostess\r\nwhich always struck us; I mean the thoroughness in all details of her\r\nhospitality, even to putting flowers in our rooms, gathered by herself\r\nin the garden. Miss Nightingale thought one of us was tired, and said\r\nshe was not to get up too early in the morning. Mr. Jowett reminded us\r\nin this connection of the man who made a virtue of always rising very\r\nearly and who was 'conceited all the morning and cross all the\r\nafternoon.'\"\r\n\r\n  [189] As on one occasion when a case of smallpox occurred among the\r\n        servants at Lea Hurst. Miss Nightingale went immediately to\r\n        superintend the nursing of the case, and would let no one else\r\n        come. See Bibliography A, No. 83.\r\n\r\nAt Lea Hurst, during these years, Miss Nightingale devoted herself to\r\nher poorer neighbours, and threw into the task the thoroughness and\r\nsystem which characterized all her doings. She took a part in\r\nestablishing a village coffee-room and a village library, and in\r\norganizing mothers' meetings. She gave doles to all deserving families.\r\nThe _dossiers_ which she kept of their characters and circumstances were\r\nas careful as those referring to the Nightingale Probationers. There are\r\nsheets and sheets amongst her papers, on which she entered the\r\nquantities of each kind of provision supplied to each family, as\r\nelaborate as the purveying accounts which she kept at Scutari. She was a\r\nsort of National Health Insurance scheme (non-contributory) for the\r\nneighbourhood; for she employed a doctor to attend the sick and infirm\r\nat her expense, and to report fully to her on all the cases. There are\r\nfifty letters from him in this sort during a single year, and as many of\r\na like kind from the village schoolmaster, whom she commissioned to give\r\nextra tuition to promising pupils. There were those who thought that\r\nMiss Nightingale wasted on these rustic cares energies that might swell\r\nthe great wave of the world. Among the number was her old friend, Madame\r\nMohl. \"Now, my own Flo,\" she wrote (Oct. 16, 1879), \"you believe me, I\r\nam sure, to love you truly; therefore you will bear what I say, and also\r\nyou believe me to have common sense: you can't help believing it, I defy\r\nyou! Now I declare that if you don't leave that absurd place, Lea Hurst,\r\nimmediately, you must be a little insane--partially, not entirely; and\r\nthat if you saw another person knowingly risking a life that might be\r\nuseful _dans les grandes choses d'ensemble_ to potter after sick\r\nindividuals, and if you were in a lucid moment you would say, 'That\r\nperson is not quite sane or she has not the strength of will to follow\r\nher judgment in her actions.'\" Miss Nightingale was not well pleased by\r\nthis letter. She felt something of the sort herself; but it is one thing\r\nto doubt our own wisdom, and quite another to hear it doubted even by\r\nour oldest friends. Miss Nightingale replied that she was doing her\r\nduty, which was a duty of affection, to her mother, and Madame Mohl,\r\nwith ready tact, explained her letter away by saying that the real\r\nreason of it was only a selfish impatience to see her dear \"Flochen\" in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's mother was now very old; her mind was barely\r\ncoherent; and it would perhaps have been much the same to her if\r\nFlorence had not been by her side. Yet the actual presence was a great\r\ncomfort; and Miss Nightingale, whose calls in earlier life had estranged\r\nher somewhat from her mother, was the more anxious to be with her now.\r\nThere were gleams of brightness in the mother's manner which touched the\r\ndaughter deeply. \"Her mind,\" she afterwards wrote, \"was like the ceiling\r\nof the Sistine Chapel--darkened, blotted, effaced, and with great gaps;\r\nbut if you looked and looked and accustomed your eye to the dimness and\r\nthe broken lights, there were the noble forms transparent through the\r\ndarkness.\"[190] Mother and daughter had much converse on spiritual\r\nthings. At other times, pride and pleasure in her famous daughter were\r\nmixed in the mother's mind with the regrets of earlier years. \"Where is\r\nFlorence?\" she once asked, in the daughter's absence; \"is she still in\r\nher hospital? I suppose she will never marry now.\" She loved to have\r\nLongfellow's poem read to her; \"it is all true,\" she would say, \"all\r\nreal.\" When Florence came, the mother loved her presence dearly. \"Who\r\nare you? Oh, yes, I see you are Florence. Stay with me. Do not leave me.\r\nIt makes me so happy to see you sitting by me. You come down to teach us\r\nto love; but you have so much that is important to do, you must not stay\r\nwith me.\" \"Oh, are you my dearest Florence? I ought to kiss your hand, I\r\nam sure.\" The daughter's wit cheered her mother. \"You have a right to\r\nlaugh,\" she said; \"so few of us have. You are so good--so much better\r\nthan the rest of us. You do me so much good.\"\r\n\r\n  [190] Letter to \"Aunt Mai,\" Feb. 5, 1880.\r\n\r\nSomething of the same impression was made by Miss Nightingale upon all\r\nwho visited her, whether at Lea Hurst or in her upper room at South\r\nStreet. She was often lonely and despondent, and accounted herself, as\r\nwe have heard, the weakest of human vessels, the lowest of God's\r\nservants. To those who knew her well, she was a tower of strength.\r\nMr. Jowett used to say that he never saw Miss Nightingale or received a\r\nletter from her without feeling strengthened for his duties. The thought\r\nof her working in solitude was constantly with him. \"I think no day\r\npasses,\" he wrote to her, \"in which I do not think of you and your work\r\nwith pride and affection.\" If men admired Miss Nightingale, women\r\nworshipped her. To many a devoted woman, who had learnt from her example\r\nand who was inspired by her friendship, she was \"My Mistress and Queen,\"\r\nor \"My Hero Saint.\" Women of the great world laid at her feet an almost\r\nequal adoration, and young girls had something of the same feeling. \"I\r\nused at first to be shy with her,\" says one of them, \"but when I was\r\nolder and talked more freely, I found her the most charming person to\r\ntalk to. She always seemed interested and glad to see one. I always used\r\nto come away with a sort of buoyant feeling. She seemed to raise one\r\ninto a different atmosphere.\" \"I shall ever remember my visit to you,\"\r\nwrote her \"ever affectionate Luise\" (the Grand Duchess of Baden) in\r\n1879, \"as one of those moments coming directly out of God's hand and\r\nleading men's hearts up to Him in thankfulness. It belongs to those\r\nthings which are in themselves a sanctuary.\"[191] And Lady Ashburton,\r\nwho still came sometimes to see the friend of earlier days, her \"Beloved\r\nZoë,\" wrote: \"I like to think of you in your tower--so high up above us\r\nall\"; and, again, \"I am humbled in the dust when I think of what you say\r\nof me--poor, wretched, profitableless me, and yourself the guiding-star\r\nto so many of our lives.\"\r\n\r\n  [191] The Grand Duchess's knowledge as a nurse proved useful when her\r\n        father, the Emperor William, was wounded in the attempt made upon\r\n        his life by Nobiling in 1878. The Empress Augusta sent, through\r\n        Miss Lees, her kindest remembrances to Miss Nightingale with one\r\n        of the bandages made for the Emperor by the Grand Duchess.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nThe friends to whom Miss Nightingale wrote most regularly on matters\r\nother than business, and in whose visits she took the greatest\r\nintellectual pleasure, were, next to Mr. Jowett, Monsieur and Madame\r\nMohl. Her letters to them show some of her more general interests:--\r\n\r\n     (_To M. Mohl._) _Feb._ 16 [1868].... I see Mad. Blanchecotte is\r\n     publishing her _Impressions de Femme_--what is that? Do men publish\r\n     their _Impressions d'Homme_? I think it is a pity that women should\r\n     always look upon themselves (and men look upon them) as a great\r\n     curiosity--a peculiar strange race, like the Aztecs; or rather like\r\n     Dr. Howe's Idiots, whom, after the \"unremitting exertions of two\r\n     years,\" he \"actually taught to eat with a spoon.\"\r\n\r\n     (_To M. Mohl._) SOUTH ST., _Nov._ 24 [1872].... Insensible, cruel,\r\n     aggravating man! you break off just where I want to hear. The only\r\n     thing that amuses me is Papal Infallibility. The only thing that\r\n     interests me not painfully (out of my Chaos)--always excepting\r\n     Livingstone, East African Slave-trade, Central African\r\n     exploration--is Prussian Politics. Not that I suppose you to be\r\n     very well satisfied with them, but I want to _know_ about the\r\n     doings--Bismarck, Old Catholics, Infallibilists--this extraordinary\r\n     conflict between the old man at Rome and the\r\n     Junker-Devil-statesman, Bismarck; also about the struggle with the\r\n     Upper House and the de-feudalizing Bill. I am athirst to know\r\n     _your_ mind about these things.... Have you seen Stanley's _How I\r\n     found Livingstone_? I have desired the publisher to send you a\r\n     copy. It is, without exception, the very worst book on the very\r\n     best subject I ever saw in all my life.... Still I can't help\r\n     devouring the book to the end, though it tells little more of\r\n     Livingstone than what Livingstone in the despatches has told\r\n     himself already. But then Stanley and his newspaper have discovered\r\n     and relieved Livingstone, when all our Government, all our\r\n     Societies, all our Subscriptions, all the Queen's men could not set\r\n     Livingstone up again!... Quetelet has sent me his last\r\n     books--_Anthropométrie_ and _Physique Sociale_--with a charming\r\n     letter. I answered by a violent and vehement exhortation to him to\r\n     prepare his second edition at once--the first (1869) of the\r\n     _Physique Sociale_ being entirely exhausted.[192] Did I tell you\r\n     that when Mr. Jowett was elected chairman for the subjects of\r\n     Final Examination at Oxford, I insisted on Social Physics being\r\n     one?\r\n\r\n  [192] The actually first edition had been issued in 1835, when the title\r\n        of the book was _Sur l'Homme et le Développement de ses Facultés,\r\n        ou Essai de Physique Sociale_. In 1869 it was much enlarged, and\r\n        Miss Nightingale treats it as a new book.\r\n\r\n     (_To Madame Mohl._) SOUTH ST., _Dec._ 19 [1873].... You asked me\r\n     what Mill's _Autobiography_ was like: and as it is a book\r\n     impossible to describe, I send it to you. I think it almost the\r\n     most curious and interesting of modern books I ever read; but\r\n     curious just as much for its nonsense as for its sense. I should\r\n     think the account he gives of his intellectual and moral growth\r\n     from the age of three quite unique: quite as singular as if a man\r\n     were able to describe all his anatomy and physiology in a state of\r\n     growth from the time he was three. But quite, quite as\r\n     extraordinary as this is his own stupidity in not seeing that very\r\n     many of his moral and intellectual, and especially of his\r\n     religious, opinions were fixed inalterably for him by the process\r\n     he underwent, so that all his reasoning afterwards upon them was\r\n     _un_reasoning: fixed as much beyond his power to change, or even to\r\n     see that a change was desirable or possible, as the eyes of a man\r\n     who becomes stone-blind in his youth, or the right arm of a man who\r\n     is paralysed on that side, or &c., &c., &c. He has written me pages\r\n     and pages, which I never could understand--from a man so able--till\r\n     I read his _Autobiography_: that--there being Laws was no proof of\r\n     there being a Law-giver; that--if evil were to produce good, there\r\n     ought to be _more_ of it! Then, you see he says in his book that\r\n     his wife was to be applauded, because she had thrown aside the\r\n     \"monstrous superstition\" that this world _could_ be made on the\r\n     best possible design for perfecting Good thro' Evil!... And I still\r\n     think the _Autobiography_, its high tone, its disinterested\r\n     nobility of feeling and love of mankind, one of the most inspiring\r\n     (modern) books I know. But then please to remember: when Mill left\r\n     the India Office he might most materially have helped all my\r\n     Sanitary Commissions, Irrigation and Civilizing Schemes for India.\r\n     He did nothing. He was quite incapable of understanding anything\r\n     but schemes on paper, correspondence, the literary Office aspect in\r\n     short, for India. As for that jargon about the \"Inspiration\" coming\r\n     from \"woman,\" I really am incapable of conceiving its meaning: if\r\n     it has any at all. I am sure that my part in Administration has\r\n     been the very reverse of \"Inspiration\": it has been the fruit of\r\n     dogged work, of hard experience and observation, such as few men\r\n     have undergone: correcting by close detail work the errors of men\r\n     which came from what I suppose is called their \"inspiration\": what\r\n     _I_ should call their Theory without Practical knowledge or patient\r\n     personal experience.\r\n\r\n     (_To Madame Mohl._) SOUTH ST., _Feb._ 27 [1875].... Do read\r\n     Pascal's _Provinciales_. There is nothing like it in the world; it\r\n     is as witty as Molière; it is as closely reasoned as Aristotle; it\r\n     has a style transparent like Plato. You said you had not read it. I\r\n     have a great mind to send it you. I read it every year (as Lord\r\n     Morpeth said he did Miss Austen's novels) for the pure pleasure it\r\n     gives my imagination. Voltaire said, did he not? that tho' Pascal\r\n     was \"fou,\" he fixed the language.\r\n\r\nNothing that she read in these years pleased her more than Mr. John\r\nMorley's fine address on \"Popular Culture,\" now included in his\r\n_Miscellanies_, which first appeared in the _Fortnightly Review_ for\r\nNovember 1876. She wrote to him to express her grateful admiration and\r\nto ask if she might be allowed to distribute copies of the paper.\r\nMr. Morley, who had already arranged for a cheap reprint, sent her\r\nseveral copies.\r\n\r\nIn January 1876 came the death of M. Mohl--to Madame Mohl an irreparable\r\nloss; she was never the same woman after it; to Miss Nightingale also a\r\nheavy loss. \"I am grieved to see,\" wrote Mr. Jowett to her (Jan. 7),\r\n\"that you have lost a friend, one of the best and truest you ever had.\r\nHis death must bring back many old recollections. Your father told me of\r\nhis fetching you away from the Convent when you were ill, and, as he\r\nthought, saving your life.\" But it was not only that his death revived\r\naffectionate recollections. M. Mohl had a great admiration for Miss\r\nNightingale's intellectual powers. He loved to talk and correspond with\r\nher on politics, literature, and philosophy, and she regarded his\r\nstudies in Eastern religion as a real contribution to \"theodikë,\" one of\r\nher principal preoccupations.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale lost another friend a few weeks later, whose death\r\ngreatly moved her:--\r\n\r\n     (_Dr. E. A. Parkes to Miss Nightingale._) SOUTHAMPTON, _March 9_\r\n     (dictated). Your letter reached me on what must be, I believe, my\r\n     deathbed. Perhaps before you receive this I shall be summoned to my\r\n     account. For what you say I thank and bless you. About two months\r\n     hence the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge will publish a\r\n     little book on \"the personal care of health.\" A copy will be sent\r\n     to you. I had small space, only 26 pages, but I put in as much\r\n     sanitary information as I could, of a very simple kind. I hope it\r\n     may be a little useful to you. It is addressed entirely to the\r\n     poor. And now thank you and bless you for all the support you have\r\n     always given me. Believe me, very gratefully, (signed) E. A. PARKES.\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Dr. H. W. Acland._) 35 SOUTH STREET, _March\r\n     17 [1876]_. The death of our dear friend, Dr. Parkes, fills me with\r\n     grief: and also with anxiety for the future of the Army Medical\r\n     School at Netley. He was a man of most rare modesty: of singular\r\n     gifts. His influence at the School--there was not a man who did not\r\n     leave the better for having been under him--is irreplaceable. But\r\n     the knowledge and instruction he has diffused from the School as a\r\n     centre has extended and will extend wherever the English language\r\n     is spoken, and beyond. Dr. Parkes died like a true Christian hero\r\n     \"at his post,\" and with the simplicity of one. I think I have never\r\n     known such disinterestedness, such self-abnegation, such\r\n     forgetfulness of self. His death was like a resurrection. When he\r\n     was dying, he dictated letters or gave messages to everybody: _all_\r\n     about what ought to be done _for the School_, for the spread of\r\n     hygienic knowledge, for other useful and Army purposes: _none_\r\n     about himself.... On March 9, when it was evident he could not last\r\n     many days, he commended _the School_ to Sir William Jenner and\r\n     dictated a letter to me about hygienic interests, merely saying of\r\n     himself that he might be \"summoned to his last account\" before I\r\n     received it. On March 13 he rallied. I was allowed to send down a\r\n     Trained Nurse. On March 15 he died.... Let us, as he went to the\r\n     sacrifice of himself (he was only 56) with joy and praise--as the\r\n     heroes of old--so part with him. But let us try to save what he\r\n     would have saved....\r\n\r\nThe Professors at the Army Medical School had written to Miss\r\nNightingale in alarm at a report in the newspapers that the institution\r\nwas once more threatened. She begged Dr. Acland, who was a friend of the\r\nWar Secretary (Mr. Gathorne Hardy), to do what he could; and meanwhile\r\nshe took direct action herself. She drew up for Mr. Hardy, as she had\r\ndone years before for Mr. Cardwell, the case for the defence of the\r\nSchool; she added personal entreaties of her own; and she sent Sir Harry\r\nVerney to present the documents to the minister in person. \"Mr. Hardy\r\nlistened attentively while I read your papers,\" reported Sir Harry. \"I\r\nemphasised passages underlined by you, indeed showing him your marks and\r\ninitials. He said that he had not decided the matter, and I replied,\r\n'And Miss Nightingale wants to get hold of you before you do.' I shall\r\ncongratulate you most earnestly, my dearest Florence, if your\r\nrepresentations save the School, for I know that such success cheers\r\nyou more than anything else.\" Three weeks later, the minister returned\r\nthe papers to Sir Harry, announced that the School would not be touched,\r\nand said he might tell Miss Nightingale that he would make the\r\nappointments she had suggested.\r\n\r\nSome unfinished letters from M. Mohl, found in his blotter after his\r\ndeath, were sent to Miss Nightingale by Madame Mohl, who leaned much on\r\nher \"Flochen's\" sympathy in her loss:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Madame Mohl._) LEA HURST, _August_ 6 [1876]. DEAREST VERY\r\n     DEAREST FRIEND--Indeed I do think I was worthy of him if always\r\n     thinking of him, rejoicing in his progress in perfection and\r\n     (formerly) grieving with his troubles and cares (but now he has\r\n     _none_, now he is _always_ making glorious progress, else this world\r\n     is a nonsense), made me so. But why do you distress yourself (your\r\n     loss is great enough, immeasurable, irreparable, for this world) with\r\n     saying such things about not having made the most of him while you had\r\n     him? _He_ would not have said so. You found him a melancholy man: you\r\n     made him a happy one. You gave zest to his life: all that it wanted.\r\n     He always felt this himself: he could not bear to be without you. O\r\n     thank God and say (like the Lord of Ossory about his son): I had\r\n     rather have my dead son than any one else's living one. Who has been\r\n     so blest as you? Where will you find so perfect a man? And you felt\r\n     it, I know you did. And he felt your feeling it.... For M. Mohl's\r\n     glorious life on earth I thank God: but I thank Him yet more,\r\n     because this was only a beginning of life infinitely more\r\n     glorious--as Milton says: \"death, called life, which us _from life_\r\n     doth sever.\" Fare you well. May God be with us all. Your old Flo.\r\n     It is 20 years to-day since I came back from the Crimea. It is 15\r\n     since I lost Sidney Herbert.\r\n\r\n     (_To the same._) SOUTH ST., _Feb._ 7 [1878]. DEAREST FRIEND, EVER\r\n     DEAREST--Indeed I do: I think daily and nightly of him and of you: the\r\n     world is darker every year to me, and darker without him: for it seems\r\n     as if a great light were gone out of it. And the people who survive\r\n     seem so weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable compared with those I\r\n     knew once, loved once.... No: we shan't give a doit to help the Turks.\r\n     What! crush all those struggling young peoples, Sclav and Greek,\r\n     back under the hideous massacres and oppression and corruption of\r\n     the Turk? We could not if we would. I don't feel very hopeful: for\r\n     the worst Eurasian Government, we are allowing the worst European\r\n     Government to substitute itself. Turkey was falling to pieces\r\n     anyhow by its own bad weight; and we should not have let Russia act\r\n     alone in the coming freedom. May God give liberty to the Christian\r\n     provinces to work out _their own_ salvation!\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's interest in the Eastern Question, moved by the\r\nTurkish atrocities in Bulgaria, had been heightened by her close\r\nfriendship with Miss Paulina Irby. Of the women friends whom Miss\r\nNightingale saw frequently, and with whom she corresponded regularly,\r\nMiss Irby was one of the few who could in any intellectual and spiritual\r\nsense be called her equal. Miss Irby was a woman of the highest\r\ncultivation, an excellent scholar; a woman of most generous kindliness\r\nand simplicity of mind who truly thought no evil.[193] There was a sort\r\nof innocence in her that seemed to disperse difficulties of itself, and\r\nMiss Nightingale's papers contain references to occasions on which Miss\r\nIrby's friendly offices resolved many worries. She was a friend of\r\nMr. and Mrs. Nightingale, and Florence had first met her at Embley in\r\n1869. She was one of the many women who revered the name of Florence\r\nNightingale, and she had spent some months at Kaiserswerth. She was\r\nenraptured by making the personal acquaintance of her heroine, and was\r\nused to say henceforth that any good she was able to do was owing to\r\nMiss Nightingale's example and sympathy. The good that Miss Irby did was\r\ngreat; in promoting education among the Sclavonic Christians of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, and in relieving the distress among orphans and\r\nrefugees. During the years 1874-79 Miss Irby was often in England, to\r\ncollect funds and for other purposes connected with her work in the\r\nEast. Miss Nightingale helped her much therein, and thus became very\r\nfamiliar with some aspects of the Eastern Question. This interest,\r\ncombined with her detestation of the forward policy on the Indian\r\nfrontier, formed a link of sympathy with Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n  [193] It is unfortunate that no record of this admirable woman exists\r\n        except a slight article in one of the Reviews. Her letters were, I\r\n        am told, destroyed at her death in 1912; those from Miss\r\n        Nightingale among the rest. A very large number of letters from\r\n        Miss Irby is preserved among Miss Nightingale's papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VII\r\n\r\nWas Miss Nightingale's life happy or unhappy? Her sister used to say to\r\nher, thinking of her many political acquaintances: \"You lead such an\r\ninteresting life.\" Mr. Jowett told her that her life was a blessed one,\r\nand that she ought so to think it. He always sent her a New Year's\r\nletter, and on the last day of 1879 he wrote to her thus:--\r\n\r\n     (_Benjamin Jowett to Miss Nightingale._) I cannot let the new year\r\n     begin without sending my best and kindest wishes for you and for\r\n     your work: I can only desire that you should go on as you are\r\n     doing, in your own way. Lessening human suffering and speaking for\r\n     those who cannot make their voices heard, with less of suffering to\r\n     yourself, if this, as I fear, be not a necessary condition of the\r\n     life you have chosen. There was a great deal of romantic feeling\r\n     about you 23 years ago when you came home from the Crimea (I really\r\n     believe that you might have been a Duchess if you had played your\r\n     cards better!). And now you work on in silence, and nobody knows\r\n     how many lives are saved by your nurses in hospitals (you have\r\n     introduced a new era in nursing); how many thousand soldiers who\r\n     would have fallen victims to bad air, bad water, bad drainage and\r\n     ventilation, are now alive owing to your forethought and diligence;\r\n     how many natives of India (they might be counted probably by\r\n     hundreds of thousands) in this generation and in generations to\r\n     come have been preserved from famine and oppression and the load of\r\n     debt by the energy of a sick lady who can scarcely rise from her\r\n     bed. The world does not know all this or think about it. But I know\r\n     it and often think about it, and I want you to, so that in the\r\n     later years of your course you may see (with a side of sorrow) what\r\n     a blessed life yours is and has been. Is there anything which you\r\n     could do, or would wish to do, other than you are doing? though you\r\n     are overtaxed and have a feeling of oppression at the load which\r\n     rests upon you. I think that the romance, too, which is with the\r\n     past, did a great deal of good. Like Dr. Pusey, you are a Myth in\r\n     your own life-time. Do you know that there are thousands of girls\r\n     about the ages of 18 to 23 named after you? As you once said to me\r\n     \"the world has not been unkind.\" Everybody has heard of you and has\r\n     a sweet association with your name. It is about 17 years since we\r\n     first became friends. How can I thank you properly for all your\r\n     kindness and sympathy--never failing--when you had so many other\r\n     things to occupy your mind? I have not been able to do so much as\r\n     you expected of me, and probably never shall be, though I do not\r\n     give up ambition. But I have been too much distracted by many\r\n     things; and not strong enough for the place. I shall go on as\r\n     quietly and industriously as I can. If I ever do much more, it will\r\n     be chiefly owing to you: your friendship has strengthened and\r\n     helped me, and never been a source of the least pain or regret.\r\n     Farewell. May the later years of your life be clearer and happier\r\n     and more useful than the earlier! If you will believe it, this may\r\n     be so.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Jowett's example, his friend found strength and help, even as he\r\ndid in hers. \"He offers himself up to Oxford,\" she used to say of him\r\nwith admiration; and she offered up all her powers to the causes she had\r\nespoused. There were still to be many years during which she was able to\r\nwork unceasingly for them. Her life was to be not less useful than\r\nbefore, and perhaps, as increasing years brought greater calm, her life\r\nwas also clearer. But happiness, as the world accounts it, she neither\r\nattained nor desired. She had a friend who was losing his devotion to\r\nhigh ideals, as she thought, in domestic contentment. \"O Happiness,\" she\r\nsaid of him, \"like the bread-tree fruit, what a corrupter and paralyser\r\nof human nature thou art!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                       LORD RIPON AND GENERAL GORDON\r\n\r\n                                (1880-1885)\r\n\r\n\r\n     I thank God for all He is doing in India through Lord\r\n     Ripon.--FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE (1884).\r\n\r\n     General Gordon was the bravest of men where God's cause and that of\r\n     others was concerned, and his courage rose with loneliness. He was\r\n     the meekest of men where himself only was concerned. You could not\r\n     say he was the most unselfish of men: he had no self.--FLORENCE\r\n     NIGHTINGALE (1886).\r\n\r\n\"SOUTH STREET, _Feb._ 2 [1880]. DEAREST--My dear mother fell asleep just\r\nafter midnight, after much weariness and painfulness. The last three\r\nhours were in beautiful peace and all through she had been able to\r\nlisten to and to repeat her favourite hymns and prayers, and to smile a\r\nsmile as if she said, 'I'm dying: it's all right.' Then she composed her\r\nown self to death at 9 last night: folded her hands: closed her own\r\neyes: laid herself down, and in three hours she was gone to a Greater\r\nLove than ours.... Do you remember what Ezekiel says: 'And at eve my\r\nwife died: and I did in the morning as I was commanded.'\"[194] Miss\r\nNightingale's mother had almost completed her 93rd year. Queen Victoria\r\nsent a message of sympathy to which Miss Nightingale replied with\r\nparticulars of the last hours such as Her Majesty was known to like, and\r\nshe asked leave to address a letter to the Empress of India on the\r\ncondition of that country. Permission was granted, and \"doing in the\r\nmorning as she was commanded\" Miss Nightingale turned from thoughts of\r\nher mother's death to the grievances of the Indian peoples and composed\r\nin general terms a plea for their redress. The Queen made no response,\r\nbut presently she sent a copy of the _Life of the Prince Consort_. The\r\n_Life_ contains much information about the famous Proclamation to the\r\nPeople of India, in which the Queen and the Prince Consort had been\r\npersonally concerned, and Miss Nightingale made use of the fact when she\r\nnext had an opportunity of addressing her Sovereign on Indian subjects.\r\n\r\n  [194] Letter to Miss Pringle.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Miss Nightingale was suffering from nervous collapse, and the\r\ndoctors ordered sea air. She went for three weeks to the Granville\r\nHotel, Ramsgate, but the change did her little good. \"The doctors tell\r\nme,\" she wrote to Miss Pringle (March 28), \"I must be 'free' for at\r\nleast a year 'from the responsibilities which have been forced upon me'\r\n(and which, they might say, I have so ill fulfilled) and from 'letters.'\r\nBut when is that year to come? I believe, however, I must go away again\r\nfor a time, if only to work up the arrears of my Indian work, which\r\nweigh heavily on my mind.\" She went in April for a few weeks to Seaton,\r\nwhere Lady Ashburton had placed Seaforth Lodge at her disposal. She was\r\nnot to be disturbed, but her hostess came from Melchet for a few days,\r\nand had, as she wrote, \"the deep joy of communion with my beloved.\" In\r\nthe following month Miss Nightingale spent some days at Claydon, where\r\nin subsequent years she often stayed for a longer time, taking much\r\ninterest in local affairs there. Her sister was now and henceforth an\r\ninvalid, suffering sadly from rheumatic arthritis. Nothing cheered her\r\nso much, said Sir Harry Verney, as her sister's society, and now that\r\nMrs. Nightingale's death made visits to Lea Hurst less imperative they\r\nhoped that Florence \"would treat Claydon more as a home\" than\r\nheretofore. She did as she was bidden, and for several years paid an\r\nannual visit to Claydon, where \"Florence Nightingale's room\" is still\r\nshown. For the rest, Miss Nightingale's life continued on the old\r\nlines,[195] and whether at Claydon or in South Street the Sabbatical\r\nyear of freedom from responsibilities, letters, interviews, and\r\nBlue-books did not come.\r\n\r\n  [195] Except that in March 1881 she spent ten days at the Seaford Bay\r\n        Hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1880, Miss Nightingale was intensely interested in the\r\nelections. Her dislike of Lord Beaconsfield's policy, her recent\r\nintercourse with Mr. Gladstone, her hopes for India, her interest in the\r\nVerneys, as well as her own sympathy with liberal ideas and the\r\nLiberalism traditional in her family, made her a stout partisan. \"I\r\nhope, dearest,\" she wrote to a nursing friend (March 28), \"you care\r\nabout the elections. You are in the thick of them. Sir Harry with\r\npatriotic pluck is in his 79th year fighting a losing battle at\r\nBuckingham.[196] But what delights me is that the Liberal side find that\r\nthe labourers and the working man have waked up during the last 6 years\r\nto interests entirely new to them. Then, 6 years ago, we could hardly\r\nget a hearing: now men jam themselves into small hot rooms, struggling\r\nfor standing-room while for 3 hours they listen to political talk.\r\nWhether we win or not, such interest will never die.\" When the Liberal\r\nvictory was complete, she was eager, like the rest of the political\r\nworld, to know who would be Prime Minister, and more anxious than other\r\npeople (except the few personally concerned) to know who would succeed\r\nLord Lytton as Viceroy of India. Sir Harry Verney sent her the latest\r\nrumours from the Row in the morning and from the Clubs in the afternoon.\r\nShe must have been greatly pleased when Lord Ripon's appointment to\r\nIndia was announced; but curiously there is no note about it, nor any\r\nrecord of a visit from him, nor at this stage any correspondence. They\r\nwere, however, old friends; and as soon as Lord Ripon set to work in\r\nIndia, correspondence, at once cordial and confidential, began. Advocacy\r\nof Lord Ripon's Indian policy was indeed one of the absorbing interests\r\nwhich occupied Miss Nightingale during the years covered in the present\r\nchapter. Her other main preoccupation was the state of the Army\r\nMedical and Hospital service--a matter which became urgent in connection\r\nwith the campaigns in South Africa, Egypt, and the Soudan.\r\n\r\n  [196] Sir Harry, however, won the battle.\r\n\r\nThese two branches of work now occupied the front; but they did not\r\ncause Miss Nightingale to abandon other responsibilities, and the\r\nreader must supply a background of the various kinds of work described\r\nin earlier chapters. She was still busy with details of Indian\r\nsanitation, for the _Sanitary Annual_ was still submitted to her\r\nrevision. She was still consulted on questions of nursing administration\r\nand hospital construction. \"They are in difficulties,\" wrote Sir Harry\r\nVerney (Jan. 30, 1881), in forwarding an application of this kind; \"so\r\nthey appeal to you--the Family Solicitor to whom we all turn when we get\r\ninto a scrape, but your Family is a large one--the whole human race.\"\r\nShe still filled the part of Lady Bountiful, with more than that lady's\r\nusual care for detail, to her poorer neighbours in the country. The\r\nWorking-Men's Institute at Holloway (near Lea Hurst) referred to her the\r\nquestion whether playing-cards should be admitted. She was in favour of\r\nthe cards, but a majority of the Committee were against them, and,\r\nbefore giving her opinion, she conducted an inquiry as elaborate and\r\nfar-searching as if it were a case of cholera. And more assiduously,\r\nrather than less, did she devote herself to the affairs of the\r\nNightingale School and its old pupils. There are years at this period\r\nduring which as many as 400 letters from nurses were preserved in this\r\nsort, and there are Sisters to each of whom more than fifty letters were\r\nwritten. She introduced the innovation of sending her probationers to\r\nthe National Training School of Cookery, and she looked over their notes\r\non the lessons, founding thereon hints to the teachers. The extension of\r\ntrained nursing in workhouse infirmaries called for more Nightingale\r\nnurses. \"Yesterday,\" she wrote to Madame Mohl (June 30, 1881), \"we\r\nopened the new Marylebone Infirmary (760 beds). We nurse it with our\r\ntrained nurses, thank God! I have each of these women to see for three\r\nor four hours alone before she begins work.\" It was during this period\r\nthat Miss Nightingale paid her first visit to the new St. Thomas's\r\nHospital. She drove there on January 27, 1882, and inspected the\r\nquarters of her Training School and one of the Hospital wards. \"Just one\r\nweek has elapsed,\" wrote the Matron (Feb. 4), \"since you honoured us\r\nwith your more than welcome presence, and I cannot go to bed to-night\r\nuntil I have thanked you for all the admiration in which you speak of\r\n_your Home_ and the pretty Alexandra Ward. No words of mine can ever\r\nexpress the delight it gave us to welcome you, our dearly loved Chief,\r\nto the Home and School which has for more than 20 years borne 'her\r\nhonoured name.'\" The time was drawing near when pupils of the School\r\nwere to follow in the footsteps of their Chief and do nursing service in\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nIn April 1880 a notable addition was made to Miss Nightingale's hero\r\nfriends. General Gordon introduced himself to her in order to introduce\r\nhis cousin, Mrs. Hawthorn. She was the wife of a Colonel in the\r\nEngineers, and devoted herself to good work in military hospitals. She\r\nhad been painfully impressed by the inefficiency of the orderlies, and\r\nhad begged General Gordon to \"go to Miss Nightingale\" in the matter. The\r\ncharacter of \"Chinese Gordon\" was already most sympathetic to Miss\r\nNightingale, and the personal touch now heightened her admiration. She\r\ngained at the same time in his cousin a friend to whom she became warmly\r\nattached, and who served as eyes and ears for her in a way which enabled\r\nher to forward useful reforms. General Gordon's letters appealed\r\nstrongly to Miss Nightingale as those of a kindred soul:--\r\n\r\n     (_General Gordon to Miss Nightingale._) _April_ 22 [1880]. In these\r\n     days when so much is talked of the prestige of England, &c., &c. I\r\n     cannot help feeling a bitter sentiment when one considers how\r\n     little we care for those near and how we profess to care for those\r\n     afar off. You wrote some kind words on your card when I called, and\r\n     I am much obliged for them, but I do not think that I have done\r\n     1/20 part or suffered anything like the nurse of a hospital who,\r\n     forgotten by the world, drudges on in obscurity. (_April_ 29.) I do\r\n     not know the details myself. I took up the paper on the entreaties\r\n     of my cousin, feeling sure that the truest way to gain recruits to\r\n     our army would be by so remedying the defects and alleviating the\r\n     sufferings of soldiers that universally should it be acknowledged\r\n     that the soldier is cared for in every way. Decorations may\r\n     popularise the army to the few, but proper and considerate\r\n     attention to the many is needed to do so to the public. To my mind\r\n     it is astonishing how great people, who have all the power to\r\n     remedy these little defects, who pride themselves on the prestige\r\n     of our name, whose time must hang so very heavily on their hands,\r\n     can remain year after year heedless of the sick and afflicted. I\r\n     speak from experience when I say that both in China and Soudan, I\r\n     gained the hearts of my soldiers (who would do anything for me) not\r\n     by my justice, &c., but by looking after them when sick and\r\n     wounded, and by continually visiting the Hospitals.... [If you\r\n     cannot help us] well! I fall back on my verse \"If thou seest the\r\n     oppression of the poor and violent perversity of judgment marvel\r\n     not at it, for He that is higher than the Highest regardeth it.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale took the matter up at once. She put the case into form,\r\nand submitted it, through Sir Harry Verney, to the Secretary for War,\r\nMr. Childers, who promised to look into it. Presently he called for a\r\nreport on hospital nursing by orderlies, and in August the Departmental\r\nanswer was forwarded to Miss Nightingale. \"I have seen such answers,\"\r\nshe wrote,[197] \"at the Crimean war time. 'The patient has died of\r\nneglect and want of proper attendance; but by Regulations should not\r\nhave died; therefore the allegation that he is dead is disposed of.'\" In\r\nthis case the allegations were not disposed of, as we shall hear\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n  [197] To Captain Galton, August 21, 1880.\r\n\r\nEarly in May General Gordon left England as private secretary to Lord\r\nRipon, and before starting he sent one of his \"little books of comfort\"\r\nto Miss Nightingale. He resigned the incongruous appointment almost as\r\nsoon as he had reached India, and after a special mission in China\r\nreturned to England. He saw Miss Nightingale and announced his intention\r\nof going to Syria. Miss Nightingale upbraided him. His past claimed more\r\nof his future than a tour of curiosity in the East. Why should he not\r\nreturn to India in an unofficial character? She could tell him of much\r\nwork to do there:--\r\n\r\n     (_General Gordon to Miss Nightingale._) SOUTHAMPTON, _April_ 4\r\n     [1881]. You have written most kindly and far too highly of me, for\r\n     I find no responding tone in my heart to make me claim such praise.\r\n     I will explain exactly how I am situated. I consider my life done,\r\n     that I can never aspire to or seek employment, when one's voice\r\n     must be stilled to some particular note; therefore I say _it_ is done,\r\n     and the only thing now left to me is to drift along to its natural end\r\n     and in the endeavour to do what little good one may be able to do.\r\n     Syria is, to me, no land of attraction, all lands are indifferent. I\r\n     go for no desire of curiosity, but simply because it is a quiet land\r\n     and a land where small means can do much good. That is all my reason\r\n     for going there. I would have gone to the Cape. I would have gone to\r\n     India as you suggest, but I would never do so if I had to accept the\r\n     shibboleth of the Indian or Colonial official classes.... My life\r\n     is truly to me a straw, but I must live. Would that it could go to\r\n     give you and all others the sense that they are all risen in Christ\r\n     even now, even if it was at the cost of my eternal existence--such\r\n     is the love I have for my fellow-creatures, but the door is shut. I\r\n     cannot live in England; for though I have many many millions in my\r\n     Home, I am only put on short allowance here, tho' it is ample for\r\n     me with my wants. I cannot visit the sick in London: it is too\r\n     expensive. I can do so in Syria, and where the sick are, there is\r\n     our Lord. I would do anything I could for India, but I feel sure my\r\n     advent there would not be allowed.\r\n\r\nThe time was presently to come when Gordon's wish was in a way he knew\r\nnot to be granted, and his death was to be an inspiration unto many. For\r\nthe present, Miss Nightingale hoped for the Cape or some other Colonial\r\nduty rather than Syria; and Sir Harry Verney wrote to Mr. Gladstone on\r\nthe matter, mentioning her name. This she had not intended. Never\r\nreluctant to intervene in cases which might be considered within her\r\ncompetence, she had the strongest objection to weakening her influence\r\nby any appearance of meddling in matters wherein she had no better right\r\nto express an opinion than anybody else. She scolded Sir Harry severely\r\nfor his indiscretion; but Mr. Gladstone sent a friendly answer (April\r\n26): \"he will make the circumstances known to Lord Kimberley who, he is\r\nsure, will, like himself, desire to turn Colonel Gordon's services to\r\naccount.\" Gordon, meanwhile, whose rapid changes of intention must at\r\nthis time have been puzzling to his friends, had accepted a military\r\nappointment at Mauritius, which, however, was soon followed by one at\r\nthe Cape. Before leaving England, he again sent Miss Nightingale some\r\nof his little books.[198] She never saw or heard directly from him\r\nagain; but from Brussels, on the day before his fateful interview with\r\nthe British Cabinet in London, he wrote to Sir Harry Verney (Jan. 17,\r\n1884): \"I daily come and see you in spirit--you and Miss Nightingale.\"\r\nAnd from Khartoum (Feb. 26): \"I am among the ruins of a Government, and\r\nit is not cheerful work. However, many pray for me, and if it is God's\r\nwill, I shall hope to get all things quieted down ere long. There is not\r\nmuch human hope in my wish, but I force myself to trust Him. Indeed one\r\nought to be content with His help, and in fact can lean on no other, for\r\nI have none. Unless He will turn the hearts of men towards peace, I have\r\nno hope. I wish I could have called and seen you and Miss Nightingale,\r\nbut I had no time.\" After his death, she took for some years a lively\r\ninterest in the management of the Gordon Boys' Home. It was at a meeting\r\nin connection with it that her words, quoted at the head of this\r\nchapter, were read.[199]\r\n\r\n  [198] Namely, _Short Notes_ (Bible readings), and thoughts on the Holy\r\n        Communion entitled _Thou shalt not eat, Take eat_. Miss\r\n        Nightingale's presentation copies of Gordon's privately printed\r\n        booklets included also his _Remarks on Expenditure in India_\r\n        (1881).\r\n\r\n  [199] Letter read at a meeting held at Aldershot in support of the\r\n        Gordon Boys' Home, August 30, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1881 and 1882 Miss Nightingale was very busy with\r\nIndian questions, and when Lord Ripon's policy was disclosed, he became\r\na hero to her almost comparable to General Gordon. In forwarding to Lord\r\nRipon a copy of one of her Indian pieces, she sent her \"deepest\r\nreverence and highest hopes for all the great measures by which the\r\nViceroy is bringing peace to the people of India and fulfilling\r\nEngland's pledges. And the love and blessing of India's people be upon\r\nhim!\" Readers of the present generation, who do not remember the\r\npolitical controversies of thirty years ago, and who are familiar with\r\nexperiments in Indian reform, more daring in some respects than any\r\nwhich Lord Ripon attempted, may wonder at Miss Nightingale's enthusiasm.\r\nBut it was very natural to one holding her views at the time. The\r\nadmiration which she felt for Lord Ripon and his policy was equalled by\r\nthe passionate detestation felt by the larger, if not the better, part\r\nof Anglo-Indian opinion. The opposition to the \"Ilbert Bill,\" named\r\nafter the member of the Legislative Council who introduced it, was\r\nintensely bitter; that to some other branches of Lord Ripon's policy,\r\nhardly less so. Miss Nightingale was behind the scenes both at Calcutta\r\nor Simla and in London: in India by confidential communications from\r\nLord Ripon himself, in London through friends in the India Office. She\r\nknew how uncertain was the support he received in his own Council, and\r\nhow strong was the opposition in the Council in Downing Street. He was a\r\ngood man fighting against adversity, and she was eager to do what she\r\ncould to help him. His reforms were also hers. She had spent years of\r\nlabour in mastering the intricacies of land tenure in India. For years\r\nher heart had been full of the grievances of the cultivators. And now\r\nLord Ripon had prepared Land Reform Bills for Bengal and Oudh which, if\r\npassed, would give the ryot security against oppression. She had thought\r\nmuch and written something on Indian education.[200] It was \"not\r\nenough,\" she had said, \"to read Locke and Mill.\" She wanted an education\r\nwhich would teach the peoples of India to be \"men,\" which would\r\nencourage them to the better cultivation of agriculture and industries,\r\nwhich would enable every _patel_ (village headman) to understand and\r\nenforce the principles of sanitation. And Lord Ripon had appointed an\r\nEducation Commission (1882), from which some useful reforms followed. As\r\nfor the \"Ilbert Bill,\" which sought to confer upon duly qualified native\r\njudges powers equal to their position, it was in Miss Nightingale's eyes\r\na measure of simple justice and duty; it was an honest fulfilment,\r\nwithin its scope, of the Proclamation of 1858, in which the Queen\r\ndeclared her pleasure, that as far as may be \"Our subjects of whatever\r\nrace or creed be impartially admitted to Our service, the duties of\r\nwhich they may be qualified by their education, ability, and integrity\r\nduly to discharge.\" Lord Ripon's measures in the direction of local\r\nself-government similarly appealed to Miss Nightingale. It has been\r\nthought by some that Lord Ripon attempted too much and allowed too\r\nlittle for Lord Salisbury's \"periods of Indian cosmogony.\" But in these\r\nmatters some one must begin; and if some of the hopes raised by Lord\r\nRipon's pronouncements have been doomed to disappointment, the fears of\r\nhis more frantic opponents have been in at least equal measure belied by\r\nthe event. Miss Nightingale was among those with whom hope ran highest.\r\nHer fundamental doctrine of human perfectibility by Divine order\r\nencouraged her to see in Lord Ripon the Providential instrument of vast\r\nchanges. She approved whole-heartedly of all that he actually proposed,\r\nwriting him letters of enthusiastic encouragement, and she also plied\r\nhim with suggestions of further reforms. In particular, she sent him a\r\nscheme--in which Captain Galton, Dr. Sutherland, and Sir Richard Temple\r\ncollaborated with her--for village sanitation in India. She regarded his\r\nViceroyalty almost as the beginning of the millennium.\r\n\r\n  [200] See Bibliography A, No. 100.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, however, was no idle or vague enthusiast. She was one\r\nof those who, while they fix their eyes on the stars, keep their feet\r\nfirmly planted on the ground. She was as indefatigable as ever in\r\nmastering every detail, a process in which Lord Ripon's supply of\r\nMinutes and other documents provided abundant material, and she\r\ncontinued to see and correspond with every available Anglo-Indian or\r\nIndian who could help her, or whom she could hope to influence. There\r\nwere two main lines on which her activities moved. \"India says,\" she\r\nwrote, \"'We want all the help you can give us from home.'\" So, then, she\r\ndevoted herself, in the first place, to the support of Lord Ripon's\r\npolicy. She was constant in inspiring sympathisers at home to fresh\r\nexertions. She suggested meetings and propaganda. She wrote articles and\r\nassisted others to write. She was in constant communication with Sir\r\nWilliam Wedderburn. She made the acquaintance of Mr. A. O. Hume, \"the\r\nfather of the Indian National Congress.\" She saw Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji,\r\nMr. Lalmohun Ghose, and other Indian gentlemen. But Miss Nightingale had\r\nno fanatical belief in the value of legislative reforms in themselves.\r\nThey are worth no more than the public opinion and the individual\r\neffort which they express or inspire. If Lord Ripon's policy was indeed\r\nto inaugurate a millennium in India, there must be a new zeal alike in\r\nAnglo-Indian administration and among the more educated classes of\r\nIndia. In her interviews with the latter, she was constant in impressing\r\nupon them how much each one might do in promoting sanitation and\r\neducation. She took a lively interest in the Zenana mission. She saw\r\nMrs. Scharlieb when that lady went out to practise medicine in India,\r\ncorresponded with her, and gave her introductions. Lord Roberts came to\r\nsee her (June 1881) before taking up his appointment as\r\nCommander-in-Chief in Madras. Mr. Ilbert had seen her before going out\r\nas judicial member of the Governor-General's Council, and they kept up a\r\ncorrespondence. Sir Mountstuart Grant Duff similarly called on his\r\nappointment to the Governorship of Madras (June 1881), and throughout\r\nhis term of office he wrote reporting progress on all matters likely to\r\ninterest her.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was particularly interested in agricultural development\r\nand education. She saw much of Sir James Caird, and corresponded with\r\nMr. W. R. Robertson, the Principal of the Agricultural College in\r\nMadras. Candidates selected for the Indian Civil Service were now given\r\nthe option of a year's study at the University before going out, and at\r\nBalliol Mr. Arnold Toynbee was appointed a lecturer to them. Miss\r\nNightingale made his acquaintance, and corresponded with him. \"I know\r\nnothing,\" she wrote (May 30, 1882), \"that tells so soon, so widely, so\r\nvigorously as Indian Civil Service administration. Balliol sends forth\r\nher raw missionaries; and in four years from the time he was an\r\nundergraduate, see what a man may do!\" \"Could not some instruction be\r\ngiven,\" she suggested (Oct. 20, 1882), \"in agriculture and forestry,\" so\r\nas \"at least to direct your students' attention to what are the peculiar\r\nwants of India, a knowledge often absent in her rulers? In agricultural\r\nchemistry, in botany (as regards plants and woods), in geology (as\r\nregards soils and water-supply), in forestry (as regards rainfall and\r\nfuel), in animal physiology (as regards breeds, fodder, and\r\ncattle-diseases), there is much ignorance in India. What if Scientific\r\nAgriculture could be taught at Oxford?\" These things have of late years\r\nbeen done both at Oxford and at Cambridge. Then Miss Nightingale\r\ndiscussed with Mr. Toynbee the importance of familiarizing the students\r\nwith the agrarian conditions in India, \"so as to open the minds of these\r\nfuture administrators and judges to the real significance of their\r\nposition and its responsibilities.\" To this end she induced her friend,\r\nSir George Campbell, to give a course of lectures at Oxford. Of her own\r\nwritings during this period[201] the most considerable was an elaborate\r\nexposition and defence of Lord Ripon's Bengal Land Tenure Bill, of\r\nwhich, as of his other measures, the fate was hanging in the balance.\r\nThis Paper--entitled in her fanciful way _The Dumb shall speak, and the\r\nDeaf shall hear, or, The Ryot, the Zemindar, and the Government_--was\r\nread (by Mr. Frederick Verney) at a meeting of the East India\r\nAssociation at Exeter Hall on June 1, 1883, with Sir Bartle Frere in the\r\nchair. It was well reported; there was a full attendance of\r\ndistinguished Anglo-Indians, and a lively discussion followed. Miss\r\nNightingale printed her Paper as a pamphlet and distributed it widely.\r\nThe discussion showed much difference of opinion, but every speaker paid\r\na tribute to Miss Nightingale's knowledge and devotion. There was one\r\nwho was able from personal experience to recall the thoughts of the\r\naudience to other scenes wherein she had won her first renown. This was\r\nSurgeon-Major Vincent Ambler. \"I was sick in hospital at Balaclava,\" he\r\nsaid, \"and she nursed me through a long illness of Crimean fever. She\r\nwas with me, I might almost say, night and day, and it is to her good\r\nnursing and energetic attention I owe my recovery. Previous to my\r\nillness I had had experience of her friendship when at Scutari, where\r\nthe hospitals were crammed with dead and dying, and cholera was carrying\r\noff hundreds of victims a day; it was amid such scenes as this that I\r\nconstantly beheld Miss Nightingale.\" Scenes not quite so terrible, but\r\nyet not entirely different, had been witnessed at this time in other\r\nfields of war; and Miss Nightingale, though no longer able to be in the\r\nmidst of them herself, played some part, nevertheless, in ministering to\r\nthe sick through her pupils, and in seeking to remedy defects in\r\nadministration which the test of war had once more revealed. To these\r\nscenes, leaving Lord Ripon's measures trembling in the balance, we must\r\nnow turn.\r\n\r\n  [201] For the particulars, see Bibliography A, Nos. 97-99, 109-111.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian campaign of 1882 called for female nurses, and Miss\r\nNightingale worked at high pressure in selecting them, and arranging\r\ndetails of their outfit. \"I have been working some days,\" she told\r\nMrs. Hawthorn (Aug. 3, 1882), \"from 4.30 A.M. till 10 P.M.\" Mrs. Deeble,\r\nof Netley, was in command of the female nursing corps, twenty-four\r\nstrong, in which several old pupils of the Nightingale School at St.\r\nThomas's were enrolled. They wrote repeatedly to their \"Chief\" at home,\r\nand she sent them constant messages of advice and encouragement. \"A\r\nthousand thanks for your dear kind letter, which seems to have given me\r\nfresh vigour to combat against our many difficulties.\" \"How good and\r\nkind you are to send me that welcome telegram. A few words now and then\r\nfrom you are so cheering.\" There are hundreds of such notes. The spirit\r\nof an old campaigner revived in Miss Nightingale as she read of stirring\r\ndeeds, whether earlier in South Africa or now in Egypt. Nor had her\r\n\"children\" in the army altogether forgotten their old friend. There were\r\nfour men, wounded at Majuba, who were detained for some weeks in\r\nhospital at Netley. They spent their time of convalescence in making a\r\npatchwork quilt, and asked that it should be sent from them \"to Florence\r\nNightingale.\" In November 1882 the Guards began to return from Egypt. A\r\nregiment of them (Grenadiers) was under the command of Colonel Philip\r\nSmith, a nephew of Sir Harry Verney, who persuaded Miss Nightingale to\r\ndrive to the station to see their arrival. She was deeply moved:--\r\n\r\n     _November_ 13 [1882]. For the first time for 25 years I went out to\r\n     see a sight--to Victoria Station to see the return of the Foot\r\n     Guards. Anybody might have been proud of these men's\r\n     appearance--like shabby skeletons, or at least half their former\r\n     size--in worn but well-cleaned campaigning uniform; not spruce or\r\n     showy, but alert, silent, steady. And not a man of them all, I am\r\n     sure, but thought he had nothing in what he had done to be proud\r\n     of; tho' _we_ might well be proud of _them_. Royalty was there with\r\n     its usual noble simplicity to bid them an unobtrusive welcome. The\r\n     men, not the Royalty, were to be all in all on that occasion. A\r\n     more deeply felt and less showy scene could not have been imagined.\r\n\r\nSo Miss Nightingale noted at the time, and presently she included her\r\ndescription in one of the letters which she sent every now and then at\r\nthe Commanding Officer's request for him to read out to the men of the\r\nVolunteer Corps at Romsey, near her old home. She used the incident\r\nagain in an address to the Nightingale Probationers (1883). A few days\r\nlater (Nov. 18, 1882) there was a Royal Review, on the Horse Guards\r\nParade, of the troops returned from the Egyptian campaign, and Miss\r\nNightingale was present, at Mr. Gladstone's invitation, on a stand\r\nerected in the Prime Minister's garden. She was seated between him and\r\nMrs. Gladstone, and Mrs. Gladstone, in recalling the occasion, used to\r\nsay that \"there were tears in Miss Nightingale's dear eyes as the poor\r\nragged fellows marched past.\" Her presence on this occasion was\r\nobserved, and she was invited accordingly to attend the opening of the\r\nnew Law Courts by the Queen (Dec. 4). She was given a place on the dais,\r\nand the Queen, noticing her, sent a message to say \"how pleased she was\r\nto see Miss Nightingale there, looking well.\"\r\n\r\nLord Wolseley's Egyptian campaign of 1882 was short and sharp, and from\r\nthe combative point of view admirably managed, but there was a good deal\r\nof sickness among the soldiers. The fighting during these years\r\n(1880-82), both in South Africa and in Egypt, put to the test the\r\nre-organizations of the Army Medical and Hospital Service which had taken\r\nplace since Miss Nightingale was \"in office\" with Sidney Herbert. The\r\nresult of the test was far from satisfactory. There were, indeed, no\r\nscandals on the scale of the Crimean War, and the death-rate during the\r\nEgyptian campaign may fairly be cited as proof that great improvements\r\nhad been effected since that time.[202] But there were grave defects,\r\nand Miss Nightingale played an active part both in bringing them to\r\nlight and in striving for their prevention in future. She was in close\r\ntouch with the hospital arrangements both in Natal and in Egypt through\r\nher friends among the lady nurses and lady visitors. From Natal, one of\r\nthe latter, Mrs. Hawthorn, had sent her many particulars, supported by\r\nevidence, of neglect in the hospitals. Miss Nightingale wrote a\r\nmemorandum on the subject, which she submitted, again through Sir Harry\r\nVerney, to the Secretary for War. Mr. Childers appointed a Court of\r\nInquiry (June 1882), presided over by Sir Evelyn Wood, to investigate\r\nthe charges. The Committee reported that \"improvements in the system of\r\nnursing are both practicable and desirable.\" \"This is rather a mild\r\nopinion,\" wrote Sir Robert Loyd Lindsay (Lord Wantage) to Miss\r\nNightingale (Oct. 23, 1882), \"considering that all the independent\r\nevidence went to show that the orderlies were often drunk and riotous,\r\nthat they ate the rations of the sick, and left the nursing of the\r\npatients to the convalescents.\" The Egyptian campaign followed, and many\r\ncases of neglect were alleged. The Committee was reconstituted (Oct.\r\n1882) on an enlarged basis, under the chairmanship of the Earl of\r\nMorley, with instructions to inquire, with special reference to the\r\nEgyptian campaign, into the organization of the Army Hospital Corps and\r\nthe whole question of hospital management and nursing in the field. Miss\r\nNightingale had a close ally during this inquiry in Lord Wantage, who\r\nwas a member of the Committee. She suggested witnesses to him; and sent\r\nhim elaborate briefs for their examination. She was furnished day by day\r\nwith the minutes of evidence; and when the time came for preparing the\r\nReport, she wrote successive papers of suggestions, which Lord Wantage\r\nsubmitted to the Chairman. \"I think,\" wrote Lord Wantage (May 5, 1883),\r\n\"that the Report, although dealing with details, and not going much\r\nbeyond them, will be of service. And I am bound to say many of the best\r\nsuggestions come from you, and for these I beg to thank you most\r\nsincerely\"; and, again, in sending her an early proof of the Report\r\n(June 12): \"I can only repeat once more how valuable your aid was to me\r\nduring the enquiry. If the Secretary of State carries out the Report,\r\nsome of the most useful improvements will have originated with you.\"\r\n\r\n  [202] The rate was 24.39 per 1000.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale found in the evidence a justification of her\r\nforebodings during past years. It disclosed evils comparable in kind,\r\nthough not in extent, to those at Scutari and in the Crimea.[203]\r\nSupplies procurable had not been procured. Hospital equipment was\r\nincomplete. The cooking was defective, and so forth. These defects were\r\ndue, Miss Nightingale considered, to the undoing of Sidney Herbert's\r\nwork. The Purveyor's Department, reorganized by him and her, had been\r\nabolished. For the rest, their whole scheme of reorganization had been\r\nbased on the regimental system, which had now been abandoned for a\r\nunitary system, though in time of war some return to the former was a\r\nnecessity. Miss Nightingale did not wholly condemn these changes in\r\nthemselves. What she complained of was that they had not been thought\r\nout in all the details or in terms of war. This was what she meant when\r\nshe noted the progress of reorganization during previous years, and\r\npronounced it lacking in administrative skill.[204] She now said that\r\nthe changes must be accepted, and threw herself into the work of lending\r\naid towards improvement. She saw and corresponded with the\r\nDirector-General of the Army Medical Department, Dr. T. Crawford, than\r\nwhom, she said, \"we have not had such a man of unflagging energy since\r\nAlexander.\"[205] She made friends with many other army doctors. Among\r\nthem was Surgeon-Major G. J. H. Evatt, who had seen service in India,\r\nand was now at the Royal Military Academy. He assisted Miss Nightingale\r\nin suggestions for the reorganization of the Army Hospital Corps in\r\nIndia, which she sent to Lord Ripon. She was consulted on revised\r\nregulations for various branches of the medical service. She was in\r\nconstant communication with her old associates, Captain Galton and Dr.\r\nSutherland, and she urged the former to keep the question of reform to\r\nthe front by writing in the papers and magazines.\r\n\r\n  [203] See especially the evidence of Lord Wolseley himself, summarized\r\n        at pp. 35-36 of the _Report of the Army Hospital Services Inquiry\r\n        Committee_, 1883.\r\n\r\n  [204] Her points may be followed in detail in the article referred to\r\n        below, p. 340, _n._\r\n\r\n  [205] Letter to Captain Galton, Nov. 28, 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nIn the middle of 1883 Miss Nightingale was in the thick of her two main\r\npreoccupations--the defence of Lord Ripon's Indian policy and the reform\r\nof the Army Hospital Service--when an opportunity came to her for\r\nputting in a word on behalf of each of these causes in the highest\r\nquarter. The decoration of the Royal Red Cross had been instituted by\r\nRoyal Warrant on April 23, 1883, and Miss Nightingale's attendance was\r\nrequested at Windsor on July 5 to receive the decoration for her\r\n\"special exertions in providing for the nursing of the sick and wounded\r\nsoldiers and sailors.\" She was invited to dine and sleep at the castle\r\non the occasion. The Queen, whose observant eye had noticed at the\r\nopening of the Law Courts that Miss Nightingale was attended by Sir\r\nHarry Verney, hoped that he would again accompany her. The state of her\r\nhealth compelled Miss Nightingale to decline the invitation[206]; with\r\nthe greater reluctance because there were two subjects--India and the\r\nArmy Medical Service--on which the Queen had permitted her to speak on a\r\nprevious occasion and on which she would now have highly prized the\r\nopportunity of speaking again. She begged to be permitted to write to\r\nHer Majesty instead. The permission was given, and Miss Nightingale sent\r\na letter upon the state of the Army Medical and Hospital Services. A\r\nsecond letter contained an expository vindication of Lord Ripon's Indian\r\nmeasures. In this connection it had been intimated to Miss Nightingale\r\nby a friend that she would do well to describe in a few words what the\r\nIlbert Bill really was. The Queen had doubtless read voluminous\r\ndispatches \"about it and about,\" and perhaps been addressed on the\r\nsubject by copious Ministers \"as if she were a public meeting,\" and like\r\nthe greater number of her subjects may have felt little the wiser. Miss\r\nNightingale condensed into the following words the nature of the Bill\r\nand the case for it: \"The so-called 'Ilbert Bill' is intended to give\r\nlimited powers to try Europeans, outside of the Presidency towns, to\r\nNative Magistrates and Judges who, after long trial of their judicial\r\nqualification, in corresponding positions, have shown themselves worthy\r\nto be entrusted with this duty and have risen to that grade where for\r\ntheir official responsibility such powers are required. It is no new\r\nexperiment, but has been tried on the Bench of the High Courts and in\r\nthe Chief Magistracies of the Presidency towns.\" Miss Nightingale then\r\nwent on to refer to the Queen's \"noble proclamation\" of 1858, and to\r\nconnect the Ilbert Bill with it. \"The Queen has proclaimed that she will\r\nadmit the natives of India to share in the government of that country\r\nwithout distinction of race and creed. She has invited them to educate\r\nthemselves to qualify for her service as Englishmen do. In face of the\r\ngreatest difficulties they have in competition with our ablest young men\r\ngained honourable place, and by trial in long service have proved\r\nthemselves efficient and trustworthy.\" It would be disastrous, Miss\r\nNightingale went on to argue, if, in deference to clamour, the Queen's\r\nGovernment were to draw back from giving effect to Her Majesty's\r\ngracious assurances:--\r\n\r\n     (_Sir Henry Ponsonby to Miss Nightingale._) OSBORNE, _August 13\r\n     [1883]_. The Queen hopes you will forgive her for not answering\r\n     your letters herself. Her Majesty has been so constantly\r\n     interrupted in writing that she has entrusted to me the duty of\r\n     conveying to you her thanks for the two very interesting\r\n     communications you have been good enough to address to Her Majesty.\r\n\r\n     With regard to the \"Ilbert Bill\" which is now being so vehemently\r\n     discussed, The Queen cannot but deplore the acrimony with which the\r\n     question has been treated; but as it is a matter under the\r\n     consideration of Her Majesty's Government, The Queen is unwilling\r\n     to express any opinion upon the measure at present.\r\n\r\n     It gave The Queen sincere pleasure to confer the decoration of the\r\n     Royal Red Cross upon you, who have worked so hard and who have\r\n     effected so much in the Sanitary Departments of the Army, and The\r\n     Queen is very grateful for your observations on the Military\r\n     Medical questions, and has read with much interest the paper in the\r\n     _Fortnightly Review_[207] to which you called her attention. Her\r\n     Majesty considers your remarks of the highest value, and fully\r\n     concurs in your opinion that the Hospital Services should be\r\n     carried out in a manner calculated to relieve the Medical officer\r\n     from the care of details not belonging to his Medical work. The\r\n     abolition of the Purveyor's Department and the change from the\r\n     Regimental to the General system--which The Queen much\r\n     regrets--were both effected on the recommendation of the Medical\r\n     officers, and The Queen observes that those who gave evidence\r\n     before the late Committee of Enquiry consider these steps to have\r\n     improved the efficiency of their Department. These matters have\r\n     been prominently brought to Her Majesty's notice lately, as the\r\n     selection of a new Commandant to Netley Hospital is now under\r\n     consideration, and the comparative advantages of naming a Combatant\r\n     or Medical officer are being discussed.\r\n\r\n     The Queen was extremely sorry to have missed the opportunity of\r\n     seeing you at Windsor, but trusts that on some future occasion she\r\n     may be more fortunate. I am to repeat to you Her Majesty's thanks\r\n     for your letters, and to assure you that The Queen will always be\r\n     glad to receive any communications from you.\r\n\r\n  [206] The decoration was accordingly sent to her by the Secretary of\r\n        State on July 17. It is now placed, in accordance with directions\r\n        in Miss Nightingale's Will, in the Museum of the United Service\r\n        Institution.\r\n\r\n  [207] \"The Army Hospital Service,\" by Captain Douglas Galton, in the\r\n        _Review_ of July 1, 1883.\r\n\r\nThe practical interest which Queen Victoria took in Army matters may\r\nhave been a factor in the prompt attempt to remedy the evils to which\r\nMiss Nightingale had called attention. In the following year Miss\r\nNightingale obtained, through Lord Wantage, a statement from the War\r\nOffice (Oct. 17, 1884) \"showing how far the recommendations of Lord\r\nMorley's Committee had been carried out.\" There were very few of the\r\nevils left unremedied--at any rate on paper.\r\n\r\nThere was one feature of the Hospital Service upon which the inquiries\r\nabove mentioned threw nothing but praise, and that was the female\r\nnursing. Lord Wolseley, whose service dated back, like Miss\r\nNightingale's, to the Crimean War, was particularly emphatic on this\r\npoint. \"I have always thought,\" he said, \"that the presence of lady\r\nnurses in our military hospitals was a matter of the first consequence.\r\nWhen, as a General, I have inspected hospitals, I always felt I could\r\nnot really 'get at' the patients; few men would dare to speak against\r\nthe orderlies of a hospital, no matter how you may question them, but\r\nthey would tell what they think very freely to a lady nurse who is\r\nattendant upon them. Apart from the incalculable boon which the care\r\nand kindness of such ladies confers upon the sick or wounded soldier, I\r\nregard their presence in all our hospitals as a most wholesome check\r\nupon the whole personnel in them. I am sure that the patients in a ward\r\nwhere there was a lady nurse would always receive the wine, food, etc.,\r\nordered them by the doctor, and the irregularities of the orderlies,\r\nsuch as those complained of by Mrs. Hawthorn, could not take place. I am\r\ntherefore of opinion that it was very wrong to have prevented that lady\r\nfrom entering the wards at Pietermaritzburg, and I think it would be\r\ndesirable to call attention in the Queen's Regulations to the great\r\nadvantage of procuring the aid of lady nurses at all stations, both in\r\npeace and war.\"[208] All this is precisely the doctrine preached by Miss\r\nNightingale when she said that the most important function of the female\r\nnurse was the education of the male orderly. Lord Wolseley, in the\r\nMemorandum just quoted, was speaking from personal experience in South\r\nAfrica. Subsequent experience in Egypt confirmed his opinions, and in\r\nhis evidence before the later Committee of Inquiry he was even more\r\nemphatic. \"The employment of lady nurses to a very large extent in every\r\nhospital on service\" was the surest way to efficiency. The female nurses\r\nat Cairo, Ismailia, and Alexandria were of the \"greatest assistance.\"\r\n\"It was delightful to go into a ward where there was a female nurse.\r\nTheir presence made the greatest difference.\" \"If I might so describe\r\nthem, although it is not perhaps a complimentary way of describing them,\r\nthey are the best spies in the hospital upon everybody.\"[209]\r\n\r\n  [208] Memorandum by the Adjutant-General printed at p. 1 of _Proceedings\r\n        of a Court of Inquiry into the Army Hospital Corps employed in\r\n        South Africa, War Office, June 1882_.\r\n\r\n  [209] See Questions 6166, 6214, 6215.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VII\r\n\r\nThe nurses were soon to have another opportunity of proving their\r\nusefulness; but we must first return, with Miss Nightingale, to Lord\r\nRipon's Indian reforms, the fate of which was in the middle of 1883\r\nstill uncertain. \"Which way,\" she wrote to friends likely to know, \"do\r\nyou think the storm is going?\" She had urged the Viceroy \"not to yield\r\nto the storm which raged round him,\" and he had assured her that he had\r\nno inclination whatever to do so, though he would not be unwilling to\r\nadmit reasonable amendments to his proposals. The Viceroy's letters\r\nshowed Miss Nightingale that his policy would need all the support that\r\nthose in England who agreed with it could give. The storm-centre was the\r\nIlbert Bill, and Lord Ripon's letter had prepared Miss Nightingale for\r\ncoming events. \"Reasonable amendments\" were ultimately accepted, and the\r\n\"Ilbert Bill\" was passed (Jan. 1884). The compromise was that Europeans\r\ntried before native judges should have the right of claiming a jury.\r\n\"The so-called compromise is, in fact, a surrender,\" wrote one of Miss\r\nNightingale's Radical friends; but for her part she held that the\r\nViceroy had wisely yielded somewhat on a less important point, in order\r\nto improve the prospects of his more important measures. With these,\r\nfrom time to time, Lord Ripon reported satisfactory progress. After some\r\ndifficulties with the India Office, he was allowed to establish an\r\nAgricultural Department in Bengal. The prospects of the Land Tenure\r\nBills were favourable.[210] The local self-government Bills were passed.\r\nEducational reforms had been made. Then, presently, it was announced in\r\nLondon that Lord Ripon had resigned and would shortly return to England.\r\nMiss Nightingale was much perturbed, and accused her friend of\r\n\"deserting the Empire.\" Lord Ripon in reply sent her a long letter of\r\nexplanation, the gist of which was that he had exhausted his powers of\r\nusefulness in India, and that, by retiring now instead of serving his\r\nfull term, he would be more likely to obtain a sympathetic successor.\r\nThe successor was soon appointed, and early in November Lord Dufferin\r\ncame to see Miss Nightingale. \"My visit from Lord Dufferin,\" she wrote\r\nto Dr. Sutherland (Nov. 6), \"took place yesterday. We went over many\r\nthings--Sanitation, Land Tenure, Agriculture, Civil Service, etc. etc.\r\nAnd I am to send him a Note of each. But about sanitary things he says\r\nhe is perfectly ignorant, especially of Indian sanitary things. But he\r\nsays, 'Give me your instructions and I will obey them. I will study them\r\non my way out. Send me what you think. Supply the powder and I will fire\r\nthe shot.' Give me quickly what instructions you think I should send\r\nhim.\" This letter reached Dr. Sutherland on a Friday, and she had\r\ncommanded him to send in his notes \"before Monday.\" But, as ill luck had\r\nit, the Doctor was busy \"in working at the cholera bacillus with a\r\nbeautiful Vienna microscope purchased with this object.\" That would\r\noccupy him on Friday and Saturday, and Sunday was Sunday; so \"the\r\nViceroy must wait.\" The reader who remembers an earlier chapter will be\r\nable to imagine Miss Nightingale's wrath. Notes and telegrams, now\r\nwithering, now pleading, followed fast upon each other. \"I did not know\r\nthe bacillus was of more consequence than a Viceroy.\" \"If you did a\r\nlittle on Sunday, the Recording Angel would drop not a tear but a\r\nsmile.\" But Dr. Sutherland was not to be cajoled into abandoning either\r\nhis science or his Sabbatarianism; and on the former point he put in a\r\nvery good plea in mitigation of judgment. If Dr. Koch's cholera bacillus\r\nturned out well, the discovery would save many more lives than Lord\r\nDufferin, however carefully instructed, was likely to do. Miss\r\nNightingale did not believe in the bacillus but allowed herself to be\r\nappeased, especially as it turned out that Lord Dufferin was not leaving\r\nLondon till a day or two later than she had supposed. So, she and Dr.\r\nSutherland collaborated in indoctrinating their fifth Viceroy in the\r\ntruths of their Sanitary gospel. There is a formidable list in her hand\r\nof \"Papers for Lord Dufferin.\" As he was as good as his word, he must\r\nhave had a strenuous voyage. On starting he sent to her one of his\r\npretty little letters:--\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Dufferin to Miss Nightingale._) S.S. \"TASMANIA,\" _Nov._ 13\r\n     [1884]. MY DEAR MISS NIGHTINGALE--I duly received the papers you\r\n     were good enough to send me, and you may be quite sure of my\r\n     studying them with the attention they deserve. I well know how well\r\n     entitled you are to speak with authority in reference to Indian\r\n     questions, and I can well believe that you have thought out many\r\n     conclusions which it would be of the greatest benefit to me to\r\n     ponder over. I hope you will forgive me for adding that one of the\r\n     pleasantest \"sweets of office\" I have yet tasted has been the\r\n     privilege I acquired of coming to pay you that little visit.\r\n\r\n  [210] They were ultimately passed with some amendment by Lord Ripon's\r\n        successor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Miss Nightingale, in the hope of completing the new Viceroy's\r\neducation, had written an account of her interview to Lord Ripon, so\r\nthat when they met he might know on what points his successor most\r\nneeded indoctrinating. Lord Dufferin had not long been gone when an\r\nopportunity offered itself for another effort at evangelization. At the\r\nend of November Mr. Gladstone called upon Miss Nightingale. He had come\r\nwithout an appointment, and she was unable to see him; but assuming, for\r\nher purpose, that he had proposed to discuss Indian questions, she sent\r\nhim a written statement of her views on various matters, and asked leave\r\nto write again with more special reference to Lord Ripon's splendid\r\nrecord. Mr. Gladstone thanked her (Dec. 6) for the valuable letter; said\r\nthat the best use he could make of it would be to commend it to the\r\nattention of Lord Kimberley[211]; and added that he would be very glad\r\nto hear her views about Lord Ripon's administration. She had wanted to\r\ninterest Mr. Gladstone, and was disappointed that he had only passed her\r\nletter on to Lord Kimberley, who, she thought, meant the India Council,\r\na body not sympathetic to the Ripon policy. But, as she had been given\r\nthe opening, she made another attempt. Mr. Gladstone was, of course, in\r\ngeneral sympathy with Lord Ripon, but she wanted the Prime Minister to\r\ngive greater prominence and emphasis to Indian internal reforms in his\r\nspeeches. She did not succeed. \"I wish I could hope,\" wrote a friend who\r\nknew both India and Mr. Gladstone well (Jan. 4, 1885), \"that you could\r\nmake some real impression on him; but at his age and at this time, when\r\nhis hands are so full, what can you expect? He has never given his mind\r\nto India, and it is too late now.\" It was not only Mr. Gladstone who was\r\npreoccupied at this time with other things than the welfare of the\r\nIndian peoples. Miss Nightingale soon discovered this. Lord Ripon was\r\nnearly due in England. He ought, she said, to receive a popular welcome\r\nas enthusiastic as any accorded to a conquering General. As there were\r\nno signs of any preparation in that sort, she worked very hard, though\r\nwith very little success, to organize a welcome in the form of laudatory\r\narticles in various newspapers and reviews.[212] She herself wrote an\r\nenthusiastic appreciation, but she was unwilling to sign it. The editors\r\nwere willing to publish anything to which Miss Florence Nightingale\r\nwould give her name, but for articles in praise of Lord Ripon's policy\r\nwithout that attraction there was no demand. As soon as it was disclosed\r\nthat what was offered was only an unsigned article, or an article signed\r\nby some nominee of hers, the editors, with one consent, discovered that\r\nexigencies of space prevented its insertion. And this was not\r\nsurprising; for Khartoum had fallen, and the Government was tottering.\r\nMiss Nightingale was as keenly interested as any one else in those\r\nthings; but there were few beside herself to whom the standing problems\r\nof Indian administration were matters of \"life and death,\" no less\r\npassionately interesting than the fate of a hero or the fall of a\r\nministry.\r\n\r\n  [211] Who had been transferred from the Colonial to the India Office in\r\n        December 1882.\r\n\r\n  [212] The only success was with the _Pall Mall Gazette_, which published\r\n        a welcoming article (by Mr. F. Verney) on January 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VIII\r\n\r\nLord Wolseley had been appointed to command a Gordon Relief Expedition\r\nin August 1884. There were already female nurses in Egypt. Some had been\r\nretained at Cairo after the Arabi Campaign of 1882. Others had been sent\r\nto Suakin during the \"military operations\" of 1883. More were now sent\r\nby the Government, and some were ordered up the Nile to Wady Halfa. Miss\r\nNightingale felt this to be a great event. \"Luther says,\" she wrote to\r\nMiss Pringle (Claydon, Oct. 11, 1884), \"that he looks and sees the\r\nfirmament which God has made without pillars, and we wretched men are\r\nalways afraid that it will tumble down unless we make our little pillars\r\nhalf a foot high. It is 34 years since I was at Wady Halfa. How little I\r\ncould ever have thought that there would be trained nurses now there! O\r\nfaithless me, that think God cannot make His firmament without\r\npillars.\" But Miss Nightingale's religion enjoined, as we know, \"working\r\nwith God.\" The ultimate issue did not rest upon the little pillars; but\r\nthey must be set up for what they are worth none the less, and Miss\r\nNightingale threw herself, heart and soul, into forwarding the Egyptian\r\nnursing campaign. Presently more nurses were sent out on private\r\ninitiative--some by the National Aid Society, others by a committee of\r\nladies. On February 20, 1885, Lady Rosebery called at South Street. She\r\nand Mrs. Gladstone and Lady Salisbury, and other ladies, with the\r\nPrincess of Wales, were proposing to establish a Committee of their own\r\nto send additional comforts for the sick and wounded, as well as\r\nadditional nurses. In order to secure unity of administration, and in\r\nloyalty to Lord Wantage's Society, Miss Nightingale advised against any\r\nseparate organization, and the Committee, which she then agreed to join,\r\nwas reconstituted as \"The Princess of Wales's Branch of the National Aid\r\nSociety.\" The Superintendent of the nurses sent out by the Government\r\nwas one of Miss Nightingale's dearest pupils, Miss Rachel Williams,\r\nwhose acquaintance we have made already under her pet-name of \"The\r\nGoddess.\" She had been in indifferent health and much worried. She\r\nstayed in South Street while arrangements were pending, and Miss\r\nNightingale announced the departure to Miss Pringle (March 4): \"Our\r\ndarling has started this morning by the _Navarino_ with seven nurses for\r\nSuez. If you had seen, as I did, how, the moment it was settled that she\r\nwas to have this work, the cloud and the load were lifted off her, and\r\nshe became again the Goddess and her youth returned, you would have\r\nfelt, as she said, that Providential Goodness had opened and guided\r\nevery step of her way. As soon as her appointment was made she looked as\r\nbeautiful and bonny as ever.\"\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of Miss Nightingale's decision, her memory for matters of\r\ndetail, her thoughtfulness for others even in trivial things, her\r\nkindliness of heart interlacing the practical instinct, the mingled\r\nplayfulness and gravity of her manner--these things are all illustrated\r\nin the reminiscences of another member of the party which sailed for\r\nEgypt in the _Navarino_:--\r\n\r\n     I was then Sister of one of the surgical wards at King's College\r\n     Hospital. It was on a Saturday in February, about midday, just as I\r\n     was due to attend the operation cases from my ward, that a\r\n     one-armed commissionaire appeared at the ward door: \"A note for\r\n     Sister Philippa from Miss Nightingale,\" he said. The request it\r\n     contained was characteristic of the writer--decisive, yet kindly.\r\n     Would I leave in three days' time for service in the Soudan? if so,\r\n     I must be at her house for instructions on Monday at 8.30 A.M., at\r\n     Marlborough House to be interviewed by Queen Alexandra (then\r\n     Princess of Wales) at 11 A.M.; and immediately afterwards at\r\n     Messrs. Cappers, Gracechurch Street, to be fitted for my war\r\n     uniform. Would I also breakfast with her on Wednesday, so that she\r\n     \"might check the fit of my uniform, and wish me God-speed.\" Months\r\n     afterwards, when the war was over, and we were quietly chatting\r\n     over things at Claydon, how she enjoyed hearing the numerous\r\n     trivial details of that three days' rush! Again and again she would\r\n     refer to that afternoon when I had to stand by the patient's side\r\n     in the operating theatre, mechanically waiting on the surgeons,\r\n     outwardly placid, yet inwardly, as I told her, in a fever of\r\n     excitement, not so much at the thought of going to the front, as at\r\n     the fact I had been chosen by her to follow in her footsteps.\r\n\r\n     On the Monday above referred to, punctually at half-past eight, I\r\n     arrived at South Street, wondering what my reception would be, but\r\n     before ten minutes had passed all wonder and speculation had given\r\n     place to unbounded admiration and (even at that early\r\n     acquaintanceship) affection for the warm-hearted old lady who\r\n     counselled me as a nurse, mothered me as an out-put from her Home,\r\n     and urged me to spare no point--myself specially--where the\r\n     soldiers were concerned. \"Remember;\" she said, \"when you are far\r\n     away up-country, possibly the only English woman there, that those\r\n     men will note and remember your every action, not only as a nurse,\r\n     but as a woman; your life to them will be as the rings a pebble\r\n     makes when thrown into a pond--reaching far, reaching wide--each\r\n     ripple gone beyond your grasp, yet remembered almost to\r\n     exaggeration by those soldiers lying helpless in their sickness.\r\n     See that your every word and act is worthy of your profession and\r\n     your womanhood.\" Then she asked me to accept an india-rubber\r\n     travelling bath as \"her parting gift to a one-time probationer who\r\n     had once reminded her that cleanliness was next to Godliness,\"[213]\r\n     and in spite of the merry twinkle in her eye as she said this,\r\n     there were tears of anxious kindness as she added, \"God guard you\r\n     in His safe keeping and make you worthy of His trust--our\r\n     soldiers.\"\r\n\r\n     I saw nothing more of her till Wednesday morning. The troop-ship in\r\n     which we were to go out left Tilbury Docks at 11 o'clock, and I was\r\n     to breakfast with Miss Nightingale at half-past seven. It was\r\n     rather a rush to manage it, but it was well worth any amount of\r\n     inconvenience to have that last hour with her, and it was a picture\r\n     that will always remain above all others in my memory. Propped up\r\n     in bed, the pillows framing her kindly face with its lace-covered\r\n     silvery hair, and twinkling eyes. I often think her sense of humour\r\n     must have been as strong a bond between her and the soldiers as her\r\n     sympathy was. The coffee, toast, eggs, and honey, \"a real English\r\n     breakfast, dear child,\" she said, \"and it is good to know you will\r\n     have honestly earned the next one you eat in England.\" \"And suppose\r\n     I don't return to eat one at all?\" I asked. \"Well! you will have\r\n     earned that too, dear heart,\" she answered quietly. Who can be\r\n     surprised that we worshipped our Chief? Other nurses were going out\r\n     in the same ship as I, and when we entered our cabins we found a\r\n     bouquet of flowers for each of us, attached to which was \"God-speed\r\n     from Florence Nightingale.\"\r\n\r\n     Six months after, in the glare and heat of an August afternoon,\r\n     when the Egyptian campaign was a thing of the past, a shipload of\r\n     sick and wounded soldiers glided slowly into the docks at\r\n     Southampton. While I was helping to transfer some of the most\r\n     serious cases to Netley, a telegram was handed to me. It was from\r\n     Miss Nightingale: \"Am staying at Claydon, cleaners and painters in\r\n     possession of 10 South Street, but two rooms, Mrs. Neild [the\r\n     Housekeeper], and a warm welcome are awaiting your arrival there.\r\n     Use them as long as you wish.\" On arriving at South Street I found\r\n     it all just as she had said, and by the first post next day came a\r\n     letter from Claydon, _such_ a home welcome! It was well worth all\r\n     the heat and glare of a Soudan summer, all the absence of water,\r\n     and presence of insects, and the hundred and one other\r\n     uncomfortable things that flesh is heir to during similar\r\n     circumstances, to get such a letter of welcome as that. It ended up\r\n     with \"make South Street your headquarters till your work is\r\n     finished\" (there was much detail to complete in connection with the\r\n     National Aid Society before I could leave London), \"and then come\r\n     to me at Claydon.\" So after a couple of weeks' work in London, I\r\n     went to Claydon, and there, during a month's rest in one of the\r\n     most beautiful of England's country homes, I learned to know and\r\n     understand Miss Nightingale, to realize what the friendship of a\r\n     character like hers means. \"The essence of Friendship,\" says\r\n     Emerson, \"is tenderness and trust.\" No words better describe our\r\n     Chief than these.\r\n\r\n  [213] The writer--Sister Philippa Hicks (Mrs. Large)--was the \"cheeky\r\n        probationer\" above quoted, p. 252. Afterwards matron of the Great\r\n        Ormond Street Children's Hospital (1888); founder of the first\r\n        \"Co-operation for Nurses,\" at 8 New Cavendish Street (1892); gave\r\n        up nursing to be married (1898).\r\n\r\nSister Philippa was only one of the many war-nurses to whom their Chief\r\nshowed this tender friendship. During their service abroad, she was\r\nconstant in letters of encouragement and advice:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Miss Williams_, at SUEZ.) 10 SOUTH STREET, _July_ 3.... The\r\n     Orderlies are not hopeless but untrained. Government are now doing\r\n     all they can. In my day they _were_ hopeless. They place them now\r\n     under the Sisters. The great business of the Sisters _is_ to train\r\n     them. It is the more aggravating when there are so few Sisters that\r\n     they _can't_ give time to train these men who are essential in the\r\n     Field. O how I wish I could send you several Sisters at once! But I\r\n     am altogether puzzled. Your telegrams, which I suspect were not\r\n     dictated by you, say \"Sufficient.\" Would that I could help you to\r\n     nurse the Typhoids! I am sure you _are_ doing great good among the\r\n     Orderlies, even tho' you do not know it. The very fact that they\r\n     see you think neglect a crime does good. How well I know their\r\n     fatal neglects with Typhoid cases! But 30 years ago women Nurses\r\n     were just as bad. See the difference now. There is a Miss Williams.\r\n     Cheer up: fight the good fight of faith. I need not say this to my\r\n     dear, for she _is_ fighting it. God bless her! When I am gone, she\r\n     will see the fruit of her labours. Three cheers for her! A Dieu. To\r\n     God I commend you. Would I were His servant as you are. I wonder\r\n     whether you have had my letters. I have written by every mail.[214]\r\n\r\n     (_To the same._) 10 SOUTH STREET, _July_ 17 [1885]. Yesterday the\r\n     Guards Camel Corps and the Heavies marched into London, after\r\n     having been reviewed by the Queen at Osborne. Sir Harry went to see\r\n     them inspected by the Commander-in-Chief at Wellington Barracks. (I\r\n     would have given anything to have seen the Meeting with their\r\n     comrades if I had been well enough to go.) And he said it was the\r\n     most affecting thing he ever saw. These were the men who marched\r\n     across the Bayuda Desert--a handful of men taking tender care of\r\n     their handful of wounded, attacked by twelve times their\r\n     number--and reached the Nile below Khartoum; but when the steamer\r\n     reached Khartoum, Khartoum had fallen and Gordon was dead. There is\r\n     a picture of Gordon called \"The Last Watch,\" where he is watching\r\n     on the ramparts, the last night. It is very fine. He is unseen and\r\n     alone; there is the far-off look in his eyes of solemn happiness at\r\n     his reunion with God, so near, of deep grief for the poor black\r\n     populations whom he has to leave to their misery, and whom he has\r\n     failed to extricate; and yet of abiding, faithful trust in God that\r\n     He will do all things for the best. It was his constant\r\n     prayer--first for God's glory, then for these people's welfare, and\r\n     his own humiliation--that is, that he should feel the more, himself\r\n     being humbled, the indwelling God in himself. Have the little\r\n     _Lives of Gordon_ reached your men yet?[215]\r\n\r\n  [214] She had indeed, and more. I have counted the letters. There were\r\n        sixty-five to Miss Williams during her service in Egypt.\r\n\r\n  [215] Miss Nightingale had obtained leave to make a cheap reprint of Mr.\r\n        C. H. Allen's _Popular Life of General Gordon_ for free\r\n        distribution at her expense among the soldiers.\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale was living her Crimean life again in the life of\r\nher pupils. Many a little incident recalled the old days to her. One of\r\nthe nurses wrote that in her hospital the supply of soap had given out.\r\n\"Send to Cairo,\" Miss Nightingale answered, \"for any quantity you like,\r\nand I'll pay, but only if you can do it without embroiling yourself with\r\nthe authorities.\" Another of her pupils was nursing in the Citadel\r\nHospital at Cairo. \"I am on night duty now,\" she wrote, \"and I don't\r\ndislike it at all: in fact I enjoy trotting about this weird old place\r\nall by myself in the solemnity of the night! and now and then hearing a\r\nlow voice saying, 'Sister, would you mind doing so and so,' 'Sister, can\r\nyou give me something to ease my face,' etc., etc., and then feeding the\r\nhungry enteric patients at stated times who open their mouths in turn\r\nlike so many little birds!\" The picture drawn in this letter, and the\r\nzest which it showed, pleased Miss Nightingale greatly, and she passed\r\nit on to old pupils at home. They were thrilled. Lucky Sybil! they said;\r\nshe is doing work like the Chief's at Scutari! another Lady with the\r\nLamp amid the glimmering gloom! And Miss Nightingale, who received from\r\nthe medical authorities of the Army most satisfactory reports on the\r\nservices rendered by her nurses, rejoiced in their successes and\r\nusefulness. She would have smiled upon any pupil \"at the first stroke\r\nwhich passed what _she_ could do.\"\r\n\r\nYet with thankfulness that she had been able to show the way to others,\r\nthere was mingled something of the wistful regrets of old age. There was\r\nmuch in the administrative conduct of the nursing service at the front\r\nwhich she could have ordered better. There was a paragraph in a\r\nnewspaper about the attractions of \"afternoon tea in the nurses' tent\"\r\nwhich pained her (though the reference here was not, I think, to any of\r\nher own Nightingale nurses). Encouraging, cheery, helpful to others, she\r\nwas in herself sad and almost sombre. It was in vain that Mr. Jowett\r\nstill enjoined her to dwell upon all that she had been able to do, upon\r\nthe many blessings which had attended her work. \"You will have felt\r\nGeneral Gordon's death,\" he wrote (Feb. 22), \"as much as any one. What\r\npoor creatures most of us seem in comparison with him! But not you, not\r\nyou!\" But the note which she struck in her next Address to the\r\nProbationers was all of humility. Old friends and comrades were dying.\r\nIn 1882 a dear friend of her girlhood--Madame Mohl--died in Paris. In\r\nthe same year Dr. Farr died--one of the founders in this country of her\r\nfavourite science of statistics, and an associate of hers in work with\r\nSidney Herbert. One of the most valued of her allies in later Indian\r\nwork--Sir Bartle Frere--died in 1884. In the previous year a yet older\r\nfriend, and one of her wisest counsellors--Sir John McNeill--had died.\r\nHe had sent her a copy of the last piece he wrote; the preface to a new\r\nedition of Sir Alexander Tulloch's _Reply to the Chelsea Board_, in\r\nwhich Sir John in turn replied to the version of that affair given by\r\nMr. Kinglake.[216] Her letter to him, sent \"with the deepest affection\r\nand veneration,\" was in a sombre vein. The correspondence recalled old\r\ndays, but again \"How little permanent progress had been made!\" She only,\r\nshe began to feel, was left; and she so unworthy! What opportunities she\r\nhad been given! How little use she had been able to make of them! There\r\nwere \"dark nights of the soul\" when such self-reproaches were grievous.\r\nBut some years of life would perhaps still be granted to her. She would\r\nconsecrate them the more devotedly to higher service. \"To-day,\" she\r\nwrote (Christmas Day, 1885), \"let me dedicate this poor old crumbling\r\nwoman to Thee. Behold the handmaid of the Lord. I was Thy handmaid as a\r\ngirl. How have I back-slidden!\"\r\n\r\n  [216] See on this subject, Vol. I. p. 337.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n              \"THE NURSES' BATTLE\"; AND HEALTH IN THE VILLAGE\r\n\r\n                                (1885-1893)\r\n\r\n\r\n     Nursing cannot be formulated like engineering. It cannot be\r\n     numbered or registered like population.--FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE\r\n     (1890).\r\n\r\n     What can be done for the health of the home without the woman of\r\n     the home? In the West, as in the East, women are needed as Rural\r\n     Health Missioners.--FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE (1893).\r\n\r\nThe period of Miss Nightingale's life covered in this chapter includes\r\nthe year of Queen Victoria's Jubilee; which was also what Miss\r\nNightingale used to consider _her_ Jubilee Year. She fixed her effectual\r\ncall at February 7, 1837. In 1887 she had thus completed fifty years\r\nvowed to service. In August, a month of many memories to her, she looked\r\nback over the past and around her in the present, and was in a\r\ndespondent mood:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Mrs. S. Smith._) CLAYDON HOUSE, _Aug._ 5\r\n     [1887]. DEAREST AUNT MAI--Thinking of you always, grieved for your\r\n     suffering, hoping that you have still to enjoy. In this month 34\r\n     years ago you lodged me in Harley St. (Aug. 12). And in this month\r\n     31 years ago you returned me to England from Scutari (Aug. 7). And\r\n     in this month 30 years ago the first Royal Commission was finished\r\n     (Aug. 7). And since then, 30 years of work often cut to pieces but\r\n     never destroyed. God bless you! In this month 26 years ago, Sidney\r\n     Herbert died, after five years of work for us (Aug. 2). In this\r\n     month 24 years ago, the work of the second Royal Commission (India)\r\n     was finished. And in this month this year it seems all to have to\r\n     be done again. And in this month this year the work at St. Thomas's\r\n     Hospital seems all to have to be done again--changing\r\n     Matrons--after 27 years. And in this month this year my powers seem\r\n     all to have failed and old age set in. May the Father Almighty,\r\n     Irresistible--for Love is irresistible--whose work and none other's\r\n     this is, conduct it always, as He has done, while I have\r\n     misconducted it. May He do _in_ us what He would have us do. God\r\n     bless you, dearest Aunt Mai. As ever your old loving FLO.\r\n\r\nAnd in this month, too, Florence Nightingale was to die; but nearly a\r\nquarter of a century of life was first granted to her, and for the\r\ngreater part of the time she remained in full possession of her\r\nfaculties. Though she might be an \"old lady\" to young nurses, others\r\nremarked that she looked wonderfully fresh and youthful for her years.\r\nIf old age had set in, her powers had by no means failed, and in many\r\ndirections her work, though sometimes sore beset, continued to prosper.\r\nWe will take first in our survey her work in the nursing world.\r\n\r\nThe \"change of matrons\" at St. Thomas's Hospital, caused by the\r\nretirement of Mrs. Wardroper, was hardly such a tragedy as it seemed to\r\nMiss Nightingale. Mrs. Wardroper had done her work, and there were\r\nyounger women competent to fill the place. Mr. Jowett often begged Miss\r\nNightingale to remember that \"there is no necessary man--or woman\"--\"not\r\neven,\" as, greatly daring, he once added, \"yourself.\" But in this case\r\nthe Chief of the Nightingale School was not yet retiring, and she would\r\nstill be able to supervise it--perhaps even more closely under a new\r\nMatron. For many years Miss Nightingale continued to maintain the\r\nintimate touch with her School that has been described in an earlier\r\nchapter: seeing the Sisters constantly, making the personal acquaintance\r\nof nurses, conferring with their medical instructors, reading their\r\ndiaries and examination papers. Her heart was even more closely in the\r\nwork when she secured the appointment, as Mrs. Wardroper's successor, of\r\nher dear friend, Miss Pringle. Presently, however, there came what was a\r\nheavy blow to Miss Nightingale. Miss Pringle joined the Roman communion,\r\nand it was necessary that she should retire from the Matronship of St.\r\nThomas's. The months of unsettlement before the conversion was made were\r\nfull of grief to Miss Nightingale. Indeed her notes and meditations\r\nsuggest that the \"loss\" of her favourite pupil was one of the heaviest\r\ngriefs of her life; but she loved her friend too well for the sorrow to\r\nleave any abiding bitterness. Over and over again in her meditations she\r\nwrote down lines from Clough's _Qua Cursum Ventus_. Miss Pringle was\r\nsucceeded by Miss Gordon, an old pupil of the Nightingale School; she\r\nand Miss Nightingale speedily became the best of friends, and things\r\nwent on much as before in the School. All these changes, with the\r\ndelicate weighing of rival claims and sometimes with the worrying\r\nconflict of personal ambitions, caused Miss Nightingale heavy anxiety.\r\nIntensely conscientious, acutely sensitive, and seeing in every change a\r\ngreat potentiality of good or evil, she could not treat such things as\r\nmere matters of business. There have been Prime Ministers who could not\r\nsleep of nights under the sense of responsibility caused by\r\necclesiastical preferment; and to Miss Nightingale the selection of a\r\nSuperintendent or a Home Sister was even as the appointment of a bishop.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThe movement for District Nursing, which was always near to Miss\r\nNightingale's heart, and which, in conjunction with Mr. Rathbone and\r\nothers, she had done much to promote, received considerable extension by\r\nthe action of Queen Victoria in 1887. The bulk of the sum presented as\r\nthe \"Women's Jubilee Gift\" was devoted by the Queen to \"the nursing the\r\nsick poor in their own homes by means of trained nurses.\" She appointed\r\nthe Duke of Westminster, Sir Rutherford Alcock, and Sir James Paget to\r\nbe trustees of the Fund, and to advise upon its administration. Sir\r\nJames Paget consulted Miss Nightingale, who, in several conversations,\r\nimpressed upon him her view that the essential things were the training\r\nof nurses for the work, and the association of them in \"Homes.\" The\r\nlines of the \"Metropolitan District Nursing Association,\" which had for\r\nmany years been largely supported by nurses trained in the Nightingale\r\nSchool and by grants from the Nightingale Fund, were adopted as the\r\nbasis of the \"Jubilee Institute for Nurses,\" and the Association\r\npresently became affiliated to the Institute. In an introduction which\r\nshe contributed in 1890 to a book giving account of these matters,[217]\r\nMiss Nightingale struck a warning note. \"The tendency is now to make a\r\nformula of nursing; a sort of literary expression. Now, no living thing\r\ncan less lend itself to a formula than nursing. Nursing has to nurse\r\nliving bodies and spirits. It must be sympathetic. It cannot be tested\r\nby public examinations, though it may be tested by current supervision.\"\r\nThe Royal Jubilee Institute in some ways advanced Miss Nightingale's\r\ncause, but she had misgivings. \"_Vexilla regis prodeunt_; yes, but of\r\nwhich King?\" Was the oriflamme, which was now beginning to wave above\r\nthe nursing sisterhood, \"of heavenly fire, or of terrestrial tissue?\"\r\n\"We are becoming the fashion,\" Miss Nightingale was fond of saying; \"we\r\nmust be on our guard. Royalty is smiling on us; we must have a care.\"\r\nSuch misgivings were speedily to be justified.\r\n\r\n  [217] See Bibliography A, No. 120.\r\n\r\nThe nursing world was for some years rent in twain by a dispute about\r\nRoyal Charters and Registration. The controversy lasted for seven years\r\n(1886-93); Miss Nightingale was in the thick of it, and during the more\r\ncritical period of the dispute (1891, 1892) it was her main public\r\npreoccupation. In 1886 the Hospitals Association[218] appointed a\r\nCommittee to inquire into the possibility of establishing a General\r\nRegister of Nurses. The Committee violently disagreed; in 1887 the\r\nmajority retired, and the minority founded the British Nurses\r\nAssociation with a view to carrying forward a scheme of Registration. In\r\n1888 the Hospitals Association appointed a second committee which\r\nproceeded to collect opinions from the various Nurse Training Schools.\r\nThese Schools were for the most part opposed to the idea of a General\r\nRegister; but there was difference of opinion among leaders alike in the\r\nmedical profession and in the nursing world. \"I have a terror,\" wrote\r\nMiss Nightingale to Mr. Bonham Carter (April 20, 1889), \"lest the\r\nB.N.A.'s and the anti-B.N.A.'s should form two hostile camps, judging\r\none another by that test chiefly or alone. This would be disastrous.\r\nThe Unionists and the Home Rulers show us an example of what this is.\r\nThey are two hostile camps, dividing families. It is like a craze. The\r\ntest, _e.g._ even of a good doctor or of an acquaintance is, to which\r\ncamp does he belong? Even a doctor, canvassing for an appointment, is\r\nasked whether he is Home Ruler or Unionist. I can remember nothing so\r\ndistressing since the Reform Bill, which I remember very well, when the\r\ntwo sides would not meet each other at dinner.\" I do not know that\r\nfeeling between the pro-Registrationists and the anti-Registrationists\r\nwent to the length of war-to-the-knife-and-fork; but the \"Nurses'\r\nBattle\" (as it was called in the newspapers) was hot and prolonged. From\r\na fighting point of view, the two sides were fairly matched. On each\r\nside there were eminent doctors. The \"anti's\" had an advantage in that\r\nthey included the greater number of those who had the longest and\r\nclosest knowledge of nurse-training; but the \"pro's\" had a Princess at\r\ntheir head. The Princess Christian had accepted the presidency of the\r\nBritish Nurses Association; and when the time came for applying for a\r\nCharter, it was the Princess who petitioned the Queen. \"This makes it\r\nawkward for us,\" said Mr. Rathbone to Miss Nightingale; and undoubtedly\r\nit did. There were courtly personages even among Miss Nightingale's\r\ndevoted adherents who were inclined to trim; and there were other\r\npersons, who, having never perhaps thought out the questions, were\r\npredisposed to do as the Princess did. Let each man in the battle have\r\nsuch credit as is due for his personal loyalty. \"In any matter of\r\nnursing, Miss Nightingale is my Pope,\" wrote Mr. Rathbone, \"and I\r\nbelieve in her infallibility.\" \"Nothing can save us,\" he said to Miss\r\nNightingale herself, \"except your intervention.\" She was not slow to\r\ngive it. Suggestions were made by intimate friends--Sir Henry Acland and\r\nSir Harry Verney--that she should see the Princess Christian and\r\nendeavour to come to terms; and later on, in 1893, when the Empress\r\nFrederick visited Miss Nightingale, they renewed the suggestion. But the\r\nPrincess Christian had made no overtures; she was committed to the\r\nparticular scheme advocated by the Association of which she was\r\nPresident; and, to Miss Nightingale, opposition to that scheme was a\r\nmatter of vital principle. She threw herself into the fray with an\r\nequipment of argumentative resource derived from her unequalled\r\nexperience, and with a passionate conviction inspired by long brooding\r\nover a fixed ideal.\r\n\r\n  [218] An Association founded by Sir Henry Burdett, out of which came the\r\n        Nurses National Pension Scheme (a scheme which Miss Nightingale\r\n        much commended). She took a different view of his Directory of\r\n        Nurses.\r\n\r\nThe objects of the British Nurses Association were \"to unite all\r\nqualified British Nurses in membership of a recognized Profession\"; \"to\r\nprovide for their Registration on terms satisfactory to physicians and\r\nsurgeons as evidence of their having received systematic training\"; \"to\r\nassociate them for mutual help and protection and for the advantage in\r\nevery way of their professional work\"; and \"with a view to the\r\nattainment of these objects, to obtain a Royal Charter incorporating the\r\nAssociation and authorizing the formation of a Register.\"[219] It was\r\naround the second and the fourth of these objects that the principal\r\nbattle raged. The case of the Association was _prima facie_ a strong\r\none. A Register of Nurses, duly certified as competent, would, it was\r\nargued, be a protection against impostors. The certification was to be\r\nby a Board which would insist on a certain standard of professional\r\nproficiency. Three years' training in a hospital was suggested as the\r\npreliminary test. The case, on the other side, as developed by Miss\r\nNightingale and her allies, was that the apparent advantages of a\r\nRegister were deceptive. Who was to be protected? Not the hospitals:\r\nthey protected themselves, without any general register, by their own\r\nmethods. If any one was to be protected, it must be the public; but the\r\nRegister would rather mislead than protect them. The placing of a name\r\non a register would, at best, only certify that at a certain date the\r\nnurse had satisfied the required tests; but the date might be long ago,\r\nand the fact of registration would tell nothing of her subsequent\r\nconduct or competence. The registration of midwives stood on a different\r\nfooting from that of nurses; for in the former case, a certain definite\r\ntechnical skill is of the essence of the matter: in the case of nursing,\r\ncharacter is as much of its essence as any technical qualification. As\r\nfor the three years' training in a hospital, there were hospitals and\r\nhospitals, training-schools and training-schools; and who was to\r\nguarantee the guarantors? The General Register would not raise the\r\nprofession of nursing; it would do an injury to the better nurses by\r\nputting them on a level with the worse, and to the profession by\r\nstereotyping a minimum standard. The British Nurses Association had\r\npublished a preliminary \"register.\" Miss Nightingale analysed it, and\r\nfound that in the case of nurses \"trained\" at one hospital, the private\r\nRegister of that Hospital excluded nearly one-third of those entered on\r\nthe B.N.A.'s register; and that another Hospital's Register included, as\r\n\"duly certificated,\" only one-third of those entered on the B.N.A.'s\r\nregister as trained thereat. \"You cannot select the good from the\r\ninferior by any test or system of examination. But most of all, and\r\nfirst of all, must their moral qualifications be made to stand\r\npre-eminent in estimation. All this can only be secured by the current\r\nsupervision, tests, or examination which they receive in their\r\ntraining-school or hospital, not by any examination from a foreign body\r\nlike that proposed by the British Nurses Association. Indeed, those who\r\ncome best off in such would probably be the ready and forward, not the\r\nbest nurses.\"[220] The much vexed question of \"internal\" or \"external\"\r\nexamination was, it will be seen, involved in this dispute. But to Miss\r\nNightingale a larger and a more vital issue was at stake. It was a\r\nconflict between two ideals--or rather, as she would have said, between\r\na high ideal and a material expediency. Mr. Jowett, though he agreed in\r\nher view \"that nurses cannot be registered and examined any more than\r\nmothers,\" was distressed that she was so greatly perturbed over what\r\nseemed to him so small a matter. \"It is a comparative trifle,\" he wrote\r\n(May 26, 1892), \"among all the work which you have done, and you must\r\nnot be over-anxious.\" To Miss Nightingale it was not a trifle, but a\r\ntrial--a possible parting of the ways. It was diverting attention from\r\ntraining-homes to examination-tests; it was sacrificing a high calling\r\nto professional advancement. \"There comes a crisis,\" she wrote to Mr.\r\nJowett (May), \"in the lives of all social movements, rough-hew them as\r\nyou will, when the amateur and outward and certifying or\r\nregistering spirit comes in on the one side, and the mercantile or\r\nbuying-and-selling spirit on the other. This has come in the case of\r\nNursing in about 30 years; for Nursing was born about 30 years ago. The\r\npresent trial is not persecution but _fashion_; and this brings in all\r\nsorts of amateur alloy, and public life instead of the life of a\r\ncalling, and _registering_ instead of _training_. On the other hand, an\r\nextra mercantile spirit has come in--of forcing up wages, regardless of\r\nthe truism that Nursing has been raised from the sink it was, not more\r\nby training, than by making the Hospital, Workhouse Infirmary, or\r\nDistrict Home a place of moral and healthful safe-guards, inspiring a\r\nsense of duty and love of the calling.\" The true way of \"protecting the\r\npublic\" was \"to extend Homes for Private Nurses on sound lines, aided by\r\nthe Nurses' Training Schools and Hospitals\"; not, by means of a\r\nChartered Register, to encourage nurses \"to flock to the Institutions\r\nwhich gave the easiest certificate at the least trouble of training.\"\r\nMiss Nightingale could not, then, regard the dispute as a trifle. It\r\ncaused her days and nights of grievous anxiety. Her meditations are full\r\nof despondency and searchings of heart both bitter and self-reproachful.\r\nThe Princess Christian, with the best intentions, was giving her name to\r\nundermine Miss Nightingale's ideal. This could not justly be attributed\r\nin blame to the Princess; the fault must have been with her, Florence\r\nNightingale, who had misused her opportunities, and had failed to\r\nimpress her ideal on other minds. She was an unprofitable servant. But\r\nhere, as in all things, the sensitive reproaches of the night-watches\r\nleft no trace of themselves on the work of the day; or rather, they left\r\ntheir trace in greater activity and devotion.\r\n\r\n  [219] Proceedings of First General Meeting, February 24, 1888.\r\n\r\n  [220] Letter from Miss Nightingale to Mr. Rathbone, read to the Privy\r\n        Council: see p. 90 of the book cited below (p. 362 _n._).\r\n\r\nIt was in 1889 that the occasion came for resolute action. The British\r\nNurses Association announced their intention of applying for a Charter,\r\nand proceeded to enlist public support. Miss Nightingale set to work on\r\nthe other side. She made the acquaintance at this time of Miss Lückes,\r\nthen, as now (1913), the Matron of the London Hospital, who was strongly\r\nopposed to the idea of registration. The acquaintance speedily ripened\r\ninto friendship, and henceforth Miss Nightingale was looked to for\r\nsupport and sympathy by the Matron of the London, hardly less than by\r\nher of St. Thomas's. Other nurse-training schools came into line, and a\r\nmanifesto was issued announcing their intention to oppose any petition\r\nfor a Charter. There was desultory skirmishing for some time between the\r\nRegistrationists and anti-Registrationists. There was a lively polemic\r\nin the newspapers. There were as many fly-sheets and pamphlets as if it\r\nwere a theological dispute in a University.[221] In 1891 the British\r\nNurses Association applied to the Board of Trade to be registered as a\r\nPublic Company, without the addition of the word \"Limited\" to its name.\r\nThe Memorandum and proposed Articles of Association were duly filed, and\r\nthe foremost place was again given, among the declared objects, to a\r\nregister of trained nurses, and to power to determine from time to time\r\nthe test for registration. Miss Nightingale and her allies took up the\r\nchallenge. Through Sir Harry Verney she approached the President of the\r\nBoard of Trade (Sir Michael Hicks-Beach) with a statement of the case\r\nagainst the Association. A counter-petition was presented; and after\r\nfull consideration the Board refused the application. The first\r\nengagement had thus resulted in a victory for Miss Nightingale. In the\r\nsame year there was a Committee of the House of Lords to inquire into\r\nthe London Hospitals. Mr. Rathbone, coached by Miss Nightingale, gave\r\nevidence on the question of the registration of nurses, and the\r\nCommittee reported against it. A second victory! But the\r\nRegistrationists now brought up their most formidable reserves.\r\nPermission was obtained from the Sovereign to use the title \"Royal.\"\r\nThus strengthened by favour in the highest quarter, the Royal British\r\nNurses Association petitioned the Queen for a Royal Charter. The\r\npetition was referred in the usual course to a special Committee of the\r\nPrivy Council, and the two sides marshalled their forces. A campaign\r\nfund was raised by the anti-Registrationists. Miss Nightingale appealed\r\nprivately to the Lord President of the Council and wrote various\r\nletters, Memoranda, Statements. She enlisted support from the medical\r\nprofession. Her old pupils, now in charge of nurse-training schools\r\nthroughout the country, rallied round her. Two petitions, of special\r\nweight, were presented to the Privy Council against the Charter. One was\r\nfrom the Council of the Nightingale Fund, the body which had been the\r\npioneer in promoting the training of nurses. The other was the \"Petition\r\nof Executive Officers, Matrons, Lady Superintendents, and Principal\r\nAssistants of the London and Provincial Hospitals and Nurse Training\r\nSchools, and of Members of the Medical Profession and Ladies directly\r\nconnected with Nursing and the Training of Nurses.\" The list of\r\nsignatures, which occupies twenty-three folio pages, was headed by\r\n\"Florence Nightingale.\" In the preparation of these documents, Miss\r\nNightingale had a large share, though much of the work--especially in\r\nthe instruction of the lawyers, in consultations and so forth--was done\r\nby Mr. Bonham Carter.\r\n\r\n  [221] On Miss Nightingale's side two of the most effective pieces were:\r\n        _Is a General Register for Nurses Desirable?_ by Henry Bonham\r\n        Carter (Blades, 1888), and _What will Trained Nurses gain by\r\n        joining the British Nurses Association?_ by Eva Lückes\r\n        (Churchill, 1889).\r\n\r\nThe Committee of the Privy Council sat in November 1892 to hear the\r\ncase.[222] Of the first day's proceedings Miss Nightingale wrote an\r\naccount in which, as will be seen, she did not let the Registrationist\r\ndogs have the better of it, but which betrays at the same time serious\r\nanxiety about the result:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Sir Harry Verney._) 10 SOUTH STREET, _Nov._\r\n     22 [1892]. Yesterday was the first day of the Privy Council Trial.\r\n     We had to change our senior counsel at the last moment, because\r\n     Mr. Finlay was engaged on an Election Committee. And our previous\r\n     four days were, therefore, as you may suppose, very busy. We were\r\n     fortunate enough to have Sir Richard Webster. Sir Horace Davey\r\n     opened the Ball on behalf of Princess Christian. His speech was\r\n     dull, and contained only the commonplaces we have heard for a year\r\n     in favour of the Royal Charter. The Judges were: Lord Ripon (who\r\n     only stayed half the time), Lord Monson, and two Law Lords [Lord\r\n     Hannen and Lord Hobhouse]. They appeared to have been chosen as\r\n     knowing nothing of the matter and as not having been on the Lords\r\n     Committee on Hospitals. Our side, Sir Richard Webster, followed\r\n     with a masterly speech--masterly from being that of a shrewd man\r\n     of sense, without rhetoric, and from his splendid getting up of our\r\n     case at short notice. He put very strongly our contention that\r\n     character, _unregistrable_, rather than technical training, makes\r\n     the nurse, and other of our points. The Judges adjourned till\r\n     Monday in the middle of his speech where he was saying as we\r\n     do--What is the use of saying that a Nurse has had 3 years'\r\n     training at such a Hospital? how can you certify the Hospital? He\r\n     will resume this subject and others on Monday. The Judges asked all\r\n     the questions--_not_ to the point--that you can fancy men perfectly\r\n     ignorant of the subject to ask, and which we have answered over and\r\n     over again. Sir Richard Webster said to Bonham Carter at the end of\r\n     yesterday, \"The judges are dead against us.\" The Charter pledges\r\n     itself to admit on the Register only nurses of three years'\r\n     Hospital training--which the Judges pronounced could do no harm.\r\n     But it provides for itself what may put into its hands the whole\r\n     control of what constitutes training. Is it not wonderful these men\r\n     do not see this? Well, \"we are in God's hands, brother, not in\r\n     theirs\" (the Privy Council's). In all my strange life through which\r\n     God has guided me so faithfully (O that I had been as faithful to\r\n     Him as He to me!), this is the strangest episode of all--to see a\r\n     number of Doctors of the highest eminence giving their names to\r\n     what they know nothing at all about. Sir James Paget told me\r\n     himself that the names were asked for at a Court Ball,--following\r\n     each other like a flock of sheep; to see their Council of\r\n     Registration made up of _Sirs_, only one of whom knows anything\r\n     about nurse-training (Sir James Paget himself asked me, why can't\r\n     nurses lodge out as students do!!); to see these able, good, and\r\n     shrewd men ignoring that such a thing is sure to fall into a\r\n     clique. They have let Princess Christian fall into such an\r\n     one already. She is made a tool of by two or three people. \"Lift up\r\n     your heads, ye gates, and the King of Glory shall come in. Who is\r\n     the King of Glory? The Lord strong in battle.\" O God of Battles,\r\n     steel thy soldiers' hearts against happy-go-luckiness, against\r\n     courtiership, fashion, and mere money-making on the part of the\r\n     Nurses and their Societies! _P.S._ This trial will cost us £700 at\r\n     least.\r\n\r\n  [222] A verbatim report of the hearing (Nov. 21, 28) was published in\r\n        1893 entitled _The Battle of the Nurses_ (Scientific Press).\r\n\r\nThe Committee took time to consider their advice to Her Majesty. In May\r\n1893 the decision was announced. The Committee advised Her Majesty in\r\nCouncil to grant a Charter in accordance with a Draft revised by them.\r\nOn June 6 the Charter was granted.\r\n\r\nEach side claimed the victory. The _Nursing Record_ (June 15)--an organ\r\nof the Registrationists--claimed that they had won all, and even more\r\nthan all, that they asked, and declared proudly that henceforth \"members\r\nof the Royal Chartered Association will hold a higher position than any\r\nothers.\" The _Hospital_, on the other side, argued that all this was\r\nill-founded, but if the \"British Nurses\" wanted to be congratulated on\r\nnothing, \"we are willing to congratulate them\" (June 24). The fight\r\nbefore the Privy Council now became a fight in the press on the meaning\r\nof the verdict. The anti-Registrationists, headed by Miss Nightingale\r\nand the Duke of Westminster, put their interpretation in a quiet letter\r\nto the _Times_ (July 3), which the Royal British Nurses Association\r\nhotly denounced as \"untrue in fact and injurious in intention\" (July 6).\r\nThe fact was that the Lords of the Council had steered a middle course.\r\nThey granted the Charter; but in it for the words \"the maintenance of a\r\nlist or _register_ of nurses, showing as to each nurse registered,\"\r\netc., they substituted the words \"the maintenance of a list of persons\r\nwho may have applied to have their names entered therein as nurses,\"\r\netc. There was nothing in the Charter which gave any nurse the right to\r\ncall herself \"chartered\" or \"registered.\" What the promoters hoped we\r\nneed not discuss; what the opponents feared was a Charter in such terms\r\nas would give the Corporation an authoritative, and perhaps ultimately,\r\nan exclusive right to register nurses, and thereby would give it also\r\nindirect control over nurse-training. No such Charter was obtained; and\r\nin this sense the opposition of Miss Nightingale and her friends had\r\nprevailed. The controversy is not dead; but, so far, her view has\r\ncontinued to prevail,[223] and the official registration of nurses is\r\nstill a pious hope to its supporters, a heresy to its opponents. Miss\r\nNightingale greatly deplored the feud, but sought to bring good out of\r\nevil. \"Forty years hence,\" she wrote to Mr. Rathbone (Feb. 26, 1891),\r\n\"such a scheme might not be preposterous, _provided_ the intermediate\r\ntime be diligently and successfully employed in levelling up, that is,\r\nin making all nurses at least equal to the best trained nurses of this\r\nday, and in levelling up Training Schools in like manner.\" \"Great good\r\nmay be done,\" she wrote to Mr. Jowett (May 1892), \"by rousing our side\r\nto an increased earnestness about (1) providing Homes for Nurses while\r\nengaged in their work of nursing, and (2) full _private_ Hospital\r\nRegisters, tracing the careers of nurses trained by them.\" There were no\r\nyears in which Miss Nightingale herself gave more thought and trouble,\r\nthan in 1891-3, to personal care for the affairs of the Nightingale\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\n  [223] See the report of a deputation to the Prime Minister in the\r\n        _Times_, April 29, 1913.\r\n\r\nIn a Paper which Miss Nightingale was invited to contribute to a\r\nCongress on Women's Work, held at Chicago in 1893, she treated the whole\r\nsubject of nursing.[224] This paper embodies in a methodical form her\r\ncharacteristic views, and in it she takes occasion in several places to\r\ntouch obliquely upon the controversy described in preceding pages. \"A\r\nnew art, and a new science, has been created since and within the last\r\nforty years. And with it a new profession--so they say; we say,\r\n_calling_.\" She dwells on the conditions necessary to make a good\r\ntraining school for nurses. She dilates upon the dangers to which\r\nnursing is subject. These are \"Fashion on the one side, and a consequent\r\nwant of earnestness; mere money-getting on the other side; and a\r\nmechanical view of nursing.\" \"Can it be possible that a testimonial or\r\ncertificate of three years' so-called training or service from a\r\nhospital--_any_ hospital with a certain number of beds--can be accepted\r\nas sufficient to certify a nurse for a place in a public register? As\r\nwell might we not take a certificate from any garden of a certain number\r\nof acres, that plants are certified valuable if they have been three\r\nyears in the garden?\" Then there was \"imminent danger of stereotyping\r\ninstead of progressing. No system can endure that does not march.\r\nObjects of registration not capable of being gained by a public\r\nregister!\" The whole paper is written with a good deal of gusto. The\r\nvolume in which it appeared was dedicated to Princess Christian.\r\n\r\n  [224] Bibliography A, No. 131.\r\n\r\nIn the following year Miss Nightingale had some correspondence with the\r\nPrincess, who, as President of the Royal British Nurses Association, had\r\nmade a scheme for enrolling a \"War Nursing Reserve\" through the\r\nHospitals, and had written to consult Miss Nightingale about it. The\r\nHospital Sisters were according to this scheme to be placed \"in\r\nsubordination to the Army Sisters\"--nurses with the larger experience\r\nunder those with the smaller. This seemed to Miss Nightingale a mistake;\r\nand she noted other details in which the scheme appeared to her\r\ninadequately considered. She pointed these things out faithfully to the\r\nPrincess, but the correspondence on both sides was cordial. The letters\r\nfrom the Princess made Miss Nightingale exclaim, \"How gracefully Royalty\r\ncan do things!\" And on her part she desired to be conciliatory. \"We\r\nshould, I think, be earnestly anxious,\" she wrote, \"to do what we can\r\nfor Princess Christian as she holds out the flag of truce, in order to\r\nput an end as far as we can to all this bickering, which does such harm\r\nto the cause.\"\r\n\r\nThere were thoughts in Miss Nightingale's mind throughout this\r\ncontroversy still deeper than any which have yet been noticed. She had\r\nan esoteric conception of Nursing which made her regard the view of it\r\nas a registrable business in the light almost of sacrilege. \"A\r\nprofession, so they say; we say, _calling_.\" And not only a calling, but\r\na form through which religious satisfaction might be found. Her view\r\ncomes out in a letter which she wrote to Mr. Jowett in 1889 in the\r\ncourse of a discussion with him upon the necessity of external forms for\r\nthe religious life: \"You say that 'mystical or spiritual religion is not\r\nenough for most people without outward form.' And I may say I can never\r\nremember a time when it was not the question of my life. Not so much for\r\nmyself as for others. For myself the mystical or spiritual religion as\r\nlaid down by St. John's Gospel, however imperfectly I have lived up to\r\nit, was and is enough. But the two thoughts which God has given me all\r\nmy whole life have been--First, to infuse the mystical religion into the\r\nforms of others (always thinking they would show it forth much better\r\nthan I), especially among women, to make them the 'handmaids of the\r\nLord.' Secondly, to give them an organization for their activity in\r\nwhich they could be trained to be the 'handmaids of the Lord.' (Training\r\nfor women was then unknown, unwished for, and is the discovery of the\r\nlast thirty years. One could have taken up the school education of the\r\npoor, but one was specially called then to hospitals and nursing--both\r\nsanitation and nursing proper.) This was then the 'organization' which\r\nwe had to begin with, to attract respectable women and give religious\r\nwomen a 'form' for their activity.... When very many years ago I planned\r\na future, my one idea was not organizing a Hospital, but organizing a\r\nReligion.\" Now, \"handmaids of the Lord\" cannot be certified by external\r\nexaminers, nor can a religious service be guaranteed by registers.\r\n\r\nDoes this view of the matter seem a little transcendental? It was in\r\naccord, at any rate, with another of Miss Nightingale's fundamental\r\ndoctrines, which in its application to the controversy had a severely\r\npractical force. Nursing, she held, is a progressive art, in which to\r\nstand still is to go back. No note is more often struck in her Addresses\r\nto Nurses. She held, as may already have been gathered from the\r\nforegoing summary of her case, that the Registrationists, consciously or\r\nunconsciously, had lost hold of that essential truth about nursing. It\r\nwas right that precautions should be taken against impostors, and that\r\nthe fullest inquiries should be made. Miss Nightingale's objection was\r\nnot to the precautions, but to their misleading nature; not to the\r\ntests, but to their inadequacy. The only real and sufficient guarantee,\r\nin the case of an art in which the training, both technical and moral,\r\nis a continuous process, was, she held, that the public should be able\r\nto obtain a _recent_ recommendation of the nurse, who was to be passed\r\non from one doctor, hospital, or superintendent to another with\r\nsomething of the same elaborate record of work and character that she\r\nherself required in the case of Nightingale Probationers and Nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThe fate of Miss Nightingale's work in the cause of Public Health both\r\nin India and at home was chequered during these years, even as was that\r\nin the cause of trained nursing, but here again substantial advance was\r\nmade in several directions. There was once a Secretary of State who\r\nentered the India Office possessed by a strong and personal interest in\r\nsanitation. There was some excitement in the Office. There were one or\r\ntwo men around the Minister who heartily approved; there were more who\r\nshook their heads. The Minister must have been listening, they thought,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, to a certain lady's \"beautiful nonsense.\" He was\r\ntoo impressionable. He was anxious to do things, in spite of the claims\r\nof economy. He was too much in a hurry. They took him in hand in order\r\nto quiet him down. They thought to have succeeded in making him\r\nsatisfied to leave things as they were. The other side became conscious\r\nof a change. \"It is essential,\" wrote one of them to a certain lady,\r\n\"that you should see him at once.\" The lady, who was the hope of one\r\nside and the fear of the other, was Miss Nightingale. The Minister need\r\nnot be identified; for these things, though true also of a particular\r\ncase and time, are here given as a general allegory. For thirty years\r\nand more, through all changes and chances in the political world, Miss\r\nNightingale was a permanent force, importuning, indoctrinating,\r\ninspiring, in the interests of better sanitary administration.\r\n\r\nFor some time after the early months of 1885 the political situation was\r\nvery unsettled. The Government formed by Lord Salisbury after the defeat\r\nof Mr. Gladstone in June was only a \"Cabinet of Caretakers,\" and it was\r\nnot worth Miss Nightingale's while to approach any of them. Besides, she\r\ninstinctively recognized the Secretary of State for India as a hopeless\r\nsubject. She was right. Lord Randolph Churchill was all against Lord\r\nRipon, and all for economy. When Lord Salisbury's Government was in turn\r\noverthrown, after the general election in December, Miss Nightingale,\r\nthrough various channels, approached Mr. Gladstone, and begged him to\r\nsend Lord Ripon to the India Office. He returned polite but evasive\r\nanswers, and so controversial an appointment was obviously improbable.\r\nLord Ripon went to the Admiralty. The excitement of the first Home Rule\r\nBill followed; the Government was defeated; another general election was\r\nnecessary, and all was in confusion. Dr. Sutherland, anxious to retire\r\nfrom the public service (for he was now nearly 80), was pressing Miss\r\nNightingale to devise measures for safeguarding his department after he\r\nwas gone. She pressed him to stay on yet a while. \"During the political\r\nearthquakes of the last 8 months, still continuing, no permanent\r\ninterest can be expected,\" she wrote to him (July 20, 1886), \"in those\r\nwho are so little permanent. The subject excruciates me.\" Lord Ripon,\r\nwho came to see her ten days later, thought that the times were\r\nunpropitious generally for good causes--an opinion which defeated\r\nMinisters are apt to hold. \"There are waves in these matters,\" he said.\r\n\"The thing is to come in upon the crest of the waves. You would have\r\ndone nothing for the Army and Sanitation if it had not been for the\r\ncrash in the Crimea. Now, the wave is against India.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, however, did not allow herself to be tempted into\r\ninactivity by this wave-theory. For the moment, indeed, there was\r\nnothing to be done with Ministers at home; but she had not been\r\nneglectful of cultivating relations with Anglo-Indians and Indians in\r\npositions of influence. In 1885 she had added Sir Neville Chamberlain\r\nand Sir Peter Lumsden to her list of Anglo-Indian acquaintances. Lord\r\nReay had called upon her (March 1885) before leaving to take up the\r\ngovernorship of Bombay, and she corresponded with him frequently on\r\nsanitary subjects. In October, Lord Roberts came before going out to\r\nIndia as Commander-in-Chief. Miss Nightingale took great pains with this\r\ninterview, Dr. Sutherland having furnished her in advance with an\r\nadmirable synopsis of what might still be done to improve the health and\r\nwelfare of the troops. Lord Roberts's command was fruitful of some\r\nreforms in which Miss Nightingale had been a pioneer. He established a\r\nclub or institute in every British regiment and battery in India. He\r\nclosed canteens. He opened coffee-stalls. He established an Army\r\nTemperance Association.[225] No letter which Miss Nightingale received\r\nin her Jubilee Year can have pleased her more than one which the\r\nCommander-in-Chief in India sent her from Simla on August 6. In this\r\nletter Lord Roberts told her that the Government of India had sanctioned\r\nthe employment of female nurses in the Military Hospitals. A\r\ncommencement was to be made at the two large military centres of Umballa\r\nand Rawalpindi, and 18 nurses, with lady superintendents in each case,\r\nwere to be sent out from England at once. The selection of nurses was\r\nentrusted to Surgeon-General Arthur Payne, who in the following month\r\nhad several interviews with Miss Nightingale. Thus, after twenty-two\r\nyears, was the scheme which she had put before Sir John Lawrence brought\r\nto fruition. Miss Nightingale saw the Superintendents before they went\r\nout, and letters from them were now added to the pile of those which she\r\nreceived from hospitals throughout the world, reporting progress or\r\nasking advice. Miss C. G. Loch wrote from Rawalpindi (April 12, 1888)\r\ndescribing how she had found that, as Miss Nightingale always said, the\r\neducation of the Orderlies was the most important thing for the nurses\r\nto do.\r\n\r\n  [225] See his _Forty-one Years in India_, chap. lxvi.\r\n\r\nThe official introduction of female nursing into the Indian military\r\nhospitals was by no means the only satisfaction which Miss Nightingale\r\nreceived during Lord Dufferin's Viceroyalty. He had declared himself\r\nignorant of Indian sanitary things, but had promised to learn; and not\r\nonly was he as good as his word, but Lady Dufferin was keenly interested\r\nalso. She founded the \"National Association for Supplying Medical Aid to\r\nthe Women of India.\" Miss Nightingale had long been interested in the\r\nsubject, and Lady Dufferin consulted her at every stage. One of the\r\nfirst things needful, Lady Dufferin had written (Sept. 19, 1885), was a\r\nsupply of Sanitary Tracts. \"In using the word tract, I am thinking of\r\nsome little books in Hindustani written by A.L.O.E. which I am obliged\r\nto read as part of my studies in the language. They are stories with a\r\nmoral, and I don't see why something of the kind might not be published\r\nwith health as a moral.\" Miss Nightingale took great pains in collecting\r\nsuitable raw material, and during the remainder of Lord Dufferin's\r\nViceroyalty wrote to her by almost every mail.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nYet more was to be \"fired,\" during Lord Dufferin's Viceroyalty, of\r\nsanitary \"shot\" supplied, as he had requested, by Miss Nightingale; but\r\nwe must now turn back to London, where, partly from circumstances and\r\npartly of necessity, Miss Nightingale was presently engaged in a\r\nvigorous campaign. There is a large bundle of correspondence during\r\nthese years upon a matter which is referred to in some of the letters as\r\n\"The Sutherland Succession.\" Now, Dr. Sutherland was in Miss\r\nNightingale's eyes the indispensable man. Not any longer in the personal\r\nsense, as described in an earlier chapter; for he was now a very old\r\nman, and was only able to help her on rare occasions. She had already\r\nfound a successor in this personal sense, or rather she had put Dr.\r\nSutherland's place into commission. Sir William Wedderburn was during\r\nthese later years her most constant collaborator in Indian matters, and\r\nfor the rest she relied upon Sir Douglas Galton.[226] She had often\r\nchafed at Dr. Sutherland's delays, but I expect that when Sir Douglas\r\nsucceeded to him she may in one respect have parodied to herself the\r\nwell-known Cambridge epigram, and said, \"Poor Dr. Sutherland! we never\r\nfelt his loss before.\" For Sir Douglas Galton, though devoted also to\r\nMiss Nightingale's service, was an exceedingly busy and much-travelling\r\nman, and she had to be content with the crumbs of his time. \"As it was\r\nsome time in the dark ages,\" she wrote (May 13, 1887), \"since I saw you\r\nlast--my memory impaired by years cannot fix the date within a decade--I\r\nseize the first day you kindly offer.\" And again (Dec. 3, 1889): \"I must\r\ntake your leavings, as beggars must not be choosers. Yes, please, your\r\ndog will see you to-morrow on your way from Euston for as long as you\r\ncan stop.\" Miss Nightingale relied greatly on Sir Douglas Galton's\r\nadvice; she had a very high opinion, not only of his thorough knowledge\r\nof all sanitary subjects, but of his sound judgment generally. From the\r\npersonal point of view, then, Dr. Sutherland was gone already; but in\r\nhis official capacity he was still indispensable. He was the mainspring\r\nof the system of sanitary administration, both for the home Army and for\r\nIndia, which Miss Nightingale had built up. He was the one paid working\r\nmember, and he was also the working brain, of the Army Sanitary\r\nCommittee, and it was to that Committee that Indian sanitary reports\r\nwere referred. But he was impatient to retire. At any moment his health\r\nmight become worse, and he might send in his resignation before\r\narrangements had been made for the appointment of a successor. So long\r\nas he remained at his post, no changes were likely to be made; but if he\r\nretired, it was very probable that no successor would be appointed, and\r\nthat the whole system would collapse. That the heads of the Army were\r\nignorant of Dr. Sutherland's services, had been burnt in upon Miss\r\nNightingale's mind a few years before. In discussing some matter of army\r\nnursing with the minister of the day, she had suggested the reference of\r\nit to Dr. Sutherland. \"Who is he?\" said the minister; \"I have never\r\nheard of him.\" At the India Office it was much the same. \"I don't\r\nthink,\" wrote a friend (Sept. 8, 1886), \"that this office in general\r\nappreciates the importance of those reviews of Indian sanitary matters\r\nof which Dr. Sutherland has been the real author hitherto.\" The whole\r\nsystem would lapse, he feared, unless she was able to do something.\r\n\r\n  [226] Captain Galton was knighted in 1887.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. The sanitary service in India itself was in danger.\r\nThe annexation of Burma had made retrenchment necessary; a Finance\r\nCommittee was at work in recommending economies; and Miss Nightingale\r\nreceived private information that the Sanitary Commissioners were marked\r\ndown by the Committee for destruction. The whole edifice thus seemed to\r\nbe crumbling. This was what she had in her mind when, in the Jubilee\r\nretrospect quoted at the beginning of the chapter, she said that the\r\nwork of thirty years had all to be done again.\r\n\r\nShe turned with all her old energy to efforts commensurate to the\r\nthreatened calamity. In accordance with her usual method, she first\r\nconsulted many influential friends (Lord Ripon amongst others), and then\r\nacted with great energy. She wrote a long statement to Lord Dufferin\r\n(Nov. 5). \"I have sent your letter _in extenso_,\" he replied (Jan. 18,\r\n1887), \"to the head of the Finance Committee. You should understand that\r\nit does not at all follow, because the Committee recommend a thing, that\r\ntheir recommendation will, as a matter of course, be accepted by the\r\nGovernment. On the contrary, I will go most carefully into this\r\nquestion in which you naturally take so deep an interest, and will be\r\ncareful to have it thoroughly discussed in Council by my colleagues with\r\nthe advantage of having had your views placed before them.\" A few months\r\nlater came welcome news:--\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Dufferin to Miss Nightingale._) SIMLA, _August_ 20 [1887]. I\r\n     write you a little line to tell you that the Indian Government have\r\n     finally determined not to sanction the proposals of the Finance\r\n     Commission for the abolition of the Sanitary Commissioners, about\r\n     which you were naturally alarmed. There is no doubt that the\r\n     Finance Commission was in a position to prove that these officers\r\n     had been able to do very little, owing to the unwillingness, or\r\n     rather the inability of the local Authorities to supply funds, and\r\n     in some cases to their own listlessness and want of energy. We are\r\n     now, however, taking the question up, and the result of the attack\r\n     upon your protégés will be, not their disappearance, but their\r\n     being compelled to give us the worth of the money we spend upon\r\n     them. I am also inviting all the local governments to put the whole\r\n     subject of sanitation upon a more satisfactory footing, and to\r\n     establish a system of concerted action and a well-worked-out\r\n     programme in accordance with which from year to year their\r\n     operations are to be conducted. I cannot say how grateful I am to\r\n     Sir Harry Verney for his kindness in writing me such interesting\r\n     and pleasant letters. In them he tells me from time to time, I am\r\n     afraid I cannot say of your well-being, but of your unflagging\r\n     energy in the pursuit of your noble and useful aims.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Miss Nightingale had been busy with Ministers at home. In the\r\nlatter half of 1886 Lord Salisbury's Government was firmly seated, and\r\nshe received visits from the Secretaries of State for India and for War\r\n(Lord Cross and Mr. W. H. Smith). She found Lord Cross most sympathetic;\r\nhe saw her from time to time during following years, and they had a good\r\ndeal of correspondence. To Mr. W. H. Smith she paid her highest\r\ncompliment; in some ways he reminded her, she said in her notes, of\r\nSidney Herbert. Superficially, and in several of their real\r\ncharacteristics, no two men could be more unlike; but in certain\r\nrespects Mr. Smith resembled her ideal of a War Minister. He had a\r\nsincere concern for the welfare, alike physical and moral, of the\r\nsoldiers; and he showed a quick and industrious aptitude for\r\nadministrative detail. She saw Mr. Smith several times, and at his\r\nrequest had an interview with the Chaplain-General.[227] It seemed as if\r\nthe work, which she had done with Sidney Herbert, might be resumed with\r\nMr. Smith, when there was a thunder-clap from a clear sky. Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill resigned. The Ministry was for a while in confusion, and Miss\r\nNightingale in despair. \"We _are_ unlucky,\" she wrote to Sir Douglas\r\nGalton (Dec. 23). \"As soon as we seem to have got hold of two\r\nSecretaries of State, this Randolph goes out! The Cabinet will have to\r\nbe remodelled, and perhaps we shall lose our men. All the more reason\r\nfor doing something at once.\" Of her two \"men,\" the one was taken, the\r\nother left. Mr. W. H. Smith became First Lord of the Treasury, but Lord\r\nCross remained at the India Office. \"I am very sorry to give up the War\r\nOffice,\" said Mr. Smith to Miss Nightingale, \"but I am told it is my\r\nduty, and duty leaves no choice.\" She begged him to indoctrinate his\r\nsuccessor, Mr. Edward Stanhope. She was already acquainted with him, and\r\npresently he came to see her. It was with peculiar satisfaction that she\r\npresently heard of the Government's intention to take a loan for four\r\nmillions for the building of new barracks and the reconstruction of old\r\nones. This was a resumption of the work of Sidney Herbert, thirty years\r\nafter.[228]\r\n\r\n  [227] It was a subject of recurring self-reproach to Miss Nightingale in\r\n        subsequent years that she had not found time to follow up this\r\n        latter opening and organize a new crusade for the spiritual and\r\n        moral welfare of the soldiers. She had already done much in that\r\n        sort; and Mr. Jowett's equally recurring comment was to the point:\r\n        \"Why complain because you cannot do more than you do, which is\r\n        already more than any other ten women could do?\"\r\n\r\n  [228] A succinct statement of such reforms, up to 1899, was compiled by\r\n        Mr. Frederick on his retirement from the War Office and was issued\r\n        as a Blue-book: _Record of Recommendations regarding Sanitary\r\n        Improvements in Barracks and Hospitals together with the Actual\r\n        Improvements carried out during the last 50 years_.\r\n\r\nAn early intimation of this policy made Miss Nightingale the more\r\nanxious about the fate of the Army Sanitary Committee. If the sanitary\r\ncondition of the barracks was to be improved, it was all-important that\r\na strong Sanitary Committee should be in existence to supervise the\r\nwork. At first, however, she had been unable to secure any promise about\r\nthe Sutherland Succession. The War Office would not consider the matter\r\nuntil a vacancy occurred; the India Office would do nothing until it\r\nknew what the War Office meant to do. In 1888 the long threatened thing\r\nhappened. Dr. Sutherland resigned. No successor was appointed. The whole\r\nsubject, she was informed, was under consideration, and then under\r\nreconsideration. Ultimately Mr. Stanhope, after interviews with Miss\r\nNightingale, reconstituted the Committee (June 1890). Sir Douglas Galton\r\nremained upon it. Dr. J. Marston was appointed paid member in succession\r\nto Dr. Sutherland, and Miss Nightingale's friend and ally,\r\nSurgeon-General J. W. Cunningham (formerly Sanitary Commissioner with\r\nthe Government of India) was appointed as an Indian expert. Her friend\r\nMr. J. J. Frederick retained his post as Secretary to the Committee. The\r\ndanger was overpast.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nSanitary reports from India were still to be referred to the Committee,\r\nbut Miss Nightingale and some of her friends thought that the time had\r\ncome for an advance in India. Lord Cross was so sympathetic that the\r\noccasion seemed opportune for reviving her former plea for a sanitary\r\ndepartment in India which should be more directly _executive_. Sir Henry\r\nCunningham (married to a niece of Sir Harry Verney) had been in\r\ncommunication with her for some years. He was a judge of the High Court\r\nof Calcutta, and had taken an active part in the cause of sanitation in\r\nthat city. He now prepared a memorandum advocating a forward policy.\r\nMiss Nightingale's ally on the India Council, Sir Henry Yule, prepared\r\nanother, which was so far approved by the Secretary of State that he\r\nordered it to be circulated in the Office as the draft of a proposed\r\ndispatch to the Government of India. This draft was, in fact, the joint\r\nproduction of Sir Henry Cunningham, Colonel Yule, and Miss Nightingale.\r\nIt went the rounds. It was minuted on. It was considered and\r\nreconsidered; printed and reprinted. Sometimes the report to Miss\r\nNightingale was that it would be adopted and sent; at other times, that\r\nit had been postponed for further revision, recirculation, and\r\nreconsideration. Ultimately it became in some sort out of date, because\r\nthe Government of India took a step on its own motion, in accordance\r\nwith the intention which Lord Dufferin had already communicated to Miss\r\nNightingale (p. 373). By Resolution, dated July 27, 1888, the Government\r\nof India provided for the constitution of a Sanitary Board in every\r\nprovince, which would not only advise the Government and local\r\nauthorities upon sanitary measures, but would also be an executive\r\nagency. The passages in which the latter point is insisted upon might\r\nhave been written by Miss Nightingale herself.[229] Lord Dufferin's term\r\nof office was now drawing to a close. He had proved himself an apt pupil\r\nof the \"Governess of Governors-General.\" As on the voyage out he had\r\npromised to do her bidding, so now on the voyage home he gave some\r\naccount of his stewardship:--\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Dufferin to Miss Nightingale._) SS. KAISER-I-HIND _at sea,\r\n     Dec._ 26 [1888]. We are now on our way home and are having a\r\n     beautiful passage, thanks to which we are all picking up\r\n     wonderfully, and shall arrive in Europe quite rejuvenated. This is\r\n     merely a line to apologise for having sent you the Report of a\r\n     speech I made at Calcutta recently. I would not have troubled you\r\n     with it, were it not that on page 15 I have tried to give a parting\r\n     lift to sanitation.[230] My ladies go home at once, but I, alas, am\r\n     compelled to take up my business at Rome, so that I shall not get\r\n     my holiday for another two or three months. Amongst the first\r\n     persons whose hands I hope to come and kiss will be yours.\r\n\r\n  [229] The Resolution is printed at pp. 38-42 of vol. xx. of the annual\r\n        _Report of Sanitary Measures in India_ (1888). It contains on the\r\n        administrative side a history of the movement which was set on foot\r\n        by Miss Nightingale's \"second Royal Commission\" (1863). The\r\n        Secretary of State's dispatch (Jan. 10, 1889), approving of the\r\n        Resolution, is full of \"the Nightingale influence\" (vol. xxi.\r\n        p. 173): Colonel Yule's Minute was forwarded as an enclosure with\r\n        the dispatch (pp. 173-184).\r\n\r\n  [230] \"The Government has recently given its serious attention to the\r\n        subject of Sanitation, and has laid down the lines upon which, in\r\n        its opinion, sanitary reform should be applied to our towns and\r\n        villages. It has given Sanitation a local habitation and a name in\r\n        every great division of the Empire; and it has arranged for the\r\n        establishment of responsible central agencies from one end of the\r\n        country to the other, who will be in close communication with all\r\n        the local authorities within their respective jurisdictions\"\r\n        (Speech at Calcutta, Nov. 30, 1888).\r\n\r\nLord Dufferin was succeeded by Lord Lansdowne, who was introduced to\r\nMiss Nightingale by Mr. Jowett. She saw Lord Lansdowne twice before he\r\nleft for India, and they corresponded frequently on sanitary affairs.\r\n\"He did much for us in every way\" is her comment on his Viceroyalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the Sanitary Boards in India proceeded with due\r\nregard to \"the periods of Indian cosmogony,\" and Miss Nightingale\r\nwatched their formation and their proceedings carefully, putting in\r\nwords of encouragement, expostulation, or reminder, whenever and\r\nwherever an opportunity was offered or could be made. It was soon\r\napparent that the great obstacle to sanitary progress among the masses\r\nof India lay, where perhaps for many generations it is still likely to\r\nlie, in the immobility of immemorial custom, especially in the villages.\r\nEducation was making some slight impression, but the force of passive\r\nresistance, combined with lack of funds, prevented the hope of any rapid\r\nor signal advance. Recognition of these factors now led Miss Nightingale\r\nto concentrate her efforts upon Village Sanitation, and a scheme for\r\ncombining the power of education with a financial expedient formed the\r\nmotive for the last of her Indian campaigns.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale had been watching with the closest attention the Bombay\r\nVillage Sanitation Bill, a measure first projected in 1887. She analysed\r\nand criticized it, and sent her views to Lord Cross at the India Office,\r\nand to Lord Lansdowne and Lord Reay in India. Her main objection was to\r\nthe exclusion from the scope of the Bill of the smaller villages, an\r\nexclusion which did not figure in the revised draft of 1889. She wrote\r\nletters for circulation in India to Native Associations in explanation\r\nand support of Village Sanitation.[231] There was some slight stirring\r\nof Indian opinion, and Miss Nightingale's next concern was to give to it\r\narticulate expression in London. The holding of an International\r\nCongress of Hygiene and Demography in the autumn of 1891 furnished an\r\nopportunity. Sir Douglas Galton was Chairman of the Organizing Committee\r\nof the Congress, so that there was no difficulty in arranging for an\r\nIndian section. Miss Nightingale then circularized the Native\r\nAssociation in Bombay, begging that representatives might be sent to the\r\nCongress, and papers be contributed by Indian gentlemen. This was done,\r\nand Miss Nightingale interested herself greatly in the Congress. \"Sir\r\nHarry Verney,\" she wrote to Sir Douglas Galton (Aug. 1, 1891), \"renews\r\nhis invitations to Claydon to the native Indian delegates, 'three or\r\nfour at a time.' I have seen Mr. Bhownaggree, who seems to be acting for\r\nthe other native gentlemen, not yet come, and asked him to manage this,\r\nas is most suitable to these gentlemen. I may hope to see them one by\r\none, if I am able to be there. I have also seen (of Delegates) Sir\r\nWilliam Moore and Dr. Payne and Sir W. Wedderburn. Mr. Digby seems to be\r\ndoing a great work.[232] Do you remember that it is 30 years to-morrow\r\nsince Sidney Herbert died?\" The Congress was opened by the Prince of\r\nWales (Aug. 10), whose speech on the occasion formed the text of many\r\nleading articles in the press. People talked, he said, of \"preventable\r\ndiseases\"; but \"if preventable, why not prevented?\" It was, however, in\r\nthe Indian section that Miss Nightingale was most interested, and she\r\nused it to promote her schemes. The Bombay Village Sanitation Act was\r\nfailing to produce the desired results because there were no funds\r\ndefinitely allocated to sanitation. Sanitary education was making some\r\nlittle progress, but not enough, in view of the poverty of Indian\r\nvillages, to make it likely that _additional_ taxation would be borne.\r\nIn these circumstances might not some portion of the _existing_ taxation\r\n(the village \"cesses\") be appropriated to sanitation as a first charge?\r\n\"Until the minimum of sanitation is completed, until the cess of a\r\nparticular village has been appropriated to it, while typhoidal or\r\ncholeraic disease is still prevalent, should not the claims for any\r\ngeneral purposes be postponed?\" Such was Miss Nightingale's case. She\r\nhad a memorandum drawn up embodying it in short form, and canvassed for\r\nsignatures to it among members of the Indian section of the Congress.\r\nSir Douglas Galton, Sir George Birdwood, Sir William Guyer Hunter, Sir\r\nWilliam Wedderburn, Dr. Corfield, and Dr. Poore were among those who\r\nsigned it. Miss Nightingale then forwarded the Memorandum, with a\r\ncovering letter going more fully into the case, to the Secretary of\r\nState. She wrote at the same time to the Governor-General and to the\r\nGovernor of Bombay. Lord Cross received the communication very\r\nsympathetically, and forwarded it at once (April 1892) to the Government\r\nof India. Lord Lansdowne then circulated Miss Nightingale's dispatch\r\namong the Local Governments, and during following years a formidable\r\nmass of printed Papers accumulated, \"Reporting on the Proposals made by\r\nMiss Nightingale, relative to the Better Application of the Proceeds of\r\nVillage Cesses to the purposes of Sanitation.\" The official view, though\r\nnot unsympathetic to Miss Nightingale's object, was opposed to her\r\nfinancial expedient; it was thought that other purposes, especially the\r\nimprovement of roads, etc., had a claim prior to sanitation. \"It seems\r\nclear,\" wrote Sir William Wedderburn to her (July 7, 1893), \"that you\r\nhave most effectively drawn attention to the subject. The official\r\nreplies are what we might naturally expect, but reading between the\r\nlines I think they admit the justice of our contention, and have been\r\nimpressed by your action.\" Perhaps this was to some extent the case.\r\n\"You have most effectively drawn attention to the subject\"; that was,\r\nperhaps, the main service which during these years Miss Nightingale\r\nrendered to the cause of Indian sanitation. Certainly she was\r\nimportunate in asking successive Governors-General for reports of\r\nprogress; her importunity often caused them to jog the elbows of Local\r\nGovernments; and she may thus not unjustly be credited with such gradual\r\nprogress as was made. The final reply to Miss Nightingale's immediate\r\nsuggestion was sent in a dispatch to the Secretary of State (Mr. Fowler)\r\nfrom the Government of India in 1894 (March 28), enclosing letters on\r\nher Memorandum from the several Local Governments. The Government of\r\nIndia declined for various reasons to adopt her suggestion; but\r\nadmitting that something ought to be done, considered that \"sanitation\r\nin its simplest form of a pure water-supply and simple latrine\r\narrangements should be regarded as having to some extent a claim on\r\nProvincial revenues,\" and it promised \"to press this claim upon Local\r\nGovernments and Administrations as opportunity offers.\" A covering\r\nletter to Miss Nightingale from the Secretary of State (May 9, 1894),\r\nwhile informing her that Mr. Fowler \"is disposed to accept the view\r\ntaken by the Government of India,\" expressed the belief \"that India will\r\nbenefit by the renewed attention which your action has caused to be\r\ngiven to the important subject of rural sanitary reform.\" There are\r\npassages in some of the replies from Local Governments, enclosed in the\r\ndispatch, which bear out this belief.\r\n\r\n  [231] See Bibliography A, Nos. 115, 118, 119, 122, 123.\r\n\r\n  [232] Mr. S. Digby was acting as Hon. Secretary to the Indian Section of\r\n        the International Conference.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, on her own part, was diligent in appeals to Indian\r\ngentlemen to bestir themselves. She had an ally at this time in Sir\r\nWilliam Wilson Hunter, who, in his fortnightly summary of \"Indian\r\nAffairs\" in the _Times_, sometimes enforced her points or called\r\nattention to her writings. She had urged her friend to write a detailed\r\ndescription of the actual working of Indian administration, and this he\r\ndid in 1892.[233] The Preface to his book was a dedicatory letter to\r\nMiss Nightingale. In it he says that the book was written at her\r\nrequest, describes its scope, and thus concludes: \"Now that the work is\r\ndone, to whom can I more fitly dedicate it than to you, dear Miss\r\nNightingale--to you whose life has been a long devotion to the stricken\r\nones of the earth--to you whose deep sympathy with the peoples of India\r\nno years of suffering or of sickness are able to abate?\" In her own\r\npieces written at this date, Miss Nightingale preached more especially\r\nthe gospel of Health Missionaries for Rural India.[234] Some reference\r\nto progress made in this respect will be found in a later chapter\r\n(p. 406). She believed in State action, but no less in Self-help, and\r\nthis point of view is emphasized in a retrospect of her work for India\r\nwhich she wrote, or partly wrote, probably as hints for some vernacular\r\npublication, in 1889.[235] Some passages from the document, here\r\nrearranged, may fitly close this account of her later Indian work.\r\n\r\n  [233] _Bombay, 1885-1890: A Study in Indian Administration._\r\n\r\n  [234] Bibliography A, Nos. 132, 135.\r\n\r\n  [235] The document, unfortunately not complete, is in part typewritten\r\n        (with a few pencilled notes in Miss Nightingale's hand) and in part\r\n        in the handwriting of a lady who at this time rendered her some\r\n        secretarial assistance.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Nightingale saw in the Queen's Proclamation of 1858 a text and a\r\nliving principle to fulfil. Every Englishman and Englishwoman interested\r\nin India were bound in duty and in honour to do their utmost to help\r\nBritish subjects to understand the principle and to practise the life.\r\nTo this she has adhered through illness and overwork for thirty-one\r\nyears. First attracted to India by the vital necessity of health for 200\r\nor 250 millions, imperilled by sanitary ignorance, apathy, or neglect,\r\nshe believed it to be a fact that since the world began, criminals have\r\nnot destroyed more life and property than do epidemic diseases (the\r\nresult of well-known insanitary conditions) every year in India. The\r\nprotection of life and property from preventable epidemics ranks next to\r\nprotection from criminals, as a responsibility of Government, if indeed\r\nit is not even higher in importance. The first thing was to awaken the\r\nGovernment. This was done by the Royal Commission upon the Sanitary\r\nState of the Army in India, which was the origin of practical action for\r\nthe vast native population. But the difficulties were enormous. You must\r\nhave the people on your side. And the people, alas, did not care. You\r\ncannot give health to the people against their wills, as you can lock up\r\npeople against their wills. Impressed by these facts, Miss Nightingale\r\nsaw the necessity of Sanitary Missionaries among the people--of sanitary\r\nmanuals and primers in the schools ('Give me the--schools--of a country\r\nand I care not who makes its laws'); of sanitary publications of all\r\nkinds, for man, woman, and child. The Sanitary Commissioner, in one\r\ninstance at least,[236] has been a Sanitary Missionary, crying out,\r\n'Bestir yourselves, gentlemen, don't you see we are all dying?' The\r\npeople must be awakened, not to call on the Goddess of Epidemics, but to\r\ncall upon the Sirkar to do its part, and also to bestir themselves to do\r\ntheirs in the matter of cleanliness and pure water. Miss Nightingale\r\nfound in Local Government the only remedy; in Local Government combined\r\nwith Education.\" The Paper touches also upon Miss Nightingale's interest\r\nin irrigation, land-tenure, usury, agriculture, and in all these matters\r\nconnects State action with Self-help. \"To the native gentlemen it is\r\nthat Miss Nightingale appeals. She appeals to them also on the Sanitary\r\npoint. And first of all it is for them to influence their ladies. Let\r\nthem lead in their own families in domestic sanitation. Then, doubtless,\r\nthe lady will lead in general sanitation in India as she does in\r\nEngland.\" Another passage gives incidentally an autobiographical\r\nsummary. \"Miss Nightingale has deeply sympathized with the honourable\r\nefforts of the National Congress which has now held three Sessions, in\r\nwhich its temperate support of political reforms has been no less\r\nremarkable for wisdom than for loyalty. But her whole life has been\r\ngiven deliberately, _not_ for political, _but_ for social and\r\nadministrative progress.\"\r\n\r\n  [236] She refers no doubt to Dr. Hewlett.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VII\r\n\r\nAt the time when Miss Nightingale's Indian work was thus largely\r\nconcentrated upon village sanitation, she was no less busily employed,\r\nthough in a different way, upon work of a like kind at home. Her\r\ninterest in local affairs at Claydon has already been touched upon, and\r\nthis was much increased after the death of her sister in 1890. Lady\r\nVerney had been a sufferer for many years, but had borne her illness\r\nwith unflagging spirit. In May 1890 she was in London, very ill, and was\r\ncounting the hours to her removal to Claydon, but she would not give up\r\na Sunday in town--a day which Florence now kept sacred for her sister.\r\nOn Sunday May 4 Lady Verney was carried into Florence's room, and the\r\nsisters did not see each other again. On Monday Lady Verney was moved to\r\nClaydon, and there, a week later, on Florence's birthday, she died. \"You\r\ncontributed more than anyone,\" wrote Sir Harry (May 15), \"to what\r\nenjoyment of life was hers. I have no comfort so great as to hold\r\nintercourse with you. You and I were the objects of her tender love, and\r\nher love for you was intense. It was delightful to me to hear her speak\r\nof you, and to see her face, perhaps distorted with pain, look happy\r\nwhen she thought of you.\" Miss Nightingale at once went to Claydon,\r\nwhere she remained for several months. Sir Harry, now in his 90th year,\r\nrelied greatly upon his sister-in-law, and for the remainder of his life\r\nshe devoted herself to him with constant solicitude. He was never happy\r\nif many days passed without sight of her or hearing from her. The butler\r\nalways put Miss Nightingale's letter on the top of his master's morning\r\npile, and no mouthful of breakfast was eaten till he had read it\r\nthrough. When he was in the country and she in London, he was always\r\nwanting to run up to town for the day--to buy a new waistcoat, or to\r\nconsult his solicitor: any excuse would serve so that he could see his\r\nsister-in-law in South Street. They used to say at Claydon that there\r\nwas a sure way of discovering whether Sir Harry found a new guest\r\nsympathetic or not: if he did, the conversation was invariably turned to\r\nMiss Nightingale. Upon the death of her sister, Claydon became Miss\r\nNightingale's country-home, and she brought her managerial thoroughness\r\ninto play there. She looked into Sir Harry's affairs, interested herself\r\ngreatly in the estate, inquired into the conditions of surrounding\r\nvillage life, made acquaintance with local doctors. These interests\r\nbrought home to her the conviction that village sanitation was necessary\r\nto civilize England hardly less than India, and she saw that as in\r\nIndia, so in England, education must be one at least of the civilizing\r\nagencies. She set herself to make a beginning where her lot now happened\r\nto be cast, in Buckinghamshire.\r\n\r\nThe time was favourable to a new experiment. County Councils had been\r\nestablished by the Act of 1888. In 1889 they were empowered to levy and\r\nexpend money upon Technical Education. By the Local Taxation Act of 1890\r\nthey received a windfall for the same purpose from what was known as the\r\n\"Whisky Money.\" Funds were thus available, and the definition of\r\n\"technical\" education was wide. Why should not some of it be used for\r\neducation in the science of \"Health at Home\"? Mr. Frederick Verney was\r\nchairman of the Technical Education Committee of North Bucks, and with\r\nMiss Nightingale, as he said, \"to inspire, advise, and guide,\" the thing\r\nwas done. She was already, as we have heard, possessed by the idea of\r\nthe district nurse as health missioner. It now occurred to her to\r\ninstitute an order of health-missioners as such. The Health Officer for\r\nthe district (Dr. De'Ath) was first employed to train ladies for the\r\nwork by means of lectures and classes. The instruction was practical as\r\nwell as theoretical, for the doctor took his pupils with him to some of\r\nthe villages, introduced the ladies to the village mothers, and pointed\r\nout particular matters in which knowledge sympathetically given might be\r\ninvaluable to the cottagers. An independent examination followed, and\r\nthe ladies who passed it satisfactorily were, after a period of\r\nprobation in practical work, granted certificates as Health Missioners,\r\nin which capacity some of them were engaged by the Technical Education\r\nCommittee to visit and lecture in the country villages. The scheme,\r\nstarted in the spring of 1892, was a simple one, but it involved Miss\r\nNightingale, as huge bundles of documents attest, in much labour for two\r\nor three years. She enlisted recruits; collected the best that was known\r\nand thought about simple sanitary instruction; considered syllabuses and\r\nexamination papers; corresponded with other Technical Education\r\nCommittees; wrote memoranda and letters on the subject.[237] To the\r\nWomen Workers' Conference, held at Leeds in November 1893, she sent a\r\npaper dealing exhaustively with the whole subject of Rural Hygiene--a\r\npaper which is unhappily by no means out of date to-day, though the\r\nwork, in which Miss Nightingale was a pioneer, has branched out in many\r\ndirections. \"We want duly qualified Sanitary Inspectors,\" she wrote, and\r\nshe was delighted when she heard a few years later of the good work done\r\nby some women sanitary inspectors in the north. Full qualification,\r\npractical training, she insisted upon; and then something else was\r\nwanted also. Her last word to the Health Missioner was the same as to\r\nthe Nurse. \"The work that tells is the work of the skilful hand,\r\ndirected by the cool head, and inspired by the loving heart.\"\r\n\r\n  [237] See Bibliography A, Nos. 126, 133, 134.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                       MR. JOWETT AND OTHER FRIENDS\r\n\r\n     Let every dawn of morning be to you as the beginning of life, and\r\n     every setting sun be to you as its close--then let every one of\r\n     these short lives leave its sure record of some kindly thing done\r\n     for others.--RUSKIN.\r\n\r\nThe last chapter was largely concerned with Miss Nightingale's activity\r\nin public affairs and with acquaintanceships which she formed in\r\nconnection with them. In such affairs she was forcible, clear-sighted,\r\nmethodical. Sir Bartle Frere, on first making her acquaintance, had said\r\nto a friend that it was \"a great pleasure to meet such a good man of\r\nbusiness as Miss Nightingale.\" But she was many-sided, and even in her\r\nconverse with men or women on public affairs she was generally something\r\nmore than a good \"man of business.\" Much of her influence was due to the\r\nfact that so many of those who first saw her as a matter of affairs\r\nbecame her friends, and that to the qualities of a good man of business\r\nshe added those of a richly sympathetic nature.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of Miss Nightingale's life and character has already been\r\nillustrated sufficiently in the case of her relations with Matrons,\r\nSuperintendents, and Nurses. It may be discerned clearly enough, too, in\r\nthe account of her official work with Sidney Herbert and other of her\r\nearlier allies. But it was as marked in her later as in her earlier\r\nyears, and in relation to the men as to the women with whom she was\r\nbrought into touch. In reading her collection of letters from various\r\ndoctors and officials of all sorts, I have been struck many times with a\r\nquick change of atmosphere. The correspondence begins on a formal note.\r\nHer correspondent will be \"pleased to make the acquaintance of a lady so\r\njustly esteemed,\" etc., etc. The interview has taken place, or a few\r\nletters have passed, and then the note alters. Wives or sons or\r\ndaughters have been to see her, or kindly inquiries and messages have\r\nbeen sent, and the correspondence becomes as between old family friends.\r\nYoung and old alike felt the sympathetic touch of Miss Nightingale's\r\nmanner. The name of Mr. J. J. Frederick has been mentioned in earlier\r\npages. He was a junior clerk in the War Office when Miss Nightingale\r\nfirst made his acquaintance. Not many months had passed before she was\r\nhelpfully interested both in his family and in various good works to\r\nwhich he devoted his spare time. There is much correspondence, during\r\nthe years with which we were concerned in the last chapter, with\r\nMr. (now Sir Robert) Morant, at that time tutor in the Royal Family of\r\nSiam. Miss Nightingale had made his acquaintance before he left for\r\nSiam; and he came to see her when he was on leave in England, \"leave\r\napparently meaning,\" she wrote (Sept. 24, 1891), \"working on his Siamese\r\nsubjects 23 hours out of the 24.\" She became almost as much interested\r\nin Siamese affairs as in those of India itself; but the letters show\r\nthat the public interest was combined with a personal, and almost\r\nmotherly, affection. Mr. J. Croft, on the staff at St. Thomas's, who had\r\nfor many years been medical instructor to the Nightingale Probationers,\r\nresigned that post in 1892, and in returning thanks for a testimonial\r\ndescribed the pleasure he had found in working under \"so lovable and\r\nadorable a leader as Miss Nightingale.\" Colonel Yule had first made Miss\r\nNightingale's acquaintance in an official capacity as the member of the\r\nIndia Council charged with sanitary affairs, but he soon came to love\r\nher as a friend. In 1889 he was ill, and wrote her a valedictory letter\r\n(May 2), in which, after giving advice about some official matters, he\r\nsaid: \"As long as I live, but I am not counting on that as a long\r\nperiod, it will be a happiness to think that I was brought into\r\ncommunication with you--useless as I fear I have been in your great\r\ntask: in fact my strength had already begun to fail. And so, dear Miss\r\nNightingale, I take my leave: let it be with the words of the 4th Book\r\nof Moses, ch. vi., and those that come after us will put in your mouth\r\nthose of Job, xxix.\"[238] His strength failed more rapidly; and in his\r\nlast illness he craved to know that Miss Nightingale had not forgotten\r\nhim. She sent him a message of fervent gratitude. \"I will look at it not\r\nas misapplied to myself,\" he answered (Dec. 17, a few days before his\r\ndeath), \"but as part of the large and generous nature which you are\r\nready to apply to others who little deserve it. I praise God for the\r\nprivilege of having known you. I am sunk very low in strength, and\r\ncannot write with my own hand, so use that of one of my oldest and\r\ndearest friends. God bless and keep you to the end, as you have been for\r\nso many years, a pillar in Christ's Kingdom of Love and of this state of\r\nEngland. Ever, with the deepest affection and veneration, your faithful\r\nservant, H. Yule.\" The strength of her older friend and fellow-worker,\r\nDr. Sutherland, ebbed rapidly, and he did not long survive his\r\nretirement. He died in July 1891. He was in great weakness at the end,\r\nand was hardly able to read or to speak; but his wife said that she had\r\nreceived a letter from Miss Nightingale with messages for him. To her\r\nsurprise he roused himself once more, read the letter through, and said,\r\n\"Give her my love and blessing.\" They were almost his last words.\r\n\r\n  [238] Numbers vi. 24-26: \"The Lord bless thee, and keep thee,\" etc. Job\r\n        xxxi. 11-16: \"When the ear heard me, then it blessed me,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThe affectionate sympathy which Miss Nightingale gave to her friends was\r\nnot lacking to her relations. In 1889 one of the dearest of them, her\r\n\"Aunt Mai,\" had died at the age of 91. Her husband, the \"Uncle Sam\" of\r\nearlier chapters, had died eight years before; and the widow's\r\nbereavement seems to have done away with such estrangement as there had\r\nbeen between her and her niece. They resumed their former affectionate\r\ncorrespondence on religious matters, and Miss Nightingale was again the\r\n\"loving Flo\" of earlier years. \"Dearest friend,\" she wrote on the card\r\nsent with flowers when her aunt died; \"lovely, loving soul; humble mind\r\nof high and holy thought.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was not one of those persons who keep their tact and\r\nkindly consideration for the outside world and think indolent\r\nindifference or rough candour good enough for the family circle. I have\r\nbeen told a little anecdote which is instructive in this connection.\r\nMiss Irby came into the garden hall at Lea Hurst one day, fresh from an\r\ninterview with Miss Nightingale. \"I must tell you,\" she said, laughing,\r\nto one of Miss Nightingale's younger cousins, \"what Florence has just\r\nsaid; it's so like her. She said to me, 'I wonder whether R. remembered\r\nto have that branch taken away that fell across the south drive.' I\r\nsaid, 'I will ask her.' 'Oh, no,' said Florence, 'don't ask her that.\r\nAsk her _whom_ she asked to take the branch away.'\" This is only a\r\ntrifle; but the method of the thing was very characteristic. Miss\r\nNightingale was a diplomatist in small affairs as in great. She was\r\ncareful not to run a risk of making mischief through intermediaries. She\r\ntook real trouble to that end, and never seemed to find anything in this\r\nsort too much to do. Her influence with every member of her family was\r\nused to make relations between them better and more affectionate. With\r\nmany of the younger generation of her cousins and other kinsfolk she\r\nmaintained affectionate relations. She regulated her hours very\r\nstrictly, as we have heard, but she found time, especially in her later\r\nyears, to see some of these young friends repeatedly. When she did not\r\nsee them, she liked to be informed of their comings and goings, their\r\ndoings and prospects, their marriages and belongings. She held in deep\r\naffection the memory of Arthur Hugh Clough, and she loved tenderly her\r\ncousin, Mr. Shore Smith. She entertained a generous solicitude for Mr.\r\nClough's family; and the family of her cousin, Shore, were especially\r\nclose to her. A little note to Mrs. Shore Smith--one of\r\nhundreds--illustrates incidentally Miss Nightingale's love of flowers\r\nand their insect friends:--\r\n\r\n     10 SOUTH STREET, _April_ 24, 1894. Dearest, I feel so anxious to\r\n     know how you are. Thank you so much for your beautiful Azaleas\r\n     which have come out splendidly, and the yellow tulips. The smell\r\n     of the Azaleas reminds me so of Embley. On a tulip sat a poor\r\n     little tiny, tiny, pretty little snail of a sort unknown to me. He\r\n     said: \"I was so happy in my garden on my tulip, and I was kidnapped\r\n     into that horrid box. And whatever am I to do?\" So we carried him\r\n     out and carefully put him among the shrubs in the boxes on the\r\n     leads (lilacs). But my opinion is that he is very particular about\r\n     his diet and that his opinion was that he could find nothing worthy\r\n     of his acceptance there. He must either have been drowned in the\r\n     water-spout, or dree'd the penalty of being particular. Now I\r\n     return to our brutality in letting you go without even partaking of\r\n     \"Baby's bottle.\" My kindest regards to Baby and its Mama. Ever your\r\n     loving F. N.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was godmother to Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Bonham Carter's son,\r\nMalcolm. With Norman, an Indian Civilian, a younger son of Mr. Henry\r\nBonham Carter, she kept up a correspondence. She was much attached to\r\nMiss Edith Bonham Carter,[239] who had taken up nursing, and there were\r\nseveral other relations who saw her and in whom she was much interested.\r\nThe number of family letters which she preserved is very large; and\r\namong them those relating to the family into which her sister had\r\nmarried are almost as numerous as those relating to her own kith and\r\nkin. For Margaret Lady Verney, in particular, Miss Nightingale\r\nentertained a deep admiration and a most tender affection. She was\r\nattached also to Sir Harry's younger son, Mr. Frederick Verney, who in\r\nthese later years helped her in many of her undertakings, and whom she\r\nin turn helped greatly in his. A few of her own family letters, covering\r\na large space of time, will best show the pleasantly affectionate terms,\r\nnow grave, now gay, on which she placed herself with her relations:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Mrs. Clough._) 35 SOUTH STREET, _Jan._ 2 [1873]. I lit upon\r\n     the edition of Byron (without _Don Juan_) which we wished for.\r\n     There are two vols. more than in our edition, which may be trash.\r\n     But _Childe Harold_,--the descriptions of Greece in the Tale:\r\n     Poems,--Chillon,--but above all _Manfred_: there is nothing like it\r\n     in the world, especially the last scene. The Spirit there is really\r\n     a spirit--the only spirit out of Job and Saul. The Ghost in\r\n     _Hamlet_ is surely a very gross unpleasant dead-alive unburied man,\r\n     with the most vulgar full-bodied sentiments, clamouring for\r\n     vengeance on his murderer (not even so spirit-like as a dying man),\r\n     quite unlike what his son describes him--a Thief and Impostor, I am\r\n     sure, going to take the spoons. _Manfred_, to my mind, stands\r\n     alone, and is the most spiritual view of immortality, of what hell\r\n     and heaven really are, of any poetry in the world. One only wonders\r\n     how Byron ever wrote it.\r\n\r\n     (_To a niece_,[240] _who was going to College._) 10 SOUTH STREET,\r\n     _August_ 22 [1881]. MY VERY DEAREST R.--Aunt Florence is filled\r\n     with you and your going to Girton. I can say nothing I would and,\r\n     saying nothing, I would ask those greatest of the\r\n     \"heathens\"--Plato, Aeschylus, Thucydides--to say much to you.\r\n     Aeschylus, whose _Prometheus_ is evidently a foreshadowing of, or,\r\n     if you like it better, the same type (with Osiris of Egypt) as,\r\n     Christ: the one who brought \"gifts to men,\" who defied \"the powers\r\n     that be\" (the \"principalities\" and \"powers\" of evil), who suffered\r\n     for men in bringing them the \"best gifts\" (the \"fire from heaven\"),\r\n     who _could_ only give by suffering himself, and who finally \"led\r\n     captivity captive.\" It seems to me that I see in nothing so much\r\n     the _history of God_--in the religions of the world which M. Mohl\r\n     learnt Oriental languages to write--as in these great\r\n     \"heathens\"--Persian, Chinese, Indian, Greek also, and Latin too,\r\n     but specially Aeschylus and Plato; and perhaps, too, in\r\n     Physiology--the _greatness_ of His work, the silence of His work,\r\n     what spirit He is of. His \"glory\" and poorness of spirit--and that\r\n     to be \"poor of spirit\" constitutes His glory, if to be poor of\r\n     spirit means utter unselfishness, perfect freedom from self and\r\n     from the very thought of self, and from affectations and from\r\n     \"_vain_ glory.\" My very dearest child, fare you very well--very,\r\n     very well is the deepest prayer of AUNT FLORENCE.\r\n\r\n     (_To a niece who had taken up vegetarianism._) 10 SOUTH STREET,\r\n     _Nov._ 8 [1887]. DEAREST--I send you two \"vegetables\" in their\r\n     shells. We shall have some more fresh ones to-morrow. A new potato\r\n     is, I assure you, _not_ a vegetable. It is a mare's egg, laid by\r\n     her, you know, in a \"mare's nest.\" No vegetarian would eat it. I\r\n     send you some Egyptian lentils. I have them every night for supper,\r\n     done in milk, which I am not very fond of. The delicious thing is\r\n     lentil soup, as made every day by an Arab cook in Egypt, over a\r\n     handful of fire not big enough to roast a mosquito.... Ever your\r\n     loving AUNT FLORENCE.\r\n\r\n     (_To a niece, who was full of the co-operative movement._) 10\r\n     SOUTH STREET, _July_ 14 [1888]. DEAREST--Your co-operative\r\n     usefulness is delightful. If it is not in the lowest degree vulgar,\r\n     I should ask if I might give them some books. But I suppose this is\r\n     contrary to all Co-operative principle. Lady Ashburton is gone to\r\n     Marienbad, to distribute Bibles and Tracts in Czech-ish. There is a\r\n     very large Co-operative Estate about 20 miles distant on the\r\n     borders of the Forest, which she has seen and believes to be\r\n     entirely successful. And I have charged her to send me home (for\r\n     you) details--and of course to prove its success. You see how my\r\n     manners and principles have been corrupted by you, the youthful\r\n     prophet. If you observe aberration, do not lay it at my door. It is\r\n     sad how youth corrupts old age. Your faithful and loving old\r\n     (co-operative) Aunt, FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\n     (_To Mrs. Vaughan Nash._) CLAYDON HOUSE, _Jan._ 3 [1895]. I have\r\n     never thanked you, except in my heart, which is always, for my\r\n     beautiful book--Villari's _History of Florence_: its first two\r\n     centuries. It does look so interesting, and I have always been\r\n     interested in Florentine history above all others. I think it was\r\n     from studying Sismondi's _Républiques Italiennes_ when I was a\r\n     young girl (book now despised--you rascal!) and from knowing\r\n     Sismondi himself afterwards at Geneva. The end of this Villari does\r\n     look so very enthralling, where he traces the causes of the decline\r\n     and fall of the Florentine Republic--its very wealth and commerce\r\n     assisting its ruin, and shows how its \"Commune\" could not develop\r\n     into a \"State\" (that may help some reflections on Indian Village\r\n     Communities). But I do not see that he shows--tho' as I am reading\r\n     backwards, like the Devil, I may come to it--how different were the\r\n     Florentine ideas of Liberty from ours. With them it was that\r\n     everybody should have a share in governing everybody else; with us,\r\n     that everybody should have the power of self-development without\r\n     hurting anybody else. I remember Villari's _Savonarola_ well: it\r\n     must have been published 30 or 40 years ago. (I always had an\r\n     enthusiasm for Savonarola.) It was heavy, learned, impartial,\r\n     exhaustive. It was my father's book: he read it much. I think I\r\n     told you that I possess copies of the last things that Savonarola\r\n     ever wrote--Commentaries on two Psalms--not a word against his\r\n     enemies and persecutions, or any mention of them, or indeed any\r\n     lamentation at all, but all one long and fervent aspiration after a\r\n     perfect re-union with the Father of light and love. Good Fenzi,\r\n     Evelina Galton's husband, had these copies made for me from the\r\n     originals in the Palazzo Vecchio.\r\n\r\n     (_To Norman Bonham Carter._) 10 SOUTH STREET, _August_ 2 [1895]....\r\n     You will see by the accounts of the General Election how the\r\n     Conservatives have got in by an enormous majority, and the Liberals\r\n     are discomfited. But I am an old fogey, and have been at this work\r\n     for 40 years. And I have always found that the man who has the\r\n     genius to know how to find details, and the still greater genius of\r\n     knowing how to apply them will win, and party does not signify at\r\n     all. My masters[241]--that is, Sir Robert Peel's school, never\r\n     cared for place, but always worked for both sides alike. I learn\r\n     the lesson of life from a little kitten of mine, one of two. The\r\n     old cat comes in and says, very cross, \"I didn't ask you in here, I\r\n     like to have my Missis to myself!\" And he runs at them. The bigger\r\n     and handsomer kitten runs away, but the littler one _stands her\r\n     ground_, and when the old enemy comes near enough kisses his nose,\r\n     and makes the peace. That is the lesson of life, to kiss one's\r\n     enemy's nose, always standing one's ground. I am rather sorry for\r\n     Lord Salisbury. A majority is always in the wrong.\r\n\r\n     (_To Louis Shore Nightingale._[242]) 10 SOUTH STREET, _Dec._ 21\r\n     [1896]. I have been thinking a great deal of what you said on both\r\n     sides about a Church at Lea. I wish you could consult some one, not\r\n     Church-y, like Harry B. C., upon it. What you say that, if the\r\n     Church is to be done, the proprietors and trustees of Lea Hurst\r\n     should not set themselves against it is true. The Church is like\r\n     the Wesleyans, another Christian sect--not to be put down. On the\r\n     other hand, the Church is now more like the Scribes and Pharisees\r\n     than like Christ. The Bishops and the High Church look upon work\r\n     among Dissenters as work among the heathen. They would upset all\r\n     the present work in Lea and Holloway if they could. Christ would\r\n     have laughed at the \"Validity of Orders\" difficulty of the present\r\n     day. He would have no dogma. His Dogmas were, He tells us\r\n     distinctly, Unselfishness, Love to God and our neighbour. He takes\r\n     the Ten Commandments to pieces and shows us the spirit of them\r\n     (without which they are nothing) in the Sermon on the Mount. He\r\n     even ridicules Sabbath observance. What are now called the\r\n     \"essential doctrines\" of the Christian religion He does not even\r\n     mention. A High Churchman and especially a H. Ch.'s wife would\r\n     upset everything.... Ever your loving AUNT F.\r\n\r\n     (_To Norman Bonham Carter._) _August_ 27 [1897].... I wish you\r\n     God-speed, my dear friend. India is a glorious field, provided you\r\n     keep out of \"little wars.\" As you are not a military man, there is\r\n     just a chance that you may not have perverse views on this subject.\r\n     I see Charlie sometimes. He is a very good fellow, tho' a military\r\n     man. But then his mind is not warped by \"Frontier Wars.\" And I know\r\n     at Dublin he did a good deal for the men. One of our nurses, Sister\r\n     Snodgrass, who died just after she had gone out to foreign service,\r\n     was some years in Dublin military fever wards. She did so much for\r\n     them, and got many of her orderlies to reform their lives. When\r\n     they heard of her death, they cried like children. I know how hard\r\n     worked you are. So am I. But your Father helps me with his\r\n     excellent judgment. God bless you.\r\n\r\n     (_To Louis Shore Nightingale._) 10 SOUTH ST., _Dec._ 23 [1898]. I\r\n     send a small contribution to your journey. I approve of\r\n     Switzerland, but wish you could prick on to Italy. I always do. If\r\n     you make a bother about this bit of paper, you will find that, in\r\n     the words of the immortal Shakespeare, \"Ravens shall pick out your\r\n     eyes and eagles eat the same.\" I have the Doctor coming this\r\n     afternoon, whom I dare not put off, from considerations of the same\r\n     nature. If you are so good as to come, please come at 5--for only\r\n     half an hour, that is till 5.30.\r\n\r\n  [239] Daughter of Mr. John Bonham Carter (see Vol. I. p. 29).\r\n\r\n  [240] Not really a niece, but Miss Nightingale was \"Aunt Florence\" to all\r\n        her cousins in the second generation; as also to the children of\r\n        some old friends.\r\n\r\n  [241] She was writing, it will be observed, on the anniversary of Sidney\r\n        Herbert's death.\r\n\r\n  [242] Younger son of Mr. Shore Smith, who had assumed the name of\r\n        Nightingale in 1893.\r\n\r\nMultiply such letters largely; add to them letters of a like kind,\r\n_mutatis mutandis_, addressed to her \"children\" in the nursing world;\r\nbring further into count her solicitude for servants and dependents: and\r\nit will be seen how faithfully Miss Nightingale followed the words\r\nplaced at the head of this chapter--words which she had copied out as \"A\r\nNew Year's Greeting\" for 1889. She had a soft place in her heart even\r\nfor criminals who despitefully used her. In July 1892 burglary was\r\ncommitted in her house in South Street. It was in the early morning, and\r\nshe espied the burglar resting for a moment with his spoils (some of her\r\nplate and her maid's money) in a hiding-place behind the house. If her\r\nmaids or the police or both had been more alert, the malefactor would\r\nhave been arrested. Her sense for efficiency was outraged, but she\r\nrelented when the Inspector came to see her. \"Perhaps it was just as\r\nwell that you didn't catch the man,\" she said with a twinkle, \"for I am\r\nafraid you don't do them much good when you lock them up.\" She was fond\r\nof the police, and during the Jubilee year admired from her window their\r\nhandling of the crowds. She noted the long hours; made friends with the\r\nInspector at Grosvenor Gate, and sent supplies of hot tea and cakes for\r\nhis men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThere was a time, as we have heard, when Miss Nightingale's friendship\r\nwith Mr. Jowett, though it did not diminish, yet became sensible, on her\r\nside at least, of a certain discomfort;[243] but that time was short.\r\nLater years brought occasion for a renewal of more effective sympathy;\r\nand as old age began to steal upon them, the friends held closer\r\ntogether. Mr. Jowett was deeply interested in many of Miss Nightingale's\r\nlater Indian interests--especially in those that related to education,\r\nwhether in India itself or of Indians and Indian civil servants in this\r\ncountry. He introduced to her Miss Cornelia Sorabji, whom he befriended\r\nat Oxford. He talked and corresponded much with Miss Nightingale about\r\nUniversity courses in relation to India. \"I want to prove to you,\" he\r\nwrote (Oct. 14, 1887), \"that your words do sometimes affect my flighty\r\nor stony heart and are not altogether cast to the winds. Therefore I\r\nsend you the last report of the Indian Students, in which you will\r\nperceive that agricultural chemistry has become a reality; and that,\r\nowing to YOU (though I fear that, like so many other of your good deeds,\r\nthis will never be known to men), Indian Students are reading about\r\nagriculture, and that therefore Indian Ryots may have a chance of being\r\nsomewhat better fed than hitherto.\" When Lord Lansdowne had settled down\r\nin India, Mr. Jowett thought that he might without impertinence write to\r\nhis friend and tell him what he should do to become \"a really great\r\nViceroy.\" What should be suggested? Perhaps Miss Nightingale would\r\nconsider? She took the hint most seriously: the education of Viceroys\r\nwas a favourite occupation with her. Without disclosing the particular\r\noccasion, she took many advisers into council, and discussed with them\r\nwhat reforms might most usefully be introduced. She forwarded her views\r\nto Oxford, and they filtered through Mr. Jowett to Simla. Mr. Jowett\r\ncontinued throughout these years to see Miss Nightingale frequently, and\r\ngenerally stayed with her once or twice a year--either in London or at\r\nClaydon. In 1887 he was staying in South Street when he was taken ill.\r\nMiss Nightingale found him \"a very wilful patient\"; he would not take\r\nthe complete rest which she and the doctor considered essential; and she\r\nhad to enter into a secret plot with Robert Browning to keep him from\r\nthe excitement of seeing friends. \"I am greatly ashamed,\" he wrote on\r\nhis return to Oxford (Oct. 13), \"at the trouble and interference to your\r\nwork which I caused. The recollection of your infinite kindness will\r\nnever fade from my mind.\" She sent him elaborate instructions for the\r\nbetter care of his \"Brother Ass,\" the body. \"How can I thank you enough\r\nfor your never ending kindness to me? May God bless you 1000 times in\r\nyour life and in your work. I sometimes think I gossip to you too much.\r\nIt is due to your kindness and sympathy, and you know that I have no one\r\nelse to gossip to.\" From this time forward Miss Nightingale was\r\nconstantly solicitous about her friend's health, and entered into\r\nregular correspondence with his housekeeper, Miss Knight, who was\r\ngrateful for being allowed to share her anxieties with so high an\r\nauthority on matters of health. During Mr. Jowett's illnesses, Miss\r\nNightingale had daily letters or telegrams sent to her reporting the\r\npatient's condition in much detail. This was her regular practice in the\r\ncase of relations or friends for whom she was solicitous. Such bulletins\r\nwere especially numerous during the fatal illness of her cousin, Miss\r\nHilary Bonham Carter. Miss Nightingale thought, no doubt, that her\r\nrequest for daily particulars would keep the nurses up to the mark; and\r\nsometimes it was that she had herself recommended the nurse. There were\r\nbulletins of the kind sent to her about Lady Rosebery, whose\r\nacquaintance she had made, as already related, in 1882. Lord Rosebery\r\nwas during some years an occasional caller at South Street.\r\n\r\n  [243] See above, p. 240.\r\n\r\nThe friendship of Miss Nightingale and Mr. Jowett was to have been\r\ncommemorated between themselves in an interesting way, for Mr. Jowett\r\ndesired to contribute towards a scheme which occupied much of Miss\r\nNightingale's time during 1890 and 1891. It was connected with one of\r\nthe ruling thoughts of her life. She was, as I have said, a Passionate\r\nStatistician. Statistics were to her almost a religious exercise. The\r\ntrue function of theology was to ascertain \"the character of God.\" Law\r\nwas \"the thought of God.\" It was by the aid of statistics that law in\r\nthe social sphere might be ascertained and codified, and certain aspects\r\nof \"the character of God\" thereby revealed. The study of statistics was\r\nthus a religious service. In the sphere of immediate application, she\r\nhad pointed out thirty years before[244] that there were enormous masses\r\nof statistical data, already pigeon-holed in government offices or\r\neasily procurable by government action, of which little or no use was\r\nmade. Statistics, said Lord Brougham, in a passage already quoted, were\r\nto the legislator as the compass or the lead to the navigator; but the\r\nactual course of legislation was too often conducted without any such\r\ncompass or lead at all. \"The Cabinet Ministers,\" she now wrote,[245]\r\n\"the army of their subordinates, the Houses of Parliament have for the\r\nmost part received a University education, but no education in\r\nstatistical method.\" The result was that legislation is \"not\r\nprogressive, but see-saw-y.\" \"We legislate without knowing what we are\r\ndoing. The War Office has on some subjects the finest statistics in the\r\nworld. What comes of them? Little or nothing. Why? Because the Heads\r\ndon't know how to make anything of them (with the two exceptions of\r\nSidney Herbert and W. H. Smith). Our Indian statistics are really better\r\non some subjects than those of England. Of these no use is made in\r\nadministration. What we want is not so much (or at least not at present)\r\nan accumulation of facts as to teach the men who are to govern the\r\ncountry the use of statistical facts.\" She gave particular instances of\r\nthe kind of questions which she desired to see thoroughly explored by\r\nthe statistical method. What had been the result of twenty years of\r\ncompulsory education? What proportion of children forget all that they\r\nlearnt at school? What result has the school-teaching on the life and\r\nconduct of those who do not forget it? Or, again, what is the effect of\r\ntown life on offspring, in number and in health? What are the\r\ncontributions of the several classes (as to social position and\r\nresidence) to the population of the next generation? Some of the\r\nquestions which she hoped to see solved by the statistical method came\r\nnear to those with which a later generation is familiar under the name\r\nof Eugenics. Her friend M. Quetelet had made a beginning in the science\r\nof \"Social Physics.\" Both he and Dr. Farr had hoped that she would carry\r\non the work. She had often talked with Mr. Jowett on the subject, and\r\nnow a scheme was suggested. She would give a sum of money, and he a like\r\namount, and between them they would found at Oxford a Professorship or\r\nLectureship in Applied Statistics. They agreed first to consult various\r\nfriends and experts. Mr. Jowett seems to have discussed the matter with\r\nMr. Arthur Balfour and Professor Alfred Marshall. Of Mr. Balfour, he\r\nwrote (Dec. 4, 1890) that \"he has more head and power of thinking than\r\nany statesman whom I have ever known.\" Miss Nightingale on her side\r\ncalled into council Mr. Francis Galton, who took up the idea warmly and\r\nelaborated a detailed scheme. He raised, however, a preliminary\r\nobjection. A Professor at Oxford or Cambridge of any subject which is\r\nnot a principal element in an examination \"School\" is a Professor\r\nwithout a class, and often sinks into somnolence. He suggested that the\r\nProfessorship would be more useful if attached to the Royal Institution.\r\nMr. Jowett, who had perhaps entered into the scheme from interest rather\r\nin Miss Nightingale than in the subject, was not very helpful in matters\r\nof detail, but he was ready to acquiesce in any scheme which Miss\r\nNightingale adopted. He made only two conditions; first, that he should\r\nbe allowed to contribute; and next, that the Professorship should be\r\ncalled by her name. Mr. Galton went on with his plans which, as they\r\nwere developed, were found to require a very large sum of money. Miss\r\nNightingale, whose resources were in great part tied up by settlements,\r\nconsulted her trustees. They did not deny that she could put down\r\n£4000,--the sum which Mr. Galton's scheme seemed to require as her\r\ncontribution,--but they were not passionate statisticians and did not\r\nunderrate the objections to such a gift. Meanwhile time was passing;\r\nMr. Galton was busy with other things, and Miss Nightingale herself,\r\nbeing much occupied during this year (1891) with other affairs, laid the\r\nscheme aside.\r\n\r\n  [244] See Vol. I. p. 435.\r\n\r\n  [245] In a letter of 1891 to Mr. Jowett.\r\n\r\nMr. Jowett, moreover, was very ill in the same year--having a serious\r\nheart attack, from which he barely recovered and which was premonitory\r\nof the end. At the beginning of October he spent a few days at Claydon\r\nwith Sir Harry Verney and Miss Nightingale. On returning to Oxford he\r\nwas worse. \"You will be tired of hearing from me,\" he said to her in a\r\ndictated letter of farewell (Oct. 16), \"and I begin to think that I may\r\nas well cease. Many interesting things have been revealed to me in my\r\nillness, of which I should like to talk to you. I never had an idea of\r\nwhat death was, or of what the human body was before, and am very far\r\nfrom knowing now. I am always thankful for having known you. I try to go\r\non to the end as I was. I hope you will do so too; it is best. I hope\r\nthat you may continue many years, and that you may do endless kindnesses\r\nto others. Will you cast a look sometimes on my old friends, Miss Knight\r\nand Mrs. [T. H.] Green, and my two young friends, F. and J.? It would\r\nplease me if you could say a word to them from time to time. But perhaps\r\nit is rather drivelling to try and make things permanent which are\r\nalready passing away. Ever yours affectionately, B. J.\" He thought that\r\nhe was on the point of death, and in a will made at this time he\r\nbequeathed \"£2000 to Miss Nightingale for certain purposes.\" It was the\r\nsum which he had meant to contribute to the \"Nightingale Professorship\r\nof Statistics.\" He rallied, however, and begged her to do as she had\r\noffered, and come over from Claydon to see him. \"I am delighted to\r\nhear,\" he wrote (Nov. 18), \"that you will do me the honour to come to\r\nBalliol to see me. Acland will send his carriage for you to the station.\r\nIt will be a great event for me to have a visit from you.\" Mr. Jowett\r\nwas spared for nearly two years, and he still came from time to time to\r\nsee her. \"I want to hold fast to you, dear friend,\" he wrote (May 26,\r\n1892), \"as I go down the hill. You and I are agreed that the last years\r\nof life are in a sense the best, and that the most may be made of them\r\neven at a time when health and strength may seem to be failing.\" In\r\nAugust 1893 Mr. Jowett was again very ill. He dictated a letter to Miss\r\nNightingale, commending some of his friends to her once more. He rallied\r\na little and came up to London to stay with Mr. and Mrs. Lewis\r\nCampbell. On September 18 he dictated his last letter to Miss\r\nNightingale: \"We called upon you yesterday in South Street, but finding\r\nno one at home supposed you had migrated to Claydon. Fare you well! How\r\ngreatly am I indebted to you for all your affection. How large a part\r\nhas your life been of my life. There is only time I think for a few\r\nwords.\" On October 1 he died at the house of Mr. Justice Wright in\r\nHampshire, to which he had gone a few days before. \"Do you know,\" wrote\r\nMiss Nightingale to Mrs. Clough (Nov. 7), \"that he sometimes felt glad\r\nin the society of 'Clough' during his last illness? He was in London at\r\nthe house of those dear Lewis Campbells for doctoring and nursing from\r\nSeptember 16 to 23rd. He was lying in the way he liked--silent, with\r\nMr. Lewis Campbell sitting beside him--when suddenly he opened his eyes\r\nand said, 'Oh, is it you? I thought it was Clough.'\" Pinned to Miss\r\nNightingale's letter, there is one which Mr. Jowett had written,\r\nthirty-two years before, to Mrs. Clough on the death of his friend, her\r\nhusband. In it he had said: \"I loved him and think of him daily. I\r\nshould like to have the memory of him, and also of Miss Nightingale,\r\npresent with me in death, as of the two persons whose example I value\r\nmost, as having 'walked by faith.'\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale had other bereavements at this time. \"I have lost,\" she\r\nwrote, \"the three nearest to me in twelve months\" (1893-94). In February\r\n1894, Sir Harry Verney died, and she felt the loss of \"his courage, his\r\ncourtesy, his kindness.\" In August, her cousin, Mr. Shore Smith,\r\ndied--\"her boy\" of the old days, whom throughout his life she had\r\nregarded with something of a mother's love; nor had she ever forgotten\r\nthe fond and dutiful affection which he had shown towards her own\r\nmother. Miss Nightingale felt the three losses deeply, but a note of\r\nserenity marked her old age. \"This is a sad birthday, dearest,\" she\r\nwrote a little later; \"but let me send a few roses to say what words\r\ncannot say. There is so much to live for. I have lost much in failures\r\nand disappointment, as well as in grief; but, do you know, life is more\r\nprecious to me now in my old age.\" The place left vacant by Mr. Jowett's\r\ndeath was in some respects filled henceforth by the Rev. Thory Gage\r\nGardiner, who from time to time administered the Sacrament to Miss\r\nNightingale in her room, and in whose work in South London she came to\r\ntake a lively interest.\r\n\r\nThe Professorship which Mr. Jowett and Miss Nightingale were to have\r\nfounded was never realized. Miss Nightingale had laid the scheme aside\r\nat the end of 1891--\"with a sore heart,\" she said, for it had been \"an\r\nobject of a lifetime.\" Mr. Jowett, knowing that she had abandoned the\r\nscheme, had omitted his bequest in a new will made during his last\r\nillness. But when three years later she in turn came to make her will\r\nshe still had the scheme in mind. It was a trust, she used to say,\r\ncommitted to her by M. Quetelet and Dr. Farr, and it was connected with\r\nmemories of Mr. Jowett. She gave accordingly \"to Francis Galton £2000\r\nfor certain purposes,\" and declared that \"the same shall be paid in\r\npriority to all other bequests given by her Will for charitable and\r\nother purposes.\" Her hope was that the £2000 would suffice for some\r\n_educational_ work in the use of Statistics, but Mr. Galton differed,\r\nand in the following year she revoked the bequest by Codicil. A\r\npencilled note found among her Papers gives the reason: \"I recall or\r\nrevoke the legacy of £2000 to Mr. Francis Galton because he does not\r\nthink it sufficient for the purpose I wished and proposes a small\r\nEndowment for _Research_, which I believe will only end in endowing some\r\nbacillus or microbe, and I do not wish that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's life, said Mr. Jowett, had been a large part of his.\r\nThat his life had also been a large part of hers, this Memoir will have\r\nshown. Few men or women had known him so well, and into the inscription\r\nwhich she sent with her flowers she distilled her memories: \"In loving\r\nremembrance of Professor Jowett, the Genius of Friendship, above all the\r\nFriend of God.\" Among the many letters which she received about his\r\ndeath none touched or interested her so much as those of Lord\r\nLansdowne:--\r\n\r\n     SIMLA, _October_ 11. Our dear old friend is, as far as his bodily\r\n     presence in our midst is concerned, lost to us. It is a real sorrow\r\n     to me. I had no more constant friend, and I cannot express the\r\n     gratitude with which I look back to his unfailing interest in all\r\n     that befell me and to his help and guidance at times when they were\r\n     most needed. His saying that he meant to get better \"because he had\r\n     yet so much to do\" is touching and characteristic. He was one who\r\n     would never have sate down and said that his task was done, or that\r\n     he was entitled to rest from toil for the remainder of his days. It\r\n     would, however, be very far from the truth to think that his work was\r\n     at an end because he is no longer here to carry it on with his own\r\n     hands.\r\n\r\n     SIMLA, _October_ 25. Of all the true and appreciative words which\r\n     you have written of him, none seem to me truer than those in which\r\n     you speak almost impatiently of the shallow fools who thought that\r\n     he had \"no religion.\" His religion always seemed to me nearer to\r\n     that which _The_ Master taught his followers than that of any other\r\n     man or woman whom I have met, and I doubt whether any one of our\r\n     time has done so much to spread true religion and Christianity in\r\n     the best sense of the word.\r\n\r\nAll this was precisely and profoundly what Miss Nightingale felt about\r\nher friend. Of all men whom she had known, none seemed to her to have\r\nled a Christian life more consistently than Mr. Jowett. In her thoughts\r\nabout him she had only one regret. It was that their friendship had\r\nnever resulted in any formal re-statement of religious doctrine. She had\r\nnot been able to put into any such form as satisfied him the scheme of\r\nTheodicy which they had discussed during thirty years, and he had\r\ndevoted too much time, she thought, to criticism and too little to\r\nreconstruction. But in religious practice, how rich was his legacy--both\r\nin precept and in example! In letters of his later years, no thought had\r\nbeen more often expressed by Mr. Jowett than that of Browning's _Rabbi\r\nBen Ezra_--a poem which he was constantly recommending to Miss\r\nNightingale. And there was another poem which he sent her: _The Song\r\nCelestial_, translated from the Mahâbhârata by Sir Edwin Arnold. \"I\r\nthink,\" he wrote (Nov. 6, 1886), \"it expresses some of the deepest\r\nthoughts of the human heart.\" These two poems which Miss Nightingale\r\nread, marked, and learnt, were to set the note of her last years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                              OLD AGE--DEATH\r\n\r\n                                (1894-1910)\r\n\r\n\r\n     The truer, the safer, the better years of life are the later ones.\r\n     We must find new ways of using them, doing not so much, but in a\r\n     better manner--economising because economy has become necessary,\r\n     for bodily strength obviously grows less: that is the will of God\r\n     and cannot be escaped or denied.--BENJAMIN JOWETT (_Letter to Miss\r\n     Nightingale_, Dec. 30, 1887).\r\n\r\n                              Let fruits of labour go,\r\n               Renouncing hope for Me, with lowliest heart,\r\n               So shalt thou come; for tho' to know is more\r\n               Than diligence, yet worship better is\r\n               Than knowing, and renouncing better still.\r\n               Near to renunciation--very near--\r\n               Dwelleth Eternal Peace.\r\n                                 SIR EDWIN ARNOLD: _The Song Celestial_.\r\n\r\nIt was in the spirit of Rabbi Ben Ezra that Miss Nightingale faced old\r\nage, and for a few years after she had passed her 75th birthday she was\r\nable to enjoy \"the last of life\" with full zest. Something of her former\r\nvigour was lost, but something of tenderness and acquiescence was\r\ngained. Then her powers gradually failed; she was still in this world,\r\nbut hardly any longer of it. The time for renunciation was come. There\r\nwere several years of pensive evening; and then, the end--or, as Miss\r\nNightingale believed with passionate intensity, the beginning of new\r\nwork in another world. In her later years, a young cousin, in speaking\r\nto her of the death of a relation whom they both loved, said that now at\r\nany rate he was at rest and in peace. Miss Nightingale, who had been\r\nlying back on her pillows, sat up on the instant and said with full fire\r\nand vigour, \"Oh _no_, I am _sure_ it is an immense activity.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's fervour in preaching the gospel that a man's latter\r\nyears should be his best appears in a series of letters which touch\r\nsuccessively on three of the main interests of her life. The first is to\r\nthe cousin who now for thirty-five years had been her right-hand man in\r\nall that concerned the Nightingale School; the second is to a politician\r\nwith whose aspirations for a new era in India she had sympathized; and\r\nthe third, to her old comrades in the British Army:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Henry Bonham Carter._) 10 SOUTH STREET, _March_ 4 [1894]. MY\r\n     DEAR HARRY--F. N. did not know or did not remember--more abominable\r\n     me!--that your birthday, a day we must all bless--was on Feb. 15.\r\n     And don't say \"alas!\" when you say \"it completes my 67th year.\"\r\n     Your sun is still in the meridian, thank God! Mr. Jowett always\r\n     said that the last years of life were and ought to be the best--and\r\n     of himself he said (tho' he had, I fear, plenty of suffering in the\r\n     last two years, and some ingratitude among those whom he had really\r\n     created), that these years were his happiest--his energy never\r\n     flagged. Sir Harry, an extraordinarily different man, has often\r\n     told me that the last two or three were the happiest. And his\r\n     energy, fitful as it always was, never flagged till the very last\r\n     week of his life. Sidney Herbert worked till his last fortnight.\r\n     And Mr. Gladstone--for this is like his death[246]--will be\r\n     lamented not because he worked at Home Rule to his last moment, but\r\n     because to his last moment he maintained the House of Commons at\r\n     what it was in the years I so well remember, its palmy days under\r\n     the School of Sir Robert Peel, of whom he is the last. Now, haven't\r\n     we cause to rejoice in your life ever more and more every year, and\r\n     to thank you more and more, and to sing not the Dies Iræ but the Te\r\n     Deum for your life. And a great many more besides us. Hoot, hoot,\r\n     laddie! you are one of those who \"open the Kingdom of heaven\"--that\r\n     which is \"within\" and here--\"to all believers\"; and _not_ one of\r\n     those who leap from a pinnacle of the temple knowing nothing, but\r\n     just thinking that the \"angels will bear them up\"--like some I\r\n     could name but refrain. And one at least of the \"angels\" is always\r\n     a vulgar wretch. And the real \"angels\" who are working hard, and in\r\n     detail entirely repudiate the \"bearing up\" of the leaper from the\r\n     pinnacle.... Believe me, ever yours gratefully and affectionately,\r\n     F. N.\r\n\r\n     (_To Sir William Wedderburn._) 10 SOUTH STREET, _August_ 13\r\n     [1896].... You have no business to be low-spirited about the\r\n     future. There is Providence still. It is 40 years this month since\r\n     I came back from the Crimea. See how poor I have been helped,\r\n     though I have lost all my friends among Ministers. When I am\r\n     low-spirited I read about the Duke of Wellington in the Battle of\r\n     Waterloo or the Peninsular War. And I see how he held on. Alone he\r\n     did it. And what was the end? He saved Europe. So it will be with\r\n     you. You will save India.\r\n\r\n  [246] He had resigned the Prime Ministership on March 3, and made his\r\n        last speech in the House of Commons on March 1. He was then 85.\r\n\r\n     (_To the Crimean Veterans._) _October_ 25 [1897]. MY DEAR OLD\r\n     COMRADES--I think of you on Balaclava Day and many days besides. In\r\n     peace as in war, I wish you the best wish: Quit ye like men! God,\r\n     from whom the soldiers take their orders, has as much work for us to\r\n     do for Him in peace as in war--thank His Love and Wisdom!--and to the\r\n     last years of our lives which ought to be the best years of our lives.\r\n     Never say \"_poor_ lives.\" Life is a splendid gift if we will but\r\n     let Him make it so, here and hereafter, for Himself. God bless you\r\n     all.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before the date of her letter to the Crimean veterans, she\r\nhad thanked God in her meditations for all he had given her--\"work,\r\nconstant work, work with Sidney Herbert, work with Lord Lawrence, and\r\nnever out of work still.\" \"I am soaked in work,\" she wrote to Sir\r\nDouglas Galton (Jan. 1897). \"You see,\" she said to Mr. Bonham Carter\r\n(Sept. 1895), \"I have my hands full, and am not idle, though people\r\nnaturally think that I have gone to sleep or am dead.\" Once or twice,\r\nher death had been reported. On another occasion, a paragraph went the\r\nround of the religious press stating that Miss Nightingale having\r\ncontracted a spinal complaint from her long hours of standing in the\r\nCrimea, had \"now for some years been an in-patient at St. Thomas's\r\nHospital.\" The paragraph brought a sheaf of letters from persons with\r\n\"sure remedies\" for spinal disease, from faith-healers, from mothers who\r\nhad daughters similarly affected; and to the Hospital, many flowers and\r\nletters of consolation. \"They know nothing,\" she wrote to Mr. Bonham\r\nCarter (July 6, 1897), \"of what a press my life is, and often a hopeless\r\npress but for you.\" It was a busy life, and, until near its end, it was\r\nless subject to ill-health than in earlier years. She had outgrown the\r\nweakness of heart and nerves which had often been distressing in middle\r\nlife, and though she still kept to her room, the impression which she\r\nnow made upon all who saw her was of robust and vigorous old age.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nAll the active interests of her life still occupied her. She interested\r\nherself closely in the progress of sanitary reform in India, and it was\r\nnot till 1906 that her secretary had to inform the India Office that\r\nSanitary Papers could no longer usefully be forwarded to her. Lord\r\nElgin, who succeeded Lord Lansdowne as Viceroy in 1894, had sent his\r\nprivate secretary, Sir Henry Babington Smith, to call upon her, and\r\nthrough him she had still corresponded with the Governor-General. Her\r\ndays of vigorous campaigning were over; she became more reconciled, as\r\nshe grew older, to those \"periods of Indian cosmogony\" of which Lord\r\nSalisbury, in the years of her impatience, had reminded her. She\r\nrealized more fully than before that in India the progress of sanitary\r\neducation must be slow. In 1898 she received the Aga Khan. \"A most\r\ninteresting man,\" she said in her note of the interview; \"but you could\r\nnever teach him sanitation. I never understood before how really\r\nimpossible it is for an Eastern to care for material things. I told him\r\nas well as I could all the differences both in town and in country\r\nduring my life. Do you think you are improving? he asked. By improving\r\nhe meant Believing more in God. To him sanitation is unreal and\r\nsuperstitious; religion, spirituality, is the only real thing.\" And,\r\nbesides, Miss Nightingale had now to accept limitations in what she\r\ncould any longer hope to effect. These limitations, and the work within\r\nthem which she still was able to do, are touched upon in a piece from\r\nher pen in 1896.[247] \"I am painfully aware how difficult, how almost\r\nimpossible, it is for any one at a great distance to do anything to help\r\nforward a movement requiring unremitting labour and supervision on the\r\nspot. But it is my privilege to meet in England from time to time Indian\r\nfriends who are heartily desirous of obtaining for their poorer\r\nfellow-countrymen the benefits which, through sanitary science, are\r\ngradually being extended to the masses here, both in town and country,\r\nand which are doing so much to promote their health and happiness. So I\r\nnever lose an opportunity of urging a practical beginning, however\r\nsmall, for it is wonderful how often in such matters the mustard-seed\r\ngerminates and roots itself.\" And she went on to describe the steps\r\nwhich her friend Mr. Malabari was taking to promote sanitary education,\r\nand even to institute Health Missionaries, in selected districts of\r\nRural India. The Government of India was co-operating to some extent in\r\nsuch work. In a Paper written in 1894[248] she tendered \"cordial\r\nacknowledgments to Lord Cross, Lord Kimberley, and Mr. Fowler, the\r\nsuccessive Secretaries of State for India, also to Lord Lansdowne and\r\nLord Elgin, the Viceroys, for the personal interest they have shown\" in\r\nthe matter of Village Sanitation. She especially commended the practical\r\nand helpful spirit shown in the Government of India's Dispatch of March\r\n1895 instituting \"Village Sanitary Inspection Books.\"\r\n\r\n  [247] Bibliography A, No. 138.\r\n\r\n  [248] Bibliography A, No. 135.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nIn the Army, too, Miss Nightingale continued to take a lively interest,\r\nand Sir Douglas Galton was still within--not always instant--call to\r\ngive her information or advice:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Sir Douglas Galton._) 10 SOUTH STREET, _Nov._\r\n     24 [1895]. Oh you Turk, oh you rascal, Sir Douglas, not to tell me\r\n     that you were in London, not to reward me for my good resolution in\r\n     not troubling you. I would have asked but few questions, but these\r\n     called for haste. (i.) Most important: How the troops for Kumassi\r\n     are to be supplied with water, day and night, fit to drink? Spirit\r\n     ration only as medicine? Are they to have salt pork and beef? Then\r\n     about their shoes, stockings, and boots? Are these things now\r\n     recognized at Head Quarters? Probably I am disquieting myself in\r\n     vain. Lord Lansdowne is so overwhelmed with amateur schemes for W.\r\n     O. reform--not that I am in that line of business now at all; but I\r\n     do not like to write to him just now. (ii.) Barracks at\r\n     Newcastle-on-Tyne, depot where 5th Fusiliers are quartered, said to\r\n     be in an awful state of bad drainage: not denied, but remedy\r\n     \"would cost too much.\" I know nothing of it personally. \"Ladies\r\n     Sanitary Association\" dying to interfere. Sir Thomas Crawford dead,\r\n     or I should have asked _his_ advice. (iii.) We have another Nurse\r\n     (a Sister of St. Thomas's) going out to India to join the Army\r\n     Nursing Staff. Three are going out in three ships--they don't know\r\n     where--each goes alone. (The I.O. sends them out like the famous\r\n     _pair_ of Painted Marmots who came over in _three_ ships, on the\r\n     crust of a twopenny loaf which served them for provisions during\r\n     the voyage.) Mine asks me for an Army Medical Book. Don't\r\n     misunderstand: the Nurses must not know anything about anything, to\r\n     be looked well on by the Doctors, whose treatment is, I believe,\r\n     what it was 40 years ago. But if there is a book which could put\r\n     her up to things, not excepting the terrible increase of the\r\n     vicious disease, do recommend it me if you can.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 came the reluctant retirement of the Duke of Cambridge from the\r\npost of Commander-in-Chief which he had held for nearly fifty years, and\r\nSir Douglas suggested to Miss Nightingale that the old soldier might be\r\npleased by a letter from her. \"I should never have thought that myself,\"\r\nshe said; but she had a soft place in her heart for the Duke, as we have\r\nseen,[249] and she took kindly to the suggestion. She sent a sympathetic\r\nletter in which, as an old servant of the soldiers herself, she ventured\r\nto thank the Duke for his many services to the British Army. \"I have had\r\nsuch a very nice answer,\" she told Sir Douglas. The terms in which the\r\nDuke replied (Oct. 1) show that Miss Nightingale's kindly compliments\r\nhad brought some balm to him in his \"great grief and sorrow.\"\r\n\r\n  [249] Vol. I. p. 385.\r\n\r\nOne of Miss Nightingale's latest interventions in administrative affairs\r\nwas an urgent plea for improvement in the barracks at Hong-Kong, about\r\nwhich she had received private information in connection with the\r\noutbreak of bubonic plague in 1896. She prepared a careful summary of\r\nthe case, and through Sir Douglas Galton made representations both to\r\nthe War Office (Sir Evelyn Wood) and to the Colonial Office\r\n(Mr. Chamberlain). Sir Evelyn Wood, I feel sure, must at any rate have\r\nlistened attentively to what she had to say. In 1898 he gave an\r\nappointment to a godson of hers[250] and told her with what pleasure he\r\nhad done so \"as a patient of yours in 1856.\" As for the Colonial Office,\r\nshe noted a wise saw which some one told her: \"If you get a private\r\nreply, the thing is done; if an official reply, all is up.\" Her reply\r\nwas official, but nevertheless something was done; though not, I think,\r\nall that she wanted. Another matter which much occupied Miss\r\nNightingale's mind at this time was the effect of the repeal of the\r\nContagious Diseases Act, especially in connection with India. In 1896-97\r\na Departmental Committee was appointed to report upon the facts, and\r\nthere was much discussion. Miss Nightingale was besieged by both sides\r\nfor her opinion. She had found reason in the facts for some modification\r\nof her former opinions.[251] She was still opposed to the complete\r\nreintroduction of the old system, but she thought, on close examination\r\nof the facts, that the balance of advantage, moral and physical, lay\r\nwith some amount of sanitary precaution. She signed, with a\r\nreservation,[252] a memorial promoted by Princess Christian, Lady Jeune,\r\nand others, \"expressing our anxious hope that effectual measures will be\r\ntaken to check the spread of contagious diseases among our soldiers,\r\nespecially in India.\" There was much abuse of Miss Nightingale, and some\r\npraying over her for such \"backsliding.\" It was in connection with this\r\nmatter that she wrote a characteristic comment upon one of her friends:\r\n\"She does not want to hear facts; she wants to be enthusiastic.\"\r\n\r\n  [250] In later years Miss Nightingale was not quite so strict as\r\n        formerly (see above, p. 73) in abstaining from asking such favours.\r\n\r\n  [251] See above, p. 75.\r\n\r\n  [252] Miss Nightingale's signature was \"subject to the addition of a\r\n        request that an independent inquiry be at the same time set on foot\r\n        at the several stations in India as recommended by the\r\n        Governor-General in Council on Nov. 4, 1896.\"\r\n\r\nStudy of the facts, forethought, good administration: these were the\r\nthings which constantly occupied Miss Nightingale's mind in relation to\r\nmilitary, as to other, affairs. They were the things which had been\r\nindelibly impressed upon her by the Crimean War. In the year of the\r\nDiamond Jubilee, the enterprising Mr. Kiralfy bethought himself of a\r\nVictorian Era Exhibition, in which one section should be devoted to\r\nNursing. Great ladies took up the idea, and Miss Nightingale was\r\nbesieged from many quarters to let herself be \"represented\" by\r\nphotographs, busts, autographs, and \"relics of the Crimean War.\" Miss\r\nNightingale at the first attack was in her most withering vein. \"Oh the\r\nabsurdity of people,\" she wrote, \"and the vulgarity! The 'relics,' the\r\n'representations' of the Crimean War! What are they? They are, first,\r\nthe tremendous lessons we have had to learn from its tremendous blunders\r\nand ignorances. And next they are Trained Nurses and the progress of\r\nHygiene. These are the 'representations' of the Crimean War. And I will\r\nnot give my foolish Portrait (which I have not got) or anything else as\r\n'relics' of the Crimea. It is too ridiculous. You don't judge even of\r\nthe victuals inside a public-house by the sign outside. I won't be made\r\na _sign_ at an Exhibition. Think of Sidney Herbert's splendid Royal\r\nCommissions which struck the keynote of progress in the British Army!\r\nThink of the unwearied toil of the Sanitarians! And you ask me for the\r\nphotograph of a rat! and at the moment too when there is the Plague at\r\nBombay!\" But having delivered her mind in some letters to this effect,\r\nMiss Nightingale let her heart be persuaded. Lady Wantage, whom she held\r\nin affectionate admiration, climbed the stairs in South Street to press\r\nthe suit in person, and Miss Nightingale surrendered. \"Lady Wantage was\r\nso charming,\" she wrote, half-ashamed of the surrender, \"and she\r\nwouldn't 'take' when I went off upon Royal Commissions _et id genus\r\nomne_, and she stuck to her point and she was so gracious and she is\r\nsuch a very good woman.\" So the \"bust of Florence Nightingale\" was lent,\r\nand her old \"Crimean carriage,\" brought down from a loft in the country,\r\nwas patched up to serve as a \"relic.\" A distinguished writer (but he was\r\na humorist) has averred that he once saw an Italian organ-grinder on his\r\nknees before a shop-window in St. Martin's Lane, having taken a\r\ndentist's showcase for relics of the saints. That was perhaps pushing\r\nthings a little far; but \"hope in the hem of the garment\" is deeply\r\nrooted in men's hearts. \"We want something to love,\" said one of Miss\r\nNightingale's friends in supporting Lady Wantage's petition, \"and one\r\ncannot love Royal Commissions.\" The Crimean relic served. At the\r\nExhibition an old soldier was seen to go up to the carriage and kiss it.\r\nThe bust was also bedecked. \"Now I must ask you,\" wrote Miss Nightingale\r\nto her cousin Louis (Oct. 16, 1897), when the Exhibition was to be\r\nclosed, \"about my bust. (Here I stop to utter a great many bad words,\r\nnot fit to put on paper. I also utter a pious wish that the bust may be\r\nsmashed.) I should not have remembered it, but that I am told somebody\r\ncame every day to dress it with fresh flowers. I utter a pious wish that\r\nthat person may be saved. You (for I know not what sins), it appears,\r\nare my 'man of business.' What _is_ to be done about that bust?\" Miss\r\nNightingale's private meditations were the more earnest for her\r\ncompliance in what she regarded as a mere triviality. The Exhibition was\r\nto her an occasion for giving thanks to God. \"How inefficient I was in\r\nthe Crimea! Yet He has raised up Trained Nursing from it!\"\r\n\r\nMemories of the Crimea were much in Miss Nightingale's mind during these\r\nyears. On Waterloo Day, 1898, she made an interesting note:--\r\n\r\n     What an administrator was the Duke! He chose the ground for the\r\n     battle--he, not the enemy. By his constructive arrangements, having\r\n     forced them to accept the ground _he_ chose, he, who had no staff\r\n     fit to help him, supervised everything himself. He made each Corps\r\n     lie down on the ground he had chosen for it the next day; the\r\n     ammunition each would require was conveyed to it under _his own_\r\n     orders (how many a battle has been lost from want of ammunition!);\r\n     he provided for every possible contingency. Nothing was neglected,\r\n     nothing lost, nothing failed. And so he delivered Europe from the\r\n     greatest military genius the world has seen. How different was the\r\n     Duke from Lord Raglan, excepting that both were honourable\r\n     gentlemen! Lord Raglan was told in a letter by a chance Doctor, a\r\n     volunteer, a civilian, a man whom nobody had ever heard of, that if\r\n     the men were not better hutted, better fed, better clothed, in a\r\n     few weeks he would have no army at all. Lord Raglan rode down at\r\n     once alone with the exception of a single Orderly, and got off his\r\n     horse and went into his informant's tent and said, \"You know I\r\n     could try you by Court Martial for this letter.\" He answered, \"My\r\n     Lord, that is just what I want. Then the truth will come out. What\r\n     signifies what becomes of me? But will you ride round first alone\r\n     just as you are now at once and see whether what I have said is\r\n     true?\" Lord Raglan did so, and found that it was within the truth.\r\n     And so the Army was saved. The men were dying of scurvy from salt\r\n     meat; but the shores of the Euxine were crowded with cattle.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of war in South Africa led her thoughts to another interest\r\nwhich had much occupied her at Scutari--the better employment of the\r\nsoldier in peace:--\r\n\r\n     \"London is full,\" she noted (October 1899), \"of rumours of war with\r\n     the Boers. I cannot say these rumours are frightful in my ears. Few\r\n     men and fewer women have seen so much of the horrors of war as I\r\n     have. Yet I cannot say that war seems to me an unmitigated evil.\r\n     The soldier in war is a _man_: devoted to his duty, giving his life\r\n     for his comrade, his country, his God. I cannot bear to say:\r\n     Compare him with the soldier in peace in barracks; for you will\r\n     say, Then would you always have war? Well, I have nothing to do\r\n     with the making of war or peace. I can only say that you must see\r\n     the man in war to know what he is capable of. If you drive past a\r\n     barrack, you will see two heads idling and lolling out of every\r\n     window. And the only creature who is doing anything is the dog who\r\n     is carrying victuals to his wife who has puppies. And the moral is:\r\n     Provide the soldier with active employment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nShe was unable to take any active part in connection with sending out\r\nnurses to South Africa; though many inquiries were addressed to her, and\r\nmany nurses wrote to her from the scene of war. To the \"Scottish\r\nHospital in South Africa,\" she contributed £100--a gift which was partly\r\ninspired by affection for her \"grateful and loving child,\" Miss Spencer,\r\nmatron of the Edinburgh Infirmary, who was much interested in the\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's interest in the work of her old pupils all over the\r\ncountry, in the education of her Probationers at St. Thomas's, and in\r\nthe affairs of the nursing world in general, was unabated during the\r\nclosing years of the century. The \"Nurses' Battle\" about registration\r\nwas still active, and from time to time she was appealed to for aid. In\r\n1895 certain overtures were made. \"Shall I royally discard it,\" she\r\nasked, \"or give them a buster?\" She chose the latter course. A little\r\nlater, one of her allies was thought to be weakening. \"I did my\r\n'spiriting,'\" she reported, \"with that gentleness for which I am so\r\nremarkable! He gives in. He is a very striking man, and of great\r\npresence of mind; masterful too, but he is staggered by Princesses.\" She\r\nwas hard at work, too, with advising on appointments. There was one part\r\nof the world, however--Buenos Ayres--of which Miss Nightingale began to\r\nwash her hands. \"Of the last party, all were married within a year; what\r\nis the use of sending out any more?\" At home there were \"four successors\r\nwanted,\" she wrote (1896), \"and four staffs howling.\" A matron in a\r\ncountry hospital was about to resign: \"I had two letters and four\r\ntelegrams from her on Tuesday and other days in proportion.\" The volume\r\nof her nursing correspondence during 1896-97 is, indeed, as great as at\r\nany previous time, and she still received regular visits from matrons,\r\nsisters, and nurses. \"After looking over a mass of Sisters' Records,\r\nProbationers' examination-papers, case-books, and diaries, and having\r\nhad the pleasure of many afternoons with Probationers and\r\nex-Probationers,\" she found \"much cause for thankfulness\" in her School;\r\nbut \"as we are always trying to make progress,\" she went on to propose\r\nto her Council a series of detailed suggestions for reform. For some\r\nyears, too, she was much occupied in advising Lord and Lady Monteagle in\r\na matter which they were promoting--the training of nurses for Irish\r\nWorkhouses. Her affectionate concern in her nursing friends was\r\nconstant. In the year of the Jubilee (1897) Queen Victoria invited her\r\nto come in a bath-chair to the forecourt of Buckingham Palace to witness\r\nthe procession. She was unable to leave her room, but she remembered the\r\nnurses and purchased a number of seats for distribution among them. She\r\nwas deeply interested in a nurse who volunteered for plague-service in\r\nIndia: \"The deepest, quietest, most striking person I have seen from our\r\npresent staff, and so pretty. Not enthusiastic except in the good old\r\noriginal sense: God in us. She is firmly and cautiously determined to go\r\nto the Plague.\" After a series of interviews with nurses and letters\r\nfrom them (1898), Miss Nightingale noted some impressions of types. She\r\nvalued efficiency, but she deplored a tendency which she detected to\r\nsubstitute professionalism for heart. Who are the \"ministering angels\"?\r\nshe asked. \"The Angels are _not_ they who go about scattering flowers:\r\nany naughty child would like to do that, even any rascal. The Angels are\r\nthey who, like Nurse or Ward-maid or Scavenger, do disgusting work,\r\nremoving injury to health or obstacles to recovery, emptying slops,\r\nwashing patients, etc., for all of which they receive no thanks. These\r\nare the Angels. They speak kind words too, and give sympathy. The drabby\r\nNurse, crying as if her heart would break, with apron over her head,\r\nbecause a poor little peevish thing who has never given her anything but\r\ntrouble is dead--is an Angel; while the nurse who coolly walks down a\r\nWard noting how many children are dead who were alive when she last made\r\nher round, is by no means an Angel.\"\r\n\r\nIn such thoughts Miss Nightingale had a constant sympathizer in the\r\nGrand Duchess of Baden, who wrote to her year by year, in terms of warm\r\naffection, reporting progress in German nursing--reports which told of\r\nprofessional improvement, but also, as the Grand Duchess thought, of\r\nsome lack of high ideal. The Empress Frederick, too, continued to see\r\nMiss Nightingale from year to year, and their talk was very sympathetic.\r\nOf her allies at home, Mr. Bonham Carter was helpful, not only in the\r\nconduct of the Nightingale School but in the management of her private\r\naffairs. Mr. Rathbone retained to the last his devotion to her as the\r\nfounder of modern nursing. \"To have been allowed,\" he wrote (Dec. 27,\r\n1897), \"to work with your inspiration and wise counsels for more than 35\r\nyears as one of your agents in your great work is a thing I am deeply\r\ngrateful for. I remain while life lasts your devoted friend, and in\r\neffort at least your faithful servant.\" \"From the confinement of your\r\nroom,\" he added, \"you have done more to spread reform than you could\r\nhave done with the most perfect health and strength.\" That was not the\r\nopinion of Miss Nightingale; she could only direct or advise; she had\r\nfor many years been forced to leave action to others. The sense of this\r\ndisability did not grow less, but as years passed, it was felt to be the\r\ncommon lot of the old. She was not well pleased with all that she saw,\r\nbut she was, of necessity and by discipline of character, less\r\nimpatient. She could now regard with affectionate tolerance a wedding in\r\nher family of nurses. To one \"child\" she sent a present \"With the very\r\nbest marriage wishes of F. N., though sorry to lose you. Come and see\r\nme.\" She even forgave an old friend whose marriage many years before she\r\nhad resented as \"desertion.\" She saw much around her to criticize, but\r\nshe was content to uphold her own ideals and her criticisms became less\r\ncensorious. \"Remember,\" she said to herself in her meditations, \"God is\r\nnot my Private Secretary.\" As old friends disappeared, she looked the\r\nmore earnestly to the younger generation. Sir Robert Rawlinson, who for\r\nmore than forty years had corresponded with her on sanitary affairs,\r\ndied in 1898; Sir Douglas Galton, in 1899; Mr. Rathbone, in 1902.[253]\r\nShe was anxious that Sir Douglas Galton's services should be rightly\r\nappreciated in the press, and took some measures to that end. \"The man\r\nwhom we have lost,\" she wrote privately (March 12, 1899), \"Sir Douglas\r\nGalton, was the first Royal Engineer who put any _sanitary_ work into R.\r\nEngineering. The head of these men at the War Office, the R. Engineers,\r\nhimself said to me: 'our business is to make roads and to build\r\nbridges--we have nothing to do with health and that kind of Doctor's\r\nwork,' or words to that effect. Sir D. G. opened his own ears and his\r\nheart and his mind, and put all his powers into saving life while\r\nworking in his profession.\" \"One does feel,\" she had written on All\r\nSouls' Day, 1896, \"the passing away of so many who seemed essential to\r\nthe world. I have no one now to whom I could speak of those who are\r\ngone. But all the more I am eager to see successors. What is that\r\nverse--that the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the\r\nmanifestation of the sons (and daughters) of God. And I am thankful for\r\nthe many noble souls I have known.\"\r\n\r\n  [253] For Miss Nightingale's tribute to his memory, see above, p. 124.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nGradually Miss Nightingale's powers failed. For the last fifteen years\r\nof her life she seldom left her room in South Street. Her last visit to\r\nEmbley had been in August 1891. The property there was sold in 1896,\r\n\"and I don't like being turned out of Hampshire,\" she said. Her last\r\nvisit to Claydon was in 1894-95. To Lea Hurst, which had been let for 10\r\nyears in 1883, she never went after her mother's death, though she\r\nretained her interest in local affairs there to the end. Already in 1887\r\nshe had talked of herself as \"almost blind\"; and in 1895, in a note of\r\nsymptoms about which to ask her doctor, she had included \"want of\r\nmemory.\" The loss at first was only of dates and names, but after a few\r\nyears it became more general. Her eyesight, which had troubled her for\r\nsome time, now failed. The long series of pencilled meditations\r\nceased. In the later years of them though there was still much\r\nself-condemnation, there was more of peace and hope. \"November 3-4,\r\n1893. Thirty-nine years ago arrival at Scutari. The immense blessings I\r\nhave had--the longings of my heart accomplished--and now drawn to Thee\r\nby difficulties and disappointments.\" \"Homeward bound.\" \"I have entered\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\nOwing to her eyesight being the first among her powers to fail, there is\r\none exception to the general statement that the failure was gradual. Her\r\npower of writing failed all at once. Miss Nightingale's handwriting, of\r\nwhich a facsimile has already been given, was very characteristic:\r\nclear, bold, and careful. She was possessed with the idea of doing\r\neverything that she undertook as perfectly as pains could enable her. In\r\nher handwriting every letter is well formed, every word has its clear\r\nspace: paragraphs, insets, and intervals are arranged carefully to help\r\nthe reader to the sense; yet all is done with an air of freedom and\r\ndistinction. There is artistic feeling about the script; the distinctive\r\nformation of the _F_ in her signature may be instanced. Few persons, I\r\nimagine, have ever written so much as Miss Nightingale did with her own\r\nhand, and the writing never deteriorated. Some of her best friends and\r\nhelpers--Sidney Herbert, for instance, and Douglas Galton--wrote, when\r\nhurried, the worst hands; and she would often pencil, over their almost\r\nindecipherable scrawls, a fair copy of what she conjectured the words to\r\nbe. Many of her own letters were in pencil, for she wrote much in bed;\r\nbut she used a particular brand--procured by her friend Mr. Frederick,\r\nof the War Office--hard, and not easily delible, and her handwriting is\r\nas good in pencil as with the pen. There were some variations in its\r\nmanner. In middle life, as some one said of it, her writing \"galloped\r\nacross the page tossing its mane.\" In youth and in age, it was extremely\r\ncareful. The very latest examples which I have seen show only a slight\r\nquaver in the lines; the formation of the letters and the spacing are as\r\nexact as ever. Then the sight failed, and the writing almost ceased.\r\n\r\nFrom about 1901 or 1902 onwards she could neither read nor write except\r\nwith the greatest difficulty. There were no longer papers on the bed.\r\nThe hands were quiet. Her eyes rested on her friends with even more than\r\nthe old kindness, but not with the old penetrating clearness. In 1902\r\nMiss Nightingale was persuaded to accept the services of a companion,\r\nMiss Cochrane; who, on leaving to be married, was succeeded in 1904 by\r\nMiss Elizabeth Bosanquet. Some diplomacy was necessary, and at first it\r\nwas agreed that the post should be called that of \"lady housekeeper.\" In\r\nreality it was that of private secretary, with large initiative. Miss\r\nNightingale did not easily yield to her infirmities; she concealed them,\r\ntoo, so cleverly as sometimes to mislead visitors, who took a kindly\r\n\"yes, dear\" to express more intellectual apprehension and assent than\r\nreally lay behind it. Lord Kitchener, who paid her a visit, remarked to\r\nMiss Cochrane after the interview how closely Miss Nightingale in her\r\nold age followed what was going on; but she had known that Lord\r\nKitchener was coming and had prepared herself by questioning Miss\r\nCochrane fully and impressing on her own memory what her visitor had\r\nlately been doing. For some years she liked to feel that she was still\r\nin the movement of the world, and to have the daily newspaper read to\r\nher--thus submitting in old age to an exercise which had caused her much\r\nimpatient disgust in youth. Her _Notes on Nursing_, written nearly half\r\na century before, proved true in some respects of her own case, though\r\nnot in others. She was indifferent to some of her maxims, and in the\r\nlast years paid little attention to the gospel of the open window. But\r\nwhat she had observed in sickrooms about the tastes of others was\r\nrecognized as true by those in attendance upon her. So long as she could\r\nsee at all, she greatly loved to have flowers about her. Then, again,\r\nshe had written that what those like who are past the power of action\r\nthemselves is \"to hear of good practical action by others.\" And that was\r\nwhat she found in her old age. She liked to have biographies read to\r\nher, and essays which recounted or commended vigorous doing. She was\r\nnever tired of some pages in Mr. Roosevelt's _Strenuous Life_, and would\r\nsignify approval by rapping energetically on the table beside her. For\r\nseveral years her bodily strength was well maintained, and she suffered\r\nlittle, except from occasional rheumatism. She was rather a difficult\r\npatient, for she could not bring herself to believe that she needed\r\ncare. She did not take kindly to the introduction of a nurse. The ruling\r\npassion of her life was strong; and when the nurse had tucked her up for\r\nthe night, she would often reverse the parts, get out of bed and go into\r\nthe adjoining room to tuck up the nurse. She could not realize that her\r\nsecretary lived with her night and day; and when good-night was said,\r\nshe would reply, \"And now, my dear, how are you going home? do let me\r\nsend for a cab.\" Her voice still retained its quality. In extreme old\r\nage she used to recite Milton and Shelley and pieces of Italian and\r\nFrench in rich, full tones. Sometimes she would sing, still in a sweet\r\nand gay voice, a snatch of an Italian song. Her voice seemed, says one\r\nwho was much with her, to fill the room. \"One day,\" says a cousin, \"she\r\nwas objecting to being helped in dressing, and I was summoned from the\r\nbottom to the top of the house by splendid easy shouts.\" But there was\r\nonly occasional revolt. The abiding impression made upon all who served\r\nher was of an unfailing kindness and consideration.\r\n\r\nShe still received many visitors, in addition to her cousins and other\r\nkinsfolk. Among old friends, Miss Paulina Irby saw her the most\r\nfrequently. Sometimes the visit was from a stranger, to whom the\r\noccasion had almost an hieratic impressiveness. Miss Nightingale liked\r\nbest those visitors who had an abundant flow of vigorous talk. A pause\r\nin the conversation, which she might be expected to fill by starting a\r\nnew topic, was a strain to her. The visits which tired her least were\r\nthose of Matrons and nursing Sisters. She loved to hear of their work,\r\ntheir patients, and especially of suggestions they made for\r\nimprovements. One of her nursing friends paused in the talk to ask, \"But\r\nam I not tiring you?\" \"Oh, no,\" replied Miss Nightingale quickly, \"you\r\ngive me new life.\" To dictate any message on her own part was now beyond\r\nher. Of the messages sent to her, those which she longest retained the\r\npower of apprehending were from Crimean veterans.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nMemory, sight, and mental apprehension were rapidly failing when the\r\ncrowning honours of her life (as the world counts them) were conferred\r\nupon her. On November 28, 1907, King Edward wrote with \"much pleasure,\"\r\nto offer the Order of Merit \"in recognition of invaluable services to\r\nthe country and to humanity.\" A suitable reply was framed for her, and\r\non December 5, Sir Douglas Dawson, on the King's behalf, brought the\r\nOrder--then for the first time bestowed upon a woman--to South Street.\r\nMiss Nightingale understood that some kindness had been done to her, but\r\nhardly more. \"Too kind, too kind,\" she said. On March 16, 1908, the\r\nFreedom of the City of London was conferred upon her--hitherto conferred\r\non only one woman, Lady Burdett-Coutts. Miss Nightingale was able with\r\ngreat difficulty to sign from her bed her initials upon the City's roll\r\nof honour, but it is doubtful if she understood what she was being asked\r\nto sign. Perhaps it was better so. In the years of her strength she had\r\never a dread and a misgiving of the world's praises. In the days of her\r\nweakness, when power of work in this world had gone from her, she would\r\nhave regarded such honours, had she understood them, as coming too late.\r\nShe sought no glory-crown but the opportunity of doing New Work.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: Florence Nightingale\r\n                                   1907\r\n      from a water-colour drawing by Miss F. Alicia de Biden Footner]\r\n\r\nBut the prizes of the world may be of real value to others than those\r\nwho receive them. The signal honour conferred by the Crown upon Miss\r\nNightingale had the effect of calling fresh attention to her work and\r\nher example. Not, indeed, that these depended on adventitious aids to\r\nremembrance. To some men and women whose years are many it is fated that\r\nthey should outlive their fame. It was not so with Miss Nightingale. To\r\nher it was given to become in her lifetime a tradition and almost an\r\ninstitution; and the longer she lived, the greater, the more widespread\r\nwas her fame. Already on her 80th birthday (1900), Miss Nightingale had\r\nbeen the recipient of congratulations from Queens and Royal Highnesses,\r\nfrom schools and societies, and from nurses and nursing associations in\r\nall parts of the world. In the United States the name of Florence\r\nNightingale was even more widely known and loved than in Great Britain,\r\nand already in 1895 the American Ambassador (Mr. Bayard) had begged the\r\nhonour of an interview in order to tell her \"how much revered she is in\r\nthe United States.\" Perhaps the congratulations which might have pleased\r\nMiss Nightingale most--for she loved efficiency and had read _The Soul\r\nof a People_--were those which came from the Far East. From Tokio, on\r\nNovember 28, 1900, the Princess Imperial sent this letter: \"The\r\nCommittee of the Ladies of the Red Cross Society of Japan have the\r\npleasure of presenting to you their hearty congratulation on the\r\noccasion of your 80th birthday. That the Address reaches you late in\r\ntime is due to the great distance which separates your land from ours.\r\nBut far as our country is from yours, the example of your noble efforts,\r\nnow become historic, has not affected its inhabitants the less; for it\r\nis due to the impulse you have given to the humane work of nursing sick\r\nand wounded soldiers that the trained nurses of our Society, amounting\r\nto more than 1500 in number, as well as the members of our Committee,\r\nare applying themselves with eager zeal to the study and practice\r\nnecessary for complete efficiency in the hour of need. May your day\r\nstill be long that you may see the lasting influence of your work expand\r\nby its own virtue more and more in all the lands of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale had thus not been forgotten when the Sovereign bestowed\r\nthe Order of Merit; but the public honour set up a fresh cult of her\r\nname and work. Among the private congratulations sent to her, there was\r\none which if she were able to realize it, must have warmed the\r\nsoldier's heart in her. It was from Lord Roberts: \"Allow me to offer you\r\non behalf of Lady Roberts and myself sincerest congratulations on the\r\nhonour the King has been graciously pleased to confer upon you. It is\r\nindeed an honour conferred upon the Order of Merit; all the members of\r\nwhich must feel proud to have the name of Florence Nightingale added to\r\nthe list.\" The German Emperor, a little later, had a kindly thought. He\r\nhad been staying in the New Forest. \"His Majesty,\" wrote the German\r\nAmbassador (Dec. 10), \"having just brought to a close a most enjoyable\r\nstay in the beautiful neighbourhood of your old home near Romsey, has\r\ncommanded me to present you with some flowers as a token of his esteem.\"\r\nThe Mayor of her native city, Florence, sent congratulations; the\r\nPatriotic Society of Bologna made her a Companion of Honour. From all\r\nparts of Great Britain, from the Dominions, from the United States,\r\nmessages poured in. It was the story of \"The Popular Heroine\" repeated\r\nafter fifty years. The beggars and autograph-hunters were insistent; the\r\npoetasters, industrious. A great tribe of Florences, named after the\r\nheroine of the Crimea, sent messages. Flowers, needlework, illuminated\r\ncards were offered. Companies of girl-scouts called themselves \"The\r\nNightingales.\" There were \"Florence Nightingale Societies\" in America.\r\n\"Birthday letters to Florence Nightingale\" became a favourite\r\nschool-exercise. There were Crimean veterans who sent flowers or\r\nmessages recalling stirring times in which they had \"served with her,\"\r\nor who \"in old age and suffering\" desired to let Miss Florence\r\nNightingale know that they held her \"in lively and grateful\r\nremembrance.\"\r\n\r\nIn June 1907 there was an International Conference of Red Cross\r\nSocieties in London. Queen Alexandra sent a message referring to \"the\r\npioneer of the first Red Cross movement, Miss Florence Nightingale,\r\nwhose heroic efforts on behalf of suffering humanity will be recognized\r\nand admired by all ages as long as the world shall last.\" The\r\nConference, on the initiative of the Hungarian delegates, resolved\r\nunanimously that \"the great and incomparable name of Miss Florence\r\nNightingale, whose merits in the field of humanity are never to be\r\nforgotten, and who raised the care of the sick to the position of a\r\ncharitable art, imposes on the Eighth International Conference of Red\r\nCross Societies the noble duty of rendering homage to her merits by\r\nexpressing warmly its high veneration.\"\r\n\r\nIn May 1910 there was a large gathering in the Carnegie Hall in New\r\nYork, at which the public orator of America, Mr. Choate, delivered an\r\neulogium, \"testifying to the admiration of the entire American people\r\nfor Florence Nightingale's great record and noble life.\" The meeting,\r\nassembled in honour of the Jubilee of the Nightingale Training School,\r\nwas eloquent of the spread of her work, being representative of a\r\nthousand Nurse Training Schools in that country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VII\r\n\r\nThe subject of these friendly manifestations was already passing beyond\r\nreach of the hubbub. Her sight was gone. Her understanding had grown\r\nmore feeble. Her regular medical attendant was now Dr. May Thorne, whose\r\nskill and unremitting care did much to alleviate the last bed-ridden\r\nyears. Sir Thomas Barlow was called in for consultations periodically.\r\nVisitors had now been restricted to two or three a week. Visits were\r\nfound tiring, for she could not realize when the visitors were gone that\r\nthey were no longer in the room. Nor did she always remember which of\r\nher old friends were still alive. She did not realize that Sir Harry\r\nVerney was dead, she would sometimes ask for him, and wonder why he did\r\nnot come. Besides her own \"nieces,\" she still saw Sisters from St\r\nThomas's or other nursing friends, and occasionally was able by a\r\nquestion or two to show interest in what they said. One of the last to\r\nsee her outside the immediate circle was Miss Pringle, her dear friend,\r\nthe Pearl of an earlier chapter. \"She was sitting up by the fire in the\r\nfamiliar room, her mind evidently busy with happy thoughts, and once or\r\ntwice she spoke in a tone of satisfaction.\" This was in February 1910.\r\nShe could no longer follow sustained reading, but still liked to hear\r\nfamiliar hymns. A favourite, if one may judge by the frequency with\r\nwhich verses from it appear in her latest written meditations, was \"O\r\nLord, how happy should we be, If we could cast our care on Thee, If we\r\nfrom self could rest.\" Once, the expression of an aspiration; now\r\nperhaps, of attainment. The end came very peacefully. At the beginning\r\nof August, 1910, she had some ailment, but there seemed no cause for\r\nimmediate apprehension. On August 13, she fell asleep at noon, and did\r\nnot wake again. She died at about half-past two in the afternoon. She\r\nhad lived 90 years and three months.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe offer of burial in Westminster Abbey was declined by her relatives.\r\nShe had left directions that her funeral should be of the simplest\r\npossible kind, and that her body should be accompanied to the grave by\r\nnot more than two persons. She was buried beside her father and mother\r\nin the churchyard of East Wellow, near her old home in Hampshire. The\r\nbody was borne to the grave by six of her \"children\" of the British\r\nArmy--sergeants drawn from the several regiments of the Guards. Her\r\ndesire that only two persons should follow the coffin could not be\r\nfulfilled. The funeral arrangements were kept as private as was\r\npossible; but there was a wealth of flowers from people of every kind,\r\nage, and degree, and the lane and churchyard were filled with a great\r\ncrowd of men, women, and children, most of them poorly dressed.\r\n\r\nThe family grave is marked by a four-sided stone monument. On two of the\r\nsides are inscriptions, composed by Miss Nightingale, recording the\r\nburial there of her father and mother; on the third, is an inscription\r\nin memorial of their elder daughter, Lady Verney, who is buried at\r\nClaydon. On the fourth side is a small cross with the letters \"F. N.,\"\r\nand the words \"Born 1820. Died 1910.\" The family, as she desired, set\r\nup no other memorial.[254] The hymn sung over her grave was Bishop\r\nHeber's. She had never tired of quoting it in messages to her nurses and\r\nher soldiers, and those who had been about her in the closing years were\r\noften thrilled by the fire which she still put into her recital of the\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n                    The Son of God goes forth to _war_,\r\n                      A kingly crown to gain,\r\n                    His blood-red banner streams afar:\r\n                      _Who follows in his train?_\r\n\r\n  [254] Memorial services were held in St. Paul's Cathedral, in Liverpool\r\n        Cathedral, and in many other places of worship. The English\r\n        community in Florence have set up a symbolical memorial--designed\r\n        by Mr. W. Sargant--in the Cloisters of Santa Croce. In this country\r\n        there are to be several memorials. The Army Nurses have put up a\r\n        memorial window in the chapel of the Military Hospital at Millbank.\r\n        In Derby a statue (by Countess Feodora Gleichen) is to be set up;\r\n        any balance that there may be from the Memorial Fund is to be given\r\n        to District Nursing in the county. A \"National Memorial Fund\" is to\r\n        be devoted, in the first instance, to a statue (by Mr. Arthur\r\n        G. Walker) in some public place in London and, then, to the Nurses'\r\n        Pension Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe character and the life described in this book had many sides; and\r\nthough the essential truth consists in the blending of them all, it is\r\nnecessary in the medium of recital in prose to depict first one side and\r\nthen another. The artist on canvas exhibits the blended tints at one\r\ntime. That is why the portrait by a great painter sometimes tells us\r\nmore of a character at a glance than is gathered from volumes of written\r\nbiography. But no artist painted a portrait of Miss Nightingale in her\r\nprime, and I must do as best I may with my blotching prose in an\r\nendeavour to collect into some general impression what has been told in\r\nthese volumes. I begin with recalling some of the stronger traits; they\r\nwill presently be softened when I turn to other sides of the character\r\nwhich has been illustrated in this Memoir.\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale was by no means a Plaster Saint. She was a woman of\r\nstrong passions--not over-given to praise, not quick to forgive;\r\nsomewhat prone to be censorious, not apt to forget. She was not only a\r\ngentle angel of compassion; she was more of a logician than a\r\nsentimentalist; she knew that to do good work requires a hard head as\r\nwell as a soft heart. It was said by Miss Nightingale of a certain great\r\nlady that \"with the utmost kindness and benevolent intentions she is in\r\nconsequence of want of practical habits of business nothing but good and\r\nbustling, a time-waster and an impediment.\" Miss Nightingale knew hardly\r\nany fault which seemed worse to her in a man than to be unbusiness-like;\r\nin a woman, than to be \"only enthusiastic.\" She found no use for \"angels\r\nwithout hands.\" She was essentially a \"man of facts\" and a \"man of\r\naction.\" She had an equal contempt for those who act without knowledge,\r\nand for those whose knowledge leads to no useful action. She was\r\nherself laborious of detail and scrupulously careful of her premises.\r\n\"Though I write positively,\" she once said, \"I do not think positively.\"\r\nShe weighed every consideration; she sought much competent advice; but\r\nwhen once her decision was taken, she was resolute and masterful--not\r\nlightly turned from her course, impatient of delay, not very tolerant of\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nSomething of this spirit appears in her view of friendship and in the\r\nconduct of her affections. Men and women are placed in the world in\r\norder, she thought, to work for the betterment of the human race, and\r\ntheir work should be the supreme consideration. Mr. Jowett said of Miss\r\nNightingale that she was the only woman he had ever known who put public\r\nduty before private. Whosoever did the will of the Father, the same was\r\nher brother, and sister, and mother. \"_The_ thing wanted in England,\"\r\nshe wrote to Madame Mohl (April 30, 1868), \"to raise women (and to raise\r\nmen too) is: these friendships without love between men and women. And\r\nif between married men and married women all the better.... I think a\r\nwoman who cares for a man because of his convictions, and who ceases to\r\ncare for him if he alters those convictions, is worthy of the highest\r\nreverence. The novels--all novels, the best--which represent women as in\r\nlove with men without any reason at all, and ready to leave their\r\nhighest occupations for love--are to me utterly wearisome--as wearisome\r\nas a juggler's trick--or Table-turning--or Spiritual rapping, when the\r\nspirit says Aw! and that is so sublime that all the women are\r\nsubjugated. Madame Récamier's going to Rome when M. de Chateaubriand was\r\nmade Minister is exactly to me as a soldier deserting on the eve of a\r\nbattle.\" The occasion of this letter was some gossip of the day about a\r\ngreat lady whose friendship with a politician was supposed to have\r\ncooled owing to some intellectual or political disagreement. \"I have the\r\ngreatest reverence for----; and I think hers was one of the best\r\nfriendships that ever was--and for the oddest reason--what do you\r\nthink?--Because she has broken it.\" What she said about Chateaubriand\r\nreflected, from a different point of view, something that Mr. Jowett had\r\nwritten to her in the previous year. \"I am not at all tired,\" he had\r\nsaid (Sept. 1867), \"of hearing about Lord Herbert. That was one of the\r\nbest friendships which there ever was upon earth. Shall I tell you why I\r\nsay this? Because you were willing to have gone to India in 1857.\"\r\nDevotion to a common purpose in active life and equal zeal in the\r\nco-operative prosecution of it: these were the conditions which Miss\r\nNightingale required in friendship. They were realized the most fully in\r\nthe case of five years of her friendship with Sidney Herbert--a period\r\nof which she used to speak, accordingly, as her \"heaven upon earth.\" It\r\nwas the work with him, more than the charm of his conversation and\r\nmanner (though he had both and though she was susceptible to both), that\r\nwas the essence of her pleasure. She had as little taste for\r\nconversation as for knowledge that led nowhither. \"There is nothing so\r\nfatiguing,\" she said, \"as a companion who is always _effleurant_ the\r\ndeepest subjects--never going below the surface; as a person who is\r\nalways inquiring and never coming to any solution or decision. I don't\r\nknow whether Hamlet was mad. But certainly he would have driven me mad.\"\r\n\r\nThe same positive and purposeful spirit, attuned rather to the\r\nintellectual and active sides of human nature than to the emotional,\r\ncoloured Miss Nightingale's preferences in literature--as in this letter\r\nto Madame Mohl (May 20, 1868): \"'What does it pruv?' said the old\r\nScotchwoman of _Paradise Lost_, and was abused for saying it. I say the\r\nsame thing. _Paradise Lost_ pruvs nothing. _Samson Agonistes_ pruvs a\r\ngreat deal. Tennyson never pruvs anything. Browning's _Paracelsus_ pruvs\r\nsomething. Shakespeare, in whatever he writes--in the deepest, highest\r\ntragedies, like 'King Lear' or 'Hamlet'--pruvs everything and does most\r\nexplain the ordinary life of every one of us.\" She was a great reader,\r\nbut she preferred the literature of fact to that of imagination.\r\n\"Wondering,\" she said, \"is like yawning, and leaves the same sensation\r\nbehind it, and should never be allowed except when people are very much\r\nexhausted.\"\r\n\r\nThere followed from all this a certain severity in Miss Nightingale's\r\ndealings with her friends; a certain inability to show tolerance or\r\nunderstanding for other points of view than her own. There was a lady,\r\nonce a fellow-worker, who accused Miss Nightingale roundly of having\r\n\"no idea of friendship.\" The accusation was not true, but one can see\r\nwhat the lady meant. Miss Nightingale was apt to be a little\r\nover-exacting, and to drive her friends rather hard. Also she did not\r\nrelish independence or opposition. \"I like being under obedience to\r\nyou,\" wrote one of her nursing friends, always very dear to her. Not\r\nindeed that Miss Nightingale had any weakness for gush--no one had less;\r\nbut if a friend was otherwise admirable to her--by good sense and zeal,\r\nand so forth, the fact of the \"obedience\" was not other than an\r\nadditional recommendation. She was inclined to resent any diversion on\r\nthe part of her friends to other interests as desertion.\r\n\r\nAll this will, I think, sometimes be felt to be true by those who read\r\nthe present Memoir. Yet it is only part of the truth; and because the\r\nfinal truth resides in the whole it is in a sense not true at all. The\r\ngreatness of Miss Nightingale's character, and the secret of her life's\r\nwork, consist in the union of qualities not often found in the same man\r\nor woman. She was not a sentimentalist; yet she was possessed by an\r\ninfinite compassion. Pity for the sick and sorrowful,--a passionate\r\ndesire to serve them,--devotion to her \"children,\" the common\r\nsoldiers--sympathy with the voiceless peasants of India: these were\r\nruling motives of her life. She scorned those who were \"only\r\nenthusiasts\"; but there was no height of devotion to which a considered\r\nenthusiasm would not lead her. She had in equal measure cleverness and\r\ncharm. She had a pungent wit, but also a loving heart. The sharpness\r\noften prominent in her letters was not always the expression of her real\r\nmind or manner. She shunned \"the broad way and the green\"; but Colonel\r\nLefroy applied to her no less the later words: \"they that overween, No\r\nanger find in thee, but pity and truth.\" She combined in a rare degree\r\nstrength and tenderness. Masterful in action, she was humble, even to\r\nthe verge of morbid abasement, in thought. She was at once Positive and\r\nMystic. All this also will, as I hope, be found proven in the Memoir.\r\n\r\nA curious, and a larger, question is raised by some of the apparent\r\ncontradictions in Miss Nightingale's aim, thoughts, and character. She\r\nwas intensely spiritual; she sought continually for the Kingdom of\r\nHeaven, and she conceived of it as a kingdom of the soul. Yet her aim\r\nmay seem material; what she sought was a kingdom of more airy hospitals,\r\nmore scientific nursing, brighter barracks, cleaner homes, better laid\r\ndrains. It was after all a searching question which Aga Khan put to her,\r\nas he listened to the tale of sanitary improvement during the fifty\r\nyears of her active life. \"But are your people better?\" Are there more\r\nof them, we may conceive him as saying, who have attained to the kingdom\r\nof heaven in their souls? And unless you can show me that such has been\r\nthe case, why have you, with your great influence and powers, devoted\r\nyour life to this service of tables?\r\n\r\nWhat reply she made to the Prince I do not know. The answer in her mind\r\nmay be gathered from the course of her life, the nature of her\r\nspeculations, and the bent of her character. At recurrent intervals she\r\nhad formed thoughts for the main purposes of her life other than those\r\nwhich in fact she fulfilled. We have heard of her desire \"to find a new\r\nreligion for the artizans,\" and there are letters to Mr. Jowett in which\r\nshe speaks of this desire--of the hope to establish on some sure\r\nfoundation an organized creed and church--as the longing of her life.\r\nShe had to abandon it, but never, in the most prosaic or material of her\r\nundertakings did she forget her spiritual ideals. She held, as her ideal\r\nof nursing shows, that \"it takes a soul to raise a body even to a\r\ncleaner sty.\" She held also that the cleaner sty, though it might be the\r\nfirst thing needful, was not the end, but a means. \"We must beware,\" she\r\nwrote, \"both of thinking that we can maintain the 'Kingdom of Heaven\r\nwithin' under all circumstances,--because there are circumstances under\r\nwhich the human being cannot be good,--and also of thinking that the\r\nKingdom of Heaven _without_ will produce the Kingdom of Heaven\r\nwithin.\"[255]\r\n\r\n  [255] _Suggestions for Thought_, vol. ii. p. 205.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's own peculiar genius was for administration and order;\r\nand she had to employ her genius within the fields of opportunity which\r\nher sex and her circumstances offered. She was fond of quoting a passage\r\nwhich she found in one of Sir Samuel Baker's books of travel. \"I, being\r\nunfortunately dependent on their movements, am more like a donkey than\r\nan explorer--that is, saddled and ridden away at a moment's notice.\" \"I\r\nnever did anything,\" she once said to a young friend, \"except when I was\r\nasked.\" It will be agreed by all who have read this Memoir that Miss\r\nNightingale interpreted her mandates in a spacious sense admitting of\r\nmuch initiative. Yet it is true in large measure that her work was the\r\ncreation of circumstances, and was, in some fields, dependent on what\r\nshe and Mr. Jowett used to call \"temples of friendship\" with political\r\nadministrators.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's scope of action was thus limited; but the limits did\r\nnot prevent the application of her fundamental ideas. \"Perhaps,\" she\r\nwrote in one of her meditations (1868), \"it is what I have seen of the\r\nmisery and worthlessness of human life (few have seen more), together\r\nwith the extraordinary power which God has put into the hands of quite\r\nordinary people (if they would but use it) for raising mankind out of\r\nthis misery and worthlessness, which has given me this intense and ever\r\npresent feeling of an Eternal Life leading to perfection for each and\r\nfor every one of us, by God's laws.\" Miss Nightingale did not suppose\r\nthat human perfectibility, that the final union of man with God, was to\r\nbe attained only by better sanitation. But she saw that this was the\r\nfield open to her, and that it admitted of tilling by methods, which if\r\napplied to all departments of life would, as she conceived, lead to the\r\none far-off Divine event. \"Christianity,\" she wrote, \"is to see God in\r\neverything, to find Him out in everything, in the order or laws as of\r\nHis moral or spiritual, so of His political or social, and so of His\r\nphysical worlds.... To Christ God was everything--to us He seems\r\nnothing, almost if not quite nothing, or if He is anything, He is only\r\nthe God of Sundays, and only the God of Sundays as far as going to what\r\nwe call our prayers, not the God of our week-days, our business, and our\r\nplay, our politics and our science, our home life and our social life;\r\nour House of Commons, our Government, our post-office and\r\ncorrespondence--such an enormous item in these days--our Foreign Office,\r\nand our Indian Office.... The Kingdom of Heaven is within, but we must\r\nalso make it so without. There is no public opinion yet, it has to be\r\ncreated, as to not committing blunders for want of knowledge; good\r\nintentions are supposed enough; yet blunders--organized blunders--do\r\nmore mischief than crimes.... To study how to do good work, as a matter\r\nof life or death; to 'agonise' so as to obtain practical wisdom to do\r\nit, there is little or no public opinion enforcing this--condemning the\r\nwant of it. Until you can create such a public opinion little good will\r\nbe done, except by accident or by accidental individuals. But when we\r\nhave such a public opinion, we shall not be far from having a Kingdom of\r\nHeaven externally, even here.\"[256] \"I never despair,\" she had written\r\nsome years before, \"that, in God's good time, every one of us will reap\r\nthe common benefit of obeying all the laws which He has given us for our\r\nwell-being.\" And towards that end, it was the duty of each and all,\r\naccording to their several opportunities, to \"work, work, work.\"[257]\r\n\r\n  [256] _The Mythe of Life: Four Sermons on the Social Mission of the\r\n        Church._ By C. W. Stubbs, 1880, pp. 86, 98. Mr. Stubbs (afterwards\r\n        Bishop of Truro) quoted these passages from a letter written by\r\n        Miss Nightingale to her sister.\r\n\r\n  [257] Letter to Sir Bartle Frere, June 27, 1868.\r\n\r\nHaving found her appointed corner in the vineyard, Miss Nightingale\r\ndevoted her life to it; in equal measure, with careful adjustment of\r\nmeans to ends, and with intense devotion. \"To make an art of _Life_!\"\r\nshe wrote to Madame Mohl (May 20, 1868). \"That is the finest art of all\r\nthe Fine Arts. And few there be that find it. It was the 'one thing\r\nwanting' to dear----. She had the finest moral nature I ever knew. Yet\r\nshe never did any good to herself or to any one else. Because she never\r\ncould make Life an Art. I used sometimes to say to her:--_Do_ you mean\r\nto go on in that way for twenty years?--packing everybody's carpet-bag.\r\nShe always said she didn't. But she always did. And if she did not go on\r\nfor twenty years, it was only because Death came. I am _obliged_ (by my\r\nill-health) to make Life an Art--to be always thinking of it. Because\r\notherwise I should do _nothing_. (I have so little life and strength.)\"\r\nMiss Nightingale had come back from the Crimea full of honour. But she\r\nreturned also seriously injured in health. How naturally might a woman\r\nof less resolute character have rested on her laurels, and sunk into a\r\nlife of gracious repose or valetudinarian indolence! She chose,\r\nhowever, the better and the rougher path. She framed a regimen which\r\nshut her off from many of the common enjoyments of life, which to some\r\ndegree impaired the flow of her domestic affections, but which enabled\r\nher, through nearly fifty years of recurrent weakness, to follow her\r\nhighest ideals and to devote herself to work of public beneficence.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of her life as they were ordered for her, the manner\r\nof her life as she framed it to meet them, led to some other traits of\r\ncharacter which, again, present at first sight a curious contrariety.\r\n\"She is extremely modest,\" said the Prince Consort and Queen Victoria\r\nwhen they met her, and she made the same impression on all who came in\r\ncontact with her whether in the region of public affairs or in that of\r\nnursing. She had a consistent and a perfectly sincere shrinking from\r\nevery form of popular glare and glory. There are passages, however, in\r\nletters to her intimate friends which leave, on a first reading, a\r\nsomewhat different impression. She craved for a full and understanding\r\nsympathy with her mission and her work. She was fully conscious, it\r\nwould seem, of her great powers; she did not always care, in private\r\nletters, to hide or to under-rate the extent of her influence upon men\r\nand affairs. She objected, in one letter to a friend, that Kinglake's\r\nchapter was intolerable because it posed her as \"a Tragedy Queen\"; but\r\nthere are other letters in which she dramatizes herself somewhat; there\r\nis self-pity in them, and there is other self-consciousness. All this,\r\nwhich on a superficial glance may seem to present some difficult\r\ninconsistency, admits, I think, of easy explanation when the conditions\r\nof her life are remembered. She was intensely conscious of a special\r\ndestiny, and the tenacity with which in the face of many obstacles she\r\nclung to her sense of a vocation enabled her to fulfil it. The sphere of\r\nwomen's work and opportunities has been so much widened in the present\r\nday, that readers of a generation later than Florence Nightingale's may\r\nrequire, perhaps, to make some effort of sympathetic imagination in\r\norder to realize how much of a pioneer she was.[258] In her earlier\r\nyears it was a daring novelty for a young woman to put her hand to any\r\nsolid work in political administration or other organizing business. She\r\nknew all this by hard experience, and it emphasized her sense of special\r\ndestiny. The manner of her life threw her at the same time, at each\r\nstage, though in different ways, in upon herself. During the thwarted\r\nyears of her youth, she found little outlet except, as she said, in\r\n\"dreaming\"; in dreaming, that is, of the things she might do, in\r\nimagining herself in this position of influence or in that. When the\r\nopportunity came to her of doing great things, not dreaming them, her\r\nyouth and early womanhood were already past. Miss Nightingale was\r\nthirty-four when she went out to the Crimean war. In the later years,\r\nthe conditions in which she lived again encouraged, almost of necessity,\r\na habit of introspection: a habit which was also confirmed by her\r\nmystical view of the duty of living an inner life of conscious\r\nself-realization. Returning from the East in a state of nervous\r\nexhaustion, she was absorbed in work which could not wait. She was\r\nhaunted for many years by threats of early death. There were such things\r\nto be, such things to do. But she did them for the most part in\r\nloneliness and without any habitual companionship. Except during the\r\nfive years of almost daily converse with Sidney Herbert, she enjoyed\r\nnone of that influence, at once sobering and fortifying, which comes\r\nfrom the equal clash of mind with mind. The result was a strain of\r\nmorbidness which found occasional expression in notes of excessive\r\nself-consciousness.\r\n\r\n  [258] Some passages which I have quoted from Lord Derby's _Speeches_ may\r\n        assist in such an effort. See Vol. I. pp. 272, 305.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a more constant note. The nobility of Miss\r\nNightingale's character and the worth of her life as an example are to\r\nbe found, not least in the fundamental humility of temper and sanity of\r\nself-judgment which caused her to aim with consistent purpose, not only\r\nat great deeds, but at the doing of them from the highest motives. She\r\nnever felt that she had done anything which might not have been done\r\nbetter; and, though she must have been conscious that she had done great\r\nthings, she was for ever examining her motives and finding them fall\r\nshort of her highest ideals. There is a story told of a famous artist,\r\nthat a friend entering his studio found him in tears. \"I have produced\r\na work,\" he said, \"with which I am satisfied, and I shall never produce\r\nanother.\" The premonition was true. No later masterpiece was produced.\r\nThe inspiration of the ideal was gone. That inspiration never forsook\r\nMiss Nightingale in her pursuit of the art of life.\r\n\r\nIn life, as in other arts, what is spontaneous, and perhaps even what is\r\nunregenerate, have often more of charm than what is acquired or learnt\r\nby discipline. And in the case of Miss Nightingale, her elemental vigour\r\nof mind and force of will, will perhaps to some readers seem more\r\nadmirable than the philosophy which she applied to her conduct or the\r\nacquired graces with which she sought to chasten her character. But\r\nhowever this may be, her constant striving after something which she\r\ndeemed better, and the unceasing conflict which she waged, now with\r\nopposition of outward circumstance and now with undisciplined impulses\r\nfrom within, add savour and poignancy to her life.\r\n\r\nNo man knew her so well for so many years as Mr. Jowett, and the thought\r\nof her life never ceased to excite his admiration. \"Most persons are\r\nengaged,\" he wrote at Christmas-time 1886, \"in feasting and\r\nholiday-making amid their friends and relatives. You are alone in your\r\nroom devising plans for the good of the natives of India or of the\r\nEnglish soldiers as you have been for the last thirty years, and always\r\ndeploring your failures as you have been doing for the last thirty\r\nyears, though you have had a far greater and more real success in life\r\nthan any other lady of your time.\" And again: \"There are those who\r\nrespect and love you, not for the halo of glory which surrounded your\r\nname in the Crimea, but for the patient toil which you have endured\r\nsince on behalf of every one who is suffering or wretched.\" To us who\r\nare able to enter even more fully than Mr. Jowett into the inner life of\r\nMiss Nightingale, the respect and admiration may well be yet more\r\nenhanced, as we picture the conditions in which the patient toil was\r\ndone, and remember the struggles of a beautifully sensitive soul in\r\nascending the path towards perfection.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch is the picture of Miss Nightingale which this Book has endeavoured\r\nto draw. As I wrote it I often thought with Mr. Jowett, that the life\r\nof the secluded worker in the solitary bedroom in South Street was more\r\nimpressive even than the better known episodes of Santa Filomena in the\r\nfever-haunted wards of Scutari, or of the Lady-in-Chief giving her\r\norders as she trudged through the snow from hut to hut on the heights of\r\nBalaclava. But it is Miss Nightingale herself who, unconsciously, has\r\nsaid the last words on her Life and Character. In praising one of her\r\nfellow-workers, and, next, in giving counsel to some fellow-seekers\r\nafter good, she used phrases which may well be applied to herself:--\r\n\r\n\"One whose life makes a great difference for all: _all_ are better off\r\nthan if he had not lived; and this betterness is for always, it does not\r\ndie with him--that is the true estimate of a great LIFE.\"\r\n\r\n\"Live your life while you have it. Life is a splendid gift. There is\r\nnothing small in it. For the greatest things grow by God's law out of\r\nthe smallest. But to live your life, you must discipline it. You must\r\nnot fritter it away in 'fair purpose, erring act, inconstant will'; but\r\nmust make your thought, your words, your acts all work to the same end,\r\nand that end not self but God. This is what we call CHARACTER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n               A. LIST OF WRITINGS BY MISS NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\n               B.

Those who have Miss Nightingale's other\r\n     volumes will thus be able to add to them a book which is second to\r\n     none of them in charm of style, and will promote the reform of the\r\n     sanitary condition of the British Army, as well as conduce to the\r\n     well-being of the natives of India.\"\r\n\r\n     Extracts from the \"Observations\" and from \"How People may live and not\r\n     die in India\" (No. 41) were printed in the _Soldier's Friend_,\r\n     July 1, 1865.\r\n\r\n(35) _Proposal for Improved Statistics of Surgical Operations._ Quarto,\r\npp. 7; dated December 1863.\r\n\r\n     The proposal had been submitted to the International Statistical\r\n     Congress held at Berlin in 1863 (see Vol. I. p. 434).

The _Lancet_ approved of Miss Nightingale's\r\n     statistical method (Feb. 27, 1864). The _Medical Times_ (Jan. 30)\r\n     strongly attacked it. Dr. Farr defended it (Feb. 13), and a\r\n     correspondence ensued for some weeks which was as heated as\r\n     professional disputes generally are. The reviews in the general press\r\n     were very numerous.\r\n\r\n(38) _Note on Different Systems of Nursing._ A pamphlet, 8vo, pp. 5\r\n(printed by Harrison & Sons).\r\n\r\n     This is reprinted, slight alterations, from the appendix in the\r\n     _third_ edition of _Notes on Hospitals_.\r\n\r\n(39) _Transactions of the National Association for the Promotion of\r\nSocial Science, 1863_, containing two Papers by F.

I have no reasons. The Indian ryot\r\n     should be represented so that the people may virtually rate themselves\r\n     according to the surveys of what is wanted, and spend the money\r\n     locally under certain orders of an elected board. If this is the case:\r\n     that we wish to give to the Indian native, peasant and Zemindar alike,\r\n     such local representation _as we can_ in spending the taxes he pays,\r\n     is the educated English taxpayer, of _whichever_ sex, to be excluded\r\n     from a share in electing the Imperial representatives? It seems a\r\n     first principle, an axiom: that _every_ householder or taxpayer should\r\n     have a voice in electing those who spend the money we pay, including,\r\n     as this does, interests the most vital to a human being--for instance,\r\n     education. At the same time I do not expect much from it, for I do not\r\n     see that, for instance in America, where suffrage is, I suppose, the\r\n     most extended, there is more (but rather less) of what may truly be\r\n     called freedom or progress than anywhere else. But there can be no\r\n     freedom or progress without representation. And we must give women the\r\n     true education to deserve being represented. _Men_ as well as women\r\n     are not so well endowed with that preparation at present. And if the\r\n     persons represented are not worth much, of course the representatives\r\n     will not be worth much.\r\n\r\n(94) \"The People of India.\" An article in the _Nineteenth Century_,\r\nAugust 1878, pp. 193-221.\r\n\r\n     For this article, see above, p. 290.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1879\r\n\r\n(95) _Letter from Florence Nightingale to the Probationer-Nurses in the\r\n\"Nightingale Fund\" School at St. Thomas's Hospital.

When she had become famous, she shrank from publicity. She\r\nwas very seldom photographed, and as a general rule she refused to sit\r\nfor her portrait. The demand for portraits of her was great, and the\r\ndemand created a supply. This list includes, however, with one probable\r\nexception (No. 5), only such portraits as are authentic.\r\n\r\n(1) 1820-1. Water-colour drawing of F. N. as a baby on the knee of her\r\nItalian nurse Balia. At Lea Hurst.\r\n\r\n(2) 1828. Water-colour drawing of Mrs. Nightingale with her two\r\ndaughters (Florence is on her mother's knee). In the possession of\r\nMrs. Leonard Cunliffe, daughter of Sir Douglas Galton. Reproduced as\r\nfrontispiece to Vol. I.\r\n\r\n(3) 1828. Water-colour drawing of Mrs. Nightingale with her two\r\ndaughters, by A. E. Chalon. At Claydon. (Similar to, but not identical\r\nin costume with, the foregoing.)\r\n\r\n(4) 1839. Water-colour portrait, by William White, of Florence\r\nNightingale (sitting) and her sister, Parthenope, standing. In\r\npossession of Mrs. Coltman.\r\n\r\n(5) _circ._ 1840. Small oil portrait by Augustus L. Egg, R.A. In the\r\nNational Portrait Gallery (No. 1578). This picture was bought from\r\nMrs. Salis Schwabe (an admirer of Miss Nightingale with whom she had a\r\nslight acquaintance) by Mr. William Rathbone, with a view to its\r\npresentation to the nation; and was given to the Portrait Gallery in\r\n1910 by Mrs. Rathbone in accordance with her husband's desire. In view\r\nof these facts, and as the attribution to Egg agrees with dates, the\r\nTrustees accepted the portrait as authentic. Miss Nightingale's family,\r\nhowever, doubt whether it is so. There is no general resemblance. The\r\nface is plump, and all other portraits at that age show a thin face. The\r\nnarrow ridge of F. N.'s nose is not given. The chestnut colour of the\r\nhair in the portrait is not true to life. The eyebrows are unlike. The\r\nexpression is most uncharacteristic. All other early portraits, even\r\nquite slight ones, are remarkable for a peculiarly contained,\r\nself-possessed expression. The dress and ornaments are out of character;\r\nand Miss Nightingale never wore ear-rings. If the portrait be indeed of\r\nher, and by a practised artist, it can hardly have been made from the\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n(6) _c._ 1845. Pencil sketch by Miss Hilary Bonham Carter. In the\r\npossession of Miss B. A. Clough. Reproduced in Vol. I. p. 38.\r\n\r\n(7) _c._ 1850. Full-length, standing beside a pedestal, on which stands\r\nan owl. Engraved by F. Holl from a pencil drawing by Parthenope\r\nNightingale (Lady Verney). Reproduced in the _Illustrated Times_,\r\nFebruary 2, 1856, and as frontispiece to the _Victoria Miniature\r\nAlmanack and Fashionable Remembrancer_ for 1857.\r\n\r\n(8) _c._ 1852. Large pencil head, copied about 1880 by J. R. Parsons\r\nfrom a drawing by Lady Eastlake. The original was in bad condition and\r\nis believed to have been destroyed. The copy is at Lea Hurst.\r\n\r\n(9) _c._ 1852. Photograph, three-quarter face, almost profile;\r\nthree-quarter length, seated, reading. A striped scarf. Taken in\r\nGermany. At Claydon.\r\n\r\n(10) 1854. Photograph, seated, looking down, by Kilburn, then 222 Regent\r\nStreet. Taken during Miss Nightingale's time at Harley Street. There\r\nwere two positions as mentioned in the letter of Mrs. Sutherland noticed\r\nunder No. 15, \"looking down in one, in the other the eyes raised.\" These\r\nare the photographs which some of Miss Nightingale's family considered\r\nthe best.\r\n\r\n(11) 1854. A sketch; seated, reading a book; white flower in her hair;\r\nred cross on her neck. \"H. M. B. C. del.\" [Miss Hilary Bonham Carter,\r\nwhose initials, however, were J. H. B. C.] \"Published November 28, 1854,\r\nby P. and D. Colnaghi: Colnaghi's Authentic Series.\" There was also\r\npublished an uncoloured print of the same drawing, which in turn was\r\nadapted in various forms--as in a print published by W. Bemrose & Sons,\r\nlettered \"Miss Florence Nightingale, the Good Samaritan of Derbyshire,\r\nreading the accounts of the dreadful sufferings of our brave wounded\r\nsoldiers,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\n(12) 1855. Miss Florence Nightingale and Mr. Bracebridge on Cathcart's\r\nHill, May 8, 1855. Lithographed by Day, and published. This drawing was\r\nmade up by Lady Verney and Lady Anne Blunt from a slight sketch by\r\nMrs. Bracebridge. Many other prints, still further removed from life,\r\nwere published--such as: \"Florence Nightingale in the Military Hospital\r\nat Scutari\" (a coloured print published, March 16, 1855, by Read & Co.,\r\n10 Johnson's Court, Fleet Street); \"Miss Florence Nightingale, the\r\nSoldiers' Friend\" (drawn by Elston, published May 1, 1856, by Ellis, 51\r\nJewin Street, City); and \"The Great Military Hospital at Scutari\"\r\n(published, with a sentimental legend, Feb. 24, 1855, by Stannard &\r\nDixon, 7 Poland Street).\r\n\r\n(13) 1856. Oil picture of Miss Nightingale receiving the wounded at\r\nScutari, by Jerry Barratt. Engraved as \"Florence Nightingale at Scutari,\r\nA Mission of Mercy,\" by S. Bellin. The picture is in the possession of\r\nSir Percy Bates, Bart.\r\n\r\n(14) 1856. Photograph, three-quarter length, three-quarter face,\r\nstanding, by The London Stereoscopic Co. This photograph was taken at\r\nthe request of Queen Victoria, and has often been reproduced.\r\n\r\n(15) 1856. Plaster statuette; standing, with a lamp in the right hand,\r\nby Miss Hilary Bonham Carter. At Lea Hurst. There are several replicas,\r\nor versions with some differences. One is at St. Thomas's Hospital;\r\nanother, in Mr. Henry Bonham Carter's possession; another, at Claydon. A\r\nsecond version was, by advice of Mr. Woolner, R.A., made less full in\r\nthe skirt. A small version, on a reduced scale (about 15 in. high), was\r\nalso made, and is very widespread. There is a letter to Miss Nightingale\r\nfrom Mrs. Sutherland (June 1866), in which she says: \"There are\r\nphotographs of the statuette which (though it seems odd to say so) are\r\nmore characteristic than the actual portraits, none of which but the\r\n'owl' one [No. 7], which you deprecate, give a real idea of what you\r\nwere ten years ago.\"\r\n\r\n(16) _c._ 1858. Photograph, full-length, full face, standing, by\r\nGoodman. This was generally considered by Miss Nightingale's family to\r\nbe the best likeness; reproduced in Vol. I. p. 394.\r\n\r\n(17) 1862. Marble bust, by Sir John Steell. This bust, presented to Miss\r\nNightingale by the non-commissioned officers and men of the British\r\nArmy, has been placed in the Museum of the Royal United Service\r\nInstitution in accordance with the provisions of her will. There is a\r\nreplica at Lea Hurst.\r\n\r\n(18) 1864. Commencement of a head by G. F. Watts, R.A. Miss Nightingale\r\nwas persuaded by Sir Harry Verney to receive Mr. Watts on one or two\r\noccasions, who made a beginning only of a portrait. It is very slight,\r\nand Mr. Watts regarded it as so far a failure. He hoped to be able to\r\nresume the work, but abandoned the idea when Sir William Richmond made a\r\nportrait.
