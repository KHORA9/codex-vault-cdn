Beeton in 24 Monthly Parts\r\n1859-1861.\r\n\r\nFirst Published in a Bound Edition 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nI must frankly own, that if I had known, beforehand, that this book\r\nwould have cost me the labour which it has, I should never have been\r\ncourageous enough to commence it. What moved me, in the first instance,\r\nto attempt a work like this, was the discomfort and suffering which I\r\nhad seen brought upon men and women by household mismanagement. I have\r\nalways thought that there is no more fruitful source of family\r\ndiscontent than a housewife's badly-cooked dinners and untidy ways. Men\r\nare now so well served out of doors,--at their clubs, well-ordered\r\ntaverns, and dining-houses, that in order to compete with the\r\nattractions of these places, a mistress must be thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith the theory and practice of cookery, as well as be perfectly\r\nconversant with all the other arts of making and keeping a comfortable\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nIn this book I have attempted to give, under the chapters devoted to\r\ncookery, an intelligible arrangement to every recipe, a list of the\r\n_ingredients_, a plain statement of the _mode_ of preparing each dish,\r\nand a careful estimate of its _cost_, the _number of people_ for whom it\r\nis _sufficient_, and the time when it is _seasonable_. For the matter of\r\nthe recipes, I am indebted, in some measure, to many correspondents of\r\nthe \"Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine,\" who have obligingly placed at my\r\ndisposal their formulas for many original preparations. A large private\r\ncircle has also rendered me considerable service. A diligent study of\r\nthe works of the best modern writers on cookery was also necessary to\r\nthe faithful fulfilment of my task. Friends in England, Scotland,\r\nIreland, France, and Germany, have also very materially aided me. I have\r\npaid great attention to those recipes which come under the head of \"COLD\r\nMEAT COOKERY.\" But in the department belonging to the Cook I have\r\nstriven, too, to make my work something more than a Cookery Book, and\r\nhave, therefore, on the best authority that I could obtain, given an\r\naccount of the natural history of the animals and vegetables which we\r\nuse as food. I have followed the animal from his birth to his appearance\r\non the table; have described the manner of feeding him, and of slaying\r\nhim, the position of his various joints, and, after giving the recipes,\r\nhave described the modes of carving Meat, Poultry, and Game. Skilful\r\nartists have designed the numerous drawings which appear in this work,\r\nand which illustrate, better than any description, many important and\r\ninteresting items. The coloured plates are a novelty not without value.\r\n\r\nBesides the great portion of the book which has especial reference to\r\nthe cook's department, there are chapters devoted to those of the other\r\nservants of the household, who have all, I trust, their duties clearly\r\nassigned to them.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the work will be found valuable chapters on the\r\n\"Management of Children\"----\"The Doctor,\" the latter principally\r\nreferring to accidents and emergencies, some of which are certain to\r\noccur in the experience of every one of us; and the last chapter\r\ncontains \"Legal Memoranda,\" which will be serviceable in cases of doubt\r\nas to the proper course to be adopted in the relations between Landlord\r\nand Tenant, Tax-gatherer and Tax-payer, and Tradesman and Customer.\r\n\r\nThese chapters have been contributed by gentlemen fully entitled to\r\nconfidence; those on medical subjects by an experienced surgeon, and the\r\nlegal matter by a solicitor.\r\n\r\nI wish here to acknowledge the kind letters and congratulations I have\r\nreceived during the progress of this work, and have only further to add,\r\nthat I trust the result of the four years' incessant labour which I have\r\nexpended will not be altogether unacceptable to some of my countrymen\r\nand countrywomen.\r\n\r\nISABELLA BEETON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL

shall rejoice in time to\r\ncome. She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of\r\nkindness. She looketh well to the ways of her household; and eateth not\r\nthe bread of idleness. Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her\r\nhusband also, and he praiseth her.\"--_Proverbs_, xxxi. 25-28.\r\n\r\nI. AS WITH THE COMMANDER OF AN ARMY, or the leader of any enterprise, so\r\nis it with the mistress of a house. Her spirit will be seen through the\r\nwhole establishment; and just in proportion as she performs her duties\r\nintelligently and thoroughly, so will her domestics follow in her path.\r\nOf all those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the\r\nfeminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our\r\nestimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties; for\r\non these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and\r\nwell-being of a family. In this opinion we are borne out by the author\r\nof \"The Vicar of Wakefield,\" who says: \"The modest virgin, the prudent\r\nwife, and the careful matron, are much more serviceable in life than\r\npetticoated philosophers, blustering heroines, or virago queens. She who\r\nmakes her husband and her children happy, who reclaims the one from vice\r\nand trains up the other to virtue, is a much greater character than\r\nladies described in romances, whose whole occupation is to murder\r\nmankind with shafts from their quiver, or their eyes.\"\r\n\r\n2. PURSUING THIS PICTURE, we may add, that to be a good housewife does\r\nnot necessarily imply an abandonment of proper pleasures or amusing\r\nrecreation; and we think it the more necessary to express this, as the\r\nperformance of the duties of a mistress may, to some minds, perhaps seem\r\nto be incompatible with the enjoyment of life. Let us, however, now\r\nproceed to describe some of those home qualities and virtues which are\r\nnecessary to the proper management of a Household, and then point out\r\nthe plan which may be the most profitably pursued for the daily\r\nregulation of its affairs.\r\n\r\n3. EARLY RISING IS ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL QUALITIES which enter into\r\ngood Household Management, as it is not only the parent of health, but\r\nof innumerable other advantages. Indeed, when a mistress is an early\r\nriser, it is almost certain that her house will be orderly and\r\nwell-managed. On the contrary, if she remain in bed till a late hour,\r\nthen the domestics, who, as we have before observed, invariably partake\r\nsomewhat of their mistress's character, will surely become sluggards. To\r\nself-indulgence all are more or less disposed, and it is not to be\r\nexpected that servants are freer from this fault than the heads of\r\nhouses. The great Lord Chatham thus gave his advice in reference to this\r\nsubject:--\"I would have inscribed on the curtains of your bed, and the\r\nwalls of your chamber, 'If you do not rise early, you can make progress\r\nin nothing.'\"\r\n\r\n4. CLEANLINESS IS ALSO INDISPENSABLE TO HEALTH, and must be studied both\r\nin regard to the person and the house, and all that it contains. Cold or\r\ntepid baths should be employed every morning, unless, on account of\r\nillness or other circumstances, they should be deemed objectionable. The\r\nbathing of _children_ will be treated of under the head of \"MANAGEMENT\r\nOF CHILDREN.\"\r\n\r\n5. FRUGALITY AND ECONOMY ARE HOME VIRTUES, without which no household\r\ncan prosper. Dr. Johnson says: \"Frugality may be termed the daughter of\r\nPrudence, the sister of Temperance, and the parent of Liberty. He that\r\nis extravagant will quickly become poor, and poverty will enforce\r\ndependence and invite corruption.\" The necessity of practising economy\r\nshould be evident to every one, whether in the possession of an income\r\nno more than sufficient for a family's requirements, or of a large\r\nfortune, which puts financial adversity out of the question. We must\r\nalways remember that it is a great merit in housekeeping to manage a\r\nlittle well. \"He is a good waggoner,\" says Bishop Hall, \"that can turn\r\nin a little room. To live well in abundance is the praise of the estate,\r\nnot of the person. I will study more how to give a good account of my\r\nlittle, than how to make it more.\" In this there is true wisdom, and it\r\nmay be added, that those who can manage a little well, are most likely\r\nto succeed in their management of larger matters. Economy and frugality\r\nmust never, however, be allowed to degenerate into parsimony and\r\nmeanness.\r\n\r\n6. THE CHOICE OF ACQUAINTANCES is very important to the happiness of a\r\nmistress and her family. A gossiping acquaintance, who indulges in the\r\nscandal and ridicule of her neighbours, should be avoided as a\r\npestilence. It is likewise all-necessary to beware, as Thomson sings,\r\n\r\n                                 \"The whisper'd tale,\r\n  That, like the fabling Nile, no fountain knows;--\r\n  Fair-laced Deceit, whose wily, conscious aye\r\n  Ne'er looks direct; the tongue that licks the dust\r\n  But, when it safely dares, as prompt to sting.\"\r\n\r\nIf the duties of a family do not sufficiently occupy the time of a\r\nmistress, society should be formed of such a kind as will tend to the\r\nmutual interchange of general and interesting information.\r\n\r\n7. FRIENDSHIPS SHOULD NOT BE HASTILY FORMED, nor the heart given, at\r\nonce, to every new-comer. There are ladies who uniformly smile at, and\r\napprove everything and everybody, and who possess neither the courage to\r\nreprehend vice, nor the generous warmth to defend virtue. The friendship\r\nof such persons is without attachment, and their love without affection\r\nor even preference. They imagine that every one who has any penetration\r\nis ill-natured, and look coldly on a discriminating judgment. It should\r\nbe remembered, however, that this discernment does not always proceed\r\nfrom an uncharitable temper, but that those who possess a long\r\nexperience and thorough knowledge of the world, scrutinize the conduct\r\nand dispositions of people before they trust themselves to the first\r\nfair appearances. Addison, who was not deficient in a knowledge of\r\nmankind, observes that \"a friendship, which makes the least noise, is\r\nvery often the most useful; for which reason, I should prefer a prudent\r\nfriend to a zealous one.\" And Joanna Baillie tells us that\r\n\r\n  \"Friendship is no plant of hasty growth,\r\n   Though planted in esteem's deep-fixed soil,\r\n   The gradual culture of kind intercourse\r\n   Must bring it to perfection.\"\r\n\r\n8. HOSPITALITY IS A MOST EXCELLENT VIRTUE; but care must be taken that\r\nthe love of company, for its own sake, does not become a prevailing\r\npassion; for then the habit is no longer hospitality, but dissipation.\r\nReality and truthfulness in this, as in all other duties of life, are\r\nthe points to be studied; for, as Washington Irving well says, \"There is\r\nan emanation from the heart in genuine hospitality, which cannot be\r\ndescribed, but is immediately felt, and puts the stranger at once at his\r\nease.\" With respect to the continuance of friendships, however, it may\r\nbe found necessary, in some cases, for a mistress to relinquish, on\r\nassuming the responsibility of a household, many of those commenced in\r\nthe earlier part of her life. This will be the more requisite, if the\r\nnumber still retained be quite equal to her means and opportunities.\r\n\r\n9. IN CONVERSATION, TRIFLING OCCURRENCES, such as small disappointments,\r\npetty annoyances, and other every-day incidents, should never be\r\nmentioned to your friends. The extreme injudiciousness of repeating\r\nthese will be at once apparent, when we reflect on the unsatisfactory\r\ndiscussions which they too frequently occasion, and on the load of\r\nadvice which they are the cause of being tendered, and which is, too\r\noften, of a kind neither to be useful nor agreeable. Greater events,\r\nwhether of joy or sorrow, should be communicated to friends; and, on\r\nsuch occasions, their sympathy gratifies and comforts. If the mistress\r\nbe a wife, never let an account of her husband's failings pass her lips;\r\nand in cultivating the power of conversation, she should keep the\r\nversified advice of Cowper continually in her memory, that it\r\n\r\n  \"Should flow like water after summer showers,\r\n   Not as if raised by mere mechanic powers.\"\r\n\r\nIn reference to its style, Dr. Johnson, who was himself greatly\r\ndistinguished for his colloquial abilities, says that \"no style is more\r\nextensively acceptable than the narrative, because this does not carry\r\nan air of superiority over the rest of the company; and, therefore, is\r\nmost likely to please them. For this purpose we should store our memory\r\nwith short anecdotes and entertaining pieces of history. Almost every\r\none listens with eagerness to extemporary history. Vanity often\r\nco-operates with curiosity; for he that is a hearer in one place wishes\r\nto qualify himself to be a principal speaker in some inferior company;\r\nand therefore more attention is given to narrations than anything else\r\nin conversation. It is true, indeed, that sallies of wit and quick\r\nreplies are very pleasing in conversation; but they frequently tend to\r\nraise envy in some of the company: but the narrative way neither raises\r\nthis, nor any other evil passion, but keeps all the company nearly upon\r\nan equality, and, if judiciously managed, will at once entertain and\r\nimprove them all.\"\r\n\r\n10. GOOD TEMPER SHOULD BE CULTIVATED by every mistress, as upon it the\r\nwelfare of the household may be said to turn; indeed, its influence can\r\nhardly be over-estimated, as it has the effect of moulding the\r\ncharacters of those around her, and of acting most beneficially on the\r\nhappiness of the domestic circle. Every head of a household should\r\nstrive to be cheerful, and should never fail to show a deep interest in\r\nall that appertains to the well-being of those who claim the protection\r\nof her roof. Gentleness, not partial and temporary, but universal and\r\nregular, should pervade her conduct; for where such a spirit is\r\nhabitually manifested, it not only delights her children, but makes her\r\ndomestics attentive and respectful; her visitors are also pleased by it,\r\nand their happiness is increased.\r\n\r\n11. ON THE IMPORTANT SUBJECT OF DRESS AND FASHION we cannot do better\r\nthan quote an opinion from the eighth volume of the \"Englishwoman's\r\nDomestic Magazine.\" The writer there says, \"Let people write, talk,\r\nlecture, satirize, as they may, it cannot be denied that, whatever is\r\nthe prevailing mode in attire, let it intrinsically be ever so absurd,\r\nit will never _look_ as ridiculous as another, or as any other, which,\r\nhowever convenient, comfortable, or even becoming, is totally opposite\r\nin style to that generally worn.\"\r\n\r\n12. IN PURCHASING ARTICLES OF WEARING APPAREL, whether it be a silk\r\ndress, a bonnet, shawl, or riband, it is well for the buyer to consider\r\nthree things: I. That it be not too expensive for her purse. II. That\r\nits colour harmonize with her complexion, and its size and pattern with\r\nher figure. III. That its tint allow of its being worn with the other\r\ngarments she possesses. The quaint Fuller observes, that the good wife\r\nis none of our dainty dames, who love to appear in a variety of suits\r\nevery day new, as if a gown, like a stratagem in war, were to be used\r\nbut once. But our good wife sets up a sail according to the keel of her\r\nhusband's estate; and, if of high parentage, she doth not so remember\r\nwhat she was by birth, that she forgets what she is by match.\r\n\r\n    To _Brunettes_, or those ladies having dark complexions, silks\r\n    of a grave hue are adapted. For _Blondes_, or those having fair\r\n    complexions, lighter colours are preferable, as the richer,\r\n    deeper hues are too overpowering for the latter. The colours\r\n    which go best together are green with violet; gold-colour with\r\n    dark crimson or lilac; pale blue with scarlet; pink with black\r\n    or white; and gray with scarlet or pink. A cold colour generally\r\n    requires a warm tint to give life to it. Gray and pale blue, for\r\n    instance, do not combine well, both being cold colours.\r\n\r\n13. THE DRESS OF THE MISTRESS should always be adapted to her\r\ncircumstances, and be varied with different occasions. Thus, at\r\nbreakfast she should be attired in a very neat and simple manner,\r\nwearing no ornaments. If this dress should decidedly pertain only to the\r\nbreakfast-hour, and be specially suited for such domestic occupations as\r\nusually follow that meal, then it would be well to exchange it before\r\nthe time for receiving visitors, if the mistress be in the habit of\r\ndoing so. It is still to be remembered, however, that, in changing the\r\ndress, jewellery and ornaments are not to be worn until the full dress\r\nfor dinner is assumed. Further information and hints on the subject of\r\nthe toilet will appear under the department of the \"LADY'S-MAID.\"\r\n\r\n    The advice of Polonius to his son Laertes, in Shakspeare's\r\n    tragedy of \"Hamlet,\" is most excellent; and although given to\r\n    one of the male sex, will equally apply to a \"fayre ladye:\"--\r\n\r\n  \"Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\r\n   But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;\r\n   For the apparel oft proclaims the man.\"\r\n\r\n14. CHARITY AND BENEVOLENCE ARE DUTIES which a mistress owes to herself\r\nas well as to her fellow-creatures; and there is scarcely any income so\r\nsmall, but something may be spared from it, even if it be but \"the\r\nwidow's mite.\" It is to be always remembered, however, that it is the\r\n_spirit_ of charity which imparts to the gift a value far beyond its\r\nactual amount, and is by far its better part.\r\n\r\n  True Charity, a plant divinely nursed,\r\n  Fed by the love from which it rose at first,\r\n  Thrives against hope, and, in the rudest scene,\r\n  Storms but enliven its unfading green;\r\n  Exub'rant is the shadow it supplies,\r\n  Its fruit on earth, its growth above the skies.\r\n\r\n    Visiting the houses of the poor is the only practical way really\r\n    to understand the actual state of each family; and although\r\n    there may be difficulties in following out this plan in the\r\n    metropolis and other large cities, yet in country towns and\r\n    rural districts these objections do not obtain. Great advantages\r\n    may result from visits paid to the poor; for there being,\r\n    unfortunately, much ignorance, generally, amongst them with\r\n    respect to all household knowledge, there will be opportunities\r\n    for advising and instructing them, in a pleasant and unobtrusive\r\n    manner, in cleanliness, industry, cookery, and good management.\r\n\r\n15. IN MARKETING, THAT THE BEST ARTICLES ARE THE CHEAPEST, may be laid\r\ndown as a rule; and it is desirable, unless an experienced and\r\nconfidential housekeeper be kept, that the mistress should herself\r\npurchase all provisions and stores needed for the house. If the mistress\r\nbe a young wife, and not accustomed to order \"things for the house,\" a\r\nlittle practice and experience will soon teach her who are the best\r\ntradespeople to deal with, and what are the best provisions to buy.\r\nUnder each particular head of FISH, MEAT, POULTRY, GAME, &c., will be\r\ndescribed the proper means of ascertaining the quality of these\r\ncomestibles.\r\n\r\n16. A HOUSEKEEPING ACCOUNT-BOOK should invariably be kept, and kept\r\npunctually and precisely. The plan for keeping household accounts, which\r\nwe should recommend, would be to make an entry, that is, write down into\r\na daily diary every amount paid on that particular day, be it ever so\r\nsmall; then, at the end of the month, let these various payments be\r\nranged under their specific heads of Butcher, Baker, &c.; and thus will\r\nbe seen the proportions paid to each tradesman, and any one month's\r\nexpenses may be contrasted with another. The housekeeping accounts\r\nshould be balanced not less than once a month; so that you may see that\r\nthe money you have in hand tallies with your account of it in your\r\ndiary. Judge Haliburton never wrote truer words than when he said, \"No\r\nman is rich whose expenditure exceeds his means, and no one is poor\r\nwhose incomings exceed his outgoings.\"\r\n\r\n    When, in a large establishment, a housekeeper is kept, it will\r\n    be advisable for the mistress to examine her accounts regularly.\r\n    Then any increase of expenditure which may be apparent, can\r\n    easily be explained, and the housekeeper will have the\r\n    satisfaction of knowing whether her efforts to manage her\r\n    department well and economically, have been successful.\r\n\r\n17. ENGAGING DOMESTICS is one of those duties in which the judgment of\r\nthe mistress must be keenly exercised. There are some respectable\r\nregistry-offices, where good servants may sometimes be hired; but the\r\nplan rather to be recommended is, for the mistress to make inquiry\r\namongst her circle of friends and acquaintances, and her tradespeople.\r\nThe latter generally know those in their neighbourhood, who are wanting\r\nsituations, and will communicate with them, when a personal interview\r\nwith some of them will enable the mistress to form some idea of the\r\ncharacters of the applicants, and to suit herself accordingly.\r\n\r\n    We would here point out an error--and a grave one it is--into\r\n    which some mistresses fall. They do not, when engaging a\r\n    servant, expressly tell her all the duties which she will be\r\n    expected to perform. This is an act of omission severely to be\r\n    reprehended. Every portion of work which the maid will have to\r\n    do, should be plainly stated by the mistress, and understood by\r\n    the servant. If this plan is not carefully adhered to, domestic\r\n    contention is almost certain to ensue, and this may not be\r\n    easily settled; so that a change of servants, which is so much\r\n    to be deprecated, is continually occurring.\r\n\r\n18. IN OBTAINING A SERVANT'S CHARACTER, it is not well to be guided by a\r\nwritten one from some unknown quarter; but it is better to have an\r\ninterview, if at all possible, with the former mistress. By this means\r\nyou will be assisted in your decision of the suitableness of the servant\r\nfor your place, from the appearance of the lady and the state of her\r\nhouse. Negligence and want of cleanliness in her and her household\r\ngenerally, will naturally lead you to the conclusion, that her servant\r\nhas suffered from the influence of the bad example.\r\n\r\n    The proper course to pursue in order to obtain a personal\r\n    interview with the lady is this:--The servant in search of the\r\n    situation must be desired to see her former mistress, and ask\r\n    her to be kind enough to appoint a time, convenient to herself,\r\n    when you may call on her; this proper observance of courtesy\r\n    being necessary to prevent any unseasonable intrusion on the\r\n    part of a stranger. Your first questions should be relative to\r\n    the honesty and general morality of her former servant; and if\r\n    no objection is stated in that respect, her other qualifications\r\n    are then to be ascertained. Inquiries should be very minute, so\r\n    that you may avoid disappointment and trouble, by knowing the\r\n    weak points of your domestic.\r\n\r\n19. THE TREATMENT OF SERVANTS is of the highest possible moment, as well\r\nto the mistress as to the domestics themselves. On the head of the house\r\nthe latter will naturally fix their attention; and if they perceive that\r\nthe mistress's conduct is regulated by high and correct principles, they\r\nwill not fail to respect her. If, also, a benevolent desire is shown to\r\npromote their comfort, at the same time that a steady performance of\r\ntheir duty is exacted, then their respect will not be unmingled with\r\naffection, and they will be still more solicitous to continue to deserve\r\nher favour.\r\n\r\n20. IN GIVING A CHARACTER, it is scarcely necessary to say that the\r\nmistress should be guided by a sense of strict justice. It is not fair\r\nfor one lady to recommend to another, a servant she would not keep\r\nherself. The benefit, too, to the servant herself is of small advantage;\r\nfor the failings which she possesses will increase if suffered to be\r\nindulged with impunity. It is hardly necessary to remark, on the other\r\nhand, that no angry feelings on the part of a mistress towards her late\r\nservant, should ever be allowed, in the slightest degree, to influence\r\nher, so far as to induce her to disparage her maid's character.\r\n\r\n21. THE FOLLOWING TABLE OF THE AVERAGE YEARLY WAGES paid to domestics,\r\nwith the various members of the household placed in the order in which\r\nthey are usually ranked, will serve as a guide to regulate the\r\nexpenditure of an establishment:--\r\n\r\n                      When not found in          When found in\r\n                          Livery.

All the domestics mentioned in the above\r\n    table would enter into the establishment of a wealthy nobleman.\r\n    The number of servants, of course, would become smaller in\r\n    proportion to the lesser size of the establishment; and we may\r\n    here enumerate a scale of servants suited to various incomes,\r\n    commencing with--\r\n\r\n  About £1,000 a year--A cook, upper housemaid, nursemaid, under\r\n                housemaid,\r\n       and a man servant.\r\n  About £750 a year--A cook, housemaid, nursemaid, and footboy.\r\n  About £500 a year--A cook, housemaid, and nursemaid.\r\n  About £300 a year--A maid-of-all-work and nursemaid.\r\n  About £200 or £150 a year--A maid-of-all-work (and girl occasionally).\r\n\r\n22. HAVING THUS INDICATED some of the more general duties of the\r\nmistress, relative to the moral government of her household, we will now\r\ngive a few specific instructions on matters having a more practical\r\nrelation to the position which she is supposed to occupy in the eye of\r\nthe world. To do this the more clearly, we will begin with her earliest\r\nduties, and take her completely through the occupations of a day.\r\n\r\n23. HAVING RISEN EARLY, as we have already advised (_see_ 3), and having\r\ngiven due attention to the bath, and made a careful toilet, it will be\r\nwell at once to see that the children have received their proper\r\nablutions, and are in every way clean and comfortable. The first meal of\r\nthe day, breakfast, will then be served, at which all the family should\r\nbe punctually present, unless illness, or other circumstances, prevent.\r\n\r\n24. AFTER BREAKFAST IS OVER, it will be well for the mistress to make a\r\nround of the kitchen and other offices, to see that all are in order,\r\nand that the morning's work has been properly performed by the various\r\ndomestics. The orders for the day should then be given, and any\r\nquestions which the domestics desire to ask, respecting their several\r\ndepartments, should be answered, and any special articles they may\r\nrequire, handed to them from the store-closet.\r\n\r\n    In those establishments where there is a housekeeper, it will\r\n    not be so necessary for the mistress, personally, to perform the\r\n    above-named duties.\r\n\r\n25. AFTER THIS GENERAL SUPERINTENDENCE of her servants, the mistress, if\r\na mother of a young family, may devote herself to the instruction of\r\nsome of its younger members, or to the examination of the state of their\r\nwardrobe, leaving the later portion of the morning for reading, or for\r\nsome amusing recreation. \"Recreation,\" says Bishop Hall, \"is intended to\r\nthe mind as whetting is to the scythe, to sharpen the edge of it, which\r\nwould otherwise grow dull and blunt. He, therefore, that spends his\r\nwhole time in recreation is ever whetting, never mowing; his grass may\r\ngrow and his steed starve; as, contrarily, he that always toils and\r\nnever recreates, is ever mowing, never whetting, labouring much to\r\nlittle purpose. As good no scythe as no edge. Then only doth the work go\r\nforward, when the scythe is so seasonably and moderately whetted that it\r\nmay cut, and so cut, that it may have the help of sharpening.\"\r\n\r\n    Unless the means of the mistress be very circumscribed, and she\r\n    be obliged to devote a great deal of her time to the making of\r\n    her children's clothes, and other economical pursuits, it is\r\n    right that she should give some time to the pleasures of\r\n    literature, the innocent delights of the garden, and to the\r\n    improvement of any special abilities for music, painting, and\r\n    other elegant arts, which she may, happily, possess.\r\n\r\n26. THESE DUTIES AND PLEASURES BEING PERFORMED AND ENJOYED, the hour of\r\nluncheon will have arrived. This is a very necessary meal between an\r\nearly breakfast and a late dinner, as a healthy person, with good\r\nexercise, should have a fresh supply of food once in four hours. It\r\nshould be a light meal; but its solidity must, of course, be, in some\r\ndegree, proportionate to the time it is intended to enable you to wait\r\nfor your dinner, and the amount of exercise you take in the mean time.\r\nAt this time, also, the servants' dinner will be served.\r\n\r\n    In those establishments where an early dinner is served, that\r\n    will, of course, take the place of the luncheon. In many houses,\r\n    where a nursery dinner is provided for the children and about\r\n    one o'clock, the mistress and the elder portion of the family\r\n    make their luncheon at the same time from the same joint, or\r\n    whatever may be provided. A mistress will arrange, according to\r\n    circumstances, the serving of the meal; but the more usual plan\r\n    is for the lady of the house to have the joint brought to her\r\n    table, and afterwards carried to the nursery.\r\n\r\n27. AFTER LUNCHEON, MORNING CALLS AND VISITS may be made and received.\r\nThese may be divided under three heads: those of ceremony, friendship,\r\nand congratulation or condolence. Visits of ceremony, or courtesy, which\r\noccasionally merge into those of friendship, are to be paid under\r\nvarious circumstances. Thus, they are uniformly required after dining at\r\na friend's house, or after a ball, picnic, or any other party. These\r\nvisits should be short, a stay of from fifteen to twenty minutes being\r\nquite sufficient. A lady paying a visit may remove her boa or\r\nneckerchief; but neither her shawl nor bonnet.\r\n\r\n    When other visitors are announced, it is well to retire as soon\r\n    as possible, taking care to let it appear that their arrival is\r\n    not the cause. When they are quietly seated, and the bustle of\r\n    their entrance is over, rise from your chair, taking a kind\r\n    leave of the hostess, and bowing politely to the guests. Should\r\n    you call at an inconvenient time, not having ascertained the\r\n    luncheon hour, or from any other inadvertence, retire as soon as\r\n    possible, without, however, showing that you feel yourself an\r\n    intruder. It is not difficult for any well-bred or even\r\n    good-tempered person, to know what to say on such an occasion,\r\n    and, on politely withdrawing, a promise can be made to call\r\n    again, if the lady you have called on, appear really\r\n    disappointed.\r\n\r\n28. IN PAYING VISITS OF FRIENDSHIP, it will not be so necessary to be\r\nguided by etiquette as in paying visits of ceremony; and if a lady be\r\npressed by her friend to remove her shawl and bonnet, it can be done if\r\nit will not interfere with her subsequent arrangements. It is, however,\r\nrequisite to call at suitable times, and to avoid staying too long, if\r\nyour friend is engaged. The courtesies of society should ever be\r\nmaintained, even in the domestic circle, and amongst the nearest\r\nfriends. During these visits, the manners should be easy and cheerful,\r\nand the subjects of conversation such as may be readily terminated.\r\nSerious discussions or arguments are to be altogether avoided, and there\r\nis much danger and impropriety in expressing opinions of those persons\r\nand characters with whom, perhaps, there is but a slight acquaintance.\r\n(_See_ 6, 7, and 9.)\r\n\r\n    It is not advisable, at any time, to take favourite dogs into\r\n    another lady's drawing-room, for many persons have an absolute\r\n    dislike to such animals; and besides this, there is always a\r\n    chance of a breakage of some article occurring, through their\r\n    leaping and bounding here and there, sometimes very much to the\r\n    fear and annoyance of the hostess. Her children, also, unless\r\n    they are particularly well-trained and orderly, and she is on\r\n    exceedingly friendly terms with the hostess, should not\r\n    accompany a lady in making morning calls. Where a lady, however,\r\n    pays her visits in a carriage, the children can be taken in the\r\n    vehicle, and remain in it until the visit is over.\r\n\r\n29. FOR MORNING CALLS, it is well to be neatly attired; for a costume\r\nvery different to that you generally wear, or anything approaching an\r\nevening dress, will be very much out of place. As a general rule, it may\r\nbe said, both in reference to this and all other occasions, it is better\r\nto be under-dressed than over-dressed.\r\n\r\n    A strict account should be kept of ceremonial visits, and notice\r\n    how soon your visits have been returned. An opinion may thus be\r\n    formed as to whether your frequent visits are, or are not,\r\n    desirable. There are, naturally, instances when the\r\n    circumstances of old age or ill health will preclude any return\r\n    of a call; but when this is the case, it must not interrupt the\r\n    discharge of the duty.\r\n\r\n30. IN PAYING VISITS OF CONDOLENCE, it is to be remembered that they\r\nshould be paid within a week after the event which occasions them. If\r\nthe acquaintance, however, is but slight, then immediately after the\r\nfamily has appeared at public worship. A lady should send in her card,\r\nand if her friends be able to receive her, the visitor's manner and\r\nconversation should be subdued and in harmony with the character of her\r\nvisit. Courtesy would dictate that a mourning card should be used, and\r\nthat visitors, in paying condoling visits, should be dressed in black,\r\neither silk or plain-coloured apparel. Sympathy with the affliction of\r\nthe family, is thus expressed, and these attentions are, in such cases,\r\npleasing and soothing.\r\n\r\n    In all these visits, if your acquaintance or friend be not at\r\n    home, a card should be left. If in a carriage, the servant will\r\n    answer your inquiry and receive your card; if paying your visits\r\n    on foot, give your card to the servant in the hall, but leave to\r\n    go in and rest should on no account be asked. The form of words,\r\n    \"Not at home,\" may be understood in different senses; but the\r\n    only courteous way is to receive them as being perfectly true.\r\n    You may imagine that the lady of the house is really at home,\r\n    and that she would make an exception in your favour, or you may\r\n    think that your acquaintance is not desired; but, in either\r\n    case, not the slightest word is to escape you, which would\r\n    suggest, on your part, such an impression.\r\n\r\n31. IN RECEIVING MORNING CALLS, the foregoing description of the\r\netiquette to be observed in paying them, will be of considerable\r\nservice. It is to be added, however, that the occupations of drawing,\r\nmusic, or reading should be suspended on the entrance of morning\r\nvisitors. If a lady, however, be engaged with light needlework, and none\r\nother is appropriate in the drawing-room, it may not be, under some\r\ncircumstances, inconsistent with good breeding to quietly continue it\r\nduring conversation, particularly if the visit be protracted, or the\r\nvisitors be gentlemen.\r\n\r\n    Formerly the custom was to accompany all visitors quitting the\r\n    house to the door, and there take leave of them; but modern\r\n    society, which has thrown off a great deal of this kind of\r\n    ceremony, now merely requires that the lady of the house should\r\n    rise from her seat, shake hands, or courtesy, in accordance with\r\n    the intimacy she has with her guests, and ring the bell to\r\n    summon the servant to attend them and open the door. In making a\r\n    first call, either upon a newly-married couple, or persons newly\r\n    arrived in the neighbourhood, a lady should leave her husband's\r\n    card together with her own, at the same time, stating that the\r\n    profession or business in which he is engaged has prevented him\r\n    from having the pleasure of paying the visit, with her. It is a\r\n    custom with many ladies, when on the eve of an absence from\r\n    their neighbourhood, to leave or send their own and husband's\r\n    cards, with the letters P. P. C. in the right-hand corner. These\r\n    letters are the initials of the French words, \"_Pour prendre\r\n    congé_,\" meaning, \"To take leave.\"\r\n\r\n32. THE MORNING CALLS BEING PAID OR RECEIVED, and their etiquette\r\nproperly attended to, the next great event of the day in most\r\nestablishments is \"The Dinner;\" and we only propose here to make a few\r\ngeneral remarks on this important topic, as, in future pages, the whole\r\n\"Art of Dining\" will be thoroughly considered, with reference to its\r\neconomy, comfort, and enjoyment.\r\n\r\n33. IN GIVING OR ACCEPTING AN INVITATION FOR DINNER, the following is\r\nthe form of words generally made use of. They, however, can be varied in\r\nproportion to the intimacy or position of the hosts and guests:--\r\n\r\n  Mr. and Mrs. A---- present their compliments to Mr. and Mrs. B----,\r\n  and request the honour, [or hope to have the pleasure] of their\r\n                company\r\n  to dinner on Wednesday, the 6th of December next.\r\n\r\n  A---- STREET,\r\n  _November 13th, 1859. R. S. V. P._\r\n\r\nThe letters in the corner imply \"_Répondez, s'il vous plaît;_\" meaning,\r\n\"an answer will oblige.\" The reply, accepting the invitation, is couched\r\nin the following terms:--\r\n\r\n  Mr. and Mrs. B---- present their compliments to Mr. and Mrs. A---, and\r\n  will do themselves the honour of, [or will have much pleasure in]\r\n  accepting their kind invitation to dinner on the 6th of December next.\r\n\r\n  B---- SQUARE,\r\n  _November 18th, 1859._\r\n\r\n    Cards, or invitations for a dinner-party, should be issued a\r\n    fortnight or three weeks (sometimes even a month) beforehand,\r\n    and care should be taken by the hostess, in the selection of the\r\n    invited guests, that they should be suited to each other. Much\r\n    also of the pleasure of a dinner-party will depend on the\r\n    arrangement of the guests at table, so as to form a due\r\n    admixture of talkers and listeners, the grave and the gay. If an\r\n    invitation to dinner is accepted, the guests should be punctual,\r\n    and the mistress ready in her drawing-room to receive them. At\r\n    some periods it has been considered fashionable to come late to\r\n    dinner, but lately _nous avons changé tout cela_.\r\n\r\n34. THE HALF-HOUR BEFORE DINNER has always been considered as the great\r\nordeal through which the mistress, in giving a dinner-party, will either\r\npass with flying colours, or, lose many of her laurels. The anxiety to\r\nreceive her guests,--her hope that all will be present in due time,--her\r\ntrust in the skill of her cook, and the attention of the other\r\ndomestics, all tend to make these few minutes a trying time. The\r\nmistress, however, must display no kind of agitation, but show her tact\r\nin suggesting light and cheerful subjects of conversation, which will be\r\nmuch aided by the introduction of any particular new book, curiosity of\r\nart, or article of vertu, which may pleasantly engage the attention of\r\nthe company. \"Waiting for Dinner,\" however, is a trying time, and there\r\nare few who have not felt--\r\n\r\n \"How sad it is to sit and pine,\r\n  The long _half-hour_ before we dine!\r\n  Upon our watches oft to look,\r\n  Then wonder at the clock and cook,\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n \"And strive to laugh in spite of Fate!\r\n  But laughter forced soon quits the room,\r\n  And leaves it in its former gloom.\r\n  But lo! the dinner now appears,\r\n  The object of our hopes and fears,\r\n                The end of all our pain!\"\r\n\r\n    In giving an entertainment of this kind, the mistress should\r\n    remember that it is her duty to make her guests feel happy,\r\n    comfortable, and quite at their ease; and the guests should also\r\n    consider that they have come to the house of their hostess to be\r\n    happy. Thus an opportunity is given to all for innocent\r\n    enjoyment and intellectual improvement, when also acquaintances\r\n    may be formed that may prove invaluable through life, and\r\n    information gained that will enlarge the mind. Many celebrated\r\n    men and women have been great talkers; and, amongst others, the\r\n    genial Sir Walter Scott, who spoke freely to every one, and a\r\n    favourite remark of whom it was, that he never did so without\r\n    learning something he didn't know before.\r\n\r\n35. DINNER BEING ANNOUNCED, the host offers his arm to, and places on\r\nhis right hand at the dinner-table, the lady to whom he desires to pay\r\nmost respect, either on account of her age, position, or from her being\r\nthe greatest stranger in the party. If this lady be married and her\r\nhusband present, the latter takes the hostess to her place at table, and\r\nseats himself at her right hand. The rest of the company follow in\r\ncouples, as specified by the master and mistress of the house, arranging\r\nthe party according to their rank and other circumstances which may be\r\nknown to the host and hostess.\r\n\r\n    It will be found of great assistance to the placing of a party\r\n    at the dinner-table, to have the names of the guests neatly (and\r\n    correctly) written on small cards, and placed at that part of\r\n    the table where it is desired they should sit. With respect to\r\n    the number of guests, it has often been said, that a private\r\n    dinner-party should consist of not less than the number of the\r\n    Graces, or more than that of the Muses. A party of ten or twelve\r\n    is, perhaps, in a general way, sufficient to enjoy themselves\r\n    and be enjoyed. White kid gloves are worn by ladies at\r\n    dinner-parties, but should be taken off before the business of\r\n    dining commences.\r\n\r\n36. THE GUESTS BEING SEATED AT THE DINNER-TABLE, the lady begins to help\r\nthe soup, which is handed round, commencing with the gentleman on her\r\nright and on her left, and continuing in the same order till all are\r\nserved. It is generally established as a rule, not to ask for soup or\r\nfish twice, as, in so doing, part of the company may be kept waiting too\r\nlong for the second course, when, perhaps, a little revenge is taken by\r\nlooking at the awkward consumer of a second portion. This rule, however,\r\nmay, under various circumstances, not be considered as binding.\r\n\r\n    It is not usual, where taking wine is _en règle_, for a\r\n    gentleman to ask a lady to take wine until the fish or soup is\r\n    finished, and then the gentleman honoured by sitting on the\r\n    right of the hostess, may politely inquire if she will do him\r\n    the honour of taking wine with him. This will act as a signal to\r\n    the rest of the company, the gentleman of the house most\r\n    probably requesting the same pleasure of the ladies at his right\r\n    and left. At many tables, however, the custom or fashion of\r\n    drinking wine in this manner, is abolished, and the servant\r\n    fills the glasses of the guests with the various wines suited to\r\n    the course which is in progress.\r\n\r\n37. WHEN DINNER IS FINISHED, THE DESSERT is placed on the table,\r\naccompanied with finger-glasses. It is the custom of some gentlemen to\r\nwet a corner of the napkin; but the hostess, whose behaviour will set\r\nthe tone to all the ladies present, will merely wet the tips of her\r\nfingers, which will serve all the purposes required. The French and\r\nother continentals have a habit of gargling the mouth; but it is a\r\ncustom which no English gentlewoman should, in the slightest degree,\r\nimitate.\r\n\r\n38. WHEN FRUIT HAS BEEN TAKEN, and a glass or two of wine passed round,\r\nthe time will have arrived when the hostess will rise, and thus give the\r\nsignal for the ladies to leave the gentlemen, and retire to the\r\ndrawing-room. The gentlemen of the party will rise at the same time, and\r\nhe who is nearest the door, will open it for the ladies, all remaining\r\ncourteously standing until the last lady has withdrawn. Dr. Johnson has\r\na curious paragraph on the effects of a dinner on men. \"Before dinner,\"\r\nhe says, \"men meet with great inequality of understanding; and those who\r\nare conscious of their inferiority have the modesty not to talk. When\r\nthey have drunk wine, every man feels himself happy, and loses that\r\nmodesty, and grows impudent and vociferous; but he is not improved, he\r\nis only not sensible of his defects.\" This is rather severe, but there\r\nmay be truth in it.\r\n\r\n    In former times, when the bottle circulated freely amongst the\r\n    guests, it was necessary for the ladies to retire earlier than\r\n    they do at present, for the gentlemen of the company soon became\r\n    unfit to conduct themselves with that decorum which is essential\r\n    in the presence of ladies. Thanks, however, to the improvements\r\n    in modern society, and the high example shown to the nation by\r\n    its most illustrious personages, temperance is, in these happy\r\n    days, a striking feature in the character of a gentleman.\r\n    Delicacy of conduct towards the female sex has increased with\r\n    the esteem in which they are now universally held, and thus, the\r\n    very early withdrawing of the ladies from the dining-room is to\r\n    be deprecated. A lull in the conversation will seasonably\r\n    indicate the moment for the ladies' departure.\r\n\r\n39. AFTER-DINNER INVITATIONS MAY BE GIVEN; by which we wish to be\r\nunderstood, invitations for the evening. The time of the arrival of\r\nthese visitors will vary according to their engagements, or sometimes\r\nwill be varied in obedience to the caprices of fashion. Guests invited\r\nfor the evening are, however, generally considered at liberty to arrive\r\nwhenever it will best suit themselves,--usually between nine and twelve,\r\nunless earlier hours are specifically named. By this arrangement, many\r\nfashionable people and others, who have numerous engagements to fulfil,\r\noften contrive to make their appearance at two or three parties in the\r\ncourse of one evening.\r\n\r\n40. THE ETIQUETTE OF THE DINNER-PARTY TABLE being disposed of, let us\r\nnow enter slightly into that of an evening party or ball. The\r\ninvitations issued and accepted for either of these, will be written in\r\nthe same style as those already described for a dinner-party. They\r\nshould be sent out _at least_ three weeks before the day fixed for the\r\nevent, and should be replied to within a week of their receipt. By\r\nattending to these courtesies, the guests will have time to consider\r\ntheir engagements and prepare their dresses, and the hostess will, also,\r\nknow what will be the number of her party.\r\n\r\n    If the entertainment is to be simply an evening party, this must\r\n    be specified on the card or note of invitation. Short or verbal\r\n    invitations, except where persons are exceedingly intimate, or\r\n    are very near relations, are very far from proper, although, of\r\n    course, in this respect and in many other respects, very much\r\n    always depends on the manner in which the invitation is given.\r\n    True politeness, however, should be studied even amongst the\r\n    nearest friends and relations; for the mechanical forms of good\r\n    breeding are of great consequence, and too much familiarity may\r\n    have, for its effect, the destruction of friendship.\r\n\r\n41. AS THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ARRIVE, each should be shown to a room\r\nexclusively provided for their reception; and in that set apart for the\r\nladies, attendants should be in waiting to assist in uncloaking, and\r\nhelping to arrange the hair and toilet of those who require it. It will\r\nbe found convenient, in those cases where the number of guests is large,\r\nto provide numbered tickets, so that they can be attached to the cloaks\r\nand shawls of each lady, a duplicate of which should be handed to the\r\nguest. Coffee is sometimes provided in this, or an ante-room, for those\r\nwho would like to partake of it.\r\n\r\n42. AS THE VISITORS ARE ANNOUNCED BY THE SERVANT, it is not necessary\r\nfor the lady of the house to advance each time towards the door, but\r\nmerely to rise from her seat to receive their courtesies and\r\ncongratulations. If, indeed, the hostess wishes to show particular\r\nfavour to some peculiarly honoured guests, she may introduce them to\r\nothers, whose acquaintance she may imagine will be especially suitable\r\nand agreeable. It is very often the practice of the master of the house\r\nto introduce one gentleman to another, but occasionally the lady\r\nperforms this office; when it will, of course, be polite for the persons\r\nthus introduced to take their seats together for the time being.\r\n\r\n    The custom of non-introduction is very much in vogue in many\r\n    houses, and guests are thus left to discover for themselves the\r\n    position and qualities of the people around them. The servant,\r\n    indeed, calls out the names of all the visitors as they arrive,\r\n    but, in many instances, mispronounces them; so that it will not\r\n    be well to follow this information, as if it were an unerring\r\n    guide. In our opinion, it is a cheerless and depressing custom,\r\n    although, in thus speaking, we do not allude to the large\r\n    assemblies of the aristocracy, but to the smaller parties of the\r\n    middle classes.\r\n\r\n43. A SEPARATE ROOM OR CONVENIENT BUFFET should be appropriated for\r\nrefreshments, and to which the dancers may retire; and cakes and\r\nbiscuits, with wine negus, lemonade, and ices, handed round. A supper is\r\nalso mostly provided at the private parties of the middle classes; and\r\nthis requires, on the part of the hostess, a great deal of attention and\r\nsupervision. It usually takes place between the first and second parts\r\nof the programme of the dances, of which there should be several\r\nprettily written or printed copies distributed about the ball-room.\r\n\r\n    _In private parties_, a lady is not to refuse the invitation of\r\n    a gentleman to dance, unless she be previously engaged. The\r\n    hostess must be supposed to have asked to her house only those\r\n    persons whom she knows to be perfectly respectable and of\r\n    unblemished character, as well as pretty equal in position; and\r\n    thus, to decline the offer of any gentleman present, would be a\r\n    tacit reflection on the master and mistress of the house. It may\r\n    be mentioned here, more especially for the young who will read\r\n    this book, that introductions at balls or evening parties, cease\r\n    with the occasion that calls them forth, no introduction, at\r\n    these times, giving a gentleman a right to address, afterwards,\r\n    a lady. She is, consequently, free, next morning, to pass her\r\n    partner at a ball of the previous evening without the slightest\r\n    recognition.\r\n\r\n44. THE BALL IS GENERALLY OPENED, that is, the first place in the first\r\nquadrille is occupied, by the lady of the house. When anything prevents\r\nthis, the host will usually lead off the dance with the lady who is\r\neither the highest in rank, or the greatest stranger. It will be well\r\nfor the hostess, even if she be very partial to the amusement, and a\r\ngraceful dancer, not to participate in it to any great extent, lest her\r\nlady guests should have occasion to complain of her monopoly of the\r\ngentlemen, and other causes of neglect. A few dances will suffice to\r\nshow her interest in the entertainment, without unduly trenching on the\r\nattention due to her guests. In all its parts a ball should be\r\nperfect,--\r\n\r\n  \"The music, and the banquet, and the wine;\r\n  The garlands, the rose-odours, and the flowers.\"\r\n\r\n    The hostess or host, during the progress of a ball, will\r\n    courteously accost and chat with their friends, and take care\r\n    that the ladies are furnished with seats, and that those who\r\n    wish to dance are provided with partners. A gentle hint from the\r\n    hostess, conveyed in a quiet ladylike manner, that certain\r\n    ladies have remained unengaged during several dances, is sure\r\n    not to be neglected by any gentleman. Thus will be studied the\r\n    comfort and enjoyment of the guests, and no lady, in leaving the\r\n    house, will be able to feel the chagrin and disappointment of\r\n    not having been invited to \"stand up\" in a dance during the\r\n    whole of the evening.\r\n\r\n45. WHEN ANY OF THE CARRIAGES OF THE GUESTS ARE ANNOUNCED, or the time\r\nfor their departure arrived, they should make a slight intimation to the\r\nhostess, without, however, exciting any observation, that they are about\r\nto depart. If this cannot be done, however, without creating too much\r\nbustle, it will be better for the visitors to retire quietly without\r\ntaking their leave. During the course of the week, the hostess will\r\nexpect to receive from every guest a call, where it is possible, or\r\ncards expressing the gratification experienced from her entertainment.\r\nThis attention is due to every lady for the pains and trouble she has\r\nbeen at, and tends to promote social, kindly feelings.\r\n\r\n46. HAVING THUS DISCOURSED of parties of pleasure, it will be an\r\ninteresting change to return to the more domestic business of the house,\r\nalthough all the details we have been giving of dinner-parties, balls,\r\nand the like, appertain to the department of the mistress. Without a\r\nknowledge of the etiquette to be observed on these occasions, a mistress\r\nwould be unable to enjoy and appreciate those friendly pleasant meetings\r\nwhich give, as it were, a fillip to life, and make the quiet happy home\r\nof an English gentlewoman appear the more delightful and enjoyable. In\r\ntheir proper places, all that is necessary to be known respecting the\r\ndishes and appearance of the breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper tables,\r\nwill be set forth in this work.\r\n\r\n47. A FAMILY DINNER AT HOME, compared with either giving or going to a\r\ndinner-party, is, of course, of much more frequent occurrence, and many\r\nwill say, of much greater importance. Both, however, have to be\r\nconsidered with a view to their nicety and enjoyment; and the latter\r\nmore particularly with reference to economy. These points will be\r\nespecially noted in the following pages on \"Household Cookery.\" Here we\r\nwill only say, that for both mistress and servants, as well in large as\r\nsmall households, it will be found, by far, the better plan, to cook and\r\nserve the dinner, and to lay the tablecloth and the sideboard, with the\r\nsame cleanliness, neatness, and scrupulous exactness, whether it be for\r\nthe mistress herself alone, a small family, or for \"company.\" If this\r\nrule be strictly adhered to, all will find themselves increase in\r\nmanaging skill; whilst a knowledge of their daily duties will become\r\nfamiliar, and enable them to meet difficult occasions with ease, and\r\novercome any amount of obstacles.\r\n\r\n48. OF THE MANNER OF PASSING EVENINGS AT HOME, there is none pleasanter\r\nthan in such recreative enjoyments as those which relax the mind from\r\nits severer duties, whilst they stimulate it with a gentle delight.\r\nWhere there are young people forming a part of the evening circle,\r\ninteresting and agreeable pastime should especially be promoted. It is\r\nof incalculable benefit to them that their homes should possess all the\r\nattractions of healthful amusement, comfort, and happiness; for if they\r\ndo not find pleasure there, they will seek it elsewhere. It ought,\r\ntherefore, to enter into the domestic policy of every parent, to make\r\nher children feel that home is the happiest place in the world; that to\r\nimbue them with this delicious home-feeling is one of the choicest gifts\r\na parent can bestow.\r\n\r\n    Light or fancy needlework often forms a portion of the evening's\r\n    recreation for the ladies of the household, and this may be\r\n    varied by an occasional game at chess or backgammon. It has\r\n    often been remarked, too, that nothing is more delightful to the\r\n    feminine members of a family, than the reading aloud of some\r\n    good standard work or amusing publication. A knowledge of polite\r\n    literature may be thus obtained by the whole family, especially\r\n    if the reader is able and willing to explain the more difficult\r\n    passages of the book, and expatiate on the wisdom and beauties\r\n    it may contain. This plan, in a great measure, realizes the\r\n    advice of Lord Bacon, who says, \"Read not to contradict and\r\n    refute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk\r\n    and discourse, but to weigh and consider.\"\r\n\r\n49. IN RETIRING FOR THE NIGHT, it is well to remember that early rising\r\nis almost impossible, if late going to bed be the order, or rather\r\ndisorder, of the house. The younger members of a family should go early\r\nand at regular hours to their beds, and the domestics as soon as\r\npossible after a reasonably appointed hour. Either the master or the\r\nmistress of a house should, after all have gone to their separate rooms,\r\nsee that all is right with respect to the lights and fires below; and no\r\nservants should, on any account, be allowed to remain up after the heads\r\nof the house have retired.\r\n\r\n50. HAVING THUS GONE FROM EARLY RISING TO EARLY RETIRING, there remain\r\nonly now to be considered a few special positions respecting which the\r\nmistress of the house will be glad to receive some specific information.\r\n\r\n51. WHEN A MISTRESS TAKES A HOUSE in a new locality, it will be\r\netiquette for her to wait until the older inhabitants of the\r\nneighbourhood call upon her; thus evincing a desire, on their part, to\r\nbecome acquainted with the new comer. It may be, that the mistress will\r\ndesire an intimate acquaintance with but few of her neighbours; but it\r\nis to be specially borne in mind that all visits, whether of ceremony,\r\nfriendship, or condolence, should be punctiliously returned.\r\n\r\n52. YOU MAY PERHAPS HAVE BEEN FAVOURED with letters of introduction from\r\nsome of your friends, to persons living in the neighbourhood to which\r\nyou have just come. In this case inclose the letter of introduction in\r\nan envelope with your card. Then, if the person, to whom it is\r\naddressed, calls in the course of a few days, the visit should be\r\nreturned by you within the week, if possible. Any breach of etiquette,\r\nin this respect, will not readily be excused.\r\n\r\n    In the event of your being invited to dinner under the above\r\n    circumstances, nothing but necessity should prevent you from\r\n    accepting the invitation. If, however, there is some distinct\r\n    reason why you cannot accept, let it be stated frankly and\r\n    plainly, for politeness and truthfulness should be ever allied.\r\n    An opportunity should, also, be taken to call in the course of a\r\n    day or two, in order to politely express your regret and\r\n    disappointment at not having been able to avail yourself of\r\n    their kindness.\r\n\r\n53. IN GIVING A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION, it should always be handed to\r\nyour friend, unsealed. Courtesy dictates this, as the person whom you\r\nare introducing would, perhaps, wish to know in what manner he or she\r\nwas spoken of. Should you _receive_ a letter from a friend, introducing\r\nto you any person known to and esteemed by the writer, the letter should\r\nbe immediately acknowledged, and your willingness expressed to do all in\r\nyour power to carry out his or her wishes.\r\n\r\n54. SUCH ARE THE ONEROUS DUTIES which enter into the position of the\r\nmistress of a house, and such are, happily, with a slight but continued\r\nattention, of by no means difficult performance. She ought always to\r\nremember that she is the first and the last, the Alpha and the Omega in\r\nthe government of her establishment; and that it is by her conduct that\r\nits whole internal policy is regulated. She is, therefore, a person of\r\nfar more importance in a community than she usually thinks she is. On\r\nher pattern her daughters model themselves; by her counsels they are\r\ndirected; through her virtues all are honoured;--\"her children rise up\r\nand call her blessed; her husband, also, and he praiseth her.\"\r\nTherefore, let each mistress always remember her responsible position,\r\nnever approving a mean action, nor speaking an unrefined word. Let her\r\nconduct be such that her inferiors may respect her, and such as an\r\nhonourable and right-minded man may look for in his wife and the mother\r\nof his children. Let her think of the many compliments and the sincere\r\nhomage that have been paid to her sex by the greatest philosophers and\r\nwriters, both in ancient and modern times. Let her not forget that she\r\nhas to show herself worthy of Campbell's compliment when he said,--\r\n\r\n  \"The world was sad! the garden was a wild!\r\n   And man the hermit sigh'd, till _woman_ smiled.\"\r\n\r\nLet her prove herself, then, the happy companion of man, and able to\r\ntake unto herself the praises of the pious prelate, Jeremy Taylor, who\r\nsays,--\"A good wife is Heaven's last best gift to man,--his angel and\r\nminister of graces innumerable,--his gem of many virtues,--his casket of\r\njewels--her voice is sweet music--her smiles his brightest day;--her\r\nkiss, the guardian of his innocence;--her arms, the pale of his safety,\r\nthe balm of his health, the balsam of his life;--her industry, his\r\nsurest wealth;--her economy, his safest steward;--her lips, his faithful\r\ncounsellors;--her bosom, the softest pillow of his cares; and her\r\nprayers, the ablest advocates of Heaven's blessings on his head.\"\r\n\r\nCherishing, then, in her breast the respected utterances of the good and\r\nthe great, let the mistress of every house rise to the responsibility of\r\nits management; so that, in doing her duty to all around her, she may\r\nreceive the genuine reward of respect, love, and affection!\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Many mistresses have experienced the horrors of house-hunting,\r\nand it is well known that \"three removes are as good (or bad, rather) as\r\na fire.\" Nevertheless, it being quite evident that we must, in these\r\ndays at least, live in houses, and are sometimes obliged to change our\r\nresidences, it is well to consider some of the conditions which will add\r\nto, or diminish, the convenience and comfort of our homes.\r\n\r\nAlthough the choice of a house must be dependent on so many different\r\ncircumstances with different people, that to give any specific\r\ndirections on this head would be impossible and useless; yet it will be\r\nadvantageous, perhaps, to many, if we point out some of those general\r\nfeatures as to locality, soil, aspect, &c., to which the attention of\r\nall house-takers should be carefully directed.\r\n\r\nRegarding the locality, we may say, speaking now more particularly of a\r\ntown house, that it is very important to the health and comfort of a\r\nfamily, that the neighbourhood of all factories of any kind, producing\r\nunwholesome effluvia or smells, should be strictly avoided. Neither is\r\nit well to take a house in the immediate vicinity of where a noisy trade\r\nis carried on, as it is unpleasant to the feelings, and tends to\r\nincrease any existing irritation of the system.\r\n\r\nReferring to soils; it is held as a rule, that a gravel soil is superior\r\nto any other, as the rain drains through it very quickly, and it is\r\nconsequently drier and less damp than clay, upon which water rests a far\r\nlonger time. A clay country, too, is not so pleasant for walking\r\nexercise as one in which gravel predominates.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the house should be well considered, and it should be\r\nborne in mind that the more sunlight that comes into the house, the\r\nhealthier is the habitation. The close, fetid smell which assails one on\r\nentering a narrow court, or street, in towns, is to be assigned to the\r\nwant of light, and, consequently, air. A house with a south or\r\nsouth-west aspect, is lighter, warmer, drier, and consequently more\r\nhealthy, than one facing the north or north-east.\r\n\r\nGreat advances have been made, during the last few years, in the\r\nprinciples of sanitary knowledge, and one most essential point to be\r\nobserved in reference to a house, is its \"drainage,\" as it has been\r\nproved in an endless number of cases, that bad or defective drainage is\r\nas certain to destroy health as the taking of poisons. This arises from\r\nits injuriously affecting the atmosphere; thus rendering the air we\r\nbreathe unwholesome and deleterious. Let it be borne in mind, then, that\r\nunless a house is effectually drained, the health of its inhabitants is\r\nsure to suffer; and they will be susceptible of ague, rheumatism,\r\ndiarrhoea, fevers, and cholera.\r\n\r\nWe now come to an all-important point,--that of the water supply. The\r\nvalue of this necessary article has also been lately more and more\r\nrecognized in connection with the question of health and life; and most\r\nhouses are well supplied with every convenience connected with water.\r\nLet it, however, be well understood, that no house, however suitable in\r\nother respects, can be desirable, if this grand means of health and\r\ncomfort is, in the slightest degree, scarce or impure. No caution can be\r\ntoo great to see that it is pure and good, as well as plentiful; for,\r\nknowing, as we do, that not a single part of our daily food is prepared\r\nwithout it, the importance of its influence on the health of the inmates\r\nof a house cannot be over-rated.\r\n\r\nVentilation is another feature which must not be overlooked. In a\r\ngeneral way, enough of air is admitted by the cracks round the doors and\r\nwindows; but if this be not the case, the chimney will smoke; and other\r\nplans, such as the placing of a plate of finely-perforated zinc in the\r\nupper part of the window, must be used. Cold air should never be\r\nadmitted under the doors, or at the bottom of a room, unless it be close\r\nto the fire or stove; for it will flow along the floor towards the\r\nfireplace, and thus leave the foul air in the upper part of the room,\r\nunpurified, cooling, at the same time, unpleasantly and injuriously, the\r\nfeet and legs of the inmates.\r\n\r\nThe rent of a house, it has been said, should not exceed one-eighth of\r\nthe whole income of its occupier; and, as a general rule, we are\r\ndisposed to assent to this estimate, although there may be many\r\ncircumstances which would not admit of its being considered infallible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSEKEEPER.\r\n\r\n55. AS SECOND IN COMMAND IN THE HOUSE, except in large establishments,\r\nwhere there is a house steward, the housekeeper must consider herself as\r\nthe immediate representative of her mistress, and bring, to the\r\nmanagement of the household, all those qualities of honesty, industry,\r\nand vigilance, in the same degree as if she were at the head of her\r\n_own_ family. Constantly on the watch to detect any wrong-doing on the\r\npart of any of the domestics, she will overlook all that goes on in the\r\nhouse, and will see that every department is thoroughly attended to, and\r\nthat the servants are comfortable, at the same time that their various\r\nduties are properly performed.\r\n\r\n    Cleanliness, punctuality, order, and method, are essentials in\r\n    the character of a good housekeeper. Without the first, no\r\n    household can be said to be well managed. The second is equally\r\n    all-important; for those who are under the housekeeper will take\r\n    their \"cue\" from her; and in the same proportion as punctuality\r\n    governs her movements, so will it theirs. Order, again, is\r\n    indispensable; for by it we wish to be understood that \"there\r\n    should be a place for everything, and everything in its place.\"\r\n    Method, too, is most necessary; for when the work is properly\r\n    contrived, and each part arranged in regular succession, it will\r\n    be done more quickly and more effectually.\r\n\r\n56. A NECESSARY QUALIFICATION FOR A HOUSEKEEPER is, that she should\r\nthoroughly understand accounts. She will have to write in her books an\r\naccurate registry of all sums paid for any and every purpose, all the\r\ncurrent expenses of the house, tradesmen's bills, and other extraneous\r\nmatter. As we have mentioned under the head of the Mistress (_see_ 16),\r\na housekeeper's accounts should be periodically balanced, and examined\r\nby the head of the house. Nothing tends more to the satisfaction of both\r\nemployer and employed, than this arrangement. \"Short reckonings make\r\nlong friends,\" stands good in this case, as in others.\r\n\r\n    It will be found an excellent plan to take an account of every\r\n    article which comes into the house connected with housekeeping,\r\n    and is not paid for at the time. The book containing these\r\n    entries can then be compared with the bills sent in by the\r\n    various tradesmen, so that any discrepancy can be inquired into\r\n    and set right. An intelligent housekeeper will, by this means,\r\n    too, be better able to judge of the average consumption of each\r\n    article by the household; and if that quantity be, at any time,\r\n    exceeded, the cause may be discovered and rectified, if it\r\n    proceed from waste or carelessness.\r\n\r\n57. ALTHOUGH IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE COOK, the housekeeper does not\r\ngenerally much interfere, yet it is necessary that she should possess a\r\ngood knowledge of the culinary art, as, in many instances, it may be\r\nrequisite for her to take the superintendence of the kitchen. As a rule,\r\nit may be stated, that the housekeeper, in those establishments where\r\nthere is no house steward or man cook, undertakes the preparation of the\r\nconfectionary, attends to the preserving and pickling of fruits and\r\nvegetables; and, in a general way, to the more difficult branches of the\r\nart of cookery.\r\n\r\n    Much of these arrangements will depend, however, on the\r\n    qualifications of the cook; for instance, if she be an able\r\n    artiste, there will be but little necessity for the housekeeper\r\n    to interfere, except in the already noticed articles of\r\n    confectionary, &c. On the contrary, if the cook be not so clever\r\n    an adept in her art, then it will be requisite for the\r\n    housekeeper to give more of her attention to the business of the\r\n    kitchen, than in the former case. It will be one of the duties\r\n    of the housekeeper to attend to the marketing, in the absence of\r\n    either a house steward or man cook.\r\n\r\n58. THE DAILY DUTIES OF A HOUSEKEEPER are regulated, in a great measure,\r\nby the extent of the establishment she superintends. She should,\r\nhowever, rise early, and see that all the domestics are duly performing\r\ntheir work, and that everything is progressing satisfactorily for the\r\npreparation of the breakfast for the household and family. After\r\nbreakfast, which, in large establishments, she will take in the\r\n\"housekeeper's room\" with the lady's-maid, butler, and valet, and where\r\nthey will be waited on by the still-room maid, she will, on various days\r\nset apart for each purpose, carefully examine the household linen, with\r\na view to its being repaired, or to a further quantity being put in hand\r\nto be made; she will also see that the furniture throughout the house is\r\nwell rubbed and polished; and will, besides, attend to all the necessary\r\ndetails of marketing and ordering goods from the tradesmen.\r\n\r\n    The housekeeper's room is generally made use of by the\r\n    lady's-maid, butler, and valet, who take there their breakfast,\r\n    tea, and supper. The lady's-maid will also use this apartment as\r\n    a sitting-room, when not engaged with her lady, or with some\r\n    other duties, which would call her elsewhere. In different\r\n    establishments, according to their size and the rank of the\r\n    family, different rules of course prevail. For instance, in the\r\n    mansions of those of very high rank, and where there is a house\r\n    steward, there are two distinct tables kept, one in the\r\n    steward's room for the principal members of the household, the\r\n    other in the servants' hall, for the other domestics. At the\r\n    steward's dinner-table, the steward and housekeeper preside; and\r\n    here, also, are present the lady's-maid, butler, valet, and head\r\n    gardener. Should any visitors be staying with the family, their\r\n    servants, generally the valet and lady's-maid, will be admitted\r\n    to the steward's table.\r\n\r\n59. AFTER DINNER, the housekeeper, having seen that all the members of\r\nthe establishment have regularly returned to their various duties, and\r\nthat all the departments of the household are in proper working order,\r\nwill have many important matters claiming her attention. She will,\r\npossibly, have to give the finishing touch to some article of\r\nconfectionary, or be occupied with some of the more elaborate processes\r\nof the still-room. There may also be the dessert to arrange, ice-creams\r\nto make; and all these employments call for no ordinary degree of care,\r\ntaste, and attention.\r\n\r\n    The still-room was formerly much more in vogue than at present;\r\n    for in days of \"auld lang syne,\" the still was in constant\r\n    requisition for the supply of sweet-flavoured waters for the\r\n    purposes of cookery, scents and aromatic substances used in the\r\n    preparation of the toilet, and cordials in cases of accidents\r\n    and illness. There are some establishments, however, in which\r\n    distillation is still carried on, and in these, the still-room\r\n    maid has her old duties to perform. In a general way, however,\r\n    this domestic is immediately concerned with the housekeeper. For\r\n    the latter she lights the fire, dusts her room, prepares the\r\n    breakfast-table, and waits at the different meals taken in the\r\n    housekeeper's room (_see_ 58). A still-room maid may learn a\r\n    very great deal of useful knowledge from her intimate connection\r\n    with the housekeeper, and if she be active and intelligent, may\r\n    soon fit herself for a better position in the household.\r\n\r\n60. IN THE EVENING, the housekeeper will often busy herself with the\r\nnecessary preparations for the next day's duties. Numberless small, but\r\nstill important arrangements, will have to be made, so that everything\r\nmay move smoothly. At times, perhaps, attention will have to be paid to\r\nthe breaking of lump-sugar, the stoning of raisins, the washing,\r\ncleansing, and drying of currants, &c. The evening, too, is the best\r\ntime for setting right her account of the expenditure, and duly writing\r\na statement of moneys received and paid, and also for making memoranda\r\nof any articles she may require for her storeroom or other departments.\r\n\r\n    Periodically, at some convenient time,--for instance, quarterly\r\n    or half-yearly, it is a good plan for the housekeeper to make an\r\n    inventory of everything she has under her care, and compare this\r\n    with the lists of a former period; she will then be able to\r\n    furnish a statement, if necessary, of the articles which, on\r\n    account of time, breakage, loss, or other causes, it has been\r\n    necessary to replace or replenish.\r\n\r\n61. IN CONCLUDING THESE REMARKS on the duties of the housekeeper, we\r\nwill briefly refer to the very great responsibility which attaches to\r\nher position. Like \"Caesar's wife,\" she should be \"above suspicion,\" and\r\nher honesty and sobriety unquestionable; for there are many temptations\r\nto which she is exposed. In a physical point of view, a housekeeper\r\nshould be healthy and strong, and be particularly clean in her person,\r\nand her hands, although they may show a degree of roughness, from the\r\nnature of some of her employments, yet should have a nice inviting\r\nappearance. In her dealings with the various tradesmen, and in her\r\nbehaviour to the domestics under her, the demeanour and conduct of the\r\nhousekeeper should be such as, in neither case, to diminish, by an undue\r\nfamiliarity, her authority or influence.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--It will be useful for the mistress and housekeeper to know the\r\nbest seasons for various occupations connected with Household\r\nManagement; and we, accordingly, subjoin a few hints which we think will\r\nprove valuable.\r\n\r\nAs, in the winter months, servants have much more to do, in consequence\r\nof the necessity there is to attend to the number of fires throughout\r\nthe household, not much more than the ordinary every-day work can be\r\nattempted.\r\n\r\nIn the summer, and when the absence of fires gives the domestics more\r\nleisure, then any extra work that is required, can be more easily\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nThe spring is the usual period set apart for house-cleaning, and\r\nremoving all the dust and dirt, which will necessarily, with the best of\r\nhousewives, accumulate during the winter months, from the smoke of the\r\ncoal, oil, gas, &c. This season is also well adapted for washing and\r\nbleaching linen, &c., as, the weather, not being then too hot for the\r\nexertions necessary in washing counterpanes, blankets, and heavy things\r\nin general, the work is better and more easily done than in the intense\r\nheats of July, which month some recommend for these purposes. Winter\r\ncurtains should be taken down, and replaced by the summer white ones;\r\nand furs and woollen cloths also carefully laid by. The former should be\r\nwell shaken and brushed, and then pinned upon paper or linen, with\r\ncamphor to preserve them from the moths. Furs, &c., will be preserved in\r\nthe same way. Included, under the general description of house-cleaning,\r\nmust be understood, turning out all the nooks and corners of drawers,\r\ncupboards, lumber-rooms, lofts, &c., with a view of getting rid of all\r\nunnecessary articles, which only create dirt and attract vermin;\r\nsweeping of chimneys, taking up carpets, painting and whitewashing the\r\nkitchen and offices, papering rooms, when needed, and, generally\r\nspeaking, the house putting on, with the approaching summer, a bright\r\nappearance, and a new face, in unison with nature. Oranges now should be\r\npreserved, and orange wine made.\r\n\r\nThe summer will be found, as we have mentioned above, in consequence of\r\nthe diminution of labour for the domestics, the best period for\r\nexamining and repairing household linen, and for \"putting to rights\" all\r\nthose articles which have received a large share of wear and tear during\r\nthe dark winter days. In direct reference to this matter, we may here\r\nremark, that sheets should be turned \"sides to middle\" before they are\r\nallowed to get very thin. Otherwise, patching, which is uneconomical\r\nfrom the time it consumes, and is unsightly in point of appearance, will\r\nhave to be resorted to. In June and July, gooseberries, currants,\r\nraspberries, strawberries, and other summer fruits, should be preserved,\r\nand jams and jellies made. In July, too, the making of walnut ketchup\r\nshould be attended to, as the green walnuts will be approaching\r\nperfection for this purpose. Mixed pickles may also be now made, and it\r\nwill be found a good plan to have ready a jar of pickle-juice (for the\r\nmaking of which all information will be given in future pages), into\r\nwhich to put occasionally some young French beans, cauliflowers, &c.\r\n\r\nIn the early autumn, plums of various kinds are to be bottled and\r\npreserved, and jams and jellies made. A little later, tomato sauce, a\r\nmost useful article to have by you, may be prepared; a supply of apples\r\nlaid in, if you have a place to keep them, as also a few keeping pears\r\nand filberts. Endeavour to keep also a large vegetable marrow,--it will\r\nbe found delicious in the winter.\r\n\r\nIn October and November, it will be necessary to prepare for the cold\r\nweather, and get ready the winter clothing for the various members of\r\nthe family. The white summer curtains will now be carefully put away,\r\nthe fireplaces, grates, and chimneys looked to, and the House put in a\r\nthorough state of repair, so that no \"loose tile\" may, at a future day,\r\ninterfere with your comfort, and extract something considerable from\r\nyour pocket.\r\n\r\nIn December, the principal household duty lies in preparing for the\r\ncreature comforts of those near and dear to us, so as to meet old\r\nChristmas with a happy face, a contented mind, and a full larder; and in\r\nstoning the plums, washing the currants, cutting the citron, beating the\r\neggs, and MIXING THE PUDDING, a housewife is not unworthily greeting the\r\ngenial season of all good things.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT AND ECONOMY OF THE KITCHEN.\r\n\r\n62. \"THE DISTRIBUTION OF A KITCHEN,\" says Count Rumford, the celebrated\r\nphilosopher and physician, who wrote so learnedly on all subjects\r\nconnected with domestic economy and architecture, \"must always depend so\r\nmuch on local circumstances, that general rules can hardly be given\r\nrespecting it; the principles, however, on which this distribution\r\nought, in all cases, to be made, are simple and easy to be understood,\"\r\nand, in his estimation, these resolve themselves into symmetry of\r\nproportion in the building and convenience to the cook. The requisites\r\nof a good kitchen, however, demand something more special than is here\r\npointed out. It must be remembered that it is the great laboratory of\r\nevery household, and that much of the \"weal or woe,\" as far as regards\r\nbodily health, depends upon the nature of the preparations concocted\r\nwithin its walls. A good kitchen, therefore, should be erected with a\r\nview to the following particulars. 1. Convenience of distribution in its\r\nparts, with largeness of dimension. 2. Excellence of light, height of\r\nceiling, and good ventilation. 3. Easiness of access, without passing\r\nthrough the house. 4. Sufficiently remote from the principal apartments\r\nof the house, that the members, visitors, or guests of the family, may\r\nnot perceive the odour incident to cooking, or hear the noise of\r\nculinary operations. 5. Plenty of fuel and water, which, with the\r\nscullery, pantry, and storeroom, should be so near it, as to offer the\r\nsmallest possible trouble in reaching them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 1.]\r\n\r\n    The kitchens of the Middle Ages, in England, are said to have\r\n    been constructed after the fashion of those of the Romans. They\r\n    were generally octagonal, with several fireplaces, but no\r\n    chimneys; neither was there any wood admitted into the building.\r\n    The accompanying cut, fig. 1, represents the turret which was\r\n    erected on the top of the conical roof of the kitchen at\r\n    Glastonbury Abbey, and which was perforated with holes to allow\r\n    the smoke of the fire, as well as the steam from cooking, to\r\n    escape. Some kitchens had funnels or vents below the eaves to\r\n    let out the steam, which was sometimes considerable, as the\r\n    Anglo-Saxons used their meat chiefly in a boiled state. From\r\n    this circumstance, some of their large kitchens had four ranges,\r\n    comprising a boiling-place for small boiled meats, and a\r\n    boiling-house for the great boiler. In private houses the\r\n    culinary arrangements were no doubt different; for Du Cange\r\n    mentions a little kitchen with a chamber, even in a solarium, or\r\n    upper floor.\r\n\r\n63. THE SIMPLICITY OF THE PRIMITIVE AGES has frequently been an object\r\nof poetical admiration, and it delights the imagination to picture men\r\nliving upon such fruits as spring spontaneously from the earth, and\r\ndesiring no other beverages to slake their thirst, but such as fountains\r\nand rivers supply. Thus we are told, that the ancient inhabitants of\r\nArgos lived principally on pears; that the Arcadians revelled in acorns,\r\nand the Athenians in figs. This, of course, was in the golden age,\r\nbefore ploughing began, and when mankind enjoyed all kinds of plenty\r\nwithout having to earn their bread \"by the sweat of their brow.\" This\r\ndelightful period, however, could not last for ever, and the earth\r\nbecame barren, and continued unfruitful till Ceres came and taught the\r\nart of sowing, with several other useful inventions. The first whom she\r\ntaught to till the ground was Triptolemus, who communicated his\r\ninstructions to his countrymen the Athenians. Thence the art was carried\r\ninto Achaia, and thence into Arcadia. Barley was the first grain that\r\nwas used, and the invention of bread-making is ascribed to Pan.\r\n\r\n    The use of fire, as an instrument of cookery, must have been\r\n    coeval with this invention of bread, which, being the most\r\n    necessary of all kinds of food, was frequently used in a sense\r\n    so comprehensive as to include both meat and drink. It was, by\r\n    the Greeks, baked under the ashes.\r\n\r\n64. IN THE PRIMARY AGES it was deemed unlawful to eat flesh, and when\r\nmankind began to depart from their primitive habits, the flesh of swine\r\nwas the first that was eaten. For several ages, it was pronounced\r\nunlawful to slaughter oxen, from an estimate of their great value in\r\nassisting men to cultivate the ground; nor was it usual to kill young\r\nanimals, from a sentiment which considered it cruel to take away the\r\nlife of those that had scarcely tasted the joys of existence.\r\n\r\n    At this period no cooks were kept, and we know from Homer that\r\n    his ancient heroes prepared and dressed their victuals with\r\n    their own hands. Ulysses, for example, we are told, like a\r\n    modern charwoman, excelled at lighting a fire, whilst Achilles\r\n    was an adept at turning a spit. Subsequently, heralds, employed\r\n    in civil and military affairs, filled the office of cooks, and\r\n    managed marriage feasts; but this, no doubt, was after mankind\r\n    had advanced in the art of living, a step further than\r\n    _roasting_, which, in all places, was the ancient manner of\r\n    dressing meat.\r\n\r\n65. THE AGE OF ROASTING we may consider as that in which the use of the\r\nmetals would be introduced as adjuncts to the culinary art; and amongst\r\nthese, iron, the most useful of them all, would necessarily take a\r\nprominent place. This metal is easily oxidized, but to bring it to a\r\nstate of fusibility, it requires a most intense heat. Of all the metals,\r\nit is the widest diffused and most abundant; and few stones or mineral\r\nbodies are without an admixture of it. It possesses the valuable\r\nproperty of being welded by hammering; and hence its adaptation to the\r\nnumerous purposes of civilized life.\r\n\r\n    Metallic grains of iron have been found in strawberries, and a\r\n    twelfth of the weight of the wood of dried oak is said to\r\n    consist of this metal. Blood owes its colour of redness to the\r\n    quantity of iron it contains, and rain and snow are seldom\r\n    perfectly free from it. In the arts it is employed in three\r\n    states,--as _cast_ iron, _wrought_ iron, and _steel_. In each of\r\n    these it largely enters into the domestic economy, and stoves,\r\n    grates, and the general implements of cookery, are usually\r\n    composed of it. In antiquity, its employment was, comparatively\r\n    speaking, equally universal. The excavations made at Pompeii\r\n    have proved this. The accompanying cuts present us with\r\n    specimens of stoves, both ancient and modern. Fig. 2 is the\r\n    remains of a kitchen stove found in the house of Pansa, at\r\n    Pompeii, and would seem, in its perfect state, not to have been\r\n    materially different from such as are in use at the present day.\r\n    Fig. 3 is a self-acting, simple open range in modern use, and\r\n    may be had of two qualities, ranging, according to their\r\n    dimensions, from £3. 10s. and £3. 18s. respectively, up to £4.\r\n    10s. and £7. 5s. They are completely fitted up with oven,\r\n    boiler, sliding cheek, wrought-iron bars, revolving shelves, and\r\n    brass tap. Fig. 4, is called the Improved Leamington Kitchener,\r\n    and is said to surpass any other range in use, for easy cooking\r\n    by one fire. It has a hot plate, which is well calculated for an\r\n    ironing-stove, and on which as many vessels as will stand upon\r\n    it, may be kept boiling, without being either soiled or injured.\r\n    Besides, it has a perfectly ventilated and spacious wrought-iron\r\n    roaster, with movable shelves, draw-out stand, double\r\n    dripping-pan, and meat-stand. The roaster can be converted into\r\n    an oven by closing the valves, when bread and pastry can be\r\n    baked in it in a superior manner. It also has a large iron\r\n    boiler with brass tap and steam-pipe, round and square gridirons\r\n    for chops and steaks, ash-pan, open fire for roasting, and a set\r\n    of ornamental covings with plate-warmer attached. It took a\r\n    first-class prize and medal in the Great Exhibition of 1851, and\r\n    was also exhibited, with all the recent improvements, at the\r\n    Dublin Exhibition in 1853. Fig. 5 is another kitchener, adapted\r\n    for large families. It has on the one side, a large ventilated\r\n    oven; and on the other, the fire and roaster. The hot plate is\r\n    over all, and there is a back boiler, made of wrought iron, with\r\n    brass tap and steam-pipe. In other respects it resembles Fig. 4,\r\n    with which it possesses similar advantages of construction.\r\n    Either maybe had at varying prices, according to size, from £5.\r\n    15s. up to £23. 10s. They are supplied by Messrs. Richard & John\r\n    Slack 336, Strand, London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 5.]\r\n\r\n66. FROM KITCHEN RANGES to the implements used in cookery is but a step.\r\nWith these, every kitchen should be well supplied, otherwise the cook\r\nmust not be expected to \"perform her office\" in a satisfactory manner.\r\nOf the culinary utensils of the ancients, our knowledge is very limited;\r\nbut as the art of living, in every civilized country, is pretty much the\r\nsame, the instruments for cooking must, in a great degree, bear a\r\nstriking resemblance to each other. On referring to classical\r\nantiquities, we find mentioned, among household utensils, leather bags,\r\nbaskets constructed of twigs, reeds, and rushes; boxes, basins, and\r\nbellows; bread-moulds, brooms, and brushes; caldrons, colanders,\r\ncisterns, and chafing-dishes; cheese-rasps, knives, and ovens of the\r\nDutch kind; funnels and frying-pans; handmills, soup-ladles, milk-pails,\r\nand oil-jars; presses, scales, and sieves; spits of different sizes, but\r\nsome of them large enough to roast an ox; spoons, fire-tongs, trays,\r\ntrenchers, and drinking-vessels; with others for carrying food,\r\npreserving milk, and holding cheese. This enumeration, if it does\r\nnothing else, will, to some extent, indicate the state of the simpler\r\nkinds of mechanical arts among the ancients.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 8.]\r\n\r\n    In so far as regards the shape and construction of many of the\r\n    kitchen utensils enumerated above, they bore a great resemblance\r\n    to our own. This will be seen by the accompanying cuts. Fig. 6\r\n    is an ancient stock-pot in bronze, which seems to have been made\r\n    to hang over the fire, and was found in the buried city of\r\n    Pompeii. Fig. 7 is one of modern make, and may be obtained\r\n    either of copper or wrought iron, tinned inside. Fig. 8 is\r\n    another of antiquity, with a large ladle and colander, with\r\n    holes attached. It is taken from the column of Trajan. The\r\n    modern ones can be obtained at all prices, according to size,\r\n    from 13s. 6d. up to £1. 1s.\r\n\r\n67. IN THE MANUFACTURE OF THESE UTENSILS, bronze metal seems to have\r\nbeen much in favour with the ancients. It was chosen not only for their\r\ndomestic vessels, but it was also much used for their public sculptures\r\nand medals. It is a compound, composed of from six to twelve parts of\r\ntin to one hundred of copper. It gives its name to figures and all\r\npieces of sculpture made of it. Brass was another favourite metal, which\r\nis composed of copper and zinc. It is more fusible than copper, and not\r\nso apt to tarnish. In a pure state it is not malleable, unless when hot,\r\nand after it has been melted twice it will not bear the hammer. To\r\nrender it capable of being wrought, it requires 7 lb. of lead to be put\r\nto 1 cwt. of its own material.\r\n\r\n    The Corinthian brass of antiquity was a mixture of silver, gold,\r\n    and copper. A fine kind of brass, supposed to be made by the\r\n    cementation of copper plates with calamine, is, in Germany,\r\n    hammered out into leaves, and is called Dutch metal in this\r\n    country. It is employed in the same way as gold leaf. Brass is\r\n    much used for watchworks, as well as for wire.\r\n\r\n68. The braziers, ladles, stewpans, saucepans, gridirons, and colanders\r\nof antiquity might generally pass for those of the English manufacture\r\nof the present day, in so far as shape is concerned. In proof of this we\r\nhave placed together the following similar articles of ancient and\r\nmodern pattern, in order that the reader may, at a single view, see\r\nwherein any difference that is between them, consists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 9. Modern.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 10. Ancient.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 11. Modern.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 12. Ancient.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 13. Modern.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 14. Ancient.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 15. Modern.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 16. Modern.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 17. Ancient.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 18. Ancient.]\r\n\r\n    _Figs_. 9 and 10 are flat sauce or _sauté_ pans, the ancient one\r\n    being fluted in the handle, and having at the end a ram's head.\r\n    Figs. 11 and 12 are colanders, the handle of the ancient one\r\n    being adorned, in the original, with carved representations of a\r\n    cornucopia, a satyr, a goat, pigs, and other animals. Any\r\n    display of taste in the adornment of such utensils, might seem\r\n    to be useless; but when we remember how much more natural it is\r\n    for us all to be careful of the beautiful and costly, than of\r\n    the plain and cheap, it may even become a question in the\r\n    economy of a kitchen, whether it would not, in the long run, be\r\n    cheaper to have articles which displayed some tasteful ingenuity\r\n    in their manufacture, than such as are so perfectly plain as to\r\n    have no attractions whatever beyond their mere suitableness to\r\n    the purposes for which they are made. Figs. 13 and 14 are\r\n    saucepans, the ancient one being of bronze, originally copied\r\n    from the cabinet of M. l'Abbé Charlet, and engraved in the\r\n    Antiquities of Montfaucon. Figs. 15 and 17 are gridirons, and 16\r\n    and 18 dripping-pans. In all these utensils the resemblance\r\n    between such as were in use 2,000 years ago, and those in use at\r\n    the present day, is strikingly manifest.\r\n\r\n69. SOME OF THE ANCIENT UTENSILS represented in the above cuts, are\r\ncopied from those found amid the ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii. These\r\nRoman cities were, in the first century, buried beneath the lava of an\r\neruption of Vesuvius, and continued to be lost to the world till the\r\nbeginning of the last century, when a peasant, in digging for a well,\r\ngradually discovered a small temple with some statues. Little notice,\r\nhowever, was taken of this circumstance till 1736, when the king of\r\nNaples, desiring to erect a palace at Portici, caused extensive\r\nexcavations to be made, when the city of Herculaneum was slowly unfolded\r\nto view. Pompeii was discovered about 1750, and being easier cleared\r\nfrom the lava in which it had so long been entombed, disclosed itself as\r\nit existed immediately before the catastrophe which overwhelmed it,\r\nnearly two thousand years ago. It presented, to the modern world, the\r\nperfect picture of the form and structure of an ancient Roman city. The\r\ninterior of its habitations, shops, baths, theatres, and temples, were\r\nall disclosed, with many of the implements used by the workmen in their\r\nvarious trades, and the materials on which they were employed, when the\r\ndoomed city was covered with the lavian stream.\r\n\r\n70. AMONGST THE MOST ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS of the kitchen are scales or\r\nweighing-machines for family use. These are found to have existed among\r\nthe ancients, and must, at a very early age, have been both publicly and\r\nprivately employed for the regulation of quantities. The modern English\r\nweights were adjusted by the 27th chapter of Magna Charta, or the great\r\ncharter forced, by the barons, from King John at Runnymede, in Surrey.\r\nTherein it is declared that the weights, all over England, shall be the\r\nsame, although for different commodities there were two different kinds,\r\nTroy and Avoirdupois. The origin of both is taken from a grain of wheat\r\ngathered in the middle of an ear. The standard of measures was\r\noriginally kept at Winchester, and by a law of King Edgar was ordained\r\nto be observed throughout the kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 20.]\r\n\r\n    Fig. 19 is an ancient pair of common scales, with two basins and\r\n    a movable weight, which is made in the form of a head, covered\r\n    with the pileus, because Mercury had the weights and measures\r\n    under his superintendence. It is engraved on a stone in the\r\n    gallery of Florence. Fig. 20 represents a modern\r\n    weighing-machine, of great convenience, and generally in use in\r\n    those establishments where a great deal of cooking is carried\r\n    on.\r\n\r\n71. ACCOMPANYING THE SCALES, or weighing-machines, there should be\r\nspice-boxes, and sugar and biscuit-canisters of either white or japanned\r\ntin. The covers of these should fit tightly, in order to exclude the\r\nair, and if necessary, be lettered in front, to distinguish them. The\r\nwhite metal of which they are usually composed, loses its colour when\r\nexposed to the air, but undergoes no further change. It enters largely\r\ninto the composition of culinary utensils, many of them being entirely\r\ncomposed of tinned sheet-iron; the inside of copper and iron vessels\r\nalso, being usually what is called _tinned_. This art consists of\r\ncovering any metal with a thin coating of tin; and it requires the metal\r\nto be covered, to be perfectly clean and free from rust, and also that\r\nthe tin, itself, be purely metallic, and entirely cleared from all ashes\r\nor refuse. Copper boilers, saucepans, and other kitchen utensils, are\r\ntinned after they are manufactured, by being first made hot and the tin\r\nrubbed on with resin. In this process, nothing ought to be used but pure\r\ngrain-tin. Lead, however, is sometimes mixed with that metal, not only\r\nto make it lie more easily, but to adulterate it--a pernicious practice,\r\nwhich in every article connected with the cooking and preparation of\r\nfood, cannot be too severely reprobated.--The following list, supplied\r\nby Messrs. Richard & John Slack, 336, Strand, will show the articles\r\nrequired for the kitchen of a family in the middle class of life,\r\nalthough it does not contain all the things that may be deemed necessary\r\nfor some families, and may contain more than are required for others. As\r\nMessrs. Slack themselves, however, publish a useful illustrated\r\ncatalogue, which may be had at their establishment _gratis_, and which\r\nit will be found advantageous to consult by those about to furnish, it\r\nsupersedes the necessity of our enlarging that which we give:--\r\n\r\n                                 s.  d.\r\n\r\n  1 Tea-kettle                   6   6\r\n  1 Toasting-fork                1   0\r\n  1 Bread-grater                 1   0\r\n  1 Pair of Brass Candlesticks   3   6\r\n  1 Teapot and Tray              6   6\r\n  1 Bottle-jack                  9   6\r\n  6 Spoons                       1   6\r\n  2 Candlesticks                 2   6\r\n  1 Candle-box                   1   4\r\n  6 Knives and Forks             5   3\r\n  2 Sets of Skewers              1   0\r\n  1 Meat-chopper                 1   9\r\n  1 Cinder-sifter                1   3\r\n  1 Coffee-pot                   2   3\r\n  1 Colander                     1   6\r\n  3 Block-tin Saucepans          5   9\r\n  5 Iron Saucepans              12   0\r\n  1 Ditto and Steamer            6   6\r\n  1 Large Boiling-pot           10   0\r\n  4 Iron Stewpans                8   9\r\n  1 Dripping-pan and Stand       6   6\r\n  1 Dustpan                      1   0\r\n  1 Fish and Egg-slice           1   9\r\n  2 Fish-kettles                10   0\r\n  1 Flour-box                    1   0\r\n  3 Flat-irons                   3   6\r\n  2 Frying-pans                  4   0\r\n  1 Gridiron                     2   0\r\n  1 Mustard-pot                  1   0\r\n  1 Salt-cellar                  0   8\r\n  1 Pepper-box                   0   6\r\n  1 Pair of Bellows              2   0\r\n  3 Jelly-moulds                 8   0\r\n  1 Plate-basket                 5   6\r\n  1 Cheese-toaster               1  10\r\n  1 Coal-shovel                  2   6\r\n  1 Wood Meat-screen            30   0\r\n\r\n  The Set                  £8   11   1\r\n\r\n\r\n72. AS NOT ONLY HEALTH BUT LIFE may be said to depend on the cleanliness\r\nof culinary utensils, great attention must be paid to their condition\r\ngenerally, but more especially to that of the saucepans, stewpans, and\r\nboilers. Inside they should be kept perfectly clean, and where an open\r\nfire is used, the outside as clean as possible. With a Leamington range,\r\nsaucepans, stewpans, &c., can be kept entirely free from smoke and soot\r\non the outside, which is an immense saving of labour to the cook or\r\nscullery-maid. Care should be taken that the lids fit tight and close,\r\nso that soups or gravies may not be suffered to waste by evaporation.\r\nThey should be made to keep the steam in and the smoke out, and should\r\nalways be bright on the upper rim, where they do not immediately come in\r\ncontact with the fire. Soup-pots and kettles should be washed\r\nimmediately After being used, and dried before the fire, and they should\r\nbe kept in a dry place, in order that they may escape the deteriorating\r\ninfluence of rust, and, thereby, be destroyed. Copper utensils should\r\nnever be used in the kitchen unless tinned, and the utmost care should\r\nbe taken, not to let the tin be rubbed off. If by chance this should\r\noccur, have it replaced before the vessel is again brought into use.\r\nNeither soup nor gravy should, at any time, be suffered to remain in\r\nthem longer than is absolutely necessary, as any fat or acid that is in\r\nthem, may affect the metal, so as to impregnate with poison what is\r\nintended to be eaten. Stone and earthenware vessels should be provided\r\nfor soups and gravies not intended for immediate use, and, also, plenty\r\nof common dishes for the larder, that the table-set may not be used for\r\nsuch purposes. It is the nature of vegetables soon to turn sour, when\r\nthey are apt to corrode glazed red-ware, and even metals, and\r\nfrequently, thereby, to become impregnated with poisonous particles. The\r\nvinegar also in pickles, by its acidity, does the same. Consideration,\r\ntherefore, should be given to these facts, and great care also taken\r\nthat all _sieves, jelly-bags,_ and tapes for collared articles, be well\r\nscalded and kept dry, or they will impart an unpleasant flavour when\r\nnext used. To all these directions the cook should pay great attention,\r\nnor should they, by any means, be neglected by the _mistress of the\r\nhousehold_, who ought to remember that cleanliness in the kitchen gives\r\nhealth and happiness to home, whilst economy will immeasurably assist in\r\npreserving them.\r\n\r\n73. WITHOUT FUEL, A KITCHEN might be pronounced to be of little use;\r\ntherefore, to discover and invent materials for supplying us with the\r\nmeans of domestic heat and comfort, has exercised the ingenuity of man.\r\nThose now known have been divided into five classes; the first\r\ncomprehending the fluid inflammable bodies; the second, peat or turf;\r\nthe third, charcoal of wood; the fourth, pit-coal charred; and the\r\nfifth, wood or pit-coal in a crude state, with the capacity of yielding\r\na copious and bright flame. The first may be said seldom to be employed\r\nfor the purposes of cookery; but _peat_, especially amongst rural\r\npopulations, has, in all ages, been regarded as an excellent fuel. It is\r\none of the most important productions of an alluvial soil, and belongs\r\nto the vegetable rather than the mineral kingdom. It may be described as\r\ncomposed of wet, spongy black earth, held together by decayed\r\nvegetables. Formerly it covered extensive tracts in England, but has\r\ngreatly disappeared before the genius of agricultural improvement.\r\n_Charcoal_ is a kind of artificial coal, used principally where a strong\r\nand clear fire is desired. It is a black, brittle, insoluble, inodorous,\r\ntasteless substance, and, when newly-made, possesses the remarkable\r\nproperty of absorbing certain quantities of the different gases. Its\r\ndust, when used as a polishing powder, gives great brilliancy to metals.\r\nIt consists of wood half-burned, and is manufactured by cutting pieces\r\nof timber into nearly the same size, then disposing them in heaps, and\r\ncovering them with earth, so as to prevent communication with the air,\r\nexcept when necessary to make them burn. When they have been\r\nsufficiently charred, the fire is extinguished by stopping the vents\r\nthrough which the air is admitted. Of _coal_ there are various species;\r\nas, pit, culm, slate, cannel, Kilkenny, sulphurous, bovey, jet, &c.\r\nThese have all their specific differences, and are employed for various\r\npurposes; but are all, more or less, used as fuel.\r\n\r\n    The use of coal for burning purposes was not known to the\r\n    Romans. In Britain it was discovered about fifty years before\r\n    the birth of Christ, in Lancashire, not tar from where\r\n    Manchester now stands; but for ages after its discovery, so long\r\n    as forests abounded, wood continued to be the fuel used for\r\n    firing. The first public notice of coal is in the reign of Henry\r\n    III., who, in 1272, granted a charter to the town of Newcastle,\r\n    permitting the inhabitants to dig for coal. It took some\r\n    centuries more, however, to bring it into common use, as this\r\n    did not take place till about the first quarter of the\r\n    seventeenth century, in the time of Charles I. A few years after\r\n    the Restoration, we find that about 200,000 chaldrons were\r\n    consumed in London. Although several countries possess mines of\r\n    coal, the quality of their mineral is, in general, greatly\r\n    inferior to that of Great Britain, where it is found mostly in\r\n    undulating districts abounding with valleys, and interspersed\r\n    with plains of considerable extent. It lies usually between the\r\n    _strata_ of other substances, and rarely in an horizontal\r\n    position, but with a _dip_ or inclination to one side. Our cut,\r\n    Fig. 21, represents a section of coal as it is found in the\r\n    stratum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 21.]\r\n\r\n74.

WHEN FUEL AND FOOD ARE PROCURED, the next consideration is, how the\r\nlatter may be best preserved, with a view to its being suitably dressed.\r\nMore waste is often occasioned by the want of judgment, or of necessary\r\ncare in this particular, than by any other cause. In the absence of\r\nproper places for keeping provisions, a hanging safe, suspended in an\r\nairy situation, is the best substitute. A well-ventilated larder, dry\r\nand shady, is better for meat and poultry, which require to be kept for\r\nsome time; and the utmost skill in the culinary art will not compensate\r\nfor the want of proper attention to this particular. Though it is\r\nadvisable that annual food should be hung up in the open air till its\r\nfibres have lost some degree of their toughness, yet, if it is kept till\r\nit loses its natural sweetness, its flavour has become deteriorated,\r\nand, as a wholesome comestible, it has lost many of its qualities\r\nconducive to health. As soon, therefore, as the slightest trace of\r\nputrescence is detected, it has reached its highest degree of\r\ntenderness, and should be dressed immediately. During the sultry summer\r\nmonths, it is difficult to procure meat that is not either tough or\r\ntainted. It should, therefore, be well examined when it comes in, and if\r\nflies have touched it, the part must be cut off, and the remainder well\r\nwashed. In very cold weather, meat and vegetables touched by the frost,\r\nshould be brought into the kitchen early in the morning, and soaked in\r\ncold water. In loins of meat, the long pipe that runs by the bone should\r\nbe taken out, as it is apt to taint; as also the kernels of beef. Rumps\r\nand edgebones of beef, when bruised, should not be purchased. All these\r\nthings ought to enter into the consideration of every household manager,\r\nand great care should be taken that nothing is thrown away, or suffered\r\nto be wasted in the kitchen, which might, by proper management, be\r\nturned to a good account. The shank-bones of mutton, so little esteemed\r\nin general, give richness to soups or gravies, if well soaked and\r\nbrushed before they are added to the boiling. They are also particularly\r\nnourishing for sick persons. Roast-beef bones, or shank-bones of ham,\r\nmake excellent stock for pea-soup.--When the whites of eggs are used for\r\njelly, confectionary, or other purposes, a pudding or a custard should\r\nbe made, that the yolks may be used. All things likely to be wanted\r\nshould be in readiness: sugars of different sorts; currants washed,\r\npicked, and perfectly dry; spices pounded, and kept in very small\r\nbottles closely corked, or in canisters, as we have already directed\r\n(72). Not more of these should be purchased at a time than are likely to\r\nbe used in the course of a month. Much waste is always prevented by\r\nkeeping every article in the place best suited to it. Vegetables keep\r\nbest on a stone floor, if the air be excluded; meat, in a cold dry\r\nplace; as also salt, sugar, sweet-meats, candles, dried meats, and hams.\r\nRice, and all sorts of seed for puddings, should be closely covered to\r\npreserve them from insects; but even this will not prevent them from\r\nbeing affected by these destroyers, if they are long and carelessly\r\nkept.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO COOKERY.\r\n\r\n76. AS IN THE FINE ARTS, the progress of mankind from barbarism to\r\ncivilization is marked by a gradual succession of triumphs over the rude\r\nmaterialities of nature, so in the art of cookery is the progress\r\ngradual from the earliest and simplest modes, to those of the most\r\ncomplicated and refined. Plain or rudely-carved stones, tumuli, or\r\nmounds of earth, are the monuments by which barbarous tribes denote the\r\nevents of their history, to be succeeded, only in the long course of a\r\nseries of ages, by beautifully-proportioned columns, gracefully-sculptured\r\nstatues, triumphal arches, coins, medals, and the higher efforts of the\r\npencil and the pen, as man advances by culture and observation to the\r\nperfection of his facilities. So is it with the art of cookery. Man,\r\nin his primitive state, lives upon roots and the fruits of the earth,\r\nuntil, by degrees, he is driven to seek for new means, by which his\r\nwants may be supplied and enlarged. He then becomes a hunter and a\r\nfisher. As his species increases, greater necessities come upon him,\r\nwhen he gradually abandons the roving life of the savage for the more\r\nstationary pursuits of the herdsman. These beget still more settled\r\nhabits, when he begins the practice of agriculture, forms ideas of the\r\nrights of property, and has his own, both defined and secured. The\r\nforest, the stream, and the sea are now no longer his only resources for\r\nfood. He sows and he reaps, pastures and breeds cattle, lives on the\r\ncultivated produce of his fields, and revels in the luxuries of the\r\ndairy; raises flocks for clothing, and assumes, to all intents and\r\npurposes, the habits of permanent life and the comfortable condition of\r\na farmer. This is the fourth stage of social progress, up to which the\r\nuseful or mechanical arts have been incidentally developing themselves,\r\nwhen trade and commerce begin. Through these various phases, _only to\r\nlive_ has been the great object of mankind; but, by-and-by, comforts are\r\nmultiplied, and accumulating riches create new wants. The object, then,\r\nis not only to _live_, but to live economically, agreeably, tastefully,\r\nand well. Accordingly, the art of cookery commences; and although the\r\nfruits of the earth, the fowls of the air, the beasts of the field, and\r\nthe fish of the sea, are still the only food of mankind, yet these are\r\nso prepared, improved, and dressed by skill and ingenuity, that they are\r\nthe means of immeasurably extending the boundaries of human enjoyments.\r\nEverything that is edible, and passes under the hands of the cook, is\r\nmore or less changed, and assumes new forms. Hence the influence of that\r\nfunctionary is immense upon the happiness of a household.\r\n\r\n77. In order that the duties of the Cook may be properly performed, and\r\nthat he may be able to reproduce esteemed dishes with certainty, all\r\nterms of indecision should be banished from his art. Accordingly, what\r\nis known only to him, will, in these pages, be made known to others. In\r\nthem all those indecisive terms expressed by a bit of this, some of\r\nthat, a small piece of that, and a handful of the other, shall never be\r\nmade use of, but all quantities be precisely and explicitly stated. With\r\na desire, also, that all ignorance on this most essential part of the\r\nculinary art should disappear, and that a uniform system of weights and\r\nmeasures should be adopted, we give an account of the weights which\r\nanswer to certain measures.\r\n\r\nA TABLE-SPOONFUL is frequently mentioned in a recipe, in the\r\nprescriptions of medical men, and also in medical, chemical, and\r\ngastronomical works. By it is generally meant and understood a measure\r\nor bulk equal to that which would be produced by _half an ounce_ of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nA DESSERT-SPOONFUL is the half of a table-spoonful; that is to say, by\r\nit is meant a measure or bulk equal to a _quarter of an ounce_ of water.\r\n\r\nA TEA-SPOONFUL is equal in quantity to a _drachm_ of water.\r\n\r\nA DROP.--This is the name of a vague kind of measure, and is so called\r\non account of the liquid being _dropped_ from the mouth of a bottle. Its\r\nquantity, however, will vary, either from the consistency of the liquid\r\nor the size and shape of the mouth of the bottle. The College of\r\nPhysicians determined the quantity of a drop to be _one grain_, 60 drops\r\nmaking one fluid drachm. Their drop, or sixtieth part of a fluid drachm,\r\nis called a _minim_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig_. 22.]\r\n\r\n    Graduated class measures can be obtained at any chemist's, and\r\n    they save much trouble. One of these, containing a wine pint, is\r\n    divided into 16 oz., and the oz, into 8 drachms of water; by\r\n    which, any certain weight mentioned in a recipe can be\r\n    accurately measured out. Home-made measures of this kind can\r\n    readily be formed by weighing the water contained in any given\r\n    measure, and marking on any tall glass the space it occupies.\r\n    This mark can easily be made with a file. It will be interesting\r\n    to many readers to know the basis on which the French found\r\n    their system of weights and measures, for it certainly possesses\r\n    the grandeur of simplicity. The metre, which is the basis of the\r\n    whole system of French weights and measures, is the exact\r\n    measurement of one forty-millionth part of a meridian of the\r\n    earth.\r\n\r\n78. EXCELLENCE IN THE ART OF COOKERY, as in all other things, is only\r\nattainable by practice and experience. In proportion, therefore, to the\r\nopportunities which a cook has had of these, so will be his excellence\r\nin the art. It is in the large establishments of princes, noblemen, and\r\nvery affluent families alone, that the man cook is found in this\r\ncountry. He, also, superintends the kitchens of large hotels, clubs, and\r\npublic institutions, where he, usually, makes out the bills of fare,\r\nwhich are generally submitted to the principal for approval. To be able\r\nto do this, therefore, it is absolutely necessary that he should be a\r\njudge of the season of every dish, as well as know perfectly the state\r\nof every article he undertakes to prepare. He must also be a judge of\r\nevery article he buys; for no skill, however great it may be, will\r\nenable him to, make that good which is really bad. On him rests the\r\nresponsibility of the cooking generally, whilst a speciality of his\r\ndepartment, is to prepare the rich soups, stews, ragouts, and such\r\ndishes as enter into the more refined and complicated portions of his\r\nart, and such as are not usually understood by ordinary professors. He,\r\ntherefore, holds a high position in a household, being inferior in rank,\r\nas already shown (21), only to the house steward, the valet, and the\r\nbutler.\r\n\r\n    In the luxurious ages of Grecian antiquity, Sicilian cooks were\r\n    the most esteemed, and received high rewards for their services.\r\n    Among them, one called Trimalcio was such an adept in his art,\r\n    that he could impart to common fish both the form and flavour of\r\n    the most esteemed of the piscatory tribes. A chief cook in the\r\n    palmy days of Roman voluptuousness had about £800 a year, and\r\n    Antony rewarded the one that cooked the supper which pleased\r\n    Cleopatra, with the present of a city. With the fall of the\r\n    empire, the culinary art sank into less consideration. In the\r\n    middle ages, cooks laboured to acquire a reputation for their\r\n    sauces, which they composed of strange combinations, for the\r\n    sake of novelty, as well as singularity.\r\n\r\n79. THE DUTIES OF THE COOK, THE KITCHEN AND THE SCULLERY MAIDS, are so\r\nintimately associated, that they can hardly be treated of separately.\r\nThe cook, however, is at the head of the kitchen; and in proportion to\r\nher possession of the qualities of cleanliness, neatness, order,\r\nregularity, and celerity of action, so will her influence appear in the\r\nconduct of those who are under her; as it is upon her that the whole\r\nresponsibility of the business of the kitchen rests, whilst the others\r\nmust lend her, both a ready and a willing assistance, and be especially\r\ntidy in their appearance, and active, in their movements.\r\n\r\n    In the larger establishments of the middle ages, cooks, with the\r\n    authority of feudal chiefs, gave their orders from a high chair\r\n    in which they ensconced themselves, and commanded a view of all\r\n    that was going on throughout their several domains. Each held a\r\n    long wooden spoon, with which he tasted, without leaving his\r\n    seat, the various comestibles that were cooking on the stoves,\r\n    and which he frequently used as a rod of punishment on the backs\r\n    of those whose idleness and gluttony too largely predominated\r\n    over their diligence and temperance.\r\n\r\n80. IF, AS WE HAVE SAID (3), THE QUALITY OF EARLY RISING be of the first\r\nimportance to the mistress, what must it be to the servant! Let it,\r\ntherefore, be taken as a long-proved truism, that without it, in every\r\ndomestic, the effect of all things else, so far as _work_ is concerned,\r\nmay, in a great measure, be neutralized. In a cook, this quality is most\r\nessential; for an hour lost in the morning, will keep her toiling,\r\nabsolutely toiling, all day, to overtake that which might otherwise have\r\nbeen achieved with ease. In large establishments, six is a good hour to\r\nrise in the summer, and seven in the winter.\r\n\r\n81. HER FIRST DUTY, in large establishments and where it is requisite,\r\nshould be to set her dough for the breakfast rolls, provided this has\r\nnot been done on the previous night, and then to engage herself with\r\nthose numerous little preliminary occupations which may not\r\ninappropriately be termed laying out her duties for the day. This will\r\nbring in the breakfast hour of eight, after which, directions must be\r\ngiven, and preparations made, for the different dinners of the household\r\nand family.\r\n\r\n82. IN THOSE NUMEROUS HOUSEHOLDS where a cook and housemaid are only\r\nkept, the general custom is, that the cook should have the charge of the\r\ndining-room. The hall, the lamps and the doorstep are also committed to\r\nher care, and any other work there may be on the outside of the house.\r\nIn establishments of this kind, the cook will, after having lighted her\r\nkitchen fire, carefully brushed the range, and cleaned the hearth,\r\nproceed to prepare for breakfast. She will thoroughly rinse the kettle,\r\nand, filling it with fresh water, will put it on the fire to boil. She\r\nwill then go to the breakfast-room, or parlour, and there make all\r\nthings ready for the breakfast of the family. Her attention will next be\r\ndirected to the hall, which she will sweep and wipe; the kitchen stairs,\r\nif there be any, will now be swept; and the hall mats, which have been\r\nremoved and shaken, will be again put in their places.\r\n\r\n    The cleaning of the kitchen, pantry, passages, and kitchen\r\n    stairs must always be over before breakfast, so that it may not\r\n    interfere with the other business of the day. Everything should\r\n    be ready, and the whole house should wear a comfortable aspect\r\n    when the heads of the house and members of the family make their\r\n    appearance. Nothing, it may be depended on, will so please the\r\n    mistress of an establishment, as to notice that, although she\r\n    has not been present to see that the work was done, attention to\r\n    smaller matters has been carefully paid, with a view to giving\r\n    her satisfaction and increasing her comfort.\r\n\r\n83. BY THE TIME THAT THE COOK has performed the duties mentioned above,\r\nand well swept, brushed, and dusted her kitchen, the breakfast-bell will\r\nmost likely summon her to the parlour, to \"bring in\" the breakfast. It\r\nis the cook's department, generally, in the smaller establishments, to\r\nwait at breakfast, as the housemaid, by this time, has gone up-stairs\r\ninto the bedrooms, and has there applied herself to her various duties.\r\nThe cook usually answers the bells and single knocks at the door in the\r\nearly part of the morning, as the tradesmen, with whom it is her more\r\nspecial business to speak, call at these hours.\r\n\r\n84. IT IS IN HER PREPARATION OF THE DINNER that the cook begins to feel\r\nthe weight and responsibility of her situation, as she must take upon\r\nherself all the dressing and the serving of the principal dishes, which\r\nher skill and ingenuity have mostly prepared. Whilst these, however, are\r\ncooking, she must be busy with her pastry, soups, gravies, ragouts, &c.\r\nStock, or what the French call _consommé_, being the basis of most made\r\ndishes, must be always at hand, in conjunction with her sweet herbs and\r\nspices for seasoning. \"A place for everything, and everything in its\r\nplace,\" must be her rule, in order that time may not be wasted in\r\nlooking for things when they are wanted, and in order that the whole\r\napparatus of cooking may move with the regularity and precision of a\r\nwell-adjusted machine;--all must go on simultaneously. The vegetables\r\nand sauces must be ready with the dishes they are to accompany, and in\r\norder that they may be suitable, the smallest oversight must not be made\r\nin their preparation. When the dinner-hour has arrived, it is the duty\r\nof the cook to dish-up such dishes as may, without injury, stand, for\r\nsome time, covered on the hot plate or in the hot closet; but such as\r\nare of a more important or _recherché_ kind, must be delayed until the\r\norder \"to serve\" is given from the drawing-room. Then comes haste; but\r\nthere must be no hurry,--all must work with order. The cook takes charge\r\nof the fish, soups, and poultry; and the kitchen-maid of the vegetables,\r\nsauces, and gravies. These she puts into their appropriate dishes,\r\nwhilst the scullery-maid waits on and assists the cook. Everything must\r\nbe timed so as to prevent its getting cold, whilst great care should be\r\ntaken, that, between the first and second courses, no more time is\r\nallowed to elapse than is necessary, for fear that the company in the\r\ndining-room lose all relish for what has yet to come of the dinner. When\r\nthe dinner has been served, the most important feature in the daily life\r\nof the cook is at an end. She must, however, now begin to look to the\r\ncontents of her larder, taking care to keep everything sweet and clean,\r\nso that no disagreeable smells may arise from the gravies, milk, or meat\r\nthat may be there. These are the principal duties of a cook in a\r\nfirst-rate establishment.\r\n\r\nIn smaller establishments, the housekeeper often conducts the higher\r\ndepartment of cooking (_see_ 58, 59, 60), and the cook, with the\r\nassistance of a scullery-maid, performs some of the subordinate duties\r\nof the kitchen-maid.\r\n\r\nWhen circumstances render it necessary, the cook engages to perform the\r\nwhole of the work of the kitchen, and, in some places, a portion of the\r\nhouse-work also.\r\n\r\n85. WHILST THE COOK IS ENGAGED WITH HER MORNING DUTIES, the kitchen-maid\r\nis also occupied with hers. Her first duty, after the fire is lighted,\r\nis to sweep and clean the kitchen, and the various offices belonging to\r\nit. This she does every morning, besides cleaning the stone steps at the\r\nentrance of the house, the halls, the passages, and the stairs which\r\nlead to the kitchen. Her general duties, besides these, are to wash and\r\nscour all these places twice a week, with the tables, shelves, and\r\ncupboards. She has also to dress the nursery and servants'-hall dinners,\r\nto prepare all fish, poultry, and vegetables, trim meat joints and\r\ncutlets, and do all such duties as may be considered to enter into the\r\ncook's department in a subordinate degree.\r\n\r\n86. THE DUTIES OF THE SCULLERY-MAID are to assist the cook; to keep the\r\nscullery clean, and all the metallic as well as earthenware kitchen\r\nutensils.\r\n\r\n    The position of scullery-maid is not, of course, one of high\r\n    rank, nor is the payment for her services large. But if she be\r\n    fortunate enough to have over her a good kitchen-maid and clever\r\n    cook, she may very soon learn to perform various little duties\r\n    connected with cooking operations, which may be of considerable\r\n    service in fitting her for a more responsible place. Now, it\r\n    will be doubtless thought by the majority of our readers, that\r\n    the fascinations connected with the position of the\r\n    scullery-maid, are not so great as to induce many people to\r\n    leave a comfortable home in order to work in a scullery. But we\r\n    are acquainted with one instance in which the desire, on the\r\n    part of a young girl, was so strong to become connected with the\r\n    kitchen and cookery, that she absolutely left her parents, and\r\n    engaged herself as a scullery-maid in a gentleman's house. Here\r\n    she showed herself so active and intelligent, that she very\r\n    quickly rose to the rank of kitchen-maid; and from this, so\r\n    great was her gastronomical genius, she became, in a short space\r\n    of time, one of the best women-cooks in England. After this, we\r\n    think, it must be allowed, that a cook, like a poet, _nascitur,\r\n    non fit_.\r\n\r\n87. MODERN COOKERY stands so greatly indebted to the gastronomic\r\npropensities of our French neighbours, that many of their terms are\r\nadopted and applied by English artists to the same as well as similar\r\npreparations of their own. A vocabulary of these is, therefore,\r\nindispensable in a work of this kind. Accordingly, the following will be\r\nfound sufficiently complete for all ordinary purposes:--\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF FRENCH TERMS USED IN MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY.\r\n\r\nASPIC.--A savoury jelly, used as an exterior moulding for cold game,\r\npoultry, fish, &c. This, being of a transparent nature, allows the bird\r\nwhich it covers to be seen through it. This may also be used for\r\ndecorating or garnishing.\r\n\r\nASSIETTE (plate).--_Assiettes_ are the small _entrées_ and\r\n_hors-d'oeuvres_, the quantity of which does not exceed what a plate\r\nwill hold. At dessert, fruits, cheese, chestnuts, biscuits, &c., if\r\nserved upon a plate, are termed _assiettes_.--ASSIETTE VOLANTE is a\r\ndish which a servant hands round to the guests, but is not placed upon\r\nthe table. Small cheese soufflés and different dishes, which ought to be\r\nserved very hot, are frequently made _assielles volantes_.\r\n\r\nAU-BLEU.--Fish dressed in such a manner as to have a _bluish_\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nBAIN-MARIE.--An open saucepan or kettle of nearly boiling water, in\r\nwhich a smaller vessel can be set for cooking and warming. This is very\r\nuseful for keeping articles hot, without altering their quantity or\r\nquality. If you keep sauce, broth, or soup by the fireside, the soup\r\nreduces and becomes too strong, and the sauce thickens as well as\r\nreduces; but this is prevented by using the _bain-marie_, in which the\r\nwater should be very hot, but not boiling.\r\n\r\nBÉCHAMEL.--French white sauce, now frequently used in English cookery.\r\n\r\nBLANCH.--To whiten poultry, vegetables, fruit, &c., by plunging them\r\ninto boiling water for a short time, and afterwards plunging them into\r\ncold water, there to remain until they are cold.\r\n\r\nBLANQUETTE.--A sort of fricassee.\r\n\r\nBOUILLI.--Beef or other meat boiled; but, generally speaking, boiled\r\nbeef is understood by the term.\r\n\r\nBOUILLIE.--A French dish resembling hasty-pudding.\r\n\r\nBOUILLON.--A thin broth or soup.\r\n\r\nBRAISE.--To stew meat with fat bacon until it is tender, it having\r\npreviously been blanched.\r\n\r\nBRAISIÈRE.--A saucepan having a lid with ledges, to put fire on the top.\r\n\r\nBRIDER.--To pass a packthread through poultry, game, &c., to keep\r\ntogether their members.\r\n\r\nCARAMEL (burnt sugar).--This is made with a piece of sugar, of the size\r\nof a nut, browned in the bottom of a saucepan; upon which a cupful of\r\nstock is gradually poured, stirring all the time a glass of broth,\r\nlittle by little. It may be used with the feather of a quill, to colour\r\nmeats, such as the upper part of fricandeaux; and to impart colour to\r\nsauces. Caramel made with water instead of stock may be used to colour\r\n_compôtes_ and other _entremets_.\r\n\r\nCASSEROLE.--A crust of rice, which, after having been moulded into the\r\nform of a pie, is baked, and then filled with a fricassee of white meat\r\nor a purée of game.\r\n\r\nCOMPOTE.--A stew, as of fruit or pigeons.\r\n\r\nCONSOMMÉ.--Rich stock, or gravy.\r\n\r\nCROQUETTE.--Ball of fried rice or potatoes.\r\n\r\nCROUTONS.--Sippets of bread.\r\n\r\nDAUBIÈRE.--An oval stewpan, in which _daubes_ are cooked; _daubes_ being\r\nmeat or fowl stewed in sauce.\r\n\r\nDÉSOSSER.--To _bone_, or take out the bones from poultry, game, or fish.\r\nThis is an operation requiring considerable experience.\r\n\r\nENTRÉES.--Small side or corner dishes, served with the first course.\r\n\r\nENTREMETS.--Small side or corner dishes, served with the second course.\r\n\r\nESCALOPES.--Collops; small, round, thin pieces of tender meat, or of\r\nfish, beaten with the handle of a strong knife to make them tender.\r\n\r\nFEUILLETAGE.--Puff-paste.\r\n\r\nFLAMBER.--To singe fowl or game, after they have been picked.\r\n\r\nFONCER.--To put in the bottom of a saucepan slices of ham, veal, or thin\r\nbroad slices of bacon.\r\n\r\nGALETTE.--A broad thin cake.\r\n\r\nGÂTEAU.--A cake, correctly speaking; but used sometimes to denote a\r\npudding and a kind of tart.\r\n\r\nGLACER.--To glaze, or spread upon hot meats, or larded fowl, a thick and\r\nrich sauce or gravy, called _glaze_. This is laid on with a feather or\r\nbrush, and in confectionary the term means to ice fruits and pastry with\r\nsugar, which glistens on hardening.\r\n\r\nHORS-D'OEUVRES.--Small dishes, or _assiettes volantes_ of sardines,\r\nanchovies, and other relishes of this kind, served to the guests during\r\nthe first course. (_See_ ASSIETTES VOLANTES.)\r\n\r\nLIT.--A bed or layer; articles in thin slices are placed in layers,\r\nother articles, or seasoning, being laid between them.\r\n\r\nMAIGRE.--Broth, soup, or gravy, made without meat.\r\n\r\nMATELOTE.--A rich fish-stew, which is generally composed of carp, eels,\r\ntrout, or barbel. It is made with wine.\r\n\r\nMAYONNAISE.--Cold sauce, or salad dressing.\r\n\r\nMENU.--The bill of fare.\r\n\r\nMERINGUE.--A kind of icing, made of whites of eggs and sugar, well\r\nbeaten.\r\n\r\nMIROTON.--Larger slices of meat than collops; such as slices of beef for\r\na vinaigrette, or ragout or stew of onions.\r\n\r\nMOUILLER.--To add water, broth, or other liquid, during the cooking.\r\n\r\nPANER.--To cover over with very fine crumbs of bread, meats, or any\r\nother articles to be cooked on the gridiron, in the oven, or frying-pan.\r\n\r\nPIQUER.--To lard with strips of fat bacon, poultry, game, meat, &c. This\r\nshould always be done according to the vein of the meat, so that in\r\ncarving you slice the bacon across as well as the meat.\r\n\r\nPOÊLÉE.--Stock used instead of water for boiling turkeys, sweetbreads,\r\nfowls, and vegetables, to render them less insipid. This is rather an\r\nexpensive preparation.\r\n\r\nPURÉE.--Vegetables, or meat reduced to a very smooth pulp, which is\r\nafterwards mixed with enough liquid to make it of the consistency of\r\nvery thick soup.\r\n\r\nRAGOUT.--Stew or hash.\r\n\r\nREMOULADE.--Salad dressing.\r\n\r\nRISSOLES.--Pastry, made of light puff-paste, and cut into various forms,\r\nand fried. They may be filled with fish, meat, or sweets.\r\n\r\nROUX.--Brown and white; French thickening.\r\n\r\nSALMI.--Ragout of game previously roasted.\r\n\r\nSAUCE PIQUANTE.--A sharp sauce, in which somewhat of a vinegar flavour\r\npredominates.\r\n\r\nSAUTER.--To dress with sauce in a saucepan, repeatedly moving it about.\r\n\r\nTAMIS.--Tammy, a sort of open cloth or sieve through which to strain\r\nbroth and sauces, so as to rid them of small bones, froth, &c.\r\n\r\nTOURTE.--Tart. Fruit pie.\r\n\r\nTROUSSER.--To truss a bird; to put together the body and tie the wings\r\nand thighs, in order to round it for roasting or boiling, each being\r\ntied then with packthread, to keep it in the required form.\r\n\r\nVOL-AU-VENT.--A rich crust of very fine puff-paste, which may be filled\r\nwith various delicate ragouts or fricassees, of fish, flesh, or fowl.\r\nFruit may also be inclosed in a _vol-au-vent_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSOUPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING SOUPS.\r\n\r\n88. LEAN, JUICY BEEF, MUTTON, AND VEAL, form the basis of all good\r\nsoups; therefore it is advisable to procure those pieces which afford\r\nthe richest succulence, and such as are fresh-killed. Stale meat renders\r\nthem bad, and fat is not so well adapted for making them. The principal\r\nart in composing good rich soup, is so to proportion the several\r\ningredients that the flavour of one shall not predominate over another,\r\nand that all the articles of which it is composed, shall form an\r\nagreeable whole. To accomplish this, care must be taken that the roots\r\nand herbs are perfectly well cleaned, and that the water is proportioned\r\nto the quantity of meat and other ingredients. Generally a quart of\r\nwater may be allowed to a pound of meat for soups, and half the quantity\r\nfor gravies. In making soups or gravies, gentle stewing or simmering is\r\nincomparably the best. It may be remarked, however, that a really good\r\nsoup can never be made but in a well-closed vessel, although, perhaps,\r\ngreater wholesomeness is obtained by an occasional exposure to the air.\r\nSoups will, in general, take from three to six hours doing, and are much\r\nbetter prepared the day before they are wanted. When the soup is cold,\r\nthe fat may be much more easily and completely removed; and when it is\r\npoured off, care must be taken not to disturb the settlings at the\r\nbottom of the vessel, which are so fine that they will escape through a\r\nsieve. A tamis is the best strainer, and if the soup is strained while\r\nit is hot, let the tamis or cloth be previously soaked in cold water.\r\nClear soups must be perfectly transparent, and thickened soups about the\r\nconsistence of cream. To thicken and give body to soups and gravies,\r\npotato-mucilage, arrow-root, bread-raspings, isinglass, flour and\r\nbutter, barley, rice, or oatmeal, in a little water rubbed well\r\ntogether, are used. A piece of boiled beef pounded to a pulp, with a bit\r\nof butter and flour, and rubbed through a sieve, and gradually\r\nincorporated with the soup, will be found an excellent addition. When\r\nthe soup appears to be _too thin_ or _too weak_, the cover of the boiler\r\nshould be taken off, and the contents allowed to boil till some of the\r\nwatery parts have evaporated; or some of the thickening materials, above\r\nmentioned, should be added. When soups and gravies are kept from day to\r\nday in hot weather, they should be warmed up every day, and put into\r\nfresh scalded pans or tureens, and placed in a cool cellar. In temperate\r\nweather, every other day may be sufficient.\r\n\r\n89. VARIOUS HERBS AND VEGETABLES are required for the purpose of making\r\nsoups and gravies. Of these the principal are,--Scotch barley, pearl\r\nbarley, wheat flour, oatmeal, bread-raspings, pease, beans, rice,\r\nvermicelli, macaroni, isinglass, potato-mucilage, mushroom or mushroom\r\nketchup, champignons, parsnips, carrots, beetroot, turnips, garlic,\r\nshalots, and onions. Sliced onions, fried with butter and flour till\r\nthey are browned, and then rubbed through a sieve, are excellent to\r\nheighten the colour and flavour of brown soups and sauces, and form the\r\nbasis of many of the fine relishes furnished by the cook. The older and\r\ndrier the onion, the stronger will be its flavour. Leeks, cucumber, or\r\nburnet vinegar; celery or celery-seed pounded. The latter, though\r\nequally strong, does not impart the delicate sweetness of the fresh\r\nvegetable; and when used as a substitute, its flavour should be\r\ncorrected by the addition of a bit of sugar. Cress-seed, parsley, common\r\nthyme, lemon thyme, orange thyme, knotted marjoram, sage, mint, winter\r\nsavoury, and basil. As fresh green basil is seldom to be procured, and\r\nits fine flavour is soon lost, the best way of preserving the extract is\r\nby pouring wine on the fresh leaves.\r\n\r\n90. FOR THE SEASONING OF SOUPS, bay-leaves, tomato, tarragon, chervil,\r\nburnet, allspice, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, clove, mace, black and white\r\npepper, essence of anchovy, lemon-peel, and juice, and Seville\r\norange-juice, are all taken. The latter imparts a finer flavour than the\r\nlemon, and the acid is much milder. These materials, with wine, mushroom\r\nketchup, Harvey's sauce, tomato sauce, combined in various proportions,\r\nare, with other ingredients, manipulated into an almost endless variety\r\nof excellent soups and gravies. Soups, which are intended to constitute\r\nthe principal part of a meal, certainly ought not to be flavoured like\r\nsauces, which are only designed to give a relish to some particular\r\ndish.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUP, BROTH AND BOUILLON.\r\n\r\n91. IT HAS BEEN ASSERTED, that English cookery is, nationally speaking,\r\nfar from being the best in the world. More than this, we have been\r\nfrequently told by brilliant foreign writers, half philosophers, half\r\n_chefs_, that we are the _worst_ cooks on the face of the earth, and\r\nthat the proverb which alludes to the divine origin of food, and the\r\nprecisely opposite origin of its preparers, is peculiarly applicable to\r\nus islanders. Not, however, to the inhabitants of the whole island; for,\r\nit is stated in a work which treats of culinary operations, north of the\r\nTweed, that the \"broth\" of Scotland claims, for excellence and\r\nwholesomeness, a very close second place to the _bouillon_, or common\r\nsoup of France. \"_Three_ hot meals of broth and meat, for about the\r\nprice of ONE roasting joint,\" our Scottish brothers and sisters get,\r\nthey say; and we hasten to assent to what we think is now a very\r\nwell-ascertained fact. We are glad to note, however, that soups of\r\nvegetables, fish, meat, and game, are now very frequently found in the\r\nhomes of the English middle classes, as well as in the mansions of the\r\nwealthier and more aristocratic; and we take this to be one evidence,\r\nthat we are on the right road to an improvement in our system of\r\ncookery. One great cause of many of the spoilt dishes and badly-cooked\r\nmeats which are brought to our tables, arises, we think, and most will\r\nagree with us, from a non-acquaintance with \"common, every-day things.\"\r\nEntertaining this view, we intend to preface the chapters of this work\r\nwith a simple scientific _résumé_ of all those causes and circumstances\r\nwhich relate to the food we have to prepare, and the theory and\r\nchemistry of the various culinary operations. Accordingly, this is the\r\nproper place to treat of the quality of the flesh of animals, and\r\ndescribe some of the circumstances which influence it for good or bad.\r\nWe will, therefore, commence with the circumstance of _age_, and examine\r\nhow far this affects the quality of meat.\r\n\r\n92. DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE BIRTH AND MATURITY OF ANIMALS, their\r\nflesh undergoes very considerable changes. For instance, when the animal\r\nis young, the fluids which the tissues of the muscles contain, possess a\r\nlarge proportion of what is called _albumen_. This albumen, which is\r\nalso the chief component of the white of eggs, possesses the peculiarity\r\nof coagulating or hardening at a certain temperature, like the white of\r\na boiled egg, into a soft, white fluid, no longer soluble, or capable of\r\nbeing dissolved in water. As animals grow older, this peculiar animal\r\nmatter gradually decreases, in proportion to the other constituents of\r\nthe juice of the flesh. Thus, the reason why veal, lamb, and young pork\r\nare _white, and without gravy_ when cooked, is, that the large quantity\r\nof albumen they contain hardens, or becomes coagulated. On the other\r\nhand, the reason why beef and mutton are _brown, and have gravy_, is,\r\nthat the proportion of albumen they contain, is small, in comparison\r\nwith their greater quantity of fluid which is soluble, and not\r\ncoagulable.\r\n\r\n93. THE QUALITY OF THE FLESH OF AN ANIMAL is considerably influenced by\r\nthe nature of the _food on which it has been fed_; for the food supplies\r\nthe material which produces the flesh. If the food be not suitable and\r\ngood, the meat cannot be good either; just as the paper on which these\r\nwords are printed, could not be good, if the rags from which it is made,\r\nwere not of a fine quality. To the experienced in this matter, it is\r\nwell known that the flesh of animals fed on farinaceous produce, such as\r\ncorn, pulse, &c., is firm, well-flavoured, and also economical in the\r\ncooking; that the flesh of those fed on succulent and pulpy substances,\r\nsuch as roots, possesses these qualities in a somewhat less degree;\r\nwhilst the flesh of those whose food contains fixed oil, as linseed, is\r\ngreasy, high coloured, and gross in the fat, and if the food has been\r\nused in large quantities, possessed of a rank flavour.\r\n\r\n94. IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO THE GOOD QUALITY OF MEAT, that the animal\r\nshould be _perfectly healthy_ at the time of its slaughter. However\r\nslight the disease in an animal may be, inferiority in the quality of\r\nits flesh, as food, is certain to be produced. In most cases, indeed, as\r\nthe flesh of diseased animals has a tendency to very rapid putrefaction,\r\nit becomes not only unwholesome, but absolutely poisonous, on account of\r\nthe absorption of the _virus_ of the unsound meat into the systems of\r\nthose who partake of it. The external indications of good and bad meat\r\nwill be described under its own particular head, but we may here premise\r\nthat the layer of all wholesome meat, when freshly killed, adheres\r\nfirmly to the bone.\r\n\r\n95. ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE GREATLY AFFECTING THE QUALITY OF MEAT, is the\r\nanimal's treatment _before it is slaughtered_. This influences its value\r\nand wholesomeness in no inconsiderable degree. It will be easy to\r\nunderstand this, when we reflect on those leading principles by which\r\nthe life of an animal is supported and maintained. These are, the\r\ndigestion of its food, and the assimilation of that food into its\r\nsubstance. Nature, in effecting this process, first reduces the food in\r\nthe stomach to a state of pulp, under the name of chyme, which passes\r\ninto the intestines, and is there divided into two principles, each\r\ndistinct from the other. One, a milk-white fluid,--the nutritive\r\nportion,--is absorbed by innumerable vessels which open upon the mucous\r\nmembrane, or inner coat of the intestines. These vessels, or absorbents,\r\ndischarge the fluid into a common duct, or road, along which it is\r\nconveyed to the large veins in the neighbourhood of the heart. Here it\r\nis mixed with the venous blood (which is black and impure) returning\r\nfrom every part of the body, and then it supplies the waste which is\r\noccasioned in the circulating stream by the arterial (or pure) blood\r\nhaving furnished matter for the substance of the animal. The blood of\r\nthe animal having completed its course through all parts, and having had\r\nits waste recruited by the digested food, is now received into the\r\nheart, and by the action of that organ it is urged through the lungs,\r\nthere to receive its purification from the air which the animal inhales.\r\nAgain returning to the heart, it is forced through the arteries, and\r\nthence distributed, by innumerable ramifications, called capillaries,\r\nbestowing to every part of the animal, life and nutriment. The other\r\nprinciple--the innutritive portion--passes from the intestines, and is\r\nthus got rid of. It will now be readily understood how flesh is affected\r\nfor bad, if an animal is slaughtered when the circulation of its blood\r\nhas been increased by over-driving, ill-usage, or other causes of\r\nexcitement, to such a degree of rapidity as to be too great for the\r\ncapillaries to perform their functions, and causing the blood to be\r\ncongealed in its minuter vessels. Where this has been the case, the meat\r\nwill be dark-coloured, and become rapidly putrid; so that self-interest\r\nand humanity alike dictate kind and gentle treatment of all animals\r\ndestined to serve as food for man.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMISTRY AND ECONOMY OF SOUP-MAKING.\r\n\r\n96. STOCK BEING THE BASIS of all meat soups, and, also, of all the\r\nprincipal sauces, it is essential to the success of these culinary\r\noperations, to know the most complete and economical method of\r\nextracting, from a certain quantity of meat, the best possible stock or\r\nbroth. The theory and philosophy of this process we will, therefore,\r\nexplain, and then proceed to show the practical course to be adopted.\r\n\r\n97. AS ALL MEAT is principally composed of fibres, fat, gelatine,\r\nosmazome, and albumen, it is requisite to know that the FIBRES are\r\ninseparable, constituting almost all that remains of the meat after it\r\nhas undergone a long boiling.\r\n\r\n98. FAT is dissolved by boiling; but as it is contained in cells covered\r\nby a very fine membrane, which never dissolves, a portion of it always\r\nadheres to the fibres. The other portion rises to the surface of the\r\nstock, and is that which has escaped from the cells which were not\r\nwhole, or which have burst by boiling.\r\n\r\n99. GELATINE is soluble: it is the basis and the nutritious portion of\r\nthe stock. When there is an abundance of it, it causes the stock, when\r\ncold, to become a jelly.\r\n\r\n100. OSMAZOME is soluble even when cold, and is that part of the meat\r\nwhich gives flavour and perfume to the stock. The flesh of old animals\r\ncontains more _osmazome_ than that of young ones. Brown meats contain\r\nmore than white, and the former make the stock more fragrant. By\r\nroasting meat, the osmazome appears to acquire higher properties; so, by\r\nputting the remains of roast meats into your stock-pot, you obtain a\r\nbetter flavour.\r\n\r\n101. ALBUMEN is of the nature of the white of eggs; it can be dissolved\r\nin cold or tepid water, but coagulates when it is put into water not\r\nquite at the boiling-point. From this property in albumen, it is evident\r\nthat if the meat is put into the stock-pot when the water boils, or\r\nafter this is made to boil up quickly, the albumen, in both cases,\r\nhardens. In the first it rises to the surface, in the second it remains\r\nin the meat, but in both it prevents the gelatine and osmazome from\r\ndissolving; and hence a thin and tasteless stock will be obtained. It\r\nought to be known, too, that the coagulation of the albumen in the meat,\r\nalways takes place, more or less, according to the size of the piece, as\r\nthe parts farthest from the surface always acquire _that degree_ of heat\r\nwhich congeals it before entirely dissolving it.\r\n\r\n102. BONES ought always to form a component part of the stock-pot. They\r\nare composed of an earthy substance,--to which they owe their\r\nsolidity,--of gelatine, and a fatty fluid, something like marrow. _Two\r\nounces_ of them contain as much gelatine as _one pound_ of meat; but in\r\nthem, this is so incased in the earthy substance, that boiling water can\r\ndissolve only the surface of whole bones. By breaking them, however, you\r\ncan dissolve more, because you multiply their surfaces; and by reducing\r\nthem to powder or paste, you can dissolve them entirely; but you must\r\nnot grind them dry. We have said (99) that gelatine forms the basis of\r\nstock; but this, though very nourishing, is entirely without taste; and\r\nto make the stock savoury, it must contain _osmazome_. Of this, bones do\r\nnot contain a particle; and that is the reason why stock made entirely\r\nof them, is not liked; but when you add meat to the broken or pulverized\r\nbones, the osmazome contained in it makes the stock sufficiently\r\nsavoury.\r\n\r\n103. In concluding this part of our subject, the following condensed\r\nhints and directions should be attended to in the economy of\r\nsoup-making:--\r\n\r\nI. BEEF MAKES THE BEST STOCK; veal stock has less colour and taste;\r\nwhilst mutton sometimes gives it a tallowy smell, far from agreeable,\r\nunless the meat has been previously roasted or broiled. Fowls add very\r\nlittle to the flavour of stock, unless they be old and fat. Pigeons,\r\nwhen they are old, add the most flavour to it; and a rabbit or partridge\r\nis also a great improvement. From the freshest meat the best stock is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nII. IF THE MEAT BE BOILED solely to make stock, it must be cut up into\r\nthe smallest possible pieces; but, generally speaking, if it is desired\r\nto have good stock and a piece of savoury meat as well, it is necessary\r\nto put a rather large piece into the stock-pot, say sufficient for two\r\nor three days, during which time the stock will keep well in all\r\nweathers. Choose the freshest meat, and have it cut as thick as\r\npossible; for if it is a thin, flat piece, it will not look well, and\r\nwill be very soon spoiled by the boiling.\r\n\r\nIII. NEVER WASH MEAT, as it deprives its surface of all its juices;\r\nseparate it from the bones, and tie it round with tape, so that its\r\nshape may be preserved, then put it into the stock-pot, and for each\r\npound of meat, let there be one pint of water; press it down with the\r\nhand, to allow the air, which it contains, to escape, and which often\r\nraises it to the top of the water.\r\n\r\nIV. PUT THE STOCK-POT ON A GENTLE FIRE, so that it may heat gradually.\r\nThe albumen will first dissolve, afterwards coagulate; and as it is in\r\nthis state lighter than the liquid, it will rise to the surface;\r\nbringing with it all its impurities. It is this which makes _the scum_.\r\nThe rising of the hardened albumen has the same effect in clarifying\r\nstock as the white of eggs; and, as a rule, it may be said that the more\r\nscum there is, the clearer will be the stock. Always take care that the\r\nfire is very regular.\r\n\r\nV. REMOVE THE SCUM when it rises thickly, and do not let the stock boil,\r\nbecause then one portion of the scum will be dissolved, and the other go\r\nto the bottom of the pot; thus rendering it very difficult to obtain a\r\nclear broth. If the fire is regular, it will not be necessary to add\r\ncold water in order to make the scum rise; but if the fire is too large\r\nat first, it will then be necessary to do so.\r\n\r\nVI. WHEN THE STOCK IS WELL SKIMMED, and begins to boil, put in salt and\r\nvegetables, which may be two or three carrots, two turnips, one parsnip,\r\na bunch of leeks and celery tied together. You can add, according to\r\ntaste, a piece of cabbage, two or three cloves stuck in an onion, and a\r\ntomato. The latter gives a very agreeable flavour to the stock. If fried\r\nonion be added, it ought, according to the advice of a famous French\r\n_chef_, to be tied in a little bag: without this precaution, the colour\r\nof the stock is liable to be clouded.\r\n\r\nVII. BY THIS TIME we will now suppose that you have chopped the bones\r\nwhich were separated from the meat, and those which were left from the\r\nroast meat of the day before. Remember, as was before pointed out, that\r\nthe more these are broken, the more gelatine you will have. The best way\r\nto break them up is to pound them roughly in an iron mortar, adding,\r\nfrom time to time, a little water, to prevent them getting heated. It is\r\na great saving thus to make use of the bones of meat, which, in too many\r\nEnglish families, we fear, are entirely wasted; for it is certain, as\r\npreviously stated (No. 102), that two ounces of bone contain as much\r\ngelatine (which is the nutritive portion of stock) as one pound of meat.\r\nIn their broken state tie them up in a bag, and put them in the\r\nstock-pot; adding the gristly parts of cold meat, and trimmings, which\r\ncan be used for no other purpose. If, to make up the weight, you have\r\nreceived from the butcher a piece of mutton or veal, broil it slightly\r\nover a clear fire before putting it in the stock-pot, and be very\r\ncareful that it does not contract the least taste of being smoked or\r\nburnt.\r\n\r\nVIII. ADD NOW THE VEGETABLES, which, to a certain extent, will stop the\r\nboiling of the stock. Wait, therefore, till it simmers well up again,\r\nthen draw it to the side of the fire, and keep it gently simmering till\r\nit is served, preserving, as before said, your fire always the same.\r\nCover the stock-pot well, to prevent evaporation; do not fill it up,\r\neven if you take out a little stock, unless the meat is exposed; in\r\nwhich case a little boiling water may be added, but only enough to cover\r\nit. After six hours' slow and gentle simmering, the stock is done; and\r\nit should not be continued on the fire, longer than is necessary, or it\r\nwill tend to insipidity.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--It is on a good stock, or first good broth and sauce, that\r\nexcellence in cookery depends. If the preparation of this basis of the\r\nculinary art is intrusted to negligent or ignorant persons, and the\r\nstock is not well skimmed, but indifferent results will be obtained. The\r\nstock will never be clear; and when it is obliged to be clarified, it is\r\ndeteriorated both in quality and flavour. In the proper management of\r\nthe stock-pot an immense deal of trouble is saved, inasmuch as one\r\nstock, in a small dinner, serves for all purposes. Above all things, the\r\ngreatest economy, consistent with excellence, should be practised, and\r\nthe price of everything which enters the kitchen correctly ascertained.\r\nThe _theory_ of this part of Household Management may appear trifling;\r\nbut its practice is extensive, and therefore it requires the best\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT AND VEGETABLE SOUPS.\r\n\r\n[_It will be seen, by reference to the following Recipes, that an\r\nentirely original and most intelligible system has been pursued in\r\nexplaining the preparation of each dish. We would recommend the young\r\nhousekeeper, cook, or whoever may be engaged in the important task of\r\n\"getting ready\" the dinner, or other meal, to follow precisely the order\r\nin which the recipes are given. Thus, let them first place on their\r\ntable all the INGREDIENTS necessary; then the modus operandi, or MODE of\r\npreparation, will be easily managed. By a careful reading, too, of the\r\nrecipes, there will not be the slightest difficulty in arranging a\r\nrepast for any number of persons, and an accurate notion will be gained\r\nof the TIME the cooling of each dish will occupy, of the periods at\r\nwhich it is SEASONABLE, as also of its_ AVERAGE COST.\r\n\r\n_The addition of the natural history, and the description of the various\r\nproperties of the edible articles in common use in every family, will be\r\nserviceable both in a practical and an educational point of view._\r\n\r\n_Speaking specially of the Recipes for Soups, it may be added, that by\r\nthe employment of the_ BEST, MEDIUM, _or_ COMMON STOCK, _the quality of\r\nthe Soups and their cost may be proportionately increased or lessened._]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOCKS FOR ALL KINDS OF SOUPS.\r\n\r\nRICH STRONG STOCK.\r\n\r\n104. INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs. of shin of beef, 4 lbs. of knuckle of veal,\r\n3/4 lb. of good lean ham; any poultry trimmings; 3 small onions, 3 small\r\ncarrots, 3 turnips (the latter should be omitted in summer, lest they\r\nferment), 1 head of celery, a few chopped mushrooms, when obtainable; 1\r\ntomato, a bunch of savoury herbs, not forgetting parsley; 1-1/2 oz. of\r\nsalt, 12 white peppercorns, 6 cloves, 3 small blades of mace, 4 quarts\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Line a delicately clean stewpan with the ham cut in thin broad\r\nslices, carefully trimming off all its rusty fat; cut up the beef and\r\nveal in pieces about 3 inches square, and lay them on the ham; set it on\r\nthe stove, and draw it down, and stir frequently. When the meat is\r\nequally browned, put in the beef and veal bones, the poultry trimmings,\r\nand pour in the cold water. Skim well, and occasionally add a little\r\ncold water, to stop its boiling, until it becomes quite clear; then put\r\nin all the other ingredients, and simmer very slowly for 5 hours. Do not\r\nlet it come to a brisk boil, that the stock be not wasted, and that its\r\ncolour may be preserved. Strain through a very fine hair sieve, or\r\ntammy, and it will be fit for use.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 3d. per quart.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDIUM STOCK.\r\n\r\n105. INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs. of shin of beef, or 4 lbs. of knuckle of veal,\r\nor 2 lbs. of each; any bones, trimmings of poultry, or fresh meat, 1/2 a\r\nlb. of lean bacon or ham, 2 oz. of butter, 2 large onions, each stuck\r\nwith 3 cloves; 1 turnip, 3 carrots, 1/2 a leek, 1 head of celery, 2 oz.\r\nof salt, 1/2 a teaspoonful of whole pepper, 1 large blade of mace, 1\r\nsmall bunch of savoury herbs, 4 quarts and 1/2 pint of cold water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the meat and bacon or ham into pieces about 3 inches\r\nsquare; rub the butter on the bottom of the stewpan; put in 1/2 a pint\r\nof water, the meat, and all the other ingredients. Cover the stewpan,\r\nand place it on a sharp fire, occasionally stirring its contents. When\r\nthe bottom of the pan becomes covered with a pale, jelly-like substance,\r\nadd 4 quarts of cold water, and simmer very gently for 5 hours. As we\r\nhave said before, do not let it boil quickly. Skim off every particle of\r\ngrease whilst it is doing, and strain it through a fine hair sieve.\r\n\r\nThis is the basis of many of the soups afterwards mentioned, and will be\r\nfound quite strong enough for ordinary purposes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 9d. per quart.\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMICAL STOCK.\r\n\r\n106. INGREDIENTS.--The liquor in which a joint of meat has been boiled,\r\nsay 4 quarts; trimmings of fresh meat or poultry, shank-bones, &c.,\r\nroast-beef bones, any pieces the larder may furnish; vegetables, spices,\r\nand the same seasoning as in the foregoing recipe.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let all the ingredients simmer gently for 6 hours, taking care\r\nto skim carefully at first. Strain it off, and put by for use.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--6 hours. _Average cost_, 3d. per quart.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE STOCK.\r\n\r\n(_To be Used in the Preparation of White Soups_.)\r\n\r\n107. INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs. of knuckle of veal, any poultry trimmings, 4\r\nslices of lean ham, 1 carrot, 2 onions, 1 head of celery, 12 white\r\npeppercorns, 1 oz. of salt, 1 blade of mace, 1 oz. butter, 4 quarts of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the veal, and put it with the bones and trimmings of\r\npoultry, and the ham, into the stewpan, which has been rubbed with the\r\nbutter. Moisten with 1/2 a pint of water, and simmer till the gravy\r\nbegins to flow. Then add the 4 quarts of water and the remainder of the\r\ningredients; simmer for 5 hours. After skimming and straining it\r\ncarefully through a very fine hair sieve, it will be ready for use.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 9d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--When stronger stock is desired, double the quantity of veal, or\r\nput in an old fowl. The liquor in which a young turkey has been boiled,\r\nis an excellent addition to all white stock or soups.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWNING FOR STOCK.\r\n\r\n108. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of powdered sugar, and 1/2 a pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Place the sugar in a stewpan over a slow fire until it begins\r\nto melt, keeping it stirred with a wooden spoon until it becomes black,\r\nthen add the water, and let it dissolve. Cork closely, and use a few\r\ndrops when required.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--In France, burnt onions are made use of for the purpose of\r\nbrowning. As a general rule, the process of browning is to be\r\ndiscouraged, as apt to impart a slightly unpleasant flavour to the\r\nstock, and, consequently, all soups made from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CLARIFY STOCK.\r\n\r\n109. INGREDIENTS.--The whites of 2 eggs, 1/2 pint of water, 2 quarts of\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Supposing that by some accident the soup is not quite clear,\r\nand that its quantity is 2 quarts, take the whites of 2 eggs, carefully\r\nseparated from their yolks, whisk them well together with the water, and\r\nadd gradually the 2 quarts of boiling stock, still whisking. Place the\r\nsoup on the fire, and when boiling and well skimmed, whisk the eggs with\r\nit till nearly boiling again; then draw it from the fire, and let it\r\nsettle, until the whites of the eggs become separated. Pass through a\r\nfine cloth, and the soup should be clear.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The rule is, that all clear soups should be of a light straw\r\ncolour, and should not savour too strongly of the meat; and that all\r\nwhite or brown thick soups should have no more consistency than will\r\nenable them to adhere slightly to the spoon when hot. All _purées_\r\nshould be somewhat thicker.\r\n\r\n\r\nALMOND SOUP.\r\n\r\n110. INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs. of lean beef or veal, 1/2 a scrag of mutton, 1\r\noz. of vermicelli, 4 blades of mace, 6 cloves, 1/2 lb. of sweet almonds,\r\nthe yolks of 6 eggs, 1 gill of thick cream, rather more than 2 quarts of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the beef, or veal, and the mutton, gently in water that\r\nwill cover them, till the gravy is very strong, and the meat very\r\ntender; then strain off the gravy, and set it on the fire with the\r\nspecified quantities of vermicelli, mace, and cloves, to 2 quarts. Let\r\nit boil till it has the flavour of the spices. Have ready the almonds,\r\nblanched and pounded very fine; the yolks of the eggs boiled hard;\r\nmixing the almonds, whilst pounding, with a little of the soup, lest the\r\nlatter should grow oily. Pound them till they are a mere pulp, and keep\r\nadding to them, by degrees, a little soup until they are thoroughly\r\nmixed together. Let the soup be cool when mixing, and do it perfectly\r\nsmooth. Strain it through a sieve, set it on the fire, stir frequently,\r\nand serve hot. Just before taking it up, add the cream.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours. _Average cost_ per quart, 2s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALMOND & BLOSSOM.]\r\n\r\n    THE ALMOND-TREE.--This tree is indigenous to the northern parts\r\n    of Asia and Africa, but it is now cultivated in Europe,\r\n    especially in the south of France, Italy, and Spain. It flowers\r\n    in spring, and produces its fruit in August. Although there are\r\n    two kinds of almonds, the _sweet_ and the _bitter,_ they are\r\n    considered as only varieties of the same species. The best sweet\r\n    almonds brought to England, are called the Syrian or Jordan, and\r\n    come from Malaga; the inferior qualities are brought from\r\n    Valentia and Italy. _Bitter_ almonds come principally from\r\n    Magadore. Anciently, the almond was much esteemed by the nations\r\n    of the East. Jacob included it among the presents which he\r\n    designed for Joseph. The Greeks called it the Greek or Thasian\r\n    nut, and the Romans believed that by eating half a dozen of\r\n    them, they were secured against drunkenness, however deeply they\r\n    might imbibe. Almonds, however, are considered as very\r\n    indigestible. The _bitter_ contain, too, principles which\r\n    produce two violent poisons,--prussic acid and a kind of\r\n    volatile oil. It is consequently dangerous to eat them in large\r\n    quantities. Almonds pounded together with a little sugar and\r\n    water, however, produce a milk similar to that which is yielded\r\n    by animals. Their oil is used for making fine soap, and their\r\n    cake as a cosmetic.\r\n\r\nAPPLE SOUP.\r\n\r\n111. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of good boiling apples, 3/4 teaspoonful of\r\nwhite pepper, 6 cloves, cayenne or ginger to taste, 3 quarts of medium\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel and quarter the apples, taking out their cores; put them\r\ninto the stock, stew them gently till tender. Rub the whole through a\r\nstrainer, add the seasoning, give it one boil up, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_ per quart, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to December.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPLE AND BLOSSOM.]\r\n\r\n    THE APPLE.--This useful fruit is mentioned in Holy Writ; and\r\n    Homer describes it as valuable in his time. It was brought from\r\n    the East by the Romans, who held it in the highest estimation.\r\n    Indeed, some of the citizens of the \"Eternal city\" distinguished\r\n    certain favourite apples by their names. Thus the Manlians were\r\n    called after Manlius, the Claudians after Claudius, and the\r\n    Appians after Appius. Others were designated after the country\r\n    whence they were brought; as the Sidonians, the Epirotes, and\r\n    the Greeks. The best varieties are natives of Asia, and have, by\r\n    grafting them upon others, been introduced into Europe. The\r\n    crab, found in our hedges, is the only variety indigenous to\r\n    Britain; therefore, for the introduction of other kinds we are,\r\n    no doubt, indebted to the Romans. In the time of the Saxon\r\n    heptarchy, both Devon and Somerset were distinguished as _the\r\n    apple country_; and there are still existing in Herefordshire\r\n    some trees said to have been planted in the time of William the\r\n    Conqueror. From that time to this, the varieties of this\r\n    precious fruit have gone on increasing, and are now said to\r\n    number upwards of 1,500. It is peculiar to the temperate zone,\r\n    being found neither in Lapland, nor within the tropics. The best\r\n    baking apples for early use are the Colvilles; the best for\r\n    autumn are the rennets and pearmains; and the best for winter\r\n    and spring are russets. The best table, or eating apples, are\r\n    the Margarets for early use; the Kentish codlin and summer\r\n    pearmain for summer; and for autumn, winter, or spring, the\r\n    Dowton, golden and other pippins, as the ribstone, with small\r\n    russets. As a food, the apple cannot be considered to rank high,\r\n    as more than the half of it consists of water, and the rest of\r\n    its properties are not the most nourishing. It is, however, a\r\n    useful adjunct to other kinds of food, and, when cooked, is\r\n    esteemed as slightly laxative.\r\n\r\nARTICHOKE (JERUSALEM) SOUP.\r\n\r\n(_A White Soup_.)\r\n\r\n112. INGREDIENTS.--3 slices of lean bacon or ham, 1/2 a head of celery,\r\n1 turnip, 1 onion, 3 oz. of butter, 4 lbs. of artichokes, 1 pint of\r\nboiling milk, or 1/2 pint of boiling cream, salt and cayenne to taste, 2\r\nlumps of sugar, 2-1/2 quarts of white stock.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the bacon and vegetables, which should be cut into thin\r\nslices, into the stewpan with the butter. Braise these for 1/4 of an\r\nhour, keeping them well stirred. Wash and pare the artichokes, and after\r\ncutting them into thin slices, add them, with a pint of stock, to the\r\nother ingredients. When these have gently stewed down to a smooth pulp,\r\nput in the remainder of the stock. Stir it well, adding the seasoning,\r\nand when it has simmered for five minutes, pass it through a strainer.\r\nNow pour it back into the stewpan, let it again simmer five minutes,\r\ntaking care to skim it well, and stir it to the boiling milk or cream.\r\nServe with small sippets of bread fried in butter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_ per quart, 1s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to October.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS SOUP.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n113.

Put in the\r\nwater and ale, and season to taste with pepper and salt, and let it stew\r\ngently for 2 hours; then strain the liquor, and take off the fat, and\r\nadd the white beet, spinach, cabbage lettuce, and mint, sorrel, and\r\nsweet marjoram, pounded. Let these boil up in the liquor, then put in\r\nthe asparagus-tops cut small, and allow them to boil till all is tender.\r\nServe hot, with the French roll in the dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 3 hours. _Average cost_ per quart, 1s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from May to August.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n114. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of split peas, a teacupful of gravy, 4\r\nyoung onions, 1 lettuce cut small, 1/2 a head of celery, 1/2 a pint of\r\nasparagus cut small, 1/2 a pint of cream, 3 quarts of water: colour the\r\nsoup with spinach juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the peas, and rub them through a sieve; add the gravy, and\r\nthen stew by themselves the celery, onions, lettuce, and asparagus, with\r\nthe water. After this, stew altogether, and add the colouring and cream,\r\nand serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Peas 2-1/2 hours, vegetables 1 hour; altogether 4 hours.\r\n_Average cost_ per quart, 1s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASPARAGUS.]\r\n\r\n    ASPARAGUS.--The ancients called all the sprouts of young\r\n    vegetables asparagus, whence the name, which is now limited to a\r\n    particular species, embracing artichoke, alisander, asparagus,\r\n    cardoon, rampion, and sea-kale. They are originally mostly wild\r\n    seacoast plants; and, in this state, asparagus may still be\r\n    found on the northern as well as southern shores of Britain. It\r\n    is often vulgarly called, in London, _sparrowgrass_; and, in\r\n    it's cultivated form, hardly bears any resemblance to the\r\n    original plant. Immense quantities of it are raised for the\r\n    London market, at Mortlake and Deptford; but it belongs rather\r\n    to the classes of luxurious than necessary food. It is light and\r\n    easily digested, but is not very nutritious.\r\n\r\nBAKED SOUP.\r\n\r\n115. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of any kind of meat, any trimmings or odd\r\npieces; 2 onions, 2 carrots, 2 oz. of rice, 1 pint of split peas, pepper\r\nand salt to taste, 4 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the meat and vegetables in slices, add to them the rice and\r\npeas, season with pepper and salt. Put the whole in a jar, fill up with\r\nthe water, cover very closely, and bake for 4 hours.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 hours. _Average cost_, 2-1/2d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 or 12 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This will be found a very cheap and wholesome soup, and will be\r\nconvenient in those cases where baking is more easily performed than\r\nboiling.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARLEY SOUP.\r\n\r\n116. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of shin of beef, 1/4 lb. of pearl barley, a\r\nlarge bunch of parsley, 4 onions, 6 potatoes, salt and pepper, 4 quarts\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put in all the ingredients, and simmer gently for 3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours. _Average cost_, 2-1/2d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but more suitable for winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARLEY.]\r\n\r\n    BARLEY.--This, in the order of cereal grasses, is, in Britain,\r\n    the next plant to wheat in point of value, and exhibits several\r\n    species and varieties. From what country it comes originally, is\r\n    not known, but it was cultivated in the earliest ages of\r\n    antiquity, as the Egyptians were afflicted with the loss of it\r\n    in the ear, in the time of Moses. It was a favourite grain with\r\n    the Athenians, but it was esteemed as an ignominious food by the\r\n    Romans. Notwithstanding this, however, it was much used by them,\r\n    as it was in former times by the English, and still is, in the\r\n    Border counties, in Cornwall, and also in Wales. In other parts\r\n    of England, it is used mostly for malting purposes. It is less\r\n    nutritive than wheat; and in 100 parts, has of starch 79, gluten\r\n    6, saccharine matter 7, husk 8. It is, however, a lighter and\r\n    less stimulating food than wheat, which renders a decoction of\r\n    it well adapted for invalids whose digestion is weak.\r\n\r\nBREAD SOUP.\r\n\r\n(_Economical_.)\r\n\r\n117. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of bread crusts, 2 oz. butter, 1 quart of\r\ncommon stock.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the bread crusts in the stock with the butter; beat the\r\nwhole with a spoon, and keep it boiling till the bread and stock are\r\nwell mixed. Season with a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Half an hour. _Average cost_ per quart, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This is a cheap recipe, and will be found useful where extreme\r\neconomy is an object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUERN, or GRINDING-MILL.]\r\n\r\n    BREAD.--The origin of bread is involved in the obscurity of\r\n    distant ages. The Greeks attributed its invention to Pan; but\r\n    before they, themselves, had an existence, it was, no doubt, in\r\n    use among the primitive nations of mankind. The Chaldeans and\r\n    the Egyptians were acquainted with it, and Sarah, the companion\r\n    of Abraham, mixed flour and water together, kneaded it, and\r\n    covered it with ashes on the hearth. The Scriptures inform us\r\n    that leavened bread was known to the Israelites, but it is not\r\n    known when the art of fermenting it was discovered. It is said\r\n    that the Romans learnt it during their wars with Perseus, king\r\n    of Macedon, and that it was introduced to the \"imperial city\"\r\n    about 200 years before the birth of Christ. With them it no\r\n    doubt found its way into Britain; but after their departure from\r\n    the island, it probably ceased to be used. We know that King\r\n    Alfred allowed the unfermented cakes to burn in the neatherd's\r\n    cottage; and that, even in the sixteenth century, unfermented\r\n    cakes, kneaded by the women, were the only kind of bread known\r\n    to the inhabitants of Norway and Sweden. The Italians of this\r\n    day consume the greater portion of their flour in the form of\r\n    _polenta_, or soft pudding, vermicelli, and macaroni; and, in\r\n    the remoter districts of Scotland, much unfermented bread is\r\n    still used. We give a cut of the _quern_ grinding-mill, which,\r\n    towards the end of the last century, was in use in that country,\r\n    and which is thus described by Dr. Johnson in his \"Journey to\r\n    the Hebrides:\"--\"It consists of two stones about a foot and half\r\n    in diameter; the lower is a little convex, to which the\r\n    concavity of the upper must be fitted. In the middle of the\r\n    upper stone is a round hole, and on one side is a long handle.\r\n    The grinder sheds the corn gradually into the hole with one\r\n    hand, and works the handle round with the other. The corn slides\r\n    down the convexity of the lower stone, and by the motion of the\r\n    upper, is ground in its passage.\" Such a primitive piece of\r\n    machinery, it may safely be said, has entirely disappeared from\r\n    this country.--In other parts of this work, we shall have\r\n    opportunities of speaking of bread and bread-making, which, from\r\n    its great and general use in the nourishment of mankind, has\r\n    emphatically been called the \"staff of life.\" The necessity,\r\n    therefore, of having it both pure and good is of the first\r\n    importance.\r\n\r\nCABBAGE SOUP.\r\n\r\n118. INGREDIENTS.--1 large cabbage, 3 carrots, 2 onions, 4 or 5 slices\r\nof lean bacon, salt and pepper to taste, 2 quarts of medium stock No.\r\n105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scald the cabbage, exit it up and drain it. Line the stewpan\r\nwith the bacon, put in the cabbage, carrots, and onions; moisten with\r\nskimmings from the stock, and simmer very gently, till the cabbage is\r\ntender; add the stock, stew softly for half an hour, and carefully skim\r\noff every particle of fat. Season and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CABBAGE SEEDING.]\r\n\r\n    THE CABBAGE.--It is remarkable, that although there is no\r\n    country in the world now more plentifully supplied with fruits\r\n    and vegetables than Great Britain, yet the greater number of\r\n    these had no existence in it before the time of Henry VIII.\r\n    Anderson, writing under the date of 1548, says, \"The English\r\n    cultivated scarcely any vegetables before the last two\r\n    centuries. At the commencement of the reign, of Henry VIII.\r\n    neither salad, nor carrots, nor cabbages, nor radishes, nor any\r\n    other comestibles of a like nature, were grown in any part of\r\n    the kingdom; they came from Holland and Flanders.\" The original\r\n    of all the cabbage tribe is the wild plant _sea-colewort_, which\r\n    is to be found _wasting_ whatever sweetness it may have on the\r\n    desert air, on many of the cliffs of the south coast of England.\r\n    In this state, it scarcely weighs more than half an ounce, yet,\r\n    in a cultivated state, to what dimensions can it be made to\r\n    grow! However greatly the whole of the tribe is esteemed among\r\n    the moderns, by the ancients they were held in yet higher\r\n    estimation. The Egyptians adored and raised altars to them, and\r\n    the Greeks and Romans ascribed many of the most exalted virtues\r\n    to them. Cato affirmed, that the cabbage cured all diseases, and\r\n    declared, that it was to its use that the Romans were enabled to\r\n    live in health and without the assistance of physicians for 600\r\n    years. It was introduced by that people into Germany, Gaul, and,\r\n    no doubt, Britain; although, in this last, it may have been\r\n    suffered to pass into desuetude for some centuries. The whole\r\n    tribe is in general wholesome and nutritive, and forms a\r\n    valuable adjunct to animal food.\r\n\r\nSOUP A LA CANTATRICE.\r\n\r\n(_An Excellent Soup, very Beneficial for the Voice_.)\r\n\r\n119. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of sago, 1/2 pint of cream, the yolks of 3\r\neggs, 1 lump of sugar, and seasoning to taste, 1 bay-leaf (if liked), 2\r\nquarts of medium stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Having washed the sago in boiling water, let it be gradually\r\nadded to the nearly boiling stock. Simmer for 1/2 an hour, when it\r\nshould be well dissolved. Beat up the yolks of the eggs, add to them the\r\nboiling cream; stir these quickly in the soup, and serve immediately. Do\r\nnot let the soup boil, or the eggs will curdle.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--40 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This is a soup, the principal ingredients of which, sago and\r\neggs, have always been deemed very beneficial to the chest and throat.\r\nIn various quantities, and in different preparations, these have been\r\npartaken of by the principal singers of the day, including the\r\ncelebrated Swedish Nightingale, Jenny Lind, and, as they have always\r\navowed, with considerable advantage to the voice, in singing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARROT SOUP.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n120. INGREDIENTS.--4 quarts of liquor in which a leg of mutton or beef\r\nhas been boiled, a few beef-bones, 6 large carrots, 2 large onions, 1\r\nturnip; seasoning of salt and pepper to taste; cayenne.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the liquor, bones, onions, turnip, pepper, and salt, into a\r\nstewpan, and simmer for 3 hours. Scrape and cut the carrots thin, strain\r\nthe soup on them, and stew them till soft enough to pulp through a hair\r\nsieve or coarse cloth; then boil the pulp with the soup, which should be\r\nof the consistency of pea-soup. Add cayenne. Pulp only the red part of\r\nthe carrot, and make this soup the day before it is wanted.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4-1/2 hours. _Average cost_ per quart, 1-1/2d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n121. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of carrots, 3 oz. of butter, seasoning to\r\ntaste of salt and cayenne, 2 quarts of stock or gravy soup.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scrape and cut out all specks from the carrots, wash, and wipe\r\nthem dry, and then reduce them into quarter-inch slices. Put the butter\r\ninto a large stewpan, and when it is melted, add 2 lbs. of the sliced\r\ncarrots, and let them stew gently for an hour without browning. Add to\r\nthem the soup, and allow them to simmer till tender,--say for nearly an\r\nhour. Press them through a strainer with the soup, and add salt and\r\ncayenne if required. Boil the whole gently for 5 minutes, skim well, and\r\nserve as hot as possible.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/4 hour. _Average cost_ per quart, 1s. 1d.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAZZA AND CARROT LEAVES.]\r\n\r\n    THE CARROT.--There is a wild carrot which grows in England; but\r\n    it is white and small, and not much esteemed. The garden carrot\r\n    in general use, was introduced in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,\r\n    and was, at first, so highly esteemed, that the ladies wore\r\n    leaves of it in their head-dresses. It is of great value in the\r\n    culinary art, especially for soups and stews. It can be used\r\n    also for beer instead of malt, and, in distillation, it yields a\r\n    large quantity of spirit. The carrot is proportionably valuable\r\n    as it has more of the red than the yellow part. There is a large\r\n    red variety much used by the farmers for colouring butter. As a\r\n    garden vegetable, it is what is called the orange-carrot that is\r\n    usually cultivated. As a fattening food for cattle, it is\r\n    excellent; but for man it is indigestible, on account of its\r\n    fibrous matter. Of 1,000 parts, 95 consist of sugar, and 3 of\r\n    starch.--The accompanying cut represents a pretty winter\r\n    ornament, obtained by placing a cut from the top of the\r\n    carrot-root in a shallow vessel of water, when the young leaves\r\n    spring forth with a charming freshness and fullness.\r\n\r\nCELERY SOUP.\r\n\r\n122. INGREDIENTS.--9 heads of celery, 1 teaspoonful of salt, nutmeg to\r\ntaste, 1 lump of sugar, 1/2 pint of strong stock, a pint of cream, and 2\r\nquarts of boiling water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the celery into small pieces; throw it into the water,\r\nseasoned with the nutmeg, salt, and sugar. Boil it till sufficiently\r\ntender; pass it through a sieve, add the stock, and simmer it for half\r\nan hour. Now put in the cream, bring it to the boiling point, and serve\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This soup can be made brown, instead of white, by omitting the\r\ncream, and colouring it a little. When celery cannot be procured, half a\r\ndrachm of the seed, finely pounded, will give a flavour to the soup, if\r\nput in a quarter of an hour before it is done. A little of the essence\r\nof celery will answer the same purpose.\r\n\r\n    CELERY.--This plant is indigenous to Britain, and, in its wild\r\n    state, grows by the side of ditches and along some parts of the\r\n    seacoast. In this state it is called _smallaqe_, and, to some\r\n    extent, is a dangerous narcotic. By cultivation, however, it has\r\n    been brought to the fine flavour which the garden plant\r\n    possesses. In the vicinity of Manchester it is raised to an\r\n    enormous size. When our natural observation is assisted by the\r\n    accurate results ascertained by the light of science, how\r\n    infinitely does it enhance our delight in contemplating the\r\n    products of nature! To know, for example, that the endless\r\n    variety of colour which we see in plants is developed only by\r\n    the rays of the sun, is to know a truism sublime by its very\r\n    comprehensiveness. The cause of the whiteness of celery is\r\n    nothing more than the want of light in its vegetation, and in\r\n    order that this effect may be produced, the plant is almost\r\n    wholly covered with earth; the tops of the leaves alone being\r\n    suffered to appear above the ground.\r\n\r\nCHANTILLY SOUP.\r\n\r\n123. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of young green peas, a small bunch of\r\nparsley, 2 young onions, 2 quarts of medium stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the peas till quite tender, with the parsley and onions;\r\nthen rub them through a sieve, and pour the stock to them. Do not let it\r\nboil after the peas are added, or you will spoil the colour. Serve very\r\nhot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Half an hour. _Average_ cost, 1s. 6d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to the end of August.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Cold peas pounded in a mortar, with a little stock added to\r\nthem, make a very good soup in haste.\r\n\r\n    Parsley.--Among the Greeks, in the classic ages, a crown of\r\n    parsley was awarded, both in the Nemaean and Isthmian games, and\r\n    the voluptuous Anacreon pronounces this beautiful herb the\r\n    emblem of joy and festivity. It has an elegant leaf, and is\r\n    extensively used in the culinary art. When it was introduced to\r\n    Britain is not known. There are several varieties,--the\r\n    _plain_-leaved and the _curled_-leaved, _celery_-parsley,\r\n    _Hamburg_ parsley, and _purslane_. The curled is the best, and,\r\n    from the form of its leaf, has a beautiful appearance on a dish\r\n    as a garnish. Its flavour is, to many, very agreeable in soups;\r\n    and although to rabbits, hares, and sheep it is a luxury, to\r\n    parrots it is a poison. The celery-parsley is used as a celery,\r\n    and the Hamburg is cultivated only for its roots, which are used\r\n    as parsnips or carrots, to eat with meat. The purslane is a\r\n    native of South America, and is not now much in use.\r\n\r\nCHESTNUT (SPANISH) SOUP.\r\n\r\n124. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of Spanish chestnuts, 1/4 pint of cream;\r\nseasoning to taste of salt, cayenne, and mace; 1 quart of stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take the outer rind from the chestnuts, and put them into a\r\nlarge pan of warm water. As soon as this becomes too hot for the fingers\r\nto remain in it, take out the chestnuts, peel them quickly, and immerse\r\nthem in cold water, and wipe and weigh them. Now cover them with good\r\nstock, and stew them gently for rather more than 3/4 of an hour, or\r\nuntil they break when touched with a fork; then drain, pound, and rub\r\nthem through a fine sieve reversed; add sufficient stock, mace, cayenne,\r\nand salt, and stir it often until it boils, and put in the cream. The\r\nstock in which the chestnuts are boiled can be used for the soup, when\r\nits sweetness is not objected to, or it may, in part, be added to it;\r\nand the rule is, that 3/4 lb. of chestnuts should be given to each quart\r\nof soup.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--rather more than 1 hour. _Average cost_ per quart, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to February.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHESTNUT.]\r\n\r\n    THE CHESTNUT.--This fruit is said, by some, to have originally\r\n    come from Sardis, in Lydia; and by others, from Castanea, a city\r\n    of Thessaly, from which it takes its name. By the ancients it\r\n    was much used as a food, and is still common in France and\r\n    Italy, to which countries it is, by some, considered indigenous.\r\n    In the southern part of the European continent, it is eaten both\r\n    raw and roasted. The tree was introduced into Britain by the\r\n    Romans; but it only flourishes in the warmer parts of the\r\n    island, the fruit rarely arriving at maturity in Scotland. It\r\n    attains a great age, as well as an immense size. As a food, it\r\n    is the least oily and most farinaceous of all the nuts, and,\r\n    therefore, the easiest of digestion. The tree called the _horse\r\n    chestnut_ is very different, although its fruit very much\r\n    resembles that of the other. Its \"nuts,\" though eaten by horses\r\n    and some other animals, are unsuitable for human food.\r\n\r\nCOCOA-NUT SOUP.\r\n\r\n125. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of grated cocoa-nut, 6 oz. of rice flour, 1/2 a\r\nteaspoonful of mace; seasoning to taste of cayenne and salt; 1/4 of a\r\npint of boiling cream, 3 quarts of medium stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take the dark rind from the cocoa-nut, and grate it down small\r\non a clean grater; weigh it, and allow, for each quart of stock, 2 oz.\r\nof the cocoa-nut. Simmer it gently for 1 hour in the stock, which should\r\nthen be strained closely from it, and thickened for table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/4 hours. _Average cost_ per quart, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in Autumn.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCOA-NUT PALM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NUT & BLOSSOM.]\r\n\r\n    THE COCOA-NUT.--This is the fruit of one of the palms, than\r\n    which it is questionable if there is any other species of tree\r\n    marking, in itself, so abundantly the goodness of Providence, in\r\n    making provision for the wants of man. It grows wild in the\r\n    Indian seas, and in the eastern parts of Asia; and thence it has\r\n    been introduced into every part of the tropical regions. To the\r\n    natives of those climates, its bark supplies the material for\r\n    creating their dwellings; its leaves, the means of roofing them;\r\n    and the leaf-stalks, a kind of gauze for covering their windows,\r\n    or protecting the baby in the cradle. It is also made into\r\n    lanterns, masks to screen the face from the heat of the sun,\r\n    baskets, wicker-work, and even a kind of paper for writing on.\r\n    Combs, brooms, torches, ropes, matting, and sailcloth are made\r\n    of its fibers. With these, too, beds are made and cushions\r\n    stuffed. Oars are supplied by the leaves; drinking-cups, spoons,\r\n    and other domestic utensils by the shells of the nuts; milk by\r\n    its juice, of which, also, a kind of honey and sugar are\r\n    prepared. When fermented, it furnishes the means of\r\n    intoxication; and when the fibres are burned, their ashes supply\r\n    an alkali for making soap. The buds of the tree bear a striking\r\n    resemblance to cabbage when boiled; but when they are cropped,\r\n    the tree dies. In a fresh state, the kernel is eaten raw, and\r\n    its juice is a most agreeable and refreshing beverage. When the\r\n    nut is imported to this country, its fruit is, in general,\r\n    comparatively dry, and is considered indigestible. The tree is\r\n    one of the least productive of the palm tribe.\r\n\r\nSOUP A LA CRECY.\r\n\r\n126. INGREDIENTS.--4 carrots, 2 sliced onions, 1 cut lettuce, and\r\nchervil; 2 oz. butter, 1 pint of lentils, the crumbs of 2 French rolls,\r\nhalf a teacupful of rice, 2 quarts of medium stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the vegetables with the butter in the stewpan, and let them\r\nsimmer 5 minutes; then add the lentils and 1 pint of the stock, and stew\r\ngently for half an hour. Now fill it up with the remainder of the stock,\r\nlet it boil another hour, and put in the crumb of the rolls. When well\r\nsoaked, rub all through a tammy. Have ready the rice boiled; pour the\r\nsoup over this, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-3/4 hour. _Average cost_,1s. 2d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LENTIL.]\r\n\r\n    THE LENTIL.--This belongs to the legumious or _pulse_ kind of\r\n    vegetables, which rank next to the corn plants in their\r\n    nutritive properties. The lentil is a variety of the bean tribe,\r\n    but in England is not used as human food, although considered\r\n    the best of all kinds for pigeons. On the Continent it is\r\n    cultivated for soups, as well as for other preparations for the\r\n    table; and among the presents which David received from Shobi,\r\n    as recounted in the Scriptures, were beans, lentils, and parched\r\n    pulse. Among the Egyptians it was extensively used, and among\r\n    the Greeks, the Stoics had a maxim, which declared, that \"a wise\r\n    man acts always with reason, and prepares his own lentils.\"\r\n    Among the Romans it was not much esteemed, and from them the\r\n    English may have inherited a prejudice against it, on account,\r\n    it is said, of its rendering men indolent. It takes its name\r\n    from _lentus_ 'slow,' and, according to Pliny, produces mildness\r\n    and moderation of temper.\r\n\r\nCUCUMBER SOUP (French Recipe).\r\n\r\n127. INGREDIENTS.--1 large cucumber, a piece of butter the size of a\r\nwalnut, a little chervil and sorrel cut in large pieces, salt and pepper\r\nto taste, the yolks of 2 eggs, 1 gill of cream, 1 quart of medium stock\r\nNo. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare the cucumber, quarter it, and take out the seeds; cut it\r\nin thin slices, put these on a plate with a little salt, to draw the\r\nwater from them; drain, and put them in your stewpan, with the butter.\r\nWhen they are warmed through, without being browned, pour the stock on\r\nthem. Add the sorrel, chervil, and seasoning, and boil for 40 minutes.\r\nMix the well-beaten yolks of the eggs with the cream, which add at the\r\nmoment of serving.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 2d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to September.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n    THE CUCUMBER.--The antiquity of this fruit is very great. In the\r\n    sacred writings we find that the people of Israel regretted it,\r\n    whilst sojourning in the desert; and at the present time, the\r\n    cucumber, and other fruits of its class, form a large portion of\r\n    the food of the Egyptian people. By the Eastern nations\r\n    generally, as well as by the Greeks and Romans, it was greatly\r\n    esteemed. Like the melon, it was originally brought from Asia by\r\n    the Romans, and in the 14th century it was common in England,\r\n    although, in the time of the wars of \"the Roses,\" it seems no\r\n    longer to have been cultivated. It is a cold food, and of\r\n    difficult digestion when eaten raw. As a preserved sweetmeat,\r\n    however, it is esteemed one of the most agreeable.\r\n\r\nEGG SOUP.\r\n\r\n128. INGREDIENTS.--A tablespoonful of flour, 4 eggs, 2 small blades of\r\nfinely-pounded mace, 2 quarts of stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat up the flour smoothly in a teaspoonful of cold stock, and\r\nput in the eggs; throw them into boiling stock, stirring all the time.\r\nSimmer for 1/4 of an hour. Season and serve with a French roll in the\r\ntureen, or fried sippets of bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_. 1/2 an hour. _Average cost_,11d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUP A LA FLAMANDE (Flemish).\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n129. INGREDIENTS.--1 turnip, 1 small carrot, 1/2 head of celery, 6 green\r\nonions shred very fine, 1 lettuce cut small, chervil, 1/4 pint of\r\nasparagus cut small, 1/4 pint of peas, 2 oz. butter, the yolks of 4\r\neggs, 1/2 pint of cream, salt to taste, 1 lump of sugar, 2 quarts of\r\nstock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the vegetables in the butter to stew gently for an hour\r\nwith a teacupful of stock; then add the remainder of the stock, and\r\nsimmer for another hour. Now beat the yolks of the eggs well, mix with\r\nthe cream (previously boiled), and strain through a hair sieve. Take the\r\nsoup off the fire, put the eggs, &c. to it, and keep stirring it well.\r\nBring it to a boil, but do not leave off stirring, or the eggs will\r\ncurdle. Season with salt, and add the sugar.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--24 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 9d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from May to August.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n    CHERVIL.--Although the roots of this plant are poisonous, its\r\n    leaves are tender, and are used in salads. In antiquity it made\r\n    a relishing dish, when prepared with oil, wine, and gravy. It is\r\n    a native of various parts of Europe; and the species cultivated\r\n    in the gardens of Paris, has beautifully frizzled leaves.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n130. INGREDIENTS.--5 onions, 5 heads of celery, 10 moderate-sized\r\npotatoes, 3 oz. butter, 1/2 pint of water, 1/2 pint of cream, 2 quarts\r\nof stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice the onions, celery, and potatoes, and put them with the\r\nbutter and water into a stewpan, and simmer for an hour. Then fill up\r\nthe stewpan with stock, and boil gently till the potatoes are done,\r\nwhich will be in about an hour. Rub all through a tammy, and add the\r\ncream (previously boiled). Do not let it boil after the cream is put in.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 hours. __Average cost_,1s. 4d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to May.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This soup can be made with water instead of stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUP A LA JULIENNE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRIPS OF VEGETABLE.]\r\n\r\n131. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of carrots, 1/2 pint of turnips, 1/4 pint of\r\nonions, 2 or 3 leeks, 1/2 head of celery, 1 lettuce, a little sorrel and\r\nchervil, if liked, 2 oz. of butter, 2 quarts of stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the vegetables into strips of about 1-1/4 inch long, and be\r\nparticular they are all the same size, or some will be hard whilst the\r\nothers will be done to a pulp. Cut the lettuce, sorrel, and chervil into\r\nlarger pieces; fry the carrots in the butter, and pour the stock boiling\r\nto them. When this is done, add all the other vegetables, and herbs, and\r\nstew gently for at least an hour. Skim off all the fat, pour the soup\r\nover thin slices of bread, cut round about the size of a shilling, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 3d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--In summer, green peas, asparagus-tops, French beans, &c. can be\r\nadded. When the vegetables are very strong, instead of frying them in\r\nbutter at first, they should be blanched, and afterwards simmered in the\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n    SORREL.--This is one of the _spinaceous_ plants, which take\r\n    their name from spinach, which is the chief among them. It is\r\n    little used in English cookery, but a great deal in French, in\r\n    which it is employed for soups, sauces, and salads. In English\r\n    meadows it is usually left to grow wild; but in France, where it\r\n    is cultivated, its flavour is greatly improved.\r\n\r\nKALE BROSE (a Scotch Recipe).\r\n\r\n132. INGREDIENTS.--Half an ox-head or cow-heel, a teacupful of toasted\r\noatmeal, salt to taste, 2 handfuls of greens, 3 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a broth of the ox-head or cow-heel, and boil it till oil\r\nfloats on the top of the liquor, then boil the greens, shred, in it. Put\r\nthe oatmeal, with a little salt, into a basin, and mix with it quickly a\r\nteacupful of the fat broth: it should not run into one doughy mass, but\r\nform knots. Stir it into the whole, give one boil, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 hours. _Average cost_, 8d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but more suitable in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEEK SOUP.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n133. INGREDIENTS.--A sheep's head, 3 quarts of water, 12 leeks cut\r\nsmall, pepper and salt to taste, oatmeal to thicken.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Prepare the head, either by skinning or cleaning the skin very\r\nnicely; split it in two; take out the brains, and put it into boiling\r\nwater; add the leeks and seasoning, and simmer very gently for 4 hours.\r\nMix smoothly, with cold water, as much oatmeal as will make the soup\r\ntolerably thick; pour it into the soup; continue stirring till the whole\r\nis blended and well done, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 4d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nCOMMONLY CALLED COCK-A-LEEKIE.\r\n\r\n134. INGREDIENTS.--A capon or large fowl (sometimes an old cock, from\r\nwhich the recipe takes its name, is used), which should be trussed as\r\nfor boiling; 2 or 3 bunches of fine leeks, 5 quarts of stock No. 105,\r\npepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Well wash the leeks (and, if old, scald them in boiling water\r\nfor a few minutes), taking off the roots and part of the heads, and cut\r\nthem into lengths of about an inch. Put the fowl into the stock, with,\r\nat first, one half of the leeks, and allow it to simmer gently. In half\r\nan hour add the remaining leeks, and then it may simmer for 3 or 4 hours\r\nlonger. It should be carefully skimmed, and can be seasoned to taste. In\r\nserving, take out the fowl, and carve it neatly, placing the pieces in a\r\ntureen, and pouring over them the soup, which should be very thick of\r\nleeks (a _purée_ of leeks the French would call it).\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d. per quart; or, with stock No.\r\n106, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Without the fowl, the above, which would then be merely called\r\nleek soup, is very good, and also economical. Cock-a-leekie was largely\r\nconsumed at the Burns Centenary Festival at the Crystal Palace,\r\nSydenham, in 1859.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEEKS.]\r\n\r\n    THE LEEK.--As in the case of the cucumber, this vegetable was\r\n    bewailed by the Israelites in their journey through the desert.\r\n    It is one of the alliaceous tribe, which consists of the onion,\r\n    garlic, chive, shallot, and leek. These, as articles of food,\r\n    are perhaps more widely diffused over the face of the earth than\r\n    any other _genus_ of edible plants. It is the national badge of\r\n    the Welsh, and tradition ascribes to St. David its introduction\r\n    to that part of Britain. The origin of the wearing of the leek\r\n    on St. David's day, among that people, is thus given in\r\n    \"BEETON'S DICTIONARY of UNIVERSAL INFORMATION:\"--\"It probably\r\n    originated from the custom of _Cymhortha_, or the friendly aid,\r\n    practised among farmers. In some districts of South Wales, all\r\n    the neighbours of a small farmer were wont to appoint a day when\r\n    they attended to plough his land, and the like; and, at such\r\n    time, it was the custom for each to bring his portion of leeks\r\n    with him for making the broth or soup.\" (_See_ ST. DAVID.)\r\n    Others derive the origin of the custom from the battle of\r\n    Cressy. The plant, when grown in Wales and Scotland, is sharper\r\n    than it is in England, and its flavour is preferred by many to\r\n    that of the onion in broth. It is very wholesome, and, to\r\n    prevent its tainting the breath, should be well boiled.\r\n\r\nMACARONI SOUP.\r\n\r\n135. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of macaroni, a piece of butter the size of a\r\nwalnut, salt to taste, 2 quarts of clear stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Throw the macaroni and butter into boiling water, with a pinch\r\nof salt, and simmer for 1/2 an hour. When it is tender, drain and cut it\r\ninto thin rings or lengths, and drop it into the boiling stock. Stew\r\ngently for 15 minutes, and serve grated Parmesan cheese with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACARONI.]\r\n\r\n    MACARONI.--This is the favourite food of Italy, where,\r\n    especially among the Neapolitans, it may be regarded as the\r\n    staff of life. \"The crowd of London,\" says Mr. Forsyth, \"is a\r\n    double line in quick motion; it is the crowd of business. The\r\n    crowd of Naples consists in a general tide rolling up and down,\r\n    and in the middle of this tide, a hundred eddies of men. You are\r\n    stopped by a carpenter's bench, you are lost among shoemakers'\r\n    stalls, and you dash among the _pots of a macaroni stall_.\" This\r\n    article of food is nothing more than a thick paste, made of the\r\n    best wheaten flour, with a small quantity of water. When it has\r\n    been well worked, it is put into a hollow cylindrical vessel,\r\n    pierced with holes of the size of tobacco-pipes at the bottom.\r\n    Through these holes the mass is forced by a powerful screw\r\n    bearing on a piece of wood made exactly to fit the inside of the\r\n    cylinder. Whilst issuing from the holes, it is partially baked\r\n    by a fire placed below the cylinder, and is, at the same time,\r\n    drawn away and hung over rods placed about the room, in order to\r\n    dry. In a few days it is fit for use. As it is both wholesome\r\n    and nutritious, it ought to be much more used by all classes in\r\n    England than it is. It generally accompanies Parmesan cheese to\r\n    the tables of the rich, but is also used for thickening soups\r\n    and making puddings.\r\n\r\nSOUP MAIGRE (i.e. without Meat).\r\n\r\n136. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. butter, 6 onions sliced, 4 heads of celery, 2\r\nlettuces, a small bunch of parsley, 2 handfuls of spinach, 3 pieces of\r\nbread-crust, 2 blades of mace, salt and pepper to taste, the yolks of 2\r\neggs, 3 teaspoonfuls of vinegar, 2 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Melt the butter in a stewpan, and put in the onions to stew\r\ngently for 3 or 4 minutes; then add the celery, spinach, lettuces, and\r\nparsley, cut small. Stir the ingredients well for 10 minutes. Now put in\r\nthe water, bread, seasoning, and mace. Boil gently for 1-1/2 hour, and,\r\nat the moment of serving, beat in the yolks of the eggs and the vinegar,\r\nbut do not let it boil, or the eggs will curdle.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 6d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LETTUCE.]\r\n\r\n    THE LETTUCE.--This is one of the acetarious vegetables, which\r\n    comprise a large class, chiefly used as pickles, salads, and\r\n    other condiments. The lettuce has in all antiquity been\r\n    distinguished as a kitchen-garden plant. It was, without\r\n    preparation, eaten by the Hebrews with the Paschal lamb; the\r\n    Greeks delighted in it, and the Romans, in the time of Domitian,\r\n    had it prepared with eggs, and served in the first course at\r\n    their tables, merely to excite their appetites. Its botanical\r\n    name is _Lactuca_, so called from the milky juice it exudes when\r\n    its stalks are cut. It possesses a narcotic virtue, noticed by\r\n    ancient physicians; and even in our day a lettuce supper is\r\n    deemed conducive to repose. Its proper character, however, is\r\n    that of a cooling summer vegetable, not very nutritive, but\r\n    serving as a corrective, or diluent of animal food.\r\n\r\nMILK SOUP (a Nice Dish for Children).\r\n\r\n137. INGREDIENTS.--2 quarts of milk, 1 saltspoonful of salt, 1\r\nteaspoonful of powdered cinnamon, 3 teaspoonfuls of pounded sugar, or\r\nmore if liked, 4 thin slices of bread, the yolks of 6 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the milk with the salt, cinnamon, and sugar; lay the bread\r\nin a deep dish, pour over it a little of the milk, and keep it hot over\r\na stove, without burning. Beat up the yolks of the eggs, add them to the\r\nmilk, and stir it over the fire till it thickens. Do not let it curdle.\r\nPour it upon the bread, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 of an hour. _Average cost_, 8d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 children.\r\n\r\n\r\nONION SOUP.\r\n\r\n138. INGREDIENTS.--6 large onions, 2 oz. of butter, salt and pepper to\r\ntaste, 1/4 pint of cream, 1 quart of stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the onions, put them in the butter, stir them\r\noccasionally, but do not let them brown. When tender, put the stock to\r\nthem, and season; strain the soup, and add the boiling cream.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEAP ONION SOUP.\r\n\r\n139. INGREDIENTS.--8 middling-sized onions, 3 oz. of butter, a\r\ntablespoonful of rice-flour, salt and pepper to taste, 1 teaspoonful of\r\npowdered sugar, thickening of butter and flour, 2 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the onions small, put them in the stewpan with the butter,\r\nand fry them well; mix the rice-flour smoothly with the water, add the\r\nonions, seasoning, and sugar, and simmer till tender. Thicken with\r\nbutter and flour, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_,4d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONION.]\r\n\r\n    THE ONION.--Like the cabbage, this plant was erected into an\r\n    object of worship by the idolatrous Egyptians 2,000 years before\r\n    the Christian era, and it still forms a favourite food in the\r\n    country of these people, as well as in other parts of Africa.\r\n    When it was first introduced to England, has not been\r\n    ascertained; but it has long been in use, and esteemed as a\r\n    favourite seasoning plant to various dishes. In warmer climates\r\n    it is much milder in its flavour; and such as are grown in Spain\r\n    and Portugal, are, comparatively speaking, very large, and are\r\n    often eaten both in a boiled and roasted state. The Strasburg is\r\n    the most esteemed; and, although all the species have highly\r\n    nutritive properties, they impart such a disagreeable odour to\r\n    the breath, that they are often rejected even where they are\r\n    liked. Chewing a little raw parsley is said to remove this\r\n    odour.\r\n\r\nPAN KAIL.\r\n\r\n140. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of cabbage, or Savoy greens; 1/4 lb. of butter\r\nor dripping, salt and pepper to taste, oatmeal for thickening, 2 quarts\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the cabbage very fine, thicken the water with oatmeal, put\r\nin the cabbage and butter, or dripping; season and simmer for 1-1/2\r\nhour. It can be made sooner by blanching and mashing the greens, adding\r\nany good liquor that a joint has been boiled in, and then further\r\nthicken with bread or pounded biscuit.\r\n\r\n_Time_--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1-1/2d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but more suitable in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n    THE SAVOY.--This is a close-hearted wrinkle-leaved cabbage,\r\n    sweet and tender, especially the middle leaves, and in season\r\n    from November to spring. The yellow species bears hard weather\r\n    without injury, whilst the _dwarf_ kind are improved and\r\n    rendered more tender by frost.\r\n\r\nPARSNIP SOUP.\r\n\r\n141. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of sliced parsnips, 2 oz. of butter, salt and\r\ncayenne to taste, 1 quart of stock No. 106.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the parsnips into the stewpan with the butter, which has\r\nbeen previously melted, and simmer them till quite tender. Then add\r\nnearly a pint of stock, and boil together for half an hour. Pass all\r\nthrough a fine strainer, and put to it the remainder of the stock.\r\nSeason, boil, and serve immediately.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 6d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to April.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n    THE PARSNIP.--This is a biennial plant, with a root like a\r\n    carrot, which, in nutritive and saccharine matter, it nearly\r\n    equals. It is a native of Britain, and, in its wild state, may\r\n    be found, in many parts, growing by the road-sides. It is also\r\n    to be found, generally distributed over Europe; and, in Catholic\r\n    countries, is mostly used with salt fish, in Lent. In Scotland\r\n    it forms an excellent dish, when beat up with butter and\r\n    potatoes; it is, also, excellent when fried. In Ireland it is\r\n    found to yield, in conjunction with the hop, a pleasant\r\n    beverage; and it contains as much spirit as the carrot, and\r\n    makes an excellent wine. Its proportion of nutritive matter is\r\n    99 parts in 1,000; 9 being mucilage and 90 sugar.\r\n\r\nPEA SOUP (GREEN).\r\n\r\n142. INGREDIENTS.--3 pints of green peas, 1/4 lb. of butter, 2 or three\r\nthin slices of ham, 6 onions sliced, 4 shredded lettuces, the crumb of 2\r\nFrench rolls, 2 handfuls of spinach, 1 lump of sugar, 2 quarts of common\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the butter, ham, 1 quart of the peas, onions, and lettuces,\r\nto a pint of stock, and simmer for an hour; then add the remainder of\r\nthe stock, with the crumb of the French rolls, and boil for another\r\nhour. Now boil the spinach, and squeeze it very dry. Rub the soup\r\nthrough a sieve, and the spinach with it, to colour it. Have ready a\r\npint of _young_ peas boiled; add them to the soup, put in the sugar,\r\ngive one boil, and serve. If necessary, add salt.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 9d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to the end of August.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--It will be well to add, if the peas are not quite young, a\r\nlittle sugar. Where economy is essential, water may be used instead of\r\nstock for this soup, boiling in it likewise the pea-shells; but use a\r\ndouble quantity of vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER PEA SOUP (YELLOW).\r\n\r\n143. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of split peas, 2 lbs. of shin of beef,\r\ntrimmings of meat or poultry, a slice of bacon, 2 large carrots, 2\r\nturnips, 5 large onions, 1 head of celery, seasoning to taste, 2 quarts\r\nof soft water, any bones left from roast meat, 2 quarts of common stock,\r\nor liquor in which a joint of meat has been boiled.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the peas to soak over-night in soft water, and float off\r\nsuch as rise to the top. Boil them in the water till tender enough to\r\npulp; then add the ingredients mentioned above, and simmer for 2 hours,\r\nstirring it occasionally. Pass the whole through a sieve, skim well,\r\nseason, and serve with toasted bread cut in dice.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 hours. _Average cost_, 6d. per quart. _Seasonable_ all the\r\nyear round, but more suitable for cold weather. _Sufficient_ for 12\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEA.]\r\n\r\n    THE PEA.--It is supposed that the common gray pea, found wild in\r\n    Greece, and other parts of the Levant, is the original of the\r\n    common garden pea, and of all the domestic varieties belonging\r\n    to it. The gray, or field pea, called _bisallie_ by the French,\r\n    is less subject to run into varieties than the garden kinds, and\r\n    is considered by some, perhaps on that account, to be the wild\r\n    plant, retaining still a large proportion of its original habit.\r\n    From the tendency of all other varieties \"to run away\" and\r\n    become different to what they originally were, it is very\r\n    difficult to determine the races to which they belong. The pea\r\n    was well known to the Romans, and, probably, was introduced to\r\n    Britain at an early period; for we find peas mentioned by\r\n    Lydgate, a poet of the 15th century, as being hawked in London.\r\n    They seem, however, for a considerable time, to have fallen out\r\n    of use; for, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Fuller tells us\r\n    they were brought from Holland, and were accounted \"fit dainties\r\n    for ladies, they came so far and cost so dear.\" There are some\r\n    varieties of peas which have no lining in their pods, which are\r\n    eaten cooked in the same way as kidney-beans. They are called\r\n    _sugar_ peas, and the best variety is the large crooked sugar,\r\n    which is also very good, used in the common way, as a culinary\r\n    vegetable. There is also a white sort, which readily splits when\r\n    subjected to the action of millstones set wide apart, so as not\r\n    to grind them. These are used largely for soups, and especially\r\n    for sea-stores. From the quantity of farinaceous and saccharine\r\n    matter contained in the pea, it is highly nutritious as an\r\n    article of food.\r\n\r\nPEA SOUP (inexpensive).\r\n\r\n144. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of onions, 1/4 lb. of carrots, 2 oz. of\r\ncelery, 3/4 lb. of split peas, a little mint, shred fine; 1\r\ntablespoonful of coarse brown sugar, salt and pepper to taste, 4 quarts\r\nof water, or liquor in which a joint of meat has been boiled.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Fry the vegetables for 10 minutes in a little butter or\r\ndripping, previously cutting them up in small pieces; pour the water on\r\nthem, and when boiling add the peas. Let them simmer for nearly 3 hours,\r\nor until the peas are thoroughly done. Add the sugar, seasoning, and\r\nmint; boil for 1/4 of an hour, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 1-1/2d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 12 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO SOUP.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n145. INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs. of mealy potatoes, boiled or steamed very dry,\r\npepper and salt to taste, 2 quarts of stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--When the potatoes are boiled, mash them smoothly, that no lumps\r\nremain, and gradually put them to the boiling stock; pass it through a\r\nsieve, season, and simmer for 5 minutes. Skim well, and serve with fried\r\nbread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 10d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n146. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of shin of beef, 1 lb. of potatoes, 1 onion,\r\n1/2 a pint of peas, 2 oz. of rice, 2 heads of celery, pepper and salt to\r\ntaste, 3 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the beef into thin slices, chop the potatoes and onion, and\r\nput them in a stewpan with the water, peas, and rice. Stew gently till\r\nthe gravy is drawn from the meat; strain it off, take out the beef, and\r\npulp the other ingredients through a coarse sieve. Put the pulp back in\r\nthe soup, cut up the celery in it, and simmer till this is tender.\r\nSeason, and serve with fried bread cut into it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours. _Average cost_, 4d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 12 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n(_Very Economical_.)\r\n\r\n147. INGREDIENTS.--4 middle-sized potatoes well pared, a thick slice of\r\nbread, 6 leeks peeled and cut into thin slices as far as the white\r\nextends upwards from the roots, a teacupful of rice, a teaspoonful of\r\nsalt, and half that of pepper, and 2 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--The water must be completely boiling before anything is put\r\ninto it; then add the whole of the ingredients at once, with the\r\nexception of the rice, the salt, and the pepper. Cover, and let these\r\ncome to a brisk boil; put in the others, and let the whole boil slowly\r\nfor an hour, or till all the ingredients are thoroughly done, and their\r\nseveral juices extracted and mixed.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 3d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POTATOES.]\r\n\r\n    THE POTATO.--Humboldt doubted whether this root was a native of\r\n    South America; but it has been found growing wild both in Chili\r\n    and Buenos Ayres. It was first brought to Spain from the\r\n    neighbourhood of Quito, in the early part of the sixteenth\r\n    century, first to England from Virginia, in 1586, and first\r\n    planted by Sir Walter Raleigh, on his estate of Youghal, near\r\n    Cork, in Ireland. Thence it was brought and planted in\r\n    Lancashire, in England, and was, at first, recommended to be\r\n    eaten as a delicate dish, and not as common food. This was in\r\n    1587. _Nutritious Properties_.--Of a thousand parts of the\r\n    potato, Sir H. Davy found about a fourth nutritive; say, 200\r\n    mucilage or starch, 20 sugar, and 30 gluten.\r\n\r\nPRINCE OF WALES'S SOUP.\r\n\r\n148. INGREDIENTS.--12 turnips, 1 lump of sugar, 2 spoonfuls of strong\r\nveal stock, salt and white pepper to taste, 2 quarts of very bright\r\nstock, No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the turnips, and with a cutter cut them in balls as round\r\nas possible, but very small. Put them in the stock, which must be very\r\nbright, and simmer till tender. Add the veal stock and seasoning. Have\r\nlittle pieces of bread cut round, about the size of a shilling; moisten\r\nthem with stock; put them into a tureen and pour the soup over without\r\nshaking, for fear of crumbling the bread, which would spoil the\r\nappearance of the soup, and make it look thick.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in the winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n    THE PRINCE Of WALES.--This soup was invented by a philanthropic\r\n    friend of the Editress, to be distributed among the poor of a\r\n    considerable village, when the Prince of Wales attained his\r\n    majority, on the 9th November, 1859. Accompanying this fact, the\r\n    following notice, which appears in \"BEETON'S DICTIONARY OF\r\n    UNIVERSAL INFORMATION\" may appropriately be introduced,\r\n    premising that British princes attain their majority in their\r\n    18th year, whilst mortals of ordinary rank do not arrive at that\r\n    period till their 21st.--\"ALBERT EDWARD, Prince of Wales, and\r\n    heir to the British throne, merits a place in this work on\r\n    account of the high responsibilities which he is, in all\r\n    probability, destined to fulfil as sovereign of the British\r\n    empire. On the 10th of November, 1858, he was gazetted as having\r\n    been invested with the rank of a colonel in the army. Speaking\r\n    of this circumstance, the _Times_ said,--'The significance of\r\n    this event is, that it marks the period when the heir to the\r\n    British throne is about to take rank among men, and to enter\r\n    formally upon a career, which every loyal subject of the queen\r\n    will pray may be a long and a happy one, for his own sake and\r\n    for the sake of the vast empire which, in the course of nature,\r\n    he will one day be called to govern. The best wish that we can\r\n    offer for the young prince is, that in his own path he may ever\r\n    keep before him the bright example of his royal mother, and show\r\n    himself worthy of her name.' There are few in these realms who\r\n    will not give a fervent response to these sentiments. B.\r\n    November 9th, 1841.\"\r\n\r\nPOTAGE PRINTANIER, OR SPRING SOUP.\r\n\r\n149. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 a pint of green peas, if in season, a little\r\nchervil, 2 shredded lettuces, 2 onions, a very small bunch of parsley, 2\r\noz. of butter, the yolks of 3 eggs, 1 pint of water, seasoning to taste,\r\n2 quarts of stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put in a very clean stewpan the chervil, lettuces, onions,\r\nparsley, and butter, to 1 pint of water, and let them simmer till\r\ntender. Season with salt and pepper; when done, strain off the\r\nvegetables, and put two-thirds of the liquor they were boiled in to the\r\nstock. Beat up the yolks of the eggs with the other third, give it a\r\ntoss over the fire, and at the moment of serving, add this, with the\r\nvegetables which you strained off, to the soup.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 of an hour. _Average cost_, 1s. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from May to October.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE SOUP.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n150. INGREDIENTS.--4 oz. of Patna rice, salt, cayenne, and mace, 2\r\nquarts of white stock.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Throw the rice into boiling water, and let it remain 5 minutes;\r\nthen pour it into a sieve, and allow it to drain well. Now add it to the\r\nstock boiling, and allow it to stew till it is quite tender; season to\r\ntaste. Serve quickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 3d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARS OF RICE.]\r\n\r\n    RICE.--This is a plant of Indian origin, and has formed the\r\n    principal food of the Indian and Chinese people from the most\r\n    remote antiquity. Both Pliny and Dioscorides class it with the\r\n    cereals, though Galen places it among the vegetables. Be this as\r\n    it may, however, it was imported to Greece, from India, about\r\n    286 years before Christ, and by the ancients it was esteemed\r\n    both nutritious and fattening. There are three kinds of\r\n    rice,--the Hill rice, the Patna, and the Carolina, of the United\r\n    States. Of these, only the two latter are imported to this\r\n    country, and the Carolina is considered the best, as it is the\r\n    dearest. The nourishing properties of rice are greatly inferior\r\n    to those of wheat; but it is both a light and a wholesome food.\r\n    In combination with other foods, its nutritive qualities are\r\n    greatly increased; but from its having little stimulating power,\r\n    it is apt, when taken in large quantities alone, to lie long on\r\n    the stomach.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n151. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of rice, the yolks of 4 eggs, 1/2 a pint of\r\ncream, rather more than 2 quarts of stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the rice in the stock, and rub half of it through a tammy;\r\nput the stock in the stewpan, add all the rice, and simmer gently for 5\r\nminutes. Beat the yolks of the eggs, mix them with the cream (previously\r\nboiled), and strain through a hair sieve; take the soup off the fire,\r\nadd the eggs and cream, stirring frequently. Heat it gradually, stirring\r\nall the time; but do not let it boil, or the eggs will curdle.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 4d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAGO SOUP.\r\n\r\n152. INGREDIENTS.--5 oz. of sago, 2 quarts of stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the sago in boiling water, and add it, by degrees, to the\r\nboiling stock, and simmer till the sago is entirely dissolved, and forms\r\na sort of jelly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Nearly an hour. _Average cost_, 10d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The yolks of 2 eggs, beaten up with a little cream, previously\r\nboiled, and added at the moment of serving, much improves this soup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAGO PALM.]\r\n\r\n    SAGO.--The farinaceous food of this name constitutes the pith of\r\n    the SAGO tree (the _Sagus farinifera_ of Linnaeus), which grows\r\n    spontaneously in the East Indies and in the archipelago of the\r\n    Indian Ocean. There it forms the principal farinaceous diet of\r\n    the inhabitants. In order to procure it, the tree is felled and\r\n    sawn in pieces. The pith is then taken out, and put in\r\n    receptacles of cold water, where it is stirred until the flour\r\n    separates from the filaments, and sinks to the bottom, where it\r\n    is suffered to remain until the water is poured off, when it is\r\n    taken out and spread on wicker frames to dry. To give it the\r\n    round granular form in which we find it come to this country, it\r\n    is passed through a colander, then rubbed into little balls, and\r\n    dried. The tree is not fit for felling until it has attained a\r\n    growth of seven years, when a single trunk will yield 600 lbs.\r\n    weight; and, as an acre of ground will grow 430 of these trees,\r\n    a large return of flour is the result. The best quality has a\r\n    slightly reddish hue, and easily dissolves to a jelly, in hot\r\n    water. As a restorative diet, it is much used.\r\n\r\nSEMOLINA SOUP.\r\n\r\n153. INGREDIENTS.--5 oz. of semolina, 2 quarts of boiling stock, No.\r\n105, or 106.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Drop the semolina into the boiling stock, and keep stirring, to\r\nprevent its burning. Simmer gently for half an hour, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 an hour. _Average cost_, 10d. per quart, or 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n    SEMOLINA.--This is the heart of the _grano duro_ wheat of Italy,\r\n    which is imported for the purpose of making the best vermicelli.\r\n    It has a coarse appearance, and may be purchased at the Italian\r\n    warehouses. It is also called _soojee;_ and _semoletta_ is\r\n    another name for a finer sort.\r\n\r\nSOUP A LA SOLFERINO (Sardinian Recipe).\r\n\r\n154. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1/2 pint of cream, 2 oz. of fresh butter,\r\nsalt and pepper to taste, a little flour to thicken, 2 quarts of\r\nbouillon, No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat the eggs, put them into a stewpan, and add the cream,\r\nbutter, and seasoning; stir in as much flour as will bring it to the\r\nconsistency of dough; make it into balls, either round or egg-shaped,\r\nand fry them in butter; put them in the tureen, and pour the boiling\r\nbouillon over them.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 3d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This recipe was communicated to the Editress by an English\r\ngentleman, who was present at the battle of Solferino, on June 24, 1859,\r\nand who was requested by some of Victor Emmanuel's troops, on the day\r\nbefore the battle, to partake of a portion of their _potage_. He\r\nwillingly enough consented, and found that these clever campaigners had\r\nmade a most palatable dish from very easily-procured materials. In\r\nsending the recipe for insertion in this work, he has, however,\r\nAnglicised, and somewhat, he thinks, improved it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINACH SOUP (French Recipe).\r\n\r\n155. INGREDIENTS.--As much spinach as, when boiled, will half fill a\r\nvegetable-dish, 2 quarts of very clear medium stock, No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the cooked spinach into balls the size of an egg, and slip\r\nthem into the soup-tureen. This is a very elegant soup, the green of the\r\nspinach forming a pretty contrast to the brown gravy.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_,1s. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPINACH.]\r\n\r\n    SPINACH.--This plant was unknown by the ancients, although it\r\n    was cultivated in the monastic gardens of the continent in the\r\n    middle of the 14th century. Some say, that it was originally\r\n    brought from Spain; but there is a wild species growing in\r\n    England, and cultivated in Lincolnshire, in preference to the\r\n    other. There are three varieties in use; the round-leaved, the\r\n    triangular-leaved, and Flanders spinach, known by its large\r\n    leaves. They all form a useful ingredient in soup; but the\r\n    leaves are sometimes boiled alone, mashed, and eaten as greens.\r\n\r\nTAPIOCA SOUP.\r\n\r\n156. INGREDIENTS.--5 oz. of tapioca, 2 quarts of stock No. 105 or 106.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the tapioca into cold stock, and bring it gradually to a\r\nboil. Simmer gently till tender, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1 hour. Average cost. 1s. or 6d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n    TAPIOCA.--This excellent farinaceous food is the produce of the\r\n    pith of the cassava-tree, and is made in the East Indies, and\r\n    also in Brazil. It is, by washing, procured as a starch from the\r\n    tree, then dried, either in the sun or on plates of hot iron,\r\n    and afterwards broken into grains, in which form it is imported\r\n    into this country. Its nutritive properties are large, and as a\r\n    food for persons of delicate digestion, or for children, it is\r\n    in great estimation. \"No amylaceous substance,\" says Dr.\r\n    Christison, \"is so much relished by infants about the time of\r\n    weaning; and in them it is less apt to become sour during\r\n    digestion than any other farinaceous food, even arrowroot not\r\n    excepted.\"\r\n\r\nTURNIP SOUP.\r\n\r\n157. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of butter, 9 good-sized turnips, 4 onions, 2\r\nquarts of stock No. 106, seasoning to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Melt the butter in the stewpan, but do not let it boil; wash,\r\ndrain, and slice the turnips and onions very thin; put them in the\r\nbutter, with a teacupful of stock, and stew very gently for an hour.\r\nThen add the remainder of the stock, and simmer another hour. Rub it\r\nthrough a tammy, put it back into the stewpan, but do not let it boil.\r\nServe very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 8d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--By adding a little cream, this soup will be much improved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURNIP.]\r\n\r\n    THE TURNIP.--Although turnips grow wild in England, they are not\r\n    the original of the cultivated vegetable made use of in this\r\n    country. In ancient times they were grown for cattle by the\r\n    Romans, and in Germany and the Low Countries they have from time\r\n    immemorial been raised for the same purpose. In their cultivated\r\n    state, they are generally supposed to have been introduced to\r\n    England from Hanover, in the time of George I.; but this has\r\n    been doubted, as George II. caused a description of the Norfolk\r\n    system to be sent to his Hanoverian subjects, for their\r\n    enlightenment in the art of turnip culture. As a culinary\r\n    vegetable, it is excellent, whether eaten alone, mashed, or\r\n    mixed with soups und stews. Its nutritious matter, however, is\r\n    small, being only 42 parts in 1,000.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE-MARROW SOUP.\r\n\r\n158. INGREDIENTS.--4 young vegetable marrows, or more, if very small,\r\n1/2 pint of cream, salt and white pepper to taste, 2 quarts of white\r\nstock, No. 107.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare and slice the marrows, and put them in the stock boiling.\r\nWhen done almost to a mash, press them through a sieve, and at the\r\nmoment of serving, add the boiling cream and seasoning.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 2d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in summer.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE MARROW.]\r\n\r\n    THE VEGETABLE MARROW.--This is a variety of the gourd family,\r\n    brought from Persia by an East-India ship, and only recently\r\n    introduced to Britain. It is already cultivated to a\r\n    considerable extent, and, by many, is highly esteemed when fried\r\n    with butter. It is, however, dressed in different ways, either\r\n    by stewing or boiling, and, besides, made into pies.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE SOUP.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n159. INGREDIENTS.--7 oz. of carrot, 10 oz. of parsnip, 10 oz. of potato,\r\ncut into thin slices; 1-1/4 oz. of butter, 5 teaspoonfuls of flour, a\r\nteaspoonful of made mustard, salt and pepper to taste, the yolks of 2\r\neggs, rather more than 2 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the vegetables in the water 2-1/2 hours; stir them often,\r\nand if the water boils away too quickly, add more, as there should be 2\r\nquarts of soup when done. Mix up in a basin the butter and flour,\r\nmustard, salt, and pepper, with a teacupful of cold water; stir in the\r\nsoup, and boil 10 minutes. Have ready the yolks of the eggs in the\r\ntureen; pour on, stir well, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours. _Average cost_, 4d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n160.

If the liquor reduces too much, fill up with water.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--6-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 1-1/2d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The above recipe was used in the winter of 1858 by the\r\nEditress, who made, each week, in her copper, 8 or 9 gallons of this\r\nsoup, for distribution amongst about a dozen families of the village\r\nnear which she lives. The cost, as will be seen, was not great; but she\r\nhas reason to believe that the soup was very much liked, and gave to the\r\nmembers of those families, a dish of warm, comforting food, in place of\r\nthe cold meat and piece of bread which form, with too many cottagers,\r\ntheir usual meal, when, with a little more knowledge of the \"cooking.\"\r\nart, they might have, for less expense, a warm dish, every day.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAT, POULTRY, AND GAME SOUPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRILLA SOUP.\r\n\r\n166.

Its young leaves give\r\n    an agreeable flavour to soups and sauces; they are also used in\r\n    stuffings.\r\n\r\nCALF'S-HEAD SOUP.\r\n\r\n167. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 a calf's head, 1 onion stuck with cloves, a very\r\nsmall bunch of sweet herbs, 2 blades of mace, salt and white pepper to\r\ntaste, 6 oz. of rice-flour, 3 tablespoonfuls of ketchup, 3 quarts of\r\nwhite stock, No. 107, or pot-liquor, or water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the head with salt, soak it for 6 hours, and clean it\r\nthoroughly; put it in the stewpan, and cover it with the stock, or\r\npot-liquor, or water, adding the onion and sweet herbs.

When the giblets are done,\r\ntake them out, put them in your tureen, strain the soup through a sieve,\r\nadd the cream and butter, mixed with a dessert-spoonful of flour, boil\r\nit up a few minutes, and pour it over the giblets. It can be flavoured\r\nwith port wine and a little mushroom ketchup, instead of cream. Add salt\r\nto taste.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours. _Average cost_,9d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAVY SOUP.\r\n\r\n169.

When perfectly cold,\r\nyou can remove all the fat, and leave the sediment untouched, which\r\nserves very nicely for thick gravies, hashes, &c.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--7 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 14 persons.\r\n\r\n    ENDIVE.--This plant belongs to the acetarious tribe of\r\n    vegetables, and is supposed to have originally come from China\r\n    and Japan. It was known to the ancients; but was not introduced\r\n    to England till about the middle of the 16th century. It is\r\n    consumed in large quantities by the French, and in London,--in\r\n    the neighbourhood of which it is grown in abundance;--it is\r\n    greatly used as a winter salad, as well as in soups and stews.\r\n\r\nHARE SOUP.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n170. INGREDIENTS.--A hare fresh-killed, 1 lb. of lean gravy-beef, a\r\nslice of ham, 1 carrot, 2 onions, a faggot of savoury herbs, 1/4 oz. of\r\nwhole black pepper, a little browned flour, 1/4 pint of port wine, the\r\ncrumb of two French rolls, salt and cayenne to taste, 3 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Skin and paunch the hare, saving the liver and as much blood as\r\npossible.

Strain through a sieve, put the best parts of\r\nthe hare in the soup, and serve.\r\n\r\nOR,\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nProceed as above; but, instead of putting the joints of the hare in the\r\nsoup, pick the meat from the bones, pound it in a mortar, and add it,\r\nwith the crumb of two French rolls, to the soup. Rub all through a\r\nsieve; heat slowly, but do not let it boil. Send it to table\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n_Time_.-8 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 9d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to February.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARE.]\r\n\r\n    THE COMMON HARE.--This little animal is found throughout Europe,\r\n    and, indeed, in most of the northern parts of the world; and as\r\n    it is destitute of natural weapons of defence, Providence has\r\n    endowed it with an extraordinary amount of the passion of fear.\r\n    As if to awaken the vigilance of this passion, too, He has\r\n    furnished it with long and tubular ears, in order that it may\r\n    catch the remotest sounds; and with full, prominent eyes, which\r\n    enable it to see, at one and the same time, both before and\r\n    behind it. The hare feeds in the evenings, and sleeps, in its\r\n    form, during the day; and, as it generally lies on the ground,\r\n    its feet, both below and above, are protected with a thick\r\n    covering of hair. Its flesh, though esteemed by the Romans, was\r\n    forbidden by the Druids and by the earlier Britons. It is now,\r\n    though very dark and dry, and devoid of fat, much esteemed by\r\n    Europeans, on account of the peculiarity of its flavour. In\r\n    purchasing this animal, it ought to be remembered that both\r\n    hares and rabbits, when old, have their claws rugged and blunt,\r\n    their haunches thick, and their ears dry and tough. The ears of\r\n    a young hare easily tear, and it has a narrow cleft in the lip;\r\n    whilst its claws are both smooth and sharp.\r\n\r\nHESSIAN SOUP.\r\n\r\n171. INGREDIENTS.--Half an ox's head, 1 pint of split peas, 3 carrots, 6\r\nturnips, 6 potatoes, 6 onions, 1 head of celery, 1 bunch of savoury\r\nherbs, pepper and salt to taste, 2 blades of mace, a little allspice, 4\r\ncloves, the crumb of a French roll, 6 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clean the head, rub it with salt and water, and soak it for 5\r\nhours in warm water. Simmer it in the water till tender, put it into a\r\npan and let it cool; skim off all the fat; take out the head, and add\r\nthe vegetables cut up small, and the peas which have been previously\r\nsoaked; simmer them without the meat, till they are done enough to pulp\r\nthrough a sieve. Add the seasoning, with pieces of the meat cut up; give\r\none boil, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 hours. _Average cost_, 6d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 16 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--An excellent hash or _ragoût_ can be made by cutting up the\r\nnicest parts of the head, thickening and seasoning more highly a little\r\nof the soup, and adding a glass of port wine and 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\nketchup.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOCK TURTLE.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n172. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 a calf's head, 1/4 lb. of butter, 1/4 lb. of lean\r\nham, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, a little minced lemon thyme,\r\nsweet marjoram, basil, 2 onions, a few chopped mushrooms (when\r\nobtainable), 2 shallots, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1/4 bottle of\r\nMadeira or sherry, force-meat balls, cayenne, salt and mace to taste,\r\nthe juice of 1 lemon and 1 Seville orange, 1 dessert-spoonful of pounded\r\nsugar, 3 quarts of best stock, No. 104.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scald the head with the skin on, remove the brain, tie the head\r\nup in a cloth, and let it boil for 1 hour. Then take the meat from the\r\nbones, cut it into small square pieces, and throw them into cold water.\r\nNow take the meat, put it into a stewpan, and cover with stock; let it\r\nboil gently for an hour, or rather more, if not quite tender, and set it\r\non one side. Melt the butter in another stewpan, and add the ham, cut\r\nsmall, with the herbs, parsley, onions, shallots, mushrooms, and nearly\r\na pint of stock; let these simmer slowly for 2 hours, and then dredge in\r\nas much flour as will dry up the butter. Fill up with the remainder of\r\nthe stock, add the wine, let it stew gently for 10 minutes, rub it\r\nthrough a tammy, and put it to the calf's head; season with cayenne,\r\nand, if required, a little salt; add the juice of the orange and lemon;\r\nand when liked, 1/4 teaspoonful of pounded mace, and the sugar. Put in\r\nthe force-meat balls, simmer 5 minutes, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 3s. 6d. per quart, or 2s. 6d.\r\nwithout wine or force-meat balls.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The bones of the head should be well stewed in the liquor it\r\nwas first boiled in, and will make good white stock, flavoured with\r\nvegetables, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n(_More Economical_.)\r\n\r\n173. INGREDIENTS.--A knuckle of veal weighing 5 or 6 lbs., 2 cow-heels,\r\n2 large onions stuck with cloves, 1 bunch of sweet herbs, 3 blades of\r\nmace, salt to taste, 12 peppercorns, 1 glass of sherry, 24 force-meat\r\nballs, a little lemon-juice, 4 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients, except the force-meat balls and\r\nlemon-juice, in an earthen jar, and stew for 6 hours. Do not open it\r\ntill cold. When wanted for use, skim off all the fat, and strain\r\ncarefully; place it on the fire, cut up the meat into inch-and-a-half\r\nsquares, put it, with the force-meat balls and lemon-juice, into the\r\nsoup, and serve. It can be flavoured with a tablespoonful of anchovy, or\r\nHarvey's sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--6 hours. _Average cost_,1s. 4d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n    THE CALF--The flesh of this animal is called veal, and when\r\n    young, that is, under two months old, yields a large quantity of\r\n    soluble extract, and is, therefore, much employed for soups and\r\n    broths. The Essex farmers have obtained a celebrity for\r\n    fattening calves better than any others in England, where they\r\n    are plentifully supplied with milk, a thing impossible to be\r\n    done in the immediate neighbourhood of London.\r\n\r\n    MARJORAM.--There are several species of this plant; but that\r\n    which is preferred for cookery is a native of Portugal, and is\r\n    called sweet or knotted marjoram. When its leaves are dried,\r\n    they have an agreeable aromatic flavour; and hence are used for\r\n    soups, stuffings, &c.\r\n\r\n    BASIL.--This is a native of the East Indies, and is highly\r\n    aromatic, having a perfume greatly resembling that of cloves. It\r\n    is not much employed in English cookery, but is a favourite with\r\n    French cooks, by whom its leaves are used in soups and salads.\r\n\r\nMULLAGATAWNY SOUP.\r\n\r\n174. INGREDIENTS.--2 tablespoonfuls of curry powder, 6 onions, 1 clove\r\nof garlic, 1 oz. of pounded almonds, a little lemon-pickle, or\r\nmango-juice, to taste; 1 fowl or rabbit, 4 slices of lean bacon; 2\r\nquarts of medium stock, or, if wanted very good, best stock.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.-=Slice and fry the onions of a nice colour; line the stewpan\r\nwith the bacon; cut up the rabbit or fowl into small joints, and\r\nslightly brown them; put in the fried onions, the garlic, and stock, and\r\nsimmer gently till the meat is tender; skim very carefully, and when the\r\nmeat is done, rub the curry powder to a smooth batter; add it to the\r\nsoup with the almonds, which must be first pounded with a little of the\r\nstock. Put in seasoning and lemon-pickle or mango-juice to taste, and\r\nserve boiled rice with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d. per quart, with stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This soup can also be made with breast of veal, or calf's head.\r\nVegetable Mullagatawny is made with veal stock, by boiling and pulping\r\nchopped vegetable marrow, cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes, and seasoning\r\nwith curry powder and cayenne. Nice pieces of meat, good curry powder,\r\nand strong stock, are necessary to make this soup good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORIANDER.]\r\n\r\n    CORIANDER.--This plant, which largely enters into the\r\n    composition of curry powder with turmeric, originally comes from\r\n    the East; but it has long been cultivated in England, especially\r\n    in Essex, where it is reared for the use of confectioners and\r\n    druggists. In private gardens, it is cultivated for the sake of\r\n    its tender leaves, which are highly aromatic, and are employed\r\n    in soups and salads. Its seeds are used in large quantities for\r\n    the purposes of distillation.\r\n\r\nA GOOD MUTTON SOUP.\r\n\r\n175. INGREDIENTS.--A neck of mutton about 5 or 6 lbs., 3 carrots, 3\r\nturnips, 2 onions, a large bunch of sweet herbs, including parsley; salt\r\nand pepper to taste; a little sherry, if liked; 3 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Lay the ingredients in a covered pan before the fire, and let\r\nthem remain there the whole day, stirring occasionally. The next day put\r\nthe whole into a stewpan, and place it on a brisk fire. When it\r\ncommences to boil, take the pan off the fire, and put it on one side to\r\nsimmer until the meat is done. When ready for use, take out the meat,\r\ndish it up with carrots and turnips, and send it to table; strain the\r\nsoup, let it cool, skim off all the fat, season and thicken it with a\r\ntablespoonful, or rather more, of arrowroot; flavour with a little\r\nsherry, simmer for 5 minutes, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 hours. _Average cost_, including the meat, 1s. 3d. per\r\nquart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n    THE SHEEP.--This animal formed the principal riches of the\r\n    patriarchs, in the days of old, and, no doubt, multiplied, until\r\n    its species were spread over the greater part of Western Asia;\r\n    but at what period it was introduced to Britain is not known. It\r\n    is now found in almost every part of the globe, although, as a\r\n    domestic animal, it depends almost entirely upon man for its\r\n    support. Its value, however, amply repays him for whatever care\r\n    and kindness he may bestow upon it; for, like the ox, there is\r\n    scarcely a part of it that he cannot convert to some useful\r\n    purpose. The fleece, which serves it for a covering, is\r\n    appropriated by man, to serve the same end to himself, whilst\r\n    its skin is also applied to various purposes in civilized life.\r\n    Its entrails are used as strings for musical instruments, and\r\n    its bones are calcined, and employed as tests in the trade of\r\n    the refiner. Its milk, being thicker than that of the cow,\r\n    yields a greater quantity of butter and cheese, and its flesh is\r\n    among the most wholesome and nutritive that can be eaten.\r\n    Thomson has beautifully described the appearance of the sheep,\r\n    when bound to undergo the operation of being shorn of its wool.\r\n\r\n      \"Behold, where bound, and of its robe bereft\r\n      By needy man, that all-depending lord,\r\n      How meek, how patient, the mild creature lies!\r\n      What softness in his melancholy face,\r\n      What dumb complaining innocence appears!\"\r\n\r\nOX-CHEEK SOUP.\r\n\r\n176. INGREDIENTS.--An ox-cheek, 2 oz. of butter, 3 or 4 slices of lean\r\nham or bacon, 1 parsnip, 3 carrots, 2 onions, 3 heads of celery, 3\r\nblades of mace, 4 cloves, a faggot of savoury herbs, 1 bay-leaf, a\r\nteaspoonful of salt, half that of pepper, 1 head of celery, browning,\r\nthe crust of a French roll, 6 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Lay the ham in the bottom of the stewpan, with the butter;\r\nbreak the bones of the cheek, wash it clean, and put it on the ham. Cut\r\nthe vegetables small, add them to the other ingredients, and set the\r\nwhole over a slow fire for 1/4 of an hour. Now put in the water, and\r\nsimmer gently till it is reduced to 4 quarts; take out the fleshy part\r\nof the cheek, and strain the soup into a clean stewpan; thicken with\r\nflour, put in a head of sliced celery, and simmer till the celery is\r\ntender. If not a good colour, use a little browning. Cut the meat into\r\nsmall square pieces, pour the soup over, and serve with the crust of a\r\nFrench roll in the tureen. A glass of sherry much improves this soup.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 to 4 hours. _Average cost_, 8d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 12 persons.\r\n\r\n    THE OX.--Of the quadrupedal animals, the flesh of those that\r\n    feed upon herbs is the most wholesome and nutritious for human\r\n    food. In the early ages, the ox was used as a religious\r\n    sacrifice, and, in the eyes of the Egyptians was deemed so\r\n    sacred as to be worthy of exaltation to represent Taurus, one of\r\n    the twelve signs of the zodiac. To this day, the Hindoos\r\n    venerate the cow, whose flesh is forbidden to be eaten, and\r\n    whose fat, supposed to have been employed to grease the\r\n    cartridges of the Indian army, was one of the proximate causes\r\n    of the great Sepoy rebellion of 1857. There are no animals of\r\n    greater use to man than the tribe to which the ox belongs. There\r\n    is hardly a part of them that does not enter into some of the\r\n    arts and purposes of civilized life. Of their horns are made\r\n    combs, knife-handles, boxes, spoons, and drinking-cups. They are\r\n    also made into transparent plates for lanterns; an invention\r\n    ascribed, in England, to King Alfred. Glue is made from their\r\n    gristles, cartilages, and portions of their hides. Their bones\r\n    often form a substitute for ivory; their skins, when calves, are\r\n    manufactured into vellum; their blood is the basis of Prussian\r\n    blue; their sinews furnish fine and strong threads, used by\r\n    saddlers; their hair enters into various manufactures; their\r\n    tallow is made into candles; their flesh is eaten, and the\r\n    utility of the milk and cream of the cow is well known.\r\n\r\nOX-TAIL SOUP.\r\n\r\n177. INGREDIENTS.--2 ox-tails, 2 slices of ham, 1 oz. of butter, 2\r\ncarrots, 2 turnips, 3 onions, 1 leek, 1 head of celery, 1 bunch of\r\nsavoury herbs, 1 bay-leaf, 12 whole peppercorns, 4 cloves, a\r\ntablespoonful of salt, 2 tablespoonfuls of ketchup, 1/2 glass of port\r\nwine, 3 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the tails, separating them at the joints; wash them, and\r\nput them in a stewpan, with the butter. Cut the vegetables in slices,\r\nand add them, with the peppercorns and herbs. Put in 1/2 pint of water,\r\nand stir it over a sharp fire till the juices are drawn. Fill up the\r\nstewpan with the water, and, when boiling, add the salt. Skim well, and\r\nsimmer very gently for 4 hours, or until the tails are tender. Take them\r\nout, skim and strain the soup, thicken with flour, and flavour with the\r\nketchup and port wine. Put back the tails, simmer for 5 minutes, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 3d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTRIDGE SOUP.\r\n\r\n178. INGREDIENTS.--2 partridges, 3 slices of lean ham, 2 shred onions, 1\r\nhead of celery, 1 large carrot, and 1 turnip cut into any fanciful\r\nshapes, 1 small lump of sugar, 2 oz. of butter, salt and pepper to\r\ntaste, 2 quarts of stock No. 105, or common, No. 106.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the partridges into pieces, and braise them in the butter\r\nand ham until quite tender; then take out the legs, wings, and breast,\r\nand set them by. Keep the backs and other trimmings in the braise, and\r\nadd the onions and celery; any remains of cold game can be put in, and 3\r\npints of stock. Simmer slowly for 1 hour, strain it, and skim the fat\r\noff as clean as possible; put in the pieces that were taken out, give it\r\none boil, and skim again to have it quite clear, and add the sugar and\r\nseasoning. Now simmer the cut carrot and turnip in 1 pint of stock; when\r\nquite tender, put them to the partridges, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 2s. or 1s. 6d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to February.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The meat of the partridges may be pounded with the crumb of a\r\nFrench roll, and worked with the soup through a sieve. Serve with stewed\r\ncelery cut in slices, and put in the tureen.\r\n\r\n    THE PARTRIDGE.--This is a timorous bird, being easily taken. It\r\n    became known to the Greeks and Romans, whose tables it helped to\r\n    furnish with food. Formerly, the Red was scarce in Italy, but\r\n    its place was supplied by the White, which, at considerable\r\n    expense, was frequently procured from the Alps. The Athenians\r\n    trained this bird for fighting, and Severus used to lighten the\r\n    cares of royalty by witnessing the spirit of its combats. The\r\n    Greeks esteemed its leg most highly, and rejected the other\r\n    portions as unfashionable to be eaten. The Romans, however,\r\n    ventured a little further, and ate the breast, whilst we\r\n    consider the bird as wholly palatable. It is an inhabitant of\r\n    all the temperate countries of Europe, but, on account of the\r\n    geniality of the climate, it abounds most in the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nPHEASANT SOUP.\r\n\r\n179. INGREDIENTS.--2 pheasants, 1/4 lb. of butter, 2 slices of ham, 2\r\nlarge onions sliced, 1/2 head of celery, the crumb of two French rolls,\r\nthe yolks of 2 eggs boiled hard, salt and cayenne to taste, a little\r\npounded mace, if liked; 3 quarts of stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the pheasants, flour and braise them in the butter and\r\nham till they are of a nice brown, but not burnt. Put them in a stewpan,\r\nwith the onions, celery, and seasoning, and simmer for 2 hours. Strain\r\nthe soup; pound the breasts with the crumb of the roll previously\r\nsoaked, and the yolks of the eggs; put it to the soup, give one boil,\r\nand serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 2s. 10d. per quart, or, if made\r\nwith fragments of gold game, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to February.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Fragments, pieces and bones of cold game, may be used to great\r\nadvantage in this soup, and then 1 pheasant will suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTABLE SOUP.\r\n\r\n180. INGREDIENTS.--2 knuckles of veal, 3 shins of beef, 1 large faggot\r\nof herbs, 2 bay-leaves, 2 heads of celery, 3 onions, 3 carrots, 2 blades\r\nof mace, 6 cloves, a teaspoonful of salt, sufficient water to cover all\r\nthe ingredients.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take the marrow from the bones; put all the ingredients in a\r\nstock-pot, and simmer slowly for 12 hours, or more, if the meat be not\r\ndone to rags; strain it off, and put it in a very cool place; take off\r\nall the fat, reduce the liquor in a shallow pan, by setting it over a\r\nsharp fire, but be particular that it does not burn; boil it fast and\r\nuncovered for 8 hours, and keep it stirred. Put it into a deep dish, and\r\nset it by for a day. Have ready a stewpan of boiling water, place the\r\ndish in it, and keep it boiling; stir occasionally, and when the soup is\r\nthick and ropy, it is done. Form it into little cakes by pouring a small\r\nquantity on to the bottom of cups or basins; when cold, turn them out on\r\na flannel to dry. Keep them from the air in tin canisters.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ of this quantity, 16s.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Soup can be made in 5 minutes with this, by dissolving a small\r\npiece, about the size of a walnut, in a pint of warm water, and\r\nsimmering for 2 minutes. Vermicelli, macaroni, or other Italian pastes,\r\nmay be added.\r\n\r\n    THE LAUREL or BAY.--The leaves of this tree frequently enter\r\n    into the recipes of cookery; but they ought not to be used\r\n    without the greatest caution, and not at all unless the cook is\r\n    perfectly aware of their effects. It ought to be known, that\r\n    there are two kinds of bay-trees,--the Classic laurel, whose\r\n    leaves are comparatively harmless, and the Cherry-laurel, which\r\n    is the one whose leaves are employed in cookery. They have a\r\n    kernel-like flavour, and are used in blanc-mange, puddings,\r\n    custards &c.; but when acted upon by water, they develop prussic\r\n    acid, and, therefore, but a small number of the leaves should be\r\n    used at a time.\r\n\r\nRABBIT SOUP.\r\n\r\n181. INGREDIENTS.--2 large rabbits, or 3 small ones; a faggot of savoury\r\nherbs, 1/2 head of celery, 2 carrots, 1 onion, 1 blade of mace, salt and\r\nwhite pepper to taste, a little pounded mace, 1/2 pint of cream, the\r\nyolks of 2 eggs boiled hard, the crumb of a French roll, nearly 3 quarts\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the soup with the legs and shoulders of the rabbit, and\r\nkeep the nice pieces for a dish or _entrée_. Put them into warm water,\r\nand draw the blood; when quite clean, put them in a stewpan, with a\r\nfaggot of herbs, and a teacupful, or rather more, of veal stock or\r\nwater. Simmer slowly till done through, and add the 3 quarts of water,\r\nand boil for an hour. Take out the rabbet, pick the meat from the bones,\r\ncovering it up to keep it white; put the bones back in the liquor, add\r\nthe vegetables, and simmer for 2 hours; skim and strain, and let it\r\ncool. Now pound the meat in a mortar, with the yolks of the eggs, and\r\nthe crumb of the roll previously soaked; rub it through a tammy, and\r\ngradually add it to the strained liquor, and simmer for 15 minutes. Mix\r\narrowroot or rice-flour with the cream (say 2 dessert-spoonfuls), and\r\nstir in the soup; bring it to a boil, and serve. This soup must be very\r\nwhite, and instead of thickening it with arrowroot or rice-flour,\r\nvermicelli or pearl barley can be boiled in a little stock, and put in 5\r\nminutes before serving.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Nearly 4 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGENCY SOUP.\r\n\r\n182.

Wash the barley, and boil it in 2 or 3\r\nwaters before putting it to the soup; finish simmering in the soup, and\r\nwhen the barley is done, take out half, and pound the other half with\r\nthe yolks of the eggs. When you have finished pounding, rub it through a\r\nclean tammy, add the cream, and salt if necessary; give one boil, and\r\nserve very hot, putting in the barley that was taken out first.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. per quart, if made with medium\r\nstock, or 6d. per quart, with common stock.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUP A LA REINE.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n183.

When beaten enough, put the meat back in the stock, with the\r\ncrumb of the rolls, and let it simmer for an hour; rub it through a\r\ntammy, add the sugar, 1/2 pint of cream that has boiled, and, if you\r\nprefer, cut the crust of the roll into small round pieces, and pour the\r\nsoup over it, when you serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours, or rather more. _Average cost_, 2s. 7d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--All white soups should be warmed in a vessel placed in another\r\nof boiling water. (_See_ BAIN MARIE, No. 87.)\r\n\r\n\r\nII. (Economical.)\r\n\r\n184. INGREDIENTS.--Any remains of roast chickens, 1/2 teacupful of rice,\r\nsalt and pepper to taste, 1 quart of stock No. 106.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take all the white meat and pound it with the rice, which has\r\nbeen slightly cooked, but not much. When it is all well pounded, dilute\r\nwith the stock, and pass through a sieve.

Now add the vegetables, cut in thin small slices; season,\r\nand boil for 1 hour. Thicken with the oatmeal, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 3d. per quart without the meat.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--If rice is used instead of oatmeal, put it in with the\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEW SOUP.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n186. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of beef, 5 onions, 5 turnips, 3/4 lb. of\r\n_rice_, a large bunch of parsley, a few sweet herbs, pepper and salt, 2\r\nquarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the beef up in small pieces, add the other ingredients, and\r\nboil gently for 21/2 hours.

They are very fond of the seeds of nettles,\r\n    and the seeds of the foxglove poison them.\r\n\r\nTURTLE SOUP (founded on M. Ude's Recipe).\r\n\r\n189. INGREDIENTS.--A turtle, 6 slices of ham, 2 knuckles of veal, 1\r\nlarge bunch of sweet herbs, 3 bay-leaves, parsley, green onions, 1\r\nonion, 6 cloves, 4 blades of mace, 1/4 lb. of fresh butter, 1 bottle of\r\nMadeira, 1 lump of sugar. For the _Quenelles à Tortue_, 1 lb. of veal, 1\r\nlb. of bread crumbs, milk, 7 eggs, cayenne, salt, spices, chopped\r\nparsley, the juice of 2 lemons.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--To make this soup with less difficulty, cut off the head of the\r\nturtle the preceding day. In the morning open the turtle by leaning\r\nheavily with a knife on the shell of the animal's back, whilst you cut\r\nthis off all round. Turn it upright on its end, that all the water, &c.\r\nmay run out, when the flesh should be cut off along the spine, with the\r\nknife sloping towards the bones, for fear of touching the gall, which\r\nsometimes might escape the eye. When all the flesh about the members is\r\nobtained, wash these clean, and let them drain. Have ready, on the fire,\r\na large vessel full of boiling water, into which put the shells; and\r\nwhen you perceive that they come easily off, take them out of the water,\r\nand prick them all, with those of the back, belly, fins, head, &c. Boil\r\nthe back and belly till the bones can be taken off, without, however,\r\nallowing the softer parts to be sufficiently done, as they will be\r\nboiled again in the soup. When these latter come off easily, lay them on\r\nearthen dishes singly, for fear they should stick together, and put them\r\nto cool. Keep the liquor in which you have blanched the softer parts,\r\nand let the bones stew thoroughly in it, as this liquor must be used to\r\nmoisten all the sauces.\r\n\r\nAll the flesh of the interior parts, the four legs and head, must be\r\ndrawn down in the following manner:--Lay the slices of ham on the bottom\r\nof a very large stewpan, over them the knuckles of veal, according to\r\nthe size of the turtle; then the inside flesh of the turtle, and over\r\nthe whole the members. Now moisten with the water in which you are\r\nboiling the shell, and draw it down thoroughly. It may now be\r\nascertained if it be thoroughly done by thrusting a knife into the\r\nfleshy part of the meat. If no blood appears, it is time to moisten it\r\nagain with the liquor in which the bones, &c. have been boiling. Put in\r\na large bunch of all such sweet herbs as are used in the cooking of a\r\nturtle,--sweet basil, sweet marjoram, lemon thyme, winter savory, 2 or 3\r\nbay-leaves, common thyme, a handful of parsley and green onions, and a\r\nlarge onion stuck with 6 cloves. Let the whole be thoroughly done. With\r\nrespect to the members, probe them, to see whether they are done, and if\r\nso, drain and send them to the larder, as they are to make their\r\nappearance only when the soup is absolutely completed. When the flesh is\r\nalso completely done, strain it through a silk sieve, and make a very\r\nthin white _roux;_ for turtle soup must not be much thickened. When the\r\nflour is sufficiently done on a slow fire, and has a good colour,\r\nmoisten it with the liquor, keeping it over the fire till it boils.\r\nAscertain that the sauce is neither too thick nor too thin; then draw\r\nthe stewpan on the side of the stove, to skim off the white scum, and\r\nall the fat and oil that rise to the surface of the sauce. By this time\r\nall the softer parts will be sufficiently cold; when they must be cut to\r\nabout the size of one or two inches square, and thrown into the soup,\r\nwhich must now be left to simmer gently. When done, skim off all the fat\r\nand froth. Take all the leaves of the herbs from the stock,--sweet\r\nbasil, sweet marjoram, lemon thyme, winter savory, 2 or 3 bay-leaves,\r\ncommon thyme, a handful of parsley and green onions, and a large onion\r\ncut in four pieces, with a few blades of mace. Put these in a stewpan,\r\nwith about 1/4 lb. of fresh butter, and let it simmer on a slow fire\r\ntill quite melted, when pour in 1 bottle of good Madeira, adding a small\r\nbit of sugar, and let it boil gently for 1 hour. When done, rub it\r\nthrough a tammy, and add it to the soup. Let this boil, till no white\r\nscum rises; then take with a skimmer all the bits of turtle out of the\r\nsauce, and put them in a clean stewpan: when you have all out, pour the\r\nsoup over the bits of turtle, through a tammy, and proceed as follows:--\r\n\r\nQUENELLES À TORTUE.--Make some _quenelles à tortue_, which being\r\nsubstitutes for eggs, do not require to be very delicate. Take out the\r\nfleshy part of a leg of veal, about 1 lb., scrape off all the meat,\r\nwithout leaving any sinews or fat, and soak in milk about the same\r\nquantity of crumbs of bread. When the bread is well soaked, squeeze it,\r\nand put it into a mortar, with the veal, a small quantity of calf's\r\nudder, a little butter, the yolks of 4 eggs, boiled hard, a little\r\ncayenne pepper, salt, and spices, and pound the whole very fine; then\r\nthicken the mixture with 2 whole eggs, and the yolk of another. Next try\r\nthis _farce_ or stuffing in boiling-hot water, to ascertain its\r\nconsistency: if it is too thin, add the yolk of an egg. When the _farce_\r\nis perfected, take half of it, and put into it some chopped parsley. Let\r\nthe whole cool, in order to roll it of the size of the yolk of an egg;\r\npoach it in salt and boiling water, and when very hard, drain on a\r\nsieve, and put it into the turtle. Before you send up, squeeze the juice\r\nof 2 or 3 lemons, with a little cayenne pepper, and pour that into the\r\nsoup. THE FINS may be served as a _plat d'entrée_ with a little turtle\r\nsauce; if not, on the following day you may warm the turtle _au bain\r\nmarie_, and serve the members entire, with a _matelote_ sauce, garnished\r\nwith mushrooms, cocks' combs, _quenelles_, &c. When either lemon-juice\r\nor cayenne pepper has been introduced, no boiling must take place.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--It is necessary to observe, that the turtle prepared a day\r\nbefore it is used, is generally preferable, the flavour being more\r\nuniform. Be particular, when you dress a very large turtle, to preserve\r\nthe green fat (be cautious not to study a very brown colour,--the\r\nnatural green of the fish is preferred by every epicure and true\r\nconnoisseur) in a separate stewpan, and likewise when the turtle is\r\nentirely done, to have as many tureens as you mean to serve each time.\r\nYou cannot put the whole in a large vessel, for many reasons: first, it\r\nwill be long in cooling; secondly, when you take some out, it will break\r\nall the rest into rags. If you warm in a _bain marie_, the turtle will\r\nalways retain the same taste; but if you boil it often, it becomes\r\nstrong, and loses the delicacy of its flavour.\r\n\r\nTHE COST OF TURTLE SOUP.--This is the most expensive soup brought to\r\ntable. It is sold by the quart,--one guinea being the standard price for\r\nthat quantity. The price of live turtle ranges from 8d. to 2s. per lb.,\r\naccording to supply and demand. When live turtle is dear, many cooks use\r\nthe tinned turtle, which is killed when caught, and preserved by being\r\nput in hermetically-sealed canisters, and so sent over to England. The\r\ncost of a tin, containing 2 quarts, or 4 lbs., is about £2, and for a\r\nsmall one, containing the green fat, 7s. 6d. From these about 6 quarts\r\nof good soup may be made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TURTLE.]\r\n\r\n    THE GREEN TURTLE.--This reptile is found in large numbers on the\r\n    coasts of all the islands and continents within the tropics, in\r\n    both the old and new worlds. Their length is often five feet and\r\n    upwards, and they range in weight from 50 to 500 or 600 lbs. As\r\n    turtles find a constant supply of food on the coasts which they\r\n    frequent, they are not of a quarrelsome disposition, as the\r\n    submarine meadows in which they pasture, yield plenty for them\r\n    all. Like other species of amphibia, too, they have the power of\r\n    living many months without food; so that they live harmlessly\r\n    and peaceably together, notwithstanding that they seem to have\r\n    no common bond of association, but merely assemble in the same\r\n    places as if entirely by accident. England is mostly supplied\r\n    with them from the West Indies, whence they are brought alive\r\n    and in tolerable health. The green turtle is highly prized on\r\n    account of the delicious quality of its flesh, the fat of the\r\n    upper and lower shields of the animal being esteemed the richest\r\n    and most delicate parts. The soup, however, is apt to disagree\r\n    with weak stomachs. As an article of luxury, the turtle has only\r\n    come into fashion within the last 100 years, and some hundreds\r\n    of tureens of turtle soup are served annually at the lord\r\n    mayor's dinner in Guildhall.\r\n\r\nA GOOD FAMILY SOUP.\r\n\r\n190. INGREDIENTS.--Remains of a cold tongue, 2 lbs. of shin of beef, any\r\ncold pieces of meat or beef-bones, 2 turnips, 2 carrots, 2 onions, 1\r\nparsnip, 1 head of celery, 4 quarts of water, 1/2 teacupful of rice;\r\nsalt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients in a stewpan, and simmer gently for 4\r\nhours, or until all the goodness is drawn from the meat. Strain off the\r\nsoup, and let it stand to get cold. The kernels and soft parts of the\r\ntongue must be saved. When the soup is wanted for use, skim off all the\r\nfat, put in the kernels and soft parts of the tongue, slice in a small\r\nquantity of fresh carrot, turnip, and onion; stew till the vegetables\r\nare tender, and serve with toasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 hours. __Average cost_,3d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 12 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nHODGE-PODGE.\r\n\r\n191. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of shin of beef, 3 quarts of water, 1 pint of\r\ntable-beer, 2 onions, 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 1 head of celery; pepper and\r\nsalt to taste; thickening of butter and flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the meat, beer, and water in a stewpan; simmer for a few\r\nminutes, and skim carefully. Add the vegetables and seasoning; stew\r\ngently till the meat is tender. Thicken with the butter and flour, and\r\nserve with turnips and carrots, or spinach and celery.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours, or rather more. _Average cost_, 3d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time. _Sufficient_ for 12 persons.\r\n\r\n    TABLE BEER.--This is nothing more than a weak ale, and is not\r\n    made so much with a view to strength, as to transparency of\r\n    colour and an agreeable bitterness of taste. It is, or ought to\r\n    be, manufactured by the London professional brewers, from the\r\n    best pale malt, or amber and malt. Six barrels are usually drawn\r\n    from one quarter of malt, with which are mixed 4 or 5 lbs. of\r\n    hops. As a beverage, it is agreeable when fresh; but it is not\r\n    adapted to keep long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH SOUPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH STOCK.\r\n\r\n192. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of beef or veal (these can be omitted), any\r\nkind of white fish trimmings, of fish which are to be dressed for table,\r\n2 onions, the rind of 1/2 a lemon, a bunch of sweet herbs, 2 carrots, 2\r\nquarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the fish, and put it, with the other ingredients, into\r\nthe water. Simmer for 2 hours; skim the liquor carefully, and strain it.\r\nWhen a richer stock is wanted, fry the vegetables and fish before adding\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, with meat, 10d. per quart; without,\r\n3d.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Do not make fish stock long before it is wanted, as it soon\r\nturns sour.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAYFISH SOUP.\r\n\r\n193. INGREDIENTS.--50 crayfish, 1/4 lb. of butter, 6 anchovies, the\r\ncrumb of 1 French roll, a little lobster-spawn, seasoning to taste, 2\r\nquarts of medium stock, No. 105, or fish stock, No. 192.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Shell the crayfish, and put the fish between two plates until\r\nthey are wanted; pound the shells in a mortar, with the butter and\r\nanchovies; when well beaten, add a pint of stock, and simmer for 3/4 of\r\nan hour. Strain it through a hair sieve, put the remainder of the stock\r\nto it, with the crumb of the rolls; give it one boil, and rub it through\r\na tammy, with the lobster-spawn. Put in the fish, but do not let the\r\nsoup boil, after it has been rubbed through the tammy. If necessary, add\r\nseasoning.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 2s. 3d. or 1s. 9d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from January to July.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRAYFISH.]\r\n\r\n    THE CRAYFISH.--This is one of those fishes that were highly\r\n    esteemed by the ancients. The Greeks preferred it when brought\r\n    from Alexandria, and the Romans ate it boiled with cumin, and\r\n    seasoned with pepper and other condiments. A recipe tells us,\r\n    that crayfish can be preserved several days in baskets with\r\n    fresh grass, such as the nettle, or in a bucket with about\r\n    three-eighths of an inch of water. More water would kill them,\r\n    because the large quantity of air they require necessitates the\r\n    water in which they are kept, to be continually renewed.\r\n\r\nEEL SOUP.\r\n\r\n194. INGREDIENTS.--3 lbs. of eels, 1 onion, 2 oz. of butter, 3 blades of\r\nmace, 1 bunch of sweet herbs, 1/4 oz. of peppercorns, salt to taste, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of flour, 1/4 pint of cream, 2 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the eels, cut them into thin slices, and put them in the\r\nstewpan with the butter; let them simmer for a few minutes, then pour\r\nthe water to them, and add the onion, cut in thin slices, the herbs,\r\nmace, and seasoning. Simmer till the eels are tender, but do not break\r\nthe fish. Take them out carefully, mix the flour smoothly to a batter\r\nwith the cream, bring it to a boil, pour over the eels, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour, or rather more. _Average cost_, 10d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This soup may be flavoured differently by omitting the cream,\r\nand adding a little ketchup or Harvey's sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOBSTER SOUP.\r\n\r\n195. INGREDIENTS.--3 large lobsters, or 6 small ones; the crumb of a\r\nFrench roll, 2 anchovies, 1 onion, 1 small bunch of sweet herbs, 1 strip\r\nof lemon-peel, 2 oz. of butter, a little nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful of flour,\r\n1 pint of cream, 1 pint of milk; forcemeat balls, mace, salt and pepper\r\nto taste, bread crumbs, 1 egg, 2 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the meat from the lobsters, and beat the fins, chine, and\r\nsmall claws in a mortar, previously taking away the brown fin and the\r\nbag in the head. Put it in a stewpan, with the crumb of the roll,\r\nanchovies, onions, herbs, lemon-peel, and the water; simmer gently till\r\nall the goodness is extracted, and strain it off. Pound the spawn in a\r\nmortar, with the butter, nutmeg, and flour, and mix with it the cream\r\nand milk. Give one boil up, at the same time adding the tails cut in\r\npieces. Make the forcemeat balls with the remainder of the lobster,\r\nseasoned with mace, pepper, and salt, adding a little flour, and a few\r\nbread crumbs; moisten them with the egg, heat them in the soup, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours, or rather more. _Average cost_, 3s 6d per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to October.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nOYSTER SOUP.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n196. INGREDIENTS.--6 dozen of oysters, 2 quarts of white stock, 1/2 pint\r\nof cream, 2 oz. of butter, 1-1/2 oz. of flour; salt, cayenne, and mace\r\nto taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scald the oysters in their own liquor; take them out, beard\r\nthem, and put them in a tureen. Take a pint of the stock, put in the\r\nbeards and the liquor, which must be carefully strained, and simmer for\r\n1/2 an hour. Take it off the fire, strain it again, and add the\r\nremainder of the stock with the seasoning and mace. Bring it to a boil,\r\nadd the thickening of butter and flour, simmer for 5 minutes, stir in\r\nthe boiling cream, pour it over the oysters, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, 2s. 8d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This soup can be made less rich by using milk instead of cream,\r\nand thickening with arrowroot instead of butter and flour.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n197. INGREDIENTS.--2 quarts of good mutton broth, 6 dozen oysters, 2 oz.\r\nbutter, 1 oz. of flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beard the oysters, and scald them in their own liquor; then add\r\nit, well strained, to the broth; thicken with the butter and flour, and\r\nsimmer for 1/4 of an hour. Put in the oysters, stir well, but do not let\r\nit boil, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 2s. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n    SEASON OF OYSTERS.--From April and May to the end of July,\r\n    oysters are said to be sick; but by the end of August they\r\n    become healthy, having recovered from the effects of spawning.\r\n    When they are not in season, the males have a black, and the\r\n    females a milky substance in the gill. From some lines of\r\n    Oppian, it would appear that the ancients were ignorant that the\r\n    oyster is generally found adhering to rocks. The starfish is one\r\n    of the most deadly enemies of these bivalves. The poet says:--\r\n\r\n      The prickly star creeps on with full deceit\r\n      To force the oyster from his close retreat.\r\n      When gaping lids their widen'd void display,\r\n      The watchful star thrusts in a pointed ray,\r\n      Of all its treasures spoils the rifled case,\r\n      And empty shells the sandy hillock grace.\r\n\r\nPRAWN SOUP.\r\n\r\n198. INGREDIENTS.--2 quarts of fish stock or water, 2 pints of prawns,\r\nthe crumbs of a French roll, anchovy sauce or mushroom ketchup to taste,\r\n1 blade of mace, 1 pint of vinegar, a little lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick out the tails of the prawns, put the bodies in a stewpan\r\nwith 1 blade of mace, 1/2 pint of vinegar, and the same quantity of\r\nwater; stew them for 1/4 hour, and strain off the liquor. Put the fish\r\nstock or water into a stewpan; add the strained liquor, pound the prawns\r\nwith the crumb of a roll moistened with a little of the soup, rub them\r\nthrough a tammy, and mix them by degrees with the soup; add ketchup or\r\nanchovy sauce to taste, with a little lemon-juice. When it is well\r\ncooked, put in a few picked prawns; let them get thoroughly hot, and\r\nserve. If not thick enough, put in a little butter and flour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 1d. per quart, if made with water.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time. _Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This can be thickened with tomatoes, and vermicelli served in\r\nit, which makes it a very tasteful soup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRAWN.]\r\n\r\n    THE PRAWN.--This little fish bears a striking resemblance to the\r\n    shrimp, but is neither so common nor so small. It is to be found\r\n    on most of the sandy shores of Europe. The Isle of Wight is\r\n    famous for shrimps, where they are potted; but both the prawns\r\n    and the shrimps vended in London, are too much salted for the\r\n    excellence of their natural flavour to be preserved. They are\r\n    extremely lively little animals, as seen in their native\r\n    retreats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL HISTORY OF FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\n199. IN NATURAL HISTORY, FISHES form the fourth class in the system of\r\nLinnaeus, and are described as having long under-jaws, eggs without\r\nwhite, organs of sense, fins for supporters, bodies covered with concave\r\nscales, gills to supply the place of lungs for respiration, and water\r\nfor the natural element of their existence. Had mankind no other\r\nknowledge of animals than of such as inhabit the land and breathe their\r\nown atmosphere, they would listen with incredulous wonder, if told that\r\nthere were other kinds of beings which existed only in the waters, and\r\nwhich would die almost as soon as they were taken from them. However\r\nstrongly these facts might be attested, they would hardly believe them,\r\nwithout the operation of their own senses, as they would recollect the\r\neffect produced on their own bodies when immersed in water, and the\r\nimpossibility of their sustaining life in it for any lengthened period\r\nof time. Experience, however, has taught them, that the \"great deep\" is\r\ncrowded with inhabitants of various sizes, and of vastly different\r\nconstructions, with modes of life entirely distinct from those which\r\nbelong to the animals of the land, and with peculiarities of design,\r\nequally wonderful with those of any other works which have come from the\r\nhand of the Creator. The history of these races, however, must remain\r\nfor ever, more or less, in a state of darkness, since the depths in\r\nwhich they live, are beyond the power of human exploration, and since\r\nthe illimitable expansion of their domain places them almost entirely\r\nout of the reach of human accessibility.\r\n\r\n200. IN STUDYING THE CONFORMATION OF FISHES, we naturally conclude that\r\nthey are, in every respect, well adapted to the element in which they\r\nhave their existence. Their shape has a striking resemblance to the\r\nlower part of a ship; and there is no doubt that the form of the fish\r\noriginally suggested the form of the ship. The body is in general\r\nslender, gradually diminishing towards each of its extremities, and\r\nflattened on each of its sides. This is precisely the form of the lower\r\npart of the hull of a ship; and it enables both the animal and the\r\nvessel, with comparative ease, to penetrate and divide the resisting\r\nmedium for which they have been adapted. The velocity of a ship,\r\nhowever, in sailing before the wind, is by no means to be compared to\r\nthat of a fish. It is well known that the largest fishes will, with the\r\ngreatest ease, overtake a ship in full sail, play round it without\r\neffort, and shoot ahead of it at pleasure. This arises from their great\r\nflexibility, which, to compete with mocks the labours of art, and\r\nenables them to migrate thousands of miles in a season, without the\r\nslightest indications of languor or fatigue.\r\n\r\n201. THE PRINCIPAL INSTRUMENTS EMPLOYED BY FISHES to accelerate their\r\nmotion, are their air-bladder, fins, and tail. By means of the\r\nair-bladder they enlarge or diminish the specific gravity of their\r\nbodies. When they wish to sink, they compress the muscles of the\r\nabdomen, and eject the air contained in it; by which, their weight,\r\ncompared with that of the water, is increased, and they consequently\r\ndescend. On the other hand, when they wish to rise, they relax the\r\ncompression of the abdominal muscles, when the air-bladder fills and\r\ndistends, and the body immediately ascends to the surface. How simply,\r\nyet how wonderfully, has the Supreme Being adapted certain means to the\r\nattainment of certain ends! Those fishes which are destitute of the\r\nair-bladder are heavy in the water, and have no great \"alacrity\" in\r\nrising. The larger proportion of them remain at the bottom, unless they\r\nare so formed as to be able to strike their native element downwards\r\nwith sufficient force to enable them to ascend. When the air-bladder of\r\na fish is burst, its power of ascending to the surface has for ever\r\npassed away. From a knowledge of this fact, the fishermen of cod are\r\nenabled to preserve them alive for a considerable time in their\r\nwell-boats. The means they adopt to accomplish this, is to perforate the\r\nsound, or air-bladder, with a needle, which disengages the air, when the\r\nfishes immediately descend to the bottom of the well, into which they\r\nare thrown. Without this operation, it would be impossible to keep the\r\ncod under water whilst they had life. In swimming, the _fins_ enable\r\nfishes to preserve their upright position, especially those of the\r\nbelly, which act like two feet. Without those, they would swim with\r\ntheir bellies upward, as it is in their backs that the centre of gravity\r\nlies. In ascending and descending, these are likewise of great\r\nassistance, as they contract and expand accordingly. The _tail_ is an\r\ninstrument of great muscular force, and largely assists the fish in all\r\nits motions. In some instances it acts like the rudder of a ship, and\r\nenables it to turn sideways; and when moved from side to side with a\r\nquick vibratory motion, fishes are made, in the same manner as the\r\n\"screw\" propeller makes a steamship, to dart forward with a celerity\r\nproportioned to the muscular force with which it is employed.\r\n\r\n202. THE BODIES OF FISHES are mostly covered with a kind of horny\r\nscales; but some are almost entirely without them, or have them so\r\nminute as to be almost invisible; as is the case with the eel. The\r\nobject of these is to preserve them from injury by the pressure of the\r\nwater, or the sudden contact with pebbles, rocks, or sea-weeds. Others,\r\nagain, are enveloped in a fatty, oleaginous substance, also intended as\r\na defence against the friction of the water; and those in which the\r\nscales are small, are supplied with a larger quantity of slimy matter.\r\n\r\n203. THE RESPIRATION OF FISHES is effected by means of those comb-like\r\norgans which are placed on each side of the neck, and which are called\r\ngills. It is curious to watch the process of breathing as it is\r\nperformed by the finny tribes. It seems to be so continuous, that it\r\nmight almost pass for an illustration of the vexed problem which\r\nconceals the secret of perpetual motion. In performing it, they fill\r\ntheir mouths with water, which they drive backwards with a force so\r\ngreat as to open the large flap, to allow it to escape behind. In this\r\noperation all, or a great portion, of the air contained in the water, is\r\nleft among the feather-like processes of the gills, and is carried into\r\nthe body, there to perform its part in the animal economy. In proof of\r\nthis, it has been ascertained that, if the water in which fishes are\r\nput, is, by any means, denuded of its air, they immediately seek the\r\nsurface, and begin to gasp for it. Hence, distilled water is to them\r\nwhat a vacuum made by an air-pump, is to most other animals. For this\r\nreason, when a fishpond, or other aqueous receptacle in which fishes are\r\nkept, is entirely frozen over, it is necessary to make holes in the ice,\r\nnot so especially for the purpose of feeding them, as for that of giving\r\nthem air to breathe.\r\n\r\n204. THE POSITIONS OF THE TEETH OF FISHES are well calculated to excite\r\nour amazement; for, in some cases, these are situated in the jaws,\r\nsometimes on the tongue or palate, and sometimes even in the throat.\r\nThey are in general sharp-pointed and immovable; but in the carp they\r\nare obtuse, and in the pike so easily moved as to seem to have no deeper\r\nhold than such as the mere skin can afford. In the herring, the tongue\r\nis set with teeth, to enable it the better, it is supposed, to retain\r\nits food.\r\n\r\n205. ALTHOUGH NATURALISTS HAVE DIVIDED FISHES into two great tribes, the\r\n_osseous_ and the _cartilaginous_, yet the distinction is not very\r\nprecise; for the first have a great deal of cartilage, and the second,\r\nat any rate, a portion of calcareous matter in their bones. It may,\r\ntherefore, be said that the bones of fishes form a kind of intermediate\r\nsubstance between true bones and cartilages. The backbone extends\r\nthrough the whole length of the body, and consists of vertebrae, strong\r\nand thick towards the head, but weaker and more slender as it approaches\r\nthe tail. Each species has a determinate number of vertebrae, which are\r\nincreased in size in proportion with the body. The ribs are attached to\r\nthe processes of the vertebrae, and inclose the breast and abdomen. Some\r\nkinds, as the rays, have no ribs; whilst others, as the sturgeon and\r\neel, have very short ones. Between the pointed processes of the\r\nvertebrae are situated the bones which support the dorsal (back) and the\r\nanal (below the tail) fins, which are connected with the processes by a\r\nligament. At the breast are the sternum or breastbone, clavicles or\r\ncollar-bones, and the scapulae or shoulder-blades, on which the\r\npectoral or breast fins are placed. The bones which support the ventral\r\nor belly fins are called the _ossa pelvis_. Besides these principal\r\nbones, there are often other smaller ones, placed between the muscles to\r\nassist their motion.\r\n\r\n206. SOME OF THE ORGANS OF SENSE IN FISHES are supposed to be possessed\r\nby them in a high degree, and others much more imperfectly. Of the\r\nlatter kind are the senses of touch and taste, which are believed to be\r\nvery slightly developed. On the other hand, those of hearing, seeing,\r\nand smelling, are ascertained to be acute, but the first in a lesser\r\ndegree than both the second and third. Their possession of an auditory\r\norgan was long doubted, and even denied by some physiologists; but it\r\nhas been found placed on the sides of the skull, or in the cavity which\r\ncontains the brain. It occupies a position entirely distinct and\r\ndetached from the skull, and, in this respect, differs in the local\r\ndisposition of the same sense in birds and quadrupeds. In some fishes,\r\nas in those of the ray kind, the organ is wholly encompassed by those\r\nparts which contain the cavity of the skull; whilst in the cod and\r\nsalmon kind it is in the part within the skull. Its structure is, in\r\nevery way, much more simple than that of the same sense in those animals\r\nwhich live entirely in the air; but there is no doubt that they have the\r\nadaptation suitable to their condition. In some genera, as in the rays,\r\nthe external orifice or ear is very small, and is placed in the upper\r\nsurface of the head; whilst in others there is no visible external\r\norifice whatever. However perfect the _sight_ of fishes may be,\r\nexperience has shown that this sense is of much less use to them than\r\nthat of smelling, in searching for their food. The optic nerves in\r\nfishes have this peculiarity,--that they are not confounded with one\r\nanother in their middle progress between their origin and their orbit.\r\nThe one passes over the other without any communication; so that the\r\nnerve which comes from the left side of the brain goes distinctly to the\r\nright eye, and that which comes from the right goes distinctly to the\r\nleft. In the greater part of them, the eye is covered with the same\r\ntransparent skin that covers the rest of the head. The object of this\r\narrangement, perhaps, is to defend it from the action of the water, as\r\nthere are no eyelids. The globe in front is somewhat depressed, and is\r\nfurnished behind with a muscle, which serves to lengthen or flatten it,\r\naccording to the necessities of the animal. The crystalline humour,\r\nwhich in quadrupeds is flattened, is, in fishes, nearly globular. The\r\norgan of _smelling_ in fishes is large, and is endued, at its entry,\r\nwith a dilating and contracting power, which is employed as the wants of\r\nthe animal may require. It is mostly by the acuteness of their smell\r\nthat fishes are enabled to discover their food; for their tongue is not\r\ndesigned for nice sensation, being of too firm a cartilaginous substance\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\n207. WITH RESPECT TO THE FOOD OF FISHES, this is almost universally\r\nfound in their own element. They are mostly carnivorous, though they\r\nseize upon almost anything that comes in their way: they even devour\r\ntheir own offspring, and manifest a particular predilection for all\r\nliving creatures. Those, to which Nature has meted out mouths of the\r\ngreatest capacity, would seem to pursue everything with life, and\r\nfrequently engage in fierce conflicts with their prey. The animal with\r\nthe largest mouth is usually the victor; and he has no sooner conquered\r\nhis foe than he devours him. Innumerable shoals of one species pursue\r\nthose of another, with a ferocity which draws them from the pole to the\r\nequator, through all the varying temperatures and depths of their\r\nboundless domain. In these pursuits a scene of universal violence is the\r\nresult; and many species must have become extinct, had not Nature\r\naccurately proportioned the means of escape, the production, and the\r\nnumbers, to the extent and variety of the danger to which they are\r\nexposed. Hence the smaller species are not only more numerous, but more\r\nproductive than the larger; whilst their instinct leads them in search\r\nof food and safety near the shores, where, from the shallowness of the\r\nwaters, many of their foes are unable to follow them.\r\n\r\n208. THE FECUNDITY OF FISHES has been the wonder of every natural\r\nphilosopher whose attention has been attracted to the subject. They are\r\nin general oviparous, or egg-producing; but there are a few, such as the\r\neel and the blenny, which are viviparous, or produce their young alive.\r\nThe males have the _milt_ and the females the _roe_; but some\r\nindividuals, as the sturgeon and the cod tribes, are said to contain\r\nboth. The greater number deposit their spawn in the sand or gravel; but\r\nsome of those which dwell in the depths of the ocean attach their eggs\r\nto sea-weeds. In every instance, however, their fruitfulness far\r\nsurpasses that of any other race of animals. According to Lewenhoeck,\r\nthe cod annually spawns upwards of nine millions of eggs, contained in a\r\nsingle roe. The flounder produces one million; the mackerel above five\r\nhundred thousand; a herring of a moderate size at least ten thousand; a\r\ncarp fourteen inches in length, according to Petit, contained two\r\nhundred and sixty-two thousand two hundred and twenty-four; a perch\r\ndeposited three hundred and eighty thousand six hundred and forty; and a\r\nfemale sturgeon seven millions six hundred and fifty-three thousand two\r\nhundred. The viviparous species are by no means so prolific; yet the\r\nblenny brings forth two or three hundred at a time, which commence\r\nsporting together round their parent the moment they have come into\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n209. IN REFERENCE TO THE LONGEVITY OF FISHES, it is affirmed to surpass\r\nthat of all other created beings; and it is supposed they are, to a\r\ngreat extent, exempted from the diseases to which the flesh of other\r\nanimals is heir. In place of suffering from the rigidity of age, which\r\nis the cause of the natural decay of those that \"live and move and have\r\ntheir being\" on the land, their bodies continue to grow with each\r\nsucceeding supply of food, and the conduits of life to perform their\r\nfunctions unimpaired. The age of fishes has not been properly\r\nascertained, although it is believed that the most minute of the species\r\nhas a longer lease of life than man. The mode in which they die has been\r\nnoted by the Rev. Mr. White, the eminent naturalist of Selbourne. As\r\nsoon as the fish sickens, the head sinks lower and lower, till the\r\nanimal, as it were, stands upon it. After this, as it becomes weaker, it\r\nloses its poise, till the tail turns over, when it comes to the surface,\r\nand floats with its belly upwards. The reason for its floating in this\r\nmanner is on account of the body being no longer balanced by the fins of\r\nthe belly, and the broad muscular back preponderating, by its own\r\ngravity, over the belly, from this latter being a cavity, and\r\nconsequently lighter.\r\n\r\n210. FISHES ARE EITHER SOLITARY OR GREGARIOUS, and some of them migrate\r\nto great distances, and into certain rivers, to deposit their spawn. Of\r\nsea-fishes, the cod, herring, mackerel, and many others, assemble in\r\nimmense shoals, and migrate through different tracts of the ocean; but,\r\nwhether considered in their solitary or gregarious capacity, they are\r\nalike wonderful to all who look through Nature up to Nature's God, and\r\nconsider, with due humility, yet exalted admiration, the sublime\r\nvariety, beauty, power, and grandeur of His productions, as manifested\r\nin the Creation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH AS AN ARTICLE OF HUMAN FOOD.\r\n\r\n211. AS THE NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES OF FISH are deemed inferior to those of\r\nwhat is called butchers' meat, it would appear, from all we can learn,\r\nthat, in all ages, it has held only a secondary place in the estimation\r\nof those who have considered the science of gastronomy as a large\r\nelement in the happiness of mankind. Among the Jews of old it was very\r\nlittle used, although it seems not to have been entirely interdicted, as\r\nMoses prohibited only the use of such as had neither scales nor fins.\r\nThe Egyptians, however, made fish an article of diet, notwithstanding\r\nthat it was rejected by their priests. Egypt, however, is not a country\r\nfavourable to the production of fish, although we read of the people,\r\nwhen hungry, eating it raw; of epicures among them having dried it in\r\nthe sun; and of its being salted and preserved, to serve as a repast on\r\ndays of great solemnity.\r\n\r\n    The modern Egyptians are, in general, extremely temperate in\r\n    regard to food. Even the richest among them take little pride,\r\n    and, perhaps, experience as little delight, in the luxuries of\r\n    the table. Their dishes mostly consist of pilaus, soups, and\r\n    stews, prepared principally of onions, cucumbers, and other cold\r\n    vegetables, mixed with a little meat cut into small pieces. On\r\n    special occasions, however, a whole sheep is placed on the\r\n    festive board; but during several of the hottest months of the\r\n    year, the richest restrict themselves entirely to a vegetable\r\n    diet. The poor are contented with a little oil or sour milk, in\r\n    which they may dip their bread.\r\n\r\n212. PASSING FROM AFRICA TO EUROPE, we come amongst a people who have,\r\nalmost from time immemorial, occupied a high place in the estimation of\r\nevery civilized country; yet the Greeks, in their earlier ages, made\r\nvery little use of fish as an article of diet. In the eyes of the heroes\r\nof Homer it had little favour; for Menelaus complained that \"hunger\r\npressed their digestive organs,\" and they had been obliged to live upon\r\nfish. Subsequently, however, fish became one of the principal articles\r\nof diet amongst the Hellenes; and both Aristophanes and Athenaeus allude\r\nto it, and even satirize their countrymen for their excessive partiality\r\nto the turbot and mullet.\r\n\r\n    So infatuated were many of the Greek gastronomes with the love\r\n    of fish, that some of them would have preferred death from\r\n    indigestion to the relinquishment of the precious dainties with\r\n    which a few of the species supplied them. Philoxenes of Cythera\r\n    was one of these. On being informed by his physician that he was\r\n    going to die of indigestion, on account of the quantity he was\r\n    consuming of a delicious fish, \"Be it so,\" he calmly observed;\r\n    \"but before I die, let me finish the remainder.\"\r\n\r\n213. THE GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION OF GREECE was highly favourable for the\r\ndevelopment of a taste for the piscatory tribes; and the skill of the\r\nGreek cooks was so great, that they could impart every variety of relish\r\nto the dish they were called upon to prepare. Athenaeus has transmitted\r\nto posterity some very important precepts upon their ingenuity in\r\nseasoning with salt, oil, and aromatics.\r\n\r\n    At the present day the food of the Greeks, through the combined\r\n    influence of poverty and the long fasts which their religion\r\n    imposes upon them, is, to a large extent, composed of fish,\r\n    accompanied with vegetables and fruit. Caviare, prepared from\r\n    the roes of sturgeons, is the national ragout, which, like all\r\n    other fish dishes, they season with aromatic herbs. Snails\r\n    dressed in garlic are also a favourite dish.\r\n\r\n214. AS THE ROMANS, in a great measure, took their taste in the fine\r\narts from the Greeks, so did they, in some measure, their piscine\r\nappetites. The eel-pout and the lotas's liver were the favourite fish\r\ndishes of the Roman epicures; whilst the red mullet was esteemed as one\r\nof the most delicate fishes that could be brought to the table.\r\n\r\n    With all the elegance, taste, and refinement of Roman luxury, it\r\n    was sometimes promoted or accompanied by acts of great\r\n    barbarity. In proof of this, the mention of the red mullet\r\n    suggests the mode in which it was sometimes treated for the, to\r\n    us, _horrible_ entertainment of the _fashionable_ in Roman\r\n    circles. It may be premised, that as England has, Rome, in her\r\n    palmy days, had, her fops, who had, no doubt, through the medium\r\n    of their cooks, discovered that when the scales of the red\r\n    mullet were removed, the flesh presented a fine pink-colour.\r\n    Having discovered this, it was further observed that at the\r\n    death of the animal, this colour passed through a succession of\r\n    beautiful shades, and, in order that these might be witnessed\r\n    and enjoyed in their fullest perfection, the poor mullet was\r\n    served alive in a glass vessel.\r\n\r\n215. THE LOVE OF FISH among the ancient Romans rose to a real mania.\r\nApicius offered a prize to any one who could invent a new brine\r\ncompounded of the liver of red mullets; and Lucullus had a canal cut\r\nthrough a mountain, in the neighbourhood of Naples, that fish might be\r\nthe more easily transported to the gardens of his villa. Hortensius, the\r\norator, wept over the death of a turbot which he had fed with his own\r\nhands; and the daughter of Druses adorned one that she had, with rings\r\nof gold. These were, surely, instances of misplaced affection; but there\r\nis no accounting for tastes. It was but the other day that we read in\r\nthe \"_Times_\" of a wealthy _living_ English hermit, who delights in the\r\ncompanionship of rats!\r\n\r\n    The modern Romans are merged in the general name of Italians,\r\n    who, with the exception of macaroni, have no specially\r\n    characteristic article of food.\r\n\r\n216. FROM ROME TO GAUL is, considering the means of modern locomotion,\r\nno great way; but the ancient sumptuary laws of that kingdom give us\r\nlittle information regarding the ichthyophagous propensities of its\r\ninhabitants. Louis XII. engaged six fishmongers to furnish his board\r\nwith fresh-water animals, and Francis I. had twenty-two, whilst Henry\r\nthe Great extended his requirements a little further, and had\r\ntwenty-four. In the time of Louis XIV. the cooks had attained to such a\r\ndegree of perfection in their art, that they could convert the form and\r\nflesh of the trout, pike, or carp, into the very shape and flavour of\r\nthe most delicious game.\r\n\r\n    The French long enjoyed a European reputation for their skill\r\n    and refinement in the preparing of food. In place of plain\r\n    joints, French cookery delights in the marvels of what are\r\n    called made dishes, ragouts, stews, and fricassees, in which no\r\n    trace of the original materials of which they are compounded is\r\n    to be found.\r\n\r\n217. FROM GAUL WE CROSS TO BRITAIN, where it has been asserted, by, at\r\nleast, one authority, that the ancient inhabitants ate no fish. However\r\nthis may be, we know that the British shores, particularly those of the\r\nNorth Sea, have always been well supplied with the best kinds of fish,\r\nwhich we may reasonably infer was not unknown to the inhabitants, or\r\nlikely to be lost upon them for the lack of knowledge as to how they\r\ntasted. By the time of Edward II., fish had, in England, become a\r\ndainty, especially the sturgeon, which was permitted to appear on no\r\ntable but that of the king. In the fourteenth century, a decree of King\r\nJohn informs us that the people ate both seals and porpoises; whilst in\r\nthe days of the Troubadours, whales were fished for and caught in the\r\nMediterranean Sea, for the purpose of being used as human food.\r\n\r\n    Whatever checks the ancient British may have had upon their\r\n    piscatory appetites, there are happily none of any great\r\n    consequence upon the modern, who delight in wholesome food of\r\n    every kind. Their taste is, perhaps, too much inclined to that\r\n    which is accounted solid and substantial; but they really eat\r\n    more moderately, even of animal food, than either the French or\r\n    the Germans. Roast beef, or other viands cooked in the plainest\r\n    manner, are, with them, a sufficient luxury; yet they delight in\r\n    living _well_, whilst it is easy to prove how largely their\r\n    affections are developed by even the prospect of a substantial\r\n    cheer. In proof of this we will just observe, that if a great\r\n    dinner is to be celebrated, it is not uncommon for the appointed\r\n    stewards and committee to meet and have a preliminary dinner\r\n    among themselves, in order to arrange the great one, and after\r\n    that, to have another dinner to discharge the bill which the\r\n    great one cost. This enjoyable disposition we take to form a\r\n    very large item in the aggregate happiness of the nation.\r\n\r\n218. THE GENERAL USE OF FISH, as an article of human food among\r\ncivilized nations, we have thus sufficiently shown, and will conclude\r\nthis portion of our subject with the following hints, which ought to be\r\nremembered by all those who are fond of occasionally varying their\r\ndietary with a piscine dish:--\r\n\r\nI. Fish shortly before they spawn are, in general, best in condition.\r\nWhen the spawning is just over, they are out of season, and unfit for\r\nhuman food.\r\n\r\nII. When fish is out of season, it has a transparent, bluish tinge,\r\nhowever much it may be boiled; when it is in season, its muscles are\r\nfirm, and boil white and curdy.\r\n\r\nIII. As food for invalids, white fish, such as the ling, cod, haddock,\r\ncoal-fish, and whiting, are the best; flat fish, as soles, skate,\r\nturbot, and flounders, are also good.\r\n\r\nIV. Salmon, mackerel, herrings, and trout soon spoil or decompose after\r\nthey are killed; therefore, to be in perfection, they should be prepared\r\nfor the table on the day they are caught. With flat fish, this is not of\r\nsuch consequence, as they will keep longer. The turbot, for example, is\r\nimproved by being kept a day or two.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR DRESSING FISH.\r\n\r\n219. IN DRESSING FISH, of any kind, the first point to be attended to,\r\nis to see that it be perfectly clean. It is a common error to wash it\r\ntoo much; as by doing so the flavour is diminished. If the fish is to be\r\nboiled, a little salt and vinegar should be put into the water, to give\r\nit firmness, after it is cleaned. Cod-fish, whiting, and haddock, are\r\nfar better if a little salted, and kept a day; and if the weather be not\r\nvery hot, they will be good for two days.\r\n\r\n220. WHEN FISH IS CHEAP AND PLENTIFUL, and a larger quantity is\r\npurchased than is immediately wanted, the overplus of such as will bear\r\nit should be potted, or pickled, or salted, and hung up; or it may be\r\nfried, that it may serve for stewing the next day. Fresh-water fish,\r\nhaving frequently a muddy smell and taste, should be soaked in strong\r\nsalt and water, after it has been well cleaned. If of a sufficient size,\r\nit may be scalded in salt and water, and afterwards dried and dressed.\r\n\r\n221. FISH SHOULD BE PUT INTO COLD WATER, and set on the fire to do very\r\ngently, or the outside will break before the inner part is done. Unless\r\nthe fishes are small, they should never be put into warm water; nor\r\nshould water, either hot or cold, be poured _on_ to the fish, as it is\r\nliable to break the skin: if it should be necessary to add a little\r\nwater whilst the fish is cooking, it ought to be poured in gently at the\r\nside of the vessel. The fish-plate may be drawn up, to see if the fish\r\nbe ready, which may be known by its easily separating from the bone. It\r\nshould then be immediately taken out of the water, or it will become\r\nwoolly. The fish-plate should be set crossways over the kettle, to keep\r\nhot for serving, and a clean cloth over the fish, to prevent its losing\r\nits colour.\r\n\r\n222. IN GARNISHING FISH, great attention is required, and plenty of\r\nparsley, horseradish, and lemon should be used. If fried parsley be\r\nused, it must be washed and picked, and thrown into fresh water. When\r\nthe lard or dripping boils, throw the parsley into it immediately from\r\nthe water, and instantly it will be green and crisp, and must be taken\r\nup with a slice. When well done, and with very good sauce, fish is more\r\nappreciated than almost any other dish. The liver and roe, in some\r\ninstances, should be placed on the dish, in order that they may be\r\ndistributed in the course of serving; but to each recipe will be\r\nappended the proper mode of serving and garnishing.\r\n\r\n223. IF FISH IS TO BE FRIED OR BROILED, it must be dried in a nice soft\r\ncloth, after it is well cleaned and washed. If for frying, brush it over\r\nwith egg, and sprinkle it with some fine crumbs of bread. If done a\r\nsecond time with the egg and bread, the fish will look so much the\r\nbetter. If required to be very nice, a sheet of white blotting-paper\r\nmust be placed to receive it, that it may be free from all grease. It\r\nmust also be of a beautiful colour, and all the crumbs appear distinct.\r\nButter gives a bad colour; lard and clarified dripping are most\r\nfrequently used; but oil is the best, if the expense be no objection.\r\nThe fish should be put into the lard when boiling, and there should be a\r\nsufficiency of this to cover it.\r\n\r\n224. WHEN FISH IS BROILED, it must be seasoned, floured, and laid on a\r\nvery clean gridiron, which, when hot, should be rubbed with a bit of\r\nsuet, to prevent the fish from sticking. It must be broiled over a very\r\nclear fire, that it may not taste smoky; and not too near, that it may\r\nnot be scorched.\r\n\r\n225. IN CHOOSING FISH, it is well to remember that it is possible it may\r\nbe _fresh_, and yet not _good_. Under the head of each particular fish\r\nin this work, are appended rules for its choice and the months when it\r\nis in season. Nothing can be of greater consequence to a cook than to\r\nhave the fish good; as if this important course in a dinner does not\r\ngive satisfaction, it is rarely that the repast goes off well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH.\r\n\r\n[_Nothing is more difficult than to give the average prices of Fish,\r\ninasmuch as a few hours of bad weather at sea will, in the space of one\r\nday, cause such a difference in its supply, that the same fish--a turbot\r\nfor instance--which may be bought to-day for six or seven shillings,\r\nwill, to-morrow, be, in the London markets, worth, perhaps, almost as\r\nmany pounds. The average costs, therefore, which will be found appended\r\nto each recipe, must be understood as about the average price for the\r\ndifferent kinds of fish, when the market is supplied upon an average,\r\nand when the various sorts are of an average size and quality._\r\n\r\nGENERAL RULE IN CHOOSING FISH.--_A proof of freshness and goodness in\r\nmost fishes, is their being covered with scales; for, if deficient in\r\nthis respect, it is a sign of their being stale, or having been\r\nill-used._]\r\n\r\nFRIED ANCHOVIES.\r\n\r\n226. INGREDIENTS.--1 tablespoonful of oil, 1/2 a glass of white wine,\r\nsufficient flour to thicken; 12 anchovies.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the oil and wine together, with sufficient flour to make\r\nthem into a thickish paste; cleanse the anchovies, wipe them, dip them\r\nin the paste, and fry of a nice brown colour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_ for this quantity, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANCHOVY.]\r\n\r\n    THE ANCHOVY.--In his book of \"British Fishes,\" Mr. Yarrell\r\n    states that \"the anchovy is a common fish in the Mediterranean,\r\n    from Greece to Gibraltar, and was well known to the Greeks and\r\n    Romans, by whom the liquor prepared from it, called _garum_, was\r\n    in great estimation. Its extreme range is extended into the\r\n    Black Sea. The fishing for them is carried on during the night,\r\n    and lights are used with the nets. The anchovy is common on the\r\n    coasts of Portugal, Spain, and France. It occurs, I have no\r\n    doubt, at the Channel Islands, and has been taken on the\r\n    Hampshire coast, and in the Bristol Channel.\" Other fish, of\r\n    inferior quality, but resembling the real Gorgona anchovy, are\r\n    frequently sold for it, and passed off as genuine.\r\n\r\nANCHOVY BUTTER OR PASTE.\r\n\r\n227. INGREDIENTS.--2 dozen anchovies, 1/2 lb. of fresh butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the anchovies thoroughly; bone and dry them, and pound\r\nthem in a mortar to a paste. Mix the butter gradually with them, and rub\r\nthe whole through a sieve. Put it by in small pots for use, and\r\ncarefully exclude the air with a bladder, as it soon changes the colour\r\nof anchovies, besides spoiling them.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 2s.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTTED ANCHOVIES.\r\n\r\nPOTTED ANCHOVIES are made in the same way, by adding pounded mace,\r\ncayenne, and nutmeg to taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nANCHOVY TOAST.\r\n\r\n228. INGREDIENTS.--Toast 2 or 3 slices of bread, or, if wanted very\r\nsavoury, fry them in clarified butter, and spread on them the paste, No.\r\n227. Made mustard, or a few grains of cayenne, may be added to the paste\r\nbefore laying it on the toast.\r\n\r\n    ANCHOVY PASTE.--\"When some delicate zest,\" says a work just\r\n    issued on the adulterations of trade, \"is required to make the\r\n    plain English breakfast more palatable, many people are in the\r\n    habit of indulging in what they imagine to be anchovies. These\r\n    fish are preserved in a kind of pickling-bottle, carefully\r\n    corked down, and surrounded by a red-looking liquor, resembling\r\n    in appearance diluted clay. The price is moderate, one shilling\r\n    only being demanded for the luxury. When these anchovies are\r\n    what is termed potted, it implies that the fish have been\r\n    pounded into the consistency of a paste, and then placed in flat\r\n    pots, somewhat similar in shape to those used for pomatum. This\r\n    paste is usually eaten spread upon toast, and is said to form an\r\n    excellent _bonne bouche_, which enables gentlemen at\r\n    wine-parties to enjoy their port with redoubled gusto.\r\n    Unfortunately, in six cases out of ten, the only portion of\r\n    these preserved delicacies, that contains anything indicative of\r\n    anchovies, is the paper label pasted on the bottle or pot, on\r\n    which the word itself is printed.... All the samples of anchovy\r\n    paste, analyzed by different medical men, have been found to be\r\n    highly and vividly coloured with very large quantities of bole\r\n    Armenian.\" The anchovy itself, when imported, is of a dark dead\r\n    colour, and it is to make it a bright \"handsome-looking sauce\"\r\n    that this red earth is used.\r\n\r\nBARBEL.\r\n\r\n229. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of port wine, a saltspoonful of salt, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of vinegar, 2 sliced onions, a faggot of sweet herbs,\r\nnutmeg and mace to taste, the juice of a lemon, 2 anchovies; 1 or 2\r\nbarbels, according to size.\r\n\r\n_Mode_--Boil the barbels in salt and water till done; pour off some of\r\nthe water, and, to the remainder, put the ingredients mentioned above.\r\nSimmer gently for 1/2 hour, or rather more, and strain. Put in the fish;\r\nheat it gradually; but do not let it boil, or it will be broken.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1 hour. _Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to November.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BARBEL.]\r\n\r\n    THE BARBEL,--This fish takes its name from the barbs or wattels\r\n    at its mouth; and, in England, is esteemed as one of the worst\r\n    of the fresh-water fish. It was, however, formerly, if not now,\r\n    a favourite with the Jews, excellent cookers of fish. Others\r\n    would boil with it a piece of bacon, that it might have a\r\n    relish. It is to be met with from two to three or four feet\r\n    long, and is said to live to a great age. From Putney upwards,\r\n    in the Thames, some are found of large size; but they are valued\r\n    only as affording sport to the brethren of the angle.\r\n\r\nBRILL.\r\n\r\n230. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of salt to each gallon of water; a little\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clean the brill, cut off the fins, and rub it over with a\r\nlittle lemon-juice, to preserve its whiteness. Set the fish in\r\nsufficient cold water to cover it; throw in salt, in the above\r\nproportions, and a little vinegar, and bring it gradually to boil;\r\nsimmer very gently till the fish is done, which will be in about 10\r\nminutes; but the time for boiling, of course, depends entirely on the\r\nsize of the fish. Serve it on a hot napkin, and garnish with cut lemon,\r\nparsley, horseradish, and a little lobster coral sprinkled over the\r\nfish. Send lobster or shrimp sauce and plain melted butter to table with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--After the water boils, a small brill, 10 minutes; a large\r\nbrill, 15 to 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 4s. to 8s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to April.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRILL.]\r\n\r\n    THE BRILL.--This fish resembles the sole, but is broader, and\r\n    when large, is esteemed by many in a scarcely less degree than\r\n    the turbot, whilst it is much cheaper. It is a fine fish, and is\r\n    abundant in the London market.\r\n\r\nTO CHOOSE BRILL.--The flesh of this fish, like that of turbot, should be\r\nof a yellowish tint, and should be chosen on account of its thickness.\r\nIf the flesh has a bluish tint, it is not good.\r\n\r\n\r\nCODFISH.\r\n\r\n231. Cod may be boiled whole; but a large head and shoulders are quite\r\nsufficient for a dish, and contain all that is usually helped, because,\r\nwhen the thick part is done, the tail is insipid and overdone. The\r\nlatter, cut in slices, makes a very good dish for frying; or it may be\r\nsalted down and served with egg sauce and parsnips. Cod, when boiled\r\nquite fresh, is watery; salting a little, renders it firmer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COD.]\r\n\r\n    THE COD TRIBE.--The Jugular, characterized by bony gills, and\r\n    ventral fins before the pectoral ones, commences the second of\r\n    the Linnaean orders of fishes, and is a numerous tribe,\r\n    inhabiting only the depths of the ocean, and seldom visiting the\r\n    fresh waters. They have a smooth head, and the gill membrane has\r\n    seven rays. The body is oblong, and covered with deciduous\r\n    scales. The fins are all inclosed in skin, whilst their rays are\r\n    unarmed. The ventral fins are slender, and terminate in a point.\r\n    Their habits are gregarious, and they feed on smaller fish and\r\n    other marine animals.\r\n\r\nCOD'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS.\r\n\r\n232. INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient water to cover the fish; 5 oz. of salt to\r\neach gallon of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cleanse the fish thoroughly, and rub a little salt over the\r\nthick part and inside of the fish, 1 or 2 hours before dressing it, as\r\nthis very much improves the flavour. Lay it in the fish-kettle, with\r\nsufficient cold water to cover it. Be very particular not to pour the\r\nwater on the fish, as it is liable to break it, and only keep it just\r\nsimmering. If the water should boil away, add a little by pouring it in\r\nat the side of the kettle, and not on the fish. Add salt in the above\r\nproportion, and bring it gradually to a boil. Skim very carefully, draw\r\nit to the side of the fire, and let it gently simmer till done. Take it\r\nout and drain it; serve on a hot napkin, and garnish with cut lemon,\r\nhorseradish, the roe and liver. (_See_ Coloured Plate C.)\r\n\r\n_Time_.--According to size, 1/2 an hour, more or less. _Average cost_,\r\nfrom 3s. to 6s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Oyster sauce and plain melted butter should be served with\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nTO CHOOSE COD.--The cod should be chosen for the table when it is plump\r\nand round near the tail, when the hollow behind the head is deep, and\r\nwhen the sides are undulated as if they were ribbed. The glutinous parts\r\nabout the head lose their delicate flavour, after the fish has been\r\ntwenty-four hours out of the water. The great point by which the cod\r\nshould be judged is the firmness of its flesh; and, although the cod is\r\nnot firm when it is alive, its quality may be arrived at by pressing the\r\nfinger into the flesh. If this rises immediately, the fish is good; if\r\nnot, it is stale. Another sign of its goodness is, if the fish, when it\r\nis cut, exhibits a bronze appearance, like the silver side of a round of\r\nbeef. When this is the case, the flesh will be firm when cooked.\r\nStiffness in a cod, or in any other fish, is a sure sign of freshness,\r\nthough not always of quality. Sometimes, codfish, though exhibiting\r\nsigns of rough usage, will eat much better than those with red gills, so\r\nstrongly recommended by many cookery-books. This appearance is generally\r\ncaused by the fish having been knocked about at sea, in the well-boats,\r\nin which they are conveyed from the fishing-grounds to market.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALT COD, COMMONLY CALLED \"SALT-FISH.\"\r\n\r\n233. INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient water to cover the fish.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the fish, and lay it all night in water, with a 1/4 pint\r\nof vinegar. When thoroughly soaked, take it out, see that it is\r\nperfectly clean, and put it in the fish-kettle with sufficient cold\r\nwater to cover it. Heat it gradually, but do not let it boil much, or\r\nthe fish will be hard. Skim well, and when done, drain the fish and put\r\nit on a napkin garnished with hard-boiled eggs cut in rings.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1 hour. _Average cost_, 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in the spring.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for each person, 1/4 lb.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Serve with egg sauce and parsnips. This is an especial dish on\r\nAsh Wednesday.\r\n\r\n    PRESERVING COD.--Immediately as the cod are caught, their heads\r\n    are cut off. They are then opened, cleaned, and salted, when\r\n    they are stowed away in the hold of the vessel, in beds of five\r\n    or six yards square, head to tail, with a layer of salt to each\r\n    layer of fish. When they have lain in this state three or four\r\n    days, in order that the water may drain from them, they are\r\n    shifted into a different part of the vessel, and again salted.\r\n    Here they remain till the vessel is loaded, when they are\r\n    sometimes cut into thick pieces and packed in barrels for the\r\n    greater convenience of carriage.\r\n\r\nCOD SOUNDS.\r\n\r\nShould be well soaked in salt and water, and thoroughly washed before\r\ndressing them. They are considered a great delicacy, and may either be\r\nbroiled, fried, or boiled: if they are boiled, mix a little milk with\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOD SOUNDS, EN POULE.\r\n\r\n234. INGREDIENTS.--For forcemeat, 12 chopped oysters, 3 chopped\r\nanchovies, 1/4 lb. of bread crumbs, 1 oz. of butter, 2 eggs; seasoning\r\nof salt, pepper, nutmeg, and mace to taste; 4 cod sounds.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the forcemeat by mixing the ingredients well together.\r\nWash the sounds, and boil them in milk and water for 1/2 an hour; take\r\nthem out and let them cool. Cover each with a layer of forcemeat, roll\r\nthem up in a nice form, and skewer them. Rub over with lard, dredge with\r\nflour, and cook them gently before the fire in a Dutch oven.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March. _Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n    THE SOUNDS IN CODFISH.--These are the air or swimming bladders,\r\n    by means of which the fishes are enabled to ascend or descend in\r\n    the water. In the Newfoundland fishery they are taken out\r\n    previous to incipient putrefaction, washed from their slime and\r\n    salted for exportation. The tongues are also cured and packed up\r\n    in barrels; whilst, from the livers, considerable quantities of\r\n    oil are extracted, this oil having been found possessed of the\r\n    most nourishing properties, and particularly beneficial in cases\r\n    of pulmonary affections.\r\n\r\nCOD PIE.\r\n\r\n(_Economical_.)\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n235. INGREDIENTS.--Any remains of cold cod, 12 oysters, sufficient\r\nmelted butter to moisten it; mashed potatoes enough to fill up the dish.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Flake the fish from the bone, and carefully take away all the\r\nskin. Lay it in a pie-dish, pour over the melted butter and oysters (or\r\noyster sauce, if there is any left), and cover with mashed potatoes.\r\nBake for 1/2 an hour, and send to table of a nice brown colour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n236. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of cod; pepper and salt to taste; 1/2 a\r\nteaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1 large blade of pounded mace, 2 oz. of\r\nbutter, 1/2 pint of stock No. 107, a paste crust (_see_ Pastry). For\r\nsauce, 1 tablespoonful of stock, 1/4 pint of cream or milk, thickening\r\nof flour or butter; lemon-peel chopped very fine to taste; 12 oysters.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Lay the cod in salt for 4 hours, then wash it and place it in a\r\ndish; season, and add the butter and stock; cover with the crust, and\r\nbake for 1 hour, or rather more. Now make the sauce, by mixing the\r\ningredients named above; give it one boil, and pour it into the pie by a\r\nhole made at the top of the crust, which can easily be covered by a\r\nsmall piece of pastry cut and baked in any fanciful shape--such as a\r\nleaf, or otherwise.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, with fresh fish, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The remains of cold fish may be used for this pie.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRIED COD.\r\n\r\n237. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of large cod, or the remains of any cold\r\nfish; 3 oz. of butter, 1 onion sliced, a teacupful of white stock,\r\nthickening of butter and flour, 1 small teaspoonful of curry-powder,\r\n1/4 pint of cream, salt and cayenne to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Flake the fish, and fry it of a nice brown colour with the\r\nbutter and onions; put this in a stewpan, add the stock and thickening,\r\nand simmer for 10 minutes. Stir the curry-powder into the cream; put it,\r\nwith the seasoning, to the other ingredients; give one boil, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_, with fresh fish, 3s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n    THE FOOD OF THE COD.--This chiefly consists of the smaller\r\n    species of the scaly tribes, shell-fish, crabs, and worms. Their\r\n    voracity is very great, and they will bite at any small body\r\n    they see moved by the water, even stones and pebbles, which are\r\n    frequently found in their stomachs. They sometimes attain a\r\n    great size, but their usual weight is from 14 to 40 lbs.\r\n\r\nCOD A LA CREME.\r\n\r\n238. INGREDIENTS.--1 large slice of cod, 1 oz. of butter, 1 chopped\r\nshalot, a little minced parsley, 1/4 teacupful of white stock, 1/4 pint\r\nof milk or cream, flour to thicken, cayenne and lemon-juice to taste,\r\n1/4 teaspoonful of powdered sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the cod, and while hot, break it into flakes; put the\r\nbutter, shalot, parsley, and stock into a stewpan, and let them boil for\r\n5 minutes. Stir in sufficient flour to thicken, and pour to it the milk\r\nor cream. Simmer for 10 minutes, add the cayenne and sugar, and, when\r\nliked, a little lemon-juice. Put the fish in the sauce to warm\r\ngradually, but do not let it boil. Serve in a dish garnished with\r\ncroûtons.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, with cream, 2s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The remains of fish from the preceding day answer very well for\r\nthis dish.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOD A LA BECHAMEL.\r\n\r\n239. INGREDIENTS.--Any remains of cold cod, 4 tablespoonfuls of béchamel\r\n(_see_ Sauces), 2 oz. butter; seasoning to taste of pepper and salt;\r\nfried bread, a few bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Flake the cod carefully, leaving out all skin and bone; put the\r\nbéchamel in a stewpan with the butter, and stir it over the fire till\r\nthe latter is melted; add seasoning, put in the fish, and mix it well\r\nwith the sauce. Make a border of fried bread round the dish, lay in the\r\nfish, sprinkle over with bread crumbs, and baste with butter. Brown\r\neither before the fire or with a salamander, and garnish with toasted\r\nbread cut in fanciful shapes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the fish, 6d.\r\n\r\n    THE HABITAT OF THE COD.--This fish is found only in the seas of\r\n    the northern parts of the world, between the latitudes of 45°\r\n    and 66°. Its great rendezvous are the sandbanks of Newfoundland,\r\n    Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, and New England. These places are its\r\n    favourite resorts; for there it is able to obtain great\r\n    quantities of worms, a food peculiarly grateful to it. Another\r\n    cause of its attachment to these places has been said to be on\r\n    account of the vicinity to the Polar seas, where it returns to\r\n    spawn. Few are taken north of Iceland, and the shoals never\r\n    reach so far south as the Straits of Gibraltar. Many are taken\r\n    on the coasts of Norway, in the Baltic, and off the Orkneys,\r\n    which, prior to the discovery of Newfoundland, formed one of the\r\n    principal fisheries. The London market is supplied by those\r\n    taken between the Dogger Bank, the Well Bank, and Cromer, on the\r\n    east coast of England.\r\n\r\nCOD A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL.\r\n\r\n240. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of cod, 1/4 lb. of butter, a little chopped\r\nshalot and parsley; pepper to taste, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg,\r\nor rather less, when the flavour is not liked; the juice of 1/4 lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the cod, and either leave it whole, or, what is still\r\nbetter, flake it from the bone, and take off the skin. Put it into a\r\nstewpan with the butter, parsley, shalot, pepper, and nutmeg. Melt the\r\nbutter gradually, and be very careful that it does not become like oil.\r\nWhen all is well mixed and thoroughly hot, add the lemon-juice, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 2s. 6d.; with remains of cold fish,\r\n5d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Cod that has been left will do for this.\r\n\r\n    THE SEASON FOR FISHING COD.--The best season for catching cod is\r\n    from the beginning of February to the end of April; and although\r\n    each fisherman engaged in taking them, catches no more than one\r\n    at a time, an expert hand will sometimes take four hundred in a\r\n    day. The employment is excessively fatiguing, from the weight of\r\n    the fish as well as from the coldness of the climate.\r\n\r\nCOD A L'ITALIENNE.\r\n\r\n241. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of crimped cod, 1 shalot, 1 slice of ham\r\nminced very fine, 1/2 pint of white stock, No. 107; when liked, 1/2\r\nteacupful of cream; salt to taste; a few drops of garlic vinegar, a\r\nlittle lemon-juice, 1/2 teaspoonful of powdered sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the shalots, mince the ham very fine, pour on the stock,\r\nand simmer for 15 minutes. If the colour should not be good, add cream\r\nin the above proportion, and strain it through a fine sieve; season it,\r\nand put in the vinegar, lemon-juice, and sugar. Now boil the cod, take\r\nout the middle bone, and skin it; put it on the dish without breaking,\r\nand pour the sauce over it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 3s. 6d., with fresh fish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n    THE FECUNDITY OF THE COD.--In our preceding remarks on the\r\n    natural history of fishes, we have spoken of the amazing\r\n    fruitfulness of this fish; but in this we see one more instance\r\n    of the wise provision which Nature has made for supplying the\r\n    wants of man. So extensive has been the consumption of this\r\n    fish, that it is surprising that it has not long ago become\r\n    extinct; which would certainly have been the case, had it not\r\n    been for its wonderful powers of reproduction. \"So early as\r\n    1368,\" says Dr. Cloquet, \"the inhabitants of Amsterdam had\r\n    dispatched fishermen to the coast of Sweden; and in the first\r\n    quarter of 1792, from the ports of France only, 210 vessels went\r\n    out to the cod-fisheries. Every year, however, upwards of 10,000\r\n    vessels, of all nations, are employed in this trade, and bring\r\n    into the commercial world more than 40,000,000 of salted and\r\n    dried cod. If we add to this immense number, the havoc made\r\n    among the legions of cod by the larger scaly tribes of the great\r\n    deep, and take into account the destruction to which the young\r\n    are exposed by sea-fowls and other inhabitants of the seas,\r\n    besides the myriads of their eggs destroyed by accident, it\r\n    becomes a miracle to find that such mighty multitudes of them\r\n    are still in existence, and ready to continue the exhaustless\r\n    supply. Yet it ceases to excite our wonder when we remember that\r\n    the female can every year give birth to more than 9,000,000 at a\r\n    time.\"\r\n\r\nBAKED CARP.\r\n\r\n242. INGREDIENTS--1 carp, forcemeat, bread crumbs, 1 oz. butter, 1/2\r\npint of stock No. 105, 1/2 pint of port wine, 6 anchovies, 2 onions\r\nsliced, 1 bay-leaf, a faggot of sweet herbs, flour to thicken, the juice\r\nof 1 lemon; cayenne and salt to taste; 1/2 teaspoonful of powdered\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Stuff the carp with a delicate forcemeat, after thoroughly\r\ncleansing it, and sew it up to prevent the stuffing from falling out.\r\nRub it over with an egg, and sprinkle it with bread crumbs, lay it in a\r\ndeep earthen dish, and drop the butter, oiled, over the bread crumbs.\r\nAdd the stock, onions, bay-leaf, herbs, wine, and anchovies, and bake\r\nfor 1 hour. Put 1 oz. of butter into a stewpan, melt it, and dredge in\r\nsufficient flour to dry it up; put in the strained liquor from the carp,\r\nstir frequently, and when it has boiled, add the lemon-juice and\r\nseasoning. Serve the carp on a dish garnished with parsley and cut\r\nlemon, and the sauce in a boat.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/4 hour. _Average cost_. Seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 or 2 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CARP.]\r\n\r\n    THE CARP.--This species of fish inhabit the fresh waters, where\r\n    they feed on worms, insects, aquatic plants, small fish, clay,\r\n    or mould. Some of them are migratory. They have very small\r\n    mouths and no teeth, and the gill membrane has three rays. The\r\n    body is smooth, and generally whitish. The carp both grows and\r\n    increases very fast, and is accounted the most valuable of all\r\n    fish for the stocking of ponds. It has been pronounced the queen\r\n    of river-fish, and was first introduced to this country about\r\n    three hundred years ago. Of its sound, or air-bladder, a kind of\r\n    glue is made, and a green paint of its gall.\r\n\r\nSTEWED CARP.\r\n\r\n243. INGREDIENTS.--1 carp, salt, stock No. 105, 2 onions, 6 cloves, 12\r\npeppercorns, 1 blade of mace, 1/4 pint of port wine, the juice of 1/2\r\nlemon, cayenne and salt to taste, a faggot of savoury herbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scale the fish, clean it nicely, and, if very large, divide it;\r\nlay it in the stewpan, after having rubbed a little salt on it, and put\r\nin sufficient stock to cover it; add the herbs, onions, and spices, and\r\nstew gently for 1 hour, or rather more, should it be very large. Dish up\r\nthe fish with great care, strain the liquor, and add to it the port\r\nwine, lemon-juice, and cayenne; give one boil, pour it over the fish,\r\nand serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/4 hour. _Average cost_. Seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 or 2 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This fish can be boiled plain, and served with parsley and\r\nbutter. Chub and Char may be cooked in the same manner as the above, as\r\nalso Dace and Roach.\r\n\r\n    THE AGE OF CARP.--This fish has been found to live 150 years.\r\n    The pond in the garden of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, contained\r\n    one that had lived there 70 years, and Gesner mentions an\r\n    instance of one 100 years old. They are, besides, capable of\r\n    being tamed. Dr. Smith, in his \"Tour on the Continent,\" says, in\r\n    reference to the prince of Condé's seat at Chantilly, \"The most\r\n    pleasing things about it were the immense shoals of very large\r\n    carp, silvered over with age, like silver-fish, and perfectly\r\n    tame; so that, when any passengers approached their watery\r\n    habitation, they used to come to the shore in such numbers as to\r\n    heave each other out of the water, begging for bread, of which a\r\n    quantity was always kept at hand, on purpose to feed them. They\r\n    would even allow themselves to be handled.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHUB.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHAR.]\r\n\r\n    THE CHUB.--This fish takes its name from its head, not only in\r\n    England, but in other countries. It is a river-fish, and\r\n    resembles the carp, but is somewhat longer. Its flesh is not in\r\n    much esteem, being coarse, and, when out of season, full of\r\n    small hairy bones. The head and throat are the best parts. The\r\n    roe is also good.\r\n\r\n    THE CHAR.--This is one of the most delicious of fish, being\r\n    esteemed by some superior to the salmon. It is an inhabitant of\r\n    the deep lakes of mountainous countries. Its flesh is rich and\r\n    red, and full of fat. The largest and best kind is found in the\r\n    lakes of Westmoreland, and, as it is considered a rarity, it is\r\n    often potted and preserved.\r\n\r\n    THE DACE, OR DARE.--This fish is gregarious, and is seldom above\r\n    ten inches long; although, according to Linnaeus, it grows a\r\n    foot and a half in length. Its haunts are in deep water, near\r\n    piles of bridges, where the stream is gentle, over gravelly,\r\n    sandy, or clayey bottoms; deep holes that are shaded, water-lily\r\n    leaves, and under the foam caused by an eddy. In the warm months\r\n    they are to be found in shoals on the shallows near to streams.\r\n    They are in season about the end of April, and gradually improve\r\n    till February, when they attain their highest condition. In that\r\n    month, when just taken, scotched (crimped), and broiled, they\r\n    are said to be more palatable than a fresh herring.\r\n\r\n    THE ROACH.--This fish is found throughout Europe, and the\r\n    western parts of Asia, in deep still rivers, of which it is an\r\n    inhabitant. It is rarely more than a pound and a half in weight,\r\n    and is in season from September till March. It is plentiful in\r\n    England, and the finest are caught in the Thames. The proverb,\r\n    \"as sound as a roach,\" is derived from the French name of this\r\n    fish being _roche_, which also means rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DACE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROACH.]\r\n\r\nTO DRESS CRAB.\r\n\r\n244. INGREDIENTS.--1 crab, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1 ditto of oil;\r\nsalt, white pepper, and cayenne, to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Empty the shells, and thoroughly mix the meat with the above\r\ningredients, and put it in the large shell. Garnish with slices of cut\r\nlemon and parsley. The quantity of oil may be increased when it is much\r\nliked. (See Coloured Plate I.)\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 10d. to 2s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year; but not so good in May, June, and July.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 persons.\r\n\r\nTO CHOOSE CRAB.--The middle-sized crab is the best; and the crab, like\r\nthe lobster, should be judged by its weight; for if light, it is watery.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOT CRAB.\r\n\r\n245. INGREDIENTS.--1 crab, nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, 3 oz. of\r\nbutter, 1/4 lb. of bread crumbs, 3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--After having boiled the crab, pick the meat out from the\r\nshells, and mix with it the nutmeg and seasoning. Cut up the butter in\r\nsmall pieces, and add the bread crumbs and vinegar. Mix altogether, put\r\nthe whole in the large shell, and brown before the fire or with a\r\nsalamander.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, from 10d. to 2s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year; but not so good in May, June, and July.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CRAB.]\r\n\r\n    THE CRAB TRIBE.--The whole of this tribe of animals have the\r\n    body covered with a hard and strong shell, and they live chiefly\r\n    in the sea. Some, however, inhabit fresh waters, and a few live\r\n    upon land. They feed variously, on aquatic or marine plants,\r\n    small fish, molluscae, or dead bodies. The _black-clawed_\r\n    species is found on the rocky coasts of both Europe and India,\r\n    and is the same that is introduced to our tables, being much\r\n    more highly esteemed as a food than many others of the tribe.\r\n    The most remarkable feature in their history, is the changing of\r\n    their shells, and the reproduction of their broken claws. The\r\n    former occurs once a year, usually between Christmas and Easter,\r\n    when the crabs retire to cavities in the rocks, or conceal\r\n    themselves under great stones. Fishermen say that they will live\r\n    confined in a pot or basket for several months together, without\r\n    any other food than what is collected from the sea-water; and\r\n    that, even in this situation, they will not decrease in weight.\r\n    The _hermit_ crab is another of the species, and has the\r\n    peculiarity of taking possession of the deserted shell of some\r\n    other animal, as it has none of its own. This circumstance was\r\n    known to the ancients, and is alluded to in the following lines\r\n    from Oppian:--\r\n      The hermit fish, unarm'd by Nature, left\r\n      Helpless and weak, grow strong by harmless theft.\r\n      Fearful they stroll, and look with panting wish\r\n      For the cast crust of some new-cover'd fish;\r\n      Or such as empty lie, and deck the shore,\r\n      Whose first and rightful owners are no more.\r\n      They make glad seizure of the vacant room,\r\n      And count the borrow'd shell their native home;\r\n      Screw their soft limbs to fit the winding case,\r\n      And boldly herd with the crustaceous race.\r\n\r\nCRAYFISH.\r\n\r\n246. Crayfish should be thrown into boiling water, to which has been\r\nadded a good seasoning of salt and a little vinegar. When done, which\r\nwill be in 1/4 hour, take them out and drain them. Let them cool,\r\narrange them on a napkin, and garnish with plenty of double parsley.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This fish is frequently used for garnishing boiled turkey,\r\nboiled fowl, calf's head, turbot, and all kinds of boiled fish.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTTED CRAYFISH.\r\n\r\n247. INGREDIENTS.--100 crayfish; pounded mace, pepper and salt to taste,\r\n2 oz. butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the fish in salt and water; pick out all the meat and\r\npound it in a mortar to a paste. Whilst pounding, add the butter\r\ngradually, and mix in the spice and seasoning. Put it in small pots, and\r\npour over it clarified butter, carefully excluding the air.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 minutes to boil the crayfish. _Average cost_, 2s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN DORY.\r\n\r\n248. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of salt to each gallon of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--This fish, which is esteemed by most people a great delicacy,\r\nis dressed in the same way as a turbot, which it resembles in firmness,\r\nbut not in richness. Cleanse it thoroughly and cut off the fins; lay it\r\nin a fish-kettle, cover with cold water, and add salt in the above\r\nproportion. Bring it gradually to a boil, and simmer gently for 1/4\r\nhour, or rather longer, should the fish be very large. Serve on a hot\r\nnapkin, and garnish with cut lemon and parsley. Lobster, anchovy, or\r\nshrimp sauce, and plain melted butter, should be sent to table with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--After the water boils, 1/4 to 1/2 hour, according to size.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3s. to 5s. _Seasonable_ all the year, but best from\r\nSeptember to January.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Small John Dorie are very good, baked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE JOHN DORY.]\r\n\r\n    THE DORU, or JOHN DORY.--This fish is of a yellowish golden\r\n    colour, and is, in general, rare, although it is sometimes taken\r\n    in abundance on the Devon and Cornish coasts. It is highly\r\n    esteemed for the table, and its flesh, when dressed, is of a\r\n    beautiful clear white. When fresh caught, it is tough, and,\r\n    being a ground fish, it is not the worse for being kept two, or\r\n    even three days before it is cooked.\r\n\r\nBOILED EELS.\r\n\r\n\r\n249. INGREDIENTS.--4 small eels, sufficient water to cover them; a large\r\nbunch of parsley.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose small eels for boiling; put them in a stewpan with the\r\nparsley, and just sufficient water to cover them; simmer till tender.\r\nTake them out, pour a little parsley and butter over them, and serve\r\nsome in a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EEL.]\r\n\r\n    THE EEL TRIBE.--The Apodal, or bony-gilled and ventral-finned\r\n    fish, of which the eel forms the first Linnaean tribe, in their\r\n    general aspect and manners, approach, in some instances, very\r\n    nearly to serpents. They have a smooth head and slippery skin,\r\n    are in general naked, or covered with such small, soft, and\r\n    distant scales, as are scarcely visible. Their bodies are long\r\n    and slender, and they are supposed to subsist entirely on animal\r\n    substances. There are about nine species of them, mostly found\r\n    in the seas. One of them frequents our fresh waters, and three\r\n    of the others occasionally pay a visit to our shores.\r\n\r\nSTEWED EELS.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n250. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of eels, 1 pint of rich strong stock, No. 104,\r\n1 onion, 3 cloves, a piece of lemon-peel, 1 glass of port or Madeira, 3\r\ntablespoonfuls of cream; thickening of flour; cayenne and lemon-juice to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash and skin the eels, and cut them into pieces about 3 inches\r\nlong; pepper and salt them, and lay them in a stewpan; pour over the\r\nstock, add the onion stuck with cloves, the lemon-peel, and the wine.\r\nStew gently for 1/2 hour, or rather more, and lift them carefully on a\r\ndish, which keep hot. Strain the gravy, stir to the cream sufficient\r\nflour to thicken; mix altogether, boil for 2 minutes, and add the\r\ncayenne and lemon-juice; pour over the eels and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_ for this quantity, 2s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n    THE COMMON EEL.--This fish is known frequently to quit its\r\n    native element, and to set off on a wandering expedition in the\r\n    night, or just about the close of clay, over the meadows, in\r\n    search of snails and other prey. It also, sometimes, betakes\r\n    itself to isolated ponds, apparently for no other pleasure than\r\n    that which may be supposed to be found in a change of\r\n    habitation. This, of course, accounts for eels being found in\r\n    waters which were never suspected to contain them. This rambling\r\n    disposition in the eel has been long known to naturalists, and,\r\n    from the following lines, it seems to have been known to the\r\n    ancients:--\r\n\r\n      \"Thus the mail'd tortoise, and the wand'ring; eel,\r\n      Oft to the neighbouring beach will silent steal.\"\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n251. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of middling-sized eels, 1 pint of medium\r\nstock, No. 105, 1/4 pint of port wine; salt, cayenne, and mace to taste;\r\n1 teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, the juice of 1/2 a lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Skin, wash, and clean the eels thoroughly; cut them into pieces\r\n3 inches long, and put them into strong salt and water for 1 hour; dry\r\nthem well with a cloth, and fry them brown. Put the stock on with the\r\nheads and tails of the eels, and simmer for 1/2 hour; strain it, and add\r\nall the other ingredients. Put in the eels, and stew gently for 1/2\r\nhour, when serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED EELS.\r\n\r\n252. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of eels, 1 egg, a few bread crumbs, hot lard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the eels, cut them into pieces 3 inches long, trim and\r\nwipe them very dry; dredge with flour, rub them over with egg, and cover\r\nwith bread crumbs; fry of a nice brown in hot lard. If the eels are\r\nsmall, curl them round, instead of cutting them up. Garnish with fried\r\nparsley.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes, or rather less. _Average cost_, 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Garfish may be dressed like eels, and either broiled or baked.\r\n\r\n    THE PRODUCTIVENESS OF THE EEL.--\"Having occasion,\" says Dr.\r\n    Anderson, in the _Bee_, \"to be once on a visit to a friend's\r\n    house on Dee-side, in Aberdeenshire, I frequently delighted to\r\n    walk by the banks of the river. I, one day, observed something\r\n    like a black string moving along the edge of the water where it\r\n    was quite shallow. Upon closer inspection, I discovered that\r\n    this was a shoal of young eels, so closely joined together as to\r\n    appear, on a superficial view, on continued body, moving briskly\r\n    up against the stream. To avoid the retardment they experienced\r\n    from the force of the current, they kept close along the water's\r\n    edge the whole of the way, following all the bendings and\r\n    sinuosities of the river. Where they were embayed, and in still\r\n    water, the shoal dilated in breadth, so as to be sometimes\r\n    nearly a foot broad; but when they turned a cape, where the\r\n    current was strong, they were forced to occupy less space and\r\n    press close to the shore, struggling very hard till they passed\r\n    it. This shoal continued to move on, night and day without\r\n    interruption for several weeks. Their progress might be at the\r\n    rate of about a mile an hour. It was easy to catch the animals,\r\n    though they were very active and nimble. They were eels\r\n    perfectly well formed in every respect, but not exceeding two\r\n    inches in length. I conceive that the shoal did not contain, on\r\n    an average, less than from twelve to twenty in breadth; so that\r\n    the number that passed, on the whole, must have been very great.\r\n    Whence they came or whither they went, I know not; but the place\r\n    where I saw this, was six miles from the sea.\"\r\n\r\nEEL PIE.\r\n\r\n253. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of eels, a little chopped parsley, 1 shalot;\r\ngrated nutmeg; pepper and salt to taste; the juice of 1/2 a lemon, small\r\nquantity of forcemeat, 1/4 pint of béchamel (see Sauces); puff paste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Skin and wash the eels, cut them into pieces 2 inches long, and\r\nline the bottom of the pie-dish with forcemeat. Put in the eels, and\r\nsprinkle them with the parsley, shalots, nutmeg, seasoning, and\r\nlemon-juice, and cover with puff-paste. Bake for 1 hour, or rather more;\r\nmake the béchamel hot, and pour it into the pie.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLARED EEL.\r\n\r\n254. INGREDIENTS.--1 large eel; pepper and salt to taste; 2 blades of\r\nmace, 2 cloves, a little allspice very finely pounded, 6 leaves of sage,\r\nand a small bunch of herbs minced very small.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Bone the eel and skin it; split it, and sprinkle it over with\r\nthe ingredients, taking care that the spices are very finely pounded,\r\nand the herbs chopped very small. Roll it up and bind with a broad piece\r\nof tape, and boil it in water, mixed with a little salt and vinegar,\r\ntill tender. It may either be served whole or cut in slices; and when\r\ncold, the eel should be kept in the liquor it was boiled in, but with a\r\nlittle more vinegar put to it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\n    HAUNTS OF THE EEL.--These are usually in mud, among weeds, under\r\n    roots or stumps of trees, or in holes in the banks or the\r\n    bottoms of rivers. Here they often grow to an enormous size,\r\n    sometimes weighing as much as fifteen or sixteen pounds. They\r\n    seldom come forth from their hiding-places except in the night;\r\n    and, in winter, bury themselves deep in the mud, on account of\r\n    their great susceptibility of cold.\r\n\r\nEELS A LA TARTARE.\r\n\r\n255. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of eels, 1 carrot, 1 onion, a little flour, 1\r\nglass of sherry; salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste; bread crumbs, 1 egg,\r\n2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the butter on the bottom of the stewpan; cut up the carrot\r\nand onion, and stir them over the fire for 5 minutes; dredge in a little\r\nflour, add the wine and seasoning, and boil for 1/2 an hour. Skin and\r\nwash the eels, cut them into pieces, put them to the other ingredients,\r\nand simmer till tender. When they are done, take them out, let them get\r\ncold, cover them with egg and bread crumbs, and fry them of a nice\r\nbrown. Put them on a dish, pour sauce piquante over, and serve them hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 8d., exclusive of the sauce\r\npiquante.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March. _Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n    VORACITY OF THE EEL.--We find in a note upon Isaac Walton, by\r\n    Sir John Hawkins, that he knew of eels, when kept in ponds,\r\n    frequently destroying ducks. From a canal near his house at\r\n    Twickenham he himself missed many young ducks; and on draining,\r\n    in order to clean it, great numbers of large eels were caught in\r\n    the mud. When some of these were opened, there were found in\r\n    their stomachs the undigested heads of the quacking tribe which\r\n    had become their victims.\r\n\r\nEELS EN MATELOTE.\r\n\r\n256. INGREDIENTS.--5 or 6 young onions, a few mushrooms, when\r\nobtainable; salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste; 1 laurel-leaf, 1/2 pint\r\nof port wine, 1/2 pint of medium stock, No. 105; butter and flour to\r\nthicken; 2 lbs. of eels.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the stewpan with butter, dredge in a little flour, add the\r\nonions cut very small, slightly brown them, and put in all the other\r\ningredients. Wash, and cut up the eels into pieces 3 inches long; put\r\nthem in the stewpan, and simmer for 1/2 hour. Make round the dish, a\r\nborder of croutons, or pieces of toasted bread; arrange the eels in a\r\npyramid in the centre, and pour over the sauce. Serve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. Average cost, 1s. 9d. for this quantity.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March. _Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n    TENACITY OF LIFE IN THE EEL.--There is no fish so tenacious of\r\n    life as this. After it is skinned and cut in pieces, the parts\r\n    will continue to move for a considerable time, and no fish will\r\n    live so long out of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAMPREY.]\r\n\r\n    THE LAMPREY.--With the Romans, this fish occupied a respectable\r\n    rank among the piscine tribes, and in Britain it has at various\r\n    periods stood high in public favour. It was the cause of the\r\n    death of Henry I. of England, who ate so much of them, that it\r\n    brought on an attack of indigestion, which carried him off. It\r\n    is an inhabitant of the sea, ascending rivers, principally about\r\n    the end of winter, and, after passing a few months in fresh\r\n    water, returning again to its oceanic residence. It is most in\r\n    season in March, April, and May, but is, by some, regarded as an\r\n    unwholesome food, although looked on by others as a great\r\n    delicacy. They are dressed as eels.\r\n\r\nFISH AND OYSTER PIE.\r\n\r\n257. INGREDIENTS.--Any remains of cold fish, such as cod or haddock; 2\r\ndozen oysters, pepper and salt to taste, bread crumbs sufficient for the\r\nquantity of fish; 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful of\r\nfinely-chopped parsley.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clear the fish from the bones, and put a layer of it in a\r\npie-dish, which sprinkle with pepper and salt; then a layer of bread\r\ncrumbs, oysters, nutmeg, and chopped parsley. Repeat this till the dish\r\nis quite full. You may form a covering either of bread crumbs, which\r\nshould be browned, or puff-paste, which should be cut into long strips,\r\nand laid in cross-bars over the fish, with a line of the paste first\r\nlaid round the edge. Before putting on the top, pour in some made melted\r\nbutter, or a little thin white sauce, and the oyster-liquor, and bake.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--If made of cooked fish, 1/4 hour; if made of fresh fish and\r\npuff-paste, 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A nice little dish may be made by flaking any cold fish, adding\r\na few oysters, seasoning with pepper and salt, and covering with mashed\r\npotatoes; 1/4 hour will bake it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH CAKE.\r\n\r\n258. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of any cold fish, 1 onion, 1 faggot of\r\nsweet herbs; salt and pepper to taste, 1 pint of water, equal quantities\r\nof bread crumbs and cold potatoes, 1/2 teaspoonful of parsley, 1 egg,\r\nbread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the meat from the bones of the fish, which latter put,\r\nwith the head and fins, into a stewpan with the water; add pepper and\r\nsalt, the onion and herbs, and stew slowly for gravy about 2 hours; chop\r\nthe fish fine, and mix it well with bread crumbs and cold potatoes,\r\nadding the parsley and seasoning; make the whole into a cake with the\r\nwhite of an egg, brush it over with egg, cover with bread crumbs, and\r\nfry of a light brown; strain the gravy, pour it over, and stew gently\r\nfor 1/4 hour, stirring it carefully once or twice. Serve hot, and\r\ngarnish with slices of lemon and parsley.\r\n\r\n_Time_--1/2 hour, after the gravy is made.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED FLOUNDERS.\r\n\r\n259. INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient water to cover the flounders, salt in the\r\nproportion of 6 oz. to each gallon, a little vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pat on a kettle with enough water to cover the flounders, lay\r\nin the fish, add salt and vinegar in the above proportions, and when it\r\nboils, simmer very gently for 5 minutes. They must not boil fast, or\r\nthey will break. Serve with plain melted butter, or parsley and butter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--After the water boils, 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to November.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOUNDERS.]\r\n\r\n    THE FLOUNDER.--This comes under the tribe usually denominated\r\n    Flat-fish, and is generally held in the smallest estimation of\r\n    any among them. It is an inhabitant of both the seas and the\r\n    rivers, while it thrives in ponds. On the English coasts it is\r\n    very abundant, and the London market consumes it in large\r\n    quantities. It is considered easy of digestion, and the Thames\r\n    flounder is esteemed a delicate fish.\r\n\r\nFRIED FLOUNDERS.\r\n\r\n260. INGREDIENTS.--Flounders, egg, and bread crumbs; boiling lard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cleanse the fish, and, two hours before they are wanted, rub\r\nthem inside and out with salt, to render them firm; wash and wipe them\r\nvery dry, dip them into egg, and sprinkle over with bread crumbs; fry\r\nthem in boiling lard, dish on a hot napkin, and garnish with crisped\r\nparsley.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 5 to 10 minutes, according to size.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to November.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, 1 for each person.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUDGEONS.\r\n\r\n261. INGREDIENTS.--Egg and bread crumbs sufficient for the quantity of\r\nfish; hot lard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Do not scrape off the scales, but take out the gills and\r\ninside, and cleanse thoroughly; wipe them dry, flour and dip them into\r\negg, and sprinkle over with bread crumbs. Fry of a nice brown.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 or 4 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_. Seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to July.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, 3 for each person.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GUDGEON.]\r\n\r\n    THE GUDGEON.--This is a fresh-water fish, belonging to the carp\r\n    genus, and is found in placid streams and lakes. It was highly\r\n    esteemed by the Greeks, and was, at the beginning of supper,\r\n    served fried at Rome. It abounds both in France and Germany; and\r\n    is both excellent and numerous in some of the rivers of England.\r\n    Its flesh is firm, well-flavoured, and easily digested.\r\n\r\nGURNET, or GURNARD.\r\n\r\n262. INGREDIENTS.--1 gurnet, 6 oz. of salt to each gallon of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cleanse the fish thoroughly, and cut off the fins; have ready\r\nsome boiling water, with salt in the above proportion; put the fish in,\r\nand simmer very gently for 1/2 hour. Parsley and butter, or anchovy\r\nsauce, should be served with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_. Seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March, but in perfection in October.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, a middling sized one for 2 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This fish is frequently stuffed with forcemeat and baked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GURNET.]\r\n\r\n    THE GURNET.-\"If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a souced\r\n    gurnet,\" says Falstaff; which shows that this fish has been long\r\n    known in England. It is very common on the British coasts, and\r\n    is an excellent fish as food.\r\n\r\nBAKED HADDOCKS.\r\n\r\n263. INGREDIENTS.--A nice forcemeat (_see_ Forcemeats), butter to taste,\r\negg and bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scale and clean the fish, without cutting it open much; put in\r\na nice delicate forcemeat, and sew up the slit. Brush it over with egg,\r\nsprinkle over bread crumbs, and baste frequently with butter. Garnish\r\nwith parsley and cut lemon, and serve with a nice brown gravy, plain\r\nmelted butter, or anchovy sauce. The egg and bread crumbs can be\r\nomitted, and pieces of butter placed over the fish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Large haddock, 3/4 hour; moderate size, 1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to February.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 9d. upwards.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Haddocks may be filleted, rubbed over with egg and bread\r\ncrumbs, and fried a nice brown; garnish with crisped parsley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HADDOCK.]\r\n\r\n    THE HADDOCK.--This fish migrates in immense shoals, and arrives\r\n    on the Yorkshire coast about the middle of winter. It is an\r\n    inhabitant of the northern seas of Europe, but does not enter\r\n    the Baltic, and is not known in the Mediterranean. On each side\r\n    of the body, just beyond the gills, it has a dark spot, which\r\n    superstition asserts to be the impressions of the finger and\r\n    thumb of St. Peter, when taking the tribute money out of a fish\r\n    of this species.\r\n\r\nBOILED HADDOCK.\r\n\r\n264. INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient water to cover the fish; 1/4 lb. of salt\r\nto each gallon of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scrape the fish, take out the inside, wash it thoroughly, and\r\nlay it in a kettle, with enough water to cover it and salt in the above\r\nproportion. Simmer gently from 15 to 20 minutes, or rather more, should\r\nthe fish be very large. For small haddocks, fasten the tails in their\r\nmouths, and put them into boiling water. 10 to 15 minutes will cook\r\nthem. Serve with plain melted butter, or anchovy sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Large haddock, 1/2 hour; small, 1/4 hour, or rather less.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 9d. upwards.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to February.\r\n\r\n    WEIGHT OF THE HADDOCK.--The haddock seldom grows to any great\r\n    size. In general, they do not weigh more than two or three\r\n    pounds, or exceed ten or twelve inches in size. Such are\r\n    esteemed very delicate eating; but they have been caught three\r\n    feet long, when their flesh is coarse.\r\n\r\nDRIED HADDOCK.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n265. Dried haddock should be gradually warmed through, either before or\r\nover a nice clear fire. Hub a little piece of butter over, just before\r\nsending it to table.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n266. INGREDIENTS.--1 large thick haddock, 2 bay-leaves, 1 small bunch of\r\nsavoury herbs, not forgetting parsley, a little butter and pepper;\r\nboiling water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the haddock into square pieces, make a basin hot by\r\nmeans of hot water, which pour out. Lay in the fish, with the bay-leaves\r\nand herbs; cover with boiling water; put a plate over to keep in the\r\nsteam, and let it remain for 10 minutes. Take out the slices, put them\r\nin a hot dish, rub over with butter and pepper, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes. _Seasonable_ at any time, but best in winter.\r\n\r\n    THE FINNAN HADDOCK.--This is the common haddock cured and dried,\r\n    and takes its name from the fishing-village of Findhorn, near\r\n    Aberdeen, in Scotland, where the art has long attained to\r\n    perfection. The haddocks are there hung up for a day or two in\r\n    the smoke of peat, when they are ready for cooking, and are\r\n    esteemed, by the Scotch, a great delicacy. In London, an\r\n    imitation of them is made by washing the fish over with\r\n    pyroligneous acid, and hanging it up in a dry place for a few\r\n    days.\r\n\r\nRED HERRINGS, or YARMOUTH BLOATERS.\r\n\r\n267. The best way to cook these is to make incisions in the skin across\r\nthe fish, because they do not then require to be so long on the fire,\r\nand will be far better than when cut open. The hard roe makes a nice\r\nrelish by pounding it in a mortar, with a little anchovy, and spreading\r\nit on toast. If very dry, soak in warm water 1 hour before dressing.\r\n\r\n    THE RED HERRING.--_Red_ herrings lie twenty-four hours in the\r\n    brine, when they are taken out and hung up in a smoking-house\r\n    formed to receive them. A brushwood fire is then kindled beneath\r\n    them, and when they are sufficiently smoked and dried, they are\r\n    put into barrels for carriage.\r\n\r\nBAKED WHITE HERRINGS.\r\n\r\n268. INGREDIENTS.--12 herrings, 4 bay-leaves, 12 cloves, 12 allspice, 2\r\nsmall blades of mace, cayenne pepper and salt to taste, sufficient\r\nvinegar to fill up the dish.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take the herrings, cut off the heads, and gut them. Put them in\r\na pie-dish, heads and tails alternately, and, between each layer,\r\nsprinkle over the above ingredients. Cover the fish with the vinegar,\r\nand bake for 1/2 hour, but do not use it till quite cold. The herrings\r\nmay be cut down the front, the backbone taken out, and closed again.\r\nSprats done in this way are very delicious.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 an hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1d. each.\r\n\r\nTO CHOOSE THE HERRING.--The more scales this fish has, the surer the\r\nsign of its freshness. It should also have a bright and silvery look;\r\nbut if red about the head, it is a sign that it has been dead for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HERRING.]\r\n\r\n    THE HERRING.--The herring tribe are found in the greatest\r\n    abundance in the highest northern latitudes, where they find a\r\n    quiet retreat, and security from their numerous enemies. Here\r\n    they multiply beyond expression, and, in shoals, come forth from\r\n    their icy region to visit other portions of the great deep. In\r\n    June they are found about Shetland, whence they proceed down to\r\n    the Orkneys, where they divide, and surround the islands of\r\n    Great Britain and Ireland. The principal British\r\n    herring-fisheries are off the Scotch and Norfolk coasts; and the\r\n    fishing is always carried on by means of nets, which are usually\r\n    laid at night; for, if stretched by day, they are supposed to\r\n    frighten the fish away. The moment the herring is taken out of\r\n    the water it dies. Hence the origin of the common saying, \"dead\r\n    as a herring.\"\r\n\r\nKEGEREE.\r\n\r\n269. INGREDIENTS.--Any cold fish, 1 teacupful of boiled rice, 1 oz. of\r\nbutter, 1 teaspoonful of mustard, 2 soft-boiled eggs, salt and cayenne\r\nto taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the fish carefully from the bones, mix with the other\r\ningredients, and serve very hot. The quantities may be varied according\r\nto the amount of fish used.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour after the rice is boiled.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 5d., exclusive of the fish.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BOIL LOBSTERS.\r\n\r\n270. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of salt to each gallon of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Buy the lobsters alive, and choose those that are heavy and\r\nfull of motion, which is an indication of their freshness. When the\r\nshell is incrusted, it is a sign they are old: medium-sized lobsters are\r\nthe best. Have ready a stewpan of boiling water, salted in the above\r\nproportion; put in the lobster, and keep it boiling quickly from 20\r\nminutes to 3/4 hour, according to its size, and do not forget to skim\r\nwell. If it boils too long, the meat becomes thready, and if not done\r\nenough, the spawn is not red: this must be obviated by great attention.\r\nHub the shell over with a little butter or sweet oil, which wipe off\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Small lobster, 20 minutes to 1/2 hour; large ditto, 1/2 to 1/3\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, medium size, 1s. 6d. to 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but best from March to October.\r\n\r\nTO CHOOSE LOBSTERS.--This shell-fish, if it has been cooked alive, as it\r\nought to have been, will have a stiffness in the tail, which, if gently\r\nraised, will return with a spring. Care, however, must be taken in thus\r\nproving it; for if the tail is pulled straight out, it will not return;\r\nwhen the fish might be pronounced inferior, which, in reality, may not\r\nbe the case. In order to be good, lobsters should be weighty for their\r\nbulk; if light, they will be watery; and those of the medium size, are\r\nalways the best. Small-sized lobsters are cheapest, and answer very well\r\nfor sauce. In boiling lobsters, the appearance of the shell will be much\r\nimproved by rubbing over it a little butter or salad-oil on being\r\nimmediately taken from the pot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LOBSTER.]\r\n\r\n    THE LOBSTER.--This is one of the crab tribe, and is found on\r\n    most of the rocky coasts of Great Britain. Some are caught with\r\n    the hand, but the larger number in pots, which serve all the\r\n    purposes of a trap, being made of osiers, and baited with\r\n    garbage. They are shaped like a wire mousetrap; so that when the\r\n    lobsters once enter them, they cannot get out again. They are\r\n    fastened to a cord and sunk in the sea, and their place marked\r\n    by a buoy. The fish is very prolific, and deposits of its eggs\r\n    in the sand, where they are soon hatched. On the coast of\r\n    Norway, they are very abundant, and it is from there that the\r\n    English metropolis is mostly supplied. They are rather\r\n    indigestible, and, as a food, not so nurtritive as they are\r\n    generally supposed to be.\r\n\r\nHOT LOBSTER.\r\n\r\n271. INGREDIENTS.--1 lobster, 2 oz. of butter, grated nutmeg; salt,\r\npepper, and pounded mace, to taste; bread crumbs, 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pound the meat of the lobster to a smooth paste with the butter\r\nand seasoning, and add a few bread crumbs. Beat the eggs, and make the\r\nwhole mixture into the form of a lobster; pound the spawn, and sprinkle\r\nover it. Bake 1/4 hour, and just before serving, lay over it the tail\r\nand body shell, with the small claws underneath, to resemble a lobster.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour. _Average cost_, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOBSTER SALAD.\r\n\r\n272. INGREDIENTS.--1 hen lobster, lettuces, endive, small salad\r\n(whatever is in season), a little chopped beetroot, 2 hard-boiled eggs,\r\na few slices of cucumber. For dressing, equal quantities of oil and\r\nvinegar, 1 teaspoonful of made mustard, the yolks of 2 eggs; cayenne and\r\nsalt to taste; 3 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce. These ingredients should\r\nbe mixed perfectly smooth, and form a creamy-looking sauce.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the salad, and thoroughly dry it by shaking it in a cloth.\r\nCut up the lettuces and endive, pour the dressing on them, and lightly\r\nthrow in the small salad. Mix all well together with the pickings from\r\nthe body of the lobster; pick the meat from the shell, cut it up into\r\nnice square pieces, put half in the salad, the other half reserve for\r\ngarnishing. Separate the yolks from the whites of 2 hard-boiled eggs;\r\nchop the whites very fine, and rub the yolks through a sieve, and\r\nafterwards the coral from the inside. Arrange the salad lightly on a\r\nglass dish, and garnish, first with a row of sliced cucumber, then with\r\nthe pieces of lobster, the yolks and whites of the eggs, coral, and\r\nbeetroot placed alternately, and arranged in small separate bunches, so\r\nthat the colours contrast nicely.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3s. 6d. _Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to October; may be had all the year, but salad\r\nis scarce and expensive in winter.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A few crayfish make a pretty garnishing to lobster salad.\r\n\r\n    THE SHELL OF THE LOBSTER.--Like the others of its tribe, the\r\n    lobster annually casts its shell. Previously to its throwing off\r\n    the old one, it appears sick, languid, and restless, but in the\r\n    course of a few days it is entirely invested in its new coat of\r\n    armour. Whilst it is in a defenceless state, however, it seeks\r\n    some lonely place, where it may lie undisturbed, and escape the\r\n    horrid fate of being devoured by some of its own species who\r\n    have the advantage of still being encased in their mail.\r\n\r\nLOBSTER (a la Mode Francaise).\r\n\r\n273. INGREDIENTS.--1 lobster, 4 tablespoonfuls of white stock, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of cream, pounded mace, and cayenne to taste; bread\r\ncrumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the meat from the shell, and cut it up into small square\r\npieces; put the stock, cream, and seasoning into a stewpan, add the\r\nlobster, and let it simmer gently for 6 minutes. Serve it in the shell,\r\nwhich must be nicely cleaned, and have a border of puff-paste; cover it\r\nwith bread crumbs, place small pieces of butter over, and brown before\r\nthe fire, or with a salamander.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour. _Average cost_, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    CELERITY OF THE LOBSTER.--In its element, the lobster is able to\r\n    run with great speed upon its legs, or small claws, and, if\r\n    alarmed, to spring, tail foremost, to a considerable distance,\r\n    \"even,\" it is said, \"with the swiftness of a bird flying.\"\r\n    Fishermen have seen some of them pass about thirty feet with a\r\n    wonderful degree of swiftness. When frightened, they will take\r\n    their spring, and, like a chamois of the Alps, plant themselves\r\n    upon the very spot upon which they designed to hold themselves.\r\n\r\nLOBSTER CURRY (an Entree).\r\n\r\n274. INGREDIENTS.--1 lobster, 2 onions, 1 oz. butter, 1 tablespoonful of\r\ncurry-powder, 1/2 pint of medium stock, No. 105, the juice of 1/2 lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the meat from the shell, and cut it into nice square\r\npieces; fry the onions of a pale brown in the butter, stir in the\r\ncurry-powder and stock, and simmer till it thickens, when put in the\r\nlobster; stew the whole slowly for 1/2 hour, and stir occasionally; and\r\njust before sending to table, put in the lemon-juice. Serve boiled rice\r\nwith it, the same as for other curries.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 3s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOBSTER CUTLETS (an Entree).\r\n\r\n275. INGREDIENTS.--1 large hen lobster, 1 oz. fresh butter, 1/2\r\nsaltspoonful of salt, pounded mace, grated nutmeg, cayenne and white\r\npepper to taste, egg, and bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the meat from the shell, and pound it in a mortar with the\r\nbutter, and gradually add the mace and seasoning, well mixing the\r\ningredients; beat all to a smooth paste, and add a little of the spawn;\r\ndivide the mixture into pieces of an equal size, and shape them like\r\ncutlets. They should not be very thick. Brush them over with egg, and\r\nsprinkle with bread crumbs, and stick a short piece of the small claw in\r\nthe top of each; fry them of a nice brown in boiling lard, and drain\r\nthem before the fire, on a sieve reversed; arrange them nicely on a\r\ndish, and pour béchamel in the middle, but not over the cutlets.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 8 minutes after the cutlets are made.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this dish, 2s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year. _Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n    ANCIENT MODE OF COOKING THE LOBSTER.--When this fish was to be\r\n    served for the table, among the ancients, it was opened\r\n    lengthwise, and filled with a gravy composed of coriander and\r\n    pepper. It was then put on the gridiron and slowly cooked,\r\n    whilst it was being basted with the same kind of gravy with\r\n    which the flesh had become impregnated.\r\n\r\nTO DRESS LOBSTERS.\r\n\r\n276. When the lobster is boiled, rub it over with a little salad-oil,\r\nwhich wipe off again; separate the body from the tail, break off the\r\ngreat claws, and crack them at the joints, without injuring the meat;\r\nsplit the tail in halves, and arrange all neatly in a dish, with the\r\nbody upright in the middle, and garnish with parsley. (_See_ Coloured\r\nPlate, H.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOBSTER PATTIES (an Entree).\r\n\r\n277. INGREDIENTS.--Minced lobster, 4 tablespoonfuls of béchamel, 6 drops\r\nof anchovy sauce, lemon-juice, cayenne to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Line the patty-pans with puff-paste, and put into each a small\r\npiece of bread: cover with paste, brush over with egg, and bake of a\r\nlight colour. Take as much lobster as is required, mince the meat very\r\nfine, and add the above ingredients; stir it over the fire for 6\r\nminutes; remove the lids of the patty-cases, take out the bread, fill\r\nwith the mixture, and replace the covers.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    LOCAL ATTACHMENT OF THE LOBSTER.--It is said that the attachment\r\n    of this animal is strong to some particular parts of the sea, a\r\n    circumstance celebrated in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n      \"Nought like their home the constant lobsters prize,\r\n      And foreign shores and seas unknown despise.\r\n      Though cruel hands the banish'd wretch expel,\r\n      And force the captive from his native cell,\r\n      He will, if freed, return with anxious care,\r\n      Find the known rock, and to his home repair;\r\n      No novel customs learns in different seas,\r\n      But wonted food and home-taught manners please.\"\r\n\r\nPOTTED LOBSTER.\r\n\r\n278. INGREDIENTS.--2 lobsters; seasoning to taste, of nutmeg, pounded\r\nmace, white pepper, and salt; 1/4 lb. of butter, 3 or 4 bay-leaves.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take out the meat carefully from the shell, but do not cut it\r\nup. Put some butter at the bottom of a dish, lay in the lobster as\r\nevenly as possible, with the bay-leaves and seasoning between. Cover\r\nwith butter, and bake for 3/4 hour in a gentle oven. When done, drain\r\nthe whole on a sieve, and lay the pieces in potting-jars, with the\r\nseasoning about them. When cold, pour over it clarified butter, and, if\r\nvery highly seasoned, it will keep some time.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_ for this quantity, 4s. 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Potted lobster may be used cold, or as _fricassee_ with cream\r\nsauce.\r\n\r\n    How the Lobster Feeds.--The pincers of the lobster's large claws\r\n    are furnished with nobs, and those of the other, are always\r\n    serrated. With the former, it keeps firm hold of the stalks of\r\n    submarine plants, and with the latter, it cuts and minces its\r\n    food with great dexterity. The knobbed, or numb claw, as it is\r\n    called by fishermen, is sometimes on the right and sometimes on\r\n    the left, indifferently.\r\n\r\nBAKED MACKEREL.\r\n\r\n279. INGREDIENTS.--4 middling-sized mackerel, a nice delicate forcemeat\r\n(_see_ Forcemeats), 3 oz. of butter; pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clean the fish, take out the roes, and fill up with forcemeat,\r\nand sew up the slit. Flour, and put them in a dish, heads and tails\r\nalternately, with the roes; and, between each layer, put some little\r\npieces of butter, and pepper and salt. Bake for 1/2 an hour, and either\r\nserve with plain melted butter or a _maître d'hôtel_ sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_ for this quantity, 1s. 10d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to July.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Baked mackerel may be dressed in the same way as baked herrings\r\n(_see_ No. 268), and may also be stewed in wine.\r\n\r\n    WEIGHT OF THE MACKEREL.--The greatest weight of this fish seldom\r\n    exceeds 2 lbs., whilst their ordinary length runs between 14 and\r\n    20 inches. They die almost immediately after they are taken from\r\n    their element, and, for a short time, exhibit a phosphoric\r\n    light.\r\n\r\nBOILED MACKEREL.\r\n\r\n280. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of salt to each gallon of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cleanse the inside of the fish thoroughly, and lay it in the\r\nkettle with sufficient water to cover it with salt as above; bring it\r\ngradually to boil, skim well, and simmer gently till done; dish them on\r\na hot napkin, heads and tails alternately, and garnish with fennel.\r\nFennel sauce and plain melted butter are the usual accompaniments to\r\nboiled mackerel; but caper or anchovy sauce is sometimes served with it.\r\n(_See_ Coloured Plate, F.)\r\n\r\n_Time_.--After the water boils, 10 minutes; for large mackerel, allow\r\nmore time.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to July.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--When variety is desired, fillet the mackerel, boil it, and pour\r\nover parsley and butter; send some of this, besides, in a tureen.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED MACKEREL.\r\n\r\n281. INGREDIENTS.--Pepper and salt to taste, a small quantity of oil.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mackerel should never be washed when intended to be broiled,\r\nbut merely wiped very clean and dry, after taking out the gills and\r\ninsides. Open the back, and put in a little pepper, salt, and oil; broil\r\nit over a clear fire, turn it over on both sides, and also on the back.\r\nWhen sufficiently cooked, the flesh can be detached from the bone, which\r\nwill be in about 15 minutes for a small mackerel. Chop a little parsley,\r\nwork it up in the butter, with pepper and salt to taste, and a squeeze\r\nof lemon-juice, and put it in the back. Serve before the butter is quite\r\nmelted, with a _maître d'hôtel_ sauce in a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Small mackerel 15 minutes. _Average cost_, from 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MACKEREL.]\r\n\r\n    THE MACKEREL.--This is not only one of the most\r\n    elegantly-formed, but one of the most beautifully-coloured\r\n    fishes, when taken out of the sea, that we have. Death, in some\r\n    degree, impairs the vivid splendour of its colours; but it does\r\n    not entirely obliterate them. It visits the shores of Great\r\n    Britain in countless shoals, appearing about March, off the\r\n    Land's End; in the bays of Devonshire, about April; off Brighton\r\n    in the beginning of May; and on the coast of Suffolk about the\r\n    beginning of June. In the Orkneys they are seen till August; but\r\n    the greatest fishery is on the west coasts of England.\r\n\r\nTO CHOOSE MACKEREL.--In choosing this fish, purchasers should, to a\r\ngreat extent, be regulated by the brightness of its appearance. If it\r\nhave a transparent, silvery hue, the flesh is good; but if it be red\r\nabout the head, it is stale.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILLETS OF MACKEREL.\r\n\r\n282. INGREDIENTS.--2 large mackerel, 1 oz. butter, 1 small bunch of\r\nchopped herbs, 3 tablespoonfuls of medium stock, No. 105, 3\r\ntablespoonfuls of béchamel (_see_ Sauces); salt, cayenne, and\r\nlemon-juice to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clean the fish, and fillet it; scald the herbs, chop them fine,\r\nand put them with the butter and stock into a stewpan. Lay in the\r\nmackerel, and simmer very gently for 10 minutes; take them out, and put\r\nthem on a hot dish. Dredge in a little flour, add the other ingredients,\r\ngive one boil, and pour it over the mackerel.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes. _Average cost_ for this quantity, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to July.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Fillets of mackerel may be covered with egg and bread crumbs,\r\nand fried of a nice brown. Serve with _maître d'hôtel_ sauce and plain\r\nmelted butter.\r\n\r\n    THE VORACITY OF THE MACKEREL.--The voracity of this fish is very\r\n    great, and, from their immense numbers, they are bold in\r\n    attacking objects of which they might, otherwise, be expected to\r\n    have a wholesome dread. Pontoppidan relates an anecdote of a\r\n    sailor belonging to a ship lying in one of the harbours on the\r\n    coast of Norway, who, having gone into the sea to bathe, was\r\n    suddenly missed by his companions; in the course of a few\r\n    minutes, however, he was seen on the surface, with great numbers\r\n    of mackerel clinging to him by their mouths. His comrades\r\n    hastened in a boat to his assistance; but when they had struck\r\n    the fishes from him and got him up, they found he was so\r\n    severely bitten, that he shortly afterward expired.\r\n\r\nPICKLED MACKEREL.\r\n\r\n283. INGREDIENTS.--12 peppercorns, 2 bay-leaves, 1/2 pint of vinegar, 4\r\nmackerel.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the mackerel as in the recipe No. 282, and lay them in a\r\ndish; take half the liquor they were boiled in; add as much vinegar,\r\npeppercorns, and bay-leaves; boil for 10 minutes, and when cold, pour\r\nover the fish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n    MACKEREL GARUM.--This brine, so greatly esteemed by the\r\n    ancients, was manufactured from various kinds of fishes. When\r\n    mackerel was employed, a few of them were placed in a small\r\n    vase, with a large quantity of salt, which was well stirred, and\r\n    then left to settle for some hours. On the following day, this\r\n    was put into an earthen pot, which was uncovered, and placed in\r\n    a situation to get the rays of the sun. At the end of two or\r\n    three months, it was hermetically sealed, after having had added\r\n    to it a quantity of old wine, equal to one third of the mixture.\r\n\r\nGREY MULLET.\r\n\r\n284. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of salt to each gallon of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--If the fish be very large, it should be laid in cold water, and\r\ngradually brought to a boil; if small, put it in boiling water, salted\r\nin the above proportion. Serve with anchovy sauce and plain melted\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--According to size, 1/4 to 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to October.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREY MULLET.]\r\n\r\n    THE GREY MULLET.--This is quite a different fish from the red\r\n    mullet, is abundant on the sandy coasts of Great Britain, and\r\n    ascends rivers for miles. On the south coast it is very\r\n    plentiful, and is considered a fine fish. It improves more than\r\n    any other salt-water fish when kept in ponds.\r\n\r\nRED MULLET.\r\n\r\n285. INGREDIENTS.--Oiled paper, thickening of butter and flour, 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of anchovy sauce, 1 glass of sherry; cayenne and salt to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clean the fish, take out the gills, but leave the inside, fold\r\nin oiled paper, and bake them gently. When done, take the liquor that\r\nflows from the fish, add a thickening of butter kneaded with flour; put\r\nin the other ingredients, and let it boil for 2 minutes. Serve the sauce\r\nin a tureen, and the fish, either with or without the paper cases.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 25 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time, but more plentiful in summer.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Red mullet may be broiled, and should be folded in oiled paper,\r\nthe same as in the preceding recipe, and seasoned with pepper and salt.\r\nThey may be served without sauce; but if any is required, use melted\r\n_butter_, Italian or anchovy sauce. They should never be plain boiled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STRIPED RED MULLET.]\r\n\r\n    THE STRIPED RED MULLET.--This fish was very highly esteemed by\r\n    the ancients, especially by the Romans, who gave the most\r\n    extravagant prices for it. Those of 2 lbs. weight were valued at\r\n    about £15 each; those of 4 lbs. at £60, and, in the reign of\r\n    Tiberius, three of them were sold for £209. To witness the\r\n    changing loveliness of their colour during their dying agonies,\r\n    was one of the principal reasons that such a high price was paid\r\n    for one of these fishes. It frequents our Cornish and Sussex\r\n    coasts, and is in high request, the flesh being firm, white, and\r\n    well flavoured.\r\n\r\nFRIED OYSTERS.\r\n\r\n286. INGREDIENTS.--3 dozen oysters, 2 oz. butter, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nketchup, a little chopped lemon-peel, 1/2 teaspoonful of chopped\r\nparsley.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the oysters for 1 minute in their own liquor, and drain\r\nthem; fry them with the butter, ketchup, lemon-peel, and parsley; lay\r\nthem on a dish, and garnish with fried potatoes, toasted sippets, and\r\nparsley. This is a delicious delicacy, and is a favourite Italian dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes. _Average cost_ for this quantity, 1s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EDIBLE OYSTER.]\r\n\r\n    THE EDIBLE OYSTER:--This shell-fish is almost universally\r\n    distributed near the shores of seas in all latitudes, and they\r\n    especially abound on the coasts of France and Britain. The\r\n    coasts most celebrated, in England, for them, are those of Essex\r\n    and Suffolk. Here they are dredged up by means of a net with an\r\n    iron scraper at the mouth, that is dragged by a rope from a boat\r\n    over the beds. As soon as taken from their native beds, they are\r\n    stored in pits, formed for the purpose, furnished with sluices,\r\n    through which, at the spring tides, the water is suffered to\r\n    flow. This water, being stagnant, soon becomes green in warm\r\n    weather; and, in a few days afterwards, the oysters acquire the\r\n    same tinge, which increases their value in the market. They do\r\n    not, however, attain their perfection and become fit for sale\r\n    till the end of six or eight weeks. Oysters are not considered\r\n    proper for the table till they are about a year and a half old;\r\n    so that the brood of one spring are not to be taken for sale,\r\n    till, at least, the September twelvemonth afterwards.\r\n\r\nSCALLOPED OYSTERS.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n287. INGREDIENTS.--Oysters, say 1 pint, 1 oz. butter, flour, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of white stock, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream; pepper and\r\nsalt to taste; bread crumbs, oiled butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scald the oysters in their own liquor, take them out, beard\r\nthem, and strain the liquor free from grit. Put 1 oz. of batter into a\r\nstewpan; when melted, dredge in sufficient flour to dry it up; add the\r\nstock, cream, and strained liquor, and give one boil. Put in the oysters\r\nand seasoning; let them gradually heat through, but not boil. Have ready\r\nthe scallop-shells buttered; lay in the oysters, and as much of the\r\nliquid as they will hold; cover them over with bread crumbs, over which\r\ndrop a little oiled butter. Brown them in the oven, or before the fire,\r\nand serve quickly, and very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nPrepare the oysters as in the preceding recipe, and put them in a\r\nscallop-shell or saucer, and between each layer sprinkle over a few\r\nbread crumbs, pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg; place small pieces of\r\nbutter over, and bake before the fire in a Dutch oven. Put sufficient\r\nbread crumbs on the top to make a smooth surface, as the oysters should\r\nnot be seen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED OYSTERS.\r\n\r\n288. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of oysters, 1 oz. of butter, flour, 1/3 pint\r\nof cream; cayenne and salt to taste; 1 blade of pounded mace.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scald the oysters in their own liquor, take them out, beard\r\nthem, and strain the liquor; put the butter into a stewpan, dredge in\r\nsufficient flour to dry it up, add the oyster-liquor and mace, and stir\r\nit over a sharp fire with a wooden spoon; when it comes to a boil, add\r\nthe cream, oysters, and seasoning. Let all simmer for 1 or 2 minutes,\r\nbut not longer, or the oysters would harden. Serve on a hot dish, and\r\ngarnish with croutons, or toasted sippets of bread. A small piece of\r\nlemon-peel boiled with the oyster-liquor, and taken out before the cream\r\nis added, will be found an improvement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n    THE OYSTER AND THE SCALLOP.--The oyster is described as a\r\n    bivalve shell-fish, having the valves generally unequal. The\r\n    hinge is without teeth, but furnished with a somewhat oval\r\n    cavity, and mostly with lateral transverse grooves. From a\r\n    similarity in the structure of the hinge, oysters and scallops\r\n    have been classified as one tribe; but they differ very\r\n    essentially both in their external appearance and their habits.\r\n    Oysters adhere to rocks, or, as in two or three species, to\r\n    roots of trees on the shore; while the scallops are always\r\n    detached, and usually lurk in the sand.\r\n\r\nOYSTER PATTIES (an Entree).\r\n\r\n289. INGREDIENTS.--2 dozen oysters, 2 oz. butter, 3 tablespoonfuls of\r\ncream, a little lemon-juice, 1 blade of pounded mace; cayenne to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scald the oysters in their own liquor, beard them, and cut each\r\none into 3 pieces. Put the butter into a stewpan, dredge in sufficient\r\nflour to dry it up; add the strained oyster-liquor with the other\r\ningredients; put in the oysters, and let them heat gradually, but not\r\nboil fast. Make the patty-cases as directed for lobster patties, No.\r\n277: fill with the oyster mixture, and replace the covers.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 minutes for the oysters to simmer in the mixture.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the patty-cases, 1s. 1d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\n    THE OYSTER FISHERY.--The oyster fishery in Britain is esteemed\r\n    of so much importance, that it is regulated by a Court of\r\n    Admiralty. In the month of May, the fishermen are allowed to\r\n    take the oysters, in order to separate the spawn from the\r\n    cultch, the latter of which is thrown in again, to preserve the\r\n    bed for the future. After this month, it is felony to carry away\r\n    the cultch, and otherwise punishable to take any oyster, between\r\n    the shells of which, when closed, a shilling will rattle.\r\n\r\nTO KEEP OYSTERS.\r\n\r\n290. Put them in a tub, and cover them with salt and water. Let them\r\nremain for 12 hours, when they are to be taken out, and allowed to stand\r\nfor another 12 hours without water. If left without water every\r\nalternate 12 hours, they will be much better than if constantly kept in\r\nit. Never put the same water twice to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOYSTERS FRIED IN BATTER.\r\n\r\n291. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of oysters, 2 eggs, 1/2 pint of milk,\r\nsufficient flour to make the batter; pepper and salt to taste; when\r\nliked, a little nutmeg; hot lard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scald the oysters in their own liquor, beard them, and lay them\r\non a cloth, to drain thoroughly. Break the eggs into a basin, mix the\r\nflour with them, add the milk gradually, with nutmeg and seasoning, and\r\nput the oysters in the batter. Make some lard hot in a deep frying-pan,\r\nput in the oysters, one at a time; when done, take them up with a\r\nsharp-pointed skewer, and dish them on a napkin. Fried oysters are\r\nfrequently used for garnishing boiled fish, and then a few bread crumbs\r\nshould be added to the flour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 or 6 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 1s. 10d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 persons.\r\n\r\n    EXCELLENCE OF THE ENGLISH OYSTER.--The French assert that the\r\n    English oysters, which are esteemed the best in Europe, were\r\n    originally procured from Cancalle Bay, near St. Malo; but they\r\n    assign no proof for this. It is a fact, however, that the\r\n    oysters eaten in ancient Rome were nourished in the channel\r\n    which then parted the Isle of Thanet from England, and which has\r\n    since been filled up, and converted into meadows.\r\n\r\nBOILED PERCH.\r\n\r\n292. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of salt to each gallon of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scale the fish, take out the gills and clean it thoroughly; lay\r\nit in boiling water, salted as above, and simmer gently for 10 minutes.\r\nIf the fish is very large, longer time must be allowed. Garnish with\r\nparsley, and serve with plain melted butter, or Dutch sauce. Perch do\r\nnot preserve so good a flavour when stewed as when dressed in any other\r\nway.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Middling-sized perch, 1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to November.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Tench may be boiled the same way, and served with the same\r\nsauces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PERCH.]\r\n\r\n    THE PERCH.--This is one of the best, as it is one of the most\r\n    common, of our fresh-water fishes, and is found in nearly all\r\n    the lakes and rivers in Britain and Ireland, as well as through\r\n    the whole of Europe within the temperate zone. It is extremely\r\n    voracious, and it has the peculiarity of being gregarious, which\r\n    is contrary to the nature of all fresh-water fishes of prey. The\r\n    best season to angle for it is from the beginning of May to the\r\n    middle of July. Large numbers of this fish are bred in the\r\n    Hampton Court and Bushy Park ponds, all of which are well\r\n    supplied with running water and with plenty of food; yet they\r\n    rarely attain a large size. In the Regent's Park they are also\r\n    very numerous; but are seldom heavier than three quarters of a\r\n    pound.\r\n\r\nFRIED PERCH.\r\n\r\n293. INGREDIENTS.--Egg and bread crumbs, hot lard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scale and clean the fish, brush it over with egg, and cover\r\nwith bread crumbs. Have ready some boiling lard; put the fish in, and\r\nfry a nice brown. Serve with plain melted butter or anchovy sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to November.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Fry tench in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCH STEWED WITH WINE.\r\n\r\n294. INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of stock No. 105 and sherry, 1\r\nbay-leaf, 1 clove of garlic, a small bunch of parsley, 2 cloves, salt to\r\ntaste; thickening of butter and flour, pepper, grated nutmeg, 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of anchovy sauce.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scale the fish and take out the gills, and clean them\r\nthoroughly; lay them in a stewpan with sufficient stock and sherry just\r\nto cover them. Put in the bay-leaf, garlic, parsley, cloves, and salt,\r\nand simmer till tender. When done, take out the fish, strain the liquor,\r\nadd a thickening of butter and flour, the pepper, nutmeg, and the\r\nanchovy sauce, and stir it over the fire until somewhat reduced, when\r\npour over the fish, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to November.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED PIKE.\r\n\r\n295. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of salt to each gallon of water; a little\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scale and clean the pike, and fasten the tail in its mouth by\r\nmeans of a skewer. Lay it in cold water, and when it boils, throw in the\r\nsalt and vinegar. The time for boiling depends, of course, on the size\r\nof the fish; but a middling-sized pike will take about 1/2 an hour.\r\nServe with Dutch or anchovy sauce, and plain melted butter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--According to size, 1/2 to 1 hour.--_Average cost_. Seldom\r\nbought.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PIKE.]\r\n\r\n    THE PIKE.--This fish is, on account of its voracity, termed the\r\n    freshwater shark, and is abundant in most of the European lakes,\r\n    especially those of the northern parts. It grows to an immense\r\n    size, some attaining to the measure of eight feet, in Lapland\r\n    and Russia. The smaller lakes, of this country and Ireland, vary\r\n    in the kinds of fish they produce; some affording trout, others\r\n    pike; and so on. Where these happen to be together, however, the\r\n    trout soon becomes extinct. \"Within a short distance of\r\n    Castlebar,\" says a writer on sports, \"there is a small bog-lake\r\n    called Derreens. Ten years ago it was celebrated for its\r\n    numerous well-sized trouts. Accidentally pike effected a passage\r\n    into the lake from the Minola river, and now the trouts are\r\n    extinct, or, at least, none of them are caught or seen. Previous\r\n    to the intrusion of the pikes, half a dozen trouts would be\r\n    killed in an evening in Derreens, whose collective weight often\r\n    amounted to twenty pounds.\" As an eating fish, the pike is in\r\n    general dry.\r\n\r\nBAKED PIKE.\r\n\r\n296. INGREDIENTS.--1 or 2 pike, a nice delicate stuffing (_see_\r\nForcemeats), 1 egg, bread crumbs, 1/4 lb. butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scale the fish, take out the gills, wash, and wipe it\r\nthoroughly dry; stuff it with forcemeat, sew it up, and fasten the tail\r\nin the mouth by means of a skewer; brush it over with egg, sprinkle with\r\nbread crumbs, and baste with butter, before putting it in the oven,\r\nwhich must be well heated. When the pike is of a nice brown colour,\r\ncover it with buttered paper, as the outside would become too dry. If 2\r\nare dressed, a little variety may be made by making one of them green\r\nwith a little chopped parsley mixed with the bread crumbs. Serve anchovy\r\nor Dutch sauce, and plain melted butter with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--According to size, 1 hour, more or less.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_.--Seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Pike _à la génévese_ may be stewed in the same manner as salmon\r\n_à la génévese_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED PLAICE.\r\n\r\n297.--INGREDIENTS.--Hot lard, or clarified dripping; egg and bread\r\ncrumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--This fish is fried in the same manner as soles. Wash and wipe\r\nthem thoroughly dry, and let them remain in a cloth until it is time to\r\ndress them. Brush them over with egg, and cover with bread crumbs mixed\r\nwith a little flour. Fry of a nice brown in hot dripping or lard, and\r\ngarnish with fried parsley and cut lemon. Send them to table with\r\nshrimp-sauce and plain melted butter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 5 minutes. _Average cost_, 3d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from May to November.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, 4 plaice for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Plaice may be boiled plain, and served with melted butter.\r\nGarnish with parsley and cut lemon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED PLAICE.\r\n\r\n298. INGREDIENTS.--4 or 5 plaice, 2 onions, 1/2 oz. ground ginger, 1\r\npint of lemon-juice, 1/4 pint water, 6 eggs; cayenne to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the fish into pieces about 2 inches wide, salt them, and\r\nlet them remain 1/4 hour. Slice and fry the onions a light brown; put\r\nthem in a stewpan, on the top of which put the fish without washing, and\r\nadd the ginger, lemon-juice, and water. Cook slowly for 1/2 hour, and do\r\nnot let the fish boil, or it will break. Take it out, and when the\r\nliquor is cool, add 6 well-beaten eggs; simmer till it thickens, when\r\npour over the fish, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_ for this quantity, 1s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from May to November.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons; according to size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PLAICE.]\r\n\r\n    THE PLAICE.--This fish is found both in the Baltic and the\r\n    Mediterranean, and is also abundant on the coast of England. It\r\n    keeps well, and, like all ground-fish, is very tenacious of\r\n    life. Its flesh is inferior to that of the sole, and, as it is a\r\n    low-priced fish, it is generally bought by the poor. The best\r\n    brought to the London market are called _Dowers plaice_, from\r\n    their being caught in the Dowers, or flats, between Hastings and\r\n    Folkstone.\r\n\r\nTO BOIL PRAWNS OR SHRIMPS.\r\n\r\n299. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. salt to each gallon of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Prawns should be very red, and have no spawn under the tail;\r\nmuch depends on their freshness and the way in which they are cooked.\r\nThrow them into boiling water, salted as above, and keep them boiling\r\nfor about 7 or 8 minutes. Shrimps should be done in the same way; but\r\nless time must be allowed. It may easily be known when they are done by\r\ntheir changing colour. Care should be taken that they are not\r\nover-boiled, as they then become tasteless and indigestible.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Prawns, about 8 minutes; shrimps, about 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, prawns, 2s. per lb.; shrimps, 6d. per pint.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DRESS PRAWNS.\r\n\r\n300. Cover a dish with a large cup reversed, and over that lay a small\r\nwhite napkin. Arrange the prawns on it in the form of a pyramid, and\r\ngarnish with plenty of parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED SALMON.\r\n\r\n301. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of salt to each gallon of water,--sufficient\r\nwater to cover the fish.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scale and clean the fish, and be particular that no blood is\r\nleft inside; lay it in the fish-kettle with sufficient cold water to\r\ncover it, adding salt in the above proportion. Bring it quickly to a\r\nboil, take off all the scum, and let it simmer gently till the fish is\r\ndone, which will be when the meat separates easily from the bone.\r\nExperience alone can teach the cook to fix the time for boiling fish;\r\nbut it is especially to be remembered, that it should never be\r\nunderdressed, as then nothing is more unwholesome. Neither let it remain\r\nin the kettle after it is sufficiently cooked, as that would render it\r\ninsipid, watery, and colourless. Drain it, and if not wanted for a few\r\nminutes, keep it warm by means of warm cloths laid over it. Serve on a\r\nhot napkin, garnish with cut lemon and parsley, and send lobster or\r\nshrimp sauce, and plain melted butter to table with it. A dish of\r\ndressed cucumber usually accompanies this fish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--8 minutes to each lb. for large thick salmon; 6 minutes for\r\nthin fish. _Average cost_, in full season, 1s. 3d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to August.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, 1/2 lb., or rather less, for each person.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Cut lemon should be put on the table with this fish; and a\r\nlittle of the juice squeezed over it is considered by many persons a\r\nmost agreeable addition. Boiled peas are also, by some connoisseurs,\r\nconsidered especially adapted to be served with salmon.\r\n\r\nTO CHOOSE SALMON.--To be good, the belly should be firm and thick, which\r\nmay readily be ascertained by feeling it with the thumb and finger. The\r\ncircumstance of this fish having red gills, though given as a standing\r\nrule in most cookery-books, as a sign of its goodness, is not at all to\r\nbe relied on, as this quality can be easily given them by art.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALMON AND CAPER SAUCE.\r\n\r\n302. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of salmon, 1/4 lb. batter, 1/2 teaspoonful\r\nof chopped parsley, 1 shalot; salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Lay the salmon in a baking-dish, place pieces of butter over\r\nit, and add the other ingredients, rubbing a little of the seasoning\r\ninto the fish; baste it frequently; when done, take it out and drain for\r\na minute or two; lay it in a dish, pour caper sauce over it, and serve.\r\nSalmon dressed in this way, with tomato sauce, is very delicious.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 3d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to August.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n    THE MIGRATORY HABITS OF THE SALMON.--The instinct with which the\r\n    salmon revisits its native river, is one of the most curious\r\n    circumstances in its natural history. As the swallow returns\r\n    annually to its nest, so it returns to the same spot to deposit\r\n    its ova. This fact would seem to have been repeatedly proved. M.\r\n    De Lande fastened a copper ring round a salmon's tail, and found\r\n    that, for three successive seasons, it returned to the same\r\n    place. Dr. Bloch states that gold and silver rings have been\r\n    attached by eastern princes to salmon, to prove that a\r\n    communication existed between the Persian Gulf and the Caspian\r\n    and Northern Seas, and that the experiment succeeded.\r\n\r\nCOLLARED SALMON.\r\n\r\n303. INGREDIENTS.--A piece of salmon, say 3 lbs., a high seasoning of\r\nsalt, pounded mace, and pepper; water and vinegar, 3 bay-leaves.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Split the fish; scale, bone, and wash it thoroughly clean; wipe\r\nit, and rub in the seasoning inside and out; roll it up, and bind\r\nfirmly; lay it in a kettle, cover it with vinegar and water (1/3\r\nvinegar, in proportion to the water); add the bay-leaves and a good\r\nseasoning of salt and whole pepper, and simmer till done. Do not remove\r\nthe lid. Serve with melted butter or anchovy sauce. For preserving the\r\ncollared fish, boil up the liquor in which it was cooked, and add a\r\nlittle more vinegar. Pour over when cold.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour, or rather more.\r\n\r\n    HABITAT OF THE SALMON.--The salmon is styled by Walton the \"king\r\n    of fresh-water fish,\" and is found distributed over the north of\r\n    Europe and Asia, from Britain to Kamschatka, but is never found\r\n    in warm latitudes, nor has it ever been caught even so far south\r\n    as the Mediterranean. It lives in fresh as well as in salt\r\n    waters, depositing its spawn in the former, hundreds of miles\r\n    from the mouths of some of those rivers to which it has been\r\n    known to resort. In 1859, great efforts were made to introduce\r\n    this fish into the Australian colonies; and it is believed that\r\n    the attempt, after many difficulties, which were very skilfully\r\n    overcome, has been successful.\r\n\r\nCRIMPED SALMON.\r\n\r\n304. Salmon is frequently dressed in this way at many fashionable\r\ntables, but must be very fresh, and cut into slices 2 or 3 inches thick.\r\nLay these in cold salt and water for 1 hour; have ready some boiling\r\nwater, salted, as in recipe No. 301, and well skimmed; put in the fish,\r\nand simmer gently for 1/4 hour, or rather more; should it be very thick,\r\ngarnish the same as boiled salmon, and serve with the same sauces.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour, more or less, according to size.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Never use vinegar with salmon, as it spoils the taste and\r\ncolour of the fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SALMON.]\r\n\r\n    THE SALMON TRIBE.--This is the Abdominal fish, forming the\r\n    fourth of the orders of Linnaeus. They are distinguished from\r\n    the other fishes by having two dorsal fins, of which the\r\n    hindmost is fleshy and without rays. They have teeth both on the\r\n    tongue and in the jaws, whilst the body is covered with round\r\n    and minutely striated scales.\r\n\r\nCURRIED SALMON.\r\n\r\n305. INGREDIENTS.--Any remains of boiled salmon, 3/4 pint of strong or\r\nmedium stock (No. 105), 1 onion, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, 1\r\nteaspoonful of Harvey's sauce, 1 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, 1 oz. of\r\nbutter, the juice of 1/2 lemon, cayenne and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the onions into small pieces, and fry them of a pale\r\nbrown in the butter; add all the ingredients but the salmon, and simmer\r\ngently till the onion is tender, occasionally stirring the contents; cut\r\nthe salmon into small square pieces, carefully take away all skin and\r\nbone, lay it in the stewpan, and let it gradually heat through; but do\r\nnot allow it to boil long.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the cold fish, 9d.\r\n\r\n    GROWTH OF THE SALMON.--At the latter end of the year--some as\r\n    soon as November--salmon begin to press up the rivers as far as\r\n    they can reach, in order to deposit their spawn, which they do\r\n    in the sand or gravel, about eighteen inches deep. Here it lies\r\n    buried till the spring, when, about the latter end of March, it\r\n    begins to exclude the young, which gradually increase to four or\r\n    five inches in length, and are then termed smelts or smouts.\r\n    About the beginning of May, the river seems to be alive with\r\n    them, and there is no forming an idea of their numbers without\r\n    having seen them. A seasonable flood, however, comes, and\r\n    hurries them to the \"great deep;\" whence, about the middle of\r\n    June, they commence their return to the river again. By this\r\n    time they are twelve or sixteen inches long, and progressively\r\n    increase, both in number and size, till about the end of July,\r\n    when they have become large enough to be denominated _grilse_.\r\n    Early in August they become fewer in numbers, but of greater\r\n    size, haying advanced to a weight of from six to nine pounds.\r\n    This rapidity of growth appears surprising, and realizes the\r\n    remark of Walton, that \"the salmlet becomes a salmon in as short\r\n    a time as a gosling becomes a goose.\" Recent writers have,\r\n    however, thrown considerable doubts on this quick growth of the\r\n    salmon.\r\n\r\nSALMON CUTLETS.\r\n\r\n306. Cut the slices 1 inch thick, and season them with pepper and salt;\r\nbutter a sheet of white paper, lay each slice on a separate piece, with\r\ntheir ends twisted; broil gently over a clear fire, and serve with\r\nanchovy or caper sauce. When higher seasoning is required, add a few\r\nchopped herbs and a little spice.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 to 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nSALMON A LA GENEVESE.\r\n\r\n307. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of salmon, 2 chopped shalots, a little\r\nparsley, a small bunch of herbs, 2 bay-leaves, 2 carrots, pounded mace,\r\npepper and salt to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of Madeira, 1/2 pint of white\r\nstock (No. 107), thickening of butter and flour, 1 teaspoonful of\r\nessence of anchovies, the juice of 1 lemon, cayenne and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the bottom of a stewpan over with butter, and put in the\r\nshalots, herbs, bay-leaves, carrots, mace, and seasoning; stir them for\r\n10 minutes over a clear fire, and add the Madeira or sherry; simmer\r\ngently for 1/2 hour, and strain through a sieve over the fish, which\r\nstew in this gravy. As soon as the fish is sufficiently cooked, take\r\naway all the liquor, except a little to keep the salmon moist, and put\r\nit into another stewpan; add the stock, thicken with butter and flour,\r\nand put in the anchovies, lemon-juice, cayenne, and salt; lay the salmon\r\non a hot dish, pour over it part of the sauce, and serve the remainder\r\nin a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/4 hour. _Average cost_ for this quantity, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLED SALMON.\r\n\r\n308. INGREDIENTS.--Salmon, 1/2 oz. of whole pepper, 1/2 oz. of whole\r\nallspice, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 2 bay-leaves, equal quantities of\r\nvinegar and the liquor in which the fish was boiled.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--After the fish comes from table, lay it in a nice dish with a\r\ncover to it, as it should be excluded from the air, and take away the\r\nbone; boil the liquor and vinegar with the other ingredients for 10\r\nminutes, and let it stand to get cold; pour it over the salmon, and in\r\n12 hours this will be fit for the table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes.\r\n\r\n    TO CURE SALMON.--This process consists in splitting the fish,\r\n    rubbing it with salt, and then putting it into pickle in tubs\r\n    provided for the purpose. Here it is kept for about six weeks,\r\n    when it is taken out, pressed and packed in casks, with layers\r\n    of salt.\r\n\r\nPOTTED SALMON.\r\n\r\n309. INGREDIENTS.--Salmon; pounded mace, cloves, and pepper to taste; 3\r\nbay-leaves, 1/4 lb. butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Skin the salmon, and clean it thoroughly by wiping with a cloth\r\n(water would spoil it); cut it into square pieces, which rub with salt;\r\nlet them remain till thoroughly drained, then lay them in a dish with\r\nthe other ingredients, and bake. When quite done, drain them from the\r\ngravy, press into pots for use, and, when cold, pour over it clarified\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n    AN AVERSION IN THE SALMON.--The salmon is said to have an\r\n    aversion to anything red; hence, fishermen engaged in catching\r\n    it do not wear jackets or caps of that colour. Pontoppidan also\r\n    says, that it has an abhorrence of carrion, and if any happens\r\n    to be thrown into the places it haunts, it immediately forsakes\r\n    them. The remedy adopted for this in Norway, is to throw into\r\n    the polluted water a lighted torch. As food, salmon, when in\r\n    perfection, is one of the most delicious and nutritive of our\r\n    fish.\r\n\r\nBAKED SEA-BREAM.\r\n\r\n310. INGREDIENTS.--1 bream. Seasoning to taste of salt, pepper, and\r\ncayenne; 1/4 lb. of butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Well wash the bream, but do not remove the scales, and wipe\r\naway all moisture with a nice dry cloth. Season it inside and out with\r\nsalt, pepper, and cayenne, and lay it in a baking-dish. Place the\r\nbutter, in small pieces, upon the fish, and bake for rather more than\r\n1/2 an hour. To stuff this fish before baking, will be found a great\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 an hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SEA-BREAM.]\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This fish may be broiled over a nice clear fire, and served\r\nwith a good brown gravy or white sauce, or it may be stewed in wine.\r\n\r\n    THE SEA-BREAM.--This is an abundant fish in Cornwall, and it is\r\n    frequently found in the fish-market of Hastings during the\r\n    summer months, but it is not in much esteem.\r\n\r\n    MR. YARRELL'S RECIPE.\r\n\r\n    \"When thoroughly cleansed, the fish should be wiped dry, but\r\n    none of the scales should be taken off. In this state it should\r\n    be broiled, turning it often, and if the skin cracks, flour it a\r\n    little to keep the outer case entire. When on table, the whole\r\n    skin and scales turn off without difficulty, and the muscle\r\n    beneath, saturated in its own natural juices, which the outside\r\n    covering has retained, will be of good flavour.\"\r\n\r\nTO DRESS SHAD.\r\n\r\n311. INGREDIENTS.--1 shad, oil, pepper, and salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scale, empty and wash the fish carefully, and make two or three\r\nincisions across the back. Season it with pepper and salt, and let it\r\nremain in oil for 1/2 hour. Broil it on both sides over a clear fire,\r\nand serve with caper sauce. This fish is much esteemed by the French,\r\nand by them is considered excellent.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Nearly 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_.--Seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SHAD.]\r\n\r\n    THE SHAD.--This is a salt-water fish, but is held in little\r\n    esteem. It enters our rivers to spawn in May, and great numbers\r\n    of them are taken opposite the Isle of Dogs, in the Thames.\r\n\r\nPOTTED SHRIMPS.\r\n\r\n312. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of shelled shrimps, 1/4 lb. of fresh butter, 1\r\nblade of pounded mace, cayenne to taste; when liked, a little nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have ready a pint of picked shrimps, and put them, with the\r\nother ingredients, into a stewpan; let them heat gradually in the\r\nbutter, but do not let it boil. Pour into small pots, and when cold,\r\ncover with melted butter, and carefully exclude the air.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to soak in the butter.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERED PRAWNS OR SHRIMPS.\r\n\r\n313. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of picked prawns or shrimps, 3/4 pint of stock\r\nNo. 104, thickening of butter and flour; salt, cayenne, and nutmeg to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the prawns or shrimps, and put them in a stewpan with the\r\nstock; add a thickening of butter and flour; season, and simmer gently\r\nfor 3 minutes. Serve on a dish garnished with fried bread or toasted\r\nsippets. Cream sauce may be substituted for the gravy.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 1s. 4d.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SHRIMP.]\r\n\r\n    THE SHRIMP.--This shell-fish is smaller than the prawn, and is\r\n    greatly relished in London as a delicacy. It inhabits most of\r\n    the sandy shores of Europe, and the Isle of Wight is especially\r\n    famous for them.\r\n\r\nBOILED SKATE.\r\n\r\n314. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of salt to each gallon of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cleanse and skin the skate, lay it in a fish-kettle, with\r\nsufficient water to cover it, salted in the above proportion. Let it\r\nsimmer very gently till done; then dish it on a hot napkin, and serve\r\nwith shrimp, lobster, or caper sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--According to size, from 1/2 to 1 hour. _Average cost_, 4d. per\r\nlb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to April.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRIMPED SKATE.\r\n\r\n315. INGREDIENTS.--1/8 lb. of salt to each gallon of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clean, skin, and cut the fish into slices, which roll and tie\r\nround with string. Have ready some water highly salted, put in the fish,\r\nand boil till it is done. Drain well, remove the string, dish on a hot\r\nnapkin, and serve with the same sauces as above. Skate should never be\r\neaten out of season, as it is liable to produce diarrhoea and other\r\ndiseases. It may be dished without a napkin, and the sauce poured over.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 20 minutes. _Average cost_, 4d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to April.\r\n\r\nTO CHOOSE SKATE.--This fish should be chosen for its firmness, breadth,\r\nand thickness, and should have a creamy appearance. When crimped, it\r\nshould not be kept longer than a day or two, as all kinds of crimped\r\nfish soon become sour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THORNBACK SKATE.]\r\n\r\n    THE SKATE.--This is one of the ray tribe, and is extremely\r\n    abundant and cheap in the fishing towns of England. The flesh is\r\n    white, thick, and nourishing; but, we suppose, from its being so\r\n    plentiful, it is esteemed less than it ought to be on account of\r\n    its nutritive properties, and the ease with which it is\r\n    digested. It is much improved by crimping; in which state it is\r\n    usually sold in London. The THORNBACK differs from the true\r\n    skate by having large spines in its back, of which the other is\r\n    destitute. It is taken in great abundance during the spring and\r\n    summer months, but its flesh is not so good as it is in\r\n    November. It is, in regard to quality, inferior to that of the\r\n    true skate.\r\n\r\nSKATE WITH CAPER SAUCE (a la Francaise)\r\n\r\n316. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 slices of skate, 1/2 pint of vinegar, 2 oz. of\r\nsalt, 1/2 teaspoonful of pepper, 1 sliced onion, a small bunch of\r\nparsley, 2 bay-leaves, 2 or 3 sprigs of thyme, sufficient water to cover\r\nthe fish.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put in a fish-kettle all the above ingredients, and simmer the\r\nskate in them till tender. When it is done, skin it neatly, and pour\r\nover it some of the liquor in which it has been boiling. Drain it, put\r\nit on a hot dish, pour over it caper sauce, and send some of the latter\r\nto table in a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 4d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to April.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Skate may also be served with onion sauce, or parsley and\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL SKATE FRIED.\r\n\r\n317. INGREDIENTS.--Skate, sufficient vinegar to cover them, salt and\r\npepper to taste, 1 sliced onion, a small bunch of parsley, the juice of\r\n1/2 lemon, hot dripping.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cleanse the skate, lay them in a dish, with sufficient vinegar\r\nto cover them; add the salt, pepper, onion, parsley, and lemon-juice,\r\nand let the fish remain in this pickle for 1-1/2 hour. Then drain them\r\nwell, flour them, and fry of a nice brown, in hot dripping. They may be\r\nserved either with or without sauce. Skate is not good if dressed too\r\nfresh, unless it is crimped; it should, therefore, be kept for a day,\r\nbut not long enough to produce a disagreeable smell.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes. _Average cost_, 4d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to April.\r\n\r\n    OTHER SPECIES OF SKATE.--Besides the true skate, there are\r\n    several other species found in our seas. These are known as the\r\n    _white_ skate, the long-nosed skate, and the Homelyn ray, which\r\n    are of inferior quality, though often crimped, and sold for true\r\n    skate.\r\n\r\nTO BAKE SMELTS.\r\n\r\n318. INGREDIENTS.--12 smelts, bread crumbs, 1/4 lb. of fresh butter, 2\r\nblades of pounded mace; salt and cayenne to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash, and dry the fish thoroughly in a cloth, and arrange them\r\nnicely in a flat baking-dish. Cover them with fine bread crumbs, and\r\nplace little pieces of butter all over them. Season and bake for 15\r\nminutes. Just before serving, add a squeeze of lemon-juice, and garnish\r\nwith fried parsley and cut lemon.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour. _Average cost_, 2s. per dozen.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to May.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\nTO CHOOSE SMELTS.--When good, this fish is of a fine silvery appearance,\r\nand when alive, their backs are of a dark brown shade, which, after\r\ndeath, fades to a light fawn. They ought to have a refreshing fragrance,\r\nresembling that of a cucumber.\r\n\r\n    THE ODOUR OF THE SMELT.--This peculiarity in the smelt has been\r\n    compared, by some, to the fragrance of a cucumber, and by\r\n    others, to that of a violet. It is a very elegant fish, and\r\n    formerly abounded in the Thames. The _Atharine_, or sand smelt,\r\n    is sometimes sold for the true one; but it is an inferior fish,\r\n    being drier in the quality of its flesh. On the south coast of\r\n    England, where the true smelt is rare, it is plentiful.\r\n\r\nTO FRY SMELTS.\r\n\r\n319. INGREDIENTS.--Egg and bread crumbs, a little flour; boiling lard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Smelts should be very fresh, and not washed more than is\r\nnecessary to clean them. Dry them in a cloth, lightly flour, dip them in\r\negg, and sprinkle over with very fine bread crumbs, and put them into\r\nboiling lard. Fry of a nice pale brown, and be careful not to take off\r\nthe light roughness of the crumbs, or their beauty will be spoiled. Dry\r\nthem before the fire on a drainer, and servo with plain melted butter.\r\nThis fish is often used as a garnishing.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. per dozen.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to May.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SMELT.]\r\n\r\n    THE SMELT.--This is a delicate little fish, and is in high\r\n    esteem. Mr. Yarrell asserts that the true smelt is entirety\r\n    confined to the western and eastern coasts of Britain. It very\r\n    rarely ventures far from the shore, and is plentiful in\r\n    November, December, and January.\r\n\r\nBAKED SOLES.\r\n\r\n320. INGREDIENTS.--2 soles, 1/4 lb. of butter, egg, and bread crumbs,\r\nminced parsley, 1 glass of sherry, lemon-juice; cayenne and salt to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clean, skin, and well wash the fish, and dry them thoroughly in\r\na cloth. Brush them over with egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs mixed with\r\na little minced parsley, lay them in a large flat baking-dish, white\r\nside uppermost; or if it will not hold the two soles, they may each be\r\nlaid on a dish by itself; but they must not be put one on the top of the\r\nother. Melt the butter, and pour it over the whole, and bake for 20\r\nminutes. Take a portion of the gravy that flows from the fish, add the\r\nwine, lemon-juice, and seasoning, give it one boil, skim, pour it\r\n_under_ the fish, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. to 2s. per pair.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\nTO CHOOSE SOLES.--This fish should be both thick and firm. If the skin\r\nis difficult to be taken off, and the flesh looks grey, it is good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SOLE.]\r\n\r\n    THE SOLE.--This ranks next to the turbot in point of excellence\r\n    among our flat fish. It is abundant on the British coasts, but\r\n    those of the western shores are much superior in size to those\r\n    taken on the northern. The finest are caught in Torbay, and\r\n    frequently weigh 8 or 10 lbs. per pair. Its flesh being firm,\r\n    white, and delicate, is greatly esteemed.\r\n\r\nBOILED SOLES.\r\n\r\n321. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. salt to each gallon of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cleanse and wash the fish carefully, cut off the fins, but do\r\nnot skin it. Lay it in a fish-kettle, with sufficient cold water to\r\ncover it, salted in the above proportion. Let it gradually come to a\r\nboil, and keep it simmering for a few minutes, according to the size of\r\nthe fish. Dish it on a hot napkin after well draining it, and garnish\r\nwith parsley and cut lemon. Shrimp, or lobster sauce, and plain melted\r\nbutter, are usually sent to table with this dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--After the water boils, 7 minutes for a middling-sized sole.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. to 2s. per pair.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--1 middling-sized sole for 2 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLE OR COD PIE.\r\n\r\n322. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold boiled sole or cod, seasoning to\r\ntaste of pepper, salt, and pounded mace, 1 dozen oysters to each lb. of\r\nfish, 3 tablespoonfuls of white stock, 1 teacupful of cream thickened\r\nwith flour, puff paste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clear the fish from the bones, lay it in a pie-dish, and\r\nbetween each layer put a few oysters and a little seasoning; add the\r\nstock, and, when liked, a small quantity of butter; cover with puff\r\npaste, and bake for 1/2 hour. Boil the cream with sufficient flour to\r\nthicken it; pour in the pie, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_ for this quantity, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLES WITH CREAM SAUCE.\r\n\r\n323. INGREDIENTS.--2 soles; salt, cayenne, and pounded mace to taste;\r\nthe juice of 1/2 lemon, salt and water, 1/2 pint of cream.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Skin, wash, and fillet the soles, and divide each fillet in 2\r\npieces; lay them in cold salt and water, which bring gradually to a\r\nboil. When the water boils, take out the fish, lay it in a delicately\r\nclean stewpan, and cover with the cream. Add the seasoning, simmer very\r\ngently for ten minutes, and, just before serving, put in the lemon-juice.\r\nThe fillets may be rolled, and secured by means of a skewer; but this is\r\nnot so economical a way of dressing them, as double the quantity of cream\r\nis required.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes in the cream.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 1s. to 2s. per pair. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\nThis will be found a most delicate and delicious dish.\r\n\r\n    THE SOLE A FAVOURITE WITH THE ANCIENT GREEKS.--This fish was\r\n    much sought after by the ancient Greeks on account of its light\r\n    and nourishing qualities. The brill, the flounder, the diamond\r\n    and Dutch plaice, which, with the sole, were known under the\r\n    general name of _passeres_, were all equally esteemed, and had\r\n    generally the same qualities attributed to them.\r\n\r\nFILLETED SOLES A L'ITALIENNE.\r\n\r\n324. INGREDIENTS.--2 soles; salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste;\r\negg and bread crumbs, butter, the juice of 1 lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Skin, and carefully wash the soles, separate the meat from the\r\nbone, and divide each fillet in two pieces. Brush them over with white\r\nof egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs and seasoning, and put them in a\r\nbaking-dish. Place small pieces of butter over the whole, and bake for\r\n1/2 hour. When they are nearly done, squeeze the juice of a lemon over\r\nthem, and serve on a dish, with Italian sauce (see Sauces) poured over.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, from 1s. to 2s. per pair.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\nWHITING may be dressed in the same manner, and will be found very\r\ndelicious.\r\n\r\n    THE FLAVOUR OF THE SOLE.--This, as a matter of course, greatly\r\n    depends on the nature of the ground and bait upon which the\r\n    animal feeds. Its natural food are small crabs and shell-fish.\r\n    Its colour also depends on the colour of the ground where it\r\n    feeds; for if this be white, then the sole is called the white,\r\n    or lemon sole; but if the bottom be muddy, then it is called the\r\n    black sole. Small-sized soles, caught in shallow water on the\r\n    coasts, are the best in flavour.\r\n\r\nFRICASSEED SOLES.\r\n\r\n325. INGREDIENTS.--2 middling-sized soles, 1 small one, 1/2 teaspoonful\r\nof chopped lemon-peel, 1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley, a little grated\r\nbread; salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste; 1 egg, 2 oz. butter, 1/2 pint\r\nof good gravy, 2 tablespoonfuls of port wine, cayenne and lemon-juice to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Fry the soles of a nice brown, as directed in recipe No. 327,\r\nand drain them well from fat. Take all the meat from the small sole,\r\nchop it fine, and mix with it the lemon-peel, parsley, bread, and\r\nseasoning; work altogether, with the yolk of an egg and the butter; make\r\nthis into small balls, and fry them. Thicken the gravy with a\r\ndessert-spoonful of flour, add the port wine, cayenne, and lemon-juice;\r\nlay in the 2 soles and balls; let them simmer gently for 6 minutes;\r\nserve hot, and garnish with cut lemon.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to fry the soles.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 3s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time. _Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n    HOW SOLES ARE CAUGHT.--The instrument usually employed is a\r\n    trawl net, which is shaped like a pocket, of from sixty to\r\n    eighty feet long, and open at the mouth from thirty-two to forty\r\n    feet, and three deep. This is dragged along the ground by the\r\n    vessel, and on the art of the fisherman in its employment, in a\r\n    great measure depends the quality of the fish he catches. If,\r\n    for example, he drags the net too quickly, all that are caught\r\n    are swept rapidly to the end of the net, where they are\r\n    smothered, and sometimes destroyed. A medium has to be observed,\r\n    in order that as few as possible escape being caught in the net,\r\n    and as many as possible preserved alive in it.\r\n\r\nFRIED FILLETED SOLES.\r\n\r\n326. Soles for filleting should be large, as the flesh can be more\r\neasily separated from the bones, and there is less waste. Skin and wash\r\nthe fish, and raise the meat carefully from the bones, and divide it\r\ninto nice handsome pieces. The more usual way is to roll the fillets,\r\nafter dividing each one in two pieces, and either bind them round with\r\ntwine, or run a small skewer through them. Brush over with egg, and\r\ncover with bread crumbs; fry them as directed in the foregoing recipe,\r\nand garnish with fried parsley and cut lemon. When a pretty dish is\r\ndesired, this is by far the most elegant mode of dressing soles, as they\r\nlook much better than when fried whole. (_See_ Coloured Plate A.)\r\nInstead of rolling the fillets, they may be cut into square pieces, and\r\narranged in the shape of a pyramid on the dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 10 minutes. _Average cost_, from 1s. to 2s. per pair.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--2 large soles for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED SOLES.\r\n\r\n327. INGREDIENTS.--2 middling-sized soles, hot lard or clarified\r\ndripping, egg, and bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Skin and carefully wash the soles, and cut off the fins, wipe\r\nthem very dry, and let them remain in the cloth until it is time to\r\ndress them. Have ready some fine bread crumbs and beaten egg; dredge the\r\nsoles with a little flour, brush them over with egg, and cover with\r\nbread crumbs. Put them in a deep pan, with plenty of clarified dripping\r\nor lard (when the expense is not objected to, oil is still better)\r\nheated, so that it may neither scorch the fish nor make them sodden.\r\nWhen they are sufficiently cooked on one side, turn them carefully, and\r\nbrown them on the other: they may be considered ready when a thick smoke\r\nrises. Lift them out carefully, and lay them before the fire on a\r\nreversed sieve and soft paper, to absorb the fat. Particular attention\r\nshould be paid to this, as nothing is more disagreeable than greasy\r\nfish: this may be always avoided by dressing them in good time, and\r\nallowing a few minutes for them to get thoroughly crisp, and free from\r\ngreasy moisture. Dish them on a hot napkin, garnish with cut lemon and\r\nfried parsley, and send them to table with shrimp sauce and plain melted\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes for large soles; less time for small ones.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 1s. to 2s. per pair.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLES WITH MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n328. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 1 pint of water, 1 oz. butter, 1 oz.\r\nsalt, a little lemon-juice, 2 middling-sized soles.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cleanse the soles, but do not skin them, and lay them in a\r\nfish-kettle, with the milk, water, butter, salt, and lemon-juice. Bring\r\nthem gradually to boil, and let them simmer very gently till done, which\r\nwill be in about 7 minutes. Take them up, drain them well on a cloth,\r\nput them on a hot dish, and pour over them a good mushroom sauce. (_See_\r\nSauces.)\r\n\r\n_Time_.--After the water boils, 7 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRATS.\r\n\r\n329. Sprats should be cooked very fresh, which can be ascertained by\r\ntheir bright and sparkling eyes. Wipe them dry; fasten them in rows by a\r\nskewer run through the eyes; dredge with flour, and broil them on a\r\ngridiron over a nice clear fire. The gridiron should be rubbed with\r\nsuet. Serve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_,--3 or 4 minutes. _Average cost_, 1d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\nTO CHOOSE SPRATS.--Choose these from their silvery appearance, as the\r\nbrighter they are, so are they the fresher.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRATS FRIED IN BATTER.\r\n\r\n330. INGREDIENTS.--2 eggs, flour, bread crumbs; seasoning of salt and\r\npepper to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wipe the sprats, and dip them in a batter made of the above\r\ningredients. Fry of a nice brown, serve very hot, and garnish with fried\r\nparsley.\r\n\r\nSprats may be baked like herrings. (_See_ No. 268.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIED SPRATS.\r\n\r\n331. Dried sprats should be put into a basin, and boiling water poured\r\nover them; they may then be skinned and served, and this will be found a\r\nmuch better way than boiling them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPRAT.]\r\n\r\n    THE SPRAT.--This migratory fish, is rarely found longer than\r\n    four or five inches, and visits the shores of Britain after the\r\n    herring and other kinds of fish have taken their departure from\r\n    them. On the coasts of Suffolk, Essex, and Kent, they are very\r\n    abundant, and from 400 to 500 boats are employed in catching\r\n    them during the winter season. Besides plentifully supplying the\r\n    London market, they are frequently sold at sixpence a bushel to\r\n    farmers for manuring purposes. They enter the Thames about the\r\n    beginning of November, and leave it in March. At Yarmouth and\r\n    Gravesend they are cured like red herrings.\r\n\r\nBAKED STURGEON.\r\n\r\n332. INGREDIENTS.--1 small sturgeon, salt and pepper to taste, 1 small\r\nbunch of herbs, the juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/4 lb. of butter, 1 pint of\r\nwhite wine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_,--Cleanse the fish thoroughly, skin it, and split it along the\r\nbelly without separating it; have ready a large baking-dish, in which\r\nlay the fish, sprinkle over the seasoning and herbs very finely minced,\r\nand moisten it with the lemon-juice and wine. Place the butter in small\r\npieces over the whole of the fish, put it in the oven, and baste\r\nfrequently; brown it nicely, and serve with its own gravy.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Nearly 1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. to 1s. 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STURGEON.]\r\n\r\n    THE STURGEON.--This fish commences the sixth of Linnaean order,\r\n    and all the species are large, seldom measuring, when\r\n    full-grown, less than three or four feet in length. Its flesh is\r\n    reckoned extremely delicious, and, in the time of the emperor\r\n    Severus, was so highly valued by the ancients, that it was\r\n    brought to table by servants crowned with coronets, and preceded\r\n    by a band of music. It is an inhabitant of the Baltic, the\r\n    Mediterranean, the Caspian, and the Black Sea, and of the\r\n    Danube, the Volga, the Don, and other large rivers. It is\r\n    abundant in the rivers of North America, and is occasionally\r\n    taken in the Thames, as well as in the Eske and the Eden. It is\r\n    one of those fishes considered as royal property. It is from its\r\n    _roe_ that _caviare_, a favourite food of the Russians, is\r\n    prepared. Its flesh is delicate, firm, and white, but is rare in\r\n    the London market, where it sells for 1s. or 1s. 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n    THE STERLET is a smaller species of sturgeon, found in the\r\n    Caspian Sea and some Russian rivers. It also is greatly prized\r\n    on account of the delicacy of its flesh.\r\n\r\nROAST STURGEON.\r\n\r\n333. INGREDIENTS.--Veal stuffing, buttered paper, the tail-end of a\r\nsturgeon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cleanse the fish, bone and skin it; make a nice veal stuffing\r\n(see Forcemeats), and fill it with the part where the bones came from;\r\nroll it in buttered paper, bind it up firmly with tape, like a fillet of\r\nveal, and roast it in a Dutch oven before a clear fire. Serve with good\r\nbrown gravy, or plain melted butter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. to 1s. 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Sturgeon may be plain-boiled, and served with Dutch sauce. The\r\nfish is very firm, and requires long boiling.\r\n\r\n    ESTIMATE OF THE STURGEON BY THE ANCIENTS.--By the ancients, the\r\n    flesh of this fish was compared to the ambrosia of the\r\n    immortals. The poet Martial passes a high eulogium upon it, and\r\n    assigns it a place on the luxurious tables of the Palatine\r\n    Mount. If we may credit a modern traveller in China, the people\r\n    of that country generally entirely abstain from it, and the\r\n    sovereign of the Celestial Empire confines it to his own\r\n    kitchen, or dispenses it to only a few of his greatest\r\n    favourites.\r\n\r\nMATELOT OF TENCH.\r\n\r\n334. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of stock No. 105, 1/2 pint of port wine, 1\r\ndozen button onions, a few mushrooms, a faggot of herbs, 2 blades of\r\nmace, 1 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, thyme, 1 shalot,\r\n2 anchovies, 1 teacupful of stock No. 105, flour, 1 dozen oysters, the\r\njuice of 1/2 lemon; the number of tench, according to size.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scale and clean the tench, cut them into pieces, and lay them\r\nin a stewpan; add the stock, wine, onions, mushrooms, herbs, and mace,\r\nand simmer gently for 1/2 hour. Put into another stewpan all the\r\nremaining ingredients but the oysters and lemon-juice, and boil slowly\r\nfor 10 minutes, when add the strained liquor from the tench, and keep\r\nstirring it over the fire until somewhat reduced. Rub it through a\r\nsieve, pour it over the tench with the oysters, which must be previously\r\nscalded in their own liquor, squeeze in the lemon-juice, and serve.\r\nGarnish with croutons.\r\n\r\n_Time_. 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TENCH.]\r\n\r\n    THE TENCH.--This fish is generally found in foul and weedy\r\n    waters, and in such places as are well supplied with rushes.\r\n    They thrive best in standing waters, and are more numerous in\r\n    pools and ponds than in rivers. Those taken in the latter,\r\n    however, are preferable for the table. It does not often exceed\r\n    four or five pounds in weight, and is in England esteemed as a\r\n    delicious and wholesome food. As, however, they are sometimes\r\n    found in waters where the mud is excessively fetid, their\r\n    flavour, if cooked immediately on being caught, is often very\r\n    unpleasant; but if they are transferred into clear water, they\r\n    soon recover from the obnoxious taint.\r\n\r\nTENCH STEWED WITH WINE.\r\n\r\n335. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of stock No. 105, 1/2 pint of Madeira or\r\nsherry, salt and pepper to taste, 1 bay-leaf, thickening of butter and\r\nflour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clean and crimp the tench; carefully lay it in a stewpan with\r\nthe stock, wine, salt and pepper, and bay-leaf; let it stew gently for\r\n1/2 hour; then take it out, put it on a dish, and keep hot. Strain the\r\nliquor, and thicken it with butter and flour kneaded together, and stew\r\nfor 5 minutes. If not perfectly smooth, squeeze it through a tammy, add\r\na very little cayenne, and pour over the fish. Garnish with balls of\r\nveal forcemeat.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to June.\r\n\r\n    A SINGULAR QUALITY IN THE TENCH.--It is said that the tench is\r\n    possessed of such healing properties among the finny tribes,\r\n    that even the voracious pike spares it on this account.\r\n\r\n      The pike, fell tyrant of the liquid plain,\r\n      With ravenous waste devours his fellow train;\r\n      Yet howsoe'er with raging famine pined,\r\n      The tench he spares, a medicinal kind;\r\n      For when by wounds distress'd, or sore disease,\r\n      He courts the salutary fish for ease;\r\n      Close to his scales the kind physician glides,\r\n      And sweats a healing balsam from his sides.\r\n\r\n    In our estimation, however, this self-denial in the pike may be\r\n    attributed to a less poetical cause; namely, from the mud-loving\r\n    disposition of the tench, it is enabled to keep itself so\r\n    completely concealed at the bottom of its aqueous haunts, that\r\n    it remains secure from the attacks of its predatory neighbour.\r\n\r\nSTEWED TROUT.\r\n\r\n336. INGREDIENTS.--2 middling-sized trout, 1/2 onion cut in thin slices,\r\na little parsley, 2 cloves, 1 blade of mace, 2 bay-leaves, a little\r\nthyme, salt and pepper to taste, 1 pint of medium stock No. 105, 1 glass\r\nof port wine, thickening of butter and flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the fish very clean, and wipe it quite dry. Lay it in a\r\nstewpan, with all the ingredients but the butter and flour, and simmer\r\ngently for 1/2 hour, or rather more, should not the fish be quite done.\r\nTake it out, strain the gravy, add the thickening, and stir it over a\r\nsharp fire for 5 minutes; pour it over the trout, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--According to size, 1/2 hour or more.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_.--Seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from May to September, and fatter from the middle to the\r\nend of August than at any other time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\nTrout may be served with anchovy or caper sauce, baked in buttered\r\npaper, or fried whole like smelts. Trout dressed a la Génévese is\r\nextremely delicate; for this proceed the same as with salmon, No. 307.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TROUT.]\r\n\r\n    THE TROUT.--This fish, though esteemed by the moderns for its\r\n    delicacy, was little regarded by the ancients. Although it\r\n    abounded in the lakes of the Roman empire, it is generally\r\n    mentioned by writers only on account of the beauty of its\r\n    colours. About the end of September, they quit the deep water to\r\n    which they had retired during the hot weather, for the purpose\r\n    of spawning. This they always do on a gravelly bottom, or where\r\n    gravel and sand are mixed among stones, towards the end or by\r\n    the sides of streams. At this period they become black about the\r\n    head and body, and become soft and unwholesome. They are never\r\n    good when they are large with roe; but there are in all trout\r\n    rivers some barren female fish, which continue good throughout\r\n    the winter. In the common trout, the stomach is uncommonly\r\n    strong and muscular, shell-fish forming a portion of the food of\r\n    the animal; and it takes into its stomach gravel or small stones\r\n    in order to assist in comminuting it.\r\n\r\nBOILED TURBOT.\r\n\r\n337. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of salt to each gallon of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_--Choose a middling-sized turbot; for they are invariably the most\r\nvaluable: if very large, the meat will be tough and thready. Three or\r\nfour hours before dressing, soak the fish in salt and water to take off\r\nthe slime; then thoroughly cleanse it, and with a knife make an incision\r\ndown the middle of the back, to prevent the skin of the belly from\r\ncracking. Rub it over with lemon, and be particular not to cut off the\r\nfins. Lay the fish in a very clean turbot-kettle, with sufficient cold\r\nwater to cover it, and salt in the above proportion. Let it gradually\r\ncome to a boil, and skim very carefully; keep it gently simmering, and\r\non no account let it boil fast, as the fish would have a very unsightly\r\nappearance. When the meat separates easily from the bone, it is done;\r\nthen take it out, let it drain well, and dish it on a hot napkin. Rub a\r\nlittle lobster spawn through a sieve, sprinkle it over the fish, and\r\ngarnish with tufts of parsley and cut lemon. Lobster or shrimp sauce,\r\nand plain melted butter, should be sent to table with it. (See Coloured\r\nPlate E.)\r\n\r\n_Time_.--After the water boils, about 1/2 hour for a large turbot;\r\nmiddling size, about 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_,--large turbot, from 10s. to 12s.; middling size, from\r\n12s. to 15s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, 1 middling-sized turbot for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--An amusing anecdote is related, by Miss Edgeworth, of a bishop,\r\nwho, descending to his kitchen to superintend the dressing of a turbot,\r\nand discovering that his cook had stupidly cut off the fins, immediately\r\ncommenced sewing them on again with his own episcopal fingers. This\r\ndignitary knew the value of a turbot's gelatinous appendages.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARNISH FOR TURBOT OR OTHER LARGE FISH.\r\n\r\n338. Take the crumb of a stale loaf, cut it into small pyramids with\r\nflat tops, and on the top of each pyramid, put rather more than a\r\ntablespoonful of white of egg beaten to a stiff froth. Over this,\r\nsprinkle finely-chopped parsley and fine raspings of a dark colour.\r\nArrange these on the napkin round the fish, one green and one brown\r\nalternately.\r\n\r\nTO CHOOSE TURBOT.--See that it is thick, and of a yellowish white; for\r\nif of a bluish tint, it is not good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TURBOT.]\r\n\r\n    THE TURBOT.--This is the most esteemed of all our flat fish. The\r\n    northern parts of the English coast, and some places off the\r\n    coast of Holland, produce turbot in great abundance, and in\r\n    greater excellence than any other parts of the world. The London\r\n    market is chiefly supplied by Dutch fishermen, who bring to it\r\n    nearly 90,000 a year. The flesh is firm, white, rich, and\r\n    gelatinous, and is the better for being kept a day or two\r\n    previous to cooking it. In many parts of the country, turbot and\r\n    halibut are indiscriminately sold for each other. They are,\r\n    however, perfectly distinct; the upper parts of the former being\r\n    marked with large, unequal, and obtuse tubercles, while those of\r\n    the other are quite smooth, and covered with oblong soft scales,\r\n    which firmly adhere to the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURBOT-KETTLE.]\r\n\r\n    FISH-KETTLES are made in an oblong form, and have two handles,\r\n    with a movable bottom, pierced full of holes, on which the fish\r\n    is laid, and on which it may be lifted from the water, by means\r\n    of two long handles attached to each side of the movable bottom.\r\n    This is to prevent the liability of breaking the fish, as it\r\n    would necessarily be if it were cooked in a common saucepan. In\r\n    the list of Messrs. Richard and John Slack (see 71), the price\r\n    of two of these is set down at 10s. The turbot-kettle, as will\r\n    be seen by our cut, is made differently from ordinary\r\n    fish-kettles, it being less deep, whilst it is wider, and more\r\n    pointed at the sides; thus exactly answering to the shape of the\r\n    fish which it is intended should be boiled in it. It may be\r\n    obtained from the same manufacturers, and its price is £1.\r\n\r\nBAKED FILLETS OF TURBOT.\r\n\r\n339. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold turbot, lobster sauce left from\r\nthe preceding day, egg, and bread crumbs; cayenne and salt to taste;\r\nminced parsley, nutmeg, lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--After having cleared the fish from all skin and bone, divide it\r\ninto square pieces of an equal size; brush them over with egg, sprinkle\r\nwith bread crumbs mixed with a little minced parsley and seasoning. Lay\r\nthe fillets in a baking-dish, with sufficient butter to baste with. Bake\r\nfor 1/4 hour, and do not forget to keep them well moistened with the\r\nbutter. Put a little lemon-juice and grated nutmeg to the cold lobster\r\nsauce; make it hot, and pour over the fish, which must be well drained\r\nfrom the butter. Garnish with parsley and cut lemon.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Cold turbot thus warmed in the remains of lobster sauce will be\r\nfound much nicer than putting the fish again in water.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILLETS OF TURBOT A L'ITALIENNE.\r\n\r\n340. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold turbot, Italian sauce. (See\r\nSauces.)\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clear the fish carefully from the bone, and take away all skin,\r\nwhich gives an unpleasant flavour to the sauce. Make the sauce hot, lay\r\nin the fish to warm through, but do not let it boil. Garnish with\r\ncroutons.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n    THE ANCIENT ROMANS' ESTIMATE OF TURBOT.--As this luxurious\r\n    people compared soles to partridges, and sturgeons to peacocks,\r\n    so they found a resemblance to the turbot in the pheasant. In\r\n    the time of Domitian, it is said one was taken of such\r\n    dimensions as to require, in the imperial kitchen, a new stove\r\n    to be erected, and a new dish to be made for it, in order that\r\n    it might be cooked and served whole: not even imperial Rome\r\n    could furnish a stove or a dish large enough for the monstrous\r\n    animal. Where it was caught, we are not aware; but the turbot of\r\n    the Adriatic Sea held a high rank in the \"Eternal City.\"\r\n\r\nTURBOT A LA CREME.\r\n\r\n341. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold turbot. For sauce, 2 oz. of\r\nbutter, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream; salt, cayenne, and pounded mace to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clear away all skin and bone from the flesh of the turbot,\r\nwhich should be done when it comes from table, as it causes less waste\r\nwhen trimmed hot. Cut the flesh into nice square pieces, as equally as\r\npossible; put into a stewpan the butter, let it melt, and add the cream\r\nand seasoning; let it just simmer for one minute, but not boil. Lay in\r\nthe fish to warm, and serve it garnished with croutons or a paste\r\nborder.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The remains of cold salmon may be dressed in this way, and the\r\nabove mixture may be served in a _vol-au-vent_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURBOT AU GRATIN.\r\n\r\n342. INGREDIENTS.--Remains of cold turbot, béchamel (_see_ Sauces),\r\nbread crumbs, butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the flesh of the turbot into small dice, carefully freeing\r\nit from all skin and bone. Put them into a stewpan, and moisten with 4\r\nor 5 tablespoonfuls of béchamel. Let it get thoroughly hot, but do not\r\nallow it to boil. Spread the mixture on a dish, cover with finely-grated\r\nbread crumbs, and place small pieces of butter over the top. Brown it in\r\nthe oven, or with a salamander.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED WHITING.\r\n\r\n343. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of salt to each gallon of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cleanse the fish, but do not skin them; lay them in a\r\nfish-kettle, with sufficient cold water to cover them, and salt in the\r\nabove proportion. Bring them gradually to a boil, and simmer gently for\r\nabout 5 minutes, or rather more should the fish be very large. Dish them\r\non a hot napkin, and garnish with tufts of parsley. Serve with anchovy\r\nor caper sauce, and plain melted butter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--After the water boils, 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for small whitings, 4d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but best from October to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, 1 small whiting for each person.\r\n\r\nTo CHOOSE WHITING.--Choose for the firmness of its flesh and the silvery\r\nhue of its appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WHITING.]\r\n\r\n    The Whiting.--This fish forms a light, tender, and delicate\r\n    food, easy of digestion. It appears in our seas in the spring,\r\n    within three miles of the shores, where it arrives in large\r\n    shoals to deposit its spawn. It is caught by line, and is\r\n    usually between ten and twelve inches long, and seldom exceeding\r\n    a pound and a half in weight. On the edge of the Dogger Bank,\r\n    however, it has been caught so heavy as to weigh from three to\r\n    seven or eight pounds. When less than six inches long, it is not\r\n    allowed to be caught.\r\n\r\nBROILED WHITING.\r\n\r\n344. INGREDIENTS.--Salt and water, flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the whiting in salt and water, wipe them thoroughly, and\r\nlet them remain in the cloth to absorb all moisture. Flour them well,\r\nand broil over a very clear fire. Serve with _maître d'hôtel_ sauce, or\r\nplain melted butter (_see_ Sauces). Be careful to preserve the liver, as\r\nby some it is considered very delicate.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes for a small whiting. _Average cost_, 4d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but best from October to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, 1 small whiting for each person.\r\n\r\nBuckhorn.--Whitings caught in Cornwall are salted and dried, and in\r\nwinter taken to the markets, and sold under the singular name of\r\n\"Buckhorn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED WHITING.\r\n\r\n345. INGREDIENTS.--Egg and bread crumbs, a little flour, hot lard or\r\nclarified dripping.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take off the skin, clean, and thoroughly wipe the fish free\r\nfrom all moisture, as this is most essential, in order that the egg and\r\nbread crumbs may properly adhere. Fasten the tail in the mouth by means\r\nof a small skewer, brush the fish over with egg, dredge with a little\r\nflour, and cover with bread crumbs. Fry them in hot lard or clarified\r\ndripping of a nice colour, and serve them on a napkin, garnished with\r\nfried parsley. (See Coloured Plate D.) Send them to table with shrimp\r\nsauce and plain melted butter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 6 minutes. Average cost, 4d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but best from October to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, 1 small whiting for each person.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Large whitings may be filleted, rolled, and served as fried\r\nfilleted soles (_see_ Coloured Plato A). Small fried whitings are\r\nfrequently used for garnishing large boiled fish, such as turbot, cod,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITING AU GRATIN, or BAKED WHITING.\r\n\r\n346. INGREDIENTS.--4 whiting, butter, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley,\r\na few chopped mushrooms when obtainable; pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg\r\nto taste; butter, 2 glasses of sherry or Madeira, bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Grease the bottom of a baking-dish with butter, and over it,\r\nstrew some minced parsley and mushrooms. Scale, empty, and wash the\r\nwhitings, and wipe them thoroughly dry, carefully preserving the livers.\r\nLay them in the dish, sprinkle them with bread crumbs and seasoning,\r\nadding a little grated nutmeg, and also a little more minced parsley and\r\nmushrooms. Place small pieces of butter over the whiting, moisten with\r\nthe wine, and bake for 20 minutes in a hot oven. If there should be too\r\nmuch sauce, reduce it by boiling over a sharp fire for a few minutes,\r\nand pour under the fish. Serve with a cut lemon, and no other sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.---20 minutes. _Average cost_, 4d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but best from October to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--This quantity for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITING AUX FINE HERBES.\r\n\r\n347. INGREDIENTS.-1 bunch of sweet herbs chopped very fine; butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clean and skin the fish, fasten the tails in the mouths; and lay\r\nthem in a baking-dish. Mince the herbs very fine, strew them over the\r\nfish, and place small pieces of butter over; cover with another dish,\r\nand let them simmer in a Dutch oven for 1/4 hour or 20 minutes. Turn the\r\nfish once or twice, and serve with the sauce poured over.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour or 20 minutes. _Average cost_, 4d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but best from October to March.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, 1 small whiting for each person.\r\n\r\n    THE WHITING POUT, AND POLLACK.--About the mouth of the Thames,\r\n    and generally all round the English coasts, as well as in the\r\n    northern seas, the pout is plentiful. It bears a striking\r\n    resemblance to the whiting, and is esteemed as an excellent\r\n    fish.--The _pollack_ is also taken all round our coasts, and\r\n    likewise bears a striking resemblance to the whiting; indeed, it\r\n    is sometimes mistaken by the inexperienced for that fish; its\r\n    flesh being considered by many equally delicate.\r\n\r\nTO DRESS WHITEBAIT.\r\n\r\n348. INGREDIENTS.--A little flour, hot lard, seasoning of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--This fish should be put into iced water as soon as bought,\r\nunless they are cooked immediately. Drain them from the water in a\r\ncolander, and have ready a nice clean dry cloth, over which put 2 good\r\nhandfuls of flour. Toss in the whitebait, shake them lightly in the\r\ncloth, and put them in a wicker sieve to take away the superfluous\r\nflour. Throw them into a pan of boiling lard, very few at a time, and\r\nlet them fry till of a whitey-brown colour. Directly they are done, they\r\nmust he taken out, and laid before the fire for a minute or two on a\r\nsieve reversed, covered with blotting-paper to absorb the fat. Dish them\r\non a hot napkin, arrange the fish very high in the centre, and sprinkle\r\na little salt over the whole.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable _from April to August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITEBAIT.]\r\n\r\n    WHITEBAIT.--This highly-esteemed little fish appears in\r\n    innumerable multitudes in the river Thames, near Greenwich and\r\n    Blackwall, during the month of July, when it forms, served with\r\n    lemon and brown bread and butter, a tempting dish to vast\r\n    numbers of Londoners, who flock to the various taverns of these\r\n    places, in order to gratify their appetites. The fish has been\r\n    supposed be the fry of the shad, the sprat, the smelt, or the\r\n    bleak. Mr. Yarrell, however, maintains that it is a species in\r\n    itself, distinct from every other fish. When fried with flour,\r\n    it is esteemed a great delicacy. The ministers of the Crown have\r\n    had a custom, for many years, of having a \"whitebait dinner\"\r\n    just before the close of the session. It is invariably the\r\n    precursor of the prorogation of Parliament, and the repast is\r\n    provided by the proprietor of the \"Trafalgar,\" Greenwich.\r\n\r\nFISH PIE, WITH TENCH AND EELS.\r\n\r\n349. INGREDIENTS.--2 tench, 2 eels, 2 onions, a faggot of herbs, 4\r\nblades of mace, 3 anchovies, 1 pint of water, pepper and salt to taste,\r\n1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley, the yolks of 6 hard-boiled eggs, puff\r\npaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clean and bone the tench, skin and bone the eels, and cut them\r\ninto pieces 2 inches long, and leave the sides of the tench whole. Put\r\nthe bones into a stewpan with the onions, herbs, mace, anchovies, water,\r\nand seasoning, and let them simmer gently for 1 hour. Strain it off, put\r\nit to cool, and skim off all the fat. Lay the tench and eels in a\r\npie-dish, and between each layer put seasoning, chopped parsley, and\r\nhard-boiled eggs; pour in part of the strained liquor, cover in with\r\npuff paste, and bake for 1/2 hour or rather more. The oven should be\r\nrather quick, and when done, heat the remainder of the liquor, which\r\npour into the pie.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to bake, or rather more if the oven is slow.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH SCALLOP.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n350. INGREDIENTS.--Remains of cold fish of any sort, 1/2 pint of cream,\r\n1/2 tablespoonful of anchovy sauce, 1/2 teaspoonful of made mustard,\r\nditto of walnut ketchup, pepper and salt to taste (the above quantities\r\nare for 1/2 lb. of fish when picked); bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a stewpan, carefully picking the\r\nfish from the bones; set it on the fire, let it remain till nearly hot,\r\noccasionally stir the contents, but do not allow it to boil. When done,\r\nput the fish into a deep dish or scallop shell, with a good quantity of\r\nbread crumbs; place small pieces of butter on the top, set in a Dutch\r\noven before the fire to brown, or use a salamander.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the cold fish, 10d.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n351. INGREDIENTS.--Any cold fish, 1 egg, milk, 1 large blade of pounded\r\nmace, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, pepper\r\nand salt to taste, bread crumbs, butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the fish carefully from the bones, and moisten with milk\r\nand the egg; add the other ingredients, and place in a deep dish or\r\nscallop shells; cover with bread crumbs, butter the top, and brown\r\nbefore the fire; when quite hot, serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes. _Average cost_, exclusive of the cold fish, 4d.\r\n\r\nWATER SOUCHY.\r\n\r\n352. Perch, tench, soles, eels, and flounders are considered the best\r\nfish for this dish. For the souchy, put some water into a stewpan with a\r\nbunch of chopped parsley, some roots, and sufficient salt to make it\r\nbrackish. Let these simmer for 1 hour, and then stew the fish in this\r\nwater. When they are done, take them out to drain, have ready some\r\nfinely-chopped parsley, and a few roots cut into slices of about one\r\ninch thick and an inch in length. Put the fish in a tureen or deep dish,\r\nstrain the liquor over them, and add the minced parsley and roots. Serve\r\nwith brown bread and butter.\r\n\r\n353.

The old\r\nLatin proverb, however, _de gustibus non disputandum_, and the more\r\nmodern Spanish one, _sobre los gustos no hai disputa_, declare, with\r\nequal force, that where _taste_ is concerned, no decision can be arrived\r\nat. Each person's palate may be differently affected--pleased or\r\ndispleased; and there is no standard by which to judge why a red mullet,\r\na sole, or a turbot, should be better or worse than a salmon, trout,\r\npike, or a tiny tench.\r\n\r\nFish, as we have explained, is less nourishing than meat; for it is\r\nlighter in weight, size for size, and contains no ozmazome (_see_ No.\r\n100). Shell-fish, oysters particularly, furnish but little nutriment;\r\nand this is the reason why so many of the latter can be eaten without\r\ninjury to the system.\r\n\r\nIn Brillat Savarin's [Footnote: Brillat Savarin was a French lawyer and\r\njudge of considerable eminence and great talents, and wrote, under the\r\nabove title, a book on gastronomy, full of instructive information,\r\nenlivened with a fund of pleasantly-told anecdote.] clever and amusing\r\nvolume, \"The Physiology of Taste,\" he says, that towards the end of the\r\neighteenth century it was a most common thing for a well-arranged\r\nentertainment in Paris to commence with oysters, and that many guests\r\nwere not contented without swallowing twelve dozen. Being anxious to\r\nknow the weight of this advanced-guard, he ascertained that a dozen\r\noysters, fluid included, weighed 4 ounces,--thus, the twelve dozen would\r\nweigh about 3 lbs.; and there can be no doubt, that the same persons who\r\nmade no worse a dinner on account of having partaken of the oysters,\r\nwould have been completely satisfied if they had eaten the same weight\r\nof chicken or mutton. An anecdote, perfectly well authenticated, is\r\nnarrated of a French gentleman (M. Laperte), residing at Versailles, who\r\nwas extravagantly fond of oysters, declaring he never had enough.\r\nSavarin resolved to procure him the satisfaction, and gave him an\r\ninvitation to dinner, which was duly accepted. The guest arrived, and\r\nhis host kept company with him in swallowing the delicious bivalves up\r\nto the tenth dozen, when, exhausted, he gave up, and let M. Laperte go\r\non alone. This gentleman managed to eat thirty-two dozen within an hour,\r\nand would doubtless have got through more, but the person who opened\r\nthem is described as not being very skilful. In the interim Savarin was\r\nidle, and at length, tired with his painful state of inaction, he said\r\nto Laperte, whilst the latter was still in full career, \"Mon cher, you\r\nwill not eat as many oysters to-day as you meant; let us dine.\" They\r\ndined, and the insatiable oyster-eater acted at the repast as if he had\r\nfasted for a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH CARVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING FISH.\r\n\r\nIn carving fish, care should be taken to help it in perfect flakes, as,\r\nif these are broken, the beauty of the fish is lost. The carver should\r\nbe acquainted, too, with the choicest parts and morsels; and to give\r\neach guest an equal share of these _titbits_ should be his maxim. Steel\r\nknives and forks should on no account be used in helping fish, as these\r\nare liable to impart to it a very disagreeable flavour. Where silver\r\nfish-carvers are considered too dear to be bought, good electro-plated\r\nones answer very well, and are inexpensive. The prices set down for them\r\nby Messrs. Slack, of the Strand, are from a guinea upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOD'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS.\r\n\r\n(For recipe, see No. 232; and for mode of serving, Coloured Plate C.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFirst run the knife along the centre of the side of the fish, namely,\r\nfrom _d_ to _b_, down to the bone; then carve it in unbroken slices\r\ndownwards from _d_ to _e_, or upwards from _d_ to _c_, as shown in the\r\nengraving. The carver should ask the guests if they would like a portion\r\nof the roe and liver.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Of this fish, the parts about the backbone and shoulders are\r\nthe firmest, and most esteemed by connoisseurs. The sound, which lines\r\nthe fish beneath the backbone, is considered a delicacy, as are also the\r\ngelatinous parts about the head and neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALMON.\r\n\r\n(For recipe, see No. 301; and for mode of dressing, Coloured Plate B.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFirst run the knife quite down to the bone, along the side of the fish,\r\nfrom _a_ to _b_, and also from _c_ to _d_. Then help the thick part\r\nlengthwise, that is, in the direction of the lines from _a_ to _b_; and\r\nthe thin part breadthwise, that is, in the direction of the lines from\r\n_e_ to _f_, as shown in the engraving. A slice of the thick part should\r\nalways be accompanied by a smaller piece of the thin from the belly,\r\nwhere lies the fat of the fish.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Many persons, in carving salmon, make the mistake of slicing\r\nthe thick part of this fish in the opposite direction to that we have\r\nstated; and thus, by the breaking of the flakes, the beauty of its\r\nappearance is destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED OR FRIED SOLE.\r\n\r\n(For recipes, see Nos. 321 and 327.)\r\n\r\nThe usual way of helping this fish is to cut it quite through, bone and\r\nall, distributing it in nice and not too large pieces. A\r\nmoderately-sized sole will be sufficient for three slices; namely, the\r\nhead, middle, and tail. The guests should be asked which of these they\r\nprefer. A small one will only give two slices. If the sole is very\r\nlarge, the upper side may be raised from the bone, and then divided into\r\npieces; and the under side afterwards served in the same way.\r\n\r\nIn helping FILLETED SOLES, one fillet is given to each person. (For mode\r\nof serving, see Coloured Plate A.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTURBOT.\r\n\r\n(For recipe, see No. 337; and for mode of serving, Coloured Plate E.)\r\n\r\nFirst run the fish-slice down the thickest part of the fish, quite\r\nthrough to the bone, from _a_ to _b_, and then cut handsome and regular\r\nslices in the direction of the lines downwards, from _c_ to _e_, and\r\nupwards from _c_ to _d_, as shown in the engraving. When the carver has\r\nremoved all the meat from the upper side of the fish, the backbone\r\nshould be raised, put on one side of the dish, and the under side helped\r\nas the upper.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BRILL and JOHN DORY are carved in the same manner as a Turbot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The thick parts of the middle of the back are the best slices\r\nin a turbot; and the rich gelatinous skin covering the fish, as well as\r\na little of the thick part of the fins, are dainty morsels, and should\r\nbe placed on each plate.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITING, &c.\r\n\r\nWhiting, pike, haddock, and other fish, when of a sufficiently large\r\nsize, may be carved in the same manner as salmon. When small, they may\r\nbe cut through, bone and all, and helped in nice pieces, a\r\nmiddling-sized whiting serving for two slices.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The THICK part of the EEL is reckoned the best; and this holds\r\ngood of all flat fish.\r\n\r\nThe TAIL of the LOBSTER is the prime part, and next to that the CLAWS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISH CARVERS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSAUCES, PICKLES, GRAVIES, AND FORCEMEATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS.\r\n\r\n354. AN ANECDOTE IS TOLD of the prince de Soubise, who, intending to\r\ngive an entertainment, asked for the bill of fare. His _chef_ came,\r\npresenting a list adorned with vignettes, and the first article of\r\nwhich, that met the prince's eye, was \"fifty hams.\" \"Bertrand,\" said the\r\nprince, \"I think you must be extravagant; Fifty hams! do you intend to\r\nfeast my whole regiment?\" \"No, Prince, there will be but one on the\r\ntable, and the surplus I need for my Espagnole, blondes, garnitures,\r\n&c.\" \"Bertrand, you are robbing me: this item will not do.\"\r\n\"Monseigneur,\" said the _artiste_, \"you do not appreciate me. Give me\r\nthe order, and I will put those fifty hams in a crystal flask no longer\r\nthan my thumb.\" The prince smiled, and the hams were passed. This was\r\nall very well for the prince de Soubise; but as we do not write for\r\nprinces and nobles alone, but that our British sisters may make the best\r\ndishes out of the least expensive ingredients, we will also pass the\r\nhams, and give a few general directions concerning Sauces, &c.\r\n\r\n355. THE PREPARATION AND APPEARANCE OF SAUCES AND GRAVIES are of the\r\nhighest consequence, and in nothing does the talent and taste of the\r\ncook more display itself. Their special adaptability to the various\r\nviands they are to accompany cannot be too much studied, in order that\r\nthey may harmonize and blend with them as perfectly, so to speak, as\r\ndoes a pianoforte accompaniment with the voice of the singer.\r\n\r\n356. THE GENERAL BASIS OF MOST GRAVIES and some sauces is the same stock\r\nas that used for soups (_see_ Nos. 104, 105, 106, and 107); and, by the\r\nemployment of these, with, perhaps, an additional slice of ham, a little\r\nspice, a few herbs, and a slight flavouring from some cold sauce or\r\nketchup, very nice gravies may be made for a very small expenditure. A\r\nmilt (either of a bullock or sheep), the shank-end of mutton that has\r\nalready been dressed, and the necks and feet of poultry, may all be\r\nadvantageously used for gravy, where much is not required. It may, then,\r\nbe established as a rule, that there exists no necessity for good\r\ngravies to be expensive, and that there is no occasion, as many would\r\nhave the world believe, to buy ever so many pounds of fresh meat, in\r\norder to furnish an ever so little quantity of gravy.\r\n\r\n357. BROWN SAUCES, generally speaking, should scarcely be so thick as\r\nwhite sauces; and it is well to bear in mind, that all those which are\r\nintended to mask the various dishes of poultry or meat, should be of a\r\nsufficient consistency to slightly adhere to the fowls or joints over\r\nwhich they are poured. For browning and thickening sauces, &c., browned\r\nflour may be properly employed.\r\n\r\n358. SAUCES SHOULD POSSESS A DECIDED CHARACTER; and whether sharp or\r\nsweet, savoury or plain, they should carry out their names in a distinct\r\nmanner, although, of course, not so much flavoured as to make them too\r\npiquant on the one hand, or too mawkish on the other.\r\n\r\n359. GRAVIES AND SAUCES SHOULD BE SENT TO TABLE VERY HOT; and there is\r\nall the more necessity for the cook to see to this point, as, from their\r\nbeing usually served in small quantities, they are more liable to cool\r\nquickly than if they were in a larger body. Those sauces, of which cream\r\nor eggs form a component part, should be well stirred, as soon as these\r\ningredients are added to them, and must never be allowed to boil; as, in\r\nthat case, they would instantly curdle.\r\n\r\n360. ALTHOUGH PICKLES MAY BE PURCHASED at shops at as low a rate as they\r\ncan usually be made for at home, or perhaps even for less, yet we would\r\nadvise all housewives, who have sufficient time and convenience, to\r\nprepare their own. The only general rules, perhaps, worth stating\r\nhere,--as in the recipes all necessary details will be explained, are,\r\nthat the vegetables and fruits used should be sound, and not over ripe,\r\nand that the very best vinegar should be employed.\r\n\r\n361. FOR FORCEMEATS, SPECIAL ATTENTION IS NECESSARY. The points which\r\ncooks should, in this branch of cookery, more particularly observe, are\r\nthe thorough chopping of the suet, the complete mincing of the herbs,\r\nthe careful grating of the bread-crumbs, and the perfect mixing of the\r\nwhole. These are the three principal ingredients of forcemeats, and they\r\ncan scarcely be cut too small, as nothing like a lump or fibre should be\r\nanywhere perceptible. To conclude, the flavour of no one spice or herb\r\nshould be permitted to predominate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUCES, PICKLES, GRAVIES, AND FORCEMEATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nANCHOVY SAUCE FOR FISH.\r\n\r\n362. INGREDIENTS.--4 anchovies, 1 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint of melted\r\nbutter, cayenne to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Bone the anchovies, and pound them in a mortar to a paste, with\r\n1 oz. of butter. Make the melted butter hot, stir in the pounded\r\nanchovies and cayenne; simmer for 3 or 4 minutes; and if liked, add a\r\nsqueeze of lemon-juice. A more general and expeditious way of making\r\nthis sauce is to stir in 1-1/2 tablespoonfuls of anchovy essence to 1/2\r\npint of melted butter, and to add seasoning to taste. Boil the whole up\r\nfor 1 minute, and serve hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes. _Average cost_, 5d. for 1/2 pint.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, this quantity, for a brill, small turbot, 3 or 4 soles,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nANCHOVY BUTTER (_see_ No. 227).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAPISCUM.]\r\n\r\n    CAYENNE.--This is the most acrid and stimulating spice with\r\n    which we are acquainted. It is a powder prepared from several\r\n    varieties of the capsicum annual East-India plants, of which\r\n    there are three so far naturalized in this country as to be able\r\n    to grow in the open air: these are the Guinea, the Cherry, and\r\n    the Bell pepper. All the pods of these are extremely pungent to\r\n    the taste, and in the green state are used by us as a pickle.\r\n    When ripe, they are ground into cayenne pepper, and sold as a\r\n    condiment. The best of this, however, is made in the West\r\n    Indies, from what is called the _Bird_ pepper, on account of\r\n    hens and turkeys being extremely partial to it. It is imported\r\n    ready for use. Of the capiscum species of plants there are five;\r\n    but the principal are,--1. _Capsicum annuum_, the common\r\n    long-podded capsicum, which is cultivated in our gardens, and of\r\n    which there are two varieties, one with red, and another with\r\n    yellow fruit. 2. _Capsicum baccatum_, or bird pepper, which\r\n    rises with a shrubby stalk four or five feet high, with its\r\n    berries growing at the division of the branches: this is small,\r\n    oval-shaped, and of a bright-red colour, from which, as we have\r\n    said, the best cayenne is made. 3. _Capsicum grossum_, the\r\n    bell-pepper: the fruit of this is red, and is the only kind fit\r\n    for pickling.\r\n\r\nAPPLE SAUCE FOR GEESE, PORK, &c.\r\n\r\n363. INGREDIENTS.--6 good-sized apples, sifted sugar to taste, a piece\r\nof butter the size of a walnut, water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare, core, and quarter the apples, and throw them into cold\r\nwater to preserve their whiteness. Put them in a saucepan, with\r\nsufficient water to moisten them, and boil till soft enough to pulp.\r\nBeat them up, adding sugar to taste, and a small piece of butter This\r\nquantity is sufficient for a good-sized tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--According to the apples, about 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, this quantity, for a goose or couple of ducks.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN APPLE SAUCE.\r\n\r\n364. INGREDIENTS.--6 good-sized apples, 1/2 pint of brown gravy, cayenne\r\nto taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_. Put the gravy in a stewpan, and add the apples, after having\r\npared, cored, and quartered them. Let them simmer gently till tender;\r\nbeat them to a pulp, and season with cayenne. This sauce is preferred by\r\nmany to the preceding.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--According to the apples, about 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS SAUCE.\r\n\r\n365. INGREDIENTS.--1 bunch of green asparagus, salt, 1 oz. of fresh\r\nbutter, 1 small bunch of parsley, 3 or 4 green onions, 1 large lump of\r\nsugar, 4 tablespoonfuls of sauce tournée.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Break the asparagus in the tender part, wash well, and put them\r\ninto boiling salt and water to render them green. When they are tender,\r\ntake them out, and put them into cold water; drain them on a cloth till\r\nall moisture is absorbed from them. Put the butter in a stewpan, with\r\nthe parsley and onions; lay in the asparagus, and fry the whole over a\r\nsharp fire for 5 minutes. Add salt, the sugar and sauce tournée, and\r\nsimmer for another 5 minutes. Rub all through a tammy, and if not a very\r\ngood colour, use a little spinach green. This sauce should be rather\r\nsweet.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 40 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 1s. 4d.\r\n\r\n\r\nASPIC, or ORNAMENTAL SAVOURY JELLY.\r\n\r\n366. INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs. of knuckle of veal, 1 cow-heel, 3 or 4 slices\r\nof ham, any poultry trimmings, 2 carrots, 1 onion, 1 faggot of savoury\r\nherbs, 1 glass of sherry, 3 quarts of water; seasoning to taste of salt\r\nand whole white pepper; 3 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Lay the ham on the bottom of a stewpan, cut up the veal and\r\ncow-heel into small pieces, and lay them on the ham; add the poultry\r\ntrimmings, vegetables, herbs, sherry, and water, and let the whole\r\nsimmer very gently for 4 hours, carefully taking away all scum that may\r\nrise to the surface; strain through a fine sieve, and pour into an\r\nearthen pan to get cold. Have ready a clean stewpan, put in the jelly,\r\nand be particular to leave the sediment behind, or it will not be clear.\r\nAdd the whites of 3 eggs, with salt and pepper, to clarify; keep\r\nstirring over the fire, till the whole becomes very white; then draw it\r\nto the side, and let it stand till clear. When this is the case, strain\r\nit through a cloth or jelly-bag, and use it for moulding poultry, etc.\r\n(See Explanation of French Terms, page 44.) Tarragon vinegar may be\r\nadded to give an additional flavour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 4-1/2 hours. _Average cost_ for this quantity, 4s.\r\n\r\n    WHITE PEPPER.--This is the produce of the same plant as that\r\n    which produces the black pepper, from which it is manufactured\r\n    by steeping this in lime and water, and rubbing it between the\r\n    hands till the coats come off. The best berries only will bear\r\n    this operation; hence the superior qualities of white pepper\r\n    fetch a higher price than those of the other. It is less acrid\r\n    than the black, and is much prized among the Chinese. It is\r\n    sometimes adulterated with rice-flour, as the black is with\r\n    burnt bread. The berries of the pepper-plant grow in spikes of\r\n    from twenty to thirty, and are, when ripe, of a bright-red\r\n    colour. After being gathered, which is done when they are green,\r\n    they are spread out in the sun, where they dry and become black\r\n    and shrivelled, when they are ready for being prepared for the\r\n    market.\r\n\r\nBECHAMEL, or FRENCH WHITE SAUCE.\r\n\r\n367. INGREDIENTS.--1 small bunch of parsley, 2 cloves, 1/2 bay-leaf, 1\r\nsmall faggot of savoury herbs, salt to taste; 3 or 4 mushrooms, when\r\nobtainable; 2 pints of white stock, 1 pint of cream, 1 tablespoonful of\r\narrowroot.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the stock into a stewpan, with the parsley, cloves,\r\nbay-leaf, herbs, and mushrooms; add a seasoning of salt, but no pepper,\r\nas that would give the sauce a dusty appearance, and should be avoided.\r\nWhen it has boiled long enough to extract the flavour of the herbs,\r\netc., strain it, and boil it up quickly again, until it is nearly\r\nhalf-reduced. Now mix the arrowroot smoothly with the cream, and let it\r\nsimmer very gently for 5 minutes over a slow fire; pour to it the\r\nreduced stock, and continue to simmer slowly for 10 minutes, if the\r\nsauce be thick. If, on the contrary, it be too thin, it must be stirred\r\nover a sharp fire till it thickens. This is the foundation of many kinds\r\nof sauces, especially white sauces. Always make it thick, as you can\r\neasily thin it with cream, milk, or white stock.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. per pint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLOVE.]\r\n\r\n    THE CLOVE.--The clove-tree is a native of the Molucca Islands,\r\n    particularly Amboyna, and attains the height of a laurel-tree,\r\n    and no verdure is ever seen under it. From the extremities of\r\n    the branches quantities of flowers grow, first white; then they\r\n    become green, and next red and hard, when they have arrived at\r\n    their clove state. When they become dry, they assume a yellowish\r\n    hue, which subsequently changes into a dark brown. As an\r\n    aromatic, the clove is highly stimulating, and yields an\r\n    abundance of oil. There are several varieties of the clove; the\r\n    best is called the _royal clove_, which is scarce, and which is\r\n    blacker and smaller than the other kinds. It is a curious fact,\r\n    that the flowers, when fully developed, are quite inodorous, and\r\n    that the real fruit is not in the least aromatic. The form is\r\n    that of a nail, having a globular head, formed of the four\r\n    petals of the corolla, and four leaves of the calyx not\r\n    expanded, with a nearly cylindrical germen, scarcely an inch in\r\n    length, situate below.\r\n\r\nBECHAMEL MAIGRE, or WITHOUT MEAT.\r\n\r\n368. INGREDIENTS.--2 onions, 1 blade of mace, mushroom trimmings, a\r\nsmall bunch of parsley, 1 oz. of butter, flour, 1/2 pint of water, 1\r\npint of milk, salt, the juice of 1 lemon, 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put in a stewpan the milk, and 1/2 pint of water, with the\r\nonions, mace, mushrooms, parsley, and salt. Let these simmer gently for\r\n20 minutes. In the mean time, rub on a plate 1 oz. of flour and butter;\r\nput it to the liquor, and stir it well till it boils up; then place it\r\nby the side of the fire, and continue stirring until it is perfectly\r\nsmooth. Now strain it through a sieve into a basin, after which put it\r\nback in the stewpan, and add the lemon-juice. Beat up the yolks of the\r\neggs with about 4 dessertspoonfuls of milk; strain this to the sauce,\r\nkeep stirring it over the fire, but do not let it boil, lest it curdle.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 5d. per pint.\r\n\r\nThis is a good sauce to pour over boiled fowls when they are a bad\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLED BEETROOT.\r\n\r\n369. INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient vinegar to cover the beets, 2 oz. of whole\r\npepper, 2 oz. of allspice to each gallon of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the beets free from dirt, and be very careful not to prick\r\nthe outside skin, or they would lose their beautiful colour. Put them\r\ninto boiling water, let them simmer gently, and when about three parts\r\ndone, which will be in 1-1/2 hour, take them out and let them cool. Boil\r\nthe vinegar with pepper and allspice, in the above proportion, for ten\r\nminutes, and when cold, pour it on the beets, which must be peeled and\r\ncut into slices about 1/2 inch thick. Cover with bladder to exclude the\r\nair, and in a week they will be fit for use.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3s. per gallon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK PEPPER.]\r\n\r\n    BLACK PEPPER.--This well-known aromatic spice is the fruit of a\r\n    species of climbing vine, and is a native of the East Indies,\r\n    and is extensively cultivated in Malabar and the eastern islands\r\n    of Borneo, Sumatra, and Java, and others in the same latitude.\r\n    It was formerly confined to these countries, but it has now been\r\n    introduced to Cayenne. It is generally employed as a condiment;\r\n    but it should never be forgotten, that, even in small\r\n    quantities, it produces detrimental effects on inflammatory\r\n    constitutions. Dr. Paris, in his work on Diet, says, \"Foreign\r\n    spices were not intended by Nature for the inhabitants of\r\n    temperate climes; they are heating, and highly stimulant. I am,\r\n    however, not anxious to give more weight to this objection than\r\n    it deserves. Man is no longer the child of Nature, nor the\r\n    passive inhabitant of any particular region. He ranges over\r\n    every part of the globe, and elicits nourishment from the\r\n    productions of every climate. Nature is very kind in favouring\r\n    the growth of those productions which are most likely to answer\r\n    our local wants. Those climates, for instance, which engender\r\n    endemic diseases, are, in general, congenial to the growth of\r\n    plants that operate as antidotes to them. But if we go to the\r\n    East for tea, there is no reason why we should not go to the\r\n    West for sugar. The dyspeptic invalid, however, should be\r\n    cautious in their use; they may afford temporary benefit, at the\r\n    expense of permanent mischief. It has been well said, that the\r\n    best quality of spices is to stimulate the appetite, and their\r\n    worst to destroy, by insensible degrees, the tone of the\r\n    stomach. The intrinsic goodness of meats should always be\r\n    suspected when they require spicy seasonings to compensate for\r\n    their natural want of sapidity.\" The quality of pepper is known\r\n    by rubbing it between the hands: that which withstands this\r\n    operation is good, that which is reduced to powder by it is bad.\r\n    The quantity of pepper imported into Europe is very great.\r\n\r\nBENTON SAUCE (to serve with Hot or Cold Roast Beef).\r\n\r\n370. INGREDIENTS.--1 tablespoonful of scraped horseradish, 1 teaspoonful\r\nof made mustard, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 4 tablespoonfuls of\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Grate or scrape the horseradish very fine, and mix it with the\r\nother ingredients, which must be all well blended together; serve in a\r\ntureen. With cold meat, this sauce is a very good substitute for\r\npickles.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 2d.\r\n\r\nBREAD SAUCE (to serve with Roast Turkey, Fowl, Game, &c.).\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n371. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 3/4 of the crumb of a stale loaf, 1\r\nonion; pounded mace, cayenne, and salt to taste; 1 oz. of butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel and quarter the onion, and simmer it in the milk till\r\nperfectly tender. Break the bread, which should be stale, into small\r\npieces, carefully picking out any hard outside pieces; put it in a very\r\nclean saucepan, strain the milk over it, cover it up, and let it remain\r\nfor an hour to soak. Now beat it up with a fork very smoothly, add a\r\nseasoning of pounded mace, cayenne, and salt, with 1 oz. of butter; give\r\nthe whole one boil, and serve. To enrich this sauce, a small quantity of\r\ncream may be added just before sending it to table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1-3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to serve with a turkey, pair of fowls, or brace of\r\npartridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACE.]\r\n\r\n    MACE.--This is the membrane which surrounds the shell of the\r\n    nutmeg. Its general qualities are the same as those of the\r\n    nutmeg, producing an agreeable aromatic odour, with a hot and\r\n    acrid taste. It is of an oleaginous nature, is yellowish in its\r\n    hue, and is used largely as a condiment. In \"Beeton's\r\n    Dictionary\" we find that the four largest of the Banda Islands\r\n    produce 150,000 lbs. of it annually, which, with nutmegs, are\r\n    their principal articles of export.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n372. INGREDIENTS.--Giblets of poultry, 3/4 lb. of the crumb of a stale\r\nloaf, 1 onion, 12 whole peppers, 1 blade of mace, salt to taste, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of cream or melted butter, 1 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the giblets, with the head, neck, legs, &c., into a\r\nstewpan; add the onion, pepper, mace, salt, and rather more than 1 pint\r\nof water. Let this simmer for an hour, when strain the liquor over the\r\nbread, which should be previously grated or broken into small pieces.\r\nCover up the saucepan, and leave it for an hour by the side of the fire;\r\nthen beat the sauce up with a fork until no lumps remain, and the whole\r\nis nice and smooth. Let it boil for 3 or 4 minutes; keep stirring it\r\nuntil it is rather thick; when add 3 tablespoonfuls of good melted\r\nbutter or cream, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/4 hours. _Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWNING FOR GRAVIES AND SAUCES.\r\n\r\n373. The browning for soups (_see_ No. 108) answers equally well for\r\nsauces and gravies, when it is absolutely necessary to colour them in\r\nthis manner; but where they can be made to look brown by using ketchup,\r\nwine, browned flour, tomatoes, or any colour sauce, it is far\r\npreferable. As, however, in cooking, so much depends on appearance,\r\nperhaps it would be as well for the inexperienced cook to use the\r\nartificial means (No. 108). When no browning is at hand, and you wish to\r\nheighten the colour of your gravy, dissolve a lump of sugar in an iron\r\nspoon over a sharp fire; when it is in a liquid state, drop it into the\r\nsauce or gravy quite hot. Care, however, must be taken not to put in too\r\nmuch, as it would impart a very disagreeable flavour.\r\n\r\nBEURRE NOIR, or BROWNED BUTTER (a French Sauce).\r\n\r\n374. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of butter, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley,\r\n3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, salt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the butter into a fryingpan over a nice clear fire, and\r\nwhen it smokes, throw in the parsley, and add the vinegar and seasoning.\r\nLet the whole simmer for a minute or two, when it is ready to serve.\r\nThis is a very good sauce for skate.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLARIFIED BUTTER.\r\n\r\n375. Put the butter in a basin before the fire, and when it melts, stir\r\nit round once or twice, and let it settle. Do not strain it unless\r\nabsolutely necessary, as it causes so much waste. Pour it gently off\r\ninto a clean dry jar, carefully leaving all sediment behind. Let it\r\ncool, and carefully exclude the air by means of a bladder, or piece of\r\nwash-leather, tied over. If the butter is salt, it may be washed before\r\nmelting, when it is to be used for sweet dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELTED BUTTER.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n376. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of butter, a dessertspoonful of flour, 1\r\nwineglassful of water, salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the butter up into small pieces, put it in a saucepan,\r\ndredge over the flour, and add the water and a seasoning of salt; stir\r\nit _one way_ constantly till the whole of the ingredients are melted and\r\nthoroughly blended. Let it just boil, when it is ready to serve. If the\r\nbutter is to be melted with cream, use the same quantity as of water,\r\nbut omit the flour; keep stirring it, but do not allow it to boil.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 minute to simmer.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 4d.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_(More Economical.)_\r\n\r\n377. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of butter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, salt to\r\ntaste, 1/2 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the flour and water to a smooth batter, which put into a\r\nsaucepan. Add the butter and a seasoning of salt, keep stirring _one\r\nway_ till all the ingredients are melted and perfectly smooth; let the\r\nwhole boil for a minute or two, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 minutes to simmer.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 2d.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELTED BUTTER (the French Sauce Blanche).\r\n\r\n378. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of fresh butter, 1 tablespoonful of flour,\r\nsalt to taste, 1/2 gill of water, 1/2 spoonful of white vinegar, a very\r\nlittle grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the flour and water to a smooth batter, carefully rubbing\r\ndown with the back of a spoon any lumps that may appear. Put it in a\r\nsaucepan with all the other ingredients, and let it thicken on the fire,\r\nbut do not allow it to boil, lest it should taste of the flour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 minute to simmer.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 5d. for this quantity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NUTMEG.]\r\n\r\n    NUTMEG.--This is a native of the Moluccas, and was long kept\r\n    from being spread in other places by the monopolizing spirit of\r\n    the Dutch, who endeavoured to keep it wholly to themselves by\r\n    eradicating it from every other island. We find it stated in\r\n    \"Beeton's Dictionary of Universal Information,\" under the\r\n    article \"Banda Islands,\" that the four largest are appropriated\r\n    to the cultivation of nutmegs, of which about 500,000 lbs. are\r\n    annually produced. The plant, through the enterprise of the\r\n    British, has now found its way into Penang and Bencooleu, where\r\n    it flourishes and produces well. It has also been tried to be\r\n    naturalized in the West Indies, and it bears fruit all the year\r\n    round. There are two kinds of nutmeg,--one wild, and long and\r\n    oval-shaped, the other cultivated, and nearly round. The best is\r\n    firm and hard, and has a strong aromatic odour, with a hot and\r\n    acrid taste. It ought to be used with caution by those who are\r\n    of paralytic or apoplectic habits.\r\n\r\nTHICKENED BUTTER.\r\n\r\n379.--INGREDIENTS.--1/4 pint of melted butter, No. 376, the yolks of 2\r\neggs, a little lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the butter quite hot, and be careful not to colour it.\r\nWell whisk the yolks of the eggs, pour them to the butter, beating them\r\nall the while. Make the sauce hot over the fire, but do not let it boil;\r\nadd a squeeze of lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELTED BUTTER MADE WITH MILK.\r\n\r\n380. INGREDIENTS.--1 teaspoonful of flour, 2 oz. butter, 1/3 pint of\r\nmilk, a few grains of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the butter and flour smoothly together on a plate, put it\r\ninto a lined saucepan, and pour in the milk. Keep stirring it _one way_\r\nover a sharp fire; let it boil quickly for a minute or two, and it is\r\nready to serve. This is a very good foundation for onion, lobster, or\r\noyster sauce: using milk instead of water makes it look so much whiter\r\nand more delicate.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 10 minutes. _Average cost_ for this quantity, 3d.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMP VINEGAR.\r\n\r\n381. INGREDIENTS.--1 head of garlic, 1/2 oz. cayenne, 2 teaspoonfuls of\r\nsoy, 2 ditto walnut ketchup, 1 pint of vinegar, cochineal to colour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice the garlic, and put it, with all the above ingredients,\r\ninto a clean bottle. Let it stand to infuse for a month, when strain it\r\noff quite clear, and it will be fit for use. Keep it in small bottles\r\nwell sealed, to exclude the air.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 8d.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPER SAUCE FOR BOILED MUTTON.\r\n\r\n382. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of melted butter (No. 376), 3 tablespoonfuls\r\nof capers or nasturtiums, 1 tablespoonful of their liquor.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the capers twice or thrice, and add them, with their\r\nliquor, to 1/2 pint of melted butter, made very smoothly; keep stirring\r\nwell; let the sauce just simmer, and serve in a tureen. Pickled\r\nnasturtium-pods are fine-flavoured, and by many are eaten in preference\r\nto capers. They make an excellent sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 minutes to simmer. _Average cost_ for this quantity, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to serve with a leg of mutton.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPER SAUCE FOR FISH.\r\n\r\n383. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of melted butter No. 376, 3 dessertspoonfuls\r\nof capers, 1 dessertspoonful of their liquor, a small piece of glaze, if\r\nat hand (this may be dispensed with), 1/4 teaspoonful of salt, ditto of\r\npepper, 1 tablespoonful of anchovy essence.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the capers across once or twice, but do not chop them fine;\r\nput them in a saucepan with 1/2 pint of good melted butter, and add all\r\nthe other ingredients. Keep stirring the whole until it just simmers,\r\nwhen it is ready to serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 minute to simmer. _Average cost_ for this quantity, 5d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to serve with a skate, or 2 or 3 slices of salmon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAPER.]\r\n\r\n    CAPERS.--These are the unopened buds of a low trailing shrub,\r\n    which grows wild among the crevices of the rocks of Greece, as\r\n    well as in northern Africa: the plant, however, has come to be\r\n    cultivated in the south of Europe. After being pickled in\r\n    vinegar and salt, they are imported from Sicily, Italy, and the\r\n    south of France. The best are from Toulon.\r\n\r\nA SUBSTITUTE FOR CAPER SAUCE.\r\n\r\n384. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of melted butter, No. 376, 2 tablespoonfuls\r\nof cut parsley, 1/2 teaspoonful of salt, 1 tablespoonful of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the parsley slowly to let it become a bad colour; cut, but\r\ndo not chop it fine. Add it to 1/2 pint of smoothly-made melted butter,\r\nwith salt and vinegar in the above proportions. Boil up and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 minutes to simmer. Average cost for this quantity, 3d.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLED CAPSICUMS.\r\n\r\n385. INGREDIENTS.--Vinegar, 1/4 oz. of pounded mace, and 1/4 oz. of\r\ngrated nutmeg, to each quart; brine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Gather the pods with the stalks on, before they turn red; slit\r\nthem down the side with a small-pointed knife, and remove the seeds\r\nonly; put them in a strong brine for 3 days, changing it every morning;\r\nthen take them out, lay them on a cloth, with another one over them,\r\nuntil they are perfectly free from moisture. Boil sufficient vinegar to\r\ncover them, with mace and nutmeg in the above proportions; put the pods\r\nin a jar, pour over the vinegar when cold, and exclude them from the air\r\nby means of a wet bladder tied over.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAYENNE VINEGAR, or ESSENCE OF CAYENNE.\r\n\r\n386. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 oz. of cayenne pepper, 1/2 pint of strong spirit,\r\nor 1 pint of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the vinegar, or spirit, into a bottle, with the above\r\nproportion of cayenne, and let it steep for a month, when strain off and\r\nbottle for use. This is excellent seasoning for soups or sauces, but\r\nmust be used very sparingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nCELERY SAUCE, FOR BOILED TURKEY, POULTRY, &c.\r\n\r\n387. INGREDIENTS.--6 heads of celery, 1 pint of white stock, No. 107, 2\r\nblades of mace, 1 small bunch of savoury herbs; thickening of butter and\r\nflour, or arrowroot, 1/2 pint of cream, lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the celery in salt and water, until tender, and cut it\r\ninto pieces 2 inches long. Put the stock into a stewpan with the mace\r\nand herbs, and let it simmer for 1/2 hour to extract their flavour. Then\r\nstrain the liquor, add the celery and a thickening of butter kneaded\r\nwith flour, or, what is still better, with arrowroot; just before\r\nserving, put in the cream, boil it up and squeeze in a little\r\nlemon-juice. If necessary, add a seasoning of salt and white pepper.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--25 minutes to boil the celery. _Average cost_, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, this quantity, for a boiled turkey.\r\n\r\nThis sauce may be made brown by using gravy instead of white stock, and\r\nflavouring it with mushroom ketchup or Harvey's sauce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARROWROOT.]\r\n\r\n    ARROWROOT.--This nutritious fecula is obtained from the roots of\r\n    a plant which is cultivated in both the East and West Indies.\r\n    When the roots are about a year old, they are dug up, and, after\r\n    being well washed, are beaten to a pulp, which is afterwards, by\r\n    means of water, separated from the fibrous part. After being\r\n    passed through a sieve, once more washed, and then suffered to\r\n    settle, the sediment is dried in the sun, when it has become\r\n    arrowroot. The best is obtained from the West Indies, but a\r\n    large quantity of what is sold in London is adulterated with\r\n    potato-starch. As a means of knowing arrowroot when it is good,\r\n    it may be as well to state, that the genuine article, when\r\n    formed into a jelly, will remain firm for three or four days,\r\n    whilst the adulterated will become as thin as milk in the course\r\n    of twelve hours.\r\n\r\nCELERY SAUCE (a More Simple Recipe).\r\n\r\n388. INGREDIENTS.--4 heads of celery, 1/2 pint of melted butter, made\r\nwith milk (No. 380), 1 blade of pounded mace; salt and white pepper to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the celery, boil it in salt and water till tender, and cut\r\nit into pieces 2 inches long; make 1/2 pint melted butter by recipe No.\r\n380; put in the celery, pounded mace, and seasoning; simmer for three\r\nminutes, when the sauce will be ready to serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--25 minutes to boil the celery. _Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, this quantity, for a boiled fowl.\r\n\r\n\r\nCELERY VINEGAR.\r\n\r\n389. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 oz. of celery-seed, 1 pint of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Crush the seed by pounding it in a mortar; boil the vinegar,\r\nand when cold, pour it to the seed; let it infuse for a fortnight, when\r\nstrain and bottle off for use. This is frequently used in salads.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESTNUT SAUCE FOR FOWLS OR TURKEY.\r\n\r\n390. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of chestnuts, 1/2 pint of white stock, 2\r\nstrips of lemon-peel, cayenne to taste, 1/4 pint of cream or milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel off the outside skin of the chestnuts, and put them into\r\nboiling water for a few minutes; take off the thin inside peel, and put\r\nthem into a saucepan, with the white stock and lemon-peel, and let them\r\nsimmer for 1-1/2 hour, or until the chestnuts are quite tender. Rub the\r\nwhole through a hair-sieve with a wooden spoon; add seasoning and the\r\ncream; let it just simmer, but not boil, and keep stirring all the time.\r\nServe very hot; and quickly. If milk is used instead of cream, a very\r\nsmall quantity of thickening may be required: that, of course, the cook\r\nwill determine.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether nearly two hours. _Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, this quantity, for a turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN CHESTNUT SAUCE.\r\n\r\n391. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of chestnuts, 1/2 pint of stock No. 105, 2\r\nlumps of sugar, 4 tablespoonfuls of Spanish sauce (_see_ Sauces).\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Prepare the chestnuts as in the foregoing recipe, by scalding\r\nand peeling them; put them in a stewpan with the stock and sugar, and\r\nsimmer them till tender. When done, add Spanish sauce in the above\r\nproportion, and rub the whole through a tammy. Keep this sauce rather\r\nliquid, as it is liable to thicken.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour to simmer the chestnuts. _Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENGAL RECIPE FOR MAKING MANGO CHETNEY.\r\n\r\n392. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lbs. of moist sugar, 3/4 lb. of salt, 1/4 lb.\r\nof garlic, 1/4 lb. of onions, 3/4 lb. of powdered ginger, 1/4 lb. of\r\ndried chilies, 3/4 lb. of mustard-seed, 3/4 lb. of stoned raisins, 2\r\nbottles of best vinegar, 30 large unripe sour apples.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--The sugar must be made into syrup; the garlic, onions, and\r\nginger be finely pounded in a mortar; the mustard-seed be washed in cold\r\nvinegar, and dried in the sun; the apples be peeled, cored, and sliced,\r\nand boiled in a bottle and a half of the vinegar. When all this is done,\r\nand the apples are quite cold, put them into a large pan, and gradually\r\nmix the whole of the rest of the ingredients, including the remaining\r\nhalf-bottle of vinegar. It must be well stirred until the whole is\r\nthoroughly blended, and then put into bottles for use. Tie a piece of\r\nwet bladder over the mouths of the bottles, after they are well corked.\r\nThis chetney is very superior to any which can be bought, and one trial\r\nwill prove it to be delicious.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This recipe was given by a native to an English lady, who had\r\nlong been a resident in India, and who, since her return to her native\r\ncountry, has become quite celebrated amongst her friends for the\r\nexcellence of this Eastern relish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GARLIC.]\r\n\r\n    GARLIC.--The smell of this plant is generally considered\r\n    offensive, and it is the most acrimonious in its taste of the\r\n    whole of the alliaceous tribe. In 1548 it was introduced to\r\n    England from the shores of the Mediterranean, where it is\r\n    abundant, and in Sicily it grows naturally. It was in greater\r\n    repute with our ancestors than it is with ourselves, although it\r\n    is still used as a seasoning herb. On the continent, especially\r\n    in Italy, it is much used, and the French consider it an\r\n    essential in many made dishes.\r\n\r\nCHILI VINEGAR.\r\n\r\n393. INGREDIENTS.--50 fresh red English chilies, 1 pint of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pound or cut the chilies in half, and infuse them in the\r\nvinegar for a fortnight, when it will be fit for use. This will be found\r\nan agreeable relish to fish, as many people cannot eat it without the\r\naddition of an acid and cayenne pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER NORTH'S SAUCE FOR MEAT OR GAME.\r\n\r\n394. INGREDIENTS.-1 glass of port wine, 2 tablespoonfuls of Harvey's\r\nsauce, 1 dessertspoonful of mushroom ketchup, ditto of pounded white\r\nsugar, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1/4 teaspoonful of cayenne\r\npepper, ditto of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix all the ingredients thoroughly together, and heat the sauce\r\ngradually, by placing the vessel in which it is made in a saucepan of\r\nboiling water. Do not allow it to boil, and serve directly it is ready.\r\nThis sauce, if bottled immediately, will keep good for a fortnight, and\r\nwill be found excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSOMME, or WHITE STOCK FOR MANY SAUCES.\r\n\r\n395. Consommé is made precisely in the same manner as stock No. 107,\r\nand, for ordinary purposes, will be found quite good enough. When,\r\nhowever, a stronger stock is desired, either put in half the quantity of\r\nwater, or double that of the meat. This is a very good foundation for\r\nall white sauces.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAB SAUCE FOR FISH (equal to Lobster Sauce).\r\n\r\n396. INGREDIENTS.--1 crab; salt, pounded mace, and cayenne to taste; 1/2\r\npint of melted butter made with milk (_see_ No. 380).\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose a nice fresh crab, pick all the meat away from the\r\nshell, and cut it into small square pieces. Make 1/2 pint of melted\r\nbutter by recipe No. 380, put in the fish and seasoning; let it\r\ngradually warm through, and simmer for 2 minutes. It should not boil.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 2d.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAM SAUCE FOR FISH OR WHITE DISHES.\r\n\r\n397. INGREDIENTS.--1/3 pint of cream, 2 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of\r\nflour, salt and cayenne to taste; when liked, a small quantity of\r\npounded mace or lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the butter in a very clean saucepan, dredge in the flour,\r\nand keep shaking round till the butter is melted. Add the seasoning and\r\ncream, and stir the whole till it boils; let it just simmer for 5\r\nminutes, when add either pounded mace or lemon-juice to taste, to give\r\nit a flavour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes to simmer. _Average cost_ for this quantity, 7d.\r\n\r\nThis sauce may be flavoured with very finely-shredded shalot.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCUMBER SAUCE.\r\n\r\n398. INGREDIENTS.--3 or 4 cucumbers, 2 oz. of butter, 6 tablespoonfuls\r\nof brown gravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the cucumbers, quarter them, and take out the seeds; cut\r\nthem into small pieces; put them in a cloth, and rub them well, to take\r\nout the water which hangs about them. Put the butter in a saucepan, add\r\nthe cucumbers, and shake them over a sharp fire until they are of a good\r\ncolour. Then pour over it the gravy, mix this with the cucumbers, and\r\nsimmer gently for 10 minutes, when it will be ready to serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLED CUCUMBERS.\r\n\r\n399. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of whole pepper, 1 oz. of bruised ginger;\r\nsufficient vinegar to cover the cucumbers.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the cucumbers in thick slices, sprinkle salt over them, and\r\nlet them remain for 24 hours. The next day, drain them well for 6 hours,\r\nput them into a jar, pour boiling vinegar over them, and keep them in a\r\nwarm place. In a short time, boil up the vinegar again, add pepper and\r\nginger in the above proportion, and instantly cover them up. Tie them\r\ndown with bladder, and in a few days they will be fit for use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONG PEPPER.]\r\n\r\n    LONG PEPPER.--This is the produce of a different plant from that\r\n    which produces the black, it consisting of the half-ripe\r\n    flower-heads of what naturalists call _Piper longum_ and\r\n    _chaba_. It is the growth, however, of the same countries;\r\n    indeed, all the spices are the produce of tropical climates\r\n    only. Originally, the most valuable of these were found in the\r\n    Spice Islands, or Moluccas, of the Indian Ocean, and were highly\r\n    prized by the nations of antiquity. The Romans indulged in them\r\n    to a most extravagant degree. The long pepper is less aromatic\r\n    than the black, but its oil is more pungent.\r\n\r\nCUCUMBER SAUCE, WHITE.\r\n\r\n400. INGREDIENTS.--3 or four cucumbers, 1/2 pint of white stock, No.\r\n107, cayenne and salt to taste, the yolks of 3 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the cucumbers into small pieces, after peeling them and\r\ntaking out the seeds. Put them in a stewpan with the white stock and\r\nseasoning; simmer gently till the cucumbers are tender, which will be in\r\nabout 1/4 hour. Then add the yolks of the eggs well beaten; stir them to\r\nthe sauce, but do not allow it to boil, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCUMBER VINEGAR (a very nice Addition to Salads).\r\n\r\n401. INGREDIENTS.--10 large cucumbers, or 12 smaller ones, 1 quart of\r\nvinegar, 2 onions, 2 shalots, 1 tablespoonful of salt, 2 tablespoonfuls\r\nof pepper, 1/4 teaspoonful of cayenne.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare and slice the cucumbers, put them in a stone jar or\r\nwide-mouthed bottle, with the vinegar; slice the onions and shalots, and\r\nadd them, with all the other ingredients, to the cucumbers. Let it stand\r\n4 or 5 days, boil it all up, and when cold, strain the liquor through a\r\npiece of muslin, and store it away in small bottles well sealed. This\r\nvinegar is a very nice addition to gravies, hashes, &e., as well as a\r\ngreat improvement to salads, or to eat with cold meat.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN METHOD OF KEEPING CUCUMBERS FOR WINTER USE.\r\n\r\n402. INGREDIENTS.--Cucumbers, salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare and slice the cucumbers (as for the table), sprinkle well\r\nwith salt, and let them remain for 24 hours; strain off the liquor, pack\r\nin jars, a thick layer of cucumbers and salt alternately; tie down\r\nclosely, and, when wanted for use, take out the quantity required. Now\r\nwash them well in fresh water, and dress as usual with pepper, vinegar,\r\nand oil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CUCUMBER.]\r\n\r\n    THE CUCUMBER.--Though the melon is far superior in point of\r\n    flavour to this fruit, yet it is allied to the cucumber, which\r\n    is known to naturalists as _Cucumia sativus_. The modern\r\n    Egyptians, as did their forefathers, still eat it, and others of\r\n    its class. Cucumbers were observed, too, by Bishop Heber,\r\n    beyond the Ganges, in India; and Burckhardt noticed them in\r\n    Palestine. (See No. 127.)\r\n\r\nAN EXCELLENT WAY OF PRESERVING CUCUMBERS.\r\n\r\n403. INGREDIENTS.--Salt and water; 1 lb. of lump sugar, the rind of 1\r\nlemon, 1 oz. of ginger, cucumbers.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose the greenest cucumbers, and those that are most free\r\nfrom seeds; put them in strong salt and water, with a cabbage-leaf to\r\nkeep them down; tie a paper over them, and put them in a warm place till\r\nthey are yellow; then wash them and set them over the fire in fresh\r\nwater, with a very little salt, and another cabbage-leaf over them;\r\ncover very closely, but take care they do not boil. If they are not a\r\nfine green, change the water again, cover them as before, and make them\r\nhot. When they are a good colour, take them off the fire and let them\r\ncool; cut them in quarters, take out the seeds and pulp, and put them\r\ninto cold water. Let them remain for 2 days, changing the water twice\r\neach day, to draw out the salt. Put the sugar, with 1/4 pint of water,\r\nin a saucepan over the fire; remove the scum as it rises, and add the\r\nlemon-peel and ginger with the outside scraped off; when the syrup is\r\ntolerably thick, take it off the fire, and when _cold_, wipe the\r\ncucumbers _dry_, and put them in. Boil the syrup once in 2 or 3 days for\r\n3 weeks; strengthen it if required, and let it be quite cold before the\r\ncucumbers are put in. Great attention must be paid to the directions in\r\nthe commencement of this recipe, as, if these are not properly carried\r\nout, the result will be far from satisfactory.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This recipe should be used in June, July, or August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SALT-MINE AT NORTHWICH.]\r\n\r\n    COMMON SALT.--By this we mean salt used for cooking purposes,\r\n    which is found in great abundance both on land and in the waters\r\n    of the ocean. Sea or salt water, as it is often called,\r\n    contains, it has been discovered, about three per cent, of salt\r\n    on an average. Solid rocks of salt are also found in various\r\n    parts of the world, and the county of Chester contains many of\r\n    these mines, and it is from there that much of our salt comes.\r\n    Some springs are so highly impregnated with salt, as to have\r\n    received the name of \"brine\" springs, and are supposed to have\r\n    become so by passing through the salt rocks below ground, and\r\n    thus dissolving a portion of this mineral substance. We here\r\n    give an engraving of a salt-mine at Northwich, Cheshire, where\r\n    both salt-mines and brine-springs are exceedingly productive,\r\n    and are believed to have been wrought so far back as during the\r\n    occupation of Britain by the Romans.\r\n\r\nCUSTARD SAUCE FOR SWEET PUDDINGS OR TARTS.\r\n\r\n404. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 2 eggs, 3 oz. of pounded sugar, 1\r\ntablespoonful of brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk in a very clean saucepan, and let it boil. Beat\r\nthe eggs, stir to them the milk and pounded sugar, and put the mixture\r\ninto a jug. Place the jug in a saucepan of boiling water; keep stirring\r\nwell until it thickens, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle.\r\nServe the sauce in a tureen, stir in the brandy, and grate a little\r\nnutmeg over the top. This sauce may be made very much nicer by using\r\ncream instead of milk; but the above recipe will be found quite good\r\nenough for ordinary purposes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d. per pint.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, this quantity, for 2 fruit tarts, or 1 pudding.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTCH SAUCE FOR FISH.\r\n\r\n405. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 teaspoonful of flour, 2 oz. of butter, 4\r\ntablespoonfuls of vinegar, the yolks of 2 eggs, the juice of 1/2 lemon;\r\nsalt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients, except the lemon-juice, into a\r\nstew-pan; set it over the fire, and keep continually stirring. When it\r\nis sufficiently thick, take it off, as it should not boil. If, however,\r\nit happens to curdle, strain the sauce through a tammy, add the\r\nlemon-juice, and serve. Tarragon vinegar may be used instead of plain,\r\nand, by many, is considered far preferable.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\nNote.--This sauce may be poured hot over salad, and left to get quite\r\ncold, when it should be thick, smooth, and somewhat stiff. Excellent\r\nsalads may be made of hard eggs, or the remains of salt fish flaked\r\nnicely from the bone, by pouring over a little of the above mixture when\r\nhot, and allowing it to cool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LEMON.]\r\n\r\n    THE LEMON.--This fruit is a native of Asia, and is mentioned by\r\n    Virgil as an antidote to poison. It is hardier than the orange,\r\n    and, as one of the citron tribe, was brought into Europe by the\r\n    Arabians. The lemon was first cultivated in England in the\r\n    beginning of the 17th century, and is now often to be found in\r\n    our green-houses. The kind commonly sold, however, is imported\r\n    from Portugal, Spain, and the Azores. Some also come from St.\r\n    Helena; but those from Spain are esteemed the best. Its juice is\r\n    now an essential for culinary purposes; but as an antiscorbutic\r\n    its value is still greater. This juice, which is called _citric\r\n    acid_, may be preserved in bottles for a considerable time, by\r\n    covering it with a thin stratum of oil. _Shrub_ is made from it\r\n    with rum and sugar.\r\n\r\nGREEN DUTCH SAUCE, or HOLLANDAISE VERTE.\r\n\r\n406. INGREDIENTS.--6 tablespoonfuls of Béchamel, No. 367, seasoning to\r\ntaste of salt and cayenne, a little parsley-green to colour, the juice\r\nof 1/2 a lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the Béchamel into a saucepan with the seasoning, and bring\r\nit to a boil. Make a green colouring by pounding some parsley in a\r\nmortar, and squeezing all the juice from it. Let this just simmer, when\r\nadd it to the sauce. A moment before serving, put in the lemon-juice,\r\nbut not before; for otherwise the sauce would turn yellow, and its\r\nappearance be thus spoiled.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d.\r\n\r\n    BÉCHAMEL SAUCE--This sauce takes its name from a Monsieur\r\n    Béchamel, a rich French financier, who, according to Borne\r\n    authorities, invented it; whilst others affirm he only\r\n    patronized it. Be this as it may, it is one of the most pleasant\r\n    sauces which come to table, and should be most carefully and\r\n    intelligently prepared. It is frequently used, as in the above\r\n    recipe, as a principal ingredient and basis for other sauces.\r\n\r\nTO PICKLE EGGS.\r\n\r\n407. INGREDIENTS.--16 eggs, 1 quart of vinegar, 1/2 oz. of Black pepper,\r\n1/2 oz. of Jamaica pepper, 1/2 oz. of ginger.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the eggs for 12 minutes, then dip them into cold water,\r\nand take off the shells. Put the vinegar, with the pepper and ginger,\r\ninto a stewpan, and let it simmer for 10 minutes. Now place the eggs in\r\na jar, pour over them the vinegar, &c., boiling hot, and, when cold, tie\r\nthem down with bladder to exclude the air. This pickle will be ready for\r\nuse in a month.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 1s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This should be made about Easter, as at this time eggs\r\nare plentiful and cheap. A store of pickled eggs will be found very\r\nuseful and ornamental in serving with many first and second course\r\ndishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GINGER.]\r\n\r\n    The ginger-plant, known to naturalists as _Zingiber officinale_,\r\n    is a native, of the East and West Indies. It grows somewhat like\r\n    the lily of the valley, but its height is about three feet. In\r\n    Jamaica it flowers about August or September, fading about the\r\n    end of the year. The fleshy creeping roots, which form the\r\n    ginger of commerce, are in a proper state to be dug when the\r\n    stalks are entirely withered. This operation is usually\r\n    performed in January and February; and when the roots are taken\r\n    out of the earth, each one is picked, scraped, separately\r\n    washed, and afterwards very carefully dried. Ginger is generally\r\n    considered as less pungent and heating to the system than might\r\n    he expected from its effects on the organs of taste, and it is\r\n    frequently used, with considerable effect, as an anti-spasmodic\r\n    and carminative.\r\n\r\nEGG BALLS FOR SOUPS AND MADE DISHES.\r\n\r\n408. INGREDIENTS.--8 eggs, a little flour; seasoning to taste of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil 6 eggs for 20 minutes, strip off the shells, take the\r\nyolks and pound them in a mortar. Beat the yolks of the other 2 eggs;\r\nadd them, with a little flour and salt, to those pounded; mix all well\r\ntogether, and roll into balls. Boil them before they are put into the\r\nsoup or other dish they may be intended for.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to boil the eggs. _Average cost_, for this quantity,\r\n8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, 2 dozen balls for 1 tureen of soup.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGG SAUCE FOR SALT FISH.\r\n\r\n409. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1/2 pint of melted butter, No. 376; when\r\nliked, a very little lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the eggs until quite hard, which will be in about 20\r\nminutes, and put them into cold water for 1/2 hour. Strip off the\r\nshells, chop the eggs into small pieces, not, however, too fine. Make\r\nthe melted butter very smoothly, by recipe No. 376, and, when boiling,\r\nstir in the eggs, and serve very hot. Lemon-juice may be added at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to boil the eggs. _Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--This quantity for 3 or 4 lbs. of fish.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--When a thicker sauce is required, use one or two more eggs to\r\nthe same quantity of melted butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPICUREAN SAUCE FOR STEAKS, CHOPS, GRAVIES, OR FISH.\r\n\r\n410. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 pint of walnut ketchup, 1/4 pint of mushroom\r\nditto, 2 tablespoonfuls of Indian soy, 2 tablespoonfuls of port wine;\r\n1/4 oz. of white pepper, 2 oz. of shalots, 1/4 oz. of cayenne, 1/4 oz.\r\nof cloves, 3/4 pint of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the whole of the ingredients into a bottle, and let it\r\nremain for a fortnight in a warm place, occasionally shaking up the\r\ncontents. Strain, and bottle off for use. This sauce will be found an\r\nagreeable addition to gravies, hashes, stews, &c.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHALOT.]\r\n\r\n    SHALOT, OR ESCHALOT.--This plant is supposed to have been\r\n    introduced to England by the Crusaders, who found it growing\r\n    wild in the vicinity of Ascalon. It is a bulbous root, and when\r\n    full grown, its leaves wither in July. They ought to be taken up\r\n    in the autumn, and when dried in the house, will keep till\r\n    spring. It is called by old authors the \"barren onion,\" and is\r\n    used in sauces and pickles, soups and made dishes, and as an\r\n    accompaniment to chops and steaks.\r\n\r\nESPAGNOLE, OR BROWN SPANISH SAUCE.\r\n\r\n411. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of lean ham, 1 lb. of veal, 1-1/2 pint of\r\nwhite stock, No. 107; 2 or 3 sprigs of parsley, 1/2 a bay-leaf, 2 or 3\r\nsprigs of savoury herbs, 6 green onions, 3 shalots, 2 cloves, 1 blade of\r\nmace, 2 glasses of sherry or Madeira, thickening of butter and flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the ham and veal into small square pieces, and put them\r\ninto a stewpan. Moisten these with 1/2 pint of the stock No. 107, and\r\nsimmer till the bottom of the stewpan is covered with a nicely-coloured\r\nglaze, when put in a few more spoonfuls to detach it. Add the remainder\r\nof the stock, with the spices, herbs, shalots, and onions, and simmer\r\nvery gently for 1 hour. Strain and skim off every particle of fat, and\r\nwhen required for use, thicken with butter and flour, or with a little\r\nroux. Add the wine, and, if necessary, a seasoning of cayenne; when it\r\nwill be ready to serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. per pint.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The wine in this sauce may be omitted, and an onion sliced and\r\nfried of a nice brown substituted for it. This sauce or gravy is used\r\nfor many dishes, and with most people is a general favourite.\r\n\r\n\r\nFENNEL SAUCE FOR MACKEREL.\r\n\r\n412. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of melted butter, No. 376, rather more than\r\n1 tablespoonful of chopped fennel.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the melted butter very smoothly, by recipe No. 376; chop\r\nthe fennel rather small, carefully cleansing it from any grit or dirt,\r\nand put it to the butter when this is on the point of boiling. Simmer\r\nfor a minute or two, and serve in a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to serve with 5 or 6 mackerel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FENNEL.]\r\n\r\n    FENNEL.--This elegantly-growing plant, of which the Latin name\r\n    is _Anethum foeniculum_, grows best in chalky soils, where,\r\n    indeed, it is often found wild. It is very generally cultivated\r\n    in gardens, and has much improved on its original form. Various\r\n    dishes are frequently ornamented and garnished with its graceful\r\n    leaves, and these are sometimes boiled in soups, although it is\r\n    more usually confined, in English cookery, to the mackerel sauce\r\n    as here given.\r\n\r\nFISH SAUCE.\r\n\r\n413. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 oz. of cayenne, 2 tablespoonfuls of walnut\r\nketchup, 2 tablespoonfuls of soy, a few shreds of garlic and shalot, 1\r\nquart of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a large bottle, and shake well\r\nevery day for a fortnight. Keep it in small bottles well sealed, and in\r\na few days it will be fit for use.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 1s.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCEMEAT BALLS FOR FISH SOUPS.\r\n\r\n414. INGREDIENTS.--1 middling-sized lobster, 1/2 an anchovy, 1 head of\r\nboiled celery, the yolk of a hard-boiled egg; salt, cayenne, and mace to\r\ntaste; 4 tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, 2 oz. of butter, 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the meat from the shell of the lobster, and pound it, with\r\nthe soft parts, in a mortar; add the celery, the yolk of the hard-boiled\r\negg, seasoning, and bread crumbs. Continue pounding till the whole is\r\nnicely amalgamated. Warm the butter till it is in a liquid state; well\r\nwhisk the eggs, and work these up with the pounded lobster-meat. Make\r\ninto balls of about an inch in diameter, and fry of a nice pale brown.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, from 18 to 20 balls for 1 tureen of soup.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCEMEAT FOR COLD SAVOURY PIES.\r\n\r\n415. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of veal, 1 lb. of fat bacon; salt, cayenne,\r\npepper, and pounded mace to taste; a very little nutmeg, the same of\r\nchopped lemon-peel, 1/2 teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 1/2 teaspoonful\r\nof minced savoury herbs, 1 or 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the veal and bacon together, and put them in a mortar with\r\nthe other ingredients mentioned above. Pound well, and bind with 1 or 2\r\neggs which have been previously beaten and strained. Work the whole well\r\ntogether, and the forcemeat will be ready for use. If the pie is not to\r\nbe eaten immediately, omit the herbs and parsley, as these would prevent\r\nit from keeping. Mushrooms or truffles may be added.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 small pies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARJORAM.]\r\n\r\n    MARJORAM.--Although there are several species of marjoram, that\r\n    which is known as the sweet or knotted marjoram, is the one\r\n    usually preferred in cookery. It is a native of Portugal, and\r\n    when its leaves are used as a seasoning herb, they have an\r\n    agreeable aromatic flavour. The winter sweet marjoram used for\r\n    the same purposes, is a native of Greece, and the pot-marjoram\r\n    is another variety brought from Sicily. All of them are\r\n    favourite ingredients in soups, stuffings, &c.\r\n\r\nFORCEMEAT FOR PIKE, CARP, HADDOCK, AND VARIOUS KINDS OF FISH.\r\n\r\n416. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of fresh butter, 1 oz. of suet, 1 oz. of fat\r\nbacon, 1 small teaspoonful of minced savoury herbs, including parsley; a\r\nlittle onion, when liked, shredded very fine; salt, nutmeg, and cayenne\r\nto taste; 4 oz. of bread crumbs, 1 egg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix all the ingredients well together, carefully mincing them\r\nvery finely; beat up the egg, moisten with it, and work the whole very\r\nsmoothly together. Oysters or anchovies may be added to this forcemeat,\r\nand will be found a great improvement.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a moderate-sized haddock or pike.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCEMEAT FOR VEAL, TURKEYS, FOWLS, HARE, &c.\r\n\r\n417. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of ham or lean bacon, 1/4 lb. of suet, the rind\r\nof half a lemon, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful of\r\nminced sweet herbs; salt, cayenne, and pounded mace to taste; 6 oz. of\r\nbread crumbs, 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Shred the ham or bacon, chop the suet, lemon-peel, and herbs,\r\ntaking particular care that all be very finely minced; add a seasoning\r\nto taste, of salt, cayenne, and mace, and blend all thoroughly together\r\nwith the bread crumbs, before wetting. Now beat and strain the eggs,\r\nwork these up with the other ingredients, and the forcemeat will be\r\nready for use. When it is made into balls, fry of a nice brown, in\r\nboiling lard, or put them on a tin and bake for 1/2 hour in a moderate\r\noven. As we have stated before, no one flavour should predominate\r\ngreatly, and the forcemeat should be of sufficient body to cut with a\r\nknife, and yet not dry and heavy. For very delicate forcemeat, it is\r\nadvisable to pound the ingredients together before binding with the egg;\r\nbut for ordinary cooking, mincing very finely answers the purpose.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a turkey, a moderate-sized fillet of veal, or a hare.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--In forcemeat for HARE, the liver of the animal is sometimes\r\nadded. Boil for 5 minutes, mince it very small, and mix it with the\r\nother ingredients. If it should be in an unsound state, it must be on no\r\naccount made use of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BASIL.]\r\n\r\n    SWEET HERBS.--Those most usually employed for purposes of\r\n    cooking, such as the flavouring of soups, sauces, forcemeats,\r\n    &c., are thyme, sage, mint, marjoram, savory, and basil. Other\r\n    sweet herbs are cultivated for purposes of medicine and\r\n    perfumery: they are most grateful both to the organs of taste\r\n    and smelling; and to the aroma derived from them is due, in a\r\n    great measure, the sweet and exhilarating fragrance of our\r\n    \"flowery meads.\" In town, sweet herbs have to be procured at the\r\n    greengrocers' or herbalists', whilst, in the country, the garden\r\n    should furnish all that are wanted, the cook taking great care\r\n    to have some dried in the autumn for her use throughout the\r\n    winter months.\r\n\r\nFORCEMEAT FOR BAKED PIKE.\r\n\r\n418. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of bread crumbs, 1 teaspoonful of minced\r\nsavoury herbs, 8 oysters, 2 anchovies (these may be dispensed with), 2\r\noz. of suet; salt, pepper, and pounded mace to taste; 6 tablespoonfuls\r\nof cream or milk, the yolks of 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beard and mince the oysters, prepare and mix the other\r\ningredients by recipe No. 416, and blend the whole thoroughly together.\r\nMoisten with the cream and eggs, put all into a stewpan, and stir it\r\nover the fire till it thickens, when put it into the fish, which should\r\nhave previously been cut open, and sew it up.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 or 6 minutes to thicken.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a moderate-sized pike.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH FORCEMEAT.\r\n\r\n419. It will be well to state, in the beginning of this recipe, that\r\nFrench forcemeat, or quenelles, consist of the blending of three\r\nseparate processes; namely, panada, udder, and whatever meat you intend\r\nusing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPANADA.\r\n\r\n420. INGREDIENTS.--The crumb of 2 penny rolls, 4 tablespoonfuls of white\r\nstock, No. 107, 1 oz. of butter, 1 slice of ham, 1 bay-leaf, a little\r\nminced parsley, 2 shalots, 1 clove, 2 blades of mace, a few mushrooms\r\n(when obtainable), butter, the yolks of 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Soak the crumb of the rolls in milk for about 1/2 hour, then\r\ntake it out, and squeeze so as to press the milk from it; put the soaked\r\nbread into a stewpan with the above quantity of white stock, and set it\r\non one side; then put into a separate stewpan 1 oz. of butter, a slice\r\nof lean ham cut small, with a bay-leaf, herbs, mushrooms, spices, &c.,\r\nin the above proportions, and fry them gently over a slow fire. When\r\ndone, moisten with 2 teacupfuls of white stock, boil for 20 minutes, and\r\nstrain the whole through a sieve over the panada in the other stewpan.\r\nPlace it over the fire, keep constantly stirring, to prevent its\r\nburning, and when quite dry, put in a small piece of butter. Let this\r\nagain dry up by stirring over the fire; then add the yolks of 2 eggs,\r\nmix well, put the panada to cool on a clean plate, and use it when\r\nrequired. Panada should always be well flavoured, as the forcemeat\r\nreceives no taste from any of the other ingredients used in its\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoiled Calf's Udder for French Forcemeats.\r\n\r\n421. Put the udder into a stewpan with sufficient water to cover it; let\r\nit stew gently till quite done, when take it out to cool. Trim all the\r\nupper parts, cut it into small pieces, and pound well in a mortar, till\r\nit can be rubbed through a sieve. That portion which passes through the\r\nstrainer is one of the three ingredients of which French forcemeats are\r\ngenerally composed; but many cooks substitute butter for this, being a\r\nless troublesome and more expeditious mode of preparation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PESTLE AND MORTAR.]\r\n\r\n    PESTLE AND MORTAR.--No cookery can be perfectly performed\r\n    without the aid of the useful instruments shown in the\r\n    engraving. For pounding things sufficiently fine, they are\r\n    invaluable, and the use of them will save a good deal of time,\r\n    besides increasing the excellence of the preparations. They are\r\n    made of iron, and, in that material, can be bought cheap; but as\r\n    these are not available, for all purposes, we should recommend,\r\n    as more economical in the end, those made of Wedgwood, although\r\n    these are considerably more expensive than the former.\r\n\r\nVeal Quenelles.\r\n\r\n422. INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of veal, panada (No. 420), and\r\ncalf's udder (No. 421), 2 eggs; seasoning to taste of pepper, salt, and\r\npounded mace, or grated nutmeg; a little flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take the fleshy part of veal, scrape it with a knife, till all\r\nthe meat is separated from the sinews, and allow about 1/2 lb. for an\r\nentrée. Chop the meat, and pound it in a mortar till reduced to a paste;\r\nthen roll it into a ball; make another of panada (No. 420), the same\r\nsize, and another of udder (No. 421), taking care that these three balls\r\nbe of the same _size_. It is to be remembered, that equality of _size_,\r\nand not of weight, is here necessary. When the three ingredients are\r\nproperly prepared, pound them altogether in a mortar for some time; for\r\nthe more quenelles are pounded, the more delicate they are. Now moisten\r\nwith the eggs, whites and yolks, and continue pounding, adding a\r\nseasoning of pepper, spices, &c. When the whole is well blended\r\ntogether, mould it into balls, or whatever shape is intended, roll them\r\nin flour, and poach in boiling water, to which a little salt should have\r\nbeen added. If the quenelles are not firm enough, add the yolk of\r\nanother egg, but omit the white, which only makes them hollow and puffy\r\ninside. In the preparation of this recipe, it would be well to bear in\r\nmind that the ingredients are to be well pounded and seasoned, and must\r\nbe made hard or soft according to the dishes they are intended for. For\r\nbrown or white ragoûts they should be firm, and when the quenelles are\r\nused very small, extreme delicacy will be necessary in their\r\npreparation. Their flavour may be varied by using the flesh of rabbit,\r\nfowl, hare, pheasant, grouse, or an extra quantity of mushroom, parsley,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n_Time_,--About 1/4 hour to poach in boiling water.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, 1/2 lb. of veal or other meat, with other ingredients in\r\nproportion, for 1 entrée.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The French are noted for their skill in making forcemeats; one\r\nof the principal causes of their superiority in this respect being, that\r\nthey pound all the ingredients so diligently and thoroughly. Any one\r\nwith the slightest pretensions to refined cookery, must, in this\r\nparticular, implicitly follow the example of our friends across the\r\nChannel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCEMEAT, or QUENELLES, FOR TURTLE SOUP.\r\n\r\n(_See No_. 189.)\r\n\r\n423. SOYER'S RECIPE FOR FORCEMEATS.--Take a pound and a half of lean\r\nveal from the fillet, and cut it in long thin slices; scrape with a\r\nknife till nothing but the fibre remains; put it in a mortar, pound it\r\n10 minutes, or until in a purée; pass it through a wire sieve (use the\r\nremainder in stock); then take 1 pound of good fresh beef suet, which\r\nskin, shred, and chop very fine; put it in a mortar and pound it; then\r\nadd 6 oz. of panada (that is, bread soaked in milk and boiled till\r\nnearly dry) with the suet; pound them well together, and add the veal;\r\nseason with a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter one of pepper, half that of\r\nnutmeg; work all well together; then add four eggs by degrees,\r\ncontinually pounding the contents of the mortar. When well mixed, take a\r\nsmall piece in a spoon, and poach it in some boiling water; and if it is\r\ndelicate, firm, and of a good flavour, it is ready for use.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED BREAD CRUMBS.\r\n\r\n424. Cut the bread into thin slices, place them in a cool oven\r\novernight, and when thoroughly dry and crisp, roll them down into fine\r\ncrumbs. Put some lard, or clarified dripping, into a frying-pan; bring\r\nit to the boiling-point, throw in the crumbs, and fry them very quickly.\r\nDirectly they are done, lift them out with a slice, and drain them\r\nbefore the fire from all greasy moisture. When quite crisp, they are\r\nready for use. The fat they are fried in should be clear, and the crumbs\r\nshould not have the slightest appearance or taste of having been, in the\r\nleast degree, burnt.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED SIPPETS OF BREAD (for Garnishing many Dishes).\r\n\r\n425. Cut the bread into thin slices, and stamp them out in whatever\r\nshape you like,--rings, crosses, diamonds, &c. &c. Fry them in the same\r\nmanner as the bread crumbs, in clear boiling lard, or clarified\r\ndripping, and drain them until thoroughly crisp before the fire. When\r\nvariety is desired, fry some of a pale colour, and others of a darker\r\nhue.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED BREAD FOR BORDERS.\r\n\r\n426. Proceed as above, by frying some slices of bread cut in any\r\nfanciful shape. When quite crisp, dip one side of the sippet into the\r\nbeaten white of an egg mixed with a little flour, and place it on the\r\nedge of the dish. Continue in this manner till the border is completed,\r\narranging the sippets a pale and a dark one alternately.\r\n\r\nGENEVESE SAUCE FOR SALMON, TROUT, &c.\r\n\r\n427. INGREDIENTS.--1 small carrot, a small faggot of sweet herbs,\r\nincluding parsley, 1 onion, 5 or 6 mushrooms (when obtainable), 1\r\nbay-leaf, 6 cloves, 1 blade of mace, 2 oz. of butter, 1 glass of sherry,\r\n1-1/2 pint of white stock, No. 107, thickening of butter and flour, the\r\njuice of half a lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the onion and carrot into small rings, and put them into\r\na stewpan with the herbs, mushrooms, bay-leaf, cloves, and mace; add the\r\nbutter, and simmer the whole very gently over a slow fire until the\r\nonion is quite tender. Pour in the stock and sherry, and stew slowly for\r\n1 hour, when strain it off into a clean saucepan. Now make a thickening\r\nof butter and flour, put it to the sauce, stir it over the fire until\r\nperfectly smooth and mellow, add the lemon-juice, give one boil, when it\r\nwill be ready for table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 3d per pint.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, half this quantity for two slices of salmon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAGE.]\r\n\r\n    SAGE.--This was originally a native of the south of Europe, but\r\n    it has long been cultivated in the English garden. There are\r\n    several kinds of it, known as the green, the red, the\r\n    small-leaved, and the broad-leaved balsamic. In cookery, its\r\n    principal use is for stuffings and sauces, for which purpose the\r\n    red is the most agreeable, and the green the next. The others\r\n    are used for medical purposes.\r\n\r\nPICKLED GHERKINS.\r\n\r\n428. INGREDIENTS.--Salt and water, 1 oz. of bruised ginger, 1/2 oz. of\r\nwhole black pepper, 1/4 oz. of whole allspice, 4 cloves, 2 blades of\r\nmace, a little horseradish. This proportion of pepper, spices, &c., for\r\n1 quart of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the gherkins remain in salt and water for 3 or 4 days, when\r\ntake them out, wipe perfectly dry, and put them into a stone jar. Boil\r\nsufficient vinegar to cover them, with spices and pepper, &c., in the\r\nabove proportion, for 10 minutes; pour it, quite boiling, over the\r\ngherkins, cover the jar with vine-leaves, and put over them a plate,\r\nsetting them near the fire, where they must remain all night. Next day\r\ndrain off the vinegar, boil it up again, and pour it hot over them.\r\nCover up with fresh leaves, and let the whole remain till quite cold.\r\nNow tie down closely with bladder to exclude the air, and in a month or\r\ntwo, they will be fit for use.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 days.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the middle of July to the end of August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GHERKINS.]\r\n\r\n    GHERKINS.--Gherkins are young cucumbers; and the only way in\r\n    which they are used for cooking purposes is pickling them, as by\r\n    the recipe here given. Not having arrived at maturity, they have\r\n    not, of course, so strongly a developed flavour as cucumbers,\r\n    and, as a pickle, they are very general favourites.\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRY SAUCE FOR BOILED MACKEREL.\r\n\r\n429. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of green gooseberries, 3 tablespoonfuls of\r\nBéchamel, No. 367 (veal gravy may be substituted for this), 2 oz. of\r\nfresh butter; seasoning to taste of salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the gooseberries in water until quite tender; strain them,\r\nand rub them through a sieve. Put into a saucepan the Béchamel or gravy,\r\nwith the butter and seasoning; add the pulp from the gooseberries, mix\r\nall well together, and heat gradually through. A little pounded sugar\r\nadded to this sauce is by many persons considered an improvement, as the\r\nsaccharine matter takes off the extreme acidity of the unripe fruit.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Boil the gooseberries from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, this quantity, for a large dish of mackerel.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from May to July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GOOSEBERRY.]\r\n\r\n    THE GOOSEBERRY.--This useful and wholesome fruit (_Ribes\r\n    grossularia_) is thought to be indigenous to the British Isles,\r\n    and may be occasionally found in a wild state in some of the\r\n    eastern counties, although, when uncultivated, it is but a very\r\n    small and inferior berry. The high state of perfection to which\r\n    it has been here brought, is due to the skill of the English\r\n    gardeners; for in no other country does it attain the same size\r\n    and flavour. The humidity of the British climate, however, has\r\n    doubtless something to do with the result; and it is said that\r\n    gooseberries produced in Scotland as far north as Inverness, are\r\n    of a very superior character. Malic and citric acid blended with\r\n    sugar, produce the pleasant flavour of the gooseberry; and upon\r\n    the proper development of these properties depends the success\r\n    of all cooking operations with which they are connected.\r\n\r\nGLAZE FOR COVERING COLD HAMS, TONGUES, &c.\r\n\r\n430. INGREDIENTS.--Stock No. 104 or 107, doubling the quantity of meat\r\nin each.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--We may remark at the outset, that unless glaze is wanted in\r\nvery large quantities, it is seldom made expressly. Either of the stocks\r\nmentioned above, boiled down and reduced very considerably, will be\r\nfound to produce a very good glaze. Put the stock into a stewpan, over a\r\nnice clear fire; let it boil till it becomes somewhat stiff, when keep\r\nstirring, to prevent its burning. The moment it is sufficiently reduced,\r\nand comes to a glaze, turn it out into the glaze-pot, of which we have\r\nhere given an engraving. As, however, this is not to be found in every\r\nestablishment, a white earthenware jar would answer the purpose; and\r\nthis may be placed in a vessel of boiling water, to melt the glaze when\r\nrequired. It should never be warmed in a saucepan, except on the\r\nprinciple of the bain marie, lest it should reduce too much, and become\r\nblack and bitter. If the glaze is wanted of a pale colour, more veal\r\nthan beef should be used in making the stock; and it is as well to omit\r\nturnips and celery, as these impart a disagreeable bitter flavour.\r\n\r\nTO GLAZE COLD JOINTS, &c.--Melt the glaze by placing the vessel which\r\ncontains it, into the bain marie or saucepan of boiling water; brush it\r\nover the meat with a paste-brush, and if in places it is not quite\r\ncovered, repeat the operation. The glaze should not be too dark a\r\ncolour. (_See_ Coloured Cut of Glazed Ham, P.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLAZE-KETTLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BAIN MARIE.]\r\n\r\n    GLAZE-KETTLE.--This is a kettle used for keeping the strong\r\n    stock boiled down to a jelly, which is known by the name of\r\n    glaze. It is composed of two tin vessels, as shown in the cut,\r\n    one of which, the upper,--containing the glaze, is inserted into\r\n    one of larger diameter and containing boiling water. A brush is\r\n    put in the small hole at the top of the lid, and is employed for\r\n    putting the glaze on anything that may require it.\r\n\r\n    THE BAIN MARIE.--So long ago as the time when emperors ruled in\r\n    Rome, and the yellow Tiber passed through a populous and wealthy\r\n    city, this utensil was extensively employed; and it is\r\n    frequently mentioned by that profound culinary chemist of the\r\n    ancients, Apicius. It is an open kind of vessel (as shown in the\r\n    engraving and explained in our paragraph No. 87, on the French\r\n    terms used in modern cookery), filled with boiling or nearly\r\n    boiling water; and into this water should be put all the\r\n    stewpans containing those ingredients which it is desired to\r\n    keep hot. The quantity and quality of the contents of these\r\n    vessels are not at all affected; and if the hour of dinner is\r\n    uncertain in any establishment, by reason of the nature of the\r\n    master's business, nothing is so certain a means of preserving\r\n    the flavour of all dishes as the employment of the bain marie.\r\n\r\nGREEN SAUCE FOR GREEN GEESE OR DUCKLINGS.\r\n\r\n431. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 pint of sorrel-juice, 1 glass of sherry, 1/2 pint\r\nof green gooseberries, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 1 oz. of fresh\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the gooseberries in water until they are quite tender;\r\nmash them and press them through a sieve; put the pulp into a saucepan\r\nwith the above ingredients; simmer for 3 or 4 minutes, and serve very\r\nhot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 or 4 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--We have given this recipe as a sauce for green geese, thinking\r\nthat some of our readers might sometimes require it; but, at the\r\ngenerality of fashionable tables, it is now seldom or never served.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SORREL.]\r\n\r\n    SORREL.--We gather from the pages of Pliny and Apicius, that\r\n    sorrel was cultivated by the Romans in order to give it more\r\n    strength and flavour, and that they also partook of it sometimes\r\n    stewed with mustard, being seasoned with a little oil and\r\n    vinegar. At the present day, English cookery is not much\r\n    indebted to this plant (_Rumex Acetosa_), although the French\r\n    make use of it to a considerable extent. It is found in most\r\n    parts of Great Britain, and also on the continent, growing wild\r\n    in the grass meadows, and, in a few gardens, it is cultivated.\r\n    The acid of sorrel is very _prononcé_, and is what chemists term\r\n    a binoxalate of potash; that is, a combination of oxalic acid\r\n    with potash.\r\n\r\nGENERAL STOCK FOR GRAVIES.\r\n\r\n432. Either of the stocks, Nos. 104, 105, or 107, will be found to\r\nanswer very well for the basis of many gravies, unless these are wanted\r\nvery rich indeed. By the addition of various store sauces, thickening\r\nand flavouring, the stocks here referred to may be converted into very\r\ngood gravies. It should be borne in mind, however, that the goodness and\r\nstrength of spices, wines, flavourings, &c., evaporate, and that they\r\nlose a great deal of their fragrance, if added to the gravy a long time\r\nbefore they are wanted. If this point is attended to, a saving of one\r\nhalf the quantity of these ingredients will be effected, as, with long\r\nboiling, the flavour almost entirely passes away. The shank-bones of\r\nmutton, previously well soaked, will be found a great assistance in\r\nenriching gravies; a kidney or melt, beef skirt, trimmings of meat, &c.\r\n&c., answer very well when only a small quantity is wanted, and, as we\r\nhave before observed, a good gravy need not necessarily be so very\r\nexpensive; for economically-prepared dishes are oftentimes found as\r\nsavoury and wholesome as dearer ones. The cook should also remember that\r\nthe fragrance of gravies should not be overpowered by too much spice, or\r\nany strong essences, and that they should always be warmed in a _bain\r\nmarie_, after they are flavoured, or else in a jar or jug placed in a\r\nsaucepan full of boiling water. The remains of roast-meat gravy should\r\nalways be saved; as, when no meat is at hand, a very nice gravy in haste\r\nmay be made from it, and when added to hashes, ragoûts, &c., is a great\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAVY-KETTLE.]\r\n\r\n    GRAVY-KETTLE.--This is a utensil which will not be found in\r\n    every kitchen; but it is a useful one where it is necessary to\r\n    keep gravies hot for the purpose of pouring over various dishes\r\n    as they are cooking. It is made of copper, and should,\r\n    consequently, be heated over the hot plate, if there be one, or\r\n    a charcoal stove. The price at which it can be purchased is set\r\n    down by Messrs. Slack at 14s.\r\n\r\nGRAVY FOR ROAST MEAT.\r\n\r\n433. INGREDIENTS.--Gravy, salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put a common dish with a small quantity of salt in it under the\r\nmeat, about a quarter of an hour before it is removed from the fire.\r\nWhen the dish is full, take it away, baste the meat, and pour the gravy\r\ninto the dish on which the joint is to be served.\r\n\r\n    SAUCES AND GRAVIES IN THE MIDDLE AGES.--Neither poultry,\r\n    butcher's meat, nor roast game were eaten dry in the middle\r\n    ages, any more than fried fish is now. Different sauces, each\r\n    having its own peculiar flavour, were served with all these\r\n    dishes, and even with the various _parts_ of each animal.\r\n    Strange and grotesque sauces, as, for example, \"eggs cooked on\r\n    the spit,\" \"butter fried and roasted,\" were invented by the\r\n    cooks of those days; but these preparations had hardly any other\r\n    merit than that of being surprising and difficult to make.\r\n\r\nA QUICKLY-MADE GRAVY.\r\n\r\n434. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of shin of beef, 1/2 onion, 1/4 carrot, 2 or\r\n3 sprigs of parsley and savoury herbs, a piece of butter about the size\r\nof a walnut; cayenne and mace to taste, 3/4 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the meat into very small pieces, slice the onion and\r\ncarrot, and put them into a small saucepan with the butter. Keep\r\nstirring over a sharp fire until they have taken a little colour, when\r\nadd the water and the remaining ingredients. Simmer for 1/2 hour, skim\r\nwell, strain, and flavour, when it will be ready for use.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, for this quantity, 5d.\r\n\r\n    A HUNDRED DIFFERENT DISHES.--Modern housewives know pretty well\r\n    how much care, and attention, and foresight are necessary in\r\n    order to serve well a little dinner for six or eight persons,--a\r\n    dinner which will give credit to the _ménage_, and satisfaction\r\n    and pleasure to the guests. A quickly-made gravy, under some\r\n    circumstances that we have known occur, will be useful to many\r\n    housekeepers when they have not much time for preparation. But,\r\n    talking of speed, and time, and preparation, what a combination\r\n    of all these must have been necessary for the feast at the\r\n    wedding of Charles VI. of France. On that occasion, as Froissart\r\n    the chronicler tells us, the art of cooking, with its\r\n    innumerable paraphernalia of sauces, with gravy, pepper,\r\n    cinnamon, garlic, scallion, brains, gravy soups, milk _potage_,\r\n    and ragoûts, had a signal triumph. The skilful _chef-de-cuisine_\r\n    of the royal household covered the great marble table of the\r\n    regal palace with no less than a hundred different dishes,\r\n    prepared in a hundred different ways.\r\n\r\nA GOOD BEEF GRAVY FOR POULTRY, GAME, &c.\r\n\r\n435. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of lean beef, 1/2 pint of cold water, 1\r\nshalot or small onion, 1/2 a teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper, 1\r\ntablespoonful of Harvey's sauce or mushroom ketchup, 1/2 a teaspoonful\r\nof arrowroot.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the beef into small pieces, and put it, with the water,\r\ninto a stewpan. Add the shalot and seasoning, and simmer gently for 3\r\nhours, taking care that it does not boil fast. A short time before it is\r\nrequired, take the arrowroot, and having mixed it with a little cold\r\nwater, pour it into the gravy, which keep stirring, adding the Harvey's\r\nsauce, and just letting it boil. Strain off the gravy in a tureen, and\r\nserve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours. _Average cost_, 8d. per pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN GRAVY.\r\n\r\n436. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of butter, 2 large onions, 2 lbs. of shin of\r\nbeef, 2 small slices of lean bacon (if at hand), salt and whole pepper\r\nto taste, 3 cloves, 2 quarts of water. For thickening, 2 oz. of butter,\r\n3 oz. of flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the butter into a stewpan; set this on the fire, throw in\r\nthe onions cut in rings, and fry them a light brown; then add the beef\r\nand bacon, which should be cut into small square pieces; season, and\r\npour in a teacupful of water; let it boil for about ten minutes, or\r\nuntil it is of a nice brown colour, occasionally stirring the contents.\r\nNow fill up with water in the above proportion; let it boil up, when\r\ndraw it to the side of the fire to simmer very gently for 1-1/2 hour;\r\nstrain, and when cold, take off all the fat. In thickening this gravy,\r\nmelt 3 oz. of butter in a stewpan, add 2 oz. of flour, and stir till of\r\na light-brown colour; when cold, add it to the strained gravy, and boil\r\nit up quickly. This thickening may be made in larger quantities, and\r\nkept in a stone jar for use when wanted.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 2 hours. _Average cost_, 4d. per pint.\r\n\r\n    CLOVES.--This very agreeable spice is the unexpanded flower-buds\r\n    of the _Caryophyllus aromaticus_, a handsome, branching tree, a\r\n    native of the Malacca Islands. They take their name from the\r\n    Latin word _clavus_, or the French _clou_, both meaning a nail,\r\n    and to which the clove has a considerable resemblance. Cloves\r\n    were but little known to the ancients, and Pliny appears to be\r\n    the only writer who mentions them; and he says, vaguely enough,\r\n    that some were brought to Rome, very similar to grains of\r\n    pepper, but somewhat longer; that they were only to be found in\r\n    India, in a wood consecrated to the gods; and that they served\r\n    in the manufacture of perfumes. The Dutch, as in the case of the\r\n    nutmeg (_see_ 378), endeavoured, when they gained possession of\r\n    the Spice Islands, to secure a monopoly of cloves, and, so that\r\n    the cultivation of the tree might be confined to Amboyna, their\r\n    chief island, bribed the surrounding chiefs to cut down all\r\n    trees found elsewhere. The Amboyna, or royal clove, is said to\r\n    be the best, and is rare; but other kinds, nearly equally good,\r\n    are produced in other parts of the world, and they come to\r\n    Europe from Mauritius, Bourbon, Cayenne, and Martinique, as also\r\n    from St. Kitts, St. Vincent's, and Trinidad. The clove contains\r\n    about 20 per cent. of volatile aromatic oil, to which it owes\r\n    its peculiar pungent flavour, its other parts being composed of\r\n    woody fibre, water, gum, and resin.\r\n\r\nBROWN GRAVY WITHOUT MEAT.\r\n\r\n437. INGREDIENTS.--2 large onions, 1 large carrot, 2 oz. of butter, 3\r\npints of boiling water, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, a wineglassful of good\r\nbeer; salt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice, flour, and fry the onions and carrots in the butter\r\nuntil of a nice light-brown colour; then add the boiling water and the\r\nremaining ingredients; let the whole stew gently for about an hour; then\r\nstrain, and when cold, skim off all the fat. Thicken it in the same\r\nmanner as recipe No. 436, and, if thought necessary, add a few drops of\r\ncolouring No. 108.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. Average cost, 2d. per pint.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The addition of a small quantity of mushroom ketchup or\r\nHarvey's sauce very much improves the flavour of this gravy.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICH GRAVY FOR HASHES, RAGOUTS, &c.\r\n\r\n438. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of shin of beef, 1 large onion or a few\r\nshalots, a little flour, a bunch of savoury herbs, 2 blades of mace, 2\r\nor 3 cloves, 4 whole allspice, 1/4 teaspoonful of whole pepper, 1 slice\r\nof lean ham or bacon, 1/2 a head of celery (when at hand), 2 pints of\r\nboiling water; salt and cayenne to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the beef into thin slices, as also the onions, dredge them\r\nwith flour, and fry of a pale brown, but do not allow them to get black;\r\npour in the boiling water, let it boil up; and skim. Add the remaining\r\ningredients, and simmer the whole very gently for 2 hours, or until all\r\nthe juices are extracted from the meat; put it by to get cold, when take\r\noff all the fat. This gravy may be flavoured with ketchup, store sauces,\r\nwine, or, in fact, anything that may give additional and suitable relish\r\nto the dish it is intended for.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d. per pint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIMENTO.]\r\n\r\n    ALLSPICE.--This is the popular name given to pimento, or Jamaica\r\n    pepper, known to naturalists as _Eugenia pimenta_, and belonging\r\n    to the order of Myrtaceae. It is the berry of a fine tree in the\r\n    West Indies and South America, which attains a height of from\r\n    fifteen to twenty feet: the berries are not allowed to ripen,\r\n    but, being gathered green, are then dried in the sun, and then\r\n    become black. It is an inexpensive spice, and is considered more\r\n    mild and innocent than most other spices; consequently, it is\r\n    much used for domestic purposes, combining a very agreeable\r\n    variety of flavours.\r\n\r\nGRAVY MADE WITHOUT MEAT FOR FOWLS.\r\n\r\n439. INGREDIENTS.--The necks, feet, livers, and gizzards of the fowls, 1\r\nslice of toasted bread, 1/2 onion, 1 faggot of savoury herbs, salt and\r\npepper to taste, 1/2 pint of water, thickening of butter and flour, 1\r\ndessertspoonful of ketchup.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the feet of the fowls thoroughly clean, and cut them and\r\nthe neck into small pieces. Put these into a stewpan with the bread,\r\nonion, herbs, seasoning, livers, and gizzards; pour the water over them\r\nand simmer gently for 1 hour. Now take out the liver, pound it, and\r\nstrain the liquor to it. Add a thickening of butter and flour, and a\r\nflavouring of mushroom ketchup; boil it up and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, 4d. per pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHEAP GRAVY FOR HASHES, &c.\r\n\r\n440. INGREDIENTS.--Bones and trimmings of the cooked joint intended for\r\nhashing, 1/4 teaspoonful of salt, 1/4 teaspoonful of whole pepper, 1/4\r\nteaspoonful of whole allspice, a small faggot of savoury herbs, 1/2 head\r\nof celery, 1 onion, 1 oz. of butter, thickening, sufficient boiling\r\nwater to cover the bones.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the bones in small pieces, and put them in a stewpan, with\r\nthe trimmings, salt, pepper, spice, herbs, and celery. Cover with\r\nboiling water, and let the whole simmer gently for 1-1/2 or 2 hours.\r\nSlice and fry the onion in the butter till it is of a pale brown, and\r\nmix it gradually with the gravy made from the bones; boil for  1/4 hour,\r\nand strain into a basin; now put it back into the stewpan; flavour with\r\nwalnut pickle or ketchup, pickled-onion liquor, or any store sauce that\r\nmay be preferred. Thicken with a little butter and flour, kneaded\r\ntogether on a plate, and the gravy will be ready for use. After the\r\nthickening is added, the gravy should just boil, to take off the rawness\r\nof the flour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours, or rather more.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d., exclusive of the bones and trimmings.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUGGED GRAVY (Excellent).\r\n\r\n441. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of shin of beef, 1/4 lb. of lean ham, 1 onion\r\nor a few shalots, 2 pints of water, salt and whole pepper to taste, 1\r\nblade of mace, a faggot of savoury herbs, 1/2 a large carrot, 1/2 a\r\nhead of celery.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the beef and ham into small pieces, and slice the\r\nvegetables; take a jar, capable of holding two pints of water, and\r\narrange therein, in layers, the ham, meat, vegetables, and seasoning,\r\nalternately, filling up with the above quantity of water; tie down the\r\njar, or put a plate over the top, so that the steam may not escape;\r\nplace it in the oven, and let it remain there from 6 to 8 hours; should,\r\nhowever, the oven be very hot, less time will be required. When\r\nsufficiently cooked, strain the gravy, and when cold, remove the fat. It\r\nmay be flavoured with ketchup, wines, or any other store sauce that may\r\nbe preferred.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan to put the jar in a cool oven over-night, to draw the\r\ngravy; and then it will not require so long baking the following day.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 6 to 8 hours, according to the oven.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 7d. per pint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CELERY.]\r\n\r\n    CELERY.--As in the above recipe, the roots of celery are\r\n    principally used in England for flavouring soups, sauces, and\r\n    gravies, and for serving with cheese at the termination of a\r\n    dinner, and as an ingredient for salad. In Italy, however, the\r\n    green leaves and stems are also employed for stews and soups,\r\n    and the seeds are also more frequently made use of on the\r\n    continent than in our own islands. In Germany, celery is very\r\n    highly esteemed; and it is there boiled and served up as a dish\r\n    by itself, as well as used in the composition of mixed dishes.\r\n    We ourselves think that this mild aromatic plant might oftener\r\n    be cooked than it is; for there are very few nicer vegetable\r\n    preparations brought to table than a well-dressed plate of\r\n    stewed celery.\r\n\r\nVEAL GRAVY FOR WHITE SAUCES, FRICASSEES, &c.\r\n\r\n442. INGREDIENTS.--2 slices of nicely flavoured lean ham, any poultry\r\ntrimmings, 3 lbs. of lean veal, a faggot of savoury herbs, including\r\nparsley, a few green onions (or 1 large onion may be substituted for\r\nthese), a few mushrooms, when obtainable; 1 blade of mace, salt to\r\ntaste, 3 pints of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the ham and veal into small square pieces, put these in\r\na stewpan, moistening them with a small quantity of water; place them\r\nover the fire to draw down. When the bottom of the stewpan becomes\r\ncovered with a white glaze, fill up with water in the above proportion;\r\nadd the remaining ingredients, stew very slowly for 3 or 4 hours, and do\r\nnot forget to skim well the moment it boils. Put it by, and, when cold,\r\ntake off all the fat. This may be used for Béchamel, sauce tournée, and\r\nmany other white sauces.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 or 4 hours. _Average cost_, 9d. per pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEAP GRAVY FOR MINCED VEAL.\r\n\r\n443. INGREDIENTS.--Bones and trimmings of cold roast or boiled veal,\r\n1-1/2 pint of water, 1 onion, 1/4 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1/4\r\nteaspoonful of salt, 1 blade of pounded mace, the juice of 1/4 lemon;\r\nthickening of butter and flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a stewpan, except the thickening\r\nand lemon-juice, and let them simmer very gently for rather more than 1\r\nhour, or until the liquor is reduced to a pint, when strain through a\r\nhair-sieve. Add a thickening of butter and flour, and the lemon-juice;\r\nset it on the fire, and let it just boil up, when it will be ready for\r\nuse. It may be flavoured with a little tomato sauce, and, where a rather\r\ndark-coloured gravy is not objected to, ketchup, or Harvey's sauce, may\r\nbe added at pleasure.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1 hour. _Average cost_, 3d.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAVY FOR VENISON.\r\n\r\n444. INGREDIENTS.--Trimmings of venison, 3 or 4 mutton shank-bones, salt\r\nto taste, 1 pint of water, 2 teaspoonfuls of walnut ketchup.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Brown the trimmings over a nice clear fire, and put them in a\r\nstewpan with the shank-bones and water; simmer gently for 2 hours,\r\nstrain and skim, and add the walnut ketchup and a seasoning of salt. Let\r\nit just boil, when it is ready to serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEER.]\r\n\r\n    VENISON.--Far, far away in ages past, our fathers loved the\r\n    chase, and what it brought; and it is usually imagined that when\r\n    Isaac ordered his son Esau to go out with his weapons, his\r\n    quiver and his bow, and to prepare for him savoury meat, such as\r\n    he loved, that it was venison he desired. The wise Solomon, too,\r\n    delighted in this kind of fare; for we learn that, at his table,\r\n    every day were served the wild ox, the roebuck, and the stag.\r\n    Xenophon informs us, in his History, that Cyrus, king of Persia,\r\n    ordered that venison should never be wanting at his repasts; and\r\n    of the effeminate Greeks it was the delight. The Romans, also,\r\n    were devoted admirers of the flesh of the deer; and our own\r\n    kings and princes, from the Great Alfred down to the Prince\r\n    Consort, have hunted, although, it must be confessed, under\r\n    vastly different circumstances, the swift buck, and relished\r\n    their \"haunch\" all the more keenly, that they had borne\r\n    themselves bravely in the pursuit of the animal.\r\n\r\nTO DRY HERBS FOR WINTER USE.\r\n\r\n445. On a very dry day, gather the herbs, just before they begin to\r\nflower. If this is done when the weather is damp, the herbs will not be\r\nso good a colour. (It is very necessary to be particular in little\r\nmatters like this, for trifles constitute perfection, and herbs nicely\r\ndried will be found very acceptable when frost and snow are on the\r\nground. It is hardly necessary, however, to state that the flavour and\r\nfragrance of fresh herbs are incomparably finer.) They should be\r\nperfectly freed from dirt and dust, and be divided into small bunches,\r\nwith their roots cut off. Dry them quickly in a very hot oven, or before\r\nthe fire, as by this means most of their flavour will be preserved, and\r\nbe careful not to burn them; tie them up in paper bags, and keep in a\r\ndry place. This is a very general way of preserving dried herbs; but we\r\nwould recommend the plan described in a former recipe.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--From the month of July to the end of September is the\r\nproper time for storing herbs for winter use.\r\n\r\nHERB POWDER FOR FLAVOURING, when Fresh Herbs are not obtainable.\r\n\r\n446. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of dried lemon-thyme, 1 oz. of dried winter\r\nsavory, 1 oz. of dried sweet marjoram and basil, 2 oz. of dried parsley,\r\n1 oz. of dried lemon-peel.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Prepare and dry the herbs by recipe No. 445; pick the leaves\r\nfrom the stalks, pound them, and sift them through a hair-sieve; mix in\r\nthe above proportions, and keep in glass bottles, carefully excluding\r\nthe air. This, we think, a far better method of keeping herbs, as the\r\nflavour and fragrance do not evaporate so much as when they are merely\r\nput in paper bags. Preparing them in this way, you have them ready for\r\nuse at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\nMint, sage, parsley, &c., dried, pounded, and each put into separate\r\nbottles, will be found very useful in winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORK WITH WOODEN TOP.]\r\n\r\n    CORKS WITH WOODEN TOPS.--These are the best corks to use when it\r\n    is indispensable that the air should not be admitted to the\r\n    ingredients contained in bottles which are in constant use. The\r\n    top, which, as will be seen by the accompanying little cut, is\r\n    larger than the cork, is made of wood; and, besides effectually\r\n    covering the whole top of the bottle, can be easily removed and\r\n    again used, as no corkscrew is necessary to pull it out.\r\n\r\n    SAVORY.--This we find described by Columella, a voluminous Roman\r\n    writer on agriculture, as an odoriferous herb, which, \"in the\r\n    brave days of old,\" entered into the seasoning of nearly every\r\n    dish. Verily, there are but few new things under the sun, and we\r\n    don't find that we have made many discoveries in gastronomy, at\r\n    least beyond what was known to the ancient inhabitants of Italy.\r\n    We possess two varieties of this aromatic herb, known to\r\n    naturalists as _Satureja_. They are called summer and winter\r\n    savory, according to the time of the year when they are fit for\r\n    gathering. Both sorts are in general cultivation throughout\r\n    England.\r\n\r\nHORSERADISH SAUCE, to serve with Roast Beef.\r\n\r\n447. INGREDIENTS.--4 tablespoonfuls of grated horseradish, 1 teaspoonful\r\nof pounded sugar, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1/2 teaspoonful of pepper, 2\r\nteaspoonfuls of made mustard; vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Grate the horseradish, and mix it well with the sugar, salt,\r\npepper, and mustard; moisten it with sufficient vinegar to give it the\r\nconsistency of cream, and serve in a tureen: 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of\r\ncream added to the above, very much improve the appearance and flavour\r\nof this sauce. To heat it to serve with hot roast beef, put it in a bain\r\nmarie or a jar, which place in a saucepan of boiling water; make it hot,\r\nbut do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This sauce is a great improvement on the old-fashioned way of\r\nserving cold-scraped horseradish with hot roast beef. The mixing of the\r\ncold vinegar with the warm gravy cools and spoils everything on the\r\nplate. Of course, with cold meat, the sauce should be served cold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HORSERADISH.]\r\n\r\n    THE HORSERADISH.--This has been, for many years, a favourite\r\n    accompaniment of roast beef, and is a native of England. It\r\n    grows wild in wet ground, but has long been cultivated in the\r\n    garden, and is, occasionally, used in winter salads and in\r\n    sauces. On account of the great volatility of its oil, it should\r\n    never be preserved by drying, but should be kept moist by being\r\n    buried in sand. So rapidly does its volatile oil evaporate, that\r\n    even when scraped for the table, it almost immediately spoils by\r\n    exposure to the air.\r\n\r\nHORSERADISH VINEGAR.\r\n\r\n448. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of scraped horseradish, 1 oz. of minced\r\nshalot, 1 drachm of cayenne, 1 quart of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a bottle, which shake well every\r\nday for a fortnight. When it is thoroughly steeped, strain and bottle,\r\nand it will be fit for use immediately. This will be found an agreeable\r\nrelish to cold beef, &c.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This vinegar should be made either in October or\r\nNovember, as horseradish is then in its highest perfection.\r\n\r\nINDIAN CURRY-POWDER, founded on Dr. Kitchener's Recipe.\r\n\r\n449. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of coriander-seed, 1/4 lb. of turmeric, 2 oz.\r\nof cinnamon-seed, 1/2 oz. of cayenne, 1 oz. of mustard, 1 oz. of ground\r\nginger, 1/2 ounce of allspice, 2 oz. of fenugreek-seed.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients in a cool oven, where they should\r\nremain one night; then pound them in a mortar, rub them through a sieve,\r\nand mix thoroughly together; keep the powder in a bottle, from which the\r\nair should be completely excluded.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--We have given this recipe for curry-powder, as some persons\r\nprefer to make it at home; but that purchased at any respectable shop\r\nis, generally speaking, far superior, and, taking all things into\r\nconsideration, very frequently more economical.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN MUSTARD, an excellent Relish to Bread and Butter, or any cold\r\nMeat.\r\n\r\n450. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of the best mustard, 1/4 lb. of flour, 1/2\r\noz. of salt, 4 shalots, 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 4 tablespoonfuls of\r\nketchup, 1/4 bottle of anchovy sauce.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the mustard, flour, and salt into a basin, and make them\r\ninto a stiff paste with boiling water. Boil the shalots with the\r\nvinegar, ketchup, and anchovy sauce, for 10 minutes, and pour the whole,\r\n_boiling_, over the mixture in the basin; stir well, and reduce it to a\r\nproper thickness; put it into a bottle, with a bruised shalot at the\r\nbottom, and store away for use. This makes an excellent relish, and if\r\nproperly prepared will keep for years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSTARD.]\r\n\r\n    MUSTARD.--Before the year 1729, mustard was not known at English\r\n    tables. About that time an old woman, of the name of Clements,\r\n    residing in Durham, began to grind the seed in a mill, and to\r\n    pass the flour through several processes necessary to free the\r\n    seed from its husks. She kept her secret for many years to\r\n    herself, during which she sold large quantities of mustard\r\n    throughout the country, but especially in London. Here it was\r\n    introduced to the royal table, when it received the approval of\r\n    George I. From the circumstance of Mrs. Clements being a\r\n    resident at Durham, it obtained the name of Durham mustard. In\r\n    the county of that name it is still principally cultivated, and\r\n    the plant is remarkable for the rapidity of its growth. It is\r\n    the best stimulant employed to impart strength to the digestive\r\n    organs, and even in its previously coarsely-pounded state, had a\r\n    high reputation with our ancestors.\r\n\r\nINDIAN PICKLE (very Superior).\r\n\r\n451. INGREDIENTS.--To each gallon of vinegar allow 6 cloves of garlic,\r\n12 shalots, 2 sticks of sliced horseradish, 1/4 lb. of bruised ginger, 2\r\noz. of whole black pepper, 1 oz. of long pepper, 1 oz. of allspice, 12\r\ncloves, 1/4 oz. of cayenne, 2 oz. of mustard-seed, 1/4 lb. of mustard, 1\r\noz. of turmeric; a white cabbage, cauliflowers, radish-pods, French\r\nbeans, gherkins, small round pickling-onions, nasturtiums, capsicums,\r\nchilies, &c.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the cabbage, which must be hard and white, into slices, and\r\nthe cauliflowers into small branches; sprinkle salt over them in a large\r\ndish, and let them remain two days; then dry them, and put them into a\r\nvery large jar, with garlic, shalots, horseradish, ginger, pepper,\r\nallspice, and cloves, in the above proportions. Boil sufficient vinegar\r\nto cover them, which pour over, and, when cold, cover up to keep them\r\nfree from dust. As the other things for the pickle ripen at different\r\ntimes, they may be added as they are ready: these will be radish-pods,\r\nFrench beans, gherkins, small onions, nasturtiums, capsicums, chilies,\r\n&c. &c. As these are procured, they must, first of all, be washed in a\r\nlittle cold vinegar, wiped, and then simply added to the other\r\ningredients in the large jar, only taking care that they are _covered_\r\nby the vinegar. If more vinegar should be wanted to add to the pickle,\r\ndo not omit first to boil it before adding it to the rest. When you have\r\ncollected all the things you require, turn all out in a large pan, and\r\nthoroughly mix them. Now put the mixed vegetables into smaller jars,\r\nwithout any of the vinegar; then boil the vinegar again, adding as much\r\nmore as will be required to fill the different jars, and also cayenne,\r\nmustard-seed, turmeric, and mustard, which must be well mixed with a\r\nlittle cold vinegar, allowing the quantities named above to each gallon\r\nof vinegar. Pour the vinegar, boiling hot, over the pickle, and when\r\ncold, tie down with a bladder. If the pickle is wanted for immediate\r\nuse, the vinegar should be boiled twice more, but the better way is to\r\nmake it during one season for use during the next. It will keep for\r\nyears, if care is taken that the vegetables are quite covered by the\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\nThis recipe was taken from the directions of a lady whose pickle was\r\nalways pronounced excellent by all who tasted it, and who has, for many\r\nyears, exactly followed the recipe given above.\r\n\r\n__Note_.--For small families, perhaps the above quantity of pickle will\r\nbe considered too large; but this may be decreased at pleasure, taking\r\ncare to properly proportion the various ingredients.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIA PICKLE.]\r\n\r\n    KEEPING PICKLES.--Nothing shows more, perhaps, the difference\r\n    between a tidy thrifty housewife and a lady to whom these\r\n    desirable epithets may not honestly be applied, than the\r\n    appearance of their respective store-closets. The former is\r\n    able, the moment anything; is wanted, to put her hand on it at\r\n    once; no time is lost, no vexation incurred, no dish spoilt for\r\n    the want of \"just little something,\"--the latter, on the\r\n    contrary, hunts all over her cupboard for the ketchup the cook\r\n    requires, or the pickle the husband thinks he should like a\r\n    little of with his cold roast beef or mutton-chop, and vainly\r\n    seeks for the Embden groats, or arrowroot, to make one of her\r\n    little boys some gruel. One plan, then, we strenuously advise\r\n    all who do not follow, to begin at once, and that is, to label\r\n    all their various pickles and store sauces, in the same way as\r\n    the cut here shows. It will occupy a little time at first, but\r\n    there will be economy of it in the long run.\r\n\r\n    VINEGAR.--This term is derived from the two French words _vin\r\n    aigre_, 'sour wine,' and should, therefore, be strictly applied\r\n    to that which is made only from wine. As the acid is the same,\r\n    however it is procured, that made from ale also takes the same\r\n    name. Nearly all ancient nations were acquainted with the use of\r\n    vinegar. We learn in _Ruth_, that the reapers in the East soaked\r\n    their bread in it to freshen it. The Romans kept large\r\n    quantities of it in their cellars, using it, to a great extent,\r\n    in their seasonings and sauces. This people attributed very\r\n    beneficial qualities to it, as it was supposed to be digestive,\r\n    antibilious, and antiscorbutic, as well as refreshing.\r\n    Spartianus, a Latin historian, tells us that, mixed with water,\r\n    it was the drink of the soldiers, and that, thanks to this\r\n    beverage, the veterans of the Roman army braved, by its use, the\r\n    inclemency and variety of all the different seasons and climates\r\n    of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is said, the Spanish peasantry,\r\n    and other inhabitants of the southern parts of Europe, still\r\n    follow this practice, and add to a gallon of water about a gill\r\n    of wine vinegar, with a little salt; and that this drink, with a\r\n    little bread, enables them, under the heat of their burning sun,\r\n    to sustain the labours of the field.\r\n\r\nINDIAN CHETNEY SAUCE.\r\n\r\n452. INGREDIENTS.--8 oz. of sharp, sour apples, pared and cored; 8 oz.\r\nof tomatoes, 8 oz. of salt, 8 oz. of brown, sugar, 8 oz. of stoned\r\nraisins, 4 oz. of cayenne, 4 oz. of powdered ginger, 2 oz. of garlic, 2\r\noz. of shalots, 3 quarts of vinegar, 1 quart of lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the apples in small square pieces, and add to them the\r\nother ingredients. Mix the whole well together, and put in a\r\nwell-covered jar. Keep this in a warm place, and stir every day for a\r\nmonth, taking care to put on the lid after this operation; strain, but\r\ndo not squeeze it dry; store it away in clean jars or bottles for use,\r\nand the liquor will serve as an excellent sauce for meat or fish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this sauce when tomatoes are in full season, that\r\nis, from the beginning of September to the end of October.\r\n\r\n    PICKLES.--The ancient Greeks and Romans held their pickles in\r\n    high estimation. They consisted of flowers, herbs, roots, and\r\n    vegetables, preserved in vinegar, and which were kept, for a\r\n    long time, in cylindrical vases with wide mouths. Their cooks\r\n    prepared pickles with the greatest care, and the various\r\n    ingredients were macerated in oil, brine, and vinegar, with\r\n    which they were often impregnated drop by drop. Meat, also,\r\n    after having been cut into very small pieces, was treated in the\r\n    same manner.\r\n\r\nITALIAN SAUCE (Brown).\r\n\r\n453. INGREDIENTS.--A few chopped mushrooms and shalots, 1/2 pint of\r\nstock, No. 105, 1/2 glass of Madeira, the juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of pounded sugar, 1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the stock into a stewpan with the mushrooms, shalots, and\r\nMadeira, and stew gently for 1/4 hour, then add the remaining\r\ningredients, and let them just boil. When the sauce is done enough, put\r\nit in another stewpan, and warm it in a _bain marie_. (_See_ No. 430.)\r\nThe mushrooms should not be chopped long before they are wanted, as they\r\nwill then become black.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour. _Average cost_, for this quantity, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a small dish.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN SAUCE (White).\r\n\r\n454. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of white stock, No. 107; 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\nchopped mushrooms, 1 dessertspoonful of chopped shalots, 1 slice of ham,\r\nminced very fine; 1/4 pint of Béchamel, No. 367; salt to taste, a few\r\ndrops of garlic vinegar, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, a squeeze of\r\nlemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the shalots and mushrooms into a stewpan with the stock and\r\nham, and simmer very gently for 1/2 hour, when add the Béchamel. Let it\r\njust boil up, and then strain it through a tammy; season with the above\r\ningredients, and serve very hot. If this sauce should not have retained\r\na nice white colour, a little cream may be added.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, for this quantity, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a moderate-sized dish.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--To preserve the colour of the mushrooms after pickling, throw\r\nthem into water to which a little lemon-juice has been added.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PICKLE LEMONS WITH THE PEEL ON.\r\n\r\n455. INGREDIENTS.--6 lemons, 2 quarts of boiling water; to each quart of\r\nvinegar allow 1/2 oz. of cloves, 1/2 oz. of white pepper, 1 oz. of\r\nbruised ginger, 1/4 oz. of mace and chilies, 1 oz. of mustard-seed, 1/2\r\nstick of sliced horseradish, a few cloves of garlic.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the lemons into a brine that will bear an egg; let them\r\nremain in it 6 days, stirring them every day; have ready 2 quarts of\r\nboiling water, put in the lemons, and allow them to boil for 1/4 hour;\r\ntake them out, and let them lie in a cloth until perfectly dry and cold.\r\nBoil up sufficient vinegar to cover the lemons, with all the above\r\ningredients, allowing the same proportion as stated to each quart of\r\nvinegar. Pack the lemons in a jar, pour over the vinegar, &c. boiling\r\nhot, and tie down with a bladder. They will be fit for use in about 12\r\nmonths, or rather sooner.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This should be made from November to April.\r\n\r\n    THE LEMON.--In the earlier ages of the world, the lemon does not\r\n    appear to have been at all known, and the Romans only became\r\n    acquainted with it at a very late period, and then only used it\r\n    to keep moths from their garments. Its acidity would seem to\r\n    have been unpleasant to them; and in Pliny's time, at the\r\n    commencement of the Christian era, this fruit was hardly\r\n    accepted, otherwise than as an excellent antidote against the\r\n    effects of poison. Many anecdotes have been related concerning\r\n    the anti-venomous properties of the lemon; Athenaeus, a Latin\r\n    writer, telling us, that on one occasion, two men felt no\r\n    effects from the bites of dangerous serpents, because they had\r\n    previously eaten of this fruit.\r\n\r\nTO PICKLE LEMONS WITHOUT THE PEEL.\r\n\r\n456. INGREDIENTS.--6 lemons, 1 lb. of fine salt; to each quart of\r\nvinegar, the same ingredients as No. 455.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the lemons, slit each one down 3 times, so as not to\r\ndivide them, and rub the salt well into the divisions; place them in a\r\npan, where they must remain for a week, turning them every other day;\r\nthen put them in a Dutch oven before a clear fire until the salt has\r\nbecome perfectly dry; then arrange them in a jar. Pour over sufficient\r\nboiling vinegar to cover them, to which have been added the ingredients\r\nmentioned in the foregoing recipe; tie down closely, and in about 9\r\nmonths they will be fit for use.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--The best time to make this is from November to April.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--After this pickle has been made from 4 to 5 months, the liquor\r\nmay be strained and bottled, and will be found an excellent lemon\r\nketchup.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LEMON-JUICE.--Citric acid is the principal component part of\r\n    lemon-juice, which, in addition to the agreeableness of its\r\n    flavour, is also particularly cooling and grateful. It is\r\n    likewise an antiscorbutic; and this quality enhances its value.\r\n    In order to combat the fatal effects of scurvy amongst the crews\r\n    of ships at sea, a regular allowance of lemon-juice is served\r\n    out to the men; and by this practice, the disease has almost\r\n    entirely disappeared. By putting the juice into bottles, and\r\n    pouring on the top sufficient oil to cover it, it may be\r\n    preserved for a considerable time. Italy and Turkey export great\r\n    quantities of it in this manner.\r\n\r\nLEMON SAUCE FOR BOILED FOWLS.\r\n\r\n457. INGREDIENTS.--1 small lemon, 3/4 pint of melted butter, No. 380.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the lemon into very thin slices, and these again into very\r\nsmall dice. Have ready 3/4 pint of melted butter, made by recipe No.\r\n380; put in the lemon; let it just simmer, but not boil, and pour it\r\nover the fowls.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 minute to simmer. _Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a pair of large fowls.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON WHITE SAUCE, FOR FOWLS, FRICASSEES, &c.\r\n\r\n458. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 pint of cream, the rind and juice of 1 lemon, 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of whole white pepper, 1 sprig of lemon thyme, 3 oz. of\r\nbutter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1 teacupful of white stock; salt to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the cream into a very clean saucepan (a lined one is best),\r\nwith the lemon-peel, pepper, and thyme, and let these infuse for 1/2\r\nhour, when simmer gently for a few minutes, or until there is a nice\r\nflavour of lemon. Strain it, and add a thickening of butter and flour in\r\nthe above proportions; stir this well in, and put in the lemon-juice at\r\nthe moment of serving; mix the stock with the cream, and add a little\r\nsalt. This sauce should not boil after the cream and stock are mixed\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, this quantity, for a pair of large boiled fowls.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Where the expense of the cream is objected to, milk may be\r\nsubstituted for it. In this case, an additional dessertspoonful, or\r\nrather more, of flour must be added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEMON THYME.]\r\n\r\n    LEMON THYME.--Two or three tufts of this species of thyme,\r\n    _Thymus citriodorus_, usually find a place in the herb\r\n    compartment of the kitchen-garden. It is a trailing evergreen,\r\n    is of smaller growth than the common kind (_see_ No. 166), and\r\n    is remarkable for its smell, which closely resembles that of the\r\n    rind of a lemon. Hence its distinctive name. It is used for some\r\n    particular dishes, in which the fragrance of the lemon is\r\n    desired to slightly predominate.\r\n\r\nLEAMINGTON SAUCE (an Excellent Sauce for Flavouring Gravies, Hashes,\r\nSoups, &c.).\r\n\r\n_(Author's Recipe.)_\r\n\r\n459. INGREDIENTS.--Walnuts. To each quart of walnut-juice allow 3 quarts\r\nof vinegar, 1 pint of Indian soy, 1 oz. of cayenne, 2 oz. of shalots,\r\n3/4 oz. of garlic, 1/2 pint of port wine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Be very particular in choosing the walnuts as soon as they\r\nappear in the market; for they are more easily bruised before they\r\nbecome hard and shelled. Pound them in a mortar to a pulp, strew some\r\nsalt over them, and let them remain thus for two or three days,\r\noccasionally stirring and moving them about. Press out the juice, and to\r\n_each quart_ of walnut-liquor allow the above proportion of vinegar,\r\nsoy, cayenne, shalots, garlic, and port wine. Pound each ingredient\r\nseparately in a mortar, then mix them well together, and store away for\r\nuse in small bottles. The corks should be well sealed.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This sauce should be made as soon as walnuts are\r\nobtainable, from the beginning to the middle of July.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON BRANDY.\r\n\r\n460. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of brandy, the rind of two small lemons, 2 oz.\r\nof loaf-sugar, 1/4 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the lemons rather thin, taking care to have none of the\r\nwhite pith. Put the rinds into a bottle with the brandy, and let them\r\ninfuse for 24 hours, when they should be strained. Now boil the sugar\r\nwith the water for a few minutes, skim it, and, when cold, add it to the\r\nbrandy. A dessertspoonful of this will be found an excellent flavouring\r\nfor boiled custards.\r\n\r\n    LEMON RIND OR PEEL.--This contains an essential oil of a very\r\n    high flavour and fragrance, and is consequently esteemed both a\r\n    wholesome and agreeable stomachic. It is used, as will be seen\r\n    by many recipes in this book, as an ingredient for flavouring a\r\n    number of various dishes. Under the name of CANDIED LEMON-PEEL,\r\n    it is cleared of the pulp and preserved by sugar, when it\r\n    becomes an excellent sweetmeat. By the ancient medical\r\n    philosopher Galen, and others, it may be added, that dried\r\n    lemon-peel was considered as one of the best digestives, and\r\n    recommended to weak and delicate persons.\r\n\r\nLIAISON OF EGGS FOR THICKENING SAUCES.\r\n\r\n461. INGREDIENTS.--The yolks of 3 eggs, 8 tablespoonfuls of milk or\r\ncream.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat up the yolks of the eggs, to which add the milk, and\r\nstrain the whole through a hair-sieve. When the liaison is being added\r\nto the sauce it is intended to thicken, care must be exercised to keep\r\nstirring it during the whole time, or, otherwise, the eggs will curdle.\r\nIt should only just simmer, but not boil.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVER AND LEMON SAUCE FOR POULTRY.\r\n\r\n462. INGREDIENTS.--The liver of a fowl, one lemon, salt to taste, 1/2\r\npint of melted butter. No. 376.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the liver, and let it boil for a few minutes; peel the\r\nlemon very thin, remove the white part and pips, and cut it into very\r\nsmall dice; mince the liver and a small quantity of the lemon rind very\r\nfine; add these ingredients to 1/2 pint of smoothly-made melted butter;\r\nseason with a little salt, put in the cut lemon, heat it gradually, but\r\ndo not allow it to boil, lest the butter should oil.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 minute to simmer.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to serve with a pair of small fowls.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVER AND PARSLEY SAUCE FOR POULTRY.\r\n\r\n463. INGREDIENTS.--The liver of a fowl, one tablespoonful of minced\r\nparsley, 1/2 pint of melted butter, No. 376.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash and score the liver, boil it for a few minutes, and mince\r\nit very fine; blanch or scald a small bunch of parsley, of which there\r\nshould be sufficient when chopped to fill a tablespoon; add this, with\r\nthe minced liver, to 1/2 pint of smoothly-made melted butter; let it\r\njust boil; when serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 minute to simmer.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a pair of small fowls.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOBSTER SAUCE, to serve with Turbot, Salmon, Brill, &c.\r\n\r\n(_Very Good_.)\r\n\r\n464. INGREDIENTS.--1 middling-sized hen lobster, 3/4 pint of melted\r\nbutter, No. 376; 1 tablespoonful of anchovy sauce, 1/2 oz. of butter,\r\nsalt and cayenne to taste, a little pounded mace when liked, 2 or 3\r\ntablespoonfuls of cream.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose a hen lobster, as this is indispensable, in order to\r\nrender this sauce as good as it ought to be. Pick the meat from the\r\nshells, and cut it into small square pieces; put the spawn, which will\r\nbe found under the tail of the lobster, into a mortar with 1/2 oz. of\r\nbutter, and pound it quite smooth; rub it through a hair-sieve, and\r\ncover up till wanted. Make 3/4 pint of melted butter by recipe No. 376;\r\nput in all the ingredients except the lobster-meat, and well mix the\r\nsauce before the lobster is added to it, as it should retain its square\r\nform, and not come to table shredded and ragged. Put in the meat, let it\r\nget thoroughly hot, but do not allow it to boil, as the colour would\r\nimmediately be spoiled; for it should be remembered that this sauce\r\nshould always have a bright red appearance. If it is intended to be\r\nserved with turbot or brill, a little of the spawn (dried and rubbed\r\nthrough a sieve without butter) should be saved to garnish with; but as\r\nthe goodness, flavour, and appearance of the sauce so much depend on\r\nhaving a proper quantity of spawn, the less used for garnishing the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 minute to simmer. _Average cost_, for this quantity, 2s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to serve with a small turbot, a brill, or salmon for 6\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Melted butter made with milk, No. 380, will be found to answer\r\nvery well for lobster sauce, as by employing it a nice white colour will\r\nbe obtained. Less quantity than the above may be made by using a very\r\nsmall lobster, to which add only 1/2 pint of melted butter, and season\r\nas above. Where economy is desired, the cream may be dispensed with, and\r\nthe remains of a cold lobster left from table, may, with a little care,\r\nbe converted into a very good sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAITRE D'HOTEL BUTTER, for putting into Broiled Fish just before it is\r\nsent to Table.\r\n\r\n465. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of butter, 2 dessertspoonfuls of minced\r\nparsley, salt and pepper to taste, the juice of 1 large lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Work the above ingredients well together, and let them be\r\nthoroughly mixed with a wooden spoon. If this is used as a sauce, it may\r\nbe poured either under or over the meat or fish it is intended to be\r\nserved with.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 5d.\r\n\r\nNote.--4 tablespoonfuls of Béchamel, No. 367, 2 do. of white stock, No.\r\n107, with 2 oz. of the above maître d'hôtel butter stirred into it, and\r\njust allowed to simmer for 1 minute, will be found an excellent hot\r\nmaître d'hôtel sauce.\r\n\r\n    THE MAÎTRE D'HÔTEL.--The house-steward of England is synonymous\r\n    with the maître d'hôtel of France; and, in ancient times,\r\n    amongst the Latins, he was called procurator, or major-domo. In\r\n    Rome, the slaves, after they had procured the various articles\r\n    necessary for the repasts of the day, would return to the\r\n    spacious kitchen laden with meat, game, sea-fish, vegetables,\r\n    fruit, &c. Each one would then lay his basket at the feet of the\r\n    major-domo, who would examine its contents and register them on\r\n    his tablets, placing in the pantry contiguous to the\r\n    dining-room, those of the provisions which need no preparation,\r\n    and consigning the others to the more immediate care of the\r\n    cooks.\r\n\r\nMAITRE D'HOTEL SAUCE (HOT), to serve with Calf's Head, Boiled Eels, and\r\ndifferent Fish.\r\n\r\n466. INGREDIENTS.--1 slice of minced ham, a few poultry-trimmings, 2\r\nshalots, 1 clove of garlic, 1 bay-leaf, 3/4 pint of water, 2 oz. of\r\nbutter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1 heaped tablespoonful of chopped\r\nparsley; salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste; the juice of 1/2 large\r\nlemon, 1/4 teaspoonful of pounded sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put at the bottom of a stewpan the minced ham, and over it the\r\npoultry-trimmings (if these are not at hand, veal should be\r\nsubstituted), with the shalots, garlic, and bay-leaf. Pour in the water,\r\nand let the whole simmer gently for 1 hour, or until the liquor is\r\nreduced to a full 1/2 pint. Then strain this gravy, put it in another\r\nsaucepan, make a thickening of butter and flour in the above\r\nproportions, and stir it to the gravy over a nice clear fire, until it\r\nis perfectly smooth and rather thick, care being taken that the butter\r\ndoes not float on the surface. Skim well, add the remaining ingredients,\r\nlet the sauce gradually heat, but do not allow it to boil. If this sauce\r\nis intended for an entrée, it is necessary to make it of a sufficient\r\nthickness, so that it may adhere to what it is meant to cover.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 2d. per pint.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for re-warming the remains of 1/2 calf's head, or a small\r\ndish of cold flaked turbot, cod, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIGRE MAITRE D'HOTEL SAUCE (HOT).\r\n\r\n(Made without Meat.)\r\n\r\n467. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of melted butter, No. 376; 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of chopped parsley, salt and pepper to taste, the juice of\r\n1/2 large lemon; when liked, 2 minced shalots.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make 1/2 pint of melted butter, by recipe No. 376; stir in the\r\nabove ingredients, and let them just boil; when it is ready to serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 minute to simmer. _Average cost_, 9d. per pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYONNAISE, a Sauce or Salad-Dressing for cold Chicken, Meat, and other\r\ncold Dishes.\r\n\r\n468. INGREDIENTS.--The yolks of 2 eggs, 6 tablespoonfuls of salad-oil, 4\r\ntablespoonfuls of vinegar, salt and white pepper to taste, 1\r\ntablespoonful of white stock, No. 107, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the yolks of the eggs into a basin, with a seasoning of\r\npepper and salt; have ready the above quantities of oil and vinegar, in\r\nseparate vessels; add them _very gradually_ to the eggs; continue\r\nstirring and rubbing the mixture with a wooden spoon, as herein consists\r\nthe secret of having a nice smooth sauce. It cannot be stirred too\r\nfrequently, and it should be made in a very cool place, or, if ice is at\r\nhand, it should be mixed over it. When the vinegar and oil are well\r\nincorporated with the eggs, add the stock and cream, stirring all the\r\ntime, and it will then be ready for use.\r\n\r\nFor a fish Mayonnaise, this sauce may be coloured with lobster-spawn,\r\npounded; and for poultry or meat, where variety is desired, a little\r\nparsley-juice may be used to add to its appearance. Cucumber, Tarragon,\r\nor any other flavoured vinegar, may be substituted for plain, where they\r\nare liked.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a small salad.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--In mixing the oil and vinegar with the eggs, put in first a few\r\ndrops of oil, and then a few drops of vinegar, never adding a large\r\nquantity of either at one time. By this means, you can be more certain\r\nof the sauce not curdling. Patience and practice, let us add, are two\r\nessentials for making this sauce good.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINT SAUCE, to serve with Roast Lamb.\r\n\r\n469. INGREDIENTS.--4 dessertspoonfuls of chopped mint, 2\r\ndessertspoonfuls of pounded white sugar, 1/4 pint of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the mint, which should be young and fresh-gathered, free\r\nfrom grit; pick the leaves from the stalks, mince them very fine, and\r\nput them into a tureen; add the sugar and vinegar, and stir till the\r\nformer is dissolved. This sauce is better by being made 2 or 3 hours\r\nbefore wanted for table, as the vinegar then becomes impregnated with\r\nthe flavour of the mint. By many persons, the above proportion of sugar\r\nwould not be considered sufficient; but as tastes vary, we have given\r\nthe quantity which we have found to suit the general palate.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to serve with a middling-sized joint of lamb.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Where green mint is scarce and not obtainable, mint vinegar may\r\nbe substituted for it, and will be found very acceptable in early\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINT.]\r\n\r\n    MINT.--The common mint cultivated in our gardens is known as the\r\n    _Mentha viridis_, and is employed in different culinary\r\n    processes, being sometimes boiled with certain dishes, and\r\n    afterwards withdrawn. It has an agreeable aromatic flavour, and\r\n    forms an ingredient in soups, and sometimes is used in spring\r\n    salads. It is valuable as a stomachic and antispasmodic; on\r\n    which account it is generally served at table with pea-soup.\r\n    Several of its species grow wild in low situations in the\r\n    country.\r\n\r\nMINT VINEGAR.\r\n\r\n470. INGREDIENTS.--Vinegar, mint.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure some nice fresh mint, pick the leaves from the stalks,\r\nand fill a bottle or jar with them. Add vinegar to them until the bottle\r\nis full; _cover closely_ to exclude the air, and let it infuse for a\r\nfortnight. Then strain the liquor, and put it into small bottles for\r\nuse, of which the corks should be sealed.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This should be made in June, July, or August.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIXED PICKLE.\r\n\r\n(_Very Good_.)\r\n\r\n471. INGREDIENTS.--To each gallon of vinegar allow 1/4 lb. of bruised\r\nginger, 1/4 lb. of mustard, 1/4 lb. of salt, 2 oz. of mustard-seed,\r\n1-1/2 oz. of turmeric, 1 oz. of ground black pepper, 1/4 oz. of cayenne,\r\ncauliflowers, onions, celery, sliced cucumbers, gherkins, French beans,\r\nnasturtiums, capsicums.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have a large jar, with a tightly-fitting lid, in which put as\r\nmuch vinegar as required, reserving a little to mix the various powders\r\nto a smooth paste. Put into a basin the mustard, turmeric, pepper, and\r\ncayenne; mix them with vinegar, and stir well until no lumps remain; add\r\nall the ingredients to the vinegar, and mix well. Keep this liquor in a\r\nwarm place, and thoroughly stir every morning for a month with a wooden\r\nspoon, when it will be ready for the different vegetables to be added to\r\nit. As these come into season, have them gathered on a dry day, and,\r\nafter merely wiping them with a cloth, to free them from moisture, put\r\nthem into the pickle. The cauliflowers, it may be said, must be divided\r\ninto small bunches. Put all these into the pickle raw, and at the end of\r\nthe season, when there have been added as many of the vegetables as\r\ncould be procured, store it away in jars, and tie over with bladder. As\r\nnone of the ingredients are boiled, this pickle will not be fit to eat\r\ntill 12 months have elapsed. Whilst the pickle is being made, keep a\r\nwooden spoon tied to the jar; and its contents, it may be repeated, must\r\nbe stirred every morning.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make the pickle-liquor in May or June, as the season\r\narrives for the various vegetables to be picked.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM KETCHUP.\r\n\r\n472. INGREDIENTS.--To each peck of mushrooms 1/2 lb. of salt; to each\r\nquart of mushroom-liquor 1/4 oz. of cayenne, 1/2 oz. of allspice, 1/2\r\noz. of ginger, 2 blades of pounded mace.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose full-grown mushroom-flaps, and take care they are\r\nperfectly _fresh-gathered_ when the weather is tolerably dry; for, if\r\nthey are picked during very heavy rain, the ketchup from which they are\r\nmade is liable to get musty, and will not keep long. Put a layer of them\r\nin a deep pan, sprinkle salt over them, and then another layer of\r\nmushrooms, and so on alternately. Let them remain for a few hours, when\r\nbreak them up with the hand; put them in a nice cool place for 3 days,\r\noccasionally stirring and mashing them well, to extract from them as\r\nmuch juice as possible. Now measure the quantity of liquor without\r\nstraining, and to each quart allow the above proportion of spices, &c.\r\nPut all into a stone jar, cover it up very closely, put it in a saucepan\r\nof boiling water, set it over the fire, and let it boil for 3 hours.\r\nHave ready a nice clean stewpan; turn into it the contents of the jar,\r\nand let the whole simmer very gently for 1/2 hour; pour it into a jug,\r\nwhere it should stand in a cool place till the next day; then pour it\r\noff into another jug, and strain it into very dry clean bottles, and do\r\nnot squeeze the mushrooms. To each pint of ketchup add a few drops of\r\nbrandy. Be careful not to shake the contents, but leave all the sediment\r\nbehind in the jug; cork well, and either seal or rosin the cork, so as\r\nperfectly to exclude the air. When a very clear bright ketchup is\r\nwanted, the liquor must be strained through a very fine hair-sieve, or\r\nflannel bag, _after_ it has been very gently poured off; if the\r\noperation is not successful, it must be repeated until you have quite a\r\nclear liquor. It should be examined occasionally, and if it is spoiling,\r\nshould be reboiled with a few peppercorns.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the beginning of September to the middle of October,\r\nwhen this ketchup should be made.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This flavouring ingredient, if genuine and well prepared, is\r\none of the most useful store sauces to the experienced cook, and no\r\ntrouble should be spared in its preparation. Double ketchup is made by\r\nreducing the liquor to half the quantity; for example, 1 quart must be\r\nboiled down to 1 pint. This goes farther than ordinary ketchup, as so\r\nlittle is required to flavour a good quantity of gravy. The sediment may\r\nalso be bottled for immediate use, and will be found to answer for\r\nflavouring thick soups or gravies.\r\n\r\n    HOW TO DISTINGUISH MUSHROOMS FROM TOADSTOOLS.--The cultivated\r\n    mushroom, known as _Agaricus campestris_, may be distinguished\r\n    from other poisonous kinds of fungi by its having pink or\r\n    flesh-coloured gills, or under-side, and by its invariably\r\n    having an agreeable smell, which the toadstool has not. When\r\n    young, mushrooms are like a small round button, both the stalk\r\n    and head being white. As they grow larger, they expand their\r\n    heads by degrees into a flat form, the gills underneath being at\r\n    first of a pale flesh-colour, but becoming, as they stand\r\n    longer, dark brown or blackish. Nearly all the poisonous kinds\r\n    are brown, and have in general a rank and putrid smell. Edible\r\n    mushrooms are found in closely-fed pastures, but seldom grow in\r\n    woods, where most of the poisonous sorts are to be found.\r\n\r\nTO DRY MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n473. _Mode_.--Wipe them clean, take away the brown part, and peel off\r\nthe skin; lay them on sheets of paper to dry, in a cool oven, when they\r\nwill shrivel considerably. Keep them in paper bags, which hang in a dry\r\nplace. When wanted for use, put them into cold gravy, bring them\r\ngradually to simmer, and it will be found that they will regain nearly\r\ntheir usual size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MUSHROOM.]\r\n\r\n    THE MUSHROOM.--The cultivated or garden mushroom is a species of\r\n    fungus, which, in England, is considered the best, and is there\r\n    usually eaten. The tribe, however, is numerous, and a large\r\n    proportion of them are poisonous; hence it is always dangerous\r\n    to make use of mushrooms gathered in their wild state. In some\r\n    parts of Europe, as in Germany, Russia, and Poland, many species\r\n    grow wild, and are used as food; but in Britain, two only are\r\n    generally eaten. These are mostly employed for the flavouring of\r\n    dishes, and are also dried and pickled. CATSUP, or KETCHUP, is\r\n    made from them by mixing spices and salt with their juice. The\r\n    young, called buttons, are the best for pickling when in the\r\n    globular form.\r\n\r\nBROWN MUSHROOM SAUCE, to serve with Roast Meat, &c.\r\n\r\n474. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of button mushrooms, 1/2 pint of good beef\r\ngravy, No. 435, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup (if at hand),\r\nthickening of butter and flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the gravy into a saucepan, thicken it, and stir over the\r\nfire until it boils. Prepare the mushrooms by cutting off the stalks and\r\nwiping them free from grit and dirt; the large flap mushrooms cut into\r\nsmall pieces will answer for a brown sauce, when the buttons are not\r\nobtainable; put them into the gravy, and let them simmer very gently for\r\nabout 10 minutes; then add the ketchup, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to October.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--When fresh mushrooms are not obtainable, the powder No. 477 may\r\nbe used as a substitute for brown sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE MUSHROOM SAUCE, to serve with Boiled Fowls, Cutlets, &c.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n475. INGREDIENTS.--Rather more than 1/2 pint of button mushrooms,\r\nlemon-juice and water, 1 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint of Béchamel, No. 367,\r\n1/4 teaspoonful of pounded sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Turn the mushrooms white by putting them into lemon-juice and\r\nwater, having previously cut off the stalks and wiped them perfectly\r\nfree from grit. Chop them, and put them in a stewpan with the butter.\r\nWhen the mushrooms are softened, add the Béchamel, and simmer for about\r\n5 minutes; should they, however, not be done enough, allow rather more\r\ntime. They should not boil longer than necessary, as they would then\r\nlose their colour and flavour. Rub the whole through a tammy, and serve\r\nvery hot. After this, it should be warmed in a bain marie.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1/4 hour. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_A More Simple Method_.\r\n\r\n476. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of melted butter, made with milk, No. 380;\r\n1/2 pint of button mushrooms, 1 dessertspoonful of mushroom ketchup, if\r\nat hand; cayenne and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the melted butter by recipe No. 380, and add to it the\r\nmushrooms, which must be nicely cleaned, and free from grit, and the\r\nstalks cut off. Let them simmer gently for about 10 minutes, or until\r\nthey are quite tender. Put in the seasoning and ketchup; let it just\r\nboil, when serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 10 minutes. _Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to October.\r\n\r\n    GROWTH OF THE MUSHROOM AND OTHER FUNGI.--The quick growth of the\r\n    mushroom and other fungi is no less wonderful than the length of\r\n    time they live, and the numerous dangers they resist while they\r\n    continue in the dormant state. To spring up \"like a mushroom in\r\n    a night\" is a scriptural mode of expressing celerity; and this\r\n    completely accords with all the observations which have been\r\n    made concerning this curious class of plants. Mr. Sowerby\r\n    remarks--\"I have often placed specimens of the _Phallus caninus_\r\n    by a window over-night, while in the egg-form, and they have\r\n    been fully grown by the morning.\"\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM POWDER (a valuable addition to Sauces and Gravies, when fresh\r\nMushrooms are not obtainable).\r\n\r\n477. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 peck of large mushrooms, 2 onions, 12 cloves, 1/4\r\noz. of pounded mace, 2 teaspoonfuls of white pepper.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the mushrooms, wipe them perfectly free from grit and\r\ndirt, remove the black fur, and reject all those that are at all\r\nworm-eaten; put them into a stewpan with the above ingredients, but\r\nwithout water; shake them over a clear fire, till all the liquor is\r\ndried up, and be careful not to let them burn; arrange them on tins, and\r\ndry them in a slow oven; pound them to a fine powder, which put into\r\nsmall _dry_ bottles; cork well, seal the corks, and keep it in a dry\r\nplace. In using this powder, add it to the gravy just before serving,\r\nwhen it will merely require one boil-up. The flavour imparted by this\r\nmeans to the gravy, ought to be exceedingly good.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This should be made in September, or at the beginning of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--If the bottles in which it is stored away are not perfectly\r\ndry, as, also the mushroom powder, it will keep good but a very short\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLED MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n478. INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient vinegar to cover the mushrooms; to each\r\nquart of mushrooms, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1 oz. of ground pepper,\r\nsalt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose some nice young button mushrooms for pickling, and rub\r\noff the skin with a piece of flannel and salt, and cut off the stalks;\r\nif very large, take out the red inside, and reject the black ones, as\r\nthey are too old. Put them in a stewpan, sprinkle salt over them, with\r\npounded mace and pepper in the above proportion; shake them well over a\r\nclear fire until the liquor flows, and keep them there until it is all\r\ndried up again; then add as much vinegar as will cover them; just let it\r\nsimmer for 1 minute, and store it away in stone jars for use. When cold,\r\ntie down with bladder and keep in a dry place; they will remain good for\r\na length of time, and are generally considered delicious.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this the same time as ketchup, from the beginning of\r\nSeptember to the middle of October.\r\n\r\n    NATURE OF THE MUSHROOM.--Locality has evidently a considerable\r\n    influence on the nature of the juices of the mushroom; for it\r\n    has been discovered, after fatal experience, that some species,\r\n    which are perfectly harmless when raised in open meadows and\r\n    pasturelands, become virulently poisonous when they happen to\r\n    grow in contact with stagnant water or putrescent animal and\r\n    vegetable substances. What the precise nature of the poison in\r\n    fungi may be, has not been accurately ascertained.\r\n\r\nA VERY RICH AND GOOD MUSHROOM SAUCE, to serve with Fowls or Rabbits.\r\n\r\n479. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of mushroom-buttons, salt to taste, a little\r\ngrated nutmeg, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 pint of cream, 2 oz. of\r\nbutter, flour to thicken.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the buttons with a piece of flannel and salt, to take off\r\nthe skin; cut off the stalks, and put them in a stewpan with the above\r\ningredients, previously kneading together the butter and flour; boil the\r\nwhole for about ten minutes, stirring all the time. Pour some of the\r\nsauce over the fowls, and the remainder serve in a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes. _Average cost_, 2s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to serve with a pair of fowls.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MIX MUSTARD.\r\n\r\n480. INGREDIENTS.--Mustard, salt, and water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mustard should be mixed with water that has been boiled and\r\nallowed to cool; hot water destroys its essential properties, and raw\r\ncold water might cause it to ferment. Put the mustard in a cup, with a\r\nsmall pinch of salt, and mix with it very gradually sufficient boiled\r\nwater to make it drop from the spoon without being watery. Stir and mix\r\nwell, and rub the lumps well down with the back of a spoon, as\r\nwell-mixed mustard should be perfectly free from these. The mustard-pot\r\nshould not be more than half full, or rather less if it will not be used\r\nin a day or two, as it is so much better when freshly mixed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTARTAR MUSTARD.\r\n\r\n481. INGREDIENTS.--Horseradish vinegar, cayenne, 1/2 a teacupful of\r\nmustard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have ready sufficient horseradish vinegar to mix with the above\r\nproportion of mustard; put the mustard in a cup, with a slight seasoning\r\nof cayenne; mix it perfectly smooth with the vinegar, adding this a\r\nlittle at a time; rub down with the back of a spoon any lumps that may\r\nappear, and do not let it be too thin. Mustard may be flavoured in\r\nvarious ways, with Tarragon, shalot, celery, and many other vinegars,\r\nherbs, spices, &c.; but this is more customary in France than in\r\nEngland, as there it is merely considered a \"vehicle of flavours,\" as it\r\nhas been termed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLED NASTURTIUMS (a very good Substitute for Capers)\r\n\r\n482. INGREDIENTS.--To each pint of vinegar, 1 oz. of salt, 6\r\npeppercorns, nasturtiums.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Gather the nasturtium-pods on a dry day, and wipe them clean\r\nwith a cloth; put them in a dry glass bottle, with vinegar, salt, and\r\npepper in the above proportion. If you cannot find enough ripe to fill a\r\nbottle, cork up what you have got until you have some more fit: they may\r\nbe added from day to day. Bung up the bottles, and seal or rosin the\r\ntops. They will be fit for use in 10 or 12 months; and the best way is\r\nto make them one season for the next.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Look for nasturtium-pods from the end of July to the end\r\nof August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NASTURTIUMS.]\r\n\r\n    NASTURTIUMS.--The elegant nasturtium-plant, called by\r\n    naturalists _Tropoeolum_, and which sometimes goes by the name\r\n    of Indian cress, came originally from Peru, but was easily made\r\n    to grow in these islands. Its young leaves and flowers are of a\r\n    slightly hot nature, and many consider them a good adjunct to\r\n    salads, to which they certainly add a pretty appearance. When\r\n    the beautiful blossoms, which may be employed with great effect\r\n    in garnishing dishes, are off, then the fruit is used as\r\n    described in the above recipe.\r\n\r\nFRENCH ONION SAUCE, or SOUBISE.\r\n\r\n483. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of Béchamel, No. 367, 1 bay-leaf, seasoning\r\nto taste of pounded mace and cayenne, 6 onions, a small piece of ham.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the onions and cut them in halves; put them in a stewpan,\r\nwith just sufficient water to cover them, and add the bay-leaf, ham,\r\ncayenne, and mace; be careful to keep the lid closely shut, and simmer\r\nthem until tender. Take them out and drain thoroughly; rub them through\r\na tammy or sieve (an old one does for the purpose) with a wooden spoon,\r\nand put them to 1/2 pint of Béchamel; keep stirring over the fire until\r\nit boils, when serve. If it should require any more seasoning, add it to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour to boil the onions.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. for this quantity.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a moderate-sized dish.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE ONION SAUCE, for Boiled Rabbits, Roast Shoulder of Mutton, &c.\r\n\r\n484. INGREDIENTS.--9 large onions, or 12 middling-sized ones, 1 pint of\r\nmelted butter made with milk (No. 380), 1/2 teaspoonful of salt, or\r\nrather more.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the onions and put them into water to which a little salt\r\nhas been added, to preserve their whiteness, and let them remain for 1/4\r\nhour. Then put them in a stewpan, cover them with water, and let them\r\nboil until tender, and, if the onions should be very strong, change the\r\nwater after they have been boiling for 1/4 hour. Drain them thoroughly,\r\nchop them, and rub them through a tammy or sieve. Make 1 pint of melted\r\nbutter, by recipe No. 380, and when that boils, put in the onions, with\r\na seasoning of salt; stir it till it simmers, when it will be ready to\r\nserve. If these directions are carefully attended to, this onion sauce\r\nwill be delicious.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 3/4 to 1 hour, to boil the onions.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d. per pint.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to serve with a roast shoulder of mutton, or boiled rabbit.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--To make this sauce very mild and delicate, use Spanish onions,\r\nwhich can be procured from the beginning of September to Christmas. 2 or\r\n3 tablespoonfuls of cream added just before serving, will be found to\r\nimprove its appearance very much. Small onions, when very young, may be\r\ncooked whole, and served in melted butter. A sieve or tammy should be\r\nkept expressly for onions: an old one answers the purpose, as it is\r\nliable to retain the flavour and smell, which of course would be\r\nexcessively disagreeable in delicate preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN ONION SAUCE.\r\n\r\n485. INGREDIENTS.--6 large onions, rather more than 1/2 pint of good\r\ngravy, 2 oz. of butter, salt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice and fry the onions of a pale brown in a stewpan, with the\r\nabove quantity of butter, keeping them well stirred, that they do not\r\nget black. When a nice colour, pour over the gravy, and let them simmer\r\ngently until tender. Now skim off every particle of fat, add the\r\nseasoning, and rub the whole through a tammy or sieve; put it back in\r\nthe saucepan to warm, and when it boils, serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Where a very high flavouring is liked, add 1 tablespoonful of\r\nmushroom ketchup, or a small quantity of port wine.\r\n\r\n    HISTORY OF THE ONION.--It is not supposed that any variety of\r\n    the onion is indigenous to Britain, as when the large and mild\r\n    roots imported from warmer climates, have been cultivated in\r\n    these islands a few years, they deteriorate both in size and\r\n    sweetness. It is therefore most likely that this plant was first\r\n    introduced into England from continental Europe, and that it\r\n    originally was produced in a southern climate, and has gradually\r\n    become acclimatized to a colder atmosphere. (_See_ No. 139.)\r\n\r\nPICKLED ONIONS (a very Simple Method, and exceedingly Good).\r\n\r\n486. INGREDIENTS.--Pickling onions; to each quart of vinegar, 2\r\nteaspoonfuls of allspice, 2 teaspoonfuls of whole black pepper.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the onions gathered when quite dry and ripe, and, with the\r\nfingers, take off the thin outside skin; then, with a silver knife\r\n(steel should not be used, as it spoils the colour of the onions),\r\nremove one more skin, when the onion will look quite clear. Have ready\r\nsome very dry bottles or jars, and as fast as they are peeled, put them\r\nin. Pour over sufficient cold vinegar to cover them, with pepper and\r\nallspice in the above proportions, taking care that each jar has its\r\nshare of the latter ingredients. Tie down with bladder, and put them in\r\na dry place, and in a fortnight they will be fit for use. This is a most\r\nsimple recipe and very delicious, the onions being nice and crisp. They\r\nshould be eaten within 6 or 8 months after being done, as the onions are\r\nliable to become soft.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the middle of July to the end of August.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLED ONIONS.\r\n\r\n487. INGREDIENTS.--1 gallon of pickling onions, salt and water, milk; to\r\neach 1/2 gallon of vinegar, 1 oz. of bruised ginger, 1/4 teaspoonful of\r\ncayenne, 1 oz. of allspice, 1 oz. of whole black pepper, 1/4 oz. of\r\nwhole nutmeg bruised, 8 cloves, 1/4 oz. of mace.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Gather the onions, which should not be too small, when they are\r\nquite dry and ripe; wipe off the dirt, but do not pare them; make a\r\nstrong solution of salt and water, into which put the onions, and change\r\nthis, morning and night, for 3 days, and save the _last_ brine they were\r\nput in. Then take the outside skin off, and put them into a tin saucepan\r\ncapable of holding them all, as they are always better done together.\r\nNow take equal quantities of milk and the last salt and water the onions\r\nwere in, and pour this to them; to this add 2 large spoonfuls of salt,\r\nput them over the fire, and watch them very attentively. Keep constantly\r\nturning the onions about with a wooden skimmer, those at the bottom to\r\nthe top, and _vice versâ_; and let the milk and water run through the\r\nholes of the skimmer. Remember, the onions must never boil, or, if they\r\ndo, they will be good for nothing; and they should be quite transparent.\r\nKeep the onions stirred for a few minutes, and, in stirring them, be\r\nparticular not to break them. Then have ready a pan with a colander,\r\ninto which turn the onions to drain, covering them with a cloth to keep\r\nin the steam. Place on a table an old cloth, 2 or 3 times double; put\r\nthe onions on it when quite hot, and over them an old piece of blanket;\r\ncover this closely over them, to keep in the steam. Let them remain till\r\nthe next day, when they will be quite cold, and look yellow and\r\nshrivelled; take off the shrivelled skins, when they should be as white\r\nas snow. Put them in a pan, make a pickle of vinegar and the remaining\r\ningredients, boil all these up, and pour hot over the onions in the pan.\r\nCover very closely to keep in all the steam, and let them stand till the\r\nfollowing day, when they will be quite cold. Put them into jars or\r\nbottles well bunged, and a tablespoonful of the best olive-oil on the\r\ntop of each jar or bottle. Tie them down with bladder, and let them\r\nstand in a cool place for a month or six weeks, when they will be fit\r\nfor use. They should be beautifully white, and eat crisp, without the\r\nleast softness, and will keep good many months.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the middle of July to the end of August.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE GRAVY, for Wildfowl, Widgeon, Teal, &c.\r\n\r\n488. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of white stock, No. 107, 1 small onion, 3 or\r\n4 strips of lemon or orange peel, a few leaves of basil, if at hand, the\r\njuice of a Seville orange or lemon, salt and pepper to taste, 1 glass of\r\nport wine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the onion, cut in slices, into a stewpan with the stock,\r\norange-peel, and basil, and let them simmer very gently for 1/4 hour or\r\nrather longer, should the gravy not taste sufficiently of the peel.\r\nStrain it off, and add to the gravy the remaining ingredients; let the\r\nwhole heat through, and, when on the point of boiling, serve very hot in\r\na tureen which should have a cover to it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a small tureen.\r\n\r\n\r\nOYSTER FORCEMEAT, for Roast or Boiled Turkey.\r\n\r\n489. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of bread crumbs, 1-1/2 oz. of chopped suet\r\nor butter, 1 faggot of savoury herbs, 1/4 saltspoonful of grated nutmeg,\r\nsalt and pepper to taste, 2 eggs, 18 oysters.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Grate the bread very fine, and be careful that no large lumps\r\nremain; put it into a basin with the suet, which must be very finely\r\nminced, or, when butter is used, that must be cut up into small pieces.\r\nAdd the herbs, also chopped as small as possible, and seasoning; mix all\r\nthese well together, until the ingredients are thoroughly mingled. Open\r\nand beard the oysters, chop them, but not too small, and add them to the\r\nother ingredients. Beat up the eggs, and, with the hand, work\r\naltogether, until it is smoothly mixed. The turkey should not be stuffed\r\ntoo full: if there should be too much forcemeat, roll it into balls, fry\r\nthem, and use them as a garnish.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\nOYSTER KETCHUP.\r\n\r\n490. INGREDIENTS.--Sufficient oysters to fill a pint measure, 1 pint of\r\nsherry, 3 oz. of salt, 1 drachm of cayenne, 2 drachms of pounded mace.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure the oysters very fresh, and open sufficient to fill a\r\npint measure; save the liquor, and scald the oysters in it with the\r\nsherry; strain the oysters, and put them in a mortar with the salt,\r\ncayenne, and mace; pound the whole until reduced to a pulp, then add it\r\nto the liquor in which they were scalded; boil it again five minutes,\r\nand skim well; rub the whole through a sieve, and, when cold, bottle and\r\ncork closely. The corks should be sealed.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Cider may be substituted for the sherry.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLED OYSTERS.\r\n\r\n491. INGREDIENTS.--100 oysters; to each 1/2 pint of vinegar, 1 blade of\r\npounded mace, 1 strip of lemon-peel, 12 black peppercorns.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Get the oysters in good condition, open them, place them in a\r\nsaucepan, and let them simmer in their own liquor for about 10 minutes,\r\nvery gently; then take them out, one by one, and place them in a jar,\r\nand cover them, when cold, with a pickle made as follows:--Measure the\r\noyster-liquor; add to it the same quantity of vinegar, with mace,\r\nlemon-peel, and pepper in the above proportion, and boil it for 5\r\nminutes; when cold, pour over the oysters, and tie them down very\r\nclosely, as contact with the air spoils them.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Put this pickle away in small jars; because directly one is\r\nopened, its contents should immediately be eaten, as they soon spoil.\r\nThe pickle should not be kept more than 2 or 3 months.\r\n\r\n\r\nOYSTER SAUCE, to serve with Fish, Boiled Poultry, &c.\r\n\r\n492. INGREDIENTS.--3 dozen oysters, 1/2 pint of melted butter, made with\r\nmilk, No. 380.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Open the oysters carefully, and save their liquor; strain it\r\ninto a clean saucepan (a lined one is best), put in the oysters, and let\r\nthem just come to the boiling-point, when they should look plump. Take\r\nthem off the fire immediately, and put the whole into a basin. Strain\r\nthe liquor from them, mix with it sufficient milk to make 1/2 pint\r\naltogether, and follow the directions of No. 380. When the melted butter\r\nis ready and very smooth, put in the oysters, which should be previously\r\nbearded, if you wish the sauce to be really nice. Set it by the side of\r\nthe fire to get thoroughly hot, _but do not allow it to boil_, or the\r\noysters will immediately harden. Using cream instead of milk makes this\r\nsauce extremely delicious. When liked, add a seasoning of cayenne, or\r\nanchovy sauce; but, as we have before stated, a plain sauce _should_ be\r\nplain, and not be overpowered by highly-flavoured essences; therefore we\r\nrecommend that the above directions be implicitly followed, and no\r\nseasoning added.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 2s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons. Never allow fewer than 6 oysters to 1\r\nperson, unless the party is very large.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\nA more economical sauce may be made by using a smaller quantity of\r\noysters, and not bearding them before they are added to the sauce: this\r\nmay answer the purpose, but we cannot undertake to recommend it as a\r\nmode of making this delicious adjunct to fish, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARSLEY AND BUTTER, to serve with Calf's Head. Boiled Fowls, &c.\r\n\r\n493. INGREDIENTS.--2 tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, 1/2 pint of\r\nmelted butter, No. 376.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put into a saucepan a small quantity of water, slightly salted,\r\nand when it boils, throw in a good bunch of parsley which has been\r\npreviously washed and tied together in a bunch; let it boil for 5\r\nminutes, drain it, mince the leaves very fine, and put the above\r\nquantity in a tureen; pour over it 1/2 pint of smoothly-made melted\r\nbutter; stir once, that the ingredients may be thoroughly mixed, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes to boil the parsley. _Average cost_, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 large fowl; allow rather more for a pair.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Sometimes, in the middle of winter, parsley-leaves are not to\r\nbe had, when the following will be found an excellent substitute:--Tie\r\nup a little parsley-seed in a small piece of muslin, and boil it for 10\r\nminutes in a small quantity of water; use this water to make the melted\r\nbutter with, and throw into it a little boiled spinach, minced rather\r\nfine, which will have an appearance similar to that of parsley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARSLEY.]\r\n\r\n    PARSLEY.--If there be nothing new under the sun, there are, at\r\n    any rate, different uses found for the same thing; for this\r\n    pretty aromatic herb was used in ancient times, as we learn from\r\n    mythological narrative, to adorn the head of a hero, no less\r\n    than Hercules; and now--was ever fall so great?--we moderns use\r\n    it in connection with the head of--a calf. According to Homer's\r\n    \"Iliad,\" warriors fed their chariot-steeds on parsley; and Pliny\r\n    acquaints us with the fact that, as a symbol of mourning, it was\r\n    admitted to furnish the funeral tables of the Romans. Egypt,\r\n    some say, first produced this herb; thence it was introduced, by\r\n    some unknown voyager, into Sardinia, where the Carthaginians\r\n    found it, and made it known to the inhabitants of Marseilles.\r\n    (See No. 123.)\r\n\r\nFRIED PARSLEY, for Garnishing.\r\n\r\n494. INGREDIENTS.--Parsley, hot lard or clarified dripping.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Gather some young parsley; wash, pick, and dry it thoroughly in\r\na cloth; put it into the wire basket of which we have given an\r\nengraving, and hold it in boiling lard or dripping for a minute or two.\r\nDirectly it is done, lift out the basket, and let it stand before the\r\nfire, that the parsley may become thoroughly crisp; and the quicker it\r\nis fried the better. Should the kitchen not be furnished with the above\r\narticle, throw the parsley into the frying-pan, and when crisp, lift it\r\nout with a slice, dry it before the fire, and when thoroughly crisp, it\r\nwill be ready for use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WIRE BASKET.]\r\n\r\n    WIRE BASKET.--For this recipe, a wire basket, as shown in the\r\n    annexed engraving, will be found very useful. It is very light\r\n    and handy, and may be used for other similar purposes besides\r\n    that described above.\r\n\r\nPARSLEY JUICE, for Colouring various Dishes.\r\n\r\n495. Procure some nice young parsley; wash it and dry it thoroughly in a\r\ncloth; pound the leaves in a mortar till all the juice is extracted, and\r\nput the juice in a teacup or small jar; place this in a saucepan of\r\nboiling water, and warm it on the _bain marie_ principle just long\r\nenough to take off its rawness; let it drain, and it will be ready for\r\ncolouring.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE PARSLEY THROUGH THE WINTER.\r\n\r\n496. Use freshly-gathered parsley for keeping, and wash it perfectly\r\nfree from grit and dirt; put it into boiling water which has been\r\nslightly salted and well skimmed, and then let it boil for 2 or 3\r\nminutes; take it out, let it drain, and lay it on a sieve in front of\r\nthe fire, when it should be dried as expeditiously as possible. Store it\r\naway in a very dry place in bottles, and when wanted for use, pour over\r\nit a little warm water, and let it stand for about 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This may be done at any time between June and October.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXCELLENT PICKLE.\r\n\r\n497. INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of medium-sized onions, cucumbers,\r\nand sauce-apples; 1-1/2 teaspoonful of salt, 3/4 teaspoonful of cayenne,\r\n1 wineglassful of soy, 1 wineglassful of sherry; vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice sufficient cucumbers, onions, and apples to fill a pint\r\nstone jar, taking care to cut the slices very thin; arrange them in\r\nalternate layers, shaking in as you proceed salt and cayenne in the\r\nabove proportion; pour in the soy and wine, and fill up with vinegar. It\r\nwill be fit for use the day it is made.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in August and September.\r\n\r\n[This recipe was forwarded to the editress of this work by a subscriber\r\nto the \"Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine.\" Mrs. Beeton, not having\r\ntested it, cannot vouch for its excellence; but the contributor spoke\r\nvery highly in its favour.]\r\n\r\n    SOY.--This is a sauce frequently made use of for fish, and comes\r\n    from Japan, where it is prepared from the seeds of a plant\r\n    called _Dolichos Soja_. The Chinese also manufacture it; but\r\n    that made by the Japanese is said to be the best. All sorts of\r\n    statements have been made respecting the very general\r\n    adulteration of this article in England, and we fear that many\r\n    of them are too true. When genuine, it is of an agreeable\r\n    flavour, thick, and of a clear brown colour.\r\n\r\nPICKLED RED CABBAGE.\r\n\r\n498. INGREDIENTS.--Red cabbages, salt and water; to each quart of\r\nvinegar, 1/2 oz. of ginger well bruised, 1 oz. of whole black pepper,\r\nand, when liked, a little cayenne.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take off the outside decayed leaves of a nice red cabbage, cut\r\nit in quarters, remove the stalks, and cut it across in very thin\r\nslices. Lay these on a dish, and strew them plentifully with salt,\r\ncovering them with another dish. Let them remain for 24 hours, turn into\r\na colander to drain, and, if necessary, wipe lightly with a clean soft\r\ncloth. Put them in a jar; boil up the vinegar with spices in the above\r\nproportion, and, when cold, pour it over the cabbage. It will be fit for\r\nuse in a week or two, and, if kept for a very long time, the cabbage is\r\nliable get soft and to discolour. To be really nice and crisp, and of a\r\ngood red colour, it should be eaten almost immediately after it is made.\r\nA little bruised cochineal boiled with the vinegar adds much to the\r\nappearance of this pickle. Tie down with bladder, and keep in a dry\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July and August, but the pickle will be much more crisp\r\nif the frost has just touched the leaves.\r\n\r\n    RED CABBAGE.--This plant, in its growth, is similar in form to\r\n    that of the white, but is of a bluish-purple colour, which,\r\n    however, turns red on the application of acid, as is the case\r\n    with all vegetable blues. It is principally from the white\r\n    vegetable that the Germans make their _sauer kraut_; a dish held\r\n    in such high estimation with the inhabitants of Vaderland, but\r\n    which requires, generally speaking, with strangers, a long\r\n    acquaintance in order to become sufficiently impressed with its\r\n    numerous merits. The large red Dutch is the kind generally\r\n    recommended for pickling.\r\n\r\nPLUM-PUDDING SAUCE.\r\n\r\n499. INGREDIENTS.--1 wineglassful of brandy, 2 oz. of very fresh butter,\r\n1 glass of Madeira, pounded sugar to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the pounded sugar in a basin, with part of the brandy and\r\nthe butter; let it stand by the side of the fire until it is warm and\r\nthe sugar and butter are dissolved; then add the rest of the brandy,\r\nwith the Madeira. Either pour it over the pudding, or serve in a tureen.\r\nThis is a very rich and excellent sauce.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 3d. for this quantity.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a pudding made for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUIN'S SAUCE, an excellent Fish Sauce.\r\n\r\n500. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of walnut pickle, 1/2 pint of port wine, 1\r\npint of mushroom ketchup, 1 dozen anchovies, 1 dozen shalots, 1/4 pint\r\nof soy, 1/2 teaspoonful of cayenne.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a saucepan, having previously\r\nchopped the shalots and anchovies very small; simmer for 15 minutes,\r\nstrain, and, when cold, bottle off for use: the corks should be well\r\nsealed to exclude the air.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAVIGOTTE, a French Salad Sauce.\r\n\r\n_Mons. Ude's Recipe_.\r\n\r\n501. INGREDIENTS.--1 teaspoonful of mushroom ketchup, 1 teaspoonful of\r\ncavice, 1 teaspoonful of Chili vinegar, 1 teaspoonful of Reading sauce,\r\na piece of butter the size of an egg, 3 tablespoonfuls of thick\r\nBéchamel, No. 367, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 3 tablespoonfuls\r\nof cream; salt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scald the parsley, mince the leaves very fine, and add it to\r\nall the other ingredients; after mixing the whole together thoroughly,\r\nthe sauce will be ready for use.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING SAUCE.\r\n\r\n502. INGREDIENTS.--2-1/2 pints of walnut pickle, 1-1/2 oz. of shalots, 1\r\nquart of spring water, 3/4 pint of Indian soy, 1/2 oz. of bruised\r\nginger, 1/2 oz. of long pepper, 1 oz. of mustard-seed, 1 anchovy, 1/2\r\noz. of cayenne, 1/4 oz. of dried sweet bay-leaves.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Bruise the shalots in a mortar, and put them in a stone jar\r\nwith the walnut-liquor; place it before the fire, and let it boil until\r\nreduced to 2 pints. Then, into another jar, put all the ingredients\r\nexcept the bay-leaves, taking care that they are well bruised, so that\r\nthe flavour may be thoroughly extracted; put this also before the fire,\r\nand let it boil for 1 hour, or rather more. When the contents of both\r\njars are sufficiently cooked, mix them together, stirring them well as\r\nyou mix them, and submit them to a slow boiling for 1/2 hour; cover\r\nclosely, and let them stand 24 hours in a cool place; then open the jar\r\nand add the bay-leaves; let it stand a week longer closed down, when\r\nstrain through a flannel bag, and it will be ready for use. The above\r\nquantities will make 1/2 gallon.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This sauce may be made at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOULADE, or FRENCH SALAD-DRESSING.\r\n\r\n503. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1/2 tablespoonful of made mustard, salt and\r\ncayenne to taste, 3 tablespoonfuls of olive-oil, 1 tablespoonful of\r\ntarragon or plain vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil 3 eggs quite hard for about 1/4 hour, put them into cold\r\nwater, and let them remain in it for a few minutes; strip off the\r\nshells, put the yolks in a mortar, and pound them very smoothly; add to\r\nthem, very gradually, the mustard, seasoning, and vinegar, keeping all\r\nwell stirred and rubbed down with the back of a wooden spoon. Put in the\r\noil drop by drop, and when this is thoroughly mixed with the other\r\ningredients, add the yolk of a raw egg, and stir well, when it will be\r\nready for use. This sauce should not be curdled; and to prevent this,\r\nthe only way is to mix a little of everything at a time, and not to\r\ncease stirring. The quantities of oil and vinegar may be increased or\r\ndiminished according to taste, as many persons would prefer a smaller\r\nproportion of the former ingredient.\r\n\r\nGREEN REMOULADE is made by using tarragon vinegar instead of plain, and\r\ncolouring with a little parsley-juice, No. 495. Harvey's sauce, or Chili\r\nvinegar, may be added at pleasure.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to boil the eggs.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a salad made for 4 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TARRAGON.]\r\n\r\n    TARRAGON.--The leaves of this plant, known to naturalists as\r\n    _Artemisia dracunculus_, are much used in France as a flavouring\r\n    ingredient for salads. From it also is made the vinegar known as\r\n    tarragon vinegar, which is employed by the French in mixing\r\n    their mustard. It originally comes from Tartary, and does not\r\n    seed in France.\r\n\r\nSAGE-AND-ONION STUFFING, for Geese, Ducks, and Pork.\r\n\r\n504. INGREDIENTS.--4 large onions, 10 sage-leaves, 1/4 lb. of bread\r\ncrumbs, 1-1/2 oz. of butter, salt and pepper to taste, 1 egg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the onions, put them into boiling water, let them simmer\r\nfor 5 minutes or rather longer, and, just before they are taken out, put\r\nin the sage-leaves for a minute or two to take off their rawness. Chop\r\nboth these very fine, add the bread, seasoning, and butter, and work the\r\nwhole together with the yolk of an egg, when the stuffing will be ready\r\nfor use. It should be rather highly seasoned, and the sage-leaves should\r\nbe very finely chopped. Many cooks do not parboil the onions in the\r\nmanner just stated, but merely use them raw. The stuffing then, however,\r\nis not nearly so mild, and, to many tastes, its strong flavour would be\r\nvery objectionable. When made for goose, a portion of the liver of the\r\nbird, simmered for a few minutes and very finely minced, is frequently\r\nadded to this stuffing; and where economy is studied, the egg may be\r\ndispensed with.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 5 minutes to simmer the onions.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 goose, or a pair of ducks.\r\n\r\n\r\n505. SOYER'S RECIPE FOR GOOSE STUFFING.--Take 4 apples, peeled and\r\ncored, 4 onions, 4 leaves of sage, and 4 leaves of lemon thyme not\r\nbroken, and boil them in a stewpan with sufficient water to cover them;\r\nwhen done, pulp them through a sieve, removing the sage and thyme; then\r\nadd sufficient pulp of mealy potatoes to cause it to be sufficiently dry\r\nwithout sticking to the hand; add pepper and salt, and stuff the bird.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALAD DRESSING (Excellent).\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n506. INGREDIENTS.--1 teaspoonful of mixed mustard, 1 teaspoonful of\r\npounded sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of salad oil, 4 tablespoonfuls of milk,\r\n2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, cayenne and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the mixed mustard into a salad-bowl with the sugar, and add\r\nthe oil drop by drop, carefully stirring and mixing all these\r\ningredients well together. Proceed in this manner with the milk and\r\nvinegar, which must be added very _gradually_, or the sauce will curdle.\r\nPut in the seasoning, when the mixture will be ready for use. If this\r\ndressing is properly made, it will have a soft creamy appearance, and\r\nwill be found very delicious with crab, or cold fried fish (the latter\r\ncut into dice), as well as with salads. In mixing salad dressings, the\r\ningredients cannot be added _too gradually_, or _stirred too much_.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a small salad.\r\n\r\nThis recipe can be confidently recommended by the editress, to whom it\r\nwas given by an intimate friend noted for her salads.\r\n\r\n    SCARCITY OF SALADS IN ENGLAND.--Three centuries ago, very few\r\n    vegetables were cultivated in England, and an author writing of\r\n    the period of Henry VIII.'s reign, tells us that neither salad,\r\n    nor carrots, nor cabbages, nor radishes, nor any other\r\n    comestibles of a like nature, were grown in any part of the\r\n    kingdom: they came from Holland and Flanders. We further learn,\r\n    that Queen Catharine herself, with all her royalty, could not\r\n    procure a salad of English growth for her dinner. The king was\r\n    obliged to mend this sad state of affairs, and send to Holland\r\n    for a gardener in order to cultivate those pot-herbs, in the\r\n    growth of which England is now, perhaps, not behind any other\r\n    country in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLIVE.]\r\n\r\n    THE OLIVE AND OLIVE OIL.--This tree assumes a high degree of\r\n    interest from the historical circumstances with which it is\r\n    connected. A leaf of it was brought into the ark by the dove,\r\n    when that vessel was still floating on the waters of the great\r\n    deep, and gave the first token that the deluge was subsiding.\r\n    Among the Greeks, the prize of the victor in the Olympic games\r\n    was a wreath of wild olive; and the \"Mount of Olives\" is\r\n    rendered familiar to our ears by its being mentioned in the\r\n    Scriptures as near to Jerusalem. The tree is indigenous in the\r\n    north of Africa, Syria, and Greece; and the Romans introduced it\r\n    to Italy. In Spain and the south of France it is now cultivated;\r\n    and although it grows in England, its fruit does not ripen in\r\n    the open air. Both in Greece and Portugal the fruit is eaten in\r\n    its ripe state; but its taste is not agreeable to many palates.\r\n    To the Italian shepherd, bread and olives, with a little wine,\r\n    form a nourishing diet; but in England, olives are usually only\r\n    introduced by way of dessert, to destroy the taste of the viands\r\n    which have been previously eaten, that the flavour of the wine\r\n    may be the better enjoyed. There are three kinds of olives\r\n    imported to London,--the French, Spanish, and Italian: the first\r\n    are from Provence, and are generally accounted excellent; the\r\n    second are larger, but more bitter; and the last are from Lucca,\r\n    and are esteemed the best. The oil extracted from olives, called\r\n    olive oil, or salad oil, is, with the continentals, in continual\r\n    request, more dishes being prepared with than without it, we\r\n    should imagine. With us, it is principally used in mixing a\r\n    salad, and when thus employed, it tends to prevent fermentation,\r\n    and is an antidote against flatulency.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n507. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1 teaspoonful of mixed mustard, 1/4\r\nteaspoonful of white pepper, half that quantity of cayenne, salt to\r\ntaste, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the eggs until hard, which will be in about 1/4 hour or 20\r\nminutes; put them into cold water, take off the shells, and pound the\r\nyolks in a mortar to a smooth paste. Then add all the other ingredients,\r\nexcept the vinegar, and stir them well until the whole are thoroughly\r\nincorporated one with the other. Pour in sufficient vinegar to make it\r\nof the consistency of cream, taking care to add but little at a time.\r\nThe mixture will then be ready for use.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a moderate-sized salad.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The whites of the eggs, cut into rings, will serve very well as\r\na garnishing to the salad.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n508. INGREDIENTS.--1 egg, 1 teaspoonful of salad oil, 1 teaspoonful of\r\nmixed mustard, 1/4 teaspoonful of salt, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded\r\nsugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 6 tablespoonfuls of cream.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Prepare and mix the ingredients by the preceding recipe, and be\r\nvery particular that the whole is well stirred.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--In making salads, the vegetables, &c., should never be added to\r\nthe sauce very long before they are wanted for table; the dressing,\r\nhowever, may always be prepared some hours before required. Where salads\r\nare much in request, it is a good plan to bottle off sufficient dressing\r\nfor a few days' consumption, as, thereby, much time and trouble are\r\nsaved. If kept in a cool place, it will remain good for 4 or 5 days.\r\n\r\n    POETIC RECIPE FOR SALAD.--The Rev. Sydney Smith, the witty canon\r\n    of St. Paul's, who thought that an enjoyment of the good things\r\n    of this earth was compatible with aspirations for things higher,\r\n    wrote the following excellent recipe for salad, which we should\r\n    advise our readers not to pass by without a trial, when the hot\r\n    weather invites to a dish of cold lamb. May they find the\r\n    flavour equal to the rhyme.--\r\n\r\n      \"Two large potatoes, pass'd through kitchen sieve,\r\n      Smoothness and softness to the salad give:\r\n      Of mordent mustard add a single spoon,\r\n      Distrust the condiment that bites too soon;\r\n      But deem it not, thou man of herbs, a fault.\r\n      To add a double quantity of salt:\r\n      Four times the spoon with oil of Lucca crown,\r\n      And twice with vinegar procured from 'town;\r\n      True flavour needs it, and your poet begs,\r\n      The pounded yellow of two well-boil'd eggs.\r\n      Let onion's atoms lurk within the bowl,\r\n      And, scarce suspected, animate the whole;\r\n      And, lastly, in the flavour'd compound toss\r\n      A magic spoonful of anchovy sauce.\r\n      Oh! great and glorious, and herbaceous treat,\r\n      'Twould tempt the dying anchorite to eat.\r\n      Back to the world he'd turn his weary soul,\r\n      And plunge his fingers in the salad-bowl.\"\r\n\r\nSAUCE ALLEMANDE, or GERMAN SAUCE.\r\n\r\n509. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of sauce tournée (No. 517), the yolks of 2\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the sauce into a stewpan, heat it, and stir to it the\r\nbeaten yolks of 2 eggs, which have been previously strained. Let it just\r\nsimmer, but not boil, or the eggs will curdle; and after they are added\r\nto the sauce, it must be stirred without ceasing. This sauce is a\r\ngeneral favourite, and is used for many made dishes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 minute to simmer.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUCE ARISTOCRATIQUE (a Store Sauce).\r\n\r\n510. INGREDIENTS.--Green walnuts. To every pint of juice, 1 lb. of\r\nanchovies, 1 drachm of cloves, 1 drachm of mace, 1 drachm of Jamaica\r\nginger bruised, 8 shalots. To every pint of the boiled liquor, 1/2 pint\r\nof vinegar, 1/4 pint of port wine, 2 tablespoonfuls of soy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pound the walnuts in a mortar, squeeze out the juice through a\r\nstrainer, and let it stand to settle. Pour off the clear juice, and to\r\nevery pint of it, add anchovies, spices, and cloves in the above\r\nproportion. Boil all these together till the anchovies are dissolved,\r\nthen strain the juice again, put in the shalots (8 to every pint), and\r\nboil again. To every pint of the boiled liquor add vinegar, wine, and\r\nsoy, in the above quantities, and bottle off for use. Cork well, and\r\nseal the corks.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this sauce from the beginning to the middle of July,\r\nwhen walnuts are in perfection for sauces and pickling.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3s. 6d. for a quart.\r\n\r\n    MANUFACTURE OF SAUCES.--In France, during the reign of Louis\r\n    XII., at the latter end of the 14th century, there was formed a\r\n    company of sauce-manufacturers, who obtained, in those days of\r\n    monopolies, the exclusive privilege of making sauces. The\r\n    statutes drawn up by this company inform us that the famous\r\n    sauce à la cameline, sold by them, was to be composed or \"good\r\n    cinnamon, good ginger, good cloves, good grains of paradise,\r\n    good bread, and good vinegar.\" The sauce Tence, was to be made\r\n    of \"good sound almonds, good ginger, good wine, and good\r\n    verjuice.\" May we respectfully express a hope--not that we\r\n    desire to doubt it in the least--that the English\r\n    sauce-manufacturers of the 19th century are equally considerate\r\n    and careful in choosing their ingredients for their various\r\n    well-known preparations.\r\n\r\nSAUCE A L'AURORE, for Trout, Soles, &c.\r\n\r\n511. INGREDIENTS.--The spawn of 1 lobster, 1 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint of\r\nBéchamel (No. 367), the juice of 1/2 lemon, a high seasoning of salt and\r\ncayenne.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take the spawn and pound it in a mortar with the butter, until\r\nquite smooth, and work it through a hair sieve. Put the Béchamel into a\r\nstewpan, add the pounded spawn, the lemon-juice, which must be strained,\r\nand a plentiful seasoning of cayenne and salt; let it just simmer, but\r\ndo not allow it to boil, or the beautiful red colour of the sauce will\r\nbe spoiled. A small spoonful of anchovy essence may be added at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 minute to simmer. _Average cost_, for this quantity, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a pair of large soles.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUCE A LA MATELOTE, for Fish.\r\n\r\n512. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of Espagnole (No. 411), 3 onions, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, 1/2 glass of port wine, a bunch of\r\nsweet herbs, 1/2 bay-leaf, salt and pepper to taste, 1 clove, 2 berries\r\nof allspice, a little liquor in which the fish has been boiled,\r\nlemon-juice, and anchovy sauce.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice and fry the onions of a nice brown colour, and put them\r\ninto a stewpan with the Espagnole, ketchup, wine, and a little liquor in\r\nwhich the fish has been boiled. Add the seasoning, herbs, and spices,\r\nand simmer gently for 10 minutes, stirring well the whole time; strain\r\nit through a fine hair sieve, put in the lemon-juice and anchovy sauce,\r\nand pour it over the fish. This sauce may be very much enriched by\r\nadding a few small quenelles, or forcemeat balls made of fish, and also\r\nglazed onions or mushrooms. These, however, should not be added to the\r\nmatelote till it is dished.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This sauce originally took its name as being similar to that\r\nwhich the French sailor (_matelot_) employed as a relish to the fish he\r\ncaught and ate. In some cases, cider and perry were substituted for the\r\nwine. The Norman _matelotes_ were very celebrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BAY.]\r\n\r\n    THE BAY.--We have already described (see No. 180) the difference\r\n    between the cherry-laurel (_Prunus Laurus cerasus_) and the\r\n    classic laurel (_Laurus nobilis_), the former only being used\r\n    for culinary purposes. The latter beautiful evergreen was\r\n    consecrated by the ancients to priests and heroes, and used in\r\n    their sacrifices. \"A crown of bay\" was the earnestly-desired\r\n    reward for great enterprises, and for the display of uncommon\r\n    genius in oratory or writing. It was more particularly sacred to\r\n    Apollo, because, according to the fable, the nymph Daphne was\r\n    changed into a laurel-tree. The ancients believed, too, that the\r\n    laurel had the power of communicating the gift of prophecy, as\r\n    well as poetic genius; and, when they wished to procure pleasant\r\n    dreams, would place a sprig under the pillow of their bed. It\r\n    was the symbol, too, of victory, and it was thought that the\r\n    laurel could never be struck by lightning. From this word comes\r\n    that of \"laureate;\" Alfred Tennyson being the present poet\r\n    laureate, crowned with laurel as the first of living bards.\r\n\r\nSAUCE PIQUANTE, for Cutlets, Roast Meat, &c.\r\n\r\n513. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of butter, 1 small carrot, 6 shalots, 1 small\r\nbunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, 1/2 a bay-leaf, 2 slices of\r\nlean ham, 2 cloves, 6 peppercorns, 1 blade of mace, 3 whole allspice, 4\r\ntablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1/2 pint of stock (No. 104 or 105), 1 small\r\nlump of sugar, 1/4 saltspoonful of cayenne, salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put into a stewpan the butter, with the carrot and shalots,\r\nboth of which must be cut into small slices; add the herbs, bay-leaf,\r\nspices, and ham (which must be minced rather finely), and let these\r\ningredients simmer over a slow fire, until the bottom of the stewpan is\r\ncovered with a brown glaze. Keep stirring with a wooden spoon, and put\r\nin the remaining ingredients. Simmer very gently for 1/4 hour, skim off\r\nevery particle of fat, strain the sauce through a sieve, and serve very\r\nhot. Care must be taken that this sauce be not made too acid, although\r\nit should possess a sharpness indicated by its name. Of course the above\r\nquantity of vinegar may be increased or diminished at pleasure,\r\naccording to taste.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a medium-sized dish of cutlets.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GOOD SAUCE FOR VARIOUS BOILED PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n514. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of butter, 1/4 lb. of pounded sugar, a\r\nwineglassful of brandy or rum.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat the butter to a cream, until no lumps remain; add the\r\npounded sugar, and brandy or rum; stir once or twice until the whole is\r\nthoroughly mixed, and serve. This sauce may either be poured round the\r\npudding or served in a tureen, according to the taste or fancy of the\r\ncook or mistress.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d. for this quantity.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a pudding.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUCE ROBERT, for Steaks, &c.\r\n\r\n515. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of butter, 3 onions, 1 teaspoonful of flour, 4\r\ntablespoonfuls of gravy, or stock No. 105, salt and pepper to taste, 1\r\nteaspoonful of made mustard, 1 teaspoonful of vinegar, the juice of 1/2\r\nlemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the butter into a stewpan, set it on the fire, and, when\r\nbrowning, throw in the onions, which must be cut into small slices. Fry\r\nthem brown, but do not burn them; add the flour, shake the onions in it,\r\nand give the whole another fry. Put in the gravy and seasoning, and boil\r\nit gently for 10 minutes; skim off the fat, add the mustard, vinegar,\r\nand lemon-juice; give it one boil, and pour round the steaks, or\r\nwhatever dish the sauce has been prepared for.\r\n\r\n_Time_.---Altogether 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, for this quantity, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for about 2 lbs. of steak.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This sauce will be found an excellent accompaniment to roast\r\ngoose, pork, mutton cutlets, and various other dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GOOD SAUCE FOR STEAKS.\r\n\r\n516. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of whole black pepper, 1/2 oz. of allspice, 1\r\noz. of salt, 1/2 oz. grated horseradish, 1/2 oz. of pickled shalots, 1\r\npint of mushroom ketchup or walnut pickle.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pound all the ingredients finely in a mortar, and put them into\r\nthe ketchup or walnut-liquor. Let them stand for a fortnight, when\r\nstrain off the liquor and bottle for use. Either pour a little of the\r\nsauce over the steaks or mix it in the gravy.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This can be made at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--In using a jar of pickled walnuts, there is frequently left a\r\nlarge quantity of liquor; this should be converted into a sauce like the\r\nabove, and will be found a very useful relish.\r\n\r\n    THE GROWTH OF THE PEPPER-PLANT.--Our readers will see at Nos.\r\n    369 and 399, a description, with engravings, of the qualities of\r\n    black and long pepper, and an account of where these spices are\r\n    found. We will here say something of the manner of the growth of\r\n    the pepper-plant. Like the vine, it requires support, and it is\r\n    usual to plant a thorny tree by its side, to which it may cling.\r\n    In Malabar, the chief pepper district of India, the jacca-tree\r\n    (_Artocarpus integrifolia_) is made thus to yield its\r\n    assistance, the same soil being adapted to the growth of both\r\n    plants. The stem of the pepper-plant entwines round its support\r\n    to a considerable height; the flexile branches then droop\r\n    downwards, bearing at their extremities, as well as at other\r\n    parts, spikes of green flowers, which are followed by the\r\n    pungent berries. These hang in large bunches, resembling in\r\n    shape those of grapes; but the fruit grows distinct, each on a\r\n    little stalk, like currants. Each berry contains a single seed,\r\n    of a globular form and brownish colour, but which changes to a\r\n    nearly black when dried; and this is the pepper of commerce. The\r\n    leaves are not unlike those of the ivy, but are larger and of\r\n    rather lighter colour; they partake strongly of the peculiar\r\n    smell and pungent taste of the berry.\r\n\r\nSAUCE TOURNEE.\r\n\r\n517. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of white stock (No. 107), thickening of flour\r\nand butter, or white roux (No. 526), a faggot of savoury herbs,\r\nincluding parsley, 6 chopped mushrooms, 6 green onions.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the stock into a stewpan with the herbs, onions, and\r\nmushrooms, and let it simmer very gently for about 1/2 hour; stir in\r\nsufficient thickening to make it of a proper consistency; let it boil\r\nfor a few minutes, then skim off all the fat, strain and serve. This\r\nsauce, with the addition of a little cream, is now frequently called\r\nvelouté.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, for this quantity, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--If poultry trimmings are at hand, the stock should be made of\r\nthese; and the above sauce should not be made too thick, as it does not\r\nthen admit of the fat being nicely removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET SAUCE, for Venison.\r\n\r\n518. INGREDIENTS.--A small jar of red-currant jelly, 1 glass of port\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the above ingredients into a stewpan, set them over the\r\nfire, and, when melted, pour in a tureen and serve. It should not be\r\nallowed to boil.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes to melt the jelly.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 1s.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUCE FOR WILDFOWL.\r\n\r\n519. INGREDIENTS.--1 glass of port wine, 1 tablespoonful of Leamington\r\nsauce (No. 459), 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nlemon-juice, 1 slice of lemon-peel, 1 large shalot cut in slices, 1\r\nblade of mace, cayenne to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a stewpan, set it over the fire,\r\nand let it simmer for about 5 minutes; then strain and serve the sauce\r\nin a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes. _Average cost_, for this quantity, 8d.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-MEAT STUFFING, for Turkey.\r\n\r\n520. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of lean pork, 6 oz. of fat pork, both weighed\r\nafter being chopped (beef suet may be substituted for the latter), 2 oz.\r\nof bread crumbs, 1 small tablespoonful of minced sage, 1 blade of\r\npounded mace, salt and pepper to taste, 1 egg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the meat and fat very finely, mix with them the other\r\ningredients, taking care that the whole is thoroughly incorporated.\r\nMoisten with the egg, and the stuffing will be ready for use. Equal\r\nquantities of this stuffing and forcemeat, No. 417, will be found to\r\nanswer very well, as the herbs, lemon-peel, &c. in the latter, impart a\r\nvery delicious flavour to the sausage-meat. As preparations, however,\r\nlike stuffings and forcemeats, are matters to be decided by individual\r\ntastes, they must be left, to a great extent, to the discrimination of\r\nthe cook, who should study her employer's taste in this, as in every\r\nother respect.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a small turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVOURY JELLY FOR MEAT PIES.\r\n\r\n521. INGREDIENTS.--3 lbs. of shin of beef, 1 calf's-foot, 3 lbs. of\r\nknuckle of veal, poultry trimmings (if for game pies, any game\r\ntrimmings), 2 onions stuck with cloves, 2 carrots, 4 shalots, a bunch of\r\nsavoury herbs, 2 bay-leaves; when liked, 2 blades of mace and a little\r\nspice; 2 slices of lean ham, rather more than 2 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the meat and put it into a stewpan with all the\r\ningredients except the water; set it over a slow fire to draw down, and,\r\nwhen the gravy ceases to flow from the meat, pour in the water. Let it\r\nboil up, then carefully take away all scum from the top. Cover the\r\nstewpan closely, and let the stock simmer very gently for 4 hours: if\r\nrapidly boiled, the jelly will not be clear. When done, strain it\r\nthrough a fine sieve or flannel bag; and when cold, the jelly should be\r\nquite transparent. If this is not the case, clarify it with the whites\r\nof eggs, as described in recipe No. 109.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 hours. _Average cost_, for this quantity, 5s.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHRIMP SAUCE, for Various Kinds of Fish.\r\n\r\n522. INGREDIENTS.--1/3 pint of melted butter (No. 376), 1/4 pint of\r\npicked shrimps, cayenne to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the melted butter very smoothly by recipe No. 376, shell\r\nthe shrimps (sufficient to make 1/4 pint when picked), and put them into\r\nthe butter; season with cayenne, and let the sauce just simmer, but do\r\nnot allow it to boil. When liked, a teaspoonful of anchovy sauce may be\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 minute to simmer. _Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINACH GREEN FOR COLOURING VARIOUS DISHES.\r\n\r\n523. INGREDIENTS.--2 handfuls of spinach.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick and wash the spinach free from dirt, and pound the leaves\r\nin a mortar to extract the juice; then press it through a hair sieve,\r\nand put the juice into a small stewpan or jar. Place this in a bain\r\nmarie, or saucepan of boiling water, and let it set. Watch it closely,\r\nas it should not boil; and, as soon as it is done, lay it in a sieve, so\r\nthat all the water may drain from it, and the green will then be ready\r\nfor colouring. If made according to this recipe, the spinach-green will\r\nbe found far superior to that boiled in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOT SPICE, a Delicious Adjunct to Chops, Steaks, Gravies, &c.\r\n\r\n524. INGREDIENTS.--3 drachms each of ginger, black pepper, and cinnamon,\r\n7 cloves, 1/2 oz. mace, 1/4 oz. of cayenne, 1 oz. grated nutmeg, 1-1/2\r\noz. white pepper.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pound the ingredients, and mix them thoroughly together, taking\r\ncare that everything is well blended. Put the spice in a very dry glass\r\nbottle for use. The quantity of cayenne may be increased, should the\r\nabove not be enough to suit the palate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CINNAMON.]\r\n\r\n    CINNAMON.--The cinnamon-tree (_Laurus Cinnamomum_) is a valuable\r\n    and beautiful species of the laurel family, and grows to the\r\n    height of 20 or 30 feet. The trunk is short and straight, with\r\n    wide-spreading branches, and it has a smooth ash-like bark. The\r\n    leaves are upon short stalks, and are of an oval shape, and 3 to\r\n    5 inches long. The flowers are in panicles, with six small\r\n    petals, and the fruit is about the size of an olive, soft,\r\n    insipid, and of a deep blue. This incloses a nut, the kernel of\r\n    which germinates soon after it falls. The wood of the tree is\r\n    white and not very solid, and its root is thick and branching,\r\n    exuding a great quantity of camphor. The inner bark of the tree\r\n    forms the cinnamon of commerce. Ceylon was thought to be its\r\n    native island; but it has been found in Malabar, Cochin-China,\r\n    Sumatra, and the Eastern Islands; also in the Brazils, the\r\n    Mauritius, Jamaica, and other tropical localities.\r\n\r\nBROWN ROUX, a French Thickening for Gravies and Sauces.\r\n\r\n525. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of butter, 9 oz. of flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Melt the butter in a stewpan over a slow fire, and dredge in,\r\nvery gradually, the flour; stir it till of a light-brown colour--to\r\nobtain this do it very slowly, otherwise the flour will burn and impart\r\na bitter taste to the sauce it is mixed with. Pour it in a jar, and keep\r\nit for use: it will remain good some time.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 7d.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE ROUX, for thickening White Sauces.\r\n\r\n526. Allow the same proportions of butter and flour as in the preceding\r\nrecipe, and proceed in the same manner as for brown roux, but do not\r\nkeep it on the fire too long, and take care not to let it colour. This\r\nis used for thickening white sauce. Pour it into a jar to use when\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour. _Average cost_, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--A dessertspoonful will thicken a pint of gravy.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Besides the above, sauces may be thickened with potato flour,\r\nground rice, baked flour, arrowroot, &c.: the latter will be found far\r\npreferable to the ordinary flour for white sauces. A slice of bread,\r\ntoasted and added to gravies, answers the two purposes of thickening and\r\ncolouring them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH ONIONS--PICKLED.\r\n\r\n527. INGREDIENTS.--Onions, vinegar; salt and cayenne to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the onions in thin slices; put a layer of them in the\r\nbottom of a jar; sprinkle with salt and cayenne; then add another layer\r\nof onions, and season as before. Proceeding in this manner till the jar\r\nis full, pour in sufficient vinegar to cover the whole, and the pickle\r\nwill be fit for use in a month.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--May be had in England from September to February.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORE SAUCE, or CHEROKEE.\r\n\r\n528. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 oz. of cayenne pepper, 5 cloves of garlic, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of soy, 1 tablespoonful of walnut ketchup, 1 pint of\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil all the ingredients _gently_ for about 1/2 hour; strain\r\nthe liquor, and bottle off for use.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This sauce can be made at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO SAUCE--HOT, to serve with Cutlets, Roast Meats, &c.\r\n\r\n529. INGREDIENTS.--6 tomatoes, 2 shalots, 1 clove, 1 blade of mace, salt\r\nand cayenne to taste, 1/4 pint of gravy, No. 436, or stock No. 104.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the tomatoes in two, and squeeze the juice and seeds out;\r\nput them in a stewpan with all the ingredients, and let them simmer\r\n_gently_ until the tomatoes are tender enough to pulp; rub the whole\r\nthrough a sieve, boil it for a few minutes, and serve. The shalots and\r\nspices may be omitted when their flavour is objected to.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour, or rather more, to simmer the tomatoes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 1s.\r\n\r\n_In full season_ in September and October.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOMATO.]\r\n\r\n    TOMATO, OR LOVE-APPLE.--The plant which bears this fruit is a\r\n    native of South America, and takes its name from a Portuguese\r\n    word. The tomato fruit is about the size of a small potato, and\r\n    is chiefly used in soups, sauces, and gravies. It is sometimes\r\n    served to table roasted or boiled, and when green, makes a good\r\n    ketchup or pickle. In its unripe state, it is esteemed as\r\n    excellent sauce for roast goose or pork, and when quite ripe, a\r\n    good store sauce may be prepared from it.\r\n\r\nTOMATO SAUCE FOR KEEPING (Excellent).\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n530. INGREDIENTS.--To every quart of tomato-pulp allow 1 pint of cayenne\r\nvinegar (No. 386), 3/4 oz. of shalots, 3/4 oz. of garlic, peeled and cut\r\nin slices; salt to taste. To every six quarts of liquor, 1 pint of soy,\r\n1 pint of anchovy sauce.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Gather the tomatoes quite ripe; bake them in a slow oven till\r\ntender; rub them through a sieve, and to every quart of pulp add cayenne\r\nvinegar, shalots, garlic, and salt, in the above proportion; boil the\r\nwhole together till the garlic and shalots are quite soft; then rub it\r\nthrough a sieve, put it again into a saucepan, and, to every six quarts\r\nof the liquor, add 1 pint of soy and the same quantity of anchovy sauce,\r\nand boil altogether for about 20 minutes; bottle off for use, and\r\ncarefully seal or rosin the corks. This will keep good for 2 or 3 years,\r\nbut will be fit for use in a week. A useful and less expensive sauce may\r\nbe made by omitting the anchovy and soy.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this from the middle of September to the end of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n531. INGREDIENTS.--1 dozen tomatoes, 2 teaspoonfuls of the best powdered\r\nginger, 1 dessertspoonful of salt, 1 head of garlic chopped fine, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1 dessertspoonful of Chili vinegar (a small\r\nquantity of cayenne may be substituted for this).\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose ripe tomatoes, put them into a stone jar, and stand them\r\nin a cool oven until quite tender; when cold, take the skins and stalks\r\nfrom them, mix the pulp with the liquor which is in the jar, but do not\r\nstrain it; add all the other ingredients, mix well together, and put it\r\ninto well-sealed bottles. Stored away in a cool dry place, it will keep\r\ngood for years. It is ready for use as soon as made, but the flavour is\r\nbetter after a week or two. Should it not appear to keep, turn it out,\r\nand boil it up with a little additional ginger and cayenne. For\r\nimmediate use, the skins should be put into a wide-mouthed bottle with a\r\nlittle of the different ingredients, and they will be found very nice\r\nfor hashes or stews.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 or 5 hours in a cool oven.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the middle of September to the end of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n532. INGREDIENTS.--3 dozen tomatoes; to every pound of tomato-pulp allow\r\n1 pint of Chili vinegar, 1 oz. of garlic, 1 oz. of shalot, 2 oz. of\r\nsalt, 1 large green capsicum, 1/2 teaspoonful of cayenne, 2 pickled\r\ngherkins, 6 pickled onions, 1 pint of common vinegar, and the juice of 6\r\nlemons.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose the tomatoes when quite ripe and red; put them in a jar\r\nwith a cover to it, and bake them till tender. The better way is to put\r\nthem in the oven overnight, when it will not be too hot, and examine\r\nthem in the morning to see if they are tender. Do not allow them to\r\nremain in the oven long enough to break them; but they should be\r\nsufficiently soft to skin nicely and rub through the sieve. Measure the\r\npulp, and to each pound of pulp, add the above proportion of vinegar and\r\nother ingredients, taking care to chop very fine the garlic, shalot,\r\ncapsicum, onion, and gherkins. Boil the whole together till everything\r\nis tender; then again rub it through a sieve, and add the lemon-juice.\r\nNow boil the whole again till it becomes as thick as cream, and keep\r\ncontinually stirring; bottle it when quite cold, cork well, and seal the\r\ncorks. If the flavour of garlic and shalot is very much disliked,\r\ndiminish the quantities.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Bake the tomatoes in a cool oven all night.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the middle of September to the end of October.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A quantity of liquor will flow from the tomatoes, which must be\r\nput through the sieve with the rest. Keep it well stirred while on the\r\nfire, and use a wooden spoon.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIVERSAL PICKLE.\r\n\r\n533. INGREDIENTS.--To 6 quarts of vinegar allow 1 lb. of salt, 1/4 lb.\r\nof ginger, 1 oz. of mace, 1/2 lb. of shalots, 1 tablespoonful of\r\ncayenne, 2 oz. of mustard-seed, 1-1/2 oz. of turmeric.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil all the ingredients together for about 20 minutes; when\r\ncold, put them into a jar with whatever vegetables you choose, such as\r\nradish-pods, French beans, cauliflowers, gherkins, &c. &c., as these\r\ncome into season; put them in fresh as you gather them, having\r\npreviously wiped them perfectly free from moisture and grit. This pickle\r\nwill be fit for use in about 8 or 9 months.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make the pickle in May or June, to be ready for the\r\nvarious vegetables.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--As this pickle takes 2 or 3 months to make,--that is to say,\r\nnearly that time will elapse before all the different vegetables are\r\nadded,--care must be taken to keep the jar which contains the pickle\r\nwell covered, either with a closely-fitting lid, or a piece of bladder\r\nsecurely tied over, so as perfectly to exclude the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLED WALNUTS (Very Good).\r\n\r\n534. INGREDIENTS.--100 walnuts, salt and water. To each quart of vinegar\r\nallow 2 oz. of whole black pepper, 1 oz. of allspice, 1 oz. of bruised\r\nginger.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure the walnuts while young; be careful they are not woody,\r\nand prick them well with a fork; prepare a strong brine of salt and\r\nwater (4 lbs. of salt to each gallon of water), into which put the\r\nwalnuts, letting them remain 9 days, and changing the brine every third\r\nday; drain them off, put them on a dish, place it in the sun until they\r\nbecome perfectly black, which will be in 2 or 3 days; have ready dry\r\njars, into which place the walnuts, and do not quite fill the jars. Boil\r\nsufficient vinegar to cover them, for 10 minutes, with spices in the\r\nabove proportion, and pour it hot over the walnuts, which must be quite\r\ncovered with the pickle; tie down with bladder, and keep in a dry place.\r\nThey will be fit for use in a month, and will keep good 2 or 3 years.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this from the beginning to the middle of July,\r\nbefore the walnuts harden.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--When liked, a few shalots may be added to the vinegar, and\r\nboiled with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALNUT KETCHUP.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n535. INGREDIENTS.--100 walnuts, 1 handful of salt, 1 quart of vinegar,\r\n1/4 oz. of mace, 1/4 oz. of nutmeg, 1/4 oz. of cloves, 1/4 oz. of\r\nginger, 1/4 oz. of whole black pepper, a small piece of horseradish, 20\r\nshalots, 1/4 lb. of anchovies, 1 pint of port wine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure the walnuts at the time you can run a pin through them,\r\nslightly bruise, and put them into a jar with the salt and vinegar, let\r\nthem stand 8 days, stirring every day; then drain the liquor from them,\r\nand boil it, with the above ingredients, for about 1/2 hour. It may be\r\nstrained or not, as preferred, and, if required, a little more vinegar\r\nor wine can be added, according to taste. When bottled well, seal the\r\ncorks.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this from the beginning to the middle of July, when\r\nwalnuts are in perfection for pickling purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n536. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 sieve of walnut-shells, 2 quarts of water, salt,\r\n1/2 lb. of shalots, 1 oz. of cloves, 1 oz. of mace, 1 oz. of whole\r\npepper, 1 oz. of garlic.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the walnut-shells into a pan, with the water, and a large\r\nquantity of salt; let them stand for 10 days, then break the shells up\r\nin the water, and let it drain through a sieve, putting a heavy weight\r\non the top to express the juice; place it on the fire, and remove all\r\nscum that may arise. Now boil the liquor with the shalots, cloves, mace,\r\npepper, and garlic, and let all simmer till the shalots sink; then put\r\nthe liquor into a pan, and, when cold, bottle, and cork closely. It\r\nshould stand 6 months before using: should it ferment during that time,\r\nit must be again boiled and skimmed.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in September, when the walnut-shells are obtainable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WALNUT.]\r\n\r\n    THE WALNUT.--This nut is a native of Persia, and was introduced\r\n    into England from France. As a pickle, it is much used in the\r\n    green state; and grated walnuts in Spain are much employed, both\r\n    in tarts and other dishes. On the continent it is occasionally\r\n    employed as a substitute for olive oil in cooking; but it is\r\n    apt, under such circumstances, to become rancid. The matter\r\n    which remains after the oil is extracted is considered highly\r\n    nutritious for poultry. It is called _mare_, and in Switzerland\r\n    is eaten under the name of _pain amer_ by the poor. The oil is\r\n    frequently manufactured into a kind of soap, and the leaves and\r\n    green husks yield an extract, which, as a brown dye, is used to\r\n    stain hair, wool, and wood.\r\n\r\nWHITE SAUCE (Good).\r\n\r\n537. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of white stock (No. 107), 1/2 pint of cream,\r\n1 dessertspoonful of flour, salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have ready a delicately-clean saucepan, into which put the\r\nstock, which should be well flavoured with vegetables, and rather\r\nsavoury; mix the flour smoothly with the cream, add it to the stock,\r\nseason with a little salt, and boil all these ingredients very gently\r\nfor about 10 minutes, keeping them well stirred the whole time, as this\r\nsauce is very liable to burn.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a pair of fowls.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE SAUCE, made without Meat.\r\n\r\n538. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of butter, 2 small onions, 1 carrot, 1/2 a\r\nsmall teacupful of flour, 1 pint of new milk, salt and cayenne to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the onions and carrot very small, and put them into a\r\nstewpan with the butter; simmer them till the butter is nearly dried up;\r\nthen stir in the flour, and add the milk; boil the whole gently until it\r\nthickens, strain it, season with salt and cayenne, and it will be ready\r\nto serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour. _Average cost_, 5d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a pair of fowls.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE SAUCE (a very Simple and Inexpensive Method).\r\n\r\n539. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of milk, 1-1/2 oz. of rice, 1 strip of\r\nlemon-peel, 1 small blade of pounded mace, salt and cayenne to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the milk with the lemon-peel and rice until the latter is\r\nperfectly tender, then take out the lemon-peel and pound the milk and\r\nrice together; put it back into the stewpan to warm, add the mace and\r\nseasoning, give it one boil, and serve. This sauce should be of the\r\nconsistency of thick cream.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1-1/2 hour to boil the rice.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a pair of fowls.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LEAMINGTON STOVE, OR KITCHENER.]\r\n\r\nVARIOUS MODES OF COOKING MEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS.\r\n\r\n540. In Our \"INTRODUCTION TO COOKERY\" (_see_ No. 76) we have described\r\nthe gradual progress of mankind in the art of cookery, the probability\r\nbeing, that the human race, for a long period, lived wholly on fruits.\r\nMan's means of attacking animals, even if he had the desire of\r\nslaughtering them, were very limited, until he acquired the use of arms.\r\nHe, however, made weapons for himself, and, impelled by a carnivorous\r\ninstinct, made prey of the animals that surrounded him. It is natural\r\nthat man should seek to feed on flesh; he has too small a stomach to be\r\nsupported alone by fruit, which has not sufficient nourishment to\r\nrenovate him. It is possible he might subsist on vegetables; but their\r\npreparation needs the knowledge of art, only to be obtained after the\r\nlapse of many centuries. Man's first weapons were the branches of trees,\r\nwhich were succeeded by bows and arrows, and it is worthy of remark,\r\nthat these latter weapons have been found with the natives of all\r\nclimates and latitudes. It is singular how this idea presented itself to\r\nindividuals so differently placed.\r\n\r\n541. BRILLAT SAVARIN says, that raw flesh has but one\r\ninconvenience,--from its viscousness it attaches itself to the teeth. He\r\ngoes on to say, that it is not, however, disagreeable; but, when\r\nseasoned with salt, that it is easily digested. He tells a story of a\r\nCroat captain, whom he invited to dinner in 1815, during the occupation\r\nof Paris by the allied troops. This officer was amazed at his host's\r\npreparations, and said, \"When we are campaigning, and get hungry, we\r\nknock over the first animal we find, cut off a steak, powder it with\r\nsalt, which we always have in the sabretasche, put it under the saddle,\r\ngallop over it for half a mile, and then dine like princes.\" Again, of\r\nthe huntsmen of Dauphiny it is said, that when they are out shooting in\r\nSeptember, they take with them both pepper and salt. If they kill a very\r\nfat bird, they pluck and season it, and, after carrying it some time in\r\ntheir caps, eat it. This, they declare, is the best way of serving it\r\nup.\r\n\r\n542. SUBSEQUENTLY TO THE CROAT MODE, which, doubtless, was in fashion in\r\nthe earlier ages of the world, fire was discovered. This was an\r\naccident; for fire is not, although we are accustomed to call it so, an\r\nelement, or spontaneous. Many savage nations have been found utterly\r\nignorant of it, and many races had no other way of dressing their food\r\nthan by exposing it to the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n543. THE INHABITANTS OF THE MARIAN ISLANDS, which were discovered in\r\n1521, had no idea of fire. Never was astonishment greater than theirs\r\nwhen they first saw it, on the descent of Magellan, the navigator, on\r\none of their isles. At first they thought it a kind of animal, that\r\nfixed itself to and fed upon wood. Some of them, who approached too\r\nnear, being burnt, the rest were terrified, and durst only look upon it\r\nat a distance. They were afraid, they said, of being bit, or lest that\r\ndreadful animal should wound with his violent respiration and dreadful\r\nbreath; for these were the first notions they formed of the heat and\r\nflame. Such, too, probably, were the notions the Greeks originally\r\nformed of them.\r\n\r\n544. FIRE HAVING BEEN DISCOVERED, mankind endeavoured to make use of it\r\nfor drying, and afterwards for cooking their meat; but they were a\r\nconsiderable time before they hit upon proper and commodious methods of\r\nemploying it in the preparation of their food.\r\n\r\n545. MEAT, THEN, PLACED ON BURNING FUEL was found better than when raw:\r\nit had more firmness, was eaten with less difficulty, and the ozmazome\r\nbeing condensed by the carbonization, gave it a pleasing perfume and\r\nflavour. Still, however, the meat cooked on the coal would become\r\nsomewhat befouled, certain portions of the fuel adhering to it. This\r\ndisadvantage was remedied by passing spits through it, and placing it at\r\na suitable height above the burning fuel. Thus grilling was invented;\r\nand it is well known that, simple as is this mode of cookery, yet all\r\nmeat cooked in this way is richly and pleasantly flavoured. In Homer's\r\ntime, the, art of cookery had not advanced much beyond this; for we read\r\nin the \"Iliad,\" how the great Achilles and his friend Patroclus regaled\r\nthe three Grecian leaders on bread, wine, and broiled meat. It is\r\nnoticeable, too, that Homer does not speak of boiled meat anywhere in\r\nhis poems. Later, however, the Jews, coming out of their captivity in\r\nEgypt, had made much greater progress. They undoubtedly possessed\r\nkettles; and in one of these, Esau's mess of pottage, for which he sold\r\nhis birthright, must have been prepared.\r\n\r\n546. HAVING THUS BRIEFLY TRACED A HISTORY OF GASTRONOMICAL PROGRESSES,\r\nwe will now proceed to describe the various methods of cooking meat, and\r\nmake a few observations on the chemical changes which occur in each of\r\nthe operations.\r\n\r\n547. IN THIS COUNTRY, plain boiling, roasting, and baking are the usual\r\nmethods of cooking animal food. To explain the philosophy of these\r\nsimple culinary operations, we must advert to the effects that are\r\nproduced by heat on the principal constituents of flesh. When\r\nfinely-chopped mutton or beef is steeped for some time in a small\r\nquantity of clean water, and then subjected to slight pressure, the\r\njuice of the meat is extracted, and there is left a white tasteless\r\nresidue, consisting chiefly of muscular fibres. When this residue is\r\nheated to between 158° and 177° Fahrenheit, the fibres shrink together,\r\nand become hard and horny. The influence of an elevated temperature on\r\nthe soluble extract of flesh is not less remarkable. When the watery\r\ninfusion, which contains all the savoury constituents of the meat, is\r\ngradually heated, it soon becomes turbid; and, when the temperature\r\nreaches 133°, flakes of whitish matter separate. These flakes are\r\n_albumen_, a substance precisely similar, in all its properties, to the\r\nwhite of egg (see No. 101). When the temperature of the watery extract\r\nis raised to 158°, the colouring matter of the blood coagulates, and the\r\nliquid, which was originally tinged red by this substance, is left\r\nperfectly clear, and almost colourless. When evaporated, even at a\r\ngentle heat, this residual liquid gradually becomes brown, and acquires\r\nthe flavour of roast meat.\r\n\r\n548. THESE INTERESTING FACTS, discovered in the laboratory, throw a\r\nflood of light upon the mysteries of the kitchen. The fibres of meat are\r\nsurrounded by a liquid which contains albumen in its soluble state, just\r\nas it exists in the unboiled egg. During the operation of boiling or\r\nroasting, this substance coagulates, and thereby prevents the\r\ncontraction and hardening of the fibres. The tenderness of well-cooked\r\nmeat is consequently proportioned to the amount of albumen deposited in\r\nits substance. Meat is underdone when it has been heated throughout only\r\nto the temperature of coagulating albumen: it is thoroughly done when it\r\nhas been heated through its whole mass to the temperature at which the\r\ncolouring matter of the blood coagulates: it is overdone when the heat\r\nhas been continued long enough to harden the fibres.\r\n\r\n549. THE JUICE OF FLESH IS WATER, holding in solution many substances\r\nbesides albumen, which are of the highest possible value as articles of\r\nfood. In preparing meat for the table, great care should be taken to\r\nprevent the escape of this precious juice, as the succulence and\r\nsapidity of the meat depend on its retention. The meat to be cooked\r\nshould be exposed at first to a quick heat, which immediately coagulates\r\nthe albumen on and near the surface. A kind of shell is thus formed,\r\nwhich effectually retains the whole of the juice within the meat.\r\n\r\n550. DURING THE OPERATIONS OF BOILING, BOASTING, AND BAKING, fresh beef\r\nand mutton, when moderately fat, lose, according to Johnston, on an\r\naverage about--\r\n\r\n                      In boiling.  In baking.    In roasting.\r\n\r\n  4 lbs. of beef lose    1 lb.     1 lb. 3 oz.   1 lb. 5 oz.\r\n\r\n  4 lbs. of mutton lose  14 oz.    1 lb. 4 oz.   1 lb. 6 oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAKING DISH.]\r\n\r\n551. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ROASTING MEAT AND BAKING IT, may be\r\ngenerally described as consisting in the fact, that, in baking it, the\r\nfumes caused by the operation are not carried off in the same way as\r\noccurs in roasting. Much, however, of this disadvantage is obviated by\r\nthe improved construction of modern ovens, and of especially those in\r\nconnection with the Leamington kitchener, of which we give an engraving\r\nhere, and a full description of which will be seen at paragraph No. 65,\r\nwith the prices at which they can be purchased of Messrs. R. and J.\r\nSlack, of the Strand. With meat baked in the generality of ovens,\r\nhowever, which do not possess ventilators on the principle of this\r\nkitchener, there is undoubtedly a peculiar taste, which does not at all\r\nequal the flavour developed by roasting meat. The chemistry of baking\r\nmay be said to be the same as that described in roasting.\r\n\r\n552. SHOULD THE OVEN BE VERY BRISK, it will be found necessary to cover\r\nthe joint with a piece of white paper, to prevent the meat from being\r\nscorched and blackened outside, before the heat can penetrate into the\r\ninside. This paper should be removed half an hour before the time of\r\nserving dinner, so that the joint may take a good colour.\r\n\r\n553. BY MEANS OF A JAR, many dishes, which will be enumerated under\r\ntheir special heads, may be economically prepared in the oven. The\r\nprincipal of these are soup, gravies, jugged hare, beef tea; and this\r\nmode of cooking may be advantageously adopted with a ham, which has\r\npreviously been covered with a common crust of flour and water.\r\n\r\n554. ALL DISHES PREPARED FOR BAKING should be more highly seasoned than\r\nwhen intended to be roasted. There are some dishes which, it may be\r\nsaid, are at least equally well cooked in the oven as by the roaster;\r\nthus, a shoulder of mutton and baked potatoes, a fillet or breast of\r\nveal, a sucking pig, a hare, well basted, will be received by\r\nconnoisseurs as well, when baked, as if they had been roasted. Indeed,\r\nthe baker's oven, or the family oven, may often, as has been said, be\r\nsubstituted for the cook and the spit with greater economy and\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\n555. A BAKING-DISH, of which we give an engraving, should not be less\r\nthan 6 or 7 inches deep; so that the meat, which of course cannot be\r\nbasted, can stew in its own juices. In the recipe for each dish, full\r\nexplanations concerning any special points in relation to it will be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILING.\r\n\r\n556. BOILING, or the preparation of meat by hot water, though one of the\r\neasiest processes in cookery, requires skilful management. Boiled meat\r\nshould be tender, savoury, and full of its own juice, or natural gravy;\r\nbut, through the carelessness and ignorance of cooks, it is too often\r\nsent to table hard, tasteless, and innutritious. To insure a successful\r\nresult in boiling flesh, the heat of the fire must be judiciously\r\nregulated, the proper quantity of water must be kept up in the pot, and\r\nthe scum which rises to the surface must be carefully removed.\r\n\r\n557. MANY WRITERS ON COOKERY assert that the meat to be boiled should be\r\nput into cold water, and that the pot should be heated gradually; but\r\nLiebig, the highest authority on all matters connected with the\r\nchemistry of food, has shown that meat so treated loses some of its most\r\nnutritious constituents. \"If the flesh,\" says the great chemist, \"be\r\nintroduced into the boiler when the water is in a state of brisk\r\nebullition, and if the boiling be kept up for a few minutes, and the pot\r\nthen placed in a warm place, so that the temperature of the water is\r\nkept at 158° to 165°, we have the united conditions for giving to the\r\nflesh the qualities which best fit it for being eaten.\" When a piece of\r\nmeat is plunged into boiling water, the albumen which is near the\r\nsurface immediately coagulates, forming an envelope, which prevents the\r\nescape of the internal juice, and most effectually excludes the water,\r\nwhich, by mixing with this juice, would render the meat insipid. Meat\r\ntreated thus is juicy and well-flavoured, when cooked, as it retains\r\nmost of its savoury constituents. On the other hand, if the piece of\r\nmeat be set on the fire with cold water, and this slowly heated to\r\nboiling, the flesh undergoes a loss of soluble and nutritious\r\nsubstances, while, as a matter of course, the soup becomes richer in\r\nthese matters. The albumen is gradually dissolved from the surface to\r\nthe centre; the fibre loses, more or less, its quality of shortness or\r\ntenderness, and becomes hard and tough: the thinner the piece of meat\r\nis, the greater is its loss of savoury constituents. In order to obtain\r\nwell-flavoured and eatable meat, we must relinquish the idea of making\r\ngood soup from it, as that mode of boiling which yields the best soup\r\ngives the driest, toughest, and most vapid meat. Slow boiling whitens\r\nthe meat; and, we suspect, that it is on this account that it is in such\r\nfavour with the cooks. The wholesomeness of food is, however, a matter\r\nof much greater moment than the appearance it presents on the table. It\r\nshould be borne in mind, that the whiteness of meat that has been boiled\r\nslowly, is produced by the loss of some important alimentary properties.\r\n\r\n558. THE OBJECTIONS WE HAVE RAISED to the practice of putting meat on\r\nthe fire in cold water, apply with equal force to the practice of\r\nsoaking meat before cooking it, which is so strongly recommended by some\r\ncooks. Fresh meat ought never to be soaked, as all its most nutritive\r\nconstituents are soluble in water. Soaking, however, is an operation\r\nthat cannot be entirely dispensed with in the preparation of animal\r\nfood. Salted and dried meats require to be soaked for some time in water\r\nbefore they are cooked.\r\n\r\n559. FOR BOILING MEAT, the softer the water is, the better. When spring\r\nwater is boiled, the chalk which gives to it the quality of hardness, is\r\nprecipitated. This chalk stains the meat, and communicates to it an\r\nunpleasant earthy taste. When nothing but hard water can be procured, it\r\nshould be softened by boiling it for an hour or two before it is used\r\nfor culinary purposes.\r\n\r\n560. THE FIRE MUST BE WATCHED with great attention during the operation\r\nof boiling, so that its heat may be properly regulated. As a rule, the\r\npot should be kept in a simmering state; a result which cannot be\r\nattained without vigilance.\r\n\r\n561. THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH WATER BOILS, under usual circumstances, is\r\n212° Fahr. Water does not become hotter after it has begun to boil,\r\nhowever long or with whatever violence the boiling is continued. This\r\nfact is of great importance in cookery, and attention to it will save\r\nmuch fuel. Water made to boil in a gentle way by the application of a\r\nmoderate heat is just as hot as when it is made to boil on a strong fire\r\nwith the greatest possible violence. When once water has been brought to\r\nthe boiling point, the fire may be considerably reduced, as a very\r\ngentle heat will suffice to keep the water at its highest temperature.\r\n\r\n562. THE SCUM WHICH RISES to the surface of the pot during the operation\r\nof boiling must be carefully removed, otherwise it will attach itself to\r\nthe meat, and thereby spoil its appearance. The cook must not neglect to\r\nskim during the whole process, though by far the greater part of the\r\nscum rises at first. The practice of wrapping meat in a cloth may be\r\ndispensed with if the skimming be skillfully managed. If the scum be\r\nremoved as fast as it rises, the meat will be cooked clean and pure, and\r\ncome out of the vessel in which it was boiled, much more delicate and\r\nfirm than when cooked in a cloth.\r\n\r\n563. WHEN TAKEN FROM THE POT, the meat must be wiped with a clean cloth,\r\nor, what will be found more convenient, a sponge previously dipped in\r\nwater and wrung dry. The meat should not be allowed to stand a moment\r\nlonger than necessary, as boiled meat, as well as roasted, cannot be\r\neaten too hot.\r\n\r\n564. THE TIME ALLOWED FOR THE OPERATION OF BOILING must be regulated\r\naccording to the size and quality of the meat. As a general rule, twenty\r\nminutes, reckoning from the moment when the boiling commences, may be\r\nallowed for every pound of meat. All the best authorities, however,\r\nagree in this, that the longer the boiling the more perfect the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n565. A FEW OBSERVATIONS ON THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF SALTED MEAT may be\r\nproperly introduced in this place. Every housewife knows that dry salt\r\nin contact with fresh meat gradually becomes fluid brine. The\r\napplication of salt causes the fibres of the meat to contract, and the\r\njuice to flow out from its pores: as much as one-third of the juice of\r\nthe meat is often forced out in this manner. Now, as this juice is pure\r\nextract of meat, containing albumen, osmazome, and other valuable\r\nprinciples, it follows that meat which has been preserved by the action\r\nof salt can never have the nutritive properties of fresh meat.\r\n\r\n566. THE VESSELS USED FOR BOILING should be made of cast-iron, well\r\ntinned within, and provided with closely-fitting lids. They must be kept\r\nscrupulously clean, otherwise they will render the meat cooked in them\r\nunsightly and unwholesome. Copper pans, if used at all, should be\r\nreserved for operations that are performed with rapidity; as, by long\r\ncontact with copper, food may become dangerously contaminated. The\r\nkettle in which a joint is dressed should be large enough to allow room\r\nfor a good supply of water; if the meat be cramped and be surrounded\r\nwith but little water, it will be stewed, not boiled.\r\n\r\n567. IN STEWING, IT IS NOT REQUISITE to have so great a heat as in\r\nboiling. A gentle simmering in a small quantity of water, so that the\r\nmeat is stewed almost in its own juices, is all that is necessary. It is\r\na method much used on the continent, and is wholesome and economical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILING-POT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEWPAN.]\r\n\r\n    Two useful culinary vessels are represented above. One is a\r\n    boiling-pot, in which large joints may be boiled; the other is a\r\n    stewpan, with a closely-fitting lid, to which is attached a long\r\n    handle; so that the cover can be removed without scalding the\r\n    fingers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOT-PLATE.]\r\n\r\n568. THE HOT-PLATE is a modern improvement on the old kitchen ranges,\r\nbeing used for boiling and stewing. It is a plate of cast iron, having a\r\nclosed fire burning beneath it, by which it is thoroughly well heated.\r\nOn this plate are set the various saucepans, stewpans, &c.; and, by this\r\nconvenient and economical method, a number of dishes may be prepared at\r\none time. The culinary processes of braising and stewing are, in this\r\nmanner, rendered more gradual, and consequently the substance acted on\r\nbecomes more tender, and the gravy is not so much reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REVOLVING GRIDIRON.]\r\n\r\n569. GENERALLY SPEAKING, small dishes only are prepared by this mode of\r\ncooking; amongst these, the beef-steak and mutton chop of the solitary\r\nEnglish diner may be mentioned as celebrated all the world over. Our\r\nbeef-steak, indeed, has long crossed the Channel; and, with a view of\r\npleasing the Britons, there is in every _carte_ at every French\r\nrestaurant, by the side of _à la Marengo_, and _à la Mayonnaise,--bifteck\r\nd'Angleterre_. In order to succeed in a broil, the cook must have a\r\nbright, clear fire; so that the surface of the meat may be quickly heated.\r\nThe result of this is the same as that obtained in roasting; namely, that\r\na crust, so to speak, is formed outside, and thus the juices of the meat\r\nare retained. The appetite of an invalid, so difficult to minister to, is\r\noften pleased with a broiled dish, as the flavour and sapidity of the meat\r\nare so well preserved.\r\n\r\n570. THE UTENSILS USED FOR BROILING need but little description. The\r\ncommon gridiron, for which see engraving at No. 68, is the same as it\r\nhas been for ages past, although some little variety has been introduced\r\ninto its manufacture, by the addition of grooves to the bars, by means\r\nof which the liquid fat is carried into a small trough. One point it is\r\nwell to bear in mind, viz., that the gridiron should be kept in a\r\ndirection slanting towards the cook, so that as little fat as possible\r\nmay fall into the fire. It has been observed, that broiling is the most\r\ndifficult manual office the general cook has to perform, and one that\r\nrequires the most unremitting attention; for she may turn her back upon\r\nthe stewpan or the spit, but the gridiron can never be left with\r\nimpunity. The revolving gridiron, shown in the engraving, possesses some\r\nadvantages of convenience, which will be at once apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRYING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAUTÉ PAN.]\r\n\r\n571. THIS VERY FAVOURITE MODE OF COOKING may be accurately described as\r\nboiling in fat or oil. Substances dressed in this way are generally well\r\nreceived, for they introduce an agreeable variety, possessing, as they\r\ndo, a peculiar flavour. By means of frying, cooks can soon satisfy many\r\nrequisitions made on them, it being a very expeditious mode of preparing\r\ndishes for the table, and one which can be employed when the fire is not\r\nsufficiently large for the purposes of roasting and boiling. The great\r\npoint to be borne in mind in frying, is that the liquid must be hot\r\nenough to act instantaneously, as all the merit of this culinary\r\noperation lies in the invasion of the boiling liquid, which carbonizes\r\nor burns, at the very instant of the immersion of the body placed in it.\r\nIt may be ascertained if the fat is heated to the proper degree, by\r\ncutting a piece of bread and dipping it in the frying-pan for five or\r\nsix seconds; and if it be firm and of a dark brown when taken out, put\r\nin immediately what you wish to prepare; if it be not, let the fat be\r\nheated until of the right temperature. This having been effected,\r\nmoderate the fire, so that the action may not be too hurried, and that\r\nby a continuous heat the juices of the substance may be preserved, and\r\nits flavour enhanced.\r\n\r\n572. THE PHILOSOPHY OF FRYING consists in this, that liquids subjected\r\nto the action of fire do not all receive the same quantity of heat.\r\nBeing differently constituted in their nature, they possess different\r\n\"capacities for caloric.\" Thus, you may, with impunity, dip your finger\r\nin boiling spirits of wine; you would take it very quickly from boiling\r\nbrandy, yet more rapidly from water; whilst the effects of the most\r\nrapid immersion in boiling oil need not be told. As a consequence of\r\nthis, heated fluids act differently on the sapid bodies presented to\r\nthem. Those put in water, dissolve, and are reduced to a soft mass; the\r\nresult being _bouillon_, stock, &c. (_see_ No. 103). Those substances,\r\non the contrary, treated with oil, harden, assume a more or less deep\r\ncolour, and are finally carbonized. The reason of these different\r\nresults is, that, in the first instance, water dissolves and extracts\r\nthe interior juices of the alimentary substances placed in it; whilst,\r\nin the second, the juices are preserved; for they are insoluble in oil.\r\n\r\n573. IT IS TO BE ESPECIALLY REMEMBERED, in connection with frying, that\r\nall dishes fried in fat should be placed before the fire on a piece of\r\nblotting-paper, or sieve reversed, and there left for a few minutes, so\r\nthat any superfluous greasy moisture may be removed.\r\n\r\n574. THE UTENSILS USED FOR THE PURPOSES OF FRYING are confined to\r\nfrying-pans, although these are of various sizes; and, for small and\r\ndelicate dishes, such as collops, fritters, pancakes, &c., the _sauté_\r\npan, of which we give an engraving, is used.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOKING BY GAS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GAS STOVE.]\r\n\r\n575. GAS-COOKING can scarcely now be considered a novelty,--many\r\nestablishments, both small and large, have been fitted with apparatus\r\nfor cooking by this mode, which undoubtedly exhibits some advantages.\r\nThus the heat may be more regularly supplied to the substance cooking,\r\nand the operation is essentially a clean one, because there can be no\r\ncinders or other dirt to be provided for. Some labour and attention\r\nnecessary, too, with a coal fire or close stove, may be saved; and,\r\nbesides this, it may, perhaps, be said that culinary operations are\r\nreduced, by this means, to something like a certainty.\r\n\r\n576. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, WE THINK, MANY OBJECTIONS to this mode of\r\ncooking, more especially when applied to small domestic establishments.\r\nFor instance, the ingenious machinery necessary for carrying it out,\r\nrequires cooks perfectly conversant with its use; and if the gas, when\r\nthe cooking operations are finished, be not turned off, there will be a\r\nlarge increase in the cost of cooking, instead of the economy which it\r\nhas been supposed to bring. For large establishments, such as some of\r\nthe immense London warehouses, where a large number of young men have to\r\nbe catered for daily, it may be well adapted, as it is just possible\r\nthat a slight increase in the supply of gas necessary for a couple of\r\njoints, may serve equally to cook a dozen dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nROASTING.\r\n\r\n577. OF THE VARIOUS METHODS OF PREPARING MEAT, ROASTING is that which\r\nmost effectually preserves its nutritive qualities. Meat is roasted by\r\nbeing exposed to the direct influence of the fire. This is done by\r\nplacing the meat before an open grate, and keeping it in motion to\r\nprevent the scorching on any particular part. When meat is properly\r\nroasted, the outer layer of its albumen is coagulated, and thus presents\r\na barrier to the exit of the juice. In roasting meat, the heat must be\r\nstrongest at first, and it should then be much reduced. To have a good\r\njuicy roast, therefore, the fire must be red and vigorous at the very\r\ncommencement of the operation. In the most careful roasting, some of the\r\njuice is squeezed out of the meat: this evaporates on the surface of the\r\nmeat, and gives it a dark brown colour, a rich lustre, and a strong\r\naromatic taste. Besides these effects on the albumen and the expelled\r\njuice, roasting converts the cellular tissue of the meat into gelatine,\r\nand melts the fat out of the fat-cells.\r\n\r\n578. IF A SPIT is used to support the meat before the fire, it should be\r\nkept quite bright. Sand and water ought to be used to scour it with, for\r\nbrickdust and oil may give a disagreeable taste to the meat. When well\r\nscoured, it must be wiped quite dry with a clean cloth; and, in spitting\r\nthe meat, the prime parts should be left untouched, so as to avoid any\r\ngreat escape of its juices.\r\n\r\n579. KITCHENS IN LARGE ESTABLISHMENTS are usually fitted with what are\r\ntermed \"smoke-jacks.\" By means of these, several spits, if required, may\r\nbe turned at the same time. This not being, of course, necessary in\r\nsmaller establishments, a roasting apparatus, more economical in its\r\nconsumption of coal, is more frequently in use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOTTLE-JACK, WITH WHEEL AND HOOK.]\r\n\r\n580. THE BOTTLE-JACK, of which we here give an illustration, with the\r\nwheel and hook, and showing the precise manner of using it, is now\r\ncommonly used in many kitchens. This consists of a spring inclosed in a\r\nbrass cylinder, and requires winding up before it is used, and\r\nsometimes, also, during the operation of roasting. The joint is fixed to\r\nan iron hook, which is suspended by a chain connected with a wheel, and\r\nwhich, in its turn, is connected with the bottle-jack. Beneath it stands\r\nthe dripping-pan, which we have also engraved, together with the\r\nbasting-ladle, the use of which latter should not be spared; as there\r\ncan be no good roast without good basting. \"Spare the rod, and spoil the\r\nchild,\" might easily be paraphrased into \"Spare the basting, and spoil\r\nthe meat.\" If the joint is small and light, and so turns unsteadily,\r\nthis may be remedied by fixing to the wheel one of the kitchen weights.\r\nSometimes this jack is fixed inside a screen; but there is this\r\nobjection to this apparatus,--that the meat cooked in it resembles the\r\nflavour of baked meat. This is derived from its being so completely\r\nsurrounded with the tin, that no sufficient current of air gets to it.\r\nIt will be found preferable to make use of a common meat-screen, such as\r\nis shown in the woodcut. This contains shelves for warming plates and\r\ndishes; and with this, the reflection not being so powerful, and more\r\nair being admitted to the joint, the roast may be very excellently\r\ncooked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRIPPING-PAN AND BASTING-LADLE.]\r\n\r\n581. IN STIRRING THE FIRE, or putting fresh coals on it, the\r\ndripping-pan should always be drawn back, so that there may be no danger\r\nof the coal, cinders, or ashes falling down into it.\r\n\r\n582. UNDER EACH PARTICULAR RECIPE there is stated the time required for\r\nroasting each joint; but, as a general rule, it may be here given, that\r\nfor every pound of meat, in ordinary-sized joints, a quarter of an hour\r\nmay be allotted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAT-SCREEN.]\r\n\r\n583. WHITE MEATS, AND THE MEAT OF YOUNG ANIMALS, require to be very well\r\nroasted, both to be pleasant to the palate and easy of digestion. Thus\r\nveal, pork, and lamb, should be thoroughly done to the centre.\r\n\r\n584. MUTTON AND BEEF, on the other hand, do not, generally speaking,\r\nrequire to be so thoroughly done, and they should be dressed to the\r\npoint, that, in carving them, the gravy should just run, but not too\r\nfreely. Of course in this, as in most other dishes, the tastes of\r\nindividuals vary; and there are many who cannot partake, with\r\nsatisfaction, of any joint unless it is what others would call\r\noverdressed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nQUADRUPEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON QUADRUPEDS.\r\n\r\n585. BY THE GENERAL ASSENT OF MANKIND, THE EMPIRE OF NATURE has been\r\ndivided into three kingdoms; the first consisting of minerals, the\r\nsecond of vegetables, and the third of animals. The Mineral Kingdom\r\ncomprises all substances which are without those organs necessary to\r\nlocomotion, and the due performance of the functions of life. They are\r\ncomposed of the accidental aggregation of particles, which, under\r\ncertain circumstances, take a constant and regular figure, but which are\r\nmore frequently found without any definite conformation. They also\r\noccupy the interior parts of the earth, as well as compose those huge\r\nmasses by which we see the land in some parts guarded against the\r\nencroachments of the sea. The Vegetable Kingdom covers and beautifies\r\nthe earth with an endless variety of form and colour. It consists of\r\norganized bodies, but destitute of the power of locomotion. They are\r\nnourished by means of roots; they breathe by means of leaves; and\r\npropagate by means of seed, dispersed within certain limits. The Animal\r\nKingdom consists of sentient beings, that enliven the external parts of\r\nthe earth. They possess the powers of voluntary motion, respire air, and\r\nare forced into action by the cravings of hunger or the parching of\r\nthirst, by the instincts of animal passion, or by pain. Like the\r\nvegetable kingdom, they are limited within the boundaries of certain\r\ncountries by the conditions of climate and soil; and some of the species\r\nprey upon each other. Linnaeus has divided them into six\r\nclasses;--Mammalia, Birds, Fishes, Amphibious Animals, Insects, and\r\nWorms. The three latter do not come within the limits of our domain; of\r\nfishes we have already treated, of birds we shall treat, and of mammalia\r\nwe will now treat.\r\n\r\n586. THIS CLASS OF ANIMALS embraces all those that nourish their young\r\nby means of lacteal glands, or teats, and are so constituted as to have\r\na warm or red blood. In it the whale is placed,--an order which, from\r\nexternal habits, has usually been classed with the fishes; but, although\r\nthis animal exclusively inhabits the water, and is supplied with fins,\r\nit nevertheless exhibits a striking alliance to quadrupeds. It has warm\r\nblood, and produces its young alive; it nourishes them with milk, and,\r\nfor that purpose, is furnished with teats. It is also supplied with\r\nlungs, and two auricles and two ventricles to the heart; all of which\r\nbring it still closer into an alliance with the quadrupedal species of\r\nthe animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n587. THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MAMMALIA have been frequently\r\nnoticed. The bodies of nearly the whole species are covered with hair, a\r\nkind of clothing which is both soft and warm, little liable to injury,\r\nand bestowed in proportion to the necessities of the animal and the\r\nnature of the climate it inhabits. In all the higher orders of animals,\r\nthe head is the principal seat of the organs of sense. It is there that\r\nthe eyes, the ears, the nose, and the mouth are placed. Through the last\r\nthey receive their nourishment. In it are the _teeth_, which, in most of\r\nthe mammalia, are used not only for the mastication of food, but as\r\nweapons of offence. They are inserted into two movable bones called\r\njaws, and the front teeth are so placed that their sharp edges may\r\neasily be brought in contact with their food, in order that its fibres\r\nmay readily be separated. Next to these, on each side, are situated the\r\ncanine teeth, or tusks, which are longer than the other teeth, and,\r\nbeing pointed, are used to tear the food. In the back jaws are placed\r\nanother form of teeth, called grinders. These are for masticating the\r\nfood; and in those animals that live on vegetables, they are flattened\r\nat the top; but, in carnivora, their upper surfaces are furnished with\r\nsharp-pointed protuberances. From the numbers, form, and disposition of\r\nthe teeth, the various genera of quadrupeds have been arranged. The\r\n_nose_ is a cartilaginous body, pierced with two holes, which are called\r\nnostrils. Through these the animal is affected by the sense of smell;\r\nand in some it is prominent, whilst in others it is flat, compressed,\r\nturned upwards, or bent downwards. In beasts of prey, it is frequently\r\nlonger than the lips; and in some other animals it is elongated into a\r\nmovable trunk or proboscis, whilst, in the rhinoceros tribe, it is armed\r\nwith a horn. The _eyes_ of quadrupeds are generally defended by movable\r\nlids, on the outer margins of which are fringes of hair, called\r\neyelashes. The opening of the pupil is in general circular; but to some\r\nspecies, as in those of the Cat and Hare, it is contracted into a\r\nperpendicular line, whilst in the Horse, the Ox, and a few others, it\r\nforms a transverse bar. The _ears_ are openings, generally accompanied\r\nwith a cartilage which defends and covers them, called the external\r\nears. In water-animals the latter are wanting; sound, in them, being\r\ntransmitted merely through orifices in the head, which have the name of\r\nauditory-holes. The most defenceless animals are extremely delicate in\r\nthe sense of hearing, as are likewise most beasts of prey. Most of the\r\nmammiferous animals _walk_ on four feet, which, at the extremities, are\r\nusually divided into toes or fingers. In some, however, the feet end in\r\na single corneous substance called a hoof. The toes of a few end in\r\nbroad, flat nails, and of most others, in pointed claws. Some, again,\r\nhave the toes connected by a membrane, which is adapted to those that\r\nare destined to pass a considerable portion of their lives in water.\r\nOthers, again, as in the Bat, have the digitations of the anterior feet\r\ngreatly elongated, the intervening space being filled by a membrane,\r\nwhich extends round the hinder legs and tail, and by means of which they\r\nare enabled to rise into the air. In Man, the hand alone comprises\r\nfingers, separate, free, and flexible; but Apes, and some other kinds of\r\nanimals, have fingers both to the hands and feet. These, therefore, are\r\nthe only animals that can hold movable objects in a single hand. Others,\r\nsuch as Rats and Squirrels, have the fingers sufficiently small and\r\nflexible to enable them to pick up objects; but they are compelled to\r\nhold them in both hands. Others, again, have the toes shorter, and must\r\nrest on the fore-feet, as is the case with dogs and cats when they wish\r\nto hold a substance firmly on the ground with their paws. There are\r\nstill others that have their toes united and drawn under the skin, or\r\nenveloped in corneous hoofs, and are thereby enabled to exercise no\r\nprehensile power whatever.\r\n\r\n588. ACCORDING TO THE DESIGN AND END OF NATURE, mammiferous animals are\r\ncalculated, when arrived at maturity, to subsist on various kinds of\r\nfood,--some to live wholly upon flesh, others upon grain, herbs, or\r\nfruits; but in their infant state, milk is the appropriate food of the\r\nwhole. That this food may never fail them, it is universally ordained,\r\nthat the young should no sooner come into the world, than the milk\r\nshould flow in abundance into the members with which the mother is\r\nsupplied for the secretion of that nutritious fluid. By a wonderful\r\ninstinct of Nature, too, the young animal, almost as soon as it has come\r\ninto life, searches for the teat, and knows perfectly, at the first,\r\nhow, by the process of suction, it will be able to extract the fluid\r\nnecessary to its existence.\r\n\r\n589. IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY OF NATURE, this class of animals seems\r\ndestined to preserve a constant equilibrium in the number of animated\r\nbeings that hold their existence on the surface of the earth. To man\r\nthey are immediately useful in various ways. Some of their bodies afford\r\nhim food, their skin shoes, and their fleece clothes. Some of them unite\r\nwith him in participating the dangers of combat with an enemy, and\r\nothers assist him in the chase, in exterminating wilder sorts, or\r\nbanishing them from the haunts of civilization. Many, indeed, are\r\ninjurious to him; but most of them, in some shape or other, he turns to\r\nhis service. Of these there is none he has made more subservient to his\r\npurposes than the common ox, of which there is scarcely a part that he\r\nhas not been able to convert into some useful purpose. Of the horns he\r\nmakes drinking-vessels, knife-handles, combs, and boxes; and when they\r\nare softened by means of boiling water, he fashions them into\r\ntransparent plates for lanterns. This invention is ascribed to King\r\nAlfred, who is said to have been the first to use them to preserve his\r\ncandle time-measures from the wind. Glue is made of the cartilages,\r\ngristles, and the finer pieces of the parings and cuttings of the hides.\r\nTheir bone is a cheap substitute for ivory. The thinnest of the\r\ncalf-skins are manufactured into vellum. Their blood is made the basis\r\nof Prussian blue, and saddlers use a fine sort of thread prepared from\r\ntheir sinews. The hair is used in various valuable manufactures; the\r\nsuet, fat, and tallow, are moulded into candles; and the milk and cream\r\nof the cow yield butter and cheese. Thus is every part of this animal\r\nvaluable to man, who has spared no pains to bring it to the highest\r\nstate of perfection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHORT-HORN COW.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHORT-HORN BULL.]\r\n\r\n590. AMONG THE VARIOUS BREEDS OF THE OX, upon which man has bestowed his\r\nhighest powers of culture, there is now none takes a higher place than\r\nthat known by the name of Short-Horns. From the earliest ages, Great\r\nBritain has been distinguished for the excellence of her native breeds\r\nof cattle, and there are none in England that have obtained greater\r\ncelebrity than those which have this name, and which originated, about\r\nseventy years ago, on the banks of the Tees. Thence they have spread\r\ninto the valleys of the Tweed; thence to the Lothians, in Scotland; and\r\nsouthward, into the fine pastures of England. They are now esteemed the\r\nmost profitable breed of cattle, as there is no animal which attains\r\nsooner to maturity, and none that supplies meat of a superior quality.\r\nThe value of some of the improved breeds is something enormous. At the\r\nsale of Mr. Charles Colling, a breeder in Yorkshire, in 1810, his bull\r\n\"Comet\" sold for 1,000 guineas. At the sale of Earl Spencer's herd in\r\n1846, 104 cows, heifers, and calves, with nineteen bulls, fetched\r\n£8,468. 5s.; being an average of £68. 17s. apiece. The value of such\r\nanimals is scarcely to be estimated by those who are unacquainted with\r\nthe care with which they are tended, and with the anxious attention\r\nwhich is paid to the purity of their breed. A modern writer, well\r\nacquainted with this subject, says, \"There are now, at least, five\r\nhundred herds, large and small, in this kingdom, and from six to seven\r\nthousand head registered every alternate year in the herd-book.\" The\r\nnecessity for thus recording the breeds is greater than might, at first\r\nsight, be imagined, as it tends directly to preserve the character of\r\nthe cattle, while it sometimes adds to the value and reputation of the\r\nanimal thus entered. Besides, many of the Americans, and large\r\npurchasers for the foreign market, will not look at an animal without\r\nthe breeder has taken care to qualify him for such reference. Of\r\nshort-horned stock, there is annually sold from £40,000 to £50,000 worth\r\nby public auction, independent of the vast numbers disposed of by\r\nprivate contract. The brood is highly prized in Belgium, Prussia,\r\nFrance, Italy, and Russia; it is imported into most of the British\r\ncolonies, and is greatly esteemed both for its meat and its dairy\r\nproduce, wherever it is known. The quickness with which it takes on\r\nflesh, and the weight which it frequently makes, are well known; but we\r\nmay mention that it is not uncommon to tee steers of from four to five\r\nyears old realize a weight of from 800 to 1,000 lbs. Such animals\r\ncommand from the butcher from £30 to £40 per head, according to the\r\nquality; whilst others, of two or three years old, and, of course, of\r\nless Weight, bring as much as £20 apiece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONG-HORN BULL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONG-HORN COW.]\r\n\r\n591. LONG-HORNS.--This is the prevailing breed in our midland counties\r\nand in Ireland; but they are greatly inferior to the short-horns, and\r\nare fast being supplanted by them. Even where they have been cultivated\r\nwith the nicest care and brought to the greatest perfection, they are\r\ninferior to the others, and must ultimately be driven from the farm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALDERNEY COW.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALDERNEY BULL.]\r\n\r\n592. THE ALDERNEY.--Among the dairy breeds of England, the Alderney\r\ntakes a prominent place, not on account of the quantity of milk which it\r\nyields, but on account of the excellent quality of the cream and butter\r\nwhich are produced from it. Its docility is marvellous, and in\r\nappearance it greatly resembles the Ayrshire breed of Scotland, the\r\nexcellence of which is supposed to be, in some degree, derived from a\r\nmixture of the Alderney blood with that breed. The distinction between\r\nthem, however, lies both in the quantity and quality of the milk which\r\nthey severally produce; that of the Alderney being rich in quality, and\r\nthat of the Ayrshire abundant in quantity. The merit of the former,\r\nhowever, ends with its milk, for as a grazer it is worthless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GALLOWAY BULL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GALLOWAY COW.]\r\n\r\n593. SCOTTISH BREEDS.--Of these the Kyloe, which belongs to the\r\nHighlands of Scotland; the Galloway, which has been called the Kyloe\r\nwithout horns; and the Ayrshire, are the breeds most celebrated. The\r\nfirst has kept his place, and on account of the compactness of his form,\r\nand the excellent quality of his flesh, he is a great favourite with\r\nbutchers who have a select family trade. It is alike unsuitable for the\r\ndairy and the arable farm; but in its native Highlands it attains to\r\ngreat perfection, thriving upon the scanty and coarse herbage which it\r\ngathers on the sides of the mountains. The Galloway has a larger frame,\r\nand when fattened makes excellent beef. But it has given place to the\r\nshort-horns in its native district, where turnip-husbandry is pursued\r\nwith advantage. The Ayrshire is peculiarly adapted for the dairy, and\r\nfor the abundance of its milk cannot be surpassed in its native\r\ndistrict. In this it stands unrivalled, and there is no other breed\r\ncapable of converting the produce of a poor soil into such fine butter\r\nand cheese. It is difficult to fatten, however, and its beef is of a\r\ncoarse quality. We have chosen these as among the principal\r\nrepresentative breeds of the ox species; but there are other breeds\r\nwhich, at all events, have a local if not a general celebrity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE OF BEEF, SHOWING THE SEVERAL JOINTS.]\r\n\r\n594. The general Mode of Slaughtering Oxen in this country is by\r\nstriking them a smart blow with a hammer or poleaxe on the head, a\r\nlittle above the eyes. By this means, when the blow is skilfully given,\r\nthe beast is brought down at one blow, and, to prevent recovery, a cane\r\nis generally inserted, by which the spinal cord is perforated, which\r\ninstantly deprives the ox of all sensation of pain. In Spain, and some\r\nother countries on the continent, it is also usual to deprive oxen of\r\nlife by the operation of pithing or dividing the spinal cord in the\r\nneck, close to the back part of the head. This is, in effect, the same\r\nmode as is practised in the celebrated Spanish bull-fights by the\r\nmatador, and it is instantaneous in depriving the animal of sensation,\r\nif the operator be skilful. We hope and believe that those men whose\r\ndisagreeable duty it is to slaughter the \"beasts of the field\" to\r\nprovide meat for mankind, inflict as little punishment and cause as\r\nlittle suffering as possible.\r\n\r\n595. THE MANNER IN WHICH A SIDE OF BEEF is cut up in London, is shown in\r\nthe engraving on this page. In the metropolis, on account of the large\r\nnumber of its population possessing the means to indulge in the \"best of\r\neverything,\" the demand for the most delicate joints of meat is great,\r\nthe price, at the same time, being much higher for these than for the\r\nother parts. The consequence is, that in London the carcass is there\r\ndivided so as to obtain the greatest quantity of meat on the most\r\nesteemed joints. In many places, however, where, from a greater equality\r\nin the social condition and habits of the inhabitants, the demand and\r\nprices for the different parts of the carcasses are more equalized,\r\nthere is not the same reason for the butcher to cut the best joints so\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n596. THE MEAT ON THOSE PARTS OF THE ANIMAL in which the muscles are\r\nleast called into action, is most tender and succulent; as, for\r\ninstance, along the back, from the rump to the hinder part of the\r\nshoulder; whilst the limbs, shoulder, and neck, are the toughest,\r\ndriest, and least-esteemed.\r\n\r\n597. THE NAMES OF THE SEVERAL JOINTS in the hind and fore quarters of a\r\nside of beef, and the purposes for which they are used, are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nHIND QUARTER.\r\n\r\n1. Sirloin.--The two sirloins, cut together in one joint, form a baron;\r\nthis, when roasted, is the famous national dish of Englishmen, at\r\nentertainments, on occasion of rejoicing.\r\n\r\n2. Rump,--the finest part for steaks.\r\n\r\n3. Aitch-bone,--boiling piece.\r\n\r\n4. Buttock,--prime boiling piece.\r\n\r\n5. Mouse-round,--boiling or stewing.\r\n\r\n6. Hock,--stewing.\r\n\r\n7. Thick flank, cut with the udder-fat,--primest boiling piece.\r\n\r\n8. Thin flank,--boiling.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORE QUARTER.\r\n\r\n9. Five ribs, called the fore-rib.--This is considered the primest\r\nroasting piece.\r\n\r\n10. Four ribs, called the middle-rib,--greatly esteemed by housekeepers\r\nas the most economical joint for roasting.\r\n\r\n11. Two ribs, called the chuck-rib,--used for second quality of steaks.\r\n\r\n12. Leg-of-mutton piece,--the muscles of the shoulder dissected from the\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n13. Brisket, or breast,--used for boiling, after being salted.\r\n\r\n14. Neck, clod, and sticking-piece,--used for soups, gravies, stocks,\r\npies, and mincing for sausages.\r\n\r\n15. Shin,--stewing.\r\n\r\nThe following is a classification of the qualities of meat, according to\r\nthe several joints of beef, when cut up in the London manner.\r\n\r\n_First class_.--includes the sirloin, with the kidney suet (1), the\r\nrump-steak piece (2), the fore-rib (9).\r\n\r\n_Second class_.--The buttock (4), the thick flank (7), the middle-rib\r\n(10).\r\n\r\n_Third class_.--The aitch-bone (3), the mouse-round (5), the thin flank\r\n(8), the chuck (11), the leg-of-mutton piece (12), the brisket (13).\r\n\r\n_Fourth class_.--The neck, clod, and sticking-piece (14).\r\n\r\n_Fifth class_.--The hock (6), the shin (15).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n598. INGREDIENTS.--About 2 lbs. of cold roast beef, 2 small onions, 1\r\nlarge carrot or two small ones, 1 turnip, a small bunch of savoury\r\nherbs, salt and pepper to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of gravy, 3\r\ntablespoonfuls of ale, crust or mashed potatoes.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the beef in slices, allowing a small amount of fat to each\r\nslice; place a layer of this in the bottom of a pie-dish, with a portion\r\nof the onions, carrots, and turnips, which must be sliced; mince the\r\nherbs, strew them over the meat, and season with pepper and salt. Then\r\nput another layer of meat, vegetables, and seasoning; and proceed in\r\nthis manner until all the ingredients are used. Pour in the gravy and\r\nale (water may be substituted for the former, but it is not so nice),\r\ncover with a crust or mashed potatoes, and bake for 1/2 hour, or rather\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--It is as well to parboil the carrots and turnips before adding\r\nthem to the meat, and to use some of the liquor in which they were\r\nboiled as a substitute for gravy; that is to say, when there is no gravy\r\nat hand. Be particular to cut the onions in very _thin_ slices.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n599. INGREDIENTS.--Slices of cold roast beef, salt and pepper to taste,\r\n1 sliced onion, 1 teaspoonful of minced savoury herbs, 5 or 6\r\ntablespoonfuls of gravy or sauce of any kind, mashed potatoes.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Butter the sides of a deep dish, and spread mashed potatoes\r\nover the bottom of it; on this place layers of beef in thin slices (this\r\nmay be minced if there is not sufficient beef to cut into slices), well\r\nseasoned with pepper and salt, and a very little onion end herbs, which\r\nshould be previously fried of a nice brown; then put another layer of\r\nmashed potatoes, and beef, and other ingredients, as before; pour in the\r\ngravy or sauce, cover the whole with another layer of potatoes, and bake\r\nfor 1/2 hour. This may be served in the dish, or turned out.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the cold beef, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--A large pie-dish full for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    BEEF.--The quality of beef depends on various circumstances;\r\n    such as the age, the sex, the breed of the animal, and also on\r\n    the food upon which it has been raised. Bull beef is, in\r\n    general, dry and tough, and by no means possessed of an\r\n    agreeable flavour; whilst the flesh of the ox is not only highly\r\n    nourishing and digestible, but, if not too old, extremely\r\n    agreeable. The flesh of the cow is, also, nourishing, but it is\r\n    not so agreeable as that of the ox, although that of a heifer is\r\n    held in high estimation. The flesh of the smaller breeds is much\r\n    sweeter than that of the larger, which is best when the animal\r\n    is about seven years old. That of the smaller breeds is best at\r\n    about five years, and that of the cow can hardly be eaten too\r\n    young.\r\n\r\nBAKED BEEF-STEAK PUDDING.\r\n\r\n600. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of flour, 2 eggs, not quite 1 pint of milk,\r\nsalt to taste, 1-1/2 lb. of rump-steaks, 1 kidney, pepper and salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the steaks into nice square pieces, with a small quantity\r\nof fat, and the kidney divide into small pieces. Make a batter of flour,\r\neggs, and milk in the above proportion; lay a little of it at the bottom\r\nof a pie-dish; then put in the steaks and kidney, which should be well\r\nseasoned with pepper and salt, and pour over the remainder of the\r\nbatter, and bake for 1-1/2 hour in a brisk but not fierce oven.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 2s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF A LA MODE.\r\n\r\n(_Economical_.)\r\n\r\n601. INGREDIENTS.--About 3 lbs. of clod or sticking of beef, 2 oz. of\r\nclarified dripping, 1 large onion, flour, 2 quarts of water, 12 berries\r\nof allspice, 2 bay-leaves, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole black pepper, salt\r\nto taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the beef into small pieces, and roll them in flour; put the\r\ndripping into a stewpan with the onion, which should be sliced thin. Let\r\nit get quite hot; lay in the pieces of beef, and stir them well about.\r\nWhen nicely browned all over, add _by degrees_ boiling water in the\r\nabove proportion, and, as the water is added, keep the whole well\r\nstirred. Put in the spice, bay-leaves, and seasoning, cover the stewpan\r\nclosely, and set it by the side of the fire to stew very _gently_, till\r\nthe meat becomes quite tender, which will be in about 3 hours, when it\r\nwill be ready to serve. Remove the bay-leaves before it is sent to\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF A LA MODE.\r\n\r\n602. INGREDIENTS.--6 or 7 lbs. of the thick flank of beef, a few slices\r\nof fat bacon, 1 teacupful of vinegar, black pepper, allspice, 2 cloves\r\nwell mixed and finely pounded, making altogether 1 heaped teaspoonful;\r\nsalt to taste, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, all finely\r\nminced and well mixed; 3 onions, 2 large carrots, 1 turnip, 1 head of\r\ncelery, 1-1/2 pint of water, 1 glass of port wine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice and fry the onions of a pale brown, and cut up the other\r\nvegetables in small pieces, and prepare the beef for stewing in the\r\nfollowing manner:--Choose a fine piece of beef, cut the bacon into long\r\nslices, about an inch in thickness, dip them into vinegar, and then into\r\na little of the above seasoning of spice, &c., mixed with the same\r\nquantity of minced herbs. With a sharp knife make holes deep enough to\r\nlet in the bacon; then rub the beef over with the remainder of the\r\nseasoning and herbs, and bind it up in a nice shape with tape. Have\r\nready a well-tinned stewpan (it should not be much larger than the piece\r\nof meat you are cooking), into which put the beef, with the vegetables,\r\nvinegar, and water. Let it simmer _very gently_ for 5 hours, or rather\r\nlonger, should the meat not be extremely tender, and turn it once or\r\ntwice. When ready to serve, take out the beef, remove the tape, and put\r\nit on a hot dish. Skim off every particle of fat from the gravy, add the\r\nport wine, just let it boil, pour it over the beef, and it is ready to\r\nserve. Great care must be taken that this does not boil fast, or the\r\nmeat will be tough and tasteless; it should only just bubble. When\r\nconvenient, all kinds of stews, &c., should be cooked on a hot-plate, as\r\nthe process is so much more gradual than on an open fire.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 hours, or rather more.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 7d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but more suitable for a winter dish.\r\n\r\n    GOOD MEAT.--The lyer of meat when freshly killed, and the\r\n    animal, when slaughtered, being in a state of perfect health,\r\n    adheres firmly to the bones. Beef of the best quality is of a\r\n    deep-red colour; and when the animal has approached maturity,\r\n    and been well fed, the lean is intermixed with fat, giving it\r\n    the mottled appearance which is so much esteemed. It is also\r\n    full of juice, which resembles in colour claret wine. The fat of\r\n    the best beef is of a firm and waxy consistency, of a colour\r\n    resembling that of the finest grass butter; bright in\r\n    appearance, neither greasy nor friable to the touch, but\r\n    moderately unctuous, in a medium degree between the\r\n    last-mentioned properties.\r\n\r\nBEEF-STEAKS AND OYSTER SAUCE.\r\n\r\n603. INGREDIENTS.--3 dozen oysters, ingredients for oyster sauce (see\r\nNo. 492), 2 lbs. of rump-steak, seasoning to taste of pepper and salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the oyster sauce by recipe No. 492, and when that is\r\nready, put it by the side of the fire, but do not let it keep boiling.\r\nHave the steaks cut of an equal thickness, broil them over a very clear\r\nfire, turning them often, that the gravy may not escape. In about 8\r\nminutes they will be done, then put them on a very hot dish; smother\r\nwith the oyster sauce, and the remainder send to table in a tureen.\r\nServe quickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 8 to 10 minutes, according to the thickness of the steak.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF-STEAK PIE.\r\n\r\n604. INGREDIENTS.--3 lbs. of rump-steak, seasoning to taste of salt,\r\ncayenne, and black pepper, crust, water, the yolk of an egg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the steaks cut from a rump that has hung a few days, that\r\nthey may be tender, and be particular that every portion is perfectly\r\nsweet. Cut the steaks into pieces about 3 inches long and 2 wide,\r\nallowing a _small_ piece of fat to each piece of lean, and arrange the\r\nmeat in layers in a pie-dish. Between each layer sprinkle a seasoning of\r\nsalt, pepper, and, when liked, a few grains of cayenne. Fill the dish\r\nsufficiently with meat to support the crust, and to give it a nice\r\nraised appearance when baked, and not to look flat and hollow. Pour in\r\nsufficient water to half fill the dish, and border it with paste (see\r\nPastry); brush it over with a little water, and put on the cover;\r\nslightly press down the edges with the thumb, and trim off close to the\r\ndish. Ornament the pie with leaves, or pieces of paste cut in any shape\r\nthat fancy may direct, brush it over with the beaten yolk of an egg;\r\nmake a hole in the top of the crust, and bake in a hot oven for about\r\n1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Time_.--In a hot oven, 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this size, 3s 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\nNote.--Beef-steak pies may be flavoured in various ways, with oysters\r\nand their liquor, mushrooms, minced onions, &c. For family pies, suet\r\nmay be used instead of butter or lard for the crust, and clarified\r\nbeef-dripping answers very well where economy is an object. Pieces of\r\nunderdone roast or boiled meat may in pies be used very advantageously;\r\nbut always remove the bone from pie-meat, unless it be chicken or game.\r\nWe have directed that the meat shall be cut smaller than is usually the\r\ncase; for on trial we have found it much more tender, more easily\r\nhelped, and with more gravy, than when put into the dish in one or two\r\nlarge steaks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHERRY PUDDING DISH.]\r\n\r\nBEEF-STEAK AND KIDNEY PUDDING.\r\n\r\n605. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of rump-steak, 2 kidneys, seasoning to taste\r\nof salt and black pepper, suet crust made with milk (see Pastry), in the\r\nproportion of 6 oz. of suet to each 1 lb. of flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure some tender rump steak (that which has been hung a\r\nlittle time), and divide it into pieces about an inch square, and cut\r\neach kidney into 8 pieces. Line the dish (of which we have given an\r\nengraving) with crust made with suet and flour in the above proportion,\r\nleaving a small piece of crust to overlap the edge. Then cover the\r\nbottom with a portion of the steak and a few pieces of kidney; season\r\nwith salt and pepper (some add a little flour to thicken the gravy, but\r\nit is not necessary), and then add another layer of steak, kidney, and\r\nseasoning. Proceed in this manner till the dish is full, when pour in\r\nsufficient water to come within 2 inches of the top of the basin.\r\nMoisten the edges of the crust, cover the pudding over, press the two\r\ncrusts together, that the gravy may not escape, and turn up the\r\noverhanging paste. Wring out a cloth in hot water, flour it, and tie up\r\nthe pudding; put it into boiling water, and let it boil for at least 4\r\nhours. If the water diminishes, always replenish with some, hot in a\r\njug, as the pudding should be kept covered all the time, and not allowed\r\nto stop boiling. When the cloth is removed, cut out a round piece in the\r\ntop of the crust, to prevent the pudding bursting, and send it to table\r\nin the basin, either in an ornamental dish, or with a napkin pinned\r\nround it. Serve quickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--For a pudding with 2 lbs. of steak and 2 kidneys allow 4 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but more suitable in winter.\r\n\r\nNote.--Beef-steak pudding may be very much enriched by adding a few\r\noysters or mushrooms. The above recipe was contributed to this work by a\r\nSussex lady, in which county the inhabitants are noted for their savoury\r\npuddings. It differs from the general way of making them, as the meat is\r\ncut up into very small pieces and the basin is differently shaped: on\r\ntrial, this pudding will be found far nicer, and more full of gravy,\r\nthan when laid in large pieces in the dish.\r\n\r\n    BAD MEAT. In the flesh of animals slaughtered whilst suffering\r\n    acute inflammation or fever, the hollow fibres, or capillaries,\r\n    as they are called, which form the substance of the lyer, are\r\n    filled with congested and unassimilated animal fluid, which,\r\n    from its impurity, gives the lyer a dark colour, and produces a\r\n    tendency to rapid putrefaction. In a more advanced stage of such\r\n    disease, serous, and sometimes purulent matter, is formed in the\r\n    cellular tissues between the muscles of the flesh; and when such\r\n    is the case, nothing can be more poisonous than such abominable\r\n    carrion. In the flesh of animals killed whilst under the\r\n    influence of any disease of an emaciating effect, the lyer\r\n    adheres but slightly to the bones, with its fibres contracted\r\n    and dry; and the little fat that there may be is friable, and\r\n    shrunk within its integuments. The flesh of animals slaughtered\r\n    whilst under considerable depression of vital energy (as from\r\n    previous bleeding) has a diminished tendency to stiffen after\r\n    death, the feebleness of this tendency being in proportion to\r\n    the degree of depression. It presents, also, an unnatural blue\r\n    or pallid appearance, has a faint and slightly sour smell, and\r\n    soon becomes putrid. When an animal has died otherwise than by\r\n    slaughtering, its flesh is flaccid and clammy, emits a peculiar\r\n    faint and disagreeable smell, and, it need scarcely be added,\r\n    spontaneous decomposition proceeds very rapidly.\r\n\r\nBEEF-STEAKS WITH FRIED POTATOES, or BIFTEK AUX POMMES-DE-TERRE (a la\r\nmode Francaise).\r\n\r\n606. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of steak, 8 potatoes, 1/4 lb. of butter, salt\r\nand pepper to taste, 1 teaspoonful of minced herbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the butter into a frying or _sauté_ pan, set it over the\r\nfire, and let it get very hot; peel, and cut the potatoes into long thin\r\nslices; put them into the hot butter, and fry them till of a nice brown\r\ncolour. Now broil the steaks over a bright clear fire, turning them\r\nfrequently, that every part may be equally done: as they should not be\r\nthick, 5 minutes will broil them. Put the herbs and seasoning in the\r\nbutter the potatoes were fried in, pour it under the steak, and place\r\nthe fried potatoes round, as a garnish. To have this dish in perfection,\r\na portion of the fillet of the sirloin should be used, as the meat is\r\ngenerally so much more tender than that of the rump, and the steaks\r\nshould be cut about 1/3 of an inch in thickness.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes to broil the steaks, and about the same time to fry\r\nthe potatoes. _Average cost_, 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year; but not so good in warm weather, as the meat\r\ncannot hang to get tender.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AITCH-BONE OF BEEF.]\r\n\r\nBOILED AITCH-BONE OF BEEF.\r\n\r\n607. INGREDIENTS.--Beef, water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--After this joint has been in salt 5 or 6 days, it will be ready\r\nfor use, and will not take so long boiling: as a round, for it is not so\r\nsolid. Wash the meat, and, if too salt, soak it for a few hours,\r\nchanging the water once or twice, till the required freshness is\r\nobtained. Put into a saucepan, or boiling-pot, sufficient water to cover\r\nthe meat; set it over the fire, and when it boils, plunge in the joint\r\n(see No. 557), and let it boil up quickly. Now draw the pot to the side\r\nof the fire, and let the process be very gradual, as the water must only\r\nsimmer, or the meat will be hard and tough. Carefully remove the scum\r\nfrom the surface of the water, and continue doing this for a few minutes\r\nafter it first boils. Carrots and turnips are served with this dish, and\r\nsometimes suet dumplings, which may be boiled with the beef. Garnish\r\nwith a few of the carrots and turnips, and serve the remainder in a\r\nvegetable-dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--An aitch-bone of 10 lbs., 2-1/2 hours after the water boils;\r\none of 20 lbs., 4 hours. _Average cost_, 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--10 lbs. for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but best from September to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The liquor in which the meat has been boiled may be easily\r\nconverted into a very excellent pea-soup. It will require very few\r\nvegetables, as it will be impregnated with the flavour of those boiled\r\nwith the meat.\r\n\r\n    THE ACTION OF SALT ON MEAT.--The manner in which salt acts in\r\n    preserving meat is not difficult to understand. By its strong\r\n    affinity, it, in the first place, extracts the juices from the\r\n    substance of meat in sufficient quantity to form a saturated\r\n    solution with the water contained in the juice, and the meat\r\n    then absorbs the saturated brine in place of the juice extracted\r\n    by the salt. In this way, matter incapable of putrefaction takes\r\n    the places of that portion in the meat which is most perishable.\r\n    Such, however, is not the only office of salt as a means of\r\n    preserving meat; it acts also by its astringency in contracting\r\n    the fibres of the muscles, and so excludes the action of air on\r\n    the interior of the substance of the meat. The last-mentioned\r\n    operation of salt as an antiseptic is evinced by the diminution\r\n    of the volume of meat to which it is applied. The astringent\r\n    action of _saltpetre_ on meat is much greater than that of salt,\r\n    and thereby renders meat to which it is applied very hard; but,\r\n    in small quantities, it considerably assists the antiseptic\r\n    action of salt, and also prevents the destruction of the florid\r\n    colour of meat, which is caused by the application of salt.\r\n    Thus, it will be perceived, from the foregoing statement, that\r\n    the application of salt and saltpetre diminishes, in a\r\n    considerable degree, the nutritive, and, to some extent, the\r\n    wholesome qualities of meat; and, therefore, in their use, the\r\n    quantity applied should be as small as possible, consistent with\r\n    the perfect preservation of the meat.\r\n\r\nBOILED ROUND OF BEEF.\r\n\r\n608. INGREDIENTS.--Beef, water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--As a whole round of beef, generally speaking, is too large for\r\nsmall families, and very seldom required, we here give the recipe for\r\ndressing a portion of the silver side of the round. Take from 12 to 16\r\nlbs., after it has been in salt about 10 days; just wash off the salt,\r\nskewer it up in a nice round-looking form, and bind it with tape to keep\r\nthe skewers in their places. Put it in a saucepan of boiling water, as\r\nin the preceding recipe, set it upon a good fire, and when it begins to\r\nboil, carefully remove all scum from the surface, as, if this is not\r\nattended to, it sinks on to the meat, and when brought to table,\r\npresents a very unsightly appearance. When it is well skimmed, draw the\r\npot to the corner of the fire, and let it simmer very gently until done.\r\nRemove the tape and skewers, which should be replaced by a silver one;\r\npour over a little of the pot-liquor, and garnish with carrots. (_See_\r\ncoloured plate 2.) Carrots, turnips, parsnips, and sometimes suet\r\ndumplings, accompany this dish; and these may all be boiled with the\r\nbeef. The pot-liquor should be saved, and converted into pea-soup; and\r\nthe outside slices, which are generally hard, and of an uninviting\r\nappearance, may be out off before being sent to table, and potted. These\r\nmake an excellent relish for the breakfast or luncheon table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Part of a round of beef weighing 12 lbs., about 3 hours after\r\nthe water boils. _Average cost_, 8d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but more suitable for winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n609. SOYER'S RECIPE FOR PRESERVING THE GRAVY IN SALT MEAT, WHEN IT IS TO\r\nBE SERVED COLD.--Fill two tubs with cold water, into which throw a few\r\npounds of rough ice; and when the meat is done, put it into one of the\r\ntubs of ice-water; let it remain 1 minute, when take out, and put it\r\ninto the other tub. Fill the first tub again with water, and continue\r\nthis process for about 20 minutes; then set it upon a dish, and let it\r\nremain until quite cold. When cut, the fat will be as white as possible,\r\nbesides having saved the whole, of the gravy. If there is no ice, spring\r\nwater will answer the same purpose, but will require to be more\r\nfrequently changed.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The BRISKET and RUMP may be boiled by the above recipe; of\r\ncourse allowing more or less time, according to the size of the joint.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF CAKE.\r\n\r\n610. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast beef; to each pound of cold\r\nmeat allow 1/4 lb. of bacon or ham; seasoning to taste of pepper and\r\nsalt, 1 small bunch of minced savoury herbs, 1 or 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mince the beef very finely (if underdone it will be better),\r\nadd to it the bacon, which must also be chopped very small, and mix well\r\ntogether. Season, stir in the herbs, and bind with an egg, or 2 should 1\r\nnot be sufficient. Make it into small square cakes, about 1/2 inch\r\nthick, fry them in hot dripping, and serve in a dish with good gravy\r\npoured round them.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold meat, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED BEEF-STEAKS or RUMP-STEAKS.\r\n\r\n611. INGREDIENTS.--Steaks, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, salt\r\nto taste, 1 tablespoonful of good mushroom ketchup or Harvey's sauce.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--As the success of a good broil so much depends on the state of\r\nthe fire, see that it is bright and clear, and perfectly free from\r\nsmoke, and do not add any fresh fuel just before you require to use the\r\ngridiron. Sprinkle a little salt over the fire, put on the gridiron for\r\na few minutes, to get thoroughly hot through; rub it with a piece of\r\nfresh, suet, to prevent the meat from sticking, and lay on the steaks,\r\nwhich should be cut of an equal thickness, about 3/4 of an inch, or\r\nrather thinner, and level them by beating them as _little_ as possible\r\nwith a rolling-pin. Turn them frequently with steak-tongs (if these are\r\nnot at hand, stick a fork in the edge of the fat, that no gravy\r\nescapes), and in from 8 to 10 minutes they will be done. Have ready a\r\nvery hot dish, into which put the ketchup, and, when liked, a little\r\nminced shalot; dish up the steaks, rub them over with butter, and season\r\nwith pepper and salt. The exact time for broiling steaks must be\r\ndetermined by taste, whether they are liked underdone or well done; more\r\nthan from 8 to 10 minutes for a steak 3/4 inch in thickness, we think,\r\nwould spoil and dry up the juices of the meat. Great expedition is\r\nnecessary in sending broiled steaks to table; and, to have them in\r\nperfection, they should not be cooked till everything else prepared for\r\ndinner has been dished up, as their excellence entirely depends on their\r\nbeing served very hot. Garnish with scraped horseradish, or slices of\r\ncucumber. Oyster, tomato, onion, and many other sauces, are frequent\r\naccompaniments to rump-steak, but true lovers of this English dish\r\ngenerally reject all additions but pepper and salt.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--8 to 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1/2 lb. to each person; if the party consist\r\nentirely of gentlemen, 3/4 lb. will not be too much.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but not good in the height of summer, as the\r\nmeat cannot hang long enough to be tender.\r\n\r\n    DIFFERENT SEASONS FOR BEEF.--We have already stated (see No.\r\n    593) that the Scots breed of oxen, like the South-down in\r\n    mutton, stands first in excellence. It should be borne in mind,\r\n    however, that each county has its particular season, and that\r\n    the London and other large markets are always supplied by those\r\n    counties whose meat, from local circumstances, is in the best\r\n    condition at the time. Thus, the season in Norfolk, from which\r\n    the Scots come (these being the principal oxen bred by the\r\n    Norfolk and Suffolk graziers), commences about Christmas and\r\n    terminates about June, when this breed begins to fall off, their\r\n    place being taken by grass-fed oxen. A large quantity of most\r\n    excellent meat is sent to the \"dead markets\" from Scotland, and\r\n    some of the best London butchers are supplied from this source.\r\n\r\nBROILED BEEF AND MUSHROOM SAUCE.\r\n\r\n(Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n612. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 dozen small button mushrooms, 1 oz. of butter,\r\nsalt and cayenne to taste, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, mashed\r\npotatoes, slices of cold roast beef.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wipe the mushrooms free from grit with a piece of flannel, and\r\nsalt; put them in a stewpan with the butter, seasoning, and ketchup;\r\nstir over the fire until the mushrooms are quite done, when pour it in\r\nthe middle of mashed potatoes, browned. Then place round the potatoes\r\nslices of cold roast beef, nicely broiled, over a clear fire. In making\r\nthe mushroom sauce, the ketchup may be dispensed with, if there is\r\nsufficient gravy.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED BEEF AND OYSTER SAUCE (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n613. INGREDIENTS.--2 dozen oysters, 3 cloves, 1 blade of mace, 2 oz. of\r\nbutter, 1/2 teaspoonful of flour, cayenne and salt to taste, mashed\r\npotatoes, a few slices of cold roast beef.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the oysters in a stewpan, with their liquor strained; add\r\nthe cloves, mace, butter, flour, and seasoning, and let them simmer\r\ngently for 5 minutes. Have ready in the centre of a dish round walls of\r\nmashed potatoes, browned; into the middle pour the oyster sauce, quite\r\nhot, and round the potatoes place, in layers, slices of the beef, which\r\nshould be previously broiled over a nice clear fire.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s, 6d., exclusive of the cold meat.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED BEEF-BONES.\r\n\r\n614. INGREDIENTS.--The bones of ribs or sirloin; salt, pepper, and\r\ncayenne.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Separate the bones, taking care that the meat on them is not\r\ntoo thick in any part; sprinkle them well with the above seasoning, and\r\nbroil over a very clear fire. When nicely browned they are done; but do\r\nnot allow them to blacken.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DRESS A BULLOCK'S HEART.\r\n\r\n615. INGREDIENTS.--1 heart, stuffing of veal forcemeat, No. 417.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the heart into warm water to soak for 2 hours; then wipe it\r\nwell with a cloth, and, after cutting off the lobes, stuff the inside\r\nwith a highly-seasoned forcemeat (No. 417). Fasten it in, by means of a\r\nneedle and coarse thread; tie the heart up in paper, and set it before a\r\ngood fire, being very particular to keep it well basted, or it will eat\r\ndry, there being very little of its own fat. Two or three minutes before\r\nserving, remove the paper, baste well, and serve with good gravy and\r\nred-currant jelly or melted butter. If the heart is very large, it will\r\nrequire 2 hours, and, covered with a caul, may be baked as well as\r\nroasted.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Large heart, 2 hours. _Average cost_, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This is an excellent family dish, is very savoury, and, though\r\nnot seen at many good tables, may be recommended for its cheapness and\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUBBLE-AND-SQUEAK (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n616. INGREDIENTS.--A few thin slices of cold boiled beef; butter,\r\ncabbage, 1 sliced onion, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Fry the slices of beef gently in a little butter, taking care\r\nnot to dry them up. Lay them on a flat dish, and cover with fried\r\ngreens. The greens may be prepared from cabbage sprouts or green savoys.\r\nThey should be boiled till tender, well drained, minced, and placed,\r\ntill quite hot, in a frying-pan, with butter, a sliced onion, and\r\nseasoning of pepper and salt. When the onion is done, it is ready to\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold beef, 3d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLLARED BEEF.]\r\n\r\nCOLLARED BEEF.\r\n\r\n617. INGREDIENTS.--7 lbs. of the thin end of the flank of beef, 2 oz. of\r\ncoarse sugar, 6 oz. of salt, 1 oz, of saltpetre, 1 large handful of\r\nparsley minced, 1 dessertspoonful of minced sage, a bunch of savoury\r\nherbs, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded allspice; salt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose fine tender beef, but not too fat; lay it in a dish; rub\r\nin the sugar, salt, and saltpetre, and let it remain in the pickle for a\r\nweek or ten days, turning and rubbing it every day. Then bone it, remove\r\nall the gristle and the coarse skin of the inside part, and sprinkle it\r\nthickly with parsley, herbs, spice, and seasoning in the above\r\nproportion, taking care that the former are finely minced, and the\r\nlatter well pounded. Roll the meat up in a cloth as tightly as possible,\r\nin the same shape as shown in the engraving; bind it firmly with broad\r\ntape, and boil it gently for 6 hours. Immediately on taking it out of\r\nthe pot, put it under a good weight, without undoing it, and let it\r\nremain until cold. This dish is a very nice addition to the\r\nbreakfast-table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--6 hours. _Average cost_, for this quantity, 4s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--During the time the beef is in pickle, it should be kept cool,\r\nand regularly rubbed and turned every day.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF-COLLOPS.\r\n\r\n618. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of rump-steak, 1/4 lb. of butter, 1 pint of\r\ngravy (water may be substituted for this), salt and pepper to taste, 1\r\nshalot finely minced, 1/2 pickled walnut, 1 teaspoonful of capers.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the steak cut thin, and divide it in pieces about 3 inches\r\nlong; beat these with the blade of a knife, and dredge with flour. Put\r\nthem in a frying-pan with the butter, and let them fry for about 3\r\nminutes; then lay them in a small stewpan, and pour over them the gravy.\r\nAdd a piece of butter, kneaded with a little flour, put in the seasoning\r\nand all the other ingredients, and let the whole simmer, but not boil,\r\nfor 10 minutes. Serve in a hot covered dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINCED COLLOPS (an Entree).\r\n\r\n619. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of rump-steak, salt and pepper to taste, 2 oz.\r\nof butter, 1 onion minced, 1/4 pint of water, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nHarvey's sauce, or lemon-juice, or mushroom ketchup; 1 small bunch of\r\nsavoury herbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mince the beef and onion very small, and fry the latter in\r\nbutter until of a pale brown. Put all the ingredients together in a\r\nstewpan, and boil gently for about 10 minutes; garnish with sippets of\r\ntoasted bread, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 or 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRIED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n620. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of tolerably lean cold roast or boiled\r\nbeef, 3 oz. of butter, 2 onions, 1 wineglassful of beer, 1\r\ndessertspoonful of curry powder.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the beef into pieces about 1 inch square, put the butter\r\ninto a stewpan with the onions sliced, and fry them of a lightly-brown\r\ncolour. Add all the other ingredients, and stir gently over a brisk fire\r\nfor about 10 minutes. Should this be thought too dry, more beer, or a\r\nspoonful or two of gravy or water, may be added; but a good curry should\r\nnot be very thin. Place it in a deep dish, with an edging of dry boiled\r\nrice, in the same manner as for other curries.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes. _Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CLARIFY BEEF DRIPPING.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n621. Good and fresh dripping answers very well for basting everything\r\nexcept game and poultry, and, when well clarified, serves for frying\r\nnearly as well as lard; it should be kept in a cool place, and will\r\nremain good some time. To clarify it, put the dripping into a basin,\r\npour over it boiling water, and keep stirring the whole to wash away the\r\nimpurities. Let it stand to cool, when the water and dirty sediment will\r\nsettle at the bottom of the basin. Remove the dripping, and put it away\r\nin jars or basins for use.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER WAY.\r\n\r\n622. Put the dripping into a clean saucepan, and let it boil for a few\r\nminutes over a slow fire, and be careful to skim it well. Let it stand\r\nto cool a little, then strain it through a piece of muslin into jars for\r\nuse. Beef dripping is preferable to any other for cooking purposes, as,\r\nwith mutton dripping, there is liable to be a tallowy taste and smell.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST FILLET OF BEEF (Larded).\r\n\r\n623. INGREDIENTS.--About 4 lbs. of the inside fillet of the sirloin, 1\r\nonion, a small bunch of parsley, salt and pepper to taste, sufficient\r\nvinegar to cover the meat, glaze, Spanish sauce, No. 411.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Lard the beef with bacon, and put it into a pan with sufficient\r\nvinegar to cover it, with an onion sliced, parsley, and seasoning, and\r\nlet it remain in this pickle for 12 hours. Roast it before a nice clear\r\nfire for about 1-1/4 hour, and, when done, glaze it. Pour some Spanish\r\nsauce round the beef, and the remainder serve in a tureen. It may be\r\ngarnished with Spanish onions boiled and glazed.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. Average cost, exclusive of the sauce, 4s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRICANDEAU OF BEEF.\r\n\r\n624. INGREDIENTS.--About 3 lbs. of the inside fillet of the sirloin (a\r\npiece of the rump may be substituted for this), pepper and salt to\r\ntaste, 3 cloves, 2 blades of mace, 6 whole allspice, 1 pint of stock No.\r\n105, or water, 1 glass of sherry, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, 2 shalots,\r\nbacon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut some bacon into thin strips, and sprinkle over them a\r\nseasoning of pepper and salt, mixed with cloves, mace, and allspice,\r\nwell pounded. Lard the beef with these, put it into a stewpan with the\r\nstock or water, sherry, herbs, shalots, 2 cloves, and more pepper and\r\nsalt. Stew the meat gently until tender, when take it out, cover it\r\nclosely, skim off all the fat from the gravy, and strain it. Set it on\r\nthe fire, and boil, till it becomes a glaze. Glaze the larded side of\r\nthe beef with this, and serve on sorrel sauce, which is made as\r\nfollows:--Wash and pick some sorrel, and put it into a stewpan with only\r\nthe water that hangs about it. Keep stirring, to prevent its burning,\r\nand when done, lay it in a sieve to drain. Chop it, and stew it with a\r\nsmall piece of butter and 4 or 6 tablespoonfuls of good gravy, for an\r\nhour, and rub it through a tammy. If too acid, add a little sugar; and a\r\nlittle cabbage-lettuce boiled with the sorrel will be found an\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours to gently stew the meat.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 4s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED SALT BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n625. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of cold salt beef, pepper to taste, 1/4\r\nlb. of butter, mashed potatoes.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut any part of cold salt beef into thin slices, fry them\r\ngently in butter, and season with a little pepper. Have ready some very\r\nhot mashed potatoes, lay the slices of beef on them, and garnish with 3\r\nor 4 pickled gherkins. Cold salt beef, warmed in a little liquor from\r\nmixed pickle, drained, and served as above, will be found good.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 5 minutes. _Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED RUMP-STEAK.\r\n\r\n626. INGREDIENTS.--Steaks, butter or clarified dripping.\r\n\r\n_Mode_. Although broiling is a far superior method of cooking steaks to\r\nfrying them, yet, when the cook is not very expert, the latter mode may\r\nbe adopted; and, when properly done, the dish may really look very\r\ninviting, and the flavour be good. The steaks should be cut rather\r\nthinner than for broiling, and with a small quantity of fat to each. Put\r\nsome butter or clarified dripping into a frying-pan; let it get quite\r\nhot, then lay in the steaks. Turn them frequently until done, which will\r\nbe in about 8 minutes, or rather more, should the steaks be very thick.\r\nServe on a very hot dish, in which put a small piece of butter and a\r\ntablespoonful of ketchup, and season with pepper and salt. They should\r\nbe sent to table quickly, as, when cold, the steaks are entirely\r\nspoiled.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--8 minutes for a medium-sized steak, rather longer for a very\r\nthick one.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable all the year, but not good in summer, as the meat cannot\r\nhang to get tender._\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Where much gravy is liked, make it in the following manner:--As\r\nsoon as the steaks are done, dish them, pour a little boiling water into\r\nthe frying-pan, add a seasoning of pepper and salt, a small piece of\r\nbutter, and a tablespoonful of Harvey's sauce or mushroom ketchup. Hold\r\nthe pan over the fire for a minute or two, just let the gravy simmer,\r\nthen pour on the steak, and serve.\r\n\r\n    A FRENCHMAN'S OPINION OF BEEF. The following is translated from\r\n    a celebrated modern French work, the production of one who in\r\n    Paris enjoys a great reputation as cook and chemist:--The flesh\r\n    of the ox, to be in the best condition, should be taken from an\r\n    animal of from four to six years old, and neither too fat nor\r\n    too lean. This meat, which possesses in the highest degree the\r\n    most nutritive qualities, is generally easily digested; stock is\r\n    made from it, and it is eaten boiled, broiled, roasted, stewed,\r\n    braised, and in a hundred other different ways. Beef is the\r\n    foundation of stock, gravies, braises, &c.; its nutritious and\r\n    succulent gravy gives body and flavour to numberless ragoûts. It\r\n    is an exhaustless mine in the hands of a skilful artist, and is\r\n    truly the king of the kitchen. Without it, no soup, no gravy;\r\n    and its absence would produce almost a famine in the civilized\r\n    world!\r\n\r\nBEEF FRITTERS (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n627. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast beef, pepper and salt to\r\ntaste, 3/4 lb. of flour, 1/2 pint of water, 2 oz. of butter, the whites\r\nof 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix very smoothly, and by degrees, the flour with the above\r\nproportion of water; stir in 2 oz. of butter, which must be melted, but\r\nnot oiled, and, just before it is to be used, add the whites of two\r\nwell-whisked eggs. Should the batter be too thick, more water must be\r\nadded. Pare down the cold beef into thin shreds, season with pepper and\r\nsalt, and mix it with the batter. Drop a small quantity at a time into a\r\npan of boiling lard, and fry from 7 to 10 minutes, according to the\r\nsize. When done on one side, turn and brown them on the other. Let them\r\ndry for a minute or two before the fire, and serve on a folded napkin. A\r\nsmall quantity of finely-minced onions, mixed with the batter, is an\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 7 to 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 6d. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nHASHED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n628. INGREDIENTS.--Gravy saved from the meat, 1 teaspoonful of tomato\r\nsauce, 1 teaspoonful of Harvey's sauce, 1 teaspoonful of good mushroom\r\nketchup, 1/2 glass of port wine or strong ale, pepper and salt to taste,\r\na little flour to thicken, 1 onion finely minced, a few slices of cold\r\nroast beef.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients but the beef into a stewpan with\r\nwhatever gravy may have been saved from the meat the day it was roasted;\r\nlet these simmer gently for 10 minutes, then take the stewpan off the\r\nfire; let the gravy cool, and skim off the fat. Cut the beef into thin\r\nslices, dredge them with flour, and lay them in the gravy; let the whole\r\nsimmer gently for 5 minutes, but not boil, or the meat will be tough and\r\nhard. Serve very hot, and garnish with sippets of toasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes. _Average cost_, exclusive of the cold meat, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n629. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of ribs or sirloin of beef, 2 onions, 1\r\ncarrot, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 1/2 blade of\r\npounded mace, thickening of flour, rather more than 1 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take off all the meat from the bones of ribs or sirloin of\r\nbeef; remove the outside brown and gristle; place the meat on one side,\r\nand well stew the bones and pieces, with the above ingredients, for\r\nabout 2 hours, till it becomes a strong gravy, and is reduced to rather\r\nmore than 1/2 pint; strain this, thicken with a teaspoonful of flour,\r\nand let the gravy cool; skim off all the fat; lay in the meat, let it\r\nget hot through, but do not allow it to boil, and garnish with sippets\r\nof toasted bread. The gravy may be flavoured as in the preceding recipe.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold meat, 2d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Either of the above recipes may be served in walls of mashed\r\npotatoes browned; in which case the sippets should be omitted. Be\r\ncareful that hashed meat does not boil, or it will become tough.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PREPARE HUNG BEEF.\r\n\r\n630. This is preserved by salting and drying, either with or without\r\nsmoke. Hang up the beef 3 or 4 days, till it becomes tender, but take\r\ncare it does not begin to spoil; then salt it in the usual way, either\r\nby dry-salting or by brine, with bay-salt, brown sugar, saltpetre, and a\r\nlittle pepper and allspice; afterwards roll it tight in a cloth, and\r\nhang it up in a warm, but not hot place, for a fortnight or more, till\r\nit is sufficiently hard. If required to have a little of the smoky\r\nflavour, it may be hung for some time in a chimney-corner, or smoked in\r\nany other way: it will keep a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTER'S BEEF.\r\n\r\n631. INGREDIENTS.--For a round of beef weighing 25 lbs. allow 3 oz. of\r\nsaltpetre, 3 oz. of coarse sugar, 1 oz. of cloves, 1 grated nutmeg, 1/2\r\noz. of allspice, 1 lb. of salt, 1/2 lb. bay-salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the beef hang for 2 or 3 days, and remove the bone. Pound\r\nspices, salt, &c. in the above proportion, and let them be reduced to\r\nthe finest powder. Put the beef into a pan, rub all the ingredients well\r\ninto it, and turn and rub it every day for rather more than a fortnight.\r\nWhen it has been sufficiently long in pickle, wash the meat, bind it up\r\nsecurely with tape, and put it into a pan with 1/2 pint of water at the\r\nbottom; mince some suet, cover the top of the meat with it, and over the\r\npan put a common crust of flour and water; bake for 6 hours, and, when\r\ncold, remove the paste. Save the gravy that flows from it, as it adds\r\ngreatly to the flavour of hashes, stews, &c. The beef may be glazed and\r\ngarnished with meat jelly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--6 hours.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--In salting or pickling beef or pork for family consumption, it\r\nnot being generally required to be kept for a great length of time, a\r\nless quantity of salt and a larger quantity of other matters more\r\nadapted to retain mellowness in meat, may be employed, which could not\r\nbe adopted by the curer of the immense quantities of meat required to be\r\npreserved for victualling the shipping of this maritime country. Sugar,\r\nwhich is well known to possess the preserving principle in a very great\r\ndegree, without the pungency and astringency of salt, may be, and is,\r\nvery generally used in the preserving of meat for family consumption.\r\nAlthough it acts without corrugating or contracting the fibres of meat,\r\nas is the case in the action of salt, and, therefore, does not impair\r\nits mellowness, yet its use in sufficient quantities for preservative\r\neffect, without the addition of other antiseptics, would impart a\r\nflavour not agreeable to the taste of many persons. It may be used,\r\nhowever, together with salt, with the greatest advantage in imparting\r\nmildness and mellowness to cured meat, in a proportion of about one part\r\nby weight to four of the mixture; and, perhaps, now that sugar is so\r\nmuch lower in price than it was in former years, one of the obstructions\r\nto its more frequent use is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DRESS BEEF KIDNEY.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n632. INGREDIENTS.--1 kidney, clarified butter, pepper and salt to taste,\r\na small quantity of highly-seasoned gravy, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nlemon-juice, 1/4 teaspoonful of powdered sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the kidneys into neat slices, put them into warm water to\r\nsoak for 2 hours, and change the water 2 or 3 times; then put them on a\r\nclean cloth to dry the water from them, and lay them in a frying-pan\r\nwith some clarified butter, and fry them of a nice brown; season each\r\nside with pepper and salt, put them round the dish, and the gravy in the\r\nmiddle. Before pouring the gravy in the dish, add the lemon-juice and\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 5 to 10 minutes. _Average cost_, 9d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n633. INGREDIENTS.--1 kidney, 1 dessertspoonful of minced parsley, 1\r\nteaspoonful of minced shalot, salt and pepper to taste, 1/4 pint of\r\ngravy, No. 438, 3 tablespoonfuls of sherry.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take off a little of the kidney fat, mince it very fine, and\r\nput it in a frying-pan; slice the kidney, sprinkle over it parsley and\r\nshalots in the above proportion, add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and\r\nfry it of a nice brown. When it is done enough, dredge over a little\r\nflour, and pour in the gravy and sherry. Let it just simmer, but not\r\nboil any more, or the kidney would harden; serve very hot, and garnish\r\nwith croûtons. Where the flavour of the shalot is disliked, it may be\r\nomitted, and a small quantity of savoury herbs substituted for it.\r\n_Time_.--From 5 to 10 minutes, according to the thickness of the slices.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d. each. _Sufficient_ for 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n_A more Simple Method_.\r\n\r\n634. Cut the kidney into thin slices, flour them, and fry of a nice\r\nbrown. When done, make a gravy in the pan by pouring away the fat,\r\nputting in a small piece of butter, 1/4 pint of boiling water, pepper\r\nand salt, and a tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup. Let the gravy just\r\nboil up, pour over the kidney, and serve.\r\n\r\nBOILED MARROW-BONES.\r\n\r\n635. INGREDIENTS.--Bones, a small piece of common paste, a floured\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the bones neatly sawed into convenient sizes, and cover\r\nthe ends with a small piece of common crust, made with flour and water.\r\nOver this tie a floured cloth, and place them upright in a saucepan of\r\nboiling water, taking care there is sufficient to cover the bones. Boil\r\nthem for 2 hours, remove the cloth and paste, and serve them upright on\r\na napkin with dry toast. Many persons clear the marrow from the bones\r\nafter they are cooked, spread it over a slice of toast and add a\r\nseasoning of pepper; when served in this manner, it must be very\r\nexpeditiously sent to table, as it so soon gets cold.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Marrow-bones may be baked after preparing them as in the\r\npreceding recipe; they should be laid in a deep dish, and baked for 2\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARROW-BONES.]\r\n\r\n    MARROW-BONES.--Bones are formed of a dense cellular tissue of\r\n    membranous matter, made stiff and rigid by insoluble earthy\r\n    salts; of which, phosphate of lime is the most abundant. In a\r\n    large bone, the insoluble matter is generally deposited in such\r\n    a manner as to leave a cavity, into which a fatty substance,\r\n    distinguished by the name of marrow, is thrown. Hollow\r\n    cylindrical bones possess the qualities of strength and\r\n    lightness in a remarkable degree. If bones were entirely solid,\r\n    they would be unnecessarily heavy; and if their materials were\r\n    brought into smaller compass, they would be weaker, because the\r\n    strength of a bone is in proportion to the distance at which its\r\n    fibres are from the centre. Some animals, it must, however, be\r\n    observed, have no cavities in the centre of their bones; such as\r\n    the whale tribe, skate, and turtles.\r\n\r\nMINCED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n636. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of butter, 1 small onion, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\ngravy left from the meat, 1 tablespoonful of strong ale, 1/2 a\r\nteaspoonful of flour, salt and pepper to taste, a few slices of lean\r\nroast beef.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put into a stewpan the butter with an onion chopped fine; add\r\nthe gravy, ale, and 1/2 a teaspoonful of flour to thicken; season with\r\npepper and salt, and stir these ingredients over the fire until the\r\nonion is a rich brown. Cut, but do not chop the meat _very fine_, add it\r\nto the gravy, stir till quite hot, and serve. Garnish with sippets of\r\ntoasted bread. Be careful in not allowing the gravy to boil after the\r\nmeat is added, as it would render it hard and tough.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 3d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIROTON OF BEEF.\r\n\r\n637. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of cold roast beef, 3 oz. of butter,\r\nsalt and pepper to taste, 3 onions, 1/2 pint of gravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice the onions and put them into a frying-pan with the cold\r\nbeef and butter; place it over the fire, and keep turning and stirring\r\nthe ingredients to prevent them burning. When of a pale brown, add the\r\ngravy and seasoning; let it simmer for a few minutes, and serve very\r\nhot. This dish is excellent and economical.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes. _Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED OX-CHEEK.\r\n\r\n638. INGREDIENTS.--1 cheek, salt and water, 4 or 5 onions, butter and\r\nflour, 6 cloves, 3 turnips, 2 carrots, 1 bay-leaf, 1 head of celery, 1\r\nbunch of savoury herbs, cayenne, black pepper and salt to taste, 1 oz.\r\nof butter, 2 dessertspoonfuls of flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of Chili\r\nvinegar, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, 2 tablespoonfuls of port\r\nwine, 2 tablespoonfuls of Harvey's sauce.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the cheek boned, and prepare it the day before it is to be\r\neaten, by cleaning and putting it to soak all night in salt and water.\r\nThe next day, wipe it dry and clean, and put it into a stewpan. Just\r\ncover it with water, skim well when it boils, and let it gently simmer\r\ntill the meat is quite tender. Slice and fry 3 onions in a little butter\r\nand flour, and put them into the gravy; add 2 whole onions, each stuck\r\nwith 3 cloves, 3 turnips quartered, 2 carrots sliced, a bay-leaf, 1 head\r\nof celery, a bunch of herbs, and seasoning to taste of cayenne, black\r\npepper, and salt. Let these stew till perfectly tender; then take out\r\nthe cheek, divide into pieces fit to help at table, skim and strain the\r\ngravy, and thicken 1-1/2 pint of it with butter and flour in the above\r\nproportions. Add the vinegar, ketchup, and port wine; put in the pieces\r\nof cheek; let the whole boil up, and serve quite hot. Send it to table\r\nin a ragout-dish. If the colour of the gravy should not be very good,\r\nadd a tablespoonful of the browning, No. 108.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 hours. _Average cost_, 3d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED OX-FEET, or COW-HEEL.\r\n\r\n639. INGREDIENTS.--Ox-feet, the yolk of 1 egg, bread crumbs, parsley,\r\nsalt and cayenne to taste, boiling butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash, scald, and thoroughly clean the feet, and cut them into\r\npieces about 2 inches long; have ready some fine bread crumbs mixed with\r\na little minced parsley, cayenne, and salt; dip the pieces of heel into\r\nthe yolk of egg, sprinkle them with the bread crumbs, and fry them until\r\nof a nice brown in boiling butter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.-1 hour. _Average cost_, 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\nNote.--Ox-feet may be dressed in various ways, stowed in gravy or\r\nplainly boiled and served with melted butter. When plainly boiled, the\r\nliquor will answer for making sweet or relishing jellies, and also to\r\ngive richness to soups or gravies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED OX-TAILS.\r\n\r\n640. INGREDIENTS.--2 ox-tails, 1 onion, 3 cloves, 1 blade of mace, 1\r\nteaspoonful of whole black pepper, 1 teaspoonful of allspice, 1/2 a\r\nteaspoonful of salt, a small bunch of savoury herbs, thickening of\r\nbutter and flour, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nmushroom ketchup.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Divide the tails at the joints, wash, and put them into a\r\nstewpan with sufficient water to cover them, and set them on the fire;\r\nwhen the water boils, remove the scum, and add the onion cut into rings,\r\nthe spice, seasoning, and herbs. Cover the stewpan closely, and let the\r\ntails simmer very gently until tender, which will be in about 2-1/2\r\nhours. Take them out, make a thickening of butter and flour, add it to\r\nthe gravy, and let it boil for 1/4 hour. Strain it through a sieve into\r\na saucepan, put back the tails, add the lemon-juice and ketchup; let the\r\nwhole just boil up, and serve. Garnish with croûtons or sippets of\r\ntoasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 hours to stew the tails.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d. to 1s. 6d., according to the season.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n    THE TAILS OF ANIMALS.--In the class Mammalia, the vertebral\r\n    column or backbone presents only slight modifications, and\r\n    everywhere shows the same characteristics as in man, who stands\r\n    at the head of this division of the animal kingdom. The length\r\n    of this column, however, varies much, and the number of\r\n    vertebrae of which it is composed is far from being uniform.\r\n    These numerical differences principally depend on the unequal\r\n    development of the caudal portion, or tail-end, of the column.\r\n    Thus, the tail-forming vertebrae sometimes do not exist at\r\n    all,--amongst certain bats for example; in other instances we\r\n    reckon forty, fifty, and even upwards of sixty of these bones.\r\n    Among the greater number of mammals, the tail is of little use\r\n    for locomotion, except that it acts in many cases as does the\r\n    rudder of a ship, steadying the animal in his rapid movements,\r\n    and enabling him to turn more easily and quickly. Among some\r\n    animals, it becomes a very powerful instrument of progression.\r\n    Thus, in the kangaroos and jerboas, the tail forms, with the\r\n    hind feet, a kind of tripod from which the animal makes its\r\n    spring. With most of the American monkeys it is prehensile, and\r\n    serves the animal as a fifth hand to suspend itself from the\r\n    branches of trees; and, lastly, among the whales, it grows to an\r\n    enormous size, and becomes the principal instrument for\r\n    swimming.\r\n\r\nA PICKLE FOR TONGUES OR BEEF (Newmarket Recipe).\r\n\r\n641. INGREDIENTS.--1 gallon of soft water, 3 lbs. of coarse salt, 6 oz.\r\nof coarse brown sugar, 1/2 oz. of saltpetre.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a saucepan, and let them boil for\r\n1/2 hour, clear off the scum as it rises, and when done pour the pickle\r\ninto a pickling-pan. Let it get cold, then put in the meat, and allow it\r\nto remain in the pickle from 8 to 14 days, according to the size. It\r\nwill keep good for 6 months if well boiled once a fortnight. Tongues\r\nwill take 1 month or 6 weeks to be properly cured; and, in salting meat,\r\nbeef and tongues should always be put in separate vessels.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A moderate-sized tongue should remain in the pickle about a\r\nmonth, and be turned every day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POTTING-JAR.]\r\n\r\nPOTTED BEEF.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n642. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of lean beef, 1 tablespoonful of water, 1/4\r\nlb. of butter, a seasoning to taste of salt, cayenne, pounded mace, and\r\nblack pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure a nice piece of lean beef, as free as possible from\r\ngristle, skin, &c., and put it into a jar (if at hand, one with a lid)\r\nwith 1 tablespoonful of water. Cover it _closely_, and put the jar into\r\na saucepan of boiling water, letting the water come within 2 inches of\r\nthe top of the jar. Boil gently for 3-1/2 hours, then take the beef,\r\nchop it very small with a chopping-knife, and pound it thoroughly in a\r\nmortar. Mix with it by degrees all, or a portion, of the gravy that will\r\nhave run from it, and a little clarified butter; add the seasoning, put\r\nit in small pots for use, and cover with a little butter just warmed and\r\npoured over. If much gravy is added to it, it will keep but a short\r\ntime; on the contrary, if a large proportion of butter is used, it may\r\nbe preserved for some time.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, for this quantity, 1s. 8d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTTED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n643. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled beef, 1/4 lb. of\r\nbutter, cayenne to taste, 2 blades of pounded mace.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--As we have stated in recipe No. 608, the outside slices of\r\nboiled beef may, with a little trouble, be converted into a very nice\r\naddition to the breakfast-table. Cut up the meat into small pieces and\r\npound it well, with a little butter, in a mortar; add a seasoning of\r\ncayenne and mace, and be very particular that the latter ingredient is\r\nreduced to the finest powder. When all the ingredients are thoroughly\r\nmixed, put it into glass or earthen potting-pots, and pour on the top a\r\ncoating of clarified butter.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--If cold roast beef is used, remove all pieces of gristle and\r\ndry outside pieces, as these do not pound well.\r\n\r\n    PRESERVED MEATS.--When an organic substance, like the flesh of\r\n    animals, is heated to the boiling-point, it loses the property\r\n    of passing into a state of fermentation and decay. Fresh animal\r\n    milk, as is well known, coagulates, after having been kept for\r\n    two or three days, into a gelatinous mass; but it may be\r\n    preserved for an indefinite period, as a perfectly sweet liquid,\r\n    if it be heated daily to the boiling-point. The knowledge of\r\n    this effect of an elevated temperature has given rise to a most\r\n    important branch of industry,--namely, the preparation of\r\n    preserved meats for the use of the navy and merchant service. At\r\n    Leith, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, at Aberdeen, at\r\n    Bordeaux, at Marseilles, and in many parts of Germany,\r\n    establishments of enormous magnitude exist, in which soup,\r\n    vegetables, and viands of every description are prepared, in\r\n    such a manner that they retain their freshness for years. The\r\n    prepared aliments are inclosed in canisters of tinned iron\r\n    plate, the covers are soldered air-tight, and the canisters\r\n    exposed to the temperature of boiling water for three or four\r\n    hours. The aliments thus acquire a stability, which one may\r\n    almost say is eternal; and when a canister is opened, after the\r\n    lapse of several years, its contents are found to be unaltered\r\n    in taste, colour, and smell. We are indebted to the French\r\n    philosopher Gay-Lussac for this beautiful practical application\r\n    of the discovery that boiling checks fermentation. An exclusive\r\n    salt-meat diet is extremely injurious to the health; and, in\r\n    former times, thousands of mariners lost their lives for the\r\n    want of fresh aliments during long voyages. We are sorry to say\r\n    that the preserved meats are sometimes carelessly prepared, and,\r\n    though the statement seems incredible, sometimes adulterated.\r\n    Dr. Lankester, who has done so much to expose the frauds of\r\n    trade, that he ought to be regarded as a public benefactor, says\r\n    that he has seen things which were utterly unfit for food,\r\n    shipped as preserved meats. Surely, as he observes, there ought\r\n    to be some superintendent to examine the so-called articles of\r\n    food that are taken on board ship, so that the poor men who have\r\n    been fighting our battles abroad may run no risk of being\r\n    starved or poisoned on their way home.\r\n\r\nRIB OF BEEF BONES.\r\n\r\n(_A Pretty Dish_.)\r\n\r\n644. INGREDIENTS.--Rib of beef bones, 1 onion chopped fine, a few slices\r\nof carrot and turnip, 1/4 pint of gravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--The bones for this dish should have left on them a slight\r\ncovering of meat; saw them into pieces 3 inches long; season them with\r\npepper and salt, and put them into a stewpan with the remaining\r\ningredients. Stew gently, until the vegetables are tender, and serve on\r\na flat dish within walls of mashed potatoes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the bones, 2d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF RISSOLES (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n645. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast beef; to each pound of meat\r\nallow 3/4 lb. of bread crumbs, salt and pepper to taste, a few chopped\r\nsavoury herbs, 1/2 a teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1 or 2 eggs,\r\naccording to the quantity of meat.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mince the beef very fine, which should be rather lean, and mix\r\nwith this bread crumbs, herbs, seasoning, and lemon-peel, in the above\r\nproportion, to each pound of meat. Make all into a thick paste with 1 or\r\n2 eggs; divide into balls or cones, and fry a rich brown. Garnish the\r\ndish with fried parsley, and send with them to table some good brown\r\ngravy in a tureen. Instead of garnishing with fried parsley, gravy may\r\nbe poured in the dish, round the rissoles: in this case, it will not be\r\nnecessary to send any in a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 5 to 10 minutes, according to size.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 5d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nROLLED BEEF, to eat like Hare.\r\n\r\n646. INGREDIENTS.--About 5 lbs. of the inside of the sirloin, 2 glasses\r\nof port wine, 2 glasses of vinegar, a small quantity of forcemeat (No.\r\n417), 1 teaspoonful of pounded allspice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take the inside of a large sirloin, soak it in 1 glass of port\r\nwine and 1 glass of vinegar, mixed, and let it remain for 2 days. Make a\r\nforcemeat by recipe No. 417, lay it on the meat, and bind it up\r\nsecurely. Roast it before a nice clear fire, and baste it with 1 glass\r\neach of port wine and vinegar, with which mix a teaspoonful of pounded\r\nallspice. Serve, with a good gravy in the dish, and send red-currant\r\njelly to table with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A piece of 5 lbs. about 1-1/2 hour before a brisk fire.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 5s. 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF ROLLS (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n647. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled beef, seasoning\r\nto taste of salt, pepper, and minced herbs; puff paste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mince the beef tolerably fine with a small amount of its own\r\nfat; add a seasoning of pepper, salt, and chopped herbs; put the whole\r\ninto a roll of puff paste, and bake for 1/2 hour, or rather longer,\r\nshould the roll be very large. Beef patties may be made of cold meat, by\r\nmincing and seasoning beef as directed above, and baking in a rich puff\r\npaste in patty-tins.\r\n\r\n_Time_,--1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINIATURE ROUND OF BEEF. (_An Excellent Dish for a Small Family_.)\r\n\r\n648. INGREDIENTS.--From 5 to 10 lbs. of rib of beef, sufficient brine to\r\ncover the meat.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose a fine rib, have the bone removed, rub some salt over\r\nthe inside, and skewer the meat up into a nice round form, and bind it\r\nwith tape. Put it into sufficient brine to cover it (the brine should be\r\nmade by recipe No. 654), and let it remain for 6 days, turning the meat\r\nevery day. When required to be dressed, drain from the pickle, and put\r\nthe meat into very hot water; let it boil rapidly for a few minutes,\r\nwhen draw the pot to the side of the fire, and let it simmer very gently\r\nuntil done. Remove the skewer, and replace it by a plated or silver one.\r\nCarrots and turnips should be served with this dish, and may be boiled\r\nwith the meat.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A small round of 8 lbs., about 2 hours after the water boils;\r\none of 12 lbs., about 3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Should the joint be very small, 4 or 5 days will be sufficient\r\ntime to salt it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRISKET OF BEEF, a la Flamande.\r\n\r\n649. INGREDIENTS.--About 6 or 8 lbs. of the brisket of beef, 4 or 5\r\nslices of bacon, 2 carrots, 1 onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, salt and\r\npepper to taste, 4 cloves, 4 whole allspice, 2 blades of mace.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose that portion of the brisket which contains the gristle,\r\ntrim it, and put it into a stewpan with the slices of bacon, which\r\nshould be put under and over the meat. Add the vegetables, herbs,\r\nspices, and seasoning, and cover with a little weak stock or water;\r\nclose the stewpan as hermetically as possible, and simmer very gently\r\nfor 4 hours. Strain the liquor, reserve a portion of it for sauce, and\r\nthe remainder boil quickly over a sharp fire until reduced to a glaze,\r\nwith which glaze the meat. Garnish the dish with scooped carrots and\r\nturnips, and when liked, a little cabbage; all of which must be cooked\r\nseparately. Thicken and flavour the liquor that was saved for sauce,\r\npour it round the meat, and serve. The beef may also be garnished with\r\nglazed onions, artichoke-bottoms, &c.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 hours. _Average cost_, 7d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    FRENCH BEEF.--It has been all but universally admitted, that the\r\n    beef of France is greatly inferior in quality to that of\r\n    England, owing to inferiority of pasturage. M. Curmer, however,\r\n    one of the latest writers on the culinary art, tells us that\r\n    this is a vulgar error, and that French beef is far superior to\r\n    that of England. This is mere vaunting on the part of our\r\n    neighbours, who seem to want _la gloire_ in everything; and we\r\n    should not deign to notice it, if it had occurred in a work of\r\n    small pretensions; but M. Curmer's book professes to be a\r\n    complete exposition of the scientific principles of cookery, and\r\n    holds a high rank in the didactic literature of France. We half\r\n    suspect that M. Curmer obtained his knowledge of English beef in\r\n    the same way as did the poor Frenchman, whom the late Mr.\r\n    Mathews, the comedian, so humorously described. Mr. Lewis, in\r\n    his \"Physiology of Common Life,\" has thus revived the story of\r\n    the beef-eating son of France:--\"A Frenchman was one day blandly\r\n    remonstrating against the supercilious scorn expressed by\r\n    Englishmen for the beef of France, which he, for his part, did\r\n    not find so inferior to that of England. 'I have been two times\r\n    in England,' he remarked, but I nevère find the bif so supérieur\r\n    to ours. I find it vary conveenient that they bring it you on\r\n    leetle pieces of stick, for one penny: but I do not find the bif\r\n    supérieur.' On hearing this, the Englishman, red with\r\n    astonishment, exclaimed, 'Good heavens, sir! you have been\r\n    eating cat's meat.'\" No, M. Curmer, we are ready to acknowledge\r\n    the superiority of your cookery, but we have long since made up\r\n    our minds as to the inferiority of your raw material.\r\n\r\nBEEF OLIVES.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n650. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of rump-steak, 1 egg, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nminced savoury herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 1 pint of stock, No.\r\n105, 2 or 3 slices of bacon, 2 tablespoonfuls of any store sauce, a\r\nslight thickening of butter and flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the steaks cut rather thin, slightly beat them to make\r\nthem level, cut them into 6 or 7 pieces, brush over with egg, and\r\nsprinkle with herbs, which should be very finely minced; season with\r\npepper and salt, and roll up the pieces tightly, and fasten with a small\r\nskewer. Put the stock in a stewpan that will exactly hold them, for by\r\nbeing pressed together, they will keep their shape better; lay in the\r\nrolls of meat, cover them with the bacon, cut in thin slices, and over\r\nthat put a piece of paper. Stew them very _gently_ for full 2 hours; for\r\nthe slower they are done the better. Take them out, remove the skewers,\r\nthicken the gravy with butter and flour, and flavour with any store\r\nsauce that may be preferred. Give one boil, pour over the meat, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. per pound.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n(_Economical_.)\r\n\r\n651. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of underdone cold roast beef, bread\r\ncrumbs, 1 shalot finely minced, pepper and salt to taste, gravy made\r\nfrom the beef bones, thickening of butter and flour, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nmushroom ketchup.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut some slices of underdone roast beef about half an inch\r\nthick; sprinkle over them some bread crumbs, minced shalot, and a little\r\nof the fat and seasoning; roll them, and fasten with a small skewer.\r\nHave ready some gravy made from the beef bones; put in the pieces of\r\nmeat, and stew them till tender, which will be in about 1-1/4 hour, or\r\nrather longer. Arrange the meat in a dish, thicken and flavour the\r\ngravy, and pour it over the meat, when it is ready to serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the beef, 2d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED OX-TAIL (an Entree).\r\n\r\n652. INGREDIENTS.--2 tails, 1-1/2 pint of stock, No. 105, salt and\r\ncayenne to taste, bread crumbs, 1 egg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Joint and cut up the tails into convenient-sized pieces, and\r\nput them into a stewpan, with the stock, cayenne, and salt, and, if\r\nliked very savoury, a bunch of sweet herbs. Let them simmer gently for\r\nabout 2-1/2 hours; then take them out, drain them, and let them cool.\r\nBeat an egg upon a plate; dip in each piece of tail, and, afterwards,\r\nthrow them into a dish of bread crumbs; broil them over a clear fire,\r\nuntil of a brownish colour on both sides, and serve with a good gravy,\r\nor any sauce that may be preferred.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 2-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, from 9d. to 1s. 6d.,\r\naccording to the season.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--These may be more easily prepared by putting the tails in a\r\nbrisk oven, after they have been dipped in egg and bread-crumb; and,\r\nwhen brown, they are done. They must be boiled the same time as for\r\nbroiling.\r\n\r\n    STRANGE TAILS.--Naturalists cannot explain the uses of some of\r\n    the strange tails borne by animals. In the Egyptian and Syrian\r\n    sheep, for instance, the tail grows so large, that it is not\r\n    infrequently supported upon a sort of little cart, in order to\r\n    prevent inconvenience to the animal. Thin monstrous appendage\r\n    sometimes attains a weight of seventy, eighty, or even a hundred\r\n    pounds.\r\n\r\nTO DRESS BEEF PALATES (an Entree).\r\n\r\n653. INGREDIENTS.--4 palates, sufficient gravy to cover them (No. 438),\r\ncayenne to taste, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, 1 tablespoonful\r\nof pickled-onion liquor, thickening of butter and flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the palates, and put them into a stewpan, with sufficient\r\nwater to cover them, and let them boil until perfectly tender, or until\r\nthe upper skin may be easily peeled off. Have ready sufficient gravy\r\n(No. 438) to cover them; add a good seasoning of cayenne, and thicken\r\nwith roux, No. 625, or a little butter kneaded with flour; let it boil\r\nup, and skim. Cut the palates into square pieces, put them in the gravy,\r\nand let them simmer gently for 1/2 hour; add ketchup and onion-liquor,\r\ngive one boil, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 3 to 5 hours to boil the palates.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Palates may be dressed in various ways with sauce tournée, good\r\nonion sauce, tomato sauce, and also served in a vol-au-vent; but the\r\nabove will be found a more simple method of dressing them.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF PICKLE, which may also be used for any kind of Meat, Tongues, or\r\nHams.\r\n\r\n654. INGREDIENTS.--6 lbs. of salt, 2 lbs. of fine sugar, 3 oz. of\r\npowdered saltpetre, 3 gallons of spring water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil all the ingredients gently together, so long as any scum\r\nor impurity arises, which carefully remove; when quite cold, pour it\r\nover the meat, every part of which must be covered with the brine. This\r\nmay be used for pickling any kind of meat, and may be kept for some\r\ntime, if boiled up occasionally with an addition of the ingredients.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A ham should be kept in the pickle for a fortnight; a piece of\r\nbeef weighing 14 lbs., 12 or 15 days; a tongue, 10 days or a fortnight.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--For salting and pickling meat, it is a good plan to rub in only\r\nhalf the quantity of salt directed, and to let it remain for a day or\r\ntwo to disgorge and effectually to get rid of the blood and slime; then\r\nrub in the remainder of the salt and other ingredients, and proceed as\r\nabove. This rule may be applied to all the recipes we have given for\r\nsalting and pickling meat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PICKLE PART OF A ROUND OF BEEF FOR HANGING.\r\n\r\n655. INGREDIENTS.--For 14 lbs. of a round of beef allow 1-1/2 lb. of\r\nsalt, 1/2 oz. of powdered saltpetre; or, 1 lb. of salt, 1/2 lb. of\r\nsugar, 4 oz. of powdered saltpetre.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub in, and sprinkle either of the above mixtures on 14 lbs. of\r\nmeat. Keep it in an earthenware pan, or a deep wooden tray, and turn\r\ntwice a week during 3 weeks; then bind up the beef tightly with coarse\r\nlinen tape, and hang it in a kitchen in which a fire is constantly kept,\r\nfor 3 weeks. Pork, hams, and bacon may be cured in a similar way, but\r\nwill require double the quantity of the salting mixture; and, if not\r\nsmoke-dried, they should be taken down from hanging after 3 or 4 weeks,\r\nand afterwards kept in boxes or tubs, amongst dry oat-husks.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 or 3 weeks to remain in the brine; to be hung 3 weeks.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The meat may be boiled fresh from this pickle, instead of\r\nsmoking it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEP RAGOUT (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n656. INGREDIENTS.--About 2 lbs. of cold roast beef, 6 onions, pepper,\r\nsalt, and mixed spices to taste; 1/2 pint of boiling water, 3\r\ntablespoonfuls of gravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the beef into rather large pieces, and put them into a\r\nstewpan with the onions, which must be sliced. Season well with pepper,\r\nsalt, and mixed spices, and pour over about 1/2 pint of boiling water,\r\nand gravy in the above proportion (gravy saved from the meat answers the\r\npurpose); let the whole stew very gently for about 2 hours, and serve\r\nwith pickled walnuts, gherkins, or capers, just warmed in the gravy.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST RIBS OF BEEF.\r\n\r\n657. INGREDIENTS.--Beef, a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.---The fore-rib is considered the primest roasting piece, but the\r\nmiddle-rib is considered the most economical. Let the meat be well hung\r\n(should the weather permit), and cut off the thin ends of the bones,\r\nwhich should be salted for a few days, and then boiled. Put the meat\r\ndown to a nice clear fire, put some clean dripping into the pan, dredge\r\nthe joint with a little flour, and keep continually basting the whole\r\ntime. Sprinkle some fine salt over it (this must never be done until the\r\njoint is dished, as it draws the juices from the meat); pour the\r\ndripping from the pan, put in a little boiling: water slightly salted,\r\nand _strain_ the gravy over the meat. Garnish with tufts of scraped\r\nhorseradish, and send horseradish sauce to table with it (_see_ No.\r\n447). A Yorkshire pudding (_see_ Puddings) sometimes accompanies this\r\ndish, and, if lightly made and well cooked, will be found a very\r\nagreeable addition.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 lbs. of beef, 2-1/2 hours; 14 to 16 lbs., from 3-1/2 to 4\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8-1/2d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--A joint of 10 lbs. sufficient for 8 or 9 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    MEMORANDA IN ROASTING.--The management of the fire is a point of\r\n    primary importance in roasting. A radiant fire throughout the\r\n    operation is absolutely necessary to insure a good result. When\r\n    the article to be dressed is thin and delicate, the fire may be\r\n    small; but when the joint is large, the fire must fill the\r\n    grate. Meat must never be put down before a hollow or exhausted\r\n    fire, which may soon want recruiting; on the other hand, if the\r\n    heat of the fire becomes too fierce, the meat must be removed to\r\n    a considerable distance till it is somewhat abated. Some cooks\r\n    always fail in their roasts, though they succeed in nearly\r\n    everything else. A French writer on the culinary art says that\r\n    anybody can learn how to cook, but one must be born a roaster.\r\n    According to Liebig, beef or mutton cannot be said to be\r\n    sufficiently roasted until it has acquired, throughout the whole\r\n    mass, a temperature of 158°; but poultry may be well cooked when\r\n    the inner parts have attained a temperature of from 130° to\r\n    140°. This depends on the greater amount of blood which beef and\r\n    mutton contain, the colouring matter of blood not being\r\n    coagulable under 158°.\r\n\r\nROAST RIBS OF BEEF, Boned and Rolled (a very Convenient Joint for a\r\nSmall Family).\r\n\r\n658. INGREDIENTS.--1 or 2 ribs of beef.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose a fine rib of beef, and have it cut according to the\r\nweight you require, either wide or narrow. Bone and roll the meat round,\r\nsecure it with wooden skewers, and, if necessary, bind it round with a\r\npiece of tape. Spit the beef firmly, or, if a bottle-jack is used, put\r\nthe joint on the hook, and place it _near_ a nice clear fire. Let it\r\nremain so till the outside of the meat is set, when draw it to a\r\ndistance, and keep continually basting until the meat is done, which can\r\nbe ascertained by the steam from it drawing towards the fire. As this\r\njoint is solid, rather more than 1/4 hour must be allowed for each lb.\r\nRemove the skewers, put in a plated or silver one, and send the joint to\r\ntable with gravy in the dish, and garnish with tufts of horseradish.\r\nHorseradish sauce, No. 447, is a great improvement to roast beef.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--For 10 lbs. of the rolled ribs, 3 hours (as the joint is very\r\nsolid, we have allowed an extra 1/2 hour); for 6 lbs., 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\nAverage cost, 8-1/2d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--A joint of 10 lbs. for 6 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--When the weight exceeds 10 lbs., we would not advise the above\r\nmethod of boning and rolling; only in the case of 1 or 2 ribs, when the\r\njoint cannot stand upright in the dish, and would look awkward. The\r\nbones should be put in with a few vegetables and herbs, and made into\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n    ROAST BEEF has long been a national dish in England. In most of\r\n    our patriotic songs it is contrasted with the fricasseed frogs,\r\n    popularly supposed to be the exclusive diet of Frenchmen.\r\n\r\n      \"O the roast beef of old England,\r\n      And O the old English roast beef.\"\r\n\r\n    This national chorus is appealed to whenever a song-writer\r\n    wishes to account for the valour displayed by Englishmen at sea\r\n    or on land.\r\n\r\nROAST SIRLOIN OF BEEF.\r\n\r\n659. INGREDIENTS.--Beef, a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--As a joint cannot be well roasted without a good fire, see that\r\nit is well made up about 3/4 hour before it is required, so that when\r\nthe joint is put down, it is clear and bright. Choose a nice sirloin,\r\nthe weight of which should not exceed 16 lbs., as the outside would be\r\ntoo much done, whilst the inside would not be done enough. Spit it or\r\nhook it on to the jack firmly, dredge it slightly with flour, and place\r\nit near the fire at first, as directed in the preceding recipe. Then\r\ndraw it to a distance, and keep continually basting until the meat is\r\ndone. Sprinkle a small quantity of salt over it, empty the dripping-pan\r\nof all the dripping, pour in some boiling water slightly salted, stir it\r\nabout, and _strain_ over the meat. Garnish with tufts of horseradish,\r\nand send horseradish sauce and Yorkshire pudding to table with it. For\r\ncarving, _see_ p. 317.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A sirloin of 10 lbs., 2-1/2 hours; 14 to 16 lbs., about 4 or\r\n4-1/2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8-1/2d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--A joint of 10 lbs. for 8 or 9 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\nThe rump, round, and other pieces of beef are roasted in the same\r\nmanner, allowing for solid joints; 1/4 hour to every lb.\r\n\r\n_Note_.---The above is the usual method of roasting moat; but to have it\r\nin perfection and the juices kept in, the meat should at first be laid\r\nclose to the fire, and when the outside is set and firm, drawn away to a\r\ngood distance, and then left to roast very slowly; where economy is\r\nstudied, this plan would not answer, as the meat requires to be at the\r\nfire double the time of the ordinary way of cooking; consequently,\r\ndouble the quantity of fuel would be consumed.\r\n\r\n    ORIGIN OF THE WORD \"SIRLOIN.\"--The loin of beef is said to have\r\n    been knighted by King Charles II., at Friday Hall, Chingford.\r\n    The \"Merry Monarch\" returned to this hospitable mansion for\r\n    Epping Forest literally \"as hungry as a hunter,\" and beheld,\r\n    with delight, a huge loin of beef steaming upon the table. \"A\r\n    noble joint!\" exclaimed the king. \"By St. George, it shall have\r\n    a title!\" Then drawing his sword, he raised it above the meat,\r\n    and cried, with mock dignity, \"Loin, we dub thee knight;\r\n    henceforward be Sir Loin!\" This anecdote is doubtless\r\n    apocryphal, although the oak table upon which the joint was\r\n    supposed to have received its knighthood, might have been seen\r\n    by any one who visited Friday-Hill House, a few years ago. It\r\n    is, perhaps, a pity to spoil so noble a story; but the interests\r\n    of truth demand that we declare that _sirloin_ is probably a\r\n    corruption of _surloin_, which signifies the upper part of a\r\n    loin, the prefix _sur_ being equivalent to _over_ or _above_. In\r\n    French we find this joint called _surlonge_, which so closely\r\n    resembles our _sirloin_, that we may safely refer the two words\r\n    to a common origin.\r\n\r\nTO SALT BEEF.\r\n\r\n660. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 round of beef, 4 oz. of sugar, 1 oz. of powdered\r\nsaltpetre, 2 oz. of black pepper, 1/4 lb. of bay-salt, 1/2 lb. of common\r\nsalt. _Mode_.--Rub the meat well with salt, and let it remain for a day,\r\nto disgorge and clear it from slime. The next day, rub it well with the\r\nabove ingredients on every side, and let it remain in the pickle for\r\nabout a fortnight, turning it every day. It may be boiled fresh from the\r\npickle, or smoked.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 round of beef to remain in pickle about a fortnight.\r\n_Average cost_, 7d. per lb. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The aitch-bone, flank, or brisket may be salted and pickled by\r\nany of the recipes we have given for salting beef, allowing less time\r\nfor small joints to remain in the pickle; for instance, a joint of 8 or\r\n9 lbs. will be sufficiently salt in about a week.\r\n\r\nTHE DUTCH WAY TO SALT BEEF.\r\n\r\n661. INGREDIENTS.--10 lbs. of lean beef, 1 lb. of treacle, 1 oz. of\r\nsaltpetre, 1 lb. of common salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the beef well with the treacle, and let it remain for 3\r\ndays, turning and rubbing it often; then wipe it, pound the salt and\r\nsaltpetre very fine, rub these well in, and turn it every day for 10\r\ndays. Roll it up tightly in a coarse cloth, and press it under a large\r\nweight; have it smoked, and turn it upside down every day. Boil it, and,\r\non taking it out of the pot, put a heavy weight on it to press it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--17 days.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF SAUSAGES.\r\n\r\n662. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of suet allow 2 lbs. of lean beef;\r\nseasoning to taste of salt, pepper, and mixed spices.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clear the suet from skin, and chop that and the beef as finely\r\nas possible; season with pepper, salt, and spices, and mix the whole\r\nwell together. Make it into flat cakes, and fry of a nice brown. Many\r\npersons pound the meat in a mortar after it is chopped ( but this is not\r\nnecessary when the meat is minced finely.)\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes. _Average cost_, for this quantity, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF-STEAK, Rolled, Roasted, and Stuffed.\r\n\r\n663. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of rump-steak, forcemeat No. 417, pepper and\r\nsalt to taste, clarified butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the steaks cut rather thick from a well-hung rump of beef,\r\nand sprinkle over them a seasoning of pepper and salt. Make a forcemeat\r\nby recipe No. 417; spread it over _half_ of the steak; roll it up, bind\r\nand skewer it firmly, that the forcemeat may not escape, and roast it\r\nbefore a nice clear fire for about 1-1/2 hour, or rather longer, should\r\nthe roll be very large and thick. Keep it constantly basted with butter,\r\nand serve with brown gravy, some of which must be poured round the\r\nsteak, and the remainder sent to table in a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but best in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLICED AND BROILED BEEF--a Pretty Dish (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n664. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of cold roast beef, 4 or 5 potatoes, a\r\nthin batter, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare the potatoes as you would peel an apple; fry the parings\r\nin a thin batter seasoned with salt and pepper, until they are of a\r\nlight brown colour, and place them on a dish over some slices of beef,\r\nwhich should be nicely seasoned and broiled.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes to broil the meat.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPICED BEEF (to Serve Cold).\r\n\r\n665. INGREDIENTS.--14 lbs. of the thick flank or rump of beef, 1/2 lb.\r\nof coarse sugar, 1 oz. of saltpetre, 1/4 lb. of pounded allspice, 1 lb.\r\nof common salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the sugar well into the beef, and let it lay for 12 hours;\r\nthen rub the saltpetre and allspice, both of which should be pounded,\r\nover the meat, and let it remain for another 12 hours; then rub in the\r\nsalt. Turn daily in the liquor for a fortnight, soak it for a few hours\r\nin water, dry with a cloth, cover with a coarse paste, put a little\r\nwater at the bottom of the pan, and bake in a moderate oven for 4 hours.\r\nIf it is not covered with a paste, be careful to put the beef into a\r\ndeep vessel, and cover with a plate, or it will be too crisp. During the\r\ntime the meat is in the oven it should be turned once or twice.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 hours. _Average cost_, 7d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    BAKING MEAT.--Baking exerts some unexplained influence on meat,\r\n    rendering it less savoury and less agreeable than meat which has\r\n    been roasted. \"Those who have travelled in Germany and France,\"\r\n    writes Mr. Lewis, one of our most popular scientific authors,\r\n    \"must have repeatedly marvelled at the singular uniformity in\r\n    the flavour, or want of flavour, of the various 'roasts' served\r\n    up at the _table-d'hôte_.\" The general explanation is, that the\r\n    German and French meat is greatly inferior in quality to that of\r\n    England and Holland, owing to the inferiority of pasturage; and\r\n    doubtless this is one cause, but it is not the chief cause. The\r\n    meat is inferior, but the cooking is mainly at fault. The meat\r\n    is scarcely ever _roasted_, because there is no coal, and\r\n    firewood is expensive. The meat is therefore _baked;_ and the\r\n    consequence of this baking is, that no meat is eatable or eaten,\r\n    with its own gravy, but is always accompanied by some sauce more\r\n    or less piquant. The Germans generally believe that in England\r\n    we eat our beef and mutton almost raw; they shudder at our\r\n    gravy, as if it were so much blood.\r\n\r\nSTEWED BEEF or RUMP STEAK (an Entree).\r\n\r\n666. INGREDIENTS.--About 2 lbs. of beef or rump steak, 3 onions, 2\r\nturnips, 3 carrots, 2 or 3 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint of water, 1\r\nteaspoonful of salt, 1/2 do. of pepper, 1 tablespoonful of ketchup, 1\r\ntablespoonful of flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the steaks cut tolerably thick and rather lean; divide\r\nthem into convenient-sized pieces, and fry them in the butter a nice\r\nbrown on both sides. Cleanse and pare the vegetables, cut the onions and\r\ncarrots into thin slices, and the turnips into dice, and fry these in\r\nthe same fat that the steaks were done in. Put all into a saucepan, add\r\n1/2 pint of water, or rather more should it be necessary, and simmer\r\nvery gently for 2-1/2 or 3 hours; when nearly done, skim well, add salt,\r\npepper, and ketchup in the above proportions, and thicken with a\r\ntablespoonful of flour mixed with 2 of cold water. Let it boil up for a\r\nminute or two after the thickening is added, and serve. When a\r\nvegetable-scoop is at hand, use it to cut the vegetables in fanciful\r\nshapes, and tomato, Harvey's sauce, or walnut-liquor may be used to\r\nflavour the gravy. It is less rich if stewed the previous day, so that\r\nthe fat may be taken off when cold; when wanted for table, it will\r\nmerely require warming through.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours. Average cost, 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED BEEF AND CELERY SAUCE (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n667. INGREDIENTS.--3 roots of celery, 1 pint of gravy, No. 436, 2 onions\r\nsliced, 2 lbs. of cold roast or boiled beef.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the celery into 2-inch pieces, put them in a stew-pan, with\r\nthe gravy and onions, simmer gently until the celery is tender, when add\r\nthe beef cut into rather thick pieces; stew gently for 10 minutes, and\r\nserve with fried potatoes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 20 to 25 minutes to stew the celery.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to January.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED BEEF WITH OYSTERS (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n668. INGREDIENTS.--A few thick steaks of cold ribs or sirloin of beef, 2\r\noz. of butter, 1 onion sliced, pepper and salt to taste, 1/2 glass of\r\nport wine, a little flour to thicken, 1 or 2 dozen oysters, rather more\r\nthan 1/2 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the steaks rather thick, from cold sirloin or ribs of beef;\r\nbrown them lightly in a stewpan, with the butter and a little water; add\r\n1/2 pint of water, the onion, pepper, and salt, and cover the stewpan\r\nclosely, and let it simmer very gently for 1/2 hour; then mix about a\r\nteaspoonful of flour smoothly with a little of the liquor; add the port\r\nwine and oysters, their liquor having been previously strained and put\r\ninto the stewpan; stir till the oysters plump, and serve. It should not\r\nboil after the oysters are added, or they will harden.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 1s. 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED BRISKET OF BEEF.\r\n\r\n669. INGREDIENTS.--7 lbs. of a brisket of beef, vinegar and salt, 6\r\ncarrots, 6 turnips, 6 small onions, 1 blade of pounded mace, 2 whole\r\nallspice pounded, thickening of butter and flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\nketchup; stock, or water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--About an hour before dressing it, rub the meat over with\r\nvinegar and salt; put it into a stewpan, with sufficient stock to cover\r\nit (when this is not at hand, water may be substituted for it), and be\r\nparticular that the stewpan is not much larger than the meat. Skim well,\r\nand when it has simmered very gently for 1 hour, put in the vegetables,\r\nand continue simmering till the meat is perfectly tender. Draw out the\r\nbones, dish the meat, and garnish either with tufts of cauliflower or\r\nbraised cabbage cut in quarters. Thicken as much gravy as required, with\r\na little butter and flour; add spices and ketchup in the above\r\nproportion, give one boil, pour some of it over the meat, and the\r\nremainder send in a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--rather more than 3 hours. _Average cost_, 7d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The remainder of the liquor in which the beef was boiled may be\r\nserved as a soup, or it may be sent to table with the meat in a tureen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED RUMP OF BEEF.\r\n\r\n670. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 rump of beef, sufficient stock to cover it (No.\r\n105), 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 2 tablespoonfuls of ketchup, 1 large\r\nbunch of savoury herbs, 2 onions, 12 cloves, pepper and salt to taste,\r\nthickening of butter and flour, 1 glass of port wine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut out the bone, sprinkle the meat with a little cayenne (this\r\nmust be sparingly used), and bind and tie it firmly up with tape; put it\r\ninto a stewpan with sufficient stock to cover it, and add vinegar,\r\nketchup, herbs, onions, cloves, and seasoning in the above proportion,\r\nand simmer very gently for 4 or 5 hours, or until the meat is perfectly\r\ntender, which may be ascertained by piercing it with a thin skewer. When\r\ndone, remove the tape, lay it into a deep dish, which keep hot; strain\r\nand skim the gravy, thicken it with butter and flour, add a glass of\r\nport wine and any flavouring to make the gravy rich and palatable; let\r\nit boil up, pour over the meat, and serve. This dish may be very much\r\nenriched by garnishing with forcemeat balls, or filling up the space\r\nwhence the bone is taken with a good forcemeat; sliced carrots, turnips,\r\nand onions boiled with the meat, are also a great improvement, and,\r\nwhere expense is not objected to, it may be glazed. This, however, is\r\nnot necessary where a good gravy is poured round and over the meat.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 rump stewed gently from 4 to 5 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. per lb. _Sufficient_ for 8 or 10 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A stock or gravy in which to boil the meat, may be made of the\r\nbone and trimmings, by boiling them with water, and adding carrots,\r\nonions, turnips, and a bunch of sweet herbs. To make this dish richer\r\nand more savoury, half-roast the rump, and afterwards stew it in strong\r\nstock and a little Madeira. This is an expensive method, and is not,\r\nafter all, much better than a plainer-dressed joint.\r\n\r\n    THE BARON OF BEEF.--This noble joint, which consisted of two\r\n    sirloins not cut asunder, was a favourite dish of our ancestors.\r\n    It is rarely seen nowadays; indeed, it seems out of place on a\r\n    modern table, as it requires the grim boar's head and Christmas\r\n    pie as supporters. Sir Walter Scott has described a feast at\r\n    which the baron of beef would have appeared to great advantage.\r\n    We will quote a few lines to remind us of those days when\r\n    \"England was merry England,\" and when hospitality was thought to\r\n    be the highest virtue.\r\n\r\n      \"The fire, with well-dried logs supplied,\r\n      Went roaring up the chimney wide;\r\n      The huge hall-table's oaken face,\r\n      Scrubb'd till it shone, the day to grace,\r\n      Bore then, upon its massive board,\r\n      No mark to part the squire and lord.\r\n      Then was brought in the lusty brawn,\r\n      By old blue-coated serving-man;\r\n      Then the grim boar's head frown'd on high,\r\n      Crested with bays and rosemary.\r\n      Well can the green-garb'd ranger tell\r\n      How, when, and where the monster fell;\r\n      What dogs before his death he tore,\r\n      And all the baiting of the boar;\r\n      While round the merry wassel bowl,\r\n      Garnish'd with ribbons, blithe did trowl.\r\n      There the huge sirloin reek'd; hard by\r\n      Plum-porridge stood, and Christmas pie;\r\n      Nor fail'd old Scotland to produce,\r\n      At such high tide, her savoury goose.\"\r\n\r\n    When a lord's son came of age, in the olden time, the baron of\r\n    beef was too small a joint, by many degrees, to satisfy the\r\n    retainers who would flock to the hall; a whole ox was therefore\r\n    generally roasted over a fire built up of huge logs. We may here\r\n    mention, that an ox was roasted entire on the frozen Thames, in\r\n    the early part of the present century.\r\n\r\nSTEWED SHIN OF BEEF.\r\n\r\n671. INGREDIENTS.--A shin of beef, 1 head of celery, 1 onion, a faggot\r\nof savoury herbs, 1/2 teaspoonful of allspice, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole\r\nblack pepper, 4 carrots, 12 button onions, 2 turnips, thickening of\r\nbutter and flour, 3 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, 2 tablespoonfuls\r\nof port wine; pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the bone sawn into 4 or 5 pieces, cover with hot water,\r\nbring it to a boil, and remove any scum that may rise to the surface.\r\nPut in the celery, onion, herbs, spice, and seasoning, and simmer very\r\ngently until the meat is tender. Peel the vegetables, cut them into any\r\nshape fancy may dictate, and boil them with the onions until tender;\r\nlift out the beef, put it on a dish, which keep hot, and thicken with\r\nbutter and flour as much of the liquor as will be wanted for gravy; keep\r\nstirring till it boils, then strain and skim. Put the gravy back in the\r\nstewpan, add the seasoning, port wine, and ketchup, give one boil, and\r\npour it over the beef; garnish with the boiled carrots, turnips, and\r\nonions.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--The meat to be stewed about 4 hours. _Average cost_, 4d. per\r\nlb. with bone.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAD-IN-THE-HOLE (a Homely but Savoury Dish).\r\n\r\n672. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of rump-steak, 1 sheep's kidney, pepper and\r\nsalt to taste. For the batter, 3 eggs, 1 pint of milk, 4 tablespoonfuls\r\nof flour, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the steak and kidney into convenient-sized pieces, and\r\nput them into a pie-dish, with a good seasoning of salt and pepper; mix\r\nthe flour with a small quantity of milk at first, to prevent its being\r\nlumpy; add the remainder, and the 3 eggs, which should be well beaten;\r\nput in the salt, stir the batter for about 5 minutes, and pour it over\r\nthe steak. Place it in a tolerably brisk oven immediately, and bake for\r\n1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The remains of cold beef, rather underdone, may be substituted\r\nfor the steak, and, when liked, the smallest possible quantity of minced\r\nonion or shalot may be added.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED TONGUE.\r\n\r\n673. INGREDIENTS.--1 tongue, a bunch of savoury herbs, water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--In choosing a tongue, ascertain how long it has been dried or\r\npickled, and select one with a smooth skin, which denotes its being\r\nyoung and tender. If a dried one, and rather hard, soak it at least for\r\n12 hours previous to cooking it; if, however, it is fresh from the\r\npickle, 2 or 3 hours will be sufficient for it to remain in sock. Put\r\nthe tongue in a stewpan with plenty of cold water and a bunch of savoury\r\nherbs; let it gradually come to a boil, skim well and simmer very gently\r\nuntil tender. Peel off the skin, garnish with tufts of cauliflowers or\r\nBrussels sprouts, and serve. Boiled tongue is frequently sent to table\r\nwith boiled poultry, instead of ham, and is, by many persons, preferred.\r\nIf to serve cold, peel it, fasten it down to a piece of board by\r\nsticking a fork through the root, and another through the top, to\r\nstraighten it. When cold, glaze it, and put a paper ruche round the\r\nroot, and garnish with tufts of parsley.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A large smoked tongue, 4 to 4-1/2 hours; a small one, 2-1/2 to\r\n3 hours. A large unsmoked tongue, 3 to 3-1/2 hours; a small one, 2 to\r\n2-1/2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for a moderate sized tongue, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CURE TONGUES.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n674. INGREDIENTS.--For a tongue of 7 lbs., 1 oz. of saltpetre, 1/2 oz.\r\nof black pepper, 4 oz. of sugar, 3 oz. of juniper berries, 6 oz. of\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the above ingredients well into the tongue, and let it\r\nremain in the pickle for 10 days or a fortnight; then drain it, tie it\r\nup in brown paper, and have it smoked for about 20 days over a wood\r\nfire; or it may be boiled out of this pickle.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 10 to 14 days to remain in the pickle; to be smoked 24\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for a medium-sized uncured tongue, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--If not wanted immediately, the tongue will keep 3 or 4 weeks\r\nwithout being too salt; then it must not be rubbed, but only turned in\r\nthe pickle.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n675. INGREDIENTS.--9 lbs. of salt, 8 oz. of sugar, 9 oz. of powdered\r\nsaltpetre.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the above ingredients well into the tongues, and keep them\r\nin this curing mixture for 2 months, turning them every day. Drain them\r\nfrom the pickle, cover with brown paper, and have them smoked for about\r\n3 weeks.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--The tongues to remain in pickle 2 months; to be smoked 3 weeks.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--The above quantity of brine sufficient for 12 tongues, of\r\n5 lbs. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEEF TONGUE.]\r\n\r\n    THE TONGUES OF ANIMALS.--The tongue, whether in the ox or in\r\n    man, is the seat of the sense of taste. This sense warns the\r\n    animal against swallowing deleterious substances. Dr. Carpenter\r\n    says, that, among the lower animals, the instinctive perceptions\r\n    connected with this sense, are much more remarkable than our\r\n    own; thus, an omnivorous monkey will seldom touch fruits of a\r\n    poisonous character, although their taste may be agreeable.\r\n    However this may be, man's instinct has decided that ox-tongue\r\n    is better than horse-tongue; nevertheless, the latter is\r\n    frequently substituted by dishonest dealers for the former. The\r\n    horse's tongue may be readily distinguished by a spoon-like\r\n    expansion at its end.\r\n\r\nTO PICKLE AND DRESS A TONGUE TO EAT COLD.\r\n\r\n676. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of salt, 2 oz. of bay-salt, 1 oz. of saltpetre,\r\n3 oz. of coarse sugar; cloves, mace, and allspice to taste; butter,\r\ncommon crust of flour and water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Lay the tongue for a fortnight in the above pickle, turn it\r\nevery day, and be particular that the spices are well pounded; put it\r\ninto a small pan just large enough to hold it, place some pieces of\r\nbutter on it, and cover with a common crust. Bake in a slow oven until\r\nso tender that a straw would penetrate it; take off the skin, fasten it\r\ndown to a piece of board by running a fork through the root and another\r\nthrough the tip, at the same time straightening it and putting it into\r\nshape. When cold, glaze it, put a paper ruche round the root, which is\r\ngenerally very unsightly, and garnish with tufts of parsley.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 3 or 4 hours in a slow oven, according to size.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for a medium-sized uncured tongue, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DRESS TRIPE.\r\n\r\n677. INGREDIENTS.--Tripe, onion sauce, No. 484, milk and water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Ascertain that the tripe is quite fresh, and have it cleaned\r\nand dressed. Cut away the coarsest fat, and boil it in equal proportions\r\nof milk and water for 3/4 hour. Should the tripe be entirely undressed,\r\nmore than double that time should be allowed for it. Have ready some\r\nonion sauce made by recipe No. 4S4, dish the tripe, smother it with the\r\nsauce, and the remainder send to table in a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour: for undressed tripe, from 2-1/2 to 3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 7d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Tripe may be dressed in a variety of ways: it may be cut in\r\npieces and fried in batter, stewed in gravy with mushrooms, or cut into\r\ncollops, sprinkled with minced onion and savoury herbs, and fried a nice\r\nbrown in clarified butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF CARVING.\r\n\r\nAITCHBONE OF BEEF.\r\n\r\nA boiled aitch-bone of beef is not a difficult joint to carve, as will\r\nbe seen on reference to the accompanying engraving. By following with\r\nthe knife the direction of the line from 1 to 2, nice slices will be\r\neasily cut. It may be necessary, as in a round of beef, to cut a thick\r\nslice off the outside before commencing to serve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBRISKET OF BEEF.\r\n\r\nThere is but little description necessary to add, to show the carving of\r\na boiled brisket of beef, beyond the engraving here inserted. The only\r\npoint to be observed is, that the joint should be cut evenly and firmly\r\nquite across the bones, so that, on its reappearance at table, it should\r\nnot have a jagged and untidy look.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nRIBS OF BEEF.\r\n\r\nThis dish resembles the sirloin, except that it has no fillet or\r\nundercut. As explained in the recipes, the end piece is often cut off,\r\nsalted and boiled. The mode of carving is similar to that of the\r\nsirloin, viz., in the direction of the dotted line from 1 to 2. This\r\njoint will be the more easily cut if the plan be pursued which is\r\nsuggested in carving the sirloin; namely, the inserting of the knife\r\nimmediately between the bone and the moat, before commencing to cut it\r\ninto slices. All joints of roast beef should be cut in even and thin\r\nslices. Horseradish, finely scraped, may be served as a garnish; but\r\nhorseradish sauce is preferable for eating with the beef.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSIRLOIN OF BEEF.\r\n\r\nThis dish is served differently at various tables, some preferring it to\r\ncome to table with the fillet, or, as it is usually called, the\r\nundercut, uppermost. The reverse way, as shown in the cut, is that most\r\nusually adopted. Still the undercut is best eaten when hot;\r\nconsequently, the carver himself may raise the joint, and cut some\r\nslices from the under side, in the direction of from 1 to 2, as the\r\nfillet is very much preferred by some eaters. The upper part of the\r\nsirloin should be cut in the direction of the line from 5 to 6, and care\r\nshould be taken to carve it evenly and in thin slices. It will be found\r\na great assistance, in carving this joint well, if the knife be first\r\ninserted just above the bone at the bottom, and run sharply along\r\nbetween the bone and meat, and also to divide the meat from the bone in\r\nthe same way at the side of the joint. The slices will then come away\r\nmore readily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSome carvers cut the upper side of the sirloin across, as shown by the\r\nline from 3 to 4; but this is a wasteful plan, and one not to be\r\nrecommended. With the sirloin, very finely-scraped horseradish is\r\nusually served, and a little given, when liked, to each guest.\r\nHorseradish sauce is preferable, however, for serving on the plate,\r\nalthough the scraped horseradish may still be used as a garnish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA ROUND OF BEEF.\r\n\r\nA round of beef is not so easily carved as many other joints of beef,\r\nand to manage it properly, a thin-bladed and very sharp knife is\r\nnecessary. Off the outside of the joint, at its top, a thick slice\r\nshould first be cut, so as to leave the surface smooth; then thin and\r\neven slices should be cleverly carved in the direction of the line 1 to\r\n2; and with each slice of the lean a delicate morsel of the fat should\r\nbe served.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBEEF TONGUE.\r\n\r\nPassing the knife down in the direction of from 1 to 2, a not too thin\r\nslice should be helped; and the carving of a tongue may be continued in\r\nthis way until the best portions of the upper side are served. The fat\r\nwhich lies about the root of the tongue can be served by turning the\r\ntongue, and cutting in the direction of from 3 to 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE SHEEP AND LAMB.\r\n\r\n678. OF ALL WILD or DOMESTICATED ANIMALS, the sheep is, without\r\nexception, the most useful to man as a food, and the most necessary to\r\nhis health and comfort; for it not only supplies him with the lightest\r\nand most nutritious of meats, but, in the absence of the cow, its udder\r\nyields him milk, cream, and a sound though inferior cheese; while from\r\nits fat he obtains light, and from its fleece broadcloth, kerseymere,\r\nblankets, gloves, and hose. Its bones when burnt make an animal\r\ncharcoal--ivory black--to polish his boots, and when powdered, a manure\r\nfor the cultivation of his wheat; the skin, either split or whole, is\r\nmade into a mat for his carriage, a housing for his horse, or a lining\r\nfor his hat, and many other useful purposes besides, being extensively\r\nemployed in the manufacture of parchment; and finally, when oppressed by\r\ncare and sorrow, the harmonious strains that carry such soothing\r\ncontentment to the heart, are elicited from the musical strings,\r\nprepared almost exclusively from the intestines of the sheep.\r\n\r\n679. THIS VALUABLE ANIMAL, of which England is estimated to maintain an\r\naverage stock of 32,000,000, belongs to the class already indicated\r\nunder the ox,--the _Mammalia_; to the order of _Rumenantia_, or\r\ncud-chewing animal; to the tribe of _Capridae_, or horned quadrupeds;\r\nand the genus _Ovis_, or the \"sheep.\" The sheep may be either with or\r\nwithout horns; when present, however, they have always this peculiarity,\r\nthat they spring from a triangular base, are spiral in form, and\r\nlateral, at the side of the head, in situation. The fleece of the sheep\r\nis of two sorts, either short and harsh, or soft and woolly; the wool\r\nalways preponderating in an exact ratio to the care, attention, and\r\namount of domestication bestowed on the animal. The generic\r\npeculiarities of the sheep are the triangular and spiral form of the\r\nhorns, always larger in the male when present, but absent in the most\r\ncultivated species; having sinuses at the base of all the toes of the\r\nfour feet, with two rudimentary hoofs on the fore legs, two inguinal\r\nteats to the udder, with a short tail in the wild breed, but of varying\r\nlength in the domesticated; have no incisor teeth in the upper jaw, but\r\nin their place a hard elastic cushion along the margin of the gum, on\r\nwhich the animal nips and breaks the herbage on which it feeds; in the\r\nlower jaw there are eight incisor teeth and six molars on each side of\r\nboth jaws, making in all 32 teeth. The fleece consists of two coats, one\r\nto keep the animal warm, the other to carry off the water without\r\nwetting the skin. The first is of wool, the weight and fineness of which\r\ndepend on the quality of the pasture and the care bestowed on the flock;\r\nthe other of hair, that pierces the wool and overlaps it, and is in\r\nexcess in exact proportion to the badness of the keep and inattention\r\nwith which the animal is treated.\r\n\r\n680. THE GREAT OBJECT OF THE GRAZIER is to procure an animal that will\r\nyield the greatest pecuniary return in the shortest time; or, in other\r\nwords, soonest convert grass and turnips into good mutton and fine\r\nfleece. All sheep will not do this alike; some, like men, are so\r\nrestless and irritable, that no system of feeding, however good, will\r\ndevelop their frames or make them fat. The system adopted by the breeder\r\nto obtain a valuable animal for the butcher, is to enlarge the capacity\r\nand functions of the digestive organs, and reduce those of the head and\r\nchest, or the mental and respiratory organs. In the first place, the\r\nmind should be tranquillized, and those spaces that can never produce\r\nanimal fibre curtailed, and greater room afforded, as in the abdomen,\r\nfor those that can. And as nothing militates against the fattening\r\nprocess so much as restlessness, the chief wish of the grazier is to\r\nfind a dull, indolent sheep, one who, instead of frisking himself,\r\nleaping his wattles, or even condescending to notice the butting gambols\r\nof his silly companions, silently fills his paunch with pasture, and\r\nthen seeking a shady nook, indolently and luxuriously chows his cud with\r\nclosed eyes and blissful satisfaction, only rising when his delicious\r\nrepast is ended, to proceed silently and without emotion to repeat the\r\npleasing process of laying in more provender, and then returning to his\r\ndreamy siesta to renew the delightful task of rumination. Such animals\r\nare said to have a _lymphatic_ temperament, and are of so kindly a\r\nnature, that on good pasturage they may be said to grow daily. The\r\nLeicestershire breed is the best example of this lymphatic and contented\r\nanimal, and the active Orkney, who is half goat in his habits, of the\r\nrestless and unprofitable. The rich pasture of our midland counties\r\nwould take years in making the wiry Orkney fat and profitable, while one\r\nday's fatigue in climbing rocks after a coarse and scanty herbage would\r\nprobably cause the actual death of the pampered and short-winded\r\nLeicester.\r\n\r\n681. THE MORE REMOVED FROM THE NATURE of the animal is the food on which\r\nit lives, the more difficult is the process of assimilation, and the\r\nmore complex the chain of digestive organs; for it must be evident to\r\nall, that the same apparatus that converts _flesh_ into _flesh_, is\r\nhardly calculated to transmute _grass_ into flesh. As the process of\r\ndigestion in carnivorous animals is extremely simple, these organs are\r\nfound to be remarkably short, seldom exceeding the length of the\r\nanimal's body; while, where digestion is more difficult, from the\r\nunassimilating nature of the aliment, as in the ruminant order, the\r\nalimentary canal, as is the case with the sheep, is _twenty-seven times\r\nthe length of the body._ The digestive organ in all ruminant animals\r\nconsists of _four stomachs_, or, rather, a capacious pouch, divided by\r\ndoorways and valves into four compartments, called, in their order of\r\nposition, the Paunch, the Reticulum, the Omasum, and the Abomasum. When\r\nthe sheep nibbles the grass, and is ignorantly supposed to be eating, he\r\nis, in fact, only preparing the raw material of his meal, in reality\r\nonly mowing the pasture, which, as he collects, is swallowed instantly,\r\npassing into the first receptacle, the _paunch_, where it is surrounded\r\nby a quantity of warm saliva, in which the herbage undergoes a process\r\nof maceration or softening, till the animal having filled this\r\ncompartment, the contents pass through a valve into the second or\r\nsmaller bag,--the _reticulum_, where, having again filled the paunch\r\nwith a reserve, the sheep lies down and commences that singular process\r\nof chewing the cud, or, in other words, masticating the food he has\r\ncollected. By the operation of a certain set of muscles, a small\r\nquantity of this softened food from the _reticulum_, or second bag, is\r\npassed into the mouth, which it now becomes the pleasure of the sheep to\r\ngrind under his molar teeth into a soft smooth pulp, the operation being\r\nfurther assisted by a flow of saliva, answering the double purpose of\r\nincreasing the flavour of the aliment and promoting the solvency of the\r\nmass. Having completely comminuted and blended this mouthful, it is\r\nswallowed a second time; but instead of returning to the paunch or\r\nreticulum, it passes through another valve into a side cavity,--the\r\n_omasum_, where, after a maceration in more saliva for some hours, it\r\nglides by the same contrivance into the fourth pouch,--the _abomasum_,\r\nan apartment in all respects analogous to the ordinary stomach of\r\nanimals, and where the process of digestion, begun and carried on in the\r\nprevious three, is here consummated, and the nutrient principle, by\r\nmeans of the bile, eliminated from the digested aliment. Such is the\r\nprocess of digestion in sheep and oxen.\r\n\r\n682. NO OTHER ANIMAL, even of the same order, possesses in so remarkable\r\na degree the power of converting pasture into flesh as the\r\nLeicestershire sheep; the South Down and Cheviot, the two next breeds in\r\nquality, are, in consequence of the greater vivacity of the animal's\r\nnature, not equal to it in that respect, though in both the brain and\r\nchest are kept subservient to the greater capacity of the organs of\r\ndigestion. Besides the advantage of increased bulk and finer fleeces,\r\nthe breeder seeks to obtain an augmented deposit of tissue in those\r\nparts of the carcase most esteemed as food, or, what are called in the\r\ntrade \"prime joints;\" and so far has this been effected, that the\r\ncomparative weight of the hind quarters over the fore has become a test\r\nof quality in the breed, the butchers in some markets charging twopence\r\na pound more for that portion of the sheep. Indeed, so superior are the\r\nhind quarters of mutton now regarded, that very many of the West-end\r\nbutchers never deal in any other part of the sheep.\r\n\r\n683. THE DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF THE FLESH in various breeds is a\r\nwell-established fact, not alone in flavour, but also in tenderness; and\r\nthat the nature of the pasture on which the sheep is fed influences the\r\nflavour of the meat, is equally certain, and shown in the estimation in\r\nwhich those flocks are held which have grazed on the thymy heath of\r\nBamstead in Sussex. It is also a well-established truth, that the\r\n_larger_ the frame of the animal, the _coarser_ is the meat, and that\r\n_small bones_ are both guarantees for the fineness of the breed and the\r\ndelicacy of the flesh. The sex too has much to do in determining the\r\nquality of the meat; in the males, the lean is closer in fibre, deeper\r\nin colour, harder in texture, less juicy, and freer from fat, than in\r\nthe female, and is consequently tougher and more difficult of digestion;\r\nbut probably age, and the character of the pasturage on which they are\r\nreared, has, more than any other cause, an influence on the quality and\r\ntenderness of the meat.\r\n\r\n684. THE NUMEROUS VARIETIES of sheep inhabiting the different regions of\r\nthe earth have been reduced by Cuvier to three, or at most four,\r\nspecies: the _Ovis Amman_, or the Argali, the presumed parent stock of\r\nall the rest; the _Ovis Tragelaphus_, the bearded sheep of Africa; the\r\n_Ovis Musmon_, the Musmon of Southern Europe; and the _Ovis Montana_,\r\nthe Mouflon of America; though it is believed by many naturalists that\r\nthis last is so nearly identical with the Indian Argali as to be\r\nundeserving a separate place. It is still a controversy to which of\r\nthese three we are indebted for the many breeds of modern domestication;\r\nthe Argali, however, by general belief, has been considered as the most\r\n_probable_ progenitor of the present varieties.\r\n\r\n685. THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY CHANGE OF CLIMATE, accident, and other\r\ncauses, must have been great to accomplish so complete a physical\r\nalteration as the primitive Argali must have undergone before the\r\nMusmon, or Mouflon of Corsica, the _immediate_ progenitor of all our\r\nEuropean breeds, assumed his present appearance. The Argali is about a\r\nfifth larger in size than the ordinary English sheep, and being a native\r\nof a tropical clime, his fleece is of hair instead of wool, and of a\r\nwarm reddish brown, approaching to yellow; a thick mane of darker hair,\r\nabout seven inches long, commences from two long tufts at the angle of\r\nthe jaws, and, running _under_ the throat and neck, descends down the\r\nchest, dividing, at the fore fork, into two parts, one running down the\r\nfront of each leg, as low as the shank. The horns, unlike the character\r\nof the order generally, have a quadrangular base, and, sweeping inwards,\r\nterminate in a sharp point. The tail, about seven inches long, ends in a\r\ntuft of stiff hairs. From this remarkable muffler-looking beard, the\r\nFrench have given the species the name of _Mouflon à manchettes_. From\r\nthe primitive stock _eleven_ varieties have been reared in this country,\r\nof the domesticated sheep, each supposed by their advocates to possess\r\nsome one or more special qualities. These eleven, embracing the Shetland\r\nor Orkney; the Dun-woolled; Black-faced, or heath-bred; the Moorland, or\r\nDevonshire; the Cheviot; the Horned, of Norfolk the Ryeland; South-Down;\r\nthe Merino; the Old Leicester, and the Teeswater, or New Leicester, have\r\nof late years been epitomized; and, for all useful and practical\r\npurposes, reduced to the following four orders:--\r\n\r\n686. THE SOUTH-DOWN, the LEICESTER, the BLACK-FACED, and the CHEVIOT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH-DOWN RAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH-DOWN EWE.]\r\n\r\n687. SOUTH-DOWNS.--It appears, as far as our investigation can trace the\r\nfact, that from the very earliest epoch of agricultural history in\r\nEngland, the breezy range of light chalky hills running through the\r\nsouth-west and south of Sussex and Hampshire, and known as the\r\nSouth-Downs, has been famous for a superior race of sheep; and we find\r\nthe Romans early established mills and a cloth-factory at Winchester,\r\nwhere they may be said to terminate, which rose to such estimation, from\r\nthe fineness of the wool and texture of the cloth, that the produce was\r\nkept as only worthy to clothe emperors. From this, it may be inferred\r\nthat sheep have always been indigenous to this hilly tract. Though\r\nboasting so remote a reputation, it is comparatively within late years\r\nthat the improvement and present state of perfection of this breed has\r\nbeen effected, the South-Down new ranking, for symmetry of shape,\r\nconstitution, and early maturity, with any stock in the kingdom. The\r\nSouth-Down has no horns, is covered with a fine wool from two to three\r\ninches long, has a small head, and legs and face of a grey colour. It\r\nis, however, considered deficient in depth and breadth of chest. A\r\nmarked peculiarity of this breed is that its hind quarters stand higher\r\nthan the fore, the quarters weighing from fifteen to eighteen pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEICESTER RAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEICESTER EWE.]\r\n\r\n688. THE LEICESTER.--It was not till the year 1755 that Mr. Robert\r\nBakewell directed his attention to the improvement of his stock of\r\nsheep, and ultimately effected that change in the character of his flock\r\nwhich has brought the breed to hold so prominent a place. The Leicester\r\nis regarded as the largest example of the improved breeds, very\r\nproductive, and yielding a good fleece. He has a small head, covered\r\nwith short white hairs, a clean muzzle, an open countenance, full eye,\r\nlong thin ear, tapering neck, well-arched ribs, and straight back. The\r\nmeat is indifferent, its flavour not being so good as that of the\r\nSouth-Down, and there is a very large proportion of fat. Average weight\r\nof carcase from 90 to 100 lbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEATH RAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEATH EWE.]\r\n\r\n689. BLACK-FACED, on HEATH-BRED SHEEP.--This is the most hardy of all\r\nour native breeds, and originally came from Ettrick Forest. The face and\r\nlegs are black, or sometimes mottled, the horns spiral, and on the top\r\nof the forehead it has a small round tuft of lighter-coloured wool than\r\non the face; has the muzzle and lips of the same light hue, and what\r\nshepherds call a mealy mouth; the eye is full of vivacity and fire, and\r\nwell open; the body long, round, and firm, and the limbs robust. The\r\nwool is thin, coarse, and light. Weight of the quarter, from 10 to 16\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\n690. THE CHEVIOT.--From the earliest traditions, these hills in the\r\nNorth, like the chalk-ridges in the South, have possessed a race of\r\nlarge-carcased sheep, producing a valuable fleece. To these physical\r\nadvantages, they added a sound constitution, remarkable vigour, and\r\ncapability to endure great privation. Both sexes are destitute of horns,\r\nface white, legs long and clean, carries the head erect, has the throat\r\nand neck well covered, the cars long and open, and the face animated.\r\nThe Cheviot is a small-boned sheep, and well covered with wool to the\r\nhough; the only defect in this breed, is in a want of depth in the\r\nchest. Weight of the quarter, from 12 to 18 lbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMNEY-MARSH RAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMNEY-MARSH EWE.]\r\n\r\n691. THOUGH THE ROMNEY MARSHES, that wide tract of morass and lowland\r\nmoor extending from the Weald (or ancient forest) of Kent into Sussex,\r\nhas rather been regarded as a general feeding-ground for any kind of\r\nsheep to be pastured on, it has yet, from the earliest date, been famous\r\nfor a breed of animals almost peculiar to the locality, and especially\r\nfor size, length, thickness, and quantity of wool, and what is called\r\nthickness of stocking; and on this account for ages held pre-eminence\r\nover every other breed in the kingdom. So satisfied were the Kentish men\r\nwith the superiority of their sheep, that they long resisted any\r\ncrossing in the breed. At length, however, this was effected, and from\r\nthe Old Romney and New Leicester a stock was produced that proved, in an\r\neminent degree, the advantage of the cross; and though the breed was\r\nactually smaller than the original, it was found that the new stock did\r\nnot consume so much food, the stocking was increased, they were ready\r\nfor the market a _year_ sooner; that the fat formed more on the exterior\r\nof the carcase, where it was of most advantage to the grazier, rather\r\nthan as formerly in the interior, where it went to the butcher as offal;\r\nand though the wool was shorter and lighter, it was of a better colour,\r\nfiner, and possessed of superior felting properties.\r\n\r\n692. THE ROMNEY MARSH BREED is a large animal, deep, close, and compact,\r\nwith white face and legs, and yields a heavy fleece of a good staple\r\nquality. The general structure is, however, considered defective, the\r\nchest being narrow and the extremities coarse; nevertheless its tendency\r\nto fatten, and its early maturity, are universally admitted. The Romney\r\nMarsh, therefore, though not ranking as a first class in respect of\r\nperfection and symmetry of breed, is a highly useful, profitable, and\r\ngenerally advantageous variety of the English domestic sheep.\r\n\r\n693. DIFFERENT NAMES HAVE BEEN GIVEN to sheep by their breeders,\r\naccording to their age and sex. The male is called a ram, or tup; after\r\nweaning, he is said to be a hog, or hogget, or a lamb-hog, tup-hog, or\r\nteg; later he is a wether, or wether-hog; after the first shearing, a\r\nshearing, or dinmont; and after each succeeding shearing, a two, three,\r\nor four-shear ram, tup, or wether, according to circumstances. The\r\nfemale is called a ewe, or gimmer-lamb, till weaned, when she becomes,\r\naccording to the shepherd's nomenclature, a gimmer-ewe, hog, or teg;\r\nafter shearing, a gimmer or shearing-ewe, or theave; and in future a\r\ntwo, three, or four-shear ewe, or theave.\r\n\r\n694. THE MODE OF SLAUGHTERING SHEEP is perhaps as humane and expeditious\r\na process as could be adopted to attain the objects sought: the animal\r\nbeing laid on its side in a sort of concave stool, the butcher, while\r\npressing the body with his knee, transfixes the throat near the angle of\r\nthe jaw, passing his knife between the windpipe and bones of the neck;\r\nthus dividing the jugulars, carotids, and large vessels, the death being\r\nvery rapid from such a hemorrhage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE OF MUTTON, SHOWING THE SEVERAL JOINTS.]\r\n\r\n695. ALMOST EVERY LARGE CITY has a particular manner of cutting up, or,\r\nas it is called, dressing the carcase. In London this process is very\r\nsimple, and as our butchers have found that much skewering back,\r\ndoubling one part over another, or scoring the inner cuticle or fell,\r\ntends to spoil the meat and shorten the time it would otherwise keep,\r\nthey avoid all such treatment entirely. The carcase when flayed (which\r\noperation is performed while yet warm), the sheep when hung up and the\r\nhead removed, presents the profile shown in our cut; the small numerals\r\nindicating the parts or joints into which one half of the animal is cut.\r\nAfter separating the hind from the fore quarters, with eleven ribs to\r\nthe latter, the quarters are usually subdivided in the manner shown in\r\nthe sketch, in which the several joins are defined by the intervening\r\nlines and figures. _Hind quarter_: No. 1, the leg; 2, the loin--the two,\r\nwhen cut in one piece, being called the saddle. _Fore quarter_: No. 3,\r\nthe shoulder; 4 and 5 the neck; No. 5 being called, for distinction, the\r\nscrag, which is generally afterwards separated from 4, the lower and\r\nbetter joint; No. 6, the breast. The haunch of mutton, so often served\r\nat public dinners and special entertainments, comprises all the leg and\r\nso much of the loin, short of the ribs or lap, as is indicated on the\r\nupper part of the carcase by a dotted line.\r\n\r\n696. THE GENTLE AND TIMID DISPOSITION of the sheep, and its defenceless\r\ncondition, must very early have attached it to man for motives less\r\nselfish than either its fleece or its flesh; for it has been proved\r\nbeyond a doubt that, obtuse as we generally regard it, it is susceptible\r\nof a high degree of domesticity, obedience, and affection. In many parts\r\nof Europe, where the flocks are guided by the shepherd's voice alone, it\r\nis no unusual thing for a sheep to quit the herd when called by its\r\nname, and follow the keeper like a dog. In the mountains of Scotland,\r\nwhen a flock is invaded by a savage dog, the rams have been known to\r\nform the herd into a circle, and placing themselves on the outside line,\r\nkeep the enemy at bay, or charging on him in a troop, have despatched\r\nhim with their horns.\r\n\r\n697. THE VALUE OF THE SHEEP seems to have been early understood by Adam\r\nin his fallen state; his skin not only affording him protection for his\r\nbody, but a covering for his tent; and accordingly, we find Abel\r\nintrusted with this portion of his father's stock; for the Bible tells\r\nus that \"Abel was a keeper of sheep.\" What other animals were\r\ndomesticated at that time we can only conjecture, or at what exact\r\nperiod the flesh of the sheep was first eaten for food by man, is\r\nequally, if not uncertain, open to controversy. For though some\r\nauthorities maintain the contrary, it is but natural to suppose that\r\nwhen Abel brought firstlings of his flock, \"and the fat thereof,\" as a\r\nsacrifice, the less dainty portions, not being oblations, were hardly\r\nlikely to have been flung away as refuse. Indeed, without supposing Adam\r\nand his descendants to have eaten animal food, we cannot reconcile the\r\nfact of Jubal Cain, Cain's son, and his family, living in tents, as they\r\nare reported to have done, knowing that both their own garments and the\r\ncoverings of the tents, were made from the hides and skins of the\r\nanimals they bred; for the number of sheep and oxen slain for oblations\r\nonly, would not have supplied sufficient material for two such necessary\r\npurposes. The opposite opinion is, that animal food was not eaten till\r\nafter the Flood, when the Lord renewed his covenant with Noah. From\r\nScriptural authority we learn many interesting facts as regards the\r\nsheep: the first, that mutton fat was considered the most delicious\r\nportion of any meat, and the tail and adjacent part the most exquisite\r\nmorsel in the whole body; consequently, such were regarded as especially\r\nfit for the offer of sacrifice. From this fact we may reasonably infer\r\nthat the animal still so often met with in Palestine and Syria, and\r\nknown as the Fat-tailed sheep, was in use in the days of the patriarchs,\r\nthough probably not then of the size and weight it now attains to; a\r\nsupposition that gains greater strength, when it is remembered that the\r\nram Abraham found in the bush, when he went to offer up Isaac, was a\r\nhorned animal, being entangled in the brake by his curved horns; so far\r\nproving that it belonged to the tribe of the Capridae, the fat-tailed\r\nsheep appertaining to the same family.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMBS.\r\n\r\n698. THOUGH THE LAMBING SEASON IN THIS COUNTRY usually commences in\r\nMarch, under the artificial system, so much pursued now to please the\r\nappetite of luxury, lambs can be procured at all seasons. When, however,\r\nthe sheep lambs in mid-winter, or the inclemency of the weather would\r\nendanger the lives of mother and young, if exposed to its influence, it\r\nis customary to rear the lambs within-doors, and under the shelter of\r\nstables or barns, where, foddered on soft hay, and part fed on cow's\r\nmilk, the little creatures thrive rapidly: to such it is customary to\r\ngive the name of House Lamb, to distinguish it from that reared in the\r\nopen air, or grass-fed. The ewe goes five months with her young, about\r\n152 days, or close on 22 weeks. The weaning season commences on poor\r\nlands, about the end of the third month, but on rich pasture not till\r\nthe close of the fourth--sometimes longer.\r\n\r\n699. FROM THE LARGE PROPORTION OF MOISTURE OR FLUIDS contained in the\r\ntissues of all young animals, the flesh of lamb and veal is much more\r\nprone, in close, damp weather, to become tainted and spoil than the\r\nflesh of the more mature, drier, and closer-textured beef and mutton.\r\nAmong epicures, the most delicious sorts of lamb are those of the\r\nSouth-Down breed, known by their black feet; and of these, those which\r\nhave been exclusively suckled on the milk of the parent ewe, are\r\nconsidered the finest. Next to these in estimation are those fed on the\r\nmilk of several dams, and last of all, though the fattest, the grass-fed\r\nlamb; this, however, implies an age much greater than either of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE OF LAMB.]\r\n\r\n700. LAMB, in the early part of the season, however reared, is in\r\nLondon, and indeed generally, sold in quarters, divided with eleven ribs\r\nto the forequarter; but, as the season advances, these are subdivided\r\ninto two, and the hind-quarter in the same manner; the first consisting\r\nof the shoulder, and the neck and breast; the latter, of the leg and the\r\nloin,--as shown in the cut illustrative of mutton. As lamb, from the\r\njuicy nature of its flesh, is especially liable to spoil in unfavourable\r\nweather, it should be frequently wiped, so as to remove any moisture\r\nthat may form on it.\r\n\r\n701. IN THE PURCHASING OF LAMB FOR THE TABLE, there are certain signs by\r\nwhich the experienced judgment is able to form an accurate opinion\r\nwhether the animal has been lately slaughtered, and whether the joints\r\npossess that condition of fibre indicative of good and wholesome meat.\r\nThe first of these doubts may be solved satisfactorily by the bright and\r\ndilated appearance of the eye; the quality of the fore-quarter can\r\nalways be guaranteed by the blue or healthy ruddiness of the jugular, or\r\nvein of the neck; while the rigidity of the knuckle, and the firm,\r\ncompact feel of the kidney, will answer in an equally positive manner\r\nfor the integrity of the hind-quarter.\r\n\r\n702.

INGREDIENTS.--Breast of mutton, bread crumbs, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\nminced savoury herbs (put a large proportion of parsley), pepper and\r\nsalt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut off the superfluous fat; bone it; sprinkle over a layer of\r\nbread crumbs, minced herbs, and seasoning; roll, and bind it up firmly.\r\nBoil _gently_ for 2 hours, remove the tape, and serve with caper sauce,\r\nNo. 382, a little of which should be poured over the meat.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED LEG OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n705. INGREDIENTS.--Mutton, water, salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--A. leg of mutton for boiling should not hang too long, as it\r\nwill not look a good colour when dressed. Cut off the shank-bone, trim\r\nthe knuckle, and wash and wipe it very clean; plunge it into sufficient\r\nboiling water to cover it; let it boil up, then draw the saucepan to the\r\nside of the fire, where it should remain till the finger can be borne in\r\nthe water. Then place it sufficiently near the fire, that the water may\r\ngently simmer, and be very careful that it does not boil fast, or the\r\nmeat will be hard. Skim well, add a little salt, and in about 2-1/4\r\nhours after the water begins to simmer, a moderate-sized leg of mutton\r\nwill be done. Serve with carrots and mashed turnips, which may be boiled\r\nwith the meat, and send caper sauce (No. 382) to table with it in a\r\ntureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A moderate-sized leg of mutton of 9 lbs., 2-1/4 hours after the\r\nwater boils; one of 12 lbs., 3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8-1/2d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--A moderate-sized leg of mutton for 6 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ nearly all the year, but not so good in June, July, and\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--When meat is liked very _thoroughly_ cooked, allow more time\r\nthan stated above. The liquor this joint was boiled in should be\r\nconverted into soup.\r\n\r\n    THE GOOD SHEPHERD.--The sheep's complete dependence upon the\r\n    shepherd for protection from its numerous enemies is frequently\r\n    referred to in the Bible; thus the Psalmist likens himself to a\r\n    lost sheep, and prays the Almighty to seek his servant; and our\r\n    Saviour, when despatching his twelve chosen disciples to preach\r\n    the Gospel amongst their unbelieving brethren, compares them to\r\n    lambs going amongst wolves. The shepherd of the East, by kind\r\n    treatment, calls forth from his sheep unmistakable signs of\r\n    affection. The sheep obey his voice and recognize the names by\r\n    which he calls them, and they follow him in and out of the fold.\r\n    The beautiful figure of the \"good shepherd,\" which so often\r\n    occurs in the New Testament, expresses the tenderness of the\r\n    Saviour for mankind. \"The good shepherd giveth his life for the\r\n    sheep.\"--_John_, x. 11. \"I am the good shepherd, and know my\r\n    sheep, and am known by mine.\"--_John_, x. 14. \"And other sheep I\r\n    have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and\r\n    they shall hear my voice: and there shall be one fold and one\r\n    shepherd.\"--_John_, x. 16.\r\n\r\nBONED LEG OF MUTTON STUFFED.\r\n\r\n706. INGREDIENTS.--A small leg of mutton, weighing 6 or 7 lbs.,\r\nforcemeat, No. 417, 2 shalots finely minced.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a forcemeat by recipe No. 417, to which add 2\r\nfinely-minced shalots. Bone the leg of mutton, without spoiling the\r\nskin, and cut off a great deal of the fat. Fill the hole up whence the\r\nbone was taken, with the forcemeat, and sew it up underneath, to prevent\r\nits falling out. Bind and tie it up compactly, and roast it before a\r\nnice clear fire for about 2-1/2 hours or rather longer; remove the tape\r\nand send it to table with a good gravy. It may be glazed or not, as\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 hours, or rather longer. _Average cost_, 4s. 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAISED FILLET OF MUTTON, with French Beans.\r\n\r\n707. INGREDIENTS.--The chump end of a loin of mutton, buttered paper,\r\nFrench beans, a little glaze, 1 pint of gravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Roll up the mutton in a piece of buttered paper, roast it for 2\r\nhours, and do not allow it to acquire the least colour. Have ready some\r\nFrench beans, boiled, and drained on a sieve; remove the paper from the\r\nmutton, glaze it; just heat up the beans in the gravy, and lay them on\r\nthe dish with the meat over them. The remainder of the gravy may be\r\nstrained, and sent to table in a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 8-1/2d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    VARIOUS QUALITIES OF MUTTON--Mutton is, undoubtedly, the meat\r\n    most generally used in families; and, both by connoisseurs and\r\n    medical men, it stands first in favour, whether its the favour,\r\n    digestible qualifications, or general wholesomeness, be\r\n    considered. Of all mutton, that furnished by South-Down sheep is\r\n    the most highly esteemed; it is also the dearest, on account of\r\n    its scarcity, and the great demand of it. Therefore, if the\r\n    housekeeper is told by the butcher that he has not any in his\r\n    shop, it should not occasion disappointment to the purchaser.\r\n    The London and other markets are chiefly supplied with sheep\r\n    called half-breeds, which are a cross between the Down and\r\n    Lincoln or Leicester. These half-breeds make a greater weight of\r\n    mutton than the true South-Downs, and, for this very desirable\r\n    qualification, they are preferred by the great sheep-masters.\r\n    The legs of this mutton range from 7 to 11 lbs. in weight; the\r\n    shoulders, necks, or loins, about 6 to 9 lbs.; and if care is\r\n    taken not to purchase it; the shoulders, necks, or loins, about\r\n    8 to 9 lbs.; and it cure is taken not to purchase it too fat, it\r\n    will be found the most satisfactory and economical mutton that\r\n    can be bought.\r\n\r\nBRAISED LEG OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n708. INGREDIENTS.--1 small leg of mutton, 4 carrots, 3 onions, 1 faggot\r\nof savoury herbs, a bunch of parsley, seasoning to taste of pepper and\r\nsalt, a few slices of bacon, a few veal trimmings, 1/2 pint of gravy or\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Line the bottom of a braising-pan with a few slices of bacon,\r\nput in the carrots, onions, herbs, parsley, and seasoning, and over\r\nthese place the mutton. Cover the whole with a few more slices of bacon\r\nand the veal trimmings, pour in the gravy or water, and stew very gently\r\nfor 4 hours. Strain the gravy, reduce it to a glaze over a sharp fire,\r\nglaze the mutton with it, and send it to table, placed on a dish of\r\nwhite haricot beans boiled tender, or garnished with glazed onions.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 hours. Average cost, 5s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE.--This order of knighthood was\r\n    founded by Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, in 1429, on the\r\n    day of his marriage with the Princess Isabella of Portugal. The\r\n    number of the members was originally fixed at thirty-one,\r\n    including the sovereign, as the head and chief of the\r\n    institution. In 1516, Pope Leo X. consented to increase the\r\n    number to fifty-two, including the head. In 1700 the German\r\n    emperor Charles VI. and King Philip of Spain both laid claim to\r\n    the order. The former, however, on leaving Spain, which he could\r\n    not maintain by force of arms, took with him, to Vienna, the\r\n    archives of the order, the inauguration of which he solemnized\r\n    there in 1713, with great magnificence; but Philip V. of Spain\r\n    declared himself Grand Master, and formally protested, at the\r\n    congress of Cambrai (1721), against the pretensions of the\r\n    emperor. The dispute, though subsequently settled by the\r\n    intercession of France, England, and Holland, was frequently\r\n    renewed, until the order was tacitly introduced into both\r\n    countries, and it now passes by the respective names of the\r\n    Spanish or Austrian \"Order of the Golden Fleece,\" according to\r\n    the country where it is issued.\r\n\r\nAN EXCELLENT WAY TO COOK A BREAST OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n709. INGREDIENTS.--Breast of mutton, 2 onions, salt and pepper to taste,\r\nflour, a bunch of savoury herbs, green peas.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the mutton into pieces about 2 inches square, and let it be\r\ntolerably lean; put it into a stewpan, with a little fat or butter, and\r\nfry it of a nice brown; then dredge in a little flour, slice the onions,\r\nand put it with the herbs in the stewpan; pour in sufficient water\r\n_just_ to cover the meat, and simmer the whole gently until the mutton\r\nis tender. Take out the meat, strain, and skim off all the fat from the\r\ngravy, and put both the meat and gravy back into the stewpan; add about\r\na quart of young green peas, and let them boil gently until done. 2 or 3\r\nslices of bacon added and stewed with the mutton give additional\r\nflavour; and, to insure the peas being a beautiful green colour, they\r\nmay be boiled in water separately, and added to the stew at the moment\r\nof serving.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to August.\r\n\r\n    NAMES OF ANIMALS SAXON, AND OF THEIR FLESH NORMAN.--The names of\r\n    all our domestic animals are of Saxon origin; but it is curious\r\n    to observe that Norman names have been given to the different\r\n    sorts of flesh which these animals yield. How beautifully this\r\n    illustrates the relative position of Saxon and Norman after the\r\n    Conquest. The Saxon hind had the charge of tending and feeding\r\n    the domestic animals, but only that they might appear on the\r\n    table of his Norman lord. Thus 'ox,' 'steer,' 'cow,' are Saxon,\r\n    but 'beef' is Norman; 'calf' is Saxon, but 'veal' Norman;\r\n    'sheep' is Saxon, but 'mutton' Norman; so it is severally with\r\n    'deer' and 'venison,' 'swine' and 'pork,' 'fowl' and 'pullet.'\r\n    'Bacon,' the only flesh which, perhaps, ever came within his\r\n    reach, is the single exception.\r\n\r\nBROILED MUTTON AND TOMATO SAUCE (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n710. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of cold mutton, tomato sauce, No. 529.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut some nice slices from a cold leg or shoulder of mutton;\r\nseason them with pepper and salt, and broil over a clear fire. Make some\r\ntomato sauce by recipe No. 529, pour it over the mutton, and serve. This\r\nmakes an excellent dish, and must be served very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 5 minutes to broil the mutton.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in September and October, when tomatoes are plentiful and\r\nseasonable.\r\n\r\n    SHEPHERDS AND THEIR FLOCKS.--The shepherd's crook is older than\r\n    either the husbandman's plough or the warrior's sword. We are\r\n    told that Abel was a keeper of sheep. Many passages in holy writ\r\n    enable us to appreciate the pastoral riches of the first eastern\r\n    nations; and we can form an idea of the number of their flocks,\r\n    when we read that Jacob gave the children of Hamor a hundred\r\n    sheep for the price of a field, and that the king of Israel\r\n    received a hundred thousand every year from the king of Moab,\r\n    his tributary, and a like number of rams covered with their\r\n    fleece. The tendency which most sheep have to ramble, renders it\r\n    necessary for them to be attended by a shepherd. To keep a flock\r\n    within bounds, is no easy task; but the watchful shepherd\r\n    manages to accomplish it without harassing the sheep. In the\r\n    Highlands of Scotland, where the herbage is scanty, the\r\n    sheep-farm requires to be very large, and to be watched over by\r\n    many shepherds. The farms of some of the great Scottish\r\n    landowners are of enormous extent. \"How many sheep have you on\r\n    your estate?\" asked Prince Esterhazy of the duke of Argyll. \"I\r\n    have not the most remote idea,\" replied the duke; \"but I know\r\n    the shepherds number several thousands.\"\r\n\r\nBROILED MUTTON CHOPS.\r\n\r\n711. INGREDIENTS.--Loin of mutton, pepper and salt, a small piece of\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the chops from a well-hung tender loin of mutton, remove a\r\nportion of the fat, and trim them into a nice shape; slightly beat and\r\nlevel them; place the gridiron over a bright clear fire, rub the bars\r\nwith a little fat, and lay on the chops. Whilst broiling, frequently\r\nturn them, and in about 8 minutes they will be done. Season with pepper\r\nand salt, dish them on a very hot dish, rub a small piece of butter on\r\neach chop, and serve very hot and expeditiously.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 8 minutes. _Average cost_, 10d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 chop to each person.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINA CHILO.\r\n\r\n712. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of leg, loin, or neck of mutton, 2 onions,\r\n2 lettuces, 1 pint of green peas, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1 teaspoonful\r\nof pepper, 1/4 pint of water, 1/4 lb. of clarified butter; when liked, a\r\nlittle cayenne.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mince the above quantity of undressed leg, loin, or neck of\r\nmutton, adding a little of the fat, also minced; put it into a stewpan\r\nwith the remaining ingredients, previously shredding the lettuce and\r\nonion rather fine; closely cover the stewpan, after the ingredients have\r\nbeen well stirred, and simmer gently for rather more than 2 hours. Serve\r\nin a dish, with a border of rice round, the same as for curry.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to August.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRIED MUTTON (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n713. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of any joint of cold mutton, 2 onions,\r\n1/4 lb. of butter, 1 dessertspoonful of curry powder, 1 dessertspoonful\r\nof flour, salt to taste, 1/4 pint of stock or water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice the onions in thin rings, and put them into a stewpan\r\nwith the butter, and fry of a light brown; stir in the curry powder,\r\nflour, and salt, and mix all well together. Cut the meat into nice thin\r\nslices (if there is not sufficient to do this, it may be minced), and\r\nadd it to the other ingredients; when well browned, add the stock or\r\ngravy, and stew gently for about 1/2 hour. Serve in a dish with a border\r\nof boiled rice, the same as for other curries.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTLETS OF COLD MUTTON (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n714. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold loin or neck of mutton, 1 egg,\r\nbread crumbs, brown gravy (No. 436), or tomato sauce (No. 529).\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the remains of cold loin or neck of mutton into cutlets,\r\ntrim them, and take away a portion of the fat, should there be too much;\r\ndip them in beaten egg, and sprinkle with bread crumbs, and fry them a\r\nnice brown in hot dripping. Arrange them on a dish, and pour round them\r\neither a good gravy or hot tomato sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 7 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Tomatoes to be had most reasonably in September and\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\nDORMERS.\r\n\r\n715. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of cold mutton, 2 oz. of beef suet, pepper\r\nand salt to taste, 3 oz. of boiled rice, 1 egg, bread crumbs, made\r\ngravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the meat, suet, and rice finely; mix well together, and\r\nadd a high seasoning of pepper and salt, and roll into sausages; cover\r\nthem with egg and bread crumbs, and fry in hot dripping of a nice brown.\r\nServe in a dish with made gravy poured round them, and a little in a\r\ntureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to fry the sausages.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    THE GOLDEN FLEECE.--The ancient fable of the Golden Fleece may\r\n    be thus briefly told:--Phryxus, a son of Athamus, king of\r\n    Thebes, to escape the persecutions of his stepmother Ino, paid a\r\n    visit to his friend Aeetes, king of Colchis. A ram, whose fleece\r\n    was of pure gold, carried the youth through the air in a most\r\n    obliging manner to the court of his friend. When safe At\r\n    Colchis, Phryxus offered the ram on the altars of Mars, and\r\n    pocketed the fleece. The king received him with great kindness,\r\n    and gave him his daughter Chalciope in marriage; but, some time\r\n    after, he murdered him in order to obtain possession of the\r\n    precious fleece. The murder of Phryxus was amply revenged by the\r\n    Greeks. It gave rise to the famous Argonautic expedition,\r\n    undertaken by Jason and fifty of the most celebrated heroes of\r\n    Greece. The Argonauts recovered the fleece by the help of the\r\n    celebrated sorceress Medea, daughter of Aeetes, who fell\r\n    desperately in love with the gallant but faithless Jason. In the\r\n    story of the voyage of the Argo, a substratum of truth probably\r\n    exists, though overlaid by a mass of fiction. The ram which\r\n    carried Phryxus to Colchis is by some supposed to have been the\r\n    name of the ship in which he embarked. The fleece of gold is\r\n    thought to represent the immense treasures he bore away from\r\n    Thebes. The alchemists of the fifteenth century were firmly\r\n    convinced that the Golden Fleece was a treatise on the\r\n    transmutation of metals, written on sheepskin.\r\n\r\nHARICOT MUTTON.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n716. INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs. of the middle or best end of the neck of\r\nmutton, 3 carrots, 3 turnips, 3 onions, popper and salt to taste, 1\r\ntablespoonful of ketchup or Harvey's sauce.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Trim off some of the fat, cut the mutton into rather thin\r\nchops, and put them into a frying-pan with the fat trimmings. Fry of a\r\npale brown, but do not cook them enough for eating. Cut the carrots and\r\nturnips into dice, and the onions into slices, and slightly fry them in\r\nthe same fat that the mutton was browned in, but do not allow them to\r\ntake any colour. Now lay the mutton at the bottom of a stewpan, then the\r\nvegetables, and pour over them just sufficient boiling water to cover\r\nthe whole. Give one boil, skim well, and then set the pan on the side of\r\nthe fire to simmer gently until the meat is tender. Skim off every\r\nparticle of fat, add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and a little\r\nketchup, and serve. This dish is very much better if made the day before\r\nit is wanted for table, as the fat can be so much more easily removed\r\nwhen the gravy is cold. This should be particularly attended to, as it\r\nis apt to be rather rich and greasy if eaten the same day it is made. It\r\nshould be served in rather a deep dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 hours to simmer gently.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 3s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n717. INGREDIENTS.--Breast or scrag of mutton, flour, pepper and salt to\r\ntaste, 1 large onion, 3 cloves, a bunch of savoury herbs, 1 blade of\r\nmace, carrots and turnips, sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the mutton into square pieces, and fry them a nice colour;\r\nthen dredge over them a little flour and a seasoning of pepper and salt.\r\nPut all into a stewpan, and moisten with boiling water, adding the\r\nonion, stuck with 3 cloves, the mace, and herbs. Simmer gently till the\r\nmeat is nearly done, skim off all the fat, and then add the carrots and\r\nturnips, which should previously be cut in dice and fried in a little\r\nsugar to colour them. Let the whole simmer again for 10 minutes; take\r\nout the onion and bunch of herbs, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3 hours to simmer.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARICOT MUTTON (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n718. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold neck or loin of mutton, 2 oz. of\r\nbutter, 3 onions, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1/2 pint of good gravy,\r\npepper and salt to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of port wine, 1 tablespoonful\r\nof mushroom ketchup, 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 1 head of celery.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the cold mutton into moderate-sized chops, and take off the\r\nfat; slice the onions, and fry them with the chops, in a little butter,\r\nof a nice brown colour; stir in the flour, add the gravy, and let it\r\nstew gently nearly an hour. In the mean time boil the vegetables until\r\n_nearly_ tender, slice them, and add them to the mutton about 1/4 hour\r\nbefore it is to be served. Season with pepper and salt, add the ketchup\r\nand port wine, give one boil, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold meat, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nHASHED MUTTON.\r\n\r\n719. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast shoulder or leg of mutton,\r\n6 whole peppers, 6 whole allspice, a faggot of savoury herbs, 1/2 head\r\nof celery, 1 onion, 2 oz. of butter, flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the meat in nice even slices from the bones, trimming off\r\nall superfluous fat and gristle; chop the bones and fragments of the\r\njoint, put them into a stewpan with the pepper, spice, herbs, and\r\ncelery; cover with water, and simmer for 1 hour. Slice and fry the onion\r\nof a nice pale-brown colour, dredge in a little flour to make it thick,\r\nand add this to the bones, &c. Stew for 1/4 hour, strain the gravy, and\r\nlet it cool; then skim off every particle of fat, and put it, with the\r\nmeat, into a stewpan. Flavour with ketchup, Harvey's sauce; tomato\r\nsauce, or any flavouring that may be preferred, and let the meat\r\ngradually warm through, but not boil, or it will harden. To hash meat\r\nproperly, it should be laid in cold gravy, and only left on the fire\r\njust long enough to warm through.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour to simmer the gravy.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    HASHED MUTTON.--Many persons express a decided aversion to\r\n    hashed mutton; and, doubtless, this dislike has arisen from the\r\n    fact that they have unfortunately never been properly served\r\n    with this dish. If properly done, however, the meat tender (it\r\n    ought to be as tender as when first roasted), the gravy abundant\r\n    and well flavoured, and the sippets nicely toasted, and the\r\n    whole served neatly; then, hashed mutton is by no means to be\r\n    despised, and is infinitely more wholesome and appetizing than\r\n    the cold leg or shoulder, of which fathers and husbands, and\r\n    their bachelor friends, stand in such natural awe.\r\n\r\nHODGE-PODGE (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n720. INGREDIENTS.--About 1 lb. of underdone cold mutton, 2 lettuces, 1\r\npint of green peas, 5 or 6 green onions, 2 oz. of butter, pepper and\r\nsalt to taste, 1/2 teacupful of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mince the mutton, and cut up the lettuces and onions in slices.\r\nPut these in a stewpan, with all the ingredients except the peas, and\r\nlet these simmer very gently for 3/4 hour, keeping them well stirred.\r\nBoil the peas separately, mix these with the mutton, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the end of May to August.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH STEW.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n721. INGREDIENTS.--3 lbs. of the loin or neck of mutton, 5 lbs. of\r\npotatoes, 5 large onions, pepper and salt to taste, rather more than 1\r\npint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Trim off some of the fat of the above quantity of loin or neck\r\nof mutton, and cut it into chops of a moderate thickness. Pare and halve\r\nthe potatoes, and cut the onions into thick slices. Put a layer of\r\npotatoes at the bottom of a stewpan, then a layer of mutton and onions,\r\nand season with pepper and salt; proceed in this manner until the\r\nstewpan is full, taking care to have plenty of vegetables at the top.\r\nPour in the water, and let it stew very gently for 2-1/2 hours, keeping\r\nthe lid of the stewpan closely shut the _whole_ time, and occasionally\r\nshaking it to prevent its burning.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 2s. 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--More suitable for a winter dish.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n722. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 lbs. of the breast of mutton, 1-1/2 pint of\r\nwater, salt and pepper to taste, 4 lbs. of potatoes, 4 large onions.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the mutton into a stewpan with the water and a little salt,\r\nand let it stew gently for an hour; cut the meat into small pieces, skim\r\nthe fat from the gravy, and pare and slice the potatoes and onions. Put\r\nall the ingredients into the stewpan in layers, first a layer of\r\nvegetables, then one of meat, and sprinkle seasoning of pepper and salt\r\nbetween each layer; cover closely, and let the whole stew very gently\r\nfor 1 hour of rather more, shaking it frequently to prevent its burning.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Suitable for a winter dish.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Irish stew may be prepared in the same manner as above, but\r\nbaked in a jar instead of boiled. About 2 hours or rather more in a\r\nmoderate oven will be sufficient time to bake it.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN MUTTON CUTLETS.\r\n\r\n723. INGREDIENTS.--About 3 lbs. of the neck of mutton, clarified butter,\r\nthe yolk of 1 egg, 4 tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nminced savoury herbs, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful\r\nof minced shalot, 1 saltspoonful of finely-chopped lemon-peel; pepper,\r\nsalt, and pounded mace to taste; flour, 1/2 pint of hot broth or water,\r\n2 teaspoonfuls of Harvey's sauce, 1 teaspoonful of soy, 2 teaspoonfuls\r\nof tarragon vinegar, 1 tablespoonful of port wine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the mutton into nicely-shaped cutlets, flatten them, and\r\ntrim off some of the fat, dip them in clarified butter, and then, into\r\nthe beaten yolk of an egg. Mix well together bread crumbs, herbs,\r\nparsley, shalot, lemon-peel, and seasoning in the above proportion, and\r\ncover the cutlets with these ingredients. Melt some butter in a\r\nfrying-pan, lay in the cutlets, and fry them a nice brown; take them,\r\nout, and keep them hot before the fire. Dredge some flour into the pan,\r\nand if there is not sufficient butter, add a little more; stir till it\r\nlooks brown, then pour in the hot broth or water, and the remaining\r\ningredients; give one boil, and pour round the cutlets. If the gravy\r\nshould not be thick enough, add a little more flour. Mushrooms, when\r\nobtainable, are a great improvement to this dish, and when not in\r\nseason, mushroom-powder may be substituted for them.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes;--rather longer, should the cutlets be very thick.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    THE DOWNS.--The well-known substance chalk, which the chemist\r\n    regards as a nearly pure carbonate of lime, and the microscopist\r\n    as an aggregation of inconceivably minute shells and corals,\r\n    forms the sub-soil of the hilly districts of the south-east of\r\n    England. The chalk-hills known as the South Downs start from the\r\n    bold promontory of Beachy Head, traverse the county of Sussex\r\n    from east to west, and pass through Hampshire into Surrey. The\r\n    North Downs extend from Godalming, by Godstone, into Kent, and\r\n    terminate in the line of cliffs which stretches from Dover to\r\n    Ramsgate. The Downs are clothed with short verdant turf; but the\r\n    layer of soil which rests upon the chalk is too thin to support\r\n    trees and shrubs. The hills have rounded summits, and their\r\n    smooth, undulated outlines are unbroken save by the sepulchral\r\n    monuments of the early inhabitants of the country. The coombes\r\n    and furrows, which ramify and extend into deep valleys, appear\r\n    like dried-up channels of streams and rivulets. From time\r\n    immemorial, immense flocks of sheep have been reared on these\r\n    downs. The herbage of these hills is remarkably nutritious; and\r\n    whilst the natural healthiness of the climate, consequent on the\r\n    dryness of the air and the moderate elevation of the land, is\r\n    eminently favourable to rearing a superior race of sheep, the\r\n    arable land in the immediate neighbourhood of the Downs affords\r\n    the means of a supply of other food, when the natural produce of\r\n    the hills fails. The mutton of the South-Down breed of sheep is\r\n    highly valued for its delicate flavour, and the wool for its\r\n    fineness; but the best specimens of this breed, when imported\r\n    from England into the West Indies, become miserably lean in the\r\n    course of a year or two, and their woolly fleece gives place to\r\n    a covering of short, crisp, brownish hair.\r\n\r\nBROILED KIDNEYS (a Breakfast or Supper Dish).\r\n\r\n724. INGREDIENTS.--Sheep kidneys, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Ascertain that the kidneys are fresh, and cut them open very\r\nevenly, lengthwise, down to the root, for should one half be thicker\r\nthan the other, one would be underdone whilst the other would be dried,\r\nbut do not separate them; skin them, and pass a skewer under the white\r\npart of each half to keep them flat, and broil over a nice clear fire,\r\nplacing the inside downwards; turn them when done enough on one side,\r\nand cook them on the other. Remove the skewers, place the kidneys on a\r\nvery hot dish, season with pepper and salt, and put a tiny piece of\r\nbutter in the middle of each; serve very hot and quickly, and send very\r\nhot plates to table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--6 to 8 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1-1/2d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 for each person.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A prettier dish than the above may be made by serving the\r\nkidneys each on a piece of buttered toast out in any fanciful shape. In\r\nthis case a little lemon-juice will be found an improvement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KIDNEYS.]\r\n\r\nFRIED KIDNEYS.\r\n\r\n725. INGREDIENTS.--Kidneys, butter, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the kidneys open without quite dividing them, remove the\r\nskin, and put a small piece of butter in the frying-pan. When the butter\r\nis melted, lay in the kidneys the flat side downwards, and fry them for\r\n7 or 8 minutes, turning them when they are half-done. Serve on a piece\r\nof dry toast, season with pepper and salt, and put a small piece of\r\nbutter in each kidney; pour the gravy from the pan over them, and serve\r\nvery hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--7 or 8 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1-1/2d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 kidney to each person.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST HAUNCH OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAUNCH OF MUTTON.]\r\n\r\n726. INGREDIENTS.--Haunch of mutton, a little salt, flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let this joint hang as long as possible without becoming\r\ntainted, and while hanging dust flour over it, which keeps off the\r\nflies, and prevents the air from getting to it. If not well hung, the\r\njoint, when it comes to table, will neither do credit to the butcher or\r\nthe cook, as it will not be tender. Wash the outside well, lest it\r\nshould have a bad flavour from keeping; then flour it and put it down to\r\na nice brisk fire, at some distance, so that it may gradually warm\r\nthrough. Keep continually basting, and about 1/2 hour before it is\r\nserved, draw it nearer to the fire to get nicely brown. Sprinkle a\r\nlittle fine salt over the meat, pour off the dripping, add a little\r\nboiling water slightly salted, and strain this over the joint. Place a\r\npaper ruche on the bone, and send red-currant jelly and gravy in a\r\ntureen to table with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 4 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 to 10 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--In best season from September to March.\r\n\r\n    HOW TO BUY MEAT ECONOMICALLY.--If the housekeeper is not very\r\n    particular as to the precise joints to cook for dinner, there is\r\n    oftentimes an opportunity for her to save as much money in her\r\n    purchases of meat as will pay for the bread to eat with it. It\r\n    often occurs, for instance, that the butcher may have a\r\n    superfluity of certain joints, and these he would be glad to get\r\n    rid of at a reduction of sometimes as much as 1d. or 1-1/2d. per\r\n    lb., and thus, in a joint of 8 or 9 lbs., will be saved enough\r\n    to buy 2 quartern loaves. It frequently happens with many\r\n    butchers, that, in consequence of a demand for legs and loins of\r\n    mutton, they have only shoulders left, and these they will be\r\n    glad to sell at a reduction.\r\n\r\nROAST LEG OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEG OF MUTTON.]\r\n\r\n727. INGREDIENTS.--Leg of mutton, a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--As mutton, when freshly killed, is never tender, hang it almost\r\nas long as it will keep; flour it, and put it in a cool airy place for a\r\nfew days, if the weather will permit. Wash off the flour, wipe it very\r\ndry, and cut off the shank-bone; put it down to a brisk clear fire,\r\ndredge with flour, and keep continually basting the whole time it is\r\ncooking. About 20 minutes before serving, draw it near the fire to get\r\nnicely brown; sprinkle over it a little salt, dish the meat, pour off\r\nthe dripping, add some boiling water slightly salted, strain it over the\r\njoint, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A leg of mutton weighing 10 lbs., about 2-1/4 or 2-1/2 hours;\r\none of 7 lbs., about 2 hours, or rather less.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8-1/2d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--A moderate-sized leg of mutton sufficient for 6 or 8\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time, but not so good in June, July, and August.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST LOIN OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n728. INGREDIENTS.--Loin of mutton, a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut and trim off the superfluous fat, and see that the butcher\r\njoints the meat properly, as thereby much annoyance is saved to the\r\ncarver, when it comes to table. Have ready a nice clear fire (it need\r\nnot be a very wide large one), put down the meat, dredge with flour, and\r\nbaste well until it is done. Make the gravy as for roast leg of mutton,\r\nand serve very hot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOIN OF MUTTON.]\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A loin of mutton weighing 6 lbs., 1-1/2 hour, or rather longer.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8-1/2d. per lb. _Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\nROLLED LOIN OF MUTTON (Very Excellent).\r\n\r\n729. INGREDIENTS.--About 6 lbs. of a loin of mutton, 1/2 teaspoonful of\r\npepper, 1/4 teaspoonful of pounded allspice, 1/4 teaspoonful of mace,\r\n1/4 teaspoonful of nutmeg, 6 cloves, forcemeat No. 417, 1 glass of port\r\nwine, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Hang the mutton till tender, bone it, and sprinkle over it\r\npepper, mace, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg in the above proportion, all\r\nof which must be pounded very fine. Let it remain for a day, then make a\r\nforcemeat by recipe No. 417, cover the meat with it, and roll and bind\r\nit up firmly. Half bake it in a slow oven, let it grow cold, take off\r\nthe fat, and put the gravy into a stewpan; flour the meat, put it in the\r\ngravy, and stew it till perfectly tender. Now take out the meat, unbind\r\nit, add to the gravy wine and ketchup as above, give one boil, and pour\r\nover the meat. Serve with red-currant jelly; and, if obtainable, a few\r\nmushrooms stewed for a few minutes in the gravy, will be found a great\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour to bake the meat, 1-1/2 hour to stew gently.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4s. 9d. _Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This joint will be found very nice if rolled and stuffed, as\r\nhere directed, and plainly roasted. It should be well basted, and served\r\nwith a good gravy and currant jelly.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED NECK OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n730. INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs. of the middle, or best end of the neck of\r\nmutton; a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Trim off a portion of the fat, should there be too much, and if\r\nit is to look particularly nice, the chine-bone should be sawn down, the\r\nribs stripped halfway down, and the ends of the bones chopped off; this\r\nis, however, not necessary. Put the meat into sufficient _boiling_ water\r\nto cover it; when it boils, add a little salt and remove all the scum.\r\nDraw the saucepan to the side of the fire, and let the water get so cool\r\nthat the finger may be borne in it; then simmer very _slowly_ and gently\r\nuntil the meat is done, which will be in about 1-1/2 hour, or rather\r\nmore, reckoning from the time that it begins to simmer.\r\n\r\nServe with turnips and caper sauce, No. 382, and pour a little of it\r\nover the meat. The turnips should be boiled with the mutton; and, when\r\nat hand, a few carrots will also be found an improvement. These,\r\nhowever, if very large and thick, must be cut into long thinnish pieces,\r\nor they will not be sufficiently done by the time the mutton is ready.\r\nGarnish the dish with carrots and turnips placed alternately round the\r\nmutton.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 lbs. of the neck of mutton, about 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8-1/2 d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    THE POETS ON SHEEP.--The keeping of flocks seems to have been\r\n    the first employment of mankind; and the most ancient sort of\r\n    poetry was probably pastoral. The poem known as the Pastoral\r\n    gives a picture of the life of the simple shepherds of the\r\n    golden age, who are supposed to have beguiled their time in\r\n    singing. In all pastorals, repeated allusions are made to the\r\n    \"fleecy flocks,\" the \"milk-white lambs,\" and \"the tender ewes;\"\r\n    indeed, the sheep occupy a position in these poems inferior only\r\n    to that of the shepherds who tend them. The \"nibbling sheep\" has\r\n    ever been a favourite of the poets, and has supplied them with\r\n    figures and similes without end. Shakspere frequently compares\r\n    men to sheep. When Gloster rudely drives the lieutenant from the\r\n    side of Henry VI., the poor king thus touchingly speaks of his\r\n    helplessness;--\r\n\r\n      \"So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf:\r\n       So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece,\r\n       And next his throat, unto the butcher's knife.\"\r\n\r\n    In the \"Two Gentlemen of Verona,\" we meet with the following\r\n    humorous comparison:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Proteus_. The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd, the\r\n    shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for wages\r\n    followest thy master, thy master for wages follows not thee;\r\n    therefore, thou art a sheep.\r\n\r\n    \"_Speed_. Such another proof will make me cry _baa_.\"\r\n\r\n    The descriptive poets give us some charming pictures of sheep.\r\n    Every one is familiar with the sheep-shearing scene in Thomson's\r\n    \"Seasons:\"--\r\n\r\n      \"Heavy and dripping, to the breezy brow\r\n      Slow move the harmless race; where, as they spread\r\n      Their dwelling treasures to the sunny ray,\r\n      Inly disturb'd, and wond'ring what this wild\r\n      Outrageous tumult means, their loud complaints\r\n      The country fill; and, toss'd from rock to rock,\r\n      Incessant bleatings run around the hills.\"\r\n\r\n    What an exquisite idea of stillness is conveyed in the\r\n    oft-quoted line from Gray's \"Elegy:\"--\r\n\r\n      \"And drowsy tinklings lull the distant fold.\"\r\n\r\n    From Dyer's quaint poem of \"The Fleece\" we could cull a hundred\r\n    passages relating to sheep; but we have already exceeded our\r\n    space. We cannot, however, close this brief notice of the\r\n    allusions that have been made to sheep by our poets, without\r\n    quoting a couple of verses from Robert Burns's \"Elegy on Poor\r\n    Mailie,\" his only \"pet _yowe_:\"--\r\n\r\n      \"Thro' a' the town she troll'd by him;\r\n      A lang half-mile she could descry him;\r\n      Wi' kindly bleat, when she did spy him.\r\n                  She ran wi' speed;\r\n      A friend mair faithfu' ne'er cam' nigh him\r\n                  Than Mailie dead.\r\n\r\n      \"I wat she was a sheep o' sense.\r\n      An' could behave hersel' wi' mense;\r\n      I'll say't, she never brak a fence,\r\n                  Thro' thievish greed.\r\n      Our bardie, lanely, keeps the spence,\r\n                  Sin' Mailie's dead.\"\r\n\r\nMUTTON COLLOPS (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n731. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of a cold leg or loin of mutton, salt\r\nand pepper to taste, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 small bunch of savoury\r\nherbs minced very fine, 2 or 3 shalots, 2 or 3 oz. of butter, 1\r\ndessertspoonful of flour, 1/2 pint of gravy, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nlemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut some very thin slices from a leg or the chump end of a loin\r\nof mutton; sprinkle them with pepper, salt, pounded mace, minced savoury\r\nherbs, and minced shalot; fry them in butter, stir in a dessertspoonful\r\nof flour, add the gravy and lemon-juice, simmer very gently about 5 or 7\r\nminutes, and serve immediately.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 to 7 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUTTON CUTLETS.]\r\n\r\nMUTTON CUTLETS WITH MASHED POTATOES.\r\n\r\n732. INGREDIENTS.--About 3 lbs. of the best end of the neck of mutton,\r\nsalt and pepper to taste, mashed potatoes.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure a well-hung neck of mutton, saw off about 3 inches of\r\nthe top of the bones, and cut the cutlets of a moderate thickness. Shape\r\nthem by chopping off the thick part of the chine-bone; beat them flat\r\nwith a cutlet-chopper, and scrape quite clean, a portion of the top of\r\nthe bone. Broil them over a nice clear fire for about 7 or 8 minutes,\r\nand turn them frequently. Have ready some smoothly-mashed white\r\npotatoes; place these in the middle of the dish; when the cutlets are\r\ndone, season with pepper and salt; arrange them round the potatoes, with\r\nthe thick end of the cutlets downwards, and serve very hot and quickly.\r\n(See Coloured Plate.)\r\n\r\n_Time_.--7 or 8 minutes. _Average cost_, for this quantity, 2s. 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Cutlets may be served in various ways; with peas, tomatoes,\r\nonions, sauce piquante, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUTTON PIE (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n733. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of a cold leg, loin, or neck of mutton,\r\npepper and salt to taste, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1 dessertspoonful of\r\nchopped parsley, 1 teaspoonful of minced savoury herbs; when liked, a\r\nlittle minced onion or shalot; 3 or 4 potatoes, 1 teacupful of gravy;\r\ncrust.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cold mutton may be made into very good pies if well seasoned\r\nand mixed with a few herbs; if the leg is used, cut it into very thin\r\nslices; if the loin or neck, into thin cutlets. Place some at the bottom\r\nof the dish; season well with pepper, salt, mace, parsley, and herbs;\r\nthen put a layer of potatoes sliced, then more mutton, and so on till\r\nthe dish is full; add the gravy, cover with a crust, and bake for 1\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The remains of an underdone leg of mutton may be converted into\r\na very good family pudding, by cutting the meat into slices, and putting\r\nthem into a basin lined with a suet crust. It should be seasoned well\r\nwith pepper, salt, and minced shalot, covered with a crust, and boiled\r\nfor about 3 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUTTON PIE.\r\n\r\n734. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of the neck or loin of mutton, weighed after\r\nbeing boned; 2 kidneys, pepper and salt to taste, 2 teacupfuls of gravy\r\nor water, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced parsley; when liked, a little\r\nminced onion or shalot; puff crust.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Bone the mutton, and cut the meat into steaks all of the same\r\nthickness, and leave but very little fat. Cut up the kidneys, and\r\narrange these with the meat neatly in a pie-dish; sprinkle over them the\r\nminced parsley and a seasoning of pepper and salt; pour in the gravy,\r\nand cover with a tolerably good puff crust. Bake for 1-1/2 hour, or\r\nrather longer, should the pie be very large, and let the oven be rather\r\nbrisk. A well-made suet crust may be used instead of puff crust, and\r\nwill be found exceedingly good.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour, or rather longer. _Average cost_, 2s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUTTON PUDDING.\r\n\r\n735. INGREDIENTS.--About 2 lbs. of the chump end of the loin of mutton,\r\nweighed after being boned; pepper and salt to taste, suet crust made\r\nwith milk (see Pastry), in the proportion of 6 oz. of suet to each pound\r\nof flour; a very small quantity of minced onion (this may be omitted\r\nwhen the flavour is not liked).\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the meat into rather thin slices, and season them with\r\npepper and salt; line the pudding-dish with crust; lay in the meat, and\r\nnearly, but do not quite, fill it up with water; when the flavour is\r\nliked, add a small quantity of minced onion; cover with crust, and\r\nproceed in the same manner as directed in recipe No. 605, using the same\r\nkind of pudding-dish as there mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but more suitable in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGOUT OF COLD NECK OF MUTTON (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n736.

When this is quite brown, add the water, and the carrots and\r\nturnips, which should be cut into very thin slices; season with pepper\r\nand salt, and stew till quite tender, which will be in about 3/4 hour.\r\nWhen in season, green peas may be substituted for the carrots and\r\nturnips: they should be piled in the centre of the dish, and the chops\r\nlaid round.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_, with peas, from June to August.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST NECK OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NECK OF MUTTON 1-2. _Best end_. 2-3. _Scrag_.]\r\n\r\n737. INGREDIENTS.--Neck of mutton; a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--For roasting, choose the middle, or the best end, of the neck\r\nof mutton, and if there is a very large proportion of fat, trim off some\r\nof it, and save it for making into suet puddings, which will be found\r\nexceedingly good. Let the bones be cut short and see that it is properly\r\njointed before it is laid down to the fire, as they will be more easily\r\nseparated when they come to table. Place the joint at a nice brisk\r\nfire, dredge it with flour, and keep continually basting until done. A\r\nfew minutes before serving, draw it nearer the the fire to acquire a\r\nnice colour, sprinkle over it a little salt, pour off the dripping, add\r\na little boiling water slightly salted, strain this over the meat and\r\nserve. Red-currant jelly may be sent to table with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 lbs. of the neck of mutton, rather more than 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8-1/2d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    WOOLLEN MANUFACTURES.--The distinction between hair and wool is\r\n    rather arbitrary than natural, consisting in the greater or less\r\n    degrees of fineness, softness and pliability of the fibres.\r\n    When the fibres possess these properties so far as to admit of\r\n    their being spun and woven into a texture sufficiently pliable\r\n    to be used as an article of dress, they are called wool. The\r\n    sheep, llama, Angora goat, and the goat of Thibet, are the\r\n    animals from which most of the wool used in manufactures is\r\n    obtained. The finest of all wools is that from the goat of\r\n    Thibet, of which the Cashmere shawls are made. Of European\r\n    wools, the finest is that yielded by the Merino sheep, the\r\n    Spanish and Saxon breeds taking the precedence. The Merino\r\n    sheep, as now naturalized in Australia, furnishes an excellent\r\n    fleece; but all varieties of sheep-wool, reared either in Europe\r\n    or Australia are inferior in softness of feel to that grown in\r\n    India, and to that of the llama of the Andes. The best of our\r\n    British wools are inferior in fineness to any of the\r\n    above-mentioned, being nearly twelve times the thickness of the\r\n    finest Spanish merino; but for the ordinary purposes of the\r\n    manufacturer, they are unrivalled.\r\n\r\nROAST SADDLE OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SADDLE OF MUTTON.]\r\n\r\n738. INGREDIENTS.--Saddle of mutton; a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--To insure this joint being tender, let it hang for ten days or\r\na fortnight, if the weather permits. Cut off the tail and flaps and trim\r\naway every part that has not indisputable pretensions to be eaten, and\r\nhave the skin taken off and skewered on again. Put it down to a bright,\r\nclear fire, and, when the joint has been cooking for an hour, remove the\r\nskin and dredge it with flour. It should not be placed too near the\r\nfire, as the fat should not be in the slightest degree burnt. Keep\r\nconstantly basting, both before and after the skin is removed; sprinkle\r\nsome salt over the joint. Make a little gravy in the dripping-pan; pour\r\nit over the meat, which send to table with a tureen of made gravy and\r\nred-currant jelly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A saddle of mutton weighing 10 lbs., 2-1/2 hours; 14 lbs.,\r\n3-1/4 hours. When liked underdone, allow rather less time.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--A moderate-sized saddle of 10 lbs. for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year; not so good when lamb is in full season.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST SHOULDER OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n739. INGREDIENTS.--Shoulder of mutton; a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the joint down to a bright, clear fire; flour it well, and\r\nkeep continually basting. About 1/4 hour before serving, draw it near\r\nthe fire, that the outside may acquire a nice brown colour, but not\r\nsufficiently near to blacken the fat. Sprinkle a little fine salt over\r\nthe meat, empty the dripping-pan of its contents, pour in a little\r\nboiling water slightly salted, and strain this over the joint. Onion\r\nsauce, or stewed Spanish onions, are usually sent to table with this\r\ndish, and sometimes baked potatoes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A shoulder of mutton weighing 6 or 7 lbs., 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Shoulder of mutton may be dressed in a variety of ways; boiled,\r\nand served with onion sauce; boned, and stuffed with a good veal\r\nforcemeat; or baked, with sliced potatoes in the dripping-pan.\r\n\r\n    THE ETTRICK SHEPHERD.--James Hogg was perhaps the most\r\n    remarkable man that ever wore the _maud_ of a shepherd. Under\r\n    the garb, aspect, and bearing of a rude peasant (and rude enough\r\n    he was in most of these things, even after no inconsiderable\r\n    experience of society), the world soon discovered a true poet.\r\n    He taught himself to write, by copying the letters of a printed\r\n    book as he lay watching his flock on the hillside, and believed\r\n    that he had reached the utmost pitch of his ambition when he\r\n    first found that his artless rhymes could touch the heart of the\r\n    ewe-milker who partook the shelter of his mantle during the\r\n    passing storm. If \"the shepherd\" of Professor Wilson's \"Noctes\r\n    Ambrosianae\" may be taken as a true portrait of James Hogg, we\r\n    must admit that, for quaintness of humour, the poet of Ettrick\r\n    Forest had few rivals. Sir Walter Scott said that Hogg's\r\n    thousand little touches of absurdity afforded him more\r\n    entertainment than the best comedy that ever set the pit in a\r\n    roar. Among the written productions of the shepherd-poet, is an\r\n    account of his own experiences in sheep-tending, called \"The\r\n    Shepherd's Calender.\" This work contains a vast amount of useful\r\n    information upon sheep, their diseases, habits, and management.\r\n    The Ettrick Shepherd died in 1835.\r\n\r\nSHEEP'S BRAINS, EN MATELOTE (an Entree).\r\n\r\n740. INGREDIENTS.--6 sheep's brains, vinegar, salt, a few slices of\r\nbacon, 1 small onion, 2 cloves, a small bunch of parsley, sufficient\r\nstock or weak broth to cover the brains, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice,\r\nmatelote sauce, No. 512.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Detach the brains from the heads without breaking them, and put\r\nthem into a pan of warm water; remove the skin, and let them remain for\r\ntwo hours. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, add a little vinegar\r\nand salt, and put in the brains. When they are quite firm, take them out\r\nand put them into very cold water. Place 2 or 3 slices of bacon in a\r\nstewpan, put in the brains, the onion stuck with 2 cloves, the parsley,\r\nand a good seasoning of pepper and salt; cover with stock, or weak\r\nbroth, and boil them gently for about 25 minutes. Have ready some\r\ncroûtons; arrange these in the dish alternately with the brains, and\r\ncover with a matelote sauce, No. 512, to which has been added the above\r\nproportion of lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--25 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\nSHEEP'S FEET or TROTTERS (Soyer's Recipe).\r\n\r\n741.

Let these simmer for 3 hours, or until\r\nperfectly tender, and take them and lay them on a sieve. Mix together,\r\non a plate, with the back of a spoon, butter, salt, flour (1\r\nteaspoonful), pepper, nutmeg, and lemon-juice as above, and put the\r\nfeet, with a gill of milk, into a stewpan. When very hot, add the\r\nbutter, &c., and stir continually till melted. Now mix the yolks of 2\r\neggs with 5 tablespoonfuls of milk; stir this to the other ingredients,\r\nkeep moving the pan over the fire continually for a minute or two, but\r\ndo not allow it to boil after the eggs are added. Serve in a very hot\r\ndish, and garnish with croûtons, or sippets of toasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DRESS A SHEEP'S HEAD.\r\n\r\n742.

Keep stirring till it\r\nboils up; then shut the saucepan closely, and let it stew gently for\r\n1-1/2 or 2 hours. It may be thickened with rice or barley, but oatmeal\r\nis preferable.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 or 2 hours. _Average cost_, 8d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    SINGED SHEEP'S HEAD.--The village of Dudingston, which stands\r\n    \"within a mile of Edinburgh town,\" was formerly celebrated for\r\n    this ancient and homely Scottish dish. In the summer months,\r\n    many opulent citizens used to resort to this place to solace\r\n    themselves over singed sheep's heads, boiled or baked. The sheep\r\n    fed upon the neighbouring hills were slaughtered at this\r\n    village, and the carcases were sent to town; but the heads were\r\n    left to be consumed in the place. We are not aware whether the\r\n    custom of eating sheep's heads at Dudingston is still kept up by\r\n    the good folks of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nTOAD-IN-THE-HOLE (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n743. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of flour, 1 pint of milk, 3 eggs, butter, a few\r\nslices of cold mutton, pepper and salt to taste, 2 kidneys.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a smooth batter of flour, milk, and eggs in the above\r\nproportion; butter a baking-dish, and pour in the batter. Into this\r\nplace a few slices of cold mutton, previously well seasoned, and the\r\nkidneys, which should be cut into rather small pieces; bake about 1\r\nhour, or rather longer, and send it to table in the dish it was baked\r\nin. Oysters or mushrooms may be substituted for the kidneys, and will be\r\nfound exceedingly good.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold meat, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAST OF LAMB AND GREEN PEAS.\r\n\r\n744. INGREDIENTS.--1 breast of lamb, a few slices of bacon, 1/4 pint of\r\nstock No. 105, 1 lemon, 1 onion, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, green peas.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Remove the skin from a breast of lamb, put it into a saucepan\r\nof boiling water, and let it simmer for 5 minutes. Take it out and lay\r\nit in cold water. Line the bottom of a stewpan with a few thin slices of\r\nbacon; lay the lamb on these; peel the lemon, cut it into slices, and\r\nput these on the meat, to keep it white and make it tender; cover with 1\r\nor 2 more slices of bacon; add the stock, onion, and herbs, and set it\r\non a slow fire to simmer very gently until tender. Have ready some green\r\npeas, put these on a dish, and place the lamb on the top of these. The\r\nappearance of this dish may be much improved by glazing the lamb, and\r\nspinach may be substituted for the peas when variety is desired.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 10d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_,--grass lamb, from Easter to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n    THE LAMB AS A SACRIFICE.--The number of lambs consumed in\r\n    sacrifices by the Hebrews must have been very considerable. Two\r\n    lambs \"of the first year\" were appointed to be sacrificed daily\r\n    for the morning and evening sacrifice; and a lamb served as a\r\n    substitute for the first-born of unclean animals, such as the\r\n    ass, which could not be accepted as an offering to the Lord.\r\n    Every year, also, on the anniversary of the deliverance of the\r\n    children of Israel from the bondage of Egypt, every family was\r\n    ordered to sacrifice a lamb or kid, and to sprinkle some of its\r\n    blood upon the door-posts, in commemoration of the judgment of\r\n    God upon the Egyptians. It was to be eaten roasted, with\r\n    unleavened bread and bitter herbs, in haste, with the loins\r\n    girded, the shoes on the feet, and the staff in the hand; and\r\n    whatever remained until the morning was to be burnt. The sheep\r\n    was also used in the numerous special, individual, and national\r\n    sacrifices ordered by the Jewish law. On extraordinary\r\n    occasions, vast quantities of sheep were sacrificed at once;\r\n    thus Solomon, on the completion of the temple, offered \"sheep\r\n    and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.\"\r\n\r\nSTEWED BREAST OF LAMB.\r\n\r\n745. INGREDIENTS.--1 breast of lamb, pepper and salt to taste,\r\nsufficient stock, No. 105, to cover it, 1 glass of sherry, thickening of\r\nbutter and flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Skin the lamb, cut it into pieces, and season them with pepper\r\nand salt; lay these in a stewpan, pour in sufficient stock or gravy to\r\ncover them, and stew very gently until tender, which will be in about\r\n1-1/2 hour. Just before serving, thicken the sauce with a little butter\r\nand flour; add the sherry, give one boil, and pour it over the meat.\r\nGreen peas, or stewed mushrooms, may be strewed over the meat, and will\r\nbe found a very great improvement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 10d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_,--grass lamb, from Easter to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMB CHOPS.\r\n\r\n746. INGREDIENTS.--Loin of lamb, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Trim off the flap from a fine loin of lamb, aid cut it into\r\nchops about 3/4 inch in thickness. Have ready a bright clear fire; lay\r\nthe chops on a gridiron, and broil them of a nice pale brown, turning\r\nthem when required. Season them with pepper and salt; serve very hot and\r\nquickly, and garnish with crisped parsley, or place them on mashed\r\npotatoes. Asparagus, spinach, or peas are the favourite accompaniments\r\nto lamb chops.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 8 or 10 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 2 chops to each person.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from Easter to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMB CUTLETS AND SPINACH (an Entree).\r\n\r\n747. INGREDIENTS.--8 cutlets, egg and bread crumbs, salt and pepper to\r\ntaste, a little clarified butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the cutlets from a neck of lamb, and shape them by cutting\r\noff the thick part of the chine-bone. Trim off most of the fat and all\r\nthe skin, and scrape the top part of the bones quite clean. Brush the\r\ncutlets over with egg, sprinkle them with bread crumbs, and season with\r\npepper and salt. Now dip them into clarified butter, sprinkle over a few\r\nmore bread crumbs, and fry them over a sharp fire, turning them when\r\nrequired. Lay them before the fire to drain, and arrange them on a dish\r\nwith spinach in the centre, which should be previously well boiled,\r\ndrained, chopped, and seasoned.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 7 or 8 minutes. _Average cost_, 10d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from Easter to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Peas, asparagus, or French beans, may be substituted for the\r\nspinach; or lamb cutlets may be served with stewed cucumbers, Soubise\r\nsauce, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMB'S FRY.\r\n\r\n748. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of lamb's fry, 3 pints of water, egg and bread\r\ncrumbs, 1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley, salt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the fry for 1/4 hour in the above proportion of water,\r\ntake it out and dry it in a cloth; grate some bread down finely, mix\r\nwith it a teaspoonful of chopped parsley and a high seasoning of pepper\r\nand salt. Brush the fry lightly over with the yolk of an egg, sprinkle\r\nover the bread crumbs, and fry for 5 minutes. Serve very hot on a napkin\r\nin a dish, and garnish with plenty of crisped parsley.\r\n\r\n_Time_.-1 hour to simmer the fry, 5 minutes to fry it.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 or 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from Easter to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nHASHED LAMB AND BROILED BLADE-BONE.\r\n\r\n749.

Season the bone with pepper and salt,\r\npour a little oiled butter over it, and place it in the oven to warm\r\nthrough. Put the stock into a stewpan, add the ketchup and shalot\r\nvinegar, and lay in the pieces of lamb. Let these heat gradually\r\nthrough, but do not allow them to boil. Take the blade-bone out of the\r\noven, and place it on a gridiron over a sharp fire to brown. Slice the\r\ngherkins, put them into the hash, and dish it with the blade-bone in the\r\ncentre. It may be garnished with croutons or sippets of toasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_,--house lamb, from Christmas to March; grass lamb, from\r\nEaster to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB.]\r\n\r\nROAST FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB.\r\n\r\n750. INGREDIENTS.--Lamb, a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--To obtain the flavour of lamb in perfection, it should not be\r\nlong kept; time to cool is all that it requires; and though the meat may\r\nbe somewhat thready, the juices and flavour will be infinitely superior\r\nto that of lamb that has been killed 2 or 3 days. Make up the fire in\r\ngood time, that it may be clear and brisk when the joint is put down.\r\nPlace it at a sufficient distance to prevent the fat from burning, and\r\nbaste it constantly till the moment of serving. Lamb should be very\r\n_thoroughly_ done without being dried up, and not the slightest\r\nappearance of red gravy should be visible, as in roast mutton: this rule\r\nis applicable to all young white meats. Serve with a little gravy made\r\nin the dripping-pan, the same as for other roasts, and send to table\r\nwith it a tureen of mint sauce, No. 469, and a fresh salad. A cut lemon,\r\na small piece of fresh butter, and a little cayenne, should also be\r\nplaced on the table, so that when the carver separates the shoulder from\r\nthe ribs, they may be ready for his use; if, however, he should not be\r\nvery expert, we would recommend that the cook should divide these joints\r\nnicely before coming to table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Fore-quarter of lamb weighing 10 lbs., 1-3/4 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. to 1s. per lb. _Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_,--grass lamb, from Easter to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED LEG OF LAMB A LA BECHAMEL.\r\n\r\n751. INGREDIENTS.--Leg of lamb, Béchamel sauce, No. 367.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Do not choose a very large joint, but one weighing about 5 lbs.\r\nHave ready a saucepan of boiling water, into which plunge the lamb, and\r\nwhen it boils up again, draw it to the side of the fire, and let the\r\nwater cool a little. Then stew very gently for about 1-1/4 hour,\r\nreckoning from the time that the water begins to simmer. Make some\r\nBéchamel by recipe No. 367, dish the lamb, pour the sauce over it, and\r\ngarnish with tufts of boiled cauliflower or carrots. When liked, melted\r\nbutter may be substituted for the Béchamel: this is a more simple\r\nmethod, but not nearly so nice. Send to table with it some of the sauce\r\nin a tureen, and boiled cauliflowers or spinach, with whichever\r\nvegetable the dish is garnished.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/4 hour after the water simmers.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. to 1s. per lb. _Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from Easter to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST LEG OF LAMB.\r\n\r\n752. INGREDIENTS.--Lamb, a little salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEG OF LAMB.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Place the joint at a good distance from the fire at first, and\r\nbaste well the whole time it is cooking. When nearly done, draw it\r\nnearer the fire to acquire a nice brown colour. Sprinkle a little fine\r\nsalt over the meat, empty the dripping-pan of its contents; pour in a\r\nlittle boiling water, and strain this over the meat. Serve with mint\r\nsauce and a fresh salad, and for vegetables send peas, spinach, or\r\ncauliflowers to table with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A leg of lamb weighing 5 lbs., 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. to 1s. per lb. _Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from Easter to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAISED LOIN OF LAMB.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOIN OF LAMB.]\r\n\r\n753. INGREDIENTS.--1 loin of lamb, a few slices of bacon, 1 bunch of\r\ngreen onions, 5 or 6 young carrots, a bunch of savoury herbs, 2 blades\r\nof pounded mace, 1 pint of stock, salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Bone a loin of lamb, and line the bottom of a stewpan just\r\ncapable of holding it, with a few thin slices of fat bacon; add the\r\nremaining ingredients, cover the meat with a few more slices of bacon,\r\npour in the stock, and simmer very _gently_ for 2 hours; take it up, dry\r\nit, strain and reduce the gravy to a glaze, with which glaze the meat,\r\nand serve it either on stewed peas, spinach, or stewed cucumbers.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 11d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient for_ 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from Easter to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SADDLE OF LAMB. RIBS OF LAMB.]\r\n\r\nROAST SADDLE OF LAMB.\r\n\r\n754. INGREDIENTS.--Lamb; a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--This joint is now very much in vogue, and is generally\r\nconsidered a nice one for a small party. Have ready a clear brisk fire;\r\nput down the joint at a little distance, to prevent the fat from\r\nscorching, and keep it well basted all the time it is cooking. Serve\r\nwith mint sauce and a fresh salad, and send to table with it, either\r\npeas, cauliflowers, or spinach.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A small saddle, 1-1/2 hour; a large one, 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. to 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from Easter to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Loin and ribs of lamb are roasted in the same manner, and\r\nserved with the same sauces as the above. A loin will take about 1-1/4\r\nhour; ribs, from 1 to 1-1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST SHOULDER OF LAMB.\r\n\r\n755. INGREDIENTS.--Lamb; a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have ready a clear brisk fire, and put down the joint at a\r\nsufficient distance from it, that the fat may not burn. Keep constantly\r\nbasting until done, and serve with a little gravy made in the\r\ndripping-pan, and send mint sauce to table with it. Peas, spinach, or\r\ncauliflowers are the usual vegetables served with lamb, and also a fresh\r\nsalad.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A shoulder of lamb rather more than 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10s. to 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from Easter to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOULDER OF LAMB STUFFED.\r\n\r\n756. INGREDIENTS.--Shoulder of lamb, forcemeat No. 417, trimmings of\r\nveal or beef, 2 onions, 1/2 head of celery, 1 faggot of savoury herbs, a\r\nfew slices of fat bacon, 1 quart of stock No. 105.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take the blade-bone out of a shoulder of lamb, fill up its\r\nplace with forcemeat, and sew it up with coarse thread. Put it into a\r\nstewpan with a few slices of bacon under and over the lamb, and add the\r\nremaining ingredients. Stew very gently for rather more than 2 hours.\r\nReduce the gravy, with which glaze the meat, and serve with peas, stewed\r\ncucumbers, or sorrel sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 2 hours. _Average cost_, 10d. to 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from Easter to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMB'S SWEETBREADS, LARDED, AND ASPARAGUS (an Entree).\r\n\r\n757. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 sweetbreads, 1/2 pint of veal stock, white\r\npepper and salt to taste, a small bunch of green onions, 1 blade of\r\npounded mace, thickening of butter and flour, 2 eggs, nearly 1/2 pint of\r\ncream, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, a very little grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Soak the sweetbreads in lukewarm water, and put them into a\r\nsaucepan with sufficient boiling water to cover them, and let them\r\nsimmer for 10 minutes; then take them out and put them into cold water.\r\nNow lard them, lay them in a stewpan, add the stock, seasoning, onions,\r\nmace, and a thickening of butter and flour, and stew gently for 1/4 hour\r\nor 20 minutes. Beat up the egg with the cream, to which add the minced\r\nparsley and a very little grated nutmeg. Put this to the other\r\ningredients; stir it well till quite hot, but do not let it boil after\r\nthe cream is added, or it will curdle. Have ready some asparagus-tops,\r\nboiled; add these to the sweetbreads, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_--3 sweetbreads for 1 entrée.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from Easter to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER WAY TO DRESS SWEETBREADS (an Entree).\r\n\r\n758. INGREDIENTS.--Sweetbreads, egg and bread crumbs, 1/2 pint of gravy,\r\nNo. 442, 1/2 glass of sherry.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Soak the sweetbreads in water for an hour, and throw them into\r\nboiling water to render them firm. Let them stew gently for about 1/4\r\nhour, take them out and put them into a cloth to drain all the water\r\nfrom them. Brush them over with egg, sprinkle them with bread crumbs,\r\nand either brown them in the oven or before the fire. Have ready the\r\nabove quantity of gravy, to which add 1/2 glass of sherry; dish the\r\nsweetbreads, pour the gravy under them, and garnish with water-cresses.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d.\r\neach.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_--3 sweetbreads for 1 entrée.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from Easter to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUTTON AND LAMB CARVING.\r\n\r\nHAUNCH OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAUNCH OF MUTTON.]\r\n\r\n759. A deep cut should, in the first place, be made quite down to the\r\nbone, across the knuckle-end of the joint, along the line 1 to 2. This\r\nwill let the gravy escape; and then it should be carved, in not too\r\nthick slices, along the whole length of the haunch, in the direction of\r\nthe line from 4 to 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEG OF MUTTON.]\r\n\r\nLEG OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n760. This homely, but capital English joint, is almost invariably served\r\nat table as shown in the engraving. The carving of it is not very\r\ndifficult: the knife should be carried sharply down in the direction of\r\nthe line from 1 to 2, and slices taken from either side, as the guests\r\nmay desire, some liking the knuckle-end, as well done, and others\r\npreferring the more underdone part. The fat should be sought near the\r\nline 3 to 4. Some connoisseurs are fond of having this joint dished with\r\nthe under-side uppermost, so as to get at the finely-grained meat lying\r\nunder that part of the meat, known as the Pope's eye; but this is an\r\nextravagant fashion, and one that will hardly find favour in the eyes of\r\nmany economical British housewives and housekeepers.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOIN OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOIN OF MUTTON.]\r\n\r\n761. There is one point in connection with carving a loin of mutton\r\nwhich includes every other; that is, that the joint should be thoroughly\r\nwell jointed by the butcher before it is cooked. This knack of jointing\r\nrequires practice and the proper tools; and no one but the butcher is\r\nsupposed to have these. If the bones be not well jointed, the carving of\r\na loin of mutton is not a gracious business; whereas, if that has been\r\nattended to, it is an easy and untroublesome task. The knife should be\r\ninserted at fig. 1, and after feeling your way between the bones, it\r\nshould be carried sharply in the direction of the line 1 to 2. As there\r\nare some people who prefer the outside cut, while others do not like it,\r\nthe question as to their choice of this should be asked.\r\n\r\n\r\nSADDLE OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SADDLE OF MUTTON.]\r\n\r\n762. Although we have heard, at various intervals, growlings expressed\r\nat the inevitable \"saddle of mutton\" at the dinner-parties of our middle\r\nclasses, yet we doubt whether any other joint is better liked, when it\r\nhas been well hung and artistically cooked. There is a diversity of\r\nopinion respecting the mode of sending this joint to table; but it has\r\nonly reference to whether or no there shall be any portion of the tail,\r\nor, if so, how many joints of the tail. We ourselves prefer the mode as\r\nshown in our coloured illustration \"O;\" but others may, upon equally\r\ngood grounds, like the way shown in the engraving on this page. Some\r\ntrim the tail with a paper frill. The carving is not difficult: it is\r\nusually cut in the direction of the line from 2 to 1, quite down to the\r\nbones, in evenly-sliced pieces. A fashion, however, patronized by some,\r\nis to carve it obliquely, in the direction of the line from 4 to 3; in\r\nwhich case the joint would be turned round the other way, having the\r\ntail end on the right of the carver.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOULDER OF MUTTON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOULDER OF MUTTON.]\r\n\r\n763. This is a joint not difficult to carve. The knife should be drawn\r\nfrom the outer edge of the shoulder in the direction of the line from 1\r\nto 2, until the bone of the shoulder is reached. As many slices as can\r\nbe carved in this manner should be taken, and afterwards the meat lying\r\non either side of the blade-bone should be served, by carving in the\r\ndirection of 3 to 4 and 3 to 4. The uppermost side of the shoulder being\r\nnow finished, the joint should be turned, and slices taken off along its\r\nwhole length. There are some who prefer this under-side of the shoulder\r\nfor its juicy flesh, although the grain of the meat is not so fine as\r\nthat on the other side.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORE-QUARTER OF LAMB.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB.]\r\n\r\n764. We always think that a good and practised carver delights in the\r\nmanipulation of this joint, for there is a little field for his judgment\r\nand dexterity which does not always occur. The separation of the\r\nshoulder from the breast is the first point to be attended to; this is\r\ndone by passing the knife lightly round the dotted line, as shown by the\r\nfigures 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, so as to cut through the skin, and then, by\r\nraising with a little force the shoulder, into which the fork should be\r\nfirmly fixed, it will come away with just a little more exercise of the\r\nknife. In dividing the shoulder and breast, the carver should take care\r\nnot to cut away too much of the meat from the latter, as that would\r\nrather spoil its appearance when the shoulder is removed. The breast and\r\nshoulder being separated, it is usual to lay a small piece of butter,\r\nand sprinkle a little cayenne, lemon-juice, and salt between them; and\r\nwhen this is melted and incorporated with the meat and gravy, the\r\nshoulder may, as more convenient, be removed into another dish. The,\r\nnext operation is to separate the ribs from the brisket, by cutting\r\nthrough the meat on the line 5 to 6. The joint is then ready to be\r\nserved to the guests; the ribs being carved in the direction of the\r\nlines from 9 to 10, and the brisket from 7 to 8. The carver should ask\r\nthose at the table what parts they prefer-ribs, brisket, or a piece of\r\nthe shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEG OF LAMB, LOIN OF LAMB, SADDLE OF LAMB, SHOULDER OF LAMB,\r\n\r\nare carved in the same manner as the corresponding joints of mutton.\r\n(_See_ Nos. 760, 761, 762, 763.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE COMMON HOG.\r\n\r\n765. THE HOG belongs to the order _Mammalia_, the genus _Sus scrofa_,\r\nand the species _Pachydermata_, or thick-skinned; and its generic\r\ncharacters are, a small head, with long flexible snout truncated; 42\r\nteeth, divided into 4 upper incisors, converging, 6 lower incisors,\r\nprojecting, 2 upper and 2 lower canine, or tusks,--the former short, the\r\nlatter projecting, formidable, and sharp, and 14 molars in each jaw;\r\ncloven feet furnished with 4 toes, and tail, small, short, and twisted;\r\nwhile, in some varieties, this appendage is altogether wanting.\r\n\r\n766. FROM THE NUMBER AND POSITION OF THE TEETH, physiologists are\r\nenabled to define the nature and functions of the animal; and from those\r\nof the _Sus_, or hog, it is evident that he is as much a _grinder_ as a\r\n_biter_, or can live as well on vegetable as on animal food; though a\r\nmixture of both is plainly indicated as the character of food most\r\nconducive to the integrity and health of its physical system.\r\n\r\n767. THUS THE PIG TRIBE, though not a ruminating mammal, as might be\r\ninferred from the number of its molar teeth, is yet a link between the\r\n_herbivorous_ and the _carnivorous_ tribes, and is consequently what is\r\nknown as an _omnivorous_ quadruped; or, in other words, capable of\r\nconverting any kind of aliment into nutriment.\r\n\r\n768. THOUGH THE HOOF IN THE HOG is, as a general rule, cloven, there are\r\nseveral remarkable exceptions, as in the species native to Norway,\r\nIllyria, Sardinia, and _formerly_ to the Berkshire variety of the\r\nBritish domesticated pig, in which the hoof is entire and _un_cleft.\r\n\r\n769. WHATEVER DIFFERENCE IN ITS PHYSICAL NATURE, climate and soil may\r\nproduce in this animal, his functional characteristics are the same in\r\nwhatever part of the world he may be found; and whether in the trackless\r\nforests of South America, the coral isles of Polynesia, the jungles of\r\nIndia, or the spicy brakes of Sumatra, he is everywhere known for his\r\ngluttony, laziness, and indifference to the character and quality of his\r\nfood. And though he occasionally shows an epicure's relish for a\r\nsucculent plant or a luscious carrot, which he will discuss with all his\r\nsalivary organs keenly excited, he will, the next moment, turn with\r\nequal gusto to some carrion offal that might excite the forbearance of\r\nthe unscrupulous cormorant. It is this coarse and repulsive mode of\r\nfeeding that has, in every country and language, obtained for him the\r\nopprobrium of being \"an unclean animal.\"\r\n\r\n770. IN THE MOSAICAL LAW, the pig is condemned as an unclean beast, and\r\nconsequently interdicted to the Israelites, as unfit for human food.\r\n\"And the swine, though he divideth the hoof and be cloven-footed, yet he\r\ncheweth not the cud. He is unclean to you.\"--Lev. xi. 7. Strict,\r\nhowever, as the law was respecting the cud-chewing and hoof-divided\r\nanimals, the Jews, with their usual perversity and violation of the\r\ndivine commands, seem afterwards to have ignored the prohibition; for,\r\nunless they ate pork, it is difficult to conceive for what purpose they\r\nkept troves of swine, as from the circumstance recorded in Matthew\r\nxviii. 32, when Jesus was in Galilee, and the devils, cast out of the\r\ntwo men, were permitted to enter the herd of swine that were feeding on\r\nthe hills in the neighbourhood of the Sea of Tiberias, it is very\r\nevident they did. There is only one interpretation by which we can\r\naccount for a prohibition that debarred the Jews from so many foods\r\nwhich we regard as nutritious luxuries, that, being fat and the texture\r\nmore hard of digestion than other meats, they were likely, in a hot dry\r\nclimate, where vigorous exercise could seldom be taken, to produce\r\ndisease, and especially cutaneous affections; indeed, in this light, as\r\na code of sanitary ethics, the book of Leviticus is the most admirable\r\nsystem of moral government ever conceived for man's benefit.\r\n\r\n771. SETTING HIS COARSE FEEDING AND SLOVENLY HABITS OUT OF THE QUESTION,\r\nthere is no domestic animal so profitable or so useful to man as the\r\nmuch-maligned pig, or any that yields him a more varied or more\r\nluxurious repast. The prolific powers of the pig are extraordinary, even\r\nunder the restraint of domestication; but when left to run wild in\r\nfavourable situations, as in the islands of the South Pacific, the\r\nresult, in a few years, from two animals put on shore and left\r\nundisturbed, is truly surprising; for they breed so fast, and have such\r\nnumerous litters, that unless killed off in vast numbers both for the\r\nuse of the inhabitants and as fresh provisions for ships' crews, they\r\nwould degenerate into vermin. In this country the pig has usually two\r\nlitters, or farrows, in a year, the breeding seasons being April and\r\nOctober; and the period the female goes with her young is about four\r\nmonths,--16 weeks or 122 days. The number produced at each litter\r\ndepends upon the character of the breed; 12 being the average number in\r\nthe small variety, and 10 in the large; in the mixed breeds, however,\r\nthe average is between 10 and 15, and in some instances has reached as\r\nmany as 20. But however few, or however many, young pigs there may be to\r\nthe farrow, there is always one who is the dwarf of the family circle, a\r\npoor, little, shrivelled, half-starved anatomy, with a small melancholy\r\nvoice, a staggering gait, a woe-begone countenance, and a thread of a\r\ntail, whose existence the complacent mother ignores, his plethoric\r\nbrothers and sisters repudiate, and for whose emaciated jaws there is\r\nnever a spare or supplemental teat, till one of the favoured\r\ngormandizers, overtaken by momentary oblivion, drops the lacteal\r\nfountain, and gives the little squeaking straggler the chance of a\r\nmomentary mouthful. This miserable little object, which may be seen\r\nbringing up the rear of every litter, is called the Tony pig, or the\r\n_Anthony_; so named, it is presumed, from being the one always assigned\r\nto the Church, when tithe was taken in kind; and as St. Anthony was the\r\npatron of husbandry, his name was given in a sort of bitter derision to\r\nthe starveling that constituted his dues; for whether there are ten or\r\nfifteen farrows to the litter, the Anthony is always the last of the\r\nfamily to come into the world.\r\n\r\n772. FROM THE GROSSNESS OF HIS FEEDING, the large amount of aliment he\r\nconsumes, his gluttonous way of eating it, from his slothful habits,\r\nlaziness, and indulgence in sleep, the pig is particularly liable to\r\ndisease, and especially indigestion, heartburn, and affections of the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\n773. TO COUNTERACT THE CONSEQUENCE OF A VIOLATION OF THE PHYSICAL LAWS,\r\na powerful monitor in the brain of the pig teaches him to seek for\r\nrelief and medicine. To open the pores of his skin, blocked up with mud,\r\nand excite perspiration, he resorts to a tree, a stump, or his\r\ntrough--anything rough and angular, and using it as a curry-comb to his\r\nbody, obtains the luxury of a scratch and the benefit of cuticular\r\nevaporation; he next proceeds with his long supple snout to grub up\r\nantiscorbutic roots, cooling salads of mallow and dandelion, and,\r\ngreatest treat of all, he stumbles on a piece of chalk or a mouthful of\r\ndelicious cinder, which, he knows by instinct, is the most sovereign\r\nremedy in the world for that hot, unpleasant sensation he has had all\r\nthe morning at his stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n774. IT IS A REMARKABLE FACT that, though every one who keeps a pig\r\nknows how prone he is to disease, how that disease injures the quality\r\nof the meat, and how eagerly he pounces on a bit of coal or cinder, or\r\nany coarse dry substance that will adulterate the rich food on which he\r\nlives, and by affording soda to his system, correct the vitiated fluids\r\nof his body,--yet very few have the judgment to act on what they see,\r\nand by supplying the pig with a few shovelfuls of cinders in his sty,\r\nsave the necessity of his rooting for what is so needful to his health.\r\nInstead of this, however, and without supplying the animal with what its\r\ninstinct craves for, his nostril is bored with a red-hot iron, and a\r\nring clinched in his nose to prevent rooting for what he feels to be\r\nabsolutely necessary for his health; and ignoring the fact that, in a\r\ndomestic state at least, the pig lives on the richest of all\r\nfood,--scraps of cooked animal substances, boiled vegetables, bread, and\r\nother items, given in that concentrated essence of aliment for a\r\nquadruped called wash, and that he eats to repletion, takes no exercise,\r\nand finally sleeps all the twenty-four hours he is not eating, and then,\r\nwhen the animal at last seeks for those medicinal aids which would\r\nobviate the evil of such a forcing diet, his keeper, instead of meeting\r\nhis animal instinct by human reason, and giving him what he seeks, has\r\nthe inhumanity to torture him by a ring, that, keeping up a perpetual\r\n\"raw\" in the pig's snout, prevents his digging for those corrective\r\ndrugs which would remove the evils of his artificial existence.\r\n\r\n775. THOUGH SUBJECT TO SO MANY DISEASES, no domestic animal is more\r\neasily kept in health, cleanliness, and comfort, and this without the\r\nnecessity of \"ringing,\" or any excessive desire of the hog to roam,\r\nbreak through his sty, or plough up his _pound_. Whatever the kind of\r\nfood may be on which the pig is being fed or fattened, a teaspoonful or\r\nmore of salt should always be given in his mess of food, and a little\r\nheap of well-burnt cinders, with occasional bits of chalk, should always\r\nbe kept by the side of his trough, as well as a vessel of clean water:\r\nhis pound, or the front part of his sty, should be totally free from\r\nstraw, the brick flooring being every day swept out and sprinkled with a\r\nlayer of sand. His lair, or sleeping apartment, should be well sheltered\r\nby roof and sides from cold, wet, and all changes of weather, and the\r\nbed made up of a good supply of clean straw, sufficiently deep to enable\r\nthe pig to burrow his unprotected body beneath it. All the refuse of the\r\ngarden, in the shape of roots, leaves, and stalks, should be placed in a\r\ncorner of his pound or feeding-chamber, for the delectation of his\r\nleisure moments; and once a week, on the family washing-day, a pail of\r\nwarm soap-suds should be taken into his sty, and, by means of a\r\nscrubbing-brush and soap, his back, shoulders, and flanks should be well\r\ncleaned, a pail of clean warm water being thrown over his body at the\r\nconclusion, before he is allowed to retreat to his clean straw to dry\r\nhimself. By this means, the excessive nutrition of his aliment will be\r\ncorrected, a more perfect digestion insured, and, by opening the pores\r\nof the skin, a more vigorous state of health acquired than could have\r\nbeen obtained under any other system.\r\n\r\n776. WE HAVE ALREADY SAID that no other animal yields man so _many_\r\nkinds and varieties of luxurious food as is supplied to him by the flesh\r\nof the hog differently prepared; for almost every part of the animal,\r\neither fresh, salted, or dried, is used for food; and even those viscera\r\nnot so employed are of the utmost utility in a domestic point of view.\r\n\r\n777. THOUGH DESTITUTE OF THE HIDE, HORNS, AND HOOFS, constituting the\r\noffal of most domestic animals, the pig is not behind the other mammalia\r\nin its usefulness to man. Its skin, especially that of the boar, from\r\nits extreme closeness of texture, when tanned, is employed for the seats\r\nof saddles, to cover powder, shot, and drinking-flasks; and the hair,\r\naccording to its colour, flexibility, and stubbornness, is manufactured\r\ninto tooth, nail, and hairbrushes,--others into hat, clothes, and\r\nshoe-brushes; while the longer and finer qualities are made into long\r\nand short brooms and painters' brushes; and a still more rigid\r\ndescription, under the name of \"bristles,\" are used by the shoemaker as\r\nneedles for the passage of his wax-end. Besides so many benefits and\r\nuseful services conferred on man by this valuable animal, his fat, in a\r\ncommercial sense, is quite as important as his flesh, and brings a price\r\nequal to the best joints in the carcase. This fat is rendered, or melted\r\nout of the caul, or membrane in which it is contained, by boiling water,\r\nand, while liquid, run into prepared bladders, when, under the name of\r\n_lard_, it becomes an article of extensive trade and value.\r\n\r\n778. OF THE NUMEROUS VARIETIES OF THE DOMESTICATED HOG, the following\r\nlist of breeds may be accepted as the best, presenting severally all\r\nthose qualities aimed at in the rearing of domestic stock, as affecting\r\nboth the breeder and the consumer. _Native_--Berkshire, Essex, York, and\r\nCumberland; _Foreign_--the Chinese. Before, however, proceeding with the\r\nconsideration of the different orders, in the series we have placed\r\nthem, it will be necessary to make a few remarks relative to the pig\r\ngenerally. In the first place, the _Black Pig_ is regarded by breeders\r\nas the best and most eligible animal, not only from the fineness and\r\ndelicacy of the skin, but because it is less affected by the heat in\r\nsummer, and far less subject to cuticular disease than either the white\r\nor brindled hog, but more particularly from its kindlier nature and\r\ngreater aptitude to fatten.\r\n\r\n779. THE GREAT QUALITY FIRST SOUGHT FOR IN A HOG is a capacious stomach,\r\nand next, a healthy power of digestion; for the greater the quantity he\r\ncan eat, and the more rapidly he can digest what he has eaten, the more\r\nquickly will he fatten; and the faster he can be made to increase in\r\nflesh, without a material increase of bone, the better is the breed\r\nconsidered, and the more valuable the animal. In the usual order of\r\nnature, the development of flesh and enlargement of bone proceed\r\ntogether; but here the object is to outstrip the growth of the bones by\r\nthe quicker development of their fleshy covering.\r\n\r\n780. THE CHIEF POINTS SOUGHT FOR IN THE CHOICE OF A HOG are breadth of\r\nchest, depth of carcase, width of loin, chine, and ribs, compactness of\r\nform, docility, cheerfulness, and general beauty of appearance. The head\r\nin a well-bred hog must not be too long, the forehead narrow and convex,\r\ncheeks full, snout fine, mouth small, eyes small and quick, ears short,\r\nthin, and sharp, pendulous, and pointing forwards; neck full and broad,\r\nparticularly on the top, where it should join very broad shoulders; the\r\nribs, loin, and haunch should be in a uniform line, and the tail well\r\nset, neither too high nor too low; at the same time the back is to be\r\nstraight or slightly curved, the chest deep, broad, and prominent, the\r\nlegs short and thick; the belly, when well fattened, should nearly touch\r\nthe ground, the hair be long, thin, fine, and having few bristles, and\r\nwhatever the colour, uniform, either white, black, or blue; but not\r\nspotted, speckled, brindled, or sandy. Such are the features and\r\nrequisites that, among breeders and judges, constitute the _beau idéal_\r\nof a perfect pig.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BERKSHIRE SOW.]\r\n\r\n781. THE BERKSHIRE PIG IS THE BEST KNOWN AND MOST ESTEEMED of all our\r\nEnglish domestic breeds, and so highly is it regarded, that even the\r\nvarieties of the stock are in as great estimation as the parent breed\r\nitself. The characteristics of the Berkshire hog are that it has a tawny\r\ncolour, spotted with black, large ears hanging over the eyes, a thick,\r\nclose, and well-made body, legs short and small in the bone; feeds up to\r\na great weight, fattens quickly, and is good either for pork or bacon.\r\nThe New or Improved Berkshire possesses all the above qualities, but is\r\ninfinitely more prone to fatten, while the objectionable colour has been\r\nentirely done away with, being now either all white or completely black.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESSEX SOW.]\r\n\r\n782. NEXT TO THE FORMER, THE ESSEX takes place in public estimation,\r\nalways competing, and often successfully, with the Berkshire. The\r\npeculiar characters of the Essex breed are that it is tip-eared, has a\r\nlong sharp head, is roach-backed, with a long flat body, standing high\r\non the legs; is rather bare of hair, is a quick feeder, has an enormous\r\ncapacity of stomach and belly, and an appetite to match its receiving\r\ncapability. Its colour is white, or else black and white, and it has a\r\nrestless habit and an unquiet disposition. The present valuable stock\r\nhas sprung from a cross between the common native animal and either the\r\nWhite Chinese or Black Neapolitan breeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YORKSHIRE SOW.]\r\n\r\n783. THE YORKSHIRE, CALLED ALSO THE OLD LINCOLNSHIRE, was at one time\r\nthe largest stock of the pig family in England, and perhaps, at that\r\ntime, the worst. It was long-legged, weak in the loins, with coarse\r\nwhite curly hair, and flabby flesh. Now, however, it has undergone as\r\ngreat a change as any breed in the kingdom, and by judicious crossing\r\nhas become the most valuable we possess, being a very well-formed pig\r\nthroughout, with a good head, a pleasant docile countenance, with\r\nmoderate-sized drooping ears, a broad back, slightly curved, large chine\r\nand loins, with deep sides, full chest, and well covered with long\r\nthickly-set white hairs. Besides these qualities of form, he is a quick\r\ngrower, feeds fast, and will easily make from 20 to 25 stone before\r\ncompleting his first year. The quality of the meat is also uncommonly\r\ngood, the fat and lean being laid on in almost equal proportions. So\r\ncapable is this species of development, both in flesh and stature, that\r\nexamples of the Yorkshire breed have been exhibited weighing as much as\r\na Scotch ox.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUMBERLAND SOW.]\r\n\r\n784. THOUGH ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY IN ENGLAND can boast some local variety\r\nor other of this useful animal, obtained from the native stock by\r\ncrossing with some of the foreign kinds, Cumberland and the north-west\r\nparts of the kingdom have been celebrated for a small breed of white\r\npigs, with a thick, compact, and well-made body, short in the legs, the\r\nhead and back well formed, ears slouching and a little downwards, and on\r\nthe whole, a hardy, profitable animal, and one well disposed to fatten.\r\n\r\n785. THERE IS NO VARIETY OF THIS USEFUL ANIMAL that presents such\r\npeculiar features as the species known to us as the Chinese pig; and as\r\nit is the general belief that to this animal and the Neapolitan hog we\r\nare indebted for that remarkable improvement which has taken place in\r\nthe breeds of the English pig, it is necessary to be minute in the\r\ndescription of this, in all respects, singular animal. The Chinese, in\r\nthe first place, consists of many varieties, and presents as many forms\r\nof body as differences of colour; the best kind, however, has a\r\nbeautiful white skin of singular thinness and delicacy; the hair too is\r\nperfectly white, and thinly set over the body, with here and there a few\r\nbristles. He has a broad snout, short head, eyes bright and fiery, very\r\nsmall fine pink ears, wide cheeks, high chine, with a neck of such\r\nimmense thickness, that when the animal is fat it looks like an\r\nelongated carcase,--a mass of fat, without shape or form, like a feather\r\npillow. The belly is dependent, and almost trailing on the ground, the\r\nlegs very short, and the tail so small as to be little more than a\r\nrudiment. It has a ravenous appetite, and will eat anything that the\r\nwonderful assimilating powers of its stomach can digest; and to that\r\ncapability, there seems no limit in the whole range of animal or\r\nvegetable nature. The consequence of this perfect and singularly rapid\r\ndigestion is an unprecedented proneness to obesity, a process of\r\nfattening that, once commenced, goes on with such rapid development,\r\nthat, in a short time, it loses all form, depositing such an amount of\r\nfat, that it in fact ceases to have any refuse part or offal, and,\r\nbeyond the hair on its back and the callous extremity of the snout, _the\r\nwhole carcase is eatable_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINESE SOW.]\r\n\r\n786. WHEN JUDICIOUSLY FED ON VEGETABLE DIET, and this obese tendency\r\nchecked, the flesh of the Chinese pig is extremely delicate and\r\ndelicious; but when left to gorge almost exclusively on animal food, it\r\nbecomes oily, coarse, and unpleasant. Perhaps there is no other instance\r\nin nature where the effect of rapid and perfect digestion is so well\r\nshown as in this animal, which thrives on _everything_, and turns to the\r\nbenefit of its physical economy, food of the most _opposite nature_, and\r\nof the most unwholesome and _offensive_ character. When fully fattened,\r\nthe thin cuticle, that is one of its characteristics, cracks, from the\r\nadipose distension beneath, exposing the fatty mass, which discharges a\r\nliquid oil from the adjacent tissues. The great fault in this breed is\r\nthe remarkably small quantity of lean laid down, to the immense\r\nproportion of fat. Some idea of the growth of this species may be\r\ninferred from the fact of their attaining to 18 stone before two years,\r\nand when further advanced, as much as 40 stone. In its pure state,\r\nexcept for roasters, the Chinese pig is too disproportionate for the\r\nEnglish market; but when crossed with some of our lean stock, the breed\r\nbecomes almost invaluable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTPHALIAN BOAR.]\r\n\r\n787. THE WILD BOAR is a much more cleanly and sagacious animal than the\r\ndomesticated hog; he is longer in the snout, has his ears shorter and\r\nhis tusks considerably longer, very frequently measuring as much as 10\r\ninches. They are extremely sharp, and are bent in an upward circle.\r\nUnlike his domestic brother, who roots up here and there, or wherever\r\nhis fancy takes, the wild boar ploughs the ground in continuous lines or\r\nfurrows. The boar, when selected as the parent of a stock, should have a\r\nsmall head, be deep and broad in the chest; the chine should be arched,\r\nthe ribs and barrel well rounded, with the haunches falling full down\r\nnearly to the hock; and he should always be more compact and smaller\r\nthan the female. The colour of the wild boar is always of a uniform hue,\r\nand generally of an iron grey; shading off into a black. The hair of the\r\nboar is of considerable length, especially about the head and mane; he\r\nstands, in general, from 20 to 30 inches in height at the shoulders,\r\nthough instances have occurred where he has reached 42 inches. The young\r\nare of a pale yellowish tint, irregularly brindled with light brown. The\r\nboar of Germany is a large and formidable animal, and the hunting of\r\nhim, with a small species of mastiff, is still a national sport. From\r\nliving almost exclusively on acorns and nuts, his flesh is held in great\r\nesteem, and in Westphalia his legs are made into hams by a process\r\nwhich, it is said, enhances the flavour and quality of the meat in a\r\nremarkable degree.\r\n\r\n788. THERE ARE TWO POINTS to be taken into consideration by all breeders\r\nof pigs--to what ultimate use is the flesh to be put; for, if meant to\r\nbe eaten fresh, or simply salted, the _small_ breed of pigs is host\r\nsuited for the purpose; if for hams or bacon, the large variety of the\r\nanimal is necessary. Pigs are usually weaned between six and eight weeks\r\nafter birth, after which they are fed on soft food, such as mashed\r\npotatoes in skimmed or butter-milk. The general period at which the\r\nsmall hogs are killed for the market is from 12 to 16 weeks; from 4 to 5\r\nmouths, they are called store pigs, and are turned out to graze till the\r\nanimal has acquired its full stature. As soon as this point has been\r\nreached, the pig should be forced to maturity as quickly as possible; he\r\nshould therefore be taken from the fields and farm-yard, and shut up on\r\nboiled potatoes, buttermilk, and peas-meal, after a time to be followed\r\nby grains, oil-cake, wash, barley, and Indian meal; supplying his sty at\r\nthe same time with plenty of water, cinders, and a quantity of salt in\r\nevery mess of food presented to him.\r\n\r\n789. THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF PIGS IN GREAT BRITAIN is supposed to exceed\r\n20 millions; and, considering the third of the number as worth £2\r\napiece, and the remaining two-thirds as of the relative value of _10s_.\r\neach, would give a marketable estimate of over £20,000,000 for this\r\nanimal alone.\r\n\r\n790. THE BEST AND MOST HUMANE MODE OF KILLING ALL LARGE HOGS is to\r\nstrike them down like a bullock, with the pointed end of a poleaxe, on\r\nthe forehead, which has the effect of killing the animal at once; all\r\nthe butcher has then to do, is to open the aorta and great arteries, and\r\nlaying the animal's neck over a trough, let out the blood as quickly as\r\npossible. The carcase is then to be scalded, either on a board or by\r\nimmersion in a tub of very hot water, and all the hair and dirt rapidly\r\nscraped off, till the skin is made perfectly white, when it is hung up,\r\nopened, and dressed, as it is called, in the usual way. It is then\r\nallowed to cool, a sheet being thrown around the carcase, to prevent the\r\nair from discolouring the newly-cleaned skin. When meant for bacon, the\r\nhair is singed instead of being scalded off.\r\n\r\n791. IN THE COUNTRY, where for ordinary consumption the pork killed for\r\nsale is usually both larger and fatter than that supplied to the London\r\nconsumer, it is customary to remove the skin and fat down to the lean,\r\nand, salting that, roast what remains of the joint. Pork goes further,\r\nand is consequently a more economical food than other meats, simply\r\nbecause the texture is closer, and there is less waste in the cooking,\r\neither in roasting or boiling.\r\n\r\n792. IN FRESH PORK, the leg is the most economical family joint, and the\r\nloin the richest.\r\n\r\n793. COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING, very little difference exists between the\r\nweight of the live and dead pig, and this, simply because there is\r\nneither the head nor the hide to be removed. It has been proved that\r\npork loses in cooking 13-1/2, per cent. of its weight. A salted hand\r\nweighing 4 lbs. 5 oz. lost in the cooking 11 oz.; after cooking, the\r\nmeat weighing only 3 lbs. 1 oz., and the bone 9 oz. The original cost\r\nwas 7-1/2d. a pound; but by this deduction, the cost rose to 9d. per\r\npound with the bone, and 10-1/4d. without it.\r\n\r\n794. PORK, TO BE PRESERVED, is cured in several ways,--either by\r\ncovering it with salt, or immersing it in ready-made brine, where it is\r\nkept till required; or it is only partially salted, and then hung up to\r\ndry, when the meat is called white bacon; or, after salting, it is hung\r\nin wood smoke till the flesh is impregnated with the aroma from the\r\nwood. The Wiltshire bacon, which is regarded as the finest in the\r\nkingdom, is prepared by laying the sides of a hog in large wooden\r\ntroughs, and then rubbing into the flesh quantities of powdered\r\nbay-salt, made hot in a frying-pan. This process is repeated for four\r\ndays; they are then left for three weeks, merely turning the flitches\r\nevery other day. After that time they are hung up to dry. The hogs\r\nusually killed for purposes of bacon in England average from 18 to 20\r\nstone; on the other hand, the hogs killed in the country for farm-house\r\npurposes, seldom weigh less than 26 stone. The legs of boars, hogs, and,\r\nin Germany, those of bears, are prepared differently, and called hams.\r\n\r\n795. THE PRACTICE IN VOGUE FORMERLY in this country was to cut out the\r\nhams and cure them separately; then to remove the ribs, which were\r\nroasted as \"spare-ribs,\" and, curing the remainder of the side, call it\r\na \"gammon of bacon.\"\r\n\r\nSmall pork to cut for table in joints, is cut up, in most places\r\nthroughout the kingdom, as represented in the engraving. The sale is\r\ndivided with nine ribs to the fore quarter; and the following is an\r\nenumeration of the joints in the two respective quarters:--\r\n\r\n                 1. The leg.\r\n  HIND QUARTER   2. The loin.\r\n                 3. The spring, or belly.\r\n\r\n                 4. The hand.\r\n  FORE QUARTER   5. The fore-loin.\r\n                 6. The cheek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE OF A PIG, SHOWING THE SEVERAL JOINTS.]\r\n\r\nThe weight of the several joints of a good pork pig of four stone may be\r\nas follows; viz.:--\r\n\r\n  The leg                        8 lbs.\r\n  The loin and spring            7 lbs.\r\n  The hand                       6 lbs.\r\n  The chine                      7 lbs.\r\n  The cheek            from 2 to 3 lbs.\r\n\r\nOf a bacon pig, the legs are reserved for curing, and when cured are\r\ncalled hams: when the meat is separated from the shoulder-blade and\r\nbones and cured, it is called bacon. The bones, with part of the meat\r\nleft on them, are divided into spare-ribs, griskins, and chines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK CUTLETS (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n796. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast loin of pork, 1 oz. of\r\nbutter, 2 onions, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1/2 pint of gravy, pepper\r\nand salt to taste, 1 teaspoonful of vinegar and mustard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the pork into nice-sized cutlets, trim off most of the fat,\r\nand chop the onions. Put the butter into a stewpan, lay in the cutlets\r\nand chopped onions, and fry a light brown; then add the remaining\r\ningredients, simmer gently for 5 or 7 minutes, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 to 7 minutes. _Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March.\r\n\r\n    AUSTRIAN METHOD OF HERDING PIGS.--In the Austrian empire there\r\n    are great numbers of wild swine, while, among the wandering\r\n    tribes peopling the interior of Hungary, and spreading over the\r\n    vast steppes of that country, droves of swine form a great\r\n    portion of the wealth of the people, who chiefly live on a\r\n    coarse bread and wind-dried bacon.\r\n\r\n    In German Switzerland, the Tyrol, and other mountainous\r\n    districts of continental Europe, though the inhabitants, almost\r\n    everywhere, as in England, keep one or more pigs, they are at\r\n    little or no trouble in feeding them, one or more men being\r\n    employed by one or several villages as swine-herds; who, at a\r\n    certain hour, every morning, call for the pig or pigs, and\r\n    driving them to their feeding-grounds on the mountain-side and\r\n    in the wood, take custody of the herd till, on the approach of\r\n    night, they are collected into a compact body and driven home\r\n    for a night's repose in their several sties.\r\n\r\n    The amount of intelligence and docility displayed by the pigs in\r\n    these mountain regions, is much more considerable than that\r\n    usually allowed to this animal, and the manner in which these\r\n    immense herds of swine are collected, and again distributed,\r\n    without an accident or mistake, is a sight both curious and\r\n    interesting; for it is all done without the assistance of a dog,\r\n    or the aid even of the human voice, and solely by the crack of\r\n    the long-lashed and heavily-loaded whip, which the swine-herd\r\n    carries, and cracks much after the fashion of the French\r\n    postilion; and which, though he frequently cracks, waking a\r\n    hundred sharp echoes from the woods and rocks, he seldom has to\r\n    use correctionally; the animal soon acquiring a thorough\r\n    knowledge of the meaning of each crack; and once having felt its\r\n    leaded thong, a lasting remembrance of its power. At early dawn,\r\n    the swine-herd takes his stand at the outskirts of the first\r\n    village, and begins flourishing through the misty air his\r\n    immensely long lash, keeping a sort of rude time with the crack,\r\n    crack, crack, crack, crack, crack of his whip. The nearest pigs,\r\n    hearing the well-remembered sound, rouse from their straw, and\r\n    rush from their sties into the road, followed by all their\r\n    litters. As soon as a sufficient number are collected, the drove\r\n    is set in motion, receiving, right and left, as they advance,\r\n    fresh numbers; whole communities, or solitary individuals,\r\n    streaming in from all quarters, and taking their place, without\r\n    distinction, in the general herd; and, as if conscious where\r\n    their breakfast lay, without wasting a moment on idle\r\n    investigation, all eagerly push on to the mountains. In this\r\n    manner village after village is collected, till the drove not\r\n    unfrequently consists of several thousands. The feeding-ground\r\n    has, of course, often to be changed, and the drove have\r\n    sometimes to be driven many miles, and to a considerable height\r\n    up the mountain, before the whip gives the signal for the\r\n    dispersion of the body and the order to feed, when the herdsman\r\n    proceeds to form himself a shelter, and look after his own\r\n    comfort for the rest of the day. As soon as twilight sets in,\r\n    the whip is again heard echoing the signal for muster; and in\r\n    the same order in which they were collected, the swine are\r\n    driven back, each group tailing off to its respective sty, as\r\n    the herd approaches the villages, till the last grunter, having\r\n    found his home, the drover seeks his cottage and repose.\r\n\r\nPORK CUTLETS OR CHOPS.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n797. INGREDIENTS.--Loin of pork, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the cutlets from a delicate loin of pork, bone and trim\r\nthem neatly, and cut away the greater portion of the fat. Season them\r\nwith pepper; place the gridiron on the fire; when quite hot, lay on the\r\nchops and broil them for about 1/4 hour, turning them 3 or 4 times; and\r\nbe particular that they are _thoroughly_ done, but not dry. Dish them,\r\nsprinkle over a little fine salt, and serve plain, or with tomato sauce,\r\nsauce piquante, or pickled gherkins, a few of which should be laid round\r\nthe dish as a garnish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/4 hour. _Average cost_, 10d. per lb. for chops.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 6 for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n(_Another Way_.)\r\n\r\n798. INGREDIENTS.--Loin or fore-loin, of pork, egg and bread crumbs,\r\nsalt and pepper to taste; to every tablespoonful of bread crumbs allow\r\n1/2 teaspoonful of minced sage; clarified butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the cutlets from a loin, or fore-loin, of pork; trim them\r\nthe same as mutton cutlets, and scrape the top part of the bone. Brush\r\nthem over with egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs, with which have been\r\nmixed minced sage and a seasoning of pepper and salt; drop a little\r\nclarified butter on them, and press the crumbs well down. Put the\r\nfrying-pan on the fire, put in some lard; when this is hot, lay in the\r\ncutlets, and fry them a light brown on both sides. Take them out, put\r\nthem before the fire to dry the greasy moisture from them, and dish them\r\non mashed potatoes. Serve with them any sauce that may be preferred;\r\nsuch as tomato sauce, sauce piquante, sauce Robert, or pickled gherkins.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 15 to 20 minutes. _Average cost_, 10d. per lb. for chops.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 6 cutlets for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The remains of roast loin of pork may be dressed in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK CHEESE (an Excellent Breakfast Dish).\r\n\r\n799. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of cold roast pork, pepper and salt to taste,\r\n1 dessertspoonful of minced parsley, 4 leaves of sage, a very small\r\nbunch of savoury herbs, 2 blades of pounded mace, a little nutmeg, 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of minced lemon-peel; good strong gravy, sufficient to fill\r\nthe mould.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut, but do not chop, the pork into fine pieces, and allow 1/4\r\nlb. of fat to each pound of lean. Season with pepper and salt; pound\r\nwell the spices, and chop finely the parsley, sage, herbs, and\r\nlemon-peel, and mix the whole nicely together. Put it into a mould, fill\r\nup with good strong well-flavoured gravy, and bake rather more than one\r\nhour. When cold, turn it out of the mould.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST LEG OF PORK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST LEG OF PORK.]\r\n\r\n800. INGREDIENTS.--Leg of pork, a little oil for stuffing. (See Recipe\r\nNo. 504.)\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose a small leg of pork, and score the skin across in narrow\r\nstrips, about 1/4 inch apart. Cut a slit in the knuckle, loosen the\r\nskin, and fill it with a sage-and-onion stuffing, made by Recipe No.\r\n504. Brush the joint over with a little salad-oil (this makes the\r\ncrackling crisper, and a better colour), and put it down to a bright,\r\nclear fire, not too near, as that would cause the skin to blister. Baste\r\nit well, and serve with a little gravy made in the dripping-pan, and do\r\nnot omit to send to table with it a tureen of well-made apple-sauce.\r\n(Sec No. 363.)\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A leg of pork weighing 8 lbs., about 3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n    ENGLISH MODE OF HUNTING, AND INDIAN PIG-STICKING.--The hunting\r\n    of the wild boar has been in all times, and in all countries, a\r\n    pastime of the highest interest and excitement, and from the age\r\n    of Nimrod, has only been considered second to the more dangerous\r\n    sport of lion-hunting. The buried treasures of Nineveh, restored\r\n    to us by Mr. Layard, show us, on their sculptured annals, the\r\n    kings of Assyria in their royal pastime of boar-hunting. That\r\n    the Greeks were passionately attached to this sport, we know\r\n    both from history and the romantic fables of the poets. Marc\r\n    Antony, at one of his breakfasts with Cleopatra, had _eight wild\r\n    boars_ roasted whole; and though the Romans do not appear to\r\n    have been addicted to hunting, wild-boar fights formed part of\r\n    their gladiatorial shows in the amphitheatre. In France,\r\n    Germany, and Britain, from the earliest time, the boar-hunt\r\n    formed one of the most exciting of sports; but it was only in\r\n    this country that the sport was conducted without dogs,--a real\r\n    hand-to-hand contest of man and beast; the hunter, armed only\r\n    with a boar-spear, a weapon about four feet long, the ash staff,\r\n    guarded by plates of steel, and terminating in a long, narrow,\r\n    and very sharp blade: this, with a hunting-knife, or hanger,\r\n    completed his offensive arms. Thus equipped, the hunter would\r\n    either encounter his enemy face to face, confront his desperate\r\n    charge, as with erect tail, depressed head, and flaming eyes, he\r\n    rushed with his foamy tusks full against him, who either sought\r\n    to pierce his vitals through his counter, or driving his spear\r\n    through his chine, transfix his heart; or failing those more\r\n    difficult aims, plunge it into his flank, and, without\r\n    withdrawing the weapon, strike his ready hanger into his throat.\r\n    But expert as the hunter might be, it was not often the\r\n    formidable brute was so quickly dispatched; for he would\r\n    sometimes seize the spear in his powerful teeth, and nip it off\r\n    like a reed, or, coming full tilt on his enemy, by his momentum\r\n    and weight bear him to the earth, ripping up, with a horrid\r\n    gash, his leg or side, and before the writhing hunter could draw\r\n    his knife, the infuriated beast would plunge his snout in the\r\n    wound, and rip, with savage teeth, the bowels of his victim. At\r\n    other times, he would suddenly swerve from his charge, and\r\n    doubling on his opponent, attack the hunter in the rear. From\r\n    his speed, great weight, and savage disposition, the wild boar\r\n    is always a dangerous antagonist, and requires great courage,\r\n    coolness, and agility on the part of the hunter. The continental\r\n    sportsman rides to the chase in a cavalcade, with music and\r\n    dogs,--a kind of small hound or mastiff, and leaving all the\r\n    honorary part of the contest to them, when the boar is becoming\r\n    weary, and while beset by the dogs, rides up, and drives his\r\n    lance home in the beast's back or side. Boar-hunting has been\r\n    for some centuries obsolete in England, the animal no longer\r\n    existing in a wild state among us; but in our Indian empire, and\r\n    especially in Bengal, the pastime is pursued by our countrymen\r\n    with all the daring of the national character; and as the animal\r\n    which inhabits the cane-brakes and jungles is a formidable foe,\r\n    the sport is attended with great excitement. The hunters,\r\n    mounted on small, active horses, and armed only with long\r\n    lances, ride, at early daylight, to the skirts of the jungle,\r\n    and having sent in their attendants to beat the cover, wait till\r\n    the tusked monster comes crashing from among the canes, when\r\n    chase is immediately given, till he is come up with, and\r\n    transfixed by the first weapon. Instead of flight, however, he\r\n    often turns to bay, and by more than one dead horse and wounded\r\n    hunter, shows how formidable he is, and what those polished\r\n    tusks, sharp as pitch-forks, can effect, when the enraged animal\r\n    defends his life.\r\n\r\nTO GLAZE HAM.--(See Recipe No. 430.)\r\n\r\nHASHED PORK.\r\n\r\n801. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast pork, 2 onions, 1\r\nteaspoonful of flour, 2 blades of pounded mace, 2 cloves, 1\r\ntablespoonful of vinegar, 1/2 pint of gravy, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the onions and fry them of a nice brown, cut the pork into\r\nthin slices, season them with pepper and salt, and add these to the\r\nremaining ingredients. Stew gently for about 1/2 hour, and serve\r\ngarnished with sippets of toasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 3d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED RASHERS OF BACON AND POACHED EGGS.\r\n\r\n802. INGREDIENTS.--Bacon; eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the bacon into thin slices, trim away the rusty parts, and\r\ncut off the rind. Put it into a cold frying-pan, that is to say, do not\r\nplace the pan on the fire before the bacon is in it. Turn it 2 or 3\r\ntimes, and dish it on a very hot dish. Poach the eggs and slip them on\r\nto the bacon, without breaking the yolks, and serve quickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 or 4 minutes. _Average cost_, 10d. to 1s. per lb. for the\r\nprimest parts.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 6 eggs for 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Fried rashers of bacon, curled, serve as a pretty garnish to\r\nmany dishes; and, for small families, answer very well as a substitute\r\nfor boiled bacon, to serve with a small dish of poultry, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED RASHERS OF BACON (a Breakfast Dish).\r\n\r\n803. Before purchasing bacon, ascertain that it is perfectly free from\r\nrust, which may easily be detected by its yellow colour; and for\r\nbroiling, the streaked part of the thick flank, is generally the most\r\nesteemed. Cut it into _thin_ slices, take off the rind, and broil over a\r\nnice clear fire; turn it 2 or 3 times, and serve very hot. Should there\r\nbe any cold bacon left from the previous day, it answers very well for\r\nbreakfast, cut into slices, and broiled or fried.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 or 4 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. to 1s. per lb. for the primest parts.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--When the bacon is cut very thin, the slices may be curled round\r\nand fastened by means of small skewers, and fried or toasted before the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED BACON.\r\n\r\n804. INGREDIENTS.--Bacon; water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILED BACON.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--As bacon is frequently excessively salt, let it be soaked in\r\nwarm water for an hour or two previous to dressing it; then pare off the\r\nrusty parts, and scrape the under-side and rind as clean as possible.\r\nPut it into a saucepan of _cold_ water, let it come gradually to a boil,\r\nand as fast as the scum rises to the surface of the water, remove it.\r\nLet it simmer very gently until it is _thoroughly_ done; then take it\r\nup, strip off the skin, and sprinkle over the bacon a few bread\r\nraspings, and garnish with tufts of cauliflower or Brussels sprouts.\r\nWhen served alone, young and tender broad beans or green peas are the\r\nusual accompaniments.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 lb. of bacon, 1/4 hour; 2 lbs., 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. to 1s. per lb. for the primest parts.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--2 lbs., when served with poultry or veal, sufficient for\r\n10 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CURE BACON IN THE WILTSHIRE WAY.\r\n\r\n805. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of coarse sugar, 1-1/2 lb. of bay-salt, 6\r\noz. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of common salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Sprinkle each flitch with salt, and let the blood drain off for\r\n24 hours; then pound and mix the above ingredients well together and rub\r\nit well into the meat, which should be turned every day for a month;\r\nthen hang it to dry, and afterwards smoke it for 10 days.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To remain in the pickle 1 month, to be smoked 10 days.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--The above quantity of salt for 1 pig.\r\n\r\n    HOW PIGS WERE FORMERLY PASTURED AND FED.--Though unquestionably\r\n    far greater numbers of swine are now kept in England than\r\n    formerly, every peasant having one or more of that useful\r\n    animal, in feudal times immense droves of pigs were kept by the\r\n    franklings and barons; in those days the swine-herds being a\r\n    regular part of the domestic service of every feudal household,\r\n    their duty consisted in daily driving the herd of swine from the\r\n    castle-yard, or outlying farm, to the nearest woods, chase, or\r\n    forest, where the frankling or vavasour had, either by right or\r\n    grant, what was called _free warren_, or the liberty to feed his\r\n    hogs off the acorns, beech, and chestnuts that lay in such\r\n    abundance on the earth, and far exceeded the power of the royal\r\n    or privileged game to consume. Indeed, it was the license\r\n    granted the nobles of free warren, especially for their swine,\r\n    that kept up the iniquitous forest laws to so late a date, and\r\n    covered so large a portion of the land with such immense tracts\r\n    of wood and brake, to the injury of agriculture and the misery\r\n    of the people. Some idea of the extent to which swine were\r\n    grazed in the feudal times, may be formed by observing the\r\n    number of pigs still fed in Epping Forest, the Forest of Dean,\r\n    and the New Forest, in Hampshire, where, for several months of\r\n    the year, the beech-nuts and acorns yield them so plentiful a\r\n    diet. In Germany, where the chestnut is so largely cultivated,\r\n    the amount of food shed every autumn is enormous; and\r\n    consequently the pig, both wild and domestic, has, for a\r\n    considerable portion of the year, an unfailing supply of\r\n    admirable nourishment. Impressed with the value of this fruit\r\n    for the food of pigs, the Prince Consort has, with great\r\n    judgment, of late encouraged the collection of chestnuts in\r\n    Windsor Park, and by giving a small reward to old people and\r\n    children for every bushel collected, has not only found an\r\n    occupation for many of the unemployed poor, but, by providing a\r\n    gratuitous food for their pig, encouraged a feeling of\r\n    providence and economy.\r\n\r\nFOR CURING BACON, AND KEEPING IT FREE FROM RUST (Cobbett's Recipe).\r\n\r\n806. THE TWO SIDES THAT REMAIN, and which are called flitches, are to be\r\ncured for bacon. They are first rubbed with salt on their insides, or\r\nflesh sides, then placed one on the other, the flesh sides uppermost, in\r\na salting-trough which has a gutter round its edges to drain away the\r\nbrine; for, to have sweet and fine bacon, the flitches must not be\r\nsopping in brine, which gives it the sort of vile taste that barrel and\r\nsea pork have. Every one knows how different is the taste of fresh dry\r\nsalt from that of salt in a dissolved state; therefore change the salt\r\noften,--once in 4 or 5 days; let it melt and sink in, but not lie too\r\nlong; twice change the flitches, put that at bottom which was first on\r\nthe top: this mode will cost you a great deal more in salt than the\r\nsopping mode, but without it your bacon will not be so sweet and fine,\r\nnor keep so well. As for the time required in making your flitches\r\nsufficiently salt, it depends on circumstances. It takes a longer time\r\nfor a thick than a thin flitch, and longer in dry than in damp weather,\r\nor in a dry than in a damp place; but for the flitches of a hog of five\r\nscore, in weather not very dry or damp, about 6 weeks may do; and as\r\nyours is to be fat, which receives little injury from over-salting, give\r\ntime enough, for you are to have bacon until Christmas comes again.\r\n\r\n807. THE PLACE FOR SALTING SHOULD, like a dairy, always be cool, but\r\nwell ventilated; confined air, though cool, will taint meat sooner than\r\nthe midday day sun accompanied by a breeze. With regard to smoking the\r\nbacon, two precautions are necessary: first, to hang the flitches where\r\nno rain comes down upon them; and next, that the smoke must proceed from\r\nwood, not peat, turf, or coal. As to the time required to smoke a\r\nflitch, it depends a good deal upon whether there be a constant fire\r\nbeneath; and whether the fire be large or small: a month will do, if the\r\nfire be pretty constant and rich, as a farmhouse fire usually is; but\r\nover-smoking, or rather too long hanging in the air, makes the bacon\r\nrust; great attention should therefore be paid to this matter. The\r\nflitch ought not to be dried up to the hardness of a board, and yet it\r\nought to be perfectly dry. Before you hang it up, lay it on the floor,\r\nscatter the flesh side pretty thickly over with bran, or with some fine\r\nsawdust, not of deal or fir; rub it on the flesh, or pat it well down\r\nupon it: this keeps the smoke from getting into the little openings, and\r\nmakes a sort of crust to be dried on.\r\n\r\n808. To KEEP THE BACON SWEET AND GOOD, and free from hoppers, sift fine\r\nsome clean and dry wood ashes. Put some at the bottom of a box or chest\r\nlong enough to hold a flitch of bacon; lay in one flitch, and then put\r\nin more ashes, then another flitch, and cover this with six or eight\r\ninches of the ashes. The place where the box or chest is kept ought to\r\nbe dry, and should the ashes become damp, they should be put in the\r\nfireplace to dry, and when cold, put back again. With these precautions,\r\nthe bacon will be as good at the end of the year as on the first day.\r\n\r\n809. FOR SIMPLE GENERAL RULES; these may be safely taken as a guide; and\r\nthose who implicitly follow the directions given, will possess at the\r\nexpiration of from 6 weeks to 2 months well-flavoured and well-cured\r\nbacon.\r\n\r\n    HOG NOT BACON. ANECDOTE OF LORD BACON.--As Lord Bacon, on one\r\n    occasion, was about to pass sentence of death upon a man of the\r\n    name of Hogg, who had just been tried for a long career of\r\n    crime, the prisoner suddenly claimed to be heard in arrest of\r\n    judgment, saying, with an expression of arch confidence as he\r\n    addressed the bench, \"I claim indulgence, my lord, on the plea\r\n    of relationship; for I am convinced your lordship will never be\r\n    unnatural enough to hang one of your own family.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Indeed, replied the judge, with some amazement,\" I was not\r\n    aware that I had the honour of your alliance; perhaps you will\r\n    be good enough to name the degree of our mutual affinity.\"\r\n\r\n    \"I am sorry, my lord,\" returned the impudent thief, \"I cannot\r\n    trace the links of consanguinity; but the moral evidence is\r\n    sufficiently pertinent. My name, my lord, is Hogg, your\r\n    lordship's is Bacon; and all the world will allow that bacon and\r\n    hog are very closely allied.\"\r\n\r\n    \"I am sorry,\" replied his lordship, \"I cannot admit the truth of\r\n    your instance: hog cannot be bacon till it is hanged; and so,\r\n    before I can admit your plea, or acknowledge the family compact,\r\n    Hogg must be hanged to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nTO BAKE A HAM.\r\n\r\n810. INGREDIENTS.--Ham; a common crust.\r\n\r\nMode.--As a ham for baking should be well soaked, let it remain in water\r\nfor at least 12 hours. Wipe it dry, trim away any rusty places\r\nunderneath, and cover it with a common crust, taking care that this is\r\nof sufficient thickness all over to keep the gravy in. Place it in a\r\nmoderately-heated oven, and bake for nearly 4 hours. Take off the crust,\r\nand skin, and cover with raspings, the same as for boiled ham, and\r\ngarnish the knuckle with a paper frill. This method of cooking a ham is,\r\nby many persons, considered far superior to boiling it, as it cuts\r\nfuller of gravy and has a finer flavour, besides keeping a much longer\r\ntime good.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A medium-sized ham, 4 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 8d. to 10d. per lb. by the whole ham.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BOIL A HAM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILED HAM.]\r\n\r\n811. INGREDIENTS.--Ham, water, glaze or raspings.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--In choosing a ham, ascertain that it is perfectly sweet, by\r\nrunning a sharp knife into it, close to the bone; and if, when the knife\r\nis withdrawn, it has an agreeable smell, the ham is good; if, on the\r\ncontrary, the blade has a greasy appearance and offensive smell, the ham\r\nis bad. If it has been long hung, and is very dry and salt, let it\r\nremain in soak for 24 hours, changing the water frequently. This length\r\nof time is only necessary in the case of its being very hard; from 8 to\r\n12 hours would be sufficient for a Yorkshire or Westmoreland ham. Wash\r\nit thoroughly clean, and trim away from the under-side, all the rusty\r\nand smoked parts, which would spoil the appearance. Put it into a\r\nboiling-pot, with sufficient cold water to cover it; bring it gradually\r\nto boil, and as the scum rises, carefully remove it. Keep it simmering\r\nvery gently until tender, and be careful that it does not stop boiling,\r\nnor boil too quickly. When done, take it out of the pot, strip off the\r\nskin, and sprinkle over it a few fine bread-raspings, put a frill of cut\r\npaper round the knuckle, and serve. If to be eaten cold, let the ham\r\nremain in the water until nearly cold: by this method the juices are\r\nkept in, and it will be found infinitely superior to one taken out of\r\nthe water hot; it should, however, be borne in mind that the ham must\r\n_not_ remain in the saucepan _all_ night. When the skin is removed,\r\nsprinkle over bread-raspings, or, if wanted particularly nice, glaze it.\r\nPlace a paper frill round the knuckle, and garnish with parsley or cut\r\nvegetable flowers. (_See_ Coloured Plate P.)\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A ham weighing 10 lbs., 4 hours to _simmer gently_; 15 lbs., 5\r\nhours; a very large one, about 5 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 8d. to 10d. per lb. by the whole ham.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO BOIL A HAM TO GIVE IT AN EXCELLENT FLAVOUR.\r\n\r\n812. INGREDIENTS.--Vinegar and water, 2 heads of celery, 2 turnips, 3\r\nonions, a large bunch of savoury herbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Prepare the ham as in the preceding recipe, and let it soak for\r\na few hours in vinegar and water. Put it on in cold water, and when it\r\nboils, add the vegetables and herbs. Simmer very gently until tender,\r\ntake it out, strip off the skin, cover with bread-raspings, and put a\r\npaper ruche or frill round the knuckle.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A ham weighing 10 lbs., 4 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d. to 10d. per lb. by the whole ham.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    HOW TO SILENCE A PIG. ANECDOTE OF CHARLES V.--When the emperor\r\n    Charles V. was one day walking in the neighbourhood of Vienna,\r\n    full of pious considerations, engendered by the thoughts of the\r\n    Dominican cloister he was about to visit, he was much annoyed by\r\n    the noise of a pig, which a country youth was carrying a little\r\n    way before him. At length, irritated by the unmitigated noise,\r\n    \"Have you not learned how to quiet a pig\" demanded the imperial\r\n    traveller, tartly. \"Noa,\" replied the ingenuous peasant,\r\n    ignorant of the quality of his interrogator;--\"noa; and I should\r\n    very much like to know how to do it,\" changing the position of\r\n    his burthen, and giving his load a surreptitious pinch of the\r\n    ear, which immediately altered the tone and volume of his\r\n    complaining.\r\n\r\n    \"Why, take the pig by the tail,\" said the emperor, \"and you will\r\n    see how quiet he will become.\"\r\n\r\n    Struck by the novelty of the suggestion, the countryman at once\r\n    dangled his noisy companion by the tail, and soon discovered\r\n    that, under the partial congestion caused by its inverted\r\n    position, the pig had indeed become silent; when, looking with\r\n    admiration on his august adviser, he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n    \"Ah, you must have learned the trade much longer than I, for you\r\n    understand it a great deal better.\"\r\n\r\nFRIED HAM AND EGGS (a Breakfast Dish).\r\n\r\n813. INGREDIENTS.--Ham; eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the ham into slices, and take care that they are of the\r\nsame thickness in every part. Cut off the rind, and if the ham should be\r\nparticularly hard and salt, it will be found an improvement to soak it\r\nfor about 10 minutes in hot water, and then dry it in a cloth. Put it\r\ninto a cold frying-pan, set it over the fire, and turn the slices 3 or 4\r\ntimes whilst they are cooking. When done, place them on a dish, which\r\nshould be kept hot in front of the fire during the time the eggs are\r\nbeing poached. Poach the eggs, slip them on to the slices of ham, and\r\nserve quickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--7 or 8 minutes to broil the ham.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 8d. to 10d. per lb. by the whole ham.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Ham may also be toasted or broiled; but, with the latter\r\nmethod, to insure its being well cooked, the fire must be beautifully\r\nclear, or it will have a smoky flavour far from agreeable.\r\n\r\nPOTTED HAM, that will keep Good for some time.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n814. INGREDIENTS.--To 4 lbs. of lean ham allow 1 lb. of fat, 2\r\nteaspoonfuls of pounded mace, 1/2 nutmeg grated, rather more than 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of cayenne, clarified lard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mince the ham, fat and lean together in the above proportion,\r\nand pound it well in a mortar, seasoning it with cayenne pepper, pounded\r\nmace, and nutmeg; put the mixture into a deep baking-dish, and bake for\r\n1/2 hour; then press it well into a stone jar, fill up the jar with\r\nclarified lard, cover it closely, and paste over it a piece of thick\r\npaper. If well seasoned, it will keep a long time in winter, and will be\r\nfound very convenient for sandwiches, &c.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n(_A nice addition to the Breakfast or Luncheon table_.)\r\n\r\n815. INGREDIENTS.--To 2 lbs. of lean ham allow 1/2 lb. of fat, 1\r\nteaspoonful of pounded mace, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded allspice, 1/2\r\nnutmeg, pepper to taste, clarified butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut some slices from the remains of a cold ham, mince them\r\nsmall, and to every 2 lbs. of lean, allow the above proportion of fat.\r\nPound the ham in a mortar to a fine paste, with the fat, gradually add\r\nthe seasoning and spices, and be very particular that all the\r\ningredients are well mixed and the spices well pounded. Press the\r\nmixture into potting-pots, pour over clarified butter, and keep it in a\r\ncool place.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    IMPORTANCE OF THE BOAR'S HEAD, SCOTTISH FEUDS, &c.--The boar's\r\n    head, in ancient times, formed the most important dish on the\r\n    table, and was invariably the first placed on the board upon\r\n    Christmas-day, being preceded by a body of servitors, a flourish\r\n    of trumpets, and other marks of distinction and reverence, and\r\n    carried into the hall by the individual of next rank to the lord\r\n    of the feast. At some of our colleges and inns of court, the\r\n    serving of the boar's head on a silver platter on Christmas-day\r\n    is a custom still followed; and till very lately, a bore's head\r\n    was competed for at Christmas time by the young men of a rural\r\n    parish in Essex. Indeed, so highly was the grizzly boar's head\r\n    regarded in former times, that it passed into a cognizance of\r\n    some of the noblest families in the realm: thus it was not only\r\n    the crest of the Nevills and Warwicks, with their collateral\r\n    houses, but it was the cognizance of Richard III., that--\r\n\r\n      \"Wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,\r\n       That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,\r\n       Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough\r\n       In your embowell'd bosoms,\"--\r\n\r\n    and whose nature it was supposed to typify; and was universally\r\n    used as a _sign_ to taverns. The Boar's Head in Eastcheap,\r\n    which, till within the last twenty-five years still stood in all\r\n    its primitive quaintness, though removed to make way for the\r\n    London-bridge approaches, will live vividly in the mind of every\r\n    reader of Shakspeare, as the resort of the prince of Wales,\r\n    Poins, and his companions, and the residence of Falstaff and his\r\n    coney-catching knaves, Bardolph, Pistol, and Nym; and whose sign\r\n    was a boar's head, carved in stone over the door, and a smaller\r\n    one in wood on each side of the doorway.\r\n\r\n    The traditions and deeds of savage vengeance recorded in\r\n    connection with this grim trophy of the chase are numerous in\r\n    all parts of Europe. But the most remarkable connected with the\r\n    subject in this country, were two events that occurred in\r\n    Scotland, about the 11th and 15th centuries.\r\n\r\n    A border family having been dispossessed of their castle and\r\n    lands by a more powerful chief, were reduced for many years to\r\n    great indigence, the expelled owner only living in the hope of\r\n    wreaking a terrible vengeance, which, agreeably to the motto of\r\n    his house, he was content to \"bide his time\" for. The usurper\r\n    having invited a large number of his kindred to a grand hunt in\r\n    his new domains, and a feast after in the great hall, returned\r\n    from the chase, and discovering the feast not spread, vented his\r\n    wrath in no measured terms on the heads of the tardy servitors.\r\n    At length a menial approached, followed by a line of servants,\r\n    and placing the boar's head on the table, the guests rushed\r\n    forward to begin the meal; when, to their horror, they\r\n    discovered, not a boar's but a bull's head,--a sign of death.\r\n    The doors were immediately closed, and the false servants, who\r\n    were the adherents of the dispossessed chief, threw off their\r\n    disguise, and falling on the usurper and his friends, butchered\r\n    them and every soul in the castle belonging to the rival\r\n    faction.\r\n\r\n    A tribe of caterans, or mountain robbers, in the Western\r\n    Highlands, having been greatly persecuted by a powerful chief of\r\n    the district, waylaid him and his retinue, put them all to the\r\n    sword, and cutting off the chief's head, repaired to his castle,\r\n    where they ordered the terrified wife to supply them with food\r\n    and drink. To appease their savage humour, the lady gave order\r\n    for their entertainment, and on returning to the hall to see her\r\n    orders were complied with, discovered, in place of the boar's\r\n    head that should have graced the board, her husband's bleeding\r\n    head; the savage caterans, in rude derision, as a substitute for\r\n    the apple or lemon usually placed between the jaws, having\r\n    thrust a slice of bread in the dead man's mouth.\r\n\r\nFOR CURING HAMS (Mons. Ude's Recipe).\r\n\r\n816. INGREDIENTS.--For 2 hams weighing about 16 or 18 lbs. each, allow 1\r\nlb. of moist sugar, 1 lb. of common salt, 2 oz. of saltpetre, 1 quart of\r\ngood vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--As soon as the pig is cold enough to be cut up, take the 2 hams\r\nand rub them well with common salt, and leave them in a large pan for 3\r\ndays. When the salt has drawn out all the blood, drain the hams, and\r\nthrow the brine away. Mix sugar, salt, and saltpetre together in the\r\nabove proportion, rub the hams well with these, and put them into a\r\nvessel large enough to hold them, always keeping the salt over them. Let\r\nthem remain for 3 days, then pour over them a quart of good vinegar.\r\nTurn them in the brine every day for a month, then drain them well, and\r\nrub them with bran. Have them smoked over a wood fire, and be particular\r\nthat the hams are hung as high up as possible from the fire; otherwise\r\nthe fat will melt, and they will become dry and hard.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To be pickled 1 month; to be smoked 1 month.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 hams of 18 lbs. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March.\r\n\r\n    THE PRICE OF A SOW IN AFRICA.--In one of the native states of\r\n    Africa, a pig one day stole a piece of food from a child as it\r\n    was in the act of conveying the morsel to its mouth; upon which\r\n    the robbed child cried so loud that the mother rushed out of her\r\n    hovel to ascertain the cause; and seeing the purloining pig make\r\n    off munching his booty, the woman in her heat struck the grunter\r\n    so smart a blow, that the surly rascal took it into his head to\r\n    go home very much indisposed, and after a certain time resolved\r\n    to die,--a resolution that he accordingly put into practice;\r\n    upon which the owner instituted judicial proceedings before the\r\n    Star Chamber court of his tribe, against the husband and family\r\n    of the woman whose rash act had led to such results; and as the\r\n    pig happened to be a _sow_, in the very flower of her age, the\r\n    prospective loss to the owner in unnumbered teems of pigs, with\r\n    the expenses attending so high a tribunal, swelled the damages\r\n    and costs to such a sum, that it was found impossible to pay\r\n    them. And as, in the barbarous justice existing among these rude\r\n    people, every member of a family is equally liable as the\r\n    individual who committed the wrong, the father, mother,\r\n    children, relatives,--an entire community, to the number of\r\n    _thirty-two souls_, were sold as slaves, and a fearful sum of\r\n    human misery perpetrated, to pay the value of a thieving old\r\n    sow.\r\n\r\nTO SALT TWO HAMS, about 12 or 15 lbs. each.\r\n\r\n817. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of treacle, 1/2 lb. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of\r\nbay-salt, 2 pounds of common salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Two days before they are put into pickle, rub the hams well\r\nwith salt, to draw away all slime and blood. Throw what comes from them\r\naway, and then rub them with treacle, saltpetre, and salt. Lay them in a\r\ndeep pan, and let them remain one day; boil the above proportion of\r\ntreacle, saltpetre, bay-salt, and common salt for 1/4 hour, and pour\r\nthis pickle boiling hot over the hams: there should be sufficient of it\r\nto cover them. For a day or two rub them well with it; afterwards they\r\nwill only require turning. They ought to remain in this pickle for 3\r\nweeks or a month, and then be sent to be smoked, which will take nearly\r\nor quite a month to do. An ox-tongue pickled in this way is most\r\nexcellent, to be eaten either green or smoked.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To remain in the pickle 3 weeks or a month; to be smoked about\r\na month.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CURE SWEET HAMS IN THE WESTMORELAND WAY.\r\n\r\n818. INGREDIENTS.--3 lbs. of common salt, 3 lbs. of coarse sugar, 1 lb.\r\nof bay-salt, 3 quarts of strong beer.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Before the hams are put into pickle, rub them the preceding day\r\nwell with salt, and drain the brine well from them. Put the above\r\ningredients into a saucepan, and boil for 1/4 hour; pour over the hams,\r\nand let them remain a month in the pickle. Rub and turn them every day,\r\nbut do not take them out of the pickling-pan; and have them smoked for a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To be pickled 1 month; to be smoked 1 month.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PICKLE HAMS (Suffolk Recipe).\r\n\r\n819. INGREDIENTS.--To a ham from 10 to 12 lbs., allow 1 lb. of coarse\r\nsugar, 3/4 lb. of salt, 1 oz. of saltpetre, 1/2 a teacupful of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the hams well with common salt, and leave them for a day or\r\ntwo to drain; then rub well in, the above proportion of sugar, salt,\r\nsaltpetre, and vinegar, and turn them every other day. Keep them in the\r\npickle 1 month, drain them, and send them to be smoked over a wood fire\r\nfor 3 weeks or a month.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To remain in the pickle 1 month. To be smoked 3 weeks or 1\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--The above proportion of pickle sufficient for 1 ham.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Hams should be pickled from October to March.\r\n\r\n    NOVEL WAY OF RECOVERING A STOLEN PIG.--It is a well-known fact,\r\n    that in Ireland the pig is, in every respect, a domesticated\r\n    animal, sharing often both the bed and board of the family, and\r\n    making an outer ring to the domestic circle, as, seated round\r\n    the pot of potatoes, they partake of the midday meal called\r\n    dinner. An Irishman upon one occasion having lost an interesting\r\n    member of his household, in the form of a promising young\r\n    porker, consulted his priest on the occasion, and having hinted\r\n    at the person he suspected of purloining the \"illegant slip of a\r\n    pig\" he was advised to take no further notice of the matter, but\r\n    leave the issue to his spiritual adviser. Next Sunday his\r\n    reverence, after mass, came to the front of the altar-rails, and\r\n    looking very hard at the supposed culprit, exclaimed, \"Who stole\r\n    Pat Doolan's pig?\" To this inquiry there was of course no\r\n    answer;--the priest did not expect there would be any. The\r\n    following Sunday the same query was propounded a little\r\n    stronger--\"Who of you was it, I say, who stole poor Pat Doolan's\r\n    pig?\" It now became evident that the culprit was a hardened\r\n    sinner; so on the third Sunday, instead of repeating the\r\n    unsatisfactory inquiry, the priest, after, as usual, eyeing the\r\n    obdurate offender, said, in a tone of pious sorrow, \"Mike Regan,\r\n    Mike Regan, you treat me with contempt!\" That night, when the\r\n    family was all asleep, the latch of the door was noiselessly\r\n    lifted, and the \"illegant slip of a pig\" cautiously slipped into\r\n    the cabin.\r\n\r\nTO SMOKE HAMS AND FISH AT HOME.\r\n\r\n820. Take an old hogshead, stop up all the crevices, and fix a place to\r\nput a cross-stick near the bottom, to hang the articles to be smoked on.\r\nNext, in the side, cut a hole near the top, to introduce an iron pan\r\nfilled with sawdust and small pieces of green wood. Having turned the\r\ntub upside down, hang the articles upon the cross-stick, introduce the\r\niron pan in the opening, and place a piece of red-hot iron in the pan,\r\ncover it with sawdust, and all will be complete. Let a large ham remain\r\n40 hours, and keep up a good smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CURE BACON OR HAMS IN THE DEVONSHIRE WAY.\r\n\r\n821. INGREDIENTS.--To every 14 lbs. of meat, allow 2 oz. of saltpetre, 2\r\noz. of salt prunella, 1 lb. of common salt. For the pickle, 3 gallons of\r\nwater, 5 lbs. of common salt, 7 lbs. of coarse sugar, 3 lbs. of\r\nbay-salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Weigh the sides, hams, and cheeks, and to every 14 lbs. allow\r\nthe above proportion of saltpetre, salt prunella, and common salt. Pound\r\nand mix these together, and rub well into the meat; lay it in a stone\r\ntrough or tub, rubbing it thoroughly, and turning it daily for 2\r\nsuccessive days. At the end of the second day, pour on it a pickle made\r\nas follows:--Put the above ingredients into a saucepan, set it on the\r\nfire, and stir frequently; remove all the scum, allow it to boil for 1/4\r\nhour, and pour it hot over the meat. Let the hams, &c., be well rubbed\r\nand turned daily; if the meat is small, a fortnight will be sufficient\r\nfor the sides and shoulders to remain in the pickle, and the hams 3\r\nweeks; if from 30 lbs. and upwards, 3 weeks will be required for the\r\nsides, &c., and from 4 to 5 weeks for the hams. On taking the pieces\r\nout, let them drain for an hour, cover with dry sawdust, and smoke from\r\na fortnight to 3 weeks. Boil and carefully skim the pickle after using,\r\nand it will keep good, closely corked, for 2 years. When boiling it for\r\nuse, add about 2 lbs. of common salt, and the same of treacle, to allow\r\nfor waste. Tongues are excellent put into this pickle cold, having been\r\nfirst rubbed well with saltpetre and salt, and allowed to remain 24\r\nhours, not forgetting to make a deep incision under the thick part of\r\nthe tongue, so as to allow the pickle to penetrate more readily. A\r\nfortnight or 3 weeks, according to the size of the tongue, will be\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n_Time_--Small meat to remain in the pickle a fortnight, hams 3 weeks; to\r\nbe smoked from a fortnight to 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe following is from Morton's \"Cyclopaedia of Agriculture,\" and will be\r\nfound fully worthy of the high character of that publication.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURING OF HAMS AND BACON.\r\n\r\n822. The carcass of the hog, after hanging over-night to cool, is laid\r\non a strong bench or stool, and the head is separated from the body at\r\nthe neck, close behind the ears; the feet and also the internal fat are\r\nremoved. The carcass is next divided into two sides in the following\r\nmanner:--The ribs are divided about an inch from the spine on each side,\r\nand the spine, with the ends of the ribs attached, together with the\r\ninternal flesh between it and the kidneys, and also the flesh above it,\r\nthroughout the whole length of the sides, are removed. The portion of\r\nthe carcass thus cut out is in the form of a wedge--the breadth of the\r\ninterior consisting of the breadth of the spine, and about an inch of\r\nthe ribs on each side, being diminished to about half an inch at the\r\nexterior or skin along the back. The breast-bone, and also the first\r\nanterior rib, are also dissected from the side. Sometimes the whole of\r\nthe ribs are removed; but this, for reasons afterwards to be noticed, is\r\na very bad practice. When the hams are cured separately from the sides,\r\nwhich is generally the case, they are cut out so as to include the\r\nhock-bone, in a similar manner to the London mode of cutting a haunch of\r\nmutton. The carcass of the hog thus cut up is ready for being salted,\r\nwhich process, in large caring establishments, is generally as follows.\r\nThe skin side of the pork is rubbed over with a mixture of fifty parts\r\nby weight of salt, and one part of saltpetre in powder, and the incised\r\nparts of the ham or flitch, and the inside of the flitch covered with\r\nthe same. The salted bacon, in pairs of flitches with the insides to\r\neach other, is piled one pair of flitches above another on benches\r\nslightly inclined, and furnished with spouts or troughs to convey the\r\nbrine to receivers in the floor of the salting-house, to be afterwards\r\nused for pickling pork for navy purposes. In this state the bacon\r\nremains a fortnight, which is sufficient for flitches cut from nogs of a\r\ncarcass weight less than 15 stone (14 lbs. to the stone). Flitches of a\r\nlarger size, at the expiration of that time, are wiped dry and reversed\r\nin their place in the pile, having, at the same time, about half the\r\nfirst quantity of fresh, dry, common salt sprinkled over the inside and\r\nincised parts; after which they remain on the benches for another week.\r\nHams being thicker than flitches, will require, when less than 20 lbs.\r\nweight, 3 weeks; and when above that weight, 4 weeks to remain under the\r\nabove-described process. The next and last process in the preparation of\r\nbacon and hams, previous to being sent to market, is drying. This is\r\neffected by hanging the flitches and hams for 2 or 3 weeks in a room\r\nheated by stoves, or in a smoke-house, in which they are exposed for the\r\nsame length of time to the smoke arising from the slow combustion of the\r\nsawdust of oak or other hard wood. The latter mode of completing the\r\ncuring process has some advantages over the other, as by it the meat is\r\nsubject to the action of _creosote_, a volatile oil produced by the\r\ncombustion of the sawdust, which is powerfully antiseptic. The process\r\nalso furnishing a thin covering of a resinous varnish, excludes the air\r\nnot only from the muscle but also from the fat; thus effectually\r\npreventing the meat from becoming rusted; and the principal reasons for\r\ncondemning the practice of removing the ribs from the flitches of pork\r\nare, that by so doing the meat becomes unpleasantly hard and pungent in\r\nthe process of salting, and by being more opposed to the action of the\r\nair, becomes sooner and more extensively rusted. Notwithstanding its\r\nsuperior efficacy in completing the process of curing, the flavour which\r\nsmoke-drying imparts to meat is disliked by many persons, and it is\r\ntherefore by no means the most general mode of drying adopted by\r\nmercantile curers. A very impure variety of _pyroligneous_ acid, or\r\nvinegar made from the destructive distillation of wood, is sometimes\r\nused, on account of the highly preservative power of the creosote which\r\nit contains, and also to impart the smoke-flavour; in which latter\r\nobject, however, the coarse flavour of tar is given, rather than that\r\nderived from the smoke from combustion of wood. A considerable portion\r\nof the bacon and hams salted in Ireland is exported from that country\r\npacked amongst salt, in bales, immediately from the salting process,\r\nwithout having been in any degree dried. In the process of salting above\r\ndescribed, pork loses from eight to ten per cent. of its weight,\r\naccording to the size and quality of the meat; and a further diminution\r\nof weight, to the extent of five to six per cent., takes place in drying\r\nduring the first fortnight after being taken out of salt; so that the\r\ntotal loss in weight occasioned by the preparation of bacon and hams in\r\na proper state for market, is not less on an average than fifteen per\r\ncent. on the weight of the fresh pork.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLARED PIG'S FACE (a Breakfast or Luncheon Dish).\r\n\r\n823. INGREDIENTS.--1 pig's face; salt. For brine, 1 gallon of spring\r\nwater, 1 lb. of common salt, 1/2 handful of chopped juniper-berries, 6\r\nbruised cloves, 2 bay-leaves, a few sprigs of thyme, basil, sage, 1/4\r\noz. of saltpetre. For forcemeat, 1/2 lb. of ham, 1/2 lb. bacon, 1\r\nteaspoonful of mixed spices, pepper to taste, 1/4 lb. of lard, 1\r\ntablespoonful of minced parsley, 6 young onions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIG'S FACE.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Singe the head carefully, bone it without breaking the skin,\r\nand rub it well with salt. Make the brine by boiling the above\r\ningredients for 1/4 hour, and letting it stand to cool. When cold, pour\r\nit over the head, and let it steep in this for 10 days, turning and\r\nrubbing it often. Then wipe, drain, and dry it. For the forcemeat, pound\r\nthe ham and bacon very finely, and mix with these the remaining\r\ningredients, taking care that the whole is thoroughly incorporated.\r\nSpread this equally over the head, roll it tightly in a cloth, and bind\r\nit securely with broad tape. Put it into a saucepan with a few meat\r\ntrimmings, and cover it with stock; let it simmer gently for 4 hours,\r\nand be particular that it does not stop boiling the whole time. When\r\nquite tender, take it up, put it between 2 dishes with a heavy weight on\r\nthe top, and when cold, remove the cloth and tape. It should be sent to\r\ntable on a napkin, or garnished with a piece of deep white paper with a\r\nruche at the top.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 hours. _Average cost_, from 2s. to 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March.\r\n\r\n    THE WILD AND DOMESTIC HOG.--The domestic hog is the descendant\r\n    of a race long since banished from this island; and it is\r\n    remarkable, that while the tamed animal has been and is kept\r\n    under surveillance, the wild type whence this race sprung, has\r\n    maintained itself in its ancient freedom, the fierce denizen of\r\n    the forest, and one of the renowned beasts of the chase.\r\n    Whatever doubt may exist as to the true origin of the dog, the\r\n    horse, the ox, and others, or as to whether their original race\r\n    is yet extant or not, these doubts do not apply to the domestic\r\n    hog. Its wild source still exists, and is universally\r\n    recognized: like the wolf, however, it has been expelled from\r\n    our island; but, like that animal, it still roams through the\r\n    vast wooded tracts of Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nTO DRESS PIG'S FRY (a Savoury Dish).\r\n\r\n824. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of pig's fry, 2 onions, a few sage-leaves,\r\n3 lbs. of potatoes, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the lean fry at the bottom of a pie-dish, sprinkle over it\r\nsome minced sage and onion, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; slice\r\nthe potatoes; put a layer of these on the seasoning, then the fat fry,\r\nthen more seasoning, and a layer of potatoes at the top. Fill the dish\r\nwith boiling water, and bake for 2 hours, or rather longer.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 2 hours. _Average cost_, 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MELT LARD.\r\n\r\n825. Melt the inner fat of the pig, by putting it in a stone jar, and\r\nplacing this in a saucepan of boiling water, previously stripping off\r\nthe skin. Let it simmer gently over a bright fire, and as it melts, pour\r\nit carefully from the sediment. Put it into small jars or bladders for\r\nuse, and keep it in a cool place. The flead or inside fat of the pig,\r\nbefore it is melted, makes exceedingly light crust, and is particularly\r\nwholesome. It may be preserved a length of time by salting it well, and\r\noccasionally changing the brine. When wanted for use, wash and wipe it,\r\nand it will answer for making into paste as well as fresh lard.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. per lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED LEG OF PORK.\r\n\r\n826. INGREDIENTS.--Leg of pork; salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--For boiling, choose a small, compact, well-filled leg, and rub\r\nit well with salt; let it remain in pickle for a week or ten days,\r\nturning and rubbing it every day. An hour before dressing it, put it\r\ninto cold water for an hour, which improves the colour. If the pork is\r\npurchased ready salted, ascertain how long the meat has been in pickle,\r\nand soak it accordingly. Put it into a boiling-pot, with sufficient cold\r\nwater to cover it; let it gradually come to a boil, and remove the scum\r\nas it rises. Simmer it very gently until tender, and do not allow it to\r\nboil fast, or the knuckle will fall to pieces before the middle of the\r\nleg is done. Carrots, turnips, or parsnips may be boiled with the pork,\r\nsome of which should be laid round the dish as a garnish, and a\r\nwell-made pease-pudding is an indispensable accompaniment.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A leg of pork weighing 8 lbs., 3 hours after the water boils,\r\nand to be simmered very gently.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The liquor in which a leg of pork has been boiled, makes\r\nexcellent pea-soup.\r\n\r\n    ANTIQUITY OF THE HOG.--The hog has survived changes which have\r\n    swept multitudes of pachydermatous animals from the surface of\r\n    our earth. It still presents the same characteristics, both\r\n    physical and moral, which the earliest writers, whether sacred\r\n    or profane, have faithfully delineated. Although the domestic\r\n    has been more or less modified by long culture, yet the wild\r\n    species remains unaltered, insomuch that the fossil relics may\r\n    be identified with the bones of their existing descendants.\r\n\r\nROAST GRISKIN OF PORK.\r\n\r\n827. INGREDIENTS.--Pork; a little powdered sage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPARE-RIB OF PORK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRISKIN OF PORK.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--As this joint frequently comes to table hard and dry,\r\nparticular care should be taken that it is well basted. Put it down to a\r\nbright fire, and flour it. About 10 minutes before taking it up,\r\nsprinkle over some powdered sage; make a little gravy in the\r\ndripping-pan, strain it over the meat, and serve with a tureen of apple\r\nsauce. This joint will be done in far less time than when the skin is\r\nleft on, consequently, should have the greatest attention that it be not\r\ndried up.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Griskin of pork weighing 6 lbs., 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 7d. per lb. _Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A spare-rib of pork is roasted in the same manner as above, and\r\nwould take 1-1/2 hour for one weighing about 6 lbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BACON FOR LARDING, AND LARDING-NEEDLE.]\r\n\r\nLARDING.\r\n\r\n828. INGREDIENTS.--Bacon and larding-needle.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Bacon for larding should be firm and fat, and ought to be cured\r\nwithout any saltpetre, as this reddens white meats. Lay it on a table,\r\nthe rinds downwards; trim off any rusty part, and cut it into slices of\r\nan equal thickness. Place the slices one on the top of another, and cut\r\nthem evenly into narrow strips, so arranging it that every piece of\r\nbacon is of the same size. Bacon for fricandeau, poultry, and game,\r\nshould be about 2 inches in length, and rather more than one-eighth of\r\nan inch in width. If for larding fillets of beef or loin of veal, the\r\npieces of bacon must be thicker. The following recipe of Soyer is, we\r\nthink, very explicit; and any cook, by following the directions here\r\ngiven, may be able to lard, if not well, sufficiently for general use.\r\n\r\n\"Have the fricandeau trimmed, lay it, lengthwise, upon a clean napkin\r\nacross your hand, forming a kind of bridge with your thumb at the part\r\nyou are about to commence at; then with the point of the larding-needle\r\nmake three distinct lines across, 1/2 inch apart; run the needle into\r\nthe third line, at the further side of the fricandeau, and bring it out\r\nat the first, placing one of the lardoons in it; draw the needle\r\nthrough, leaving out 1/4 inch of the bacon at each line; proceed thus to\r\nthe end of the row; then make another line, 1/2 inch distant, stick in\r\nanother row of lardoons, bringing them out at the second line, leaving\r\nthe ends of the bacon out all the same length; make the next row again\r\nat the same distance, bringing the ends out between the lardoons of the\r\nfirst row, proceeding in this manner until the whole surface is larded\r\nin chequered rows. Everything else is larded in a similar way; and, in\r\nthe case of poultry, hold the breast over a charcoal fire for one\r\nminute, or dip it into boiling water, in order to make the flesh firm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST LOIN OF PORK.\r\n\r\n829. INGREDIENTS.--Pork; a little salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORE LOIN OF PORK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIND LOIN OF PORK.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Score the skin in strips rather more than 1/4 inch apart, and\r\nplace the joint at a good distance from the fire, on account of the\r\ncrackling, which would harden before the meat would be heated through,\r\nwere it placed too near. If very lean, it should be rubbed over with a\r\nlittle salad oil, and kept well basted all the time it is at the fire.\r\nPork should be very thoroughly cooked, but not dry; and be careful never\r\nto send it to table the least underdone, as nothing is more unwholesome\r\nand disagreeable than underdressed white meats. Serve with apple sauce,\r\nNo. 363, and a little gravy made in the dripping-pan. A stuffing of sage\r\nand onion may be made separately, and baked in a flat dish: this method\r\nis better than putting it in the meat, as many persons have so great an\r\nobjection to the flavour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A loin of pork weighing 5 lbs., about 2 hours: allow more time\r\nshould it be very fat.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n    FOSSIL REMAINS OF THE HOG.--In British strata, the oldest fossil\r\n    remains of the hog which Professor Owen states that he has\r\n    examined, were from fissures in the red crag (probably miocene)\r\n    of Newbourne, near Woodbridge, Suffolk. \"They were associated\r\n    with teeth of an extinct _felis_ about the size of a leopard,\r\n    with those of a bear, and with remains of a large cervus. These\r\n    mammalian remains were found with the ordinary fossils of the\r\n    red crag: they had undergone the same process of trituration,\r\n    and were impregnated with the same colouring matter as the\r\n    associated bones and teeth of fishes acknowledged to be derived\r\n    from the regular strata of the red crag. These mammaliferous\r\n    beds have been proved by Mr. Lyell to be older than the\r\n    fluvio-marine, or Norwich crag, in which remains of the\r\n    mastodon, rhinoceros, and horse have been discovered; and still\r\n    older than the fresh-water pleistocene deposits, from which the\r\n    remains of the mammoth, rhinoceros, &c. are obtained in such\r\n    abundance. I have met,\" says the professor, in addition, \"with\r\n    some satisfactory instances of the association of fossil remains\r\n    of a species of hog with those of the mammoth, in the newer\r\n    pliocene freshwater formations of England.\"\r\n\r\nTO DRY PIGS' CHEEKS.\r\n\r\n830. INGREDIENTS.--Salt, 4 oz. of saltpetre, 2 oz. of bay-salt, 4 oz. of\r\ncoarse sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut out the snout, remove the brains, and split the head,\r\ntaking off the upper bone to make the jowl a good shape; rub it well\r\nwith salt; next day take away the brine, and salt it again the following\r\nday; cover the head with saltpetre, bay-salt, and coarse sugar, in the\r\nabove proportion, adding a little common salt. Let the head be often\r\nturned, and when it has been in the pickle for 10 days, smoke it for a\r\nweek or rather longer.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To remain in the pickle 10 days; to be smoked 1 week.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Should be made from September to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A pig's check, or Bath chap, will take about 2 hours after the\r\nwater boils.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIG'S LIVER (a Savoury and Economical Dish).\r\n\r\n831. INGREDIENTS.--The liver and lights of a pig, 6 or 7 slices of\r\nbacon, potatoes, 1 large bunch of parsley, 2 onions, 2 sage-leaves,\r\npepper and salt to taste, a little broth or water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice the liver and lights, and wash these perfectly clean, and\r\nparboil the potatoes; mince the parsley and sage, and chop the onion\r\nrather small. Put the meat, potatoes, and bacon into a deep tin dish, in\r\nalternate layers, with a sprinkling of the herbs, and a seasoning of\r\npepper and salt between each; pour on a little water or broth, and bake\r\nin a moderately-heated oven for 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIG'S PETTITOES.\r\n\r\n832. INGREDIENTS.--A thin slice of bacon, 1 onion, 1 blade of mace, 6\r\npeppercorns, 3 or 4 sprigs of thyme, 1 pint of gravy, pepper and salt to\r\ntaste, thickening of butter and flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the liver, heart, and pettitoes into a stewpan with the\r\nbacon, mace, peppercorns, thyme, onion, and gravy, and simmer these\r\ngently for 1/4 hour; then take out the heart and liver, and mince them\r\nvery fine. Keep stewing the feet until quite tender, which will be in\r\nfrom 20 minutes to 1/2 hour, reckoning from the time that they boiled up\r\nfirst; then put back the minced liver, thicken the gravy with a little\r\nbutter and flour, season with pepper and salt, and simmer over a gentle\r\nfire for 5 minutes, occasionally stirring the contents. Dish the mince,\r\nsplit the feet, and arrange them round alternately with sippets of\r\ntoasted bread, and pour the gravy in the middle.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 40 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PICKLE PORK.\r\n\r\n833. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of saltpetre; salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--As pork does not keep long without being salted, cut it into\r\npieces of a suitable size as soon as the pig is cold. Rub the pieces of\r\npork well with salt, and put them into a pan with a sprinkling of it\r\nbetween each piece: as it melts on the top, strew on more. Lay a coarse\r\ncloth over the pan, a board over that, and a weight on the board, to\r\nkeep the pork down in the brine. If excluded from the air, it will\r\ncontinue good for nearly 2 years.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. per lb. for the prime parts.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--The best time for pickling meat is late in the autumn.\r\n\r\n    THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE HOG.--A singular circumstance in the\r\n    domestic history of the hog, is the extent of its distribution\r\n    over the surface of the earth; being found even in insulated\r\n    places, where the inhabitants are semi-barbarous, and where the\r\n    wild species is entirely unknown. The South-Sea islands, for\r\n    example, were found on their discovery to be well stocked with a\r\n    small black hog; and the traditionary belief of the people was\r\n    that these animals were coeval with the origin of themselves.\r\n    Yet they possessed no knowledge of the wild boar, or any other\r\n    animal of the hog kind, from which the domestic breed might be\r\n    supposed to be derived. In these islands the hog is the\r\n    principal quadruped, and the fruit of the bread-tree is its\r\n    principal food, although it is also fed with yams, eddoes, and\r\n    other vegetables. This nutritious diet, which it has in great\r\n    abundance, is, according to Foster, the reason of its flesh\r\n    being so delicious, so full of juice, and so rich in fat, which\r\n    is not less delicate to the taste than the finest butter.\r\n\r\nTO BOIL PICKLED PORK.\r\n\r\n834. INGREDIENTS.--Pork; water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Should the pork be very salt, let it remain in water about 2\r\nhours before it is dressed; put it into a saucepan with sufficient cold\r\nwater to cover it, let it gradually come to a boil, then gently simmer\r\nuntil quite tender. Allow ample time for it to cook, as nothing is more\r\ndisagreeable than underdone pork, and when boiled fast, the meat becomes\r\nhard. This is sometimes served with boiled poultry and roast veal,\r\ninstead of bacon: when tender, and not over salt, it will be found\r\nequally good.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A piece of pickled pork weighing 2 lbs., 1-1/4 hour; 4 lbs.,\r\nrather more than 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. per lb. for the primest parts.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    THE ANTIQUITY OF THE HOG.--By what nation and in what period the\r\n    hog was reclaimed, is involved in the deepest obscurity. So far\r\n    back as we have any records of history, we find notices of this\r\n    animal, and of its flesh being used as the food of man. By some\r\n    nations, however, its flesh was denounced as unclean, and\r\n    therefore prohibited to be used, whilst by others it was\r\n    esteemed as a great delicacy. By the Mosaic law it was forbidden\r\n    to be eaten by the Jews, and the Mahometans hold it in utter\r\n    abhorrence. Dr. Kitto, however, says that there does not appear\r\n    to be any reason in the law of Moses why the hog should be held\r\n    in such peculiar abomination. There seems nothing to have\r\n    prevented the Jews, if they had been so inclined, to rear pigs\r\n    for sale, or for the use of the land. In the Talmud there are\r\n    some indications that this was actually done; and it was,\r\n    probably, for such purposes that the herds of swine mentioned in\r\n    the New Testament were kept, although it is usual to consider\r\n    that they were kept by the foreign settlers in the land. Indeed,\r\n    the story which accounts for the peculiar aversion of the\r\n    Hebrews to the hog, assumes that it did not originate until\r\n    about 130 years before Christ, and that, previously, some Jews\r\n    were in the habit of rearing hogs for the purposes indicated.\r\n\r\nPORK PIES (Warwickshire Recipe).\r\n\r\n835. INGREDIENTS.--For the crust, 5 lbs. of lard to 14 lbs. of flour,\r\nmilk, and water. For filling the pies, to every 3 lbs. of meat allow 1\r\noz. of salt, 2-1/4 oz. of pepper, a small quantity of cayenne, 1 pint of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub into the flour a portion of the lard; the remainder put\r\nwith sufficient milk and water to mix the crust, and boil this gently\r\nfor 1/4 hour. Pour it boiling on the flour, and knead and beat it till\r\nperfectly smooth. Now raise the crust in either a round or oval form,\r\ncut up the pork into pieces the size of a nut, season it in the above\r\nproportion, and press it compactly into the pie, in alternate layers of\r\nfat and lean, and pour in a small quantity of water; lay on the lid, cut\r\nthe edges smoothly round, and pinch them together. Bake in a brick oven,\r\nwhich should be slow, as the meat is very solid. Very frequently, the\r\ninexperienced cook finds much difficulty in raising the crust. She\r\nshould bear in mind that it must not be allowed to get cold, or it will\r\nfall immediately: to prevent this, the operation should be performed as\r\nnear the fire as possible. As considerable dexterity and expertness are\r\nnecessary to raise the crust with the hand only, a glass bottle or small\r\njar may be placed in the middle of the paste, and the crust moulded on\r\nthis; but be particular that it is kept warm the whole time.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--The proportions for 1 pie are 1 lb. of flour and 3 lbs.\r\nof meat.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n    THE FLESH OF SWINE IN HOT CLIMATES.--It is observed by M.\r\n    Sonini, that the flesh of swine, in hot climates, is considered\r\n    unwholesome, and therefore may account for its proscription by\r\n    the legislators and priests of the East. In Egypt, Syria, and\r\n    even the southern parts of Greece, although both white and\r\n    delicate, it is so flabby and surcharged with fat, that it\r\n    disagrees with the strongest stomachs. Abstinence from it in\r\n    general was, therefore, indispensable to health under the\r\n    burning suns of Egypt and Arabia. The Egyptians were permitted\r\n    to eat it only once a year,--on the feast of the moon; and then\r\n    they sacrificed a number of these animals to that planet. At\r\n    other seasons, should any one even touch a hog, he was obliged\r\n    immediately to plunge into the river Nile, as he stood, with his\r\n    clothes on, in order to purify himself from the supposed\r\n    contamination he had contracted by the touch.\r\n\r\nLITTLE RAISED PORK PIES.\r\n\r\n836. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of flour, 1/2 lb. of butter, 1/2 lb. of mutton\r\nsuet, salt and white pepper to taste, 4 lbs. of the neck of pork, 1\r\ndessertspoonful of powdered sage.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Well dry the flour, mince the suet, and put these with the\r\nbutter into a saucepan, to be made hot, and add a little salt. When\r\nmelted, mix it up into a stiff paste, and put it before the fire with a\r\ncloth over it until ready to make up; chop the pork into small pieces,\r\nseason it with white pepper, salt, and powdered sage; divide the paste\r\ninto rather small pieces, raise it in a round or oval form, fill with\r\nthe meat, and bake in a brick oven. These pies will require a fiercer\r\noven than those in the preceding recipe, as they are made so much\r\nsmaller, and consequently do not require so soaking a heat.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--If made small, about 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n    SWINEHERDS OF ANTIQUITY.--From the prejudice against the hog\r\n    among the ancients, those who tended them formed an isolated\r\n    class, and were esteemed as the outcasts of society. However\r\n    much the flesh of the animal was esteemed by the Greeks and\r\n    Romans, yet the swineherd is not mentioned by either the classic\r\n    writers or the poets who, in ancient Greece and Rome, painted\r\n    rural life. We have no descriptions of gods or heroes descending\r\n    to the occupation of keeping swine. The swineherd is never\r\n    introduced into the idyls of Theocritus, nor has Virgil admitted\r\n    him into his eclogues. The Eumaeus of Homer is the only\r\n    exception that we have of a swineherd meeting with favour in the\r\n    eyes of a poet of antiquity. This may be accounted for, on the\r\n    supposition that the prejudices of the Egyptians relative to\r\n    this class of men, extended to both Greece and Italy, and\r\n    imparted a bias to popular opinion.\r\n\r\nTO MAKE SAUSAGES.\r\n\r\n(_Author's Oxford Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n837. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of pork, fat and lean, without skin or gristle;\r\n1 lb. of lean veal, 1 lb. of beef suet, 1/2 lb. of bread crumbs, the\r\nrind of 1/2 lemon, 1 small nutmeg, 6 sage-leaves, 1 teaspoonful of\r\npepper, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt, 1/2 teaspoonful of savory, 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of marjoram.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the pork, veal, and suet finely together, add the bread\r\ncrumbs, lemon-peel (which should be well minced), and a small nutmeg\r\ngrated. Wash and chop the sage-leaves very finely; add these with the\r\nremaining ingredients to the sausage-meat, and when thoroughly mixed,\r\neither put the meat into skins, or, when wanted for table, form it into\r\nlittle cakes, which should be floured and fried.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for about 30 moderate-sized sausages.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March.\r\n\r\n    THE HOG IN ENGLAND.--From time immemorial, in England, this\r\n    animal has been esteemed as of the highest importance. In the\r\n    Anglo-Saxon period, vast herds of swine were tended by men, who\r\n    watched over their safety, and who collected them under shelter\r\n    at night. At that time, the flesh of the animal was the staple\r\n    article of consumption in every family, and a large portion of\r\n    the wealth of the rich freemen of the country consisted of these\r\n    animals. Hence it was common to make bequests of swine, with\r\n    lands for their support; and to these were attached rights and\r\n    privileges in connection with their feeding, and the extent of\r\n    woodland to be occupied by a given number was granted in\r\n    accordance with established rules. This is proved by an ancient\r\n    Saxon grant, quoted by Sharon Turner, in his \"History of the\r\n    Anglo-Saxons,\" where the right of pasturage is conveyed in a\r\n    deed by the following words:--\"I give food for seventy swine in\r\n    that woody allotment which the countrymen call Wolferdinlegh.\"\r\n\r\nFRIED SAUSAGES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRIED SAUSAGES.]\r\n\r\n838. INGREDIENTS.--Sausages; a small piece of butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Prick the sausages with a fork (this prevents them from\r\nbursting), and put them into a frying-pan with a small piece of butter.\r\nKeep moving the pan about, and turn the sausages 3 or 4 times. In from\r\n10 to 12 minutes they will be sufficiently cooked, unless they are _very\r\nlarge_, when a little more time should be allowed for them. Dish them\r\nwith or without a piece of toast under them, and serve very hot. In some\r\ncounties, sausages are boiled and served on toast. They should be\r\nplunged into boiling water, and simmered for about 10 or 12 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 to 12 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Good from September to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Sometimes, in close warm weather, sausages very soon turn sour;\r\nto prevent this, put them in the oven for a few minutes with a small\r\npiece of butter to keep them moist. When wanted for table, they will not\r\nrequire so long frying as uncooked sausages.\r\n\r\n    THE SAXON SWINEHERD.--The men employed in herding swine during\r\n    the Anglo-Saxon period of our history were, in general, thralls\r\n    or born slaves of the soil, who were assisted by powerful dogs,\r\n    capable even of singly contending with the wolf until his master\r\n    came with his spear to the rescue. In the \"Ivanhoe\" of Sir\r\n    Walter Scott, we have an admirable picture, in the character of\r\n    Gurth, an Anglo-Saxon swineherd, as we also have of his master,\r\n    a large landed proprietor, a great portion of whose wealth\r\n    consisted of swine, and whose rude but plentiful board was\r\n    liberally supplied with the flesh.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-MEAT CAKES.\r\n\r\n839. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of lean pork, add 3/4 lb. of fat bacon,\r\n1/4 oz. of salt, 1 saltspoonful of pepper, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated\r\nnutmeg, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Remove from the pork all skin, gristle, and bone, and chop it\r\nfinely with the bacon; add the remaining ingredients, and carefully mix\r\naltogether. Pound it well in a mortar, make it into convenient-sized\r\ncakes, flour these, and fry them a nice brown for about 10 minutes. This\r\nis a very simple method of making sausage-meat, and on trial will prove\r\nvery good, its great recommendation being, that it is so easily made.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SCALD A SUCKING-PIG.\r\n\r\n840. Put the pig into cold water directly it is killed; let it remain\r\nfor a few minutes, then immerse it in a large pan of boiling water for 2\r\nminutes. Take it out, lay it on a table, and pull off the hair as\r\nquickly as possible. When the skin looks clean, make a slit down the\r\nbelly, take out the entrails, well clean the nostrils and ears, wash the\r\npig in cold water, and wipe it thoroughly dry. Take off the feet at the\r\nfirst joint, and loosen and leave sufficient skin to turn neatly over.\r\nIf not to be dressed immediately, fold it in a wet cloth to keep it from\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n    THE LEARNED PIG.--That the pig is capable of education, is a\r\n    fact long known to the world; and though, like the ass,\r\n    naturally stubborn and obstinate, that he is equally amenable\r\n    with other animals to caresses and kindness, has been shown from\r\n    very remote time; the best modern evidence of his docility,\r\n    however, is the instance of the learned pig, first exhibited\r\n    about a century since, but which has been continued down to our\r\n    own time by repeated instances of an animal who will put\r\n    together all the letters or figures that compose the day, month,\r\n    hour, and date of the exhibition, besides many other\r\n    unquestioned evidences of memory. The instance already given of\r\n    breaking a sow into a pointer, till she became more stanch even\r\n    than the dog itself, though surprising, is far less wonderful\r\n    than that evidence of education where so generally obtuse an\r\n    animal may be taught not only to spell, but couple figures and\r\n    give dates correctly.\r\n\r\nROAST SUCKING-PIG.\r\n\r\n841. INGREDIENTS.--Pig, 6 oz. of bread crumbs, 16 sage-leaves, pepper\r\nand salt to taste, a piece of butter the size of an egg, salad oil or\r\nbutter to baste with, about 1/2 pint of gravy, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nlemon-juice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST SUCKING-PIG.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--A sucking-pig, to be eaten in perfection, should not be more\r\nthan three weeks old, and should be dressed the same day that it is\r\nkilled. After preparing the pig for cooking, as in the preceding recipe,\r\nstuff it with finely-grated bread crumbs, minced sage, pepper, salt, and\r\na piece of butter the size of an egg, all of which should be well mixed\r\ntogether, and put into the body of the pig. Sew up the slit neatly, and\r\ntruss the legs back, to allow the inside to be roasted, and the under\r\npart to be crisp. Put the pig down to a bright clear fire, not too near,\r\nand let it lay till thoroughly dry; then have ready some butter tied up\r\nin a piece of thin cloth, and rub the pig with this in every part. Keep\r\nit well rubbed with the butter the whole of the time it is roasting, and\r\ndo not allow the crackling to become blistered or burnt. When half-done,\r\nhang a pig-iron before the middle part (if this is not obtainable, use a\r\nflat iron), to prevent its being scorched and dried up before the ends\r\nare done. Before it is taken from the fire, cut off the head, and part\r\nthat and the body down the middle. Chop the brains and mix them with the\r\nstuffing; add 1/2 pint of good gravy, a tablespoonful of lemon-juice,\r\nand the gravy that flowed from the pig; put a little of this on the dish\r\nwith the pig, and the remainder send to table in a tureen. Place the pig\r\nback to back in the dish, with one half of the head on each side, and\r\none of the ears at each end, and send it to table as hot as possible.\r\nInstead of butter, many cooks take salad oil for basting, which makes\r\nthe crackling crisp; and as this is one of the principal things to be\r\nconsidered, perhaps it is desirable to use it; but be particular that it\r\nis very pure, or it will impart an unpleasant flavour to the meat. The\r\nbrains and stuffing may be stirred into a tureen of melted butter\r\ninstead of gravy, when the latter is not liked. Apple sauce and the\r\nold-fashioned currant sauce are not yet quite obsolete as an\r\naccompaniment to roast pig.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 to 2 hours for a small pig.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 5s. to 6s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 9 or 10 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to February.\r\n\r\n    HOW ROAST PIG WAS DISCOVERED.--Charles Lamb, who, in the early\r\n    part of this century, delighted the reading public by his quaint\r\n    prose sketches, written under the title of \"Essays of Elia,\"\r\n    has, in his own quiet humorous way, devoted one paper to the\r\n    subject of _Roast Pig_, and more especially to that luxurious\r\n    and toothsome dainty known as \"CRACKLING;\" and shows, in a\r\n    manner peculiarly his own, _how crackling first came into the\r\n    world._\r\n\r\n    According to this erudite authority, man in the golden age, or\r\n    at all events the primitive age, eat his pork and bacon raw, as,\r\n    indeed, he did his beef and mutton; unless, as Hudibras tells\r\n    us, he was an epicure, when he used to make a saddle of his\r\n    saddle of mutton, and after spreading it on his horse's back,\r\n    and riding on it for a few hours till thoroughly warmed, he sat\r\n    down to the luxury of a dish cooked to a turn. At the epoch of\r\n    the story, however, a citizen of some Scythian community had the\r\n    misfortune to have his hut, or that portion of it containing his\r\n    live stock of pigs, burnt down. In going over the _débris_ on\r\n    the following day, and picking out all the available salvage,\r\n    the proprietor touched something unusually or unexpectedly hot,\r\n    which caused him to shake his hand with great energy, and clap\r\n    the tips of his suffering fingers to his mouth. The act was\r\n    simple and natural, but the result was wonderful. He rolled his\r\n    eyes in ecstatic pleasure, his frame distended, and, conscious\r\n    of a celestial odour, his nostrils widened, and, while drawing\r\n    in deep inspirations of the ravishing perfume, he sucked his\r\n    fingers with a gusto he had never, in his most hungry moments,\r\n    conceived. Clearing away the rubbish from beneath him, he at\r\n    last brought to view the carcase of one of his pigs, _roasted to\r\n    death_. Stooping down to examine this curious object, and\r\n    touching its body, a fragment of the burnt skin was detached,\r\n    which, with a sort of superstitious dread, he at length, and in\r\n    a spirit of philosophical inquiry, put into his mouth. Ye gods!\r\n    the felicity he then enjoyed, no pen can chronicle! Then it was\r\n    that he--the world--first tasted _crackling_. Like a miser with\r\n    his gold, the Scythian hid his treasure from the prying eyes of\r\n    the world, and feasted, in secret, more sumptuously than the\r\n    gods. When he had eaten up all his pig, the poor man fell into a\r\n    melancholy; he refused the most tempting steak, though cooked on\r\n    the horse's back, and turned every half-hour after his own\r\n    favourite recipe; he fell, in fact, from his appetite, and was\r\n    reduced to a shadow, till, unable longer to endure the torments\r\n    of memory he hourly suffered, he rose one night and secretly set\r\n    fire to his hut, and once more was restored to flesh and\r\n    manhood. Finding it impossible to live in future without\r\n    roast-pig, he set fire to his house every time his larder became\r\n    empty; till at last his neighbours, scandalized by the frequency\r\n    of these incendiary acts, brought his conduct before the supreme\r\n    council of the nation. To avert the penalty that awaited him, he\r\n    brought his judges to the smouldering ruins, and discovering the\r\n    secret, invited them to eat; which having done, with tears of\r\n    gratitude, the august synod embraced him, and, with an\r\n    overflowing feeling of ecstasy, dedicated a statue to the memory\r\n    of the man who first _instituted roast pork_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORK CARVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCKING-PIG.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUCKING-PIG.]\r\n\r\n842. A sucking-pig seems, at first sight, rather an elaborate dish, or\r\nrather animal, to carve; but by carefully mastering the details of the\r\nbusiness, every difficulty will vanish; and if a partial failure be at\r\nfirst made, yet all embarrassment will quickly disappear on a second\r\ntrial. A sucking-pig is usually sent to table in the manner shown in the\r\nengraving (and also in coloured plate S), and the first point to be\r\nattended to is to separate the shoulder from the carcase, by carrying\r\nthe knife quickly and neatly round the circular line, as shown by the\r\nfigures 1, 2, 3;--the shoulder will then easily come away. The next step\r\nis to take off the leg; and this is done in the same way, by cutting\r\nround this joint in the direction shown by the figures 1, 2, 3, in the\r\nsame way as the shoulder. The ribs then stand fairly open to the knife,\r\nwhich should be carried down in the direction of the line 4 to 5; and\r\ntwo or three helpings will dispose of these. The other half of the pig\r\nis served, of course, in the same manner. Different parts of the pig are\r\nvariously esteemed; some preferring the flesh of the neck; others, the\r\nribs; and others, again, the shoulders. The truth is, the whole of a\r\nsucking-pig is delicious, delicate eating; but, in carving it, the host\r\nshould consult the various tastes and fancies of his guests, keeping the\r\nlarger joints, generally, for the gentlemen of the party.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAM.]\r\n\r\n843. In cutting a ham, the carver must be guided according as he desires\r\nto practise economy, or have, at once, fine slices out of the prime\r\npart. Under the first supposition, he will commence at the knuckle end,\r\nand cut off thin slices towards the thick part of the ham. To reach the\r\nchoicer portion, the knife, which must be very sharp and thin, should be\r\ncarried quite down to the bone, in the direction of the line 1 to 2. The\r\nslices should be thin and even, and always cut down to the bone. There\r\nare some who like to carve a ham by cutting a hole at the top, and then\r\nslicing pieces off inside the hole, gradually enlarging the circle; but\r\nwe think this a plan not to be recommended. A ham, when hot, is usually\r\nsent to table with a paper ruffle round the knuckle; when cold, it is\r\nserved in the manner shown by coloured plate P.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEG OF PORK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEG OF PORK.]\r\n\r\n844. This joint, which is such a favourite one with many people, is easy\r\nto carve. The knife should be carried sharply down to the bone, clean\r\nthrough the crackling, in the direction of the line 1 to 2. Sago and\r\nonion and apple sauce are usually sent to table with this\r\ndish,--sometimes the leg of pork is stuffed,--and the guests should be\r\nasked if they will have either or both. A frequent plan, and we think a\r\ngood one, is now pursued, of sending sage and onion to table separately\r\nfrom the joint, as it is not everybody to whom the flavour of this\r\nstuffing is agreeable.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The other dishes of pork do not call for any special remarks as\r\nto their carving or helping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE CALF.\r\n\r\n845. ANY REMARKS MADE ON THE CALF OR THE LAMB must naturally be in a\r\nmeasure supplementary to the more copious observations made on the\r\nparent stock of either. As the calf, at least as far as it is identified\r\nwith veal, is destined to die young,--to be, indeed, cut off in its\r\ncomparative infancy,--it may, at first sight, appear of little or no\r\nconsequence to inquire to what particular variety, or breed of the\r\ngeneral stock, his sire or dam may belong. The great art, however, in\r\nthe modern science of husbandry has been to obtain an animal that shall\r\nnot only have the utmost beauty of form of which the species is capable,\r\nbut, at the same time, a constitution free from all taint, a frame that\r\nshall rapidly attain bulk and stature, and a disposition so kindly that\r\nevery _quantum_ of food it takes shall, without drawback or\r\nprocrastination, be eliminated into fat and muscle. The breed, then, is\r\nof very considerable consequence in determining, not only the quality of\r\nthe meat to the consumer, but its commercial value to the breeder and\r\nbutcher.\r\n\r\n846. UNDER THE ARTIFICIAL SYSTEM adopted in the rearing of domestic\r\ncattle, and stock in general, to gratify the arbitrary mandates of\r\nluxury and fashion, we can have veal, like lamb, at all seasons in the\r\nmarket, though the usual time in the metropolis for veal to make its\r\nappearance is about the beginning of February.\r\n\r\n847. THE COW GOES WITH YOUNG FOR NINE MONTHS, and the affection and\r\nsolicitude she evinces for her offspring is more human in its tenderness\r\nmid intensity than is displayed by any other animal; and her distress\r\nwhen she hears its bleating, and is not allowed to reach it with her\r\ndistended udders, is often painful to witness, and when the calf has\r\ndied, or been accidentally killed, her grief frequently makes her refuse\r\nto give down her milk. At such times, the breeder has adopted the\r\nexpedient of flaying the dead carcase, and, distending the skin with\r\nhay, lays the effigy before her, and then taking advantage of her\r\nsolicitude, milks her while she is caressing the skin with her tongue.\r\n\r\n848. IN A STATE OF NATURE, the cow, like the deer, hides her young in\r\nthe tall ferns and brakes, and the most secret places; and only at\r\nstated times, twice or thrice a day, quits the herd, and, hastening to\r\nthe secret cover, gives suck to her calf, and with the same,\r\ncircumspection returns to the community.\r\n\r\n849. IN SOME COUNTRIES, to please the epicurean taste of vitiated\r\nappetites, it is the custom to kill the calf for food almost immediately\r\nafter birth, and any accident that forestalls that event, is considered\r\nto enhance its value. We are happy to say, however, that in this\r\ncountry, as far as England and Scotland are concerned, the taste for\r\nvery young veal has entirely gone out, and \"Staggering Bob,\" as the poor\r\nlittle animal was called in the language of the shambles, is no longer\r\nto be met with in such a place.\r\n\r\n850. THE WEANING OF CALVES is a process that requires a great amount of\r\ncare and judgment; for though they are in reality not weaned till\r\nbetween the eighth and the twelfth week, the process of rearing them by\r\nhand commences in fact from the birth, the calf never being allowed to\r\nsuck its dam. As the rearing of calves for the market is a very\r\nimportant and lucrative business, the breeder generally arranges his\r\nstock so that ten or a dozen of his cows shall calve about the same\r\ntime; and then, by setting aside one or two, to find food for the entire\r\nfamily, gets the remaining eight or ten with their full fountains of\r\nmilk, to carry on the operations of his dairy. Some people have an idea\r\nthat skimmed milk, if given in sufficient quantity, is good enough for\r\nthe weaning period of calf-feeding; but this is a very serious mistake,\r\nfor the cream, of which it has been deprived, contained nearly all the\r\noleaginous principles, and the azote or nitrogen, on which the vivifying\r\nproperties of that fluid depends. Indeed, so remarkably correct has this\r\nfact proved to be, that a calf reared on one part of new milk mixed with\r\nfive of water, will thrive and look well; while another, treated with\r\nunlimited skimmed milk, will be poor, thin, and miserable.\r\n\r\n851. IT IS SOMETIMES A MATTER OF CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE to induce the\r\nblundering calf--whose instinct only teaches him to suck, and that he\r\nwill do at anything and with anything--acquire the knowledge of\r\nimbibition, that for the first few days it is often necessary to fill a\r\nbottle with milk, and, opening his mouth, pour the contents down his\r\nthroat. The manner, however, by which he is finally educated into the\r\nmystery of suction, is by putting his allowance of milk into a large\r\nwooden bowl; the nurse then puts her hand into the milk, and, by bending\r\nher fingers upwards, makes a rude teat for the calf to grasp in his\r\nlips, when the vacuum caused by his suction of the fingers, causes the\r\nmilk to rise along them into his mouth. In this manner one by one the\r\nwhole family are to be fed three times a day; care being taken, that\r\nnew-born calves are not, at first, fed on milk from a cow who has some\r\ndays calved.\r\n\r\n852. AS THE CALF PROGRESSES TOWARDS HIS TENTH WEEK, his diet requires to\r\nbe increased in quantity and quality; for these objects, his milk can be\r\nthickened with flour or meal, and small pieces of softened oil-cake are\r\nto be slipped into his mouth after sucking, that they may dissolve\r\nthere, till he grows familiar with, and to like the taste, when it may\r\nbe softened and scraped down into his milk-and-water. After a time,\r\nsliced turnips softened by steam are to be given to him in tolerable\r\nquantities; then succulent grasses; and finally, hay may be added to the\r\nothers. Some farmers, desirous of rendering their calves fat for the\r\nbutcher in as short a time as possible, forget both the natural weakness\r\nof the digestive powers, and the contracted volume of the stomach, and\r\nallow the animals either to suck _ad libitum_, or give them, if brought\r\nup at the pail or by hand, a larger quantity of milk than they can\r\ndigest. The idea of overloading the stomach never suggests itself to\r\ntheir minds. They suppose that the more food the young creature\r\nconsumes, the sooner it will be fat, and they allow it no exercise\r\nwhatever, for fear it should denude its very bones of their flesh. Under\r\nsuch circumstances, the stomach soon becomes deranged; its functions are\r\nno longer capable of acting; the milk, subjected to the acid of the\r\nstomach, coagulates, and forms a hardened mass of curd, when the muscles\r\nbecome affected with spasms, and death frequently ensues.\r\n\r\n853. THERE WAS NO SPECIES OF SLAUGHTERING practised in this country so\r\ninhuman and disgraceful as that, till very lately, employed in killing\r\nthis poor animal; when, under the plea of making the flesh _white_, the\r\ncalf was bled day by day, till, when the final hour came, the animal was\r\nunable to stand. This inhumanity is, we believe, now everywhere\r\nabolished, and the calf is at once killed, and with the least amount of\r\npain; a sharp-pointed knife is run through the neck, severing all the\r\nlarge veins and arteries up to the vertebrae. The skin is then taken off\r\nto the knee, which is disjointed, and to the head, which is removed; it\r\nis then reflected backwards, and the carcase having been opened and\r\ndressed, is kept apart by stretchers, and the thin membrane, the caul,\r\nextended over the organs left in the carcase, as the kidneys and\r\nsweet-bread; some melted fat is then scattered suddenly over the whole\r\ninterior, giving that white and frosted appearance to the meat, that is\r\nthought to add to its beauty; the whole is then hung up to cool and\r\nharden.\r\n\r\n854. THE MANNER OF CUTTING UP VEAL for the English market is to divide\r\nthe carcase into four quarters, with eleven ribs to each fore quarter;\r\nwhich are again subdivided into joints as exemplified on the cut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE OF A CALF, SHOWING THE SEVERAL JOINTS.]\r\n\r\n  _Hind quarter_:--\r\n\r\n    1. The loin.\r\n    2. The chump, consisting of the rump\r\n        and hock-bone.\r\n    3. The fillet.\r\n    4. The hock, or hind knuckle.\r\n\r\n  _Fore quarter_:--\r\n\r\n    5. The shoulder.\r\n    6. The neck.\r\n    7. The breast.\r\n    8. The fore knuckle.\r\n\r\n855. THE SEVERAL PARTS OF A MODERATELY-SIZED WELL-FED CALF, about eight\r\nweeks old, are nearly of the following weights:--loin and chump 18 lbs.,\r\nfillet 12-1/2 lbs., hind knuckle 5-1/2 lbs., shoulder 11 lbs, neck 11\r\nlbs., breast 9 lbs., and fore knuckle 5 lbs.; making a total of 144 lbs.\r\nweight. The London mode of cutting the carcase is considered better than\r\nthat pursued in Edinburgh, as giving three roasting joints, and one\r\nboiling, in each quarter; besides the pieces being more equally divided,\r\nas regards flesh, and from the handsomer appearance they make on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED VEAL (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n856. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of cold roast veal, a few slices of bacon, 1\r\npint of bread crumbs, 1/2 pint of good veal gravy, 1/2 teaspoonful of\r\nminced lemon-peel, 1 blade of pounded mace, cayenne and salt to taste, 4\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mince finely the veal and bacon; add the bread crumbs, gravy,\r\nand seasoning, and stir these ingredients well together. Beat up the\r\neggs thoroughly; add these, mix the whole well together, put into a\r\ndish, and bake from 3/4 to 1 hour. When liked, a little good gravy may\r\nbe served in a tureen as an accompaniment.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 3/4 to 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold meat, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST BREAST OF VEAL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREAST OF VEAL.]\r\n\r\n857. INGREDIENTS.--Veal; a little flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the veal, well wipe it, and dredge it with flour; put it\r\ndown to a bright fire, not too near, as it should not be scorched. Baste\r\nit plentifully until done; dish it, pour over the meat some good melted\r\nbutter, and send to table with it a piece of boiled bacon and a cut\r\nlemon.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 1-1/2 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8-1/2d. per lb. _Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED BREAST OF VEAL AND PEAS.\r\n\r\n858. INGREDIENTS.--Breast of veal, 2 oz. of butter, a bunch of savoury\r\nherbs, including parsley; 2 blades of pounded mace, 2 cloves, 5 or 6\r\nyoung onions, 1 strip of lemon-peel, 6 allspice, 1/4 teaspoonful of\r\npepper, 1 teaspoonful of salt, thickening of butter and flour, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of sherry, 2 tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce, 1\r\ntablespoonful of lemon-juice, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup,\r\ngreen peas.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the breast in half, after removing the bone underneath, and\r\ndivide the meat into convenient-sized pieces. Put the butter into a\r\nfrying-pan, lay in the pieces of veal, and fry until of a nice brown\r\ncolour. Now place these in a stewpan with the herbs, mace, cloves,\r\nonions, lemon-peel, allspice, and seasoning; pour over them just\r\nsufficient boiling water to cover the meat; well close the lid, and let\r\nthe whole simmer very gently for about 2 hours. Strain off as much gravy\r\nas is required, thicken it with butter and flour, add the remaining\r\ningredients, skim well, let it simmer for about 10 minutes, then pour it\r\nover the meat. Have ready some green peas, boiled separately; sprinkle\r\nthese over the veal, and serve. It may be garnished with forcemeat\r\nballs, or rashers of bacon curled and fried. Instead of cutting up the\r\nmeat, many persons prefer it dressed whole;--in that case it should be\r\nhalf-roasted before the water, &c. are put to it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/4 hours. _Average cost_, 8-1/2d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n    BREEDING OF CALVES.--The forwarding of calves to maturity,\r\n    whether intended to be reared for stock, or brought to an early\r\n    market as veal, is always a subject of great importance, and\r\n    requires a considerable amount of intelligence in the selection\r\n    of the best course, to adopt for either end. When meant to be\r\n    reared as stock, the breeding should be so arranged that the cow\r\n    shall calve about the middle of May. As our subject, however,\r\n    has more immediate reference to the calf as _meat_ than as\r\n    _stock_, we shall confine our remarks to the mode of procedure\r\n    adopted in the former case; and here, the first process adopted\r\n    is that of weaning; which consists in separating the calf\r\n    _entirely_ from the cow, but, at the same time, rearing it on\r\n    the mother's milk. As the business of the dairy would be\r\n    suspended if every cow were allowed to rear its young, and\r\n    butter, cheese, and cream become _desiderata_,--things to be\r\n    desired, but not possessed, a system of economical husbandry\r\n    becomes necessary, so as to retain our dairy produce, and yet,\r\n    for some weeks at least, nourish the calf on its mother's milk,\r\n    but without allowing the animal to draw that supply for itself:\r\n    this, with the proper substituted food on which to rear the\r\n    young animal, is called weaning.\r\n\r\nVEAL CAKE (a Convenient Dish for a Picnic).\r\n\r\n859. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of cold roast veal, a few slices of cold\r\nham, 2 hard-boiled eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, a little\r\npepper, good gravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut off all the brown outside from the veal, and cut the eggs\r\ninto slices. Procure a pretty mould; lay veal, ham, eggs, and parsley in\r\nlayers, with a little pepper between each, and when the mould is full,\r\nget some _strong_ stock, and fill up the shape. Bake for 1/2 hour, and\r\nwhen cold, turn it out.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED CALF'S FEET AND PARSLEY AND BUTTER.\r\n\r\n860. INGREDIENTS.--2 calf's feet, 2 slices of bacon, 2 oz. of butter, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, salt and whole pepper to taste, 1 onion,\r\na bunch of savoury herbs, 4 cloves, 1 blade of mace, water, parsley and\r\nbutter No. 493.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure 2 white calf's feet; bone them as far as the first\r\njoint, and put them into warm water to soak for 2 hours. Then put the\r\nbacon, butter, lemon-juice, onion, herbs, spices, and seasoning into a\r\nstewpan; lay in the feet, and pour in just sufficient water to cover the\r\nwhole. Stew gently for about 3 hours; take out the feet, dish them, and\r\ncover with parsley and butter, made by recipe No. 493. The liquor they\r\nwere boiled in should be strained and put by in a clean basin for use:\r\nit will be found very good as an addition to gravies, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 9d. each. _Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n    WHEN A CALF SHOULD BE KILLED.--The age at which a calf ought to\r\n    be killed should not be under four weeks: before that time the\r\n    flesh is certainly not wholesome, wanting firmness, due\r\n    development of muscular fibre, and those animal juices on which\r\n    the flavour and nutritive properties of the flesh depend,\r\n    whatever the unhealthy palate of epicures may deem to the\r\n    contrary. In France, a law exists to prevent the slaughtering of\r\n    calves under _six weeks_ of age. The calf is considered in prime\r\n    condition at ten weeks, when he will weigh from sixteen to\r\n    eighteen stone, and sometimes even twenty.\r\n\r\nFRICASSEED CALF'S FEET.\r\n\r\n861. INGREDIENTS.--A set of calf's feet; for the batter allow for each\r\negg 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 tablespoonful of bread crumbs, hot lard\r\nor clarified dripping, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--If the feet are purchased uncleaned, dip them into warm water\r\nrepeatedly, and scrape off the hair, first one foot and then the other,\r\nuntil the skin looks perfectly clean, a saucepan of water being kept by\r\nthe fire until they are finished. After washing and soaking in cold\r\nwater, boil them in just sufficient water to cover them, until the bones\r\ncome easily away. Then pick them out, and after straining the liquor\r\ninto a clean vessel, put the meat into a pie-dish until the next day.\r\nNow cut it down in slices about 1/2 inch thick, lay on them a stiff\r\nbatter made of egg, flour, and bread crumbs in the above proportion;\r\nseason with pepper and salt, and plunge them into a pan of boiling lard.\r\nFry the slices a nice brown, dry them before the fire for a minute or\r\ntwo, dish them on a napkin, and garnish with tufts of parsley. This\r\nshould be eaten with melted butter, mustard, and vinegar. Be careful to\r\nhave the lard boiling to set the batter, or the pieces of feet will run\r\nabout the pan. The liquor they were boiled in should be saved, and will\r\nbe found useful for enriching gravies, making jellies, &e. &e.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3 hours to stew the feet, 10 or 15 minutes to fry them.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 9d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This dish can be highly recommended to delicate persons.\r\n\r\n    COLOUR OF VEAL.--As whiteness of flesh is considered a great\r\n    advantage in veal, butchers, in the selection of their calves,\r\n    are in the habit of examining the inside of its mouth, and\r\n    noting the colour of the calf's eyes; alleging that, from the\r\n    signs they there see, they can prognosticate whether the veal\r\n    will be white or florid.\r\n\r\nCOLLARED CALF'S HEAD.\r\n\r\n862. INGREDIENTS.--A calf's head, 4 tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, 4\r\nblades of pounded mace, 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, white pepper\r\nto taste, a few thick slices of ham, the yolks of 6 eggs boiled hard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scald the head for a few minutes; take it out of the water, and\r\nwith a blunt knife scrape off all the hair. Clean it nicely, divide the\r\nhead and remove the brains. Boil it tender enough to take out the bones,\r\nwhich will be in about 2 hours. When the head is boned, flatten it on\r\nthe table, sprinkle over it a thick layer of parsley, then a layer of\r\nham, and then the yolks of the eggs cut into thin rings and put a\r\nseasoning of pounded mace, nutmeg, and white pepper between each layer;\r\nroll the head up in a cloth, and tie it up as tightly as possible. Boil\r\nit for 4 hours, and when it is taken out of the pot, place a heavy\r\nweight on the top, the same as for other collars. Let it remain till\r\ncold; then remove the cloth and binding, and it will be ready to serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 6 hours. _Average cost_, 5s. to 7s. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n    FEEDING A CALF.--The amount of milk necessary for a calf for\r\n    some time, will be about four quarts a day, though, after the\r\n    first fortnight, that quantity should be gradually increased,\r\n    according to its development of body, when, if fed exclusively\r\n    on milk, as much as three gallons a day will be requisite for\r\n    the due health and requirements of the animal. If the weather\r\n    is fine and genial, it should be turned into an orchard or small\r\n    paddock for a few hours each day, to give it an opportunity to\r\n    acquire a relish for the fresh pasture, which, by the tenth or\r\n    twelfth week, it will begin to nibble and enjoy. After a certain\r\n    time, the quantity of milk may be diminished, and its place\r\n    supplied by water thickened with meal. Hay-tea and linseed-jelly\r\n    are also highly nutritious substances, and may be used either as\r\n    adjuncts or substitutes.\r\n\r\nFRICASSEED CALF'S HEAD (an Entree).\r\n\r\n863. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of a boiled calf's head, 1-1/2 pint of\r\nthe liquor in which the head was boiled, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1\r\nonion minced, a bunch of savoury herbs, salt and white pepper to taste,\r\nthickening of butter and flour, the yolks of 2 eggs, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nlemon-juice, forcemeat balls.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Remove all the bones from the head, and cut the meat into nice\r\nsquare pieces. Put 1-1/2 pint of the liquor it was boiled in into a\r\nsaucepan, with mace, onion, herbs, and seasoning in the above\r\nproportion; let this simmer gently for 3/4 hour, then strain it and put\r\nin the meat. When quite hot through, thicken the gravy with a little\r\nbutter rolled in flour, and, just before dishing the fricassee, put in\r\nthe beaten yolks of eggs and lemon-juice; but be particular, after these\r\ntwo latter ingredients are added, that the sauce does not boil, or it\r\nwill curdle. Garnish with forcemeat balls and curled slices of broiled\r\nbacon. To insure the sauce being smooth, it is a good plan to dish the\r\nmeat first, and then to add the eggs to the gravy: when these are set,\r\nthe sauce may be poured over the meat.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1-1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 6d.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALF'S HEAD a la Maitre d'Hotel.\r\n\r\n864. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of a cold calf's head, rather more than\r\n1/2 pint of Maitre d'hôtel sauce No. 466.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the sauce by recipe No. 466, and have it sufficiently\r\nthick that it may nicely cover the meat; remove the bones from the head,\r\nand cut the meat into neat slices. When the sauce is ready, lay in the\r\nmeat; let it _gradually_ warm through, and, after it boils up, let it\r\nsimmer very gently for 5 minutes, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 1s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n    THE CALF IN AMERICA.--In America, the calf is left with the\r\n    mother for three or four days, when it is removed, and at once\r\n    fed on barley and oats ground together and made into a gruel, 1\r\n    quart of the meal being boiled for half an hour in 12 quarts of\r\n    water. One quart of this certainly nutritious gruel, is to be\r\n    given, lukewarm, morning and evening. In ten days, a bundle of\r\n    soft hay is put beside the calf, which he soon begins to eat,\r\n    and, at the same time, some of the dry meal is placed in his\r\n    manger for him to lick. This process, gradually increasing the\r\n    quantity of gruel twice a day, is continued for two months, till\r\n    the calf is fit to go to grass, and, as it is said, with the\r\n    best possible success. But, in this country, the mode pointed\r\n    out in No. 862 has received the sanction of the best experience.\r\n\r\nCURRIED VEAL (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n865. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast veal, 4 onions, 2 apples\r\nsliced, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1/2\r\npint of broth or water, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice the onions and apples, and fry them in a little butter;\r\nthen take them out, cut the meat into neat cutlets, and fry these of a\r\npale brown; add the curry-powder and flour, put in the onion, apples,\r\nand a little broth or water, and stew gently till quite tender; add the\r\nlemon-juice, and serve with an edging of boiled rice. The curry may be\r\nornamented with pickles, capsicums, and gherkins arranged prettily on\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 4d.\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEAL CUTLETS (an Entree).\r\n\r\n866. INGREDIENTS.--About 3 lbs. of the prime part of the leg of veal,\r\negg and bread crumbs, 3 tablespoonfuls of minced savoury herbs, salt and\r\npopper to taste, a small piece of butter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEAL CUTLETS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the veal cut into slices about 3/4 of an inch in\r\nthickness, and, if not cut perfectly even, level the meat with a\r\ncutlet-bat or rolling-pin. Shape and trim the cutlets, and brush them\r\nover with egg. Sprinkle with bread crumbs, with which have been mixed\r\nminced herbs and a seasoning of pepper and salt, and press the crumbs\r\ndown. Fry them of a delicate brown in fresh lard or butter, and be\r\ncareful not to burn them. They should be very thoroughly done, but not\r\ndry. If the cutlets be thick, keep the pan covered for a few minutes at\r\na good distance from the fire, after they have acquired a good colour:\r\nby this means, the meat will be done through. Lay the cutlets in a dish,\r\nkeep them hot, and make a gravy in the pan as follows: Dredge in a\r\nlittle flour, add a piece of butter the size of a walnut, brown it, then\r\npour as much boiling water as is required over it, season with pepper\r\nand salt, add a little lemon-juice, give one boil, and pour it over the\r\ncutlets. They should be garnished with slices of broiled bacon, and a\r\nfew forcemeat balls will be found a very excellent addition to this\r\ndish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--For cutlets of a moderate thickness, about 12 minutes; if very\r\nthick, allow more time.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. per lb. _Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Veal cutlets may be merely floured and fried of a nice brown;\r\nthe gravy and garnishing should be the same as in the preceding recipe.\r\nThey may also be cut from the loin or neck, as shown in the engraving.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED VEAL CUTLETS a l'Italienne (an Entree).\r\n\r\n867. INGREDIENTS.--Neck of veal, salt and pepper to taste, the yolk of 1\r\negg, bread crumbs, 1/2 pint of Italian sauce No. 453.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the veal into cutlets, flatten and trim them nicely; powder\r\nover them a little salt and pepper; brush them over with the yolk of an\r\negg, dip them into bread crumbs, then into clarified butter, and,\r\nafterwards, in the bread crumbs again; broil or fry them over a clear\r\nfire, that they may acquire a good brown colour.

The young bloods of this\r\n    school, however, who were compelled to mingle in the world, yet\r\n    detesting the politics which had become the fashion, adopted a\r\n    novel expedient to keep alive their republican sentiments, and\r\n    mark their contempt of the reigning family. They accordingly\r\n    met, in considerable numbers, at some convenient inn, on the\r\n    30th of January in each year,--the anniversary of Charles's\r\n    death, and dined together off a feast prepared from _calves'\r\n    heads_, dressed in every possible variety of way, and with an\r\n    abundance of wine drank toasts of defiance and hatred to the\r\n    house of Stuart, and glory to the memory of old Holl Cromwell;\r\n    and having lighted a large bonfire in the yard, the club of fast\r\n    young Puritans, with their white handkerchiefs stained _red_ in\r\n    wine, and one of the party in a mask, bearing an axe, followed\r\n    by the chairman, carrying a _calf's head_ pinned up in a napkin,\r\n    marched in mock procession to the bonfire, into which, with\r\n    great shouts and uproar, they flung the enveloped head. This odd\r\n    custom was continued for some time, and even down to the early\r\n    part of this century it was customary for men of republican\r\n    politics always to dine off calf's head on the 30th of January.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEAL CUTLETS a la Maintenon (an Entree).\r\n\r\n868. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 lbs. of veal cutlets, egg and bread crumbs, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of minced savoury herbs, salt and pepper to taste, a\r\nlittle grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the cutlets about 3/4 inch in thickness, flatten them, and\r\nbrush them over with the yolk of an egg; dip them into bread crumbs and\r\nminced herbs, season with pepper and salt and grated nutmeg, and fold\r\neach cutlet in a piece of buttered paper. Broil them, and send them to\r\ntable with melted butter or a good gravy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 15 to 18 minutes. _Average cost_, 10d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEAL A LA BOURGEOISE.\r\n\r\n(_Excellent_.)\r\n\r\n869.

Add the bacon, carrots, onions, spice,\r\nherbs, and seasoning; pour in about a pint of boiling water, and stew\r\ngently for 2 hours on a very slow fire. When done, skim off the fat,\r\ntake out the herbs, and flavour the gravy with a little tomato sauce and\r\nketchup. Have ready the peas and potatoes, boiled _separately_; put them\r\nwith the veal, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 2s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to August with peas;--rather earlier when these\r\nare omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOTCH COLLOPS (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n870.

Forcemeat balls may be added to this dish. If cream is not at\r\nhand, substitute the yolk of an egg beaten up well with a little milk.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 5 or 7 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from May to October.\r\n\r\n    COOKING COLLOPS.--Dean Ramsay, who tells us, in his\r\n    \"Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character,\" a number of\r\n    famous stories of the strong-headed, warm-hearted, and\r\n    plain-spoken old dames of the north, gives, amongst them, the\r\n    following:--A strong-minded lady of this class was inquiring the\r\n    character of a cook she was about to hire. The lady who was\r\n    giving the character entered a little upon the cook's moral\r\n    qualifications, and described her as a very decent woman; to\r\n    which the astounding reply--this was 60 years ago, and a Dean\r\n    tells the story--\"Oh, d--n her decency; can she make good\r\n    collops?\"\r\n\r\nROAST FILLET OF VEAL.\r\n\r\n872. INGREDIENTS.--Veal, forcemeat No. 417, melted butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the fillet cut according to the size required; take out\r\nthe bone, and after raising the skin from the meat, put under the flap a\r\nnice forcemeat, made by recipe No. 417. Prepare sufficient of this, as\r\nthere should be some left to eat cold, and to season and flavour a mince\r\nif required. Skewer and bind the veal up in a round form; dredge well\r\nwith flour, put it down at some distance from the fire at first, and\r\nbaste continually. About 1/2 hour before serving, draw it nearer the\r\nfire, that it may acquire more colour, as the outside should be of a\r\nrich brown, but not burnt. Dish it, remove the skewers, which replace by\r\na silver one; pour over the joint some good melted butter, and serve\r\nwith either boiled ham, bacon, or pickled pork. Never omit to send a cut\r\nlemon to table with roast veal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FILLET OF VEAL.]\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A fillet of veal weighing 12 lbs., about 4 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 9 or 10 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED FILLET OF VEAL.\r\n\r\n873. INGREDIENTS.--A small fillet of veal, forcemeat No. 417, thickening\r\nof butter and flour, a few mushrooms, white pepper to taste, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1/2 glass of\r\nsherry.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--If the whole of the leg is purchased, take off the knuckle to\r\nstew, and also the square end, which will serve for cutlets or pies.\r\nRemove the bone, and fill the space with a forcemeat No. 417. Roll and\r\nskewer it up firmly; place a few skewers at the bottom of a stewpan to\r\nprevent the meat from sticking, and cover the veal with a little weak\r\nstock. Let it simmer very _gently_ until tender, as the more slowly veal\r\nis stewed, the better. Strain and thicken the sauce, flavour it with\r\nlemon-juice, mace, sherry, and white pepper; give one boil, and pour it\r\nover the meat. The skewers should be removed, and replaced by a silver\r\none, and the dish garnished with slices of cut lemon.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A. fillet of veal weighing 6 lbs., 3 hours' very gentle\r\nstewing.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN CALF.--We are told in the book of Genesis, that Aaron, in the\r\nlengthened absence of Moses, was constrained by the impatient people to\r\nmake them an image to worship; and that Aaron, instead of using his\r\ndelegated power to curb this sinful expression of the tribes, and\r\nappease the discontented Jews, at once complied with their demand, and,\r\ntelling them to bring to him their rings and trinkets, fashioned out of\r\ntheir willing contributions a calf of gold, before which the multitude\r\nfell down and worshipped. Whether this image was a solid figure of gold,\r\nor a wooden effigy merely, coated with metal, is uncertain. To suppose\r\nthe former,--knowing the size of the image made from such trifling\r\narticles as rings, we must presuppose the Israelites to have spoiled the\r\nEgyptians most unmercifully: the figure, however, is of more consequence\r\nthan the weight or size of the idol. That the Israelite brought away\r\nmore from Goshen than the plunder of the Egyptians, and that they were\r\ndeeply imbued with Egyptian superstition, the golden calf is only one,\r\nout of many instances of proof; for a gilded ox, covered with a pall,\r\nwas in that country an emblem of Osiris, one of the gods of the Egyptian\r\ntrinity. Besides having a sacred cow, and many varieties of the holy\r\nbull, this priest-ridden people worshipped the ox as a symbol of the\r\nsun, and offered to it divine honours, as the emblem of frugality,\r\nindustry, and husbandry. It is therefore probable that, in borrowing so\r\nfamiliar a type, the Israelites, in their calf-worship, meant, under a\r\nwell-understood cherubic symbol, to acknowledge the full force of those\r\nvirtues, under an emblem of divine power and goodness. The prophet Hosea\r\nis full of denunciations against calf-worship in Israel, and alludes to\r\nthe custom of kissing these idols, Hosea, viii, 4-6.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRICANDEAU OF VEAL (an Entree).\r\n\r\n874. INGREDIENTS.--A piece of the fat side of a leg of veal (about 3\r\nlbs.), lardoons, 2 carrots, 2 large onions, a faggot of savoury herbs, 2\r\nblades of pounded mace, 6 whole allspice, 2 bay-leaves, pepper to taste,\r\na few slices of fat bacon, 1 pint of stock No. 107.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRICANDEAU OF VEAL.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--The veal for a fricandeau should be of the best quality, or it\r\nwill not be good. It may be known by the meat being white and not\r\nthready. Take off the skin, flatten the veal on the table, then at one\r\nstroke of the knife, cut off as much as is required, for a fricandeau\r\nwith an uneven surface never looks well. Trim it, and with a sharp knife\r\nmake two or three slits in the middle, that it may taste more of the\r\nseasoning. Now lard it thickly with fat bacon, as lean gives a red\r\ncolour to the fricandeau. Slice the vegetables, and put these, with the\r\nherbs and spices, in the _middle_ of a stewpan, with a few slices of\r\nbacon at the top: these should form a sort of mound in the centre for\r\nthe veal to rest upon. Lay the fricandeau over the bacon, sprinkle over\r\nit a little salt, and pour in just sufficient stock to cover the bacon,\r\n&c., without touching the veal. Let it gradually come to a boil; then\r\nput it over a slow and equal fire, and let it _simmer very_ gently for\r\nabout 2-1/2 hours, or longer should it be very large. Baste it\r\nfrequently with the liquor, and a short time before serving, put it into\r\na brisk oven, to make the bacon firm, which otherwise would break when\r\nit was glazed. Dish the fricandeau, keep it hot, skim off the fat from\r\nthe liquor, and reduce it quickly to a glaze, with which glaze the\r\nfricandeau, and serve with a purée of whatever vegetable happens to be\r\nin season--spinach, sorrel, asparagus, cucumbers, peas, &c.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 hours. If very large, allow more time.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for an entrée.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRICANDEAU OF VEAL (_More economical_.)\r\n\r\n875. INGREDIENTS.--The best end of a neck of veal (about 2-1/2 lbs.),\r\nlardoons, 2 carrots, 2 onions, a faggot of savoury herbs, 2 blades of\r\nmace, 2 bay-leaves, a little whole white pepper, a few slices of fat\r\nbacon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut away the lean part of the best end of a neck of veal with a\r\nsharp knife, scooping it from the bones. Put the bones in with a little\r\nwater, which will serve to moisten the fricandeau: they should stew\r\nabout 1-1/2 hour. Lard the veal, proceed in the same way as in the\r\npreceding recipe, and be careful that the gravy does not touch the\r\nfricandeau. Stew very gently for 3 hours; glaze, and serve it on sorrel,\r\nspinach, or with a little gravy in the dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for an entrée.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--When the prime part of the leg is cut off, it spoils the whole;\r\nconsequently, to use this for a fricandeau is rather extravagant. The\r\nbest end of the neck answers the purpose nearly or quite as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED CALF'S HEAD (with the Skin on).\r\n\r\n876. INGREDIENTS.--Calf's head, boiling water, bread crumbs, 1 large\r\nbunch of parsley, butter, white pepper and salt to taste, 4\r\ntablespoonfuls of melted butter, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 2 or 3\r\ngrains of cayenne.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the head into boiling water, and let it remain by the side\r\nof the fire for 3 or 4 minutes; take it out, hold it by the ear, and\r\nwith the back of a knife, scrape off the hair (should it not come off\r\neasily, dip the head again into boiling water). When perfectly clean,\r\ntake the eyes out, cut off the ears, and remove the brain, which soak\r\nfor an hour in warm water. Put the head into hot water to soak for a few\r\nminutes, to make it look white, and then have ready a stewpan, into\r\nwhich lay the head; cover it with cold water, and bring it gradually to\r\nboil. Remove the scum, and add a little salt, which assists to throw it\r\nup. Simmer it very gently from 2-1/2 to 3 hours, and when nearly done,\r\nboil the brains for 1/4 hour; skin and chop them, not too finely, and\r\nadd a tablespoonful of minced parsley which has been previously scalded.\r\nSeason with pepper and salt, and stir the brains, parsley, &c., into\r\nabout 4 tablespoonfuls of melted butter; add the lemon-juice and\r\ncayenne, and keep these hot by the side of the fire. Take up the head,\r\ncut out the tongue, skin it, put it on a small dish with the brains\r\nround it; sprinkle over the head a few bread crumbs mixed with a little\r\nminced parsley; brown these before the fire, and serve with a tureen of\r\nparsley and butter, and either boiled bacon, ham, or pickled pork as an\r\naccompaniment.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 to 3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, according to the season, from 3s. to 7s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 or 9 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED CALF'S HEAD (without the Skin).\r\n\r\n877. INGREDIENTS.--Calf's head, water, a little salt, 4 tablespoonfuls\r\nof melted butter, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, pepper and salt to\r\ntaste, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALF'S HEAD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HALF A CALF'S HEAD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--After the head has been thoroughly cleaned, and the brains\r\nremoved, soak it in warm water to blanch it. Lay the brains also into\r\nwarm water to soak, and let them remain for about an hour. Put the head\r\ninto a stewpan, with sufficient cold water to cover it, and when it\r\nboils, add a little salt; take off every particle of scum as it rises,\r\nand boil the head until perfectly tender. Boil the brains, chop them,\r\nand mix with them melted butter, minced parsley, pepper, salt, and\r\nlemon-juice in the above proportion. Take up the head, skin the tongue,\r\nand put it on a small dish with the brains round it. Have ready some\r\nparsley and butter, smother the head with it, and the remainder send to\r\ntable in a tureen. Bacon, ham, pickled pork, or a pig's cheek, are\r\nindispensable with calf's head. The brains are sometimes chopped with\r\nhard-boiled eggs, and mixed with a little Béchamel or white sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, according to the season, from 3s. to 5s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The liquor in which the head was boiled should be saved: it\r\nmakes excellent soup, and will be found a nice addition to gravies, &c.\r\nHalf a calf's head is as frequently served as a whole one, it being a\r\nmore convenient-sized joint for a small family. It is cooked in the same\r\nmanner, and served with the same sauces, as in the preceding recipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHASHED CALF'S HEAD (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n878. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of a cold boiled calf's head, 1 quart of\r\nthe liquor in which it was boiled, a faggot of savoury herbs, 1 onion, 1\r\ncarrot, a strip of lemon-peel, 2 blades of pounded mace, salt and white\r\npepper to taste, a very little cayenne, rather more than 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of sherry, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1\r\ntablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, forcemeat balls.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the meat into neat slices, and put the bones and trimmings\r\ninto a stewpan with the above proportion of liquor that the head was\r\nboiled in. Add a bunch of savoury herbs, 1 onion, 1 carrot, a strip of\r\nlemon-peel, and 2 blades of pounded mace, and let these boil for 1 hour,\r\nor until the gravy is reduced nearly half. Strain it into a clean\r\nstewpan, thicken it with a little butter and flour, and add a flavouring\r\nof sherry, lemon-juice, and ketchup, in the above proportion; season\r\nwith pepper, salt, and a little cayenne; put in the meat, let it\r\n_gradually_ warm through, but not boil more than _two_ or _three_\r\nminutes. Garnish the dish with forcemeat balls and pieces of bacon\r\nrolled and toasted, placed alternately, and send it to table very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the remains of the head, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEAL COLLOPS (an Entree).\r\n\r\n879.

Skewer each one firmly, egg and bread crumb them, and fry\r\nthem a nice brown in a little butter, turning them occasionally, and\r\nshaking the pan about. When done, place them on a dish before the fire;\r\nput a small piece of butter in the pan, dredge in a little flour, add\r\n1/4 pint of water, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, a seasoning of salt,\r\npepper, and pounded mace; let the whole boil up, and pour it over the\r\ncollops.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 10 to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALF'S LIVER AUX FINES HERBES & SAUCE PIQUANTE.\r\n\r\n880.

Fry the liver in the fat which comes from the bacon,\r\nafter seasoning it with pepper and salt and dredging over it a very\r\nlittle flour. Turn the liver occasionally to prevent its burning, and\r\nwhen done, lay it round the dish with a piece of bacon between each.\r\nPour away the bacon fat, put in a small piece of butter, dredge in a\r\nlittle flour, add the lemon-juice and water, give one boil, and pour it\r\nin the _middle_ of the dish.

INGREDIENTS.--A small fillet of veal, 1 pint of Béchamel sauce No.\r\n367, a few bread crumbs, clarified butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--A fillet of real that has been roasted the preceding day will\r\nanswer very well for this dish. Cut the middle out rather deep, leaving\r\na good margin round, from which to cut nice slices, and if there should\r\nbe any cracks in the veal, fill them up with forcemeat. Mince finely the\r\nmeat that was taken out, mixing with it a little of the forcemeat to\r\nflavour, and stir to it sufficient Béchamel to make it of a proper\r\nconsistency. Warm the veal in the oven for about an hour, taking care to\r\nbaste it well, that it may not be dry; put the mince in the place where\r\nthe meat was taken out, sprinkle a few bread crumbs over it, and drop a\r\nlittle clarified butter on the bread crumbs; put it into the oven for\r\n1/4 hour to brown, and pour Béchamel round the sides of the dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RAGOUT A KNUCKLE OF VEAL.\r\n\r\n884.

Let it gradually come to a boil, put in\r\nthe salt, and remove the scum as fast as it rises. When it has simmered\r\ngently for about 3/4 hour, add the remaining ingredients, and stew the\r\nwhole gently for 2-1/4 hours.

Keep it well basted, and a short time before\r\nserving, remove the paper from the kidney, and allow it to acquire a\r\nnice brown colour, but it should not be burnt. Have ready some melted\r\nbutter, put it into the dripping-pan after it is emptied of its\r\ncontents, pour it over the veal, and serve. Garnish the dish with slices\r\nof lemon and forcemeat balls, and send to table with it, boiled bacon,\r\nham, pickled pork, or pig's cheek.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A large loin, 3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9-1/2d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A piece of toast should be placed under the kidney when the\r\nveal is dished.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOIN OF VEAL AU BECHAMEL (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n887.

In the mean time, wrap the joint in buttered\r\npaper, and place it in the oven to warm. When thoroughly hot, dish the\r\nmince, place the loin above it, and pour over the remainder of the\r\nBéchamel.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour to warm the meat in the oven.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOIN OF VEAL, a la Daube.\r\n\r\n888.

The calf being a type or symbol of Divine\r\n    power, or what was called the _Elohim_,--the Almighty\r\n    intelligence that brought them out of Egypt,--was looked upon\r\n    much in the same light by the Jews, as the cross subsequently\r\n    was by the Christians, a mystical emblem of the Divine passion\r\n    and goodness. Consequently, an oath taken on either the calf or\r\n    the cross was considered equally solemn and sacred by Jew or\r\n    Nazarene, and the breaking of it a soul-staining perjury on\r\n    themselves, and an insult and profanation directly offered to\r\n    the Almighty. To render the oath more impressive and solemn, it\r\n    was customary to slaughter a dedicated calf in the temple, when,\r\n    the priests having divided the carcase into a certain number of\r\n    parts, and with intervening spaces, arranged the severed limbs\r\n    on the marble pavement, the one, or all the party, if there were\r\n    many individuals, to be bound by the oath, repeating the words\r\n    of the compact, threaded their way in and out through the\r\n    different spaces, till they had taken the circuit of each\r\n    portion of the divided calf, when the ceremony was concluded. To\r\n    avert the anger of the Lord, when Jerusalem was threatened by\r\n    Nebuchadnezzar and his Babylonian host, the Jews had made a\r\n    solemn to God, ratified by the ceremony of the calf, if He\r\n    released them from their dreaded foe, to cancel the servitude of\r\n    their Hebrew brethren. After investing the city for some time,\r\n    and reducing the inhabitants to dreadful suffering and\r\n    privation, the Babylonians, hearing that Pharaoh, whom the Jews\r\n    had solicited for aid, was rapidly approaching with a powerful\r\n    army, hastily raised the siege, and, removing to a distance,\r\n    took up a position where they could intercept the Egyptians, and\r\n    still cover the city. No sooner did the Jews behold the retreat\r\n    of the enemy, than they believed all danger was past, and, with\r\n    their usual turpitude, they repudiated their oath, and refused\r\n    to liberate their oppressed countrymen. For this violation of\r\n    their covenant with the Lord, they were given over to all the\r\n    horrors of the sword, pestilence, and famine--Jeremiah, xxxiv.\r\n    15-17.\r\n\r\nMINCED VEAL AND MACARONI.\r\n\r\n(_A pretty side or corner dish_.)\r\n\r\n891. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of minced cold roast veal, 3 oz. of ham, 1\r\ntablespoonful of gravy, pepper and salt to taste, 3 teaspoonful of\r\ngrated nutmeg, 1/4 lb. of bread crumbs, 1/4 lb. of macaroni, 1 or 2 eggs\r\nto bind, a small piece of butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut some nice slices from a cold fillet of veal, trim off the\r\nbrown outside, and mince the meat finely with the above proportion of\r\nham: should the meat be very dry, add a spoonful of good gravy. Season\r\nhighly with pepper and salt, add the grated nutmeg and bread crumbs, and\r\nmix these ingredients with 1 or 2 eggs well beaten, which should bind\r\nthe mixture and make it like forcemeat. In the mean time, boil the\r\nmacaroni in salt and water, and drain it; butter a mould, put some of\r\nthe macaroni at the bottom and sides of it, in whatever form is liked;\r\nmix the remainder with the forcemeat, fill the mould up to the top, put\r\na plate or small dish on it, and steam for 1/2 hour. Turn it out\r\ncarefully, and serve with good gravy poured round, but not over, the\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the cold meat, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--To make a variety, boil some carrots and turnips separately in\r\na little salt and water; when done, cut them into pieces about 1/8 inch\r\nin thickness; butter an oval mould, and place these in it, in white and\r\nred stripes alternately, at the bottom and sides.

Butter a shape, put in the meat, and hake for 3/4 hour; turn it\r\nout of the mould carefully, and pour round it a good brown gravy. A\r\nsheep's head dressed in this manner is an economical and savoury dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the meat, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAISED NECK OF VEAL.\r\n\r\n893.

Stew it gently for 2 hours, or\r\nuntil it is quite tender; strain off the liquor; stir together over the\r\nfire, in a stewpan, a little flour and butter until brown; lay the veal\r\nin this, the upper side to the bottom of the pan, and let it remain till\r\nof a nice brown colour. Place it in the dish; pour into the stewpan as\r\nmuch gravy as is required, boil it up, skim well, add the wine, pounded\r\nmace, and lemon-juice; simmer for 3 minutes, pour it over the meat, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n    BIRTH OF CALVES.--The cow seldom produces more than a single\r\n    calf; sometimes, twins, and, very rarely, three. A French\r\n    newspaper, however,--the \"Nouveau Bulletin des Sciences,\"--gave\r\n    a trustworthy but extraordinary account of a cow which produced\r\n    nine calves in all, at three successive births, in three\r\n    successive years. The first year, four cow calves; the second\r\n    year, three calves, two of them females; the third year, two\r\n    calves, both females.

They may be also\r\nbaked in patty-pans: in that case, they should be brushed over with the\r\nyolk of an egg before they are put in the oven. To make a variety,\r\noysters may be substituted for the ham.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 minutes to fry the patties.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEAL PIE.\r\n\r\n897.

The judge, observing the surprise of his\r\n    guests, volunteered an explanation.--\"Oh, ay, it's a' cauf;\r\n    when we kill a beast, we just eat up ae side, and doun the\r\n    tither.\"\r\n\r\nVEAL AND HAM PIE.\r\n\r\n898. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of veal cutlets, 1/2 lb. of boiled ham, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of minced savoury herbs, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated\r\nnutmeg, 2 blades of pounded mace, pepper and salt to taste, a strip of\r\nlemon-peel finely minced, the yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, 1/2 pint of\r\nwater, nearly 1/2 pint of good strong gravy, puff-crust.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the veal into nice square pieces, and put a layer of them\r\nat the bottom of a pie-dish; sprinkle over these a portion of the herbs,\r\nspices, seasoning, lemon-peel, and the yolks of the eggs cut in slices;\r\ncut the ham very thin, and put a layer of this in. Proceed in this\r\nmanner until the dish is full, so arranging it that the ham comes at the\r\ntop. Lay a puff-paste on the edge of the dish, and pour in about 1/2\r\npint of water; cover with crust, ornament it with leaves, brush it over\r\nwith the yolk of an egg, and bake in a well-heated oven for 1 to 1-1/2\r\nhour, or longer, should the pie be very large. When it is taken out of\r\nthe oven, pour in at the top, through a funnel, nearly 1/2 pint of\r\nstrong gravy: this should be made sufficiently good that, when cold, it\r\nmay cut in a firm jelly. This pie may be very much enriched by adding a\r\nfew mushrooms, oysters, or sweetbreads; but it will be found very good\r\nwithout any of the last-named additions.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour, or longer, should the pie be very large. _Average\r\ncost_, 3s. _Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ from March to\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTTED VEAL (for Breakfast).\r\n\r\n899.

If kept in a cool\r\nplace, it will remain good some days.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n    NAMES OF CALVES, &c.--During the time the young male calf is\r\n    suckled by his mother, he is called a bull-or ox-calf; when\r\n    turned a year old, he is called a stirk, stot, or yearling; on\r\n    the completion of his second year, he is called a two-year-old\r\n    bull or steer (and in some counties a twinter); then, a\r\n    three-year-old steer; and at four, an ox or a bullock, which\r\n    latter names are retained till death. It may be here remarked,\r\n    that the term ox is used as a general or common appellation for\r\n    neat cattle, in a specific sense, and irrespective of sex; as\r\n    the British ox, the Indian ox. The female is termed cow, but\r\n    while sucking the mother, a cow-calf; at the age of a year, she\r\n    is called a yearling quey; in another year, a heifer, or\r\n    twinter; then, a three-year-old quey or twinter; and, at four\r\n    years old, a cow. Other names, to be regarded as provincialisms,\r\n    may exist in different districts.\r\n\r\nRAGOUT OF COLD VEAL (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n900.

Serve with mushroom sauce or brown gravy.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes to fry the rolls.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOULDER OF VEAL, Stuffed and Stewed.\r\n\r\n903. INGREDIENTS.--A shoulder of veal, a few slices of ham or bacon,\r\nforcemeat No. 417, 3 carrots, 2 onions, salt and pepper to taste, a\r\nfaggot of savoury herbs, 3 blades of pounded mace, water, thickening of\r\nbutter and flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Bone the joint by carefully detaching the meat from the\r\nblade-bone on one side, and then on the other, being particular not to\r\npierce the skin; then cut the bone from the knuckle, and take it out.\r\nFill the cavity whence the bone was taken with a forcemeat made by\r\nrecipe No. 417. Roll and bind the veal up tightly; put it into a\r\nstew-pan with the carrots, onions, seasoning, herbs, and mace; pour in\r\njust sufficient water to cover it, and let it stew _very gently_ for\r\nabout 5 hours. Before taking it up, try if it is properly done by\r\nthrusting a larding-needle in it: if it penetrates easily, it is\r\nsufficiently cooked. Strain and skim the gravy, thicken with butter and\r\nflour, give one boil, and pour it round the meat. A few young carrots\r\nmay be boiled and placed round the dish as a garnish, and, when in\r\nseason, green peas should always be served with this dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 hours. _Average cost_, 7d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 or 9 persons. _Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n    THE FATTENING OF CALVES.--The fattening of calves for the market\r\n    is an important business in Lanarkshire or Clydesdale, and\r\n    numbers of newly-dropped calves are regularly carried there from\r\n    the farmers of the adjacent districts, in order to be prepared\r\n    for the butcher. The mode of feeding them is very simple; milk\r\n    is the chief article of their diet, and of this the calves\r\n    require a sufficient supply from first to last. Added to this,\r\n    they must be kept in a well-aired place, neither too hot nor too\r\n    cold, and freely supplied with dry litter. It is usual to\r\n    exclude the light,--at all events to a great degree, and to put\r\n    within their reach a lump of chalk, which they are very fond of\r\n    licking. Thus fed, calves, at the end of 8 or 9 weeks, often\r\n    attain a very large size; viz., 18 to 20 stone, exclusive of the\r\n    offal. Far heavier weights have occurred, and without any\r\n    deterioration in the delicacy and richness of the flesh. This\r\n    mode of feeding upon milk alone at first appears to be very\r\n    expensive, but it is not so, when all things are taken into\r\n    consideration; for at the age of 9 or 10 weeks a calf,\r\n    originally purchased for 8 shillings, will realize nearly the\r\n    same number of pounds. For 4, or even 6 weeks, the milk of one\r\n    cow is sufficient,--indeed half that quantity is enough for the\r\n    first fortnight; but after the 5th or 6th week it will consume\r\n    the greater portion of the milk of two moderate cows; but then\r\n    it requires neither oil-cake nor linseed, nor any other food.\r\n    Usually, however, the calves are not kept beyond the age of 6\r\n    weeks, and will then sell for 5 or 6 pounds each: the milk of\r\n    the cow is then ready for a successor. In this manner a relay of\r\n    calves may be prepared for the markets from early spring to the\r\n    end of summer, a plan more advantageous than that of overfeeding\r\n    one to a useless degree of corpulency.\r\n\r\nVEAL SAUSAGES.\r\n\r\n904. INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of fat bacon and lean veal; to every\r\nlb. of meat, allow 1 teaspoonful of minced sage, salt and pepper to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the meat and bacon finely, and to every lb. allow the\r\nabove proportion of very finely-minced sage; add a seasoning of pepper\r\nand salt, mix the whole well together, make it into flat cakes, and fry\r\na nice brown.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED VEAL, with Peas, young Carrots, and new Potatoes.\r\n\r\n905. INGREDIENTS.--3 or 4 lbs. of the loin or neck of veal, 15 young\r\ncarrots, a few green onions, 1 pint of green peas, 12 new potatoes, a\r\nbunch of savoury herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nlemon-juice, 2 tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\nmushroom ketchup.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Dredge the meat with flour, and roast or bake it for about 3/4\r\nhour: it should acquire a nice brown colour. Put the meat into a stewpan\r\nwith the carrots, onions, potatoes, herbs, pepper, and salt; pour over\r\nit sufficient boiling water to cover it, and stew gently for 2 hours.\r\nTake out the meat and herbs, put it in a deep dish, skim off all the fat\r\nfrom the gravy, and flavour it with lemon-juice, tomato sauce, and\r\nmushroom ketchup in the above proportion. Have ready a pint of green\r\npeas boiled; put these with the meat, pour over it the gravy, and\r\nserve. The dish may be garnished with a few forcemeat balls. The meat,\r\nwhen preferred, may be cut into chops, and floured and fried instead of\r\nbeing roasted; and any part of veal dressed in this way will be found\r\nextremely savoury and good.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours. _Average cost_, 9d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_, with peas, from June to August.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED SWEETBREADS (an Entree).\r\n\r\n906. INGREDIENTS.--3 sweetbreads, egg and bread crumbs, oiled butter, 3\r\nslices of toast, brown gravy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWEETBREADS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose large white sweetbreads; put them into warm water to\r\ndraw out the blood, and to improve their colour; let them remain for\r\nrather more than 1 hour; then put them into boiling water, and allow\r\nthem to simmer for about 10 minutes, which renders them firm. Take them\r\nup, drain them, brush over with egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs; dip\r\nthem in egg again, and then into more bread crumbs. Drop on them a\r\nlittle oiled butter, and put the sweetbreads into a moderately-heated\r\noven, and let them bake for nearly 3/4 hour. Make 3 pieces of toast;\r\nplace the sweetbreads on the toast, and pour round, but not over them, a\r\ngood brown gravy.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To soak 1 hour, to be boiled 10 minutes, baked 40 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. to 5s. _Sufficient_ for an entrée.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--In full season from May to August.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED SWEETBREADS a la Maitre d'Hotel (an Entree).\r\n\r\n907. INGREDIENTS.--3 sweetbreads, egg and bread crumbs, 1/4 lb. of\r\nbutter, salt and pepper to taste, rather more than 1/2 pint of Maître\r\nd'hôtel sauce No. 466.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Soak the sweetbreads in warm water for an hour; then boil them\r\nfor 10 minutes; cut them in slices, egg and bread crumb them, season\r\nwith pepper and salt, and put them into a frying-pan, with the above\r\nproportion of butter. Keep turning them until done, which will be in\r\nabout 10 minutes; dish them, and pour over them a Maître d'hôtel sauce,\r\nmade by recipe No. 466. The dish may be garnished with slices of cut\r\nlemon.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To soak 1 hour, to be broiled 10 minutes, to be fried about 10\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. to 5s., according to the season.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for an entrée.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--In full season from May to August.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The egg and bread crumb may be omitted, and the slices of\r\nsweetbread dredged with a little flour instead, and a good gravy may be\r\nsubstituted for the _maitre d'hôtel_ sauce. This is a very simple method\r\nof dressing them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED SWEETBREADS (an Entree).\r\n\r\n908. INGREDIENTS.--3 sweetbreads, 1 pint of white stock No. 107,\r\nthickening of butter and flour, 6 tablespoonfuls of cream, 1\r\ntablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1 blade of pounded mace, white pepper and\r\nsalt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Soak the sweetbreads in warm water for 1 hour, and boil them\r\nfor 10 minutes; take them out, put them into cold water for a few\r\nminutes; lay them in a stewpan with the stock, and simmer them gently\r\nfor rather more than 1/2 hour. Dish them; thicken the gravy with a\r\nlittle butter and flour; let it boil up, add the remaining ingredients,\r\nallow the sauce to get quite _hot_, but _not boil_, and pour it over the\r\nsweetbreads.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To soak 1 hour, to be boiled 10 minutes, stewed rather more\r\nthan 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 1s. to 5s., according to the season.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for an entrée.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--In full season from May to August.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A few mushrooms added to this dish, and stewed with the\r\nsweetbreads, will be found an improvement.\r\n\r\n    SEASON AND CHOICE OF VEAL.--Veal, like all other meats, has its\r\n    season of plenty. The best veal, and the largest supply, are to\r\n    be had from March to the end of July. It comes principally from\r\n    the western counties, and is generally of the Alderney breed. In\r\n    purchasing veal, its whiteness and fineness of grain should be\r\n    considered, the colour being especially of the utmost\r\n    consequence. Veal may be bought at all times of the year and of\r\n    excellent quality, but is generally very dear, except in the\r\n    months of plenty.\r\n\r\nSTEWED TENDRONS DE VEAU (an Entree).\r\n\r\n909. INGREDIENTS.--The gristles from 2 breasts of veal, stock No. 107, 1\r\nfaggot of savoury herbs, 2 blades of pounded mace, 4 cloves, 2 carrots,\r\n2 onions, a strip of lemon-peel.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--The _tendrons_ or gristles, which are found round the front of\r\na breast of veal, are now very frequently served as an entrée, and when\r\nwell dressed, make a nice and favourite dish. Detach the gristles from\r\nthe bone, and cut them neatly out, so as not to spoil the joint for\r\nroasting or stewing. Put them into a stewpan, with sufficient stock, No.\r\n107, to cover them; add the herbs, mace, cloves, carrots, onions, and\r\nlemon, and simmer these for nearly, or quite, 4 hours. They should be\r\nstewed until a fork will enter the meat easily. Take them up, drain\r\nthem, strain the gravy, boil it down to a glaze, with which glaze the\r\nmeat. Dish the _tendrons_ in a circle, with croûtons fried of a nice\r\ncolour placed between each; and put mushroom sauce, or a purée of green\r\npeas or tomatoes, in the middle.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 hours. _Sufficient_ for one entrée.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--With peas, from June to August.\r\n\r\n    COW-POX, OR VARIOLA.--It is to Dr. Jenner, of Berkeley,\r\n    Gloucestershire, who died in 1823, that we owe the practice of\r\n    vaccination, as a preservative from the attack of that\r\n    destructive scourge of the human race, the small-pox. The\r\n    experiments of this philosophic man were begun in 1797, and\r\n    published the next year. He had observed that cows were subject\r\n    to a certain infectious eruption of the teats, and that those\r\n    persons who became affected by it, while milking the cattle,\r\n    escaped the small-pox raging around them. This fact, known to\r\n    farmers from time immemorial, led him to a course of\r\n    experiments, the result of which all are acquainted with.\r\n\r\nTENDRONS DE VEAU (an Entree).\r\n\r\n910. INGREDIENTS.--The gristles from 2 breasts of veal, stock No. 107, 1\r\nfaggot of savoury herbs, 1 blade of pounded mace, 4 cloves, 2 carrots, 2\r\nonions, a strip of lemon-peel, egg and bread crumbs, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\nchopped mushrooms, salt and pepper to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of sherry,\r\nthe yolk of 1 egg, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--After removing the gristles from a breast of veal, stew them\r\nfor 4 hours, as in the preceding recipe, with stock, herbs, mace,\r\ncloves, carrots, onions, and lemon-peel. When perfectly tender, lift\r\nthem out and remove any bones or hard parts remaining. Put them between\r\ntwo dishes, with a weight on the top, and when cold, cut them into\r\nslices. Brush these over with egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs, and fry a\r\npale brown. Take 1/2 pint of the gravy they were boiled in, add 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of chopped mushrooms, a seasoning of salt and pepper, the\r\nsherry, and the yolk of an egg beaten with 3 tablespoonfuls of cream.\r\nStir the sauce over the fire until it thickens; when it is on the _point\r\nof boiling_, dish the tendrons in a circle, and pour the sauce in the\r\nmiddle. Tendrons are dressed in a variety of ways,--with sauce à\r\nl'Espagnole, vegetables of all kinds: when they are served with a purée,\r\nthey should always be glazed.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4-1/2 hours. _Average cost_.--Usually bought with breast of\r\nveal.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for an entrée.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nTETE DE VEAU EN TORTUE (an Entree).\r\n\r\n911. INGREDIENTS.--Half a calf's head, or the remains of a cold boiled\r\none; rather more than 1 pint of good white stock, No. 107, 1 glass of\r\nsherry or Madeira, cayenne and salt to taste, about 12 mushroom-buttons\r\n(when obtainable), 6 hard-boiled eggs, 4 gherkins, 8 quenelles or\r\nforcemeat balls, No. 422 or 423, 12 crayfish, 12 croûtons.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Half a calf's head is sufficient to make a good entrée, and if\r\nthere are any remains of a cold one left from the preceding day, it will\r\nanswer very well for this dish. After boiling the head until tender,\r\nremove the bones, and cut the meat into neat pieces; put the stock into\r\na stewpan, add the wine, and a seasoning of salt and cayenne; fry the\r\nmushrooms in butter for 2 or 3 minutes, and add these to the gravy. Boil\r\nthis quickly until somewhat reduced; then put in the yolks of the\r\nhard-boiled eggs _whole_, the whites cut in small pieces, and the\r\ngherkins chopped. Have ready a few veal quenelles, made by recipe No.\r\n422 or 423; add these, with the slices of head, to the other\r\ningredients, and let the whole get thoroughly hot, _without boiling_.\r\nArrange the pieces of head as high in the centre of the dish as\r\npossible; pour over them the ragout, and garnish with the crayfish and\r\ncroûtons placed alternately. A little of the gravy should also be served\r\nin a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/2 hour to reduce the stock.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the calf's head, 2s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n    A FRENCHMAN'S OPINION OF VEAL.--A great authority in his native\r\n    Paris tells us, that veal, as a meat, is but little nourishing,\r\n    is relaxing, and sufficiently difficult of digestion. Lending\r\n    itself, as it does, he says, in all the flowery imagery of the\r\n    French tongue and manner, \"to so many metamorphoses, it may be\r\n    called, without exaggeration, the chameleon of the kitchen. Who\r\n    has not eaten calf's head _au naturel_, simply boiled with the\r\n    skin on, its flavour heightened by sauce just a little sharp? It\r\n    is a dish as wholesome as it is agreeable, and one that the most\r\n    inexperienced cook may serve with success. Calf's feet _à la\r\n    poulette_, _au gratin_, fried, &c.; _les cervelles_, served in\r\n    the same manner, and under the same names; sweetbreads _en\r\n    fricandeau_, _piqués en fin_,--all these offer most satisfactory\r\n    entrées, which the art of the cook, more or less, varies for the\r\n    gratification of his glory and the well-being of our appetites.\r\n    We have not spoken, in the above catalogue, either of the liver,\r\n    or of the _fraise_, or of the ears, which also share the honour\r\n    of appearing at our tables. Where is the man not acquainted with\r\n    calf's liver _à la bourgeoise_, the most frequent and convenient\r\n    dish at unpretentious tables? The _fraise_, cooked in water, and\r\n    eaten with vinegar, is a wholesome and agreeable dish, and\r\n    contains a mucilage well adapted for delicate persons. Calf's\r\n    ears have, in common with the feet and _cervelles_, the\r\n    advantage of being able to be eaten either fried or _à la\r\n    poulette_; and besides, can be made into a _farce_, with the\r\n    addition of peas, onions, cheese, &c. Neither is it confined to\r\n    the calf's tongue, or even the eyes, that these shall dispute\r\n    alone the glory of awakening the taste of man; thus, the\r\n    _fressure_ (which, as is known, comprises the heart, the _mou_,\r\n    and the _rate_), although not a very recherché dish, lends\r\n    itself to all the caprices of an expert artist, and may, under\r\n    various marvellous disguises, deceive, and please, and even\r\n    awaken our appetite.\"--Verily, we might say, after this rhapsody\r\n    of our neighbour, that his country's weal will not suffer in him\r\n    as an able and eloquent exponent and admirer.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEAL CARVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAST OF VEAL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREAST OF VEAL.]\r\n\r\n912. The carving of a breast of veal is not dissimilar to that of a\r\nfore-quarter of lamb, when the shoulder has been taken off. The breast\r\nof veal consists of two parts,--the rib-bones and the gristly brisket.\r\nThese two parts should first be separated by sharply passing the knife\r\nin the direction of the lines 1, 2; when they are entirely divided, the\r\nrib-bones should be carved in the direction of the lines 5 to 6; and the\r\nbrisket can be helped by cutting pieces in the direction 3 to 4. The\r\ncarver should ask the guests whether they have a preference for the\r\nbrisket or ribs; and if there be a sweetbread served with the dish, as\r\nit often is with roast breast of veal, each person should receive a\r\npiece.\r\n\r\nCALF'S HEAD.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALF'S HEAD.]\r\n\r\n913. This is not altogether the most easy-looking dish to cut when it is\r\nput before a carver for the first time; there is not much real\r\ndifficulty in the operation, however, when the head has been attentively\r\nexamined, and, after the manner of a phrenologist, you get to know its\r\nbumps, good and bad. In the first place, inserting the knife quite down\r\nto the bone, cut slices in the direction of the line 1 to 2; with each\r\nof these should be helped a piece of what is called the throat\r\nsweetbread, cut in the direction of from 3 to 4. The eye, and the flesh\r\nround, are favourite morsels with many, and should be given to those at\r\nthe table who are known to be the greatest connoisseurs. The jawbone\r\nbeing removed, there will then be found some nice lean; and the palate,\r\nwhich is reckoned by some a tit-bit, lies under the head. On a separate\r\ndish there is always served the tongue and brains, and each guest should\r\nbe asked to take some of these.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILLET OF VEAL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FILLET OF VEAL.]\r\n\r\n914. The carving of this joint is similar to that of a round of beef.\r\nSlices, not too thick, in the direction of the line 1 to 2 are cut; and\r\nthe only point to be careful about is, that the veal be _evenly_ carved.\r\nBetween the flap and the meat the stuffing is inserted, and a small\r\nportion of this should be served to every guest. The persons whom the\r\nhost wishes most to honour should be asked if they like the delicious\r\nbrown outside slice, as this, by many, is exceedingly relished.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNUCKLE OF VEAL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KNUCKLE OF VEAL.]\r\n\r\n915. The engraving, showing the dotted line from 1 to 2, sufficiently\r\nindicates the direction which should be given to the knife in carving\r\nthis dish. The best slices are those from the thickest part of the\r\nknuckle, that is, outside the line 1 to 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOIN OF VEAL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOIN OF VEAL.]\r\n\r\n916. As is the case with a loin of mutton, the careful jointing of a\r\nloin of veal is more than half the battle in carving it. If the butcher\r\nbe negligent in this matter, he should be admonished; for there is\r\nnothing more annoying or irritating to an inexperienced carver than to\r\nbe obliged to turn his knife in all directions to find the exact place\r\nwhere it should be inserted in order to divide the bones. When the\r\njointing is properly performed, there is little difficulty in carrying\r\nthe knife down in the direction of the line 1 to 2. To each guest should\r\nbe given a piece of the kidney and kidney fat, which lie underneath, and\r\nare considered great delicacies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON BIRDS.\r\n\r\n  \"Birds, the free tenants of land, air, and ocean,\r\n  Their forms all symmetry, their motions grace;\r\n  In plumage delicate and beautiful;\r\n  Thick without burthen, close as fishes' scales,\r\n  Or loose as full-blown poppies to the breeze.\"\r\n\r\n_The Pelican Island_.\r\n\r\n917. THE DIVISIONS OF BIRDS are founded principally on their habits of\r\nlife, and the natural resemblance which their external parts, especially\r\ntheir bills, bear to each other. According to Mr. Vigors, there are five\r\norders, each of which occupies its peculiar place on the surface of the\r\nglobe; so that the air, the forest, the land, the marsh, and the water,\r\nhas each its appropriate kind of inhabitants. These are respectively\r\ndesignated as BIRDS OF PREY, PERCHERS, WALKERS, WADERS, and SWIMMERS;\r\nand, in contemplating their variety, lightness, beauty, and wonderful\r\nadaptation to the regions they severally inhabit, and the functions they\r\nare destined to perform in the grand scheme of creation, our hearts are\r\nlifted with admiration at the exhaustless ingenuity, power, and wisdom\r\nof HIM who has, in producing them, so strikingly \"manifested His\r\nhandiwork.\" Not only these, however, but all classes of animals, have\r\ntheir peculiar ends to fulfil; and, in order that this may be\r\neffectually performed, they are constructed in such a manner as will\r\nenable them to carry out their conditions. Thus the quadrupeds, that are\r\nformed to tread the earth in common with man, are muscular and vigorous;\r\nand, whether they have passed into the servitude of man, or are\r\npermitted to range the forest or the field, they still retain, in a high\r\ndegree, the energies with which they were originally endowed. Birds, on\r\nthe contrary, are generally feeble, and, therefore, timid. Accordingly,\r\nwings have been given them to enable them to fly through the air, and\r\nthus elude the force which, by nature, they are unable to resist.\r\nNotwithstanding the natural tendency of all bodies towards the centre of\r\nthe earth, birds, when raised in the atmosphere, glide through it with\r\nthe greatest ease, rapidity, and vigour. There, they are in their\r\nnatural element, and can vary their course with the greatest\r\npromptitude--can mount or descend with the utmost facility, and can\r\nlight on any spot with the most perfect exactness, and without the\r\nslightest injury to themselves.\r\n\r\n918. THE MECHANISM WHICH ENABLES BIRDS to wing their course through the\r\nair, is both singular and instructive. Their bodies are covered with\r\nfeathers, which are much lighter than coverings of hair, with which\r\nquadrupeds are usually clothed. The feathers are so placed as to overlap\r\neach other, like the slates or the tiles on the roof of a house. They\r\nare also arranged from the fore-part backwards; by which the animals are\r\nenabled the more conveniently to cut their way through the air. Their\r\nbones are tubular or hollow, and extremely light compared with those of\r\nterrestrial animals. This greatly facilitates their rising from the\r\nearth, whilst their heads, being comparatively small, their bills shaped\r\nlike a wedge, their bodies slender, sharp below, and round above,--all\r\nthese present a union of conditions, favourable, in the last degree, to\r\ncutting their way through the aërial element to which they are\r\nconsidered as more peculiarly to belong. With all these conditions,\r\nhowever, birds could not fly without wings. These, therefore, are the\r\ninstruments by which they have the power of rapid locomotion, and are\r\nconstructed in such a manner as to be capable of great expansion when\r\nstruck in a downward direction. If we except, in this action, the slight\r\nhollow which takes place on the under-side, they become almost two\r\nplanes. In order that the downward action may be accomplished to the\r\nnecessary extent, the muscles which move the wings have been made\r\nexceedingly large; so large, indeed, that, in some instances, they have\r\nbeen estimated at not less than a sixth of the weight of the whole body.\r\nTherefore, when a bird is on the ground and intends to fly, it takes a\r\nleap, and immediately stretching its wings, strikes them out with great\r\nforce. By this act these are brought into an oblique direction, being\r\nturned partly upwards and partly horizontally forwards. That part of the\r\nforce which has the upward tendency is neutralized by the weight of the\r\nbird, whilst the horizontal force serves to carry it forward. The stroke\r\nbeing completed, it moves upon its wings, which, being contracted and\r\nhaving their edges turned upwards, obviate, in a great measure, the\r\nresistance of the air. When it is sufficiently elevated, it makes a\r\nsecond stroke downwards, and the impulse of the air again moves it\r\nforward. These successive strokes may be regarded as so many leaps taken\r\nin the air. When the bird desires to direct its course to the right or\r\nthe left, it strikes strongly with the opposite wing, which impels it to\r\nthe proper side. In the motions of the animal, too, the tail takes a\r\nprominent part, and acts like the rudder of a ship, except that, instead\r\nof sideways, it moves upwards and downwards. If the bird wishes to rise,\r\nit raises its tail; and if to fall, it depresses it; and, whilst in a\r\nhorizontal position, it keeps it steady. There are few who have not\r\nobserved a pigeon or a crow preserve, for some time, a horizontal flight\r\nwithout any apparent motion of the wings. This is accomplished by the\r\nbird having already acquired sufficient velocity, and its wings being\r\nparallel to the horizon, meeting with but small resistance from the\r\natmosphere. If it begins to fall, it can easily steer itself upward by\r\nmeans of its tail, till the motion it had acquired is nearly spent, when\r\nit must be renewed by a few more strokes of the wings. On alighting, a\r\nbird expands its wings and tail fully against the air, as a ship, in\r\ntacking round, backs her sails, in order that they may meet with all the\r\nresistance possible.\r\n\r\n919. IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE EYES of birds, there is a peculiarity\r\nnecessary to their condition. As they pass a great portion of their\r\nlives among thickets and hedges, they are provided for the defence of\r\ntheir eyes from external injuries, as well as from the effects of the\r\nlight, when flying in opposition to the rays of the sun, with a\r\nnictating or winking membrane, which can, at pleasure, be drawn over the\r\nwhole eye like a curtain. This covering is neither opaque nor wholly\r\npellucid, but is somewhat transparent; and it is by its means that the\r\neagle is said to be able to gaze at the sun. \"In birds,\" says a writer\r\non this subject, \"we find that the sight is much more piercing,\r\nextensive, and exact, than in the other orders of animals. The eye is\r\nmuch larger in proportion to the bulk of the head, than in any of these.\r\nThis is a superiority conferred upon them not without a corresponding\r\nutility: it seems even indispensable to their safety and subsistence.\r\nWere this organ in birds dull, or in the least degree opaque, they would\r\nbe in danger, from the rapidity of their motion, of striking against\r\nvarious objects in their flight. In this case their celerity, instead of\r\nbeing an advantage, would become an evil, and their flight be restrained\r\nby the danger resulting from it. Indeed we may consider the velocity\r\nwith which an animal moves, as a sure indication of the perfection of\r\nits vision. Among the quadrupeds, the sloth has its sight greatly\r\nlimited; whilst the hawk, as it hovers in the air, can espy a lark\r\nsitting on a clod, perhaps at twenty times the distance at which a man\r\nor a dog could perceive it.\"\r\n\r\n920. AMONGST THE MANY PECULIARITIES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF BIRDS, not\r\nthe least is the mode by which their respiration is accomplished. This\r\nis effected by means of air-vessels, which extend throughout the body,\r\nand adhere to the under-surface of the bones. These, by their motion,\r\nforce the air through the true lungs, which are very small, and placed\r\nin the uppermost part of the chest, and closely braced down to the back\r\nand ribs. The lungs, which are never expanded by air, are destined to\r\nthe sole purpose of oxidizing the blood. In the experiments made by Mr.\r\nJohn Hunter, to discover the use of this general diffusion of air\r\nthrough the bodies of birds, he found that it prevents their respiration\r\nfrom being stopped or interrupted by the rapidity of their motion\r\nthrough a resisting medium. It is well known that, in proportion to\r\ncelerity of motion, the air becomes resistive; and were it possible for\r\na man to move with the swiftness of a swallow, as he is not provided\r\nwith an internal construction similar to that of birds, the resistance\r\nof the air would soon suffocate him.\r\n\r\n921. BIRDS ARE DISTRIBUTED OVER EVERY PART OF THE GLOBE, being found in\r\nthe coldest as well as the hottest regions, although some species are\r\nrestricted to particular countries, whilst others are widely dispersed.\r\nAt certain seasons of the year, many of them change their abodes, and\r\nmigrate to climates better adapted to their temperaments or modes of\r\nlife, for a time, than those which they leave. Many of the birds of\r\nBritain, directed by an unerring instinct, take their departure from the\r\nisland before the commencement of winter, and proceed to the more\r\ncongenial warmth of Africa, to return with the next spring. The causes\r\nassigned by naturalists for this peculiarity are, either a deficiency of\r\nfood, or the want of a secure asylum for the incubation and nourishment\r\nof their young. Their migrations are generally performed in large\r\ncompanies, and, in the day, they follow a leader, which is occasionally\r\nchanged. During the night, many of the tribes send forth a continual\r\ncry, to keep themselves together; although one would think that the\r\nnoise which must accompany their flight would be sufficient for that\r\npurpose. The flight of birds across the Mediterranean was noticed three\r\nthousand years ago, as we find it said in the book of Numbers, in the\r\nScriptures, that \"There went forth a wind from the Lord, and brought\r\nquails from the sea, and let them fall upon the camp, and a day's\r\njourney round about it, to the height of two cubits above the earth.\"\r\n\r\n922. IF THE BEAUTY OF BIRDS were not a recommendation to their being\r\nuniversally admired, their general liveliness, gaiety, and song would\r\nendear them to mankind. It appears, however, from accurate observations\r\nfounded upon experiment, that the notes peculiar to different kinds of\r\nbirds are altogether acquired, and that they are not innate, any more\r\nthan language is to man. The attempt of a nestling bird to sing has been\r\ncompared to the endeavour of a child to talk. The first attempts do not\r\nseem to possess the slightest rudiments of the future song; but, as the\r\nbird grows older and becomes stronger, it is easily perceived to be\r\naiming at acquiring the art of giving utterance to song. Whilst the\r\nscholar is thus endeavouring to form his notes, when he is once sure of\r\na passage, he usually raises his tone, but drops it again when he finds\r\nhimself unequal to the voluntary task he has undertaken. \"Many\r\nwell-authenticated facts,\" says an ingenious writer, \"seem decisively to\r\nprove that birds have no innate notes, but that, like mankind, the\r\nlanguage of those to whose care they have been committed at their birth,\r\nwill be their language in after-life.\" It would appear, however,\r\nsomewhat unaccountable why, in a wild state, they adhere so steadily to\r\nthe song of their own species only, when the notes of so many others are\r\nto be heard around them. This is said to arise from the attention paid\r\nby the nestling bird to the instructions of its own parent only,\r\ngenerally disregarding the notes of all the rest. Persons; however, who\r\nhave an accurate ear, and who have given their attention to the songs of\r\nbirds, can frequently distinguish some which have their notes mixed with\r\nthose of another species; but this is in general so trifling, that it\r\ncan hardly be considered as more than the mere varieties of provincial\r\ndialects.\r\n\r\n923. IN REFERENCE TO THE FOOD OF BIRDS, we find that it varies, as it\r\ndoes in quadrupeds, according to the species. Some are altogether\r\ncarnivorous; others, as so many of the web-footed tribes, subsist on\r\nfish; others, again, on insects and worms; and others on grain and\r\nfruit. The extraordinary powers of the gizzard of the granivorous\r\ntribes, in comminuting their food so as to prepare it for digestion,\r\nwould, were they not supported by incontrovertible facts founded on\r\nexperiment, appear to exceed all credibility. Tin tubes, full of grain,\r\nhave been forced into the stomachs of turkeys, and in twenty-four hours\r\nhave been found broken, compressed, and distorted into every shape.\r\nTwelve small lancets, very sharp both at the point and edges, have been\r\nfixed in a ball of lead, covered with a case of paper, and given to a\r\nturkey-cock, and left in its stomach for eight hours. After that time\r\nthe stomach was opened, when nothing appeared except the naked ball. The\r\ntwelve lancets were broken to pieces, whilst the stomach remained\r\nperfectly sound and entire. From these facts, it is concluded that the\r\nstones, so frequently found in the stomachs of the feathered tribes, are\r\nhighly useful in assisting the gastric juices to grind down the grain\r\nand other hard substances which constitute their food. The stones,\r\nthemselves, being also ground down and separated by the powerful action\r\nof the gizzard, are mixed with the food, and, no doubt, contribute very\r\ngreatly to the health, as well as to the nourishment of the animals.\r\n\r\n924. ALL BIRDS BEING OVIPAROUS, the eggs which they produce after the\r\nprocess of incubation, or sitting for a certain length of time, are, in\r\nthe various species, different both in figure and colour, as well as in\r\npoint of number. They contain the elements of the future young, for the\r\nperfecting of which in the incubation a bubble of air is always placed\r\nat the large end, between the shell and the inside skin. It is supposed\r\nthat from the heat communicated by the sitting bird to this confined\r\nair, its spring is increased beyond its natural tenor, and, at the same\r\ntime, its parts are put into motion by the gentle rarefaction. By this\r\nmeans, pressure and motion are communicated to the parts of the egg,\r\nwhich, in some inscrutable way, gradually promote the formation and\r\ngrowth of the young, till the time comes for its escaping from the\r\nshell. To preserve an egg perfectly fresh, and even fit for incubation,\r\nfor 5 or 6 months after it has been laid, Réaumur, the French\r\nnaturalist, has shown that it is only necessary to stop up its pores\r\nwith a slight coating of varnish or mutton-suet.\r\n\r\n925. BIRDS HOWEVER, DO NOT LAY EGGS before they have some place to put\r\nthem; accordingly, they construct nests for themselves with astonishing\r\nart. As builders, they exhibit a degree of architectural skill,\r\nniceness, and propriety, that would seem even to mock the imitative\r\ntalents of man, however greatly these are marked by his own high\r\nintelligence and ingenuity.\r\n\r\n                          \"Each circumstance\r\n  Most artfully contrived to favour warmth.\r\n  Here read the reason of the vaulted roof;\r\n  How Providence compensates, ever kind,\r\n  The enormous disproportion that subsists\r\n  Between the mother and the numerous brood\r\n  Which her small bulk must quicken into life.\"\r\n\r\nIn building their nests, the male and female generally assist each\r\nother, and they contrive to make the outside of their tenement bear as\r\ngreat a resemblance as possible to the surrounding foliage or branches;\r\nso that it cannot very easily be discovered even by those who are in\r\nsearch of it. This art of nidification is one of the most wonderful\r\ncontrivances which the wide field of Nature can show, and which, of\r\nitself, ought to be sufficient to compel mankind to the belief, that\r\nthey and every other part of the creation, are constantly under the\r\nprotecting power of a superintending Being, whose benign dispensations\r\nseem as exhaustless as they are unlimited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICKEN CUTLETS (an Entree).\r\n\r\n926. INGREDIENTS.--2 chickens; seasoning to taste of salt, white pepper,\r\nand cayenne; 2 blades of pounded mace, egg and bread crumbs, clarified\r\nbutter, 1 strip of lemon-rind, 2 carrots, 1 onion, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\nmushroom ketchup, thickening of butter and flour, 1 egg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Remove the breast and leg bones of the chickens; cut the meat\r\ninto neat pieces after having skinned it, and season the cutlets with\r\npepper, salt, pounded mace, and cayenne. Put the bones, trimmings, &c.,\r\ninto a stewpan with 1 pint of water, adding carrots, onions, and\r\nlemon-peel in the above proportion; stew gently for 1-1/2 hour, and\r\nstrain the gravy. Thicken it with butter and flour, add the ketchup and\r\n1 egg well beaten; stir it over the fire, and bring it to the\r\nsimmering-point, but do not allow it to boil. In the mean time, egg and\r\nbread-crumb the cutlets, and give them a few drops of clarified butter;\r\nfry them a delicate brown, occasionally turning them; arrange them\r\npyramidically on the dish, and pour over them the sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to fry the cutlets. _Average cost_, 2s. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for an entrée.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to July.\r\n\r\n    FOWLS AS FOOD.--Brillat Savarin, pre-eminent in gastronomic\r\n    taste, says that he believes the whole gallinaceous family was\r\n    made to enrich our larders and furnish our tables; for, from the\r\n    quail to the turkey, he avers their flesh is a light aliment,\r\n    full of flavour, and fitted equally well for the invalid as for\r\n    the man of robust health. The fine flavour, however, which\r\n    Nature has given to all birds coming under the definition of\r\n    poultry, man has not been satisfied with, and has used many\r\n    means--such as keeping them in solitude and darkness, and\r\n    forcing them to eat--to give them an unnatural state of fatness\r\n    or fat. This fat, thus artificially produced, is doubtless\r\n    delicious, and the taste and succulence of the boiled and\r\n    roasted bird draw forth the praise of the guests around the\r\n    table. Well-fattened and tender, a fowl is to the cook what the\r\n    canvas is to the painter; for do we not see it served boiled,\r\n    roasted, fried, fricasseed, hashed, hot, cold, whole,\r\n    dismembered, boned, broiled, stuffed, on dishes, and in\r\n    pies,--always handy and ever acceptable?\r\n\r\n    THE COMMON OR DOMESTIC FOWL.--From time immemorial, the common\r\n    or domestic fowl has been domesticated in England, and is\r\n    supposed to be originally the offspring of some wild species\r\n    which abound in the forests of India. It is divided into a\r\n    variety of breeds, but the most esteemed are, the Poland or\r\n    Black, the Dorking, the Bantam, the Game Fowl, and the Malay or\r\n    Chittagong. The common, or barn-door fowl, is one of the most\r\n    delicate of the varieties; and at Dorking, in Surrey, the breed\r\n    is brought to great perfection. Till they are four months old,\r\n    the term chicken is applied to the young female; after that age\r\n    they are called pullets, till they begin to lay, when they are\r\n    called hens. The English counties most productive in poultry are\r\n    Surrey, Sussex, Norfolk, Herts, Devon, and Somerset.\r\n\r\nFRENCH CHICKEN CUTLETS (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n927. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled fowl, fried\r\nbread, clarified butter, the yolk of 1 egg, bread crumbs, 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of finely-minced lemon-peel; salt, cayenne, and mace to\r\ntaste. For sauce,--1 oz. of butter, 2 minced shalots, a few slices of\r\ncarrot, a small bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, 1 blade of\r\npounded mace, 6 peppercorns, 1/4 pint of gravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the fowls into as many nice cutlets as possible; take a\r\ncorresponding number of sippets about the same size, all cut one shape;\r\nfry them a pale brown, put them before the fire, then dip the cutlets\r\ninto clarified butter mixed with the yolk of an egg, cover with bread\r\ncrumbs seasoned in the above proportion, with lemon-peel, mace, salt,\r\nand cayenne; fry them for about 5 minutes, put each piece on one of the\r\nsippets, pile them high in the dish, and serve with the following sauce,\r\nwhich should be made ready for the cutlets. Put the butter into a\r\nstewpan, add the shalots, carrot, herbs, mace, and peppercorns; fry for\r\n10 minutes or rather longer; pour in 1/2 pint of good gravy, made of the\r\nchicken bones, stew gently for 20 minutes, strain it, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes to fry the cutlets; 35 minutes to make the gravy.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the chicken, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to July.\r\n\r\n    EGGS FOR HATCHING.--Eggs intended for hatching should be removed\r\n    as soon as laid, and placed in bran in a dry, cool place. Choose\r\n    those that are near of a size; and, as a rule, avoid those that\r\n    are equally thick at both ends,--such, probably, contain a\r\n    double yolk, and will come to no good. Eggs intended for\r\n    hatching should never be stored longer than a month, as much\r\n    less the better. Nine eggs may be placed under a Bantam hen, and\r\n    as many as fifteen under a Dorking. The odd number is considered\r\n    preferable, as more easily packed. It will be as well to mark\r\n    the eggs you give the hen to sit on, so that you may know if she\r\n    lays any more: if she does, you must remove them; for, if\r\n    hatched at all, they would be too late for the brood. If during\r\n    incubation an egg should be broken, remove it, and take out the\r\n    remainder, and cleanse them in luke-warm water, or it is\r\n    probable the sticky nature of the contents of the broken egg\r\n    will make the others cling to the hen's feathers; and they, too,\r\n    may be fractured.\r\n\r\n    HENS SITTING.--Some hens are very capricious as regards sitting;\r\n    they will make a great fuss, and keep pining for the nest, and,\r\n    when they are permitted to take to it, they will sit just long\r\n    enough to addle the eggs, and then they're off again. The safest\r\n    way to guard against such annoyance, is to supply the hen with\r\n    some hard-boiled eggs; if she sits on them a reasonable time,\r\n    and seems steadily inclined, like a good matron, you may then\r\n    give her proper eggs, and let her set about the business in\r\n    earnest.\r\n\r\nCHICKEN OR FOWL PATTIES.\r\n\r\n928. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast chicken or fowl; to every\r\n1/4 lb. of meat allow 2 oz. of ham, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of veal gravy, 1/2 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel;\r\ncayenne, salt, and pepper to taste; 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1\r\noz. of butter rolled in flour; puff paste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mince very small the white meat from a cold roast fowl, after\r\nremoving all the skin; weigh it, and to every 1/4 lb. of meat allow the\r\nabove proportion of minced ham. Put these into a stewpan with the\r\nremaining ingredients, stir over the fire for 10 minutes or 1/4 hour,\r\ntaking care that the mixture does not burn. Roll out some puff paste\r\nabout 1/4 inch in thickness; line the patty-pans with this, put upon\r\neach a small piece of bread, and cover with another layer of paste;\r\nbrush over with the yolk of an egg, and bake in a brisk oven for about\r\n1/4 hour. When done, cut a round piece out of the top, and, with a small\r\nspoon, take out the bread (be particular in not breaking the outside\r\nborder of the crust), and fill the patties with the mixture.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to prepare the meat; not quite 1/4 hour to bake the\r\ncrust.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    HATCHING.--Sometimes the chick within the shell is unable to\r\n    break away from its prison; for the white of the egg will\r\n    occasionally harden in the air to the consistence of joiners'\r\n    clue, when the poor chick is in a terrible fix. An able writer\r\n    says, \"Assistance in hatching must not be rendered prematurely,\r\n    and thence unnecessarily, but only in the case of the chick\r\n    being plainly unable to release itself; then, indeed, an\r\n    addition may probably be made to the brood, as great numbers are\r\n    always lost in this way. The chick makes a circular fracture at\r\n    the big end of the egg, and a section of about one-third of the\r\n    length of the shell being separated, delivers the prisoner,\r\n    provided there is no obstruction from adhesion of the body to\r\n    the membrane which lines the shell. Between the body of the\r\n    chick and the membrane of the shell there exists a viscous\r\n    fluid, the white of the egg thickened with the intense heat of\r\n    incubation, until it becomes a positive glue. When this happens,\r\n    the feathers stick fast to the shell, and the chicks remain\r\n    confined, and must perish, if not released.\"\r\n\r\n    The method of assistance to be rendered to chicks which have a\r\n    difficulty in releasing themselves from the shell, is to take\r\n    the egg in the hand, and dipping the finger or a piece of linen\r\n    rag in warm water, to apply it to the fastened parts until they\r\n    are loosened by the gluey substance becoming dissolved and\r\n    separated from the feathers. The chick, then, being returned to\r\n    the nest, will extricate itself,--a mode generally to be\r\n    observed, since, if violence were used, it would prove fatal.\r\n    Nevertheless, breaking the shell may sometimes be necessary; and\r\n    separating with the fingers, as gently as may be, the membrane\r\n    from the feathers, which are still to be moistened as mentioned\r\n    above, to facilitate the operation. The points of small scissors\r\n    may be useful, and when there is much resistance, as also\r\n    apparent pain to the bird, the process must be conducted in the\r\n    gentlest manner, and the shell separated into a number of small\r\n    pieces. The signs of a need of assistance are the egg being\r\n    partly pecked and chipped, and the cluck discontinuing its\r\n    efforts for five of six hours. Weakness from cold may disable\r\n    the chicken from commencing the operation of pecking the shell,\r\n    which must then be artificially performed with a circular\r\n    fracture, such as is made by the bird itself.\r\n\r\nCHICKEN OR FOWL PIE.\r\n\r\n929. INGREDIENTS.--2 small fowls or 1 large one, white pepper and salt\r\nto taste, 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoonful of pounded\r\nmace, forcemeat No. 417, a few slices of ham, 3 hard-boiled eggs, 1/2\r\npint of water, puff crust.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Skin and cut up the fowls into joints, and put the neck, leg,\r\nand backbones in a stewpan, with a little water, an onion, a bunch of\r\nsavoury herbs, and a blade of mace; let these stew for about an hour,\r\nand, when done, strain off the liquor: this is for gravy. Put a layer of\r\nfowl at the bottom of a pie-dish, then a layer of ham, then one of\r\nforcemeat and hard-boiled eggs cut in rings; between the layers put a\r\nseasoning of pounded mace, nutmeg, pepper, and salt. Proceed in this\r\nmanner until the dish is full, and pour in about 1/2 pint of water;\r\nborder the edge of the dish with puff crust, put on the cover, ornament\r\nthe top, and glaze it by brushing over it the yolk of an egg. Bake from\r\n1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour, should the pie be very large, and, when done, pour\r\nin, at the top, the gravy made from the bones. If to be eaten cold, and\r\nwished particularly nice, the joints of the fowls should be boned, and\r\nplaced in the dish with alternate layers of forcemeat; sausage-meat may\r\nalso be substituted for the forcemeat, and is now very much used. When\r\nthe chickens are boned, and mixed with sausage-meat, the pie will take\r\nabout 2 hours to bake. It should be covered with a piece of paper when\r\nabout half-done, to prevent the paste from being dried up or scorched.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--For a pie with unboned meat, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour; with boned\r\nmeat and sausage or forcemeat, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with 2 fowls, 6s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    THE YOUNG CHICKS.--The chicks that are hatched first should be\r\n    taken from underneath the hen, lest she might think her task at\r\n    an end, and leave the remaining eggs to spoil. As soon as the\r\n    young birds are taken from the mother, they must be placed in a\r\n    basket lined with soft wool, flannel, or hay, and stood in the\r\n    sunlight if it be summer time, or by the fire if the weather be\r\n    cold. It is a common practice to cram young chicks with food as\r\n    soon as they are born. This is quite unnecessary. They will, so\r\n    long as they are kept warm, come to no harm if they take no food\r\n    for twenty-four hours following their birth. Should the whole of\r\n    the brood not be hatched by that time, those that are born may\r\n    be fed with bread soaked in milk, and the yolk of a hard-boiled\r\n    egg.\r\n\r\nPOTTED CHICKEN OR FOWL (a Luncheon or Breakfast Dish).\r\n\r\n930. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast chicken; to every lb. of\r\nmeat allow 1/4 lb. of fresh butter, salt and cayenne to taste, 1\r\nteaspoonful of pounded mace, 1/4 small nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Strip the meat from the bones of cold roast fowl; when it is\r\nfreed from gristle and skin, weigh it, and, to every lb. of meat, allow\r\nthe above proportion of butter, seasoning, and spices. Cut the meat\r\ninto small pieces, pound it well with the fresh butter, sprinkle in the\r\nspices gradually, and keep pounding until reduced to a perfectly smooth\r\npaste. Put it into potting-pots for use, and cover it with clarified\r\nbutter, about 1/4 inch in thickness, and, if to be kept for some time,\r\ntie over a bladder: 2 or 3 slices of ham, minced and pounded with the\r\nabove ingredients, will be found an improvement. It should be kept in a\r\ndry place.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    FEEDING AND COOPING THE CHICKS.--When all the chicks are\r\n    hatched, they should be placed along with the mother under a\r\n    coop in a warm dry spot. If two hens happen to have their broods\r\n    at the same time, their respective chicks should be carefully\r\n    kept separate; as, if they get mixed, and so go under the wrong\r\n    coop, the hens will probably maim and destroy those who have\r\n    mistaken their dwelling. After being kept snug beneath the coop\r\n    for a week (the coop should be placed under cover at nightfall),\r\n    the chicks may be turned loose for an hour or so in the warmest\r\n    part of the day. They should be gradually weaned from the soaked\r\n    bread and chopped egg, instead of which grits or boiled barley\r\n    should be given; in 8 or 10 days their stomachs will be strong\r\n    enough to receive bruised barley, and at the end of 3 weeks, if\r\n    your chicks be healthy, they will be able to take care of\r\n    themselves. It will be well, however, to keep your eye on them a\r\n    week or so longer, as the elder chickens may drive them from\r\n    their food. Great care should be taken that the very young\r\n    chicks do not run about the wet ground or on damp grass, as this\r\n    is the most prominent and fatal cause of disease. While under\r\n    the coop with their mother, a shallow pan or plate of water\r\n    should be supplied to the chicks, as in a deeper vessel they are\r\n    liable to drench themselves and take cold, or possibly to get\r\n    drowned.\r\n\r\nCHICKEN OR FOWL SALAD.\r\n\r\n931. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled chicken, 2\r\nlettuces, a little endive, 1 cucumber, a few slices of boiled beetroot,\r\nsalad-dressing No. 506.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Trim neatly the remains of the chicken; wash, dry, and slice\r\nthe lettuces, and place in the middle of a dish; put the pieces of fowl\r\non the top, and pour the salad-dressing over them. Garnish the edge of\r\nthe salad with hard-boiled eggs cut in rings, sliced cucumber, and\r\nboiled beetroot cut in slices. Instead of cutting the eggs in rings, the\r\nyolks may be rubbed through a hair sieve, and the whites chopped very\r\nfinely, and arranged on the salad in small bunches, yellow and white\r\nalternately. This should not be made long before it is wanted for table.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold chicken, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    AGE AND FLAVOUR OF CHICKENS.--It has been the opinion of the\r\n    medical faculty of all ages and all countries, that the flesh of\r\n    the young chicken is the must delicate and easy to digest of all\r\n    animal food. It is less alkalescent than the flesh of any other\r\n    animal, and its entire freedom from any irritating quality\r\n    renders it a fit dish for the ailing, or those whose stomachs\r\n    are naturally weak. In no animal, however, does age work such a\r\n    change, in regard to the quality of its flesh, as it does in\r\n    domestic fowls. In their infancy, cocks and hens are equally\r\n    tender and toothsome; but as time overtakes them it is the cock\r\n    whose flesh toughens first. A year-old cock, indeed, is fit for\r\n    little else than to be converted into soup, while a hen at the\r\n    same age, although sufficiently substantial, is not callous to\r\n    the insinuations of a carving-knife. As regards capons, however,\r\n    the rule respecting age does not hold good. There is scarcely to\r\n    be found a more delicious animal than a well-fed, well-dressed\r\n    capon. Age does not dry up his juices; indeed, like wine, he\r\n    seems but to mellow. At three years old, even, he is as tender\r\n    as a chick, with the additional advantage of his proper chicken\r\n    flavour being fully developed. The above remarks, however,\r\n    concerning the capon, only apply to such as are _naturally_ fed,\r\n    and not crammed. The latter process may produce a\r\n    handsome-looking bird, and it may weigh enough to satisfy the\r\n    whim or avarice of its stuffer; but, when before the fire, it\r\n    will reveal the cruel treatment to which it has been subjected,\r\n    and will weep a drippingpan-ful of fat tears. You will never\r\n    find heart enough to place such a grief-worn guest at the head\r\n    of your table. It should be borne in mind as a rule, that\r\n    small-boned and short-legged poultry are likely to excel the\r\n    contrary sort in delicacy of colour, flavour, and fineness of\r\n    flesh.\r\n\r\nHASHED DUCK (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n932. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast duck, rather more than 1\r\npint of weak stock or water, 1 onion, 1 oz. of butter, thickening of\r\nbutter and flour, salt and cayenne to taste, 1/2 teaspoonful of minced\r\nlemon-peel, 1 dessertspoonful of lemon-juice, 1/2 glass of port wine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the duck into nice joints, and put the trimmings into a\r\nstewpan; slice and fry the onion in a little butter; add these to the\r\ntrimmings, pour in the above proportion of weak stock or water, and stew\r\ngently for 1 hour. Strain the liquor, thicken it with butter and flour,\r\nseason with salt and cayenne, and add the remaining ingredients; boil it\r\nup and skim well; lay in the pieces of duck, and let them get thoroughly\r\nhot through by the side of the fire, but do not allow them to boil: they\r\nshould soak in the gravy for about 1/2 hour. Garnish with sippets of\r\ntoasted bread. The hash may be made richer by using a stronger and more\r\nhighly-flavoured gravy; a little spice or pounded mace may also be\r\nadded, when their flavour is liked.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the cold duck, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to February; ducklings from May to August.\r\n\r\n    THE DUCK.--This bird belongs to the order of _Natatores_, or\r\n    Swimmers; the most familiar tribes of which are ducks, swans,\r\n    geese, auks, penguins, petrels, pelicans, guillemots, gulls, and\r\n    terns. They mostly live in the water, feeding on fish, worms,\r\n    and aquatic plants. They are generally polygamous, and make\r\n    their nests among reeds, or in moist places. The flesh of many\r\n    of the species is eatable, but that of some is extremely rank\r\n    and oily. The duck is a native of Britain, but is found on the\r\n    margins of most of the European lakes. It is excessively greedy,\r\n    and by no means a nice feeder. It requires a mixture of\r\n    vegetable and animal food; but aquatic insects, corn, and\r\n    vegetables, are its proper food. Its flesh, however, is savoury,\r\n    being not so gross as that of the goose, and of easier\r\n    digestion. In the green-pea season it is usually found on an\r\n    English table; but, according to Ude, \"November is its proper\r\n    season, when it is plump and fat.\"\r\n\r\nTO RAGOUT A DUCK WHOLE.\r\n\r\n933. INGREDIENTS.--1 large duck, pepper and salt to taste, good beef\r\ngravy, 2 onions sliced, 4 sage-leaves, a few leaves of lemon thyme,\r\nthickening of butter and flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--After having emptied and singed the duck, season it inside with\r\npepper and salt, and truss it. Roast it before a clear fire for about 20\r\nminutes, and let it acquire a nice brown colour. Put it into a stewpan\r\nwith sufficient well-seasoned beef gravy to cover it; slice and fry the\r\nonions, and add these, with the sage-leaves and lemon thyme, both of\r\nwhich should be finely minced, to the stock. Simmer gently until the\r\nduck is tender; strain, skim, and thicken the gravy with a little butter\r\nand flour; boil it up, pour over the duck, and serve. When in season,\r\nabout, 1-1/2 pint of young green peas, boiled separately, and put in the\r\nragoût, very much improve this dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to roast the duck; 20 minutes to stew it.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to February; ducklings from April to August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUENOS AYRES DUCKS.]\r\n\r\n    THE BUENOS AYRES DUCK.--The Buenos Ayres duck is of East-Indian\r\n    birth, and is chiefly valuable as an ornament; for we suppose\r\n    one would as soon think of picking a Chinese teal for luncheon,\r\n    or a gold fish for breakfast, as to consign the handsome Buenos\r\n    Ayres to the spit. The prevailing colour of this bird is black,\r\n    with a metallic lustre, and a gleaming of blue steel about its\r\n    breast and wings.\r\n\r\n    VARIETIES OF DUCKS.--Naturalists count nearly a hundred\r\n    different species of ducks; and there is no doubt that the\r\n    intending keeper of these harmless and profitable birds may\r\n    easily take his choice from amongst twenty different sorts.\r\n    There is, however, so little difference in the various members\r\n    of the family, either as regards hardiness, laying, or hatching,\r\n    that the most incompetent fancier or breeder may indulge his\r\n    taste without danger of making a bad bargain. In connection with\r\n    their value for table, light-coloured ducks are always of milder\r\n    flavour than those that are dark-coloured, the white Aylesbury's\r\n    being general favourites. Ducks reared exclusively on vegetable\r\n    diet will have a whiter and more delicate flesh than those\r\n    allowed to feed on animal offal; while the flesh of birds\r\n    fattened on the latter food, will be firmer than that of those\r\n    which have only partaken of food of a vegetable nature.\r\n\r\nROAST DUCKS.\r\n\r\n934. INGREDIENTS.--A couple of ducks; sage-and-onion stuffing No. 504; a\r\nlittle flour.\r\n\r\n_Choosing and Trussing_.--Choose ducks with plump bellies, and with\r\nthick and yellowish feet. They should be trussed with the feet on, which\r\nshould be scalded, and the skin peeled off, and then turned up close to\r\nthe legs. Run a skewer through the middle of each leg, after having\r\ndrawn them as close as possible to the body, to plump up the breast,\r\npassing the same quite through the body. Cut off the heads and necks,\r\nand the pinions at the first joint; bring these close to the sides,\r\ntwist the feet round, and truss them at the back of the bird. After the\r\nduck is stuffed, both ends should be secured with string, so as to keep\r\nin the seasoning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST DUCK.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--To insure ducks being tender, never dress them the same day\r\nthey are killed; and if the weather permits, they should hang a day or\r\ntwo. Make a stuffing of sage and onion sufficient for one duck, and\r\nleave the other unseasoned, as the flavour is not liked by everybody.\r\nPut them down to a brisk clear fire, and keep them well basted the whole\r\nof the time they are cooking. A few minutes before serving, dredge them\r\nlightly with flour, to make them froth and look plump; and when the\r\nsteam draws towards the fire, send them to table hot and quickly, with a\r\ngood brown gravy poured _round_, but not _over_ the ducks, and a little\r\nof the same in a tureen. When in season, green peas should invariably\r\naccompany this dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Full-grown ducks from 3/4 to 1 hour; ducklings from 25 to 35\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--A. couple of ducks for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Ducklings from April to August; ducks from November to\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Ducklings are trussed and roasted in the same manner, and\r\nserved with the same sauces and accompaniments. When in season, serve\r\napple sauce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUEN DUCKS.]\r\n\r\n    THE ROUEN DUCK.--The Rouen, or Rhone duck, is a large and\r\n    handsome variety, of French extraction. The plumage of the Rouen\r\n    duck is somewhat sombre; its flesh is also much darker, and,\r\n    though of higher flavour, not near so delicate as that of our\r\n    own Aylesbury. It is with this latter breed that the Rouen duck\r\n    is generally mated; and the result is said to be increase of\r\n    size and strength. In Normandy and Brittany these ducks, as well\r\n    as other sorts, greatly abound; and the \"duck-liver _pâtés_\" are\r\n    there almost as popular as the _pâté de foie gras_ of Strasburg.\r\n    In order to bring the livers of the wretched duck to the\r\n    fashionable and unnatural size, the same diabolical cruelty is\r\n    resorted to as in the case of the Strasburg goose. The poor\r\n    birds are _nailed_ by the feet to a board placed close to a\r\n    fire, and, in that position, plentifully supplied with food and\r\n    water. In a few days, the carcase is reduced to a mere shadow,\r\n    while the liver has grown monstrously. We would rather abstain\r\n    from the acquaintance of a man who ate _pâté de foie gras_,\r\n    knowing its component parts.\r\n\r\n    DUCK'S EGGS.--The ancient notion that ducks whose beaks have a\r\n    tendency to curve upwards, are better layers than those whose\r\n    beaks do not thus point, is, we need hardly say, simply absurd:\r\n    all ducks are good layers, if they are carefully fed and tended.\r\n    Ducks generally lay at night, or early in the morning. While\r\n    they are in perfect health, they will do this; and one of the\r\n    surest signs of indisposition, among birds of this class, is\r\n    irregularity in laying. The eggs laid will approach nearly the\r\n    colour of the layer,--light-coloured ducks laying white eggs,\r\n    and brown ducks greenish-blue eggs; dark-coloured birds laying\r\n    the largest eggs. One time of day the notion was prevalent that\r\n    a duck would hatch no other eggs than her own; and although this\r\n    is not true, it will be, nevertheless, as well to match the\r\n    duck's own eggs as closely as possible; for we have known\r\n    instances wherein the duck has turned out of the nest and\r\n    destroyed eggs differing from her own in size and colour.\r\n\r\n    DUCKS.--The Mallard, or Wild Duck, from which is derived the\r\n    domestic species, is prevalent throughout Europe, Asia, and\r\n    America. The mallard's most remarkable characteristic is one\r\n    which sets at defiance the speculations of the most profound\r\n    ornithologist. The female bird is extremely plain, but the\r\n    male's plumage is a splendour of greens and browns, and browns\r\n    and blues. In the spring, however, the plumage of the male\r\n    begins to fade, and in two months, every vestige of his finery\r\n    has departed, and he is not to be distinguished from his\r\n    soberly-garbed wife. Then the greens, and the blues, and the\r\n    browns begin to bud out again, and by October he is once more a\r\n    gorgeous drake. It is to be regretted that domestication has\r\n    seriously deteriorated the moral character of the duck. In a\r\n    wild state, he is a faithful husband, desiring but one wife, and\r\n    devoting himself to her; but no sooner is he domesticated than\r\n    he becomes polygamous, and makes nothing of owning ten or a\r\n    dozen wives at a time. As regards the females, they are much\r\n    more solicitous for the welfare of their progeny in a wild state\r\n    than a tame. Should a tame duck's duckling get into mortal\r\n    trouble, its mother will just signify her sorrow by an extra\r\n    \"quack,\" or so, and a flapping of her wings; but touch a wild\r\n    duck's little one if you dare! she will buffet you with her\r\n    broad wings, and dash boldly at your face with her stout beak.\r\n    If you search for her nest amongst the long grass, she will try\r\n    no end of manoeuvres to lure you from it, her favourite _ruse_\r\n    being to pretend lameness, to delude you into the notion that\r\n    you have only to pursue _her_ vigorously, and her capture is\r\n    certain; so you persevere for half a mile or so, and then she is\r\n    up and away, leaving you to find your way back to the nest if\r\n    you can. Among the ancients, opinion was at variance respecting\r\n    the wholesomeness and digestibility of goose flesh, but\r\n    concerning the excellence of the duck all parties were agreed;\r\n    indeed, they not only assigned to duck-meat the palm for\r\n    exquisite flavour and delicacy, they even attributed to it\r\n    medicinal powers of the highest order. Not only the Roman\r\n    medical writers of the time make mention of it, but likewise the\r\n    philosophers of the period. Plutarch assures us that Cato\r\n    preserved his whole household in health, in a season when plague\r\n    and disease were rife, through dieting them on roast duck.\r\n\r\nSTEWED DUCK AND PEAS (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n935. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast duck, 2 oz. of butter, 3 or\r\n4 slices of lean ham or bacon, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 2 pints of thin\r\ngravy, 1, or a small bunch of green onions, 3 sprigs of parsley, 3\r\ncloves, 1 pint of young green peas, cayenne and salt to taste, 1\r\nteaspoonful of pounded sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the butter into a stewpan; cut up the duck into joints, lay\r\nthem in with the slices of lean ham or bacon; make it brown, then dredge\r\nin a tablespoonful of flour, and stir this well in before adding the\r\ngravy. Put in the onion, parsley, cloves, and gravy, and when it has\r\nsimmered for 1/4 hour, add a pint of young green peas, and stew gently\r\nfor about 1/2 hour. Season with cayenne, salt, and sugar; take out the\r\nduck, place it round the dish, and the peas in the middle.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold duck, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to August.\r\n\r\n    DUCKS HATCHING.--Concerning incubation by ducks, a practised\r\n    writer says, \"The duck requires a secret and safe place, rather\r\n    than any attendance, and will, at nature's call, cover her eggs\r\n    and seek her food. On hatching, there is not often a necessity\r\n    for taking away any of the brood; and, having hatched, let the\r\n    mother retain her young ones upon the nest her own time. On her\r\n    moving with her brood, let a coop be prepared upon the short\r\n    grass, if the weather be fine, and under shelter, if otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n    COOPING AND FEEDING DUCKLINGS.--Brood ducks should be cooped at\r\n    some distance from any other. A wide and flat dish of water, to\r\n    be often renewed, should stand just outside the coop, and\r\n    barley, or any other meal, be the first food of the ducklings.\r\n    It will be needful, if it be wet weather, to clip their tails,\r\n    lest these draggle, and so weaken the bird. The period of the\r\n    duck's confinement to the coop will depend on the weather, and\r\n    on the strength of the ducklings. A fortnight is usually the\r\n    extent of time necessary, and they may even be sometimes\r\n    permitted to enjoy the luxury of a swim at the end of a week.\r\n    They should not, however, be allowed to stay too long in the\r\n    water at first; for they will then become ill, their feathers\r\n    get rough, and looseness of the bowels ensue. In the latter\r\n    case, let them be closely cooped for a few days, and bean-meal\r\n    or oatmeal be mixed with their ordinary food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AYLESBURY DUCKS.]\r\n\r\n    THE AYLESBURY DUCK.--The white Aylesbury duck is, and\r\n    deservedly, a universal favourite. Its snowy plumage and\r\n    comfortable comportment make it a credit to the poultry-yard,\r\n    while its broad and deep breast, and its ample back, convey the\r\n    assurance that your satisfaction will not cease at its death. In\r\n    parts of Buckinghamshire, this member of the duck family is bred\r\n    on an extensive scale; not on plains and commons, however, as\r\n    might be naturally imagined, but in the abodes of the cottagers.\r\n    Round the walls of the living-rooms, and of the bedroom even,\r\n    are fixed rows of wooden boxes, lined with hay; and it is the\r\n    business of the wife and children to nurse and comfort the\r\n    feathered lodgers, to feed the little ducklings, and to take the\r\n    old ones out for an airing. Sometimes the \"stock\" ducks are the\r\n    cottager's own property, but it more frequently happens that\r\n    they are intrusted to his care by a wholesale breeder, who pays\r\n    him so much _per_ score for all ducklings properly raised. To be\r\n    perfect, the Aylesbury duck should be plump, pure white, with\r\n    yellow feet, and a flesh-coloured beak.\r\n\r\nSTEWED DUCK AND PEAS (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n936. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast duck, 1/2 pint of good\r\ngravy, cayenne and salt to taste, 1/2 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel,\r\n1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 2 oz, of butter rolled in flour, 1-1/2\r\npint of green peas.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the duck into joints, lay it in the gravy, and add a\r\nseasoning of cayenne, salt, and minced lemon-peel; let tins gradually\r\nwarm through, but not boil. Throw the peas into boiling water slightly\r\nsalted, and boil them rapidly until tender. Drain them, stir in the\r\npounded sugar, and the butter rolled in flour; shake them over the fire\r\nfor two or three minutes, and serve in the centre of the dish, with the\r\nduck laid round.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 minutes to boil the peas, when they are full grown.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold duck, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to August.\r\n\r\n    FATTENING DUCKS.--Many duck-keepers give their birds nothing in\r\n    the shape of food, letting them wander about and pick up a\r\n    living for themselves; and they will seem to get fat even upon\r\n    this precarious feeding. Unless, however, ducks are supplied\r\n    with, besides chance food, a liberal feed of solid corn, or\r\n    grain, morning and evening, their flesh will become flabby and\r\n    insipid. The simple way to fatten ducks is to let them have as\r\n    much, substantial food as they will eat, bruised oats and\r\n    pea-meal being the standard fattening food for them. No cramming\r\n    is required, as with the turkey and some other poultry: they\r\n    will cram themselves to the very verge of suffocation. At the\r\n    same time, plenty of exercise and clean water should be at their\r\n    service.\r\n\r\n    AMERICAN MODE OF CAPTURING DUCKS.--On the American rivers, the\r\n    modes of capture are various. Sometimes half a dozen artificial\r\n    birds are fastened to a little raft, and which is so weighted\r\n    that the sham birds squat naturally on the water. This is quite\r\n    sufficient to attract the notice of a passing flock, who descend\r\n    to cultivate the acquaintance of the isolated few when the\r\n    concealed hunter, with his fowling-piece, scatters a deadly\r\n    leaden shower amongst them. In the winter, when the water is\r\n    covered with rubble ice, the fowler of the Delaware paints his\r\n    canoe entirely white, lies flat in the bottom of it, and floats\r\n    with the broken ice; from which the aquatic inhabitants fail to\r\n    distinguish it. So floats the canoe till he within it\r\n    understands, by the quacking, and fluttering, and whirring of\r\n    wings, that he is in the midst of a flock, when he is up in a\r\n    moment with the murderous piece, and dying quacks and\r\n    lamentations rend the still air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOW-BILL DUCKS.]\r\n\r\n    Bow-BILL DUCKS, &c.--Every one knows how awkward are the\r\n    _Anatidae_, waddling along on their unelastic webbed toes, and\r\n    their short legs, which, being placed considerably backward,\r\n    make the fore part of the body preponderate. Some, however, are\r\n    formed more adapted to terrestrial habits than others, and\r\n    notably amongst these may be named _Dendronessa sponsa_, the\r\n    summer duck of America. This beautiful bird rears her young in\r\n    the holes of trees, generally overhanging the water. When strong\r\n    enough, the young scramble to the mouth of the hole, launch into\r\n    the air with their little wings and feet spread out, and drop\r\n    into their favourite element. Whenever their birthplace is at\r\n    some distance from the water, the mother carries them to it, one\r\n    by one, in her bill, holding them so as not to injure their yet\r\n    tender frame. On several occasions, however, when the hole was\r\n    30, 40, or more yards from a piece of water, Audubon observed\r\n    that the mother suffered the young to fall on the grass and\r\n    dried leaves beneath the tree, and afterwards led them directly\r\n    to the nearest edge of the next pool or creek. There are some\r\n    curious varieties of the domestic duck, which only appear\r\n    interesting from their singularity, for there does not seem to\r\n    be anything of use or value in the unusual characteristics which\r\n    distinguish them; thus, the bow-bill duck, as shown in the\r\n    engraving, called by some writers the hook-bill, is remarkable\r\n    for the peculiarly strange distortion of its beak, and the tuft\r\n    on the top of its head. The penguin duck, again, waddles in an\r\n    upright position, like the penguin, on account of the unnatural\r\n    situation of its legs. These odd peculiarities add nothing of\r\n    value to the various breeds, and may be set down as only the\r\n    result of accidental malformation, transmitted from generation\r\n    to generation.\r\n\r\nSTEWED DUCK AND TURNIPS (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n937. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast duck, 1/2 pint of good\r\ngravy, 4 shalots, a few slices of carrot, a small bunch of savoury\r\nherbs, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 lb. of turnips, weighed after being\r\npeeled, 2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the duck into joints, fry the shalots, carrots, and\r\nherbs, and put them, with the duck, into the gravy; add the pounded\r\nmace, and stew gently for 20 minutes or 1/2 hour. Cut about 1 lb. of\r\nturnips, weighed after being peeled, into 1/2-inch squares, put the\r\nbutter into a stewpan, and stew them till quite tender, which will be in\r\nabout 1/2 hour, or rather more; season with pepper and salt, and serve\r\nin the centre of the dish, with the duck, &c. laid round.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 hour to stew the turnips.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold duck, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to February.\r\n\r\n    THE WILD DUCK.--In many parts of England the wild duck is to be\r\n    found, especially in those desolate fenny parts where water\r\n    abounds. In Lincolnshire they are plentiful, and are annually\r\n    taken in the decoys, which consist of ponds situate in the\r\n    marshes, and surrounded with wood or reeds to prevent the birds\r\n    which frequent them from, being disturbed. In these the birds\r\n    sleep during the day; and as soon as evening sets in, the _decoy\r\n    rises_, and the wild fowl feed during the night. Now is the time\r\n    for the decoy ducks to entrap the others. From the ponds\r\n    diverge, in different directions, certain canals, at the end of\r\n    which funnel nets are placed; along these the _decoy ducks_,\r\n    trained for the purpose, lead the others in search of food.\r\n    After they have got a certain length, a decoy-man appears, and\r\n    drives them further on, until they are finally taken in the\r\n    nets. It is from these decoys, in Lincolnshire, that the London\r\n    market is mostly supplied. The Chinese have a singular mode of\r\n    catching these ducks. A person wades in the water up to the\r\n    chin, and, having his head covered with an empty calabash,\r\n    approaches the place where the ducks are. As the birds have no\r\n    suspicion of the nature of the object which is concealed under\r\n    the calabash, they suffer its approach, and allow it to move at\r\n    will among their flock. The man, accordingly, walks about in the\r\n    midst of his game, and, whenever he pleases, pulls them by the\r\n    legs under the water, and fixes them to his belt, until he has\r\n    secured as many as he requires, and then moves off as he went\r\n    amongst them, without exciting the slightest suspicion of the\r\n    trick he has been playing them. This singular mode of\r\n    duck-hunting is also practised on the Ganges, the earthen\r\n    vessels of the Hindoos being used instead of calabashes. These\r\n    vessels, being those in which the inhabitants boil their rice,\r\n    are considered, after once being used, as defiled, and are\r\n    accordingly thrown into the river. The duck-takers, finding them\r\n    suitable for their purpose, put them on their heads; and as the\r\n    ducks, from seeing them constantly floating down the stream, are\r\n    familiar with their appearance, they regard them as objects from\r\n    which no danger is to be expected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALL-DUCKS.]\r\n\r\n    DUCK-SNARES IN THE LINCOLNSHIRE FENS.--The following interesting\r\n    account of how duck-snaring used to be managed in the\r\n    Lincolnshire fens, was published some years ago, in a work\r\n    entitled the \"Feathered Tribes.\"--\"In the lakes to which they\r\n    resorted, their favourite haunts were observed, and in the most\r\n    sequestered part of a haunt, a pipe or ditch was cut across the\r\n    entrance, decreasing gradually in width from the entrance to the\r\n    further end, which was not more than two feet wide. The ditch\r\n    was of a circular form, but did not bend much for the first ten\r\n    yards. The banks of the lake on each side of the ditch were kept\r\n    clear of weeds and close herbage, in order that the ducks might\r\n    get on them to sit and dress themselves. Along the ditch, poles\r\n    were driven into the ground close to the edge on each side, and\r\n    the tops were bent over across the ditch and tied together. The\r\n    poles then bent forward at the entrance to the ditch, and formed\r\n    an arch, the top of which was tea feet distant from the surface\r\n    of the water; the arch was made to decrease in height as the\r\n    ditch decreased in width, so that the remote end was not more\r\n    than eighteen inches in height. The poles were placed about six\r\n    feet from each other, and connected by poles laid lengthwise\r\n    across the arch, and tied together. Over the whole was thrown a\r\n    net, which was made fast to a reed fence at the entrance and\r\n    nine or ten yards up the ditch, and afterwards strongly pegged\r\n    to the ground. At the end of the ditch furthest from the\r\n    entrance, was fixed what was called a tunnel-net, of about four\r\n    yards in length, of a round form, and kept open by a number of\r\n    hoops about eighteen inches in diameter, placed at a small\r\n    distance from each other to keep it distended. Supposing the\r\n    circular bend of the ditch to be to the right, when one stands\r\n    with his back to the lake, then on the left-hand side, a number\r\n    of reed fences were constructed, called shootings, for the\r\n    purpose of screening the decoy-man from observation, and, in\r\n    such a manner, that the fowl in the decoy would not be alarmed\r\n    while he was driving those that were in the pipe. These\r\n    shootings, which were ten in number, were about four yards in\r\n    length and about six feet high. From the end of the last\r\n    shooting a person could not see the lake, owing to the bend of\r\n    the ditch; and there was then no further occasion for shelter.\r\n    Were it not for these shootings, the fowl that remained about\r\n    the mouth of the ditch would have been alarmed, if the person\r\n    driving the fowl already under the net should have been exposed,\r\n    and would have become so shy as entirely to forsake the place.\"\r\n\r\n    THE DECOY MAN, DOG, AND DUCKS.--\"The first thing the decoy-man\r\n    did, on approaching the ditch, was to take a piece of lighted\r\n    peat or turf, and to hold it near his mouth, to prevent the\r\n    birds from smelling him. He was attended by a dog trained to\r\n    render him assistance. He walked very silently about halfway up\r\n    the shootings, where a small piece of wood was thrust through\r\n    the reed fence, which made an aperture just large enough to\r\n    enable him to see if there were any fowl within; if not, he\r\n    walked to see if any were about the entrance to the ditch. If\r\n    there were, he stopped, made a motion to his dog, and gave him a\r\n    piece of cheese to eat, when the dog went directly to a hole\r\n    through the reed fence, and the birds immediately flew off the\r\n    back into the water. The dog returned along the bank between the\r\n    reed fences, and came out to his master at another hole. The man\r\n    then gave the dog something more to encourage him, and the dog\r\n    repeated his rounds, till the birds were attracted by his\r\n    motions, and followed him into the mouth of the ditch--an\r\n    operation which was called 'working them.' The man now retreated\r\n    further back, working the dog at different holes, until the\r\n    ducks were sufficiently under the net. He then commanded his dog\r\n    to lie down under the fence, and going himself forward to the\r\n    end of the ditch next the lake, he took off his hat, and gave it\r\n    a wave between the shootings. All the birds that were under the\r\n    net could then see him, but none that were in the lake could.\r\n    The former flew forward, and the man then ran to the next\r\n    shooting, and waved his hat, and so on, driving them along until\r\n    they came into the tunnel-net, into which they crept. When they\r\n    were all in, the man gave the net a twist, so as to prevent them\r\n    getting back. He then took the net off from the end of the\r\n    ditch, and taking out, one by one, the ducks that were in it,\r\n    dislocated their necks.\"\r\n\r\nBOILED FOWLS OR CHICKENS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILED FOWL.]\r\n\r\n938. INGREDIENTS.--A pair of fowls; water.\r\n\r\n_Choosing and Trussing_.--In choosing fowls for boiling, it should be\r\nborne in mind that those that are not black-legged are generally much\r\nwhiter when dressed. Pick, draw, singe, wash, and truss them in the\r\nfollowing manner, without the livers in the wings; and, in drawing, be\r\ncareful not to break the gall-bladder:--Cut off the neck, leaving\r\nsufficient skin to skewer back. Cut the feet off to the first joint,\r\ntuck the stumps into a slit made on each side of the belly, twist the\r\nwings over the back of the fowl, and secure the top of the leg and the\r\nbottom of the wing together by running a skewer through them and the\r\nbody. The other side must be done in the same manner. Should the fowl be\r\nvery large and old, draw the sinews of the legs before tucking them in.\r\nMake a slit in the apron of the fowl, large enough to admit the parson's\r\nnose, and tie a string on the tops of the legs to keep them in their\r\nproper place.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--When, they are firmly trussed, put them into a stewpan with\r\nplenty of hot water; bring it to boil, and carefully remove all the scum\r\nas it rises. _Simmer very gently_ until the fowl is tender, and bear in\r\nmind that the slower it boils, the plumper and whiter will the fowl be.\r\nMany cooks wrap them in a floured cloth to preserve the colour, and to\r\nprevent the scum from clinging to them; in this case, a few slices of\r\nlemon should be placed on the breasts; over these a sheet of buttered\r\npaper, and then the cloth; cooking them in this manner renders the flesh\r\nvery white. Boiled ham, bacon, boiled tongue, or pickled pork, are the\r\nusual accompaniments to boiled fowls, and they may be served with\r\nBéchamel, white sauce, parsley and butter, oyster, lemon, liver, celery,\r\nor mushroom sauce. A little should be poured over the fowls, after the\r\nskewers are removed, and the remainder sent in a tureen to table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Large fowl, 1 hour; moderate-sized one, 3/4 hour; chicken, from\r\n20 minutes to 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 5s. the pair.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but scarce in early spring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GAME-FOWLS.]\r\n\r\n    THE GAME FOWL.--Respecting the period at which this well-known\r\n    member of the _Gallus_ family became domesticated, history is\r\n    silent. There is little doubt, however, that, like the dog, it\r\n    has been attached to mankind ever since mankind were attached to\r\n    civilization. Although the social position of this bird is, at\r\n    the present time, highly respectable, it is nothing to what it\r\n    was when Rome was mistress of the world. Writing at that period,\r\n    Pliny says, respecting the domestic cock, \"The gait of the cock\r\n    is proud and commanding; he walks with head erect and elevated\r\n    crest; alone, of all birds, he habitually looks up to the sky,\r\n    raising, at the same time, his curved and scythe-formed tail,\r\n    and inspiring terror in the lion himself, that most intrepid of\r\n    animals.----They regulate the conduct of our magistrates, and\r\n    open or close to them their own houses. They prescribe rest or\r\n    movement to the Roman fasces: they command or prohibit battles.\r\n    In a word, they lord it over the masters of the world.\" As well\r\n    among the ancient Greeks as the Romans, was the cock regarded\r\n    with respect, and even awe. The former people practised\r\n    divinations by means of this bird. Supposing there to be a doubt\r\n    in the camp as to the fittest day to fight a battle, the letter\r\n    of every day in the week would be placed face downwards, and a\r\n    grain of corn placed on each; then the sacred cock would be let\r\n    loose, and, according to the letters he pecked his corn from, so\r\n    would the battle-time be regulated. On one momentous occasion,\r\n    however, a person inimical to priestly interest officiously\r\n    examined the grain, and found that those lying on the letters\r\n    not wanted were made of wax, and the birds, preferring the true\r\n    grain, left these untouched. It is needless to add that, after\r\n    this, divination through the medium of cocks and grain fell out\r\n    of fashion. Whether or no the learned fowl above alluded to were\r\n    of the \"game\" breed, is unknown; but that the birds were bred\r\n    for the inhuman sport of fighting many hundred years before the\r\n    Christian era, there can be no doubt. Themistocles, the Athenian\r\n    king, who flourished more than two thousand years ago, took\r\n    advantage of the sight of a pitched battle between two cocks to\r\n    harangue his soldiers on courage. \"Observe,\" said he, \"with what\r\n    intrepid valour they fight, inspired by no other motive than\r\n    lore of victory; whereas you have to contend for your religion\r\n    and your liberty, for your wives and children, and for the tombs\r\n    of your ancestors.\" And to this day his courage has not\r\n    degenerated. He still preserves his bold and elegant gait, his\r\n    sparkling eye, while his wedge-shaped beak and cruel spurs are\r\n    ever ready to support his defiant crow. It is no wonder that the\r\n    breed is not plentiful--first, on account of the few eggs laid\r\n    by the hen; and, secondly, from the incurable pugnacity of the\r\n    chicks. Half fledged broods may be found blind as bats from\r\n    fighting, and only waiting for the least glimmer of sight to be\r\n    at it again. Without doubt, the flesh of game fowls is every way\r\n    superior to that of every chicken of the family.\r\n\r\nBROILED FOWL AND MUSHROOM SAUCE.\r\n\r\n939. INGREDIENTS.--A large fowl, seasoning, to taste, of pepper and\r\nsalt, 2 handfuls of button mushrooms, 1 slice of lean ham, 3/4 pint of\r\nthickened gravy, 1 teaspoonful of lemon-juice, 1/2 teaspoonful of\r\npounded sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the fowl into quarters, roast it until three-parts done,\r\nand keep it well basted whilst at the fire. Take the fowl up, broil it\r\nfor a few minutes over a clear fire, and season it with pepper and salt.\r\nHave ready some mushroom sauce made in the following manner. Put the\r\nmushrooms into a stewpan with a small piece of butter, the ham, a\r\nseasoning of pepper and salt, and the gravy; simmer these gently for 1/2\r\nhour, add the lemon-juice and sugar, dish the fowl, and pour the sauce\r\nround them.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To roast the fowl, 35 minutes; to broil it, 10 to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--In full season from May to January.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK BANTAMS.]\r\n\r\n    THE BANTAM.--No one will dispute that for beauty, animation,\r\n    plumage, and courage the Bantam is entitled to rank next to the\r\n    game fowl. As its name undoubtedly implies, the bird is of\r\n    Asiatic origin. The choicest sorts are the buff-coloured, and\r\n    those that are entirely black. A year-old Bantam cock of pure\r\n    breed will not weigh more than sixteen ounces. Despite its small\r\n    size, however, it is marvellously bold, especially in defence of\r\n    its progeny. A friend of the writer's, residing at Kensington,\r\n    possessed a pair of thorough-bred Bantams, that were allowed the\r\n    range of a yard where a fierce bull-terrier was kennelled. The\r\n    hen had chicks; and, when about three weeks old, one of them\r\n    strayed into the dog-kennel. The grim beast within took no\r\n    notice of the tiny fledgling; but, when the anxious mother\r\n    ventured in to fetch out the truant, with a growl the dog woke,\r\n    and nearly snapped her asunder in his great jaws. The cock bird\r\n    saw the tragic fate of its partner; but, nothing daunted, flew\r\n    at the dog with a fierce cry, and pecked savagely at its face.\r\n    The odds, however, were too great; and, when the terrier had\r\n    sufficiently recovered from the astonishment caused by the\r\n    sudden and unexpected attack, he seized the audacious Bantam,\r\n    and shook him to death; and, in five minutes, the devoted couple\r\n    were entombed in _Pincher's_ capacious maw.\r\n\r\nBOILED FOWL AND RICE.\r\n\r\n940. INGREDIENTS.--1 fowl, mutton broth, 2 onions, 2 small blades of\r\npounded mace, pepper and salt to taste, 1/4 pint of rice, parsley and\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Truss the fowl as for boiling, and put it into a stewpan with\r\nsufficient clear well-skimmed mutton broth to cover it; add the onion,\r\nmace, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; stew very gently for about 1\r\nhour, should the fowl be large, and about 1/2 hour before it is ready\r\nput in the rice, which should be well washed and soaked. When the latter\r\nis tender, strain it from the liquor, and put it on a sieve reversed to\r\ndry before the fire, and, in the mean time, keep the fowl hot. Dish it,\r\nput the rice round as a border, pour a little parsley and butter over\r\nthe fowl, and the remainder send to table in a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A large fowl, 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but scarce in early spring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DORKINGS.]\r\n\r\n    THE DORKING.--This bird takes its name from that of a town in\r\n    Surrey, where the breed is to be found in greater numbers, and\r\n    certainly in greater perfection, than elsewhere. It is generally\r\n    believed that this particular branch of poultry was found in the\r\n    town above mentioned as long ago as the Roman era. The Dorking's\r\n    chief characteristic is that he has five claws on each foot; the\r\n    extra claw, however, is never of sufficient length to encumber\r\n    the foot, or to cause it to \"drag\" its nest, or scratch out the\r\n    eggs. The colour of the true Dorking is pure white; long in the\r\n    body, short in the legs, and a prolific layer. Thirty years ago,\r\n    there was much controversy respecting the origin of the Dorking.\r\n    The men of Sussex declared that the bird belonged to them, and\r\n    brought birds indigenous to their weald, and possessing all the\r\n    Dorking fine points and peculiarities, in proof of the\r\n    declaration. Others inclined to the belief that the Poland bird\r\n    was the father of the Dorking, and not without at least a show\r\n    of reason, as the former bird much resembles the latter in\r\n    shape; and, despite its sombre hue, it is well known that the\r\n    Poland cock will occasionally beget thorough white stock from\r\n    white English hens. The commotion has, however, long ago\r\n    subsided, and Dorking still retains its fair reputation for\r\n    fowl.\r\n\r\nCURRIED FOWL.\r\n\r\n941. INGREDIENTS.--1 fowl, 2 oz. of butter, 3 onions sliced, 1 pint of\r\nwhite veal gravy, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nflour, 1 apple, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nlemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the butter into a stewpan, with the onions sliced, the fowl\r\ncut into small joints, and the apple peeled, cored, and minced. Fry of a\r\npale brown, add the stock, and stew gently for 20 minutes; rub down the\r\ncurry-powder and flour with a little of the gravy, quite smoothly, and\r\nstir this to the other ingredients; simmer for rather more than 1/2\r\nhour, and just before serving, add the above proportion of hot cream and\r\nlemon-juice. Serve with boiled rice, which may either be heaped lightly\r\non a dish by itself, or put round the curry as a border.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--50 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in the winter.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This curry may be made of cold chicken, but undressed meat will\r\nbe found far superior.\r\n\r\n    THE POLAND.--This bird, a native of Holland, is a great\r\n    favourite with fowl-keepers, especially those who have on eye to\r\n    profit rather than to amusement. Those varieties known as the\r\n    \"silver spangled\" and the \"gold spangled\" are handsome enough to\r\n    please the most fastidious; but the common black breed, with the\r\n    bushy crown of white feathers, is but a plain bird. The chief\r\n    value of the common Poland lies in the great number of eggs they\r\n    produce; indeed, in many parts, they are as well known as\r\n    \"everlasting layers\" as by their proper name. However, the\r\n    experienced breeder would take good care to send the eggs of his\r\n    everlasting layers to market, and not use them for home\r\n    consumption, as, although they may be as large as those laid by\r\n    other hens, the amount of nutriment contained in them is not\r\n    nearly so great. Mr. Mowbray once kept an account of the number\r\n    of eggs produced by this prolific bird, with the following\r\n    result:--From the 25th of October to the 25th of the following\r\n    September five hens laid 503 eggs; the average weight of each\r\n    egg was one ounce five drachms, and the total weight of the\r\n    whole, exclusive of the shells, 50-1/4 pounds. Taking the weight\r\n    of the birds at the fair average of five pounds each, we thus\r\n    see them producing within a year double their weight of egg\r\n    alone; and, supposing every egg to contain a chick, and allowing\r\n    the chick to, grow, in less than eighteen months from the laying\r\n    of the first egg, _two thousand five hundred pounds_ of\r\n    chicken-meat would be the result. The Poland is easily fattened,\r\n    and its flesh is generally considered juicier and of richer\r\n    flavour than most others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPANGLED POLANDS.]\r\n\r\nCURRIED FOWL OR CHICKEN (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n942. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowls, 2 large onions, 1\r\napple, 2 oz. of butter, 1 dessertspoonful of curry-powder, 1 teaspoonful\r\nof flour, 1/2 pint of gravy, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice the onions, peel, core, and chop the apple, and cut the\r\nfowl into neat joints; fry these in the butter of a nice brown; then add\r\nthe curry-powder, flour, and gravy, and stew for about 20 minutes. Put\r\nin the lemon-juice, and serve with boiled rice, either placed in a ridge\r\nround the dish or separately. Two or three shallots or a little garlic\r\nmay be added, if approved.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1/2 hour. _Av. cost_, exclusive of the cold fowl,\r\n6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in the winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCHIN-CHINAS.]\r\n\r\n    THE COCHIN-CHINA.--About fifteen years ago, the arrival of this\r\n    distinguished Asiatic created in England as great a sensation as\r\n    might be expected from the landing of an invading host. The\r\n    first pair that ever made their appearance here were natives of\r\n    Shanghai, and were presented to the queen, who exhibited them at\r\n    the Dublin poultry-show of 1818. Then began the \"Cochin\"\r\n    _furor_. As soon as it was discovered, despite the most\r\n    strenuous endeavours to keep the tremendous secret, that a\r\n    certain dealer was possessed of a pair of these birds,\r\n    straightway the avenues to that dealer's shop were blocked by\r\n    broughams, and chariots, and hack cabs, until the shy poulterer\r\n    had been tempted by a sufficiently high sum to part with his\r\n    treasure. Bank-notes were exchanged for Cochin chicks, and\r\n    Cochin eggs were in as great demand as though they had been laid\r\n    by the fabled golden goose. The reign of the Cochin China was,\r\n    however, of inconsiderable duration. The bird that, in 1847,\r\n    would fetch thirty guineas, is now counted but ordinary\r\n    chicken-meat, and its price is regulated according to its weight\r\n    when ready for the spit. As for the precious buff eggs, against\r\n    which, one time of day, guineas were weighed,--send for\r\n    sixpenn'orth at the cheesemonger's, and you will get at least\r\n    five; which is just as it should be. For elegance of shape or\r\n    quality of flesh, the Cochin cannot for a moment stand\r\n    comparison with our handsome dunghill; neither can the\r\n    indescribable mixture of growling and braying, peculiar to the\r\n    former, vie with the musical trumpeting of our own morning\r\n    herald: yet our poultry-breeders have been immense gainers by\r\n    the introduction of the ungainly celestial, inasmuch as _new\r\n    blood_ has been infused into the English chicken family. Of this\r\n    incalculable advantage we may be sure; while, as to the Cochin's\r\n    defects, they are certain to be lost in the process of \"cross\r\n    and cross\" breeding.\r\n\r\nBOILED FOWLS A LA BECHAMEL.\r\n\r\n943. INGREDIENTS.--A pair of fowls, 1 pint of Béchamel, No, 367, a few\r\nbunches of boiled brocoli or cauliflower.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Truss and boil the fowls by recipe No. 938; make a pint of\r\nBéchamel sauce by recipe No. 367; pour some of this over the fowls, and\r\nthe remainder send to table in a tureen. Garnish the dish with bunches\r\nof boiled cauliflowers or brocoli, and serve very hot. The sauce should\r\nbe made sufficiently thick to adhere to the fowls; that for the tureen\r\nshould be thinned by adding a spoonful or two of stock.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 1/2 to 1 hour, according to size.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 5s. a pair.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but scarce in early spring.\r\n\r\n    SPACE FOR FOWLS.--We are no advocates for converting the\r\n    domestic fowl into a cage-bird. We have known amateur\r\n    fowl-keepers--worthy souls, who would butter the very barley\r\n    they gave their pets, if they thought they would the more enjoy\r\n    it--coop up a male bird and three or four hens in an ordinary\r\n    egg-chest placed on its side, and with the front closely barred\r\n    with iron hooping! This system will not do. Every animal, from\r\n    man himself to the guinea-pig, must have what is vulgarly, but\r\n    truly, known as \"elbow-room;\" and it must be self-evident how\r\n    emphatically this rule applies to winged animals. It may be\r\n    urged, in the case of domestic fowls, that from constant disuse,\r\n    and from clipping and plucking, and other sorts of maltreatment,\r\n    their wings can hardly be regarded as instruments of flight; we\r\n    maintain, however, that you may pluck a fowl's wing-joints as\r\n    bare as a pumpkin, but you will not erase from his memory that\r\n    he is a fowl, and that his proper sphere is the open air. If he\r\n    likewise reflects that he is an ill-used fowl--a prison-bird--he\r\n    will then come to the conclusion, that there is not the least\r\n    use, under such circumstances, for his existence; and you must\r\n    admit that the decision is only logical and natural.\r\n\r\nBOILED FOWL, with Oysters.\r\n\r\n(_Excellent_.)\r\n\r\n944. INGREDIENTS.--1 young fowl, 3 dozen oysters, the yolks of 2 eggs,\r\n1/4 pint of cream.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Truss a young fowl as for boiling; fill the inside with oysters\r\nwhich have been bearded and washed in their own liquor; secure the ends\r\nof the fowl, put it into a jar, and plunge the jar into a saucepan of\r\nboiling water. Keep it boiling for 1-1/2 hour, or rather longer; then\r\ntake the gravy that has flowed from the oysters and fowl, of which there\r\nwill be a good quantity; stir in the cream and yolks of eggs, add a few\r\noysters scalded in their liquor; let the sauce get quite _hot_, but do\r\nnot allow it to _boil;_ pour some of it over the fowl, and the remainder\r\nsend to table in a tureen. A blade of pounded mace added to the sauce,\r\nwith the cream and eggs, will be found an improvement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. Average cost, 4s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to April.\r\n\r\n    THE FOWL-HOUSE.--In building a fowl-house, take care that it be,\r\n    if possible, built against a wall or fence that faces the\r\n    _south_, and thus insure its inmates against many cold winds,\r\n    driving rains, and sleets they will otherwise suffer. Let the\r\n    floor of the house slope half an inch to the foot from back to\r\n    front, so as to insure drainage; let it also be close, hard, and\r\n    perfectly smooth; so that it may be cleanly swept out. A capital\r\n    plan is to mix a few bushels of chalk and dry earth, spread it\r\n    over the floor, and pay a paviour's labourer a trifle to hammer\r\n    it level with his rammer. The fowl-house should be seven feet\r\n    high, and furnished with perches at least two feet apart. The\r\n    perches must be level, and not one above the other, or\r\n    unpleasant consequences may ensue to the undermost row. The\r\n    perches should be ledged (not fixed--just dropped into sockets,\r\n    that they may be easily taken out and cleaned) not lower than\r\n    five feet from the ground, convenient slips of wood being driven\r\n    into the wall, to render the ascent as easy as possible. The\r\n    front of the fowl-house should be latticed, taking care that the\r\n    interstices be not wide enough even to tempt a chick to crawl\r\n    through. Nesting-boxes, containing soft hay, and fitted against\r\n    the walls, so as to be easily reached by the perch-ladder,\r\n    should be supplied. It will be as well to keep by you a few\r\n    portable doors, so that you may hang one before the entrance to\r\n    a nesting-box, when the hen goes in to sit. This will prevent\r\n    other hens from intruding, a habit to which some are much\r\n    addicted.\r\n\r\nFRICASSEED FOWL OR CHICKEN (an Entree).\r\n\r\n945. INGREDIENTS.--2 small fowls or 1 large one, 3 oz. of butter, a\r\nbunch of parsley and green onions, 1 clove, 2 blades of mace, 1 shalot,\r\n1 bay-leaf, salt and white pepper to taste, 1/4 pint of cream, the yolks\r\nof 3 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose a couple of fat plump chickens, and, after drawing,\r\nsingeing, and washing them, skin, and carve them into joints; blanch\r\nthese in boiling water for 2 or 3 minutes; take them out, and immerse\r\nthem in cold water to render them white. Put the trimmings, with the\r\nnecks and legs, into a stewpan; add the parsley, onions, clove, mace,\r\nshalot, bay-leaf, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; pour to these the\r\nwater that the chickens were blanched in, and simmer gently for rather\r\nmore than 1 hour. Have ready another stewpan; put in the joints of fowl,\r\nwith the above proportion of butter; dredge them with flour, let them\r\nget hot, but do not brown them much; then moisten the fricassee with the\r\ngravy made from the trimmings, &c., and stew very gently for 1/2 hour.\r\nLift the fowl into another stewpan, skim the sauce, reduce it quickly\r\nover the fire, by letting it boil fast, and strain it over them. Add the\r\ncream, and a seasoning of pounded mace and cayenne; let it boil up, and\r\nwhen ready to serve, stir to it the well-beaten yolks of 3 eggs: these\r\nshould not be put in till the last moment, and the sauce should be made\r\n_hot_, but must _not boil_, or it will instantly curdle. A few\r\nbutton-mushrooms stewed with the fowl are by many persons considered an\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour to make the gravy, 1/2 hour to simmer the fowl.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 5s. the pair.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--1 large fowl for one entrée.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    STOCKING THE FOWL-HOUSE.--Take care that the birds with which\r\n    you stock your house are _young_. The surest indications of old\r\n    age are fading of the comb and gills from brilliant red to a\r\n    dingy brick-colour, general paleness of plumage, brittleness of\r\n    the feathers, length and size of the claws, and the scales of\r\n    the legs and feet assuming a ragged and _corny_ appearance. Your\r\n    cock and hens should be as near two years old as possible. Hens\r\n    will lay at a year old, but the eggs are always insignificant in\r\n    size, and the layers giddy and unsteady sitters. The hen-bird is\r\n    in her prime for breeding at three years old, and will continue\r\n    so, under favourable circumstances, for two years longer; after\r\n    which she will decline. Crowing hens, and those that have large\r\n    combs, are generally looked on with mistrust; but this is mere\r\n    silliness and superstition--though it is possible that a spruce\r\n    young cock would as much object to a spouse with such peculiar\r\n    addictions, as a young fellow of our own species would to a\r\n    damsel who whistled and who wore whiskers. Fowls with yellow\r\n    legs should be avoided; they are generally of a tender\r\n    constitution, loose-fleshed, and of indifferent flavour.\r\n\r\nFRICASSEED FOWL (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n946. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 1 strip of\r\nlemon-peel, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, 1 onion,\r\npopper and salt to taste, 1 pint of water, 1 teaspoonful of flour, 1/4\r\npint of cream, the yolks of 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Carve the fowls into nice joints; make gravy of the trimmings\r\nand legs, by stewing them with the lemon-peel, mace, herbs, onion,\r\nseasoning, and water, until reduced to 1/2 pint; then strain, and put in\r\nthe fowl. Warm it through, and thicken with a teaspoonful of flour; stir\r\nthe yolks of the eggs into the cream; add these to the sauce, let it get\r\nthoroughly hot, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour to make the gravy, 1/4 hour to warm the fowl.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold chicken, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    CHARACTERISTICS OF HEALTH AND POWER.--The chief characteristics\r\n    of health in a fowl are brightness and dryness of eye and\r\n    nostrils, the comb and wattles firm and ruddy, the feathers\r\n    elastic and glossy. The most useful cock is generally the\r\n    greatest tyrant, who struts among his hens despotically, with\r\n    his head erect and his eyes ever watchful. There is likely to be\r\n    handsomer and stronger chicks in a house where a bold,\r\n    active--even savage--bird reigns, than where the lord of the\r\n    hen-house is a weak, meek creature, who bears the abuse and\r\n    peckings of his wives without a remonstrance. I much prefer\r\n    dark-coloured cock-birds to those of light plumage. A cock, to\r\n    be handsome, should be of middling size; his bill should be\r\n    short, comb bright-red, wattles large, breast broad, and wings\r\n    strong. His head should be rather small than otherwise, his legs\r\n    short and sturdy, and his spurs well-formed; his feathers should\r\n    be short and close, and the more frequently and heartily he\r\n    crows, the better father he is likely to become. The common\r\n    error of choosing hens _above_ the ordinary stature of their\r\n    respective varieties should be avoided, as the best\r\n    breeding-hens are those of medium size.\r\n\r\nFRIED FOWLS (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n947. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowls, vinegar, salt and\r\ncayenne to taste, 3 or 4 minced shalots. For the batter,--1/2 lb. of\r\nflour, 1/2 pint of hot water, 2 oz. of butter, the whites of 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the fowl into nice joints; steep them for an hour in a\r\nlittle vinegar, with salt, cayenne, and minced shalots. Make the batter\r\nby mixing the flour and water smoothly together; melt in it the butter,\r\nand add the whites of egg beaten to a froth; take out the pieces of\r\nfowl, dip them in the batter, and fry, in boiling lard, a nice brown.\r\nPile them high in the dish, and garnish with fried parsley or rolled\r\nbacon. When approved, a sauce or gravy may be served with them.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to fry the fowl.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold fowl, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    CHANTICLEER AND HIS COMPANIONS.--On bringing the male and female\r\n    birds together for the first time, it will be necessary to watch\r\n    the former closely, as it is a very common occurrence with him\r\n    to conceive a sudden and violent dislike for one or more of his\r\n    wives, and not allow the obnoxious ones to approach within some\r\n    distance of the others; indeed, I know many cases where the\r\n    capricious tyrant has set upon the innocent cause of his\r\n    resentment and killed her outright. In all such cases, the hen\r\n    objected to should be removed and replaced by another. If the\r\n    cock should, by any accident, get killed, considerable delicacy\r\n    is required in introducing a new one. The hens may mope, and\r\n    refuse to associate with their new husband, clustering in\r\n    corners, and making odious comparisons between him and the\r\n    departed; or the cock may have his own peculiar notions as to\r\n    what a wife should be, and be by no means satisfied with those\r\n    you have provided him. The plan is, to keep him by himself\r\n    nearly the whole day, supplying him plentifully with\r\n    exhilarating food, then to turn him loose among the hens, and to\r\n    continue this practice, allowing him more of the society of his\r\n    wives each day, until you suffer him to abide with them\r\n    altogether.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n948. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, vinegar, salt and\r\ncayenne to taste, 4 minced shalots, yolk of egg; to every teacupful of\r\nbread crumbs allow 1 blade of pounded mace, 5 teaspoonful of minced\r\nlemon-peel, 1 saltspoonful of salt, a few grains of cayenne.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Steep the pieces of fowl as in the preceding recipe, then dip\r\nthem into the yolk of an egg or clarified butter; sprinkle over bread\r\ncrumbs with which have been mixed salt, mace, cayenne, and lemon-peel in\r\nthe above proportion. Fry a light brown, and serve with or without\r\ngravy, as may be preferred.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to fry the fowl.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold fowl, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    VARIOUS MODES OF FATTENING FOWLS.--It would, I think, be a\r\n    difficult matter to find, among the entire fraternity of\r\n    fowl-keepers, a dozen whose mode of fattening \"stock\" is the\r\n    same. Some say that the grand f secret is to give them abundance\r\n    of saccharine food; others say nothing beats heavy corn steeped\r\n    in milk; while another breeder, celebrated in his day, and the\r\n    recipient of a gold medal from a learned society, says, \"The\r\n    best method is as follows:-The chickens are to be taken from the\r\n    hen the night after they are hatched, and fed with eggs\r\n    hard-boiled, chopped, and mixed with crumbs of bread, as larks\r\n    and other small birds are fed, for the first fortnight; after\r\n    which give them oatmeal and treacle mixed so as to crumble, of\r\n    which the chickens are very fond, and thrive so fast that, at\r\n    the end of two months, they will be as large as full-grown\r\n    fowls.\" Others there are who insist that nothing beats\r\n    oleaginous diet, and cram their birds with ground oats and suet.\r\n    But, whatever the course of diet favoured, on one point they\r\n    seem agreed; and that is, that, while fattening, the fowls\r\n    _should be kept in the dark_. Supposing the reader to be a\r\n    dealer--a breeder of gross chicken meat for the market (against\r\n    which supposition the chances are 10,000 to 1), and beset with\r\n    as few scruples as generally trouble the huckster, the advice is\r\n    valuable. \"Laugh and grow fat\" is a good maxim enough; but\r\n    \"Sleep and grow fat\" is, as is well known to folks of porcine\r\n    attributes, a better. The poor birds, immured in their dark\r\n    dungeons, ignorant that there is life and sunshine abroad, tuck\r\n    their heads under their wings and make a long night of it; while\r\n    their digestive organs, having no harder work than to pile up\r\n    fat, have an easy time enough. But, unless we are mistaken, he\r\n    who breeds poultry for his own eating, bargains for a more\r\n    substantial reward than the questionable pleasure of burying his\r\n    carving-knife in chicken grease. Tender, delicate, and\r\n    nutritious flesh is the great aim; and these qualities, I can\r\n    affirm without fear of contradiction, were never attained by a\r\n    dungeon-fatted chicken: perpetual gloom and darkness is as\r\n    incompatible with chicken life as it is with human. If you wish\r\n    to be convinced of the absurdity of endeavouring to thwart\r\n    nature's laws, plant a tuft of grass, or a cabbage-plant, in the\r\n    darkest corner of your coal-cellar. The plant or the tuft may\r\n    increase in length and breadth, but its colour will be as wan\r\n    and pale, almost, as would be your own face under the\r\n    circumstances.\r\n\r\nPOULET A LA MARENGO.\r\n\r\n949. INGREDIENTS.--1 large fowl, 4 tablespoonfuls of salad oil, 1\r\ntablespoonful of flour, 1 pint of stock No. 105, or water, about 20\r\nmushroom-buttons, salt and pepper to taste, 1 teaspoonful of powdered\r\nsugar, a very small piece of garlic.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the fowl into 8 or 10 pieces; put them with the oil into a\r\nstewpan, and brown them over a moderate fire; dredge in the above\r\nproportion of flour; when that is browned, pour in the stock or water;\r\nlet it simmer very slowly for rather more than 1/2 hour, and skim off\r\nthe fat as it rises to the top; add the mushrooms; season with salt,\r\npepper, garlic, and sugar; take out the fowl, which arrange\r\npyramidically on the dish, with the inferior joints at the bottom.\r\nReduce the sauce by boiling it quickly over the fire, keeping it stirred\r\nuntil sufficiently thick to adhere to the back of a spoon; pour over the\r\nfowl, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 50 minutes. _Average cost_, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    A FOWL À LA MARENGO.--The following is the origin of the\r\n    well-known dish Poulet à la Marengo:--On the evening of the\r\n    battle the first consul was very hungry after the agitation of\r\n    the day, and a fowl was ordered with all expedition. The fowl\r\n    was procured, but there was no butter at hand, and unluckily\r\n    none could be found in the neighbourhood. There was oil in\r\n    abundance, however; and the cook having poured a certain\r\n    quantity into his skillet, put in the fowl, with a clove of\r\n    garlic and other seasoning, with a little white wine, the best\r\n    the country afforded; he then garnished it with mushrooms, and\r\n    served it up hot. This dish proved the second conquest of the\r\n    day, as the first consul found it most agreeable to his palate,\r\n    and expressed his satisfaction. Ever since, a fowl à la Marengo\r\n    is a favourite dish with all lovers of good cheer.\r\n\r\nMINCED FOWL A LA BECHAMEL.\r\n\r\n950. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 6 tablespoonfuls of\r\nBéchamel sauce No. 367, 6 tablespoonfuls of white stock No. 107, the\r\nwhite of 1 egg, bread crumbs, clarified butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take the remains of roast fowls, mince the white meat very\r\nsmall, and put it into a stewpan with the Béchamel and stock; stir it\r\nwell over the fire, and just let it boil up. Pour the mince into a dish,\r\nbeat up the white of egg, spread it over, and strew on it a few grated\r\nbread crumbs; pour a very little clarified butter on the whole, and\r\nbrown either before the fire or with a salamander. This should be served\r\nin a silver dish, if at hand.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 or 3 minutes to simmer in the sauce.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    THE BEST WAY TO FATTEN FOWLS.--The barn-door fowl is in itself a\r\n    complete refutation of the cramming and dungeon policy of\r\n    feeding practised by some. This fowl, which has the common run\r\n    of the farm-yard, living on dairy-scraps and offal from the\r\n    stable, begins to grow fat at threshing-time. He has his fill of\r\n    the finest corn; he has his fill of fresh air and natural\r\n    exercise, and at last he comes smoking to the table,--a dish\r\n    for the gods. In the matter of unnaturally stuffing and\r\n    confining fowls, Mowbray is exactly of our opinion. He says:\r\n    \"The London chicken-butchers, as they are termed, are said to\r\n    be, of all others, the most expeditious and dexterous feeders,\r\n    putting up a coop of fowls, and making them thoroughly fat\r\n    within the space of a fortnight, using much grease, and that\r\n    perhaps not of the most delicate kind, in the food. In this way\r\n    I have no boasts to make, having always found it necessary to\r\n    allow a considerable number of weeks for the purpose of making\r\n    fowls fat in coops. In the common way this business is often\r\n    badly managed, fowls being huddled together in a small coop,\r\n    tearing each other to pieces, instead of enjoying that repose\r\n    which alone can insure, the wished-for object--irregularly fed\r\n    and cleaned, until they become so stenched and poisoned in their\r\n    own excrement, that their flesh actually smells and tastes when\r\n    smoking upon the table.\" Sussex produces the fattest and largest\r\n    poultry of any county in England, and the fatting process there\r\n    most common is to give them a gruel made of pot-liquor and\r\n    bruised oats, with which are mixed hog's grease, sugar, and\r\n    milk. The fowls are kept very warm, and crammed morning and\r\n    night. They are put into the coop, and kept there two or three\r\n    days before the cramming begins, and then it is continued for a\r\n    fortnight, and the birds are sent to market.\r\n\r\nRAGOUT OF FOWL.\r\n\r\n951. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowls, 3 shalots, 2 blades\r\nof mace, a faggot of savoury herbs, 2 or three slices of lean ham, 1\r\npint of stock or water, pepper and salt to taste, 1 onion, 1\r\ndessertspoonful of flour, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of pounded sugar, 1 oz. of butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the fowls up into neat pieces, the same as for a fricassee;\r\nput the trimmings into a stewpan with the shalots, mace, herbs, ham,\r\nonion, and stock (water may be substituted for this). Boil it slowly for\r\n1 hour, strain the liquor, and put a small piece of butter into a\r\nstewpan; when melted, dredge in sufficient flour to dry up the butter,\r\nand stir it over the fire. Put in the strained liquor, boil for a few\r\nminutes, and strain it again over the pieces of fowl. Squeeze in the\r\nlemon-juice, add the sugar and a seasoning of pepper and salt, make it\r\nhot, but do not allow it to boil; lay the fowl neatly on the dish, and\r\ngarnish with croûtons.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, exclusive of the cold\r\nfowl, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    THE BEST FOWLS TO FATTEN, &c.--The chicks most likely to fatten\r\n    well are those first hatched in the brood, and those with the\r\n    shortest legs. Long-legged fowls, as a rule, are by far the most\r\n    difficult to fatten. The most delicate sort are those which are\r\n    put up to fatten as soon as the hen forsakes them; for, as says\r\n    an old writer, \"then they will be in fine condition, and full of\r\n    flesh, which flesh is afterwards expended in the exercise of\r\n    foraging for food, and in the increase of stature; and it may be\r\n    a work of some weeks to recover it,--especially with young\r\n    cocks.\" But whether you take them in hand as chicks, or not till\r\n    they are older, the three prime rules to be observed are, sound\r\n    and various food, warmth, and cleanliness. There is nothing that\r\n    a fatting fowl grows so fastidious about as his water. If water\r\n    any way foul be offered him, he will not drink it, but sulk with\r\n    his food, and pine, and you all the while wondering the reason\r\n    why. Keep them separate, allowing to each bird as much space as\r\n    you can spare. Spread the ground with sharp sandy gravel; take\r\n    care that they are not disturbed. In addition to their regular\r\n    diet of good corn, make them a cake of ground oats or beans,\r\n    brown sugar, milk, and mutton suet. Let the cake lie till it is\r\n    stale, then crumble it, and give each bird a gill-measureful\r\n    morning and evening. No entire grain should be given to fowls\r\n    during the time they are fattening; indeed, the secret of\r\n    success lies in supplying them with the most nutritious food\r\n    without stint, and in such a form that their digestive mills\r\n    shall find no difficulty in grinding it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST FOWL.]\r\n\r\nROAST FOWLS.\r\n\r\n952. INGREDIENTS.--A pair of fowls; a little flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Fowls to be tender should be killed a couple of days before\r\nthey are dressed; when the feathers come out easily, then let them be\r\npicked and cooked. In drawing them, be careful not to break the\r\ngall-bag, as, wherever it touches, it would impart a very bitter taste;\r\nthe liver and gizzard should also be preserved. Truss them in the\r\nfollowing manner:--After having carefully picked them, cut off the head,\r\nand skewer the skin of the neck down over the back. Cut off the claws;\r\ndip the legs in boiling water, and scrape them; turn the pinions under,\r\nrun a skewer through them and the middle of the legs, which should be\r\npassed through the body to the pinion and leg on the other side, one\r\nskewer securing the limbs on both sides. The liver and gizzard should be\r\nplaced in the wings, the liver on one side and the gizzard on the other.\r\nTie the legs together by passing a trussing-needle, threaded with twine,\r\nthrough the backbone, and secure it on the other side. If trussed like a\r\ncapon, the legs are placed more apart. When firmly trussed, singe them\r\nall over; put them down to a bright clear fire, paper the breasts with a\r\nsheet of buttered paper, and keep the fowls well basted. Roast them for\r\n3/4 hour, more or less, according to the size, and 10 minutes before\r\nserving, remove the paper, dredge the fowls with a little fine flour,\r\nput a piece of butter into the basting-ladle, and as it melts, baste the\r\nfowls with it; when nicely frothed and of a rich colour, serve with good\r\nbrown gravy, a little of which should be poured over the fowls, and a\r\ntureen of well-made bread sauce, No. 371. Mushroom, oyster, or egg sauce\r\nare very suitable accompaniments to roast fowl.--Chicken is roasted in\r\nthe same manner.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A very large fowl, quite 1 hour, medium-sized one 3/4 hour,\r\nchicken 1/2 hour, or rather longer.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 5s. a pair; when scarce, 7s. 6d. the\r\npair.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but scarce in early spring.\r\n\r\n    THE DISEASES OF FOWLS, AND HOW TO CURE THEM.--The diseases to\r\n    which _Gallus domesticus_ is chiefly liable, are roup, pip,\r\n    scouring, and chip. The first-mentioned is the most common of\r\n    all, and results from cold. The ordinary symptoms,--swollen\r\n    eyes, running at the nostrils, and the purple colour of the\r\n    wattles. Part birds so affected from the healthy ones, as, when\r\n    the disease is at its height it is as contagious as glanders\r\n    among horses. Wash out the nostrils with warm water, give daily\r\n    a peppercorn inclosed in dough; bathe the eyes and nostrils with\r\n    warm milk and water. If the head is much swollen, bathe with\r\n    warm brandy and water. When the bird is getting well, put half a\r\n    spoonful of sulphur in his drinking-water. Some fanciers\r\n    prescribe for this disease half a spoonful of table salt,\r\n    dissolved in half a gill of water, in which rue has been\r\n    steeped; others, pills composed of ground rice and fresh butter:\r\n    but the remedy first mentioned will be found far the best. As\r\n    there is a doubt respecting the wholesomeness of the eggs laid\r\n    by roupy hens, it will be as well to throw them away. The pip is\r\n    a white horny skin growing on the tip of the bird's tongue. It\r\n    should be removed with the point of a penknife, and the place\r\n    rubbed with salt.\r\n\r\nFOWL AND RICE CROQUETTES (an Entree).\r\n\r\n953. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of rice, 1 quart of stock or broth, 3 oz. of\r\nbutter, minced fowl, egg, and bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the rice into the above proportion of cold stock or broth,\r\nand let it boil very gently for 1/2 hour; then add the butter, and\r\nsimmer it till quite dry and soft When cold, make it into balls, hollow\r\nout the inside, and fill with minced fowl made by recipe No. 956. The\r\nmince should be rather thick. Cover over with rice, dip the balls into\r\negg, sprinkle them with bread crumbs, and fry a nice brown. Dish them,\r\nand garnish with fried parsley. Oysters, white sauce, or a little cream,\r\nmay be stirred into the rice before it cools.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to boil the rice, 10 minutes to fry the croquettes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the fowl, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    CHIP.--If the birds are allowed to puddle about on wet soil, or\r\n    to be much out in the rain, they will get \"chip.\" Young chicks\r\n    are especially liable to this complaint. They will sit shivering\r\n    in out-of-the-way corners, perpetually uttering a dolorous\r\n    \"chip, chip;\" seemingly frozen with cold, though, on handling\r\n    them, they are found to be in high fever. A wholesale breeder\r\n    would take no pains to attempt the cure of fowls so afflicted;\r\n    but they who keep chickens for the pleasure, and not for the\r\n    profit they yield, will be inclined to recover them if possible.\r\n    Give them none but warm food, half a peppercorn rolled in a\r\n    morsel of dough every night, and a little nitre in their water.\r\n    Above all, keep them warm; a corner in the kitchen fender, for a\r\n    day or two, will do more to effect a cure than the run of a\r\n    druggist's warehouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROQUETTES OF FOWL (an Entree).\r\n\r\n954. INGREDIENTS.--3 or 4 shalots, 1 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of\r\nflour, white sauce; pepper, salt, and pounded mace to taste; 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of pounded sugar, the remains of cold roast fowls, the yolks\r\nof 2 eggs, egg, and bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mince the fowl, carefully removing all skin and bone, and fry\r\nthe shalots in the butter; add the minced fowl, dredge in the flour, put\r\nin the pepper, salt, mace, pounded sugar, and sufficient white sauce to\r\nmoisten it; stir to it the yolks of 2 well-beaten eggs, and set it by to\r\ncool. Then make the mixture up into balls, egg and bread-crumb them, and\r\nfry a nice brown. They may be served on a border of mashed potatoes,\r\nwith gravy or sauce in the centre.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to fry the balls.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    THE TURN.--What is termed \"turrling\" with song-birds, is known,\r\n    as regard fowls, as the \"turn.\" Its origin is the same in both\r\n    cases,--over-feeing and want of exercise. Without a moment's\r\n    warning, a fowl so afflicted will totter and fall from its\r\n    perch, and unless assistance be at hand, speedily give up the\r\n    ghost. The veins of the palate should be opened, and a few drops\r\n    of mixture composed of six parts of sweet nitre and one of\r\n    ammonia, poured down its throat. I have seen ignorant keepers\r\n    plunge a bird, stricken with the \"turn,\" into cold water; but I\r\n    never saw it taken out again alive; and for a good reason: the\r\n    sudden chill has the effect of driving the blood to the\r\n    head,--of aggravating the disease indeed, instead of relieving\r\n    it.\r\n\r\nHASHED FOWL--an Entree (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n955. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 1 pint of water, 1\r\nonion, 2 or three small carrots, 1 blade of pounded mace, pepper and\r\nsalt to taste, 1 small bunch of savoury herbs, thickening of butter and\r\nflour, 1-1/2 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut off the best joints from the fowl, and the remainder make\r\ninto gravy, by adding to the bones and trimmings a pint of water, an\r\nonion sliced and fried of a nice brown, the carrots, mace, seasoning,\r\nand herbs. Let these stew gently for 1-1/2 hour, strain the liquor, and\r\nthicken with a little flour and butter. Lay in the fowl, thoroughly warm\r\nit through, add the ketchup, and garnish with sippets of toasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1-3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold fowl, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    SKIN-DISEASE IN FOWLS.--Skin-disease is, nine times out of ten,\r\n    caused by the feathers being swarmed by parasites. Poor feeding\r\n    will induce this, even if cleanliness be observed;\r\n    uncleanliness, however liberal the bill of fare, will be taken\r\n    as an invitation by the little biting pests, and heartily\r\n    responded to. Mix half a teaspoonful of hydro-oxalic acid with\r\n    twelve teaspoonfuls of water,--apply to the itching parts with\r\n    an old shaving-brush.\r\n\r\n    OBSTRUCTION OF THE CROP.--Obstruction of the crop is occasioned\r\n    by weakness or greediness. You may know when a bird is so\r\n    afflicted by his crop being distended almost to bursting.\r\n    Mowbray tells of a hen of his in this predicament; when the crop\r\n    was opened, a quantity of new beans were discovered in a state\r\n    of vegetation. The crop should be slit from the _bottom_ to the\r\n    _top_ with a sharp pair of scissors, the contents taken out, and\r\n    the slit sewed up again with line white thread.\r\n\r\nMINCED FOWL--an Entree (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n956. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 2 hard-boiled eggs,\r\nsalt, cayenne, and pounded mace, 1 onion, 1 faggot of savoury herbs, 6\r\ntablespoonfuls of cream, 1 oz. of butter, two teaspoonfuls of flour, 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of finely-minced lemon-peel, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut out from the fowl all the white meat, and mince it finely\r\nwithout any skin or bone; put the bones, skin, and trimmings into a\r\nstewpan with an onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, a blade of mace, and\r\nnearly a pint of water; let this stew for an hour, then strain the\r\nliquor. Chop the eggs small; mix them with the fowl; add salt, cayenne,\r\nand pounded mace, put in the gravy and remaining ingredients; let the\r\nwhole just boil, and serve with sippets of toasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the fowl, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Another way to make this is to mince the fowl, and warm it in\r\nwhite sauce or Béchamel. When dressed like this, 3 or 4 poached eggs may\r\nbe placed on the top: oysters, or chopped mushrooms, or balls of oyster\r\nforcemeat, may be laid round the dish.\r\n\r\n    THE MOULTING SEASON.--During the moulting season beginning\r\n    properly at the end of September, the fowls will require a\r\n    little extra attention. Keep them dry and warm, and feed them\r\n    liberally on warm and satisfying food. If in any fowl the moult\r\n    should seem protracted, examine it for broken feather-stumps\r\n    still beaded in the skin: if you find any, extract them\r\n    carefully with a pair of tweezers. If a fowl is hearty and\r\n    strong, six weeks will see him out of his trouble; if he is\r\n    weakly, or should take cold during the time, he will not\r\n    thoroughly recover in less than three months. It is seldom or\r\n    ever that hens will lay during the moult; while the cock, during\r\n    the same period, will give so little of his consideration to the\r\n    frivolities of love, that you may as well, nay, much better,\r\n    keep him by himself till he perfectly recovers. A moulting\r\n    chicken makes but a sorry dish.\r\n\r\nHASHED FOWL, Indian Fashion (an Entree).\r\n\r\n957.--INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 3 or 4 sliced\r\nonions, 1 apple, 2 oz. of butter, pounded mace, pepper and salt to\r\ntaste, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1\r\ntablespoonful of flour, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 1 pint of gravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the onions into slices, mince the apple, and fry these in\r\nthe butter; add pounded mace, pepper, salt, curry-powder, vinegar,\r\nflour, and sugar in the above proportions; when the onion is brown, put\r\nit the gravy, which should be previously made from the bones and\r\ntrimmings of the fowls, and stew for 3/4 hour; add the fowl cut into\r\nnice-sized joints, let it warm through, and when quite tender, serve.\r\nThe dish should be garnished with au edging of boiled rice.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. Average cost, exclusive of the fowl, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    THE SCOUR OR DYSENTERY.--The scour, or dysentery, or diarrhoea,\r\n    is induced variously. A sudden alteration in diet will cause it,\r\n    as will a superabundance of green food. The best remedy is a\r\n    piece of toasted biscuit sopped in ale. If the disease has too\r\n    tight a hold on the bird to be quelled by this, give six drops\r\n    of syrup of white poppies and six drops of castor-oil, mixed\r\n    with a little oatmeal or ground rice. Restrict the bird's diet,\r\n    for a few days, to dry food,--crushed beans or oats, stale\r\n    bread-crumbs, &c.\r\n\r\n    FOWL SCOLLOPS (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n    958. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled fowl, 1/2\r\n    pint of Béchamel, No. 367, or white sauce, No. 537 or 539.\r\n\r\n    _Mode_.--Strip off the skin from the fowl; cut the meat into\r\n    thin slices, and warm them in about 1/2 pint, or rather more, of\r\n    Béchamel, or white sauce. When quite hot, serve, and garnish the\r\n    dish with rolled ham or bacon toasted.\r\n\r\n    _Time_.--1 minute to simmer the slices of fowl.\r\n\r\n    _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FEATHER LEGGED BANTAM.]\r\n\r\n    THE FEATHER LEGGED BANTAM.--Since the introduction of the Bantam\r\n    into Europe, it has ramified into many varieties, none of which\r\n    are destitute of elegance, and some, indeed, remarkable for\r\n    their beauty. All are, or ought to be, of small size, but lively\r\n    and vigorous, exhibiting in their movements both grace and\r\n    stateliness. The variety shown in the engraving is remarkable\r\n    for the _tarsi_, or beams of the legs, being plumed to the toes,\r\n    with stiff, long feathers, which brush the ground. Owing,\r\n    possibly, to the little care taken to preserve this variety from\r\n    admixture, it is now not frequently seen. Another variety is\r\n    often red, with a black breast and single dentated comb. The\r\n    _tarsi_ are smooth, and of a dusky blue. When this sort of\r\n    Bantam is pure, it yields in courage and spirit to none, and is,\r\n    in fact, a game-fowl in miniature, being as beautiful and\r\n    graceful as it is spirited. A pure white Bantam, possessing all\r\n    the qualifications just named, is also bred in the royal aviary\r\n    at Windsor.\r\n\r\nAN INDIAN DISH OF FOWL (an Entree).\r\n\r\n959. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 3 or 4 sliced onions,\r\n1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Divide the fowl into joints; slice and fry the onions in a\r\nlittle butter, taking care not to burn them; sprinkle over the fowl a\r\nlittle curry-powder and salt; fry these nicely, pile them high in the\r\ncentre of the dish, cover with the onion, and serve with a cut lemon on\r\na plate. Care must be taken that the onions are not greasy: they should\r\nbe quite dry, but not burnt.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes to fry the onions, 10 minutes to fry the fowl.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the fowl, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ during the winter month.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPECKLED HAMBURGS.]\r\n\r\n    THE SPECKLED HAMBURG.--Of the speckled, or spangled Hamburg\r\n    which is a favourite breed with many persons, there are two\r\n    varieties,--the golden-speckled and the silver-speckled. The\r\n    general colour of the former is golden, or orange-yellow, each\r\n    feather having a glossy dark brown or black tip, particularly\r\n    remarkable on the hackles of the cock and the wing-coverts, and\r\n    also on the darker feathers of the breast. The female is yellow,\r\n    or orange-brown, the feathers in like manner being margined with\r\n    black. The silver-speckled variety is distinguished by the\r\n    ground-colour of the plumage being of a silver-white, with\r\n    perhaps a tinge of straw-yellow, every leather being margined\r\n    with a semi-lunar mark of glossy black. Both of these varieties\r\n    are extremely beautiful, the hens laying freely. First-rate\r\n    birds command a high price.\r\n\r\nFOWL SAUTE WITH PEAS (an Entree).\r\n\r\n960. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowl, 2 oz. of butter,\r\npepper, salt, and pounded mace to taste, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1/2\r\npint of weak stock, 1 pint of green peas, 1 teaspoonful of pounded\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the fowl into nice pieces; put the butter into a stew-pan;\r\nsautez or fry the fowl a nice brown colour, previously sprinkling it\r\nwith pepper, salt, and pounded mace. Dredge in the flour, shake the\r\ningredients well round, then add the stock and peas, and stew till the\r\nlatter are tender, which will be in about 20 minutes; put in the pounded\r\nsugar, and serve, placing the chicken round, and the peas in the middle\r\nof the dish. When liked, mushrooms may be substituted for the peas.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 40 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the fowl, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to August.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUDIN A LA REINE (an Entree).\r\n\r\n(M. Ude's Recipe.)\r\n\r\n961. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast fowls, 1 pint of Béchamel\r\nNo. 367, salt and cayenne to taste, egg and bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take the breasts and nice white meat from the fowls; cut it\r\ninto small dice of an equal size, and throw them into some good\r\nBéchamel, made by recipe No. 367; season with salt and cayenne, and put\r\nthe mixture into a dish to cool. When this preparation is quite cold,\r\ncut it into 2 equal parts, which should be made into _boudins_ of a long\r\nshape, the size of the dish they are intended to be served on; roll them\r\nin flour, egg and bread-crumb them, and be careful that the ends are\r\nwell covered with the crumbs, otherwise they would break in the\r\nfrying-pan; fry them a nice colour, put them before the fire to drain\r\nthe greasy moisture from them, and serve with the remainder of the\r\nBéchamel poured round: this should be thinned with a little stock.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to fry the boudins.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the fowl, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 entrée.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEBRIGHT BANTAMS.]\r\n\r\n    SIR JOHN SEBRIGHT'S BANTAMS.--Above all Bantams is placed, the\r\n    celebrated and beautiful breed called Sir John Sebright's Silver\r\n    Bantams. This breed, which Sir John brought to perfection after\r\n    years of careful trials, is very small, with un-feathered legs,\r\n    and a rose comb and short hackles. The plumage is gold or\r\n    silver, spangled, every feather being of a golden orange, or of\r\n    a silver white, with a glossy jet-black margin; the cocks have\r\n    the tail folded like that of a hen, with the sickle feathers\r\n    shortened straight, or nearly so, and broader than usual. The\r\n    term _hen-cocks_ is, in consequence, often applied to them; but\r\n    although the sickle feathers are thus modified, no bird\r\n    possesses higher courage, or a more gallant carriage. The\r\n    attitude of the cock is, indeed, singularly proud; and he is\r\n    often seen to bear himself so haughtily, that his head, thrown\r\n    back as if in disdain, nearly touches the two upper\r\n    feathers--sickles they can scarcely be called--of his tail.\r\n    Half-bred birds of this kind are not uncommon, but birds of the\r\n    pure breed are not to be obtained without trouble and expense;\r\n    indeed, some time ago, it was almost impossible to procure\r\n    either a fowl or an egg. \"The finest,\" says the writer whom we\r\n    have consulted as to this breed, \"we have ever seen, were in Sir\r\n    John's poultry-yard, adjacent to Turnham-Green Common, in the\r\n    byroad leading to Acton.\"\r\n\r\nFOWL A LA MAYONNAISE.\r\n\r\n962. INGREDIENTS.--A cold roast fowl, Mayonnaise sauce No. 468, 4 or 5\r\nyoung lettuces, 4 hard-boiled eggs, a few water-cresses, endive.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the fowl into neat joints, lay them in a deep dish, piling\r\nthem high in the centre, sauce the fowl with Mayonnaise made by recipe\r\nNo. 468, and garnish the dish with young lettuces cut in halves,\r\nwater-cresses, endive, and hard-boiled eggs: these may be sliced in\r\nrings, or laid on the dish whole, cutting off at the bottom a piece of\r\nthe white, to make the egg stand. All kinds of cold meat and solid fish\r\nmay be dressed à la Mayonnaise, and make excellent luncheon or supper\r\ndishes. The sauce should not be poured over the fowls until the moment\r\nof serving. Should a very large Mayonnaise be required, use 2 fowls\r\ninstead of 1, with an equal proportion of the remaining ingredients.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with one fowl, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a moderate-sized dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to September.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK SPANISH.]\r\n\r\n    BLACK SPANISH.--The real Spanish fowl is recognized by its\r\n    uniformly black colour burnished with tints of green; its\r\n    peculiar white face, and the large development of its comb and\r\n    wattle. The hens are excellent layers, and their eggs are of a\r\n    very large size. They are, however, bad nurses; consequently,\r\n    their eggs should be laid in the nest of other varieties to be\r\n    hatched. \"In purchasing Spanish,\" says an authority, \"blue legs,\r\n    the entire absence of white or coloured feathers in the plumage,\r\n    and a large, white face, with a very large high comb, which\r\n    should be erect in the cock, though pendent in the hens, should\r\n    be insisted on.\" The flesh of this fowl is esteemed; but, from\r\n    the smallness of its body when compared with that of the\r\n    Dorking, it is not placed on an equality with it for the table.\r\n    Otherwise, however, they are profitable birds, and their\r\n    handsome carriage, and striking contrast of colour in the comb,\r\n    face, and plumage, are a high recommendation to them as kept\r\n    fowls. For a town fowl, they are perhaps better adapted than any\r\n    other variety.\r\n\r\nFOWL PILLAU, based on M. Soyer's Recipe (an Indian Dish).\r\n\r\n963. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of rice, 2 oz. of butter, a fowl, 2 quarts of\r\nstock or good broth, 40 cardamum-seeds, 1/2 oz. of coriander-seed, 1/4\r\noz. of cloves, 1/4 oz. of allspice, 1/4 oz. of mace, 1/4 oz. of\r\ncinnamon, 1/2 oz. of peppercorns, 4 onions, 6 thin slices of bacon, 2\r\nhard-boiled eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Well wash 1 lb. of the best Patna rice, put it into a\r\nfrying-pan with the butter, which keep moving over a slow fire until the\r\nrice is lightly browned. Truss the fowl as for boiling, put it into a\r\nstewpan with the stock or broth; pound the spices and seeds thoroughly\r\nin a mortar, tie them in a piece of muslin, and put them in with the\r\nfowl. Let it boil slowly until it is nearly done; then add the rice,\r\nwhich should stew until quite tender and almost dry; cut the onions into\r\nslices, sprinkle them with flour, and fry, without breaking them, of a\r\nnice brown colour. Have ready the slices of bacon curled and grilled,\r\nand the eggs boiled hard. Lay the fowl in the form of a pyramid upon a\r\ndish, smother with the rice, garnish with the bacon, fried onions, and\r\nthe hard-boiled eggs cut into quarters, and serve very hot. Before\r\ntaking the rice out, remove the spices.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to stew the fowl without the rice; 1/2 hour with it.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4s. 3d. _Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SULTANS.]\r\n\r\n    THE SERAI TA-OOK, OR FOWLS OF THE SULTAN.--This fowl is the size\r\n    of our English Polands, and is the latest species introduced to\r\n    England. They have a white and flowing plumage, a full-sized,\r\n    compact Poland tuft on the head, are muffed, have a full flowing\r\n    tail, short legs well feathered, and five toes upon each foot.\r\n    Their comb consists merely of two little points, and their\r\n    wattles are very small: their colour is that of a pure white. In\r\n    January, 1854, they arrived in this country from Constantinople;\r\n    and they take their name from _sarai_, the Turkish word for\r\n    sultan's palace, and _ta-ook_, the Turkish for fowl. They are\r\n    thus called the \"fowls of the sultan,\" a name which has the\r\n    twofold advantage of being the nearest to be found to that by\r\n    which they have been known in their own country, and of\r\n    designating the country whence they come. Their habits are\r\n    described as being generally brisk and happy-tempered, but not\r\n    so easily kept in as Cochin-Chinas. They are excellent layers;\r\n    but they are non-sitters and small eaters: their eggs are large\r\n    and white. Brahmas or Cochins will clear the crop of a grass-run\r\n    long before they will, and, with scattered food, they soon\r\n    satisfy themselves and walk away.\r\n\r\nPOULET AUX CRESSONS.\r\n\r\n964. INGREDIENTS.--A fowl, a large bunch of water-cresses, 3\r\ntablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1/4 pint of gravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Truss and roast a fowl by recipe No. 952, taking care that it\r\nis nicely frothed and brown. Wash and dry the water-cresses, pick them\r\nnicely, and arrange them in a flat layer on a dish. Sprinkle over a\r\nlittle salt and the above proportion of vinegar; place over these the\r\nfowl, and pour over it the gravy. A little gravy should be served in a\r\ntureen. When not liked, the vinegar may be omitted.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 1/2 to 1 hour, according to size.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 2s. 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\nROAST FOWL, Stuffed.\r\n\r\n965. INGREDIENTS.--A large fowl, forcemeat No. 417, a little flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Select a large plump fowl, fill the breast with forcemeat, made\r\nby recipe No. 417, truss it firmly, the same as for a plain roast fowl,\r\ndredge it with flour, and put it down to a bright fire. Roast it for\r\nnearly or quite an hour, should it be very large; remove the skewers,\r\nand serve with a good brown gravy and a tureen of bread sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Large fowl, nearly or quite 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 2s. 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but scarce in early spring.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Sausage-meat stuffing may be substituted for the above: this is\r\nnow a very general mode of serving fowl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PENCILLED HAMBURG.]\r\n\r\n    PENCILLED HAMBURG.--This variety of the Hamburg fowl is of two\r\n    colours, golden and silver, and is very minutely marked. The\r\n    hens of both should have the body clearly pencilled across with\r\n    several bars of black, and the hackle in both, sexes should be\r\n    perfectly free from dark marks. The cocks do not exhibit the\r\n    pencillings, but are white or brown in the golden or silver\r\n    birds respectively. Their form is compact, and their attitudes\r\n    graceful and sprightly. The hens do not sit, but lay extremely\r\n    well; hence one of their common names, that of Dutch every-day\r\n    layers. They are also known in different parts of the country,\r\n    as Chitteprats, Creoles, or Corals, Bolton bays and grays, and,\r\n    in some parts of Yorkshire, by the wrong name of Corsican fowls.\r\n    They are imported in large numbers from Holland, but those bred\r\n    in this country are greatly superior in size.\r\n\r\nGIBLET PIE.\r\n\r\n966. INGREDIENTS.--A set of duck or goose giblets, 1 lb. of rump-steak,\r\n1 onion, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole black pepper, a bunch of savoury\r\nherbs, plain crust.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clean, and put the giblets into a stewpan with an onion, whole\r\npepper, and a bunch of savoury herbs; add rather more than a pint of\r\nwater, and simmer gently for about 1-1/2 hour. Take them out, let them\r\ncool, and cut them into pieces; line the bottom of a pie-dish with a few\r\npieces of rump-steak; add a layer of giblets and a few more pieces of\r\nsteak; season with pepper and salt, and pour in the gravy (which should\r\nbe strained), that the giblets were stewed in; cover with a plain crust,\r\nand bake for rather more than 1-1/2 hour in a brisk oven. Cover a piece\r\nof paper over the pie, to prevent the crust taking too much colour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour to stew the giblets, about 1 hour to bake the pie.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the giblets, 1s. 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n    THE BRENT GOOSE.--This is the smallest and most numerous species\r\n    of the geese which visit the British islands. It makes its\r\n    appearance in winter, and ranges over the whole of the coasts\r\n    and estuaries frequented by other migrant geese. Mr. Selby\r\n    states that a very large body of these birds annually resort to\r\n    the extensive sandy and muddy flats which lie between the\r\n    mainland and Holy Island, on the Northumbrian coast, and which\r\n    are covered by every flow of the tide. This part of the coast\r\n    appears to have been a favourite resort of these birds from time\r\n    immemorial, where they have always received the name of Ware\r\n    geese, no doubt from their continually feeding on marine\r\n    vegetables. Their flesh is very agreeable.\r\n\r\nHASHED GOOSE.\r\n\r\n967. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast goose, 2 onions, 2 oz. of\r\nbutter, 1 pint of boiling water, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, pepper and\r\nsalt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of port wine, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\nmushroom ketchup.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the goose into pieces of the size required; the inferior\r\njoints, trimmings, &c., put into a stewpan to make the gravy; slice and\r\nfry the onions in the butter of a very pale brown; add these to the\r\ntrimmings, and pour over about a pint of boiling water; stew these\r\ngently for 3/4 hour, then skim and strain the liquor. Thicken it with\r\nflour, and flavour with port wine and ketchup, in the above proportion;\r\nadd a seasoning of pepper and salt, and put in the pieces of goose; let\r\nthese get thoroughly hot through, but do not allow them to boil, and\r\nserve with sippets of toasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, rather more than 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold goose, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n    THE WILD GOOSE.--This bird is sometimes called the \"Gray-lag\"\r\n    and is the original of the domestic goose. It is, according to\r\n    Pennant, the only species which the Britons could take young,\r\n    and familiarize. \"The Gray-lag,\" says Mr. Gould, \"is known to\r\n    Persia, and we believe it is generally dispersed over Asia\r\n    Minor.\" It is the bird that saved the Capitol by its vigilance,\r\n    and by the Romans was cherished accordingly.\r\n\r\nROAST GOOSE.\r\n\r\n968. INGREDIENTS.--Goose, 4 large onions, 10 sage-leaves, 1/4 lb. of\r\nbread crumbs, 1-1/2 oz. of butter, salt and pepper to taste, 1 egg.\r\n\r\n_Choosing and Trussing_.--Select a goose with a clean white skin, plump\r\nbreast, and yellow feet: if these latter are red, the bird is old.\r\nShould the weather permit, let it hang for a few days: by so doing, the\r\nflavour will be very much improved. Pluck, singe, draw, and carefully\r\nwash and wipe the goose; cut off the neck close to the back, leaving the\r\nskin long enough to turn over; cut off the feet at the first joint, and\r\nseparate the pinions at the first joint. Beat the breast-bone flat with\r\na rolling-pin, put a skewer through the under part of each wing, and\r\nhaving drawn up the legs closely, put a skewer into the middle of each,\r\nand pass the same quite through the body. Insert another skewer into the\r\nsmall of the leg, bring it close down to the side bone, run it through,\r\nand do the same to the other side. Now cut off the end of the vent, and\r\nmake a hole in the skin sufficiently large for the passage of the rump,\r\nin order to keep in the seasoning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST GOOSE.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a sage-and-onion stuffing of the above ingredients, by\r\nrecipe No. 504; put it into the body of the goose, and secure it firmly\r\nat both ends, by passing the rump through the hole made in the skin, and\r\nthe other end by tying the skin of the neck to the back; by this means\r\nthe seasoning will not escape. Put it down to a brisk fire, keep it well\r\nbasted, and roast from 1-1/2 to 2 hours, according to the size. Remove\r\nthe skewers, and serve with a tureen of good gravy, and one of well-made\r\napple-sauce. Should a very highly-flavoured seasoning be preferred, the\r\nonions should not be parboiled, but minced raw: of the two methods, the\r\nmild seasoning is far superior. A ragoût, or pie, should be made of the\r\ngiblets, or they may be stewed down to make gravy. Be careful to serve\r\nthe goose before the breast falls, or its appearance will be spoiled by\r\ncoming flattened to table. As this is rather a troublesome joint to\r\ncarve, a _large_ quantity of gravy should not be poured round the goose,\r\nbut sent in a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A large goose, 1-3/4 hour; a moderate-sized one, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March; but in perfection from Michaelmas\r\nto Christmas.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 5s. 6d. each. _Sufficient_ for 8 or 9 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A teaspoonful of made mustard, a saltspoonful of salt, a few\r\ngrains of cayenne, mixed with a glass of port wine, are sometimes poured\r\ninto the goose by a slit made in the apron. This sauce is, by many\r\npersons, considered an improvement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMDEN GOOSE.]\r\n\r\n    THE GOOSE.--This bird is pretty generally distributed over the\r\n    face of the globe, being met with in North America, Lapland,\r\n    Iceland, Arabia, and Persia. Its varieties are numerous; but in\r\n    England there is only one species, which is supposed to be a\r\n    native breed. The best geese are found on the borders of\r\n    Suffolk, and in Norfolk and Berkshire; but the largest flocks\r\n    are reared in the fens of Lincolnshire and Cambridge. They\r\n    thrive best where they have an easy access to water, and large\r\n    herds of them are sent every year to London, to be fattened by\r\n    the metropolitan poulterers. \"A Michaelmas goose,\" says Dr.\r\n    Kitchener, \"is as famous in the mouths of the million as the\r\n    minced-pie at Christmas; yet for those who eat with delicacy, it\r\n    is, at that time, too full-grown. The true period when the goose\r\n    is in the highest perfection is when it has just acquired its\r\n    full growth, and not begun to harden; if the March goose is\r\n    insipid, the Michaelmas goose is rank. The fine time is between\r\n    both; from the second week in June to the first in September.\"\r\n    It is said that the Michaelmas goose is indebted to Queen\r\n    Elizabeth for its origin on the table at that season. Her\r\n    majesty happened to dine on one at the table of an English\r\n    baronet, when she received the news of the discomfiture of the\r\n    Spanish Armada. In commemoration of this event, she commanded\r\n    the goose to make its appearance at table on every Michaelmas.\r\n    We here give an engraving of the Emden goose.\r\n\r\nTO DRESS A GREEN GOOSE.\r\n\r\n969. INGREDIENTS.--Goose, 3 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Geese are called green till they are about four months old, and\r\nshould not be stuffed. After it has been singed and trussed, the same as\r\nin the preceding recipe, put into the body a seasoning of pepper and\r\nsalt, and the butter to moisten it inside. Roast before a clear fire for\r\nabout 3/4 hour, froth and brown it nicely, and serve with a brown gravy,\r\nand, when liked, gooseberry-sauce. This dish should be garnished with\r\nwater-cresses.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 4s. 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in June, July, and August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOULOUSE GOOSE.]\r\n\r\n    THE EGYPTIAN GOOSE.--Especial attention has been directed to\r\n    this bird by Herodotus, who says it was held sacred by the\r\n    ancient Egyptians, which has been partially confirmed by modern\r\n    travellers. Mr. Salt remarks, \"Horus Apollo says the old geese\r\n    stay with their young in the most imminent danger, at the risk\r\n    of their own lives, which I have myself frequently witnessed.\r\n    Vielpanser is the goose of the Nile, and wherever this goose is\r\n    represented on the walls of the temples in colours, the\r\n    resemblance may be clearly traced.\" The goose is also said to\r\n    have been a bird under the care of Isis. It has been placed by\r\n    Mr. Gould amongst the birds of Europe; not from the number of\r\n    half-reclaimed individuals which are annually shot in Britain,\r\n    but from the circumstance of its occasionally visiting the\r\n    southern parts of the continent from its native country, Africa.\r\n    The Toulouse goose, of which we give an engraving, is a\r\n    well-known bird.\r\n\r\nROAST GUINEA-FOWL, Larded.\r\n\r\n970. INGREDIENTS.--A Guinea-fowl, lardoons, flour, and salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--When this bird is larded, it should be trussed the same as a\r\npheasant; if plainly roasted, truss it like a turkey. After larding and\r\ntrussing it, put it down to roast at a brisk fire; keep it well basted,\r\nand a short time before serving, dredge it with a little flour, and let\r\nit froth nicely. Serve with a little gravy in the dish, and a tureen of\r\nthe same, and one of well-made bread-sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Guinea-fowl, larded, 1-1/4 hour; plainly roasted, about 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The breast, if larded, should be covered with a piece of paper,\r\nand removed about 10 minutes before serving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUINEA-FOWLS.]\r\n\r\n    THE GUINEA-FOWL.--The bird takes its name from Guinea, in\r\n    Africa, where it is found--wild, and in great abundance. It is\r\n    gregarious in its habits, associating in flocks of two or three\r\n    hundred, delighting in marshy grounds, and at night perching\r\n    upon trees, or on high situations. Its size is about the same as\r\n    that of a common hen, but it stands higher on its legs. Though\r\n    domesticated, it retains much of its wild nature, and is apt to\r\n    wander. The hens lay abundantly, and the eggs are excellent. In\r\n    their flesh, however, they are not so white as the common fowl,\r\n    but more inclined to the colour of the pheasant, for which it\r\n    frequently makes a good substitute at table. The flesh is both\r\n    savoury and easy of digestion, and is in season when game is out\r\n    of season.\r\n\r\nLARK PIE (an Entree).\r\n\r\n971. INGREDIENTS.--A few thin slices of beef, the same of bacon, 9\r\nlarks, flour; for stuffing, 1 teacupful of bread crumbs, 1/2 teaspoonful\r\nof minced lemon-peel, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, 1 egg, salt and\r\npepper to taste, 1 teaspoonful of chopped shalot, 1/2 pint of weak stock\r\nor water, puff-paste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a stuffing of bread crumbs, minced lemon-peel, parsley,\r\nand the yolk of an egg, all of which should be well mixed together; roll\r\nthe larks in flour, and stuff them. Line the bottom of a pie-dish with a\r\nfew slices of beef and bacon; over these place the larks, and season\r\nwith salt, pepper, minced parsley, and chopped shalot, in the above\r\nproportion. Pour in the stock or water, cover with crust, and bake for\r\nan hour in a moderate oven. During the time the pie is baking, shake it\r\n2 or 3 times, to assist in thickening the gravy, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d. a dozen.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--In full season in November.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST LARKS.\r\n\r\n972. INGREDIENTS.--Larks, egg and bread crumbs, fresh butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--These birds are by many persons esteemed a great delicacy, and\r\nmay be either roasted or broiled. Pick, gut, and clean them; when they\r\nare trussed, brush them over with the yolk of an egg; sprinkle with\r\nbread crumbs, and roast them before a quick fire; baste them continually\r\nwith fresh butter, and keep sprinkling with the bread crumbs until the\r\nbirds are well covered. Dish them on bread crumbs fried in clarified\r\nbutter, and garnish the dish with slices of lemon. Broiled larks are\r\nalso very excellent: they should be cooked over a clear fire, and would\r\ntake about 10 minutes or 1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to roast; 10 minutes to broil.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--In full season in November.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Larks may also be plainly roasted, without covering them with\r\negg and bread crumbs; they should be dished on fried crumbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED PIGEONS.\r\n\r\n973. INGREDIENTS.--Pigeons, 3 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take care that the pigeons are quite fresh, and carefully\r\npluck, draw, and wash them; split the backs, rub the birds over with\r\nbutter, season them with pepper and salt, and broil them over a moderate\r\nfire for 1/4 hour or 20 minutes. Serve very hot, with either\r\nmushroom-sauce or a good gravy. Pigeons may also be plainly boiled, and\r\nserved with parsley and butter; they should be trussed like boiled\r\nfowls, and take from 1/4 hour to 20 minutes to boil.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To broil a pigeon, from 1/4 hour to 20 minutes; to boil one,\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 6d. to 9d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to September, but in the greatest perfection\r\nfrom midsummer to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n    THE POUTER PIGEON.--This is a very favourite pigeon, and,\r\n    without doubt, the most curious of his species. He is a tail\r\n    strong bird, as he had need be to carry about his great inflated\r\n    crop, frequently as large and as round as a middling-sized\r\n    turnip. A perfect pouter, seen on a windy day, is certainly a\r\n    ludicrous sight: his feathered legs have the appearance of white\r\n    trousers; his tapering tail looks like a swallow-tailed coat;\r\n    his head is entirely concealed by his immense windy\r\n    protuberance; and, altogether, he reminds you of a little\r\n    \"swell\" of a past century, staggering under a bale of linen. The\r\n    most common pouters are the blues, buffs, and whites, or an\r\n    intermixture of all these various colours. The pouter is not a\r\n    prolific breeder, is a bad nurse, and more likely to degenerate,\r\n    if not repeatedly crossed and re-crossed with Irish stock, than\r\n    any other pigeon: nevertheless, it is a useful bird to keep if\r\n    you are founding a new colony, as it is much attached to its\r\n    home, and little apt to stray; consequently it is calculated to\r\n    induce more restless birds to fettle down and make themselves\r\n    comfortable. If you wish to breed pouters, you cannot do worse\r\n    than intrust them with the care of their own eggs.\r\n\r\nROAST PIGEONS.\r\n\r\n974. INGREDIENTS.--Pigeons, 3 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Trussing_.--Pigeons, to be good, should be eaten fresh (if kept a\r\nlittle, the flavour goes off), and they should be drawn as soon as\r\nkilled. Cut off the heads and necks, truss the wings over the backs, and\r\ncut off the toes at the first joint: previous to trussing, they should\r\nbe carefully cleaned, as no bird requires so much washing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST PIGEON.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wipe the birds very dry, season them inside with pepper and\r\nsalt, and put about 3/4 oz. of butter into the body of each: this makes\r\nthem moist. Put them down to a bright fire, and baste them well the\r\nwhole of the time they are cooking (they will be done enough in from 20\r\nto 30 minutes); garnish with fried parsley, and serve with a tureen of\r\nparsley and butter. Bread-sauce and gravy, the same as for roast fowl,\r\nare exceedingly nice accompaniments to roast pigeons, as also egg-sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 20 minutes to 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 6d. to 9d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to September; but in the greatest perfection\r\nfrom Midsummer to Michaelmas.\r\n\r\n    THE PIGEON--The pigeon tribe forms a connecting ling between the\r\n    passerine birds and poultry. They are widely distributed over\r\n    the world, some of the species being found even in the arctic\r\n    regions. Their chief food is grain, and they drink much; not at\r\n    intervals, like other birds, but by a continuous draught, like\r\n    quadrupeds. The wild pigeon, or stockdove, is the parent whence\r\n    all the varieties of the domestic pigeon are derived. In the\r\n    wild state it is still found in many parts of this island,\r\n    making its nest in the holes of rocks, in the hollows of trees,\r\n    or in old towers, but never, like the ringdove, on branches. The\r\n    blue house-pigeon is the variety principally reared for the\r\n    table in this country, and is produced from our farmyards in\r\n    great numbers. When young, and still fed by their parents, they\r\n    are most preferable for the table, and are called _squabs_;\r\n    under six months they are denominated _squeakers_, and at six\r\n    months they begin to breed. Their flesh is accounted savoury,\r\n    delicate, and stimulating, and the dark-coloured birds are\r\n    considered to have the highest flavour, whilst the light are\r\n    esteemed to have the more delicate flesh.\r\n\r\n    THE PIGEON-HOUSE, OR DOVECOT.--The first thing to be done\r\n    towards keeping pigeons is to provide a commodious place for\r\n    their reception; and the next is, to provide the pigeons\r\n    themselves. The situation or size of the dovecot will\r\n    necessarily depend on convenience; but there is one point which\r\n    must invariably be observed, and that is, that every pair of\r\n    pigeons has two holes or rooms to nest in. This is\r\n    indispensable, as, without it, there will be no security, but\r\n    the constant prospect of confusion, breaking of eggs, and the\r\n    destruction of young. The proper place for the pigeon-house is\r\n    the poultry-yard; but it does very well near dwellings, stables,\r\n    brewhouses, bakehouses, or such offices. Some persons keep\r\n    pigeons in rooms, and have them making their nests on the floor.\r\n    The object is to escape the danger of the young falling out; but\r\n    in such cases, there is a great risk of rats or other vermin\r\n    getting at the pigeons.\r\n\r\n    ASPECT OF THE PIGEON-HOUSE.--The front of the pigeon-house\r\n    should have a southwest aspect, and, if a room be selected for\r\n    the purpose, it is usual to break a hole in the roof of the\r\n    building for the passage of the pigeons, but which can be closed\r\n    at convenience. A platform ought to be laid at the entrance for\r\n    the pigeons to perch upon, with some kind of defence against\r\n    strange cats, which will frequently depopulate a whole dovecot.\r\n    Yet, although cats are dangerous neighbours for the birds, they\r\n    are necessary to defend them from the approach of rats and mice,\r\n    which will not only suck the eggs, but destroy the birds. The\r\n    platform should be painted white, and renewed as the paint wears\r\n    off, white being a favourite colour with pigeons, and also most\r\n    conspicuous as a mark to enable them to find their house. The\r\n    boxes ought also to be similarly painted, and renewed when\r\n    necessary, for which purpose lime and water will do very well.\r\n\r\n    THE NECESSITY OF CLEANLINESS.--As cleanliness in human\r\n    habitations is of the first importance, so is it in the\r\n    pigeon-house. There the want of it will soon render the place a\r\n    nuisance not to be approached, and the birds, both young and\r\n    old, will be so covered with vermin and filth, that they will\r\n    neither enjoy health nor comforts, whilst early mortality\r\n    amongst them will be almost certain. In some cases, the\r\n    pigeon-house is cleaned daily; but it should always be done, at\r\n    any rate, once a week, and the floor covered with sifted gravel,\r\n    frequently renewed. Pigeons being exceedingly fond of water, and\r\n    having a prescience of the coming of rain, they may be seen upon\r\n    the house-tops waiting upon it until late in the evening, and\r\n    then spreading their wings to receive the luxury of the\r\n    refreshing shower. When they are confined in a room, therefore,\r\n    they should be allowed a wide pan of water, to be often renewed.\r\n    This serves them for a bath, which cools, refreshes, and assists\r\n    them to keep their bodies clear of vermin.\r\n\r\n    BREEDING PIGEONS.--In breeding pigeons, it is necessary to match\r\n    a cock and hen, and shut them up together, or place them near to\r\n    each other, and in the course of a day or two there is little\r\n    doubt of their mating. Various rules have been laid down for the\r\n    purpose of assisting to distinguish the cock from the hen\r\n    pigeon; but the masculine forwardness and action of the cock is\r\n    generally so remarkable, that he is easily ascertained. The\r\n    pigeon being monogamous, the male attaches and confines himself\r\n    to one female, and the attachment is reciprocal, and the\r\n    fidelity of the dove to its mate is proverbial. At the age of\r\n    six months, young pigeons are termed squeakers, and then begin\r\n    to breed, when properly managed. Their courtship, and the\r\n    well-known tone of voice in the cock, just then acquired and\r\n    commencing, are indications of their approaching union.\r\n    Nestlings, while fed by cock and hen, are termed squabs, and\r\n    are, at that age, sold and used for the table. The dove-house\r\n    pigeon is said to breed monthly, when well supplied with food.\r\n    At all events, it may be depended on, that pigeons of almost any\r\n    healthy and well-established variety will breed eight or nine\r\n    times in the year; whence it may readily be conceived how vast\r\n    are the numbers that may be raised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARRIER PIGEONS.]\r\n\r\n    THE CARRIER PIGEON.--Without doubt the carrier is entitled to\r\n    rank first in the pigeon family, with the exception, perhaps, of\r\n    the blue-rock pigeons. No domestic fowl can be traced to so\r\n    remote an antiquity. When Greece was in its glory, carrier\r\n    pigeons were used to convey to distant parts the names of the\r\n    victors at the Olympian games. During the holy war, when Acre\r\n    was besieged by King Richard, Saladin habitually corresponded\r\n    with the besieged by means of carrier pigeons. A shaft from an\r\n    English crossbow, however, happened to bring one of those\r\n    feathered messengers to the ground, and the stratagem was\r\n    discovered, the design of the Saracens revealed, and so turned\r\n    against the designers, that Acre was in the hands of the\r\n    Christians before the wily Saladin dreamt of such a thing.\r\n\r\nPIGEON PIE (Epsom Grand-Stand Recipe).\r\n\r\n975. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of rump-steak, 2 or 3 pigeons, 3 slices of\r\nham, pepper and salt to taste, 2 oz. of butter, 4 eggs, puff crust.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the steak into pieces about 3 inches square, and with it\r\nline the bottom of a pie-dish, seasoning it well with pepper and salt.\r\nClean the pigeons, rub them with pepper and salt inside and out, and put\r\ninto the body of each rather more than 1/2 oz. of butter; lay them on\r\nthe steak, and a piece of ham on each pigeon. Add the yolks of 4 eggs,\r\nand half fill the dish with stock; place a border of puff paste round\r\nthe edge of the dish, put on the cover, and ornament it in any way that\r\nmay be preferred. Clean three of the feet, and place them in a hole made\r\nin the crust at the top: this shows what kind of pie it is. Glaze the\r\ncrust,--that is to say, brush it over with the yolk of an egg,--and bake\r\nit in a well-heated oven for about 1-1/4 hour. When liked, a seasoning\r\nof pounded mace may be added.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/4 hour, or rather less. _Average cost_, 5s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TUMBLER PIGEONS.]\r\n\r\n    TUMBLER PIGEONS.--The smaller the size of this variety, the\r\n    greater its value. The head should be round and smooth, the neck\r\n    thin, and the tail similar to that of the turbit. Highly-bred\r\n    birds of this variety will attain an elevation in their flight\r\n    beyond that of any other pigeons; and it is in seeing these\r\n    little birds wing themselves so far into the skies that the\r\n    fanciers take such delight. For four or five hours tumblers have\r\n    been known to keep on the wing; and it is when they are almost\r\n    lost to the power of human vision that they exhibit those\r\n    pantomimic feats which give them their name, and which are\r\n    marked by a tumbling over-and-over process, which suggests the\r\n    idea of their having suddenly become giddy, been deprived of\r\n    their self-control, or overtaken by some calamity. This\r\n    acrobatic propensity in these pigeons has been ascribed by some\r\n    to the absence of a proper power in the tail; but is nothing\r\n    more than a natural habit, for which no adequate reason can be\r\n    assigned. Of this variety, the Almond Tumbler is the most\r\n    beautiful; and the greater the variation of the colour in the\r\n    flight and tail, the greater their value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUNT PIGEONS.]\r\n\r\n    THE RUNT PIGEON.--This is generally esteemed among the largest\r\n    of the pigeon varieties, and being possessed of proportionate\r\n    strength, with a strong propensity to exercise it, they keep the\r\n    dovecot in a state of almost continual commotion by domineering\r\n    over the weaker inmates. They breed tolerably well, however, and\r\n    are valuable for the table. There is both the Leghorn and the\r\n    Spanish Runt, variously plumaged; but when red, white, or black\r\n    mottled, are most highly esteemed. One of the great advantages\r\n    connected with the Runt is, that he is not likely to fly away\r\n    from home. Being heavy birds, they find it difficult, when well\r\n    fed, to mount even to a low housetop. Again, they require no\r\n    loft, or special dwelling-place, but, if properly tended, will\r\n    be perfectly satisfied, and thrive as well, in a rabbit-hutch as\r\n    any where. Their flavour is very good; and it is not an uncommon\r\n    thing for a squeaker Runt to exceed a pound and a quarter in\r\n    weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NUN PIGEONS.]\r\n\r\n    THE NUN PIGEON.--The Tumbler bears a strong resemblance to this\r\n    variety, which is characterized by a tuft of feathers rising\r\n    from the back of the head, and which, on the whole, is an\r\n    extremely pretty little bird. According to the colour of the\r\n    head, it is called the red, black, or yellow-headed Nun. To be a\r\n    perfect bird, it should have a small head and beak; and the\r\n    larger the tuft at the back of his head, the handsomer the bird\r\n    is esteemed, and proportionately valuable in the eyes of\r\n    pigeon-fanciers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRUMPETER PIGEONS.]\r\n\r\n    THE TRUMPETER PIGEON.--From the circumstance of this bird\r\n    imitating the sound of a trumpet, instead of cooing, like other\r\n    pigeons, it has received its designation. It is of the middle\r\n    size, having its legs and feet covered with feathers, and its\r\n    plumage generally of a mottled black-and-white. It has a tuft\r\n    springing from the root of its beak, and the larger this topknot\r\n    is, the higher the estimation in which the breed is held. In\r\n    their powers of trumpeting some are more expert than others; and\r\n    whether this has any effect in influencing their own estimate of\r\n    themselves, we cannot say; but they are rather select in the\r\n    choice of their company. If two of them are put in a\r\n    pigeon-house with other doves, it will be found that they\r\n    confine their association almost entirely to each other. As much\r\n    as two guineas have been paid for a well-trained docile bird of\r\n    this kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOOD-PIGEON.]\r\n\r\n    THE WOOD, OR WILD PIGEON.--Buffon enumerates upwards of thirty\r\n    varieties of the pigeon, which he derives from one root,--viz.\r\n    the stockdove, or common wild pigeon. All the varieties of\r\n    colour and form which we witness, he attributes to human\r\n    contrivance and fancy. Nevertheless, there exist essentially\r\n    specific differences in these birds, which would appear to be\r\n    attributable rather to the nature of the region, soil, and\r\n    climate to which they are indigenous, than to the art and\r\n    ingenuity of man. The stockdove, in its wild state, is still\r\n    found in some parts of Britain, forming its nest in the holes of\r\n    rocks, old towers, and in the hollows of trees; it never,\r\n    however, like the ringdove, nestles in the branches. Multitudes\r\n    of wild pigeons still visit our shores in the winter, coming\r\n    from their more northerly retreats, making their appearance\r\n    about November, and retiring again in the spring. When forests\r\n    of beechwood covered large tracts of the ground of this country,\r\n    these birds used to haunt them in myriads, frequently covering a\r\n    mile of ground in extent when they went out in the morning to\r\n    feed.\r\n\r\nSTEWED PIGEONS.\r\n\r\n976. INGREDIENTS.--6 pigeons, a few slices of bacon, 3 oz. of butter, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of minced parsley, sufficient stock No. 104 to cover the\r\npigeons, thickening of butter and flour, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom\r\nketchup, 1 tablespoonful of port wine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Empty and clean the pigeons thoroughly, mince the livers, add\r\nto these the parsley and butter, and put it into the insides of the\r\nbirds. Truss them with the legs inward, and put them into a stewpan,\r\nwith a few slices of bacon placed under and over them; add the stock,\r\nand stew gently for rather more than 1/2 hour. Dish the pigeons, strain\r\nthe gravy, thicken it with butter and flour, add the ketchup and port\r\nwine, give one boil, pour over the pigeons, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 6d. to 9d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from April to September.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FANTAIL PIGEONS.]\r\n\r\n    THE FANTAIL PIGEON.--This curious variety is inferior in point\r\n    of size to most of the other varieties, and is characterized by\r\n    having a short, slender bill, pendent wings, and naked legs and\r\n    feet. It has the power of erecting its tail in the manner of a\r\n    turkey-cock; during which action, especially when paying court\r\n    to it's mate, it trembles or shakes, like the peacock when\r\n    moving about with his train expanded and in full display. This\r\n    power of erecting and spreading the tail is not confined to the\r\n    male bird alone: the female possesses the same power to an equal\r\n    extent, and otherwise resembles the male in every respect. It is\r\n    not very prolific, and seldom succeeds so well in the aviary or\r\n    pigeon-house as most of the other kinds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JACOBIN PIGEONS.]\r\n\r\n    THE JACOBIN PIGEON.--This variety, having the power to transmit\r\n    to posterity a form precisely similar, with all its peculiar\r\n    characters undiminished, is, among pigeon-fanciers, designated\r\n    as of a pure or permanent race. It is distinguished by a\r\n    remarkable ruff or frill of raised feathers, which, commencing\r\n    behind the head and proceeding down the neck and breast, forms a\r\n    kind of hood, not unlike that worn by a monk. From this\r\n    circumstance, it has obtained its Gallic name of _nonnain\r\n    capuchin_. In size it is one of the smallest of the domestic\r\n    pigeons, and its form is light and elegant. It is a very\r\n    productive species, and, having its flight considerably impeded\r\n    by the size and form of its hooded frill, keeps much at home,\r\n    and is well adapted for the aviary or other buildings where\r\n    pigeons are confined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURBIT PIGEONS.]\r\n\r\n    THE TURBIT PIGEON.--This variety bears a strong resemblance to\r\n    the Jacobin, having a kind of frill in the fore part of its\r\n    neck, occasioned by the breast-feathers lying contrariwise and\r\n    standing straight out. The species is classed in accordance with\r\n    the colour of the shoulders, similarly as the Nuns are by the\r\n    colour of their heads. Their characteristics of excellence are a\r\n    full frill, short bill, and small round head. In Germany it is\r\n    called the ruffle pigeon, in allusion to the feathers on its\r\n    breast; and it has rarely any feathers on its feet. There is a\r\n    peculiarity connected with this bird, which somewhat lowers it\r\n    in the estimation of fanciers: it seldom rears more than one at\r\n    a time, which, therefore, marks it as a bird rather for\r\n    amusement than profit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARB PIGEONS.]\r\n\r\n    THE BARB PIGEON.--The name of this variety is a contraction of\r\n    Barbary, from which country it originally comes. It is both\r\n    prolific and has excellent qualities as a nurse. The kind most\r\n    esteemed is that of one uniform colour, that of blue-black being\r\n    preferable to any other. Speckled or mottled Barbs are esteemed\r\n    the most common of all pigeons. It is not unlike the Carrier\r\n    pigeon, and, at a small distance, might easily be mistaken for\r\n    the latter. It has a short beak and a small wattle. A spongy,\r\n    pinky skin round the eyes is its chief characteristic, however,\r\n    and this increases in size till the bird is three or four years\r\n    old. This peculiarity is hardly distinguishable in very young\r\n    birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLUE ROCK-PIGEON.]\r\n\r\n    THE ROCK PIGEON.--This variety, in its wild state, is found upon\r\n    the rocky parts of the west of Scotland, and the bold shores of\r\n    the Western Isles, more abundant than in any other parts of the\r\n    British islands. As the shores of the mainland are exposed to\r\n    the muds of the Atlantic, and the comparatively small islands\r\n    are surrounded by that ocean, the low grounds exposed to the\r\n    west are seldom covered with snow for any length of time, and\r\n    thus the birds easily find a supply of food. The numbers which\r\n    there congregate are often very great, and the din of their\r\n    united cry is sometimes very loud and even alarming. The love of\r\n    home and the certainty of returning to it is very conspicuous in\r\n    the rock-pigeon or _biset_, as it is called by the French.\r\n    Flocks from different parts of the coasts often meet on the\r\n    feeding-grounds; but when the time of returning to rest comes\r\n    round, each one keeps to its own party.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: OWL PIGEONS.]\r\n\r\n    THE OWL PIGEON.--This pigeon does not seem to be so well known\r\n    as it formerly was, if we may judge from the fact that few\r\n    modern writers mention it. Like the Turbit pigeon, the Owl has a\r\n    remarkable tuft of feathers on the breast, it having been\r\n    compared by some to the frill of a shirt, and by others to a\r\n    full-blown white rose. In size, it is not quite so large a\r\n    pigeon as the Jacobin. It is said to be preferred in France,\r\n    above other varieties, as a bird to rear and kill for the table.\r\n    In England it is very far from being common; indeed, we have\r\n    applied to several keepers of pigeons, who have fancied\r\n    themselves acquainted with all the varieties of this bird, and\r\n    they have been able to tell us nothing of it. Mr. Harrison Weir,\r\n    our artist, however, has made his portrait from the life.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED RABBIT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILED RABBIT.]\r\n\r\n977. INGREDIENTS.--Rabbit; water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--For boiling, choose rabbits with smooth and sharp claws, as\r\nthat denotes they are young: should these be blunt and rugged, the ears\r\ndry and tough, the animal is old. After emptying and skinning it, wash\r\nit well in cold water, and let it soak for about 1/4 hour in warm water,\r\nto draw out the blood. Bring the head round to the side, and fasten it\r\nthere by means of a skewer run through that and the body. Put the rabbit\r\ninto sufficient hot water to cover it, let it boil very gently until\r\ntender, which will be in from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, according to its size and\r\nage. Dish it, and smother it either with onion, mushroom, or liver\r\nsauce, or parsley-and-butter; the former is, however, generally\r\npreferred to any of the last-named sauces. When liver-sauce is\r\npreferred, the liver should be boiled for a few minutes, and minced very\r\nfinely, or rubbed through a sieve before it is added to the sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A very young rabbit, 1/2 hour; a large one, 3/4 hour; an old\r\none, 1 hour or longer.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 1s. to 1s. 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to February.\r\n\r\n    THE RABBIT.--Though this animal is an inhabitant of most\r\n    temperate climates, it does not reach so far north as the hare.\r\n    The wild rabbit is a native of Great Britain, and is found in\r\n    large numbers in the sandy districts of Norfolk and\r\n    Cambridgeshire. Its flesh is, by some, considered to have a\r\n    higher flavour than that of the tame rabbit, although it is\r\n    neither so white nor so delicate. The animal, however, becomes\r\n    larger and fatter in the tame than in the wild state; but it is\r\n    not desirable to have it so fat as it can be made.\r\n\r\nCURRIED RABBIT.\r\n\r\n978. INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, 2 oz. of butter, 3 onions, 1 pint of stock\r\nNo. 104, 1 tablespoonful of curry powder, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1\r\nteaspoonful of mushroom powder, the juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/2 lb. of rice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Empty, skin, and wash the rabbit thoroughly, and cut it neatly\r\ninto joints. Put it into a stewpan with the butter and sliced onions,\r\nand let them acquire a nice brown colour, but do not allow them to\r\nblacken. Pour in the stock, which should be boiling; mix the curry\r\npowder and flour smoothly with a little water, add it to the stock, with\r\nthe mushroom powder, and simmer gently for rather more than 1/2 hour;\r\nsqueeze in the lemon-juice, and serve in the centre of a dish, with an\r\nedging of boiled rice all round. Where economy is studied, water may be\r\nsubstituted for the stock; in this case, the meat and onions must be\r\nvery nicely browned. A little sour apple and rasped cocoa-nut stewed\r\nwith the curry will be found a great improvement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 1s. to 1s. 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD RABBITS.]\r\n\r\n    THE COMMON OR WILD RABBIT.--Warrens, or inclosures, are\r\n    frequently made in favourable localities, and some of them are\r\n    so large as to comprise 2,000 acres. The common wild rabbit is\r\n    of a grey colour, and is esteemed the best for the purposes of\r\n    food. Its skin is valuable as an article of commerce, being used\r\n    for the making of hats. Another variety of the rabbit, however,\r\n    called the \"silver-grey,\" has been lately introduced to this\r\n    country, and is still more valuable. Its colour is a black\r\n    ground, thickly interspersed with grey hairs; and its powers as\r\n    a destroyer and consumer of vegetable food are well known to be\r\n    enormous, especially by those who have gardens in the vicinity\r\n    of a rabbit-warren.\r\n\r\nFRIED RABBIT.\r\n\r\n979. INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, flour, dripping, 1 oz. of butter, 1\r\nteaspoonful of minced shalot, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the rabbit into neat joints, and flour them well; make the\r\ndripping boiling in a fryingpan, put in the rabbit, and fry it a nice\r\nbrown. Have ready a very hot dish, put in the butter, shalot, and\r\nketchup; arrange the rabbit pyramidically on this, and serve as quickly\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes. _Average cost_, from 1s. to 1s. 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to February.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The rabbit may be brushed over with egg, and sprinkled with\r\nbread crumbs, and fried as above. When cooked in this manner, make a\r\ngravy in the pan by recipe No. 866, and pour it round, but not over, the\r\npieces of rabbit.\r\n\r\n    VARIETIES IN RABBITS.--Almost everybody knows that a rabbit is a\r\n    furry animal, that lives on plants, and burrows in the ground;\r\n    that it has its varieties as well as other animals, and that it\r\n    is frequently an especial favourite with boys. Among its\r\n    varieties, the short-legged, with width and substance of loin,\r\n    is the most hardy, and fattens the most expeditiously. It has,\r\n    besides, the soundest liver, rabbits generally being subject to\r\n    defects of that part. It is also the smallest variety. There is\r\n    a very large species of the hare-colour, having much bone,\r\n    length and depth of carcase, large and long ears, with full\r\n    eyes, resembling those of the hare: it might readily be taken\r\n    for a hybrid or mule, but for the objection to its breeding. Its\r\n    flesh is high-coloured, substantial, and more savoury than that\r\n    of the common rabbit; and, cooked like the hare, it makes a good\r\n    dish. The large white, and yellow and white species, have whiter\r\n    and more delicate flesh, and, cooked in the same way, will rival\r\n    the turkey. Rabbits are divided into four kinds, distinguished\r\n    as warreners, parkers, hedgehogs, and sweethearts. The warrener,\r\n    as his name implies, is a member of a subterranean community,\r\n    and is less effeminate than his kindred who dwell _upon_ the\r\n    earth and have \"the world at their will,\" and his fur is the\r\n    most esteemed. After him, comes the parker, whose favourite\r\n    resort is a gentleman's pleasure-ground, where he usually breeds\r\n    in great numbers, and from which he frequently drives away the\r\n    hares. The hedgehog is a sort of vagabond rabbit, that, tinker\r\n    like, roams about the country, and would have a much better coat\r\n    on his back if he was more settled in his habits, and remained\r\n    more at home. The sweetheart is a tame rabbit, with its fur so\r\n    sleek, soft, and silky, that it is also used to some extent in\r\n    the important branch of hat-making.\r\n\r\nRABBIT A LA MINUTE.\r\n\r\n980. INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, 1/4 lb. of butter, salt and pepper to\r\ntaste, 2 blades of pounded mace, 3 dried mushrooms, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\nminced parsley, 2 teaspoonfuls of flour, 2 glasses of sherry, 1 pint of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Empty, skin, and wash the rabbit thoroughly, and cut it into\r\njoints. Put the butter into a stewpan with the pieces of rabbit; add\r\nsalt, pepper, and pounded mace, and let it cook until three parts done;\r\nthen put in the remaining ingredients, and boil for about 10 minutes: it\r\nwill then be ready to serve. Fowls or hare may be dressed in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 35 minutes. _Average cost_, from 1s. to 1s. 6d.\r\neach.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to February.\r\n\r\n\r\nRABBIT PIE.\r\n\r\n981. INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, a few slices of ham, salt and white pepper\r\nto taste, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, a\r\nfew forcemeat balls, 3 hard-boiled eggs, 1/2 pint of gravy, puff crust.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the rabbit (which should be young), remove the\r\nbreastbone, and bone the legs. Put the rabbit, slices of ham, forcemeat\r\nballs, and hard eggs, by turns, in layers, and season each layer with\r\npepper, salt, pounded mace, and grated nutmeg. Pour in about 1/2 pint of\r\nwater, cover with crust, and bake in a well-heated oven for about 1-1/2\r\nhour. Should the crust acquire too much colour, place a piece of paper\r\nover it to prevent its burning. When done, pour in at the top, by means\r\nof the hole in the middle of the crust, a little good gravy, which may\r\nbe made of the breast- and leg-bones of the rabbit and 2 or 3\r\nshank-bones, flavoured with onion, herbs, and spices.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, from 1s. to 1s. 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to February.\r\n\r\nNote.--The liver of the rabbit may be boiled, minced, and mixed with the\r\nforcemeat balls, when the flavour is liked.\r\n\r\n    FECUNDITY OF THE RABBIT.--The fruitfulness of this animal has\r\n    been the subject of wonder to all naturalists. It breeds seven\r\n    times in the year, and generally begets seven or eight young\r\n    ones at a time. If we suppose this to happen regularly for a\r\n    period of four years, the progeny that would spring from a\r\n    single pair would amount to more than a million. As the rabbit,\r\n    however, has many enemies, it can never be permitted to increase\r\n    in numbers to such an extent as to prove injurious to mankind;\r\n    for it not only furnishes man with an article of food, but is,\r\n    by carnivorous animals of every description, mercilessly\r\n    sacrificed. Notwithstanding this, however, in the time of the\r\n    Roman power, they once infested the Balearic islands to such an\r\n    extent, that the inhabitants were obliged to implore the\r\n    assistance of a military force from Augustus to exterminate\r\n    them.\r\n\r\nRAGOUT OF RABBIT OR HARE.\r\n\r\n982. INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, 3 teaspoonfuls of flour, 3 sliced onions, 2\r\noz. of butter, a few thin slices of bacon, pepper and salt to taste, 2\r\nslices of lemon, 1 bay-leaf, 1 glass of port wine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice the onions, and put them into a stewpan with the flour\r\nand butter; place the pan near the fire, stir well as the butter melts,\r\ntill the onions become a rich brown colour, and add, by degrees, a\r\nlittle water or gravy till the mixture is of the consistency of cream.\r\nCut some thin slices of bacon; lay in these with the rabbit, cut into\r\nneat joints; add a seasoning of pepper and salt, the lemon and bay-leaf,\r\nand let the whole simmer until tender. Pour in the port wine, give one\r\nboil, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/2 hour to simmer the rabbit.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 1s. to 1s. 6d. each. _Sufficient_ for 4 or 5\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to February.\r\n\r\n    THE RABBIT-HOUSE.--Rabbit-keeping is generally practised by a\r\n    few individuals in almost every town, and by a few in almost\r\n    every part of the country. Forty years ago, there were in the\r\n    metropolis one or two considerable feeders, who, according to\r\n    report, kept from 1,600 to 2,000 breeding does. These large\r\n    establishments, however, have ceased to exist, and London\r\n    receives the supply of tame as well as wild rabbits chiefly from\r\n    the country. Where they are kept, however, the rabbit-house\r\n    should be placed upon a dry foundation, and be well ventilated.\r\n    Exposure to rain, whether externally or internally, is fatal to\r\n    rabbits, which, like sheep, are liable to the rot, springing\r\n    from the same causes. Thorough ventilation and good air are\r\n    indispensable where many rabbits are kept, or they will neither\r\n    prosper nor remain healthy for any length of time. A thorough\r\n    draught or passage for the air is, therefore, absolutely\r\n    necessary, and should be so contrived as to be checked in cold\r\n    or wet weather by the closing or shutting of opposite doors or\r\n    windows.\r\n\r\nROAST OR BAKED RABBIT.\r\n\r\n983. INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, forcemeat No. 417, buttered paper,\r\nsausage-meat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST RABBIT.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Empty, skin, and thoroughly wash the rabbit; wipe it dry, line\r\nthe inside with sausage-meat and forcemeat made by recipe No. 417, and\r\nto which has been added the minced liver. Sew the stuffing inside,\r\nskewer back the head between the shoulders, cut off the fore-joints of\r\nthe shoulders and legs, bring: them close to the body, and secure them\r\nby means of a skewer. Wrap the rabbit in buttered paper, and put it down\r\nto a bright clear fire; keep it well basted, and a few minutes before it\r\nis done remove the paper, flour and froth it, and let it acquire a nice\r\nbrown colour. Take out the skewers, and serve with brown gravy and\r\nred-currant jelly. To bake the rabbit, proceed in the same manner as\r\nabove; in a good oven, it will take about the same time as roasting.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A young rabbit, 35 minutes; a large one, about 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 1s. to 1s. 6d. each. _Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to February.\r\n\r\n    THE HUTCH.--Hutches are generally placed one above another to\r\n    the height required by the number of rabbits and the extent of\r\n    the room. Where a large stock is kept, to make the most of room,\r\n    the hutches may be placed in rows, with a sufficient interval\r\n    between for feeding and cleaning, instead of being, in the usual\r\n    way, joined to the wall. It is preferable to rest the hutches\r\n    upon stands, about a foot above the ground, for the convenience\r\n    of cleaning under them. Each of the hutches intended for\r\n    breeding should have two rooms,--a feeding and a bed-room. Those\r\n    are single for the use of the weaned rabbits, or for the bucks,\r\n    which are always kept separate. The floors should be planed\r\n    smooth, that wet may run off, and a common hoe, with a short\r\n    handle, and a short broom, are most convenient implements for\r\n    cleaning these houses.\r\n\r\nSTEWED RABBIT.\r\n\r\n984. INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, 2 large onions, 6 cloves, 1 small\r\nteaspoonful of chopped lemon-peel, a few forcemeat balls, thickening of\r\nbutter and flour, 1 large tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the rabbit into small joints; put them into a stewpan, add\r\nthe onions sliced, the cloves, and minced lemon-peel. Pour in sufficient\r\nwater to cover the meat, and, when the rabbit is nearly done, drop in a\r\nfew forcemeat balls, to which has been added the liver, finely chopped.\r\nThicken the gravy with flour and butter, put in the ketchup, give one\r\nboil, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. to 1s. 6d each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to February.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOP-EARED RABBIT.]\r\n\r\n    FANCY RABBITS.--The graceful fall of the ears is the first thing\r\n    that is looked to by the fancier; next, the dewlap, if the\r\n    animal is in its prime; then the colours and marked points, and,\r\n    lastly, the shape and general appearance. The ears of a fine\r\n    rabbit should extend not less than seven inches, measured from\r\n    tip to tip in a line across the skull; but even should they\r\n    exceed this length, they are admitted with reluctance into a\r\n    fancy stock, unless they have a uniform and graceful droop. The\r\n    dewlap, which is a fold of skin under the neck and throat, is\r\n    only seen in fancy rabbits, after they have attained their full\r\n    growth: it commences immediately under the jaw, and adds greatly\r\n    to the beauty of their appearance. It goes down the throat and\r\n    between the fore legs, and is so broad that it projects beyond\r\n    the chin.\r\n\r\n    The difference between the fancy and common rabbit in the back,\r\n    independent of the ears, is sufficient to strike the common\r\n    observer. Fancy rabbits fetch a very high price; so much as five\r\n    and ten guineas, and even more, is sometimes given for a\r\n    first-rate doe. If young ones are first procured from a good\r\n    family, the foundation of an excellent stock can be procured for\r\n    a much smaller sum. Sometimes the ears, instead of drooping\r\n    down, slope backwards: a rabbit with this characteristic is\r\n    scarcely admitted into a fancy lot, and is not considered worth\r\n    more than the common variety. The next position is when one ear\r\n    lops outwards, and the other stands erect: rabbits of this kind\r\n    possess but little value, however fine the shape and beautiful\r\n    the colour, although they sometimes breed as good specimens as\r\n    finer ones.\r\n\r\n    The forward or horn-lop is one degree nearer perfection than the\r\n    half-lop: the ears, in this case, slope forward and down over\r\n    the forehead. Rabbits with this peculiarity are often perfect in\r\n    other respects, with the exception of the droop of the ears, and\r\n    often become the parents of perfect young ones: does of this\r\n    kind often have the power of lifting an ear erect. In the\r\n    ear-lop, the ears spread out in an horizontal position, like the\r\n    wings of a bird in flight, or the arms of a man swimming. A\r\n    great many excellent does have this characteristic, and some of\r\n    the best-bred bucks in the fancy are entirely so. Sometimes a\r\n    rabbit drops one ear completely, but raises the other so neatly\r\n    horizontally as to constitute an ear-lop: this is superior to\r\n    all others, except the perfect fall, which is so rarely to be\r\n    met with, that those which are merely ear-lopped are considered\r\n    as valuable rabbits, if well bred and with other good qualities.\r\n\r\n    \"The real lop has ears that hang down by the side of the cheek,\r\n    slanting somewhat outward in their descent, with the open part\r\n    of the ear inward, and sometimes either backwards or forwards\r\n    instead of perpendicular: when the animals stand in an easy\r\n    position, the tips of the ears touch the ground. The hollows of\r\n    the ears, in a fancy rabbit of a first-rate kind, should be\r\n    turned so completely backwards that only the outer part of them\r\n    should remain in front: they should match exactly in their\r\n    descent, and should slant outwards as little as possible.\"\r\n\r\n    The same authority asserts that perfect lops are so rare, that a\r\n    breeder possessing twenty of the handsomest and most perfect\r\n    does would consider himself lucky if, in the course of a year,\r\n    he managed to raise twelve full-lopped rabbits out of them all.\r\n    As regards variety and purity of colour an experienced breeder\r\n    says:--\r\n\r\n    \"The fur of fancy rabbits may be blue, or rather lead-colour,\r\n    and white, or black and white, or tawny and white, that is,\r\n    tortoiseshell-coloured. But it is not of so much importance what\r\n    colours the coat of a rabbit displays, as it is that those\r\n    colours shall be arranged in a particular manner, forming\r\n    imaginary figures or fancied resemblances to certain objects.\r\n    Hence the peculiarities of their markings have been denoted by\r\n    distinctive designations. What is termed 'the blue butterfly\r\n    smut' was, for some time, considered the most valuable of fancy\r\n    rabbits. It is thus named on account of having bluish or\r\n    lead-coloured spots on either side of the nose, having some\r\n    resemblance to the spread wings of a butterfly, what may be\r\n    termed the groundwork of the rabbit's face being white. A black\r\n    and white rabbit may also have the face marked in a similar\r\n    manner, constituting a 'black butterfly smut.'\r\n\r\n    \"But A good fancy rabbit must likewise have other marks, without\r\n    which it cannot be considered a perfect model of its kind. There\r\n    should be a black or blue patch on its back, called the saddle;\r\n    the tail must be of the same colour with the back and snout;\r\n    while the legs should be all white; and there ought to be dark\r\n    stripes on both sides of the body in front, passing backwards to\r\n    meet the saddle, and uniting on the top of the shoulders at the\r\n    part called the withers in a horse. These stripes form what is\r\n    termed the 'chain' having somewhat the appearance of a chain or\r\n    collar hanging round the neck.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Among thorough-bred fancy rabbits, perhaps not one in a hundred\r\n    will have all these markings clearly and exactly displayed on\r\n    the coat; but the more nearly the figures on the coat of a\r\n    rabbit approach to the pattern described, the greater will be\r\n    its value, so far, at least, as relates to colour. The beauty\r\n    and consequent worth of a fancy rabbit, however, depends a good\r\n    deal on its shape, or what is styled its carriage. A rabbit is\r\n    said to have a good carriage when its back is finely arched,\r\n    rising full two inches above the top of its head, which must be\r\n    held so low as for the muzzle and the points of the ears to\r\n    reach almost to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nSTEWED RABBIT, Larded.\r\n\r\n985. INGREDIENTS.--1 rabbit, a few strips of bacon, rather more than 1\r\npint of good broth or stock, a bunch of savoury herbs, salt and pepper\r\nto taste, thickening of butter and flour, 1 glass of sherry.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Well wash the rabbit, cut it into quarters, lard them with\r\nBlips of bacon, and fry them; then put them into a stewpan with the\r\nbroth, herbs, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; simmer gently until\r\nthe rabbit is tender, then strain the gravy, thicken it with butter and\r\nflour, add the sherry, give one boil, pour it over the rabbit, and\r\nserve. Garnish with slices of cut lemon.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. to 1s. 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to February.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HARE-RABBIT.]\r\n\r\n    THE HARE-RABBIT.--There has been lately introduced to French\r\n    tables an animal called the \"Hare-rabbit,\" partaking of the\r\n    nature, characteristics, and qualifications of both the hare and\r\n    the rabbit. It is highly spoken of, both as regards flesh and\r\n    flavour; and it is said to be the only hybrid which is able to\r\n    perpetuate its race. We hope that some enterprising individual\r\n    will soon secure for English, tables what would seem to be a\r\n    really valuable addition to our other game and poultry dishes;\r\n    although it will be rather difficult to exactly assign its\r\n    proper position, as within or without the meaning of \"game,\" as\r\n    by law established. Only a few specimens have been seen in\r\n    England at present, but there is no reason to doubt that our\r\n    rabbit-fanciers will prove equal to the occasion, and cope\r\n    successfully with our neighbours across the Channel in\r\n    introducing a new animal serviceable in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANGORA RABBIT.]\r\n\r\n    THE ANGORA RABBIT.--This is one of the handsomest of all\r\n    rabbits. It takes its name from being an inhabitant of Angora, a\r\n    city and district of Asia Minor. Like the well-known Angora goat\r\n    and cat, both of which are valuable on account of the fineness\r\n    of their wool and fur, this rabbit is prized for its long,\r\n    waved, silky fur, which, as an article of commerce is highly\r\n    esteemed. We are not aware whether it is eaten by the\r\n    inhabitants, and but few specimens have been introduced into\r\n    England, where, doubtless, the beauty of its coat would\r\n    materially suffer from the more humid and less genial character\r\n    of the climate. To the rabbits of the ancient and mountainous\r\n    district of Angora the words of the wise man would seem most to\r\n    apply, \"The conies are but feeble folk, yet make they their\r\n    houses in the rocks.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIMALAYA RABBITS.]\r\n\r\n    THE HIMALAYA RABBIT.--Amidst the mighty Himalaya mountains,\r\n    whose peaks are the highest on the globe, the pretty rabbit here\r\n    portrayed is found; and his colour seems to be like the snow,\r\n    which, above the altitude of from 13,000 to 16,000 feet,\r\n    perpetually crowns the summits of these monarchs of the world.\r\n    It is, at present, a very rare animal in England, but will,\r\n    doubtless, be more extensively known in the course of a few\r\n    years. From the earth-tunnelling powers of this little animal,\r\n    Martial declares that mankind learned the art of fortification,\r\n    mining, and covered roads.\r\n\r\nBOILED TURKEY.\r\n\r\n986. INGREDIENTS.--Turkey; forcemeat No. 417.\r\n\r\n_Choosing and Trussing_.--Hen turkeys are preferable for boiling, on\r\naccount of their whiteness and tenderness, and one of moderate size\r\nshould be selected, as a large one is not suitable for this mode of\r\ncooking. They should not be dressed until they have been killed 3 or 4\r\ndays, as they will neither look white, nor will they be tender. Pluck\r\nthe bird, carefully draw, and singe it with a piece of white paper, wash\r\nit inside and out, and wipe it thoroughly dry with a cloth. Cut off the\r\nhead and neck, draw the strings or sinews of the thighs, and cut off the\r\nlegs at the first joint; draw the legs into the body, fill the breast\r\nwith forcemeat made by recipe No. 417; run a skewer through the wing and\r\nthe middle joint of the leg, quite into the leg and wing on the opposite\r\nside; break the breastbone, and make the bird look as round and as\r\ncompact as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILED TURKEY.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the turkey into sufficient _hot_ water to cover it; let it\r\ncome to a boil, then carefully remove all the scum: if this is attended\r\nto, there is no occasion to boil the bird in a floured cloth; but it\r\nshould be well covered with the water. Let it simmer very gently for\r\nabout 1-1/2 hour to 1-3/4 hour, according to the size, and serve with\r\neither white, celery, oyster, or mushroom sauce, or parsley-and-butter,\r\na little of which should be poured over the turkey. Boiled ham, bacon,\r\ntongue, or pickled pork, should always accompany this dish; and when\r\noyster sauce is served, the turkey should be stuffed with oyster\r\nforcemeat.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A small turkey, 1-1/2 hour; a large one, 1-3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 5s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. each, but more expensive at\r\nChristmas, on account of the great demand.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from December to February.\r\n\r\n    THE TURKEY.--The turkey, for which fine bird we are indebted to\r\n    America, is certainly one of the most glorious presents made by\r\n    the New World to the Old. Some, indeed, assert that this bird\r\n    was known to the ancients, and that it was served at the\r\n    wedding-feast of Charlemagne. This opinion, however, has been\r\n    controverted by first-rate authorities, who declare that the\r\n    French name of the bird, _dindon_, proves its origin; that the\r\n    form of the bird is altogether foreign, and that it is found in\r\n    America alone in a wild state. There is but little doubt, from\r\n    the information which has been gained at considerable trouble,\r\n    that it appeared, generally, in Europe about the end of the 17th\r\n    century; that it was first imported into France by Jesuits, who\r\n    had been sent out missionaries to the West; and that from France\r\n    it spread over Europe. To this day, in many localities in\r\n    France, a turkey is called a Jesuit. On the farms of N. America,\r\n    where turkeys are very common, they are raised either from eggs\r\n    which have been found, or from young ones caught in the woods:\r\n    they thus preserve almost entirely their original plumage. The\r\n    turkey only became gradually acclimated, both on the continent\r\n    and in England: in the middle of the 18th century, scarcely 10\r\n    out of 20 young turkeys lived; now, generally speaking, 15 out\r\n    of the same number arrive at maturity.\r\n\r\nCROQUETTES OF TURKEY (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n987. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold turkey; to every 1/2 lb. of meat\r\nallow 2 oz. of ham or bacon, 2 shalots, 1 oz. of butter, 1 tablespoonful\r\nof flour, the yolks of 2 eggs, egg and bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--The smaller pieces, that will not do for a fricassée or hash,\r\nanswer very well for this dish. Mince the meat finely with ham or bacon\r\nin the above proportion; make a gravy of the bones and trimmings, well\r\nseasoning it; mince the shalots, put them into a stewpan with the\r\nbutter, add the flour; mix well, then put in the mince, and about 1/2\r\npint of the gravy made from the bones. (The proportion of the butter\r\nmust be increased or diminished according to the quantity of mince.)\r\nWhen just boiled, add the yolks of 2 eggs; put the mixture out to cool,\r\nand then shape it in a wineglass. Cover the croquettes with egg and\r\nbread crumbs, and fry them a delicate brown. Put small pieces of\r\nparsley-stems for stalks, and serve with, rolled bacon cut very thin.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--8 minutes to fry the croquettes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from December to February.\r\n\r\n    THE WILD TURKEY.--In its wild state, the turkey is gregarious,\r\n    going together in extensive flocks, numbering as many as five\r\n    hundred. These frequent the great swamps of America, where they\r\n    roost; but, at sunrise, leave these situations to repair to the\r\n    dry woods, in search of berries and acorns. They perch on the\r\n    boughs of trees, and, by rising from branch to branch, attain\r\n    the height they desire. They usually mount to the highest tops,\r\n    apparently from an instinctive conception that the loftier they\r\n    are the further they are out of danger. They fly awkwardly, but\r\n    run with great swiftness, and, about the month of March become\r\n    so fat as not to be able to take a flight beyond three or four\r\n    hundred yards, and are then, also, easily run down by a\r\n    horseman. Now, however, it rarely happens that wild turkeys are\r\n    seen in the inhabited parts of America. It is only in the\r\n    distant and more unfrequented parts that they are found in great\r\n    numbers.\r\n\r\nFRICASSEED TURKEY (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n988. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast or boiled turkey; a strip\r\nof lemon-peel, a bunch of savoury herbs, 1 onion, pepper and salt to\r\ntaste, 1 pint of water, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, the yolk of an egg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut some nice slices from the remains of a cold turkey, and put\r\nthe bones and trimmings into a stewpan, with the lemon-peel, herbs,\r\nonion, pepper, salt, add the water; stew for an hour, strain the gravy,\r\nand lay in the pieces of turkey. When warm through, add the cream and\r\nthe yolk of an egg; stir it well round, and, when getting thick, take\r\nout the pieces, lay them on a hot dish, and pour the sauce over. Garnish\r\nthe fricassée with sippets of toasted bread. Celery or cucumbers, cut\r\ninto small pieces, may be put into the sauce; if the former, it must be\r\nboiled first.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour to make the gravy.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold turkey, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from December to February.\r\n\r\n    THE TURKEY.--This is one of the gallinaceous birds, the\r\n    principal genera of which are Pheasants, Turkeys, Peacocks,\r\n    Bustards, Pintatoes, and Grouse. They live mostly on the ground,\r\n    scraping the earth with their feet, and feeding on seeds and\r\n    grains, which, previous to digestion, are macerated in their\r\n    crops. They usually associate in families, consisting of one\r\n    male and several females. Turkeys are particularly fond of the\r\n    seeds of nettles, whilst the seeds of the foxglove will poison\r\n    them. The common turkey is a native of North America, and, in\r\n    the reign of Henry VIII., was introduced into England. According\r\n    to Tusser's \"Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry,\" it began\r\n    about the year 1585 to form a dish at our rural Christmas\r\n    feasts:--\r\n\r\n      \"Beefe, mutton, and pork, shred pies of the best,\r\n      Pig, veal, goose, and capon, and turkey well drest;\r\n      Cheese, apples, and nuts, jolly carols to hear,\r\n      As then in the country is counted good cheer.\"\r\n\r\n    The turkey is one of the most difficult birds to rear, and its\r\n    flesh is much esteemed.\r\n\r\n    THE DISPOSITION OF THE TURKEY.--Among themselves, turkeys are\r\n    extremely furious, whilst amongst other animals they are usually\r\n    both weak and cowardly. The domestic cock frequently makes them\r\n    keep at a distance, whilst they will rarely attack him but in a\r\n    united body, when the cock is rather crushed by their weight\r\n    than defeated by their prowess. The disposition of the female is\r\n    in general much more gentle than that of the male. When leading\r\n    forth her young to collect their food, though so large and\r\n    apparently so powerful a bird, she gives them very slight\r\n    protection from the attacks of any rapacious animal which may\r\n    appear against them. She rather warns them of their danger than\r\n    offers to defend them; yet she is extremely affectionate to her\r\n    young.\r\n\r\nHASHED TURKEY.\r\n\r\n989. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast turkey, 1 onion, pepper and\r\nsalt to taste, rather more than 1 pint of water, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, 1\r\nblade of mace, a bunch of savoury herbs, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom\r\nketchup, 1 tablespoonful of port wine, thickening of butter and flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the turkey into neat joints; the best pieces reserve for\r\nthe hash, the inferior joints and trimmings put into a stewpan with an\r\nonion cut in slices, pepper and salt, a carrot, turnip, mace, herbs, and\r\nwater in the above proportion; simmer these for an hour, then strain the\r\ngravy, thicken it with butter and flour, flavour with ketchup and port\r\nwine, and lay in the pieces of turkey to warm through; if there is any\r\nstuffing left, put that in also, as it so much improves the flavour of\r\nthe gravy. When it boils, serve, and garnish the dish with sippets of\r\ntoasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour to make the gravy.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from December to February.\r\n\r\n    HUNTING TURKEYS.--Formerly, in Canada, hunting turkeys was one\r\n    of the principal diversions of the natives of that country. When\r\n    they discovered the retreat of the birds, which was generally\r\n    near a field of nettles, or where grain of any kind was\r\n    plentiful, they would send a well-trained dog into the midst of\r\n    the flock. The turkeys no sooner perceived their enemy than they\r\n    would run off at full speed, and with such swiftness that they\r\n    would leave the dog far behind. He, however, would follow in\r\n    their wake, and as they could not, for a great length of time,\r\n    continue at their speed, they were at last forced to seek\r\n    shelter in the trees. There they would sit, spent with fatigue,\r\n    till the hunters would approach, and, with long poles, knock\r\n    them down one after the other.\r\n\r\nROAST TURKEY.\r\n\r\n990. INGREDIENTS.--Turkey; forcemeat No. 417.\r\n\r\n_Choosing and Trussing_.--Choose cock turkeys by their short spurs and\r\nblack legs, in which case they are young; if the spurs are long, and the\r\nlegs pale and rough, they are old. If the bird has been long killed, the\r\neyes will appear sunk and the feet very dry; but, if fresh, the contrary\r\nwill be the case. Middling-sized fleshy turkeys are by many persons\r\nconsidered superior to those of an immense growth, as they are,\r\ngenerally speaking, much more tender. They should never be dressed the\r\nsame day they are killed; but, in cold weather, should hang at least 8\r\ndays; if the weather is mild, 4 or 5 days will be found sufficient.\r\nCarefully pluck the bird, singe it with white paper, and wipe it\r\nthoroughly with a cloth; draw it, preserve the liver and gizzard, and be\r\nparticular not to break the gall-bag, as no washing will remove the\r\nbitter taste it imparts where it once touches. Wash it _inside_ well,\r\nand wipe it thoroughly dry with a cloth; the _outside_ merely requires\r\nnicely wiping, as we have just stated. Cut off the neck close to the\r\nback, but leave enough of the crop-skin to turn over; break the leg-bone\r\nclose below the knee, draw out the strings from the thighs, and flatten\r\nthe breastbone to make it look plump. Have ready a forcemeat made by\r\nrecipe No. 417; fill the breast with this, and, if a trussing-needle is\r\nused, sew the neck over to the back; if a needle is not at hand, a\r\nskewer will answer the purpose. Run a skewer through the pinion and\r\nthigh into the body to the pinion and thigh on the other side, and press\r\nthe legs as much as possible between the breast and the side bones, and\r\nput the liver under one pinion and the gizzard under the other. Pass a\r\nstring across the back of the bird, catch it over the points of the\r\nskewer, tie it in the centre of the back, and be particular that the\r\nturkey is very firmly trussed. This may be more easily accomplished with\r\na needle and twine than with skewers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST TURKEY.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Fasten a sheet of buttered paper on to the breast of the bird,\r\nput it down to a bright fire, at some little distance _at first_\r\n(afterwards draw it nearer), and keep it well basted the whole of the\r\ntime it is cooking. About 1/4 hour before serving, remove the paper,\r\ndredge the turkey lightly with flour, and put a piece of butter into the\r\nbasting-ladle; as the butter melts, baste the bird with it. When of a\r\nnice brown and well frothed, serve with a tureen of good brown gravy and\r\none of bread sauce. Fried sausages are a favourite addition to roast\r\nturkey; they make a pretty garnish, besides adding very much to the\r\nflavour. When these are not at hand, a few forcemeat balls should be\r\nplaced round the dish as a garnish. Turkey may also be stuffed with\r\nsausage-meat, and a chestnut forcemeat with the same sauce is, by many\r\npersons, much esteemed as an accompaniment to this favourite dish.--See\r\ncoloured plate, A1.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Small turkey, 1-1/2 hour; moderate-sized one, about 10 lbs., 2\r\nhours; large turkey, 2-1/2 hours, or longer.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 10s. to 12s., but expensive at Christmas, on\r\naccount of the great demand.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--A moderate-sized turkey for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from December to February.\r\n\r\n    ENGLISH TURKEYS.--These are reared in great numbers in Suffolk,\r\n    Norfolk, and several other counties, whence they were wont to be\r\n    driven to the London market in flocks of several hundreds; the\r\n    improvements in our modes of travelling now, however, enable\r\n    them to be brought by railway. Their drivers used to manage them\r\n    with great facility, by means of a bit of red rag tied to the\r\n    end of a long stick, which, from the antipathy these birds have\r\n    to that colour, effectually answered the purpose of a scourge.\r\n    There are three varieties of the turkey in this country,--the\r\n    black, the white, and the speckled, or copper-coloured. The\r\n    black approaches nearest to the original stock, and is esteemed\r\n    the best. Its flesh is white and tender, delicate, nourishing,\r\n    and of excellent flavour; it greatly deteriorates with age,\r\n    however, and is then good for little but stewing.\r\n\r\nROAST TURKEY POULTS.\r\n\r\n991. INGREDIENTS.--Turkey poult; butter.\r\n\r\n_Choosing and Trussing_.--Choose a plump bird, and truss it in the\r\nfollowing manner:--After it has been carefully plucked, drawn, and\r\nsinged, skin the neck, and fasten the head under the wing; turn the legs\r\nat the first joint, and bring the feet close to the thighs, as a\r\nwoodcock should be trussed, _and do not stuff it_.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put it down to a bright fire, keep it well basted, and at first\r\nplace a piece of paper on the breast to prevent its taking too much\r\ncolour. About 10 minutes before serving, dredge it lightly with flour,\r\nand baste well; when nicely frothed, send it to table immediately, with\r\na little gravy in the dish, and some in a tureen. If at hand, a few\r\nwater-cresses may be placed round the turkey as a garnish, or it may be\r\nlarded.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1 hour. _Average cost_, 7s. to 8s. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--In full season from June to October.\r\n\r\n    THE FUTURE OF THE TURKEY.--Human ingenuity subjects almost every\r\n    material to the purposes of ornament or use and the feathers of\r\n    turkeys have been found adapted for more ends than one. The\r\n    American Indians convert then into an elegant clothing, and, by\r\n    twisting the inner ribs into a strong double string, with hemp\r\n    or the inner bark of the mulberry tree, work it like matting.\r\n    This fabric has a very rich and glossy appearance and is as fine\r\n    as silk shag. The natives of Louisiana used to make fans of the\r\n    tail; and four of that appendage joined together was formerly\r\n    constructed into a parasol by the French.\r\n\r\nTO BONE A TURKEY OR FOWL WITHOUT OPENING IT.\r\n\r\n(_Miss Acton's Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n992. After the fowl has been drawn and singed, wipe it inside and out\r\nwith a clean cloth, but do not wash it. Take off the head, cut through\r\nthe skin all round the first joint of the legs, and pull them from the\r\nfowl, to draw out the large tendons. Raise the flesh first from the\r\nlower part of the backbone, and a little also from the end of the\r\nbreastbone, if necessary; work the knife gradually to the socket of the\r\nthigh; with the point of the knife detach the joint from it, take the\r\nend of the bone firmly in the fingers, and cut the flesh clean from it\r\ndown to the next joint, round which pass the point of the knife\r\ncarefully, and when the skin is loosened from it in every part, cut\r\nround the next bone, keeping; the edge of the knife close to it, until\r\nthe whole of the leg is done. Remove the bones of the other leg in the\r\nsame manner; then detach the flesh from the back--and breast-bone\r\nsufficiently to enable you to reach the upper joints of the wings;\r\nproceed with these as with the legs, but be especially careful not to\r\npierce the skin of the second joint: it is usual to leave the pinions\r\nunboned, in order to give more easily its natural form to the fowl when\r\nit is dressed. The merrythought and neck-bones may now easily be cut\r\naway, the back-and side-bones taken out without being divided, and the\r\nbreastbone separated carefully from the flesh (which, as the work\r\nprogresses, must be turned back from the bones upon the fowl, until it\r\nis completely inside out). After the one remaining bone is removed, draw\r\nthe wings and legs back to their proper form, and turn the fowl right\r\nside outwards.\r\n\r\n993. A turkey is boned exactly in the same manner; but as it requires a\r\nvery large proportion of forcemeat to fill it entirely, the logs and\r\nwings are sometimes drawn into the body, to diminish the expense of\r\nthis. If very securely trussed, and sewn, the bird may be either boiled,\r\nor stewed in rich gravy, as well as roasted, after being boned and\r\nforced; but it must be most gently cooled, or it may burst.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER MODE OF BONING A TURKEY OR FOWL. (_Miss Acton's Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n994. Cut through the skin down the centre of the back, and raise the\r\nflesh carefully on either side with the point of a sharp knife, until\r\nthe sockets of the wings and thighs are reached. Till a little practice\r\nhas been gained, it will perhaps be bettor to bone these joints before\r\nproceeding further; but after they are once detached from it, the whole\r\nof the body may easily be separated from the flesh and taken out entire:\r\nonly the neck-bones and merrythought will then remain to be removed. The\r\nbird thus prepared may either be restored to its original form, by\r\nfilling the legs and wings with forcemeat, and the body with the livers\r\nof two or three fowls, mixed with alternate layers of parboiled tongue\r\nfreed from the rind, fine sausage-meat, or veal forcemeat, or thin\r\nslices of the nicest bacon, or aught else of good flavour, which will\r\ngive a marbled appearance to the fowl when it is carved; and then be\r\nsewn up and trussed as usual; or the legs and wings may be drawn inside\r\nthe body, and the bird being first flattened on a table, may be covered\r\nwith sausage-meat, and the various other ingredients we have named, so\r\nplaced that it shall be of equal thickness in every part; then tightly\r\nrolled, bound firmly together with a fillet of broad tape, wrapped in a\r\nthin pudding-cloth, closely tied at both ends, and dressed as\r\nfollows:--Put it into a braising-pan, stewpan, or thick iron saucepan,\r\nbright in the inside, and fitted as nearly as may be to its size; add\r\nall the chicken-bones, a bunch of sweet herbs, two carrots, two\r\nbay-leaves, a large blade of mace, twenty-four white peppercorns, and\r\nany trimmings or bones of undressed veal which may be at hand; cover the\r\nwhole with good veal broth, add salt, if needed, and stew it very\r\nsoftly, from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half; let it cool in\r\nthe liquor in which it was stewed; and after it is lifted out, boil down\r\nthe gravy to a jelly and strain it; let it become cold, clear off the\r\nfat, and serve it cut into large dice or roughed, and laid round the\r\nfowl, which is to be served cold. If restored to its form, instead of\r\nbeing rolled, it must be stewed gently for an hour, and may then be sent\r\nto table hot, covered with mushroom, or any other good sauce that may be\r\npreferred; or it may be left until the following day, and served\r\ngarnished with the jelly, which should be firm, and very clear and\r\nwell-flavoured: the liquor in which a calf's foot has been boiled down,\r\nadded to the broth, will give it the necessary degree of consistence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BONE FOWLS FOR FRICASSEES, CURRIES, & PIES.\r\n\r\n995. First carve them entirely into joints, then remove the bones,\r\nbeginning with the legs and wings, at the head of the largest bone; hold\r\nthis with the fingers, and work the knife as directed in the recipe\r\nabove. The remainder of the birds is too easily done to require any\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DRESS WHEATEARS.\r\n\r\n996. INGREDIENTS.--Wheatears; fresh butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--After the birds are picked, gutted, and cleaned, truss them\r\nlike larks, put them down to a quick fire, and baste them well with\r\nfresh butter. When done, which will be in about 20 minutes, dish them on\r\nfried bread crumbs, and garnish the dish with slices of lemon.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to October.\r\n\r\n    THE WHEATEAR.--The wheatear is an annual visitor of England: it\r\n    arrives about the middle of March and leaves in September. The\r\n    females come about a fortnight before the males, and continue to\r\n    arrive till the middle of May. They are in season from July to\r\n    October, and are taken in large numbers on the South Downs, in\r\n    the neighbourhood of Eastbourne, Brighton, and other parts of\r\n    Sussex. They are taken by means of snares and nets, and numbers\r\n    of them are eaten on the spot by the inhabitants. The larger\r\n    ones are sent to London and potted, where they are by many as\r\n    much esteemed as the ortolans of the continent. Mr. Pennant\r\n    assigns as the reason of their abounding on the downs about\r\n    Eastbourne, the existence of a species of fly which forms their\r\n    favourite food, and which feeds on the wild thyme on the\r\n    adjacent hills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GUINEA-PIG.]\r\n\r\n    997. THE GUINEA-PIG.--This common hutch-companion of the rabbit,\r\n    although originally a native of Brazil, propagates freely in\r\n    England and other European countries. Were it not that they\r\n    suffer cruelly from cats, and numerous other enemies, and that\r\n    it is the habit of the males to devour their own offspring,\r\n    their numbers would soon become overwhelming. Rats, however, it\r\n    is said, carefully avoid them; and for this reason they are\r\n    frequently bred by rabbit-fanciers, by way of protection for\r\n    their young stock against those troublesome vermin. The lower\r\n    tier of a rabbit-hutch is esteemed excellent quarters by the\r\n    guinea-pig: here, as he runs loose, he will devour the waste\r\n    food of his more admired companion. Home naturalists assert that\r\n    the guinea-pig will breed at two months old, the litter varying\r\n    from four to twelve at a time. It is varied in colour,--white,\r\n    fawn, and black, and a mixture of the three colours, forming a\r\n    tortoiseshell, which is the more generally admired hue.\r\n    Occasionally, the white ones have red eyes, like those of the\r\n    ferret and the white rabbit. Their flesh, although eatable, is\r\n    decidedly unfit for food; they have been tasted, however, we\r\n    presume by some enthusiast eager to advance the cause of\r\n    science, or by some eccentric epicure in search of a new\r\n    pleasure for his palate. Unless it has been that they deter rats\r\n    from intruding within the rabbit-hutch, they are as useless as\r\n    they are harmless. The usual ornament of an animal's hind\r\n    quarters is denied them; and were it not for this fact, and also\r\n    for their difference in colour, the Shaksperean locution, \"a rat\r\n    without a tail,\" would designate them very properly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CYGNET.]\r\n\r\n    998. THE CYGNET.--The Cygnet, or the young Swan, was formerly\r\n    much esteemed; but it has \"fallen from its high estate,\" and is\r\n    now rarely seen upon the table. We are not sure that it is not\r\n    still fattened in Norwich for the corporation of that place.\r\n    Persons who have property on the river there, take the young\r\n    birds, and send them to some one who is employed by the\r\n    corporation, to be fed; and for this trouble he is paid, or was\r\n    wont to be paid, about half a guinea a bird. It is as the future\r\n    bird of elegance and grace that the young swan is mostly\r\n    admired; when it has become old enough to grace the waters, then\r\n    it is that all admire her, when she with\r\n                      \"Archèd neck,\r\n      Between her white wings mantling,\r\n        proudly rows\r\n      Her state with oary feet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPOULTRY CARVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST DUCK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST DUCK.]\r\n\r\n999. No dishes require so much knowledge and skill in their carving as\r\ndo game and poultry; for it is necessary to be well acquainted with the\r\nanatomy of the bird and animal in order to place the knife at exactly\r\nthe proper point. A tough fowl and an old goose are sad triers of a\r\ncarver's powers and temper, and, indeed, sometimes of the good humour of\r\nthose in the neighbourhood of the carver; for a sudden tilt of the dish\r\nmay eventuate in the placing a quantity of the gravy in the lap of the\r\nright or left-hand supporter of the host. We will endeavour to assist\r\nthose who are unacquainted with the \"gentle art of carving,\" and also\r\nthose who are but slightly acquainted with it, by simply describing the\r\nrules to follow, and referring to the distinctly-marked Illustrations of\r\neach dish, which will further help to bring light to the minds of the\r\nuninitiated. If the bird be a young duckling, it may be carved like a\r\nfowl, viz., by first taking off the leg and the wing on either side, as\r\ndescribed at No. 1000; but in cases where the duckling is very small, it\r\nwill be as well not to separate the leg from the wing, as they will not\r\nthen form too large a portion for a single serving. After the legs and\r\nwings are disposed of, the remainder of the duck will be also carved in\r\nthe same manner as a fowl; and not much difficulty will be experienced,\r\nas ducklings are tender, and the joints are easily broken by a little\r\ngentle forcing, or penetrated by the knife. In cases where the duck is a\r\nlarge bird, the better plan to pursue is then to carve it like a goose,\r\nthat is, by cutting pieces from the breast in the direction indicated by\r\nthe lines marked from 1 to 2, commencing to carve the slices close to\r\nthe wing, and then proceeding upwards from that to the breastbone. If\r\nmore should be wanted than can be obtained from both sides of the\r\nbreast, then the legs and wings must be attacked, in the same way as is\r\ndescribed in connection with carving a fowl. It may be here remarked,\r\nthat as the legs of a duck are placed far more backward than those of a\r\nfowl, their position causing the waddling motion of the bird, the\r\nthigh-bones will be found considerably nearer towards the backbone than\r\nin a chicken: this is the only difference worth mentioning. The carver\r\nshould ask each guest if a portion of stuffing would be agreeable; and\r\nin order to get at this, a cut should be made below the breast, as shown\r\nby the line from 3 to 4, at the part called the \"apron,\" and the spoon\r\ninserted. (As described in the recipe, it is an excellent plan, when a\r\ncouple of ducks are served, to have one with, and the other without\r\nstuffing.) As to the prime parts of a duck, it has been said that \"the\r\nwing of a flier and the leg of a swimmer\" are severally the best\r\nportions. Some persons are fond of the feet of the duck; and, in\r\ntrussing, these should never be taken off. The leg, wing, and neckbone\r\nare here shown; so that it will be easy to see the shape they should be\r\nwhen cut off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEG, WING, AND NECKBONE OF DUCK.]\r\n\r\nBOILED FOWL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILED FOWL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEG, WING, AND NECKBONE OF FOWL.]\r\n\r\n1000. This will not be found a very difficult member of the poultry\r\nfamily to carve, unless, as may happen, a very old farmyard occupant,\r\nuseless for egg-laying purposes, has, by some unlucky mischance, been\r\nintroduced info the kitchen as a \"fine young chicken.\" Skill, however,\r\nand the application of a small amount of strength, combined with a fine\r\nkeeping of the temper, will even get over that difficulty. Fixing the\r\nfork firmly in the breast, let the knife be sharply passed along the\r\nline shown from 1 to 2; then cut downwards from that line to fig. 3; and\r\nthe wing, it will be found, can be easily withdrawn. The shape of the\r\nwing should be like the accompanying engraving. Let the fork be placed\r\ninside the leg, which should be gently forced away from the body of the\r\nfowl; and the joint, being thus discovered, the carver can readily cut\r\nthrough it, and the leg can be served. When the leg is displaced, it\r\nshould be of the same shape as that shown in the annexed woodcut. The\r\nlegs and wings on either side having been taken off, the carver should\r\ndraw his knife through the flesh in the direction of the line 4 to 5: by\r\nthis means the knife can be slipped underneath the merrythought, which,\r\nbeing lifted up and pressed backward, will immediately come off. The\r\ncollar--or neck-bones are the next to consider: these lie on each side\r\nof the merrythought, close under the upper part of the wings; and, in\r\norder to free these from the fowl, they must also be raised by the knife\r\nat their broad end, and turned from the body towards the breastbone,\r\nuntil the shorter piece of the bone, as shown in the cut, breaks off.\r\nThere will now be left only the breast, with the ribs. The breast can\r\nbe, without difficulty, disengaged from the ribs by cutting through the\r\nlatter, which will offer little impediment. The side-bones are now to be\r\ntaken off; and to do this, the lower end of the back should be turned\r\nfrom the carver, who should press the point of the knife through the top\r\nof the backbone, near the centre, bringing it down towards the end of\r\nthe back completely through the bone. If the knife is now turned in the\r\nopposite direction, the joint will be easily separated from the\r\nvertebra. The backbone being now uppermost, the fork should be pressed\r\nfirmly down on it, whilst at the same time the knife should be employed\r\nin raising up the lower small end of the fowl towards the fork, and thus\r\nthe back will be dislocated about its middle. The wings, breast, and\r\nmerrythought are esteemed the prime parts of a fowl, and are usually\r\nserved to the ladies of the company, to whom legs, except as a matter of\r\nparamount necessity, should not be given. Byron gave it as one reason\r\nwhy he did not like dining with ladies, that they always had the wings\r\nof the fowls, which he himself preferred. We heard a gentleman who, when\r\nhe might have had a wing, declare his partiality for a leg, saying that\r\nhe had been obliged to eat legs for so long a time, that he had at last\r\ncome to like them better than the other more prized parts. If the fowl\r\nis, capon-like, very large, slices maybe carved from its breast in the\r\nsame manner as from a turkey's.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST FOWL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST FOWL.]\r\n\r\n1001. Generally speaking, it is not necessary so completely to cut up a\r\nfowl as we have described in the preceding paragraphs, unless, indeed, a\r\nlarge family party is assembled, and there are a number of \"little\r\nmouths\" to be filled, or some other such circumstances prevail. A roast\r\nfowl is carved in the same manner as a boiled fowl, No. 1000; viz., by\r\ncutting along the line from. 1 to 2, and then round the leg between it\r\nand the wing. The markings and detached pieces, as shown in the\r\nengravings under the heading of \"Boiled Fowl,\" supersede the necessity\r\nof our lengthily again describing the operation. It may be added, that\r\nthe liver, being considered a delicacy, should be divided, and one half\r\nserved with each wing. In the case of a fowl being shifted, it will be\r\nproper to give each guest a portion, unless it be not agreeable to some\r\none of the party.\r\n\r\nROAST GOOSE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST GOOSE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEG, WING, AND NECK-BONE OF GOOSE.]\r\n\r\n1002. It would not be fair to say that this dish bodes a great deal of\r\nhappiness to an inexperienced carver, especially if there is a large\r\nparty to serve, and the slices off the breast should not suffice to\r\nsatisfy the desires and cravings of many wholesome appetites, produced,\r\nmay be, by the various sports in vogue at Michaelmas and Christmas. The\r\nbeginning of the task, however, is not in any way difficult. Evenly-cut\r\nslices, not too thick or too thin, should be carved from the breast in\r\nthe direction of the line from 2 to 3; after the first slice has been\r\ncut, a hole should be made with the knife in the part called the apron,\r\npassing it round the line, as indicated by the figures 1, 1, 1: here the\r\nstuffing is located, and some of this should be served on each plate,\r\nunless it is discovered that it is not agreeable to the taste of some\r\none guest. If the carver manages cleverly, he will be able to cut a very\r\nlarge number of fine slices off the breast, and the more so if he\r\ncommences close down by the wing, and carves upwards towards the ridge\r\nof the breastbone. As many slices as can be taken from the breast being\r\ncarved, the wings should be cut off; and the same process as described\r\nin carving boiled fowl, is made use of in this instance, only more\r\ndexterity and greater force will most probably be required: the shape of\r\nthe leg, when disengaged from the body of the goose, should be like that\r\nshown in the accompanying engraving. It will be necessary, perhaps, in\r\ntaking off the leg, to turn the goose on its side, and then, pressing\r\ndown the small end of the leg, the knife should be passed under it from\r\nthe top quite down to the joint; the leg being now turned back by the\r\nfork, the knife must cut through the joint, loosening the thigh-bone\r\nfrom its socket. The merrythought, which in a goose is not so large as\r\nmight be expected, is disengaged in the same way as that of a fowl--by\r\npassing the knife under it, and pressing it backwards towards the neck.\r\nThe neck-bones, of which we give a cut, are freed by the same process as\r\nare those of a fowl; and the same may be said of all the other parts of\r\nthis bird. The breast of a goose is the part most esteemed; all parts,\r\nhowever, are good, and full of juicy flavour.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIGEON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIGEON.]\r\n\r\n1003. A very straightforward plan is adopted in carving a pigeon: the\r\nknife is carried sharply in the direction of the line as shown from 1 to\r\n2, entirely through the bird, cutting it into two precisely equal and\r\nsimilar parts. If it is necessary to make three pieces of it, a small\r\nwing should be cut off with the leg on either side, thus serving two\r\nguests; and, by this means, there will be sufficient meat left on the\r\nbreast to send to the third guest.\r\n\r\n\r\nRABBITS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILED RABBIT.]\r\n\r\n1004. In carving a boiled rabbit, let the knife be drawn on each side of\r\nthe backbone, the whole length of the rabbit, as shown by the dotted\r\nline 3 to 4: thus the rabbit will be in three parts. Now let the back be\r\ndivided into two equal parts in the direction of the line from 1 to 2;\r\nthen let the leg be taken off, as shown by the line 5 to 6, and the\r\nshoulder, as shown by the line 7 to 8. This, in our opinion, is the best\r\nplan to carve a rabbit, although there are other modes which are\r\npreferred by some.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST RABBIT.]\r\n\r\nA roast rabbit is rather differently trussed from one that is meant to\r\nbe boiled; but the carving is nearly similar, as will be seen by the\r\ncut. The back should be divided into as many pieces as it will give, and\r\nthe legs and shoulders can then be disengaged in the same manner as\r\nthose of the boiled animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST TURKEY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST TURKEY.]\r\n\r\n1005. A noble dish is a turkey, roast or boiled. A Christmas dinner,\r\nwith the middle classes of this empire, would scarcely be a Christmas\r\ndinner without its turkey; and we can hardly imagine an object of\r\ngreater envy than is presented by a respected portly pater-familias\r\ncarving, at the season devoted to good cheer and genial charity, his own\r\nfat turkey, and carving it well. The only art consists, as in the\r\ncarving of a goose, in getting from the breast as many fine slices as\r\npossible; and all must have remarked the very great difference in the\r\nlarge number of people whom a good carver will find slices for, and the\r\ncomparatively few that a bad carver will succeed in serving. As we have\r\nstated in both the carving of a duck and goose, the carver should\r\ncommence cutting slices close to the wing from, 2 to 3, and then proceed\r\nupwards towards the ridge of the breastbone: this is not the usual plan,\r\nbut, in practice, will be found the best. The breast is the only part\r\nwhich is looked on as fine in a turkey, the legs being very seldom cut\r\noff and eaten at table: they are usually removed to the kitchen, where\r\nthey are taken off, as here marked, to appear only in a form which seems\r\nto have a special attraction at a bachelor's supper-table,--we mean\r\ndevilled: served in this way, they are especially liked and relished.\r\n\r\nA boiled turkey is carved in the same manner as when roasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON GAME.\r\n\r\n1006. THE COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND has a maxim, that goods, in which no\r\nperson can claim any property, belong, by his or her prerogative, to the\r\nking or queen. Accordingly, those animals, those _ferae naturae_, which\r\ncome under the denomination of game, are, in our laws, styled his or her\r\nmajesty's, and may therefore, as a matter of course, be granted by the\r\nsovereign to another; in consequence of which another may prescribe to\r\npossess the same within a certain precinct or lordship. From this\r\ncircumstance arose the right of lords of manors or others to the game\r\nwithin their respective liberties; and to protect these species of\r\nanimals, the game laws were originated, and still remain in force. There\r\nare innumerable acts of parliament inflicting penalties on persons who\r\nmay illegally kill game, and some of them are very severe; but they\r\ncannot be said to answer their end, nor can it be expected that they\r\never will, whilst there are so many persons of great wealth who have not\r\notherwise the means of procuring game, except by purchase, and who will\r\nhave it. These must necessarily encourage poaching, which, to a very\r\nlarge extent, must continue to render all game laws nugatory as to their\r\nintended effects upon the rustic population.\r\n\r\n1007. THE OBJECT OF THESE LAWS, however, is not wholly confined to the\r\nrestraining of the illegal sportsman. Even qualified or privileged\r\npersons must not kill game at all seasons. During the day, the hours\r\nallowed for sporting are from one hour before sunrise till one hour\r\nafter sunset; whilst the time of killing certain species is also\r\nrestricted to certain seasons. For example, the season for\r\nbustard-shooting is from December 1 to March 1; for grouse, or red\r\ngrouse, from August 12 to December 10; heath-fowl, or black-game, from\r\nAugust 20 to December 20; partridges from September 1 to February 12;\r\npheasants from October 1 to February 1; widgeons, wild ducks, wild\r\ngeese, wild fowls, at any time but in June, July, August, and September.\r\nHares may be killed at any time of the year, under certain restrictions\r\ndefined by an act of parliament of the 10th of George III.\r\n\r\n1008. THE EXERCISE OR DIVERSION OF PURSUING FOUR-FOOTED BEASTS OF GAME\r\nis called hunting, which, to this day, is followed in the field and the\r\nforest, with gun and greyhound. Birds, on the contrary, are not hunted,\r\nbut shot in the air, or taken with nets and other devices, which is\r\ncalled fowling; or they are pursued and taken by birds of prey, which is\r\ncalled hawking, a species of sport now fallen almost entirely into\r\ndesuetude in England, although, in some parts, showing signs of being\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\n\r\n1009. IN PURSUING FOUR-FOOTED BEASTS, such as deer, boars, and hares,\r\nproperly termed hunting, mankind were, from the earliest ages, engaged.\r\nIt was the rudest and the most obvious manner of acquiring human support\r\nbefore the agricultural arts had in any degree advanced. It is an\r\nemployment, however, requiring both art and contrivance, as well as a\r\ncertain fearlessness of character, combined with the power of\r\nconsiderable physical endurance. Without these, success could not be\r\nvery great; but, at best, the occupation is usually accompanied with\r\nrude and turbulent habits; and, when combined with these, it constitutes\r\nwhat is termed the savage state of man. As culture advances, and as the\r\nsoil proportionably becomes devoted to the plough or to the sustenance\r\nof the tamer or more domesticated animals, the range of the huntsman is\r\nproportionably limited; so that when a country has attained to a high\r\nstate of cultivation, hunting becomes little else than an amusement of\r\nthe opulent. In the case of fur-bearing animals, however, it is somewhat\r\ndifferent; for these continue to supply the wants of civilization with\r\none of its most valuable materials of commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n1010. THE THEMES WHICH FORM THE MINSTRELSY OF THE EARLIEST AGES, either\r\nrelate to the spoils of the chase or the dangers of the battle-field.\r\nEven the sacred writings introduce us to Nimrod, the first mighty hunter\r\nbefore the Lord, and tell us that Ishmael, in the solitudes of Arabia,\r\nbecame a skilful bow-man; and that David, when yet young, was not afraid\r\nto join in combat with the lion or the bear. The Greek mythology teems\r\nwith hunting exploits. Hercules overthrows the Nemaean lion, the\r\nErymanthean boar, and the hydra of Lerna; Diana descends to the earth,\r\nand pursues the stag; whilst Aesculapius, Nestor, Theseus, Ulysses, and\r\nAchilles are all followers of the chase. Aristotle, sage as he was,\r\nadvises young men to apply themselves early to it; and Plato finds in it\r\nsomething divine. Horace exalts it as a preparative exercise for the\r\npath of glory, and several of the heroes of Homer are its ardent\r\nvotaries. The Romans followed the hunting customs of the Greeks, and the\r\nancient Britons were hunters before Julius Caesar invaded their shores.\r\n\r\n1011. ALTHOUGH THE ANCIENT BRITONS FOLLOWED HUNTING, however, they did\r\nnot confine themselves solely to its pursuit. They bred cattle and\r\ntilled the ground, and, to some extent, indicated the rudimentary state\r\nof a pastoral and agricultural life; but, in every social change, the\r\nsports of the field maintained their place. After the expulsion of the\r\nDanes, and during the brief restoration of the Saxon monarchy, these\r\nwere still followed: even Edward the Confessor, who would join in no\r\nother secular amusements, took the greatest delight, says William of\r\nMalmesbury, \"to follow a pack of swift hounds in pursuit of game, and to\r\ncheer them with his voice.\"\r\n\r\n1012. NOR WAS EDWARD the only English sovereign who delighted in the\r\npleasures of the chase. William the Norman, and his two sons who\r\nsucceeded him, were passionately fond of the sport, and greatly\r\ncircumscribed the liberties of their subjects in reference to the\r\nkilling of game. The privilege of hunting in the royal forests was\r\nconfined to the king and his favourites; and in order that these\r\numbrageous retreats might be made more extensive, whole villages were\r\ndepopulated, places of worship levelled with the ground, and every means\r\nadopted that might give a sufficient amplitude of space, in accordance\r\nwith the royal pleasure, for the beasts of the chase. King John was\r\nlikewise especially attached to the sports of the field; whilst Edward\r\nIII. was so enamoured of the exercise, that even during his absence at\r\nthe wars in France, he took with him sixty couples of stag-hounds and as\r\nmany hare-hounds, and every day amused himself either with hunting or\r\nhawking. Great in wisdom as the Scotch Solomon, James I., conceited\r\nhimself to be, he was much addicted to the amusements of hunting,\r\nhawking, and shooting. Yea, it is oven asserted that his precious time\r\nwas divided between hunting, the bottle, and his standish: to the first\r\nhe gave his fair weather, to the second his dull, and to the third his\r\ncloudy. From his days down to the present, the sports of the field have\r\ncontinued to hold their high reputation, not only for the promotion of\r\nhealth, but for helping to form that manliness of character which enters\r\nso largely into the composition of the sons of the British soil. That it\r\nlargely helps to do this there can be no doubt. The late duke of\r\nGrafton, when hunting, was, on one occasion, thrown into a ditch. A\r\nyoung curate, engaged in the same chase, cried out, \"Lie still, my\r\nlord!\" leapt over him, and pursued his sport. Such an apparent want of\r\nfeeling might be expected to have been resented by the duke; but not so.\r\nOn his being helped up by his attendant, he said, \"That man shall have\r\nthe first good living that falls to my disposal: had he stopped to have\r\ngiven me his sympathy, I never would have given him anything.\" Such was\r\nthe manly sentiment of the duke, who delighted in the exemplification of\r\na spirit similarly ardent as his own in the sport, and above the\r\nbaseness of an assumed sorrow.\r\n\r\n1013. THAT HUNTING HAS IN MANY INSTANCES BEEN CARRIED TO AN EXCESS is\r\nwell known, and the match given by the Prince Esterhazy, regent of\r\nHungary, on the signing of the treaty of peace with France, is not the\r\nleast extraordinary upon record. On that occasion, there were killed 160\r\ndeer, 100 wild boars, 300 hares, and 80 foxes: this was the achievement\r\nof one day. Enormous, however, as this slaughter may appear, it is\r\ngreatly inferior to that made by the contemporary king of Naples on a\r\nhunting expedition. That sovereign had a larger extent of ground at his\r\ncommand, and a longer period for the exercise of his talents;\r\nconsequently, his sport, if it can so be called, was proportionably\r\ngreater. It was pursued during his journey to Vienna, in Austria,\r\nBohemia, and Moravia; when he killed 5 bears, 1,820 boars, 1,950 deer,\r\n1,145 does, 1,625 roebucks, 11,121 rabbits, 13 wolves, 17 badgers,\r\n16,354 hares, and 354 foxes. In birds, during the same expedition, he\r\nkilled 15,350 pheasants and 12,335 partridges. Such an amount of\r\ndestruction can hardly be called sport; it resembles more the\r\nindiscriminate slaughter of a battle-field, where the scientific engines\r\nof civilized warfare are brought to bear upon defenceless savages.\r\n\r\n1014. DEER AND HARES may be esteemed as the only four-footed animals now\r\nhunted in Britain for the table; and even those are not followed with\r\nthe same ardour as they were wont to be. Still, there is no country in\r\nthe world where the sport of hunting on horseback is carried to such an\r\nextent as in Great Britain, and where the pleasures of the chase are so\r\nwell understood, and conducted on such purely scientific principles. The\r\nFox, of all \"the beasts of the field,\" is now considered to afford the\r\nbest sport. For this, it is infinitely superior to the stag; for the\r\nreal sportsman can only enjoy that chase when the deer is sought for and\r\nfound like other game which are pursued with hounds. In the case of\r\nfinding an outlying fallow-deer, which is unharboured, in this manner,\r\ngreat sport is frequently obtained; but this is now rarely to be met\r\nwith in Britain. In reference to hare-hunting, it is much followed in\r\nmany parts of this and the sister island; but, by the true foxhunter, it\r\nis considered as a sport only fit to be pursued by women and old men.\r\nAlthough it is less dangerous and exciting than the fox-chase, however,\r\nit has great charms for those who do not care for the hard riding which\r\nthe other requires.\r\n\r\n\r\n1015. THE ART OF TAKING OR KILLING BIRDS is called \"fowling,\" and is\r\neither practised as an amusement by persons of rank or property, or for\r\na livelihood by persons who use nets and other apparatus. When practised\r\nas an amusement, it principally consists of killing them with a light\r\nfirearm called a \"fowling-piece,\" and the sport is secured to those who\r\npursue it by the game laws. The other means by which birds are taken,\r\nconsist in imitating their voices, or leading them, by other artifices,\r\ninto situations where they become entrapped by nets, birdlime, or\r\notherwise. For taking large numbers of birds, the pipe or call is the\r\nmost common means employed; and this is done during the months of\r\nSeptember and October. We will here briefly give a description of the\r\n_modus operandi_ pursued in this sport. A thin wood is usually the spot\r\nchosen, and, under a tree at a little distance from the others, a cabin\r\nis erected, and there are only such branches left on the tree as are\r\nnecessary for the placing of the birdlime, and which are covered with\r\nit. Around the cabin are placed avenues with twisted perches, also\r\ncovered with birdlime. Having thus prepared all that is necessary, the\r\nbirdcatcher places himself in the cabin, and, at sunrise and sunset,\r\nimitates the cry of a small bird calling the others to its assistance.\r\nSupposing that the cry of the owl is imitated, immediately different\r\nkinds of birds will flock together at the cry of their common enemy,\r\nwhen, at every instant, they will be seen falling to the ground, their\r\nwings being of no use to them, from their having come in contact with\r\nthe birdlime. The cries of those which are thus situated now attract\r\nothers, and thus are large numbers taken in a short space of time. If\r\nowls were themselves desired to be taken, it is only during the night\r\nthat this can be done, by counterfeiting the squeak of the mouse. Larks,\r\nother birds, and water-fowl, are sometimes taken by nets; but to\r\ndescribe fully the manner in which this is done, would here occupy too\r\nmuch space.\r\n\r\n1016. FEATHERED GAME HAVE FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL given gratification to\r\nthe palate of man. With the exception of birds of prey, and some other\r\nspecies, Moses permitted his people to eat them; and the Egyptians made\r\nofferings to their priests of their most delicate birds. The ancient\r\nGreeks commenced their repasts with little roasted birds; and feathered\r\ngame, amongst the Romans, was served as the second course. Indeed,\r\nseveral of the ancient _gourmands_ of the \"imperial city\" were so fond\r\nof game, that they brought themselves to ruin by eating flamingoes and\r\npheasants. \"Some modern nations, the French among others,\" says Monsieur\r\nSoyer, \"formerly ate the heron, crane, crow, stork, swan, cormorant, and\r\nbittern. The first three especially were highly esteemed; and\r\nLaillevant, cook of Charles VII., teaches us how to prepare these\r\nmeagre, tough birds. Belon says, that in spite of its revolting taste\r\nwhen unaccustomed to it, the bittern is, however, among the delicious\r\ntreats of the French. This writer also asserts, that a falcon or a\r\nvulture, either roasted or boiled, is excellent eating; and that if one\r\nof these birds happened to kill itself in flying after game, the\r\nfalconer instantly cooked it. Lebaut calls the heron a royal viand.\"\r\n\r\n1017. THE HERON WAS HUNTED BY THE HAWK, and the sport of hawking is\r\nusually placed at the head of those amusements that can only be\r\npractised in the country. This precedency it probably obtained from its\r\nbeing a pastime to generally followed by the nobility, not in Great\r\nBritain only, but likewise on the continent. In former times, persons of\r\nhigh rank rarely appeared in public without their dogs and their hawks:\r\nthe latter they carried with them when they journeyed from one country\r\nto another, and sometimes even took them to battle with them, and would\r\nnot part with them when taken prisoners, even to obtain their own\r\nliberty. Such birds were esteemed as the ensigns of nobility, and no\r\naction was reckoned more dishonourable in a man of rank than that of\r\ngiving up his hawk. We have already alluded to the hunting propensities\r\nof our own Edward III., and we may also allude to his being equally\r\naddicted to hawking. According to Froissart, when this sovereign invaded\r\nFrance, he took with him thirty falconers on horseback, who had charge\r\nof his hawks, and every day, as his royal fancy inclined him, he either\r\nhunted, or went to the river for the purpose of hawking. In the great\r\nand powerful, the pursuit of game as a sport is allowable, but in those\r\nwho have to earn their bread by the sweat of their brow, it is to be\r\ncondemned. In Burton's \"Anatomy of Melancholy\" we find a humorous story,\r\ntold by Poggius, the Florentine, who reprobates this folly in such\r\npersons. It is this. A physician of Milan, that cured madmen, had a pit\r\nof water in his house, in which he kept his patients, some up to the\r\nknees, some to the girdle, some to the chin, _pro modo insaniae_, as\r\nthey were more or less affected. One of them by chance, that was well\r\nrecovered, stood in the door, and seeing a gallant pass by with a hawk\r\non his fist, well mounted, with his spaniels after him, would needs know\r\nto what use all this preparation served. He made answer, To kill certain\r\nfowl. The patient demanded again, what his fowl might be worth which he\r\nkilled in a year? He replied, Five or ten crowns; and when he urged him\r\nfurther, what his dogs, horse, and hawks stood him in, he told him four\r\nhundred crowns. With that the patient bade him begone, as he loved his\r\nlife and welfare; \"for if our master come and find thee here, he will\r\nput thee in the pit, amongst the madmen, up to the chin.\" Thus reproving\r\nthe madness of such men as will spend themselves in those vain sports,\r\nto the neglect of their business and necessary affairs.\r\n\r\n1018. AS THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF SOCIAL PROGRESS is, at least to limit,\r\nif not entirely to suppress, such sports as we have here been treating\r\nof, much of the romance of country life has passed away. This is more\r\nespecially the case with falconry, which had its origin about the middle\r\nof the fourth century, although, lately, some attempts have been rather\r\nsuccessfully made to institute a revival of the \"gentle art\" of hawking.\r\nJulius Firmicus, who lived about that time, is, so far as we can find,\r\nthe first Latin author who speaks of falconers, and the art of teaching\r\none species of birds to fly after and catch others. The occupation of\r\nthese functionaries has now, however, all but ceased. New and nobler\r\nefforts characterize the aims of mankind in the development of their\r\ncivilization, and the sports of the field have, to a large extent, been\r\nsuperseded by other exercises, it may be less healthful and\r\ninvigorating, but certainly more elegant, intellectual, and humanizing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST BLACK-COCK.\r\n\r\n1019. INGREDIENTS.--Black-cock, butter, toast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST BLACK-COCK.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let these birds hang for a few days, or they will be tough and\r\ntasteless, if not well kept. Pluck and draw them, and wipe the insides\r\nand outsides with a damp cloth, as washing spoils the flavour. Cut off\r\nthe heads, and truss them, the same as a roast fowl, cutting off the\r\ntoes, and scalding and peeling the feet. Trussing them with the head on,\r\nas shown in the engraving, is still practised by many cooks, but the\r\nformer method is now considered the best. Put them down to a brisk fire,\r\nwell baste them with butter, and serve with a piece of toast under, and\r\na good gravy and bread sauce. After trussing, some cooks cover the\r\nbreast with vine-leaves and slices of bacon, and then roast them. They\r\nshould be served in the same manner and with the same accompaniments as\r\nwith the plainly-roasted birds.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--45 to 50 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 5s. to 6s. the brace; but seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--2 or 3 for a dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the middle of August to the end of December.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLACK-COCK.]\r\n\r\n    THE BLACK-COCK, HEATH-COCK, MOOR-FOWL, OR HEATH-POULT.--This\r\n    bird sometimes weighs as much as four pounds, and the hen about\r\n    two. It is at present confined to the more northern parts of\r\n    Britain, culture and extending population having united in\r\n    driving it into more desolate regions, except, perhaps, in a few\r\n    of the more wild and less-frequented portions of England. It may\r\n    still be found in the New Forest, in Hampshire, Dartmoor, and\r\n    Sedgmoor, in Devonshire, and among the hills of Somersetshire,\r\n    contiguous to the latter. It may also be found in Staffordshire,\r\n    in North Wales, and again in the north of England; but nowhere\r\n    so plentiful as in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland. The\r\n    males are hardly distinguishable from the females until they are\r\n    about half-grown, when the black feathers begin to appear, first\r\n    about the sides and breast. Their food consists of the tops of\r\n    birch and heath, except when the mountain berries are ripe, at\r\n    which period they eagerly and even voraciously pick the\r\n    bilberries and cranberries from the bushes. Large numbers of\r\n    these birds are found in Norway, almost rivalling the turkey in\r\n    point of size. Some of them have begun to be imported into\r\n    London, where they are vended in the shops; but the flavour of\r\n    their flesh is not equal to that of the Scotch bird.\r\n\r\nHASHED WILD DUCK.\r\n\r\n1020. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast wild duck, 1 pint of good\r\nbrown gravy, 2 tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, 1 glass of claret, salt,\r\ncayenne, and mixed spices to taste; 1 tablespoonful of lemon or Seville\r\norange-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the remains of the duck into neat joints, put them into a\r\nstewpan, with all the above ingredients; let them get gradually hot by\r\nthe side of the fire, and occasionally stir the contents; when on the\r\npoint of boiling, serve, and garnish the dish with sippets of toasted\r\nbread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to February.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGOUT OF WILD DUCK.\r\n\r\n1021. INGREDIENTS.--2 wild ducks, 4 shalots, 1 pint of stock No. 105, 1\r\nglass of port wine, 1 oz. of butter, a little flour, the juice of 1/2\r\nlemon, cayenne and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Ducks that have been dressed and left from the preceding day\r\nwill answer for this dish. Cut them into joints, reserve the legs,\r\nwings, and breasts until wanted; put the trimmings into a stewpan with\r\nthe shalots and stock, and let them simmer for about 1/2 hour, and\r\nstrain the gravy. Put the butter into a stewpan; when melted, dredge in\r\na little flour, and pour in the gravy made from the bones; give it one\r\nboil, and strain it again; add the wine, lemon-juice, and cayenne; lay\r\nin the pieces of duck, and let the whole gradually warm through, but do\r\nnot allow it to boil, or the duck will be hard. The gravy should not be\r\ntoo thick, and should be very highly seasoned. The squeeze of a Seville\r\norange is a great improvement to this dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/2 hour to make the gravy; 1/4 hour for the duck\r\ngradually to warm through.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to February.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST WILD DUCK.\r\n\r\n1022. INGREDIENTS.--Wild duck, flour, butter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST WILD DUCK.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Carefully pluck and draw them; Cut off the heads close to the\r\nnecks, leaving sufficient skin to turn over, and do not cut off the\r\nfeet; some twist each leg at the knuckle, and rest the claws on each\r\nside of the breast; others truss them as shown in our Illustration.\r\nRoast the birds before a quick fire, and, when they are first put down,\r\nlet them remain for 5 minutes without basting (this will keep the gravy\r\nin); afterwards baste plentifully with butter, and a few minutes before\r\nserving dredge them lightly with flour; baste well, and send them to\r\ntable nicely frothed, and full of gravy. If overdone, the birds will\r\nlose their flavour. Serve with a good gravy in the dish, or orange\r\ngravy, No. 488; and send to table with them a cut lemon. To take off the\r\nfishy taste which wild fowl sometimes have, baste them for a few minutes\r\nwith hot water to which have been added an onion and a little salt; then\r\ntake away the pan, and baste with butter.--See coloured plate, G1.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--When liked underdressed, 20 to 25 minutes; well done, 25 to 35\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4s. to 5s. the couple.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--2 for a dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to February.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WILD DUCK.]\r\n\r\n    THE WILD DUCK.--The male of the wild dock is called a mallard;\r\n    and the young ones are called flappers. The time to try to find\r\n    a brood of these is about the month of July, among the rushes of\r\n    the deepest and most retired parts of some brook or stream,\r\n    where, if the old bird is sprung, it may be taken as a certainty\r\n    that its brood is not far off. When once found, flappers are\r\n    easily killed, as they attain their full growth before their\r\n    wings are fledged. Consequently, the sport is more like hunting\r\n    water-rats than shooting birds. When the flappers take wing,\r\n    they assume the name of wild ducks, and about the month of\r\n    August repair to the corn-fields, where they remain until they\r\n    are disturbed by the harvest-people. They then frequent the\r\n    rivers pretty early in the evening, and give excellent sport to\r\n    those who have patience to wait for them. In order to know a\r\n    wild duck, it is necessary only to look at the claws, which\r\n    should be black.\r\n\r\nHASHED GAME (Cold Meat Cookery).\r\n\r\n1023. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold game, 1 onion stuck with 3\r\ncloves, a few whole peppers, a strip of lemon-peel, salt to taste,\r\nthickening of butter and flour, 1 glass of port wine, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nlemon-juice, 1 tablespoonful of ketchup, 1 pint of water or weak stock.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the remains of cold game into joints, reserve the best\r\npieces, and the inferior ones and trimmings put into a stewpan with the\r\nonion, pepper, lemon-peel, salt, and water or weak stock; stew these for\r\nabout an hour, and strain the gravy; thicken it with butter and flour;\r\nadd the wine, lemon-juice, and ketchup; lay in the pieces of game, and\r\nlet them gradually warm through by the side of the fire; do not allow it\r\nto boil, or the game will be hard. When on the point of simmering,\r\nserve, and garnish the dish with sippets of toasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1-1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Any kind of game may be hashed by the above recipe, and the\r\nflavour may be varied by adding flavoured vinegars, curvy powder, &c.;\r\nbut we cannot recommend these latter ingredients, as a dish of game\r\nshould really have a gamy taste; and if too many sauces, essences, &c.,\r\nare added to the gravy, they quite overpower and destroy the flavour the\r\ndish should possess.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUSE PIE.\r\n\r\n1024. INGREDIENTS.--Grouse; cayenne, salt, and pepper to taste; 1 lb. of\r\nrump-steak, 1/2 pint of well-seasoned broth, puff paste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Line the bottom of a pie-dish with the rump-steak cut into neat\r\npieces, and, should the grouse be large, cut them into joints; but, if\r\nsmall, they may be laid in the pie whole; season highly with salt,\r\ncayenne, and black pepper; pour in the broth, and cover with a puff\r\npaste; brush the crust over with the yolk of an egg, and bake from 3/4\r\nto 1 hour. If the grouse is cut into joints, the backbones and trimmings\r\nwill make the gravy, by stewing them with an onion, a little sherry, a\r\nbunch of herbs, and a blade of mace: this should be poured in after the\r\npie is baked.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 to 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the grouse, which are seldom bought, 1s.\r\n9d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the 12th of August to the beginning of December.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST GROUSE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST GROUSE.]\r\n\r\n1025. INGREDIENTS.--Grouse, butter, a thick slice of toasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the birds hang as long as possible; pluck and draw them;\r\nwipe, but do not wash them, inside and out, and truss them without the\r\nhead, the same as for a roast fowl. Many persons still continue to truss\r\nthem with the head under the wing, but the former is now considered the\r\nmost approved method. Put them down to a sharp clear fire; keep them\r\nwell basted the whole of the time they are cooking, and serve them on a\r\nbuttered toast, soaked in the dripping-pan, with a little melted butter\r\npoured over them, or with bread-sauce and gravy.--See coloured plate,\r\nL1.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour; if liked very thoroughly done, 35 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. to 2s. 6d. the brace; but seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--2 for a dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the 12th of August to the beginning of December.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED GROUSE.]\r\n\r\n    GROUSE.--These birds are divided into wood grouse, black grouse,\r\n    red grouse, and white grouse. The wood grouse is further\r\n    distinguished as the cock of the wood, or capercalzie, and is as\r\n    large as the turkey, being about two feet nine inches in length,\r\n    and weighing from twelve to fifteen pounds. The female is\r\n    considerably less than the male, and, in the colour of her\r\n    feathers, differs widely from the other. This beautiful species\r\n    is found principally in lofty, mountainous regions, and is very\r\n    rare in Great Britain; but in the pine forests of Russia,\r\n    Sweden, and other northern countries, it is very common. In\r\n    these it has its habitat, feeding on the cones of the trees, and\r\n    the fruits of various kinds of plants, especially the berry of\r\n    the jumper. Black grouse is also distinguished as black-game, or\r\n    the black-cock. It is not larger than the common hen, and weighs\r\n    only about four pounds. The female is about one-third less than\r\n    the male, and also differs considerably from him in point of\r\n    colour. Like the former, they are found chiefly in high\r\n    situations, and are common in Russia, Siberia, and other\r\n    northern countries. They are also found in the northern parts of\r\n    Great Britain, feeding in winter on the various berries and\r\n    fruits belonging to mountainous countries, and, in summer,\r\n    frequently descending to the lower lands, to feed upon corn. The\r\n    red grouse, gorcock, or moor-cock, weighs about nineteen ounces,\r\n    and the female somewhat less. In the wild heathy tracts of the\r\n    northern counties of England it is plentiful, also in Wales and\r\n    the Highlands of Scotland. Mr. Pennant considered it peculiar to\r\n    Britain, those found in the mountainous parts of Spain, France,\r\n    and Italy, being only varieties of the same bird. White grouse,\r\n    white game, or ptarmigan, is nearly the same size as the red\r\n    grouse, and is found in lofty situations, where it supports\r\n    itself in the severest weather. It is to be met with in most of\r\n    the northern countries of Europe, and appears even in Greenland.\r\n    In the Hebrides, Orkneys, and the Highlands of Scotland, it is\r\n    also found; and sometimes, though rarely, among the fells of\r\n    Northumberland and Cumberland. In winter they fly in flocks, and\r\n    are so little familiar with the sight of man, that they are\r\n    easily shot, and even snared. They feed on the wild produce of\r\n    the hills, which sometimes imparts to their flesh a bitter but\r\n    not unpalatable taste. According to Buffon, it is dark-coloured,\r\n    and somewhat flavoured like the hare.\r\n\r\nGROUSE SALAD.\r\n\r\n(_Soyer's Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n1026. INGREDIENTS.--8 eggs, butter, fresh salad, 1 or 2 grouse; for the\r\nsauce, 1 teaspoonful of minced shalot, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar,\r\nthe yolk of 1 egg, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, 1/4 oz. of salt, 4\r\ntablespoonfuls of oil, 2 tablespoonfuls of Chili vinegar, 1 gill of\r\ncream.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the eggs hard, shell them, throw them into cold water cut\r\na thin slice off the bottom to facilitate the proper placing of them in\r\nthe dish, cut each one into four lengthwise, and make a very thin flat\r\nborder of butter, about one inch from the edge of the dish the salad is\r\nto be served on; fix the pieces of egg upright close to each other, the\r\nyolk outside, or the yolk and white alternately; lay in the centre a\r\nfresh salad of whatever is in season, and, having previously roasted the\r\ngrouse rather underdone, cut it into eight or ten pieces, and prepare\r\nthe sauce as follows:--Put the shalots into a basin, with the sugar, the\r\nyolk of an egg, the parsley, and salt, and mix in by degrees the oil and\r\nvinegar; when these ingredients are well mixed, put the sauce on ice or\r\nin a cool place. When ready to serve, whip the cream rather thick, which\r\nlightly mix with it; then lay the inferior parts of the grouse on the\r\nsalad, sauce over so as to cover each piece, then lay over the salad and\r\nthe remainder of the grouse, pour the rest of the sauce over, and serve.\r\nThe eggs may be ornamented with a little dot of radishes or beetroot on\r\nthe point. Anchovy and gherkin, cut into small diamonds, may be placed\r\nbetween, or cut gherkins in slices, and a border of them laid round.\r\nTarragon or chervil-leaves are also a pretty addition. The remains of\r\ncold black-game, pheasant, or partridge may be used in the above manner,\r\nand will make a very delicate dish.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the 12th of August to the beginning of December.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAPERCALZIE.]\r\n\r\n    THE CAPERCALZIE.--This bird was to be met with formerly both in\r\n    Ireland and Scotland, but is now extinct. The male lives\r\n    separate from the females, except in the breeding season. Its\r\n    manners and habits are very like those of black grouse, except\r\n    that it seems to be wholly confined to forests of pine, on the\r\n    tender shoots of which it feeds. It is by no means uncommon in\r\n    the woods of Norway, whence we received it. It is also found\r\n    abundant in Russia, Siberia, Italy, and in some portions of the\r\n    Alps. It was, in 1760, last seen in Scotland, in the woods of\r\n    Strathglass. Recent attempts have been made to re-introduce it\r\n    into that country, but without success; principally owing, as we\r\n    should imagine, to the want of sufficient food suitable for its\r\n    sustenance.\r\n\r\n    GROUSE.--Under this general term are included several species of\r\n    game birds, called black, red, woodland, and white grouse. The\r\n    black is larger than the red (see No. 1025), and is not so\r\n    common, and therefore held in higher estimation. The red,\r\n    however, is a bird of exquisite flavour, and is a native of the\r\n    mountainous districts of Scotland and the north of England. It\r\n    feeds on the tops of the heath and the berries that grow amongst\r\n    them: its colour is a rich chestnut, striped with black. The\r\n    woodland, or cock of the wood, is the largest among the bird\r\n    tribes which pass under the denomination of game. It is smaller\r\n    than the turkey, and was originally common in our mountains; but\r\n    it is now to be found only in the mountains of Scotland, though\r\n    it still abounds in the north of Europe, Germany, and in the\r\n    Alps. It is esteemed as delicious eating, and its plumage is\r\n    extremely beautiful. The white grouse, or ptarmigan, is not a\r\n    plentiful bird in Britain; but it is still found in the islands,\r\n    and weighs about half a pound. The London market is supplied by\r\n    Norway and Scotland; those from the former country being\r\n    esteemed the best. When young, it is held in high estimation,\r\n    being considered as little different from common grouse.\r\n\r\nROAST HARE.\r\n\r\n1027. INGREDIENTS.--Hare, forcemeat No. 417, a little milk, butter.\r\n\r\n_Choosing and Trussing_.--Choose a young hare; which may be known by its\r\nsmooth and sharp claws, and by the cleft in the lip not being much\r\nspread. To be eaten in perfection, it must hang for some time; and, if\r\nproperly taken care of, it may be kept for several days. It is better to\r\nhang without being paunched; but should it be previously emptied, wipe\r\nthe inside every day, and sprinkle over it a little pepper and ginger,\r\nto prevent the musty taste which long keeping in the damp occasions, and\r\nwhich also affects the stuffing. After it is skinned, wash it well, and\r\nsoak for an hour in warm water to draw out the blood; if old, let it lie\r\nin vinegar for a short time, but wash it well afterwards in several\r\nwaters. Make a forcemeat by recipe No. 417, wipe the hare dry, fill the\r\nbelly with it, and sew it up. Bring the hind and fore legs close to the\r\nbody towards the head, run a skewer through each, fix the head between\r\nthe shoulders by means of another skewer, and be careful to leave the\r\nears on. Pat a string round the body from skewer to skewer, and tie it\r\nabove the back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST HARE.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--The hare should be kept at a distance from the fire when it is\r\nfirst laid down, or the outside will become dry and hard before the\r\ninside is done. Baste it well with milk for a short time, and afterwards\r\nwith butter; and particular attention must be paid to the basting, so as\r\nto preserve the meat on the back juicy and nutritive. When it is almost\r\nroasted enough, flour the hare, and baste well with butter. When nicely\r\nfrothed, dish it, remove the skewers, and send it to table with a little\r\ngravy in the dish, and a tureen of the same. Red-currant jelly must also\r\nnot be forgotten, as this is an indispensable accompaniment to roast\r\nhare. For economy, good beef dripping may be substituted for the milk\r\nand butter to baste with; but the basting, as we have before stated,\r\nmust be continued without intermission. If the liver is good, it maybe\r\nparboiled, minced, and mixed with the stuffing; but it should not be\r\nused unless quite fresh.--See coloured plate, E1.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A middling-sized hare, 1-1/4 hour; a large hare, 1-1/2 to 2\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 4s. to 6s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to the end of February.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARE.--This little animal is found generally distributed over\r\nEurope, and, indeed, in most parts of the northern world. Its extreme\r\ntimidity is the endowment which Providence has bestowed upon it as a\r\nmeans of defence; it is therefore attentive to every sound, and is\r\nsupplied with ears both long and tubular, with which it can hear with\r\ngreat acuteness. Its eyes, also, are so constructed, and placed so\r\nprominent in its head, that it can see both before and behind it. It\r\nlives entirely upon vegetables, but its flesh is considered dry,\r\nnotwithstanding that it is deemed, in many respects, superior to that of\r\nthe rabbit, being more savoury, and of a much higher flavour. Its\r\ngeneral time of feeding is the evening; but during the day, if not\r\ndisturbed, it adheres closely to its _form_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HARE.]\r\n\r\nPOTTED HARE (a Luncheon or Breakfast Dish).\r\n\r\n1028. INGREDIENTS.--1 hare, a few slices of bacon, a large bunch of\r\nsavoury herbs, 4 cloves, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole allspice, 2 carrots, 2\r\nonions, salt and pepper to taste, 1 pint of water, 2 glasses of sherry.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Skin, empty, and wash the hare; cut it down the middle, and put\r\nit into a stewpan, with a few slices of bacon under and over it; add the\r\nremaining ingredients, and stew very gently until the hare is tender,\r\nand the flesh will separate easily from the bones. When done enough,\r\ntake it up, remove the bones, and pound the meat, _with the bacon_, in a\r\nmortar, until reduced to a perfectly smooth paste. Should it not be\r\nsufficiently seasoned, add a little cayenne, salt, and pounded mace, but\r\nbe careful that these are well mixed with the other ingredients. Press\r\nthe meat into potting-pots, pour over clarified butter, and keep in a\r\ndry place. The liquor that the hare was stewed in, should be saved for\r\nhashes, soups, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 21/2 hours to stew the hare.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to the end of February.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED HARE (a Supper or Luncheon Dish).\r\n\r\n1029. INGREDIENTS.--The leg and shoulders of a roast hare, cayenne and\r\nsalt to taste, a little butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the legs and shoulders of a roast hare, season them highly\r\nwith salt and cayenne, and broil them over a very clear fire for 5\r\nminutes. Dish them on a hot dish, rub over them a little cold butter,\r\nand send to table very quickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to the end of February.\r\n\r\n\r\nHASHED HARE.\r\n\r\n1030. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold roast hare, 1 blade of pounded\r\nmace, 2 or 3 allspice, pepper and salt to taste, 1 onion, a bunch of\r\nsavoury herbs, 3 tablespoonfuls of port wine, thickening of butter and\r\nflour, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the cold hare into neat slices, and put the head, bones,\r\nand trimmings into a stewpan, with 3/4 pint of water; add the mace,\r\nallspice, seasoning, onion, and herbs, and stew for nearly an hour, and\r\nstrain the gravy; thicken it with butter and flour, add the wine and\r\nketchup, and lay in the pieces of hare, with any stuffing that may be\r\nleft. Let the whole gradually heat by the side of the fire, and, when it\r\nhas simmered for about 5 minutes, serve, and garnish the dish with\r\nsippets of toasted bread. Send red-currant jelly to table with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cold hare, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to the end of February.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUGGED HARE.\r\n\r\n(_Very Good_.)\r\n\r\n1031. INGREDIENTS.--1 hare, 1-1/2 lb. of gravy beef, 1/2 lb. of butter,\r\n1 onion, 1 lemon, 6 cloves; pepper, cayenne, and salt to taste; 1/2 pint\r\nof port wine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Skin, paunch, and wash the hare, cut it into pieces, dredge\r\nthem with flour, and fry in boiling butter. Have ready 1-1/2 pint of\r\ngravy, made from the above proportion of beef, and thickened with a\r\nlittle flour. Put this into a jar; add the pieces of fried hare, an\r\nonion stuck with six cloves, a lemon peeled and cut in half, and a good\r\nseasoning of pepper, cayenne, and salt; cover the jar down tightly, put\r\nit up to the neck into a stewpan of boiling water, and let it stew until\r\nthe hare is quite tender, taking care to keep the water boiling. When\r\nnearly done, pour in the wine, and add a few forcemeat balls, made by\r\nrecipe No. 417: these must be fried or baked in the oven for a few\r\nminutes before they are put to the gravy. Serve with red-currant jelly.\r\n\r\n_Time_,--3-1/2 to 4 hours. If the hare is very old, allow 4-1/2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 7s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to the end of February.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n(_A Quicker and more Economical Way_.)\r\n\r\n1032. INGREDIENTS.--1 hare, a bunch of sweet herbs, 2 onions, each stuck\r\nwith 3 cloves, 6 whole allspice, 1/2 teaspoonful of black pepper, a\r\nstrip of lemon-peel, thickening of butter and flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\nmushroom ketchup, 1/4 pint of port wine.\r\n\r\n_Mode._--Wash the hare nicely, cut it up into joints (not too large),\r\nand flour and brown them as in the preceding recipe; then put them into\r\na stewpan with the herbs, onions, cloves, allspice, pepper, and\r\nlemon-peel; cover with hot water, and when it boils, carefully remove\r\nall the scum, and let it simmer gently till tender, which will be in\r\nabout 1-3/4 hour, or longer, should the hare be very old. Take out the\r\npieces of hare, thicken the gravy with flour and butter, add the ketchup\r\nand port wine, let it boil for about 10 minutes, strain it through a\r\nsieve over the hare, and serve. A few fried forcemeat balls should be\r\nadded at the moment of serving, or instead of frying them, they may be\r\nstewed in the gravy, about 10 minutes before the hare is wanted for\r\ntable. Do not omit to serve red-currant jelly with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 2 hours. _Average cost_, 5s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to the end of February.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Should there be any left, rewarm it the next day by putting the\r\nhare, &c. into a covered jar, and placing this jar in a saucepan of\r\nboiling water: this method prevents a great deal of waste.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST LANDRAIL, OR CORN-CRAKE.\r\n\r\n1033. INGREDIENTS.--3 or 4 birds, butter, fried bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDRAILS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pluck and draw the birds, wipe them inside and out with damp\r\ncloths, and truss them in the following manner:--Bring the head round\r\nunder the wing, and the thighs close to the sides; pass a skewer through\r\nthem and the body, and keep the legs straight. Roast them before a clear\r\nfire, keep them well basted, and serve on fried bread crumbs, with a\r\ntureen of brown gravy. When liked, bread-sauce may also be sent to table\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--12 to 20 minutes. _Average cost_,--Seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow--1 for a dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August 12th to the middle of September.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LANDRAIL.]\r\n\r\n    THE LANDRAIL, OR CORN-CRAKE.--This bird is migratory in its\r\n    habits, yet from its formation, it seems ill adapted for long\r\n    aërial passages, its wings being short, and placed so forward\r\n    out of the centre of gravity, that it flies in an extremely\r\n    heavy and embarrassed manner, and with its legs hanging down.\r\n    When it alights, it can hardly be sprung a second time, as it\r\n    runs very fast, and seems to depend for its safety more on the\r\n    swiftness of its feet than the celerity of its wings. It makes\r\n    its appearance in England about the same time as the quail, that\r\n    is, in the months of April and May, and frequents the same\r\n    places. Its singular cry is first heard when the grass becomes\r\n    long enough to shelter it, and it continues to be heard until\r\n    the grass is cut. The bird, however, is seldom seen, for it\r\n    constantly skulks among the thickest portions of the herbage,\r\n    and runs so nimbly through it, doubling and winding in every\r\n    direction, that it is difficult to get near it. It leaves this\r\n    island before the winter, and repairs to other countries in\r\n    search of its food, which principally consists of slugs, large\r\n    numbers of which it destroys. It is very common in Ireland, and,\r\n    whilst migrating to this country, is seen in great numbers in\r\n    the island of Anglesea. On its first arrival in England, it is\r\n    so lean as scarcely to weigh above five or six ounces; before\r\n    its departure, however, it has been known to exceed eight\r\n    ounces, and is then most delicious eating.\r\n\r\nTO DRESS A LEVERET.\r\n\r\n1034. INGREDIENTS.--2 leverets, butter, flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Leverets should be trussed in the same manner as a hare, but\r\nthey do not require stuffing. Roast them before a clear fire, and keep\r\nthem well basted all the time they are cooking. A few minutes before\r\nserving, dredge them lightly with flour, and froth them nicely. Serve\r\nwith plain gravy in the dish, and send to table red-currant jelly with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, in full season, 4s. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from May to August, but cheapest in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED PARTRIDGE (a Luncheon, Breakfast, or Supper Dish).\r\n\r\n1035. INGREDIENTS.--3 partridges, salt and cayenne to taste, a small\r\npiece of butter, brown gravy or mushroom sauce.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pluck, draw, and cut the partridges in half, and wipe the\r\ninside thoroughly with a damp cloth. Season them with salt and cayenne,\r\nbroil them over a very clear fire, and dish them on a hot dish; rub a\r\nsmall piece of butter over each half, and send them to table with brown\r\ngravy or mushroom sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/4 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d. to 2s. a brace.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the 1st of September to the beginning of February.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTRIDGE PIE.\r\n\r\n1036. INGREDIENTS.--3 partridges, pepper and salt to taste, 1\r\nteaspoonful of minced parsley (when obtainable, a few mushrooms), 3/4\r\nlb. of veal cutlet, a slice of ham, 1/2 pint of stock, puff paste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Line a pie-dish with a veal cutlet; over that place a slice of\r\nham and a seasoning of pepper and salt. Pluck, draw, and wipe the\r\npartridges; cut off the legs at the first joint, and season them inside\r\nwith pepper, salt, minced parsley, and a small piece of butter; place\r\nthem in the dish, and pour over the stock; line the edges of the dish\r\nwith puff paste, cover with the same, brush it over with the yolk of an\r\negg, and bake for 3/4 to 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 to 1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d. to 2s. a brace.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the 1st of September to the beginning of February.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote.--Should the partridges be very large, split them in half; they\r\nwill then lie in the dish more compactly. When at hand, a few mushrooms\r\nshould always be added.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTTED PARTRIDGE.\r\n\r\n1037. INGREDIENTS.--Partridges; seasoning to taste of mace, allspice\r\nwhite pepper, and salt; butter, coarse paste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pluck and draw the birds, and wipe them inside with a damp\r\ncloth. Pound well some mace, allspice, white pepper, and salt; mix\r\ntogether, and rub every part of the partridges with this. Pack the birds\r\nas closely as possible in a baking-pan, with plenty of butter over them,\r\nand cover with a coarse flour and water crust. Tie a paper over this,\r\nand bake for rather more than 1-1/2 hour; let the birds get cold, then\r\ncut them into pieces for keeping, pack them closely into a large\r\npotting-pot, and cover with clarified butter. This should be kept in a\r\ncool dry place. The butter used for potted things will answer for\r\nbasting, or for paste for meat pies.--See coloured plate, D1.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the 1st of September to the beginning of February.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALMI DE PERDRIX, or HASHED PARTRIDGES.\r\n\r\n1038. INGREDIENTS.--3 young partridges, 3 shalots, a slice of lean ham,\r\n1 carrot, 3 or 4 mushrooms, a bunch of savoury herbs, 2 cloves, 6 whole\r\npeppers, 3/4 pint of stock, 1 glass of sherry or Madeira, a small lump\r\nof sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--After the partridges are plucked and drawn, roast them rather\r\nunderdone, and cover them with paper, as they should not be browned; cut\r\nthem into joints, take off the skin from the wings, legs, and breasts;\r\nput these into a stewpan, cover them up, and set by until the gravy is\r\nready. Cut a slice of ham into small pieces, and put them, with the\r\ncarrots sliced, the shalots, mushrooms, herbs, cloves, and pepper, into\r\na stewpan; fry them lightly in a little butter, pour in the stock, add\r\nthe bones and trimming from the partridges, and simmer for 1/4 hour.\r\nStrain the gravy, let it cool, and skim off every particle of fat; put\r\nit to the legs, wings, and breasts, add a glass of sherry or Madeira and\r\na small lump of sugar, let all gradually warm through by the side of the\r\nfire, and when on the point of boiling, serve, and garnish the dish with\r\ncroûtons. The remains of roast partridge answer very well dressed in\r\nthis way, although not so good as when the birds are in the first\r\ninstance only half-roasted. This recipe is equally suitable for\r\npheasants, moor-game, &c.; but care must be taken always to skin the\r\njoints.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--2 or 3 partridges for an entrée.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the 1st of September to the beginning of February.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST PARTRIDGE.\r\n\r\n1039. INGREDIENTS.--Partridge; butter.\r\n\r\n_Choosing and Trussing_.--Choose young birds, with dark-coloured bills\r\nand yellowish legs, and let them hang a few days, or there will be no\r\nflavour to the flesh, nor will it be tender. The time they should be\r\nkept, entirely depends on the taste of those for whom they are intended,\r\nas what some persons would consider delicious, would be to others\r\ndisgusting and offensive. They may be trussed with or without the head,\r\nthe latter mode being now considered the most fashionable. Pluck, draw,\r\nand wipe the partridge carefully inside and out; cut off the head,\r\nleaving sufficient skin on the neck to skewer back; bring the legs close\r\nto the breast, between it and the side-bones, and pass a skewer through\r\nthe pinions and the thick part of the thighs. When the head is left on,\r\nit should be brought round and fixed on to the point of the skewer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST PARTRIDGE.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--When the bird is firmly and plumply trussed, roast it before a\r\nnice bright fire; keep it well basted, and a few minutes before serving,\r\nflour and froth it well. Dish it, and serve with gravy and bread sauce,\r\nand send to table hot and quickly. A little of the gravy should be\r\npoured over the bird.--See coloured plate, D1.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--25 to 35 minutes. _Average cost_, is 1s. 6d. to 2s. a brace.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--2 for a dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the 1st of September to the beginning of February.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARTRIDGES.]\r\n\r\n    THE PARTRIDGE.--This bird is to be found in nearly all the\r\n    temperate countries of Europe, but is most abundant in the\r\n    Ukraine, although it is unable to bear the extremes of climate,\r\n    whether hot or cold. It was formerly very common in France, and\r\n    is considered a table luxury in England. The instinct of this\r\n    bird is frequently exemplified in a remarkable manner, for the\r\n    preservation of its young. \"I have seen it often,\" says a very\r\n    celebrated writer, and an accurate observer of nature, \"and once\r\n    in particular, I saw an extraordinary instance of an old bird's\r\n    solicitude to save its brood. As I was hunting with a young\r\n    pointer, the dog ran on a brood of very small partridges; the\r\n    old bird cried, fluttered, and ran tumbling along just before\r\n    the dog's nose, till she had drawn him to a considerable\r\n    distance, when she took wing, and flew still further off, but\r\n    not out of the field; on this the dog returned to me, near the\r\n    place where the young ones lay concealed in the grass, which the\r\n    old bird no sooner perceived than she flew back to us, settled\r\n    just before the dog's nose again, and by rolling and tumbling\r\n    about, drew off his attention from her young, and thus preserved\r\n    her brood a second time. I have also seen, when a kite has been\r\n    hovering over a covey of young partridges, the old birds fly up\r\n    at the bird of prey, screaming and fighting with all their might\r\n    to preserve their brood.\" Partridges should be chosen young; if\r\n    old, they are valueless. The young ones are generally known by\r\n    their yellow legs and dark-coloured bills.\r\n\r\nPHEASANT CUTLETS.\r\n\r\n1040. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 pheasants, egg and bread crumbs, cayenne and\r\nsalt to taste, brown gravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure 3 young pheasants that have been hung a few days;\r\npluck, draw, and wipe them inside; cut them into joints; remove the\r\nbones from the best of these; and the backbones, trimmings, &c., put\r\ninto a stewpan, with a little stock, herbs, vegetables, seasoning, &c.,\r\nto make the gravy. Flatten and trim the cutlets of a good shape, egg and\r\nbread crumb them, broil them over a clear fire, pile them high in the\r\ndish, and pour under them the gravy made from the bones, which should be\r\nstrained, flavoured, and thickened. One of the small bones should be\r\nstuck on the point of each cutlet.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes. _Average cost_, 2s. 6d. to 3s. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 entrées.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the 1st of October to the beginning of February.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST PHEASANT.\r\n\r\n1041. INGREDIENTS.--Pheasant, flour, butter.\r\n\r\n_Choosing and Trussing_.--Old pheasants may be known by the length and\r\nsharpness of their spurs; in young ones they are short and blunt. The\r\ncock bird is generally reckoned the best, except when the hen is with\r\negg. They should hang some time before they are dressed, as, if they are\r\ncooked fresh, the flesh will be exceedingly dry and tasteless. After the\r\nbird is plucked and drawn, wipe the inside with a damp cloth, and truss\r\nit in the same manner as partridge, No. 1039. If the head is left on, as\r\nshown in the engraving, bring it round under the wing, and fix it on to\r\nthe point of the skewer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST PHEASANT.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Roast it before a brisk fire, keep it well basted, and flour\r\nand froth it nicely. Serve with brown gravy, a little of which should be\r\npoured round the bird, and a tureen of bread sauce. 2 or 3 of the\r\npheasant's best tail-feathers are sometimes stuck in the tail as an\r\nornament; but the fashion is not much to be commended.--See coloured\r\nplate, F1.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 1 hour, according to the size.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. 6d. to 3s. each. _Sufficient_,--1 for a dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the 1st of October to the beginning of February.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PHEASANT.]\r\n\r\n    THE PHEASANT.--This beautiful bird is said to have been\r\n    discovered by the Argonauts on the banks of the Phasis, near\r\n    Mount Ararat, in their expedition to Colchis. It is common,\r\n    however, in almost all the southern parts of the European\r\n    continent, and has been long naturalized in the warmest and most\r\n    woody counties of England. It is very common in France; indeed,\r\n    so common as to be esteemed a nuisance by the farmers. Although\r\n    it has been domesticated, this is not easily accomplished, nor\r\n    is its flesh so palatable then as it is in the wild state. Mr.\r\n    Ude says--\"It is not often that pheasants are met with\r\n    possessing that exquisite taste which is acquired only by long\r\n    keeping, as the damp of this climate prevents their being kept\r\n    as long as they are in other countries. The hens, in general,\r\n    are the most delicate. The cocks show their age by their spurs.\r\n    They are only fit to be eaten when the blood begins to run from\r\n    the bill, which is commonly six days or a week after they have\r\n    been killed. The flesh is white, tender, and has a good flavour,\r\n    if you keep it long enough; if not, it is not much different\r\n    from that of a common fowl or hen.\"\r\n\r\nBRILLAT SAVARIN'S RECIPE FOR ROAST PHEASANT, a la Sainte Alliance.\r\n\r\n1042. When the pheasant is in good condition to be cooked (_see_ No.\r\n1041), it should be plucked, and not before. The bird should then be\r\nstuffed in the following manner:--Take two snipes, and draw them,\r\nputting the bodies on one plate, and the livers, &c., on another. Take\r\noff the flesh, and mince it finely with a little beef, lard, a few\r\ntruffles, pepper and salt to taste, and stuff the pheasant carefully\r\nwith this. Cut a slice of bread, larger considerably than the bird, and\r\ncover it with the liver, &c., and a few truffles: an anchovy and a\r\nlittle fresh butter added to these will do no harm. Put the bread, &c.,\r\ninto the dripping-pan, and, when the bird is roasted, place it on the\r\npreparation, and surround it with Florida oranges.\r\n\r\nDo not be uneasy, Savarin adds, about your dinner; for a pheasant served\r\nin this way is fit for beings better than men. The pheasant itself is a\r\nvery good bird; and, imbibing the dressing and the flavour of the\r\ntruffle and snipe, it becomes thrice better.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED PHEASANT (a Breakfast or Luncheon Dish).\r\n\r\n1043. INGREDIENTS.--1 pheasant, a little lard, egg and bread crumbs,\r\nsalt and cayenne to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the legs off at the first joint, and the remainder of the\r\nbird into neat pieces; put them into a fryingpan with a little lard, and\r\nwhen browned on both sides, and about half done, take them out and drain\r\nthem; brush the pieces over with egg, and sprinkle with bread crumbs\r\nwith which has been mixed a good seasoning of cayenne and salt. Broil\r\nthem over a moderate fire for about 10 minutes, or rather longer, and\r\nserve with mushroom-sauce, sauce piquante, or brown gravy, in which a\r\nfew game-bones and trimmings have been stewed.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1/2 hour. _Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the 1st of October to the beginning of February.\r\n\r\n    THE HEIGHT OF EXCELLENCE IN A PHEASANT.--Things edible have\r\n    their degrees of excellence under various circumstances: thus,\r\n    asparagus, capers, peas, and partridges are best when young.\r\n    Perfection in others is only reached when they attain maturity:\r\n    let us say, for example, melons and nearly all fruits (we must\r\n    except, perhaps, the medlar), with the majority of those animals\r\n    whose flesh we eat. But others, again, are not good until\r\n    decomposition is about to set in; and here we may mention\r\n    particularly the snipe and the pheasant. If the latter bird be\r\n    eaten so soon as three days after it has been killed, it then\r\n    has no peculiarity of flavour; a pullet would be more relished,\r\n    and a quail would surpass it in aroma. Kept, however, a proper\r\n    length of time,--and this can be ascertained by a slight smell\r\n    and change of colour,--then it becomes a highly, flavoured dish,\r\n    occupying, so to speak, the middle distance between chicken and\r\n    venison. It is difficult to define any exact time to \"hang\" a\r\n    pheasant; but any one possessed of the instincts of\r\n    gastronomical science, can at once detect the right moment when\r\n    a pheasant should be taken down, in the same way as a good cook\r\n    knows whether a bird should be removed from the spit, or have a\r\n    turn or two more.\r\n\r\nTO DRESS PLOVERS.\r\n\r\n1044. INGREDIENTS.--3 plovers, butter, flour, toasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Choosing and Trussing_.--Choose those that feel hard at the vent, as\r\nthat shows their fatness. There are three sorts,--the grey, green, and\r\nbastard plover, or lapwing. They will keep good for some time, but if\r\nvery stale, the feet will be very dry. Plovers are scarcely fit for\r\nanything but roasting; they are, however, sometimes stewed, or made into\r\na ragoût, but this mode of cooking is not to be recommended.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pluck off the feathers, wipe the outside of the birds with a\r\ndamp cloth, and do not draw them; truss with the head under the wing,\r\nput them down to a clear fire, and lay slices of moistened toast in the\r\ndripping-pan, to catch the trail. Keep them _well basted_, dredge them\r\nlightly with flour a few minutes before they are done, and let them be\r\nnicely frothed. Dish them on the toasts, over which the _trail_ should\r\nbe equally spread. Pour round the toast a little good gravy, and send\r\nsome to table in a tureen.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to 1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d. the brace, if plentiful.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--In perfection from the beginning of September to the end\r\nof January.\r\n\r\n    THE PLOVER.--There are two species of this bird, the grey and\r\n    the green, the former being larger than the other, and somewhat\r\n    less than the woodcock. It has generally been classed with those\r\n    birds which chiefly live in the water; but it would seem only to\r\n    seek its food there, for many of the species breed upon the\r\n    loftiest mountains. Immense flights of these birds are to be\r\n    seen in the Hebrides, and other parts of Scotland; and, in the\r\n    winter, large numbers are sent to the London market, which is\r\n    sometimes so much glutted with them that they are sold very\r\n    cheap. Previous to dressing, they are kept till they have a game\r\n    flavour; and although their flesh is a favourite with many, it\r\n    is not universally relished. The green is preferred to the grey,\r\n    but both are inferior to the woodcock. Their eggs are esteemed\r\n    as a great delicacy. Birds of this kind are migratory. They\r\n    arrive in England in April, live with us all the spring and\r\n    summer, and at the beginning of autumn prepare to take leave by\r\n    getting together in flocks. It is supposed that they then retire\r\n    to Spain, and frequent the sheep-walks with which that country\r\n    abounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PLOVER.]\r\n\r\nTO DRESS THE PTARMIGAN.\r\n\r\n1045. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 birds; butter, flour, fried bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--The ptarmigan, or white grouse, when young and tender, are\r\nexceedingly fine eating, and should be kept as long as possible, to be\r\ngood. Pluck, draw, and truss them in the same manner as grouse, No.\r\n1025, and roast them before a brisk fire. Flour and froth them nicely,\r\nand serve on buttered toast, with a tureen of brown gravy. Bread sauce,\r\nwhen liked, may be sent to table with them, and fried bread crumbs\r\nsubstituted for the toasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/2 hour. _Sufficient_,--2 for a dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the beginning of February to the end of April.\r\n\r\n    THE PTARMIGAN, OR WHITE GROUSE.--This bird is nearly the same\r\n    size as red grouse, and is fond of lofty situations, where it\r\n    braves the severest weather, and is found in most parts of\r\n    Europe, as well as in Greenland. At Hudson's Bay they appear in\r\n    such multitudes that so many as sixty or seventy are frequently\r\n    taken at once in a net. As they are as tame as chickens, this is\r\n    done without difficulty. Buffon says that the Ptarmigan avoids\r\n    the solar heat, and prefers the frosts of the summits of the\r\n    mountains; for, as the snow melts on the sides of the mountains,\r\n    it ascends till it gains the top, where it makes a hole, and\r\n    burrows in the snow. In winter, it flies in flocks, and feeds on\r\n    the wild vegetation of the hills, which imparts to its flesh a\r\n    bitter, but not altogether an unpalatable taste. It is\r\n    dark-coloured, and has something of the flavour of the hare, and\r\n    is greatly relished, and much sought after by some sportsmen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PTARMIGAN.]\r\n\r\nTO DRESS QUAILS.\r\n\r\n1046. INGREDIENTS.--Quails, butter, toast.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--These birds keep good several days, and should be roasted\r\nwithout drawing. Truss them in the same manner as woodcocks, No. 1062;\r\nroast them before a clear fire, keep them well basted, and serve on\r\ntoast.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 20 minutes. _Average cost_.--Seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ 2 for a dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to December.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE QUAIL.]\r\n\r\n    THE QUAIL.--Quails are almost universally diffused over Europe,\r\n    Asia, and Africa. Being birds of passage, they are seen in\r\n    immense flocks, traversing the Mediterranean Sea from Europe to\r\n    Africa, in the autumn, and returning again in the spring,\r\n    frequently alighting in their passage on many of the islands of\r\n    the Archipelago, which, with their vast numbers, they almost\r\n    completely cover. On the western coasts of the kingdom of\r\n    Naples, they have appeared in such prodigious numbers, that,\r\n    within the compass of four or five miles, as many as a hundred\r\n    thousand have been taken in a day. \"From these circumstances,\"\r\n    says a writer on natural history, \"it appears highly probable\r\n    that the quails which supplied the Israelites with food during\r\n    their journey through the wilderness, were sent thither, on\r\n    their passage to the north, by a wind from the south-west,\r\n    sweeping over Egypt and Ethiopia towards the shores of the Red\r\n    Sea.\" In England they are not very numerous, although they breed\r\n    in it; and many of them are said to remain throughout the year,\r\n    changing their quarters from the interior parts of the country\r\n    for the seacoast.\r\n\r\nTO DRESS SNIPES.\r\n\r\n1047. INGREDIENTS.--Snipes, butter, flour, toast.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--These, like woodcocks, should be dressed without being drawn.\r\nPluck, and wipe them outside, and truss them with the head under the\r\nwing, having previously skinned that and the neck. Twist the legs at the\r\nfirst joint, press the feet upon the thighs, and pass a skewer through\r\nthese and the body. Place four on a skewer, tie them on to the jack or\r\nspit, and roast before a clear fire for about 1/4 hour. Put some pieces\r\nof buttered toast into the dripping-pan to catch the trails; flour and\r\nfroth the birds nicely, dish the pieces of toast with the snipes on\r\nthem, and pour round, but not over them, a little good brown gravy. They\r\nshould be sent to table very hot and expeditiously, or they will not be\r\nworth eating.--See coloured plate M1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST SNIPE.]\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/4 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d. to 2s. the brace.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--4 for a dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to February.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Ortolans are trussed and dressed in the same manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SNIPE.]\r\n\r\n    THE SNIPE.--This is a migratory bird, and is generally\r\n    distributed over Europe. It is found in most parts of England,\r\n    in the high as well as the low lands, depending much on the\r\n    weather. In very wet seasons it resorts to the hills, but at\r\n    other times frequents marshes, where it can penetrate the earth\r\n    with its bill, hunting for worms, which form its principal food.\r\n    In the Hebrides and the Orkneys snipes are plentiful, and they\r\n    are fattest in frosty weather. In the breeding season the snipe\r\n    changes its note entirely from that which it has in the winter.\r\n    The male will keep on wing for an hour together, mounting like a\r\n    lark, and uttering a shrill piping noise; then, with a bleating\r\n    sound, not unlike that made by an old goat, it will descend with\r\n    great velocity, especially if the female be sitting in her nest,\r\n    from which it will not wander far.\r\n\r\nROAST TEAL.\r\n\r\n1048. INGREDIENTS.--Teal, butter, a little flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose fat plump birds, after the frost has set in, as they are\r\ngenerally better flavoured; truss them in the same manner as wild duck,\r\nNo. 1022; roast them before a brisk fire, and keep them well basted.\r\nServe with brown or orange gravy, water-cresses, and a cut lemon. The\r\nremains of teal make excellent hash.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 9 to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. each; but seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--2 for a dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to February.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST HAUNCH OF VENISON.\r\n\r\n1049. INGREDIENTS.--Venison, coarse flour-and-water paste, a little\r\nflour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose a haunch with clear, bright, and thick fat, and the\r\ncleft of the hoof smooth and close; the greater quantity of fat there\r\nis, the better quality will the meat be. As many people object to\r\nvenison when it has too much _haut goût_, ascertain how long it has been\r\nkept, by running a sharp skewer into the meat close to the bone; when\r\nthis is withdrawn, its sweetness can be judged of. With care and\r\nattention, it will keep good a fortnight, unless the weather is very\r\nmild. Keep it perfectly dry by wiping it with clean cloths till not the\r\nleast damp remains, and sprinkle over powdered ginger or pepper, as a\r\npreventative against the fly. When required for use, wash it in warm\r\nwater, and _dry_ it _well_ with a cloth; butter a sheet of white paper,\r\nput it over the fat, lay a coarse paste, about 1/2 inch in thickness,\r\nover this, and then a sheet or two of strong paper. Tie the whole firmly\r\non to the haunch with twine, and put the joint down to a strong close\r\nfire; baste the venison immediately, to prevent the paper and string\r\nfrom burning, and continue this operation, without intermission, the\r\nwhole of the time it is cooking. About 20 minutes before it is done,\r\ncarefully remove the paste and paper, dredge the joint with flour, and\r\nbaste well with _butter_ until it is nicely frothed, and of a nice\r\npale-brown colour; garnish the knuckle-bone with a frill of white paper,\r\nand serve with a good, strong, but unflavoured gravy, in a tureen, and\r\ncurrant jelly; or melt the jelly with a little port wine, and serve that\r\nalso in a tureen. As the principal object in roasting venison is to\r\npreserve the fat, the above is the best mode of doing so where expense\r\nis not objected to; but, in ordinary cases, the paste may be dispensed\r\nwith, and a double paper placed over the roast instead: it will not\r\nrequire so long cooking without the paste. Do not omit to send very hot\r\nplates to table, as the venison fat so soon freezes: to be thoroughly\r\nenjoyed by epicures, it should be eaten on hot-water plates. The neck\r\nand shoulder may be roasted in the same manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST HAUNCH OF VENISON.]\r\n\r\n_Time_.--A large haunch of buck venison, with the paste, 4 to 5 hours;\r\nhaunch of doe venison, 3-1/4 to 3-3/4 hours. Allow less time without the\r\npaste.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 4d. to 1s. 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 18 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Buck venison in greatest perfection from June to\r\nMichaelmas; doe venison from November to the end of January.\r\n\r\n    THE DEER.--This active tribe of animals principally inhabit wild\r\n    and woody regions. In their contentions, both with each other\r\n    and the rest of the brute creation, these animals not only use\r\n    their horns, but strike very furiously with their fore feet.\r\n    Some of the species are employed as beasts of draught, whilst\r\n    the flesh of the whole is wholesome, and that of some of the\r\n    kinds, under the name of \"venison,\" is considered very\r\n    delicious. Persons fond of hunting have invented peculiar terms\r\n    by which the objects of their pursuit are characterized: thus\r\n    the stag is called, the first year, a _calf_, or _hind-calf_;\r\n    the second, a _knobber_; the third, a _brock_; the fourth, a\r\n    _staggard_; the fifth, a _stag_; and the sixth, a _hart_. The\r\n    female is, the first year, called a _calf_; the second, a\r\n    _hearse_; and the third, a _hind_. In Britain, the stag has\r\n    become scarcer than it formerly was; but, in the Highlands of\r\n    Scotland, herds of four or five hundred may still be seen,\r\n    ranging over the vast mountains of the north; and some of the\r\n    stags of a great size. In former times, the great feudal\r\n    chieftains used to hunt with all the pomp of eastern sovereigns,\r\n    assembling some thousands of their clans, who drove the deer\r\n    into the toils, or to such stations as were occupied by their\r\n    chiefs. As this sport, however, was occasionally used as a means\r\n    for collecting their vassals together for the purpose of\r\n    concocting rebellion, an act was passed prohibitory of such\r\n    assemblages. In the \"Waverley\" of Sir Walter Scott, a\r\n    deer-hunting scene of this kind is admirably described.\r\n\r\n    VENISON.--This is the name given to the flesh of some kinds of\r\n    deer, and is esteemed as very delicious. Different species of\r\n    deer are found in warm as well as cold climates, and are in\r\n    several instances invaluable to man. This is especially the case\r\n    with the Laplander, whose reindeer constitutes a large\r\n    proportion of his wealth. There--\r\n\r\n      \"The reindeer unharness'd in freedom can play,\r\n      And safely o'er Odin's steep precipice stray,\r\n      Whilst the wolf to the forest recesses may fly,\r\n      And howl to the moon as she glides through the sky.\"\r\n\r\n    In that country it is the substitute for the horse, the cow, the\r\n    goat, and the sheep. From its milk is produced cheese; from its\r\n    skin, clothing; from its tendons, bowstrings and thread; from\r\n    its horns, glue; from its bones, spoons; and its flesh furnishes\r\n    food. In England we have the stag, an animal of great beauty,\r\n    and much admired. He is a native of many parts of Europe, and is\r\n    supposed to have been originally introduced into this country\r\n    from France. About a century back he was to be found wild in\r\n    some of the rough and mountainous parts of Wales, as well as in\r\n    the forests of Exmoor, in Devonshire, and the woods on the banks\r\n    of the Tamar. In the middle ages the deer formed food for the\r\n    not over abstemious monks, as represented by Friar Tuck's\r\n    larder, in the admirable fiction of \"Ivanhoe;\" and at a later\r\n    period it was a deer-stealing adventure that drove the\r\n    \"ingenious\" William Shakspeare to London, to become a common\r\n    player, and the greatest dramatist that ever lived.\r\n\r\nHASHED VENISON.\r\n\r\n1050. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of roast venison, its own or mutton\r\ngravy, thickening of butter and flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the meat from the bones in neat slices, and, if there is\r\nsufficient of its own gravy left, put the meat into this, as it is\r\npreferable to any other. Should there not be enough, put the bones and\r\ntrimmings into a stewpan, with about a pint of mutton gravy; let them\r\nstew gently for an hour, and strain the gravy. Put a little flour and\r\nbutter into the stewpan, keep stirring until brown, then add the\r\nstrained gravy, and give it a boil up; skim and strain again, and, when\r\na little cool, put in the slices of venison. Place the stewpan by the\r\nside of the fire, and, when on the point of simmering, serve: do not\r\nallow it to boil, or the meat will be hard. Send red-currant jelly to\r\ntable with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Buck venison, from June to Michaelmas; doe venison, from\r\nNovember to the end of January.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A small quantity of Harvey's sauce, ketchup, or port wine, may\r\nbe added to enrich the gravy: these ingredients must, however, be used\r\nvery sparingly, or they will overpower the flavour of the venison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FALLOW-DEER (BUCK). FALLOW-DEER (DOE).]\r\n\r\n    THE FALLOW-DEER.--This is the domestic or park deer; and no two\r\n    animals can make a nearer approach to each other than the stag\r\n    and it, and yet no two animals keep more distinct, or avoid each\r\n    other with a more inveterate animosity. They never herd or\r\n    intermix together, and consequently never give rise to an\r\n    intermediate race; it is even rare, unless they have been\r\n    transported thither, to find fellow-deer in a country where\r\n    stags are numerous. He is very easily tamed, and feeds upon many\r\n    things which the stag refuses: he also browzes closer than the\r\n    stag, and preserves his venison better. The doe produces one\r\n    fawn, sometimes two, but rarely three. In short, they resemble\r\n    the stag in all his natural habits, and the greatest difference\r\n    between them is the duration of their lives: the stag, it is\r\n    said, lives to the age of thirty-five or forty years, and the\r\n    fallow-deer does not live more than twenty. As they are smaller\r\n    than the stag, it is probable that their growth is sooner\r\n    completed.\r\n\r\nSTEWED VENISON.\r\n\r\n1051. INGREDIENTS.--A shoulder of venison, a few slices of mutton fat, 2\r\nglasses of port wine, pepper and allspice to taste, 1-1/2 pint of weak\r\nstock or gravy, 1/2 teaspoonful of whole pepper, 1/2 teaspoonful of\r\nwhole allspice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Hang the venison till tender; take out the bone, flatten the\r\nmeat with a rolling-pin, and place over it a few slices of mutton fat,\r\nwhich have been previously soaked for 2 or 3 hours in port wine;\r\nsprinkle these with a little fine allspice and pepper, roll the meat up,\r\nand bind and tie it securely. Put it into a stewpan with the bone and\r\nthe above proportion of weak stock or gravy, whole allspice, black\r\npepper, and port wine; cover the lid down closely, and simmer, very\r\ngently, from 3-1/2 to 4 hours. When quite tender, take off the tape, and\r\ndish the meat; strain the gravy over it, and send it to table with\r\nred-currant jelly. Unless the joint is very fat, the above is the best\r\nmode of cooking it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3-1/2 to 4 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 4d. to 1s. 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 or 12 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Buck venison, from June to Michaelmas; doe venison, from\r\nNovember to the end of January.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROEBUCK.]\r\n\r\n    THE ROEBUCK.--This is the _Certuscapreolus_, or common roe, and\r\n    is of a reddish-brown colour. It is an inhabitant of Asia, as\r\n    well as of Europe. It has great grace in its movements, and\r\n    stands about two feet seven inches high, and has a length of\r\n    about three feet nine. The extent of its horns is from six to\r\n    eight inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STAG. THE HIND.]\r\n\r\n    THE STAG.--The stag, or hart, is the male of the red deer, and\r\n    the hind is the female. He is much larger than the fallow-deer,\r\n    and his age is indicated by his horns, which are round instead\r\n    of being palmated, like those of the fallow-deer. During the\r\n    first year he has no horns, but a horny excrescence, which is\r\n    short and rough, and covered with a thin hairy skin. The next\r\n    year, the horns are single and straight; and in the third they\r\n    have two antlers, three the fourth, four the fifth, and five the\r\n    sixth year; although this number is not always certain, for\r\n    sometimes they are more, and often less. After the sixth year,\r\n    the antlers do not always increase; and, although in number they\r\n    may amount to six or seven on each side, yet the animal's age is\r\n    then estimated rather by the size of the antlers and the\r\n    thickness of the branch which sustains them, than by their\r\n    variety. Large as these horns seem, however, they are shed every\r\n    year, and their place supplied by new ones. This usually takes\r\n    place in the spring. When the old horns have fallen off, the new\r\n    ones do not make their appearance immediately; but the bones of\r\n    the skull ore seen covered with a transparent periosteum, or\r\n    skin, which enwraps the bones of all animals. After a short\r\n    time, however, the skin begins to swell, and to form a sort of\r\n    tumour. From this, by-and-by, rising from the head, shoot forth\r\n    the antlers from each side; and, in a short time, in proportion\r\n    as the animal is in condition, the entire horns are completed.\r\n    The solidity of the extremities, however, is not perfect until\r\n    the horns have arrived at their full growth. Old stags usually\r\n    shed their horns first, which generally happens towards the\r\n    latter end of February or the beginning of March. Such as are\r\n    between five and six years old shed them about the middle or\r\n    latter end of March; those still younger in the month of April;\r\n    and the youngest of all not till the middle or latter end of\r\n    May. These rules, though generally true, are subject to\r\n    variations; for a severe winter will retard the shedding of the\r\n    horns.--The HIND has no horns, and is less fitted for being\r\n    hunted than the male. She takes the greatest care of her young,\r\n    and secretes them in the most obscure thickets, lest they become\r\n    a prey to their numerous enemies. All the rapacious family of\r\n    the cat kind, with the wolf, the dog, the eagle, and the falcon,\r\n    are continually endeavouring to find her retreat, whilst the\r\n    stag himself is the foe of his own offspring. When she has\r\n    young, therefore, it would seem that the courage of the male is\r\n    transferred to the female, for she defends them with the most\r\n    resolute bravery. If pursued by the hunter, she will fly before\r\n    the hounds for half the day, and then return to her young, whose\r\n    life she has thus preserved at the hazard of her own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELAND (BULL). ELAND (COW).]\r\n\r\n    THE NEW VENISON.--The deer population of our splendid English\r\n    parks was, until a few years since, limited to two species, the\r\n    fallow and the red. But as the fallow-deer itself was an\r\n    acclimated animal, of comparatively recent introduction, it came\r\n    to be a question why might not the proprietor of any deer-park\r\n    in England have the luxury of at least half a dozen species of\r\n    deer and antelopes, to adorn the hills, dales, ferny brakes, and\r\n    rich pastures of his domain? The temperate regions of the whole\r\n    world might be made to yield specimens of the noble ruminant,\r\n    valuable either for their individual beauty, or for their\r\n    availability to gastronomic purposes.\r\n\r\n    During the last four or live years a few spirited English\r\n    noblemen have made the experiment of breeding foreign deer in\r\n    their parks, and have obtained such a decided success, that it\r\n    may be hoped their example will induce others to follow in a\r\n    course which will eventually give to England's rural scenery a\r\n    new element of beauty, and to English tables a fresh viand of\r\n    the choicest character.\r\n\r\n    A practical solution of this interesting question was made by\r\n    Viscount Hill, at Hawkestone Park, Salop, in January, 1809. On\r\n    that occasion a magnificent eland, an acclimated scion of the\r\n    species whose native home is the South African wilderness, was\r\n    killed for the table. The noble beast was thus described:--\"He\r\n    weighed 1,176 lbs. as he dropped; huge as a short-horn, but with\r\n    bone not half the size; active as a deer, stately in all his\r\n    paces, perfect in form, bright in colour, with a vast dewlap,\r\n    and strong sculptured horn. This eland in his lifetime strode\r\n    majestic on the hill-side, where he dwelt with his mates and\r\n    their progeny, all English-born, like himself.\" Three pairs of\r\n    the same species of deer were left to roam at large on the\r\n    picturesque elopes throughout the day, and to return to their\r\n    home at pleasure. \"Here, during winter, they are assisted with\r\n    roots and hay, but in summer they have nothing but the pasture\r\n    of the park; so that, in point of expense, they cost no more\r\n    than cattle of the best description.\" Travellers and sportsmen\r\n    say that the male eland is unapproached in the quality of his\r\n    flesh by any ruminant in South Africa; that it grows to an\r\n    enormous size, and lays on fat with as great facility as a true\r\n    short-horn; while in texture and flavour it is infinitely\r\n    superior. The lean is remarkably fine, the fat firm and\r\n    delicate. It was tried in every fashion,--braised brisket,\r\n    roasted ribs, broiled steaks, filet sauté, boiled aitchbone,\r\n    &c.,--and in all, gave evidence of the fact, that a new meat of\r\n    surpassing value had been added to the products of the English\r\n    park.\r\n\r\n    When we hear such a gratifying account of the eland, it is\r\n    pleasing to record that Lord Hastings has a herd of the Canadian\r\n    wapiti, a herd of Indian nylghaus, and another of the small\r\n    Indian hog-deer; that the Earl of Ducie has been successful in\r\n    breeding the magnificent Persian deer. The eland was first\r\n    acclimated in England by the late Earl of Derby, between the\r\n    years 1835-1851, at his menagerie at Knowsley. On his death, in\r\n    1851, he bequeathed to the Zoological Society his breed of\r\n    elands, consisting of two males and three females. Here the\r\n    animals have been treated with the greatest success, and from\r\n    the year 1853 to the present time, the females have regularly\r\n    reproduced, without the loss of a single calf.\r\n\r\nROAST WIDGEON.\r\n\r\n1052. INGREDIENTS.--Widgeons, a little flour, butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--These are trussed in the same manner as wild duck, No. 1022,\r\nbut must not be kept so long before they are dressed. Put them down to a\r\nbrisk fire; flour, and baste them continually with butter, and, when\r\nbrowned and nicely frothed, send them to table hot and quickly. Serve\r\nwith brown gravy, or orange gravy, No. 488, and a cut lemon.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour; if liked well done, 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. each; but seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--2 for a dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to February.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST WOODCOCK.]\r\n\r\nROAST WOODCOCK.\r\n\r\n1053. INGREDIENTS.--Woodcocks; butter, flour, toast.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Woodcocks should not be drawn, as the trails are, by epicures,\r\nconsidered a great delicacy. Pluck, and wipe them well outside; truss\r\nthem with the legs close to the body, and the feet pressing upon the\r\nthighs; skin the neck and head, and bring the beak round under the wing.\r\nPlace some slices of toast in the dripping-pan to catch the trails,\r\nallowing a piece of toast for each bird. Roast before a clear fire from\r\n15 to 25 minutes; keep them well basted, and flour and froth them\r\nnicely. When done, dish the pieces of toast with the birds upon them,\r\nand pour round a very little gravy; send some more to table in a tureen.\r\nThese are most delicious birds when well cooked, but they should not be\r\nkept too long: when the feathers drop, or easily come out, they are fit\r\nfor table.--See coloured plate, I 1.\r\n\r\n_Time_.---When liked underdone, 15 to 20 minutes; if liked well done,\r\nallow an extra 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_.--Seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--2 for a dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to February.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WOODCOCK.]\r\n\r\n    THE WOODCOCK.--This bird being migratory in its habits, has,\r\n    consequently, no settled habitation; it cannot be considered as\r\n    the property of any one, and is, therefore, not game by law. It\r\n    breeds in high northern latitudes, and the time of its\r\n    appearance and disappearance in Sweden coincides exactly with\r\n    that of its arrival in and return from Great Britain. On the\r\n    coast of Suffolk its vernal and autumnal visits have been\r\n    accurately observed. In the first week of October it makes its\r\n    appearance in small numbers, but in November and December it\r\n    appears in larger numbers, and always after sunset, and most\r\n    gregariously. In the same manner as woodcocks take their leave\r\n    of us, they quit France, Germany, and Italy, making the northern\r\n    and colder climates their summer rendezvous. They visit Burgundy\r\n    in the latter part of October, but continue there only a few\r\n    weeks, the country being hard, and unable to supply them with\r\n    such sustenance as they require. In the winter, they are found\r\n    as far south as Smyrna and Aleppo, and, during the same season,\r\n    in Barbary, where the Africans name them \"the ass of the\r\n    partridge.\" It has been asserted that they have been seen as far\r\n    south as Egypt, which is the most remote region to which they\r\n    can be traced on that side of the eastern world; on the other\r\n    side, they are common in Japan. Those which resort to the\r\n    countries of the Levant are supposed to come from the mountains\r\n    of Armenia, or the deserts of Tartary or Siberia. The flesh of\r\n    the woodcock is held in high estimation; hence the bird is\r\n    eagerly sought after by the sportsman.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAME CARVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKCOCK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACKCOCK.]\r\n\r\n1054. Skilful carving of game undoubtedly adds to the pleasure of the\r\nguests at a dinner-table; for game seems pre-eminently to be composed of\r\nsuch delicate limbs and tender flesh that an inapt practitioner appears\r\nto more disadvantage when mauling these pretty and favourite dishes,\r\nthan larger and more robust _pièces de résistance_. As described at\r\nrecipe No. 1019, this bird is variously served with or without the head\r\non; and although we do not personally object to the appearance of the\r\nhead as shown in the woodcut, yet it seems to be more in vogue to serve\r\nit without. The carving is not difficult, but should be elegantly and\r\ndeftly done. Slices from the breast, cut in the direction of the dotted\r\nline from 2 to 1, should be taken off, the merrythought displaced and\r\nthe leg and wing removed by running the knife along from 3 to 4, and\r\nfollowing the directions given under the head of boiled fowl, No. 1000,\r\nreserving the thigh, which is considered a great delicacy, for the most\r\nhonoured guests, some of whom may also esteem the brains of this bird.\r\n\r\nWILD DUCK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD DUCK.]\r\n\r\n1055. As game is almost universally served as a dainty, and not as a\r\ndish to stand the assaults of an altogether fresh appetite, these dishes\r\nare not usually cut up entirely, but only those parts are served of\r\neach, which are considered the best-flavoured and the primest. Of\r\nwild-fowl, the breast alone is considered by epicures worth eating, and\r\nslices are cut from this, in the direction indicated by the lines, from\r\n1 to 2; if necessary, the leg and wing can be taken off by passing the\r\nknife from 3 to 4, and by generally following the directions described\r\nfor carving boiled fowl, No. 1000.\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST HARE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST HARE.]\r\n\r\n1056. The \"Grand Carver\" of olden times, a functionary of no ordinary\r\ndignity, was pleased when he had a hare to manipulate, for his skill and\r\ngrace had an opportunity of display. _Diners à la Russe_ may possibly,\r\nerewhile, save modern gentlemen the necessity of learning the art which\r\nwas in auld lang syne one of the necessary accomplishments of the\r\nyouthful squire; but, until side-tables become universal, or till we see\r\nthe office of \"grand carver\" once more instituted, it will be well for\r\nall to learn how to assist at the carving of this dish, which, if not\r\nthe most elegant in appearance, is a very general favourite. The hare,\r\nhaving its head to the left, as shown in the woodcut, should be first\r\nserved by cutting slices from each side of the backbone, in the\r\ndirection of the lines from 3 to 4. After these prime parts are disposed\r\nof, the leg should next be disengaged by cutting round the line\r\nindicated by the figures 5 to 6. The shoulders will then be taken off by\r\npassing the knife round from 7 to 8. The back of the hare should now be\r\ndivided by cutting quite through its spine, as shown by the line 1 to 2,\r\ntaking care to feel with the point of the knife for a joint where the\r\nback may be readily penetrated. It is the usual plan not to serve any\r\nbone in helping hare; and thus the flesh should be sliced from the legs\r\nand placed alone on the plate. In large establishments, and where\r\nmen-cooks are kept, it is often the case that the backbone of the hare,\r\nespecially in old animals, is taken out, and then the process of carving\r\nis, of course, considerably facilitated. A great point to be remembered\r\nin connection with carving hare is, that plenty of gravy should\r\naccompany each helping; otherwise this dish, which is naturally dry,\r\nwill lose half its flavour, and so become a failure. Stuffing is also\r\nserved with it; and the ears, which should be nicely crisp, and the\r\nbrains of the hare, are esteemed as delicacies by many connoisseurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTRIDGES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST PARTRIDGES.]\r\n\r\n1057. There are several ways of carving this most familiar game bird.\r\nThe more usual and summary mode is to carry the knife sharply along the\r\ntop of the breastbone of the bird, and cut it quite through, thus\r\ndividing it into two precisely equal and similar parts, in the same\r\nmanner as carving a pigeon, No. 1003. Another plan is to cut it into\r\nthree pieces; viz., by severing a small wing and leg on either side from\r\nthe body, by following the line 1 to 2 in the upper woodcut; thus making\r\n2 helpings, when the breast will remain for a third plate. The most\r\nelegant manner is that of thrusting back the body from the legs, and\r\nthen cutting through the breast in the direction shown by the line 1 to\r\n2: this plan will give 4 or more small helpings. A little bread-sauce\r\nshould be served to each guest.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUSE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1058. GROUSE may be carved in the way first described in carving\r\npartridge. The backbone of the grouse is highly esteemed by many, and\r\nthis part of many game birds is considered the finest flavoured.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHEASANT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAST PHEASANT.]\r\n\r\n1059. Fixing the fork in the breast, let the carver cut slices from it\r\nin the direction of the lines from 2 to 1: these are the prime pieces.\r\nIf there be more guests to satisfy than these slices will serve, then\r\nlet the legs and wings be disengaged in the same manner as described in\r\ncarving boiled fowl, No. 1000, the point where the wing joins the\r\nneckbone being carefully found. The merrythought will come off in the\r\nsame way as that of a fowl. The most valued parts are the same as those\r\nwhich are most considered in a fowl.\r\n\r\n\r\nSNIPE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNIPE.]\r\n\r\n1060. One of these small but delicious birds may be given, whole, to a\r\ngentleman; but, in helping a lady, it will be better to cut them quite\r\nthrough the centre, from 1 to 2, completely dividing them into equal and\r\nlike portions, and put only one half on the plate.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAUNCH OF VENISON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAUNCH OF VENISON.]\r\n\r\n1061. Here is a grand dish for a knight of the carving-knife to exercise\r\nhis skill upon, and, what will be pleasant for many to know, there is\r\nbut little difficulty in the performance. An incision being made\r\ncompletely down to the bone, in the direction of the line 1 to 2, the\r\ngravy will then be able easily to flow; when slices, not too thick,\r\nshould be cut along the haunch, as indicated by the line 4 to 3; that\r\nend of the joint marked 3 having been turned towards the carver, so that\r\nhe may have a more complete command over the joint. Although some\r\nepicures affect to believe that some parts of the haunch are superior to\r\nothers, yet we doubt if there is any difference between the slices cut\r\nabove and below the line. It should be borne in mind to serve each guest\r\nwith a portion of fat; and the most expeditious carver will be the best\r\ncarver, as, like mutton, venison soon begins to chill, when it loses\r\nmuch of its charm.\r\n\r\nWOODCOCK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOODCOCK.]\r\n\r\n1062. This bird, like a partridge, may be carved by cutting it exactly\r\ninto two like portions, or made into three helpings, as described in\r\ncarving partridge (No. 1057). The backbone is considered the tit-bit of\r\na woodcock, and by many the thigh is also thought a great delicacy. This\r\nbird is served in the manner advised by Brillat Savarin, in connection\r\nwith the pheasant, viz., on toast which has received its drippings\r\nwhilst roasting; and a piece of this toast should invariably accompany\r\neach plate.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDRAIL.\r\n\r\n1063. LANDRAIL, being trussed like Snipe, with the exception of its\r\nbeing drawn, may be carved in the same manner.--See No. 1060.\r\n\r\n\r\nPTARMIGAN.\r\n\r\n1064. PTARMIGAN, being of much the same size, and trussed in the same\r\nmanner, as the red-bird, may be carved in the manner described in\r\nPartridge and Grouse carving, Nos. 1057 and 1058.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUAILS.\r\n\r\n1065. QUAILS, being trussed and served like Woodcock, may be similarly\r\ncarved.--See No. 1062.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLOVERS.\r\n\r\n1066.

If we had to deal with yellow and blue only, the eye would\r\neasily distinguish the one from the other; but when the two are blended,\r\nand form green, we cannot tell where the blue ends and the yellow\r\nbegins. And so it is in the animal and vegetable kingdoms. If our powers\r\nof observation were limited to the highest orders of animals and plants,\r\nif there were only mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, and insects in the\r\none, and trees, shrubs, and herbs in the other, we should then be able\r\nwith facility to define the bounds of the two kingdoms; but as we\r\ndescend the scale of each, and arrive at the lowest forms of animals and\r\nplants, we there meet with bodies of the simplest structure, sometimes a\r\nmere cell, whose organization, modes of development and reproduction,\r\nare so anomalous, and partake so much of the character of both, that we\r\ncannot distinguish whether they are plants or whether they are animals.\"\r\n\r\n1070. WHILST IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE where the animal begins and\r\nthe vegetable ends, it is as difficult to account for many of the\r\nsingularities by which numbers of plants are characterized. This,\r\nhowever, can hardly be regarded as a matter of surprise, when we\r\nrecollect that, so far as it is at present known, the vegetable kingdom\r\nis composed of upwards of 92,000 species of plants. Of this amazing\r\nnumber the lichens and the mosses are of the simplest and hardiest\r\nkinds. These, indeed, may be considered as the very creators of the\r\nsoil: they thrive in the coldest and most sterile regions, many of them\r\ncommencing the operations of nature in the growth of vegetables on the\r\nbarest rocks, and receiving no other nourishment than such as may be\r\nsupplied to them by the simple elements of air and rain. When they have\r\nexhausted their period in such situations as have been assigned them,\r\nthey pass into a state of decay, and become changed into a very fine\r\nmould, which, in the active spontaneity of nature, immediately begins to\r\nproduce other species, which in their turn become food for various\r\nmosses, and also rot. This process of growth and decay, being, from time\r\nto time, continued, by-and-by forms a soil sufficient for the\r\nmaintenance of larger plants, which also die and decay, and so increase\r\nthe soil, until it becomes deep enough to sustain an oak, or even the\r\nweight of a tropical forest. To create soil amongst rocks, however, must\r\nnot be considered as the only end of the lichen; different kinds of it\r\nminister to the elegant arts, in the form of beautiful dyes; thus the\r\n_lichen rocella_ is used to communicate to silk and wool, various shades\r\nof purple and crimson, which greatly enhance the value of these\r\nmaterials. This species is chiefly imported from the Canary Islands,\r\nand, when scarce, as an article of commerce has brought as much as £1000\r\nper ton.\r\n\r\n1071. IN THE VICINITY OF LICHENS, THE MUSCI, OR MOSSES, are generally to\r\nbe found. Indeed, wherever vegetation can be sustained, there they are,\r\naffording protection to the roots and seeds of more delicate vegetables,\r\nand, by their spongy texture, retaining a moisture which preserves other\r\nplants from the withering drought of summer. But even in winter we find\r\nthem enlivening, by their verdure, the cold bosom of Nature. We see them\r\nabounding in our pastures and our woods, attaching themselves to the\r\nliving, and still more abundantly to the dead, trunks and branches of\r\ntrees. In marshy places they also abound, and become the medium of their\r\nconversion into fruitful fields. This is exemplified by the manner in\r\nwhich peat-mosses are formed: on the surface of these we find them in a\r\nstate of great life and vigour; immediately below we discover them, more\r\nor less, in a state of decomposition; and, still deeper, we find their\r\nstems and branches consolidated into a light brown peat. Thus are\r\nextensive tracts formed, ultimately to be brought into a state of\r\ncultivation, and rendered subservient to the wants of man.\r\n\r\n1072. WHEN NATURE HAS FOUND A SOIL, her next care is to perfect the\r\ngrowth of her seeds, and then to disperse them. Whilst the seed remains\r\nconfined in its capsule, it cannot answer its purpose; hence, when it is\r\nsufficiently ripe, the pericardium opens, and lets it out. What must\r\nstrike every observer with surprise is, how nuts and shells, which we\r\ncan hardly crack with our teeth, or even with a hammer, will divide of\r\nthemselves, and make way for the little tender sprout which proceeds\r\nfrom the kernel. There are instances, it is said, such as in the\r\nTouch-me-not (_impatiens_), and the Cuckoo-flower (_cardamine_), in\r\nwhich the seed-vessels, by an elastic jerk at the moment of their\r\nexplosion, cast the seeds to a distance. We are all aware, however, that\r\nmany seeds--those of the most composite flowers, as of the thistle and\r\ndandelion--are endowed with, what have not been inappropriately called,\r\nwings. These consist of a beautiful silk-looking down, by which they are\r\nenabled to float in the air, and to be transported, sometimes, to\r\nconsiderable distances from the parent plant that produced them. The\r\nswelling of this downy tuft within the seed-vessel is the means by which\r\nthe seed is enabled to overcome the resistance of its coats, and to\r\nforce for itself a passage by which it escapes from its little\r\nprison-house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEETON'S Book of HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT\r\nEDITED BY MRS. ISABELLA BEETON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE FREE, FAIR HOMES OF ENGLAND.\"]\r\n\r\n1073. BIRDS, AS WELL AS QUADRUPEDS, are likewise the means of dispersing\r\nthe seeds of plants, and placing them in situations where they\r\nultimately grow. Amongst the latter is the squirrel, which is an\r\nextensive planter of oaks; nay, it may be regarded as having, in some\r\nmeasure, been one of the creators of the British navy. We have read of a\r\ngentleman who was walking one day in some woods belonging to the Duke of\r\nBeaufort, near Troy House, in Monmouthshire, when his attention was\r\narrested by a squirrel, sitting very composedly upon the ground. He\r\nstopped to observe its motions, when, in a short time, the little animal\r\nsuddenly quitted its position, and darted to the top of the tree beneath\r\nwhich it had been sitting. In an instant it returned with an acorn in\r\nits mouth, and with its paws began to burrow in the earth. After digging\r\na small hole, it therein deposited an acorn, which it hastily covered,\r\nand then darted up the tree again. In a moment it was down with another,\r\nwhich it buried in the same manner; and so continued its labour,\r\ngathering and burying, as long as the gentleman had patience to watch\r\nit. This industry in the squirrel is an instinct which directs it to lay\r\nup a store of provision for the winter; and as it is probable that its\r\nmemory is not sufficiently retentive to enable it to recollect all the\r\nspots in which it deposits its acorns, it no doubt makes some slips in\r\nthe course of the season, and loses some of them. These few spring up,\r\nand are, in time, destined to supply the place of the parent tree. Thus\r\nmay the sons of Britain, in some degree, consider themselves to be\r\nindebted to the industry and defective memory of this little animal for\r\nthe production of some of those \"wooden walls\" which have, for\r\ncenturies, been the national pride, and which have so long \"braved the\r\nbattle and the breeze\" on the broad bosom of the great deep, in every\r\nquarter of the civilized globe. As with the squirrel, so with jays and\r\npies, which plant among the grass and moss, horse-beans, and probably\r\nforget where they have secreted them. Mr. White, the naturalist, says,\r\nthat both horse-beans and peas sprang up in his field-walks in the\r\nautumn; and he attributes the sowing of them to birds. Bees, he also\r\nobserves, are much the best setters of cucumbers. If they do not happen\r\nto take kindly to the frames, the best way is to tempt them by a little\r\nhoney put on the male and female bloom. When they are once induced to\r\nhaunt the frames, they set all the fruit, and will hover with impatience\r\nround the lights in a morning till the glasses are opened.\r\n\r\n1074. Some of the acorns planted by the squirrel of Monmouthshire may be\r\nnow in a fair way to become, at the end of some centuries, venerable\r\ntrees; for not the least remarkable quality of oaks is the strong\r\nprinciple of life with which they are endued. In Major Rooke's \"Sketch\r\nof the forest of Sherwood\" we find it stated that, on some timber cut\r\ndown in Berkland and Bilhaugh, letters were found stamped in the bodies\r\nof the trees, denoting the king's reign in which they were marked. The\r\nbark appears to have been cut off, and then the letters to have been cut\r\nin, and the next year's wood to have grown over them without adhering to\r\nwhere the bark had been cut out. The ciphers were found to be of James\r\nI., William and Mary, and one of King John. One of the ciphers of James\r\nwas about one foot within the tree, and one foot from the centre. It was\r\ncut down in 1786. The tree must have been two feet in diameter, or two\r\nyards in circumference, when the mark was cut. A tree of this size is\r\ngenerally estimated at 120 years' growth; which number being subtracted\r\nfrom the middle year of the reign of James, would carry the year back to\r\n1492, which would be about the period of its being planted. The tree\r\nwith the cipher of William and Mary displayed its mark about nine inches\r\nwithin the tree, and three feet three inches from the centre. This tree\r\nwas felled in 1786. The cipher of John was eighteen inches within the\r\ntree, and rather more than a foot from the centre. The middle year of\r\nthe reign of that monarch was 1207. By subtracting from this 120, the\r\nnumber of years requisite for a tree's growth to arrive at the diameter\r\nof two feet, the date of its being planted would seem to have been 1085,\r\nor about twenty years after the Conquest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CELLULAR DEVELOPMENT.]\r\n\r\n1075. Considering the great endurance of these trees, we are necessarily\r\nled to inquire into the means by which they are enabled to arrive at\r\nsuch strength and maturity; and whether it may be considered as a\r\nhumiliation we will not determine, but, with all the ingenious\r\nmechanical contrivances of man, we are still unable to define the limits\r\nof the animal and vegetable kingdoms. \"Plants have been described by\r\nnaturalists, who would determine the limits of the two kingdoms, as\r\norganized living bodies, without volition or locomotion, destitute of a\r\nmouth or intestinal cavity, which, when detached from their place of\r\ngrowth, die, and, in decay, ferment, but do not putrefy, and which, on\r\nbeing subjected to analysis, furnish an excess of carbon and no\r\nnitrogen. The powers of chemistry, and of the microscope, however,\r\ninstead of confirming these views, tend more and more to show that a\r\nstill closer affinity exists between plants and animals; for it is now\r\nascertained that nitrogen, which was believed to be present only in\r\nanimals, enters largely into the composition of plants also. When the\r\nmicroscope is brought to aid our powers of observation, we find that\r\nthere are organized bodies belonging to the vegetable kingdom which\r\npossess very evident powers of locomotion, and which change about in so\r\nvery remarkable a manner, that no other cause than that of volition can\r\nbe assigned to it.\" Thus it would seem that, in this particular at\r\nleast, some vegetables bear a very close resemblance to animal life; and\r\nwhen we consider the manner in which they are supplied with nourishment,\r\nand perform the functions of their existence, the resemblance would seem\r\nstill closer. If, for example, we take a thin transverse slice of the\r\nstem of any plant, or a slice cut across its stem, and immerse it in a\r\nlittle pure water, and place it under a microscope, we will find that it\r\nconsists principally of cells, more or less regular, and resembling\r\nthose of a honeycomb or a network of cobweb. The size of these varies in\r\ndifferent plants, as it does in different parts of the same plant, and\r\nthey are sometimes so minute as to require a million to cover a square\r\ninch of surface. This singular structure, besides containing water and\r\nair, is the repository or storehouse of various secretions. Through it,\r\nthe sap, when produced, is diffused sideways through the plant, and by\r\nit numerous changes are effected in the juices which fill its cells. The\r\nforms of the cells are various; they are also subject to various\r\ntransformations. Sometimes a number of cylindrical cells are laid end to\r\nend, and, by the absorption of the transverse partitions, form a\r\ncontinuous tube, as in the sap-vessels of plants, or in muscular and\r\nnervous fibre; and when cells are thus woven together, they are called\r\ncellular tissue, which, in the human body, forms a fine net-like\r\nmembrane, enveloping or connecting most of its structures. In pulpy\r\nfruits, the cells may be easily separated one from the other; and within\r\nthe cells are smaller cells, commonly known as pulp. Among the\r\ncell-contents of some plants are beautiful crystals, called _raphides_.\r\nThe term is derived from [Greek: rhaphis] a _needle_, on account of the\r\nresemblance of the crystal to a needle. They are composed of the\r\nphosphate and oxalate of lime; but there is great difference of opinion\r\nas to their use in the economy of the plant, and one of the French\r\nphilosophers endeavoured to prove that crystals are the possible\r\ntransition of the inorganic to organic matter. The differences, however,\r\nbetween the highest form of crystal and the lowest form of organic life\r\nknown, viz., a simple reproductive cell, are so manifold and striking,\r\nthat the attempt to make crystals the bridge over which inorganic matter\r\npasses into organic, is almost totally regarded as futile. In a layer of\r\nan onion, a fig, a section of garden rhubarb, in some species of aloe,\r\nin the bark of many trees, and in portions of the cuticle of the\r\nmedicinal squill, bundles of these needle-shaped crystals are to be\r\nfound. Some of them are as large as 1-40th of an inch, others are as\r\nsmall as the 1-1000th. They are found in all parts of the plant,--in the\r\nstem, bark, leaves, stipules, petals, fruit, roots, and even in the\r\npollen, with some few exceptions, and they are always situated in the\r\ninterior of cells. Some plants, as many of the _cactus_ tribe, are made\r\nup almost entirely of these needle-crystals; in some instances, every\r\ncell of the cuticle contains a stellate mass of crystals; in others, the\r\nwhole interior is full of them, rendering the plant so exceedingly\r\nbrittle, that the least touch will occasion a fracture; so much so, that\r\nsome specimens of _Cactus senilis_, said to be a thousand years old,\r\nwhich were sent a few years since to Kew, from South America, were\r\nobliged to be packed in cotton, with all the care of the most delicate\r\njewellery, to preserve them during transport.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILICEOUS CUTICLE FROM UNDER-SIDE OF LEAF OF DEUTZIA\r\nSCABRA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILICEOUS CUTICLE OF GRASS.]\r\n\r\n1076. Besides the cellular tissue, there is what is called a vascular\r\nsystem, which consists of another set of small vessels. If, for example,\r\nwe, early in the spring, cut a branch transversely, we will perceive the\r\nsap oozing out from numerous points over the whole of the divided\r\nsurface, except on that part occupied by the pith and the bark; and if a\r\ntwig, on which the leaves are already unfolded, be cut from the tree,\r\nand placed with its cut end in a watery solution of Brazil-wood, the\r\ncolouring matter will be found to ascend into the leaves and to the top\r\nof the twig. In both these cases, a close examination with a powerful\r\nmicroscope, will discover the sap perspiring from the divided portion of\r\nthe stem, and the colouring matter rising through real tubes to the top\r\nof the twig: these are the sap or conducting vessels of the plant. If,\r\nhowever, we examine a transverse section of the vine, or of any other\r\ntree, at a later period of the season, we find that the wood is\r\napparently dry, whilst the bark, particularly that part next the wood,\r\nis swelled with fluid. This is contained in vessels of a different kind\r\nfrom those in which the sap rises. They are found in the _bark_ only in\r\ntrees, and may be called returning vessels, from their carrying the sap\r\ndownwards after its preparation in the leaf. It is believed that the\r\npassage of the sap in plants is conducted in a manner precisely similar\r\nto that of the blood in man, from the regular contraction and expansion\r\nof the vessels; but, on account of their extreme minuteness, it is\r\nalmost an impossibility to be certain upon this point. Numerous\r\nobservations made with the microscope show that their diameter seldom\r\nexceeds a 290th part of a line, or a 3,000th part of an inch.\r\nLeuwenhoeck reckoned 20,000 vessels in a morsel of oak about one\r\nnineteenth of an inch square.\r\n\r\n1077. In the vascular system of a plant, we at once see the great\r\nanalogy which it bears to the veins and arteries in the human system;\r\nbut neither it, nor the cellular tissue combined, is all that is\r\nrequired to perfect the production of a vegetable. There is, besides, a\r\ntracheal system, which is composed of very minute elastic spiral tubes,\r\ndesigned for the purpose of conveying air both to and from the plant.\r\nThere are also fibres, which consist of collections of these cells and\r\nvessels closely united together. These form the root and the stem. If we\r\nattempt to cut them transversely, we meet with difficulty, because we\r\nhave to force our way across the tubes, and break them; but if we slit\r\nthe wood lengthwise, the vessels are separated without breaking. The\r\nlayers of wood, which appear in the stem or branch of a tree cut\r\ntransversely, consist of different zones of fibres, each the produce of\r\none year's growth, and separated by a coat of cellular tissue, without\r\nwhich they could not be well distinguished. Besides all these, there is\r\nthe cuticle, which extends over every part of the plant, and covers the\r\nbark with three distinct coats. The _liber_, or inner bark, is said to\r\nbe formed of hollow tubes, which convey the sap downwards to increase\r\nthe solid diameter of the tree.\r\n\r\n1078. THE ROOT AND THE STEM NOW DEMAND A SLIGHT NOTICE. The former is\r\ndesigned, not only to support the plant by fixing it in the soil, but\r\nalso to fulfil the functions of a channel for the conveyance of\r\nnourishment: it is therefore furnished with pores, or spongioles, as\r\nthey are called, from their resemblance to a sponge, to suck up whatever\r\ncomes within its reach. It is found in a variety of forms, and hence its\r\nadaptation to a great diversity of soils and circumstances. We have\r\nheard of a willow-tree being dug up and its head planted where its roots\r\nwere, and these suffered to spread out in the air like naked branches.\r\nIn course of time, the roots became branches, and the branches roots, or\r\nrather, roots rose from the branches beneath the ground, and branches\r\nshot from the roots above. Some roots last one year, others two, and\r\nothers, like the shrubs and trees which they produce, have an indefinite\r\nperiod of existence; but they all consist of a collection of fibres,\r\ncomposed of vascular and cellular tissue, without tracheae, or\r\nbreathing-vessels. The stem is the grand distributor of the nourishment\r\ntaken up by the roots, to the several parts of the plant. The seat of\r\nits vitality is said to be in the point or spot called the neck, which\r\nseparates the stem from the root. If the root of a young plant be cut\r\noff, it will shoot out afresh; if even the stem be taken away, it will\r\nbe renewed; but if this part be injured, the plant will assuredly die.\r\n\r\n1079. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PLAN OF THIS WORK, special notices of\r\nculinary vegetables will accompany the various recipes in which they are\r\nspoken of; but here we cannot resist the opportunity of declaring it as\r\nour conviction, that he or she who introduces a useful or an ornamental\r\nplant into our island, ought justly to be considered, to a large extent,\r\na benefactor to the country. No one can calculate the benefits which may\r\nspring from this very vegetable, after its qualities have become\r\nthoroughly known. If viewed in no other light, it is pleasing to\r\nconsider it as bestowing upon us a share of the blessings of other\r\nclimates, and enabling us to participate in the luxury which a more\r\ngenial sun has produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED ARTICHOKES.\r\n\r\n1080.

Cut off the\r\nstems and put them into _boiling_ water, to which have been added salt\r\nand soda in the above proportion. Keep the saucepan uncovered, and let\r\nthem boil quickly until tender; ascertain when they are done by\r\nthrusting a fork in them, or by trying if the leaves can be easily\r\nremoved. Take them out, let them drain for a minute or two, and serve in\r\na napkin, or with a little white sauce poured over. A tureen of melted\r\nbutter should accompany them. This vegetable, unlike any other, is\r\nconsidered better for being gathered two or three days; but they must be\r\nwell soaked and washed previous to dressing.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 to 25 minutes, after the water boils.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--a dish of 5 or 6 for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to the beginning of September.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARDOON ARTICHOKE.]\r\n\r\n    THE COMPOSITAE, OR COMPOSITE FLOWERS.--This family is so\r\n    extensive, as to contain nearly a twelfth part of the whole of\r\n    the vegetable kingdom.

Let them boil gently until tender; take\r\nthem up, drain them, and serve them in a napkin, or plain, whichever\r\nmode is preferred; send to table with them a tureen of melted butter or\r\ncream sauce, a little of which may be poured over the artichokes when\r\nthey are _not_ served in a napkin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES.]\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 20 minutes after the water boils.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--10 for a dish for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to June.\r\n\r\n    USES OF THE JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE.--This being a tuberous-rooted\r\n    plant, with leafy stems from four to six feet high, it is\r\n    alleged that its tops will afford as much fodder per acre as a\r\n    crop of oats, or more, and its roots half as many tubers as an\r\n    ordinary crop of potatoes. The tubers, being abundant in the\r\n    market-gardens, are to be had at little more than the price of\r\n    potatoes. The fibres of the stems may be separated by\r\n    maceration, and manufactured into cordage or cloth; and this is\r\n    said to be done in some parts of the north and west of France,\r\n    as about Hagenau, where this plant, on the poor sandy soils, is\r\n    an object of field culture.\r\n\r\nMASHED JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES.\r\n\r\n1085. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1 gallon of water allow 1 oz. of salt; 15 or\r\n16 artichokes, 1 oz. butter, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the artichokes as in the preceding recipe until tender;\r\ndrain and press the water from them, and beat them up with a fork. When\r\nthoroughly mashed and free from lumps, put them into a saucepan with the\r\nbutter and a seasoning of white pepper and salt; keep stirring over the\r\nfire until the artichokes are quite hot, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 20 minutes. _Average cost_, 2d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to June.\r\n\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM ARTICHOKES WITH WHITE SAUCE.\r\n\r\n(Entremets, or to be served with the Second Course as a Side-dish.)\r\n\r\n1086. INGREDIENTS.--12 to 15 artichokes, 12 to 15 Brussels sprouts, 1/2\r\npint of white sauce, No. 538.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel and cut the artichokes in the shape of a pear; cut a piece\r\noff the bottom of each, that they may stand upright in the dish, and\r\nboil them in salt and water until tender. Have ready 1/2 pint of white\r\nsauce, made by recipe No. 538; dish the artichokes, pour over them the\r\nsauce, and place between each a fine Brussels sprout: these should be\r\nboiled separately, and not with the artichokes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 20 minutes. _Average cost_, 2d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to June.\r\n\r\n    THE JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE.--This plant is well known, being, for\r\n    its tubers, cultivated not only as a garden vegetable, but also\r\n    as an agricultural crop. By many it is much esteemed as an\r\n    esculent, when cooked in various ways; and the domesticated\r\n    animals eat both the fresh foliage, and the tubers with great\r\n    relish. By some, they are not only considered nourishing, but\r\n    even fattening.\r\n\r\nBOILED ASPARAGUS.\r\n\r\n1087. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt; asparagus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASPARAGUS ON TOAST. ASPARAGUS TONGS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Asparagus should be dressed as soon as possible after it is\r\ncut, although it may be kept for a day or two by putting the stalks into\r\ncold water; yet, to be good, like every other vegetable, it cannot be\r\ncooked too fresh. Scrape the white part of the stems, _beginning_ from\r\nthe _head_, and throw them into cold water; then tie them into bundles\r\nof about 20 each, keeping the heads all one way, and cut the stalks\r\nevenly, that they may all be the same length; put them into _boiling_\r\nwater, with salt in the above proportion; keep them boiling quickly\r\nuntil tender, with the saucepan uncovered. When the asparagus is done,\r\ndish it upon toast, which should be dipped in the water it was cooked\r\nin, and leave the white ends outwards each war, with the points meeting\r\nin the middle. Serve with a tureen of melted butter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 to 18 minutes after the water boils.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 2s. 6d. the 100 heads.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow about 50 heads for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--May be had, forced, from January but cheapest in May,\r\nJune, and July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASPARAGUS.]\r\n\r\n    ASPARAGUS.--This plant belongs to the variously-featured family\r\n    of the order _Liliaceae_, which, in the temperate regions of\r\n    both hemispheres, are most abundant, and, between the tropics,\r\n    gigantic in size and arborescent in form. Asparagus is a native\r\n    of Great Britain, and is found on various parts of the seacoast,\r\n    and in the fens of Lincolnshire. At Kynarve Cove, in Cornwall,\r\n    there is an island called \"Asparagus Island,\" from the abundance\r\n    in which it is there found. The uses to which the young shoots\r\n    are applied, and the manure in which they are cultivated in\r\n    order to bring them to the highest state of excellence, have\r\n    been a study with many kitchen-gardeners.\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS PEAS.\r\n\r\n(Entremets, or to be served as a Side-dish with the Second Course.)\r\n\r\n1088. INGREDIENTS.--100 heads of asparagus, 2 oz. of butter, a small\r\nbunch of parsley, 2 or 3 green onions, flour, 1 lump of sugar, the yolks\r\nof 2 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Carefully scrape the asparagus, cut it into pieces of an equal\r\nsize, avoiding that which is in the least hard or tough, and throw them\r\ninto cold water. Then boil the asparagus in salt and water until\r\nthree-parts done; take it out, drain, and place it on a cloth to dry the\r\nmoisture away from it. Put it into a stewpan with the butter, parsley,\r\nand onions, and shake over a brisk fire for 10 minutes. Dredge in a\r\nlittle flour, add the sugar, and moisten with boiling water. When boiled\r\na short time and reduced, take out the parsley and onions, thicken with\r\nthe yolks of 2 eggs beaten with the cream; add a seasoning of salt, and,\r\nwhen the whole is on the point of simmering, serve. Make the sauce\r\nsufficiently thick to adhere to the vegetable.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d. a pint.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in May, June, and July.\r\n\r\n    MEDICINAL USES OF ASPARAGUS.--This plant not only acts as a\r\n    wholesome and nutritious vegetable, but also as a diuretic,\r\n    aperient, and deobstruent. The chemical analysis of its juice\r\n    discovers its composition to be a peculiar crystallizable\r\n    principle, called asparagin, albumen, mannite, malic acid, and\r\n    some salts. Thours says, the cellular tissue contains a\r\n    substance similar to sage. The berries are capable of undergoing\r\n    vinous fermentation, and affording alcohol by distillation. In\r\n    their unripe state they possess the same properties as the\r\n    roots, and probably in a much higher degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS PUDDING.\r\n\r\n(A delicious Dish, to be served with the Second Course.)\r\n\r\n1089. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of asparagus peas, 4 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls\r\nof flour, 1 tablespoonful of _very finely_ minced ham, 1 oz. of butter,\r\npepper and salt to taste, milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut up the nice green tender parts of asparagus, about the size\r\nof peas; put them into a basin with the eggs, which should be well\r\nbeaten, and the flour, ham, butter, pepper, and salt. Mix all these\r\ningredients well together, and moisten with sufficient milk to make the\r\npudding of the consistency of thick batter; put it into a pint buttered\r\nmould, tie it down tightly with a floured cloth, place it in _boiling\r\nwater_, and let it boil for 2 hours; turn it out of the mould on to a\r\nhot dish, and pour plain melted butter _round_, but not over, the\r\npudding. Green peas pudding may be made in exactly the same manner,\r\nsubstituting peas for the asparagus.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d. per pint.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in May, June, and July.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED FRENCH BEANS.\r\n\r\n1090. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt, a very small piece of soda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scarlet Runner.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--This vegetable should always be eaten young, as, when allowed\r\nto grow too long, it tastes stringy and tough when cooked. Cut off the\r\nheads and tails, and a thin strip on each side of the beans, to remove\r\nthe strings. Then divide each bean into 4 or 6 pieces, according to\r\nsize, cutting them lengthways in a slanting direction, and, as they are\r\ncut, put them into cold water, with a small quantity of salt dissolved\r\nin it. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, with salt and soda in the\r\nabove proportion; put in the beans, keep them boiling quickly, with the\r\nlid uncovered, and be careful that they do not get smoked. When tender,\r\nwhich may be ascertained by their sinking to the bottom of the saucepan,\r\ntake them up, throw them into a colander; and when drained, dish and\r\nserve with plain melted butter. When very young, beans are sometimes\r\nserved whole: when they are thus dressed, their colour and flavour are\r\nmuch better preserved; but the more general way of dressing them is to\r\ncut them into thin strips.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Very young beans, 10 to 12 minutes; moderate size, 15 to 20\r\nminutes, after the water boils.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 1s. 4d. a peck; but, when forced, very\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1/2 peck for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the middle of July to the end of September; but may be\r\nhad, forced, from February to the beginning of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH MODE OF COOKING FRENCH BEANS.\r\n\r\n1091. INGREDIENTS.--A quart of French beans, 3 oz. of fresh butter,\r\npepper and salt to taste, the juice of 1/2 lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut and boil the beans by the preceding recipe, and when\r\ntender, put them into a stewpan, and shake over the fire, to dry away\r\nthe moisture from the beans. When quite dry and hot, add the butter,\r\npepper, salt, and lemon-juice; keep moving the stewpan, without using a\r\nspoon, as that would break the beans; and when the butter is melted, and\r\nall is thoroughly hot, serve. If the butter should not mix well, add a\r\ntablespoonful of gravy, and serve very quickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/4 hour to boil the beans; 10 minutes to shake them over\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, about 1s. 4d. a peck.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the middle of July to the end of September.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED BROAD OR WINDSOR BEANS.\r\n\r\n1092. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water, allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt; beans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROAD BEAN.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--This is a favourite vegetable with many persons, but to be\r\nnice, should be young and freshly gathered. After shelling the beans,\r\nput them into _boiling_ water, salted in the above proportion, and let\r\nthem boil rapidly until tender. Drain them well in a colander; dish, and\r\nserve with them separately a tureen of parsley and butter. Boiled bacon\r\nshould always accompany this vegetable, but the beans should be cooked\r\nseparately. It is usually served with the beans laid round, and the\r\nparsley and butter in a tureen. Beans also make an excellent garnish to\r\na ham, and when used for this purpose, if very old, should have their\r\nskins removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Very young beans, 15 minutes; when of a moderate size, 20 to 25\r\nminutes, or longer.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, unshelled, 6d. per peck.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow one peck for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July and August.\r\n\r\n    NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES OF THE BEAN.--The produce of beans in meal\r\n    is, like that of peas, more in proportion to the grain than in\r\n    any of the cereal grasses. A bushel of beans is supposed to\r\n    yield fourteen pounds more of flour than a bushel of oats; and a\r\n    bushel of peas eighteen pounds more, or, according to some,\r\n    twenty pounds. A thousand parts of bean flour were found by Sir\r\n    II. Davy to yield 570 parts of nutritive matter, of which 426\r\n    were mucilage or starch, 103 gluten, and 41 extract, or matter\r\n    rendered insoluble during the process.\r\n\r\nBROAD BEANS A LA POULETTE.\r\n\r\n1093. INGREDIENTS.--2 pints of broad beans, 1/2 pint of stock or broth,\r\na small bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, a small lump of\r\nsugar, the yolk of 1 egg, 1/4 pint of cream, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure some young and freshly-gathered beans, and shell\r\nsufficient to make 2 pints; boil them, as in the preceding recipe, until\r\nnearly done; then drain them and put them into a stewpan, with the\r\nstock, finely-minced herbs, and sugar. Stew the beans until perfectly\r\ntender, and the liquor has dried away a little; then beat up the yolk of\r\nan egg with the cream, add this to the beans, let the whole get\r\nthoroughly hot, and when on the point of simmering, serve. Should the\r\nbeans be very large, the skin should be removed previously to boiling\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the beans, 15 minutes to stew them in the\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, unshelled, 6d. per peck.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July and August.\r\n\r\n    ORIGIN AND VARIETIES OF THE BEAN.--This valuable plant is said\r\n    to be a native of Egypt, but, like other plants which have been\r\n    domesticated, its origin is uncertain. It has been cultivated in\r\n    Europe and Asia from time immemorial, and has been long known in\r\n    Britain. Its varieties may be included under two general\r\n    heads,--the white, or garden beans, and the grey, or field\r\n    beans, of the former, sown in the fields, the mazagan and\r\n    long-pod are almost the only sorts; of the latter, those known\r\n    as the horse-bean, the small or ticks, and the prolific of\r\n    Heligoland, are the principal sorts. New varieties are procured\r\n    in the same manner as in other plants.\r\n\r\nBOILED BEETROOT.\r\n\r\n1094. INGREDIENTS,--Beetroot; boiling water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--When large, young, and juicy, this vegetable makes a very\r\nexcellent addition to winter salads, and may easily be converted into an\r\neconomical and quickly-made pickle. (_See_ No. 369.) Beetroot is more\r\nfrequently served cold than hot: when the latter mode is preferred,\r\nmelted butter should be sent to table with it. It may also be stewed\r\nwith button onions, or boiled and served with roasted onions. Wash the\r\nbeets thoroughly; but do not prick or break the skin before they are\r\ncooked, or they would lose their beautiful colour in boiling. Put them\r\ninto boiling water, and let them boil until tender, keeping them well\r\ncovered. If to be served hot, remove the peel quickly, cut the beetroot\r\ninto thick slices, and send to table melted butter. For salads, pickle,\r\n&c., let the root cool, then peel, and cut it into slices.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Small beetroot, 1-1/2 to 2 hours; large, 2-1/2 to 3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 2d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--May be had at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEETROOT.]\r\n\r\n    BEETROOT.--The geographical distribution of the order Saltworts\r\n    (_Salxolaceae_), to which beetroot belongs, is most common in\r\n    extra-tropical and temperate regions, where they are common\r\n    weeds, frequenting waste places, among rubbish, and on marshes\r\n    by the seashore. In the tropics they are rare. They are\r\n    characterized by the large quantities of mucilage, sugar,\r\n    starch, and alkaline salts which are found in them. Many of them\r\n    are used as potherbs, and some are emetic and vermifuge in their\r\n    medicinal properties. The _root_ of _garden_ or red beet is\r\n    exceedingly wholesome and nutritious, and Dr. Lyon Playfair has\r\n    recommended that a good brown bread may be made by rasping down\r\n    this root with an equal quantity of flour. He says that the\r\n    average quality of flour contains about 12 per cent. of azotized\r\n    principles adapted for the formation of flesh, and the average\r\n    quality of beet contains about 2 per cent. of the same\r\n    materials.\r\n\r\nBOILED BROCOLI.\r\n\r\n1095. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt; brocoli.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILED BROCOLI.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Strip off the dead outside leaves, and the inside ones cut off\r\nlevel with the flower; cut off the stalk close at the bottom, and put\r\nthe brocoli into cold salt and water, with the heads downwards. When\r\nthey have remained in this for about 3/4 hour, and they are _perfectly_\r\nfree from insects, put them into a saucepan of _boiling_ water, salted\r\nin the above proportion, and keep them boiling quickly over a brisk\r\nfire, with the saucepan uncovered. Take them up with a slice the moment\r\nthey are done; drain them well, and serve with a tureen of melted\r\nbutter, a _little_ of which should be poured over the brocoli. If left\r\nin the water after it is done, it will break, its colour will be\r\nspoiled, and its crispness gone.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Small brocoli, 10 to 15 minutes; large one, 20 to 25 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--2 for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to March; plentiful in February and March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROCOLI.]\r\n\r\n    THE KOHL-RABI, OR TURNIP-CABBAGE.--This variety presents a\r\n    singular development, inasmuch as the stem swells out like a\r\n    large turnip on the surface of the ground, the leaves shooting\r\n    from it all round, and the top being surmounted by a cluster of\r\n    leaves issuing from it. Although not generally grown as a garden\r\n    vegetable, if used when young and tender, it is wholesome,\r\n    nutritious, and very palatable.\r\n\r\nBOILED BRUSSELS SPROUTS.\r\n\r\n1096. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt; a _very small_ piece of soda.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clean the sprouts from insects, nicely wash them, and pick off\r\nany dead or discoloured leaves from the outsides; put them into a\r\nsaucepan of _boiling_ water, with salt and soda in the above proportion;\r\nkeep the pan uncovered, and let them boil quickly over a brisk fire\r\nuntil tender; drain, dish, and serve with a tureen of melted butter, or\r\nwith a maître d'hôtel sauce poured over them. Another mode of serving\r\nis, when they are dished, to stir in about 1-1/2 oz. of butter and a\r\nseasoning of pepper and salt. They must, however, be sent to table very\r\nquickly, as, being so very small, this vegetable soon cools. Where the\r\ncook is very expeditious, this vegetable, when cooked, may be arranged\r\non the dish in the form of a pineapple, and, so served, has a very\r\npretty appearance.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 9 to 12 minutes after the water boils.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 4d. per peck.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow between 40 and 50 for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n    SAVOYS AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS.--When the Green Kale, or Borecole,\r\n    has been advanced a step further in the path of improvement, it\r\n    assumes the headed or hearting character, with blistered leaves;\r\n    it is then known by the name of Savoys and Brussels Sprouts.\r\n    Another of its headed forms, but with smooth glaucous leaves, is\r\n    the cultivated Cabbage of our gardens (the _Borecole oleracea\r\n    capitula_ of science); and all its varieties of green, red,\r\n    dwarf, tall, early, late, round, conical, flat, and all the\r\n    forms into which it is possible to put it.\r\n\r\nTO BOIL YOUNG GREENS OR SPROUTS.\r\n\r\n1097. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt; a _very small_ piece of soda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRUSSELS SPROUTS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick away all the dead leaves, and wash the greens well in cold\r\nwater; drain them in a colander, and put them into fast-boiling water,\r\nwith salt and soda in the above proportion. Keep them boiling quickly,\r\nwith the lid uncovered, until tender; and the moment they are done, take\r\nthem up, or their colour will be spoiled; when well drained, serve. The\r\ngreat art in cooking greens properly, and to have them a good colour, is\r\nto put them into _plenty_ of _fast-boiling_ water, to let them boil very\r\nquickly, and to take them up the moment they become tender.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Brocoli sprouts, 10 to 12 minutes; young greens, 10 to 12\r\nminutes; sprouts, 12 minutes, after the water boils.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Sprouts of various kinds may be had all the year.\r\n\r\n    GREEN KALE, OR BORECOLE.--When Colewort, or Wild Cabbage, is\r\n    brought into a state of cultivation, its character becomes\r\n    greatly improved, although it still retains the loose open\r\n    leaves, and in this form it is called Green Kale, or Borecole.\r\n    The scientific name is _Borecole oleracea acephala_, and of it\r\n    there are many varieties, both as regards the form and colour of\r\n    the leaves, as well as the height which the plants attain. We\r\n    may observe, that among them, are included the Thousand-headed,\r\n    and the Cow or Tree Cabbage.\r\n\r\nBOILED CABBAGE.\r\n\r\n1098. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt; a _very small_ piece of soda. _Mode_.--Pick off\r\nall the dead outside leaves, cut off as much of the stalk as possible,\r\nand cut the cabbages across twice, at the stalk end; if they should be\r\nvery large, quarter them. Wash them well in cold water, place them in a\r\ncolander, and drain; then put them into _plenty_ of _fast-boiling_\r\nwater, to which have been added salt and soda in the above proportions.\r\nStir them down once or twice in the water, keep the pan uncovered, and\r\nlet them boil quickly until tender. The instant they are done, take them\r\nup into a colander, place a plate over them, let them thoroughly drain,\r\ndish, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Large cabbages, or savoys, 1/3 to 3/4 hour, young summer\r\ncabbage, 10 to 12 minutes, after the water boils.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2d. each in full season.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--2 large ones for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Cabbages and sprouts of various kinds at any time.\r\n\r\n    THE CABBAGE TRIBE: THEIR ORIGIN.--Of all the tribes of the\r\n    _Cruciferae_ this is by far the most important. Its scientific\r\n    name is _Brassiceae_, and it contains a collection of plants\r\n    which, both in themselves and their products, occupy a prominent\r\n    position in agriculture, commerce, and domestic economy. On the\r\n    cliffs of Dover, and in many places on the coasts of\r\n    Dorsetshire, Cornwall, and Yorkshire, there grows a wild plant,\r\n    with variously-indented, much-waved, and loose spreading leaves,\r\n    of a sea-green colour, and large yellow flowers. In spring, the\r\n    leaves of this plant are collected by the inhabitants, who,\r\n    after boiling them in two waters, to remove the saltness, use\r\n    them as a vegetable along with their meat. This is the _Brassica\r\n    oleracea_ of science, the Wild Cabbage, or Colewort, from which\r\n    have originated all the varieties of Cabbage, Cauliflower,\r\n    Greens, and Brocoli.\r\n\r\nSTEWED RED CABBAGE.\r\n\r\n1099. INGREDIENTS.--1 red cabbage, a small slice of ham, 1/2 oz. of\r\nfresh butter, 1 pint of weak stock or broth, 1 gill of vinegar, salt and\r\npepper to taste, 1 tablespoonful of pounded sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the cabbage into very thin slices, put it into a stewpan,\r\nwith the ham cut in dice, the butter, 1/2 pint of stock, and the\r\nvinegar; cover the pan closely, and let it stew for 1 hour. When it is\r\nvery tender, add the remainder of the stock, a seasoning of salt and\r\npepper, and the pounded sugar; mix all well together, stir over the fire\r\nuntil nearly all the liquor is dried away, and serve. Fried sausages are\r\nusually sent to table with this dish: they should be laid round and on\r\nthe cabbage, as a garnish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1 hour. _Average cost_, 4d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to January.\r\n\r\n    THE WILD CABBAGE, OR COLEWORT.--This plant, as it is found on\r\n    the sea-cliffs of England, presents us with the origin of the\r\n    cabbage tribe in its simplest and normal form. In this state it\r\n    is the true Collet, or Colewort, although the name is now\r\n    applied to any young cabbage which has a loose and open heart.\r\n\r\nBOILED CARROTS.\r\n\r\n1100. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water, allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt; carrots.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut off the green tops, wash and scrape the carrots, and should\r\nthere be any black specks, remove them. If very large, cut them in\r\nhalves, divide them lengthwise into four pieces, and put them into\r\nboiling water, salted in the above proportion; let them boil until\r\ntender, which may be ascertained by thrusting a fork into them: dish,\r\nand serve very hot. This vegetable is an indispensable accompaniment to\r\nboiled beef. When thus served, it is usually boiled with the beef; a few\r\ncarrots are placed round the dish as a garnish, and the remainder sent\r\nto table in a vegetable-dish. Young carrots do not require nearly so\r\nmuch boiling, nor should they be divided: these make a nice addition to\r\nstewed veal, &c.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Large carrots, 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 hours; young ones, about 1/2\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d. to 8d, per bunch of 18.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--4 large carrots for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Young carrots from April to June, old ones at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARROTS.]\r\n\r\n    ORIGIN OF THE CARROT.--In its wild state, this vegetable is\r\n    found plentifully in Britain, both in cultivated lands and by\r\n    waysides, and is known by the name of birds-nest, from its\r\n    umbels of fruit becoming incurved from a hollow cup, like a\r\n    birds-nest. In this state its root is whitish, slender, and\r\n    hard, with an acrid, disagreeable taste, and a strong aromatic\r\n    smell, and was formerly used as an aperient. When cultivated, it\r\n    is reddish, thick, fleshy, with a pleasant odour, and a\r\n    peculiar, sweet, mucilaginous taste. The carrot is said by\r\n    naturalists not to contain much nourishing matter, and,\r\n    generally speaking, is somewhat difficult of digestion.\r\n\r\nTO DRESS CARROTS IN THE GERMAN WAY.\r\n\r\n1101. INGREDIENTS.--8 large carrots, 3 oz. of butter, salt to taste, a\r\nvery little grated nutmeg, 1 tablespoonful of finely-minced parsley, 1\r\ndessertspoonful of minced onion, rather more than 1 pint of weak stock\r\nor broth, 1 tablespoonful of flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash and scrape the carrots, and cut them into rings of about\r\n1/4 inch in thickness. Put the butter into a stewpan; when it is melted,\r\nlay in the carrots, with salt, nutmeg, parsley, and onion in the above\r\nproportions. Toss the stewpan over the fire for a few minutes, and when\r\nthe carrots are well saturated with the butter, pour in the stock, and\r\nsimmer gently until they are nearly tender. Then put into another\r\nstewpan a small piece of butter; dredge in about a tablespoonful of\r\nflour; stir this over the fire, and when of a nice brown colour, add the\r\nliquor that the carrots have been boiling in; let this just boil up,\r\npour it over the carrots in the other stewpan, and let them finish\r\nsimmering until quite tender. Serve very hot.\r\n\r\nThis vegetable, dressed as above, is a favourite accompaniment of roast\r\npork, sausages, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3/4 hour. Average cost, 6d. to 8d. per bunch of 18.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Young carrots from April to June, old ones at any time.\r\n\r\n    CONSTITUENTS OF THE CARROT.--These are crystallizable and\r\n    uncrystallizable sugar, a little starch, extractive, gluten,\r\n    albumen, volatile oil, vegetable jelly, or pectin, saline\r\n    matter, malic acid, and a peculiar crystallizable ruby-red\r\n    neuter principle, without odour or taste, called carotin. This\r\n    vegetable jelly, or pectin, so named from its singular property\r\n    of gelatinizing, is considered by some as another form of gum or\r\n    mucilage, combined with vegetable acid. It exists more or less\r\n    in all vegetables, and is especially abundant in those roots and\r\n    fruits from which jellies are prepared.\r\n\r\nSTEWED CARROTS.\r\n\r\n1102. INGREDIENTS.--7 or 8 large carrots, 1 teacupful of broth, pepper\r\nand salt to taste, 1/2 teacupful of cream, thickening of butter and\r\nflour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scrape the carrots nicely; half-boil, and slice them into a\r\nstewpan; add the broth, pepper and salt, and cream; simmer till tender,\r\nand be careful the carrots are not broken. A few minutes before serving,\r\nmix a little flour with about 1 oz. of butter; thicken the gravy with\r\nthis; let it just boil up, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3/4 hour to parboil the carrots, about 20 minutes to cook\r\nthem after they are sliced.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d. to 8d. per bunch of 18.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Young carrots from April to June, old ones at any time.\r\n\r\n    NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES OF THE CARROT.--Sir H. Davy ascertained the\r\n    nutritive matter of the carrot to amount to ninety-eight parts\r\n    in one thousand; of which ninety-five are sugar and three are\r\n    starch. It is used in winter and spring in the dairy to give\r\n    colour and flavour to butter; and it is excellent in stews,\r\n    haricots, soups, and, when boiled whole, with salt beef. In the\r\n    distillery, owing to the great proportion of sugar in its\r\n    composition, it yields more spirit than the potato. The usual\r\n    quantity is twelve gallons per ton.\r\n\r\nSLICED CARROTS.\r\n\r\n(Entremets, or to be served with the Second Course, as a Side-dish.)\r\n\r\n1103. INGREDIENTS.--5 or 6 large carrots, a large lump of sugar, 1 pint\r\nof weak stock, 3 oz. of fresh butter, salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scrape and wash the carrots, cut them into slices of an equal\r\nsize, and boil them in salt and water, until half done; drain them well,\r\nput them into a stewpan with the sugar and stock, and let them boil over\r\na brisk fire. When reduced to a glaze, add the fresh butter and a\r\nseasoning of salt; shake the stewpan about well, and when the butter is\r\nwell mixed with the carrots, serve. There should be no sauce in the dish\r\nwhen it comes to table, but it should all adhere to the carrots.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d. to 8d. per bunch of 18.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Young carrots from April to June, old ones at any time.\r\n\r\n    THE SEED OF THE CARROT.--In order to save the seed of carrots,\r\n    the plan is, to select annually the most perfect and best-shaped\r\n    roots in the taking-up season, and either preserve them in sand\r\n    in a cellar till spring, or plant them immediately in an open\r\n    airy part of the garden, protecting them with litter during\r\n    severe frost, or earthing them over, and uncovering them in\r\n    March following. The seed is in no danger from being injured by\r\n    any other plant. In August it is fit to gather, and is best\r\n    preserved on the stalks till wanted.\r\n\r\nBOILED CAULIFLOWERS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILED CAULIFLOWER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAULIFLOWER.]\r\n\r\n1104. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose cauliflowers that are close and white; trim off the\r\ndecayed outside leaves, and cut the stalk off flat at the bottom. Open\r\nthe flower a little in places to remove the insects, which generally are\r\nfound about the stalk, and let the cauliflowers lie in salt and water\r\nfor an hour previous to dressing them, with their heads downwards: this\r\nwill effectually draw out all the vermin. Then put them into\r\nfast-boiling water, with the addition of salt in the above proportion,\r\nand let them boil briskly over a good fire, keeping the saucepan\r\nuncovered. The water should be well skimmed; and, when the cauliflowers\r\nare tender, take them up with a slice; let them drain, and, if large\r\nenough, place them upright in the dish. Serve with plain melted butter,\r\na little of which may be poured over the flower.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Small cauliflower, 12 to 15 minutes, large one, 20 to 25\r\nminutes, after the water boils.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for large cauliflowers, 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 large cauliflower for 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the beginning of June to the end of September.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAULIFLOWERS A LA SAUCE BLANCHE.\r\n\r\n(Entremets, or Side-dish, to be served with the Second Course.)\r\n\r\n1105. INGREDIENTS.--3 cauliflowers, 1/2 pint of sauce blanche, or French\r\nmelted butter, No. 378; 3 oz. of butter; salt and water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cleanse the cauliflowers as in the preceding recipe, and cut\r\nthe stalks off flat at the bottom; boil them until tender in salt and\r\nwater, to which the above proportion of butter has been added, and be\r\ncareful to take them up the moment they are done, or they will break,\r\nand the appearance of the dish will be spoiled. Drain them well, and\r\ndish them in the shape of a large cauliflower. Have ready 1/2 pint of\r\nsauce, made by recipe No. 378, pour it over the flowers, and serve hot\r\nand quickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Small cauliflowers, 12 to 15 minutes, large ones, 20 to 25\r\nminutes, after the water boils.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_,--large cauliflowers, in full season, 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--1 large cauliflower for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the beginning of June to the end of September.\r\n\r\n    CAULIFLOWER AND BROCOLI.--These are only forms of the wild\r\n    Cabbage in its cultivated state. They are both well known; but\r\n    we may observe, that the purple and white Brocoli are only\r\n    varieties of the Cauliflower.\r\n\r\nCAULIFLOWERS WITH PARMESAN CHEESE.\r\n\r\n(Entremets, or Side-dish, to be served with the Second Course.)\r\n\r\n1106. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 cauliflowers, rather more than 1/2 pint of\r\nwhite sauce No. 378, 2 tablespoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese, 2 oz.\r\nof fresh butter, 3 tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cleanse and boil the cauliflowers by recipe No. 1104, and drain\r\nthem and dish them with the flowers standing upright. Have ready the\r\nabove proportion of white sauce; pour sufficient of it over the\r\ncauliflowers just to cover the top; sprinkle over this some rasped\r\nParmesan cheese and bread crumbs, and drop on these the butter, which\r\nshould be melted, but not oiled. Brown with a salamander, or before the\r\nfire, and pour round, but not over, the flowers the remainder of the\r\nsauce, with which should be mixed a small quantity of grated Parmesan\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, for large cauliflowers,\r\n6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--3 small cauliflowers for 1 dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the beginning of June to the end of September.\r\n\r\n\r\nCELERY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CELERY IN GLASS.]\r\n\r\n1107. With a good heart, and nicely blanched, this vegetable is\r\ngenerally eaten raw, and is usually served with the cheese. Let the\r\nroots be washed free from dirt, all the decayed and outside leaves being\r\ncut off, preserving as much of the stalk as possible, and all specks or\r\nblemishes being carefully removed. Should the celery be large, divide it\r\nlengthwise into quarters, and place it, root downwards, in a\r\ncelery-glass, which should be rather more than half filled with water.\r\nThe top leaves may be curled, by shredding them in narrow strips with\r\nthe point of a clean skewer, at a distance of about 4 inches from the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2d. per head.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 2 heads for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to April.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This vegetable is exceedingly useful for flavouring soups,\r\nsauces, &c., and makes a very nice addition to winter salad.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED CELERY A LA CREME.\r\n\r\n1108. INGREDIENTS.--6 heads of celery; to each 1/2 gallon of water allow\r\n1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1/3 pint of\r\ncream.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the celery thoroughly; trim, and boil it in salt and water\r\nuntil tender. Put the cream and pounded mace into a stewpan; shake it\r\nover the fire until the cream thickens, dish the celery, pour over the\r\nsauce, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Large heads of celery, 25 minutes; small ones, 15 to 20\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_. 2d. per head.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to April.\r\n\r\nALEXANDERS.--This plant is the _Smyrnium olustratum_ of science, and is\r\nused in this country in the same way in which celery is. It is a native\r\nof Great Britain, and is found in its wild state near the seacoast. It\r\nreceived its name from the Italian \"herba Alexandrina,\" and is supposed\r\nto have been originally brought from Alexandria; but, be this as it may,\r\nits cultivation is now almost entirely abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED CELERY (with White Sauce).\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n1109. INGREDIENTS.--6 heads of celery, 1 oz. of butter; to each 1/2\r\ngallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, 1/2 pint of white\r\nsauce, No. 537 or 538.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have ready sufficient boiling water just to cover the celery,\r\nwith salt and butter in the above proportion. Wash the celery well; cut\r\noff the decayed outside leaves, trim away the green tops, and shape the\r\nroot into a point; put it into the boiling water; let it boil rapidly\r\nuntil tender; then take it out, drain well, place it upon a dish, and\r\npour over about 1/2 pint of white sauce, made by either of the recipes\r\nNo. 537 or 538. It may also be plainly boiled as above, placed on toast,\r\nand melted butter poured over, the same as asparagus is dished.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Large heads of celery, 25 minutes, small ones, 15 to 20\r\nminutes, after the water boils.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2d. per head.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to April.\r\n\r\n    ORIGIN OF CELERY.--In the marshes and ditches of this country\r\n    there is to be found a very common plant, known by the name of\r\n    Smallage. This is the wild form of celery; but, by being\r\n    subjected to cultivation, it loses its acrid nature, and becomes\r\n    mild and sweet. In its natural state, it has a peculiar rank,\r\n    coarse taste and smell, and its root was reckoned by the\r\n    ancients as one of the \"five greater aperient roots.\" There is a\r\n    variety of this in which the root becomes turnip-shaped and\r\n    large. It is called _Celeriae_, and is extensively used by the\r\n    Germans, and preferred by them to celery. In a raw state, this\r\n    plant does not suit weak stomachs; cooked, it is less difficult\r\n    of digestion, although a large quantity should not he taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CELERY.].\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n1110. INGREDIENTS.--6 heads of celery, 1/2 pint of white stock or weak\r\nbroth, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, thickening of butter and flour, 1\r\nblade of pounded mace, a _very little_ grated nutmeg; pepper and salt to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the celery, strip off the outer leaves, and cut it into\r\nlengths of about 4 inches. Put these into a saucepan, with the broth,\r\nand stew till tender, which will be in from 20 to 25 minutes; then add\r\nthe remaining ingredients, simmer altogether for 4 or 5 minutes, pour\r\ninto a dish, and serve. It may be garnished with sippets of toasted\r\nbread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 2d. per head.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to April.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--By cutting the celery into smaller pieces, by stewing it a\r\nlittle longer, and, when done, by pressing it through a sieve, the above\r\nstew may be converted into a puree of celery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DRESS CUCUMBERS.\r\n\r\n1111. INGREDIENTS.--3 tablespoonfuls of salad-oil, 4 tablespoonfuls of\r\nvinegar, salt and pepper to taste; cucumber.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare the cucumber, cut it equally into _very thin_ slices, and\r\n_commence_ cutting from the _thick end_; if commenced at the stalk, the\r\ncucumber will most likely have an exceedingly bitter taste, far from\r\nagreeable. Put the slices into a dish, sprinkle over salt and pepper,\r\nand pour over oil and vinegar in the above proportion; turn the cucumber\r\nabout, and it is ready to serve. This is a favourite accompaniment to\r\nboiled salmon, is a nice addition to all descriptions of salads, and\r\nmakes a pretty garnish to lobster salad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLICED CUCUMBERS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUCUMBER.]\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, when scarce, 1s. to 2s. 6d.; when cheapest, may be had\r\nfor 4d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Forced from the beginning of March to the end of June; in\r\nfull season in July, August, and September.\r\n\r\n    GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE CUCUMBERS.--This family is not\r\n    known in the frigid zone, is somewhat rare in the temperate, but\r\n    in the tropical and warmer regions throughout the world they are\r\n    abundant. They are most plentiful in the continent of Hindostan;\r\n    but in America are not near so plentiful. Many of the kinds\r\n    supply useful articles of consumption for food, and others are\r\n    actively medicinal in their virtues. Generally speaking,\r\n    delicate stomachs should avoid this plant, for it is cold and\r\n    indigestible.\r\n\r\nCUCUMBERS A LA POULETTE.\r\n\r\n1112. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 cucumbers, salt and vinegar, 2 oz. of butter,\r\nflour, 1/2 pint of broth, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, a lump of\r\nsugar, the yolks of 2 eggs, salt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare and cut the cucumbers into slices of an equal thickness,\r\nand let them remain in a pickle of salt and vinegar for 1/2 hour; then\r\ndrain them in a cloth, and put them into a stewpan with the butter. Fry\r\nthem over a brisk fire, but do not brown them, and then dredge over them\r\na little flour; add the broth, skim off all the fat, which will rise to\r\nthe surface, and boil gently until the gravy is somewhat reduced; but\r\nthe cucumber should not be broken. Stir in the yolks of the eggs, add\r\nthe parsley, sugar, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; bring the whole\r\nto the point of boiling, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, when cheapest, 4d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July, August, and September; but may be had, forced,\r\nfrom the beginning of March.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED CUCUMBERS.\r\n\r\n1113. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 cucumbers, pepper and salt to taste, flour,\r\noil or butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare the cucumbers and cut them into slices of an equal\r\nthickness, commencing to slice from the thick, and not the stalk end of\r\nthe cucumber. Wipe the slices dry with a cloth, dredge them with flour,\r\nand put them into a pan of boiling oil or butter; Keep turning them\r\nabout until brown; lift them out of the pan, let them drain, and serve,\r\npiled lightly in a dish. These will be found a great improvement to\r\nrump-steak: they should be placed on a dish with the steak on the top.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes. _Average cost_, when cheapest, 4d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Forced from the beginning of March to the end of June; in\r\nfull season in July and August.\r\n\r\n    PROPERTIES AND USES OF THE CUCURBITS.--The common cucumber is\r\n    the C. sativus of science, and although the whole of the family\r\n    have a similar action in the animal economy, yet there are some\r\n    which present us with great anomalies. The roots of those which\r\n    are perennial contain, besides fecula, which is their base, a\r\n    resinous, acrid, and bitter principle. The fruits of this\r\n    family, however, have in general a sugary taste, and are more or\r\n    less dissolving and perfumed, as we find in the melons, gourds,\r\n    cucumbers, vegetable-marrows, and squashes. But these are\r\n    slightly laxative if partaken of largely. In tropical countries,\r\n    this order furnishes the inhabitants with a large portion of\r\n    their food, which, even in the most arid deserts and most barren\r\n    islands, is of the finest quality. In China, Cashmere, and\r\n    Persia, they are cultivated on the lakes on the floating\r\n    collections of weeds common in these localities. In India they\r\n    are everywhere abundant, either in a cultivated or wild state,\r\n    and the seeds of all the family are sweet and mucilaginous.\r\n\r\nSTEWED CUCUMBERS.\r\n\r\n1114. INGREDIENTS.--3 large cucumbers, flour, butter, rather more than\r\n1/2 pint of good brown gravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the cucumbers lengthwise the size of the dish they are\r\nintended to be served in; empty them of the seeds, and put them into\r\nboiling water with a little salt, and let them simmer for 5 minutes;\r\nthen take them out, place them in another stewpan, with the gravy, and\r\nlet them boil over a brisk fire until the cucumbers are tender. Should\r\nthese be bitter, add a lump of sugar; carefully dish them, skim the\r\nsauce, pour over the cucumbers, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, when cheapest, 1d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in June, July, and August; but may be had, forced, from the\r\nbeginning of March.\r\n\r\n    THE CHATE.--This cucumber is a native of Egypt and Arabia, and\r\n    produces a fruit of almost the same substance as that of the\r\n    Melon. In Egypt it is esteemed by the upper class natives, as\r\n    well as by Europeans, as the most pleasant fruit they have.\r\n\r\nSTEWED CUCUMBERS WITH ONIONS.\r\n\r\n1115. INGREDIENTS.--6 cucumbers, 3 moderate-sized onions, not quite 1\r\npint of white stock, cayenne and salt to taste, the yolks of 2 eggs, a\r\nvery little grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare and slice the cucumbers, take out the seeds, and cut the\r\nonions into thin slices; put these both into a stewpan, with the stock,\r\nand let them boil for 1/4 hour or longer, should the cucumbers be very\r\nlarge. Beat up the yolks of 2 eggs; stir these into the sauce; add the\r\ncayenne, salt, and grated nutmeg; bring it to the point of boiling, and\r\nserve. Do not allow the sauce to boil, or it will curdle. This is a\r\nfavourite dish with lamb or mutton chops, rump-steaks, &c.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, when cheapest, 4d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July, August, and September; but may be had, forced,\r\nfrom the beginning of March.\r\n\r\n    THE MELON.--This is another species of the cucumber, and is\r\n    highly esteemed for its rich and delicious fruit. It was\r\n    introduced to this country from Jamaica, in 1570; since which\r\n    period it has continued to be cultivated. It was formerly called\r\n    the Musk Melon.\r\n\r\nENDIVE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENDIVE.]\r\n\r\n1116. This vegetable, so beautiful in appearance, makes an excellent\r\naddition to winter salad, when lettuces and other salad herbs are not\r\nobtainable. It is usually placed in the centre of the dish, and looks\r\nremarkably pretty with slices of beetroot, hard-boiled eggs, and curled\r\ncelery placed round it, so that the colours contrast nicely. In\r\npreparing it, carefully wash and cleanse it free from insects, which are\r\ngenerally found near the heart; remove any decayed or dead leaves, and\r\ndry it thoroughly by shaking in a cloth. This vegetable may also be\r\nserved hot, stewed in cream, brown gravy, or butter; but when dressed\r\nthus, the sauce it is stewed in should not be very highly seasoned, as\r\nthat would destroy and overpower the flavour of the vegetable.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1d. per head.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--1 head for a salad for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n    ENDIVE.--This is the _C. endivium_ of science, and is much used\r\n    as a salad. It belongs to the family of the _Compositae_, with\r\n    Chicory, common Goats-beard, and others of the same genus.\r\n    Withering states, that before the stems of the common\r\n    Goats-beard shoot up the roots, boiled like asparagus, have the\r\n    same flavour, and are nearly as nutritious. We are also informed\r\n    by Villars that the children in Dauphiné universally eat the\r\n    stems and leaves of the young plant before the flowers appear,\r\n    with great avidity. The fresh juice of these tender herbs is\r\n    said to be the best solvent of bile.\r\n\r\nSTEWED ENDIVE.\r\n\r\n1117. INGREDIENTS.--6 heads of endive, salt and water, 1 pint of broth,\r\nthickening of butter and flour, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, a small\r\nlump of sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash and free the endive thoroughly from insects, remove the\r\ngreen part of the leaves, and put it into boiling water, slightly\r\nsalted. Let it remain for 10 minutes; then take it out, drain it till\r\nthere is no water remaining, and chop it very fine. Put it into a\r\nstewpan with the broth; add a little salt and a lump of sugar, and boil\r\nuntil the endive is perfectly tender. When done, which may be\r\nascertained by squeezing a piece between the thumb and finger, add a\r\nthickening of butter and flour and the lemon-juice: let the sauce boil\r\nup, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to boil, 5 minutes to simmer in the broth.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1d. per head.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDIVE A LA FRANCAISE.\r\n\r\n1118. INGREDIENTS.--6 heads of endive, 1 pint of broth, 3 oz. of fresh\r\nbutter; salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash and boil the endive as in the preceding recipe; chop it\r\nrather fine, and put into a stewpan with the broth; boil over a brisk\r\nfire until the sauce is all reduced; then put in the butter, pepper,\r\nsalt, and grated nutmeg (the latter must be very sparingly used); mix\r\nall well together, bring it to the boiling point, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_,--10 minutes to boil, 5 minutes to simmer in the broth.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1d. per head.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BOIL HARICOTS BLANCS, or WHITE HARICOT BEANS.\r\n\r\n1119. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of white haricot beans, 2 quarts of soft\r\nwater, 1 oz. of butter, 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the beans into cold water, and let them soak from 2 to 4\r\nhours, according to their age; then put them into cold water, salted in\r\nthe above proportion, bring them to boil, and let them simmer very\r\nslowly until tender; pour the water away from them, let them stand by\r\nthe side of the fire, with the lid of the saucepan partially off, to\r\nallow the beans to dry; then add 1 oz. of butter and a seasoning of\r\npepper and salt. Shake the beans about for a minute or two, and serve:\r\ndo not stir them with a spoon, for fear of breaking them to pieces.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--After the water boils, from 2 to 2-1/2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter, when other vegetables are scarce.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Haricots blancs, when new and fresh, should be put into boiling\r\nwater, and do not require any soaking previous to dressing.\r\n\r\n    HARICOTS AND LENTILS.--Although these vegetables are not much\r\n    used in this country, yet in France, and other Catholic\r\n    countries, from their peculiar constituent properties, they form\r\n    an excellent substitute for animal food during Lent and _maigre_\r\n    days. At the time of the prevalence of the Roman religion in\r\n    this country, they were probably much more generally used than\r\n    at present. As reformations are often carried beyond necessity,\r\n    possibly lentils may have fallen into disuse, as an article of\r\n    diet amongst Protestants, for fear the use of them might be\r\n    considered a sign of popery.\r\n\r\nHARICOTS BLANCS A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL.\r\n\r\n1120. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of white haricot beans, 1/4 lb. of fresh\r\nbutter, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, pepper and salt to taste, the\r\njuice of 1/2 lemon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARICOT BEANS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Should the beans be very dry, soak them for an hour or two in\r\ncold water, and boil them until perfectly tender, as in the preceding\r\nrecipe. If the water should boil away, replenish it with a little more\r\ncold, which makes the skin of the beans tender. Let them be very\r\nthoroughly done; drain them well; then add to them the butter, minced\r\nparsley, and a seasoning of pepper and salt. Keep moving the stewpan\r\nover the fire without using a spoon, as this would break the beans; and,\r\nwhen the various ingredients are well mixed with them, squeeze in the\r\nlemon-juice, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 2 to 2-1/2 hours to boil the beans.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n    HARICOT BEANS.--This is the _haricot blanc_ of the French, and\r\n    is a native of India. It ripens readily, in dry summers, in most\r\n    parts of Britain, but its culture has hitherto been confined to\r\n    gardens in England; but in Germany and Switzerland it is grown\r\n    in fields. It is usually harvested by pulling up the plants,\r\n    which, being dried, are stacked and thrashed. The haulm is both\r\n    of little bulk and little use, but the seed is used in making\r\n    the esteemed French dish called haricot, with which it were well\r\n    if the working classes of this country were acquainted. There\r\n    is, perhaps, no other vegetable dish so cheap and easily cooked,\r\n    and, at the same time, so agreeable and nourishing. The beans\r\n    are boiled, and then mixed with a little fat or salt butter, and\r\n    a little milk or water and flour. From 3,840 parts of\r\n    kidney-bean Einholff obtained 1,805 parts of matter analogous to\r\n    starch, 351 of vegeto-animal matter, and 799 parts of mucilage.\r\n\r\nHARICOT BEANS AND MINCED ONIONS.\r\n\r\n1121. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of white haricot beans, 4 middling-sized\r\nonions, 1/4 pint of good brown gravy, pepper and salt to taste, a little\r\nflour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel and mince the onions not too finely, and fry them in\r\nbutter of a light brown colour; dredge over them a little flour, and add\r\nthe gravy and a seasoning of pepper and salt. Have ready a pint of\r\nharicot beans well boiled and drained; put them with the onions and\r\ngravy, mix all well together, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 2 to 2-1/2 hours to boil the beans; 5 minutes to fry the\r\nonions.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d. per quart.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSERADISH.\r\n\r\n1122. This root, scraped, is always served with hot roast beef, and is\r\nused for garnishing many kinds of boiled fish. Let the horseradish\r\nremain in cold water for an hour; wash it well, and with a sharp knife\r\nscrape it into very thin shreds, commencing from the thick end of the\r\nroot. Arrange some of it lightly in a small glass dish, and the\r\nremainder use for garnishing the joint: it should be placed in tufts\r\nround the border of the dish, with 1 or 2 bunches on the meat.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2d. per stick.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORSERADISH.]\r\n\r\n    THE HORSERADISH.--This belongs to the tribe _Alyssidae_, and is\r\n    highly stimulant and exciting to the stomach. It has been\r\n    recommended in chronic rheumatism, palsy, dropsical complaints,\r\n    and in cases of enfeebled digestion. Its principal use, however,\r\n    is as a condiment to promote appetite and excite the digestive\r\n    organs. The horseradish contains sulphur to the extent of thirty\r\n    per cent, in the number of its elements; and it is to the\r\n    presence of this quality that the metal vessels in which the\r\n    radish is sometimes distilled, are turned into a black colour.\r\n    It is one of the most powerful excitants and antiscorbutics we\r\n    have, and forms the basis of several medical preparations, in\r\n    the form of wines, tinctures, and syrups.\r\n\r\nLETTUCES.\r\n\r\n1123. These form one of the principal ingredients to summer salads;\r\nshould be nicely blanched, and be eaten young. They are seldom served in\r\nany other way, but may be stewed and sent to table in a good brown gravy\r\nflavoured with lemon-juice. In preparing them for a salad, carefully\r\nwash them free from dirt, pick off all the decayed and outer leaves, and\r\ndry them thoroughly by shaking them in a cloth. Cut off the stalks, and\r\neither halve or cut the lettuces into small pieces. The manner of\r\ncutting them up entirely depends on the salad for which they are\r\nintended. In France the lettuces are sometimes merely wiped with a cloth\r\nand not washed, the cooks there declaring that the act of washing them\r\ninjuriously affects the pleasant crispness of the plant: in this case\r\nscrupulous attention must be paid to each leaf, and the grit thoroughly\r\nwiped away.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, when cheapest, 1d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 2 lettuces for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to the end of August, but may be had all the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LETTUCE.]\r\n\r\n    THE LETTUCE.--All the varieties of the garden lettuce have\r\n    originated from the _Lactuca sativa_ of science, which has never\r\n    yet been found in a wild state. Hence it may be concluded that\r\n    it is merely another form of some species, changed through the\r\n    effects of cultivation. In its young state, the lettuce forms a\r\n    well-known and wholesome salad, containing a bland pellucid\r\n    juice, with little taste or smell, and having a cooling and\r\n    soothing influence on the system. This arises from the large\r\n    quantities of water and mucilage it contains, and not from any\r\n    narcotic principle which it is supposed to possess. During the\r\n    period of flowering, it abounds in a peculiar milky juice, which\r\n    flows from the stem when wounded, and which has been found to be\r\n    possessed of decided medicinal properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n(A Breakfast, Luncheon, or Supper Dish.)\r\n\r\n1124. INGREDIENTS.--16 to 20 mushroom-flaps, butter, pepper to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--For this mode of cooking, the mushroom flaps are better than\r\nthe buttons, and should not be too large. Cut off a portion of the\r\nstalk, peel the top, and wipe the mushrooms carefully with a piece of\r\nflannel and a little fine salt. Put them into a tin baking-dish, with a\r\nvery small piece of butter placed on each mushroom; sprinkle over a\r\nlittle pepper, and let them bake for about 20 minutes, or longer should\r\nthe mushrooms be very large. Have ready a _very hot_ dish, pile the\r\nmushrooms high in the centre, pour the gravy round, and send them to\r\ntable quickly, with very _hot_ plates.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes; large mushrooms, 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1d. each for large mushroom-flaps.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Meadow mushrooms in September and October; cultivated\r\nmushrooms may be had at any time.\r\n\r\n    FUNGI.--These are common parasitical plants, originating in the\r\n    production of copious filamentous threads, called the mycelium,\r\n    or spawn. Rounded tubers appear on the mycelium; some of these\r\n    enlarge rapidly, burst an outer covering, which is left at the\r\n    base, and protrude a thick stalk, bearing at its summit a\r\n    rounded body, which in a short time expands into the pileus or\r\n    cap. The gills, which occupy its lower surface, consist of\r\n    parallel plates, bearing naked sporules over their whole\r\n    surface. Some of the cells, which are visible by the microscope,\r\n    produce four small cells at their free summit, apparently by\r\n    germination and constriction. These are the sporules, and this\r\n    is the development of the Agarics.\r\n\r\nBROILED MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n(A Breakfast, Luncheon, or Supper Dish.)\r\n\r\n1125. INGREDIENTS.--Mushroom-flaps, pepper and salt to taste, butter,\r\nlemon-juice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROILED MUSHROOMS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cleanse the mushrooms by wiping them with a piece of flannel\r\nand a little salt; cut off a portion of the stalk, and peel the tops:\r\nbroil them over a clear fire, turning them once, and arrange them on a\r\nvery hot dish. Put a small piece of butter on each mushroom, season with\r\npepper and salt, and squeeze over them a few drops of lemon-juice. Place\r\nthe dish before the fire, and when the butter is melted, serve very hot\r\nand quickly. Moderate-sized flaps are better suited to this mode of\r\ncooking than the buttons: the latter are better in stews.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes for medium-sized mushrooms.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1d. each for large mushrooms.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 3 or 4 mushrooms to each person.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Meadow mushrooms in September and October; cultivated\r\nmushrooms may be had at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSHROOMS.]\r\n\r\n    VARIETIES OF THE MUSHROOM.--The common mushroom found in our\r\n    pastures is the _Agaricus campestris_ of science, and another\r\n    edible British species is _A. Georgii;_ but _A. primulus_ is\r\n    affirmed to be the most delicious mushroom. The morel is\r\n    _Morchella esculenta_, and _Tuber cibarium_ is the common\r\n    truffle. There is in New Zealand a long fungus, which grows from\r\n    the head of a caterpillar, and which forms a horn, as it were,\r\n    and is called _Sphaeria Robertsii_.\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n1126. INGREDIENTS.--To each quart of mushrooms, allow 3 oz. of butter,\r\npepper and salt to taste, the juice of 1 lemon, clarified butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the mushrooms, put them into cold water, with a little\r\nlemon-juice; take them out and _dry_ them very carefully in a cloth. Put\r\nthe butter into a stewpan capable of holding the mushrooms; when it is\r\nmelted, add the mushrooms, lemon-juice, and a seasoning of pepper and\r\nsalt; draw them down over a slow fire, and let them remain until their\r\nliquor is boiled away, and they have become quite dry, but be careful in\r\nnot allowing them to stick to the bottom of the stewpan. When done, put\r\nthem into pots, and pour over the top clarified butter. If wanted for\r\nimmediate use, they will keep good a few days without being covered\r\nover. To re-warm them, put the mushrooms into a stewpan, strain the\r\nbutter from them, and they will be ready for use.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Meadow mushrooms in September and October; cultivated\r\nmushrooms may be had at any time.\r\n\r\n    LOCALITIES OF THE MUSHROOM.--Mushrooms are to be met with in\r\n    pastures, woods, and marshes, but are very capricious and\r\n    uncertain in their places of growth, multitudes being obtained\r\n    in one season where few or none were to be found in the\r\n    preceding. They sometimes grow solitary, but more frequently\r\n    they are gregarious, and rise in a regular circular form. Many\r\n    species are employed by man as food; but, generally speaking,\r\n    they are difficult of digestion, and by no means very\r\n    nourishing. Many of them are also of suspicious qualities.\r\n    Little reliance can be placed either on their taste, smell, or\r\n    colour, as much depends on the situation in which they vegetate;\r\n    and even the same plant, it is affirmed, may be innocent when\r\n    young, but become noxious when advanced in age.\r\n\r\nSTEWED MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n1127. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint mushroom-buttons, 3 oz. of fresh butter,\r\nwhite pepper and salt to taste, lemon-juice, 1 teaspoonful of flour,\r\ncream or milk, 1 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut off the ends of the stalks, and pare neatly a pint of\r\nmushroom-buttons; put them into a basin of water, with a little\r\nlemon-juice, as they are done. When all are prepared, take them from the\r\nwater with the hands, to avoid the sediment, and put them into a stewpan\r\nwith the fresh butter, white pepper, salt, and the juice of 1/2 lemon;\r\ncover the pan closely, and let the mushrooms stew gently from 20 to 25\r\nminutes; then thicken the butter with the above proportion of flour, add\r\ngradually sufficient cream, or cream and milk, to make the sauce of a\r\nproper consistency, and put in the grated nutmeg. If the mushrooms are\r\nnot perfectly tender, stew them for 5 minutes longer, remove every\r\nparticle of butter which may be floating on the top, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, from 9d. to 2s. per pint.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Meadow mushrooms in September and October.\r\n\r\n    TO PROCURE MUSHROOMS.--In order to obtain mushrooms at all\r\n    seasons, several methods of propagation have been had recourse\r\n    to. It is said that, in some parts of Italy, a species of stone\r\n    is used for this purpose, which is described as being of two\r\n    different kinds; the one is found in the chalk hills near\r\n    Naples, and has a white, porous, stalactical appearance; the\r\n    other is a hardened turf from some volcanic mountains near\r\n    Florence. These stones are kept in cellars, and occasionally\r\n    moistened with water which has been used in the washing of\r\n    mushrooms, and are thus supplied with their minute seeds. In\r\n    this country, gardeners provide themselves with what is called\r\n    _spawn_, either from the old manure of cucumber-beds, or\r\n    purchase it from those whose business it is to propagate it.\r\n    When thus procured, it is usually made up for sale in quadrils,\r\n    consisting of numerous white fibrous roots, having a strong\r\n    smell of mushrooms. This is planted in rows, in a dry situation,\r\n    and carefully attended to for five or six weeks, when the bed\r\n    begins to produce, and continues to do so for several months.\r\n\r\nSTEWED MUSHROOMS IN GRAVY.\r\n\r\n1128. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of mushroom-buttons, 1 pint of brown gravy\r\nNo. 436, 1/4 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, cayenne and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a pint of brown gravy by recipe 436; cut nearly all the\r\nstalks away from the mushrooms and peel the tops; put them into a\r\nstewpan, with the gravy, and simmer them gently from 20 minutes to 1/2\r\nhour. Add the nutmeg and a seasoning of cayenne and salt, and serve very\r\nhot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d. to 2s. per pint.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Meadow mushrooms in September and October.\r\n\r\n    ANALYSIS OF FUNGI.--The fungi have been examined chemically with\r\n    much care, both by MM. Bracannot and Vauquelin, who designate\r\n    the insoluble spongy matter by the name of fungin, and the\r\n    soluble portion is found to contain the bolotic and the fungic\r\n    acids.\r\n\r\nBAKED SPANISH ONIONS.\r\n\r\n1129. INGREDIENTS.--4 or 5 Spanish onions, salt, and water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the onions, with their skins on, into a saucepan of boiling\r\nwater slightly salted, and let them boil quickly for an hour. Then take\r\nthem out, wipe them thoroughly, wrap each one in a piece of paper\r\nseparately, and bake them in a moderate oven for 2 hours, or longer,\r\nshould the onions be very large. They may be served in their skins, and\r\neaten with a piece of cold butter and a seasoning of pepper and salt; or\r\nthey may be peeled, and a good brown gravy poured over them.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour to boil, 2 hours to bake.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, medium-sized, 2d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to January.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONION.]\r\n\r\n    THE GENUS ALLIUM.--The Onion, like the Leek, Garlic, and Shalot,\r\n    belongs to the genus _Allium_, which is a numerous species of\r\n    vegetable; and every one of them possesses, more or less, a\r\n    volatile and acrid penetrating principle, pricking the thin\r\n    transparent membrane of the eyelids; and all are very similar in\r\n    their properties. In the whole of them the bulb is the most\r\n    active part, and any one of them may supply the place of the\r\n    other; for they are all irritant, excitant, and vesicant. With\r\n    many, the onion is a very great favourite, and is considered an\r\n    extremely nutritive vegetable. The Spanish kind is frequently\r\n    taken for supper, it being simply boiled, and then seasoned with\r\n    salt, pepper, and butter. Some dredge on a little flour, but\r\n    many prefer it without this.\r\n\r\nBURNT ONIONS FOR GRAVIES.\r\n\r\n1130. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of onions, 1/3 pint of water, 1/2 lb. of\r\nmoist sugar, 1/3 pint of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel and chop the onions fine, and put them into a stewpan (not\r\ntinned), with the water; let them boil for 5 minutes, then add the\r\nsugar, and simmer gently until the mixture becomes nearly black and\r\nthrows out bubbles of smoke. Have ready the above proportion of boiling\r\nvinegar, strain the liquor gradually to it, and keep stirring with a\r\nwooden spoon until it is well incorporated. When cold, bottle for use.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1 hour.\r\n\r\n    PROPERTIES OF THE ONION.--The onion is possessed of a white,\r\n    acrid, volatile oil, holding sulphur in solution, albumen, a\r\n    good deal of uncrystallizable sugar and mucilage; phosphoric\r\n    acid, both free and combined with lime; acetic acid, citrate of\r\n    lime, and lignine. Of all the species of allium, the onion has\r\n    the volatile principle in the greatest degree; and hence it is\r\n    impossible to separate the scales of the root without the eyes\r\n    being affected. The juice is sensibly acid, and is capable of\r\n    being, by fermentation, converted into vinegar, and, mixed with\r\n    water or the dregs of beer, yields, by distillation, an\r\n    alcoholic liquor. Although used as a common esculent, onions are\r\n    not suited to all stomachs; there are some who cannot eat them\r\n    either fried or roasted, whilst others prefer them boiled, which\r\n    is the best way of using them, as, by the process they then\r\n    undergo, they are deprived of their essential oil. The pulp of\r\n    roasted onions, with oil, forms an excellent anodyne and\r\n    emollient poultice to suppurating tumours.\r\n\r\nSTEWED SPANISH ONIONS.\r\n\r\n1131--INGREDIENTS.--5 or 6 Spanish onions, 1 pint of good broth or\r\ngravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the onions, taking care not to cut away too much of the\r\ntops or tails, or they would then fall to pieces; put them into a\r\nstewpan capable of holding them at the bottom without piling them one on\r\nthe top of another; add the broth or gravy, and simmer _very gently_\r\nuntil the onions are perfectly tender. Dish them, pour the gravy round,\r\nand serve. Instead of using broth, Spanish onions may be stewed with a\r\nlarge piece of butter: they must be done very gradually over a slow fire\r\nor hot-plate, and will produce plenty of gravy.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To stew in gravy, 2 hours, or longer if very large.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_.--medium-sized, 2d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to January.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Stewed Spanish onions are a favourite accompaniment to roast\r\nshoulder of mutton.\r\n\r\n    ORIGIN OF THE ONION.--This vegetable is thought to have\r\n    originally come from India, through Egypt, where it became an\r\n    object of worship. Thence it was transmitted to Greece, thence\r\n    to Italy, and ultimately it was distributed throughout Europe,\r\n    in almost every part of which it has, from time immemorial, been\r\n    cultivated. In warm climates it is found to be less acrid and\r\n    much sweeter than in colder latitudes; and in Spain it is not at\r\n    all unusual to see a peasant munching an onion, as an Englishman\r\n    would an apple. Spanish onions, which are imported to this\r\n    country during the winter months, are, when properly roasted,\r\n    perfectly sweet, and equal to many preserves.\r\n\r\nBOILED PARSNIPS.\r\n\r\n1132. INGREDIENTS.--Parsnips; to each gallon of water allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the parsnips, scrape them thoroughly, and, with the point\r\nof the knife, remove any black specks about them, and, should they be\r\nvery large, cut the thick part into quarters. Put them into a saucepan\r\nof boiling water salted in the above proportion, boil them rapidly until\r\ntender, which may be ascertained by thrusting a fork in them; take them\r\nup, drain them, and serve in a vegetable-dish. This vegetable is usually\r\nserved with salt fish, boiled pork, or boiled beef: when sent to table\r\nwith the latter, a few should be placed alternately with carrots round\r\nthe dish, as a garnish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Large parsnips, 1 to 1-1/2 hour; small ones, 1/2 to 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 for each person.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to May.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PARSNIP.]\r\n\r\n    THE PARSNIP.--This vegetable is found wild in meadows all over\r\n    Europe, and, in England, is met with very frequently on dry\r\n    banks in a chalky soil. In its wild state, the root is white,\r\n    mucilaginous, aromatic, and sweet, with some degree of acrimony:\r\n    when old, it has been known to cause vertigo. Willis relates\r\n    that a whole family fell into delirium from having eaten of its\r\n    roots, and cattle never touch it in its wild state. In domestic\r\n    economy the parsnip is much used, and is found to be a highly\r\n    nutritious vegetable. In times of scarcity, an excellent bread\r\n    has been made from the roots, and they also furnish an excellent\r\n    wine, resembling the malmsey of Madeira and the Canaries: a\r\n    spirit is also obtained from them in as great quantities as from\r\n    carrots. The composition of the parsnip-root has been found to\r\n    be 79.4 of water, 0.9 starch and fibre, 6.1 gum, 5.5 sugar, and\r\n    2.1 of albumen.\r\n\r\nBOILED GREEN PEAS.\r\n\r\n1133. INGREDIENTS.--Green peas; to each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1\r\n_small_ teaspoonful of moist sugar, 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--This delicious vegetable, to be eaten in perfection, should be\r\nyoung, and not _gathered_ or _shelled_ long before it is dressed. Shell\r\nthe peas, wash them well in cold water, and drain them; then put them\r\ninto a saucepan with plenty of _fast-boiling_ water, to which salt and\r\n_moist sugar_ have been added in the above proportion; let them boil\r\nquickly over a brisk fire, with the lid of the saucepan uncovered, and\r\nbe careful that the smoke does not draw in. When tender, pour them into\r\na colander; put them into a hot vegetable-dish, and quite in the centre\r\nof the peas place a piece of butter, the size of a walnut. Many cooks\r\nboil a small bunch of mint _with_ the _peas_, or garnish them with it,\r\nby boiling a few sprigs in a saucepan by themselves. Should the peas be\r\nvery old, and difficult to boil a good colour, a very tiny piece of soda\r\nmay be thrown in the water previous to putting them in; but this must be\r\nvery sparingly used, as it causes the peas, when boiled, to have a\r\nsmashed and broken appearance. With young peas, there is not the\r\nslightest occasion to use it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Young peas, 10 to 15 minutes; the large sorts, such as\r\nmarrowfats, &c., 18 to 24 minutes; old peas, 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, when cheapest, 6d. per peck; when first in season, 1s.\r\nto 1s. 6d. per peck.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 peck of unshelled peas for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to the end of August.\r\n\r\n    ORIGIN OF THE PEA.--All the varieties of garden peas which are\r\n    cultivated have originated from the _Pisum sativum_, a native of\r\n    the south of Europe; and field peas are varieties of _Pisum\r\n    arvense_. The Everlasting Pea is _Lathyrus latifolius_, an old\r\n    favourite in flower-gardens. It is said to yield an abundance of\r\n    honey to bees, which are remarkably fond of it. In this country\r\n    the pea has been grown from time immemorial; but its culture\r\n    seems to have diminished since the more general introduction of\r\n    herbage, plants, and roots.\r\n\r\nGREEN PEAS A LA FRANCAISE.\r\n\r\n1134. INGREDIENTS.--2 quarts of green peas, 3 oz. of fresh butter, a\r\nbunch of parsley, 6 green onions, flour, a small lump of sugar, 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Shell sufficient fresh-gathered peas to fill 2 quarts; put them\r\ninto cold water, with the above proportion of butter, and stir them\r\nabout until they are well covered with the butter; drain them in a\r\ncolander, and put them in a stewpan, with the parsley and onions; dredge\r\nover them a little flour, stir the peas well, and moisten them with\r\nboiling water; boil them quickly over a large fire for 20 minutes, or\r\nuntil there is no liquor remaining. Dip a small lump of sugar into some\r\nwater, that it may soon melt; put it with the peas, to which add 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of salt. Take a piece of butter the size of a walnut, work\r\nit together with a teaspoonful of flour; and add this to the peas, which\r\nshould be boiling when it is put in. Keep shaking the stewpan, and, when\r\nthe peas are nicely thickened, dress them high in the dish, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 6d. per peck.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to the end of August.\r\n\r\n    VARIETIES OF THE PEA.--The varieties of the Pea are numerous;\r\n    but they may be divided into two classes--those grown for the\r\n    ripened seed, and those grown for gathering in a green state.\r\n    The culture of the latter is chiefly confined to the\r\n    neighbourhoods of large towns, and may be considered as in part\r\n    rather to belong to the operations of the gardener than to those\r\n    of the agriculturist. The grey varieties are the early grey, the\r\n    late grey, and the purple grey; to which some add the\r\n    Marlborough grey and the horn grey. The white varieties grown in\r\n    fields are the pearl, early Charlton, golden hotspur, the common\r\n    white, or Suffolk, and other Suffolk varieties.\r\n\r\nSTEWED GREEN PEAS.\r\n\r\n1135. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of peas, 1 Lettuce, 1 onion, 2 oz. of\r\nbutter, pepper and salt to taste, 1 egg, 1/2 teaspoonful of powdered\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Shell the peas, and cut the onion and lettuce into slices; put\r\nthese into a stewpan, with the butter, pepper, and salt, but with no\r\nmore water than that which hangs round the lettuce from washing. Stew\r\nthe whole very gently for rather more than 1 hour; then stir to it a\r\nwell-beaten egg, and about 1/2 teaspoonful of powdered sugar. When the\r\npeas, &c., are nicely thickened, serve but, after the egg is added, do\r\nnot allow them to boil.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/4 hour. _Average cost_, 6d. per peck.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to the end of August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREEN PEA.]\r\n\r\n    THE SWEET-PEA AND THE HEATH OR WOOD-PEA.--The well-known\r\n    sweet-pea forms a fine covering to a trellis, or lattice-work in\r\n    a flower-garden. Its gay and fragrant flowers, with its rambling\r\n    habit, render it peculiarly adapted for such a purpose. The\r\n    wood-pea, or heath-pea, is found in the heaths of Scotland, and\r\n    the Highlanders of that country are extremely partial to them,\r\n    and dry and chew them to give a greater relish to their whiskey.\r\n    They also regard them as good against chest complaints, and say\r\n    that by the use of them they are enabled to withstand hunger and\r\n    thirst for a long time. The peas have a sweet taste, somewhat\r\n    like the root of liquorice, and, when boiled, have an agreeable\r\n    flavour, and are nutritive. In times of scarcity they have\r\n    served as an article of food. When well boiled, a fork will pass\r\n    through them; and, slightly dried, they are roasted, and in\r\n    Holland and Flanders served up like chestnuts.\r\n\r\nBAKED POTATOES.\r\n\r\n1136. INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAKED POTATOES SERVED IN NAPKIN.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose large potatoes, as much of a size as possible; wash them\r\nin lukewarm water, and scrub them well, for the browned skin of a baked\r\npotato is by many persons considered the better part of it. Put them\r\ninto a moderate oven, and bake them for about 2 hours, turning them\r\nthree or four times whilst they are cooking. Serve them in a napkin\r\nimmediately they are done, as, if kept a long time in the oven, they\r\nhave a shrivelled appearance. Potatoes may also be roasted before the\r\nfire, in an American oven; but when thus cooked, they must be done very\r\nslowly. Do not forget to send to table with them a piece of cold butter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Large potatoes, in a hot oven 1-1/2 hour to 2 hours; in a cool\r\noven, 2 to 2-1/2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4s. per bushel.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 2 to each person.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but not good just before and whilst new\r\npotatoes are in season.\r\n\r\n    POTATO-SUGAR.--This sugary substance, found in the tubers of\r\n    potatoes, is obtained in the form of syrup or treacle, and has\r\n    not yet been crystallized. It resembles the sugar of grapes,\r\n    has a very sweet taste, and may be used for making sweetmeats,\r\n    and as a substitute for honey. Sixty pounds of potatoes,\r\n    yielding eight pounds of dry starch, will produce seven and a\r\n    half pounds of sugar. In Russia it is extensively made, as\r\n    good, though of less consistency than the treacle obtained from\r\n    cane-sugar. A spirit is also distilled from the tubers, which\r\n    resembles brandy, but is milder, and has a flavour as if it were\r\n    charged with the odour of violets or raspberries. In France\r\n    this manufacture is carried on pretty extensively, and five\r\n    hundred pounds of the tubers will produce twelve quarts of\r\n    spirit, the pulp being given to cattle.\r\n\r\nTO BOIL POTATOES.\r\n\r\n1137. INGREDIENTS.--10 or 12 potatoes; to each 1/2 gallon of water allow\r\n1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose potatoes of an equal size, pare them, take out all the\r\neyes and specks, and as they are peeled, throw them into cold water. Put\r\nthem into a saucepan, with sufficient cold water to cover them, with\r\nsalt in the above proportion, and let them boil gently until tender.\r\nAscertain when they are done by thrusting a fork in them, and take them\r\nup the moment they feel soft through; for if they are left in the water\r\nafterwards, they become waxy or watery. Drain away the water, put the\r\nsaucepan by the side of the fire, with the lid partially uncovered, to\r\nallow the steam to escape, and let the potatoes get thoroughly dry, and\r\ndo not allow them to get burnt. Their superfluous moisture will\r\nevaporate, and the potatoes, if a good sort, should be perfectly mealy\r\nand dry. Potatoes vary so much in quality and size, that it is difficult\r\nto give the exact time for boiling; they should be attentively watched,\r\nand probed with a fork, to ascertain when they are cooked. Send them to\r\ntable quickly, and very hot, and with an opening in the cover of the\r\ndish, that a portion of the steam may evaporate, and not fall back on\r\nthe potatoes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Moderate-sized old potatoes, 15 to 20 minutes after the water\r\nboils; large ones, 1/2 hour to 35 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4s. per bushel.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but not good just before and whilst new\r\npotatoes are in season.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--To keep potatoes hot, after draining the water from them, put a\r\nfolded cloth or flannel (kept for the purpose) on the top of them,\r\nkeeping the saucepan-lid partially uncovered. This will absorb the\r\nmoisture, and keep them hot some time without spoiling.\r\n\r\n    THE POTATO.--The potato belongs to the family of the\r\n    _Solanaceae_, the greater number of which inhabit the tropics,\r\n    and the remainder are distributed over the temperate regions of\r\n    both hemispheres, but do not extend to the arctic and antarctic\r\n    zones. The whole of the family are suspicious; a great number\r\n    are narcotic, and many are deleterious. The roots partake of the\r\n    properties of the plants, and are sometimes even more active.\r\n    The tubercles of such as produce them, are amylaceous and\r\n    nutritive, as in those of the potato. The leaves are generally\r\n    narcotic; but they lose this principle in boiling, as is the\r\n    case with the _Solanum nigrum_, which are used as a vegetable\r\n    when cooked.\r\n\r\nTO BOIL POTATOES IN THEIR JACKETS.\r\n\r\n1138. INGREDIENTS.--10 or 12 potatoes; to each 1/2 gallon of water,\r\nallow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--To obtain this wholesome and delicious vegetable cooked in\r\nperfection, it should be boiled and sent to table with the skin on. In\r\nIreland, where, perhaps, the cooking of potatoes is better understood\r\nthan in any country, they are always served so. Wash the potatoes well,\r\nand if necessary, use a clean scrubbing-brush to remove the dirt from\r\nthem; and if possible, choose the potatoes so that they may all be as\r\nnearly the same size as possible. When thoroughly cleansed, fill the\r\nsaucepan half full with them, and just cover the potatoes with cold\r\nwater, salted in the above proportion: they are more quickly boiled with\r\na small quantity of water, and, besides, are more savoury than when\r\ndrowned in it. Bring them to boil, then draw the pan to the side of the\r\nfire, and let them simmer gently until tender. Ascertain when they are\r\ndone by probing them with a fork; then pour off the water, uncover the\r\nsaucepan, and let the potatoes dry by the side of the fire, taking care\r\nnot to let them burn. Peel them quickly, put them in a very hot\r\nvegetable-dish, either with or without a napkin, and serve very quickly.\r\nAfter potatoes are cooked, they should never be entirely covered up, as\r\nthe steam, instead of escaping, falls down on them, and makes them\r\nwatery and insipid. In Ireland they are usually served up with the skins\r\non, and a small plate is placed by the side of each guest.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Moderate-sized potatoes, with their skins on, 20 to 25 minutes\r\nafter the water boils; large potatoes, 25 minutes to 3/4 hour, or\r\nlonger; 5 minutes to dry them.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4s. per bushel. Sufficient for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but not good just before and whilst new\r\npotatoes are in season.\r\n\r\n    ANALYSIS OF THE POTATO.--Next to the cereals, the potato is the\r\n    most valuable plant for the production of human food. Its\r\n    tubers, according to analysis conducted by Mr. Fromberg, in the\r\n    laboratory of the Agricultural Chemical Association in Scotland,\r\n    contain the following ingredients:--75.52 per cent. of water,\r\n    15.72 starch, O.55 dextrine, 3.3 of impure saccharine matter,\r\n    and 3.25 of fibre with coagulated albumen. In a dried state the\r\n    tuber contains 64.2 per cent, of starch, 2.25 of dextrine, 13.47\r\n    of impure saccharine matter, 5.77 of caseine, gluten, and\r\n    albumen, 1 of fatty matter, and 13.31 of fibre with coagulated\r\n    albumen.\r\n\r\nTO BOIL NEW POTATOES.\r\n\r\n1139. INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes; to each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Do not have the potatoes dug long before they are dressed, as\r\nthey are never good when they have been out of the ground some time.\r\nWell wash them, rub off the skins with a coarse cloth, and put them into\r\n_boiling_ water salted in the above proportion. Let them boil until\r\ntender; try them with a fork, and when done, pour the water away from\r\nthem; let them stand by the side of the fire with the lid of the\r\nsaucepan partially uncovered, and when the potatoes are thoroughly dry,\r\nput them into a hot vegetable-dish, with a piece of butter the size of a\r\nwalnut; pile the potatoes over this, and serve. If the potatoes are too\r\nold to have the skins rubbed off, boil them in their jackets; drain,\r\npeel, and serve them as above, with a piece of butter placed in the\r\nmidst of them.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 to 1/2 hour, according to the size.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 1d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 3 lbs. for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in May and June, but may be had, forced, in March.\r\n\r\n    POTATO STARCH.--This fecula has a beautiful white crystalline\r\n    appearance, and is inodorous, soft to the touch, insoluble in\r\n    cold, but readily soluble in boiling water. It is on this starch\r\n    that the nutritive properties of the tubers depend. As an\r\n    aliment, it is well adapted for invalids and persons of delicate\r\n    constitution. It may be used in the form of arrow-root, and\r\n    eaten with milk or sugar. For pastry of all kinds it is more\r\n    light and easier of digestion than that made with flour of\r\n    wheat. In confectionery it serves to form creams and jellies,\r\n    and in cookery may be used to thicken soups and sauces. It\r\n    accommodates itself to the chest and stomach of children, for\r\n    whom it is well adapted; and it is an aliment that cannot be too\r\n    generally used, as much on account of its wholesomeness as its\r\n    cheapness, and the ease with which it is kept, which are equal,\r\n    if not superior, to all the much-vaunted exotic feculae; as,\r\n    salep, tapioca, sago, and arrow-root.\r\n\r\nTO STEAM POTATOES.\r\n\r\n1140. INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes; boiling water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--This mode of cooking potatoes is now much in vogue,\r\nparticularly where they are wanted on a large scale, it being so very\r\nconvenient. Pare the potatoes, throw them into cold water as they are\r\npeeled, then put them into a steamer. Place the steamer over a saucepan\r\nof boiling water, and steam the potatoes from 20 to 40 minutes,\r\naccording to the size and sort. When a fork goes easily through them,\r\nthey are done; then take them up, dish, and serve very quickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 to 40 minutes. _Average cost_, 4s. per bushel.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 2 large potatoes to each person.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ all the year, but not so good whilst new potatoes are in\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n    USES OF THE POTATO.--Potatoes boiled and beaten along with sour\r\n    milk form a sort of cheese, which is made in Saxony; and, when\r\n    kept in close vessels, may be preserved for several years. It is\r\n    generally supposed that the water in which potatoes are boiled\r\n    is injurious; and as instances are recorded where cattle having\r\n    drunk it were seriously affected, it may be well to err on the\r\n    safe side, and avoid its use for any alimentary purpose.\r\n    Potatoes which have been exposed to the air and become green,\r\n    are very unwholesome. Cadet de Vaux asserts that potatoes will\r\n    clean linen as well as soap; and it is well known that the\r\n    berries of the _S. saponaceum_ are used in Peru for the same\r\n    purpose.\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE COLD POTATOES.\r\n\r\n1141. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold potatoes; to every lb. allow 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of flour, 2 ditto of minced onions, 1 oz. of butter,\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mash the potatoes with a fork until perfectly free from lumps;\r\nstir in the other ingredients, and add sufficient milk to moisten them\r\nwell; press the potatoes into a mould, and bake in a moderate oven until\r\nnicely brown, which will be in from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour. Turn them\r\nout of the mould, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    POTATO BREAD.--The manner in which this is made is very simple.\r\n    The adhesive tendency of the flour of the potato acts against\r\n    its being baked or kneaded without being mixed with wheaten\r\n    flour or meal; it may, however, be made into cakes in the\r\n    following manner:--A small wooden frame, nearly square, is laid\r\n    on a pan like a frying-pan and is grooved, and so constructed\r\n    that, by means of a presser or lid introduced into the groove,\r\n    the cake is at once fashioned, according to the dimensions of\r\n    the mould. The frame containing the farina may be almost\r\n    immediately withdrawn after the mould is formed upon the pan;\r\n    because, from the consistency imparted to the incipient cake by\r\n    the heat, it will speedily admit of being safely handled: it\r\n    must not, however, be fried too hastily. It will then eat very\r\n    palatably, and might from time to time be soaked for puddings,\r\n    like tapioca, or might be used like the cassada-cake, for, when\r\n    well buttered and toasted, it will be found an excellent\r\n    accompaniment to breakfast. In Scotland, cold boiled potatoes\r\n    are frequently squeezed up and mixed with flour or oatmeal, and\r\n    an excellent cake, or _scon_, obtained.\r\n\r\nFRIED POTATOES (French Fashion).\r\n\r\n1142. INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes, hot butter or clarified dripping, salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel and cut the potatoes into thin slices, as nearly the same\r\nsize as possible; make some butter or dripping quite hot in a\r\nfrying-pan; put in the potatoes, and fry them on both sides of a nice\r\nbrown. When they are crisp and done, take them up, place them on a cloth\r\nbefore the fire to drain the grease from them, and serve very hot, after\r\nsprinkling them with salt. These are delicious with rump-steak, and, in\r\nFrance, are frequently served thus as a breakfast dish. The remains of\r\ncold potatoes may also be sliced and fried by the above recipe, but the\r\nslices must be cut a little thicker.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Sliced raw potatoes, 5 minutes; cooked potatoes, 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4s. per bushel.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--6 sliced potatoes for 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GERMAN METHOD OF COOKING POTATOES.\r\n\r\n1143. INGREDIENTS.--8 to 10 middling-sized potatoes, 3 oz. of butter, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of flour, 1/2 pint of broth, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the butter and flour into a stewpan; stir over the fire\r\nuntil the butter is of a nice brown colour, and add the broth and\r\nvinegar; peel and cut the potatoes into long thin slices, lay them in\r\nthe gravy, and let them simmer gently until tender, which will be in\r\nfrom 10 to 15 minutes, and serve very hot. A laurel-leaf simmered with\r\nthe potatoes is an improvement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    PRESERVING POTATOES.--In general, potatoes are stored or\r\n    preserved in pits, cellars, pies, or camps; but, whatever mode\r\n    is adopted, it is essential that the tubers be perfectly dry;\r\n    otherwise, they will surely rot; and a few rotten potatoes will\r\n    contaminate a whole mass. The pie, as it is called, consists of\r\n    a trench, lined and covered with straw; the potatoes in it being\r\n    piled in the shape of a house roof, to the height of about three\r\n    feet. The camps are shallow pits, filled and ridged up in a\r\n    similar manner, covered up with the excavated mould of the pit.\r\n    In Russia and Canada, the potato is preserved in boxes, in\r\n    houses or cellars, heated, when necessary, to a temperature one\r\n    or two degrees above the freezing-point, by stoves. To keep\r\n    potatoes for a considerable time, the best way is to place them\r\n    in thin layers on a platform suspended in an ice-cellar: there,\r\n    the temperature being always below that of active vegetation,\r\n    they will not sprout; while, not being above one or two degrees\r\n    below the freezing-point, the tubers will not be frostbitten.\r\n    Another mode is to scoop out the eyes with a very small scoop,\r\n    and keep the roots buried in earth; a third mode is to destroy\r\n    the vital principle, by kiln-drying, steaming, or scalding; a\r\n    fourth is to bury them so deep in dry soil, that no change of\r\n    temperature will reach them; and thus, being without air, they\r\n    will remain upwards of a year without vegetating.\r\n\r\nPOTATOES A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL.\r\n\r\n1144. INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes, salt and water; to every 6 potatoes allow\r\n1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to\r\ntaste, 4 tablespoonfuls of gravy, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the potatoes clean, and boil them in salt and water by\r\nrecipe No. 1138; when they are done, drain them, let them cool; then\r\npeel and cut the potatoes into thick slices: if these are too thin, they\r\nwould break in the sauce. Put the butter into a stewpan with the pepper,\r\nsalt, gravy, and parsley; mix these ingredients well together, put in\r\nthe potatoes, shake them two or three times, that they may be well\r\ncovered with the sauce, and, when quite hot through, squeeze in the\r\nlemon-juice, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour to boil the potatoes; 10 minutes for them to\r\nheat in the sauce.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4s. per bushel.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 persons. _Seasonable_ all the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASHED POTATOES.\r\n\r\n1145. INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes; to every lb. of mashed potatoes allow 1\r\noz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of milk, salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the potatoes in their skins; when done, drain them, and\r\nlet them get thoroughly dry by the side of the fire; then peel them,\r\nand, as they are peeled, put them into a clean saucepan, and with a\r\nlarge fork beat them to a light paste; add butter, milk, and salt in the\r\nabove proportion, and stir all the ingredients well over the fire. When\r\nthoroughly hot, dish them lightly, and draw the fork backwards over the\r\npotatoes to make the surface rough, and serve. When dressed in this\r\nmanner, they may be browned at the top with a salamander, or before the\r\nfire. Some cooks press the potatoes into moulds, then turn them out, and\r\nbrown them in the oven: this is a pretty mode of serving, but it makes\r\nthem heavy. In whatever way they are sent to table, care must be taken\r\nto have them quite free from lumps.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 1/2 to 3/4 hour to boil the potatoes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4s. per bushel.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--1 lb. of mashed potatoes for 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUREE DE POMMES DE TERRE, or, Very Thin-mashed Potatoes.\r\n\r\n1146. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of mashed potatoes allow 1/4 pint of\r\ngood broth or stock, 2 oz. of butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the potatoes, well drain them, and pound them smoothly in\r\na mortar, or beat them up with a fork; add the stock or broth, and rub\r\nthe potatoes through a sieve. Put the puree into a very clean saucepan\r\nwith the butter; stir it well over the fire until thoroughly hot, and it\r\nwill then be ready to serve. A puree should be rather thinner than\r\nmashed potatoes, and is a delicious accompaniment to delicately broiled\r\nmutton cutlets. Cream or milk may be substituted for the broth when the\r\nlatter is not at hand. A casserole of potatoes, which is often used for\r\nragoûts instead of rice, is made by mashing potatoes rather thickly,\r\nplacing them on a dish, and making an opening in the centre. After\r\nhaving browned the potatoes in the oven, the dish should be wiped clean,\r\nand the ragout or fricassée poured in.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/2 hour to boil the potatoes; 6 or 7 minutes to warm the\r\npurée.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4s. per bushel.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 lb. of cooked potatoes for 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWEET POTATO.]\r\n\r\n    VARIETIES OF THE POTATO.--These are very numerous. \"They\r\n    differ,\" says an authority, \"in their leaves and bulk of haulm;\r\n    in the colour of the skin of the tubers; in the colour of the\r\n    interior, compared with that of the skin; in the time of\r\n    ripening; in being farinaceous, glutinous, or watery; in tasting\r\n    agreeably or disagreeably; in cooking readily or tediously; in\r\n    the length of the subterraneous _stolones_ to which the tubers\r\n    are attached; in blossoming or not blossoming; and finally, in\r\n    the soil which they prefer.\" The earliest varieties grown in\r\n    fields are,--the Early Kidney, the Nonsuch, the Early Shaw, and\r\n    the Early Champion. This last is the most generally cultivated\r\n    round London: it is both mealy and hardy. The sweet potato is\r\n    but rarely eaten in Britain; but in America it is often served\r\n    at table, and is there very highly esteemed.\r\n\r\nPOTATO RISSOLES.\r\n\r\n1147. INGREDIENTS.--Mashed potatoes, salt and pepper to taste; when\r\nliked, a very little minced parsley, egg, and bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POTATO RISSOLES.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil and mash the potatoes by recipe No. 1145; add a seasoning\r\nof pepper and salt, and, when liked, a little minced parsley. Roll the\r\npotatoes into small balls, cover them with egg and bread crumbs, and fry\r\nin hot lard for about 10 minutes; let them drain before the fire, dish\r\nthem on a napkin, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_,--10 minutes to fry the rissoles.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The flavour of these rissoles may be very much increased by\r\nadding finely-minced tongue or ham, or even chopped onions, when these\r\nare liked.\r\n\r\n    QUALITIES OF POTATOES.--In making a choice from the many\r\n    varieties of potatoes which are everywhere found, the best way\r\n    is to get a sample and taste them, and then fix upon the kind\r\n    which best pleases your palate. The Shaw is one of the most\r\n    esteemed of the early potatoes for field culture; and the Kidney\r\n    and Bread-fruit are also good sorts. The Lancashire Pink is also\r\n    a good potato, and is much cultivated in the neighbourhood of\r\n    Liverpool. As late or long-keeping potatoes, the Tartan or\r\n    Red-apple stands very high in favour.\r\n\r\nPOTATO SNOW.\r\n\r\n1148. INGREDIENTS.--Potatoes, salt, and water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose large white potatoes, as free from spots as possible;\r\nboil them in their skins in salt and water until perfectly tender; drain\r\nand _dry them thoroughly_ by the side of the fire, and peel them. Put a\r\nhot dish before the fire, rub the potatoes through a coarse sieve on to\r\nthis dish; do not touch them afterwards, or the flakes will fall, and\r\nserve as hot as possible.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour to boil the potatoes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4s. per bushel.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--6 potatoes for 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    THE POTATO AS AN ARTICLE OF HUMAN FOOD.--This valuable esculent,\r\n    next to wheat, is of the greatest importance in the eye of the\r\n    political economist. From no other crop that can be cultivated\r\n    does the public derive so much benefit; and it has been\r\n    demonstrated that an acre of potatoes will feed double the\r\n    number of people that can be fed from an acre of wheat.\r\n\r\nTO DRESS SALSIFY.\r\n\r\n1149. INGREDIENTS.--Salsify; to each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt, 1 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Scrape the roots gently, so as to strip them only of their\r\noutside peel; cut them into pieces about 4 inches long, and, as they are\r\npeeled, throw them into water with which has been mixed a little\r\nlemon-juice, to prevent their discolouring. Put them into boiling water,\r\nwith salt, butter, and lemon-juice in the above proportion, and let them\r\nboil rapidly until tender; try them with a fork; and, when it penetrates\r\neasily, they are done. Drain the salsify, and serve with a good white\r\nsauce or French melted butter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--30 to 50 minutes. _Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This vegetable may be also boiled, sliced, and fried in batter\r\nof a nice brown. When crisp and a good colour, they should be served\r\nwith fried parsley in the centre of the dish, and a little fine salt\r\nsprinkled over the salsify.\r\n\r\n    SALSIFY.--This esculent is, for the sake of its roots,\r\n    cultivated in gardens. It belongs to the Composite class of\r\n    flowers, which is the most extensive family in the vegetable\r\n    kingdom. This family is not only one of the most natural and\r\n    most uniform in structure, but there is also a great similarity\r\n    existing in the properties of the plants of which it is\r\n    composed. Generally speaking, all composite flowers are tonic or\r\n    stimulant in their medical virtues.\r\n\r\nBOILED SEA-KALE.\r\n\r\n1150. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILED SEA-KALE.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Well wash the kale, cut away any wormeaten pieces, and tie it\r\ninto small bunches; put it into _boiling_ water, salted in the above\r\nproportion, and let it boil quickly until tender. Take it out, drain,\r\nuntie the bunches, and serve with plain melted butter or white sauce, a\r\nlittle of which may be poured over the kale. Sea-kale may also be\r\nparboiled and stewed in good brown gravy: it will then take about 1/2\r\nhour altogether.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 minutes; when liked very thoroughly done, allow an extra 5\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 9d. per basket.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 12 heads for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from February to June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEA-KALE.]\r\n\r\n    SEA-KALE.--This plant belongs to the Asparagus tribe, and grows\r\n    on seashores, especially in the West of England, and in the\r\n    neighbourhood of Dublin. Although it is now in very general use,\r\n    it did not come into repute till 1794. It is easily cultivated,\r\n    and is esteemed as one of the most valuable esculents indigenous\r\n    to Britain. As a vegetable, it is stimulating to the appetite,\r\n    easily digestible, and nutritious. It is so light that the most\r\n    delicate organizations may readily eat it. The flowers form a\r\n    favourite resort for bees, as their petals contain a great\r\n    amount of saccharine matter.\r\n\r\nBOILED SALAD.\r\n\r\n1151. INGREDIENTS.--2 heads of celery, 1 pint of French beans, lettuce,\r\nand endive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRENCH BEANS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHERVIL.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the celery and beans separately until tender, and cut the\r\ncelery into pieces about 2 inches long. Put these into a salad-bowl or\r\ndish; pour over either of the sauces No. 506, 507, or 508, and garnish\r\nthe dish with a little lettuce finely chopped, blanched endive, or a few\r\ntufts of boiled cauliflower. This composition, if less agreeable than\r\nvegetables in their raw state, is more wholesome; for salads, however\r\nthey may be compounded, when eaten uncooked, prove to some people\r\nindigestible. Tarragon, chervil, burnet, and boiled onion, may be added\r\nto the above salad with advantage, as also slices of cold meat, poultry,\r\nor fish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to October.\r\n\r\n    ACETARIOUS VEGETABLES.--By the term Acetarious vegetables, is\r\n    expressed a numerous class of plants, of various culture and\r\n    habit, which are principally used as salads, pickles, and\r\n    condiments. They are to be considered rather as articles of\r\n    comparative luxury than as ordinary food, and are more desirable\r\n    for their coolness, or their agreeable flavour, than for their\r\n    nutritive powers.\r\n\r\n    CAULIFLOWER.--The cauliflower is less indigestible than the\r\n    cabbage; it possesses a most agreeable flavour, and is\r\n    sufficiently delicate to be served at the tables of the wealthy.\r\n    It is a wholesome vegetable, but should be eaten moderately, as\r\n    it induces flatulence. Persons of weak constitutions and\r\n    delicate stomachs should abstain from cauliflower as much as\r\n    possible. They may be prepared in a variety of ways; and, in\r\n    selecting them, the whitest should be chosen; those tinged with\r\n    green or yellow being of indifferent quality.\r\n\r\nSUMMER SALAD.\r\n\r\n1152. INGREDIENTS.--3 lettuces, 2 handfuls of mustard-and-cress, 10\r\nyoung radishes, a few slices of cucumber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SALAD IN BOWL.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the herbs be as fresh as possible for a salad, and, if at\r\nall stale or dead-looking, let them lie in water for an hour or two,\r\nwhich will very much refresh them. Wash and carefully pick them over,\r\nremove any decayed or wormeaten leaves, and drain them thoroughly by\r\nswinging them gently in a clean cloth. With a silver knife, cut the\r\nlettuces into small pieces, and the radishes and cucumbers into thin\r\nslices; arrange all these ingredients lightly on a dish, with the\r\nmustard-and-cress, and pour under, but not over the salad, either of the\r\nsauces No. 506, 507, or 508, and do not stir it up until it is to be\r\neaten. It may be garnished with hard-boiled eggs, cut in slices, sliced\r\ncucumbers, nasturtiums, cut vegetable-flowers, and many other things\r\nthat taste will always suggest to make a pretty and elegant dish. In\r\nmaking a good salad, care must be taken to have the herbs freshly\r\ngathered, and _thoroughly drained_ before the sauce is added to them, or\r\nit will be watery and thin. Young spring onions, cut small, are by many\r\npersons considered an improvement to salads; but, before these are\r\nadded, the cook should always consult the taste of her employer. Slices\r\nof cold meat or poultry added to a salad make a convenient and\r\nquickly-made summer luncheon-dish; or cold fish, flaked, will also be\r\nfound exceedingly nice, mixed with it.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d. for a salad for 5 or 6 persons; but more expensive\r\nwhen the herbs are forced.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from May to September.\r\n\r\n    CUCUMBERS.--The cucumber is refreshing, but neither nutritious\r\n    nor digestible, and should be excluded from the regimen of the\r\n    delicate. There are various modes of preparing cucumbers. When\r\n    gathered young, they are called gherkins: these, pickled, are\r\n    much used in seasonings.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CUCUMBER-SLICE.]\r\n\r\n    RADISHES.--This is the common name given to the root of the\r\n    _Raphanus satious_, one of the varieties of the cultivated\r\n    horseradish. There are red and white radishes; and the French\r\n    have also what they call violet and black ones, of which the\r\n    black are the larger. Radishes are composed of nearly the same\r\n    constituents as turnips, that is to say, mostly fibre and\r\n    nitrogen; and, being generally eaten raw, it is on the last of\r\n    these that their flavour depends. They do not agree with people,\r\n    except those who are in good health, and have active digestive\r\n    powers; for they are difficult of digestion, and cause\r\n    flatulency and wind, and are the cause of headaches when eaten\r\n    to excess. Besides being eaten raw, they are sometimes, but\r\n    rarely, boiled; and they also serve as a pretty garnish for\r\n    salads. In China, the radish may be found growing naturally,\r\n    without cultivation; and may be occasionally met with in England\r\n    as a weed, in similar places to where the wild turnip grows; it,\r\n    however, thrives best in the garden, and the ground it likes\r\n    best is a deep open loam, or a well-manured sandy soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURNIP RADISHES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONG RADISHES.]\r\n\r\nWINTER SALAD.\r\n\r\n1153. INGREDIENTS.--Endive, mustard-and-cress, boiled beetroot, 3 or 4\r\nhard-boiled eggs, celery.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--The above ingredients form the principal constituents of a\r\nwinter salad, and may be converted into a very pretty dish, by nicely\r\ncontrasting the various colours, and by tastefully garnishing it. Shred\r\nthe celery into thin pieces, after having carefully washed and cut away\r\nall wormeaten pieces; cleanse the endive and mustard-and-cress free from\r\ngrit, and arrange these high in the centre of a salad-bowl or dish;\r\ngarnish with the hard-boiled eggs and beetroot, both of which should be\r\ncut in slices; and pour into the dish, but not over the salad, either of\r\nthe sauces No. 506, 507, or 508. Never dress a salad long before it is\r\nrequired for table, as, by standing, it loses its freshness and pretty\r\ncrisp and light appearance; the sauce, however, may always be prepared a\r\nfew hours beforehand, and when required for use, the herbs laid lightly\r\nover it.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d. for a salad for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the end of September to March.\r\n\r\n    SALADS.--Salads are raw vegetables, of which, among us, the\r\n    lettuce is the most generally used; several others, however,\r\n    such as cresses, celery, onions, beetroot, &c., are occasionally\r\n    employed. As vegetables eaten in a raw state are apt to ferment\r\n    on the stomach, and as they have very little stimulative power\r\n    upon that organ, they are usually dressed with some condiments,\r\n    such as pepper, vinegar, salt, mustard, and oil. Respecting the\r\n    use of these, medical men disagree, especially in reference to\r\n    oil, which is condemned by some and recommended by others.\r\n\r\nPOTATO SALAD.\r\n\r\n1154. INGREDIENTS.--10 or 12 cold boiled potatoes, 4 tablespoonfuls of\r\ntarragon or plain vinegar, 6 tablespoonfuls of salad-oil, pepper and\r\nsalt to taste, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the potatoes into slices about 1/2 inch in thickness; put\r\nthese into a salad-bowl with oil and vinegar in the above proportion;\r\nseason with pepper, salt, and a teaspoonful of minced parsley; stir the\r\nsalad well, that all the ingredients may be thoroughly incorporated, and\r\nit is ready to serve. This should be made two or three hours before it\r\nis wanted for table. Anchovies, olives, or pickles may be added to this\r\nsalad, as also slices of cold beef, fowl, or turkey.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\nCHICKEN SALAD.--(See No. 931.)\r\n\r\nGROUSE SALAD.--(See No. 1020.)\r\n\r\nLOBSTER SALAD.--(See No. 272.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BOIL SPINACH (English Mode).\r\n\r\n1155. INGREDIENTS.--2 pailfuls of spinach, 2 heaped tablespoonfuls of\r\nsalt, 1 oz. of butter, pepper to taste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPINACH GARNISHED WITH CROÛTONS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the spinach carefully, and see that no stalks or weeds are\r\nleft amongst it; wash it in several waters, and, to prevent it being\r\ngritty, act in the following manner:--Have ready two large pans or tubs\r\nfilled with water; put the spinach into one of these, and thoroughly\r\nwash it; then, _with the hands_, take out the spinach, and put it into\r\nthe _other tub_ of water (by this means all the grit will be left at the\r\nbottom of the tub); wash it again, and, should it not be perfectly free\r\nfrom dirt, repeat the process. Put it into a very large saucepan, with\r\nabout 1/2 pint of water, just sufficient to keep the spinach from\r\nburning, and the above proportion of salt. Press it down frequently with\r\na wooden spoon, that it may be done equally; and when it has boiled for\r\nrather more than 10 minutes, or until it is perfectly tender, drain it\r\nin a colander, squeeze it quite dry, and chop it finely. Put the spinach\r\ninto a clean stewpan, with the butter and a seasoning of pepper; stir\r\nthe whole over the fire until quite hot; then put it on a hot dish, and\r\ngarnish with sippets of toasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes to boil the spinach, 5 minutes to warm with\r\nthe butter.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for the above quantity, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Spring spinach from March to July; winter spinach from\r\nNovember to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Grated nutmeg, pounded mace, or lemon-juice may also be added\r\nto enrich the flavour; and poached eggs are also frequently served with\r\nspinach: they should be placed on the top of it, and it should be\r\ngarnished with sippets of toasted bread.--See coloured plate U.\r\n\r\n    VARIETIES OF SPINACH.--These comprise the Strawberry spinach,\r\n    which, under that name, was wont to be grown in our\r\n    flower-gardens; the Good King Harry, the Garden Oracle, the\r\n    Prickly, and the Round, are the varieties commonly used. The\r\n    Oracle is a hardy sort, much esteemed in France, and is a native\r\n    of Tartary, introduced in 1548. The common spinach has its\r\n    leaves round, and is softer and more succulent than any of the\r\n    Brassica tribe.\r\n\r\nSPINACH DRESSED WITH CREAM, a la Francaise.\r\n\r\n1156. INGREDIENTS.--2 pailfuls of spinach, 2 tablespoonfuls of salt, 2\r\noz. of butter, 8 tablespoonfuls of cream, 1 small teaspoonful of pounded\r\nsugar, a very little grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil and drain the spinach as in recipe No. 1155; chop it\r\nfinely, and put it into a stewpan with the butter; stir over a gentle\r\nfire, and, when the butter has dried away, add the remaining\r\ningredients, and simmer for about 5 minutes. Previously to adding the\r\ncream, boil it first, in case it should curdle. Serve on a hot dish, and\r\ngarnish either with sippets of toasted bread or leaves of puff-paste.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes to boil the spinach; 10 minutes to stew with\r\nthe cream.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for the above quantity, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Spring spinach from March to July; winter spinach from\r\nNovember to March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPINACH.]\r\n\r\n    SPINACH.--This is a Persian plant. It has been cultivated in our\r\n    gardens about two hundred years, and is the most wholesome of\r\n    vegetables. It is not very nutritious, but is very easily\r\n    digested. It is very light and laxative. Wonderful properties\r\n    have been ascribed to spinach. It is an excellent vegetable, and\r\n    very beneficial to health. Plainly dressed, it is a resource for\r\n    the poor; prepared luxuriantly, it is a choice dish for the\r\n    rich.\r\n\r\n    SPINACH.--This vegetable belongs to a sub-order of the\r\n    _Salsolaceae_, or saltworts, and is classified under the head of\r\n    _Spirolobeae_, with leaves shaped like worms, and of a succulent\r\n    kind. In its geographical distribution it is commonly found in\r\n    extratropical and temperate regions, where they grow as weeds in\r\n    waste places, and among rubbish, and in marshes by the seashore.\r\n    In the tropics the order is rarely found. Many of them are used\r\n    as potherbs, and some of them are emetic and vermifuge in their\r\n    medicinal properties.\r\n\r\nFRENCH MODE OF DRESSING SPINACH.\r\n\r\n1157. INGREDIENTS.--2 pailfuls of spinach, 2 tablespoonfuls of salt, 2\r\noz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of flour, 8 tablespoonfuls of good gravy;\r\nwhen liked, a very little grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick, wash, and boil the spinach, as in recipe No. 1155, and\r\nwhen quite tender, drain and squeeze it perfectly dry from the water\r\nthat hangs about it. Chop it very fine, put the butter into a stewpan,\r\nand lay the spinach over that; stir it over a gentle fire, and dredge in\r\nthe flour. Add the gravy, and let it boil _quickly_ for a few minutes,\r\nthat it may not discolour. When the flavour of nutmeg is liked, grate\r\nsome to the spinach, and when thoroughly hot, and the gravy has dried\r\naway a little, serve. Garnish the dish with sippets of toasted bread.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes to boil the spinach; 10 minutes to simmer in\r\nthe gravy.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for the above quantity, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Spring spinach from March to July; winter spinach from\r\nOctober to February.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--For an entremets or second-course dish, spinach, dressed by the\r\nabove recipe may be pressed into a hot mould; it should then be turned\r\nout quickly, and served very hot.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED TOMATOES.\r\n\r\n(_Excellent_.)\r\n\r\n1158. INGREDIENTS.--8 or 10 tomatoes, pepper and salt to taste, 2 oz. of\r\nbutter, bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take off the stalks from the tomatoes; cut them into thick\r\nslices, and put them into a deep baking-dish; add a plentiful seasoning\r\nof pepper and salt, and butter in the above proportion; cover the whole\r\nwith bread crumbs; drop over these a little clarified butter; bake in a\r\nmoderate oven from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour, and serve very hot. This\r\nvegetable, dressed as above, is an exceedingly nice accompaniment to all\r\nkinds of roast meat. The tomatoes, instead of being cut in slices, may\r\nbe baked whole; but they will take rather longer time to cook.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 9d. per basket.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in August, September, and October; but may be had, forced,\r\nmuch earlier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOMATO.]\r\n\r\n    TOMATOES.--The Tomato is a native of tropical countries, but is\r\n    now cultivated considerably both in France and England. Its skin\r\n    is of a brilliant red, and its flavour, which is somewhat sour,\r\n    has become of immense importance in the culinary art. It is used\r\n    both fresh and preserved. When eaten fresh, it is served as an\r\n    _entremets_; but its principal use is in sauce and gravy; its\r\n    flavour stimulates the appetite, and is almost universally\r\n    approved. The Tomato is a wholesome fruit, and digests easily.\r\n    From July to September, they gather the tomatoes green in\r\n    France, not breaking them away from the stalk; they are then\r\n    hung, head downwards, in a dry and not too cold place; and there\r\n    they ripen.\r\n\r\nHOT TOMATO SAUCE, or PUREE OF TOMATOES.\r\n\r\n(See No. 529.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEWED TOMATOES.]\r\n\r\nSTEWED TOMATOES.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n1159. INGREDIENTS.--8 tomatoes, pepper and salt to taste, 2 oz. of\r\nbutter, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice the tomatoes into a _lined_ saucepan; season them with\r\npepper and salt, and place small pieces of butter on them. Cover the lid\r\ndown closely, and stew from 20 to 25 minutes, or until the tomatoes are\r\nperfectly tender; add the vinegar, stir two or three times, and serve\r\nwith any kind of roast meat, with which they will be found a delicious\r\naccompaniment.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 to 25 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 9d. per basket.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to October; but may be had, forced, much\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n    ANALYSIS OF THE TOMATO.--The fruit of the love-apple is the only\r\n    part used as an esculent, and it has been found to contain a\r\n    particular acid, a volatile oil, a brown, very fragrant\r\n    extracto-resinous matter, a vegeto-mineral matter,\r\n    muco-saccharine, some salts, and, in all probability, an\r\n    alkaloid. The whole plant has a disagreeable odour, and its\r\n    juice, subjected to the action of the fire, emits a vapour so\r\n    powerful as to cause vertigo and vomiting.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n1160. INGREDIENTS.--8 tomatoes, about 1/2 pint of good gravy, thickening\r\nof butter and flour, cayenne and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take out the stalks of the tomatoes; put them into a wide\r\nstewpan, pour over them the above proportion of good brown gravy, and\r\nstew gently until they are tender, occasionally _carefully_ turning\r\nthem, that they may be equally done. Thicken the gravy with a little\r\nbutter and flour worked together on a plate; let it just boil up after\r\nthe thickening is added, and serve. If it be at hand, these should be\r\nserved on a silver or plated vegetable-dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 to 25 minutes, very gentle stewing.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 9d. per basket.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in August, September, and October; but maybe had, forced,\r\nmuch earlier.\r\n\r\n    THE TOMATO, OR LOVE-APPLE.--This vegetable is a native of Mexico\r\n    and South America, but is also found in the East Indies, where\r\n    it is supposed to have been introduced by the Spaniards. In this\r\n    country it is much more cultivated than it formerly was; and the\r\n    more the community becomes acquainted with the many agreeable\r\n    forms in which the fruit can be prepared, the more widely will\r\n    its cultivation be extended. For ketchup, soups, and sauces, it\r\n    is equally applicable, and the unripe fruit makes one of the\r\n    best pickles.\r\n\r\nTRUFFLES AU NATUREL.\r\n\r\n1161. INGREDIENTS.--Truffles, buttered paper.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Select some fine truffles; cleanse them, by washing them in\r\nseveral waters with a brush, until not a particle of sand or grit\r\nremains on them; wrap each truffle in buttered paper, and bake in a hot\r\noven for quite an hour; take off the paper, wipe the truffles, and serve\r\nthem in a hot napkin.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_.--Not often bought in this country.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRUFFLES.]\r\n\r\n    THE COMMON TRUFFLE.--This is the _Tuber cibarium_ of science,\r\n    and belongs to that numerous class of esculent fungi\r\n    distinguished from other vegetables not only by the singularity\r\n    of their forms, but by their chemical composition. Upon\r\n    analysis, they are found not only to contain the usual\r\n    components of the vegetable kingdom, such as carbon, oxygen, and\r\n    hydrogen, but likewise a large proportion of nitrogen; from\r\n    which they approach more nearly to the nature of animal flesh.\r\n    It was long ago observed by Dr. Darwin, that all the mushrooms\r\n    cooked at our tables, as well as those used for ketchup,\r\n    possessed an animal flavour; and soup enriched by mushrooms only\r\n    has sometimes been supposed to contain meat.\r\n\r\nTO DRESS TRUFFLES WITH CHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n1162. INGREDIENTS.--12 fine black truffles, a few slices of fat bacon, 1\r\ncarrot, 1 turnip, 2 onions, a bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley,\r\n1 bay-leaf, 2 cloves, 1 blade of pounded mace, 2 glasses of champagne,\r\n1/2 pint of stock.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Carefully select the truffles, reject those that have a musty\r\nsmell, and wash them well with a brush, in cold water only, until\r\nperfectly clean. Put the bacon into a stewpan, with the truffles and the\r\nremaining ingredients; simmer these gently for an hour, and let the\r\nwhole cool in the stewpan. When to be served, rewarm them, and drain\r\nthem on a clean cloth; then arrange them on a delicately white napkin,\r\nthat it may contrast as strongly as possible with the truffles, and\r\nserve. The trimmings of truffles are used to flavour gravies, stock,\r\nsauces, &c.; and are an excellent addition to ragouts, made dishes of\r\nfowl, &c.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_.--Not often bought in this country.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n    THE TRUFFLE.--The Truffle belongs to the family of the Mushroom.\r\n    It is certain that the truffle must possess, equally with other\r\n    plants, organs of reproduction; yet, notwithstanding all the\r\n    efforts of art and science, it has been impossible to subject it\r\n    to a regular culture. Truffles grow at a considerable depth\r\n    under the earth, never appearing on the surface. They are found\r\n    in many parts of France: those of Périgord Magny are the most\r\n    esteemed for their odour. There are three varieties of the\r\n    species,--the black, the red, and the white: the latter are of\r\n    little value. The red are very rare, and their use is\r\n    restricted. The black has the highest repute, and its\r\n    consumption is enormous. When the peasantry go to gather\r\n    truffles, they take a pig with them to scent out the spot where\r\n    they grow. When that is found, the pig turns up the surface with\r\n    his snout, and the men then dig until they find the truffles.\r\n    Good truffles are easily distinguished by their agreeable\r\n    perfume; they should be light in proportion to their size, and\r\n    elastic when pressed by the finger. To have them in perfection,\r\n    they should be quite fresh, as their aroma is considerably\r\n    diminished by any conserving process. Truffles are stimulating\r\n    and beating. Weak stomachs digest them with difficulty. Some of\r\n    the culinary uses to which they are subjected render them more\r\n    digestible; but they should always be eaten sparingly. Their\r\n    chief use is in seasoning and garnitures. In short, a professor\r\n    has said, \"Meats with truffles are the most distinguished dishes\r\n    that opulence can offer to the epicure.\" The Truffle grows in\r\n    clusters, some inches below the surface of the soil, and is of\r\n    an irregular globular form. Those which grow wild in England are\r\n    about the size of a hen's egg, and have no roots. As there is\r\n    nothing to indicate the places where they are, dogs have been\r\n    trained to discriminate their scent, by which they are\r\n    discovered. Hogs are very fond of them, and frequently lead to\r\n    their being found, from their rutting up the ground in search of\r\n    them.\r\n\r\nITALIAN MODE OF DRESSING TRUFFLES.\r\n\r\n1163. INGREDIENTS.--10 truffles, 1/4 pint of salad-oil, pepper and salt\r\nto taste, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, a very little finely-minced\r\ngarlic, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--After cleansing and brushing the truffles, cut them into thin\r\nslices, and put them in a baking-dish, on a seasoning of oil, pepper,\r\nsalt, parsley, garlic, and mace in the above proportion. Bake them for\r\nnearly an hour, and, just before serving, add the lemon-juice, and send\r\nthem to table very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Nearly 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_.--Not often bought in this country.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n    WHERE TRUFFLES ARE FOUND.--In this country, the common truffle\r\n    is found on the downs of Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Kent; and\r\n    they abound in dry light soils, and more especially in oak and\r\n    chestnut forests. In France they are plentiful, and many are\r\n    imported from the south of that country and Italy, where they\r\n    are much larger and in greater perfection: they lose, however,\r\n    much of their flavour by drying. Truffles have in England been\r\n    tried to be propagated artificially, but without success.\r\n\r\nTRUFFLES A L'ITALIENNE.\r\n\r\n1164. INGREDIENTS.--10 truffles, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 1\r\nminced shalot, salt and pepper to taste, 2 oz. of butter, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of good brown gravy, the juice of 1/2 lemon, cayenne to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the truffles and cut them into slices about the size of a\r\npenny-piece; put them into a sauté pan, with the parsley, shalot, salt,\r\npepper, and 1 oz. of butter; stir them over the fire, that they may all\r\nbe equally done, which will be in about 10 minutes, and drain off some\r\nof the butter; then add a little more fresh butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\ngood gravy, the juice of 1/2 lemon, and a little cayenne; stir over the\r\nfire until the whole is on the point of boiling, when serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_.--Not often bought in this country.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to March.\r\n\r\n    USES OF THE TRUFFLE.--Like the Morel, truffles are seldom eaten\r\n    alone, but are much used in gravies, soups, and ragoûts. They\r\n    are likewise dried for the winter months, and, when reduced to\r\n    powder, form a useful culinary ingredient; they, however, have\r\n    many virtues attributed to them which they do not possess. Their\r\n    wholesomeness is, perhaps, questionable, and they should be\r\n    eaten with moderation.\r\n\r\nBOILED TURNIPS.\r\n\r\n1165. INGREDIENTS.--Turnips; to each 1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare the turnips, and, should they be very large, divide them\r\ninto quarters; but, unless this is the case, let them be cooked whole.\r\nPut them into a saucepan of boiling water, salted in the above\r\nproportion, and let them boil gently until tender. Try them with a fork,\r\nand, when done, take them up in a colander; let them thoroughly drain,\r\nand serve. Boiled turnips are usually sent to table with boiled mutton,\r\nbut are infinitely nicer when mashed than served whole: unless nice and\r\nyoung, they are scarcely worth the trouble of dressing plainly as above.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Old turnips, 3/4 to 1-1/4 hour; young ones, about 18 to 20\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d. per bunch.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow a bunch of 12 turnips for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--May be had all the year; but in spring only useful for\r\nflavouring gravies, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURNIPS.]\r\n\r\n    THE TURNIP.--This vegetable is the _Brassica Rapa_ of science,\r\n    and grows wild in England, but cannot be brought exactly to\r\n    resemble what it becomes in a cultivated state. It is said to\r\n    have been originally introduced from Hanover, and forms an\r\n    excellent culinary vegetable, much used all over Europe, where\r\n    it is either eaten alone or mashed and cooked in soups and\r\n    stews. They do not thrive in a hot climate; for in India they,\r\n    and many more of our garden vegetables, lose their flavour and\r\n    become comparatively tasteless. The Swede is the largest\r\n    variety, but it is too coarse for the table.\r\n\r\nMASHED TURNIPS.\r\n\r\n1166. INGREDIENTS.--10 or 12 large turnips; to each 1/2 gallon of water\r\nallow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, 2 oz. of butter, cayenne or white\r\npepper to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare the turnips, quarter them, and put them into boiling\r\nwater, salted in the above proportion; boil them until tender; then\r\ndrain them in a colander, and squeeze them as dry as possible by\r\npressing them with the back of a large plate. When quite free from\r\nwater, rub the turnips with a wooden spoon through the colander, and put\r\nthem into a very clean saucepan; add the butter, white pepper, or\r\ncayenne, and, if necessary, a little salt. Keep stirring them over the\r\nfire until the butter is well mixed with them, and the turnips are\r\nthoroughly hot; dish, and serve. A little cream or milk added after the\r\nturnips are pressed through the colander, is an improvement to both the\r\ncolour and flavour of this vegetable.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 1/2 to 3/4 hour to boil the turnips; 10 minutes to warm\r\nthem through.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d. per bunch.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--May be had all the year; but in spring only good for\r\nflavouring gravies.\r\n\r\n    VEGETABLES REDUCED TO PURÉE.--Persons in the flower of youth,\r\n    having healthy stomachs, and leading active lives, may eat all\r\n    sorts of vegetables, without inconvenience, save, of course, in\r\n    excess. The digestive functions possess great energy during the\r\n    period of youth: the body, to develop itself, needs nourishment.\r\n    Physical exercise gives an appetite, which it is necessary to\r\n    satisfy, and vegetables cannot resist the vigorous action of the\r\n    gastric organs. As old proverb says, \"At twenty one can digest\r\n    iron.\" But for aged persons, the sedentary, or the delicate, it\r\n    is quite otherwise. Then the gastric power has considerably\r\n    diminished, the digestive organs have lost their energy, the\r\n    process of digestion is consequently slower, and the least\r\n    excess at table is followed by derangement of the stomach for\r\n    several days. Those who generally digest vegetables with\r\n    difficulty, should eat them reduced to a pulp or purée, that is\r\n    to say, with their skins and tough fibres removed. Subjected to\r\n    this process, vegetables which, when entire, would create\r\n    flatulence and wind, are then comparatively harmless. Experience\r\n    has established the rule, that nourishment is not complete\r\n    without the alliance of meat with vegetables. We would also add,\r\n    that the regime most favourable to health is found in variety:\r\n    variety pleases the senses, monotony is disagreeable. The eye is\r\n    fatigued by looking always on one object, the ear by listening\r\n    to one sound, and the palate by tasting one flavour. It is the\r\n    same with the stomach: consequently, variety of food is one of\r\n    the essentials for securing good digestion.\r\n\r\nGERMAN MODE OF COOKING TURNIPS.\r\n\r\n1167. INGREDIENTS.--8 large turnips, 3 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to\r\ntaste, rather more than 1/2 pint of weak stock or broth, 1 tablespoonful\r\nof flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the butter hot in a stewpan, lay in the turnips, after\r\nhaving pared and cut them into dice, and season them with pepper and\r\nsalt. Toss them over the fire for a few minutes, then add the broth, and\r\nsimmer the whole gently till the turnips are tender. Brown the above\r\nproportion of flour with a little butter; add this to the turnips, let\r\nthem simmer another 5 minutes, and serve. Boiled mutton is usually sent\r\nto table with this vegetable, and may be cooked with the turnips by\r\nplacing it in the midst of them: the meat would then be very delicious,\r\nas, there being so little liquid with the turnips, it would almost be\r\nsteamed, and consequently very tender.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes. _Average cost_, 4d. per bunch.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--May be had all the year.\r\n\r\n    TURNIPS.--Good turnips are delicate in texture, firm, and sweet.\r\n    The best sorts contain a sweet juicy mucilage, uniting with the\r\n    aroma a slightly acid quality, which is completely neutralized\r\n    in cooking. The turnip is prepared in a variety of ways. Ducks\r\n    stuffed with turnips have been highly appreciated. It is useful\r\n    in the regimen of persons afflicted with chronic visceral\r\n    irritations. The turnip only creates flatulency when it is soft,\r\n    porous, and stringy. It is then, consequently, bad.\r\n\r\nTURNIPS IN WHITE SAUCE.\r\n\r\n(An Entremets, or to be served with the Second Course as a Side-dish.)\r\n\r\n1168. INGREDIENTS.--7 or 8 turnips, 1 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint of white\r\nsauce, No. 538 or 539.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel and cut the turnips in the shape of pears or marbles; boil\r\nthem in salt and water, to which has been added a little butter, until\r\ntender; then take them out, drain, arrange them on a dish, and pour over\r\nthe white sauce made by recipe No. 538 or 539, and to which has been\r\nadded a small lump of sugar. In winter, when other vegetables are\r\nscarce, this will be found a very good and pretty-looking dish: when\r\napproved, a little mustard may be added to the sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3/4 hour to boil the turnips.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d. per bunch.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 side-dish. _Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n    THE FRENCH NAVET.--This is a variety of the turnip; but, instead\r\n    of being globular, has more the shape of the carrot. Its flavour\r\n    being excellent, it is much esteemed on the Continent for soups\r\n    and made dishes. Two or three of them will impart as much\r\n    flavour as a dozen of the common turnips will. Accordingly, when\r\n    stewed in gravy, they are greatly relished. This flavour resides\r\n    in the rind, which is not cut off, but scraped. This variety was\r\n    once grown in England, but now it is rarely found in our\r\n    gardens, though highly deserving of a place there. It is of a\r\n    yellowish-white colour, and is sometimes imported to the London\r\n    market.\r\n\r\nBOILED TURNIP GREENS.\r\n\r\n1169. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water, allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt; turnip-greens.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the greens well in two or three waters, and pick off all\r\nthe decayed and dead leaves; tie them in small bunches, and put them\r\ninto plenty of boiling water, salted in the above proportion. Keep them\r\nboiling quickly, with the lid of the saucepan uncovered, and when\r\ntender, pour them into a colander; let them drain, arrange them in a\r\nvegetable-dish, remove the string that the greens were tied with, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 to 20 minutes. _Average cost_, 4d. for a dish for 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in March, April, and May.\r\n\r\n    CABBAGE, TURNIP-TOPS, AND GREENS.--All the cabbage tribe, which\r\n    comprises coleworts, brocoli, cauliflower, sprouts, and\r\n    turnip-tops, in order to be delicate, should be dressed young,\r\n    when they have a rapid growth; but, if they have stood the\r\n    summer, in order to be tender, they should be allowed to have a\r\n    touch of frost. The cabbage contains much vegetable albumen, and\r\n    several parts sulphur and nitrate of potass. Cabbage is heavy,\r\n    and a long time digesting, which has led to a belief that it is\r\n    very nourishing. It is only fit food for robust and active\r\n    persons; the sedentary or delicate should carefully avoid it.\r\n    Cabbage may be prepared in a variety of ways: it serves as a\r\n    garniture to several recherché dishes,--partridge and cabbage\r\n    for example. Bacon and cabbage is a very favourite dish; but\r\n    only a good stomach can digest it.\r\n\r\nBOILED VEGETABLE MARROW.\r\n\r\n1170. INGREDIENTS.--To each 1/2 gallon of water, allow 1 heaped\r\ntablespoonful of salt; vegetable marrows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE MARROW ON TOAST.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, salted in the above\r\nproportion; put in the marrows after peeling them, and boil them until\r\nquite tender. Take them up with a slice, halve, and, should they be very\r\nlarge, quarter them. Dish them on toast, and send to table with them a\r\ntureen of melted butter, or, in lieu of this, a small pat of salt\r\nbutter. Large vegetable marrows may be preserved throughout the winter\r\nby storing them in a dry place; when wanted for use, a few slices should\r\nbe cut and boiled in the same manner as above; but, when once begun, the\r\nmarrow must be eaten quickly, as it keeps but a short time after it is\r\ncut. Vegetable marrows are also very delicious mashed: they should be\r\nboiled, then drained, and mashed smoothly with a wooden spoon. Heat them\r\nin a saucepan, add a seasoning of salt and pepper, and a small piece of\r\nbutter, and dish with a few sippets of toasted bread placed round as a\r\ngarnish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Young vegetable marrows 10 to 20 minutes; old ones, 1/2 to 3/4\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 1s. per dozen.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 moderate-sized marrow for each person.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July, August, and September; but may be preserved all\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED VEGETABLE MARROW.\r\n\r\n1171. INGREDIENTS.--3 medium-sized vegetable marrows, egg and bread\r\ncrumbs, hot lard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel, and boil the marrows until tender in salt and water; then\r\ndrain them and cut them in quarters, and take out the seeds. When\r\nthoroughly drained, brush the marrows over with egg, and sprinkle with\r\nbread crumbs; have ready some hot lard, fry the marrow in this, and,\r\nwhen of a nice brown, dish; sprinkle over a little salt and pepper, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/2 hour to boil the marrow, 7 minutes to fry it.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 1s. per dozen.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July, August, and September.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE MARROW.]\r\n\r\n    THE VEGETABLE MARROW.--This vegetable is now extensively used,\r\n    and belongs to the Cucurbits. It is the _C. ovifera_ of science,\r\n    and, like the melon, gourd, cucumber, and squash, is widely\r\n    diffused in the tropical or warmer regions of the globe. Of the\r\n    nature of this family we have already spoken when treating of\r\n    the cucumber.\r\n\r\nCUT VEGETABLES FOR SOUPS, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE-CUTTER.]\r\n\r\n1172. The annexed engraving represents a cutter for shaping vegetables\r\nfor soups, ragouts, stews, &c.; carrots and turnips being the usual\r\nvegetables for which this utensil is used. Cut the vegetables into\r\nslices about 1/4 inch in thickness, stamp them out with the cutter, and\r\nboil them for a few minutes in salt and water, until tender. Turnips\r\nshould be cut in rather thicker slices than carrots, on account of the\r\nformer boiling more quickly to a pulp than the latter.\r\n\r\n    CARROTS.--Several species of carrots are cultivated,--the red,\r\n    the yellow, and the which. Those known as the Crecy carrots are\r\n    considered the best, and are very sweet. The carrot has been\r\n    classed by hygienists among flatulent vegetables, and as\r\n    difficult of digestion. When the root becomes old, it is almost\r\n    as hard as wood; but the young carrot, which has not reached its\r\n    full growth, is tender, relishing, nutritious, and digests well\r\n    when properly cooked.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE MARROWS IN WHITE SAUCE.\r\n\r\n1173. INGREDIENTS.--4 or 5 moderate-sized marrows, 1/2 pint of white\r\nsauce, No. 539.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE MARROW IN WHITE SAUCE.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare the marrows; cut them in halves, and shape each half at\r\nthe top in a point, leaving the bottom end flat for it to stand upright\r\nin the dish. Boil the marrows in salt and water until tender; take them\r\nup very carefully, and arrange them on a hot dish. Have ready 1/2 pint\r\nof white sauce, made by recipe No. 539; pour this over the marrows, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 15 to 20 minutes to boil the marrows.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 1s. per dozen.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July, August, and September.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED INDIAN WHEAT or MAIZE.\r\n\r\n1174. INGREDIENTS.--The ears of young and green Indian wheat; to every\r\n1/2 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--This vegetable, which makes one of the most delicious dishes\r\nbrought to table, is unfortunately very rarely seen in Britain; and we\r\nwonder that, in the gardens of the wealthy, it is not invariably\r\ncultivated. Our sun, it is true, possesses hardly power sufficient to\r\nripen maize; but, with well-prepared ground, and in a favourable\r\nposition, it might be sufficiently advanced by the beginning of autumn\r\nto serve as a vegetable. The outside sheath being taken off and the\r\nwaving fibres removed, let the ears be placed in boiling water, where\r\nthey should remain for about 25 minutes (a longer time may be necessary\r\nfor larger ears than ordinary); and, when sufficiently boiled and well\r\ndrained, they may be sent to table whole, and with a piece of toast\r\nunderneath them. Melted butter should be served with them.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--25 to 35 minutes. _Average cost_.--Seldom bought.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--1 ear for each person. _Seasonable_ in autumn.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--William Cobbett, the English radical writer and politician, was\r\na great cultivator and admirer of maize, and constantly ate it as a\r\nvegetable, boiled. We believe he printed a special recipe for it, but we\r\nhave been unable to lay our hands on it. Mr. Buchanan, the present\r\npresident of the United States, was in the habit, when ambassador here,\r\nof receiving a supply of Indian corn from America in hermetically-sealed\r\ncases; and the publisher of this work remembers, with considerable\r\nsatisfaction, his introduction to a dish of this vegetable, when in\r\nAmerica. He found it to combine the excellences of the young green pea\r\nand the finest asparagus; but he felt at first slightly awkward in\r\nholding the large ear with one hand, whilst the other had to be employed\r\nin cutting off with a knife the delicate green grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PUDDINGS AND PASTRY.\r\n\r\n1175. PUDDINGS AND PASTRY, familiar as they may be, and unimportant as\r\nthey may be held in the estimation of some, are yet intimately connected\r\nwith the development of agricultural resources in reference to the\r\ncereal grasses. When they began to be made is uncertain; but we may\r\nsafely presume, that a simple form of pudding was amongst the first\r\ndishes made after discovering a mode of grinding wheat into flour.\r\nTraditional history enables us to trace man back to the time of the\r\nDeluge. After that event he seems to have recovered himself in the\r\ncentral parts of Asia, and to have first risen to eminence in the arts\r\nof civilization on the banks of the Nile. From this region, Greece,\r\nCarthage, and some other parts along the shores of the Mediterranean\r\nSea, were colonized. In process of time, Greece gave to the Romans the\r\narts which she had thus received from Egypt, and these subsequently\r\ndiffused them over Europe. How these were carried to or developed in\r\nIndia and China, is not so well ascertained; and in America their\r\nancient existence rests only on very indistinct traditions. As to who\r\nwas the real discoverer of the use of corn, we have no authentic\r\nknowledge. The traditions of different countries ascribe it to various\r\nfabulous personages, whose names it is here unnecessary to introduce. In\r\nEgypt, however, corn must have grown abundantly; for Abraham, and after\r\nhim Jacob, had recourse to that country for supplies during times of\r\nfamine.\r\n\r\n1176. THE HABITS OF A PEOPLE, to a great extent, are formed by the\r\nclimate in which they live, and by the native or cultivated productions\r\nin which their country abounds. Thus we find that the agricultural\r\nproduce of the ancient Egyptians is pretty much the same as that of the\r\npresent day, and the habits of the people are not materially altered. In\r\nGreece, the products cultivated in antiquity were the same kinds of\r\ngrains and legumes as are cultivated at present, with the vine, the fig,\r\nthe olive, the apple, and other fruits. So with the Romans, and so with\r\nother nations. As to the different modes of artificially preparing those\r\nto please the taste, it is only necessary to say that they arise from\r\nthe universal desire of novelty, characteristic of man in the\r\ndevelopment of his social conditions. Thus has arisen the whole science\r\nof cookery, and thus arose the art of making puddings. The porridge of\r\nthe Scotch is nothing more than a species of hasty pudding, composed of\r\noatmeal, salt, and water; and the \"red pottage\" for which Esau sold his\r\nbirthright, must have been something similar. The barley-gruel of the\r\nLacedaemonians, of the Athenian gladiators and common people, was the\r\nsame, with the exception of the slight seasoning it had beyond the\r\nsimplicity of Scottish fare. Here is the ancient recipe for the Athenian\r\nnational dish:--\"Dry near the fire, in the oven, twenty pounds of\r\nbarley-flour; then parch it; add three pounds of linseed-meal, half a\r\npound of coriander-seed, two ounces of salt, and the quantity of water\r\nnecessary.\" To this sometimes a little millet was added, in order to\r\ngive the paste greater cohesion and delicacy.\r\n\r\n1177. OATMEAL AMONGST THE GREEKS AND ROMANS was highly esteemed, as was\r\nalso rice, which they considered as beneficial to the chest. They also\r\nheld in high repute the Irion, or Indian wheat of the moderns. The flour\r\nof this cereal was made into a kind of hasty pudding, and, parched or\r\nroasted, as eaten with a little salt. The Spelt, or Red wheat, was\r\nlikewise esteemed, and its flour formed the basis of the Carthaginian\r\npudding, for which we here give the scientific recipe:--\"Put a pound of\r\nred-wheat flour into water, and when it has steeped some time, transfer\r\nit to a wooden bowl. Add three pounds of cream cheese, half a pound of\r\nhoney, and one egg. Beat the whole together, and cook it on a slow fire\r\nin a stewpan.\" Should this be considered unpalatable, another form has\r\nbeen recommended. \"Sift the flour, and, with some water, put it into a\r\nwooden vessel, and, for ten days, renew the water twice each day. At the\r\nend of that period, press out the water and place the paste in another\r\nvessel. It is now to be reduced to the consistence of thick lees, and\r\npassed through a piece of new linen. Repeat this last operation, then\r\ndry the mass in the sun and boil it in milk. Season according to taste.\"\r\nThese are specimens of the puddings of antiquity, and this last recipe\r\nwas held in especial favour by the Romans.\r\n\r\n1178. HOWEVER GREAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE QUALIFICATIONS of the ancients,\r\nhowever, in the art of pudding-making, we apprehend that such\r\npreparations as gave gratification to their palates, would have\r\ngenerally found little favour amongst the insulated inhabitants of Great\r\nBritain. Here, from the simple suet dumpling up to the most complicated\r\nChristmas production, the grand feature of substantiality is primarily\r\nattended to. Variety in the ingredients, we think, is held only of\r\nsecondary consideration with the great body of the people, provided that\r\nthe whole is agreeable and of sufficient abundance.\r\n\r\n1179. ALTHOUGH FROM PUDDINGS TO PASTRY is but a step, it requires a\r\nhigher degree of art to make the one than to make the other. Indeed,\r\npastry is one of the most important branches of the culinary science. It\r\nunceasingly occupies itself with ministering pleasure to the sight as\r\nwell as to the taste; with erecting graceful monuments, miniature\r\nfortresses, and all kinds of architectural imitations, composed of the\r\nsweetest and most agreeable products of all climates and countries. At a\r\nvery early period, the Orientals were acquainted with the art of\r\nmanipulating in pastry; but they by no means attained to the taste,\r\nvariety, and splendour of design, by which it is characterized amongst\r\nthe moderns. At first it generally consisted of certain mixtures of\r\nflour, oil, and honey, to which it was confined for centuries, even\r\namong the southern nations of the European continent. At the\r\ncommencement of the middle ages, a change began to take place in the art\r\nof mixing it. Eggs, butter, and salt came into repute in the making of\r\npaste, which was forthwith used as an inclosure for meat, seasoned with\r\nspices. This advance attained, the next step was to inclose cream,\r\nfruit, and marmalades; and the next, to build pyramids and castles; when\r\nthe summit of the art of the pastry-cook may be supposed to have been\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MAKING OF PUDDINGS AND PASTRY.\r\n\r\n1180. A few general remarks respecting the various ingredients of which\r\npuddings and pastry are composed, may be acceptable as preliminary to\r\nthe recipes in this department of Household Management.\r\n\r\n1181. _Flour_ should be of the best quality, and perfectly dry, and\r\nsifted before being used; if in the least damp, the paste made from it\r\nwill certainly be heavy.\r\n\r\n1182. _Butter_, unless fresh is used, should be washed from the salt,\r\nand well squeezed and wrung in a cloth, to get out all the water and\r\nbuttermilk, which, if left in, assists to make the paste heavy.\r\n\r\n1183. _Lard_ should be perfectly sweet, which may be ascertained by\r\ncutting the bladder through, and, if the knife smells sweet, the lard is\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n1184. _Suet_ should be finely chopped, perfectly free from skin, and\r\nquite sweet; during the process of chopping, it should be lightly\r\ndredged with flour, which prevents the pieces from sticking together.\r\nBeef suet is considered the best; but veal suet, or the outside fat of a\r\nloin or neck of mutton, makes good crusts; as also the skimmings in\r\nwhich a joint of mutton has been boiled, but _without_ vegetables.\r\n\r\n1185. _Clarified Beef Dripping_, directions for which will be found in\r\nrecipes Nos. 621 and 622, answers very well for kitchen pies, puddings,\r\ncakes, or for family use. A very good short crust may be made by mixing\r\nwith it a small quantity of moist sugar; but care must be taken to use\r\nthe dripping sparingly, or a very disagreeable flavour will be imparted\r\nto the paste.\r\n\r\n1186. Strict cleanliness must be observed in pastry-making; all the\r\nutensils used should be perfectly free from dust and dirt, and the\r\nthings required for pastry, kept entirely for that purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PASTE-BOARD AND ROLLING-PIN.]\r\n\r\n1187. In mixing paste, add the water very gradually, work the whole\r\ntogether with the knife-blade, and knead it until perfectly smooth.\r\nThose who are inexperienced in pastry-making, should work the butter in\r\nby breaking it in small pieces and covering the paste rolled out. It\r\nshould then be dredged with flour, and the ends folded over and rolled\r\nout very thin again: this process must be repeated until all the butter\r\nis used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PASTE-PINCERS AND JAGGER, FOR ORNAMENTING THE EDGES OF\r\nPIE-CRUSTS.]\r\n\r\n1188. The art of making paste requires much practice, dexterity, and\r\nskill: it should be touched as lightly as possible, made with cool hands\r\nand in a cool place (a marble slab is better than a board for the\r\npurpose), and the coolest part of the house should be selected for the\r\nprocess during warm weather.\r\n\r\n1189. To insure rich paste being light, great expedition must be used in\r\nthe making and baking; for if it stand long before it is put in the\r\noven, it becomes flat and heavy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PASTE-CUTTER AND CORNER-CUTTER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORNAMENTAL-PASTE CUTTER.]\r\n\r\n1190. _Puff-paste_ requires a brisk oven, but not too hot, or it would\r\nblacken the crust; on the other hand, if the oven be too slack, the\r\npaste will be soddened, and will not rise, nor will it have any colour.\r\nTart-tins, cake-moulds, dishes for baked puddings, pattypans, &c.,\r\nshould all be buttered before the article intended to be baked is put in\r\nthem: things to be baked on sheets should be placed on buttered paper.\r\nRaised-pie paste should have a soaking heat, and paste glazed must have\r\nrather a slack oven, that the icing be not scorched. It is better to ice\r\ntarts, &c. when they are three-parts baked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PATTY-PANS, PLAIN AND FLUTED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIE-DISH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAISED-PIE MOULD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAISED-PIE MOULD, OPEN.]\r\n\r\n1191. To ascertain when the oven is heated to the proper degree for\r\npuff-paste, put a small piece of the paste in previous to baking the\r\nwhole, and then the heat can thus be judged of.\r\n\r\n1192. The freshness of all pudding ingredients is of much importance, as\r\none bad article will taint the whole mixture.\r\n\r\n1193. When the _freshness_ of eggs is _doubtful_, break each one\r\nseparately in a cup, before mixing them altogether. Should there be a\r\nbad one amongst them, it can be thrown away; whereas, if mixed with the\r\ngood ones, the entire quantity would be spoiled. The yolks and whites\r\nbeaten separately make the articles they are put into much lighter.\r\n\r\n1194. Raisins and dried fruits for puddings should be carefully picked,\r\nand, in many cases, stoned. Currants should be well washed, pressed in a\r\ncloth, and placed on a dish before the fire to get thoroughly dry; they\r\nshould then be picked carefully over, and _every piece of grit or stone_\r\nremoved from amongst them. To plump them, some cooks pour boiling water\r\nover them, and then dry them before the fire.\r\n\r\n1195. Batter pudding should be smoothly mixed and free from lumps. To\r\ninsure this, first mix the flour with a very small proportion of milk,\r\nand add the remainder by degrees. Should the pudding be very lumpy, it\r\nmay be strained through a hair sieve.\r\n\r\n1196. _All boiled puddings_ should be put on in _boiling water_, which\r\nmust not be allowed to stop simmering, and the pudding must always be\r\ncovered with the water; if requisite, the saucepan should be kept filled\r\nup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILED-PUDDING MOULD.]\r\n\r\n1197. To prevent a pudding boiled in a cloth from sticking to the bottom\r\nof the saucepan, place a small plate or saucer underneath it, and set\r\nthe pan _on a trivet_ over the fire. If a mould is used, this precaution\r\nis not necessary; but care must be taken to keep the pudding well\r\ncovered with water.\r\n\r\n1198. For dishing a boiled pudding as soon as it comes out of the pot,\r\ndip it into a basin of cold water, and the cloth will then not adhere to\r\nit. Great expedition is necessary in sending puddings to table, as, by\r\nstanding, they quickly become heavy, batter puddings particularly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILED-PUDDING MOULD.]\r\n\r\n1199. For baked or boiled puddings, the moulds, cups, or basins, should\r\nbe always buttered before the mixture is put in them, and they should be\r\nput into the saucepan directly they are filled.\r\n\r\n1200. Scrupulous attention should be paid to the cleanliness of\r\npudding-cloths, as, from neglect in this particular, the outsides of\r\nboiled puddings frequently taste very disagreeably. As soon as possible\r\nafter it is taken off the pudding, it should be soaked in water, and\r\nthen well washed, without soap, unless it be very greasy. It should be\r\ndried out of doors, then folded up and kept in a dry place. When wanted\r\nfor use, dip it in boiling water, and dredge it slightly with flour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUDDING-BASIN.]\r\n\r\n1201. The _dry ingredients_ for puddings are better for being mixed some\r\ntime before they are wanted; the liquid portion should only be added\r\njust before the pudding is put into the saucepan.\r\n\r\n1202. A pinch of salt is an improvement to the generality of puddings;\r\nbut this ingredient should be added very sparingly, as the flavour\r\nshould not be detected.\r\n\r\n1203. When baked puddings are sufficiently solid, turn them out of the\r\ndish they were baked in, bottom uppermost, and strew over them fine\r\nsifted sugar.\r\n\r\n1204. When pastry or baked puddings are not done through, and yet the\r\noutside is sufficiently brown, cover them over with a piece of white\r\npaper until thoroughly cooked: this prevents them from getting burnt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERY GOOD PUFF-PASTE.\r\n\r\n1205. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 1 lb. of butter, and not\r\nquite 1/2 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Carefully weigh the flour and butter, and have the exact\r\nproportion; squeeze the butter well, to extract the water from it, and\r\nafterwards wring it in a clean cloth, that no moisture may remain. Sift\r\nthe flour; see that it is perfectly dry, and proceed in the following\r\nmanner to make the paste, using a very _clean_ paste-board and\r\nrolling-pin:--Supposing the quantity to be 1 lb. of flour, work the\r\nwhole into a smooth paste, with not quite 1/2 pint of water, using a\r\nknife to mix it with: the proportion of this latter ingredient must be\r\nregulated by the discretion of the cook; if too much be added, the\r\npaste, when baked, will be tough. Roll it out until it is of an equal\r\nthickness of about an inch; break 4 oz. of the butter into small pieces;\r\nplace these on the paste, sift over it a little flour, fold it over,\r\nroll out again, and put another 4 oz. of butter. Repeat the rolling and\r\nbuttering until the paste has been rolled out 4 times, or equal\r\nquantities of flour and butter have been used. Do not omit, every time\r\nthe paste is rolled out, to dredge a little flour over that and the\r\nrolling-pin, to prevent both from sticking. Handle the paste as lightly\r\nas possible, and do not press heavily upon it with the rolling-pin. The\r\nnext thing to be considered is the oven, as the baking of pastry\r\nrequires particular attention. Do not put it into the oven until it is\r\nsufficiently hot to raise the paste; for the best-prepared paste, if not\r\nproperly baked, will be good for nothing. Brushing the paste as often as\r\nrolled out, and the pieces of butter placed thereon, with the white of\r\nan egg, assists it to rise in _leaves_ or _flakes_. As this is the great\r\nbeauty of puff-paste, it is as well to try this method.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 4d. per lb.\r\n\r\n    BUTTER.--About the second century of the Christian era, butter\r\n    was placed by Galen amongst the useful medical agents; and about\r\n    a century before him, Dioscorides mentioned that he had noticed\r\n    that fresh butter, made of ewes' and goats' milk, was served at\r\n    meals instead of oil, and that it took the place of fat in\r\n    making pastry. Thus we have undoubted authority that, eighteen\r\n    hundred years ago, there existed a knowledge of the useful\r\n    qualities of butter. The Romans seem to have set about making it\r\n    much as we do; for Pliny tells us, \"Butter is made from milk;\r\n    and the use of this element, so much sought after by barbarous\r\n    nations, distinguished the rich from the common people. It is\r\n    obtained principally from cows' milk; that from ewes is the\r\n    fattest; goats also supply some. It is produced by agitating the\r\n    milk in long vessels with narrow openings: a little water is\r\n    added.\"\r\n\r\nMEDIUM PUFF-PASTE.\r\n\r\n1206. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 8 oz. of butter, 4 oz.\r\nof lard, not quite 1/2 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--This paste may be made by the directions in the preceding\r\nrecipe, only using less butter and substituting lard for a portion of\r\nit. Mix the flour to a smooth paste with not quite 1/2 pint of water;\r\nthen roll it out 3 times, the first time covering the paste with butter,\r\nthe second with lard, and the third with butter. Keep the rolling-pin\r\nand paste slightly dredged with flour, to prevent them from sticking,\r\nand it will be ready for use.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n    BUTTER IN HASTE.--In his \"History of Food,\" Soyer says that to\r\n    obtain butter instantly, it is only necessary, in summer, to put\r\n    new milk into a bottle, some hours after it has been taken from\r\n    the cow, and shake it briskly. The clots which are thus formed\r\n    should be thrown into a sieve, washed and pressed together, and\r\n    they constitute the finest and most delicate butter that can\r\n    possibly be made.\r\n\r\nCOMMON PASTE, for Family Pies.\r\n\r\n1207. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/4 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of butter, rather more\r\nthan 1/2 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the butter lightly into the flour, and mix it to a smooth\r\npaste with the water; roll it out 2 or 3 times, and it will be ready for\r\nuse. This paste may be converted into an excellent short crust for sweet\r\ntart, by adding to the flour, after the butter is rubbed in, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of fine-sifted sugar.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d. per lb.\r\n\r\n    TO KEEP BUTTER FRESH.--One of the best means to preserve butter\r\n    fresh is, first to completely press out all the buttermilk, then\r\n    to keep it under water, renewing the water frequently, and to\r\n    remove it from the influence of heat and air, by wrapping it in\r\n    a wet cloth.\r\n\r\nFRENCH PUFF-PASTE, or FEUILLETAGE.\r\n\r\n(Founded on M. Ude's Recipe.)\r\n\r\n1208. INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of flour and butter--say 1 lb. of\r\neach; 1/2 saltspoonful of salt, the yolks of 2 eggs, rather more than\r\n1/4 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Weigh the flour; ascertain that it is perfectly _dry_, and sift\r\nit; squeeze all the water from the butter, and wring it in a clean cloth\r\ntill there is no moisture remaining. Put the flour on the paste-board,\r\nwork lightly into it 2 oz. of the butter, and then make a hole in the\r\ncentre; into this well put the yolks of 2 eggs, the salt, and about 1/4\r\npint of water (the quantity of this latter ingredient must be regulated\r\nby the cook, as it is impossible to give the exact proportion of it);\r\nknead up the paste quickly and lightly, and, when quite smooth, roll it\r\nout square to the thickness of about 1/2 inch. Presuming that the butter\r\nis perfectly free from moisture, and _as cool_ as possible, roll it into\r\na ball, and place this ball of butter on the paste; fold the paste over\r\nthe butter all round, and secure it by wrapping it well all over.\r\nFlatten the paste by rolling it lightly with the rolling-pin until it is\r\nquite thin, but not thin enough to allow the butter to break through,\r\nand keep the board and paste dredged lightly with flour during the\r\nprocess of making it. This rolling gives it the _first_ turn. Now fold\r\nthe paste in three, and roll out again, and, should the weather be very\r\nwarm, put it in a cold place on the ground to cool between the several\r\nturns; for, unless this is particularly attended to, the paste will be\r\nspoiled. Roll out the paste again _twice_, put it by to cool, then roll\r\nit out _twice_ more, which will make 6 _turnings_ in all. Now fold the\r\npaste in two, and it will be ready for use. If properly baked and well\r\nmade, this crust will be delicious, and should rise in the oven about 5\r\nor 6 inches. The paste should be made rather firm in the first instance,\r\nas the ball of butter is liable to break through. Great attention must\r\nalso be paid to keeping the butter very cool, as, if this is in a liquid\r\nand soft state, the paste will not answer at all. Should the cook be\r\ndexterous enough to succeed in making this, the paste will have a much\r\nbetter appearance than that made by the process of dividing the butter\r\ninto 4 parts, and placing it over the rolled-out paste; but, until\r\nexperience has been acquired, we recommend puff-paste made by recipe No.\r\n1205. The above paste is used for vols-au-vent, small articles of\r\npastry, and, in fact, everything that requires very light crust.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n    WHAT TO DO WITH RANCID BUTTER.--When butter has become very\r\n    rancid, it should be melted several times by a moderate heat,\r\n    with or without the addition of water, and as soon as it has\r\n    been well kneaded, after the cooling, in order to extract any\r\n    water it may have retained, it should be put into brown\r\n    freestone pots, sheltered from the contact of the air. The\r\n    French often add to it, after it has been melted, a piece of\r\n    toasted bread, which helps to destroy the tendency of the batter\r\n    to rancidity.\r\n\r\nSOYER'S RECIPE FOR PUFF-PASTE.\r\n\r\n1209. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow the yolk of 1 egg, the\r\njuice of 1 lemon, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt, cold water, 1 lb. of fresh\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the flour on to the paste-board; make a hole in the centre,\r\ninto which put the yolk of the egg, the lemon-juice, and salt; mix the\r\nwhole with cold water (this should be iced in summer, if convenient)\r\ninto a soft flexible paste, with the right hand, and handle it as little\r\nas possible; then squeeze all the buttermilk from the butter, wring it\r\nin a cloth, and roll out the paste; place the butter on this, and fold\r\nthe edges of the paste over, so as to hide it; roll it out again to the\r\nthickness of 1/4 inch; fold over one third, over which again pass the\r\nrolling-pin; then fold over the other third, thus forming a square;\r\nplace it with the ends, top, and bottom before you, shaking a little\r\nflour both under and over, and repeat the rolls and turns twice again,\r\nas before. Flour a baking-sheet, put the paste on this, and let it\r\nremain on ice or in some cool place for 1/2 hour; then roll twice more,\r\nturning it as before; place it again upon the ice for 1/4 hour, give it\r\n2 more rolls, making 7 in all, and it is ready for use when required.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERY GOOD SHORT CRUST FOR FRUIT TARTS.\r\n\r\n1210. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 3/4 lb. of butter, 1\r\ntablespoonful of sifted sugar, 1/3 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the butter into the flour, after having ascertained that\r\nthe latter is perfectly dry; add the sugar, and mix the whole into a\r\nstiff paste, with about 1/3 pint of water. Roll it out two or three\r\ntimes, folding the paste over each time, and it will be ready for use.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 1d. per lb.\r\n\r\nANOTHER GOOD SHORT CRUST.\r\n\r\n1211. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 8 oz. of butter, the\r\nyolks of 2 eggs, 2 oz. of sifted sugar, about 1/4 pint of milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the butter into the flour, add the sugar, and mix the whole\r\nas lightly as possible to a smooth paste, with the yolks of eggs well\r\nbeaten, and the milk. The proportion of the latter ingredient must be\r\njudged of by the size of the eggs: if these are large, so much will not\r\nbe required, and more if the eggs are smaller.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n    SUGAR AND BEETROOT.--There are two sorts of Beet,--white and\r\n    red; occasionally, in the south, a yellow variety is met with.\r\n    Beetroot contains twenty parts sugar. Everybody knows that the\r\n    beet has competed with the sugar-cane, and a great part of the\r\n    French sugar is manufactured from beet. Beetroot has a\r\n    refreshing, composing, and slightly purgative quality. The young\r\n    leaves, when cooked, are a substitute for spinach; they are also\r\n    useful for mixing with sorrel, to lessen its acidity. The large\r\n    ribs of the leaves are serviceable in various culinary\r\n    preparations; the root also may be prepared in several ways, but\r\n    its most general use is in salad. Some writers upon the subject\r\n    have expressed their opinion that beetroot is easily digested,\r\n    but those who have taken pains to carefully analyze its\r\n    qualities make quite a contrary statement. Youth, of course, can\r\n    digest it; but to persons of a certain age beet is very\r\n    indigestible, or rather, it does not digest at all. It is not\r\n    the sugary pulp which is indigestible, but its fibrous network\r\n    that resists the action of the gastric organs. Thus, when the\r\n    root is reduced to a puree, almost any person may eat it.\r\n\r\n    FRENCH SUGAR.--It had long been thought that tropical heat was\r\n    not necessary to form sugar, and, about 1740, it was discovered\r\n    that many plants of the temperate zone, and amongst others the\r\n    beet, contained it. Towards the beginning of the 19th century,\r\n    circumstances having, in France, made sugar scarce, and\r\n    consequently dear, the government caused inquiries to be\r\n    instituted as to the possibility of finding a substitute for it.\r\n    Accordingly, it was ascertained that sugar exists in the whole\r\n    vegetable kingdom; that it is to be found in the grape,\r\n    chestnut, potato; but that, far above all, the beet contains it\r\n    in a large proportion. Thus the beet became an object of the\r\n    most careful culture; and many experiments went to prove that in\r\n    this respect the old world was independent of the new. Many\r\n    manufactories came into existence in all parts of France, and\r\n    the making of sugar became naturalized in that country.\r\n\r\nCOMMON SHORT CRUST.\r\n\r\n1212. INGREDIENTS.--To every pound of flour allow 2 oz. of sifted sugar,\r\n3 oz. of butter, about 1/2 pint of boiling milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Crumble the butter into the flour as finely as possible, add\r\nthe sugar, and work the whole up to a smooth paste with the boiling\r\nmilk. Roll it out thin, and bake in a moderate oven.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n    QUALITIES OF SUGAR.--Sugars obtained from various plants are in\r\n    fact, of the same nature, and have no intrinsic difference when\r\n    they have become equally purified by the same processes. Taste,\r\n    crystallization, colour, weight, are absolutely identical; and\r\n    the most accurate observer cannot distinguish the one from the\r\n    other.\r\n\r\nBUTTER CRUST, for Boiled Puddings.\r\n\r\n1213. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 6 oz. of butter, 1/2\r\npint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--With a knife, work the flour to a smooth paste with 1/2 pint of\r\nwater; roll the crust out rather thin; place the butter over it in small\r\npieces; dredge lightly over it some flour, and fold the paste over;\r\nrepeat the rolling once more, and the crust will be ready for use. It\r\nmay be enriched by adding another 2 oz. of butter; but, for ordinary\r\npurposes, the above quantity will be found quite sufficient.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIPPING CRUST, for Kitchen Puddings, Pies, &c.\r\n\r\n1214. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 6 oz. of clarified beef\r\ndripping, 1/2 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--After having clarified the dripping, by either of the recipes\r\nNo. 621 or 622, weigh it, and to every lb. of flour allow the above\r\nproportion of dripping. With a knife, work the flour into a smooth paste\r\nwith the water, rolling it out 3 times, each time placing on the crust 2\r\noz. of the dripping, broken into small pieces. If this paste is lightly\r\nmade, if good dripping is used, and _not too much_ of it, it will be\r\nfound good; and by the addition of two tablespoonfuls of fine moist\r\nsugar, it may be converted into a common short crust for fruit pies.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d. per pound.\r\n\r\n    WATER:--WHAT THE ANCIENTS THOUGHT OF IT.--All the nations of\r\n    antiquity possessed great veneration for water: thus, the\r\n    Egyptians offered prayers and homage to water, and the Nile was\r\n    an especial object of their adoration; the Persians would not\r\n    wash their hands; the Scythians honoured the Danube; the Greeks\r\n    and Romans erected altars to the fountains and rivers; and some\r\n    of the architectural embellishments executed for fountains in\r\n    Greece were remarkable for their beauty and delicacy. The purity\r\n    of the water was a great object of the care of the ancients; and\r\n    we learn that the Athenians appointed four officers to keep\r\n    watch and ward over the water in their city. These men had to\r\n    keep the fountains in order and clean the reservoirs, so that\r\n    the water might be preserved pure and limpid. Like officers were\r\n    appointed in other Greek cities.\r\n\r\nSUET CRUST, for Pies or Puddings.\r\n\r\n1215. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 5 or 6 oz. of beef suet,\r\n1/2 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Free the suet from skin and shreds; chop it extremely fine, and\r\nrub it well into the flour; work the whole to a smooth paste with the\r\nabove proportion of water; roll it out, and it is ready for use. This\r\ncrust is quite rich enough for ordinary purposes, but when a better one\r\nis desired, use from 1/2 to 3/4 lb. of suet to every lb. of flour. Some\r\ncooks, for rich crusts, pound the suet in a mortar, with a small\r\nquantity of butter. It should then be laid on the paste in small pieces,\r\nthe same as for puff-crust, and will be found exceedingly nice for hot\r\ntarts. 5 oz. of suet to every lb. of flour will make a very good crust;\r\nand even 1/4 lb. will answer very well for children, or where the crust\r\nis wanted very plain.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 5d. per lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATE BRISEE, or FRENCH CRUST, for Raised Pies.\r\n\r\n1216. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 1/2 saltspoonful of\r\nsalt, 2 eggs, 1/3 pint of water, 6 oz. of butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Spread the flour, which should be sifted and thoroughly dry, on\r\nthe paste-board; make a hole in the centre, into which put the butter;\r\nwork it lightly into the flour, and when quite fine, add the salt; work\r\nthe whole into a smooth paste with the eggs (yolks and whites) and\r\nwater, and make it very firm. Knead the paste well, and let it be rather\r\nstiff, that the sides of the pie may be easily raised, and that they do\r\nnot afterwards tumble or shrink.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This paste may be very much enriched by making it with equal\r\nquantities of flour and butter; but then it is not so easily raised as\r\nwhen made plainer.\r\n\r\n    WATER SUPPLY IN ROME.--Nothing in Italy is more extraordinary\r\n    than the remains of the ancient aqueducts. At first, the Romans\r\n    were contented with the water from the Tiber. Ancus Martius was\r\n    the first to commence the building of aqueducts destined to\r\n    convey the water of the fountain of Piconia from Tibur to Rome,\r\n    a distance of some 33,000 paces. Appius Claudius continued the\r\n    good work, and to him is due the completion of the celebrated\r\n    Appian Way. In time, the gigantic waterways greatly multiplied,\r\n    and, by the reign of Nero, there were constructed nine principal\r\n    aqueducts, the pipes of which were of bricks, baked tiles,\r\n    stone, lead, or wood. According to the calculation of Vigenerus,\r\n    half a million hogsheads of water were conveyed into Rome every\r\n    day, by upwards of 10,000 small pipes not one-third of an inch\r\n    in diameter. The water was received in large closed basins,\r\n    above which rose splendid monuments: these basins supplied other\r\n    subterranean conduits, connected with various quarters of the\r\n    city, and these conveyed water to small reservoirs furnished\r\n    with taps for the exclusive use of certain streets. The water\r\n    which was not drinkable ran out, by means of large pipes, into\r\n    extensive inclosures, where it served to water cattle. At these\r\n    places the people wished their linen; and here, too, was a\r\n    supply of the necessary element in case of fire.\r\n\r\nCOMMON CRUST FOR RAISED PIES.\r\n\r\n1217. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 1/2 pint of water, 1-1/2\r\noz. of butter, 1-1/2 oz. of lard, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put into a saucepan the water; when it boils, add the butter\r\nand lard; and when these are melted, make a hole in the middle of the\r\nflour; pour in the water gradually; beat it well with a wooden spoon,\r\nand be particular in not making the paste too soft. When it is well\r\nmixed, knead it with the hands until quite stiff, dredging a little\r\nflour over the paste and board, to prevent them from sticking. When it\r\nis well kneaded, place it before the fire, with a cloth covered over it,\r\nfor a few minutes; it will then be more easily worked into shape. This\r\npaste does not taste so nicely as the preceding one, but is worked with\r\ngreater facility, and answers just as well for raised pies, for the\r\ncrust is seldom eaten.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 5d, per lb.\r\n\r\nLARD OR FLEAD CRUST.\r\n\r\n1218. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 1/2 lb. of lard or\r\nflead, 1/2 pint of water, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Clear the flead free from skin, and slice it into thin flakes;\r\nrub it into the flour, add the salt, and work the whole into a smooth\r\npaste, with the above proportion of water; fold the paste over two or\r\nthree times, beat it well with the rolling-pin, roll it out, and it will\r\nbe ready for use. The crust made from this will be found extremely\r\nlight, and may be made into cakes or tarts; it may also be very much\r\nenriched by adding more flead to the same proportion of flour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d. per lb.\r\n\r\n    NUTRITIOUS QUALITIES OF FLOUR.--The gluten of grain and the\r\n    albumen of vegetable juices are identical in composition with\r\n    the albumen of blood. Vegetable caseine has also the composition\r\n    of animal caseine. The finest wheat flour contains more starch\r\n    than the coarser; the bran of wheat is proportionably richer in\r\n    gluten. Rye and rye-bread contain a substance resembling\r\n    starch-gum (or dextrine, as it is called) in its properties,\r\n    which is very easily converted into sugar. The starch of barley\r\n    approaches in many properties to cellulose, and is, therefore,\r\n    less digestible. Oats are particularly rich in plastic\r\n    substances; Scotch oats are richer than those grown in England\r\n    or in Germany. This kind of grain contains in its ashes, after\r\n    deduction of the silica of the husks, very nearly the same\r\n    ingredients as are found in the ashes of the juice of flesh.\r\n    Fine American flour is one of the varieties which is richest in\r\n    gluten, and is consequently one of the most nutritious.\r\n\r\nALMOND CHEESECAKES.\r\n\r\n1219. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of sweet almonds, 4 bitter ones, 3 eggs, 2\r\noz. of butter, the rind of 1/4 lemon, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 3\r\noz. of sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Blanch and pound the almonds smoothly in a mortar, with a\r\nlittle rose- or spring-water; stir in the eggs, which should be well\r\nbeaten, and the butter, which should be warmed; add the grated\r\nlemon-peel and -juice, sweeten, and stir well until the whole is\r\nthoroughly mixed. Line some pattypans with puff-paste, put in the\r\nmixture, and bake for 20 minutes, or rather less in a quick oven.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes, or rather less.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for about 12 cheesecakes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALMOND AND BLOSSOM.]\r\n\r\n    ALMONDS.--Almonds are the fruit of the _Amygdalus commenis_, and\r\n    are cultivated throughout the whole of the south of Europe,\r\n    Syria, Persia, and Northern Africa; but England is mostly\r\n    supplied with those which are grown in Spain and the south of\r\n    France. They are distinguished into Sweet and Bitter, the\r\n    produce of different varieties. Of the sweet, there are two\r\n    varieties, distinguished in commerce by the names of Jordan and\r\n    Valentia almonds. The former are imported from Malaga, and are\r\n    longer, narrower, more pointed, and more highly esteemed than\r\n    the latter, which are imported from Valentia. Bitter almonds are\r\n    principally obtained from Morocco, and are exported from\r\n    Mogador.\r\n\r\nALMOND PASTE, for Second-Course Dishes.\r\n\r\n1220. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of sweet almonds, 6 bitter ones, 1 lb. of very\r\nfinely sifted sugar, the whites of 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Blanch the almonds, and dry them thoroughly; put them into a\r\nmortar, and pound them well, wetting them gradually with the whites of 2\r\neggs. When well pounded, put them into a small preserving-pan, add the\r\nsugar, and place the pan on a small but clear fire (a hot-plate is\r\nbetter); keep stirring until the paste is dry, then take it out of the\r\npan, put it between two dishes, and, when cold, make it into any shape\r\nthat fancy may dictate.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 2s. for the above quantity.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 small dishes of pastry.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    BITTER ALMONDS.--The Bitter Almond is a variety of the common\r\n    almond, and is injurious to animal life, on account of the great\r\n    quantity of hydrocyanic acid it contains, and is consequently\r\n    seldom used in domestic economy, unless it be to give flavour to\r\n    confectionery; and even then it should he used with great\r\n    caution. A single drop of the essential oil of bitter almonds is\r\n    sufficient to destroy a bird, and four drops have caused the\r\n    death of a middle-sized dog.\r\n\r\nBAKED ALMOND PUDDING.\r\n\r\n(_Very rich_.)\r\n\r\n1221. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of almonds, 4 bitter ditto, 1 glass of\r\nsherry, 4 eggs, the rind and juice of 1/2 lemon, 3 oz. of butter, 1 pint\r\nof cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Blanch and pound the almonds to a smooth paste with the water;\r\nmix these with the butter, which should be melted; beat up the eggs,\r\ngrate the lemon-rind, and strain the juice; add these, with the cream,\r\nsugar, and wine, to the other ingredients, and stir them well together.\r\nWhen well mixed, put it into a pie-dish lined with puff-paste, and bake\r\nfor 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 2s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--To make this pudding more economically, substitute milk for the\r\ncream; but then add rather more than 1 oz. of finely grated bread.\r\n\r\n    USES OF THE SWEET ALMOND.--The kernels of the sweet almond are\r\n    used either in a green or ripe state, and as an article in the\r\n    dessert. Into cookery, confectionery, perfumery, and medicine,\r\n    they largely enter, and in domestic economy, should always be\r\n    used in preference to bitter almonds. The reason for advising\r\n    this, is because the kernels do not contain any hydrocyanic or\r\n    prussic acid, although it is found in the leaves, flowers, and\r\n    bark of the tree. When young and green, they are preserved in\r\n    sugar, like green apricots. They furnish the almond-oil; and the\r\n    farinaceous matter which is left after the oil is expressed,\r\n    forms the _pâte d'amandes_ of perfumers. In the arts, the oil is\r\n    employed for the same purposes as the olive-oil, and forms the\r\n    basis of kalydor, macassar oil, Gowland's lotion, and many other\r\n    articles of that kind vended by perfumers. In medicine, it is\r\n    considered a nutritive, laxative, and an emollient.\r\n\r\nSMALL ALMOND PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n1222. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of sweet almonds, 6 bitter ones, 1/4 lb. of\r\nbutter, 4 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of sifted sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\ncream, 1 tablespoonful of brandy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALMOND PUDDINGS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Blanch and pound the almonds to a smooth paste with a spoonful\r\nof water; warm the butter, mix the almonds with this, and add the other\r\ningredients, leaving out the whites of 2 eggs, and be particular that\r\nthese are well beaten. Mix well, butter some cups, half fill them, and\r\nbake the puddings from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour. Turn them out on a dish,\r\nand serve with sweet sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    THE HUSKS OF ALMONDS.--In the environs of Alicante, the husks of\r\n    almonds are ground to a powder, and enter into the composition\r\n    of common soap, the large quantity of alkaline principle they\r\n    contain rendering them suitable for this purpose. It is said\r\n    that in some parts of the south of France, where they are\r\n    extensively grown, horses and mules are fed on the green and dry\r\n    husks; but, to prevent any evil consequences arising from this\r\n    practice, they are mixed with chopped straw or oats.\r\n\r\nALMOND PUFFS.\r\n\r\n1223. INGREDIENTS.--2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 2 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of\r\npounded sugar, 2 oz. of sweet almonds, 4 bitter almonds.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Blanch and pound the almonds in a mortar to a smooth paste;\r\nmelt the butter, dredge in the flour, and add the sugar and pounded\r\nalmonds. Beat the mixture well, and put it into cups or very tiny\r\njelly-pots, which should be well buttered, and bake in a moderate oven\r\nfor about 20 minutes, or longer should the puffs be large. Turn them out\r\non a dish, the bottom of the puff upper-most, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes. _Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 or 3 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUNT NELLY'S PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1224. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of treacle, 1/2 lb. of\r\nsuet, the rind and juice of 1 lemon, a few strips of candied lemon-peel,\r\n3 tablespoonfuls of cream, 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the suet finely; mix with it the flour, treacle,\r\nlemon-peel minced, and candied lemon-peel; add the cream, lemon-juice,\r\nand 2 well-beaten eggs; beat the pudding well, put it into a buttered\r\nbasin, tie it down with a cloth, and boil from 3-1/2 to 4 hours.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3-1/2 to 4 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time, but more suitable for a winter pudding.\r\n\r\n    TREACLE, OR MOLASSES.--Treacle is the uncrystallizable part of\r\n    the saccharine juice drained from the Muscovado sugar, and is\r\n    either naturally so or rendered uncrystallizable through some\r\n    defect in the process of boiling. As it contains a large\r\n    quantity of sweet or saccharine principle and is cheap, it is of\r\n    great use as an article of domestic economy. Children are\r\n    especially fond of it; and it is accounted wholesome. It is also\r\n    useful for making beer, rum, and the very dark syrups.\r\n\r\nBAKED APPLE DUMPLINGS (a Plain Family Dish).\r\n\r\n1225. INGREDIENTS.--6 apples, 3/4 lb.. of suet-crust No. 1215, sugar to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare and take out the cores of the apples without dividing\r\nthem, and make 1/2 lb. of suet-crust by recipe No. 1215; roll the apples\r\nin the crust, previously sweetening them with moist sugar, and taking\r\ncare to join the paste nicely. When they are formed into round balls,\r\nput them on a tin, and bake them for about 1/2 hour, or longer should\r\nthe apples be very large; arrange them pyramidically on a dish, and sift\r\nover them some pounded white sugar. These may be made richer by using\r\none of the puff-pastes instead of suet.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 1/2 to 3/4 hour, or longer. _Average cost_, 1-1/2d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March, but flavourless after the end of\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\n    USES OF THE APPLE.--It is well known that this fruit forms a\r\n    very important article of food, in the form of pies and\r\n    puddings, and furnishes several delicacies, such as sauces,\r\n    marmalades, and jellies, and is much esteemed as a dessert\r\n    fruit. When flattened in the form of round cakes, and baked in\r\n    ovens, they are called beefings; and large quantities are\r\n    annually dried in the sun in America, as well as in Normandy,\r\n    and stored for use during winter, when they may be stewed or\r\n    made into pies. In a roasted state they are remarkably\r\n    wholesome, and, it is said, strengthening to a weak stomach. In\r\n    putrid and malignant fevers, when used with the juice of lemons\r\n    and currants, they are considered highly efficacious.\r\n\r\nAPPLE CHEESECAKES.\r\n\r\n1226. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of apple pulp, 1/4 lb. of sifted sugar, 1/4\r\nlb. of butter, 4 eggs, the rind and juice of 1 lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare, core, and boil sufficient apples to make 1/2 lb. when\r\ncooked; add to these the sugar, the butter, which should be melted; the\r\neggs, leaving out 2 of the whites, and take grated rind and juice of 1\r\nlemon; stir the mixture well; line some patty-pans with puff-paste, put\r\nin the mixture, and bake about 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for the above quantity, with the paste, 1s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for about 18 or 20 cheesecakes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPLE AND BLOSSOM.]\r\n\r\n    THE APPLE.--The most useful of all the British fruits is the\r\n    apple, which is a native of Britain, and may be found in woods\r\n    and hedges, in the form of the common wild crab, of which all\r\n    our best apples are merely seminal varieties, produced by\r\n    culture or particular circumstances. In most temperate climates\r\n    it is very extensively cultivated, and in England, both as\r\n    regards variety and quantity, it is excellent and abundant.\r\n    Immense supplies are also imported from the United States and\r\n    from France. The apples grown in the vicinity of New York are\r\n    universally admitted to be the finest of any; but unless\r\n    selected and packed with great care, they are apt to spoil\r\n    before reaching England.\r\n\r\nBOILED APPLE DUMPLINGS.\r\n\r\n1227. INGREDIENTS.--6 apples, 3/4 lb. of suet-crust No. 1215, sugar to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare and take out the cores of the apples without dividing\r\nthem; sweeten, and roll each apple in a piece of crust, made by recipe\r\nNo. 1211; be particular that the paste is nicely joined; put the\r\ndumplings into floured cloths, tie them securely, and put them into\r\nboiling water. Keep them boiling from 1/2 to 3/4 hour; remove the\r\ncloths, and send them hot and quickly to table. Dumplings boiled in\r\nknitted cloths have a very pretty appearance when they come to table.\r\nThe cloths should be made square, just large enough to hold one\r\ndumpling, and should be knitted in plain knitting, with _very coarse_\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 to 1 hour, or longer should the dumplings be very large.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 11/2d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March, but flavourless after the end of\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\n    LAMBSWOOL, or LAMASOOL.--This old English beverage is composed\r\n    of apples mixed with ale, and seasoned with sugar and spice. It\r\n    takes its name from _Lamaes abhal_, which, in ancient British,\r\n    signifies the day of apple fruit, from being drunk on the apple\r\n    feast in autumn. In France, a beverage, called by the Parisians\r\n    _raisinée_, is made by boiling any given quantity of new wine,\r\n    skimming it as often as fresh scum rises, and, when it is boiled\r\n    to half its bulk, straining it. To this apples, pared and cut\r\n    into quarters, are added; the whole is then allowed to simmer\r\n    gently, stirring it all the time with a long wooden spoon, till\r\n    the apples are thoroughly mixed with the liquor, and the whole\r\n    forms a species of marmalade, which is extremely agreeable to\r\n    the taste, having a slight flavour of acidity, like lemon mixed\r\n    with honey.\r\n\r\nRICH BAKED APPLE PUDDING.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n1228. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of the pulp of apples, 1/2 lb. of loaf\r\nsugar, 6 oz. of butter, the rind of 1 lemon, 6 eggs, puff-paste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel, core, and cut the apples, as for sauce; put them into a\r\nstewpan, with only just sufficient water to prevent them from burning,\r\nand let them stew until reduced to a pulp. Weigh the pulp, and to every\r\n1/2 lb. add sifted sugar, grated lemon-rind, and 6 well-beaten eggs.\r\nBeat these ingredients well together; then melt the butter, stir it to\r\nthe other things, put a border of puff-paste round the dish, and bake\r\nfor rather more than 1/2 hour. The butter should not be added until the\r\npudding is ready for the oven.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n(_More Economical_.)\r\n\r\n1229. INGREDIENTS.--12 large apples, 6 oz. of moist sugar, 1/4 lb. of\r\nbutter, 4 eggs, 1 pint of bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare, core, and cut the apples, as for sauce, and boil them\r\nuntil reduced to a pulp; then add the butter, melted, and the eggs,\r\nwhich should be well whisked. Beat up the pudding for 2 or 3 minutes;\r\nbutter a pie-dish; put in a layer of bread crumbs, then the apple, and\r\nthen another layer of bread crumbs; flake over these a few tiny pieces\r\nof butter, and bake for about 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A very good economical pudding may be made merely with apples,\r\nboiled and sweetened, with the addition of a few strips of lemon-peel. A\r\nlayer of bread crumbs should be placed above and below the apples, and\r\nthe pudding baked for 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n    CONSTITUENTS OF THE APPLE.--All apples contain sugar, malic\r\n    acid, or the acid of apples; mucilage, or gum; woody fibre, and\r\n    water; together with some aroma, on which their peculiar flavour\r\n    depends. The hard acid kinds are unwholesome if eaten raw; but\r\n    by the process of cooking, a great deal of this acid is\r\n    decomposed and converted into sugar. The sweet and mellow kinds\r\n    form a valuable addition to the dessert. A great part of the\r\n    acid juice is converted into sugar as the fruit ripens, and even\r\n    after it is gathered, by natural process, termed maturation;\r\n    but, when apples decay, the sugar is changed into a bitter\r\n    principle, and the mucilage becomes mouldy and offensive. Old\r\n    cheese has a remarkable effect in meliorating the apple when\r\n    eaten; probably from the volatile alkali or ammonia of the\r\n    cheese neutralizing its acid.\r\n\r\nRICH SWEET APPLE PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1230. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of bread crumbs, 1/2 lb. of suet, 1/2 lb. of\r\ncurrants, 1/2 lb. of apples, 1/2 lb. of moist sugar, 6 eggs, 12 sweet\r\nalmonds, 1/2 saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1 wineglassful of brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the suet very fine; wash the currants, dry them, and pick\r\naway the stalks and pieces of grit; pare, core, and chop the apple, and\r\ngrate the bread into fine crumbs, and mince the almonds. Mix all these\r\ningredients together, adding the sugar and nutmeg; beat up the eggs,\r\nomitting the whites of three; stir these to the pudding, and when all is\r\nwell mixed, add the brandy, and put the pudding into a buttered mould;\r\ntie down with a cloth, put it into boiling water, and let it boil for 3\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\n    TO PRESERVE APPLES.--The best mode of preserving apples is to\r\n    carry them at once to the fruit-room, where they should be put\r\n    upon shelves, covered with white paper, after gently wiping each\r\n    of the fruit. The room should be dry, and well aired, but should\r\n    not admit the sun. The finer and larger kinds of fruit should\r\n    not be allowed to touch each other, but should be kept separate.\r\n    For this purpose, a number of shallow trays should be provided,\r\n    supported by racks or stands above each other. In very cold\r\n    frosty weather, means should be adopted for warming the room.\r\n\r\nBAKED APPLE PUDDING.\r\n\r\n(_Very Good_.)\r\n\r\n1231. INGREDIENTS.--5 moderate-sized apples, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\nfinely-chopped suet, 3 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1 pint of milk,\r\na little grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the flour to a smooth batter with the milk; add the eggs,\r\nwhich should be well whisked, and put this batter into a well-buttered\r\npie-dish. Wipe the apples clean, but do not pare them; cut them in\r\nhalves, and take out the cores; lay them in the batter, rind uppermost;\r\nshake the suet on the top, over which, also grate a little nutmeg; bake\r\nin a moderate oven for an hour, and cover, when served, with sifted loaf\r\nsugar. This pudding is also very good with the apples pared, sliced, and\r\nmixed with the batter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED APPLE PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1232. INGREDIENTS.--Crust No. 1215, apples, sugar to taste, 1 small\r\nteaspoonful of finely-minced lemon-peel, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\nlemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a butter-crust by recipe No. 1213, or a suet one by recipe\r\nNo. 1215, using for a moderate-sized pudding from 3/4 to 1 lb. of flour,\r\nwith the other ingredients in proportion. Butter a basin; line it with\r\nsome of the paste; pare, core, and cut the apples into slices, and fill\r\nthe basin with these; add the sugar, the lemon-peel and juice, and cover\r\nwith crust; pinch the edges together, flour the cloth, place it over the\r\npudding, tie it securely, and put it into plenty of fast-boiling water.\r\nLet it boil from 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 hours, according to the size; then turn\r\nit out of the basin and send to table quickly. Apple puddings may also\r\nbe boiled in a cloth without a basin; but, when made in this way, must\r\nbe served without the least delay, as the crust so soon becomes heavy.\r\nApple pudding is a very convenient dish to have when the dinner-hour is\r\nrather uncertain, as it does not spoil by being boiled an extra hour;\r\ncare, however, must be taken to keep it well covered with the water all\r\nthe time, and not to allow it to stop boiling.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 hours, according to the size of the pudding\r\nand the quality of the apples.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, made with 1 lb. of flour, for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March; but the apples become flavourless and\r\nscarce after February.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE TART OR PIE.\r\n\r\n1233. INGREDIENTS.--Puff-paste No. 1205 or 1206, apples; to every lb. of\r\nunpared apples allow 2 oz. of moist sugar, 1/2 teaspoonful of\r\nfinely-minced lemon-peel, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make 1/2 lb. of puff-paste by either of the above-named\r\nrecipes, place a border of it round the edge of a pie-dish, and fill it\r\nwith apples pared, cored, and cut into slices; sweeten with moist sugar,\r\nadd the lemon-peel and juice, and 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of water; cover\r\nwith crust, cut it evenly round close to the edge of the pie-dish, and\r\nbake in a hot oven from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, or rather longer, should the\r\npie be very large. When it is three-parts done, take it out of the oven,\r\nput the white of an egg on a plate, and, with the blade of a knife,\r\nwhisk it to a froth; brush the pie over with this, then sprinkle upon it\r\nsome sifted sugar, and then a few drops of water. Put the pie back into\r\nthe oven, and finish baking, and be particularly careful that it does\r\nnot catch or burn, which it is very liable to do after the crust is\r\niced. If made with a plain crust, the icing may be omitted.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour before the crust is iced; 10 to 15 minutes afterwards.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 2 lbs. of apples for a tart for 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March; but the apples become flavourless\r\nafter February.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Many things are suggested for the flavouring of apple pie; some\r\nsay 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of beer, others the same quantity of sherry,\r\nwhich very much improve the taste; whilst the old-fashioned addition of\r\na few cloves is, by many persons, preferred to anything else, as also a\r\nfew slices of quince.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUINCE.]\r\n\r\n    QUINCES.--The environs of Corinth originally produced the most\r\n    beautiful quinces, but the plant was subsequently introduced\r\n    into Gaul with the most perfect success. The ancients preserved\r\n    the fruit by placing it, with its branches and leaves, in a\r\n    vessel filled with honey or sweet wine, which was reduced to\r\n    half the quantity by ebullition. Quinces may be profitably\r\n    cultivated in this country as a variety with other fruit-trees,\r\n    and may be planted in espaliers or as standards. A very\r\n    fine-flavoured marmalade may be prepared from quinces, and a\r\n    small portion of quince in apple pie much improves its flavour.\r\n    The French use quinces for flavouring many sauces. This fruit\r\n    has the remarkable peculiarity of exhaling an agreeable odour,\r\n    taken singly; but when in any quantity, or when they are stowed\r\n    away in a drawer or close room, the pleasant aroma becomes an\r\n    intolerable stench, although the fruit may be perfectly sound;\r\n    it is therefore desirable that, as but a few quinces are\r\n    required for keeping, they should be kept in a high and dry\r\n    loft, and out of the way of the rooms used by the family.\r\n\r\nCREAMED APPLE TART.\r\n\r\n1234. INGREDIENTS.--Puff-crust No. 1205 or 1206, apples; to every lb. of\r\npared and cored apples, allow 2 oz. of moist sugar, 1/2 teaspoonful of\r\nminced lemon-peel, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1/2 pint of boiled\r\ncustard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make an apple tart by the preceding recipe, with the exception\r\nof omitting the icing. When the tart is baked, cut out the middle of the\r\nlid or crust, leaving a border all round the dish. Fill up with a\r\nnicely-made boiled custard, grate a little nutmeg over the top, and the\r\npie is ready for table. This tart is usually eaten cold; is rather an\r\nold-fashioned dish, but, at the same time, extremely nice.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE SNOWBALLS.\r\n\r\n1235. INGREDIENTS.--2 teacupfuls of rice, apples, moist sugar, cloves.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the rice in milk until three-parts done; then strain it\r\noff, and pare and core the apples without dividing them. Put a small\r\nquantity of sugar and a clove into each apple, put the rice round them,\r\nand tie each ball separately in a cloth. Boil until the apples are\r\ntender; then take them up, remove the cloths, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to boil the rice separately; 1/2 to 1 hour with the\r\napple.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE TOURTE OR CAKE.\r\n\r\n(_German Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n1236. INGREDIENTS.--10 or 12 apples, sugar to taste, the rind of 1 small\r\nlemon, 3 eggs, 1/4 pint of cream or milk, 1/4 lb. of butter, 3/4 lb. of\r\ngood short crust No. 1211, 3 oz. of sweet almonds.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare, core, and cut the apples into small pieces; put\r\nsufficient moist sugar to sweeten them into a basin; add the lemon-peel,\r\nwhich should be finely minced, and the cream; stir these ingredients\r\nwell, whisk the eggs, and melt the butter; mix altogether, add the\r\nsliced apple, and let these be well stirred into the mixture. Line a\r\nlarge round plate with the paste, place a narrow rim of the same round\r\nthe outer edge, and lay the apples thickly in the middle. Blanch the\r\nalmonds, cut them into long shreds, and strew over the top of the\r\napples, and bake from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, taking care that the almonds do\r\nnot get burnt: when done, strew some sifted sugar over the top, and\r\nserve. This tourte may be eaten either hot or cold, and is sufficient to\r\nfill 2 large-sized plates.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 large-sized tourtes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\n    APPLES.--No fruit is so universally popular as the apple. It is\r\n    grown extensively for cider, but many sorts are cultivated for\r\n    the table. The apple, uncooked, is less digestible than the\r\n    pear; the degree of digestibility varying according to the\r\n    firmness of its texture and flavour. Very wholesome and\r\n    delicious jellies, marmalades, and sweetmeats are prepared from\r\n    it. Entremets of apples are made in great variety. Apples, when\r\n    peeled, cored, and well cooked, are a most grateful food for the\r\n    dyspeptic.\r\n\r\nALMA PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1237. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of fresh butter, 1/2 lb. of powdered sugar,\r\n1/2 lb. of flour, 1/4 lb. of currants, 4 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat the butter to a thick cream, strew in, by degrees, the\r\nsugar, and mix both these well together; then dredge the flour in\r\ngradually, add the currants, and moisten with the eggs, which should be\r\nwell beaten. When all the ingredients are well stirred and mixed, butter\r\na mould that will hold the mixture exactly, tie it down with a cloth,\r\nput the pudding into boiling water, and boil for 5 hours; when turned\r\nout, strew some powdered sugar over it, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--6 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED APRICOT PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1238. INGREDIENTS.--12 large apricots, 3/4 pint of bread crumbs, 1 pint\r\nof milk, 3 oz. of pounded sugar, the yolks of 4 eggs, 1 glass of sherry.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the milk boiling hot, and pour it on to the bread crumbs;\r\nwhen half cold, add the sugar, the well-whisked yolks of the eggs, and\r\nthe sherry. Divide the apricots in half, scald them until they are soft,\r\nand break them up with a spoon, adding a few of the kernels, which\r\nshould be well pounded in a mortar; then mix the fruit and other\r\ningredients together, put a border of paste round the dish, fill with\r\nthe mixture, and bake the pudding from 1/2 to 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour. Average cost, in full season, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in August, September, and October.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRICOT TART.\r\n\r\n1239. INGREDIENTS.--12 or 14 apricots, sugar to taste, puff-paste or\r\nshort crust.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Break the apricots in half, take out the stones, and put them\r\ninto a pie-dish, in the centre of which place a very small cup or jar,\r\nbottom uppermost; sweeten with good moist sugar, but add no water. Line\r\nthe edge of the dish with paste, put on the cover, and ornament the pie\r\nin any of the usual modes. Bake from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, according to size;\r\nand if puff-paste is used, glaze it about 10 minutes before the pie is\r\ndone, and put it into the oven again to set the glaze. Short crust\r\nmerely requires a little sifted sugar sprinkled over it before being\r\nsent to table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, in full season, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in August, September, and October; green ones rather\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Green apricots make very good tarts, but they should be boiled\r\nwith a little sugar and water before they are covered with the crust.\r\n\r\n    APRICOTS.--The apricot is indigenous to the plains of Armenia,\r\n    but is now cultivated in almost every climate, temperate or\r\n    tropical. There are several varieties. The skin of this fruit\r\n    has a perfumed flavour, highly esteemed. A good apricot, when\r\n    perfectly ripe, is an excellent fruit. It has been somewhat\r\n    condemned for its laxative qualities, but this has possibly\r\n    arisen from the fruit having been eaten unripe, or in too great\r\n    excess. Delicate persons should not eat the apricot uncooked,\r\n    without a liberal allowance of powdered sugar. The apricot makes\r\n    excellent jam and marmalade, and there are several foreign\r\n    preparations of it which are considered great luxuries.\r\n\r\nBAKED OR BOILED ARROWROOT PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1240. INGREDIENTS.--2 tablespoonfuls of arrowroot, 1-1/2 pint of milk, 1\r\noz. of butter, the rind of 1/2 lemon, 2 heaped tablespoonfuls of moist\r\nsugar, a little grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the arrowroot with as much cold milk as will make it into a\r\nsmooth batter, moderately thick; put the remainder of the milk into a\r\nstewpan with the lemon-peel, and let it infuse for about 1/2 hour; when\r\nit boils, strain it gently to the batter, stirring it all the time to\r\nkeep it smooth; then add the butter; beat this well in until thoroughly\r\nmixed, and sweeten with moist sugar. Put the mixture into a pie-dish,\r\nround which has been placed a border of paste, grate a little nutmeg\r\nover the top, and bake the pudding from 1 to 1-1/4 hour, in a moderate\r\noven, or boil it the same length of time in a well-buttered basin. To\r\nenrich this pudding, stir to the other ingredients, just before it is\r\nput in the oven, 3 well-whisked eggs, and add a tablespoonful of brandy.\r\nFor a nursery pudding, the addition of the latter ingredients will be\r\nfound quite superfluous, as also the paste round the edge of the dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 to 1-1/4 hour, baked or boiled. _Average cost_, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    _ARROWROOT_.--In India, and in the colonies, by the process of\r\n    rasping, they extract from a vegetable (_Maranta arundinacea_) a\r\n    sediment nearly resembling tapioca. The grated pulp is sifted\r\n    into a quantity of water, from which it is afterwards strained\r\n    and dried, and the sediment thus produced is called arrowroot.\r\n    Its qualities closely resemble those of tapioca.\r\n\r\nA BACHELOR'S PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1241. INGREDIENTS.--4 oz. of grated bread, 4 oz. of currants, 4 oz. of\r\napples, 2 oz. of sugar, 3 eggs, a few drops of essence of lemon, a\r\nlittle grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare, core, and mince the apples very finely, sufficient, when\r\nminced, to make 4 oz.; add to these the currants, which should be well\r\nwashed, the grated bread, and sugar; whisk the eggs, beat these up with\r\nthe remaining ingredients, and, when all is thoroughly mixed, put the\r\npudding into a buttered basin, tie it down with a cloth, and boil for 3\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours. _Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ from August to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKEWELL PUDDING.\r\n\r\n(_Very Rich_.)\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n1242. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of puff-paste, 5 eggs, 6 oz. of sugar, 1/4\r\nlb. of butter, 1 oz. of almonds, jam.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cover a dish with thin paste, and put over this a layer of any\r\nkind of jam, 1/2 inch thick; put the yolks of 5 eggs into a basin with\r\nthe white of 1, and beat these well; add the sifted sugar, the butter,\r\nwhich should be melted, and the almonds, which should be well pounded;\r\nbeat all together until well mixed, then pour it into the dish over the\r\njam, and bake for an hour in a moderate oven.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n1243. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 pint of bread crumbs, 1 pint of milk, 4 eggs, 2\r\noz. of sugar, 3 oz. of butter, 1 oz. of pounded almonds, jam.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the bread crumbs at the bottom of a pie-dish, then over\r\nthem a layer of jam of any kind that may be preferred; mix the milk and\r\neggs together; add the sugar, butter, and pounded almonds; beat fill\r\nwell together; pour it into the dish, and bake in a moderate oven for 1\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_. 1s. 3d. to 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARONESS PUDDING.\r\n\r\n(_Author's Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n1244. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of suet, 3/4 lb. of raisins weighed after\r\nbeing stoned, 3/4 lb. of flour, 1/2 pint of milk, 1/4 saltspoonful of\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Prepare the suet, by carefully freeing it from skin, and chop\r\nit finely; stone the raisins, and cut them in halves, and mix both these\r\ningredients with the salt and flour; moisten the whole with the above\r\nproportion of milk, stir the mixture well, and tie the pudding in a\r\nfloured cloth, which has been previously wrung out in boiling water. Put\r\nthe pudding into a saucepan of boiling water, and let it boil, without\r\nceasing, 4-1/2 hours. Serve merely with plain sifted sugar, a little of\r\nwhich may be sprinkled over the pudding.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter, when fresh fruit is not obtainable.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This pudding the editress cannot too highly recommend. The\r\nrecipe was kindly given to her family by a lady who bore the title here\r\nprefixed to it; and with all who have partaken of it, it is an especial\r\nfavourite. Nothing is of greater consequence, in the above directions,\r\nthan attention to the time of boiling, which should never be _less_ than\r\nthat mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARBERRY TART.\r\n\r\n1245. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of barberries allow 3/4 lb. of lump\r\nsugar; paste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEAF IN PUFF-PASTE.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the barberries from the stalks, and put the fruit into a\r\nstone jar; place this jar in boiling water, and let it simmer very\r\nslowly until the fruit is soft; then put it into a preserving-pan with\r\nthe sugar, and boil gently for 15 minutes; line a tartlet-pan with\r\npaste, bake it, and, when the paste is cold, fill with the barberries,\r\nand ornament the tart with a few baked leaves of paste, cut out, as\r\nshown in the engraving.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to bake the tart.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d. per pint.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in autumn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARBERRY.]\r\n\r\n    BARBERRIES (_Berberris vulgaris_.)--A fruit of such great\r\n    acidity, that even birds refuse to eat it. In this respect, it\r\n    nearly approaches the tamarind. When boiled with sugar, it makes\r\n    a very agreeable preserve or jelly, according to the different\r\n    modes of preparing it. Barberries are also used as a dry\r\n    sweetmeat, and in sugarplums or comfits; are pickled with\r\n    vinegar, and are used for various culinary purposes. They are\r\n    well calculated to allay heat and thirst in persons afflicted\r\n    with fevers. The berries, arranged on bunches of nice curled\r\n    parsley, make an exceedingly pretty garnish for supper-dishes,\r\n    particularly for white meats, like boiled fowl à la Béchamel,\r\n    the three colours, scarlet, green, and white, contrasting so\r\n    well, and producing a very good effect.\r\n\r\nBAKED BATTER PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1246. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/4 pint of milk, 4 tablespoonfuls of flour, 2 oz.\r\nof butter, 4 eggs, a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the flour with a small quantity of cold milk; make the\r\nremainder hot, and pour it on to the flour, keeping the mixture well\r\nstirred; add the butter, eggs, and salt; beat the whole well, and put\r\nthe pudding into a buttered pie-dish; bake for 3/4 hour, and serve with\r\nsweet sauce, wine sauce, or stewed fruit. Baked in small cups, this\r\nmakes very pretty little puddings, and should be eaten with the same\r\naccompaniments as above.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED BATTER PUDDING, with Dried or Fresh Fruit.\r\n\r\n1247. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/4 pint of milk, 4 tablespoonfuls of flour, 3\r\neggs, 2 oz. of finely-shredded suet, 1/4 lb. of currants, a pinch of\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the milk, flour, and eggs to a smooth batter; add a little\r\nsalt, the suet, and the currants, which should be well washed, picked,\r\nand dried; put the mixture into a buttered pie-dish, and bake in a\r\nmoderate oven for 1-1/4 hour. When fresh fruits are in season, this\r\npudding is exceedingly nice, with damsons, plums, red currants,\r\ngooseberries, or apples; when made with these, the pudding must be\r\nthickly sprinkled over with sifted sugar. Boiled batter pudding, with\r\nfruit, is made in the same manner, by putting the fruit into a buttered\r\nbasin, and filling it up with batter made in the above proportion, but\r\nomitting the suet. It must be sent quickly to table, and covered\r\nplentifully with sifted sugar.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Baked batter pudding, with fruit, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour; boiled\r\nditto, 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hour, allowing that both are made with the above\r\nproportion of batter. Smaller puddings will be done enough in 3/4 or 1\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time, with dried fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED BATTER PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1248. INGREDIENTS.--3 eggs, 1 oz. of butter, 1 pint of milk, 3\r\ntablespoonfuls of flour, a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the flour into a basin, and add sufficient milk to moisten\r\nit; carefully rub down all the lumps with a spoon, then pour in the\r\nremainder of the milk, and stir in the butter, which should be\r\npreviously melted; keep beating the mixture, add the eggs and a pinch of\r\nsalt, and when the batter is quite smooth, put it into a well-buttered\r\nbasin, tie it down very tightly, and put it into boiling water; move the\r\nbasin about for a few minutes after it is put into the water, to prevent\r\nthe flour settling in any part, and boil for 1-1/4 hour. This pudding\r\nmay also be boiled in a floured cloth that has been wetted in hot water;\r\nit will then take a few minutes less than when boiled in a basin. Send\r\nthese puddings very quickly to table, and serve with sweet sauce, wine\r\nsauce, stewed fruit, or jam of any kind: when the latter is used, a\r\nlittle of it may be placed round the dish in small quantities, as a\r\ngarnish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/4 hour in a basin, 1 hour in a cloth. _Average cost_, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE BATTER PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1249. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1 pint of milk, 1-1/4 oz. of loaf sugar, 3\r\ntablespoonfuls of flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the batter with the above ingredients, put it into a\r\nwell-buttered basin, tie it down with a cloth, and boil for 1 hour. As\r\nsoon as it is turned out of the basin, put a small jar of orange\r\nmarmalade all over the top, and send the pudding very quickly to table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, with the marmalade, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time; but more suitable for a winter pudding.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED BREAD PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1250. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of grated bread, 1 pint of milk, 4 eggs, 4\r\noz. of butter, 4 oz. of moist sugar, 2 oz. of candied peel, 6 bitter\r\nalmonds, 1 tablespoonful of brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk into a stewpan, with the bitter almonds; let it\r\ninfuse for 1/4 hour; bring it to the boiling point; strain it on to the\r\nbread crumbs, and let these remain till cold; then add the eggs, which\r\nshould be well whisked, the butter, sugar, and brandy, and beat the\r\npudding well until all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed; line the\r\nbottom of a pie-dish with the candied peel sliced thin, put in the\r\nmixture, and bake for nearly 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Nearly 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A few currants may be substituted for the candied peel, and\r\nwill be found an excellent addition to this pudding: they should be\r\nbeaten in with the mixture, and not laid at the bottom of the pie-dish.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERY PLAIN BREAD PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1251. INGREDIENTS.--Odd pieces of crust or crumb of bread; to every\r\nquart allow 1/2 teaspoonful of salt, 1 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 3\r\noz. of moist sugar, 1/2 lb. of currants, 1-1/4 oz. of butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Break the bread into small pieces, and pour on them as much\r\nboiling water as will soak them well. Let these stand till the water is\r\ncool; then press it out, and mash the bread with a fork until it is\r\nquite free from lumps. Measure this pulp, and to every quart stir in\r\nsalt, nutmeg, sugar, and currants in the above proportion; mix all well\r\ntogether, and put it into a well-buttered pie-dish. Smooth the surface\r\nwith the back of a spoon, and place the butter in small pieces over the\r\ntop; bake in a moderate oven for 1-1/2 hour, and serve very hot. Boiling\r\nmilk substituted for the boiling water would very much improve this\r\npudding.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 6d., exclusive of the bread.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED BREAD PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1252. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of milk, 3/4 pint of bread crumbs, sugar\r\nto taste, 4 eggs, 1 oz. of butter, 3 oz. of currants, 1/4 teaspoonful of\r\ngrated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the milk boiling, and pour it on the bread crumbs; let\r\nthese remain till cold; then add the other ingredients, taking care that\r\nthe eggs are well beaten and the currants well washed, picked, and\r\ndried. Beat the pudding well, and put it into a buttered basin; tie it\r\ndown tightly with a cloth, plunge it into boiling water, and boil for\r\n1-1/4 hour; turn it out of the basin, and serve with sifted sugar. Any\r\nodd pieces or scraps of bread answer for this pudding; but they should\r\nbe soaked overnight, and, when wanted for use, should have the water\r\nwell squeezed from them.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/4 hour. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    BREAD.--Bread contains, in its composition, in the form of\r\n    vegetable albumen and vegetable fibrine, two of the chief\r\n    constituents of flesh, and, in its incombustible constituents,\r\n    the salts which are indispensable for sanguification, of the\r\n    same quality and in the same proportion as flesh. But flesh\r\n    contains, besides these, a number of substances which are\r\n    entirely wanting in vegetable food; and on these peculiar\r\n    constituents of flesh depend certain effects, by which it is\r\n    essentially distinguished from other articles of food.\r\n\r\nBROWN-BREAD PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1253. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of brown-bread crumbs, 1/2 lb. of currants,\r\n1/2 lb. of suet, 1/4 lb. of moist sugar, 4 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\nbrandy, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream, grated nutmeg to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Grate 3/4 lb. of crumbs from a stale brown loaf; add to these\r\nthe currants and suet, and be particular that the latter is finely\r\nchopped. Put in the remaining ingredients; beat the pudding well for a\r\nfew minutes; put it into a buttered basin or mould; tie it down tightly,\r\nand boil for nearly 4 hours. Send sweet sauce to table with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Nearly 4 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time; but more suitable for a winter pudding.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINIATURE BREAD PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n1254. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 1/2 lb. of bread crumbs, 4 eggs, 2\r\noz. of butter, sugar to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of brandy, 1 teaspoonful\r\nof finely-minced lemon-peel.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the milk boiling, pour it on to the bread crumbs, and let\r\nthem soak for about 1/2 hour. Beat the eggs, mix these with the bread\r\ncrumbs, add the remaining ingredients, and stir well until all is\r\nthoroughly mixed. Butter some small cups; rather more than half fill\r\nthem with the mixture, and bake in a moderate oven from 20 minutes to\r\n1/2 hour, and serve with sweet sauce. A few currants may be added to\r\nthese puddings: about 3 oz. will be found sufficient for the above\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 small puddings.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED BREAD-AND-BUTTER PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1255. INGREDIENTS.--9 thin slices of bread and butter, 1-1/2 pint of\r\nmilk, 4 eggs, sugar to taste, 1/4 lb. of currants, flavouring of\r\nvanilla, grated lemon-peel or nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut 9 slices of bread and butter not very thick, and put them\r\ninto a pie-dish, with currants between each layer and on the top.\r\nSweeten and flavour the milk, either by infusing a little lemon-peel in\r\nit, or by adding a few drops of essence of vanilla; well whisk the eggs,\r\nand stir these to the milk. _Strain_ this over the bread and butter, and\r\nbake in a moderate oven for 1 hour, or rather longer. This pudding may\r\nbe very much enriched by adding cream, candied peel, or more eggs than\r\nstated above. It should not be turned out, but sent to table in the\r\npie-dish, and is better for being made about 2 hours before it is baked.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour, or rather longer. _Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    BUTTER.--Butter is indispensable in almost all culinary\r\n    preparations. Good fresh butter, used in moderation, is easily\r\n    digested; it is softening, nutritious, and fattening, and is far\r\n    more easily digested than any other of the oleaginous substances\r\n    sometimes used in its place.\r\n\r\nCABINET or CHANCELLOR'S PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1256. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 oz. of candied peel, 4 oz. of currants, 4\r\ndozen sultanas, a few slices of Savoy cake, sponge cake, a French roll,\r\n4 eggs, 1 pint of milk, grated lemon-rind, 1/4 nutmeg, 3 table-spoonfuls\r\nof sugar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CABINET PUDDING.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Melt some butter to a paste, and with it, well grease the mould\r\nor basin in which the pudding is to be boiled, taking care that it is\r\nbuttered in every part. Cut the peel into thin slices, and place these\r\nin a fanciful device at the bottom of the mould, and fill in the spaces\r\nbetween with currants and sultanas; then add a few slices of sponge cake\r\nor French roll; drop a few drops of melted butter on these, and between\r\neach layer sprinkle a few currants. Proceed in this manner until the\r\nmould is nearly full; then flavour the milk with nutmeg and grated\r\nlemon-rind; add the sugar, and stir to this the eggs, which should be\r\nwell beaten. Beat this mixture for a few minutes; then strain it into\r\nthe mould, which should be quite full; tie a piece of buttered paper\r\nover it, and let it stand for 2 hours; then tie it down with a cloth,\r\nput it into boiling water, and let it boil slowly for 1 hour. In taking\r\nit up, let it stand for a minute or two before the cloth is removed;\r\nthen quickly turn it out of the mould or basin, and serve with sweet\r\nsauce separately. The flavouring of this pudding may be varied by\r\nsubstituting for the lemon-rind essence of vanilla or bitter almonds;\r\nand it may be made much richer by using cream; but this is not at all\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLAIN CABINET or BOILED BREAD-AND-BUTTER PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1257.

Care must be taken that the basin is\r\nquite full before the cloth is tied over.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANARY PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1258. INGREDIENTS.--The weight of 3 eggs in sugar and butter, the weight\r\nof 2 eggs in flour, the rind of 1 small lemon, 3 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Melt the butter to a liquid state, but do not allow it to oil;\r\nstir to this the sugar and finely-minced lemon-peel, and gradually\r\ndredge in the flour, keeping the mixture well stirred; whisk the eggs;\r\nadd these to the pudding; beat all the ingredients until thoroughly\r\nblended, and put them into a buttered mould or basin; boil for 2 hours,\r\nand serve with sweet sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED OR BOILED CARROT PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1259.

If to be boiled, put the\r\nmixture into a buttered basin, tie it down with a cloth, and boil for\r\n2-1/2 hours: if to be baked, put it into a pie-dish, and bake for nearly\r\nan hour; turn it out of the dish, strew sifted sugar over it, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 hours to boil; 1 hour to bake. _Average cost_, 1s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n    CARROTS, says Liebig, contain the same kind of sugar as the\r\n    juice of the sugar-cane.\r\n\r\nROYAL COBURG PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1260. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of new milk, 6 oz. of flour, 6 oz. of sugar,\r\n6 oz. of butter, 6 oz. of currants, 6 eggs, brandy and grated nutmeg to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the flour to a smooth batter with the milk, add the\r\nremaining ingredients _gradually_, and when well mixed, put it into four\r\nbasins or moulds half full; bake for 3/4 hour, turn the puddings out on\r\na dish, and serve with wine sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRY TART.\r\n\r\n1261. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of cherries, 2 small tablespoonfuls of\r\nmoist sugar, 1/2 lb. of short crust, No. 1210 or 1211.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the stalks from the cherries, put them, with the sugar,\r\ninto a _deep_ pie-dish just capable of holding them, with a small cup\r\nplaced upside down in the midst of them. Make a short crust with 1/2 lb.\r\nof flour, by either of the recipes 1210 or 1211; lay a border round the\r\nedge of the dish; put on the cover, and ornament the edges; bake in a\r\nbrisk oven from 1/2 hour to 40 minutes; strew finely-sifted sugar over,\r\nand serve hot or cold, although the latter is the more usual mode. It is\r\nmore economical to make two or three tarts at one time, as the trimmings\r\nfrom one tart answer for lining the edges of the dish for another, and\r\nso much paste is not required as when they are made singly. Unless for\r\nfamily use, never make fruit pies in very _large_ dishes; select them,\r\nhowever, as deep as possible.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to 40 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in June, July, and August.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A few currants added to the cherries will be found to impart a\r\nnice piquant taste to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHERRY.]\r\n\r\n    CHERRIES.--According to Lucullus, the cherry-tree was known in\r\n    Asia in the year of Rome 680. Seventy different species of\r\n    cherries, wild and cultivated, exist, which are distinguishable\r\n    from each other by the difference of their form, size, and\r\n    colour. The French distil from cherries a liqueur Darned\r\n    _kirsch-waser_ (_eau de cérises_); the Italians prepare, from a\r\n    cherry called marusca, the liqueur named _marasquin_, sweeter\r\n    and more agreeable than the former. The most wholesome cherries\r\n    have a tender and delicate skin; those with a hard skin should\r\n    be very carefully masticated. Sweetmeats, syrups, tarts,\r\n    entremets, &c., of cherries, are universally approved.\r\n\r\nCOLD PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1262. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1 pint of milk, sugar to taste, a little\r\ngrated lemon-rind, 2 oz. of raisins, 4 tablespoonfuls of marmalade, a\r\nfew slices of sponge cake.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Sweeten the milk with lump sugar, add a little grated\r\nlemon-rind, and stir to this the eggs, which should be well whisked;\r\nline a buttered mould with the raisins, stoned and cut in half; spread\r\nthe slices of cake with the marmalade, and place them in the mould; then\r\npour in the custard, tie the pudding down with paper and a cloth, and\r\nboil gently for 1 hour: when cold, turn it out, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 1d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLEGE PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n1263.

They may be boiled without a cloth: they should then be made into\r\nround balls, and dropped into boiling water, and should be moved about\r\nat first, to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan.\r\nServe with a cut lemon, cold butter, and sifted sugar.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--In a cloth, 1-1/4 hour; without, 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9 d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZANTE CURRANTS.]\r\n\r\n    ZANTE CURRANTS.--The dried fruit which goes by the name of\r\n    currants in grocers' shops is not a currant really, but a small\r\n    kind of grape, chiefly cultivated in the Morea and the Ionian\r\n    Islands, Corfu, Zante, &c. Those of Zante are cultivated in an\r\n    immense plain, under the shelter of mountains, on the shore of\r\n    the island, where the sun has great power, and brings them to\r\n    maturity. When gathered and dried by the sun and air, on mats,\r\n    they are conveyed to magazines, heaped together, and left to\r\n    cake, until ready for shipping. They are then dug out by iron\r\n    crowbars, trodden into casks, and exported. The fertile vale of\r\n    \"Zante the woody\" produces about 9,000,000 lbs. of currants\r\n    annually. In cakes and puddings this delicious little grape is\r\n    most extensively used; in fact, we could not make a plum pudding\r\n    without the currant.\r\n\r\nBOILED CURRANT PUDDING.\r\n\r\n(_Plain and Economical_.)\r\n\r\n1265. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of suet, 1/2 lb. of\r\ncurrants, milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the currants, dry them thoroughly, and pick away any\r\nstalks or grit; chop the suet finely; mix all the ingredients together,\r\nand moisten with sufficient milk to make the pudding into a stiff\r\nbatter; tie it up in a floured cloth, put it into boiling water, and\r\nboil for 3-1/2 hours; serve with a cut lemon, cold butter, and sifted\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK or RED CURRANT PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1266. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of red or black currants, measured with the\r\nstalks, 1/4 lb. of moist sugar, suet crust No. 1215, or butter crust No.\r\n1213.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make, with 3/4 lb. of flour, either a suet crust or butter\r\ncrust (the former is usually made); butter a basin, and line it with\r\npart of the crust; put in the currants, which should be stripped from\r\nthe stalks, and sprinkle the sugar over them; put the cover of the\r\npudding on; make the edges very secure, that the juice does not escape;\r\ntie it down with a floured cloth, put it into boiling water, and boil\r\nfrom 2-1/2 to 3 hours. Boiled without a basin, allow 1/2 hour less. We\r\nhave allowed rather a large proportion of sugar; but we find fruit\r\npuddings are so much more juicy and palatable when _well sweetened_\r\nbefore they are boiled, besides being more economical. A few raspberries\r\nadded to red-currant pudding are a very nice addition: about 1/2 pint\r\nwould be sufficient for the above quantity of fruit. Fruit puddings are\r\nvery delicious if, when they are turned out of the basin, the crust is\r\nbrowned with a salamander, or put into a very hot oven for a few minutes\r\nto colour it: this makes it crisp on the surface.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 to 3 hours; without a basin, 2 to 2-1/2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in June, July, and August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURRANTS.]\r\n\r\n    CURRANTS.--The utility of currants, red, black, or white, has\r\n    long been established in domestic economy. The juice of the red\r\n    species, if boiled with an equal weight of loaf sugar, forms an\r\n    agreeable substance called _currant jelly_, much employed in\r\n    sauces, and very valuable in the cure of sore throats and colds.\r\n    The French mix it with sugar and water, and thus form an\r\n    agreeable beverage. The juice of currants is a valuable remedy\r\n    in obstructions of the bowels; and, in febrile complaints, it is\r\n    useful on account of its readily quenching thirst, and for its\r\n    cooling effect on the stomach. White and flesh-coloured\r\n    currants have, with the exception of the fullness of flavour, in\r\n    every respect, the same qualities as the red species. Both white\r\n    and red currants are pleasant additions to the dessert, but the\r\n    black variety is mostly used for culinary and medicinal\r\n    purposes, especially in the form of jelly for quinsies. The\r\n    leaves of the black currant make a pleasant tea.\r\n\r\nRED-CURRANT AND RASPBERRY TART.\r\n\r\n1267. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of picked currants, 1/2 pint of\r\nraspberries, 3 heaped tablespoonfuls of moist sugar, 1/2 lb. of short\r\ncrust.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Strip the currants from the stalks, and put them into a deep\r\npie-dish, with a small cup placed in the midst, bottom upwards; add the\r\nraspberries and sugar; place a border of paste round the edge of the\r\ndish, cover with crust, ornament the edges, and bake from 1/2 to 3/4\r\nhour: strew some sifted sugar over before being sent to table. This tart\r\nis more generally served cold than hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in June, July, and August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RASPBERRY.]\r\n\r\n    RASPBERRIES.--There are two sorts of raspberries, the red and\r\n    the white. Both the scent and flavour of this fruit are very\r\n    refreshing, and the berry itself is exceedingly wholesome, and\r\n    invaluable to people of a nervous or bilious temperament. We are\r\n    not aware, however, of its being cultivated with the same amount\r\n    of care which is bestowed upon some other of the berry tribe,\r\n    although it is far from improbable that a more careful\r\n    cultivation would not be repaid by a considerable improvement in\r\n    the size and flavour of the berry; neither, as an eating fruit,\r\n    is it so universally esteemed as the strawberry, with whose\r\n    lusciousness and peculiarly agreeable flavour it can bear no\r\n    comparison. In Scotland, it is found in large quantities,\r\n    growing wild, and is eagerly sought after, in the woods, by\r\n    children. Its juice is rich and abundant, and to many, extremely\r\n    agreeable.\r\n\r\nBAKED CUSTARD PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1268. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of milk, the rind of 1/4 lemon, 1/4 lb.\r\nof moist sugar, 4 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk into a saucepan with the sugar and lemon-rind, and\r\nlet this infuse for about 4 hour, or until the milk is well flavoured;\r\nwhisk the eggs, yolks and whites; pour the milk to them, stirring all\r\nthe while; then have ready a pie-dish, lined at the edge with paste\r\nready baked; strain the custard into the dish, grate a little nutmeg\r\nover the top, and bake in a _very slow_ oven for about 1/2 hour, or\r\nrather longer. The flavour of this pudding may be varied by substituting\r\nbitter almonds for the lemon-rind; and it may be very much enriched by\r\nusing half cream and half milk, and doubling the quantity of eggs.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--This pudding is usually served cold with fruit tarts.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED CUSTARD PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1269. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 4 eggs,\r\nflavouring to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Flavour the milk by infusing in it a little lemon-rind or\r\ncinnamon; whisk the eggs, stir the flour gradually to these, and pour\r\nover them the milk, and stir the mixture well. Butter a basin that will\r\nexactly hold it; put in the custard, and tie a floured cloth over;\r\nplunge it into boiling water, and turn it about for a few minutes, to\r\nprevent the flour from settling in one part. Boil it slowly for 1/2\r\nhour; turn it out of the basin, and serve. The pudding may be garnished\r\nwith red-currant jelly, and sweet sauce may be sent to table with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMSON TART.\r\n\r\n1270. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/4 pint of damsons, 1/4 lb. of moist sugar, 1/2\r\nlb. of short or puff crust.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the damsons, with the sugar between them, into a deep\r\npie-dish, in the midst of which, place a small cup or jar turned upside\r\ndown; pile the fruit high in the middle, line the edges of the dish with\r\nshort or puff crust, whichever may be preferred; put on the cover,\r\nornament the edges, and bake from 1/2 to 3/4 hour in a good oven. If\r\npuff-crust is used, about 10 minutes before the pie is done, take it out\r\nof the oven, brush it over with the white of an egg beaten to a froth\r\nwith the blade of a knife; strew some sifted sugar over, and a few drops\r\nof water, and put the tart back to finish baking: with short crust, a\r\nlittle plain sifted sugar, sprinkled over, is all that will be required.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in September and October.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAMSONS.]\r\n\r\n    DAMSONS.--Whether for jam, jelly, pie, pudding, water, ice,\r\n    wine, dried fruit or preserved, the damson, or _damascene_ (for\r\n    it was originally brought from Damascus, whence its name), is\r\n    invaluable. It combines sugary and acid qualities in happy\r\n    proportions, when full ripe. It is a fruit easily cultivated;\r\n    and, if budded nine inches from the ground on vigorous stocks,\r\n    it will grow several feet high in the first year, and make fine\r\n    standards the year following. Amongst the list of the best sorts\r\n    of baking plums, the damson stands first, not only on account of\r\n    the abundance of its juice, but also on account of its soon\r\n    softening. Because of the roughness of its flavour, it requires\r\n    a large quantity of sugar.\r\n\r\nDAMSON PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1271. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of damsons, 1/4 lb. of moist sugar, 3/4\r\nlb. of suet or butter crust.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a suet crust with 3/4 lb. of flour by recipe No. 1215;\r\nline a buttered pudding-basin with a portion of it; fill the basin with\r\nthe damsons, sweeten them, and put on the lid; pinch the edges of the\r\ncrust together, that the juice does not escape; tie over a floured\r\ncloth, put the pudding into boiling water, and boil from 2-1/2 to 3\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 to 3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELHI PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1272.

INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of rice, 2 oz. of butter, 3 eggs, jam,\r\nsufficient milk to soften the rice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the rice in the milk until very soft; then add the butter\r\nboil it for a few minutes after the latter ingredient is put in, and set\r\nit by to cool. Well beat the eggs, stir these in, and line a dish with\r\npuff-paste; put over this a layer of rice, then a thin layer of any kind\r\nof jam, then another layer of rice, and proceed in this manner until the\r\ndish is full; and bake in a moderate oven for 3/4 hour. This pudding may\r\nbe eaten hot or cold; if the latter, it will be much improved by having\r\na boiled custard poured over it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXETER PUDDING.\r\n\r\n(_Very rich_.)\r\n\r\n1274.

When sufficiently risen, mix the eggs, butter,\r\nsugar, and salt with a little more warm milk, and knead the whole well\r\ntogether with the hands, beating the dough until it is perfectly smooth,\r\nand it drops from the fingers. Then cover the basin with a cloth, put it\r\nin a warm place, and when the dough has nicely risen, knead it into\r\nsmall balls; butter the bottom of a deep sauté-pan, strew over some\r\npounded sugar, and let the dampfnudeln be laid in, but do not let them\r\ntouch one another; then pour over sufficient milk to cover them, put on\r\nthe lid, and let them rise to twice their original size by the side of\r\nthe fire. Now place them in the oven for a few minutes, to acquire a\r\nnice brown colour, and serve them on a napkin, with custard sauce\r\nflavoured with vanilla, or a _compôte_ of any fruit that may be\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour for the sponge to rise; 10 to 15 minutes for\r\nthe puddings to rise; 10 minutes to bake them in a brisk oven.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 or 12 dampfnudeln.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nGINGER PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1281.

When turned\r\nout, strew a little fine-sifted sugar over the top, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 11d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The mould may be ornamented with stoned raisins, arranged in\r\nany fanciful pattern, before the mixture is poured in, which would add\r\nvery much to the appearance of the pudding. For a plainer pudding,\r\ndouble the quantities of the bread crumbs, and if the eggs do not\r\nmoisten it sufficiently, use a little milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED GOOSEBERRY PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1283. INGREDIENTS.--Gooseberries, 3 eggs, 1-1/2 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint\r\nof bread crumbs, sugar to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the gooseberries into a jar, previously cutting off the\r\ntops and tails; place this jar in boiling water, and let it boil until\r\nthe gooseberries are soft enough to pulp; then beat them through a\r\ncoarse sieve, and to every pint of pulp add 3 well-whisked eggs, 1-1/2\r\noz. of butter, 1/2 pint of bread crumbs, and sugar to taste; beat the\r\nmixture well, put a border of puff-paste round the edge of a pie-dish,\r\nput in the pudding, bake for about 40 minutes, strew sifted sugar over,\r\nand serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 40 minutes. _Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ from May to July.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED GOOSEBERRY PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1284.

A jug of cream, or a dish of boiled or baked\r\ncustards, should always accompany this dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from May to July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOOSEBERRY.]\r\n\r\n    GOOSEBERRIES.--The red and the white are the two principal\r\n    varieties of gooseberries. The red are rather the more acid;\r\n    but, when covered with white sugar, are most wholesome, because\r\n    the sugar neutralizes their acidity. Red gooseberries make an\r\n    excellent jelly, which is light and refreshing, but not very\r\n    nourishing. It is good for bilious and plethoric persons, and to\r\n    invalids generally who need light and digestible food. It is a\r\n    fruit from which many dishes might be made. All sorts of\r\n    gooseberries are agreeable when stewed, and, in this country\r\n    especially, there is no fruit so universally in favour. In\r\n    Scotland, there is scarcely a cottage-garden without its\r\n    gooseberry-bush. Several of the species are cultivated with the\r\n    nicest care.\r\n\r\nHALF-PAY PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1286.

The juice of this\r\n    fruit makes one of our most popular and refreshing\r\n    beverages--lemonade, which is gently stimulating and cooling,\r\n    and soon quenches the thirst. It may he freely partaken by\r\n    bilious and sanguine temperaments; but persons with irritable\r\n    stomachs should avoid it, on account of its acid qualities. The\r\n    fresh rind of the lemon is a gentle tonic, and, when dried and\r\n    grated, is used in flavouring a variety of culinary\r\n    preparations. Lemons appear in company with the orange in most\r\n    orange-growing countries. They were only known to the Romans at\r\n    a very late period, and, at first, were used only to keep the\r\n    moths from their garments: their acidity was unpleasant to them.\r\n    In the time of Pliny, the lemon was hardly known otherwise than\r\n    as an excellent counter-poison.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n(_Very rich_.)\r\n\r\n1297.

Grate a little nutmeg over the\r\ntop, and bake in a moderate oven for 1/2 hour.

That of smaller diameter\r\n    than macaroni (which is about the thickness of a goose-quill) is\r\n    called _vermicelli_; and when smaller still, _fidelini_. The\r\n    finest is made from the flour of the hard-grained Black-Sea\r\n    wheat. Macaroni is the principal article of food in many parts\r\n    of Italy, particularly Naples, where the best is manufactured,\r\n    and from whence, also, it is exported in considerable\r\n    quantities. In this country, macaroni and vermicelli are\r\n    frequently used in soups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACARONI.]\r\n\r\nMANNA KROUP PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1302.

The preparation is white\r\n    when it is made only of these materials; the yellow colour which\r\n    it usually has, is produced by a portion of saffron and yolks of\r\n    eggs. Next to vermicelli, this preparation is the most useful\r\n    for thickening either meat or vegetable soups. As a food, it is\r\n    light, nutritious, wholesome, and easily digested. The best\r\n    preparation is brought from Arabia, and, next to that, from\r\n    Italy.\r\n\r\nMANSFIELD PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1303.

INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of raisins, 3 lbs. of currants, 1-1/2 lb. of\r\nlean beef, 3 lbs. of beef suet, 2 lbs. of moist sugar, 2 oz. of citron,\r\n2 oz. of candied lemon-peel, 2 oz. of candied orange-peel, 1 small\r\nnutmeg, 1 pottle of apples, the rind of 2 lemons, the juice of 1, 1/2\r\npint of brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Stone and _cut_ the raisins once or twice across, but do not\r\nchop them; wash, dry, and pick the currants free from stalks and grit,\r\nand mince the beef and suet, taking care that the latter is chopped very\r\nfine; slice the citron and candied peel, grate the nutmeg, and pare,\r\ncore, and mince the apples; mince the lemon-peel, strain the juice, and\r\nwhen all the ingredients are thus prepared, mix them well together,\r\nadding the brandy when the other things are well blended; press the\r\nwhole into a jar, carefully exclude the air, and the mincemeat will be\r\nready for use in a fortnight.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 8s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this about the beginning of December.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCELLENT MINCEMEAT.\r\n\r\n1310. INGREDIENTS.--3 large lemons, 3 large apples, 1 lb. of stoned\r\nraisins, 1 lb. of currants, 1 lb. of suet, 2 lbs. of moist sugar, 1 oz.\r\nof sliced candied citron, 1 oz. of sliced candied orange-peel, and the\r\nsame quantity of lemon-peel, 1 teacupful of brandy, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\norange marmalade.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Grate the rinds of the lemons; squeeze out the juice, strain\r\nit, and boil the remainder of the lemons until tender enough to pulp or\r\nchop very finely. Then add to this pulp the apples, which should be\r\nbaked, and their skins and cores removed; put in the remaining\r\ningredients one by one, and, as they are added, mix everything very\r\nthoroughly together. Put the mincemeat into a stone jar with a\r\nclosely-fitting lid, and in a fortnight it will be ready for use.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This should be made the first or second week in December.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINCE PIES.\r\n\r\n1311. INGREDIENTS.--Good puff-paste No. 1205, mincemeat No. 1309.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINCE PIES.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make some good puff-paste by recipe No. 1205; roll it out to\r\nthe thickness of about 1/4 inch, and line some good-sized pattypans with\r\nit; fill them with mincemeat, cover with the paste, and cut it off all\r\nround close to the edge of the tin. Put the pies into a brisk oven, to\r\ndraw the paste up, and bake for 25 minutes, or longer, should the pies\r\nbe very large; brush them over with the white of an egg, beaten with the\r\nblade of a knife to a stiff froth; sprinkle over pounded sugar, and put\r\nthem into the oven for a minute or two, to dry the egg; dish the pies on\r\na white d'oyley, and serve hot. They may be merely sprinkled with\r\npounded sugar instead of being glazed, when that mode is preferred. To\r\nre-warm them, put the pies on the pattypans, and let them remain in the\r\noven for 10 minutes or 1/4 hour, and they will be almost as good as if\r\nfreshly made.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--25 to 30 minutes; 10 minutes to re-warm them.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_--1/2 lb. of paste for 4 pies. _Seasonable_ at Christmas\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY'S PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1312. INGREDIENTS.--The remains of cold plum-pudding, brandy, custard\r\nmade with 5 eggs to every pint of milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the remains of a _good_ cold plum-pudding into\r\nfinger-pieces, soak them in a little brandy, and lay them cross-barred\r\nin a mould until full. Make a custard with the above proportion of milk\r\nand eggs, flavouring it with nutmeg or lemon-rind; fill up the mould\r\nwith it; tie it down with a cloth, and boil or steam it for an hour.\r\nServe with a little of the custard poured over, to which has been added\r\na tablespoonful of brandy.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the pudding, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nNESSELRODE PUDDING. (_A fashionable iced pudding--Carême's Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n1313. INGREDIENTS.--40 chestnuts, 1 lb. of sugar, flavouring of vanilla,\r\n1 pint of cream, the yolks of 12 eggs, 1 glass of Maraschino, 1 oz. of\r\ncandied citron, 2 oz. of currants, 2 oz. of stoned raisins, 1/2 pint of\r\nwhipped cream, 3 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Blanch the chestnuts in boiling water, remove the husks, and\r\npound them in a mortar until perfectly smooth, adding a few spoonfuls of\r\nsyrup. Then rub them through a fine sieve, and mix them in a basin with\r\na pint of syrup made from 1 lb. of sugar, clarified, and flavoured with\r\nvanilla, 1 pint of cream, and the yolks of 12 eggs. Set this mixture\r\nover a slow fire, stirring it _without ceasing_, and just as it begins\r\nto boil, take it off and pass it through a tammy. When it is cold, put\r\nit into a freezing-pot, adding the Maraschino, and make the mixture set;\r\nthen add the sliced citron, the currants, and stoned raisins (these two\r\nlatter should be soaked the day previously in Maraschino and sugar\r\npounded with vanilla); the whole thus mingled, add a plateful of whipped\r\ncream mixed with the whites of 3 eggs, beaten to a froth with a little\r\nsyrup. When the pudding is perfectly frozen, put it into a\r\npineapple-shaped mould; close the lid, place it again in the\r\nfreezing-pan, covered over with pounded ice and saltpetre, and let it\r\nremain until required for table; then turn the pudding out, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to freeze the mixture.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from October to February.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED ORANGE PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1314. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of stale sponge cake or bruised ratafias, 6\r\noranges, 1 pint of milk, 6 eggs, 1/2 lb. of sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Bruise the sponge cake or ratafias into fine crumbs, and pour\r\nupon them the milk, which should be boiling. Rub the rinds of 2 of the\r\noranges on sugar, and add this, with the juice of the remainder, to the\r\nother ingredients. Beat up the eggs, stir them in, sweeten to taste, and\r\nput the mixture into a pie-dish previously lined with puff-paste. Bake\r\nfor rather more than 1/2 hour; turn it out of the dish, strew sifted\r\nsugar over, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons. _Seasonable_ from November to May.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORANGE.]\r\n\r\n    ORANGE (_Citrus Aurantium_).--The principal varieties are the\r\n    sweet, or China orange, and the bitter, or Seville orange; the\r\n    Maltese is also worthy of notice, from its red blood-like pulp.\r\n    The orange is extensively cultivated in the south of Europe, and\r\n    in Devonshire, on walls with a south aspect, it bears an\r\n    abundance of fruit. So great is the increase in the demand for\r\n    the orange, and so ample the supply, that it promises to rival\r\n    the apple in its popularity. The orange-tree is considered young\r\n    at the age of a hundred years. The pulp of the orange consists\r\n    of a collection of oblong vesicles filled with a sugary and\r\n    refreshing juice. The orange blossom is proverbially chosen for\r\n    the bridal wreath, and, from the same flower, an essential oil\r\n    is extracted hardly less esteemed than the celebrated ottar of\r\n    roses. Of all marmalades, that made from the Seville orange is\r\n    the best. The peel and juice of the orange are much used in\r\n    culinary preparations. From oranges are made preserves,\r\n    comfitures, jellies, glacés, sherbet, liqueurs, and syrups. The\r\n    juice of the orange in a glass _d'eau sucrée_ makes a refreshing\r\n    and wholesome drink. From the clarified pulp of the orange the\r\n    French make a delicious jelly, which they serve in small pots,\r\n    and call _crême_. The rasped peel of the orange is used in\r\n    several sweet _entremets_, to which it communicates its perfume.\r\n    The confectioner manufactures a variety of dainties from all\r\n    parts of the orange. Confections of orange-peel are excellent\r\n    tonics and stomachics. Persons with delicate stomachs should\r\n    abstain from oranges at dessert, because their acidity is likely\r\n    to derange the digestive organs.\r\n\r\nSMALL DISHES OF PASTRY FOR ENTREMETS, SUPPER-DISHES, &c.\r\n\r\nFANCHONNETTES, or CUSTARD TARTLETS.\r\n\r\n1315. INGREDIENTS.--For the custard, 4 eggs, 3/4 pint of milk, 2 oz. of\r\nbutter, 2 oz. of pounded sugar, 3 dessertspoonfuls of flour, flavouring\r\nto taste; the whites of 2 eggs, 2 oz. of pounded sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Well beat the eggs; stir to them the milk, the butter, which\r\nshould be beaten to a cream, the sugar, and flour; mix these ingredients\r\nwell together, put them into a very clean saucepan, and bring them to\r\nthe simmering point, but do not allow them to boil. Flavour with essence\r\nof vanilla, bitter almonds, lemon, grated chocolate, or any flavouring\r\ningredient that may be preferred. Line some round tartlet-pans with good\r\npuff-paste; fill them with the custard, and bake in a moderate oven for\r\nabout 20 minutes; then take them out of the pans; let them cool, and in\r\nthe mean time whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth; stir into\r\nthis the pounded sugar, and spread smoothly over the tartlets a little\r\nof this mixture. Put them in the oven again to set the icing, but be\r\nparticular that they do not scorch: when the icing looks crisp, they are\r\ndone. Arrange them, piled high in the centre, on a white napkin, and\r\ngarnish the dish, and in between the tartlets, with strips of bright\r\njelly, or very firmly-made preserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to bake the tartlets; 5 minutes after being iced.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the paste, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill 10 or 12 tartlets.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The icing may be omitted on the top of the tartlets, and a\r\nspoonful of any kind of preserve put at the bottom of the custard\r\ninstead: this varies both the flavour and appearance of this dish.\r\n\r\n\r\nALMOND FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n1316. INGREDIENTS.--Puff-paste No. 1205; to every 1/2 lb. of paste allow\r\n3 oz. of almonds, sifted sugar, the white of an egg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Roll the paste out to the thickness of 1/4 inch, and, with a\r\nround fluted cutter, stamp out as many pieces as may be required. Work\r\nthe paste up again, roll it out, and, with a smaller cutter, stamp out\r\nsome pieces the size of a shilling. Brush the larger pieces over with\r\nthe white of an egg, and place one of the smaller pieces on each. Blanch\r\nand cut the almonds into strips lengthwise; press them slanting into the\r\npaste closely round the rings; and when they are all completed, sift\r\nover some pounded sugar, and bake for about 1/4 hour or 20 minutes.\r\nGarnish between the almonds with strips of apple jelly, and place in the\r\ncentre of the ring a small quantity of strawberry jam; pile them high on\r\nthe dish, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour or 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--18 or 20 for a dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLUTED ROLLS.\r\n\r\n1317. INGREDIENTS.--Puff-paste, the white of an egg, sifted sugar, jelly\r\nor preserve.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make some good puff-paste by recipe No. 1205 (trimmings answer\r\nvery well for little dishes of this sort); roll it out to the thickness\r\nof 1/4 inch, and, with a round fluted paste-cutter, stamp out as many\r\nround pieces as may be required; brush over the upper side with the\r\nwhite of an egg; roll up the pieces, pressing the paste lightly together\r\nwhere it joins; place the rolls on a baking-sheet, and bake for about\r\n1/4 hour. A few minutes before they are done, brush them over with the\r\nwhite of an egg; strew over sifted sugar, put them back in the oven; and\r\nwhen the icing is firm and of a pale brown colour, they are done. Place\r\na strip of jelly or preserve across each roll, dish them high on a\r\nnapkin, and serve cold.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour before being iced; 5 to 10 minutes after.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--1/2 lb. of puff-paste for 2 dishes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASTRY SANDWICHES.\r\n\r\n1318. INGREDIENTS.--Puff-paste, jam of any kind, the white of an egg,\r\nsifted sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Roll the paste out thin; put half of it on a baking-sheet or\r\ntin, and spread equally over it apricot, greengage, or any preserve that\r\nmay be preferred. Lay over this preserve another thin paste; press the\r\nedges together all round; and mark the paste in lines with a knife on\r\nthe surface, to show where to cut it when baked. Bake from 20 minutes to\r\n1/2 hour; and, a short time before being done, take the pastry out of\r\nthe oven, brush it over with the white of an egg, sift over pounded\r\nsugar, and put it back in the oven to colour. When cold, cut it into\r\nstrips; pile these on a dish pyramidically, and serve. These strips, cut\r\nabout 2 inches long, piled in circular rows, and a plateful of flavoured\r\nwhipped cream poured in the middle, make a very pretty dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to 1 hour. _Average cost_, with 1/2 lb. of paste,\r\n1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--1/2 lb. of paste will make 2 dishes of sandwiches.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\nPETITES BOUCHEES.\r\n\r\n1319. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of sweet almonds, 1/4 lb. of sifted sugar,\r\nthe rind of 1/2 lemon, the white of 1 egg, puff-paste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Blanch the almonds, and chop them fine; rub the sugar on the\r\nlemon-rind, and pound it in a mortar; mix this with the almonds and the\r\nwhite of the egg. Roll some puff-paste out; cut it in any shape that may\r\nbe preferred, such as diamonds, rings, ovals, &c., and spread the above\r\nmixture over the paste. Bake the bouchées in an oven, not too hot, and\r\nserve cold.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour, or rather more. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1/2 lb. of puff-paste. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLISH TARTLETS.\r\n\r\n1320. INGREDIENTS.--Puff-paste, the white of an egg, pounded sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Roll some good puff-paste out thin, and cut it into 2-1/2-inch\r\nsquares; brush each square over with the white of an egg, then fold down\r\nthe corners, so that they all meet in the middle of each piece of paste;\r\nslightly press the two pieces together, brush them over with the egg,\r\nsift over sugar, and bake in a nice quick oven for about 1/4 hour. When\r\nthey are done, make a little hole in the middle of the paste, and fill\r\nit up with apricot jam, marmalade, or red-currant jelly. Pile them high\r\nin the centre of a dish, on a napkin, and garnish with the same preserve\r\nthe tartlets are filled with.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour or 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with 1/2 lb. of puff-paste, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 dishes of pastry.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--It should be borne in mind, that, for all dishes of small\r\npastry, such as the preceding, trimmings of puff-pasty, left from larger\r\ntarts, answer as well as making the paste expressly.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUITS d'AMOUR, or PUFF-PASTE RINGS.\r\n\r\n1321. INGREDIENTS.--Puff-paste No. 1205, the white of an egg, sifted\r\nloaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make some good puff-paste by recipe No. 1205; roll it out to\r\nthe thickness of about 1/4 inch, and, with a round fluted paste-cutter,\r\nstamp out as many pieces as may be required; then work the paste up\r\nagain, and roll it out to the same thickness, and with a smaller cutter,\r\nstamp out sufficient pieces to correspond with the larger ones. Again\r\nstamp out the centre of these smaller rings; brush over the others with\r\nthe white of an egg, place a small ring on the top of every large\r\ncircular piece of paste, egg over the tops, and bake from 15 to 20\r\nminutes. Sift over sugar, put them back in the oven to colour them; then\r\nfill the rings with preserve of any bright colour. Dish them high on a\r\nnapkin, and serve. So many pretty dishes of pastry may be made by\r\nstamping puff-paste out with fancy cutters, and filling the pieces, when\r\nbaked, with jelly or preserve, that our space will not allow us to give\r\na separate recipe for each of them; but, as they are all made from one\r\npaste, and only the shape and garnishing varied, perhaps it is not\r\nnecessary, and by exercising a little ingenuity, variety may always be\r\nobtained. Half-moons, leaves, diamonds, stars, shamrocks, rings, etc.,\r\nare the most appropriate shapes for fancy pastry.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 to 25 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with 1/2 lb. of paste, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 dishes of pastry.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARADISE PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1322. INGREDIENTS.--3 eggs, 3 apples, 1/4 lb. of bread crumbs, 3 oz. of\r\nsugar, 3 oz. of currants, salt and grated nutmeg to taste, the rind of\r\n1/2 lemon, 1/2 wineglassful of brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare, core, and mince the apples into small pieces, and mix\r\nthem with the other dry ingredients; beat up the eggs, moisten the\r\nmixture with these, and beat it well; stir in the brandy, and put the\r\npudding into a buttered mould; tie it down with a cloth, boil for 1-1/2\r\nhour, and serve with sweet sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEASE PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1323. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of split peas, 2 oz. of butter, 2 eggs,\r\npepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the peas to soak over-night, in rain-water, and float off\r\nany that are wormeaten or discoloured. Tie them loosely in a clean\r\ncloth, leaving a little room for them to swell, and put them on to boil\r\nin cold rain-water, allowing 2-1/2 hours after the water has simmered\r\nup. When the peas are tender, take them up and drain; rub them through a\r\ncolander with a wooden spoon; add the butter, eggs, pepper, and salt;\r\nbeat all well together for a few minutes, until the ingredients are well\r\nincorporated; then tie them tightly in a floured cloth; boil the pudding\r\nfor another hour, turn it on to the dish, and serve very hot. This\r\npudding should always be sent to table with boiled leg of pork, and is\r\nan exceedingly nice accompaniment to boiled beef.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 hours to boil the peas, tied loosely in the cloth; 1 hour\r\nfor the pudding.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED PLUM-PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1324. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of flour, 1 lb. of currants, 1 lb. of\r\nraisins, 1 lb. of suet, 2 eggs, 1 pint of milk, a few slices of candied\r\npeel.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the suet finely; mix with it the flour, currants, stoned\r\nraisins, and candied peel; moisten with the well-beaten eggs, and add\r\nsufficient milk to make the pudding of the consistency of very thick\r\nbatter. Put it into a buttered dish, and bake in a good oven from 2-1/4\r\nto 2-1/2 hours; turn it out, strew sifted sugar over, and serve. For a\r\nvery plain pudding, use only half the quantity of fruit, omit the eggs,\r\nand substitute milk or water for them. The above ingredients make a\r\nlarge family pudding; for a small one, half the quantity would be found\r\nample; but it must be baked quite 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Large pudding, 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 hours; half the size, 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 9 or 10 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAISIN-GRAPE.]\r\n\r\n    RAISIN GRAPE.--All the kinds of raisins have much the same\r\n    virtues; they are nutritive and balsamic, but they are very\r\n    subject to fermentation with juices of any kind; and hence, when\r\n    eaten immoderately, they often bring on colics. There are many\r\n    varieties of grape used for raisins; the fruit of Valencia is\r\n    that mostly dried for culinary purposes, whilst most of the\r\n    table kinds are grown in Malaga, and called Muscatels. The\r\n    finest of all table raisins come from Provence or Italy; the\r\n    most esteemed of all are those of Roquevaire; they are very\r\n    large and very sweet. This sort is rarely eaten by any but the\r\n    most wealthy. The dried Malaga, or Muscatel raisins, which come\r\n    to this country packed in small boxes, and nicely preserved in\r\n    bunches, are variable in their quality, but mostly of a rich\r\n    flavour, when new, juicy, and of a deep purple hue.\r\n\r\nAN EXCELLENT PLUM-PUDDING, made without Eggs.\r\n\r\n1325. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of flour, 6 oz. of raisins, 6 oz. of\r\ncurrants, 1/4 lb. of chopped suet, 1/4 lb. of brown sugar, 1/4 lb. of\r\nmashed carrot, 1/4 lb. of mashed potatoes, 1 tablespoonful of treacle, 1\r\noz. of candied lemon-peel, 1 oz. of candied citron.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the flour, currants, suet, and sugar well together; have\r\nready the above proportions of mashed carrot and potato, which stir into\r\nthe other ingredients; add the treacle and lemon-peel; but put no liquid\r\nin the mixture, or it will be spoiled. Tie it loosely in a cloth, or, if\r\nput in a basin, do not quite fill it, as the pudding should have room to\r\nswell, and boil it for 4 hours. Serve with brandy-sauce. This pudding is\r\nbetter for being mixed over-night.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN UNRIVALLED PLUM-PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1326. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of muscatel raisins, 1-3/4 lb. of\r\ncurrants, 1 lb. of sultana raisins, 2 lbs. of the finest moist sugar, 2\r\nlbs. of bread crumbs, 16 eggs, 2 lbs. of finely-chopped suet, 6 oz. of\r\nmixed candied peel, the rind of 2 lemons, 1 oz. of ground nutmeg, 1 oz.\r\nof ground cinnamon, 1/2 oz. of pounded bitter almonds, 1/4 pint of\r\nbrandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Stone and cut up the raisins, but do not chop them; wash and\r\ndry the currants, and cut the candied peel into thin slices. Mix all the\r\ndry ingredients well together, and moisten with the eggs, which should\r\nbe well beaten and strained, to the pudding; stir in the brandy, and,\r\nwhen all is thoroughly mixed, well butter and flour a stout new\r\npudding-cloth; put in the pudding, tie it down very tightly and closely,\r\nboil from 6 to 8 hours, and serve with brandy-sauce. A few sweet\r\nalmonds, blanched and cut in strips, and stuck on the pudding, ornament\r\nit prettily. This quantity may be divided and boiled in buttered moulds.\r\nFor small families this is the most desirable way, as the above will be\r\nfound to make a pudding of rather large dimensions.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--6 to 8 hours. _Average cost_, 7s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter. _Sufficient_ for 12 or 14 persons.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The muscatel raisins can be purchased at a cheap rate loose\r\n(not in bunches): they are then scarcely higher in price than the\r\nordinary raisins, and impart a much richer flavour to the pudding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  SULTANA GRAPE.]\r\n\r\n    SULTANA GRAPE.--We have elsewhere stated that the small black\r\n    grape grown in Corinth and the Ionian Isles is, when dried, the\r\n    common currant of the grocers' shops; the white or yellow grape,\r\n    grown in the same places, is somewhat larger than the black\r\n    variety, and is that which produces the Sultana raisin. It has\r\n    been called Sultana from its delicate qualities and unique\r\n    growth: the finest are those of Smyrna. They have not sufficient\r\n    flavour and sugary properties to serve alone for puddings and\r\n    cakes, but they are peculiarly valuable for mixing, that is to\r\n    say, for introducing in company with the richer sorts of\r\n    Valencias or Muscatels. In white puddings, or cakes, too, where\r\n    the whiteness must be preserved, the Sultana raisin should be\r\n    used. But the greatest value of this fruit in the _cuisine_ is\r\n    that of its saving labour; for it has no stones. Half Muscatels\r\n    and half Sultanas are an admirable mixture for general purposes.\r\n\r\nA PLAIN CHRISTMAS PUDDING FOR CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n1327. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 1 lb. of bread crumbs, 3/4 lb. of\r\nstoned raisins, 3/4 lb. of currants, 3/4 lb. of suet, 3 or 4 eggs, milk,\r\n2 oz. of candied peel, 1 teaspoonful of powdered allspice, 1/2\r\nsaltspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the suet be finely chopped, the raisins stoned, and the\r\ncurrants well washed, picked, and dried. Mix these with the other dry\r\ningredients, and stir all well together; beat and strain the eggs to the\r\npudding, stir these in, and add just sufficient milk to make it mix\r\nproperly. Tie it up in a well-floured cloth, put it into boiling water,\r\nand boil for at least 5 hours. Serve with a sprig of holly placed in the\r\nmiddle of the pudding, and a little pounded sugar sprinkled over it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 9 or 10 children. _Seasonable_ at Christmas.\r\n\r\n    RAISINS.--Raisins are grapes, prepared by suffering them to\r\n    remain on the vine until they are perfectly ripe, and then\r\n    drying them in the sun or by the heat of an oven. The sun-dried\r\n    grapes are sweet, the oven-dried of an acid flavour. The common\r\n    way of drying grapes for raisins is to tie two or three bunches\r\n    of them together, whilst yet on the vine, and dip them into a\r\n    hot lixivium of wood-ashes mixed with a little of the oil of\r\n    olives: this disposes them to shrink and wrinkle, after which\r\n    they are left on the vine three or four days, separated, on\r\n    sticks in a horizontal situation, and then dried in the sun at\r\n    leisure, after being cut from the tree.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS PLUM-PUDDING.\r\n\r\n(_Very Good_.)\r\n\r\n1328. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of raisins, 1/2 lb. of currants, 1/2 lb.\r\nof mixed peel, 3/4 lb. of bread crumbs, 3/4 lb. of suet, 8 eggs, 1\r\nwineglassful of brandy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTMAS PLUM-PUDDING IN MOULD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Stone and cut the raisins in halves, but do not chop them;\r\nwash, pick, and dry the currants, and mince the suet finely; cut the\r\ncandied peel into thin slices, and grate down the bread into fine\r\ncrumbs. When all these dry ingredients are prepared, mix them well\r\ntogether; then moisten the mixture with the eggs, which should be well\r\nbeaten, and the brandy; stir well, that everything may be very\r\nthoroughly blended, and _press_ the pudding into a buttered mould; tie\r\nit down tightly with a floured cloth, and boil for 5 or 6 hours. It may\r\nbe boiled in a cloth without a mould, and will require the same time\r\nallowed for cooking. As Christmas puddings are usually made a few days\r\nbefore they are required for table, when the pudding is taken out of the\r\npot, hang it up immediately, and put a plate or saucer underneath to\r\ncatch the water that may drain from it. The day it is to be eaten,\r\nplunge it into boiling water, and keep it boiling for at least 2 hours;\r\nthen turn it out of the mould, and serve with brandy-sauce. On\r\nChristmas-day a sprig of holly is usually placed in the middle of the\r\npudding, and about a wineglassful of brandy poured round it, which, at\r\nthe moment of serving, is lighted, and the pudding thus brought to table\r\nencircled in flame.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 or 6 hours the first time of boiling; 2 hours the day it is\r\nto be served.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a quart mould for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ on the 25th of December, and on various festive occasions\r\ntill March.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Five or six of these puddings should be made at one time, as\r\nthey will keep good for many weeks, and in cases where unexpected guests\r\narrive, will be found an acceptable, and, as it only requires warming\r\nthrough, a quickly-prepared dish. Moulds of every shape and size are\r\nmanufactured for these puddings, and may be purchased of Messrs. R. & J.\r\nSlack, 336, Strand.\r\n\r\n    BRANDY is the alcoholic or spirituous portion of wine, separated\r\n    from the aqueous part, the colouring matter, &c., by\r\n    distillation. The word is of German origin, and in its German\r\n    form, _brantuein_, signifies burnt wine, or wine that has\r\n    undergone the action of fire; brandies, so called, however, have\r\n    been made from potatoes, carrots, beetroot, pears, and other\r\n    vegetable substances; but they are all inferior to true brandy.\r\n    Brandy is prepared in most wine countries, but that of France is\r\n    the most esteemed. It is procured not only by distilling the\r\n    wine itself, but also by fermenting and distilling the _marc_,\r\n    or residue of the pressings of the grape. It is procured\r\n    indifferently from red or white wine, and different wines yield\r\n    very different proportions of it, the strongest, of course,\r\n    giving the largest quantity. Brandy obtained from marc has a\r\n    more acrid taste than that from wine. The celebrated brandy of\r\n    Cognac, a town in the department of Charente, and that brought\r\n    from Andraye, seem to owe their excellence from being made from\r\n    white wine. Like other spirit, brandy is colourless when\r\n    recently distilled; by mere keeping, however, owing, probably,\r\n    to some change in the soluble matter contained in it, it\r\n    acquires a slight colour, which is much increased by keeping in\r\n    casks, and is made of the required intensity by the addition of\r\n    burnt sugar or other colouring matter. What is called _British\r\n    brandy_ is not, in fact, brandy, which is the name, as we have\r\n    said, of a spirit distilled from _wine;_ but is a spirit made\r\n    chiefly from malt spirit, with the addition of mineral acids and\r\n    various flavouring ingredients, the exact composition being kept\r\n    secret. It is distilled somewhat extensively in this country;\r\n    real brandy scarcely at all. The brandies imported into England\r\n    are chiefly from Bordeaux, Rochelle, and Cognac.\r\n\r\nA POUND PLUM-PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1329. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of suet, 1 lb. of currants, 1 lb. of stoned\r\nraisins, 8 eggs, 1/2 grated nutmeg, 2 oz. of sliced candied peel, 1\r\nteaspoonful of ground ginger, 1/2 lb. of bread crumbs, 1/2 lb. of flour,\r\n1/2 pint of milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAKED PUDDING OR CAKE-MOULD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the suet finely; mix with it the dry ingredients; stir\r\nthese well together, and add the well-beaten eggs and milk to moisten\r\nwith. Beat up the mixture well, and should the above proportion of milk\r\nnot be found sufficient to make it of the proper consistency, a little\r\nmore should be added. Press the pudding into a mould, tie it in a\r\nfloured cloth, and boil for 5 hours, or rather longer, and serve with\r\nbrandy-sauce.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 hours, or longer. _Average cost_, 3s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons. _Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The above pudding may be baked instead of boiled; it should be\r\nput into a buttered mould or tin, and baked for about 2 hours; a smaller\r\none would take about 1-1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n    CITRON.--The fruit of the citron-tree (_Citrus medica_) is\r\n    acidulous, antiseptic, and antiscorbutic: it excites the\r\n    appetite, and stops vomiting, and, like lemon-juice, has been\r\n    greatly extolled in chronic rheumatism, gout, and scurvy. Mixed\r\n    with cordials, it is used as an antidote to the _machineel\r\n    poison_. The candied peel is prepared in the same manner as\r\n    orange or lemon-peel; that is to say, the peel is boiled in\r\n    water until quite soft, and then suspended in concentrated syrup\r\n    (in the cold), after which it is either dried in a current of\r\n    warm air, or in a stove, at a heat not exceeding 120°\r\n    Fahrenheit. The syrup must be kept fully saturated with sugar by\r\n    reboiling it once or twice during the process. It may be dusted\r\n    with powdered lump sugar, if necessary. The citron is supposed\r\n    to be the Median, Assyrian, or Persian apple of the Greeks. It\r\n    is described by Risso as having a majestic appearance, its\r\n    shining leaves and rosy flowers being succeeded by fruit whose\r\n    beauty and size astonish the observer, whilst their odour\r\n    gratifies his senses. In China there is an enormous variety, but\r\n    the citron is cultivated in all orange-growing countries.\r\n\r\nPLUM-PUDDING OF FRESH FRUIT.\r\n\r\n1330. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of suet crust No. 1-1/2 pint of Orleans or\r\nany other kind of plum, 1/4 lb. of moist sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Line a pudding-basin with suet crust rolled out to the\r\nthickness of about 1/2 inch; fill the basin with the fruit, put in the\r\nsugar, and cover with crust. Fold the edges over, and pinch them\r\ntogether, to prevent the juice escaping. Tie over a floured cloth, put\r\nthe pudding into boiling water, and boil from 2 to 2-1/2 hours. Turn it\r\nout of the basin, and serve quickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 to 2-1/2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_, with various kinds of plums, from the beginning of August\r\nto the beginning of October.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLUM.]\r\n\r\n    PLUMS.--Almost all the varieties of the cultivated plum are\r\n    agreeable and refreshing: it is not a nourishing fruit, and if\r\n    indulged in to excess, when unripe, is almost certain to cause\r\n    diarrhoea and cholera. Weak and delicate persons had better\r\n    abstain from plums altogether. The modes of preparing plums are\r\n    as numerous as the varieties of the fruit. The objections raised\r\n    against raw plums do not apply to the cooked fruit, which even\r\n    the invalid may eat in moderation.\r\n\r\nPLUM TART.\r\n\r\n1331. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of good short crust No. 1211, 1-1/2 pint of\r\nplums, 1/4 lb. of moist sugar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLUM TART.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Line the edges of a deep tart-dish with crust made by recipe\r\nNo. 1211; fill the dish with plums, and place a small cup or jar, upside\r\ndown, in the midst of them. Put in the sugar, cover the pie with crust,\r\nornament the edges, and bake in a good oven from 1/2 to 3/4 hour. When\r\npuff-crust is preferred to short crust, use that made by recipe No.\r\n1206, and glaze the top by brushing it over with the white of an egg\r\nbeaten to a stiff froth with a knife; sprinkle over a little sifted\r\nsugar, and put the pie in the oven to set the glaze.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_, with various kinds of plums, from the beginning of August\r\nto the beginning of October.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO PASTY.\r\n\r\n1332. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of rump-steak or mutton cutlets, pepper\r\nand salt to taste, 1/3 pint of weak broth or gravy, 1 oz. of butter,\r\nmashed potatoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POTATO-PASTY PAN.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Place the meat, cut in small pieces, at the bottom of the pan;\r\nseason it with pepper and salt, and add the gravy and butter broken,\r\ninto small pieces. Put on the perforated plate, with its valve-pipe\r\nscrewed on, and fill up the whole space to the top of the tube with\r\nnicely-mashed potatoes mixed with a little milk, and finish the surface\r\nof them in any ornamental manner. If carefully baked, the potatoes will\r\nbe covered with a delicate brown crust, retaining all the savoury steam\r\nrising from the meat. Send it to table as it comes from the oven, with a\r\nnapkin folded round it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--40 to 60 minutes. _Average cost_, 2s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1333. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of mashed potatoes, 2 oz. of butter, 2 eggs,\r\n1/4 pint of milk, 3 tablespoonfuls of sherry, 1/4 saltspoonful of salt,\r\nthe juice and rind of 1 small lemon, 2 oz. of sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil sufficient potatoes to make 1/2 lb. when mashed; add to\r\nthese the butter, eggs, milk, sherry, lemon-juice, and sugar; mince the\r\nlemon-peel very finely, and beat all the ingredients well together. Put\r\nthe pudding into a buttered pie-dish, and bake for rather more than 1/2\r\nhour. To enrich it, add a few pounded almonds, and increase the quantity\r\nof eggs and butter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour, or rather longer. _Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ICE OR GLAZE PASTRY.\r\n\r\n1334. To glaze pastry, which is the usual method adopted for meat or\r\nraised pies, break an egg, separate the yolk from the white, and beat\r\nthe former for a short time. Then, when the pastry is nearly baked, take\r\nit out of the oven, brush it over with this beaten yolk of egg, and put\r\nit back in the oven to set the glaze.\r\n\r\n1335. To ice pastry, which is the usual method adopted for fruit tarts\r\nand sweet dishes of pastry, put the white of an egg on a plate, and with\r\nthe blade of a knife beat it to a stiff froth. When the pastry is nearly\r\nbaked, brush it over with this, and sift over some pounded sugar; put it\r\nback into the oven to set the glaze, and, in a few minutes, it will be\r\ndone. Great care should be taken that the paste does not catch or burn\r\nin the oven, which it is very liable to do after the icing is laid on.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_--Allow 1 egg and 1-1/8 oz. of sugar to glaze 3 tarts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGAR CANES.]\r\n\r\n    SUGAR has been happily called \"the honey of reeds.\" The\r\n    sugar-cane appears to be originally a native of the East Indies.\r\n    The Chinese have cultivated it for 2,000 years. The Egyptians,\r\n    Phoenicians, and Jews knew nothing about it. The Greek\r\n    physicians are the first who speak of it. It was not till the\r\n    year 1471 that a Venetian discovered the method of purifying\r\n    brown sugar and making loaf sugar. He gained an immense fortune\r\n    by this discovery. Our supplies are now obtained from Barbadoes,\r\n    Jamaica, Mauritius, Ceylon, the East and West Indies generally,\r\n    and the United States; but the largest supplies come from Cuba.\r\n    Sugar is divided into the following classes:--Refined sugar,\r\n    white clayed, brown clayed, brown raw, and molasses. The\r\n    sugarcane grows to the height of six, twelve, or even sometimes\r\n    twenty feet. It is propagated from cuttings, requires much\r\n    hoeing and weeding, giving employment to thousands upon\r\n    thousands of slaves in the slave countries, and attains maturity\r\n    in twelve or thirteen months. When ripe, it is cut down close to\r\n    the stole, the stems are divided into lengths of about three\r\n    feet, which are made up into bundles, and carried to the mill,\r\n    to be crushed between rollers. In the process of crushing, the\r\n    juice runs down into a reservoir, from which, after a while, it\r\n    is drawn through a siphon; that is to say, the clear fluid is\r\n    taken from the scum. This fluid undergoes several processes of\r\n    drying and refining; the methods varying in different\r\n    manufactories. There are some large establishments engaged in\r\n    sugar-refining in the neighbourhoods of Blackwall and Bethnal\r\n    Green, London. The process is mostly in the hands of German\r\n    workmen. Sugar is adulterated with fine sand and sawdust. Pure\r\n    sugar is highly nutritious, adding to the fatty tissue of the\r\n    body; but it is not easy of digestion.\r\n\r\nBAKED RAISIN PUDDING.\r\n\r\n(_Plain and Economical_.)\r\n\r\n1336. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 3/4 lb. of stoned raisins, 1/2 lb. of\r\nsuet, a pinch of salt, 1 oz. of sugar, a little grated nutmeg, milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the suet finely; stone the raisins and cut them in halves;\r\nmix these with the suet, add the salt, sugar, and grated nutmeg, and\r\nmoisten the whole with sufficient milk to make it of the consistency of\r\nthick batter. Put the pudding into a buttered pie-dish, and bake for\r\n1-1/2 hour, or rather longer. Turn it out of the dish, strew sifted\r\nsugar over, and serve. This is a very plain recipe, and suitable where\r\nthere is a family of children. It, of course, can be much improved by\r\nthe addition of candied peel, currants, and rather a larger proportion\r\nof suet: a few eggs would also make the pudding richer.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons. _Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n    INTRODUCTION OF SUGAR.--Sugar was first known as a drug, and\r\n    used by the apothecaries, and with them was a most important\r\n    article. At its first appearance, some said it was heating;\r\n    others, that it injured the chest; others, that it disposed\r\n    persons to apoplexy; the truth, however, soon conquered these\r\n    fancies, and the use of sugar has increased every day, and there\r\n    is no household in the civilized world which can do without it.\r\n\r\nBOILED RAISIN PUDDING.\r\n\r\n(_Plain and Economical_.)\r\n\r\n1337. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of stoned raisins, 1/2 lb.\r\nof chopped suet, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt, milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--After having stoned the raisins and chopped the suet finely,\r\nmix them with the flour, add the salt, and when these dry ingredients\r\nare thoroughly mixed, moisten the pudding with sufficient milk to make\r\nit into rather a stiff paste. Tie it up in a floured cloth, put it into\r\nboiling water, and boil for 4 hours: serve with sifted sugar. This\r\npudding may, also, be made in a long shape, the same as a rolled\r\njam-pudding, and will then not require so long boiling;--2-1/2 hours\r\nwould then be quite sufficient.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Made round, 4 hours; in a long shape, 2-1/2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 8 or 9 persons. _Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED RHUBARB PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1338. INGREDIENTS.--4 or 5 sticks of fine rhubarb, 1/4 lb. of moist\r\nsugar, 3/4 lb. of suet-crust No. 1215.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a suet-crust with 3/4 lb. of flour, by recipe No. 1215,\r\nand line a buttered basin with it. Wash and wipe the rhubarb, and, if\r\nold, string it--that is to say, pare off the outside skin. Cut it into\r\ninch lengths, fill the basin with it, put in the sugar, and cover with\r\ncrust. Pinch the edges of the pudding together, tie over it a floured\r\ncloth, put it into boiling water, and boil from 2 to 2-1/2 hours. Turn\r\nit out of the basin, and serve with a jug of cream and sifted sugar.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 to 2-1/2 hours. _Average cost_, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons. _Seasonable_ in spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHUBARB TART.\r\n\r\n1339. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of puff-paste No. 1206, about 5 sticks of\r\nlarge rhubarb, 1/4 lb. of moist sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a puff-crust by recipe No. 1206; line the edges of a deep\r\npie-dish with it, and wash, wipe, and cut the rhubarb into pieces about\r\n1 inch long. Should it be old and tough, string it, that is to say, pare\r\noff the outside skin. Pile the fruit high in the dish, as it shrinks\r\nvery much in the cooking; put in the sugar, cover with crust, ornament\r\nthe edges, and bake the tart in a well-heated oven from 1/2 to 3/4 hour.\r\nIf wanted very nice, brush it over with the white of an egg beaten to a\r\nstiff froth, then sprinkle on it some sifted sugar, and put it in the\r\noven just to set the glaze: this should be done when the tart is nearly\r\nbaked. A small quantity of lemon-juice, and a little of the peel minced,\r\nare by many persons considered an improvement to the flavour of rhubarb\r\ntart.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in spring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RHUBARB.]\r\n\r\n    RHUBARB.--This is one of the most useful of all garden\r\n    productions that are put into pies and puddings. It was\r\n    comparatively little known till within the last twenty or thirty\r\n    years, but it is now cultivated in almost every British garden.\r\n    The part used is the footstalks of the leaves, which, peeled and\r\n    cut into small pieces, are put into tarts, either mixed with\r\n    apples or alone. When quite young, they are much better not\r\n    peeled. Rhubarb comes in season when apples are going out. The\r\n    common rhubarb is a native of Asia; the scarlet variety has the\r\n    finest flavour. Turkey rhubarb, the well-known medicinal drug,\r\n    is the root of a very elegant plant (_Rheum palmatum_), coming\r\n    to greatest perfection in Tartary. For culinary purposes, all\r\n    kinds of rhubarb are the better for being blanched.\r\n\r\nRAISED PIE OF POULTRY OR GAME.\r\n\r\n1340. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 1/2 lb. of butter, 1/2\r\npint of water, the yolks of 2 eggs, 1/2 teaspoonful of salt (these are\r\nfor the crust); 1 large fowl or pheasant, a few slices of veal cutlet, a\r\nfew slices of dressed ham, forcemeat, seasoning of nutmeg, allspice,\r\npepper and salt, gravy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAISED PIE.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a stiff short crust with the above proportion of butter,\r\nflour, water, and eggs, and work it up very smoothly; butter a\r\nraised-pie mould, as shown in No. 1190, and line it with the paste.\r\nPreviously to making the crust, bone the fowl, or whatever bird is\r\nintended to be used, lay it, breast downwards, upon a cloth, and season\r\nthe inside well with pounded mace, allspice, pepper, and salt; then\r\nspread over it a layer of forcemeat, then a layer of seasoned veal, and\r\nthen one of ham, and then another layer of forcemeat, and roll the fowl\r\nover, making the skin meet at the back. Line the pie with forcemeat, put\r\nin the fowl, and fill up the cavities with slices of seasoned veal and\r\nham and forcemeat; wet the edges of the pie, put on the cover, pinch the\r\nedges together with the paste-pincers, and decorate it with leaves;\r\nbrush it over with beaten yolk of egg, and bake in a moderate oven for 4\r\nhours. In the mean time, make a good strong gravy from the bones, pour\r\nit through a funnel into the hole at the top; cover this hole with a\r\nsmall leaf, and the pie, when cold, will be ready for use. Let it be\r\nremembered that the gravy must be considerably reduced before it is\r\npoured into the pie, as, when cold, it should form a firm jelly, and not\r\nbe the least degree in a liquid state. This recipe is suitable for all\r\nkinds of poultry or game, using one or more birds, according to the size\r\nof the pie intended to be made; but the birds must always be boned.\r\nTruffles, mushrooms, &c., added to this pie, make it much nicer; and, to\r\nenrich it, lard the fleshy parts of the poultry or game with thin strips\r\nof bacon. This method of forming raised pies in a mould is generally\r\ncalled a _timbale_, and has the advantage of being more easily made than\r\none where the paste is raised by the hands; the crust, besides, being\r\neatable. (_See_ coloured plate N 1.) _Time_.--Large pie, 4 hours.\r\n_Average cost_, 6s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_, with poultry, all the year; with game, from September to\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISED PIE OF VEAL AND HAM.\r\n\r\n1341. INGREDIENTS.--3 or 4 lbs. of veal cutlets, a few slices of bacon\r\nor ham, seasoning of pepper, salt, nutmeg, and allspice, forcemeat No.\r\n415, 2 lbs. of hot-water paste No. 1217, 1/2 pint of good strong gravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--To raise the crust for a pie with the hands is a very difficult\r\ntask, and can only be accomplished by skilled and experienced cooks. The\r\nprocess should be seen to be satisfactorily learnt, and plenty of\r\npractice given to the making of raised pies, as by that means only will\r\nsuccess be insured. Make a hot-water paste by recipe No. 1217, and from\r\nthe mass raise the pie with the hands; if this cannot be accomplished,\r\ncut out pieces for the top and bottom, and a long piece for the sides;\r\nfasten the bottom and side-piece together by means of egg, and pinch the\r\nedges well together; then line the pie with forcemeat made by recipe No.\r\n415, put in a layer of veal, and a plentiful seasoning of salt, pepper,\r\nnutmeg, and allspice, as, let it be remembered, these pies taste very\r\ninsipid unless highly seasoned. Over the seasoning place a layer of\r\nsliced bacon or cooked ham, and then a layer of forcemeat, veal\r\nseasoning, and bacon, and so on until the meat rises to about an inch\r\nabove the paste; taking care to finish with a layer of forcemeat, to\r\nfill all the cavities of the pie, and to lay in the meat firmly and\r\ncompactly. Brush the top edge of the pie with beaten egg, put on the\r\ncover, press the edges, and pinch them round with paste-pincers. Make a\r\nhole in the middle of the lid, and ornament the pie with leaves, which\r\nshould be stuck on with the white of an egg; then brush it all over with\r\nthe beaten yolk of an egg, and bake the pie in an oven with a soaking\r\nheat from 3 to 4 hours. To ascertain when it is done, run a\r\nsharp-pointed knife or skewer through the hole at the top into the\r\nmiddle of the pie, and if the meat feels tender, it is sufficiently\r\nbaked. Have ready about 1/2 pint of very strong gravy, pour it through a\r\nfunnel into the hole at the top, stop up the hole with a small leaf of\r\nbaked paste, and put the pie away until wanted for use. Should it\r\nacquire too much colour in the baking, cover it with white paper, as the\r\ncrust should not in the least degree be burnt. Mushrooms, truffles, and\r\nmany other ingredients, may be added to enrich the flavour of these\r\npies, and the very fleshy parts of the meat may be larded. These pies\r\nare more frequently served cold than hot, and form excellent dishes for\r\ncold suppers or breakfasts. The cover of the pie is sometimes carefully\r\nremoved, leaving the perfect edges, and the top decorated with square\r\npieces of very bright aspic jelly: this has an exceedingly pretty\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 4 hours. _Average cost_, 6s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a very large pie. _Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED RICE PUDDING.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n1342. INGREDIENTS.--1 small teacupful of rice, 4 eggs, 1 pint of milk, 2\r\noz. of fresh butter, 2 oz. of beef marrow, 1/4 lb. of currants, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of brandy, nutmeg, 1/4 lb. of sugar, the rind of 1/2\r\nlemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the lemon-rind and milk into a stewpan, and let it infuse\r\ntill the milk is well flavoured with the lemon; in the mean time, boil\r\nthe rice until tender in water, with a very small quantity of salt, and,\r\nwhen done, let it be thoroughly drained. Beat the eggs, stir to them the\r\nmilk, which should be strained, the butter, marrow, currants, and\r\nremaining ingredients; add the rice, and mix all well together. Line the\r\nedges of the dish with puff-paste, put in the pudding, and bake for\r\nabout 3/4 hour in a slow oven. Slices of candied-peel may be added at\r\npleasure, or Sultana raisins may be substituted for the currants.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Suitable for a winter pudding, when fresh fruits are not\r\nobtainable.\r\n\r\n    RICE, with proper management in cooking it, forms a very\r\n    valuable and cheap addition to our farinaceous food, and, in\r\n    years of scarcity, has been found eminently useful in lessening\r\n    the consumption of flour. When boiled, it should be so managed\r\n    that the grains, though soft, should be as little broken and as\r\n    dry as possible. The water in which it is dressed should only\r\n    simmer, and not boil hard. Very little water should be used, as\r\n    the grains absorb a great deal, and, consequently, swell much;\r\n    and if they take up too much at first, it is difficult to get\r\n    rid of it. Baking it in puddings is the best mode of preparing\r\n    it.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n(_Plain and Economical; a nice Pudding for Children_.)\r\n\r\n1343. INGREDIENTS.--1 teacupful of rice, 2 tablespoonfuls of moist\r\nsugar, 1 quart of milk, 1/2 oz. of butter or 2 small tablespoonfuls of\r\nchopped suet, 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the rice, put it into a pie-dish with the sugar, pour in\r\nthe milk, and stir these ingredients well together; then add the butter\r\ncut up into very small pieces, or, instead of this, the above proportion\r\nof finely-minced suet; grate a little nutmeg over the top, and bake the\r\npudding, in a moderate oven, from 1-1/2 to 2 hours. As the rice is not\r\npreviously cooked, care must be taken that the pudding be very slowly\r\nbaked, to give plenty of time for the rice to swell, and for it to be\r\nvery thoroughly done.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 to 2 hours. _Average cost_, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 children. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\nPLAIN BOILED RICE PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1344. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of rice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the rice, tie it in a pudding-cloth, allowing room for the\r\nrice to swell, and put it into a saucepan of cold water; boil it gently\r\nfor 2 hours, and if, after a time, the cloth seems tied too loosely,\r\ntake the rice up and tighten the cloth. Serve with sweet melted butter,\r\nor cold butter and sugar, or stewed fruit, jam, or marmalade; any of\r\nwhich accompaniments are suitable for plain boiled rice.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours after the water boils. _Average cost_, 2d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\nBOILED RICE PUDDING.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n1345. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of rice, 1-1/2 pint of new milk, 2 oz. of\r\nbutter, 4 eggs, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt, 4 large tablespoonfuls of\r\nmoist sugar, flavouring to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Stew the rice very gently in the above proportion of new milk,\r\nand, when it is tender, pour it into a basin; stir in the butter, and\r\nlet it stand to cool; then beat the eggs, add these to the rice with the\r\nsugar, salt, and any flavouring that may be approved, such as nutmeg,\r\npowdered cinnamon, grated lemon-peel, essence of bitter almonds, or\r\nvanilla. When all is well stirred, put the pudding into a buttered\r\nbasin, tie it down with a cloth, plunge it into boiling water, and boil\r\nfor 1-1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/4 hour. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    VARIETIES OF RICE.--Of the varieties of rice brought to our\r\n    market, that from Bengal is chiefly of the species denominated\r\n    _cargo_ rice, and is of a coarse reddish-brown cast, but\r\n    peculiarly sweet and large-grained; it does not readily separate\r\n    from the husk, but it is preferred by the natives to all the\r\n    others. _Patua_ rice is more esteemed in Europe, and is of very\r\n    superior qualify; it is small-grained, rather long and wiry, and\r\n    is remarkably white. The _Carolina_ rice is considered as the\r\n    best, and is likewise the dearest in London.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n(_With Dried or Fresh fruit; a nice dish for the Nursery_.)\r\n\r\n1346. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of rice, 1 pint of any kind of fresh fruit\r\nthat may be preferred, or 1/2 lb. of raisins or currants.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the rice, tie it in a cloth, allowing room for it to\r\nswell, and put it into a saucepan of cold water; let it boil for an\r\nhour, then take it up, untie the cloth, stir in the fruit, and tie it up\r\nagain tolerably tight, and put it into the water for the remainder of\r\nthe time. Boil for another hour, or rather longer, and serve with sweet\r\nsauce, if made with dried fruit, and with plain sifted sugar and a\r\nlittle cream or milk, if made with fresh fruit.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour to boil the rice without the fruit; 1 hour, or longer,\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 children. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\nNote.--This pudding is very good made with apples: they should be pared\r\ncored, and cut into thin slices.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED RICE FOR CURRIES, &c.\r\n\r\n1347. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of rice, water, salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick, wash, and soak the rice in plenty of cold water; then\r\nhave ready a saucepan of boiling water, drop the rice into it, and keep\r\nit boiling quickly, with the lid uncovered, until it is tender, but not\r\nsoft. Take it up, drain it, and put it on a dish before the fire to dry:\r\ndo not handle it much with a spoon, but shake it about a little with two\r\nforks, that it may all be equally dried, and strew over a little salt.\r\nIt is now ready to serve, and may be heaped lightly on a dish by itself,\r\nor be laid round the dish as a border, with a curry or fricassee in the\r\ncentre. Some cooks smooth the rice with the back of a spoon, and then\r\nbrush it over with the yolk of an egg, and set it in the oven to colour;\r\nbut the rice well boiled, white, dry, and with every grain distinct, is\r\nby far the more preferable mode of dressing it. During the process of\r\nboiling, the rice should be attentively watched, that it be not\r\noverdone, as, if this is the case, it will have a mashed and soft\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 to 25 minutes, according to the quality of the rice.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a large dish of curry.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    RICE, in the native rough state, with the husk on, is called\r\n    _paddy_, both in India and America, and it will keep better, and\r\n    for a much longer time, in this state, than after the husk has\r\n    been removed; besides which, prepared rice is apt to become\r\n    dirty from rubbing about in the voyage on board ship, and in the\r\n    warehouses. It is sometimes brought to England in the shape of\r\n    paddy, and the husk detached here. Paddy pays less duty than\r\n    shelled rice.\r\n\r\nTO BOIL RICE FOR CURRIES, &c.\r\n\r\n(_Soyer's Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n1348. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of the best Carolina rice, 2 quarts of water,\r\n1-1/2 oz. of butter, a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the rice well in two waters; make 2 quarts of water\r\nboiling, and throw the rice into it; boil it until three-parts done,\r\nthen drain it on a sieve. Butter the bottom and sides of a stewpan, put\r\nin the rice, place the lid on tightly, and set it by the side of the\r\nfire until the rice is perfectly tender, occasionally shaking the pan to\r\nprevent its sticking. Prepared thus, every grain should be separate and\r\nwhite. Either dish it separately, or place it round the curry as a\r\nborder.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 to 25 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 moderate-sized curries.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERED RICE.\r\n\r\n1349. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of rice, 1-1/2 pint of milk, 2 oz. of\r\nbutter, sugar to taste, grated nutmeg or pounded cinnamon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash and pick the rice, drain and put it into a saucepan with\r\nthe milk; let it swell gradually, and, when tender, pour off the milk;\r\nstir in the butter, sugar, and nutmeg or cinnamon, and, when the butter\r\nis thoroughly melted, and the whole is quite hot, serve. After the milk\r\nis poured off, be particular that the rice does not burn: to prevent\r\nthis, do not cease stirring it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3/4 hour to swell the rice.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE was held in great esteem by the ancients: they considered it as a\r\nvery beneficial food for the chest; therefore it was recommended in\r\ncases of consumption, and to persons subject to spitting of blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVOURY CASSEROLE OF RICE.\r\n\r\nOr Rice Border, for Ragouts, Fricassees, &c. (an Entree).\r\n\r\n1350. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of rice, 3 pints of weak stock or broth, 2\r\nslices of fat ham, 1 teaspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASSEROLE OF RICE.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--A casserole of rice, when made in a mould, is not such a\r\ndifficult operation as when it is moulded by the hand. It is an elegant\r\nand inexpensive entrée, as the remains of cold fish, flesh, or fowl may\r\nbe served as ragoûts, fricassees, &c., inclosed in the casserole. It\r\nrequires great nicety in its preparation, the principal thing to attend\r\nto being the boiling of the rice, as, if this is not sufficiently\r\ncooked, the casserole, when moulded, will have a rough appearance, which\r\nwould entirely spoil it. After having washed the rice in two or three\r\nwaters, drain it well, and put it into a stewpan with the stock, ham,\r\nand salt; cover the pan closely, and let the rice gradually swell over a\r\nslow fire, occasionally stirring, to prevent its sticking. When it is\r\nquite soft, strain it, pick out the pieces of ham, and, with the back of\r\na large wooden spoon, mash the rice to a perfectly smooth paste. Then\r\nwell grease a mould (moulds are made purposely for rice borders), and\r\nturn it upside down for a minute or two, to drain away the fat, should\r\nthere be too much; put some rice all round the bottom and sides of it;\r\nplace a piece of soft bread in the middle, and cover it with rice; press\r\nit in equally with the spoon, and let it cool. Then dip the mould into\r\nhot water, turn the casserole carefully on to a dish, mark where the lid\r\nis to be formed on the top, by making an incision with the point of a\r\nknife about an inch from the edge all round, and put it into a _very\r\nhot_ oven. Brush it over with a little clarified butter, and bake about\r\n1/2 hour, or rather longer; then carefully remove the lid, which will be\r\nformed by the incision having been made all round, and remove the bread,\r\nin small pieces, with the point of a penknife, being careful not to\r\ninjure the casserole. Fill the centre with the ragoût or fricassee,\r\nwhich should be made thick; put on the cover, glaze it, place it in the\r\noven to set the glaze, and serve as hot as possible. The casserole\r\nshould not be emptied too much, as it is liable to crack from the weight\r\nof whatever is put in; and in baking it, let the oven be very hot, or\r\nthe casserole will probably break.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3/4 hour to swell the rice.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 moderate-sized casseroles.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CASSEROLE OF RICE (an Entremets).\r\n\r\n1351. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of rice, 3 pints of milk, sugar to taste,\r\nflavouring of bitter almonds, 3 oz. of butter, the yolks of 3 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--This is made in precisely the same manner as a savoury\r\ncasserole, only substituting the milk and sugar for the stock and salt.\r\nPut the milk into a stewpan, with sufficient essence of bitter almonds\r\nto flavour it well; then add the rice, which should be washed, picked,\r\nand drained, and let it swell gradually in the milk over a slow fire.\r\nWhen it is tender, stir in the sugar, butter, and yolks of eggs; butter\r\na mould, press in the rice, and proceed in exactly the same manner as in\r\nrecipe No. 1350. When the casserole is ready, fill it with a compôte of\r\nany fruit that may be preferred, or with melted apricot-jam, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 3/4 to 1 hour to swell the rice, 1/2 to 3/4 hour to bake\r\nthe casserole.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the compôte or jam, 1s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 casseroles.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH RICE PUDDING, or GATEAU DE RIZ.\r\n\r\n1352. INGREDIENTS.--To every 1/4 lb. of rice allow 1 quart of milk, the\r\nrind of 1 lemon, 1/2 teaspoonful of salt, sugar to taste, 4 oz. of\r\nbutter, 6 eggs, bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk into a stewpan with the lemon-rind, and let it\r\ninfuse for 1/2 hour, or until the former is well flavoured; then take\r\nout the peel; have ready the rice washed, picked, and drained; put it\r\ninto the milk, and let it gradually swell over a very slow fire. Stir in\r\nthe butter, salt, and sugar, and when properly sweetened, add the yolks\r\nof the eggs, and then the whites, both of which should be well beaten,\r\nand added separately to the rice. Butter a mould, strew in some fine\r\nbread crumbs, and let them be spread equally over it; then carefully\r\npour in the rice, and bake the pudding in a _slow_ oven for 1 hour. Turn\r\nit out of the mould, and garnish the dish with preserved cherries, or\r\nany bright-coloured jelly or jam. This pudding would be exceedingly\r\nnice, flavoured with essence of vanilla.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 to 1 hour for the rice to swell; to be baked 1 hour in a\r\nslow oven.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED OR BOILED GROUND RICE PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1353. INGREDIENTS.--2 pints of milk, 6 tablespoonfuls of ground rice,\r\nsugar to taste, 4 eggs, flavouring of lemon-rind, nutmeg, bitter almonds\r\nor bay-leaf.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put 1-1/2 pint of the milk into a stewpan, with any of the\r\nabove flavourings, and bring it to the boiling-point, and, with the\r\nother 1/2 pint of milk, mix the ground rice to a smooth batter; strain\r\nthe boiling milk to this, and stir over the fire until the mixture is\r\ntolerably thick; then pour it into a basin, leave it uncovered, and when\r\nnearly or quite cold, sweeten it to taste, and add the eggs, which\r\nshould be previously well beaten, with a little salt. Put the pudding\r\ninto a well-buttered basin, tie it down with a cloth, plunge it into\r\nboiling water, and boil for 1-1/2 hour. For a baked pudding, proceed in\r\nprecisely the same manner, only using half the above proportion of\r\nground rice, with the same quantity of all the other ingredients: an\r\nhour will bake the pudding in a moderate oven. Stewed fruit, or\r\npreserves, or marmalade, may be served with either the boiled or baked\r\npudding, and will be found an improvement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour to boil, 1 hour to bake. _Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nICED RICE PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1354. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of rice, 1 quart of milk, 1/2 lb. of sugar,\r\nthe yolks of 6 eggs, 1 small teaspoonful of essence of vanilla.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the rice into a stewpan, with the milk and sugar, and let\r\nthese simmer over a gentle fire until the rice is sufficiently soft to\r\nbreak up into a smooth mass, and should the milk dry away too much, a\r\nlittle more may be added. Stir the rice occasionally, to prevent its\r\nburning, then beat it to a smooth mixture; add the yolks of the eggs,\r\nwhich should be well whisked, and the vanilla (should this flavouring\r\nnot be liked, essence of bitter almonds may be substituted for it); put\r\nthis rice custard into the freezing-pot, and proceed as directed in\r\nrecipe No. 1290. When wanted for table, turn the pudding out of the\r\nmould, and pour over the top, and round it, a _compôte_ of oranges, or\r\nany other fruit that may be preferred, taking care that the flavouring\r\nin the pudding harmonizes well with the fruit that is served with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to freeze the mixture.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.; exclusive of the _compôte_, 1s. 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Served all the year round.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINIATURE RICE PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n1355. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of rice, 1-1/2 pint of milk, 2 oz. of fresh\r\nbutter, 4 eggs, sugar to taste; flavouring of lemon-peel, bitter\r\nalmonds, or vanilla; a few strips of candied peel.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the rice swell in 1 pint of the milk over a slow fire,\r\nputting with it a strip of lemon-peel; stir to it the butter and the\r\nother 1/2 pint of milk, and let the mixture cool. Then add the\r\nwell-beaten eggs, and a few drops of essence of almonds or essence of\r\nvanilla, whichever may be preferred; butter well some small cups or\r\nmoulds, line them with a few pieces of candied peel sliced very thin,\r\nfill them three parts full, and bake for about 40 minutes; turn them out\r\nof the cups on to a white d'oyley, and serve with sweet sauce. The\r\nflavouring and candied peel might be omitted, and stewed fruit or\r\npreserve served instead, with these puddings.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--40 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 puddings. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nARROWROOT SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n1356. INGREDIENTS.--2 small teaspoonfuls of arrowroot, 4\r\ndessert-spoonfuls of pounded sugar, the juice of 1 lemon, 1/4\r\nteaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1/2 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the arrowroot smoothly with the water; put this into a\r\nstewpan; add the sugar, strained lemon-juice, and grated nutmeg. Stir\r\nthese ingredients over the fire until they boil, when the sauce is ready\r\nfor use. A small quantity of wine, or any liqueur, would very much\r\nimprove the flavour of this sauce: it is usually served with bread,\r\nrice, custard, or any dry pudding that is not very rich.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRY SAUCE FOR SWEET PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n(_German Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n1357. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of cherries, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 oz.\r\nof butter, 1/2 pint of water, 1 wineglassful of port wine, a little\r\ngrated lemon-rind, 4 pounded cloves, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice,\r\nsugar to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Stone the cherries, and pound the kernels in a mortar to a\r\nsmooth paste; put the butter and flour into a saucepan; stir them over\r\nthe fire until of a pale brown; then add the cherries, the pounded\r\nkernels, the wine, and the water. Simmer these gently for 1/4 hour, or\r\nuntil the cherries are quite cooked, and rub the whole through a hair\r\nsieve; add the remaining ingredients, let the sauce boil for another 5\r\nminutes, and serve. This is a delicious sauce to serve with boiled\r\nbatter pudding, and when thus used, should be sent to table poured over\r\nthe pudding.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 1d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ in June, July, and August.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON SAUCE FOR SWEET PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n1358. INGREDIENTS.--The rind and juice of 1 lemon, 1 tablespoonful of\r\nflour, 1 oz. of butter, 1 large wineglassful of sherry, 1 wineglassful\r\nof water, sugar to taste, the yolks of 4 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the rind of the lemon on to some lumps of sugar; squeeze\r\nout the juice, and strain it; put the butter and flour into a saucepan,\r\nstir them over the fire, and when of a pale brown, add the wine, water,\r\nand strained lemon-juice. Crush the lumps of sugar that were rubbed on\r\nthe lemon; stir these into the sauce, which should be very sweet. When\r\nthese ingredients are well mixed, and the sugar is melted, put in the\r\nbeaten yolks of 4 eggs; keep stirring the sauce until it thickens, when\r\nserve. Do not, on any account, allow it to boil, or it will curdle, and\r\nbe entirely spoiled.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 15 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOYER'S SAUCE FOR PLUM-PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1359. INGREDIENTS.--The yolks of 3 eggs, 1 tablespoonful of powdered\r\nsugar, 1 gill of milk, a very little grated lemon-rind, 2 small\r\nwineglassfuls of brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Separate the yolks from the whites of 3 eggs, and put the\r\nformer into a stewpan; add the sugar, milk, and grated lemon-rind, and\r\nstir over the fire until the mixture thickens; but do _not_ allow it to\r\n_boil_. Put in the brandy; let the sauce stand by the side of the fire,\r\nto get quite hot; keep stirring it, and serve in a boat or tureen\r\nseparately, or pour it over the pudding.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 10 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n1360.

Previously to making the melted butter,\r\nthe milk can be flavoured with bitter almonds, by infusing about half a\r\ndozen of them in it for about 1/2 hour; the milk should then be strained\r\nbefore it is added to the other ingredients. This simple sauce may be\r\nserved for children with rice, batter, or bread pudding.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 15 minutes. _Average cost_, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANILLA CUSTARD SAUCE, to serve with Puddings.\r\n\r\n1361.

Put the mixture into a small jug, place this jug\r\nin a saucepan of boiling water, and stir the sauce _one way_ until it\r\nthickens; but do not allow it to boil, or it will instantly curdle.\r\nServe in a boat or tureen separately, with plum, bread, or any kind of\r\ndry pudding. Essence of bitter almonds or lemon-rind may be substituted\r\nfor the vanilla, when they are more in accordance with the flavouring of\r\nthe pudding with which the sauce is intended to be served.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To be stirred in the jug from 8 to 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXCELLENT WINE SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n1362.

Serve in a boat or tureen\r\nseparately, and, if liked, pour a little of it over the pudding. To\r\nconvert this into punch sauce, add to the sherry and brandy a small\r\nwineglassful of rum and the juice and grated rind of 1/2 lemon.\r\nLiqueurs, such as Maraschino or Curaçoa substituted for the brandy, make\r\nexcellent sauces.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 15 minutes. _Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINE SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n1364.

INGREDIENTS.--Trimmings of puff-paste, any kind of jam.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Butter a tart-pan of the shape shown in the engraving, roll out\r\nthe paste to the thickness of 1/2 an inch, and line the pan with it;\r\nprick a few holes at the bottom with a fork, and bake the tart in a\r\nbrisk oven from 10 to 15 minutes. Let the paste cool a little; then fill\r\nit with preserve, place a few stars or leaves on it, which have been\r\npreviously cut out of the paste and baked, and the tart is ready for\r\ntable. By making it in this manner, both the flavour and colour of the\r\njam are preserved, which would otherwise be lost, were it baked in the\r\noven on the paste; and, besides, so much jam is not required.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes. _Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--1 tart for 3 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRY.--The name of this favourite fruit is said to be derived from\r\nan ancient custom of putting straw beneath the fruit when it began to\r\nripen, which is very useful to keep it moist and clean. The strawberry\r\nbelongs to temperate and rather cold climates; and no fruit of these\r\nlatitudes, that ripens without the aid of artificial heat, is at all\r\ncomparable with it in point of flavour. The strawberry is widely\r\ndiffused, being found in most parts of the world, particularly in Europe\r\nand America.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUICKLY-MADE PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n1366. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of butter, 1/2 lb. of sifted sugar, 1/4 lb.\r\nof flour, 1 pint of milk, 5 eggs, a little grated lemon-rind.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the milk hot; stir in the butter, and let it cool before\r\nthe other ingredients are added to it; then stir in the sugar, flour,\r\nand eggs, which should be well whisked, and omit the whites of 2;\r\nflavour with a little grated lemon-rind, and beat the mixture well.\r\nButter some small cups, rather more than half fill them; bake from 20\r\nminutes to 1/2 hour, according to the size of the puddings, and serve\r\nwith fruit, custard, or wine sauce, a little of which may be poured over\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 puddings. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAGO PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1367. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of milk, 3 tablespoonfuls of sago, the\r\nrind of 1/2 lemon, 3 oz. of sugar, 4 eggs, 1-1/2 oz. of butter, grated\r\nnutmeg, puff-paste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk and lemon-rind into a stewpan, place it by the\r\nside of the fire, and let it remain until the milk is well flavoured\r\nwith the lemon; then strain it, mix with it the sago and sugar, and\r\nsimmer gently for about 15 minutes. Let the mixture cool a little, and\r\nstir to it the eggs, which should be well beaten, and the butter. Line\r\nthe edges of a pie-dish with puff-paste, pour in the pudding, grate a\r\nlittle nutmeg over the top, and bake from 3/4 to 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 to 1 hour, or longer if the oven is very slow.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The above pudding may be boiled instead of baked; but then\r\nallow 2 extra tablespoonfuls of sago, and boil the pudding in a buttered\r\nbasin from 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n    SAGO.--Sago is the pith of a species of palm (_Cycas\r\n    circinalis_). Its form is that of a small round grain. There are\r\n    two sorts of sago,--the white and the yellow; but their\r\n    properties are the same. Sago absorbs the liquid in which it is\r\n    cooked, becomes transparent and soft, and retains its original\r\n    shape. Its alimentary properties are the same as those of\r\n    tapioca and arrowroot.\r\n\r\nSAGO SAUCE FOR SWEET PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n1368. INGREDIENTS.--1 tablespoonful of sago, 1/3 pint of water, 1/4 pint\r\nof port or sherry, the rind and juice of 1 small lemon, sugar to taste;\r\nwhen the flavour is liked, a little pounded cinnamon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the sago in two or three waters; then put it into a\r\nsaucepan, with the water and lemon-peel; let it simmer gently by the\r\nside of the fire for 10 minutes; then take out the lemon-peel, add the\r\nremaining ingredients, give one boil, and serve. Be particular to strain\r\nthe lemon-juice before adding it to the sauce. This, on trial, will be\r\nfound a delicious accompaniment to various boiled puddings, such as\r\nthose made of bread, raisins, rice, &c.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes. _Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED SEMOLINA PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1369. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of semolina, 1-1/2 pint of milk, 1/4 lb. of\r\nsugar, 12 bitter almonds, 3 oz. of butter, 4 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Flavour the milk with the bitter almonds, by infusing them in\r\nit by the side of the fire for about 1/2 hour; then strain it, and mix\r\nwith it the semolina, sugar, and butter. Stir these ingredients over the\r\nfire for a few minutes; then take them off, and gradually mix in the\r\neggs, which should be well beaten. Butter a pie-dish, line the edges\r\nwith puff-paste, put in the pudding, and bake in rather a slow oven from\r\n40 to 50 minutes. Serve with custard sauce or stewed fruit, a little of\r\nwhich may be poured over the pudding.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--40 to 50 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    SEMOLINA.--After vermicelli, semolina is the most useful\r\n    ingredient that can be used for thickening soups, meat or\r\n    vegetable, of rich or simple quality. Semolina is softening,\r\n    light, wholesome, easy of digestion, and adapted to the infant,\r\n    the aged, and the invalid. That of a clear yellow colour, well\r\n    dried and newly made, is the fittest for use.\r\n\r\nTAPIOCA PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1370. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of tapioca, 1 quart of milk, 2 oz. of butter,\r\n1/4 lb. of sugar, 4 eggs, flavouring of vanilla, grated lemon-rind, or\r\nbitter almonds.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the tapioca, and let it stew gently in the milk by the\r\nside of the fire for 1/4 hour, occasionally stirring it; then let it\r\ncool a little; mix with it the butter, sugar, and eggs, which should be\r\nwell beaten, and flavour with either of the above ingredients, putting\r\nin about 12 drops of the essence of almonds or vanilla, whichever is\r\npreferred. Butter a pie-dish, and line the edges with puff-paste; put in\r\nthe pudding, and bake in a moderate oven for an hour. If the pudding is\r\nboiled, add a little more tapioca, and boil it in a buttered basin 1-1/2\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour to bake, 1-1/2 hour to boil.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    TAPIOCA.--Tapioca is recommended to the convalescent, as being\r\n    easy of digestion. It may be used in soup or broth, or mixed\r\n    with milk or water, and butter. It is excellent food for either\r\n    the healthy or sick, for the reason that it is so quickly\r\n    digested without fatigue to the stomach.\r\n\r\nTARTLETS.\r\n\r\n1371. INGREDIENTS.--Trimmings of puff-paste, any jam or marmalade that\r\nmay be preferred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISH OF TARTLETS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Roll out the paste to the thickness of about 1/2 inch; butter\r\nsome small round patty-pans, line them with it, and cut off the\r\nsuperfluous paste close to the edge of the pan. Put a small piece of\r\nbread into each tartlet (this is to keep them in shape), and bake in a\r\nbrisk oven for about 10 minutes, or rather longer. When they are done,\r\nand are of a nice colour, take the pieces of bread out carefully, and\r\nreplace them by a spoonful of jam or marmalade. Dish them high on a\r\nwhite d'oyley, piled high in the centre, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes. _Average cost_, 1d. each. _Sufficient_.--1\r\nlb. of paste will make 2 dishes of tartlets. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nROLLED TREACLE PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1372. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of suet crust No. 1215, 1 lb. of treacle, 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of grated ginger.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make, with 1 lb. of flour, a suet crust by recipe No. 1215;\r\nroll it out to the thickness of 1/2 inch, and spread the treacle equally\r\nover it, leaving a small margin where the paste joins; close the ends\r\nsecurely, tie the pudding in a floured cloth, plunge it into boiling\r\nwater, and boil for 2 hours. We have inserted this pudding, being\r\neconomical, and a favourite one with children; it is, of course, only\r\nsuitable for a nursery, or very plain family dinner. Made with a lard\r\ninstead of a suet crust, it would be very nice baked, and would be\r\nsufficiently done in from 1-1/2 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Boiled pudding, 2 hours; baked pudding, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAT OR SAUSAGE ROLLS.\r\n\r\n1373. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of puff-paste No. 1206, sausage-meat No. 837,\r\nthe yolk of 1 egg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make 1 lb. of puff-paste by recipe No. 1206; roll it out to the\r\nthickness of about 1/2 inch, or rather less, and divide it into 8, 10,\r\nor 12 squares, according to the size the rolls are intended to be. Place\r\nsome sausage-meat on one-half of each square, wet the edges of the\r\npaste, and fold it over the meat; slightly press the edges together, and\r\ntrim them neatly with a knife. Brush the rolls over with the yolk of an\r\negg, and bake them in a well-heated oven for about 1/2 hour, or longer\r\nshould they be very large. The remains of cold chicken and ham, minced\r\nand seasoned, as also cold veal or beef, make very good rolls.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour, or longer if the rolls are large.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--1 lb. of paste for 10 or 12 rolls.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_, with sausage-meat, from September to March or April.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMERSETSHIRE PUDDINGS.\r\n\r\n1374. INGREDIENTS.--3 eggs, their weight in flour, pounded sugar and\r\nbutter, flavouring of grated lemon-rind, bitter almonds, or essence of\r\nvanilla.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Carefully weigh the various ingredients, by placing on one side\r\nof the scales the eggs, and on the other the flour; then the sugar, and\r\nthen the butter. Warm the butter, and with the hands beat it to a cream;\r\ngradually dredge in the flour and pounded sugar, and keep stirring and\r\nbeating the mixture without ceasing until it is perfectly smooth. Then\r\nadd the eggs, which should be well whisked, and either of the above\r\nflavourings that may be preferred; butter some small cups, rather more\r\nthan half-fill them, and bake in a brisk oven for about 1/2 hour. Turn\r\nthem out, dish them on a napkin, and serve custard or wine-sauce with\r\nthem. A pretty little supper-dish may be made of these puddings cold, by\r\ncutting out a portion of the inside with the point of a knife, and\r\nputting into the cavity a little whipped cream or delicate preserve,\r\nsuch as apricot, greengage, or very bright marmalade. The paste for\r\nthese puddings requires a great deal of mixing, as the more it is\r\nbeaten, the better will the puddings be. When served cold, they are\r\nusually called _gâteaux à la Madeleine_.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 puddings. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUET PUDDING, to serve with Roast Meat.\r\n\r\n1375. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 6 oz. of finely-chopped suet, 1/2\r\nsaltspoonful of salt, 1/2 saltspoonful of pepper, 1/2 pint of milk or\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Chop the suet very finely, after freeing it from skin, and mix\r\nit well with the flour; add the salt and pepper (this latter ingredient\r\nmay be omitted if the flavour is not liked), and make the whole into a\r\nsmooth paste with the above proportion of milk or water. Tie the pudding\r\nin a floured cloth, or put it into a buttered basin, and boil from 2-1/2\r\nto 3 hours. To enrich it, substitute 3 beaten eggs for some of the milk\r\nor water, and increase the proportion of suet.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 to 3 hours. _Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--When there is a joint roasting or baking, this pudding may be\r\nboiled in a long shape, and then cut into slices a few minutes before\r\ndinner is served: these slices should be laid in the dripping-pan for a\r\nminute or two, and then browned before the fire. Most children like this\r\naccompaniment to roast meat. Where there is a large family of children,\r\nand the means of keeping them are limited, it is a most economical plan\r\nto serve up the pudding before the meat: as, in this case, the\r\nconsumption of the latter article will be much smaller than it otherwise\r\nwould be.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSSEX, or HARD DUMPLINGS.\r\n\r\n1376. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 1/2 pint of water, 1/2 saltspoonful\r\nof salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the flour and water together to a smooth paste, previously\r\nadding a small quantity of salt. Form this into small round dumplings;\r\ndrop them into boiling water, and boil from 1/2 to 3/4 hour. They may be\r\nserved with roast or boiled meat; in the latter case they may be cooked\r\nwith the meat, but should be dropped into the water when it is quite\r\nboiling.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 10 or 12 dumplings. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERMICELLI PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1377. INGREDIENTS.--4 oz. of vermicelli, 1-1/2 pint of milk, 1/2 pint of\r\ncream, 3 oz. of butter, 3 oz. of sugar, 4 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the vermicelli in the milk until it is tender; then stir\r\nin the remaining ingredients, omitting the cream, if not obtainable.\r\nFlavour the mixture with grated lemon-rind, essence of bitter almonds,\r\nor vanilla; butter a pie-dish; line the edges with puff-paste, put in\r\nthe pudding, and bake in a moderate oven for about 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 2d. without cream.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERMICELLI.--The finest vermicelli comes from Marseilles, Nimes, and\r\nMontpellier. It is a nourishing food, and owes its name to its peculiar\r\nthread-like form. Vermicelli means, little worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nVICARAGE PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1378. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of flour, 1/4 lb. of chopped suet, 1/4 lb.\r\nof currants, 1/4 lb. of raisins, 1 tablespoonful of moist sugar, 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of ground ginger, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a basin, having previously stoned\r\nthe raisins, and washed, picked, and dried the currants; mix well with a\r\nclean knife; dip the pudding-cloth into boiling water, wring it out, and\r\nput in the mixture. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, plunge in\r\nthe pudding, and boil for 3 hours. Turn it out on the dish, and serve\r\nwith sifted sugar.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Suitable for a winter pudding.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOL-AU-VENT (an Entree).\r\n\r\n1379. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 to 1 lb. of puff-paste No. 1208, fricasseed\r\nchickens, rabbits, ragouts, or the remains of cold fish, flaked and\r\nwarmed in thick white sauce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VOL-AU-VENT.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make from 3/4 to 1 lb. of puff-paste, by recipe No. 1208,\r\ntaking care that it is very evenly rolled out each time, to insure its\r\nrising properly; and if the paste is not extremely light, and put into a\r\ngood hot oven, this cannot be accomplished, and the _vol-au-vent_ will\r\nlook very badly. Roll out the paste to the thickness of about 1-1/2\r\ninch, and, with a fluted cutter, stamp it out to the desired shape,\r\neither round or oval, and, with the point of a small knife, make a\r\nslight incision in the paste all round the top, about an inch from the\r\nedge, which, when baked, forms the lid. Put the _vol-au-vent_ into a\r\ngood brisk oven, and keep the door shut for a few minutes after it is\r\nput in. Particular attention should he paid to the heating of the oven,\r\nfor the paste _cannot_ rise without a tolerable degree of heat When of a\r\nnice colour, without being scorched, withdraw it from the oven,\r\ninstantly remove the cover where it was marked, and detach all the soft\r\ncrumb from the centre: in doing this, be careful not to break the edges\r\nof the _vol-au-vent_; but should they look thin in places, stop them\r\nwith small flakes of the inside paste, stuck on with the white of an\r\negg. This precaution is necessary to prevent the fricassee or ragoût\r\nfrom bursting the case, and so spoiling the appearance of the dish. Fill\r\nthe _vol-au-vent_ with a rich mince, or fricassee, or ragoût, or the\r\nremains of cold fish flaked and warmed in a good white sauce, and do not\r\nmake them very liquid, for fear of the gravy bursting the crust: replace\r\nthe lid, and serve. To improve the appearance of the crust, brush it\r\nover with the yolk of an egg after it has risen properly.--See coloured\r\nplate O1.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour to bake the _vol-au-vent_.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of interior, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMALL VOL-AU-VENTS.]\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Small _vol-au-vents_ may be made like those shown in the\r\nengraving, and filled with minced veal, chicken, &c. They should be made\r\nof the same paste as the larger ones, and stamped out with a small\r\nfluted cutter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET VOL-AU-VENT OF PLUMS, APPLES, OR ANY OTHER FRESH FRUIT.\r\n\r\n1380. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of puff-paste No. 1208, about 1 pint of\r\nfruit compôte.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make 1/2 lb. of puff-paste by recipe No. 1208, taking care to\r\nbake it in a good brisk oven, to draw it up nicely and make it look\r\nlight. Have ready sufficient stewed fruit, the syrup of which must be\r\nboiled down until very thick; fill the _vol-au-vent_ with this, and pile\r\nit high in the centre; powder a little sugar over it, and put it back in\r\nthe oven to glaze, or use a salamander for the purpose: the\r\n_vol-au-vent_ is then ready to serve. They may be made with any fruit\r\nthat is in season, such as rhubarb, oranges, gooseberries, currants,\r\ncherries, apples, &c.; but care must be taken not to have the syrup too\r\nthin, for fear of its breaking through the crust.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to 40 minutes to bake the _vol-au-vent_.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the compôte, 1s. 1d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 entremets.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOL-AU-VENT OF FRESH STRAWBERRIES WITH WHIPPED CREAM.\r\n\r\n1381. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of puff-paste No. 1208, 1 pint of\r\nfreshly-gathered strawberries, sugar to taste, a plateful of whipped\r\ncream.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a _vol-au-vent_ case by recipe No. 1379, only not quite so\r\nlarge nor so high as for a savoury one. When nearly done, brush the\r\npaste over with the white of an egg, then sprinkle on it some pounded\r\nsugar, and put it back in the oven to set the glaze. Remove the\r\ninterior, or soft crumb, and, at the moment of serving, fill it with the\r\nstrawberries, which should be picked, and broken up with sufficient\r\nsugar to sweeten them nicely. Place a few spoonfuls of whipped cream on\r\nthe top, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to 40 minutes to bake the _vol-au-vent_.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 _vol-au-vent_.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in June and July.\r\n\r\n    STRAWBERRY.--Among the Greeks, the name of the strawberry\r\n    indicated its tenuity, this fruit forming hardly a mouthful.\r\n    With the Latins, the name reminded one of the delicious perfume\r\n    of this plant. Both nations were equally fond of it, and applied\r\n    the same care to its cultivation. Virgil appears to place it in\r\n    the same rank with flowers; and Ovid gives it a tender epithet,\r\n    which delicate palates would not disavow. Neither does this\r\n    luxurious poet forget the wild strawberry, which disappears\r\n    beneath its modest foliage, but whose presence the scented air\r\n    reveals.\r\n\r\nWEST-INDIAN PUDDING.\r\n\r\n1382. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of cream, 1/2 lb. of loaf-sugar, 1/2 lb. of\r\nSavoy or sponge-cakes, 8 eggs, 3 oz. of preserved green ginger.\r\n_Mode_.--Crumble down the cakes, put them into a basin, and pour over\r\nthem the cream, which should be previously sweetened and brought to the\r\nboiling-point; cover the basin, well beat the eggs, and when the cream\r\nis soaked up, stir them in. Butter a mould, arrange the ginger round it,\r\npour in the pudding carefully, and tie it down with a cloth; steam or\r\nboil it slowly for 1-1/2 hour, and serve with the syrup from the ginger,\r\nwhich should be warmed, and poured over the pudding.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, with cream at 1s. per pint, 2s. 8d.\r\n\r\nSufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nYEAST DUMPLINGS.\r\n\r\n1383. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 quartern of dough, boiling water.\r\n\r\nMode.--Make a very light dough as for bread, using to mix it, milk,\r\ninstead of water; divide it into 7 or 8 dumplings; plunge them into\r\nboiling water, and boil them for 20 minutes. Serve the instant they are\r\ntaken up, as they spoil directly, by falling and becoming heavy; and in\r\neating them do not touch them with a knife, but tear them apart with two\r\nforks. They may be eaten with meat gravy, or cold butter and sugar, and\r\nif not convenient to make the dough at home, a little from the baker's\r\nanswers as well, only it must be placed for a few minutes near the fire,\r\nin a basin with a cloth over it, to let it rise again before it is made\r\ninto dumplings.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes. _Average cost_, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    YEAST consists principally of a substance very similar in\r\n    composition, and in many of its sensible properties, to gluten;\r\n    and, when new or fresh, it is inflated and rendered frothy by a\r\n    large quantity of carbonic acid. When mixed with wort, this\r\n    substance acts upon the saccharine matter; the temperature\r\n    rises, carbonic acid is disengaged, and the result is _ale_,\r\n    which always contains a considerable proportion of alcohol, or\r\n    spirit. The quantity of yeast employed in brewing ale being\r\n    small, the saccharine matter is but imperfectly decomposed:\r\n    hence a considerable portion of it remains in the liquor, and\r\n    gives it that viscid quality and body for which it is\r\n    remarkable. The fermenting property of yeast is weakened by\r\n    boiling for ten minutes, and is entirely destroyed by continuing\r\n    the boiling. Alcohol poured upon it likewise renders it inert;\r\n    on which account its power lessens as the alcohol is formed\r\n    during fermentation.\r\n\r\nYORKSHIRE PUDDING, to serve with hot Roast Beef.\r\n\r\n\r\n1384. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of milk, 6 _large_ tablespoonfuls of\r\nflour, 3 eggs, 1 saltspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YORKSHIRE PUDDING.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the flour into a basin with the salt, and stir gradually to\r\nthis enough milk to make it into a stiff batter. When this is perfectly\r\nsmooth, and all the lumps are well rubbed down, add the remainder of the\r\nmilk and the eggs, which should be well beaten. Beat the mixture for a\r\nfew minutes, and pour it into a shallow tin, which has been previously\r\nwell rubbed with beef dripping. Put the pudding into the oven, and bake\r\nit for an hour; then, for another 1/2 hour, place it under the meat, to\r\ncatch a little of the gravy that flows from it. Cut the pudding into\r\nsmall square pieces, put them on a hot dish, and serve. If the meat is\r\nbaked, the pudding may at once be placed under it, resting the former on\r\na small three-cornered stand.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON CREAMS, JELLIES, SOUFFLÉS, OMELETS, & SWEET\r\nDISHES.\r\n\r\n1385. CREAMS.--The yellowish-white, opaque fluid, smooth and unctuous to\r\nthe touch, which separates itself from new milk, and forms a layer on\r\nits surface, when removed by skimming, is employed in a variety of\r\nculinary preparations. The analyses of the contents of cream have been\r\ndecided to be, in 100 parts--butter, 3.5; curd, or matter of cheese,\r\n3.5; whey, 92.0. That cream contains an oil, is evinced by its staining\r\nclothes in the manner of oil; and when boiled for some time, a little\r\noil floats upon the surface. The thick animal oil which it contains, the\r\nwell-known _butter_, is separated only by agitation, as in the common\r\nprocess of _churning_, and the cheesy matter remains blended with the\r\nwhey in the state of _buttermilk_. Of the several kinds of cream, the\r\nprincipal are the Devonshire and Dutch clotted creams, the Costorphin\r\ncream, and the Scotch sour cream. The Devonshire cream is produced by\r\nnearly boiling the milk in shallow tin vessels over a charcoal fire, and\r\nkept in that state until the whole of the cream is thrown up. It is used\r\nfor eating with fruits and tarts. The cream from Costorphin, a village\r\nof that name near Edinburgh, is accelerated in its separation from three\r\nor four days' old milk, by a certain degree of heat; and the Dutch\r\nclotted cream--a coagulated mass in which a spoon will stand upright--is\r\nmanufactured from fresh-drawn milk, which is put into a pan, and stirred\r\nwith a spoon two or three times a day, to prevent the cream from\r\nseparating from the milk. The Scotch \"sour cream\" is a misnomer; for it\r\nis a material produced without cream. A small tub filled with skimmed\r\nmilk is put into a larger one, containing hot water, and after remaining\r\nthere all night, the thin milk (called _wigg_) is drawn off, and the\r\nremainder of the contents of the smaller vessel is \"sour cream.\"\r\n\r\n1386. JELLIES are not the nourishing food they were at one time\r\nconsidered to be, and many eminent physicians are of opinion that they\r\nare less digestible than the flesh, or muscular part of animals; still,\r\nwhen acidulated with lemon-juice and flavoured with wine, they are very\r\nsuitable for some convalescents. Vegetable jelly is a distinct\r\nprinciple, existing in fruits, which possesses the property of\r\ngelatinizing when boiled and cooled; but it is a principle entirely\r\ndifferent from the gelatine of animal bodies, although the name of\r\njelly, common to both, sometimes leads to an erroneous idea on that\r\nsubject. Animal jelly, or gelatine, is glue, whereas vegetable jelly is\r\nrather analogous to gum. Liebig places gelatine very low indeed in the\r\nscale of usefulness. He says, \"Gelatine, which by itself is tasteless,\r\nand when eaten, excites nausea, possesses no nutritive value; that, even\r\nwhen accompanied by the savoury constituents of flesh, it is not capable\r\nof supporting the vital process, and when added to the usual diet as a\r\nsubstitute for plastic matter, does not increase, but, on the contrary,\r\ndiminishes the nutritive value of the food, which it renders\r\ninsufficient in quantity and inferior in quality.\" It is this substance\r\nwhich is most frequently employed in the manufacture of the jellies\r\nsupplied by the confectioner; but those prepared at home from calves'\r\nfeet do possess some nutrition, and are the only sort that should be\r\ngiven to invalids. Isinglass is the purest variety of gelatine, and is\r\nprepared from the sounds or swimming-bladders of certain fish, chiefly\r\nthe sturgeon. From its whiteness it is mostly used for making\r\nblanc-mange and similar dishes.\r\n\r\n1387. THE WHITE OF EGGS is perhaps the best substance that can be\r\nemployed in clarifying jelly, as well as some other fluids, for the\r\nreason that when albumen (and the white of eggs is nearly pure albumen)\r\nis put into a liquid that is muddy, from substances suspended in it, on\r\nboiling the liquid, the albumen coagulates in a flocculent manner, and,\r\nentangling with it the impurities, rises with them to the surface as a\r\nscum, or sinks to the bottom, according to their weight.\r\n\r\n1388. SOUFFLES, OMELETS, AND SWEET DISHES, in which eggs form the\r\nprincipal ingredient, demand, for their successful manufacture, an\r\nexperienced cook. They are the prettiest, but most difficult of all\r\nentremets. The most essential thing to insure success is to secure the\r\nbest ingredients from an honest tradesman. The entremets coming within\r\nthe above classification, are healthy, nourishing, and pleasant to the\r\ntaste, and may be eaten with safety by persons of the most delicate\r\nstomachs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED APPLE CUSTARD.\r\n\r\n1389. INGREDIENTS.--1 dozen large apples, moist sugar to taste, 1 small\r\nteacupful of cold water, the grated rind of one lemon, 1 pint of milk, 4\r\neggs, 2 oz. of loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel, cut, and core the apples; put them into a lined saucepan\r\nwith the cold water, and as they heat, bruise them to a pulp; sweeten\r\nwith moist sugar, and add the grated lemon-rind. When cold, put the\r\nfruit at the bottom of a pie-dish, and pour over it a custard, made with\r\nthe above proportion of milk, eggs, and sugar; grate a little nutmeg\r\nover the top, place the dish in a moderate oven, and bake from 25 to 35\r\nminutes. The above proportions will make rather a large dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--25 to 35 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERED APPLES (Sweet Entremets).\r\n\r\n1390. INGREDIENTS.--Apple marmalade No. 1395, 6 or 7 good boiling\r\napples, 1/2 pint of water, 6 oz. of sugar, 2 oz. of butter, a little\r\napricot jam.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare the apples, and take out the cores without dividing them;\r\nboil up the sugar and water for a few minutes; then lay in the apples,\r\nand simmer them very gently until tender, taking care not to let them\r\nbreak. Have ready sufficient marmalade made by recipe No. 1395, and\r\nflavoured with lemon, to cover the bottom of the dish; arrange the\r\napples on this with a piece of butter placed in each, and in between\r\nthem a few spoonfuls of apricot jam or marmalade; place the dish in the\r\noven for 10 minutes, then sprinkle over the top sifted sugar; either\r\nbrown it before the fire or with a salamander, and serve hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 20 to 30 minutes to stew the apples very gently, 10\r\nminutes in the oven.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 entremets.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The syrup that the apples were boiled in should be saved for\r\nanother occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANC OF APPLES, or APPLES IN A RAISED CRUST.\r\n\r\n_(Sweet Entremets.)_\r\n\r\n1391. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of short crust No. 1211 or 1212, 9\r\nmoderate-sized apples, the rind and juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/2 lb. of white\r\nsugar, 3/4 pint of water, a few strips of candied citron.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a short crust by either of the above recipes; roll it out\r\nto the thickness of 1/2 inch, and butter an oval mould; line it with the\r\ncrust, and press it carefully all round the sides, to obtain the form of\r\nthe mould, but be particular not to break the paste. Pinch the part that\r\njust rises above the mould with the paste-pincers, and fill the case\r\nwith flour; bake it for about 3/4 hour; then take it out of the oven,\r\nremove the flour, put the case back in the oven for another 1/4 hour,\r\nand do not allow it to get scorched. It is now ready for the apples,\r\nwhich should be prepared in the following manner: peel, and take out the\r\ncores with a small knife, or a cutter for the purpose, without dividing\r\nthe apples; put them into a small lined saucepan, just capable of\r\nholding them, with sugar, water, lemon juice and rind, in the above\r\nproportion. Let them simmer very gently until tender; then take out the\r\napples, let them cool, arrange them in the flanc or case, and boil down\r\nthe syrup until reduced to a thick jelly; pour it over the apples, and\r\ngarnish them with a few slices of candied citron.\r\n\r\n1392. A MORE SIMPLE FLANC may be made by rolling out the paste, cutting\r\nthe bottom of a round or oval shape, and then a narrow strip for the\r\nsides: these should be stuck on with the white of an egg, to the bottom\r\npiece, and the flanc then filled with raw fruit, with sufficient sugar\r\nto sweeten it nicely. It will not require so long baking as in a mould;\r\nbut the crust must be made everywhere of an equal thickness, and so\r\nperfectly joined, that the juice does not escape. This dish may also be\r\nserved hot, and should be garnished in the same manner, or a little\r\nmelted apricot jam may be poured over the apples, which very much\r\nimproves their flavour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1 hour to bake the flanc from 30 to 40 minutes to\r\nstew the apples very gently.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 entremets or side-dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE FRITTERS.\r\n\r\n1393. INGREDIENTS.--For the batter, 1/2 lb. of flour, 1/2 oz. of butter,\r\n1/2 saltspoonful of salt, 2 eggs, milk, apples, hot lard or clarified\r\nbeef-dripping.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Break the eggs; separate the whites from the yolks, and beat\r\nthem separately. Put the flour into a basin, stir in the butter, which\r\nshould be melted to a cream; add the salt, and moisten with sufficient\r\nwarm milk to make it of a proper consistency, that is to say, a batter\r\nthat will drop from the spoon. Stir this well, rub down any lumps that\r\nmay be seen, and add the whites of the eggs, which have been previously\r\nwell whisked; beat up the batter for a few minutes, and it is ready for\r\nuse. Now peel and cut the apples into rather thick whole slices, without\r\ndividing them, and stamp out the middle of each slice, where the core\r\nis, with a cutter. Throw the slices into the batter; have ready a pan of\r\nboiling lard or clarified dripping; take out the pieces of apple one by\r\none, put them into the hot lard, and fry a nice brown, turning\r\nthem--when required. When done, lay them on a piece of blotting-paper\r\nbefore the fire, to absorb the greasy moisture; then dish on a white\r\nd'oyley, piled one above the other; strew over them some pounded sugar,\r\nand serve very hot. The flavour of the fritters would be very much\r\nimproved by soaking the pieces of apple in a little wine, mixed with\r\nsugar and lemon-juice, for 3 or 4 hours before wanted for table; the\r\nbatter, also, is better for being mixed some hours before the fritters\r\nare made.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 10 minutes to fry them; 5 minutes to drain them.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nICED APPLES, or APPLE HEDGEHOG.\r\n\r\n1394. INGREDIENTS.--About 3 dozen good boiling apples, 1/2 lb. of sugar,\r\n1/2 pint of water, the rind of 1/2 lemon minced very fine, the whites of\r\n2 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls of pounded sugar, a few sweet almonds.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel and core a dozen of the apples without dividing them, and\r\nstew them very gently in a lined saucepan with 1/2 lb. of sugar and 1/2\r\npint of water, and when tender, lift them carefully on to a dish. Have\r\nready the remainder of the apples pared, cored, and cut into thin\r\nslices; put them into the same syrup with the lemon-peel, and boil\r\ngently until they are reduced to a marmalade: they must be kept stirred,\r\nto prevent them from burning. Cover the bottom of a dish with some of\r\nthe marmalade, and over that a layer of the stewed apples, in the\r\ninsides of which, and between each, place some of the marmalade; then\r\nplace another layer of apples, and fill up the cavities with marmalade\r\nas before, forming the whole into a raised oval shape. Whip the whites\r\nof the eggs to a stiff froth, mix with them the pounded sugar, and cover\r\nthe apples very smoothly all over with the icing; blanch and cut each\r\nalmond into 4 or 5 strips; place these strips at equal distances over\r\nthe icing sticking up; strew over a little rough pounded sugar, and\r\nplace the dish in a very slow oven, to colour the almonds, and for the\r\napples to get warm through. This entremets may also be served cold, and\r\nmakes a pretty supper-dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 20 to 30 minutes to stew the apples.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 9d. to 2s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHICK APPLE JELLY OR MARMALADE, for Entremets or Dessert Dishes.\r\n\r\n1395. INGREDIENTS.--Apples; to every lb. of pulp allow 3/4 lb. of sugar,\r\n1/2 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPLE JELLY STUCK WITH ALMONDS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel, core, and boil the apples with only sufficient water to\r\nprevent them from burning; beat them to a pulp, and to every lb. of pulp\r\nallow the above proportion of sugar in lumps. Dip the lumps into water;\r\nput these into a saucepan, and boil till the syrup is thick and can be\r\nwell skimmed; then add this syrup to the apple pulp, with the minced\r\nlemon-peel, and stir it over a quick fire for about 20 minutes, or until\r\nthe apples cease to stick to the bottom of the pan. The jelly is then\r\ndone, and may be poured into moulds which have been previously dipped in\r\nwater, when it will turn out nicely for dessert or a side-dish; for the\r\nlatter a little custard should be poured round, and it should be\r\ngarnished with strips of citron or stuck with blanched almonds.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 1/2 to 3/4 hour to reduce the apples to a pulp; 20 minutes\r\nto boil after the sugar is added.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient._--1-1/2 lb. of apples sufficient for a small mould.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to March; but is best in September, October or\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEAR APPLE JELLY.\r\n\r\n1396. INGREDIENTS.--2 dozen apples, 1-1/2 pint of spring-water; to every\r\npint of juice allow 1/2 lb. of loaf sugar, 1/2 oz. of isinglass, the\r\nrind of 1/2 lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare, core, and cut the apples into quarters, and boil them,\r\nwith the lemon-peel, until tender; then strain off the apples, and run\r\nthe juice through a jelly-bag; put the strained juice, with the sugar\r\nand isinglass, which has been previously boiled in 1/2 pint of water,\r\ninto a lined saucepan or preserving-pan; boil all together for about 1/4\r\nhour, and put the jelly into moulds. When this jelly is nice and clear,\r\nand turned out well, it makes a pretty addition to the supper-table,\r\nwith a little custard or whipped cream round it: the addition of a\r\nlittle lemon-juice improves the flavour, but it is apt to render the\r\njelly muddy and thick. If required to be kept any length of time, rather\r\na larger proportion of sugar must be used.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 1 to 1-1/2 hour to boil the apples; 1/4 hour the jelly.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a 1-1/2-pint mould.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRETTY DISH OF APPLES AND RICE.\r\n\r\n1397. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of rice, 1 quart of milk, the rind of 1/2\r\nlemon, sugar to taste, 1/2 saltspoonful of salt, 8 apples, 1/4 lb. of\r\nsugar, 1/4 pint of water, 1/2 pint of boiled custard No. 1423.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Flavour the milk with lemon-rind, by boiling them together for\r\na few minutes; then take out the peel, and put in the rice, with\r\nsufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely, and boil gently until the rice is\r\nquite soft; then let it cool. In the mean time pare, quarter, and core\r\nthe apples, and boil them until tender in a syrup made with sugar and\r\nwater in the above proportion; and, when soft, lift them out on a sieve\r\nto drain. Now put a middling-sized gallipot in the centre of a dish; lay\r\nthe rice all round till the top of the gallipot is reached; smooth the\r\nrice with the back of a spoon, and stick the apples into it in rows, one\r\nrow sloping to the right and the next to the left. Set it in the oven to\r\ncolour the apples; then, when required for table, remove the gallipot,\r\ngarnish the rice with preserved fruits, and pour in the middle\r\nsufficient custard, made by recipe No. 1423, to be level with the top of\r\nthe rice, and serve hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 20 to 30 minutes to stew the apples; 3/4 hour to simmer\r\nthe rice; 1/4 hour to bake.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLES A LA PORTUGAISE.\r\n\r\n1398. INGREDIENTS.--8 good boiling apples, 1/2 pint of water, 6 oz. of\r\nsugar, a layer of apple marmalade No. 1395, 8 preserved cherries,\r\ngarnishing of apricot jam.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the apples, and, with a vegetable-cutter, push out the\r\ncores; boil them in the above proportion of sugar and water, without\r\nbeing too much done, and take care they do not break. Have ready a white\r\napple marmalade, made by recipe No. 1395; cover the bottom of the dish\r\nwith this, level it, and lay the apples in a sieve to drain, pile them\r\nneatly on the marmalade, making them high in the centre, and place a\r\npreserved cherry in the middle of each. Garnish with strips of candied\r\ncitron or apricot jam, and the dish is ready for table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 20 to SO minutes to stew the apples.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 entremets.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLES IN RED JELLY.\r\n\r\n(_A pretty Supper Dish_.)\r\n\r\n1399. INGREDIENTS.--6 good-sized apples, 12 cloves, pounded sugar, 1\r\nlemon, 2 teacupfuls of water, 1 tablespoonful of gelatine, a few drops\r\nof prepared cochineal.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose rather large apples; peel them and take out the cores,\r\neither with a scoop or a small silver knife, and put into each apple 2\r\ncloves and as much sifted sugar as they will hold. Place them, without\r\ntouching each other, in a large pie-dish; add more white sugar, the\r\njuice of 1 lemon, and 2 teacupfuls of water. Bake in the oven, with a\r\ndish over them, until they are done. Look at them frequently, and, as\r\neach apple is cooked, place it in a glass dish. They must not be left in\r\nthe oven after they are done, or they will break, and so would spoil the\r\nappearance of the dish. When the apples are neatly arranged in the dish\r\nwithout touching each other, strain the liquor in which they have been\r\nstewing, into a lined saucepan; add to it the rind of the lemon, and a\r\ntablespoonful of gelatine which has been previously dissolved in cold\r\nwater, and, if not sweet, a little more sugar, and 6 cloves. Boil till\r\nquite clear; colour with a few drops of prepared cochineal, and strain\r\nthe jelly through a double muslin into a jug; let it cool _a little_;\r\nthen pour it into the dish round the apples. When quite cold, garnish\r\nthe tops of the apples with a bright-coloured marmalade, a jelly, or the\r\nwhite of an egg, beaten to a strong froth, with a little sifted sugar.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 30 to 50 minutes to bake the apples.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s., with the garnishing.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLES AND RICE.\r\n\r\n_(A Plain Dish.)_\r\n\r\n1400. INGREDIENTS.--8 good sized apples, 3 oz. of butter, the rind of\r\n1/2 lemon minced very fine, 6 oz. of rice, 1-1/2 pint of milk, sugar to\r\ntaste, 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 6 tablespoonfuls of apricot\r\njam.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the apples, halve them, and take out the cores; put them\r\ninto a stewpan with the butter, and strew sufficient sifted sugar over\r\nto sweeten them nicely, and add the minced lemon-peel. Stew the apples\r\nvery gently until tender, taking care they do not break. Boil the rice,\r\nwith the milk, sugar, and nutmeg, until soft, and, when thoroughly done,\r\ndish it, piled high in the centre; arrange the apples on it, warm the\r\napricot jam, pour it over the whole, and serve hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 30 minutes to stew the apples very gently; about 3/4 hour\r\nto cook the rice.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE SNOW.\r\n\r\n(_A pretty Supper Dish_.)\r\n\r\n1401. INGREDIENTS.--10 good-sized apples, the whites of 10 eggs, the\r\nrind of 1 lemon, 1/2 lb. of pounded sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel, core, and cut the apples into quarters, and put them into\r\na saucepan with the lemon-peel and sufficient water to prevent them from\r\nburning,--rather less than 1/2 pint. When they are tender, take out the\r\npeel, beat them to a pulp, let them cool, and stir them to the whites of\r\nthe eggs, which should be previously beaten to a strong froth. Add the\r\nsifted sugar, and continue the whisking until the mixture becomes quite\r\nstiff; and either heap it on a glass dish, or serve it in small glasses.\r\nThe dish may be garnished with preserved barberries, or strips of\r\nbright-coloured jelly; and a dish of custards should be served with it,\r\nor a jug of cream.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 30 to 40 minutes to stew the apples.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a moderate-sized glass dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE SOUFFLE.\r\n\r\n1402. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of rice, 1 quart of milk, the rind of 1/2\r\nlemon, sugar to taste, the yolks of 4 eggs, the whites of 6, 1-1/2 oz.\r\nof butter, 4 tablespoonfuls of apple marmalade No. 1395.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the milk with the lemon-peel until the former is well\r\nflavoured; then strain it, put in the rice, and let it gradually swell\r\nover a slow fire, adding sufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely. Then\r\ncrush the rice to a smooth pulp with the back of a wooden spoon; line\r\nthe bottom and sides of a round cake-tin with it, and put it into the\r\noven to set; turn it out of the tin carefully, and be careful that the\r\nborder of rice is firm in every part. Mix with the marmalade the beaten\r\nyolks of eggs and the butter, and stir these over the fire until the\r\nmixture thickens. Take it off the fire; to this add the whites of the\r\neggs, which should be previously beaten to a strong froth; stir all\r\ntogether, and put it into the rice border. Bake in a moderate oven for\r\nabout 1/2 hour, or until the soufflé rises very light. It should be\r\nwatched, and served instantly, or it will immediately fall after it is\r\ntaken from the oven.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED APPLES AND CUSTARD.\r\n\r\n(_A pretty Dish for a Juvenile Supper_.)\r\n\r\n1403. INGREDIENTS.--7 good-sized apples, the rind of 1/2 lemon or 4\r\ncloves, 1/2 lb. of sugar, 3/4 pint of water, 1/2 pint of custard No.\r\n1423.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare and take out the cores of the apples, without dividing\r\nthem, and, if possible, leave the stalks on; boil the sugar and water\r\ntogether for 10 minutes; then put in the apples with the lemon-rind or\r\ncloves, whichever flavour may be preferred, and simmer gently until they\r\nare tender, taking care not to let them break. Dish them neatly on a\r\nglass dish, reduce the syrup by boiling it quickly for a few minutes,\r\nlet it cool a little; then pour it over the apples. Have ready quite 1/2\r\npint of custard made by recipe No. 1423; pour it round, but not over,\r\nthe apples when they are quite cold, and the dish is ready for table. A\r\nfew almonds blanched and cut into strips, and stuck in the apples, would\r\nimprove their appearance.--See coloured plate Q1.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 20 to 30 minutes to stew the apples.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a large glass dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE TRIFLE.\r\n\r\n(_A Supper Dish_.)\r\n\r\n1404. INGREDIENTS.--10 good-sized apples, the rind of 1/2 lemon, 6 oz.\r\nof pounded sugar, 1/2 pint of milk, 1/2 pint of cream, 2 eggs, whipped\r\ncream.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel, core, and cut the apples into thin slices, and put them\r\ninto a saucepan with 2 tablespoonfuls of water, the sugar, and minced\r\nlemon-rind. Boil all together until quite tender, and pulp the apples\r\nthrough a sieve; if they should not be quite sweet enough, add a little\r\nmore sugar, and put them at the bottom of the dish to form a thick\r\nlayer. Stir together the milk, cream, and eggs, with a little sugar,\r\nover the fire, and let the mixture thicken, but do not allow it to reach\r\nthe boiling-point. When thick, take it off the fire; let it cool a\r\nlittle, then pour it over the apples. Whip some cream with sugar,\r\nlemon-peel, &c., the same as for other trifles; heap it high over the\r\ncustard, and the dish is ready for table. It may be garnished as fancy\r\ndictates, with strips of bright apple jelly, slices of citron, &c.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 30 to 40 minutes to stew the apples; 10 minutes to stir\r\nthe custard over the fire.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a moderate-sized trifle.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRICOT CREAM.\r\n\r\n1405. INGREDIENTS.--12 to 16 ripe apricots, 1/4 lb. of sugar, 1-1/2 pint\r\nof milk, the yolks of 8 eggs, 1 oz. of isinglass.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Divide the apricots, take out the stones, and boil them in a\r\nsyrup made with 1/4 lb. of sugar and 1/4 pint of water, until they form\r\na thin marmalade, which rub through a sieve. Boil the milk with the\r\nother 1/4 lb. of sugar, let it cool a little, then mix with it the yolks\r\nof eggs which have been previously well beaten; put this mixture into a\r\njug, place this jug in boiling water, and stir it one way over the fire\r\nuntil it thickens; but on no account let it boil. Strain through a\r\nsieve, add the isinglass, previously boiled with a small quantity of\r\nwater, and keep stirring it till nearly cold; then mix the cream with\r\nthe apricots; stir well, put it into an oiled mould, and, if convenient,\r\nset it on ice; at any rate, in a very cool place. It should turn out on\r\nthe dish without any difficulty.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 20 to 30 minutes to boil the apricots.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a quart mould.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in August, September, and October.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--In winter-time, when fresh apricots are not obtainable, a\r\nlittle jam may be substituted for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLANC OF APRICOTS, or Compote of Apricots in a Raised Crust.\r\n\r\n_(Sweet Entremets.)_\r\n\r\n1406. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 lb. of short crust No. 1212, from 9 to 12\r\ngood-sized apricots, 3/4 pint of water, 1/2 lb. of sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a short crust by recipe No. 1212, and line a mould with it\r\nas directed in recipe No. 1391. Boil the sugar and water together for 10\r\nminutes; halve the apricots, take out the stones, and simmer them in the\r\nsyrup until tender; watch them carefully, and take them up the moment\r\nthey are done, for fear they break. Arrange them neatly in the flanc or\r\ncase; boil the syrup until reduced to a jelly, pour it over the fruit,\r\nand serve either hot or cold. Greengages, plums of all kinds, peaches,\r\n&c., may be done in the same manner, as also currants, raspberries,\r\ngooseberries, strawberries, &c.; but with the last-named fruits, a\r\nlittle currant-juice added to them will be found an improvement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1 hour to bake the flanc, about 10 minutes to\r\nsimmer the apricots.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 entremets or side-dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July, August, and September.\r\n\r\n\r\nARROWROOT BLANC-MANGE.\r\n\r\n(_An inexpensive Supper Dish_.)\r\n\r\n1407. INGREDIENTS.--4 heaped tablespoonfuls of arrowroot, 1-1/2 pint of\r\nmilk, 3 laurel-leaves or the rind of 1/2 lemon, sugar to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix to a smooth batter the arrowroot with 1/2 pint of the milk;\r\nput the other pint on the fire, with laurel-leaves or lemon-peel,\r\nwhichever may be preferred, and let the milk steep until it is well\r\nflavoured. Then strain the milk, and add it, boiling, to the mixed\r\narrowroot; sweeten it with sifted sugar, and let it boil, stirring it\r\nall the time, till it thickens sufficiently to come from the saucepan.\r\nGrease a mould with pure salad-oil, pour in the blanc-mange, and when\r\nquite set, turn it out on a dish, and pour round it a compôte of any\r\nkind of fruit, or garnish it with jam. A tablespoonful of brandy,\r\nstirred in just before the blanc-mange is moulded, very much improves\r\nthe flavour of this sweet dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d. without the garnishing.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLANC-MANGE.\r\n\r\n(_A Supper Dish_.)\r\n\r\n1408. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of new milk, 1-1/4 oz. of isinglass, the rind\r\nof 1/2 lemon, 1/4 lb. of loaf sugar, 10 bitter almonds, 1/2 oz. of sweet\r\nalmonds, 1 pint of cream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLANC-MANGE MOULD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk into a saucepan, with the isinglass, lemon-rind,\r\nand sugar, and let these ingredients stand by the side of the fire until\r\nthe milk is well flavoured; add the almonds, which should be blanched\r\nand pounded in a mortar to a paste, and let the milk just boil up;\r\nstrain it through a fine sieve or muslin into a jug, add the cream, and\r\nstir the mixture occasionally until nearly cold. Let it stand for a few\r\nminutes, then pour it into the mould, which should be previously oiled\r\nwith the purest salad-oil, or dipped in cold water. There will be a\r\nsediment at the bottom of the jug, which must not be poured into the\r\nmould, as, when turned out, it would very much disfigure the appearance\r\nof the blanc-mange. This blanc-mange may be made very much richer by\r\nusing 1-1/2 pint of cream, and melting the isinglass in 1/2 pint of\r\nboiling water. The flavour may also be very much varied by adding\r\nbay-leaves, laurel-leaves, or essence of vanilla, instead of the\r\nlemon-rind and almonds. Noyeau, Maraschino, Curaçoa, or any favourite\r\nliqueur, added in small proportions, very much enhances the flavour of\r\nthis always favourite dish. In turning it out, just loosen the edges of\r\nthe blanc-mange from the mould, place a dish on it, and turn it quickly\r\nover; it should come out easily, and the blanc-mange have a smooth\r\nglossy appearance when the mould is oiled, which it frequently has not\r\nwhen it is only dipped in water. It may be garnished as fancy dictates.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1-1/2 hour to steep the lemon-rind and almonds in the\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with cream at 1s. per pint, 3s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a quart mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEAP BLANC-MANGE.\r\n\r\n1409. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of sugar, 1 quart of milk, 1-1/2 oz. of\r\nisinglass, the rind of 1/2 lemon, 4 laurel-leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLANC-MANGE.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a lined saucepan, and boil gently\r\nuntil the isinglass is dissolved; taste it occasionally, to ascertain\r\nwhen it is sufficiently flavoured with the laurel-leaves; then take them\r\nout, and keep stirring the mixture over the fire for about 10 minutes.\r\nStrain it through a fine sieve into a jug, and, when nearly cold, pour\r\nit into a well-oiled mould, omitting the sediment at the bottom. Turn it\r\nout carefully on a dish, and garnish with preserves, bright jelly, or a\r\ncompote of fruit.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a quart mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAD-AND-BUTTER FRITTERS.\r\n\r\n1410. INGREDIENTS.--Batter, 8 slices of bread and butter, 3 or 4\r\ntablespoonfuls of jam.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a batter, the same as for apple fritters No. 1393; cut\r\nsome slices of bread and butter, not very thick; spread half of them\r\nwith any jam that may he preferred, and cover with the other slices;\r\nslightly press them together, and cut them out in square, long, or round\r\npieces. Dip them in the batter, and fry in boiling lard for about 10\r\nminutes; drain them before the fire on a piece of blotting-paper or\r\ncloth. Dish them, sprinkle over sifted sugar, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE THE STOCK FOR JELLY, AND TO CLARIFY IT.\r\n\r\n1411. INGREDIENTS.--2 calf's feet, 6 pints of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JELLY-MOULD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JELLY-BAG.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--The stock for jellies should always be made the day before it\r\nis required for use, as the liquor has time to cool, and the fat can be\r\nso much more easily and effectually removed when thoroughly set. Procure\r\nfrom the butcher's 2 nice calf's feet: scald them, to take off the hair;\r\nslit them in two, remove the fat from between the claws, and wash the\r\nfeet well in warm water; put them into a stewpan, with the above\r\nproportion of cold water, bring it gradually to boil, and remove every\r\nparticle of scum as it rises. When it is well skimmed, boil it very\r\ngently for 6 or 7 hours, or until the liquor is reduced rather more than\r\nhalf; then strain it through a sieve into a basin, and put it in a cool\r\nplace to set. As the liquor is strained, measure it, to ascertain the\r\nproportion for the jelly, allowing something for the sediment and fat at\r\nthe top. To clarify it, carefully remove all the fat from the top, pour\r\nover a little warm water, to wash away any that may remain, and wipe the\r\njelly with a clean cloth; remove the jelly from the sediment, put it\r\ninto a saucepan, and, supposing the quantity to be a quart, add to it 6\r\noz. of loaf sugar, the shells and well-whisked whites of 5 eggs, and\r\nstir these ingredients together cold; set the saucepan on the fire, but\r\n_do not stir the jelly after it begins to warm_. Let it boil about 10\r\nminutes after it rises to a head, then throw in a teacupful of cold\r\nwater; let it boil 5 minutes longer, then take the saucepan off, cover\r\nit closely, and let it remain 1/2 hour near the fire. Dip the jelly-bag\r\ninto hot water, wring it out quite dry, and fasten it on to a stand or\r\nthe back of a chair, which must be placed near the fire, to prevent the\r\njelly from setting before it has run through the bag. Place a basin\r\nunderneath to receive the jelly; then pour it into the bag, and should\r\nit not be clear the first time, run it through the bag again. This stock\r\nis the foundation of all _really good_ jellies, which may be varied in\r\ninnumerable ways, by colouring and flavouring with liqueurs, and by\r\nmoulding it with fresh and preserved fruits. To insure the jelly being\r\nfirm when turned out, 1/2 oz. of isinglass clarified might be added to\r\nthe above proportion of stock. Substitutes for calf's feet are now\r\nfrequently used in making jellies, which lessen the expense and trouble\r\nin preparing this favourite dish; isinglass and gelatine being two of\r\nthe principal materials employed; but, although they may _look_ as\r\nnicely as jellies made from good stock, they are never so delicate,\r\nhaving very often an unpleasant flavour, somewhat resembling glue,\r\nparticularly when made with gelatine.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 6 hours to boil the feet for the stock; to clarify\r\nit,--1/4 hour to boil, 1/2 hour to stand in the saucepan covered.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_.--Calf's feet may be purchased for 6d. each when veal is\r\nin full season, but more expensive when it is scarce.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--2 calf's feet should make 1 quart of stock.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October, but may be had all the year.\r\n\r\n    HOW TO MAKE A JELLY-BAG.--The very stout flannel called\r\n    double-mill, used for ironing-blankets, is the best material for\r\n    a jelly-bag: those of home manufacture are the only ones to be\r\n    relied on for thoroughly clearing the jelly. Care should be\r\n    taken that the seam of the bag be stitched twice, to secure it\r\n    against unequal filtration. The most convenient mode of using\r\n    the big is to tie it upon a hoop the exact size of the outside\r\n    of its mouth; and, to do this, strings should be sewn round it\r\n    at equal distances. The jelly-bag may, of coarse, be made any\r\n    size; but one of twelve or fourteen inches deep, and seven or\r\n    eight across the mouth, will be sufficient for ordinary use. The\r\n    form of a jelly-bag is the fool's cap.\r\n\r\nCOW-HEEL STOCK FOR JELLIES.\r\n\r\n(More Economical than Calf's Feet.)\r\n\r\n1412. INGREDIENTS.--2 cow-heels, 3 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure 2 heels that have only been scalded, and not boiled;\r\nsplit them in two, and remove the fat between the claws; wash them well\r\nin warm water, and put them into a saucepan with the above proportion of\r\ncold water; bring it gradually to boil, remove all the scum as it rises,\r\nand simmer the heels gently from 7 to 8 hours, or until the liquor is\r\nreduced one-half; then strain it into a basin, measuring the quantity,\r\nand put it in a cool place. Clarify it in the same manner as calf's-feet\r\nstock No. 1411, using, with the other ingredients, about 1/2 oz. of\r\nisinglass to each quart. This stock should be made the day before it is\r\nrequired for use. Two dozen shank-bones of mutton, boiled for 6 or 7\r\nhours, yield a quart of strong firm stock. They should be put on in 2\r\nquarts of water, which should be reduced one-half. Make this also the\r\nday before it is required.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--7 to 8 hours to boil the cow-heels, 6 to 7 hours to boil the\r\nshank-bones.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 4d. to 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--2 cow-heels should make 3 pints of stock.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nISINGLASS OR GELATINE JELLY.\r\n\r\n(_Substitutes for Calf's Feet_.)\r\n\r\n1413. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of isinglass or gelatine, 2 quarts of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the isinglass or gelatine into a saucepan with the above\r\nproportion of cold water; bring it quickly to boil, and let it boil very\r\nfast, until the liquor is reduced one-half. Carefully remove the scum as\r\nit rises, then strain it through a jelly-bag, and it will be ready for\r\nuse. If not required very clear, it may be merely strained through a\r\nfine sieve, instead of being run through a bag. Rather more than 1/2 oz.\r\nof isinglass is about the proper quantity to use for a quart of strong\r\ncalf's-feet stock, and rather more than 2 oz. for the same quantity of\r\nfruit juice. As isinglass varies so much in quality and strength, it is\r\ndifficult to give the exact proportions. The larger the mould, the\r\nstiffer should be the jelly; and where there is no ice, more isinglass\r\nmust be used than if the mixture were frozen. This forms a stock for all\r\nkinds of jellies, which may be flavoured in many ways.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, with wine, syrup, fruit, &c., to fill two moderate-sized\r\nmoulds.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The above, when boiled, should be perfectly clear, and may be\r\nmixed warm with wine, flavourings, fruits, &c., and then run through the\r\nbag.\r\n\r\n    ISINGLASS.--The best isinglass is brought from Russia; some of\r\n    an inferior kind is brought from North and South America and the\r\n    East Indies: the several varieties may be had from the wholesale\r\n    dealers in isinglass in London. In choosing isinglass for\r\n    domestic use, select that which is whitest, has no unpleasant\r\n    odour, and which dissolves most readily in water. The inferior\r\n    kinds are used for fining beer, and similar purposes. Isinglass\r\n    is much adulterated: to test its purity, take a few threads of\r\n    the substance, drop some into boiling water, some into cold\r\n    water, and some into vinegar. In the boiling water the isinglass\r\n    will dissolve, in cold water it will become white and \"cloudy,\"\r\n    and in vinegar it will swell and become jelly-like. If the\r\n    isinglass is adulterated with gelatine (that is to say, the\r\n    commoner sorts of gelatine,--for isinglass is classed amongst\r\n    gelatines, of all which varieties it is the very purest and\r\n    best), in boiling water the gelatine will not so completely\r\n    dissolve as the isinglass; in cold water it becomes clear and\r\n    jelly-like; and in vinegar it will harden.\r\n\r\nHOW TO MOULD BOTTLED JELLIES.\r\n\r\n1414. Uncork the bottle; place it in a saucepan of hot water until the\r\njelly is reduced to a liquid state; taste it, to ascertain whether it is\r\nsufficiently flavoured, and if not, add a little wine. Pour the jelly\r\ninto moulds which have been soaked in water; let it set, and turn it out\r\nby placing the mould in hot water for a minute; then wipe the outside,\r\nput a dish on the top, and turn it over quickly. The jelly should then\r\nslip easily away from the mould, and be quite firm. It may be garnished\r\nas taste dictates.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CLARIFY SYRUP FOR JELLIES.\r\n\r\n1415. INGREDIENTS.--To every quart of water allow 2 lbs. of loaf sugar;\r\nthe white of 1 egg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the sugar and water into a stewpan; set it on the fire,\r\nand, when the sugar is dissolved, add the white of the egg, whipped up\r\nwith a little water. Whisk the whole well together, and simmer very\r\ngently until it has thrown up all the scum. Take this off as it rises,\r\nstrain the syrup through a fine sieve or cloth into a basin, and keep it\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALF'S-FEET JELLY.\r\n\r\n1416. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of calf's-feet stock No. 1411, 1/2 lb. of\r\nsugar, 1/2 pint of sherry, 1 glass of brandy, the shells and whites of 5\r\neggs, the rind and juice of 2 lemons, 1/2 oz. of isinglass.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Prepare the stock as directed in recipe No. 1411, taking care\r\nto leave the sediment, and to remove all the fat from the surface. Put\r\nit into a saucepan, cold, without clarifying it; add the remaining\r\ningredients, and stir them well together before the saucepan is placed\r\non the fire. Then simmer the mixture gently for 1/4 hour, _but do not\r\nstir it after it begins to warm_. Throw in a teacupful of cold water,\r\nboil for another 5 minutes, and keep the saucepan covered by the side of\r\nthe fire for about 1/2 hour, but do not let it boil again. In simmering,\r\nthe head or scum may be carefully removed as it rises; but particular\r\nattention must be given to the jelly, that it be not stirred in the\r\nslightest degree after it is heated. The isinglass should be added when\r\nthe jelly begins to boil: this assists to clear it, and makes it firmer\r\nfor turning out. Wring out a jelly-bag in hot water; fasten it on to a\r\nstand, or the back of a chair; place it near the fire with a basin\r\nunderneath it, and run the jelly through it. Should it not be perfectly\r\nclear the first time, repeat the process until the desired brilliancy is\r\nobtained. Soak the moulds in water, drain them for half a second, pour\r\nin the jelly, and put it in a cool place to set. If ice is at hand,\r\nsurround the moulds with it, and the jelly will set sooner, and be\r\nfirmer when turned out. In summer it is necessary to have ice in which\r\nto put the moulds, or the cook will be, very likely, disappointed, by\r\nher jellies being in too liquid a state to turn out properly, unless a\r\ngreat deal of isinglass is used. When wanted for table, dip the moulds\r\nin hot water for a minute, wipe the outside with a cloth, lay a dish on\r\nthe top of the mould, turn it quickly over, and the jelly should slip\r\nout easily. It is sometimes served broken into square lumps, and piled\r\nhigh in glasses. Earthenware moulds are preferable to those of pewter or\r\ntin, for red jellies, the colour and transparency of the composition\r\nbeing often spoiled by using the latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JELLY-MOULD.]\r\n\r\nTo make this jelly more economically, raisin wine may be substituted for\r\nthe sherry and brandy, and the stock made from cow-heels, instead of\r\ncalf's feet.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to simmer the jelly, 1/2 hour to stand covered.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, reckoning the feet at 6d. each, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill two 1-1/2-pint moulds. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--As lemon-juice, unless carefully strained, is liable to make\r\nthe jelly muddy, see that it is clear before it is added to the other\r\ningredients. Omit the brandy when the flavour is objected to.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHERRY.--There are several kinds of sherry, as pale and brown, and there\r\nare various degrees of each. Sherry is, in general, of an amber-colour,\r\nand, when good, has a fine aromatic odour, with something of the\r\nagreeable bitterness of the peach kernel. When new, it is harsh and\r\nfiery, and requires to be mellowed in the wood for four or five years.\r\nSherry has of late got much into fashion in England, from the idea that\r\nit is more free from acid than other wines; but some careful experiments\r\non wines do not fully confirm this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNELONS, or FRIED PUFFS.\r\n\r\n(_Sweet Entremets_.)\r\n\r\n1417. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of puff-paste No. 1205; apricot, or any kind\r\nof preserve that may be preferred; hot lard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cannelons which are made of puff-paste rolled very thin, with\r\njam inclosed, and cut out in long narrow rolls or puffs, make a very\r\npretty and elegant dish. Make some good puff-paste, by recipe No. 1205;\r\nroll it out very thin, and cut it into pieces of an equal size, about 2\r\ninches wide and 8 inches long; place upon each piece a spoonful of jam,\r\nwet the edges with the white of egg, and fold the paste over _twice;_\r\nslightly press the edges together, that the jam may not escape in the\r\nfrying; and when all are prepared, fry them in boiling lard until of a\r\nnice brown, letting them remain by the side of the fire after they are\r\ncoloured, that the paste may be thoroughly done. Drain them before the\r\nfire, dish on a d'oyley, sprinkle over them sifted sugar, and serve.\r\nThese cannelons are very delicious made with fresh instead of preserved\r\nfruit, such as strawberries, raspberries, or currants: it should be laid\r\nin the paste, plenty of pounded sugar sprinkled over, and folded and\r\nfried in the same manner as stated above.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 10 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--1/2 lb. of paste for a moderate-sized dish of cannelons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_, with jam, at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLOTTE-AUX-POMMES.\r\n\r\n1418. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of rather stale bread 1/2 inch thick,\r\nclarified butter, apple marmalade made by recipe No. 1395, with about 2\r\ndozen apples, 1/2 glass of sherry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLOTTE-AUX-POMMES.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut a slice of bread the same shape as the bottom of a plain\r\nround mould, which has been well buttered, and a few strips the height\r\nof the mould, and about 1-1/2 inch wide; dip the bread in clarified\r\nbutter (or spread it with cold butter, if not wanted quite so rich);\r\nplace the round piece at the bottom of the mould, and set the narrow\r\nstrips up the sides of it, overlapping each other a little, that no\r\njuice from the apples may escape, and that they may hold firmly to the\r\nmould. Brush the _interior_ over with white of egg (this will assist to\r\nmake the case firmer); fill it with apple marmalade made by recipe No.\r\n1395, with the addition of a little sherry, and cover them with a round\r\npiece of bread, also brushed over with egg, the same as the bottom;\r\nslightly press the bread down, to make it adhere to the other pieces;\r\nput a plate on the top, and bake the _charlotte_ in a brisk oven, of a\r\nlight colour. Turn it out on the dish, strew sifted sugar over the top,\r\nand pour round it a little melted apricot jam.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--40 to 50 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EASY METHOD OF MAKING A CHARLOTTE-AUX-POMMES.\r\n\r\n1419. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of flour, 1/4 lb. of butter, 1/4 lb. of\r\npowdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoonful of baking-powder, 1 egg, milk, 1 glass\r\nof raisin-wine, apple marmalade No. 1395, 1/4 pint of cream, 2\r\ndessertspoonfuls of pounded sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a cake with the flour, butter, sugar, and baking-powder;\r\nmoisten with the egg and sufficient milk to make it the proper\r\nconsistency, and bake it in a round tin. When cold, scoop out the\r\nmiddle, leaving a good thickness all round the sides, to prevent them\r\nbreaking; take some of the scooped-out pieces, which should be trimmed\r\ninto neat slices; lay them in the cake, and pour over sufficient\r\nraisin-wine, with the addition of a little brandy, if approved, to soak\r\nthem well. Have ready some apple marmalade, made by recipe No. 1395;\r\nplace a layer of this over the soaked cake, then a layer of cake and a\r\nlayer of apples; whip the cream to a froth, mixing with it the sugar and\r\nlemon-juice; pile it on the top of the _charlotte_, and garnish it with\r\npieces of clear apple jelly. This dish is served cold, but may be eaten\r\nhot, by omitting the cream, and merely garnishing the top with bright\r\njelly just before it is sent to table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour to bake the cake. _Average cost_, 2s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VERY SIMPLE APPLE CHARLOTTE.\r\n\r\n1420. INGREDIENTS.--9 slices of bread and butter, about 6 good-sized\r\napples, 1 tablespoonful of minced lemon-peel, 2 tablespoonfuls of juice,\r\nmoist sugar to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Butter a pie-dish; place a layer of bread and butter, without\r\nthe crust, at the bottom; then a layer of apples, pared, cored, and cut\r\ninto thin slices; sprinkle over these a portion of the lemon-peel and\r\njuice, and sweeten with moist sugar. Place another layer of bread and\r\nbutter, and then one of apples, proceeding in this manner until the dish\r\nis full; then cover it up with the peel of the apples, to preserve the\r\ntop from browning or burning; bake in a brisk oven for rather more than\r\n3/4 hour; torn the charlotte on a dish, sprinkle sifted sugar over, and\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLOTTE RUSSE.\r\n\r\n(_An Elegant Sweet Entremets_.)\r\n\r\n1421. INGREDIENTS.--About 18 Savoy biscuits, 3/4 pint of cream,\r\nflavouring of vanilla, liqueurs, or wine, 1 tablespoonful of pounded\r\nsugar, 1/2 oz. of isinglass.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure about 18 Savoy biscuits, or ladies'-fingers, as they\r\nare sometimes called; brush the edges of them with the white of an egg,\r\nand line the bottom of a plain round mould, placing them like a star or\r\nrosette. Stand them upright all round the edge; carefully put them so\r\nclosely together that the white of the egg connects them firmly, and\r\nplace this case in the oven for about 5 minutes, just to dry the egg.\r\nWhisk the cream to a stiff froth, with the sugar, flavouring, and melted\r\nisinglass; fill the charlotte with it, cover with a slice of sponge-cake\r\ncut in the shape of the mould; place it in ice, where let it remain till\r\nready for table; then turn it on a dish, remove the mould, and serve. 1\r\ntablespoonful of liqueur of any kind, or 4 tablespoonfuls of wine, would\r\nnicely flavour the above proportion of cream. For arranging the biscuits\r\nin the mould, cut them to the shape required, so that they fit in\r\nnicely, and level them with the mould at the top, that, when turned out,\r\nthere may be something firm to rest upon. Great care and attention is\r\nrequired in the turning out of this dish, that the cream does not burst\r\nthe case; and the edges of the biscuits must have the smallest quantity\r\nof egg brushed over them, or it would stick to the mould, and so prevent\r\nthe charlotte from coming away properly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes in the oven.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with cream at 1s. per pint, 2s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 charlotte. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAM A LA VALOIS.\r\n\r\n1422. INGREDIENTS.--4 sponge-cakes, jam, 3/4 pint of cream, sugar to\r\ntaste, the juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/4 glass of sherry, 1-1/4 oz. of\r\nisinglass.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the sponge-cakes into thin slices; place two together, with\r\npreserve between them, and pour over them a small quantity of sherry\r\nmixed with a little brandy. Sweeten and flavour the cream with the\r\nlemon-juice and sherry; add the isinglass, which should be dissolved in\r\na little water, and beat up the cream well. Place a little in an oiled\r\nmould; arrange the pieces of cake in the cream; then fill the mould with\r\nthe remainder; let it cool, and turn it out on a dish. By oiling the\r\nmould, the cream will have a much smoother appearance, and will turn out\r\nmore easily than when merely dipped in cold water.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a 1-1/2 pint mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED CUSTARDS.\r\n\r\n1423. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 5 eggs, 3 oz. of loaf sugar, 3\r\nlaurel-leaves, or the rind of 4 lemon, or a few drops of essence of\r\nvanilla, 1 tablespoonful of brandy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUSTARDS IN GLASSES.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk into a lined saucepan, with the sugar, and\r\nwhichever of the above flavourings may be preferred (the lemon-rind\r\nflavours custards most deliciously), and let the milk steep by the side\r\nof the fire until it is well flavoured. Bring it to the point of\r\nboiling, then strain it into a basin; whisk the eggs well, and, when the\r\nmilk has cooled a little, stir in the eggs, and _strain_ this mixture\r\ninto a jug. Place this jug in a saucepan of boiling water over the fire;\r\nkeep stirring the custard _one way_ until it thickens; but on no account\r\nallow it to reach the boiling-point, as it will instantly curdle and be\r\nfull of lumps. Take it off the fire, stir in the brandy, and, when this\r\nis well mixed with the custard, pour it into glasses, which should be\r\nrather more than three-parts full; grate a little nutmeg over the top,\r\nand the dish is ready for table. To make custards look and eat better,\r\nducks' eggs should be used, when obtainable; they add very much to the\r\nflavour and richness, and so many are not required as of the ordinary\r\neggs, 4 ducks' eggs to the pint of milk making a delicious custard. When\r\ndesired extremely rich and good, cream should be substituted for the\r\nmilk, and double the quantity of eggs used, to those mentioned, omitting\r\nthe whites.\r\n\r\n_Time_. 1/2 hour to infuse the lemon-rind, about 10 minutes to stir the\r\ncustard. _Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill 8 custard-glasses. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nGINGER APPLES.\r\n\r\n(_A pretty Supper or Dessert Dish_.)\r\n\r\n1424. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 oz. of whole ginger, 1/4 pint of whiskey, 3\r\nlbs. of apples, 2 lbs. of white sugar, the juice of 2 lemons.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Bruise the ginger, put it into a small jar, pour over\r\nsufficient whiskey to cover it, and let it remain for 3 days; then cut\r\nthe apples into thin slices, after paring and coring them; add the sugar\r\nand the lemon-juice, which should he strained; and simmer all together\r\n_very gently_ until the apples are transparent, but not broken. Serve\r\ncold, and garnish the dish with slices of candied lemon-peel or\r\npreserved ginger.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 days to soak the ginger; about 3/4 hour to simmer the apples\r\nvery gently.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 dishes. _Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH PANCAKES.\r\n\r\n1425. INGREDIENTS.--2 eggs, 2 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of sifted sugar, 2\r\noz. of flour, 1/2 pint of new milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat the eggs thoroughly, and put them into a basin with the\r\nbutter, which should be beaten to a cream; stir in the sugar and flour,\r\nand when these ingredients are well mixed, add the milk; keep stirring\r\nand beating the mixture for a few minutes; put it on buttered plates,\r\nand bake in a quick oven for 20 minutes. Serve with a cut lemon and\r\nsifted sugar, or pile the pancakes high on a dish, with a layer of\r\npreserve or marmalade between each.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes. _Average cost_, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTCH FLUMMERY.\r\n\r\n1426. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 oz. of isinglass, the rind and juice of 1\r\nlemon, 1 pint of water, 4 eggs, 1 pint of sherry, Madeira, or\r\nraisin-wine; sifted sugar to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the water, isinglass, and lemon-rind into a lined saucepan,\r\nand simmer gently until the isinglass is dissolved; strain this into a\r\nbasin, stir in the eggs, which should be well beaten, the lemon-juice,\r\nwhich should be strained, and the wine; sweeten to taste with pounded\r\nsugar, mix all well together, pour it into a jug, set this jug in a\r\nsaucepan of boiling water over the fire, and keep stirring it one way\r\nuntil it thickens; but _take care that it does not boil_. Strain it into\r\na mould that has been oiled or laid in water for a short time, and put\r\nit in a cool place to set. A tablespoonful of brandy stirred in just\r\nbefore it is poured into the mould, improves the flavour of this dish:\r\nit is better if made the day before it is required for table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to simmer the isinglass; about 1/4 hour to stir the\r\nmixture over the fire.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4s. 6d., if made with sherry; less with raisin-wine.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a quart mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    PALE SHERRIES are made from the same grapes as brown. The latter\r\n    are coloured by an addition of some cheap must, or wine which\r\n    has been boiled till it has acquired a deep-brown tint. Pale\r\n    sherries were, some time ago, preferred in England, being\r\n    supposed most pure; but the brown are preferred by many people.\r\n    The inferior sherries exported to England are often mixed with a\r\n    cheap and light wine called Moguer, and are strengthened in the\r\n    making by brandy; but too frequently they are adulterated by the\r\n    London dealers.\r\n\r\nCHOCOLATE SOUFFLE.\r\n\r\n1427. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 3 teaspoonfuls of pounded sugar, 1\r\nteaspoonful of flour, 3 oz. of the best chocolate.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Break the eggs, separating the whites from the yolks, and put\r\nthem into different basins; add to the yolks the sugar, flour, and\r\nchocolate, which should be very finely grated, and stir these\r\ningredients for 5 minutes. Then well whisk the whites of the eggs in the\r\nother basin, until they are stiff, and, when firm, mix lightly with the\r\nyolks, till the whole forms a smooth and light substance; butter a round\r\ncake-tin, put in the mixture, and bake in a moderate oven from 15 to 20\r\nminutes. Pin a white napkin round the tin, strew sifted sugar over the\r\ntop of the soufflé, and send it immediately to table. The proper\r\nappearance of this dish depends entirely on the expedition with which it\r\nis served, and some cooks, to preserve its lightness, hold a salamander\r\nover the soufflé until it is placed on the table. If allowed to stand\r\nafter it comes from the oven, it will be entirely spoiled, as it falls\r\nalmost immediately.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 to 20 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a moderate-sized soufflé. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nDARIOLES A LA VANILLE.\r\n\r\n(_Sweet Entremets_.)\r\n\r\n1428. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of milk, 1/2 pint of cream, 2 oz. of flour,\r\n3 oz. of pounded sugar, 6 eggs, 2 oz. of butter, puff-paste, flavouring\r\nof essence of vanilla.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the flour to a smooth batter, with the milk; stir in the\r\ncream, sugar, the eggs, which should be well whisked, and the butter,\r\nwhich should be beaten to a cream. Put in some essence of vanilla, drop\r\nby drop, until the mixture is well flavoured; line some dariole-moulds\r\nwith puff-paste, three-parts fill them with the batter, and bake in a\r\ngood oven from 25 to 35 minutes. Turn them out of the moulds on a dish,\r\nwithout breaking them; strew over sifted sugar, and serve. The\r\nflavouring of the darioles may be varied by substituting lemon,\r\ncinnamon, or almonds, for the vanilla.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--25 to 35 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill 6 or 7 dariole-moulds. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRANT FRITTERS.\r\n\r\n1429. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of milk, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 4 eggs,\r\n3 tablespoonfuls of boiled rice, 3 tablespoonfuls of currants, sugar to\r\ntaste, a very little grated nutmeg, hot lard or clarified dripping.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk into a basin with the flour, which should\r\npreviously be rubbed to a smooth batter with a little cold milk; stir\r\nthese ingredients together; add the well-whisked eggs, the rice,\r\ncurrants, sugar, and nutmeg. Beat the mixture for a few minutes, and, if\r\nnot sufficiently thick, add a little more boiled rice; drop it, in small\r\nquantities, into a pan of boiling lard or clarified dripping; fry the\r\nfritters a nice brown, and, when done, drain them on a piece of\r\nblotting-paper, before the fire. Pile them on a white d'oyley, strew\r\nover sifted sugar, and serve them very hot. Send a cut lemon to table\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 8 to 10 minutes to fry the fritters.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOCOLATE CREAM.\r\n\r\n1430. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of grated chocolate, 1/4 lb. of sugar, 1-1/2\r\npint of cream, 1/2 oz. of clarified isinglass, the yolks of 6 eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CREAM-MOULD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat the yolks of the eggs well; put them into a basin with the\r\ngrated chocolate, the sugar, and 1 pint of the cream; stir these\r\ningredients well together, pour them into a jug, and set this jug in a\r\nsaucepan of boiling water; stir it one way until the mixture thickens,\r\nbut _do not allow it to boil_, or it will curdle. Strain the cream\r\nthrough a sieve into a basin; stir in the isinglass and the other 1/2\r\npint of cream, which should be well whipped; mix all well together, and\r\npour it into a mould which has been previously oiled with the purest\r\nsalad-oil, and, if at hand, set it in ice until wanted for table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 10 minutes to stir the mixture over the fire.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4s. 6d, with cream at 1s. per pint.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a quart mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENEVA WAFERS.\r\n\r\n1431. INGREDIENTS.--2 eggs, 3 oz. of butter, 3 oz. of flour, 3 oz. of\r\npounded sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Well whisk the eggs; put them into a basin, and stir to them\r\nthe butter, which should be beaten to a cream; add the flour and sifted\r\nsugar gradually, and then mix all well together. Butter a baking-sheet,\r\nand drop on it a teaspoonful of the mixture at a time, leaving a space\r\nbetween each. Bake in a cool oven; watch the pieces of paste, and, when\r\nhalf done, roll them up like wafers, and put in a small wedge of bread\r\nor piece of wood, to keep them in shape. Return them to the oven until\r\ncrisp. Before serving, remove the bread, put a spoonful of preserve in\r\nthe widest end, and fill up with whipped cream. This is a very pretty\r\nand ornamental dish for the supper-table, and is very nice and very\r\neasily made.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 20 to 25 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the preserve and cream, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a nice-sized dish. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nGINGER CREAM.\r\n\r\n1432. INGREDIENTS.--The yolks of 4 eggs, 1 pint of cream, 3 oz. of\r\npreserved ginger, 2 dessertspoonfuls of syrup, sifted sugar to taste, 1\r\noz. of isinglass.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice the ginger finely; put it into a basin with the syrup,\r\nthe well-beaten yolks of eggs, and the cream; mix these ingredients well\r\ntogether, and stir them over the fire for about 10 minutes, or until the\r\nmixture thickens; then take it off the fire, whisk till nearly cold,\r\nsweeten to taste, add the isinglass, which should be melted and\r\nstrained, and serve the cream in a glass dish. It may be garnished with\r\nslices of preserved ginger or candied citron.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 10 minutes to stir the cream over the fire.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with cream at 1s. per pint, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a good-sized dish. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    PRESERVED GINGER comes to us from the West Indies. It is made by\r\n    scalding the roots when they are green and full of sap, then\r\n    peeling them in cold water, and putting them into jars, with a\r\n    rich syrup; in which state we receive them. It should be chosen\r\n    of a bright-yellow colour, with a little transparency: what is\r\n    dark-coloured, fibrous, and stringy, is not good. Ginger roots,\r\n    fit for preserving, and in size equal to West Indian, have been\r\n    produced in the Royal Agricultural Garden in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nTO MAKE GOOSEBERRY FOOL.\r\n\r\n1433. INGREDIENTS.--Green gooseberries; to every pint of pulp add 1 pint\r\nof milk, or 1/2 pint of cream and 1/2 pint of milk; sugar to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the tops and tails off the gooseberries; put them into a\r\njar, with 2 tablespoonfuls of water and a little good moist sugar; set\r\nthis jar in a saucepan of boiling water, and let it boil until the fruit\r\nis soft enough to mash. When done enough, beat it to a pulp, work this\r\npulp through a colander, and stir to every pint the above proportion of\r\nmilk, or equal quantities of milk and cream. Ascertain if the mixture is\r\nsweet enough, and put in plenty of sugar, or it will not be eatable; and\r\nin mixing the milk and gooseberries, add the former very gradually to\r\nthese: serve in a glass dish, or in small glasses. This, although a very\r\nold-fashioned and homely dish, is, when well made, very delicious, and,\r\nif properly sweetened, a very suitable preparation for children.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 3/4 to 1 hour. _Average cost_, 6d. per pint, with milk.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--A pint of milk and a pint of gooseberry pulp for 5 or 6\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in May and June.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRY TRIFLE.\r\n\r\n1434. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of gooseberries, sugar to taste, 1 pint of\r\ncustard No. 1423, a plateful of whipped cream.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the gooseberries into a jar, with sufficient moist sugar to\r\nsweeten them, and boil them until reduced to a pulp. Put this pulp at\r\nthe bottom of a trifle-dish; pour over it a pint of custard made by\r\nrecipe No. 1423, and, when cold, cover with whipped cream. The cream\r\nshould be whipped the day before it is wanted for table, as it will then\r\nbe so much firmer and more solid. The dish may be garnished as fancy\r\ndictates.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3/4 hour to boil the gooseberries.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 trifle. _Seasonable_ in May and June.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN FRITTERS.\r\n\r\n1435. INGREDIENTS.--3 tablespoonfuls of flour, boiling water, the yolks\r\nof 4 eggs, the whites of 2, hot lard or clarified dripping, jam.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the flour into a basin, and pour over it sufficient\r\n_boiling_ water to make it into a stiff paste, taking care to stir and\r\nbeat it well, to prevent it getting lumpy. Leave it a little time to\r\ncool, and then break into it (_without beating them at first_) the yolks\r\nof 4 eggs and the whites of 2, and stir and beat all well together. Have\r\nready some boiling lard or butter; drop a dessertspoonful of batter in\r\nat a time, and fry the fritters of a light brown. They should rise so\r\nmuch as to be almost like balls. Serve on a dish, with a spoonful of\r\npreserve or marmalade dropped in between each fritter. This is an\r\nexcellent dish for a hasty addition to dinner, if a guest unexpectedly\r\narrives, it being so easily and quickly made, and it is always a great\r\nfavourite.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 5 to 8 minutes to fry the fritters.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the jam, 5d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN TRIFLE.\r\n\r\n1436. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of milk, the rind of 1/2 large lemon, sugar\r\nto taste, 5 heaped tablespoonfuls of rice-flour, 1 oz. of sweet almonds,\r\n1/2 pint of custard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the milk and lemon-rind together until the former is well\r\nflavoured; take out the lemon-rind and stir in the rice-flour, which\r\nshould first be moistened with cold milk, and add sufficient loaf sugar\r\nto sweeten it nicely. Boil gently for about 5 minutes, and keep the\r\nmixture stirred; take it off the fire, let it cool _a little_, and pour\r\nit into a glass dish. When cold, cut the rice out in the form of a star,\r\nor any other shape that may be preferred; take out the spare rice, and\r\nfill the space with boiled custard. Blanch and cut the almonds into\r\nstrips; stick them over the trifle, and garnish it with pieces of\r\nbrightly-coloured jelly, or preserved fruits, or candied citron.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to simmer the milk, 5 minutes after the rice is added.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 trifle.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CITRON.]\r\n\r\n    THE CITRON.--The citron belongs to the same species as the\r\n    lemon, being considered only as a variety, the distinction\r\n    between them not being very great. It is larger, and is less\r\n    succulent, but more acid: with a little artificial heat, the\r\n    citron comes to as great perfection in England as in Spain and\r\n    Italy. The fruit is oblong and about five or six inches in\r\n    length. The tree is thorny. The juice forms an excellent\r\n    lemonade with sugar and water; its uses in punch, negus, and in\r\n    medicine, are well known. The rind is very thick, and, when\r\n    candied with sugar, forms an excellent sweetmeat. There are\r\n    several varieties cultivated in England, one of which is termed\r\n    the Forbidden Fruit.\r\n\r\nITALIAN CREAM.\r\n\r\n1437. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, 4 pint of cream, sugar to taste, 1\r\noz. of isinglass, 1 lemon, the yolks of 4 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the cream and milk into a saucepan, with sugar to sweeten,\r\nand the lemon-rind. Boil until the milk is well flavoured then strain it\r\ninto a basin, and add the beaten yolks of eggs. Put this mixture into a\r\njug; place the jug in a saucepan of boiling water over the fire, and\r\nstir the contents until they thicken, but do not allow them to boil.\r\nTake the cream off the fire, stir in the lemon-juice and isinglass,\r\nwhich should be melted, and whip well; fill a mould, place it in ice if\r\nat hand, and, when set, turn it out on a dish, and garnish as taste may\r\ndictate. The mixture may be whipped and drained, and then put into small\r\nglasses, when this mode of serving is preferred.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 5 to 8 minutes to stir the mixture in the jug.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with the best isinglass, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill 1-1/2-pint mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HIDDEN MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n(_A pretty Supper Dish_.)\r\n\r\n1438. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, a few slices of citron, sugar to taste, 1/4\r\npint of cream, a layer of any kind of jam.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat the whites and yolks of the eggs separately; then mix them\r\nand beat well again, adding a few thin slices of citron, the cream, and\r\nsufficient pounded sugar to sweeten it nicely. When the mixture is well\r\nbeaten, put it into a buttered pan, and fry the same as a pancake; but\r\nit should be three times the thickness of an ordinary pancake. Cover it\r\nwith jam, and garnish with slices of citron and holly-leaves. This dish\r\nis served cold.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 10 minutes to fry the mixture.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with the jam, 1s. 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNEMANGE.\r\n\r\n1439. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of isinglass, 1 pint of water, 1/2 pint of\r\nwhite wine, the rind and juice of 1 large lemon, sugar to taste, the\r\nyolks of 6 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the isinglass, water, and lemon-rind into a saucepan, and\r\nboil gently until the former is dissolved; then add the strained\r\nlemon-juice, the wine, and sufficient white sugar to sweeten the whole\r\nnicely. Boil for 2 or 3 minutes, strain the mixture into a jug, and add\r\nthe yolks of the eggs, which should be well beaten; place the jug in a\r\nsaucepan of boiling water; keep stirring the mixture _one way_ until it\r\nthickens, _but do not allow it to boil_; then take it off the fire, and\r\nkeep stirring until nearly cold. Pour it into a mould, omitting the\r\nsediment at the bottom of the jug, and let it remain until quite firm.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to boil the isinglass and water; about 10 minutes to\r\nstir the mixture in the jug.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with the best isinglass, 2s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a quart mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nJELLY MOULDED WITH FRESH FRUIT, or MACEDOINE DE FRUITS.\r\n\r\n1440. INGREDIENTS.--Rather more than 1-1/2 pint of jelly, a few nice\r\nstrawberries, or red or white currants, or raspberries, or any fresh\r\nfruit that may be in season.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have ready the above proportion of jelly, which must be very\r\nclear and rather sweet, the raw fruit requiring an additional quantity\r\nof sugar. Select ripe, nice-looking fruit; pick off the stalks, unless\r\ncurrants are used, when they are laid in the jelly as they come from the\r\ntree. Begin by putting a little jelly at the bottom of the mould, which\r\nmust harden; then arrange the fruit round the sides of the mould,\r\nrecollecting; that _it will be reversed when turned out;_ then pour in\r\nsome more jelly to make the fruit adhere, and, when that layer is set,\r\nput another row of fruit and jelly until the mould is full. If\r\nconvenient, put it in ice until required for table, then wring a cloth\r\nin boiling water, wrap it round the mould for a minute, and turn the\r\njelly carefully out. Peaches, apricots, plums, apples, &c., are better\r\nfor being boiled in a little clear syrup before they are laid in the\r\njelly; strawberries, raspberries, grapes, cherries, and currants are put\r\nin raw. In winter, when fresh fruits are not obtainable, a very pretty\r\njelly may be made with preserved fruits or brandy cherries: these, in a\r\nbright and clear jelly, have a very pretty effect; of course, unless the\r\njelly be _very clear_, the beauty of the dish will be spoiled. It may be\r\ngarnished with the same fruit as is laid in the jelly; for instance, an\r\nopen jelly with strawberries might have, piled in the centre, a few of\r\nthe same fruit prettily arranged, or a little whipped cream might be\r\nsubstituted for the fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JELLY MOULDED WITH CHERRIES.]\r\n\r\n_Time_.--One layer of jelly should remain 2 hours in a very cool place,\r\nbefore another layer is added. _Average cost_, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, with fruit, to fill a quart mould.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_, with fresh fruit, from June to October; with dried, at any\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nJELLY OF TWO COLOURS.\r\n\r\n1441. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of calf's-feet jelly No. 1416, a few\r\ndrops of prepared cochineal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JELLY OF TWO COLOURS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make 1-1/2 pint of jelly by recipe No. 1416, or, if wished more\r\neconomical, of clarified syrup and gelatine, flavouring it in any way\r\nthat may be preferred. Colour one-half of the jelly with a few drops of\r\nprepared cochineal, and the other half leave as pale as possible. Have\r\nready a mould well wetted in every part; pour in a small quantity of the\r\nred jelly, and let this set; when quite firm, pour on it the same\r\nquantity of the pale jelly, and let this set; then proceed in this\r\nmanner until the mould is full, always taking care to let one jelly set\r\nbefore the other is poured in, or the colours would run one into the\r\nother. When turned out, the jelly should have a striped appearance. For\r\nvariety, half the mould may be filled at once with one of the jellies,\r\nand, when firm, filled up with the other: this, also, has a very pretty\r\neffect, and is more expeditiously prepared than when the jelly is poured\r\nin small quantities into the mould. Blancmange and red jelly, or\r\nblancmange and raspberry cream, moulded in the above manner, look very\r\nwell. The layers of blancmange and jelly should be about an inch in\r\ndepth, and each layer should be perfectly hardened before another is\r\nadded. Half a mould of blancmange and half a mould of jelly are\r\nfrequently served in the same manner. A few pretty dishes may be made,\r\nin this way, of jellies or blancmanges left from the preceding day, by\r\nmelting them separately in a jug placed in a saucepan of boiling water,\r\nand then moulding them by the foregoing directions. (See coloured plate\r\nS1.)\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour to make the jelly.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with calf's-feet jelly, 2s.; with gelatine and syrup,\r\nmore economical.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill 1-1/2 pint mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--In making the jelly, use for flavouring a very pale sherry, or\r\nthe colour will be too dark to contrast nicely with the red jelly.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON BLANCMANGE.\r\n\r\n1442. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of milk, the yolks of 4 eggs, 3 oz. of\r\nground rice, 6 oz. of pounded sugar, 1-1/2 oz. of fresh butter, the rind\r\nof 1 lemon, the juice of 2, 1/2 oz. of gelatine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLANCMANGE MOULD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a custard with the yolks of the eggs and 1/2 pint of the\r\nmilk, and, when done, put it into a basin: put half the remainder of the\r\nmilk into a saucepan with the ground rice, fresh butter, lemon-rind, and\r\n3 oz. of the sugar, and let these ingredients boil until the mixture is\r\nstiff, stirring them continually; when done, pour it into the bowl where\r\nthe custard is, mixing both well together. Put the gelatine with the\r\nrest of the milk into a saucepan, and let it stand by the side of the\r\nfire to dissolve; boil for a minute or two, stir carefully into the\r\nbasin, adding 3 oz. more of pounded sugar. When cold, stir in the\r\nlemon-juice, which should be carefully strained, and pour the mixture\r\ninto a well-oiled mould, leaving out the lemon-peel, and set the mould\r\nin a pan of cold water until wanted for table. Use eggs that have\r\nrich-looking yolks; and, should the weather be very warm, rather a\r\nlarger proportion of gelatine must be allowed.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill 2 small moulds. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON CREAM.\r\n\r\n1443. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of cream, the yolks of 2 eggs, 1/4 lb. of\r\nwhite sugar, 1 large lemon, 1 oz. of isinglass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEMON-CREAM MOULD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the cream into a _lined_ saucepan with the sugar,\r\nlemon-peel, and isinglass, and simmer these over a gentle fire for about\r\n10 minutes, stirring them all the time. Strain the cream into a jug, add\r\nthe yolks of eggs, which should be well beaten, and put the jug into a\r\nsaucepan of boiling water; stir the mixture one way until it thickens,\r\n_but do not allow it to boil_; take it off the fire, and keep stirring\r\nit until nearly cold. Strain the lemon-juice into a basin, gradually\r\npour on it the cream, and _stir it well_ until the juice is well mixed\r\nwith it. Have ready a well-oiled mould, pour the cream into it, and let\r\nit remain until perfectly set. When required for table, loosen the edges\r\nwith a small blunt knife, put a dish on the top of the mould, turn it\r\nover quickly, and the cream should easily slip away.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the cream; about 10 minutes to stir it over\r\nthe fire in the jug.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with cream at 1s. per pint, and the best isinglass, 2s.\r\n6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill 1-1/2-pint mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMICAL LEMON CREAM.\r\n\r\n1444. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of milk, 8 bitter almonds, 2 oz. of\r\ngelatine, 2 large lemons, 3/4 lb. of lump sugar, the yolks of 6 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk into a lined saucepan with the almonds, which\r\nshould be well pounded in a mortar, the gelatine, lemon-rind, and lump\r\nsugar, and boil these ingredients for about 5 minutes. Beat up the yolks\r\nof the eggs, strain the milk into a jug, add the eggs, and pour the\r\nmixture backwards and forwards a few times, until nearly cold; then stir\r\nbriskly to it the lemon-juice, which should be strained, and keep\r\nstirring until the cream is almost cold: put it into an oiled mould, and\r\nlet it remain until perfectly set. The lemon-juice must not be added to\r\nthe cream when it is warm, and should be well stirred after it is put\r\nin.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes to boil the milk. _Average cost_, 2s. 5d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill two 1-1/2-pint moulds. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON CREAMS.\r\n\r\n(_Very good_.)\r\n\r\n1445. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of cream, 2 dozen sweet almonds, 3 glasses of\r\nsherry, the rind and juice of 2 lemons, sugar to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Blanch and chop the almonds, and put them into a jug with the\r\ncream; in another jug put the sherry, lemon-rind, strained juice, and\r\nsufficient pounded sugar to sweeten the whole nicely. Pour rapidly from\r\none jug to the other till the mixture is well frothed; then, pour it\r\ninto jelly-glasses, omitting the lemon-rind. This is a very cool and\r\ndelicious sweet for summer, and may be made less rich by omitting the\r\nalmonds and substituting orange or raisin wine for the sherry.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with cream at 1s. per pint, 3s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill 12 glasses. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON CREAMS OF CUSTARDS.\r\n\r\n1446. INGREDIENTS.--5 oz. of loaf sugar, 2 pints of boiling water, the\r\nrind of 1 lemon and the juice of 3, the yolks of 8 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a quart of lemonade in the following manner:--Dissolve the\r\nsugar in the boiling water, having previously, with part of the sugar,\r\nrubbed off the lemon-rind, and add the strained juice. Strain the\r\nlemonade into a saucepan, and add the yolks of the eggs, which should be\r\nwell beaten; stir this _one way_ over the fire until the mixture\r\nthickens, but do not allow it to boil, and serve in custard-glasses, or\r\non a glass dish. After the boiling water is poured on the sugar and\r\nlemon, it should stand covered for about 1/2 hour before the eggs are\r\nadded to it, that the flavour of the rind may be extracted.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to make the lemonade; about 10 minutes to stir the\r\ncustard over the fire.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill 12 to 14 custard-glasses. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON JELLY.\r\n\r\n1447. INGREDIENTS.--6 lemons, 3/4 lb. of lump sugar, 1 pint of water,\r\n1-1/2 oz. of isinglass, 1/4 pint of sherry.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel 3 of the lemons, pour 1/2 pint of boiling water on the\r\nrind, and let it infuse for 1/2 hour; put the sugar, isinglass, and 1/2\r\npint of water into a lined saucepan, and boil these ingredients for 20\r\nminutes; then put in the strained lemon-juice, the strained infusion of\r\nthe rind, and bring the whole to the point of boiling; skim well, add\r\nthe wine, and run the jelly through a bag; pour it into a mould that has\r\nbeen wetted or soaked in water; put it in ice, if convenient, where let\r\nit remain until required for table. Previously to adding the lemon-juice\r\nto the other ingredients, ascertain that it is very nicely strained, as,\r\nif this is not properly attended to, it is liable to make the jelly\r\nthick and muddy. As this jelly is very pale, and almost colourless, it\r\nanswers very well for moulding with a jelly of any bright hue; for\r\ninstance, half a jelly bright red, and the other half made of the above,\r\nwould have a very good effect. Lemon jelly may also be made with\r\ncalf's-feet stock, allowing the juice of 3 lemons to every pint of\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with the best isinglass, 2s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill 1-1/2-pint mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON SPONGE.\r\n\r\n1448. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of isinglass, 1-3/4 pint of water, 3/4 lb. of\r\npounded sugar, the juice of 5 lemons, the rind of 1, the whites of 3\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Dissolve the isinglass in the water, strain it into a saucepan,\r\nand add the sugar, lemon-rind, and juice. Boil the whole from 10 to 15\r\nminutes; strain it again, and let it stand till it is cold and begins to\r\nstiffen. Beat the whites of the eggs, put them to it, and whisk the\r\nmixture till it is quite white; put it into a mould which has been\r\npreviously wetted, and let it remain until perfectly set; then turn it\r\nout, and garnish it according to taste.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes. _Average cost_, with the best isinglass, 3s.\r\n6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a quart mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIQUEUR JELLY.\r\n\r\n1449. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of lump sugar, 2 oz. of isinglass, 1-1/2 pint\r\nof water, the juice of 2 lemons, 1/4 pint of liqueur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVAL JELLY-MOULD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the sugar, with 1 pint of the water, into a stewpan, and\r\nboil them gently by the side of the fire until there is no scum\r\nremaining, which must be carefully removed as fast as it rises. Boil the\r\nisinglass with the other 1/2 pint of water, and skim it carefully in the\r\nsame manner. Strain the lemon-juice, and add it, with the clarified\r\nisinglass, to the syrup; put in the liqueur, and bring the whole to the\r\nboiling-point. Let the saucepan remain covered by the side of the fire\r\nfor a few minutes; then pour the jelly through a bag, put it into a\r\nmould, and set the mould in ice until required for table. Dip the mould\r\nin hot water, wipe the outside, loosen the jelly by passing a knife\r\nround the edges, and turn it out carefully on a dish. Noyeau,\r\nMaraschino, Curaçoa, brandy, or any kind of liqueur, answers for this\r\njelly; and, when made with isinglass, liqueur jellies are usually\r\nprepared as directed above.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the sugar and water.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with the best isinglass, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a quart mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SWEET DISH OF MACARONI.\r\n\r\n1450. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of macaroni, 1-1/2 pint of milk, the rind of\r\n1/2 lemon, 3 oz. of lump sugar, 3/4 pint of custard No. 1423.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk into a saucepan, with the lemon-peel and sugar;\r\nbring it to the boiling-point, drop in the macaroni, and let it\r\ngradually swell over a gentle fire, but do not allow the pipes to break.\r\nThe form should be entirely preserved; and, though tender, should be\r\nfirm, and not soft, with no part beginning to melt. Should the milk dry\r\naway before the macaroni is sufficiently swelled, add a little more.\r\nMake a custard by recipe No. 1423; place the macaroni on a dish, and\r\npour the custard over the hot macaroni; grate over it a little nutmeg,\r\nand, when cold, garnish the dish with slices of candied citron.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 40 to 50 minutes to swell the macaroni.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with the custard, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERINGUES.\r\n\r\n1451. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of pounded sugar, the whites of 4 eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MERINGUES.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and, with a\r\nwooden spoon, stir in _quickly_ the pounded sugar; and have some boards\r\nthick enough to put in the oven to prevent the bottom of the meringues\r\nfrom acquiring too much colour. Cut some strips of paper about 2 inches\r\nwide; place this paper on the board, and drop a tablespoonful at a time\r\nof the mixture on the paper, taking care to let all the meringues be the\r\nsame size. In dropping it from the spoon, give the mixture the form of\r\nan egg, and keep the meringues about 2 inches apart from each other on\r\nthe paper. Strew over them some sifted sugar, and bake in a moderate\r\noven for 1/2 hour. As soon as they begin to colour, remove them from the\r\noven; take each slip of paper by the two ends, and turn it gently on the\r\ntable, and, with a small spoon, take out the soft part of each meringue.\r\nSpread some clean paper on the board, turn the meringues upside down,\r\nand put them into the oven to harden and brown on the other side. When\r\nrequired for table, fill them with whipped cream, flavoured with liqueur\r\nor vanilla, and sweetened with pounded sugar. Join two of the meringues\r\ntogether, and pile them high in the dish, as shown in the annexed\r\ndrawing. To vary their appearance, finely-chopped almonds or currants\r\nmay be strewn over them before the sugar is sprinkled over; and they may\r\nbe garnished with any bright-coloured preserve. Great expedition is\r\nnecessary in making this sweet dish; as, if the meringues are not put\r\ninto the oven as soon as the sugar and eggs are mixed, the former melts,\r\nand the mixture would run on the paper, instead of keeping its\r\negg-shape. The sweeter the meringues are made, the crisper will they be;\r\nbut, if there is not sufficient sugar mixed with them, they will most\r\nlikely be tough. They are sometimes coloured with cochineal; and, if\r\nkept well covered in a dry place, will remain good for a month or six\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, about 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with the cream and flavouring, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 2 dozen meringues. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOYEAU CREAM.\r\n\r\n1452. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 oz. of isinglass, the juice of 2 lemons,\r\nnoyeau and pounded sugar to taste, 1-1/2 pint of cream.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Dissolve the isinglass in a little boiling water, add the\r\nlemon-juice, and strain this to the cream, putting in sufficient noyeau\r\nand sugar to flavour and sweeten the mixture nicely; whisk the cream\r\nwell, put it into an oiled mould, and set the mould in ice or in a cool\r\nplace; turn it out, and garnish the dish to taste.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with cream at 1s. per pint and the best isinglass, 4s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a quart mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPEN JELLY WITH WHIPPED CREAM.\r\n\r\n(_A very pretty dish_.)\r\n\r\n1453. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of jelly, 1/2 pint of cream, 1 glass of\r\nsherry, sugar to taste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OPEN JELLY WITH WHIPPED CREAM.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the above proportion of calf's-feet or isinglass jelly,\r\ncolouring and flavouring it in any way that may be preferred; soak a\r\nmould, open in the centre, for about 1/2 hour in cold water; fill it\r\nwith the jelly, and let it remain in a cool place until perfectly set;\r\nthen turn it out on a dish; fill the centre with whipped cream,\r\nflavoured with sherry and sweetened with pounded sugar; pile this cream\r\nhigh in the centre, and serve. The jelly should be made of rather a dark\r\ncolour, to contrast nicely with the cream.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill 1-1/2-pint mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE JELLY.\r\n\r\n1454. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of water, 1-1/2 to 2 oz. of isinglass, 1/2\r\nlb. of loaf sugar, 1 Seville orange, 1 lemon, about 9 China oranges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OPEN MOULD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the water into a saucepan, with the isinglass, sugar, and\r\nthe rind of 1 orange, and the same of 1/2 lemon, and stir these over the\r\nfire until the isinglass is dissolved, and remove the scum; then add to\r\nthis the juice of the Seville orange, the juice of the lemon, and\r\nsufficient juice of China oranges to make in all 1 pint; from 8 to 10\r\noranges will yield the desired quantity. Stir all together over the fire\r\nuntil it is just on the point of boiling; skim well; then strain the\r\njelly through a very fine sieve or jelly-bag, and when nearly cold, put\r\nit into a mould previously wetted, and, when quite set, turn it out on a\r\ndish, and garnish it to taste. To insure this jelly being clear, the\r\norange-and lemon-juice should be well strained, and the isinglass\r\nclarified, before they are added to the other ingredients, and, to\r\nheighten the colour, a few drops of prepared cochineal may be added.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes to boil without the juice; 1 minute after it is\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with the best isinglass, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a quart mould. _Seasonable_ from November to May.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE JELLY MOULDED WITH SLICES OF ORANGE.\r\n\r\n1455. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of orange jelly No. 1454, 4 oranges, 1\r\npint of clarified syrup.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil 1/2 lb. of loaf sugar with 1/2 pint of water until there\r\nis no scum left (which must be carefully removed as fast as it rises),\r\nand carefully peel the oranges; divide them into thin slices, without\r\nbreaking the thin skin, and put these pieces of orange into the syrup,\r\nwhere let them remain for about 5 minutes; then take them out, and use\r\nthe syrup for the jelly, which should be made by recipe No. 1454. When\r\nthe oranges are well drained, and the jelly is nearly cold, pour a\r\nlittle of the latter into the bottom of the mould; then lay in a few\r\npieces of orange; over these pour a little jelly, and when this is set,\r\nplace another layer of oranges, proceeding in this manner until the\r\nmould is full. Put it in ice, or in a cool place, and, before turning it\r\nout, wrap a cloth round the mould for a minute or two, which has been\r\nwrung out in boiling water.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes to simmer the oranges. _Average cost_, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_, with the slices of orange, to fill a quart mould.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to May.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE A PLAIN OMELET.\r\n\r\n1456. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 1 saltspoonful of salt, 1/3 saltspoonful of\r\npepper, 1/4 lb. of butter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OMELET.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Break the eggs into a basin, omitting the whites of 3, and beat\r\nthem up with the salt and pepper until extremely light; then add 2 oz.\r\nof the butter broken into small pieces, and stir this into the mixture.\r\nPut the other 2 oz. of butter into a frying-pan, make it quite hot, and,\r\nas soon as it begins to bubble, whisk the eggs, &c. very briskly for a\r\nminute or two, and pour them into the pan; stir the omelet with a spoon\r\none way until the mixture thickens and becomes firm, and when the whole\r\nis set, fold the edges over, so that the omelet assumes an oval form;\r\nand when it is nicely brown on one side, and quite firm, it is done. To\r\ntake off the rawness on the upper side, hold the pan before the fire for\r\na minute or two, and brown it with a salamander or hot shovel. Serve\r\nvery expeditiously on a very hot dish, and never cook it until it is\r\njust wanted. The flavour of this omelet may be very much enhanced by\r\nadding minced parsley, minced onion or eschalot, or grated cheese,\r\nallowing 1 tablespoonful of the former, and half the quantity of the\r\nlatter, to the above proportion of eggs. Shrimps or oysters may also be\r\nadded: the latter should be scalded in their liquor, and then bearded\r\nand cut into small pieces. In making an omelet, be particularly careful\r\nthat it is not too thin, and, to avoid this, do not make it in too large\r\na frying-pan, as the mixture would then spread too much, and taste of\r\nthe outside. It should also not be greasy, burnt, or too much done, and\r\nshould be cooked over a gentle fire, that the whole of the substance may\r\nbe heated without drying up the outside. Omelets are sometimes served\r\nwith gravy; but _this should never be poured over them_, but served in a\r\ntureen, as the liquid causes the omelet to become heavy and flat,\r\ninstead of eating light and soft. In making the gravy, the flavour\r\nshould not overpower that of the omelet, and should be thickened with\r\narrowroot or rice flour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--With 6 eggs, in a frying-pan 18 or 20 inches round, 4 to 6\r\nminutes. _Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\nHAM OMELET (_A delicious Breakfast Dish_.)\r\n\r\n1457. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 4 oz. of butter, 1/2 saltspoonful of pepper,\r\n2 tablespoonfuls of minced ham.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mince the ham very finely, without any fat, and fry it for 2\r\nminutes in a little butter; then make the batter for the omelet, stir in\r\nthe ham, and proceed as directed in recipe No. 1456. Do not add any salt\r\nto the batter, as the ham is usually sufficiently salt to impart a\r\nflavour to the omelet. Good lean bacon, or tongue, answers equally well\r\nfor this dish; but they must also be slightly cooked previously to\r\nmixing them with the batter. Serve very hot and quickly, without gravy.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 4 to 6 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIDNEY OMELET (_A favourite French dish_.)\r\n\r\n1458. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 1 saltspoonful of salt, 1/2 saltspoonful of\r\npepper, 2 sheep's kidneys, or 2 tablespoonfuls of minced veal kidney, 5\r\noz. of butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Skin the kidneys, cut them into small dice, and toss them in a\r\nfrying-pan, in 1 oz. of butter, over the fire for 2 or 3 minutes. Mix\r\nthe ingredients for the omelet the same as in recipe No. 1456, and when\r\nthe eggs are well whisked, stir in the pieces of kidney. Make the butter\r\nhot in the frying-pan, and when it bubbles, pour in the omelet, and fry\r\nit over a gentle fire from 4 to 6 minutes. When the eggs are set, fold\r\nthe edges over, so that the omelet assumes an oval form, and be careful\r\nthat it is not too much done: to brown the top, hold the pan before the\r\nfire for a minute or two, or use a salamander until the desired colour\r\nis obtained, but never turn an omelet in the pan. Slip it carefully on\r\nto a _very hot_ dish, or, what is a much safer method, put a dish on the\r\nomelet, and turn the pan quickly over. It should be served the instant\r\nit comes from the fire.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 to 6 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE A PLAIN SWEET OMELET.\r\n\r\n1459. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 4 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of sifted sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Break the eggs into a basin, omitting the whites of 3; whisk\r\nthem well, adding the sugar and 2 oz. of the butter, which should be\r\nbroken into small pieces, and stir all these ingredients well together.\r\nMake the remainder of the butter quite hot in a small frying-pan, and\r\nwhen it commences to bubble, pour in the eggs, &c. Keep stirring them\r\nuntil they begin to set; then turn the edges of the omelet over, to make\r\nit an oval shape, and finish cooking it. To brown the top, hold the pan\r\nbefore the fire, or use a salamander, and turn it carefully on to a\r\n_very hot_ dish: sprinkle sifted sugar over, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 4 to 6 minutes. _Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nOMELETTE AUX CONFITURES, or JAM OMELET.\r\n\r\n1460. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 4 oz. of butter, 3 tablespoonfuls of\r\napricot, strawberry, or any jam that may be preferred.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the omelet by recipe No. 1459, only instead of doubling it\r\nover, leave it flat in the pan. When quite firm, and nicely brown on one\r\nside, turn it carefully on to a hot dish, spread over the middle of it\r\nthe jam, and fold the omelet over on each side; sprinkle sifted sugar\r\nover, and serve very quickly. A pretty dish of small omelets may be made\r\nby dividing the batter into 3 or 4 portions, and frying them separately;\r\nthey should then be spread each one with a different kind of preserve,\r\nand the omelets rolled over. Always sprinkle sweet omelets with sifted\r\nsugar before being sent to table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 to 6 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nOMELETTE SOUFFLÉ.\r\n\r\n1461. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 5 oz. of pounded sugar, flavouring of\r\nvanilla, orange-flower water, or lemon-rind, 3 oz. of butter, 1\r\ndessert-spoonful of rice-flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs, add to the\r\nformer the sugar, the rice-flour, and either of the above flavourings\r\nthat may be preferred, and stir these ingredients well together. Whip\r\nthe whites of the eggs, mix them lightly with the batter, and put the\r\nbutter into a small frying-pan. As soon as it begins to bubble, pour the\r\nbatter into it, and set the pan over a bright but gentle fire; and when\r\nthe omelet is set, turn the edges over to make it an oval shape, and\r\nslip it on to a silver dish, which has been previously well buttered.\r\nPut it in the oven, and bake from 12 to 15 minutes; sprinkle\r\nfinely-powdered sugar over the soufflé, and _serve it immediately_.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 4 minutes in the pan; to bake, from 12 to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_. 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACHELOR'S OMELET.\r\n\r\n1462. INGREDIENTS.--2 or 3 eggs, 2 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of\r\nflour, 1/2 teacupful of milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a thin cream of the flour and milk; then beat up the eggs,\r\nmix all together, and add a pinch of salt and a few grains of cayenne.\r\nMelt the butter in a small frying-pan, and, when very hot, pour in the\r\nbatter. Let the pan remain for a few minutes over a clear fire; then\r\nsprinkle upon the omelet some chopped herbs and a few shreds of onion;\r\ndouble the omelet dexterously, and shake it out of the pan on to a hot\r\ndish. A simple sweet omelet can be made by the same process,\r\nsubstituting sugar or preserve for the chopped herbs.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE CREAM.\r\n\r\n1463. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of isinglass, 6 large oranges, 1 lemon, sugar\r\nto taste, water, 1/2 pint of good cream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OPEN MOULD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Squeeze the juice from the oranges and lemon; strain it, and\r\nput it into a saucepan with the isinglass, and sufficient water to make\r\nin all 1-1/2 pint. Rub the sugar on the orange and lemon-rind, add it to\r\nthe other ingredients, and boil all together for about 10 minutes.\r\nStrain through a muslin bag, and, when cold, beat up with it 1/2 pint of\r\nthick cream. Wet a mould, or soak it in cold water; pour in the cream,\r\nand put it in a cool place to set. If the weather is very cold, 1 oz. of\r\nisinglass will be found sufficient for the above proportion of\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the juice and water.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with the best isinglass, 3s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a quart mould.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to May.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE CREAMS.\r\n\r\n1464. INGREDIENTS.--1 Seville orange, 1 tablespoonful of brandy, 1/4 lb.\r\nof loaf sugar, the yolks of 4 eggs, 1 pint of cream.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the rind of the Seville orange until tender, and beat it\r\nin a mortar to a pulp; add to it the brandy, the strained juice of the\r\norange, and the sugar, and beat all together for about 10 minutes,\r\nadding the well-beaten yolks of eggs. Bring the cream to the\r\nboiling-point, and pour it very gradually to the other ingredients, and\r\nbeat the mixture till nearly cold; put it into custard-cups, place the\r\ncups in a deep dish of boiling water, where let them remain till quite\r\ncold. Take the cups out of the water, wipe them, and garnish the tops of\r\nthe creams with candied orange-peel or preserved chips.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 3/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with cream at 1s. per pint, 1s. 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 7 or 8 creams.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to May.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--To render this dish more economical, substitute milk for the\r\ncream, but add a small pinch of isinglass to make the creams firm.\r\n\r\n    SEVILLE ORANGE (_Citrus vulgaris_).--This variety, called also\r\n    _bitter orange_, is of the same species as the sweet orange, and\r\n    grows in great abundance on the banks of the Guadalquiver, in\r\n    Andalusia, whence this fruit is chiefly obtained. In that part\r\n    of Spain there are very extensive orchards of these oranges,\r\n    which form the chief wealth of the monasteries. The pulp of the\r\n    bitter orange is not eaten raw. In the yellow rind, separated\r\n    from the white spongy substance immediately below it, is\r\n    contained an essential oil, which is an agreeable warm aromatic,\r\n    much superior for many purposes to that of the common orange.\r\n    The best marmalade and the richest wine are made from this\r\n    orange; and from its flowers the best orange-flower water is\r\n    distilled. Seville oranges are also preserved whole as a\r\n    sweetmeat.\r\n\r\nORANGE FRITTERS.\r\n\r\n1465. INGREDIENTS.--For the batter, 1/2 lb. of flour, 1/2 oz. of butter,\r\n1/2 saltspoonful of salt, 2 eggs, milk, oranges, hot lard or clarified\r\ndripping.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a nice light batter with the above proportion of flour,\r\nbutter, salt, eggs, and sufficient milk to make it the proper\r\nconsistency; peel the oranges, remove as much of the white skin as\r\npossible, and divide each orange into eight pieces, without breaking the\r\nthin skin, unless it be to remove the pips; dip each piece of orange in\r\nthe batter. Have ready a pan of boiling lard or clarified dripping; drop\r\nin the oranges, and fry them a delicate brown from 8 to 10 minutes. When\r\ndone, lay them on a piece of blotting-paper before the fire, to drain\r\naway the greasy moisture, and dish them on a white d'oyley; sprinkle\r\nover them plenty of pounded sugar, and serve quickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--8 to 10 minutes to fry the fritters; 5 minutes to drain them.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to May.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRETTY DISH OF ORANGES.\r\n\r\n1466. INGREDIENTS.--6 large oranges, 1/2 lb. of loaf sugar, 1/4 pint of\r\nwater, 1/2 pint of cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of any kind of liqueur, sugar\r\nto taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the sugar and water into a saucepan, and boil them until\r\nthe sugar becomes brittle, which may be ascertained by taking up a small\r\nquantity in a spoon, and dipping it in cold water; if the sugar is\r\nsufficiently boiled, it will easily snap. Peel the oranges, remove as\r\nmuch of the white pith as possible, and divide them into nice-sized\r\nslices, without breaking the thin white skin which surrounds the juicy\r\npulp. Place the pieces of orange on small skewers, dip them into the hot\r\nsugar, and arrange them in layers round a plain mould, which should be\r\nwell oiled with the purest salad-oil. The sides of the mould only should\r\nbe lined with the oranges, and the centre left open for the cream. Let\r\nthe sugar become firm by cooling; turn the oranges carefully out on a\r\ndish, and fill the centre with whipped cream, flavoured with any kind of\r\nliqueur, and sweetened with pounded sugar. This is an exceedingly\r\nornamental and nice dish for the supper-table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the sugar. _Average cost_, 1s. 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 mould. _Seasonable_ from November to May.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE PANCAKES.\r\n\r\n1467. INGREDIENTS.--Eggs, flour, milk; to every egg allow 1 oz. of\r\nflour, about 1 gill of milk, 1/8 saltspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PANCAKES.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Ascertain that the eggs are fresh; break each one separately in\r\na cup; whisk them well, put them into a basin, with the flour, salt, and\r\na few drops of milk, and beat the whole to a perfectly _smooth_ batter;\r\nthen add by degrees the remainder of the milk. The proportion of this\r\nlatter ingredient must be regulated by the size of the eggs, &c. &c.;\r\nbut the batter, when ready for frying, should be of the consistency of\r\nthick cream. Place a small frying-pan on the fire to get hot; let it be\r\ndelicately clean, or the pancakes will stick, and, when quite hot, put\r\ninto it a small piece of butter, allowing about 1/2 oz. to each pancake.\r\nWhen it is melted, pour in the batter, about 1/2 teacupful to a pan 5\r\ninches in diameter, and fry it for about 4 minutes, or until it is\r\nnicely brown on one side. By only pouring in a small quantity of batter,\r\nand so making the pancakes thin, the necessity of turning them (an\r\noperation rather difficult to unskilful cooks) is obviated. When the\r\npancake is done, sprinkle over it some pounded sugar, roll it up in the\r\npan, and take it out with a large slice, and place it on a dish before\r\nthe fire. Proceed in this manner until sufficient are cooked for a dish;\r\nthen send them quickly to table, and continue to send in a further\r\nquantity, as pancakes are never good unless eaten almost immediately\r\nthey come from the frying-pan. The batter may be flavoured with a little\r\ngrated lemon-rind, or the pancakes may have preserve rolled in them\r\ninstead of sugar. Send sifted sugar and a cut lemon to table with them.\r\nTo render the pancakes very light, the yolks and whites of the eggs\r\nshould be beaten separately, and the whites added the last thing to the\r\nbatter before frying.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--from 4 to 6 minutes for a pancake that does not require\r\nturning; from 6 to 8 minutes for a thicker one.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for 3 persons, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient._--Allow 3 eggs, with the other ingredients in proportion,\r\nfor 3 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time, but specially served on Shrove Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHER PANCAKES.\r\n\r\n1468. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 1 pint of cream, 1/4 lb. of loaf sugar, 1\r\nglass of sherry, 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Ascertain that the eggs are extremely fresh, beat them well,\r\nstrain and mix with them the cream, pounded sugar, wine, nutmeg, and as\r\nmuch flour as will make the batter nearly as thick as that for ordinary\r\npancakes. Make the frying-pan hot, wipe it with a clean cloth, pour in\r\nsufficient batter to make a thin pancake, and fry it for about 5\r\nminutes. Dish the pancakes piled one above the other, strew sifted sugar\r\nbetween each, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with cream at 1s. per pint, 2s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 8 pancakes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time, but specially served on Shrove Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACH FRITTERS.\r\n\r\n1469. INGREDIENTS.--For the batter: 1/2 lb. of flour, 1/2 oz. of butter,\r\n1/2 saltspoonful of salt, 2 eggs, milk;--peaches, hot lard or clarified\r\ndripping.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a nice smooth, batter in the same manner as directed in\r\nrecipe No. 1393, and skin, halve, and stone the peaches, which should be\r\nquite ripe; dip them in the batter, and fry the pieces in hot lard or\r\nclarified dripping, which should be brought to the boiling-point before\r\nthe peaches are put in. From 8 to 10 minutes will be required to fry\r\nthem, and, when done, drain them before the fire, and dish them on a\r\nwhite d'oyley. Strew over plenty of pounded sugar, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 8 to 10 minutes to fry the fritters, 6 minutes to drain\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July, August, and September.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEACH.]\r\n\r\n    PEACH.--The peach and nectarine are amongst the most delicious\r\n    of our fruits, and are considered as varieties of the same\r\n    species produced by cultivation. The former is characterized by\r\n    a very delicate down, while the latter is smooth; but, as a\r\n    proof of their identity as to species, trees have borne peaches\r\n    in one part and nectarines in another; and even a single fruit\r\n    has had down on one side and the other smooth. The trees are\r\n    almost exactly alike, as well as the blossoms. Pliny states that\r\n    the peach was originally brought from Persia, where it grows\r\n    naturally, from which the name of Persica was bestowed upon it\r\n    by the Romans; and some modern botanists apply this as the\r\n    generic name, separating them from _Amygdalus_, or Almond, to\r\n    which Linnaeus had united them. Although they are not tropical,\r\n    they require a great deal of warmth to bring them to perfection:\r\n    hence they seldom ripen in this country, in ordinary seasons,\r\n    without the use of walls or glass; consequently, they bear a\r\n    high price. In a good peach, the flesh is firm, the skin thin,\r\n    of a deep bright colour next the sun and of a yellowish green\r\n    next to the wall; the pulp is yellowish, full of\r\n    highly-flavoured juice, the fleshy part thick, and the stone\r\n    small. Too much down is a sign of inferior quality. This fruit\r\n    is much used at the dessert, and makes a delicious preserve.\r\n\r\nPEARS A L'ALLEMANDE.\r\n\r\n1470. INGREDIENTS.--6 to 8 pears, water, sugar, 2 oz. of butter, the\r\nyolk of an egg, 1/2 oz. of gelatine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel and cut the pears into any form that may be preferred, and\r\nsteep them in cold water to prevent them turning black; put them into a\r\nsaucepan with sufficient cold water to cover them, and boil them with\r\nthe butter and enough sugar to sweeten them nicely, until tender; then\r\nbrush the pears over with the yolk of an egg, sprinkle them with sifted\r\nsugar, and arrange them on a dish. Add the gelatine to the syrup, boil\r\nit up quickly for about 5 minutes, strain it over the pears, and let it\r\nremain until set. The syrup may be coloured with a little prepared\r\ncochineal, which would very much improve the appearance of the dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 20 minutes to 1/2 hour to stew the pears; 5 minutes to\r\nboil the syrup.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a large dish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to February.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOULDED PEARS.\r\n\r\n1471. INGREDIENTS.--4 large pears or 6 small ones, 8 cloves, sugar to\r\ntaste, water, a small piece of cinnamon, 1/4 pint of raisin wine, a\r\nstrip of lemon-peel, the juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/2 oz. of gelatine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel and cut the pears into quarters; put them into a jar with\r\n3/4 pint of water, cloves, cinnamon, and sufficient sugar to sweeten the\r\nwhole nicely; cover down the top of the jar, and bake the pears in a\r\ngentle oven until perfectly tender, but do not allow them to break. When\r\ndone, lay the pears in a plain mould, which should be well wetted, and\r\nboil 1/2 pint of the liquor the pears were baked in with the wine,\r\nlemon-peel, strained juice, and gelatine. Let these ingredients boil\r\nquickly for 5 minutes, then strain the liquid warm over the pears; put\r\nthe mould in a cool place, and when the jelly is firm, turn it out on a\r\nglass dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours to bake the pears in a cool oven.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for a quart mould.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to February\r\n\r\n\r\nPINEAPPLE FRITTERS.\r\n\r\n(_An elegant Dish_.)\r\n\r\n1472. INGREDIENTS.--A small pineapple, a small wineglassful of brandy or\r\nliqueur, 2 oz. of sifted sugar; batter as for apple fritters No. 1393.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--This elegant dish, although it may appear extravagant, is\r\nreally not so if made when pineapples are plentiful. We receive them now\r\nin such large quantities from the West Indies, that at times they may be\r\npurchased at an exceedingly low rate: it would not, of course, be\r\neconomical to use the pines which are grown in our English pineries for\r\nthe purposes of fritters. Pare the pine with as little waste as\r\npossible, cut it into rather thin slices, and soak these slices in the\r\nabove proportion of brandy or liqueur and pounded sugar for 4 hours;\r\nthen make a batter the same as for apple fritters, substituting cream\r\nfor the milk, and using a smaller quantity of flour; and, when this is\r\nready, dip in the pieces of pine, and fry them in boiling lard from 5 to\r\n8 minutes; turn them when sufficiently brown on one side, and, when\r\ndone, drain them from the lard before the fire, dish them on a white\r\nd'oyley, strew over them sifted sugar, and serve quickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 to 8 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, when cheap and plentiful, 1s. 6d. for the pine.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July and August.\r\n\r\n    PINEAPPLE.--The pineapple has not been known in Europe above two\r\n    hundred years, and has not been cultivated in England much above\r\n    a century. It is stated that the first pineapples raised in\r\n    Europe were by M. La Cour, of Leyden, about the middle of the\r\n    17th century; and it is said to have been first cultivated in\r\n    England by Sir Matthew Decker, of Richmond. In Kensington\r\n    Palace, there is a picture in which Charles II. is represented\r\n    as receiving a pineapple from his gardener Rose, who is\r\n    presenting it on his knees.\r\n\r\nPLAIN FRITTERS.\r\n\r\n1473. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of flour, 3 eggs, 1/3 pint of milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAR FRITTER-MOULD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the flour to a smooth batter with a small quantity of the\r\nmilk; stir in the eggs, which should be well whisked, and then the\r\nremainder of the milk; boat the whole to a perfectly smooth batter, and\r\nshould it be found not quite thin enough, add two or three\r\ntablespoonfuls more milk. Have ready a frying-pan, with plenty of\r\nboiling lard in it; drop in rather more than a tablespoonful at a time\r\nof the batter, and fry the fritters a nice brown, turning them when\r\nsufficiently cooked on one side. Drain them well from the greasy\r\nmoisture by placing them upon a piece of blotting-paper before the\r\nfire; dish them on a white d'oyley, sprinkle over them sifted sugar, and\r\nsend to table with them a cut lemon and plenty of pounded sugar.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 6 to 8 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO FRITTERS.\r\n\r\n1474. INGREDIENTS.--2 large potatoes, 4 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream,\r\n2 ditto of raisin or sweet wine, 1 dessertspoonful of lemon-juice, 4\r\nteaspoonful of grated nutmeg, hot lard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCROLL FRITTER-MOULD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the potatoes, and beat them up lightly with a fork, but do\r\nnot use a spoon, as that would make them heavy. Beat the eggs well,\r\nleaving out one of the whites; add the other ingredients, and beat all\r\ntogether for at least 20 minutes, or until the batter is extremely\r\nlight. Put plenty of good lard into a frying-pan, and drop a\r\ntablespoonful of the batter at a time into it, and fry the fritters a\r\nnice brown. Serve them with the following sauce:--A glass of sherry\r\nmixed with the strained juice of a lemon, and sufficient white sugar to\r\nsweeten the whole nicely. Warm these ingredients, and serve the sauce\r\nseparately in a tureen. The fritters should be neatly dished on a white\r\nd'oyley, and pounded sugar sprinkled over them; and they should be well\r\ndrained on a piece of blotting-paper before the fire previously to being\r\ndished.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 6 to 8 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRASPBERRY CREAM.\r\n\r\n1475. INGREDIENTS.--3/4 pint of milk, 3/4 pint of cream, 1-1/2 oz. of\r\nisinglass, raspberry jelly, sugar to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of brandy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RASPBERRY CREAM MOULD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the milk, cream, and isinglass together for 1/4 hour, or\r\nuntil the latter is melted, and strain it through a hair sieve into a\r\nbasin. Let it cool a little; then add to it sufficient raspberry jelly,\r\nwhich, when melted, would make 1/3 pint, and stir well till the\r\ningredients are thoroughly mixed. If not sufficiently sweet, add a\r\nlittle pounded sugar with the brandy; whisk the mixture well until\r\nnearly cold, put it into a well-oiled mould, and set it in a cool place\r\ntill perfectly set. Raspberry jam may be substituted for the jelly, but\r\nmust be melted, and rubbed through a sieve, to free it from seeds: in\r\nsummer, the juice of the fresh fruit may be used, by slightly mashing it\r\nwith a wooden spoon, and sprinkling sugar over it; the juice that flows\r\nfrom the fruit should then be used for mixing with the cream. If the\r\ncolour should not be very good, a few drops of prepared cochineal may be\r\nadded to improve its appearance. (_See_ coloured plate T1.)\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to boil the cream and isinglass.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with cream at 1s. per pint, and the best isinglass, 3s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a quart mould.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_, with jelly, at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Strawberry cream may be made in precisely the same manner,\r\nsubstituting strawberry jam or jelly for the raspberry.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE BLANCMANGE.\r\n\r\n1476. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of ground rice, 3 oz. of loaf sugar, 1 oz.\r\nof fresh butter, 1 quart of milk, flavouring of lemon-peel, essence of\r\nalmonds or vanilla, or laurel-leaves.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the rice to a smooth batter with about 1/2 pint of the\r\nmilk, and the remainder put into a saucepan, with the sugar, butter, and\r\nwhichever of the above flavourings may be preferred; bring the milk to\r\nthe boiling-point, quickly stir in the rice, and let it boil for about\r\n10 minutes, or until it comes easily away from the saucepan, keeping it\r\nwell stirred the whole time. Grease a mould with pure salad-oil; pour in\r\nthe rice, and let it get perfectly set, when it should turn out quite\r\neasily; garnish it with jam, or pour round a compôte of any kind of\r\nfruit, just before it is sent to table. This blancmange is better for\r\nbeing made the day before it is wanted, as it then has time to become\r\nfirm. If laurel-leaves are used for flavouring, steep 3 of them in the\r\nmilk, and take them out before the rice is added: about 8 drops of\r\nessence of almonds, or from 12 to 16 drops of essence of vanilla, would\r\nbe required to flavour the above proportion of milk.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 10 to 15 minutes to boil the rice.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a quart mould.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE CROQUETTES.\r\n\r\n1477. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of rice, 1 quart of milk, 6 oz. of pounded\r\nsugar, flavouring of vanilla, lemon-peel, or bitter almonds, egg and\r\nbread crumbs, hot lard.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the rice, milk, and sugar into a saucepan, and let the\r\nformer gradually swell over a gentle fire until all the milk is dried\r\nup; and just before the rice is done, stir in a few drops of essence of\r\nany of the above flavourings. Let the rice get cold; then form it into\r\nsmall round balls, dip them into yolk of egg, sprinkle them with bread\r\ncrumbs, and fry them in boiling lard for about 10 minutes, turning them\r\nabout, that they may get equally browned. Drain the greasy moisture from\r\nthem, by placing them on a cloth in front of the fire for a minute or\r\ntwo; pile them on a white d'oyley, and send them quickly to table. A\r\nsmall piece of jam is sometimes introduced into the middle of each\r\ncroquette, which adds very much to the flavour of this favourite dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 3/4 to 1 hour to swell the rice; about 10 minutes to fry\r\nthe croquettes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 7 or 8 croquettes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE FRITTERS.\r\n\r\n1478. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of rice, 1 quart of milk, 3 oz. of sugar, 1\r\noz. of fresh butter 6 oz. of orange marmalade, 4 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Swell the rice in the milk, with the sugar and butter, over a\r\nslow fire until it is perfectly tender, which will be in about 3/4 hour.\r\nWhen the rice is done, strain away the milk, should there be any left,\r\nand mix with it the marmalade and well-beaten eggs; stir the whole over\r\nthe fire until the eggs are set; then spread the mixture on a dish to\r\nthe thickness of about 1/2 inch, or rather thicker. When it is perfectly\r\ncold, cut it into long strips, dip them in a batter the same as for\r\napple fritters, and fry them a nice brown. Dish them on a white d'oyley,\r\nstrew sifted sugar over, and serve quickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3/4 hour to swell the rice; from 7 to 10 minutes to fry\r\nthe fritters.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 7 or 8 fritters.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE SNOWBALLS. (_A pretty dish for Juvenile Suppers_.)\r\n\r\n1479. INGREDIENTS.--6 oz. of rice, 1 quart of milk, flavouring of\r\nessence of almonds, sugar to taste, 1 pint of custard made by recipe No.\r\n1423.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the rice in the milk, with sugar and a flavouring of\r\nessence of almonds, until the former is tender, adding, if necessary, a\r\nlittle more milk, should it dry away too much. When the rice is quite\r\nsoft, put it into teacups, or _small_ round jars, and let it remain\r\nuntil cold; then turn the rice out on a deep glass dish, pour over a\r\ncustard made by recipe No. 1423, and, on the top of each ball place a\r\nsmall piece of bright-coloured preserve or jelly. Lemon-peel or vanilla\r\nmay be boiled with the rice instead of the essence of almonds, when\r\neither of these is preferred; but the flavouring of the custard must\r\ncorrespond with that of the rice.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3/4 hour to swell the rice in the milk.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with the custard, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 children.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE SOUFFLE.\r\n\r\n1480. INGREDIENTS.--3 tablespoonfuls of ground rice, 1 pint of milk, 5\r\neggs, pounded sugar to taste, flavouring of lemon-rind, vanilla, coffee,\r\nchocolate, or anything that may be preferred, a piece of butter the size\r\nof a walnut.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the ground rice with 6 tablespoonfuls of the milk quite\r\nsmoothly, and put it into a saucepan with the remainder of the milk and\r\nbutter, and keep stirring it over the fire for about 1/4 hour, or until\r\nthe mixture thickens. Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs,\r\nbeat the former in a basin, and stir to them the rice and sufficient\r\npounded sugar to sweeten the soufflé; but add this latter ingredient as\r\nsparingly as possible, as, the less sugar there is used, the lighter\r\nwill be the soufflé. Now whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth\r\nor snow; mix them with the other preparation, and pour the whole into a\r\nsoufflé-dish, and put it instantly into the oven; bake it about 1/2 hour\r\nin a moderate oven; take it out, hold a salamander or hot shovel over\r\nthe top, sprinkle sifted sugar over it, and send the soufflé to table in\r\nthe dish it was baked in, either with a napkin pinned round, or inclosed\r\nin a more ornamental dish. The excellence of this fashionable dish\r\nentirely depends on the proper whisking of the whites of the eggs, the\r\nmanner of baking, and the expedition with which it is sent to table.\r\nSoufflés should be served _instantly_ from the oven, or they will sink,\r\nand be nothing more than an ordinary pudding.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE A SOUFFLE.\r\n\r\n1481. INGREDIENTS.--3 heaped tablespoonfuls of potato-flour, rice-flour,\r\narrowroot, or tapioca, 1 pint of milk, 5 eggs, a piece of butter\r\nthe size of a walnut, sifted sugar to taste, 1/4 saltspoonful of salt\r\nflavouring.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the potato-flour, or whichever one of the above ingredients\r\nis used, with a little of the milk; put it into a saucepan, with the\r\nremainder of the milk, the butter, salt, and sufficient pounded sugar to\r\nsweeten the whole nicely. Stir these ingredients over the fire until the\r\nmixture thickens; then take it off the fire, and let it cool a little.\r\nSeparate the whites from the yolks of the eggs, beat the latter, and\r\nstir them into the soufflé batter. Now whisk the whites of the eggs to\r\nthe firmest possible froth, for on this depends the excellence of the\r\ndish; stir them to the other ingredients, and add a few drops of essence\r\nof any flavouring that may be preferred; such as vanilla, lemon, orange,\r\nginger, &c. &c. Pour the batter into a soufflé-dish, put it immediately\r\ninto the oven, and bake for about 1/2 hour; then take it out, put the\r\ndish into another more ornamental one, such as is made for the purpose;\r\nhold a salamander or hot shovel over the soufflé, strew it with sifted\r\nsugar, and send it instantly to table. The secret of making a soufflé\r\nwell, is to have the eggs well whisked, but particularly the whites, the\r\noven not too hot, and to send it to table the moment it comes from the\r\noven. If the soufflé be ever so well made, and it is allowed to stand\r\nbefore being sent to table, its appearance and goodness will be entirely\r\nspoiled. Soufflés may be flavoured in various ways, but must be named\r\naccordingly. Vanilla is one of the most delicate and recherché\r\nflavourings that can be used for this very fashionable dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/2 hour in the oven; 2 or 3 minutes to hold the\r\nsalamander over.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOW EGGS, or OEUFS A LA NEIGE.\r\n\r\n(_A very pretty Supper Dish_.)\r\n\r\n1482. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 3/4 pint of milk, pounded sugar to taste,\r\nflavouring of vanilla, lemon-rind, or orange-flower water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk into a saucepan with sufficient sugar to sweeten\r\nit nicely, and the rind of 1/2 lemon. Let this steep by the side of the\r\nfire for 1/2 hour, when take out the peel; separate the whites from the\r\nyolks of the eggs, and whisk the former to a perfectly stiff froth, or\r\nuntil there is no liquid remaining; bring the milk to the boiling-point,\r\nand drop in the snow a tablespoonful at a time, and keep turning the\r\neggs until sufficiently cooked. Then place them on a glass dish, beat up\r\nthe yolks of the eggs, stir to them the milk, add a little more sugar,\r\nand strain this mixture into a jug; place the jug in a saucepan of\r\nboiling water, and stir it one way until the mixture thickens, but do\r\nnot allow it to boil, or it will curdle. Pour this custard over the\r\neggs, when they should rise to the surface. They make an exceedingly\r\npretty addition to a supper, and should be put in a cold place after\r\nbeing made. When they are flavoured with vanilla or orange-flower water,\r\nit is not necessary to steep the milk. A few drops of the essence of\r\neither may be poured in the milk just before the whites are poached. In\r\nmaking the custard, a little more flavouring and sugar should always be\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 2 minutes to poach the whites; 8 minutes to stir the\r\ncustard.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTONE CREAM OF TOUS LES MOIS.\r\n\r\n1483. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of preserve, 1 pint of milk, 2 oz. of lump\r\nsugar, 1 heaped tablespoonful of tous les mois, 3 drops of essence of\r\ncloves, 3 drops of almond-flavouring.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Place the preserve at the bottom of a glass dish; put the milk\r\ninto a lined saucepan, with the sugar, and make it boil. Mix to a smooth\r\nbatter the tous les mois, with a very little cold milk; stir it briskly\r\ninto the boiling milk, add the flavouring, and simmer for 2 minutes.\r\nWhen rather cool, but before turning solid, pour the cream over the jam,\r\nand ornament it with strips of red-currant jelly or preserved fruit.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 minutes. _Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRY JELLY.\r\n\r\n1484. INGREDIENTS.--Strawberries, pounded sugar; to every pint of juice\r\nallow 1-1/4 oz. of isinglass.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the strawberries, put them into a pan, squeeze them well\r\nwith a wooden spoon, add sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten them\r\nnicely, and let them remain for 1 hour, that the juice may be extracted;\r\nthen add 1/2 pint of water to every pint of juice. Strain the\r\nstrawberry-juice and water through a bag; measure it, and to every pint\r\nallow 1-1/4 oz. of isinglass, melted and clarified in 1/4 pint of water.\r\nMix this with the juice; put the jelly into a mould, and set the mould\r\nin ice. A little lemon-juice added to the strawberry-juice improves the\r\nflavour of the jelly, if the fruit is very ripe; but it must be well\r\nstrained before it is put to the other ingredients, or it will make the\r\njelly muddy.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour to draw the juice.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with the best isinglass, 3s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1-1/2 pint of jelly for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in June, July, and August.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWISS CREAM.\r\n\r\n1485. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of macaroons or 6 small sponge-cakes,\r\nsherry, 1 pint of cream, 5 oz. of lump sugar, 2 large tablespoonfuls of\r\narrowroot, the rind of 1 lemon, the juice of 1/2 lemon, 3 tablespoonfuls\r\nof milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Lay the macaroons or sponge-cakes in a glass dish, and pour\r\nover them as much sherry as will cover them, or sufficient to soak them\r\nwell. Put the cream into a lined saucepan, with the sugar and\r\nlemon-rind, and let it remain by the side of the fire until the cream is\r\nwell flavoured, when take out the lemon-rind. Mix the arrowroot smoothly\r\nwith the cold milk; add this to the cream, and let it boil gently for\r\nabout 3 minutes, keeping it well stirred. Take it off the fire, stir\r\ntill nearly cold, when add the lemon-juice, and pour the whole over the\r\ncakes. Garnish the cream with strips of angelica, or candied citron cut\r\nthin, or bright-coloured jelly or preserve. This cream is exceedingly\r\ndelicious, flavoured with vanilla instead of lemon: when this flavouring\r\nis used, the sherry may be omitted, and the mixture poured over the\r\n_dry_ cakes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/2 hour to infuse the lemon-rind; 5 minutes to boil the\r\ncream.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with cream at 1s. per pint, 3s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE SYLLABUB.\r\n\r\n1486. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of sherry or white wine, 1/2 grated nutmeg,\r\nsugar to taste, 1-1/2 pint of milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the wine into a bowl, with the grated nutmeg and plenty of\r\npounded sugar, and milk into it the above proportion of milk frothed up.\r\nClouted cream may be laid on the top, with pounded cinnamon or nutmeg\r\nand sugar; and a little brandy may be added to the wine before the milk\r\nis put in. In some counties, cider is substituted for the wine: when\r\nthis is used, brandy must always be added. Warm milk may be poured on\r\nfrom a spouted jug or teapot; but it must be held very high.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIPSY CAKE.\r\n\r\n1487. INGREDIENTS.--1 moulded sponge-or Savoy-cake, sufficient sweet\r\nwine or sherry to soak it, 6 tablespoonfuls of brandy, 2 oz. of sweet\r\nalmonds, 1 pint of rich custard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIPSY CAKE.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure a cake that is three or four days old,--either sponge,\r\nSavoy, or rice answering for the purpose of a tipsy cake. Cut the bottom\r\nof the cake level, to make it stand firm in the dish; make a small hole\r\nin the centre, and pour in and over the cake sufficient sweet wine or\r\nsherry, mixed with the above proportion of brandy, to soak it nicely.\r\nWhen the cake is well soaked, blanch and cut the almonds into strips,\r\nstick them all over the cake, and pour round it a good custard, made by\r\nrecipe No. 1423, allowing 8 eggs instead of 5 to the pint of milk. The\r\ncakes are sometimes crumbled and soaked, and a whipped cream heaped over\r\nthem, the same as for trifles.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 2 hours to soak the cake. _Average cost_, 4s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 dish. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    ALMOND.--The almond-tree is a native of warmer climates than\r\n    Britain, and is indigenous to the northern parts of Africa and\r\n    Asia; but it is now commonly cultivated in Italy, Spain, and the\r\n    south of France. It is not usually grown in Britain, and the\r\n    fruit seldom ripens in this country: it is much admired for the\r\n    beauty of its blossoms. In the form of its leaves and blossoms\r\n    it strongly resembles the peach-tree, and is included in the\r\n    same genus by botanists; but the fruit, instead of presenting a\r\n    delicious pulp like the peach, shrivels up as it ripens, and\r\n    becomes only a tough coriaceous covering to the stone inclosing\r\n    the eatable kernel, which is surrounded by a thin bitter skin.\r\n    It flowers early in the spring, and produces fruit in August.\r\n    There are two sorts of almonds,--sweet and bitter; but they are\r\n    considered to be only varieties of the species; and though the\r\n    qualities of the kernels are very different, they are not\r\n    distinguishable by their appearance.\r\n\r\nAN EASY WAY OF MAKING A TIPSY CAKE.\r\n\r\n1488. INGREDIENTS.--12 stale small sponge-cakes, raisin wine, 1/2 lb. of\r\njam, 1 pint of custard No. 1423.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Soak the sponge-cakes, which should be stale (on this account\r\nthey should be cheaper), in a little raisin wine; arrange them on a deep\r\nglass dish in four layers, putting a layer of jam between each, and pour\r\nround them a pint of custard, made by recipe No. 1423, decorating the\r\ntop with cut preserved fruit.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours to soak the cakes. Average cost, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 dish. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE A TRIFLE.\r\n\r\n1489. INGREDIENTS.--For the whip, 1 pint of cream, 3 oz. of pounded\r\nsugar, the whites of 2 eggs, a small glass of sherry or raisin wine. For\r\nthe trifle, 1 pint of custard, made with 8 eggs to a pint of milk; 6\r\nsmall sponge-cakes, or 6 slices of sponge-cake; 12 macaroons, 2 dozen\r\nratafias, 2 oz. of sweet almonds, the grated rind of 1 lemon, a layer of\r\nraspberry or strawberry jam, 1/2 pint of sherry or sweet wine, 6\r\ntablespoonfuls of brandy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRIFLE.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--The whip to lay over the top of the trifle should be made the\r\nday before it is required for table, as the flavour is better, and it is\r\nmuch more solid than when prepared the same day. Put into a large bowl\r\nthe pounded sugar, the whites of the eggs, which should be beaten to a\r\nstiff froth, a glass of sherry or sweet wine, and the cream. Whisk these\r\ningredients well in a cool place, and take off the froth with a skimmer\r\nas fast as it rises, and put it on a sieve to drain; continue the\r\nwhisking till there is sufficient of the whip, which must be put away in\r\na cool place to drain. The next day, place the sponge-cakes, macaroons,\r\nand ratafias at the bottom of a trifle-dish; pour over them 1/2 pint of\r\nsherry or sweet wine, mixed with 6 tablespoonfuls of brandy, and, should\r\nthis proportion of wine not be found quite sufficient, add a little\r\nmore, as the cakes should be well soaked. Over the cakes put the grated\r\nlemon-rind, the sweet almonds, blanched and cut into strips, and a layer\r\nof raspberry or strawberry jam. Make a good custard by recipe No. 1423,\r\nusing 8 instead of 5 eggs to the pint of milk, and let this cool a\r\nlittle; then pour it over the cakes, &c. The whip being made the day\r\npreviously, and the trifle prepared, there remains nothing to do now but\r\nheap the whip lightly over the top: this should stand as high as\r\npossible, and it may be garnished with strips of bright currant jelly,\r\ncrystallized sweetmeats, or flowers; the small coloured comfits are\r\nsometimes used for the purpose of garnishing a trifle, but they are now\r\nconsidered rather old-fashioned. (See coloured plate, V1.)\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with cream at 1s. per pint, 5s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 trifle. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANILLA CREAM.\r\n\r\n1490. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of milk, the yolks of 8 eggs, 6 oz. of sugar,\r\n1 oz. of isinglass, flavouring to taste of essence of vanilla.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VANILLA-CREAM MOULD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk and sugar into a saucepan, and let it get hot over\r\na slow fire; beat up the yolks of the eggs, to which add gradually the\r\nsweetened milk; flavour the whole with essence of vanilla, put the\r\nmixture into a jug, and place this jug in a saucepan of boiling water.\r\nStir the contents with a wooden spoon one way until the mixture\r\nthickens, but do not allow it to boil, or it will be full of lumps. Take\r\nit off the fire; stir in the isinglass, which should be previously\r\ndissolved in about 1/4 pint of water, and boiled for 2 or 3 minutes;\r\npour the cream into an oiled mould, put it in a cool place to set, and\r\nturn it out carefully on a dish. Instead of using the essence of\r\nvanilla, a pod may be boiled in the milk instead, until the flavour is\r\nwell extracted. A pod, or a pod and a half, will be found sufficient for\r\nthe above proportion of ingredients.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 10 minutes to stir the mixture.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with the best isinglass, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill a quart mould. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    VANILLE or VANILLA, is the fruit of the vanillier, a parasitical\r\n    herbaceous plant, which flourishes in Brazil, Mexico, and Peru.\r\n    The fruit is a long capsule, thick and fleshy. Certain species\r\n    of this fruit contain a pulp with a delicious perfume and\r\n    flavour. Vanilla is principally imported from Mexico. The\r\n    capsules for export are always picked at perfect maturity. The\r\n    essence is the form in which it is used generally and most\r\n    conveniently. Its properties are stimulating and exciting. It is\r\n    in daily use for ices, chocolates, and flavouring confections\r\n    generally.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA SANDWICHES.\r\n\r\n1491. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs; their weight in pounded sugar, butter, and\r\nflour; 1/4 saltspoonful of salt, a layer of any kind of jam or\r\nmarmalade.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat the butter to a cream; dredge in the flour and pounded\r\nsugar; stir these ingredients well together, and add the eggs, which\r\nshould be previously thoroughly whisked. When the mixture has been well\r\nbeaten for about 10 minutes, butter a Yorkshire-pudding tin, pour in the\r\nbatter, and bake it in a moderate oven for 20 minutes. Let it cool,\r\nspread one half of the cake with a layer of nice preserve, place over it\r\nthe other half of the cake, press the pieces slightly together, and then\r\ncut it into long finger-pieces; pile them in crossbars on a glass dish,\r\nand serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHIPPED CREAM, for putting on Trifles, serving in Glasses, &c.\r\n\r\n1492. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of cream allow 3 oz. of pounded sugar,\r\n1 glass of sherry or any kind of sweet white wine, the rind of 1/2\r\nlemon, the white of 1 egg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PASTRY LEAF.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the sugar on the lemon-rind, and pound it in a mortar until\r\nquite fine, and beat up the white of the egg until quite stiff; put the\r\ncream into a large bowl, with the sugar, wine, and beaten egg, and whip\r\nit to a froth; as fast as the froth rises, take it off with a skimmer,\r\nand put it on a sieve to drain, in a cool place. This should be made the\r\nday before it is wanted, as the whip is then so much firmer. The cream\r\nshould be whipped in a cool place, and in summer, over ice, if it is\r\nobtainable. A plain whipped cream may be served on a glass dish, and\r\ngarnished with strips of angelica, or pastry leaves, or pieces of\r\nbright-coloured jelly: it makes a very pretty addition to the\r\nsupper-table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1 hour to whip the cream.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with cream at 1s. per pint, 1s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 dish or 1 trifle.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHIPPED SYLLABUBS.\r\n\r\n1493. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of cream, 1/4 pint of sherry, half that\r\nquantity of brandy, the juice of 1/2 lemon, a little grated nutmeg, 3\r\noz. of pounded sugar, whipped cream the same as for trifle No. 1489.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix all the ingredients together, put the syllabub into\r\nglasses, and over the top of them heap a little whipped cream, made in\r\nthe same manner as for trifle No. 1489. Solid syllabub is made by\r\nwhisking or milling the mixture to a stiff froth, and putting it in the\r\nglasses, without the whipped cream at the top.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill 8 or 9 glasses.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURE'S OMELET.\r\n\r\n\"Every one knows,\" says Brillat Savarin, in his \"Physiology of Taste,\"\r\n\"that for twenty years Madame Récamier was the most beautiful woman in\r\nParis. It is also well known that she was exceedingly charitable, and\r\ntook a great interest in every benevolent work. Wishing to consult the\r\nCuré of ---- respecting the working of an institution, she went to his\r\nhouse at five o'clock in the afternoon, and was much astonished at\r\nfinding him already at his dinner-table.\r\n\r\n\"Madame Récamier wished to retire, but the Curé would not hear of it. A\r\nneat white cloth covered the table; some good old wine sparkled in a\r\ncrystal decanter; the porcelain was of the best; the plates had heaters\r\nof boiling water beneath them; a neatly-costumed maid-servant was in\r\nattendance. The repast was a compromise between frugality and luxury.\r\nThe crawfish-soup had just been removed, and there was on the table a\r\nsalmon-trout, an omelet, and a salad.\r\n\r\n\"'My dinner will tell you,' said the worthy Curé, with a smile, 'that it\r\nis fast-day, according to our Church's regulations.' Madame Récamier and\r\nher host attacked the trout, the sauce served with which betrayed a\r\nskilful hand, the countenance of the Curé the while showing\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"And now they fell upon the omelet, which was round, sufficiently thick,\r\nand cooked, so to speak, to a hair's-breadth.\r\n\r\n\"As the spoon entered the omelet, a thick rich juice issued from it,\r\npleasant to the eye as well as to the smell; the dish became full of it;\r\nand our fair friend owns that, between the perfume and the sight, it\r\nmade her mouth water.\r\n\r\n\"'It is an _omelette au thon_' (that is to say, a tunny omelet), said\r\nthe Curé, noticing, with the greatest delight, the emotion of Madame\r\nRécamier, 'and few people taste it without lavishing praises on it.'\r\n\r\n\"'It surprises me not at all,' returned the beauty; 'never has so\r\nenticing an omelet met my gaze at any of our lay tables.'\r\n\r\n\"'My cook understands them well, I think.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' added Madame, 'I never ate anything so delightful.'\"\r\n\r\nThen came the salad, which Savarin recommends to all who place\r\nconfidence in him. It refreshes without exciting; and he has a theory\r\nthat it makes people younger.\r\n\r\nAmidst pleasant converse the dessert arrived. It consisted of three\r\napples, cheese, and a plate of preserves; and then upon a little round\r\ntable was served the Mocha coffee, for which France has been, and is, so\r\njustly famous.\r\n\r\n\"'I never,' said the Curé, 'take spirits; I always offer liqueurs to my\r\nguests but reserve the use of them, myself, to my old age, if it should\r\nplease Providence to grant me that.'\r\n\r\n\"Finally, the charming Madame Récamier took her leave, and told all her\r\nfriends of the delicious omelet which she had seen and partaken of.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Brillat Savarin, in his capacity as the Layard of the concealed\r\ntreasures of Gastronomia, has succeeded in withdrawing from obscurity\r\nthe details of the preparation of which so much had been said, and which\r\nhe imagines to be as wholesome as it was agreeable.\r\n\r\nHere follows the recipe:--\r\n\r\nOMELETTE AU THON.\r\n\r\n1494. Take, for 6 persons, the roes of 2 carp; [Footnote: An American\r\nwriter says he has followed this recipe, substituting pike, shad, &c.,\r\nin the place of carp, and can recommend all these also, with a quiet\r\nconscience. Any fish, indeed, may be used with success.] bleach them, by\r\nputting them, for 5 minutes, in boiling water slightly salted. Take a\r\npiece of fresh tunny about the size of a hen's egg, to which add a small\r\nshalot already chopped; hash up together the roe and the tunny, so as to\r\nmix them well, and throw the whole into a saucepan, with a sufficient\r\nquantity of very good butter: whip it up until the butter is melted!\r\nThis constitutes the specialty of the omelet. Take a second piece of\r\nbutter, _à discrétion_, mix it with parsley and herbs, place it in a\r\nlong-shaped dish destined to receive the omelet; squeeze the juice of a\r\nlemon over it, and place it on hot embers. Beat up 12 eggs (the fresher\r\nthe better); throw up the sauté of roe and tunny, stirring it so as to\r\nmix all well together; then make your omelet in the usual manner,\r\nendeavouring to turn it out long, thick, and soft. Spread it carefully\r\non the dish prepared for it, and serve at once. This dish ought to be\r\nreserved for recherché déjeûners, or for assemblies where amateurs meet\r\nwho know how to eat well; washed down with a good old wine, it will work\r\nwonders.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The roe and the tunny must be beaten up (sauté) without\r\nallowing them to boil, to prevent their hardening, which would prevent\r\nthem mixing well with the eggs. Your dish should be hollowed towards the\r\ncentre, to allow the gravy to concentrate, that it may be helped with a\r\nspoon. The dish ought to be slightly heated, otherwise the cold china\r\nwill extract all the heat from the omelet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ICES, AND DESSERT\r\nDISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVES.\r\n\r\n1495. From the nature of vegetable substances, and chiefly from their\r\nnot passing so rapidly into the putrescent state as animal bodies, the\r\nmode of preserving them is somewhat different, although the general\r\nprinciples are the same. All the means of preservation are put in\r\npractice occasionally for fruits and the various parts of vegetables,\r\naccording to the nature of the species, the climate, the uses to which\r\nthey are applied, &c. Some are dried, as nuts, raisins, sweet herbs,\r\n&c.; others are preserved by means of sugar, such as many fruits whose\r\ndelicate juices would be lost by drying; some are preserved by means of\r\nvinegar, and chiefly used as condiments or pickles; a few also by\r\nsalting, as French beans; while others are preserved in spirits. We\r\nhave, however, in this place to treat of the best methods of preserving\r\nfruits. Fruit is a most important item in the economy of health; the\r\nepicurean can scarcely be said to have any luxuries without it;\r\ntherefore, as it is so invaluable, when we cannot have it fresh, we must\r\nhave it preserved. It has long been a desideratum to preserve fruits by\r\nsome cheap method, yet by such as would keep them fit for the various\r\nculinary purposes, as making tarts and other similar dishes. The expense\r\nof preserving them with sugar is a serious objection; for, except the\r\nsugar is used in considerable quantities, the success is very uncertain.\r\nSugar also overpowers and destroys the sub-acid taste so desirable in\r\nmany fruits: these which are preserved in this manner are chiefly\r\nintended for the dessert. Fruits intended for preservation should be\r\ngathered in the morning, in dry weather, with the morning sun upon them,\r\nif possible; they will then have their fullest flavour, and keep in good\r\ncondition longer than when gathered at any other time. Until fruit can\r\nbe used, it should be placed in the dairy, an ice-house, or a\r\nrefrigerator. In an icehouse it will remain fresh and plump for several\r\ndays. Fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be mildewed, and\r\nbe of no service for preserves.\r\n\r\n1496. Having secured the first and most important contribution to the\r\nmanufacture of preserves,--the fruit, the next consideration is the\r\npreparation of the syrup in which the fruit is to be suspended; and this\r\nrequires much care. In the confectioner's art there is a great nicety in\r\nproportioning the degree of concentration of the syrup very exactly to\r\neach particular case; and they know this by signs, and express it by\r\ncertain technical terms. But to distinguish these properly requires very\r\ngreat attention and considerable experience. The principal thing to be\r\nacquainted with is the fact, that, in proportion as the syrup is longer\r\nboiled, its water will become evaporated, and its consistency will be\r\nthicker. Great care must be taken in the management of the fire, that\r\nthe syrup does not boil over, and that the boiling is not carried to\r\nsuch an extent as to burn the sugar.\r\n\r\n1497. The first degree of consistency is called _the thread_, which is\r\nsubdivided into the little and great thread. If you dip the finger into\r\nthe syrup and apply it to the thumb, the tenacity of the syrup will, on\r\nseparating the finger and thumb, afford a thread, which shortly breaks:\r\nthis is the little thread. If the thread, from the greater tenacity,\r\nand, consequently, greater strength of the syrup, admits of a greater\r\nextension of the finger and thumb, it is called the great thread. There\r\nare half a dozen other terms and experiments for testing the various\r\nthickness of the boiling sugar towards the consistency called _caramel_;\r\nbut that degree of sugar-boiling belongs to the confectioner. A solution\r\nof sugar prepared by dissolving two parts of double-refined sugar (the\r\nbest sugar is the most economical for preserves) in one of water, and\r\nboiling this a little, affords a syrup of the right degree of strength,\r\nand which neither ferments nor crystallizes. This appears to be the\r\ndegree called _smooth_ by the confectioners, and is proper to be used\r\nfor the purposes of preserves. The syrup employed should sometimes be\r\nclarified, which is done in the following manner:--Dissolve 2 lbs. of\r\nloaf sugar in a pint of water; add to this solution the white of an egg,\r\nand beat it well. Put the preserving-pan upon the fire with the\r\nsolution; stir it with a wooden spatula, and, when it begins to swell\r\nand boil up, throw in some cold water or a little oil, to damp the\r\nboiling; for, as it rises suddenly, if it should boil over, it would\r\ntake fire, being of a very inflammable nature. Let it boil up again;\r\nthen take it off, and remove carefully the scum that has risen. Boil the\r\nsolution again, throw in a little more cold water, remove the scum, and\r\nso on for three or four times successively; then strain it. It is\r\nconsidered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours\r\nout like oil.\r\n\r\n1498. Although sugar passes so easily into the state of fermentation,\r\nand is, in fact, the only substance capable of undergoing the vinous\r\nstage of that process, yet it will not ferment at all if the quantity be\r\nsufficient to constitute a very strong syrup: hence, syrups are used to\r\npreserve fruits and other vegetable substances from the changes they\r\nwould undergo if left to themselves. Before sugar was in use, honey was\r\nemployed to preserve many vegetable productions, though this substance\r\nhas now given way to the juice of the sugar-cane.\r\n\r\n1499. The fruits that are the most fit for preservation in syrup are,\r\napricots, peaches, nectarines, apples, greengages, plums of all kinds,\r\nand pears. As an example, take some apricots not too ripe, make a small\r\nslit at the stem end, and push out the stone; simmer them in water till\r\nthey are softened and about half done, and afterwards throw them into\r\ncold water. When they have cooled, take them out and drain them. Put the\r\napricots into the pie-serving-pan with sufficient syrup to cover them;\r\nlet them boil up three or four times, and then skim them; remove them\r\nfrom the fire, pour them into an earthen pan, and let them cool till\r\nnext day. Boil them up three days successively, skimming each time, and\r\nthey will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for\r\nuse. After each bailing, it is proper to examine into the state of the\r\nsyrup when cold; if too thin, it will bear additional boiling; if too\r\nthick, it may be lowered with more syrup of the usual standard. The\r\nreason why the fruit is emptied out of the preserving-pan into an\r\nearthen pan is, that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper, of\r\nwhich the preserving-pans are usually made. From this example the\r\nprocess of preserving fruits by syrup will be easily comprehended. The\r\nfirst object is to soften the fruit by blanching or boiling it in water,\r\nin order that the syrup by which it is preserved may penetrate through\r\nits substance.\r\n\r\n1500. Many fruits, when preserved by boiling, lose much of their\r\npeculiar and delicate flavour, as, for instance, pine-apples; and this\r\ninconvenience may, in some instances, be remedied by preserving them\r\nwithout heat. Cut the fruit in slices about one fifth of an inch thick,\r\nstrew powdered loaf sugar an eighth of an inch thick on the bottom of a\r\njar, and put the slices on it. Put more sugar on this, and then another\r\nlayer of the slices, and so on till the jar is full. Place the jar with\r\nthe fruit up to the neck in boiling water, and keep it there till the\r\nsugar is completely dissolved, which may take half an hour, removing the\r\nscum as it rises. Lastly, tie a wet bladder over the mouth of the jar,\r\nor cork and wax it.\r\n\r\n1501. Any of the fruits that have been preserved in syrup may be\r\nconverted into dry preserves, by first draining them from the syrup, and\r\nthen drying them in a stove or very moderate oven, adding to them a\r\nquantity of powdered loaf sugar, which will gradually penetrate the\r\nfruit, while the fluid parts of the syrup gently evaporate. They should\r\nbe dried in the stove or oven on a sieve, and turned every six or eight\r\nhours, fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they are\r\nturned. Afterwards, they are to be kept in a dry situation, in drawers\r\nor boxes. Currants and cherries preserved whole in this manner, in\r\nbunches, are extremely elegant, and have a fine flavour. In this way it\r\nis, also, that orange and lemon chips are preserved.\r\n\r\n1502. Marmalades, jams, and fruit pastes are of the same nature, and are\r\nnow in very general request. They are prepared without difficulty, by\r\nattending to a very few directions; they are somewhat expensive, but may\r\nbe kept without spoiling for a considerable time. Marmalades and jams\r\ndiffer little from each other: they are preserves of a half-liquid\r\nconsistency, made by boiling the pulp of fruits, and sometimes part of\r\nthe rinds, with sugar. The appellation of marmalade is applied to those\r\nconfitures which are composed of the firmer fruits, as pineapples or the\r\nrinds of oranges; whereas jams are made of the more juicy berries, such\r\nas strawberries, raspberries, currants, mulberries, &c. Fruit pastes are\r\na kind of marmalades, consisting of the pulp of fruits, first evaporated\r\nto a proper consistency, and afterwards boiled with sugar. The mixture\r\nis then poured into a mould, or spread on sheets of tin, and\r\nsubsequently dried in the oven or stove till it has acquired the state\r\nof a paste. From a sheet of this paste, strips may be cut and formed\r\ninto any shape that may be desired, as knots, rings, &c. Jams require\r\nthe same care and attention in the boiling as marmalade; the slightest\r\ndegree of burning communicates a disagreeable empyreumatic taste, and if\r\nthey are not boiled sufficiently, they will not keep. That they may\r\nkeep, it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar.\r\n\r\n1503. In all the operations for preserve-making, when the preserving-pan\r\nis used, it should not be placed on the fire, but on a trivet, unless\r\nthe jam is made on a hot plate, when this is not necessary. If the pan\r\nis placed close on to the fire, the preserve is very liable to burn, and\r\nthe colour and flavour be consequently spoiled.\r\n\r\n1504. Fruit jellies are compounds of the juices of fruits combined with\r\nsugar, concentrated, by boiling, to such a consistency that the liquid,\r\nupon cooling, assumes the form of a tremulous jelly.\r\n\r\n1505. Before fruits are candied, they must first be boiled in syrup,\r\nafter which they are taken out and dried on a stove, or before the fire;\r\nthe syrup is then to be concentrated, or boiled to a candy height, and\r\nthe fruit dipped in it, and again laid on the stove to dry and candy:\r\nthey are then to be put into boxes, and kept dry.\r\n\r\n1506. Conserves consist of fresh vegetable matters beat into a uniform\r\nmass with refined sugar, and they are intended to preserve the virtues\r\nand properties of recent flowers, leaves, roots, peels, or fruits,\r\nunaltered, and as near as possible to what they were when fresh\r\ngathered, and to give them an agreeable taste.\r\n\r\n1507. The last-mentioned, but not the least-important preparation of\r\nfruit, is the _compôte,_ a confiture made at the moment of need, and\r\nwith much less sugar than would be ordinarily put to preserves. They are\r\nmost wholesome things, suitable to most stomachs which cannot\r\naccommodate themselves to raw fruit or a large portion of sugar: they\r\nare the happy medium, and far better than ordinary stewed fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFECTIONARY.\r\n\r\n1508. In speaking of confectionary, it should be remarked that all the\r\nvarious preparations above named come, strictly speaking, under that\r\nhead; for the various fruits, flowers, herbs, roots, and juices, which,\r\nwhen boiled with sugar, were formerly employed in pharmacy as well as\r\nfor sweetmeats, were called _confections_, from the Latin word\r\n_conficere_, 'to make up;' but the term confectionary embraces a very\r\nlarge class indeed of sweet food, many kinds of which should not be\r\nattempted in the ordinary cuisine. The thousand and one ornamental\r\ndishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the\r\nconfectioner: they cannot profitably be made at home. Apart from these,\r\ncakes, biscuits, and tarts, &c., the class of sweetmeats called\r\nconfections may be thus classified:--1. Liquid confects, or fruits\r\neither whole or in pieces, preserved by being immersed in a fluid\r\ntransparent syrup; as the liquid confects of apricots, green citrons,\r\nand many foreign fruits. 2. Dry confects are those which, after having\r\nbeen boiled in the syrup, are taken out and put to dry in an oven, as\r\ncitron and orange-peel, &c. 3. Marmalade, jams, and pastes, a kind of\r\nsoft compounds made of the pulp of fruits or other vegetable substances,\r\nbeat up with sugar or honey; such as oranges, apricots, pears, &c. 4.\r\nJellies are the juices of fruits boiled with sugar to a pretty thick\r\nconsistency, so as, upon cooling, to form a trembling jelly; as currant,\r\ngooseberry, apple jelly, &c. 5. Conserves are a kind of dry confects,\r\nmade by beating up flowers, fruits, &c., with sugar, not dissolved. 6.\r\nCandies are fruits candied over with sugar after having been boiled in\r\nthe syrup.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESSERT DISHES.\r\n\r\n1509. With moderns the dessert is not so profuse, nor does it hold the\r\nsame relationship to the dinner that it held with the ancients,--the\r\nRomans more especially. On ivory tables they would spread hundreds of\r\ndifferent kinds of raw, cooked, and preserved fruits, tarts and cakes,\r\nas substitutes for the more substantial comestibles with which the\r\nguests were satiated. However, as late as the reigns of our two last\r\nGeorges, fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts. The\r\ndessert certainly repays, in its general effect, the expenditure upon it\r\nof much pains; and it may be said, that if there be any poetry at all in\r\nmeals, or the process of feeding, there is poetry in the dessert, the\r\nmaterials for which should be selected with taste, and, of course, must\r\ndepend, in a great measure, upon the season. Pines, melons, grapes,\r\npeaches, nectarines, plums, strawberries, apples, pears, oranges,\r\nalmonds, raisins, figs, walnuts, filberts, medlars, cherries, &c. &c.,\r\nall kinds of dried fruits, and choice and delicately-flavoured cakes and\r\nbiscuits, make up the dessert, together with the most costly and\r\n_recherché_ wines. The shape of the dishes varies at different periods,\r\nthe prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on\r\nstems. The patterns and colours are also subject to changes of fashion;\r\nsome persons selecting china, chaste in pattern and colour; others,\r\nelegantly-shaped glass dishes on stems, with gilt edges. The beauty of\r\nthe dessert services at the tables of the wealthy tends to enhance the\r\nsplendour of the plate. The general mode of putting a dessert on table,\r\nnow the elegant tazzas are fashionable, is, to place them down the\r\nmiddle of the table, a tall and short dish alternately; the fresh fruits\r\nbeing arranged on the tall dishes, and dried fruits, bon-bons, &c., on\r\nsmall round or oval glass plates. The garnishing needs especial\r\nattention, as the contrast of the brilliant-coloured fruits with\r\nnicely-arranged foliage is very charming. The garnish _par excellence_\r\nfor dessert is the ice-plant; its crystallized dewdrops producing a\r\nmarvellous effect in the height of summer, giving a most inviting sense\r\nof coolness to the fruit it encircles. The double-edged mallow,\r\nstrawberry, and vine leaves have a pleasing effect; and for winter\r\ndesserts, the bay, cuba, and laurel are sometimes used. In town, the\r\nexpense and difficulty of obtaining natural foliage is great, but paper\r\nand composite leaves are to be purchased at an almost nominal price.\r\nMixed fruits of the larger sort are now frequently served on one dish.\r\nThis mode admits of the display of much taste in the arrangement of the\r\nfruit: for instance, a pine in the centre of the dish, surrounded with\r\nlarge plums of various sorts and colours, mixed with pears, rosy-cheeked\r\napples, all arranged with a due regard to colour, have a very good\r\neffect. Again, apples and pears look well mingled with plums and grapes,\r\nhanging from the border of the dish in a _négligé_ sort of manner, with\r\na large bunch of the same fruit lying on the top of the apples. A\r\ndessert would not now be considered complete without candied and\r\npreserved fruits and confections. The candied fruits may be purchased at\r\na less cost than they can be manufactured at home. They are preserved\r\nabroad in most ornamental and elegant forms. And since, from the\r\nfacilities of travel, we have become so familiar with the tables of the\r\nFrench, chocolate in different forms is indispensable to our desserts.\r\n\r\n\r\nICES.\r\n\r\n510. Ices are composed, it is scarcely necessary to say, of congealed\r\ncream or water, combined sometimes with liqueurs or other flavouring\r\ningredients, or more generally with the juices of fruits. At desserts,\r\nor at some evening parties, ices are scarcely to be dispensed with. The\r\nprincipal utensils required for making ice-creams are ice-tubs,\r\nfreezing-pots, spaddles, and a cellaret. The tub must be large enough to\r\ncontain about a bushel of ice, pounded small, when brought out of the\r\nice-house, and mixed very carefully with either _salt, nitre,_ or\r\n_soda._ The freezing-pot is best made of pewter. If it be of tin, as is\r\nsometimes the case, the congelation goes on too rapidly in it for the\r\nthorough intermingling of its contents, on which the excellence of the\r\nice greatly depends. The spaddle is generally made of copper, kept\r\nbright and clean. The cellaret is a tin vessel, in which ices are kept\r\nfor a short time from dissolving. The method to be pursued in the\r\nfreezing process must be attended to. When the ice-tub is prepared with\r\nfresh-pounded ice and salt, the freezing-pot is put into it up to its\r\ncover. The articles to be congealed are then poured into it and covered\r\nover; but to prevent the ingredients from separating and the heaviest of\r\nthem from falling to the bottom of the mould, it is requisite to turn\r\nthe freezing-pot round and round by the handle, so as to keep its\r\ncontents moving until the congelation commences. As soon as this is\r\nperceived (the cover of the pot being occasionally taken off for the\r\npurpose of noticing when freezing takes place), the cover is immediately\r\nclosed over it, ice is put upon it, and it is left in this state till it\r\nis served. The use of the spaddle is to stir up and remove from the\r\nsides of the freezing pot the cream, which in the shaking may have\r\nwashed against it, and by stirring it in with the rest, to prevent waste\r\nof it occurring. Any negligence in stirring the contents of the\r\nfreezing-pot before congelation takes place, will destroy the whole:\r\neither the sugar sinks to the bottom and leaves the ice insufficiently\r\nsweetened, or lumps are formed, which disfigure and discolour it.\r\n\r\n1511. The aged, the delicate, and children should abstain from ices or\r\niced beverages; even the strong and healthy should partake of them in\r\nmoderation. They should be taken immediately after the repast, or some\r\nhours after, because the taking these substances _during_ the process of\r\ndigestion is apt to provoke indisposition. It is necessary, then, that\r\nthis function should have scarcely commenced, or that it should be\r\ncompletely finished, before partaking of ices. It is also necessary to\r\nabstain from them when persons are very warm, or immediately after\r\ntaking violent exercise, as in some cases they have produced illnesses\r\nwhich have ended fatally.\r\n\r\n[Do ladies know to whom they are indebted for the introduction of ices,\r\nwhich all the fair sex are passionately fond of?--To Catherine de'\r\nMedici. Will not this fact cover a multitude of sins committed by the\r\ninstigator of St. Bartholomew ?]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE SYRUP FOR COMPOTES, &c.\r\n\r\n1512. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of sugar allow 1-1/2 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the sugar and water together for 1/4 hour, carefully\r\nremoving the scum as it rises: the syrup is then ready for the fruit.\r\nThe articles boiled in this syrup will not keep for any length of time,\r\nit being suitable only for dishes intended to be eaten immediately. A\r\nlarger proportion of sugar must be added for a syrup intended to keep.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CLARIFY SUGAR OR SYRUP.\r\n\r\n1513. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of sugar allow 1/2 pint of water and\r\n1/2 the white of an egg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the sugar, water, and the white of the egg, which should,\r\nbe well beaten, into a preserving-pan or lined saucepan; and do not put\r\nit on the fire till the sugar is dissolved. Then place it on the fire,\r\nand when it boils, throw in a teacupful of cold water, and do not stir\r\nthe sugar after this is added. Bring it to the boiling-point again, and\r\nthen place the pan by the side of the fire, for the preparation to\r\nsettle. Remove all the scum, and the sugar will be ready for use. The\r\nscum should be placed on a sieve, so that what syrup runs from it may be\r\nboiled up again: this must also be well skimmed.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes for the sugar to dissolve; 5 minutes to boil.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The above two recipes are those used in the preparation of\r\ndishes usually made at home. There are many degrees of boiling sugar,\r\nwhich process requires great care, attention, and experience. Caramel\r\nsugar, which makes an elegant cover for sweetmeats, is difficult to\r\nprepare, and is best left to an experienced confectioner. We give the\r\nrecipe, for those of our readers who care to attempt the operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BOIL SUGAR TO CARAMEL.\r\n\r\n1514. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of lump sugar allow 1 gill of spring\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the sugar and water together very quickly over a clear\r\nfire, skimming it very carefully as soon as it boils. Keep it boiling\r\nuntil the sugar snaps when a little of it is dropped in a pan of cold\r\nwater. If it remains hard, the sugar has attained the right degree; then\r\nsqueeze in a little lemon-juice, and let it remain an instant on the\r\nfire. Set the pan into another of cold water, and the caramel is then\r\nready for use. The insides of well-oiled moulds are often ornamented\r\nwith this sugar, which with a fork should be spread over them in fine\r\nthreads or network. A dish of light pastry, tastefully arranged, looks\r\nvery prettily with this sugar spun lightly over it. The sugar must be\r\ncarefully watched, and taken up the instant it is done. Unless the cook\r\nis very experienced and thoroughly understands her business, it is\r\nscarcely worth while to attempt to make this elaborate ornament, as it\r\nmay be purchased quite as economically at a confectioner's, if the\r\nfailures in the preparation are taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOTE OF APPLES.\r\n\r\n_(Soyer's Recipe,--a Dessert Dish.)_\r\n\r\n1515. INGREDIENTS.--6 ripe apples, 1 lemon, 1/2 lb. of lump sugar, 1/2\r\npint of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPÔTE OF APPLES.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Select the apples of a moderate size, peel them, cut them in\r\nhalves, remove the cores, and rub each piece over with a little lemon.\r\nPut the sugar and water together into a lined saucepan, and let them\r\nboil until forming a thickish syrup, when lay in the apples with the\r\nrind of the lemon cut thin, and the juice of the same. Let the apples\r\nsimmer till tender; then take them out very carefully, drain them on a\r\nsieve, and reduce the syrup by boiling it quickly for a few minutes.\r\nWhen both are cold, arrange the apples neatly on a glass dish, pour over\r\nthe syrup, and garnish with strips of green angelica or candied citron.\r\nSmaller apples may be dressed in the same manner: they should not be\r\ndivided in half, but peeled and the cores pushed out with a\r\nvegetable-cutter.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the sugar and water together; from 15 to 25\r\nminutes to simmer the apples.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ from July to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE GINGER.\r\n\r\n(_A Dessert Dish_.)\r\n\r\n1516 INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of any kind of hard apples, 2 lbs. of loaf\r\nsugar, 1-1/2 pint of water, 1 oz. of tincture of ginger.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the sugar and water until they form a rich syrup, adding\r\nthe ginger when it boils up. Pare, core, and cut the apples into pieces;\r\ndip them in cold water to preserve the colour, and boil them in the\r\nsyrup until transparent; but be careful not to let them break. Put the\r\npieces of apple into jars, pour over the syrup, and carefully exclude\r\nthe air, by well covering them. It will remain good some time, if kept\r\nin a dry place.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 5 to 10 minutes to boil the syrup; about 1/2 hour to\r\nsimmer the apples.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in September, October, or November.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE JAM.\r\n\r\n1517. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit weighed after being pared,\r\ncored, and sliced, allow 3/4 lb. of preserving-sugar, the grated rind of\r\n1 lemon, the juice of 1/2 lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the apples, core and slice them very thin, and be\r\nparticular that they are all the same sort. Put them into a jar, stand\r\nthis in a saucepan of boiling water, and let the apples stew until quite\r\ntender. Previously to putting the fruit into the jar, weigh it, to\r\nascertain the proportion of sugar that may be required. Put the apples\r\ninto a preserving-pan, crush the sugar to small lumps, and add it, with\r\nthe grated lemon-rind and juice, to the apples. Simmer these over the\r\nfire for 1/2 hour, reckoning from the time the jam begins to simmer\r\nproperly; remove the scum as it rises, and when the jam is done, put it\r\ninto pots for use. Place a piece of oiled paper over the jam, and to\r\nexclude the air, cover the pots with tissue-paper dipped in the white of\r\nan egg, and stretched over the top. This jam will keep good for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 2 hours to stew in the jar; 1/2 hour to boil after the\r\njam begins to simmer.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 6s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient._--7 or 8 lbs. of apples for 6 pots of jam.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in September, October, or November.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE JELLY.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n1518. INGREDIENTS.--To 6 lbs. of apples allow 3 pints of water; to every\r\nquart of juice allow 2 lbs. of loaf sugar;--the juice of 1/2 lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare, core, and cut the apples into slices, and put them into a\r\njar, with water in the above proportion. Place them in a cool oven, with\r\nthe jar well covered, and when the juice is thoroughly drawn and the\r\napples are quite soft, strain them through a jelly-bag. To every quart\r\nof juice allow 2 lbs. of loaf sugar, which should be crushed to small\r\nlumps, and put into a preserving-pan with the juice. Boil these together\r\nfor rather more than 1/2 hour, remove the scum as it rises, add the\r\nlemon-juice just before it is done, and put the jelly into pots for use.\r\nThis preparation is useful for garnishing sweet dishes, and may be\r\nturned out for dessert.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--The apples to be put in the oven over-night, and left till\r\nmorning; rather more than 1/2 hour to boil the jelly.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 3s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 small pots of jelly.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_,--This should be made in September, October, or November.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n1519. INGREDIENTS.--Apples, water: to every pint of syrup allow 3/4 lb.\r\nof loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare and cut the apples into pieces, remove the cores, and put\r\nthem in a preserving-pan with sufficient cold water to cover them. Let\r\nthem boil for an hour; then drain the syrup from them through a hair\r\nsieve or jelly-bag, and measure the juice; to every pint allow 3/4 lb.\r\nof loaf sugar, and boil these together for 3/4 hour, removing every\r\nparticle of scum as it rises, and keeping the jelly well stirred, that\r\nit may not burn. A little lemon-rind may be boiled with the apples, and\r\na small quantity of strained lemon-juice may be put in the jelly just\r\nbefore it is done, when the flavour is liked. This jelly may be\r\nornamented with preserved greengages, or any other preserved fruit, and\r\nwill turn out very prettily for dessert. It should be stored away in\r\nsmall pots.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour to boil the fruit and water; 3/4 hour to boil the juice\r\nwith the sugar.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for 6 lbs. of apples, with the other ingredients in\r\nproportion, 3s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 small pots of jelly.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in September, October, or November.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE APPLES IN QUARTERS, in imitation of Ginger.\r\n\r\n1520. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of apples allow 3/4 lb. of sugar, 1-1/2\r\noz. of the best white ginger; 1 oz. of ginger to every 1/2 pint of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel, core, and quarter the apples, and put the fruit, sugar,\r\nand ginger in layers into a wide-mouthed jar, and let them remain for 2\r\ndays; then infuse 1 oz. of ginger in 1/2 pint of boiling water, and\r\ncover it closely, and let it remain for 1 day: this quantity of ginger\r\nand water is for 3 lbs. of apples, with the other ingredients in\r\nproportion. Put the apples, &c., into a preserving-pan with the water\r\nstrained from the ginger, and boil till the apples look clear and the\r\nsyrup is rich, which will be in about an hour. The rind of a lemon may\r\nbe added just before the apples have finished boiling; and great care\r\nmust be taken not to break the pieces of apple in putting them into the\r\njars. Serve on glass dishes for dessert.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 days for the apples to remain in the jar with sugar, &c.; 1\r\nday to infuse the ginger; about 1 hour to boil the apples.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for 3 lbs. of apples, with the other ingredients in\r\nproportion, 2s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient._--3 lbs. should fill 3 moderate-sized jars.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This should be made in September, October, or November.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOTE OF APRICOTS.\r\n\r\n(_An elegant Dish_.)\r\n\r\n1521. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of syrup No. 1512, 12 green apricots.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the syrup by recipe No. 1512, and when it is ready, put in\r\nthe apricots whilst the syrup is boiling. Simmer them very gently until\r\ntender, taking care not to let them break; take them out carefully,\r\narrange them on a glass dish, let the syrup cool a little, pour it over\r\nthe apricots, and, when cold, serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 15 to 20 minutes to simmer the apricots.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in June and July, with green apricots.\r\n\r\nAPRICOT JAM or MARMALADE.\r\n\r\n1522. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of ripe apricots, weighed after being\r\nskinned and stoned, allow 1 lb. of sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare the apricots, which should be ripe, as thinly as possible,\r\nbreak them in half, and remove the stones. Weigh the fruit, and to every\r\nlb. allow the same proportion of loaf sugar. Pound the sugar very finely\r\nin a mortar, strew it over the apricots, which should be placed on\r\ndishes, and let them remain for 12 hours. Break the stones, blanch the\r\nkernels, and put them with the sugar and fruit into a preserving-pan.\r\nLet these simmer very gently until clear; take out the pieces of apricot\r\nsingly as they become so, and, as fast as the scum rises, carefully\r\nremove it. Put the apricots into small jars, pour over them the syrup\r\nand kernels, cover the jam with pieces of paper dipped in the purest\r\nsalad-oil, and stretch over the top of the jars tissue-paper, cut about\r\n2 inches larger and brushed over with the white of an egg: when dry, it\r\nwill be perfectly hard and air-tight.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--12 hours sprinkled with sugar; about 3/4 hour to boil the jam.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_.--When cheap, apricots may be purchased for preserving at\r\nabout 1s. 6d. per gallon.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--10 lbs. of fruit for 12 pots of jam.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in August or September.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARBERRIES IN BUNCHES.\r\n\r\n1523. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of syrup No. 1513, barberries.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Prepare some small pieces of clean white wood, 3 inches long\r\nand 1/4 inch wide, and tie the fruit on to these in nice bunches. Have\r\nready some clear syrup, made by recipe No. 1513; put in the barberries,\r\nand simmer them in it for 2 successive days, boiling them for nearly 1/2\r\nhour each day, and covering them each time with the syrup when cold.\r\nWhen the fruit looks perfectly clear, it is sufficiently done, and\r\nshould be stored away in pots, with the syrup poured over, or the fruit\r\nmay be candied.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to simmer each day.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in autumn.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The berries in their natural state make a very pretty\r\ngarnishing for dishes, and may even be used for the same purpose,\r\npreserved as above, and look exceedingly nice on sweet dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE BARLEY-SUGAR.\r\n\r\n1524. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of sugar allow 1/2 pint of water, 1/2\r\nthe white of an egg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the sugar into a well-tinned saucepan, with the water, and,\r\nwhen the former is dissolved, set it over a moderate fire, adding the\r\nwell-beaten egg before the mixture gets warm, and stir it well together.\r\nWhen it boils, remove the scum as it rises, and keep it boiling until no\r\nmore appears, and the syrup looks perfectly clear; then strain it\r\nthrough a fine sieve or muslin bag, and put it back into the saucepan.\r\nBoil it again like caramel, until it is brittle, when a little is\r\ndropped in a basin of cold water: it is then sufficiently boiled. Add a\r\nlittle lemon-juice and a few drops of essence of lemon, and let it stand\r\nfor a minute or two. Have ready a marble slab or large dish, rubbed over\r\nwith salad-oil; pour on it the sugar, and cut it into strips with a pair\r\nof scissors: these strips should then be twisted, and the barley-sugar\r\nstored away in a very dry place. It may be formed into lozenges or\r\ndrops, by dropping the sugar in a very small quantity at a time on to\r\nthe oiled slab or dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 sticks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARROT JAM TO IMITATE APRICOT PRESERVE.\r\n\r\n1525. INGREDIENTS.--Carrots; to every lb. of carrot pulp allow 1 lb. of\r\npounded sugar, the grated rind of 1 lemon, the strained juice of 2, 6\r\nchopped bitter almonds, 2 tablespoonfuls of brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Select young carrots; wash and scrape them clean, cut them into\r\nround pieces, put them into a saucepan with sufficient water to cover\r\nthem, and let them simmer until perfectly soft; then beat them through a\r\nsieve. Weigh the pulp, and to every lb. allow the above ingredients. Put\r\nthe pulp into a preserving-pan with the sugar, and let this boil for 5\r\nminutes, stirring and skimming all the time. When cold, add the\r\nlemon-rind and juice, almonds and brandy; mix these well with the jam;\r\nthen put it into pots, which must be well covered and kept in a dry\r\nplace. The brandy may be omitted, but the preserve will then not keep:\r\nwith the brandy it will remain good for months.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3/4 hour to boil the carrots; 5 minutes to simmer the\r\npulp.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 2d. for 1 lb. of pulp, with the other ingredients in\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill 3 pots.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from July to December.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE CHERRY BRANDY.\r\n\r\n1536. INGREDIENTS.--Morella cherries, good brandy; to every lb. of\r\ncherries allow 3 oz. of pounded sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have ready some glass bottles, which must be perfectly dry.\r\nAscertain that the cherries are not too ripe and are freshly gathered,\r\nand cut off about half of the stalks. Put them into the bottles, with\r\nthe above proportion of sugar to every lb. of fruit; strew this in\r\nbetween the cherries, and, when the bottles are nearly full, pour in\r\nsufficient brandy to reach just below the cork. A few peach or apricot\r\nkernels will add much to their flavour, or a few blanched bitter\r\nalmonds. Put corks or bungs into the bottles, tie over them a piece of\r\nbladder, and store away in a dry place. The cherries will be fit to eat\r\nin 2 or 3 months, and will remain good for years. They are liable to\r\nshrivel and become tough if too much sugar be added to them.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. to 1s. 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--1 lb. of cherries and about 1/4 pint of brandy for a\r\nquart bottle. _Seasonable_ in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIED CHERRIES.\r\n\r\n1527. CHERRIES may be put in a slow oven and thoroughly dried before\r\nthey begin to change colour. They should then be taken out of the oven,\r\ntied in bunches, and stored away in a dry place. In the winter, they may\r\nbe cooked with sugar for dessert, the same as Normandy pippins.\r\nParticular care must be taken that the oven be not too hot. Another\r\nmethod of drying cherries is to stone them, and to put them into a\r\npreserving-pan, with plenty of loaf sugar strewed amongst them. They\r\nshould be simmered till the fruit shrivels, when they should be strained\r\nfrom the juice. The cherries should then be placed in an oven, cool\r\nenough to dry without baking them. About 5 oz. of sugar would be\r\nrequired for 1 lb. of cherries, and the same syrup may be used again to\r\ndo another quantity of fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRY JAM.\r\n\r\n1528. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit, weighed before stoning, allow\r\n1/2 lb. of sugar; to every 6 lbs. of fruit allow 1 pint of red-currant\r\njuice, and to every pint of juice 1 lb. of sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Weigh the fruit before stoning, and allow half the weight of\r\nsugar; stone the cherries, and boil them in a preserving-pan until\r\nnearly all the juice is dried up; then add the sugar, which should be\r\ncrushed to powder, and the currant-juice, allowing 1 pint to every 6\r\nlbs. of cherries (original weight), and 1 lb. of sugar to every pint of\r\njuice. Boil all together until it jellies, which will be in from 20\r\nminutes to 1/2 hour; skim the jam well, keep it well stirred, and, a few\r\nminutes before it is done, crack some of the stones, and add the\r\nkernels: these impart a very delicious flavour to the jam.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--According to the quality of the cherries, from 3/4 to 1 hour to\r\nboil them; 20 minutes to 1/2 hour with the sugar.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 7d. to 8d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--1 pint of fruit for a lb. pot of jam.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in July or August.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE CHERRIES IN SYRUP.\r\n\r\n(_Very delicious_.)\r\n\r\n1529. INGREDIENTS.--4 lbs. of cherries, 3 lbs. of sugar, 1 pint of\r\nwhite-currant juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the cherries be as clear and as transparent as possible,\r\nand perfectly ripe; pick off the stalks, and remove the stones, damaging\r\nthe fruit as little as you can. Make a syrup with the above proportion\r\nof sugar, by recipe No. 1512; mix the cherries with it, and boil them\r\nfor about 15 minutes, carefully skimming them; turn them gently into a\r\npan, and let them remain till the next day; then drain the cherries on a\r\nsieve, and put the syrup and white-currant juice into the preserving-pan\r\nagain. Boil these together until the syrup is somewhat reduced and\r\nrather thick; then put in the cherries, and let them boil for about 5\r\nminutes; take them off the fire, skim the syrup, put the cherries into\r\nsmall pots or wide-mouthed bottles; pour the syrup over, and when quite\r\ncold, tie them down carefully, so that the air is quite excluded.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 minutes to boil the cherries in the syrup; 10 minutes to\r\nboil the syrup and currant-juice; 6 minutes to boil the cherries the\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in July or August.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK-CURRANT JAM.\r\n\r\n1530. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit, weighed before being stripped\r\nfrom the stalks, allow 3/4 lb. of loaf sugar, 1 gill of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the fruit be very ripe, and gathered on a dry day. Strip it\r\nfrom the stalks, and put it into a preserving-pan, with a gill of water\r\nto each lb. of fruit; boil these together for 10 minutes; then add the\r\nsugar, and boil the jam again for 30 minutes, reckoning from the time\r\nwhen the jam simmers equally all over, or longer, should it not appear\r\nto set nicely when a little is poured on to a plate. Keep stirring it to\r\nprevent it from burning, carefully remove all the scum, and when done,\r\npour it into pots. Let it cool, cover the top of the jam with oiled\r\npaper, and the top of the jars with a piece of tissue-paper brushed over\r\non both sides with the white of an egg: this, when cold, forms a hard\r\nstiff cover, and perfectly excludes the air. Great attention must be\r\npaid to the stirring of this jam, as it is very liable to burn, on\r\naccount of the thickness of the juice.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the fruit and water; 30 minutes with the\r\nsugar, or longer.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 6d. to 8d. for a pot capable of holding 1 lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow from 6 to 7 quarts of currants to make 1 dozen pots\r\nof jam, each pot to hold 1 lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in July.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK-CURRANT JELLY.\r\n\r\n1531. INGREDIENTS.--Black currants; to every pint of juice allow 1/4\r\npint of water, 1 lb. of loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Strip the currants from the stalks, which may be done in an\r\nexpeditious manner, by holding the bunch in one hand, and passing a\r\nsmall silver fork down the currants: they will then readily fall from\r\nthe stalks. Put them into a jar, place this jar in a saucepan of boiling\r\nwater, and simmer them until their juice is extracted; then strain them,\r\nand to every pint of juice allow the above proportion of sugar and\r\nwater; stir these ingredients together cold until the sugar is\r\ndissolved; place the preserving-pan on the fire, and boil the jelly for\r\nabout 1/2 hour, reckoning from the time it commences to boil all over,\r\nand carefully remove the scum as it rises. If the jelly becomes firm\r\nwhen a little is put on a plate, it is done; it should then be put into\r\n_small_ pots, and covered the same as the jam in the preceding recipe.\r\nIf the jelly is wanted very clear, the fruit should not be squeezed dry;\r\nbut, of course, so much juice will not be obtained. If the fruit is not\r\nmuch squeezed, it may be converted into a jam for immediate eating, by\r\nboiling it with a little common sugar: this answers very well for a\r\nnursery preserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3/4 hour to extract the juice; 1/2 hour to boil the\r\njelly.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 8d. to 10d. per 1/2-lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--From 3 pints to 2 quarts of fruit should yield a pint of\r\njuice.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in July.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED-CURRANT JAM.\r\n\r\n1532. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit allow 3/4 lb. of loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAM-POT.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the fruit be gathered on a fine day; weigh it, and then\r\nstrip the currants from the stalks; put them into a preserving-pan with\r\nsugar in the above proportion; stir them, and boil them for about 3/4\r\nhour. Carefully remove the scum as it rises. Put the jam into pots, and,\r\nwhen cold, cover with oiled papers; over these put a piece of\r\ntissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg; press\r\nthe paper round the top of the pot, and, when dry, the covering will be\r\nquite hard and air-tight.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour, reckoning from the time the jam boils all\r\nover.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for a lb. pot, from 6d. to 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow from 6 to 7 quarts of currants to make 12 1-lb,\r\npots of jam.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in July.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED-CURRANT JELLY.\r\n\r\n1533. INGREDIENTS.--Red currants; to every pint of juice allow 3/4 lb.\r\nof loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the fruit gathered in fine weather; pick it from the\r\nstalks, put it into a jar, and place this jar in a saucepan of boiling\r\nwater over the fire, and let it simmer gently until the juice is well\r\ndrawn from the currants; then strain them through a jelly-bag or fine\r\ncloth, and, if the jelly is wished very clear, do not squeeze them _too\r\nmuch_, as the skin and pulp from the fruit will be pressed through with\r\nthe juice, and so make the jelly muddy. Measure the juice, and to each\r\npint allow 3/4 lb. of loaf sugar; put these into a preserving-pan, set\r\nit over the fire, and keep stirring the jelly until it is done,\r\ncarefully removing every particle of scum as it rises, using a wooden or\r\nsilver spoon for the purpose, as metal or iron ones would spoil the\r\ncolour of the jelly when it has boiled from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour, put\r\na little of the jelly on a plate, and if firm when cool, it is done.\r\nTake it off the fire, pour it into small gallipots, cover each of the\r\npots with an oiled paper, and then with a piece of tissue-paper brushed\r\nover on both sides with the white of an egg. Label the pots, adding the\r\nyear when the jelly was made, and store it away in a dry place. A jam\r\nmay be made with the currants, if they are not squeezed too dry, by\r\nadding a few fresh raspberries, and boiling all together, with\r\nsufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely. As this preserve is not worth\r\nstoring away, but is only for immediate eating, a smaller proportion of\r\nsugar than usual will be found enough: it answers very well for\r\nchildren's puddings, or for a nursery preserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 3/4 to 1 hour to extract the juice; 20 minutes to 1/2 hour\r\nto boil the jelly.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 8d. to 10d. per 1/2-lb. pot. _Sufficient_.--8\r\nquarts of currants will make from 10 to 12 pots of jelly.\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in July. _Note_.--Should the above proportion\r\nof sugar not be found sufficient for some tastes, add an extra 1/4 lb.\r\nto every pint of juice, making altogether 1 lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE-CURRANT JELLY.\r\n\r\n1534. INGREDIENTS.--White currants; to every pint of juice allow 3/4 lb.\r\nof good loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the currants from the stalks, and put them into a jar;\r\nplace this jar in a saucepan of boiling water, and simmer until the\r\njuice is well drawn from the fruit, which will be in from 3/4 to 1 hour.\r\nThen strain the currants through a fine cloth or jelly-bag; do not\r\nsqueeze them too much, or the jelly will not be clear, and put the juice\r\ninto a very clean preserving-pan, with the sugar. Let this simmer gently\r\nover a clear fire until it is firm, and keep stirring and skimming until\r\nit is done; then pour it into small pots, cover them, and store away in\r\na dry place.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour to draw the juice; 1/2 hour to boil the jelly.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 8d. to 10d. per 1/2-lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient._--From 3 pints to 2 quarts of fruit should yield 1 pint of\r\njuice.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED DAMSONS FOR WINTER USE.\r\n\r\n1535. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit allow 6 oz. of pounded sugar;\r\nmelted mutton suet.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose sound fruit, not too ripe; pick off the stalks, weigh\r\nit, and to every lb. allow the above proportion of pounded sugar. Put\r\nthe fruit into large dry stone jars, sprinkling the sugar amongst it;\r\ncover the jars with saucers, place them in a rather cool oven, and bake\r\nthe fruit until it is quite tender. When cold, cover the top of the\r\nfruit with a piece of white paper cut to the size of the jar; pour over\r\nthis melted mutton suet about an inch thick, and cover the tops of the\r\njars with thick brown paper, well tied down. Keep the jars in a cool dry\r\nplace, and the fruit will remain good till the following Christmas, but\r\nnot much longer.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 5 to 6 hours to bake the damsons, in a very cool oven.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMSON CHEESE.\r\n\r\n1536. INGREDIENTS.--Damsons; to every lb. of fruit pulp allow 1/2 lb. of\r\nloaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the stalks from the damsons, and put them into a\r\npreserving-pan; simmer them over the fire until they are soft,\r\noccasionally stirring them; then beat them through a coarse sieve, and\r\nput the pulp and juice into the preserving-pan, with sugar in the above\r\nproportion, having previously carefully weighed them. Stir the sugar\r\nwell in, and simmer the damsons slowly for 2 hours. Skim well; then boil\r\nthe preserve quickly for 1/2 hour, or until it looks firm and hard in\r\nthe spoon; put it quickly into shallow pots, or very tiny earthenware\r\nmoulds, and, when cold, cover it with oiled papers, and the jars with\r\ntissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg. A few\r\nof the stones may be cracked, and the kernels boiled with the damsons,\r\nwhich very much improves the flavour of the cheese.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour to boil the damsons without the sugar; 2 hours to simmer\r\nthem slowly, 1/2 hour quickly.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 8d. to 10d. per 1/3 lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--1 pint of damsons to make a _very small_ pot of cheese.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in September or October.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOTE OF DAMSONS.\r\n\r\n1537. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of damsons, 1 pint of syrup No. 1512.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure sound ripe damsons; pick the stalks from them, and put\r\nthem into boiling syrup, made by recipe No. 1512. Simmer them gently\r\nuntil the fruit is tender, but not sufficiently soft to break; take them\r\nup, boil the syrup for 5 minutes; pour it over the damsons, and serve.\r\nThis should be sent to table in a glass dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/4 hour to simmer the damsons; 5 minutes to boil the\r\nsyrup.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMSON JAM.\r\n\r\n1538. INGREDIENTS.--Damsons; to every lb. of fruit allow 3/4 lb. of loaf\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the fruit gathered in dry weather; pick it over, and\r\nreject any that is at all blemished. Stone the damsons, weigh them, and\r\nto every lb. allow 3/4 lb. of loaf sugar. Put the fruit and sugar into a\r\npreserving-pan; keep stirring them gently until the sugar is dissolved,\r\nand carefully remove the scum as it rises. Boil the jam for about an\r\nhour, reckoning from the time it commences to simmer all over alike: it\r\nmust be well stirred all the time, or it will be liable to burn and\r\nstick to the pan, which will cause the jam to have a very disagreeable\r\nflavour. When the jam looks firm, and the juice appears to set, it is\r\ndone. Then take it off the fire, put into pots, cover it down, when\r\nquite cold, with oiled and egged papers, the same as in recipe No. 1530,\r\nand store it away in a dry place.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour after the jam simmers all over.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 6d. to 8d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--1-1/2 pint of damsons for a lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in September or October.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VERY NICE PRESERVE OF DAMSONS.\r\n\r\n1539. INGREDIENTS.--To every quart of damsons allow 1/2 lb. of loaf\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the damsons (which should be picked from the stalks and\r\nquite free from blemishes) into a jar, with pounded sugar sprinkled\r\namongst them in the above proportion; tie the jar closely down, set it\r\nin a saucepan of cold water; bring it gradually to boil, and simmer\r\ngently until the damsons are soft, without being broken. Let them stand\r\ntill cold; then strain the juice from them, boil it up well, strain it\r\nthrough a jelly-bag, and pour it over the fruit. Let it cool, cover with\r\noiled papers, and the jars with tissue-paper brushed over on both sides\r\nwith the white of an egg, and store away in a dry cool place.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 3/4 hour to simmer the fruit after the water boils; 1/4\r\nhour to boil the juice.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in September or October.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE DAMSONS, OR ANY KIND OF PLUMS.\r\n\r\n(_Useful in Winter_.)\r\n\r\n1540. INGREDIENTS.--Damsons or plums; boiling water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the fruit into clean dry stone jars, taking care to leave\r\nout all that are broken or blemished. When full, pour boiling water on\r\nthe plums, until it stands one inch above the fruit; cut a piece of\r\npaper to fit the inside of the jar, over which pour melted mutton-suet;\r\ncover down with brown paper, and keep the jars in a dry cool place. When\r\nused, the suet should be removed, the water poured off, and the jelly at\r\nthe bottom of the jar used and mixed with the fruit.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOTE OF GREEN FIGS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPÔTE OF FIGS.]\r\n\r\n1541. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of syrup No. 1512, 1-1/2 pint of green figs,\r\nthe rind of 1/2 lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a syrup by recipe No. 1512, boiling with it the\r\nlemon-rind, and carefully remove all the scum as it rises. Put in the\r\nfigs, and simmer them very slowly until tender; dish them on a glass\r\ndish; reduce the syrup by boiling it quickly for 5 minutes; take out the\r\nlemon-peel, pour the syrup over the figs, and the compote, when cold,\r\nwill be ready for table. A little port wine, or lemon-juice, added just\r\nbefore the figs are done, will be found an improvement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 to 3 hours to stew the figs.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, figs, 2s. to 3s. per dozen.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BOTTLE FRESH FRUIT.\r\n\r\n(_Very useful in Winter_.)\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n1542. INGREDIENTS.--Fresh fruits, such as currants, raspberries,\r\ncherries, gooseberries, plums of all kinds, damsons, &c.; wide-mouthed\r\nglass bottles, new corks to fit them tightly.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the fruit be full grown, but not too ripe, and gathered in\r\ndry weather. Pick it off the stalks without bruising or breaking the\r\nskin, and reject any that is at all blemished: if gathered in the damp,\r\nor if the skins are cut at all, the fruit will mould. Have ready some\r\n_perfectly dry_ glass bottles, and some nice new soft corks or bungs;\r\nburn a match in each bottle, to exhaust the air, and quickly place the\r\nfruit in to be preserved; gently cork the bottles, and put them into a\r\nvery cool oven, where let them remain until the fruit has shrunk away a\r\nfourth part. Then take the bottles out; _do not open them,_ but\r\nimmediately beat the corks in tight, cut off the tops, and cover them\r\nwith melted resin. If kept in a dry place, the fruit will remain good\r\nfor months; and on this principally depends the success of the\r\npreparation; for if stored away in a place that is in the least damp,\r\nthe fruit will soon spoil.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 5 to 6 hours in a very slow oven.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n1543. INGREDIENTS.--Any kind of fresh fruit, such as currants, cherries,\r\ngooseberries, all kinds of plums, &c.; wide-mouthed glass bottles, new\r\ncorks to fit them tightly.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--The fruit must be full-grown, not too ripe, and gathered on a\r\nfine day. Let it be carefully picked and put into the bottles, which\r\nmust be clean and perfectly dry. Tie over the tops of the bottles pieces\r\nof bladder; stand the bottles in a large pot, copper, or boiler, with\r\ncold water to reach to their necks; kindle a fire under, let the water\r\nboil, and as the bladders begin to rise and puff, prick them. As soon as\r\nthe water boils, extinguish the fire, and let the bottles remain where\r\nthey are, to become cold. The next day remove the bladders, and strew\r\nover the fruit a thick layer of pounded sugar; fit the bottles with\r\ncorks, and let each cork lie close at hand to its own bottle. Hold for a\r\nfew moments, in the neck of the bottle, two or three lighted matches,\r\nand when they have filled the bottle neck with gas, and before they go\r\nout, remove them very quickly; instantly cork the bottle closely, and\r\ndip it in bottle cement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether about 8 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BOTTLE FRESH FRUIT WITH SUGAR.\r\n\r\n(_Very useful in Winter_.)\r\n\r\n1544. INGREDIENTS.--Any kind of fresh fruit; to each quart bottle allow\r\n1/4 lb. of pounded sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the fruit be gathered in dry weather. Pick it carefully,\r\nand drop it into _clean_ and _very dry_ quart glass bottles, sprinkling\r\nover it the above proportion of pounded sugar to each quart. Put the\r\ncorks in the bottles, and place them in a copper of cold water up to\r\ntheir necks, with small hay-wisps round them, to prevent the bottles\r\nfrom knocking together. Light the fire under, bring the water gradually\r\nto boil, and let it simmer gently until the fruit in the bottles is\r\nreduced nearly one third. Extinguish the fire, _and let the bottles\r\nremain in the water until it is perfectly cold;_ then take them out,\r\nmake the corks secure, and cover them with melted resin or wax.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1 hour from the time the water commences to boil.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FROST HOLLY-LEAVES, for garnishing and decorating Dessert and Supper\r\nDishes.\r\n\r\n1545.--INGREDIENTS.--Sprigs of holly, oiled butter, coarsely-powdered\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure some nice sprigs of holly; pick the leaves from the\r\nstalks, and wipe them with a clean cloth free from all moisture; then\r\nplace them on a dish near the fire, to get thoroughly dry, but not too\r\nnear to shrivel the leaves; dip them into oiled butter, sprinkle over\r\nthem some coarsely-powdered sugar, and dry them before the fire. They\r\nshould be kept in a dry place, as the least damp would spoil their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 10 minutes to dry before the fire.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--These may be made at any time; but are more suitable for\r\nwinter garnishes, when fresh flowers are not easily obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOTE OF GOOSEBERRIES.\r\n\r\n1546. INGREDIENTS.--Syrup made by recipe No. 1512; to 1 pint of syrup\r\nallow nearly a quart of gooseberries.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Top and tail the gooseberries, which should not be very ripe,\r\nand pour over them some boiling water; then take them out, and plunge\r\nthem into cold water, with which has been mixed a tablespoonful of\r\nvinegar, which will assist to keep the fruit a good colour. Make a pint\r\nof syrup by recipe No. 1512, and when it boils, drain the gooseberries\r\nand put them in; simmer them gently until the fruit is nicely pulped and\r\ntender, without being broken; then dish the gooseberries on a glass\r\ndish, boil the syrup for 2 or 3 minutes, pour over the gooseberries, and\r\nserve cold.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 5 minutes to boil the gooseberries in the syrup; 3\r\nminutes to reduce the syrup.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_,--a quart of gooseberries for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in June.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRY JAM.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n1547. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit allow 3/4 lb. of loaf sugar;\r\ncurrant-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Select red hairy gooseberries; have them gathered in dry\r\nweather, when quite ripe, without being too soft. Weigh them; with a\r\npair of scissors, cut off the tops and tails, and to every 6 lbs. of\r\nfruit have ready 1/2 pint of red-currant juice, drawn as for jelly. Put\r\nthe gooseberries and currant-juice into a preserving-pan; let them boil\r\ntolerably quickly, keeping them well stirred; when they begin to break,\r\nadd to them the sugar, and keep simmering until the jam becomes firm,\r\ncarefully skimming: and stirring it, that it does not burn at the\r\nbottom. It should be boiled rather a long time, or it will not keep. Put\r\nit into pots (not too large); let it get perfectly cold; then cover the\r\npots down with oiled and egged papers, as directed for red-currant jelly\r\nNo. 1533.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1 hour to boil the gooseberries in the currant-juice;\r\nfrom 1/2 to 3/4 hour with the sugar.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, per lb. pot, from 6d. to 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1-1/2 pint of fruit for a lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in June or July.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n1548. INGREDIENTS.--To every 8 lbs. of red, rough, ripe gooseberries\r\nallow 1 quart of red-currant juice, 5 lbs. of loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the fruit gathered in dry weather, and cut off the tops\r\nand tails. Prepare 1 quart of red-currant juice, the same as for\r\nred-currant jelly No. 1533; put it into a preserving-pan with the sugar,\r\nand keep stirring until the latter is dissolved. Keep it boiling for\r\nabout 5 minutes; skim well; then put in the gooseberries, and let them\r\nboil from 1/2 to 3/4 hour; then turn the whole into an earthen pan, and\r\nlet it remain for 2 days. Boil the jam up again until it looks clear;\r\nput it into pots, and when cold, cover with oiled paper, and over the\r\njars put tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an\r\negg, and store away in a dry place. Care must be taken, in making this,\r\nto keep the jam well stirred and well skimmed, to prevent it burning at\r\nthe bottom of the pan, and to have it very clear.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes to boil the currant-juice and sugar after the latter\r\nis dissolved; from 1/2 to 3/4 hour to simmer the gooseberries the first\r\ntime, 1/4 hour the second time of boiling.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 8d. to 10d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1-1/2 pint of fruit for a lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in June or July.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE OR GREEN GOOSEBERRY JAM.\r\n\r\n1549. INGREDIENTS.--Equal weight of fruit and sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Select the gooseberries not very ripe, either white or green,\r\nand top and tail them. Boil the sugar with water (allowing 1/2 pint to\r\nevery lb.) for about 1/4 hour, carefully removing the scum as it rises;\r\nthen put in the gooseberries, and simmer gently till clear and firm: try\r\na little of the jam on a plate; if it jellies when cold, it is done, and\r\nshould then be poured into pots. When cold, cover with oiled paper, and\r\ntissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the unbeaten white of an\r\negg, and store away in a dry place.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to boil the sugar and water, 3/4 hour the jam.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 6d. to 8d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1-1/2 pint of fruit for a lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in June.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRY JELLY.\r\n\r\n1550. INGREDIENTS.--Gooseberries; to every pint of juice allow 3/4 lb.\r\nof loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the gooseberries, after cutting off the tops and tails,\r\ninto a preserving-pan, and stir them over the fire until they are quite\r\nsoft; then strain them through a sieve, and to every pint of juice allow\r\n3/4 lb. of sugar. Boil the juice and sugar together for nearly 3/4 hour,\r\nstirring and skimming all the time; and if the jelly appears firm when a\r\nlittle of it is poured on to a plate, it is done, and should then be\r\ntaken up and put into small pots. Cover the pots with oiled and egged\r\npapers, the same as for currant jelly No. 1533, and store away in a dry\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour to simmer the gooseberries without the sugar; 3/4 hour\r\nto boil the juice.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 8d. to 10d. per 1/2-lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOTE OF GREENGAGES.\r\n\r\n1551. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of syrup made by recipe No. 1512, 1 quart of\r\ngreengages.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make a syrup by recipe No. 1512, skim it well, and put in the\r\ngreengages when the syrup is boiling, having previously removed the\r\nstalks and stones from the fruit. Boil gently for 1/4 hour, or until the\r\nfruit is tender; but take care not to let it break, as the appearance of\r\nthe dish would be spoiled were the fruit reduced to a pulp. Take the\r\ngreengages carefully out, place them on a glass dish, boil the syrup for\r\nanother 5 minutes, let it cool a little, pour over the fruit, and, when\r\ncold, it will be ready for use.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to simmer the fruit, 5 minutes the syrup.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July, August, and September.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENGAGE JAM.\r\n\r\n1552. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit, weighed before being stoned,\r\nallow 3/4 lb. of lump sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Divide the greengages, take out the stones, and put them into a\r\npreserving-pan. Bring the fruit to a boil, then add the sugar, and keep\r\nstirring it over a gentle fire until it is melted. Remove all the scum\r\nas it rises, and, just before the jam is done, boil it rapidly for 5\r\nminutes. To ascertain when it is sufficiently boiled, pour a little on a\r\nplate, and if the syrup thickens and appears firm, it is done. Have\r\nready half the kernels blanched; put them into the jam, give them one\r\nboil, and pour the preserve into pots. When cold, cover down with oiled\r\npapers, and, over these, tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with\r\nthe white of an egg.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour after the sugar is added.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 6d. to 8d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient._--Allow about 1-1/2 pint of fruit for every lb. pot of jam.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in August or September.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE AND DRY GREENGAGES.\r\n\r\n1553. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of sugar allow 1 lb. of fruit, 1/4 pint\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--For this purpose, the fruit must be used before it is quite\r\nripe, and part of the stalk must be left on. Weigh the fruit, rejecting\r\nall that is in the least degree blemished, and put it into a lined\r\nsaucepan with the sugar and water, which should have been previously\r\nboiled together to a rich syrup. Boil the fruit in this for 10 minutes,\r\nremove it from the fire, and drain the greengages. The next day, boil up\r\nthe syrup and put in the fruit again, and let it simmer for 3 minutes,\r\nand drain the syrup away. Continue this process for 5 or 6 days, and the\r\nlast time place the greengages, when drained, on a hair sieve, and put\r\nthem in an oven or warm spot to dry; keep them in a box, with paper\r\nbetween each layer, in a place free from damp.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes the first time of boiling.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in August or September.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVED GREENGAGES IN SYRUP.\r\n\r\n1554. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit allow 1 lb. of loaf sugar 1/4\r\npint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the sugar and water together for about 10 minutes; divide\r\nthe greengages, take out the stones, put the fruit into the syrup, and\r\nlet it simmer gently until nearly tender. Take it off the fire, put it\r\ninto a large pan, and, the next day, boil it up again for about 10\r\nminutes with the kernels from the stones, which should be blanched. Put\r\nthe fruit carefully into jars, pour over it the syrup, and, when cold,\r\ncover down, so that the air is quite excluded. Let the syrup be well\r\nskimmed both the first and second day of boiling, otherwise it will not\r\nbe clear.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the syrup; 1/4 hour to simmer the fruit the\r\nfirst day, 10 minutes the second day.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 6d. to 8d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient._--Allow about 1 pint of fruit to fill a 1-lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in August or September.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE FRUIT ICE-CREAMS.\r\n\r\n1555. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of fruit-juice allow 1 pint of cream;\r\nsugar to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the fruit be well ripened; pick it off the stalks, and put\r\nit into a large earthen pan. Stir it about with a wooden spoon, breaking\r\nit until it is well mashed; then, with the back of the spoon, rub it\r\nthrough a hair sieve. Sweeten it nicely with pounded sugar; whip the\r\ncream for a few minutes, add it to the fruit, and whisk the whole again\r\nfor another 5 minutes. Put the mixture into the freezing-pot, and freeze\r\nin the same manner as directed for Ice Pudding, No. 1290, taking care to\r\nstir the cream, &c., two or three times, and to remove it from the sides\r\nof the vessel, that the mixture may be equally frozen and smooth. Ices\r\nare usually served in glasses, but if moulded, as they sometimes are for\r\ndessert, must have a small quantity of melted isinglass added to them,\r\nto enable them to keep their shape. Raspberry, strawberry, currant, and\r\nall fruit ice-creams, are made in the same manner. A little pounded\r\nsugar sprinkled over the fruit before it is mashed assists to extract\r\nthe juice. In winter, when fresh fruit is not obtainable, a little jam\r\nmay be substituted for it: it should be melted and worked through a\r\nsieve before being added to the whipped cream; and if the colour should\r\nnot be good, a little prepared cochineal or beetroot may be put in to\r\nimprove its appearance.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to freeze the mixture.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with cream at 1s. per pint, 4d. each ice.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_, with fresh fruit, in June, July, and August.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE FRUIT-WATER ICES.\r\n\r\n1556. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of fruit-juice allow 1 pint of syrup\r\nmade by recipe No. 1513.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISH OF ICES.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Select nice ripe fruit; pick off the stalks, and put it into a\r\nlarge earthen pan, with a little pounded sugar strewed over; stir it\r\nabout with a wooden spoon until it is well broken, then rub it through a\r\nhair sieve. Make the syrup by recipe No. 1513, omitting the white of the\r\negg; let it cool, add the fruit-juice, mix well together, and put the\r\nmixture into the freezing-pot. Proceed as directed for Ice Puddings, No.\r\n1290, and when the mixture is equally frozen, put it into small glasses.\r\nRaspberry, strawberry, currant, and other fresh-fruit-water ices, are\r\nmade in the same manner.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to freeze the mixture.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3d. to 4d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_, with fresh fruit, in June, July, and August.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON-WATER ICE.\r\n\r\n1557. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of syrup, made by recipe No. 1513,\r\nallow 1/3 pint of lemon-juice; the rind of 4 lemons.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the sugar on the rinds of the lemons, and with it make the\r\nsyrup by recipe No. 1513, omitting the white of egg. Strain the\r\nlemon-juice, add it to the other ingredients, stir well, and put the\r\nmixture into a freezing-pot. Freeze as directed for Ice Pudding, No.\r\n1290, and, when the mixture is thoroughly and equally frozen, put it\r\ninto ice-glasses.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to freeze the mixture. _Average cost_, 3d. to 4d.\r\neach.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nICED CURRANTS, for Dessert.\r\n\r\n1558. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 pint of water, the whites of 2 eggs, currants,\r\npounded sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Select very fine bunches of red or white currants, and well\r\nbeat the whites of the eggs. Mix these with the water; then take the\r\ncurrants, a bunch at a time, and dip them in; let them drain for a\r\nminute or two, and roll them in very fine pounded sugar. Lay them to dry\r\non paper, when the sugar will crystallize round each currant, and have a\r\nvery pretty effect. All fresh fruit may be prepared in the same manner;\r\nand a mixture of various fruits iced in this manner, and arranged on one\r\ndish, looks very well for a summer dessert.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 day to dry the fruit.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d. for a pint of iced currants. _Seasonable_ in summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELONS.\r\n\r\n1559.--This fruit is rarely preserved or cooked in any way, and should\r\nbe sent to table on a dish garnished with leaves or flowers, as fancy\r\ndictates. A border of any other kind of small fruit, arranged round the\r\nmelon, has a pretty effect, the colour the former contrasting nicely\r\nwith the melon. Plenty of pounded sugar should be served with it; and\r\nthe fruit should be cut lengthwise, in moderate-sized slices. In\r\nAmerica, it is frequently eaten with pepper and salt.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_,--English, in full season, 3s. 6d. to 5s. each; when\r\nscarce, 10s. to 15s.; _seasonable_, June to August. French, 2s. to 3s.\r\n6d. each; _seasonable_, June and July. Dutch, 9d. to 2s. each;\r\n_seasonable_, July and August.\r\n\r\n    MELON.--The melon is a most delicious fruit, succulent, cool,\r\n    and high-flavoured. With us, it is used only at the dessert, and\r\n    is generally eaten with sugar, ginger, or pepper; but, in\r\n    France, it is likewise served up at dinner as a sauce for boiled\r\n    meats. It grows wild in Tartary, and has been lately found in\r\n    abundance on the sandy plains of Jeypoor. It was brought\r\n    originally from Asia by the Romans, and is said to have been\r\n    common in England in the time of Edward III., though it is\r\n    supposed that it was lost again, as well as the cucumber, during\r\n    the wars of York and Lancaster. The best kind, called the\r\n    _Cantaloupe_, from the name of a place near Rome where it was\r\n    first cultivated in Europe, is a native of Armenia, where it\r\n    grows so plentifully that a horse-load may be bought for a\r\n    crown.\r\n\r\nPRESERVED MULBERRIES.\r\n\r\n1560. INGREDIENTS.--To 2 lbs. of fruit and 1 pint of juice allow 2-1/2\r\nlbs. of loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put some of the fruit into a preserving-pan, and simmer it\r\ngently until the juice is well drawn. Strain it through a bag, measure\r\nit, and to every pint allow the above proportion of sugar and fruit. Put\r\nthe sugar into the preserving-pan, moisten it with the juice, boil it\r\nup, skim well, and then add the mulberries, which should be ripe, but\r\nnot soft enough to break to a pulp. Let them stand in the syrup till\r\nwarm through, then set them on the fire to boil gently; when half done,\r\nturn them carefully into an earthen pan, and let them remain till the\r\nnext day; then boil them as before, and when the syrup is thick, and\r\nbecomes firm when cold, put the preserve into pots. In making this, care\r\nshould be taken not to break the mulberries: this may be avoided by very\r\ngentle stirring, and by simmering the fruit very slowly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 hour to extract the juice;\r\n\r\n1/4 hour to boil the mulberries the first time, 1/4 hour the second\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in August and September.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MULBERRY.]\r\n\r\nMULBERRY.--Mulberries are esteemed for their highly aromatic flavour,\r\nand their sub-acid nature. They are considered as cooling, laxative, and\r\ngenerally wholesome. This fruit was very highly esteemed by the Romans,\r\nwho appear to have preferred it to every other. The mulberry-tree is\r\nstated to have been introduced into this country in 1548, being first\r\nplanted at Sion House, where the original trees still thrive. The\r\nplanting of them was much encouraged by King James I. about 1605; and\r\nconsiderable attempts were made at that time to rear silkworms on a\r\nlarge scale for the purpose of making silk; but these endeavours have\r\nalways failed, the climate being scarcely warm enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE MORELLO CHERRIES.\r\n\r\n1561. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of cherries allow 1-1/4 lb. of sugar, 1\r\ngill of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Select ripe cherries; pick off the stalks, and reject all that\r\nhave any blemishes. Boil the sugar and water together for 5 minutes; put\r\nin the cherries, and boil them for 10 minutes, removing the scum as it\r\nrises. Then turn the fruit, &c. into a pan, and let it remain until the\r\nnext day, when boil it all again for another 10 minutes, and, if\r\nnecessary, skim well. Put the cherries into small pots; pour over them\r\nthe syrup, and, when cold, cover down with oiled papers, and the tops of\r\nthe jars with tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of\r\nan egg, and keep in a dry place.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 25 minutes to boil.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 8d. to 10d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in July or August.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHERRY-TREE IN ROME.--The Cherry-tree was introduced into Rome by\r\nLucullus about seventy years before the Christian era; but the capital\r\nof the world knew not at first how to appreciate this present as it\r\ndeserved; for the cherry-tree was propagated so slowly in Italy, that\r\nmore than a century after its introduction it was far from being\r\ngenerally cultivated. The Romans distinguished three principal species\r\nof cherries--the _Apronian_, of a bright red, with a firm and delicate\r\npulp; the _Lutatian_, very black and sweet; the _Caecilian_, round and\r\nstubby, and much esteemed. The cherry embellished the third course in\r\nRome and the second at Athens.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVED NECTARINES.\r\n\r\n1562. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of sugar allow 1/4 pint of water;\r\nnectarines.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Divide the nectarines in two, take out the stones, and make a\r\nstrong syrup with sugar and water in the above proportion. Put in the\r\nnectarines, and boil them until they have thoroughly imbibed the sugar.\r\nKeep the fruit as whole as possible, and turn it carefully into a pan.\r\nThe next day boil it again for a few minutes, take out the nectarines,\r\nput them into jars, boil the syrup quickly for 5 minutes, pour it over\r\nthe fruit, and, when cold, cover the preserve down. The syrup and\r\npreserve must be carefully skimmed, or it will not be clear.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the sugar and water; 20 minutes to boil the\r\nfruit the first time, 10 minutes the second time; 5 minutes to boil the\r\nsyrup.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in August and September, but cheapest in September.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED NORMANDY PIPPINS.\r\n\r\n1563. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of Normandy pippins, 1 quart of water, 1/2\r\nteaspoonful of powdered cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoonful of ground ginger, 1\r\nlb. of moist sugar, 1 lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Well wash the pippins, and put them into 1 quart of water with\r\nthe above proportion of cinnamon and ginger, and let them stand 12\r\nhours; then put these all together into a stewpan, with the lemon sliced\r\nthinly, and half the moist sugar. Let them boil slowly until the pippins\r\nare half done; then add the remainder of the sugar, and simmer until\r\nthey are quite tender. Serve on glass dishes for dessert.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 to 3 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d. _Seasonable_.--Suitable\r\nfor a winter dish.\r\n\r\n\r\nICED ORANGES.\r\n\r\n1564. INGREDIENTS.--Oranges; to every lb. of pounded loaf sugar allow\r\nthe whites of 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Whisk the whites of the eggs well, stir in the sugar, and beat\r\nthis mixture for 1/4 hour. Skin the oranges, remove as much of the white\r\npith as possible without injuring the pulp of the fruit; pass a thread\r\nthrough the centre of each orange, dip them into the sugar, and tie them\r\nto a stick. Place this stick across the oven, and let the oranges remain\r\nuntil dry, when they will have the appearance of balls of ice. They make\r\na pretty dessert or supper dish. Care must be taken not to have the oven\r\ntoo fierce, or the oranges would scorch and acquire a brown colour,\r\nwhich would entirely spoil their appearance.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 1/2 to 1 hour to dry in a moderate oven.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1-1/2d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--1/2 lb. of sugar to ice 12 oranges.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to May.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST ORANGE-TREE IN FRANCE.--The first Orange-tree cultivated in\r\nthe centre of France was to be seen a few years ago at Fontainebleau. It\r\nwas called _Le Connétable_ (the Constable), because it had belonged to\r\nthe Connétable de Bourbon, and had been confiscated, together with all\r\nproperty belonging to that prince, after his revolt against his\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOTE OF ORANGES.\r\n\r\n1565. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of syrup No. 1512, 6 oranges. _Mode_.--Peel\r\nthe oranges, remove as much of the white pith as possible, and divide\r\nthem into small pieces without breaking the thin skin with which they\r\nare surrounded. Make the syrup by recipe No. 1512, adding the rind of\r\nthe orange cut into thin narrow strips. When the syrup has been well\r\nskimmed, and is quite clear, put in the pieces of orange, and simmer\r\nthem for 5 minutes. Take them out carefully with a spoon without\r\nbreaking them, and arrange them on a glass dish. Reduce the syrup by\r\nboiling it quickly until thick; let it cool a little, pour it over the\r\noranges, and, when cold, they will be ready for table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPÔTE OF ORANGES.]\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the syrup; 5 minutes to simmer the oranges;\r\n5 minutes to reduce the syrup.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to May.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORANGE IN PORTUGAL.--The Orange known under the name of \"Portugal\r\nOrange\" comes originally from China. Not more than two centuries ago,\r\nthe Portuguese brought thence the first scion, which has multiplied so\r\nprodigiously that we now see entire forests of orange-trees in Portugal.\r\n\r\nORANGE AND CLOVES.--It appears to have been the custom formerly, in\r\nEngland, to make new year's presents with oranges stuck full with\r\ncloves. We read in one of Ben Jonson's pieces,--the \"Christmas\r\nMasque,\"--\"He has an orange and rosemary, but not a clove to stick in\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE MARMALADE.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n1566. INGREDIENTS.--Equal weight of fine loaf sugar and Seville oranges;\r\nto 12 oranges allow 1 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let there be an equal weight of loaf sugar and Seville oranges,\r\nand allow the above proportion of water to every dozen oranges. Peel\r\nthem carefully, remove a little of the white pith, and boil the rinds in\r\nwater 2 hours, changing the water three times to take off a little of\r\nthe bitter taste. Break the pulp into small pieces, take out all the\r\npips, and cut the boiled rind into chips. Make a syrup with the sugar\r\nand water; boil this well, skim it, and, when clear, put in the pulp and\r\nchips. Boil all together from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour; pour it into pots,\r\nand, when cold, cover down with bladders or tissue-paper brushed over on\r\nboth sides with the white of an egg. The juice and grated rind of 2\r\nlemons to every dozen of oranges, added with the pulp and chips to the\r\nsyrup, are a very great improvement to this marmalade.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours to boil the orange-rinds; 10 minutes to boil the syrup;\r\n20 minutes to 1/2 hour to boil the marmalade.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 6d. to 8d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This should be made in March or April, as Seville oranges\r\nare then in perfection.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n1567. INGREDIENTS.--Equal weight of Seville oranges and sugar; to every\r\nlb. of sugar allow 1/2 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Weigh the sugar and oranges, score the skin across, and take it\r\noff in quarters. Boil these quarters in a muslin bag in water until they\r\nare quite soft, and they can be pierced easily with the head of a pin;\r\nthen cut them into chips about 1 inch long, and as thin as possible.\r\nShould there be a great deal of white stringy pulp, remove it before\r\ncutting the rind into chips. Split open the oranges, scrape out the best\r\npart of the pulp, with the juice, rejecting the white pith and pips.\r\nMake a syrup with the sugar and water; boil it until clear; then put in\r\nthe chips, pulp, and juice, and boil the marmalade from 20 minutes to\r\n1/2 hour, removing all the scum as it rises. In boiling the syrup, clear\r\nit carefully from scum before the oranges are added to it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours to boil the rinds, 10 minutes the syrup, 20 minutes to\r\n1/2 hour the marmalade.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d. to 8d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in March or April, when Seville oranges are in\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EASY WAY OF MAKING ORANGE MARMALADE.\r\n\r\n1568. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of pulp allow 1-1/2 lb. of loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose some fine Seville oranges; put them whole into a stewpan\r\nwith sufficient water to cover them, and stew them until they become\r\nperfectly tender, changing the water 2 or 3 times; drain them, take off\r\nthe rind, remove the pips from the pulp, weigh it, and to every lb.\r\nallow 1-1/2 of loaf sugar and 1/2 pint of the water the oranges were\r\nlast boiled in. Boil the sugar and water together for 10 minutes; put in\r\nthe pulp, boil for another 10 minutes; then add the peel cut into\r\nstrips, and boil the marmalade for another 10 minutes, which completes\r\nthe process. Pour it into jars; let it cool; then cover down with\r\nbladders, or tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of\r\nan egg.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours to boil the oranges; altogether 1/2 hour to boil the\r\nmarmalade.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 6d. to 8d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_--Make this in March or April.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE MARMALADE MADE WITH HONEY.\r\n\r\n1569. INGREDIENTS.--To 1 quart of the juice and pulp of Seville oranges\r\nallow 2 lbs. of honey, 1 lb. of the rind.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the oranges and boil the rind in water until tender, and\r\ncut it into strips. Take away the pips from the juice and pulp, and put\r\nit with the honey and chips into a preserving-pan; boil all together for\r\nabout 1/2 hour, or until the marmalade is of the proper consistency; put\r\nit into pots, and, when cold, cover down with bladders.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours to boil the rind, 1/2 hour the marmalade.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 7d. to 9d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in March or April.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE ORANGES.\r\n\r\n1570. INGREDIENTS.--Oranges; to every lb. of juice and pulp allow 2 lbs.\r\nof loaf sugar; to every pint of water 1/2 lb. of loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wholly grate or peel the oranges, taking off only the thin\r\noutside portion of the rind. Make a small incision where the stalk is\r\ntaken out, squeeze out as much of the juice as can be obtained, and\r\npreserve it in a basin with the pulp that accompanies it. Put the\r\noranges into cold water; let them stand for 3 days, changing the water\r\ntwice; then boil them in fresh water till they are very tender, and put\r\nthem to drain. Make a syrup with the above proportion of sugar and\r\nwater, sufficient to cover the oranges; let them stand in it for 2 or 3\r\ndays; then drain them well. Weigh the juice and pulp, allow double their\r\nweight of sugar, and boil them together until the scum ceases to rise,\r\nwhich must all be carefully removed; put in the oranges, boil them for\r\n10 minutes, place them in jars, pour over them the syrup, and, when\r\ncold, cover down. They will be fit for use in a week.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 days for the oranges to remain in water, 3 days in the syrup;\r\n1/2 hour to boil the pulp, 10 minutes the oranges.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This preserve should be made in February or March, when\r\noranges are plentiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE SALAD.\r\n\r\n1571. INGREDIENTS.--6 oranges, 1/4 lb. of muscatel raisins, 2 oz. of\r\npounded sugar, 4 tablespoonfuls of brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel 5 of the oranges; divide them into slices without breaking\r\nthe pulp, and arrange them on a glass dish. Stone the raisins, mix them\r\nwith the sugar and brandy, and mingle them with the oranges. Squeeze the\r\njuice of the other orange over the whole, and the dish is ready for\r\ntable. A little pounded spice may be put in when the flavour is liked;\r\nbut this ingredient must be added very sparingly.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from November to May.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOTE OF PEACHES.\r\n\r\n1572. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of syrup No. 1512, about 15 small peaches.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peaches that are not very large, and that would not look well\r\nfor dessert, answer very nicely for a compôte. Divide the peaches, take\r\nout the stones, and pare the fruit; make a syrup by recipe No. 1512, put\r\nin the peaches, and stew them gently for about 10 minutes. Take them out\r\nwithout breaking, arrange them on a glass dish, boil the syrup for 2 or\r\n3 minutes, let it cool, pour it over the fruit, and, when cold, it will\r\nbe ready for table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ in August and September.\r\n\r\n    PEACH AND NECTARINE.--The peach and nectarine, which are among\r\n    the most delicious of our fruits, are considered as varieties of\r\n    the same species, produced by cultivation. The former is\r\n    characterized by a very delicate down, while the latter is\r\n    smooth; but, as a proof of their identity as to species, trees\r\n    have borne peaches on one part and nectarines on another; and\r\n    even a single fruit has had down on one side, and on the other\r\n    none; the trees are almost exactly alike, as well as the\r\n    blossoms. Pliny states that the peach was originally brought\r\n    from Persia, where it grows naturally. At Montreuil, a village\r\n    near Paris, almost the whole population is employed in the\r\n    cultivation of peaches; and this occupation has maintained the\r\n    inhabitants for ages, and, in consequence, they raise better\r\n    peaches than anywhere else in France. In Maryland and Virginia,\r\n    peaches grow nearly wild in orchards resembling forests; but the\r\n    fruit is of little value for the table, being employed only in\r\n    fattening hogs and for the distillation of peach brandy. On the\r\n    east side of the Andes, peaches grow wild among the cornfields\r\n    and in the mountains, and are dried as an article of food. The\r\n    young leaves of the peach are sometimes used in cookery, from\r\n    their agreeable flavour; and a liqueur resembling the fine\r\n    noyeau of Martinique may be made by steeping them in brandy\r\n    sweetened with sugar and fined with milk: gin may also be\r\n    flavoured in the same manner. The kernels of the fruit have the\r\n    same flavour. The nectarine is said to have received its name\r\n    from nectar, the particular drink of the gods. Though it is\r\n    considered as the same species as the peach, it is not known\r\n    which of the varieties come from the other; the nectarine, is by\r\n    some considered as the superior fruit.\r\n\r\nPEACHES PRESERVED IN BRANDY.\r\n\r\n1573. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit weighed before being stoned,\r\nallow 1/4 lb. of finely-pounded loaf sugar; brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the fruit be gathered in dry weather; wipe and weigh it,\r\nand remove the stones as carefully as possible, without injuring the\r\npeaches much. Put them into a jar, sprinkle amongst them pounded loaf\r\nsugar in the above proportion, and pour brandy over the fruit. Cover the\r\njar down closely, place it in a saucepan of boiling water over the fire,\r\nand bring the brandy to the simmering-point, but do not allow it to\r\nboil. Take the fruit out carefully, without breaking it; put it into\r\nsmall jars, pour over it the brandy, and, when cold, exclude the air by\r\ncovering the jars with bladders, or tissue-paper brushed over on both\r\nsides with the white of an egg. Apricots may be done in the same manner,\r\nand, if properly prepared, will be found delicious.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 10 to 20 minutes to bring the brandy to the\r\nsimmering-point.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED PEARS.\r\n\r\n1574. INGREDIENTS.--12 pears, the rind of 1 lemon, 6 cloves, 10 whole\r\nallspice; to every pint of water allow 1/2 lb. of loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare and cut the pears into halves, and, should they be very\r\nlarge, into quarters; leave the stalks on, and carefully remove the\r\ncores. Place them in a clean baking-jar, with a closely-fitting lid; add\r\nto them the lemon-rind cut in strips, the juice of 1/2 lemon, the\r\ncloves, pounded allspice, and sufficient water just to cover the whole,\r\nwith sugar in the above proportion. Cover the jar down closely, put it\r\ninto a very cool oven, and bake the pears from 5 to 6 hours, but be very\r\ncareful that the oven is not too hot. To improve the colour of the\r\nfruit, a few drops of prepared cochineal may be added; but this will not\r\nbe found necessary if the pears are very gently baked.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Large pears, 5 to 6 hours, in a very slow oven.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1d. to 2d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to January.\r\n\r\n    PEAR.--The pear, like the apple, is indigenous to this country;\r\n    but the wild pear is a very unsatisfactory fruit. The best\r\n    varieties were brought from the East by the Romans, who\r\n    cultivated them with care, and probably introduced some of their\r\n    best sorts into this island, to which others were added by the\r\n    inhabitants of the monasteries. The Dutch and Flemings, as well\r\n    as the French, have excelled in the cultivation of the pear, and\r\n    most of the late varieties introduced are from France and\r\n    Flanders. The pear is a hardy tree, and a longer liver than the\r\n    apple: it has been known to exist for centuries. There are now\r\n    about 150 varieties of this fruit. Though perfectly wholesome\r\n    when ripe, the pear is not so when green; but in this state it\r\n    is fit for stewing. An agreeable beverage, called perry, is made\r\n    from pears, and the varieties which are least fit for eating\r\n    make the best perry.\r\n\r\nPRESERVED PEARS.\r\n\r\n1575. INGREDIENTS.--Jargonelle pears; to every lb. of sugar allow 1/2\r\npint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure some Jargonelle pears, not too ripe; put them into a\r\nstewpan with sufficient water to cover them, and simmer them till rather\r\ntender, but do not allow them to break; then put them into cold water.\r\nBoil the sugar and water together for 5 minutes, skim well, put in the\r\npears, and simmer them gently for 5 minutes. Repeat the simmering for 3\r\nsuccessive days, taking care not to let the fruit break. The last time\r\nof boiling, the syrup should be made rather richer, and the fruit boiled\r\nfor 10 minutes. When the pears are done, drain them from the syrup, and\r\ndry them in the sun, or in a cool oven; or they may be kept in the\r\nsyrup, and dried as they are wanted.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to simmer the pears in water, 20 minutes in the syrup.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1d. to 2d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Most plentiful in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED PEARS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEWED PEARS.]\r\n\r\n1576. INGREDIENTS.--8 large pears, 5 oz. of loaf sugar, 6 cloves, 6\r\nwhole allspice, 1/2 pint of water, 1/4 pint of port wine, a few drops of\r\nprepared cochineal.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare the pears, halve them, remove the cores, and leave the\r\nstalks on; put them into a _lined_ saucepan with the above ingredients,\r\nand let them simmer very gently until tender, which will be in from 3 to\r\n4 hours, according to the quality of the pears. They should be watched,\r\nand, when done, carefully lifted out on to a glass dish without breaking\r\nthem. Boil up the syrup quickly for 2 or 3 minutes; allow it to cool a\r\nlittle, pour it over the pears, and let them get perfectly cold. To\r\nimprove the colour of the fruit, a few drops of prepared cochineal may\r\nbe added, which rather enhances the beauty of this dish. The fruit must\r\nnot be boiled fast, but only simmered, and watched that it be not too\r\nmuch done.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 to 4 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons. _Seasonable_ from September to January.\r\n\r\n    THE BON CHRETIEN PEAR.--The valuable variety of pear called _Bon\r\n    Chrétien_, which comes to our tables in winter, either raw or\r\n    cooked, received its name through the following incident:--Louis\r\n    XI., king of France, had sent for Saint Francois de Paule from\r\n    the lower part of Calabria, in the hopes of recovering his\r\n    health through his intercession. The saint brought with him the\r\n    seeds of this pear; and, as he was called at court Le Bon\r\n    Chrétien, this fruit obtained the name of him to whom France\r\n    owed its introduction.\r\n\r\nPINEAPPLE CHIPS.\r\n\r\n1577. INGREDIENTS.--Pineapples; sugar to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare and slice the fruit thinly, put it on dishes, and strew\r\nover it plenty of pounded sugar. Keep it in a hot closet, or very slow\r\noven, 8 or 10 days, and turn the fruit every day until dry; then put the\r\npieces of pine on tins, and place them in a quick oven for 10 minutes.\r\nLet them cool, and store them away in dry boxes, with paper between each\r\nlayer.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--8 to 10 days.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Foreign pines, in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVED PINEAPPLE.\r\n\r\n1578. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit, weighed after being pared,\r\nallow 1 lb. of loaf sugar; 1/4 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--The pines for making this preserve should be perfectly sound\r\nbut ripe. Cut them into rather thick slices, as the fruit shrinks very\r\nmuch in the boiling. Pare off the rind carefully, that none of the pine\r\nbe wasted; and, in doing so, notch it in and out, as the edge cannot be\r\nsmoothly cut without great waste. Dissolve a portion of the sugar in a\r\npreserving-pan with 1/4 pint of water; when this is melted, gradually\r\nadd the remainder of the sugar, and boil it until it forms a clear\r\nsyrup, skimming well. As soon as this is the case, put in the pieces of\r\npine, and boil well for at least 1/2 hour, or until it looks nearly\r\ntransparent. Put it into pots, cover down when cold, and store away in a\r\ndry place.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to boil the fruit. _Average cost_, 10d. to 1s. per lb.\r\npot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Foreign pines, in July and August.\r\n\r\n    THE PINEAPPLE IN HEATHENDOM.--Heathen nations invented\r\n    protective divinities for their orchards (such as Pomona,\r\n    Vertumnus, Priapus, &c.), and benevolent patrons for their\r\n    fruits: thus, the olive-tree grew under the auspices of Minerva;\r\n    the Muses cherished the palm-tree, Bacchus the fig and grape,\r\n    _and the pine and its cone were consecrated to the great Cyble_.\r\n\r\nPRESERVED PINEAPPLE, for Present Use.\r\n\r\n1579. INGREDIENTS.--Pineapple, sugar, water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the pine into slices 1/4 inch in thickness; peel them, and\r\nremove the hard part from the middle. Put the parings and hard pieces\r\ninto a stewpan with sufficient water to cover them, and boil for 1/4\r\nhour. Strain the liquor, and put in the slices of pine. Stew them for 10\r\nminutes, add sufficient sugar to sweeten the whole nicely, and boil\r\nagain for another 1/4 hour; skim well, and the preserve will be ready\r\nfor use. It must be eaten soon, as it will keep but a very short time.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to boil the parings in water; 10 minutes to boil the\r\npine without sugar, 1/4 hour with sugar.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_.--Foreign pines, 1s. to 3s. each; English, from 2s. to\r\n12s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Foreign, in July and August; English, all the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUM JAM.\r\n\r\n1580. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of plums, weighed before being stoned,\r\nallow 3/4 lb. of loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--In making plum jam, the quantity of sugar for each lb. of fruit\r\nmust be regulated by the quality and size of the fruit, some plums\r\nrequiring much more sugar than others. Divide the plums, take out the\r\nstones, and put them on to large dishes, with roughly-pounded sugar\r\nsprinkled over them in the above proportion, and let them remain for one\r\nday; then put them into a preserving-pan, stand them by the side of the\r\nfire to simmer gently for about 1/2 hour, and then boil them rapidly for\r\nanother 15 minutes. The scum must be carefully removed as it rises, and\r\nthe jam must be well stirred all the time, or it will burn at the bottom\r\nof the pan, and so spoil the colour and flavour of the preserve. Some of\r\nthe stones may be cracked, and a few kernels added to the jam just\r\nbefore it is done: these impart a very delicious flavour to the plums.\r\nThe above proportion of sugar would answer for Orleans plums; the\r\nImpératrice Magnum-bonum, and Winesour would not require quite so much.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour to simmer gently, 1/4 hour to boil rapidly.\r\n\r\n_Best plums for preserving_.--Violets, Mussels, Orleans, Impératrice\r\nMagnum-bonum, and Winesour.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from the end of July to the beginning of October.\r\n\r\n    PLUMS.--The Damson, or Damascene plum, takes its name from\r\n    Damascus, where it grows in great quantities, and whence it was\r\n    brought into Italy about 114 B.C. The Orleans plum is from\r\n    France. The Greengage is called after the Gage family, who first\r\n    brought it into England from the monastery of the Chartreuse, at\r\n    Paris, where it still bears the name of Reine Claude. The\r\n    Magnum-bonum is our largest plum, and greatly esteemed for\r\n    preserves and culinary purposes. The best sorts of plums are\r\n    agreeable at the dessert, and, when perfectly ripe, are\r\n    wholesome; but some are too astringent. They lose much of their\r\n    bad qualities by baking, and are extensively used, from their\r\n    cheapness, when in full season, in tarts and preserves; but they\r\n    are not a very wholesome fruit, and should be eaten in\r\n    moderation.\r\n\r\nPRESERVED PLUMS.\r\n\r\n1581. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit allow 3/4 lb. of loaf sugar;\r\nfor the thin syrup, 1/4 lb. of sugar to each pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Select large ripe plums; slightly prick them, to prevent them\r\nfrom bursting, and simmer them very gently in a syrup made with the\r\nabove proportion of sugar and water. Put them carefully into a pan, let\r\nthe syrup cool, pour it over the plums, and allow them to remain for two\r\ndays. Having previously weighed the other sugar, dip the lumps quickly\r\ninto water, and put them into a preserving-pan with no more water than\r\nhangs about them; and boil the sugar to a syrup, carefully skimming it.\r\nDrain the plums from the first syrup; put them into the fresh syrup, and\r\nsimmer them very gently until they are clear; lift them out singly into\r\npots, pour the syrup over, and when cold, cover down to exclude the air.\r\nThis preserve will remain good some time, if kept in a dry place, and\r\nmakes a very nice addition to a dessert. The magnum-bonum plums answer\r\nfor this preserve better than any other kind of plum. Greengages are\r\nalso very delicious done in this manner.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to 20 minutes to simmer the plums in the first syrup;\r\n20 minutes to 1/2 hour very gentle simmering in the second.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE PLUMS DRY.\r\n\r\n1582. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of sugar allow 1/4 pint of water.\r\n_Mode_.--Gather the plums when they are full-grown and just turning\r\ncolour; prick them, put them into a saucepan of cold water, and set them\r\non the fire until the water is on the point of boiling. Then take them\r\nout, drain them, and boil them gently in syrup made with the above\r\nproportion of sugar and water; and if the plums shrink, and will not\r\ntake the sugar, prick them as they lie in the pan; give them another\r\nboil, skim, and set them by. The next day add some more sugar, boiled\r\nalmost to candy, to the fruit and syrup; put all together into a\r\nwide-mouthed jar, and place them in a cool oven for 2 nights; then drain\r\nthe plums from the syrup, sprinkle a little powdered sugar over, and dry\r\nthem in a cool oven.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 to 20 minutes to boil the plums in the syrup. _Seasonable_\r\nfrom August to October.\r\n\r\n    PLUMS.--The wild sloe is the parent of the plum, but the\r\n    acclimated kinds come from the East. The cultivation of this\r\n    fruit was probably attended to very early in England, as Gerrard\r\n    informs us that, in 1597, he had in his garden, in Holborn,\r\n    threescore sorts. The sloe is a shrub common in our hedgerows,\r\n    and belongs to the natural order _Amygdaleae_; the fruit is\r\n    about the size of a large pea, of a black colour, and covered\r\n    with a bloom of a bright blue. It is one of the few indigenous\r\n    to our island. The juice is extremely sharp and astringent, and\r\n    was formerly employed as a medicine, where astringents were\r\n    necessary. It now assists in the manufacture of a red wine made\r\n    to imitate port, and also for adulteration. The leaves have been\r\n    used to adulterate tea; the fruit, when ripe, makes a good\r\n    preserve.\r\n\r\nSTEWED FRENCH PLUMS.\r\n\r\n(_A Dessert Dish_.)\r\n\r\n1583. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of French plums, 3/4 pint of syrup No.\r\n1512, 1 glass of port wine, the rind and juice of 1 lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Stew the plums gently in water for 1 hour; strain the water,\r\nand with it make the syrup. When it is clear, put in the plums with the\r\nport wine, lemon-juice, and rind, and simmer very gently for 1-1/2 hour.\r\nArrange the plums on a glass dish, take out the lemon-rind, pour the\r\nsyrup over the plums, and, when cold, they will be ready for table. A\r\nlittle allspice stewed with the fruit is by many persons considered an\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour to stew the plums in water, 1-1/2 hour in the syrup.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_,--plums sufficiently good for stewing, 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVED PUMPKIN.\r\n\r\n1584. INGREDIENTS.--To each lb. of pumpkin allow 1 lb. of roughly\r\npounded loaf sugar, 1 gill of lemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Obtain a good sweet pumpkin; halve it, take out the seeds, and\r\npare off the rind; cut it into neat slices, or into pieces about the\r\nsize of a five-shilling piece. Weigh the pumpkin, put the slices in a\r\npan or deep dish in layers, with the sugar sprinkled between them; pour\r\nthe lemon-juice over the top, and let the whole remain for 2 or 3 days.\r\nBoil altogether, adding 1/4 pint of water to every 3 lbs. of sugar used\r\nuntil the pumpkin becomes tender; then turn the whole into a pan, where\r\nlet it remain for a week; then drain off the syrup, boil it until it is\r\nquite thick; skim, and pour it, boiling, over the pumpkin. A little\r\nbruised ginger and lemon-rind, thinly pared, may be boiled in the syrup\r\nto flavour the pumpkin.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 1/2 to 3/4 hour to boil the pumpkin tender.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 5d. to 7d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in September and October; but better when made in the\r\nlatter month, as the pumpkin is then quite ripe.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Vegetable marrows are very good prepared in the same manner,\r\nbut are not quite so rich.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUINCE JELLY.\r\n\r\n1585. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of juice allow 1 lb. of loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare and slice the quinces, and put them into a preserving-pan\r\nwith sufficient water to float them. Boil them until tender, and the\r\nfruit is reduced to a pulp; strain off the clear juice, and to each pint\r\nallow the above proportion of loaf sugar. Boil the juice and sugar\r\ntogether for about 3/4 hour; remove all the scum as it rises, and, when\r\nthe jelly appears firm when a little is poured on a plate, it is done.\r\nThe residue left on the sieve will answer to make a common marmalade,\r\nfor immediate use, by boiling it with 1/2 lb. of common sugar to every\r\nlb. of pulp.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours to boil the quinces in water; 3/4 hour to boil the\r\njelly.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 8d. to 10d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUINCE MARMALADE.\r\n\r\n1586. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of quince pulp allow 3/4 lb. of loaf\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Slice the quinces into a preserving-pan, adding sufficient\r\nwater for them to float; place them on the fire to stew, until reduced\r\nto a pulp, keeping them stirred occasionally from the bottom, to prevent\r\ntheir burning; then pass the pulp through a hair sieve, to keep back the\r\nskin and seeds. Weigh the pulp, and to each lb. add lump sugar in the\r\nabove proportion, broken very small. Place the whole on the fire, and\r\nkeep it well stirred from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon,\r\nuntil reduced to a marmalade, which may be known by dropping a little on\r\na cold plate, when, if it jellies, it is done. Put it into jars whilst\r\nhot; let it cool, and cover with pieces of oiled paper cut to the size\r\nof the mouths of the jars. The tops of them may be afterwards covered\r\nwith pieces of bladder, or tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with\r\nthe white of an egg.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 hours to boil the quinces without the sugar; 3/4 hour to boil\r\nthe pulp with the sugar.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 8d. to 9d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 pint of sliced quinces for a lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in August, September, and October.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISIN CHEESE.\r\n\r\n1587. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of raisins allow a lb. of loaf sugar;\r\npounded cinnamon and cloves to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Stone the raisins; put them into a stewpan with the sugar,\r\ncinnamon, and cloves, and let them boil for 1-1/2 hour, stirring all the\r\ntime. Let the preparation cool a little, pour it into a glass dish, and\r\ngarnish with strips of candied lemon-peel and citron. This will remain\r\ngood some time, if kept in a dry place.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 9d. _Sufficient_.--1 lb. for 4 or 5\r\npersons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRASPBERRY JAM.\r\n\r\n1588. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of raspberries allow 1 lb. of sugar,\r\n1/4 pint of red-currant juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the fruit for this preserve be gathered in fine weather,\r\nand used as soon after it is picked as possible. Take off the stalks,\r\nput the raspberries into a preserving-pan, break them well with a wooden\r\nspoon, and let them boil for 1/4 hour, keeping them well stirred. Then\r\nadd the currant-juice and sugar, and boil again for 1/2 hour. Skim the\r\njam well after the sugar is added, or the preserve will not be clear.\r\nThe addition of the currant juice is a very great improvement to this\r\npreserve, as it gives it a piquant taste, which the flavour of the\r\nraspberries seems to require.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to simmer the fruit without the sugar; 1/4 hour after\r\nit is added.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 6d. to 8d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow about 1 pint of fruit to fill a 1-lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\nRASPBERRY JELLY.\r\n\r\n1589. INGREDIENTS.--To each pint of juice allow 3/4 lb. of loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the raspberries be freshly gathered, quite ripe, and picked\r\nfrom the stalks; put them into a large jar, after breaking the fruit a\r\nlittle with a wooden spoon, and place this jar, covered, in a saucepan\r\nof boiling water. When the juice is well drawn, which will be in from\r\n3/4 to 1 hour, strain the fruit through a fine hair sieve or cloth;\r\nmeasure the juice, and to every pint allow the above proportion of loaf\r\nsugar. Put the juice and sugar into a preserving-pan, place it over the\r\nfire, and boil gently until the jelly thickens when a little is poured\r\non a plate; carefully remove all the scum as it rises, pour the jelly\r\ninto small pots, cover down, and keep in a dry place. This jelly answers\r\nfor making raspberry cream, and for flavouring various sweet dishes,\r\nwhen, in winter, the fresh fruit is not obtainable.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 to 1 hour to draw the juice.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 9d. to 1s. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient._--From 3 pints to 2 quarts of fruit should yield 1 pint of\r\njuice.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This should be made in July or August.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHUBARB JAM.\r\n\r\n1590. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of rhubarb allow 1 lb. of loaf sugar,\r\nthe rind of 1/2 lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wipe the rhubarb perfectly dry, take off the string or peel,\r\nand weigh it; put it into a preserving-pan, with sugar in the above\r\nproportion; mince the lemon-rind very finely, add it to the other\r\ningredients, and place the preserving-pan by the side of the fire; keep\r\nstirring to prevent the rhubarb from burning, and when the sugar is well\r\ndissolved, put the pan more over the fire, and let the jam boil until it\r\nis done, taking care to keep it well skimmed and stirred with a wooden\r\nor silver spoon. Pour it into pots, and cover down with oiled and egged\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--If the rhubarb is young and tender, 3/4 hour, reckoning from\r\nthe time it simmers equally; old rhubarb, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 5d. to 7d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--About 1 pint of sliced rhubarb to fill a lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from February to April.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHUBARB AND ORANGE JAM, to resemble Scotch Marmalade.\r\n\r\n1591. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart of finely-cut rhubarb, 6 oranges, 1-1/2 lb.\r\nof loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the oranges; remove as much of the white pith as possible,\r\ndivide them, and take out the pips; slice the pulp into a\r\npreserving-pan, add the rind of half the oranges cut into thin strips,\r\nand the loaf sugar, which should be broken small. Peel the rhubarb, cut\r\nit into thin pieces, put it to the oranges, and stir altogether over a\r\ngentle fire until the jam is done. Remove all the scum as it rises, put\r\nthe preserve into pots, and, when cold, cover down. Should the rhubarb\r\nbe very old, stew it alone for 1/4 hour before the other ingredients are\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3/4 to 1 hour. _Average cost_, from 6d. to 8d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from February to April.\r\n\r\n\r\nRASPBERRY AND CURRANT, or any Fresh Fruit Salad.\r\n\r\n(_A Dessert Dish_.)\r\n\r\n1592. _Mode_.--Fruit salads are made by stripping the fruit from the\r\nstalks, piling it on a dish, and sprinkling over it finely-pounded\r\nsugar. They may be made of strawberries, raspberries, currants, or any\r\nof these fruits mixed; peaches also make a very good salad. After the\r\nsugar is sprinkled over, about 6 large tablespoonfuls of wine or brandy,\r\nor 3 tablespoonfuls of liqueur, should be poured in the middle of the\r\nfruit; and, when the flavour is liked, a little pounded cinnamon may be\r\nadded. In helping the fruit, it should be lightly stirred, that the wine\r\nand sugar may be equally distributed.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient._--1-1/2 pint of fruit, with 3 oz. of pounded sugar, for 4\r\nor 5 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRIES AND CREAM.\r\n\r\n1593. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of picked strawberries allow 1/3 pint\r\nof cream, 2 oz. of finely-pounded sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pick the stalks from the fruit, place it on a glass dish,\r\nsprinkle over it pounded sugar, and slightly stir the strawberries, that\r\nthey may all be equally sweetened; pour the cream over the top, and\r\nserve. Devonshire cream, when it can be obtained, is exceedingly\r\ndelicious for this dish; and, if very thick indeed, may be diluted with\r\na little thin cream or milk.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, with cream at 1s. per pint, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in June and July.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRY JAM.\r\n\r\n1594. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit allow 1/2 pint of red-currant\r\njuice, 1-1/4 lb. of loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Strip the currants from the stalks, put them into a jar; place\r\nthis jar in a saucepan of boiling water, and simmer until the juice is\r\nwell drawn from the fruit; strain the currants, measure the juice, put\r\nit into a preserving-pan, and add the sugar. Select well-ripened but\r\nsound strawberries; pick them from the stalks, and when the sugar is\r\ndissolved in the currant juice, put in the fruit. Simmer the whole over\r\na moderate fire, from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, carefully removing the scum as it\r\nrises. Stir the jam only enough to prevent it from burning at the bottom\r\nof the pan, as the fruit should be preserved as whole as possible. Put\r\nthe jam into jars, and when cold, cover down.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour, reckoning from the time the jam simmers all\r\nover.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, from 7d. to 8d. per lb. pot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient._--12 pints of strawberries will make 12 lb. pots of jam.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in June and July.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVED STRAWBERRIES IN WINE.\r\n\r\n1595. INGREDIENTS.--To every quart bottle allow 1/4 lb. of\r\nfinely-pounded loaf sugar; sherry or Madeira.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the fruit be gathered in fine weather, and used as soon as\r\npicked. Have ready some perfectly dry glass bottles, and some nice soft\r\ncorks or bungs. Pick the stalks from the strawberries, drop them into\r\nthe bottles, sprinkling amongst them pounded sugar in the above\r\nproportion, and when the fruit reaches to the neck of the bottle, fill\r\nup with sherry or Madeira. Cork the bottles down with new corks, and dip\r\nthem into melted resin.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in June or July.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES WHOLE.\r\n\r\n1596. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of fruit allow 1-1/2 lb. of good loaf\r\nsugar, 1 pint of red-currant juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Choose the strawberries not too ripe, of a fine large sort and\r\nof a good colour. Pick off the stalks, lay the strawberries in a dish,\r\nand sprinkle over them half the quantity of sugar, which must be finely\r\npounded. Shake the dish gently, that the sugar may be equally\r\ndistributed and touch the under-side of the fruit, and let it remain for\r\n1 day. Then have ready the currant-juice, drawn as for red-currant jelly\r\nNo. 1533; boil it with the remainder of the sugar until it forms a thin\r\nsyrup, and in this simmer the strawberries and sugar, until the whole is\r\nsufficiently jellied. Great care must be taken not to stir the fruit\r\nroughly, as it should be preserved as whole as possible. Strawberries\r\nprepared in this manner are very good served in glasses and mixed with\r\nthin cream.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour to 20 minutes to simmer the strawberries in the syrup.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in June and July.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE EVERTON TOFFEE.\r\n\r\n1597. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of powdered loaf sugar, 1 teacupful of water,\r\n1/4 lb. of butter, 6 drops of essence of lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the water and sugar into a brass pan, and beat the butter\r\nto a cream. When the sugar is dissolved, add the butter, and keep\r\nstirring the mixture over the fire until it sets, when a little is\r\npoured on to a buttered dish; and just before the toffee is done, add\r\nthe essence of lemon. Butter a dish or tin, pour on it the mixture, and\r\nwhen cool, it will easily separate from the dish. Butter-Scotch, an\r\nexcellent thing for coughs, is made with brown, instead of white sugar,\r\nomitting the water, and flavoured with 1/2 oz. of powdered ginger. It is\r\nmade in the same manner as toffee.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--18 to 35 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make a lb. of toffee.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESSERT DISHES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISH OF NUTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOX OF FRENCH PLUMS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISH OF MIXED FRUIT.]\r\n\r\n1598. The tazza, or dish with stem, the same as that shown in our\r\nillustrations, is now the favourite shape for dessert-dishes. The fruit\r\ncan be arranged and shown to better advantage on these tall high dishes\r\nthan on the short flat ones. All the dishes are now usually placed down\r\nthe centre of the table, dried and fresh fruit alternately, the former\r\nbeing arranged on small round or oval glass plates, and the latter on\r\nthe dishes with stems. The fruit should always be gathered on the same\r\nday that it is required for table, and should be tastefully arranged on\r\nthe dishes, with leaves between and round it. By purchasing fruits that\r\nare in season, a dessert can be supplied at a very moderate cost. These,\r\nwith a few fancy biscuits, crystallized fruit, bon-bons, &c., are\r\nsufficient for an ordinary dessert. When fresh fruit cannot be obtained,\r\ndried and foreign fruits, compotes, baked pears, stewed Normandy\r\npippins, &c. &c., must supply its place, with the addition of preserves,\r\nbon-bons, cakes, biscuits, &c. At fashionable tables, forced fruit is\r\nserved growing in pots, these pots being hidden in more ornamental ones,\r\nand arranged with the other dishes.--(See coloured plate W1.) A few\r\nvases of fresh flowers, tastefully arranged, add very much to the\r\nappearance of the dessert; and, when these are not obtainable, a few\r\npaper ones, mixed with green leaves, answer very well as a substitute.\r\nIn decorating a table, whether for luncheon, dessert, or supper, a vase\r\nor two of flowers should never be forgotten, as they add so much to the\r\nelegance of the _tout ensemble_. In summer and autumn, ladies residing\r\nin the country can always manage to have a few freshly-gathered flowers\r\non their tables, and should never be without this inexpensive luxury. On\r\nthe continent, vases or epergnes filled with flowers are invariably\r\nplaced down the centre of the dinner-table at regular distances. Ices\r\nfor dessert are usually moulded: when this is not the case, they are\r\nhanded round in glasses with wafers to accompany them. Preserved ginger\r\nis frequently handed round after ices, to prepare the palate for the\r\ndelicious dessert wines. A basin or glass of finely-pounded lump sugar\r\nmust never be omitted at a dessert, as also a glass jug of fresh cold\r\nwater (iced, if possible), and two goblets by its side. Grape-scissors,\r\na melon-knife and fork, and nutcrackers, should always be put on table,\r\nif there are dishes of fruit requiring them. Zests are sometimes served\r\nat the close of the dessert; such as anchovy toasts or biscuits. The\r\nFrench often serve plain or grated cheese with a dessert of fresh or\r\ndried fruit. At some tables, finger-glasses are placed at the right of\r\neach person, nearly half filled with cold spring water, and in winter\r\nwith tepid water. These precede the dessert. At other tables, a glass or\r\nvase is simply handed round, filled with perfumed water, into which each\r\nguest dips the corner of his napkin, and, when needful, refreshes his\r\nlips and the tips of his fingers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOX OF CHOCOLATE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISH OF APPLES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALMONDS AND RAISINS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISH OF STRAWBERRIES.]\r\n\r\nAfter the dishes are placed, and every one is provided with plates,\r\nglasses, spoons, &c., the wine should be put at each end of the table,\r\ncooled or otherwise, according to the season. If the party be small, the\r\nwine may be placed only at the top of the table, near the host.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISH OF NUTS.\r\n\r\n1599. These are merely arranged piled high in the centre of the dish, as\r\nshown in the engraving, with or without leaves round the edge. Filberts\r\nshould always be served with the outer skin or husk on them; and walnuts\r\nshould be well wiped with a damp cloth, and then--with a dry one, to\r\nremove the unpleasant sticky feeling the shells frequently have.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Filberts from September to March, good; may be had after\r\nthat time, but are generally shrivelled and dry. Walnuts from September\r\nto January.\r\n\r\n    HAZEL NUT AND FILBERT.--The common Hazel is the wild, and the\r\n    Filbert the cultivated state of the same tree. The hazel is\r\n    found wild, not only in forests and hedges, in dingles and\r\n    ravines, but occurs in extensive tracts in the more northern and\r\n    mountainous parts of the country. It was formerly one of the\r\n    most abundant of those trees which are indigenous in this\r\n    island. It is seldom cultivated as a fruit-tree, though perhaps\r\n    its nuts are superior in flavour to the others. The Spanish nuts\r\n    imported are a superior kind, but they are somewhat oily and\r\n    rather indigestible. Filberts, both the red and the white, and\r\n    the cob-nut, are supposed to be merely varieties of the common\r\n    hazel, which have been produced, partly by the superiority of\r\n    soil and climate, and partly by culture. They were originally\r\n    brought out of Greece to Italy, whence they have found their way\r\n    to Holland, and from that country to England. It is supposed\r\n    that, within a few miles of Maidstone, in Kent, there are more\r\n    filberts grown than in all England besides; and it is from that\r\n    place that the London market is supplied. The filbert is longer\r\n    than the common nut, though of the same thickness, and has a\r\n    larger kernel. The cob-nut is a still larger variety, and is\r\n    roundish. Filberts are more esteemed at the dessert than common\r\n    nuts, and are generally eaten with salt. They are very free from\r\n    oil, and disagree with few persons.\r\n\r\n    WALNUTS.--The Walnut is a native of Persia, the Caucasus, and\r\n    China, but was introduced to this kingdom from France. The ripe\r\n    kernel is brought to the dessert on account of its agreeable\r\n    flavour; and the fruit is also much used in the green state, but\r\n    before the stone hardens, as a pickle. In Spain, grated walnuts\r\n    are employed in tarts and other dishes. The Walnut abounds in\r\n    oil which is expressed and which, being of a highly drying\r\n    nature, and very limpid, is much employed for delicate painting.\r\n    This, on the continent, is sometimes used as a substitute for\r\n    olive-oil in cooking, but is very apt to turn rancid. It is also\r\n    manufactured into a kind of soap. The mare, or refuse matter\r\n    after the oil is extracted, proves very nutritious for poultry\r\n    or other domestic animals. In Switzerland, this is eaten by poor\r\n    people under the name of _pain amer._\r\n\r\nBOX OF FRENCH PLUMS.\r\n\r\n1600. If the box which contains them is exceedingly ornamental, it may\r\nbe placed on the table; if small, on a glass dish; if large, without\r\none, French plums may also be arranged on a glass plate, and garnished\r\nwith bright-coloured sweetmeats, which make a very good effect. All\r\nfancy boxes of preserved and crystallized fruit may be put on the table\r\nor not, at pleasure. These little matters of detail must, of course, be\r\nleft to individual taste.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--May be purchased all the year; but are in greater\r\nperfection in the winter, and are more suitable for that season, as\r\nfresh fruit cannot be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISH OF MIXED FRUIT.\r\n\r\n1601. For a centre dish, a mixture of various fresh fruits has a\r\nremarkably good effect, particularly if a pine be added to the list. A\r\nhigh raised appearance should be given to the fruit, which is done in\r\nthe following manner. Place a tumbler in the centre of the dish, and, in\r\nthis tumbler, the pine, crown uppermost; round the tumbler put a thick\r\nlayer of moss, and, over this, apples, pears, plums, peaches, and such\r\nfruit as is simultaneously in season. By putting a layer of moss\r\nunderneath, so much fruit is not required, besides giving a better shape\r\nto the dish. Grapes should be placed on the top of the fruit, a portion\r\nof some of the bunches hanging over the sides of the dish in a négligé\r\nkind of manner, which takes off the formal look of the dish. In\r\narranging the plums, apples, &c., let the colours contrast well.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Suitable for a dessert in September or October.\r\n\r\n    GRAPES.--France produces about a thousand varieties of the\r\n    grape, which is cultivated more extensively in that country than\r\n    in any other. Hygienists agree in pronouncing grapes as among\r\n    the best of fruits. The grape possesses several rare qualities:\r\n    it is nourishing and fattening, and its prolonged use has often\r\n    overcome the most obstinate cases of constipation. The skins and\r\n    pips of grapes should not be eaten.\r\n\r\nBOX OF CHOCOLATE.\r\n\r\n1602. This is served in an ornamental box, placed on a glass plate or\r\ndish.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--May be purchased at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISH OF APPLES.\r\n\r\n1603. The apples should be nicely wiped with a dry cloth, and arranged\r\non a dish, piled high in the centre, with evergreen leaves between each\r\nlayer. The inferior apples should form the bottom layer, with the\r\nbright-coloured large ones at the top. The leaves of the laurel, bay,\r\nholly, or any shrub green in winter, are suitable for garnishing dessert\r\ndishes. Oranges may be arranged in the same manner; they should also be\r\nwiped with a dry cloth before being sent to table.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISH OF MIXED SUMMER FRUIT.\r\n\r\n1604. This dish consists of cherries, raspberries, currants, and\r\nstrawberries, piled in different layers, with plenty of leaves between\r\neach layer; so that each fruit is well separated. The fruit should be\r\narranged with a due regard to colour, so that they contrast nicely one\r\nwith the other. Our engraving shows a layer of white cherries at the\r\nbottom, then one of red raspberries; over that a layer of white\r\ncurrants, and at the top some fine scarlet strawberries.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in June, July, and August.\r\n\r\n\r\nALMONDS AND RAISINS.\r\n\r\n1605. These are usually served on glass dishes, the fruit piled high in\r\nthe centre, and the almonds blanched, and strewn over. To blanch the\r\nalmonds, put them into a small mug or teacup, pour over them boiling\r\nwater, let them remain for 2 or 3 minutes, and the skins may then be\r\neasily removed. Figs, dates, French plums, &c., are all served on small\r\nglass plates or oval dishes, but without the almonds.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time, but more suitable in winter, when fresh fruit\r\nis not obtainable.\r\n\r\n    DATES.--Dates are imported into Britain, in a dried state, from\r\n    Barbary and Egypt, and, when in good condition, they are much\r\n    esteemed. An inferior kind has lately become common, which are\r\n    dried hard, and have little or no flavour. They should be chosen\r\n    large, softish, not much wrinkled, of a reddish-yellow colour on\r\n    the outside, with a whitish membrane between the fruit and the\r\n    stone.\r\n\r\nDISH OF STRAWBERRIES.\r\n\r\n1606. Fine strawberries, arranged in the manner shown in the engraving,\r\nlook exceedingly well. The inferior ones should be placed at the bottom\r\nof the dish, and the others put in rows pyramidically, with the stalks\r\ndownwards; so that when the whole is completed, nothing but the red part\r\nof the fruit is visible. The fruit should be gathered with rather long\r\nstalks, as there is then something to support it, and it can be placed\r\nmore upright in each layer. A few of the finest should be reserved to\r\ncrown the top.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HAVE WALNUTS FRESH THROUGHOUT THE SEASON.\r\n\r\n1607. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of water allow 1 teaspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Place the walnuts in the salt and water for 24 hours at least;\r\nthen take them out, and rub them dry. Old nuts may be freshened in this\r\nmanner; or walnuts, when first picked, may be put into an earthen pan\r\nwith salt sprinkled amongst them, and with damped hay placed on the top\r\nof them, and then covered down with a lid. They must be well wiped\r\nbefore they are put on table.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Should be stored away in September or October.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON MILK, BUTTER, CHEESE, AND EGGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILK.\r\n\r\n1608. Milk is obtained only from the class of animals called Mammalia,\r\nand is intended by Nature for the nourishment of their young. The milk\r\nof each animal is distinguished by some peculiarities; but as that of\r\nthe cow is by far the most useful to us in this part of the world, our\r\nobservations will be confined to that variety.\r\n\r\n1609. Milk, when drawn from the cow, is of a yellowish-white colour, and\r\nis the most yellow at the beginning of the period of lactation. Its\r\ntaste is agreeable, and rather saccharine. The viscidity and specific\r\ngravity of milk are somewhat greater than that of water; but these\r\nproperties vary somewhat in the milk procured from different\r\nindividuals. On an average, the specific gravity of milk is 1.035, water\r\nbeing 1. The small cows of the Alderney breed afford the richest milk.\r\n\r\n1610. Milk which is carried to a considerable distance, so as to be much\r\nagitated, and cooled before it is put into pans to settle for cream,\r\nnever throws up so much, nor such rich cream, as if the same milk had\r\nbeen put into pans directly after it was milked.\r\n\r\n1611. Milk, considered as an aliment, is of such importance in domestic\r\neconomy as to render all the improvements in its production extremely\r\nvaluable. To enlarge upon the antiquity of its use is unnecessary; it\r\nhas always been a favourite food in Britain. \"Lacte et carno vivunt,\"\r\nsays Caesar, in his Commentaries; the English of which is, \"the\r\ninhabitants subsist upon flesh and milk.\" The breed of the cow has\r\nreceived great improvement in modern times, as regards the quantity and\r\nquality of the milk which she affords; the form of milch-cows, their\r\nmode of nourishment, and progress, are also manifest in the management\r\nof the dairy.\r\n\r\n1612. Although milk in its natural state be a fluid, yet, considered as\r\nan aliment, it is both solid and fluid: for no sooner does it enter the\r\nstomach, than it is coagulated by the gastric juice, and separated into\r\ncurd and whey, the first of these being extremely nutritive.\r\n\r\n1613. Milk of the _human subject_ is much thinner than cow's milk;\r\n_Ass's milk_ comes the nearest to human milk of any other; _Goat's milk_\r\nis something thicker and richer than cow's milk; _Ewe's milk_ has the\r\nappearance of cow's milk, and affords a larger quantity of cream;\r\n_Mare's milk_ contains more sugar than that of the ewe; _Camel's milk_\r\nis used only in Africa; _Buffalo's milk_ is employed in India.\r\n\r\n1614. From no other substance, solid or fluid, can so great a number of\r\ndistinct kinds of aliment be prepared as from milk; some forming food,\r\nothers drink; some of them delicious, and deserving the name of\r\nluxuries; all of them wholesome, and some medicinal: indeed, the variety\r\nof aliments that seems capable of being produced from milk, appears to\r\nbe quite endless. In every age this must have been a subject for\r\nexperiment, and every nation has added to the number by the invention of\r\nsome peculiarity of its own.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTER.\r\n\r\n1615. BECKMAN, in his \"History of Inventions,\" states that butter was\r\nnot used either by the Greeks or Romans in cooking, nor was it brought\r\nupon their tables at certain meals, as is the custom at present. In\r\nEngland it has been made from time immemorial, though the art of making\r\ncheese is said not to have been known to the ancient Britons, and to\r\nhave been learned from their conquerors.\r\n\r\n1616. The taste of butter is peculiar, and very unlike any other fatty\r\nsubstance. It is extremely agreeable when of the best quality; but its\r\nflavour depends much upon the food given to the cows: to be good, it\r\nshould not adhere to the knife.\r\n\r\n1617. Butter, with regard to its dietetic properties, may be regarded\r\nnearly in the light of vegetable oils and animal fats; but it becomes\r\nsooner rancid than most other fat oils. When fresh, it cannot but be\r\nconsidered as very wholesome; but it should be quite free from\r\nrancidity. If slightly salted when it is fresh, its wholesomeness is\r\nprobably not at all impaired; but should it begin to turn rancid,\r\nsalting will not correct its unwholesomeness. When salt butter is put\r\ninto casks, the upper part next the air is very apt to become rancid,\r\nand this rancidity is also liable to affect the whole cask.\r\n\r\n1618. _Epping butter_ is the kind most esteemed in London. _Fresh\r\nbutter_ comes to London from Buckinghamshire, Suffolk, Oxfordshire,\r\nYorkshire, Devonshire, &c. _Cambridge butter_ is esteemed next to fresh;\r\n_Devonshire butter_ is nearly similar in quality to the latter; _Irish\r\nbutter_ sold in London is all salted, but is generally good. The number\r\nof firkins exported annually from Ireland amounts to 420,000, equal to a\r\nmillion of money. _Dutch butter_ is in good repute all over Europe,\r\nAmerica, and even India; and no country in the world is so successful in\r\nthe manufacture of this article, Holland supplying more butter to the\r\nrest of the world than any country whatever.\r\n\r\n1619. There are two methods pursued in the manufacture of butter. In\r\none, the cream is separated from the milk, and in that state it is\r\nconverted into butter by churning, as is the practice about Epping; in\r\nthe other, milk is subjected to the same process, which is the method\r\nusually followed in Cheshire. The first method is generally said to give\r\nthe richest butter, and the latter the largest quantity, though some are\r\nof opinion that there is little difference either in quality or\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE.\r\n\r\n1620. CHEESE is the curd formed from milk by artificial coagulation,\r\npressed and dried for use. Curd, called also casein and caseous matter,\r\nor the basis of cheese, exists in the milk, and not in the cream, and\r\nrequires only to be separated by coagulation. The coagulation, however,\r\nsupposes some alteration of the curd. By means of the substance employed\r\nto coagulate it, it is rendered insoluble in water. When the curd is\r\nfreed from the whey, kneaded and pressed to expel it entirely, it\r\nbecomes cheese. This assumes a degree of transparency, and possesses\r\nmany of the properties of coagulated albumen. If it be well dried, it\r\ndoes not change by exposure to the air; but if it contain moisture, it\r\nsoon putrefies. It therefore requires some salt to preserve it, and this\r\nacts likewise as a kind of seasoning. All our cheese is coloured more or\r\nless, except that made from skim milk. The colouring substances employed\r\nare arnatto, turmeric, or marigold, all perfectly harmless unless they\r\nare adulterated; and it is said that arnatto sometimes contains red\r\nlead.\r\n\r\n1621. Cheese varies in quality and richness according to the materials\r\nof which it is composed. It is made--1. Of entire milk, as in Cheshire;\r\n2. of milk and cream, as at Stilton; 3. of new milk mixed with skimmed\r\nmilk, as in Gloucestershire; 4. of skimmed milk only, as in Suffolk,\r\nHolland, and Italy.\r\n\r\n1622. The principal varieties of cheese used in England are the\r\nfollowing:--_Cheshire cheese_, famed all over Europe for its rich\r\nquality and fine piquant flavour. It is made of entire new milk, the\r\ncream not being taken off. _Gloucester cheese_ is much milder in its\r\ntaste than the Cheshire. There are two kinds of Gloucester\r\ncheese,--single and double. _Single Gloucester_ is made of skimmed milk,\r\nor of the milk deprived of half the cream; _Double Gloucester_ is a\r\ncheese that pleases almost every palate: it is made of the whole milk\r\nand cream. _Stilton cheese_ is made by adding the cream of one day to\r\nthe entire milk of the next: it was first made at Stilton, in\r\nLeicestershire. _Sage cheese_ is so called from the practice of\r\ncolouring some curd with bruised sage, marigold-leaves, and parsley, and\r\nmixing this with some uncoloured curd. With the Romans, and during the\r\nmiddle ages, this practice was extensively adopted. _Cheddar cheese_\r\nmuch resembles Parmesan. It has a very agreeable taste and flavour, and\r\nhas a spongy appearance. _Brickbat cheese_ has nothing remarkable except\r\nits form. It is made by turning with rennet a mixture of cream and new\r\nmilk. The curd is put into a wooden vessel the shape of a brick, and is\r\nthen pressed and dried in the usual way. _Dunlop cheese_ has a\r\npeculiarly mild and rich taste: the best is made entirely from new milk.\r\n_New cheese_ (as it is called in London) is made chiefly in\r\nLincolnshire, and is either made of all cream, or, like Stilton. by\r\nadding the cream of one day's milking to the milk that comes immediately\r\nfrom the cow: they are extremely thin, and are compressed gently two or\r\nthree times, turned for a few days, and then eaten new with radishes,\r\nsalad, &c. _Skimmed Milk cheese_ is made for sea voyages principally.\r\n_Parmesan cheese_ is made in Parma and Piacenza. It is the most\r\ncelebrated of all cheese: it is made entirely of skimmed cow's milk. The\r\nhigh flavour which it has, is supposed to be owing to the rich herbage\r\nof the meadows of the Po, where the cows are pastured. The best Parmesan\r\nis kept for three or four years, and none is carried to market till it\r\nis at least six months old. _Dutch cheese_ derives its peculiar pungent\r\ntaste from the practice adopted in Holland of coagulating the milk with\r\nmuriatic acid instead of rennet. _Swiss cheeses_ in their several\r\nvarieties are all remarkable for their fine flavour. That from\r\n_Gruyère_, a bailiwick in the canton of Fribourg, is best known in\r\nEngland. It is flavoured by the dried herb of _Melilotos officinalis_ in\r\npowder. Cheese from milk and potatoes is manufactured in Thuringia and\r\nSaxony. _Cream cheese_, although so called, is not properly cheese, but\r\nis nothing more than cream dried sufficiently to be cut with a knife.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGGS.\r\n\r\n1623. There is only one opinion as to the nutritive properties of eggs,\r\nalthough the qualities of those belonging to different birds vary\r\nsomewhat. Those of the common hen are most esteemed as delicate food,\r\nparticularly when \"new-laid.\" The quality of eggs depends much upon the\r\nfood given to the hen. Eggs in general are considered most easily\r\ndigestible when little subjected to the art of cookery. The lightest way\r\nof dressing them is by poaching, which is effected by putting them for a\r\nminute or two into brisk boiling water: this coagulates the external\r\nwhite, without doing the inner part too much. Eggs are much better when\r\nnew-laid than a day or two afterwards. The usual time allotted for\r\nboiling eggs in the shell is 3 to 3-3/4 minutes: less time than that in\r\nboiling water will not be sufficient to solidify the white, and more\r\nwill make the yolk hard and less digestible: it is very difficult to\r\n_guess_ accurately as to the time. Great care should be employed in\r\nputting them into the water, to prevent cracking the shell, which\r\ninevitably causes a portion of the white to exude, and lets water into\r\nthe egg. Eggs are often beaten up raw in nutritive beverages.\r\n\r\n1624. Eggs are employed in a very great many articles of cookery,\r\nentrées, and entremets, and they form an essential ingredient in pastry,\r\ncreams, flip, &c. It is particularly necessary that they should be quite\r\nfresh, as nothing is worse than stale eggs. Cobbett justly says, stale,\r\nor even preserved eggs, are things to be run from, not after.\r\n\r\n1625. The Metropolis is supplied with eggs from all parts of the\r\nkingdom, and they are likewise largely imported from various places on\r\nthe continent; as France, Holland, Belgium, Guernsey, and Jersey. It\r\nappears from official statements mentioned in McCulloch's \"Commercial\r\nDictionary,\" that the number imported from France alone amounts to about\r\n60,000,000 a year; and supposing them on an average to cost fourpence a\r\ndozen, it follows that we pay our continental neighbours above £83,000 a\r\nyear for eggs.\r\n\r\n1626. The eggs of different birds vary much in size and colour. Those of\r\nthe ostrich are the largest: one laid in the menagerie in Paris weighed\r\n2 lbs. 14 oz., held a pint, and was six inches deep: this is about the\r\nusual size of those brought from Africa. Travellers describe _ostrich\r\neggs_ as of an agreeable taste: they keep longer than hen's eggs.\r\nDrinking-cups are often made of the shell, which is very strong. The\r\neggs of the _turkey_ are almost as mild as those of the hen; the egg of\r\nthe _goose_ is large, but well-tasted. _Duck's eggs_ have a rich\r\nflavour; the albumen is slightly transparent, or bluish, when set or\r\ncoagulated by boiling, which requires less time than hen's eggs.\r\n_Guinea-fowl eggs_ are smaller and more delicate than those of the hen.\r\nEggs of _wild fowl_ are generally coloured, often spotted; and the taste\r\ngenerally partakes somewhat of the flavour of the bird they belong to.\r\nThose of land birds that are eaten, as the _plover, lapwing, ruff_, &c.,\r\nare in general much esteemed; but those of _sea-fowl_ have, more or\r\nless, a strong fishy taste. The eggs of the _turtle_ are very numerous:\r\nthey consist of yolk only, without shell, and are delicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPARATION OF MILK AND CREAM.\r\n\r\n1627. If it be desired that the milk should be freed entirely from\r\ncream, it should be poured into a very shallow broad pan or dish, not\r\nmore than 1-1/2 inch deep, as cream cannot rise through a great depth of\r\nmilk. In cold and wet weather, milk is not so rich as it is in summer\r\nand warm weather, and the morning's milk is always richer than the\r\nevening's. The last-drawn milk of each milking, at all times and\r\nseasons, is richer than the first-drawn, and on that account should be\r\nset apart for cream. Milk should be shaken as little as possible when\r\ncarried from the cow to the dairy, and should be poured into the pans\r\nvery gently. Persons not keeping cows, may always have a little cream,\r\nprovided the milk they purchase be pure and unadulterated. As soon as it\r\ncomes in, it should be poured into very shallow open pie-dishes, and set\r\nby in a very cool place, and in 7 or 8 hours a nice cream should have\r\nrisen to the surface.\r\n\r\n    MILK is one of the most complete of all articles of food: that\r\n    is to say, it contains a very large number of the elements which\r\n    enter into the composition of the human body. It \"disagrees\"\r\n    with fat, heavy, languid people, of slow circulation; and, at\r\n    first, with many people of sedentary habits, and stomachs\r\n    weakened by stimulants of different kinds. But, if exercise can\r\n    be taken and a little patience shown, while the system\r\n    accommodates itself to a new regimen, this bland and soothing\r\n    article of diet is excellent for the majority of thin, nervous\r\n    people; especially for those who have suffered much from\r\n    emotional disturbances, or have relaxed their stomachs by too\r\n    much tea or coffee, taken too hot. Milk is, in fact, a nutrient\r\n    and a sedative at once. Stomachs, however, have their\r\n    idiosyncrasies, and it sometimes proves an unwelcome and\r\n    ill-digested article of food. As milk, when good, contains a\r\n    good deal of respiratory material (fat),--material which _must_\r\n    either be burnt off, or derange the liver, and be rejected in\r\n    other ways, it may disagree because the lungs are not\r\n    sufficiently used in the open air. But it is very probable that\r\n    there are really \"constitutions\" which cannot take to it; and\r\n    _they_ should not be forced.\r\n\r\nTO KEEP MILK AND CREAM IN HOT WEATHER.\r\n\r\n1628. When the weather is very warm, and it is very difficult to prevent\r\nmilk from turning sour and spoiling the cream, it should be scalded, and\r\nit will then remain good for a few hours. It must on no account be\r\nallowed to boil, or there will be a skin instead of a cream upon the\r\nmilk; and the slower the process, the safer will it be. A very good plan\r\nto scald milk, is to put the pan that contains it into a saucepan or\r\nwide kettle of boiling water. When the surface looks thick, the milk is\r\nsufficiently scalded, and it should then be put away in a cool place in\r\nthe same vessel that it was scalded in. Cream may be kept for 24 hours,\r\nif scalded without sugar; and by the addition of the latter ingredient,\r\nit will remain good double the time, if kept in a cool place. All pans,\r\njugs, and vessels intended for milk, should be kept beautifully clean,\r\nand well scalded before the milk is put in, as any negligence in this\r\nrespect may cause large quantities of it to be spoiled; and milk should\r\nnever be kept in vessels of zinc or copper. Milk may be preserved good\r\nin hot weather, for a few hours, by placing the jug which contains it in\r\nice, or very cold water; or a pinch of bicarbonate of soda may be\r\nintroduced into the liquid.\r\n\r\n    MILK, when of good quality, is of an opaque white colour: the\r\n    cream always comes to the top; the well-known milky odour is\r\n    strong; it will boil without altering its appearance, in these\r\n    respects; the little bladders which arise on the surface will\r\n    renew themselves if broken by the spoon. To boil milk is, in\r\n    fact, the simplest way of testing its quality. The commonest\r\n    adulterations of milk are not of a hurtful character. It is a\r\n    good deal thinned with water, and sometimes thickened with a\r\n    little starch, or colored with yolk of egg, or even saffron; but\r\n    these processes have nothing murderous in them.\r\n\r\nCURDS AND WHEY.\r\n\r\n1629. INGREDIENTS.--A very small piece of rennet, 1/2 gallon of milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure from the butcher's a small piece of rennet, which is\r\nthe stomach of the calf, taken as soon as it is killed, scoured, and\r\nwell rubbed with salt, and stretched on sticks to dry. Pour some boiling\r\nwater on the rennet, and let it remain for 6 hours; then use the liquor\r\nto turn the milk. The milk should be warm and fresh from the cow: if\r\nallowed to cool, it must be heated till it is of a degree quite equal to\r\nnew milk; but do not let it be too hot. About a tablespoonful or rather\r\nmore, would be sufficient to turn the above proportion of milk into\r\ncurds and whey; and whilst the milk is turning, let it be kept in rather\r\na warm place.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 2 to 3 hours to turn the milk.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVONSHIRE CREAM.\r\n\r\n1630. The milk should stand 24 hours in the winter, half that time when\r\nthe weather is very warm. The milkpan is then set on a stove, and should\r\nthere remain until the milk is quite hot; but it must not boil, or there\r\nwill be a thick skin on the surface. When it is sufficiently done, the\r\nundulations on the surface look thick, and small rings appear. The time\r\nrequired for scalding cream depends on the size of the pan and the heat\r\nof the fire; but the slower it is done, the better. The pan should be\r\nplaced in the dairy when the cream is sufficiently scalded, and skimmed\r\nthe following day. This cream is so much esteemed that it is sent to the\r\nLondon markets in small square tins, and is exceedingly delicious eaten\r\nwith fresh fruit. In Devonshire, butter is made from this cream, and is\r\nusually very firm.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVONSHIRE JUNKET.\r\n\r\n1631. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of new milk allow 2 dessertspoonfuls\r\nof brandy, 1 dessertspoonful of sugar, and 1-1/2 dessertspoonful of\r\nprepared rennet; thick cream, pounded cinnamon, or grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the milk blood-warm; put it into a deep dish with the\r\nbrandy, sugar, and rennet; stir it altogether, and cover it over until\r\nit is set. Then spread some thick or clotted cream over the top, grate\r\nsome nutmeg, and strew some sugar over, and the dish will be ready to\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 2 hours to set the milk. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO KEEP AND CHOOSE FRESH BUTTER.\r\n\r\n1632. Fresh butter should be kept in a dark, cool place, and in as large\r\na mass as possible. Mould as much only as is required, as the more\r\nsurface is exposed, the more liability there will be to spoil; and the\r\noutside very soon becomes rancid. Fresh butter should be kept covered\r\nwith white paper. For small larders, butter-coolers of red brick are now\r\nvery much used for keeping fresh butter in warm weather. These coolers\r\nare made with a large bell-shaped cover, into the top of which a little\r\ncold water should be poured, and in summer time very frequently changed;\r\nand the butter must be kept covered. These coolers keep butter\r\nremarkably firm in hot weather, and are extremely convenient for those\r\nwhose larder accommodation is limited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTTER-DISH.]\r\n\r\nIn choosing fresh butter, remember it should smell deliciously, and be\r\nof an equal colour all through: if it smells sour, it has not been\r\nsufficiently washed from the buttermilk; and if veiny and open, it has\r\nprobably been worked with a staler or an inferior sort.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE AND TO CHOOSE SALT BUTTER.\r\n\r\n1633. In large families, where salt butter is purchased a tub at a time,\r\nthe first thing to be done is to turn the whole of the butter out, and,\r\nwith a clean knife, to scrape the outside; the tub should then be wiped\r\nwith a clean cloth, and sprinkled all round with salt, the butter\r\nreplaced, and the lid kept on to exclude the air. It is necessary to\r\ntake these precautions, as sometimes a want of proper cleanliness in the\r\ndairymaid causes the outside of the butter to become rancid, and if the\r\nscraping be neglected, the whole mass would soon become spoiled. To\r\nchoose salt butter, plunge a knife into it, and if, when drawn out, the\r\nblade smells rancid or unpleasant, the butter is bad. The layers in tubs\r\nwill vary greatly, the butter being made at different times; so, to try\r\nif the whole tub be good, the cask should be unhooped, and the butter\r\ntried between the staves.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to state that butter is extracted from cream, or\r\nfrom unskimmed milk, by the churn. Of course it partakes of the\r\nqualities of the milk, and winter butter is said not to be so good as\r\nspring butter.\r\n\r\nA word of caution is necessary about _rancid_ butter. Nobody eats it on\r\nbread, but it is sometimes used in cooking, in forms in which the\r\nacidity can be more or less disguised. So much the worse; it is almost\r\npoisonous, disguise it as you may. Never, under any exigency whatever,\r\nbe tempted into allowing butter with even a _soupçon_ of \"turning\" to\r\nenter into the composition of any dish that appears on your table. And,\r\nin general, the more you can do without the employment of butter that\r\nhas been subjected to the influence of heat, the better. The woman of\r\nmodern times is not a \"leech;\" but she might often keep the \"leech\" from\r\nthe door, if she would give herself the trouble to invent _innocent_\r\nsauces.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTER-MOULDS, for Moulding Fresh Butter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISH OF ROLLED BUTTER.]\r\n\r\n1634. Butter-moulds, or wooden stamps for moulding fresh butter, are\r\nmuch used, and are made in a variety of forms and shapes. In using them,\r\nlet them be kept scrupulously clean, and before the butter is pressed\r\nin, the interior should be well wetted with cold water; the butter must\r\nthen be pressed in, the mould opened, and the perfect shape taken out.\r\nThe butter may be then dished, and garnished with a wreath of parsley,\r\nif for a cheese course; if for breakfast, put it into an ornamental\r\nbutter-dish, with a little water at the bottom, should the weather be\r\nvery warm.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURLED BUTTER.\r\n\r\n1635. Tie a strong cloth by two of the corners to an iron hook in the\r\nwall; make a knot with the other two ends, so that a stick might pass\r\nthrough. Put the butter into the cloth; twist it tightly over a dish,\r\ninto which the butter will fall through the knot, so forming small and\r\npretty little strings. The butter may then be garnished with parsley, if\r\nto serve with a cheese course; or it may be sent to table plain for\r\nbreakfast, in an ornamental dish. Squirted butter for garnishing hams,\r\nsalads, eggs, &c., is made by forming a piece of stiff paper in the\r\nshape of a cornet, and squeezing the butter in fine strings from the\r\nhole at the bottom. Scooped butter is made by dipping a teaspoon or\r\nscooper in warm water, and then scooping the butter quickly and thin. In\r\nwarm weather, it would not be necessary to heat the spoon.\r\n\r\n    BUTTER may be kept fresh for ten or twelve days by a very simple\r\n    process. Knead it well in cold water till the buttermilk is\r\n    extracted; then put it in a glazed jar, which invert in another,\r\n    putting into the latter a sufficient quantity of water to\r\n    exclude the air. Renew the water every day.\r\n\r\nFAIRY BUTTER.\r\n\r\n1636. INGREDIENTS.--The yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, 1 tablespoonful of\r\norange-flower water, 2 tablespoonfuls of pounded sugar, 1/4 lb. of good\r\nfresh butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat the yolks of the eggs smoothly in a mortar, with the\r\norange-flower water and the sugar, until the whole is reduced to a fine\r\npaste; add the butter, and force all through an old but clean cloth by\r\nwringing the cloth and squeezing the butter very hard. The butter will\r\nthen drop on the plate in large and small pieces, according to the holes\r\nin the cloth. Plain butter may be done in the same manner, and is very\r\nquickly prepared, besides having a very good effect.\r\n\r\n    BUTTER.--White-coloured butter is said not to be so good as the\r\n    yellow; but the yellow colour is often artificially produced, by\r\n    the introduction of colouring matter into the churn.\r\n\r\nANCHOVY BUTTER.\r\n\r\n1637. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of butter allow 6 anchovies, 1 small\r\nbunch of parsley.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash, bone, and pound the anchovies well in a mortar; scald the\r\nparsley, chop it, and rub through a sieve; then pound all the\r\ningredients together, mix well, and make the butter into pats\r\nimmediately. This makes a pretty dish, if fancifully moulded, for\r\nbreakfast or supper, and should be garnished with parsley.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 2 dishes, with 4 pats each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE.\r\n\r\n1638. In families where much cheese is consumed, and it is bought in\r\nlarge quantities, a piece from the whole cheese should be cut, the\r\nlarger quantity spread with a thickly-buttered sheet of white paper, and\r\nthe outside occasionally wiped. To keep cheeses moist that are in daily\r\nuse, when they come from table a damp cloth should be wrapped round\r\nthem, and the cheese put into a pan with a cover to it, in a cool but\r\nnot very dry place. To ripen cheeses, and bring them forward, put them\r\ninto a damp cellar; and, to check too large a production of mites,\r\nspirits may be poured into the parts affected. Pieces of cheese which\r\nare too near the rind, or too dry to put on table, may be made into\r\nWelsh rare-bits, or grated down and mixed with macaroni. Cheeses may be\r\npreserved in a perfect state for years, by covering them with parchment\r\nmade pliable by soaking in water, or by rubbing them over with a coating\r\nof melted fat. The cheeses selected should be free from cracks or\r\nbruises of any kind.\r\n\r\n    CHEESE.--It is well known that some persons like cheese in a\r\n    state of decay, and even \"alive.\" There is no accounting for\r\n    tastes, and it maybe hard to show why mould, which is\r\n    vegetation, should not be eaten as well as salad, or maggots as\r\n    well as eels. But, generally speaking, decomposing bodies are\r\n    not wholesome eating, and the line must be drawn somewhere.\r\n\r\nSTILTON CHEESE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STILTON CHEESE.]\r\n\r\n1639. Stilton cheese, or British Parmesan, as it is sometimes called, is\r\ngenerally preferred to all other cheeses by those whose authority few\r\nwill dispute. Those made in May or June are usually served at Christmas;\r\nor, to be in prime order, should be kept from 10 to 12 months, or even\r\nlonger. An artificial ripeness in Stilton cheese is sometimes produced\r\nby inserting a small piece of decayed Cheshire into an aperture at the\r\ntop. From 3 weeks to a month is sufficient time to ripen the cheese. An\r\nadditional flavour may also be obtained by scooping out a piece from the\r\ntop, and pouring therein port, sherry, Madeira, or old ale, and letting\r\nthe cheese absorb these for 2 or 3 weeks. But that cheese is the finest\r\nwhich is ripened without any artificial aid, is the opinion of those who\r\nare judges in these matters. In serving a Stilton cheese, the top of it\r\nshould be cut off to form a lid, and a napkin or piece of white paper,\r\nwith a frill at the top, pinned round. When the cheese goes from table,\r\nthe lid should be replaced.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODE OF SERVING CHEESE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHEESE-GLASS.]\r\n\r\n1640. The usual mode of serving cheese at good tables is to cut a small\r\nquantity of it into neat square pieces, and to put them into a glass\r\ncheese-dish, this dish being handed round. Should the cheese crumble\r\nmuch, of course this method is rather wasteful, and it may then be put\r\non the table in the piece, and the host may cut from it. When served\r\nthus, the cheese must always be carefully scraped, and laid on a white\r\nd'oyley or napkin, neatly folded. Cream cheese is often served in a\r\ncheese course, and, sometimes, grated Parmesan: the latter should he put\r\ninto a covered glass dish. Rusks, cheese-biscuits, pats or slices of\r\nbutter, and salad, cucumber, or water-cresses, should always form part\r\nof a cheese course.\r\n\r\n    SMOKING CHEESES.--The Romans smoked their cheeses, to give them\r\n    a sharp taste. They possessed public places expressly for this\r\n    use, and subject to police regulations which no one could evade.\r\n\r\n    A celebrated gourmand remarked that a dinner without cheese is\r\n    like a woman with one eye.\r\n\r\nCHEESE SANDWICHES.\r\n\r\n1641. INGREDIENTS.--Slices of brown bread-and-butter, thin slices of\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut from a nice fat Cheshire, or any good rich cheese, some\r\nslices about 1/2 inch thick, and place them between some slices of brown\r\nbread-and-butter, like sandwiches. Place them on a plate in the oven,\r\nand, when the bread is toasted, serve on a napkin very hot and very\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes in a brisk oven.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1-1/2d. each sandwich.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow a sandwich for each person.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    CHEESE.--One of the most important products of coagulated milk\r\n    is cheese. Unfermented, or cream-cheese, when quite fresh, is\r\n    good for subjects with whom milk does not disagree; but cheese,\r\n    in its commonest shape, is only fit for sedentary people as an\r\n    after-dinner stimulant, and in very small quantity. Bread and\r\n    cheese, as a meal, is only fit for soldiers on march or\r\n    labourers in the open air, who like it because it \"holds the\r\n    stomach a long time.\"\r\n\r\nCAYENNE CHEESES.\r\n\r\n1642. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of butter, 1/2 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of\r\ngrated cheese, 1/3 teaspoonful of cayenne, 1/3 teaspoonful of salt;\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the butter in the flour; add the grated cheese, cayenne.\r\nand salt; and mix these ingredients well together. Moisten with\r\nsufficient water to make the whole into a paste; roll out, and cut into\r\nfingers about 4 inches in length. Bake them in a moderate oven a very\r\nlight colour, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 to 20 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE A FONDUE.\r\n\r\n1643. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, the weight of 2 in Parmesan or good Cheshire\r\ncheese, the weight of 2 in butter; pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs; beat the former\r\nin a basin, and grate the cheese, or cut it into _very thin_ flakes.\r\nParmesan or Cheshire cheese may be used, whichever is the most\r\nconvenient, although the former is considered more suitable for this\r\ndish; or an equal quantity of each may be used. Break the butter into\r\nsmall pieces, add it to the other ingredients, with sufficient pepper\r\nand salt to season nicely, and beat the mixture thoroughly. Well whisk\r\nthe whites of the eggs, stir them lightly in, and either bake the fondue\r\nin a soufflé-dish or small round cake-tin. Fill the dish only half full,\r\nas the fondue should rise very much. Pin a napkin round the tin or dish,\r\nand serve very hot and very quickly. If allowed to stand after it is\r\nwithdrawn from the oven, the beauty and lightness of this preparation\r\nwill be entirely spoiled.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 15 to 20 minutes. _Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRILLAT SAVARIN'S FONDUE.\r\n\r\n(_An excellent Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n1644. INGREDIENTS.--Eggs, cheese, butter, pepper and salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Take the same number of eggs as there are guests; weigh the\r\neggs in the shell, allow a third of their weight in Gruyère cheese, and\r\na piece of butter one-sixth of the weight of the cheese. Break the eggs\r\ninto a basin, beat them well; add the cheese, which should be grated,\r\nand the butter, which should be broken into small pieces. Stir these\r\ningredients together with a wooden spoon; put the mixture into a lined\r\nsaucepan, place it over the fire, and stir until the substance is thick\r\nand soft. Put in a little salt, according to the age of the cheese, and\r\na good sprinkling of pepper, and serve the fondue on a very hot silver\r\nor metal plate. Do not allow the fondue to remain on the fire after the\r\nmixture is set, as, if it boils, it will be entirely spoiled. Brillat\r\nSavarin recommends that some choice Burgundy should he handed round with\r\nthis dish. We have given this recipe exactly as he recommends it to be\r\nmade; but we have tried it with good Cheshire cheese, and found it\r\nanswer remarkably well.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 4 minutes to set the mixture.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for 4 persons, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 egg, with the other ingredients in proportion,\r\nfor one person.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACARONI, as usually served with the CHEESE COURSE.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n1645. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of pipe macaroni, 1/4 lb. of butter, 6 oz.\r\nof Parmesan or Cheshire cheese, pepper and salt to taste, 1 pint of\r\nmilk, 2 pints of water, bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk and water into a saucepan with sufficient salt to\r\nflavour it; place it on the fire, and, when it boils quickly, drop in\r\nthe macaroni. Keep the water boiling until it is quite tender; drain the\r\nmacaroni, and put it into a deep dish. Have ready the grated cheese,\r\neither Parmesan or Cheshire; sprinkle it amongst the macaroni and some\r\nof the butter cut into small pieces, reserving some of the cheese for\r\nthe top layer. Season with a little pepper, and cover the top layer of\r\ncheese with some very fine bread crumbs. Warm, without oiling, the\r\nremainder of the butter, and pour it gently over the bread crumbs. Place\r\nthe dish before a bright fire to brown the crumbs; turn it once or\r\ntwice, that it may be equally coloured, and serve very hot. The top of\r\nthe macaroni may be browned with a salamander, which is even better than\r\nplacing it before the fire, as the process is more expeditious; but it\r\nshould never be browned in the oven, as the butter would oil, and so\r\nimpart a very disagreeable flavour to the dish. In boiling the macaroni,\r\nlet it be perfectly tender but firm, no part beginning to melt, and the\r\nform entirely preserved. It may be boiled in plain water, with a little\r\nsalt instead of using milk, but should then have a small piece of butter\r\nmixed with it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hour to boil the macaroni, 5 minutes to brown it\r\nbefore the fire.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Riband macaroni may be dressed in the same manner, but does not\r\nrequire boiling so long a time.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n1646. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of pipe or riband macaroni, 1/2 pint of\r\nmilk, 1/2 pint of veal or beef gravy, the yolks of 2 eggs, 4\r\ntablespoonfuls of cream, 3 oz. of grated Parmesan or Cheshire cheese, 1\r\noz. of butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the macaroni, and boil it in the gravy and milk until\r\nquite tender, without being broken. Drain it, and put it into rather a\r\ndeep dish. Beat the yolks of the eggs with the cream and 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of the liquor the macaroni was boiled in; make this\r\nsufficiently hot to thicken, but do not allow it to boil; pour it over\r\nthe macaroni, over which sprinkle the grated cheese and the butter\r\nbroken into small pieces; brown with a salamander, or before the fire,\r\nand serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hour to boil the macaroni, 5 minutes to thicken\r\nthe eggs and cream, 5 minutes to brown.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n1647. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of pipe macaroni, 1/2 pint of brown gravy\r\nNo. 436, 6 oz. of grated Parmesan cheese.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the macaroni, and boil it in salt and water until quite\r\ntender; drain it, and put it into rather a deep dish. Have ready a pint\r\nof good brown gravy, pour it hot over the macaroni, and send it to table\r\nwith grated Parmesan served on a separate dish. When the flavour is\r\nliked, a little pounded mace may be added to the water in which the\r\nmacaroni is boiled; but this must always be sparingly added, as it will\r\nimpart a very strong flavour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hour to boil the macaroni.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with the gravy and cheese, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOUNDED CHEESE.\r\n\r\n1648. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of cheese allow 3 oz. of fresh butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--To pound cheese is an economical way of using it, if it has\r\nbecome dry; it is exceedingly good spread on bread, and is the best way\r\nof eating it for those whose digestion is weak. Cut up the cheese into\r\nsmall pieces, and pound it smoothly in a mortar, adding butter in the\r\nabove proportion. Press it down into a jar, cover with clarified butter,\r\nand it will keep for several days. The flavour may be very much\r\nincreased by adding mixed mustard (about a teaspoonful to every lb.), or\r\ncayenne, or pounded mace. Curry-powder is also not unfrequently mixed\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAMAKINS, to serve with the CHEESE COURSE.\r\n\r\n1649. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of Cheshire cheese, 1/4 lb. of Parmesan\r\ncheese, 1/4 lb. of fresh butter, 4 eggs, the crumb of a small roll;\r\npepper, salt, and pounded mace to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the crumb of the roll in milk for 5 minutes; strain, and\r\nput it into a mortar; add the cheese, which should be finely scraped,\r\nthe butter, the yolks of the eggs, and seasoning, and pound these\r\ningredients well together. Whisk the whites of the eggs, mix them with\r\nthe paste, and put it into small pans or saucers, which should not be\r\nmore than half filled. Bake them from 10 to 12 minutes, and serve them\r\nvery hot and very quickly. This batter answers equally well for macaroni\r\nafter it is boiled tender.\r\n\r\n_Time_--10 to 12 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 7 or 8 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASTRY RAMAKINS, to serve with the CHEESE COURSE.\r\n\r\n1650. INGREDIENTS.--Any pieces of very good light puff-paste Cheshire,\r\nParmesan, or Stilton cheese.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--The remains or odd pieces of paste left from large tarts, &c.\r\nanswer for making these little dishes. Gather up the pieces of paste,\r\nroll it out evenly, and sprinkle it with grated cheese of a nice\r\nflavour. Fold the paste in three, roll it out again, and sprinkle more\r\ncheese over; fold the paste, roll it out, and with a paste-cutter shape\r\nit in any way that may be desired. Bake the ramakins in a brisk oven\r\nfrom 10 to 15 minutes, dish them on a hot napkin, and serve quickly. The\r\nappearance of this dish may be very much improved by brushing the\r\nramakins over with yolk of egg before they are placed in the oven. Where\r\nexpense is not objected to, Parmesan is the best kind of cheese to use\r\nfor making this dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes. _Average cost_, with 1/2 lb. of paste, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 6 or 7 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOASTED CHEESE, or SCOTCH RARE-BIT.\r\n\r\n1651. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of rich cheese, toast, mustard, and\r\npepper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOT-WATER CHEESE-DISH.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut some nice rich sound cheese into rather thin slices; melt\r\nit in a cheese-toaster on a hot plate, or over steam, and, when melted,\r\nadd a small quantity of mixed mustard and a seasoning of pepper; stir\r\nthe cheese until it is completely dissolved, then brown it before the\r\nfire, or with a salamander. Fill the bottom of the cheese-toaster with\r\nhot water, and serve with dry or buttered toasts, whichever may be\r\npreferred. Our engraving illustrates a cheese-toaster with hot-water\r\nreservoir: the cheese is melted in the upper tin, which is placed in\r\nanother vessel of boiling water, so keeping the preparation beautifully\r\nhot. A small quantity of porter, or port wine, is sometimes mixed with\r\nthe cheese; and, if it be not very rich, a few pieces of butter may be\r\nmixed with it to great advantage. Sometimes the melted cheese is spread\r\non the toasts, and then laid in the cheese-dish at the top of the hot\r\nwater. Whichever way it is served, it is highly necessary that the\r\nmixture be very hot, and very quickly sent to table, or it will be\r\nworthless.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 5 minutes to melt the cheese.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1-1/2d. per slice.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow a slice to each person. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOASTED CHEESE, or WELSH RARE-BIT.\r\n\r\n1652. INGREDIENTS.--Slices of bread, butter, Cheshire or Gloucester\r\ncheese, mustard, and pepper.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the bread into slices about 1/2 inch in thickness; pare off\r\nthe crust, toast the bread slightly without hardening or burning it, and\r\nspread it with butter. Cut some slices, not quite so large as the bread,\r\nfrom a good rich fat cheese; lay them on the toasted bread in a\r\ncheese-toaster; be careful that the cheese does not burn, and let it be\r\nequally melted. Spread over the top a little made mustard and a\r\nseasoning of pepper, and serve very hot, with very hot plates. To\r\nfacilitate the melting of the cheese, it may be cut into thin flakes or\r\ntoasted on one side before it is laid on the bread. As it is so\r\nessential to send this dish hot to table, it is a good plan to melt the\r\ncheese in small round silver or metal pans, and to send these pans to\r\ntable, allowing one for each guest. Slices of dry or buttered toast\r\nshould always accompany them, with mustard, pepper, and salt.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 5 minutes to melt the cheese.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1-1/2d. each slice.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow a slice to each person. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Should the cheese be dry, a little butter mixed with it will be\r\nan improvement.\r\n\r\n    \"COW CHEESE.\"--It was only fifty years after Aristotle--the\r\n    fourth century before Christ--that butter began to be noticed as\r\n    an aliment. The Greeks, in imitation of the Parthians and\r\n    Scythians, who used to send it to them, had it served upon their\r\n    tables, and called it at first \"oil of milk,\" and later,\r\n    _bouturos_, \"cow cheese.\"\r\n\r\nSCOTCH WOODCOCK.\r\n\r\n1653. INGREDIENTS.--A few slices of hot buttered toast; allow 1 anchovy\r\nto each slice. For the sauce,--1/4 pint of cream, the yolks of 3 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs; beat the\r\nformer, stir to them the cream, and bring the sauce to the\r\nboiling-point, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle. Have\r\nready some hot buttered toast, spread with anchovies pounded to a paste;\r\npour a little of the hot sauce on the top, and serve very hot and very\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes to make the sauce hot.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1/2 slice to each person. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHOOSE EGGS.\r\n\r\n1654. In choosing eggs, apply the tongue to the large end of the egg,\r\nand, if it feels warm, it is new, and may be relied on as a fresh egg.\r\nAnother mode of ascertaining their freshness is to hold them before a\r\nlighted candle, or to the light, and if the egg looks clear, it will be\r\ntolerably good; if thick, it is stale; and if there is a black spot\r\nattached to the shell, it is worthless. No egg should be used for\r\nculinary purposes with the slightest taint in it, as it will render\r\nperfectly useless those with which it has been mixed. Eggs that are\r\npurchased, and that cannot be relied on, should always be broken in a\r\ncup, and then put into a basin: by this means stale or bad eggs may be\r\neasily rejected, without wasting the others.\r\n\r\n    EGGS contain, for their volume, a greater quantity of nutriment\r\n    than any other article of food. But it does not follow that they\r\n    are always good for weak stomachs; quite the contrary; for it is\r\n    often a great object to give the stomach a large surface to work\r\n    upon, a considerable volume of _ingesta_, over which the\r\n    nutritive matter is diffused, and so exposed to the action of\r\n    the gastric juice at many points. There are many persons who\r\n    cannot digest eggs, however cooked. It is said, however, that\r\n    their digestibility decreases in proportion to the degree in\r\n    which they are hardened by boiling.\r\n\r\nTO KEEP EGGS FRESH FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.\r\n\r\n1655. Have ready a large saucepan, capable of holding 3 or 4 quarts,\r\nfull of boiling water. Put the eggs into a cabbage-net, say 20 at a\r\ntime, and hold them in the water (which must be kept boiling) _for_ 20\r\n_seconds_. Proceed in this manner till you have done as many eggs as you\r\nwish to preserve; then pack them away in sawdust. We have tried this\r\nmethod of preserving eggs, and can vouch for its excellence: they will\r\nbe found, at the end of 2 or 3 months, quite good enough for culinary\r\npurposes; and although the white may be a little tougher than that of a\r\nnew-laid egg, the yolk will be nearly the same. Many persons keep eggs\r\nfor a long time by smearing the shells with butter or sweet oil: they\r\nshould then be packed in plenty of bran or sawdust, and the eggs not\r\nallowed to touch each other. Eggs for storing should be collected in\r\nfine weather, and should not be more than 24 hours old when they are\r\npacked away, or their flavour, when used, cannot be relied on. Another\r\nsimple way of preserving eggs is to immerse them in lime-water soon\r\nafter they have been laid, and then to put the vessel containing the\r\nlime-water in a cellar or cool outhouse.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--The best time for preserving eggs is from July to\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n    EGGS.--The quality of eggs is said to be very much affected by\r\n    the food of the fowls who lay them. Herbs and grain together\r\n    make a better food than grain only. When the hens eat too many\r\n    insects, the eggs have a disagreeable flavour.\r\n\r\nTO BOIL EGGS FOR BREAKFAST, SALADS, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGG-STAND FOR THE BREAKFAST-TABLE.]\r\n\r\n1656. Eggs for boiling cannot be too fresh, or boiled too soon after\r\nthey are laid; but rather a longer time should be allowed for boiling a\r\nnew-laid egg than for one that is three or four days old. Have ready a\r\nsaucepan of boiling water; put the eggs into it gently with a spoon,\r\nletting the spoon touch the bottom of the saucepan before it is\r\nwithdrawn, that the egg may not fall, and consequently crack. For those\r\nwho like eggs lightly boiled, 3 minutes will be found sufficient; 3-3/4\r\nto 4 minutes will be ample time to set the white nicely; and, if liked\r\nhard, 6 to 7 minutes will not be found too long. Should the eggs be\r\nunusually large, as those of black Spanish fowls sometimes are, allow an\r\nextra 1/2 minute for them. Eggs for salads should be boiled from 10\r\nminutes to 1/4 hour, and should be placed in a basin of cold water for a\r\nfew minutes; they should then be rolled on the table with the hand, and\r\nthe shell will peel off easily.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To boil eggs lightly, for invalids or children, 3 minutes; to\r\nboil eggs to suit the generality of tastes, 3-3/4 to 4 minutes; to boil\r\neggs hard, 6 to 7 minutes; for salads, 10 to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Silver or plated egg-dishes, like that shown in our engraving,\r\nare now very much used. The price of the one illustrated is £2. 2s., and\r\nmay be purchased of Messrs. R. & J. Slack, 336, Strand.\r\n\r\n    EGGS.--When fresh eggs are dropped into a vessel _full_ of\r\n    boiling water, they crack, because the eggs being well filled,\r\n    the shells give way to the efforts of the interior fluids,\r\n    dilated by heat. If the volume of hot water be small, the shells\r\n    do not crack, because its temperature is reduced by the eggs\r\n    before the interior dilation can take place. Stale eggs, again,\r\n    do not crack, because the air inside is easily compressed.\r\n\r\nBUTTERED EGGS.\r\n\r\n1657. INGREDIENTS.--4 new-laid eggs, 2 oz. of butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Procure the eggs new-laid if possible; break them into a basin,\r\nand beat them well; put the butter into another basin, which place in\r\nboiling water, and stir till the butter is melted. Pour that and the\r\neggs into a lined saucepan; hold it over a gentle fire, and, as the\r\nmixture begins to warm, pour it two or three times into the basin, and\r\nback again, that the two ingredients may be well incorporated. Keep\r\nstirring the eggs and butter one way until they are hot, _without\r\nboiling_, and serve on hot buttered toast. If the mixture is allowed to\r\nboil, it will curdle, and so be entirely spoiled.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 5 minutes to make the eggs hot. _Average cost_, 7d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow a slice to each person. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUCKS' EGGS.\r\n\r\n1658. Ducks' eggs are usually so strongly flavoured that, plainly\r\nboiled, they are not good for eating; they answer, however, very well\r\nfor various culinary preparations where eggs are required; such as\r\ncustards, &c. &c. Being so large and highly-flavoured, 1 duck's egg will\r\ngo as far as 2 small hen's eggs; besides making whatever they are mixed\r\nwith exceedingly rich. They also are admirable when used in puddings.\r\n\r\n    PRIMITIVE METHOD OF COOKING EGGS.--The shepherds of Egypt had a\r\n    singular manner of cooking eggs without the aid of fire. They\r\n    placed them in a sling, which they turned so rapidly that the\r\n    friction of the air heated them to the exact point required for\r\n    use.\r\n\r\nFRIED EGGS.\r\n\r\n1659. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1/4 lb. of lard, butter or clarified\r\ndripping.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRIED EGGS ON BACON.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Place a delicately-clean frying-pan over a gentle fire; put in\r\nthe fat, and allow it to come to the boiling-point. Break the eggs into\r\ncups, slip them into the boiling fat, and let them remain until the\r\nwhites are delicately set; and, whilst they are frying, ladle a little\r\nof the fat over them. Take them up with a slice, drain them for a minute\r\nfrom their greasy moisture, trim them neatly, and serve on slices of\r\nfried bacon or ham; or the eggs may be placed in the middle of the dish,\r\nwith the bacon put round as a garnish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 to 3 minutes. Average cost, 1d. each; 2d. when scarce.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    VENERATION FOR EGGS.--Many of the most learned philosophers held\r\n    eggs in a kind of respect, approaching to veneration, because\r\n    they saw in them the emblem of the world and the four elements.\r\n    The shell, they said, represented the earth; the white, water;\r\n    the yolk, fire; and air was found under the shell at one end of\r\n    the egg.\r\n\r\nEGGS A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL.\r\n\r\n1660. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of fresh butter, 1 tablespoonful of flour,\r\n1/2 pint of milk, pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of minced\r\nparsley, the juice of 1/2 lemon, 6 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the flour and half the butter into a stewpan; stir them\r\nover the fire until the mixture thickens; pour in the milk, which should\r\nbe boiling; add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and simmer the whole for\r\n5 minutes. Put the remainder of the butter into the sauce, and add the\r\nminced parsley; then boil the eggs hard, strip off the shells, cut the\r\neggs into quarters, and put them on a dish. Bring the sauce to the\r\nboiling-point, add the lemon-juice, pour over the eggs, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes to boil the sauce; the eggs, 10 to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 4 or 5 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nOEUFS AU PLAT, or AU MIROIR, served on the Dish in which they are\r\nCooked.\r\n\r\n1661. INGREDIENTS.--4 eggs, 1 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Butter a dish rather thickly with good fresh butter; melt it,\r\nbreak the eggs into it the same as for poaching, sprinkle them with\r\nwhite pepper and fine salt, and put the remainder of the butter, cut\r\ninto very small pieces, on the top of them. Put the dish on a hot plate,\r\nor in the oven, or before the fire, and let it remain until the whites\r\nbecome set, but not hard, when serve immediately, placing the dish they\r\nwere cooked in on another. To hasten the cooking of the eggs, a\r\nsalamander may be held over them for a minute; but great care must be\r\ntaken that they are not too much done. This is an exceedingly nice dish,\r\nand one very easily prepared for breakfast.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 minutes. _Average cost_, 5d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLOVERS' EGGS.\r\n\r\n1662. Plovers' eggs are usually served boiled hard, and sent to table in\r\na napkin, either hot or cold. They may also be shelled, and served the\r\nsame as eggs à la Tripe, with a good Béchamel sauce, or brown gravy,\r\npoured over them. They are also used for decorating salads, the\r\nbeautiful colour of the white being generally so much admired.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOACHED EGGS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGGS POACHED ON TOAST.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIN EGG-POACHER.]\r\n\r\n1663. INGREDIENTS.--Eggs, water. To every pint of water allow 1\r\ntablespoonful of vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Eggs for poaching should be perfectly fresh, but not quite\r\nnew-laid; those that are about 36 hours old are the best for the\r\npurpose. If quite new-laid, the white is so milky it is almost\r\nimpossible to set it; and, on the other hand, if the egg be at all\r\nstale, it is equally difficult to poach it nicely. Strain some boiling\r\nwater into a deep clean frying-pan; break the egg into a cup without\r\ndamaging the yolk, and, when the water boils, remove the pan to the side\r\nof the fire, and gently slip the egg into it. Place the pan over a\r\ngentle fire, and keep the water simmering until the white looks nicely\r\nset, when the egg is ready. Take it up gently with a slice, cut away the\r\nragged edges of the white, and serve either on toasted bread or on\r\nslices of ham or bacon, or on spinach, &c. A poached egg should not be\r\noverdone, as its appearance and taste will be quite spoiled if the yolk\r\nbe allowed to harden. When the egg is slipped into the water, the white\r\nshould be gathered together, to keep it a little in form, or the cup\r\nshould be turned over it for 1 minute. To poach an egg to perfection is\r\nrather a difficult operation; so, for inexperienced cooks, a tin\r\negg-poacher may be purchased, which greatly facilitates this manner of\r\ndressing ecgs. Our illustration clearly shows what it is: it consists of\r\na tin plate with a handle, with a space for three perforated cups. An\r\negg should be broken into each cup, and the machine then placed in a\r\nstewpan of boiling water, which has been previously strained. When the\r\nwhites of the eggs appear set, they are done, and should then be\r\ncarefully slipped on to the toast or spinach, or with whatever they are\r\nserved. In poaching eggs in a frying-pan, never do more than four at a\r\ntime; and, when a little vinegar is liked mixed with the water in which\r\nthe eggs are done, use the above proportion.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2-1/2 to 3-1/2 minutes, according to the size of the egg.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 2 eggs to each person.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time, but less plentiful in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOACHED EGGS, WITH CREAM.\r\n\r\n1664. INGREDIENTS.--1 pint of water, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 4\r\nteaspoonfuls of vinegar, 4 fresh eggs, 1/2 gill of cream, salt, pepper,\r\nand pounded sugar to taste, 1 oz. of butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the water, vinegar, and salt into a frying-pan, and break\r\neach egg into a separate cup; bring the water, &c. to boil, and slip the\r\neggs gently into it without breaking the yolks. Simmer them from 3 to 4\r\nminutes, but not longer, and, with a slice, lift them out on to a hot\r\ndish, and trim the edges. Empty the pan of its contents, put in the\r\ncream, add a seasoning to taste of pepper, salt, and pounded sugar;\r\nbring the whole to the boiling-point; then add the butter, broken into\r\nsmall pieces; toss the pan round and round till the butter is melted;\r\npour it over the eggs, and serve. To insure the eggs not being spoiled\r\nwhilst the cream, &c., is preparing, it is a good plan to warm the cream\r\nwith the butter, &c., before the eggs are poached, so that it may be\r\npoured over them immediately after they are dished.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 to 4 minutes to poach the eggs, 5 minutes to warm the cream.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for the above quantity, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 2 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n1665. COMPARATIVE SIZES OF EGGS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1 SWAN'S EGG. 2 TURKEY'S EGG. 3 DUCK'S EGG. 4 PLOVER'S\r\nEGG.]\r\n\r\nSCOTCH EGGS.\r\n\r\n1666. INGREDIENTS.--6 eggs, 6 tablespoonfuls of forcemeat No. 417, hot\r\nlard, 1/2 pint of good brown gravy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the eggs for 10 minutes; strip them from the shells, and\r\ncover them with forcemeat made by recipe No. 417; or substitute pounded\r\nanchovies for the ham. Fry the eggs a nice brown in boiling lard, drain\r\nthem before the fire from their greasy moisture, dish them, and pour\r\nround from 1/4 to 1/2 pint of good brown gravy. To enhance the\r\nappearance of the eggs, they may be rolled in beaten egg and sprinkled\r\nwith bread crumbs; but this is scarcely necessary if they are carefully\r\nfried. The flavour of the ham or anchovy in the forcemeat must\r\npreponderate, as it should be very relishing.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the eggs, 5 to 7 minutes to fry them.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 4d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 persons. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGGS A LA TRIPE.\r\n\r\n1667. INGREDIENTS.--8 eggs, 3/4 pint of Béchamel sauce No. 368,\r\ndessertspoonful of finely-minced parsley.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the eggs hard; put them into cold water, peel them, take\r\nout the yolks whole, and shred the whites. Make 3/4 pint of Béchamel\r\nsauce by recipe No. 368; add the parsley, and, when the sauce is quite\r\nhot, put the yolks of the eggs into the middle of the dish, and the\r\nshred whites round them; pour over the sauce, and garnish with leaves of\r\npuff-paste or fried croûtons. There is no necessity for putting the eggs\r\ninto the saucepan with the Béchamel; the sauce, being quite hot, will\r\nwarm the eggs sufficiently.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes to boil the eggs.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 5 or 6 persons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON BREAD, BISCUITS, AND CAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAD AND BREAD-MAKING.\r\n\r\n1668. AMONG the numerous vegetable products yielding articles of food\r\nfor man, the Cereals hold the first place. By means of skilful\r\ncultivation, mankind have transformed the original forms of these\r\ngrowths, poor and ill-flavoured as they perhaps were, into various\r\nfruitful and agreeable species, which yield an abundant and pleasant\r\nsupply. Classified according to their respective richness in alimentary\r\nelements, the Cereals stand thus:--Wheat, and its varieties, Rye,\r\nBarley, Oats, Rice, Indian Corn. Everybody knows it is wheat flour which\r\nyields the best bread. Rye-bread is viscous, hard, less easily soluble\r\nby the gastric juice, and not so rich in nutritive power. Flour produced\r\nfrom barley, Indian corn, or rice, is not so readily made into bread;\r\nand the article, when made, is heavy and indigestible.\r\n\r\n1669. On examining a grain of corn from any of the numerous cereals\r\n[Footnote: _Cereal,_ a corn-producing plant; from Ceres, the goddess of\r\nagriculture.] used in the preparation of flour, such as wheat, maize,\r\nrye, barley, &c., it will be found to consist of two parts,--the husk,\r\nor exterior covering, which is generally of a dark colour, and the\r\ninner, or albuminous part, which is more or less white. In grinding,\r\nthese two portions are separated, and the husk being blown away in the\r\nprocess of winnowing, the flour remains in the form of a light brown\r\npowder, consisting principally of starch and gluten. In order to render\r\nit white, it undergoes a process called \"bolting.\" It is passed through\r\na series of fine sieves, which separate the coarser parts, leaving\r\nbehind fine white flour,--the \"fine firsts\" of the corn-dealer. The\r\nprocess of bolting, as just described, tends to deprive flour of its\r\ngluten, the coarser and darker portion containing much of that\r\nsubstance; while the lighter part is peculiarly rich in starch. Bran\r\ncontains a large proportion of gluten; hence it will be seen why brown\r\nbroad is so much more nutritious than white; in fact, we may lay it down\r\nas a general rule, that the whiter the bread the less nourishment it\r\ncontains. Majendie proved this by feeding a dog for forty days with\r\nwhite wheaten bread, at the end of which time he died; while another\r\ndog, fed on brown bread made with flour mixed with bran, lived without\r\nany disturbance of his health. The \"bolting\" process, then, is rather\r\ninjurious than beneficial in its result; and is one of the numerous\r\ninstances where fashion has chosen a wrong standard to go by. In ancient\r\ntimes, down to the Emperors, no bolted flour was known. In many parts of\r\nGermany the entire meal is used; and in no part of the world are the\r\ndigestive organs of the people in a better condition. In years of\r\nfamine, when corn is scarce, the use of bolted flour is most culpable,\r\nfor from 18 to 20 per cent, is lost in bran. Brown bread has, of late\r\nyears, become very popular; and many physicians have recommended it to\r\ninvalids with weak digestions with great success. This rage for white\r\nbread has introduced adulterations of a very serious character,\r\naffecting the health of the whole community. Potatoes are added for this\r\npurpose; but this is a comparatively harmless cheat, only reducing the\r\nnutritive property of the bread; but bone-dust and alum are also put in,\r\nwhich are far from harmless.\r\n\r\n1670. Bread-making is a very ancient art indeed. The Assyrians,\r\nEgyptians, and Greeks, used to make bread, in which oil, with aniseed\r\nand other spices, was an element; but this was unleavened. Every family\r\nused to prepare the bread for its own consumption, the _trade_ of baking\r\nnot having yet taken shape. It is said, that somewhere about the\r\nbeginning of the thirtieth Olympiad, the slave of an archon, at Athens,\r\nmade leavened bread by accident. He had left some wheaten dough in an\r\nearthen pan, and forgotten it; some days afterwards, he lighted upon it\r\nagain, and found it turning sour. His first thought was to throw it\r\naway; but, his master coming up, he mixed this now acescent dough with\r\nsome fresh dough, which he was working at. The bread thus produced, by\r\nthe introduction of dough in which alcoholic fermentation had begun, was\r\nfound delicious by the archon and his friends; and the slave, being\r\nsummoned and catechised, told the secret. It spread all over Athens; and\r\neverybody wanting leavened bread at once, certain persons set up as\r\nbread-makers, or bakers. In a short time bread-baking became quite an\r\nart, and \"Athenian bread\" was quoted all over Greece as the best bread,\r\njust as the honey of Hyamettus was celebrated as the best honey.\r\n\r\n1671. In our own times, and among civilized peoples, bread has become an\r\narticle of food of the first necessity; and properly so, for it\r\nconstitutes of itself a complete life-sustainer, the gluten, starch, and\r\nsugar, which it contains, representing azotized and hydro-carbonated\r\nnutrients, and combining the sustaining powers of the animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms in one product.\r\n\r\n1672. WHEATEN BREAD.--The finest, wholesomest, and most savoury bread is\r\nmade from wheaten flour. There are, of wheat, three leading qualities,--\r\nthe soft, the medium, and the hard wheat; the last of which yields a\r\nkind of bread that is not so white as that made from soft wheat, but is\r\nricher in gluten, and, consequently, more nutritive.\r\n\r\n1673. RYE BREAD.--This comes next to wheaten bread: it is not so rich in\r\ngluten, but is said to keep fresh longer, and to have some laxative\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n1674. BARLEY BREAD, INDIAN-CORN BREAD, &c.--Bread made from barley,\r\nmaize, oats, rice, potatoes, &c. \"rises\" badly, because the grains in\r\nquestion contain but little gluten, which makes the bread heavy, close\r\nin texture, and difficult of digestion; in fact, corn-flour has to be\r\nadded before panification can take place. In countries where wheat is\r\nscarce and maize abundant, the people make the latter a chief article of\r\nsustenance, when prepared in different forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAD-MAKING.\r\n\r\n1675. PANIFICATION, or bread-making, consists of the following\r\nprocesses, in the case of Wheaten Flour. Fifty or sixty per cent. of\r\nwater is added to the flour, with the addition of some leavening matter,\r\nand, preferably, of yeast from malt and hops. All kinds of leavening\r\nmatter have, however, been, and are still used in different parts of the\r\nworld: in the East Indies, \"toddy,\" which is a liquor that flows from\r\nthe wounded cocoa-nut tree; and, in the West Indies, \"dunder,\" or the\r\nrefuse of the distillation of rum. The dough then undergoes the\r\nwell-known process called _kneading_. The yeast produces fermentation, a\r\nprocess which may be thus described:--The dough reacting upon the\r\nleavening matter introduced, the starch of the flour is transformed into\r\nsaccharine matter, the saccharine matter being afterwards changed into\r\nalcohol and carbonic acid. The dough must be well \"bound,\" and yet allow\r\nthe escape of the little bubbles of carbonic acid which accompany the\r\nfermentation, and which, in their passage, cause the numerous little\r\nholes which are seen in light bread.\r\n\r\n1676. The yeast must be good and fresh, if the bread is to be digestible\r\nand nice. Stale yeast produces, instead of vinous fermentation, an\r\nacetous fermentation, which flavours the bread and makes it\r\ndisagreeable. A poor thin yeast produces an imperfect fermentation, the\r\nresult being a heavy unwholesome loaf.\r\n\r\n1677. When the dough is well kneaded, it is left to stand for some time,\r\nand then, as soon as it begins to swell, it is divided into loaves;\r\nafter which it is again left to stand, when it once more swells up, and\r\nmanifests, for the last time, the symptoms of fermentation. It is then\r\nput into the oven, where the water contained in the dough is partly\r\nevaporated, and the loaves swell up again, while a yellow crust begins\r\nto form upon the surface. When the bread is sufficiently baked, the\r\nbottom crust is hard and resonant if struck with the finger, while the\r\ncrumb is elastic, and rises again after being pressed down with the\r\nfinger. The bread is, in all probability, baked sufficiently if, on\r\nopening the door of the oven, you are met by a cloud of steam which\r\nquickly passes away.\r\n\r\n1678. One word as to the unwholesomeness of new bread and hot rolls.\r\nWhen bread is taken out of the oven, it is full of moisture; the starch\r\nis held together in masses, and the bread, instead of being crusted so\r\nas to expose each grain of starch to the saliva, actually prevents their\r\ndigestion by being formed by the teeth into leathery poreless masses,\r\nwhich lie on the stomach like so many bullets. Bread should always be at\r\nleast a day old before it is eaten; and, if properly made, and kept in a\r\n_cool dry_ place, ought to be perfectly soft and palatable at the end of\r\nthree or four days. Hot rolls, swimming in melted butter, and new bread,\r\nought to be carefully shunned by everybody who has the slightest respect\r\nfor that much-injured individual--the Stomach.\r\n\r\n1679. AERATED BREAD.--It is not unknown to some of our readers that Dr.\r\nDauglish, of Malvern, has recently patented a process for making bread\r\n\"light\" without the use of leaven. The ordinary process of bread-making\r\nby fermentation is tedious, and much labour of human hands is requisite\r\nin the kneading, in order that the dough may be thoroughly\r\ninterpenetrated with the leaven. The new process impregnates the bread,\r\nby the application of machinery, with carbonic acid gas, or fixed air.\r\nDifferent opinions are expressed about the bread; but it is curious to\r\nnote, that, as corn is now reaped by machinery, and dough is baked by\r\nmachinery, the whole process of bread-making is probably in course of\r\nundergoing changes which will emancipate both the housewife and the\r\nprofessional baker from a large amount of labour.\r\n\r\n1680. In the production of Aërated Bread, wheaten flour, water, salt,\r\nand carbonic acid gas (generated by proper machinery), are the only\r\nmaterials employed. We need not inform our readers that carbonic acid\r\ngas is the source of the effervescence, whether in common water coming\r\nfrom a depth, or in lemonade, or any aërated drink. Its action, in the\r\nnew bread, takes the place of fermentation in the old.\r\n\r\n1681. In the patent process, the dough is mixed in a great iron ball,\r\ninside which is a system of paddles, perpetually turning, and doing the\r\nkneading part of the business. Into this globe the flour is dropped till\r\nit is full, and then the common atmospheric air is pumped out, and the\r\npure gas turned on. The gas is followed by the water, which has been\r\naërated for the purpose, and then begins the churning or kneading part\r\nof the business.\r\n\r\n1682. Of course, it is not long before we have the dough, and very\r\n\"light\" and nice it looks. This is caught in tins, and passed on to the\r\nfloor of the oven, which is an endless floor, moving slowly through the\r\nfire. Done to a turn, the loaves emerge at the other end of the\r\napartment,--and the Aërated Bread is made.\r\n\r\n1683. It may be added, that it is a good plan to change one's baker from\r\ntime to time, and so secure a change in the quality of the bread that is\r\neaten.\r\n\r\n1684. MIXED BREADS.--Rye bread is hard of digestion, and requires longer\r\nand slower baking than wheaten bread. It is better when made with leaven\r\nof wheaten flour rather than yeast, and turns out lighter. It should not\r\nbe eaten till two days old. It will keep a long time.\r\n\r\n1685. A good bread may be made by mixing rye-flour, wheat-flour, and\r\nrice-paste in equal proportions; also by mixing rye, wheat, and barley.\r\nIn Norway, it is said that they only bake their barley broad once a\r\nyear, such is its \"keeping\" quality.\r\n\r\n1686. Indian-corn flour mixed with wheat-flour (half with half) makes a\r\nnice bread; but it is not considered very digestible, though it keeps\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n1687. Rice cannot be made into bread, nor can potatoes; but one-third\r\npotato flour to three-fourths wheaten flour makes a tolerably good loaf.\r\n\r\n1688. A very good bread, better than the ordinary sort, and of a\r\ndelicious flavour, is said to be produced by adopting the following\r\nrecipe:--Take ten parts of wheat-flour, five parts of potato-flour, one\r\npart of rice-paste; knead together, add the yeast, and bake as usual.\r\nThis is, of course, cheaper than wheaten bread.\r\n\r\n1689. Flour, when freshly ground, is too glutinous to make good bread,\r\nand should therefore not be used immediately, but should be kept dry for\r\na few weeks, and stirred occasionally, until it becomes dry, and\r\ncrumbles easily between the fingers.\r\n\r\n1690. Flour should be perfectly dry before being used for bread or\r\ncakes; if at all damp, the preparation is sure to be heavy. Before\r\nmixing it with the other ingredients, it is a good plan to place it for\r\nan hour or two before the fire, until it feels warm and dry.\r\n\r\n1691. Yeast from home-brewed beer is generally preferred to any other:\r\nit is very bitter, and, on that account, should be well washed, and put\r\naway until the thick mass settles. If it still continues bitter, the\r\nprocess should be repeated; and, before being used, all the water\r\nfloating at the top must be poured off. German yeast is now very much\r\nused, and should be moistened, and thoroughly mixed with the milk or\r\nwater with which the bread is to be made.\r\n\r\n1692. The following observations are extracted from a valuable work on\r\nBread-making, [Footnote: \"The English Bread-Book.\" By Eliza Acton.\r\nLondon: Longman.] and will be found very useful to our readers:--\r\n\r\n1693. The first thing required for making wholesome bread is the utmost\r\ncleanliness; the next is the soundness and sweetness of all the\r\ningredients used for it; and, in addition to these, there must be\r\nattention and care through the whole process.\r\n\r\n1694. An almost certain way of spoiling dough is to leave it half-made,\r\nand to allow it to become cold before it is finished. The other most\r\ncommon causes of failure are using yeast which is no longer sweet, or\r\nwhich has been frozen, or has had hot liquid poured over it.\r\n\r\n1695. Too small a proportion of yeast, or insufficient time allowed for\r\nthe dough to rise, will cause the bread to be heavy.\r\n\r\n1696. Heavy bread will also most likely be the result of making the\r\ndough very hard, and letting it become quite, cold, particularly in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n1697. If either the sponge or the dough be permitted to overwork itself,\r\nthat is to say, if the mixing and kneading be neglected when it has\r\nreached the proper point for either, sour bread will probably be the\r\nconsequence in warm weather, and bad bread in any. The goodness will\r\nalso be endangered by placing it so near a fire as to make any part of\r\nit hot, instead of maintaining the gentle and equal degree of heat\r\nrequired for its due fermentation.\r\n\r\n1698. MILK OR BUTTER.--Milk which is not perfectly sweet will not only\r\ninjure the flavour of the bread, but, in sultry weather, will often\r\ncause it to be quite uneatable; yet either of them, if fresh and good,\r\nwill materially improve its quality.\r\n\r\n1699. To keep bread sweet and fresh, as soon as it is cold it should be\r\nput into a clean earthen pan, with a cover to it: this pan should be\r\nplaced at a little distance from the ground, to allow a current of air\r\nto pass underneath. Some persons prefer keeping bread on clean wooden\r\nshelves, without being covered, that the crust may not soften. Stale\r\nbread may be freshened by warming it through in a gentle oven. Stale\r\npastry, cakes, &c., may also be improved by this method.\r\n\r\n1700. The utensils required for making bread, on a moderate scale, are a\r\nkneading-trough or pan, sufficiently large that the dough may be kneaded\r\nfreely without throwing the flour over the edges, and also to allow for\r\nits rising; a hair sieve for straining yeast, and one or two strong\r\nspoons.\r\n\r\n1701. Yeast must always be good of its kind, and in a fitting state to\r\nproduce ready and proper fermentation. Yeast of strong beer or ale\r\nproduces more effect than that of milder kinds; and the fresher the\r\nyeast, the smaller the quantity will be required to raise the dough.\r\n\r\n1702. As a general rule, the oven for baking bread should be rather\r\nquick, and the heat so regulated as to penetrate the dough without\r\nhardening the outside. The oven door should not be opened after the\r\nbread is put in until the dough is set, or has become firm, as the cool\r\nair admitted will have an unfavourable effect on it.\r\n\r\n1703. Brick ovens are generally considered the best adapted for baking\r\nbread: these should be heated with wood faggots, and then swept and\r\nmopped out, to cleanse them for the reception of the bread. Iron ovens\r\nare more difficult to manage, being apt to burn the surface of the bread\r\nbefore the middle is baked. To remedy this, a few clean bricks should be\r\nset at the bottom of the oven, close together, to receive the tins of\r\nbread. In many modern stoves the ovens are so much improved that they\r\nbake admirably; and they can always be brought to the required\r\ntemperature, when it is higher than is needed, by leaving the door open\r\nfor a time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW HINTS respecting the Making and Baking of CAKES.\r\n\r\n1704. _Eggs_ should always be broken into a cup, the whites and yolks\r\nseparated, and they should always be strained. Breaking the eggs thus,\r\nthe bad ones may be easily rejected without spoiling the others, and so\r\ncause no waste. As eggs are used instead of yeast, they should be very\r\nthoroughly whisked; they are generally sufficiently beaten when thick\r\nenough to carry the drop that falls from the whisk.\r\n\r\n1705. _Loaf Sugar_ should be well pounded, and then sifted through a\r\nfine sieve.\r\n\r\n1706. _Currants_ should be nicely washed, picked, dried in a cloth, and\r\nthen carefully examined, that no pieces of grit or stone may be left\r\namongst them. They should then be laid on a dish before the fire, to\r\nbecome thoroughly dry; as, if added damp to the other ingredients, cakes\r\nwill be liable to be heavy.\r\n\r\n1707. _Good Butter_ should always be used in the manufacture of cakes;\r\nand if beaten to a cream, it saves much time and labour to warm, but not\r\nmelt, it before beating.\r\n\r\n1708. Less butter and eggs are required for cakes when yeast is mixed\r\nwith the other ingredients.\r\n\r\n1709. The heat of the oven is of great importance, especially for large\r\ncakes. If the heat be not tolerably fierce, the batter will not rise. If\r\nthe oven is too quick, and there is any danger of the cake burning or\r\ncatching, put a sheet of clean paper over the top. Newspaper, or paper\r\nthat has been printed on, should never be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n1710. To know when a cake is sufficiently baked, plunge a clean knife\r\ninto the middle of it; draw it quickly out, and if it looks in the least\r\nsticky, put the cake back, and close the oven door until the cake is\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n1711. Cakes should be kept in closed tin canisters or jars, and in a dry\r\nplace. Those made with yeast do not keep so long as those made without\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISCUITS.\r\n\r\n1712. Since the establishment of the large modern biscuit manufactories,\r\nbiscuits have been produced both cheap and wholesome, in, comparatively\r\nspeaking, endless variety. Their actual component parts are, perhaps,\r\nknown only to the various makers; but there are several kinds of\r\nbiscuits which have long been in use, that may here be advantageously\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n1713. Biscuits belong to the class of unfermented bread, and are,\r\nperhaps, the most wholesome of that class. In cases where fermented\r\nbread does not agree with the human stomach, they may be recommended: in\r\nmany instances they are considered lighter, and less liable to create\r\nacidity and flatulence. The name is derived from the French _bis cuit_,\r\n\"twice-baked,\" because, originally, that was the mode of entirely\r\ndepriving them of all moisture, to insure their keeping; but, although\r\nthat process is no longer employed, the name is retained. The use of\r\nthis kind of bread on land is pretty general, and some varieties are\r\nluxuries; but, at sea, biscuits are articles of the first necessity.\r\n\r\n1714. SEA, or SHIP BISCUITS, are made of wheat-flour from which only the\r\ncoarsest bran has been separated. The dough is made up as stiff as it\r\ncan be worked, and is then formed into shapes, and baked in an oven;\r\nafter which, the biscuits are exposed in lofts over the oven until\r\nperfectly dry, to prevent them from becoming mouldy when stored.\r\n\r\n1715. CAPTAINS' BISCUITS are made in a similar manner, only of fine\r\nflour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE YEAST FOR BREAD.\r\n\r\n1716. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 oz. of hops, 3 quarts of water, 1 lb. of\r\nbruised malt, 1/2 pint of yeast.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the hops in the water for 20 minutes; let it stand for\r\nabout 5 minutes, then add it to 1 lb. of bruised malt prepared as for\r\nbrewing. Let the mixture stand covered till about lukewarm; then put in\r\nnot quite 1/2 pint of yeast; keep it warm, and let it work 3 or 4 hours;\r\nthen put it into small 1/2-pint bottles (ginger-beer bottles are the\r\nbest for the purpose), cork them well, and tie them down. The yeast is\r\nnow ready for use; it will keep good for a few weeks, and 1 bottle will\r\nbe found sufficient for 18 lbs. of flour. When required for use, boil 3\r\nlbs. of potatoes without salt, mash them in the same water in which they\r\nwere boiled, and rub them through a colander. Stir in about 1/2 lb. of\r\nflour; then put in the yeast, pour it in the middle of the flour, and\r\nlet it stand warm on the hearth all night, and in the morning let it be\r\nquite warm when it is kneaded. The bottles of yeast require very careful\r\nopening, as it is generally exceedingly ripe.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to boil the hops and water, the yeast to work 3 or 4\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient._--1/2 pint sufficient for 18 lbs. of flour.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIRKLEATHAM YEAST.\r\n\r\n1717. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of hops, 4 quarts of water, 1/2 lb. of flour,\r\n1/2 pint of yeast.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the hops and water for 20 minutes; strain, and mix with\r\nthe liquid 1/2 lb. of flour and not quite 1/2 pint of yeast. Bottle it\r\nup, and tie the corks down. When wanted for use, boil potatoes according\r\nto the quantity of bread to be made (about 3 lbs. are sufficient for\r\nabout a peck of flour); mash them, add to them 1/2 lb. of flour, and mix\r\nabout 1/2 pint of the yeast with them; let this mixture stand all day,\r\nand lay the bread to rise the night before it is wanted.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to boil the hops and water.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--1/2 pint of this yeast sufficient for a peck of flour, or\r\nrather more.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE GOOD HOME-MADE BREAD.\r\n\r\n(_Miss Acton's Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n1718. INGREDIENTS.--1 quartern of flour, 1 large tablespoonful of solid\r\nbrewer's yeast, or nearly 1 oz. of fresh German yeast, 1-1/4 to 1-1/2\r\npint of warm milk-and-water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COTTAGE LOAF.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIN BREAD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the flour into a large earthenware bowl or deep pan; then,\r\nwith a strong metal or wooden spoon, hollow out the middle; but do not\r\nclear it entirely away from the bottom of the pan, as, in that case, the\r\nsponge (or leaven, as it was formerly termed) would stick to it, which\r\nit ought not to do. Next take either a large tablespoonful of brewer's\r\nyeast which has been rendered solid by mixing it with plenty of cold\r\nwater, and letting it afterwards stand to settle for a day and night; or\r\nnearly an ounce of German yeast; put it into a large basin, and proceed\r\nto mix it, so that it shall be as smooth as cream, with 3/4 pint of warm\r\nmilk-and-water, or with water only; though even a very little milk will\r\nmuch improve the bread. Pour the yeast into the hole made in the flour,\r\nand stir into it as much of that which lies round it as will make a\r\nthick batter, in which there must be no lumps. Strew plenty of flour on\r\nthe top; throw a thick clean cloth over, and set it where the air is\r\nwarm; but do not place it upon the kitchen fender, for it will become\r\ntoo much heated there. Look at it from time to time: when it has been\r\nlaid for nearly an hour, and when the yeast has risen and broken through\r\nthe flour, so that bubbles appear in it, you will know that it is ready\r\nto be made up into dough. Then place the pan on a strong chair, or\r\ndresser, or table, of convenient height; pour into the sponge the\r\nremainder of the warm milk-and-water; stir into it as much of the flour\r\nas you can with the spoon; then wipe it out clean with your fingers, and\r\nlay it aside. Next take plenty of the remaining flour, throw it on the\r\ntop of the leaven, and begin, with the knuckles of both hands, to knead\r\nit well. When the flour is nearly all kneaded in, begin to draw the\r\nedges of the dough towards the middle, in order to mix the whole\r\nthoroughly; and when it is free from flour and lumps and crumbs, and\r\ndoes not stick to the hands when touched, it will be done, and may again\r\nbe covered with the cloth, and left to rise a second time. In 3/4 hour\r\nlook at it, and should it have swollen very much, and begin to crack, it\r\nwill be light enough to bake. Turn it then on to a paste-board or very\r\nclean dresser, and with a large sharp knife divide it in two; make it up\r\nquickly into loaves, and dispatch it to the oven: make one or two\r\nincisions across the tops of the loaves, as they will rise more easily\r\nif this be done. If baked in tins or pans, rub them with a tiny piece of\r\nbutter laid on a piece of clean paper, to prevent the dough from\r\nsticking to them. All bread should be turned upside down, or on its\r\nside, as soon as it is drawn from the oven: if this be neglected, the\r\nunder part of the loaves will become wet and blistered from the steam,\r\nwhich cannot then escape from them. _To make the dough without setting a\r\nsponge_, merely mix the yeast with the greater part of the warm\r\nmilk-and-water, and wet up the whole of the flour at once after a little\r\nsalt has been stirred in, proceeding exactly, in every other respect, as\r\nin the directions just given. As the dough will _soften_ in the rising,\r\nit should be made quite firm at first, or it will be too lithe by the\r\ntime it is ready for the oven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ITALIAN MILLET.]\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To be left to rise an hour the first time, 3/4 hour the second\r\ntime; to be baked from 1 to 1-1/4 hour, or baked in one loaf from 1-1/2\r\nto 2 hours.\r\n\r\n    ITALIAN MILLET, or Great Indian Millet, is cultivated in Egypt\r\n    and Nubia, where it is called _dhourra_, and is used as human\r\n    food, as well as for the fermentation of beer. It will grow on\r\n    poor soils, and is extremely productive. It has been introduced\r\n    into Italy, where they make a coarse bread from it; and it is\r\n    also employed in pastry and puddings: they also use it for\r\n    feeding horses and domestic fowls. It is the largest variety,\r\n    growing to the height of six feet; but it requires a warm\r\n    climate, and will not ripen in this country. A yellow variety,\r\n    called Golden Millet, is sold in the grocers' shops, for making\r\n    puddings, and is very delicate and wholesome.\r\n\r\nTO MAKE A PECK OF GOOD BREAD.\r\n\r\n1719. INGREDIENTS.--3 lbs. of potatoes, 6 pints of cold water, 1/2 pint\r\nof good yeast, a peck of flour, 2 oz. of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel and boil the potatoes; beat them to a cream while warm;\r\nthen add 1 pint of cold water, strain through a colander, and add to it\r\n1/2 pint of good yeast, which should have been put in water over-night,\r\nto take off its bitterness. Stir all well together with a wooden spoon,\r\nand pour the mixture into the centre of the flour; mix it to the\r\nsubstance of cream, cover it over closely, and let it remain near the\r\nfire for an hour; then add the 5 pints of water, milk-warm, with 2 oz.\r\nof salt; pour this in, and mix the whole to a nice light dough. Let it\r\nremain for about 2 hours; then make it into 7 loaves, and bake for about\r\n1-1/2 hour in a good oven. When baked, the bread should weigh nearly 20\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n    THE RED VARIETIES OF WHEAT are generally hardier and more easily\r\n    grown than the white sorts, and, although of less value to the\r\n    miller, they are fully more profitable to the grower, in\r\n    consequence of the better crops which they produce. Another\r\n    advantage the red wheats possess is their comparative immunity\r\n    from the attacks of mildew and fly. The best English wheat comes\r\n    from the counties of Kent and Essex; the qualities under these\r\n    heads always bearing a higher price than others, as will be seen\r\n    by the periodical lists in the journals.\r\n\r\nRICE BREAD.\r\n\r\n1720. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of rice allow 4 lbs. of wheat flour,\r\nnearly 3 tablespoonfuls of yeast, 1/4 oz. of salt. _Mode_.--Boil the\r\nrice in water until it is quite tender; pour off the water, and put the\r\nrice, before it is cold, to the flour. Mix these well together with the\r\nyeast, salt, and sufficient warm water to make the whole into a smooth\r\ndough; let it rise by the side of the fire, then form it into loaves,\r\nand bake them from 1-1/2 to 2 hours, according to their size. If the\r\nrice is boiled in milk instead of water, it makes very delicious bread\r\nor cakes. When boiled in this manner, it may be mixed with the flour\r\nwithout straining the liquid from it. _Time_.--1-1/2 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN-CORN-FLOUR BREAD.\r\n\r\n1721. INGREDIENTS.--To 4 lbs. of flour allow 2 lbs. of Indian-corn\r\nflour, 2 tablespoonfuls of yeast, 3 pints of warm water, 1/4 oz. of\r\nsalt. _Mode_.--Mix the two flours well together, with the salt; make a\r\nhole in the centre, and stir the yeast up well with 1/2 pint of the warm\r\nwater; put this into the middle of the flour, and mix enough of it with\r\nthe yeast to make a thin batter; throw a little flour over the surface\r\nof this batter, cover the whole with a thick cloth, and set it to rise\r\nin a warm place. When the batter has nicely risen, work the whole to a\r\nnice smooth dough, adding the water as required; knead it well, and\r\nmould the dough into loaves; let them rise for nearly 1/2 hour, then put\r\nthem into a well-heated oven. If made into 2 loaves, they will require\r\nfrom 1-1/2 to 2 hours baking.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIZE PLANT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EAR OF MAIZE.]\r\n\r\n    MAIZE.--Next to wheat and rice, maize is the grain most used in\r\n    the nourishment of man. In Asia, Africa, and America, it is the\r\n    principal daily food of a large portion of the population,\r\n    especially of the colonists. In some of the provinces of France,\r\n    too, it is consumed in large quantities. There are eight\r\n    varieties of the maize; the most productive is the maize of\r\n    Cusco. The flour of maize is yellow, and it contains an oily\r\n    matter, which, when fresh, gives it an agreeable flavour and\r\n    odour; but the action of the air on it soon develops rancidity.\r\n    If carried any distance, it should be stored away in air-tight\r\n    vessels. An excellent soup is prepared with meat and\r\n    maize-flour. The inhabitants of some countries, where wheat is\r\n    scarce, make, with maize and water, or milk and salt, a kind of\r\n    biscuit, which is pleasant in taste, but indigestible. Some of\r\n    the preparations of maize-flour are very good, and, when\r\n    partaken in moderation, suitable food for almost everybody.\r\n\r\nSODA BREAD.\r\n\r\n1722. INGREDIENTS.--To every 2 lbs. of flour allow 1 teaspoonful of\r\ntartaric acid, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1 teaspoonful of carbonate of\r\nsoda, 2 breakfast-cupfuls of cold milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the tartaric acid and salt be reduced to the finest\r\npossible powder; then mix them well with the flour. Dissolve the soda in\r\nthe milk, and pour it several times from one basin to another, before\r\nadding it to the flour. Work the whole quickly into a light dough,\r\ndivide it into 2 loaves, and put them into a well-heated oven\r\nimmediately, and bake for an hour. Sour milk or buttermilk may be used,\r\nbut then a little less acid will be needed.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour.\r\n\r\n    POLISH AND POMERANIAN WHEAT are accounted by authorities most\r\n    excellent. Large raft-like barges convey this grain down the\r\n    rivers, from the interior of the country to the seaports. This\r\n    corn is described as being white, hard, and thin-skinned; and it\r\n    yields a large quantity of flour, having a small proportion of\r\n    bran.\r\n\r\nEXCELLENT ROLLS.\r\n\r\n1723. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 1 oz. of butter, 1/4\r\npint of milk, 1 large teaspoonful of yeast, a little salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROLLS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Warm the butter in the milk, add to it the yeast and salt, and\r\nmix these ingredients well together. Put the flour into a pan, stir in\r\nthe above ingredients, and let the dough rise, covered in a warm place.\r\nKnead it well, make it into rolls, let them rise again for a few\r\nminutes, and bake in a quick oven. Richer rolls may be made by adding 1\r\nor 2 eggs and a larger proportion of butter, and their appearance\r\nimproved by brushing the tops over with yolk of egg or a little milk.\r\n\r\n_Time_--1 lb. of flour, divided into 6 rolls, from 15 to 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOT ROLLS.\r\n\r\n1724. This dish, although very unwholesome and indigestible, is\r\nnevertheless a great favourite, and eaten by many persons. As soon as\r\nthe rolls come from the baker's, they should be put into the oven,\r\nwhich, in the early part of the morning, is sure not to be very hot; and\r\nthe rolls must not be buttered until wanted. When they are quite hot,\r\ndivide them lengthwise into three; put some thin flakes of good butter\r\nbetween the slices, press the rolls together, and put them in the oven\r\nfor a minute or two, but not longer, or the butter would oil; take them\r\nout of the oven, spread the butter equally over, divide the rolls in\r\nhalf, and put them on to a very hot clean dish, and send them instantly\r\nto table.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE DRY TOAST.\r\n\r\n1725. To make dry toast properly, a great deal of attention is required;\r\nmuch more, indeed, than people generally suppose. Never use new bread\r\nfor making any kind of toast, as it eats heavy, and, besides, is very\r\nextravagant. Procure a loaf of household bread about two days old; cut\r\noff as many slices as may be required, not quite 1/4 inch in thickness;\r\ntrim off the crusts and ragged edges, put the bread on a toasting-fork,\r\nand hold it before a very clear fire. Move it backwards and forwards\r\nuntil the bread is nicely coloured; then turn it and toast the other\r\nside, and do not place it so near the fire that it blackens. Dry toast\r\nshould be more gradually made than buttered toast, as its great beauty\r\nconsists in its crispness, and this cannot be attained unless the\r\nprocess is slow and the bread is allowed gradually to colour. It should\r\nnever be made long before it is wanted, as it soon becomes tough, unless\r\nplaced on the fender in front of the fire. As soon as each piece is\r\nready, it should be put into a rack, or stood upon its edges, and sent\r\nquickly to table.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE HOT BUTTERED TOAST.\r\n\r\n1726. A loaf of household bread about two days old answers for making\r\ntoast better than cottage bread, the latter not being a good shape, and\r\ntoo crusty for the purpose. Cut as many nice even slices as may be\r\nrequired, rather more than 1/4 inch in thickness, and toast them before\r\na very bright fire, without allowing the bread to blacken, which spoils\r\nthe appearance and flavour of all toast. When of a nice colour on both\r\nsides, put it on a hot plate; divide some good butter into small pieces,\r\nplace them on the toast, set this before the fire, and when the butter\r\nis just beginning to melt, spread it lightly over the toast. Trim off\r\nthe crust and ragged edges, divide each round into 4 pieces, and send\r\nthe toast quickly to table. Some persons cut the slices of toast across\r\nfrom corner to corner, so making the pieces of a three-cornered shape.\r\nSoyer recommends that each slice should be cut into pieces as soon as it\r\nis buttered, and when all are ready, that they should be piled lightly\r\non the dish they are intended to be served on. He says that by cutting\r\nthrough 4 or 5 slices at a time, all the butter is squeezed out of the\r\nupper ones, while the bottom one is swimming in fat liquid. It is highly\r\nessential to use good butter for making this dish.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUFFINS.\r\n\r\n1727. INGREDIENTS.--To every quart of milk allow 1-1/2 oz. of German\r\nyeast, a little salt; flour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUFFINS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Warm the milk, add to it the yeast, and mix these well\r\ntogether; put them into a pan, and stir in sufficient flour to make the\r\nwhole into a dough of rather a soft consistence; cover it over with a\r\ncloth, and place it in a warm place to rise, and, when light and nicely\r\nrisen, divide the dough into pieces, and round them to the proper shape\r\nwith the hands; place them, in a layer of flour about two inches thick,\r\non wooden trays, and let them rise again; when this is effected, they\r\neach will exhibit a semi-globular shape. Then place them carefully on a\r\nhot-plate or stove, and bake them until they are slightly browned,\r\nturning them when they are done on one side. Muffins are not easily\r\nmade, and are more generally purchased than manufactured at home. _To\r\ntoast them_, divide the edge of the muffin all round, by pulling it\r\nopen, to the depth of about an inch, with the fingers. Put it on a\r\ntoasting-fork, and hold it before a very clear fire until one side is\r\nnicely browned, but not burnt; turn, and toast it on the other. Do not\r\ntoast them too quickly, as, if this is done, the middle of the muffin\r\nwill not be warmed through. When done, divide them by pulling them open;\r\nbutter them slightly on both sides, put them together again, and cut\r\nthem into halves: when sufficient are toasted and buttered, pile them on\r\na very hot dish, and send them very quickly to table.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 20 minutes to 1/2 hour to bake them.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 muffin to each person.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUMPETS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRUMPETS.]\r\n\r\n1728. These are made in the same manner as muffins; only, in making the\r\nmixture, let it be more like batter than dough. Let it rise for about\r\n1/2 hour; pour it into iron rings, which should be ready on a hot-plate;\r\nbake them, and when one side appears done, turn them quickly on the\r\nother. _To toast them_, have ready a very _bright clear_ fire; put the\r\ncrumpet on a toasting-fork, and hold it before the fire, _not too\r\nclose_, until it is nicely brown on one side, but do not allow it to\r\nblacken. Turn it, and brown the other side; then spread it with good\r\nbutter, cut it in half, and, when all are done, pile them on a hot dish,\r\nand send them quickly to table. Muffins and crumpets should always be\r\nserved on separate dishes, and both toasted and served as expeditiously\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 10 to 15 minutes to bake them.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 2 crumpets to each person.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAIN BUNS.\r\n\r\n1729. INGREDIENTS.--To every 2 lbs. of flour allow 6 oz. of moist sugar,\r\n1/2 gill of yeast, 1/2 pint of milk, 1/2 lb. of butter, warm milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the flour into a basin, mix the sugar well with it, make a\r\nhole in the centre, and stir in the yeast and milk (which should be\r\nlukewarm), with enough of the flour to make it the thickness of cream.\r\nCover the basin over with a cloth, and let the sponge rise in a warm\r\nplace, which will be accomplished in about 1-1/2 hour. Melt the butter,\r\nbut do not allow it to oil; stir it into the other ingredients, with\r\nenough warm milk to make the whole into a soft dough; then mould it into\r\nbuns about the size of an egg; lay them in rows quite 3 inches apart;\r\nset them again in a warm place, until they have risen to double their\r\nsize; then put them into a good brisk oven, and just before they are\r\ndone, wash them over with a little milk. From 15 to 20 minutes will be\r\nrequired to bake them nicely. These buns may be varied by adding a few\r\ncurrants, candied peel, or caraway seeds to the other ingredients; and\r\nthe above mixture answers for hot cross buns, by putting in a little\r\nground allspice; and by pressing a tin mould in the form of a cross in\r\nthe centre of the bun.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 to 20 minutes. _Average cost_, 1d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 18 buns.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE GOOD PLAIN BUNS.\r\n\r\n1730. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 6 oz. of good butter, 1/4 lb. of\r\nsugar, 1 egg, nearly 1/4 pint of milk, 2 small teaspoonfuls of\r\nbaking-powder, a few drops of essence of lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Warm the butter, without oiling it; beat it with a wooden\r\nspoon; stir the flour in gradually with the sugar, and mix these\r\ningredients well together. Make the milk lukewarm, beat up with it the\r\nyolk of the egg and the essence of lemon, and stir these to the flour,\r\n&c. Add the baking-powder, beat the dough well for about 10 minutes,\r\ndivide it into 24 pieces, put them into buttered tins or cups, and bake\r\nin a brisk oven from 20 to 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 to 30 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 12 buns. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT BUNS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUNS.]\r\n\r\n1731. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 teaspoonful of tartaric acid, 1/2 teaspoonful of\r\nbicarbonate of soda, 1 lb. of flour, 2 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of loaf\r\nsugar, 1/4 lb. of currants or raisins,--when liked, a few caraway seeds,\r\n1/2 pint of cold new milk, 1 egg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the tartaric acid, soda, and flour all together through a\r\nhair sieve; work the butter into the flour; add the sugar, currants, and\r\ncaraway seeds, when the flavour of them latter is liked. Mix all these\r\ningredients well together; make a hole in the middle of the flour, and\r\npour in the milk, mixed with the egg, which should be well beaten; mix\r\nquickly, and set the dough, with a fork, on baking-tins, and bake the\r\nbuns for about 20 minutes. This mixture makes a very good cake, and if\r\nput into a tin, should be baked 1-1/2 hour. The same quantity of flour,\r\nsoda, and tartaric acid, with 1/2 pint of milk and a little salt, will\r\nmake either bread or teacakes, if wanted quickly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes for the buns; if made into a cake, 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make about 12 buns.\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTORIA BUNS.\r\n\r\n1732. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of pounded loaf sugar, 1 egg, 1-1/2 oz. of\r\nground rice, 2 oz. of butter, 1-1/2 oz. of currants, a few thin slices\r\nof candied peel; flour.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Whisk the egg, stir in the sugar, and beat these ingredients\r\nwell together; beat the butter to a cream, stir in the ground rice,\r\ncurrants, and candied peel, and as much flour as will make it of such a\r\nconsistency that it may be rolled into 7 or 8 balls. Put these on to a\r\nbuttered tin, and bake them from 1/2 to 3/4 hour. They should be put\r\ninto the oven immediately, or they will become heavy; and the oven\r\nshould be tolerably brisk.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 7 or 8 buns. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN RUSKS.\r\n\r\n1733. A stale Savoy or lemon cake may be converted into very good rusks\r\nin the following manner. Cut the cake into slices, divide each slice in\r\ntwo; put them on a baking-sheet, in a slow oven, and when they are of a\r\nnice brown and quite hard, they are done. They should be kept in a\r\nclosed tin canister in a dry place, to preserve their crispness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PANNICLED MILLET.]\r\n\r\n    PANNICLED MILLET.--This is the smallest-seeded of the\r\n    corn-plants, being a true grass; but the number of the seeds in\r\n    each ear makes up for their size. It grows in sandy soils that\r\n    will not do for the cultivation of many other kinds of grain,\r\n    and forms the chief sustenance in the arid districts of Arabia,\r\n    Syria, Nubia, and parts of India. It is not cultivated in\r\n    England, being principally confined to the East. The nations who\r\n    make use of it grind it, in the primitive manner, between two\r\n    stones, and make it into a diet which, cannot be properly called\r\n    bread, but rather a kind of soft thin cake half-baked. When we\r\n    take into account that the Arabians are fond of lizards and\r\n    locusts as articles of food, their _cuisine_, altogether, is\r\n    scarcely a tempting one.\r\n\r\nTO MAKE RUSKS.\r\n\r\n(_Suffolk Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n1734. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of flour allow 2 oz. of butter, 1/4\r\npint of milk, 2 oz. of loaf sugar, 3 eggs, 1 tablespoonful of yeast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSKS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk and butter into a saucepan, and keep shaking it\r\nround until the latter is melted. Put the flour into a basin with the\r\nsugar, mix these well together, and beat the eggs. Stir them with the\r\nyeast to the milk and butter, and with this liquid work the flour into a\r\nsmooth dough. Cover a cloth over the basin, and leave the dough to rise\r\nby the side of the fire; then knead it, and divide it into 12 pieces;\r\nplace them in a brisk oven, and bake for about 20 minutes. Take the\r\nrusks out, break them in half, and then set them in the oven to get\r\ncrisp on the other side. When cold, they should be put into tin\r\ncanisters to keep them dry; and, if intended for the cheese course, the\r\nsifted sugar should be omitted.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to bake the rusks; 5 minutes to render them crisp\r\nafter being divided.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 2 dozen rusks. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nALMOND ICING FOR CAKES.\r\n\r\n1735. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of finely-pounded loaf sugar allow 1\r\nlb. of sweet almonds, the whites of 4 eggs, a little rose-water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Blanch the almonds, and pound them (a few at a time) in a\r\nmortar to a paste, adding a little rose-water to facilitate the\r\noperation. Whisk the whites of the eggs to a strong froth; mix them with\r\nthe pounded almonds, stir in the sugar, and beat altogether. When the\r\ncake is sufficiently baked, lay on the almond icing, and put it into the\r\noven to dry. Before laying this preparation on the cake, great care must\r\nbe taken that it is nice and smooth, which is easily accomplished by\r\nwell beating the mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR ICING FOR CAKES.\r\n\r\n1736. INGREDIENTS.--To every lb. of loaf sugar allow the whites of 4\r\neggs, 1 oz. of fine starch.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat the eggs to a strong froth, and gradually sift in the\r\nsugar, which should be reduced to the finest possible powder, and\r\ngradually add the starch, also finely powdered. Beat the mixture well\r\nuntil the sugar is smooth; then with a spoon or broad knife lay the\r\nicing equally over the cakes. These should then be placed in a very cool\r\noven, and the icing allowed to dry and harden, but not to colour. The\r\nicing may be coloured with strawberry or currant-juice, or with prepared\r\ncochineal. If it be put on the cakes as soon as they are withdrawn from\r\nthe oven, it will become firm and hard by the time the cakes are cold.\r\nOn very rich cakes, such as wedding, christening cakes, &c., a layer of\r\nalmond icing, No. 1735, is usually spread over the top, and over that\r\nthe white icing as described. All iced cakes should be kept in a very\r\ndry place.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISCUIT POWDER, generally used for Infants' Food.\r\n\r\n1737. This powder may be purchased in tin canisters, and may also be\r\nprepared at home. Dry the biscuits well in a slow oven; roll them and\r\ngrind them with a rolling-pin on a clean board, until they are reduced\r\nto powder; sift it through a close hair sieve, and it is fit for use. It\r\nshould be kept in well-covered tins, and in a dry place.\r\n\r\n\r\nARROWROOT BISCUITS OR DROPS.\r\n\r\n1738. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of butter, 6 eggs, 1/2 lb. of flour, 6 oz.\r\nof arrowroot, 1/2 lb. of pounded loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat the butter to a cream; whisk the eggs to a strong froth,\r\nadd them to the butter, stir in the flour a little at a time, and beat\r\nthe mixture well. Break down all the lumps from the arrowroot, and add\r\nthat with the sugar to the other ingredients. Mix all well together,\r\ndrop the dough on a buttered tin, in pieces the size of a shilling, and\r\nbake the biscuits about 1/4 hour in a slow oven.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make from 3 to 4 dozen biscuits.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nNICE BREAKFAST CAKES.\r\n\r\n1739. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 1/2 teaspoonful of tartaric acid,\r\n1/2 teaspoonful of salt, 1/2 teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, 1-1/2\r\nbreakfast-cupful of milk, 1 oz. of sifted loaf sugar, 2 eggs.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--These cakes are made in the same manner as the soda bread No.\r\n1722, with the addition of eggs and sugar. Mix the flour, tartaric acid,\r\nand salt well together, taking care that the two latter ingredients are\r\nreduced to the finest powder, and stir in the sifted sugar, which should\r\nalso be very fine. Dissolve the soda in the milk, add the eggs, which\r\nshould be well whisked, and with this liquid work the flour, &c. into a\r\nlight dough.

INGREDIENTS.--10 oz. of sifted sugar, 3 eggs, 6 oz. of grated\r\ncocoa-nut.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Whisk the eggs until they are very light; add the sugar\r\ngradually; then stir in the cocoa-nut. Roll a tablespoonful of the paste\r\nat a time in your hands in the form of a pyramid; place the pyramids on\r\npaper, put the paper on tins, and bake the biscuits in rather a cool\r\noven until they are just coloured a light brown.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1/4 hour. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRISP BISCUITS.\r\n\r\n1741. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, the yolk of 1 egg, milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the flour and the yolk of the egg with sufficient milk to\r\nmake the whole into a very stiff paste; beat it well, and knead it until\r\nit is perfectly smooth. Roll the paste out very thin; with a round\r\ncutter shape it into small biscuits, and bake them a nice brown in a\r\nslow oven from 12 to 18 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--12 to 18 minutes. _Average cost_, 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESSERT BISCUITS, which may be flavoured with Ground Ginger, Cinnamon,\r\n&c. &c.\r\n\r\n1742.

Add the flour by degrees,\r\nthen the sugar and flavouring, and moisten the whole with the yolks of\r\nthe eggs, which should previously be well beaten. When all the\r\ningredients are thoroughly incorporated, drop the mixture from a spoon\r\non to a buttered paper, leaving a distance between each cake, as they\r\nspread as soon as they begin to get warm. Bake in rather a slow oven\r\nfrom 12 to 18 minutes, and do not let the biscuits acquire too much\r\ncolour. In making the above quantity, half may be flavoured with ground\r\nginger and the other half with essence of lemon or currants, to make a\r\nvariety. With whatever the preparation is flavoured, so are the biscuits\r\ncalled; and an endless variety may be made in this manner.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--12 to 18 minutes, or rather longer, in a very slow oven.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make from 3 to 4 dozen cakes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON BISCUITS.\r\n\r\n1743--INGREDIENTS.--1-1/4 lb. of flour, 3/4 lb. of loaf sugar, 6 oz. of\r\nfresh butter, 4 eggs, 1 oz. of lemon-peel, 2 dessertspoonfuls of\r\nlemon-juice.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the flour into the butter; stir in the pounded sugar and\r\nvery finely-minced lemon-peel, and when these ingredients are thoroughly\r\nmixed, add the eggs, which should be previously well whisked, and the\r\nlemon-juice. Beat the mixture well for a minute or two, then drop it\r\nfrom a spoon on to a buttered tin, about 2 inches apart, as the cakes\r\nwill spread when they get warm; place the tin in the oven, and bake the\r\ncakes of a pale brown from 15 to 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 to 20 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACAROONS.\r\n\r\n1744. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of sweet almonds, 1/2 lb. of sifted loaf\r\nsugar, the whites of 3 eggs, wafer-paper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACAROONS.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Blanch, skin, and dry the almonds, and pound them well with a\r\nlittle orange-flower water or plain water; then add to them the sifted\r\nsugar and the whites of the eggs, which should be beaten to a stiff\r\nfroth, and mix all the ingredients well together. When the paste looks\r\nsoft, drop it at equal distances from a biscuit-syringe on to sheets of\r\nwafer-paper; put a strip of almond on the top of each; strew some sugar\r\nover, and bake the macaroons in rather a slow oven, of a light brown\r\ncolour when hard and set, they are done, and must not be allowed to get\r\nvery brown, as that would spoil their appearance. If the cakes, when\r\nbaked, appear heavy, add a little more white of egg, but let this always\r\nbe well whisked before it is added to the other ingredients. We have\r\ngiven a recipe for making these cakes, but we think it almost or quite\r\nas economical to purchase such articles as these at a good\r\nconfectioner's.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 15 to 20 minutes, in a slow oven.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 8d. per lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nRATAFIAS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RATAFIAS.]\r\n\r\n1745.

Drop the mixture through a small biscuit-syringe on to\r\ncartridge paper, and bake the cakes from 10 to 12 minutes in rather a\r\nquicker oven than for macaroons. A very small quantity should be dropped\r\non the paper to form one cake, as, when baked, the ratafias should be\r\nabout the size of a large button.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 to 12 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s. 8d. per lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE BISCUITS OR CAKES.\r\n\r\n1746.

Roll out the paste, shape it with a round paste-cutter into\r\nsmall cakes, and bake them from 12 to 18 minutes in a very slow oven.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--12 to 18 minutes. _Average cost_, 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make about 18 cakes. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    GROUND RICE, or rice-flour, is used for making several kinds of\r\n    cakes, also for thickening soups, and for mixing with wheaten\r\n    flour in producing Manna Kroup. The Americans make rice-bread,\r\n    and prepare the flour for it in the following manner:--When the\r\n    rice is thoroughly cleansed, the water is drawn off, and the\r\n    rice, while damp, bruised in a mortar: it is then dried, and\r\n    passed through a hair sieve.\r\n\r\nROCK BISCUITS.\r\n\r\n1747.

Mix all well together, and\r\nput the dough, with a fork, on the tins, making it look as rough as\r\npossible. Bake the cakes in a moderate oven from 20 minutes to 1/2 hour;\r\nwhen they are done, allow them to get cool, and store them away in a tin\r\ncanister, in a dry place.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes to 1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVOY BISCUITS OR CAKES.\r\n\r\n1748.

Roll it out thin;\r\ncut it with the top of a glass into round biscuits; prick them well, and\r\nbake them from 6 to 10 minutes. The above is the proportion of milk\r\nwhich we think would convert the flour into a stiff paste; but should it\r\nbe found too much, an extra spoonful or two of flour must be put in.\r\nThese biscuits are very nice for the cheese course.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--6 to 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSODA BISCUITS.\r\n\r\n1751.

Quickly stir in the soda, roll the\r\npaste out until it is about 1/2 inch thick, cut it into small round\r\ncakes with a tin cutter, and bake them from 12 to 18 minutes in rather a\r\nbrisk oven. After the soda is added, great expedition is necessary in\r\nrolling and cutting out the paste, and in putting the biscuits\r\n_immediately_ into the oven, or they will be heavy.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--12 to 18 minutes. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make about 3 dozen cakes. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nALMOND CAKE.\r\n\r\n1752.

Then mix in\r\nlightly the currants, almonds, and candied peel with the wine and\r\nbrandy; and having lined a hoop with buttered paper, fill it with the\r\nmixture, and bake the cake in a tolerably quick oven, taking care,\r\nhowever, not to burn it: to prevent this, the top of it may be covered\r\nwith a sheet of paper. To ascertain whether the cake is done, plunge a\r\nclean knife into the middle of it, withdraw it directly, and if the\r\nblade is not sticky, and looks bright, the cake is sufficiently baked.\r\nThese cakes are usually spread with a thick layer of almond icing, and\r\nover that another layer of sugar icing, and afterwards ornamented.

Then beat the yolks\r\nof the eggs, and add them, with the lemon-juice, to the whites, &c.;\r\ndredge in the flour gradually; keep beating the mixture well; put it\r\ninto a buttered mould, and bake the cake about an hour, or rather\r\nlonger. The addition of a little butter, beaten to a cream, we think,\r\nwould improve this cake.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--About 1 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 4d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNCHEON CAKE.\r\n\r\n1765. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of butter, 1 lb. of flour, 1/2 oz. of\r\ncaraway seeds, 1/4 lb. of currants, 6 oz. of moist sugar, 1 oz. of\r\ncandied peel, 3 eggs, 1/2 pint of milk, 1 small teaspoonful of carbonate\r\nof soda.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the butter into the flour until it is quite fine; add the\r\ncaraway seeds, currants (which should be nicely washed, picked, and\r\ndried), sugar, and candied peel cut into thin slices; mix these well\r\ntogether, and moisten with the eggs, which should be well whisked. Boil\r\nthe milk, and add to it, whilst boiling, the carbonate of soda, which\r\nmust be well stirred into it, and, with the milk, mix the other\r\ningredients. Butter a tin, pour the cake into it, and bake it in a\r\nmoderate oven from 3/4 to 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 to 14 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 8d. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    CARBONATE OF SODA--Soda was called the mineral alkali, because\r\n    it was originally dug up out of the ground in Africa and other\r\n    countries: this state of carbonate of soda is called _natron._\r\n    But carbonate of soda is likewise procured from the combustion\r\n    of marine plants, or such as grow on the sea-shore. Pure\r\n    carbonate of soda is employed for making effervescing draughts,\r\n    with lemon-juice, citric acid, or tartaric acid. The chief\r\n    constituent of soda, the alkali, has been used in France from\r\n    time immemorial in the manufacture of soap and glass, two\r\n    chemical productions which employ and keep in circulation an\r\n    immense amount of capital. A small pinch of carbonate of soda\r\n    will give an extraordinary lightness to puff pastes; and,\r\n    introduced into the teapot, will extract the full strength of\r\n    the tea. But its qualities have a powerful effect upon delicate\r\n    constitutions, and it is not to be used incautiously in any\r\n    preparation.\r\n\r\nA NICE PLAIN CAKE.\r\n\r\n1766. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 1 teaspoonful of Borwick's\r\nbaking-powder, 1/4 lb. of good dripping, 1 teacupful of moist sugar, 3\r\neggs, 1 breakfast-cupful of milk, 1 oz. of caraway seeds, 1/2 lb. of\r\ncurrants.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the flour and baking-powder into a basin; stir those\r\ntogether; then rub in the dripping, add the sugar, caraway seeds, and\r\ncurrants; whisk the eggs with the milk, and beat all together very\r\nthoroughly until the ingredients are well mixed. Butter a tin, put in\r\nthe cake, and bake it from 11/2 to 2 hours. Let the dripping be quite\r\nclean before using: to insure this, it is a good plan to clarify it.\r\nBeef dripping is better than any other for cakes, &c., as mutton\r\ndripping frequently has a very unpleasant flavour, which would be\r\nimparted to the preparation.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 to 2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NICE PLAIN CAKE FOR CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n1767. INGREDIENTS.--1 quartern of dough, 1/4 lb. of moist sugar, 1/4 lb.\r\nof butter or good beef dripping, 1/4 pint of warm milk, 1/2 grated\r\nnutmeg or 1/2 oz. of caraway seeds.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--If you are not in the habit of making bread at home, procure\r\nthe dough from the baker's, and, as soon as it comes in, put it into a\r\nbasin near the fire; cover the basin with a thick cloth, and let the\r\ndough remain a little while to rise. In the mean time, beat the butter\r\nto a cream, and make the milk warm; and when the dough has risen, mix\r\nwith it thoroughly all the above ingredients, and knead the cake well\r\nfor a few minutes. Butter some cake-tins, half fill them, and stand them\r\nin a warm place, to allow the dough to rise again. When the tins are\r\nthree parts full, put the cakes into a good oven, and bake them from\r\n13/4 to 2 hours. A few currants might be substituted for the caraway\r\nseeds when the flavour of the latter is disliked.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-3/4 to 2 hours. _Average cost_, _1s. 2d._\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON PLUM CAKE.\r\n\r\n1768. INGREDIENTS.--3 lbs. of flour, 6 oz. of butter or good dripping, 6\r\noz. of moist sugar, 6 oz. of currants, 4 oz. of pounded allspice, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of fresh yeast, 1 pint of new milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the butter into the flour; add the sugar, currants, and\r\nallspice; warm the milk, stir to it the yeast, and mix the whole into a\r\ndough; knead it well, and put it into 6 buttered tins; place them near\r\nthe fire for nearly an hour for the dough to rise, then bake the cakes\r\nin a good oven from 1 to 11/4 hour. To ascertain when they are done,\r\nplunge a clean knife into the middle, and if on withdrawal it comes out\r\nclean, the cakes are done.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 to 1-1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 6 small cakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NICE PLUM CAKE.\r\n\r\n1769. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 1/4 lb. of butter, 1/2 lb. of sugar,\r\n1/2 lb. of currants, 2 oz. of candied lemon-peel, 1/2 pint of milk, 1\r\nteaspoonful of ammonia or carbonate of soda.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the flour into a basin with the sugar, currants, and sliced\r\ncandied peel; beat the butter to a cream, and mix all these ingredients\r\ntogether with the milk. Stir the ammonia into 2 tablespoonfuls of milk\r\nand add it to the dough, and beat the whole well, until everything is\r\nthoroughly mixed. Put the dough into a buttered tin, and bake the cake\r\nfrom 1-1/2 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOUND CAKE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POUND CAKE.]\r\n\r\n1770. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of butter, 1-1/4 lb. of flour, 1 lb. of\r\npounded loaf sugar, 1 lb. of currants, 9 eggs, 2 oz. of candied peel,\r\n1/2 oz. of citron, 1/2 oz. of sweet almonds; when liked, a little\r\npounded mace.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Work the butter to a cream; dredge in the flour; add the sugar,\r\ncurrants, candied peel, which should be cut into neat slices, and the\r\nalmonds, which should be blanched and chopped, and mix all these well\r\ntogether; whisk the eggs, and let them be thoroughly blended with the\r\ndry ingredients. Beat the cake well for 20 minutes, and put it into a\r\nround tin, lined at the bottom and sides with a strip of white buttered\r\npaper. Bake it from 1-1/2 to 2 hours, and let the oven be well heated\r\nwhen the cake is first put in, as, if this is not the case, the currants\r\nwill all sink to the bottom of it. To make this preparation light, the\r\nyolks and whites of the eggs should be beaten separately, and added\r\nseparately to the other ingredients. A glass of wine is sometimes added\r\nto the mixture; but this is scarcely necessary, as the cake will be\r\nfound quite rich enough without it.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 to 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient._--The above quantity divided in two will make two\r\nnice-sized cakes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PAVINI CAKE.\r\n\r\n1771. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of ground rice, 1/2 lb. of\r\nraisins stoned and cut into small pieces, 1/4 lb. of currants, 1/4 lb.\r\nof butter, 2 oz. of sweet almonds, 1/4 lb. of sifted loaf sugar, 1/2\r\nnutmeg grated, 1 pint of milk, 1 teaspoonful of carbonate of soda.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Stone and cut the raisins into small pieces; wash, pick, and\r\ndry the currants; melt the butter to a cream, but without oiling it;\r\nblanch and chop the almonds, and grate the nutmeg. When all these\r\ningredients are thus prepared, mix them well together; make the milk\r\nwarm, stir in the soda, and with this liquid make the whole into a\r\npaste. Butter a mould, rather more than half fill it with the dough, and\r\nbake the cake in a moderate oven from 1-1/2 to 2 hours, or less time\r\nshould it be made into 2 cakes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 to 2 hours. _Average cost_, 1s. 8d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAKE-MOULD.]\r\n\r\nRICE CAKE.\r\n\r\n1772. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of ground rice, 1/2 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of\r\nloaf sugar, 9 eggs, 20 drops of essence of lemon, or the rind of 1\r\nlemon, 1/4 lb. of butter.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Separate the whites from the yolks of the eggs; whisk them both\r\nwell, and add to the latter the butter beaten to a cream. Stir in the\r\nflour, rice, and lemon (if the rind is used, it must be very finely\r\nminced), and beat the mixture well; then add the whites of the eggs,\r\nbeat the cake again for some time, put it into a buttered mould or tin,\r\nand bake it for nearly 1-1/2 hour. It may be flavoured with essence of\r\nalmonds, when this is preferred.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Nearly 1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEEN-CAKES.\r\n\r\n1773. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of butter, 1/2 lb. of\r\npounded loaf sugar, 3 eggs, 1 teacupful of cream, 1/2 lb. of currants, 1\r\nteaspoonful of carbonate of soda, essence of lemon, or almonds to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Work the butter to a cream; dredge in the flour, add the sugar\r\nand currants, and mix the ingredients well together. Whisk the eggs, mix\r\nthem with the cream and flavouring, and stir these to the flour; add the\r\ncarbonate of soda, beat the paste well for 10 minutes, put it into small\r\nbuttered pans, and bake the cake from 1/4 to 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\nGrated lemon-rind may be substituted for the lemon and almond\r\nflavouring, which will make the cakes equally nice.\r\n\r\n_Time_. 1/4 to 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUCER-CAKE FOR TEA.\r\n\r\n1774. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of flour, 1/4 lb. of _tous-les-mois_, 1/4\r\nlb. of pounded white sugar, 1/4 lb. of butter, 2 eggs, 1 oz. of candied\r\norange or lemon-peel.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the flour and _tous-les-mois_ together; add the sugar, the\r\ncandied peel cut into thin slices, the butter beaten to a cream, and the\r\neggs well whisked. Beat the mixture for 10 minutes, put it into a\r\nbuttered cake-tin or mould, or, if this is not obtainable, a soup-plate\r\nanswers the purpose, lined with a piece of buttered paper. Bake the cake\r\nin a moderate oven from 1 to 1-1/4 hour, and when cold, put it away in a\r\ncovered canister. It will remain good some weeks, even if it be cut into\r\nslices.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 to 1-1/4 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON SEED-CAKE.\r\n\r\n1775. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 quartern of dough, 1/4 lb. of good dripping, 6\r\noz. of moist sugar, 1/2 oz. of caraway seeds, 1 egg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--If the dough is sent in from the baker's, put it in a basin\r\ncovered with a cloth, and set it in a warm place to rise. Then with a\r\nwooden spoon beat the dripping to a liquid; add it, with the other\r\ningredients, to the dough, and beat it until everything is very\r\nthoroughly mixed. Put it into a buttered tin, and bake the cake for\r\nrather more than 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 2 hours.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 8d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VERY GOOD SEED-CAKE.\r\n\r\n1776.

Whisk the eggs, stir to them the brandy, and beat the cake\r\nagain for 10 minutes. Put it into a tin lined with buttered paper, and\r\nbake it from 1-1/2 to 2 hours. This cake would be equally nice made with\r\ncurrants, and omitting the caraway seeds.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 to 2 hours. _Average cost_, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n    BREAD-MAKING IN SPAIN.--The bread in the south of Spain is\r\n    delicious: it is white as snow, close as cake, and yet very\r\n    light; the flavour is most admirable, for the wheat is good and\r\n    pure, and the bread well kneaded. The way they make this bread\r\n    is as follows:--From large round panniers filled with wheat they\r\n    take out a handful at a time, sorting it most carefully and\r\n    expeditiously, and throwing every defective grain into another\r\n    basket. This done, the wheat is ground between two circular\r\n    stones, as it was ground in Egypt 2,000 years ago (see No. 117),\r\n    the requisite rotary motion being given by a blindfolded mule,\r\n    which paces round and round with untiring patience, a bell being\r\n    attached to his neck, which, as long as he is in movement,\r\n    tinkles on; and when it stops, he is urged to his duty by the\r\n    shout of \"_Arre, mula_,\" from some one within hearing. When\r\n    ground, the wheat is sifted through three sieves, the last of\r\n    these being so fine that only the pure flour can pass through\r\n    it: this is of a pale apricot-colour. The bread is made in the\r\n    evening. It is mixed with only sufficient water, with a little\r\n    salt in it, to make it into dough: a very small quantity of\r\n    leaven, or fermenting mixture is added. The Scripture says, \"A\r\n    little leaven leaveneth the whole lump;\" but in England, to\r\n    avoid the trouble of kneading, many put as much leaven or yeast\r\n    in one batch of household bread as in Spain would last them a\r\n    week for the six or eight donkey-loads of bread they send every\r\n    night from their oven. The dough made, it is put into sacks, and\r\n    carried on the donkeys' backs to the oven in the centre of the\r\n    village, so as to bake it immediately it is kneaded. On arriving\r\n    there, the dough is divided into portions weighing 3 lbs. each.\r\n    Two long narrow wooden tables on trestles are then placed down\r\n    the room; and now a curious sight may be seen. About twenty men\r\n    (bakers) come in and range themselves on one side of the tables.\r\n    A lump of dough is handed to the nearest, which he commences\r\n    kneading and knocking about with all his might for about 3 or 4\r\n    minutes, and then passes it on to his neighbour, who does the\r\n    same; and so on successively until all have kneaded it, when it\r\n    becomes as soft as new putty, and ready for the oven. Of course,\r\n    as soon as the first baker has handed the first lump to his\r\n    neighbour, another is given to him, and so on till the whole\r\n    quantity of dough is successively kneaded by them all. The\r\n    bakers' wives and daughters shape the loaves for the oven, and\r\n    some of them are very small, and they are baked immediately. The\r\n    ovens are very large, and not heated by fires _under_ them; but\r\n    a quantity of twigs of the herbs of sweet marjoram and thyme,\r\n    which cover the hills in great profusion, are put in the oven\r\n    and ignited. They heat the oven to any extent required; and, as\r\n    the bread gets baked, the oven gets gradually colder; so the\r\n    bread is never burned. They knead the bread in Spain with such\r\n    force, that the palm of the hand and the second joints of the\r\n    fingers of the bakers are covered with corns; and it so affects\r\n    the chest, that they cannot work more than two hours at a time.\r\n\r\nSNOW-CAKE.\r\n\r\n1777. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of _tous-les-mois_, 1/4 lb. of white pounded\r\nsugar, 1/4 lb. of fresh or washed salt butter, 1 egg, the juice of 1\r\nlemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat the butter to a cream; then add the egg, previously well\r\nbeaten, and then the other ingredients; if the mixture is not light, add\r\nanother egg, and beat for 1/4 hour, until it turns white and light. Line\r\na flat tin, with raised edges, with a sheet of buttered paper; pour in\r\nthe cake, and put it into the oven. It must be rather slow, and the cake\r\nnot allowed to brown at all. If the oven is properly heated, 1 to 1-1/4\r\nhour will be found long enough to bake it. Let it cool a few minutes,\r\nthen with a clean sharp knife cut it into small square pieces, which\r\nshould be gently removed to a large flat dish to cool before putting\r\naway. This will keep for several weeks.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 to 1-1/4 hour. _Average cost_, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOW-CAKE.\r\n\r\n(_A genuine Scotch Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n1778. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of arrowroot, 1/2 lb. of pounded white sugar,\r\n1/2 lb. of butter, the whites of 6 eggs; flavouring to taste, of essence\r\nof almonds, or vanilla, or lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat the butter to a cream; stir in the sugar and arrowroot\r\ngradually, at the same time beating the mixture. Whisk the whites of the\r\neggs to a stiff froth, add them to the other ingredients, and beat well\r\nfor 20 minutes. Put in whichever of the above flavourings may be\r\npreferred; pour the cake into a buttered mould or tin and bake it in a\r\nmoderate oven from 1 to 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 to 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with the best Bermuda arrowroot, 4s. 6d.; with St.\r\nVincent ditto, 2s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make a moderate-sized cake. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRAP-CAKES.\r\n\r\n1779. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of leaf, or the inside fat of a pig; 1-1/2\r\nlb. of flour, 1/4 lb. of moist sugar, 1/2 lb. of currants, 1 oz. of\r\ncandied lemon-peel, ground allspice to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the leaf, or flead, as it is sometimes called, into small\r\npieces; put it into a large dish, which place in a quick oven; be\r\ncareful that it does not burn, and in a short time it will be reduced to\r\noil, with the small pieces of leaf floating on the surface; and it is of\r\nthese that the cakes should be made. Gather all the scraps together, put\r\nthem into a basin with the flour, and rub them well together. Add the\r\ncurrants, sugar, candied peel, cut into thin slices, and the ground\r\nallspice. When all these ingredients are well mixed, moisten with\r\nsufficient cold water to make the whole into a nice paste; roll it out\r\nthin, cut it into shapes, and bake the cakes in a quick oven from 15 to\r\n20 minutes. These are very economical and wholesome cakes for children,\r\nand the lard, melted at home, produced from the flead, is generally\r\nbetter than that you purchase. To prevent the lard from burning, and to\r\ninsure its being a good colour, it is better to melt it in a jar placed\r\nin a saucepan of boiling water; by doing it in this manner, there will\r\nbe no chance of its discolouring.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--15 to 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 3 or 4 dozen cakes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from September to March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEAT.]\r\n\r\n    Wheat is liable to several diseases, which affect the flour made\r\n    from it, and render it unfit for good bread. The principal of\r\n    these are the blight, mildew, and smut, which are occasioned by\r\n    microscopic fungi, which sow themselves and grow upon the stems\r\n    and ears, destroying the nutritive principles, and introducing\r\n    matter of a deleterious kind. The farmer is at the utmost pains\r\n    to keep away these intruders. Wheat, as well as all kinds of\r\n    corn, is also very liable to be injured by being stacked before\r\n    it is quite dry; in which case it will heat, and become musty in\r\n    the ricks. In wet harvests it is sometimes impossible to get it\r\n    sufficiently dried, and a great deal of corn is thus often\r\n    spoiled. It is generally reckoned that the sweetest bread is\r\n    made from wheat threshed out before it is stacked; which shows\r\n    the importance of studying the best modes of preserving it.\r\n\r\n    The erudite are not agreed as to the aboriginal country of corn:\r\n    some say it is Egypt, others Tartary; and the learned Bailly, as\r\n    well as the traveller Pallas, affirms that it grows\r\n    spontaneously in Siberia. Be that as it may, the Phocians\r\n    brought it to Marseilles before the Romans had penetrated into\r\n    Gaul. The Gauls ate the corn cooked or bruised in a mortar: they\r\n    did not know, for a long time, how to make fermented bread.\r\n\r\nSCOTCH SHORTBREAD.\r\n\r\n1780. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of flour, 1 lb. of butter, 1/4 lb. of pounded\r\nloaf sugar, 1/2 oz. of caraway seeds, 1 oz. of sweet almonds, a few\r\nstrips of candied orange-peel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHORTBREAD.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat the butter to a cream, gradually dredge in the flour, and\r\nadd the sugar, caraway seeds, and sweet almonds, which should be\r\nblanched and cut into small pieces. Work the paste until it is quite\r\nsmooth, and divide it into six pieces. Put each cake on a separate piece\r\nof paper, roll the paste out square to the thickness of about an inch,\r\nand pinch it upon all sides. Prick it well, and ornament with one or two\r\nstrips of candied orange-peel. Put the cakes into a good oven, and bake\r\nthem from 25 to 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--25 to 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, for this quantity, 2s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 6 cakes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Where the flavour of the caraway seeds is disliked, omit them,\r\nand add rather a larger proportion of candied peel.\r\n\r\n\r\nSODA-CAKE.\r\n\r\n1781. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of butter, 1 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of\r\ncurrants, 1/2 lb. of moist sugar, 1 teacupful of milk, 3 eggs, 1\r\nteaspoonful of carbonate of soda.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the butter into the flour, add the currants and sugar, and\r\nmix these ingredients well together. Whisk the eggs well, stir them to\r\nthe flour, &c., with the milk, in which the soda should be previously\r\ndissolved, and beat the whole up together with a wooden spoon or beater.\r\nDivide the dough into two pieces, put them into buttered moulds or\r\ncake-tins, and bake in a moderate oven for nearly an hour. The mixture\r\nmust be extremely well beaten up, and not allowed to stand after the\r\nsoda is added to it, but must be placed in the oven immediately. Great\r\ncare must also be taken that the cakes are quite done through, which may\r\nbe ascertained by thrusting a knife into the middle of them: if the\r\nblade looks bright when withdrawn, they are done. If the tops acquire\r\ntoo much colour before the inside is sufficiently baked, cover them over\r\nwith a piece of clean white paper, to prevent them from burning.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 2 small cakes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVOY CAKE.\r\n\r\n1782. INGREDIENTS.--The weight of 4 eggs in pounded loaf sugar, the\r\nweight of 7 in flour, a little grated lemon-rind, or essence of almonds,\r\nor orange-flower water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Break the 7 eggs, putting the yolks into one basin and the\r\nwhites into another. Whisk the former, and mix with them the sugar, the\r\ngrated lemon-rind, or any other flavouring to taste; beat them well\r\ntogether, and add the whites of the eggs, whisked to a froth. Put in the\r\nflour by degrees, continuing to beat the mixture for 1/4 hour, butter a\r\nmould, pour in the cake, and bake it from 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour. This is a\r\nvery nice cake for dessert, and may be iced for a supper-table, or cut\r\ninto slices and spread with jam, which converts it into sandwiches.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 cake.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPONGE-CAKE.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPONGE-CAKE.]\r\n\r\n1783. INGREDIENTS.--The weight of 8 eggs in pounded loaf sugar, the\r\nweight of 5 in flour, the rind of 1 lemon, 1 tablespoonful of brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the eggs into one side of the scale, and take the weight of\r\n8 in pounded loaf sugar, and the weight of 5 in good _dry_ flour.\r\nSeparate the yolks from the whites of the eggs; beat the former, put\r\nthem into a saucepan with the sugar, and let them remain over the fire\r\nuntil _milk-warm,_ keeping them well stirred. Then put them into a\r\nbasin, add the grated lemon-rind mixed with the brandy, and stir these\r\nwell together, dredging in the flour very gradually. Whisk the whites of\r\nthe eggs to a very stiff froth, stir them to the flour, &c., and beat\r\nthe cake well for 1/4 hour. Put it into a buttered mould strewn with a\r\nlittle fine sifted sugar, and bake the cake in a quick oven for 1-1/2\r\nhour. Care must be taken that it is put into the oven immediately, or it\r\nwill not be light. The flavouring of this cake may be varied by adding a\r\nfew drops of essence of almonds instead of the grated lemon-rind.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 cake.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGYPTIAN WHEAT.]\r\n\r\n    The Egyptian, or Mummy Wheat, is not grown to any great extent,\r\n    owing to its inferior quality; but it is notable for its large\r\n    produce, and is often cultivated on allotment grounds and on\r\n    small farms, where quantity rather than quality is desired. At\r\n    Wix, in Essex, the seed of this wheat has produced, without\r\n    artificial assistance, four thousandfold; some of the ears have\r\n    had eleven offshoots, and have contained, altogether, eleven\r\n    grains in one ear.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n1784. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of loaf sugar, not quite 1/4 pint of water,\r\n5 eggs, 1 lemon, 1/2 lb. of flour, 1/4 teaspoonful of carbonate of soda.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the sugar and water together until they form a thick\r\nsyrup; let it cool a little, then pour it to the eggs, which should be\r\npreviously well whisked; and after the eggs and syrup are mixed\r\ntogether, continue beating them for a few minutes. Grate the lemon-rind,\r\nmix the carbonate of soda with the flour, and stir these lightly to the\r\nother ingredients; then add the lemon-juice, and, when the whole is\r\nthoroughly mixed, pour it into a buttered mould, and bake in rather a\r\nquick oven for rather more than 1 hour. The remains of sponge or Savoy\r\ncakes answer very well for trifles, light puddings, &c.; and a very\r\nstale one (if not mouldy) makes an excellent tipsy-cake.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Rather more than 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 1 cake.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE SMALL SPONGE-CAKES.\r\n\r\n1785. INGREDIENTS.--The weight of 5 eggs in flour, the weight of 8 in\r\npounded loaf sugar; flavouring to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the flour be perfectly dry, and the sugar well pounded and\r\nsifted. Separate the whites from the yolks of the eggs, and beat the\r\nlatter up with the sugar; then whisk the whites until they become rather\r\nstiff, and mix them with the yolks, but do not stir them more than is\r\njust necessary to mingle the ingredients well together. Dredge in the\r\nflour by degrees, add the flavouring; batter the tins well, pour in the\r\nbatter, sift a little sugar over the cakes, and bake them in rather a\r\nquick oven, but do not allow them to take too much colour, as they\r\nshould be rather pale. Remove them from the tins before they get cold,\r\nand turn them on their faces, where let them remain until quite cold,\r\nwhen store them away in a closed tin canister or wide-mouthed glass\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 to 15 minutes in a quick oven.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 1d. each.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEA-CAKES.\r\n\r\n1786. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of flour, 1/2 teaspoonful of salt, 1/4 lb. of\r\nbutter or lard, 1 egg, a piece of German yeast the size of a walnut,\r\nwarm milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the flour (which should be perfectly dry) into a basin mix\r\nwith it the salt, and rub in the butter or lard; then beat the egg well,\r\nstir to it the yeast, and add these to the flour with as much warm milk\r\nas will make the whole into a smooth paste, and knead it well. Let it\r\nrise near the fire, and, when well risen, form it into cakes; place them\r\non tins, let them rise again for a few minutes before putting them into\r\nthe oven, and bake from 1/4 to 1/2 hour in a moderate oven. These are\r\nvery nice with a few currants and a little sugar added to the other\r\ningredients: they should be put in after the butter is rubbed in. These\r\ncakes should be buttered, and eaten hot as soon as baked; but, when\r\nstale, they are very nice split and toasted; or, if dipped in milk, or\r\neven water, and covered with a basin in the oven till hot, they will be\r\nalmost equal to new.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 to 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 10d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 8 tea-cakes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO TOAST TEA-CAKES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEA-CAKES.]\r\n\r\n1787. Cut each tea-cake into three or four slices, according to its\r\nthickness; toast them on both sides before a nice clear fire, and as\r\neach slice is done, spread it with butter on both sides. When a cake is\r\ntoasted, pile the slices one on the top of the other, cut them into\r\nquarters, put them on a very hot plate, and send the cakes immediately\r\nto table. As they are wanted, send them in hot, one or two at a time,\r\nas, if allowed to stand, they spoil, unless kept in a muffin-plate over\r\na basin of boiling water.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NICE YEAST-CAKE.\r\n\r\n1788. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of flour, 1/2 lb. of butter, 1/2 pint of\r\nmilk, 1-1/2 tablespoonful of good yeast, 3 eggs, 3/4 lb. of currants,\r\n1/2 lb. of white moist sugar, 2 oz. of candied peel.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the milk and butter into a saucepan, and shake it round\r\nover a fire until the butter is melted, but do not allow the milk to get\r\nvery hot. Put the flour into a basin, stir to it the milk and butter,\r\nthe yeast, and eggs, which should be well beaten, and form the whole\r\ninto a smooth dough. Let it stand in a warm place, covered with a cloth,\r\nto rise, and, when sufficiently risen, add the currants, sugar, and\r\ncandied peel cut into thin slices. When all the ingredients are\r\nthoroughly mixed, line 2 moderate-sized cake-tins with buttered paper,\r\nwhich should be about six inches higher than the tin; pour in the\r\nmixture, let it stand to rise again for another 1/2 hour, and then bake\r\nthe cakes in a brisk oven for about 1-1/2 hour. If the tops of them\r\nbecome too brown, cover them with paper until they are done through. A\r\nfew drops of essence of lemon, or a little grated nutmeg, may be added\r\nwhen the flavour is liked.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hour. _Average cost_, 2s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 2 moderate-sized cakes.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON BEVERAGES.\r\n\r\n1789. Beverages are innumerable in their variety; but the ordinary\r\nbeverages drunk in the British isles, may be divided into three\r\nclasses:--1. Beverages of the simplest kind not fermented. 2. Beverages,\r\nconsisting of water, containing a considerable quantity of carbonic\r\nacid. 3. Beverages composed partly of fermented liquors. Of the first\r\nclass may be mentioned,--water, toast-and-water, barley-water, eau\r\nsucré, lait sucré, cheese and milk whey, milk-and-water, lemonade,\r\norangeade, sherbet, apple and pear juice, capillaire, vinegar-and-water,\r\nraspberry vinegar and water.\r\n\r\n1790. Of the common class of beverages, consisting of water impregnated\r\nwith carbonic acid gas, we may name soda-water, single and double,\r\nordinary effervescing draughts, and ginger-beer.\r\n\r\n1791. The beverages composed partly of fermented liquors, are hot spiced\r\nwines, bishop, egg-flip, egg-hot, ale posset, sack posset, punch, and\r\nspirits-and-water.\r\n\r\n1792. We will, however, forthwith treat on the most popular of our\r\nbeverages, beginning with the one which makes \"the cup that cheers but\r\nnot inebriates.\"\r\n\r\n1793. The beverage called tea has now become almost a necessary of life.\r\nPrevious to the middle of the 17th century it was not used in England,\r\nand it was wholly unknown to the Greeks and Romans. Pepys says, in his\r\nDiary,--\"September 25th, 1661.--I sent for a cup of tea (a China drink),\r\nof which I had never drunk before.\" Two years later it was so rare a\r\ncommodity in England, that the English East-India Company bought 2 lbs.\r\n2 oz. of it, as a present for his majesty. In 1666 it was sold in London\r\nfor sixty shillings a pound. From that date the consumption has gone on\r\nincreasing from 5,000 lbs. to 50,000,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n1794. Linnaeus was induced to think that there were two species of\r\ntea-plant, one of which produced the black, and the other the green\r\nteas; but later observations do not confirm this. When the leaves of\r\nblack and green tea are expanded by hot water, and examined by the\r\nbotanist, though a difference of character is perceived, yet this is not\r\nsufficient to authorize considering them as distinct species. The\r\ntea-tree flourishes best in temperate regions; in China it is\r\nindigenous. The part of China where the best tea is cultivated, is\r\ncalled by us the \"tea country.\" The cultivation of the plant requires\r\ngreat care. It is raised chiefly on the sides of hills; and, in order to\r\nincrease the quantity and improve the quality of the leaves, the shrub\r\nis pruned, so as not to exceed the height of from two to three feet,\r\nmuch in the same manner as the vine is treated in France. They pluck the\r\nleaves, one selecting them according to the kinds of tea required; and,\r\nnotwithstanding the tediousness of the operation, each labourer is able\r\nto gather from four to ten or fifteen pounds a day. When the trees\r\nattain to six or seven years of age, the produce becomes so inferior\r\nthat they are removed to make room for a fresh succession, or they are\r\ncut down to allow of numerous young shoots. Teas of the finest flavour\r\nconsist of the youngest leaves; and as these are gathered at four\r\ndifferent periods of the year, the younger the leaves the higher\r\nflavoured the tea, and the scarcer, and consequently the dearer, the\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n1795. The various names by which teas are sold in the British market are\r\ncorruptions of Chinese words. There are about a dozen different kinds;\r\nbut the principal are Bohea, Congou, and Souchong, and signify,\r\nrespectively, inferior, middling, and superior. Teas are often perfumed\r\nand flavoured with the leaves of different kinds of plants grown on\r\npurpose. Different tea-farms in China produce teas of various qualities,\r\nraised by skilful cultivation on various soils.\r\n\r\n1796. Tea, when chemically analyzed, is found to contain woody fibre,\r\nmucilage, a considerable quantity of the astringent principle, or\r\ntannin, a narcotic principle, which is, perhaps, connected with a\r\npeculiar aroma. The tannin is shown by its striking a black colour with\r\nsulphate of iron, and is the cause of the dark stain which is always\r\nformed when tea is spilt upon buff-coloured cottons dyed with iron. A\r\nconstituent called _Theine_ has also been discovered in tea, supposed to\r\nbe identical with _Caffeine_, one of the constituents of coffee. Liebig\r\nsays, \"Theine yields, in certain processes of decomposition, a series of\r\nmost remarkable products, which have much analogy with those derived\r\nfrom uric acid in similar circumstances. The infusion of tea differs\r\nfrom that of coffee, by containing iron and manganese. We have in tea,\r\nof many kinds, a beverage which contains the active constituents of the\r\nmost powerful mineral springs, and, however small the amount of iron may\r\nbe which we daily take in this form, it cannot be destitute of influence\r\non the vital processes.\"\r\n\r\n1797. Chinese tea has frequently been adulterated in this country, by\r\nthe admixture of the dried leaves of certain plants. The leaves of the\r\nsloe, white thorn, ash, elder, and some others, have been employed for\r\nthis purpose; such as the leaves of the speedwell, wild germander, black\r\ncurrants, syringa, purple-spiked willow-herb, sweet-brier, and\r\ncherry-tree. Some of these are harmless, others are to a certain degree\r\npoisonous; as, for example, are the leaves of all the varieties of the\r\nplum and cherry tribe, to which the sloe belongs. Adulteration by means\r\nof these leaves is by no means a new species of fraud; and several acts\r\nof parliament, from the time of George II., have been passed, specifying\r\nsevere penalties against those guilty of the offence, which,\r\nnotwithstanding numerous convictions, continues to the present time.\r\n\r\n1798. In the purchase of tea, that should be chosen which possesses an\r\nagreeable odour and is as whole as possible, in order that the leaf may\r\nbe easily examined. The greatest care should be taken that it has not\r\nbeen exposed to the air, which destroys its flavour.\r\n\r\n1799. It would be impossible, in the space at our command, to enumerate\r\nthe various modes adopted in different countries for \"making coffee;\"\r\nthat is, the phrase commonly understood to mean the complete preparation\r\nof this delicious beverage for drinking. For performing this operation,\r\nsuch recipes or methods as we have found most practical will be inserted\r\nin their proper place; but the following facts connected with coffee\r\nwill be found highly interesting.\r\n\r\n1800. The introduction of coffee into this country is comparatively of\r\nrecent date. We are assured by Bruce that the coffee-tree is a native of\r\nAbyssinia, and it is said to have been cultivated in that country from\r\ntime immemorial.\r\n\r\n1801. It appears that coffee was first introduced into England by Daniel\r\nEdwards, a Turkey merchant, whose servant, Pasqua, a Greek, understood\r\nthe manner of roasting it. This servant, under the patronage of Edwards,\r\nestablished the first coffee-house in London, in George Yard, Lombard\r\nStreet. Coffee was then sold at four or five guineas a pound, and a duty\r\nwas soon afterwards laid upon it of fourpence a gallon, when made into a\r\nbeverage. In the course of two centuries, however, this berry, unknown\r\noriginally as an article of food, except to some savage tribes on the\r\nconfines of Abyssinia, has made its way through the whole of the\r\ncivilized world. Mahommedans of all ranks drink coffee twice a day; it\r\nis in universal request in France; and the demand for it throughout the\r\nBritish isles is daily increasing, the more especially since so much\r\nattention has been given to mechanical contrivances for roasting and\r\ngrinding the berry and preparing the beverage.\r\n\r\n1802. Of the various kinds of coffee the Arabian is considered the best.\r\nIt is grown chiefly in the districts of Aden and Mocha; whence the name\r\nof our Mocha coffee. Mocha coffee has a smaller and rounder bean than\r\nany other, and likewise a more agreeable smell and taste. The next in\r\nreputation and quality is the Java and Ceylon coffee, and then the\r\ncoffees of Bourbon and Martinique, and that of Berbice, a district of\r\nthe colony of British Guiana. The Jamaica and St. Domingo coffees are\r\nless esteemed.\r\n\r\n1803. A considerable change takes place in the arrangement of the\r\nconstituents of coffee by the application of heat in roasting it.\r\nIndependently of one of the objects of roasting, namely, that of\r\ndestroying its toughness and rendering it easily ground, its tannin and\r\nother principles are rendered partly soluble in water; and it is to the\r\ntannin that the brown colour of the decoction of coffee is owing. An\r\naromatic flavour is likewise developed during torrefaction, which is not\r\nperceived in the raw berry, and which is not produced in the greatest\r\nperfection until the heat has arrived at a certain degree of\r\ntemperature; but, if the heat be increased beyond this, the flavour is\r\nagain dissipated, and little remains but a bitter and astringent matter\r\nwith carbon.\r\n\r\n1804. The roasting of coffee in the best manner requires great nicety,\r\nand much of the qualities of the beverage depends upon the operation.\r\nThe roasting of coffee for the dealers in London and Paris has now\r\nbecome a separate branch of business, and some of the roasters perform\r\nthe operation on a great scale, with considerable skill. Roasted coffee\r\nloses from 20 to 30 per cent, by sufficient roasting, and the powder\r\nsuffers much by exposure to the air; but, while raw, it not only does\r\nnot lose its flavour for a year or two, but improves by keeping. If a\r\ncup of the best coffee be placed upon a table boiling hot, it will fill\r\nthe room with its fragrance; but the coffee, when warmed again after\r\nbeing cold, will be found to have lost most of its flavour.\r\n\r\n1805. To have coffee in perfection, it should be roasted and ground just\r\nbefore it is used, and more should not be ground at a time than is\r\nwanted for immediate use, or, if it be necessary to grind more, it\r\nshould be kept closed from the air. Coffee readily imbibes exhalations\r\nfrom other substances, and thus often acquires a bad flavour: brown\r\nsugar placed near it will communicate a disagreeable flavour. It is\r\nstated that the coffee in the West Indies has often been injured by\r\nbeing laid in rooms near the sugar-works, or where rum is distilled; and\r\nthe same effect has been produced by bringing over coffee in the same\r\nships with rum and sugar. Dr. Moseley mentions that a few bags of\r\npepper, on board a ship from India, spoiled a whole cargo of coffee.\r\n\r\n1806. With respect to the quantity of coffee used in making the\r\ndecoction, much depends upon the taste of the consumer. The greatest and\r\nmost common fault in English coffee is the too small quantity of the\r\ningredient. Count Rumford says that to make good coffee for drinking\r\nafter dinner, a pound of good Mocha coffee, which, when roasted and\r\nground, weighs only thirteen ounces, serves to make fifty-six full cups,\r\nor a little less than a quarter of an ounce to a coffee-cup of moderate\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE CHOCOLATE.\r\n\r\n1807. INGREDIENTS.--Allow 1/2 oz. of chocolate to each person; to every\r\noz. allow 1/2 pint of water, 1/2 pint of milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Make the milk-and-water hot; scrape the chocolate into it, and\r\nstir the mixture constantly and quickly until the chocolate is\r\ndissolved; bring it to the boiling-point, stir it well, and serve\r\ndirectly with white sugar. Chocolate prepared with in a mill, as shown\r\nin the engraving, is made by putting in the scraped chocolate, pouring\r\nover it the boiling milk-and-water, and milling it over the fire until\r\nhot and frothy.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1/2 oz. of cake chocolate to each person.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILL.]\r\n\r\n    CHOCOLATE AND COCOA.--Both these preparations are made from the\r\n    seeds or beans of the cacao-tree, which grows in the West Indies\r\n    and South America. The Spanish, and the proper name, is cacao,\r\n    not cocoa, as it is generally spelt. From this mistake, the tree\r\n    from which the beverage is procured has been often confounded\r\n    with the palm that produces the edible cocoa-nuts, which are the\r\n    produce of the cocoa-tree (_Cocos nucifera_), whereas the tree\r\n    from which chocolate is procured is very different (the\r\n    _Theobroma cacao_). The cocoa-tree was cultivated by the\r\n    aboriginal inhabitants of South America, particularly in Mexico,\r\n    where, according to Humboldt, it was reared by Montezuma. It was\r\n    transplanted thence into other dependencies of the Spanish\r\n    monarchy in 1520; and it was so highly esteemed by Linnaeus\r\n    receive from him the name now conferred upon it, of Theobroma, a\r\n    term derived from the Greek, and signifying \"_food for gods_.\"\r\n    Chocolate has always been a favourite beverage among the\r\n    Spaniards and Creoles, and was considered here as a great luxury\r\n    when first introduced, after the discovery of America; but the\r\n    high duties laid upon it, confined it long almost entirely to\r\n    the wealthier classes. Before it was subjected to duty, Mr.\r\n    Bryan Edwards stated that cocoa plantations were numerous in\r\n    Jamaica, but that the duty caused their almost entire ruin. The\r\n    removal of this duty has increased their cultivation. (For\r\n    engraving of cocoa-bean, _see_ No. 1816.)\r\n\r\nTO MAKE ESSENCE OF COFFEE.\r\n\r\n1808. INGREDIENTS.--To every 1/4 lb. of ground coffee allow 1 small\r\nteaspoonful of powdered chicory, 3 small teacupfuls, or 1 pint, of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the coffee be freshly ground, and, if possible, freshly\r\nroasted; put it into a percolater, or filter, with the chicory, and pour\r\n_slowly_ over it the above proportion of boiling water. When it has all\r\nfiltered through, warm the coffee sufficiently to bring it to the\r\nsimmering-point, but do not allow it to boil; then filter it a second\r\ntime, put it into a clean and dry bottle, cork it well, and it will\r\nremain good for several days. Two tablespoonfuls of this essence are\r\nquite sufficient for a breakfast-cupful of hot milk. This essence will\r\nbe found particularly useful to those persons who have to rise extremely\r\nearly; and having only the milk to make boiling, is very easily and\r\nquickly prepared. When the essence is bottled, pour another 3\r\ntea-cupfuls of _boiling_ water slowly on the grounds, which, when\r\nfiltered through, will be a very weak coffee. The next time there is\r\nessence to be prepared, make this weak coffee boiling, and pour it on\r\nthe ground coffee instead of plain water: by this means a better coffee\r\nwill be obtained. Never throw away the grounds without having made use\r\nof them in this manner; and always cork the bottle well that contains\r\nthis preparation, until the day that it is wanted for making the fresh\r\nessence.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To be filtered once, then brought to the boiling-point, and\r\nfiltered again.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, with coffee at 1s. 8d. per lb., 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient'_-Allow 2 tablespoonfuls for a breakfast-cupful of hot milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROAST COFFEE.\r\n\r\n(_A French Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n1809. It being an acknowledged fact that French coffee is decidedly\r\nsuperior to that made in England, and as the roasting of the berry is of\r\ngreat importance to the flavour of the preparation, it will be useful\r\nand interesting to know how they manage these things in France. In\r\nParis, there are two houses justly celebrated for the flavour of their\r\ncoffee,--_La Maison Corcellet_ and _La Maison Royer de Chartres_; and to\r\nobtain this flavour, before roasting they add to every 3 lbs. of coffee\r\na piece of butter the size of a nut, and a dessert-spoonful of powdered\r\nsugar: it is then roasted in the usual manner. The addition of the\r\nbutter and sugar develops the flavour and aroma of the berry; but it\r\nmust be borne in mind, that the quality of the butter must be of the\r\nvery best description.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE COFFEE.\r\n\r\n1810. INGREDIENTS.--Allow 4 oz., or 1 tablespoonful, of ground coffee to\r\neach person; to every oz. of coffee allow 1/3 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--To make coffee good, _it should never be boiled_, but the\r\nboiling water merely poured on it, the same as for tea. The coffee\r\nshould always be purchased in the berry,--if possible, freshly roasted;\r\nand it should never be ground long before it is wanted for use. There\r\nare very many new kinds of coffee-pots, but the method of making the\r\ncoffee is nearly always the same; namely, pouring the boiling water on\r\nthe powder, and allowing it to filter through. Our illustration shows\r\none of Loysel's Hydrostatic Urns, which are admirably adapted for making\r\ngood and clear coffee, which should be made in the following,\r\nmanner:--Warm the urn with boiling water, remove the lid and movable\r\nfilter, and place the ground coffee at the bottom of the urn. Put the\r\nmovable filter over this, and screw the lid, inverted, tightly on the\r\nend of the centre pipe. Pour into the inverted lid the above proportion\r\nof boiling water, and when all the water so poured has disappeared from\r\nthe funnel, and made its way down the centre pipe and up again through\r\nthe ground coffee by _hydrostatic pressure_, unscrew screw the lid and\r\ncover the urn. Pour back direct into the urn, _not through the funnel_,\r\none, two, or three cups, according to the size of the percolater, in\r\norder to make the infusion of uniform strength; the contents will then\r\nbe ready for use, and should run from the tap strong, hot, and clear.\r\nThe coffee made in these urns generally turns out very good, and there\r\nis but one objection to them,--the coffee runs rather slowly from the\r\ntap. This is of no consequence where there is a small party, but tedious\r\nwhere there are many persons to provide for. A remedy for this objection\r\nmay be suggested; namely, to make the coffee very strong, so that not\r\nmore than 1/3 of a cup would be required, as the rest would be filled up\r\nwith milk. Making coffee in filters or percolaters does away with the\r\nnecessity of using isinglass, white of egg, and various other\r\npreparations to clear it. Coffee should always be served very hot, and,\r\nif possible, in the same vessel in which it is made, as pouring it from\r\none pot to another cools, and consequently spoils it. Many persons may\r\nthink that the proportion of water we have given for each oz. of coffee\r\nis rather small; it is so, and the coffee produced from it will be very\r\nstrong; 1/3 of a cup will be found quite sufficient, which should be\r\nfilled with nice hot milk, or milk and cream mixed. This is the 'cafe au\r\nlait' for which our neighbours over the Channel are so justly\r\ncelebrated. Should the ordinary method of making coffee be preferred,\r\nuse double the quantity of water, and, in pouring it into the cups, put\r\nin more coffee and less milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOYSEL'S HYDROSTATIC URN.]\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--For very good coffee, allow 1/2 oz., or 1 tablespoonful,\r\nto each person.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VERY SIMPLE METHOD OF MAKING COFFEE.\r\n\r\n1811. INGREDIENTS.--Allow 1/2 oz., or 1 tablespoonful, of coffee to each\r\nperson; to every oz. allow 1 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have a small iron ring made to fit the top of the coffee-pot\r\ninside, and to this ring sew a small muslin bag (the muslin for the\r\npurpose must not be too thin). Fit the bag into the pot, pour some\r\nboiling water in it, and, when the pot is well warmed, put the ground\r\ncoffee into the bag; pour over as much boiling water as is required,\r\nclose the lid, and, when all the water has filtered through, remove the\r\nbag, and send the coffee to table. Making it in this manner prevents the\r\nnecessity of pouring the coffee from one vessel to another, which cools\r\nand spoils it. The water should be poured on the coffee gradually, so\r\nthat the infusion may be stronger; and the bag must be well made, that\r\nnone of the grounds may escape through the seams, and so make the coffee\r\nthick and muddy.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 tablespoonful, or 1/2 oz., to each person.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE.]\r\n\r\n    THE COFFEE PLANT grows to the height of about twelve or fifteen\r\n    feet, with leaves not unlike those of the common laurel,\r\n    although more pointed, and not so dry and thick. The blossoms\r\n    are white, much like those of jasmine, and issue from the angles\r\n    of the leaf-stalks. When the flowers fade, they are succeeded by\r\n    the coffee-bean, or seed, which is inclosed in a berry of a red\r\n    colour, when ripe resembling a cherry. The coffee-beans are\r\n    prepared by exposing them to the sun for a few days, that the\r\n    pulp may ferment and throw off a strong acidulous moisture. They\r\n    are then gradually dried for about three weeks, and put into a\r\n    mill to separate the husk from the seed.\r\n\r\nCAFE AU LAIT.\r\n\r\n1812. This is merely very strong coffee added to a large proportion of\r\ngood hot milk; about 6 tablespoonfuls of strong coffee being quite\r\nsufficient for a breakfast-cupful of milk. Of the essence No. 1808,\r\nwhich answers admirably for 'cafe an lait', so much would not be\r\nrequired. This preparation is infinitely superior to the weak watery\r\ncoffee so often served at English tables. A little cream mixed with the\r\nmilk, if the latter cannot be depended on for richness, improves the\r\ntaste of the coffee, as also the richness of the beverage.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--6 tablespoonfuls of strong coffee, or 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\nthe essence, to a breakfast-cupful of milk.\r\n\r\n    TEA AND COFFEE.--It is true, says Liebig, that thousands have\r\n    lived without a knowledge of tea and coffee; and daily\r\n    experience teaches us that, under certain circumstances, they\r\n    may be dispensed with without disadvantage to the merely animal\r\n    functions; but it is an error, certainly, to conclude from this\r\n    that they may be altogether dispensed with in reference to their\r\n    effects; and it is a question whether, if we had no tea and no\r\n    coffee, the popular instinct would not seek for and discover the\r\n    means of replacing them. Science, which accuses us of so much in\r\n    these respects, will have, in the first place, to ascertain\r\n    whether it depends on sensual and sinful inclinations merely,\r\n    that every people of the globe have appropriated some such means\r\n    of acting on the nervous life, from the shore of the Pacific,\r\n    where the Indian retires from life for days in order to enjoy\r\n    the bliss of intoxication with koko, to the Arctic regions,\r\n    where Kamtschatdales and Koriakes prepare an intoxicating\r\n    beverage from a poisonous mushroom. We think it, on the\r\n    contrary, highly probable, not to say certain, that the instinct\r\n    of man, feeling certain blanks, certain wants of the intensified\r\n    life of our times, which cannot be satisfied or filled up by\r\n    mere quantity, has discovered, in these products of vegetable\r\n    life the true means of giving to his food the desired and\r\n    necessary quality.\r\n\r\nCAFE NOIR.\r\n\r\n1813. This is usually handed round after dinner, and should be drunk\r\nwell sweetened, with the addition of a little brandy or liqueurs, which\r\nmay be added or not at pleasure. The coffee should be made very strong,\r\nand served in very small cups, but never mixed with milk or cream. Cafe\r\nnoir may be made of the essence of coffee No. 1808, by pouring a\r\ntablespoonful into each cup, and filling it up with boiling water. This\r\nis a very simple and expeditious manner of preparing coffee for a large\r\nparty, but the essence for it must be made very good, and kept well\r\ncorked until required for use.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE TEA.\r\n\r\n1814. There is very little art in making good tea; if the water is\r\nboiling, and there is no sparing of the fragrant leaf, the beverage will\r\nalmost invariably be good. The old-fashioned plan of allowing a\r\nteaspoonful to each person, and one over, is still practised. Warm the\r\nteapot with boiling water; let it remain for two or three minutes for\r\nthe vessel to become thoroughly hot, then pour it away. Put in the tea,\r\npour in from 1/2 to 3/4 pint of boiling water, close the lid, and let it\r\nstand for the tea to draw from 5 to 10 minutes; then fill up the pot\r\nwith water. The tea will be quite spoiled unless made with water that is\r\nactually 'boiling', as the leaves will not open, and the flavour not be\r\nextracted from them; the beverage will consequently be colourless and\r\ntasteless,--in fact, nothing but tepid water. Where there is a very\r\nlarge party to make tea for, it is a good plan to have two teapots\r\ninstead of putting a large quantity of tea into one pot; the tea,\r\nbesides, will go farther. When the infusion has been once completed, the\r\naddition of fresh tea adds very little to the strength; so, when more is\r\nrequired, have the pot emptied of the old leaves, scalded, and fresh tea\r\nmade in the usual manner. Economists say that a few grains of carbonate\r\nof soda, added before the boiling water is poured on the tea, assist to\r\ndraw out the goodness: if the water is very hard, perhaps it is a good\r\nplan, as the soda softens it; but care must be taken to use this\r\ningredient sparingly, as it is liable to give the tea a soapy taste if\r\nadded in too large a quantity. For mixed tea, the usual proportion is\r\nfour spoonfuls of black to one of green; more of the latter when the\r\nflavour is very much liked; but strong green tea is highly pernicious,\r\nand should never be partaken of too freely.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 minutes to warm the teapot, 5 to 10 minutes to draw the\r\nstrength from the tea.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 teaspoonful to each person, and one over.\r\n\r\n    TEA.--The tea-tree or shrub belongs to the class and order of\r\n    Monadelphia polyandria in the Linnaean system, and to the\r\n    natural order of Aurantiaceae in the system of Jussieu. Lately\r\n    it has been made into a new order, the Theasia, which includes\r\n    the Camellia and some other plants. It commonly grows to the\r\n    height of from three to six feet; but it is said, that, in its\r\n    wild or native state, it reaches twenty feet or more. In China\r\n    it is cultivated in numerous small plantations. In its general\r\n    appearance, and the form of its leaf, it resembles the myrtle.\r\n    The blossoms are white and fragrant, not unlike those of the\r\n    wild rose, but smaller; and they are succeeded by soft green\r\n    capsules, containing each from one to three white seeds. These\r\n    capsules are crushed for oil, which is in general use in China.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEA.]\r\n\r\nAN EXCELLENT SUBSTITUTE FOR MILK OR CREAM IN TEA OR COFFEE.\r\n\r\n1815. INGREDIENTS.--Allow 1 new-laid egg to every large breakfast-cupful\r\nof tea or coffee.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat up the whole of the egg in a basin, put it into a cup (or\r\na portion of it, if the cup be small), and pour over it the tea or\r\ncoffee very hot. These should be added very gradually, and stirred all\r\nthe time, to prevent the egg from curdling. In point of nourishment,\r\nboth these beverages are much improved by this addition.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 egg to every large breakfast-cupful of tea or\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE COCOA.\r\n\r\n1816. INGREDIENTS.--Allow 2 teaspoonfuls of the prepared cocoa to 1\r\nbreakfast-cup; boiling milk and boiling water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCOA-BEAN.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the cocoa into a breakfast-cup, pour over it sufficient\r\ncold milk to make it into a smooth paste; then add equal quantities of\r\nboiling milk and boiling water, and stir all well together. Care must be\r\ntaken not to allow the milk to get burnt, as it will entirely spoil the\r\nflavour of the preparation. The above directions are usually given for\r\nmaking the prepared cocoa. The rock cocoa, or that bought in a solid\r\npiece, should be scraped, and made in the same manner, taking care to\r\nrub down all the lumps before the boiling liquid is added.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_--2 teaspoonfuls of prepared cocoa for 1 breakfast-cup, or\r\n1/4 oz. of the rock cocoa for the same quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWSLIP WINE.\r\n\r\n1817. INGREDIENTS.--To every gallon of water allow 3 lbs. of lump sugar,\r\nthe rind of 2 lemons, the juice of 1, the rind and juice of 1 Seville\r\norange, 1 gallon of cowslip pips. To every 4-1/2 gallons of wine allow 1\r\nbottle of brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the sugar and water together for 1/2 hour, carefully\r\nremoving all the scum as it rises. Pour this boiling liquor on the\r\norange and lemon-rinds, and the juice, which should be strained; when\r\nmilk-warm, add the cowslip pips or flowers, picked from the stalks and\r\nseeds; and to 9 gallons of wine 3 tablespoonfuls of good fresh brewers'\r\nyeast. Let it ferment 3 or 4 days; then put all together in a cask with\r\nthe brandy, and let it remain for 2 months, when bottle it off for use.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To be boiled 1/2 hour; to ferment 3 or 4 days; to remain in the\r\ncask 2 months.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, exclusive of the cowslips, which may be picked in the\r\nfields, 2s. 9d. per gallon.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in April or May.\r\n\r\n\r\nELDER WINE.\r\n\r\n1818. INGREDIENTS.--To every 3 gallons of water allow 1 peck of\r\nelderberries; to every gallon of juice allow 3 lbs. of sugar, 1/2 oz. of\r\nground ginger, 6 cloves, 1 lb. of good Turkey raisins; 1/2 pint of\r\nbrandy to every gallon of wine. To every 9 gallons of wine 3 or 4\r\ntablespoonfuls of fresh brewer's yeast.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pour the water, quite boiling, on the elderberries, which\r\nshould be picked from the stalks, and let these stand covered for 24\r\nhours; then strain the whole through a sieve or bag, breaking the fruit\r\nto express all the juice from it. Measure the liquor, and to every\r\ngallon allow the above proportion of sugar. Boil the juice and sugar\r\nwith the ginger, cloves, and raisins for 1 hour, skimming the liquor the\r\nwhole time; let it stand until milk-warm, then put it into a clean dry\r\ncask, with 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of good fresh yeast to every 9 gallons\r\nof wine. Let it ferment for about a fortnight; then add the brandy, bung\r\nup the cask, and let it stand some months before it is bottled, when it\r\nwill be found excellent. A bunch of hops suspended to a string from the\r\nbung, some persons say, will preserve the wine good for several years.\r\nElder wine is usually mulled, and served with sippets of toasted bread\r\nand a little grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To stand covered 24 hours; to be boiled 1 hour.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, when made at home, 3s. 6d. per gallon.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in September.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELDER-BERRIES.]\r\n\r\n    ELDER-BERRY WINE.--The elder-berry is well adapted for the\r\n    production of wine; its juice contains a considerable portion of\r\n    the principle necessary for a vigorous fermentation, and its\r\n    beautiful colour communicates a rich tint to the wine made from\r\n    it. It is, however, deficient in sweetness, and therefore\r\n    demands an addition of sugar. It is one of the very best of the\r\n    genuine old English wines; and a cup of it mulled, just previous\r\n    to retiring to bed on a winter night, is a thing to be \"run\r\n    for,\" as Cobbett would say: it is not, however, agreeable to\r\n    every taste.\r\n\r\nGINGER WINE.\r\n\r\n1819. INGREDIENTS.--To 9 gallons of water allow 27 lbs. of loaf sugar, 9\r\nlemons, 12 oz. of bruised ginger, 3 tablespoonfuls of yeast, 2 lbs. of\r\nraisins stoned and chopped, 1 pint of brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil together for 1 hour in a copper (let it previously be well\r\nscoured and beautifully clean) the water, sugar, _lemon-rinds_, and\r\nbruised ginger; remove every particle of scum as it rises, and when the\r\nliquor is sufficiently boiled, put it into a large tub or pan, as it\r\nmust not remain in the copper. When nearly cold, add the yeast, which\r\nmust be thick and very fresh, and, the next day, put all in a dry cask\r\nwith the strained lemon-juice and chopped raisins. Stir the wine every\r\nday for a fortnight; then add the brandy, stop the cask down by degrees,\r\nand in a few weeks it will be fit to bottle.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. per gallon. _Sufficient_ to make 9 gallons of wine.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--The best time for making this wine is either in March or\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Wine made early in March will be fit to bottle in June.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRY VINEGAR.\r\n\r\n(_An Excellent Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n1820. INGREDIENTS.--2 pecks of crystal gooseberries, 6 gallons of water,\r\n12 lbs. of foots sugar of the coarsest brown quality.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mash the gooseberries (which should be quite ripe) in a tub\r\nwith a mallet; put to them the water nearly milk-warm; let this stand 24\r\nhours; then strain it through a sieve, and put the sugar to it; mix it\r\nwell, and tun it. These proportions are for a 9-gallon cask; and if it\r\nbe not quite full, more water must be added. Let the mixture be stirred\r\nfrom the bottom of the cask two or three times daily for three or four\r\ndays, to assist the melting of the sugar; then paste a piece of linen\r\ncloth over the bunghole, and set the cask in a warm place, _but not in\r\nthe sun_; any corner of a warm kitchen is the best situation for it. The\r\nfollowing spring it should be drawn off into stone bottles, and the\r\nvinegar will be fit for use twelve months after it is made. This will be\r\nfound a most excellent preparation, greatly superior to much that is\r\nsold under the name of the best white wine vinegar. Many years'\r\nexperience has proved that pickle made with this vinegar will keep, when\r\nbought vinegar will not preserve the ingredients. The cost per gallon is\r\nmerely nominal, especially to those who reside in the country and grow\r\ntheir own gooseberries; the coarse sugar is then the only ingredient to\r\nbe purchased.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To remain in the cask 9 months.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, when the gooseberries have to be purchased, 1s. per\r\ngallon; when they are grown at home, 6d. per gallon.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This should be made the end of June or the beginning of\r\nJuly, when gooseberries are ripe and plentiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFERVESCING GOOSEBERRY WINE.\r\n\r\n1821. INGREDIENTS.--To every gallon of water allow 6 lbs. of green\r\ngooseberries, 3 lbs. of lump sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--This wine should be prepared from unripe gooseberries, in order\r\nto avoid the flavour which the fruit would give to the wine when in a\r\nmature state. Its briskness depends more upon the time of bottling than\r\nupon the unripe state of the fruit, for effervescing wine can be made\r\nfrom fruit that is ripe as well as that which is unripe. The fruit\r\nshould be selected when it has nearly attained its full growth, and\r\nconsequently before it shows any tendency to ripen. Any bruised or\r\ndecayed berries, and those that are very small, should be rejected. The\r\nblossom and stalk ends should be removed, and the fruit well bruised in\r\na tub or pan, in such quantities as to insure each berry being broken\r\nwithout crushing the seeds. Pour the water (which should be warm) on the\r\nfruit, squeeze and stir it with the hand until all the pulp is removed\r\nfrom the skin and seeds, and cover the whole closely for 24 hours; after\r\nwhich, strain it through a coarse bag, and press it with as much force\r\nas can be conveniently applied, to extract the whole of the juice and\r\nliquor the fruit may contain. To every 40 or 50 lbs. of fruit one gallon\r\nmore of hot water may be passed through the marc, or husks, in order to\r\nobtain any soluble matter that may remain, and be again pressed. The\r\njuice should be put into a tub or pan of sufficient size to contain all\r\nof it, and the sugar added to it. Let it be well stirred until the sugar\r\nis dissolved, and place the pan in a warm situation; keep it closely\r\ncovered, and let it ferment for a day or two. It must then be drawn off\r\ninto clean casks, placed a little on one side for the scum that arises\r\nto be thrown out, and the casks kept filled with the remaining \"must,\"\r\nthat should be reserved for that purpose. When the active fermentation\r\nhas ceased, the casks should be plugged upright, again filled, if\r\nnecessary, the bungs be put in loosely, and, after a few days, when the\r\nfermentation is a little more languid (which may be known, by the\r\nhissing noise ceasing), the bungs should be driven in tight, and a\r\nspile-hole made, to give vent if necessary. About November or December,\r\non a clear fine day, the wine should he racked from its lees into clean\r\ncasks, which may be rinsed with brandy. After a month, it should be\r\nexamined to see if it is sufficiently clear for bottling; if not, it\r\nmust be fined with isinglass, which may be dissolved in some of the\r\nwine: 1 oz. will be sufficient for 9 gallons. In March or April, or when\r\nthe gooseberry bushes begin to blossom, the wine must be bottled, in\r\norder to insure its being effervescing.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this the end of May or beginning of June, before the\r\nberries ripen.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON SYRUP.\r\n\r\n1822. INGREDIENTS.--2 lbs. of loaf sugar, 2 pints of water, 1 oz. of\r\ncitric acid, 12 drachm of essence of lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the sugar and water together for 1/4 hour, and put it into\r\na basin, where let it remain till cold. Beat the citric acid to a\r\npowder, mix the essence of lemon with it, then add these two ingredients\r\nto the syrup; mix well, and bottle for use. Two tablespoonfuls of the\r\nsyrup are sufficient for a tumbler of cold water, and will be found a\r\nvery refreshing summer drink.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_--2 tablespoonfuls of syrup to a tumbler-ful of cold water.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON WINE.\r\n\r\n1823. INGREDIENTS.--To 4-1/2 gallons of water allow the pulp of 50\r\nlemons, the rind of 25, 16 lbs. of loaf sugar,--1/2 oz. of isinglass, 1\r\nbottle of brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel and slice the lemons, but use only the rind of 25 of them,\r\nand put them into the cold water. Let it stand 8 or 9 days, squeezing\r\nthe lemons well every day; then strain the water off and put it into a\r\ncask with the sugar. Let it work some time, and when it has ceased\r\nworking, put in the isinglass. Stop the cask down; in about six months\r\nput in the brandy and bottle the wine off.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--The best time to make this is in January or February,\r\nwhen lemons are best and cheapest.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALT WINE.\r\n\r\n1824. INGREDIENTS.--5 gallons of water, 28 lbs. of sugar, 6 quarts of\r\nsweet-wort, 6 quarts of tun, 3 lbs. of raisins, 1/2 lb. of candy, 1 pint\r\nof brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Boil the sugar and water together for 10 minutes; skim it well,\r\nand put the liquor into a convenient-sized pan or tub. Allow it to cool;\r\nthen mix it with the sweet-wort and tun. Let it stand for 3 days, then\r\nput it into a barrel; here it will work or ferment for another three\r\ndays or more; then bung up the cask, and keep it undisturbed for 2 or 3\r\nmonths. After this, add the raisins (whole), the candy, and brandy, and,\r\nin 6 months' time, bottle the wine off. Those who do not brew, may\r\nprocure the sweet-wort and tun from any brewer. Sweet-wort is the liquor\r\nthat leaves the mash of malt before it is boiled with the hops; tun is\r\nthe new beer after the whole of the brewing operation has been\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To be boiled 10 minutes; to stand 3 days after mixing; to\r\nferment 3 days; to remain in the cask 2 mouths before the raisins are\r\nadded; bottle 6 months after.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in March or October.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME-MADE NOYEAU.\r\n\r\n1825. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of bitter almonds, 1 oz. of sweet ditto, 1 lb.\r\nof loaf sugar, the rinds of 3 lemons, 1 quart of Irish whiskey or gin, 1\r\ntablespoonful of clarified honey, 4 pint of new milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Blanch and pound the almonds, and mix with them the sugar,\r\nwhich should also be pounded. Boil the milk; let it stand till quite\r\ncold; then mix all the ingredients together, and let them remain for 10\r\ndays, shaking them every day. Filter the mixture through blotting-paper,\r\nbottle off for use in small bottles, and seal the corks down. This will\r\nbe found useful for flavouring many sweet dishes.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make about 24 pints of Noyeau.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--May be made at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE BRANDY.\r\n\r\n(_Excellent_.)\r\n\r\n1826. INGREDIENTS.--To every 1 gallon of brandy allow 3/4 pint of\r\nSeville orange-juice, 1-1/4 lb. of loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--To bring out the full flavour of the orange-peel, rub a few\r\nlumps of the sugar on 2 or 3 unpared oranges, and put these lumps to the\r\nrest. Mix the brandy with the orange-juice, strained, the rinds of 6 of\r\nthe oranges pared very thin, and the sugar. Let all stand in a\r\nclosely-covered jar for about 3 days, stirring it 3 or 4 times a day.\r\nWhen clear, it should be bottled and closely corked for a year; it will\r\nthen be ready for use, but will keep any length of time. This is a most\r\nexcellent stomachic when taken pure in small quantities; or, as the\r\nstrength of the brandy is very little deteriorated by the other\r\ningredients, it may be diluted with water.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To be stirred every day for 3 days.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 7s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 2 quarts. _Seasonable_.--Make this in March.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VERY SIMPLE AND EASY METHOD OF MAKING A VERY SUPERIOR ORANGE WINE.\r\n\r\n1827. INGREDIENTS.--90 Seville oranges, 32 lbs. of lump sugar, water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Break up the sugar into small pieces, and put it into a dry,\r\nsweet 9-gallon cask, placed in a cellar or other storehouse, where it is\r\nintended to be kept. Have ready close to the cask two large pans or\r\nwooden keelers, into one of which put the peel of the oranges pared\r\nquite thin, and into the other the pulp after the juice has been\r\nsqueezed from it. Strain the juice through a piece of double muslin, and\r\nput it into the cask with the sugar. Then pour about 1-1/2 gallon of\r\ncold spring water on both the peels and pulp; let it stand for 24 hours,\r\nand then strain it into the cask; add more water to the peels and pulp\r\nwhen this is done, and repeat the same process every day for a week: it\r\nshould take about a week to fill up the cask. Be careful to apportion\r\nthe quantity as nearly as possible to the seven days, and to stir the\r\ncontents of the cask each day. On the ''third' day after the cask is\r\nfull,--that is, the 'tenth' day after the commencement of making,--the\r\ncask may be securely bunged down. This is a very simple and easy method,\r\nand the wine made according to it will be pronounced to be most\r\nexcellent. There is no troublesome boiling, and all fermentation takes\r\nplace in the cask. When the above directions are attended to, the wine\r\ncannot fail to be good. It should be bottled in 8 or 9 months, and will\r\nbe fit for use in a twelve month after the time of making. Ginger wine\r\nmay be made in precisely the same manner, only, with the 9-gallon cask\r\nfor ginger wine, 2 lbs. of the best whole ginger, 'bruised', must be put\r\nwith the sugar. It will be found convenient to tie the ginger loosely in\r\na muslin bag.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether, 10 days to make it.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 2s. 6d. per gallon. _Sufficient_ for 9 gallons.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in March, and bottle it the following January.\r\n\r\n\r\nRASPBERRY VINEGAR.\r\n\r\n1828. INGREDIENTS.--To every 3 pints of the best vinegar allow 4-1/2\r\npints of freshly-gathered raspberries; to each pint of liquor allow 1\r\nlb. of pounded loaf sugar, 1 wineglassful of brandy.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the raspberries be freshly gathered; pick them from the\r\nstalks, and put 1-1/2 pint of them into a stone jar; pour 3 pints of the\r\nbest vinegar over them, and let them remain for 24 hours; then strain\r\nthe liquor over another 1-1/2 pint of fresh raspberries. Let them remain\r\nanother 24 hours, and the following day repeat the process for the third\r\ntime; then drain off the liquor without pressing, and pass it through a\r\njelly-bag (previously wetted with plain vinegar), into a stone jar. Add\r\nto every pint of the liquor 1 lb. of pounded loaf sugar; stir them\r\ntogether, and, when the sugar is dissolved, cover the jar; set it upon\r\nthe fire in a saucepan of boiling water, and let it boil for an hour,\r\nremoving the scum as fast as it rises; add to each pint a glass of\r\nbrandy, bottle it, and seal the corks. This is an excellent drink in\r\ncases of fevers and colds: it should be diluted with cold water,\r\naccording to the taste or requirement of the patient.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To be boiled 1 hour. Average cost, 1s. per pint.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 2 quarts.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in July or August, when raspberries are most\r\nplentiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHUBARB WINE.\r\n\r\n1829. INGREDIENTS.--To every 5 lbs. of rhubarb pulp allow 1 gallon of\r\ncold spring water; to every gallon of liquor allow 3 lbs. of loaf sugar,\r\n1/2 oz. of isinglass, the rind of 1 lemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Gather the rhubarb about the middle of May; wipe it with a wet\r\ncloth, and, with a mallet, bruise it in a large wooden tub or other\r\nconvenient means. When reduced to a pulp, weigh it, and to every 5 lbs.\r\nadd 1 gallon of cold spring water; let these remain for 3 days, stirring\r\n3 or 4 times a day; and, on the fourth day, press the pulp through a\r\nhair sieve; put the liquor into a tub, and to every gallon put 3 lbs. of\r\nloaf sugar; stir in the sugar until it is quite dissolved, and add the\r\nlemon-rind; let the liquor remain, and, in 4, 5, or 6 days, the\r\nfermentation will begin to subside, and a crust or head will be formed,\r\nwhich should be skimmed off, or the liquor drawn from it, when the crust\r\nbegins to crack or separate. Put the wine into a cask, and if, after\r\nthat, it ferments, rack it off into another cask, and in a fortnight\r\nstop it down. If the wine should have lost any of its original\r\nsweetness, add a little more loaf sugar, taking care that the cask is\r\nfull. Bottle it off in February or March, and in the summer it should be\r\nfit to drink. It will improve greatly by keeping; and, should a very\r\nbrilliant colour be desired, add a little currant-juice.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this about the middle of May.\r\n\r\n\r\nWELSH NECTAR.\r\n\r\n1830. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of raisins, 3 lemons, 2 lbs. of loaf sugar, 2\r\ngallons of boiling water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the peel of the lemons very thin, pour upon it the boiling\r\nwater, and, when cool, add the strained juice of the lemons, the sugar,\r\nand the raisins, stoned and chopped very fine. Let it stand 4 or 5 days,\r\nstirring it every day; then strain it through a jelly-bag, and bottle it\r\nfor present use.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--4 or 5 days. _Average cost_, 1s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 2 gallons.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLARET-CUP.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLARET CUP.]\r\n\r\n1831. INGREDIENTS.--1 bottle of claret, 1 bottle of soda-water, about\r\n1/2 lb. of pounded ice, 4 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, 1/4\r\nteaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1 liqueur-glass of Maraschino, a sprig of\r\ngreen borage.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a silver cup, regulating the\r\nproportion of ice by the state of the weather: if very warm, a larger\r\nquantity would be necessary. Hand the cup round with a clean napkin\r\npassed through one of the handles, that the edge of the cup may be wiped\r\nafter each guest has partaken of the contents thereof.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ in summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CLARETS.--All those wines called in England clarets are the\r\n    produce of the country round Bordeaux, or the Bordelais; but it\r\n    is remarkable that there is no pure wine in France known by the\r\n    name of claret, which is a corruption of _clairet_, a term that\r\n    is applied there to any red or rose-coloured wine. Round\r\n    Bordeaux are produced a number of wines of the first quality,\r\n    which pass under the name simply of _vins de Bordeaux_, or have\r\n    the designation of the particular district where they are made;\r\n    as Lafitte, Latour, &c. The clarets brought to the English\r\n    market are frequently prepared for it by the wine-growers by\r\n    mixing together several Bordeaux wines, or by adding to them a\r\n    portion of some other wines; but in France the pure wines are\r\n    carefully preserved distinct. The genuine wines of Bordeaux are\r\n    of great variety, that part being one of the most distinguished\r\n    in France; and the principal vineyards are those of Medoc,\r\n    Palus, Graves, and Blanche, the product of each having\r\n    characters considerably different.\r\n\r\nCHAMPAGNE-CUP.\r\n\r\n1832. INGREDIENTS.--1 quart bottle of champagne, 2 bottles of\r\nsoda-water, 1 liqueur-glass of brandy or Curaçoa, 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\npowdered sugar, 1 lb. of pounded ice, a sprig of green borage.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put all the ingredients into a silver cup; stir them together,\r\nand serve the same as claret-cup No. 1831. Should the above proportion\r\nof sugar not be found sufficient to suit some tastes, increase the\r\nquantity. When borage is not easily obtainable, substitute for it a few\r\nslices of cucumber-rind.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Suitable for pic-nics, balls, weddings, and other festive\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n    CHAMPAGNE.--This, the most celebrated of French wines, is the\r\n    produce chiefly of the province of that name, and is generally\r\n    understood in England to be a brisk, effervescing, or sparkling\r\n    white wine, of a very fine flavour; but this is only one of the\r\n    varieties of this class. There is both red and white champagne,\r\n    and each of these may be either still or brisk. There are the\r\n    sparkling wines (mousseux), and the still wines (non-mousseux).\r\n    The brisk are in general the most highly esteemed, or, at least,\r\n    are the most popular in this country, on account of their\r\n    delicate flavour and the agreeable pungency which they derive\r\n    from the carbonic acid they contain, and to which they owe their\r\n    briskness.\r\n\r\nGINGER BEER.\r\n\r\n1833. INGREDIENTS.--2-1/2 lbs. of loaf sugar, 1-1/2 oz. of bruised\r\nginger, 1 oz. of cream of tartar, the rind and juice of 2 lemons, 3\r\ngallons of boiling water, 2 large tablespoonfuls of thick and fresh\r\nbrewer's yeast.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Peel the lemons, squeeze the juice, strain it, and put the peel\r\nand juice into a large earthen pan, with the bruised ginger, cream of\r\ntartar, and loaf sugar. Pour over these ingredients 3 gallons of boiling\r\nwater; let it stand until just warm, when add the yeast, which should be\r\nthick and perfectly fresh. Stir the contents of the pan well, and let\r\nthem remain near the fire all night, covering the pan over with a cloth.\r\nThe next day skim off the yeast, and pour the liquor carefully into\r\nanother vessel, leaving the sediment; then bottle immediately, and tie\r\nthe corks down, and in 3 days the ginger beer will be fit for use. For\r\nsome tastes, the above proportion of sugar may be found rather too\r\nlarge, when it may be diminished; but the beer will not keep so long\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_ for this quantity, 2s.; or 1/2d. per bottle.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to fill 4 dozen ginger-beer bottles.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--This should be made during the summer months.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMONADE.\r\n\r\n1834. INGREDIENTS--The rind of 2 lemons, the juice of 3 large or 4 small\r\nones, 1 lb. of loaf sugar, 1 quart of boiling water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub some of the sugar, in lumps, on 2 of the lemons until they\r\nhave imbibed all the oil from them, and put it with the remainder of the\r\nsugar into a jug; add the lemon-juice (but no pips), and pour over the\r\nwhole a quart of boiling water. When the sugar is dissolved, strain the\r\nlemonade through a fine sieve or piece of muslin, and, when cool, it\r\nwill be ready for use. The lemonade will be much improved by having the\r\nwhite of an egg beaten up in it; a little sherry mixed with it, also,\r\nmakes this beverage much nicer.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d. per quart.\r\n\r\n    LEMONADE--\"There is a current opinion among women\" says Brillat\r\n    Savarin \"which every year causes the death of many young\r\n    women,--that acids, especially vinegar, are preventives of\r\n    obesity. Beyond all doubt, acids have the effect of destroying\r\n    obesity; but they also destroy health and freshness. Lemonade\r\n    is, of all acids, the most harmless; but few stomachs can resist\r\n    it long. I knew, in 1776, at Dijon, a young lady of great\r\n    beauty, to whom I was attached by bonds of friendship, great,\r\n    almost as those of love. One day, when she had for some time\r\n    gradually grown pale and thin (previously she had a slight\r\n    embonpoint), she told me in confidence, that as her young\r\n    friends had ridiculed her for being fat, she had, to counteract\r\n    the tendency, been in the habit every day of drinking a large\r\n    glass of vinaigre. She died at eighteen years of age, from the\r\n    effects of these potions.\"\r\n\r\nTO MAKE NEGUS.\r\n\r\n1835. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of port wine allow 1 quart of boiling\r\nwater, 1/4 lb. of sugar, 1 lemon, grated nutmeg to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--As this beverage is more usually drunk at children's parties\r\nthan at any other, the wine need not be very old or expensive for the\r\npurpose, a new fruity wine answering very well for it. Put the wine into\r\na jug, rub some lumps of sugar (equal to 1/4 lb.) on the lemon-rind\r\nuntil all the yellow part of the skin is absorbed, then squeeze the\r\njuice, and strain it. Add the sugar and lemon-juice to the port wine,\r\nwith the grated nutmeg; pour over it the boiling water, cover the jug,\r\nand, when the beverage has cooled a little, it will be fit for use.\r\nNegus may also be made of sherry, or any other sweet white wine, but is\r\nmore usually made of port than of any other beverage.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_--Allow 1 pint of wine, with the other ingredients in\r\nproportion, for a party of 9 or 10 children.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLEASANT DRINK FOR WARM WEATHER.\r\n\r\n1836. INGREDIENTS.--To every 1-1/2 pint of good ale allow 1 bottle of\r\nginger beer. _Mode_.--For this beverage the ginger beer must be in an\r\neffervescing state, and the beer not in the least turned or sour. Mix\r\nthem together, and drink immediately. The draught is refreshing and\r\nwholesome, as the ginger corrects the action of the beer. It does not\r\ndeteriorate by standing a little, but, of course, is better when taken\r\nfresh.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR A SUMMER DRAUGHT.\r\n\r\n1837. INGREDIENTS.--The juice of 1 lemon, a tumbler-ful of cold water,\r\npounded sugar to taste, 4 small teaspoonful of carbonate of soda.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Squeeze the juice from the lemon; strain, and add it to the\r\nwater, with sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten the whole nicely. When\r\nwell mixed, put in the soda, stir well, and drink while the mixture is\r\nin an effervescing state.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MULL WINE.\r\n\r\n1838. INGREDIENTS.--To every pint of wine allow 1 large cupful of water,\r\nsugar and spice to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--In making preparations like the above, it is very difficult to\r\ngive the exact proportions of ingredients like sugar and spice, as what\r\nquantity might suit one person would be to another quite distasteful.\r\nBoil the spice in the water until the flavour is extracted, then add the\r\nwine and sugar, and bring the whole to the boiling-point, when serve\r\nwith strips of crisp dry toast, or with biscuits. The spices usually\r\nused for mulled wine are cloves, grated nutmeg, and cinnamon or mace.\r\nAny kind of wine may be mulled, but port and claret are those usually\r\nselected for the purpose; and the latter requires a very large\r\nproportion of sugar. The vessel that the wine is boiled in must be\r\ndelicately clean, and should be kept exclusively for the purpose. Small\r\ntin warmers may be purchased for a trifle, which are more suitable than\r\nsaucepans, as, if the latter are not scrupulously clean, they will spoil\r\nthe wine, by imparting to it a very disagreeable flavour. These warmers\r\nshould be used for no other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE HOT PUNCH.\r\n\r\n1839. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of rum, 1/2 pint of brandy, 1/4 lb. of\r\nsugar, 1 large lemon, 1/2 teaspoonful of nutmeg, 1 pint of boiling\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUNCH-BOWL AND LADLE.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Rub the sugar over the lemon until it has absorbed all the\r\nyellow part of the skin, then put the sugar into a punchbowl; add the\r\nlemon-juice (free from pips), and mix these two ingredients well\r\ntogether. Pour over them the boiling water, stir well together, add the\r\nrum, brandy, and nutmeg; mix thoroughly, and the punch will be ready to\r\nserve. It is very important in making good punch that all the\r\ningredients are thoroughly incorporated; and, to insure success, the\r\nprocesses of mixing must be diligently attended to.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow a quart for 4 persons; but this information must be\r\ntaken _cum grano salis_; for the capacities of persons for this kind of\r\nbeverage are generally supposed to vary considerably.\r\n\r\n    PUNCH is a beverage made of various spirituous liquors or wine,\r\n    hot water, the acid juice of fruits, and sugar. It is considered\r\n    to be very intoxicating; but this is probably because the\r\n    spirit, being partly sheathed by the mucilaginous juice and the\r\n    sugar, its strength does not appear to the taste so great as it\r\n    really is. Punch, which was almost universally drunk among the\r\n    middle classes about fifty or sixty years ago, has almost\r\n    disappeared from our domestic tables, being superseded by wine.\r\n    There are many different varieties of punch. It is sometimes\r\n    kept cold in bottles, and makes a most agreeable summer drink.\r\n    In Scotland, instead of the Madeira or sherry generally used in\r\n    its manufacture, whiskey is substituted, and then its insidious\r\n    properties are more than usually felt. Where fresh lemons cannot\r\n    be had for punch or similar beverages, crystallized citric acid\r\n    and a few drops of the essence of lemon will be very nearly the\r\n    same thing. In the composition of \"Regent's punch,\" champagne,\r\n    brandy, and _veritable Martinique_ are required; \"Norfolk punch\"\r\n    requires Seville oranges; \"Milk punch\" may be extemporized by\r\n    adding a little hot milk to lemonade, and then straining it\r\n    through a jelly-bag. Then there are \"Wine punch,\" \"Tea punch,\"\r\n    and \"French punch,\" made with lemons, spirits, and wine, in\r\n    fantastic proportions. But of all the compounds of these\r\n    materials, perhaps, for a _summer_ drink, the North-American\r\n    \"mint julep\" is the most inviting. Captain Marryat gives the\r\n    following recipe for its preparation:--\"Put into a tumbler about\r\n    a dozen sprigs of the tender shoots of mint; upon them put a\r\n    spoonful of white sugar, and equal proportions of peach and\r\n    common brandy, so as to fill up one third, or, perhaps, a little\r\n    less; then take rasped or pounded ice, and fill up the tumbler.\r\n    Epicures rub the lips of the tumbler with a piece of fresh\r\n    pineapple; and the tumbler itself is very often encrusted\r\n    outside with stalactites of ice. As the ice melts, you drink.\"\r\n    The Virginians, say Captain Marryat, claim the merit of having\r\n    invented this superb compound; but, from a passage in the\r\n    \"Comus\" of Milton, he claims it for his own country.\r\n\r\nWHISKEY CORDIAL.\r\n\r\n1840. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of ripe white currants, the rind of 2 lemons,\r\n1/4 oz. of grated ginger, 1 quart of whiskey, 1 lb. of lump sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Strip the currants from the stalks; put them into a large jug;\r\nadd the lemon-rind, ginger, and whiskey; cover the jug closely, and let\r\nit remain covered for 24 hours. Strain through a hair sieve, add the\r\nlump sugar, and let it stand 12 hours longer; then bottle, and cork\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To stand 24 hours before being strained; 12 hours after the\r\nsugar is added.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_.--Make this in July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINVALID COOKERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW RULES TO BE OBSERVED IN COOKING FOR INVALIDS.\r\n\r\n1841. LET all the kitchen utensils used in the preparation of invalids'\r\ncookery be delicately and 'scrupulously clean;' if this is not the case,\r\na disagreeable flavour may be imparted to the preparation, which flavour\r\nmay disgust, and prevent the patient from partaking of the refreshment\r\nwhen brought to him or her.\r\n\r\n1842. For invalids, never make a large quantity of one thing, as they\r\nseldom require much at a time; and it is desirable that variety be\r\nprovided for them.\r\n\r\n1843. Always have something in readiness; a little beef tea, nicely made\r\nand nicely skimmed, a few spoonfuls of jelly, &c. &c., that it may be\r\nadministered as soon almost as the invalid wishes for it. If obliged to\r\nwait a long time, the patient loses the desire to eat, and often turns\r\nagainst the food when brought to him or her.\r\n\r\n1844. In sending dishes or preparations up to invalids, let everything\r\nlook as tempting as possible. Have a clean tray-cloth laid smoothly over\r\nthe tray; let the spoons, tumblers, cups and saucers, &c., be very clean\r\nand bright. Gruel served in a tumbler is more appetizing than when\r\nserved in a basin or cup and saucer.\r\n\r\n1845. As milk is an important article of food for the sick, in warm\r\nweather let it be kept on ice, to prevent its turning sour. Many other\r\ndelicacies may also be preserved good in the same manner for some little\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n1846. If the patient be allowed to eat vegetables, never send them up\r\nundercooked, or half raw; and let a small quantity only be temptingly\r\narranged on a dish. This rule will apply to every preparation, as an\r\ninvalid is much more likely to enjoy his food if small delicate pieces\r\nare served to him.\r\n\r\n1847. Never leave food about a sick room; if the patient cannot eat it\r\nwhen brought to him, take it away, and bring it to him in an hour or\r\ntwo's time. Miss Nightingale says, \"To leave the patient's untasted food\r\nby his side, from meal to meal, in hopes that he will eat it in the\r\ninterval, is simply to prevent him from taking any food at all.\" She\r\nsays, \"I have known patients literally incapacitated from taking one\r\narticle of food after another by this piece of ignorance. Let the food\r\ncome at the right time, and be taken away, eaten or uneaten, at the\r\nright time, but never let a patient have 'something always standing' by\r\nhim, if you don't wish to disgust him of everything.\"\r\n\r\n1848. Never serve beef tea or broth with the _smallest particle_ of fat\r\nor grease on the surface. It is better, after making either of these, to\r\nallow them to get perfectly cold, when _all the fat_ may be easily\r\nremoved; then warm up as much as may be required. Two or three pieces of\r\nclean whity-brown paper laid on the broth will absorb any greasy\r\nparticles that may be floating at the top, as the grease will cling to\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\n1849. Roast mutton, chickens, rabbits, calves' feet or head, game, fish\r\n(simply dressed), and simple puddings, are all light food, and easily\r\ndigested. Of course, these things are only partaken of, supposing the\r\npatient is recovering.\r\n\r\n1850. A mutton chop, nicely cut, trimmed, and broiled to a turn, is a\r\ndish to be recommended for invalids; but it must not be served _with all\r\nthe fat_ at the end, nor must it be too thickly cut. Let it be cooked\r\nover a fire free from smoke, and sent up with the gravy in it, between\r\ntwo very hot plates. Nothing is more disagreeable to an invalid than\r\n_smoked_ food.\r\n\r\n1851. In making toast-and-water, never blacken the bread, but toast it\r\nonly a nice brown. Never leave toast-and-water to make until the moment\r\nit is required, as it cannot then be properly prepared,--at least, the\r\npatient will be obliged to drink it warm, which is anything but\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\n1852. In boiling eggs for invalids, let the white be just set; if boiled\r\nhard, they will be likely to disagree with the patient.\r\n\r\n1853. In Miss Nightingale's admirable \"Notes on Nursing,\" a book that no\r\nmother or nurse should be without, she says,--\"You cannot be too careful\r\nas to quality in sick diet. A nurse should never put before a patient\r\nmilk that is sour, meat or soup that is turned, an egg that is bad, or\r\nvegetables underdone.\" Yet often, she says, she has seen these things\r\nbrought in to the sick, in a state perfectly perceptible to every nose\r\nor eye except the nurse's. It is here that the clever nurse\r\nappears,--she will not bring in the peccant article; but, not to\r\ndisappoint the patient, she will whip up something else in a few\r\nminutes. Remember, that sick cookery should half do the work of your\r\npoor patient's weak digestion.\r\n\r\n1854. She goes on to caution nurses, by saying,--\"Take care not to spill\r\ninto your patient's saucer; in other words, take care that the outside\r\nbottom rim of his cup shall be quite dry and clean. If, every time he\r\nlifts his cup to his lips, he has to carry the saucer with it, or else\r\nto drop the liquid upon and to soil his sheet, or bedgown, or pillow,\r\nor, if he is sitting up, his dress, you have no idea what a difference\r\nthis minute want of care on your part makes to his comfort, and even to\r\nhis willingness for food.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE ARROWROOT.\r\n\r\n1855. INGREDIENTS.--Two teaspoonfuls of arrowroot, 3 tablespoonfuls of\r\ncold water, 1/2 pint of boiling water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the arrowroot smoothly in a basin with the cold water, then\r\npour on it the _boiling_ water, _stirring_ all the time. The water must\r\nbe _boiling_ at the time it is poured on the mixture, or it will not\r\nthicken; if mixed with hot water only, it must be put into a clean\r\nsaucepan, and boiled until it thickens; but this is more trouble, and\r\nquite unnecessary if the water is boiling at first. Put the arrowroot\r\ninto a tumbler, sweeten it with lump sugar, and flavour it with grated\r\nnutmeg or cinnamon, or a piece of lemon-peel, or, when allowed, 3\r\ntablespoonfuls of port or sherry. As arrowroot is in itself flavourless\r\nand insipid, it is almost necessary to add the wine to make it\r\npalatable. Arrowroot made with milk instead of water is far nicer, but\r\nis not so easily digested. It should be mixed in the same manner, with 3\r\ntablespoonfuls of cold water, the boiling milk then poured on it, and\r\nwell stirred. When made in this manner, no wine should be added, but\r\nmerely sugar, and a little grated nutmeg or lemon-peel.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--If obliged to be boiled, 2 minutes. _Average cost_, 2d. per\r\npint.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 1/2 pint of arrowroot.\r\n\r\n    MISS NIGHTINGALE says, in her \"Notes on Nursing,\" that arrowroot\r\n    is a grand dependence of the nurse. As a vehicle for wine, and\r\n    as a restorative quickly prepared, it is all very well, but it\r\n    is nothing but starch and water; flour is both more nutritive\r\n    and less liable to ferment, and is preferable wherever it can be\r\n    used.\r\n\r\nBARLEY GRUEL.\r\n\r\n1856. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of Scotch or pearl barley, 1/2 pint of port\r\nwine, the rind of 1 lemon, 1 quart and 1/2 pint of water, sugar to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--After well washing the barley, boil it in 1/2 pint of water for\r\n1/4 hour; then pour this water away; put to the barley the quart of\r\nfresh boiling water, and let it boil until the liquid is reduced to\r\nhalf; then strain it off. Add the wine, sugar, and lemon-peel; simmer\r\nfor 5 minutes, and put it away in a clean jug. It can be warmed from\r\ntime to time, as required.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To be boiled until reduced to half. _Average cost_, 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ with the wine to make 1-1/2 pint of gruel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE BARLEY-WATER.\r\n\r\n1857. INGREDIENTS.--2 oz. of pearl barley, 2 quarts of boiling water, 1\r\npint of cold water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the barley in cold water; put it into a saucepan with the\r\nabove proportion of cold water, and when it has boiled for about 1/4\r\nhour, strain off the water, and add the 2 quarts of fresh boiling water.\r\nBoil it until the liquid is reduced one half; strain it, and it will be\r\nready for use. It may be flavoured with lemon-peel, after being\r\nsweetened, or a small piece may be simmered with the barley. When the\r\ninvalid may take it, a little lemon-juice gives this pleasant drink in\r\nillness a very nice flavour.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To boil until the liquid is reduced one half.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 1 quart of barley-water.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE BEEF TEA.\r\n\r\n1858. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of lean gravy-beef, 1 quart of water, 1\r\nsaltspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the meat cut without fat and bone, and choose a nice\r\nfleshy piece. Cut it into small pieces about the size of dice, and put\r\nit into a clean saucepan. Add the water _cold_ to it; put it on the\r\nfire, and bring it to the boiling-point; then skim well. Put in the salt\r\nwhen the water boils, and _simmer_ the beef tea _gently_ from 1/2 to 3/4\r\nhour, removing any more scum should it appear on the surface. Strain the\r\ntea through a hair sieve, and set it by in a cool place. When wanted for\r\nuse, remove every particle of fat from the top; warm up as much as may\r\nbe required, adding, if necessary, a little more salt. This preparation\r\nis simple beef tea, and is to be administered to those invalids to whom\r\nflavourings and seasonings are not allowed. When the patient is very\r\nlow, use double the quantity of meat to the same proportion of water.\r\nShould the invalid be able to take the tea prepared in a more palatable\r\nmanner, it is easy to make it so by following the directions in the next\r\nrecipe, which is an admirable one for making savoury beef tea. Beef tea\r\nis always better when made the day before it is wanted, and then warmed\r\nup. It is a good plan to put the tea into a small cup or basin, and to\r\nplace this basin in a saucepan of boiling water. When the tea is warm,\r\nit is ready to serve.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/4 to 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 6d. per pint.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 lb. of meat for a pint of good beef tea.\r\n\r\n    MISS NIGHTINGALE says, one of the most common errors among\r\n    nurses, with respect to sick diet, is the belief that beef tea\r\n    is the most nutritive of all article. She says, \"Just try and\r\n    boil down a lb. of beef into beef tea; evaporate your beef tea,\r\n    and see what is left of your beef: you will find that there is\r\n    barely a teaspoonful of solid nourishment to 1/4 pint of water\r\n    in beef tea. Nevertheless, there is a certain reparative quality\r\n    in it,--we do not know what,--as there is in tea; but it maybe\r\n    safely given in almost any inflammatory disease, and is as\r\n    little to be depended upon with the healthy or convalescent,\r\n    where much nourishment is required.\"\r\n\r\nSAVOURY BEEF TEA.\r\n\r\n(_Soyer's Recipe_.)\r\n\r\n1859. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of solid beef, 1 oz. of butter, 1 clove, 2\r\nbutton onions or 1/2 a large one, 1 saltspoonful of salt, 1 quart of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the beef into very small dice; put it into a stewpan with\r\nthe butter, clove, onion, and salt; stir the meat round over the fire\r\nfor a few minutes, until it produces a thin gravy; then add the water,\r\nand let it simmer gently from 1/2 to 3/4 hour, skimming off every\r\nparticle of fat. When done, strain it through a sieve, and put it by in\r\na cool place until required. The same, if wanted quite plain, is done by\r\nmerely omitting the vegetables, salt, and clove; the butter cannot be\r\nobjectionable, as it is taken out in skimming.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 to 3/4 hour. _Average cost_, 8d. per pint.\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 lb. of beef to make 1 pint of good beef tea.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--The meat loft from beef tea may be boiled a little longer, and\r\npounded, with spices, &c., for potting. It makes a very nice breakfast\r\ndish.\r\n\r\n    DR. CHRISTISON says that \"every one will be struck with the\r\n    readiness with which certain classes of patients will often take\r\n    diluted meat juice, or beef tea repeatedly, when they refuse all\r\n    other kinds of food.\" This is particularly remarkable in case of\r\n    gastric fever, in which, he says, little or nothing else besides\r\n    beef tea, or diluted meat juice, has been taken for weeks, or\r\n    even months; and yet a pint of beef tea contains scarcely 1/4\r\n    oz. of anything but water. The result is so striking, that he\r\n    asks, \"What is its mode of action? Not simple nutriment; 1/4 oz.\r\n    of the most nutritive material cannot nearly replace the daily\r\n    wear and tear of the tissue in any circumstances.\" Possibly, he\r\n    says, it belongs to a new denomination of remedies.\r\n\r\nBAKED BEEF TEA.\r\n\r\n1860. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of fleshy beef, 1-1/2 pint of water, 1/4\r\nsaltspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the beef into small square pieces, after trimming off all\r\nthe fat, and put it into a baking-jar, with the above proportion of\r\nwater and salt; cover the jar well, place it in a warm, but not hot\r\noven, and bake for 3 or 4 hours. When the oven is very fierce in the\r\ndaytime, it is a good plan to put the jar in at night, and let it remain\r\ntill the next morning, when the tea will be done. It should be strained,\r\nand put by in a cool place until wanted. It may also be flavoured with\r\nan onion, a clove, and a few sweet herbs, &c., when the stomach is\r\nsufficiently strong to take those.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 or 4 hours, or to be left in the oven all night.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d. per pint.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_.--Allow 1 lb. of meat for 1 pint of good beef tea.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED OR STEWED CALF'S FOOT.\r\n\r\n1861. INGREDIENTS.--1 calf's foot, 1 pint of milk, 1 pint of water, 1\r\nblade of mace, the rind of 1/4 lemon, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Well clean the foot, and either stew or bake it in the\r\nmilk-and-water with the other ingredients from 3 to 4 hours. To enhance\r\nthe flavour, an onion and a small quantity of celery may be added, if\r\napproved; 1/2 a teacupful of cream, stirred in just before serving, is\r\nalso a great improvement to this dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--3 to 4 hours. _Average cost_, in full season, 9d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 person. _Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALF'S-FOOT BROTH.\r\n\r\n1862. INGREDIENTS.--1 calf's foot, 3 pints of water, 1 small lump of\r\nsugar, nutmeg to taste, the yolk of 1 egg, a piece of butter the size of\r\na nut.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Stew the foot in the water, with the lemon-peel, very gently,\r\nuntil the liquid is half wasted, removing any scum, should it rise to\r\nthe surface. Set it by in a basin until quite cold, then take off every\r\nparticle of fat. Warm up about 1/2 pint of the broth, adding the butter,\r\nsugar, and a very small quantity of grated nutmeg; take it off the fire\r\nfor a minute or two, then add the beaten yolk of the egg; keep stirring\r\nover the fire until the mixture thickens, but do not allow it to boil\r\nagain after the egg is added, or it will curdle, and the broth will be\r\nspoiled.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To be boiled until the liquid is reduced one half.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, in full season, 9d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 1-1/4 pint of broth.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from March to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICKEN BROTH.\r\n\r\n1863. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 fowl, or the inferior joints of a whole one; 1\r\nquart of water, 1 blade of mace, 1/2 onion, a small bunch of sweet\r\nherbs, salt to taste, 10 peppercorns.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--An old fowl not suitable for eating may be converted into very\r\ngood broth, or, if a young one be used, the inferior joints may be put\r\nin the broth, and the best pieces reserved for dressing in some other\r\nmanner. Put the fowl into a saucepan, with all the ingredients, and\r\nsimmer gently for 1-1/2 hour, carefully skimming the broth well. When\r\ndone, strain, and put by in a cool place until wanted; then take all the\r\nfat off the top, warm up as much as may be required, and serve. This\r\nbroth is, of course, only for those invalids whose stomachs are strong\r\nenough to digest it, with a flavouring of herbs, &c. It may be made in\r\nthe same manner as beef tea, with water and salt only; but the\r\npreparation will be but tasteless and insipid. When the invalid cannot\r\ndigest this chicken broth with the flavouring, we would recommend plain\r\nbeef tea in preference to plain chicken tea, which it would be without\r\nthe addition of herbs, onions, &c.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1-1/2 hour.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make rather more than 1 pint of broth.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUTRITIOUS COFFEE.\r\n\r\n1864. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 oz. of ground coffee, 1 pint of milk.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the coffee be freshly ground; put it into a saucepan, with\r\nthe milk, which should be made nearly boiling before the coffee is put\r\nin, and boil both together for 3 minutes; clear it by pouring some of it\r\ninto a cup, and then back again, and leave it on the hob for a few\r\nminutes to settle thoroughly. This coffee may be made still more\r\nnutritious by the addition of an egg well beaten, and put into the\r\ncoffee-cup.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 minutes to boil, 5 minutes to settle.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 1 large breakfast-cupful of coffee.\r\n\r\n    Our great nurse Miss Nightingale remarks, that \"a great deal too\r\n    much against tea is said by wise people, and a great deal too\r\n    much of tea is given to the sick by foolish people. When you see\r\n    the natural and almost universal craving in English sick for\r\n    their 'tea,' you cannot but feel that Nature knows what she is\r\n    about. But a little tea or coffee restores them quite as much as\r\n    a great deal; and a great deal of tea, and especially of coffee,\r\n    impairs the little power of digestion they have. Yet a nurse,\r\n    because she sees how one or two cups of tea or coffee restore\r\n    her patient, thinks that three or four cups will do twice as\r\n    much. This is not the case at all; it is, however, certain that\r\n    there is nothing yet discovered which is a substitute to the\r\n    English patient for his cup of tea; he can take it when he can\r\n    take nothing else, and he often can't take anything else, if he\r\n    has it not. Coffee is a better restorative than tea, but a\r\n    greater impairer of the digestion. In making coffee, it is\r\n    absolutely necessary to buy it in the berry, and grind it at\r\n    home; otherwise, you may reckon upon its containing a certain\r\n    amount of chicory, at least. This is not a question of the\r\n    taste, or of the wholesomeness of chicory; it is, that chicory\r\n    has nothing at all of the properties for which you give coffee,\r\n    and, therefore, you may as well not give it.\"\r\n\r\nTHE INVALID'S CUTLET.\r\n\r\n1865. INGREDIENTS.--1 nice cutlet from a loin or neck of mutton, 2\r\nteacupfuls of water, 1 very small stick of celery, pepper and salt to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Have the cutlet cut from a very nice loin or neck of mutton;\r\ntake off all the fat; put it into a stewpan, with the other ingredients;\r\nstew _very gently_ indeed for nearly 2 hours, and skim off every\r\nparticle of fat that may rise to the surface from time to time. The\r\ncelery should be cut into thin slices before it is added to the meat,\r\nand care must be taken not to put in too much of this ingredient, or the\r\ndish will not be good. If the water is allowed to boil fast, the cutlet\r\nwill be hard.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours' very gentle stewing. _Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 person. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nEEL BROTH.\r\n\r\n1866. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. of eels, a small bunch of sweet herbs,\r\nincluding parsley; 1/2 onion, 10 peppercorns, 3 pints of water, 2\r\ncloves, salt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--After having cleaned and skinned the eel, cut it into small\r\npieces, and put it into a stewpan, with the other ingredients; simmer\r\ngently until the liquid is reduced nearly half, carefully removing the\r\nscum as it rises. Strain it through a hair sieve; put it by in a cool\r\nplace, and, when wanted, take off all the fat from the top, warm up as\r\nmuch as is required, and serve with sippets of toasted bread. This is a\r\nvery nutritious broth, and easy of digestion.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--To be simmered until the liquor is reduced to half.\r\n\r\n_Average cost_, 6d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 1-1/2 pint of broth.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ from June to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGG WINE.\r\n\r\n1867. INGREDIENTS.--1 egg, 1 tablespoonful and 1/2 glass of cold water,\r\n1 glass of sherry, sugar and grated nutmeg to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Beat the egg, mixing with it a tablespoonful of cold water;\r\nmake the wine-and-water hot, but not boiling; pour it on the egg,\r\nstirring all the time. Add sufficient lump sugar to sweeten the mixture,\r\nand a little grated nutmeg; put all into a very clean saucepan, set it\r\non a gentle fire, and stir the contents one way until they thicken, but\r\n_do not allow them to boil_. Serve in a glass with sippets of toasted\r\nbread or plain crisp biscuits. When the egg is not warmed, the mixture\r\nwill be found easier of digestion, but it is not so pleasant a drink.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 1 person.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE GRUEL.\r\n\r\n1868. INGREDIENTS.--1 tablespoonful of Robinson's patent groats, 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of cold water, 1 pint of boiling water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the prepared groats smoothly with the cold water in a\r\nbasin; pour over them the boiling water, stirring it all the time. Put\r\nit into a very clean saucepan; boil the gruel for 10 minutes, keeping it\r\nwell stirred; sweeten to taste, and serve. It may be flavoured with a\r\nsmall piece of lemon-peel, by boiling it in the gruel, or a little\r\ngrated nutmeg may be put in; but in these matters the taste of the\r\npatient should be consulted. Pour the gruel in a tumbler and serve. When\r\nwine is allowed to the invalid, 2 tablespoonfuls of sherry or port make\r\nthis preparation very nice. In cases of colds, the same quantity of\r\nspirits is sometimes added instead of wine.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--10 minutes.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make a pint of gruel.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVALID'S JELLY.\r\n\r\n1869. INGREDIENTS.--12 shanks of mutton, 3 quarts of water, a bunch of\r\nsweet herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 3 blades of mace, 1 onion, 1 lb.\r\nof lean beef, a crust of bread toasted brown.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Soak the shanks in plenty of water for some hours, and scrub\r\nthem well; put them, with the beef and other ingredients, into a\r\nsaucepan with the water, and let them simmer very gently for 5 hours.\r\nStrain the broth, and, when cold, take off all the fat. It may be eaten\r\neither warmed up or cold as a jelly.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--5 hours. _Average cost_, 1s.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make from 1-1/2 to 2 pints of jelly.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMONADE FOR INVALIDS.\r\n\r\n1870. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lemon, lump sugar to taste, 1 pint of boiling\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare off the rind of the lemon thinly; cut the lemon into 2 or\r\n3 thick slices, and remove as much as possible of the white outside\r\npith, and all the pips. Put the slices of lemon, the peel, and lump\r\nsugar into a jug; pour over the boiling water; cover it closely, and in\r\n2 hours it will be fit to drink. It should either be strained or poured\r\noff from the sediment.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--2 hours. _Average cost_, 2d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 1 pint of lemonade. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOURISHING LEMONADE.\r\n\r\n1871. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 pint of boiling water, the juice of 4 lemons,\r\nthe rinds of 2, 1/2 pint of sherry, 4 eggs, 6 oz. of loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pare off the lemon-rind thinly, put it into a jug with the\r\nsugar, and pour over the boiling water. Let it cool, then strain it; add\r\nthe wine, lemon-juice, and eggs, previously well beaten, and also\r\nstrained, and the beverage will be ready for use. If thought desirable,\r\nthe quantity of sherry and water could be lessened, and milk substituted\r\nfor them. To obtain the flavour of the lemon-rind properly, a few lumps\r\nof the sugar should be rubbed over it, until some of the yellow is\r\nabsorbed.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--Altogether 1 hour to make it. _Average cost_, 1s. 8d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 2-1/2 pints of lemonade. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE MUTTON BROTH.\r\n\r\n1872. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of the scrag end of the neck of mutton, 1\r\nonion, a bunch of sweet herbs, 4 turnip, 1/2 pints of water, pepper and\r\nsalt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the mutton into a stewpan; pour over the water cold and add\r\nthe other ingredients. When it boils, skim it very carefully, cover the\r\npan closely, and let it simmer very gently for an hour; strain it, let\r\nit cool, take off all the fat from the surface, and warm up as much as\r\nmay be required, adding, if the patient be allowed to take it, a\r\nteaspoonful of minced parsley which has been previously scalded. Pearl\r\nbarley or rice are very nice additions to mutton broth, and should be\r\nboiled as long as the other ingredients. When either of these is added,\r\nthe broth must not be strained, but merely thoroughly skimmed. Plain\r\nmutton broth without seasoning is made by merely boiling the mutton,\r\nwater, and salt together, straining it, letting the broth cool, skimming\r\nall the fat off, and warming up as much as is required. This preparation\r\nwould be very tasteless and insipid, but likely to agree with very\r\ndelicate stomachs, whereas the least addition of other ingredients would\r\nhave the contrary effect.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1 hour. _Average cost_, _7d._\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make from 1-1/2 to 2 pints of broth.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Veal broth may be made in the same manner; the knuckle of a leg\r\nor shoulder is the part usually used for this purpose. It is very good\r\nwith the addition of the inferior joints of a fowl, or a few\r\nshank-bones.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUTTON BROTH, QUICKLY MADE.\r\n\r\n1873. INGREDIENTS.--1 or 2 chops from a neck of mutton, 1 pint of water,\r\na small bunch of sweet herbs, 1/4 of an onion, pepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the meat into small pieces, put it into a saucepan with the\r\nbones, but no skin or fat; add the other ingredients; cover the\r\nsaucepan, and bring the water quickly to boil. Take the lid off, and\r\ncontinue the rapid boiling for 20 minutes, skimming it well during the\r\nprocess; strain the broth into a basin; if there should be any fat left\r\non the surface, remove it by laying a piece of thin paper on the top:\r\nthe greasy particles will adhere to the paper, and so free the\r\npreparation from them. To an invalid nothing is more disagreeable than\r\nbroth served with a quantity of fat floating on the top; to avoid this,\r\nit is always better to allow it to get thoroughly cool, the fat can then\r\nbe so easily removed.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--20 minutes after the water boils. _Average cost_, 5d.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ to make 1/2 pint of broth. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED RABBITS IN MILK.\r\n\r\n1874. INGREDIENTS.--2 very young rabbits, not nearly half grown; 1-1/2\r\npint of milk, 1 blade of mace, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, a little salt\r\nand cayenne.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the flour very smoothly with 4 tablespoonfuls of the milk,\r\nand when this is well mixed, add the remainder. Cut up the rabbits into\r\njoints, put them into a stewpan, with the milk and other ingredients,\r\nand simmer them _very gently_ until quite tender. Stir the contents from\r\ntime to time, to keep the milk smooth and prevent it from burning. 1/2\r\nhour will be sufficient for the cooking of this dish.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--1/2 hour. _Average cost_, from 1s. to 1s. 6d. each.\r\n\r\n_Sufficient_ for 3 or 4 meals. _Seasonable_ from September to February.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE-MILK.\r\n\r\n1875. INGREDIENTS.--3 tablespoonfuls of rice, 1 quart of milk, sugar to\r\ntaste; when liked, a little grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Well wash the rice, put it into a saucepan with the milk, and\r\nsimmer gently until the rice is tender, stirring it from time to time to\r\nprevent the milk from burning; sweeten it, add a little grated nutmeg,\r\nand serve. This dish is also very suitable and wholesome for children;\r\nit may be flavoured with a little lemon-peel, and a little finely-minced\r\nsuet may be boiled with it, which renders it more strengthening and more\r\nwholesome. Tapioca, semolina, vermicelli, and macaroni, may all be\r\ndressed in the same manner.\r\n\r\n_Time_.--From 3/4 to 1 hour. _Seasonable_ at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE TOAST-AND-WATER.\r\n\r\n1876. INGREDIENTS.--A slice of bread, 1 quart of boiling water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut a slice from a stale loaf (a piece of hard crust is better\r\nthan anything else for the purpose), toast it of a nice brown on every\r\nside, but _do not allow it to burn or blacken_. Put it into a jug, pour\r\nthe boiling water over it, cover it closely, and let it remain until\r\ncold. When strained, it will be ready for use. Toast-and-water should\r\nalways be made a short time before it is required, to enable it to get\r\ncold: if drunk in a tepid or lukewarm state, it is an exceedingly\r\ndisagreeable beverage. If, as is sometimes the case, this drink is\r\nwanted in a hurry, put the toasted bread into a jug, and only just cover\r\nit with the boiling water; when this is cool, cold water may be added in\r\nthe proportion required,--the toast-and-water strained; it will then be\r\nready for use, and is more expeditiously prepared than by the above\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAST SANDWICHES.\r\n\r\n1877. INGREDIENTS.--Thin cold toast, thin slices of bread-and-butter,\r\npepper and salt to taste.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Place a very thin piece of cold toast between 2 slices of thin\r\nbread-and-butter in the form of a sandwich, adding a seasoning of pepper\r\nand salt. This sandwich may be varied by adding a little pulled meat, or\r\nvery fine slices of cold meat, to the toast, and in any of these forms\r\nwill be found very tempting to the appetite of an invalid.\r\n\r\n\r\n1878. Besides the recipes contained in this chapter, there are, in the\r\nprevious chapters on cookery, many others suitable for invalids, which\r\nit would be useless to repeat here. Recipes for fish simply dressed,\r\nlight soups, plain roast meat, well-dressed vegetables, poultry, simple\r\npuddings, jelly, stewed fruits, &c. &c., all of which dishes may be\r\npartaken of by invalids and convalescents, will be found in preceding\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDINNERS AND DINING.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\n\r\n1879. Man, it has been said, is a dining animal. Creatures of the\r\ninferior races eat and drink; man only dines. It has also been said that\r\nhe is a cooking animal; but some races eat food without cooking it. A\r\nCroat captain said to M. Brillat Savarin, \"When, in campaign, we feel\r\nhungry, we knock over the first animal we find, cut off a steak, powder\r\nit with salt, put it under the saddle, gallop over it for half a mile,\r\nand then eat it.\" Huntsmen in Dauphiny, when out shooting, have been\r\nknown to kill a bird, pluck it, salt and pepper it, and cook it by\r\ncarrying it some time in their caps. It is equally true that some races\r\nof men do not dine any more than the tiger or the vulture. It is not a\r\n_dinner_ at which sits the aboriginal Australian, who gnaws his bone\r\nhalf bare and then flings it behind to his squaw. And the native of\r\nTerra-del-Fuego does not dine when he gets his morsel of red clay.\r\nDining is the privilege of civilization. The rank which a people occupy\r\nin the grand scale may be measured by their way of taking their meals,\r\nas well as by their way of treating their women. The nation which knows\r\nhow to dine has learnt the leading lesson of progress. It implies both\r\nthe will and the skill to reduce to order, and surround with idealisms\r\nand graces, the more material conditions of human existence; and\r\nwherever that will and that skill exist, life cannot be wholly ignoble.\r\n\r\n1880. Dinner, being the grand solid meal of the day, is a matter of\r\nconsiderable importance; and a well-served table is a striking index of\r\nhuman, ingenuity and resource. \"Their table,\" says Lord Byron, in\r\ndescribing a dinner-party given by Lord and Lady Amundevillo at Norman\r\nAbbey,--\r\n\r\n  \"Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts\r\n  To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.\r\n  I will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts,\r\n  Albeit all human history attests\r\n  That happiness for man--the hungry sinner!--\r\n  Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he goes on to observe upon the curious complexity of the\r\nresults produced by human cleverness and application catering for the\r\nmodifications which occur in civilized life, one of the simplest of the\r\nprimal instincts:--\r\n\r\n  \"The mind is lost in mighty contemplation\r\n  Of intellect expended on two courses;\r\n  And indigestion's grand multiplication\r\n  Requires arithmetic beyond my forces.\r\n  Who would suppose, from Adam's simple ration,\r\n  That cookery could have call'd forth such resources,\r\n  As form a science and a nomenclature\r\n  From out the commonest demands of nature?\"\r\n\r\nAnd we may well say, Who, indeed, would suppose it? The gulf between the\r\nCroat, with a steak under his saddle, and Alexis Soyer getting up a\r\ngreat dinner at the Reform-Club, or even Thackeray's Mrs. Raymond Gray\r\ngiving \"a little dinner\" to Mr. Snob (with one of those famous\r\n\"roly-poly puddings\" of hers),--what a gulf it is!\r\n\r\n1881. That Adam's \"ration,\" however, was \"simple,\" is a matter on which\r\nwe have contrary judgments given by the poets. When Raphael paid that\r\nmemorable visit to Paradise,--which we are expressly told by Milton he\r\ndid exactly at dinner-time,--Eve seems to have prepared \"a little\r\ndinner\" not wholly destitute of complexity, and to have added ice-creams\r\nand perfumes. Nothing can be clearer than the testimony of the poet on\r\nthese points:--\r\n\r\n  \"And Eve within, due at her home prepared\r\n  For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please\r\n  True appetite, and not disrelish thirst\r\n  Of nectarous draughts between....\r\n  .... With dispatchful looks in haste\r\n  She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent,\r\n  What choice to choose for delicacy best,\r\n  What order so contrived as not to mix\r\n  Tastes not well join'd, inelegant, but bring\r\n  Taste after taste, upheld with kindliest change--\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n  \"She _tempers dulcet creams_....\r\n  .... _then strews the ground\r\n  With rose and odours._\"\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, in passing, that the poets, though they have more to\r\nsay about wine than solid food, because the former more directly\r\nstimulates the intellect and the feelings, do not flinch from the\r\nsubject of eating and drinking. There is infinite zest in the above\r\npassage from Milton, and even more in the famous description of a dainty\r\nsupper, given by Keats in his \"Eve of Saint Agnes.\" Could Queen Mab\r\nherself desire to sit down to anything nicer, both as to its\r\nappointments and serving, and as to its quality, than the collation\r\nserved by Porphyro in the lady's bedroom while she slept?--\r\n\r\n  \"There by the bedside, where the faded moon\r\n  Made a dim silver twilight, soft he set\r\n  A table, and, half-anguish'd, threw thereor\r\n  A cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet.\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n  \"While he, from forth the closet, brought a heap\r\n  Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd;\r\n  With jellies smoother than the creamy curd,\r\n  And lucent syrups tinct with cinnamon;\r\n  Manna and dates, in argosy transferr'd\r\n  From Fez; and spiced dainties, every one,\r\n  From silken Samarcand to cedar'd Lebanon.\"\r\n\r\nBut Tennyson has ventured beyond dates, and quinces, and syrups, which\r\nmay be thought easy to be brought in by a poet. In his idyl of \"Audley\r\nCourt\" he gives a most appetizing description of a pasty at a pic-nic:--\r\n\r\n  \"There, on a slope of orchard, Francis laid\r\n  A damask napkin wrought with horse and hound;\r\n  Brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home,\r\n  And, half cut down, a pasty costly made,\r\n  Where quail and pigeon, lark and leveret, lay\r\n  Like fossils of the rock, with golden yolks\r\n  Imbedded and injellied.\"\r\n\r\nWe gladly quote passages like these, to show how eating and drinking may\r\nbe surrounded with poetical associations, and how man, using his\r\nprivilege to turn any and every repast into a \"feast of reason,\" with a\r\nwarm and plentiful \"flow of soul,\" may really count it as not the least\r\nof his legitimate prides, that he is \"a dining animal.\"\r\n\r\n1882. It has been said, indeed, that great men, in general, are great\r\ndiners. This, however, can scarcely be true of any great men but men of\r\naction; and, in that case, it would simply imply that persons of\r\nvigorous constitution, who work hard, eat heartily; for, of course, a\r\nlife of action _requires_ a vigorous constitution, even though there may\r\nbe much illness, as in such cases as William III. and our brave General\r\nNapier. Of men of thought, it can scarcely be true that they eat so\r\nmuch, in a general way, though even they eat more than they are apt to\r\nsuppose they do; for, as Mr. Lewes observes, \"nerve-tissue is very\r\nexpensive.\" Leaving great men of all kinds, however, to get their own\r\ndinners, let us, who are not great, look after ours. Dine we must, and\r\nwe may as well dine elegantly as well as wholesomely.\r\n\r\n1883. There are plenty of elegant dinners in modern days, and they were\r\nnot wanting in ancient times. It is well known that the dinner-party, or\r\nsymposium, was a not unimportant, and not unpoetical, feature in the\r\nlife of the sociable, talkative, tasteful Greek. Douglas Jerrold said\r\nthat such is the British humour for dining and giving of dinners, that\r\nif London were to be destroyed by an earthquake, the Londoners would\r\nmeet at a public dinner to consider the subject. The Greeks, too, were\r\ngreat diners: their social and religious polity gave them many chances\r\nof being merry and making others merry on good eating and drinking. Any\r\npublic or even domestic sacrifice to one of the gods, was sure to be\r\nfollowed by a dinner-party, the remains of the slaughtered \"offering\"\r\nbeing served up on the occasion as a pious _pièce de résistance;_ and as\r\nthe different gods, goddesses, and demigods, worshipped by the community\r\nin general, or by individuals, were very numerous indeed, and some very\r\nreligious people never let a day pass without offering up something or\r\nother, the dinner-parties were countless. A birthday, too, was an excuse\r\nfor a dinner; a birthday, that is, of any person long dead and buried,\r\nas well as of a living person, being a member of the family, or\r\notherwise esteemed. Dinners were, of course, eaten on all occasions of\r\npublic rejoicing. Then, among the young people, subscription dinners,\r\nvery much after the manner of modern times, were always being got up;\r\nonly that they would be eaten not at an hotel, but probably at the house\r\nof one of the _heterae_. A Greek dinner-party was a handsome,\r\nwell-regulated affair. The guests came in elegantly dressed and crowned\r\nwith flowers. A slave, approaching each person as he entered, took off\r\nhis sandals and washed his feet. During the repast, the guests reclined\r\non couches with pillows, among and along which were set small tables.\r\nAfter the solid meal came the \"symposium\" proper, a scene of music,\r\nmerriment, and dancing, the two latter being supplied chiefly by young\r\ngirls. There was a chairman, or symposiarch, appointed by the company to\r\nregulate the drinking; and it was his duty to mix the wine in the\r\n\"mighty bowl.\" From this bowl the attendants ladled the liquor into\r\ngoblets, and, with the goblets, went round and round the tables, filling\r\nthe cups of the guests.\r\n\r\n1884. The elegance with which a dinner is served is a matter which\r\ndepends, of course, partly upon the means, but still more upon the taste\r\nof the master and mistress of the house. It may be observed, in general,\r\nthat there should always be flowers on the table, and as they form no\r\nitem of expense, there is no reason why they should not be employed\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\n1885. The variety in the dishes which furnish forth a modern\r\ndinner-table, does not necessarily imply anything unwholesome, or\r\nanything capricious. Food that is not well relished cannot be well\r\ndigested; and the appetite of the over-worked man of business, or\r\nstatesman, or of any dweller in towns, whose occupations are exciting\r\nand exhausting, is jaded, and requires stimulation. Men and women who\r\nare in rude health, and who have plenty of air and exercise, eat the\r\nsimplest food with relish, and consequently digest it well; but those\r\nconditions are out of the reach of many men. They must suit their mode\r\nof dining to their mode of living, if they cannot choose the latter. It\r\nis in serving up food that is at once appetizing and wholesome that the\r\nskill of the modern housewife is severely tasked; and she has scarcely a\r\nmore important duty to fulfil. It is, in fact, her particular vocation,\r\nin virtue of which she may be said to hold the health of the family, and\r\nof the friends of the family, in her hands from day to day. It has been\r\nsaid that \"the destiny of nations depends on the manner in which they\r\nare fed;\" and a great gastronomist exclaims, \"Tell me what kind of food\r\nyou eat, and I will tell you what kind of man you are.\" The same writer\r\nhas some sentences of the same kind, which are rather hyperbolical, but\r\nworth quoting:--\"The pleasures of the table belong to all ages, to all\r\nconditions, to all countries, and to all eras; they mingle with all\r\nother pleasures, and remain, at last, to console us for their departure.\r\nThe discovery of a new dish confers more happiness upon humanity than\r\nthe discovery of a new star.\"\r\n\r\n1886. The gastronomist from whom we have already quoted, has some\r\naphorisms and short directions in relation to dinner-parties, which are\r\nwell deserving of notice:--\"Let the number of your guests never exceed\r\ntwelve, so that the conversation may be general. [Footnote: We have seen\r\nthis varied by saying that the number should never exceed that of the\r\nMuses or fall below that of the Graces.] Let the temperature of the\r\ndining-room be about 68°. Let the dishes be few in number in the first\r\ncourse, but proportionally good. The order of food is from the most\r\nsubstantial to the lightest. The order of drinking wine is from the\r\nmildest to the most foamy and most perfumed. To invite a person to your\r\nhouse is to take charge of his happiness so long as he is beneath your\r\nroof. The mistress of the house should always be certain that the coffee\r\nbe excellent; whilst the master should be answerable for the quality of\r\nhis wines and liqueurs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBILLS OF FARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY.\r\n\r\n1887.--DINNER FOR 18 PERSONS.\r\n\r\n  _First Course._\r\n\r\n                   Mock Turtle Soup,\r\n                      removed by\r\n               Cod's Head and Shoulders.\r\n\r\n  Stewed Eels.

A menu or bill of fare should be laid\r\nby the side of each guest.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENU.\r\n\r\n2138.--SERVICE A LA RUSSE (November).\r\n\r\n  Ox-tail Soup.\r\n  Soup à la Jardinière.\r\n\r\n  Turbot and Lobster Sauce.\r\n  Crimped Cod and Oyster Sauce.\r\n\r\n  Stewed Eels.\r\n  Soles à la Normandie.\r\n\r\n  Pike and Cream Sauce.\r\n  Fried Filleted Soles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Filets de Boeuf à la Jardinière.\r\n  Croquettes of Game aux Champignons.\r\n\r\n  Chicken Cutlets.\r\n  Mutton Cutlets and Tomata Sauce.\r\n\r\n  Lobster Rissoles.\r\n  Oyster Patties.\r\n\r\n  Partridges aux fines herbes.\r\n  Larded Sweetbreads.\r\n\r\n  Roast Beef.\r\n  Poulets aux Cressons.\r\n\r\n  Haunch of Mutton.\r\n  Roast Turkey.\r\n\r\n  Boiled Turkey and Celery Sauce.\r\n  Ham.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Grouse.\r\n  Pheasants.\r\n  Hare.\r\n\r\n  Salad.\r\n  Artichokes.\r\n  Stewed Celery.\r\n\r\n  Italian Cream.\r\n  Charlotte aux Pommes.\r\n  Compôte of Pears.\r\n\r\n  Croûtes madrées aux Fruits.\r\n  Pastry.\r\n  Punch Jelly.\r\n\r\n  Iced Pudding.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DESSERT AND ICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note._--Dinners à la Russe are scarcely suitable for small\r\nestablishments; a large number of servants being required to carve; and\r\nto help the guests; besides there being a necessity for more plates,\r\ndishes, knives, forks, and spoons, than are usually to be found in any\r\nother than a very large establishment. Where, however, a service à la\r\nRusse is practicable, there it, perhaps, no mode of serving a dinner so\r\nenjoyable as this.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPERS.\r\n\r\n2139. Much may be done in the arrangement of a supper-table, at a very\r\nsmall expense, provided _taste_ and _ingenuity_ are exercised. The\r\ncolours and flavours of the various dishes should contrast nicely; there\r\nshould be plenty of fruit and flowers on the table, and the room should\r\nbe well lighted. We have endeavoured to show how the various dishes may\r\nbe placed; but of course these little matters entirely depend on the\r\nlength and width of the table used, on individual taste, whether the\r\ntables are arranged round the room, whether down the centre, with a\r\ncross one at the top, or whether the supper is laid in two separate\r\nrooms, &c. &c. The garnishing of the dishes has also much to do with the\r\nappearance of a supper-table. Hams and tongues should be ornamented with\r\ncut vegetable flowers, raised pies with aspic jelly cut in dice, and all\r\nthe dishes garnished sufficiently to be in good taste without looking\r\nabsurd. The eye, in fact, should be as much gratified as the palate. Hot\r\nsoup is now often served at suppers, but is not placed on the table. The\r\nservants fill the plates from a tureen on the buffet, and then hand them\r\nto the guests: when these plates are removed, the business of supper\r\ncommences.\r\n\r\n2140. Where small rooms and large parties necessitate having a standing\r\nsupper, many things enumerated in the following bill of fare may be\r\nplaced on the buffet. Dishes for these suppers should be selected which\r\nmay be eaten standing without any trouble. The following list may,\r\nperhaps, assist our readers in the arrangement of a buffet for a\r\nstanding supper.\r\n\r\n2141. Beef, ham, and tongue sandwiches, lobster and oyster patties,\r\nsausage rolls, meat rolls, lobster salad, dishes of fowls, the latter\r\n_all cut up_; dishes of sliced ham, sliced tongue, sliced beef, and\r\ngalantine of veal; various jellies, blancmanges, and creams; custards in\r\nglasses, compôtes of fruit, tartlets of jam, and several dishes of small\r\nfancy pastry; dishes of fresh fruit, bonbons, sweetmeats, two or three\r\nsponge cakes, a few plates of biscuits, and the buffet ornamented with\r\nvases of fresh or artificial flowers. The above dishes are quite\r\nsufficient for a standing supper; where more are desired, a supper must\r\nthen be laid and arranged in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n2142.--BILL OF FARE FOR A BALL SUPPER FOR 60 PERSONS (For Winter)\r\n\r\n                                  Boar's Head,\r\n                          garnished with Aspic Jelly.\r\n  Lobster Salad                                        Lobster Salad.\r\n  Fruited Jelly.

A few dishes of fowls, lobster\r\nsalads, &c. &c., should be kept in reserve to replenish those that are\r\nmost likely to be eaten first. A joint of cold roast and boiled beef\r\nshould be placed on the buffet, as being something substantial for the\r\ngentlemen of the party to partake of. Besides the articles enumerated in\r\nthe bill of fare, biscuits and wafers will be required, cream-and-water\r\nices, tea, coffee, wines, liqueurs, soda-water, ginger-beer, and\r\nlemonade.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAKFASTS.\r\n\r\n2144. It will not be necessary to give here a long bill of fare of cold\r\njoints, &c., which may be placed on the side-board, and do duty at the\r\nbreakfast-table. Suffice it to say, that any cold meat the larder may\r\nfurnish, should be nicely garnished, and be placed on the buffet.\r\nCollared and potted meats or fish, cold game or poultry, veal-and-ham\r\npies, game-and-Rump-steak pies, are all suitable dishes for the\r\nbreakfast-table; as also cold ham, tongue, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n2145. The following list of hot dishes may perhaps assist our readers in\r\nknowing what to provide for the comfortable meal called breakfast.\r\nBroiled fish, such as mackerel, whiting, herrings, dried haddocks, &c.;\r\nmutton chops and rump-steaks, broiled sheep's kidneys, kidneys à la\r\nmaître d'hôtel, sausages, plain rashers of bacon, bacon and poached\r\neggs, ham and poached eggs, omelets, plain boiled eggs, oeufs-au-plat,\r\npoached eggs on toast, muffins, toast, marmalade, butter, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n2146. In the summer, and when they are obtainable, always have a vase of\r\nfreshly-gathered flowers on the breakfast-table, and, when convenient, a\r\nnicely-arranged dish of fruit: when strawberries are in season, these\r\nare particularly refreshing; as also grapes, or even currants.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNCHEONS AND SUPPERS.\r\n\r\n2147. The remains of cold joints, nicely garnished, a few sweets, or a\r\nlittle hashed meat, poultry or game, are the usual articles placed on\r\nthe table for luncheon, with bread and cheese, biscuits, butter, &c. If\r\na substantial meal is desired, rump-steaks or mutton chops may he\r\nserved, as also veal cutlets, kidneys, or any dish of that kind. In\r\nfamilies where there is a nursery, the mistress of the house often\r\npartakes of the meal with the children, and makes it her luncheon. In\r\nthe summer, a few dishes of fresh fruit should be added to the luncheon,\r\nor, instead of this, a compote of fruit or fruit tart, or pudding.\r\n\r\n2148. Of suppers we have little to say, as we have already given two\r\nbills of fare for a large party, which will answer very well for a\r\nsmaller number, by reducing the quantity of dishes and by omitting a\r\nfew. Hot suppers are now very little in request, as people now generally\r\ndine at an hour which precludes the possibility of requiring supper; at\r\nall events, not one of a substantial kind. Should, however, a bill of\r\nfare be required, one of those under the head of DINNERS, with slight\r\nalterations, will be found to answer for a hot supper.\r\n\r\n\r\nBILL OF FARE FOR A PICNIC FOR 40 PERSONS.\r\n\r\n2149. A joint of cold roast beef, a joint of cold boiled beef, 2 ribs of\r\nlamb, 2 shoulders of lamb, 4 roast fowls, 2 roast ducks, 1 ham, 1\r\ntongue, 2 veal-and-ham pies, 2 pigeon pies, 6 medium-sized lobsters, 1\r\npiece of collared calf's head, 18 lettuces, 6 baskets of salad, 6\r\ncucumbers.\r\n\r\n2150. Stewed fruit well sweetened, and put into glass bottles well\r\ncorked; 3 or 4 dozen plain pastry biscuits to eat with the stewed fruit,\r\n2 dozen fruit turnovers, 4 dozen cheesecakes, 2 cold cabinet puddings in\r\nmoulds, 2 blancmanges in moulds, a few jam puffs, 1 large cold\r\nplum-pudding (this must be good), a few baskets of fresh fruit, 3 dozen\r\nplain biscuits, a piece of cheese, 6 lbs. of butter (this, of course,\r\nincludes the butter for tea), 4 quartern loaves of household broad, 3\r\ndozen rolls, 6 loaves of tin bread (for tea), 2 plain plum cakes, 2\r\npound cakes, 2 sponge cakes, a tin of mixed biscuits, 1/2 lb, of tea.\r\nCoffee is not suitable for a picnic, being difficult to make.\r\n\r\nThings not to be forgotten at a Picnic.\r\n\r\n2151. A stick of horseradish, a bottle of mint-sauce well corked, a\r\nbottle of salad dressing, a bottle of vinegar, made mustard, pepper,\r\nsalt, good oil, and pounded sugar. If it can be managed, take a little\r\nice. It is scarcely necessary to say that plates, tumblers,\r\nwine-glasses, knives, forks, and spoons, must not be forgotten; as also\r\nteacups and saucers, 3 or 4 teapots, some lump sugar, and milk, if this\r\nlast-named article cannot be obtained in the neighbourhood. Take 3\r\ncorkscrews.\r\n\r\n2152. _Beverages_.--3 dozen quart bottles of ale, packed in hampers;\r\nginger-beer, soda-water, and lemonade, of each 2 dozen bottles; 6\r\nbottles of sherry, 6 bottles of claret, champagne à discrétion, and any\r\nother light wine that may be preferred, and 2 bottles of brandy. Water\r\ncan usually be obtained so it is useless to take it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC SERVANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\n2153. It is the custom of \"Society\" to abuse its servants,--_a façon de\r\nparler_, such as leads their lords and masters to talk of the weather,\r\nand, when rurally inclined, of the crops,--leads matronly ladies, and\r\nladies just entering on their probation in that honoured and honourable\r\nstate, to talk of servants, and, as we are told, wax eloquent over the\r\ngreatest plague in life while taking a quiet cup of tea. Young men at\r\ntheir clubs, also, we are told, like to abuse their \"fellows,\" perhaps\r\nnot without a certain pride and pleasure at the opportunity of\r\nintimating that they enjoy such appendages to their state. It is another\r\nconviction of \"Society\" that the race of good servants has died out, at\r\nleast in England, although they do order these things better in France;\r\nthat there is neither honesty, conscientiousness, nor the careful and\r\nindustrious habits which distinguished the servants of our grandmothers\r\nand great-grandmothers; that domestics no longer know their place; that\r\nthe introduction of cheap silks and cottons, and, still more recently,\r\nthose ambiguous \"materials\" and tweeds, have removed the landmarks\r\nbetween the mistress and her maid, between the master and his man.\r\n\r\n2154. When the distinction really depends on things so insignificant,\r\nthis is very probably the case; when the lady of fashion chooses her\r\nfootman without any other consideration than his height, shape, and\r\n_tournure_ of his calf, it is not surprising that she should find a\r\ndomestic who has no attachment for the family, who considers the figure\r\nhe cuts behind her carriage, and the late hours he is compelled to keep,\r\na full compensation for the wages he exacts, for the food he wastes, and\r\nfor the perquisites he can lay his hands on. Nor should the fast young\r\nman, who chooses his groom for his knowingness in the ways of the turf\r\nand in the tricks of low horse-dealers, be surprised if he is sometimes\r\nthe victim of these learned ways. But these are the exceptional cases,\r\nwhich prove the existence of a better state of things. The great masses\r\nof society among us are not thus deserted; there are few families of\r\nrespectability, from the shopkeeper in the next street to the nobleman\r\nwhose mansion dignifies the next square, which do not contain among\r\ntheir dependents attached and useful servants; and where these are\r\nabsent altogether, there are good reasons for it. The sensible master\r\nand the kind mistress know, that if servants depend on them for their\r\nmeans of living, in their turn they are dependent on their servants for\r\nvery many of the comforts of life; and that, with a proper amount of\r\ncare in choosing servants, and treating them like reasonable beings, and\r\nmaking slight excuses for the shortcomings of human nature, they will,\r\nsave in some exceptional case, be tolerably well served, and, in most\r\ninstances, surround themselves with attached domestics.\r\n\r\n2155. This remark, which is applicable to all domestics, is especially\r\nso to men-servants. Families accustomed to such attendants have always\r\nabout them humble dependents, whose children have no other prospect than\r\ndomestic service to look forward to; to them it presents no degradation,\r\nbut the reverse, to be so employed; they are initiated step by step into\r\nthe mysteries of the household, with the prospect of rising in the\r\nservice, if it is a house admitting of promotion,--to the respectable\r\nposition of butler or house-steward. In families of humbler pretensions,\r\nwhere they must look for promotion elsewhere, they know that can only be\r\nattained by acquiring the goodwill of their employers. Can there be any\r\nstronger security for their good conduct,--any doubt that, in the mass\r\nof domestic servants, good conduct is the rule, the reverse the\r\nexception?\r\n\r\n2156. The number of the male domestics in a family varies according to\r\nthe wealth and position of the master, from the owner of the ducal\r\nmansion, with a retinue of attendants, at the head of which is the\r\nchamberlain and house-steward, to the occupier of the humbler house,\r\nwhere a single footman, or even the odd man-of-all-work, is the only\r\nmale retainer. The majority of gentlemen's establishments probably\r\ncomprise a servant out of livery, or butler, a footman, and coachman, or\r\ncoachman and groom, where the horses exceed two or three.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE BUTLER.\r\n\r\n2157. The domestic duties of the butler are to bring in the eatables at\r\nbreakfast, and wait upon the family at that meal, assisted by the\r\nfootman, and see to the cleanliness of everything at table. On taking\r\naway, he removes the tray with the china and plate, for which he is\r\nresponsible. At luncheon, he arranges the meal, and waits unassisted,\r\nthe footman being now engaged in other duties. At dinner, he places the\r\nsilver and plated articles on the table, sees that everything is in its\r\nplace, and rectifies what is wrong. He carries in the first dish, and\r\nannounces in the drawing-room that dinner is on the table, and\r\nrespectfully stands by the door until the company are seated, when he\r\ntakes his place behind his master's chair on the left, to remove the\r\ncovers, handing them to the other attendants to carry out. After the\r\nfirst course of plates is supplied, his place is at the sideboard to\r\nserve the wines, but only when called on.\r\n\r\n2158. The first course ended, he rings the cook's bell, and hands the\r\ndishes from the table to the other servants to carry away, receiving\r\nfrom them the second course, which he places on the table, removing the\r\ncovers as before, and again taking his place at the sideboard.\r\n\r\n2159. At dessert, the slips being removed, the butler receives the\r\ndessert from the other servants, and arranges it on the table, with\r\nplates and glasses, and then takes his place behind his master's chair\r\nto hand the wines and ices, while the footman stands behind his mistress\r\nfor the same purpose, the other attendants leaving the room. Where the\r\nold-fashioned practice of having the dessert on the polished table,\r\nwithout any cloth, is still adhered to, the butler should rub off any\r\nmarks made by the hot dishes before arranging the dessert.\r\n\r\n2160. Before dinner, he has satisfied himself that the lamps, candles,\r\nor gas-burners are in perfect order, if not lighted, which will usually\r\nbe the case. Having served every one with their share of the dessert,\r\nput the fires in order (when these are used), and seen the lights are\r\nall right, at a signal from his master, he and the footman leave the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n2161. He now proceeds to the drawing-room, arranges the fireplace, and\r\nsees to the lights; he then returns to his pantry, prepared to answer\r\nthe bell, and attend to the company, while the footman is clearing away\r\nand cleaning the plate and glasses.\r\n\r\n2162. At tea he again attends. At bedtime he appears with the candles;\r\nhe locks up the plate, secures doors and windows, and sees that all the\r\nfires are safe.\r\n\r\n2163. In addition to these duties, the butler, where only one footman is\r\nkept, will be required to perform some of the duties of the valet, to\r\npay bills, and superintend the other servants. But the real duties of\r\nthe butler are in the wine-cellar; there he should be competent to\r\nadvise his master as to the price and quality of the wine to be laid in;\r\n\"fine,\" bottle, cork, and seal it, and place it in the binns. Brewing,\r\nracking, and bottling malt liquors, belong to his office, as well as\r\ntheir distribution. These and other drinkables are brought from the\r\ncellar every day by his own hands, except where an under-butler is kept;\r\nand a careful entry of every bottle used, entered in the cellar-book; so\r\nthat the book should always show the contents of the cellar.\r\n\r\n    2164. The office of butler is thus one of very great trust in a\r\n    household. Here, as elsewhere, honesty is the best policy: the\r\n    butler should make it his business to understand the proper\r\n    treatment of the different wines under his charge, which he can\r\n    easily do from the wine-merchant, and faithfully attend to it;\r\n    his own reputation will soon compensate for the absence of\r\n    bribes from unprincipled wine-merchants, if he serves a generous\r\n    and hospitable master. Nothing spreads more rapidly in society\r\n    than the reputation of a good wine-cellar, and all that is\r\n    required is wines well chosen and well cared for; and this a\r\n    little knowledge, carefully applied, will soon supply.\r\n\r\n2165. The butler, we have said, has charge of the contents of the\r\ncellars, and it is his duty to keep them in a proper condition, to fine\r\ndown wine in wood, bottle it off, and store it away in places suited to\r\nthe sorts. Where wine comes into the cellar ready bottled, it is usual\r\nto return the same number of empty bottles; the butler has not, in this\r\ncase, the same inducements to keep the bottles of the different sorts\r\nseparated; but where the wine is bottled in the house, he will find his\r\naccount, not only in keeping them separate, but in rinsing them well,\r\nand even washing them with clean water as soon as they are empty.\r\n\r\n    2166. There are various modes of fining wine: isinglass,\r\n    gelatine, and gum Arabic are all used for the purpose. Whichever\r\n    of these articles is used, the process is always the same.\r\n    Supposing eggs (the cheapest) to be used,--Draw a gallon or so\r\n    of the wine, and mix one quart of it with the whites of four\r\n    eggs, by stirring it with a whisk; afterwards, when thoroughly\r\n    mixed, pour it back into the cask through the bunghole, and stir\r\n    up the whole cask, in a rotatory direction, with a clean split\r\n    stick inserted through the bunghole. Having stirred it\r\n    sufficiently, pour in the remainder of the wine drawn off, until\r\n    the cask is full; then stir again, skimming off the bubbles that\r\n    rise to the surface. When thoroughly mixed by stirring, close\r\n    the bunghole, and leave it to stand for three or four days. This\r\n    quantity of clarified wine will fine thirteen dozen of port or\r\n    sherry. The other clearing ingredients are applied in the same\r\n    manner, the material being cut into small pieces, and dissolved\r\n    in the quart of wine, and the cask stirred in the same manner.\r\n\r\n    2167. _To Bottle Wine_.--Having thoroughly washed and dried the\r\n    bottles, supposing they have been before used for the same kind\r\n    of wine, provide corks, which will be improved by being slightly\r\n    boiled, or at least steeped in hot water,--a wooden hammer or\r\n    mallet, a bottling-boot, and a squeezer for the corks. Bore a\r\n    hole in the lower part of the cask with a gimlet, receiving the\r\n    liquid stream which follows in the bottle and filterer, which is\r\n    placed in a tub or basin. This operation is best performed by\r\n    two persons, one to draw the wine, the other to cork the\r\n    bottles. The drawer is to see that the bottles are up to the\r\n    mark, but not too full, the bottle being placed in a clean tub\r\n    to prevent waste. The corking-boot is buckled by a strap to the\r\n    knee, the bottle placed in it, and the cork, after being\r\n    squeezed in the press, driven in by a flat wooden mallet.\r\n\r\n    2168. As the wine draws near to the bottom of the cask, a thick\r\n    piece of muslin is placed in the strainer, to prevent the\r\n    viscous grounds from passing into the bottle.\r\n\r\n    2169. Having carefully counted the bottles, they are stored away\r\n    in their respective binns, a layer of sand or sawdust being\r\n    placed under the first tier, and another over it; a second tier\r\n    is laid over this, protected by a lath, the head of the second\r\n    being laid to the bottom of the first; over this another bed of\r\n    sawdust is laid, not too thick, another lath; and so on till the\r\n    binn is filled.\r\n\r\n    2170. Wine so laid in will be ready for use according to its\r\n    quality and age. Port wine, old in the wood, will be ready to\r\n    drink in five or six months; but if it is a fruity wine, it will\r\n    improve every year. Sherry, if of good quality, will be fit to\r\n    drink as soon as the \"sickness\" (as its first condition after\r\n    bottling is called) ceases, and will also improve; but the\r\n    cellar must be kept at a perfectly steady temperature, neither\r\n    too hot nor too cold, but about 55° or 60°, and absolutely free\r\n    from draughts of cold air.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE FOOTMAN.\r\n\r\n2171. Where a single footman, or odd man, is the only male servant,\r\nthen, whatever his ostensible position, he is required to make himself\r\ngenerally useful. He has to clean the knives and shoes, the furniture,\r\nthe plate; answer the visitors who call, the drawing-room and parlour\r\nbells; and do all the errands. His life is no sinecure; and a methodical\r\narrangement of his time will be necessary, in order to perform his many\r\nduties with any satisfaction to himself or his master.\r\n\r\n    2172. The footman only finds himself in stockings, shoes, and\r\n    washing. Where silk stockings, or other extra articles of linen\r\n    are worn, they are found by the family, as well as his livery, a\r\n    working dress, consisting of a pair of overalls, a waistcoat, a\r\n    fustian jacket, with a white or jean one for times when he is\r\n    liable to be called to answer the door or wait at breakfast;\r\n    and, on quitting his service, he is expected to leave behind him\r\n    any livery had within six months.\r\n\r\n2173. The footman is expected to rise early, in order to get through all\r\nhis dirty work before the family are stirring. Boots and shoes, and\r\nknives and forks, should be cleaned, lamps in use trimmed, his master's\r\nclothes brushed, the furniture rubbed over; so that he may put aside his\r\nworking dress, tidy himself, and appear in a clean jean jacket to lay\r\nthe cloth and prepare breakfast for the family.\r\n\r\n    2174. We need hardly dwell on the boot-cleaning process: three\r\n    good brushes and good blacking must be provided; one of the\r\n    brushes hard, to brush off the mud; the other soft, to lay on\r\n    the blacking; the third of a medium hardness, for polishing; and\r\n    each should be kept for its particular use. The blacking should\r\n    be kept corked up, except when in use, and applied to the brush\r\n    with a sponge tied to a stick, which, when put away, rests in a\r\n    notch cut in the cork. When boots come in very muddy, it is a\r\n    good practice to wash off the mud, and wipe them dry with a\r\n    sponge; then leave them to dry very gradually on their sides,\r\n    taking care they are not placed near the fire, or scorched. Much\r\n    delicacy of treatment is required in cleaning ladies' boots, so\r\n    as to make the leather look well-polished, and the upper part\r\n    retain a fresh appearance, with the lining free from hand-marks,\r\n    which are very offensive to a lady of refined tastes.\r\n\r\n    2175. Patent leather boots require to be wiped with a wet\r\n    sponge, and afterwards with a soft dry cloth, and occasionally\r\n    with a soft cloth and sweet oil, blacking and polishing the edge\r\n    of the soles in the usual way, but so as not to cover the patent\r\n    polish with blacking. A little milk may also be used with very\r\n    good effect for patent leather boots.\r\n\r\n    2176. Top boots are still occasionally worn by gentlemen. While\r\n    cleaning the lower part in the usual manner, protect the tops,\r\n    by inserting a cloth or brown paper under the edges and bringing\r\n    it over them. In cleaning the tops, let the covering fall down\r\n    over the boot; wash the tops clean with soap and flannel, and\r\n    rub out any spots with pumice-stone. If the tops are to be\r\n    whiter, dissolve an ounce of oxalic acid and half an ounce of\r\n    pumice-stone in a pint of soft water; if a brown colour is\r\n    intended, mix an ounce of muriatic acid, half an ounce of alum,\r\n    half an ounce of gum Arabic, and half an ounce of spirit of\r\n    lavender, in a pint and a half of skimmed milk \"turned.\" These\r\n    mixtures apply by means of a sponge, and polish, when dry, with\r\n    a rubber made of soft flannel.\r\n\r\n    2177. Knives are now generally cleaned by means of Kent's or\r\n    Masters's machine, which gives very little trouble, and is very\r\n    effective; before, however, putting the knives into the machine,\r\n    it is highly necessary that they be first washed in a little\r\n    warm (not hot) water, and then thoroughly wiped: if put into the\r\n    machine with any grease on them, it adheres to the brushes, and\r\n    consequently renders them unfit to use for the next knives that\r\n    may be put in. When this precaution is not taken, the machine\r\n    must come to pieces, so causing an immense amount of trouble,\r\n    which may all be avoided by having the knives thoroughly free\r\n    from grease before using the machine. Brushes are also used for\r\n    cleaning forks, which facilitate the operation. When knives are\r\n    so cleaned, see that they are carefully polished, wiped, and\r\n    with a good edge, the ferules and prongs free from dirt, and\r\n    place them in the basket with the handles all one way.\r\n\r\n    2178. Lamp-trimming requires a thorough acquaintance with the\r\n    mechanism; after that, constant attention to cleanliness, and an\r\n    occasional entire clearing out with hot water: when this is\r\n    done, all the parts should be carefully dried before filling\r\n    again with oil. When lacquered, wipe the lacquered parts with a\r\n    soft brush and cloth, and wash occasionally with weak soapsuds,\r\n    wiping carefully afterwards. Brass lamps may be cleaned with oil\r\n    and rottenstone every day when trimmed. With bronze, and other\r\n    ornamental lamps, more care will be required, and soft flannel\r\n    and oil only used, to prevent the removal of the bronze or\r\n    enamel. Brass-work, or any metal-work not lacquered, is cleaned\r\n    by a little oil and rottenstone made into a paste, or with fine\r\n    emery-powder and oil mixed in the same manner. A small portion\r\n    of sal ammoniac, beat into a fine powder and moistened with soft\r\n    water, rubbed over brass ornaments, and heated over a charcoal\r\n    fire, and rubbed dry with bran or whitening, will give to\r\n    brass-work the brilliancy of gold. In trimming moderator lamps,\r\n    let the wick be cut evenly all round; as, if left higher in one\r\n    place than it is in another, it will cause it to smoke and burn\r\n    badly. The lamp should then be filled with oil from a feeder,\r\n    and afterwards well wiped with a cloth or rag kept for the\r\n    purpose. If it can be avoided, never wash the chimneys of a\r\n    lamp, as it causes them to crack when they become hot. Small\r\n    sticks, covered with wash-leather pads, are the best things to\r\n    use for cleaning the glasses inside, and a clean duster for\r\n    polishing the outside. The globe of a moderator lamp should be\r\n    occasionally washed in warm soap-and-water, then well rinsed in\r\n    cold water, and either wiped dry or left to drain. Where\r\n    candle-lamps are used, take out the springs occasionally, and\r\n    free them well from the grease that adheres to them.\r\n\r\n    2179. French polish, so universally applied to furniture, is\r\n    easily kept in condition by dusting and rubbing with a soft\r\n    cloth, or a rubber of old silk; but dining-tables can only be\r\n    kept in order by hard rubbing, or rather by quick rubbing, which\r\n    warms the wood and removes all spots.\r\n\r\n    2180. Brushing clothes is a very simple but very necessary\r\n    operation. Fine cloths require to be brushed lightly, and with\r\n    rather a soft brush, except where mud is to be removed, when a\r\n    hard one is necessary, being previously beaten lightly to\r\n    dislodge the dirt. Lay the garment on a table, and brush it in\r\n    the direction of the nap. Having brushed it properly, turn the\r\n    sleeves back to the collar, so that the folds may come at the\r\n    elbow-joints; next turn the lappels or sides back over the\r\n    folded sleeves; then lay the skirts over level with the collar,\r\n    so that the crease may fall about the centre, and double one\r\n    half over the other, so as the fold comes in the centre of the\r\n    back.\r\n\r\n2181. Having got through his dirty work, the single footman has now to\r\nclean himself and prepare the breakfast. He lays the cloth on the table;\r\nover it the breakfast-cloth, and sets the breakfast things in order, and\r\nthen proceeds to wait upon his master, if he has any of the duties of a\r\nvalet to perform.\r\n\r\n2182. Where a valet is not kept, a portion of his duties falls to the\r\nfootman's share,--brushing the clothes among others. When the hat is\r\nsilk, it requires brushing every day with a soft brush; after rain, it\r\nrequires wiping the way of the nap before drying, and, when nearly dry,\r\nbrushing with the soft brush and with the hat-stick in it. If the\r\nfootman is required to perform any part of a valet's duties, he will\r\nhave to see that the housemaid lights a fire in the dressing-room in due\r\ntime; that the room is dusted and cleaned; that the washhand-ewer is\r\nfilled with soft water; and that the bath, whether hot or cold, is ready\r\nwhen required; that towels are at hand; that hair-brushes and combs are\r\nproperly cleansed, and in their places; that hot water is ready at the\r\nhour ordered; the dressing-gown and slippers in their place, the clean\r\nlinen aired, and the clothes to be worn for the day in their proper\r\nplaces. After the master has dressed, it will be the footman's duty to\r\nrestore everything to its place properly cleansed and dry, and the whole\r\nrestored to order.\r\n\r\n2183. At breakfast, when there is no butler, the footman carries up the\r\ntea-urn, and, assisted by the housemaid, he waits during breakfast.\r\nBreakfast over, he removes the tray and other things off the table,\r\nfolds up the breakfast-cloth, and sets the room in order, by sweeping\r\nup all crumbs, shaking the cloth, and laying it on the table again,\r\nmaking up the fire, and sweeping up the hearth.\r\n\r\n2184. At luncheon-time nearly the same routine is observed, except where\r\nthe footman is either out with the carriage or away on other business,\r\nwhen, in the absence of any butler, the housemaid must assist.\r\n\r\n2185. For dinner, the footman lays the cloth, taking care that the table\r\nis not too near the fire, if there is one, and that passage-room is\r\nleft. A tablecloth should be laid without a wrinkle; and this requires\r\ntwo persons: over this the slips are laid, which are usually removed\r\npreparatory to placing dessert on the table. He prepares knives, forks,\r\nand glasses, with five or six plates for each person. This done, he\r\nplaces chairs enough for the party, distributing them equally on each\r\nside of the table, and opposite to each a napkin neatly folded, within\r\nit a piece of bread or small roll, and a knife on the right side of each\r\nplate, a fork on the left, and a carving-knife and fork at the top and\r\nbottom of the table, outside the others, with the rests opposite to\r\nthem, and a gravy-spoon beside the knife. The fish-slice should be at\r\nthe top, where the lady of the house, with the assistance of the\r\ngentleman next to her, divides the fish, and the soup-ladle at the\r\nbottom: it is sometimes usual to add a dessert-knife and fork; at the\r\nsame time, on the right side also of each plate, put a wine-glass for as\r\nmany kinds of wine as it is intended to hand round, and a finger-glass\r\nor glass-cooler about four inches from the edge. The latter are\r\nfrequently put on the table with the dessert.\r\n\r\n2186. About half an hour before dinner, he rings the dinner-bell, where\r\nthat is the practice, and occupies himself with carrying up everything\r\nhe is likely to require. At the expiration of the time, having\r\ncommunicated with the cook, he rings the real dinner-bell, and proceeds\r\nto take it up with such assistance as he can obtain. Having ascertained\r\nthat all is in order, that his own dress is clean and presentable, and\r\nhis white cotton gloves are without a stain, he announces in the\r\ndrawing-room that dinner is served, and stands respectfully by the door\r\nuntil the company are seated: he places himself on the left, behind his\r\nmaster, who is to distribute the soup; where soup and fish are served\r\ntogether, his place will be at his mistress's left hand; but he must be\r\non the alert to see that whoever is assisting him, whether male or\r\nfemale, are at their posts. If any of the guests has brought his own\r\nservant with him, his place is behind his master's chair, rendering such\r\nassistance to others as he can, while attending to his master's wants\r\nthroughout the dinner, so that every guest has what he requires. This\r\nnecessitates both activity and intelligence, and should be done without\r\nbustle, without asking any questions, except where it is the custom of\r\nthe house to hand round dishes or wine, when it will be necessary to\r\nmention, in a quiet and unobtrusive manner, the dish or wine you\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n    2187. Salt-cellars should be placed on the table in number\r\n    sufficient for the guests, so that each may help themselves, or,\r\n    at least, their immediate neighbours.\r\n\r\n    DINNERS À LA RUSSE.\r\n\r\n    2188. In some houses the table is laid out with plate and glass,\r\n    and ornamented with flowers, the dessert only being placed on\r\n    the table, the dinner itself being placed on the sideboard, and\r\n    handed round in succession, in courses of soup, fish, entries,\r\n    meat, game, and sweets. This is not only elegant but economical,\r\n    as fewer dishes are required, the symmetry of the table being\r\n    made up with the ornaments and dessert. The various dishes are\r\n    also handed round when hot; but it involves additional and\r\n    superior attendance, as the wines are also handed round; and\r\n    unless the servants are very active and intelligent, many\r\n    blunders are likely to be made. (See p. 954.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n2189. While attentive to all, the footman should be obtrusive to none;\r\nhe should give nothing but on a waiter, and always hand it with the left\r\nhand and on the left side of the person he serves, and hold it so that\r\nthe guest may take it with ease. In lifting dishes from the table, he\r\nshould use both hands, and remove them with care, so that nothing is\r\nspilt on the table-cloth or on the dresses of the guests.\r\n\r\n2190. Masters as well as servants sometimes make mistakes; but it is not\r\nexpected that a servant will correct any omissions, even if he should\r\nhave time to notice them, although with the best intentions: thus it\r\nwould not be correct, for instance, if he observed that his master took\r\nwine with the ladies all round, as some gentlemen still continue to do,\r\nbut stopped at some one:--to nudge him on the shoulder and say, as was\r\ndone by the servant of a Scottish gentleman, \"What ails you at her in\r\nthe green gown?\" It will be better to leave the lady unnoticed than for\r\nthe servant thus to turn his master into ridicule.\r\n\r\n2191. During dinner each person's knife, fork, plate, and spoon should\r\nbe changed as soon as he has done with it; the vegetables and sauces\r\nbelonging to the different dishes presented without remark to the\r\nguests; and the footman should tread lightly in moving round, and, if\r\npossible, should bear in mind, if there is a wit or humorist of the\r\nparty, whose good things keep the table in a roar, that they are not\r\nexpected to reach his ears.\r\n\r\n    2192. In opening wine, let it be done quietly, and without\r\n    shaking the bottle; if crusted, let it be inclined to the\r\n    crusted side, and decanted while in that position. In opening\r\n    champagne, it is not necessary to discharge it with a pop;\r\n    properly cooled, the cork is easily extracted without an\r\n    explosion; when the cork is out, the mouth of the bottle should\r\n    be wiped with the napkin over the footman's arm.\r\n\r\n2193. At the end of the first course, notice is conveyed to the cook,\r\nwho is waiting to send up the second, which is introduced in the same\r\nway as before; the attendants who remove the fragments, carrying the\r\ndishes from the kitchen, and handing them to the footman or butler,\r\nwhose duty it is to arrange them on the table. After dinner, the\r\ndessert-glasses and wines are placed on the table by the footman, who\r\nplaces himself behind his master's chair, to supply wine and hand round\r\nthe ices and other refreshments, all other servants leaving the room.\r\n\r\n2194. As soon as the drawing-room bell rings for tea, the footman enters\r\nwith the tray, which has been previously prepared; hands the tray round\r\nto the company, with cream and sugar, the tea and coffee being generally\r\npoured out, while another attendant hands cakes, toast, or biscuits. If\r\nit is an ordinary family party, where this social meal is prepared by\r\nthe mistress, he carries the urn or kettle, as the case may be; hands\r\nround the toast, or such other eatable as may be required, removing the\r\nwhole in the same manner when tea is over.\r\n\r\n    2195. After each meal, the footman's place is in his pantry:\r\n    here perfect order should prevail--a place for everything and\r\n    everything in its place. A sink, with hot and cold water laid\r\n    on, is very desirable,--cold absolutely necessary. Wooden bowls\r\n    or tubs of sufficient capacity are required, one for hot and\r\n    another for cold water. Have the bowl three parts full of clean\r\n    hot water; in this wash all plate and plated articles which are\r\n    greasy, wiping them before cleaning with the brush.\r\n\r\n    2196. The footman in small families, where only one man is kept,\r\n    has many of the duties of the upper servants to perform as well\r\n    as his own, and more constant occupation; he will also have the\r\n    arrangement of his time more immediately under his own control,\r\n    and he will do well to reduce it to a methodical division. All\r\n    his rough work should be done before breakfast is ready, when he\r\n    must appear clean, and in a presentable state. After breakfast,\r\n    when everything belonging to his pantry is cleaned and put in\r\n    its place, the furniture in the dining and drawing rooms\r\n    requires rubbing. Towards noon, the parlour luncheon is to be\r\n    prepared; and he must be at his mistress's disposal to go out\r\n    with the carriage, or follow her if she walks out.\r\n\r\n    2197. Glass is a beautiful and most fragile article: hence it\r\n    requires great care in washing. A perfectly clean wooden bowl is\r\n    best for this operation, one for moderately hot and another for\r\n    cold water. Wash the glasses well in the first and rinse them in\r\n    the second, and turn them down on a linen cloth folded two or\r\n    three times, to drain for a few minutes. When sufficiently\r\n    drained, wipe them with a cloth and polish with a finer one,\r\n    doing so tenderly and carefully. Accidents will happen; but\r\n    nothing discredits a servant in the drawing-room more than\r\n    continual reports of breakages, which, of course, must reach\r\n    that region.\r\n\r\n    2198. Decanters and water-jugs require still more tender\r\n    treatment in cleaning, inasmuch as they are more costly to\r\n    replace. Fill them about two-thirds with hot but not boiling\r\n    water, and put in a few pieces of well-soaped brown paper; leave\r\n    them thus for two or three hours; then shake the water up and\r\n    down in the decanters; empty this out, rinse them well with\r\n    clean cold water, and put them in a rack to drain. When dry,\r\n    polish them outside and inside, as far as possible, with a fine\r\n    cloth. To remove the crust of port or other wines, add a little\r\n    muriatic acid to the water, and let it remain for some time.\r\n\r\n2199. When required to go out with the carriage, it is the footman's\r\nduty to see that it has come to the door perfectly clean, and that the\r\nglasses, and sashes, and linings, are free from dust. In receiving\r\nmessages at the carriage door, he should turn his ear to the speaker, so\r\nas to comprehend what is said, in order that he may give his directions\r\nto the coachman clearly. When the house he is to call at is reached, he\r\nshould knock, and return to the carriage for orders. In closing the door\r\nupon the family, he should see that the handle is securely turned, and\r\nthat no part of the ladies' dress is shut in.\r\n\r\n2200. It is the footman's duty to carry messages or letters for his\r\nmaster or mistress to their friends, to the post, or to the\r\ntradespeople; and nothing is more important than dispatch and exactness\r\nin doing so, although writing even the simplest message is now the\r\nordinary and very proper practice. Dean Swift, among his other quaint\r\ndirections, all of which are to be read by contraries, recommends a\r\nperusal of all such epistles, in order that you may be the more able to\r\nfulfil your duty to your master. An old lady of Forfarshire had one of\r\nthose odd old Caleb Balderston sort of servants, who construed the Dean\r\nof St. Patrick more literally. On one occasion, when dispatch was of\r\nsome importance, knowing his inquiring nature, she called her Scotch\r\nPaul Pry to her, opened the note, and read it to him herself, saying,\r\n\"Now, Andrew, you ken a' aboot it, and needna' stop to open and read it,\r\nbut just take it at once.\" Probably most of the notes you are expected\r\nto carry might, with equal harmlessness, be communicated to you; but it\r\nwill be better not to take so lively an interest in your mistress's\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n2201. Politeness and civility to visitors is one of the things masters\r\nand mistresses have a right to expect, and should exact rigorously. When\r\nvisitors present themselves, the servant charged with the duty of\r\nopening the door will open it promptly, and answer, without hesitation,\r\nif the family are \"not at home,\" or \"engaged;\" which generally means the\r\nsame thing, and might be oftener used with advantage to morals. On the\r\ncontrary, if he has no such orders, he will answer affirmatively, open\r\nthe door wide to admit them, and precede them to open the door of the\r\ndrawing-room. If the family are not there, he will place chairs for\r\nthem, open the blinds (if the room is too dark), and intimate civilly\r\nthat he goes to inform his mistress. If the lady is in her drawing-room,\r\nhe announces the name of the visitors, having previously acquainted\r\nhimself with it. In this part of his duty it is necessary to be very\r\ncareful to repeat the names correctly; mispronouncing names is very apt\r\nto give offence, and leads sometimes to other disagreeables. The writer\r\nwas once initiated into some of the secrets on the \"other side\" of a\r\nlegal affair in which he took an interest, before he could correct a\r\nmistake made by the servant in announcing him. When the visitor is\r\ndeparting, the servant should be at hand, ready, when rung for, to open\r\nthe door; he should open it with a respectful manner, and close it\r\ngently when the visitors are fairly beyond the threshold. When several\r\nvisitors arrive together, he should take care not to mix up the\r\ndifferent names together, where they belong to the same family, as Mr.,\r\nMrs., and Miss; if they are strangers, he should announce each as\r\ndistinctly as possible.\r\n\r\n2202. _Receptions and Evening Parties_.--The drawing-rooms being\r\nprepared, the card-tables laid out with cards and counters, and such\r\nother arrangements as are necessary made for the reception of the\r\ncompany, the rooms should be lighted up as the hour appointed\r\napproaches. Attendants in the drawing-room, even more than in the\r\ndining-room, should move about actively but noiselessly; no creaking of\r\nshoes, which is an abomination; watching the lights from time to time,\r\nso as to keep up their brilliancy. But even if the attendant likes a\r\ngame of cribbage or whist himself, he must not interfere in his master\r\nor mistress's game, nor even seem to take an interest in it. We once\r\nknew a lady who had a footman, and both were fond of a game of\r\ncribbage,--John in the kitchen, the lady in her drawing-room. The lady\r\nwas a giver of evening parties, where she frequently enjoyed her\r\nfavourite amusement. While handing about the tea and toast, John could\r\nnot always suppress his disgust at her mistakes. \"There is more in that\r\nhand, ma'am,\" he has been known to say; or, \"Ma'am, you forgot to count\r\nhis nob;\" in fact, he identified himself with his mistress's game, and\r\nwould have lost twenty places rather than witness a miscount. It is not\r\nnecessary to adopt his example on this point, although John had many\r\nqualities a good servant might copy with advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COACHHOUSE AND STABLES.\r\n\r\n    2203. THE HORSE is the noblest of quadrupeds, whether we view\r\n    him in his strength, his sagacity, or his beauty. He is also the\r\n    most useful to man of all the animal creation; but his delicacy\r\n    is equal to his power and usefulness. No other animal, probably,\r\n    is so dependent on man in the state of domestication to which he\r\n    has been reduced, or deteriorates so rapidly under exposure, bad\r\n    feeding, or bad grooming. It is, therefore, a point of humanity,\r\n    not to speak of its obvious impolicy, for the owner of horses to\r\n    overlook any neglect in their feeding or grooming. His interest\r\n    dictates that so valuable an animal should be well housed, well\r\n    fed, and well groomed; and he will do well to acquire so much of\r\n    stable lore as will enable him to judge of these points himself.\r\n    In a general way, where a horse's coat is habitually rough and\r\n    untidy, there is a sad want of elbow-grease in the stable. When\r\n    a horse of tolerable breeding is dull and spiritless, he is\r\n    getting ill or badly fed; and where he is observed to perspire\r\n    much in the stables, is overfed, and probably eats his litter in\r\n    addition to his regular supply of food.\r\n\r\n    2204. _Stables_.--The architectural form of the stables will be\r\n    subject to other influences than ours; we confine ourselves,\r\n    therefore, to their internal arrangements. They should be roomy\r\n    in proportion to the number of stalls; warm, with good\r\n    ventilation, and perfectly free from cold draughts; the stalls\r\n    roomy, without excess, with good and well-trapped drainage, so\r\n    as to exclude bad smells; a sound ceiling to prevent the\r\n    entrance of dust from the hayloft, which is usually above them;\r\n    and there should be plenty of light, coming, however, either\r\n    from above or behind, so as not to glare in the horse's eye.\r\n\r\n    2205. _Heat_.--The first of these objects is attained, if the\r\n    stables are kept within a degree or two of 50° in winter, and\r\n    60° in summer; although some grooms insist on a much higher\r\n    temperature, in the interests of their own labour.\r\n\r\n    2206. _Ventilation_ is usually attained by the insertion of one\r\n    or more tubes or boxes of wood or iron through the ceiling and\r\n    the roof, with a sloping covering over the opening, to keep out\r\n    rain, and valves or ventilators below to regulate the\r\n    atmosphere, with openings in the walls for the admission of\r\n    fresh air: this is still a difficulty, however; for the\r\n    effluvium of the stable is difficult to dispel, and draughts\r\n    must be avoided. This is sometimes accomplished by means of\r\n    hollow walls with gratings at the bottom outside, for the exit\r\n    of bad air, which is carried down through the hollow walls and\r\n    discharged at the bottom, while, for the admission of fresh air,\r\n    the reverse takes place: the fresh by this means gets diffused\r\n    and heated before it is discharged into the stable.\r\n\r\n    2207. _The Stalls_ should be divided by partitions of wood-work\r\n    eight or nine feet high at the head and six at the heels, and\r\n    nine feet deep, so as to separate each horse from its neighbour.\r\n    A hay-rack placed within easy reach of the horse, of wood or\r\n    iron, occupies either a corner or the whole breadth of the\r\n    stall, which should be about six feet for on ordinary-sized\r\n    horse. A manger, formerly of wood, but of late years more\r\n    generally of iron lined with enamel, occupies a corner of the\r\n    stall. The pavement of the stall should be nearly level, with a\r\n    slight incline towards the gutter, to keep the bed dry, paved\r\n    with hard Dutch brick laid on edge, or asphalte, or smithy\r\n    clinkers, or rubble-stones, laid in strong cement. In the\r\n    centre, about five feet from the wall, a grating should be\r\n    firmly fixed in the pavement, and in communication with a\r\n    well-trapped drain to carry off the water; the gutter outside\r\n    the stall should also communicate with the drains by trapped\r\n    openings. The passage between the stall and the hall should be\r\n    from five to six feet broad at least; on the wall, opposite to\r\n    each stall, pegs should be placed for receiving the harness and\r\n    other things in daily use.\r\n\r\n    2208. _A Harness-room_ is indispensable to every stable. It\r\n    should be dry and airy, and furnished with a fireplace and\r\n    boiler, both for the protection of the harness and to prepare\r\n    mashes for the horses when required. The partition-wall should\r\n    be boarded where the harness goes, with pegs to hang the various\r\n    pieces of harness on, with saddle-trees to rest the saddles on,\r\n    a cupboard for the brushes, sponges, and leathers, and a lock-up\r\n    corn-bin.\r\n\r\n    2209. _The furniture_ of a stable with coachhouse, consists of\r\n    coach-mops, jacks for raising the wheels, horse-brushes,\r\n    spoke-brushes, water-brushes, crest and bit-brushes,\r\n    dandy-brushes, currycombs, birch and heath brooms,\r\n    trimming-combs, scissors and pickers, oil-cans and brushes,\r\n    harness-brushes of three sorts, leathers, sponges for horse and\r\n    carriage, stable-forks, dung-baskets or wheelbarrow, corn-sieves\r\n    and measures, horse-cloths and stable pails, horn or glass\r\n    lanterns. Over the stables there should be accommodation for the\r\n    coachman or groom to sleep. Accidents sometimes occur, and he\r\n    should be at hand to interfere.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE COACHMAN, GROOM, AND STABLE-BOY.\r\n\r\n2210. _The Establishment_ we have in view will consist of coachman,\r\ngroom, and stable-boy, who are capable of keeping in perfect order four\r\nhorses, and perhaps the pony. Of this establishment the coachman is\r\nchief. Besides skill in driving, he should possess a good general\r\nknowledge of horses; he has usually to purchase provender, to see that\r\nthe horses are regularly fed and properly groomed, watch over their\r\ncondition, apply simple remedies to trifling ailments in the animals\r\nunder his charge, and report where he observes symptoms of more serious\r\nones which he does not understand. He has either to clean the carriage\r\nhimself, or see that the stable-boy does it properly.\r\n\r\n2211. _The Groom's_ first duties are to keep his horses in condition;\r\nbut he is sometimes expected to perform the duties of a valet, to ride\r\nout with his master, on occasions, to wait at table, and otherwise\r\nassist in the house: in these cases, he should have the means of\r\ndressing himself, and keeping his clothes entirely away from the\r\nstables. In the morning, about six o'clock, or rather before, the\r\nstables should be opened and cleaned out, and the horses fed, first by\r\ncleaning the rack and throwing in fresh hay, putting it lightly in the\r\nrack, that the horses may get it out easily; a short time afterwards\r\ntheir usual morning feed of oats should be put into the manger. While\r\nthis is going on, the stable-boy has been removing the stable-dung, and\r\nsweeping and washing out the stables, both of which should be done every\r\nday, and every corner carefully swept, in order to keep the stable sweet\r\nand clean. The real duties of the groom follow: where the horses are not\r\ntaken out for early exercise, the work of grooming immediately\r\ncommences. \"Having tied up the head,\" to use the excellent description\r\nof the process given by old Barrett, \"take a currycomb and curry him all\r\nover the body, to raise the dust, beginning first at the neck, holding\r\nthe left cheek of the headstall in the left hand, and curry him from the\r\nsetting-on of his head all over the body to the buttocks, down to the\r\npoint of the hock; then change your hands, and curry him before, on his\r\nbreast, and, laying your right arm over his back, join your right side\r\nto his left, and curry him all under the belly near the fore-bowels, and\r\nso all over from the knees and back upwards; after that, go to the far\r\nside and do that likewise. Then take a dead horse's tail, or, failing\r\nthat, a cotton dusting-cloth, and strike that away which the currycomb\r\nhath raised. Then take a round brush made of bristles, with a leathern\r\nhandle, and dress him all over, both head, body, and legs, to the very\r\nfetlocks, always cleansing the brush from the dust by rubbing it with\r\nthe currycomb. In the curry-combing process, as well as brushing, it\r\nmust be applied with mildness, especially with fine-skinned horses;\r\notherwise the tickling irritates them much. The brushing is succeeded by\r\na hair-cloth, with which rub him all over again very hard, both to take\r\naway loose hairs and lay his coat; then wash your hands in fair water,\r\nand rub him all over while they are wet, as well over the head as the\r\nbody. Lastly, take a clean cloth, and rub him all over again till he be\r\ndry; then take another hair-cloth, and rub all his legs exceeding well\r\nfrom the knees and hocks downwards to his hoofs, picking and dressing\r\nthem very carefully about the fetlocks, so as to remove all gravel and\r\ndust which will sometimes lie in the bending of the joints.\" In addition\r\nto the practice of this old writer, modern grooms add wisping, which\r\nusually follows brushing. The best wisp is made from a hayband,\r\nuntwisted, and again doubled up after being moistened with water: this\r\nis applied to every part of the body, as the brushing had been, by\r\nchanging the hands, taking care in all these operations to carry the\r\nhand in the direction of the coat. Stains on the hair are removed by\r\nsponging, or, when the coat is very dirty, by the water-brush; the whole\r\nbeing finished off by a linen or flannel cloth. The horsecloth should\r\nnow be put on by taking the cloth in both hands, with the outside next\r\nyou, and, with your right hand to the off side, throw it over his back,\r\nplacing it no farther back than will leave it straight and level, which\r\nwill be about a foot from the tail. Put the roller round, and the\r\npad-piece under it, about six or eight inches from the fore legs. The\r\nhorse's head is now loosened; he is turned about in his stall to have\r\nhis head and ears rubbed and brushed over every part, including throat,\r\nwith the dusting-cloth, finishing by \"pulling his ears,\" which all\r\nhorses seem to enjoy very much. This done, the mane and foretop should\r\nbe combed out, passing a wet sponge over them, sponging the mane on both\r\nsides, by throwing it back to the midriff, to make it lie smooth. The\r\nhorse is now returned to his headstall, his tail combed out, cleaning it\r\nof stains with a wet brush or sponge, trimming both tail and mane, and\r\nforelock when necessary, smoothing them down with a brush on which a\r\nlittle oil has been dropped.\r\n\r\n    2212. Watering usually follows dressing; but some horses refuse\r\n    their food until they have drunk: the groom should not,\r\n    therefore, lay down exclusive rules on this subject, but study\r\n    the temper and habits of his horse.\r\n\r\n    2213. _Exercise_.--All horses not in work require at least two\r\n    hours' exercise daily; and in exercising them a good groom will\r\n    put them through the paces to which they have been trained. In\r\n    the case of saddle-horses he will walk, trot, canter, and gallop\r\n    them, in order to keep them up to their work. With draught\r\n    horses they ought to be kept up to a smart walk and trot.\r\n\r\n    2214. _Feeding_ must depend on their work, but they require\r\n    feeding three times a day, with more or less corn each time,\r\n    according to their work. In the fast coaching days it was a\r\n    saying among proprietors, that \"his belly was the measure of his\r\n    food;\" but the horse's appetite is not to be taken as a\r\n    criterion of the quantity of food under any circumstances.\r\n    Horses have been known to consume 40 lbs. of hay in twenty-four\r\n    hours, whereas 16 lbs. to 18 lbs. is the utmost which should\r\n    have been given. Mr. Croall, an extensive coach proprietor in\r\n    Scotland, limited his horses to 4-1/2 lbs. cut straw, 8 lbs.\r\n    bruised oats, and 2-1/2 lbs. bruised beans, in the morning and\r\n    noon, giving them at night 25 lbs. of the following; viz., 560\r\n    lbs. steamed potatoes, 36 lbs. barley-dust, 40 lbs. cut straw,\r\n    and 6 lbs. salt, mixed up together: under this the horses did\r\n    their work well. The ordinary measure given a horse is a peck of\r\n    oats, about 40 lbs. to the bushel, twice a day, a third feed and\r\n    a rack-full of hay, which may be about 15 lbs. or 18 lbs., when\r\n    he is in full work.\r\n\r\n    2215. You cannot take up a paper without having the question\r\n    put, \"Do you bruise your oats?\" Well, that depends on\r\n    circumstances: a fresh young horse can bruise its own oats when\r\n    it can get them; but aged horses, after a time, lose the power\r\n    of masticating and bruising them, and bolt them whole; thus much\r\n    impeding the work of digestion. For an old horse, then, bruise\r\n    the oats; for a young one it does no harm and little good. Oats\r\n    should be bright and dry, and not too new. Where they are new,\r\n    sprinkle them with salt and water; otherwise, they overload the\r\n    horse's stomach. Chopped straw mixed with oats, in the\r\n    proportion of a third of straw or hay, is a good food for horses\r\n    in full work; and carrots, of which horses are remarkably fond,\r\n    have a perceptible effect in a short time on the gloss of the\r\n    coat.\r\n\r\n    2216. The water given to a horse merits some attention; it\r\n    should not be too cold; hard water is not to be recommended;\r\n    stagnant or muddy water is positively injurious; river water is\r\n    the best for all purposes; and anything is preferable to spring\r\n    water, which should be exposed to the sun in summer for an hour\r\n    or two, and stirred up before using it; a handful of oatmeal\r\n    thrown into the pail will much improve its quality.\r\n\r\n    2217. _Shoeing_.--A horse should not be sent on a journey or any\r\n    other hard work immediately after new shoeing;--the stiffness\r\n    incidental to new shoes is not unlikely to bring him down. A\r\n    day's rest, with reasonable exercise, will not be thrown away\r\n    after this operation. On reaching home very hot, the groom\r\n    should walk him about for a few minutes; this done, he should\r\n    take off the moisture with the scraper, and afterwards wisp him\r\n    over with a handful of straw and a flannel cloth: if the cloth\r\n    is dipped in some spirit, all the better. He should wash, pick,\r\n    and wipe dry the legs and feet, take off the bridle and crupper,\r\n    and fasten it to the rack, then the girths, and put a wisp of\r\n    straw under the saddle. When sufficiently cool, the horse should\r\n    have some hay given him, and then a feed of oats: if he refuse\r\n    the latter, offer him a little wet bran, or a handful of oatmeal\r\n    in tepid water. When he has been fed, he should be thoroughly\r\n    cleaned, and his body-clothes put on, and, if very much harassed\r\n    with fatigue, a little good ale or wine will be well bestowed on\r\n    a valuable horse, adding plenty of fresh litter under the belly.\r\n\r\n    2218. _Bridles_.--Every time a horse is unbridled, the bit\r\n    should be carefully washed and dried, and the leather wiped, to\r\n    keep them sweet, as well as the girths and saddle, the latter\r\n    being carefully dried and beaten with a switch before it is\r\n    again put on. In washing a horse's feet after a day's work, the\r\n    master should insist upon the legs and feet being washed\r\n    thoroughly with a sponge until the water flows over them, and\r\n    then rubbed with a brush till quite dry.\r\n\r\n    2219. _Harness_, if not carefully preserved, very soon gets a\r\n    shabby tarnished appearance. Where the coachman has a proper\r\n    harness-room and sufficient assistance, this is inexcusable and\r\n    easily prevented. The harness-room should have a wooden lining\r\n    all round, and be perfectly dry and well ventilated. Around the\r\n    walls, hooks and pegs should be placed, for the several pieces\r\n    of harness, at such a height as to prevent their touching the\r\n    ground; and every part of the harness should have its peg or\r\n    hook,--one for the halters, another for the reins, and others\r\n    for snaffles and other bits and metal-work; and either a wooden\r\n    horse or saddle-trees for the saddles and pads. All these parts\r\n    should be dry, clean, and shining. This is only to be done by\r\n    careful cleaning and polishing, and the use of several requisite\r\n    pastes. The metallic parts, when white, should be cleaned by a\r\n    soft brush and plate-powder; the copper and brass parts\r\n    burnished with rottenstone-powder and oil,--steel with\r\n    emery-powder; both made into a paste with a little oil.\r\n\r\n    2220. An excellent paste for polishing harness and the\r\n    leather-work of carriages, is made by melting 8 lbs. of yellow\r\n    wax, stirring it till completely dissolved. Into this pour 1 lb.\r\n    of litharge of the shops, which has been pounded up with water,\r\n    and dried and sifted through a sieve, leaving the two, when\r\n    mixed, to simmer on the fire, stirring them continually till all\r\n    is melted. When it is a little cool, mix this with 1-1/4 lb. of\r\n    good ivory-black; place this again on the fire, and stir till it\r\n    boils anew, and suffer it to cool. When cooled a little, add\r\n    distilled turpentine till it has the consistence of a thickish\r\n    paste, scenting it with any essence at hand, thinning it when\r\n    necessary from time to time, by adding distilled turpentine.\r\n\r\n    2221. When the leather is old and greasy, it should be cleaned\r\n    before applying this polish, with a brush wetted in a weak\r\n    solution of potass and water, washing afterwards with soft river\r\n    water, and drying thoroughly. If the leather is not black, one\r\n    or two coats of black ink may be given before applying the\r\n    polish. When quite dry, the varnish should be laid on with a\r\n    soft shoe-brush, using also a soft brush to polish the leather.\r\n\r\n    2222. When the leather is very old, it may be softened with\r\n    fish-oil, and, after putting on the ink, a sponge charged with\r\n    distilled turpentine passed over, to scour the surface of the\r\n    leather, which should be polished as above.\r\n\r\n    2223. _For fawn or yellow-coloured leather_, take a quart of\r\n    skimmed milk, pour into it 1 oz. of sulphuric acid, and, when\r\n    cold, add to it 4 oz. of hydrochloric acid, shaking the bottle\r\n    gently until it ceases to emit white vapours; separate the\r\n    coagulated from the liquid part, by straining through a sieve,\r\n    and store it away till required. In applying it, clean the\r\n    leather by a weak solution of oxalic acid, washing it off\r\n    immediately, and apply the composition when dry with a sponge.\r\n\r\n    2224. _Wheel-grease_ is usually purchased at the shops; but a\r\n    good paste is made as follows:--Melt 80 parts of grease, and\r\n    stir into it, mixing it thoroughly and smoothly, 20 parts of\r\n    fine black-lead in powder, and store away in a tin box for use.\r\n    This grease is used in the mint at Paris, and is highly\r\n    approved.\r\n\r\n    2225. _Carriages_ in an endless variety of shapes and names are\r\n    continually making their appearance; but the hackney cab or\r\n    clarence seems most in request for light carriages; the family\r\n    carriage of the day being a modified form of the clarence\r\n    adapted for family use. The carriage is a valuable piece of\r\n    furniture, requiring all the care of the most delicate\r\n    upholstery, with the additional disadvantage of continual\r\n    exposure to the weather and to the muddy streets.\r\n\r\n2216. It requires, therefore, to be carefully cleaned before putting\r\naway, and a coach-house perfectly dry and well ventilated, for the\r\nwood-work swells with moisture; it shrinks also with heat, unless the\r\ntimber has undergone a long course of seasoning: it should also have a\r\ndry floor, a boarded one being recommended. It must be removed from the\r\nammoniacal influence of the stables, from open drains and cesspools, and\r\nother gaseous influences likely to affect the paint and varnish. When\r\nthe carriage returns home, it should be carefully washed and dried, and\r\nthat, if possible, before the mud has time to dry on it. This is done by\r\nfirst well slushing it with clean water, so as to wash away all\r\nparticles of sand, having first closed the sashes to avoid wetting the\r\nlinings. The body is then gone carefully over with a soft mop, using\r\nplenty of clean water, and penetrating into every corner of the carved\r\nwork, so that not an atom of dirt remains; the body of the carriage is\r\nthen raised by placing the jack under the axletree and raising it so\r\nthat the wheel turns freely; this is now thoroughly washed with the mop\r\nuntil the dirt is removed, using a water-brush for corners where the mop\r\ndoes not penetrate. Every particle of mud and sand removed by the mop,\r\nand afterwards with a wet sponge, the carriage is wiped dry, and, as\r\nsoon after as possible, the varnish is carefully polished with soft\r\nleather, using a little sweet oil for the leather parts, and even for\r\nthe panels, so as to check any tendency of the varnish to crack. Stains\r\nare removed by rubbing them with the leather and sweet oil; if that\r\nfails, a little Tripoli powder mixed with the oil will be more\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n2227. In preparing the carriage for use, the whole body should be rubbed\r\nover with a clean leather and carefully polished, the iron-work and\r\njoints oiled, the plated and brass-work occasionally cleaned,--the one\r\nwith plate-powder, or with well-washed whiting mixed with sweet oil, and\r\nleather kept for the purpose,--the other with rottenstone mixed with a\r\nlittle oil, and applied without too much rubbing, until the paste is\r\nremoved; but, if rubbed every day with the leather, little more will be\r\nrequired to keep it untarnished. The linings require careful brushing\r\nevery day, the cushions being taken out and beaten, and the glass sashes\r\nshould always be bright and clean. The wheel-tires and axletree are\r\ncarefully seen to, and greased when required, the bolts and nuts\r\ntightened, and all the parts likely to get out of order overhauled.\r\n\r\n2228. These duties, however, are only incidental to the coachman's\r\noffice, which is to drive; and much of the enjoyment of those in the\r\ncarriage depends on his proficiency in his art,--much also of the wear\r\nof the carriage and horses. He should have sufficient knowledge of the\r\nconstruction of the carriage to know when it is out of order,--to know,\r\nalso, the pace at which he can go over the road he has under him,\r\nwithout risking the springs, and without shaking those he is driving too\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n2229. Having, with or without the help of the groom or stable-boy, put\r\nhis horses to the carriage, and satisfied himself, by walking round\r\nthem, that everything is properly arranged, the coachman proceeds to the\r\noff-side of the carriage, takes the reins from the back of the horses,\r\nwhere they were thrown, buckles them together, and, placing his foot on\r\nthe step, ascends to his box, having his horses now entirely under\r\ncontrol. In ordinary circumstances, he is not expected to descend, for\r\nwhere no footman accompanies the carriage, the doors are usually so\r\narranged that even a lady may let herself out, if she wishes it, from\r\nthe inside. The coachman's duties are to avoid everything approaching an\r\naccident, and all his attention is required to guide his horses.\r\n\r\n    2230. The pace at which he drives will depend upon his\r\n    orders,--in all probability a moderate pace of seven or eight\r\n    miles an hour; less speed is injurious to the horses, getting\r\n    them into lazy and sluggish habits; for it is wonderful how soon\r\n    these are acquired by some horses. The writer was once employed\r\n    to purchase a horse for a country friend, and he picked a very\r\n    handsome gelding out of Collins's stables, which seemed to\r\n    answer to his friend's wants. It was duly committed to the\r\n    coachman who was to drive it, after some very successful trials\r\n    in harness and out of it, and seemed likely to give great\r\n    satisfaction. After a time, the friend got tired of his\r\n    carriage, and gave it up; as the easiest mode of getting rid of\r\n    the horse, it was sent up to the writer's stables,--a present.\r\n    Only twelve months had elapsed; the horse was as handsome as\r\n    ever, with plenty of flesh, and a sleek glossy coat, and he was\r\n    thankfully enough received; but, on trial, it was found that a\r\n    stupid coachman, who was imbued with one of their old maxims,\r\n    that \"it's the pace that kills,\" had driven the horse, capable\r\n    of doing his nine miles an hour with ease, at a jog-trot of four\r\n    miles, or four and a half; and now, no persuasion of the whip\r\n    could get more out of him. After many unsuccessful efforts to\r\n    bring him back to his pace, in one of which a break-down\r\n    occurred, under the hands of a professional trainer, he was sent\r\n    to the hammer, and sold for a sum that did not pay for the\r\n    attempt to break him in. This maxim, therefore, \"that it's the\r\n    pace that kills,\" is altogether fallacious in the moderate sense\r\n    in which we are viewing it. In the old coaching days, indeed,\r\n    when the Shrewsbury \"Wonder\" drove into the inn yard while the\r\n    clock was striking, week after week and mouth after month, with\r\n    unerring regularity, twenty-seven hours to a hundred and\r\n    sixty-two miles; when the \"Quicksilver\" mail was timed to eleven\r\n    miles an hour between London and Plymouth, with a fine of £5 to\r\n    the driver if behind time; when the Brighton \"Age,\" \"tool'd\" and\r\n    horsed by the late Mr. Stevenson, used to dash round the square\r\n    as the fifth hour was striking, having stopped at the half-way\r\n    house while his servant handed a sandwich and a glass of sherry\r\n    to his passengers,--then the pace was indeed \"killing.\" But the\r\n    truth is, horses that are driven at a jog-trot pace lose that\r\n    _élan_ with which a good driver can inspire them, and they are\r\n    left to do their work by mere weight and muscle; therefore,\r\n    unless he has contrary orders, a good driver will choose a smart\r\n    pace, but not enough to make his horses perspire: on level roads\r\n    this should never be seen.\r\n\r\n    2231. In choosing his horses, every master will see that they\r\n    are properly paired,--that their paces are about equal. When\r\n    their habits differ, it is the coachman's duty to discover how\r\n    he can, with least annoyance to the horses, get that pace out of\r\n    them. Some horses have been accustomed to be driven on the\r\n    check, and the curb irritates them; others, with harder mouths,\r\n    cannot be controlled with the slight leverage this affords; he\r\n    must, therefore, accommodate the horses as he best can. The\r\n    reins should always be held so that the horses are \"in hand;\"\r\n    but he is a very bad driver who always drives with a tight rein;\r\n    the pain to the horse is intolerable, and causes him to rear and\r\n    plunge, and finally break sway, if he can. He is also a bad\r\n    driver when the reins are always slack; the horse then feels\r\n    abandoned to himself; he is neither directed nor supported, and\r\n    if no accident occurs, it is great good luck.\r\n\r\n2232. The true coachman's hands are so delicate and gentle, that the\r\nmere weight of the reins is felt on the bit, and the directions are\r\nindicated by a turn of the wrist rather than by a pull; the horses are\r\nguided and encouraged, and only pulled up when they exceed their\r\nintended pace, or in the event of a stumble; for there is a strong\r\nthough gentle hand on the reins.\r\n\r\n2233. _The Whip_, in the hands of a good driver, and with well-bred\r\ncattle, is there, more as a precaution than a \"tool\" for frequent use;\r\nif he uses it, it is to encourage, by stroking the flanks; except,\r\nindeed, he has to punish some waywardness of temper, and then he does it\r\neffectually, taking care, however, that it is done on the flank, where\r\nthere is no very tender part, never on the crupper. In driving, the\r\ncoachman should never give way to temper. How often do we see horses\r\nstumble from being conducted, or at least \"allowed,\" to go over bad\r\nground by some careless driver, who immediately wreaks that vengeance on\r\nthe poor horse which might, with much more justice, be applied to his\r\nown brutal shoulders. The whip is of course useful, and even necessary,\r\nbut should be rarely used, except to encourage and excite the horses.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE VALET.\r\n\r\n2234. _Attendants on the Person_.-\"No man is a hero to his valet,\" saith\r\nthe proverb; and the corollary may run, \"No lady is a heroine to her\r\nmaid.\" The infirmities of humanity are, perhaps, too numerous and too\r\nequally distributed to stand the severe microscopic tests which\r\nattendants on the person have opportunities of applying. The valet and\r\nwaiting-maid are placed near the persons of the master and mistress,\r\nreceiving orders only from them, dressing them, accompanying them in all\r\ntheir journeys, the confidants and agents of their most unguarded\r\nmoments, of their most secret habits, and of course subject to their\r\ncommands,--even to their caprices; they themselves being subject to\r\nerring judgment, aggravated by an imperfect education. All that can be\r\nexpected from such servants is polite manners, modest demeanour, and a\r\nrespectful reserve, which are indispensable. To these, good sense, good\r\ntemper, some self-denial, and consideration for the feelings of others,\r\nwhether above or below them in the social scale, will be useful\r\nqualifications. Their duty leads them to wait on those who are, from\r\nsheer wealth, station, and education, more polished, and consequently\r\nmore susceptible of annoyance; and any vulgar familiarity of manner is\r\nopposed to all their notions of self-respect. Quiet unobtrusive manners,\r\ntherefore, and a delicate reserve in speaking of their employers, either\r\nin praise or blame, is as essential in their absence, as good manners\r\nand respectful conduct in their presence.\r\n\r\n2235. Some of the duties of the valet we have just hinted at in treating\r\nof the duties of the footman in a small family. His day commences by\r\nseeing that his master's dressing-room is in order; that the housemaid\r\nhas swept and dusted it properly; that the fire is lighted and burns\r\ncheerfully; and some time before his master is expected, he will do well\r\nto throw up the sash to admit fresh air, closing it, however, in time to\r\nrecover the temperature which he knows his master prefers. It is now his\r\nduty to place the body-linen on the horse before the fire, to be aired\r\nproperly; to lay the trousers intended to be worn, carefully brushed and\r\ncleaned, on the back of his master's chair; while the coat and\r\nwaistcoat, carefully brushed and folded, and the collar cleaned, are\r\nlaid in their place ready to put on when required. All the articles of\r\nthe toilet should be in their places, the razors properly set and\r\nstropped, and hot water ready for use.\r\n\r\n2236. Gentlemen generally prefer performing the operation of shaving\r\nthemselves, but a valet should be prepared to do it if required; and he\r\nshould, besides, be a good hairdresser. Shaving over, he has to brush\r\nthe hair, beard, and moustache, where that appendage is encouraged,\r\narranging the whole simply and gracefully, according to the age and\r\nstyle of countenance. Every fortnight, or three weeks at the utmost, the\r\nhair should be cut, and the points of the whiskers trimmed as often as\r\nrequired. A good valet will now present the various articles of the\r\ntoilet as they are wanted; afterwards, the body-linen, neck-tie, which\r\nhe will put on, if required, and, afterwards, waistcoat, coat, and\r\nboots, in suitable order, and carefully brushed and polished.\r\n\r\n2237. Having thus seen his master dressed, if he is about to go out, the\r\nvalet will hand him his cane, gloves, and hat, the latter well brushed\r\non the outside with a soft brush, and wiped inside with a clean\r\nhandkerchief, respectfully attend him to the door, and open it for him,\r\nand receive his last orders for the day.\r\n\r\n2238. He now proceeds to put everything in order in the dressing-room,\r\ncleans the combs and brushes, and brushes and folds up any clothes that\r\nmay be left about the room, and puts them away in the drawers.\r\n\r\n2239. Gentlemen are sometimes indifferent as to their clothes and\r\nappearance; it is the valet's duty, in this case, where his master\r\npermits it, to select from the wardrobe such things as are suitable for\r\nthe occasion, so that he may appear with scrupulous neatness and\r\ncleanliness; that his linen and neck-tie, where that is white or\r\ncoloured, are unsoiled; and where he is not accustomed to change them\r\nevery day, that the cravat is turned, and even ironed, to remove the\r\ncrease of the previous fold. The coat collar,--which where the hair is\r\noily and worn long, is apt to get greasy--should also be examined; a\r\ncareful valet will correct this by removing the spots day by day as they\r\nappear, first by moistening the grease-spots with a little rectified\r\nspirits of wine or spirits of hartshorn, which has a renovating effect,\r\nand the smell of which soon disappears. The grease is dissolved and\r\nremoved by gentle scraping. The grease removed, add a little more of the\r\nspirit, and rub with a piece of clean cloth; finish by adding a few\r\ndrops more; rub it with the palm of the hand, in the direction of the\r\ngrain of the cloth, and it will be clean and glossy as the rest of the\r\ngarment.\r\n\r\n    2240. Polish for the boots is an important matter to the valet,\r\n    and not always to be obtained good by purchase; never so good,\r\n    perhaps, as he can make for himself after the following\r\n    recipes:--Take of ivory-black and treacle each 4 oz., sulphuric\r\n    acid 1 oz., best olive-oil 2 spoonfuls, best white-wine vinegar\r\n    3 half-pints: mix the ivory-black and treacle well in an earthen\r\n    jar; then add the sulphuric acid, continuing to stir the\r\n    mixture; next pour in the oil; and, lastly, add the vinegar,\r\n    stirring it in by degrees, until thoroughly incorporated.\r\n\r\n    241. Another polish is made by mixing 1 oz. each of pounded\r\n    galls and logwood-chips, and 3 lbs. of red French vine\r\n    (ordinaire). Boil together till the liquid is reduced to half\r\n    the quantity, and pour it off through a strainer. Now take 1/2\r\n    lb. each of pounded gum-arabic and lump-sugar, 1 oz. of green\r\n    copperas, and 3 lbs. of brandy. Dissolve the gum-arabic in the\r\n    preceding decoction, and add the sugar and copperas: when all is\r\n    dissolved and mixed together, stir in the brandy, mixing it\r\n    smoothly. This mixture will yield 5 or 6 lbs. of a very superior\r\n    polishing paste for boots and shoes.\r\n\r\n2242. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to add, that having discharged all the\r\ncommissions intrusted to him by his master, such as conveying notes or\r\nmessages to friends, or the tradesmen, all of which he should punctually\r\nand promptly attend to, it is his duty to be in waiting when his master\r\nreturns home to dress for dinner, or for any other occasion, and to have\r\nall things prepared for this second dressing. Previous to this, he\r\nbrings under his notice the cards of visitors who may have called,\r\ndelivers the messages be may have received for him, and otherwise\r\nacquits himself of the morning's commissions, and receives his orders\r\nfor the remainder of the day. The routine of his evening duty is to have\r\nthe dressing-room and study, where there is a separate one, arranged\r\ncomfortably for his master, the fires lighted, candles prepared,\r\ndressing-gown and slippers in their place, and aired, and everything in\r\norder that is required for his master's comforts.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEMALE DOMESTICS.\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE LADY'S-MAID.\r\n\r\n2243. The duties of a lady's-maid are more numerous, and perhaps more\r\nonerous, than those of the valet; for while the latter is aided by the\r\ntailor, the hatter, the linen-draper, and the perfumer, the lady's-maid\r\nhas to originate many parts of the mistress's dress herself: she should,\r\nindeed, be a tolerably expert milliner and dressmaker, a good\r\nhairdresser, and possess some chemical knowledge of the cosmetics with\r\nwhich the toilet-table is supplied, in order to use them with safety and\r\neffect. Her first duty in the morning, after having performed her own\r\ntoilet, is to examine the clothes put off by her mistress the evening\r\nbefore, either to put them away, or to see that they are all in order to\r\nput on again. During the winter, and in wet weather, the dresses should\r\nbe carefully examined, and the mud removed. Dresses of tweed, and other\r\nwoollen materials, may be laid out on a table and brushed all over; but\r\nin general, even in woollen fabrics, the lightness of the tissues\r\nrenders brushing unsuitable to dresses, and it is better to remove the\r\ndust from the folds by beating them lightly with a handkerchief or thin\r\ncloth. Silk dresses should never be brushed, but rubbed with a piece of\r\nmerino, or other soft material, of a similar colour, kept for the\r\npurpose. Summer dresses of barège, muslin, mohair, and other light\r\nmaterials, simply require shaking; but if the muslin be tumbled, it must\r\nbe ironed afterwards. If the dresses require slight repair, it should be\r\ndone at once: \"a stitch in time saves nine.\"\r\n\r\n    2244. The bonnet should be dusted with a light feather plume, in\r\n    order to remove every particle of dust; but this has probably\r\n    been done, as it ought to have been, the night before. Velvet\r\n    bonnets, and other velvet articles of dress, should be cleaned\r\n    with a soft brush. If the flowers with which the bonnet is\r\n    decorated have been crushed or displaced, or the leaves tumbled,\r\n    they should be raised and readjusted by means of flower-pliers.\r\n    If feathers have suffered from damp, they should be held near\r\n    the fire for a few minutes, and restored to their natural state\r\n    by the hand or a soft brush.\r\n\r\n    2245. _The Chausserie_, or foot-gear of a lady, is one of the\r\n    few things left to mark her station, and requires special care.\r\n    Satin boots or shoes should be dusted with a soft brush, or\r\n    wiped with a cloth. Kid or varnished leather should have the mud\r\n    wiped off with a sponge charged with milk, which preserves its\r\n    softness and polish. The following is also an excellent polish\r\n    for applying to ladies' boots, instead of blacking them:--Mix\r\n    equal proportions of sweet-oil, vinegar, and treacle, with 1 oz.\r\n    of lamp-black. When all the ingredients are thoroughly\r\n    incorporated, rub the mixture on the boots with the palm of the\r\n    hand, and put them in a cool place to dry. Ladies' blacking,\r\n    which may be purchased in 6d, and 1s. bottles, is also very much\r\n    used for patent leather and kid boots, particularly when they\r\n    are a little worn. This blacking is merely applied with a piece\r\n    of sponge, and the boots should not be put on until the blacking\r\n    is dry und hardened.\r\n\r\n2246. These various preliminary offices performed, the lady's-maid\r\nshould prepare for dressing her mistress, arranging her dressing-room,\r\ntoilet-table, and linen, according to her mistress's wishes and habits.\r\nThe details of dressing we need not touch upon,--every lady has her own\r\nmode of doing so; but the maid should move about quietly, perform any\r\noffices about her mistress's person, as lacing stays, gently, and adjust\r\nher linen smoothly.\r\n\r\n2247. Having prepared the dressing-room by lighting the fire, sweeping\r\nthe hearth, and made everything ready for dressing her mistress, placed\r\nher linen before the fire to air, and laid out the various articles of\r\ndress she is to wear, which will probably have been arranged the\r\nprevious evening, the lady's-maid is prepared for the morning's duties.\r\n\r\n2248. _Hairdressing_ is the most important part of the lady's-maid's\r\noffice. If ringlets are worn, remove the curl-papers, and, after\r\nthoroughly brushing the back hair both above and below, dress it\r\naccording to the prevailing fashion. If bandeaux are worn, the hair is\r\nthoroughly brushed and frizzed outside and inside, folding the hair back\r\nround the head, brushing it perfectly smooth, giving it a glossy\r\nappearance by the use of pomades, or oil, applied by the palm of the\r\nhand, smoothing it down with a small brush dipped in bandoline. Double\r\nbandeaux are formed by bringing most of the hair forward, and rolling it\r\nover frizettes made of hair the same colour as that of the wearer: it is\r\nfinished behind by plaiting the hair, and arranging it in such a manner\r\nas to look well with the head-dress.\r\n\r\n2249. Lessons in hairdressing may be obtained, and at not an\r\nunreasonable charge. If a lady's-maid can afford it, we would advise her\r\nto initiate herself in the mysteries of hairdressing before entering on\r\nher duties. If a mistress finds her maid handy, and willing to learn,\r\nshe will not mind the expense of a few lessons, which are almost\r\nnecessary, as the fashion and mode of dressing the hair is so\r\ncontinually changing. Brushes and combs should be kept scrupulously\r\nclean, by washing them about twice a week: to do this oftener spoils the\r\nbrushes, as very frequent washing makes them so very soft.\r\n\r\nTo wash Brushes.\r\n\r\n2250. Dissolve a piece of soda in some hot water, allowing a piece the\r\nsize of a walnut to a quart of water. Put the water into a basin, and,\r\nafter combing out the hair from the brushes, dip them, bristles\r\ndownwards, into the water and out again, keeping the backs and handles\r\nas free from the water as possible. Repeat this until the bristles look\r\nclean; then rinse the brushes in a little cold water; shake them well,\r\nand wipe the handles and backs with a towel, _but not the bristles_, and\r\nset the brushes to dry in the sun, or near the fire; but take care not\r\nto put them too close to it. Wiping the bristles of a brush makes them\r\nsoft, as does also the use of soap.\r\n\r\nTo clean Combs.\r\n\r\n2251. If it can be avoided, never wash combs, as the water often makes\r\nthe teeth split, and the tortoiseshell or horn of which they are made,\r\nrough. Small brushes, manufactured purposely for cleaning combs, may be\r\npurchased at a trifling cost: with this the comb should be well brushed,\r\nand afterwards wiped with a cloth or towel.\r\n\r\nA good Wash for the Hair.\r\n\r\n2252. INGREDIENTS.--1 pennyworth of borax, 1/2 pint of olive-oil, 1 pint\r\nof boiling water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Pour the boiling water over the borax and oil; let it cool; then\r\nput the mixture into a bottle. Shake it before using, and apply it with\r\na flannel. Camphor and borax, dissolved in boiling water and left to\r\ncool, make a very good wash for the hair; as also does rosemary-water\r\nmixed with a little borax. After using any of these washes, when the\r\nhair becomes thoroughly dry, a little pomatum or oil should be rubbed\r\nin, to make it smooth and glossy.\r\n\r\nTo make Pomade for the Hair.\r\n\r\n2253. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 lb. of lard, 2 pennyworth of castor-oil; scent.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Let the lard be unsalted; beat it up well; then add the\r\ncastor-oil, and mix thoroughly together with a knife, adding a few drops\r\nof any scent that may be preferred. Put the pomatum into pots, which\r\nkeep well covered to prevent it turning rancid.\r\n\r\nAnother Recipe for Pomatum.\r\n\r\n2254. INGREDIENTS.--8 oz. of olive-oil, 1 oz. of spermaceti, 3\r\npennyworth of essential oil of almonds, 3 pennyworth of essence of\r\nlemon.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix these ingredients together, and store away in jars for use.\r\n\r\nTo make Bandoline.\r\n\r\n2555. INGREDIENTS.--1 oz. of gum-tragacanth, 1/4 pint of cold water, 3\r\npennyworth of essence of almonds, 2 teaspoonfuls of old rum.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the gum-tragacanth into a wide-mouthed bottle with the cold\r\nwater; let it stand till dissolved, then stir into it the essence of\r\nalmonds; let it remain for an hour or two, when pour the rum on the top.\r\nThis should make the stock bottle, and when any is required for use, it\r\nis merely necessary to dilute it with a little cold water until the\r\ndesired consistency is obtained, and to keep it in a small bottle, well\r\ncorked, for use. This bandoline, instead of injuring the hair, as many\r\nother kinds often do, improves it, by increasing its growth, and making\r\nit always smooth and glossy.\r\n\r\nAn excellent Pomatum.\r\n\r\n2256. INGREDIENTS.--1-1/2 lb. of lard, 1/2 pint of olive-oil, 1/2 pint\r\nof castor-oil, 4 oz. of spermaceti, bergamot, or any other scent;\r\nelder-flower water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Wash the lard well in the elder-flower water; drain, and beat\r\nit to a cream. Mix the two oils together, and heat them sufficiently to\r\ndissolve the spermaceti, which should be beaten fine in a mortar. Mix\r\nall these ingredients together with the brandy and whatever kind of\r\nscent may be preferred; and whilst warm pour into glass bottles for use,\r\nkeeping them well corked. The best way to liquefy the pomatum is to set\r\nthe bottle in a saucepan of warm water. It will remain good for many\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nTo promote the Growth of Hair.\r\n\r\n2257. INGREDIENTS.--Equal quantities of olive-oil and spirit of\r\nrosemary; a few drops of oil of nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the ingredients together, rub the roots of the hair every\r\nnight with a little of this liniment, and the growth of it will very\r\nsoon sensibly increase.\r\n\r\n    2258. Our further remarks on dressing must be confined to some\r\n    general advice. In putting on a band, see that it is laid quite\r\n    flat, and is drawn tightly round the waist before it is pinned\r\n    in front; that the pin is a strong one, and that it is secured\r\n    to the stays, so as not to slip up or down, or crease in the\r\n    folds. Arrange the folds of the dress over the crinoline\r\n    petticoats; if the dress fastens behind, put a small pin in the\r\n    slit to prevent it from opening. See that the sleeves fall well\r\n    over the arms. If it is finished with a jacket, or other upper\r\n    dress, see that it fits smoothly under the arms; pull out the\r\n    flounces, and spread out the petticoat at the bottom with the\r\n    hands, so that it falls in graceful folds. In arranging the\r\n    petticoat itself, a careful lady's-maid will see that this is\r\n    firmly fastened round the waist.\r\n\r\n    2259. Where sashes are worn, pin the bows securely on the inside\r\n    with a pin, so as not to be visible; then raise the bow with the\r\n    fingers. The collar is arranged and carefully adjusted with\r\n    brooch or bow in the centre.\r\n\r\n2260. Having dressed her mistress for breakfast, and breakfasted\r\nherself, the further duties of the lady's-maid will depend altogether\r\nupon the habits of the family, in which hardly two will probably agree.\r\nWhere the duties are entirely confined to attendance on her mistress, it\r\nis probable that the bedroom and dressing-room will be committed to her\r\ncare; that, the housemaid will rarely enter, except for the weekly or\r\nother periodical cleaning; she will, therefore, have to make her\r\nmistress's bed, and keep it in order; and as her duties are light and\r\neasy, there can be no allowance made for the slightest approach to\r\nuncleanliness or want of order. Every morning, immediately after her\r\nmistress has left it, and while breakfast is on, she should throw the\r\nbed open, by taking off the clothes; open the windows (except in rainy\r\nweather), and leave the room to air for half an hour. After breakfast,\r\nexcept her attendance on her mistress prevents it, if the rooms are\r\ncarpeted, she should sweep them carefully, having previously strewed the\r\nroom with moist tea-leaves, dusting every table and chair, taking care\r\nto penetrate to every corner, and moving every article of furniture that\r\nis portable. This done satisfactorily, and having cleaned the\r\ndressing-glass, polished up the furniture and the ornaments, and made\r\nthe glass jug and basin clean and bright, emptied all slops, emptied the\r\nwater-jugs and filled them with fresh water, and arranged the rooms, the\r\ndressing-room is ready for the mistress when she thinks proper to\r\nappear.\r\n\r\n2261. The dressing-room thoroughly in order, the same thing is to be\r\ndone in the bedroom, in which she will probably be assisted by the\r\nhousemaid to make the bed and empty the slops. In making the bed, she\r\nwill study her lady's wishes, whether it is to be hard or soft, sloping\r\nor straight, and see that it is done accordingly.\r\n\r\n2262. Having swept the bedroom with equal care, dusted the tables and\r\nchairs, chimney-ornaments, and put away all articles of dress left from\r\nyesterday, and cleaned and put away any articles of jewellery, her next\r\ncare is to see, before her mistress goes out, what requires replacing in\r\nher department, and furnish her with a list of them, that she may use\r\nher discretion about ordering them. All this done, she may settle\r\nherself down to any work on which she is engaged. This will consist\r\nchiefly in mending; which is first to be seen to; everything, except\r\nstockings, being mended before washing. Plain work will probably be one\r\nof the lady's-maid's chief employments.\r\n\r\n    2263. A waiting-maid, who wishes to make herself useful, will\r\n    study the fashion-books with attention, so as to be able to aid\r\n    her mistress's judgment in dressing, according to the prevailing\r\n    fashion, with such modifications as her style of countenance\r\n    requires. She will also, if she has her mistress's interest at\r\n    heart, employ her spare time in repairing and making up dresses\r\n    which have served one purpose, to serve another also, or turning\r\n    many things, unfitted for her mistress to use, for the younger\r\n    branches of the family. The lady's-maid may thus render herself\r\n    invaluable to her mistress, and increase her own happiness in so\r\n    doing. The exigencies of fashion and luxury are such, that all\r\n    ladies, except those of the very highest rank, will consider\r\n    themselves fortunate in having about them a thoughtful person,\r\n    capable of diverting their finery to a useful purpose.\r\n\r\n2264. Among other duties, the lady's-maid should understand the various\r\nprocesses for washing, and cleaning, and repairing laces; edging of\r\ncollars; removing stains and grease-spots from dresses, and similar\r\nprocesses, for which the following recipes will be found very useful. In\r\nwashing--\r\n\r\n    2265. _Blonde_, fine toilet-soap is used; the blonde is soaped\r\n    over very slightly, and washed in water in which a little\r\n    fig-blue is dissolved, rubbing it very gently; when clean, dry\r\n    it. Dip it afterwards in very thin gum-water, dry it again in\r\n    linen, spread it out as flat as it will lie, and iron it. Where\r\n    the blonde is of better quality, and wider, it may be stretched\r\n    on a hoop to dry after washing in the blue-water, applying the\r\n    gum with a sponge; or it may be washed finally in water in which\r\n    a lump of sugar has been dissolved, which gives it more the\r\n    appearance of new blonde.\r\n\r\n    2266. Lace collars soil very quickly when in contact with the\r\n    neck; they are cleaned by beating the edge of the collar between\r\n    the folds of a fine linen cloth, then washing the edges as\r\n    directed above, and spreading it out on an ironing-board,\r\n    pinning it at each corner with fine pins; then going carefully\r\n    over it with a sponge charged with water in which some\r\n    gum-dragon and fig-blue have been dissolved, to give it a proper\r\n    consistence. To give the collar the same tint throughout, the\r\n    whole collar should be sponged with the same water, taking care\r\n    not to touch the flowers.\r\n\r\n2267. A multiplicity of accidents occur to soil and spot dresses, which\r\nshould be removed at once. To remove--\r\n\r\n    2268. _Grease-spots_ from cotton or woollen materials of fast\r\n    colours, absorbent pastes, purified bullock's-blood, and even\r\n    common soap, are used, applied to the spot when dry. When the\r\n    colours are not fast, use fuller's-earth or pulverized\r\n    potter's-clay, laid in a layer over the spot, and press it with\r\n    a very hot iron.\r\n\r\n    2269. For Silks, Moires, and plain or brocaded Satins, begin by\r\n    pouring over the spot two drops of rectified spirits of wine;\r\n    cover it over with a linen cloth, and press it with a hot iron,\r\n    changing the linen instantly. The spot will look tarnished, for\r\n    a portion of the grease still remains: this will be removed\r\n    entirely by a little sulphuric ether dropped on the spot, and a\r\n    very little rubbing. If neatly done, no perceptible mark or\r\n    circle will remain; nor will the lustre of the richest silk be\r\n    changed, the union of the two liquids operating with no\r\n    injurious effects from rubbing.\r\n\r\n    2270. _Fruit-spots_ are removed from white and fast-coloured\r\n    cottons by the use of chloride of soda. Commence by cold-soaping\r\n    the article, then touch the spot with a hair-pencil or feather\r\n    dipped in the chloride, dipping it immediately into cold water,\r\n    to prevent the texture of the article being injured.\r\n\r\n    2271. _Ink-spots_ are removed, when fresh applied to the spot,\r\n    by a few drops of hot water being poured on immediately\r\n    afterwards. By the same process, iron-mould in linen or calico\r\n    may be removed, dipping immediately in cold water to prevent\r\n    injury to the fabric.\r\n\r\n    2272. _Wax_ dropped on a shawl, table-cover, or cloth dress, is\r\n    easily discharged by applying spirits of wine.\r\n\r\n    2273. _Syrups or Preserved Fruits_, by washing in lukewarm water\r\n    with a dry cloth, and pressing the spot between two folds of\r\n    clean linen.\r\n\r\n    2274. _Essence of Lemon_ will remove grease, but will make a\r\n    spot itself in a few days.\r\n\r\nTo clean Silk or Ribbons.\r\n\r\n2275. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of gin, 1/2 lb. of honey, 1/2 lb. of soft\r\nsoap, 1/2 pint of water.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the above ingredients together; then lay each breadth of\r\nsilk upon a clean kitchen table or dresser, and scrub it well on the\r\nsoiled side with the mixture. Have ready three vessels of cold water;\r\ntake each piece of silk at two corners, and dip it up and down in each\r\nvessel, but do not wring it; and take care that each breadth has one\r\nvessel of quite clean water for the last dip. Hang it up dripping for a\r\nminute or two, then dab it in a cloth, and iron it quickly with a very\r\nhot iron.\r\n\r\nTo remove Paint-spots from Silk Cloth.\r\n\r\n2276. If the fabric will bear it, sharp rubbing will frequently entirely\r\ndischarge a newly-made paint-stain; but, if this is not successful,\r\napply spirit of turpentine with a quill till the stains disappear.\r\n\r\nTo make old Crape look nearly equal to new.\r\n\r\n2277. Place a little water in a teakettle, and let it boil until there\r\nis plenty of steam from the spout; then, holding the crape in both\r\nhands, pass it to and fro several times through the steam, and it will\r\nto clean and look nearly equal to new.\r\n\r\n2278. Linen.--Before sending linen to wash, the lady's-maid should see\r\nthat everything under her charge is properly mended; for her own sake\r\nshe should take care that it is sent out in an orderly manner, each\r\nclass of garments by themselves, with a proper list, of which she\r\nretains a copy. On its return, it is still more necessary to examine\r\nevery piece separately, so that all missing buttons be supplied, and\r\nonly the articles properly washed and in perfect repair passed into the\r\nwardrobe.\r\n\r\n2279. Ladies who keep a waiting-maid for their own persons are in the\r\nhabit of paying visits to their friends, in which it is not unusual for\r\nthe maid to accompany them; at all events, it is her duty to pack the\r\ntrunks; and this requires not only knowledge but some practice, although\r\nthe improved trunks and portmanteaus now made, in which there is a place\r\nfor nearly everything, render this more simple than formerly. Before\r\npacking, let the trunks be thoroughly well cleaned, and, if necessary,\r\nlined with paper, and everything intended for packing laid out on the\r\nbed or chairs, so that it may be seen what is to be stowed away; the\r\nnicer articles of dress neatly folded in clean calico wrappers. Having\r\nsatisfied herself that everything wanted is laid out, and that it is in\r\nperfect order, the packing is commenced by disposing of the most bulky\r\narticles, the dressing-case and work-box, skirts, and other articles\r\nrequiring room, leaving the smaller articles to fill up; finally, having\r\nsatisfied herself that all is included, she should lock and cover up the\r\ntrunk in its canvas case, and then pack her own box, if she is to\r\naccompany her mistress.\r\n\r\n2280. On reaching the house, the lady's-maid will be shown her lady's\r\napartment; and her duties here are what they were at home; she will\r\narrange her mistress's things, and learn which is her bell, in order to\r\ngo to her when she rings. Her meals will be taken in the housekeeper's\r\nroom; and here she must be discreet and guarded in her talk to any one\r\nof her mistress or her concerns. Her only occupation here will be\r\nattending in her lady's room, keeping her things in order, and making\r\nher rooms comfortable for her.\r\n\r\n2281. The evening duties of a lady's-maid are pretty nearly a repetition\r\nof those of the morning. She is in attendance when her mistress retires;\r\nshe assists her to undress if required, brushes her hair, and renders\r\nsuch other assistance as is demanded; removes all slops; takes care that\r\nthe fire, if any, is safe, before she retires to rest herself.\r\n\r\n2282. Ironing is a part of the duties of a lady's-maid, and she should\r\nbe able to do it in the most perfect manner when it becomes necessary.\r\nIroning is often badly done from inattention to a few very simple\r\nrequirements. Cleanliness is the first essential: the ironing-board, the\r\nfire, the iron, and the ironing-blanket should all be perfectly clean.\r\nIt will not be necessary here to enter into details on ironing, as full\r\ndirections are given in the \"Duties of the Laundry-maid.\" A lady's-maid\r\nwill have a great deal of \"Ironing-out\" to do; such as light evening\r\ndresses, muslin dresses, &c., which are not dirty enough to be washed,\r\nbut merely require smoothing out to remove the creases. In summer,\r\nparticularly, an iron will be constantly required, as also a\r\nskirt-board, which should be covered with a nice clean piece of flannel.\r\nTo keep muslin dresses in order, they almost require smoothing out every\r\ntime they are worn, particularly if made with many flounces. The\r\nlady's-maid may often have to perform little services for her mistress\r\nwhich require care; such as restoring the colour to scorched linen, &c.\r\n&c. The following recipe is, we believe, a very good one.\r\n\r\nTo restore Whiteness to scorched Linen.\r\n\r\n2283. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 pint of vinegar, 2 oz. of fuller's-earth, 1 oz.\r\nof dried fowls' dung, 1/2 oz. of soap, the juice of 2 large onions.\r\n\r\n_Mode._--Boil all these ingredients together to the consistency of\r\npaste; spread the composition thickly over the damaged part, and if the\r\nthreads be not actually consumed, after it has been allowed to dry on,\r\nand the place has subsequently been washed once or twice, every trace of\r\nscorching will disappear.\r\n\r\n    2284. _Furs, Feathers, and Woollens_ require the constant care\r\n    of the waiting-maid. Furs and feathers not in constant use\r\n    should be wrapped up in linen washed in lye. From May to\r\n    September they are subject to being made the depositary of the\r\n    moth-eggs. They should be looked too, and shaken and beaten,\r\n    from time to time, in case some of the eggs should have been\r\n    lodged in them, in spite of every precaution; laying them up\r\n    again, or rather folding them up as before, wrapping them in\r\n    brown paper, which is itself a preservative. Shawls and cloaks,\r\n    which would be damaged by such close folds, must be looked to,\r\n    and aired and beaten, putting them away dry before the evening.\r\n\r\nPreservatives against the Ravages of Moths.\r\n\r\n2285. Place pieces of camphor, cedar-wood, Russia leather,\r\ntobacco-leaves, bog-myrtle, or anything else strongly aromatic, in the\r\ndrawers or boxes where furs or other things to be preserved from moths\r\nare kept, and they will never take harm.\r\n\r\n    2286. _Jewels_ are generally wrapped up in cotton, and kept in\r\n    their cases; but they are subject to tarnish from exposure to\r\n    the air, and require cleaning. This is done by preparing clean\r\n    soap-suds, using fine toilet-soap. Dip any article of gold,\r\n    silver, gilt, or precious stones into this lye, and dry them by\r\n    brushing with a brush of soft badgers' hair, or a fine sponge;\r\n    afterwards with a piece of fine cloth, and, lastly, with a soft\r\n    leather.\r\n\r\n    2287. _Epaulettes_ of gold or silver, and, in general, all\r\n    articles of jewellery, may be dressed by dipping them in spirits\r\n    of wine warmed in a _bain marie,_ or shallow kettle, placed over\r\n    a slow fire or hot-plate.\r\n\r\n2288. The valet and lady's-maid, from their supposed influence with\r\ntheir master and mistress, are exposed to some temptations to which\r\nother servants are less subjected. They are probably in communication\r\nwith the tradespeople who supply articles for the toilet; such as\r\nbatters, tailors, dressmakers, and perfumers. The conduct of\r\nwaiting-maid and valet to these people should be civil but independent,\r\nmaking reasonable allowance for want of exact punctuality, if any such\r\ncan be made: they should represent any inconvenience respectfully, and\r\nif an excuse seems unreasonable, put the matter fairly to master or\r\nmistress, leaving it to them to notice it further, if they think it\r\nnecessary. No expectations of a personal character should influence them\r\none way or the other. It would be acting unreasonably to any domestic to\r\nmake them refuse such presents as tradespeople choose to give them; the\r\nutmost that can be expected is that they should not influence their\r\njudgment in the articles supplied--that they should represent them truly\r\nto master or mistress, without fear and without favour. Civility to all,\r\nservility to none, is a good maxim for every one. Deference to a master\r\nand mistress, and to their friends and visitors, is one of the implied\r\nterms of their engagement; and this deference must apply even to what\r\nmay be considered their whims. A servant is not to be seated, or wear a\r\nhat in the house, in his master's or mistress's presence; nor offer any\r\nopinion, unless asked for it; nor even to say \"good night,\" or \"good\r\nmorning,\" except in reply to that salutation.\r\n\r\nTo preserve cut Flowers.\r\n\r\n2289. A bouquet of freshly-cut flowers may be preserved alive for a long\r\ntime by placing them in a glass or vase with fresh water, in which a\r\nlittle charcoal has been steeped, or a small piece of camphor dissolved.\r\nThe vase should be set upon a plate or dish, and covered with a\r\nbell-glass, around the edges of which, when it comes in contact with the\r\nplate, a little water should be poured to exclude the air.\r\n\r\nTo revive cut Flowers after packing.\r\n\r\n2290. Plunge the stems into boiling water, and by the time the water is\r\ncold, the flowers will have revived. Then cut afresh the ends of the\r\nstems, and keep them in fresh cold water.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPPER AND UNDER HOUSEMAIDS.\r\n\r\n2291. Housemaids, in large establishments, have usually one or more\r\nassistants; in this case they are upper and under housemaids. Dividing\r\nthe work between them, the upper housemaid will probably reserve for\r\nherself the task of dusting the ornaments and cleaning the furniture of\r\nthe principal apartments, but it is her duty to see that every\r\ndepartment is properly attended to. The number of assistants depends on\r\nthe number in the family, as well as on the style in which the\r\nestablishment is kept up. In wealthy families it is not unusual for\r\nevery grown-up daughter to have her waiting-maid, whose duty it is to\r\nkeep her mistress's apartments in order, thus abridging the housemaid's\r\nduties. In others, perhaps, one waiting-maid attends on two or three,\r\nwhen the housemaid's assistance will be more requisite. In fact, every\r\nestablishment has some customs peculiar to itself, on which we need not\r\ndwell; the general duties are the _same in all_, perfect cleanliness and\r\norder being the object.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE HOUSEMAID.\r\n\r\n2292. \"Cleanliness is next to godliness,\" saith the proverb, and \"order\"\r\nis in the next degree; the housemaid, then, may be said to be the\r\nhandmaiden to two of the most prominent virtues. Her duties are very\r\nnumerous, and many of the comforts of the family depend on their\r\nperformance; but they are simple and easy to a person naturally clean\r\nand orderly, and desirous of giving satisfaction. In all families,\r\nwhatever the habits of the master and mistress, servants will find it\r\nadvantageous to rise early; their daily work will thus come easy to\r\nthem. If they rise late, there is a struggle to overtake it, which\r\nthrows an air of haste and hurry over the whole establishment. Where the\r\nmaster's time is regulated by early business or professional\r\nengagements, this will, of course, regulate the hours of the servants;\r\nbut even where that is not the case, servants will find great personal\r\nconvenience in rising early and getting through their work in an orderly\r\nand methodical manner. The housemaid who studies her own ease will\r\ncertainly be at her work by six o'clock in the summer, and, probably,\r\nhalf-past six or seven in the winter months, having spent a reasonable\r\ntime in her own chamber in dressing. Earlier than this would, probably,\r\nbe an unnecessary waste of coals and candle in winter.\r\n\r\n2293. The first duty of the housemaid in winter is to open the shutters\r\nof all the lower rooms in the house, and take up the hearth-rugs of\r\nthose rooms which she is going to \"do\" before breakfast. In some\r\nfamilies, where there is only a cook and housemaid kept, and where the\r\ndrawing-rooms are large, the cook has the care of the dining-room, and\r\nthe housemaid that of the breakfast-room, library, and drawing-rooms.\r\nAfter the shutters are all opened, she sweeps the breakfast-room,\r\nsweeping the dust towards the fire-place, of course previously removing\r\nthe fonder. She should then lay a cloth (generally made of coarse\r\nwrappering) over the carpet in front of the stove, and on this should\r\nplace her housemaid's box, containing black-lead brushes, leathers,\r\nemery-paper, cloth, black lead, and all utensils necessary for cleaning\r\na grate, with the cinder-pail on the other side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARPET-BROOMS.]\r\n\r\n2294. She now sweeps up the ashes, and deposits them in her cinder-pail,\r\nwhich is a japanned tin pail, with a wire-sifter inside, and a\r\nclosely-fitting top. In this pail the cinders are sifted, and reserved\r\nfor use in the kitchen or under the copper, the ashes only being thrown\r\naway. The cinders disposed of, she proceeds to black-lead the grate,\r\nproducing the black lead, the soft brush for laying it on, her blacking\r\nand polishing brushes, from the box which contains her tools. This\r\nhousemaid's box should be kept well stocked. Having blackened, brushed,\r\nand polished every part, and made all clean and bright, she now proceeds\r\nto lay the fire. Sometimes it is very difficult to get a proper polish\r\nto black grates, particularly if they have been neglected, and allowed\r\nto rust at all. Brunswick black, which is an excellent varnish for\r\ngrates, may be prepared in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STOVE BRUSHES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSEMAID'S BOX.]\r\n\r\n2295. INGREDIENTS.--1 lb. of common asphaltum, 1/2 pint of linseed oil,\r\n1 quart of oil of turpentine.\r\n\r\n_Mode._--Melt the asphaltum, and add gradually to it the other two\r\ningredients. Apply this with a small painter's brush, and leave it to\r\nbecome perfectly dry. The grate will need no other cleaning, but will\r\nmerely require dusting every day, and occasionally brushing with a dry\r\nblack-lead brush. This is, of course, when no fires are used. When they\r\nare required, the bars, cheeks, and back of the grate will need\r\nblack-leading in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n    2296. _Fire-lighting,_ however simple, is an operation requiring\r\n    some skill; a fire is readily made by laying a few cinders at\r\n    the bottom in open order; over this a few pieces of paper, and\r\n    over that again eight or ten pieces of dry wood; over the wood,\r\n    a course of moderate-sized pieces of coal, taking care to leave\r\n    hollow spaces between for air at the centre; and taking care to\r\n    lay the whole well back in the grate, so that the smoke may go\r\n    up the chimney, and not into the room. This done, fire the paper\r\n    with a match from below, and, if properly laid, it will soon\r\n    burn up; the stream of flame from the wood and paper soon\r\n    communicating to the coals and cinders, provided there is plenty\r\n    of air at the centre.\r\n\r\n    2297. A new method of lighting a fire is sometimes practised\r\n    with advantage, the fire lighting from the top and burning down,\r\n    in place of being lighted and burning up from below. This is\r\n    arranged by laying the coals at the bottom, mixed with a few\r\n    good-sized cinders, and the wood at the top, with another layer\r\n    of coals and some paper over it; the paper is lighted in the\r\n    usual way, and soon burns down to a good fire, with some economy\r\n    of fuel, as is said.\r\n\r\n2298. Bright grates require unceasing attention to keep them in perfect\r\norder. A day should never pass without the housemaid rubbing with a dry\r\nleather the polished parts of a grate, as also the fender and\r\nfire-irons. A careful and attentive housemaid should have no occasion\r\never to use emery-paper for any part but the bars, which, of course,\r\nbecome blackened by the fire. (Some mistresses, to save labour, have a\r\ndouble set of bars, one set bright for the summer, and another black set\r\nto use when fires are in requisition.) When bright grates are once\r\nneglected, small rust-spots begin to show themselves, which a plain\r\nleather will not remove; the following method of cleaning them must then\r\nbe resorted to:--First, thoroughly clean with emery-paper; then take a\r\nlarge smooth pebble from the road, sufficiently large to hold\r\ncomfortably in the hand, with which rub the steel backwards and forwards\r\none way, until the desired polish is obtained. It may appear at first to\r\nscratch, but continue rubbing, and the result will be success. The\r\nfollowing is also an excellent polish for bright stoves and steel\r\narticles:--\r\n\r\n2299. INGREDIENTS.--1 tablespoonful of turpentine, 1 ditto of sweet oil,\r\nemery powder.\r\n\r\n_Mode._--Mix the turpentine and sweet oil together, stirring in\r\nsufficient emery powder to make the mixture of the thickness of cream.\r\nPut it on the article with a piece of soft flannel, rub off quickly with\r\nanother piece, then polish with a little dry emery powder and clean\r\nleather.\r\n\r\n2300. The several fires lighted, the housemaid proceeds with her\r\ndusting, and polishing the several pieces of furniture in the\r\nbreakfast-parlour, leaving no corner unvisited. Before sweeping the\r\ncarpet, it is a good practice to sprinkle it all over with tea-leaves,\r\nwhich not only lay all dust, but give a slightly fragrant smell to the\r\nroom. It is now in order for the reception of the family; and where\r\nthere is neither footman nor parlour-maid, she now proceeds to the\r\ndressing-room, and lights her mistress's fire, if she is in the habit of\r\nhaving one to dress by. Her mistress is called, hot water placed in the\r\ndressing-room for her use, her clothes--as far as they are under the\r\nhouse-maid's charge--put before the fire to air, hanging a fire-guard on\r\nthe bars where there is one, while she proceeds to prepare the\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n2301. In summer the housemaid's work is considerably abridged: she\r\nthrows open the windows of the several rooms not occupied as bedrooms,\r\nthat they may receive the fresh morning air before they are occupied;\r\nshe prepares the breakfast-room by sweeping the carpet, rubbing tables\r\nand chairs, dusting mantel-shelf and picture-frames with a light brush,\r\ndusting the furniture, and beating and sweeping the rug; she cleans the\r\ngrate when necessary, and replaces the white paper or arranges the\r\nshavings with which it is filled, leaving everything clean and tidy for\r\nbreakfast. It is not enough, however, in cleaning furniture, just to\r\npass lightly over the surface; the rims and legs of tables, and the\r\nbacks and legs of chairs and sofas, should be rubbed vigorously daily;\r\nif there is a book-case, every corner of every pane and ledge requires\r\nto be carefully wiped, so that not a speck of dust can be found in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n2302. After the breakfast-room is finished, the housemaid should proceed\r\nto sweep down the stairs, commencing at the top, whilst the cook has the\r\ncharge of the hall, door-step, and passages. After this she should go\r\ninto the drawing-room, cover up every article of furniture that is\r\nlikely to spoil, with large dusting-sheets, and put the chairs together,\r\nby turning them seat to seat, and, in fact, make as much room as\r\npossible, by placing all the loose furniture in the middle of the room,\r\nwhilst she sweeps the corners and sides. When this is accomplished, the\r\nfurniture can then be put back in its place, and the middle of the room\r\nswept, sweeping the dirt, as before said, towards the fireplace. The\r\nsame rules should be observed in cleaning the drawing-room grates as we\r\nhave just stated, putting down the cloth, before commencing, to prevent\r\nthe carpet from getting soiled. In the country, a room would not require\r\nsweeping thoroughly like this more than twice a week; but the housemaid\r\nshould go over it every morning with a dust-pan and broom, taking up\r\nevery crumb and piece she may see. After the sweeping she should leave\r\nthe room, shut the door, and proceed to lay the breakfast. Where there\r\nis neither footman nor parlour-maid kept, the duty of laying the\r\nbreakfast-cloth rests on the housemaid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BANISTER-BROOM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAIRCASE-BROOM.]\r\n\r\n2303. Before laying the cloth for breakfast, the heater of the tea-urn\r\nis to be placed in the hottest part of the kitchen fire; or, where the\r\nkettle is used, boiled on the kitchen fire, and then removed to the\r\nparlour, where it is kept hot. Having washed herself free from the dust\r\narising from the morning's work, the housemaid collects the\r\nbreakfast-things on her tray, takes the breakfast-cloth from the napkin\r\npress, and carries them all on the tray into the parlour; arranges them\r\non the table, placing a sufficiency of knives, forks, and salt-cellars\r\nfor the family, and takes the tray back to the pantry; gets a supply of\r\nmilk, cream, and bread; fills the butter-dish, taking care that the salt\r\nis plentiful, and soft and dry, and that hot plates and egg-cups are\r\nready where warm meat or eggs are served, and that butter-knife and\r\nbread-knife are in their places. And now she should give the signal for\r\nbreakfast, holding herself ready to fill the urn with hot water, or hand\r\nthe kettle, and take in the rolls, toast, and other eatables, with which\r\nthe cook supplies her, when the breakfast-room bell rings; bearing in\r\nmind that she is never to enter the parlour with dirty hands or with a\r\ndirty apron, and that everything is to be handed on a tray; that she is\r\nto hand everything she may be required to supply, on the left hand of\r\nthe person she is serving, and that all is done quietly and without\r\nbustle or hurry. In some families, where there is a large number to\r\nattend on, the cook waits at breakfast whilst the housemaid is busy\r\nupstairs in the bedrooms, or sweeping, dusting, and putting the\r\ndrawing-room in order.\r\n\r\n2304. Breakfast served, the housemaid proceeds to the bed-chambers,\r\nthrows up the sashes, if not already done, pulls up the blinds, throwing\r\nback curtains at the same time, and opens the beds, by removing the\r\nclothes, placing them over a horse, or, failing that, over the backs of\r\nchairs. She now proceeds to empty the slops. In doing this, everything\r\nis emptied into the slop-pail, leaving a little scalding-hot water for a\r\nminute in such vessels as require it; adding a drop of turpentine to the\r\nwater, when that is not sufficient to cleanse them. The basin is\r\nemptied, well rinsed with clean water, and carefully wiped; the ewers\r\nemptied and washed; finally, the water-jugs themselves emptied out and\r\nrinsed, and wiped dry. As soon as this is done, she should remove and\r\nempty the pails, taking care that they also are well washed, scalded,\r\nand wiped as soon as they are empty.\r\n\r\n2305. Next follows bedmaking, at which the cook or kitchen-maid, where\r\none is kept, usually assists; but, before beginning, velvet chairs, or\r\nother things injured by dust, should be removed to another room. In\r\nbedmaking, the fancy of its occupant should be consulted; some like beds\r\nsloping from the top towards the feet, swelling slightly in the middle;\r\nothers, perfectly flat: a good housemaid will accommodate each bed to\r\nthe taste of the sleeper, taking care to shake, beat, and turn it well\r\nin the process. Some persons prefer sleeping on the mattress; in which\r\ncase a feather bed is usually beneath, resting on a second mattress, and\r\na straw paillasse at the bottom. In this case, the mattresses should\r\nchange places daily; the feather bed placed on the mattress shaken,\r\nbeaten, taken up and opened several times, so as thoroughly to separate\r\nthe feathers: if too large to be thus handled, the maid should shake and\r\nbeat one end first, and then the other, smoothing it afterwards equally\r\nall over into the required shape, and place the mattress gently over it.\r\nAny feathers which escape in this process a tidy servant will put back\r\nthrough the seam of the tick; she will also be careful to sew up any\r\nstitch that gives way the moment it is discovered. The bedclothes are\r\nlaid on, beginning with an under blanket and sheet, which are tucked\r\nunder the mattress at the bottom. The bolster is then beaten and shaken,\r\nand put on, the top of the sheet rolled round it, and the sheet tucked\r\nin all round. The pillows and other bedclothes follow, and the\r\ncounterpane over all, which should fall in graceful folds, and at equal\r\ndistance from the ground all round. The curtains are drawn to the head\r\nand folded neatly across the bed, and the whole finished in a smooth and\r\ngraceful manner. Where spring-mattresses are used, care should be taken\r\nthat the top one is turned every day. The housemaid should now take up\r\nin a dustpan any pieces that may be on the carpet; she should dust the\r\nroom, shut the door, and proceed to another room. When all the bedrooms\r\nare finished, she should dust the stairs, and polish the handrail of the\r\nbanisters, and see that all ledges, window-sills, &c., are quite free\r\nfrom dust. It will be necessary for the housemaid to divide her work, so\r\nthat she may not have too much to do on certain days, and not sufficient\r\nto fill up her time on other days. In the country, bedrooms should be\r\nswept and thoroughly cleaned once a week; and to be methodical and\r\nregular in her work, the housemaid should have certain days for doing\r\ncertain rooms thoroughly. For instance, the drawing-room on Monday, two\r\nbedrooms on Tuesday, two on Wednesday, and so on, reserving a day for\r\nthoroughly cleaning the plate, bedroom candlesticks, &c. &c., which she\r\nwill have to do where there is no parlour-maid or footman kept. By this\r\nmeans the work will be divided, and there will be no unnecessary\r\nbustling and hurrying, as is the case where the work is done any time,\r\nwithout rule or regulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCRUBBING-BRUSH.]\r\n\r\n2306. Once a week, when a bedroom is to be thoroughly cleaned, the\r\nhouse-maid should commence by brushing the mattresses of the bed before\r\nit is made; she should then make it, shake the curtains, lay them\r\nsmoothly on the bed, and pin or tuck up the bottom valance, so that she\r\nmay be able to sweep under the bed. She should then unloop the\r\nwindow-curtains, shake them, and pin them high up out of the way. After\r\nclearing the dressing-table, and the room altogether of little articles\r\nof china, &c. &c., she should shake the toilet-covers, fold them up, and\r\nlay them on the bed, over which a large dusting-sheet should be thrown.\r\nShe should then sweep the room; first of all sprinkling the carpet with\r\nwell-squeezed tea-leaves, or a little freshly-pulled grass, when this is\r\nobtainable. After the carpet is swept, and the grate cleaned, she should\r\nwash with soap and water, with a little soda in it, the washing-table\r\napparatus, removing all marks or fur round the jugs, caused by the\r\nwater. The water-bottles and tumblers must also have her attention, as\r\nwell as the top of the washing-stand, which should be cleaned with soap\r\nand flannel if it be marble: if of polished mahogany, no soap must be\r\nused. When these are all clean and arranged in their places, the\r\nhousemaid should scrub the floor where it is not covered with carpet,\r\nunder the beds, and round the wainscot. She should use as little soap\r\nand soda as possible, as too free a use of these articles is liable to\r\ngive the boards a black appearance. In the country, cold soft water, a\r\nclean scrubbing-brush, and a willing arm, are all that are required to\r\nmake bedroom floors look white. In winter it is not advisable to scrub\r\nrooms too often, as it is difficult to dry them thoroughly at that\r\nseason of the year, and nothing is more dangerous than to allow persons\r\nto sleep in a damp room. The housemaid should now dust the furniture,\r\nblinds, ornaments, &c.; polish the looking-glass; arrange the\r\ntoilet-cover and muslin; remove the cover from the bed, and straighten\r\nand arrange the curtains and counterpane. A bedroom should be cleaned\r\nlike this every week. There are times, however, when it is necessary to\r\nhave the carpet up; this should be done once a year in the country, and\r\ntwice a year in large cities. The best time for these arrangements is\r\nspring and autumn, when the bed-furniture requires changing to suit the\r\nseasons of the year. After arranging the furniture, it should all be\r\nwell rubbed and polished; and for this purpose the housemaid should\r\nprovide herself with an old silk pocket-handkerchief, to finish the\r\npolishing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONG HAIR-BROOM.]\r\n\r\n2307. As modern furniture is now nearly always French-polished, it\r\nshould often be rubbed with an old silk rubber, or a fine cloth or\r\nduster, to keep it free from smears. Three or four times a year any of\r\nthe following polishes may be applied with very great success, as any of\r\nthem make French-polished furniture look very well. One precaution must\r\nbe taken,--not to put too much of the polish on at one time, and _to\r\nrub, not smear_ it over the articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURNITURE POLISH.\r\n\r\n2308. INGREDIENTS.--1/4 pint of linseed-oil, 1/4 pint of vinegar, 1 oz.\r\nof spirits of salts, 1/2 oz. of muriatic antimony.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix all well together, and shake before using.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURNITURE POLISH.\r\n\r\n2309. INGREDIENTS.--Equal proportions of linseed-oil, turpentine,\r\nvinegar, and spirits of wine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--When used, shake the mixture well, and rub on the furniture\r\nwith a piece of linen rag, and polish with a clean duster. Vinegar and\r\noil, rubbed in with flannel, and the furniture rubbed with a clean\r\nduster, produce a very good polish.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURNITURE PASTE.\r\n\r\n2310. INGREDIENTS.--3 oz. of common beeswax, 1 oz. of white wax, 1 oz.\r\nof curd soap, 1 pint of turpentine, 1 pint of boiled water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FURNITURE BRUSH.]\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Mix the ingredients together, adding the water when cold; shake\r\nthe mixture frequently in the bottle, and do not use it for 48 hours\r\nafter it is made. It should be applied with a piece of flannel, the\r\nfurniture polished with a duster, and then with an old silk rubber.\r\n\r\n2311. The chambers are finished, the chamber candlesticks brought down\r\nand cleaned, the parlour lamps trimmed;--and here the housemaid's utmost\r\ncare is required. In cleaning candlesticks, as in every other cleaning,\r\nshe should have cloths and brushes kept for that purpose alone; the\r\nknife used to scrape them should be applied to no other purpose; the\r\ntallow-grease should be thrown into a box kept for the purpose; the same\r\nwith everything connected with the lamp-trimming; the best mode of doing\r\nwhich she will do well to learn from the tradesman who supplies the oil;\r\nalways bearing in mind, however, that without perfect cleanliness, which\r\ninvolves occasional scalding, no lamp can be kept in order.\r\n\r\n2312. The drawing and dining-room, inasmuch as everything there is more\r\ncostly and valuable, require even more care. When the carpets are of the\r\nkind known as velvet-pile, they require to be swept firmly by a hard\r\nwhisk brush, made of cocoanut fibre.\r\n\r\n2313. The furniture must be carefully gone over in every corner with a\r\nsoft cloth, that it may be left perfectly free from dust; or where that\r\nis beyond reach, with a brush made of long feathers, or a goose's wing.\r\nThe sofas are swept in the same manner, slightly beaten, the cushions\r\nshaken and smoothed, the picture-frames swept, and everything arranged\r\nin its proper place. This, of course, applies to dining as well as\r\ndrawing-room and morning-room. And now the housemaid may dress herself\r\nfor the day, and prepare for the family dinner, at which she must\r\nattend.\r\n\r\n2314. We need not repeat the long instructions already given for laying\r\nthe dinner-table. At the family dinner, even where no footman waits, the\r\nroutine will be the same. In most families the cloth is laid with the\r\nslips on each side, with napkins, knives, forks, spoons, and wine and\r\nfinger glasses on all occasions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTLER'S TRAY AND STAND.]\r\n\r\n2315. She should ascertain that her plate is in order, glasses free from\r\nsmears, water-bottles and decanters the same, and everything ready on\r\nher tray, that she may be able to lay her cloth properly. Few things add\r\nmore to the neat and comfortable appearance of a dinner-table than\r\nwell-polished plate; indeed, the state of the plate is a certain\r\nindication of a well-managed or ill-managed household. Nothing is easier\r\nthan to keep plate in good order, and yet many servants, from stupidity\r\nand ignorance, make it the greatest trouble of all things under their\r\ncare. It should be remembered, that it is utterly impossible to make\r\ngreasy silver take a polish; and that as spoons and forks in daily use\r\nare continually in contact with grease, they must require good washing\r\nin soap-and-water to remove it. Silver should be washed with a soapy\r\nflannel in one water, rinsed in another, and then wiped dry with a dry\r\ncloth. The plate so washed may be polished with the plate-rags, as in\r\nthe following directions:--Once a week all the plate should receive a\r\nthorough cleaning with the hartshorn powder, as directed in the first\r\nrecipe for cleaning plate; and where the housemaid can find time, rubbed\r\nevery day with the plate-rags.\r\n\r\n    2316. Hartshorn, we may observe, is one of the best possible\r\n    ingredients for plate-powder in daily use. It leaves on the\r\n    silver a deep, dark polish, and at the same time does less\r\n    injury than anything else. It has also the advantage of being\r\n    very cheap; almost all the ordinary powders sold in boxes\r\n    containing more or less of quicksilver, in some form or another;\r\n    and this in process of time is sure to make the plate brittle.\r\n    If any one wishes to be convinced of the effect of quicksilver\r\n    on plate, he has only to rub a little of it on one place for\r\n    some time,--on the handle of a silver teaspoon for instance, and\r\n    he will find it break in that spot with very little pressure.\r\n\r\nTo Clean Plate.\r\n\r\n_A very excellent method._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE-BRUSH.]\r\n\r\n2317. Wash the plate well to remove all grease, in a strong lather of\r\ncommon yellow soap and boiling water, and wipe it quite dry; then mix as\r\nmuch hartshorn powder as will be required, into a thick paste, with cold\r\nwater or spirits of wine; smear this lightly over the plate with a piece\r\nof soft rag, and leave it for some little time to dry. When perfectly\r\ndry, brush it off quite clean with a soft plate-brush, and polish the\r\nplate with a dry leather. If the plate be very dirty, or much tarnished,\r\nspirits of wine will be found to answer better than the water for mixing\r\nthe paste.\r\n\r\nPlate-rags for daily use.\r\n\r\n2318. Boil soft rags (nothing is better for the purpose than the tops of\r\nold cotton stockings) in a mixture of new milk and hartshorn powder, in\r\nthe proportion of 1 oz. of powder to a pint of milk; boil them for 5\r\nminutes; wring them as soon as they are taken out, for a moment, in cold\r\nwater, and dry them before the fire. With these rags rub the plate\r\nbriskly as soon as it has been well washed and dried after daily use. A\r\nmost beautiful deep polish will be produced, and the plate will require\r\nnothing more than merely to be dusted with a leather or a dry soft\r\ncloth, before it is again put on the table.\r\n\r\n2319. For waiting at table, the housemaid should be neatly and cleanly\r\ndressed, and, if possible, her dress made with closed sleeves, the large\r\nopen ones dipping and falling into everything on the table, and being\r\nvery much in the way. She should not wear creaking boots, and should\r\nmove about the room as noiselessly as possible, anticipating people's\r\nwants by handing them things without being asked for them, and\r\naltogether be as quiet as possible. It will be needless here to repeat\r\nwhat we have already said respecting waiting at table, in the duties of\r\nthe butler and footman: rules that are good to be observed by them, are\r\nequally good for the parlour-maid or housemaid.\r\n\r\n2320. The housemaid having announced that dinner is on the table, will\r\nhand the soup, fish, meat, or side-dishes to the different members of\r\nthe family; but in families who do not spend much of the day together,\r\nthey will probably prefer being alone at dinner and breakfast; the\r\nhousemaid will be required, after all are helped, if her master does not\r\nwish her to stay in the room, to go on with her work of cleaning up in\r\nthe pantry, and answer the bell when rung. In this case she will place a\r\npile of plates on the table or a dumbwaiter, within reach of her master\r\nand mistress, and leave the room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRUMB-BRUSH].\r\n\r\n2321. Dinner over, the housemaid removes the plates and dishes on the\r\ntray, places the dirty knives and forks in the basket prepared for them,\r\nfolds up the napkins in the ring which indicates by which member of the\r\nfamily it has been used, brushes off the crumbs on the hand-tray kept\r\nfor the purpose, folds up the table-cloth in the folds already made, and\r\nplaces it in the linen-press to be smoothed out. After every meal the\r\ntable should be rubbed, all marks from hot plates removed, and the\r\ntable-cover thrown over, and the room restored to its usual order. If\r\nthe family retire to the drawing-room, or any other room, it is a good\r\npractice to throw up the sash to admit fresh air and ventilate the room.\r\n\r\n2322. The housemaid's evening service consists in washing up the\r\ndinner-things, the plate, plated articles, and glasses, restoring\r\neverything to its place; cleaning up her pantry, and putting away\r\neverything for use when next required; lastly, preparing for tea, as the\r\ntime approaches, by setting the things out on the tray, getting the urn\r\nor kettle ready, with cream and other things usually partaken of at that\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\n2323. In summer-time the windows of all the bedrooms, which have been\r\nclosed during the heat of the day, should be thrown open for an hour or\r\nso after sunset, in order to air them. Before dark they should be\r\nclosed, the bedclothes turned down, and the night-clothes laid in order\r\nfor use when required. During winter, where fires are required in the\r\ndressing-rooms, they should be lighted an hour before the usual time of\r\nretiring, placing a fire-guard before each fire. At the same time, the\r\nnight-things on the horse should be placed before it to be aired, with a\r\ntin can of hot water, if the mistress is in the habit of washing before\r\ngoing to bed. We may add, that there is no greater preservative of\r\nbeauty than washing the face every night in hot water. The housemaid\r\nwill probably be required to assist her mistress to undress and put her\r\ndress in order for the morrow; in which case her duties are very much\r\nthose of the lady's-maid.\r\n\r\n2324. And now the fire is made up for the night, the fireguard replaced,\r\nand everything in the room in order for the night, the housemaid taking\r\ncare to leave the night-candle and matches together in a convenient\r\nplace, should they be required. It is usual in summer to remove all\r\nhighly fragrant flowers from sleeping-rooms, the impression being that\r\ntheir scent is injurious in a close chamber.\r\n\r\n2325. On leisure days, the housemaid should be able to do some\r\nneedlework for her mistress,--such as turning and mending sheets and\r\ndarning the house linen, or assist her in anything she may think fit to\r\ngive her to do. For this reason it is almost essential that a housemaid,\r\nin a small family, should be an expert needlewoman; as, if she be a good\r\nmanager and an active girl, she will have time on her hands to get\r\nthrough plenty of work.\r\n\r\n2326. _Periodical Cleanings_.--Besides the daily routine which we have\r\ndescribed, there are portions of every house which can only be\r\nthoroughly cleaned occasionally; at which time the whole house usually\r\nundergoes a more thorough cleaning than is permitted in the general way.\r\nOn these occasions it is usual to begin at the top of the house and\r\nclean downwards; moving everything out of the room; washing the\r\nwainscoting or paint with soft soap and water; pulling down the beds and\r\nthoroughly cleansing all the joints; \"scrubbing\" the floor; beating\r\nfeather beds, mattress, and paillasse, and thoroughly purifying every\r\narticle of furniture before it is put back in its place.\r\n\r\n2327. This general cleaning usually takes place in the spring or early\r\nsummer, when the warm curtains of winter are replaced by the light and\r\ncheerful muslin curtains. Carpets are at the same time taken up and\r\nbeaten, except where the mistress of the house has been worried into an\r\nexperiment by the often-reiterated question, \"Why beat your carpets?\" In\r\nthis case she will probably have made up her mind to try the cleaning\r\nprocess, and arranged with the company to send for them on the morning\r\nwhen cleaning commenced. It is hardly necessary to repeat, that on this\r\noccasion every article is to be gone over, the French-polished furniture\r\nwell rubbed and polished. The same thorough system of cleaning should be\r\ndone throughout the house; the walls cleaned where painted, and swept\r\ndown with a soft broom or feather brush where papered; the window and\r\nbed curtains, which have been replaced with muslin ones, carefully\r\nbrushed, or, if they require it, cleaned; lamps not likely to be\r\nrequired, washed out with hot water, dried, and cleaned. The several\r\ngrates are now to be furnished with their summer ornaments; and we know\r\nnone prettier than the following, which the housemaid may provide at a\r\nsmall expense to her mistress:--Purchase two yards and a half of\r\ncrinoline muslin, and tear it into small strips, the selvage way of the\r\nmaterial, about an inch wide; strip this thread by thread on each side,\r\nleaving the four centre threads; this gives about six-and-thirty pieces,\r\nfringed on each side, which are tied together at one end, and fastened\r\nto the trap of the register, while the threads, unravelled, are spread\r\ngracefully about the grate, the lower part of which is filled with paper\r\nshavings. This makes a very elegant and very cheap ornament, which is\r\nmuch stronger, besides, than those usually purchased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORNICE-BRUSH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE-PAIL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUSTING-BRUSH.]\r\n\r\n2328. As winter approaches, this house-cleaning will have to be\r\nrepeated, and the warm bed and window curtains replaced. The process of\r\nscouring and cleaning is again necessary, and must be gone through,\r\nbeginning at the top, and going through the house, down to the kitchens.\r\n\r\n2329. Independently of these daily and periodical cleanings, other\r\noccupations will present themselves from time to time, which the\r\nhousemaid will have to perform. When spots show on polished furniture,\r\nthey can generally be restored by soap-and-water and a sponge, the\r\npolish being brought out by using a little polish, and then well rubbing\r\nit. Again, drawers which draw out stiffly may be made to move more\r\neasily if the spot where they press is rubbed over with a little soap.\r\n\r\n2330. Chips broken off any of the furniture should be collected and\r\nreplaced, by means of a little glue applied to it. Liquid glue, which is\r\nsold prepared in bottles, is very useful to have in the house, as it\r\nrequires no melting; and anything broken can be so quickly repaired.\r\n\r\n2331. Breaking glass and china is about the most disagreeable thing that\r\ncan happen in a family, and it is, probably, a greater annoyance to a\r\nright-minded servant than to the mistress. A neat-handed housemaid may\r\nsometimes repair these breakages, where they are not broken in very\r\nconspicuous places, by joining the pieces very neatly together with a\r\ncement made as follows:--Dissolve an ounce of gum mastic in a quantity\r\nof highly-rectified spirits of wine; then soften an ounce of isinglass\r\nin warm water, and, finally, dissolve it in rum or brandy, till it forms\r\na thick jelly. Mix the isinglass and gum mastic together, adding a\r\nquarter of an ounce of finely-powdered gum ammoniac; put the whole into\r\nan earthen pipkin, and in a warm place, till they are thoroughly\r\nincorporated together; pour it into a small phial, and cork it down for\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n2332. In using it, dissolve a small piece of the cement in a silver\r\nteaspoon over a lighted candle. The broken pieces of glass or china\r\nbeing warmed, and touched with the now liquid cement, join the parts\r\nneatly together, and hold in their places till the cement has set; then\r\nwipe away the cement adhering to the edge of the joint, and leave it for\r\ntwelve hours without touching it: the joint will be as strong as the\r\nchina itself, and if neatly done, it will show no joining. It is\r\nessential that neither of the pieces be wetted either with hot or cold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL RECIPES FOR HOUSEMAIDS.\r\n\r\nTo clean Marble.\r\n\r\n2333. Mix with 1/4 pint of soap lees, 1/2 gill of turpentine, sufficient\r\npipe-clay and bullock's gall to make the whole into rather a thick\r\npaste. Apply it to the marble with a soft brush, and after a day or two,\r\nwhen quite dry, rub it off with a soft rag. Apply this a second or third\r\ntime till the marble is quite clean.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother method.\r\n\r\n2334. Take two parts of soda, one of pumice-stone, and one of\r\nfinely-powdered chalk. Sift these through a fine sieve, and mix them\r\ninto a paste with water. Rub this well all over the marble, and the\r\nstains will be removed; then wash it with soap-and-water, and a\r\nbeautiful bright polish will be produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo clean Floorcloth.\r\n\r\n2335. After having washed the floorcloth in the usual manner with a damp\r\nflannel, wet it all over with milk and rub it well with a dry cloth,\r\nwhen a most beautiful polish will be brought out. Some persons use for\r\nrubbing a well-waxed flannel; but this in general produces an unpleasant\r\nslipperiness, which is not the case with the milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo clean Decanters.\r\n\r\n2336. Roll up in small pieces some soft brown or blotting paper; wet\r\nthem, and soap them well. Put them into the decanters about one quarter\r\nfull of warm water; shake them well for a few minutes, then rinse with\r\nclear cold water; wipe the outsides with a nice dry cloth, put the\r\ndecanters to drain, and when dry they will be almost as bright as new\r\nones.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo brighten Gilt Frames.\r\n\r\n2337. Take sufficient flour of sulphur to give a golden tinge to about\r\n1-1/2 pint of water, and in this boil 4 or 5 bruised onions, or garlic,\r\nwhich will answer the same purpose. Strain off the liquid, and with it,\r\nwhen cold, wash, with a soft brush, any gilding which requires\r\nrestoring, and when dry it will come out as bright as new work.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preserve bright Grates or Fire-irons from Rust.\r\n\r\n2338. Make a strong paste of fresh lime and water, and with a fine brush\r\nsmear it as thickly as possible over all the polished surface requiring\r\npreservation. By this simple means, all the grates and fire-irons in an\r\nempty house may be kept for months free from harm, without further care\r\nor attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nGerman Furniture-Gloss.\r\n\r\n2339. INGREDIENTS.--1/2 lb. yellow wax, 1 oz. black rosin, 2 oz. of oil\r\nof turpentine.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Cut the wax into small pieces, and melt it in a pipkin, with\r\nthe rosin pounded very fine. Stir in gradually, while these two\r\ningredients are quite warm, the oil of turpentine. Keep this composition\r\nwell covered for use in a tin or earthen pot. A little of this gloss\r\nshould be spread on a piece of coarse woollen cloth, and the furniture\r\nwell rubbed with it; afterwards it should be polished with a fine cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE MAID-OF-ALL-WORK.\r\n\r\n2340. The general servant, or maid-of-all-work, is perhaps the only one\r\nof her class deserving of commiseration: her life is a solitary one, and\r\nin, some places, her work is never done. She is also subject to rougher\r\ntreatment than either the house or kitchen-maid, especially in her\r\nearlier career: she starts in life, probably a girl of thirteen, with\r\nsome small tradesman's wife as her mistress, just a step above her in\r\nthe social scale; and although the class contains among them many\r\nexcellent, kind-hearted women, it also contains some very rough\r\nspecimens of the feminine gender, and to some of these it occasionally\r\nfalls to give our maid-of-all-work her first lessons in her multifarious\r\noccupations: the mistress's commands are the measure of the\r\nmaid-of-all-work's duties. By the time she has become a tolerable\r\nservant, she is probably engaged in some respectable tradesman's house,\r\nwhere she has to rise with the lark, for she has to do in her own person\r\nall the work which in larger establishments is performed by cook,\r\nkitchen-maid, and housemaid, and occasionally the part of a footman's\r\nduty, which consists in carrying messages.\r\n\r\n2341. The general servant's duties commence by opening the shutters (and\r\nwindows, if the weather permits) of all the lower apartments in the\r\nhouse; she should then brush up her kitchen-range, light the fire, clear\r\naway the ashes, clean the hearth, and polish with a leather the bright\r\nparts of the range, doing all as rapidly and as vigorously as possible,\r\nthat no more time be wasted than is necessary. After putting on the\r\nkettle, she should then proceed to the dining-room or parlour to get it\r\nin order for breakfast. She should first roll up the rug, take up the\r\nfender, shake and fold up the table-cloth, then sweep the room, carrying\r\nthe dirt towards the fireplace; a coarse cloth should then be laid down\r\nover the carpet, and she should proceed to clean the grate, having all\r\nher utensils close to her. When the grate is finished, the ashes cleared\r\naway, the hearth cleaned, and the fender put back in its place, she must\r\ndust the furniture, not omitting the legs of the tables and chairs; and\r\nif there are any ornaments or things on the sideboard, she must not dust\r\nround them, but lift them up on to another place, dust well where they\r\nhave been standing, and then replace the things. Nothing annoys a\r\nparticular mistress so much as to find, when she comes down stairs,\r\ndifferent articles of furniture looking as if they had never been\r\ndusted. If the servant is at all methodical, and gets into a habit of\r\n_doing_ a room in a certain way, she will scarcely ever leave her duties\r\nneglected. After the rug is put down, the table-cloth arranged, and\r\neverything in order, she should lay the cloth for breakfast, and then\r\nshut the dining-room door.\r\n\r\n2342. The hall must now be swept, the mats shaken, the door-step\r\ncleaned, and any brass knockers or handles polished up with the leather.\r\nIf the family breakfast very early, the tidying of the hall must then be\r\ndeferred till after that meal. After cleaning the boots that are\r\nabsolutely required, the servant should now wash her hands and face, put\r\non a clean white apron, and be ready for her mistress when she comes\r\ndown stairs. In families where there is much work to do before\r\nbreakfast, the master of the house frequently has two pairs of boots in\r\nwear, so that they may be properly cleaned when the servant has more\r\ntime to do them, in the daytime. This arrangement is, perhaps, scarcely\r\nnecessary in the summer-time, when there are no grates to clean every\r\nmorning; but in the dark days of winter it is only kind and thoughtful\r\nto lighten a servant-of-all-work's duties as much as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACKING-BRUSH BOX.]\r\n\r\n2343. She will now carry the urn into the dining-room, where her\r\nmistress will make the tea or coffee, and sometimes will boil the eggs,\r\nto insure them being done to her liking. In the mean time the servant\r\ncooks, if required, the bacon, kidneys, fish, &c.;--if cold meat is to\r\nbe served, she must always send it to table on a clean dish, and nicely\r\ngarnished with tufts of parsley, if this is obtainable.\r\n\r\n2344. After she has had her own breakfast, and whilst the family are\r\nfinishing theirs, she should go upstairs into the bedrooms, open all the\r\nwindows, strip the clothes off the beds, and leave them to air whilst\r\nshe is clearing away the breakfast things. She should then take up the\r\ncrumbs in a dustpan from under the table, put the chairs in their\r\nplaces, and sweep up the hearth.\r\n\r\n2345. The breakfast things washed up, the kitchen should be tidied, so\r\nthat it may be neat when her mistress comes in to give the orders for\r\nthe day: after receiving these orders, the servant should go upstairs\r\nagain, with a jug of boiling water, the slop-pail, and two cloths. After\r\nemptying the slops, and scalding the vessels with the boiling water, and\r\nwiping them thoroughly dry, she should wipe the top of the wash-table\r\nand arrange it all in order. She then proceeds to make the beds, in\r\nwhich occupation she is generally assisted by the mistress, or, if she\r\nhave any daughters, by one of them. Before commencing to make the bed,\r\nthe servant should put on a large bed-apron, kept for this purpose only,\r\nwhich should be made very wide, to button round the waist and meet\r\nbehind, while it should be made as long as the dress. By adopting this\r\nplan, the blacks and dirt on servants' dresses (which at all times it is\r\nimpossible to help) will not rub off on to the bed-clothes, mattresses,\r\nand bed furniture. When the beds are made, the rooms should be dusted,\r\nthe stairs lightly swept down, hall furniture, closets, &c., dusted. The\r\nlady of the house, where there is but one servant kept, frequently takes\r\ncharge of the drawing-room herself, that is to say, dusting it; the\r\nservant sweeping, cleaning windows, looking-glasses, grates, and rough\r\nwork of that sort. If there are many ornaments and knick-knacks about\r\nthe room, it is certainly better for the mistress to dust these herself,\r\nas a maid-of-all-work's hands are not always in a condition to handle\r\ndelicate ornaments.\r\n\r\n2346. Now she has gone the rounds of the house and seen that all is in\r\norder, the servant goes to her kitchen to see about the cooking of the\r\ndinner, in which very often her mistress will assist her. She should put\r\non a coarse apron with a bib to do her dirty work in, which may be\r\neasily replaced by a white one if required.\r\n\r\n2347. Half an hour before dinner is ready, she should lay the cloth,\r\nthat everything may be in readiness when she is dishing up the dinner,\r\nand take all into the dining-room that is likely to be required, in the\r\nway of knives, forks, spoons, bread, salt, water, &c. &c. By exercising\r\na little forethought, much confusion and trouble may be saved both to\r\nmistress and servant, by getting everything ready for the dinner in good\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n2348. After taking in the dinner, when every one is seated, she removes\r\nthe covers, hands the plates round, and pours out the beer; and should\r\nbe careful to hand everything on the left side of the person she is\r\nwaiting on.\r\n\r\n2349. We need scarcely say that a maid-of-all-work cannot stay in the\r\ndining-room during the whole of dinner-time, as she must dish up her\r\npudding, or whatever is served after the first course. When she sees\r\nevery one helped, she should leave the room to make her preparations for\r\nthe next course; and anything that is required, such as bread, &c.,\r\npeople may assist themselves to in the absence of the servant.\r\n\r\n2350. When the dinner things are cleared away, the servant should sweep\r\nup the crumbs in the dining-room, sweep the hearth, and lightly dust the\r\nfurniture, then sit down to her own dinner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KNIFE-CLEANING MACHINE]\r\n\r\n2351. After this, she washes up and puts away the dinner things, sweeps\r\nthe kitchen, dusts and tidies it, and puts on the kettle for tea. She\r\nshould now, before dressing herself for the afternoon, clean her knives,\r\nboots, and shoes, and do any other dirty work in the scullery that may\r\nbe necessary. Knife-cleaning machines are rapidly taking the place, in\r\nmost households, of the old knife-board. The saving of labour by the\r\nknife-cleaner is very great, and its performance of the work is very\r\nsatisfactory. Small and large machines are manufactured, some cleaning\r\nonly four knives, whilst others clean as many as twelve at once. Nothing\r\ncan be more simple than the process of machine knife-cleaning; and\r\nalthough, in a very limited household, the substitution of the machine\r\nfor the board may not be necessary, yet we should advise all\r\nhousekeepers, to whom the outlay is not a difficulty, to avail\r\nthemselves of the services of a machine. We have already spoken of its\r\nmanagement in the \"Duties of the Footman,\" No. 2177.\r\n\r\n2352. When the servant is dressed, she takes in the tea, and after tea\r\nturns down the beds, sees that the water-jugs and bottles are full,\r\ncloses the windows, and draws down the blinds. If the weather is very\r\nwarm, these are usually left open until the last thing at night, to cool\r\nthe rooms.\r\n\r\n2353. The routine of a general servant's duties depends upon the kind of\r\nsituation she occupies; but a systematic maid-of-all-work should so\r\ncontrive to divide her work, that every day in the week may have its\r\nproper share. By this means she is able to keep the house clean with\r\nless fatigue to herself than if she left all the cleaning to do at the\r\nend of the week. Supposing there are five bedrooms in the house, two\r\nsitting-rooms, kitchen, scullery, and the usual domestic offices:--on\r\nMonday she should thoroughly clean the drawing-room; on Tuesday, two of\r\nthe bedrooms; on Wednesday, two more; on Thursday, the other bedroom and\r\nstairs; on Friday morning she should sweep the dining-room very\r\nthoroughly, clean the hall, and in the afternoon her kitchen tins and\r\nbright utensils. By arranging her work in this manner, no undue\r\nproportion will fall to Saturday's share, and she will then have this\r\nday for cleaning plate, cleaning her kitchen, and arranging everything\r\nin nice order. The regular work must, of course, be performed in the\r\nusual manner, as we have endeavoured to describe.\r\n\r\n2354. Before retiring to bed, she will do well to clean up glasses,\r\nplates, &c. which have been used for the evening meal, and prepare for\r\nher morning's work by placing her wood near the fire, on the hob, to\r\ndry, taking care there is no danger of it igniting, before she leaves\r\nthe kitchen for the night. Before retiring, she will have to lock and\r\nbolt the doors, unless the master undertakes this office himself.\r\n\r\n2355. If the washing, or even a portion of it, is done at home, it will\r\nbe impossible for the maid-of-all-work to do her household duties\r\nthoroughly, during the time it is about, unless she have some\r\nassistance. Usually, if all the washing is done at home, the mistress\r\nhires some one to assist at the wash-tub, and sees to little matters\r\nherself, in the way of dusting, clearing away breakfast things, folding,\r\nstarching, and ironing the fine things. With a little management much\r\ncan be accomplished, provided the mistress be industrious, energetic,\r\nand willing to lend a helping hand. Let washing-week be not the excuse\r\nfor having everything in a muddle; and although \"things\" cannot be\r\ncleaned so thoroughly, and so much time spent upon them, as ordinarily,\r\nyet the house may be kept tidy and clear from litter without a great\r\ndeal of exertion either on the part of the mistress or servant. We will\r\nconclude our remarks with an extract from an admirably-written book,\r\ncalled \"Home Truths for Home Peace.\" The authoress says, with respect to\r\nthe great wash--\"Amongst all the occasions in which it is most difficult\r\nand glorious to keep muddle out of a family, 'the great wash' stands\r\npre-eminent; and as very little money is now saved by having\r\n_everything_ done at home, many ladies, with the option of taking\r\nanother servant or putting out the chief part of the washing, have\r\nthankfully adopted the latter course.\" She goes on to say--\"When a\r\ngentleman who dines at home can't bear washing in the house, but gladly\r\npays for its being done elsewhere, the lady should gratefully submit to\r\nhis wishes, and put out anything in her whole establishment rather than\r\nput out a good and generous husband.\"\r\n\r\n2356. A bustling and active girl will always find time to do a little\r\nneedlework for herself, if she lives with consistent and reasonable\r\npeople. In the summer evenings she should manage to sit down for two or\r\nthree hours, and for a short time in the afternoon in leisure days. A\r\ngeneral servant's duties are so multifarious, that unless she be quick\r\nand active, she will not be able to accomplish this. To discharge these\r\nvarious duties properly is a difficult task, and sometimes a thankless\r\noffice; but it must be remembered that a good maid-of-all-work will make\r\na good servant in any capacity, and may be safely taken not only without\r\nfear of failure, but with every probability of giving satisfaction to\r\nher employer.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE DAIRY-MAID.\r\n\r\n2357. The duties of the dairy-maid differ considerably in different\r\ndistricts. In Scotland, Wales, and some of the northern counties, women\r\nmilk the cows. On some of the large dairy farms in other parts of\r\nEngland, she takes her share in the milking, but in private families the\r\nmilking is generally performed by the cowkeeper, and the dairy-maid only\r\nreceives the milkpails from him morning and night, and empties and\r\ncleans them preparatory to the next milking; her duty being to supply\r\nthe family with milk, cream, and butter, and other luxuries depending on\r\nthe \"milky mothers\" of the herd.\r\n\r\n    2358. _The Dairy._--The object with which gentlemen keep cows is\r\n    to procure milk unadulterated, and sweet butter, for themselves\r\n    and families: in order to obtain this, however, great\r\n    cleanliness is required, and as visitors, as well as the\r\n    mistress of the house, sometimes visit the dairy, some efforts\r\n    are usually made to render it ornamental and picturesque. The\r\n    locality is usually fixed near to the house; it should neither\r\n    be exposed to the fierce heat of the summer's sun nor to the\r\n    equally unfavourable frosts of winter--it must be both sheltered\r\n    and shaded. If it is a building apart from the house and other\r\n    offices, the walls should be tolerably thick, and if hollow, the\r\n    temperature will be more equable. The walls inside are usually\r\n    covered with Dutch glazed tiles; the flooring also of glazed\r\n    tiles set in asphalte, to resist water; and the ceiling, lath\r\n    and plaster, or closely-jointed woodwork, painted. Its\r\n    architecture will be a matter of fancy: it should have a\r\n    northern aspect, and a thatched roof is considered most\r\n    suitable, from the shade and shelter it affords; and it should\r\n    contain at least two apartments, besides a cool place for\r\n    storing away butter. One of the apartments, in which the milk is\r\n    placed to deposit cream, or to ripen for churning, is usually\r\n    surrounded by shelves of marble or slate, on which the\r\n    milk-dishes rest; but it will be found a better plan to have a\r\n    large square or round table of stone in the centre, with a\r\n    water-tight ledge all round it, in which water may remain in hot\r\n    weather, or, if some attempt at the picturesque is desired, a\r\n    small fountain might occupy the centre, which would keep the\r\n    apartment cool and fresh. Round this table the milk-dishes\r\n    should be ranged; one shelf, or dresser, of slate or marble,\r\n    being kept for the various occupations of the dairy-maid: it\r\n    will be found a better plan than putting them on shelves and\r\n    corners against the wall. There should be a funnel or ventilator\r\n    in the ceiling, communicating with the open air, made to open\r\n    and shut as required. Double windows are recommended, but of the\r\n    lattice kind, so that they may open, and with wire-gauze blinds\r\n    fitted into the opening, and calico blinds, which may be wetted\r\n    when additional coolness is required. The other apartment will\r\n    be used for churning, washing, and scrubbing--in fact, the\r\n    scullery of the dairy, with a boiler for hot water, and a sink\r\n    with cold water laid on, which should be plentiful and good. In\r\n    some dairies a third apartment, or, at least, a cool airy\r\n    pantry, is required for storing away butter, with shelves of\r\n    marble or slate, to hold the cream-jars while it is ripening;\r\n    and where cheeses are made, a fourth becomes necessary. The\r\n    dairy utensils are not numerous,--_churns_, _milk-pails_ for\r\n    each cow, _hair-sieves_, _slices of tin_, milk-pans, marble\r\n    dishes for cream for family use, scales and weights, a portable\r\n    rack for drying the utensils, _wooden bowls_, butter-moulds and\r\n    butter-patters, and _wooden tubs_ for washing the utensils,\r\n    comprising pretty nearly everything.\r\n\r\n    2359. _Pails_ are made of maple-wood or elm, and hooped, or of\r\n    tin, more or less ornamented. One is required for each cow.\r\n\r\n    2360. The _Hair-Sieve_ is made of closely-twisted horse-hair,\r\n    with a rim, through which the milk is strained to remove any\r\n    hairs which may have dropped from the cow in milking.\r\n\r\n    2361. _Milk-Dishes_ are shallow basins of glass, of glazed\r\n    earthenware, or tin, about 16 inches in diameter at top, and 12\r\n    at the bottom, and 5 or 6 inches deep, holding about 8 to 10\r\n    quarts each when full.\r\n\r\n    2362. _Churns_ are of all sorts and sizes, from that which\r\n    churns 70 or 80 gallons by means of a strap from the engine, to\r\n    the square box in which a pound of butter is made. The churn\r\n    used for families is a square box, 18 inches by 12 or 13, and 17\r\n    deep, bevelled below to the plane of the _dashers_, with a loose\r\n    lid or cover. The dasher consists of an axis of wood, to which\r\n    the four beaters or fanners are attached; these fans are simply\r\n    four pieces of elm strongly dovetailed together, forming an\r\n    oblong square, with a space left open, two of the openings being\r\n    left broader than the others; attached to an axle, they form an\r\n    axis with four projecting blades; the axle fits into supports at\r\n    the centre of the box; a handle is fitted to it, and the act of\r\n    churning is done by turning the handle.\r\n\r\n    2363. Such is the temple in which the dairy-maid presides: it\r\n    should be removed both from stable and cowhouse, and larder; no\r\n    animal smells should come near it, and the drainage should be\r\n    perfect.\r\n\r\n2364. The dairy-maid receives the milk from the cowkeeper, each pail\r\nbeing strained through the hair-sieve into one of the milk-basins. This\r\nis left in the basins from twenty-four to thirty-six hours in the\r\nsummer, according to the weather; after which it is skimmed off by means\r\nof the slicer, and poured into glazed earthenware jars to \"turn\" for\r\nchurning. Some persons prefer making up a separate churning for the milk\r\nof each cow; in which there is some advantage. In this case the basins\r\nof each cow, for two days, would either be kept together or labelled. As\r\nsoon as emptied, the pails should be scalded and every particle of milk\r\nwashed out, and placed away in a dry place till next required; and all\r\nmilk spilt on the floor, or on the table or dresser, cleaned up with a\r\ncloth and hot water. Where very great attention is paid to the dairy,\r\nthe milk-coolers are used larger in winter, when it is desirable to\r\nretard the cooling down and increase the creamy deposit, and smaller in\r\nsummer, to hasten it; the temperature required being from 55° to 50°, In\r\nsummer it is sometimes expedient, in very sultry weather, to keep the\r\ndairy fresh and cool by suspending cloths dipped in chloride of lime\r\nacross the room.\r\n\r\n2365. In some dairies it is usual to churn twice, and in others three\r\ntimes a week: the former produces the best butter, the other the\r\ngreatest quantity. With three cows, the produce should be 27 to 30\r\nquarts a day. The dairy-maid should churn every day when very hot, if\r\nthey are in full milk, and every second day in more temperate weather;\r\nbesides supplying the milk and cream required for a large establishment.\r\nThe churning should always be done in the morning: the dairy-maid will\r\nfind it advantageous in being at work on churning mornings by five\r\no'clock. The operation occupies from 20 minutes to half an hour in\r\nsummer, and considerably longer in winter. A steady uniform motion is\r\nnecessary to produce sweet butter; neither too quick nor too slow. Rapid\r\nmotion causes the cream to heave and swell, from too much air being\r\nforced into it: the result is a tedious churning, and soft, bad-coloured\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n2366. In spring and summer, when the cow has her natural food, no\r\nartificial colour is required; but in winter, under stall-feeding, the\r\ncolour is white and tallowy, and some persons prefer a higher colour.\r\nThis is communicated by mixing a little finely-powdered arnotto with the\r\ncream before putting it into the churn; a still more, natural and\r\ndelicate colour is communicated by scraping a red carrot into a clean\r\npiece of linen cloth, dipping it into water, and squeezing it into the\r\ncream.\r\n\r\n2367. As soon as the butter comes, the milk is poured off, and the\r\nbutter put into a shallow wooden tub or bowl, full of pure spring water,\r\nin which it is washed and kneaded, pouring off the water, and renewing\r\nit until it comes away perfectly free from milk. Imperfect washing is\r\nthe frequent cause of bad butter, and in nothing is the skill of the\r\ndairy-maid tested more than in this process; moreover, it is one in\r\nwhich cleanliness of habits and person are most necessary. In this\r\noperation we want the aid of Phyllis's neat, soft, and perfectly clean\r\nhand; for no mechanical operation can so well squeeze out the sour\r\nparticles of milk or curd.\r\n\r\n2368. The operations of churning and butter-making over, the butter-milk\r\nis disposed of: usually, in England, it goes to the pigs; but it is a,\r\nvery wholesome beverage when fresh, and some persons like it; the\r\ndisposal, therefore, will rest with the mistress: the dairy-maid's duty\r\nis to get rid of it. She must then scald with boiling water and scrub\r\nout every utensil she has used; brush out the churn, clean out the\r\ncream-jars, which will probably require the use of a little common soda\r\nto purify; wipe all dry, and place them in a position where the sun can\r\nreach them for a short time, to sweeten them.\r\n\r\n    2369. In Devonshire, celebrated for its dairy system, the milk\r\n    is always scalded. The milk-pans, which are of tin, and contain\r\n    from 10 to 12 quarts, after standing 10 or 12 hours, are placed\r\n    on a hot plate of iron, over a stove, until the cream has formed\r\n    on the surface, which is indicated by the air-bubbles rising\r\n    through the milk, and producing blisters on the surface-coating\r\n    of cream. This indicates its approach to the boiling point: and\r\n    the vessel is now removed to cool. When sufficiently, that is,\r\n    quite cool, the cream is skimmed off with the slice: it is now\r\n    the clouted cream for which Devonshire is so famous. It is now\r\n    placed in the churn, and churned until the butter comes, which\r\n    it generally does in a much shorter time than by the other\r\n    process. The butter so made contains more _caseine_ than butter\r\n    made in the usual way, but does not keep so long.\r\n\r\n2370. It is a question frequently discussed, how far it is economical\r\nfor families to keep cows and make their own butter. It is calculated\r\nthat a good cow costs from May 1 to October 1, when well but\r\neconomically kept, £5. 16s. 6d; and from October 1 to April 30, £10. 2s.\r\n6d. During that time she should produce 227 lbs. of butter, besides the\r\nskimmed milk. Of course, if new milk and cream are required, that will\r\ndiminish the quantity of butter.\r\n\r\n2371. Besides churning and keeping her dairy in order, the dairy-maid\r\nhas charge of the whole produce, handing it over to the cook, butler, or\r\nhousemaid as required; and she will do well to keep an exact account\r\nboth of what she receives and how and when she disposes of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE LAUNDRY-MAID.\r\n\r\n2372. The laundry-maid is charged with the duty of washing and\r\ngetting-up the family linen,--a situation of great importance where the\r\nwashing is all done at home; but in large towns, where there is little\r\nconvenience for bleaching and drying, it is chiefly done by professional\r\nlaundresses and companies, who apply mechanical and chemical processes\r\nto the purpose. These processes, however, are supposed to injure the\r\nfabric of the linen; and in many families the fine linen, cottons, and\r\nmuslins, are washed and got-up at home, even where the bulk of the\r\nwashing is given out. In country and suburban houses, where greater\r\nconveniences exist, washing at home is more common,--in country places\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\n2373. The laundry establishment consists of a washing-house, an ironing\r\nand drying-room, and sometimes a drying-closet heated by furnaces. The\r\nwashing-house will probably be attached to the kitchen; but it is better\r\nthat it should be completely detached from it, and of one story, with a\r\nfunnel or shaft to carry off the steam. It will be of a size\r\nproportioned to the extent of the washing to be done. A range of tubs,\r\neither round or oblong, opposite to, and sloping towards, the light,\r\nnarrower at the bottom than the top, for convenience in stooping over,\r\nand fixed at a height suited to the convenience of the women using them;\r\neach tub having a tap for hot and cold water, and another in the bottom,\r\ncommunicating with the drains, for drawing off foul water. A boiler and\r\nfurnace, proportioned in size to the wants of the family, should also be\r\nfixed. The flooring should be York stone, laid on brick piers, with good\r\ndrainage, or asphalte, sloping gently towards a gutter connected with\r\nthe drain.\r\n\r\n2374. Adjoining the bleaching-house, a second room, about the same size,\r\nis required for ironing, drying, and mangling. The contents of this room\r\nshould comprise an ironing-board, opposite to the light; a strong white\r\ndeal table, about twelve or fourteen feet long, and about three and a\r\nhalf feet broad, with drawers for ironing-blankets; a mangle in one\r\ncorner, and clothes-horses for drying and airing; cupboards for holding\r\nthe various irons, starch, and other articles used in ironing; a\r\nhot-plate built in the chimney, with furnace beneath it for heating the\r\nirons; sometimes arranged with a flue for carrying the hot air round the\r\nroom for drying. Where this is the case, however, there should be a\r\nfunnel in the ceiling for ventilation and carrying off steam; but a\r\nbetter arrangement is to have a hot-air closet adjoining, heated by\r\nhot-air pipes, and lined with iron, with proper arrangements for\r\ncarrying off steam, and clothes-horses on castors running in grooves, to\r\nrun into it for drying purposes. This leaves the laundry free from\r\nunwholesome vapour.\r\n\r\n2375. The laundry-maid should commence her labours on Monday morning by\r\na careful examination of the articles committed to her care, and enter\r\nthem in the washing-book; separating the white linen and collars, sheets\r\nand body-linen, into one heap, fine muslins into another, coloured\r\ncotton and linen fabrics into a third, woollens into a fourth, and the\r\ncoarser kitchen and other greasy cloths into a fifth. Every article\r\nshould be examined for ink- or grease-spots, or for fruit- or\r\nwine-stains. Ink-spots are removed by dipping the part into hot water,\r\nand then spreading it smoothly on the hand or on the back of a spoon,\r\npouring a few drops of oxalic acid or salts of sorel over the ink-spot,\r\nrubbing and rinsing it in cold water till removed; grease-spots, by\r\nrubbing over with yellow soap, and rinsing in hot water; fruit- and\r\nwine-spots, by dipping in a solution of sal ammonia or spirits of wine,\r\nand rinsing.\r\n\r\n2376. Every article having been examined and assorted, the sheets and\r\nfine linen should be placed in one of the tubs and just covered with\r\nlukewarm water, in which a little soda has been dissolved and mixed, and\r\nleft there to soak till the morning. The greasy cloths and dirtier\r\nthings should be laid to soak in another tub, in a liquor composed of\r\n1/2 lb. of unslaked lime to every 6 quarts of water which has been\r\nboiled for two hours, then left to settle, and strained off when clear.\r\nEach article should be rinsed in this liquor to wet it thoroughly, and\r\nleft to soak till the morning, just covered by it when the things are\r\npressed together. Coppers and boilers should now be filled, and the\r\nfires laid ready to light.\r\n\r\n2377. Early on the following morning the fires should be lighted, and as\r\nsoon as hot water can be procured, washing commenced; the sheets and\r\nbody-linen being wanted to whiten in the morning, should be taken first;\r\neach article being removed in succession from the lye in which it has\r\nbeen soaking, rinsed, rubbed, and wrung, and laid aside until the tub is\r\nempty, when the foul water is drawn off. The tub should be again filled\r\nwith luke-warm water, about 80°, in which the articles should again be\r\nplunged, and each gone over carefully with soap, and rubbed. Novices in\r\nthe art sometimes rub the linen against the skin; more experienced\r\nwasherwomen rub one linen surface against the other, which saves their\r\nhands, and enables them to continue their labour much longer, besides\r\neconomizing time, two parts being thus cleaned at once.\r\n\r\n2378. After this first washing, the linen should be put into a second\r\nwater as hot as the hand can bear, and again rubbed over in every part,\r\nexamining every part for spots not yet moved, which require to be again\r\nsoaped over and rubbed till thoroughly clean; then rinsed and wrung, the\r\nlarger and stronger articles by two of the women; the smaller and more\r\ndelicate articles requiring gentler treatment.\r\n\r\n2379. In order to remove every particle of soap, and produce a good\r\ncolour, they should now be placed, and boiled for about an hour and a\r\nhalf in the copper, in which soda, in the proportion of a teaspoonful to\r\nevery two gallons of water, has been dissolved. Some very careful\r\nlaundresses put the linen into a canvas bag to protect it from the scum\r\nand the sides of the copper. When taken out, it should again be rinsed,\r\nfirst in clean hot water, and then in abundance of cold water slightly\r\ntinged with fig-blue, and again wrung dry. It should now be removed from\r\nthe washing-house and hung up to dry or spread out to bleach, if there\r\nare conveniences for it; and the earlier in the day this is done, the\r\nclearer and whiter will be the linen.\r\n\r\n2380. Coloured muslins, cottons, and linens, require a milder treatment;\r\nany application of soda will discharge the colour, and soaking all\r\nnight, even in pure water, deteriorates the more delicate tints. When\r\nready for washing, if not too dirty, they should be put into cold water\r\nand washed very speedily, using the common yellow soap, which should be\r\nrinsed off immediately. One article should be washed at a time, and\r\nrinsed out immediately before any others are wetted. When washed\r\nthoroughly, they should be rinsed in succession in soft water, in which\r\ncommon salt has been dissolved, in the proportion of a handful to three\r\nor four gallons, and afterwards wrung gently, as soon as rinsed, with as\r\nlittle twisting as possible, and then hung out to dry. Delicate-coloured\r\narticles should not be exposed to the sun, but dried in the shade, using\r\nclean lines and wooden pegs.\r\n\r\n2381. Woollen articles are liable to shrink, unless the flannel has been\r\nwell shrunk before making up. This liability is increased where very hot\r\nwater is used: cold water would thus be the best to wash woollens in;\r\nbut, as this would not remove the dirt, lukewarm water, about 85°, and\r\nyellow soap, are recommended. When thoroughly washed in this, they\r\nrequire a good deal of rinsing in cold water, to remove the soap.\r\n\r\n2382. Greasy cloths, which have soaked all night in the liquid\r\ndescribed, should be now washed out with soap-and-water as hot as the\r\nhands can bear, first in one water, and rinsed out in a second; and\r\nafterwards boiled for two hours in water in which a little soda is\r\ndissolved. When taken out, they should be rinsed in cold water, and laid\r\nout or hung up to dry.\r\n\r\n2383. Silk handkerchiefs require to be washed alone. When they contain\r\nsnuff, they should be soaked by themselves in lukewarm water two or\r\nthree hours; they should be rinsed out and put to soak with the others\r\nin cold water for an hour or two; then washed in lukewarm water, being\r\nsoaped as they are washed. If this does not remove all stains, they\r\nshould be washed a second time in similar water, and, when finished,\r\nrinsed in soft water in which a handful of common salt has been\r\ndissolved. In washing stuff or woollen dresses, the band at the waist\r\nand the lining at the bottom should be removed, and wherever it is\r\ngathered into folds; and, in furniture, the hems and gatherings. A black\r\nsilk dress, if very dirty, must be washed; but, if only soiled, soaking\r\nfor four-and-twenty hours will do; if old and rusty, a pint of common\r\nspirits should be mixed with each gallon of water, which is an\r\nimprovement under any circumstances. Whether soaked or washed, it should\r\nbe hung up to drain, and dried without wringing.\r\n\r\n2384. Satin and silk ribbons, both white and coloured, may be cleaned in\r\nthe same manner.\r\n\r\n2385. Silks, when washed, should be dried in the shade, on a\r\nlinen-horse, taking care that they are kept smooth and unwrinkled. If\r\nblack or blue, they will be improved if laid again on the table, when\r\ndry, and sponged with gin, or whiskey, or other white spirit.\r\n\r\n2386. The operations should be concluded by rinsing the tubs, cleaning\r\nthe coppers, scrubbing the floors of the washing-house, and restoring\r\neverything to order and cleanliness.\r\n\r\n2387. Thursday and Friday, in a laundry in full employ, are usually\r\ndevoted to mangling, starching, and ironing.\r\n\r\n2388. Linen, cotton, and other fabrics, after being washed and dried,\r\nare made smooth and glossy by mangling and by ironing. The mangling\r\nprocess, which is simply passing them between rollers subjected to a\r\nvery considerable pressure, produced by weight, is confined to sheets,\r\ntowels, table-linen, and similar articles, which are without folds or\r\nplaits. Ironing is necessary to smooth body-linen, and made-up articles\r\nof delicate texture or gathered into folds. The mangle is too well known\r\nto need description.\r\n\r\n    2389. _Ironing_.--The irons consist of the common flat-iron,\r\n    which is of different sizes, varying from 4 to 10 inches in\r\n    length, triangular in form, and from 2-1/2 to 4-1/2 inches in\r\n    width at the broad end; the oval iron, which is used for more\r\n    delicate articles; and the box-iron, which is hollow, and heated\r\n    by a red-hot iron inserted into the box. The Italian iron is a\r\n    hollow tube, smooth on the outside, and raised on a slender\r\n    pedestal with a footstalk. Into the hollow cylinder a red-hot\r\n    iron is pushed, which heats it; and the smooth outside of the\r\n    latter is used, on which articles such as frills, and plaited\r\n    articles, are drawn. Crimping- and gauffering-machines are used\r\n    for a kind of plaiting where much regularity is required, the\r\n    articles being passed through two iron rollers fluted so as to\r\n    represent the kind of plait or fold required.\r\n\r\n2390. Starching is a process by which stiffness is communicated to\r\ncertain parts of linen, as the collar and front of shirts, by dipping\r\nthem in a paste made of starch boiled in water, mixed with a little gum\r\nArabic, where extra stiffness is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE STARCH.\r\n\r\n2391. INGREDIENTS.--Allow 1/2 pint of cold water and 1 quart of boiling\r\nwater to every 2 tablespoonfuls of starch.\r\n\r\n_Mode_.--Put the starch into a tolerably large basin; pour over it the\r\ncold water, and stir the mixture well with a wooden spoon until it is\r\nperfectly free from lumps, and quite smooth. Then take the basin to the\r\nfire, and whilst the water is _actually boiling_ in the kettle or\r\nboiler, pour it over the starch, stirring it the whole time. If made\r\nproperly in this manner, the starch will require no further boiling; but\r\nshould the water not be boiling when added to the starch, it will not\r\nthicken, and must be put into a clean saucepan, and stirred over the\r\nfire until it boils. Take it off the fire, strain it into a clean basin,\r\ncover it up to prevent a skin forming on the top, and, when sufficiently\r\ncool that the hand may be borne in it, starch the things. Many persons,\r\nto give a shiny and smooth appearance to the linen when ironed, stir\r\nround two or three times in the starch a piece of wax candle, which also\r\nprevents the iron from sticking.\r\n\r\n2392. When the \"things to be starched\" are washed, dried, and taken off\r\nthe lines, they should be dipped into the hot starch made as directed,\r\nsqueezed out of it, and then just dipped into cold water, and\r\nimmediately squeezed dry. If fine things be wrung, or roughly used, they\r\nare very liable to tear; so too much care cannot be exercised in this\r\nrespect. If the article is lace, clap it between the hands a few times,\r\nwhich will assist to clear it; then have ready laid out on the table a\r\nlarge clean towel or cloth; shake out the starched things, lay them on\r\nthe cloth, and roll it up tightly, and let it remain for three or fours,\r\nwhen the things will be ready to iron.\r\n\r\n2393. To be able to iron properly requires much practice and experience.\r\nStrict cleanliness with all the ironing utensils must be observed, as,\r\nif this is not the case, not the most expert ironer will be able to make\r\nher things look clear and free from smears, &c. After wiping down her\r\nironing table, the laundry-maid should place a coarse cloth on it, and\r\nover that the ironing-blanket, with her stand and iron-rubber; and\r\nhaving ascertained that her irons are quite clean and of the right heat,\r\nshe proceeds with her work.\r\n\r\n2394. It is a good plan to try the heat of the iron on a coarse cloth or\r\napron before ironing anything fine: there is then no danger of\r\nscorching. For ironing fine things, such as collars, cuffs, muslins, and\r\nlaces, there is nothing so clean and nice to use as the box-iron; the\r\nbottom being bright, and never placed near the fire, it is always\r\nperfectly clean; it should, however, be kept in a dry place, for fear of\r\nits rusting. Gauffering-tongs or irons must be placed in a clear fire\r\nfor a minute, then withdrawn, wiped with a coarse rubber, and the heat\r\nof them tried on a piece of paper, as, unless great care is taken, these\r\nwill very soon scorch.\r\n\r\n2395. The skirts of muslin dresses should be ironed on a skirt-board\r\ncovered with flannel, and the fronts of shirts on a smaller board, also\r\ncovered with flannel; this board being placed between the back and\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n2396. After things are mangled, they should also be ironed in the folds\r\nand gathers; dinner-napkins smoothed over, as also table-cloths,\r\npillow-cases, and sometimes sheets. The bands of flannel petticoats, and\r\nshoulder-straps to flannel waistcoats, must also undergo the same\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPPER AND UNDER NURSEMAIDS.\r\n\r\n2397. The nursery is of great importance in every family, and in\r\nfamilies of distinction, where there are several young children, it is\r\nan establishment kept apart from the rest of the family, under the\r\ncharge of an upper nurse, assisted by under nursery-maids proportioned\r\nto the work to be done. The responsible duties of upper nursemaid\r\ncommence with the weaning of the child: it must now be separated from\r\nthe mother or wet-nurse, at least for a time, and the cares of the\r\nnursemaid, which have hitherto been only occasionally put in\r\nrequisition, are now to be entirely devoted to the infant. She washes,\r\ndresses, and feeds it; walks out with it, and regulates all its little\r\nwants; and, even at this early age, many good qualities are required to\r\ndo so in a satisfactory manner. Patience and good temper are\r\nindispensable qualities; truthfulness, purity of manners, minute\r\ncleanliness, and docility and obedience, almost equally so. She ought\r\nalso to be acquainted with the art of ironing and trimming little caps,\r\nand be handy with her needle.\r\n\r\n    2398. There is a considerable art in carrying an infant\r\n    comfortably for itself and for the nursemaid. If she carry it\r\n    always seated upright on her arm, and presses it too closely\r\n    against her chest, the stomach of the child is apt to get\r\n    compressed, and the back fatigued. For her own comfort, a good\r\n    nurse will frequently vary this position, by changing from one\r\n    arm to the other, and sometimes by laying it across both,\r\n    raising the head a little. When teaching it to walk, and guiding\r\n    it by the hand, she should change the hand from time to time, so\r\n    as to avoid raising one shoulder higher than the other. This is\r\n    the only way in which a child should be taught to walk;\r\n    leading-strings and other foolish inventions, which force an\r\n    infant to make efforts, with its shoulders and head forward,\r\n    before it knows how to use its limbs, will only render it\r\n    feeble, and retard its progress.\r\n\r\n    2399. Most children have some bad habit, of which they must be\r\n    broken; but this is never accomplished by harshness without\r\n    developing worse evils: kindness, perseverance, and patience in\r\n    the nurse, are here of the utmost importance. When\r\n    finger-sucking is one of these habits, the fingers are sometimes\r\n    rubbed with bitter aloes, or some equally disagreeable\r\n    substance. Others have dirty habits, which are only to be\r\n    changed by patience, perseverance, and, above all, by regularity\r\n    in the nurse. She should never be permitted to inflict\r\n    punishment on these occasions, or, indeed, on any occasion. But,\r\n    if punishment is to be avoided, it is still more necessary that\r\n    all kinds of indulgences and flattery be equally forbidden.\r\n    Yielding to all the whims of a child,--picking up its toys when\r\n    thrown away in mere wantonness, would be intolerable. A child\r\n    should never be led to think others inferior to it, to beat a\r\n    dog, or even the stone against which it falls, as some children\r\n    are taught to do by silly nurses. Neither should the nurse\r\n    affect or show alarm at any of the little accidents which must\r\n    inevitably happen: if it falls, treat it as a trifle; otherwise\r\n    she encourages a spirit of cowardice and timidity. But she will\r\n    take care that such accidents are not of frequent occurrence, or\r\n    the result of neglect.\r\n\r\n    2400. The nurse should keep the child as clean as possible, and\r\n    particularly she should train it to habits of cleanliness, so\r\n    that it should feel uncomfortable when otherwise; watching\r\n    especially that it does not soil itself in eating. At the same\r\n    time, vanity in its personal appearance is not to be encouraged\r\n    by over-care in this respect, or by too tight lacing or\r\n    buttoning of dresses, nor a small foot cultivated by the use of\r\n    tight shoes.\r\n\r\n    2401. Nursemaids would do well to repeat to the parents\r\n    faithfully and truly the defects they observe in the\r\n    dispositions of very young children. If properly checked in\r\n    time, evil propensities may be eradicated; but this should not\r\n    extend to anything but serious defects; otherwise, the intuitive\r\n    perceptions which all children possess will construe the act\r\n    into \"spying\" and \"informing,\" which should never be resorted to\r\n    in the case of children, nor, indeed, in any case.\r\n\r\n2402. Such are the cares which devolve upon the nursemaid, and it is her\r\nduty to fulfil them personally. In large establishments she will have\r\nassistants proportioned to the number of children of which she has the\r\ncare. The under nursemaid lights the fires, sweeps, scours, and dusts\r\nthe rooms, and makes the beds; empties slops, and carries up water;\r\nbrings up and removes the nursery meals; washes and dresses all the\r\nchildren, except the infant, and assists in mending. Where there is a\r\nnursery girl to assist, she does the rougher part of the cleaning; and\r\nall take their meals in the nursery together, after the children of the\r\nfamily have done.\r\n\r\n2403. In smaller families, where there is only one nursemaid kept, she\r\nis assisted by the housemaid, or servant-of-all-work, who will do the\r\nrougher part of the work, and carry up the nursery meals. In such\r\ncircumstances she will be more immediately under the eye of her\r\nmistress, who will probably relieve her from some of the cares of the\r\ninfant. In higher families, the upper nurse is usually permitted to sup\r\nor dine occasionally at the housekeeper's table by way of relaxation,\r\nwhen the children are all well, and her subordinates trustworthy.\r\n\r\n2404. Where the nurse has the entire charge of the nursery, and the\r\nmother is too much occupied to do more than pay a daily visit to it, it\r\nis desirable that she be a person of observation, and possess some\r\nacquaintance with the diseases incident to childhood, as also with such\r\nsimple remedies as may be useful before a medical attendant can be\r\nprocured, or where such attendance is not considered necessary. All\r\nthese little ailments are preceded by symptoms so minute as to be only\r\nperceptible to close observation; such as twitching of the brows,\r\nrestless sleep, grinding the gums, and, in some inflammatory diseases,\r\neven to the child abstaining from crying, from fear of the increased\r\npain produced by the movement. Dentition, or cutting the teeth, is\r\nattended with many of these symptoms. Measles, thrush, scarlatina,\r\ncroup, hooping-cough, and other childish complaints, are all preceded by\r\nwell-known symptoms, which may be alleviated and rendered less virulent\r\nby simple remedies instantaneously applied.\r\n\r\n2405. _Dentition_ is usually the first serious trouble, bringing many\r\nother disorders in its train. The symptoms are most perceptible to the\r\nmother: the child sucks feebly, and with gums hot, inflamed, and\r\nswollen. In this case, relief is yielded by rubbing them from time to\r\ntime with a little of Mrs. Johnson's soothing syrup, a valuable and\r\nperfectly safe medicine. Selfish and thoughtless nurses, and mothers\r\ntoo, sometimes give cordials and sleeping-draughts, whose effects are\r\ntoo well known.\r\n\r\n2406. _Convulsion Fits_ sometimes follow the feverish restlessness\r\nproduced by these causes; in which case a hot bath should be\r\nadministered without delay, and the lower parts of the body rubbed, the\r\nbath being as hot as it can be without scalding the tender skin; at the\r\nsame time, the doctor should be sent for immediately, for no nurse\r\nshould administer medicine in this case, unless the fits have been\r\nrepeated and the doctor has left directions with her how to act.\r\n\r\n2407. _Croup_ is one of the most alarming diseases of childhood; it is\r\naccompanied with a hoarse, croaking, ringing cough, and comes on very\r\nsuddenly, and most so in strong, robust children. A very hot bath should\r\nbe instantly administered, followed by an emetic, either in the form of\r\ntartar-emetic, croup-powder, or a teaspoonful of ipecacuanha, wrapping\r\nthe body warmly up in flannel after the bath. The slightest delay in\r\nadministering the bath, or the emetic, may be fatal; hence, the\r\nimportance of nurses about very young children being acquainted with the\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\n2408. _Hooping-Cough_ is generally preceded by the moaning noise during\r\nsleep, which even adults threatened with the disorder cannot avoid: it\r\nis followed by violent fits of coughing, which little can be done to\r\nrelieve. A child attacked by this disorder should be kept as much as\r\npossible in the fresh, pure air, but out of draughts, and kept warm, and\r\nsupplied with plenty of nourishing food. Many fatal diseases flow from\r\nthis scourge of childhood, and a change to purer air, if possible,\r\nshould follow convalescence.\r\n\r\n2409. _Worms_ are the torment of some children: the symptoms are, an\r\nunnatural craving for food, even after a full meal; costiveness,\r\nsuddenly followed by the reverse; fetid breath, a livid circle under the\r\neyes, enlarged abdomen, and picking the nose; for which the remedies\r\nmust be prescribed by the doctor.\r\n\r\n2410. _Measles_ and _Scarlatina_ much resemble each other in their early\r\nstages: headache, restlessness, and fretfulness are the symptoms of\r\nboth. Shivering fits, succeeded by a hot skin; pains in the back and\r\nlimbs, accompanied by sickness, and, in severe cases, sore throat; pain\r\nabout the jaws, difficulty in swallowing, running at the eyes, which\r\nbecome red and inflamed, while the face is hot and flushed, often\r\ndistinguish scarlatina and scarlet fever, of which it is only a mild\r\nform.\r\n\r\n2411. While the case is doubtful, a dessert-spoonful of spirit of nitre\r\ndiluted in water, given at bedtime, will throw the child into a gentle\r\nperspiration, and will bring out the rash in either case. In measles,\r\nthis appears first on the face; in scarlatina, on the chest; and in both\r\ncases a doctor should be called in. In scarlatina, tartar-emetic powder\r\nor ipecacuanha may be administered in the mean time.\r\n\r\n2412. In all cases, cleanliness, fresh air, clean utensils, and frequent\r\nwashing of the person, both of nurse and children, are even more\r\nnecessary in the nursery than in either drawing-room or sick-room,\r\ninasmuch as the delicate organs of childhood are more susceptible of\r\ninjury from smells and vapours than adults.\r\n\r\n2413. It may not be out of place if we conclude this brief notice of the\r\nduties of a nursemaid, by an extract from Florence Nightingale's\r\nadmirable \"Notes on Nursing.\" Referring to children, she says:--\r\n\r\n    2414. \"They are much more susceptible than grown people to all\r\n    noxious influences. They are affected by the same things, but\r\n    much more quickly and seriously; by want of fresh air, of proper\r\n    warmth; want of cleanliness in house, clothes, bedding, or body;\r\n    by improper food, want of punctuality, by dulness, by want of\r\n    light, by too much or too little covering in bed or when up.\"\r\n    And all this in health; and then she quotes a passage from a\r\n    lecture on sudden deaths in infancy, to show the importance of\r\n    careful nursing of children:--\"In the great majority of\r\n    instances, when death suddenly befalls the infant or young\r\n    child, it is an _accident_; it is not a necessary, inevitable\r\n    result of any disease. That which is known to injure children\r\n    most seriously is foul air; keeping the rooms where they sleep\r\n    closely shut up is destruction to them; and, if the child's\r\n    breathing be disordered by disease, a few hours only of such\r\n    foul air may endanger its life, even where no inconvenience is\r\n    felt by grown-up persons in the room.\"\r\n\r\n    2415. Persons moving in the beat society will see, after\r\n    perusing Miss Nightingale's book, that this \"foul air,\" \"want of\r\n    light,\" \"too much or too little clothing,\" and improper food, is\r\n    not confined to Crown Street or St. Giles's; that Belgravia and\r\n    the squares have their north room, where the rays of the sun\r\n    never reach. \"A wooden bedstead, two or three mattresses piled\r\n    up to above the height of the table, a vallance attached to the\r\n    frame,--nothing but a miracle could ever thoroughly dry or air\r\n    such a bed and bedding,\"--is the ordinary bed of a private\r\n    house, than which nothing can be more unwholesome. \"Don't treat\r\n    your children like sick,\" she sums up; \"don't dose them with\r\n    tea. Let them eat meat and drink milk, or half a glass of light\r\n    beer. Give them fresh, light, sunny, and open rooms, cool\r\n    bedrooms, plenty of outdoor exercise, facing even the cold, and\r\n    wind, and weather, in sufficiently warm clothes, and with\r\n    sufficient exercise, plenty of amusements and play; more\r\n    liberty, and less schooling, and cramming, and training; more\r\n    attention to food and less to physic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE SICK-NURSE.\r\n\r\n2416. All women are likely, at some period of their lives, to be called\r\non to perform the duties of a sick-nurse, and should prepare themselves\r\nas much as possible, by observation and reading, for the occasion when\r\nthey may be required to perform the office. The main requirements are\r\ngood temper, compassion for suffering, sympathy with sufferers, which\r\nmost women worthy of the name possess, neat-handedness, quiet manners,\r\nlove of order, and cleanliness. With these qualifications there will be\r\nvery little to be wished for; the desire to relieve suffering will\r\ninspire a thousand little attentions, and surmount the disgusts which\r\nsome of the offices attending the sick-room are apt to create. Where\r\nserious illness visits a household, and protracted nursing is likely to\r\nbecome necessary, a professional nurse will probably be engaged, who has\r\nbeen trained to its duties; but in some families, and those not a few\r\nlet us hope, the ladies of the family would oppose such an arrangement\r\nas a failure of duty on their part. There is, besides, even when a\r\nprofessional nurse is ultimately called in, a period of doubt and\r\nhesitation, while disease has not yet developed itself, when the patient\r\nmust be attended to; and, in these cases, some of the female servants of\r\nthe establishment must give their attendance in the sick-room. There\r\nare, also, slight attacks of cold, influenza, and accidents in a\r\nthousand forms, to which all are subject, where domestic nursing becomes\r\na necessity; where disease, though unattended with danger, is\r\nnevertheless accompanied by the nervous irritation incident to illness,\r\nand when all the attention of the domestic nurse becomes necessary.\r\n\r\n2417. In the first stage of sickness, while doubt and a little\r\nperplexity hang over the household as to the nature of the sickness,\r\nthere are some things about which no doubt can exist: the patient's room\r\nmust be kept in a perfectly pure state, and arrangements made for proper\r\nattendance; for the first canon of nursing, according to Florence\r\nNightingale, its apostle, is to \"keep the air the patient breathes as\r\npure as the external air, without chilling him.\" This can be done\r\nwithout any preparation which might alarm the patient; with proper\r\nwindows, open fireplaces, and a supply of fuel, the room may be as fresh\r\nas it is outside, and kept at a temperature suitable for the patient's\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n2418. Windows, however, must be opened from above, and not from below,\r\nand draughts avoided; cool air admitted beneath the patient's head\r\nchills the lower strata and the floor. The careful nurse will keep the\r\ndoor shut when the window is open; she will also take care that the\r\npatient is not placed between the door and the open window, nor between\r\nthe open fireplace and the window. If confined to bed, she will see that\r\nthe bed is placed in a thoroughly ventilated part of the room, but out\r\nof the current of air which is produced by the momentary opening of\r\ndoors, as well as out of the line of draught between the window and the\r\nopen chimney, and that the temperature of the room is kept about 64°.\r\nWhere it is necessary to admit air by the door, the windows should be\r\nclosed; but there are few circumstances in which good air can be\r\nobtained through the chamber-door; through it, on the contrary, the\r\ngases generated in the lower parts of the house are likely to be drawn\r\ninto the invalid chamber.\r\n\r\n2419. These precautions taken, and plain nourishing diet, such as the\r\npatient desires, furnished, probably little more can be done, unless\r\nmore serious symptoms present themselves; in which case medical advice\r\nwill be sought.\r\n\r\n2420. Under no circumstances is ventilation of the sick-room so\r\nessential as in cases of febrile diseases, usually considered\r\ninfectious; such as typhus and puerperal fevers, influenza,\r\nhooping-cough, small- and chicken-pox, scarlet fever, measles, and\r\nerysipelas: all these are considered communicable through the air; but\r\nthere is little danger of infection being thus communicated, provided\r\nthe room is kept thoroughly ventilated. On the contrary, if this\r\nessential be neglected, the power of infection is greatly increased and\r\nconcentrated in the confined and impure air; it settles upon the clothes\r\nof the attendants and visitors, especially where they are of wool, and\r\nis frequently communicated to other families in this manner.\r\n\r\n2421. Under all circumstances, therefore, the sick-room should be kept\r\nas fresh and sweet as the open air, while the temperature is kept up by\r\nartificial heat, taking care that the fire burns clear, and gives out no\r\nsmoke into the room; that the room is perfectly clean, wiped over with a\r\ndamp cloth every day, if boarded; and swept, after sprinkling with damp\r\ntea-leaves, or other aromatic leaves, if carpeted; that all utensils are\r\nemptied and cleaned as soon as used, and not once in four-and-twenty\r\nhours, as is sometimes done. \"A slop-pail,\" Miss Nightingale says,\r\n\"should never enter a sick-room; everything should be carried direct to\r\nthe water-closet, emptied there, and brought up clean; in the best\r\nhospitals the slop-pail is unknown.\" \"I do not approve,\" says Miss\r\nNightingale, \"of making housemaids of nurses,--that would be waste of\r\nmeans; but I have seen surgical sisters, women whose hands were worth to\r\nthem two or three guineas a week, down on their knees, scouring a room\r\nor hut, because they thought it was not fit for their patients: these\r\nwomen had the true nurse spirit.\"\r\n\r\n2422. Bad smells are sometimes met by sprinkling a little liquid\r\nchloride of lime on the floor; fumigation by burning pastiles is also a\r\ncommon expedient for the purification of the sick-room. They are useful,\r\nbut only in the sense hinted at by the medical lecturer, who commenced\r\nhis lecture thus:--\"Fumigations, gentlemen, are of essential importance;\r\nthey make so abominable a smell, that they compel you to open the\r\nwindows and admit fresh air.\" In this sense they are useful, but\r\nineffectual unless the cause be removed, and fresh air admitted.\r\n\r\n2423. The sick-room should be quiet; no talking, no gossiping, and,\r\nabove all, no whispering,--this is absolute cruelty to the patient; he\r\nthinks his complaint the subject, and strains his ear painfully to catch\r\nthe sound. No rustling of dresses, nor creaking shoes either; where the\r\ncarpets are taken up, the nurse should wear list shoes, or some other\r\nnoiseless material, and her dress should be of soft material that does\r\nnot rustle. Miss Nightingale denounces crinoline, and quotes Lord\r\nMelbourne on the subject of women in the sick-room, who said, \"I would\r\nrather have men about me, when ill, than women; it requires very strong\r\nhealth to put up with women.\" Ungrateful man! but absolute quiet is\r\nnecessary in the sick-room.\r\n\r\n2424. Never let the patient be waked out of his first sleep by noise,\r\nnever roused by anything like a surprise. Always sit in the apartment,\r\nso that the patient has you in view, and that it is not necessary for\r\nhim to turn in speaking to you. Never keep a patient standing; never\r\nspeak to one while moving. Never lean on the sick-bed. Above all, be\r\ncalm and decisive with the patient, and prevent all noises over-head.\r\n\r\n2425. A careful nurse, when a patient leaves his bed, will open the\r\nsheets wide, and throw the clothes back so as thoroughly to air the bed;\r\nShe will avoid drying or airing anything damp in the sick-room.\r\n\r\n2426. \"It is another fallacy,\" says Florence Nightingale, \"to suppose\r\nthat night air is injurious; a great authority told me that, in London,\r\nthe air is never so good as after ten o'clock, when smoke has\r\ndiminished; but then it must be air from without, not within, and not\r\nair vitiated by gaseous airs.\" \"A great fallacy prevails also,\" she\r\nsays, in another section, \"about flowers poisoning the air of the\r\nsick-room: no one ever saw them over-crowding the sick-room; but, if\r\nthey did, they actually absorb carbonic acid and give off oxygen.\" Cut\r\nflowers also decompose water, and produce oxygen gas. Lilies, and some\r\nother very odorous plants, may perhaps give out smells unsuited to a\r\nclose room, while the atmosphere of the sick-room should always be fresh\r\nand natural.\r\n\r\n2427. \"Patients,\" says Miss Nightingale, \"are sometimes starved in the\r\nmidst of plenty, from want of attention to the ways which alone make it\r\npossible for them to take food. A spoonful of beef-tea, or arrowroot and\r\nwine, or some other light nourishing diet, should be given every hour,\r\nfor the patient's stomach will reject large supplies. In very weak\r\npatients there is often a nervous difficulty in swallowing, which is\r\nmuch increased if food is not ready and presented at the moment when it\r\nis wanted: the nurse should be able to discriminate, and know when this\r\nmoment is approaching.\"\r\n\r\n2428. Diet suitable for patients will depend, in some degree, on their\r\nnatural likes and dislikes, which the nurse will do well to acquaint\r\nherself with. Beef-tea is useful and relishing, but possesses little\r\nnourishment; when evaporated, it presents a teaspoonful of solid meat to\r\na pint of water. Eggs are not equivalent to the same weight of meat.\r\nArrowroot is less nourishing than flour. Butter is the lightest and most\r\ndigestible kind of fat. Cream, in some diseases, cannot be replaced.\r\nBut, to sum up with some of Miss Nightingale's useful maxims:--Observation\r\nis the nurse's best guide, and the patient's appetite the rule. Half a\r\npint of milk is equal to a quarter of a pound of meat. Beef-tea is the\r\nleast nourishing food administered to the sick; and tea and coffee, she\r\nthinks, are both too much excluded from the sick-room.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONTHLY NURSE.\r\n\r\n2429. The choice of a monthly nurse is of the utmost importance; and in\r\nthe case of a young mother with her first child, it would be well for\r\nher to seek advice and counsel from her more experienced relatives in\r\nthis matter. In the first place, the engaging a monthly nurse in good\r\ntime is of the utmost importance, as, if she be competent and clever,\r\nher services will be sought months beforehand; a good nurse having\r\nseldom much of her time disengaged. There are some qualifications which\r\nit is evident the nurse should possess: she should be scrupulously clean\r\nand tidy in her person; honest, sober, and noiseless in her movements;\r\nshould possess a natural love for children, and have a strong nerve in\r\ncase of emergencies. Snuff-taking and spirit-drinking must not be\r\nincluded in her habits; but these are happily much less frequent than\r\nthey were in former days.\r\n\r\n2430. Receiving, as she often will, instructions from the doctor, she\r\nshould bear these in mind, and carefully carry them out. In those\r\ninstances where she does not feel herself sufficiently informed, she\r\nshould ask advice from the medical man, and not take upon herself to\r\nadminister medicines, &c., without his knowledge.\r\n\r\n2431. A monthly nurse should be between 30 and 50 years of age,\r\nsufficiently old to have had a little experience, and yet not too old or\r\ninfirm to be able to perform various duties requiring strength and\r\nbodily vigour. She should be able to wake the moment she is called,--at\r\nany hour of the night, that the mother or child may have their wants\r\nimmediately attended to. Good temper, united to a kind and gentle\r\ndisposition, is indispensable; and, although the nurse will frequently\r\nhave much to endure from the whims and caprices of the invalid, she\r\nshould make allowances for these, and command her temper, at the same\r\ntime exerting her authority when it is necessary.\r\n\r\n2432. What the nurse has to do in the way of cleaning and dusting her\r\nlady's room, depends entirely on the establishment that is kept. Where\r\nthere are plenty of servants, the nurse, of course, has nothing whatever\r\nto do but attend on her patient, and ring the bell for anything she may\r\nrequire. Where the number of domestics is limited, she should not mind\r\nkeeping her room in order; that is to say, sweeping and dusting it every\r\nmorning. If fires be necessary, the housemaid should always clean the\r\ngrate, and do all that is wanted in that way, as this, being rather\r\ndirty work, would soil the nurse's dress, and unfit her to approach the\r\nbed, or take the infant without soiling its clothes. In small\r\nestablishments, too, the nurse should herself fetch things she may\r\nrequire, and not ring every time she wants anything; and she must, of\r\ncourse, not leave her invalid unless she sees everything is comfortable;\r\nand then only for a few minutes. When down stairs, and in company with\r\nthe other servants, the nurse should not repeat what she may have heard\r\nin her lady's room, as much mischief may be done by a gossiping nurse.\r\nAs in most houses the monthly nurse is usually sent for a few days\r\nbefore her services may be required, she should see that all is in\r\nreadiness; that there be no bustle and hurry at the time the confinement\r\ntakes place. She should keep two pairs of sheets thoroughly aired, as\r\nwell as night-dresses, flannels, &c. &c. All the things which will be\r\nrequired to dress the baby the first time should be laid in the basket\r\nin readiness, in the order in which they are to be put on; as well as\r\nscissors, thread, a few pieces of soft linen rag, and two or three\r\nflannel squares. If a berceaunette is to be used immediately, the nurse\r\nshould ascertain that the mattresses, pillow, &c. are all well aired;\r\nand if not already done before she arrives, she should assist in\r\ncovering and trimming it, ready for the little occupant. A monthly nurse\r\nshould be handy at her needle, as, if she is in the house some time\r\nbefore the baby is born, she will require some work of this sort; to\r\noccupy her time. She should also understand the making-up of little\r\ncaps, although we can scarcely say this is one of the nurse's duties. As\r\nmost children wear no caps, except out of doors, her powers in this way\r\nwill not be much taxed.\r\n\r\n2433. A nurse should endeavour to make her room as cheerful as possible,\r\nand always keep it clean and tidy. She should empty the chamber utensils\r\nas soon as used, and on no account put things under the bed. Soiled\r\nbaby's napkins should be rolled up and put into a pan, when they should\r\nbe washed out every morning, and hung out to dry: they are then in a fit\r\nstate to send to the laundress; and should, on no account, be left\r\ndirty, but done every morning in this way. The bedroom should be kept\r\nrather dark, particularly for the first week or ten days; of a regular\r\ntemperature, and as free as possible from draughts, at the same time\r\nwell ventilated and free from unpleasant smells.\r\n\r\n2434. The infant during the month must not be exposed to strong light,\r\nor much air; and in carrying it about the passages, stairs, &c., the\r\nnurse should always have its head-flannel on, to protect the eyes and\r\nears from the currents of air. For the management of children, we must\r\nrefer our readers to the following chapters; and we need only say, in\r\nconclusion, that a good nurse should understand the symptoms of various\r\nills incident to this period, as, in all cases, prevention is better\r\nthan cure. As young mothers with their first baby are very often much\r\ntroubled at first with their breasts, the nurse should understand the\r\nart of emptying them by suction, or some other contrivance. If the\r\nbreasts are kept well drawn, there will be but little danger of\r\ninflammation; and as the infant at first cannot take all that is\r\nnecessary, something must be done to keep the inflammation down. This is\r\none of the greatest difficulties a nurse has to contend with, and we can\r\nonly advise her to be very persevering, to rub the breasts well, and to\r\nlet the infant suck as soon and as often as possible, until they get in\r\nproper order.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WET-NURSE.\r\n\r\n2435. We are aware that, according to the opinion of some ladies, there\r\nis no domestic theme, during a certain period of their married lives,\r\nmore fraught with vexation and disquietude than that ever-fruitful\r\nsource of annoyance, \"the Nurse;\" but, as we believe, there are\r\nthousands of excellent wives and mothers who pass through life without\r\neven a temporary embroglio in the kitchen, or suffering a state of moral\r\nhectic the whole time of a nurse's empire in the nursery or bedroom. Our\r\nown experience goes to prove, that although many unqualified persons\r\npalm themselves off on ladies as fully competent for the duties they so\r\nrashly and dishonestly undertake to perform, and thus expose themselves\r\nto ill-will and merited censure, there are still very many fully equal\r\nto the legitimate exercise of what they undertake; and if they do not in\r\nevery case give entire satisfaction, some of the fault,--and sometimes a\r\ngreat deal of it,--may be honestly placed to the account of the ladies\r\nthemselves, who, in many instances, are so impressed with the propriety\r\nof their own method of performing everything, as to insist upon the\r\nadoption of _their_ system in preference to that of the nurse, whose\r\nplan is probably based on a comprehensive forethought, and rendered\r\nperfect in all its details by an ample experience.\r\n\r\n2436. In all our remarks on this subject, we should remember with\r\ngentleness the order of society from which our nurses are drawn; and\r\nthat those who make their duty a study, and are termed professional\r\nnurses, have much to endure from the caprice and egotism of their\r\nemployers; while others are driven to the occupation from the laudable\r\nmotive of feeding their own children, and who, in fulfilling that\r\nobject, are too often both selfish and sensual, performing, without\r\nfurther interest than is consistent with their own advantage, the\r\nroutine of customary duties.\r\n\r\n2437. Properly speaking, there are two nurses,--the nurse for the mother\r\nand the nurse for the child, or, the monthly and the wet nurse. Of the\r\nformer we have already spoken, and will now proceed to describe the\r\nduties of the latter, and add some suggestions as to her age, physical\r\nhealth, and moral conduct, subjects of the utmost importance as far as\r\nthe charge intrusted to her is concerned, and therefore demanding some\r\nspecial remarks.\r\n\r\n2438. When from illness, suppression of the milk, accident, or some\r\nnatural process, the mother is deprived of the pleasure of rearing her\r\ninfant, it becomes necessary at once to look around for a fitting\r\nsubstitute, so that the child may not suffer, by any needless delay, a\r\nphysical loss by the deprivation of its natural food. The first\r\nconsideration should be as regards age, state of health, and temper.\r\n\r\n2439. The age, if possible, should not be less than twenty nor exceed\r\nthirty years, with the health sound in every respect, and the body free\r\nfrom all eruptive disease or local blemish. The best evidence of a sound\r\nstate of health will be found in the woman's clear open countenance, the\r\nruddy tone of the skin, the full, round, and elastic state of the\r\nbreasts, and especially in the erectile, firm condition of the nipple,\r\nwhich, in all unhealthy states of the body, is pendulous, flabby, and\r\nrelaxed; in which case, the milk is sure to be imperfect in its\r\norganization, and, consequently, deficient in its nutrient qualities.\r\nAppetite is another indication of health in the suckling nurse or\r\nmother; for it is impossible a woman can feed her child without having a\r\ncorresponding appetite; and though inordinate craving for food is\r\nneither desirable nor necessary, a natural vigour should be experienced\r\nat meal-times, and the food taken should be anticipated and enjoyed.\r\n\r\n2440. Besides her health, the moral state of the nurse is to be taken\r\ninto account, or that mental discipline or principle of conduct which\r\nwould deter the nurse from at any time gratifying her own pleasures and\r\nappetites at the cost or suffering of her infant charge.\r\n\r\n2441. The conscientiousness and good faith that would prevent a nurse so\r\nacting are, unfortunately, very rare; and many nurses, rather than\r\nforego the enjoyment of a favourite dish, though morally certain of the\r\neffect it will have on the child, will, on the first opportunity, feed\r\nwith avidity on fried meats, cabbage, cucumbers, pickles, or other crude\r\nand injurious aliments, in defiance of all orders given, or confidence\r\nreposed in their word, good sense, and humanity. And when the infant is\r\nafterwards racked with pain, and a night of disquiet alarms the mother,\r\nthe doctor is sent for, and the nurse, covering her dereliction by a\r\nfalsehood, the consequence of her gluttony is treated as a disease, and\r\nthe poor infant is dosed for some days with medicines, that can do it\r\nbut little if any good, and, in all probability, materially retard its\r\nphysical development. The selfish nurse, in her ignorance, believes,\r\ntoo, that as long as she experiences no admonitory symptoms herself, the\r\nchild cannot suffer; and satisfied that, whatever is the cause of its\r\nscreams and plunges, neither she, nor what she had eaten, had anything\r\nto do with it, with this flattering assurance at her heart, she watches\r\nher opportunity, and has another luxurious feast off the proscribed\r\ndainties, till the increasing disturbance in the child's health, or\r\ntreachery from the kitchen, opens the eyes of mother and doctor to the\r\nnurse's unprincipled conduct. In all such cases the infant should be\r\nspared the infliction of medicine, and, as a wholesome corrective to\r\nherself, and relief to her charge, a good sound dose administered to the\r\nnurse.\r\n\r\n2442. Respecting the diet of the wet-nurse, the first point of\r\nimportance is to fix early and definite hours for every meal; and the\r\nmother should see that no cause is ever allowed to interfere with their\r\npunctuality. The food itself should be light, easy of digestion, and\r\nsimple. Boiled or roast meat, with bread and potatoes, with occasionally\r\na piece of sago, rice, or tapioca pudding, should constitute the dinner,\r\nthe only meal that requires special comment; broths, green vegetables,\r\nand all acid or salt foods, must be avoided. Fresh fish, once or twice a\r\nweek, may be taken; but it is hardly sufficiently nutritious to be often\r\nused as a meal. If the dinner is taken early,--at one o'clock,--there\r\nwill be no occasion for luncheon, which too often, to the injury of the\r\nchild, is made the cover for a first dinner. Half a pint of stout, with\r\na Reading biscuit, at eleven o'clock, will be abundantly sufficient\r\nbetween breakfast at eight and a good dinner, with a pint of porter at\r\none o'clock. About eight o'clock in the evening, half a pint of stout,\r\nwith another biscuit, may be taken; and for supper, at ten or half-past,\r\na pint of porter, with a slice of toast or a small amount of bread and\r\ncheese, may conclude the feeding for the day.\r\n\r\n2443. Animal food once in twenty-four hours is quite sufficient. All\r\nspirits, unless in extreme cases, should be avoided; and wine is still\r\nmore seldom needed. With a due quantity of plain digestible food, and\r\nthe proportion of stout and porter ordered, with early hours and\r\nregularity, the nurse will not only be strong and healthy herself, but\r\nfully capable of rearing a child in health and strength. There are two\r\npoints all mothers, who are obliged to employ wet-nurses, should\r\nremember, and be on their guard against. The first is, never to allow a\r\nnurse to give medicine to the infant on her own authority: many have\r\nsuch an infatuated idea of the _healing excellence_ of castor-oil, that\r\nthey would administer a dose of this disgusting grease twice a week, and\r\nthink they had done a meritorious service to the child. The next point\r\nis, to watch carefully, lest, to insure a night's sleep for herself, she\r\ndoes not dose the infant with Godfrey's cordial, syrup of poppies, or\r\nsome narcotic potion, to insure tranquillity to the one and give the\r\nopportunity of sleep to the other. The fact that scores of nurses keep\r\nsecret bottles of these deadly syrups, for the purpose of stilling their\r\ncharges, is notorious; and that many use them to a fearful extent, is\r\nsufficiently patent to all.\r\n\r\n2444. It therefore behoves the mother, while obliged to trust to a\r\nnurse, to use her best discretion to guard her child from the\r\nunprincipled treatment of the person she must, to a certain extent,\r\ndepend upon and trust; and to remember, in all cases, rather than resort\r\nto castor-oil or sedatives, to consult a medical man for her infant in\r\npreference to following the counsel of her nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REARING, MANAGEMENT, AND DISEASES OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysiology of Life, as illustrated by Respiration, Circulation, and\r\nDigestion.\r\n\r\n2445. The infantine management of children, like the mother's love for\r\nher offspring, seems to be born with the child, and to be a direct\r\nintelligence of Nature. It may thus, at first sight, appear as\r\ninconsistent and presumptuous to tell a woman how to rear her infant as\r\nto instruct her in the manner of loving it. Yet, though Nature is\r\nunquestionably the best nurse, Art makes so admirable a foster-mother,\r\nthat no sensible woman, in her novitiate of parent, would refuse the\r\nadmonitions of art, or the teachings of experience, to consummate her\r\nduties of nurse. It is true that, in a civilized state of society, few\r\nyoung wives reach the epoch that makes them mothers without some\r\ninsight, traditional or practical, into the management of infants:\r\nconsequently, the cases wherein a woman is left to her own unaided\r\nintelligence, or what, in such a case, may be called instinct, and\r\nobliged to trust to the promptings of nature alone for the well-being of\r\nher child, are very rare indeed. Again, every woman is not gifted with\r\nthe same physical ability for the harassing duties of a mother; and\r\nthough Nature, as a general rule, has endowed all female creation with\r\nthe attributes necessary to that most beautiful and, at the same time,\r\nholiest function,--the healthy rearing of their offspring,--the cases\r\nare sufficiently numerous to establish the exception, where the mother\r\nis either physically or socially incapacitated from undertaking these\r\nmost pleasing duties herself, and where, consequently, she is compelled\r\nto trust to adventitious aid for those natural benefits which are at\r\nonce the mother's pride and delight to render to her child.\r\n\r\n2446. In these cases, when obliged to call in the services of hired\r\nassistance, she must trust the dearest obligation of her life to one\r\nwho, from her social sphere, has probably notions of rearing children\r\ndiametrically opposed to the preconceived ideas of the mother, and at\r\nenmity with all her sentiments of right and prejudices of position.\r\n\r\n2447. It has justly been said--we think by Hood--that the children of\r\nthe poor are not brought up, but _dragged up_. However facetious this\r\nremark may seem, there is much truth in it; and that children, reared in\r\nthe reeking dens of squalor and poverty, live at all, is an apparent\r\nanomaly in the course of things, that, at first sight, would seem to set\r\nthe laws of sanitary provision at defiance, and make it appear a perfect\r\nwaste of time to insist on pure air and exercise as indispensable\r\nnecessaries of life, and especially so as regards infantine existence.\r\n\r\n2448. We see elaborate care bestowed on a family of children, everything\r\nstudied that can tend to their personal comfort,--pure air, pure water,\r\nregular ablution, a dietary prescribed by art, and every precaution\r\nadopted that medical judgment and maternal love can dictate, for the\r\nwell-being of the parents' hope; and find, in despite of all this care\r\nand vigilance, disease and death invading the guarded treasure. We turn\r\nto the foetor and darkness that, in some obscure court, attend the\r\nrobust brood who, coated in dirt, and with mud and refuse for\r\nplaythings, live and thrive, and grow into manhood, and, in contrast to\r\nthe pale face and flabby flesh of the aristocratic child, exhibit\r\nstrength, vigour, and well-developed frames, and our belief in the\r\npotency of the life-giving elements of air, light, and cleanliness\r\nreceives a shock that, at first sight, would appear fatal to the implied\r\nbenefits of these, in reality, all-sufficient attributes of health and\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n2449. But as we must enter more largely on this subject hereafter, we\r\nshall leave its consideration for the present, and return to what we\r\nwere about to say respecting trusting to others' aid in the rearing of\r\nchildren. Here it is that the young and probably inexperienced mother\r\nmay find our remarks not only an assistance but a comfort to her, in as\r\nfar as, knowing the simplest and best system to adopt, she may be able\r\nto instruct another, and see that her directions are fully carried out.\r\n\r\n2450. The human body, materially considered, is a beautiful piece of\r\nmechanism, consisting of many parts, each one being the centre of a\r\nsystem, and performing its own vital function irrespectively of the\r\nothers, and yet dependent for its vitality upon the harmony and health\r\nof the whole. It is, in fact, to a certain extent, like a watch, which,\r\nwhen once wound up and set in motion, will continue its function of\r\nrecording true time only so long as every wheel, spring, and lever\r\nperforms its allotted duty, and at its allotted time; or till the limit\r\nthat man's ingenuity has placed to its existence as a moving automaton\r\nhas been reached, or, in other words, till it has run down.\r\n\r\n2451. What the key is to the mechanical watch, air is to the physical\r\nman. Once admit air into the mouth and nostrils, and the lungs expand,\r\nthe heart beats, the blood rushes to the remotest part of the body, the\r\nmouth secretes saliva, to soften and macerate the food; the liver forms\r\nits bile, to separate the nutriment from the digested aliment; the\r\nkidneys perform their office; the eye elaborates its tears, to\r\nfacilitate motion and impart that glistening to the orb on which depends\r\nso much of its beauty; and a dewy moisture exudes from the skin,\r\nprotecting the body from the extremes of heat and cold, and sharpening\r\nthe perception of touch and feeling. At the same instant, and in every\r\npart, the arteries, like innumerable bees, are everywhere laying down\r\nlayers of muscle, bones, teeth, and, in fact, like the coral zoophyte,\r\nbuilding up a continent of life and matter; while the veins, equally\r\nbusy, are carrying away the _débris_ and refuse collected from where the\r\nzoophyte arteries are building,--this refuse, in its turn, being\r\nconveyed to the liver, there to be converted into bile.\r\n\r\n2452. All these--and they are but a few of the vital actions constantly\r\ntaking place--are the instant result of one gasp of life-giving air. No\r\nsubject can be fraught with greater interest than watching the first\r\nspark of life, as it courses with electric speed \"through all the gates\r\nand alleys\" of the soft, insensate body of the infant. The effect of air\r\non the new-born child is as remarkable in its results as it is wonderful\r\nin its consequence; but to understand this more intelligibly, it must\r\nfirst be remembered that life consists of the performance of _three_\r\nvital functions--RESPIRATION, CIRCULATION, and DIGESTION. The lungs\r\ndigest the air, taking from it its most nutritious element, the\r\n_oxygen_, to give to the impoverished blood that circulates\r\nthrough them. The stomach digests the food, and separates the\r\nnutriment--_chyle_--from the aliment, which it gives to the blood for\r\nthe development of the frame; and the blood, which is understood by the\r\nterm circulation, digests in its passage through the lungs the\r\nnutriment--_chyle_--to give it quantity and quality, and the _oxygen_\r\nfrom the air to give it vitality. Hence it will be seen, that, speaking\r\ngenerally, the three vital functions resolve themselves into\r\none,--DIGESTION; and that the lungs are the primary and the most\r\nimportant of the vital organs; and respiration, the first in fact, as we\r\nall know it is the last in deed, of all the functions performed by the\r\nliving body.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LUNGS.--RESPIRATION.\r\n\r\n2453. The first effect of air on the infant is a slight tremor about the\r\nlips and angles of the mouth, increasing to twitchings, and finally to a\r\nconvulsive contraction of the lips and cheeks, the consequence of sudden\r\ncold to the nerves of the face. This spasmodic action produces a gasp,\r\ncausing the air to rush through the mouth and nostrils, and enter the\r\nwindpipe and upper portion of the flat and contracted lungs, which, like\r\na sponge partly immersed in water, immediately expand. This is succeeded\r\nby a few faint sobs or pants, by which larger volumes of air are drawn\r\ninto the chest, till, after a few seconds, and when a greater bulk of\r\nthe lungs has become inflated, the breast-bone and ribs rise, the chest\r\nexpands, and, with a sudden start, the infant gives utterance to a\r\nsuccession of loud, sharp cries, which have the effect of filling every\r\ncell of the entire organ with air and life. To the anxious mother, the\r\nfirst voice of her child is, doubtless, the sweetest music she ever\r\nheard; and the more loudly it peals, the greater should be her joy, as\r\nit is an indication of health and strength, and not only shows the\r\nperfect expansion of the lungs, but that the process of life has set in\r\nwith vigour. Having welcomed in its own existence, like the morning\r\nbird, with a shrill note of gladness, the infant ceases its cry, and,\r\nafter a few short sobs, usually subsides into sleep or quietude.\r\n\r\n2454. At the same instant that the air rushes into the lungs, the valve,\r\nor door between the two sides of the heart-and through which the blood\r\nhad previously passed-is closed and hermetically sealed, and the blood\r\ntaking a new course, bounds into the lungs, now expanded with air, and\r\nwhich we have likened to a wetted sponge, to which they bear a not unapt\r\naffinity, air being substituted for water. It here receives the _oxygen_\r\nfrom the atmosphere, and the _chyle_, or white blood, from the digested\r\nfood, and becomes, in an instant, arterial blood, a vital principle,\r\nfrom which every solid and fluid of the body is constructed. Besides the\r\nlungs, Nature has provided another respiratory organ, a sort of\r\nsupplemental lung, that, as well as being a covering to the body,\r\n_in_spires air and _ex_pires moisture;--this is the cuticle, or skin;\r\nand so intimate is the connection between the skin and lungs, that\r\nwhatever injures the first, is certain to affect the latter.\r\n\r\n2455. _Hence the difficulty of breathing experienced after scalds or\r\nburns on the cuticle, the cough that follows the absorption of cold or\r\ndamp by the skin, the oppressed and laborious breathing experienced by\r\nchildren in all eruptive diseases, while the rash is coming to the\r\nsurface, and the hot, dry skin that always attends congestion of the\r\nlungs, and fever._\r\n\r\n2456. The great practical advantage derivable from this fact is, the\r\nknowledge that whatever relieves the one benefits the other. Hence,\r\ntoo, the great utility of hot baths in all affections of the lungs or\r\ndiseases of the skin; and the reason why exposure to cold or wet is, in\r\nnearly all cases, followed by tightness of the chest, sore throat,\r\ndifficulty of breathing, and cough. These symptoms are the consequence\r\nof a larger quantity of blood than is natural remaining in the lungs,\r\nand the cough is a mere effort of Nature to throw off the obstruction\r\ncaused by the presence of too much blood in the organ of respiration.\r\nThe hot bath, by causing a larger amount of blood to rush suddenly to\r\nthe skin, has the effect of relieving the lungs of their excess of\r\nblood, and by equalizing the circulation, and promoting perspiration\r\nfrom the cuticle, affords immediate and direct benefit, both to the\r\nlungs and the system at large.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STOMACH--DIGESTION.\r\n\r\n2457. The organs that either directly or indirectly contribute to the\r\nprocess of digestion are, the mouth, teeth, tongue, and gullet, the\r\nstomach, small intestines, the pancreas, the salivary glands, and the\r\nliver. Next to respiration, digestion is the chief function in the\r\neconomy of life, as, without the nutritious fluid digested from the\r\naliment, there would be nothing to supply the immense and constantly\r\nrecurring waste of the system, caused by the activity with which the\r\narteries at all periods, but especially during infancy and youth, are\r\nbuilding up the frame and developing the body. In infancy (the period of\r\nwhich our present subject treats), the series of parts engaged in the\r\nprocess of digestion may be reduced simply to the stomach and liver, or\r\nrather its secretion,--the bile. The stomach is a thick muscular bag,\r\nconnected above with the gullet, and, at its lower extremity, with the\r\ncommencement of the small intestines. The duty or function of the\r\nstomach is to secrete from the arteries spread over its inner surface, a\r\nsharp acid liquid called the _gastric_ juice; this, with a due mixture\r\nof saliva, softens, dissolves, and gradually digests the food or\r\ncontents of the stomach, reducing the whole into a soft pulpy mass,\r\nwhich then passes into the first part of the small intestines, where it\r\ncomes in contact with the bile from the gall-bladder, which immediately\r\nseparates the digested food into two parts, one is a white creamy fluid\r\ncalled chyle, and the absolute concentration of all nourishment, which\r\nis taken up by proper vessels, and, as we have before said, carried\r\ndirectly to the heart, to be made blood of, and vitalized in the lungs,\r\nand thus provide for the wear and tear of the system. It must be here\r\nobserved that the stomach can only digest solids, for fluids, being\r\nincapable of that process, can only be _absorbed_; and without the\r\nresult of digestion, animal, at least human life, could not exist. Now,\r\nas Nature has ordained that infantine life shall be supported on liquid\r\naliment, and as, without a digestion the body would perish, some\r\nprovision was necessary to meet this difficulty, and that provision was\r\nfound in the nature of the liquid itself, or in other words, THE MILK.\r\nThe process of making cheese, or fresh curds and whey, is familiar to\r\nmost persons; but as it is necessary to the elucidation of our subject,\r\nwe will briefly repeat it. The internal membrane, or the lining coat of\r\na calf's stomach, having been removed from the organ, is hung up, like a\r\nbladder, to dry; when required, a piece is cut off, put in a jug, a\r\nlittle warm water poured upon it, and after a few hours it is fit for\r\nuse; the liquid so made being called _rennet_. A little of this rennet,\r\npoured into a basin of warm milk, at once coagulates the greater part,\r\nand separates from it a quantity of thin liquor, called _whey_. This is\r\nprecisely the action that takes place in the infant's stomach after\r\nevery supply from the breast. The cause is the same in both cases, the\r\nacid of the gastric juice in the infant's stomach immediately converting\r\nthe milk into a soft cheese. It is gastric juice, adhering to the calf's\r\nstomach, and drawn out by the water, forming rennet, that makes the\r\ncurds in the basin. The cheesy substance being a solid, at once\r\nundergoes the process of digestion, is separated into _chyle_ by the\r\nbile, and, in a few hours, finds its way to the infant's heart, to\r\nbecome blood, and commence the architecture of its little frame. This is\r\nthe simple process of a baby's digestion:-milk converted into cheese,\r\ncheese into _chyle_, chyle into blood, and blood into flesh, bone, and\r\ntegument-how simple is the cause, but how sublime and wonderful are the\r\neffects!\r\n\r\n2458. We have described the most important of the three functions that\r\ntake place in the infant's body-respiration and digestion; the third,\r\nnamely, circulation, we hardly think it necessary to enter on, not being\r\ncalled for by the requirements of the nurse and mother; so we shall omit\r\nits notice, and proceed from theoretical to more practical\r\nconsiderations. Children of weakly constitutions are just as likely to\r\nbe born of robust parents, and those who earn their bread by toil, as\r\nthe offspring of luxury and affluence; and, indeed, it is against the\r\nordinary providence of Nature to suppose the children of the hardworking\r\nand necessitous to be hardier and more vigorous than those of parents\r\nblessed with ease and competence.\r\n\r\n2459. All children come into the world in the same imploring\r\nhelplessness, with the same general organization and wants, and\r\ndemanding either from the newly-awakened mother's love, or from the\r\nmemory of motherly feeling in the nurse, or the common appeals of\r\nhumanity in those who undertake the earliest duties of an infant, the\r\nsame assistance and protection, and the same fostering care.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INFANT.\r\n\r\n2460. We have already described the phenomena produced on the new-born\r\nchild by the contact of air, which, after a succession of muscular\r\ntwitchings, becomes endowed with voice, and heralds its advent by a loud\r\nbut brief succession of cries. But though this is the general rule, it\r\nsometimes happens (from causes it is unnecessary here to explain) that\r\nthe infant does not cry, or give utterance to any audible sounds, or if\r\nit does, they are so faint as scarcely to be distinguished as human\r\naccents, plainly indicating that life, as yet, to the new visitor, is\r\nneither a boon nor a blessing; the infant being, in fact, in a state of\r\nsuspended or imperfect vitality,--a state of _quasi_ existence, closely\r\napproximating the condition of a _still-birth_.\r\n\r\n2461. As soon as this state of things is discovered, the child should be\r\nturned on its right side, and the whole length of the spine, from the\r\nhead downwards, rubbed with all the fingers of the right hand, sharply\r\nand quickly, without intermission, till the quick action has not only\r\nevoked heat, but electricity in the part, and till the loud and sharp\r\ncries of the child have thoroughly expanded the lungs, and\r\nsatisfactorily established its life. The operation will seldom require\r\nabove a minute to effect, and less frequently demands a repetition. If\r\nthere is brandy at hand, the fingers before rubbing may be dipped into\r\nthat, or any other spirit.\r\n\r\n2462. There-is another condition of what we may call \"mute births,\"\r\nwhere the child only makes short ineffectual gasps, and those at\r\nintervals of a minute or two apart, when the lips, eyelids, and fingers\r\nbecome of a deep purple or slate colour, sometimes half the body\r\nremaining white, while the other half, which was at first swarthy,\r\ndeepens to a livid hue. This condition of the infant is owing to the\r\nvalve between the two sides of the heart remaining open, and allowing\r\nthe unvitalized venous blood to enter the arteries and get into the\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\n2463. The object in this case, as in the previous one, is to dilate the\r\nlungs as quickly as possible, so that, by the sudden effect of a\r\nvigorous inspiration, the valve may be firmly closed, and the impure\r\nblood, losing this means of egress, be sent directly to the lungs. The\r\nsame treatment is therefore necessary as in the previous case, with the\r\naddition, if the friction along the spine has failed, of a warm bath at\r\na temperature of about 80°, in which the child is to be plunged up to\r\nthe neck, first cleansing the mouth and nostrils of the mucus that might\r\ninterfere with the free passage of air.\r\n\r\n2464. While in the bath, the friction along the spine is to be\r\ncontinued, and if the lungs still remain unexpended, while one person\r\nretains the child in an inclined position in the water, another should\r\ninsert the pipe of a small pair of bellows into one nostril, and while\r\nthe month is closed and the other nostril compressed on the pipe with\r\nthe hand of the assistant, the lungs are to be slowly inflated by steady\r\npuffs of air from the bellows, the hand being removed from the mouth and\r\nnose after each inflation, and placed on the pit of the stomach, and by\r\na steady pressure expelling it out again by the mouth. This process is\r\nto be continued, steadily inflating and expelling the air from the\r\nlungs, till, with a sort of tremulous leap, Nature takes up the process,\r\nand the infant begins to gasp, and finally to cry, at first low and\r\nfaint, but with every gulp of air increasing in length and strength of\r\nvolume, when it is to be removed from the water, and instantly wrapped\r\n(all but the face and mouth) in a flannel. Sometimes, however, all these\r\nmeans will fail in effecting an utterance from the child, which will\r\nlie, with livid lips and a flaccid body, every few minutes opening its\r\nmouth with a short gasping pant, and then subsiding into a state of\r\npulseless inaction, lingering probably some hours, till the spasmodic\r\npantings growing further apart, it ceases to exist.\r\n\r\n2465. The time that this state of negative vitality will linger in the\r\nframe of an infant is remarkable; and even when all the previous\r\noperations, though long-continued, have proved ineffectual, the child\r\nwill often rally from the simplest of means--the application of dry\r\nheat. When removed from the bath, place three or four hot bricks or\r\ntiles on the hearth, and lay the child, loosely folded in a flannel, on\r\nits back along them, taking care that there is but one fold of flannel\r\nbetween the spine and heated bricks or tiles. When neither of these\r\narticles can be procured, put a few clear pieces of red cinder in a\r\nwarming-pan, and extend the child in the same manner along the closed\r\nlid. As the heat gradually diffuses itself over the spinal marrow, the\r\nchild that was dying, or seemingly dead, will frequently give a sudden\r\nand energetic cry, succeeded in another minute by a long and vigorous\r\npeal, making up, in volume and force, for the previous delay, and\r\ninstantly confirming its existence by every effort in its nature.\r\n\r\n2466. With these two exceptions,--restored by the means we have pointed\r\nout to the functions of life,--we will proceed to the consideration of\r\nthe child HEALTHILY BORN. Here the first thing that meets us on the\r\nthreshold of inquiry, and what is often between mother and nurse not\r\nonly a vexed question, but one of vexatious import, is the _crying_ of\r\nthe child; the mother, in her natural anxiety, maintaining that her\r\ninfant _must be ill_ to cause it to cry so much or so often, and the\r\nnurse insisting that _all_ children cry, and that nothing is the matter\r\nwith it, and that crying does good, and is, indeed, an especial benefit\r\nto infancy. The anxious and unfamiliar mother, though not convinced by\r\nthese abstract sayings of the truth or wisdom of the explanation, takes\r\nboth for granted; and, giving the nurse credit for more knowledge and\r\nexperience on this head than she can have, contentedly resigns herself\r\nto the infliction, as a thing necessary to be endured for the good of\r\nthe baby, but thinking it, at the same time, an extraordinary instance\r\nof the imperfectibility of Nature as regards the human infant; for her\r\nmind wanders to what she has observed in her childhood with puppies and\r\nkittens, who, except when rudely torn from their nurse, seldom give\r\nutterance to any complaining.\r\n\r\n2467. We, undoubtedly, believe that crying, to a certain extent, is not\r\nonly conducive to health, but positively necessary to the full\r\ndevelopment and physical economy of the infant's being. But though\r\nholding this opinion, we are far from believing that a child does not\r\nvery often cry from pain, thirst, want of food, and attention to its\r\npersonal comfort; but there is as much difference in the tone and\r\nexpression of a child's cry as in the notes of an adult's voice; and the\r\nmother's ear will not be long in discriminating between the sharp\r\npeevish whine of irritation and fever, and the louder intermitting cry\r\nthat characterizes the want of warmth and sleep. All these shades of\r\nexpression in the child's inarticulate voice every nurse _should_\r\nunderstand, and every mother will soon teach herself to interpret them\r\nwith an accuracy equal to language.\r\n\r\n2468. There is no part of a woman's duty to her child that a young\r\nmother should so soon make it her business to study, as the voice of her\r\ninfant, and the language conveyed in its cry. The study is neither hard\r\nnor difficult; a close attention to its tone, and the expression of the\r\nbaby's features, are the two most important points demanding attention.\r\nThe key to both the mother will find in her own heart, and the knowledge\r\nof her success in the comfort and smile of her infant. We have two\r\nreasons--both strong ones--for urging on mothers the imperative\r\nnecessity of early making themselves acquainted with the nature and\r\nwants of their child: the first, that when left to the entire,\r\nresponsibility of the baby, after the departure of the nurse, she may be\r\nable to undertake her new duties with more confidence than if left to\r\nher own resources and mother's instinct, without a clue to guide her\r\nthrough the mysteries of those calls that vibrate through every nerve of\r\nher nature; and, secondly, that she may be able to guard her child from\r\nthe nefarious practices of unprincipled nurses, who, while calming the\r\nmother's mind with false statements as to the character of the baby's\r\ncries, rather than lose their rest, or devote that time which would\r\nremove the cause of suffering, administer, behind the curtains, those\r\ndeadly narcotics which, while stupefying Nature into sleep, insure for\r\nherself a night of many unbroken hours. Such nurses as have not the\r\nhardihood to dose their infant charges, are often full of other schemes\r\nto still that constant and reproachful cry. The most frequent means\r\nemployed for this purpose is giving it something to suck,--something\r\neasily hid from the mother,--or, when that is impossible, under the plea\r\nof keeping it warm, the nurse covers it in her lap with a shawl, and,\r\nunder this blind, surreptitiously inserts a finger between the parched\r\nlips, which possibly moan for drink; and, under this inhuman cheat and\r\ndelusion, the infant is pacified, till Nature, balked of its desires,\r\ndrops into a troubled sleep. These are two of our reasons for impressing\r\nupon mothers the early, the immediate necessity of putting themselves\r\nsympathetically in communication with their child, by at once learning\r\nits hidden language as a delightful task.\r\n\r\n2469. We must strenuously warn all mothers on no account to allow the\r\nnurse to sleep with the baby, never herself to lay down with it by her\r\nside for a night's rest, never to let it sleep in the parents' bed, and\r\non no account keep it, longer than absolutely necessary, confined in on\r\natmosphere loaded with the breath of many adults.\r\n\r\n2470. The amount of _oxygen_ required by an infant is so large, and the\r\nquantity consumed by mid-life and age, and the proportion of carbonic\r\nacid thrown off from both, so considerable, that an infant breathing the\r\nsame air cannot possibly carry on its healthy existence while deriving\r\nits vitality from so corrupted a medium. This objection, always in\r\nforce, is still more objectionable at night-time, when doors and windows\r\nare closed, and amounts to a condition of poison, when placed between\r\ntwo adults in sleep, and shut in by bed-curtains; and when, in addition\r\nto the impurities expired from the lungs, we remember, in quiescence and\r\nsleep, how large a portion of mephitic gas is given off from the skin.\r\n\r\n2471. Mothers, in the fullness of their affection, believe there is no\r\nharbour, sleeping or awake, where their infants can be so secure from\r\nall possible or probable danger as in their own arms; yet we should\r\nastound our readers if we told them the statistical number of infants\r\nwho, in despite of their motherly solicitude and love, are annually\r\nkilled, unwittingly, by such parents themselves, and this from the\r\npersistency in the practice we are so strenuously condemning. The mother\r\nfrequently, on awaking, discovers the baby's face closely impacted\r\nbetween her bosom and her arm, and its body rigid and lifeless; or else\r\nso enveloped in the \"head-blanket\" and superincumbent bedclothes, as to\r\nrender breathing a matter of physical impossibility. In such cases the\r\njury in general returns a verdict of \"_Accidentally overlaid_\" but one\r\nof \"Careless suffocation\" would be more in accordance with truth and\r\njustice. The only possible excuse that can be urged, either by nurse or\r\nmother, for this culpable practice, is the plea of imparting warmth to\r\nthe infant. But this can always be effected by an extra blanket in the\r\nchild's crib, or, if the weather is particularly cold, by a bottle of\r\nhot water enveloped in flannel and placed at the child's feet; while all\r\nthe objections already urged--as derivable from animal heat imparted by\r\nactual contact--are entirely obviated. There is another evil attending\r\nthe sleeping together of the mother and infant, which, as far as regards\r\nthe latter, we consider quite as formidable, though not so immediate as\r\nthe others, and is always followed by more or less of mischief to the\r\nmother. The evil we now allude to is that most injurious practice of\r\nletting the child _suck_ after the mother has _fallen asleep_, a custom\r\nthat naturally results from the former, and which, as we hare already\r\nsaid, is injurious to both mother and child. It is injurious to the\r\ninfant by allowing it, without control, to imbibe to distension a fluid\r\nsluggishly secreted and deficient in those vital principles which the\r\nwant of mental energy, and of the sympathetic appeals of the child on\r\nthe mother, so powerfully produce on the secreted nutriment, while the\r\nmother wakes in a state of clammy exhaustion, with giddiness, dimness of\r\nsight, nausea, loss of appetite, and a dull aching pain through the back\r\nand between the shoulders. In fact, she wakes languid and unrefreshed\r\nfrom her sleep, with febrile symptoms and hectic flushes, caused by her\r\nbaby vampire, who, while dragging from her her health and strength, has\r\nexcited in itself a set of symptoms directly opposite, but fraught with\r\nthe same injurious consequences--\"functional derangement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILK.\r\n\r\n2472. As Nature has placed in the bosom of the mother the natural food\r\nof her offspring, it must be self-evident to every reflecting woman,\r\nthat it becomes her duty to study, as far as lies in her power, to keep\r\nthat reservoir of nourishment in as pure and invigorating a condition as\r\npossible; for she must remember that the _quantity_ is no proof of the\r\n_quality_ of this aliment.\r\n\r\n2473. The mother, while suckling, as a general rule, should avoid all\r\nsedentary occupations, take regular exercise, keep her mind as lively\r\nand pleasingly occupied as possible, especially by music and singing.\r\nHer diet should be light and nutritious, with a proper sufficiency of\r\nanimal food, and of that kind which yields the largest amount of\r\nnourishment; and, unless the digestion is naturally strong, vegetables\r\nand fruit should form a very small proportion of the general dietary,\r\nand such preparations as broths, gruels, arrowroot, &c., still less.\r\nTapioca, or ground-rice pudding, made with several eggs, may be taken\r\nfreely; but all slops and thin potations, such as that delusion called\r\nchicken-broth, should be avoided, as yielding a very small amount of\r\nnutriment, and a large proportion of flatulence. All purely stimulants\r\nshould be avoided as much as possible, especially spirits, unless taken\r\nfor some special object, and that medicinally; but as a part of the\r\ndietary they should be carefully shunned. Lactation is always an\r\nexhausting process, and as the child increases in size and strength, the\r\ndrain upon the mother becomes great and depressing. Then something more\r\neven than an abundant diet is required to keep the mind and body up to a\r\nstandard sufficiently healthy to admit of a constant and nutritious\r\nsecretion being performed without detriment to the physical integrity of\r\nthe mother, or injury to the child who imbibes it; and as stimulants are\r\ninadmissible, if not positively injurious, the substitute required is to\r\nbe found in _malt liquor_. To the lady accustomed to her Madeira and\r\nsherry, this may appear a very vulgar potation for a delicate young\r\nmother to take instead of the more subtle and condensed elegance of\r\nwine; but as we are writing from experience, and with the avowed object\r\nof imparting useful facts and beneficial remedies to our readers, we\r\nallow no social distinctions to interfere with our legitimate object.\r\n\r\n2474. We have already said that the suckling mother should avoid\r\nstimulants, especially spirituous ones; and though something of this\r\nsort is absolutely necessary to support her strength during the\r\nexhausting process, it should be rather of a _tonic_ than of a\r\nstimulating character; and as all wines contain a large percentage of\r\nbrandy, they are on that account less beneficial than the pure juice of\r\nthe fermented grape might be. But there is another consideration to be\r\ntaken into account on this subject; the mother has not only to think of\r\nherself, but also of her infant. Now wines, especially port wine, very\r\noften--indeed, most frequently--affect the baby's bowels, and what might\r\nhave been grateful to the mother becomes thus a source of pain and\r\nirritation to the child afterwards. Sherry is less open to this\r\nobjection than other wines, yet still _it_ very frequently does\r\ninfluence the second participator, or the child whose mother has taken\r\nit.\r\n\r\n2475. The nine or twelve months a woman usually suckles must be, to some\r\nextent, to most mothers, a period of privation and penance, and unless\r\nshe is deaf to the cries of her baby, and insensible to its kicks and\r\nplunges, and will not see in such muscular evidences the griping pains\r\nthat rack her child, she will avoid every article that can remotely\r\naffect the little being who draws its sustenance from her. She will see\r\nthat the babe is acutely affected by all that in any way influences her,\r\nand willingly curtail her own enjoyments, rather than see her infant\r\nrendered feverish, irritable, and uncomfortable. As the best tonic,\r\nthen, and the most efficacious indirect stimulant that a mother can take\r\nat such times, there is no potation equal to _porter_ and _stout_, or,\r\nwhat is better still, an equal part of porter and stout. Ale, except for\r\na few constitutions, is too subtle and too sweet, generally causing\r\nacidity or heartburn, and stout alone is too potent to admit of a full\r\ndraught, from its proneness to affect the head; and quantity, as well as\r\nmoderate strength, is required to make the draught effectual; the equal\r\nmixture, therefore, of stout and porter yields all the properties\r\ndesired or desirable as a medicinal agent for this purpose.\r\n\r\n2476. Independently of its invigorating influence on the constitution,\r\n_porter exerts a marked and specific effect on the secretion of milk;\r\nmore powerful in exciting an abundant supply of that fluid than any\r\nother article within the range of the physician's art;_ and, in cases of\r\ndeficient quantity, is the most certain, speedy, and the healthiest\r\nmeans that can be employed to insure a quick and abundant flow. In cases\r\nwhere malt liquor produces flatulency, a few grains of the \"carbonate of\r\nsoda\" may advantageously be added to each glass immediately before\r\ndrinking, which will have the effect of neutralizing any acidity that\r\nmay be in the porter at the time, and will also prevent its\r\nafter-disagreement with the stomach. The quantity to be taken must\r\ndepend upon the natural strength of the mother, the age and demand made\r\nby the infant on the parent, and other causes; but the amount should\r\nvary from _one_ to _two_ pints a day, never taking less than half a pint\r\nat a time, which should be repeated three or four times a day.\r\n\r\n2477. We have said that the period of suckling is a season of penance to\r\nthe mother, but this is not invariably the case; and, as so much must\r\ndepend upon the natural strength of the stomach, and its power of\r\nassimilating all kinds of food into healthy _chyle_, it is impossible to\r\ndefine exceptions. Where a woman feels she can eat any kind of food,\r\nwithout inconvenience or detriment, she should live during her suckling\r\nas she did before; but, as a general rule, we are bound to advise all\r\nmothers to abstain from such articles as pickles, fruits, cucumbers, and\r\nall acid and slowly digestible foods, unless they wish for restless\r\nnights and crying infants.\r\n\r\n2478. As regards exercise and amusement, we would certainly neither\r\nprohibit a mother's dancing, going to a theatre, nor even from attending\r\nan assembly. The first, however, is the best indoor recreation she can\r\ntake, and a young mother will do well to often amuse herself in the\r\nnursery with this most excellent means of healthful circulation. The\r\nonly precaution necessary is to avoid letting the child suck the milk\r\nthat has lain long in the breast, or is heated by excessive action.\r\n\r\n2479. Every mother who can, should be provided with a breast-pump, or\r\nglass tube, to draw off the superabundance that has been accumulating in\r\nher absence from the child, or the first gush excited by undue exertion:\r\nthe subsequent supply of milk will be secreted under the invigorating\r\ninfluence of a previous healthy stimulus.\r\n\r\n2480. As the first milk that is secreted contains a large amount of the\r\nsaline elements, and is thin and innutritious, it is most admirably\r\nadapted for the purpose Nature designed it to fulfil,--that of an\r\naperient; but which, unfortunately, it is seldom permitted, in our\r\nartificial mode of living, to perform.\r\n\r\n2481. So opposed are we to the objectionable plan of physicking new-born\r\nchildren, that, unless for positive illness, we would much rather advise\r\nthat medicine should be administered _through_ the mother for the first\r\neight or ten weeks of its existence. This practice, which few mothers\r\nwill object to, is easily effected by the parent, when such a course is\r\nnecessary for the child, taking either a dose of castor-oil, half an\r\nounce of tasteless salts (the phosphate of soda), one or two\r\nteaspoonfuls of magnesia, a dose of lenitive electuary, manna, or any\r\nmild and simple aperient, which, almost before it can have taken effect\r\non herself, will exhibit its action on her child.\r\n\r\n2482. One of the most common errors that mothers fall into while\r\nsuckling their children, is that of fancying they are always hungry, and\r\nconsequently overfeeding them; and with this, the great mistake of\r\napplying the child to the breast on every occasion of its crying,\r\nwithout investigating the cause of its complaint, and, under the belief\r\nthat it wants food, putting the nipple into its crying mouth, until the\r\ninfant turns in revulsion and petulance from what it should accept with\r\neagerness and joy. At such times, a few teaspoonfuls of water, slightly\r\nchilled, will often instantly pacify a crying and restless child, who\r\nhas turned in loathing from the offered breast; or, after imbibing a few\r\ndrops, and finding it not what nature craved, throws back its head in\r\ndisgust, and cries more petulantly than before. In such a case as this,\r\nthe young mother, grieved at her baby's rejection of the tempting\r\npresent, and distressed at its cries, and in terror of some injury, over\r\nand over ransacks its clothes, believing some insecure pin can alone be\r\nthe cause of such sharp complaining, an accident that, from her own care\r\nin dressing, however, is seldom or ever the case.\r\n\r\n2483. These abrupt cries of the child, if they do not proceed from\r\nthirst, which a little water will relieve, not unfrequently occur from\r\nsome unequal pressure, a fold or twist in the \"roller,\" or some\r\nconstriction round the tender body. If this is suspected, the mother\r\nmust not be content with merely slackening the strings; the child should\r\nbe undressed, and the creases and folds of the hot skin, especially\r\nthose about the thighs and groins, examined, to see that no powder has\r\ncaked, and, becoming hard, irritated the parts. The violet powder should\r\nbe dusted freely over all, to cool the skin, and everything put on fresh\r\nand smooth. If such precautions have not afforded relief, and, in\r\naddition to the crying, the child plunges or draws up its legs, the\r\nmother may be assured some cause of irritation exists in the stomach or\r\nbowels,--either acidity in the latter or distension from overfeeding in\r\nthe former; but, from whichever cause, the child should be \"opened\"\r\nbefore the fire, and a heated napkin applied all over the abdomen, the\r\ninfant being occasionally elevated to a sitting position, and while\r\ngently jolted on the knee, the back should be lightly patted with the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n2484. Should the mother have any reason to apprehend that the _cause_ of\r\ninconvenience proceeds from the bladder--a not unfrequent source of\r\npain,--the napkin is to be dipped in hot water, squeezed out, and\r\nimmediately applied over the part, and repeated every eight or ten\r\nminutes, for several times in succession, either till the natural relief\r\nis afforded, or a cessation of pain allows of its discontinuance. The\r\npain that young infants often suffer, and the crying that results from\r\nit, is, as we have already said, frequently caused by the mother\r\ninconsiderately overfeeding her child, and is produced by the pain of\r\ndistension, and the mechanical pressure of a larger quantity of fluid in\r\nthe stomach than the gastric juice can convert into cheese and digest.\r\n\r\n2485. Some children are stronger in the enduring power of the stomach\r\nthan others, and get rid of the excess by vomiting, concluding every\r\nprocess of suckling by an emission of milk and curd. Such children are\r\ncalled by nurses \"thriving children;\" and generally they are so, simply\r\nbecause their digestion is good, and they have the power of expelling\r\nwith impunity that superabundance of aliment which in others is a source\r\nof distension, flatulence, and pain.\r\n\r\n2486. The length of time an infant should be suckled must depend much on\r\nthe health and strength of the child, and the health of the mother, and\r\nthe quantity and quality of her milk; though, when all circumstances are\r\nfavourable, it should never be less than _nine_, nor exceed _fifteen_\r\nmonths; but perhaps the true time will be found in the medium between\r\nboth. But of this we may be sure, that Nature never ordained a child to\r\nlive on suction after having endowed it with teeth to bite and to grind;\r\nand nothing is more out of place and unseemly than to hear a child, with\r\na set of twenty teeth, ask for \"the breast.\"\r\n\r\n2487. The practice of protracted wet-nursing is hurtful to the mother,\r\nby keeping up an uncalled-for, and, after the proper time, an unhealthy\r\ndrain on her system, while the child either derives no benefit from what\r\nit no longer requires, or it produces a positive injury on its\r\nconstitution. After the period when Nature has ordained the child shall\r\nlive by other means, the secretion of milk becomes thin and\r\ndeteriorated, showing in the flabby flesh and puny features of the child\r\nboth its loss of nutritious properties and the want of more stimulating\r\naliment.\r\n\r\n2488. Though we have said that twelve months is about the medium time a\r\nbaby should be suckled, we by no means wish to imply that a child should\r\nbe fed exclusively on milk for its first year; quite the reverse; the\r\ninfant can hardly be too soon made independent of the mother. Thus,\r\nshould illness assail her, her milk fail, or any domestic cause abruptly\r\ncut off the natural supply, the child having been annealed to an\r\nartificial diet, its life might be safely carried on without seeking for\r\na wet-nurse, and without the slightest danger to its system.\r\n\r\n2489. The advantage to the mother of early accustoming the child to\r\nartificial food is as considerable to herself as beneficial to her\r\ninfant; the demand on her physical strength in the first instance will\r\nbe less severe and exhausting, the child will sleep longer on a less\r\nrapidly digestible aliment, and yield to both more quiet nights, and the\r\nmother will be more at liberty to go out for business or pleasure,\r\nanother means of sustenance being at hand till her return. Besides these\r\nadvantages, by a judicious blending of the two systems of feeding, the\r\ninfant will acquire greater constitutional strength, so that, if\r\nattacked by sickness or disease, it will have a much greater chance of\r\nresisting its virulence than if dependent alone on the mother, whose\r\nmilk, affected by fatigue and the natural anxiety of the parent for her\r\noffspring, is at such a time neither good in its properties nor likely\r\nto be beneficial to the patient.\r\n\r\n2490. All that we have further to say on suckling is an advice to\r\nmothers, that if they wish to keep a sound and unchapped nipple, and\r\npossibly avoid what is called a \"broken breast,\" never to put it up with\r\na wet nipple, but always to have a soft handkerchief in readiness, and\r\nthe moment that delicate part is drawn from the child's mouth, to dry it\r\ncarefully of the milk and saliva that moisten it; and, further, to make\r\na practice of suckling from each breast alternately.\r\n\r\n\r\nDress and Dressing, Washing, &c.\r\n\r\n2491. As respects the dress and dressing of a new-born infant, or of a\r\nchild in arms, during any stage of its nursing, there are few women who\r\nwill require us to give them guidance or directions for their\r\ninstruction; and though a few hints on the subject may not be out of\r\nplace here, yet most women intuitively \"take to a baby,\" and, with a\r\nsmall amount of experience, are able to perform all the little offices\r\nnecessary to its comfort and cleanliness with ease and completeness. We\r\nshall, therefore, on this delicate subject hold our peace; and only,\r\nfrom afar, _hint_ \"at what we would,\" leaving our suggestions to be\r\napproved or rejected, according as they chime with the judgment and the\r\napprehension of our motherly readers.\r\n\r\n2492. In these days of intelligence, there are few ladies who have not,\r\nin all probability, seen the manner in which the Indian squaw, the\r\naborigines of Polynesia, and even the Lapp and Esquimaux, strap down\r\ntheir baby on a board, and by means of a loop suspend it to the bough of\r\na tree, hang it up to the rafters of the hut, or on travel, dangle it on\r\ntheir backs, outside the domestic implements, which, as the slave of her\r\nmaster, man, the wronged but uncomplaining woman carries, in order that\r\nher lord may march in unhampered freedom. Cruel and confining as this\r\nsystem of \"backboard\" dressing may seem to our modern notions of freedom\r\nand exercise, it is positively less irksome, less confining, and\r\ninfinitely less prejudicial to health, than the mummying of children by\r\nour grandmothers a hundred, ay, fifty years ago: for what with\r\nchin-stays, back-stays, body-stays, forehead-cloths, rollers, bandages,\r\n&c., an infant had as many girths and strings, to keep head, limbs, and\r\nbody in one exact position, as a ship has halyards.\r\n\r\n2493. Much of this--indeed we may say all--has been abolished; but still\r\nthe child is far from being dressed loosely enough; and we shall never\r\nbe satisfied till the abominable use of the _pin_ is avoided _in toto_\r\nin an infant's dressing, and a texture made for all the under garments\r\nof a child of a cool and elastic material.\r\n\r\n2494. The manner in which an infant is encircled in a bandage called the\r\n\"roller,\" as if it had fractured ribs, compressing those organs--that,\r\nliving on suction, must be, for the health of the child, to a certain\r\ndegree distended, to obtain sufficient aliment from the fluid\r\nimbibed--is perfectly preposterous. Our humanity, as well as our duty,\r\ncalls upon us at once to abrogate and discountenance by every means in\r\nour power. Instead of the process of washing and dressing being made, as\r\nwith the adult, a refreshment and comfort, it is, by the dawdling manner\r\nin which it is performed, the multiplicity of things used, and the\r\nperpetual change of position of the infant to adjust its complicated\r\nclothing, rendered an operation of positive irritation and annoyance.\r\nWe, therefore, entreat all mothers to regard this subject in its true\r\nlight, and study to the utmost, simplicity in dress, and dispatch in the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n2495. Children do not so much cry from the washing as from the\r\nirritation caused by the frequent change of position in which they are\r\nplaced, the number of times they are turned on their face, on their\r\nback, and on their side, by the manipulations demanded by the\r\nmultiplicity of articles to be fitted, tacked, and carefully adjusted on\r\ntheir bodies. What mother ever found her girl of six or seven stand\r\nquiet while she was curling her hair? How many times nightly has she not\r\nto reprove her for not standing still during the process! It is the same\r\nwith the unconscious infant, who cannot bear to be moved about, and who\r\nhas no sooner grown reconciled to one position than it is forced\r\nreluctantly into another. It is true, in one instance the child has\r\nintelligence to guide it, and in the other not; but the _motitory\r\nnerves_, in both instances, resent coercion, and a child cannot be too\r\nlittle handled.\r\n\r\n2496. On this account alone, and, for the moment, setting health and\r\ncomfort out of the question, we beg mothers to simplify their baby's\r\ndress as much as possible; and not only to put on as little as is\r\nabsolutely necessary, but to make that as simple in its contrivance and\r\nadjustment as it will admit of; to avoid belly-bands, rollers, girths,\r\nand everything that can impede or confine the natural expansion of the\r\ndigestive organs, on the due performance of whose functions the child\r\nlives, thrives, and develops its physical being.\r\n\r\n\r\nREARING BY HAND.\r\n\r\nArticles necessary, and how to use them,--Preparation of Foods.--\r\nBaths.--Advantages of Rearing by Hand.\r\n\r\n2497. As we do not for a moment wish to be thought an advocate for an\r\nartificial, in preference to the natural course of rearing children, we\r\nbeg our renders to understand us perfectly on this head; all we desire\r\nto prove is the fact that a child _can_ be brought up as well on a spoon\r\ndietary as the best example to be found of those reared on the breast;\r\nhaving more strength, indeed, from the more nutritious food on which it\r\nlives. It will be thus less liable to infectious diseases, and more\r\ncapable of resisting the virulence of any danger that may attack it; and\r\nwithout in any way depreciating the nutriment of its natural food, we\r\nwish to impress on the mother's mind that there are many cases of\r\ninfantine debility which might eventuate in rickets, curvature of the\r\nspine, or mesenteric disease, where the addition to, or total\r\nsubstitution of, an artificial and more stimulating aliment, would not\r\nonly give tone and strength to the constitution, but at the same time\r\nrender the employment of mechanical means totally unnecessary. And,\r\nfinally, though we would never--where the mother had the strength to\r\nsuckle her child--supersede the breast, we would insist on making it a\r\nrule to accustom the child as early as possible to the use of an\r\nartificial diet, not only that it may acquire more vigour to help it\r\nover the ills of childhood, but that, in the absence of the mother, it\r\nmight not miss the maternal sustenance; and also for the parent's sake,\r\nthat, should the milk, from any cause, become vitiated, or suddenly\r\ncease, the child can be made over to the bottle and the spoon without\r\nthe slightest apprehension of hurtful consequences.\r\n\r\n2498. To those persons unacquainted with the system, or who may have\r\nbeen erroneously informed on the matter, the rearing of a child by hand\r\nmay seem surrounded by innumerable difficulties, and a large amount of\r\npersonal trouble and anxiety to the nurse or mother who undertakes the\r\nduty. This, however, is a fallacy in every respect, except as regards\r\nthe fact of preparing the food; but even this extra amount of work, by\r\nadopting the course we shall lay down, may be reduced to a very small\r\nsum of inconvenience; and as respects anxiety, the only thing calling\r\nfor care is the display of judgment in the preparation of the food. The\r\narticles required for the purpose of feeding an infant are a night-lamp,\r\nwith its pan and lid, to keep the food warm; a nursing-bottle, with a\r\nprepared teat; and a small pap saucepan, for use by day. Of the lamp we\r\nneed hardly speak, most mothers being acquainted with its operation: but\r\nto those to whom it is unknown we may observe, that the flame from the\r\nfloating rushlight heats the water in the reservoir above, in which the\r\ncovered pan that contains the food floats, keeping it at such a heat\r\nthat, when thinned by milk, it will be of a temperature suitable for\r\nimmediate use. Though many kinds of nursing-bottles have been lately\r\ninvented, and some mounted with India-rubber nipples, the common glass\r\nbottle, with the calf's teat, is equal in cleanliness and utility to\r\nany; besides, the nipple put into the child's mouth is so white and\r\nnatural in appearance, that no child taken from the breast will refuse\r\nit. The black artificial ones of caoutchouc or gutta-percha are\r\nunnatural. The prepared teats can be obtained at any chemist's, and as\r\nthey are kept in spirits, they will require a little soaking in warm\r\nwater, and gentle washing, before being tied securely, by means of fine\r\ntwine, round the neck of the bottle, just sufficient being left\r\nprojecting for the child to grasp freely in its lips; for if left the\r\nfull length, or over long, it will be drawn too far into the mouth, and\r\npossibly make the infant heave. When once properly adjusted, the nipple\r\nneed never be removed till replaced by a new one, which will hardly be\r\nnecessary oftener than once a fortnight, though with care one will last\r\nfor several weeks. The nursing-bottle should be thoroughly washed and\r\ncleaned every day, and always rinsed out before and after using it, the\r\nwarm water being squeezed through the nipple, to wash out any particles\r\nof food that might lodge in the aperture, and become sour. The teat can\r\nalways be kept white and soft by turning the end of the bottle, when not\r\nin use, into a narrow jug containing water, taking care to dry it first,\r\nand then to warm it by drawing the food through before putting it into\r\nthe child's mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFood, and its Preparation.\r\n\r\n2499. The articles generally employed as food for infants consist of\r\narrowroot, bread, flour, baked flour, prepared groats, farinaceous food,\r\nbiscuit-powder, biscuits, tops-and-bottoms, and semolina, or manna\r\ncroup, as it is otherwise called, which, like tapioca, is the prepared\r\npith of certain vegetable substances. Of this list the least\r\nefficacious, though, perhaps, the most believed in, is arrowroot, which\r\nonly as a mere agent, for change, and then only for a very short time,\r\nshould ever be employed as a means of diet to infancy or childhood. It\r\nis a thin, flatulent, and innutritious food, and incapable of supporting\r\ninfantine life with energy. Bread, though the universal _régime_ with\r\nthe labouring poor, where the infant's stomach and digestive powers are\r\na reflex, in miniature, of the father's, should never be given to an\r\ninfant under three months, and, even then, however finely beaten up and\r\nsmoothly made, is a very questionable diet. Flour, when well boiled,\r\nthough infinitely better than arrowroot, is still only a kind of\r\nfermentative paste, that counteracts its own good by after-acidity and\r\nflatulence.\r\n\r\n2500. Baked flour, when cooked into a pale brown mass, and finely\r\npowdered, makes a far superior food to the others, and may be considered\r\nas a very useful diet, especially for a change. Prepared groats may be\r\nclassed with arrowroot and raw flour, as being innutritious. The\r\narticles that now follow in our list are all good, and such as we could,\r\nwith conscience and safety, trust to for the health and development of\r\nany child whatever.\r\n\r\n2501. We may observe in this place, that an occasional change in the\r\ncharacter of the food is highly desirable, both as regards the health\r\nand benefit of the child; and though the interruption should only last\r\nfor a day, the change will be advantageous.\r\n\r\n2502. The packets sold as farinaceous food are unquestionably the best\r\naliment that can be given from the first to a baby, and may be\r\ncontinued, with the exception of an occasional change, without\r\nalteration of the material, till the child is able to take its regular\r\nmeals of animal and vegetable food. Some infants are so constituted as\r\nto require a frequent and total change in their system of living,\r\nseeming to thrive for a certain time on any food given to them, but if\r\npersevered in too long, declining in bulk and appearance as rapidly as\r\nthey had previously progressed. In such cases the food should be\r\nimmediately changed, and when that which appeared to agree best with the\r\nchild is resumed, it should be altered in its quality, and perhaps in\r\nits consistency.\r\n\r\n2503. For the farinaceous food there are directions with each packet,\r\ncontaining instructions for the making; but, whatever the food employed\r\nis, enough should be made at once to last the day and night; at first,\r\nabout a pint basinful, but, as the child advances, a quart will hardly\r\nbe too much. In all cases, let the food boil a sufficient time,\r\nconstantly stirring, and taking every precaution that it does not get\r\nburnt, in which case it is on no account to be used.\r\n\r\n2504. The food should always be made with water, the whole sweetened at\r\nonce, and of such a consistency that, when poured out, and it has had\r\ntime to cool, it will cut with the firmness of a pudding or custard. One\r\nor two spoonfuls are to be put into the pap saucepan and stood on the\r\nhob till the heat has softened it, when enough milk is to be added, and\r\ncarefully mixed with the food, till the whole has the consistency of\r\nordinary cream; it is then to be poured into the nursing-bottle, and the\r\nfood having been drawn through to warm the nipple, it is to be placed in\r\nthe child's mouth. For the first month or more, half a bottleful will be\r\nquite enough to give the infant at one time; but, as the child grows, it\r\nwill be necessary not only to increase the quantity given at each time,\r\nbut also gradually to make its food more consistent, and, after the\r\nthird month, to add an egg to every pint basin of food made. At night\r\nthe mother puts the food into the covered pan of her lamp, instead of\r\nthe saucepan--that is, enough for one supply, and, having lighted the\r\nrush, she will find, on the waking of her child, the food sufficiently\r\nhot to bear the cooling addition of the milk. But, whether night or day,\r\nthe same food should never be heated twice, and what the child leaves\r\nshould be thrown away.\r\n\r\n2505. The biscuit powder is used in the same manner as the farinaceous\r\nfood, and both prepared much after the fashion of making starch. But\r\nwhen tops-and-bottoms, or the whole biscuit, are employed, they require\r\nsoaking in cold water for some time previous to boiling. The biscuit or\r\nbiscuits are then to be slowly boiled in as much water as will, when\r\nthoroughly soft, allow of their being beaten by a three-pronged fork\r\ninto a fine, smooth, and even pulp, and which, when poured into a basin\r\nand become cold, will cut out like a custard. If two large biscuits have\r\nbeen so treated, and the child is six or seven months old, beat up two\r\neggs, sufficient sugar to properly sweeten it, and about a pint of skim\r\nmilk. Pour this on the beaten biscuit in the saucepan, stirring\r\nconstantly; boil for about five minutes, pour into a basin, and use,\r\nwhen cold, in the same manner as the other.\r\n\r\n2506. This makes an admirable food, at once nutritious and\r\nstrengthening. When tops-and-bottoms or rusks are used, the quantity of\r\nthe egg may be reduced, or altogether omitted.\r\n\r\n2507. Semolina, or manna croup, being in little hard grains, like a fine\r\nmillet-seed, must be boiled for some time, and the milk, sugar, and egg\r\nadded to it on the fire, and boiled for a few minutes longer, and, when\r\ncold, used as the other preparations.\r\n\r\n2508. Many persons entertain a belief that cow's milk is hurtful to\r\ninfants, and, consequently, refrain from giving it; but this is a very\r\ngreat mistake, for both sugar and milk should form a large portion of\r\nevery meal an infant takes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEETHING AND CONVULSIONS.\r\n\r\nFits, &c., the consequence of Dentition, and how to be treated.--The\r\nnumber and order of the Teeth, and manner in which they are cut.--First\r\nand Second Set.\r\n\r\n2509. About three months after birth, the infant's troubles may be said\r\nto begin; teeth commence forming in the gums, causing pain and\r\nirritation in the mouth, and which, but for the saliva it causes to flow\r\nso abundantly, would be attended with very serious consequences. At the\r\nsame time the mother frequently relaxes in the punctuality of the\r\nregimen imposed on her, and, taking some unusual or different food,\r\nexcites diarrhoea or irritation in her child's stomach, which not\r\nunfrequently results in a rash on the skin, or slight febrile symptoms,\r\nwhich, if not subdued in their outset, superinduce some more serious\r\nform of infantine disease. But, as a general rule, the teeth are the\r\nprimary cause of much of the child's sufferings, in consequence of the\r\nstate of nervous and functional irritation into which the system is\r\nthrown by their formation and progress out of the jaw and through the\r\ngums. We propose beginning this branch of our subject with that most\r\nfertile source of an infant's suffering--\r\n\r\nTeething.\r\n\r\n2510. That this subject may he better understood by the nurse and\r\nmother, and the reason of the constitutional disturbance that, to a\r\ngreater or less degree, is experienced by all infants, may be made\r\nintelligible to those who have the care of children, we shall commence\r\nby giving a brief account of the formation of the teeth, the age at\r\nwhich they appear in the mouth, and the order in which they pierce the\r\ngums. The organs of mastication in the adult consist of 32 distinct\r\nteeth, 16 in either jaw; being, in fact, a double set. The teeth are\r\ndivided into 4 incisors, 2 canine, 4 first and second grinders, and 6\r\nmolars; but in childhood the complement or first set consists of only\r\ntwenty, and these only make their appearance as the development of the\r\nframe indicates the requirement of a different kind of food for the\r\nsupport of the system. At birth some of the first-cut teeth are found in\r\nthe cavities of the jaw, in a very small and rudimentary form; but this\r\nis by no means universal. About the third month, the jaws, which are\r\nhollow and divided into separate cells, begin to expand, making room for\r\nthe slowly developing teeth, which, arranged for beauty and economy of\r\nspace lengthwise, gradually turn their tops upwards, piercing the gum by\r\ntheir edges, which, being sharp, assist in cutting a passage through the\r\nsoft parts. There is no particular period at which children cut their\r\nteeth, some being remarkably early, and others equally late. The\r\nearliest age that we have ever ourselves known as a reliable fact was,\r\n_six weeks_. Such peculiarities are generally hereditary, and, as in\r\nthis case, common to a whole family. The two extremes are probably\r\nrepresented by six and sixteen months. Pain and drivelling are the\r\nusual, but by no means the general, indications of teething.\r\n\r\n2511. About the sixth month the gums become tense and swollen,\r\npresenting a red, shiny appearance, while the salivary glands pour out\r\nan unusual quantity of saliva. After a time, a white line or round spot\r\nis observed on the top of one part of the gums, and the sharp edge of\r\nthe tooth may be felt beneath if the finger is gently pressed on the\r\npart. Through these white spots the teeth burst their way in the\r\nfollowing order:--\r\n\r\n2512. Two incisors in the lower jaw are first cut, though, in general,\r\nsome weeks elapse between the appearance of the first and the advent of\r\nthe second. The next teeth cut are the four incisors of the upper jaw.\r\nThe next in order are the remaining two incisors of the bottom, one on\r\neach side, then two top and two bottom on each side, but not joining the\r\nincisors; and lastly, about the eighteenth or twentieth month, the four\r\neye teeth, filling up the space left between the side teeth and the\r\nincisors; thus completing the infant's set of sixteen. Sometimes at the\r\nsame period, but more frequently some months later, four more double\r\nteeth slowly make their appearance, one on each side of each jaw,\r\ncompleting the entire series of the child's first set of twenty teeth.\r\nIt is asserted that a child, while cutting its teeth, should either\r\ndribble excessively, vomit after every meal, or be greatly relaxed.\r\nThough one or other, or all of these at once, may attend a case of\r\nteething, it by no means follows that any one of them should accompany\r\nthis process of nature, though there can be no doubt that where the pain\r\nconsequent on the unyielding state of the gums, and the firmness of the\r\nskin that covers the tooth, is severe, a copious discharge of saliva\r\nacts beneficially in saving the head, and also in guarding the child\r\nfrom those dangerous attacks of fits to which many children in their\r\nteething are liable.\r\n\r\n2513. _The Symptoms_ that generally indicate the cutting of teeth, in\r\naddition to the inflamed and swollen state of the gums, and increased\r\nflow of saliva, are the restless and peevish state of the child, the\r\nhands being thrust into the mouth, and the evident pleasure imparted by\r\nrubbing the finger or nail gently along the gum; the lips are often\r\nexcoriated, and the functions of the stomach or bowels are out of order.\r\nIn severe cases, occurring in unhealthy or scrofulous children, there\r\nare, from the first, considerable fever, disturbed sleep, fretfulness,\r\ndiarrhoea, rolling of the eyes, convulsive startings, laborious\r\nbreathing, coma, or unnatural sleep, ending, unless the head is quickly\r\nrelieved, in death.\r\n\r\n2514. The _Treatment_ in all cases of painful teething is remarkably\r\nsimple, and consists in keeping the body cool by mild aperient\r\nmedicines, allaying the irritation in the gums by friction with a rough\r\nivory ring or a stale crust of broad, and when the head, lungs, or any\r\norgan is overloaded or unduly excited, to use the hot bath, and by\r\nthrowing the body into a perspiration, equalize the circulation, and\r\nrelieve the system from the danger of a fatal termination.\r\n\r\n2515. Besides these, there is another means, but that must be employed\r\nby a medical man; namely, scarifying the gums--an operation always safe,\r\nand which, when judiciously performed, and at a critical opportunity,\r\nwill often snatch the child from the grasp of death.\r\n\r\n2516. There are few subjects on which mothers have often formed such\r\nstrong and mistaken opinions as on that of lancing an infant's gums,\r\nsome rather seeing their child go into fits--and by the unrelieved\r\nirritation endangering inflammation of the brain, water on the head,\r\nrickets, and other lingering affections--than permit the surgeon to\r\nafford instant relief by cutting through the hard skin, which, like a\r\nbladder over the stopper of a bottle, effectually confines the tooth to\r\nthe socket, and prevents it piercing the soft, spongy substance of the\r\ngum. This prejudice is a great error, as we shall presently show; for,\r\nso far from hurting the child, there is nothing that will so soon\r\nconvert an infant's tears into smiles as scarifying the gums in painful\r\nteething; that is, if effectually done, and the skin of the tooth be\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\n2517. Though teething is a natural function, and to an infant in perfect\r\nhealth should be unproductive of pain, yet in general it is not only a\r\nfertile cause of suffering, but often a source of alarm and danger; the\r\nformer, from irritation in the stomach and bowels, deranging the whole\r\neconomy of the system, and the latter, from coma and fits, that may\r\nexcite alarm in severe cases; and the danger, that eventuates in some\r\ninstances, from organic disease of the head or spinal marrow.\r\n\r\n2518. We shall say nothing in this place of \"rickets,\" or \"water on the\r\nhead,\" which are frequent results of dental irritation, but proceed to\r\nfinish our remarks on the treatment of teething. Though strongly\r\nadvocating the lancing of the gums in teething, and when there are any\r\nsevere head-symptoms, yet it should never be needlessly done, or before\r\nbeing satisfied that the tooth is fully formed, and is out of the\r\nsocket, and under the gum. When assured on these points, the gum should\r\nbe cut lengthwise, and from the top of the gum downwards to the tooth,\r\nin an horizontal direction, thus----, and for about half an inch in\r\nlength. The operation is then to be repeated in a transverse direction,\r\ncutting across the gum, in the centre of the first incision, and forming\r\na cross, thus +. The object of this double incision is to insure a\r\nretraction of the cut parts, and leave an open way for the tooth to\r\nstart from--an advantage not to be obtained when only one incision is\r\nmade; for unless the tooth immediately follows the lancing, the opening\r\nreunites, and the operation has to be repeated. That this operation is\r\nvery little or not at all painful, is evidenced by the suddenness with\r\nwhich the infant falls asleep after the lancing, and awakes in\r\napparently perfect health, though immediately before the use of the\r\ngum-lancet, the child may have been shrieking or in convulsions.\r\n\r\n\r\nConvulsions, or Infantine Fits.\r\n\r\n2519. From their birth till after teething, infants are more or less\r\nsubject or liable to sudden fits, which often, without any assignable\r\ncause, will attack the child in a moment, and while in the mother's\r\narms; and which, according to their frequency, and the age and strength\r\nof the infant, are either slight or dangerous.\r\n\r\n2520. Whatever may have been the remote cause, the immediate one is some\r\nirritation of the nervous system, causing convulsions, or an effusion to\r\nthe head, inducing coma. In the first instance, the infant cries out\r\nwith a quick, short scream, rolls up its eyes, arches its body\r\nbackwards, its arms become bent and fixed, and the fingers parted; the\r\nlips and eyelids assume a dusky leaden colour, while the face remains\r\npale, and the eyes open, glassy, or staring. This condition may or may\r\nnot be attended with muscular twitchings of the mouth, and convulsive\r\nplunges of the arms. The fit generally lasts from one to three minutes,\r\nwhen the child recovers with a sigh, and the relaxation of the body. In\r\nthe other case, the infant is attacked at once with total insensibility\r\nand relaxation of the limbs, coldness of the body and suppressed\r\nbreathing; the eyes, when open, being dilated, and presenting a dim\r\nglistening appearance; the infant appearing, for the moment, to be dead.\r\n\r\n2521. _Treatment._-The first step in either case is, to immerse the\r\nchild in a hot bath up to the chin; or if sufficient hot water cannot be\r\nprocured to cover the body, make a hip-bath of what can be obtained;\r\nand, while the left hand supports the child in a sitting or recumbent\r\nposition, with the right scoop up the water, and run it over the chest\r\nof the patient. When sufficient water can be obtained, the spine should\r\nbe briskly rubbed while in the bath; when this cannot be done, lay the\r\nchild on the knees, and with the fingers dipped in brandy, rub the whole\r\nlength of the spine vigorously for two or three minutes, and when\r\nrestored to consciousness, give occasionally a teaspoonful of weak\r\nbrandy and water or wine and water.\r\n\r\n2522. An hour after the bath, it may be necessary to give an aperient\r\npowder, possibly also to repeat the dose for once or twice every three\r\nhours; in which case the following prescription is to be employed. Take\r\nof\r\n\r\n  Powdered scammony       6 grains.\r\n  Grey powder             6 grains.\r\n  Antimonial powder       4 grains.\r\n  Lump sugar             20 grains.\r\n\r\nMix thoroughly, and divide into three powders, which are to be taken as\r\nadvised for an infant one year old; for younger or weakly infants,\r\ndivide into four powders, and give as the other. For thirst and febrile\r\nsymptoms, give drinks of barley-water, or cold water, and every three\r\nhours put ten to fifteen drops of spirits of sweet nitre in a\r\ndessert-spoonful of either beverage.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHRUSH, AND ITS TREATMENT.\r\n\r\n2523. This is a disease to which infants are peculiarly subject, and in\r\nwhom alone it may be said to be a disease; for when thrush shows itself\r\nin adult or advanced life, it is not as a disease proper, but only as a\r\nsymptom, or accessory, of some other ailment, generally of a chronic\r\ncharacter, and should no more be classed as a separate affection than\r\nthe petechae, or dark-coloured spots that appear in malignant measles,\r\nmay be considered a distinct affection.\r\n\r\n2524. Thrush is a disease of the follicles of the mucous membrane of the\r\nalimentary canal, whereby there are formed small vesicles, or bladders,\r\nfilled with a thick mucous secretion, which, bursting, discharge their\r\ncontents, and form minute ulcers in the centre of each vessel. To make\r\nthis formal but unavoidable description intelligible, we must beg the\r\nreader's patience while we briefly explain terms that may appear to many\r\nso unmeaning, and make the pathology of thrush fully familiar.\r\n\r\n2525. The whole digestive canal, of which the stomach and bowels are\r\nonly a part, is covered, from the lips, eyes, and ears downwards, with a\r\nthin glairy tissue, like the skin that lines the inside of an egg,\r\ncalled the mucous membrane; this membrane is dotted all over, in a state\r\nof health, by imperceptible points, called follicles, through which the\r\nsaliva, or mucous secreted by the membrane, is poured out.\r\n\r\n2526. These follicles, or little glands, then, becoming enlarged, and\r\nfilled with a congealed fluid, constitute thrush in its first stage; and\r\nwhen the child's lips and mouth appear a mass of small pearls, then, as\r\nthese break and discharge, the second stage, or that of ulceration, sets\r\nin.\r\n\r\n2527. _Symptoms._--Thrush is generally preceded by considerable\r\nirritation, by the child crying and fretting, showing more than ordinary\r\nredness of the lips and nostrils, hot fetid breath, with relaxed bowels,\r\nand dark feculent evacuations; the water is scanty and high-coloured;\r\nwhilst considerable difficulty in swallowing, and much thirst, are the\r\nother symptoms, which a careful observation of the little patient makes\r\nmanifest.\r\n\r\n2528. The situation and character of thrush show at once that the cause\r\nis some irritation of the mucous membrane, and can proceed only from the\r\nnature and quality of the food. Before weaning, this must be looked for\r\nin the mother, and the condition of the milk; after that time, in the\r\ncrude and indigestible nature of the food given. In either case, this\r\nexciting cause of the disease must be at once stopped. When it proceeds\r\nfrom the mother, it is always best to begin by physicking the infant\r\nthrough the parent; that is to say, let the parent first take the\r\nmedicine, which will sufficiently affect the child through the milk:\r\nthis plan has the double object of benefiting the patient and, at the\r\nsame time, correcting the state of the mother, and improving the\r\ncondition of her milk. In the other case, when the child is being fed by\r\nhand, then proceed by totally altering the style of aliment given, and\r\nsubstituting farinaceous food, custards, blanc-mange, and ground-rice\r\npuddings.\r\n\r\n2529. As an aperient medicine for the mother, the best thing she can\r\ntake is a dessert-spoonful of carbonate of magnesia once or twice a day,\r\nin a cup of cold water; and every second day, for two or three times, an\r\naperient pill.\r\n\r\n2530. As the thrush extends all over the mouth, throat, stomach, and\r\nbowels, the irritation to the child from such an extent of diseased\r\nsurface is proportionately great, and before attempting to act on such a\r\ntender surface by opening medicine, the better plan is to soothe by an\r\nemollient mixture; and, for that purpose, let the following be prepared.\r\nTake of\r\n\r\n  Castor oil                          2 drachms.\r\n  Sugar                               1 drachm.\r\n  Mucilage, or powdered gum Arabic    half a drachm.\r\n\r\nTriturate till the oil is incorporated, then add slowly--\r\n\r\n  Mint-water            One ounce and a half\r\n  Laudanum              Ten drops\r\n\r\nHalf a teaspoonful three times a day, to an infant from one to two years\r\nold; a teaspoonful from two to three years old; and a dessertspoonful at\r\nany age over that time. After two days' use of the mixture, one of the\r\nfollowing powders should be given twice a day, accompanied with one dose\r\ndaily of the mixture:--\r\n\r\n  Grey powder              20 grains.\r\n  Powdered rhubarb         15 grains.\r\n  Scammony                 10 grains. Mix.\r\n\r\nDivide into twelve powders, for one year; eight powders, from one to\r\ntwo; and six powders, from two to six years old. After that age, double\r\nthe strength, by giving the quantity of two powders at once.\r\n\r\n2531. It is sometimes customary to apply borax and honey to the mouth\r\nfor thrush; but it is always better to treat the disease\r\nconstitutionally rather than locally. The first steps, therefore, to be\r\nadopted are, to remove or correct the exciting cause--the mother's milk\r\nor food; allay irritation by a warm bath and the castor-oil mixture,\r\nfollowed by and conjoined with the powders.\r\n\r\n2532. To those, however, who wish to try the honey process, the best\r\npreparation to use is the following:-Rub down one ounce of honey with\r\ntwo drachms of tincture of myrrh, and apply it to the lips and mouth\r\nevery four or six hours.\r\n\r\n2533. It is a popular belief, and one most devoutly cherished by many\r\nnurses and elderly persons, that everybody must, at some time of their\r\nlife, between birth and death, have an attack of thrush, and if not in\r\ninfancy, or prime of life, it will surely attack them on their\r\ndeath-bed, in a form more malignant than if the patient had been\r\naffected with the malady earlier; the black thrush with which they are\r\nthen reported to be affected being, in all probability, the petechae or\r\npurple spots that characterize the worst form, and often the last stage,\r\nof typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n2534. In general, very little medicine is needed in this disease of the\r\nthrush--an alterative powder, or a little magnesia, given once or twice,\r\nbeing all, with the warm bath, that, in the great majority of cases, is\r\nneeded to restore the mucous membrane to health. As thrush is caused by\r\nan excess of heat, or over-action in the lining membrane of the stomach\r\nand bowels, whatever will counteract this state, by throwing the heat on\r\nthe surface, must materially benefit, if not cure, the disease: and that\r\nmeans every mother has at hand, in the form of a _warm bath_. After the\r\napplication of this, a little magnesia to correct the acidity existing\r\nalong the surface of the mucous membrane, is often all that is needed to\r\nthrow the system into such a state as will effect its own cure. This\r\nfavourable state is indicated by an excessive flow of saliva, or what is\r\ncalled \"dribbling,\" and by a considerable amount of relaxation of the\r\nbowels-a condition that must not be mistaken for diarrhoea, and checked\r\nas if a disease, but rather, for the day or two it continues, encouraged\r\nas a critical evacuant.\r\n\r\n2535. Should there be much debility in the convalescence, half a\r\nteaspoonful of stee wine, given twice a day in a little barley-water,\r\nwill be found sufficient for all the purposes of a tonic. This, with the\r\nprecaution of changing the child's food, or, when it lives on the\r\nmother, of correcting the quality of the milk by changing her own diet,\r\nand, by means of an antacid or aperient, improving the state of the\r\nsecretion. Such is all the treatment that this disease in general\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\n2536. The class of diseases we are now approaching are the most\r\nimportant, both in their pathological features and in their consequences\r\non the constitution, of any group or individual disease that assails the\r\nhuman body; and though more frequently attacking the undeveloped frame\r\nof childhood, are yet by no means confined to that period. These are\r\ncalled Eruptive Fevers, and embrace chicken-pox, cow-pox, small-pox,\r\nscarlet fever, measles, milary fever, and erysipelas, or St. Anthony's\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n2537. The general character of all these is, that they are contagious,\r\nand, as a general rule, attack a person only once in his lifetime; that\r\ntheir chain of diseased actions always begins with fever, and that,\r\nafter an interval of from one to four days, the fever is followed by an\r\neruption of the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICKEN-POX, OR GLASS-POX; AND COW-POX, OR VACCINATION.\r\n\r\n2538. CHICKEN-POX, or GLASS-POX, may, in strict propriety, be classed as\r\na mild variety of small-pox, presenting all the mitigated symptoms of\r\nthat formidable disease. Among many physicians it is, indeed, classed as\r\nsmall-pox, and not a separate disease; but as this is not the place to\r\ndiscuss such questions, and as we profess to give only facts, the result\r\nof our own practical experience, we shall treat this affection of\r\nglass-pox or chicken-pox, as we ourselves have found it, as a distinct\r\nand separate disease.\r\n\r\n2539. Chicken-pox is marked by all the febrile symptoms presented by\r\nsmall-pox, with this difference, that, in the case of chicken-pox, each\r\nsymptom is particularly slight. The heat of body is much less acute, and\r\nthe principal symptoms are difficulty of breathing, headache, coated\r\ntongue, and nausea, which sometimes amounts to vomiting. After a term of\r\ngeneral irritability, heat, and restlessness, about the fourth day, or\r\nbetween the third and fourth, an eruption makes its appearance over the\r\nface, neck, and body, in its first two stages closely resembling\r\nsmall-pox, with this especial difference, that whereas the pustules in\r\nsmall-pox have _flat_ and _depressed_ centres--an infallible\r\ncharacteristic of small-pox--the pustules in chicken-pox remain\r\n_globular_, while the fluid in them changes from a transparent white to\r\na straw-coloured liquid, which begins to exude and disappear about the\r\neighth or ninth day, and, in mild cases, by the twelfth desquamates, or\r\npeels off entirely.\r\n\r\n2540. There can be no doubt that chicken-pox, like small-pox, is\r\ncontagious, and under certain states of the atmosphere becomes endemic.\r\nParents should, therefore, avoid exposing young children to the danger\r\nof infection by taking them where it is known to exist, as chicken-pox,\r\nin weakly constitutions, or in very young children, may superinduce\r\nsmall-pox, the one disease either running concurrently with the other,\r\nor discovering itself as the other declines. This, of course, is a\r\ncondition that renders the case very hazardous, as the child has to\r\nstruggle against two diseases at once, or before it has recruited\r\nstrength from the attack of the first.\r\n\r\n2541. _Treatment_.--In all ordinary cases of chicken-pox--and it is very\r\nseldom it assumes any complexity--the whole treatment resolves itself\r\ninto the use of the warm bath, and a course of gentle aperients. The\r\nbath should be used when the oppression of the lungs renders the\r\nbreathing difficult, or the heat and dryness of the skin, with the\r\nundeveloped rash beneath the surface, shows the necessity for its use.\r\n\r\n2542. As the pustules in chicken-pox very rarely run to the state of\r\nsuppuration, as in the other disease, there is no fear of _pitting_ or\r\ndisfigurement, except in very severe forms, which, however, happen so\r\nseldom as not to merit apprehension. When the eruption subsides,\r\nhowever, the face may be washed with elder-flower water, and the routine\r\nfollowed which is prescribed in the convalescent state of small-pox.\r\n\r\n2543. COW-POX, properly speaking, is an artificial disease, established\r\nin a healthy body as a prophylactic, or preventive agent, against the\r\nmore serious attack of small-pox, and is merely that chain of slight\r\nfebrile symptoms and local irritation, consequent on the specific action\r\nof the lymph of the vaccination, in its action on the circulating system\r\nof the body. This is not the place to speak of the benefits conferred on\r\nmankind by the discovery of vaccination, not only as the preserver of\r\nthe human features from a most loathsome disfigurement, but as a\r\nsanitary agent in the prolongation of life.\r\n\r\n2544. Fortunately the State has now made it imperative on all parents to\r\nhave their children vaccinated before, or by the end of, the twelfth\r\nweek; thus doing away, as far as possible, with the danger to public\r\nhealth proceeding from the ignorance or prejudice of those parents whose\r\nwant of information on the subject makes them object to the employment\r\nof this specific preventive; for though vaccination has been proved\r\n_not_ to be _always_ an infallible guard against small-pox, the attack\r\nis always much lighter, should it occur, and is seldom, if indeed\r\n_ever_, fatal after the precaution of vaccination. The best time to\r\nvaccinate a child is after the sixth and before the twelfth week, if it\r\nis in perfect health, but still earlier if small-pox is prevalent, and\r\nany danger exists of the infant taking the disease. It is customary, and\r\nalways advisable, to give the child a mild aperient powder one or two\r\ndays before inserting the lymph in the arm; and should measles, scarlet\r\nfever, or any other disease arise during the progress of the pustule,\r\nthe child, when recovered, should be _re-vaccinated_, and the lymph\r\ntaken from its arm on no account used for vaccinating purposes.\r\n\r\n2545. The disease of cow-pox generally takes twenty days to complete its\r\ncourse; in other words, the maturity and declension of the pustule takes\r\nthat time to fulfil its several changes. The mode of vaccination is\r\neither to insert the matter, or lymph, taken from a healthy child, under\r\nthe cuticle in several places on both arms, or, which is still better,\r\nto make three slight scratches, or abrasions, with a lancet on one arm\r\nin this manner, ,,\",, and work into the irritated parts the lymph,\r\nallowing the arm to dry thoroughly before putting down the infant's\r\nsleeve; by this means absorption is insured, and the unnecessary pain of\r\nseveral pustules on both arms avoided. No apparent change is observable\r\nby the eye for several days; indeed, not till the fourth, in many cases,\r\nis there any evidence of a vesicle; about the fifth day, however, a pink\r\nareola, or circle, is observed round one or all of the places,\r\nsurrounding a small pearly vesicle or bladder. This goes on deepening in\r\nhue till the seventh or eighth day, when the vesicle is about an inch in\r\ndiameter, with a depressed centre; on the ninth the edges are elevated,\r\nand the surrounding part hard and inflamed. The disease is now at its\r\nheight, and the pustule should be opened, if not for the purpose of\r\nvaccinating other children, to allow the escape of the lymph, and subdue\r\nthe inflammatory action. After the twelfth day the centre is covered by\r\na brown scab, and the colour of the swelling becomes darker, gradually\r\ndeclining in hardness and colour till the twentieth, when the scab\r\nfalls, off, leaving a small pit, or cicatrix, to mark the seat of the\r\ndisease, and for life prove a certificate of successful vaccination.\r\n\r\n2546. In some children the inflammation and swelling of the arm is\r\nexcessive, and extremely painful, and the fever, about the ninth or\r\ntenth day, very high; the pustule, therefore, at that time, should\r\nsometimes be opened, the arm fomented every two hours with a warm bread\r\npoultice, and an aperient powder given to the infant.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASLES AND SCARLET FEVER, WITH THE TREATMENT OF BOTH.\r\n\r\nMeasles.\r\n\r\n2547. This much-dreaded disease, which forms the next subject in our\r\nseries of infantine diseases, and which entails more evils on the health\r\nof childhood than any other description of physical suffering to which\r\nthat age of life is subject, may be considered more an affection of the\r\nvenous circulation, tending to general and local congestion, attended\r\nwith a diseased condition of the blood, than either as a fever or an\r\ninflammation; and though generally classed before or after scarlet\r\nfever, is, in its pathology and treatment, irrespective of its\r\nafter-consequences, as distinct and opposite as one disease can well be\r\nfrom another.\r\n\r\n4548. As we have already observed, measles are always characterized by\r\nthe running at the nose and eyes, and great oppression of breathing; so,\r\nin the mode of treatment, two objects are to be held especially in view;\r\nfirst, to unload the congested state of the lungs,--the cause of the\r\noppressed breathing; and, secondly, to act vigorously, both during the\r\ndisease and afterwards, on the bowels. At the same time it cannot be too\r\nstrongly borne in mind, that though the patient in measles should on no\r\naccount be kept unduly hot, more care than in most infantine complaints\r\nshould be taken to guard the body from _cold_, or any abrupt changes of\r\ntemperature. With these special observations, we shall proceed to give a\r\ndescription of the disease, as recognized by its usual--\r\n\r\n2549. _Symptoms_, which commence with cold chills and flushes,\r\nlassitude, heaviness, pain in the head, and drowsiness, cough,\r\nhoarseness, and extreme difficulty of breathing, frequent sneezing,\r\ndeduction or running at the eyes and nose, nausea, sometimes vomiting,\r\nthirst, a furred tongue; the pulse throughout is quick, and sometimes\r\nfull and soft, at others hard and small, with other indications of an\r\ninflammatory nature.\r\n\r\n2550. On the third day, small red points make their appearance, first on\r\nthe face and neck, gradually extending over the upper and lower part of\r\nthe body. On the fifth day, the vivid red of the eruption changes into a\r\nbrownish hue; and, in two or three days more, the rash entirely\r\ndisappears, leaving a loose powdery desquamation on the skin, which rubs\r\noff like dandriff. At this stage of the disease a diarrhoea frequently\r\ncomes on, which, being what is called \"critical,\" should never be\r\nchecked, unless seriously severe. Measles sometimes assume a typhoid or\r\nmalignant character, in which form the symptoms are all greatly\r\nexaggerated, and the case from the first becomes both doubtful and\r\ndangerous. In this condition the eruption comes out sooner, and only in\r\npatches; and often, after showing for a few hours, suddenly recedes,\r\npresenting, instead of the usual florid red, a dark purple or blackish\r\nhue; a dark brown fur forms on the gums and mouth, the breathing becomes\r\nlaborious, delirium supervenes, and, if unrelieved, is followed by coma;\r\na fetid diarrhoea takes place, and the patient sinks under the congested\r\nstate of the lungs and the oppressed functions of the brain.\r\n\r\n2551. The unfavourable symptoms in measles are a high degree of fever,\r\nthe excessive heat and dryness of the skin, hurried and short breathing,\r\nand a particularly hard pulse. The sequels, or after-consequences, of\r\nmeasles are, croup, bronchitis, mesenteric disease, abscesses behind the\r\near, ophthalmia, and glandular swellings in other parts of the body.\r\n\r\n2552. _Treatment_.--In the first place, the patient should be kept in a\r\ncool room, the temperature of which must be regulated to suit the\r\nchild's feelings of comfort, and the diet adapted to the strictest\r\nprinciples of abstinence. When the inflammatory symptoms are severe,\r\nbleeding, in some form, is often necessary, though, when adopted, it\r\nmust be in the _first stage_ of the disease; and, if the lungs are the\r\napprehended seat of the inflammation, two or more leeches, according to\r\nthe age and strength of the patient, must be applied to the upper part\r\nof the chest, followed by a small blister; or the blister may be\r\nsubstituted for the leeches, the attendant bearing in mind, that the\r\nbenefit effected by the blister can always be considerably augmented by\r\nplunging the feet into very hot water about a couple of hours after\r\napplying the blister, and kept in the water for about two minutes. And\r\nlet it further be remembered, that this immersion of the feet in hot\r\nwater may be adopted at any time or stage of the disease; and that,\r\nwhenever the _head_ or _lungs_ are oppressed, relief will _always_\r\naccrue from its sudden and brief employment. When the symptoms commence\r\nwith much shivering, and the skin early assumes a hot, dry character,\r\nthe appearance of the rash will be facilitated, and all the other\r\nsymptoms rendered milder, if the patient is put into a warm bath, and\r\nkept in the water for about three minutes. Or, where that is not\r\nconvenient, the following process, which will answer quite as well, can\r\nbe substituted:--Stand the child, naked, in a tub, and, having first\r\nprepared several jugs of sufficiently warm water, empty them, in quick\r\nsuccession, over the patient's shoulders and body; immediately wrap in a\r\nhot blanket, and put the child to bed till it rouses from the sleep that\r\nalways follows the effusion or bath. This agent, by lowering the\r\ntemperature of the skin, and opening the pores, producing a natural\r\nperspiration, and unloading the congested state of the lungs, in most\r\ncases does away entirely with the necessity both for leeches and a\r\nblister. Whether any of these external means have been employed or not,\r\nthe first internal remedies should commence with a series of aperient\r\npowders and a saline mixture, as prescribed in the following\r\nformularies; at the same time, as a beverage to quench the thirst, let a\r\nquantity of barley-water be made, slightly acidulated by the juice of an\r\norange, and partially sweetened by some sugar-candy; and of which, when\r\nproperly made and cold, let the patient drink as often as thirst, or the\r\ndryness of the mouth, renders necessary.\r\n\r\n2553. _Aperient Powders_.--Take of scammony and jalap, each 24 grains;\r\ngrey powder and powdered antimony, each 18 grains. Mix and divide into\r\n12 powders, if for a child between two and four years of age; into 8\r\npowders, if for a child between four and eight years of ago; and into 6\r\npowders for between eight and twelve years. One powder to be given, in a\r\nlittle jelly or sugar-and-water, every three or four hours, according to\r\nthe severity of the symptoms.\r\n\r\n2554. _Saline Mixture_.--Take of mint-water, 6 ounces; powdered nitre,\r\n20 grains; antimonial wine, 3 drachms; spirits of nitre, 2 drachms;\r\nsyrup of saffron, 2 drachms. Mix. To children under three years, give a\r\nteaspoonful every two hours; from that age to six, a dessertspoonful at\r\nthe same times; and a tablespoonful every three or four hours to\r\nchildren between six and twelve.\r\n\r\n2555. The object of these aperient powders is to keep up a steady but\r\ngentle action on the bowels; but, whenever it seems necessary to\r\nadminister a stronger dose, and effect a brisk action on the digestive\r\norgans,--a course particularly imperative towards the close of the\r\ndisease,--two of these powders given at once, according to the age, will\r\nbe found to produce that effect; that is, two of the twelve for a child\r\nunder four years, and two of the eight, and two of the six, according to\r\nthe age of the patient.\r\n\r\n2556. When the difficulty of breathing becomes oppressive, as it\r\ngenerally does towards night, a hot bran poultice, laid on the chest,\r\nwill be always found highly beneficial. The diet throughout must be\r\nlight, and consist of farinaceous food, such as rice and sago puddings,\r\nbeef-tea and toast; and not till convalescence sets in should hard or\r\nanimal food be given.\r\n\r\n2557. When measles assume the malignant form, the advice just given must\r\nbe broken through; food of a nutritious and stimulating character should\r\nbe at once substituted, and administered in conjunction with wine, and\r\neven spirits, and the disease regarded and treated as a case of typhus.\r\nBut, as this form of measles is not frequent, and, if occurring, hardly\r\nlikely to be treated without assistance, it is unnecessary to enter on\r\nthe minutiae of its practice here. What we have prescribed, in almost\r\nall cases, will be found sufficient to meet every emergency, without\r\nresorting to a multiplicity of agents.\r\n\r\n2558. The great point to remember in measles is, not to give up the\r\ntreatment with the apparent subsidence of the disease, as the\r\n_after-consequences_ of measles are too often more serious, and to be\r\nmore dreaded, than the measles themselves. To guard against this danger,\r\nand thoroughly purify the system, after the subsidence of all the\r\nsymptoms of the disease, a corrective course of medicine, and a regimen\r\nof exercise, should be adopted for some weeks after the cure of the\r\ndisease. To effect this, an active aperient powder should be given every\r\nthree or four clays, with a daily dose of the subjoined tonic mixture,\r\nwith as much exercise, by walking, running after a hoop, or other bodily\r\nexertion, as the strength of the child and the state of the atmosphere\r\nwill admit, the patient being, wherever possible, removed to a purer air\r\nas soon as convalescence warrants the change.\r\n\r\n2559. _Tonic Mixture_.--Take of infusion of rose-leaves, 6 ounces;\r\nquinine, 8 grains; diluted sulphuric acid, 15 drops. Mix. Dose, from\r\nhalf a teaspoonful up to a dessertspoonful, once a day, according to the\r\nago of the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarlatina, or Scarlet Fever.\r\n\r\n2560. Though professional accuracy has divided this disease into several\r\nforms, we shall keep to the one disease most generally mot with, the\r\ncommon or simple scarlet fever, which, in all cases, is characterized by\r\nan excessive heat on the skin, sore throat, and a peculiar speckled\r\nappearance of the tongue.\r\n\r\n2561. _Symptoms_.--Cold chills, shivering, nausea, thirst, hot skin,\r\nquick pulse, with difficulty of swallowing; the tongue is coated,\r\npresenting through its fur innumerable specks, the elevated papillae of\r\nthe tongue, which gives it the speckled character, that, if not the\r\ninvariable sign of scarlet fever, is only met with in cases closely\r\nanalogous to that disease. Between the _second_ and __third_ day, but\r\nmost frequently on the _third_, a bright red efflorescence breaks out in\r\npatches on the face, neck, and back, from which it extends over the\r\ntrunk and extremities, always showing thicker and deeper in colour\r\nwherever there is any pressure, such as the elbows, back, and hips; when\r\nthe eruption is well out, the skin presents the appearance of a boiled\r\nlobster-shell. At first, the skin is smooth, but, as the disease\r\nadvances, perceptible roughness is apparent, from the elevation of the\r\nrash, or, more properly, the pores of the skin. On the _fifth_ and\r\n_sixth_ days the eruption begins to decline, and by the _eighth_ has\r\ngenerally entirely disappeared. During the whole of this period, there\r\nis, more or less, constant sore throat.\r\n\r\n2562. The _Treatment_ of scarlet fever is, in general, very simple.\r\nWhere the heat is great, and the eruption comes out with difficulty, or\r\nrecedes as soon as it appears, the body should be sponged with cold\r\nvinegar-and-water, or tepid water, as in measles, poured over the chest\r\nand body, the patient being, as in that disease, wrapped in a blanket\r\nand put to bed, and the same powders and mixture ordered in measles\r\nadministered, with the addition of a constant hot bran poultice round\r\nthe throat, which should be continued from the first symptom till a day\r\nor two after the declension of the rash. The same low diet and cooling\r\ndrink, with the same general instructions, are to be obeyed in this as\r\nin the former disease.\r\n\r\n2563. When the fever runs high in the first stage, and there is much\r\nnausea, before employing the effusions of water, give the patient an\r\nemetic, of equal, parts of ipecacuanha and antimonial wine, in doses of\r\nfrom a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful, according to age. By these means,\r\nnine out of every ten cases of scarlatina may be safely and\r\nexpeditiously cured, especially if the temperature of the patient's room\r\nis kept at an even standard of about sixty degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOOPING-COUGH, CROUP, AND DIARRHOEA, WITH THEIR MODE OF TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nHooping-Cough.\r\n\r\n2564. THIS is purely a spasmodic disease, and is only infectious through\r\nthe faculty of imitation, a habit that all children are remarkably apt\r\nto fall into; and even where adults have contracted hooping-cough, it\r\nhas been from the same cause, and is as readily accounted for, on the\r\nprinciple of imitation, as that the gaping of one person will excite or\r\npredispose a whole party to follow the same spasmodic example. If any\r\none associates for a few days with a person who stammers badly, he will\r\nfind, when released from his company, that the sequence of his\r\narticulation and the fluency of his speech are, for a time, gone; and it\r\nwill be a matter of constant vigilance, and some difficulty, to overcome\r\nthe evil of so short an association. The manner in which a number of\r\nschool-girls will, one after another, fall into a fit on beholding one\r\nof their number attacked with epilepsy, must be familiar to many. These\r\nseveral facts lead us to a juster notion of how to treat this spasmodic\r\ndisease. Every effort should, therefore, be directed, mentally and\r\nphysically, to break the chain of nervous action, on which the\r\ncontinuance of the cough depends.\r\n\r\n2565. _Symptoms._--Hooping-cough comes on with a slight oppression of\r\nbreathing, thirst, quick pulse, hoarseness, and a hard, dry cough. This\r\nstate may exist without any change from one to two or three weeks before\r\nthe peculiar feature of the disease-the _hoop_-sets in. As the\r\ncharacteristics of this cough are known to all, it is unnecessary to\r\nenter here, physiologically, on the subject. We shall, therefore, merely\r\nremark that the frequent vomiting and bleeding at the mouth or nose are\r\nfavourable signs, and proceed to the\r\n\r\n2566. _Treatment_, which should consist in keeping up a state of nausea\r\nand vomiting. For this purpose, give the child doses of ipecacuanha and\r\nantimonial wines, in equal parts, and quantities varying from half to\r\none and a half teaspoonful once a day, or, when the expectoration is\r\nhard and difficult of expulsion, giving the following cough mixture\r\nevery four hours. Take of\r\n\r\n  Syrup of squills            1/2 ounce.\r\n  Antimonial wine               1 ounce.\r\n  Laudanum                     15 drops.\r\n  Syrup of Toulou             2 drachms.\r\n  Water                     1-1/2 ounce.\r\n\r\nMix. The dose is from half a spoonful to a dessertspoonful. When the\r\ncough is urgent, the warm bath is to be used, and either one or two\r\nleeches applied over the breastbone, or else a small blister laid on the\r\nlower part of the throat.\r\n\r\n2567. Such is the medical treatment of hooping-cough; but there is a\r\nmoral regimen, based on the nature of the disease, which should never be\r\nomitted. And, on the principle that a sudden start or diversion of the\r\nmind will arrest a person in the act of sneezing or gaping, so the like\r\nmeans should be adopted with the hooping-cough patient; and, in the\r\nfirst stage, before the _hooping_ has been added, the parent should\r\nendeavour to break the paroxysm of the cough by abruptly attracting the\r\npatient's attention, and thus, if possible, preventing the cough from\r\nreaching that height when the ingulp of air gives the hoop or crow that\r\nmarks the disease; but when once that symptom has set in, it becomes\r\nstill more necessary to endeavour, by even measures of intimidation, to\r\nbreak the spasmodic chain of the cough. Exercise in the open air, when\r\ndry, is also requisite, and charge of scene and air in all cases is of\r\nabsolute necessity, and may be adopted at any stage of the disease.\r\n\r\nCroup.\r\n\r\n2568. This is by far the most formidable and fatal of all the diseases\r\nto which infancy and childhood are liable, and is purely an inflammatory\r\naffection, attacking that portion of the mucous membrane lining the\r\nwindpipe and bronchial tubes, and from the effect of which a false or\r\nloose membrane is formed along the windpipe, resembling in appearance\r\nthe finger of a glove suspended in the passage, and, consequently,\r\nterminating the life of the patient by suffocation; for, as the lower\r\nend grows together and becomes closed, no air can enter the lungs, and\r\nthe child dies choked. All dull, fat, and heavy children are peculiarly\r\npredisposed to this disease, and those with short necks and who make a\r\nwheezing noise in their natural breathing. Croup is always sudden in its\r\nattack, and rapid in its career, usually proving fatal within three\r\ndays; most frequently commences in the night, and generally attacking\r\nchildren between the ages of three and ten years. Mothers should,\r\ntherefore, be on their guard who have children predisposed to this\r\ndisease, and immediately resort to the means hereafter advised.\r\n\r\n2569. _Symptoms_.--Languor and restlessness, hoarseness, wheezing, and\r\nshort, dry cough, with occasional rattling in the throat during sleep,\r\nthe child often plucking at its throat with its fingers; difficulty of\r\nbreathing, which quickly becomes hard and laboured, causing great\r\nanxiety of the countenance, and the veins of the neck to swell and\r\nbecome knotted; the voice in speaking acquires a sharp, crowing, or\r\ncroupy sound, while the inspirations have a harsh, metallic intonation.\r\nAfter a few hours, a quantity of thick, ropy mucus is thrown out,\r\nhanging about the mouth, and causing suffocating fits of coughing to\r\nexpel.\r\n\r\n2570. Treatment.--Place the child immediately in a hot bath up to the\r\nthroat; and, on removal from the water, give an emetic of the antimonial\r\nor ipecacuanha wine, and, when the vomiting has subsided, lay a long\r\nblister down the front of the throat, and administer one of the\r\nfollowing powders every twenty minutes to a child from three to six\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\n2571. Take of calomel, 12 grains; tartar emetic, 2 grains; lump sugar,\r\n30 grains. Mix accurately, and divide into 12 powders. For a child from\r\nsix to twelve years, divide into 6 powders, and give one every\r\nhalf-hour.\r\n\r\n2572. Should the symptoms remain unabated after a few hours, apply one\r\nor two leeches to the throat, and put mustard poultices to the foot and\r\nthighs, retaining them about eight minutes; and, in extreme cases, a\r\nmustard poultice to the spine between the shoulders, and at the same\r\ntime rub mercurial ointment into the armpits and the angles of the jaws.\r\n\r\n2573. Such is a vigorous and reliable system of treatment in severe\r\ncases of croup; but, in the milder and more general form, the following\r\nabridgment will, in all probability, be all that will be\r\nrequired:--First, the hot bath; second, the emetic; third, a mustard\r\nplaster round the throat for five minutes; fourth, the powders; fifth,\r\nanother emetic in six hours, if needed, and the powders continued\r\nwithout intermission while the urgency of the symptoms continues. When\r\nrelief has been obtained, these are to be discontinued, and a dose of\r\nsenna tea given to act on the bowels.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiarrhoea.\r\n\r\n2574. The diarrhoea with which children are so frequently affected,\r\nespecially in infancy, should demand the nurse's immediate attention,\r\nand when the secretion, from its clayey colour, indicates an absence of\r\nbile, a powder composed of 3 grains of grey powder and 1 grain of\r\nrhubarb, should be given twice, with an interval of four hours between\r\neach dose, to a child from one to two years, and, a day or two\r\nafterwards, an aperient powder containing the same ingredients and\r\nquantities, with the addition of 2 or 3 grains of scammony. For the\r\nrelaxation consequent on an overloaded stomach, or acidity in the\r\nbowels, a little magnesia dissolved in milk should be employed two or\r\nthree times a day.\r\n\r\n2575. When much griping and pain attend the diarrhoea, half a\r\nteaspoonful of Dalby's Carminative (the best of all patent medicines)\r\nshould be given, either with or without a small quantity of castor oil\r\nto carry off the exciting cause.\r\n\r\n2576. For any form of diarrhoea that, by excessive action, demands a\r\nspeedy correction, the most efficacious remedy that can be employed in\r\nall ages and conditions of childhood is the tincture of Kino, of which\r\nfrom 10 to 30 drops, mixed with a little sugar and water in a spoon, are\r\nto be given every two or three hours till the undue action has been\r\nchecked. Often the change of diet to rice, milk, eggs, or the\r\nsubstitution of animal for vegetable food, or _vice versa_, will correct\r\nan unpleasant and almost chronic state of diarrhoea.\r\n\r\n2577. A very excellent carminative powder for flatulent infants may be\r\nkept in the house, and employed with advantage, whenever the child is in\r\npain or griped, by dropping 5 grains of oil of aniseed and 2 of\r\npeppermint on half an ounce of lump sugar, and rubbing it in a mortar,\r\nwith a drachm of magnesia, into a fine powder. A small quantity of this\r\nmay be given in a little water at any time, and always with benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOCTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n2578. \"Time,\" according to the old proverb, \"is money;\" and it may also,\r\nin many cases, and with equal truthfulness, be said to be life; for a\r\nfew moments, in great emergencies, often turn the balance between\r\nrecovery and death. This applies more especially to all kinds of\r\npoisoning, fits, submersion in water, or exposure to noxious gases; and\r\nmany accidents. If people knew how to act during the interval that must\r\nnecessarily elapse from the moment that a medical man is sent for until\r\nhe arrives, many lives might be saved, which now, unhappily, are lost.\r\nGenerally speaking, however, nothing is done--all is confusion and\r\nfright; and the surgeon, on his arrival, finds that death has already\r\nseized its victim, who, had his friends but known a few rough rules for\r\ntheir guidance, might have been rescued. We shall, therefore, in a\r\nseries of papers, give such information as to the means to be employed\r\nin event of accidents, injuries, &c., as, by the aid of a gentleman of\r\nlarge professional experience, we are warranted in recommending.\r\n\r\nList of Drugs, &c., necessary to carry out all Instructions.\r\n\r\n2579. We append at once A LIST OF DRUGS, &c., and a few PRESCRIPTIONS\r\nnecessary to carry out all the instructions given in this series of\r\narticles. It will be seen that they are few--they are not expensive; and\r\nby laying in a little stock of them, our instructions will be of instant\r\nvalue in all cases of accident, &c.--The drugs are--Antimonial Wine.\r\nAntimonial Powder. Blister Compound. Blue Pill. Calomel. Carbonate of\r\nPotash. Compound Iron Pills. Compound Extract of Colocynth. Compound\r\nTincture of Camphor. Epsom Salts. Goulard's Extract. Jalap in Powder.\r\nLinseed Oil. Myrrh and Aloes Pills. Nitre. Oil of Turpentine. Opium,\r\npowdered, and Laudanum. Sal Ammoniac. Senna Leaves. Soap Liniment,\r\nOpodeldoc. Sweet Spirits of Nitre. Turner's Cerate.--To which should be\r\nadded: Common Adhesive Plaster. Isinglass Plaster. Lint. A pair of small\r\nScales with Weights. An ounce and a drachm Measure-glass. A Lancet. A\r\nProbe. A pair of Forceps, and some curved Needles.\r\n\r\n2580. The following PRESCRIPTIONS may be made up for a few shillings;\r\nand, by keeping them properly labelled, and by referring to the remarks\r\non the treatment of any particular case, much suffering, and, perhaps,\r\nsome lives, may be saved.\r\n\r\n2581. _Draught_.--Twenty grains of sulphate of zinc in an ounce and a\r\nhalf of water. This draught is to be repeated in a quarter of an hour if\r\nvomiting does not take place.\r\n\r\n2582. _Clyster_.--Two tablespoonfuls of oil of turpentine in a pint of\r\nwarm gruel.\r\n\r\n2583. _Liniments_.--1. Equal parts of lime-water and linseed-oil well\r\nmixed together. [Lime-water is made thus: Pour 6 pints of boiling water\r\nupon 1/4 lb. of lime; mix well together, and when cool, strain the\r\nliquid from off the lime which has fallen to the bottom, taking care to\r\nget it as clear as possible.] 2. Compound camphor liniment.\r\n\r\n2584. _Lotions_.--1. Mix a dessert-spoonful of Goulard's extract and 2\r\ntablespoonfuls of vinegar in a pint of water.--2. Mix 1/2 oz. of\r\nsal-ammoniac, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and the same quantity of gin\r\nor whisky, in half a pint of water.\r\n\r\n2585. _Goulard Lotion_.--1 drachm of sugar of lead, 2 pints of\r\nrain-water, 2 teaspoonfuls of spirits of wine. For inflammation of the\r\neyes or elsewhere:--The better way of making Goulard Lotion, if for the\r\neyes, is to add to 6 oz. of distilled water, or water that has been well\r\nboiled, 1 drachm of the extract of lead.\r\n\r\n2586. _Opodeldoc_.--This lotion being a valuable application for\r\nsprains, lumbago, weakness of joints, &c., and it being difficult to\r\nprocure either pure or freshly made, we give a recipe for its\r\npreparation. Dissolve 1 oz. of camphor in a pint of rectified spirits of\r\nwine; then dissolve 4 oz. of hard white Spanish soap, scraped thin, in 4\r\noz. of oil of rosemary, and mix them together.\r\n\r\n2587. _The Common Black Draught_.--Infusion of senna 10 drachms; Epsom\r\nsalts 10 drachms; tincture of senna, compound tincture of cardamums,\r\ncompound spirit of lavender, of each 1 drachm. Families who make black\r\ndraught in quantity, and wish to preserve it for some time without\r\nspoiling, should add about 2 drachms of spirits of hartshorn to each\r\npint of the strained mixture, the use of this drug being to prevent its\r\nbecoming mouldy or decomposed. A simpler and equally efficacious form of\r\nblack draught is made by infusing 1/2 oz. of Alexandrian senna, 3 oz. of\r\nEpsom salts, and 2 drachms of bruised ginger and coriander-seeds, for\r\nseveral hours in a pint of boiling water, straining the liquor, and\r\nadding either 2 drachms of sal-volatile or spirits of hartshorn to the\r\nwhole, and giving 3 tablespoonfuls for a dose to an adult.\r\n\r\n2588. _Mixtures_--1. _Aperient_.--Dissolve an ounce of Epsom salts in\r\nhalf a pint of senna tea: take a quarter of the mixture as a dose, and\r\nrepeat it in three or four hours if necessary.\r\n\r\n2589. 2. _Fever Mixture_.--Mix a drachm of powdered nitre, 2 drachms of\r\ncarbonate of potash, 2 teaspoonfuls of antimonial wine, and a\r\ntablespoonful of sweet spirits of nitre, in half a pint of water.\r\n\r\n2590. 3. _Myrrh and Aloes Pills_.--Ten grains made into two pills are\r\nthe dose for a full-grown person.\r\n\r\n2591. 4. _Compound Iron Pills_.--Dose for a full-grown person: 10 grains\r\nmade into two pills.\r\n\r\n2592. _Pills_.--1. Mix 5 grains of calomel and the same quantity of\r\nantimonial powder with a little bread-crumb, and make into two pills.\r\nDose for a full-grown person: two pills.--2. Mix 5 grains of blue pill\r\nand the same quantity of compound extract of colocynth together, and\r\nmake into two pills, the dose for a full-grown person.\r\n\r\n2593. _Powders_.--Mix a grain of calomel and 4 grains of powdered jalap\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n2594. In all cases, the dose of medicines given is to be regulated by\r\nthe age of the patient.\r\n\r\n2595. _Abernethy's Plan for making a Bread-and-Water Poultice_.--First\r\nscald out a basin; then having put in some boiling water, throw in\r\ncoarsely-crumbled bread, and cover it with a plate. When the bread has\r\nsoaked up as much water as it will imbibe, drain off the remaining\r\nwater, and there will be left a light pulp. Spread it a third of an inch\r\nthick on folded linen, and apply it when of the temperature of a warm\r\nbath. To preserve it moist, occasionally drop warm water on it.\r\n\r\n2596. _Linseed-Meal Poultice_.--\"Scald your basin, by pouring a little\r\nhot water into it; then put a small quantity of finely-ground\r\nlinseed-meal into the basin, pour a little hot water on it, and stir it\r\nround briskly until you have well incorporated them; add a little more\r\nmeal and a little more water; then stir it again. Do not let any lumps\r\nremain in the basin, but stir the poultice well, and do not be sparing\r\nof your trouble. What you do next, is to take as much of it out of the\r\nbasin as you may require, lay it on a piece of soft linen, and let it be\r\nabout a quarter of an inch thick.\"--_Abernethy_.\r\n\r\n2597. _Mustard Poultice_.--Mix equal parts of dry mustard and\r\nlinseed-meal in warm vinegar. When the poultice is wanted weak, warm\r\nwater may be used for the vinegar; and when it is required very strong,\r\nmustard alone, without any linseed-meal, is to be mixed with warm\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\n2598. _An ordinary Blister_.--Spread a little blister compound on a\r\npiece of common adhesive plaster with the right thumb. It should be put\r\non just thickly enough to conceal the appearance of the plaster beneath.\r\nThe part from which a blister has been taken should be covered till it\r\nheals over with soft linen rags smeared with lard.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaths and Fomentations.\r\n\r\n2599. All fluid applications to the body are exhibited either in a hot\r\nor cold form; and the object for which they are administered is to\r\nproduce a stimulating effect over the entire, or a part, of the system;\r\nfor the effect, though differently obtained, and varying in degree, is\r\nthe same in principle, whether procured by hot or cold water.\r\n\r\n2600. _Heat_.--There are three forms in which heat is universally\r\napplied to the body,--that of the tepid, warm, and vapour bath; but as\r\nthe first is too inert to be worth notice, and the last dangerous and\r\ninapplicable, except in public institutions, we shall confine our\r\nremarks to the really efficacious and always attainable one--the\r\n\r\n2601. _Warm and Hot Bath_.--These baths are used whenever there is\r\ncongestion, or accumulation of blood in the internal organs, causing\r\npain, difficulty of breathing, or stupor, and are employed, by their\r\nstimulating property, to cause a rush of blood to the surface, and, by\r\nunloading the great organs, produce a temporary inflammation in the\r\nskin, and so equalize the circulation. The effect of the hot bath is to\r\nincrease the fulness of the pulse, accelerate respiration, and excite\r\nperspiration. In all inflammations of the stomach and bowels, the hot\r\nbath is of the utmost consequence; the temperature of the warm bath\r\nvaries from 92° to 100°, and may be obtained by those who have no\r\nthermometer to test the exact heat, by mixing one measure of boiling\r\nwith two of cold water.\r\n\r\n2602. _Fomentations_ are generally used to effect, in a part, the\r\nbenefit produced on the whole body by the bath; to which a sedative\r\naction is occasionally given by the use of roots, herbs, or other\r\ningredients; the object being to relieve the internal organ, as the\r\nthroat, or muscles round a joint, by exciting a greater flow of blood to\r\nthe skin _over_ the affected part. As the real agent of relief is heat,\r\nthe fomentation should always be as hot as it can comfortably be borne,\r\nand, to insure effect, should be repeated every half-hour. Warm fluids\r\nare applied in order to render the swelling which accompanies\r\ninflammation less painful, by the greater readiness with which the skin\r\nyields, than when it is harsh and dry. They are of various kinds; but\r\nthe most simple, and oftentimes the most useful, that can be employed,\r\nis \"Warm Water.\" Another kind of fomentation is composed of dried\r\npoppyheads, 4 oz. Break them to pieces, empty out the seeds, put them\r\ninto 4 pints of water, boil for a quarter of an hour, then strain\r\nthrough a cloth or sieve, and keep the water for use. Or, chamomile\r\nflowers, hemlock, and many other plants, may be boiled, and the part\r\nfomented with the hot liquor, by means of flannels wetted with the\r\ndecoction.\r\n\r\n2603. _Cold_, when applied in excess to the body, drives the blood from\r\nthe surface to the centre, reduces the pulse, makes the breathing hard\r\nand difficult, produces coma, and, if long continued, death. But when\r\nmedicinally used, it excites a reaction on the surface equivalent to a\r\nstimulating effect; as in some cases of fever, when the body has been\r\nsponged with cold water, it excites, by reaction, increased circulation\r\non the skin. Cold is sometimes used to keep up a repellent action, as,\r\nwhen local inflammation takes place, a remedy is applied, which, by its\r\nbenumbing and astringent effect, causes the blood, or the excess of it\r\nin the part, to recede, and, by contracting the vessels, prevents the\r\nreturn of any undue quantity, till the affected part recovers its tone.\r\nSuch remedies are called _Lotions_, and should, when used, be applied\r\nwith the same persistency as the fomentation; for, as the latter should\r\nbe renewed as often as the heat passes off, so the former should be\r\napplied as often as the heat from the skin deprives the application of\r\nits cold.\r\n\r\n2604. _Poultices_ are only another form of fomentation, though chiefly\r\nused for abscesses. The ingredient best suited for a poultice is that\r\nwhich retains heat the longest; of these ingredients, the best are\r\nlinseed--meal, bran, and bread. Bran sewed into a bag, as it can be\r\nreheated, will be found the cleanest and most useful; especially for\r\nsore throats.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Bleed.\r\n\r\n2605. In cases of great emergency, such as the strong kind of apoplexy,\r\nand when a surgeon cannot possibly be obtained for some considerable\r\ntime, the life of the patient depends almost entirely upon the fact of\r\nhis being bled or not. We therefore give instructions how the operation\r\nof bleeding is to be performed, but caution the reader only to attempt\r\nit in cases of the greatest emergency. Place a handkerchief or piece of\r\ntape rather but not too tightly round the arm, about three or four\r\ninches above the elbow. This will cause the veins below to swell and\r\nbecome very evident. If this is not sufficient, the hand should be\r\nconstantly and quickly opened and shut for the same purpose. There will\r\nnow be seen, passing up the middle of the fore-arm, a vein which, just\r\nbelow the bend of the elbow, sends a branch inwards and outwards, each\r\nbranch shortly joining another large vein. It is from the _outer_\r\nbranch--that the person is to be bled. The right arm is the one mostly\r\noperated on. The operator should take the lancet in his right hand,\r\nbetween the thumb and first finger, place the thumb of his left hand on\r\nthe vein below the part where he is going to bleed from, and then gently\r\nthrust the tip of the lancet into the vein, and, taking care not to push\r\nit too deeply, cut in a gently curved direction, thus and bring it\r\nout, point upwards, at about half an inch from the part of the vein into\r\nwhich he had thrust it. The vein must be cut lengthways, and not across.\r\nWhen sufficient blood has been taken away, remove the bandage from above\r\nthe elbow, and place the thumb of the left hand firmly over the cut,\r\nuntil all the bleeding ceases. A small pad of lint is then to be put\r\nover the cut, with a larger pad over it, and the two kept in their\r\nplaces by means of a handkerchief or linen roller bound pretty tightly\r\nover them and round the arm.\r\n\r\n2606. When a person is bled, he should always be in the standing, or at\r\nany rate in the sitting, position; for if, as is often the case, he\r\nshould happen to faint, he can, in, most eases at least, easily be\r\nbrought to again by the operator placing him flat on his back, and\r\nstopping the bleeding. _This is of the greatest importance._ It has been\r\nrecommended, for what supposed advantages we don't know, to bleed people\r\nwhen they are lying down. Should a person, under these circumstances,\r\nfaint, what could be done to bring him to again? The great treatment of\r\nlowering the body of the patient to the flat position cannot be followed\r\nhere. It is in that position already, and cannot be placed lower than it\r\nat present is--except, as is most likely to be the case, under the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n2607. BLEEDING FROM THE NOSE.--Many children, especially those of a\r\nsanguineous temperament, are subject to sudden discharges of blood from\r\nsome part of the body; and as all such fluxes are in general the result\r\nof an effort of nature to relieve the system from some overload or\r\npressure, such discharges, unless in excess, and when likely to produce\r\ndebility, should not be rashly or too abruptly checked. In general,\r\nthese discharges are confined to the summer or spring months of the\r\nyear, and follow pains in the head, a sense of drowsiness, languor, or\r\noppression; and, as such symptoms are relieved by the loss of blood, the\r\nhemorrhage should, to a certain extent, be encouraged. When, however,\r\nthe bleeding is excessive, or returns too frequently, it becomes\r\nnecessary to apply means to subdue or mitigate the amount. For this\r\npurpose the sudden and unexpected application of cold is itself\r\nsufficient, in most cases, to arrest the most active hemorrhage. A wet\r\ntowel laid suddenly on the back, between the shoulders, and placing the\r\nchild in a recumbent posture, is often sufficient to effect the object;\r\nwhere, however, the effusion resists such simple means, napkins wrung\r\nout of cold water must be laid across the forehead and nose, the hands\r\ndipped in cold water, and a bottle of hot water applied to the feet. If,\r\nin spite of these means, the bleeding continues, a little fine wool or a\r\nfew folds of lint, tied together by a piece of thread, must be pushed up\r\nthe nostril from which the blood flows, to act as a plug and pressure on\r\nthe bleeding vessel. When the discharge has entirely ceased, the plug is\r\nto be pulled out by means of the thread. To prevent a repetition of the\r\nhemorrhage, the body should be sponged every morning with cold water,\r\nand the child put under a course of steel wine, have open-air exercise,\r\nand, if possible, salt-water bathing. For children, a key suddenly\r\ndropped down the back between the skin and clothes, will often\r\nimmediately arrest a copious bleeding.\r\n\r\n2608. SPITTING OF BLOOD, or hemorrhage from the lungs, is generally\r\nknown from blood from the stomach by its being of a brighter colour, and\r\nin less quantities than that, which is always grumous and mixed with the\r\nhalf-digested food. In either case, rest should be immediately enjoined,\r\ntotal abstinence from stimulants, and a low, poor diet, accompanied with\r\nthe horizontal position, and bottles of boiling water to the feet. At\r\nthe same time the patient should suck through a quill, every hour, half\r\na wine-glass of water in which 10 or 15 drops of the elixir of vitriol\r\nhas been mixed, and, till further advice has been procured, keep a towel\r\nwrung out of cold water on the chest or stomach, according to the seat\r\nof the hemorrhage.\r\n\r\n\r\nBites and Stings.\r\n\r\n2609. BITES AND STINGS may be divided into three kinds:--1. Those of\r\nInsects. 2. Those of Snakes. 3. Those of Dogs and other Animals.\r\n\r\n2610. 1. _The Bites or Stings of Insects_, such as gnats, bees, wasps,\r\n&c., need cause very little alarm, and are, generally speaking, easily\r\ncured. They are very serious, however, when they take place on some\r\ndelicate part of the body, such as near the eye, or in the throat. _The\r\ntreatment_ is very simple in most cases; and consists in taking out the\r\nsting, if it is left behind, with a needle, and applying to the part a\r\nliniment made of finely-scraped chalk and olive-oil, mixed together to\r\nabout the thickness of cream.\r\n\r\n2611. Bathing the part bitten with warm turpentine or warm vinegar is\r\nalso of great use. If the person feels faint, he should lie quietly on\r\nhis back, and take a little brandy-and-water, or sal-volatile and water.\r\nWhen the inside of the throat is the part stung, there is great danger\r\nof violent inflammation taking place. In this case, from eight to twelve\r\nleeches should be immediately put to the outside of the throat, and when\r\nthey drop off, the part to which they had been applied should be well\r\nfomented with warm water. The inside of the throat is to be constantly\r\ngargled with salt and water. Bits of ice are to be sucked. Rubbing the\r\nface and hands well over with plain olive-oil, before going to bed, will\r\noften keep gnats and musquitoes from biting during the night. Strong\r\nscent, such as eau-de-Cologne, will have the same effect.\r\n\r\n2612. 2. _Bites of Snakes_.--These are much more dangerous than the\r\npreceding, and require more powerful remedies. The bites of the\r\ndifferent kinds of snakes do not all act alike, but affect people in\r\ndifferent ways.--_Treatment of the part bitten_. The great thing is to\r\nprevent the poison getting into the blood; and, if possible, to remove\r\nthe whole of it at once from the body. A pocket-handkerchief, a piece of\r\ntape or cord, or, in fact, of anything that is at hand, should be tied\r\ntightly round the part of the body bitten; if it be the leg or arm,\r\nimmediately _above_ the bite, and between it and the heart. The bite\r\nshould then be sucked several times by any one who is near. There is no\r\ndanger in this, provided the person who does it has not got the skin\r\ntaken off any part of his mouth. What has been sucked into the mouth\r\nshould be immediately spit out again. But if those who are near have\r\nsufficient nerve for the operation, and a suitable instrument, they\r\nshould cut out the central part bitten, and then bathe the wound for\r\nsome time with warm water, to make it bleed freely. The wound should\r\nafterwards be rubbed with a stick of lunar caustic, or, what is better,\r\na solution of this--60 grains of lunar caustic dissolved in an ounce of\r\nwater--should be dropped into it. The band should be kept on the part\r\nduring the whole of the time that these means are being adopted. The\r\nwound should afterwards be covered with lint dipped in cold water. The\r\nbest plan, however, to be adopted, if it can be managed, is the\r\nfollowing:--take a common wine-glass, and, holding it upside down, put a\r\nlighted candle or a spirit-lamp into it for a minute or two. This will\r\ntake out the air. Then clap the glass suddenly over the bitten part, and\r\nit will become attached, and hold on to the flesh. The glass being\r\nnearly empty, the blood containing the poison will, in consequence, flow\r\ninto it from the wound of its own accord. This process should be\r\nrepeated three or four times, and the wound sucked, or washed with warm\r\nwater, before each application of the glass. As a matter of course, when\r\nthe glass is removed, all the blood should be washed out of it before it\r\nis applied again.--_Constitutional Treatment_. There is mostly at first\r\ngreat depression of strength in these cases, and it is therefore\r\nrequisite to give some stimulant; a glass of hot brandy-and-water, or\r\ntwenty drops of sal-volatile, is the best that can be given. When the\r\nstrength has returned, and if the patient has not already been sick, a\r\nlittle mustard in hot water should be given, to make him so. If, on the\r\nother hand, as is often the case, the vomiting is excessive, a large\r\nmustard poultice should be placed over the stomach, and a grain of solid\r\nopium swallowed in the form of a pill, for the purpose of stopping it.\r\nOnly one of these pills should be given by a non-professional person. In\r\nall cases of bites from snakes, send for a surgeon as quickly as\r\npossible, and act according to the above directions until he arrives. If\r\nhe is within any reasonable distance, content yourself by putting on the\r\nband, sucking the wound, applying the glass, and, if necessary, giving a\r\nlittle brandy-and-water.\r\n\r\n2613. 3. _Bites of Dogs_.--For obvious reasons, these kinds of bites are\r\nmore frequently met with than those of snakes. _The treatment_ is the\r\nsame as that for snake-bites, more especially that of the bitten part.\r\nThe majority of writers on the subject are in favour of keeping the\r\nwound open as long as possible. This may be done by putting a few beans\r\non it, and then by applying a large linseed-meal poultice over them.\r\n\r\n\r\nInjuries and Accidents to Bones.\r\n\r\n2614. _Dislocation of Bones_.--When the end of a bone is pushed out of\r\nits natural position, it is said to be dislocated. This may be caused by\r\nviolence, disease, or natural weakness of the parts about a\r\njoint.--_Symptoms_. Deformity about the joint, with unnatural prominence\r\nat one part, and depression at another. The limb may be shorter or\r\nlonger than usual, and is stiff and unable to be moved, differing in\r\nthese last two respects from a broken limb, which is mostly shorter,\r\nnever longer, than usual, and which is always more movable.--_Treatment_.\r\nSo much practical science and tact are requisite in order to bring a\r\ndislocated bone into its proper position again, that we strongly advise\r\nthe reader never to interfere in these cases; unless, indeed, it is\r\naltogether impossible to obtain the services of a surgeon. But because\r\nany one of us may very possibly be placed in that emergency, we give a\r\nfew rough rules for the reader's guidance. In the first place make the\r\njoint, from which the bone has been displaced, perfectly steady, either\r\nby fixing it to some firm object or else by holding it with the hands;\r\nthen pull the dislocated bone in a direction towards the place from\r\nwhich it has been thrust, so that, if it moves at all from its unnatural\r\nposition, it may have the best chance of returning to its proper place.\r\nDo not, however, pull or press against the parts too violently, as you\r\nmay, perhaps, by doing so, rupture blood-vessels, and produce most\r\nserious consequences. When you _do_ attempt to reduce a dislocated bone,\r\ndo it as quickly as possible after the accident has taken place, every\r\nhour making the operation more difficult. When the patient is very\r\nstrong, he may be put into a warm bath until he feels faint, or have\r\nsixty drops of antimonial wine given him every ten minutes until he\r\nfeels sickish. These two means are of great use in relaxing the muscles.\r\nIf the bone has been brought back again to its proper place, keep it\r\nthere by means of bandages; and if there is much pain about the joint,\r\napply a cold lotion to it, and keep it perfectly at rest. The lotion\r\nshould be, a dessert-spoonful of Goulard's extract, and two tablespoonfuls\r\nof vinegar, mixed in a pint of water. Leeches are sometimes necessary.\r\nUnless the local pain, or general feverish symptoms, are great, the\r\npatient's diet should be the same as usual. Dislocations may be reduced\r\na week, or even a fortnight, after they have taken place. As, therefore,\r\nalthough the sooner a bone is reduced the better, there is no very great\r\nemergency, and as the most serious consequences may follow improper or\r\ntoo violent treatment, it is always better for people in these cases to\r\ndo too little than too much; inasmuch as the good which has not yet may\r\nstill be done, whereas the evil that _has_ been done cannot so easily be\r\nundone.\r\n\r\n2615. FRACTURES OF BONES.--_Symptoms_. 1. Deformity of the part. 2.\r\nUnnatural looseness. 3. A grating sound when the two ends of the broken\r\nbone are rubbed together. 4. Loss of natural motion and power. In some\r\ncases there is also shortening of the limb.--Fracture takes place from\r\nseveral causes, as a fall, a blow, a squeeze, and sometimes from the\r\nviolent action of muscles.--_Treatment_. In cases where a surgeon cannot\r\nbe procured immediately after the accident, the following general rules\r\nare offered for the reader's guidance:--The broken limb should be placed\r\nand kept as nearly as possible in its natural position. This is to be\r\ndone by first pulling the two portions of the bone in opposite\r\ndirections, until the limb becomes as long as the opposite one, and then\r\nby applying a splint, and binding it to the part by means of a roller.\r\nWhen there is no deformity, the pulling is of course unnecessary. If\r\nthere is much swelling about the broken part, a cold lotion is to be\r\napplied. This lotion (_which we will call Lotion No. 1_) may be thus\r\nmade:--Mix a dessert-spoonful of Goulard's extract and two\r\ntablespoonfuls of vinegar in a pint of water. When the leg or arm is\r\nbroken, always, if possible, get it to the same length and form as the\r\nopposite limb. The broken part should be kept perfectly quiet. When a\r\nbroken limb is deformed, and a particular muscle is on the stretch,\r\nplace the limb in such a position as will relax it. This will in most\r\ncases cure the deformity. Brandy-and-water, or sal-volatile and water,\r\nare to be given when the patient is faint. Surgical aid should, of\r\ncourse, be procured as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n2616. JOINTS, INJURIES TO.--All kinds of injuries to joints, of whatever\r\ndescription, require particular attention, in consequence of the violent\r\ninflammations which are so liable to take place in these parts of the\r\nbody, and which do so much mischief in a little time. The joint injured\r\nshould always be kept perfectly at rest; and when it is very painful,\r\nand the skin about it red, swollen, hot, and shining, at the same time\r\nthat the patient has general feverish symptoms, such as great thirst and\r\nheadache--leeches, and when they drop off, warm poppy fomentations, are\r\nto be applied; the No. 1 pills above-mentioned are to be given (two are\r\na dose for a grown person) with a black draught three hours afterwards.\r\nGive also two tablespoonfuls of the fever-mixture every four hours, and\r\nkeep the patient on low diet. When the injury and swelling are not very\r\ngreat, warm applications, with rest, low diet, and a dose of aperient\r\nmedicine, will be sufficient. When a joint has received a penetrating\r\nwound, it will require the most powerful treatment, and can only be\r\nproperly attended to by a surgeon. The patient's friends will have to\r\nuse their own judgment to a great extent in these and in many other\r\ncases, as to when leeches, fever-mixture, &c., are necessary. A\r\nuniversal rule, however, without a single exception, _is always to rest\r\na joint well_ after it has been injured in any way whatever, to purge\r\nthe patient, and to keep him on low diet, without beer, unless he has\r\nbeen a very great drinker indeed, in which case he may still be allowed\r\nto take a little; for if the stimulant that a person has been accustomed\r\nto in excess be all taken away at once, he is very likely to have an\r\nattack of delirium tremens. The quantity given should not, however, be\r\nmuch--say a pint, or, at the most, a pint and a half a day. Rubbing the\r\njoint with opodeldoc, or the application of a blister to it, is of great\r\nservice in taking away the thickenings, which often remain after all\r\nheat, pain, and redness have left an injured joint. Great care should be\r\nobserved in not using a joint too quickly after it has been injured.\r\nWhen the shoulder-joint is the one injured, the arm should be bound\r\ntightly to the body by means of a linen or flannel roller, and the elbow\r\nraised; when the elbow, it should be kept raised in the straight\r\nposition, on a pillow; when the wrist, it should be raised on the chest,\r\nand suspended in a sling; when the knee, it should be kept in the\r\nstraight position; and, lastly, when the ankle, it should be a little\r\nraised on a pillow.\r\n\r\n2617. BRUISES, LACERATIONS, AND CUTS.--Wherever the bruise may be, or\r\nhowever swollen or discoloured the skin may become, two or three\r\napplications of the _extract of lead_, kept to the part by means of\r\nlint, will, in an hour or little more, remove all pain, swelling, and\r\ntenderness. Simple or clean cuts only require the edges of the wound to\r\nbe placed in their exact situation, drawn close together, and secured\r\nthere by one or two slips of adhesive plaster. When the wound, however,\r\nis jagged, or the flesh or cuticle lacerated, the parts are to be laid\r\nas smooth and regular as possible, and a piece of lint, wetted in the\r\n_extract of lead_, laid upon the wound, and a piece of greased lint\r\nplaced above it to prevent the dressing sticking; the whole covered over\r\nto protect from injury, and the part dressed in the same manner once a\r\nday till the cure is effected.\r\n\r\n2618. BRUISES AND THEIR TREATMENT.--The best application for a bruise,\r\nbe it large or small, is moist warmth; therefore, a warm bread-and-water\r\npoultice in hot moist flannels should be put on, as they supple the\r\nskin. If the bruise be very severe, and in the neighbourhood of a joint,\r\nit will be well to apply ten or a dozen leeches over the whole bruised\r\npart, and afterwards a poultice. But leeches should not be put on young\r\nchildren. If the bruised part be the knee or the ankle, walking should\r\nnot be attempted till it can be performed without pain. Inattention to\r\nthis point often lays the foundation for serious mischief in these\r\njoints, especially in the case of scrofulous persons. In all conditions\r\nof bruises occurring in children, whether swellings or abrasions, no\r\nremedy is so quick or certain of effecting a cure as the pure extract of\r\nlead applied to the part.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurns and Scalds.\r\n\r\n2619. BURNS AND SCALDS being essentially the same in all particulars,\r\nand differing only in the manner of their production, may be spoken of\r\ntogether. As a general rule, scalds are less severe than burns, because\r\nthe heat of water, by which scalds are mostly produced, is not, even\r\nwhen it is boiling, so intense as that of flame; oil, however, and other\r\nliquids, whose boiling-point is high, produce scalds of a very severe\r\nnature. Burns and scalds have been divided into three classes. The first\r\nclass comprises those where the burn is altogether superficial, and\r\nmerely reddens the skin; the second, where the injury is greater, and we\r\nget little bladders containing a fluid (called serum) dotted over the\r\naffected part; in the third class we get, in the case of burns, a\r\ncharring, and in that of scalds, a softening or pulpiness, perhaps a\r\ncomplete and immediate separation of the part. This may occur at once,\r\nor in the course of a little time. The pain from the second kind of\r\nburns is much more severe than that in the other two, although the\r\ndanger, as a general rule, is less than it is in the third class. These\r\ninjuries are much more dangerous when they take place on the trunk than\r\nwhen they happen on the arms or legs. The danger arises more from the\r\nextent of surface that is burnt than from the depth to which the burn\r\ngoes. This rule, of course, has certain exceptions; because a small burn\r\non the chest or belly penetrating deeply is more dangerous than a more\r\nextensive but superficial one on the arm or leg. When a person's clothes\r\nare in flames, the best way of extinguishing them is to wind a rug, or\r\nsome thick material, tightly round the whole of the body.\r\n\r\n2620. _Treatment of the First Class of Burns and Scalds_.--_Of the part\r\naffected_.--Cover it immediately with a good coating of common flour, or\r\ncotton-wool with flour dredged well into it. The great thing is to keep\r\nthe affected surface of the skin from the contact of the air. The part\r\nwill shortly get well, and the skin may or may not peel\r\noff.--_Constitutional Treatment_. If the burn or scald is not extensive,\r\nand there is no prostration of strength, this is very simple, and\r\nconsists in simply giving a little aperient medicine--pills (No. 2), as\r\nfollows:--Mix 5 grains of blue pill and the same quantity of compound\r\nextract of colocynth, and make into two pills--the dose for a full-grown\r\nperson. Three hours after the pills give a black draught. If there are\r\ngeneral symptoms of fever, such as hot skin, thirst, headache, &c. &c.,\r\ntwo tablespoonfuls of fever-mixture are to be given every four hours.\r\nThe fever-mixture, we remind our readers, is made thus:-Mix a drachm of\r\npowdered nitro, 2 drachms of carbonate of potash, 2 teaspoonfuls of\r\nantimonial wine, and a tablespoonful of sweet spirits of nitro, in half\r\na pint of water.\r\n\r\n2621. _Second Class. Local Treatment_.--As the symptoms of these kinds\r\nof burns are more severe than those of the first class, so the remedies\r\nappropriate to them are more powerful. Having, as carefully as possible,\r\nremoved the clothes from the burnt surface, and taking care not to break\r\nthe bladders, spread the following liniment (No. 1) on a piece of linen\r\nor lint--not the _fluffy_ side--and apply it to the part: the liniment\r\nshould be equal parts of lime-water and linseed-oil, well mixed. If the\r\nburn is on the trunk of the body, it is better to use a warm\r\nlinseed-meal poultice. After a few days dress the wound with Turner's\r\ncerate. If the burn is at the bend of the elbow, place the arm in the\r\n_straight_ position; for if it is _bent_, the skin, when healed, will be\r\ncontracted, and the arm, in all probability, always remain in the same\r\nun natural position. This, indeed, applies to all parts of the body;\r\ntherefore, always place the part affected in the most _stretched_\r\nposition possible.--_Constitutional Treatment_. The same kind of\r\ntreatment is to be used as for the first class, only it must be more\r\npowerful. Stimulants are move often necessary, but must be given with\r\ngreat caution. If, as is often the case, there is great irritability and\r\nrestlessness, a dose of opium (paregoric, in doses of from sixty to a\r\nhundred drops, according to age, is best) is of great service. The\r\nfeverish symptoms will require aperient medicines and the fever mixture.\r\nA drink made of about a tablespoonful of cream of tartar and a little\r\nlemon-juice, in a quart of warm water, allowed to cool, is a very nice\r\none in these cases. The diet throughout should not be too low,\r\nespecially if there is much discharge from the wound. After a few days\r\nit is often necessary to give wine, ammonia, and strong beef-tea. These\r\nshould be had recourse to when the tongue gets dry and dark, and the\r\npulse weak and frequent. If there should be, after the lapse of a week\r\nor two, pain over one particular part of the belly, a blister should be\r\nput on it, and a powder of mercury and chalk-grey powder, and Dover's\r\npowder (two grains of the former and five of the latter) given three\r\ntimes a day. Affections of the head and chest also frequently occur as a\r\nconsequence of these kinds of burns, but no one who is not a medical man\r\ncan treat them.\r\n\r\n2622. _Third Class_.--These are so severe as to make it impossible for a\r\nnon-professional person to be of much service in attending to them. When\r\nthey occur, a surgeon should always be sent for. Until he arrives,\r\nhowever, the following treatment should be adopted:--Place the patient\r\nfull-length on his back, and keep him warm. Apply fomentations of\r\nflannels wrung out of boiling water and sprinkled with spirits of\r\nturpentine to the part, and give wine and sal-volatile in such\r\nquantities as the prostration of strength requires; always bearing in\r\nmind the great fact that you have to steer between two quicksands--death\r\nfrom present prostration and death from future excitement, which will\r\nalways be increased in proportion to the amount of stimulants given.\r\nGive, therefore, only just as much as is absolutely necessary to keep\r\nlife in the body.\r\n\r\n2623. CONCUSSION OF BRAIN--STUNNING.--This may be caused by a blow or a\r\nfall.--_Symptoms_. Cold skin; weak pulse; almost total insensibility;\r\nslow, weak breathing; pupil of eye sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller,\r\nthan natural; inability to move; unwillingness to answer when spoken to.\r\nThese symptoms come on directly after the accident.--_Treatment_. Place\r\nthe patient quietly on a warm bed, send for a surgeon, _and do nothing\r\nelse for the first four or six hours_. After this time the skin will\r\nbecome hot, the pulse full, and the patient feverish altogether. If the\r\nsurgeon has not arrived by the time these symptoms have set in, shave\r\nthe patient's head, and apply the following lotion (No. 2): Mix half an\r\nounce of sal-ammoniac, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and the same\r\nquantity of gin or whisky, in half a pint of water. Then give this pill\r\n(No. 1); Mix five grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial\r\npowder with a little bread-crumb, and make into two pills. Give a black\r\ndraught three hours after the pill, and two tablespoonfuls of the\r\nabove-mentioned fever-mixture every four hours. Keep on low diet.\r\nLeeches are sometimes to be applied to the head. These cases are often\r\nfollowed by violent inflammation of the brain. They can, therefore, only\r\nbe attended to properly throughout by a surgeon. The great thing for\r\npeople to do in these cases is--nothing; contenting themselves with\r\nputting the patient to bed, and waiting the arrival of a surgeon.\r\n\r\n2624. THE CHOLERA AND AUTUMNAL COMPLAINTS.--To oppose cholera, there\r\nseems no surer or better means than cleanliness, sobriety, and judicious\r\nventilation. Where there is dirt, that is the place for cholera; where\r\nwindows and doors are kept most jealously shut, there cholera will find\r\neasiest entrance; and people who indulge in intemperate diet during the\r\nhot days of autumn are actually courting death. To repeat it,\r\ncleanliness, sobriety, and free ventilation almost always defy the\r\npestilence; but, in case of attack, immediate recourse should be had to\r\na physician. The faculty say that a large number of lives have been\r\nlost, in many seasons, solely from delay in seeking medical assistance.\r\nThey even assert that, taken early, the cholera is by no means a fatal\r\ndisorder. The copious use of salt is recommended on very excellent\r\nauthority. Other autumnal complaints there are, of which diarrhoea is\r\nthe worst example. They come on with pain, flatulence, sickness, with or\r\nwithout vomiting, followed by loss of appetite, general lassitude, and\r\nweakness. If attended to at the first appearance, they may soon be\r\nconquered; for which purpose it is necessary to assist nature in\r\nthrowing off the contents of the bowels, which may be one by means of\r\nthe following prescription:--Take of calomel 3 grains, rhubarb 8 grains;\r\nmix and take it in a little honey or jelly, and repeat the dose three\r\ntimes, at the intervals of four or five hours. The next purpose to be\r\nanswered is the defence of the lining membrane of the intestines from\r\ntheir acrid contents, which will be best effected by drinking copiously\r\nof linseed tea, or of a drink made by pouring boiling water on\r\nquince-seeds, which are of a very mucilaginous nature; or, what is still\r\nbetter, full draughts of whey. If the complaint continue after these\r\nmeans have been employed, some astringent or binding medicine will be\r\nrequired, as the subjoined:--Take of prepared chalk 2 drachms,\r\ncinnamon-water 7 oz., syrup of poppies 1 oz.; mix, and take 3\r\ntablespoonfuls every four hours. Should this fail to complete the cure,\r\n1/2 oz. of tincture of catechu, or of kino, may be added to it, and then\r\nit will seldom fail; or a teaspoonful of the tincture of kino alone,\r\nwith a little water, every three hours, till the diarrhoea is checked.\r\nWhile any symptoms of derangement are present, particular attention must\r\nbe paid to the diet, which should be of a soothing, lubricating, and\r\nlight nature, as instanced in veal or chicken broth, which should\r\ncontain but little salt. Rice, batter, and bread puddings will be\r\ngenerally relished, and be eaten with advantage; but the stomach is too\r\nmuch impaired to digest food of a more solid nature. Indeed, we should\r\ngive that organ, together with the bowels, as little trouble as\r\npossible, while they are so incapable of acting in their accustomed\r\nmanner. Much mischief is frequently produced by the absurd practice of\r\ntaking tincture of rhubarb, which is almost certain of aggravating that\r\nspecies of disorder of which we have now treated; for it is a spirit as\r\nstrong as brandy, and cannot fail of producing harm upon a surface which\r\nis rendered tender by the formation and contact of vitiated bile. But\r\nour last advice is, upon the first appearance of such symptoms as are\r\nabove detailed, have _immediate_ recourse to a doctor, where possible.\r\n\r\n2625. TO CURE A COLD.--Put a large teacupful of linseed, with 1/4 lb. of\r\nsun raisins and 2 oz. of stick liquorice, into 2 quarts of soft water,\r\nand let it simmer over a slow fire till reduced to one quart; add to it\r\n1/4 lb. of pounded sugar-candy, a tablespoonful of old rum, and a\r\ntablespoonful of the best white-wine vinegar, or lemon-juice. The rum\r\nand vinegar should be added as the decoction is taken; for, if they are\r\nput in at first, the whole soon becomes flat and less efficacious. The\r\ndose is half a pint, made warm, on going to bed; and a little may be\r\ntaken whenever the cough is troublesome. The worst cold is generally\r\ncured by this remedy in two or three days; and, if taken in time, is\r\nconsidered infallible.\r\n\r\n2626. COLD ON THE CHEST.--A flannel dipped in boiling water, and\r\nsprinkled with turpentine, laid on the chest as quickly as possible,\r\nwill relieve the most severe cold or hoarseness.\r\n\r\n2627. SUBSTANCES IN THE EYE.--To remove fine particles of gravel, lime,\r\n&c., the eye should be syringed with lukewarm water till free from them.\r\nBe particular not to worry the eye, under the impression that the\r\nsubstance is still there, which the enlargement of some of the minute\r\nvessels makes the patient believe is actually the case.\r\n\r\n2628. SORE EYES.--Incorporate thoroughly, in a glass mortar or vessel,\r\none part of strong citron ointment with three parts of spermaceti\r\nointment. Use the mixture night and morning, by placing a piece of the\r\nsize of a pea in the corner of the eye affected, only to be used in\r\ncases of chronic or long-standing inflammation of the organ, or its\r\nlids.\r\n\r\n2629. LIME IN THE EYE.--Bathe the eye with a little weak\r\nvinegar-and-water, and carefully remove any little piece of lime which\r\nmay be seen, with a feather. If any lime has got entangled in the\r\neyelashes, carefully clear it away with a bit of soft linen soaked in\r\nvinegar-and-water. Violent inflammation is sure to follow; a smart purge\r\nmust be therefore administered, and in all probability a blister must be\r\napplied on the temple, behind the ear, or nape of the neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n2630. STYE IN THE EYE.--Styes are little abscesses which form between\r\nthe roots of the eyelashes, and are rarely larger than a small pea. The\r\nbest way to manage them is to bathe them frequently with warm water, or\r\nin warm poppy-water, if very painful. When they have burst, use an\r\nointment composed of one part of citron ointment and four of spermaceti,\r\nwell rubbed together, and smear along the edge of the eyelid. Give a\r\ngrain or two of calomel with 5 or 8 grains of rhubarb, according to the\r\nage of the child, twice a week. The old-fashioned and apparently absurd\r\npractice of rubbing the stye with a ring, is as good and speedy a cure\r\nas that by any process of medicinal application; though the number of\r\ntimes it is rubbed, or the quality of the ring and direction of the\r\nstrokes, has nothing to do with its success. The pressure and the\r\nfriction excite the vessels of the part, and cause an absorption of the\r\neffused matter under the eyelash. The edge of the nail will answer as\r\nwell as a ring.\r\n\r\n2631. INFLAMMATION OF THE EYELIDS.--The following ointment has been\r\nfound very beneficial in inflammations of the eyeball and edges of the\r\neyelids:--Take of prepared calomel, 1 scruple; spermaceti ointment, 1/2\r\noz. Mix them well together in a glass mortar; apply a small quantity to\r\neach corner of the eye every night and morning, and also to the edges of\r\nthe lids, if they are affected. If this should not eventually remove the\r\ninflammation, elder-flower water may be applied three or four times a\r\nday, by means of an eye-cup. The bowels should be kept in a laxative\r\nstate, by taking occasionally a quarter of an ounce of the Cheltenham or\r\nEpsom salts.\r\n\r\n2632. FASTING.--It is said by many able physicians that fasting is a\r\nmeans of removing incipient disease, and of restoring the body to its\r\ncustomary healthy sensations. Howard, the celebrated philanthropist\r\n(says a writer), used to fast one day in every week. Napoleon, when he\r\nfelt his system unstrung, suspended his wonted repast, and took his\r\nexercise on horseback.\r\n\r\n\r\nFits.\r\n\r\n2633. Fits come on so suddenly, often without even the slightest\r\nwarning, and may prove fatal so quickly, that all people should be\r\nacquainted at least with their leading symptoms and treatment, as a few\r\nmoments, more or less, will often decide the question between life and\r\ndeath. The treatment, in very many cases at least, to be of the\r\nslightest use, should be _immediate_, as a person in a fit (of apoplexy\r\nfor instance) may die while a surgeon is being fetched from only the\r\nnext street. We shall give, as far as the fact of our editing a work for\r\nnon-professional readers will permit, the peculiar and distinctive\r\nsymptoms of all kind of fits, and the immediate treatment to be adopted\r\nin each case.\r\n\r\n2634. APOPLEXY.--These fits may be divided into two kinds--the _strong_\r\nand the _weak_.\r\n\r\n2635. 1. _The strong kind_.--These cases mostly occur in stout, strong,\r\nshort-necked, bloated-faced people, who are in the habit of living\r\nwell.--_Symptoms_. The patient may or may not have had headache, sparks\r\nbefore his eyes, with confusion of ideas and giddiness, for a day or two\r\nbefore the attack. When it takes place, he falls down insensible; the\r\nbody becomes paralyzed, generally more so on one side than the other;\r\nthe face and head are hot, and the blood-vessels about them swollen; the\r\npupils of the eyes are larger than natural, and the eyes themselves are\r\nfixed; the mouth is mostly drawn down at one corner; the breathing is\r\nlike loud snoring; the pulse full and hard.--_Treatment_. Place the\r\npatient immediately in bed, with his head well raised; take off\r\neverything that he has round his neck, and bleed freely and at once from\r\nthe arm. If you have not got a lancet, use a penknife or anything\r\nsuitable that may be at hand. Apply warm mustard poultices to the soles\r\nof the feet and the insides of the thighs and legs; put two drops of\r\ncastor oil, mixed up with eight grains of calomel, on the top of the\r\ntongue, as far back as possible; a most important part of the treatment\r\nbeing to open the bowels as quickly and freely as possible. The patient\r\ncannot swallow; but these medicines, especially the oil, will be\r\nabsorbed into the stomach altogether independent of any voluntary\r\naction. If possible, throw up a warm turpentine clyster (two\r\ntablespoonfuls of oil of turpentine in a pint of warm gruel), or, if\r\nthis cannot be obtained, one composed of about a quart of warm\r\nsalt-and-water and soap. Cut off the hair, and apply rags dipped in weak\r\nvinegar-and-water, or weak gin-and-water, or even simple cold water, to\r\nthe head. If the blood-vessels about the head and neck are much swollen,\r\nput from eight to ten leeches on the temple opposite to the paralyzed\r\nside of the body. Always send for a surgeon immediately, and act\r\naccording to the above rules, doing more or less, according to the means\r\nat hand, and the length of time that must necessarily elapse until he\r\narrives. A pint, or even a quart of blood in a very strong person, may\r\nbe taken away. When the patient is able to swallow, give him the No. 1\r\npills, and the No. 1 mixture directly. [The No. 1 pills are made as\r\nfollows:--Mix 5 grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial\r\npowder with a little bread-crumb: make into two pills, the dose for a\r\nfull-grown person. For the No. 1 mixture, dissolve on ounce of Epsom\r\nsalts in half a pint of senna tea: take a quarter of the mixture as a\r\ndose] Repeat these remedies if the bowels are not well opened. Keep the\r\npatient's head well raised, and cool as above. Give very low diet\r\nindeed: gruel, arrowroot, and the like. When a person is recovering, he\r\nshould have blisters applied to the nape of the neck, his bowels should\r\nbe kept well open, light diet given, and fatigue, worry, and excess of\r\nall kinds avoided.\r\n\r\n2636. 2. _The weak kind_.--_Symptoms_. These attacks are more frequently\r\npreceded by warning symptoms than the first kind. The face is pale, the\r\npulse weak, and the body, especially the hands and legs, cold. After a\r\nlittle while, these symptoms sometimes alter to those of the first class\r\nin a mild degree.--_Treatment._ At first, if the pulse is _very feeble\r\nindeed_, a little brandy-and-water or sal-volatile must be given.\r\nMustard poultices are to be put, as before, to the soles of the foot and\r\nthe insides of the thighs and legs. Warm bricks, or bottles filled with\r\nwarm water, are also to be placed under the armpits. When the strength\r\nhas returned, the body become warmer, and the pulse fuller and harder,\r\nthe head should be shaved, and wet rags applied to it, as before\r\ndescribed. Leeches should be put, as before, to the temple opposite the\r\nside paralyzed; and the bowels should be opened as freely and as quickly\r\nas possible. Bleeding from the arm is often necessary in these cases,\r\nbut a non-professional person should never have recourse to it. Blisters\r\nmay be applied to the nape of the neck at once. The diet in those cases\r\nshould not be so low as in the former--indeed, it is often necessary, in\r\na day or so after one of these attacks, to give wine, strong beef-tea,\r\n&c., according to the condition of the patient's strength.\r\n\r\n2637. _Distinctions between Apoplexy and Epilepsy_.--1. Apoplexy mostly\r\nhappens in people over _thirty_, whereas epilepsy generally occurs under\r\nthat ago; at any rate for the first time. A person who has epileptic\r\nfits over thirty, has generally suffered from them for some years. 2.\r\nAgain, _in apoplexy_, the body is paralyzed; and, therefore, has not\r\n_the convulsions which take place in epilepsy_. 3. The peculiar\r\n_snoring_ will also distinguish apoplexy from epilepsy.\r\n\r\n2638. _Distinctions between Apoplexy and Drunkeness_.--1. The known\r\nhabits of the person. 2. The fact of a person who was perfectly sober\r\nand sensible a little time before, being found in a state of\r\ninsensibility. 3. The absence, in apoplexy, of the _smell of drink_ on\r\napplying the nose to the mouth. 4. A person in a fit of apoplexy cannot\r\nbe roused at all; in drunkenness he mostly can, to a certain extent.\r\n\r\n2639. _Distinction between Apoplexy and Hysteria_.--Hysterics mostly\r\nhappen in young, nervous, unmarried women; and are attended with\r\nconvulsions, sobbing, laughter, throwing about of the body, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n2640. _Distinction between Apoplexy and Poisoning by Opium_.--It is\r\nexceedingly difficult to distinguish between these two cases. In\r\npoisoning by opium, however, we find the particular smell of the drug in\r\nthe patient's breath. We should also, in forming our opinion, take into\r\nconsideration the person's previous conduct--whether he has been low and\r\ndesponding for some time before, or has ever talked about committing\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n2641. EPILEPSY.--_Falling Sickness_.--Those fits mostly happen, at any\r\nrate for the first time, to young people, and are more common in boys\r\nthan girls. They are produced by numerous causes.--_Symptoms_. The fit\r\nmay be preceded by pains in the head, palpitations, &c. &c.; but it\r\nmostly happens that the person falls down insensible suddenly, and\r\nwithout any warning whatever. The eyes are distorted, so that only their\r\nwhites can be seen; there is mostly foaming from the mouth; the fingers\r\nare clinched; and the body, especially on one side, is much agitated;\r\nthe tongue is often thrust out of the mouth. When the fit goes off, the\r\npatient feels drowsy and faint, and often sleeps soundly for some\r\ntime.--_Treatment_. During the fit, keep the patient flat on his back,\r\nwith his head slightly raised, and prevent him from doing any harm to\r\nhimself; dash cold water into his face, and apply smelling-salts to his\r\nnose; loosen his shirt collar, &c.; hold a piece of wood about as thick\r\nas a finger--the handle of a tooth-brush or knife will do as\r\nwell--between the two rows of teeth, at the back part of the mouth. This\r\nwill prevent the tongue from being injured. A teaspoonful of common salt\r\nthrust into the patient's mouth, during the fit, is of much service. The\r\nafter-treatment of these fits is various, and depends entirely upon\r\ntheir causes. A good general rule, however, is always to keep the bowels\r\nwell open, and the patient quiet, and free from fatigue, worry, and\r\nexcess of all kinds.\r\n\r\n2642. _Fainting Fits_ are sometimes very dangerous, and at others\r\nperfectly harmless; the question of danger depending altogether upon the\r\ncauses which have produced them, and which are exceedingly various. For\r\ninstance, fainting produced by disease of the heart is a very serious\r\nsymptom indeed; whereas, that arising from some slight cause, such as\r\nthe sight of blood, &c., need cause no alarm whatever. The symptoms of\r\nsimple fainting are so well known that it would be quite superfluous to\r\nenumerate them here. The _treatment_ consists in laying the patient at\r\nfull length upon his back, with his head upon a level with the rest of\r\nhis body, loosening everything about the neck, dashing cold water into\r\nthe face, and sprinkling vinegar and water about the mouth; applying\r\nsmelling-salts to the nose; and, when the patient is able to swallow, in\r\ngiving a little warm brandy-and-water, or about 20 drops of sal-volatile\r\nin water.\r\n\r\n2643. _Hysterics_.--These fits take place, for the most part, in young,\r\nnervous, unmarried women. They happen much less often in married women;\r\nand even (in some rare cases indeed) in men. Young women, who are\r\nsubject to these fits, are apt to think that they are suffering from\r\n\"all the ills that flesh is heir to;\" and the false symptoms of disease\r\nwhich they show are so like the true ones, that it is often exceedingly\r\ndifficult to detect the difference. The fits themselves are mostly\r\npreceded by great depression of spirits, shedding of tears, sickness,\r\npalpitation of the heart, &c. A pain, as if a nail were being driven in,\r\nis also often felt at one particular part of the head. In almost all\r\ncases, when a fit is coming on, pain is felt on the left side. This pain\r\nrises gradually until it reaches the throat, and then gives the patient\r\na sensation as if she had a pellet there, which prevents her from\r\nbreathing properly, and, in fact, seems to threaten actual suffocation.\r\nThe patient now generally becomes insensible, and faints; the body is\r\nthrown about in all directions, froth issues from the mouth, incoherent\r\nexpressions are uttered, and fits of laughter, crying, or screaming,\r\ntake place. When the fit is going off, the patient mostly cries\r\nbitterly, sometimes knowing all, and at others nothing, of what has\r\ntaken place, and feeling general soreness all over the body. _Treatment\r\nduring the fit_. Place the body in the same position as for simple\r\nfainting, and treat, in other respects, as directed in the article on\r\nEpilepsy. _Always well loosen the patient's stays_; and, when she is\r\nrecovering, and able to swallow, give 20 drops of sal volatile in a\r\nlittle water. The _after-treatment_ of these cases is very various. If\r\nthe patient is of a strong constitution, she should live on plain diet,\r\ntake plenty of exercise, and take occasional doses of castor oil, or an\r\naperient mixture, such as that described as \"No. 1,\" in previous\r\nnumbers. If, as is mostly the case, the patient is weak and delicate,\r\nshe will require a different mode of treatment altogether. Good\r\nnourishing diet, gentle exercise, cold baths, occasionally a dose of No.\r\n3 myrrh and aloes pills at night, and a dose of compound iron pills\r\ntwice a day. [As to the myrrh and aloes pills (No. 3), 10 grains made\r\ninto two pills are a dose for a full-grown person. Of the compound iron\r\npills (No. 4), the dose for a full grown person is also 10 grains, made\r\ninto two pills.] In every case, amusing the mind, and avoiding all\r\ncauses of over-excitement, are of great service in bringing about a\r\npermanent cure.\r\n\r\n2644. LIVER COMPLAINT AND SPASMS.--A very obliging correspondent\r\nrecommends the following, from personal experience:--Take 4 oz. of dried\r\ndandelion root, 1 oz. of the best ginger, 1/4 oz. of Columba root;\r\nbraise and boil all together in 3 pints of water till it is reduced to a\r\nquart: strain, and take a wine-glassful every four hours. Our\r\ncorrespondent says it is a \"safe and simple medicine for both liver\r\ncomplaint and spasms.\"\r\n\r\n2645. LUMBAGO.--A \"new and successful mode\" of treating lumbago,\r\nadvocated by Dr. Day, is a form of counter-irritation, said to have been\r\nintroduced into this country by the late Sir Anthony Carlisle, and which\r\nconsists in the instantaneous application of a flat iron button, gently\r\nheated in a spirit-lamp, to the skin. Dr. Corrigan published, about\r\nthree years ago, an account of some cases very successfully treated by\r\nnearly similar means. Dr. Corrigan's plan was, however, to touch the\r\nsurface of the part affected, at intervals of half an inch, as lightly\r\nand rapidly as possible. Dr. Day has found greater advantages to result\r\nfrom drawing the flat surface of the heated button lightly over the\r\naffected part, so as to act on a greater extent of surface. The doctor\r\nspeaks so enthusiastically of the benefit to be derived from this\r\npractice, that it is evidently highly deserving attention.\r\n\r\n2646. PALPITATION OF THE HEART.--Where palpitation occurs as symptomatic\r\nof indigestion, the treatment must be directed to remedy that disorder;\r\nwhen it is consequent on a plethoric state, purgatives will be\r\neffectual. In this case the patient should abstain from every kind of\r\ndiet likely to produce a plethoric condition of body. Animal food and\r\nfermented liquor must be particularly avoided. Too much indulgence in\r\nsleep will also prove injurious. When the attacks arise from nervous\r\nirritability, the excitement must be allayed by change of air and a\r\ntonic diet. Should the palpitation originate from organic derangement,\r\nit must be, of course, beyond domestic management. Luxurious living,\r\nindolence, and tight-lacing often produce this affection: such cases are\r\nto be conquered with a little resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n2647.

The symptoms of poisoning may be known for the most part from\r\nthose of some diseases, which they are very like, from the fact of their\r\ncoming on _immediately_ after eating or drinking something; whereas\r\nthose of disease come on, in most cases at least, by degrees, and with\r\nwarnings. In most cases where poison is known, or suspected, to have\r\nbeen taken, the first thing to be done is to empty the stomach, well and\r\nimmediately, by means of mustard mixed in warm water, or plain warm\r\nsalt-and-water, or, better, this draught, which we call No. 1:--Twenty\r\ngrains of sulphate of zinc in an ounce and a half of water. This draught\r\nto be repeated in a quarter of an hour if vomiting does not ensue. The\r\nback part of the throat should be well tickled with a feather, or two of\r\nthe fingers thrust down it, to induce vomiting. The cases where vomiting\r\nmust not be used are those where the skin has been taken off, and the\r\nparts touched irritated and inflamed by the poison taken, and where the\r\naction of vomiting would increase the evil. Full instructions are given\r\nin the article on each particular poison as to where emetics are or are\r\nnot to be given. The best and safest way of emptying the stomach is by\r\nmeans of the stomach-pump, as in certain cases the action of vomiting is\r\nlikely to increase the danger arising from the swollen and congested\r\ncondition of the blood-vessels of the head, which often takes place. In\r\nthe hands, however, of any one else than a surgeon, it would be not only\r\nuseless, but harmful, as a great deal of dexterity, caution, and\r\nexperience are required to use it properly. After having made these\r\nbrief introductory remarks, we shall now proceed to particulars.\r\n\r\n2649. _Sulphuric Acid, or Oil of Vitriol_ (a clear, colourless liquid,\r\nof an oily appearance).--_Symptoms in those who have swallowed it_. When\r\nmuch is taken, these come on immediately. There is great burning pain,\r\nextending from the mouth to the stomach; vomiting of a liquid of a dark\r\ncoffee-colour, often mixed with shreds of flesh and streaks of blood;\r\nthe skin inside the mouth is taken off; and the exposed surface is at\r\nfirst white, and after a time becomes brownish. There are sometimes\r\nspots of a brown colour round the lips and on the neck, caused by drops\r\nof the acid falling on these parts. There is great difficulty of\r\nbreathing, owing to the swelling at the back part of the mouth. After a\r\ntime there is much depression of strength, with a quick, weak pulse, and\r\ncold, clammy skin. The face is pale, and has a very anxious look. When\r\nthe acid swallowed has been greatly diluted in water, the same kind of\r\nsymptoms occur, only in a milder degree.--_Treatment_. Give a mixture of\r\nmagnesia in milk-and-water, or, if this cannot be obtained, of finely\r\npowdered chalk, or whiting, or even of the plaster torn down from the\r\nwalls or ceiling, in milk-and-water. The mixture should be nearly as\r\nthick as cream, and plenty of it given. As well as this, simple gruel,\r\nmilk, or thick flour-and-water, are very useful, and should be given in\r\nlarge quantities. Violent inflammation of the parts touched by the acid\r\nis most likely to take place in the coarse of a little time, and can\r\nonly be properly attended to by a surgeon; but if one cannot be\r\nobtained, leeches, the fever-mixtures (the recipe for which appears\r\nrepeatedly in previous paragraphs), thick drinks, such as barley-water,\r\ngruel, arrowroot, &c., must be had recourse to, according to the\r\nsymptoms of each particular case and the means at hand. The inflamed\r\ncondition of the back part of the mouth requires particular attention.\r\nWhen the breathing is very laboured and difficult in consequence, from\r\nfifteen to twenty leeches are to be immediately applied to the outside\r\nof the throat, and when they drop off, warm poppy fomentations\r\nconstantly kept to the part. When the pain over the stomach is very\r\ngreat, the same local treatment is necessary; but if it is only slight,\r\na good mustard poultice will be sufficient without the leeches. In all\r\nthese cases, two tablespoonfuls of the fever-mixture should be given\r\nevery four hours, and only gruel or arrowroot allowed to be eaten for\r\nsome days.\r\n\r\n2650. _Nitric Acid_, commonly known as _Aqua Fortis_, or _Red Spirit of\r\nNitre_ (a straw-coloured fluid, of the consistence of water, and which\r\ngives off dense white fumes on exposure to the air).--_Symptoms produced\r\nin those who have swallowed it._ Much the same as in the case of\r\nsulphuric acid. In this case, however, the surface touched by the acid\r\nbecomes _yellowish_. The tongue is mostly much swollen.--_Treatment_.\r\nThe same as for sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n2651. _Muriatic Acid, Spirit of Salt_ (a thin yellow fluid, emitting\r\ndense white fumes on exposure to the air).--This is not often taken as a\r\npoison. The _symptoms_ and _treatment_ are much the same as those of\r\n_nitric acid_.\r\n\r\nN.B.--_In no case of poisoning by these three acids should emetics ever\r\nbe given_.\r\n\r\n2652. _Oxalic Acid_, commonly called _Salt of Lemons_.--This poison may\r\nbe taken by mistake for Epsom salts, which it is a good deal like. It\r\nmay be distinguished from them by its very acid taste and its shape,\r\nwhich is that of needle-formed crystals, each of which, if put into a\r\ndrop of ink, will turn it to a reddish brown, whereas Epsom salts will\r\nnot change its colour at all. When a large dose of this poison has been\r\ntaken, death takes place very quickly indeed.--_Symptoms produced in\r\nthose who have swallowed it_. A hot, burning, acid taste is felt in the\r\nact of swallowing, and vomiting of a _greenish-brown_ fluid is produced,\r\nsooner or later, according to the quantity and strength of the poison\r\ntaken. There is great tenderness felt over the stomach, followed by\r\nclammy perspirations and convulsions; the legs are often drawn up, and\r\nthere is generally stupor, from which the patient, however, can easily\r\nbe roused, and always great prostration of strength. The pulse is small\r\nand weak, and the breathing faint.--_Treatment_. Chalk or magnesia, made\r\ninto a cream with water, should be given in large quantities, and\r\nafterwards the emetic draught above prescribed, or some\r\nmustard-and-water, if the draught cannot be got. The back part of the\r\nthroat to be tickled with a feather, to induce vomiting. Arrowroot,\r\ngruel, and the like drinks, are to be taken. When the prostration of\r\nstrength is very great and the body cold, warmth is to be applied to it,\r\nand a little brandy-and-water, or sal-volatile and water, given.\r\n\r\n2653. _Prussic Acid_ (a thin, transparent, and colourless liquid, with a\r\npeculiar smell, which greatly resembles that of bitter almonds).--_Symptoms\r\nproduced in those who have swallowed it_. These come on _immediately_\r\nafter the poison has been taken, and may be produced by merely _smelling_\r\nit. The patient becomes perfectly insensible, and falls down in\r\nconvulsions--his eyes are fixed and staring, the pupils being bigger\r\nthan natural, the skin is cold and clammy, the pulse scarcely perceptible,\r\nand the breathing slow and gasping.--_Treatment_. Very little can be done\r\nin these cases, as death takes place so quickly after the poison has\r\nbeen swallowed, when it takes place at all. The best treatment--which\r\nshould always be adopted in all cases, even though the patient appears\r\nquite dead-is to dash quantities of cold water on the back, from the top\r\nof the neck downwards. Placing the patient under a pump, and pumping on\r\nhim, is the best way of doing this. Smelling-salts are also to be applied\r\nto the nose, and the chest well rubbed with a camphor liniment.\r\n\r\n2654. ALKALIS: _Potash, Soda_, and _Ammonia_, or common\r\n_Smelling-Salts_, with their principal preparations--_Pearlash, Soap\r\nLees, Liquor Potassae, Nitre, Sal Prunella, Hartshorn_, and\r\n_Sal--Volatile._--Alkalis are seldom taken or given with the view of\r\ndestroying life. They may, however, be swallowed by mistake.--_Symptoms\r\nproduced in those who have swallowed them_. There is at first a burning,\r\nacrid taste in, and a sensation of tightness round, the throat, like\r\nthat of strangling; the skin touched is destroyed; retching mostly\r\nfollowed by actual vomiting, then sets in; the vomited matters often\r\ncontaining blood of a dark brown colour, with little shreds of flesh\r\nhere and there, and always changing vegetable blue colours green. There\r\nis now great tenderness over the whole of the belly. After a little\r\nwhile, great weakness, with cold, clammy sweats, a quick weak pulse, and\r\npurging of bloody matters, takes place. The brain, too, mostly becomes\r\naffected.--_Treatment_. Give two tablespoonfuls of vinegar or\r\nlemon-juice in a glassful of water every few minutes until the burning\r\nsensation is relieved. Any kind of oil or milk may also be given, and\r\nwill form soap when mixed with the poison in the stomach. Barley-water,\r\ngruel, arrowroot, linseed-tea, &c., are also very useful, and should be\r\ntaken constantly, and in large quantities. If inflammation should take\r\nplace, it is to be treated by applying leeches and warm poppy\r\nfomentations to the part where the pain is most felt, and giving two\r\ntablespoonfuls of the fever mixture every four hours. The diet in all\r\nthese cases should only consist of arrowroot or gruel for the first few\r\ndays, and then of weak broth or beef-tea for some time after.\r\n\r\n2655. When very strong fumes of smelling-salts have in any way been\r\ninhaled, there is great difficulty of breathing, and alarming pain in\r\nthe mouth and nostrils. In this case let the patient inhale the steam of\r\nwarm vinegar, and treat the feverish symptoms as before.\r\n\r\n2656. _Arsenic_.--Mostly seen under the form of white arsenic, or\r\nfly-powder, and yellow arsenic, or king's yellow.--_Symptoms produced in\r\nthose who have swallowed it_. These vary very much, according to the\r\nform and dose in which the poison has been taken. There is faintness,\r\ndepression, and sickness, with an intense burning pain in the region of\r\nthe stomach, which gets worse and worse, and is increased by pressure.\r\nThere is also vomiting of dark brown matter, sometimes mixed with blood;\r\nand mostly great thirst, with a feeling of tightness round, and of\r\nburning in, the throat. Purging also takes place, the matters brought\r\naway being mixed with blood. The pulse is small and irregular, and the\r\nskin sometimes cold and clammy, and at others hot. The breathing is\r\npainful. Convulsions and spasms often occur.--_Treatment_. Give a couple\r\nof teaspoonfuls of mustard in a glass of water, to bring on or assist\r\nvomiting, and also use the other means elsewhere recommended for the\r\npurpose. A solution, half of lime-water and half of linseed-oil, well\r\nmixed, may be given, as well as plenty of arrowroot, gruel, or\r\nlinseed-tea. Simple milk is also useful. A little castor-oil should be\r\ngiven, to cleanse the intestines of all the poison, and the\r\nafter-symptoms treated on general principles.\r\n\r\n2657. _Corrosive Sublimate_.--Mostly seen in the form of little heavy\r\ncrystalline masses, which melt in water, and have a metallic taste. It\r\nis sometimes seen in powder. This is a most powerful poison.--_Symptoms_.\r\nThese mostly come on immediately after the poison has been taken. There\r\nis a coppery taste experienced in the act of swallowing, with a burning\r\nheat, extending from the top of the throat down to the stomach; and also\r\na feeling of great tightness round the throat. In a few minutes great\r\npain is felt over the region of the stomach, and frequent vomiting of\r\nlong, stringy white masses, mixed with blood, takes place. There is\r\nalso mostly great purging. The countenance is generally pale and\r\nanxious; the pulse always small and frequent; the skin cold and clammy,\r\nand the breathing difficult. Convulsions and insensibility often occur,\r\nand are very bad symptoms indeed. The inside of the mouth is more or\r\nless swollen.--_Treatment_. Mix the whites of a dozen eggs in two pints\r\nof cold water, and give a glassful of the mixture every three or four\r\nminutes, until the stomach can contain no more. If vomiting does not now\r\ncome on naturally, and supposing the mouth is not very sore or much\r\nswollen, an emetic draught, No. 1, may be given, and vomiting induced.\r\n(The No. 1 draught, we remind our readers, is thus made:--Twenty grains\r\nof sulphate of zinc in an ounce and a half of water; the draught to be\r\nrepeated if vomiting does not take place in a quarter of an hour.) After\r\nthe stomach has been well cleaned out, milk, flour-and-water, linseed-tea,\r\nor barley-water, should be taken in large quantities. If eggs cannot be\r\nobtained, milk, or flour-and-water, should be given as a substitute for\r\nthem at once. When the depression of strength is very great indeed, a\r\nlittle warm brandy-and-water must be given. In the course of an hour or\r\ntwo the patient should take two tablespoonfuls of castor-oil, and if\r\ninflammation comes on, it is to be treated as directed in the article on\r\nacids and alkalis. The diet should also be the same. If the patient\r\nrecovers, great soreness of the gums is almost certain to take place. The\r\nsimplest, and at the same time one of the best modes of treatment, is to\r\nwash them well three or four times a day with brandy-and-water.\r\n\r\n2658. _Calomel_.--A heavy white powder, without taste, and insoluble in\r\nwater. It has been occasionally known to destroy life.--_Symptoms_. Much\r\nthe same as in the case of corrosive sublimate.--_Treatment_. The same\r\nas for corrosive sublimate. If the gums are sore, wash them, as\r\nrecommended in the case of corrosive sublimate, with brandy-and-water\r\nthree or four times a day, and keep the patient on _fluids_, such as\r\narrowroot, gruel, broth, or beef-tea, according to the other symptoms.\r\nEating hard substances would make the gums more sore and tender.\r\n\r\n2659. _Copper_.--The preparations of this metal which are most likely to\r\nbe the ones producing poisonous symptoms, are _blue-stone_ and\r\n_verdigris_. People are often taken ill after eating food that has been\r\ncooked in copper saucepans. When anything has been cooked in one of\r\nthese vessels, _it should never be allowed to cool in it_.--_Symptoms_.\r\nHeadache, pain in the stomach, and purging; vomiting of green or blue\r\nmatters, convulsions, and spasms.--_Treatment_. Give whites of eggs,\r\nsugar-and-water, castor-oil, and drinks, such as arrowroot and gruel.\r\n\r\n2660. _Emetic Tartar_.--Seen in the form of a white powder, or crystals,\r\nwith a slightly metallic taste. It has not often been known to destroy\r\nlife.--_Symptoms_. A strong metallic taste in the act of swallowing,\r\nfollowed by a burning pain in the region of the stomach, vomiting, and\r\ngreat purging. The pulse is small and rapid, the skin cold and clammy,\r\nthe breathing difficult and painful, and the limbs often much cramped.\r\nThere is also great prostration of strength.--_Treatment_. Promote the\r\nvomiting by giving plenty of warm water, or warm arrowroot and water.\r\nStrong tea, in large quantities, should be drunk; or, if it can be\r\nobtained, a decoction of oak bark. The after-treatment is the same as\r\nthat for acids and alkalis; the principal object in all these cases\r\nbeing to keep down the inflammation of the parts touched by the poison\r\nby means of leeches, warm poppy fomentations, fever-mixtures, and very\r\nlow diet.\r\n\r\n2661. _Lead_, and its preparations, _Sugar of Lead, Goulard's Extract,\r\nWhite Lead._--Lead is by no means an active poison, although it is\r\npopularly considered to be so. It mostly affects people by being taken\r\ninto the system slowly, as in the case of painters and glaziers. A\r\nnewly-painted house, too, often affects those living in it.--_Symptoms\r\nproduced when taken in a large dose_. There is at first a burning,\r\npricking sensation in the throat, to which thirst, giddiness, and\r\nvomiting follow. The belly is tight, swollen, and painful; _the pain\r\nbeing relieved by pressure_. The bowels are mostly bound. There is great\r\ndepression of strength, and a cold skin.--Treatment. Give an emetic\r\ndraught (No. 1, see above) at once, and shortly afterwards a solution of\r\nEpsom salts in large quantities. A little brandy-and-water must be taken\r\nif the depression of strength is very great indeed. Milk, whites of\r\neggs, and arrowroot are also useful. After two or three hours, cleanse\r\nthe stomach and intestines well out with two tablespoonfuls of\r\ncastor-oil, and treat the symptoms which follow according to the rules\r\nlaid down in other parts of these articles.--_Symptoms when it is taken\r\ninto the body slowly_. Headache, pain about the navel, loss of appetite\r\nand flesh, offensive breath, a blueness of the edges of the gums; the\r\nbelly is tight, hard, and knotty, and the pulse slow and languid. There\r\nis also sometimes a difficulty in swallowing.--_Treatment_. Give five\r\ngrains of calomel and half a grain of opium directly, in the form of a\r\npill, and half an ounce of Epsom salts in two hours, and repeat this\r\ntreatment until the bowels are well opened. Put the patient into a warm\r\nbath, and throw up a clyster of warmish water when he is in it.\r\nFomentations of warm oil of turpentine, if they can be obtained, should\r\nbe put over the whole of the belly. The great object is to open the\r\nbowels as freely and as quickly as possible. When this has been done, a\r\ngrain of pure opium may be given. Arrowroot or gruel should be taken in\r\ngood large quantities. The after-treatment must depend altogether upon\r\nthe symptoms of each particular case.\r\n\r\n2662. _Opium_, and its preparations, _Laudanum, &c_.--Solid opium is\r\nmostly seen in the form of rich brown flattish cakes, with little pieces\r\nof leaves sticking on them here and there, and a bitter and slightly\r\nwarm taste. The most common form in which it is taken as a poison, is\r\nthat of laudanum.--_Symptoms_. These consist at first in giddiness and\r\nstupor, followed by insensibility, the patient, however, being roused to\r\nconsciousness by a great noise, so as to be able to answer a question,\r\nbut becoming insensible again almost immediately. The pulse is now quick\r\nand small, the breathing hurried, and the skin warm and covered with\r\nperspiration. After a little time, these symptoms change; the person\r\nbecomes _perfectly insensible_, the breathing slow and _snoring_, as in\r\napoplexy, the skin cold, and the pulse slow and full. The pupil of the\r\neye is mostly smaller than natural. On applying his nose to the patient's\r\nmouth, a person may smell the poison very distinctly.--_Treatment_.\r\nGive an emetic draught (No. 1, see above) directly, with large quantities\r\nof warm mustard-and-water, warm salt-and-water, or simple warm water.\r\nTickle the top of the throat with a feather, or put two fingers down it\r\nto bring on vomiting, which rarely takes place of itself. Dash cold water\r\non the head, chest, and spine, and flap these parts well with the ends of\r\nwet towels. Give strong coffee or tea. Walk the patient up and down in\r\nthe open air for two or three hours; the great thing being to keep him\r\nfrom sleeping. Electricity is of much service. When the patient is\r\nrecovering, mustard poultices should be applied to the soles of the feet\r\nand the insides of the thighs and legs. The head should be kept cool and\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n2663. The following preparations, which are constantly given to children\r\nby their nurses and mothers, for the purpose of making them sleep, often\r\nprove fatal:--_Syrup of Poppies_, and _Godfrey's Cordial_. The author\r\nwould most earnestly urge all people caring for their children's lives,\r\nnever to allow any of these preparations to be given, unless ordered by\r\na surgeon.\r\n\r\n2664. The treatment in the case of poisoning by _Henbane_, _Hemlock_,\r\n_Nightshade_, and _Foxglove_, is much the same as that for opium.\r\nVomiting should be brought on in all of them.\r\n\r\n2665. _Poisonous Food_.--It sometimes happens that things which are in\r\ndaily use, and mostly perfectly harmless, give rise, under certain\r\nunknown circumstances, and in certain individuals, to the symptoms of\r\npoisoning. The most common articles of food of this description are\r\n_Mussels_, _Salmon_, and certain kinds of _Cheese_ and _Bacon_. The\r\ngeneral symptoms are thirst, weight about the stomach, difficulty of\r\nbreathing, vomiting, purging, spasms, prostration of strength, and, in\r\nthe case of mussels more particularly, an eruption on the body, like\r\nthat of nettle-rash.--_Treatment_. Empty the stomach well with No. 1\r\ndraught and warm water, and give two tablespoonfuls of castor-oil\r\nimmediately after. Let the patient take plenty of arrowroot, gruel, and\r\nthe like drinks, and if there is much depression of strength, give a\r\nlittle warm brandy-and-water. Should symptoms of fever or inflammation\r\nfollow, they must be treated as directed in the articles on other kinds\r\nof poisoning.\r\n\r\n2666. _Mushrooms_, and similar kinds of vegetables, often produce\r\npoisonous effects. The symptoms are various, sometimes giddiness and\r\nstupor, and at others pain in and swelling of the belly, with vomiting\r\nand purging, being the leading ones. When the symptoms come on quickly\r\nafter taking the poison, it is generally the head that is affected.--The\r\ntreatment consists in bringing on vomiting in the usual manner, as\r\nquickly and as freely as possible. The other symptoms are to be treated\r\non general principles; if they are those of depression, by\r\nbrandy-and-water or sal-volatile; if those of inflammation, by leeches,\r\nfomentations, fever-mixtures, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n2667. FOR CURE OF RINGWORM.--Take of subcarbonate of soda 1 drachm,\r\nwhich dissolve in 1/2 pint of vinegar. Wash the head every morning with\r\nsoft soap, and apply the lotion night and morning. One teaspoonful of\r\nsulphur and treacle should also be given occasionally night and morning.\r\nThe hair should be cut close, and round the spot it should be shaved\r\noff, and the part, night and morning, bathed with a lotion made by\r\ndissolving a drachm of white vitriol in 8 oz. of water. A small piece of\r\neither of the two subjoined ointments rubbed into the part when the\r\nlotion has dried in. No, 1.--Take of citron ointment 1 drachm; sulphur\r\nand tar ointment, of each 1/2 oz.: mix thoroughly, and apply twice a\r\nday. No. 2.--Take of simple cerate 1 oz.; creosote 1 drachm; calomel 30\r\ngrains: mix and use in the same manner as the first. Concurrent with\r\nthese external remedies, the child should take an alterative powder\r\nevery morning, or, if they act too much on the bowels, only every second\r\nday. The following will be found to answer all the intentions desired.\r\n\r\n2668. Alterative Powders for Ringworm.--Take of\r\n\r\n  Sulphuret of antimony, precipitated . 24 grains.\r\n  Grey powder    .     .    .    .    . 12 grains.\r\n  Calomel .      .     .    .    .    .  6 grains.\r\n  Jalap powder   .     .    .    .    . 36 grains.\r\n\r\nMix carefully, and divide into 12 powders for a child from 1 to 2 years\r\nold; into 9 powders for a child from 2 to 4 years; and into 6 powders\r\nfor a child from 4 to 6 years. Where the patient is older, the strength\r\nmay be increased by enlarging the quantities of the drugs ordered, or by\r\ngiving one and a half or two powders for one dose. The ointment is to be\r\nwell washed off every morning with soap-and-water, and the part bathed\r\nwith the lotion before re-applying the ointment. An imperative fact must\r\nbe remembered by mother or nurse,--never to use the same comb employed\r\nfor the child with ringworm, for the healthy children, or let the\r\naffected little one sleep with those free from the disease; and, for\r\nfear of any contact by hands or otherwise, to keep the child's head\r\nenveloped in a nightcap, till this eruption is completely cured.\r\n\r\n2669. SCRATCHES.--Trifling as scratches often seem, they ought never to\r\nbe neglected, but should be covered and protected, and kept clean and\r\ndry until they have completely healed. If there is the least appearance\r\nof inflammation, no time should be lost in applying a large\r\nbread-and-water poultice, or hot flannels repeatedly applied, or even\r\nleeches in good numbers may be put on at some distance from each other.\r\n\r\n2670. FOR SHORTNESS OF BREATH, OR DIFFICULT BREATHING.--Vitriolated\r\nspirits of ether 1 oz., camphor 12 grains: make a solution, of which\r\ntake a teaspoonful during the paroxysm. This is found to afford\r\ninstantaneous relief in difficulty of breathing, depending on internal\r\ndiseases and other causes, where the patient, from a very quick and\r\nlaborious breathing, is obliged to be in an erect posture.\r\n\r\n2671. SPRAINS.--A sprain is a stretching of the leaders or ligaments of\r\na part through some violence, such as slipping, falling on the hands,\r\npulling a limb, &c. &c. The most common are those of the ankle and\r\nwrist. These accidents are more serious than people generally suppose,\r\nand often more difficult to cure than a broken log or arm. The first\r\nthing to be done is to place the sprained part in the straight position,\r\nand to raise it a little as well. Some recommend the application of cold\r\nlotions at first. The editress, however, is quite convinced that warm\r\napplications are, in most cases, the best for for the first three or\r\nfour days. These fomentations are to be applied in the following\r\nmanner:--Dip a good-sized piece of flannel into a pail or basin full of\r\nhot water or hot poppy fomentation,--six poppy heads boiled in one quart\r\nof water for about a quarter of an hour; wring it almost dry, and apply\r\nit, as hot as the patient can bear, right round the sprained part. Then\r\nplace another piece of flannel, quite dry, over it, in order that the\r\nsteam and warmth may not escape. This process should be repeated as\r\noften as the patient feels that the flannel next to his skin is getting\r\ncold--the oftener the better. The bowels should be opened with a black\r\ndraught, and the patient kept on low diet. If he has been a great\r\ndrinker, he may be allowed to take a little beer; but it is better not\r\nto do so. A little of the cream of tartar drink, ordered in the case of\r\nburns, may be taken occasionally if there is much thirst. When the\r\nswelling and tenderness about the joint are very great, from eight to\r\ntwelve leeches may be applied. When the knee is the joint affected, the\r\ngreatest pain is felt at the inside, and therefore the greater quantity\r\nof the leeches should be applied to that part. When the shoulder is\r\nsprained, the arm should be kept close to the body by means of a linen\r\nroller, which is to be taken four or five times round the whole of the\r\nchest. It should also be brought two or three times underneath the\r\nelbow, in order to raise the shoulder. This is the best treatment for\r\nthese accidents during the first three or four days. After that time,\r\nsupposing that no unfavourable symptoms have taken place, a cold lotion,\r\ncomposed of a tablespoonful of sal-ammoniac to a quart of water, or\r\nvinegar-and-water, should be constantly applied. This lotion will\r\nstrengthen the part, and also help in taking away any thickening that\r\nmay have formed about the joint. In the course of two or three weeks,\r\naccording to circumstances, the joint is to be rubbed twice a day with\r\nflannel dipped in opodeldoc, a flannel bandage rolled tightly round the\r\njoint, the pressure being greatest at the lowest part, and the patient\r\nallowed to walk about with the assistance of a crutch or stick. He\r\nshould also occasionally, when sitting or lying down, quietly bend the\r\njoint backwards and forwards, to cause its natural motion to return, and\r\nto prevent stiffness from taking place. When the swelling is very great\r\nimmediately after the accident has occurred, from the breaking of the\r\nblood-vessels, it is best to apply cold applications at first. If it can\r\nbe procured, oil-silk may be put over the warm-fomentation flannel,\r\ninstead of the dry piece of flannel. Old flannel is better than new.\r\n\r\n2672. CURE FOR STAMMERING.--Where there is no malformation of the organs\r\nof articulation, stammering may be remedied by reading aloud with the\r\nteeth closed. This should be practised for two hours a day, for three or\r\nfour months. The advocate of this simple remedy says, \"I can speak with\r\ncertainty of its utility.\"\r\n\r\n2673. STAMMERING.--At a recent meeting of the Boston Society of Natural\r\nHistory, Dr. Warren stated, \"A simple, easy, and effectual cure of\r\nstammering.\" It is, simply, at every syllable pronounced, to tap at the\r\nsame time with the finger; by so doing, \"the most inveterate stammerer\r\nwill be surprised to find that he can pronounce quite fluently, and, by\r\nlong and constant practice, he will pronounce perfectly well.\"\r\n\r\n2674. SUFFOCATION, APPARENT.--Suffocation may arise from many different\r\ncauses. Anything which prevents the air getting into the lungs will\r\nproduce it. We shall give the principal causes, and the treatment to be\r\nfollowed in each case.\r\n\r\n2675. 1. _Carbonic Acid Gas. Choke-Damp of Mines_.--This poisonous gas\r\nis met with in rooms where charcoal is burnt, and where there is not\r\nsufficient draught to allow it to escape; in coalpits, near limekilns,\r\nin breweries, and in rooms and houses where a great many people live\r\nhuddled together in wretchedness and filth, and where the air in\r\nconsequence becomes poisoned. This gas gives out no smell, so that we\r\ncannot know of its presence. A candle will not burn in a room which\r\ncontains much of it.--_Effects_. At first there is giddiness, and a\r\ngreat wish to sleep; after a little time, or where there is much of it\r\npresent, a person feels great weight in the head, and stupid; gets by\r\ndegrees quite unable to move, and snores as if in a deep sleep. The\r\nlimbs may or may not be stiff. The heat of the body remains much the\r\nsame at first.--_Treatment_. Remove the person affected into the open\r\nair, and, even though it is cold weather, take off his clothes. Then lay\r\nhim on his back, with his head slightly raised. Having done this, dash\r\nvinegar-and-water over the whole of the body, and rub it hard,\r\nespecially the face and chest, with towels dipped in the same mixture.\r\nThe hands and feet also should be rubbed with a hard brush. Apply\r\nsmelling-salts to the nose, which may be tickled with a feather. Dashing\r\ncold water down the middle of the back is of great service. If the\r\nperson can swallow, give him a little lemon-water, or vinegar-and-water\r\nto drink. The principal means, however, to be employed in this, as, in\r\nfact, in most cases of apparent suffocation, is what is called\r\n_artificial breathing_. This operation should be performed by three\r\npersons, and in the following manner:--The first person should put the\r\nnozzle of a common pair of bellows into one of the patient's nostrils;\r\nthe second should push down, and then thrust back, that part of the\r\nthroat called \"Adam's apple;\" and the third should first raise and then\r\ndepress the chest, one hand being placed over each side of the ribs.\r\nThese three actions should be performed in the following order:--First\r\nof all, the throat should be drawn down and thrust back; then the chest\r\nshould be raised, and the bellows gently blown into the nostril.\r\nDirectly this is done, the chest should be depressed, so as to imitate\r\ncommon breathing. This process should be repeated about eighteen times a\r\nminute. The mouth and the other nostril should be closed while the\r\nbellows are being blown. Persevere, if necessary, with this treatment\r\nfor seven or eight hours--in fact, till absolute signs of death are\r\nvisible. Many lives are lost by giving it up too quickly. When the\r\npatient becomes roused, he is to be put into a warm bed, and a little\r\nbrandy-and-water, or twenty drops of sal-volatile, given cautiously now\r\nand then. This treatment is to be adopted in all cases where people are\r\naffected from breathing bad air, smells, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n2676. 2. _Drowning_.--This is one of the most frequent causes of death\r\nby suffocation.--Treatment. Many methods have been adopted, and as some\r\nof them are not only useless, but hurtful, we will mention them here,\r\nmerely in order that they may be avoided. In the first place, then,\r\nnever hang a person up by his heels, as it is an error to suppose that\r\nwater gets into the lungs. Hanging a person up by his heels would be\r\nquite as bad as hanging him up by his neck. It is also a mistake to\r\nsuppose that rubbing the body with salt and water is of\r\nservice.--_Proper Treatment_. Directly a person has been taken out of\r\nthe water, he should be wiped dry and wrapped in blankets; but if these\r\ncannot be obtained, the clothes of the bystanders must be used for the\r\npurpose. His head being slightly raised, and any water, weeds, or froth\r\nthat may happen to be in his mouth, having been removed, he should be\r\ncarried as quickly as possible to the nearest house. He should now be\r\nput into a warm bath, about as hot as the hand can pleasantly bear, and\r\nkept there for about ten minutes, artificial breathing being had\r\nrecourse to while he is in it. Having been taken out of the bath, he\r\nshould be placed flat on his back, with his head slightly raised, upon a\r\nwarm bed in a warm room, wiped perfectly dry, and then rubbed constantly\r\nall over the body with warm flannels. At the same time, mustard\r\npoultices should be put to the soles of the feet, the palms of the\r\nhands, and the inner surface of the thighs and legs. Warm bricks, or\r\nbottles filled with warm water, should be placed under the armpits. The\r\nnose should be tickled with a feather, and smelling-salts applied to it.\r\nThis treatment should be adopted while the bath is being got ready, as\r\nwell as when the body has been taken out of it. The bath is not\r\nabsolutely necessary; constantly rubbing the body with flannels in a\r\nwarm room having been found sufficient for resuscitation. Sir B. Brodie\r\nsays that warm air is quite as good as warm water. When symptoms of\r\nreturning consciousness begin to show themselves, give a little wine,\r\nbrandy, or twenty drops of sal-volatile and water. In some cases it is\r\nnecessary, in about twelve or twenty-four hours after the patient has\r\nrevived, to bleed him, for peculiar head-symptoms which now and then\r\noccur. Bleeding, however, even in the hands of professional men\r\nthemselves, should be very cautiously used--non-professional ones should\r\nnever think of it. The best thing to do in these cases is to keep the\r\nhead well raised, and cool with a lotion such as that recommended above\r\nfor sprains; to administer an aperient draught, and to abstain from\r\ngiving anything that stimulates, such as wine, brandy, sal-volatile, &c.\r\n&c. As a general rule, a person dies in three minutes and a half after\r\nhe has been under water. It is difficult, however, to tell how long he\r\nhas actually been _under_ it, although we may know well exactly how long\r\nhe has been _in_ it. This being the case, always persevere in your\r\nattempts at resuscitation until actual signs of death have shown\r\nthemselves, even for six, eight, or ten hours. Dr. Douglas, of Glasgow,\r\nresuscitated a person who had been under water for fourteen minutes, by\r\nsimply rubbing the whole of his body with warm flannels, in a warm room,\r\nfor eight hours and a half, at the end of which time the person began to\r\nshow the _first_ symptoms of returning animation. Should the accident\r\noccur at a great distance from any house, this treatment should be\r\nadopted as closely as the circumstances will permit of. Breathing\r\nthrough any tube, such as a piece of card or paper rolled into the form\r\nof a pipe, will do as a substitute for the bellows. To recapitulate: Rub\r\nthe body dry; take matters out of mouth; cover with blankets or clothes;\r\nslightly raise the head, and place the body in a warm bath, or on a bed\r\nin a warm room; apply smelling-salts to nose; employ artificial\r\nbreathing; rub well with warm flannels; put mustard poultices to feet,\r\nhands, and insides of thighs and legs, with warm bricks or bottles to\r\narmpits. _Don't bleed_. Give wine, brandy, or sal-volatile when\r\nrecovering, and _persevere till actual signs of death are seen._\r\n\r\n2677. Briefly to conclude what we have to say of suffocation, let us\r\ntreat of _Lightning_. When a person has been struck by lightning, there\r\nis a general paleness of the whole body, with the exception of the part\r\nstruck, which is often blackened, or even scorched.--_Treatment_. Same\r\nas for drowning. It is not, however, of much use; for when death takes\r\nplace at all, it is generally instantaneous.\r\n\r\n2678. CURE FOR THE TOOTHACHE.--Take a piece of sheet zinc, about the\r\nsize of a sixpence, and a piece of silver, say a shilling; place them\r\ntogether, and hold the defective tooth between them or contiguous to\r\nthem; in a few minutes the pain will be gone, as if by magic. The zinc\r\nand silver, acting as a galvanic battery, will produce on the nerves of\r\nthe tooth sufficient electricity to establish a current, and\r\nconsequently to relieve the pain. Or smoke a pipe of tobacco and\r\ncaraway-seeds. Again--\r\n\r\n2679. A small piece of the pellitory root will, by the flow of saliva it\r\ncauses, afford relief. Creosote, or a few drops of tincture of myrrh, or\r\nfriar's balsam, on cotton, put on the tooth, will often subdue the pain.\r\nA small piece of camphor, however, retained in the mouth, is the most\r\nreliable and likely means of conquering the paroxysms of this dreaded\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n2680. WARTS.--Eisenberg says, in his \"Advice on the Hand,\" that the\r\nhydrochlorate of lime is the most certain means of destroying warts; the\r\nprocess, however, is very slow, and demands perseverance, for, if\r\ndiscontinued before the proper time, no advantage is gained. The\r\nfollowing is a simple cure:--On breaking the stalk of the crowfoot plant\r\nin two, a drop of milky juice will be observed to hang on the upper part\r\nof the stem; if this be allowed to drop on a wart, so that it be well\r\nsaturated with the juice, in about three or four dressings the warts\r\nwill die, and may be taken off with the fingers. They may be removed by\r\nthe above means from the teats of cows, where they are sometimes very\r\ntroublesome, and prevent them standing quiet to be milked. The wart\r\ntouched lightly every second day with lunar caustic, or rubbed every\r\nnight with blue-stone, for a few weeks, will destroy the largest wart,\r\nwherever situated.\r\n\r\n2681. To CURE A WHITLOW.--As soon as the whitlow has risen distinctly, a\r\npretty large piece should be snipped out, so that the watery matter may\r\nreadily escape, and continue to flow out as fast as produced. A\r\nbread-and-water poultice should be put on for a few days, when the wound\r\nshould be bound up lightly with some mild ointment, when a cure will be\r\nspeedily completed. Constant poulticing both before and after the\r\nopening of the whitlow, is the only practice needed; but as the matter\r\nlies deep, when it is necessary to open the abscess, the incision must\r\nbe made _deep_ to reach the suppuration.\r\n\r\n2682. WOUNDS.--There are several kinds of wounds, which are called by\r\ndifferent names, according to their appearance, or the manner in which\r\nthey are produced. As, however, it would be useless, and even hurtful,\r\nto bother the reader's head with too many nice professional\r\ndistinctions, we shall content ourselves with dividing wounds into three\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n2683. 1. _Incised wounds or cuts_--those produced by a knife, or some\r\nsharp instrument.\r\n\r\n2684. 2. _Lacerated, or torn wounds_--those produced by the claws of an\r\nanimal, the bite of a dog, running quickly against some projecting blunt\r\nobject, such as a nail, &c.\r\n\r\n2685. 3. _Punctured or penetrating wounds_--those produced by anything\r\nrunning deeply into the flesh; such as a sword, a sharp nail, a spike,\r\nthe point of a bayonet, &c.\r\n\r\n2686. Class 1. _Incised wounds or cuts_.--The danger arising from these\r\naccidents is owing more to their position than to their extent. Thus, a\r\ncut of half an inch long, which goes through an artery, is more serious\r\nthan a cut of two inches long, which is not near one. Again, a small cut\r\non the head is more often followed by dangerous symptoms than a much\r\nlarger one on the legs.--_Treatment_. If the cut is not a very large\r\none, and no artery or vein is wounded, this is very simple. If there are\r\nany foreign substances left in the wound, they must be taken out, and\r\nthe bleeding must be quite stopped before the wound is strapped up. If\r\nthe bleeding is not very great, it may easily be stopped by raising the\r\ncut part, and applying rags dipped in cold water to it. All clots of\r\nblood must be carefully removed; for, if they are left behind, they\r\nprevent the wound from healing. When the bleeding has been stopped, and\r\nthe wound perfectly cleaned, its two edges are to be brought closely\r\ntogether by thin straps of common adhesive plaster, which should remain\r\non, if there is not great pain or heat about the part, for two or three\r\ndays, without being removed. The cut part should be kept raised and\r\ncool. When the strips of plaster are to be taken off, they should first\r\nbe well bathed with lukewarm water. This will cause them to come away\r\neasily, and without opening the lips of the wound; which accident is\r\nvery likely to take place, if they are pulled off without having been\r\nfirst moistened with the warm water. If the wound is not healed when the\r\nstrips of plaster are taken off, fresh ones must be applied. Great care\r\nis required in treating cuts of the head, as they are often followed by\r\nerysipelas taking place round them. They should be strapped with\r\nisinglass plaster, which is much less irritating than the ordinary\r\nadhesive plaster. Only use as many strips as are actually requisite to\r\nkeep the two edges of the wound together; keep the patient quite quiet,\r\non low diet, for a week or so, according to his symptoms. Purge him well\r\nwith the No. 2 pills (five grains of blue pill mixed with the same\r\nquantity of compound extract of colocynth; make into two pills, the dose\r\nfor an adult). If the patient is feverish, give him two tablespoonfuls\r\nof the fever-mixture three times a day. (The fever-mixture, we remind\r\nour readers, is thus made: Mix a drachm of powdered nitre, 2 drachms of\r\ncarbonate of potash, 2 teaspoonfuls of antimonial wine, and a\r\ntablespoonful of sweet spirits of nitre in half a pint of water.) A\r\nperson should be very careful of himself for a month or two after having\r\nhad a bad cut on the head. His bowels should be kept constantly open,\r\nand all excitement and excess avoided. When a vein or artery is wounded,\r\nthe danger is, of course, much greater. Those accidents, therefore,\r\nshould always be attended to by a surgeon, if he can possibly be\r\nprocured. Before he arrives, however, or in case his assistance cannot\r\nbe obtained at all, the following treatment should be adopted:--Raise\r\nthe cut part, and press rags dipped in cold water firmly against it.\r\nThis will often be sufficient to stop the bleeding, if the divided\r\nartery or vein is not dangerous. When an artery is divided, the blood is\r\nof a bright red colour, and comes away in jets. In this case, and\r\nsupposing the leg or arm to be the cut part, a handkerchief is to be\r\ntied tightly round the limb _above_ the cut; and, if possible, the two\r\nbleeding ends of the artery should each be tied with a piece of silk. If\r\nthe bleeding is from a vein, the blood is much darker, and does not come\r\naway in jets. In this case, the handkerchief is to be tied _below_ the\r\ncut, and a pad of lint or linen pressed firmly against the divided ends\r\nof the vein. Let every bad cut, especially where there is much bleeding,\r\nand even although it may to all appearance have been stopped, be\r\nattended to by a surgeon, if one can by any means be obtained.\r\n\r\n2687. Class 2. _Lacerated or torn wounds_.--There is not so much\r\nbleeding in these cases as in clean cuts, because the blood-vessels are\r\ntorn across in a zigzag manner, and not divided straight across. In\r\nother respects, however, they are more serious than ordinary cuts, being\r\noften followed by inflammation, mortification, fever, and in some cases\r\nby locked-jaw. Foreign substances are also more likely to remain in\r\nthem.--_Treatment_. Stop the bleeding, if there is any, in the manner\r\ndirected for cuts; remove all substances that may be in the wound; keep\r\nthe patient quite quiet, and on low diet--gruel, arrowroot, and the\r\nlike; purge with the No. 1 pills and the No. 1 mixture. (The No. 1 pill:\r\nMix 5 grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder, with\r\na little bread-crumb, and make into two pills, which is the dose for an\r\nadult. The No. 1 mixture: Dissolve an ounce of Epsom salts in half a\r\npint of senna tea. A quarter of the mixture is a dose.) If there are\r\nfeverish symptoms, give two tablespoonfuls of fever-mixture (see above)\r\nevery four hours. If possible, bring the two edges of the wound\r\ntogether, _but do not strain the parts to do this_. If they cannot be\r\nbrought together, on account of a piece of flesh being taken clean out,\r\nor the raggedness of their edges, put lint dipped in cold water over the\r\nwound, and cover it with oiled silk. It will then fill up from the\r\nbottom. If the wound, after being well washed, should still contain any\r\nsand, or grit of any kind, or if it should get red and hot from\r\ninflammation, a large warm bread poultice will be the best thing to\r\napply until it becomes quite clean, or the inflammation goes down. When\r\nthe wound is a very large one, the application of warm poppy\r\nfomentations is better than that of the lint dipped in cold water. If\r\nthe redness and pain about the part, and the general feverish symptoms,\r\nare great, from eight to twelve leeches are to be applied round the\r\nwound, and a warm poppy fomentation or warm bread poultice applied after\r\nthey drop off.\r\n\r\n2688. Class 3. _Punctured or penetrating wounds_.--These, for many\r\nreasons, are the most serious of all kinds of wounds.--_Treatment_. The\r\nsame as that for lacerated wounds. Pus (matter) often forms at the\r\nbottom of these wounds, which should, therefore, be kept open at the\r\ntop, by separating their edges every morning with a bodkin, and applying\r\na warm bread poultice immediately afterwards. They will then, in all\r\nprobability, heal up from the bottom, and any matter which may form will\r\nfind its own way out into the poultice. Sometimes, however, in spite of\r\nall precautions, collections of matter (abscesses) will form at the\r\nbottom or sides of the wound. Those are to be opened with a lancet, and\r\nthe matter thus let out. When matter is forming, the patient has cold\r\nshiverings, throbbing pain in the part, and flushes on the face, which\r\ncome and go. A swelling of the part is also often seen. The matter in\r\nthe abscesses may be felt to move backwards and forwards, when pressure\r\nis made from one side of the swelling to the other with the first and\r\nsecond fingers (the middle and that next the thumb) of each hand.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL MEMORANDA.\r\n\r\n2689. ADVANTAGES OF CLEANLINESS.--Health and strength cannot be long\r\ncontinued unless the skin--_all_ the skin--is washed frequently with a\r\nsponge or other means. Every morning is best; after which the skin\r\nshould be rubbed very well with a rough cloth. This is the most certain\r\nway of preventing cold, and a little substitute for exercise, as it\r\nbrings blood to the surface, and causes it to circulate well through the\r\nfine capillary vessels. Labour produces this circulation naturally. The\r\ninsensible perspiration cannot escape well if the skin is not clean, as\r\nthe pores get choked up. It is said that in health about half the\r\naliment we take passes out through the skin.\r\n\r\n2690. THE TOMATO MEDICINAL.--To many persons there is something\r\nunpleasant, not to say offensive, in the flavour of this excellent\r\nfruit. It has, however, long been used for culinary purposes in various\r\ncountries of Europe. Dr. Bennett, a professor of some celebrity,\r\nconsiders it an invaluable article of diet, and ascribes to it very\r\nimportant medicinal properties. He declares:--1. That the tomato is one\r\nof the most powerful deobstruents of the _materia medica_; and that, in\r\nall those affections of the liver and other organs where calomel is\r\nindicated, it is probably the most effective and least harmful remedial\r\nagent known in the profession. 2. That a chemical extract can be\r\nobtained from it, which will altogether supersede the use of calomel in\r\nthe cure of diseases. 3. That he has successfully treated diarrhoea with\r\nthis article alone. 4. That when used as an article of diet, it is\r\nalmost a sovereign remedy for dyspepsia and indigestion.\r\n\r\n2691. WARM WATER.--Warm water is preferable to cold water, as a drink,\r\nto persons who are subject to dyspeptic and bilious complaints, and it\r\nmay be taken more freely than cold water, and consequently answers\r\nbetter as a diluent for carrying off bile, and removing obstructions in\r\nthe urinary secretion, in cases of stone and gravel. When water of a\r\ntemperature equal to that of the human body is used for drink, it proves\r\nconsiderably stimulant, and is particularly suited to dyspeptic,\r\nbilious, gouty, and chlorotic subjects.\r\n\r\n2692. CAUTIONS IN VISITING SICK-ROOMS.--Never venture into a sick-room\r\nif you are in a violent perspiration (if circumstances require your\r\ncontinuance there), for the moment your body becomes cold, it is in a\r\nstate likely to absorb the infection, and give you the disease. Nor\r\nvisit a sick person (especially if the complaint be of a contagious\r\nnature) with _an empty stomach_; as this disposes the system more\r\nreadily to receive the contagion. In attending a sick person, place\r\nyourself where the air passes from the door or window to the bed of the\r\ndiseased, not betwixt the diseased person and any fire that is in the\r\nroom, as the heat of the fire will draw the infectious vapour in that\r\ndirection, and you would run much danger from breathing it.\r\n\r\n2693. NECESSITY OF GOOD VENTILATION IN ROOMS LIGHTED WITH GAS.--In\r\ndwelling-houses lighted by gas, the frequent renewal of the air is of\r\ngreat importance. A single gas-burner will consume more oxygen, and\r\nproduce more carbonic acid to deteriorate the atmosphere of a room, than\r\nsix or eight candles. If, therefore, when several burners are used, no\r\nprovision is made for the escape of the corrupted air and for the\r\nintroduction of pure air from without, the health will necessarily\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGAL MEMORANDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n2694. Humorists tell us there is no act of our lives which can be\r\nperformed without breaking through some one of the many meshes of the\r\nlaw by which our rights are so carefully guarded; and those learned in\r\nthe law, when they do give advice without the usual fee, and in the\r\nconfidence of friendship, generally say, \"Pay, pay anything rather than\r\ngo to law;\" while those having experience in the courts of Themis have a\r\nwholesome dread of its pitfalls. There are a few exceptions, however, to\r\nthis fear of the law's uncertainties; and we hear of those to whom a\r\nlawsuit is on agreeable relaxation, a gentle excitement. One of this\r\nclass, when remonstrated with, retorted, that while one friend kept\r\ndogs, and another horses, he, as he had a right to do, kept a lawyer;\r\nand no one had a right to dispute his taste. We cannot pretend, in these\r\nfew pages, to lay down even the principles of law, not to speak of its\r\ncontrary exposition in different courts; but there are a few acts of\r\nlegal import which all men--and women too--must perform; and to these\r\nacts we may be useful in giving a right direction. There is a house to\r\nbe leased or purchased, servants to be engaged, a will to be made, or\r\nproperty settled, in all families; and much of the welfare of its\r\nmembers depends on these things being done in proper legal form.\r\n\r\n2695. PURCHASING A HOUSE.--Few men will venture to purchase a freehold,\r\nor even a leasehold property, by private contract, without making\r\nthemselves acquainted with the locality, and employing a solicitor to\r\nexamine the titles,; but many do walk into an auction-room, and bid for\r\na property upon the representations of the auctioneer. The conditions,\r\nwhatever they are, will bind him; for by one of the legal fictions of\r\nwhich we have still so many, the auctioneer, who is in reality the agent\r\nfor the vendor, becomes also the agent for the buyer, and by putting\r\ndown the names of bidders and the biddings, he binds him to whom the lot\r\nis knocked down to the sale and the conditions,--the falling of the\r\nauctioneer's hammer is the acceptance of the offer, which completes the\r\nagreement to purchase. In any such transaction you can only look at the\r\nwritten or printed particulars; any verbal statement of the auctioneer,\r\nmade at the time of the sale, cannot contradict them, and they are\r\nimplemented by the agreement, which the auctioneer calls on the\r\npurchaser to sign after the sale. You should sign no such contract\r\nwithout having a duplicate of it signed by the auctioneer, and delivered\r\nto you. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to add, that no trustee or assignee\r\ncan purchase property for himself included in the trust, even at\r\nauction; nor is it safe to pay the purchase money to an agent of the\r\nvendor, unless he give a written authority to the agent to receive it,\r\nbesides handing over the requisite deeds and receipts.\r\n\r\n2696. The laws of purchase and sale of property are so complicated that\r\nLord St. Leonards devotes five chapters of his book on Property Law to\r\nthe subject. The only circumstances strong enough to vitiate a purchase,\r\nwhich has been reduced to a written contract, is proof of fraudulent\r\nrepresentation as to an encumbrance of which the buyer was ignorant, or\r\na defect in title; but every circumstance which the purchaser might have\r\nlearned by careful investigation, the law presumes that he did know.\r\nThus, in buying a leasehold estate or house, all the covenants of the\r\noriginal lease are presumed to be known. \"It is not unusual,\" says Lord\r\nSt. Leonards, \"to stipulate, in conditions of sale of leasehold\r\nproperty, that the production of a receipt for the last year's rent\r\nshall be accepted as proof that all the lessor's covenants were\r\nperformed up to that period. Never bid for one clogged with such a\r\ncondition. There are some acts against which no relief can be obtained;\r\nfor example, the tenant's right to insure, or his insuring in an office\r\nor in names not authorized in the lease. And you should not rely upon\r\nthe mere fact of the insurance being correct at the time of sale: there\r\nmay have been a prior breach of covenant, and the landlord may not have\r\nwaived his right of entry for the forfeiture.\" And where any doubt of\r\nthis kind exists, the landlord should be appealed to.\r\n\r\n2697. Interest on a purchase is due from the day fixed upon for\r\ncompleting: where it cannot be completed, the loss rests with the party\r\nwith whom the delay rests; but it appears, when the delay rests with the\r\nseller, and the money is lying idle, notice of that is to be given to\r\nthe seller to make him liable to the loss of interest. In law, the\r\nproperty belongs to the purchaser from the date of the contract; he is\r\nentitled to any benefit, and must bear any loss; the seller may suffer\r\nthe insurance to drop without giving notice; and should a fire take\r\nplace, the loss falls on the buyer. In agreeing to buy a house,\r\ntherefore, provide at the same time for its insurance. Common fixtures\r\npass with the house, where nothing is said about them.\r\n\r\n2698. There are some well-recognized laws, of what may be called\r\ngood-neighbourhood, which affect all properties. If you purchase a field\r\nor house, the seller retaining another field between yours and the\r\nhighway, he must of necessity grant you a right of way. Where the owner\r\nof more than one house sells one of them, the purchaser is entitled to\r\nbenefit by all drains leading from his house into other drains, and will\r\nbe subject to all necessary drains for the adjoining houses, although\r\nthere is no express reservation as to drains.\r\n\r\nThus, if his happens to be a leading drain, other necessary drains may\r\nbe opened into it. In purchasing land for building on, you should\r\nexpressly reserve a right to make an opening into any sewer or\r\nwatercourse on the vendor's land for drainage purposes.\r\n\r\n2699. CONSTRUCTIONS.--Among the cautions which purchasers of houses,\r\nland, or leaseholds, should keep in view, is a not inconsiderable array\r\nof _constructive_ notices, which are equally binding with actual ones.\r\nNotice to your attorney or agent is notice to you; and when the same\r\nattorney is employed by both parties, and he is aware of an encumbrance\r\nof which you are ignorant, you are bound by it; even where the vendor is\r\nguilty of a fraud to which your agent is privy, you are responsible, and\r\ncannot be released from the consequences.\r\n\r\n2700. THE RELATIONS OF LANDLORD AND TENANT are most important to both\r\nparties, and each should clearly understand his position. The proprietor\r\nof a house, or house and land, agrees to let it either to a\r\ntenant-at-will, a yearly tenancy, or under lease. A tenancy-at-will may\r\nbe created by parol or by agreement; and as the tenant may be turned out\r\nwhen his landlord pleases, so he may leave when he himself thinks\r\nproper; but this kind of tenancy is extremely inconvenient to both\r\nparties. Where an annual rent is attached to the tenancy, in\r\nconstruction of law, a lease or agreement without limitation to any\r\ncertain period is a lease from year to year, and both landlord and\r\ntenant are entitled to notice before the tenancy can be determined by\r\nthe other. This notice must be given at least six months before the\r\nexpiration of the current year of the tenancy, and it can only terminate\r\nat the end of any whole year from the time at which it began; so that\r\nthe tenant entering into possession at Midsummer, the notice must be\r\ngiven to or by him, so as to terminate at the same term. When once he is\r\nin possession, he has a right to remain for a whole year; and if no\r\nnotice be given at the end of the first half-year of his tenancy, he\r\nwill have to remain two years, and so on for any number of years.\r\n\r\n2701. TENANCY BY SUFFERANCE.--This is a tenancy, not very uncommon,\r\narising out of the unwillingness of either party to take the initiative\r\nin a more decided course at the expiry of a lease or agreement. The\r\ntenant remains in possession, and continues to pay rent as before, and\r\nbecomes, from sufferance, a tenant from year to year, which can only be\r\nterminated by one party or the other giving the necessary six months'\r\nnotice to quit at the term corresponding with the commencement of the\r\noriginal tenancy. This tenancy at sufferance applies also to an\r\nunder-tenant, who remains in possession and pays rent to the reversioner\r\nor head landlord. A six months' notice will be insufficient for this\r\ntenancy. A notice was given (in Right v. Darby, I.T.R. 159) to quit a\r\nhouse held by plaintiff as tenant from year to year, on the 17th June,\r\n1840, requiring him \"to quit the premises on the 11th October following,\r\nor such other day as his said tenancy might expire.\" The tenancy had\r\ncommenced on the 11th October in a former year, but it was held that\r\nthis was not a good notice for the year ending October 11, 1841. A\r\ntenant from year to year gave his landlord notice to quit, ending the\r\ntenancy at a time within the half-year; the landlord acquiesced at\r\nfirst, but afterwards refused to accept the notice. The tenant quitted\r\nthe premises; the landlord entered, and even made some repairs, but it\r\nwas afterwards held that the tenancy was not determined. A notice to\r\nquit must be such as the tenant may safely act on at the time of\r\nreceiving it; therefore it can only be given by an agent properly\r\nauthorized at the time, and cannot be made good by the landlord adopting\r\nit afterwards. An unqualified notice, given at the proper time, should\r\nconclude with \"On failure whereof, I shall require you to pay me double\r\nthe former rent for so long as you retain possession.\"\r\n\r\n2702. LEASES.--A lease is an instrument in writing, by which one person\r\ngrants to another the occupation and use of lands or tenements for a\r\nterm of years for a consideration, the lessor granting the lease, and\r\nthe lessee accepting it with all its conditions. A lessor may grant the\r\nlease for any term less than his own interest. A tenant for life in an\r\nestate can only grant a lease for his own life. A tenant for life,\r\nhaving power to grant a lease, should grant it only in the terms of the\r\npower, otherwise the lease is void, and his estate may be made to pay\r\nheavy penalties under the covenant, usually the only one onerous on the\r\nlessor, for quiet enjoyment. The proprietor of a freehold--that is, of\r\nthe possession in perpetuity of lands or tenements--may grant a lease\r\nfor 999 years, for 99 years, or for 3 years. In the latter case, the\r\nlease may be either verbal or in writing, no particular form and no\r\nstamps being necessary, except the usual stamp on agreements; so long as\r\nthe intention of the parties is clearly expressed, and the covenants\r\ndefinite, and well understood by each party, the agreement is complete,\r\nand the law satisfied. In the case of settled estates, the court of\r\nChancery is empowered to authorize leases under the 19 & 20 Vict. c.\r\n120, and 21 & 22 Vict. c. 77, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  21 years for agriculture or occupation.\r\n  40 years for water-power.\r\n  99 years for building-leases.\r\n  60 years for repairing-leases.\r\n\r\n2703. A lessor may also grant an under-lease for a term less than his\r\nown: to grant the whole of his term would be an assignment. Leases are\r\nfrequently burdened with a covenant not to underlet without the consent\r\nof the landlord: this is a covenant sometimes very onerous, and to be\r\navoided, where it is possible, by a prudent lessee.\r\n\r\n2704. A lease for any term beyond three years, whether an actual lease\r\nor an agreement for one, must be in the form of a deed; that is, it must\r\nbe \"under seal;\" and all assignments and surrenders of leases must be in\r\nthe same form, or they are _void at law_. Thus an agreement made by\r\nletter, or by a memorandum of agreement, which would be binding in most\r\ncases, would be valueless when it was for a lease, unless witnessed, and\r\ngiven under hand and seal. The last statute, 8 & 9 Vict. c. 106, under\r\nwhich these precautions became necessary, has led to serious\r\ndifficulties. \"The judges,\" says Lord St. Leonards, \"feel the difficulty\r\nof holding a lease in writing, but not by deed, to be altogether void,\r\nand consequently decided, that although such a lease is void under the\r\nstatute, yet it so far regulates the holding, that it creates a tenancy\r\nfrom year to year, terminable by half a year's notice; and if the tenure\r\nendure for the term attempted to be created by the void lease, the\r\ntenant may be evicted at the end of the term without any notice to\r\nquit.\" An agreement for a lease not by deed has been construed to be a\r\nlease for a term of years, and consequently void under the statute; \"and\r\nyet,\" says Lord St. Leonards, \"a court of equity has held that it may be\r\nspecifically enforced as an agreement upon the terms stated.\" The law on\r\nthis point is one of glorious uncertainty; in making any such agreement,\r\ntherefore, we should be careful to express that it is an agreement, and\r\nnot a lease; and that it is witnessed and under seal.\r\n\r\n2705. AGREEMENTS.--It is usual, where the lease is a repairing one, to\r\nagree for a lease to be granted on completion of repairs according to\r\nspecification. This agreement should contain the names and designation\r\nof the parties, a description of the property, and the term of the\r\nintended lease, and all the covenants which are to be inserted, as no\r\nverbal agreement can be made to a written agreement. It should also\r\ndeclare that the instrument is an agreement for a lease, and not the\r\nlease itself. The points to be settled in such an agreement are, the\r\nrent, term, and especially covenants for insuring and rebuilding in the\r\nevent of a fire; and if it is intended that the lessor's consent is to\r\nbe obtained before assigning or underleasing, a covenant to that effect\r\nis required in the agreement. In building-leases, usually granted for 99\r\nyears, the tenant is to insure the property; and even where the\r\nagreement is silent on that point, the law decides it so. It is\r\notherwise with ordinary tenements, when the tenant pays a full, or what\r\nthe law terms rack-rent; the landlord is then to insure, unless it is\r\notherwise arranged by the agreement.\r\n\r\n2706. It is important for lessee, and lessor, also, that the latter does\r\nnot exceed his powers. A lease granted by a tenant for life before he is\r\nproperly in possession, is void in law; for, although a court of equity,\r\naccording to Lord St. Leonards, will, \"by force of its own jurisdiction,\r\nsupport a _bonâ fide_ lease, granted under a power which is merely\r\nerroneous in form or ceremonies,\" and the 12 & 13 Vict. c. 26, and 13 &\r\n14 Vict. c. 19, compel a new lease to be granted with the necessary\r\nvariations, while the lessor has no power to compel him to accept such a\r\nlease, except when the person in remainder is competent and willing to\r\nconfirm the original lease without variations, yet all these\r\ndifficulties involve both delay, costs, and anxieties.\r\n\r\n2707. In husbandry leases, a covenant to cultivate the land in a\r\nhusbandlike manner, and according to the custom of the district, is\r\nalways implied; but it is more usual to prescribe the course of tillage\r\nwhich is to be pursued. In the case of houses for occupation, the tenant\r\nwould have to keep the house in a tenantable state of repair during the\r\nterm, and deliver it up in like condition. This is not the case with the\r\ntenant at will, or from year to year, where the landlord has to keep the\r\nhouse in tenantable repair, and the tenant is only liable for waste\r\nbeyond reasonable wear and tear.\r\n\r\n2708. INSURANCE.--Every lease, or agreement for a lease, should covenant\r\nnot only who is to pay insurance, but how the tenement is to be rebuilt\r\nin the event of a fire; for if the house were burnt down, and no\r\nprovision made for insurance, the tenant, supposing there was the\r\nordinary covenant to repair in the lease, would not only have to\r\nrebuild, but to pay rent while it was being rebuilt. More than this,\r\nsupposing, under the same lease, the landlord had taken the precaution\r\nof insuring, he is not compelled to lay out the money recovered in\r\nrebuilding the premises. Sir John Leach lays it down, that \"the tenant's\r\nsituation could not be changed by a precaution, on the part of the\r\nlandlord, with which he had nothing to do.\" This decision Lord Campbell\r\nconfirmed in a more recent case, in which an action was brought against\r\na lessee who was not bound to repair, and neither he nor the landlord\r\nbound to insure; admitting an equitable defence, the court affirmed Sir\r\nJohn Leach's decision, holding that the tenant was bound to pay the\r\nrent, and could not require the landlord to lay out the insurance money\r\nin rebuilding. This is opposed to the opinion of Lord St. Leonards, who\r\nadmits, however, that the decision of the court must overrule his\r\n_dictum_. Such being the state of the law, it is very important that\r\ninsurance should be provided for, and that the payment of rent should be\r\nmade to depend upon rebuilding the house in the event of a fire. Care\r\nmust be taken, however, that this is made a covenant of the lease, as\r\nwell as in the agreement, otherwise the tenant must rebuild the house.\r\n\r\n2709. The law declares that a tenant is not bound to repair damages by\r\ntempest, lightning, or other natural casualty, unless there is a special\r\ncovenant to that effect in the lease; but if there is a general covenant\r\nto repair, the repair will fall upon the tenant. Lord Kenyon lays it\r\ndown, in the case of a bridge destroyed by a flood, the tenant being\r\nunder a general covenant to repair, that, \"where a party, by his own\r\ncontract, creates a duty or charge upon himself, he is bound to make it\r\ngood, because he might have guarded against it in the contract.\" The\r\nsame principle of law has been applied to a house destroyed by\r\nlightning. It is, therefore, important to have this settled in the\r\ninsurance clause.\r\n\r\n2710. Lord St. Leonards asserts that \"his policies against fire are not\r\nso framed as to render the company _legally_ liable.\" Generally the\r\nproperty is inaccurately described with reference to the conditions\r\nunder which you insure. They are framed by companies who, probably, are\r\nnot unwilling to have a legal defence against any claim, as they intend\r\nto pay what they deem just claim without taking advantage of any\r\ntechnical objection, and intending to make use of their defence only\r\nagainst what they believe to be a fraud, although they may not be able\r\nto prove it. \"But,\" says his lordship, \"do not rely upon the moral\r\nfeelings of the directors. Ascertain that your house falls strictly\r\nwithin the conditions. Even having the surveyor of the company to look\r\nover your house before the insurance will not save you, unless your\r\npolicy is correct.\" This is true; but probably his lordship's legal\r\njealousy overshoots the mark here. Assurance companies only require an\r\nhonest statement of the facts, and that no concealment is practised with\r\ntheir surveyor; and the case of his own, which he quotes, in which a\r\nglass door led into a conservatory, rendering it, according to the view\r\nof the company, \"hazardous,\" and consequently voiding the policy, when a\r\nfire did occur, the company paid, rather than try the question; but even\r\nafter the fire they demurred, when called upon, to make the description\r\ncorrect and indorse on the policy the fact that the drawing-room opened\r\nthrough a glass door into conservatories. One of two inferences is\r\nobvious here; either his lordship has overcoloured the statement, or the\r\ncompany could not be the respectable one represented. The practice with\r\nall reputable offices is to survey the premises before insurance, and to\r\ndescribe them as they appear; but no concealment of stoves, or other\r\ndangerous accessories or inflammable goods, should be practised. This\r\ncertainly binds the office so long as no change takes place; but the\r\naddition of any stove, opening, or door through a party wall, the\r\nintroduction of gunpowder, saltpetre, or other inflammable articles into\r\nthe premises without notice, very properly \"voids the policy.\" The usual\r\ncourse is to give notice of all alterations, and have them indorse on\r\nthe policy, as additions to the description of the property: there is\r\nlittle fear, where this is honestly done, that any company would adopt\r\nthe sharp practice hinted at in Lord St. Leonards' excellent handy book.\r\n\r\n2711. BREAKS IN THE LEASE.--Where a lease is for seven, fourteen, or\r\ntwenty-one years, the option to determine it at the end of the first\r\nterm is in the tenant, unless it is distinctly agreed that the option\r\nshall be mutual, according to Lord St. Leonards.\r\n\r\n2712. NOXIOUS TRADES.--A clause is usually introduced prohibiting the\r\ncarrying on of any trade in some houses, and of noxious or particular\r\ntrades in others. This clause should be jealously inspected, otherwise\r\ngreat annoyance may be produced. It has been held that a general clause\r\nof this description prohibited a tenant from keeping a school, for which\r\nhe had taken it, although a lunatic asylum and public-house have been\r\nfound admissible; the keeping an asylum not being deemed a trade, which\r\nis defined as \"conducted by buying and selling.\" It is better to have\r\nthe trades, or class of trades objected to, defined in the lease.\r\n\r\n2713. FIXTURES.--In houses held under lease, it has been the practice\r\nwith landlords to lease the bare walls of the tenement only, leaving the\r\nlessee to put in the stoves, cupboards, and such other conveniences as\r\nhe requires, at his own option. Those, except under particular\r\ncircumstances, are the property of the lessee, and may either be sold to\r\nan incoming tenant, or removed at the end of his term. The articles\r\nwhich may not be removed are subject to considerable doubt, and are a\r\nfruitful source of dispute. Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque has defined as\r\ntenants' property all goods and chattels; 2ndly, all articles \"slightly\r\nconnected one with another, and with the freehold, but capable of being\r\nseparated without materially injuring the freehold;\" 3rdly, articles\r\nfixed to the freehold by nails and screws, bolts or pegs, are also\r\ntenants' goods and chattels; but when sunk in the soil, or built on it,\r\nthey are integral parts of the freehold, and cannot be removed. Thus, a\r\ngreenhouse or conservatory attached to the house by the tenant is not\r\nremovable; but the furnace and hot-water pipes by which it is heated,\r\nmay be removed or sold to the in-coming tenant. A brick flue does not\r\ncome under the same category, but remains. Window-blinds, grates,\r\nstoves, coffee-mills, and, in a general sense, everything he has placed\r\nwhich can be removed without injury to the freehold, he may remove, if\r\nthey are separated from the tenement during his term, and the place made\r\ngood. It is not unusual to leave the fixtures in their place, with an\r\nundertaking from the landlord that, when again let, the in-coming tenant\r\nshall pay for them, or permit their removal. In a recent case, however,\r\na tenant having held over beyond his term and not removed his fixtures,\r\nthe landlord let the premises to a new tenant, who entered into\r\npossession, and would not allow the fixtures to be removed--it was held\r\nby the courts, on trial, that he was justified. A similar case occurred\r\nto the writer: he left his fixtures in the house, taking a letter from\r\nthe landlord, undertaking that the in-coming tenant should pay for them\r\nby valuation, or permit their removal. The house was let; the landlord\r\ndied. His executors, on being applied to, pleaded ignorance, as did the\r\ntenant, and on being furnished with a copy of the letter, the executors\r\ntold applicant that if he was aggrieved, he knew his remedy; namely, an\r\naction at law. He thought the first loss the least, and has not altered\r\nhis opinion.\r\n\r\n2714. TAXES.--Land-tax, sewers-rate, and property-tax, are landlord's\r\ntaxes; but by 30 Geo. II. c. 2, the occupier is required to pay all\r\nrates levied, and deduct from the rent such taxes as belong to the\r\nlandlord. Many landlords now insert a covenant, stipulating that\r\nland-tax and sewers-rate are to be paid by the tenants, and not\r\ndeducted: this does not apply to the property-tax. All other taxes and\r\nrates are payable by the occupier.\r\n\r\n2715. WATER-RATE, of course, is paid by the tenant. The water-companies,\r\nas well as gas-companies, have the power of cutting off the supply; and\r\nmost of them have also the right of distraining, in the same manner as\r\nlandlords have for rent.\r\n\r\n2716. NOTICE TO QUIT.--In the case of leasing for a term, no notice is\r\nnecessary; the tenant quits, as a matter of course, at its termination;\r\nor if, by tacit consent, he remains paying rent as heretofore, he\r\nbecomes a tenant at sufferance, or from year to year. Half a year's\r\nnotice now becomes necessary, as we have already seen, to terminate the\r\ntenancy; except in London, and the rent is under forty shillings, when a\r\nquarter's notice is sufficient. Either of these notices may be given\r\nverbally, if it can be proved that the notice was definite, and given at\r\nthe right time. Form of notice is quite immaterial, provided it is\r\ndefinite and clear in its purport.\r\n\r\n2717. Tenancy for less than a year may be terminated according to the\r\ntaking. Thus, when taken for three months, a three months' notice is\r\nrequired; when monthly, a month's notice; and when weekly, a week's\r\nnotice; but weekly tenancy is changed to a quarterly tenure if the rent\r\nis allowed to stand over for three months. When taken for a definite\r\ntime, as a month, a week, or a quarter, no notice is necessary on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\n2718. DILAPIDATIONS.--At the termination of a lease, supposing he has\r\nnot done so before, a landlord can, and usually does, send a surveyor to\r\nreport upon the condition of the tenement, and it becomes his duty to\r\nferret out every defect. A litigious landlord may drag the outgoing\r\ntenant into an expensive lawsuit, which he has no power to prevent. He\r\nmay even compel him to pay for repairing improvements which he has\r\neffected in the tenement itself, if dilapidations exist. When the lessor\r\ncovenants to do all repairs, and fails to do so, the lessee may repair,\r\nand deduct the cost from the rent.\r\n\r\n2719. RECOVERY OF RENT.--The remedies placed in the hands of landlords\r\nare very stringent. The day after rent falls due, he may proceed to\r\nrecover it, by action at law, by distress on the premises, or by action\r\nof ejectment, if the rent is half a year in arrear. Distress is the\r\nremedy usually applied, the landlord being authorized to enter the\r\npremises, seize the goods and chattels of his tenant, and sell them, on\r\nthe fifth day, to reimburse himself for all arrears of rent and the\r\ncharges of the distress. There are a few exceptions; but, generally, all\r\ngoods found on the premises may be seized. The exceptions are--dogs,\r\nrabbits, poultry, fish, tools and implements of a man's trade actually\r\nin use, the books of a scholar, the axe of a carpenter, wearing apparel\r\non the person, a horse at the plough, or a horse he may be riding, a\r\nwatch in the pocket, loose money, deeds, writings, the cattle at a\r\nsmithy forge, corn sent to a mill for grinding, cattle and goods of a\r\nguest at an inn; but, curiously enough, carriages and horses standing at\r\nlivery at the same inn may be taken. Distress can only be levied in the\r\ndaytime, and if made after the tender of arrears, it is illegal. If\r\ntender is made after the distress, but before it is _impounded_, the\r\nlandlord must abandon the distress and bear the cost himself. Nothing of\r\na perishable nature, which cannot be restored in the same condition--as\r\nmilk, fruit, and the like, must be taken.\r\n\r\n2720. The law does not regard a day as consisting of portions. The\r\npopular notion that a notice to quit should be served before noon is an\r\nerror. Although distraint is one of the remedies, it is seldom advisable\r\nin a landlord to resort to distraining for the recovery of rent. If a\r\ntenant cannot pay his rent, the sooner he leaves the premises the\r\nbetter. If he be a rogue and won't pay, he will probably know that nine\r\nout of ten distresses are illegal, through the carelessness, ignorance,\r\nor extortion of the brokers who execute them. Many, if not most, of the\r\nrespectable brokers will not execute distresses, and the business falls\r\ninto the hands of persons whom it is by no means desirable to employ.\r\n\r\n2721. Powers to relieve landlords of premises, by giving them legal\r\npossession, are given by 19 & 20 Vict., cap. 108, to the county courts,\r\nin cases where the rent does not exceed £50 per annum, and under the\r\ncircumstances hereinafter mentioned; i.e.:--\r\n\r\n    1. Where the term has expired, or been determined by notice to\r\n    quit.\r\n\r\n    2. Where there is one half-year's rent in arrear, and _the\r\n    landlord shall have right by law to enter for the nonpayment\r\n    thereof_. As proof of this power is required, the importance of\r\n    including such a power in the agreement for tenancy will be\r\n    obvious.\r\n\r\nIn the county courts the amount of rent due may be claimed, as well as\r\nthe possession of the premises, in one summons.\r\n\r\n2722. When a tenant deserts premises, leaving one half-year's rent in\r\narrear, possession may be recovered by means of the police-court. The\r\nrent must not exceed £20 per annum, and must be at least three-fourths\r\nof the value of the premises. In cases in which the tenant has not\r\ndeserted the premises, and where notice to quit has been given and has\r\nexpired, the landlord must give notice to the tenant of his intended\r\napplication. The annual rent in this case, also, must not exceed £20.\r\n\r\n2723. THE I. O. U.--The law is not particular as to orthography; in\r\nfact, it distinctly refuses to recognize the existence of that\r\ndelightful science. You may bring your action against Mr. Jacob\r\nPhillips, under the fanciful denomination of Jaycobb Fillipse, if you\r\nlike, and the law won't care, because the law goes by ear; and, although\r\nit insists upon having everything written, things written are only\r\nsupposed in law to have any meaning when read, which is, after all, a\r\ncommon-sense rule enough. So, instead of \"I owe you,\" persons of a\r\ncheerful disposition, so frequently found connected with debt, used to\r\nwrite facetiously I. O. U., and the law approved of their so doing. An\r\nI. O. U. is nothing more than a written admission of a debt, and may run\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n                                           15th October, 1860.\r\n  To Mr. W. BROWN.\r\n\r\n                  I. O. U. ten pounds for coals.\r\n\r\n  £10.                                            JOHN JONES.\r\n\r\nIf to this you add the time of payment, as \"payable in one month from\r\nthis date,\" your I. O. U. is worthless and illegal; for it thus ceases\r\nto be a mere acknowledgment, and becomes a promissory note. Now a\r\npromissory note requires a stamp, which an I. O. U. does not. Many\r\npersons, nevertheless, stick penny stamps upon them, probably for\r\nornamental effect, or to make them look serious and authoritative. If\r\nfor the former purpose, the postage-stamp looks better than the receipt\r\nstamp upon blue paper. If you are W. Brown, and you didn't see the I. O.\r\nU. signed, and can't find anybody who knows Jones's autograph, and Jones\r\nwon't pay, the I. O. U. will be of no use to you in the county court,\r\nexcept to make the judge laugh. He will, however, allow you to prove the\r\nconsideration, and as, of course, you won't be prepared to do anything\r\nof the sort, he will, if you ask him politely, adjourn the hearing for a\r\nweek, when you can produce the coalheavers who delivered the article,\r\nand thus gain a glorious victory.\r\n\r\n2724. APPRENTICES.--By the statute 5 Eliz. cap. 4, it is enacted that,\r\nin cases of ill-usage by masters towards apprentices, or of neglect of\r\nduty by apprentices, the complaining party may apply to a justice of the\r\npeace, who may make such order as equity may require. If, for want of\r\nconformity on the part of the master, this cannot be done, then the\r\nmaster may be bound to appear at the next sessions. Authority is given\r\nby the act to the justices in sessions to discharge the apprentice from\r\nhis indentures. They are also empowered, on proof of misbehaviour of the\r\napprentice, to order him to be corrected or imprisoned with hard labour.\r\n\r\n2725. HUSBAND AND WIFE.--Contrary to the vulgar opinion, second cousins,\r\nas well as first, may legally marry. When married, a husband is liable\r\nfor his wife's debts contracted before marriage. A creditor desirous of\r\nsuing for such a claim should proceed against both. It will, however, be\r\nsufficient if the husband be served with process, the names of both\r\nappearing therein, thus:--John Jones and Ann his wife. A married woman,\r\nif sued alone, may plead her marriage, or, as it is called in law,\r\ncoverture. The husband is liable for debts of his wife contracted for\r\nnecessaries while living with him. If she voluntarily leaves his\r\nprotection, this liability ceases. He is also liable for any debts\r\ncontracted by her with his authority. If the husband have abjured the\r\nrealm, or been transported by a sentence of law, the wife is liable\r\nduring his absence, as if she were a single woman, for debts contracted\r\nby her.\r\n\r\n2726. In civil cases, a wife may now give evidence on behalf of her\r\nhusband in criminal cases she can neither be a witness for or against\r\nher husband. The case of assault by him upon her forms an exception to\r\nthis rule.\r\n\r\n2727. The law does not at this day admit the ancient principle of\r\nallowing moderate correction by a husband upon the person of his wife.\r\nAlthough this is said to have been anciently limited to the use of \"a\r\nstick not bigger than the thumb,\" this barbarity is now altogether\r\nexploded. He may, notwithstanding, as has been recently shown in the\r\nfamous Agapemone case, keep her under restraint, to prevent her leaving\r\nhim, provided this be effected without cruelty.\r\n\r\n2728. By the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, a wife deserted\r\nby her husband may apply to a magistrate, or to the petty sessions, for\r\nan order to protect her lawful earnings or property acquired by her\r\nafter such desertion, from her husband and his creditors. In this case\r\nit is indispensable that such order shall, within ten days, be entered\r\nat the county court of the district within which she resides. It will be\r\nseen that the basis of an application for such an order is _desertion_.\r\nConsequently, where the parties have separated by common consent, such\r\nan order cannot be obtained, any previous cruelty or misconduct on the\r\nhusband's part notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n2729. When a husband allows his wife to invest money in her own name in\r\na savings-bank, and he survives her, it is sometimes the rule of such\r\nestablishments to compel him to take out administration in order to\r\nreceive such money, although it is questionable whether such rule is\r\nlegally justifiable. Widows and widowers pay no legacy-duty for property\r\ncoming to them through their deceased partners.\r\n\r\n2730. RECEIPTS for sums above £2 should now be given upon penny stamps.\r\nA bill of exchange may nevertheless be discharged by an indorsement\r\nstating that it has been paid, and this will not be liable to the stamp.\r\nA receipt is not, as commonly supposed, conclusive evidence as to a\r\npayment. It is only what the law terms _primâ facie_ evidence; that is,\r\ngood until contradicted or explained. Thus, if A sends wares or\r\nmerchandise to B, with a receipt, as a hint that the transaction is\r\nintended to be for ready money, and B detain the receipt without paying\r\nthe cash, A will be at liberty to prove the circumstances and to recover\r\nhis claim. The evidence to rebut the receipt must, however, be clear and\r\nindubitable, as, after all, written evidence is of a stronger nature\r\nthan oral testimony.\r\n\r\n2731. BOOKS OF ACCOUNT.--A tradesman's books of account cannot be\r\nreceived as evidence in his own behalf, unless the entries therein be\r\nproved to have been brought under the notice of, and admitted to be\r\ncorrect by the other party, as is commonly the case with the\r\n\"pass-books\" employed backwards and forwards between bakers, butchers,\r\nand the like domestic traders, and their customers. The defendant may,\r\nhowever, compel the tradesman to produce his books to show entries\r\nadverse to his own claim.\r\n\r\n2732. WILLS.--The last proof of affection which we can give to those left\r\nbehind, is to leave their worldly affairs in such a state as to excite\r\nneither jealousy, nor anger, nor heartrendings of any kind, at least for\r\nthe immediate future. This can only be done by a just, clear, and\r\nintelligible disposal of whatever there is to leave. Without being\r\nadvocates for every man being his own lawyer, it is not to be denied\r\nthat the most elaborately prepared wills have been the most fruitful\r\nsources of litigation, and it has even happened that learned judges left\r\nwills behind them which could not be carried out. Except in cases where\r\nthe property is in land or in leases of complicated tenure, very\r\nelaborate details are unnecessary; and we counsel no man to use words in\r\nmaking his will of which he does not perfectly understand the meaning\r\nand import.\r\n\r\n2733. All men over twenty-one years of age, and of sound mind, and all\r\nunmarried women of like age and sanity, may by will bequeath their\r\nproperty to whom they please. Infants, that is, all persons under\r\ntwenty-one years of age, and married women, except where they have an\r\nestate to their \"own separate use,\" are incapacitated, without the\r\nconcurrence of the husband; the law taking the disposal of any property\r\nthey die possessed of. A person born deaf and dumb cannot make a will,\r\nunless there is evidence that he could read and comprehend its contents.\r\nA person convicted of felony cannot make a will, unless subsequently\r\npardoned; neither can persons outlawed; but the wife of a felon\r\ntransported for life may make a will, and act in all respects as if she\r\nwere unmarried. A suicide may bequeath real estate, but personal\r\nproperty is forfeited to the crown.\r\n\r\n2734. Except in the case of soldiers on actual service, and sailors at\r\nsea, every will must be made in writing. It must be signed by the\r\ntestator, or by some other person in his presence, and at his request,\r\nand the signature must be made or acknowledged in the presence of two or\r\nmore witnesses, who are required to be present at the same time, who\r\ndeclare by signing that the will was signed by the testator, or\r\nacknowledged in their presence, and that they signed as witnesses in\r\ntestator's presence.\r\n\r\n2735. By the act of 1852 it was enacted that no will shall be valid\r\nunless signed at the foot or end thereof by the testator, or by some\r\nperson in his presence, and by his direction; but a subsequent act\r\nproceeds to say that every will shall, as far only as regards the\r\nposition of the signature of the testator, or of the person signing for\r\nhim, be deemed valid if the signature shall be so placed at, or after,\r\nor following, or under, or beside, or opposite to the end of the will,\r\nthat it shall be apparent on the face of it that the testator intended\r\nto give it effect by such signature. Under this clause, a will of\r\nseveral sheets, all of which were duly signed, except the last one, has\r\nbeen refused probate; while, on the other hand, a similar document has\r\nbeen admitted to probate where the last sheet only, and none of the\r\nother sheets, was signed. In order to be perfectly formal, however, each\r\nseparate sheet should be numbered, signed, and witnessed, and attested\r\non the last sheet. This witnessing is an important act: the witnesses\r\nmust subscribe it in the presence of the testator and of each other; and\r\nby their signature they testify to having witnessed the signature of the\r\ntestator, he being in sound mind at the time. Wills made under any kind\r\nof coercion, or even importunity may become void, being contrary to the\r\nwishes of the testator. Fraud or imposition also renders a will void,\r\nand where two wills made by the same person happen to exist, neither of\r\nthem dated, the maker of the wills is declared to have died intestate.\r\n\r\n2736. A will may always be revoked and annulled, but only by burning or\r\nentirely destroying the writing, or by adding a codicil, or making a\r\nsubsequent will duly attested; but as the alteration of a will is only a\r\nrevocation to the extent of the alteration, if it is intended to revoke\r\nthe original will entirely, such intention should be declared,--no\r\nmerely verbal directions can revoke a written will; and the act of\r\nrunning the pen through the signatures, or down the page, is not\r\nsufficient to cancel it, without a written declaration to that effect\r\nsigned and witnessed.\r\n\r\n2737. A will made before marriage is revoked thereby.\r\n\r\n2738. A codicil is a supplement or addition to a will, either explaining\r\nor altering former dispositions; it may be written on the same or\r\nseparate paper, and is to be witnessed and attested in the same manner\r\nas the original document.\r\n\r\n2739. WITNESSES.--Any persons are qualified to witness a will who can\r\nwrite their names; but such witness cannot be benefitted by the will. If\r\na legacy is granted to the persons witnessing, it is void. The same rule\r\napplies to the husband or wife of a witness; a bequest made to either of\r\nthese is void.\r\n\r\n2740. FORM OF WILLS.--Form is unimportant, provided the testator's\r\nintention is clear. It should commence with his designation; that is,\r\nhis name and surname, place of abode, profession, or occupation. The\r\nlegatees should also be clearly described. In leaving a legacy to a\r\nmarried woman, if no trustees are appointed over it, and no specific\r\ndirections given, \"that it is for her sole and separate use, free from\r\nthe control, debts, and incumbrances of her husband,\" the husband will\r\nbe entitled to the legacy. In the same manner a legacy to an unmarried\r\nwoman will vest in her husband after marriage, unless a settlement of it\r\nis made on her before marriage.\r\n\r\n2741. In sudden emergencies a form may be useful, and the following has\r\nbeen considered a good one for a death-bed will, where the assistance of\r\na solicitor could not be obtained; indeed, few solicitors can prepare a\r\nwill on the spur of the moment: they require time and legal forms, which\r\nare by no means necessary, before they can act.\r\n\r\n    I, A.B., of No. 10, ----, Street, in the city of ----\r\n    [gentleman, builder, or grocer, as the case may be,] being of\r\n    sound mind, thus publish and declare my last will and testament.\r\n    Revoking and annulling all former dispositions of my property, I\r\n    give and bequeath as follows:--to my son J.B., of ----, I give\r\n    and bequeath the sum of ---; to my daughter M., the wife of J.,\r\n    of ----, I give and bequeath the sum of ---- [if intended for\r\n    her own use, add \"to her sole and separate use, free from the\r\n    control, debts, and incumbrances of her husband\"], both in\r\n    addition to any sum or sums of money or other property they have\r\n    before had from me. All the remaining property I die possessed\r\n    of I leave to my dear wife M. B., for her sole and separate use\r\n    during her natural life, together with my house and furniture,\r\n    situate at No. 10, ---- Street, aforesaid. At her death, I\r\n    desire that the said house shall be sold, with all the goods and\r\n    chattels therein [or, I give and bequeath the said house, with\r\n    all the goods and chattels therein, to ----], and the money\r\n    realized from the sale, together with that in which my said wife\r\n    had a life-interest, I give and bequeath in equal moieties to my\r\n    son and daughter before named. I appoint my dear friend T.S., of\r\n    ----, and T.B., of ----, together with my wife M.B., as\r\n    executors to this my last will and testament.\r\n\r\n    Signed by A.B., this 10th day of October, 1861, in our presence,\r\n    both being present together, and both having signed as\r\n    witnesses, in the presence of the testator:--A.B.\r\n\r\n    T.S., Witness. F.M., Witness.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that the signature of the testator after this\r\nattestation has been signed by the witnesses, is not a compliance with\r\nthe act; he must sign first.\r\n\r\n2742. STAMP-DUTIES.--In the case of persons dying intestate, when their\r\neffects are administered to by their family, the stamp-duty is half as\r\nmuch more as it would have been under a will. Freehold and copyhold\r\nestates are now subject to a special impost on passing, by the Stamp Act\r\nof 1857.\r\n\r\n2743. The legacy-duty only commences when it amounts to £20 and upwards;\r\nand where it is not directed otherwise, the duty is deducted from the\r\nlegacy.\r\n\r\n2744. You cannot compound for past absence of charity by bequeathing\r\nland or tenements, or money to purchase such, to any charitable use, by\r\nyour last will and testament; but you may devise them to the British\r\nMuseum, to either of the two universities of Oxford and Cambridge, to\r\nEton, Winchester, and Westminster; and you may, if so inclined, leave it\r\nfor the augmentation of Queen Anne's bounty. You may, however, order\r\nyour executors to sell land and hand over the money received to any\r\ncharitable institution.\r\n\r\n2745. In making provision for a wife, state whether it is in lieu of, or\r\nin addition to, dower.\r\n\r\n2746. If you have advanced money to any child, and taken an\r\nacknowledgment for it, or entered it in any book of account, you should\r\ndeclare whether any legacy left by will is in addition to such advance,\r\nor whether it is to be deducted from the legacy.\r\n\r\n2747. A legacy left by will to any one would be cancelled by your\r\nleaving another legacy by a codicil to the same person, unless it is\r\nstated to be in addition to the former bequest.\r\n\r\n2748. Your entire estate is chargeable with your debts, except where the\r\nreal estate is settled. Let it be distinctly stated out of which\r\nproperty, the real or personal, they are paid, where it consists of\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n2749. Whatever is _devised_, let the intention be clearly expressed, and\r\nwithout any condition, if you intend it to take effect.\r\n\r\n2750. Attestation is not necessary to a will, as the act of witnessing\r\nis all the law requires, and the will itself declares the testator to be\r\nof sound mind in his own estimation; but, wherever there are erasures or\r\ninterlineations, one becomes necessary. No particular form is\r\nprescribed; but it should state that the testator either signed it\r\nhimself, or that another signed it by his request, or that he\r\nacknowledged the signature to be his in their presence, both being\r\npresent together, and signed as witnesses in his presence. When there\r\nare erasures, the attestation must declare that--The words interlined in\r\nthe third line of page 4, and the erasure in the fifth line of page 6,\r\nhaving been first made. These are the acts necessary to make a properly\r\nexecuted will; and, being simple in themselves and easily performed,\r\nthey should be strictly complied with, and always attested.\r\n\r\n2751. A witness may, on being requested, sign for testator; and he may\r\nalso sign for his fellow-witness, supposing he can only make his mark,\r\ndeclaring that he does so; but a husband cannot sign for his wife,\r\neither as testator or witness, nor can a wife for her husband.",
