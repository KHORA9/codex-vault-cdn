On special occasions, such as First of October Addresses at the\r\nopening of the Medical Schools, or the Orations delivered before the\r\nvarious Medical Societies, certain periods of medical history are\r\nreferred to, and a few of the great names of the founders of medical\r\nand surgical science are held up to the admiration of the audience.\r\nFrom time to time excellent monographs on the subject appear in the\r\n_Lancet_ and _British Medical Journal_. But with the exception of these\r\nbrilliant electric flashes, the History of Medicine is a dark continent\r\nto English students who have not made long and tedious researches in\r\nour great libraries. For it is a remarkable fact that the History of\r\nMedicine has been almost completely neglected by English writers.\r\nThis cannot be due either to the want of importance or interest of\r\nthe subject. Next to the history of religion ranks in interest and\r\nvalue that of medicine, and it would not be difficult to show that\r\nreligion itself cannot be understood in its development and connections\r\nwithout reference to medicine. The priest and the physician are own\r\nbrothers, and the Healing Art has always played an important part in\r\nthe development of all the great civilisations. The modern science of\r\nAnthropology has placed at the disposal of the historian of medicine\r\na great number of facts which throw light on the medical theories of\r\nprimitive and savage man. But most of these have hitherto remained\r\nuncollected, and are not easily accessible to the general reader.\r\n\r\nAlthough English writers have so strangely neglected this important\r\nfield of research, the Germans have explored it in the most exhaustive\r\nmanner. The great works of Sprengel, Haeser, Baas, and Puschmann,\r\namongst many others of the same class, sustain the claim that Germany\r\nhas created the History of Medicine, whilst the well-known but\r\nincomplete treatise of Le Clerc shows what a great French writer could\r\ndo to make this _terra incognita_ interesting.\r\n\r\nNot that Englishmen have entirely neglected this branch of literature.\r\nDr. Freind, beginning with Galen’s period, wrote a _History of Physic\r\nto the Commencement of the Sixteenth Century_. Dr. Edward Meryon\r\ncommenced a _History of Medicine_, of which Vol. I. only appeared\r\n(1861). In special departments Drs. Adams, Greenhill, Aikin, Munk,\r\nWise, Royle, and others have made important contributions to the\r\nliterature of the subject; but we have nothing to compare with\r\nthe great German works whose authors we have mentioned above. The\r\nencyclopædic work of Dr. Baas has been translated into English by Dr.\r\nHanderson of Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\nSprengel’s work is translated into French, and Dr. Puschmann’s\r\nadmirable volume on Medical Education has been given in English by Mr.\r\nEvan Hare.\r\n\r\nNone of these important and interesting works, valuable as they are to\r\nthe professional man, are quite suitable for the general reader, who,\r\nit seems to the present writer, is entitled in these latter days to be\r\nadmitted within the inner courts of the temple of Medical History, and\r\nto be permitted to trace the progress of the mystery of the Healing\r\nArt from its origin with the medicine-man to its present abode in our\r\nMedical Schools.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of an occasional note or brief reference in his\r\ntext-books of medicine and surgery, the student of medicine has little\r\ninducement to direct his attention to the work of the great pioneers of\r\nthe science he is acquiring.\r\n\r\nOne consequence of this defect in his education is manifested in the\r\ncommon habit of considering that all the best work of discoverers in\r\nthe Healing Art has been done in our own times. “History of medicine!”\r\nexclaimed a hospital surgeon a few months since. “Why, there was none\r\ntill forty years ago!” This habit of treating contemptuously the\r\nscientific and philosophical work of the past is due to imperfect\r\nacquaintance with, or absolute ignorance of, the splendid labours\r\nof the men of old time, and can only be remedied by devoting some\r\nlittle study to the records of travellers who have preceded us on the\r\nsame path we are too apt to think we have constructed for ourselves.\r\nProfessor Billroth declared, “that the great medical faculties should\r\nmake it a point of honour to take care that lectures on the history of\r\nmedicine are not missing in their curricula.” And at several German\r\nuniversities some steps in this direction have been taken. In England,\r\nhowever—so far as I am aware—nothing of the sort has been attempted,\r\nand a young man may attain the highest honours of his profession\r\nwithout the ghost of an idea about the long and painful process through\r\nwhich it has become possible for him to acquire his knowledge.\r\n\r\nSays Dr. Nathan Davis,[1] “A more thorough study of the history of\r\nmedicine, and in consequence, a greater familiarity with the successive\r\nsteps or stages in the development of its several branches, would\r\nenable us to see more clearly the real relations and value of any\r\nnew fact, induction, or remedial agent that might be proposed. It\r\nwould also enable us to avoid a common error of regarding facts,\r\npropositions, and remedies presented under new names, as really new,\r\nwhen they had been well known and used long before, but in connection\r\nwith other names or theories.” He adds that, “The only remedy for these\r\npopular and unjust errors is a frequent recurrence to the standard\r\nauthors of the past generation, or in other words, an honest and\r\nthorough study of the history of medicine as a necessary branch of\r\nmedical education.”\r\n\r\nIn these times, when no department of science is hidden from the\r\nuninitiated, especially when medical subjects and the works of medical\r\nmen are freely discussed in our great reviews and daily journals, no\r\napology seems necessary for withdrawing the professional veil and\r\nadmitting the laity behind the scenes of professional work.\r\n\r\nMedicine now has no mysteries to conceal from the true student of\r\nnature and the scientific inquirer. Her methods and her principles are\r\nopen to all who care to know them; the only passport she requires is\r\nreverence, her only desire to satisfy the yearning to know. In this\r\nspirit and for these ends this work has been conceived and given to the\r\nworld. “The proper study of mankind is man.”\r\n\r\n  EDWARD BERDOE.\r\n\r\n  TYNEMOUTH HOUSE,\r\n  VICTORIA PARK GATE,\r\n  LONDON, _April 22nd, 1893_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      SPRENGEL GIVES THE FOLLOWING TABLE OF THE GREAT PERIODS IN\r\n                       THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE:—\r\n\r\n\r\n     I.

Not only do they treat\r\nthemselves when injured or ill, but they assist each other. Dogs and\r\ncats use various natural medicines, chiefly emetics and purgatives, in\r\nthe shape of grasses and other plants. The fibrous-rooted wheat-grass,\r\n_Triticum caninum_, sometimes called dog’s-wheat, is eaten medicinally\r\nby dogs. Probably other species, such as _Agrostis caninia_, brown\r\nbent-grass, are used in like manner.[3]\r\n\r\nMr. George Jesse describes another kind of “dog-grass,” _Cynosurus\r\ncristatus_, as a natural medicine, both emetic and purgative, which is\r\nresorted to by the canine species when suffering from indigestion and\r\nother disorders of the stomach. Every druggist’s apprentice knows how\r\nremarkably fond cats are of valerian root (_Valeriana officinalis_).\r\nThis strong-smelling root acts on these animals as an intoxicant, and\r\nthey roll over and over the plant with the wildest delight when brought\r\ninto contact with it. Cats are extravagantly fond of cat-mint (_Nepeta\r\ncataria_). It has a powerful odour, like that of pennyroyal. There is\r\nno evidence, however, that these plants have any medicinal properties\r\nfor which they are used by cats, they are merely enjoyed by them on\r\naccount of their perfume.\r\n\r\nDr. W. Lauder Lindsay, in his _Mind in the Lower Animals_, says that\r\nthe Indian mongoose, poisoned by the snake which it attacks, uses the\r\nantidote to be found in the _Mimosa octandra_.[4]\r\n\r\n“Its value both as a cure and as a preventive is said to be well known\r\nto it. Whenever in its battles with serpents it receives a wound, it\r\nat once retreats, goes in search of the antidote, and having found and\r\ndevoured it, returns to the charge, and generally carries the day,\r\nseeming none the worse for its bite.”[5] This, however, is probably a\r\nfable of the Hindus.\r\n\r\n“A toad, bit or stung by a spider, repeatedly betook itself to a plant\r\nof _Plantago major_ (the Greater Plantain), and ate a portion of its\r\nleaf, but died after repeated bites of the spider, when the plant had\r\nbeen experimentally removed by man.”[6]\r\n\r\nThe medicinal uses of the hellebore were anciently believed to have\r\nbeen discovered by the goat.\r\n\r\n“Virgil reports of dittany,” says More, in his _Antidote to Atheism_,\r\n“that the wild goats eat it when they are shot with darts.” The\r\nancients said that the art of bleeding was first taught by the\r\nhippopotamus, which thrusts itself against a sharp-pointed reed in the\r\nriver banks, when it thinks it needs phlebotomy.\r\n\r\nIf man had not yet learned the medicinal properties of salt, he could\r\ndiscover them by the greedy licking of it by buffaloes, horses, and\r\ncamels. “On the Mongolian camels,” says Prejevalsky, “salt, in whatever\r\nform, acts as an aperient, especially if they have been long without\r\nit.” Rats will submit to the gnawing off of a leg when caught in a\r\ntrap, so that they may escape capture (Jesse). Livingstone says that\r\nthe chimpanzee, soko, or other anthropoid apes will staunch bleeding\r\nwounds by means of their fingers, or of leaves, turf, or grass stuffed\r\ninto them. Animals treat wounds by licking—a very effectual if tedious\r\nmethod of fomentation or poulticing.\r\n\r\nCornelius Agrippa, in his first book of Occult Philosophy, says that\r\nwe have learned the use of many remedies from the animals. “The sick\r\nmagpie puts a bay-leaf into her nest and is recovered. The lion, if\r\nhe be feverish, is recovered by the eating of an ape. By eating the\r\nherb dittany, a wounded stag expels the dart out of its body. Cranes\r\nmedicine themselves with bulrushes, leopards with wolf’s-bane, boars\r\nwith ivy; for between such plants and animals there is an occult\r\nfriendship.”[7]\r\n\r\nSome interesting observations relating to the surgical treatment of\r\nwounds by birds were recently brought by M. Fatio before the Physical\r\nSociety of Geneva. He quotes the case of the snipe, which he has often\r\nobserved engaged in repairing damages. With its beak and feathers it\r\nmakes a very creditable dressing, applying plasters to bleeding wounds,\r\nand even securing a broken limb by means of a stout ligature. On one\r\noccasion he killed a snipe which had on the chest a large dressing\r\ncomposed of down taken from other parts of the body, and securely\r\nfixed to the wound by the coagulated blood. Twice he has brought home\r\nsnipe with interwoven feathers strapped on to the site of fracture of\r\none or other limb. The most interesting example was that of a snipe,\r\nboth of whose legs he had unfortunately broken by a misdirected shot.\r\nHe recovered the animal only the day following, and he then found that\r\nthe poor bird had contrived to apply dressings and a sort of splint to\r\nboth limbs. In carrying out this operation, some feathers had become\r\nentangled around the beak, and, not being able to use its claws to get\r\nrid of them, it was almost dead from hunger when discovered. In a case\r\nrecorded by M. Magnin, a snipe, which was observed to fly away with a\r\nbroken leg, was subsequently found to have forced the fragments into a\r\nparallel position, the upper fragment reaching to the knee, and secured\r\nthem there by means of a strong band of feathers and moss intermingled.\r\nThe observers were particularly struck by the application of a ligature\r\nof a kind of flat-leafed grass wound round the limb in a spiral form,\r\nand fixed by means of a sort of glue.\r\n\r\nLe Clerc thought that the stories of animals teaching men the use of\r\nplants, herbs, etc., meant that men tried them first upon animals\r\nbefore using them for food or medicine. There is no probability of\r\nthis having been so. If men had observed with Linnæus that horses eat\r\naconite with impunity, and had in consequence eaten it themselves,\r\nthe result would have been fatal. Birds and herbivorous animals eat\r\nbelladonna with impunity,[8] and it has very little effect on horses\r\nand donkeys. Goats, sheep, and horses are said by Dr. Ringer to eat\r\nhemlock without ill effects, yet it poisoned Socrates. Henbane has\r\nlittle or no effect on sheep, cows, and pigs. Ipecacuanha does not\r\ncause vomiting in rabbits,[9] and so on.\r\n\r\nProbably from the earliest times man would be led to observe the\r\nbehaviour of animals when suffering from disease or injury. If he could\r\nnot learn much from them in the way of medicine, they could teach him\r\nmany useful arts. In savage man we must seek the beginnings of our\r\ncivilization, and it is in the lowest tribes and those which have not\r\nyet felt the influences of superior races that we must search for the\r\nmost primitive forms of medical ideas and the earliest theories and\r\ntreatment of disease.\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock says:[10] “It is a common opinion that savages are,\r\nas a general rule, only the miserable remnants of nations once more\r\ncivilized; but although there are some well-established cases of\r\nnatural decay, there is no scientific evidence which would justify us\r\nin asserting that this applies to savages in general.”\r\n\r\nDr. E. B. Tylor, in his fascinating work on _Primitive Culture_,\r\nsays:[11] “The thesis which I venture to sustain, within limits, is\r\nsimply this—that the savage state in some measure represents an early\r\ncondition of mankind, out of which the higher culture has gradually\r\nbeen developed or evolved by processes still in regular operation\r\nas of old, the result showing that, on the whole, progress has far\r\nprevailed over relapse. On this proposition the main tendency of human\r\nsociety during its long term of existence has been to pass from a\r\nsavage to a civilized state. It is mere matter of chronicle that modern\r\ncivilization is a development of mediæval civilization, which again is\r\na development from civilization of the order represented in Greece,\r\nAssyria, or Egypt. Then the higher culture being clearly traced back to\r\nwhat may be called the middle culture, the question which remains is,\r\nwhether this middle culture may be traced back to the lower culture,\r\nthat is, to savagery.”\r\n\r\nProviding we can find our savage pure and uncontaminated, it matters\r\nlittle where we seek him; north, south, east, or west, he will be\r\npractically the same for our purpose.\r\n\r\nDr. Robertson says: “If we suppose two tribes, though placed in the\r\nmost remote regions of the globe, to live in a climate nearly of the\r\nsame temperature, to be in the same state of society, and to resemble\r\neach other in the degree of their improvement, they must feel the same\r\nwants, and exert the same endeavours to supply them.... In every part\r\nof the earth the progress of man has been nearly the same, and we\r\ncan trace him in his career from the rude simplicity of savage life,\r\nuntil he attains the industry, the arts, and the elegance of polished\r\nsociety.”[12]\r\n\r\nWriting of the primitive folk, the Eastern Inoits, Elie Reclus tells us\r\nthat,[13] “shut away from the rest of the world by their barriers of\r\nice, the Esquimaux, more than any other people, have remained outside\r\nforeign influences, outside the civilization whose contact shatters and\r\ntransforms. They have been readily perceived by prehistoric science\r\nto offer an intermediate type between man as he is and man as he was\r\nin bygone ages. When first visited, they were in the very midst of\r\nthe stone and bone epoch,[14] just as were the Guanches when they\r\nwere discovered; their iron and steel are recent, almost contemporary\r\nimportations. The lives of Europeans of the Glacial period cannot have\r\nbeen very different from those led amongst their snow-fields by the\r\nInoits of to-day.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nANIMISM.\r\n\r\n Who discovered our Medicines?—Anthropology can assist us to answer\r\n the Question.—The Priest and the Medicine-man originally one.—Disease\r\n the Work of Magic.—Origin of our Ideas of the Soul and Future\r\n Life.—Disease-demons.\r\n\r\n\r\nCardinal Newman, in his sermon on “The World’s Benefactors,” asks, “Who\r\nwas the first cultivator of corn? Who first tamed and domesticated the\r\nanimals whose strength we use, and whom we make our food? Or who first\r\ndiscovered the medicinal herbs, which from the earliest times have been\r\nour resource against disease? If it was mortal man who thus looked\r\nthrough the vegetable and animal worlds, and discriminated between the\r\nuseful and the worthless, his name is unknown to the millions whom he\r\nhas thus benefited.\r\n\r\n“It is notorious that those who first suggest the most happy inventions\r\nand open a way to the secret stores of nature; those who weary\r\nthemselves in the search after truth; strike out momentous principles\r\nof action; painfully force upon their contemporaries the adoption of\r\nbeneficial measures; or, again, are the original cause of the chief\r\nevents in national history,—are commonly supplanted, as regards\r\ncelebrity and reward, by inferior men. Their works are not called after\r\nthem, nor the arts and systems which they have given the world. Their\r\nschools are usurped by strangers, and their maxims of wisdom circulate\r\namong the children of their people, forming perhaps a nation’s\r\ncharacter, but not embalming in their own immortality the names of\r\ntheir original authors.”\r\n\r\nThe reflection is an old one; the son of Sirach said, “And some there\r\nbe, which have no memorial; who are perished, as though they had never\r\nbeen; and are become as though they had never been born; and their\r\nchildren after them. But these were merciful men, whose righteousness\r\nhath not been forgotten” (_Ecclesiasticus_ xliv. 9, 10). Cardinal\r\nNewman has framed his question, so far as the healing art is concerned,\r\nin a manner to which it is impossible to make a satisfactory answer. No\r\none man first discovered the medicinal herbs; probably the discovery\r\nof all the virtues of a single one of them was not the work of any\r\nindividual. No man “looked through the vegetable and animal worlds\r\nand discriminated between the useful and the worthless”; all this\r\nhas been the work of ages, and is the outcome of the experience of\r\nthousands of investigators. The medical arts have played so important\r\na part in the development of our civilization, that they constitute a\r\nbranch of study second to none in utility and interest to those who\r\nwould know something of the work of the world’s benefactors. Probably\r\nat no period in the world’s history have medical men occupied a more\r\nhonourable or a more prominent position than they do at the present\r\ntime, and it would almost seem that the rewards which an ignorant or\r\nungrateful civilization denied in the past to medical men are now being\r\nbestowed on those who in these latter days have been so fortunate as to\r\ninherit the traditions and the acquirements of a forgotten ancestry of\r\ntruth-seekers and students of the mysteries of nature. As the earliest\r\nraces of mankind passed by slow degrees from a state of savagery to\r\nthe primitive civilizations, we must seek for the beginnings of the\r\nmedical arts in the representatives of the ancient barbarisms which are\r\nto be found to-day in the aborigines of Central Africa and the islands\r\nof Australasian seas. The intimate connection which exists between\r\nthe magician, the sorcerer, and the “medicine man” of the present day\r\nserves to illustrate how the priest, the magician, and the physician\r\nof the past were so frequently combined in a single individual, and to\r\nexplain how the mysteries of religion were so generally connected with\r\nthose of medicine.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tylor has explained how death and all forms of disease\r\nwere attributed to magic, the essence of which is the belief in the\r\ninfluence of the spirits of dead men. This belief is termed Animism,\r\nand Mr. Tylor says: “Animism characterizes tribes very low in the scale\r\nof humanity, and thence ascends, deeply modified in its transmission,\r\nbut from first to last preserving an unbroken continuity, into the\r\nmidst of high culture. Animism is the groundwork of the philosophy\r\nof religion, from that of the savages up to that of civilized men;\r\nbut although it may at first seem to afford but a meagre and bare\r\ndefinition of a minimum of religion, it will be found practically\r\nsufficient; for where the roots are, the branches will generally\r\nbe produced. The theory of animism divides into two great dogmas,\r\nforming parts of one consistent doctrine: first, concerning souls of\r\nindividual creatures, capable of continued existence after death;\r\nsecond, concerning other spirits, upward to the rank of powerful\r\ndeities. Spiritual beings are held to affect or control the events of\r\nthe material world, and man’s life here and hereafter; and it being\r\nconsidered that they hold intercourse with men and receive pleasure or\r\ndispleasure from human actions, the belief in their existence leads\r\nnaturally, sooner or later, to active reverence and propitiation.”\r\nThere is no doubt that the belief in the soul and in the existence of\r\nthe spirits of the departed in another world arose from dreams. When\r\nthe savage in his sleep held converse, as it seemed to him, with the\r\nactual forms of his departed relatives and friends, the most natural\r\nthing imaginable would be the belief that these persons actually\r\nexisted in a spiritual shape in some other world than the material\r\none in which he existed. Those who dreamed most frequently and most\r\nvividly, and were able to describe their visions most clearly, would\r\nnaturally strive to interpret their meaning, and would become, to\r\ntheir grosser and less poetical brethren, more important personages,\r\nand be considered as in closer converse with the spiritual world than\r\nthemselves. Thus, in process of time, the seer, the prophet, and the\r\nmagician would be evolved.\r\n\r\nHow did primitive man come by his ideas? When he saw the effects of a\r\npower, he could only make guesses at the cause; he could only speak\r\nof it by some such terms as he would use concerning a human agent. He\r\nsaw the effects of fire, and personified the cause. With the Hindus\r\nAgni was the giver of light and warmth, and so of the life of plants,\r\nof animals, and of men; and so with thunder, lightning, and storm,\r\nprimitive man looked upon these phenomena as the conflicts of beings\r\nhigher and more powerful than himself. Thus it was that the ancient\r\npeople of India formed their conceptions of the storm-gods, the Maruts,\r\n_i.e._ the Smashers. Amongst the Esthonians, as Max Müller tells\r\nus,[15] prayers were addressed to thunder and rain as late as the\r\nseventeenth century. “Dear Thunder, push elsewhere all the thick black\r\nclouds. Holy Thunder, guard our seed-field.” (This same thunder-god,\r\n_Perkuna_, says Max Müller, was the god _Parganya_, who was invoked\r\nin India a thousand years before Alexander’s expedition.) We say _it_\r\nrains, _it_ thunders. Primitive folk said the rain-god poured out his\r\nbuckets, the thunder-god was angry.\r\n\r\nWhat did primitive man think when he observed the germination of seeds;\r\nthe chick coming out of the egg; the butterfly bursting from the\r\nchrysalis; the shadow which everywhere accompanies the man; the shadows\r\nof the tree; the leaves which vibrate in the breeze; when he heard\r\nthe roaring of the wind; the moaning of the storm, and the strange,\r\nmysterious echo which, plainly as he heard it, ceased as he approached\r\nthe mountain-side which he conceived to be its home? He could but\r\nbelieve that all nature was living, like himself; and that, as he could\r\nnot understand what he saw in the seed, the egg, the chrysalis, or the\r\nshadow, so all nature was full of mystery, of a life that he in vain\r\nwould try to comprehend. Many savages regard their own shadows as one\r\nof their two souls,—a soul which is always watching their actions, and\r\nready to bear witness against them. How should it be otherwise with\r\nthem? The shadow is a reality to the savage, and so is the echo. The\r\nship which visits his shores, the watch and the compass, which he sees\r\nfor the first time, are alive; they move, they must be living!\r\n\r\nMr. Tylor, in his chapter on Animism, in his _Primitive Culture_, says\r\n(vol. ii. pp. 124, 125):—\r\n\r\n“As in normal conditions the man’s soul, inhabiting his body, is held\r\nto give it life, to think, speak, and act through it, so an adaptation\r\nof the self-same principle explains abnormal conditions of body or\r\nmind, by considering the new symptoms as due to the operation of a\r\nsecond soul-like being, a strange spirit. The possessed man, tossed and\r\nshaken in fever, pained and wrenched as though some live creature were\r\ntearing or twisting him within, pining as though it were devouring his\r\nvitals day by day, rationally finds a personal spiritual cause for his\r\nsufferings. In hideous dreams he may even sometimes see the very ghost\r\nor nightmare-fiend that plagues him. Especially when the mysterious,\r\nunseen power throws him helpless to the ground, jerks and writhes him\r\nin convulsions, makes him leap upon the bystanders with a giant’s\r\nstrength and a wild beast’s ferocity, impels him, with distorted face\r\nand frantic gesture, and voice not his own, nor seemingly even human,\r\nto pour forth wild incoherent raving, or with thought and eloquence\r\nbeyond his sober faculties, to command, to counsel, to foretell—such a\r\none seems to those who watch him, and even to himself, to have become\r\nthe mere instrument of a spirit which has seized him or entered into\r\nhim—a possessing demon in whose personality the patient believes so\r\nimplicitly that he often imagines a personal name for it, which it\r\ncan declare when it speaks in its own voice and character through his\r\norgans of speech; at last, quitting the medium’s spent and jaded body,\r\nthe intruding spirit departs as it came. This is the savage theory\r\nof demoniacal possession and obsession, which has been for ages, and\r\nstill remains, the dominant theory of disease and inspiration among\r\nthe lower races. It is obviously based on an animistic interpretation,\r\nmost genuine and rational in its proper place in man’s intellectual\r\nhistory, of the natural symptoms of the cases. The general doctrine\r\nof disease-spirits and oracle-spirits appears to have its earliest,\r\nbroadest, and most consistent position within the limits of savagery.\r\nWhen we have gained a clear idea of it in this its original home, we\r\nshall be able to trace it along from grade to grade of civilization,\r\nbreaking away piecemeal under the influence of new medical theories,\r\nyet sometimes expanding in revival, and, at least, in lingering\r\nsurvival holding its place into the midst of our modern life. The\r\npossession-theory is not merely known to us by the statements of those\r\nwho describe diseases in accordance with it. Disease being accounted\r\nfor by attacks of spirits, it naturally follows that to get rid of\r\nthese spirits is the proper means of cure. Thus the practices of the\r\nexorcist appear side by side with the doctrine of possession, from its\r\nfirst appearance in savagery to its survival in modern civilization;\r\nand nothing could display more vividly the conception of a disease or\r\na mental affliction as caused by a personal spiritual being than the\r\nproceedings of the exorcist who talks to it, coaxes or threatens it,\r\nmakes offerings to it, entices or drives it out of the patient’s body,\r\nand induces it to take up its abode in some other.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSAVAGE THEORIES OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\nDemoniacal.—Witchcraft.—Offended Dead Persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find amongst savages three chief theories of disease; that it is\r\ncaused by—\r\n\r\nI. The anger of an offended demon.\r\n\r\nII. Witchcraft, or\r\n\r\nIII. Offended dead persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. ANGER OF OFFENDED DEMONS.\r\n\r\nDisease and death are set down to the influences of spirits in the\r\nAustralian-Tasmanian district, where demons are held to have the\r\npower of creeping into men’s bodies, to eat up their livers, and\r\nsometimes to work the wicked will of a sorcerer by inflicting blows\r\nwith a club on the back of the victim’s neck.[16] The Mantira, a low\r\nrace of the Malay Peninsula, believe in the theory of disease-spirits\r\nin its extreme form; their spirits cause all sorts of ailments. The\r\n“Hantu Kalumbahan” causes small-pox; the “Hantu Kamang” brings on\r\ninflammation and swelling of the hands and feet; the blood which flows\r\nfrom wounds is due to the “Hantu-pari,” which fastens on the wound\r\nand sucks. So many diseases, so many Hantus. If a new malady were to\r\nappear amongst the tribes, a new Hantu would be named as its cause.[17]\r\nWhen small-pox breaks out amongst these people, they place thorns and\r\nbrush in the paths to keep the demons away. The Khonds of Orissa try\r\nto defend themselves against the goddess of small-pox, Jugah Pensu,\r\nin the same way. Among the Dayaks of Borneo, to have been ill is to\r\nhave been smitten by a spirit; invisible spirits inflict invisible\r\nwounds with invisible spears, or they enter bodies and make them mad.\r\nDisease-spirits in the Indian Archipelago are conciliated by presents\r\nand dances. In Polynesia, every sickness is set down to deities which\r\nhave been offended, or which have been urged to afflict the sufferer by\r\ntheir enemies.[18] In New Zealand disease is supposed to be due to a\r\nbaby, or undeveloped spirit, which is gnawing the patient’s body. Those\r\nwho endeavour to charm it away persuade it to get upon a flax-stalk and\r\ngo home. Each part of the body is the particular region of the spirit\r\nwhose office it is to afflict it.[19]\r\n\r\nThe Prairie Indians treat all diseases in the same way, as they must\r\nall have been caused by one evil spirit.[20]\r\n\r\nAmong the Betschvaria disease may be averted if a painted stone or\r\na crossbar smeared with medicine be set up near the entrance of the\r\nresidence or approach to a town.[21]\r\n\r\nAmongst the Bodo and Dhimal peoples, when the exorcist is called to\r\na sick man he sets thirteen loaves round him, to represent the gods,\r\none of whom he must have offended; then he prays to the deity, holding\r\na pendulum by a string. The offended god is supposed to cause the\r\npendulum to swing towards his loaf.[22]\r\n\r\nThe New Zealanders had a separate demon for each part of the body\r\nto cause disease. Tonga caused headache and sickness; Moko-Tiki was\r\nresponsible for chest pains, and so on.[23]\r\n\r\nThe Karens of Burmah and the Zulus both say, “The rainbow is disease.\r\nIf it rests on a man, something will happen to him.”[24] “The rainbow\r\nhas come to drink wells.” They say, “Look out; some one or other will\r\ncome violently by an evil death.”\r\n\r\nThe Tasmanians lay their sick round a corpse on the funeral pile, that\r\nthe dead may come in the night and take out the devils that cause the\r\ndiseases.[25]\r\n\r\nThe Zulus believe that spirits, when angry, seize a living man’s body\r\nand inflict disease and death, and when kindly disposed give health and\r\ncattle. In Madagascar, Mr. Tylor tells us, the spirits of the Vazimbas,\r\nthe aborigines of the island, inflict diseases, and the Malagasy\r\naccounts for all sorts of mysterious complaints by the supposition\r\nthat he has given offence to some Vazimba. The Gold Coast negroes\r\nbelieve that ghosts plague the living and cause sickness. The Dayaks\r\nof Borneo think that the souls of men enter the trunks of trees, and\r\nthe Hindus hold that plants are sometimes the homes of the spirits of\r\nthe departed. The Santals of Bengal believe that the spirits of the\r\ngood enter into fruit-bearing trees.[26] It is but another step to the\r\nbelief that beneficent medicinal plants are tenanted by good spirits,\r\nand poisonous plants by evil spirits. The Malays have a special demon\r\nfor each kind of disease; one for small-pox, another for swellings, and\r\nso on.[27]\r\n\r\nThe Dayaks of Borneo acknowledge a supreme God, although, as we have\r\nsaid, they attribute all kinds of diseases and calamities to the\r\nmalignity of evil spirits. Their system of medicine consists in the\r\napplication of appropriate charms or the offering of conciliatory\r\nsacrifices.[28] Yet they are an intelligent and highly capable race,\r\nand their steel instruments far surpass European wares in strength and\r\nfineness of edge.[29]\r\n\r\nThe Javanese, nominally Mahometans, are really believers in the\r\nprimitive animism of their ancestry. They worship numberless spirits;\r\nall their villages have patron saints, to whom is attributed all\r\nthat happens to the inhabitants, good or bad. Mentik causes the rice\r\ndisease; Sawan produces convulsions in children; Dengen causes gout and\r\nrheumatism.[30]\r\n\r\nThe religion of Siam is a corrupted Buddhism; spirits and demons (nats\r\nor phees) are worshipped and propitiated. Some of these malignant\r\nbeings cause children to sicken and die. Talismans are worked into the\r\nornamentation of the houses to avert their evil influence.[31]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. L. Wilson[32] says: “Demoniacal possessions are common,\r\nand the feats performed by those who are supposed to be under such\r\ninfluence are certainly not unlike those described in the New\r\nTestament. Frantic gestures, convulsions, foaming at the mouth, feats\r\nof supernatural strength, furious ravings, bodily lacerations, grinding\r\nof teeth, and other things of a similar character, may be witnessed in\r\nmost of the cases.”\r\n\r\nIn Finnish mythology, which introduces us to ideas of extreme\r\nantiquity, we find the disease-demon theory in all its force.\r\n\r\nThe _Tietajat_, “the learned,” and the _Noijat_, or sorcerers, claimed\r\nthe power to cure diseases by expelling the demons which caused them,\r\nby incantations assisted by drugs; these magicians were the only\r\nphysicians of the nation. The _Tietajat_ and the _Noijat_, however,\r\nwere not magicians of the same class: the former practised “white\r\nmagic,” or “sacred science”; the latter practised “black magic,” or\r\nsorcery. Evil spirits, poisons, and malice were the chief aids to\r\npractice in the latter; while _Tietajat_, by means of learning and the\r\nassistance of benevolent supernatural beings, devote themselves to the\r\nwelfare of the people. The three highest deities of Finnish mythology,\r\nUkko, Wäinämöinen, and Ilmarinen, corresponded to three superior gods\r\nof the Accadian magic collection, Ana, Hea, and Mut-ge. Wäinämöinen was\r\nthe great spirit of life, the master of favourable spells, conqueror\r\nof evil, and sovereign possessor of science. The sweat which dropped\r\nfrom his body was a balm for all diseases. It was he alone who could\r\nconquer all the demons. Every disease was itself a demon. The invasion\r\nof the disorder was an actual possession. Finnish magic was chiefly\r\nmedical, being used to cure diseases and wounds.[33] The Finns believed\r\ndiseases to be the daughters of Louhiatar, the demon of diseases.\r\nPleurisy, gout, colic, consumption, leprosy, and the plague were all\r\ndistinct personages. By the help of conjurations, these might be buried\r\nor cooked in a brazen vessel. When the priest made his diagnosis he had\r\nto be in a state of divine ecstasy, and then by incantation, assisted\r\nby drugs, he proceeded to exorcise the demon. The Finnish incantations\r\nbelonged to the same family as those of the Accadians. Professor\r\nLenormant translates from the great Epopee of the _Kalevala_ one of the\r\nincantations:—\r\n\r\n“O malady, disappear into the heavens; pain, rise up to the clouds;\r\ninflamed vapour, fly into the air, in order that the wind may take thee\r\naway, that the tempest may chase thee to distant regions, where neither\r\nsun nor moon give their light, where the warm wind does not inflame the\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n“O pain, mount upon the winged steed of stone, and fly to the mountains\r\ncovered with iron. For he is too robust to be devoured by disease, to\r\nbe consumed by pains.\r\n\r\n“Go, O diseases, to where the virgin of pains has her hearth, where the\r\ndaughter of Wäinämöinen cooks pains,—go to the hill of pains.\r\n\r\n“These are the white dogs, who formerly hurled torments, who groaned in\r\ntheir sufferings.”\r\n\r\nAnother incantation against the plague was discovered by Ganander, and\r\nis given by Lenormant:—\r\n\r\n“O scourge, depart; plague, take thy flight, far from the bare flesh.\r\n\r\n“I will give thee a horse, with which to escape, whose shoes shall not\r\nslide on ice;” and so on.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish ceremony expelled the scapegoat to the desert; the Accadian\r\nbanished the disease-demons to the desert of sand; the Finnish magician\r\nsent his disease-demons to Lapland.\r\n\r\nThe goddess Suonetar was the healer and renewer of flesh:—\r\n\r\n“She is beautiful, the goddess of veins, Suonetar, the beneficent\r\ngoddess! She knits the veins wonderfully with her beautiful spindle,\r\nher metal distaff, her iron wheel.\r\n\r\n“Come to me, I invoke thy help; come to me, I call thee. Bring in thy\r\nbosom a bundle of flesh, a ball of veins to tie the extremity of the\r\nveins.”[34]\r\n\r\n“All diseases are attributed by the Thibetans to the four elements, who\r\nare propitiated accordingly in cases of severe illness. The winds are\r\ninvoked in cases of affections of the breathing; fire in fevers and\r\ninflammations; water in dropsy, and diseases whereby the fluids are\r\naffected; and the god of earth when solid organs are diseased, as in\r\nliver complaints, rheumatism, etc. Propitiatory offerings are made to\r\nthe deities of these elements, but never sacrifices.”[35]\r\n\r\nHooker tells of a case of apoplexy which was treated by a Lama, who\r\nperched a saddle on a stone, and burning incense before it, scattered\r\nrice to the winds, invoking the various mountain peaks in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIn Hottentot mythology Gaunab is a malevolent ghost, who kills people\r\nwho die what we call a “natural” death. Unburied men change into this\r\nsort of vampire.[36]\r\n\r\nThe demoniacal theory of at least one class of disease is found in the\r\nBible, although the New Testament in one passage distinguishes between\r\nlunatics and demoniacs. In Matthew iv. 24 we read that they brought\r\nto Jesus “those which were possessed with devils, and those which\r\nwere lunatick.” Epilepsy is evidently the disease described in Mark\r\nix. 17-26, though the symptoms are attributed to possession by a dumb\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. WITCHCRAFT AS A CAUSE OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\nSorcerers and magicians not only use evil words and cast evil glances\r\nat the persons whom they wish to afflict, but they endeavour to obtain\r\npossession of some article which has belonged to the individual, or\r\nsomething connected more closely with his personality, as parings of\r\nthe nails or a few of his hairs, and through these he professes to\r\nbe able to operate more effectually on the object of his malice. It\r\nis to this use of portions of the body that ignorant persons, even\r\nat the present day, insist that nail-parings, hair-cuttings, and the\r\nlike, shall be at once destroyed by fire. Such superstitions are found\r\nat work all over the world. Mr. Black tells us[37] that the servants\r\nof the chiefs of the South Sea Islanders carefully collect and bury\r\ntheir masters’ spittle in places where sorcerers are not likely to\r\nfind it. He says also it is believed in the West of Scotland that if a\r\nbird used any of the hair of a person’s head in building his nest, the\r\nindividual would be subject to headaches and become bald. Of course the\r\nbird is held to be the embodiment of an evil spirit or witch. Images of\r\npersons to be bewitched are sometimes made in wood or wax, in which has\r\nbeen inserted some of the hair of the victim of the enchantment; the\r\nimage is then buried, and before long some malady attacks the part of\r\nthe bewitched person corresponding to that in which the hair has been\r\nplaced in his effigy. Disease-making is a profession in the island of\r\nTanna in the New Hebrides; the sorcerers collect the skins and shells\r\nof the fruits eaten by any one who is to be punished, they are then\r\nslowly burned, and the victims sicken. Disease-demons are driven away\r\nfrom patients in Alaska by the beating of drums. The size of the drum\r\nand the force of the beating are directly proportioned to the gravity\r\nof the disease. A headache can be dispelled by the gentle tapping of\r\na toy drum; concussion of the brain would require that the big drum\r\nshould be thumped till it broke; if that failed to expel the evil\r\nspirit, there would be nothing left but to strangle the patient.\r\n\r\nThe wild natives of Australia are exceedingly superstitious. Sorcery\r\nenters into every relation of life, and their great fear is lest they\r\nshould be injured by the mysterious influence called _boyl-ya_. The\r\nsorcerers have power to enter the bodies of men and slowly consume\r\nthem; the victim feels the pain as the _boyl-ya_ enters him, and it\r\ndoes not leave him till it is extracted by another sorcerer. While\r\nhe is sleeping, he may be attacked and bewitched by having pointed\r\nat him a leg-bone of a kangaroo, or the sorcerer may steal away his\r\nkidney-fat, where the savage believes that his power resides, or he\r\nmay secretly slay his victim by a blow on the back of his neck. The\r\nmagician may dispose of his victim by procuring a lock of his hair and\r\nroasting it with fat; as it is consumed, so does his victim pine away\r\nand die.\r\n\r\n_Wingo_ is a superstition which some Australian tribes have, that with\r\na rope of fibre they can partially choke a man, by putting it round\r\nhis neck at night while he is asleep, without waking him; his enemy\r\nthen removes his caul-fat from under his short rib, leaving no mark or\r\nwound. When the victim awakes he feels no pain or weakness, but sooner\r\nor later he feels something break in his inside like a string. He then\r\ngoes home and dies at once.[38]\r\n\r\nDr. Watson thus describes the typical medicine-men:—\r\n\r\n“The Tla-guill-augh, or man of supernatural gifts, is supposed to\r\nbe capable of throwing his good or bad medicine, without regard\r\nto distance, on whom he will, and to kill or cure by magic at his\r\npleasure. These medicine-men are generally beyond the meridian of life;\r\ngrave, sedate, and shy, with a certain air of cunning, but possessing\r\nsome skill in the use of herbs and roots, and in the management of\r\ninjuries and external diseases. The people at large stand in great awe\r\nof them, and consult them on every affair of importance.”[39]\r\n\r\nDr. O. L. Möller, Medical Director-General of the Danish army,\r\ndescribes a certain wise woman near Lögstör, who used in her\r\nprescriptions for the sick people who consulted her a charm of willow\r\ntwigs tied together amongst other mystic things, and whose therapeutics\r\nwere of a bloodthirsty character, as she would advise her patients to\r\nstrike the first person they met after returning home, until they drew\r\nblood, for that person would be the cause of the disease.[40]\r\n\r\nThe fact that ghosts and demons are everywhere believed to cause\r\ndiseases, and that sorcery is practised more or less by most of the\r\nraces of man in connection with the causation or cure of disease, has\r\nbeen used as a factor in the argument for the origin of primitive\r\nman from a single pair in accordance with the orthodox belief. Dr.\r\nPickering, the ethnologist, says: “Superstitions also appear to be\r\nsubject to the same laws of progression with communicated knowledge,\r\nand the belief in ghosts, evil spirits, and sorcery, current among the\r\nruder East Indian tribes, in Madagascar, and in a great part of Africa,\r\nseems to indicate that such ideas may have elsewhere preceded a regular\r\nform of mythology.”[41]\r\n\r\nThere has long been practised in the West Indies a species of\r\nwitchcraft called _Obeah_ or _Obi_, supposed to have been introduced\r\nfrom Africa, and which is in reality an ingenious system of poisoning.\r\nMr. Bowrey, Government chemist in Jamaica, connects Obeah-poisoning\r\nwith a plant which grows abundantly in Jamaica and other West Indian\r\nislands, called the “savannah flower,” or “yellow-flowered nightshade”\r\n(_Urechites suberecta_).[42]\r\n\r\nMr. Bowrey concludes that there is some truth in the stories told\r\nof the poisoning by Obeah-men, and that minute doses, frequently\r\nadministered, might cause death without suspicion being aroused.\r\nThe _British Medical Journal_, June 18th, 1892, has the following\r\ninteresting notes on Obeah (p. 1296):—\r\n\r\n“It is difficult to obtain detailed information regarding Obeah\r\npractices. They rest largely on the credence given to superstitious\r\npractices and vulgar quackery by the uneducated in every country, but\r\nthere seems little doubt that among them secret poisoning is included.\r\nBenjamin Moseley (_Medical Tracts_, London, 1800) states that Obi had\r\nits origin, like many customs among the Africans, from the ancient\r\nEgyptians, _Ob_ meaning a demon or magic. Villiers-Stuart (_Jamaica\r\nRevisited_, 1891) says that Obeah in the West African dialects\r\nsignifies serpent, and that the Obeah-men in Jamaica carry (but in\r\ngreatest secrecy, for fear of the penal laws) a stick on which is\r\ncarved a serpent, the emblem being a relic of the serpent worship once\r\nuniversal among mankind, and also that they sacrifice cocks at their\r\nreligious rites. Moseley gives the following account: ‘Obi, for the\r\npurposes of bewitching people or consuming them by lingering illness,\r\nis made of grave-dirt, hair, teeth of sharks and other animals, blood,\r\nfeathers,’ and so on. Mixtures of these are placed in various ways\r\nnear the person to be bewitched. ‘The victims to this nefarious art\r\nin the West Indies among the negroes are numerous. No humanity of the\r\nmaster nor skill in medicine can relieve the poor negro labouring\r\nunder the influence of Obi. He will surely die, and of a disease that\r\nanswers no description in nosology. This, when I first went to the\r\ncolonies, perplexed me. Laws have been made in the West Indies to\r\npunish the Obian practice with death, but they have been impotent and\r\nnugatory. Laws constructed in the West Indies can never suppress the\r\neffect of ideas, the origin of which is in the centre of Africa.’ ‘A\r\nnegro Obi-man will administer a baleful dose from poisonous herbs, and\r\ncalculate its mortal effects to an hour, day, week, month, or year.’\r\nThe missionaries Waddell (_Twenty-nine Years in the West Indies and\r\nCentral Africa_, 1863) and Blyth (_Reminiscences of Missionary Life_,\r\n1851) confirm this account. They are all agreed that similar practices\r\nprevail in West and Central Africa, and that Jamaican Obeah-men use\r\npoisons. Mr. Bowrey informs me that he has examined many Obeah charms,\r\nand confirms Moseley’s account of them. He thinks, however, that among\r\nthe negroes the knowledge of poisons has been rapidly dying out,\r\n‘doctor’s medicine’ and the much-advertised patent medicines having\r\nlargely replaced the drugs of the native practitioners. The belief in\r\nObeah is still, however, almost universal among the black population.\r\nAccording to Sir Spencer St. John (_Hayti, or the Black Republic_,\r\nsecond edition, London, 1889) secret poisoning is a lucrative\r\noccupation in the neighbouring island of Hayti, certain of the people\r\nhaving an intimate knowledge of indigenous poisonous plants and being\r\nexpert poisoners.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. OFFENCE TO THE DEAD AS A CAUSE OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\nHow comes it that all the races of man of which we have any accurate\r\ninformation have some belief or other in spirits good or bad, and of\r\nsome other life than the actual one which they live in their waking\r\nhours? The theologian answers it in his own way, the anthropologist\r\nin his, and perhaps a simpler one. With the religious aspect of the\r\nquestion we are not here concerned, we have merely to consider the\r\nscientific points involved. When the most ignorant savage of the\r\nlowest type falls asleep, he is as sure to dream as his more favoured\r\ncivilized brother. To his companions he appears as though he were\r\ndead, he is motionless and apparently unconscious. He awakes and is\r\nhimself again. What has his spirit or thinking part been doing while\r\nhis body slept? The man has seen various things and places, has even\r\nconversed with friend or foe in his slumbers, has engaged in fights,\r\nhas taken a journey, has had adventures, and yet his body has not\r\nstirred. Naturally enough the explanation most satisfactory is, that\r\nhis soul has temporarily left his body, and has met other souls in a\r\nsimilar condition. He has seen and conversed with his dead friends\r\nor relatives, has been comforted by their presence or alarmed at the\r\nvisitation. Here, then, we have the anthropologist’s “theory of souls\r\nwhere life, mind, breath, shadow, reflexion, dream, vision, come\r\ntogether and account for one another in some such vague, confused way\r\nas satisfies the untaught reasoner.”[43]\r\n\r\nBut the savage goes further than this: he has seen his horse, his dog,\r\nhis canoe, and his spear in his dream, they too must have souls; and\r\nthus he invests with a spiritual essence every material object by which\r\nhe is surrounded. And so we find funeral sacrifices and ceremonies all\r\nover the world which testify to this universal belief of primitive man.\r\nThe ornaments and weapons which are found with the bones of chiefs,\r\nthe warrior’s horses slain at his burial place, the food and drink and\r\npiece of money left with the dead, are intelligible on this theory, and\r\non no other. The savage’s idea of a demon or evil spirit is usually\r\nthat of a soul of a malevolent dead man. The man was his enemy during\r\nlife, he remains his enemy after death; or he owed some acknowledgment\r\nand reward to a spirit who had helped him, he has neglected to pay\r\nhis debt, and he has offended the spirit in consequence. In cases\r\nof fainting, delirium from fever, hysteria, epilepsy, or insanity,\r\nthe savage sees the partial absence of the patient’s soul from his\r\nbody, or the work of a tormenting demon. Demoniacal possession and\r\nthe ceremonies of exorcism are theories readily explainable by facts\r\nwith which the anthropologist is familiar. “The sick Australian will\r\nbelieve that the angry ghost of a dead man has got into him, and is\r\ngnawing his liver; in a Patagonian skin hut the wizards may be seen\r\ndancing, shouting, and drumming, to drive out the evil demon from a man\r\ndown with fever.”[44]\r\n\r\nWhen Prof. Bartram, the anthropologist, was in Burma, his servant was\r\nseized with an apopleptic fit. The man’s wife, of course, attributed\r\nthe misfortune to an angry demon, so she set out for him little heaps\r\nof rice, and was heard praying, “Oh, ride him not! Ah, let him go! Grip\r\nhim not so hard! Thou shalt have rice! Ah, how good that tastes!”\r\n\r\nThe exorcist may so delude himself that he may believe that he has\r\npower to make the demon converse with him. There may be a falsetto\r\nvoice like that of the mediums of modern civilization issuing from\r\nthe patient’s mouth, and the exorcist’s questions and commands may be\r\nanswered, and the evil spirit may consent to leave the sufferer in\r\npeace. In nervous or mental disorders, in cases of defective power\r\nof assimilating food, such a process may exert a soothing and highly\r\nbeneficial influence on the patient who is actively co-operating by his\r\nfaith in his own cure, and so the error both as to the cause of the\r\nmalady and its treatment is perpetuated.\r\n\r\nPrimitive folk think that life is indestructible; what is called death\r\nis but a change of condition to them; even mites and mosquitos are\r\nimmortal.[45]\r\n\r\nThe Tasmanian, when he suffers from a gnawing disease, believes that he\r\nhas unwittingly pronounced the name of a dead man, who, thus summoned,\r\nhas crept into his body, and is consuming his liver. The sick Zulu\r\nbelieves that some dead ancestor he sees in a dream has caused his\r\nailment, wanting to be propitiated with the sacrifice of an ox. The\r\nSamoan thinks that the ancestral souls can get into the heads and\r\nstomachs of living men, and cause their illness and death. These are\r\nexamples of human ghosts having become demons.[46]\r\n\r\nIn the Samoan group people thought that if a man died bearing ill-will\r\ntowards any one, he would be likely to return to trouble him, and\r\ncause sickness and death, taking up his abode in the sufferer’s head,\r\nchest, or stomach. If he died suddenly, they said he had been eaten\r\nby the spirit that took him. In the Georgian and Society Islands evil\r\ndemons cause convulsions and hysterics, or twist the bowels till the\r\nsufferers die writhing in agony. Madmen are thought to be entered by a\r\ngod, so they are treated with great respect; idiots are considered to\r\nbe divinely inspired.[47] Many other races believe in the inspiration\r\nof mentally feeble or insane persons. Amongst the Dacotas spirits of\r\nanimals, trees, stones, or deceased persons are believed to enter the\r\npatient and cause his disease. The medicine-man recites charms over\r\nhim, and making a symbolic representation of the intruding spirit in\r\nbark, shoots it ceremonially; he sucks over the seat of the pain to\r\ndraw the spirit out, and fires guns at it as it escapes.\r\n\r\nThis is just what happened in the West Indies in the time of Columbus.\r\nFriar Roman Paul tells of a native sorcerer who pretended to pull the\r\ndisease from the legs of his patients, blowing it away, and telling it\r\nto begone to the mountain or the sea. He would then pretend to extract\r\nby sucking some stone or bit of flesh, which he declared had been put\r\ninto the patient to cause the disease by a deity in punishment for\r\nsome religious neglect.[48] The Patagonians believed that sickness was\r\ncaused by spirits entering the patient’s body; they considered that an\r\nevil demon held possession of the sick man’s body, and their doctors\r\nalways carried a drum which they struck at the bedside to frighten\r\naway the demons which caused the disorder.[49] The Zulus and Basutos\r\nin Africa teach that ghosts of dead persons are the causes of all\r\ndiseases. Congo tribes believe also that the souls of the dead cause\r\ndisease and death amongst men.\r\n\r\nThe art of medicine in these lands therefore is, for the most part,\r\nmerely an affair of propitiating some offended and disease-causing\r\nspirit. In several parts of Africa mentally deranged persons are\r\nworshipped. Madness and idiocy are explained by the phrase, “he has\r\nfiends.” The Bodo and Dhimal people of North-east India ascribe all\r\ndiseases to a deity who torments the patient, and who must be appeased\r\nby the sacrifice of a hog. With these people naturally the doctor is\r\na sort of priest. As Mr. Tylor says, “Where the world-wide doctrine\r\nof disease-demons has held sway, men’s minds, full of spells and\r\nceremonies, have scarce had room for thought of drugs and regimen.”[50]\r\n\r\nA forest tribe of the Malay Peninsula, called the Original People, are\r\nsaid to have no religion, no idea of any Supreme Being, and no priests;\r\nyet their Puyung, who is a sort of general adviser to the tribe,\r\ninstructs them in sorcery and the doctrine of ghosts and evil spirits.\r\nIn sickness they use the roots and leaves of trees as medicines.\r\nAmongst the Tarawan group of the Coral Islands, Pickering says:\r\n“Divination or sorcery was also known, and the natives paid worship\r\nto the manes or spirits of their departed ancestors.”[51] Probably on\r\ncareful investigation we should find that in these cases the doctrine\r\nof ghosts and the worship of spirits has some connection with the\r\ncausation of disease.\r\n\r\nThe Malagasy profess a religion which is chiefly fetishism. They\r\nbelieve in the life of the spirit, which they call “the essential part\r\nof me,” apart from the body; and they believe that this spirit exists\r\nwhen the body dies. Such “ghosts” they consider can do harm in various\r\nways, especially by causing diseases; consequently they endeavour, as\r\nthe chief means of cure, to appease the offended ghost. Witchcraft and\r\nbelief in charms naturally flourish amongst these people.[52]\r\n\r\nMr. A. W. Howitt says that the Kŭrnai of Gippsland, Australia, believe\r\nthat a man’s spirit (_Yambo_) can leave the body during sleep, and hold\r\nconverse with other disembodied spirits. Another tribe, the Woi-worŭng,\r\ncall this spirit Mūrŭp, and they suppose it leaves the body in a\r\nsimilar manner, the exact moment of its departure being indicated by\r\nthe “snoring” of the sleeper. As a theory of the soul, Mr. Howitt says:\r\n“It may be said of the aborigines I am now concerned with, and probably\r\nof all others, that their dreams are to them as much realities in one\r\nsense, as are the actual events of their waking life. It may be said\r\nthat in this respect they fail to distinguish between the subjective\r\nand objective impressions of the brain, and regard both as real\r\nevents.”[53]\r\n\r\nThey believe that these ghosts live upon plants, that they can\r\nrevisit their old haunts at will, and communicate with the wizards or\r\nmedicine-men on being summoned by them. A celebrated wizard amongst\r\nthe Woi-worŭng caught the spirit of a dying man, and brought it back\r\nunder his ’possum rug, and restored it to the still breathing body just\r\nin time to save his life. The ghosts can kill game with spiritually\r\npoisoned spears. Even the tomahawk has a spirit, and this belief\r\nexplains many burial customs. One of the Woi-worŭng people told Mr.\r\nHowitt that they buried the weapon with the dead man, “so that he might\r\nhave it handy.” Other tribes bury with the corpse the amulets and\r\ncharms used by the deceased during life, in case they may be required\r\nin the spirit-world. The Woi-worŭng believe that their wizards could\r\nsend their deadly magical yark, or rock crystal, against a person they\r\ndesired to kill, in the form of a small whirlwind. They believe that\r\ntheir wizards “go up” at night to the sky, and obtain such information\r\nas they require in their profession. They can also bring away the\r\nmagical apparatus by which some one of another tribe might be injuring\r\nthe health of a member of his own tribe. It is highly probable that\r\nin these Australian beliefs we have the counterparts of those which\r\nwere everywhere held by primitive man. Good spirits are very little\r\nworshipped by savages; they are already well disposed, and need no\r\ninvocation; it is the bad ones who must be propitiated by an infinite\r\nvariety of rites and sacrifices. “Thus,” as Professor Keane says, “has\r\ndemonology everywhere preceded theology.”[54]\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Palmer, in _Notes on Some Australian Tribes_, says that the\r\nGulf tribes believe in spirits which live inside the bark of trees,\r\nand which come out at night to hold intercourse with the doctors, or\r\n“mediums.” These spirits work evil at times. The Kombinegherry tribe\r\nare much afraid of an evil-working spirit called _Tharragarry_, but\r\nthey are protected by a good spirit, _Coomboorah_. The Mycoolon people\r\nbelieve in an invisible spear which enters the body, leaving no outward\r\nsign of its entry. The victim does not even know that he is hurt; he\r\ngoes on hunting, and returns home as usual; in the night he becomes\r\nill, delirious, or mad, and dies in the morning. _Thimmool_ is a\r\npointed leg-bone of a man, which, being held over a blackfellow when\r\nasleep, causes sickness or death. The _Marro_ is the pinion-bone of\r\na hawk, in which hair of an enemy has been fixed with wax. To work a\r\ncharm on him a fire circle is made round it. With this charm they can\r\nmake their enemy sick, or, by prolonging their magic, kill him. When\r\nthey think they have done harm enough, they place the Marro in water,\r\nwhich removes the charm.[55]\r\n\r\nMr. H. H. Johnstone says that the tribes on the Lower Congo bury with\r\nany one of consequence bales of cloth, plates, beads, knives, and other\r\nthings required to set the deceased up in the spirit-life on which he\r\nhas entered. The plates are broken, the beads are crushed, and the\r\nknives bent, so as to kill them, that they too may “die,” and go to the\r\nspirit-land with their owner.[56]\r\n\r\nThis is a valuable confirmation of the doctrine of animism.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Herbert Spencer says:[57] “It is absurd to suppose that\r\nuncivilized man possesses at the outset the idea of ‘natural\r\nexplanation.’” At a great price has civilized man purchased the power\r\nof giving a natural explanation to the phenomena by which he is\r\nsurrounded. As societies grow, as the arts flourish, as painfully,\r\nlittle by little, his experiences accumulate, so does man learn to\r\ncorrect his earlier impressions, and to construct the foundations of\r\nscience. It is the natural, or it would not be the universal, process\r\nfor primitive man to explain phenomena by the simplest methods, and\r\nthese always lead him to his superstitions. It is the only process open\r\nto him. The activity which he sees all around him is controlled by\r\nthe spirits of the dead, and by spirits more or less like those which\r\nanimate his fellow-men.\r\n\r\nClement of Alexandria says that all superstition arises from the\r\ninveterate habit of mankind to make gods like themselves. The deities\r\nhave like passions with their worshippers, “and some say that plagues,\r\nand hailstorms, and tempests, and the like, are wont to take place,\r\nnot alone in consequence of material disturbance, but also through the\r\nanger of demons and bad angels. These can only be appeased by sacrifice\r\nand incantations. Yet some of them are easily satisfied, for when\r\nanimals failed, it sufficed for the magi at Cleone to bleed their own\r\nfingers.”[58]\r\n\r\n“The prophetess Diotima, by the Athenians offering sacrifice previous\r\nto the pestilence, effected a delay of the plague for ten years.”[59]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMAGIC AND SORCERY IN THE TREATMENT OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\n These originated partly in the Desire to cover\r\n Ignorance.—Medicine-men.—Sucking out Diseases.—Origin of\r\n Exorcism.—Ingenuity of the Priests.—Blowing Disease away.—Beelzebub\r\n cast out by Beelzebub.—Menders of Souls.—”Bringing up the\r\n Devil.“—Diseases and Medicines.—Fever Puppets.—Amulets.—Totemism and\r\n Medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Robertson tells us that the ignorant pretenders to medical skill\r\namongst the North American Indians were compelled to cover their\r\nignorance concerning the structure of the human body, and the causes of\r\nits diseases, by imputing the origin of the maladies which they failed\r\nto cure to supernatural influences of a baleful sort. They therefore\r\n“prescribed or performed a variety of mysterious rites, which they\r\ngave out to be of such efficacy as to remove the most dangerous and\r\ninveterate malice. The credulity and love of the marvellous natural\r\nto uninformed men favoured the deception, and prepared them to be the\r\ndupes of those impostors. Among savages, their first physicians are a\r\nkind of conjurers, or wizards, who boast that they know what is past,\r\nand can foretell what is to come. Thus, superstition, in its earliest\r\nform, flowed from the solicitude of man to be delivered from present\r\ndistress, not from his dread of evils awaiting him in a future life,\r\nand was originally ingrafted on medicine, not on religion. One of the\r\nfirst and most intelligent historians of America was struck with this\r\nalliance between the art of divination and that of physic among the\r\npeople of Hispaniola. But this was not peculiar to them. The _Alexis_,\r\nthe _Piayas_, the _Autmoins_, or whatever was the distinguishing\r\nname of the diviners and charmers in other parts of America, were\r\nall physicians of their respective tribes, in the same manner as the\r\n_Buhitos_ of Hispaniola. As their function led them to apply to the\r\nhuman mind when enfeebled by sickness, and as they found it, in that\r\nseason of dejection, prone to be alarmed with imaginary fears, or\r\nassured with vain hopes, they easily induced it to rely with implicit\r\nconfidence on the virtue of their spells and the certainty of their\r\npredictions.”[60]\r\n\r\nThe aborigines of the Amazon have a kind of priests called _Pagés_,\r\nlike the medicine-men of the North American Indians. They attribute all\r\ndiseases either to poison or to the charms of some enemy. Of course,\r\ndiseases caused by magic can only be cured by magic, so these powerful\r\npriest-physicians cure their patients by strong blowing and breathing\r\nupon them, accompanied by the singing of songs and by incantations.\r\nThey are believed to have the power to kill enemies, and to afflict\r\nwith various diseases. As they are much believed in, these _pagés_ are\r\nwell paid for their services. They are acquainted with the properties\r\nof many poisonous plants. One of their poisons most frequently used is\r\nterrible in its effects, causing the tongue and throat, as well as the\r\nintestines, to putrefy and rot away, leaving the sufferer to linger in\r\ntorment for several days.[61]\r\n\r\nAmongst many savage tribes their medicine-men pretend to remove\r\ndiseases by sucking the affected part of the body. They have previously\r\nplaced bits of bone, stones, etc., in their mouths, and they pretend\r\nthey have removed them from the patient, and exhibit them as proofs\r\nof their success. The Shaman, or wizard-priest of the religion still\r\nexisting amongst the peoples of Northern Asia, who pretends to have\r\ndealings with good and evil spirits, is the successor of the priests\r\nof Accad; thus is the Babylonian religion reduced to the level of the\r\nheathenism of Mongolia.\r\n\r\nThe aborigines of the Darling River, New South Wales, believe that\r\nsickness is caused by an enemy, who uses certain charms called the\r\n_Yountoo_ and _Molee_. The _Yountoo_ is made from a piece of bone taken\r\nfrom the leg of a deceased friend. This is wrapped up in a piece of the\r\ndried flesh from the body of another deceased friend. The package is\r\ntied with some hair from the head of a third friend. When this charm\r\nis used against an enemy, it is taken to the camp where he sleeps, and\r\nafter certain rites are performed it is pointed at the person to be\r\ninjured. The doctor of the tribe attributes disease to this sort of\r\nenchantment, and pretends to suck out of his patient the piece of bone\r\nwhich he declares has entered his body and caused the mischief. The\r\n_Molee_ is a piece of white quartz, which is pointed at the victim with\r\nsomewhat similar ceremonies and consequences. The possessors of these\r\npowerful charms take care to hide them from view. When the doctor, or\r\n_Maykeeka_, sucks out the _Yountoo_—bone chip—from his patient, he must\r\nthrow it away. The _Molee_ must be cast into water.\r\n\r\nMr. F. Bonney read a paper on “Some Customs of the Aborigines of the\r\nRiver Darling,” before the Anthropological Society of Great Britain,\r\nMay 8th, 1883, in which the process of curing diseases is described.\r\nHe says: “On one occasion, when I was camped in the Purnanga Ranges,\r\nI watched by the light of a camp-fire a doctor at work, sucking the\r\nback of a woman who was suffering from pains in that part. While she\r\nsat on a log a few yards distant from the camp-fire, he moved about\r\nher, making certain passes with boughs which he held, and then sucked\r\nfor some time the place where pain was felt; at last he took something\r\nfrom his mouth, and, holding it towards the firelight, declared it to\r\nbe a piece of bone. The old women sitting near loudly expressed their\r\nsatisfaction at his success. I asked to be allowed to look at it, and\r\nit was given to me. I carelessly looked at it, and then pretended to\r\nthrow it into the fire, but, keeping it between my fingers, I placed\r\nit in my pocket, when I could do so unobserved; and on the following\r\nmorning, when I examined it by daylight, it proved to be a small\r\nsplinter of wood, and not bone. At the time the patient appeared to\r\nbe very much relieved by the treatment.” Another mode of treatment\r\ndescribed by Mr. Bonney is that of sucking poison, supposed to have\r\nbeen sent into the patient by an enemy, through a string. The patient\r\ncomplained of sickness in the stomach; the woman doctor placed the\r\npatient on her back on the ground, tied a string round the middle of\r\nher naked body, leaving a loose end about eighteen inches long. The\r\ndoctress then began sucking the string, passing the loose end through\r\nher mouth, from time to time spitting blood and saliva into a pot. She\r\nrepeated this many times, until the patient professed to be cured.\r\n\r\nThe people of Timor-laut, near the island of New Guinea, scar\r\nthemselves on the arms and shoulders with red-hot stones, in imitation\r\nof immense small-pox marks, in order to ward off that disease.[62]\r\n\r\nAmong the Kaffirs diseases are all attributed to three causes—either to\r\nbeing enchanted by an enemy, to the anger of certain beings whose abode\r\nappears to be in the rivers, or to the power of evil spirits.[63]\r\n\r\n“Among the Kalmucks,” says Lubbock, “the cures are effected by\r\nexorcising the evil spirit. This is the business of the so-called\r\n‘priests,’ who induce the evil spirit to quit the body of the patient\r\nand enter some other object. If a chief is ill, some other person is\r\ninduced to take his name, and then, as is supposed, the evil spirit\r\npasses into his body.”[64]\r\n\r\nPritchard tells us that “the priests of the Negroes are also the\r\nphysicians, as were the priests of Apollo and Æsculapius. The\r\nnotions which the Negroes entertain of the causes of diseases are\r\nvery different. The Watje attribute them to evil spirits whom they\r\ncall Dobbo. When these are very numerous, they ask of their sacred\r\ncotton-tree permission to hunt them out. Hereupon a chase is appointed,\r\nand they do not cease following the demons with arms and great cries\r\nuntil they have chased them beyond their boundaries. This chase of the\r\nspirits of disease is very customary among many nations of Guinea, who\r\nuniversally believe that many diseases arise from enchantment, and\r\nothers by the direction of the Deity.”[65]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note, as showing the ingenuity of the priests,\r\nthat during the extremely dangerous rainy season the doctors’ remedies\r\nare of very little use; then the priests say this is because the gods\r\nat this particular season are obliged to appear at the court of the\r\nsuperior deity. During their absence at court, the priests cannot\r\nobtain access to them; and as without their advice they could not\r\nefficaciously prescribe, such medicines as they offer have little good\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe Antilles Indians in Columbus’s time went through the pretence of\r\npulling the disease off the patient and blowing it away, telling it to\r\nbegone to the sea or the mountains.\r\n\r\nThat the disease-demon may often be blown away by a plentiful supply of\r\nfresh air is now an article of every hygienist’s creed.\r\n\r\nThe Badaga folk, mountaineers of the Neilgherries, insure their\r\nchildren against accidents and sickness by talismans made of the earth\r\nand ashes of funeral pyres. They think the souls of the departed are so\r\nvexed at finding themselves in a novel condition that they are liable\r\nto kill people even without a motive. When an epidemic breaks out,\r\nthey lay the blame on the person who died last, who is going about the\r\ncountry taking vengeance on his kindred.[66]\r\n\r\nMonier Williams says they endeavour to induce the demon of pestilence,\r\nof typhoid fever, of the plague of rats or caterpillars, to enter into\r\nthe body of a dancer, who acts as a medium and has power to exorcise\r\nthe angry spirit. He has power to let loose rot or farcy amongst the\r\nflocks and herds, so the medium has to be conciliated. The Corumba of\r\nthese mountain people is a wizard, the sicknesses of men and animals\r\nare all set down to his account. “Gratified by the evil reputation\r\nthe Corumba enjoy, they offer to undo what they are supposed to have\r\ndone, to remove the spells they are accused of having cast. The wheat\r\nis smutty, the flocks have the scab? Somebody’s head aches, some one’s\r\nstomach is out of order? One of these rogues turns up, offers to eject\r\nthe demon; as it happens, the evil spirit is one of his particular\r\ncronies! He will cast out Beelzebub by Beelzebub.”[67]\r\n\r\nAmongst the Western Inoits, says Elie Reclus,[68] the magician of the\r\npeople is called _Angakok_, signifying the “Great” or “the Ancient,”\r\nand he is guide, instructor, wonder-worker, physician, and priest.\r\nHe accumulates in himself all influences; “he is public counsellor,\r\njustice of the peace, arbitrator in public and private affairs, artist\r\nof all kinds, poet, actor, buffoon.” Supposed to be in contact and\r\nclose communication with the superior beings of the world of spirits,\r\nand to harbour in his body many demons of various kinds, he is supposed\r\nto be invested with omnipotence, he can chase away the disease-demons,\r\nand put even death itself to flight. The _angakok_ defends his people\r\nfrom the demons who take the form of cancers, rheumatism, paralysis,\r\nand skin diseases. He exorcises the sick man with stale urine, like the\r\nBochiman poison-doctors.[69]\r\n\r\nThe Cambodians exorcise the small-pox demon with the urine of a white\r\nhorse.[70]\r\n\r\nThiers (_Des Superstitions_), quoted by Reclus, says that Slavonic\r\nrustics asperse their cattle with herbs of St. John boiled in urine\r\nto keep ill-luck away from them; and that French peasant women used\r\nto wash their hands in their own urine, or in that of their husbands\r\nand children, to prevent evil enchantments doing them harm. Reclus\r\nsays: “When a diagnosis puzzles an _angakok_, he has recourse to a\r\ntruly ingenious proceeding. He fastens to the invalid’s head a string,\r\nthe other end of which is attached to a stick; this he raises, feels,\r\nbalances on his hand, and turns in every direction. Various operations\r\nfollow, having for their object the forcible removal of the spider\r\nfrom the luckless wretch whose flesh it devours. He will cleanse and\r\nset to rights as much as he is able—whence his name ‘Mender of Souls.’\r\nA wicked witch, present though invisible, can undo the efforts of the\r\nconjurer, and even communicate to him the disease, rendering him the\r\nvictim of his devotion; black magic can display more power than white\r\nmagic. Then, seeing the case to be desperate, the honest _angakok_\r\nsummons, if possible, one or more brethren, and the physicians of souls\r\nstrive in concert to comfort the dying man; with a solemn voice they\r\nextol the felicities of Paradise, chanting softly a farewell canticle,\r\nwhich they accompany lightly upon the drum.”[71]\r\n\r\nThe superstitious natives of the Lower Congo have a singular custom,\r\nwhen anybody dies, of compelling some victim or other to drink a poison\r\nmade from the bark of the _Erythrophlœum guineensis_. It usually acts\r\nas a powerful emetic, and is administered in the hope that it may\r\n“bring up” the devil. Their medicine-man is called _nganga_, and he is\r\ntaught a language quite different from the ordinary tongue, and this\r\nis kept secret from females. “No one,” says Mr. H. H. Johnston (“On\r\nthe Races of the Congo”),[72] “has yet been able to examine into their\r\nsacred tongue.” The use of Latin by civilized doctors is not unlike\r\nthis African custom.\r\n\r\nThe mountaineers of the Neilgherries endeavour to induce the demon they\r\ninvoke to enter into the body of the “medium,” a dancer who pretends\r\nto the intoxication of prophecy. If they can persuade the demon of\r\npestilence or typhoid fever to enter into the medium, it becomes\r\npossible to act upon and influence him.[73]\r\n\r\nThe people of Tartary make a great puppet when fever is prevalent,\r\nwhich they call the Demon of Intermittent Fevers, and which when\r\ncompleted they set up in the tent of the patients.\r\n\r\nMr. Forbes, in his account of the tribes of the island of Timor, says\r\nthat the natives believe all diseases to be the result of sorcery, and\r\nthey carry a variety of herbs and charms to avert its influence. He\r\nsays: “I had as a servant an old man, who one morning complained of\r\nbeing in a very discomposed and generally uncomfortable state, and of\r\nbeing afraid he was going to die. He had seen, he said, the spirit of\r\nhis mother in the night, she had been present by him and had spoken\r\nwith him. He feared, therefore, that he was about to die. He begged\r\nof me some tobacco and rice to offer to her, which I gave him. He\r\nretired a little way to a great stone in the ground, and laying on\r\nit some betel and pinang, with a small quantity of chalk, along with\r\na little tobacco and rice, he repeated for some eight or ten minutes\r\nan invocation which I did not understand. The rice and the chalk he\r\nleft on the stone, which were very shortly after devoured by my fowls;\r\nthe tobacco, betel, and pinang he took away again, to be utilised by\r\nhimself.”[74]\r\n\r\nWhen the medicine-man of these tribes calls to see a patient, he\r\nlooks very closely at him, to endeavour to perceive the sorcerer who\r\nis making him ill. Then he returns to his home and makes up some\r\nmedicines, which the happy patient has not however to swallow, but\r\nthe drugs having been packed by the doctor into a bundle with a small\r\nstone, are thrown away as far as possible from the sick man; the stone\r\nfinds out the sorcerer and returns to the doctor, who gives it to his\r\npatient and tells him it will cure him if he will wear it about his\r\nneck. This affords another illustration of the universal belief of the\r\nvalue of amulets in medicine.\r\n\r\nMedicine amongst certain tribes has a connection with the adoration\r\nof particular objects and animals believed to be related to each\r\nseparate stock or blood-kindred of human beings, and which is known in\r\nanthropology as totemism. The Algonquin Indians use the name, Bear,\r\nWolf, Tortoise, Deer, or Rabbit to designate each of a number of clans\r\ninto which the race is divided. The animal is considered as an ancestor\r\nor protector of the tribe.\r\n\r\nIn considering the institutions of “totemism” and “medicine,” we must\r\nnot forget that savage “medicine” has a function somewhat different\r\nfrom that of medicine in our sense of the word. Some doubt if there be\r\nany real distinction between the totem and the medicine.[75]\r\n\r\nSchoolcraft says that among the Sioux a clan consists of individuals\r\nwho use the same roots for medicine, and they are initiated into the\r\nclan by a great _medicine-dance_. The Sioux and other tribes make a\r\nbag out of the skin of the medicine (totem?) animal, which acts as a\r\ntalisman, and is inherited by the son. Here we have an instance of the\r\nreverence inspired by an inherited medicine. It is a little surprising\r\nthat we have so few evidences of the worship of healing herbs and drugs.\r\n\r\nDemon-worship is the explanation of the mysteries of Dionysus Zagreus\r\nand the Chthonic and Bacchic orgies. M. Reclus says: “If we knew\r\nnothing otherwise of these orgies, we could obtain a sufficiently\r\ncorrect idea of them by visiting the Ghâts, the Neilgherries, and the\r\nVindhyas.”[76]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  THE MEDICINE-DANCE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS.\r\n                                                   [_Face p._ 32.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n Bleeding.—Scarification.—Use of Medicinal Herbs amongst the Aborigines\r\n of Australia, South America, Africa, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Healing Craft of many of the northern tribes of Australia is thus\r\ndescribed by Mr. Palmer:—\r\n\r\n“Among the northern tribes many devices and charms are resorted to\r\nin the cases of pains and sickness. The doctors are men who, it is\r\nsupposed, possess great powers of healing, some of which they obtain\r\nfrom the spirits. They use stones and crystals to put away sickness\r\nfrom any one, and sometimes they bandage the afflicted part with\r\nstring tightly till no part of the skin is visible. One common plan of\r\nalleviating pain is by bleeding, supposing that the pain comes away\r\nwith the blood. For this minute cuts are made through the skin with\r\npieces of broken flint, or the edge of a broken mussel-shell, over\r\nthe part affected, and the blood is wiped off with a stick. Sometimes\r\nthe doctor ties a string from the sick place, say the chest, and rubs\r\nthe end of it across his gums, spitting into a kooliman of water, and\r\npassing the string through also; he then points to the blood in the\r\nwater as evidence of his skill in drawing it from the sick person.\r\nStones are sucked out with the mouth, and exhibited as having been\r\ntaken from the body. A good number of plants are used in sickness\r\nas drinks, and for external application. A broken arm is cured with\r\nsplints made of bark and wound round tightly. Snake-bite is cured by\r\nscarifying and sucking the wound, and by then using a poultice of\r\nbox-bark, bruised and heated.”[77]\r\n\r\nMr. E. Palmer says that “the Australian aborigines possessed a\r\nconsiderable knowledge of indigenous plants, and their acquaintance\r\nwith natural history was very accurate. They could only have obtained\r\nthis knowledge by close observation and generations of experience.\r\nWith the extermination of the blacks this information has completely\r\ndied out, and it can only now be obtained in far-distant places like\r\nNorth Queensland, where the aborigines have not been killed off by\r\ncontact with civilization. They have much experience in the healing\r\nvirtues and properties of plants, as also of the kinds best suited\r\nfor poisoning fish.”[78] Great skill is exhibited by their mode of\r\npreparing plants by fire and water and other processes, before using\r\nthem as food; if partaken of in their natural state, many of them\r\nwould be very deleterious, if not actually poisonous. The _Dioscorea\r\nsativa_, or karro plant, has large tubers, which are first roasted,\r\nthen broken in water and strained or squeezed through fine bags made\r\nof fibre into long bark troughs, then the product is washed in many\r\nwaters, the sediment is well stirred while the water is poured in; by\r\nthis means the bitter principle is extracted, and a yellow fecula like\r\nhominy is produced. _Careya australis_ has a root which is used to\r\npoison fish, though its fruit is eaten uncooked by the natives. Manna\r\nis gathered from _Eucalyptus terminalis_. _Cymbidium caniculatum_ is\r\nused for dysentery and other bowel disorders. The nuts of the _Cycas\r\nmedia_ are very poisonous unless prepared by fire and water, and then\r\nthey can be used as food. The seeds of _Entada scandens_ are only fit\r\nfor eating after baking and pounding, as is the case with many other\r\nplants cleverly manipulated by the blacks. The leaves of _Ocimum\r\nsanctum_ are infused in water and drunk for sickness. A wash is made\r\nfrom the bruised bark of the gutta-percha tree, _Excæcaria parviflora_.\r\nThe leaves of _Loranthus quandong_, the mistletoe of the _Acacia\r\nhemalophylla_, are infused in water and drunk for fevers, ague, etc.;\r\nit is doubtful whether they have any virtue, but mistletoe was once a\r\nvery highly prized medicine in Europe, though now wholly obsolete. The\r\nleaves of _Melaleuca leucadendron_ are used in infusion for headache,\r\ncolds, and general sickness. The _melaleuca_ is the cajeput tree, and\r\ncajeput oil is undoubtedly a valuable medicine. Stillé says, “It is\r\nof marked utility in cases of nervous vomiting, nervous dysphagia,\r\ndyspnœa, and hiccup.”[79] Externally it is valuable in nervous headache\r\nand neuralgia.\r\n\r\nThe natives make great use medicinally of the various species of\r\neucalyptus. The leaves of _Eucalyptus tetradonta_ are made into a drink\r\nfor fevers and sickness with headache, etc. The _Eucalyptus globulus_\r\nrecently introduced into civilized medicine comes from Australia.\r\n_Plectranthus congestus_, _Pterocaulon glandulosus_, _Gnaphalium\r\nluteo-album_ (several of this species are used in European medicine in\r\nbronchitis and diarrhœa, and one of them is called “Life Everlasting”),\r\n_Heliotropium ovalifolium_, and _Moschosma polystachium_, are all used\r\nin the medical practice of these despised aborigines, and are probably\r\nquite as valuable as the majority of the herbs recommended in our old\r\nherbals and pharmacopœias.\r\n\r\nThe aborigines of the north-western provinces of South America have\r\nlong been famous for their extensive knowledge of the properties of\r\nmedicinal plants, and even now they possess secrets for which we may\r\nenvy them.[80]\r\n\r\nThe arrow-poison used by the Indians of the interior is made from a\r\nplant of the strychnos family. Those of the Pacific coast prepare a\r\npoison from the secretion exuding from the skin of a small frog; this\r\nby a certain process of decomposition they convert into a powerful\r\nblood-poison. It is said that when these tribes were preparing poisons\r\nfor use in time of war, it was their ancient practice to test their\r\nefficacy on the old women of the tribe, and not on the lower animals,\r\nexhibiting in this respect a superior knowledge of toxicology than\r\nis shown by those pharmacologists of our own day who test on animals\r\nthe drugs they propose administering to man. Mr. R. B. White, in his\r\nnotes on these aboriginal tribes, says that the Indians in the State\r\nof Antioquia were in the habit of poisoning the salt springs in the\r\ntime of the Spanish invasion; they covered the spring with branches of\r\na tree called the “Doncel,” which imparted such venomous properties to\r\nthe water that after a lapse of three hundred years it still retains\r\nits deadly properties; when animals now get at the water, as many as\r\nthree horses have been known to be killed in one night by drinking\r\nit.[81]\r\n\r\nThe study of the means of capturing fish by poisoning the water—a\r\npractice which is universal amongst savages—must have led to many\r\nobservations on the properties of poisonous plants. Some considerable\r\nknowledge of the risks and uses of various leaves and berries must have\r\nbeen acquired in this way. The people of Timor-laut intoxicate fish\r\nwith rice steeped in poisonous climbing plants.[82]\r\n\r\nThe aborigines of the River Darling, New South Wales, feed their very\r\nsick and weak patients upon blood drawn from the bodies of their male\r\nfriends. It is generally taken raw by the invalid, sometimes however it\r\nis slightly cooked by putting hot ashes in it.[83]\r\n\r\nThe practice is disgusting, but scarcely more so than one which was\r\nprescribed a few years ago by the great physicians of Paris, who\r\nordered their anæmic patients to drink hot blood from the slaughtered\r\noxen at the _abattoirs_. Mr. Bonney says that the aborigines referred\r\nto willingly bleed themselves till they are weak and faint to provide\r\nthe food they consider necessary for the sick person.\r\n\r\nThe acacias are very abundant in Australia, in India, and Africa. This\r\norder of plants produces gum arabic and gum Senegal. The Tasmanians use\r\nthe gum of _Acacia sophora_ as a food.\r\n\r\nThe eucalyptus or blue-gum tree grows on the hills of Tasmania and in\r\nVictoria on the mainland of Australia; it was introduced into Europe in\r\n1856, and has been very extensively used as a remedy for intermittent\r\nfever, influenza, and as a powerful disinfectant.\r\n\r\n“As in all similar cases,” says Stillé, “the discovery of its virtues\r\nwas accidental. It is alleged that more than forty years ago the crew\r\nof a French man-of-war, having lost a number of men with ‘pernicious\r\nfever,’ put into Botany Bay, where the remaining sick were treated with\r\neucalyptus, and rapidly recovered. It is also said that the virtues of\r\nthe tree were well known to the aboriginal inhabitants.”\r\n\r\nA good illustration of the ways in which the properties of plants have\r\nbeen discovered, and of the relation of poisonous to harmless herbs,\r\nmay be found in the practice of the American Indians in their use of\r\nthe _manioc_, a large shrub producing roots somewhat like parsnips.\r\nThey carefully extract the juice, which is a deadly poison, and\r\nthen grate the dried roots to a fine powder, which they afterwards\r\nconvert into the _cassava_ bread. How was this treatment of the root\r\ndiscovered? It was simply due to the fact that one species of the\r\nshrub is devoid of any poisonous property, and has only to be washed\r\nand may then be eaten with impunity. No doubt this non-poisonous root\r\nwas the first which was used for food; then when the supply ran short\r\nthey were driven by necessity to find out the way to use the almost\r\nidentical root of the poisonous variety, which when divested of its\r\njuice is even better for food than the harmless root. Probably this\r\nwas only discovered after many experiments and fatalities. “Necessity,\r\nthe mother of invention,” in this as in most other things, ultimately\r\ndirected the natives to the right way of dealing with this article of\r\ndiet.\r\n\r\nThe male fern is a very ancient remedy for tape-worm, and to the\r\npresent day physicians have found nothing so successful for removing\r\nthis parasite. The plant is indigenous to Canada, Mexico, South\r\nAmerica, India, Africa, and Europe. The negroes of South America have\r\nlong used worm-seed (_Chenopodium anthelminticum_) as a vermifuge for\r\nlumbricoid worms. The plant grows wild in the United States, and has\r\nbeen introduced into the Pharmacopœia as a remedy especially adapted\r\nfor the expulsion of the round-worms of children. Kousso (_Brayera\r\nanthelmintica_) has been employed from time immemorial in Abyssinia for\r\nthe expulsion of tape-worm. It has been introduced into the British\r\nPharmacopœia.\r\n\r\nSome tribes of the Upper Orinoco, Rio Negro, etc., have been known to\r\nsubsist for months on no other food than an edible earth, a kind of\r\nclay containing oxide of iron, and which is of a reddish-brown colour.\r\n\r\nM. Cortambert, at a meeting of the Geographical Society in 1862,\r\ndescribed this singular food, and said it seemed to be rather a stay\r\nfor the stomach than a nourishment. Some white people in Venezuela have\r\nimitated the earth-eaters, and do not despise balls of fat earth.[84]\r\n\r\nSavages require much larger doses of drugs than civilized people. Mr.\r\nBonney relates[85] that he usually gave the aborigines of New South\r\nWales half a pint or more of castor oil for a dose. Another man took\r\nthree drops of croton oil as an ordinary dose.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bentley in 1862-63 contributed to the _Pharmaceutical\r\nJournal_ a series of articles on New American Remedies which have been\r\nintroduced into medical practice in consequence of their reputation\r\namongst the Indians. Yellow-root (_Xanthorrhiza apiifolia_) has long\r\nbeen employed by the various tribes of North American Indians as a\r\ntonic, and may be compared to quassia or calumba root. It is included\r\nin the United States Pharmacopœia. Its active principle seems to be\r\n_berberine_.\r\n\r\nThe blue Cohosh plant (_Caulophyllum thalictroides_) has for ages been\r\nused by the aborigines of North America as a valuable remedy for female\r\ncomplaints. A tea of the root is employed amongst the Chippeway Indians\r\non Lake Superior as an aid to parturition. The earliest colonists\r\nobtained their knowledge of the virtues of the blue cohosh from the\r\nnatives, and it has for many years been a favourite diuretic remedy\r\nin the States. Its common names are pappoose-root, squaw-root, and\r\nblueberry-root. Its active principle is called _caulophyllin_.\r\n\r\nTwin-leaf (_Jeffersonia diphylla_) is a popular remedy in Ohio\r\nand other North American States in rheumatism. It is called\r\n_rheumatism-root_. In chemical composition it is similar to senega.\r\n\r\nBlood-root, or puccoon (_Sanguinaria canadensis_), has been used\r\nfor centuries by North American Indians as a medicine. It has been\r\nintroduced into the United States Pharmacopœia. It is an alterative,\r\nand is useful in certain forms of dyspepsia, bronchitis, croup, and\r\nasthma. Its physiological action, however, bears no relation to\r\nits medicinal uses (_Stillé and Maisch_). Its active principle is\r\n_sanguinarina_.\r\n\r\n_Sarracenia purpurea_, Indian cup, or side-saddle plant, is a native\r\nof North America, and much used by the Indians in dyspepsia, sick\r\nheadache, etc.\r\n\r\nThe valuable bitter stomachic and tonic calumba-root comes to us from\r\nthe forests of Eastern Africa, between Ibo and the Zambesi. Its\r\nAfrican name is _kalumb_; it depends for its therapeutic value on\r\nthe berberine which it contains, and which is found in several other\r\nplants. The natives of tropical Africa, the North American Indians,\r\nand the semi-barbarian tribes of Hindostan and China have all been\r\nimpressed with the medicinal value of berberine. Before quinine was\r\ncommonly used in medicine, this valuable drug was estimated most highly\r\nfor its very similar properties. There can be no doubt that it was\r\nintroduced into medicine by savages.\r\n\r\nJalap comes to us from Mexico. It was named from the city of Xalapa.\r\n\r\nCinchona bark was used by the savages of Peru long before it was\r\nintroduced into European medicine.\r\n\r\nGuaiacum, so valuable in chronic rheumatism, was introduced into\r\nEuropean medicine from the West India Islands and the northern coasts\r\nof South America.\r\n\r\nThe excellent and popular tonic, quassia-wood, reaches us from Jamaica.\r\n\r\nLogwood, a valuable astringent, largely used in diarrhœa, is a native\r\nof Campeachy and other parts of Central America, and grows in the West\r\nIndia Islands and India.\r\n\r\nCopaiba, an oleo-resin from the copaiva tree, comes from the West\r\nIndies and tropical parts of America, chiefly from the valley of the\r\nAmazon. It is one of our most valuable remedies in diseases of the\r\ngenito-urinary organs.\r\n\r\nTurkey corn, or Turkey pea (_Dicentra_, _Corydalis formosa_) grows\r\nin Canada and as far south as Kentucky. It has a reputation as a\r\ntonic, diuretic and alterative medicine, and is used in skin diseases,\r\nsyphilis, etc.\r\n\r\nThe negroes use the prickly ash, or toothache shrub (_Xanthoxylum\r\nfraxineum_), as a blood purifier, especially in the spring. It has long\r\nbeen officinal in the United States Pharmacopœia, and is considered\r\nhighly serviceable in chronic rheumatism.\r\n\r\nThe shrubby trefoil (_Ptelea trifoliata_) is a North American shrub,\r\nmuch valued in dyspepsia, and as a stimulant in the typhoid state. Its\r\nactive principle is _berberine_.\r\n\r\nThe above are merely a few examples taken at random of the valuable\r\nmedicinal plants used by savages and primitive peoples.\r\n\r\nThus, as might have been expected, the discovery of the Americas led to\r\nthe introduction of many new drugs into medical practice.\r\n\r\nSavages eat enormously.\r\n\r\nWrangel says each of the Yakuts ate in a day six times as many fish as\r\nhe could eat. Cochrane describes a five-year-old child of this race as\r\ndevouring three candles, several pounds of sour frozen butter, and a\r\nlarge piece of yellow soap, and adds: “I have repeatedly seen a Yakut,\r\nor a Yongohsi, devour forty pounds of meat in a day.”[86]\r\n\r\nYet the savage is less powerful than the civilized man. “He is unable,”\r\nsays Spencer, “to exert suddenly as great an amount of force, and he\r\nis unable to continue the expenditure of force for so long a time.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE SURGERY.\r\n\r\n Arrest of Bleeding.—The Indian as Surgeon.—Stretchers, Splints, and\r\n Flint Instruments.—Ovariotomy.—Brain Surgery.—Massage.—Trepanning.—The\r\n Cæsarean Operation.—Inoculation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimitive man, from the earliest ages, must have been a diligent\r\nstudent of medicine; it has indeed been wisely said that the first\r\nman was the first physician. That is to say, he must have been at\r\nleast as careful to avoid noxious things and select good ones as the\r\nbeasts, and, as in the lowest scale, he must have been able in some\r\ndegree to observe, reflect, and compare one thing with another, and\r\nso find out what hurt and what healed him, he would at once begin to\r\npractise the healing art, either that branch of it which is directed\r\ntowards maintaining the health or that of alleviating suffering. When\r\nhis fellow-men were sick and died, he would be led to wonder why they\r\nperished; and when other men stricken in like manner recovered, he\r\nwould speculate as to the causes of their cure. It is probable that at\r\nfirst little attention was paid to the loss of blood when an artery was\r\nsevered. Soon, however, it would be remarked that under such conditions\r\nthe man would faint, and perhaps die. In process of time it would be\r\nobserved that when the injured blood-vessel was by any means, natural\r\nor artificial, closed, the man quickly recovered. Then some one wiser\r\nthan the other would bind a strip of fibre or a piece of the skin of a\r\nbeast around the bleeding limb, and the hæmorrhage would cease, and the\r\noperator would gain credit and reward. He would then, naturally, give\r\nhimself airs, and pretend, in course of time, to some importance, and\r\nso become a healer by profession. It would soon be noticed that those\r\nwho, in the search for berries in the woods, ate of certain kinds,\r\nmore or less promptly died, and those who had abstained from their use\r\nsurvived. It would be understood that such berries must not be eaten.\r\nOr again, a man suffering from some pain in his stomach would eat of\r\na particular plant that seemed good for food, and his pain would be\r\nrelieved: it might be ages before primitive man would arrive at the\r\nconclusion that there was some connection between the pain and its\r\ndisappearance after eating of the plant in question; but in process of\r\ntime the two things would be associated, and everybody would use the\r\ncurative plant for the particular pain.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to suppose that many such things would happen, and we\r\nknow as a fact that they have so happened in numberless instances.\r\n\r\nProbably empirical medicine, in the most ancient times and amongst the\r\nmost savage tribes, had an armoury of weapons against pain and sickness\r\nnot greatly inferior to our own Materia Medica. The origin of the use\r\nof most of our valuable medicines cannot be discovered.\r\n\r\n“As no man can say who it was that first invented the use of clothes\r\nand houses against the inclemency of the weather, so also can no\r\ninvestigation point out the origin of medicine—mysterious as the\r\nsources of the Nile. There has never been a time when it was not.”[87]\r\n\r\nThe origin of surgery is probably much older than that of medicine, if\r\nby the term surgery we mean the application of herbs to wounds, either\r\nas bandages or on account of their healing properties, and the use of\r\nmedicinal baths the like. Mr. Gladstone, in an address to a society of\r\nherbalists, which was reported in the _Daily News_, 27th March, 1890,\r\nsaid that an accident which occurred to himself, when cutting down a\r\ntree, illustrated the very beginning of the healing art. He cut his\r\nfinger with the axe, and found that he had no handkerchief with him\r\nwith which to bind up the wound, so he took a leaf of the tree nearest\r\nto him, and fastened it round his injured finger. The bleeding stopped\r\nat once, and the wound, he declared, healed much more quickly and\r\nfavourably than previous injuries treated in a more scientific manner.\r\nThere is no doubt whatever that this is a good example of the primitive\r\nmanner of treating cuts and other flesh wounds. The cooling properties\r\nof leaves would be recognised by the most primitive peoples; and as\r\na cut or other wound, by the process of inflammation, at once begins\r\nto burn and throb, a cooling leaf would be the most natural thing\r\nto apply. Some leaves which possess styptic and resinous properties\r\nwould staunch bleeding very effectually, and the mere act of binding\r\nround the cut an application like a leaf would serve to draw together\r\nthe edges of the wound, and afford an antiseptic plaster of the most\r\nscientific nature. It was, in fact, by just such means that the\r\nvaluable styptic properties of the matico leaves were first discovered\r\nby Europeans.\r\n\r\nIf, in the depths of the forest, an Indian breaks his leg or arm\r\n(said Dr. Kingston in his address at the British Medical Association\r\nmeeting at Nottingham, 1892), splints of softest material are at once\r\nimprovised. Straight branches are cut, of uniform length and thickness.\r\nThese are lined with down-like moss, or scrapings or shavings of wood;\r\nor with fine twigs interlaid with leaves, if in summer; or with the\r\ncurled-up leaves of the evergreen cedar or hemlock, if in winter; and\r\nthe whole is surrounded with withes of willow or osier, or young birch.\r\nOccasionally it is the soft but sufficiently unyielding bark of the\r\npoplar or the bass-wood. Sometimes, when near the marshy margin of our\r\nlakes or rivers, the wounded limb is afforded support with wild hay or\r\nreeds of uniform length and thickness.\r\n\r\nTo carry a patient to his wigwam, or to an encampment, a stretcher is\r\nquickly made of four young saplings, interwoven at their upper ends,\r\nand on this elastic springy couch the injured man is borne away by his\r\ncompanions. When there are but two persons, and an accident happens to\r\none of them, two young trees of birch or beech or hickory are used.\r\nTheir tops are allowed to remain to aid in diminishing the jolting\r\ncaused by the inequalities of the ground. No London carriage-maker\r\never constructed a spring which could better accomplish the purpose.\r\nA couple of crossbars preserve the saplings in position, and the\r\nbark of the elm or birch, cut into broad bands, and joined to either\r\nside, forms an even bed. In this way an injured man is brought by his\r\ncompanion to a settlement, and often it has been found, on arrival,\r\nthat the fractured bones are firmly united, and the limb is whole\r\nagain. This is effected in less time than with the whites, for the\r\nreparative power of these children of the forest is remarkable. In\r\ntheir plenitude of health, osseous matter is poured out in large\r\nquantity, and firm union is soon effected.\r\n\r\nThe reparative power of the aborigines, when injured, is equalled by\r\nthe wonderful stoicism with which they bear injuries, and inflict\r\nupon themselves severest torture. They are accustomed to cut into\r\nabscesses with pointed flint; they light up a fire at a distance from\r\nthe affected part (our counter-irritation); they amputate limbs with\r\ntheir hunting-knives, checking the hæmorrhage with heated stones, as\r\nsurgeons were accustomed to do in Europe in the time of Ambroise Paré;\r\nand sometimes they amputate their own limbs with more _sang froid_\r\nthan many young surgeons will display when operating on others. The\r\nstumps of limbs amputated in this primitive manner are well formed, for\r\nneatness is the characteristic of all the Indian’s handiwork.\r\n\r\nThe aborigines are familiar with, and practise extensively, the use of\r\nwarm fomentations. In every tribe their old women are credited with\r\nthe possession of a knowledge of local bathing with hot water, and of\r\nmedicated decoctions. The herbs they use are known to a privileged few,\r\nand enhance the consideration in which their possessors are held.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish bath, in a simpler but not less effective form, is well\r\nknown to them. If one of their tribe suffers from fever, or from the\r\neffects of long exposure to cold, a steam bath is readily improvised.\r\nThe tent of deer-skin is tightly closed; the patient is placed in one\r\ncorner: heated stones are put near him, and on these water is poured\r\ntill the confined air is saturated with vapour. Any degree of heat\r\nand any degree of moisture can be obtained in this way. Europeans\r\noften avail themselves of this powerful sudatory when suffering from\r\nrheumatism.\r\n\r\nThe aborigines have their herbs—a few, not many. They have their\r\nemetics and laxatives, astringents and emollients—all of which are\r\nproffered to the suffering without fee or reward. The “Indian teas,”\r\n“Indian balsams,” and other Indian “cure-alls”—the virtues of which\r\nit sometimes takes columns of the daily journals to chronicle—are not\r\ntheirs. To the white man is left this species of deception.[88]\r\n\r\nMr. E. Palmer says that there is a tribe of Australian aborigines,\r\ncalled “Kalkadoona,” adjoining the Mygoodano tribe of the Cloncurry,\r\nwho practise certain surgical operations at their _Bora_ initiations of\r\nyouths. They operate on the urethra with flint knives. The same custom\r\ncan be traced from the Cloncurry River to the Great Australian Bight in\r\nthe south. The females are in some of the south-western tribes operated\r\non in some manner to prevent conception. It is supposed that the ovary\r\nis taken out, as in the operation of spaying.[89]\r\n\r\nSuch operations are sometimes performed with a mussel-shell.\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock says of the Society Islanders that “they had no\r\nknowledge of medicine as distinct from witchcraft; but some wonderful\r\nstories are told of their skill in surgery. I will give perhaps the\r\nmost extraordinary. ‘It is related,’ says Mr. Ellis, ‘although,’ he\r\nadds with perfect gravity, ‘I confess I can scarcely believe it, that\r\non some occasions, when the brain has been injured as well as the bone,\r\nthey have opened the skull, taken out the injured portion of the brain,\r\nand, having a pig ready, have killed it, taken out the pig’s brains,\r\nput them in the man’s head and covered them up.’”[90]\r\n\r\nMassage in one form or another has been practised from immemorial\r\nages by all nations. Captain Cook tells us, in his narrative of the\r\npeople of Otaheite, New Holland, and other parts of Oceania, that they\r\npractise massage in a way very similar to that which is employed by\r\nmore civilized nations. For the relief of muscular fatigue they resort\r\nto a process which they call toogi-toogi, or light percussion regularly\r\napplied for a long time. They also employ kneading and friction under\r\nthe names of Miti and Fota. African travellers inform us that the\r\nmedicine-men use these processes for the relief of injuries to the\r\njoints, fractures, and pain of the muscles. Our word shampooing is\r\nsaid to have been derived from the Hindu term chamboning. Dr. N. B.\r\nEmerson, in 1870, gave an account of the lomi-lomi of the Sandwich\r\nIslanders. He says that, “when footsore and weary in every muscle, so\r\nthat no position affords rest, and sleep cannot be obtained, these\r\nmanipulations relieve the stiffness and soothe to sleep, so that the\r\nunpleasant effects of excessive exercise are not felt the next day, but\r\nan unwonted suppleness of joint and muscle comes instead.”[91]\r\n\r\nWhen we receive a blow or strike our bodies against a hard substance,\r\nwe instinctively rub the affected part. This is one of the simplest\r\nand most effectual examples of natural surgery. When the emollient\r\nproperties of oil were discovered, rubbing with oil, or inunction, was\r\npractised. The use of oil for this purpose in the East is extremely\r\nancient. Amongst the Greeks there was a class of rubbers who anointed\r\nthe bodies of the athletes. The oil was very thoroughly rubbed in, so\r\nthat the pores of the skin were closed and the profuse perspiration\r\nthereby prevented. After the contest the athlete was subjected to\r\nmassage with oil, so as to restore the tone of the strained muscles.\r\nThese aliptae came to be recognised as a sort of medical trainers. A\r\nsimilar class of slaves attended their masters in the Roman baths, and\r\nthey were also possessed of a certain kind of medical knowledge.\r\n\r\nDiscussing the origin of the operation of trepanning, Sprengel says\r\nthat “nothing is more instructive, in the history of human knowledge,\r\nthan to go back to the origin, or the clumsy rough sketch of the\r\ndiscoveries to which man was conducted by accident or reflection,\r\nand to follow the successive improvements which his methods and his\r\ninstruments undergo.”[92] The name of the inventor of this operation\r\nis lost in the night of time. Hippocrates gives us the first account\r\nof trepanning in his treatise on Wounds of the Head. We know, however,\r\nthat it was performed long before his time. Dr. Handerson, the\r\ntranslator of Baas’ _History of Medicine_, says that human skulls of\r\nthe neolithic period have been discovered which bear evidences of\r\ntrepanning.[93]\r\n\r\nThe operation of cutting for the stone, like many other of the most\r\ndifficult operations of surgery, was for a long time given over to\r\nignorant persons who make a speciality of it. Sprengel attributes this\r\ninjurious custom to the ridiculous pride of the properly instructed\r\ndoctors, who disdained to undertake operations which could be\r\nsuccessfully performed by laymen.[94]\r\n\r\nThe Bafiotes, on the coast of South Guinea, practise cupping. They make\r\nincisions in the skin, and place horns over the wounds, and then suck\r\nout the air, withdrawing the blood by these means.[95]\r\n\r\n“Felkin saw a case of the Cæsarean operation in Central Africa\r\nperformed by a man. At one stroke an incision was made through both the\r\nabdominal walls and the uterus; the opening in the latter organ was\r\nthen enlarged, the hæmorrhage checked by the actual cautery, and the\r\nchild removed. While an assistant compressed the abdomen, the operator\r\nthen removed the placenta. The bleeding from the abdominal walls was\r\nthen checked. No sutures were placed in the walls of the uterus, but\r\nthe abdominal parietes were fastened together by seven figure-of-eight\r\nsutures, formed with polished iron needles and threads of bark. The\r\nwound was then dressed with a paste prepared from various roots, the\r\nwoman placed quietly upon her abdomen, in order to favour perfect\r\ndrainage, and the task of this African Spencer Wells was finished. It\r\nappears that the patient was first rendered half unconscious by banana\r\nwine. One hour after the operation the patient was doing well, and her\r\ntemperature never rose above 101° F., nor her pulse above 108. On the\r\neleventh day the wound was completely healed, and the woman apparently\r\nas well as usual.”[96]\r\n\r\nThe South Sea Islanders perform trepanning, and some Australian tribes\r\nperform ovariotomy.[97]\r\n\r\nThe missionary d’Entrecolles was the first to inform the Western world\r\nof the method of inoculation for the small-pox, which the Chinese have\r\nfollowed for many centuries.[98]\r\n\r\nIn many countries, and from the earliest times, says Sprengel,[99]\r\nit has been customary to inoculate children with small-pox, because\r\nexperience has shown that a disease thus provoked assumes a milder and\r\nmore benign form than the disease which comes naturally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSALITY OF THE USE OF INTOXICANTS.\r\n\r\n Egyptian Beer and Brandy.—Mexican Pulque.—Plant-worship.—Union\r\n with the Godhead by Alcohol.—Soma.—The Cow-religion.—Caxiri.—Murwa\r\n Beer.—Bacchic Rites.—Spiritual Exaltation by Wine.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest desires of human nature is the passion for some\r\nkind or another of alcoholic stimulants. Intoxicating liquors are made\r\nby savages in primeval forests, and travellers in all parts of the\r\nworld have found the natives conversant with the art of preparing some\r\nsort of stimulating liquor in the shape of beer, wine, or spirit. The\r\nancient Egyptians had their beer and brandy, the Mexicans their aloe\r\nbeer or pulque. Probably the art of preparing fermented drinks was in\r\neach nation discovered by accident. Berries soaked in water, set aside\r\nand forgotten, saccharine roots steeped in water and juices preserved\r\nfor future use, have probably taught primitive man everywhere to\r\nmanufacture stimulating beverages. The influence of alcoholic drinks\r\non the development of the human mind must have been very great. If\r\nprimitive man has learned so much from his dreams, what has he not\r\nlearned from the exaltation produced by medicinal plants and alcoholic\r\ninfusions? If the savage conceives the leaves of a tree waving in the\r\nbreeze to be influenced by a spirit, it is certain that a medicinal\r\nplant or a fermented liquor would be believed to be possessed by a\r\nbeneficent or evil principle or being. A poison would be possessed by a\r\ndemon, a healing plant by a good spirit, a stimulating liquor by a god.\r\nPlant-worship would on these principles be found amongst the earliest\r\nreligious practices of mankind, and so we find it, although not to the\r\nextent we might have expected.\r\n\r\nSome savage peoples worship plants and make offerings to the spirits\r\nwhich dwell in certain trees. It would seem that it is not the plant\r\nor tree itself which is thus venerated, but the ghost which makes\r\nit its dwelling. In classic times “the ivy was sacred to Osiris and\r\nBacchus, the pine to Neptune, herb mercury to Hermes, black hellebore\r\nto Melampus, centaury to Chiron, the laurel to Aloeus, the hyacinth to\r\nAjax, the squill to Epimenes,” etc.[100]\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer thinks that plant-worship arose from the connection\r\nbetween plants and the intoxication which they produce. It is very\r\nremarkable that almost all peoples of whom we have any knowledge\r\nproduce from the maceration of various vegetable substances some kind\r\nof intoxicating liquor, beer, wine, or spirit. As the excitement\r\nproduced by fainting, fever, hysteria, or insanity is ascribed amongst\r\nsavages and half-civilized peoples to a possessing spirit, so also is\r\nany exaltation of the mind, by whatever means produced, attributed to\r\na similar cause. Supernatural beings they consider may be swallowed in\r\nfood or drink, especially the latter.[101]\r\n\r\nVambery speaks of opium-eaters who intoxicated themselves with the\r\ndrug; that they might be nearer the beings they loved so well. The\r\nMandingoes think that intoxication brings them into relation with the\r\ngodhead. A Papuan Islander hearing about the Christian God said, “Then\r\nthis God is certainly in your arrack, for I never feel happier than\r\nwhen I have drunk plenty of it.”[102]\r\n\r\nAny one who reads the sacred books of the East for the first time,\r\nespecially the Vedic hymns, will be puzzled to say whether the _Soma_,\r\nwhich is referred to so often, is a deity or something to drink. If we\r\nturn up the word in the index volume of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_,\r\nwe are astonished to find such an entry as this: “Soma, a drink, in\r\nBrahminical ritual, iv. 205; as a deity, iv. 205; vii. 249.” The soma,\r\nspeaking scientifically, is an intoxicating liquor prepared from the\r\njuice of a kind of milk-weed, _Asclepias acida_, sometimes called\r\nthe moon-plant. In the _Rig-Veda_ and the _Zend Avesta_ (where it\r\nis called _Haoma_) it appears as a mighty god endowed with the most\r\nwonderful exhilarating properties. Herbert Spencer, in the chapter of\r\nthe _Sociology_ entitled “Plant-Worship,” gives some of the expressions\r\nused in the _Rig-Veda_ concerning this fermented soma-juice.\r\n\r\n“This [Soma] when drunk, stimulates my speech [or hymn]; this called\r\nforth the ardent thought.” (R.V. vi. 47, 3.)\r\n\r\n“The ruddy Soma, generating hymns, with the powers of a poet.” (R.V.\r\nix. 25, 5.)\r\n\r\n“We have drunk the Soma, we have become immortal, we have entered into\r\nlight, we have known the gods,” etc. (R.V. viii. 48, 3.)\r\n\r\n“The former [priests] having strewed the sacred grass, offered up a\r\nhymn to thee, O Soma, for great strength and food.” (R.V. lx. 110, 7.)\r\n\r\n“For through thee, O pure Soma, our wise forefathers of old performed\r\ntheir sacred rites.” (R.V. ix. 96, 11.)\r\n\r\n“Soma—do thou enter into us,” etc.\r\n\r\nDr. Muir calls Soma “the Indian Dionysus.”\r\n\r\nIn Peru tobacco “has been called the sacred herb.”\r\n\r\nMarkham says, “The Peruvians still look upon coca with feelings of\r\nsuperstitious veneration.” In the time of the Incas it was sacrificed\r\nto the sun. In North Mexico, Bancroft says that some of the natives\r\n“have a great veneration for the hidden virtues of poisonous plants,\r\nand believe that if they crush or destroy one, some harm will happen to\r\nthem.” “And at the present time,” says Mr. Spencer, “in the Philippine\r\nIslands, the ignatius bean, which contains strychnia and is used as\r\na medicine, is worn as an amulet and held capable of miracles.” The\r\nBabylonians seem to have held the palm-tree as sacred, doubtless\r\nbecause fermented palm-juice makes an intoxicating drink.\r\n\r\nThe Palal, the supreme pontiff of the cow-religion of the Toda people\r\nof the Neilgherries, is initiated with incantations, and the smearing\r\nof his body with the juice of a sacred shrub called the tude.[103]\r\n\r\nHe also drinks some of the extract mixed with water. He is purified by\r\nsoaking himself with the juice of this plant, and in a week has become\r\na god; he is the supreme being of the Todas. This transmutation is\r\nsuggestive of the sacred soma.[104]\r\n\r\nThe aborigines of the Amazon make an intoxicating drink from wild\r\nfruits, which they use at their dances and festivals.[105] The people\r\non the Rio Negro use a liquor called “xirac” for the same purpose.\r\nThe Brazilian Indians have their “caxiri,” which is the same thing;\r\nit is a beer made from mandiocca cakes. This mandiocca is chewed by\r\nthe old women, spat into a pan, and soaked in water till it ferments.\r\nThe Marghi people of North Africa have an intoxicating liquor called\r\n“Komil,” made of Guinea-corn, which Barth said tastes like bad beer,\r\nand is very confusing to the brain.[106]\r\n\r\nThe Apaches make an intoxicating liquor from cactus juice, or with\r\nboiled and fermented corn. Their drunkenness is a preparation for\r\nreligious acts.[107]\r\n\r\nThe Kolarians of Bengal believe that the flowers of the maowah tree\r\n(_Bassia latifolia_) will cure almost every kind of sickness. “Not a\r\ncot,” says Reclus,[108] “but distils a heady liquor from the petals;\r\nnot a Khond man who does not get royally drunk.”\r\n\r\nThe people of the Nepal Himalayas make a beer from half-fermented\r\nmillet, which they call _Murwa_; it is weak, but very refreshing.\r\nHooker says the millet-seed is moistened, and ferments for two days; it\r\nis then put into a vessel of wicker-work, lined with india-rubber gum\r\nto make it water tight; and boiling water is poured in it with a ladle\r\nof gourd, from a cauldron that stands all day over the fire. The fluid,\r\nwhen fresh, tasted like negus.[109]\r\n\r\nThe fermented juice of the cocoa-nut palm makes an intoxicating toddy,\r\nof which some birds in the forests round Bombay are as fond as are the\r\nnatives themselves.[110]\r\n\r\nThe natives of Tahiti made an intoxicating drink by chewing the fresh\r\nroot of the “ava,” a plant of the pepper tribe (_Piper methysticum_),\r\nlong before Europeans taught them to ferment the fruits of the country\r\nabout the year 1796. The chewed root was rinsed in water, and by\r\nfermentation a drowsy form of intoxicating liquor was produced of which\r\nthe natives were extremely fond. They now prefer gin and brandy. The\r\neffects of ava or kava intoxication are said to be somewhat similar to\r\nthose of opium. The Nukahivans drink kava as a remedy for phthisis; it\r\nwould seem to be of real value in bronchitis, as a chemical examination\r\nof the root shows it to contain an oleo-resin probably somewhat akin to\r\nbalsam of Peru or tolu. It is an ally of the matico, and in its nature\r\nand operation closely resembles cubeb and copaiba, which are used to\r\nproduce a constriction of the capillary vessels.\r\n\r\nCascarilla bark and other barks of the various species of croton, of\r\nthe Bahama and West India Islands, have valuable stimulant properties\r\nuniversally recognised in modern medicine. They are used in the\r\ntreatment of dyspepsia and as a mild tonic.\r\n\r\nThe Carib races were fully conversant with the valuable properties\r\nof these drugs; the native priests or doctors used the dried plants\r\nfor fumigations and in religious ceremonies; and curiously enough at\r\nthe present day cascarilla bark is one of the ingredients of incense.\r\nAn infusion of the leaves was used internally in Carib medicine, and\r\nthe dried bark was mixed with tobacco and smoked, as is often done in\r\ncivilized lands.\r\n\r\nAnacreontic poetry and Bacchic rites were merely intellectual\r\ndevelopments of sentiments which the savage feels and expresses in a\r\ncoarse animal way, just as the alderman’s sense of gratification and\r\nperfect contentment after a civic banquet is not altogether different\r\nin kind from that felt by a replete quadruped.\r\n\r\nAlcoholic intoxication must have produced in primitive man visions far\r\nsurpassing those of his pleasantest dreams, and his brain must have\r\nbeen filled with images, sometimes pleasant, sometimes horrible, of\r\na more pronounced character than those which visited him in sleep.\r\nAt such times would come some of the visitants from the world of\r\nimagination to the mind of primitive man which have had the most\r\nimportant influence on his intellectual development. The drinking\r\ncustoms of our working classes of the present day are in a great degree\r\nprompted by the longing which man in every condition has to escape for\r\na while from the squalid, material surroundings of daily life into the\r\nideal world of intellectual pleasures, however low these may often be.\r\n“A national love for strong drink,” says a competent authority,[111]\r\n“is a characteristic of the nobler and more energetic populations of\r\nthe world; it accompanies public and private enterprise, constancy of\r\npurpose, liberality of thought, and aptitude for war.” Tea, haschish,\r\nhops, alcohol, and tobacco stimulate in small doses and narcotise in\r\nlarger; there have been cases known of tea intoxication.[112]\r\n\r\nThe desire of escaping from self into an ideal world, a world of\r\nnovelty and pleasures unimaginable, had much to do with the festivals\r\nin Greece in honour of Dionysus; it was in some places considered\r\na crime to remain sober at the Dionysia; to be intoxicated on such\r\noccasions was to show one’s gratitude for the gift of wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMS CONNECTED WITH PREGNANCY AND CHILD-BEARING.\r\n\r\n The Couvade, its Prevalence in Savage and Civilized Lands.—Pregnant\r\n Women excluded from Kitchens.—The Deities of the Lying-in Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Tylor[113] gives the following account of the Carib couvade in the\r\nWest Indies from the work of Du Tertre:[114]—\r\n\r\n“When a child is born, the mother goes presently to her work, but the\r\nfather begins to complain, and takes to his hammock, and there he is\r\nvisited as though he were sick, and undergoes a course of dieting which\r\nwould cure of the gout the most replete of Frenchmen. How they can fast\r\nso much and not die of it,” continues the narrator, “is amazing to me,\r\nfor they sometimes pass the five first days without eating or drinking\r\nanything, then up to the tenth they drink _oüycou_, which has about as\r\nmuch nourishment in it as beer. These ten days passed, they begin to\r\neat cassava only, drinking _oüycou_, and abstaining from everything\r\nelse for the space of a whole month. During this time, however, they\r\nonly eat the inside of the cassava, so that what is left is like the\r\nrim of a hat when the block has been taken out, and all the cassava\r\nrims they keep for the feast at the end of forty days, hanging them\r\nup in the house with the cord. When the forty days are up they invite\r\ntheir relations and best friends, who being arrived, before they set\r\nto eating, hack the skin of this poor wretch with agouti-teeth, and\r\ndraw blood from all parts of his body in such sort that from being\r\nsick by pure imagination they often make a real patient of him. This\r\nis, however, so to speak, only the fish, for now comes the sauce they\r\nprepare for him; they take sixty or eighty large grains of pimento or\r\nIndian pepper, the strongest they can get, and after well washing it\r\nin water they wash with this peppery infusion the wounds and scars of\r\nthe poor fellow, who I believe suffers no less than if he were burnt\r\nalive; however, he must not utter a single word if he will not pass\r\nfor a coward and a wretch. This ceremony finished, they bring him back\r\nto his bed, where he remains some days more, and the rest go and make\r\ngood cheer in the house at his expense. Nor is this all; for through\r\nthe space of six whole months he eats neither birds nor fish, firmly\r\nbelieving that this would injure the child’s stomach, and that it would\r\nparticipate in the natural faults of the animals on which its father\r\nhad fed; for example, if the father ate turtle, the child would be deaf\r\nand have no brains like this animal, if he ate manati, the child would\r\nhave little round eyes like this creature, and so on with the rest. It\r\nseems that this very severe fasting is only for the first child, that\r\nfor the others being slight.”\r\n\r\nAmong the Arawaks of Surinam a father must kill no large game for some\r\ntime after his child is born. When a wife has borne a child, amongst\r\nthe Abipones, the husband is put to bed and well wrapped up and kept as\r\nthough he had had the child. Among the Land Dayaks of Borneo, after the\r\nbirth of his child the father is kept in seclusion indoors for several\r\ndays and dieted on rice and salt to prevent the child’s stomach from\r\nswelling. All this is due to a belief in a bodily union between father\r\nand child; different persons with these savages are not necessarily\r\nseparate beings.\r\n\r\nTylor says[115] that Venegas mentions the couvade among the Indians\r\nof California; Zuccheli in West Africa; Captain Van der Hart in\r\nBouro, in the Eastern Archipelago; and Marco Polo in Eastern Asia in\r\nthe thirteenth century. In Europe even in modern times it existed in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the Pyrenees. Strabo said,[116] that among the\r\nIberians of the North of Spain, the women, after the birth of a child,\r\ntend their husbands, putting them to bed instead of going themselves.\r\nAmong the Basques, says Michel, “in valleys whose population recalls\r\nin its usages the infancy of society, the women rise immediately\r\nafter childbirth and attend to the duties of the household, while the\r\nhusband goes to bed, taking the baby with him, and thus receives the\r\nneighbours’ compliments.” Diodorus Siculus mentions the same thing of\r\nthe Corsicans (v. 14). Hudibras says,[117]—\r\n\r\n    “For though Chineses go to bed\r\n    And lie in, in their ladies’ stead,\r\n    And, for the pains they took before,\r\n    Are nurs’d and pamper’d to do more.”\r\n\r\nOn this remarks Dr. Zachary Grey[118]:—\r\n\r\n“The Chinese men of quality, when their wives are brought to bed, are\r\nnursed and tended with as much care as women here, and are supplied\r\nwith the best strengthening and nourishing diet in order to qualify\r\nthem for future services.” This is the custom of the Brazilians, if we\r\nmay believe Masseus, who observes, “that women in travail are delivered\r\nwithout great difficulty, and presently go about their household\r\nbusiness: the husband in her stead keepeth his bed, is visited by his\r\nneighbours, hath his broths made him, and junkets sent to comfort him.”\r\n\r\n“Among the Iroquois, a mother who shrieks during her labour is\r\nforbidden to bear other children, and some of the South American\r\nIndians killed the children of the mothers who shrieked, from the\r\nbelief that they will grow up to be cowards.”[119]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the couvade is not to be traced to the father and mother,\r\nsays Starcke; it has to do simply with the well-being of the child. The\r\nfather’s powers of endurance, tested so severely as we have seen, are\r\nbelieved to be assured to the child.[120]\r\n\r\nMax Müller traces the origin of the couvade to the derision of friends\r\nof both sexes.\r\n\r\nDobrizhoffen says of the Abipones:[121] “They comply with this custom\r\nwith the greater care and readiness because they believe that the\r\nfather’s rest and abstinence have an extraordinary effect on the\r\nwell-being of new-born infants, and is, indeed, absolutely necessary\r\nfor them. For they are quite convinced that any unseemly act on the\r\nfather’s part would injuriously affect the child on account of the\r\nsympathetic tie which naturally subsists between them, so that in the\r\nevent of the child’s death the women all blame the self-indulgence of\r\nthe father, and find fault with this or that act.”\r\n\r\nBadaga nursing-women physic themselves with ashes and pieces of\r\nsweet-flag (_Acorus calamus_), an aromatic plant, with the idea of\r\ncommunicating medicinal properties to the milk. They also administer\r\nto the baby assafœtida and a certain sacred confection taken from the\r\nentrails of a bull and similar to the bezoar stones so celebrated in\r\nthe middle ages.[122]\r\n\r\nThe Badaga folk do not permit a pregnant woman to enter the room where\r\nthe provisions are kept and the fireplace stands; it would be feared\r\nthat her condition, her supposed uncleanness, might lessen the virtues\r\nof the fire or diminish the nutritious value of the food.[123]\r\n\r\nPliny says, “there is no limit to the marvellous powers attributed\r\nto females.”[124] At certain times, according to him, a woman can\r\nscare away hailstorms, whirlwinds, and lightnings, by going about in\r\nscanty costume. If she walk round a field of wheat at such times, the\r\ncaterpillars, worms, beetles, and other vermin will fall from the ears\r\nof corn. If she touch “young vines, they are irremediably injured, and\r\nboth rue and ivy, plants possessed of highly medicinal virtues, will\r\ndie instantly upon being touched by her.” Bees, he says, will forsake\r\ntheir hives if she touches them, linen boiling in a cauldron will turn\r\nblack, and the edge of a razor will become blunted. The bitumen that\r\nis found in Judæa will yield to nothing but this, and Tacitus says the\r\nsame thing. Marvellous to say, poisonous and injurious as Pliny and\r\nother writers, and even popular belief at the present day, consider\r\nthe catamenial fluid to be, a host of writers on medical and magical\r\nsubjects have attributed certain remedial properties to it. Pliny says\r\nit is useful, as a topical application, for gout, the bite of a mad dog\r\n(what has _not_ been recommended for this!), for tertian or quartan\r\nfevers and for epilepsy. Reduced to ashes and mixed with soot and wax,\r\nit is a cure for ulcers upon all kinds of beasts of burden; mixed in\r\nthe same way with oil of roses and applied to the forehead, it cured\r\nthe migraine of Roman ladies. Applied to the doorposts, it neutralises\r\nall the spells of the magicians—a set of men which even the credulous\r\nPliny characterizes as the most lying in existence.\r\n\r\nBoth savages and classical peoples had the same curious notions about\r\nthe touch of catamenial women. There may possibly be some foundation in\r\nbacteriology to account for them.\r\n\r\nSt. Augustine says:[125] “The woman in child-bed must have three gods\r\nto look to her after her deliverance, lest Sylvanus come in the night\r\nand torment her: in signification whereof, three men must go about the\r\nhouse in the night, and first strike the thresholds with an hatchet,\r\nthen with a pestle, and then sweep them with besoms, that by these\r\nsigns of worship they may keep Sylvanus out.”\r\n\r\nLying-in women in Germany in the seventeenth century were simply\r\ncrammed with food about every two hours, and they seem to have taken no\r\nharm from the practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK II.\r\n\r\n             _THE MEDICINE OF THE ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n Antiquity of Egyptian Civilization.—Surgical Bandaging.—Gods\r\n and Goddesses of Medicine.—Medical Specialists.—Egyptians\r\n claimed to have discovered the Healing Art.—Medicine largely\r\n Theurgic.—Magic and Sorcery forbidden to the Laity.—The\r\n Embalmers.—Anatomy.—Therapeutics.—Plants in use in Ancient\r\n Egypt.—Surgery and Chemistry.—Disease-demons.—Medical Papyri.—Great\r\n Skill of Egyptian Physicians.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as we are able to judge from the records of the past which\r\nrecent investigations have made familiar to us, the civilization of\r\nEgypt is the most ancient of which we have accurate knowledge. The\r\ncontending claims of India to a higher antiquity for its civilization\r\ncannot here be discussed, and for the purposes of this work the oldest\r\nplace in the civilization of the world must be assigned to Egypt.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that the first kingdom of Egypt existed eight\r\nthousand years back. The history of Egypt as we have it in her\r\nmonuments and records is far more trustworthy than the stories which\r\nthe Chinese and other ancient peoples tell of their past. Assyria,\r\nBabylonia, and Chaldæa have histories reaching back to the twilight\r\nof the ages; but for practical purposes we must content ourselves\r\nwith tracing the rise and progress of civilization as we decipher\r\nit on the banks of the Nile. So far as medicine and chemistry are\r\nconcerned, we shall discover abundant matter to interest us. We\r\nrequire no other proof than the mummies in our museums to convince us\r\nthat the Egyptians from the period at which those interesting objects\r\ndate must have possessed a very accurate knowledge of anatomy, of\r\npharmacy, and a skill in surgical bandaging very far surpassing that\r\npossessed now-a-days by even the most skilful professors of the art.\r\nDr. Granville says: “There is not a single form of bandage known to\r\nmodern surgery, of which far better and cleverer examples are not seen\r\nin the swathings of the Egyptian mummies. The strips of linen are found\r\nwithout one single joint, extending to 1000 yards in length.” It is\r\nsaid that there is not a fracture known to modern surgery which could\r\nnot have been successfully treated by the priest-physicians of ancient\r\nEgypt. The great divinities of Egypt were Isis and Osiris; the former\r\nwas the goddess of procreation and birth. As it was she who decreed\r\nlife and death, and decided the fate of men, it is not surprising to\r\nfind her the chief of the divinities of the healing art; she had proved\r\nher claims as the great chief of physicians by recalling to life her\r\nson Horus.\r\n\r\nThe Æsculapius of the Egyptians was Imhotep; he was the god of the\r\nsciences, and was the son of Ptah and Pakht. The gods of Egypt were\r\nworshipped in triads or trinities, and many of the great temples were\r\ndevoted to the worship of one or other of these trinities, that of\r\nMemphis consisted of Ptah, Pakht, and Imhotep. Thoth or Tauut was\r\nsimilar to Imhotep; he was the god of letters, and, as the deity of\r\nwisdom, he aids Horus against Set, the representative of physical evil.\r\nBy many writers he is considered to be the Egyptian Æsculapius. He\r\nhas some evident relationship to the Greek Hermes. “Thoth,” says Dr.\r\nBaas (_Hist. Med._, p. 14), “is supposed to have been the author of\r\nthe oldest Egyptian medical works, whose contents were first engraved\r\nupon pillars of stone. Subsequently collected into the book _Ambre_ or\r\n_Embre_ (a title based upon the initial words of this book, viz. ‘Ha\r\nem re em per em hru,’ _i.e._ ‘Here begins the book of the preparation\r\nof drugs for all parts of the human body’), they formed a part of the\r\nso-called ‘Hermetic Books,’ from whose prescriptions no physician might\r\ndeviate, unless he was willing to expose himself to punishment in case\r\nthe patient died. This punishment was threatened because the substance\r\nof the medical, as well as the religious works of the Egyptians—and\r\nthe science of the priests united in itself medicine, theology, and\r\nphilosophy—was given, according to their view, by the gods themselves,\r\nand a disregard of their prescriptions would be nothing less than\r\nsacrilege.” The Hermetic books, says Clement of Alexandria, were\r\nforty-two in number, of which six “of the pastophor” were medical. The\r\nfamous _Book of the Dead_ is supposed by Bunsen to have been one of the\r\nHermetic books. The papyrus of Ebers, believed by that Egyptologist to\r\ndate from the year 1500 B.C., is considered to have been of the number\r\nof the medical books of Hermes Trismegistus. The Papyrus Ebers is\r\npreserved in Leipsic, and, though at present only partially deciphered,\r\nabundantly shows the great advance already made at so distant a period\r\nas the fourth millennium before the Christian era in the arts of\r\nmedicine and surgery.\r\n\r\nOne of the authors mentioned in the papyrus is an oculist of Byblos in\r\nPhœnicia. This proves not only that there were specialists in diseases\r\nof the eye at that period, but that neighbouring nations contributed of\r\ntheir store of scientific knowledge to enrich that of the Egyptians.\r\n\r\nDr. Baas informs us that this papyrus describes “remedies for diseases\r\nof the stomach, the abdomen, and the urinary bladder; for the cure of\r\nswellings of the glands in the groin (buboes) and the ‘kehn-mite’; ‘the\r\nBook of the Eyes’; remedies for ulcers of the head, for greyness of the\r\nhair, and promotion of its growth; ointments to heal and strengthen the\r\nnerves; medicines to cure diseases of the tongue, to strengthen the\r\nteeth, to remove lice and fleas; remedies for the hearing and for the\r\norgans of smell; the preparation of the famous Kyphi; ‘The Secret Book\r\nof the Physician’ (the science of the movement of the heart, and the\r\nknowledge of the heart, according to the priestly physician Nebsuchet);\r\nprescriptions for the eyes according to the views of the priest Chui,\r\na Semite of Byblos; ‘Book of the Banishing of Pains,’ recipes for\r\nmouth-pills for women, to render the odour of the mouth agreeable; the\r\nvarious uses of the tequem tree, etc. The papyrus has marginal notes,\r\nlike _nefer_ (good), etc., which Lauth assigns to the year B.C. 1469—an\r\nevidence that its prescriptions had been tested in practice.”[126]\r\n\r\nOsiris (who would appear to be the same deity as Apis or Serapis)\r\nand the goddess Isis, who was his wife and sister, were held by the\r\nEgyptians to have been the inventors of the medical arts. A very\r\nancient inscription on a column says: “My father is Chronos, the\r\nyoungest of all the gods. I am the king Osiris, who has been through\r\nall the earth; even to the habitable lands of the Indies, to those\r\nwhich are under the Bear, even to the sources of the Danube, and\r\nbesides to the Ocean. I am the eldest son of Chronos, and the scion\r\nof a beautiful and noble race; I am the parent of the day, there is\r\nno part of the world where I have not been, and I have filled all the\r\nworld with my benefactions.” Another column has these words: “I am\r\nIsis, queen of all this country, who has been instructed by Thoth; no\r\none is able to unbind what I have bound; I am the eldest daughter of\r\nChronos, the youngest of the gods. I am the wife and the sister of King\r\nOsiris. It is I who first taught mankind the art of agriculture. I am\r\nthe mother of King Horus. It is I who shine in the dog-star. It is I\r\nwho built the city of Bubastis. Farewell, farewell, Egypt, where I have\r\nbeen reared.” It appears from these inscriptions that Isis and Osiris\r\nwere contemporary with Thoth or Hermes.\r\n\r\nDiodorus says that Isis was believed by the Egyptian priests to have\r\ninvented various medicines and to have been an expert practitioner of\r\nthe healing art, and that she was on this account raised to the ranks\r\nof the gods, where she still takes interest in the health of mankind.\r\nShe was supposed to indicate appropriate remedies for diseases in\r\ndreams, and such remedies were always efficacious, even in cases where\r\nphysicians had failed to do any good.\r\n\r\nThe inscription informs us that Osiris had filled the earth with his\r\nbenefactions. The Egyptian priests believed that Thoth was the inventor\r\nof the arts and sciences in general, and the king Osiris and the queen\r\nIsis invented those which were necessary to life. Isis therefore\r\ninvented agriculture, and Osiris is credited with having invented\r\nmedicine. Apis, who is evidently the same person as Osiris, is said by\r\nClement of Alexandria to have discovered medicine before Io went to\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nCyril of Alexandria says that Apis was the first to invent the art of\r\nmedicine, or who exercised it with more success than his predecessors,\r\nhaving been instructed by Æsculapius.[127]\r\n\r\nPlutarch says[128] that Apis and Osiris were, according to Egyptian\r\ntraditions, two names of one and the same person, and this is confirmed\r\nby Strabo and Theodoret. Others say that Serapis was a third name of\r\nOsiris, though some consider that Serapis was a name of Æsculapius.\r\n\r\nHorus, the son of Isis and Osiris, was the Egyptian sun-god, and was\r\nthe same as the Apollo of the Greeks. He was born with his finger on\r\nhis mouth, indicative of mystery and secrecy; and so, probably, was for\r\nthis reason connected with medicine. In the mystical works of Hermes\r\nTrismegistus, he plays an important part. Diodorus attributes to Horus\r\nthe invention of medicine. He says that Isis having found in the water\r\nher son Horus, who had been killed by the Titans, restored him to\r\nlife and made him immortal. Diodorus adds that he was the same god as\r\nApollo, and that he learned the arts of medicine and divination from\r\nhis mother, in consequence of which instruction he had been of great\r\nservice to mankind by his oracles and his remedies. It is difficult\r\nto see how on this account Horus can be considered as the inventor of\r\nmedicine, a title which was surely due to his mother.\r\n\r\nIn the judgment scene in the Book of the Dead on the papyrus of Ani we\r\nhave the god Thoth, under the symbol of the cynocephalus, or dog-headed\r\nape. Anubis examines the indicator of the Balance. Before Anubis stands\r\nDestiny, behind him are Fortune and the Goddess of Birth. Above Destiny\r\nis a symbol of the cradle. The human-headed bird is the soul of the\r\ndeceased. On the right of the scene, Thoth, the medicine-god and scribe\r\nof the gods (with the head of an ibis), notes the result of the trial.\r\nBehind Thoth is the monster Amemit, the devourer, with the head of\r\na crocodile, the middle parts of a lion, and the hind-quarters of a\r\nhippopotamus. Thoth pronounces judgment: “The heart of Ani is weighed,\r\nand his soul standeth in evidence thereof; his case is straight upon\r\nthe great Balance.” The gods reply, “Righteous and just is Osiris, Ani,\r\nthe triumphant.”[129]\r\n\r\nEusebius, Psellus, and others say that Hermes Trismegistus was a priest\r\nand philosopher who lived a little after the time of Moses. He taught\r\nthe Egyptians mathematics, theology, medicine, and geography. Of the\r\nforty-two most useful books of Hermes six treated of medicine, anatomy,\r\nand the cure of disease.[130]\r\n\r\nPliny says[131] that the Egyptians claimed the honour of having\r\ninvented the art of curing diseases. Wilkinson points out[132] that\r\n“the study of medicine and surgery appears to have commenced at a very\r\nearly period in Egypt, since Athothes, the second king of the country,\r\nis stated to have written upon the subject of anatomy, and the schools\r\nof Alexandria[133] continued till a late period to enjoy the reputation\r\nand display the skill they had inherited from their predecessors.\r\nHermes was said to have written six books on medicine, the first of\r\nwhich related to anatomy; and the various recipes known to have been\r\nbeneficial were recorded, with their peculiar cases, in the memoirs of\r\nphysic, inscribed among the laws, which were deposited in the principal\r\ntemple of the place, as at Memphis in that of Ptah, or Vulcan.” We are\r\ntold in Genesis l. 2 that “Joseph commanded his servants the physicians\r\nto embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.” It is not\r\nprobable that the embalmers were regular practising physicians. The\r\ndissectors of the human body were not held in honour amongst the\r\nEgyptians, and for sanitary reasons it is highly improbable that\r\ndoctors in attendance upon the sick would have engaged in this work;\r\nbut as the art of embalming demanded considerable anatomical knowledge,\r\nit is more likely that a class of men similar to our dissecting-room\r\nassistants at the medical schools and hospitals were employed for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe art of medicine in ancient Egypt consisted of two branches—the\r\nhigher, which was the theurgic part, and the lower, which was the art\r\nof the physician proper. The theurgic class devoted themselves to\r\nmagic, counteracting charms by prayers, and to the interpretation of\r\nthe dreams of the sick who had sought their aid in the temples. The\r\ninferior class were practitioners who simply used natural means in\r\ntheir profession as healers. Amongst the Egyptian Platonists, theurgy\r\nwas an imaginary science, which is thus described by Murdock: “it was\r\nsupposed to have been revealed to men by the gods themselves in very\r\nancient times, and to have been handed down by the priests; [it was]\r\nalso the ability, by means of certain acts, words, and symbols, to\r\nmove the gods to impart secrets which surpass the powers of reason to\r\nlay open the future.” The higher physicians were priest-magicians, the\r\nlower class were priests who were called Pastophori; as Isis and the\r\npriests were connected with the healing art, the Pastophori were highly\r\nesteemed for their medical skill apart from magic. These officials were\r\nso called from the fact that they had to bear, in the ceremonies in the\r\ntemples, the παστός, or sacred shawl, to raise it at appropriate times,\r\nand so discover the god in the adytum.[134]\r\n\r\nIt was their duty to study the last six of the Hermetic books, as it\r\nwas that of the higher grade to study the first thirty-six.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ebers explained to Dr. Puschmann[135] that the Pastophori\r\n“constituted a class of priests who held by no means so low a rank\r\nas is attributed to them in historical works. The doctors were bound\r\nto maintain a spiritual character, and allowed themselves therefore\r\nto rank with the Pastophori, although the higher priestly dignities\r\nprobably remained open to them. On the other hand, the Pastophori were\r\nby no means likewise doctors, as many think, but had as a body quite\r\nother functions, as their name indeed indicates. The relation of the\r\nPastophori to the doctors was doubtless the same as that of the scholar\r\nto the cleric in the Christian middle ages; all scholars did not belong\r\nto the clergy, but at the same time all clergymen might be considered\r\nscholars.”\r\n\r\nThe principle of authority was paramount in Egyptian medicine. So long\r\nas the doctor faithfully followed the instructions of the ancient\r\nexponents of his art, he could do as he liked with his patient; but if\r\nhe struck out a path for himself, and his patient unhappily died, he\r\nforfeited his own life. Diodorus Siculus leads us to suppose that the\r\nphysicians formed their diagnosis according to the position occupied\r\nby the patient in his bed. This is singularly like the method of\r\ndiagnosing diseases in use amongst the ancient Hindus. Medicine in\r\nEgypt, after all, was only an art; the absurd reverence for authority\r\nprevented any real progress. Kept back by these fixed regulations, its\r\nfreedom was restricted on every side; otherwise, with the unbounded\r\nfacility for making post-mortem examinations, Egyptian medicine would\r\nhave made immense advance.\r\n\r\nConcerning the specialism which prevailed amongst Egyptian doctors,\r\nHerodotus says: “The art of medicine is thus divided amongst them:\r\neach physician applies himself to one disease only, and not more. All\r\nplaces abound in physicians; some physicians are for the eyes, others\r\nfor the head, others for the teeth, others for the parts about the\r\nbelly, and others for internal disorders.”[136]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the teeth, it is interesting to observe that some of\r\nthe dental work found in opening mummies is equal to our own.\r\n\r\nSir J. Wilkinson says[137] that the embalmers were probably members\r\nof the medical profession as well as of the class of priests. Pliny\r\nstates that, during this process, certain examinations took place,\r\nwhich enabled them to study the disease of which the patient had died.\r\nThey appear to have been made in compliance with an order from the\r\ngovernment,[138] as he says the kings of Egypt had the bodies opened\r\nafter death to ascertain the nature of their diseases, by which means\r\nalone the remedy for phthisical complaints was discovered. Indeed,\r\nit is reasonable to suppose that a people so advanced as were the\r\nEgyptians in knowledge of all kinds, and whose medical art was so\r\nsystematically arranged that they had regulated it by some of the\r\nvery same laws followed by the most enlightened and skilful nations\r\nof the present day, would not have omitted so useful an inquiry, or\r\nhave failed to avail themselves of the means which the process adopted\r\nfor embalming the body placed at their disposal. And nothing can more\r\nclearly prove their advancement in the study of human diseases than\r\nthe fact of their assigning to each his own peculiar branch, under the\r\ndifferent heads of oculists, dentists, those who cured diseases in the\r\nhead, those who confined themselves to intestinal complaints, and those\r\nwho attended to secret and internal maladies. They must have possessed\r\nan intimate knowledge of drugs, to have enabled them to select those of\r\nan antiseptic character suitable for the preservation of the mummies.\r\nThat their practical knowledge of anatomy must have been considerable\r\nis proved by the skill with which they removed the more perishable\r\nparts of the body in the process of embalming. The embalmers, says\r\nEbers, were all enrolled in a guild which existed down to Roman times,\r\nas is shown in various Greek papyri.\r\n\r\nIn the wall-cases 30-33 in the upper floor of the second Egyptian room\r\nof the British Museum, there is a set of Canopic jars which held the\r\nintestines of the human body, which were always embalmed separately.\r\nThey were placed near the bier and were four in number, each one being\r\ndedicated to one of the four children of Horus, the genii of the dead.\r\nThe stomach and large intestines were dedicated to Amset, the smaller\r\nintestines to Hâpi, the lungs and heart to Tuamâvtef, and the liver\r\nand gall-bladder to Kebhsenuf. Poor people had to be content with mere\r\nmodels of these vases.[139]\r\n\r\nThe dissectors were the _paraschistes_, who cut open as much of the\r\nbody as the law permitted with an Ethiopian stone. As soon as one of\r\nthem had made the requisite incision he had to fly, pursued by those\r\npresent, who cursed him bitterly, and flung stones at him. It was\r\nconsidered hateful to inflict any wound on a human body; and however\r\nnecessary the act might be, the agent incurred the greatest odium.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian doctors knew very little of anatomy as a science; they\r\nwere, however, acquainted with the fact that the blood-vessels had\r\ntheir origin from the heart, and that the blood was distributed to the\r\nbody from that organ. There is an interesting treatise on the heart in\r\nthe Papyrus Ebers. In another medical papyrus we find the following\r\nanatomical details concerning the blood-vessels:—\r\n\r\n“The head of man has thirty-two vessels; they carry the breath to his\r\nheart; they give inspiration to all his members. There are two vessels\r\nto the breasts; they give warmth to the lungs—for healing them, one\r\nmust make a remedy of flour of fresh wheat, herb haka, and sycamore\r\n_teput_—make a decoction and let the patient drink it; she will be\r\nwell. There are two vessels to the legs. If any one has a disease of\r\nthe legs, if his arms are without strength, it is because the secret\r\nvessel of the leg has taken the malady,—a remedy must be made.... There\r\nare two vessels to the arms; if a man’s arm is suffering, if he has\r\npains in his fingers, say that this is a case of shooting pains....\r\nThere are two vessels of the occiput, two of the sinciput, two of the\r\ninterior, two of the eyelids, two of the nostrils, and two of the left\r\near. The breath of life enters by them. There are two vessels of the\r\nright ear; the breath enters by them.”\r\n\r\nIt is uncertain whether by the term vessels the Egyptians understand\r\nthe arteries, the veins, the nerves, or some imaginary conduits.[140]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians were zealous students of medicine; yet, as Dr.\r\nEbers tells us, they also thought that the efficacy of the treatment\r\nwas enhanced by magic formulæ. The prescriptions in the famous Ebers\r\nPapyrus are accompanied by forms of exorcism to be used at the same\r\ntime; “and yet many portions of this work,” says Ebers, “give evidence\r\nof the advanced knowledge of its authors.”[141]\r\n\r\nOrigen says[142] that the Egyptians believed there were thirty-six\r\ndemons, or thirty-six gods of the air, who shared amongst them the body\r\nof man, which is divided into as many parts. He adds that the Egyptians\r\nknew the names of those demons, and believed that if they invoked\r\nthe proper demon of the affected part they would be cured. Magic and\r\nsorcery were arts which were forbidden to the laity.\r\n\r\nMany magical rites and animistic customs connected with the Egyptian\r\nreligion closely resemble those which prevail over the whole continent\r\nof Africa. The basis of the Egyptian religion is supposed by some\r\nauthorities to be of a purely Nigritian character; on which has been\r\nsuperimposed certain elevated characteristics due to Asiatic settlers\r\nand conquerors. The worship of the negroes proper is simply fetishism\r\ncombined with tree and animal worship and a strong belief in sorcery.\r\n\r\nThe great and peculiar feature of Egyptian magic lay in the fact that\r\nits formulæ were intended to assimilate to the gods those who sought\r\nprotection from the evils of life. The incantation was not in the\r\nnature of a prayer. As M. Lenormant says:[143] “The virtue of the\r\nformulæ lay not in an invocation of the divine power, but in the fact\r\nof a man’s proclaiming himself such or such a god; and when he, in\r\npronouncing the incantation, called to his aid any one of the various\r\nmembers of the Egyptian Pantheon, it was as one of themselves that he\r\nhad a right to the assistance of his companions.” In the Harris Papyrus\r\nis a fragment of one of the magical tracts of the medicine-god Thoth,\r\nin which is an incantation for protection against crocodiles:—\r\n\r\n    “Do not be against me! I am Amen.\r\n    I am Anhur, the good guardian;\r\n    I am the great master of the sword.\r\n    Do not erect thyself! I am Month.\r\n    Do not try to surprise me! I am Set.\r\n    Do not raise thy two arms against me! I am Sothis.\r\n    Do not seize me! I am Sethu.”[144]\r\n\r\nDisease-demons recognised the power of the gods, and obeyed their\r\ncommands. An inscription on a monument of the time of Ramses XII. tells\r\nhow the Princess Bint-resh, sister of Queen Noferu-ra, was cured in a\r\nserious illness by the image of the god Khonsu being sent to her after\r\nthe “learned expert” Thut-emhib had failed to do her any good. When the\r\ngod appeared at her bedside, she was cured on the spot; the evil spirit\r\nof the disease acknowledged the superior power of Khonsu, and came out\r\nof her after making an appropriate speech.[145]\r\n\r\nIn the records of a trial about a harem conspiracy in the reign of\r\nRamses III., we learn that a house steward had used some improper\r\nenchantments. In some fragments of the Lee and Rollin Papyrus, we\r\nread: “Then he gave him a writing from the rolls of the books of\r\nRamses III., the great god, his lord. Then there came upon him a divine\r\nmagic, an enchantment for men. He reached [thereby?] to the side of\r\nthe women’s house, and into that other great and deep place. He formed\r\nfigures of wax, with the intention of having them carried in by the\r\nhand of the land-surveyor Adiroma, to alienate the mind of one of the\r\ngirls, and to bewitch others.... Now, however, he was brought to trial\r\non account of them, and there was found in them incitation to all kinds\r\nof wickedness, and all kinds of villainy which it was his intention to\r\ndo.... He had made some magic writings to ward off ill-luck; he had\r\nmade some gods of wax, and some human figures to paralyse the limbs\r\nof a man; and he had put these into the hand of Bokakamon without the\r\nsun-god Ra having permitted that he should accomplish this,” etc.[146]\r\n\r\nThe actual medicaments used in Egyptian medical practice were not\r\nconsidered effectual without combination with magical remedies. The\r\nprescription might contain nitre, or cedar chips, or deer horn, or it\r\nmight be an ointment or application of some herbs; but it would not be\r\nefficacious without some charm to deal with the spiritual mischief of\r\nthe case. In administering an emetic, for example, it was necessary\r\nto employ the following appeal to the evil spirit of the disorder:\r\n“Oh, demon, who art lodged in the stomach of M., son of N., thou\r\nwhose father is called Head-Smiter, whose name is Death, whose name\r\nis cursed for ever,” etc. It was not the natural remedy which called\r\nthe supernatural to its aid; but in cultivated Egypt, this combination\r\nwas due to the theurgic healer availing himself of natural remedies\r\nto assist his magic. Science was beginning to work for man’s benefit,\r\nbut could not yet afford to discard sentimental aids which, by calming\r\nthe mind of the sufferer, assisted its beneficent work. The different\r\nparts of the human body were confided to the protection of a special\r\ndivinity. A calendar of lucky and unlucky days was devised, by which\r\nit could be ascertained what was proper to be medically done, or left\r\nundone, at certain times. Barth, in his _Travels in Africa_, in the\r\nborder region of the desert, tells of a native doctor who followed such\r\na system. He used to treat his patients according to the days of the\r\nweek on which they came: one day was a calomel day, another was devoted\r\nto magnesia, and a third to tartar emetic; and everybody requiring\r\nmedicine had to take that appropriate to the day.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians distinguished between black and white magic. The learned\r\npriests practised the curative acts of magic; but it was held to be a\r\ngreat crime to use black magic whereby to injure men or assist unlawful\r\npassions.\r\n\r\nHomer sings the praises of the medicinal herbs of prolific Egypt, where\r\nPæon imparts to all the Pharian race his healing arts;[147] and in\r\nJeremiah,[148] the daughter of Egypt is told that “in vain” she shall\r\n“use _many medicines_,” for she shall not be cured.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians depended greatly upon clysters in the treatment\r\nof many diseases besides those of the intestines. They were composed of\r\na mixture of medicinal herbs, with milk, honey, sweet beer, salt, etc.\r\nThe use of clysters by the Egyptians was remarked by Pliny and Diodorus\r\nSiculus, and the invention was attributed by the former to the ibis,\r\nwho, with its long bill, performed the necessary operation.[149]\r\n\r\nThis absurd idea arose from a confusion between the hieroglyph for the\r\nibis, and the god Thoth, the name of each having the same sign.[150]\r\n\r\nA comparison of the prescriptions of the medical papyri with those of\r\nthe ancient Greek physicians, especially Galen and Dioscorides, shows\r\na considerable family likeness of the Greek system of therapeutics to\r\nthat of the Egyptians. Chabas particularizes the following facts:—Honey\r\nwas used in place of sugar in many recipes by Egyptians and Greeks.\r\nWine was mixed with honey, and human milk was administered in the\r\nform of clysters by Egyptians and by Galen and Dioscorides. The use\r\nof barley drink, palm wine, nitre, or sal ammoniac, incense as an\r\nexternal application, blood mixed with wine, urine as a liniment,\r\n_Lapis memphites_, and several other drugs is prescribed for the same\r\ndisorders and in the same manner in the land of the Pharaohs and in\r\nancient Greece.\r\n\r\nThe famous “Ebers Papyrus” was purchased in 1874 by Dr. Ebers, at\r\nThebes. “This papyrus contains one hundred and ten pages, each page\r\nconsisting of about twenty-two lines of bold hieratic writing. It may\r\nbe described as an Encyclopædia of Medicine, as known and practised by\r\nthe Egyptians of the eighteenth dynasty; and it contains prescriptions\r\nfor all kinds of diseases—some borrowed from Syrian medical lore, and\r\nsome of such great antiquity that they are ascribed to the mythologic\r\nages, when the gods yet reigned personally upon earth. Among others,\r\nwe are given the recipe for an application whereby Osiris cured Ra\r\nof the headache.”[151] This is the oldest of all the medical papyri\r\nhitherto discovered. It comes down to us, says Dr. Ebers,[152] from the\r\neighteenth dynasty. The “Medical Papyrus” of Berlin is second in point\r\nof antiquity; and a Hieratic MS. in London, the third.[153]\r\n\r\nIn the Ebers Medical Papyrus is an example of old Egyptian diagnosis\r\nand therapeutics: “When thou findest any one with a hardness in his\r\n_re-het_ (pit of the stomach), and when after eating he feels a\r\npressure in his intestines, his stomach (_het_) is swollen, and he\r\nfeels bad in walking, like one who suffers from heat in his back;\r\nthen observe him when he lies stretched out, and if thou findest his\r\nintestines hot, and a hardness in his _re-het_, say to thyself, this is\r\na disease of the liver. Then prepare for thyself a remedy, according to\r\nthe secrets of the (botanical) science, from the plant _pa-che-test_\r\nand dates; mix them, and give in water” (Ebers).[154]\r\n\r\nThe famous medical papyrus roll in the Museum of Berlin is described by\r\nM. Chabas in the chapter on “The Medicine of the Ancient Egyptians,”\r\nin his work entitled _Mélanges Égyptologiques_. From this papyrus we\r\nlearn that plaisters, ointments, liniments, and friction were employed\r\nas external remedies. Many of the names of the herbs and medicaments\r\nemployed cannot be translated, but are merely transcribed. We find\r\na number of recipes for tumours of the breast, for pimples, for\r\n“dissipating divinely parts injured by bruises,” for destroying the\r\nbites of vermin, for cuts (common salt the chief ingredient), etc. The\r\nprescriptions seem very simple and brief.\r\n\r\nMagical invocations were frequently employed in the treatment of\r\ndisease. Chabas thinks that one of the maladies so treated was\r\nintestinal inflammation, with a feeling of heaviness, and hardness,\r\nand a griping pain. He translates the diagnosis of such a malady: “His\r\nbelly is heavy, the mouth of his heart (_os ventriculi_) is sick, his\r\nheart (his stomach) is burning, ... his clothes are heavy upon him.\r\nMany clothes do not warm him; he is thirsty at night; the taste of his\r\nheart is perverted, like a man who has eaten sycamore figs; his flesh\r\nis deadened as a man who finds himself sick; if he goes to stool, his\r\nbowels refuse to act. Pronounce on his case that he has a nest of\r\ninflammation in his belly; the taste of his heart is sick, ... if he\r\nraises himself, he is as a man who is unable to walk.” The text of the\r\npapyrus gives the remedies to be used in such a case. “Apply to him the\r\nmeans of curing inflammation by warmth; also the means of destroying\r\nthe inflammation in the belly.” The diagnosis and treatment here\r\ndescribed apply very well to what we term peritonitis; but Dr. Baas\r\nsuggests that gastric cancer may be indicated.\r\n\r\nThere is a medical papyrus in the Berlin Museum, which was discovered\r\nin the necropolis of Memphis, and which is described by Brugsch[155]\r\nas containing a quantity of recipes for the cure of many diseases,\r\nincluding some of the nature of leprosy. There is also what the great\r\nEgyptologists term “a simple, childish exposition of the construction\r\nand mechanism of the body. The writing explained the number and use of\r\nthe numerous ‘tubes.’” The origin of part of this work is traced to the\r\ntime of the fifth king of the table of Abydos, though the composition\r\nof the whole work is of the period of Ramses II. The text says of\r\nthe more ancient portion: “This is the beginning of the collection\r\nof recipes for curing leprosy. It was discovered in a very ancient\r\npapyrus, enclosed in a writing-case, under the feet (of a statue) of\r\nthe god Anubis, in the town of Sochem, at the time of the reign of his\r\nmajesty the defunct King Sapti. After his death, it was brought to the\r\nmajesty of the defunct King Senta, on account of its wonderful value.\r\nAnd, behold, the book was placed again at the feet, and well secured by\r\nthe scribe of the temple, and the great physician, the wise Noferhotep.\r\nAnd when this happened to the book at the going down of the sun, he\r\nconsecrated a meat, and drink, and incense offering to Isis, the lady;\r\nto Hor, of Athribis; and the god Khonsoo-Thut, of Amkhit.”\r\n\r\nHuman brains are prescribed for a disease of the eyes in the Ebers\r\nPapyrus. Pharmacy must have made considerable progress at the time this\r\nwork was written, as it contains two prescriptions for pills—one made\r\nwith honey for women, and one without it for men.\r\n\r\nChabas says that a severe discipline reigned in the schools of the\r\nancient Egyptians, and that the eloquence of the master was frequently\r\nsupplemented by the rod of his assistants. He gives in his translations\r\nof papyri one of the exhortations to a pupil.[156]\r\n\r\n“Oh, scribe,[157] give not thyself to idleness, or thou shalt be\r\nsmartly chastised; abandon not thy heart to pleasure, or thou wilt\r\nlet thy books slip out of thy hands; practise conversation; discuss\r\nwith those who are wiser than thyself; do the works of an elevated\r\nman. Yes, when thou shalt be advanced in years, thou wilt find this to\r\nbe profitable. A scribe, skilful in every kind of work, will become\r\npowerful. Neglect not thy books; do not take a dislike to them.”\r\n\r\nSir J. Gardner Wilkinson, in his _Manners and Customs of the\r\nEgyptians_, gives a list of plants (from Pliny) which were known to\r\nthe Egyptians and used in medicine or the arts. Ladanum (_Cistus\r\nladaniferus_) was introduced into Egypt by the Ptolemies. Myrobalanum\r\n(_Moringa aptera?_) produced a fruit from which an ointment was made.\r\nCypros (_Lawsonia spinosa et inermis_) was cooked in oil to make the\r\nointment called cyprus; the leaves were used to dye the hair. Elate\r\n(Abies?), palma or spathe was of use in ointments. Oil of bitter\r\nalmonds. Olives and figs were much esteemed. The castor-oil plant\r\n(_Ricinus communis_). A medicinal oil was extracted from what was\r\nprobably one of the nettle tribe (_Urtica pilulifera_). Tea (_Triticum\r\nzea?_), olyra (_Holcus sorghum?_), and tiphe (_Triticum spelta_), were\r\nused in decoctions; opium was extracted from _Papaver somniferum_.\r\n\r\nCnicus or atractylis (_Carthamum tinctorium?_) was a remedy against the\r\npoison of scorpions and other reptiles. Pliny says: “Homer attributes\r\nthe glory of herbs to Egypt. He mentions many given to Helen by the\r\nwife of the Egyptian king, particularly the Nepenthes, which caused\r\noblivion of sorrow.” Opium was well known to the ancients, as well\r\nas various preparations of that drug. Sir J. Wilkinson thinks that\r\nnepenthe was perhaps the _burt_ or _hasheesh_, a preparation of the\r\n_Cannabis sativa_ or Indian hemp.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians, says Ebers, thought that the kindly healing plants\r\nsprung up from the blood and tears of the gods.[158]\r\n\r\nUpon the ceilings and walls of the temples at Tentyra, Karnac, Luxor,\r\nand other places, basso-relievos have been discovered representing\r\nlimbs that have been amputated with instruments very similar to those\r\nwhich are employed in such operations in our own time. Such instruments\r\nare also found in the hieroglyphics, and Larrey says[159] that there\r\nare vestiges of other surgical operations which have been discovered\r\nin Egyptian ruins which abundantly prove that the art of surgery was\r\npractised with great skill in the land of the Pharaohs.\r\n\r\nMr. Flinders Petrie, excavating at the Pyramid of Medum, says of the\r\nskeletons he discovered there: “The mutilations and diseases that come\r\nto light are remarkable. One man had lost his left leg below the knee;\r\nanother had his hand cut off and put in the tomb; others seem to have\r\nhad bones excised, and placed separately with the body. In one case\r\nacute and chronic inflammation and rheumatism of the back had united\r\nmost of the vertebræ into a solid mass down the inner side. In another\r\ncase there had been a rickety curvature of the spine. To find so\r\nmany peculiarities in only about fifteen skeletons which I collected\r\nis strange. These are all in the Royal College of Surgeons now, for\r\nstudy.”[160]\r\n\r\n“Among the six hermetic books of medicine mentioned by Clement of\r\nAlexandria, was one devoted to surgical instruments; otherwise the very\r\nbadly set fractures found in some of the mummies do little honour to\r\nthe Egyptian surgeons” (Ebers).\r\n\r\nFlint instruments were always used for opening bodies, for circumcision\r\nand other surgical operations. How far this was dictated by religious\r\nrespect for antiquity, or by sanitary reasons, cannot be said;\r\nprobably, however, the reverence for the ancient flint knife had much\r\nto do with its retention.\r\n\r\nOur word chemistry is derived from the name of Egypt, _Khem_ or\r\n_Khemit_, the “Black Land,” meaning the rich, dark soil of the Nile\r\nvalley. The god Khem, also known as Min and Am, was the same as\r\nthe Pan of the Greeks and Priapus of the Romans. He presided over\r\nproductiveness and the kindly fruits of the earth. In this sense he was\r\nalso the god of curative herbs and simples, and so became associated\r\nin the popular mind with the arts of healing.[161] Thus we obtain the\r\nwords chemist, chemistry, and alchemy. Plutarch says that the Greek\r\nword χημία for Egypt, was bestowed on the land on account of the black\r\ncolour of its soil.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians must have had considerable practical knowledge of\r\nchemistry, or they could not have succeeded so well in the manufacture\r\nof glass, in dyeing, and the use of mordants, etc. Metallurgy must have\r\nbeen understood, as is evidenced by their process of gold manufactures\r\nrepresented in several of the royal tombs. They made gold wire, and\r\nexcelled in the art of gilding. Their methods of embalming also exhibit\r\nsome chemical knowledge. Dr. Pettigrew says,[162] his friend Professor\r\nReuvens, of Leyden, examined a papyrus which contained upwards of one\r\nhundred chemical and alchemical formulæ.\r\n\r\nIn the Ebers Papyrus there are several recipes for the preparation\r\nof hair dye. “The earliest of all the recipes preserved to us is a\r\nprescription for dyeing the hair.”[163]\r\n\r\nRecipes for exterminating vermin and noxious creatures are found in the\r\nsame work.\r\n\r\nIn anatomy, physiology, surgery, therapeutics, and chemistry it is\r\nevident that Egypt was far in advance of any other nation of the same\r\nperiod of which we have authentic accounts.\r\n\r\nThe Persian kings were glad to employ the Egyptian physicians, whose\r\nskill gained them high renown in the ancient world. Dr. Brugsch,\r\nin his account of the Egyptians in the Persian service, gives a\r\ntranslation of the inscriptions of Uza-hor-en-pi-ris, of the period\r\nof the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses. “O ye gods who are in Saïs!\r\nRemember all the good that has been done by the president of the\r\nphysicians, Uza-hor-en-pi-ris. In all that ye are willing to requite\r\nhim for all his benefits, establish for him a great name in this land\r\nfor ever. O Osiris! thou eternal one! The president of the physicians,\r\nUza-hor-en-pi-ris, throws his arms around thee, to guard thy image; do\r\nfor him all good according to what he has done, (as) the protector of\r\nthy shrine for ever.”[164] The last words addressed to Osiris refer\r\nto the form of the statue. The chief physician of Saïs is standing\r\nupright, with his hands embracing a shrine which holds the mummy of\r\nOsiris.\r\n\r\nWhether the ancient Greeks derived their knowledge of medicine from\r\nEgypt or from India has often been debated; the evidence seems to show\r\nthat Greece was indebted to India rather than to Egypt in this respect.\r\n\r\nMr. Flinders Petrie concludes “that Europe had an indigenous\r\ncivilization, as independent of Egypt and Babylonia as was the\r\nindigenous Aryan civilization of India; that this civilization has\r\nacquired arts independently, just as much as India has, and that Europe\r\nhas given to the East as much as it has borrowed from there.”[165]\r\n\r\nAmongst the Egyptian fellahs some curious observances, says Mr.\r\nFlinders Petrie, are connected with accidental deaths. “Fires of straw\r\nare lighted, one month after the death, around the ground where the\r\nbody has lain; and where blood has been shed, iron nails are driven\r\ninto the ground, and a mixture of lentils, salt, etc., is poured out.\r\nThese look like offerings to appease spirits, and the fires seem as if\r\nto drive away evil influences. Funeral offerings are still placed in\r\nthe tombs for the sustenance of the dead, just as they were thousands\r\nof years ago.”[166]\r\n\r\nModern Egyptians, like the ancient, wear written charms against\r\nsickness and disease. “Magical preparations of all sorts are frequently\r\nused as remedies in illness, and in even serious cases the patient is\r\nmade to swallow pieces of paper inscribed with texts from the Koran,\r\nand to try various similar absurd means, before a physician is applied\r\nto.”[167]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nJEWISH MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n The Jews indebted to Egypt for their Learning.—The only Ancient\r\n People who discarded Demonology.—They had no Magic of their\r\n own.—Phylacteries.—Circumcision.—Sanitary Laws.—Diseases in\r\n the Bible.—The Essenes.—Surgery in the Talmud.—Alexandrian\r\n Philosophy.—Jewish Services to Mediæval Medicine.—The Phœnicians.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat division of the Hebrew peoples which afterwards developed into\r\nIsrael, left its home in the extreme south of Palestine some fifteen\r\ncenturies before the Christian era to occupy the pasture lands of\r\nGoshen, in the territory of the Pharaohs, where they continued to\r\nretain their nomadic habits, their ancient language and patriarchal\r\ninstitutions. In process of time, however, the Egyptian sovereigns\r\nbegan to deal severely with their self-invited guests; they were forced\r\nto labour on the public works of Goshen; and though bitterly resenting\r\nthis attempt to destroy their identity and reduce them to mere slavery,\r\nthe proud and noble race was powerless to resist, and continued to\r\nlabour on in despair until a deliverer arose in Moses, who led them out\r\nof Egypt to the land of Palestine which they had originally left. Moses\r\nwas a pupil of the Egyptian priests, versed in all their wisdom, and\r\nimbued with the loftiest sentiments of the religion of Egypt. We shall\r\nexpect to find in the medicine of the Jews abundant traces of their\r\nlong residence in the land of the Pharaohs. Our sources for the history\r\nof the healing art and the theory of disease which obtained with the\r\npeople of Israel are two—the Bible and the Talmud. Therein we shall see\r\nthe influences, both external and internal, which made Jewish medicine\r\nwhat it was; and we shall be astonished, on comparing the theory of\r\ndisease with that of all the other nations and peoples of the earth, to\r\nfind that it stands by itself, is absolutely unique in its loftiness of\r\nidea, its absolute freedom from the absurd and degrading superstitions\r\nof the great and civilized nations amongst which they dwelt or by\r\nwhich they were surrounded. When we reflect on the religions of Egypt,\r\nAssyria, and Chaldæa, and compare their many gods with the one God of\r\nthe Jews, their demonology, sorcery, and witchcraft with the pure and\r\nelevated faith of these nomads of the Sinaitic Peninsula, and remember\r\nthat in all the earth at that time there was no other nation which\r\nhad formulated such a pure theism, no other people which had broken\r\naway from the degrading and corrupting demonology which possessed the\r\nwhole earth, we are compelled to recognise in God’s ancient people\r\nthe Jews the evidence of a teaching totally unlike anything which had\r\npreceded it. If the Bible, the Talmud, and the Koran are all three\r\nmerely specimens of ancient literature, how comes it that the Bible\r\nis so infinitely superior, not only in its noble monotheism, but in\r\nits remarkable freedom from so many of the superstitions which, as\r\nwe have seen, were everywhere intermixed with the noblest religious\r\nsystems and the most advanced civilizations? Magic in the Bible is\r\neverywhere passed by with contempt. Whatever may be the precise date of\r\nthe Psalms, they must have been written when all nations were sunk in\r\nthe grossest superstition, and had resort to magical practices on the\r\nslightest pretence; yet there is a total absence of all superstition in\r\nthe Psalms. Granting that the Book of Ecclesiastes is a mere piece of\r\ncynical philosophy, it contains no evidence of superstitious belief.\r\nThe more ancient is a literature, the greater is the certainty that it\r\nwill contain some reference to superstitious usages; yet how gloriously\r\nthe oldest books of the Bible shine in their freedom from contamination\r\nwith the demon-worship and conjuring arts of the nations surrounding\r\nthe children of Israel.\r\n\r\nAs the author of the learned article on “Medicine” in Smith’s\r\n_Dictionary of the Bible_ says: “But if we admit Egyptian learning as\r\nan ingredient, we should also notice how far exalted above it is the\r\nstandard of the whole Jewish legislative fabric, in its exemption from\r\nthe blemishes of sorcery and juggling pretences. The priest, who had\r\nto pronounce on the cure, used no means to advance it, and the whole\r\nregulations prescribed exclude the notion of trafficking in popular\r\nsuperstition. We have no occult practices reserved in the hands of\r\nthe sacred caste. It is God alone who doeth great things—working by\r\nthe wand of Moses or the brazen serpent; but the very mention of such\r\ninstruments is such as to expel all pretence of mysterious virtues in\r\nthe things themselves.” It is always God alone who is the healer: “I\r\nam the Lord that healeth thee” (Exod. xv. 26); “Heal me, O Lord, and I\r\nshall be healed” (Jer. xvii. 14); “For I will restore health unto thee,\r\nand I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord” (Jer. xxx. 17);\r\n“Who healeth all thy diseases” (Ps. ciii. 3); “He healeth the broken in\r\nheart, and bindeth up their wounds” (Ps. cxlvii. 3); “The Lord bindeth\r\nup the breach of His people, and healeth the stroke of their wound”\r\n(Isa. xxx. 26).\r\n\r\nThe priestly caste had no monopoly of the healing art; it might\r\nbe practised by any one who was competent to afford medical aid.\r\nPhysicians are mentioned in several passages.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Hebrews had no magic of their own, and notwithstanding\r\nthe stern severity with which it was prohibited in their law, there\r\nwould naturally be many who transgressed their law and imported the\r\nsuperstitious practices from the surrounding peoples.\r\n\r\nThe teraphim of Laban which were stolen by Rachel[168] is the earliest\r\nexample in the Bible of magical instruments. It seems that these\r\nobjects were a kind of idols in the shape of a human figure; their use\r\nwas condemned by the prophets, but they were for ages used in popular\r\nworship, both domestic and public. Hosea says:[169] “The children of\r\nIsrael shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and\r\nwithout a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and\r\n_without_ teraphim.” In this passage the teraphim and ephod are classed\r\nwith the sacrifice, as though equally essential for worship. Some\r\nstudents think that the teraphim were the Kabeiri gods;[170] whatever\r\nthey were, they were worshipped or used superstitiously by Micah, by\r\nthe Danites, and others.[171] They were used magically for the purpose\r\nof obtaining oracular answers, and were associated with the practice of\r\ndivination.[172]\r\n\r\nThe phylacteries of the Jews were charms or amulets in writing. They\r\nwere believed to avert all evils, but were especially useful in driving\r\naway demons. They put faith, also, in precious stones. To this day one\r\nmay see at the door of every Jewish house the mezûza—a scrap of sacred\r\nwriting—affixed diagonally on the right doorpost, enclosed in a metal\r\ncase. The texts contained are inscribed on parchment, and the words\r\nare from Deuteronomy vi. 4-9; xi. 13-21. In the Targum on Canticles\r\nviii. 3, we learn that the phylactery and mezûza were supposed to\r\nkeep off hurtful demons. This is merely the corruption of a perfectly\r\ninnocent idea; it is an example of the way in which harmless things\r\nbecome degraded to superstitious uses. The scapular of little squares\r\nof brown cloth worn by Catholics originally meant no more than the\r\ninvestiture, in a secret and unassuming manner, with the habit of the\r\nCarmelite order, and allowed pious persons living “in the world” to\r\nfeel that they were affiliated to a famous and saintly community. When\r\nthe Catholic wore it, he knew that he assumed the badge of the Blessed\r\nVirgin; there was no more in it than that. Amongst the ignorant and\r\nsuperstitious it is now commonly believed that the wearer is protected\r\nfrom death by fire and drowning, and that Our Lady will liberate him\r\nfrom purgatory on the first Saturday after his arrival there.\r\n\r\n“To the mind of the Israelite,” says Mr. Tylor, “death and pestilence\r\ntook the personal form of the destroying angel who smote the\r\ndoomed.”[173]\r\n\r\nGod is plainly declared, in Exodus xv. 26, to send diseases upon men\r\nas a punishment for the breach of His commandments, and this has been\r\nadduced to show that the Jews traced their maladies to the anger of\r\nan offended Deity; and thus it has been argued that their etiology\r\nof disease was not higher than that of the other nations. But this\r\nargument is unfair. The Mosaic law was to a great extent a sanitary\r\ncode, and even in the light of modern science we are compelled to\r\nadmire the wisdom of the laws which have for so many centuries made the\r\nJews the healthiest and most macrobiotic of peoples.\r\n\r\nThe rite of circumcision was not peculiar to the Jews; and just as\r\nbaptism was an initiatory rite borrowed from another religion, yet made\r\ndistinctive of Christianity, so circumcision has come to be considered\r\na peculiarly Jewish practice. It may have been with the Israelites a\r\nprotest against the phallus worship which is of such remote antiquity,\r\nand which was the foundation of the myth of Osiris. Wunderbar[174]\r\nasserts that it distinctly contributed to increase the fruitfulness\r\nof the race and to check inordinate desires in the individual. There\r\nare excellent surgical reasons for both these suppositions, in\r\naddition to which we may add that it contributed to cleanliness and\r\nprevented irritation. Wunderbar, moreover, seems to have established\r\nhis statement that after circumcision there is less probability of the\r\nabsorption of syphilitic virus, and he has instanced the fact that\r\nsuch specific disease is less frequent with Jewish than with Christian\r\npopulations.[175]\r\n\r\n“Circumcision,” says Pickering, speaking of the Polynesian practice,\r\n“was now explained; and various other customs, which had previously\r\nappeared unaccountable, were found to rest on physical causes, having\r\nbeen extended abroad by the process of imitation.”[176]\r\n\r\nThe same writer states that the practice is “common to the ancient\r\ninhabitants of the Thebaid, and also to the modern Abyssinians and\r\ntheir neighbours in the South.”[177]\r\n\r\nEwald[178] says that circumcision was practised by various Arabian\r\ntribes, in Africa, amongst Ethiopic Christians and the negroes of the\r\nCongo. It was also practised on girls by Lydian, Arabian, and African\r\ntribes, as Philo and Strabo inform us. Ewald considers it originated\r\nas an offering of one’s own flesh and blood in sacrifice to God, and\r\nmay have been considered as a substitute for the whole body of a human\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nCircumcision is practised amongst Australian savages on the Murray\r\nRiver, as also another incredible ceremonial, as Lubbock terms it.[179]\r\n\r\nCastration is hinted at in Matthew xix. 12 as an operation well\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nIn hot climates extra precautions for cleanliness have to be adopted\r\nbeyond those which would amply suffice in northern lands. Captain\r\nBurton says:[180]—\r\n\r\nHowever much the bath may be used, the body-pile and hair of the\r\narmpits, etc., if submitted to a microscope, will show more or less\r\nsordes adherent. The axilla hair is plucked, because if shaved the\r\ngrowing pile causes itching, and the depilatories are held to be\r\ndeleterious.\r\n\r\nSometimes Syrian incense or fir-gum, imported from Scio, is melted and\r\nallowed to cool in the form of a pledget. This is passed over the face,\r\nand all the down adhering to it is pulled up by the roots. He adds that\r\nmany Anglo-Indians adopt the same precautions.\r\n\r\nEwald, referring to the laws concerning women, says:[181] “The monthly\r\nperiod of the woman brought with it the second grade of uncleanness,\r\nwhich lasted the space of seven days, but without rendering necessary\r\nthe use of specially prepared water. Everything on which the woman sat\r\nor lay during this time, and every one who touched such things or her,\r\nincurred the uncleanness of the first grade.”\r\n\r\nWe find the demon-theory of disease in force in the time of Josephus.\r\nHe says:[182]—\r\n\r\n“Now within this place there grew a sort of rue, that deserves our\r\nwonder on account of its largeness, for it was no way inferior to any\r\nfig-tree whatsoever, either in height or in thickness; and the report\r\nis that it had lasted ever since the time of Herod, and would probably\r\nhave lasted much longer had it not been cut down by those Jews who\r\ntook possession of the place afterward; but still in that valley which\r\nencompasses the city on the north side, there is a certain place called\r\nBaaras, which produces a root of the same name with itself; its colour\r\nis like to that of flame, and towards evening it sends out a certain\r\nray like lightning; it is not easily taken by such as would do it, but\r\nrecedes from their hands; nor will yield itself to be taken quietly,\r\nuntil either οὖρον γυναικὸς ἢ τὸ ἔμμηνον αἵμα be poured upon it; nay,\r\neven then it is certain death to those that touch it, unless any one\r\ntake and hang the root itself down from his hand, and so carry it away.\r\nIt may also be taken another way, without danger, which is this: they\r\ndig a trench quite round about it, till the hidden part of the root be\r\nvery small; they then tie a dog to it, and when the dog tries hard to\r\nfollow him that tied him, this root is easily plucked up, but the dog\r\ndies immediately, as if it were instead of the man that would take the\r\nplant away; nor after this need any one be afraid of taking it into\r\ntheir hands. Yet, after all this pains in getting, it is only valuable\r\non account of one virtue it hath—that if it be only brought to sick\r\npersons, it quickly drives away those called Demons, which are no other\r\nthan the spirits of the wicked, that enter into men that are alive and\r\nkill them, unless they can obtain some help against them.”\r\n\r\nIf we may consider Josephus as a fair type of the learned and liberally\r\neducated men of his time, we are compelled to admit that the theory\r\nof disease held by the Hebrews of the period was not much, if at all,\r\nin advance of the rest of the world. It was undoubtedly largely the\r\ndemoniacal theory of sickness. In the _Antiquities of the Jews_[183]\r\nJosephus, in his description of the sagacity and wisdom of Solomon,\r\nsays: “God also enabled him to learn the skill that expels demons,\r\nwhich is a science useful and sanative to men. He composed such\r\nincantations also by which distempers are alleviated. And he left\r\nbehind him the manner of using exorcisms, by which they drive away\r\ndemons so that they never return; and this method of cure is of great\r\nforce unto this day; for I have seen a certain man of my own country,\r\nwhose name was Eleazar, releasing people that were demoniacal.” He goes\r\non to describe the process of extracting the demon from the sick man\r\nthrough his nostrils.\r\n\r\nSo again, in telling the story of Saul’s possession by the evil spirit\r\nfrom the Lord, he says:[184] “The physicians could find no other remedy\r\nbut this—that if any person could charm those passions by singing and\r\nplaying upon the harp, they advised them to inquire for such a one.” He\r\nseems to imply that David cured Saul by an incantation; and Spanheim,\r\ncommenting upon the story, says that the Greeks had such singers of\r\nhymns, and that usually children or youths were picked out for that\r\nservice, and that they were called singers to the harp.[185]\r\n\r\nWhether David merely influenced Saul in the natural and touching way so\r\nbeautifully described by Robert Browning in his poem “Saul,” we must\r\nbear in mind that an “incantation” was precisely of the character of\r\nthe Bible story, and that the demon theory of Saul’s malady is plainly\r\nstated.[186]\r\n\r\nHerzog[187] enumerates the following as the diseases of the Bible:—1.\r\n_Fever and ague_ (Lev. xxvi. 16). 2. _Dysentery_ (Acts xxviii. 8),\r\nwith, probably, _prolapsus ani_, as in Jehoram’s case (2 Chron. xxi.\r\n15, 19). 3. _Inflammation of the eyes_, due to heat, night dews,\r\nsea breeze, flying sand, injuries, etc. (Lev. xix. 14; Deut. xxvii.\r\n18; Matt. xii. 22, etc.). 4. _Congenital blindness_ (John ix. 1).\r\n5. _Disease of the liver_. 6. _Hypochondria_. 7. _Hysteria_. 8.\r\n_Rheumatism and gout_ (John v. 2, 3). 9. _Consumption_, a general term,\r\nincluding hectic, typhoid, and other fevers (Lev. xxvi. 16; Deut.\r\nxxviii. 22, etc.). 10. _Phthisis_ (?), indicated by leanness (Isa. x.\r\n16). 11. _Atrophy of muscles_, “withered hand,” being due either to\r\nrheumatism, plugging up of the main artery of the limb, or paralysis\r\nof the principal nerve, etc. (Matt. xii. 10; 1 Kings xiii. 4-6, etc.).\r\n12. _Fevers_ in general (Matt. viii. 14, etc.). 13. _Pestilence_\r\n(Deut. xxxii. 24). 14. _Oriental pest_, the so-called “bubonenpest,”\r\ncharacterised by swellings in the groins, armpits, etc.; a very fatal\r\ndisorder (Lev. xxvi. 25; Deut. xxviii. 21, 27, 60, etc.). 15. _Boils_\r\n(2 Kings xx. 7, etc.). 16. _Sunstroke_ (2 Kings iv. 19, etc.). 17.\r\n_Gonorrhœa_ (Lev. xv. 2). 18. _Metrorrhagia_, or uterine hemorrhage\r\n(Lev. xv. 25; Luke viii. 43, etc.). 19. _Sterility_ (Gen. xx. 18,\r\netc.). 20. _Asa’s foot disease_, either œdema or gout (2 Chron. xvi.\r\n12). 21. _Elephantiasis_ (?) (Job ii. 7). 22. _Dropsy_ (Luke xiv. 2).\r\n23. _Cancer_ (2 Tim. ii. 17). 24. _Worms_; may have been phthiriasis\r\n(lice) (2 Macc. ix. 5-9). 25. _Leprosy_. 26. _Itch_ and other skin\r\ndiseases (Deut xxviii. 27). 27. _Apoplexy_ (1 Sam. xxv. 37, etc.).\r\n28. _Lethargy_ (Gen. ii. 21; 1 Sam. xxvi. 12). 29. _Paralysis_, palsy\r\n(Matt. iv. 24; Acts iii. 2, etc.). 30. _Epilepsy_, the so-called\r\n“possession of devils” (Matt. iv. 24, etc.). 31. _Melancholia_, madness\r\n(Deut. xxviii. 28, etc.). 32. _Nervous exhaustion_ (1 Tim. v. 23). 33.\r\n_Miscarriage_ (Exod. xxi. 22). 34. “_Boils and blains_,” erysipelatous\r\n(Exod. ix. 9). 35. _Gangrene and mortification_ (2 Tim. ii. 17). 36.\r\n_Poisoning by arrows_ (Job vi. 4). _Poisoning from snake-bite_ (Deut.\r\nxxxii. 24). 37. _Scorpions and centipedes_ (Rev. ix. 5, 10). 38. _Old\r\nage_, as described in Eccles. xii. I am inclined to add to this list\r\n_Syphilis_, which seems to me to be clearly indicated by several verses\r\nin Proverbs xii., in the warnings against the strange woman, _e.g._\r\nverses 22, 23, 26, and 27.\r\n\r\nThe law forbade a Levite who was blind to act as a physician. Anatomy\r\nand pathology were not understood, as it was considered pollution even\r\nto touch the dead.\r\n\r\nThe surgical instruments of the Bible are the sharp stone or flint\r\nknives with which circumcision was performed, and the awl with which a\r\nservant’s ear was bored by his master (Exod. iv. 25; Josh. v. 2; Exod.\r\nxxi. 6). Roller bandages are referred to for fractures (Ezek. xxx. 21).\r\nJob used a scraper when he was smitten with boils (Job ii. 8). The\r\nmateria medica of the Bible is meagre. A poultice of figs—a favourite\r\nremedy in ancient times—is ordered in 2 Kings xx. 7.\r\n\r\nFish galls (Tobit xi. 4-13) and fasting saliva are used (Mark viii. 23).\r\n\r\nThe only regular prescription mentioned is that in Exodus xxx. 23-25.\r\n\r\nMidwives were regularly employed to assist Hebrew mothers.\r\n\r\nThe “bearing stool” was employed.\r\n\r\nThere is a very beautiful figurative description of the disease of old\r\nage or senile decay given by Solomon in the Book of Ecclesiastes:—\r\n\r\n“Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil\r\ndays come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have\r\nno pleasure in them; while the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the\r\nstars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: in the\r\nday when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men\r\nshall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and\r\nthose that look out of the windows be darkened, and the doors shall\r\nbe shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and\r\nhe shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of\r\nmusick shall be brought low; also _when_ they shall be afraid of _that\r\nwhich is_ high, and fears _shall be_ in the way, and the almond tree\r\nshall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall\r\nfail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about\r\nthe streets: or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be\r\nbroken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken\r\nat the cistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and\r\nthe spirit shall return unto God who gave it.”\r\n\r\nDr. Mead, in his treatise on the diseases of old age,[188] thus\r\nexplains the curious figurative phrases. By the darkening of the sun,\r\nmoon, and stars, he says we are to understand the obscuration of the\r\nmental faculties, which is so common in advanced life. The clouds\r\nreturning after rain symbolise the cares and troubles which oppress\r\nthe aged; especially when the vigour of the mind is lessened, so that\r\nthey cannot cast them off. From the mind we pass to the body: “the\r\nkeepers of the house shall tremble,” etc. That is to say, the limbs\r\nwhich support the body grow feeble and relaxed, and are incapable of\r\ndefending us against injuries. The grinders are the molar teeth. The\r\nfailing sight is compared to the darkness which meets those who look\r\nout of the windows. By diminished appetite the mouth, which is the\r\ndoor of the body, is less frequently opened than in youth. The sound\r\nof the grinding of the teeth is low, because old people have, in the\r\nabsence of them, to eat with their gums. The rising up at the voice\r\nof the bird signifies the short and interrupted sleep of the aged. By\r\nthe daughters of music we are to understand the ears, which no longer\r\nadminister to our pleasure in conveying harmonious sounds. The sense\r\nof feeling is diminished, and the aged are fearful of stumbling in the\r\nway. The early flowers of spring shall flourish in vain. The phrase,\r\nthe grasshopper shall become a burden, according to Dr. Mead, is the\r\nmodest Hebrew mode of describing the effects of scrotal rupture. He\r\nsays the grasshopper is made up chiefly of belly, and when full of eggs\r\nbears some resemblance to a scrotum smitten by a rupture. “Desire shall\r\nbe lost” is like Ovid’s _Turpe senilis amor_, and does not refer to\r\nappetite for food. The loosened silver cord is the vertebral column;\r\nthe medulla oblongata is of a silver or whitish colour. The golden\r\nbowl expresses the dignity of the head, from which in old age come\r\ndefluxions to the nose, eyes, and mouth. Incontinence of urine is a\r\ncommon trouble of the aged, well expressed by the figure of the pitcher\r\nbroken at the fountain; and the wheel at the cistern, to those who knew\r\nnothing of the circulation of the blood, fairly describes the failing\r\nheart, no longer capable of propelling the stream of life through the\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nReferring to the words, “The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the\r\nmoon by night” (Psalm cxxi. 6), Captain Burton says[189] that he has\r\nseen a hale and hearty Arab, after sitting an hour in the moonlight,\r\nlook like a man fresh from a sick-bed; and he knew an Englishman in\r\nIndia whose face was temporarily paralysed by sleeping with it exposed\r\nto the moon.\r\n\r\nThe captivity at Babylon brought the Jews into contact with a nobler\r\nand very high civilization. In many ways there is no doubt that Jewish\r\nthought was greatly developed and enlarged by association with the\r\npeoples of Babylonia and Assyria. What precise influences the Jews\r\nbecame subject to in this captivity we have not the means to determine;\r\nbut the fact that the Greek physician Democedes visited the court of\r\nDarius, proves that Eastern lands had in some measure fallen under\r\nthe influence of Greek thought, about the time of Ezra. The Book of\r\nEcclesiasticus is supposed to belong to the period of the Ptolemies,\r\nand in that work we find practitioners of medicine held in high\r\nesteem. “Honour a physician with the honour due unto him for the uses\r\nwhich ye may have of him; for the Lord hath created him.... The skill\r\nof the physician shall lift up his head; and in the sight of great men\r\nhe shall be in admiration. The Lord hath created medicines out of the\r\nearth; and he that is wise will not abhor them.... Then give place to\r\nthe physician, for the Lord hath created him; let him not go from thee,\r\nfor thou hast need of him.”[190]\r\n\r\nA very interesting but mysterious sect of the Jews was the ESSENES\r\n(B.C. 150). Our knowledge of this ancient community is chiefly derived\r\nfrom Josephus,[191] who says that they studied the ancient writers\r\nprincipally with regard to those things useful to the body and the\r\nsoul, that they thus acquired knowledge of remedies for diseases, and\r\nlearned the virtues of plants, stones, and metals. Another name for the\r\nEssenes was the Therapeutists, or the Healers.[192]\r\n\r\nThey lived somewhat after the fashion of monks, and had a novitiate of\r\nthree years. Some of their principles and rules suggest a connection\r\nwith Pythagorism and Zoroastrianism. De Quincey finds in Essenism\r\na saintly scheme of Ethics, a “Christianity before Christ, and\r\nconsequently without Christ.”[193] Recent scholarship, says Professor\r\nMasson, will not accept his conclusions concerning this remarkable\r\nsecret society.[194]\r\n\r\nThe surgery of the Talmud includes a knowledge of dislocations of the\r\nthigh, contusions of the head, perforation of the lungs and other\r\norgans, injuries of the spinal cord and trachea, and fractures of the\r\nribs. Polypus of the nose was considered to be a punishment for past\r\nsins. In sciatica the patient is advised to rub the hip sixty times\r\nwith meat-broth. Bleeding was performed by mechanics or barbers.\r\n\r\nThe pathology of the Talmud ascribes diseases to a constitutional vice,\r\nto evil influences acting on the body from without, or to the effect of\r\nmagic.\r\n\r\nJaundice is recognised as arising from retention of the bile,\r\ndropsy from suppression of the urine. The Talmudists divided dropsy\r\ninto anasarca, ascites, and tympanites. Rupture and atrophy of the\r\nkidneys were held to be always fatal. Hydatids of the liver were more\r\nfavourably considered. Suppuration of the spinal cord, induration of\r\nthe lungs, etc., are incurable. Dr. Baas[195] says that these are\r\n“views which may have been based on the dissection of [dead] animals,\r\nand may be considered the germs of pathological anatomy.” Some critical\r\nsymptoms are sweating, sneezing, defecation, and dreams, which promise\r\na favourable termination of the disease.\r\n\r\nNatural remedies, both external and internal, were employed. Magic\r\nwas also Talmudic. Dispensations were given by the Rabbis to permit\r\nsick persons to eat prohibited food. Onions were prescribed for worms;\r\nwine and pepper for stomach disorders; goat’s milk for difficulty of\r\nbreathing; emetics in nausea; a mixture of gum and alum for menorrhagia\r\n(not a bad prescription); a dog’s liver was ordered for the bite of a\r\nmad dog. Many drugs, such as assafœtida, are evidently adopted from\r\nGreek medicine. The dissection of the bodies of animals provided the\r\nTalmudists with their anatomy. It is, however, recorded that Rabbi\r\nIshmael, at the close of the first century, made a skeleton by boiling\r\nof the body of a prostitute. We find that dissection in the interests\r\nof science was permitted by the Talmud. The Rabbis counted 252 bones in\r\nthe human skeleton.\r\n\r\nIt was known that the spinal cord emerges from the foramen magnum, and\r\nterminates in the cauda equina. The anatomy of the uterus was well\r\nunderstood. A very curious point in their anatomy was the assumption of\r\nthe existence of a fabulous bone, called “Luz,” which they held to be\r\nthe nucleus of the resurrection of the body.[196]\r\n\r\n(The Arabians call this bone “Aldabaran.”)\r\n\r\nThey discovered that the removal of the spleen is not necessarily fatal.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Talmudists, the elementary bodies are earth, air,\r\nfire, and water. Pregnancy, they held, lasts 270 to 273 days (280 days\r\nis the modern calculation), and that it cannot be determined before the\r\nfourth month.\r\n\r\nAlexandrian philosophic thought received a new impulse in consequence\r\nof the conciliatory policy which the Ptolemies pursued towards the\r\nJews. Under Soter they were encouraged to settle in Alexandria, and\r\nsoon their numbers became very great. Egypt at one time contained\r\naltogether some 200,000 Jews. Alexandria became for several centuries\r\nthe centre of Jewish thought and learning. But the learning of the\r\nRabbis became a shallow pedantry in the course of time, and their\r\nfaith in the inspiration of their scriptures ultimately degenerated\r\ninto a Cabalism, which in its turn lent itself to jugglery and\r\nmagic-mongering, and infected the medicine of the Roman world, just as\r\nthe healing art had emancipated itself from superstition, theurgy, and\r\nphilosophical sophistries.\r\n\r\nKingsley has told us how this Jewish magic arose.[197] “If each word\r\n[of the Scriptures] had a mysterious value, why not each letter? And\r\nhow could they set limits to that mysterious value? Might not these\r\nwords, even rearrangements of the letters of them, be useful in\r\nprotecting them against the sorceries of the heathen, in driving away\r\nthese evil spirits, or evoking those good spirits who, though seldom\r\nmentioned in their early records, had, after their return from Babylon,\r\nbegun to form an important part of their unseen world?”\r\n\r\nJewish Cabalism formed itself into a system at Alexandria. It was\r\nthere, as Kingsley goes on to say, that the Jews learnt to become\r\nthe magic-mongers which Claudius had to expel from Rome as pests to\r\nrational and moral society.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Jewish doctors, three angels preside over the art of\r\nmedicine. Their names, according to Rabbi Elias, are Senoi, Sansenoi,\r\nand Sanmangelof.[198]\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages the Jews rendered the greatest services to the\r\nhealing art, and had a large share in the scientific work connected\r\nwith the Arab domination in Spain. The great names of MOSES MAIMONIDES\r\nand IBN EZRA attest the dignity of Jewish intellectual life in the Dark\r\nAges. The Golden Age of the modern Jews, as Milman[199] designates it,\r\nbegins with the Caliphs and ends with Maimonides. The Hebrew literature\r\nwas eminently acceptable to the kindred taste of the Saracens, and the\r\nsympathy between Arab and Jewish practitioners and students of medicine\r\nwas fraught with the greatest benefit to the healing art. The Golden\r\nAge of the Jews was at its height in the time of Charlemagne, when\r\nkings could not write their names. Their intelligence and education\r\nfitted them to become the physicians and the ministers of nobles and\r\nmonarchs. During the reign of Louis the Debonnaire the Jews were\r\nall-powerful at his court. His confidential adviser was the Jewish\r\nphysician Zedekiah, who was a profound adept in magic. In an age when\r\nmonkish historians could relate “with awe-struck sincerity,” as Milman\r\ndescribes it,[200] the tales of his swallowing a cartload of hay,\r\nhorses and all, it is not difficult to understand that an acquaintance\r\nwith the best knowledge of his time would account for the estimation\r\nin which a man of science was held. Maimonides lived at the court of\r\nthe Sultan of Egypt as the royal physician, in the highest estimation.\r\n\r\nThe Phœnicians were devoted to phallic-worship. The instrument of\r\nprocreative power was the chief symbol of their religion. Astarte was\r\ntheir great goddess. Baal-Zebub, the Beelzebub of the Bible, was their\r\ngod of medicine, and the arbiter of health and disease. The Cabiri,\r\nor Corybantes, considered by some authorities to be identical with\r\nthe Titans, by others with the sons of Noah, were considered as the\r\ndiscoverers of the properties of the medicinal herbs, and the teachers\r\nof the art of healing to mortals.[201]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE MEDICINE OF CHALDÆA, BABYLONIA, AND ASSYRIA.\r\n\r\n The Ancient Religion of Accadia akin to Shamanism.—Demon Theory of\r\n Disease in Chaldæan Medicine.—Chaldæan Magic.—Medical Ignorance of the\r\n Babylonians.—Assyrian Disease-Demons.—Charms.—Origin of the Sabbath.\r\n\r\n\r\nChaldæa was probably only second to Egypt in the antiquity of its\r\ncivilization. The founders of the Babylonian and Assyrian empires were\r\na Semitic tribe, and were the first people who worked in metals, and\r\ntheir knowledge of astronomy proves them to have been possessed of\r\nsome amount of scientific attainments. Their practice of medicine was\r\ninextricably mixed with conjurations of spirits, magic, and astrology.\r\n\r\nThe name now given to the primitive inhabitants of Babylon is\r\nAccadians. Sayce considers them to have been the earliest civilizers of\r\nEastern Asia. From the Accadians, he thinks the Assyrians, Phœnicians,\r\nand Greeks derived their knowledge of philosophy and the arts. Their\r\nlibraries existed seventeen centuries B.C.\r\n\r\nThe ancient religion of Accad was very similar to the Shamanism\r\nprofessed by Siberian and Samoyed tribes at the present time. There was\r\nbelieved to be a spirit in every object. Good or bad spirits swarmed\r\nin the world, and there was scarcely anything that could be done which\r\nmight not risk demoniacal possession. These good and bad spirits were\r\ncontrolled by priests and sorcerers. All diseases were caused by evil\r\nspirits, and the bulls and other creatures which guarded the entrance\r\nto houses were there to protect them from their power. The priests\r\nwere magicians. There were at one period of the development of the\r\nBabylonian mythology three hundred spirits of heaven and six hundred\r\nspirits of earth; the most dreadful of these latter were the “seven\r\nspirits,” who were born without father and mother, and brought plague\r\nand evil on the earth. Magic formulæ for warding off the attacks of\r\ndemons were commonly used, and charms and talismans were extensively\r\nemployed. The phylacteries of the Jews were talismans, and were of\r\nAccadian origin. The sorcerer bound his charm, “knotted with seven\r\nknots, round the limbs of the sick man, and this, with the further\r\napplication of holy water, would, it was believed, infallibly produce a\r\ncure; while the same result might be brought about by fixing a sentence\r\nout of a good book on the sufferer’s head as he lay in bed.”[202]\r\n\r\nAccadian literature, Mr. George Smith tells us, is rich in collections\r\nof charms and formulæ of exorcism belonging to the very earliest period\r\nof Babylonian history. There are magic formulæ of all kinds, some to\r\nward off sorcery, some to bewitch other persons.\r\n\r\nThe following is a specimen of the exorcisms used to drive away evil\r\nspirits, and to cure the diseases which were believed to be caused by\r\ntheir agency:—\r\n\r\n“The noxious god, the noxious spirit of the neck, the spirit of the\r\ndesert, the spirit of the mountain, the spirit of the sea, the spirit\r\nof the morass, the noxious cherub of the city, this noxious wind which\r\nseizes the body (and) the health of the body: O, spirit of heaven,\r\nremember! O, spirit of earth, remember!\r\n\r\n“The burning spirit of the neck which seizes the man, the burning\r\nspirit which seizes the man, the spirit which works evil, the creation\r\nof the evil spirit: O, spirit of heaven, remember! O, spirit of earth,\r\nremember!\r\n\r\n“Wasting, want of health, the evil spirit of the ulcer, spreading\r\nquinsey of the gullet, the violent ulcer, the noxious ulcer: O, spirit\r\nof heaven, remember! O, spirit of earth, remember!\r\n\r\n“Sickness of the entrails, sickness of the heart, the palpitation of a\r\nsick heart, sickness of bile, sickness of the head, noxious colic, the\r\n_agitation_ of terror, flatulency of the entrails, noxious illness,\r\nlingering sickness, nightmare: O, spirit of heaven, remember! O, spirit\r\nof earth, remember!”[203]\r\n\r\nIn the great magic collection of invocations copied by the order of\r\nAsurbanipal, we have a long litany on the “Spirit of Fever”; the lords\r\nand ladies of the earth, stars, the light of life, the spirit of Hurki\r\nand his talismanic ship, the spirit of Utu, umpire of the gods, and\r\nmany others are implored to “conjure it.”[204]\r\n\r\nProfessor Lenormant considers that the idea of punishment of sin by\r\nmeans of disease was a dogma of a later school of Chaldæan thought.\r\nThe old religion of spirits upon which Chaldæan magic was originally\r\nfounded was independently the doctrine of the priests of magic, so\r\nthat there were two sets of priests in later Chaldæan civilization—the\r\nold class who composed incantations to the spirits who fought with\r\nand replaced the disease-demons, and the theological priests who urged\r\nrepentance for sin as the only means of the cure of disease.[205]\r\n\r\nIn the Accadian philosophy there was in everything a dualism of\r\nspirits. Innumerable hosts of them caused all the phenomena of nature,\r\nfrom the movements of the stars to the life and death, the health\r\nand disease of every human being. This dualism was as marked as that\r\nof the religion of Zoroaster; everywhere and in everything the good\r\nspirits fought against the evil ones, discord prevailed throughout the\r\nuniverse; and on this conception rested the whole theory of sacred\r\nmagic. Man’s only help against the attacks of bad spirits, and the\r\nplagues and diseases which they brought upon him, lay in the invocation\r\nof good spirits by means of priests, sacred rites, talismans, and\r\ncharms. These could put to flight the demons by helping the good\r\nspirits in their constant warfare with them. Magic therefore became a\r\nsystem elaborated with scientific exactness, and a vast pantheon of\r\ngods became necessary. Hea was the great god of conjurational magic;\r\nhe was the supreme protector of men and of nature in the war between\r\ngood and evil. When neither word, nor rite, nor talisman, nor help\r\nof the other divinities of heaven availed to help mankind, Hea was\r\nall-powerful; and this was because, as Lenormant says,[206] Hea was\r\nalone acquainted with the awful power of the supreme name. “Before this\r\nname everything bows in heaven and in earth and in Hades, and it alone\r\ncan conquer the _Maskim_ (a species of evil demon), and stop their\r\nravages. The gods themselves are enthralled by this name, and render it\r\nobedience.”\r\n\r\nImages of demons were used by the Chaldæans as talismans against the\r\nattacks of demons. In a magical hymn to the sun against sorcery and\r\nwitchcraft, and their influence on the worshipper, the sun is reminded\r\nthat the images of the bad spirits have been shut up in heaps of corn.\r\nThe invocation concludes:—\r\n\r\n“May the great gods, who have created me, take my hand! Thou who curest\r\nmy face, direct my hand, direct it, lord, light of the universe,\r\nSun.”[207]\r\n\r\nIn a hymn composed for the cure of some disease, the priest, addressing\r\nthe god, speaks of the invalid in the third person:—\r\n\r\n    “As for me, the lord has sent me, the great lord, Hea, has sent me.———\r\n    Thou, at thy coming, cure the race of man, cause a ray of health to\r\n       shine upon him, cure his disease.\r\n    The man, son of his god, is burdened with the load of his omissions\r\n       and transgressions.\r\n    His feet and his hands suffer cruelly, he is painfully exhausted by\r\n       the disease.\r\n    Sun, at the raising of my hands, come at the call, eat his food,\r\n       absorb his victim, turn his weakness into strength.”[208]\r\n\r\nIn the “War of the Seven Wicked Spirits against the Moon,” we have an\r\nincantation which was destined to cure the king of a disease caused by\r\nthe wicked spirits.[209]\r\n\r\nIn the Chaldæan creed all diseases were the work of demons. This is\r\nwhy Herodotus found no physicians in Babylon and Assyria. There was\r\nno science of medicine; “it was simply a branch of magic, and was\r\npractised by incantations, exorcism, the use of philters and enchanted\r\ndrinks.”[210]\r\n\r\nOf course the priests made it their business to compound their drinks\r\nof such drugs as they had discovered to possess therapeutic virtue. In\r\nancient times magic and medicine were thus closely united. It could\r\nnot have been always faith alone which cured the patient, but faith\r\nplus a little poppy juice would work wonders in many cases. It became\r\ntherefore greatly to the interest of the priests and magicians to learn\r\nthe properties of herbs, and the value of the juices and extracts of\r\nplants. Out of evil, therefore, mankind reaped this great and valuable\r\nknowledge. The two gravest and most fatal diseases with which the\r\nChaldæans were acquainted, says M. Lenormant,[211] were the plague and\r\nfever, the _Namtar_ and the _Idpa_. Naturally they were represented as\r\ntwo demons, the strongest and most formidable who afflict mankind. An\r\nold fragment says:—\r\n\r\n  The execrable _Idpa_ acts upon the head of man,\r\n  The malevolent _Namtar_ upon the life of man,\r\n  The malevolent _Utug_ upon the forehead of man,\r\n  The malevolent _Alal_ upon the chest of man,\r\n  The malevolent _Gigim_ upon the bowels of man,\r\n  The malevolent _Telal_ upon the hand of man.[212]\r\n\r\nThe use of magic knots as a cure for diseases was firmly believed in by\r\nthe ancient Chaldees. M. Lenormant[213] gives a translation of one of\r\nthe formulæ supposed to have been used against diseases of the head.\r\n\r\n    Knot on the right and arrange flat in regular bands, on the left a\r\n        woman’s diadem;\r\n    divide it twice in seven little bands; ...\r\n    gird the head of the invalid with it;\r\n    gird the forehead of the invalid with it;\r\n    gird the seat of life with it;\r\n    gird his hands and his feet;\r\n    seat him on his bed;\r\n    pour on him enchanted waters.\r\n    Let the disease of his head be carried away into the heavens like\r\n        a violent wind; ...\r\n    may the earth swallow it up like passing waters!\r\n\r\nSir Henry Rawlinson has discovered that there were three classes\r\nof Chaldæan doctors, exactly in accordance with the enumeration of\r\nthe prophet Daniel. These were the _Khartumim_, or conjurors, the\r\n_Chakamim_, or physicians, and the _Asaphim_, or theosophists (see\r\nDaniel ii. 2; v. ii).\r\n\r\nThe Babylonian doctrine of disease was that the hosts of evil spirits\r\nin the air entered man’s body, and could only be expelled by the\r\nincantations of the exorcist. These disease-demons were addressed as\r\n“the noxious neck spirit,” “the burning spirit of the entrails which\r\ndevours the man.” Headache was caused by evil spirits which were\r\ncommanded by the charmer to fly away “like grasshoppers” into the\r\nsky.[214]\r\n\r\nHerodotus says of the Babylonians: “The following custom seems to me\r\nthe wisest of their institutions. They have no physicians, but when\r\na man is ill, they lay him in the public square, and the passers-by\r\ncome up to him, and if they have ever had his disease themselves, or\r\nhave known any one who has suffered from it, they give him advice,\r\nrecommending him to do whatever they found good in their own case, or\r\nin the case known to them; and no one is allowed to pass the sick man\r\nin silence without asking him what his ailment is.”[215]\r\n\r\nA Babylonian exorcism of disease-demons has been found in the following\r\nterms: the translation is by Prof. Sayce.[216]\r\n\r\n“On the sick man, by means of sacrifice, may perfect health shine like\r\nbronze; may the sun-god give this man life; may Merodach, the eldest\r\nson of the deep, give him strength, prosperity, and health; may the\r\nking of heaven preserve, may the king of earth preserve.”\r\n\r\nA curse against a sorcerer declares that “by written spells he shall\r\nnot be delivered.”\r\n\r\nThe elementary spirits were supposed to be seven baleful winds, which\r\nwere considered general causes of disease. One of the formulæ of\r\nexorcising these dreadful seven is translated by Mr. Smith from a great\r\ncollection of hymns to the gods which was compiled B.C. 2000.\r\n\r\n    “Seven (are) they, seven (are) they.\r\n    In the abyss of the deep seven (are) they.\r\n    In the brightness of heaven seven (are) they.\r\n    In the abyss of the deep in a palace (was) their growth.\r\n    Male they (are) not, female they (are) not.\r\n    Moreover the deep (is) their pathway.\r\n    Wife they have not, child is not born to them.\r\n    Law (and) kindness know they not.\r\n    Prayer and supplication hear they not.\r\n    (Among) the thorns of the mountain (was) their growth.\r\n    To Hea (the god of the sea) (are) they hostile.\r\n    The throne-bearers of the gods (are) they.\r\n    Disturbing the watercourse in the canal are they set.\r\n    Wicked (are) they, wicked (are) they.\r\n    Seven (are) they, seven (are) they, seven twice again are they.”[217]\r\n\r\nM. Lenormant gives a translation of a very long Accadian incantation\r\nagainst disease-demons; it is in the form of a litany, and each verse\r\nends with the words:—\r\n\r\n    “Spirit of the heavens, conjure it! Spirit of the earth, conjure it!”\r\n\r\nThere are some twenty-eight verses in all, and a great number of\r\ndiseases are mentioned. I have only space for a few of these.\r\n\r\n    “Ulcers which spread, malignant ulcers.”\r\n\r\n    “Disease of the bowels, the disease of the heart, the palpitation of\r\n        the diseased heart,\r\n    Disease of the vision, disease of the head,” etc.\r\n\r\n    “Painful fever, violent fever,\r\n    The fever which never leaves man,\r\n    Unremitting fever,\r\n    The lingering fever, malignant fever.\r\n    Spirit of the heavens, conjure it,” etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIn the Assyrian version it seems to be hinted that the expectoration\r\nof phthisical patients was as dangerous as our modern bacteriologists\r\ndeclare it to be, for we have these words:—\r\n\r\n  “The poisonous consumption which in the mouth malignantly ascends.”[218]\r\n\r\nIn the course of Layard’s excavations at Nineveh, a divining chamber\r\nwas discovered, at the entrance to which figures of the magi were\r\nfound. One of the orders of these magicians was the “Mecasphim,”\r\ntranslated by Jerome and the Greeks “enchanters,” such as used noxious\r\nherbs and drugs, the blood of victims, and the bones of the dead for\r\ntheir superstitious rites. Another class was the “Casdim,” who were a\r\nsort of philosophers, who were exempt from all employment except the\r\nduty of studying physic, astrology, the foretelling of future events,\r\nthe interpretation of dreams by augury, etc.[219]\r\n\r\nThe Assyrians had different demons for different diseases—some injured\r\nthe head, others attacked the hands and feet.[220]\r\n\r\nThe Assyrians believed that seven evil spirits might enter a man at the\r\nsame time; and there is a tablet which tells of the protection afforded\r\nby a god against such demons. When the deity stands at the sick man’s\r\nbedside, “those seven evil spirits he shall root out, and shall expel\r\nthem from his body, and those seven shall never return to the sick man\r\nagain.”[221]\r\n\r\n“Sometimes images of the gods were brought into the sick-room, and\r\nwritten texts from the holy books were put on the walls, and bound\r\nround the sick man’s brains. Holy texts were spread out on each side of\r\nthe threshold.”[222]\r\n\r\nIn Mr. George Smith’s _History of Assyria from the Monuments_, there\r\nis a translation of an Assyrian tablet from Assur-bani-pal’s library.\r\nThe tablet is on the charms to expel evil curses and spells. “It is\r\nsupposed in it,” says Mr. Smith, “that a man was under a curse, and\r\nMerodach, one of the gods, seeing him next to the god Hea, his father,\r\nenquired how to cure him. Hea, the god of wisdom, in answer related the\r\nceremonies and incantations for effecting his recovery, and these are\r\nrecorded in the tablet for the benefit of the faithful in after times.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION OF TABLET.\r\n\r\n   1.

Hea to his son Merodach answered\r\n  15. My son, thou knowest not how, I will recount to thee how to do it,\r\n  16. Merodach, thou knowest not how, I will reveal to thee how to do it,\r\n  17.

It is supposed that they were used by sick persons, who\r\ndrank their physic from them, trusting that it would thereby be more\r\nefficacious. As they drank they recited the formulæ and names of the\r\narchangels, Michael, Raphael, Ariel, Shaltiel, Malkiel, etc., which\r\nwere inscribed upon them. The catalogue says that the earliest of these\r\nbowls were made about B.C. 200. Many are from Tell-Ibrahim (Cutha). It\r\nmay be mentioned in this connection that Catholics frequently make the\r\nsign of the cross over medicinal potions before taking them.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Sabbath as a day of cessation from all labour is\r\nevidently Accadian. In the following translation of an Assyrian\r\ntablet[223] we find the Sabbatarian principle in full force.\r\n\r\n“The seventh day, feast of Merodach and Zir: Panibu, a great feast, a\r\nday of rest. The prince of the people will eat neither the flesh of\r\nbirds nor cooked fruits. He will not change his clothing. He will put\r\non no white robe. He will bring no offering. The king will not ascend\r\ninto his chariot. He will not perform his duties as royal law-giver.\r\nIn a garrison city the commander will permit no proclamations to his\r\nsoldiers. The art of the physician will not be practised.” This is\r\nanother proof that the Jews derived many of their religious customs\r\nfrom the Assyrians and Accadians. The Assyrian Sabbath was evidently\r\nobserved as strictly as under the Mosaic code. It is curious to note\r\nthat the physician was not permitted to exercise his merciful calling\r\non that day, and it throws light on the objection of the Jews to Christ\r\nthat it was not lawful to heal on the Sabbath-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE MEDICINE OF THE HINDUS.\r\n\r\n The Aryans.—Hindu Philosophy.—The Vedas.—The Shastres of Charaka and\r\n Susruta.—Code of Menu.—The Brahmans.—Medical Practitioners.—Strabo\r\n on the Hindu Philosophers.—Charms.—Buddhism and Medicine.—Jíwaka,\r\n Buddha’s Physician.—The Pulse.—Knowledge of Anatomy and Surgery in\r\n Ancient Times.—Surgical Instruments.—Decadence of Hindu Medical\r\n Science.—Goddesses of Disease.—Origin of Hospitals in India.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hindus are considered by Max Müller to be much older even as\r\nregards their civilization than the Egyptians. This belief is based on\r\nhis study of their language, which he says existed “before there was\r\na single Greek statue, a single Babylonian bull, or a single Egyptian\r\nsphinx.” According to him, the noble Indo-Germanic or Aryan people,\r\nfrom whom have descended the Brahman, the Rájput, and the Englishman,\r\nhad their earliest home, not in Hindustan, but in Central Asia. (Max\r\nMüller’s theory is now superseded by anthropological researches so far\r\nas the Europeans are concerned.) This splendid race drove before them\r\ninto the mountains or reduced to slavery the _Dasyus_, the obscure\r\naborigines, the non-Aryan primæval peoples. The earliest Aryan poets\r\ncomposed the _Rig-Veda_ at least three thousand, perhaps even four\r\nthousand years ago. The handsome Aryan fair-complexioned conquerors\r\nspoke with the utmost contempt of “the noseless” or “flat-nosed”\r\nMongolian aborigines, who, in the Vedic poems, from being “gross\r\nfeeders on flesh,” “lawless,” “non-sacrificing” tribes, were afterwards\r\ndescribed as “monsters” and “demons.”[224]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, if we wish to understand the principles of Hindu\r\nmedicine, to glance at the philosophy and religion of the Brahmans and\r\nBuddhists. The Aryan conquerors descending through the Himalayas were a\r\nsober, industrious, courageous people, who lived a pastoral life, and\r\nknowing nothing of the enervating attractions of great cities, required\r\nno other medical treatment than simple folk medicine everywhere\r\naffords. Their earliest literature is found in the “Vedic Hymns,” the\r\n“Sacred Books of the Hindus,” which were composed by the wisest and\r\nbest of the men, who were warriors and husbandmen, and the priests and\r\nphysicians of their own households. They gradually acquired priestly\r\nsupremacy over a wider range. Thus arose the Brahmans, the “Offerers of\r\nPotent Prayer.” The _Rig-Veda_ refers to physicians, and speaks of the\r\nhealing power of medicinal herbs; and the _Atharva-Veda_ contains an\r\ninvocation against the fever-demon, so that medical matters began very\r\nearly to receive attention after the conquest of India by the Aryans.\r\n\r\n“Hinduism,” says Professor Monier Williams, “is a creed which may be\r\nexpressed by the two words, spiritual pantheism.”[225] Of all beliefs\r\nthis is the simplest. Nothing really exists but the One Universal\r\nSpirit; man’s soul is identical with that Spirit. Separate existence\r\napart from the Supreme is mere illusion; consequently every man’s\r\nhighest aim should be to get rid for ever of doing, having, and being,\r\nand strive to consider himself a part of the One Spirit. This in a\r\nfew words is esoteric Hinduism. When we attempt to study the endless\r\nramifications of the exoteric, or popular belief, the system, so far\r\nfrom being simple, is infinitely complicated. God may amuse Himself by\r\nillusory appearances. Light in the rainbow is one, but it manifests\r\nitself variously. All material objects, and the gods, demons, good and\r\nevil spirits, men, and animals are emanations from the One Universal\r\nSpirit; though temporarily they exist apart from him, they will all\r\nultimately be reabsorbed into their source. In the Sanskrit language,\r\nwhich is the repository of _Veda_, or “knowledge,” we have the vehicle\r\nof Hindu philosophy. The systems of Hindu philosophy which grew out of\r\nthe third division of the _Vedas_, called the _Upanishads_, are six,\r\nand are given in Professor Monier Williams’ work already referred to as—\r\n\r\n  1. The Nyāya, founded by Gotama.\r\n  2. The Vais’eshika, by Kanāda.\r\n  3. The Sānkhya, by Kapila.\r\n  4. The Yoga, by Pantanjali.\r\n  5. The Mīmānsā, by Jaimini.\r\n  6. The Vedānta, by Bādarāyana or Vyāsa.\r\n\r\nWe know neither the dates of these systems, nor which of them preceded\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nOriental scholars tell us that, 500 years before Christ, in India,\r\nChina, Greece, and Persia men began to formulate philosophical systems\r\nof religious belief, and to elaborate scientific ideas of the world\r\nin which they lived. Williams considers the _Vais’eshika_ system of\r\nphilosophy the most interesting of all the systems, from the parallels\r\nit offers to European philosophical ideas. This system goes more\r\ncorrectly than the others into the qualities of all substances. It is\r\ntherefore more scientific, as we should say. It is most interesting to\r\ndiscover how nearly the doctrine of the atoms approaches our Western\r\nteaching. The following is Professor Williams’ account of these views:—\r\n\r\n“First, then, as to the formation of the world, this is supposed\r\nto be effected by the aggregation of _Anus_, or ‘Atoms.’ These are\r\ninnumerable and eternal, and are eternally aggregated, disintegrated,\r\nand re-integrated by the power of Adrishta. According to the Kanādas\r\nSūtras, an atom is ‘something existing, having no cause, eternal.’ They\r\nare, moreover, described as less than the least, invisible, intangible,\r\nindivisible, imperceptible by the senses, and as having each of them\r\na _Vis’esha_ or eternal essence of its own. The combination of these\r\natoms is first into an aggregate of two, called _Duy-anuka_. Three of\r\nthem, again, are supposed to combine into a _Trasa-renu_, which, like a\r\nmote in a sunbeam, has just magnitude enough to be perceptible.”[226]\r\n\r\nIn the Sānkhya philosophy we find something very like Darwinism. “There\r\ncannot be the production of something out of nothing; that which is not\r\ncannot be developed into that which is. The production of what does\r\nnot already exist (potentially) is impossible, like a horn on a man;\r\nbecause there must of necessity be a material out of which a product is\r\ndeveloped; and because everything cannot occur everywhere at all times;\r\nand because anything possible must be produced from something competent\r\nto produce it.” (_Aphorisms_, i. 78, 114-117).[227]\r\n\r\nThe _Upa-Vedas_, or secondary _Vedas_, treat of various sciences,\r\none of which, _Ayur-Veda_, is the “science of life,” or medicine. By\r\nsome this is considered to belong to the _Atharva-Veda_; by others\r\nto the _Rig-Veda_. By _Ayur-Veda_ we are to understand something\r\nderived immediately from the gods. The supplementary revelation known\r\nas _Upa-Vedas_ dates about 350 B.C., and there we find Brahmanical\r\nmedicine already developing.[228]\r\n\r\n“Of all ancient nations,” says Elphinstone, “the Egyptians are the one\r\nwhom the Hindus seem most to have resembled.”[229]\r\n\r\nThere is good reason for believing that the ancient Greeks derived much\r\nof their philosophy and religion from the Egyptians, who seem in their\r\nturn to have taken both in great measure from India. Says Elphinstone:\r\n“It is impossible not to be struck with the identity of the topics\r\ndiscussed by the Hindu philosophers with those which engaged the\r\nattention of the same class in ancient Greece, and with the similarity\r\nbetween the doctrines of schools subsisting in regions of the earth so\r\nremote from each other.”[230]\r\n\r\nHere we find the doctrines of the eternity of matter, the derivation\r\nof all souls from God and their return to Him, the doctrine of atoms\r\nand a whole system similar to that of Pythagoras. The Greek philosopher\r\ntaught that intermediate between God and mankind are a host of aerial\r\nbeings who exercise various influences on the condition of mankind\r\nand the affairs of the world. Enfield[231] and Stanley[232] say that\r\nPythagoras learned his doctrine from the Magi or Oriental philosophers.\r\n\r\nMax Müller says that Zarathustra and his followers, the Zoroastrians,\r\nhad been settled in India before they immigrated into Persia. “That the\r\nZoroastrians and their ancestors started from India during the Vaidik\r\nperiod, can be proved as distinctly as that the inhabitants of Massilia\r\nstarted from Greece.... Many of the gods of the Zoroastrians come out\r\n... as mere reflections and deflections of the primitive and authentic\r\ngods of _Veda_.”[233]\r\n\r\nThe Hindus say that when their four immortal Vedas, named Rig, Yajur,\r\nSáma, and Atharva, were originally given to man by Brahma, there was\r\nno disease or sin; but when mankind fell away from this virtuous and\r\nhappy state, life was shortened and disease introduced. Brahma, in his\r\ncompassion for the sufferings of mankind, then gave a second class of\r\nsacred books, the _Upavédas_; one of these, named _Ayur-Veda_, treats\r\nof the prevention and cure of diseases. Some say this work really came\r\nfrom Siva; it is the sacred medical authority of the Hindus, and is of\r\nthe highest antiquity. It was originally of great length, but Brahma in\r\nmercy to mankind shortened it. Fragments now only remain, and these in\r\nthe works of commentators. Two divisions treat of surgery. 1st, _Salya_\r\ntreats of the surgery of the removal of foreign bodies, pus, and the\r\ndead child from the uterus; of healing wounds caused by knives, etc.;\r\nof bandaging, operations, blistering, and the treatment of abscesses\r\nand inflammations. 2nd, _Sálákya_ treats of diseases of the eyes, ears,\r\nmouth, and nose. 3rd, _Káyachikitsá_ describes diseases affecting the\r\nwhole body, as fevers, dysentery, etc. This section may be considered\r\nas constituting the practice of medicine. 4th, _Bhutavidya_ deals with\r\nthe art of restoring the deranged faculties of the mind produced by\r\ndemoniacal possession, as by the anger of the gods, devils, giants, or\r\nspirits of dead men. They can only be removed by prayers, medicines,\r\nablution, and offerings to the offended deity. 5th, _Kaumárabhritya_\r\ncomprises the treatment of infants and such diseases as in them were\r\ncaused by the displeasure of demons. 6th, _Agadatantra_ is concerned\r\nwith the administration of antidotes. 7th, _Rasáyanatantra_ treats of\r\nthe medicines proper for restoring youth, beauty, and happiness; it\r\nembraced chemistry or alchemy, and its intention was to discover the\r\nuniversal medicine. 8th, _Vájíkaranatantra_ deals with the best means\r\nof increasing the human race: an illusory research, which, like the\r\nsearch for the elixir of life, has even in modern times occupied the\r\nattention of physicians. The sacred _Ayur-Veda_ contained a description\r\nof the structure of the human body as learned from dissection, and a\r\ncomplete system of preventive and curative medicine.\r\n\r\nIn the Shastres (Charaka, Susruta), we learn that the _Ashwins_,\r\nor offspring of the Sun (Surja), were the physicians of the gods;\r\nthey wrote books on medicine, and wrought wonderful cures. When the\r\nfifth head of Brahma was cut off by Bayraba, it was united again by\r\nthe _Ashwins_, so skilled were they in surgery. They also cured the\r\nwounds which the gods received in the battle with the giants. They\r\nhealed also the paralysed arm of Indra. When mankind became wicked,\r\nand consequently diseased, _Bharadwaja_ went to Indra in heaven to\r\nacquire a knowledge of medicine, and the thousand-eyed god taught him\r\nthe healing art. With this knowledge the sage _Bharadwaja_ returned to\r\nearth, and taught the _Rishis_ the principles he had acquired. So the\r\nsages learned to distinguish diseases and the medicines suitable for\r\ntheir cure; they lived to a very great age, writing books called by\r\ntheir own names. _Charaka_ became the instructor of practitioners upon\r\nearth, and his is the most ancient and famous work on Hindu medicine.\r\nCharaka, whom we may term the Hindu Hippocrates, flourished at Benares,\r\nprobably about B.C. 320. The most celebrated and ancient collection of\r\nHindu laws and precepts is that which is known as “the Code of Menu,”\r\nor “Institutes of Menu.” It is probably the oldest and most sacred\r\nSanskrit work after the Veda and its Sutras, and presents us with a\r\nfaithful picture of the customs and institutions of the Hindus.\r\n\r\nThe Code of Menu lays it down that diseases are the consequences of\r\nsinful acts in previous states of existence. “Men of evil manners\r\nreceive an alteration of form, some through evil (deeds) committed\r\n(by them) in this life, some also through (acts) formerly committed.\r\nA thief of gold (receives) the disease of bad nails; a drinker of\r\nintoxicating liquor (the disease of) black teeth; a slayer of a\r\nBrahman, consumption; he who violates the couch of the Guru, a skin\r\ndisease; a slanderer, a foul-smelling nose; a false informer, a\r\nfoul-smelling mouth; a stealer of grain, the loss of a limb, and\r\none who mixes (grain) a superfluity (of limbs); one who takes food,\r\ndyspepsia; a thief of the voice, dumbness; a thief of clothes, leprosy;\r\na horse-thief, lameness; a stealer of a lamp would (in the next birth)\r\nbecome blind; an extinguisher (of a lamp), one-eyed; by (committing)\r\ninjury (one would get) a condition of disease; by not (committing)\r\ninjury, the condition of not being diseased. Thus, according to the\r\ndifference in their acts, (men who are) blamed by the good are born\r\ndull, dumb, blind, and deformed in appearance. Regularly, then, penance\r\nshould be practised for purification, since those whose sins have not\r\n(thus) been done away with are (re)born with (these) disgraceful marks\r\nattached.”[234]\r\n\r\nPhysicians are referred to several times in the _Ordinances of Menu_.\r\nIn Lect. iv. 179 we are advised that “we should never have a dispute\r\nwith a physician.” We are to avoid eating the “food of a physician and\r\nhunter, if a cruel man,” etc. (Lect. iv. 212). “The food of a physician\r\nis pus” (_Ibid._ 220). In Lect. ix. 284, “A fine (is set) for all\r\nphysicians treating (a case) incorrectly: in (the case of creatures)\r\nnot human (this is) the first, but in (the case of) human beings the\r\nmedium (fine).”[235]\r\n\r\nThe Brahmans believed there was a remedy for every disease, in\r\nconsequence of which they made a very careful examination of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, and so discovered a great number of medicines. If\r\na medicine were efficacious in curing the patient, they invariably\r\nsupposed it was due to the sanctity of the individual, and the divine\r\npleasure which endowed him with it. It is therefore exceedingly\r\ndifficult to obtain information, as it is believed that the medicine\r\nwould lose its effect if the secret of the cure were divulged to\r\nothers. From these selfish motives, the knowledge of the properties of\r\nmany valuable remedies have been lost. Dr. Wise says, according to the\r\nBrahmans, there are nine secrets which should not be revealed to any\r\none: these are the age of a person; his wealth; family occurrences;\r\nhis bad actions, or those which reflect shame or dishonour upon him;\r\nhis relations with his wife; his prayers to his tutelar gods; his\r\ncharities; and the virtues of nostrums, the ingredients of which are\r\nknown to him.\r\n\r\nYet priests, says Baas, from the Brahman caste, and the sub-castes, the\r\nVaisya and Vaidya, officiated for a long time as teachers of medicine\r\nand as physicians. The Vaidyas, as the higher of the two sub-castes,\r\nincluded the physicians proper; while the Vaisyas, or lower caste,\r\nfurnished nurses.[238]\r\n\r\nWhen Buddhism passed into modern Hinduism (750-1000 A.D.) the rules\r\nof caste became stricter, and the old fetters were reimposed, and the\r\nBrahmans returned to their ancient principles which forbade them to\r\ncontaminate themselves with blood or morbid matter; they withdrew from\r\nall practice of medicine, and left it entirely to the Vaidyas. After a\r\ntime these also shrank from touching dead bodies. Then public hospitals\r\nwere abolished when Buddhism fell. The Mohammedan conquests which began\r\nabout 1000 A.D. introduced foreign practitioners of physic, who derived\r\ntheir knowledge from Arabic translations of Sanskrit medical classics\r\nand monopolised the patronage of the Mohammedan aristocracy.[239]\r\n\r\nThe only remains of the Buddhist hospitals now existing are the various\r\ninstitutions for animals, supported principally by the Jains, a sort of\r\nProtestants against Brahmanism.[240]\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedan medical practitioners were called “Hukeems,” who\r\nfollowed the principles of Arabian medicine derived from Greek sources.\r\nAs a rule these practitioners only attended on nobles and chiefs. There\r\nis no evidence even that the Mohammedan invaders employed medical men\r\nfor their armies.[241]\r\n\r\nDr. Benjamin Heyne, in his _Tracts on India_, says,[242]—\r\n\r\n“The medical works of the Hindus are neither to be regarded as\r\nmiraculous productions of wisdom, nor as repositories of nonsense.\r\nTheir practical principles, as far as I can judge, are very similar to\r\nour own; and even their theories may be reconciled with ours, if we\r\nmake allowance for their ignorance of anatomy, and the imperfections of\r\ntheir physiological speculations.”\r\n\r\nIn surgery they attained to high proficiency, and our modern\r\nsurgeons have even been able to borrow from them the operation of\r\nrhinoplasty.[243]\r\n\r\nConcerning the medicinal properties of minerals (stones and metals),\r\nplants, animal substances, and the chemical analysis and decomposition\r\nof these, we have also learned much that is extremely valuable from the\r\nHindus. Their _Materia Medica_ is so important, and has played so large\r\na part in Western medical science, that we cannot afford to despise it,\r\nthough the Hindus have contributed so little to the study of natural\r\nscience.[244] Veterinary medicine, so far as the diseases of horses\r\nand elephants are concerned, has received special attention from the\r\nHindus.\r\n\r\nCharaka counsels youths who desire to study medicine to “seek a teacher\r\nwhose precepts are sound and whose practical skill is generally\r\napproved, who is clever, dexterous, upright, and blameless; who knows\r\nalso how to use his hands, has the requisite appliances, and all his\r\nsenses about him; is confident with simple cases, and sure of his\r\ntreatment in difficult ones; of genuine learning, unaffected, not\r\nmorose or passionate, patient and kind to his pupils.” The pupils\r\nshould spring from a family of doctors, and should have lost none of\r\ntheir limbs and none of their senses. “They are to be taught to be\r\nchaste and temperate, to speak the truth, to obey their teacher in\r\nall things, and to wear a beard.” They are advised to read medical\r\ntreatises, attend to the personal instruction of their teacher, and\r\nto associate with other doctors. When the doctor visits his patient\r\nhe should wear good clothes, incline his head, be thoughtful but of\r\nfirm bearing, and observe all possible respect. Once within the house,\r\nword, thought, and attention should be directed to nothing else than\r\nthe examination of the patient and all that concerns his case. He\r\nmust not be a boaster. “Many recoil even from a man of skill if he\r\nloves to boast.” As medicine is difficult to learn, the doctor must\r\npractise carefully and incessantly. He must seek every opportunity for\r\nconversation with a colleague. This will remove doubts, if he have\r\nthem, and fortify his opinion.\r\n\r\nWhen an operation is decided on, a fortunate moment, says Dr. Wise,\r\nis to be selected, and the Brahmans and the surgeons are to be\r\n“propitiated” with gifts. The operating room is to be clean and well\r\nlighted, milk, oil, herbs, hot and cold water are to be at hand, and\r\nstrong attendants to hold the patient. The knife should be wet with\r\nwater before being used. The sky must be clear, and the time should be\r\nnear the new moon. The surgeon must be strong and a rapid operator, and\r\nhe must neither perspire, shake, nor make exclamations. The palms of\r\nthe hands and soles of the feet, vessels, tendons, joints, and bones\r\nare to be avoided. During the operation, care must be taken to keep a\r\nfire burning in the patient’s room, on which sweet-scented substances\r\nare to be burnt, in order to prevent devils entering the patient by\r\nthe wound made by the surgeon. After the operation holy water is to be\r\nsprinkled on the sufferer, and prayer addressed to Brahma. The bandages\r\nare to remain till the third day, and clean ones substituted.[245]\r\n\r\nSusruta was the son of _Visámitra_, a contemporary of Rama, and was\r\nchosen by Dhanwantari, who was the Hindu Æsculapius, to abridge the\r\nAyur-Veda for the cure of diseases and the preservation of the health,\r\nso that it might be more easily committed to memory. Susruta’s book is\r\nstill preserved, and after Charaka’s it is the oldest book on medicine\r\nwhich the Hindus possess. Surgery was considered by Susruta to be “the\r\nfirst and best of the medical sciences; less liable than any other to\r\nthe fallacies of conjectural and inferential practice; pure in itself,\r\nperpetual in its applicability; the worthy produce of heaven, and\r\ncertain source of fame.”\r\n\r\nWise says,[246] “Dhanwantari asked his pupils, On what shall I first\r\nlecture? They answered, On surgery; because formerly there were no\r\ndiseases among the gods, and wounds were the first injuries which\r\nrequired treatment. Besides, the practice of surgery is more respected,\r\nas affording immediate relief, and is connected with the practice of\r\nmedicine; although the latter has no connection with surgery.” This was\r\nagreed to; and we find the explanation of the eight parts of Ayur-Veda,\r\nin six books of Susruta, as follows:—\r\n\r\n1st. Surgery (Sútra Sthána), in which is considered the origin of\r\nmedicine; the rules of teaching, the duty of practitioners, the\r\nselection and uses of instruments and medicines, the influence of the\r\nweather on health, and the practice to be followed after surgical\r\noperations. Then follows the description of the diseases of the\r\nhumours and surgical diseases; the restoration of defective ears and\r\nnoses; and the removal of extraneous substances which have entered\r\nthe body; the different stages of inflammation, with their treatment;\r\ndifferent forms of wounds and ulcers, and the regimen of patients\r\nlabouring under surgical diseases; the description of good and bad\r\ndiet; of prognosis; the kind of messengers to be employed by the sick;\r\nand of diseases produced by the deranged actions of the senses, and\r\nof incurable diseases. Then follows the preparations required for\r\naccompanying a rajah in war, the duty of practitioners, the difference\r\nof climates, the different classes of medicines according to their\r\nsensible qualities, a description of the fluids, and of the different\r\npreparations, and articles of food. These subjects are treated of in\r\nthirty-six chapters.\r\n\r\n2nd. Nosology (Nidána Sthána). The description and diagnosis of\r\ndiseases produced by vitiated humous, or derangements of blood, bile,\r\nwind, and phlegm; the symptoms and causes of rheumatic diseases, of\r\npiles, of stone, fistula-in-ano, leprosy, diabetes, gonorrhœa, and\r\nascites; the symptoms of unnatural presentations in midwifery, large\r\ninternal abscesses, erysipelas, scrofula, hydrocele, venereal diseases,\r\nand diseases of the mouth. These subjects are considered in sixteen\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\n3rd. Anatomy (Saríra Sthána), or structure of the body. The description\r\nof the soul, and the elementary parts of the body; of puberty; of\r\nconception; of the growth of the different parts of the body; of\r\nbleeding; of the treatment of pregnancy, and of infants. This division\r\nhas ten chapters.\r\n\r\n4th. Therapeutics (Chikitsa Sthána), in which the exhibition of\r\nmedicines, the history of inflammations, the treatment of fractures,\r\nrheumatic diseases, piles, fistula-in-ano, leprosy, diabetes, and\r\ndropsy are given; the manner of extracting the child in unusual\r\npositions, the remedies for restoring health and strength, and for\r\nprolonging life; the means of preventing diseases; the use of clysters,\r\nand of errhines, and the use of the smoke of different substances.\r\nThese are considered in forty chapters.\r\n\r\n5th. Toxicology (Kalpa Sthána). The means of distinguishing poisoned\r\nfood, and descriptions of different mineral, vegetable, and animal\r\npoisons, with their antidotes, is given under this head. This division\r\nis treated of in eight chapters.\r\n\r\n6th. The supplementary section, Locales (Uttara Sthána), includes\r\nvarious local diseases; as those of the eye, nose, ears and head,\r\nwith their treatment; the symptoms and treatment of fever, and its\r\nvarieties; dysentery, consumption; _gulma_; diseases of the heart;\r\njaundice; discharges of blood, and fainting. This is followed by the\r\ntreatment of intoxication, of cough, hiccough, asthma, hoarseness of\r\nvoice, worms, stercoraceous vomiting, cholera, dyspepsia, and dysuria.\r\nIt also treats of madness, epilepsy, apoplexy; the different tastes\r\nof substances, with their effects; the means of retaining health, and\r\nthe different opinions of practitioners regarding the humours. These\r\nsubjects are treated in sixty-six chapters.\r\n\r\nAccording to Susruta a pupil had to be initiated into the Science\r\nof Medicine. “A medical man should initiate a pupil who is either a\r\nBrahmana, Kshatriya, or Vaishya, the members of whose body are sound,\r\nof an amiable disposition, active, well-conducted, mild, healthy,\r\nvigorous, talented, courageous, of a retentive memory, good judgment\r\nand rank, whose tooth-ends, tongue, and lips are small, whose eyes,\r\nnose, and mouth are straight, of a pleasant mind, talk, and behaviour,\r\nand able to bear fatigue; other such should not be initiated.”\r\n\r\nMany ceremonies follow; an altar is to be erected having four angles\r\nin some conspicuous direction, which is to be washed with infusion of\r\ncow-dung and spread with kúsa grass; precious stones and rice are to\r\nbe scattered upon it, and a fire is to be kindled with a number of\r\nprecious woods, an oblation of ghee is to be made, and the mystic words\r\nBhúr Bhuvah Svar and Om are to be said. “After this hail each divinity\r\n(Brahma, Agni, Dhanvantari, Prajápati, Asvins, and Indra) and each Sage\r\n(the Rishis), and make the pupil do the same.”\r\n\r\nStenzler and others have thought it possible that Susruta borrowed his\r\nsystem of medicine largely from the Greeks, and they say that so far\r\nas chronology is affected by it there would be nothing surprising in\r\nthe circumstance. But Weber asserts[247] that no grounds whatever exist\r\nfor this supposition; on the contrary, there is much to tell against\r\nsuch an idea. None of the contemporaries of Susruta has a name with a\r\nforeign sound, and the cultivation of medicine is assigned by Susruta\r\nand other writers to the city of Benares. The weights and measures to\r\nbe employed by the physician are those of the eastern provinces, which\r\nnever came into close contact with the Greeks, and it was first in\r\nthese parts where medicine received its special cultivation.\r\n\r\nIn the general treatment of disease, the Hindus paid great attention to\r\ndiet, so as to promote the just balance of the elements and humours,\r\nas they considered that the generality of diseases are produced by\r\nderangements in the humours. Many of their statements on dietetics\r\nshow a keen observation. If management of diet failed to cure the\r\ndisorder, the patient was directed to abstain from food altogether\r\nfor a time. Should this also fail, recourse was had to ejecting the\r\ncorrupted humours by emetics, purgatives, or bleeding. Even the healthy\r\nwere advised to take an emetic once a fortnight, a purgative once a\r\nmonth, and to be bled twice a year at the change of the seasons. The\r\nHindus observed the “critical days” which have long been recognised by\r\nphysicians everywhere. Pythagoras says the Egyptians observed them, and\r\nHippocrates employed the term κρασις when the humoral pathology was\r\nin vogue. The Hindus thought that all diseases divide naturally into\r\ntwo classes of the sthenic and asthenic types. In the one there was\r\nexcess, in the other deficiency of excitement. Health consists in a\r\nhappy medium. All the Asiatic nations hold this opinion. Their remedies\r\nconsequently were stimulating or cooling, as the type of the malady\r\ndemanded. Pepper, bitters, and purgatives were stimulants. Stomachics,\r\nas _chiraitá_, paun mixed with lime, bathing and cold were cooling\r\nremedies.[248]\r\n\r\nThe sages of antiquity have handed down to us the qualities which\r\nconstitute a good physician. He must be strictly truthful, and of\r\nthe greatest sobriety and decorum; he must have no dealings with any\r\nwomen but his own wife; he must be a man of sense and benevolence,\r\nof a charitable heart, and of a calm temper, constantly studying how\r\nto do good. Such a man is a good physician if, in addition to this,\r\nhe constantly endeavours to improve his mind by the study of good\r\nbooks. He is not to be peevish with an irritable patient; he must be\r\ncourageous and hopeful to the last day of his patient’s life; always\r\nfrank, communicative, and impartial, he is yet to be rigid in seeing\r\nthat his orders are carried out.\r\n\r\nHindu physicians make their prognosis a strong point in their practice;\r\nthere are, they say, certain signs which to the experienced eye enable\r\nthe doctor to prognosticate the favourable or fatal termination of a\r\ndisorder. And in the first place a good deal is to be learned from\r\nthe messenger who summons him to the patient, and so he notes his\r\nappearance, his dress, his manner of speaking; he notes the time of\r\nday and other circumstances, as these are all considered to have an\r\ninfluence on the result of the illness. It is considered unfavourable\r\nif many people follow each other to call the doctor. If the messenger\r\nsees a man arrive riding on an ass, or if he has a stick, string, or\r\nfruit in his hand, if he is dressed in red, black, or net clothes, if\r\nhe sneezes, is deformed, agitated, crying, or scratching himself,—all\r\nthese are bad signs. Not less so is it unfavourable when the physician\r\nis called at noonday or midnight, when he has his face turned towards\r\nthe south, when he is eating, or when he is asleep or fatigued.[249]\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor arrives at the bedside, it is an unfavourable sign\r\nif the patient rubs one hand against another, scratches his back,\r\nor constantly moves his head. There are eight most severe forms of\r\ndisease—the nervous class, tetanus and paralysis; leprosy; piles,\r\nfistula-in-ano, stone; unnatural presentations in labour; and dropsy of\r\nthe abdomen. These are cured with great difficulty, say the Hindus.\r\n\r\nIt is a good sign when the patient’s voice remains unaltered, when he\r\nawakes from sleep without starting, when he remains cool after food,\r\nand when he does not forget his god, but is prayerful and resigned.\r\n\r\n“When the messenger finds the physician sitting in a clean place,\r\nwith his face towards the east, and the messenger has in his hands a\r\nwater-pot full of water, with an umbrella, they are favourable signs.”\r\n\r\n“In Ceylon it is affirmed by the Shastree Brahmans that the Science\r\nof Medicine was communicated by _Măhă Brăhma_ to the _Brăhma Dăkshă\r\nPrajapatí_; by _Prajapatí_ it was communicated to the _Aswins_ (the\r\nphysicians of heaven): the two _Aswins_ communicated it to _Satora_,\r\nthe chief of the gods inhabiting the six lower heavens, by whom it was\r\ncommunicated to the nine sages, mentioned, on their going to him with\r\none accord to seek a remedy for the evils brought upon mankind by their\r\niniquities; they communicated it to the King of Casi (_Benares_), whose\r\ndescendants caused it to be committed to writing.”[250]\r\n\r\nArrianus, in his history of Alexander’s expedition to India, says that\r\n“speckled snakes of a wonderful size and swiftness” are found in that\r\ncountry, and that “The Grecian physicians found no remedy against\r\nthe bite of these snakes; but the Indians cured those who happened\r\nto fall under that misfortune; for which reason, Nearchus tells us,\r\nAlexander having all the most skilful Indians about his person, caused\r\nproclamation to be made throughout the camp that whoever was bit by\r\none of these snakes, should forthwith repair to the royal pavilion\r\nfor cure. These physicians also cure other diseases; but as they have\r\na very temperate clime, the inhabitants are not subject to many.\r\nHowever, if any among them feel themselves much indisposed, they apply\r\nthemselves to their sophists, who by wonderful, and even more than\r\nhuman means, cure whatever will admit of it.”[251]\r\n\r\nStrabo speaks of the Hindu philosophers or sages, and the physicians.\r\n“Of the Garmanes, the most honourable,” he says, “are the Hylobii,\r\nwho live in the forests, and subsist on leaves and wild fruits; they\r\nare clothed with garments made of the bark of trees, and abstain from\r\ncommerce with women and from wine. The kings hold communication with\r\nthem by messengers concerning the causes of things, and through them\r\nworship and supplicate the Divinity. Second in honour to the Hylobii\r\nare the physicians, for they apply philosophy to the study of the\r\nnature of man. They are of frugal habits, but do not live in the\r\nfields, and subsist upon rice and bread, which every one gives when\r\nasked, and receive them hospitably. They are able to cause persons to\r\nhave a numerous offspring, and to have either male or female children,\r\nby means of charms. They cure diseases by diet, rather than by\r\nmedicinal remedies. Among the latter, the most in repute are ointments\r\nand plasters. All others they suppose partake greatly of a noxious\r\nnature.”[252] They had enchanters and diviners versed in the arts of\r\nmagic, who went about the villages and towns begging.\r\n\r\nArrianus said of the Hindus that their women were deemed marriageable\r\nat seven years of age; but the men, not till they arrive at the age of\r\nforty.[253]\r\n\r\nMany charms, imprecations, and other superstitious usages of ancient\r\nIndia are contained in the Atharva-veda-Samhitâ. This body of\r\nliterature dates, according to Max Müller, from 1000 to 800 B.C. (the\r\nMantra period).[254] In this Samhitâ a number of songs are addressed\r\nto illnesses, and the healing herbs appropriate for their cure.\r\nSarpa-vidyá (serpent-science) possibly dealt with medical matters\r\nalso.[255]\r\n\r\nThe oldest fragments (very poor ones, it must be confessed) of Hindu\r\nmedical science are to be found in these relics of Vedic times.\r\n\r\nIn a work on Indian medicine called the _Kalpastanum_ described by Dr.\r\nHeyne,[256] we read that the doctor’s apparatus of mortars, scales,\r\netc., must be kept in a place in the wall that has been consecrated for\r\nthat purpose by religious ceremonies. In the middle of the medicine\r\nroom the mystic sign must be set up, with images of Brahma, Vishnu, and\r\nSiva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mystic sign]\r\n\r\nMany ceremonies must be gone through in the preparation of medicines;\r\nthe physician must attend to the boiling of some of them himself,\r\nand the spot round the fireplace must be smeared with cow-dung by a\r\nvirgin, or by the mother of sons whose husband is alive; at the same\r\ntime, offerings must be made to the gods. Should any of the ceremonies\r\nbe omitted, the patient will repent the neglect, for devils of all\r\ndescriptions will defile the medicine and hinder its good effect.\r\nBefore the patient takes his potion, the god of physic is to be\r\nworshipped in the person of his deputy, the doctor, who naturally (and\r\nfor the good of the patient) is to be well rewarded for his services.\r\n\r\nBuddhism, says Max Müller, is the frontier between ancient and modern\r\nliterature in India. He gives 477 B.C. as the probable date of Buddha’s\r\ndeath,[257] and describes the religion of that great sage as standing\r\nin the same relation to the ancient Brahmanism of the Veda as Italian\r\nto Latin, or as Protestantism to Catholicism. It is a development from\r\nBrahmanism, yet it is not the religion of India, though it has greatly\r\ninfluenced Hindu thought.[258]\r\n\r\nBuddha’s religious system recognised no supreme deity; a Buddhist never\r\nreally prays, he merely contemplates.[259]\r\n\r\nMan can himself become the only god Buddha’s system finds room for.\r\nGod becomes man in Brahmanism; man becomes a god in Buddhism. All\r\nexistence is an evil to the Buddhist; “act” is to be got rid of as\r\neffectually as possible, for action means existence. The great end of\r\nthe system is _Nirvāna_, or non-existence. “Of priests and clergy in\r\nour sense,” says Professor Williams, “the Buddhist religion has none.”\r\nThough there is no God, prayer is practised as a kind of charm against\r\ndiseases; for malignant demons, as we might have expected, are believed\r\nby Buddhists to cause these and other evils. These Buddhist prayers\r\nare used like the Mantras of the Brahmins as charms against evils of\r\nall kinds. The Buddhists have a demon of love, anger, evil, and death,\r\ncalled Māra, the opponent of Buddha. He can send forth legions of evil\r\ndemons like himself. Some of the precepts of Buddha are fully equal to\r\nthose of the highest religions—Charity, Virtue, Patience, Fortitude,\r\nMeditation, and Knowledge. The special characteristic of Buddhism\r\nis the perfection of its tenderness and mercy towards all living\r\ncreatures, even beasts of prey and noxious insects not being outside\r\nthe circle of its sympathy. According to the Buddhist’s belief, all our\r\nacts ripen and go to form our Karma. The consequences of our acts must\r\ninexorably be worked out. This is Brahminical as well as Buddhistic\r\ndoctrine. “In the Sábda-kalpa-druma, under the head of _Karma-vipāka_,”\r\nsays Williams, “will be found a long catalogue of the various diseases\r\nwith which men are born, as the fruit of evil deeds committed in former\r\nstates of existence, and a declaration as to the number of births\r\nthrough which each disease will be protracted, unless, expiations be\r\nperformed in the present life.”[260]\r\n\r\nAll our sufferings, our sicknesses, weaknesses, and moral depravity\r\nare simply the consequences of our actions in former bodies. When the\r\nJews asked our Lord, “Who did sin, this man (_i.e._ in a former life)\r\nor his parents, that he was born blind?”[261] they evidently had in\r\ntheir minds the Hindu doctrine of previous existences. The principles\r\nof the Brahminic religion do not appear to have embraced any care for\r\nor attention to the needs of sick people. Involved in philosophical\r\nspeculations, and the perfecting of their system of caste, the founders\r\nof the Brahminic religion had no time to bestow on such mundane matters\r\nas disease and its cure. It was not until the rise of Buddhism and the\r\npolitical ascendency which it acquired over Brahmanism (from about 250\r\nB.C. to A.D. 600), that public hospitals were established for man and\r\nanimals in the great cities of the Buddhist princes.[262] Buddhism had\r\na gospel for every living creature; it taught the spiritual equality\r\nof all men, whose good works, without the mediation of priests and\r\nBrahmins, would save them from future punishment. Medicine, under the\r\nfostering care of Buddhism, was studied as any other science, and\r\nthe noblest outcome of the movement was the establishment of public\r\nhospitals. A great seat of medical learning was established at Benares,\r\nand Asoka, King of Behar or Putra, published fourteen Edicts, one of\r\nwhich devised a system of medical care for man and beast.[263]\r\n\r\nAmongst the legends of Gotama Buddha is the history of Jíwaka, which is\r\nof great interest to the historians of medicine, as it illustrates the\r\nstate of the science in India at that early age. The following account\r\nis abbreviated from Mr. Spence Hardy’s translation of Singhalese\r\nMSS.[264]\r\n\r\nJíwaka was a physician who administered medicine to Budha. He learned\r\nhis profession in this way. When he was seven or eight years of age,\r\nhe ran away from his parents, resolving that he would learn some\r\nscience; so he considered the character of the eighteen sciences and\r\nthe sixty-four arts, and determined that he would study the art of\r\nmedicine, that he might be called doctor, and be respected, and attain\r\nto eminence. So he went to the collegiate city of Taksalá[265] and\r\napplied to a learned professor to take him into his school of medicine.\r\nThe professor asked him what fees he had brought with him. Jíwaka\r\nsaid he had no money, but he was willing to work. The professor liked\r\nthe manner of the lad, and agreed to teach him, though from other\r\npupils he received a thousand masurans. At this moment the throne of\r\nSekra trembled, as Jíwaka had been acquiring merit, and was soon to\r\nadminister medicine to Gotama Budha. The déwa resolved that as he was\r\nto become the physician of Budha, he would himself be his teacher;\r\nand for this purpose he came to the earth, entered the mouth of the\r\nprofessor, and inspired him with the wisdom he needed to teach his\r\npupil in the most excellent manner.\r\n\r\nJíwaka made rapid progress, and soon discovered that he could treat\r\nthe patients more successfully than his master. He learned in seven\r\nyears as much about diseases as any other teacher could have taught\r\nhim in sixteen. Then Jíwaka asked his preceptor when his education\r\nwould be finished; and the old man, wishing to test his knowledge, told\r\nhim to take a basket and go outside the city for the space of sixteen\r\nmiles, and collect all the roots, barks, leaves, and fruits which were\r\nuseless in the art of medicine. Jíwaka did as he was instructed, and\r\nafter four days he returned and informed the professor that he had\r\nmet with no substance which in some way or other was not useful in\r\nmedicine; there was no such thing on earth. Now when the teacher heard\r\nthis reply, he said, there was no one who could teach the pupil any\r\nmore, and Sekra departed from his mouth. He knew that his pupil had\r\nbeen taught by divine wisdom. Then Jíwaka journeyed to Sákétu, where\r\nhe found a woman who had a violent pain in her head, which for seven\r\nyears many learned physicians had vainly tried to cure. He offered\r\nto cure her, but she said, “If all the learned doctors had failed to\r\nrelieve her, it was useless to seek the aid of a little child.” Jíwaka\r\nreplied that “Science is neither old nor young. I will not go away\r\ntill the headache is entirely cured.” Then the woman said, “My son,\r\ngive me relief for a single day: it is seven years since I was able\r\nto sleep.” So Jíwaka poured a little medicine into her nose, which\r\nwent into her brain, and behold, all her headache was gone; and the\r\nlady and her relations each gave the physician 4,000 níla-karshas,\r\nwith chariots, and other, and other gifts in abundance. After this\r\nhe cured the king of a fistula-in-ano, for which he received a royal\r\nreward. There was in Rajagaha a rich nobleman who had a pain in his\r\nhead like the cutting of a knife. None of his physicians could cure\r\nhim, so Jíwaka took the noble into a room, sat behind him, and taking\r\na very sharp instrument, opened his skull; and setting aside the three\r\nsutures, he seized the two worms which were gnawing his brain with\r\na forceps, and extracted them entire. He then closed up the wound\r\nin such a manner that not a single hair was displaced. There was a\r\nnobleman in Benares who had twisted one of his intestines into a knot,\r\nso that he was not able to pass any solid food. Crowds of physicians\r\ncame to see him, but none of them dare undertake his case; but Jíwaka\r\nsaid at once he could cure him. He bound his patient to a pillar that\r\nhe might not move, covered his face, and taking a sharp instrument,\r\nwithout the noble’s being aware of what was going on, ripped open the\r\nabdomen, took out his intestines, undid the knot, and replaced them\r\nin a proper manner. He then rubbed ointment on the place, put the\r\npatient to bed, fed him on rice-gruel, and in three days he was as\r\nwell as ever. Of course he had an immense fee. After performing other\r\nwonderful cures, Jíwaka administered medicine to Budha in the perfume\r\nof a flower. The narrative must be given in the words of the MS.: “In\r\nthis way was the medicine given. On a certain occasion when Budha was\r\nsick, it was thought that if he were to take a little opening medicine\r\nhe would be better; and accordingly Ananda went to Jíwaka to inform\r\nhim that the teacher of the world was indisposed. On receiving this\r\ninformation, Jíwaka, who thought that the time to which he had so long\r\nlooked forward had arrived, went to the wihára, as Budha was at that\r\ntime residing near Rajagaha. After making the proper inquiries, he\r\ndiscovered that there were three causes of the disease; and in order\r\nto remove them he prepared three lotus flowers, into each of which he\r\nput a quantity of medicine. The flowers were given to Budha at three\r\nseparate times, and by smelling at them his bowels were moved ten times\r\nby each flower. By means of the first flower the first cause of disease\r\npassed away, and by the other two the second and third causes were\r\nremoved.”\r\n\r\nThis legend is instructive in many ways. It shows us that 500 B.C.\r\nthere were colleges in which medicine was taught, and that by special\r\nprofessors of the art, who received large fees from their pupils and\r\nkept them under instruction for many years. We find that the profession\r\nof medicine brought great honours and rewards to its adepts. We learn\r\nthat trephining the skull for cerebral diseases was in use, and that\r\nthe operation of opening the abdomen for bowel obstructions was\r\nunderstood. It reveals the important fact that already the whole of\r\nnature had been ransacked for remedies, and that everything was more\r\nor less useful to the physician. The great efficacy which the ancients\r\nattributed to perfumes is exhibited in the lotus story, which reminds\r\nus that when Democritus was aware that he was dying, he desired to\r\nprolong his life beyond the festival of Ceres, and accomplished his\r\nwish by inhaling the vapour of hot bread.\r\n\r\nGalen’s description of the pulse in disease is very suggestive of the\r\nancient Sanskrit treatises on the pulse; so much is this the case, it\r\nwould seem, that either the Hindu physician must have copied from the\r\nRoman, or the Roman from the Indian. He speaks of the _sharp-tailed_\r\nor _myuri_, _fainting myuri_, _recurrent myuri_, _the goat-leap_ or\r\n_dorcadissans_, a term derived from the animal _dorcas_, which, in\r\njumping aloft, stops in the air, and then unexpectedly takes another\r\nand a swifter spring than the former. But if after the diastole it\r\nrecur, and before a complete systole take place, strike the finger\r\na second time; such a pulse is called a _reverberating_ one, or\r\n_dicrotos_, from its beating twice. There is also the _undulatory_ and\r\n_vermicular_ pulse, the _spasmodic_ and _vibratory_, the _ant-like_ or\r\n_formicans_, from its resemblance to the ant (_formica_), on account\r\nof its smallness and kind of motion; there is the _hectic_, the\r\n_serrated_, the _fat_ and the _lean_ kind.\r\n\r\nMedical etiquette amongst the Hindus was not overlooked.\r\n\r\n“A physician who desires success in his practice, his own profit, a\r\ngood name, and finally a place in heaven, must pray daily for all\r\nliving creatures, first of the Brahmans and of the cow. The physician\r\nshould wear his hair short, keep his nails clean[266] and cut close,\r\nand wear a sweet-smelling dress. He should never leave the house\r\nwithout a cane or umbrella; he should avoid especially any familiarity\r\nwith women. Let his speech be soft, clear, pleasant. Transactions in\r\nthe house should not be bruited abroad.”[267]\r\n\r\nThe dissection and examination of the dead subject is not practised in\r\nIndia, it is contrary to the tenets of the Brahmans; such knowledge\r\nof anatomy as the Hindus possess must therefore be little else than\r\nconjecture, formed by the study of the bodies of animals. Ainslie\r\nsays[268] that the Rajah of Tanjore, in the year 1826, was a learned\r\nand enlightened prince, who was anxious to study the structure of the\r\nhuman body, but was too rigid a Hindu to satisfy his curiosity at the\r\nexpense of his principles, so he ordered a complete skeleton made of\r\nivory to be sent to him from England. Sir William Jones states that in\r\na fragment of the _Ayur-Veda_ he was surprised to find an account of\r\nthe internal structure of the human frame.[269]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Hindus must have possessed considerable knowledge of\r\nsurgery. In a commentary on Susruta made by Ubhatta, a Cashmirian,\r\nwhich may be as old, Ainslie thinks, as the twelfth century, many\r\nvaluable surgical definitions are distinctly detailed. According\r\nto the best authorities, says Ainslie, surgery was of eight kinds:\r\n_chedhana_, cutting or excision; _lekhana_, or scarification and\r\ninoculation; _vyadhana_, puncturing; _eshyam_, probing or sounding;\r\n_aharya_, extraction of solid bodies; _visravana_, extracting fluids\r\n(by leeches and bleeding); _sevana_, or sewing; and _bhedana_, division\r\nor excision.[270]\r\n\r\nTwelve species of leeches are enumerated in some of the Sanskrit works\r\non surgery, six of which are poisonous and six useful medicinally.[271]\r\n\r\nDissection was practised in the most ancient times; but now there is\r\nthe greatest prejudice against touching the dead body, and modern\r\npractitioners of Hindu medicine, where they do not follow the ancient\r\nauthors, are in a worse condition than they were, on account of the\r\npresent ignorance of anatomy. All the sages are alleged to have learned\r\ntheir knowledge of medicine from the works of Charaka and Susruta.\r\nThose who were taught by Charaka became physicians; those who were\r\nfollowers of Susruta, surgeons. Charaka’s classification and plan of\r\ntreating diseases are considered superior to those of Susruta, but\r\nthe latter is prized for his anatomy and surgery. Babhata compiled a\r\ncompendium of medicine from the works of these great masters of the\r\nart, and some three hundred years ago a compilation was made from all\r\nthe most celebrated works on medicine; this was called _Baboprukasa_.\r\nIt is clear and well arranged, and explains the difficulties and\r\nobscurities of the ancient Shastres. This was compiled as a text-book\r\nfor practitioners, and is in high repute with them. Dr. Wise explains\r\nthe ancient methods of dissecting the human body as given in Hindu\r\ntext-books.\r\n\r\n“The dejections are to be removed, and the body washed and placed in a\r\nframework of wood, properly secured by means of grass, hemp, sugar-cane\r\nreeds, corn-straw, pea-stalks, or the like. The body is then to be\r\nplaced in still water, in a moving stream, where it will not be injured\r\nby birds, fish, or animals. It is to remain for seven days and nights\r\nin the water, when it will have become putrid. It is then to be removed\r\nto a convenient situation, and with a brush, made of reeds, hair, or\r\nbamboo bark, the surface of the body is to be removed so as to exhibit\r\nthe skin, flesh, etc., which are each in their turn to be observed\r\nbefore being removed. In this manner, the different corporeal parts of\r\nthe body will be exhibited; but the life of the body is too ethereal\r\nto be distinguished by this process, and its properties must therefore\r\nbe learned with the assistance of the explanations of holy medical\r\npractitioners, and prayers offered up to God, by which, conjoined with\r\nthe exercise of the reasoning and understanding faculties, conviction\r\nwill be certainly obtained.”[272]\r\n\r\nThe Hindus have been great observers of the natural qualities of\r\nplants, though they have contributed little or nothing to the study\r\nof botany. “The _materia medica_ of the Hindus,” says Hunter,[273]\r\n“embraces a vast collection of drugs belonging to the mineral,\r\nvegetable, and animal kingdoms, many of which have been adopted by\r\nEuropean physicians.” They were ingenious pharmacists, and some\r\nof their directions for the administration of medicines are most\r\nelaborate. They paid scrupulous attention to hygiene, regimen, and diet.\r\n\r\nHindu treatises on medicine inform the physician that man’s\r\nconstitution is occasioned by three dispositions born with him—_wadum_,\r\n_pittum_, and _chestum_, or wind, bile, and slime,—and it is the\r\nphysician’s business to ascertain which of these predominate in any\r\nindividual. These we may call the three morbiferous diatheses. The\r\npulse is to be felt, not merely at the wrist as we feel it, but in ten\r\ndifferent parts of the body. Some of the descriptions of the pulse are\r\nvery curious. Sometimes, they say, it beats as a frog jumps, or as a\r\ncreeping rain-worm, or like the motion of a child in a cradle hung in\r\nchains; at other times it is like a fowl when running or as a peacock\r\nwhen strutting, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe Yantras or surgical implements known to Susruta were, according to\r\nProfessor H. H. Wilson, one hundred and one, and are thus described by\r\nhim in his most interesting paper on the “Medical and Surgical Sciences\r\nof the Hindus.”[274]\r\n\r\nThe instruments were classed as Swastikas, Sandanśas, Tálayantras,\r\nNádiyantras, Salákás, and Upayantras.\r\n\r\nThe _Swastikas_ are twenty-four in number; they are metallic, about\r\neighteen inches long, and fancifully shaped like the beaks of birds,\r\netc. They were a sort of pincers or forceps.\r\n\r\nThe _Sandanśas_ were a kind of tongs for removing extraneous substances\r\nfrom the soft parts.\r\n\r\nThe _Tálayantras_ were similar, and were used for bringing away foreign\r\nbodies from the ears, nose, etc.\r\n\r\nThe _Nádiyantras_ were tubular instruments, of which there were twenty\r\nsorts. They were similar to our catheters, syringes, etc. The _Salákás_\r\nwere rods and sounds, etc. Of these there were twenty-eight kinds;\r\nsome were for removing nasal polypi, so common and so troublesome in\r\nIndia. The _Upayantras_ were such dressings as cloth, twine, leather,\r\netc. The first, best, and most important of all implements is declared\r\nto be the _Hand_. The _Man’dalágra_ was a round pointed lancet; the\r\n_Vriddhipatra_ a broad knife; the _Arddhadhárás_ are perhaps knives\r\nwith one edge; the _Trikúrchaka_ may be a sort of canular trochar,\r\nwith a guarded point. The _Vrihimukha_ is a perforating instrument.\r\nThe _Kutháriká_ was probably a bistoury. The _Vadiśa_ is a hooked\r\nor curved instrument for extracting foreign substances, and the\r\n_Dantaśanku_ appears to be an instrument for drawing teeth. The _Ará_\r\nand _Karapatra_ are saws for cutting through bones. The _Eshan’i_ is a\r\nblunt straight instrument six or eight inches long—a sort of probe, in\r\nfact. The _Súchi_ is a needle. Then the Hindu surgeon had substitutes\r\nsuch as rough leaves that draw blood, pith of trees, skin, leeches,\r\ncaustics, etc. It is evident that the surgeon of ancient India was not\r\ninefficiently armed.\r\n\r\nThe student of surgery had many curious contrivances for acquiring\r\nmanual dexterity. He practised the art of making incisions on wax\r\nspread out on a board; on flowers, bulbs, and gourds. Skins or bladders\r\nfilled with paste and mire were used for the same purpose. He practised\r\nscarification on the fresh hides of animals from which the hair has\r\nnot been removed; puncturing, or lancing the vessels of dead animals;\r\nextraction on the cavities of the same, or fruits with large seeds;\r\nsutures were made on skin and leather, and ligatures and bandages on\r\nwell-made models of the human limbs. Fourteen kinds of bandages are\r\ndescribed by Vágbhatta. The cautery was applied by hot seeds, burning\r\nsubstances, or heated plates and probes. Frequently this treatment was\r\nused for headaches and for liver and spleen disorders. It was chiefly\r\nemployed, however, as with the Greeks, for averting bleeding by searing\r\nthe mouths of the divided vessels. The early Hindus could extract\r\nstone from the bladder, and even the fœtus from the uterus. They must\r\nhave been bold operators, many of their operations being actually\r\nhazardous. It is a subject deserving of inquiry how they lost the\r\ninformation and skill which they once possessed in so high a degree.\r\nThe books of medicine and surgery to which reference has been made are\r\nundoubtedly most ancient, and it must be remembered were considered\r\nas inspired writings. Professor Wilson says: “We must infer that the\r\nexisting sentiments of the Hindus are of modern date, growing out of\r\nan altered state of society, and unsupported by their oldest and most\r\nauthentic civil and moral, as well as medical institutes.”\r\n\r\nMany surgical operations which we consider triumphs of our modern\r\npractice were invented by the ancient Hindus. They were skilled in\r\namputation, in lithotomy (as we have seen), in abdominal and uterine\r\noperations; they operated for hernia, fistula, and piles, set broken\r\nbones, and had specialists in rhinoplasty or operations for restoring\r\nlost ears and noses. It was a common custom in India for a jealous\r\nhusband to mutilate the nose of his suspected wife, so that surgeons\r\nhad opportunities to practise this branch of their art. The ancient\r\nIndian surgeons invented an operation for neuralgia which was very\r\nsimilar to the modern division of the fifth nerve above the eyebrow.\r\nVeterinary science was understood, and ancient treatises exist, says\r\nHunter,[275] on the diseases of elephants and horses.\r\n\r\nThe best era of Hindu medicine was from 250 B.C. to 750 A.D. Its\r\nchief centres were found in such Buddhist monastic universities as\r\nthat of Nalanda, near Gayá.[276] Hunter thinks it probable that the\r\nancient Brahmans may have derived their anatomical knowledge from the\r\ndissection of the sacrifices; but there is no doubt that the true\r\nschools of Indian medicine were the great public hospitals which were\r\nestablished by Buddhist princes like Asoka, famous for his rock edicts,\r\nB.C. 251-249. Amongst the fourteen injunctions inscribed by this\r\nenlightened sovereign, the first was the prohibition of the slaughter\r\nof animals for food or sacrifice, and the second was the provision of a\r\nsystem of medical aid for men and animals and of plantations and wells\r\non the roadside.[277]\r\n\r\nProbably King Asoka’s were the first real hospitals for general\r\ndiseases anywhere established, as the institutions connected with\r\nthe Greek temples were not exactly hospitals in our sense of the\r\nterm; they were more like camps round a mineral spring or spa. The\r\nBuddhist physicians would have in these merciful institutions abundant\r\nopportunity for the continuous study of disease.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the condition of ancient Hindu anatomy and\r\nsurgery, in modern times both have now fallen to the lowest point.\r\nDislocated joints are replaced and fractured limbs set by a class\r\nof men similar to our bone-setters which are found in all nations.\r\nCertain of the Mohammedan doctors—_Hakeems_—sometimes bleed and couch\r\nfor cataract in a clumsy manner. The village _Kabiráj_ knows but a few\r\nsentences of Sanskrit texts, but he has “a by no means contemptible\r\npharmacopœia,” says Hunter. The rest consists of spells, fasts, and\r\nquackery.\r\n\r\nPhysicians (_Vitians_ or _Vydias_) being Sudras are not allowed to read\r\nthe sacred medical writings (_Vedas_); these are guarded with religious\r\nawe by the Brahmins; they are permitted, however, access to certain\r\ncommentaries upon the professional sacred books.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on the high position which the science and art of\r\nthe Hindus had attained in very ancient times, it is surprising that\r\nwe have apparently learned little or nothing from them in connection\r\nwith the healing art. Max Müller believes that there was an ancient\r\nindigenous Hindu astronomy and an ancient indigenous Hindu geometry.\r\nProbably the first attempt at solving the problem of the squaring of\r\nthe circle was suggested, he thinks, by the problem in the Sutras\r\nhow to construct a square altar that should be of exactly the same\r\nmagnitude as a round altar. It is scarcely conceivable that so patient\r\nand shrewd a people as the Hindus, a people at once so observant and\r\nso profoundly speculative, should not have kept pace with the other\r\nenlightened nations of the world in the study of medicine and surgery.\r\nThe vegetation of India is so rich in medicinal herbs that its _Materia\r\nMedica_ could hardly be equalled in any other country; so that both by\r\nintellect and by location the Hindus should be amongst the foremost\r\nprofessors of the art of medicine. On the contrary, however, the West\r\nhas everywhere to instruct the East in the medical sciences; and the\r\nyoung Brahmins who flock to the medical schools and universities\r\nof Europe find that they have everything to learn from us in this\r\ndirection. Is this an evidence of arrested development, a retrogression\r\nin civilization due to conservatism and a paralysis of the power to\r\nkeep pace with the world’s advance consequent on the influences of\r\nreligion and custom? Probably it is. All the medicine of the Hindus\r\nis empiricism; their systems exclude anatomy and surgery, without\r\nwhich, as Prof. H. H. Wilson observes,[278] “the whole system must\r\nbe defective.... We can easily imagine that these were not likely to\r\nhave been much cultivated in Hindustan, and that local disadvantages\r\nand religious prejudices might have proved very serious impediments to\r\ntheir acquirement.”\r\n\r\nAs compared with other ancient nations, Egypt, Chaldæa, Greece, and\r\nRome, we are at considerable disadvantage in the attempt to discover\r\nwhat was known and practised of the healing arts in the remoter ages.\r\nWe have no papyri like the “Book of the Dead” or the great medical\r\npapyrus of Ebers; we have no inscriptions on such ancient monuments as\r\nMesopotamia has preserved for us; we have no Sanskrit treatises to be\r\ncompared for their antiquity and scientific interest with those which\r\nhave come down to us from ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nMax Müller says[279] that “few Sanskrit MSS. in India are older than\r\n1000 after Christ, nor is there any evidence that the art of writing\r\nwas known in India much before the beginning of Buddhism, or the very\r\nend of the ancient Vedic literature.”\r\n\r\nThen, again, the Hindu treatises on medical subjects, whether fables or\r\nfacts, have hitherto been little noticed by Sanskrit scholars.[280]\r\n\r\nThe subject is not of general interest, and a man would need to be not\r\nonly a perfect Sanskrit scholar, but a physician as well, who should\r\nattempt such a task as the translation of these treatises in any useful\r\nmanner. Although ancient India has little to show us in the way of\r\nactual written documents and inscriptions, it must not be supposed for\r\na moment that she is deficient in ancient poetry and other works which\r\nhave been preserved through the ages by the marvellously developed\r\nmemory of her Brahmins and religious teachers. The ancient Vedic hymns,\r\nthe Brâhmanas, and probably the Sutras, were handed down from before\r\n1000 B.C. by oral tradition. Every, the minutest precaution was taken\r\nthat not a word, not a letter, not an accent even should be omitted or\r\naltered; and Max Müller tells us “this was a sacred duty, the neglect\r\nof which entailed social degradation, and the most minute rules were\r\nlaid down as to the mnemonic system that had to be followed.”\r\n\r\nThe people of India believe that small-pox is under the control of “the\r\ngoddess Mata,” in whose honour temples abound and fairs are held, where\r\nthousands of women and children attend with offerings. The declivities\r\nof most of the numerous conical hills present either a reddened\r\nstone or temple devoted to “Mata,” with most probably an attendant\r\nBrahmin priest. Nearly every village has its goddess of small-pox in\r\nthe immediate locality, and in many places a large piece of ground\r\nis esteemed holy and dedicated to “Mata.” The people do not pray to\r\nescape the affliction, unless in seasons when it occurs with more than\r\nordinary violence. They do, however, petition for a mild visitation.\r\nBut even the loss of an eye does not appear to be viewed as a very\r\nserious calamity! “Is there not another eye sufficient for all our\r\npurposes?” questioned one of these stoical philosophers. “If it were\r\nthe leg or hand, it would be different, but an eye is immaterial.”[281]\r\n\r\n“The small-pox goddess stands with two uplifted crooked daggers,\r\nthreatening to strike on the right and left. Before her are a band of\r\nexecutors of her vengeance. Two of them wear red grinning masks, carry\r\nblack shields, and brandish naked scimitars. White lines, like rays,\r\nissue from the bodies of the others, to indicate infection. On the\r\nright there is a group of men with spotted bodies, afflicted with the\r\nmalady; bells are hung at their cinctures, and a few of them wave in\r\ntheir hands black feathers. They are preceded by musicians with drums,\r\nwho are supplicating the pity of the furious deity. Behind the goddess,\r\non the right, there advances a bevy of smiling young women, who are\r\ncarrying gracefully on their heads baskets with thanksgiving-offerings,\r\nin gratitude for their lives and their beauty having been spared. There\r\nis, besides, a little boy with a bell at his girdle, who seems to be\r\nconveying something from the right arm of the goddess. This action may\r\npossibly be emblematic of inoculation.”[282]\r\n\r\nAnother small-pox deity of India described by Mr. Dubois, a\r\nmissionary,[283] is Mah-ry-Umma, who is supposed to incarnate herself\r\nin the disease. The natives, when vaccination was first introduced,\r\nobjected to the practice for fear lest the goddess should be offended,\r\nas to prevent the small-pox would imply an objection to her becoming\r\nincarnate amongst them. The difficulty was overcome by the suggestion\r\nthat the vaccination was a mild form of disease by which the goddess\r\nhad chosen to visit her votaries, so that she might be worshipped with\r\nequal respect.\r\n\r\n“Even Siva is worshipped as a stone, especially that Siva who will\r\nafflict a child with epileptic fits, and then, speaking by its voice,\r\nwill announce that he is Parchânana, the Five-faced, and is punishing\r\nthe child for insulting his image.”[284]\r\n\r\nSurgeon-General Sir W. J. Moore, in an article on “The Origin and\r\nProgress of Hospitals in India,”[285] says that we may form a very good\r\nopinion of the condition of the whole of India in ancient times by\r\nrecalling what was the state of medical relief in most of the native\r\nStates previous to the institution of medical relief and sanitation in\r\nBritish districts.\r\n\r\n“Recently, in the Native States, there might be witnessed disease\r\nproceeding unchecked and uninterfered with, to a degree which certainly\r\nwould not be allowed at present in civilized Europe. And especially\r\nwas this evident in surgical disease, as illustrated by the following\r\nextract from an official document:[286]—\r\n\r\n“‘In former reports I have mentioned the extreme ignorance displayed\r\nby native “hukeems” or “vaids” of surgical principles. As a rule,\r\nall surgical disease is either wrongly treated, or let alone until\r\ntreatment is unavailable by these uneducated practitioners. Their\r\nerrors of omission and commission are not so easily ascertained in\r\ntheir medical, as in their surgical, practice. But in the latter,\r\nthere is a glaring ignorance, not only from things requisite not being\r\nattempted, but from things unnecessary being performed, leading to the\r\nserious injury and often to the death of the patient. Thus, during my\r\nlast tour, I saw at one village, an open scrofulous sore of the neck\r\nwith the carotid artery isolated, and apparently on the point of giving\r\nway. At another village I witnessed an advanced cancer rapidly killing\r\na man. In another place a woman had remained for days with a dislocated\r\njaw, which was easily put _in situ_. Other forms of dislocation and\r\nfracture neglected are almost daily sights. At Bikaneer I amputated\r\nthe leg of a man who eight months before fell from a camel; the bones\r\nof the leg protruding through the skin of the heel, and the foot being\r\ndriven half-way up the front of the leg, _in which position it had been\r\npermitted to heal_! At the same place a woman was rapidly sinking from\r\nthe results of extensive sinus of the breast, following abscess, and\r\nwhich only required free incisions for the restoration of health. I\r\nalso saw a man dying of strangulated hernia, without the slightest idea\r\nof or attempt at relief on the part of the native practitioners. And so\r\non, throughout almost the whole range of surgery, I have from time to\r\ntime witnessed the most lamentable results from the malpractices, or\r\nfrom the absence of practice on the part of the Native Doctors.’\r\n\r\n“As mentioned in the above extract, the errors of omission and\r\ncommission are not so easily ascertained in medical as in surgical\r\ncases. But the great majority of those stricken by disease, such as\r\ninflammations and fevers, derived as little benefit from medicine as\r\ndid the Romans when, according to Pliny, physicians were banished from\r\nthe Imperial City during many years. For few indeed of the higher\r\nclass and comparatively better educated ‘hukeems’ or ‘vaids’ would\r\nminister to the poor who were unable to pay their fees; and of the\r\npopulations of India the great majority are and always were poor.\r\nSteeped in continually augmenting superstition and ignorance, if the\r\npoor received medical aid at all, it was from the hands of the equally\r\nignorant and superstitious village ‘Kabiraj,’ who, unlike their more\r\nnoble Aryan predecessors, did not even ‘draw physic from the fields,’\r\nalthough they may have used a charm, such as a peacock’s feather tied\r\nround the affected part! If the poor got well, they got well; and as\r\nmost diseases have a tendency to terminate in health, many did recover.\r\nIf a fatal termination resulted, it was attributed to _nusseeb_ or\r\ndestiny, or the gods were blamed. Insane persons, if harmless, were\r\nallowed to ramble about the streets; if violent, they were chained in\r\nthe most convenient place. The jails of the Native States were also in\r\nan unparalleled unsanitary condition, for no medical aid whatever was\r\nprovided; as Coleridge said of Coldbath Fields, these jails might have\r\ngiven His Satanic Majesty a hint for improving Hades. Fatalism combined\r\nwith ignorance, and a consequent utter unbelief in any measures of\r\nsanitation, resulted in the absence of all measures of precaution\r\nduring epidemics of contagious disease. During the prevalence of\r\nsmall-pox, children might be seen by scores, in every stage of the\r\ndisease, playing or lying about the streets. During an epidemic of\r\ncholera, not one precautionary measure was ever adopted—except by the\r\nwild Bheels, who invariably moved, leaving their villages for a time\r\nfor the open jungle; thus forestalling the most approved method of\r\npreventing cholera adopted for British troops, viz., marching away from\r\nthe infected area.\r\n\r\n“Not only were there no hospitals proper, or contagious hospitals,\r\nor asylums for the insane, but neither were there any asylums for\r\nlepers. Regarding the latter, difference of opinion would appear to\r\nhave existed among scientific investigators, then as now, as to whether\r\nleprosy is a contagious disease or not. Then as now, in some parts of\r\nthe country, lepers were permitted to live among the people; in other\r\nlocalities they were thrust out from the towns or villages, generally\r\nforming a little colony on the adjoining plain. This expulsion of\r\nlepers from the towns and villages, then as now, was not so much the\r\nresult of fear of contagion, as the Brahminical dread of contact with\r\nimpurity. Then as now, these outcasts lived miserably in mud or grass\r\nhuts, obtaining food by begging. When tired of life, or when being\r\nold or disabled their relatives were tired of keeping them, they\r\noften submitted to ‘sumajh’ or burial alive. But they more frequently\r\nthreatened to perform ‘sumajh’ with the view of extracting alms from\r\nthe charitable, who were induced to believe that the death of the\r\nleper would be credited to them, unless they bought off the sacrifice.\r\n‘Sumajh,’ or leper burial alive, has been practised comparatively\r\nrecently in more than one of the Native States.\r\n\r\n“The Native principalities are now much more advanced in most respects\r\nthan they were only a few years back. By coming into contact with\r\nthe progressive civilization of adjoining British districts, the\r\nGovernments of Native States were forced to advance; for they felt\r\ntheir existence would be imperilled. And this advance was most\r\nmaterially assisted by the successful endeavours made by the Indian\r\nGovernment to secure the better education of the young Indian princes\r\nand nobles. The Imperial Government also, and especially under Lord\r\nMayo, enunciated care for the sick as one of the most urgent duties of\r\nthe feudatory rulers of India. Owing to such measures, aided by the\r\npersonal influence of the Political, and the assistance of the Medical\r\nOfficers attached to the Native Courts, a hospital or dispensary has,\r\namongst other features of civilization, been established at every\r\nlarge capital; while in some States ramifications of such central\r\nestablishments have rendered the people almost as well off, in the\r\nmatter of medical relief, as those in British territory. As it will not\r\nbe necessary to refer again, except incidentally, to the Native States,\r\nI may here remark that all the medical institutions are supported at\r\nthe cost of the Durbar or Government of each State. They are, as a\r\nrule, superintended by the European Medical Officer attached to the\r\nPolitical Residency, aided by native assistants.\r\n\r\n“Although the recent condition of the Native States represents what\r\nformerly prevailed all over Hindustan, it must not be understood that\r\nthe people were devoid of charity; only the charity of the well-to-do\r\nclasses did not take the form of medical relief. In the absence of a\r\nqualified medical profession recognised by the State, the confidence\r\nfelt in the physic of the ‘vaids’ and ‘hukeems’ was something akin to\r\nthe faith of Byron, who without any such excuse designated medicine\r\nas ‘the destructive art of healing.’ Moreover, the organization of\r\nhospitals was not understood, and the necessary discipline of such\r\nestablishments was foreign to the habits and ideas of the people. The\r\npoor (who now throng the hospitals of India), having had no experience\r\nof the advantages of such institutions, would probably not have\r\nresorted thereto had hospitals and dispensaries been opened under\r\nnative control. So suspicious were the people on the first opening of\r\na hospital in one of the Native States, that sweetmeats, of which they\r\nare very fond, were ordered to be given daily to each patient, as an\r\nencouragement to attend! So in former times the charitable preferred\r\nspending their money in sinking wells, in constructing _serais_ or\r\nrest-houses for travellers, in endowing temples, and in feeding the\r\npoor, particularly Brahmins. In this manner, enormous sums have been\r\ndisbursed and are still expended, especially in food for the destitute.\r\nThis laudable charity of the Indians, although often confined to their\r\nown caste people, and to occasions of family festival, is one of the\r\nreasons why it has never been thought necessary to establish any system\r\nof poor-law relief in British India. Of late years native charity has\r\nbeen often directed towards building and endowing medical institutions,\r\nand many Indian gentlemen have given most liberally for such purposes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMEDICINE IN CHINA, TARTARY, AND JAPAN.\r\n\r\n Origin of Chinese Culture.—Shamanism.—Disease-Demons.—Taoism.—Medicine\r\n Gods.—Mediums.—Anatomy and Physiology of the Chinese.—Surgery.—No\r\n Hospitals in China.—Chinese Medicines.—Filial Piety.—Charms and Sacred\r\n Signs.—Medicine in Thibet, Tartary, and Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\nChief amongst the Mongolian peoples are the Chinese. Prof. Max Müller\r\nargues that the Chinese, the Thibetans, the Japanese, Coreans, and the\r\nUral-Altaic or Turanian nations are in the matter of religion closely\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\nChinese culture has recently been declared by Professor Terrien de\r\nla Couperie, François Lenormant, and Sayce to be of Accadian origin.\r\nHieratic Accadian has been identified with the first five hundred\r\nChinese characters, and it is believed by Professor de la Couperie\r\nthat the Chinese entered north-western China from Susiana, about the\r\ntwenty-third century before Christ.[287]\r\n\r\nIn the Finno-Tartarian magical mythology, we have not only the link\r\nwhich connects the religion of heathen Finland with that of Accadian\r\nChaldæa, but we discover what is of more importance in tracing the\r\norigin of the magic and medicine of the old civilizations of the world\r\nfrom a primitive and coarse cosmogony, such as we have examined in so\r\nmany savage peoples.\r\n\r\nAs it is impossible to separate the ancient medical belief of a people\r\nfrom its religious conceptions, if we admit Prof. Max Müller’s theory,\r\nwe must also hold that it embraces the medical notions of these\r\npeoples. And so we find that one of the striking characteristics of\r\nthe Mongolic religions is an extensive magic and sorcery—Shamanism.\r\nPractically the gods and heroes of the poetry of these peoples are\r\nsorcerers, and their worshippers value above everything their magical\r\npowers. Taoism, a Chinese religion of great antiquity and respect,\r\ninvolves an implicit faith in sorcery; and the Chinese and Mongolians\r\nhave degenerated Buddhism into Shamanism.[288]\r\n\r\nConfucianism is the chief religion of the Chinese. It is simply a\r\ndevelopment of the worship of ancestors, which was the aboriginal\r\nreligion of the country. All the Chinese are ancestor-worshippers, to\r\nwhatever other native religion they may belong.[289]\r\n\r\nThe pure Confucian is a true Agnostic.\r\n\r\nAlthough Chinese civilization is without doubt extremely ancient, we\r\nare unable to study it as we study that of Egypt or Chaldæa, on account\r\nof the absence of monuments or a literature older than a few centuries\r\nbefore Christ, which would give us a reliable history.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese attribute to Huang-ti (B.C. 2637) a work on medicine, which\r\nis still extant, entitled Nuy-kin, which is probably not older than the\r\nChristian era. They also attribute to the Emperor Chin-nung (B.C. 2699)\r\na catalogue of medicinal herbs.[290]\r\n\r\nThe demon theory of disease universally obtains throughout the Chinese\r\nempire. All bodily and mental disorders spring either from the air or\r\nspirits. They are sent by the gods as punishments for sins committed in\r\na previous state of existence. In a country where Buddhism is largely\r\nbelieved, it is natural to suppose that there is little sympathy with\r\nthe suffering and afflicted. One might offend the gods by getting\r\ncured, or delay the working out of the effects of the expiatory\r\nsuffering. Archdeacon Grey found a grievously afflicted monk in a\r\nmonastery in the White Cloud mountains. He desired to take him to the\r\nCanton Medical Missionary Hospital; but the abbot took him aside, and\r\nbegged him not to do so, as the sufferer had doubtless in a former\r\nstate of existence been guilty of some heinous crime, for which the\r\ngods were then making him pay the well-merited penalty.[291]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when sick, the Chinese often have recourse to some\r\ndeity, who is supposed to have caused the illness. If the patient\r\ndies, they do not blame the god, but they withhold the thank-offering\r\nwhich is customary in case of recovery. The death is declared to be in\r\naccordance with the “_reckoning of Heaven_.” If the patient recovers,\r\nthe deity of the disease gets the credit. Prayers and ceremonies are\r\nmade use of to induce the “destroying” demon to banish the baneful\r\ninfluences under his control. Sudden illness is frequently ascribed\r\nto the evil influence of one of the seventy-two malignant spirits or\r\ngods. In very urgent cases an “arrow” is obtained from an idol in the\r\ntemple. This “arrow” is about two feet long, and has a single written\r\nword, “Command,” upon it. If the patient recovers, it must be returned\r\nto the temple with a present; if he dies, an offering of mock-money\r\nis made. The “arrow” is considered as the warrant of the god for the\r\ndisease-spirit to depart.[292]\r\n\r\nIn L’ien-chow, in the province of Kwang-si, if a man hits his foot\r\nagainst a stone, and afterwards falls sick, it is at once recognised\r\nthat there was a demon in the stone; and the man’s friends accordingly\r\ngo to the place where the accident happened, and endeavour to appease\r\nthe demon with offerings of rice, wine, incense, and worship. After\r\nthis the patient recovers.[293]\r\n\r\nSometimes it is difficult to find out what particular god has been\r\noffended. Then some member of his family asks, with a stick of\r\nburning incense in his hand, that the offended deity will make known\r\nby the mouth of the patient how he has been offended. The disease is\r\nsometimes, as amongst savage nations, ascribed to the spirit of a\r\ndeceased person. The god of medicine is invited to the sick man’s house\r\nin cases where malignant sores or inflamed eyes are prevalent. Ten men\r\nsometimes become “security” for the sick person. After offerings and\r\nceremonies, the names of the ten are written upon paper, and burned\r\nbefore the idol. When a patient is likely to die, the last resort is to\r\nemploy Tauist priests to pray for him, and then the following ceremony\r\nis performed:—A bamboo, eight or ten feet long, with green leaves at\r\nthe end, is provided, and a coat belonging to the sick man is suspended\r\nwith a mirror in the place where the head of the wearer of the coat\r\nwould be. The priest repeats his incantations, to induce the sick man’s\r\nspirit to enter the coat, as it is supposed that the patient’s spirit\r\nis leaving the body or has been hovering near it. The incantations are\r\nto induce the spirit to enter the coat, so that the owner may wear both\r\ntogether. Sometimes the family will hire a Tauist priest to climb a\r\nladder of knives, and perform ceremonies for the recovery of the sick\r\nman. This is thought to have a great effect on the disease-spirits.[294]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor _Fuh-Hi_, who invented the eight diagrams, was the first\r\nphysician whose name has come down to modern times. He is one of the\r\n_Sang Huông_, or “Three Emperors,” and is the deity of doctors.\r\n\r\n_I Kuang Tāi Uông_ is the god of surgery. The people say he was a\r\nforeigner, of the Loochoo Islands, who came to the middle kingdom and\r\npractised surgery. As he was deaf whilst in the flesh, his worshippers\r\nconsider he is thus afflicted now that he is a deity, so they pray into\r\nhis ear, as well as offer him incense and candles.[295]\r\n\r\n_Ling Chui Nä_ is the goddess of midwifery and children. If children\r\nare sick, their parents employ Tauist priests in some of her temples to\r\nperform a ceremony for their cure.[296]\r\n\r\n_Iöh Uong Chû Sü_ is the god of medicine. It is said that he was a\r\ndistinguished physician who was deified after his death. He is now\r\ngenerally worshipped by dealers in drugs and by their assistants. On\r\nthe third day of the third month, they make a feast in his honour, and\r\nburn candles and incense before his image at his temple. Practising\r\nphysicians do not usually take any part in these proceedings.[297]\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have goddesses of small-pox and measles, which are\r\nextremely popular divinities. Should it thunder after the pustules of\r\nsmall-pox have appeared, a drum is beaten, to prevent them breaking.\r\nOn the fourteenth day ceremonies are performed before the goddess, to\r\ninduce her to cause the pustules to dry up.[298]\r\n\r\nMediums are often employed to prescribe for the sick. They behave\r\nprecisely as our spiritualists do, and pretend that the divinity\r\ninvoked casts himself into the medium for the time being, and dictates\r\nthe medicine which the sick person requires.[299]\r\n\r\nIn the “Texts of Táoism”[300] we are informed that “In the body there\r\nare seven precious organs, which serve to enrich the state, to give\r\nrest to the people, and to make the vital force of the system full to\r\noverflowing. Hence we have the heart, the kidneys, the breath, the\r\nblood, the brains, the semen, and the marrow. These are the seven\r\nprecious organs. They are not dispersed when the body returns (to the\r\ndust). Refined by the use of the Great Medicine, the myriad spirits all\r\nascend among the Immortals.”\r\n\r\nAnatomy and physiology have made no progress in China, because there\r\nhas never been any dissection of the body. The only books on the\r\nsubject in the Chinese language are Jesuit translations of European\r\nworks. Briefly stated, Chinese ideas on the subject are as follows:—In\r\nthe human body there are six chief organs in which “moisture” is\r\nlocated—the heart, liver, two kidneys, spleen, and lungs. There are\r\nsix others in which “warmth” abides—the small and large intestine, the\r\ngall bladder, the stomach, and the urinary apparatus. They reckon 365\r\nbones in the whole body, eight in the male and six in the female skull,\r\ntwelve ribs in men and fourteen in women. They term the bile the seat\r\nof courage; the spleen, the seat of reason; the liver, the granary of\r\nthe soul; the stomach, the resting-place of the mind.\r\n\r\nA familiar drug in Chinese materia medica, which is sold in all the\r\ndrug-shops, is the Kou-Kouo, or bean of St. Ignatius. The horny\r\nvegetable is used, after bruising and macerating, in cold water,\r\nto which it communicates a strong bitter taste. “This water,” says\r\nM. Huc,[301] “taken inwardly, modifies the heat of the blood, and\r\nextinguishes internal inflammation. It is an excellent specific for all\r\nsorts of wounds and contusions.... The veterinary doctors also apply\r\nit with great success to the internal diseases of cattle and sheep. In\r\nthe north of China we have often witnessed the salutary effects of the\r\nKou-Kouo.”\r\n\r\nThis bean is the seed of _Strychnos Ignatia_, and the plant is\r\nindigenous to the Philippine Islands. The action and uses of ignatia\r\nare identical, says Stillé, with those of nux vomica.[302]\r\n\r\nThe medical profession is a very crowded one in China, as it is\r\nperfectly free to any who choose to practise it. No diploma or\r\ncertificate of any kind is necessary in order to practise medicine\r\nin China. The majority of the regular practitioners, if such they\r\ncan be called, are men who have failed to pass their examinations as\r\nliterates. There is one, and apparently only one, check on quackery.\r\nThe Chinese have a special place in their second hell which is reserved\r\nfor ignorant physicians who will persist in doctoring sick folk. In\r\nthe fourth hell are found physicians who have used bad drugs, and\r\nin the seventh hell are tortured those who have taken human bones\r\nfrom cemeteries to make into medicines. In the very lowest hell are\r\nphysicians who have misused their art for criminal purposes. These evil\r\npersons are ceaselessly gored by sows.[303]\r\n\r\nNaturally, the sciences of anatomy and physiology are entirely\r\nneglected by these self-constituted native doctors. All the learning\r\nthey require is the ability to copy out prescriptions from a medical\r\nbook. Dr. Gould, a physician of long experience in China, tells us that\r\nthe native physician is depicted in Chinese primers as a person between\r\nthe heathen priest and the fortune-teller—his profession is looked upon\r\nas a combination of superstition and legerdemain.[304]\r\n\r\nThe court physicians at Pekin are of a much superior class, and are\r\ncompelled to pass examinations before their appointment.\r\n\r\nAstrology, charms, amulets, and characts enter largely into Chinese\r\nmedical practice. The priests keep bundles of paper charms ready for\r\nemergencies. They are supposed to know which of the different methods\r\nof using them are most appropriate to each case. Masks are used by\r\nchildren at certain times to ward off the deity of small-pox. The\r\nmasks are very ugly, as the deity is believed only to afflict pretty\r\nchildren.[305]\r\n\r\n“Isaac Vossius,” says Southey, “commended the skill of the Chinese\r\nphysicians in finding out by their touch, not only that the body is\r\ndiseased (which, he said, was all that our practitioners knew by it),\r\nbut also from what cause or what part the sickness proceeds. To make\r\nourselves masters of this skill, he would have us explore the nature of\r\nmen’s pulses, till they became as well known and as familiar to us as a\r\nharp or lute is to the players thereon; it not being enough for them to\r\nknow that there is something amiss which spoils the tune, but they must\r\nalso know what string it is which causes that fault.”[306]\r\n\r\nSurgery has never made much progress in China; the Chinese have too\r\nmuch respect for the dead to employ corpses for anatomical purposes,\r\nand they have the greatest unwillingness to draw blood or perform any\r\nkind of operation on the living. Their ideas of the structure of the\r\nhuman frame are therefore purely fanciful. “The distinctive Chinese\r\nsurgical invention is acupuncture, or the insertion of fine needles of\r\nhardened silver or gold for an inch or more (with a twisting motion)\r\ninto the seats of pain or inflammation.”[307] Rheumatism and gout\r\nare thus treated, and 367 points are specified where needles may be\r\ninserted without injury to great vessels or vital organs.\r\n\r\nDentistry and ophthalmic surgery are practised by specialists.\r\n\r\nThere are no hospitals; the Chinese consider it would be a neglect\r\nof the duty which they owe to their relatives to send them when sick\r\nto such institutions. Chinese doctors often receive a fixed salary\r\nso long as their patient remains in good health; when he falls sick,\r\nthe pay is stopped till he gets well. The doctor must ask his patient\r\nno questions, nor does the patient volunteer any information about\r\nhis case. Having felt the sick man’s pulse, looked at his tongue, and\r\notherwise observed him, he is supposed to have completed his diagnosis,\r\nand must prescribe accordingly. Some of the Chinese prescriptions are\r\nvery costly; precious stones and jewels are often powdered up with\r\nmusk and made into pills, which are considered specifics for small-pox\r\nand fevers. Another remedy is _Kiuchiu_, a bitter wine made of spirit,\r\naloes, myrrh, frankincense, and saffron, which is said to be a powerful\r\ntonic. The profession of medicine is hereditary, receiving very few\r\nrecruits from outside; hence its complete stagnation.[308]\r\n\r\nOne of the industries of the Foo-Chow beggars is the rearing of\r\nsnakes, which are used by the druggists to prepare their medicines.\r\nSnake-wine is used as a febrifuge, and snake’s flesh is considered a\r\nnutritious diet for invalids. Skulls, paws, horns, and skins of many\r\nanimals, as bears, bats, crocodiles and tigers, are used in medicine.\r\nFor fever patients physicians prescribe a decoction of scorpions,\r\nwhile dysentery is treated by acupuncture of the tongue. Pigeon’s dung\r\nis the favourite medicine for women in pregnancy; and the water in\r\nwhich cockles have been boiled is prescribed for skin diseases, and\r\nfor persons who are recovering from small-pox. Rat’s flesh is eaten\r\nas a hair-restorer, and human milk is given to aged persons as a\r\nrestorative. Crab’s liver administered in decoction of pine shavings\r\nis used in a form of skin disease. In Gordon Cumming’s _Wanderings in\r\nChina_, from which many of the above facts are taken, it is stated that\r\n“dried red-spotted lizard, silk-worm moth, parasite of mulberry trees,\r\nasses’s glue, tops of hartshorn, black-lead, white-lead, stalactite,\r\nasbestos, tortoise-shell, stag-horns and bones, dog’s flesh and ferns\r\nare all recommended as tonics.” Burnt straw, oyster shells, gold\r\nand silver leaf, and the bones and tusks of dragons are said to be\r\nastringent. These dragons’ bones are the fossil remains of extinct\r\nanimals. Some of the medicines of standard Chinese works are selected\r\npurely on account of their loathsomeness, such as the ordure of all\r\nsorts of animals, from man down to goats, rabbits, and silk-worm, dried\r\nleeches, human blood, dried toads, shed skins of snakes, centipedes,\r\ntiger’s blood, and other horrors innumerable hold a conspicuous place\r\nin the Chinese pharmacopœia. Nor, says Gordon Cumming, are these the\r\nworst. The physicians say that some diseases are incurable save by a\r\nbroth made of human flesh cut from the arm or thigh of a living son or\r\ndaughter of the patient.[309]\r\n\r\nThe same author tells us that a young girl who so mutilated herself\r\nto save her mother’s life was specially commended in the _Official\r\nGazette_ of Peking for July 5th, 1870.\r\n\r\nMedicines prepared from the eyes and vitals of the dead are supposed\r\nto be efficacious. Leprosy is believed to be curable by drinking the\r\nblood of a healthy infant. Dr. Macarthy and Staff-Surgeon Rennie were\r\npresent at an execution in Peking, when they saw the executioner soak\r\nup the blood of the decapitated criminal with large balls of pith,\r\nwhich he preserved. These are dried and sold to the druggists under\r\nthe name of “shue-man-tou” (blood-bread), which is prescribed for a\r\ndisease called “chong-cheng,” which Dr. Rennie supposed to be pulmonary\r\nconsumption.[310]\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ says (October 10th, 1892) that the character of the\r\naccusations made in the publications against Europeans has created as\r\nmuch astonishment amongst the foreign residents in China as it has in\r\nthe West. Missionaries especially were charged—and the charges have\r\nbeen made frequently during the past thirty years—with bewitching women\r\nand children by means of drugs, enticing them to some secret place, and\r\nthere killing them for the purpose of taking out their hearts and eyes.\r\nDr. Macgowan, a gentleman who has lived for many years in China, has\r\npublished a statement showing that from the point of view of Chinese\r\nmedicine these accusations are far from preposterous. It is one of the\r\nmedical superstitions of China that various portions of the human frame\r\nand all its secretions possess therapeutic properties. He refers to a\r\npopular voluminous Materia Medica—the only authoritative work of the\r\nkind in the Chinese language—which gives thirty-seven anthropophagous\r\nremedies of native medicine. Human blood taken into the system from\r\nanother is believed to strengthen it; and Dr. Macgowan mentions the\r\ncase of an English lady, now dead, who devoted her fortune and life\r\nto the education of girls in Ningpo, who was supposed by the natives\r\nto extract the blood of her pupils for this purpose. Human muscles\r\nare supposed to be a good medicament in consumption, and cases are\r\nconstantly recorded of children who mutilate themselves to administer\r\ntheir flesh to sick parents.\r\n\r\nNever, says Dr. Macgowan, has filial piety exhibited its zeal in this\r\nmanner more than at the present time. Imperial decrees published in\r\nthe _Pekin Gazette_, often authorising honorary portals to be erected\r\nin honour of men, and particularly women, for these flesh offerings,\r\nafford no indication of the extent to which it is carried, for only\r\npeople of wealth and influence can obtain such a recognition of the\r\nmerit of filial devotion. It is very common among the comparatively\r\nlowly, but more frequent among the _literati_. A literary graduate\r\nnow in his own service, finding the operation of snipping a piece of\r\nintegument from his arm too painful, seized a hatchet and cut off\r\na joint of one of his fingers, which he made into broth mixed with\r\nmedicine and gave to his mother. It is essential in all such cases that\r\nthe recipient should be kept in profound ignorance of the nature of the\r\npotion thus prepared, and in no case is the operation to be performed\r\nfor an inferior, as by a husband for a wife, or a parent for a child.\r\nThis belief in the medical virtues of part of the human body (of which\r\na large number of instances which cannot be repeated here are given)\r\nhas led to a demand from native practitioners which can sometimes only\r\nbe supplied by murder. Of this, too, examples are given from official\r\nrecords and other publications, some of them of quite recent date.\r\n\r\nDr. Macgowan reminds us that men capable of these atrocities have been\r\nfound in other civilized lands. He says:—\r\n\r\n“It was in a model Occidental city, not inaptly styled the ‘Modern\r\nAthens,’ that subjects were procured for the dissecting-room through\r\nmurder, at about the same amount of money as that paid in China\r\nfor sets of eyes and hearts for medicine. A remedy was found which\r\npromptly suppressed that exceptional crime in the West. In China murder\r\nof this nature can also be prevented, but not speedily. Time is an\r\nindispensable factor in effecting the suppression of homicide, which\r\nis the outcome of medical superstition. That superstition is strongly\r\nintrenched in an official work, the most common book, after the\r\nclassics, in the empire. So long as the concluding chapter is retained\r\nin the materia medica, it will be futile to undertake the abolition\r\nof murder for medical purposes; and so long as these abhorrent crimes\r\nprevail in China, so long will fomenters of riots against foreigners\r\naim to make it appear that the men and women from afar are addicted\r\nto that form of murder, and thus precious lives will continue to be\r\nexposed to forfeiture.”\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated drug in Chinese Materia Medica is ginseng, the root\r\nof a species of _Panax_, belonging to the natural order _Araliacæ_. The\r\nmost esteemed variety is found in Corea; an inferior kind comes from\r\nthe United States, the _Panax quinquefolium_, and is often substituted\r\nfor the real article. All the Chinese ginseng is Imperial property,\r\nand is sold at its weight in gold. The peculiar shape of the root,\r\nlike the body of man—a peculiarity which it shares with mandrake and\r\nsome other plants—led to its employment in cases where virile power\r\nfails, as in the aged and debilitated. Special kinds have been sold\r\nat the enormous sum of 300 to 400 dollars the ounce. Europeans have\r\nhitherto failed, says the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, to discover any\r\nwonderful properties in the drug. It is no doubt a remarkable instance\r\nof the doctrine of signatures (_q.v._). In all cases of severe disease,\r\ndebility, etc., the Chinese fly to this remedy, so that enormous\r\nquantities are used. The Hon. H. N. Shore, R.N., says that the export\r\nfrom New-Chang in Manchuria to the Chinese ports of this article for\r\none year alone reached the value of £51,000. It seems to be simply a\r\nmild tonic, very much like gentian root. Some of the pharmacies are on\r\na very large scale; six hundred and fifty various kinds of leaves are\r\ncommonly kept for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\nWhen a Chinese physician is not able to procure the medicines he needs,\r\nhe writes the names of the drugs he desires to employ on a piece of\r\npaper, and makes the patient swallow it; the effect is supposed to\r\nbe quite as good as that of the remedy itself, and certainly in many\r\ncases it would be infinitely more pleasant to take! This custom of\r\nswallowing charms is seen again in the sick-room, some of the charms\r\nwhich are stuck round it being occasionally taken down, burned, and\r\nmixed with water, which the patient has to drink. Gongs are beaten and\r\nfire-crackers let off to frighten away the demons which are supposed to\r\nbe tormenting the sick person.\r\n\r\n“The superstition as to the powers of the ‘evil eye,’” says Denny,[311]\r\n“may almost be deemed fundamental to humanity, as I have yet to read\r\nof a people amongst whom it does not find some degree of credence.”\r\nIn China a pregnant woman, or a man whose wife is pregnant, is called\r\n“four-eyed”; and children are guarded against being looked at by\r\neither, as it would probably cause sickness to attack them.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest diagrams to be met with in China is the mystic\r\n_svastika_, or “Thor’s Hammer” 卍. It is found on the wrappers of\r\nmedicines, and is accepted as the accumulation of lucky signs\r\npossessing ten thousand virtues.[312]\r\n\r\nThe physicians of Thibet, says M. Huc,[313] assign to the human body\r\nfour hundred and forty diseases, neither more nor less. Lamas who\r\npractise medicine have to learn by heart the books which treat of these\r\ndiseases, their symptoms, and the method of curing them. The books\r\nare a mere hotch-potch of aphorisms and recipes. The Lama doctors\r\nhave less horror of blood than the Chinese, and practise bleeding and\r\ncupping. They pay great attention to the examination of a patient’s\r\nwater. A thoroughly competent Lama physician must be able to diagnose\r\nthe disease and treat the patient without seeing him. It is sufficient\r\nthat he make a careful examination of the water. This he does not by\r\nchemical tests, as in Western nations, but by whipping it up with\r\na wooden knife and listening to the noise made by the bubbles. A\r\npatient’s water is mute or crackling according to his state of health.\r\nMuch of Chinese and Tartar medicine is mere superstition. “Yet,” says\r\nM. Huc very judiciously, “notwithstanding all this quackery, there is\r\nno doubt that they possess an infinite number of very valuable recipes,\r\nthe result of long experience. It were perhaps rash to imagine that\r\nmedical science has nothing to learn from the Tartar, Thibetian, and\r\nChinese physicians, on the pretext that they are not acquainted with\r\nthe structure and mechanism of the human body. They may, nevertheless,\r\nbe in possession of very important secrets, which science alone, no\r\ndoubt, is capable of explaining, but which, very possibly, science\r\nitself may never discover. Without being scientific, a man may very\r\nwell light upon extremely scientific results.” The fact that everybody\r\nin China and Tartary can make gunpowder, while probably none of the\r\nmakers can chemically explain its composition and action is a proof of\r\nthis fact.\r\n\r\nM. Huc says that every Mongol knows the name and position of all the\r\nbones which compose the frame of animals. They are exceedingly skilful\r\nanatomists, and are well acquainted with the diseases of animals, and\r\nthe best means of curing them. They administer medicines to beasts by\r\nmeans of a cow-horn used as a funnel, and even employ enemas in their\r\ndiseases. The cow-horn serves for the pipe, and a bladder fixed on\r\nthe wide end acts as a pump when squeezed. They make punctures and\r\nincisions in various parts of the body of animals. Although their skill\r\nas anatomists and veterinary surgeons is so great, they have only the\r\nsimplest and rudest tools wherewith to exercise this art.\r\n\r\n“Medicine in Tartary,” says M. Huc,[314] “is exclusively practised\r\nby the Lamas. When illness attacks any one, his friends run to the\r\nnearest monastery for a Lama, whose first proceeding, upon visiting\r\nthe patient, is to run his fingers over the pulse of both wrists\r\nsimultaneously, as the fingers of a musician run over the strings of\r\nan instrument. The Chinese physicians feel both pulses also, but in\r\nsuccession. After due deliberation, the Lama pronounces his opinion\r\nas to the particular nature of the malady. According to the religious\r\nbelief of the Tartars, all illness is owing to the visitation of a\r\nTchutgour, or demon; but the expulsion of the demon is first a matter\r\nof medicine. The Lama physician next proceeds, as Lama apothecary, to\r\ngive the specific befitting the case; the Tartar pharmacopœia rejecting\r\nall mineral chemistry, the Lama remedies consist entirely of vegetables\r\npulverised, and either infused in water or made up into pills. If the\r\nLama doctor happens not to have any medicine with him, he is by no\r\nmeans disconcerted; he writes the names of the remedies upon little\r\nscraps of paper, moistens the paper with his saliva, and rolls them\r\nup into pills, which the patient tosses down with the same perfect\r\nconfidence as though they were genuine medicaments. To swallow the name\r\nof a remedy, or the remedy itself, say the Tartars, comes to precisely\r\nthe same thing.\r\n\r\n“The medical assault of the usurping demon being applied, the Lama next\r\nproceeds to spiritual artillery, in the form of prayers, adapted to the\r\nquality of the demon who has to be dislodged. If the patient is poor,\r\nthe Tchutgour visiting him can evidently only be an inferior Tchutgour,\r\nrequiring merely a brief, offhand prayer, sometimes merely an\r\ninterjectional exorcism. If the patient is very poor, the Lama troubles\r\nhimself with neither prayer nor pill, but goes away, recommending the\r\nfriends to wait with patience until the sick patient gets better or\r\ndies, according to the decree of Hormoustha. But where the patient is\r\nrich, the possessor of large flocks, the proceedings are altogether\r\ndifferent. First it is obvious that a devil who presumes to visit so\r\neminent a personage must be a potent devil, one of the chiefs of the\r\nlower world; and it would not be decent for a great Tchutgour to travel\r\nlike a mere sprite; the family, accordingly, are directed to prepare\r\nfor him a handsome suit of clothes, a pair of rich boots, a fine horse,\r\nready saddled and bridled, otherwise the devil will never think of\r\ngoing, physic or exorcise him how you may. It is even possible, indeed,\r\nthat one horse will not suffice; for the demon, in very rich cases, may\r\nturn out upon inquiry to be so high and mighty a prince, that he has\r\nwith him a number of courtiers and attendants, all of whom have to be\r\nprovided with horses.\r\n\r\n“Everything being arranged, the ceremony commences. The Lama and\r\nnumerous co-physicians called in from his own and other adjacent\r\nmonasteries, offer up prayers in the rich man’s tents for a week or\r\na fortnight, until they perceive that the devil is gone,—that is to\r\nsay, until they have exhausted all the disposable tea and sheep. If\r\nthe patient recovers, it is a clear proof that the prayers have been\r\nefficaciously recited; if he dies, it is a still greater proof of the\r\nefficaciousness of the prayers, for not only is the devil gone, but\r\nthe patient has transmigrated to a state far better than that he has\r\nquitted.\r\n\r\n“The prayers recited by the Lamas for the recovery of the sick are\r\nsometimes accompanied with very dismal and alarming rites. The aunt of\r\nTokoura, chief of an encampment in the Valley of Dark Waters, visited\r\nby M. Huc, was seized one evening with an intermittent fever. ‘I would\r\ninvite the attendance of the doctor Lama,’ said Tokoura, ‘but if he\r\nfinds there is a very big Tchutgour present, the expenses will ruin\r\nme.’ He waited for some days, but as his aunt grew worse and worse, he\r\nat last sent for a Lama; his anticipations were confirmed. The Lama\r\npronounced that a demon of considerable rank was present, and that no\r\ntime must be lost in expelling him. Eight other Lamas were forthwith\r\ncalled in, who at once set about the construction in dried herbs of a\r\ngreat puppet, which they entitled the Demon of Intermittent Fever, and\r\nwhich, when completed, they placed on its legs by means of a stick, in\r\nthe patient’s tent.\r\n\r\n“The ceremony began at eleven o’clock at night; the Lamas ranged\r\nthemselves in a semicircle round the upper portion of the tent with\r\ncymbals, sea-shells, bells, tambourines, and other instruments of the\r\nnoisy Tartar music. The remainder of the circle was completed by the\r\nmembers of the family squatting on the ground close to one another, the\r\npatient kneeling, or rather crouched on her heels, opposite the Demon\r\nof Intermittent Fever. The Lama doctor in chief had before him a large\r\ncopper basin filled with millet, and some little images made of paste.\r\nThe dung-fuel threw amid much smoke a fantastic and quivering light\r\nover the strange scene. Upon a given signal, the clerical orchestra\r\nexecuted an overture harsh enough to frighten Satan himself, the lay\r\ncongregation beating time with their hands to the charivari of clanging\r\ninstruments and ear-splitting voices. The diabolical concert over,\r\nthe Grand Lama opened the Book of Exorcisms, which he rested on his\r\nknees. As he chanted one of the forms, he took from the basin from time\r\nto time a handful of millet, which he threw east, west, north, and\r\nsouth, according to the Rubric. The tones of his voice as he prayed\r\nwere sometimes mournful and suppressed, sometimes vehemently loud\r\nand energetic. All of a sudden he would quit the regular cadence of\r\nprayer, and have an outburst of apparently indomitable rage, abusing\r\nthe herb puppet with fierce invectives and furious gestures. The\r\nexorcism terminated, he gave a signal by stretching out his arms right\r\nand left, and the other Lamas struck up a tremendously noisy chorus\r\nin hurried, dashing tones. All the instruments were set to work, and\r\nmeantime the lay congregation, having started up with one accord, ran\r\nout of the tent one after the other, and tearing round it like mad\r\npeople, beat it at their hardest with sticks, yelling all the while at\r\nthe pitch of their voices in a manner to make ordinary hair stand on\r\nend. Having thrice performed this demoniac round, they re-entered the\r\ntent as precipitately as they had quitted it, and resumed their seats.\r\nThen, all the others covering their faces with their hands, the Grand\r\nLama rose and set fire to the herb figure. As soon as the flames rose\r\nhe uttered a loud cry, which was repeated with interest by the rest of\r\nthe company. The laity immediately arose, seized the burning figure,\r\ncarried it into the plain, away from the tents, and there, as it\r\nconsumed, anathematized it with all sorts of imprecations; the Lamas,\r\nmeantime, squatted in the tent, tranquilly chanting their prayers in a\r\ngrave, solemn tone. Upon the return of the family from their valorous\r\nexpedition, the praying was exchanged for joyous felicitations.\r\nBy-and-by each person provided with a lighted torch, the whole party\r\nrushed simultaneously from the tent, and formed into a procession, the\r\nlaymen first, then the patient, supported on either side by a member\r\nof the family, and lastly, the nine Lamas, making night hideous with\r\ntheir music. In this style the patient was conducted to another tent,\r\npursuant to the orders of the Lama, who declared she must absent\r\nherself from her own habitation for an entire month.\r\n\r\n“After this strange treatment the malady did not return. The\r\nprobability is that the Lamas, having ascertained the precise moment\r\nat which the fever-fit would recur, met it at the exact point of time\r\nby this tremendous counter-excitement and overcame it.\r\n\r\n“Though the majority of the Lamas seek to foster the ignorant credulity\r\nof the Tartars, in order to turn it to their own profit, we have met\r\nsome of them who frankly avowed that duplicity and imposture played\r\nconsiderable part in all their ceremonies. The superior of a Lamasery\r\nsaid to us one day, ‘When a person is ill the recitation of prayers is\r\nproper, for Buddha is the master of life and death; it is he who rules\r\nthe transmigration of beings. To take remedies is also fitting, for the\r\ngreat virtue of medicinal herbs also comes to us from Buddha. That the\r\nEvil One may possess a rich person is credible; but that in order to\r\nrepel the Evil One, the way is to give him dress, and a horse, and what\r\nnot, this is a fiction invented by ignorant and deceiving Lamas, who\r\ndesire to accumulate wealth at the expense of their brothers.’”\r\n\r\nM. Huc describes a grand solemnity he witnessed in Tartary, when a\r\nLama Boktè cut himself open, took out his entrails, placed them before\r\nhim, and then after returning them, closed the wound while the blood\r\nflowed in every direction; yet he was apparently as well as before\r\nthe operation, with the exception of extreme prostration. Good Lamas,\r\nsays M. Huc, abhor such diabolical miracles; it is only those of bad\r\ncharacter who perform them. The good priest describes several other\r\n“supernaturalisms,” as he calls them, of a similar kind, which are\r\nfrequently performed by the Lamas. He sets them all down to diabolical\r\nagency.[315]\r\n\r\nThe Turanian nations have their priests of magic, says M. Maury,[316]\r\nwho exercise great power over the people. He thinks this is partly due\r\nto the pains they take to look savage and imposing, but still more to\r\nthe over-excited condition in which they are kept by the rites to which\r\nthey have recourse; they take stimulants and probably drugs to cause\r\nhallucinations, convulsions, and dreams, for they are the dupes of\r\ntheir own delirium.\r\n\r\n“Amongst all nations,” says Castrèn, “of whatever race, disease is\r\nalways regarded as a possession, and as the work of a demon.”[317]\r\n\r\nSays M. Maury: “The Baschkirs have their Shaitan-kuriazi, who expel\r\ndevils, and undertake to treat the invalids regarded as possessed by\r\nmeans of the administration of certain remedies. This Shaitan, whose\r\nname has been borrowed from the Satan of the Christians, since the\r\nBaschkirs have come into contact with the Russians, is held by the\r\nKalmuks to be the chief author of all our bodily sufferings. If they\r\nwish to expel him, they must resort not only to conjurations, but also\r\nto cunning. The aleyss places his offerings before the sick man, as if\r\nthey were intended for the wicked spirit; it being supposed that the\r\ndemon, attracted by their number or their value, will leave the body\r\nwhich he is tormenting in order to seize upon the new spoil. According\r\nto the Tcheremisses, the souls of the dead come to trouble the living,\r\nand in order to prevent them from doing so, they pierce the soles of\r\nthe feet, and also the heart of the deceased, thinking that, being\r\nthen nailed into their tomb, the dead could not possibly leave it....\r\nThe Kirghis tribes apply to their sorcerers, or _Baksy_, to chase away\r\ndemons, and then to cure the diseases they are supposed to produce. To\r\nthis end they whip the invalid until the blood comes, and then spit\r\nin his face. In their eyes every disease is a personal being. This\r\nidea is so generally received amongst the Tchuvaches also, that they\r\nfirmly believe the least omission of duty is punished by some disease\r\nsent to them by Tchemen, a demon whose name is only an altered form of\r\nShaitan. An opinion strongly resembling this is found again amongst the\r\nTchuktchis; these savages have recourse to the strangest conjurations\r\nto free from disease; their Shamans are also subject to nervous states,\r\nwhich they bring on by an artificial excitement.”[318]\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPANESE MEDICINE.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, as early as 218 B.C., found their way amongst the Japanese\r\ndoctors with medical books, dating back, it is alleged, to 2737 B.C.,\r\nand the influence of Chinese medicine upon Japanese medicine has\r\ncontinued to be a controlling one up to the recent introduction of\r\nEuropean medicines now in vogue. The old style of things is, according\r\nto Dr. Benjamin Howard, still followed by 30,000 out of the 41,000\r\nphysicians now practising throughout the Empire. Of the 30,000 of the\r\nold vernacular school, one of them is still on the list of the Court\r\nphysicians, and maintains a high reputation. The impression throughout\r\nEurope that coloured papers, exorcisms, etc., are the basis of Chinese\r\nand Japanese medicine is erroneous. Dr. Howard has seen nearly 2,000\r\nbooks by these people, covering most of the departments of medicine,\r\nbut amongst which materia medica occupies the leading place. In these\r\nbooks are the doctrines of the successive schools, strikingly like some\r\nof those which in past centuries existed amongst our own ancestors. The\r\nsuccessive medical colleges have always had a professor of astrology,\r\nbut the solid fact remains that the materia medica has included\r\namongst its several hundred remedies a large number of those used by\r\nourselves, and these are not only vegetable, but animal and mineral,\r\nin the latter class mercury being prominent. Surgery became a separate\r\nbranch as long since as the seventh or eighth century.[319]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE MEDICINE OF THE PARSEES.\r\n\r\n Zoroaster and the _Zend-Avesta_.—The Heavenly Gift of the Healing\r\n Plants.—Ormuzd and Ahriman.—Practice of the Healing Art and its Fees.\r\n\r\n\r\nZoroaster, or more correctly Zarathustra, was the founder, or at least\r\nthe reformer of the Magian religion, and one of the greatest teachers\r\nof the East. The date of Zoroaster is involved in obscurity, but all\r\nclassical antiquity agrees that he was an historical person. Neither\r\ndo we know his birthplace. Duncker gives 1000 B.C. as his period;\r\nothers consider that he was possibly a contemporary of Moses. In\r\nthe _Zend-Avesta_ and the records of the Parsees he is said to have\r\nlived in the reign of Vitaçpa or Gushtap, whom most writers recognise\r\nas Darius Hystaspis. Pliny notices works of Zoroaster treating of\r\nNature and of precious stones. He is credited with the invention of\r\nmagic; and as ancient medicine was closely connected with magic,\r\nwe may, in this sense, consider him as a physician. Aristotle and\r\nEudoxus stated that he lived six thousand years before Plato. It is\r\nhopeless, however, to attempt to settle a question so involved in\r\nobscurity. The most characteristic feature of Zoroaster’s teaching is\r\nthe dualistic conception of the scheme of the universe, according to\r\nwhich two powers—a good and an evil—are for ever contending for the\r\nmastery—Ormuzd against Ahriman. Ormuzd is of the light, and from this\r\nemanate the good spirits whose laws are executed by Izeds, who are\r\nangels and archangels.\r\n\r\nAhriman is of the darkness, and from this emanate Daêvas, powers by\r\nwhom mankind are led to their destruction—evil powers, false gods,\r\ndevils. From these Daêvas proceed all the evil which is in the world;\r\nthey are agents of that higher evil principle Druj, or falsehood and\r\ndeception, which is called Ahriman, the spirit enemy. These Daêvas send\r\nto men, and are the causes of all diseases, which can only be cured by\r\nthe good spirits. Man belongs either to Ormuzd or to Ahriman according\r\nto his deeds. If he offers sacrifice to Ormuzd and the gods, and helps\r\nthem by good thoughts, good deeds, and spreads life over the world and\r\nopposes Ahriman by destroying evil, then he is a man of Asha, who\r\ndrives away fiends and diseases by spells. He who does the contrary to\r\nthis is a Dravant,—“demon,” a foe of Asha. The man of Ormuzd will have\r\na seat near him in heaven.[320]\r\n\r\nAccording to the _Zend-Avesta_ Thrita was the first physician who drove\r\nback death and disease. Ormuzd (Ahura Mazda) brought him down from\r\nheaven ten thousand healing plants which had grown around the tree of\r\neternal life, which is the white Haoma (the Indian Soma), or Gaokerena,\r\nwhich grows in the middle of the sea, Vouru-kasha. These are the\r\nHaomas, says Darmesteter.[321]\r\n\r\nOne is the yellow, or earthly Haoma, and is the king of healing-plants;\r\nthe other, or white, is that which, on the day of resurrection, will\r\nmake men immortal. Thrita was one of the first priests of Haoma,\r\nthe life and health-giving plant, and thus he obtained his skill in\r\nmedicine. Darmesteter says that Thrita was originally the same as\r\nThraêtaona of the _Rig-Veda_.[322]\r\n\r\n“We see that Thraêtaona fulfilled the same functions as Thrita.\r\nAccording to Hamza he was the inventor of medicine. The Tavids\r\n(formulas of exorcism) against sickness are inscribed with his name,\r\nand we find in the Avesta itself the Fravashi of Thraêtaona invoked\r\n‘against itch, hot fever, humours, cold fever, vâvareshi; against\r\nthe plagues created by the serpent.’ We learn from this passage that\r\ndisease was understood as coming from the serpent; in other words,\r\nthat it was considered a sort of poisoning, and this is the reason why\r\nthe killer of the serpent was invoked to act against it. Thus Thrita\r\nThraêtaona had a double right to the title of the first of the healers,\r\nboth as a priest of Haoma and as the conqueror of the serpent.”\r\n\r\nOrmuzd (Ahura Mazda) said that Thrita “asked for a source of\r\nremedies—he obtained it from Khshathia-Vaivya”—to withstand the\r\ndiseases and infection which Angra-Mainyu had created by his\r\nwitchcraft. As Ahriman had created ten thousand diseases, so Ormuzd\r\ngave mankind the same number of healing plants. This idea is firmly\r\nfixed in the minds of every one of us to this day: for every disease\r\nthere must of necessity somewhere be a remedy, and that usually with\r\nthe common people is supposed to be a plant. The Soma is the king\r\nof the healing plants in India and that also came down from heaven.\r\n“Whilst coming down from heaven the plants said, ‘He will never suffer\r\nany wound the mortal whom we touch.’”[323]\r\n\r\nOrmuzd, having given man the healing plants, said: “To thee, O\r\nSickness, I say, avaunt! To thee, O Death, I say, avaunt! To thee,\r\nO Pain, I say, avaunt! To thee, O Fever, I say, avaunt! To thee, O\r\nDisease, I say, avaunt!”[324]\r\n\r\nIn the Vendîdâd (Fargard vii. _a_)[325] it is demanded, “If a\r\nworshipper of Mazda want to practise the art of healing, on whom shall\r\nhe first prove his skill? On worshippers of Mazda or on worshippers of\r\nthe Daêvas?”\r\n\r\nAhura Mazda answered: “On worshippers of the Daêvas shall he first\r\nprove himself, rather than on worshippers of Mazda. If he treat with\r\nthe knife a worshipper of the Daêvas, and he die; if he treat with\r\nthe knife a second worshipper of the Daêvas, and he die; if he treat\r\nwith the knife for the third time a worshipper of the Daêvas, and he\r\ndie, he is unfit to practise the art of healing for ever and ever.\r\nLet him therefore never attend any worshipper of Mazda; let him never\r\ntreat with the knife any worshipper of Mazda, nor wound him with the\r\nknife. If he shall ever attend any worshipper of Mazda; if he shall\r\never treat with the knife any worshipper of Mazda, and wound him with\r\nthe knife, he shall pay for it the same penalty as is paid for wilful\r\nmurder. If he treat with the knife a worshipper of the Daêvas, and\r\nhe recover; if he treat with the knife a second worshipper of the\r\nDaêvas, and he recover; if for the third time he treat with the knife\r\na worshipper of the Daêvas, and he recover, then he is fit to practise\r\nthe art of healing for ever and ever. He may henceforth at his will\r\nattend worshippers of Mazda; he may at his will treat with the knife\r\nworshippers of Mazda, and heal them with the knife.”\r\n\r\nNaturally, the rising surgeons would seek their clinical material\r\namongst the heretics.\r\n\r\nWe learn from the _Zend-Avesta_ that the doctrine of Zoroaster teaches\r\nthat not only real death makes one unclean, but partial death also.\r\nThe demon claims as his property everything which goes out of the body\r\nof man, and that because it is dead. The breath which leaves the mouth\r\nis unclean, so that fire, which is sacred, must not be blown with it.\r\nNail parings and cuttings of the hair are unclean, and unless protected\r\nby spells are likely to become the weapons of the demons. Whatever\r\naltered the body in its nature was demon’s work. On this principle the\r\nmenstruation of women causes their uncleanness. The menses are sent by\r\nAhriman; the woman is possessed by a demon while they last; she has to\r\nbe kept apart; she cannot even receive food from hand to hand; she may\r\nnot eat much lest she feed the demon. So utterly unclean is a woman who\r\nhas borne a dead child that she is not allowed to drink water unless\r\nin danger of death. Logic compelled that a sick man should be treated\r\nas one possessed. Sickness was sent by Ahriman, and is to be cured\r\nby washings and spells. The most powerful therefore of all medical\r\ntreatment is magic. It was always more highly esteemed by the faithful\r\nthan treatment by drugs and the lancet.[326] Hair and nails, which\r\nhaving been cut off have at once become the property of Ahriman, may be\r\nwithdrawn from his power by prayer, and by being deposited in the earth\r\nin consecrated circles, which, being drawn round them, intrench them\r\nagainst the fiend.[327]\r\n\r\nIn the _Zend-Avesta_ it is laid down that a woman who has been just\r\ndelivered of a child is unclean. When delivered of a dead child, she\r\nmust drink gômêz. Says Darmesteter:[328] “So utterly unclean is she,\r\nthat she is not even allowed to drink water, unless she is in danger of\r\ndeath; and even then, as the sacred element has been defiled, she is\r\nliable to the penalty of a Perhôtanu. It appears from modern customs\r\nthat the treatment is the same when the child is born alive; the reason\r\nof which is that, in any case, during the first three days after\r\ndelivery she is in danger of death. A great fire is lighted to keep\r\naway the fiends, who use then their utmost efforts to kill her and her\r\nchild. She is unclean only because the death-fiend is in her.”\r\n\r\nThe Saddar 16 says: “When there is a pregnant woman in a house, one\r\nmust take care that there be fire continually in it; when the child is\r\nbrought forth, one must burn a candle, or, better still, a fire, for\r\nthree days and three nights, to render the Dêvs and Drugs unable to\r\nharm the child; for there is great danger during those three days and\r\nnights after the birth of the child.”\r\n\r\nA table of physician’s fees is given in the Vendîdâd. The healer is\r\nto attend a priest and get him well for his blessing; the master of a\r\nhouse is to pay the value of a cheap ox for the same service; but the\r\nlord of a province is to pay the value of a chariot and four. The wife\r\nof the master of a house pays the value of a she-ass for her healing,\r\nbut the wife of the lord of a province pays the value of a she-camel.\r\n\r\nIt declared that, “If several healers offered themselves together,\r\nO Spitama Zarathustra! namely, one who heals with the knife, one who\r\nheals with herbs, and one who heals with the holy word (_i.e._ by\r\nspells), it is this one who will best drive away sickness from the\r\nfaithful.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK III.\r\n\r\n                           _GREEK MEDICINE._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE MEDICINE OF THE GREEKS BEFORE THE TIME OF HIPPOCRATES.\r\n\r\n Apollo, the God of\r\n Medicine.—Cheiron.—Æsculapius.—Artemis.—Dionysus.—Ammon.—Hermes.\r\n —Prometheus.—Melampus.—Medicine  of Homer.—- Temples of\r\n Æsculapius.—The Early Ionic Philosophers.—Empedocles.—School of\r\n Crotona.—The Pythagoreans.—Grecian Theory of Diseases.—School\r\n of Cos.—The Asclepiads.—The Aliptæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nGODS OF MEDICINE.\r\n\r\nThe origin of Greek medicine is intermixed with the Hellenic mythology.\r\nWe must begin, not with ÆSCULAPIUS (ASCLEPIOS), but with the sun\r\nitself. APOLLO (PÆAN), as the god who visits men with plagues and\r\nepidemics, was also the god who wards off evil and affords help to men.\r\nHe was constantly referred to as “the Healer,” as _Alexicacus_, the\r\naverter of ills. He is the saviour from epidemics, and the _pæan_ was\r\nsung in his honour (_Iliad_, I. 473, XXII. 391).\r\n\r\nAPOLLO promoted the health and well-being of man, and was the god of\r\nprolific power, the trainer of youth, and thus he was the chief deity\r\nof healing. As the god of light and purity he was truly the health-god;\r\nand as light penetrates the darkness, he was the god of divination and\r\nthe patron of prophecy, acting chiefly through women when in a state of\r\necstasy. Homer says that Pæan[329] was the physician of the Olympian\r\ngods (_Iliad_, V. 401, 899).\r\n\r\nNext we find Cheiron, the wise and just centaur (_Iliad_, XI. 831),\r\nwho had been instructed by Apollo and Artemis, and was famous for\r\nhis skill in medicine. He was the master and instructor of the most\r\ncelebrated heroes of Greek story, and he taught the art of healing to\r\nÆSCULAPIUS (B.C. 1250). This god of medicine was said to be the son of\r\nApollo. Pausanius[330] explains the allegory thus: “If Asclepius is the\r\nair—indispensable to the health of man and beast, yet Apollo is the\r\nsun, and rightly is he called the father of Asclepius, for the sun, by\r\nhis yearly course, makes the air wholesome.”\r\n\r\nIn the Homeric poems Æsculapius is not a divinity, but merely a human\r\nbeing. Homer, however, calls all those who practise the art of healing\r\ndescendants of Pæan; his healing god is Apollo, and never Æsculapius.\r\n\r\nLegend tells that Æsculapius was the son of Apollo by Coronis, who\r\nwas killed by Artemis for unfaithfulness, and her body was about to\r\nbe burnt on the pyre, when Apollo snatched the boy out of the flames\r\nand handed him over to the centaur Cheiron, who taught him how to cure\r\nall diseases. Pindar tells the story of his instruction in the art of\r\nmedicine:—\r\n\r\n        “The rescued child he gave to share\r\n        Magnesian Centaur’s fostering care;\r\n        And learn of him the soothing art\r\n        That wards from man diseases’ dart.\r\n          Of those whom nature made to feel\r\n        Corroding ulcers gnaw their frame;\r\n          Or stones far hurled, or glittering steel,\r\n        All to the great physician came.\r\n        By summer’s heat or winter’s cold\r\n          Oppressed, of him they sought relief.\r\n        Each deadly pang his skill controlled,\r\n        And found a balm for every grief.\r\n    On some the force of charmed strains he tried,\r\n    To some the medicated draught applied;\r\n    Some limbs he placed the amulets around,\r\n    Some from the trunk he cut, and made the patient sound.”[331]\r\n\r\nIt was believed that he was even able to restore the dead to life.\r\nAccording to one tradition, Æsculapius was once shut up in the house\r\nof Glaucus, whom he was to cure, and while he was absorbed in thought\r\nthere came a serpent, which twined round his staff, and which he\r\nkilled. Then he saw another serpent, which came carrying in its mouth\r\na herb, with which it recalled to life the one that had been killed;\r\nand the physician henceforth made use of the same herb to restore dead\r\nmen to life, the popular belief, even in these early times, evidently\r\nbeing that what would cure serpents would be equally efficacious for\r\nmen. We may therefore consider the snake-entwined staff of the healing\r\ngod as the symbol of the early faith in the efficacy of experiments on\r\nanimals, though in this instance the experiment was on a dead one.\r\n\r\nÆsculapius was only too successful a practitioner; for when he was\r\nexercising his art upon Glaucus, Zeus killed the physician with a\r\nflash of lightning, as he feared that men might gradually escape death\r\naltogether. Others say the reason was that Pluto complained that by\r\nsuch medical treatment the number of the dead was too much diminished.\r\nOn the request of Apollo, Zeus placed Æsculapius amongst the stars. His\r\nwife was Epione (the soother). Homer mentions Podalirius and Machaon\r\nas sons of Æsculapius, and the following are also said to have been\r\nhis sons and daughters—Janiscus, Alexenor, Aratus, Hygeia, Ægle, Iaso,\r\nand Panaceia. Most of these, as Hygeia, the goddess of health, and\r\nPanaceia, the all-healing, it will be seen, are merely personifications\r\nof the powers ascribed to their father. There is no doubt that facts\r\nare the basis of the Æsculapian story. The divinity was worshipped all\r\nover Greece. His temples were for the most part built in mountainous\r\nand healthy places, and as often as possible in the neighbourhood\r\nof a medicinal spring; in a sense they became the prototypes of our\r\nhospitals and medical schools. Multitudes of sick persons visited them,\r\nand the priests found it to their interest to study diseases and their\r\nremedies; for though faith and religious fervour may do much for the\r\nsick, the art of the physician and the hand of the surgeon are adjuncts\r\nby no means to be despised even in a temple clinic. The chief of the\r\nÆsculapian temples was at Epidaurus; there no one was permitted to die\r\nand no woman to give birth to a child. The connection of the serpent\r\nwith the divinity probably arose from the idea that serpents represent\r\nprudence and renovation, and have the power of discovering the secret\r\nvirtues of healing plants.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the serpent twined round the rod of Æsculapius is that\r\n“as sickness comes from him, from him too must or may come the\r\nhealing.”[332] The knots on the staff are supposed to symbolize the\r\nmany knotty points which arise in the practice of physic.\r\n\r\nMINERVA was the patroness of all the arts and trades; at her festivals\r\nshe was invoked by all who desired to distinguish themselves in\r\nmedicine, as well as by the patients whom they failed to cure. As the\r\ngoddess of intelligence and inventiveness, she was the Greek patroness\r\nof physicians, and was the same deity as Pallas Athene, who bestows\r\nhealth and keeps off sickness.\r\n\r\nARTEMIS, or DIANA, as the Romans called the Greek goddess, was a deity\r\nwho, inviolate and vigorous herself, granted health and strength\r\nto others. She was the sister of Apollo, and though a dispenser of\r\nlife could, like her brother, send death and disease amongst men and\r\nanimals. Sudden deaths, especially amongst women, were described as the\r\neffect of her arrows. She was θεὰ σώτειρα, who assuaged the sufferings\r\nof mortals. When Æneas was wounded, she healed him in the temple of\r\nApollo.[333] Yet Artemis ταυροπόλος produced madness in the minds of\r\nmen.[334]\r\n\r\nShe was the Cretan Diktynna, and that goddess wore a wreath of the\r\nmagic plant _diktamnon_ or _dictamnus_, called by us _dittany_\r\n(_dictamnus ruber_, or _albus_); it grows in abundance on Mounts\r\n_Dicté_ and Ida in Crete.\r\n\r\nThe Cretan goddess BRITOMARTIS was sometimes identified with Artemis.\r\nShe too was a goddess of health as also of birth, and was supposed to\r\ndispense happiness to mortals.\r\n\r\nBACCHUS, or, as he was called by the Greeks, DIONYSUS, as the god of\r\nwine, and an inspired and an inspiring deity, who revealed the future\r\nby oracles, cured diseases by discovering to sufferers in their dreams\r\ntheir appropriate remedies. The prophet, the priest, and the physician\r\nare so often blended in one in the early history of civilization, that\r\nthe same ideas naturally clustered round Bacchus as around Apollo,\r\nand other great benefactors of mankind. The giver of vines and wine\r\nwas the dispenser of the animating, exalting, intoxicating powers of\r\nnature. As wine restores the flagging energies of the body and mind,\r\nand seems to have the power of calling back to life the departing\r\nspirit, and inspiring the languishing vitality of man, Bacchus would\r\nnaturally enough be a god of medicine. The intoxicating properties of\r\nwine would be connected with inspiration, and so Bacchus had a share in\r\nthe oracles of Delphi and Amphicleia. He was invoked as a θεὸς σωτήρ\r\nagainst raging diseases.\r\n\r\nAMMON was an Ethiopian divinity whose worship spread over Egypt,\r\nand thence to Greece, and was described as the spirit pervading the\r\nuniverse, and as the author of all life in nature.\r\n\r\nHERMES TRISMEGISTUS of the Greeks was identified in the time of Plato\r\nwith Thoth, Thot, or Theut of the Egyptians.[335]\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian THOTH was considered the father of all knowledge, and\r\neverything committed to writing was looked upon as his property; he\r\nwas therefore the embodied eek: λόγος, and so τρὶς μέγιστος, or the\r\nsuperlatively greatest. He was identified by the Greeks more or less\r\ncompletely with their own HERMES, or MERCURY as he was known to the\r\nRomans; he was the messenger of the gods; as dreams are sent by Zeus,\r\nit was his office to convey them to men, and he had power to grant\r\nrefreshing sleep or to deny the blessing. As the gods revealed the\r\nremedies for sickness in dreams, Hermes became a god of medicine.\r\n\r\nThoth, the ibis-headed, was the Egyptian god of letters, the deity\r\nof wisdom in general, who aided Horus in his conflict with Seth, and\r\nrecorded the judgments of the dead before Osiris. Hermes κριοφόρος,\r\nthe averter of diseases, was worshipped in Bœotia. Hermes, the Greek\r\ndeity, was king of the dead and the conductor of souls to their future\r\nhome. Probably, therefore, we may rightly look upon Thoth, Hermes, and\r\nHermes Trismegistus as the same person. By many Thoth is considered\r\nto be the Egyptian Æsculapius, as he was the inventor of the healing\r\nart; the Phœnician god Esmun, one of the ancient Cabiri, was invested\r\nwith similar attributes, and was worshipped at Carthage and Berytus.\r\nThe authorship of the oldest Egyptian works on medicine is ascribed to\r\nThoth. These were engraved on pillars of stone. The works of Thoth were\r\nultimately incorporated into the so-called “Hermetic Books.” Clement of\r\nAlexandria, who is our only ancient authority on these Hermetic works,\r\nsays they were forty-two in number.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS (the man of freethought) is considered by Æschylus as the\r\nfounder of human civilization.\r\n\r\nÆschylus, in his _Prometheus Chained_, makes the god say how he had\r\ntaught each useful art to man. As regards medicine, he says:—\r\n\r\n    “Hear my whole story; thou wilt wonder more\r\n    What useful arts, what science I invented.\r\n    This first and greatest; when the fell disease\r\n    Preyed on the human frame, relief was none,\r\n    Nor healing drug, nor cool, refreshing draught,\r\n    Nor pain-assuaging unguent; but they pined\r\n    Without redress, and wasted, till I taught them\r\n    To mix the balmy medicine, of power\r\n    To chase each pale disease, and soften pain.”[336]\r\n\r\nMELAMPUS, who was famous for his prophetic powers, was believed by the\r\nGreeks to have been the first mortal who practised the art of medicine,\r\nand established the worship of Dionysus in Greece. As doctors are\r\nfrequently expected to exercise the art of prophecy in conjunction with\r\ntheir profession, it is unfortunate that we have retrograded from the\r\nMelampian type. The eminent physician who tells the over-inquisitive\r\nfriends of his patients that he is “a doctor and not a prophet,” might\r\nbe answered that originally the two functions were combined. Melampus\r\ntaught the Greeks to mix their wine with water. He is fabled to have\r\nlearned the language of the birds from some young serpents who had\r\nbeen reared by him, and who licked his ears when he was asleep. When\r\nhe awoke he found that he understood what the birds said, and that he\r\ncould foretell the future.\r\n\r\nIphiclus had no children, and he asked Melampus to tell him how he\r\ncould become a father. He advised him to take the rust from a knife,\r\nand drink it in water during ten days. The remedy was eminently\r\nsuccessful, and is the first instance in which a preparation of iron is\r\nknown to have been prescribed in medicine. He cured the daughters of\r\nPrœtus by giving them hellebore (which has been called Melampodium by\r\nbotanists), and he received the eldest of the princesses in marriage.\r\nHe cured the women of Argos of a severe distemper which made them\r\ninsane, and the king showed his gratitude by giving him part of his\r\nkingdom. He received divine honours after his death, and temples were\r\nraised to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEDICINE OF HOMER.\r\n\r\nAs Homer is supposed to have lived about 850 B.C., a study of such\r\nreferences as are to be found in the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ which relate\r\nto medicine and surgery will throw an important light on the state\r\nof the healing art as it was practised at that early period of Greek\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThere is little mention of disease in Homer. We read of sudden death,\r\npestilence, and the troubles of old age, but there is hardly any fixed\r\nmorbid condition noticed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the poet exhibits considerable acquaintance with medical lore,\r\nand the human body in health and disease, he could have had little or\r\nno acquaintance with anatomy, because amongst Greeks, as amongst Jews,\r\nit was considered a profanation to dissect or mutilate the human corpse.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the rise of the Alexandrian school in the golden age of\r\nthe Ptolemies that this sentiment was overcome. Still Homer must have\r\nknown that it was the custom of the Egyptians to embalm their dead,\r\nas he refers to the process in the _Iliad_,[337] where Thetis poured\r\ninto the nostrils of the corpse red nectar and ambrosia to preserve\r\nit from putrefaction. Ambrosia is referred to by Virgil as useful for\r\nhealing wounds, and nectar was supposed to preserve flesh from decay.\r\nHomer’s heroes seem to have been singularly healthy folk; their only\r\ndemand for the services of the army surgeons arose from the accidents\r\nof war. MACHAON distinguished himself in surgery, and PODALIRIUS is\r\nreputed to have been the first phlebotomist. Their services would be\r\nchiefly required for extracting arrow-heads and spear-heads, checking\r\nhæmorrhage by compression and styptic applications, and laying soothing\r\nointments on wounded and bruised surfaces. Beyond these minor duties\r\nof the army surgeon, we find little record of their work. Mention is\r\nnot made of amputations, of setting of fractures, or tying of arteries.\r\nWounds were probed by Machaon, surgeon to Menelaus (Book IV.).\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the surgical skill of Machaon, we have proof\r\nthat the art of dieting the wounded was not at all understood in the\r\nHomeric days. The wine and cheese was not the kind of refreshment which\r\nfound favour in Plato’s time with the Greek physicians. Plato, in the\r\n_Republic_ (Book III.), deals with the question at some length. He says\r\nthat the draught of Pramnian wine with barley meal and cheese was an\r\ninflammatory mixture, and a strange potion for a man in the state of\r\nEurypylus.\r\n\r\nBut he excuses the sons of Asclepius for their treatment, explaining\r\nthat their method was not intended for coddling invalids, but for such\r\nas had not time to be ill, and that the healing art was revealed for\r\nthe benefit of those whose constitutions were naturally sound, and that\r\ndoctors used to expel their disorders by drugs and the use of the knife\r\nwithout interrupting their customary avocations, declining altogether\r\nto assist chronic invalids to protract a miserable existence by a\r\nstudied regimen.\r\n\r\nLe Clerc says[338] that Plato is wrong in this explanation of the\r\nHomeric treatment, and that the true one is that in those days the\r\ndietary of the sick was not understood. Modern medicine will decline to\r\naccept either theory. The fact is, Homer’s physicians were right. Good\r\nold wine was the best thing possible to restore a man fainting from\r\nthe loss of blood; as for the cheese it was grated fine, and therefore\r\nwas a peculiarly nutritious food in a fairly digestible condition. The\r\nbarley water at all times was at least irreproachable. Although there\r\nis little evidence in the Homeric poems of any medical treatment which\r\npasses the limits of surgery, this is by no means conclusive against\r\nthe possession of the higher art by Podalirius. In an epic poem, as Le\r\nClerc points out, the subject is altogether too exalted to admit of\r\nmedical discourses on the treatment of colic and diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nNeither must we be surprised, that when the pestilence appeared in the\r\ncamp of Agamemnon, Podalirius and Machaon did nothing to avert it.\r\nSuch a disease was at that time considered beyond all human skill, and\r\nas the direct visitation of the gods. Homer clearly explains that the\r\npestilence was due to their anger. Galen adduces evidence to prove that\r\nÆsculapius did really practise medicine, by music and by gymnastics, or\r\nexercises on foot and horseback.\r\n\r\nAs Le Clerc says,[339] this may have been patriotic exaggeration on the\r\npart of Galen. To Podalirius is attributed the invention of the art\r\nof bleeding. As he returned from the Trojan war, he was driven by a\r\ntempest on the shores of Caria, where a shepherd, having learned that\r\nhe was a physician, took him to the king, whose daughter was sick.\r\nHe cured her by bleeding from both arms; the king gave her to him in\r\nmarriage, with a rich grant of land. This is the oldest example which\r\nwe have of bleeding.\r\n\r\nPodalirius had a son Hippolochus, of whom the great Hippocrates was\r\na descendant. Le Clerc devotes a chapter of his _History of Medicine_\r\nto reflections on the antiquity of the practice of venesection, and\r\nspeculates on the manner of its discovery. He says, the fact that Homer\r\nis silent on the subject makes neither for nor against the theory that\r\nit was known in his time; in such works as those of the poet he was\r\nunder no obligation to specify particularly the remedies employed by\r\nthe doctors. He speaks, for example, of soothing medicines and bitter\r\nroots without further definition. It would be as reasonable to agree\r\nthat purgation was unknown from Homer’s silence on the matter.\r\n\r\nHomer knew something of the parts of the body where wounds are most\r\nfatal. He says (Book IV., l. 183), “The arrow fell in no such place as\r\ndeath could enter at,” and (Book VIII., l. 326), where the arrow struck\r\nthe right shoulder ’twixt the neck and breast, “the wound was wondrous\r\nfull of death.”\r\n\r\nHe knew much of drugs and medicinal plants: φάρμακον (pharmakon) in\r\nthe _Iliad_ is a remedy, an unguent or application, and is mentioned\r\nnine times; in the _Odyssey_ it is a drug or medicinal herb, and is\r\nreferred to twenty times. In Book XI., Eurypylus, when wounded, is\r\ntreated with the “wholesome onion,” a potion is confected with good old\r\nwine of Pramnius, with scraped goat’s-milk cheese and fine flour mixed\r\nwith it. Later on in the same book, we read of the bruised, bitter,\r\npain-assuaging root being applied to a wound; it was some strong\r\nastringent bitter plant, probably a species of geranium.\r\n\r\nThen in the _Odyssey_ (Book IV. 200) occurs the reference to nepenthe,\r\na drug which has puzzled commentators exceedingly; some say it was\r\npoppy juice, others hashish; we have also the magic moly, which Mercury\r\ngave to Ulysses against the charms of Circe. By some this is thought\r\nto have been the unpoetical garlic, by others to be wild rue, such as\r\nJosephus refers to. It was more probably the mandrake.\r\n\r\nThere is a very curious and important reference to sulphur, as a\r\ndisinfectant fumigation in the _Odyssey_ (Book XXII. 481):—\r\n\r\n    “Bring sulphur straight, and fire” (the monarch cries).\r\n    “She hears, and at the word obedient flies,\r\n    With fire and sulphur, cure of noxious fumes,\r\n    He purged the walls and blood-polluted rooms.”\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what the sanitary authorities do with fever dens at\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nHomer several times refers to Machaon:—\r\n\r\n    “And great Machaon to the ships convey.\r\n    A wise physician, skilled our wounds to heal,\r\n    Is more than armies to the public weal.”\r\n                                                    (_Iliad_, XI. 614.)\r\n\r\nWith Podalirius, his brother, also a “famed surgeon,” he went to Troy\r\nwith thirty ships. Homer calls them “divine professors of the healing\r\narts” (_Iliad_, II. 728), and to them was committed the care of the\r\nmedical work of the expedition.\r\n\r\nWhen Menelaus had been wounded by the spear of Pandarus, Machaon, we\r\nare told by Homer (_Iliad_, IV. 218)—\r\n\r\n    “Sucked the blood, and sovereign balm infused,\r\n    Which Cheiron gave, and Æsculapius used.”\r\n\r\nAgamede is referred to by Homer (_Iliad_, XI. 739) as acquainted with\r\nthe healing properties of all the plants that grow on the earth. She\r\nwas a daughter of Augeias, and wife of Mulius. The poet refers to her\r\nas—\r\n\r\n    “She that all simples’ healing virtues knew,\r\n    And every herb that drinks the morning dew.”[340]\r\n\r\nHESIOD lived about the same time as Homer. He wrote the famous _Works\r\nand Days_, a species of farmer’s calendar, and the _Theogony_.\r\n\r\nOn account of the knowledge he possessed of the properties of plants,\r\nTheophrastus, Pliny, and others ranked him amongst the physicians.[341]\r\n\r\nBoth Podalirius and Machaon were held in great honour, not only as\r\ncombatants, but as medical advisers, and Homer’s account of them\r\nexhibits the medical profession of his time as one that was very highly\r\nesteemed. In the fragment of Arctinus which remains to us, we find thus\r\nearly the distinction made between the arts of medicine and surgery,\r\nthe two principal divisions of medical science: “Then Asclepius\r\nbestowed the power of healing upon his two sons; nevertheless, he made\r\none of the two more celebrated than the other; on one did he bestow the\r\nlighter hand, that he might draw missiles from the flesh, and sew up\r\nand heal all wounds; but he other he endowed with great precision of\r\nmind, so as to understand what cannot be seen, and to heal seemingly\r\nincurable diseases.”[342]\r\n\r\nThis very interesting extract not only shows the early separation of\r\nthe arts of medicine and surgery, but it exhibits very clearly how\r\nit arose that the former was always held to be the higher branch of\r\nthe medical profession. To sew up a laceration, or extract an arrow\r\nor a thorn from the flesh, demanded only manual dexterity; but “to\r\nunderstand that which cannot be seen,” and heal internal organs that\r\ncannot even be touched, required a skill and a mental precision that\r\nmen even in those early times were able to appreciate as much the\r\nhigher of the two arts. There seems, however, some confusion of the\r\ntwo branches in the lines:—\r\n\r\n    “A wise physician, skilled our wounds to heal,\r\n    Is more than armies to the public weal.”\r\n\r\nIf we suppose that the account of venesection which attributes its\r\ndiscovery to Podalirius is fabulous, this would only serve to prove the\r\nantiquity of the practice. Hippocrates is said to be the first medical\r\nwriter who has spoken of bleeding,[343] yet we must not suppose it\r\nwas unknown before his time. He advises blood-letting from the arm,\r\nfrom the temporal vessels, from the leg, etc., in some cases even to\r\nfainting. He is familiar with cupping and other methods of abstracting\r\nblood; it is not probable, therefore, that the operation was a new one\r\nin his day.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the practice of purging as a remedy was attributed\r\nto Melampus. But we know that the Egyptians made use of purgative and\r\nemetic medicines. There were many purgatives in use in the time of\r\nHippocrates, as hellebore, elaterium, colocynth, and scammony. All\r\nthese medicines could not have been discovered at once, as Le Clerc\r\npoints out; mankind, therefore, must have gradually acquired their\r\nuse. When persons were overloaded in the stomach and constipated,\r\nnothing was more natural than that they should seek relief by removing\r\nthe mechanical causes of their distress. Some one had taken some herb\r\nwhich had caused him to vomit or to be purged, and had experienced the\r\nbenefit of the evacuation; he told his friends, and they perhaps had\r\nbeen aided by similar means. Or again, some illness had been alleviated\r\nby the supervention of diarrhœa, and art was called in to imitate\r\nthe beneficial effect of nature’s cure. In this way, says Le Clerc,\r\nbleeding may reasonably have been discovered: a severe headache is\r\noften relieved by bleeding from the nose, what more natural than that\r\nthe process of relief should be imitated by opening a vein?\r\n\r\nPliny, indeed, in his usual manner, introduces a fable to account for\r\nthe discovery of venesection. He says[344] that the hippopotamus having\r\nbecome too fat and unwieldy through over-eating, bled himself with a\r\nsharp-pointed reed, and when he had drawn sufficient blood, closed the\r\nwound with clay. Men have imitated the operation, says Pliny. This is\r\nmatched by the story of the ibis with her long bill being the inventor\r\nof the clyster. Most of the medical beast stories are probably on a\r\nlevel with these.\r\n\r\n_Hygeia_, the wife of _Æsculapius_, and her children, bore names which\r\nshow the same poetic fancy as that which constituted Apollo the author\r\nof medicine. _Æsculapius_ is the air. _Hygeia_ is health; _Ægle_ is\r\nbrightness or splendour, because the air is illumined and purified by\r\nthe sun. _Iaso_ is recovery, _Panacea_ the universal medicine, _Roma_\r\nis strength.\r\n\r\nThe ancients everywhere believed that the healing art was taught to\r\nmankind by the gods. “The art of medicine,” says Cicero, “has been\r\nconsecrated by the invention of the immortal gods.”[345]\r\n\r\nHippocrates[346] attributed the art of medicine to the Supreme Being.\r\nAs the Greeks believed that the arts in general were invented by the\r\ngods, it was a natural belief that the knowledge of medicine should\r\nhave been taught by the heavenly powers. The mysteries of life,\r\ndisease, and death were peculiarly the province of supernatural beings,\r\nand man has ever attributed to such powers all those things which he\r\ncould not comprehend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLES OF ÆSCULAPIUS.\r\n\r\nThe worship of Asclepius or Æsculapius is so closely associated with\r\nthe practice of Greek medicine that it is impossible to understand\r\nthe one without knowing something of the other. Sick persons made\r\npilgrimages to the temples of the god of healing, just as now they go\r\nto Lourdes, St. Winifred’s Well, or other famous Christian shrines for\r\nthe recovery of their health. After prayers to the god, ablutions, and\r\nsacrifices, the patient was put to sleep on the skin of the animal\r\noffered at the altar, or at the foot of the statue of the divinity,\r\nwhile the priests performed their sacred rites. In his sleep he would\r\nhave pointed out to him in a dream what he ought to do for the recovery\r\nof his health. Sometimes the appropriate medicine would be suggested,\r\nbut more commonly rules of conduct and diet would suffice. When the\r\ncure took place, which very frequently happened by suggestion as in\r\nmodern hypnotism, and by the stimulus to the nervous system consequent\r\nupon the journey, and the hope excited in the patient, a record of the\r\ncase and the cure was carved on the temple walls. Thus were recorded\r\nthe first histories of cases, and their study afforded the most\r\nvaluable treatises on the healing art to the physicians who studied\r\nthem. The priests of Æsculapius were sometimes called Asclepiads, but\r\nthey did not themselves act as physicians, nor were they the actual\r\nfounders of Greek medicine. The true Asclepiads were healers and not\r\npriests. Anathemata (ἀνάθεμα, anything offered up) were offerings of\r\nmodels in gold, silver, etc., of diseased legs, feet, etc., or of\r\ndeformed limbs consecrated to the gods in the temples by the devotion\r\nof the patients who had received benefit from the prayers to the\r\ndeities who were worshipped therein. The priests of the temples sold\r\nthese again and again to fresh patients.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY IONIC PHILOSOPHERS.\r\n\r\nThe various schools of Greek philosophy were intimately associated\r\nwith the study of medicine. They endeavoured to fathom the mystery\r\nof life, and the relationship of the visible order of things to the\r\nunseen world. The philosophers were therefore not only physicists,\r\nbut metaphysicians, and the unhappy science of medicine, a homeless\r\nwanderer, had to shelter herself now with the natural philosophers and\r\nagain with the metaphysicians. Probably the philosophers never really\r\npractised physic, but merely speculated about it, as did Plato. A brief\r\nnotice of the various philosophers of the Ionic, Italian, Eleatic, and\r\nMaterialistic schools who were more or less associated with the study\r\nof medicine must suffice as an introduction to Greek medicine proper,\r\nwhich had its origin with Hippocrates.\r\n\r\nTHALES OF MILETUS (about 609 B.C.), the Ionian philosopher, introduced\r\nEgyptian and Asiatic science into Greece. He had probably in his\r\ntravels in the land of the Pharaohs devoted himself to mathematical\r\npursuits, and if not a scientific inquirer was a deep speculator on\r\nthe origin of things. He held that everything arises from water, and\r\neverything ultimately again resolves itself into water. Everything, he\r\nsaid, is full of gods; the soul originates motion (the magnet has a\r\nsoul, according to him), and so the indwelling power or soul of water\r\nproduces the phenomena of the natural world. He must not, however,\r\nbe understood as teaching the doctrine of the Soul of the Universe,\r\nor of a Creating Deity. Thales was the first writer on physics and\r\nthe founder of the philosophy of Greece. Le Clerc connects him with\r\nmedicine by his converse with the priest-physicians of Egypt, and that\r\nhe had performed certain expiatory or purifying ceremonies for the\r\nLacedæmonians which could only be done by such as were divines and\r\nphysicians.[347]\r\n\r\nPHERECYDES, the Syrian, a philosopher who lived about the same time as\r\nThales, is said by Galen to have written upon diet.\r\n\r\nEPIMENEDES was a sort of Greek Rip Van Winkle, who purified Athens in\r\nthe time of a plague by means of mysterious rites and sacrifices. He\r\nexcelled as a fasting man, so that he was said to have been exempt\r\nfrom the ordinary necessities of nature, and could send out his soul\r\nfrom his body and recall it like the Mahatmas. He was of the class of\r\npriestly bards, a seer and prophet who was well acquainted with the\r\nvirtues of plants for medicinal purposes, and as he was believed to\r\nhave gone to sleep in a cave for fifty-seven years, he was credited\r\nwith the possession of supernatural medicinal powers.[348]\r\n\r\nANAXIMANDER, born B.C. 610, is said to have been a pupil of Thales.\r\nHe taught that a single determinate substance having a middle nature\r\nbetween water and air was the infinite, everlasting, and divine, though\r\nnot intelligent material from which all things had their origin. This\r\nhe called the ἄπειρον, the chaos. All substances were derived thence\r\nby the conflict of heat and cold and the electric affinities of the\r\nparticles. The atomic theory is foreshadowed here.\r\n\r\nANAXIMENES was the friend of Thales and Anaximander, and all three were\r\nborn at Miletus. He considered that air was the first cause of all\r\nthings, or primary condition of matter; all finite things were formed\r\nfrom the infinite air by compression or rarefaction produced by eternal\r\nmotion. Heat and cold are produced by the varying density of the primal\r\nelement. He held the eternity of matter like his brother philosophers,\r\nand believed that the soul itself is merely a form of air. He held no\r\nDivine Author of the Universe, motion being a necessary law of the\r\nuniverse, and with motion and air he required nothing else for the\r\nconstitution of all things.\r\n\r\nHERACLEITUS of Ephesus, born about 556 B.C., embodied his system\r\nof philosophy in his work _On Nature_. He held that the ground of\r\nall phenomena is a physical principle, a living unity, pervading\r\neverything, inherent in all things—fire, that is, as he explains, a\r\nclear light fluid “self-kindled and self-extinguished.” The world was\r\nnot created by God, but evolved from the rational intelligence which\r\nguides the universe—fire. Fire longs to manifest itself in various\r\nforms; from its pure state in heaven it descends, assumes the form of\r\nearth, passing in its progress through that of water. Man’s soul is a\r\nspark of the divine fire.\r\n\r\nANAXAGORAS, born about 499 B.C., was the friend of Pericles and\r\nEuripides at Athens. Seeking to explain the world and man by a higher\r\ncause than the physical ones of his predecessors, he postulated\r\n_nous_—that is, mind, thought, or intelligence. As nothing can come\r\nout of nothing, he did not attribute to this _nous_ the creation of\r\nthe world, but only its order and arrangement. Matter is eternal,\r\nbut existed as chaos till _nous_ evolved order from the confusion.\r\nBaas[349] says his physiological and pathological views may be\r\nthus described: “The animal body, by means of a kind of affinity,\r\nappropriates to itself from the nutritive supply the portions similar\r\nto itself. Males originate in the right, females in the left side\r\nof the uterus. Diseases are occasioned by the bile which penetrates\r\ninto the blood-vessels, the lungs, and the pleura.” He undertook the\r\ndissection of animals, remarked the existence in the brain of the\r\nlateral ventricles, and was the first to declare that the bile is the\r\ncause of acute sickness.[350]\r\n\r\nDIOGENES OF APOLLONIA, the eminent natural philosopher, lived at Athens\r\nabout 460 B.C. He was a pupil of Anaximenes, and wrote a work entitled\r\n_On Nature_, in which he treated of physical science generally.\r\nAristotle has preserved for us some of the few fragments which remain.\r\nThe most important is the description of the origin and distribution of\r\nthe veins, and is inserted in the third book of Aristotle’s _History\r\nof Animals_. Diogenes Laertius gives an account of the philosophical\r\nteaching of the philosopher: “He maintained that air was the primal\r\nelement of all things; that there was an infinite number of worlds,\r\nand an infinite void; that air, densified and rarefied, produced the\r\ndifferent members of the universe; that nothing was produced from\r\nnothing, or was reduced to nothing; that the earth was round, supported\r\nin the middle, and had received its shape from the whirling round of\r\nthe warm vapours, and its concretion and hardening from cold.”[351]\r\n\r\nDiogenes recognised no distinction between mind and matter, yet he\r\nconsidered air possessed intellectual energy.\r\n\r\nWe find in this philosopher many indications that the vascular system\r\nwas in some degree beginning to be understood.[352] Mr. Lewes and Mr.\r\nGrote agree that Diogenes deserves a higher place in the evolution of\r\nphilosophy than either Hegel or Schwegler.\r\n\r\nEMPEDOCLES of Agrigentum, born about 490 B.C., now bears forward the\r\nflaming torch of medical science, and in his hands it burns more\r\nbrightly still. Aristotle mentions him among the Ionian physiologists,\r\nand ranks him with the atomistic philosophers and Anaxagoras. These\r\nall sought to discover the basis of all changes and to explain them.\r\nAccording to Empedocles: “There are four ultimate kinds of things, four\r\nprimal divinities, of which are made all structures in the world—fire,\r\nair, water, and earth. These four elements are eternally brought into\r\nunion, and eternally parted from each other, by two divine beings or\r\npowers, love and hatred—an attractive and a repulsive force which the\r\nordinary eye can see working amongst men, but which really pervade the\r\nwhole world. According to the different proportions in which these four\r\nindestructible and unchangeable matters are combined with each other\r\nis the difference of the organic structure produced; _e.g._, flesh and\r\nblood are made of equal parts of all four elements, whereas bones are\r\none-half fire, one-fourth earth, and one-fourth water. It is in the\r\naggregation and segregation of elements thus arising that Empedocles,\r\nlike the atomists, finds the real process which corresponds to what is\r\npopularly termed growth, increase, or decrease. Nothing new comes or\r\ncan come into being; the only change that can occur is a change in the\r\njuxtaposition of element with element.”[353]\r\n\r\nHe considered that men, animals, and plants are demons punished by\r\nbanishment, but who, becoming purified, may regain the home of the\r\ngods. It is hardly necessary to say that he held the demoniacal\r\npossession theory of disease, and treated all complaints by means\r\nappropriate to the theory. Anticipating the modern opinions of the\r\nbacteriologists, he banished epidemics by building great fires and\r\ndraining the water from marshy lands. He understood something of the\r\ncauses of infectious diseases, and in their treatment usurped the\r\nprovince of the gods who had sent them.[354] He believed the embryo\r\nwas nourished through the navel. We owe to him the terms _amnion_ and\r\n_chorion_ (_i.e._, the innermost and outer membranes with which the\r\nfœtus is surrounded in the womb). He believed that death was caused by\r\nextinction of heat, that expiration arose from the upward motion of the\r\nblood, and inspiration from the reverse. He is said to have raised a\r\ndead woman to life.[355]\r\n\r\nEmpedocles believed in the doctrine of re-incarnation. “I well\r\nremember,” he says, “the time before I was Empedocles, that I once\r\nwas a boy, then a girl, a plant, a glittering fish, a bird that cut\r\nthe air.” To his disciples he said: “By my instructions you shall\r\nlearn medicines that are powerful to cure disease, and re-animate\r\nold age—you shall recall the strength of the dead man, when he has\r\nalready become the victim of Pluto.”[356] Further speaking of himself,\r\nhe says: “I am revered by both men and women, who follow me by ten\r\nthousands, inquiring the road to boundless wealth, seeking the gift of\r\nprophecy, and who would learn the marvellous skill to cure all kinds of\r\ndiseases.”[357]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL OF THE PYTHAGOREANS AT CROTONA.\r\n\r\nAlthough in ancient Greece the art of medicine, as we have already\r\nshown, was closely connected with the temples, if not actually with\r\nreligion, its entanglement with philosophy was a scarcely less\r\nunfortunate connection, and it was not able to make any real progress\r\ntill HIPPOCRATES liberated it from both priests and philosophers.\r\n582 years before Christ PYTHAGORAS was born, the ideal hero or saint\r\nwhom we faintly discern through the mythical haze which has always\r\nenveloped him. Philosopher, prophet, wonder-worker, and physician, he\r\ngathered into his mind as into a focus the wisdom of the Brahmans,\r\nthe Persian Magi, the Egyptians, the Phœnicians, the Chaldæans, the\r\nJews, the Arabians, and the Druids of Gaul, amongst whom he had\r\ntravelled, if we may believe what is reported of him. He may have\r\nvisited Egypt,[358] at any rate, besides acquainting himself with the\r\ncountries of the Mediterranean. His authentic history begins with his\r\nemigration to Crotona, in South Italy, about the year 529. There he\r\nfounded a kind of religious brotherhood or ethical-reform society, and\r\n“appeared as the revealer of a mode of life calculated to raise his\r\ndisciples above the level of mankind, and to recommend them to the\r\nfavour of the gods.”[359] Grote believes that the removal to Crotona\r\nwas prompted by the desire to study medicine in its famous school,\r\nprobably combined with the notion of instructing the pupils in his\r\nphilosophy. He rendered great services to the healing art by insisting\r\non the necessity of a thorough comprehension of the organs, structure,\r\nand functions of the body in their normal, healthy condition; this must\r\nbe conceded, though his visionary philosophy did much to destroy the\r\nscientific value of his medical teaching.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the healing art amongst the Greeks and Hellenic peoples\r\ngenerally was Pythagoras. He was imbued with Eastern mysticism,\r\nteaching that the air is full of spiritual beings, who send dreams to\r\nmen and cause to men and cattle disease and health. He taught that\r\nthese spirits must be conciliated by lustrations and invocations. Pliny\r\nsays[360] that he taught that holding dill (_anethum_) in the hand\r\nis good against epilepsy. The health of the body is to be maintained\r\nby diet and gymnastics. It is interesting to find that this great\r\nphilosopher recommended music to restore the harmony of the spirits.\r\nBesides the magic virtues of the dill, he held that many other plants\r\npossessed them, such as the cabbage (a food in great favour with the\r\nPythagoreans), the squill, and anise. He held that surgery was not to\r\nbe practised, as it is unlawful, but salves and poultices were to be\r\npermitted. His disciples attributed the union between medicine and\r\nphilosophy to him.\r\n\r\nThe Pythagorean philosophy turns upon the idea of numbers and the\r\nmathematical relations of things. “All things are number;” “number is\r\nthe essence of everything.” The world subsists by the principle of\r\nordered numbers. The spheres revolve harmoniously; the seven planets\r\nare the seven golden chords of the heavenly heptachord. As a corollary\r\nto this notion we have the theory of opposites. We have the odd and\r\neven, and their combinations. The even is the unlimited, the odd the\r\nlimited; so all things are derived from the combination of the limited\r\nand the unlimited. Then we get the limited and the unlimited, the odd\r\nand the even, the one and many, right and left, masculine and feminine,\r\nrest and motion, straight and crooked, light and darkness, good and\r\nevil, square and oblong. When opposites unite, there is harmony. The\r\nnumber ten comprehends all other numbers in itself; four was held in\r\ngreat respect, because it is the first square number and the potential\r\ndecade (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10). Pythagoras was the discoverer of the\r\nholy τετρακτύς, “the fountain and root of ever-living nature.” Five\r\nsignifies marriage, one is reason because unchangeable, two is opinion,\r\nseven is called παρθένος and Ἀθήνη, because within the decade it has\r\nneither factors nor product.[361]\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of transmigration of souls, metempsychosis, is\r\nPythagoras’s. He probably borrowed it from the Orphic mysteries;\r\noriginally no doubt it came from Asia. Asceticism, mysticism, and\r\nNeoplatonism sprang from this noble and lofty philosophy. Closely\r\nconnected with his theory of numbers he held that from these points\r\nare produced, from these lines, from lines figures, and from figures\r\nsolid bodies. The elements fire, water, earth, and air, account in his\r\nconception for the formation of the world. He understood the structure\r\nof the body, its procreation and development. He believed that the\r\nanimal soul is an emanation from the world-soul; the universal soul\r\nis God, author of himself. Demons are an order of beings between the\r\nhighest and the lowest. Striving for the good brings moral health.\r\nBodily health means harmony, disease means discord. Diseases are caused\r\nby demons, and are to be dispelled by prayers, offerings, and music. He\r\nfirst among the Greeks taught the immortality of the soul; he held a\r\ndoctrine of rewards and punishments, and taught that of metempsychosis.\r\nFor many succeeding ages the Pythagorean doctrine had the greatest\r\ninfluence on the art of medicine.[362]\r\n\r\nLe Clerc says that Pythagoras obtained his ideas of the climacteric\r\nyears from the Chaldæans. The term is applied to the seventh year of\r\nthe life of man, and it was anciently believed that at each change we\r\nincur some risk to life or health, on account of the bodily changes\r\nundergone at that time.[363] Celsus says that the medical sentiment\r\nwith respect to the septenary number in diseases, and that of the odd\r\nand even days, is of Pythagorean origin.[364] The Pythagoreans had a\r\ngreat respect for the number four. The quaternary number was sacred to\r\nthe Egyptians; they burned in the temples of Isis a kind of resinous\r\ngum, myrrh, and other drugs, in the preparation of which they had\r\nregard to the number four. The Israelites imitated them in this respect\r\n(Exod. xxx. 2).[365]\r\n\r\nThe sacred bean of Pythagoras was the object of religious veneration in\r\nEgypt; the priests were commanded not to look upon it. It is thought to\r\nhave been the East Indian _Nelumbium_.[366]\r\n\r\nZAMOLXIS, who was a god to the Getans, is supposed by some to have\r\nbeen a slave and disciple of Pythagoras; by others he is considered an\r\naltogether mythical personage. He is credited by those who believe him\r\nto have been a physician with having said that “A man could not cure\r\nthe eyes without curing the head, nor the head without all the rest\r\nof the body, nor the body without the soul.” Plato said much the same\r\nthing when he remarked, “To cure a headache you must treat the whole\r\nman.” Zamolxis cured the soul, not by the enchantments of magic, but by\r\nwise discourse and reasonable conversation. “These discourses,” said\r\nPlato, “produce wisdom in the soul, which having once been acquired it\r\nis easy after that to procure health both for the head and all the rest\r\nof the body.”\r\n\r\nDEMOCEDES was a celebrated physician of Crotona, in Magna Grecia, who\r\nlived in the sixth century B.C. He went to practise at Ægina, where\r\nhe received from the public treasury a sum equal to about £344 a year\r\nfor his services. The next year he went to Athens at a salary equal to\r\n£406, and the following year he went to the island of Samos. The tyrant\r\nPolycrates gave him the salary of two talents. He was carried prisoner\r\nto Susa to the court of Darius, where he acquired a great reputation\r\nand much wealth by curing the king’s foot and the breast of the queen.\r\nIt is recorded that Darius ordered the surgeons who had failed to cure\r\nhim to be put to death, but Democedes interceded for and saved them. He\r\nultimately escaped to Crotona, where he settled, the Persians having in\r\nvain demanded his return.[367] He wrote a work on medicine.\r\n\r\nDEMOCRITUS, of Abdera, was a contemporary of Socrates; he was born\r\nbetween 494 and 460 B.C., and was one of the founders of the Atomic\r\nphilosophy. He was profoundly versed in all the knowledge of his\r\ntime. So ardent a student was he, that he once said that he preferred\r\nthe discovery of a true cause to the possession of the kingdom of\r\nPersia. The highest object of scientific investigation he held to be\r\nthe _discovery of causes_. He wrote on medicine, and devoted himself\r\nzealously to the study of anatomy and physiology. Pliny says that he\r\ncomposed a special treatise on the structure of the chameleon.[368] He\r\nwrote on canine rabies, and on the influence of music in the treatment\r\nof disease. He is, however, best known to science on account of his\r\ncosmical theory. All that exists is vacuum and atoms. The atoms are\r\nthe ultimate material of all things, even of spirit. They are uncaused\r\nand eternal, invisible, yet extended, heavy and impenetrable. They\r\nare in constant motion, and have been so from all eternity. By their\r\nmotion the world and all it contains was produced. Soul and fire are of\r\nthe same nature, of small, smooth, round atoms, and it is by inhaling\r\nand exhaling these that life is maintained. The soul perishes with\r\nthe body. He rejected all theology and popular mythology. Reason had\r\nnothing to do with the creation of the world, and he said, “There is\r\nnothing true; and if there is, we do not know it.” “We know nothing,\r\nnot even if there is anything to know.” He died in great honour,\r\nyet in poverty, at an advanced age (some writers say at 109 years).\r\nHis knowledge of nature, and especially of medicine, caused him to\r\nbe considered a sorcerer and a magician. There was a tradition that\r\nhe deprived himself of his sight in order to be undisturbed in his\r\nintellectual speculations. He probably became blind by too close\r\nattention to study. Another story was that he was considered to be\r\ninsane, and Hippocrates was sent for to cure him.\r\n\r\nThe great philosophers of ancient Greece believed that all the elements\r\nare modifications of one common substance, called the primary matter,\r\nwhich they demonstrated to be devoid of all quality and form, but\r\nsusceptible of all qualities and forms. It is everything in capacity,\r\nbut nothing in actuality. Matter is eternal; the elements are the first\r\nmatter arranged into certain distinguishing forms. Some of the early\r\nphilosophers held that all the materials which compose the universe\r\nexisted in a fluid form; they understood by fire, matter in a highly\r\nrefined state, and that it is the element most intimately connected\r\nwith life, some even considering it the very essence of the soul. “Our\r\nsouls are fire,” says Phornutus. “What we call heat is immortal,” says\r\none of the Hippocratic writers, “and understands, sees, and hears all\r\nthings that are or will be.”[369]\r\n\r\nBacon explains the ancient fable of Proteus as signifying matter, a\r\nsomething which, being below all forms and supporting them, is yet\r\ndifferent from them all.\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton is not widely different from Strabo when he says that\r\nall bodies may be convertible into one another.\r\n\r\nCommenting upon these opinions of the Greek philosophers, Dr. Adams\r\nsays, in his introduction to the works of Hippocrates:[370] “If every\r\nstep which we advance in the knowledge of the intimate structure of\r\nthings leads us to contract the number of substances formerly held to\r\nbe simple, I would not wonder if it should yet turn out that oxygen,\r\ncarbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen are—like what the ancients held the\r\nelements to be—all nothing else but different modifications of one\r\never-changing matter.”\r\n\r\nThe theories of the Greek philosophers on the elements are poetically\r\nsummed up in Ovid’s _Metamorphoses_:—\r\n\r\n    “Nor those which elements we call abide,\r\n    Nor to this figure nor to that are ty’d:\r\n    For this eternal world is said of old\r\n    But four prolific principles to hold,\r\n    Four different bodies; two to heaven ascend,\r\n    And other two down to the centre tend.\r\n    Fire first, with wings expanded, mounts on high,\r\n    Pure, void of weight, and dwells in upper sky;\r\n    Then air, because unclogged, in empty space\r\n    Flies after fire, and claims the second place;\r\n    But weighty water, as her nature guides,\r\n    Lies on the lap of earth; and mother Earth subsides.\r\n    All things are mixed of these, which all contain,\r\n    And into these are all resolved again;\r\n    Earth rarifies to dew; expanding more,\r\n    The subtle dew in air begins to soar;\r\n    Spreads as she flies, and, weary of the name,\r\n    Extenuates still, and changes into flame.\r\n    Thus having by degrees perfection won,\r\n    Restless, they soon untwist the web they spun,\r\n    And fire begins to lose her radiant hue,\r\n    Mixed with gross air, and air descends in dew!\r\n    And dew condensing, does her form forego,\r\n    And sinks, a heavy lump of earth, below.\r\n    Thus are their figures never at a stand,\r\n    But changed by Nature’s innovating hand.”[371]\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEK THEORIES OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\nAs the Greeks believed that all diseases were the consequences of\r\nthe anger of the gods, it was in their temples that cures were most\r\nlikely to take place. Faith was the _sine quâ non_ in the patient,\r\nand everything about the temple and its ceremonies was calculated to\r\nexcite religious awe and to stimulate faith. Preliminary purifications,\r\nfasting, massage, and fomentations with herbs, were necessary parts\r\nof the initiatory ceremonies, and the imagination was excited by\r\neverything that the sufferer saw around him. He heard the stories of\r\nthe marvellous cures which had taken place at the sacred fane. Tablets\r\nround the walls, placed there by grateful worshippers who had been\r\ncured in the past,[372] served to fill the mind with hope, when, as\r\nwas the practice, the patient lay down in the holy place by the image\r\nof the healing god, that in the incubatory sleep the remedies which\r\nwere to cure him might be revealed. Sometimes no such revelation was\r\nvouchsafed, then sacrifices and prayers were offered; if these failed,\r\nthe priests themselves would appear in the mask and the dress of the\r\nhealing god, and in the darkness and mystery of the night reveal the\r\nnecessary prescriptions. To interpret the dreams was the task of the\r\npriests at all times, just as it was in the temples of ancient Egypt.\r\nDivination, magic, and astrology largely assisted in the work of\r\ndiscovering the requisite remedies. If all failed, it was due not to\r\nany defect on the part of the divinity or his servants, but simply\r\nto the want of faith on the part of the patient. The festivals of\r\nÆsculapius were called Asclepia, and the presiding priests of the\r\nhealing god were named Asclepiades. The schools of the Asclepiades\r\nwere a sort of medical guild, and their doctrines were divided into\r\nexoteric and esoteric. They naturally became possessed of a great body\r\nof medical teaching, which was preserved as a precious secret and\r\nhanded down from generation to generation. The Asclepiadæ thus became\r\nthe hereditary physicians of Greece. Medicine at this period was not\r\na science to be taught to all comers, but was a mystery to be orally\r\ntransmitted. These men pretended to be descendants of Æsculapius, just\r\nas now the imitators of medicines, perfumes, etc., which have become\r\ncelebrated, give out that they belong to the family of the inventor,\r\nand thus know the secrets of the preparation.[373]\r\n\r\nThis professional class was quite distinct from the priests of the\r\nÆsculapian temples, though many writers have confused them. Probably\r\nthe truth is this:—Certain students from reading the votive tablets\r\nin the temples, and examining the persons who came to be cured, gave\r\ntheir attention to the art of medicine, and established themselves\r\nas physicians in the neighbourhood of the temples; for it does not\r\nappear that the priests themselves pretended to medical skill. They\r\nwere the instruments of the divine revelation, the mediums of the\r\nhealing power of the god; they suggested remedies, but did not attempt\r\ntheir application or the treatment of cases. In process of time the\r\npilgrims to the temples would require human aid to supplement the\r\noften disappointing divine assistance, and this the Asclepiadæ were\r\nappointed to supply. Hypnotism was probably practised; music, and such\r\ndrugs as hemlock were also employed which soothe the nervous system and\r\nrelieve pain. The Asclepiadæ took careful notes of the symptoms and\r\nprogress of each case, and were particular to observe the effect of the\r\ntreatment prescribed; they became, in consequence, exceedingly skilful\r\nin prognosis. Galen says that little attention was paid to dietetics by\r\nthe Asclepiads; but Strabo speaks of the knowledge which Hippocrates\r\nderived from the documents in the Asclepion of Cos.[374] Exercise,\r\nespecially on horseback, was one of the measures used by the Asclepiads\r\nfor restoring the health.[375]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS OF THE ASCLEPIADES.\r\n\r\nThe three most famous schools of the Asclepiades were those of Rhodes,\r\nCos, and Cnidos. There were also that of Crotona, in Lower Italy,\r\nestablished by Pythagoras, and the school of Cyrene, in the North of\r\nAfrica. Famous temples of Æsculapius existed at Titanæ, Epidaurus,\r\nOrope, Cyllene, Tithorea, Tricca, Megalopolis, Pergamus, Corinth,\r\nSmyrna, and at many other places.[376]\r\n\r\nA spirit of healthy emulation existed in these different schools, which\r\nwas most advantageous for the progress of medical science. The tone\r\nexisting at this early period amongst the different medical societies\r\nat these institutions is shown in the famous oath which the pupils of\r\nthe Asclepiadæ were compelled to subscribe on completing their course\r\nof instruction in medicine. It is the oldest written monument of the\r\nGreek art of healing.[377]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OATH.\r\n\r\n“I swear by Apollo, the physician, and Æsculapius, and Health, and\r\nPanacea,[378] and all the gods and goddesses, that, according to my\r\nability and judgment, I will keep this oath and this stipulation—to\r\nreckon him who taught me this art equally dear to me as my parents, to\r\nshare my substance with him, and relieve his necessities if required;\r\nto look upon his offspring in the same footing as my own brothers, and\r\nto teach them this art, if they shall wish to learn it, without fee\r\nor stipulation; and that by precept, lecture, and every other mode of\r\ninstruction, I will impart a knowledge of the art to my own sons, and\r\nthose of my teachers, and to disciples bound by a stipulation and oath\r\naccording to the law of medicine, but to none others. I will follow\r\nthat system of regimen which, according to my ability and judgment,\r\nI consider for the benefit of my patient, and abstain from whatever\r\nis deleterious and mischievous. I will give no deadly medicine to any\r\none if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in like manner I will\r\nnot give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion. With purity and\r\nwith holiness I will pass my life and practise my art. I will not cut\r\npersons labouring under the stone, but will leave this to be done by\r\nmen who are practitioners of this work.[379]\r\n\r\n“Into whatever houses I enter, I will go into them for the benefit\r\nof the sick, and will abstain from every voluntary act of mischief\r\nand corruption; and, further, from the seduction of females or males,\r\nof freemen or slaves. Whatever, in connection with my professional\r\npractice, or not in connection with it, I see or hear, in the life of\r\nmen, which ought not to be spoken of abroad, I will not divulge, as\r\nreckoning that all such should be kept secret. While I continue to keep\r\nthis oath unviolated, may it be granted to me to enjoy life and the\r\npractice of the art, respected by all men, in all times! But should I\r\ntrespass and violate this oath, may the reverse be my lot!”\r\n\r\nAncient authorities differ as to the respective order in which the\r\nschools of the Asclepiads should be esteemed. Rhodes, Cos, and Cnidos\r\ncontinually disputed for the pre-eminence, Cos and Cnidos acquiring\r\ngreat fame by their conflicting opinions. According to Galen, the\r\nfirst place must be conceded to Cos, as having produced the greatest\r\nnumber of excellent disciples, amongst whom was Hippocrates; he ranks\r\nCnidos next. Cos (B.C. 600) was the objective school, and devoted its\r\nstudies chiefly to symptomatology. It asked, what can we see of the\r\npatient’s disorder? of what does he complain? what, in fact, are his\r\nsymptoms? This is practical medicine, though not so much in accordance\r\nwith modern scientific medicine as the method of Cnidos, the subjective\r\nschool. There the aim was to make a correct diagnosis; to find out what\r\nwas behind the symptoms, what caused the morbid appearances; what it\r\nwas that the sensations of the patient indicated; and its aim was not\r\nto treat symptoms so much as to treat vigorously the disorder which\r\ncaused them. Auscultation, or the art of scientifically listening\r\nto the sounds of the chest, those of the lungs in breathing, and of\r\nthe heart in beating, was to some extent understood and practised at\r\nCnidos. The medical school of Crotona was in the highest repute 500\r\nB.C., probably on account of its connection with the Pythagoreans. The\r\nschool of Rhodes does not seem to have had a long life.\r\n\r\nThat of Cyrene was famous on account not only of its medical\r\nteaching, but from the fact that mathematics and philosophy were\r\nindustriously pursued there. The teaching in all these schools must\r\nhave been of a very high order; for, though unfortunately little of\r\nit has descended directly to us, we have sufficient evidence of its\r\nimportance in such fragments as are to be found incorporated with the\r\nworks of Hippocrates, such as the _Coan Prognostics_ and the _Cnidian\r\nSentences_; the former, a miscellaneous collection of the observations\r\nmade by the physician of Cos, and the latter, a work attributed to\r\nEuryphon, a celebrated physician of Cnidos (about the former half of\r\nthe fifth century B.C.).\r\n\r\nExperiment and observation were insisted upon in the study of anatomy\r\nand physiology. Galen tells us in his second book, _On Anatomical\r\nManipulations_: “I do not blame the ancients, who did not write books\r\non anatomical manipulations; though I praise Marinus, who did. For\r\nit was superfluous for them to compose such records for themselves\r\nor others, while they were, from their childhood, exercised by their\r\nparents in dissecting, just as familiarly as in writing and reading;\r\nso that there was no more fear of their forgetting their anatomy than\r\nof their forgetting their alphabet. But when grown men, as well as\r\nchildren, were taught, this thorough discipline fell off; and, the art\r\nbeing carried out of the family of the Asclepiads, and declining by\r\nrepeated transmission, books became necessary for the student.”\r\n\r\nThe method of the Asclepiadæ was one of true induction; much was\r\nimperfect in their efforts to arrive at the beginning of medical\r\nscience. They had little light, and often stumbled; but they made the\r\nbest use of what they had, and with all their deviations they always\r\nreturned to the right path, and kept their faces towards the light.\r\nHippocrates was of them; and Bacon of Verulam, in the centuries to\r\ncome, followed and developed the same method. Dr. Adams remarks the\r\nassiduous observation and abundant rational experience which led them\r\nto enunciate such a law of nature as this: “Those things which bring\r\nalleviation with bad signs, and do not remit with good, are troublesome\r\nand difficult.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCTESIAS, of Cnidus, in Caria, was a physician at the court of King\r\nArtaxerxes Mnemon. He may be called a contemporary of Herodotus. It is\r\npossible that, according to Diodorus, he was a prisoner of war while\r\nin Persia, though the well-known fact that Greek physicians were in\r\ngreat request, and were always received there with favour, is quite\r\nsufficient to account for his presence in that country. He wrote a\r\nhistory of Persia and a treatise on India, containing many statements\r\nformerly considered doubtful, but now proved to be founded on facts.\r\n\r\nThe persons who anointed the bodies of the athletes of ancient Greece,\r\npreparatory to their entering the gymnasia, were called ALIPTÆ.\r\nThese persons taught gymnastic exercises, practised many operations\r\nof surgery, and undertook the treatment of trifling diseases. The\r\nexternal use of oil was intended to close the pores of the skin, so as\r\nto prevent excessive perspiration. The oil was mixed with sand, and\r\nwas well rubbed into the skin. After the exercises, the athletes were\r\nagain anointed, to restore the tone of the muscles. The aliptæ would\r\nnaturally acquire considerable knowledge of the accidents and maladies\r\nto which the human body was subject; accordingly, we find that they\r\nnot only undertook the treatment of fractures and dislocations, but\r\nbecame the regular medical advisers of their patrons. ICCUS of Tarentum\r\ndevoted himself to dietetics. They were probably a superior class of\r\ntrainers. HERODICUS of Selymbria, a teacher of Hippocrates, treated\r\ndiseases by exercises. He is said to have been the first to demand a\r\nfee in place of the presents which were given by patients formerly\r\nto their doctors.[380] The gymnasia were dedicated to Apollo, the\r\ngod of physicians.[381] The directors of the institutions regulated\r\nthe diet of the young men, the sub-directors prescribed for their\r\ndiseases.[382] The inferiors, or bathers, bled, gave clysters, and\r\ndressed wounds.[383]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE MEDICINE OF HIPPOCRATES AND HIS PERIOD.\r\n\r\n Hippocrates first delivered Medicine from the Thraldom of\r\n Superstition.—Dissection of the Human Body and Rise of\r\n Anatomy.—Hippocrates, Father of Medicine and Surgery.—The Law.—Plato.\r\n\r\n\r\nHippocrates, the “Father of Medicine,” was born at Cos,[384] 460\r\nB.C. On his father’s side he was believed to be descended from\r\nÆsculapius, and through his mother from Hercules. A member of the\r\nfamily of the Asclepiadæ, of a descent of three hundred years, he\r\nhad the advantage of studying medicine under his father, Heraclides,\r\nin the Asclepion of Cos. Herodicus of Selymbria taught him medical\r\ngymnastics, and Democritus of Abdera and Gorgias of Leontini were\r\nhis masters in literature and philosophy. He travelled widely, and\r\ntaught and practised at Athens, dying at an age variously stated as\r\n85, 90, 104, and 109. Fortunate in the opportunities offered by his\r\nbirth and position, he was still more fortunate in his time—the age\r\nof Pericles—in which Greece reached its noblest development, and the\r\narts and sciences achieved their greatest triumphs. It was the age of\r\nSocrates, Plato, Xenophon, Euripides, Sophocles, Æschylus, Pindar,\r\nAristophanes, Herodotus, Thucydides, and Phidias. Philosophy, poetry,\r\nliterature, and sculpture found in these great minds their most perfect\r\nexponents. Medicine, in the person of Hippocrates, was to find its\r\nfirst and most distinguished author-physician.\r\n\r\nThe Father of Medicine was therefore the worthy product of his\r\nremarkable age. The genius which culminated in the works of the\r\ngolden age of Greece could scarcely have left medicine without her\r\nHippocrates; the harmony otherwise would have been incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe following genealogy of Hippocrates has been given by Tzetzes, but\r\nMr. Grote says it is wholly mythical:—\r\n\r\nÆsculapius was the father of Podalirius, who was the father of\r\nHippolochus, who was the father of Sostratus, who was the father of\r\nCleomyttades, who was the father of Theodorus, who was the father of\r\nSostratus II., who was the father of Theodorus II., who was the father\r\nof Sostratus III., who was the father of Nebrus, who was the father of\r\nGnosidicus, who was the father of Hippocrates I., who was the father of\r\nHeraclides, who was the father of Hippocrates II., otherwise called the\r\nGreat Hippocrates.\r\n\r\nHippocrates was the first physician who delivered medicine from the\r\nthraldom of superstition and the sophistries of philosophers, and\r\ngave it an independent existence. It was impossible that our science\r\nshould make progress so long as men believed that disease was caused\r\nby an angry demon or an offended divinity, and was only to be cured\r\nby expelling the one or propitiating the other. Hippocrates, with a\r\ndiscernment and a courage which was marvellous, considering his time,\r\ndeclared that no disease whatever came from the gods, but was in every\r\ninstance traceable to a natural and intelligible cause. Before the\r\nAsclepiadæ there was no medical science; before Hippocrates there was\r\nno one mind with vision wide enough to take in all that had been done\r\nbefore—to select the precious from the worthless and embody it in a\r\nliterature which remains to the present time a model of conciseness\r\nand condensation, and a practical text-book on all that concerns the\r\nart of healing as it was understood in his time. The minuteness of\r\nhis observations, his rational, and accurate interpretation of all he\r\nsaw, and his simple, methodical, truthful, and lucid descriptions of\r\neverything which he has recorded excite the admiration and compel the\r\npraise of all who have studied the works which he has left. Nor are\r\nhis candour, honesty, caution, and experience less to be extolled. He\r\nconfesses his errors, fully explains the measures adopted to cure his\r\ncases, and candidly admits that in one series of forty-two patients\r\nwhom he attended only seventeen recovered, the others having perished\r\nin spite of the means he had proposed to save them. He was probably\r\nthe first public teacher of the healing-art; his counsels were not\r\nwhispered in the secret meetings of sacerdotal assemblies. He was the\r\nfirst to disclose the secrets of the art to the world; to strip it of\r\nthe veil of mystery with which countless generations of magicians,\r\nthaumaturgists, and priestly healers had shrouded it, and to stand\r\nbefore his pupils to give oral instruction in anatomy and the other\r\nbranches of his profession. Had he not been the Father of Medicine,\r\nhe would have been known as one of the greatest of the philosophers.\r\nHe first recognised Φύσις—Nature in the treatment of disease. Nature,\r\nhe declared, was all-sufficient for our healing. She knows of herself\r\nall that is necessary for us, and so he called her “the just.” He\r\nattributed to her a faculty, Δύναμις; physicians are but her servants.\r\nThe governing faculty, Δύναμις, nourishes, preserves, and increases all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nGalen states that the greater part of Aristotle’s physiology was\r\ntaken from Hippocrates. It has been the custom to make light of his\r\nanatomical knowledge, and to say that in face of the difficulty, if\r\nnot impossibility, of procuring subjects for dissection, he could have\r\nhad but little exact knowledge of the human body; but it is certain\r\nthat by some means or other he must have dissected it. In proof of this\r\nit is only necessary to mention his treatise _On the Articulations_,\r\nespecially that part of it which relates to the dislocation of the\r\nshoulder joint. Dr. Adams, in one of his valuable notes on the works of\r\nHippocrates,[385] says: “The language of our author in this place puts\r\nit beyond all doubt that human dissection was practised in his age.” In\r\nAshurst’s _International Encyclopædia of Surgery_[386] his descriptions\r\nof all dislocations are declared to be wonderfully accurate; and the\r\nwriter adds that it is the greatest error imaginable to suppose,\r\nwith the common conceit of our day, that all ingenious and useful\r\nimprovements in surgery belong to the present age. In the treatise on\r\nthe Sacred Disease (epilepsy), his description of the brain in man\r\nproves that he was acquainted with its dissection.\r\n\r\nIn the treatise on the heart, again, the construction of that organ\r\nin the human body is referred to. Other allusions to the internal\r\nstructure of the human frame in the Hippocratic treatises serve to\r\nconfirm our opinion; and if it be objected that some of these are\r\nprobably not genuine, they must at least be as old as his period,\r\nand it was far more likely that he should have written or inspired\r\nthem than that they should have emanated from an inferior source.\r\nThose who argue to the contrary do so on the same grounds as the\r\nGreek commentators, who say that the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ were not\r\nwritten by Homer, but by some other poet of the same name. Dr. Adams\r\nis confident, from his familiarity with the works of Hippocrates, that\r\nthe knowledge of human anatomy exhibited therein had its origin in\r\nactual dissection, and he adds that: “I do not at present recollect a\r\nsingle instance of mistake committed by him in any of his anatomical\r\ndescriptions, if we except that with regard to the sutures of the head,\r\nand even in that case I have endeavoured to show that the meaning of\r\nthe passage is very equivocal.”[387] There is no doubt, in fact, that a\r\ngreat deal more human dissection went on than the Greek doctors dared\r\nto acknowledge for fear of exciting popular prejudice. Less than a\r\nhundred years after the death of Hippocrates there was abundant and\r\nopen dissection of the human body in the schools of Alexandria, and it\r\nis incredible that the practice only received popular sanction at that\r\nparticular time. Yet the anatomy of Hippocrates was very imperfect.\r\nThe nerves, sinews, and ligaments were confounded together, all being\r\nclassed as νεῦρον or τόνος.\r\n\r\nThe blood-vessels were supposed to contain both blood and air, and were\r\ncalled φλέβες; the trachea was called an “artery.”\r\n\r\nThe brain was considered as merely a gland which condenses the\r\nascending vapours into mucus. The office of the nerves was to convey\r\nthe animal spirits throughout the body. We must not forget that the\r\nscience of anatomy was extremely imperfect even at the beginning of the\r\npresent century.\r\n\r\n“When,” says Littré,[388] “one searches into the history of medicine\r\nand the commencement of the science, the first body of doctrine that\r\none meets with is the collection of writings known under the name\r\nof the works of Hippocrates. The science mounts up directly to that\r\norigin, and there stops. Not that it had not been cultivated earlier,\r\nand had not given rise to even numerous productions; but everything\r\nthat had been made before the physician of Cos has perished. We have\r\nonly remaining of them scattered and unconnected fragments. The works\r\nof Hippocrates have alone escaped destruction; and by a singular\r\ncircumstance there exists a great gap after them as well as before\r\nthem. The medical works from Hippocrates to the establishment of the\r\nschool of Alexandria, and those of that school itself, are completely\r\nlost, except some quotations and passages preserved in the later\r\nwriters; so that the writings of Hippocrates remain alone amongst the\r\nruins of ancient medical literature.”\r\n\r\nIt is vain to inquire how Hippocrates acquired a knowledge which seems\r\nto us so far in advance of his age. Was Greek wisdom derived from the\r\nEast, or was its philosophy the offspring of the soil of Hellas? Such\r\nquestions have often been discussed, but to little purpose. There would\r\nseem to be every reason to suppose that Greek medicine was indigenous.\r\nWe have no means of knowing how long philosophy and medicine had been\r\nunited before the time of Hippocrates. The honour of affecting the\r\nalliance has been ascribed to Pythagoras.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Greek philosophers speculated about medicine. We have\r\nseen that besides Pythagoras, Empedocles and Democritus did so,\r\nalthough it is not probable that they followed it as a profession. The\r\nAsclepiadæ probably brought medicine to a high state of perfection, but\r\nthe work these priest-physicians did is a sealed book to us. All was\r\ndarkness till Hippocrates appeared.\r\n\r\nIn his treatise _On Ancient Medicine_, he says that men first learned\r\nfrom experience the science of dietetics; they were compelled to\r\nascertain the properties of vegetable productions as articles of\r\nfood. Then they learned that the food which is suitable in health\r\nis unsuitable in sickness, and thus they applied themselves to the\r\ndiscovery of the proper rules of diet in disease; and it was the\r\naccumulation of the facts bearing on this subject which was the origin\r\nof the art of medicine. “The basis of his system was a rational\r\nexperience, and not a blind empiricism; so that the empirics in after\r\nages had no good grounds for claiming him as belonging to their\r\nsect.”[389]\r\n\r\nHe assiduously applied himself to the study of the natural history of\r\ndiseases, especially with the view to determine their tendencies to\r\ndeath or recovery. In every case he asked himself what would be the\r\nprobable end of the disorder if left to itself. Prognosis, then, is\r\none of the chief characteristics of Hippocratic medicine. He hated\r\nall charlatanism, and was free from all popular superstition. When we\r\nreflect on the medicine of the most highly civilized nations which we\r\nhave considered at length in the preceding pages, and remember how full\r\nof absurdities, of magic, amulet lore, and other things calculated\r\nto impose on the credulity of the people, were their attempts at\r\nhealing, we shall be inclined to say, that the most wonderful thing\r\nin the history of Hippocrates was his complete divorce from the evil\r\ntraditions of the past. Although he forsook philosophy as an ally\r\nof medicine, his system was founded in the physical philosophy of\r\nthe elements which the ancient Greeks propounded, and which we have\r\nattempted to explain. There was an all-pervading spiritual essence\r\nwhich is ever striving to maintain all things in their natural\r\ncondition; ever rectifying their derangements; ever restoring them to\r\nthe original and perfect pattern. He called that spiritual essence\r\nNature. “Nature is the physician of diseases.”[390] Here, then, we have\r\nthe enunciation of the doctrine of the _Vis Medicatrix Naturæ_. In his\r\nattempts to aid Nature, the physician must regulate his treatment “to\r\ndo good, or at least, to do no harm”;[391] yet he bled, cupped, and\r\nscarified. In constipation he prescribed laxative drugs, as mercury\r\n(not the mineral, of course, but _Mercurialis perennis_), beet, and\r\ncabbage, also elaterium, scammony, and other powerful cathartics. He\r\nused white hellebore boldly, and when narcotics were required had\r\nrecourse to mandragora, henbane, and probably to poppy-juice.\r\n\r\nHe is said to have been the discoverer of the principles of derivation\r\nand revulsion in the treatment of diseases.[392]\r\n\r\nSydenham called Hippocrates “the Romulus of medicine, whose heaven\r\nwas the empyrean of his art. He it is whom we can never duly praise.”\r\nHe terms him “that divine old man,” and declares that he laid the\r\nimmovable foundations of the whole superstructure of medicine when he\r\ntaught that _our natures are the physicians of our diseases_.[393]\r\n\r\nHe was Father of Surgery as well as of medicine. Eight of his seventeen\r\ngenuine works are strictly surgical. By an ingenious arrangement of\r\napparatus he was enabled to practise extension and counter-extension.\r\nHe insisted on the most exact co-aptation of fractured bones, declaring\r\nthat it was disgraceful to allow a patient to recover with a crooked\r\nor shortened limb. His splints were probably quite as good as ours,\r\nand his bandaging left nothing to be desired. When the ends of the\r\nbones projected in cases of compound fractures, they were carefully\r\nresected. In fracture of the skull with depressed bone the trepan\r\nwas used, and in cases where blood or pus had accumulated they were\r\nskilfully evacuated. He boldly and freely opened abscesses of the\r\nliver and kidneys. The thoracic cavity was explored by percussion and\r\nauscultation for detection of fluids, and when they were discovered\r\nparacentesis (tapping) was performed. This was also done in cases of\r\nabdominal dropsies. The rectum was examined by an appropriate speculum,\r\nfistula-in-ano was treated by the ligature, and hæmorrhoids were\r\noperated upon. Stiff leather shoes and an admirable system of bandaging\r\nwere employed in cases of talipes. The bladder was explored by sounds\r\nfor the detection of calculi; gangrenous and mangled limbs were\r\namputated; the dead fœtus was extracted from the mother. Venesection,\r\nscarification, and cupping were all employed.[394]\r\n\r\nHe resected bones at the joints. In the treatment of ulcers he used\r\nsulphate of copper, sulphate of zinc, verdigris, lead, sulphur,\r\narsenic, alum, etc. He came very near indeed to the antiseptic system\r\nin surgery when he made use of “raw tar water” (a crude sort of\r\ncarbolic acid, in fact) in the treatment of wounds. Suppositories were\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Adams’ _Life of Hippocrates_,[395] he says: “In surgery he\r\nwas a bold operator. He fearlessly, and as we would now think, in\r\nsome cases unnecessarily, perforated the skull with the trepan and\r\nthe trephine in injuries of the head. He opened the chest also in\r\nempyema and hydrothorax. His extensive practice, and no doubt his great\r\nfamiliarity with the accidents occurring at the public games of his\r\ncountry, must have furnished him with ample opportunities of becoming\r\nacquainted with dislocations and fractures of all kinds; and how well\r\nhe had profited by the opportunities which he thus enjoyed, every page\r\nof his treatises _On Fractures_ and _On the Articulations_ abundantly\r\ntestifies. In fact, until within a very recent period, the modern plan\r\nof treatment in such cases was not at all to be compared with his\r\nskilful mode of adjusting fractured bones, and of securing them with\r\nwaxed bandages. In particular, his description of the accidents which\r\noccur at the elbow and hip-joints will be allowed, even at the present\r\nday, to display a most wonderful acquaintance with the subject. In\r\nthe treatment of dislocations, when human strength was not sufficient\r\nto restore the displacement, he skilfully availed himself of all the\r\nmechanical powers which were then known. In his views with regard to\r\nthe nature of club-foot, it might have been affirmed of him a few years\r\nago that he was twenty-four centuries in advance of his profession,\r\nwhen he stated that in this case there is no dislocation, but merely a\r\ndeclination of the foot; and that in infancy, by means of methodical\r\nbandaging, a cure may in most cases be effected without any surgical\r\noperation. In a word, until the days of Delpech and Stromeyer, no\r\none entertained ideas so sound and scientific on the nature of this\r\ndeformity as Hippocrates.”\r\n\r\nDr. Adams, recapitulating the general results of the investigations as\r\nto the genuineness of the Hippocratic books, states that a considerable\r\nportion of them are not the work of Hippocrates himself. The works\r\nalmost universally admitted to be genuine are: _The Prognostics_, _On\r\nAirs_, etc., _On Regimen in Acute Diseases_, seven of the books of\r\n_Aphorisms_, _Epidemics_, I. and III., _On the Articulations_, _On\r\nFractures_, _On the Instruments of Reduction_, _The Oath_.\r\n\r\nThe following are almost certainly genuine: _On Ancient Medicine_, _On\r\nthe Surgery_, _The Law_, _On Ulcers_, _On Fistulæ_, _On Hæmorrhoids_,\r\n_On the Sacred Disease_.[396]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW.\r\n\r\n1. Medicine is of all the arts the most noble; but owing to the\r\nignorance of those who practise it, and of those who, inconsiderately,\r\nform a judgment of them, it is at present far behind all the other\r\narts. Their mistake appears to me to arise principally from this, that\r\nin the cities there is no punishment connected with the practice of\r\nmedicine (and with it alone) except disgrace, and that does not hurt\r\nthose who are familiar with it. Such persons are like the figures[397]\r\nwhich are introduced in tragedies, for as they have the shape, and\r\ndress, and personal appearance of an actor, but are not actors, so also\r\nphysicians are many in title but very few in quality.\r\n\r\n2. Whoever is to acquire a competent knowledge of medicine, ought\r\nto be possessed of the following advantages: a natural disposition;\r\ninstruction; a favourable position for the study; early tuition; love\r\nof labour; leisure. First of all, a natural talent is required; for\r\nwhen nature opposes, everything else is vain; but when nature leads\r\nthe way to what is most excellent, instruction in the art takes place,\r\nwhich the student must try to appropriate to himself by reflection,\r\nbecoming an early pupil in a place well adapted for instruction. He\r\nmust also bring to the task a love of labour and perseverance, so that\r\nthe instruction taking root may bring forth proper and abundant fruits.\r\n\r\n3. Instruction in medicine is like the culture of the productions of\r\nthe earth. For our natural disposition is, as it were, the soil; the\r\ntenets of our teacher are, as it were, the seed; instruction in youth\r\nis like the planting of the seed in the ground at the proper season;\r\nthe place where the instruction is communicated is like the food\r\nimparted to vegetables by the atmosphere; diligent study is like the\r\ncultivation of the fields; and it is time which imparts strength to all\r\nthings and brings them to maturity.\r\n\r\n4. Having brought all these requisites to the study of medicine, and\r\nhaving acquired a true knowledge of it, we shall then, in travelling\r\nthrough the cities, be esteemed physicians not only in name but in\r\nreality. But inexperience is a bad treasure, and a bad friend to\r\nthose who possess it, whether in opinion or reality, being devoid of\r\nself-reliance and contentedness, and the nurse both of timidity and\r\naudacity. For timidity betrays a want of power, and audacity a want of\r\nskill. There are, indeed, two things, knowledge and opinion, of which\r\nthe one makes its possessor really to know, the other to be ignorant.\r\n\r\n5. Those things which are sacred are to be imparted only to sacred\r\npersons; and it is not lawful to impart them to the profane until they\r\nhave been initiated in the mysteries of the science.\r\n\r\nThe “Hippocratic collections” of works which have been attributed to\r\nHippocrates, but the greater part of which were neither written by him,\r\nnor compiled from notes taken by his students, consists of eighty-seven\r\ntreatises.\r\n\r\nHippocrates believed in the influence of the imagination of pregnant\r\nwomen on the child in the womb. He forbad nurses to eat food of\r\nan acrid, salt, or acid nature, and observed that infants during\r\nthe period of dentition were liable to fevers, bowel troubles, and\r\nconvulsions, especially if there was constipation. He mentions thrush\r\nas one of the diseases of dentition (_De Dent._). He recommends\r\nfriction for contracting or relaxing the body according as it is\r\napplied in a hard or soft manner. Very fully he discourses on the evil\r\neffects of plethora, and recommends purging, emetics, warm baths, and\r\nbleeding, for reducing the system (_De Dietol._, iii. 16 _et seq._).\r\nHe constantly advises gentle purgatives as a means of keeping the\r\nbody in health. His favourite laxative medicine was the herb mercury.\r\nThe administration of clysters is recommended; this treatment was\r\nevidently derived from the Egyptians. What are called errhines or\r\nsternutatories—_i.e._, medicines which, applied to the nose, excite\r\nsneezing—were described by Hippocrates as medicines which purge the\r\nhead. Though he fully describes the effects of baths, he speaks\r\nunfavourably of thermal springs as being hard and heating. He insists\r\nthat the diet should be full in winter and spare in summer (_Aphor._,\r\ni. 18). He disapproves of the habit of eating a full dinner (_De Vet.\r\nMed._). He condemns the use of new bread. The nutritious properties of\r\npulse in general are insisted upon. He calls the flesh of fowls one\r\nof the lightest kinds of food (_De Affect._, 46), and says that eggs\r\nare nutritious, and strengthening, but flatulent. He remarks that the\r\nflesh of wild animals is more digestible than that of domesticated.\r\nHe objects to goat’s flesh as having all the bad qualities of beef,\r\nwhich he calls a strong, astringent, and indigestible article of diet.\r\nMilk, he says, sometimes causes the formation of stones in the bladder\r\n(_De Ær. Aquis et Locis_, 24). Dr. Francis Adams says this opinion was\r\nadopted by all the ancient physicians. Cheese he considers flatulent\r\nand indigestible. Fishes are light food; sea fish are lighter and\r\nbetter for delicate persons than fresh-water fish (_De Affect._, 46).\r\nHoney, when eaten with other food, is nutritious, but is injurious when\r\ntaken alone.\r\n\r\nHippocrates opposed all hypothesis in medicine, and grounded his\r\nopinions on disease on actual observation. He insisted that the\r\nessence of fever is heat mixed up with noxious qualities. He was\r\nthe great master of prognostics. His work _Prorrhetica and Coacæ_,\r\nsays Dr. Francis Adams, “contains a rich treasure of observations\r\nwhich cannot be too much explored by the student of medicine. His\r\nprognostics are founded upon the appearance of the face, eyes, tongue,\r\nthe voice, hearing, the state of the hypochondriac region, the abdomen,\r\nthe general system, sleep, respiration, and the excretions. We can\r\ndo little more, in this place, than express our high sense of the\r\nvalue of the _Hippocratic Treatises on Prognostics_, and recommend\r\nthe study of them to all members of the profession who would wish\r\nto learn the true inductive system of cultivating medicine.” (_The\r\nSeven Books of Paulus Ægineta_, by Francis Adams.) The state of the\r\ncountenance which immediately precedes death is called by physicians\r\nthe _Facies Hippocratica_, because Hippocrates described it, calling\r\nit πρόσωποι διαφθορή (_Coac. Prænot._, 212). The nose is sharp, the\r\neyes hollow, the temples sunk, the ears cold and contracted, and their\r\nlobes inverted; the skin about the forehead hard, tense, and dry; the\r\ncountenance pale, greenish, or dark. In fevers he was greatly attached\r\nto the importance of the critical days. Galen adopted his list of\r\ncritical days with little alteration. Hippocrates does not seem to\r\nhave paid much attention to the pulse, or if he did he attached little\r\nimportance to it; even in describing epidemical fevers he neglects to\r\nmention the characteristics of the pulse. Galen, however, affirms that\r\nhe was not altogether ignorant of it. He quite correctly described the\r\ncharacteristics of healthy stools, and pointed out that they should\r\nin colour be yellowish, if too yellow there is too much bile, if not\r\nyellow at all there was a stoppage of the passage of bile to the\r\nintestines. His indications from the state of the urine are not less\r\nvaluable. How wise are his observations on the treatment of febrile\r\ndiseases! “To be able to tell what had preceded them; to know the\r\npresent state and foretell the future; to have two objects in view,\r\neither to do good or at least do no harm” (_Epidem._, i. 7). He it was\r\nwho formulated the rule all physicians have since followed that a fluid\r\ndiet is proper in all febrile affections. He advised cold sponging in\r\nardent fevers—a method of treatment recently revived and of great value\r\n(_De Rat. Vict. Acut._). He laid it down that diseases in general may\r\nbe said to arise either from the food we eat or the air we breathe. In\r\ncases of fever he allowed his patients to drink freely of barley-water\r\nand cold acidulated drinks. In this he was much in advance of the\r\nmedical science of the time. He has described cases of “brain fever,”\r\none of the few complaints which novelists permit their heroes to suffer\r\nfrom. They appear to have been cases of remittent fever rather than\r\ntrue inflammation of the brain. We may estimate the wonderful extent\r\nof the medical science of Hippocrates by the fact that he vigorously\r\nopposed the popular belief of the period, that epilepsy was due to\r\ndemoniacal influence. He explains that the lower animals are subject\r\nto the same disorder, and that in them it is often associated with\r\nwater in the brain. There is really no doubt that the _morbus sacer_ of\r\nthe ancients and the cases of demoniacal possession of which we read\r\nwere cases of epilepsy (_Hippoc. de Morbo Sacro_). Concerning apoplexy\r\nhe says that a slight attack is difficult to cure, and a severe one\r\nutterly incurable. The cause of the attack he considered was turgidity\r\nof the veins. We know it to be often associated with cerebral\r\nhæmorrhage or sanguineous apoplexy and sometimes with effusion of serum\r\n= serous apoplexy. Hippocrates therefore came very near the truth. He\r\nadvised bleeding, which is still recommended but is not often practised\r\nin England; and he very justly said that the malady occurs most\r\nfrequently between the age of forty and sixty (_Aphoris._, ii. 42). In\r\ncertain forms of ophthalmia he advises free purgation, bleeding, and\r\nthe use of wine; and this accords with the best modern practice, if for\r\nvenesection, we substitute vesication. His treatment of nasal polypus\r\nby the ligature is not unlike our own; and nothing could be better\r\nthan his plan for dealing with quinsey and allied complaints, viz.,\r\nhot fomentations, warm gargles and tinctures, with free purgation. He\r\ndisapproves of a practice too often followed by surgeons to-day, of\r\nscarifying the tonsils when swollen and red. In cases of inflammation\r\nof the lungs he advised bleeding, purging, and cooling drinks. Laënnec,\r\nthe great French physician, who invented the stethoscope, highly\r\npraises Hippocrates for his knowledge of phthisis, and the diagnostic\r\nvalue of his tests of the nature of the sputa in that disease. In cases\r\nof empyema, or the formation and accumulation of pus in the chest, he\r\ndirects us to make an incision into the pleural cavity—an operation\r\nwhich has been revived in modern times under the name of “paracentesis\r\nthoracis.”\r\n\r\nHe declares the loss of hair and the diarrhœa of phthisis to be fatal\r\nsigns, and his description of hydrothorax, or dropsy of the chest,\r\nhas been highly praised by the greatest authorities. He says that\r\nphthisis is most common between the ages of eighteen and thirty-six\r\n(see _Hippoc. de Morbis_, ii. 45; _Coacæ Prænat., et alibi_). For\r\npleurisy his treatment is practically the same as that followed at\r\nthe present day. He advised the administration of flour and milk in\r\ndiarrhœa—an exceedingly useful remedy—and treated the pains of colic by\r\nwarm injections, warm baths, fomentations, soporifics and purgatives,\r\nas the case might require. He was wise enough to know that stone of\r\nthe bladder was a product of a morbid condition of the urine, and\r\nsaid that when it had fairly formed nothing but an operation for its\r\nremoval was of any value. He recognised the disease known as hydatids\r\nof the liver, and directed that abscesses of that organ should be\r\nopened by the cautery. His account of the causes and treatment of\r\ndropsy is fairly accurate according to our present knowledge. He\r\napproved of paracentesis abdominis (tapping) in cases of ascites, and\r\ndescribes the operation. He recognised the incurability of true cancer.\r\nMany of his treatises on the disorders of women prove that they were\r\nwell understood in his day, and on the whole were properly treated.\r\nDifficult labour was managed not so differently from our modern methods\r\nas might be supposed. His account of hip-joint disease is remarkably\r\naccurate. Gout was well understood by our author, and probably his\r\ntreatment by purgation and careful dieting was on the whole as\r\nsuccessful as our own.\r\n\r\nHippocrates speaks of leprosy as more a blemish than a disease; it\r\nis probable, however, that the works in which he is supposed to\r\nallude to it are not genuine. He points out the danger of opening\r\nthe round tumour on tendons, called a ganglion. In his book called\r\n_Prognostics_, he refers to the danger of an erysipelas being\r\ntranslated to an internal part. Cold applications, he says, are useful\r\nin this disease when there is no ulceration, but prejudicial when\r\nulceration is present. Struma or scrofula is described by Hippocrates\r\n(_De Glandulis_) as being one of the worst diseases of the neck. In\r\nthe treatise (_De Ulceribus_) on ulcers, he particularly praises wine\r\nas a lotion for ulcers, and there is good reason to believe that we\r\nmight advantageously revert to this treatment. Some of the drugs\r\nwhich he recommends for foul ulcers, such as frankincense and myrrh,\r\nare excellent, and owe their efficacy to their “newly discovered”\r\nantiseptic action. He recommends also arsenic and verdigris. The\r\nactual cautery or burning applied freely to the head is recommended\r\nin diseases of the eyes and other complaints. He describes water on\r\nthe brain in the treatise _De Morbis_, ii. 15, and even recommends\r\nperforation of the skull or trephining quite in the modern way. Opening\r\nthe temporal veins is advised for obstinate headaches. Although no\r\nexpress treatise on bleeding is found amongst the works of Hippocrates,\r\nhe practised venesection freely in various diseases. He forbids the\r\nsurgeon to interfere with non-ulcerated cancers, adding that if the\r\ncancer be healed the patient soon dies, while if let alone he may live\r\na long time (_Aph._, vi. 38). He warns us that the sudden evacuation of\r\nthe matter of empyema or of the water in dropsy proves fatal. He speaks\r\nof evacuating the fluid with an instrument similar to that which we\r\ncall a trochar. He approves of scarification of the ankles in dropsy\r\nof the lower extremities; this is quite modern treatment. In cases of\r\ndislocation of the hip-joint from the formation of a collection of\r\nhumours, he recommends burning so as to dry up the redundant humours.\r\nHe minutely describes the cure of fistula with the ligature in his work\r\n_De Fistulis_, which, even if not a genuine treatise of Hippocrates, is\r\nextremely ancient, and was considered authentic by Galen. Hæmorrhoids\r\nor piles are to be ligatured with very thick thread, or destroyed with\r\nred-hot irons. Varicose veins are to be treated by small punctures,\r\nnot freely opened (_De Ulceribus_, 16). Hippocrates considered the\r\nextraction of weapons to be one of the most important departments of\r\nsurgery. In his treatise _De Medico_, he says that surgery can only be\r\nproperly learned by attaching one’s self to the army. Homer said,—\r\n\r\n    “The man of medicine can in worth with many warriors vie,\r\n    Who knows the weapons to excise, and soothing salves apply.”\r\n\r\nHippocrates treats of fractures in his books _De Fracturis_ (_De\r\nArticulis_; _De Vulner. Capit._; _Officina Medici_). He insists that\r\nno injuries to the head are to be considered as trifling; even wounds\r\nof the scalp may prove dangerous if neglected. Fissures, contusions,\r\nand fractures of the cranium are minutely explained and appropriate\r\ntreatment suggested. He describes the trephine under the name of\r\nτρύπανον, _i.e._ the trepan. He says that convulsions are the frequent\r\nconsequence of head injuries, and that they occur on the opposite\r\nside of the body to that in which the brain injury is seated. One of\r\nthe most valuable legacies of the ancients is this profoundly learned\r\ntreatise of the Father of Medicine, and it proves to us how high a\r\npoint the surgery of ancient Greece had reached. He noticed a certain\r\nmovement of the brain during respiration, a swelling up in expiration\r\nand a falling down during inspiration; and although several great\r\nauthorities of the past denied the accuracy of this observation, it has\r\nsince been shown to be perfectly correct. (See _Paulus Ægineta_, Dr. F.\r\nAdams’ edit., vol. ii. p. 442.) In cases of fracture of the lower jaw,\r\nour author directs that the teeth separated at the broken part are to\r\nbe fastened together and bound with gold wire. So accurately does he\r\ndescribe this fracture that Paulus Ægineta transcribes it almost word\r\nfor word from the _De Articulus_. His method of treating fracture of\r\nthe clavicle is admirable; in fracture of the ribs he observes that\r\nwhen the broken ends of the bone are not pushed inwards, it seldom\r\nhappens that any unpleasant symptoms supervene. In fractures of the arm\r\nhe minutely and precisely indicates the correct principles on which\r\nthey are to be treated, and insists strongly on the necessity of having\r\nthe arm and wrist carefully suspended in a broad soft sling, and that\r\nthe hand be placed neither too high nor too low. Hippocrates could\r\nlearn very little from our modern surgeons in the treatment of such\r\ninjuries. In cases of broken thigh he has indicated all the dangers and\r\ndifficulties attending the management of this accident; his splints and\r\nbandages are applied much as we apply them at the present time, and his\r\nsuggestions for ensuring a well-united bone without deformity of the\r\nlimb are invaluable. In fractures of the thigh and leg-bones he lays\r\ngreat stress on the attention necessary to the state of the heel. In\r\nthose of the foot he warns against the danger of attempting to walk too\r\nsoon. In compound fractures compresses of wine and oil are to be used,\r\nand splints are not to be applied till the wound puts on a healthy\r\nappearance. He is fully aware of the peculiarly dangerous character\r\nof such injuries, and his observations read like extracts from a\r\nmodern text-book of surgery. “No author,” says Dr. Francis Adams,\r\nthe learned translator of the works of Paulus Ægineta, “has given so\r\ncomplete a view of the accidents to which the elbow joint is subject as\r\nHippocrates.”\r\n\r\nPLATO (B.C. 427-347) in its philosophical aspect studied medicine,\r\nnot with any idea of practising the art, but merely as a speculative\r\ncontemplation. The human soul is an emanation from the absolute\r\nintelligence. The world is composed of the four elements. Fire\r\nconsists of pyramidal, earth of cubical, air of octagonal, and water\r\nof twenty-sided atoms. Besides these is the æther. Everything in the\r\nbody has in view the spirit. The heart is the seat of the mind, the\r\nlungs cool the heart, the liver serves the lower desires and is useful\r\nfor divination. The spleen is the abode for the impurities of the\r\nblood. The intestines serve to detain the food, so that it might not be\r\nnecessary to be constantly taking nourishment. The inward pressure of\r\nthe air accounts for the breathing. The muscles and bones protect the\r\nmarrow against heat and cold. The marrow consists of triangles, and the\r\nbrain is the most perfect form of marrow. When the soul is separated\r\nfrom the marrow, death occurs. Sight is caused by the union of the\r\nlight which flows into and out of the eyes, hearing in the shock of air\r\ncommunicated to the brain and the blood. Taste is due to a solution\r\nof sapid atoms by means of small vessels, which vessels conduct the\r\ndissolved atoms to the heart and soul. Smell is very transitory,\r\nnot being founded on any external image. The uterus is a wild beast\r\nexciting inordinate desires. Disease is caused by a disturbance of\r\nthe quantity and quality of the fluids. Inflammations are due to\r\naberrations of the bile. The various fevers are due to the influence of\r\nthe elements. Mental diseases are the results of bodily maladies and\r\nbad education. Diseases fly away before appropriate drugs. Physicians\r\nmust be the rulers of the sick in order to cure them, but they must not\r\nbe money-makers.[398]\r\n\r\nIn the _Republic of Plato_, Book III., we find that medical aid was\r\nlargely in request in Greece to relieve the indolent and voluptuous\r\nfrom the consequences of self-indulgence. It was thought by Socrates\r\ndisgraceful to compel the clever sons of Asclepius to attend to such\r\ndiseases as flatulence and catarrh; it seemed ridiculous to the\r\nphilosopher to pay so much attention to regimen and diet as to drag\r\non a miserable existence as an invalid in the doctor’s hands. When a\r\ncarpenter was ill, he expected his doctor to cure him with an emetic or\r\na purge, the cautery or an operation; if he were ordered a long course\r\nof diet, he would tell his doctor that he had no time to be ill, and\r\nhe would go about his business regardless of consequences. Æsculapius,\r\nit was maintained, revealed the healing art for the benefit of those\r\nwhose constitutions were naturally sound; he expelled their disorders\r\nby drugs and the use of the knife, without interfering with their\r\nusual avocations; but when he found they were hopelessly incurable,\r\nhe would not attempt to prolong a miserable life by rules and diet,\r\nas such persons would be of no use either to themselves or the state.\r\nConstitutionally diseased persons and the intemperate livers were to\r\nbe left to be dealt with by Nature, so that they might die of their\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPOST-HIPPOCRATIC GREEK MEDICINE.—THE SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n The Dogmatic School.—Praxagoras of Cos.—Aristotle.—The School\r\n of Alexandria.—Theophrastus the Botanist.—The great Anatomists,\r\n Erasistratus and Hierophilus, and the Schools they founded.—The\r\n Empiric School.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOGMATIC SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nIt was only natural that the philosophical Greeks should discuss\r\nmedicine at as great a length as they discussed philosophy;\r\naccordingly, we find that no sooner had our art taken its place\r\namongst the subjects worthy of being seriously considered by the Greek\r\nintellect, than it was as much talked about as practised, and wrangled\r\nover as though it were a system of religion. Sects arose which opposed\r\neach other with the greatest vehemence; and Hippocrates had not long\r\nformulated his teaching when his disciples elevated his principles\r\ninto a dogmatism which challenged, and shortly provoked, opposition\r\nof various kinds. Then arose the schools of medicine which ultimately\r\nbecame famous, as those of the DOGMATISTS, EMPIRICS, METHODISTS,\r\nPNEUMATISTS, etc. The DOGMATISTS boasted of being the Rational and\r\nLogical school. They held that there is a certain connection between\r\nall the arts and sciences, and that it is the duty of the physician to\r\navail himself of all sorts of knowledge on every subject which bears\r\nany relationship to his own. They made, therefore, the most careful\r\ninquiry into the remote and proximate causes of disease. They examined\r\nthe influence on the human body of airs, waters, places, occupations,\r\ndiet, seasons, etc. They formulated general rules, not of universal\r\napplication, but modified their treatment according to circumstances,\r\navailing themselves of whatever aid they could obtain from any source.\r\nHippocrates had said, “The physician who is also a philosopher is equal\r\nto the gods,” and the Dogmatists elevated this into an article of their\r\ncreed. Hippocrates, Galen, Oribasius, Ætius, Paulus Ægineta, and the\r\nArab physicians were dogmatists. The founders of the school were the\r\nsons of Hippocrates—Thessalus and Draco. The former was the eldest son\r\nof the great physician, and was the more famous of the two. He passed\r\na great part of his life as physician in the court of Archelaus, king\r\nof Macedonia.[399] His brother, Draco, was physician to Queen Roxana,\r\nwife of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\nWe may say, therefore, that the oldest, most famous, and worthy of the\r\nancient medical sects arose about 400 B.C., and retained its power\r\nover the medical profession till the rise of the Empirical sect in\r\nthe Alexandrian school of philosophy. We are indebted to Celsus for a\r\nlucid and admirable exposition of the doctrines professed by these two\r\nmedical parties.[400]\r\n\r\nThe Dogmatists maintained that it was not enough for the physician to\r\nknow the mere symptoms of his patient’s malady. It does not suffice to\r\nknow the _evident causes_ of the disorder, but he must acquaint himself\r\nwith the _hidden causes_. To acquire this knowledge of the _hidden\r\ncauses_, he must study the _hidden parts_, and the natural actions and\r\nfunctions of the body in health. He must know the principles on which\r\nthe human machinery is constructed before he can scientifically treat\r\nthe accidents and disturbances to which it is liable. It was not,\r\ntherefore, a mere subject of philosophical interest to hold with some\r\nphysicians that diseases proceed from excess or deficiency of one or\r\nother of the four elements, or with others, that the various humours or\r\nthe respiration were at fault. It was not of merely academic interest\r\nto suppose that the abnormal flow of the blood caused inflammations,\r\nor that corpuscles blocked up the invisible passages. The doctor must\r\ndo more than speculate on these things in his discussions. He must\r\nhave a theory upon them which he could apply to the treatment of his\r\npatients, and the best physician would be the one who best knew how\r\nthe disease originated. Experiments without reasoning were valueless;\r\ntheir chief use was to inform the experimenter whether he had reasoned\r\njustly or conjectured fortunately. When the physician is confronted by\r\na new form of disease for which no remedy has been discovered, he must\r\nknow its cause and origin, or his practice will be mere guess-work.\r\nAnybody can discover the evident causes—heat, cold, over-eating.\r\nThese things the least instructed physician will probably know. It is\r\nthe knowledge of hidden causes which makes the superior man. He who\r\naspires to be instructed must know what we now call physiology—why we\r\nbreathe, why we eat, what happens to the food which we swallow, why the\r\narteries pulsate, why we sleep, etc. The man who cannot explain these\r\nphenomena is not a competent doctor. He must have frequently inspected\r\ndead bodies, and examined carefully their internal parts; but they\r\nmaintained that it was much the better way to open living persons, as\r\nHerophilus and Erasistratus did, so that they could acquaint themselves\r\nin life with the structures whose disturbance or disease causes the\r\nsufferings which they were called upon to alleviate. What is known as\r\nthe “Humoral Pathology” formed the most essential part of the system of\r\nthe Dogmatists.\r\n\r\nHumoral pathology explains all diseases as caused by the mixture of\r\nthe four cardinal humours; viz., the blood, bile, mucus or phlegm,\r\nand water. Hippocrates leaned towards it, but it was Plato who\r\ndeveloped it. The stomach is the common source of all these humours.\r\nWhen diseases develop, they attract these humours. The source of the\r\nbile is the liver; of the mucus, the head; of the water, the spleen.\r\nBile causes all acute diseases, mucus in the head causes catarrhs and\r\nrheumatism, dropsy depends on the spleen.\r\n\r\nDIOCLES CARYSTIUS, a famous Greek physician, said by Pliny[401] to have\r\nbeen next in age and fame to Hippocrates himself, lived in the fourth\r\ncentury B.C. He wrote several treatises on medicine, of which the\r\ntitles and some fragments are preserved by Galen, Cælius Aurelianus,\r\nOribasius, and others. His letter to King Antigonus, entitled “An\r\nEpistle on Preserving Health,” is inserted at the end of the first book\r\nof Paulus Ægineta, and was probably addressed to Antigonus Gonatus,\r\nking of Macedonia, who died B.C. 239. This treatise is so valuable a\r\nsummary of the medical teaching of the time that it will be useful\r\nto insert it in this place. “Since of all kings you are the most\r\nskilled in the arts, and have lived very long, and are skilled in\r\nall philosophy, and have attained the highest rank in mathematics,\r\nI, supposing that the science which treats of all things that relate\r\nto health is a branch of philosophy becoming a king and befitting to\r\nyou, have written you this account of the origin of diseases, of the\r\nsymptoms which precede them, and of the modes by which they may be\r\nalleviated. For neither does a storm gather in the heavens but it is\r\npreceded by certain signs which seamen and men of much skill attend\r\nto, nor does any disease attack the human frame without having some\r\nprecursory symptom. If, then, you will only be persuaded by what we\r\nsay regarding them, you may attain a correct acquaintance with these\r\nthings. We divide the human body into four parts: the head, the chest,\r\nthe belly, and the bladder. When a disease is about to fix in the\r\nhead, it is usually announced beforehand by vertigo, pain in the head,\r\nheaviness in the eyebrows, noise in the ears, and throbbing of the\r\ntemples; the eyes water in the morning, attended with dimness of sight;\r\nthe sense of smell is lost, and the gums become swelled. When any such\r\nsymptoms occur, the head ought to be purged, not indeed with any strong\r\nmedicine, but, taking the tops of hyssop and sweet marjoram, pound them\r\nand boil them in a pot, with half a hemina of must or rob; rinse the\r\nmouth with this in the morning before eating, and evacuate the humours\r\nby gargling. There is no gentler remedy than this for affections of\r\nthe head. Mustard in warm, honied water also answers the purpose very\r\nwell. Take a mouthful of this in the morning before eating, gargle and\r\nevacuate the humours. The head also should be warmed by covering it\r\nin such a manner as that the phlegm may be readily discharged. Those\r\nwho neglect these symptoms are apt to be seized with the following\r\ndisorders: inflammations of the eyes, cataracts, pain of the ears as\r\nif from a fracture, strumous affections of the neck, sphacelus of\r\nthe brain, catarrh, quinsy, running ulcers called achores, caries,\r\nenlargement of the uvula, defluxion of the hairs, ulceration of the\r\nhead, pain in the teeth. When some disease is about to fall upon the\r\nchest, it is usually announced by some of the following symptoms: There\r\nare profuse sweats over the whole body, and particularly about the\r\nchest, the tongue is rough, expectoration saltish, bitter, or bilious,\r\npains suddenly seizing the sides or shoulder-blades, frequent yawning,\r\nwatchfulness, oppressed respiration, thirst after sleep, despondency of\r\nmind, coldness of the breast and arms, trembling of the hands. These\r\nsymptoms may be relieved in the following manner: Procure vomiting\r\nafter a moderate meal without medicine. Vomiting also when the stomach\r\nis empty will answer well; to produce which first swallow some small\r\nradishes, cresses, rocket, mustard and purslain, and then by drinking\r\nwarm water procure vomiting. Upon those who neglect these symptoms\r\nthe following diseases are apt to supervene: pleurisy, peripneumony,\r\nmelancholy, acute fevers, frenzy, lethargy, ardent fever attended with\r\nhiccough. When any disease is about to attack the bowels, some of the\r\nfollowing symptoms announce its approach: In the first place, the belly\r\nis griped and disordered, the food and drink seem bitter, heaviness\r\nof the knees, inability to bend the loins, pains over the whole body\r\nunexpectedly occurring, numbness of the legs, slight fever. When any\r\nof these occur, it will be proper to loosen the belly by a suitable\r\ndiet without medicine. There are many articles of this description\r\nwhich one may use with safety, such as beets boiled in honeyed water,\r\nboiled garlic, mallows, dock, the herb mercury, honied cakes; for all\r\nthese things are laxative of the bowels. Or, if any of these symptoms\r\nincrease, mix bastard saffron with all these decoctions, for thereby\r\nthey will be rendered sweeter and less dangerous. The smooth cabbage\r\nboiled in a large quantity of water is also beneficial. This decoction,\r\nwith honey and salt, may be drunk to the amount of about four heminæ,\r\nor the water of chick-peas and tares boiled may be drunk in the same\r\nmanner. Those who neglect the afore-mentioned symptoms are apt to be\r\nseized with the following affections: diarrhœa, dysentery, lientery,\r\nileus, ischiatic disease, tertian fever, gout, apoplexy, hæmorrhoids,\r\nrheumatism. When any disease is about to seize the bladder, the\r\nfollowing symptoms are its usual precursors: A sense of repletion after\r\ntaking even a small quantity of food, flatulence, eructation, paleness\r\nof the whole body, deep sleep, urine pale and passed with difficulty,\r\nswellings about the privy parts. When any of these symptoms appear,\r\ntheir safest cure will be by aromatic diuretics. Thus, the roots of\r\nfennel and parsley may be infused in white fragrant wine, and drunk\r\nevery day when the stomach is empty in the morning, to the amount of\r\ntwo cyathi, with water in which carrot, myrtle, or elecampane has been\r\nmacerated (you may use any of these you please, for all are useful);\r\nand the infusion of chick-peas in water in like manner. On those who\r\nneglect these symptoms the following diseases are apt to supervene:\r\ndropsy, enlargement of the spleen, pain of the liver, calculus,\r\ninflammation of the kidney, strangury, distension of the belly.\r\nRegarding all these symptoms, it may be remarked that children ought to\r\nbe treated with gentler remedies, and adults with more active. I have\r\nnow to give you an account of the seasons of the year in which each of\r\nthese complaints occur, and what things ought to be taken and avoided.\r\nI begin with the winter solstice. _Of the winter solstice_: This season\r\ndisposes men to catarrhs and defluxions until the vernal equinox. It\r\nwill be proper then to take such things as are of a heating nature,\r\ndrink wine little diluted, or drink pure wine, or of the decoction of\r\nmarjoram. From the winter solstice to the vernal equinox are ninety\r\ndays. _Of the vernal equinox_: This season increases phlegm in men, and\r\nthe sweetish humours in the blood, until the rising of the pleiades.\r\nUse therefore juicy and acrid things, take labour, ... To the rising\r\nof the pleiades are forty-six days. _Of the rising of the pleiades_:\r\nThis season increases the bitter bile and bitter humours in men, until\r\nthe summer solstice. Use therefore all sweet things, laxatives of the\r\nbelly.... To the summer solstice are forty-five days. _Of the summer\r\nsolstice_: This season increases the formation of black bile in men,\r\nuntil the autumnal equinox. Use therefore cold water, and everything\r\nthat is fragrant.... To the autumnal equinox are ninety-three days. _Of\r\nthe autumnal equinox_: This season increases phlegm and thin rheums\r\nin men until the setting of the pleiades. Use therefore remedies for\r\nremoving rheums, have recourse to acrid and succulent things, take no\r\nvomits, and abstain from labour.... To the setting of the pleiades\r\nare forty-five days. _Of the setting of the pleiades_: This season\r\nincreases phlegm in men until the winter solstice. Take therefore all\r\nsour things, drink as much as is agreeable of a weak wine, use fat\r\nthings, and labour strenuously. To the winter solstice are forty-five\r\ndays.”[402]\r\n\r\nPRAXAGORAS of Cos, who lived in the fourth century B.C., shortly after\r\nDiocles, was a famous physician of the Dogmatic sect, who especially\r\nexcelled in anatomy and physiology. He placed the seat of all diseases\r\nin the humours of the body, and was one of the chief supporters of\r\nwhat is known as the “humoral pathology.” Sprengel[403] and others\r\nstate that he was the first who pointed out the distinction between\r\nthe arteries and the veins; but M. Littré denies this, and seems to\r\nprove that the differences were known to Aristotle, Hippocrates, and\r\nother writers.[404] His knowledge of anatomy must have been very\r\nconsiderable, and his surgery was certainly bold; so that he even\r\nventured, in cases of intussusception of the bowel, to open the\r\nabdomen in order to replace the intestine. In hernia he practised the\r\ntaxis,[405] _i.e._ replaced the bowel by the hand; and he amputated the\r\nuvula in affections of that organ. He had many pupils, amongst others\r\nHerophilus, Philotimus, and Plistonicus.\r\n\r\nARISTOTLE, the founder of comparative anatomy and the father of the\r\nscience of natural history, was the son of Nichomachus, physician to\r\nAmyntas II., king of Macedonia. He was born at Stageira, B.C. 334.\r\nHis father was a scientific man of the race of the Asclepiads, and it\r\nwas the taste for such pursuits and the inherited bent of mind which\r\nearly inclined the son to the investigation of nature. He went to\r\nAthens, where he became the disciple of Plato, and remained in his\r\nsociety for twenty years. In his forty-second year he was summoned by\r\nPhilip of Macedon to undertake the tuition of Alexander the Great,\r\nwho was then fifteen years old. Of his philosophical works it is not\r\nhere necessary to speak; it is his scientific labours, which had so\r\nimportant an influence on medical education, which chiefly concern\r\nus. He wrote _Researches about Animals_, _On Sleep and Waking_, _On\r\nLongevity and Shortlivedness_, _On Respiration_, _On Parts of Animals_,\r\n_On Locomotion of Animals_, _On Generation of Animals_. Aristotle\r\ninspired Alexander with a passion for the study of natural history,\r\nand his royal pupil gave him abundant means and opportunity to collect\r\nmaterials for a history of animals. The science of comparative anatomy,\r\nso important in relation to that of medicine, was thus established. He\r\npointed out the differences which exist between the structure of men\r\nand monkeys; described the organs of the elephant, and the stomach of\r\nthe ruminant animals. The anatomy of birds and the development of their\r\neggs during incubation were accurately described by him; he dissected\r\nreptiles, and studied the habits of fishes. He investigated the action\r\nof the muscles, regarded the heart as the origin of the blood-vessels,\r\nnamed the _aorta_ and the _ventricles_, described the nerves which\r\nhe thought originated in the heart, but he confused the nerves with\r\nthe ligaments and tendons. The heart he considered as the centre of\r\nmovement and feeling[406] and nourishment, holding that it contains the\r\nnatural fire, and is the birthplace of the passions and the seat of the\r\nsoul; the brain he thought was merely a mass of water and earth, and\r\ndid not recognise it as nervous matter. The diaphragm he considered\r\nhad no other office than to separate the abdomen from the thorax and\r\nprotect the seat of the soul (the heart) from the impure influences\r\nof the digestive organs. Superfœtation (or the conception of a second\r\nembryo during the gestation of the first) he held to be possible, and\r\nhe first pointed out the _punctum saliens_.\r\n\r\nTHEOPHRASTUS, whose real name was Tyrtamus, was born at Eresa in the\r\nisland of Lesbos, 371 B.C., fourteen years after Aristotle. He was\r\nthe originator of the science of plants; he first learned the details\r\nof their structure, the uses of their organs, the laws of their\r\nreproduction,—in a word, the physiology of the vegetable world. When\r\nAristotle retired to Chalcis, he chose Theophrastus, to whom he gave\r\nthat name, signifying “a man of divine speech,” as his successor at\r\nthe Lyceum. This distinguished philosopher devoted himself alike to\r\nthe exact and speculative sciences. The greater part of his works\r\nhave perished; what is preserved to us consists of treatises on the\r\nhistory of the vegetable kingdom, of stones, and some fragments of\r\nworks on physics, medicine, and some moral works. His _History of\r\nPlants_ enumerates about five hundred different kinds, many of which\r\nare now difficult to identify. He made some attempts at a vague kind\r\nof classification, and has chapters on aquatic, kitchen, parasite,\r\nsucculent, oleaginous, and cereal plants. He carefully explains the\r\nprinciples of the reproduction of vegetables, and the fecundation\r\nof the female flowers by the pollen of the male. He recognises\r\nhermaphrodite and unisexual flowers, and points out how the fecundation\r\nof the latter is effected by the wind, insects, and by the water in the\r\ncase of aquatic plants. He knew that double flowers were sterile. He\r\ndevotes a chapter to the diseases of the vegetable kingdom; he almost\r\nrecognised the characteristics which distinguish the monocotyledonous\r\nfrom the dicotyledonous plants. In a word, he laid the foundations on\r\nwhich our modern botanists have erected their science.[407]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL OF ALEXANDRIA.\r\n\r\n“In the year 331 B.C.,” says Kingsley,[408] “one of the greatest\r\nintellects whose influence the world has ever felt, saw, with his\r\neagle glance, the unrivalled advantages of the spot which is now\r\nAlexandria; and conceived the mighty project of making it the point\r\nof union of two, or rather of three worlds. In a new city, named\r\nafter himself, Europe, Asia, and Africa were to meet and to hold\r\ncommunion.” When Greece lost her intellectual supremacy with her\r\nnational independence, the centre of literature, philosophy, and\r\nscience was shifted to this unique position. With all the treasures of\r\nEgyptian wisdom around her, with all the stores of Eastern thought on\r\nthe one hand and those of Europe on the other, Alexandria became in\r\nher schools the rallying-point of the world’s thought and activity. If\r\nwe turn to an atlas of ancient geography, we shall be struck with the\r\nunrivalled facilities possessed by this city for gathering to itself\r\nthe treasures, intellectual and material, of the conquered world of\r\nAlexander the Great. From the Danube, Greece, Phœnicia, Palestine,\r\nPersia, Asia Minor, India, Italy, and the Celtic tribes, there came\r\nembassies to Egypt to seek the protection and alliance of Alexander of\r\nMacedon, and each must have contributed something to the greatness of\r\nthe city which he had founded. Just as every traveller in after years\r\nwho passed through the place was compelled to leave a copy of any work\r\nwhich he had brought with him, to the Alexandrian library, so from the\r\nfirst foundation of the town was every visitor a donor of some idea to\r\nits stores of thought.\r\n\r\nAt the dismemberment of Alexander’s vast empire, after his death,\r\nthe Egyptian portion fell to the share of Ptolemy Soter. It was this\r\nsovereign who founded the famous Alexandrian Library; a great patron of\r\nthe arts and sciences, he placed this institution under the direction\r\nof Aristotle. He also established the Schools of Alexandria, and\r\nencouraged the dissection of the human body.\r\n\r\nCHRYSIPPUS, the Cnidian, who lived in the fourth century _B.C._, was\r\nthe father of the Chrysippus who was physician to Ptolemy Soter, and\r\nhe was tutor to Erasistratus. Pliny says that he reversed the practice\r\nof preceding physicians in the most extraordinary manner. He would not\r\npermit bleeding, because the blood contains the soul; did not practise\r\npurging, though he sometimes permitted the use of enemata and emetics.\r\nHe wrote on herbs and their uses, and drove the blood out of limbs\r\nprevious to their amputation on the principles recently re-introduced\r\nby Esmarch. He introduced the use of vapour baths in the treatment of\r\ndropsy. As there were several physicians of the name of Chrysippus,\r\nand as their works are lost, it is very difficult to distinguish their\r\nmaxims. Amongst the disciples of the Cnidian physician of this name\r\nwere MEDIUS, ARISTOGENES, METRODORUS, and ERASISTRATUS, as we have said.\r\n\r\nHEROPHILUS, of Chalcedon in Bithynia, a pupil of CHRYSIPPUS of Cnidos\r\nand PRAXAGORAS of Cos, was one of the most famous physicians of the\r\nancient world. He was a great anatomist and physiologist, and a\r\ncontemporary of the philosopher Diodorus Cronos, and of Ptolemy Soter\r\nin the fourth and third centuries B.C. He settled at Alexandria, which\r\nunder Ptolemy I. became the most famous centre of the science of the\r\nancient Greeks. Here Herophilus founded with other physicians of the\r\ncity the great medical school which ultimately became distinguished\r\nabove all others, so that a sufficient guarantee of a physician’s\r\nability was the fact that he had received his education at Alexandria.\r\nThe foundation of the Alexandrian School formed a great epoch in\r\nthe history of medicine. The dissection of the human body was of\r\nthe utmost importance to the healing art. While the practice was\r\nforbidden, it could only have been performed furtively and in a\r\nhasty and unsatisfactory manner. The science of anatomy, on which\r\nthat of medicine to be anything but quackery must be founded, now\r\ntook its proper place in the education of the doctor. The bodies of\r\nall malefactors were given over for the purposes of dissection.[409]\r\nHerophilus is accused of having also dissected alive as many as\r\nsix hundred criminals. This fact has been denied by some of his\r\nbiographers, and others have attempted to explain it away; but it is\r\ncharged against him by Tertullian,[410] and Celsus mentions it[411] as\r\nthough it were a well-known fact, and without the least suspicion that\r\nit was an unjust accusation.\r\n\r\nAsked who is the best doctor, he is said to have replied, “He who knows\r\nhow to distinguish the possible from the impossible.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of his anatomical researches he made many discoveries\r\nand gave to parts of the human body names which remain in common use\r\nto this day. Dr. Baas thus sums up his anatomical and physiological\r\nknowledge. He knew the nerves, that they had a capacity for sensation,\r\nand were subject to the will, were derived from the brain, in which he\r\ndiscovered the calamus scriptorius, the tela choroidea, the venous\r\nsinuses, and torcular Herophili. He believed the fourth ventricle to\r\nbe the seat of the soul. He discovered the chyliferous and lactiferous\r\nvessels. He described accurately the liver and Fallopian tubes, the\r\nepididymis and the duodenum, to which he gave its name, and also the\r\nos hyoides, the uvea, the vitreous humour, the retina, and the ciliary\r\nprocesses. He called the pulmonary artery the vena arteriosa, and the\r\npulmonary vein the arteria venosa. He distinguished in respiration a\r\nsystole, a diastole, and a period of rest. He founded the doctrine of\r\nthe pulse, its rhythm, the bounding pulse and its varieties according\r\nto age. The pulse is communicated by the heart to the walls of the\r\narteries. He distinguished between arteries and veins, and admitted\r\nthat the arteries contain blood. He taught that diseases are caused\r\nby a corruption of the humours. Paralysis is due to a lack of nerve\r\ninfluence. He laid great stress upon diet, bled frequently, and\r\npractised ligation of the limbs to arrest bleeding. He was the first to\r\nadminister cooking salt as a medicine. A good botanist, he preferred\r\nvegetable remedies, which he termed the “Hands of the gods.” He\r\npossessed considerable acquaintance with obstetric operations,[412] and\r\nwrote a text-book of midwifery.[413]\r\n\r\nERASISTRATUS, of Iulis in the island of Cos, a pupil of CHRYSIPPUS was\r\none of the most famous physicians and anatomists of the Alexandrian\r\nschool. Plutarch says that when he was physician to King Seleucus,\r\nhe discovered that the young prince Antiochus had fallen in love\r\nwith his step-mother Stratonice by finding no physical cause for the\r\nillness from which he was suffering, and that his heart palpitated,\r\nhe trembled, blushed, and perspired when the lady entered the room.\r\nBy adroit management he induced the king to confer on the prince the\r\nobject of the young man’s passion. _Similia similibus curantur._ So\r\nsuccessful was the treatment that the physician received a fee of 100\r\ntalents, which supposing the Attic standard to be meant would amount to\r\n£24,375, perhaps the largest medical fee on record.[414] He lived for\r\nsome time in Alexandria, and gave up medical practice in his old age,\r\nthat he might devote his whole time to the study of anatomy.\r\n\r\nDr. Baas, in his account of the Anatomy, Physiology, and Medicine of\r\nErasistratus, says that he divided the nerves into those of sensation\r\nand those of motion. The brain substance is the origin of the motor and\r\nthe brain membranes that of the sensory nerves.[415] Like Herophilus,\r\nhe confounded the nerves and ligaments. He described accurately the\r\nstructure, convolutions, and ventricles of the brain. He thought that\r\nthe convolutions, especially those of the cerebellum, are the seat of\r\nthought, and located mental diseases in the brain. He knew the lymph\r\nand chyle vessels, and the chordæ tendineæ of the heart. He assumed\r\nthe anastomoses of the arteries and veins. The pneuma in the heart is\r\nvital spirits, in the brain is animal spirits. Digestion is due to\r\nthe friction of the walls of the stomach. He thought that the bile is\r\nuseless, as is the spleen and other viscera. He shows some acquaintance\r\nwith pathological anatomy, as he describes induration of the liver in\r\ndropsy. His idea of the cause of disease is plethora and aberration of\r\nthe humours. Inflammation is due to the detention of the blood in the\r\nsmall vessels by the pneuma driven from the heart into the arteries;\r\nfever occurs when the pneuma is crowded back to the heart by the venous\r\nblood, and blood gets into the large arteries. Dropsy always proceeds\r\nfrom the liver. He discarded bleeding and purgation; recommended\r\nbaths, enemeta, emetics, friction, and cupping. He was, thinks Dr.\r\nBaas, a forerunner of Hahnemann in the doctrine of small doses, as\r\nhe prescribed three drops of wine in bilious diarrhœa. He opened the\r\nabdomen to apply remedies directly to the affected part, and invented a\r\nkind of catheter.[416]\r\n\r\nErasistratus was the first to describe a species of hunger, to which\r\nhe gave the name Boulimia—a desire for food which cannot be satisfied.\r\nIn his account of the complaint he mentions the Scythians, who, when\r\nobliged to fast, tie bandages round their abdomens tightly, and this\r\nstays their hunger.[417]\r\n\r\nThe ancient apologists for the human vivisections of Herophilus and\r\nErasistratus used to say that these anatomists were thus “enabled to\r\nbehold, during life, those parts which nature had concealed, and to\r\ncontemplate their situation, colour, figure, size, order, hardness\r\nor softness, roughness or smoothness, etc. They added that it is not\r\npossible, when a person has any internal illness, to know what is the\r\ncause of it, unless one is exactly acquainted with the situation of\r\nall the viscera; nor can one heal any part without understanding its\r\nnature: that when the intestines protrude through a wound, a person\r\nwho does not know what is their colour when in a healthy state cannot\r\ndistinguish the sound from the diseased parts, nor therefore apply\r\nproper remedies; while, on the contrary, he who is acquainted with\r\nthe natural state of the diseased parts will undertake the cure with\r\nconfidence and certainty; and that, in short, it is not to be called an\r\nact of cruelty, as some persons suppose it, to seek for the remedies\r\nof an immense number of _innocent_ persons in the sufferings of a few\r\n_criminals_.”[418]\r\n\r\nAMMONIUS OF ALEXANDRIA, surnamed LITHOTOMUS, probably lived in the\r\nreign of Ptolemy Philadelphus (B.C. 283-247). He is celebrated as\r\nhaving been the first surgeon who thought of crushing a stone within\r\nthe bladder when too large for extraction entire; for this reason he\r\nwas called λιθοτόμος. Celsus describes his method.[419]\r\n\r\nOf the Herophilists we may mention DEMETRIUS OF APAMÆA (B.C. 276), who\r\nnamed and described diabetes, and was distinguished as an obstetrician.\r\n\r\nMANTIAS, who, B.C. 250, first collected the preparations of medicines\r\ninto a special book.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES PHILALETHES, who, under Nero, was the most celebrated\r\noculist of his time, wrote a work on diseases of the eye, which was the\r\nstandard authority until about A.D. 1000. The work has perished, but\r\nÆtius and Paulus Ægineta have preserved some fragments of it. He wrote\r\nalso on the pulse.\r\n\r\nHEGETON was a surgeon of Alexandria who was mentioned by Galen as\r\nhaving lived there as a contemporary of several physicians who were\r\nknown to have resided in that city at the end of the second or the\r\nbeginning of the first century B.C. He was a follower of Herophilus,\r\nand wrote a book on the causes of diseases entitled Περὶ Αἰτιῶν, which\r\nhas perished.\r\n\r\nOf the school of Erasistratus we may mention XENOPHON OF COS, who\r\nwrote a work on the names of the parts of the human body, and on\r\nbotany and the diseases of women. NICIAS OF MILETUS, a friend of the\r\npoet Theocritus; PHILOXENOS, who, according to Celsus, wrote several\r\nvaluable books on surgery; and MARTIALIS the Anatomist, who visited\r\nRome about A.D. 165. He knew Galen, and wrote works on anatomy which\r\nwere in great repute long after his death.\r\n\r\nThe followers of Herophilus and Erasistratus, though they founded\r\nschools, did not greatly influence the art of medicine, nor did they\r\ncontribute much to its advancement beyond the point in which it was\r\nleft by their great masters. They fell into fruitless speculations\r\ninstead of pursuing their science by accumulating facts; in the words\r\nof Pliny, it was easier “to sit and listen quietly in the schools,\r\nthan to be up and wandering over deserts, and to seek out new plants\r\nevery day.”[420] So Dogmatism fell into disrepute and made way for the\r\nadvent of Empiricism.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF THE EMPIRICS.\r\n\r\nThe School of the Empirics was the outcome of the system of Scepticism,\r\nintroduced by Pyrrho and extended by Carneades, who taught that there\r\nis no certainty about anything, no true knowledge of phenomena, and\r\nthat probability alone can be our guide. Ænesidemus carried this\r\nscepticism into the medicine of the Empirics, but the school was\r\noriginally established under the title of the Teretics or Mnemoneutics.\r\nThe Empirics rested their system on what was called the “Empiric\r\ntripod,”—that is, accident, history, and analogy. Remedies have come\r\nto us by chance, by the remembrance of previous cures, and by applying\r\nthem to similar cases.\r\n\r\nThe sect of the EMPIRICISTS was founded by Serapion of Alexandria and\r\nPhilinus of Cos in the third century B.C. They were in opposition\r\nto the Dogmatists, professing to derive their knowledge only from\r\nexperience; they held that the whole art of medicine consisted in\r\nobservation, experiment, and the application of known remedies which\r\nhave constantly proved valuable in the treatment of one class of\r\ndiseases to other and presumably similar classes. Celsus,[421] in\r\nhis account of the principles of this sect, says that “they admit\r\nthat the evident causes are necessary, but deprecate inquiry into\r\nthem because nature is incomprehensible. This is proved because the\r\nphilosophers and physicians who have spent so much labour in trying\r\nto search out these occult causes cannot agree amongst themselves. If\r\nreasoning could make physicians, the philosophers should be the most\r\nsuccessful practitioners, as they have such abundance of words. If\r\nthe causes of diseases were the same in all places, the same remedies\r\nought to be used everywhere. Relief from sickness is to be sought\r\nfrom things certain and tried, that is from experience, which guides\r\nus in all other arts. Husbandmen and pilots do not reason about their\r\nbusiness, but they practise it. Disquisitions can have no connection\r\nwith medicine, because physicians whose opinions have been directly\r\nopposed to one another have equally restored their patients to health;\r\nthey did not derive their methods of cure from studying the occult\r\ncauses about which they disputed, but from the experience they had of\r\nthe remedies which they employed upon their patients. Medicine was not\r\nfirst discovered in consequence of reasoning, but the theory was sought\r\nfor after the discovery of medicine. Does reason, they ask, prescribe\r\nthe same as experience, or something different? If the same, it must be\r\nneedless; if different, it must be mischievous.\r\n\r\n“But what remains is also cruel, to cut open the abdomen and præcordia\r\nof living men, and make that art, which presides over the health of\r\nmankind, the instrument, not only of inflicting death, but of doing\r\nit in the most horrid manner; especially if it be considered that\r\nsome of those things which are sought after with so much barbarity\r\ncannot be known at all, and others may be known without any cruelty:\r\nfor that the colour, smoothness, softness, hardness, and such like,\r\nare not the same in a wounded body as they were in a sound one; and\r\nfurther, because these qualities, even in bodies that have suffered\r\nno external violence, are often changed by fear, grief, hunger,\r\nindigestion, fatigue, and a thousand other inconsiderable disorders,\r\nwhich makes it much more probable that the internal parts, which are\r\nfar more tender, and never exposed to the light itself, are changed\r\nby the severest wounds and mangling. And that nothing can be more\r\nridiculous than to imagine anything to be the same in a dying man, nay,\r\none already dead, as it is in a living person; for that the abdomen\r\nmay indeed be opened while a man breathes, but as soon as the knife\r\nhas reached the præcordia, and the transverse septum is cut, which\r\nby a kind of membrane divides the upper from the lower parts (and by\r\nthe Greeks is called the diaphragm), the man immediately expires; and\r\nthen the præcordia, and all the viscera, never come to the view of the\r\nbutchering physician till the man is dead; and they must necessarily\r\nappear as such of a dead person, and not as they were while he lived;\r\nand thus the physician gains only the opportunity of murdering a man\r\ncruelly, and not of observing what are the appearances of the viscera\r\nin a living person. If, however, there can be anything which can be\r\nobserved in a person which yet breathes, chance often throws it in the\r\nway of such as practise the healing art; for that sometimes a gladiator\r\non the stage, a soldier in the field, or a traveller beset by robbers,\r\nis so wounded that some internal part, different in different people,\r\nmay be exposed to view; and thus a prudent physician finds their\r\nsituation, position, order, figure, and the other particulars he wants\r\nto know, not by perpetrating murder, but by attempting to give health;\r\nand learns by compassion that which others had discovered by horrid\r\ncruelty. That for these reasons it is not necessary to lacerate even\r\ndead bodies; which, though not cruel, yet may be shocking to the sight;\r\nsince most things are different in dead bodies; and even the dressing\r\nof wounds shows all that can be discovered in the living” (Futvoye’s\r\nTranslation).[422]\r\n\r\nPHILINUS OF COS, the reputed founder of the school, was a pupil of\r\nHerophilus, and lived in the third century B.C. He declared that all\r\nthe anatomy his vivisecting master had taught him had not helped him\r\nin the least in the cure of his patients. He has been compared with\r\nHahnemann.\r\n\r\nSERAPION OF ALEXANDRIA was also of the third century B.C. He must\r\nnot be confounded with the Arabian physician of this name. He wrote\r\nagainst Hippocrates. He discarded all hypotheses. He was the first to\r\nprescribe sulphur in chronic skin diseases; and he used some singular\r\nand disgusting remedies in his treatment. One of these was crocodiles’\r\ndung, which in consequence became scarce and costly. GLAUCIAS, who\r\ninvented the “Empiric Tripod,” ZEUXIS and HERACLIDES of Tarentum, lived\r\nabout this period. The latter wrote commentaries on Hippocrates, and\r\nused opium to procure sleep. He mentions strangulated hernia in one of\r\nhis treatises.\r\n\r\nMany commentaries were written about this time on Hippocrates;\r\nand the art of pharmacy, especially the preparation of poisons,\r\nwas much studied in the second century B.C. Botanic gardens were\r\nestablished, and men began to experiment with antidotes for poisons.\r\n“Mithridaticum,” so called after MITHRIDATES THE GREAT OF PONTUS, was\r\na famous antidote which was used even to recent times. NICANDER OF\r\nCOLOPHON wrote poems on poisons, and antidotes, leeches, and emetics\r\nfor the first time appeared in poetry, and the symptoms of opium and\r\nlead-poisoning were not beneath the attention of the muse. ATTALUS\r\nIII., king of Pergamos, was in constant fear of being poisoned, says\r\nPlutarch,[423] amused himself with planting poisonous herbs, not\r\nonly henbane and hellebore, but hemlock, aconite, and dorycnium. He\r\ncultivated these in the royal gardens, gathered them at the proper\r\nseasons, and studied their properties and the qualities of their juices\r\nand fruits.\r\n\r\nCleopatra is said by Baas[424] to have written a work on the diseases\r\nof parturient and lying-in women, etc. She paid special attention, it\r\nwould seem, to maladies of a specific character.\r\n\r\nLe Clerc gives a list of the women who have exercised the profession of\r\nmedicine in ancient times.[425]\r\n\r\nCLEOPATRA treated the diseases of women. ARTEMISIA, Queen of Caria,\r\nISIS, CYBELE, LATONA, DIANA, PALLAS, ANGITA, MEDEA, CIRCE, POLYDAMNA,\r\nAGAMEDA, HELEN, ŒNONE, HIPPO, OCRYOE, EPIONE, ERIOPIS, HYGEIA, ÆGLE,\r\nPANACEA, JASO, ROME, and ACESO are the ladies of classic story who had\r\nmore or less acquaintance with medicine for good or evil purposes. That\r\nwomen, subject to many disorders for which in any state of society\r\ntheir natural modesty would make it difficult for them to consult men,\r\nshould become proficient in the treatment of complaints which are\r\npeculiar to their sex, is the most natural thing in the world, and it\r\nis probable that very much of our knowledge of the treatment of these\r\ncases may be due to feminine wisdom. An ancient law of the Athenians\r\nforbade women and slaves to exercise the art of medicine, so that\r\neven midwifery, which they considered a branch of it, could only be\r\npractised by men. Some Athenian ladies preferred to die rather than be\r\nattended by men in their confinements. Women acted as accoucheuses in\r\nEgypt, Greece, and Rome, and some of them in classic times wrote books\r\non medicine. Ætius gives some fragments in his works from a doctress\r\nnamed ASPASIA.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Greek physicians did not know anything of the circulation\r\nof the blood as we understand it, they were not wholly ignorant of the\r\nphenomena of the vascular system.\r\n\r\nThe arteries were so called by the ancients because they thought they\r\ncontained air, as they were always found empty after death. Hippocrates\r\nand his contemporaries called the trachea an artery. Some of the\r\nancient anatomists, however, knew that they contain blood, and they\r\nknew that when an artery is divided it is more dangerous and entails\r\na longer recovery than the division of a vein. They knew also of the\r\npulsation in the arteries which does not exist in the veins, and they\r\nwere fully aware of the importance of this fact in its relation to\r\ndiagnosis and treatment.\r\n\r\n“The ancients chiefly regarded the odd days, and called them critical\r\n(κρισίμοι), as if on these a judgment was to be formed concerning the\r\npatient. These days were the third, fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh,\r\nfourteenth, and twenty-first; so that the greatest influence was\r\nattributed to the seventh, next to the fourteenth, and then to the\r\ntwenty-first. And therefore, with regard to the nourishment of the\r\nsick, they waited for the fits of the odd days; then afterwards they\r\ngave food, expecting the approaching fits to be easier; insomuch that\r\nHippocrates, if the fever had ceased on any other day, used to be\r\napprehensive of a relapse.”[426]\r\n\r\nThese critical days were believed by Hippocrates and most of the other\r\nancient physicians to be influenced by the moon.\r\n\r\nGreek medicine was divided into five parts, and to this day these\r\ndivisions are still maintained. They were (1) Physiology and Anatomy\r\nconsidered together; (2) Ætiology, or the doctrine of the causes of\r\ndisease; (3) Pathology; (4) Hygiene, or the art of preserving the\r\nhealth; (5) Semeiology, or the knowledge of the symptoms of disease and\r\ndiagnosis, and Therapeutics, or the art of curing diseases.\r\n\r\nAs to the contending claims of the various Greek schools of medicine,\r\nDr. Adams says,—\r\n\r\n“There is no legitimate mode of cultivating medical knowledge which was\r\nnot followed by some one or other of the three great sects into which\r\nthe profession was divided in ancient times.”[427]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the professional income of Greek physicians, Herodotus\r\nstates[428] that the Æginetans, about 532 B.C., paid Democedes one\r\ntalent a year from the public treasury for his services, _i.e._ about\r\n£344. From the Athenians he afterwards received a sum amounting to\r\nabout £406 per annum. When he removed to Samos, Polycrates paid him a\r\nsalary of two talents, or £487 10_s._ A difficulty arises, however, as\r\nto this statement of Herodotus, and there may have been an error in the\r\nsums mentioned.[429]\r\n\r\nThe procuring of abortion was not in ancient Greece always considered\r\na very great crime, and amongst the Romans it seems to have been\r\nunnoticed originally. It is related by Cicero that he knew of a case in\r\nAsia where a woman was put to death for having procured the abortion\r\nof her own child. Under the emperors, the punishment was exile or\r\ncondemnation to the mines.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCYTHIANS.\r\n\r\nOf medicine as practised amongst the Scythians, little is known.\r\n\r\nHerodotus says[430] that when the king of the Scythians was sick he\r\nsent for three soothsayers, who proceeded to discover by divination the\r\ncause of his majesty’s malady. The prophets generally said that such or\r\nsuch a citizen had sworn falsely by the royal hearth, mentioning the\r\nname of the citizen against whom they brought the charge. The accused,\r\nhaving been arrested, was charged with causing the king’s illness.\r\nWhen he denied it, the king sent for twice as many more prophets; if\r\nthese confirmed the charge, the offender was promptly executed; if\r\nthey failed to do so, the first prophets were put to death. Abaris,\r\nthe Hyperborean priest of Apollo, cured diseases by incantations, and\r\ndelivered the world from a plague, according to Suidas. Anarcharsis,\r\nthe Scythian philosopher, flourished 592 B.C.; if he knew anything\r\nof medicine, as has been said, he was probably acquainted with such\r\nknowledge of the art as was possessed by the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe ancient physicians seemed to have had no idea of the necessity for\r\nobserving any order in their interpretation of diseases; even in the\r\nmiddle ages, says Sprengel,[431] they merely followed the position of\r\nthe parts of the body, “passing from the head to the chest, from the\r\nthorax to the abdomen, and from the belly to the extremities.”\r\n\r\nIn that branch of modern medical science which treats of the\r\nclassification of diseases, and which is termed Nosology, a systematic\r\narrangement is followed, and the prominent symptoms are taken as the\r\nbasis of that classification.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEK MEDICAL LITERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe following is Dr. Greenhill’s probably complete list of the ancient\r\ntreatises on Therapeutics now extant.[432]\r\n\r\nHippocrates: Seven Books (see p. 178 of this work).

It was the practice\r\nof the soldiers to dress each other’s wounds; they carried bandages\r\nwith them for this purpose; but their surgery must have been very\r\nindifferent, for Livy tells us that, after the battle of Sutrium (B.C.\r\n309), more soldiers were lost by dying of their wounds than were killed\r\nby the enemy.\r\n\r\nAs the Etruscans were famous for their knowledge of philosophy and\r\nmedicine, the Romans probably acquired something of these sciences from\r\nthis ancient people; but that they were more apt at learning their\r\nsuperstitions than their arts of healing, we have proof enough. Whether\r\nthe Romans were more indebted to the Etruscans or to the Sabine people\r\nfor their religion is a question which has been discussed. It would\r\nseem that Numa Pompilius, the legendary king of Rome, was of Sabine\r\norigin, and that he possessed some acquaintance with physical science\r\nand philosophy. He dissuaded the Romans from idolatry. Livy’s account\r\nof his experiments, in consequence of which he was struck by lightning,\r\nhas been considered by some writers as evidence that he was acquainted\r\nwith electricity.[433]\r\n\r\nHow intellectually inferior the ancient Romans were in comparison\r\nwith the Greeks, may be learned from the fact that Pliny tells us\r\nthat “The Roman people for more than 600 years were not, indeed,\r\nwithout medical art, but they were without physicians.” Such mental\r\nculture as the Romans possessed was imported from Greece, and until\r\nthe Greeks instructed them in medicine they possessed nothing but a\r\ntheurgic system of treating disease by prayers, charms, prescriptions\r\nfrom the Sibylline books, and the rude surgery and domestic medicine\r\nof the barbarians. Guilty of degrading superstitions unknown to the\r\nGreeks, the list of their gods and goddesses of disease reads like the\r\naccounts of the healing art from some savage nation. Fever and stench\r\nwere worshipped as the goddesses Febris and Mephitis; Fessonia helped\r\nthe weary, says St. Augustine,[434] and “sweet Cloacina” was invoked\r\nwhen the drains were out of order.[435]\r\n\r\nThe itch patients invoked the goddess Scabies and the plague-stricken\r\nthe goddess Angeronia; women sought the aid of Fluonia and Uterina,\r\nand Ossipaga was goddess of the navel and bones of children. There\r\nwere many goddesses of midwifery; Carna presided over the abdominal\r\nviscera, and sacrifices of beans and bacon were offered to her. St.\r\nAugustine pours his satire and contempt on the women’s goddesses in\r\nthe eleventh chapter of the book from which we have quoted. The Romans\r\nwere cosmopolitan in the way of divinities; Isis and Serapis were\r\nimported from Egypt, the Cabiri from the Phœnicians, and the worship of\r\nÆsculapius was commenced by the Romans, B.C. 294.[436]\r\n\r\nCertain facts in the history of the Romans prove that there was a\r\nprofession of medicine in Rome even in very early times. Plutarch,\r\nin his _Life of Cato the Censor_, speaks of a Roman ambassador who\r\nwas sent to the king of Bithynia, and who had his skull trepanned. By\r\nthe Lex Aquilia a doctor who neglected a slave after an operation was\r\nresponsible if he died in consequence, and in the Twelve Tables of Numa\r\nmention is made of dental operations.\r\n\r\nA college of Æsculapius and of Health was established in Rome 154 B.C.\r\nAn inscription has been discovered in the excavations of the Palatine\r\nwhich has preserved the memorial of its foundation.[437] The medical\r\nprofession of ancient Rome was quite free, and such instruction as\r\nits followers considered it necessary to acquire could be obtained\r\nhow and where they chose. There was no uniform system of education;\r\nthe training was private in early times, and was imparted by such\r\nphysicians as cared to take pupils for a certain specified honorarium.\r\nIt was not till later times that the Archiatri in their colleges, which\r\nwere somewhat on the model of the mediæval guilds, took pupils for\r\ninstruction in medicine and surgery. Pure medical schools did not exist\r\namongst the Romans.[438] Pliny complained[439] “that people believed\r\nin any one who gave himself out for a doctor, even if the falsehood\r\ndirectly entailed the greatest danger.” “Unfortunately there is no law\r\nwhich punishes doctors for ignorance, and no one takes revenge on a\r\ndoctor if, through his fault, some one dies. It is permitted him by our\r\ndanger to learn for the future, at our death to make experiments, and,\r\nwithout having to fear punishment, to set at naught the life of a human\r\nbeing.”\r\n\r\nCato hated physicians, partly because they were mostly Greeks, and,\r\npartly because he was himself an outrageous quack, who thought himself\r\nequal to a whole college of physicians. Plutarch tells us[440] that\r\nhe had heard of the answer which Hippocrates gave the king of Persia,\r\nwhen he sent for him and offered him a reward of many talents: “I will\r\nnever make use of my art in favour of barbarians who are enemies of\r\nthe Greeks.” He affected to believe that all Greek physicians took a\r\nsimilar oath, and therefore advised his son to have nothing to do with\r\nthem. But there is no doubt his objection to the faculty arose from the\r\nfact that he had “himself written a little treatise in which he had set\r\ndown his method of cure.” Cato’s guide to domestic medicine was good\r\nenough for the Roman people; what did they want with Greek physicians?\r\nHis system of diet, according to Plutarch, was peculiar for sick\r\npersons; he did not approve of fasting, he permitted his patients to\r\neat ducks, geese, pigeons, hares, etc., because they are a light diet\r\nsuitable for sick people. Plutarch adds, that he was not in his own\r\nhousehold a very successful practitioner, as he lost his wife and son.\r\nPliny[441] tells us all about Cato’s book of recipes, which the Roman\r\nfather of a family consulted when any of his family or domestic animals\r\nwere ill. The family doctor of those days was the father or the master\r\nof the household, and no doubt Cato was a very generous, if not a very\r\nskilful practitioner. Seneca sums up the healing art of the time thus:\r\n“Medicina quondam paucarum fuit scientia herbarum quibus sisteretur\r\nfluens sanguis, vulnera coirent.”[442]\r\n\r\nCato attempted to cure dislocations by magic songs (carmina): “Huat,\r\nhanat, ista, pista sista damniato damnaustra,” or nonsense simply. What\r\nhis success in the treatment of luxations on this principle we are not\r\ninformed. The practice of medicine and surgery before the time of Cæsar\r\nwas not an honourable one in Rome. This may possibly have arisen from\r\nthe fact that the only professors of the art were Greeks, who for the\r\nmost part left their country for their country’s good and went to Rome\r\nmerely to make money, honestly if possible—perhaps—but at all events\r\nto make it. Rome offered greater facilities for doing this than their\r\nnative land, and the process was doubtless very similar to that with\r\nwhich our own colonies and the United States of America have in the\r\npast been only too familiar.[443]\r\n\r\nDuring the severe epidemics which often raged in ancient Rome the\r\noracles were consulted as to the means to be adopted to be rid of\r\nthem; prayers were offered up to the Greek gods of healing as well as\r\nthose of the state. But Greece had done more for the art of healing\r\nby her physicians than her gods could do, and in process of time\r\nthe Romans found this out, and the native doctors were compelled to\r\nyield before the advance of Greek science. The works of the Greek\r\nphysicians and surgeons, who had done so much for medical knowledge and\r\nadvancement, gradually made their way amongst the Romans. These paved\r\nthe way for Hellenic influence, in spite of the disreputable behaviour\r\nof some of the professors of the art of medicine, on whom the Romans\r\nwith good excuse looked as quacks and foreigners whose only object was\r\ngain. We read of the erection at Rome of a temple in honour of Apollo\r\nthe healer, 467 B.C., and of the building of a temple to Æsculapius of\r\nEpidaurus, 460 B.C. Ten years later the Romans built a temple to the\r\ngoddess _Salus_ when the pestilence raged in their city. Lucina was\r\nfirst worshipped there 400 B.C. In 399 B.C. the first _lectisternium_,\r\na festival of Greek origin, was held in Rome by order of the Sybilline\r\nbooks; it was held on exceptional occasions, the present being a time\r\nof fresh public distress on account of a pestilence which was raging.\r\nThe images of the gods were laid on a couch; a table spread with a meal\r\nwas placed before them, and solemn prayers and sacrifices were offered.\r\nA third _lectisternium_ was held at Rome 362 B.C. That he might\r\nobtain a cessation of the pestilence then raging in Rome, L. Manlius\r\nImperiorus fixed a nail in the temple of Jupiter, B.C. 360. This\r\nholding of lectisternes and driving nails in the temple walls became\r\nthe recognised method of dealing with such scourges, and painfully\r\nexhibits the powerlessness of mankind to deal with disease by theurgic\r\nmeans. Science alone can combat disease, the bed and board offered to\r\nthe gods who cannot use them are now bestowed on health officers who\r\ncan; we no longer drive nails in temple walls to remind deities that\r\nwe are in trouble, but we send memorials to our colleges of physicians\r\ndemanding suggestions for escaping a visitation of cholera; it is\r\nnot sufficient to fix “a nail in a sure place,” it must be fixed in\r\nthe right one. In the year 291 B.C., on the occasion of a pestilence\r\nin Rome, ten ambassadors were sent to Epidaurus to seek aid from the\r\ntemple of Æsculapius. The god was sent to the afflicted city under the\r\nfigure of a serpent. He comes to our towns now under the figure of a\r\ncask of carbolic acid.\r\n\r\nARCHAGATHUS was the first person who regularly practised medicine in\r\nRome. He was a Peloponnesian who settled in the city B.C. 219, and\r\nwas welcomed with great respect by the authorities, who purchased a\r\nsurgery or shop for him at the public expense, and gave him the “Jus\r\nQuiritium.”\r\n\r\nAs he treated his patients chiefly with the knife and powerful\r\ncaustics, his severe remedies gave great offence to the people and\r\nbrought the profession of surgery into contempt. He was called a\r\n“butcher,” and had to leave the city.[444]\r\n\r\nALEXANDER SEVERUS (225-235 A.D.) was the first who established public\r\nlecture rooms for teachers of medicine and granted stipends to them.\r\nIn return they were compelled to teach poor state-supported students\r\ngratuitously. Constantine demanded like services from the doctors in\r\nreturn for certain immunities.[445]\r\n\r\nThere was no regular curriculum, nor period of studentship; everything\r\ndepended upon the ability and industry of the individual pupil.\r\nClinical instruction was given by the teachers, as Martial tells in a\r\nsatirical verse:—\r\n\r\n    “Faint was I only, Symmachus, till thou,\r\n    Backed by an hundred students, throng’dst my bed;\r\n    An hundred icy fingers chilled my brow:\r\n    I had no fever; now I’m nearly dead!”\r\n\r\n                                               (Dr. Handerson’s Trans.)\r\n\r\nAnatomy had been pretty thoroughly taught in the Roman Empire. RUFUS\r\nOF EPHESUS, who lived probably in the reign of Trajan, A.D. 98-117,\r\nwas a very famous anatomist. He considered the spleen to be absolutely\r\nuseless: a belief which lasted to quite modern times. The nerves we\r\ncall recurrent were probably then only recently discovered. He proved\r\nthat the nerves proceed from the brain, and divided them into those of\r\nsensation and those of motion. He considered the heart to be the seat\r\nof life, and remarked that the left ventricle is smaller and thicker\r\nthan the right. He discovered the crossing (decussation) of the optic\r\nnerves, and made several important researches in the anatomy of the\r\neye. He wrote on diseases of the mind, and discussed medicines in\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nMARINUS, a celebrated physician and anatomist, lived in the first or\r\nsecond century of our era. He wrote many anatomical treatises, which\r\nGalen greatly praised, and he commented upon Hippocrates. He knew the\r\nseven cranial nerves, and discovered the inferior laryngeal nerve and\r\nthe glands of the intestines.\r\n\r\nQUINTUS, Galen’s tutor, was one of his pupils. LYCUS was a pupil of\r\nQuintus, who wrote anatomical books of some reputation. PELOPS was\r\nalso one of Galen’s earliest tutors, and was a famous anatomist and\r\nphysician at Smyrna. ÆSCHRYON, a native of Pergamos was another of\r\nGalen’s tutors, and had a great knowledge of pharmacy and materia\r\nmedica. He was the father of all those who invent superstitious\r\nremedies for the bite of a mad dog by means of cruelty. For this he\r\ndirects crawfish to be caught at a time when the sun and moon were in\r\na particular position, and to be baked alive. A worthy combination, it\r\nwill be perceived, of superstition, astrology, and purposeless cruelty.\r\n\r\nAlthough anybody might practise medicine in Rome without let or\r\nhindrance, the Lex Cornelia ordered the arrest of the doctor if the\r\npatient died through his negligence (88 B.C.).\r\n\r\nThere was a public sanitary service and other Government employments\r\nwhich demanded properly instructed doctors in ancient Rome, and the\r\npractice of specialism in the treatment of disease was carried to even\r\ngreater lengths than at present. Martial satirises this.[446]\r\n\r\nIn the time of Strabo and in that of Trajan there were public medical\r\nofficers in Gaul, Asia Minor, and in Latium. In Rome there were\r\ndistrict medical officers for every part of the city. They were\r\npermitted to engage in private practice, but were compelled to attend\r\nthe poor gratuitously. Their salary, according to Puschmann,[447] was\r\npaid chiefly in articles of natural produce.\r\n\r\nThe _archiatri populares_ were the district physicians. The court\r\nphysicians were called _archiatri palatini_. The _archiatri\r\nmunicipales_ were municipal physicians. Their guild was the COLLEGIUM\r\nARCHIATRORUM, which in constitution was not unlike our Royal College of\r\nPhysicians.\r\n\r\nDifferent societies employed doctors; the theatres, gladiators, and the\r\ncircus retained surgeons.\r\n\r\nThe art of ophthalmic surgery first became a separate branch of the\r\nmedical profession in the city of Alexandria. Celsus states that\r\nPHILOXENUS, who lived two hundred and seventy years before Christ, was\r\nthe most celebrated of the Alexandrian oculists.[448]\r\n\r\nOculists were a numerous but ignorant class of practitioners in\r\nancient Rome; their treatment was almost always by salves, each\r\neye-doctor having his own specialty. Nearly two hundred seals with\r\nthe proprietors’ names have been discovered which have been attached\r\nto the pots containing the ointments. Galen speaks contemptuously of\r\nthe science of the eye-doctors of his time. Martial satirises them.\r\n“Now you are a gladiator who once were an ophthalmist; you did as a\r\ndoctor what you do as a gladiator.” In another epigram he says, “The\r\nblear-eyed Hylas would have paid you sixpence, O Quintus; one eye is\r\ngone, he will still pay threepence; make haste and take it, brief is\r\nyour chance, when he is blind he will pay you nothing.” Under Nero,\r\nDEMOSTHENES PHILALETHES, the famous doctor of Marseilles, was a\r\ncelebrated oculist, whose work on eye diseases was the chief authority\r\non the subject until about A.D. 1000. Paulus Ægineta, in his treatise\r\non Ophthalmology, recommends crocodile’s dung in opacity of the cornea,\r\nand bed-bugs’ and frogs’ blood in trichiasis; yet with all this\r\nabsurdity he distinguished between cataract and amaurosis.\r\n\r\nThe ophthalmological literature of the Greeks and Romans has for the\r\nmost part perished. Puschmann says that this branch of surgery must\r\nhave been able to show remarkable results. “Not only trichiasis,\r\nhypopyon, leucoma, lachrymal fistula, and other affections of the\r\nexternal parts of the eye were subjected to operative treatment, but\r\neven cataract itself.”[449]\r\n\r\nAlthough the surgeons of the time were ignorant of the true nature of\r\nsome of the diseases which they treated, they could cure them. Cataract\r\nwas treated by “couching,” or depressing the diseased lens by means of\r\na needle, in order to extract it.[450]\r\n\r\nA patient would sometimes require a consultation, when several doctors\r\nwould meet and discuss his case, with much difference of opinion\r\nmore or less violently expressed. Regardless of the sufferings of\r\nthe patient, they wrangled over his symptoms, and behaved as if they\r\nwere engaged in a pugilistic encounter, each man far more anxious to\r\nexhibit his parts and display his dialectical skill than to alleviate\r\nthe sufferings of the unfortunate client. Pliny, Galen, and Theodorus\r\nPriscianus have left realistic descriptions of these medical encounters.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the professional income of the early Roman physicians,\r\nPliny says[451] that Albutius, Arruntius, Calpetanus, Cassius, and\r\nRubrius gained 250,000 sesterces per annum, equal to £1,953 2_s._\r\n6_d._; that Quintus Stertinius made it a favour that he was content to\r\nreceive from the emperor 500,000 sesterces per annum, or £3,906 5_s._,\r\nas he might have made 600,000 sesterces, or £4,687 10_s._, by his\r\nprivate practice. He and his brother, also an Imperial physician, left\r\nbetween them at their death the sum of thirty millions of sesterces, or\r\n£234,375, notwithstanding the large sums they had spent on beautifying\r\nNaples.[452] Galen’s fee for curing the wife of the consul Boethus,\r\nafter a long illness, was about equal to £400 of our money.\r\n\r\nManlius Cornutus, according to Pliny, paid his doctor a sum amounting\r\nto £2,000 for curing him of a skin disease; and the doctors Crinas and\r\nAlcon, according to the same authority, were immensely rich men. But\r\nthese were all exceptional cases, and there is no reason to suppose\r\nthat Roman doctors made on the average more than sufficient to keep\r\nthem decently.[453]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF THE METHODISTS.\r\n\r\nASCLEPIADES, of Prusa, in Bithynia, was a physician of great celebrity\r\nand influence, who flourished at Rome in the beginning of the first\r\ncentury B.C. He passed his earlier years at Alexandria, then went to\r\nAthens, where he studied rhetoric and medicine. He is said to have\r\ntravelled much. He ultimately settled at Rome as a rhetorician. He was\r\nthe friend of Cicero. Being unsuccessful as a teacher of rhetoric, he\r\ndevoted himself to medicine. He was a man of great natural ability,\r\nbut he was quite ignorant of anatomy and physiology; so he decried the\r\nlabours of those who studied these sciences, and violently attacked\r\nHippocrates. His conduct was that of an early Paracelsus. He had many\r\npupils, and the school they founded was afterwards called that of the\r\nMethodists. His system was original, though it owed somewhat to the\r\nEpicurean philosophy. He conceived the idea that disease arose in the\r\natoms and corpuscles composing the body, by a want of harmony in their\r\nmotion. Harmony was health; discord, disease. Naturally his treatment\r\nwas as pleasant as that of the most fashionable modern physician. He\r\npaid great attention to diet, passive motions, frictions after the\r\nmethod now called massage, and the use of cold sponging. He entirely\r\nrejected the humoral pathology of Hippocrates, and totally denied his\r\ndoctrine of crises, declared that the physician alone cures, nature\r\nmerely supplying the opportunities. His famous motto was that the\r\nphysician should cure “tuto, celeriter, ac jucunde.” In the beginning\r\nof fevers he refused his patients permission even to rinse the mouth.\r\nHe originated the method of cyclical cures by adopting certain methods\r\nof treatment at definite periods. He first applied the term “phrenitis”\r\nin the sense of mental disturbance. In drugs he was a sceptic, but he\r\nallowed a liberal use of wine. He was said to have experimented in\r\nphysiology, though he knew nothing of it. Tertullian ridicules him\r\nthus: “Asclepiades may investigate goats, which bleat without a heart,\r\nand drive away flies, which fly without a head.”\r\n\r\nAsclepiades must have been a great deal more than a charlatan, for\r\nmany of his fundamental ideas have persisted even to the present time.\r\nHe was the first to distinguish diseases into acute and chronic.[454]\r\nAcute diseases he supposed to depend “upon a constriction of the pores,\r\nor an obstruction of them by a superfluity of atoms; the chronic upon\r\na relaxation of the pores, or a deficiency of the atoms.” Asclepiades\r\nwas the inventor of many new methods in surgery and medicine. Amongst\r\nthese was bronchotomy for the relief of suffocation.[455] He practised\r\ntracheotomy in angina, and scarification of the ankles in dropsy, and\r\nrecommended tapping with the smallest possible wound. He also observed\r\nspontaneous dislocation of the hip joint.[456] Such things do not\r\nemanate from mere quacks.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that there were many physicians of the name of\r\nAsclepiades. It was a way they had of assuming a connection with the\r\nfamous medical family of that name.\r\n\r\nThe disciples of Asclepiades were called Asclepiadists. A few of them\r\nbecame celebrities in their day.\r\n\r\nPHILONIDES OF DYRRACHIUM lived in the first century, and wrote some\r\nforty-five works on medicine.\r\n\r\nANTONIUS MUSA lived at the beginning of the Christian era, and was\r\na freedman and physician to the Emperor Augustus. When his Imperial\r\npatient was seriously ill and had been made worse by a hot regimen and\r\ntreatment, Antonius cured him with cold bathing and cooling drinks.\r\nAugustus rewarded him with a royal fee and permission to wear a gold\r\nring, and a statue was erected to him near that of Æsculapius by public\r\nsubscription. He wrote several works on pharmacy. He was also physician\r\nto Horace.\r\n\r\nMUSA introduced into medicine the use of adder’s flesh in the treatment\r\nof malignant ulcers; he discovered some of the properties of lettuce,\r\nchicory, and endive. Many of his medicines continued in use for ages.\r\nFor colds he used the over-potent remedies henbane, hemlock, and opium.\r\nHe was also celebrated for various antidotes which he discovered.[457]\r\n\r\nHis brother, named EUPHORBIUS, was a physician also, and gave his name\r\nto a genus of plants, the _Euphorbiaceæ_ (Plin., lib. xxv., c. 7).\r\n\r\nTHEMISON OF LAODICEA (B.C. 50) was the founder of the school known as\r\nthe Methodical. This was a rival to that of the Hippocratic system,\r\nwhich had hitherto been the dominant one. Themison was the most\r\nimportant pupil of Asclepiades. He wrote on chronic diseases, and\r\nwas the first to describe elephantiasis in a treatise. He would have\r\nwritten upon hydrophobia, but having in his youth once seen a case,\r\nit so frightened him that he was attacked with some of the symptoms,\r\nand dreaded a relapse if he set himself to write about it.[458] He\r\ninvented several famous remedies, such as diacodium, a preparation of\r\npoppies, and diagrydium, a purgative of scammony. Asclepiades had his\r\n“atoms,” Themison had his “pores.” You cannot found a medical system\r\nwithout flying a particular flag. Themison’s “flag” was the “status\r\nstrictus,” or “laxus” of the pores; that is to say, disease is either\r\na condition of increased or diminished tension. He was the first who\r\ndescribed rheumatism, and probably the first European physician who\r\nused leeches.[459]\r\n\r\nHe is said to have been attacked with hydrophobia, and to have\r\nrecovered. Juvenal satirised him (probably) in the lines—\r\n\r\n    “How many patients Themison dispatched\r\n    In one short autumn!”[460]\r\n\r\nThemison’s principles differed from those of his master in many\r\nrespects, and besides rectifying his errors he introduced a greater\r\nprecision into his system.[461]\r\n\r\nHe chose a middle way between the doctrines of the Dogmatists and\r\nEmpirics. Writing of the Methodists, Celsus says: “They assert that\r\nthe knowledge of no cause whatever bears the least relation to the\r\nmethod of cure; and that it is sufficient to observe some general\r\nsymptoms of distempers; and that there are three kinds of diseases,\r\none bound, another loose, and the third a mixture of these.”[462]\r\nSometimes the excretions of the sick are too small, sometimes too\r\nlarge; one particular excretion may be in excess, another deficient;\r\nthe observation of these things constitutes the art of medicine, which\r\nthey defined as a certain way of proceeding, which the Greeks called\r\n_Method_. They deduced indications of treatment from analogies in\r\nsymptoms, and made a bold classification of diseases; accurate as a\r\nrule in their diagnosis, they were usually successful and rational in\r\ntheir therapeutics. They entirely ignored any consideration of the\r\nremote causes of diseases; their only object was to cure their patients\r\nwithout speculating as to the reasons why they had become sick. They\r\nrepudiated the _Vis medicatrix_ theory.\r\n\r\nEUDEMUS (B.C. 15) was a disciple of Themison. Cælius Aurelianus says\r\nof him that in his practice he used to order clysters of cold water\r\nfor patients suffering from the iliac passion. It is probable that he\r\nwas the friend and physician of Livilla, and the man who poisoned her\r\nhusband Drusus. Tacitus speaks of him, saying that he made a great\r\nparade of many secret remedies, with a view to extol his own abilities\r\nas a doctor. It is possible, however, that this may not have been\r\nthe same Eudemus as the disciple of Themison the Methodist, as there\r\nwere several other physicians of that name. Our Eudemus made many\r\nobservations on hydrophobia, and remarked how rarely any sufferer\r\nrecovered who was attacked by it. He was put to death by order of\r\nTiberius.\r\n\r\nMEGES, of Sidon (B.C. 20), was a famous surgeon, and a follower of\r\nThemison. He invented instruments used in cutting for the stone. He\r\nmade observations on tumours of the breast and forward dislocations of\r\nthe knee. He was regarded by Celsus as the most skilful of those who\r\nexercised the art of surgery.\r\n\r\nVECTIUS VALLENS (_circ._ A.D. 37) was a pupil of Apuleius Celsus, and\r\nwas well known for his connection with Messalina, the wife of Claudius.\r\nHe belonged to Themison’s sect, and is introduced by Pliny in fact as\r\nthe author of an improvement upon it. It was the practice of all the\r\nadherents of the Methodist school of medicine to pretend that by the\r\nchanges they had introduced into the system they had originated a new\r\none.[463]\r\n\r\nSCRIBONIUS LARGUS (A.D. 45) is said to have been physician to Claudius,\r\nand to have accompanied him to Britain. He wrote several medical works\r\nin Latin. He was the first to prescribe the electricity of the electric\r\nray in cases of headache.[464]\r\n\r\nA. CORNELIUS CELSUS, who flourished between B.C. 50 and A.D. 7, was\r\na celebrated patrician Roman writer on medicine, and an encyclopædic\r\ncompiler of a very high order. It is disputed whether he was or was\r\nnot a physician in actual practice; probably he was not. He practised\r\ncertainly, but on his friends and servants, and not professionally. The\r\nmedical practice of the period was for the most part in the hands of\r\nthe Greeks. We owe little to the Romans that was original or important\r\nin connection with the healing art, yet in Celsus we have an elegant\r\nand accomplished historian of the medical art as it was practised in\r\nancient Rome; he wrote not so much for doctors as for the instruction\r\nof the world at large. His works were not studied by medical men, at\r\nany rate, as anything more than mere literature. No medical writer of\r\nthe old world quotes Celsus. Pliny merely refers to him as an author.\r\nVery probably he merely compiled his treatises, of which the most\r\ncelebrated is his _De Medicina_, in the introductions to the 4th and\r\n8th books of which there is evidence of his considerable knowledge of\r\nanatomy. He seems to have understood the anatomy of the chest and the\r\nsituation of the greater viscera especially well, though of course in\r\nthis respect falling far short of our present knowledge of the science,\r\nand not in every case fully up to that of the Greeks. His knowledge\r\nof surgery was considerable, especially that of the pelvic organs of\r\nthe female. In osteology, or the science of the bones, he excelled.\r\nHe accurately describes the bones of the skull, their sutures, and the\r\nteeth. His descriptions of the vertebræ and ribs, the bones of the\r\npelvis and the upper and lower extremities, are accurate and careful.\r\nHe understood the articulations, and is careful to emphasize the fact\r\nthat cartilage is always found in their formation. He must have been\r\nacquainted with the perforated plate of the ethmoid bone, as he speaks\r\nof the many minute holes in the recess of the nasal cavities, and it is\r\neven inferred by Portal that he knew the semicircular canals.[465]\r\n\r\nThe 7th and 8th books of the _De re Medicina_ relate entirely to\r\nsurgery; this is of course Greek, which in its turn was probably\r\nof Egyptian and Indian origin. He describes operations such as we\r\nnow call “plastic,” for restoring lost or defective portions of the\r\nnose, lips, and ears. These are constantly claimed as triumphs of\r\nmodern surgery, and have been asserted to have been successful as the\r\nresult of information derived from experiments on living animals.\r\nHis description of lithotomy is that which was anciently practised\r\nin Alexandria, and was doubtless derived from India. Trephining the\r\nskull is described, and this again is proved not to have been invented\r\nin modern times, as some have thought. Even subcutaneous urethrotomy\r\nwas a practice followed in the time of Celsus. We have also the first\r\ndetailed description of the amputation of an extremity. Many ophthalmic\r\noperations are described according to the methods followed by the eye\r\nspecialists of Alexandria.[466]\r\n\r\nIn his eight books on medicine the first four deal with internal\r\ncomplaints, such as usually yield to careful dieting. The fifth\r\nand sixth are concerned with external disorders, and contain many\r\nprescriptions for their treatment. The seventh and eighth, as we have\r\nseen, are exclusively surgical. Celsus followed principally Hippocrates\r\nand Asclepiades as his authorities. He transfers many passages from the\r\nFather of Medicine word for word. His favourite author was Asclepiades,\r\nand it is for that reason that he is held to be of the Methodical\r\nschool of medicine. He was no believer in the mysterious numbers of the\r\nPythagorean, and was evidently quite free from slavish devotion, even\r\nto his great authorities in medicine.\r\n\r\nHe recommends that dislocations should be reduced before inflammation\r\nsets in. When fractures fail to unite, he recommends extension and\r\nrubbing together of the ends of the bone. He goes so far as to advise\r\ncutting down to the bone, and letting the fracture and wound heal\r\ntogether. He cautions against the use of purgatives in strangulated\r\nhernia, and gives directions for extracting foreign bodies from the\r\nears.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the works of Celsus, many operations of ancient\r\nsurgery would have remained to us undescribed. He writes at length on\r\nbleeding, and describes the double ligation (or tying) of bleeding\r\nvessels, and the division of the vessels between the ligatures: an\r\noperation which the defenders of experiments on animals claim to have\r\nbeen discovered by vivisection. His method of amputation in gangrene\r\nby a single circular cut was followed down to the seventeenth century.\r\nHe describes the process of catheterization, operations for goitre (or\r\nDerbyshire neck), the resection of the ribs, the use of enemas, and\r\nartificial feeding by them, an operation for cataract, ear diseases\r\nwhich are curable by the use of the ear syringe, extraction of teeth\r\nby forceps, fastening loose teeth by means of gold wire, and bursting\r\nhollow teeth by peppercorns pressed into them. He describes many of\r\nthe most difficult subjects of operative midwifery, and discriminates\r\nin various mental diseases. Sleep must be induced, he says, in cases\r\nof insanity, by narcotics, if it is absent. He treats eye diseases\r\nwith mild lotions and salves, and is the first writer to distinguish\r\nhallucinations of vision. He copies from Asclepiades his valuable rules\r\nof diet and simple methods of treatment, and from Hippocrates his\r\nmethods of recognising the signs of diseases and their prognosis.\r\n\r\n(I am indebted to the great work of Dr. Hermann Baas[467] for much of\r\nthe above digest of the writings of Celsus.)\r\n\r\nAt the time when Celsus described the practice of medicine in Europe,\r\nbleeding was practised more freely than was the custom in the days of\r\nthe great Greek physicians. The Romans went far beyond these. “It is\r\nnot,” said Celsus, “a new thing to let blood from the veins, but it\r\nis new that there is scarcely any malady in which blood is not drawn.\r\nFormerly they bled young men, and women who were not pregnant, but it\r\nhad not been seen till our days that children, pregnant women, and\r\nold men were bled.” And it would seem that already doctors had begun\r\nto bleed in almost every case, in every time of life, with or without\r\nreason, the unfortunate people who were under their care. They bled for\r\nhigh fever, when the body was flushed and the veins too full of blood;\r\nand they bled in cachexia and anæmia, when they had not enough blood,\r\nbut were full of “ill humours.” They bled in pleurisy and pneumonia,\r\nand they bled in paralysis, and cases where there was severe pain.\r\n\r\nCelsus has given us a good description of the qualities which a surgeon\r\nought to possess: he should be young, or at any rate not very old; his\r\nhand should be firm and steady, and never shake; he should be able to\r\nuse his left hand with as much dexterity as his right; his sight should\r\nbe acute and clear; his mind intrepid and pitiless, so that when he is\r\nengaged in doing anything to a patient, he may not hurry, nor cut less\r\nthan he ought, but finish the operation just as if the cries of the\r\npatient made no impression upon him.[468]\r\n\r\nCelsus said,[469] “It is both cruel and superfluous to dissect the\r\nbodies of the living, but to dissect those of the dead is necessary for\r\nlearners, for they ought to know the position and order, which dead\r\nbodies show better than a living and wounded man. But even the other\r\nthings, which can only be observed in the living, practice itself will\r\nshow in the cures of the wounded, a little more slowly, but somewhat\r\nmore tenderly.”\r\n\r\nHe wrote on history, philosophy, oratory, and jurisprudence, and this\r\nin the most admirable style.\r\n\r\nTHESSALUS of Tralles (A.D. 60) was the talented son of a weaver,\r\nwho became a “natural” doctor. He was an utterly ignorant, bragging\r\ncharlatan, with great natural ability. Had Paracelsus received no\r\neducation, he might have practised medicine as a second Thessalus\r\nof Tralles. He scorned science as much as Paracelsus loved it, but\r\nlike him he abused in the most violent manner all the physicians of\r\nantiquity. He called them all bunglers, and himself the “Conqueror of\r\nPhysicians” (ἰατροίκης). He declared to Nero that his predecessors\r\nhad contributed nothing to the progress of the science. He flattered\r\nthe great and wealthy, and vaunted his ability to teach anybody the\r\nhealing art in six months. He surrounded himself with a great crowd\r\nof disciples—rope-makers, cooks, butchers, weavers, tanners, artisans\r\nof all sorts. All these he permitted to practise on his patients,\r\nand to kill them with impunity. Since his time, says Sprengel, the\r\nRoman physicians gave up the custom of visiting their patients when\r\naccompanied by their pupils.[470] He used colchicum in the treatment of\r\ngout.\r\n\r\nPHILUMENUS (about A.D. 80) was a famous writer on obstetrics, and\r\ndescribed the appropriate treatment for the various kinds of diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nANDROMACHUS THE ELDER (A.D. 60) of Crete was the inventor of a famous\r\ncure-all called _Theriaca_. It was compounded of some sixty drugs. He\r\nwas physician to Nero, and his two works περὶ συνθεσέως φαρμάκων were\r\ngreatly praised by Galen.\r\n\r\nSORANUS OF EPHESUS, the son of Menandrus, was educated at Alexandria.\r\nHe practised at Rome in the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian. He was one\r\nof the most eminent physicians of the Methodical school, and was\r\nmentioned with praise by Tertullian and St. Augustine. He wrote the\r\nonly complete treatise on the diseases of women which antiquity has\r\ngiven to us. We find from this work that a valuable instrument used\r\nin gynæcology, and thought by many to be of modern invention—the\r\nspeculum—was mentioned by Soranus as used by him. Amongst the articles\r\nused by surgeons which have been recovered from the ruins of Pompeii,\r\nthese instruments have been discovered, showing that they were in\r\nregular use in ancient times. He seems to have had a complete knowledge\r\nof human anatomy, for he describes the uterus in such a manner as to\r\nshow that his knowledge was acquired by dissecting the human body,\r\nand not merely from that of animals. He explained the changes induced\r\nby pregnancy, and spoke of the sympathy existing between the uterus\r\nand the breasts, which is so important for the physician to know. He\r\nmust have had a greater knowledge of the scourge of leprosy than his\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nSoranus, in his work on gynæcology, advises that midwives should be\r\ntemperate, trustworthy, not avaricious, superstitious, or liable\r\nto be induced to procure abortion for the sake of gain. They were\r\nto be instructed in dietetics, materia medica, and minor surgical\r\nmanipulations. Soranus did not think it was requisite for them to know\r\nmuch about the anatomy of the pelvic organs, but they were to be able\r\nto undertake the operation of turning in faulty presentations. Only\r\nwhen all attempts to deliver a living child had failed was embryotomy\r\nto be performed. Juvenal and other writers intimate that these\r\naccomplished accoucheuses often developed into regular doctresses. In\r\ndifficult cases they called in the assistance of physicians or surgeons.\r\n\r\nJULIAN (A.D. 140) was the pupil of Apollinides of Cyprus. He was at\r\nAlexandria when Galen studied there. He wrote an introduction to the\r\nstudy of medicine, and opposed the principles of Hippocrates. Like the\r\ngreater number of the Methodists he was ill-read, and Galen blamed him\r\nfor having neglected the humoral pathology.[471]\r\n\r\nCÆLIUS AURELIANUS was a celebrated Latin physician, who is supposed\r\nto have lived in Rome about the first or second century. Very little\r\nis known about him, but the fact that he belonged to the Methodical\r\nschool, and showed great skill in the art of diagnosis.\r\n\r\nHe wrote treatises on acute and chronic diseases, and a dialogue on\r\nthe science of medicine. Next to Celsus, he is considered the greatest\r\nwriter of his school. His works are based entirely on the Greek of\r\nSoranus.\r\n\r\nHe was a popular writer, as is proved by the fact that in the sixth\r\ncentury his works were text-books on medicine in the Benedictine\r\nmonasteries. He has well described gout and hydrophobia, and, according\r\nto Baas, was the inventor of condensed milk (!). Even auscultation\r\nis hinted at in his works, and he recommends the air of pine forests\r\nin chest diseases. His suggestions for the treatment of nervous and\r\ninsane patients were far in advance of his age, as he disapproves of\r\nrestraint.[472]\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEK AND ROMAN PHARMACY.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to decide with certainty what the ancients\r\nactually intended by the names they gave their medicines. Exact as\r\nHippocrates and Galen usually are in their terminology, we are often\r\nat a loss to know precisely what was the nature of the remedies they\r\nemployed. Alum, for example, as we understand it, is a very different\r\nthing from the alum of the ancients. What the Greeks and Romans called\r\n_alumen_ and στυπτηρία, says Beckmann, was vitriol, or rather a kind\r\nof vitriolic earth. They were very deficient in the knowledge of\r\nsaline substances. Hemlock, which is called also _Conium_, Κώνειον, or\r\n_Cicuta_, was probably not the poison employed at Athenian executions.\r\nPliny says that the word _Cicuta_ did not indicate any particular\r\nspecies of plant, but was used for vegetable poisons in general. Dr.\r\nMead[473] considers that the Athenian poison was a combination of\r\ndeadly drugs; it killed without pain, and probably opium was combined\r\nwith the hemlock.[474] Hellebore was of two kinds, white and black,\r\nor _Veratrum album_ and _Helleborus niger_ respectively. Galen says\r\nwe are always to understand veratrum when the word Ἑλλέβορος is used\r\nalone. White hellebore was used by the Greeks, says Stillé,[475] in\r\nthe treatment of chronic diseases, especially melancholy, insanity,\r\ndropsy, skin diseases, gout, tetanus, hydrophobia, tic doloureux, etc.\r\nIt was mixed with other drugs to moderate the violence of its action.\r\nIt fell into disuse, and is now hardly ever employed internally. It\r\nis an exceedingly dangerous drug, and was doubtless used on the “kill\r\nor cure” principle. Black hellebore was given as a purgative. Healthy\r\npeople took the white variety to clear and sharpen their faculties.\r\nIt fell into disuse about the fifth century after Christ. A very\r\ncelebrated medicine in popular use even in modern times was _Theriaca_.\r\nGalen says that the term was properly applied to such medicines as\r\nwould cure the bite of wild beasts (θηρίων), as those which were\r\nantidotes to other poisons (τοῖς δηλητηρίυις) were properly called\r\nἀλεξιφάρμακα.[476]\r\n\r\nAndromachus, physician to the emperor Nero, invented the most\r\ncelebrated of these preparations; it was known as the _Theriaca\r\nAndromachi_, and was very similar to that of Mithridates, king of\r\nPontus, the recipe for which was said to have been found amongst\r\nhis papers after his death by Pompey. This was known to the Roman\r\nphysicians under the name of _Antidotum Mithridatium_. The composition\r\nof this medicine was varied greatly in the hands of its different\r\npreparers, and it underwent considerable alterations from age to age.\r\nCelsus first described it, with its thirty-six ingredients; then\r\nAndromachus added to it the flesh of vipers, and increased the number\r\nof ingredients to seventy-five. He described the whole process of\r\nmanufacture in a Greek poem, which has been handed down to us by Galen.\r\nDamocrates varied some of the proportions of the compound, and wrote\r\nanother poem upon it, also preserved by Galen.\r\n\r\nThe medicines prescribed by the Greek and Roman physicians were all\r\nprepared by themselves. At that time materia medica consisted chiefly\r\nof herbs; some of these plants were used not only for medicinal,\r\nbut also for culinary purposes, and were collected by other than\r\npractitioners of medicine. Many plants were used also for cosmetic\r\npurposes and in the baths, so that there must have been numerous\r\ncollectors and dealers in herbs. Just as in our time dispensing\r\nchemists and others have acquired a certain knowledge of the medicinal\r\nvirtues of the things they sell, so the _pigmentarii_, _seplasiarii_,\r\n_pharmacopolæ_, and _medicamentarii_ possessed themselves of medical\r\nsecrets, and thus invaded the territory of the doctors.\r\n\r\nBeckmann says[477] that the _pigmentarii_ dealt in medicines, and\r\nsometimes sold poison by mistake.\r\n\r\nThe _seplasiarii_ sold veterinary medicines and compounded drugs for\r\nphysicians.[478]\r\n\r\nThe _pharmacopolæ_, according to Beckmann, were an ignorant and\r\nboasting class of drug-sellers. The _medicamentarii_ seem to have been\r\na still more worthless class, for in the Theodosian code poisoners are\r\ncalled medicamentarii.\r\n\r\nA great number of the medical plants mentioned by Pliny, Dioscorides,\r\nand other writers on materia medica were used for quite other purposes\r\nthan those for which we employ them now. Some drugs, however, were\r\napparently given on what we must admit to be correct scientific\r\nprinciples. Thus Melampus of Argos, one of the oldest Greek physicians\r\nof whom we have any knowledge, is said to have cured Iphiclus of\r\nsterility by administering rust of iron in wine for ten days.\r\n\r\nHe gave black hellebore as a purgative to the daughters of Proetus when\r\nthey were afflicted with melancholy. Preparations of the poppy were\r\nknown to have a narcotic influence, and the uses of prussic acid—in\r\nthe form of cherry laurel water—stramonium, and lettuce-opium were\r\nwell understood. Squill was employed as a diuretic in dropsy by the\r\nEgyptians.\r\n\r\n The following list from the article on “Pharmaceutica” in Smith’s\r\n _Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities_ contains probably the\r\n titles of all the ancient treatises on drugs that are extant: “1. Περὶ\r\n Φαρμάκων, _De Remediis Purgantibus_; 2. Περὶ Ἑλλεβορισμοῦ, _De Veratri\r\n Usu_ (these two works are found among the collection that goes under\r\n the name of Hippocrates, but are both spurious); 3. Dioscorides, Περὶ\r\n Ὕλης Ἰατρικῆς, _De Materia Medica_, in five books (one of the most\r\n valuable and celebrated medical treatises of antiquity); 4. id. Περὶ\r\n Εὐπορίστων, Ἁπλῶν τε καὶ Συνθέτων, Φαρμάκων, _De Facile Parabilibus,\r\n tam Simplicibus quam Compositis, Medicamentis_, in two books (perhaps\r\n spurious); 5. Marcellus Sideta, Ἰατρικὰ περὶ Ἰχθύων, _De Remediis ex\r\n Piscibus_; 6. Galen, Περὶ Κράσεως καὶ Δυνάμεως τῶν Ἁπλῶν Φαρμάκων,\r\n _De Simplicium Medicamentorum Temperamentis et Facultatibus_, in\r\n eleven books; 7. _id._ Περὶ Συνθέσεως Φαρμάκων τῶν κατὰ Τόπους, _De\r\n Compositione Medicamentorum secundum Locos_, in ten books; 8. _id._\r\n Περὶ Συνθέσεως Φαρμάκων τῶν κατὰ Γένη, _De Compositione Medicamentorum\r\n secundum Genera_, in seven books; 9. _id._ Περὶ τῆς τῶν Καθαιρόντων\r\n Φαρμάκων Δυνάμεως, _De Purgantium Medicamentorum Facultate_ (perhaps\r\n spurious); 10. Oribasius, Συναγωγαὶ Ἰατρικαί, _Collecta Medicinalia_,\r\n consisting originally of seventy books, of which we possess now\r\n only about one third; 11. _id._ Εὐπόριστα, _Euporista ad Eunapium_,\r\n or _De facile Parabilibus_, in four books, of which the second\r\n contains an alphabetical list of drugs; 12. _id._ Σύνοψις, _Synopsis\r\n ad Eustathium_, an abridgment of his larger work in nine books, of\r\n which the second, third, and fourth are upon the subject of external\r\n and internal remedies; 13. Paulus Ægineta, Ἐπιτομῆς Ἰατρικῆς Βιβλία\r\n Ἕπτα, _Compendii Medici Libri Septem_, of which the last treats of\r\n medicines; 14. Joannes Actuarius, _De Medicamentorum Compositione_;\r\n 15. Nicolaus Myrepsus, _Antidotarium_; 16. Cato, _De Re Rustica_;\r\n 17. Celsus, _De Medicina Libri Octo_, of which the fifth treats of\r\n different sorts of medicines; 18. Twelve books of Pliny’s, _Historia\r\n Naturalis_ (from the twentieth to the thirty-second), are devoted to\r\n Materia Medica; 19. Scribonius Largus, _Compositiones Medicamentorum_;\r\n 20. Apuleius Barbarus, _Herbarium, seu de Medicaminibus Herbarum_;\r\n 21. Sextus Placitus Papyriensis, _De Medicamentis ex Animalibus_;\r\n 22. Marcellus Empiricus, _De Medicamentis Empiricis, Physicis, ac\r\n Rationalibus_.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the Greeks and Romans knew little of chemistry as we\r\nunderstand the term, they must have possessed considerable skill in the\r\nart of secret poisoning, either with intent to kill or to obtain undue\r\ninfluence over certain persons.\r\n\r\nPoisonous drugs were used as philtres or love-potions, and we know from\r\nDemosthenes[479] that drugs were administered in Athens to influence\r\nmen to make wills in a desired manner. Women were most addicted to the\r\ncrime of poisoning amongst the Greeks. They were called φαρμακίδες\r\nand φαρμακευτρίαι. By the Romans the crime of poisoning was called\r\nVeneficium; and here again, as in other times and places, it was\r\nmost usually practised by women. It lent itself to the weakness of\r\nthe gentler sex, who could not avenge their injuries by arms, and\r\nthere is little doubt that many women were as unjustly suspected of\r\npoisoning as we know they were of witchcraft in an ignorant age when\r\npestilence and obscure diseases filled the minds of the people with\r\nfear and suspicion. Thucydides tells us[480] the Athenians in the time\r\nof the great pestilence believed that their wells had been poisoned\r\nby their enemies. When the city of Rome was visited by a pestilence\r\nin the year 331 B.C., a slave girl informed the curule aediles that\r\nthe Roman matrons had caused the deaths of many of the leading men of\r\nthe State by poisoning them. On this information about twenty matrons,\r\nsome of whom, as Cornelia and Sergia, belonged to patrician families,\r\nwere detected in the act of preparing poisonous compounds over a fire.\r\nThey protested that they were innocent concoctions; the magistrates\r\ncompelling them to drink these in the Forum, they suffered the death\r\nthey had prepared for others. Locusta was a celebrated female poisoner\r\nunder the Roman emperors. She poisoned Claudius at the command of\r\nAgrippina, and Britannicus at that of Nero, who even provided her\r\nwith pupils to be instructed in her deadly art. Tacitus tells the\r\nstory,[481] Suetonius says,[482] that the poison she administered to\r\nBritannicus being too slow in its action, Nero forced her by blows and\r\nthreats to make a stronger draught in his presence, which killed the\r\nvictim immediately. She was executed under the emperor Galba.\r\n\r\nClement of Alexandria refers to the Susinian ointment in use in his\r\ntime, which was made from lilies, and was “warming, aperient, drawing,\r\nmoistening, abstergent, antibilious, and emollient,” a truly marvellous\r\nunguent indeed if it possessed only half of these virtues. He tells\r\nof another ointment called the Myrsinian, which was made from myrtle\r\nberries, and was “a styptic, stopping effusions from the body; and that\r\nfrom roses is refrigerating.”[483]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRUFUS OF EPHESUS, the anatomist, has left us in his works interesting\r\ndetails concerning the state of anatomical science at Alexandria before\r\nthe time of Galen. In one of his works he says, “The ancients called\r\nthe arteries of the neck carotids, because they believed that, when\r\npressed hard, the animal became sleepy and lost its voice; but in our\r\nage it has been discovered that this accident does not proceed from\r\npressing upon these arteries, but upon the nerves contiguous to them.”\r\nHe is said to have practised the twisting of arteries for arresting\r\nhæmorrhage, a method universally followed at the present day. It is\r\ncurious that though the ligature and this valuable method of torsion\r\nwere both known to the ancients, they fell into abeyance in favour of\r\nthe actual cautery.\r\n\r\nSENECA, the philosopher (A.D. 3-65), had a very high opinion of the\r\nhealing art. Perhaps no one has said truer and kinder things of doctors\r\nthan this philosopher. “People pay the doctor for his trouble; for his\r\nkindness they still remain in his debt.” “Thinkest thou that thou owest\r\nthe doctor and the teacher nothing more than his fee? We think that\r\ngreat reverence and love are due to both. We have received from them\r\npriceless benefits: from the doctor, health and life; from the teacher,\r\nthe noble culture of the soul. Both are our friends, and deserve our\r\nmost sincere thanks, not so much by their merchantable art, as by their\r\nfrank good will.”[484]\r\n\r\nAPOLLONIUS of Tyana, the Pythagorean philosopher, was born four years\r\nbefore Christ. His reputation as a miracle-worker and healer was used\r\nby the enemies of the Christian faith in ancient times to bring him\r\nforward as a rival to the Author of our Religion.[485] The attempt\r\nto make him appear a pagan Christ has since been revived.[486] He\r\nadopted the Pythagorean philosophy at the age of sixteen. He renounced\r\nanimal food and wine, used only linen garments and sandals made of\r\nbark, suffered his hair to grow, and betook himself to the temple of\r\nÆsculapius, who appears to have regarded him with peculiar favour.\r\nHe observed the silence of five years, which was one of the methods\r\nof initiation into the esoteric doctrines of the Pythagoreans. He\r\ntravelled in India, and learned the valuable theurgic secrets of the\r\nBrahmans; in the cities of Asia Minor he had some interviews with the\r\nMagi; visited the temples and oracles of Greece, where he sometimes\r\nexercised his skill in healing; then he went to Rome, where he was\r\nbrought before Nero on the charge of magical practices, which was\r\nnot sustained. In his seventy-third year he attracted the notice of\r\nVespasian. Afterwards he travelled in Ethiopia. Returning to Rome, he\r\nwas imprisoned by Domitian, and had his hair cut short, because he had\r\nforetold the pestilence at Ephesus. He died at the age of an hundred\r\nyears. It is to be remarked that he never put forward any miraculous\r\npretensions himself; he seems merely to have been a learned philosopher\r\nwho had travelled widely and acquired vast information from distant\r\nsources. The history manufactured for him is plainly an imitation from\r\nthat of our Lord, concocted by persons interested in degrading the\r\ncharacter of Christ.[487]\r\n\r\nPLINY THE ELDER (23-79 A.D.), the author of the immense encyclopædic\r\nwork, his famous _Natural History_, was not a man of genius, nor even\r\nan original observer, his work is but a compilation, and contains\r\nmore falsehood than fact, and more absurdities than either. He cannot\r\nbe called a naturalist, though he wrote on natural history; nor a\r\nphysician, though he wrote of diseases and their remedies. His work is\r\nvaluable chiefly as a picture of the general knowledge of his time. The\r\nfollowing is an example of the medical lore of the period. Pliny says\r\nthat a woman dreamt that some one was directed to send to her son, a\r\nsoldier in Spain, some roots of the dog-rose. It happened that exactly\r\nat that time her son had been bitten by a mad dog, and had received a\r\nletter from his mother, who had dreamt about him, and she begged him to\r\nuse these roots as she directed. He did so, and was “protected” from\r\nhydrophobia, as were many others of his friends who adopted the same\r\ntreatment. Thus it was that the wild-rose was called the dog-rose.\r\n\r\nDIOSCORIDES lived in the first or second century of our era. He was\r\na physician who rendered greater services than any other to Materia\r\nMedica. His work on this subject was the result of immense labour and\r\nresearch, and remained for ages the standard authority; it contained\r\na description of everything used in medicine, and is a most valuable\r\ndocument for the historian of the healing art of the period. Galen\r\nhighly valued the work of Dioscorides, which must have been of the\r\ngreatest use to the doctors of the time, who were obliged to prepare\r\ntheir own medicines. Drugs were so much adulterated that it was unsafe\r\nto procure them from the stores in Rome.\r\n\r\nMARINUS was a famous anatomist, who lived in the first and second\r\ncenturies after Christ. Galen’s tutor Quintus was one of his pupils. He\r\nwrote many works on anatomy, which Galen abridged and praised, saying\r\nthat he was one of the restorers of anatomical science.\r\n\r\nQUINTUS, an eminent Roman physician of the second century, was a pupil\r\nof Marinus. He was celebrated for his knowledge of anatomy.\r\n\r\nZENON lived in the fourth century, and taught medicine at Alexandria.\r\nJulian (A.D. 361 _circ._) wrote in very high terms of the medical skill\r\nof this physician.\r\n\r\nMAGNUS OF ALEXANDRIA was a pupil of the above, who lectured on medicine\r\nat Alexandria, where he was very famous. He wrote a work on the urine.\r\n\r\nIONICUS OF SARDIS studied under Zenon. He was not only distinguished\r\nin all branches of medicine, but was versed in rhetoric, logic, and\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nTHEON OF ALEXANDRIA, of very uncertain period, probably in the fourth\r\ncentury after Christ, wrote a celebrated book on _Man_, in which he\r\ntreated of diseases in a systematic order, and also of pharmacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nLATER ROMAN MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n The Eclectic and Pneumatic Sects.—Galen.—Neo-Platonism.—Oribasius and\r\n Ætius.—Influence of Christianity and the Rise of Hospitals.—Paulus\r\n Ægineta.—Ancient Surgical Instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECT OF THE PNEUMATISTS.\r\n\r\nATHENÆUS OF CILICIA about A.D. 69 founded at Rome the SECT OF THE\r\nPNEUMATISTS, at the time when the Methodists enjoyed their greatest\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nThey admitted an active principle of an immaterial nature, to which\r\nthey gave the name of πνεῦμα, spirit. This principle caused the health\r\nor the diseases of the body, and the sect was named from it. Athenæus\r\nwas a Stoic, who had adopted the doctrines of the Peripatetics. In\r\naddition to the _pneuma_, he developed the theory of the elements, and\r\nin them recognised the positive qualities of the animal frame. The\r\nunion of heat and moisture is necessary for the preservation of health.\r\nHeat and dryness cause acute diseases, cold and moisture produce\r\nphlegmatic disorders, cold and dryness give rise to melancholy. At\r\ndeath, all things dry up and become cold.[488]\r\n\r\nGreat services to pathology were rendered by the Pneumatic sect.\r\nSeveral new diseases were discovered by them; but they over refined\r\ntheir doctrines, especially that of fevers and the pulse; they\r\nthought this alternate contraction and dilatation of the arteries\r\nwas the operation of the _pneuma_, or spirit passing from the heart.\r\n_Diastole_ or _dilatation_ pushes forward the spirit, the _systole_ or\r\n_contraction_ draws it back.[489]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECT OF THE ECLECTICS\r\n\r\nDerived their name from the fact that they selected from each of the\r\nother sects the opinions that seemed most probable. They seem to have\r\nagreed very nearly, if they were not actually identical with the sect\r\nknown as the EPISYNTHETICS. They endeavoured to join the tenets of the\r\nMethodici to those of the Empiric and Dogmatic sects, and to reconcile\r\ntheir differences.[490]\r\n\r\nAmongst the most famous of the school were AGATHINUS OF SPARTA (1st\r\ncent. A.D.), who founded the Episynthetic sect, though Galen refers\r\nto him as among the Pneumatici. He was a pupil of Athenæus, and the\r\ntutor of Archigenes. None of his writings are extant. THEODORUS was a\r\nphysician mentioned by Pliny.[491]\r\n\r\nARCHIGENES OF APAMÆA, who practised in Rome (A.D. 98-117), was\r\nexceedingly famous. He is mentioned several times by Juvenal,[492]\r\nand was the most celebrated of the sect. He wrote on the pulse, and\r\nattempted the classification of fevers. Very few fragments of his works\r\nremain. He was the first to treat dysentery with opium.\r\n\r\nARETÆUS OF CAPPADOCIA (1st cent, A.D.) was a celebrated Greek physician\r\nwho wrote on diseases, detailing their symptoms with great accuracy and\r\ndisplaying great skill in diagnosis. He was very little biased by any\r\npeculiar opinions, and his observations on diseases and their treatment\r\nhave stood the light of our modern medical science better than those of\r\nmany of the ancient authorities. He was acquainted with the fact that\r\ninjuries to the brain cause paralysis on the opposite side; and his\r\nclassification of mental diseases is as good as our own. His knowledge\r\nof anatomy was considerable, and in his physiology he shows how much\r\nmore the ancients knew of this branch of science than is generally\r\nsupposed. He was acquainted with the operation of tracheotomy, and\r\nremarked its partial success.[493]\r\n\r\nHe considered elephantiasis to be contagious, and gives this caution:\r\n“That it is not less dangerous to converse and live with persons\r\naffected with this distemper, than with those infected with the plague;\r\nbecause the contagion is communicated by the inspired air.”[494]\r\n\r\nHERODOTUS (there were several of the name) was a physician of repute\r\nin Rome (about A.D. 100). He was a pupil of Athenæus or Agathinus, and\r\nwrote several medical books which are quoted by Galen and Oribasius.\r\nHe first recommended pomegranate root as a remedy for tape-worm, and\r\ndescribed several infectious diseases.[495]\r\n\r\nHELIODORUS (about A.D. 100) was a famous surgeon, and wrote on\r\namputations and injuries of the head. His operation for scrotal hernia\r\nis described by Haeser as “a brilliant example of the surgical skill of\r\nthe Empire.” He treated stricture of the urethra by internal section.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS FELIX lived in the first century after Christ, and was the\r\nauthor of a curious set of eighty-four medical questions and their\r\nanswers. He was also called CASSIUS IATROSOPHISTA.\r\n\r\nLEONIDAS of Alexandria lived in the second or third century after\r\nChrist, was a distinguished surgeon, who operated on strumous glands,\r\nand amputated by the flap operation.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIUS GALENUS, commonly called Galen, or, as mediæval writers named\r\nhim, Gallien, was a very celebrated physician and philosopher, who\r\nwas born at Pergamos in Asia, A.D. 131, under Hadrian. His father,\r\nNicon, was an architect and geometrician, a highly cultivated and\r\nestimable man. His mother was a passionate scold, who led her husband\r\na worse life than Xantippe led Socrates. Nicon spared no pains to\r\ngive his son an education which should fit him to be a philosopher,\r\nand in his fifteenth year he was a pupil of the Stoic, Platonist,\r\nPeripatetic, and Epicurean philosophies. In his seventeenth year his\r\nfather, in consequence of a dream, changed his intentions concerning\r\nhis son’s profession, and determined that he should study medicine. His\r\nfirst tutors were Æschrion, Satyrus, and Stratonicus. He studied the\r\ndoctrines of all the sects of medicine in the school of Alexandria, and\r\ntravelled in Egypt, Greece, Asia, and Italy. He devoted himself to none\r\nof the schools of medicine whose doctrines he had studied, but struck\r\nout a path for himself. On his return to Pergamos, he was selected to\r\ntake charge of the wounded gladiators, a position which afforded him\r\nopportunities for studying surgical operations. He filled this post\r\nwith great reputation and success. When he was thirty-four years old\r\nhe went to Rome for the first time, remaining there four years, and\r\nacquiring a great reputation for his knowledge of anatomy, physiology,\r\nand medicine. He was connected with many persons of great influence,\r\nand his popularity at last became so great that it excited the ill-will\r\nof his professional brethren, especially as by his lecturing, writing,\r\nand disputing, his name was constantly before them. So great was the\r\nill-feeling they bore towards him that he was afraid of being poisoned.\r\nHe was called the “wonder speaker” and the “wonder worker.”\r\n\r\n“The greatest savant of all the ancient physicians,” says Sprengel,\r\n“was Galen. He strove to introduce into medicine a severe dogmatism,\r\nand to give it a scientific appearance, borrowed almost entirely\r\nfrom the Peripatetic school. The enormous number of his works, the\r\nsystematic order which distinguishes them, and the elegance of their\r\nstyle, won over, as by an irresistible charm, the indolent physicians\r\nwho succeeded him, so that during many ages his system was considered\r\nas immovable.”[496]\r\n\r\nFor thirteen centuries his name and influence dominated the medical\r\nprofession in Europe, Asia, and Africa; and this influence, under\r\nthe name of Galenism, was paramount in the eighteenth century,\r\nnotwithstanding the discovery of the circulation of the blood and\r\nother great advances in science. Galen collected and co-ordinated all\r\nthe medical knowledge which previous physicians and anatomists had\r\nacquired. He was no mere collector of, or compiler of other men’s\r\nworks; but he enriched previous acquirements by his own observation,\r\nand was in every way a man greatly in advance of his time. “A great\r\nand profound spirit,” says Daremberg, “he was philosopher as well as\r\nphysician, realising the aspiration of Hippocrates when he said that\r\nthe physician who should be also a philosopher must be the equal of\r\nthe gods. A dialectician like Aristotle, a psychologist like Plato,\r\nwho glorified his work by his genius for interpreting nature and\r\nlife, his position as philosopher would have been beside those men,\r\nif his devotion to medicine had not called him to another sphere of\r\nintellectual activity.” Nevertheless, Galen did in fact occupy an\r\nexalted position in the history of philosophy, not only in the West,\r\nbut amongst the Arabians. His encyclopædic knowledge, his spirit of\r\nobservation, and his influence on the thought of the middle ages,\r\ncompel a comparison with Aristotle. It was thus that the vast body\r\nof medical material collected by the various sects and schools was\r\nanalysed by the penetrating genius of Galen, whose philosophical and\r\nscientific mind was able to extract the good and permanent from the\r\nworthless and ephemeral material, which encumbered the literature\r\nof the healing art. He fell under the domination of none of the\r\nschools, though in one sense he may be said to have leaned towards\r\nthe Dogmatists, “for his method was to reduce all his knowledge,\r\nas acquired by the observation of facts, to general theoretical\r\nprinciples.”[497] He endeavoured to draw the student of medicine back\r\nto Hippocrates, of whom he was an admirer and expounder. The labours\r\nof Galen had the effect of destroying the vitality of the old medical\r\nsects; they became merged in his system, and left off wrangling\r\namongst themselves to imitate the new master who had arisen. A crowd\r\nof new writers found in the works of Galen abundant material for their\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nPartly in consequence of this jealousy, and partly from the fact that\r\nin A.D. 167 a pestilence broke out in Rome, he left the city privately,\r\nand returned to his native country.\r\n\r\nGalen, as a profound anatomist and physiologist, recognised final\r\ncauses, a purpose in all parts of the bodies which he dissected; and it\r\nis, as Whewell points out,[498] impossible for a really great anatomist\r\nto do other than recognise these. He cannot doubt that the nerves run\r\nalong the limbs, _in order_ that they may convey the impulses of the\r\nwill to the muscles: he cannot doubt that the muscles are attached to\r\nthe bones, _in order_ that they move and support them.\r\n\r\nThe development of this conviction, that there is a purpose in the\r\nparts of animals of a function to which every organ is subservient,\r\ngreatly contributed to the progress of physiology; it compelled men\r\nto work till they had discovered what the purpose is. Galen declared\r\nthat it is easy to say with some impotent pretenders that Nature has\r\nworked to no purpose. He has an enthusiastic scorn of the folly of\r\natheism.[499] “Try,” he says, “if you can imagine a shoe made with\r\nhalf the skill which appears in the skin of the foot.” Somebody had\r\nexpressed a desire for some structure of the human body over that\r\nwhich Nature has provided. “See,” he exclaims, “what brutishness there\r\nis in this wish. But if I were to spend more words on such cattle,\r\nreasonable men might blame me for desecrating my work, which I regard\r\nas a religious hymn in honour of the Creator. True piety does not\r\nconsist in immolating hecatombs, or in bearing a thousand delicious\r\nperfumes in His honour, but in recognising and loudly proclaiming His\r\nwisdom, almighty power, love and goodness. The Father of universal\r\nnature has proved His goodness in wisely providing for the happiness of\r\nall His creatures, in giving to each that which is most really useful\r\nfor them. Let us celebrate Him then by our hymns and chants! He has\r\nshown His infinite wisdom in choosing the best means for contriving\r\nHis beneficent ends; He has given proof of His omnipotence in creating\r\neverything perfectly conformable to its destination.”\r\n\r\nAnatomy must have reached a high standard before Galen’s time, as\r\nwe learn from his corrections of the mistakes and defects of his\r\npredecessors. He remarks that some anatomists have made one muscle into\r\ntwo, from its having two heads; that they have overlooked some of the\r\nmuscles in the face of an ape in consequence of not skinning the animal\r\nwith their own hands. This shows that the anatomists before Galen’s\r\ntime had a tolerably complete knowledge of the science. But Galen\r\ngreatly advanced it. He observes that the skeleton may be compared\r\nto the pole of a tent or the walls of a house. His knowledge of the\r\naction of the muscles was anatomically and mechanically correct. His\r\ndiscoveries and descriptions even of the very minute parts of the\r\nmuscular system are highly praised by modern anatomists.[500]\r\n\r\nHe knew the necessity of the nerve supply to the muscle, and that the\r\nbrain originated the consequent motion of a muscle so supplied, and\r\nproved the fact experimentally by cutting through some of the nerves\r\nand so paralysing the part.[501] Where the origin of the nerve is,\r\nthere, he said, it is admitted by all physicians and philosophers\r\nis the seat of the soul. This, he adds, is in the brain and not in\r\nthe heart. The principles of voluntary motion were well understood,\r\ntherefore, by Galen, and he must have possessed “clear mechanical views\r\nof what the tensions of collections of strings could do, and an exact\r\npractical acquaintance with the muscular cordage which exists in the\r\nanimal frame:—in short, in this as in other instances of real advance\r\nin science, there must have been clear ideas and real facts, unity of\r\nthought and extent of observation, brought into contact.”[502]\r\n\r\nHe observed that although a ligature on the inguinal or axillary artery\r\ncauses the pulse to cease in the leg or in the arm, the operation is\r\nnot permanently injurious, and that even the carotid arteries may be\r\ntied with impunity. He corrects the error of those who, in tying the\r\ncarotids, omitted to separate the contiguous nerves, and then wrongly\r\nconcluded that the consequent loss of voice was due to compression of\r\nthe arteries.\r\n\r\nGalen was the first and greatest authority on the pulse, if not our\r\nsole authority; for all subsequent writers simply transferred his\r\nteaching on this subject bodily to their own works.[503]\r\n\r\nBriefly it was as follows: “The pulse consists of four parts, of a\r\ndiastole and a systole, with two intervals of rest, one after the\r\ndiastole before the systole, the other after the systole before the\r\ndiastole.”[504]\r\n\r\nHis therapeutics were based on these two principles:—“1. That disease\r\nis something contrary to nature, and is to be overcome by that which is\r\ncontrary to the disease itself; and 2. That nature is to be preserved\r\nby that which has relation with nature.”[505]\r\n\r\nThe affection contrary to nature must be overcome, and the strength\r\nof the body has to be preserved. But while the _cause_ of the disease\r\ncontinues to operate, we must endeavour to remove it; we are not to\r\ntreat symptoms merely, for they will disappear when their cause is\r\nremoved, and we must consider the constitution and condition of the\r\npatient before we proceed to treat him.\r\n\r\n“Such as are essentially of a good constitution are such in whose\r\nbodies heat, coldness, dryness, and moisture are equally tempered; the\r\ninstruments of the body are composed in every part of due bigness,\r\nnumber, place, and formation.”[506] He gives in succeeding chapters\r\nthe signs of a hot, cold, dry, moist, hot and dry, hot and moist, cold\r\nand dry, and cold and moist brain; of a heart overheated, of a heart\r\ntoo cold, of a dry and of a moist heart, of a heart hot and dry, hot\r\nand moist, cold and moist, cold and dry heart. The liver is described\r\nunder the same conditions.\r\n\r\nGalen’s surgery is not of very great importance, but he is credited\r\nwith the resection of a portion of the sternum for caries and with\r\nligature of the temporal artery.[507]\r\n\r\nHe applied the doctrine of the four elements to his theories of\r\ndiseases. “Fire is hot and dry; air is hot and moist; for the air is\r\nlike a vapour; water is cold and moist, and earth is cold and dry.”\r\n\r\nGalen’s pathology is explained by Sprengel thus: when the body is free\r\nfrom pain, and performs its functions without obstacle, it is in a\r\nstate of health; when the functions are disturbed, there is a state of\r\ndisease. The effect of disturbed functions is _the affection_ (πάθος);\r\nthat which determines this injury is the cause of the disease, the\r\nsensible effects of which are the symptoms.\r\n\r\nDiseases (διάθεσις) are unnatural states either of the similar parts\r\nor of the organs themselves. Those of the similar parts proceed in\r\ngeneral from the want of proportion among the elements, of which one\r\nor two predominate. In this manner arise eight different dyscrasies,\r\nor ill states of the constitution. Symptoms consist either in deranged\r\nfunction or vicious secretions. The internal causes of disease depend\r\nalmost always on the superabundance or deterioration of the humours.\r\nGalen calls every disorder of the humours a putridity; it is due\r\nto a stagnant humour being exposed to a high temperature without\r\nevaporating. Thus suppuration and the sediment of urine are proofs of\r\nputridity. In every fever there is a kind of putridity which gives out\r\nan unnatural heat, which becomes the cause of fever, because the heart\r\nand the arterial system take part in it.\r\n\r\nChoulant enumerates eighty-three works of Galen which are acknowledged\r\nas genuine, nineteen which are doubtful, forty-five spurious, nineteen\r\nfragments; and fifteen commentaries on different books of Hippocrates;\r\nand more than fifty short pieces and fragments for the most part\r\nprobably spurious, which are still lying unpublished in the libraries\r\nof Europe. Besides these Galen wrote many other works, the titles\r\nof which only remain to us; so that it is estimated that altogether\r\nthe number of his different books cannot have been less than five\r\nhundred.[508] He wrote, not on medicine only, but on ethics, logic,\r\ngrammar, and other philosophical subjects; he was therefore amongst\r\nthe greatest and most voluminous authors that have ever lived.[509]\r\nHis style is elegant, but he is given to prolixity, and he abounds in\r\nquotations from the Greek writers.\r\n\r\nPHILIP OF CÆSAREA was a contemporary of Galen about the middle of the\r\nsecond century after Christ. He belonged to the sect of the Empirici,\r\nand defended their doctrines. It is probable that he wrote on marasmus,\r\non materia medica, and on catalepsy; but as there were other physicians\r\nof the same name, there is much uncertainty as to their identity.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Galen came the Gothic invasions over the civilized\r\nworld, and all but extinguished the learning of the times. Medicine\r\nlingered still in Rome, Constantinople, and Alexandria, but individuals\r\nrather than schools and sects kept it alive; it struggled to exist\r\namidst the grossest ignorance, superstition, and magical practices,\r\ntill it was re-invigorated by the Saracens.\r\n\r\nSaints COSMAS and DAMIAN (_circ._ 303) were brothers who studied the\r\nsciences in Syria, and became eminent for their skill in the practice\r\nof medicine. As they were Christians, and eager to spread the faith\r\nwhich they professed, they never took any fees, and thus came to be\r\ncalled by the Greeks _Anargyri_ (without fees). The two brothers\r\nsuffered martyrdom under the Diocletian persecution, and have ever\r\nsince been famous as workers of miracles of healing and patrons of\r\nmedical science. Their relics were everywhere honoured, and a church\r\nbuilt in Rome by St. Gregory the Great preserves them to this day.\r\n\r\nDr. Meryon points out[510] that Gregory the Great enunciated one\r\ngreat doctrine of homœopathy: “Mos medicinæ est ut aliquando similia\r\nsimilibus, aliquando contraria contrairiis curet. Nam sæpe calida\r\ncalidis, frigida frigidis, sæpe autem frigida calidis, calida frigidis\r\nsanare consuevit.”\r\n\r\nALEXANDER OF TRALLES, though one of the most eminent ancient\r\nphysicians, believed in charms and amulets. Here are a few specimens.\r\nFor a quotidian ague, “Gather an olive leaf before sunrise, write on\r\nit with common ink κα, ροι, α, and hang it round the neck” (xii. 7, p.\r\n339); for the gout, “Write on a thin plate of gold, during the waning\r\nof the moon, μεί, θρεύ, μόρ, φόρ, τεύξ, βαίν, χωώκ” (xi. l. p. 313). He\r\nexorcised the gout thus: “I adjure thee by the great name Ἰαὼ Σαβαώθ,”\r\nthat is, יְהֹוָה צְבָאוֹת and a little further on: “I adjure thee by\r\nthe holy names Ἰαὼ, Σαβαὼθ, Ἀδωναὶ, Ἐλωὶ,” that is אֲדֹנָי אֱלֹהָי\r\nיְהֹוָה צְבָאוֹת.[511]\r\n\r\nNeoplatonism had its influence on medicine. Plotinus (A.D. 205-270),\r\nits great father, said, when dying, “I am striving to bring the God\r\nwhich is in us into harmony with the God which is in the Universe.”\r\nThe early Christians began to tell the world that the God within the\r\nsoul of man and the God which is in the Universe are one and the same\r\nbeing, of absolute righteousness, power and love. Plotinus preached a\r\ngospel to the philosophic world; the first Christians preached theirs\r\nto every creature. Neoplatonism taught the world that spirit was meant\r\nto rule matter: it was not enough that the early Christian exhibited\r\nto mankind man transformed as the result of his intimate relationship\r\nto the Divine, the philosophic world demanded wonders, something\r\nabove nature, as a proof of the Divine character of the revelation;\r\nthen, as Kingsley explains,[512] we begin to enter “the fairy land of\r\necstasy, clairvoyance, insensibility to pain, cures produced by the\r\neffect of what we now call mesmerism. They are all there, these modern\r\npuzzles, in those old books of the long bygone seekers for wisdom.”\r\nThus mankind, for ever wandering in a circle, began by these ecstasies\r\nand cures to retrace its steps towards the ancient priestcraft. These\r\nwonders were nothing to the Egyptian, Babylonian, and Jewish sorcerers;\r\nthey had traded in them for ages.\r\n\r\nANTYLLUS (_circ._ 300 A.D.) is mentioned by Oribasius, and is said by\r\nHäser to have been one of the greatest of the world’s surgeons; for\r\naneurism he tied the artery above and below the sac, and evacuated its\r\ncontents; for cataract, and for the cure of stammering, he invented\r\nappropriate treatment; and he employed something very much like\r\ntenotomy for contractures. He is the earliest writer whose directions\r\nare extant for performing the operation of tracheotomy. He must have\r\nbeen a man of great talent and originality. He practised the removal of\r\nglandular swellings of the neck and ligatured vessels before dividing\r\nthem, giving directions for avoiding the carotid artery and the jugular\r\nvein. It is a striking proof of the high state which surgery had\r\nreached at this period that bones were resected with freedom; the long\r\nbones, the lower jaw, and the upper jaw were dealt with in a manner\r\ngenerally considered to be brilliant examples of modern surgery.\r\n\r\nORIBASIUS (A.D. 326-403) was born at Pergamos. By command of the\r\nEmperor Julian the Apostate he made a summary from the works of all\r\npreceding physicians who had written upon the Healing Art. Having made\r\na collection of some seventy medical treatises, he reduced them into\r\none, adding thereto the results of his own observations and experience.\r\nHe also wrote for his friend Eunapius two books on diseases and their\r\nremedies, besides treatises on anatomy and an epitome of the works of\r\nGalen.[513] He was called the Ape of Galen, and Freind says the title\r\nwas not undeserved. He wrote in Greek, and though a mere compiler was\r\ncapable of better things. His pharmacy was that of Dioscorides. He did\r\nsome original work, as he was the first to write a description of the\r\ndrum of the ear and the salivary glands. In his works also, we find the\r\nfirst description of the wonderful disease called lycanthropy, a form\r\nof melancholia, or insanity,[514] in which the affected persons believe\r\nthemselves to be transformed into wolves, leaving their homes at night,\r\nimitating the behaviour of those animals, and wandering amongst the\r\ntombs. His great work he entitled _Collecta Medicinalia_. When Julian\r\ndied, Oribasius fell into disgrace, and was banished. He bore his\r\nmisfortunes with great fortitude, and so gained the esteem and love of\r\nthe “barbarians” amongst whom he lived that he was almost adored as a\r\ngod. He was ultimately restored to his property and honour.\r\n\r\nJACOBUS PSYCHRISTUS lived in the time of Leo I. Thrax (A.D. 457-474),\r\nwas a very famous physician of Constantinople, who was called “the\r\nSaviour,” on account of his successful practice.\r\n\r\nADAMANTIUS OF ALEXANDRIA, an Iatrosophist, was a Jewish physician, who\r\nwas expelled, with his co-religionists, from Alexandria, A.D. 415. He\r\nembraced Christianity at Constantinople. He wrote on physiognomy.\r\n\r\nIatrosophista was the ancient title of one who both taught and\r\npractised medicine.\r\n\r\nArchiater (chief physician) was a medical title under the Roman Empire,\r\nmeaning “the chief of the physicians,” and not “physician to the\r\nprince,” as some have explained.[515]\r\n\r\nMELETIUS (4th cent. A.D.), a Christian monk, wrote on physiology and\r\nanatomy.\r\n\r\nNEMESIUS, Bishop of Emissa (near the end of the fourth century), wrote\r\na treatise on the _Nature of Man_, which is remarkable for a proof that\r\nthe good Churchman came very near to two discoveries which were made\r\nlong after his time. He says that the object of the bile is to help\r\ndigestion, to purify the blood, and impart heat to the body. Freind\r\nsays[516] that in this we have the foundation of that which Sylvius de\r\nla Boë with so much vanity boasted he had invented himself. He adds\r\nthat “if this theory be of any use in physic, Nemesius has a very good\r\ntitle to the discovery.”\r\n\r\nThe Bishop described the circulation of the blood in very plain terms\r\nconsidering the state of physiology at that time.\r\n\r\n“The motion of the pulse takes its rise from the heart, and chiefly\r\nfrom the left ventricle of it; the artery is, with great vehemence,\r\ndilated and contracted by a sort of constant harmony and order. While\r\nit is dilated it draws the thinner part of the blood from the next\r\nveins, the exhalation or vapour of which blood is made the aliment for\r\nthe vital spirit. But while it is contracted it exhales whatever fumes\r\nit has through the whole body and by secret passages. So that the heart\r\nthrows out whatever is fuliginous through the mouth and the nose by\r\nexpiration.”[517]\r\n\r\nLUCIUS wrote on pharmacy in the first century.\r\n\r\nMARCELLUS EMPIRICUS (4th cent.) wrote a work on pharmacy, in Latin,\r\nwhich contains many charms and absurdities.\r\n\r\nÆTIUS was a Greek medical writer, who probably was a Christian of the\r\nsixth century. He was a native of Amida in Mesopotamia, and studied\r\nmedicine at Alexandria. He wrote the _Sixteen Books on Medicine_, one\r\nof the most valuable medical treatises of antiquity; though containing\r\nlittle original matter, it includes numerous extracts from works which\r\nhave since perished.[518]\r\n\r\nMany of the opinions of Ætius on surgery are excellent; he recommended\r\nthe seton, and lithotomy for women. Bleeding arteries he treated by\r\ntwisting, as we do now, and by tying. He advised irrigation with cold\r\nwater in the treatment of wounds. In lithotomy he recommends that the\r\nknife should be guarded by a tube. He treated worms with pomegranate\r\nbark, as has been recently revived.[519] He was the first Greek medical\r\nwriter amongst the Christians who gives specimens of the spells and\r\ncharms so much used by the Egyptian Christians in surgical cases; thus,\r\nin case of a bone sticking in the throat, the physician was to cry out\r\nin a loud voice, “As Jesus Christ drew Lazarus from the grave, and\r\nJonah out of the whale, thus Blasius, the martyr and servant of God,\r\ncommands, ‘Bone, come up or go down!’”[520]\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nAt the time when the civilizations of Greece and Rome had reached\r\ntheir highest perfection, the poison of sensual indulgence, elevated\r\ninto a religion, had instilled itself into the whole social life of\r\nthe people: in every incident of life, in business, in pleasure, in\r\nliterature, in politics, in arms, in the theatres, in the streets,\r\nin the baths, at the games, in the decorations of his home, in the\r\nornaments and service of his table, in the very conditions of the\r\nweather and the physical phenomena of nature[521] it met the Roman,\r\nand tainted every action of his life. Archdeacon Farrar, in the first\r\nchapter of his _Early Days of Christianity_, draws an awful picture of\r\nthe corruption of the old world at the moment when it was confronted\r\nby Christianity. The parent had absolute power over the person of his\r\nchild, and could destroy its life at its pleasure. Unfortunate children\r\nwere exposed on the roadside or left to perish in the waters of the\r\nTiber. The slave was the mere chattel of his master, and Roman women\r\ntreated their servants with the utmost barbarity. Juvenal has painted\r\nfor us in terrible colours the vices and shameless conduct of the\r\nwomen, and the selfish luxury and degrading pleasures of the men; the\r\nnameless crime, which was the disgrace of Greek and Roman civilization,\r\nwas looked upon as merely a question of taste; and St. Paul, in the\r\nfirst chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, has recorded for all time\r\nwhat was the highest the most perfect civilization Paganism has ever\r\nproduced was able to effect for the moral condition of the people. To\r\nthe Roman and Greek world, saturated with the most perfect philosophy\r\nthe world has ever known, and adorned by the art which has ever since\r\nbeen the despair of its imitators, there presented itself the Catholic\r\nChurch, and before the sun’s embrace sublime\r\n\r\n                        “Night wist\r\n    Her work done, and betook herself in mist\r\n    To marsh and hollow, there to bide her time\r\n    Blindly in acquiescence.”[522]\r\n\r\nThe enemies of Christianity have affected to lament the effects\r\nproduced by the religion of Jesus on the art and science of the pagan\r\nworld; it has been said that the early Christians became so indifferent\r\nto the welfare of their bodies that they no longer sought medical aid\r\nwhen sick, but either resigned themselves to death or sought remedies\r\nin prayers. It is quite possible that, at the soul’s awakening at the\r\nfirst revelation of the infinite importance of the spiritual life, men\r\ndid somewhat neglect the ailments of the flesh and forget them in the\r\neffort to realize the things of the spirit. It is perfectly true that\r\nthe natural sciences were not likely to make much progress in such\r\na condition of things. But if Christians were careless of their own\r\nhealth, it is not less certain that they were intensely solicitous for\r\nthat of their poor and friendless neighbours. The peculiar constitution\r\nof the Roman Empire, which was but a military tyranny, greatly\r\ncontributed to its fall, and the collapse would have come earlier had\r\nit not been for Christianity. The Empire had very little cohesion; the\r\nChurch had a cohesive force, such as the world had never experienced\r\nbefore, and the Church availed herself of all the facilities which\r\nthe Empire possessed of keeping up, from centre to circumference, the\r\ncirculation of the spirit of solidarity which has ever animated the\r\nCatholic body. Of course there was little reason to expect the Church\r\nto be very favourably disposed towards the philosophies of old Greece\r\nand Rome; they had done little for the moral and social welfare of the\r\npeople, and the Church had a better system than these could exhibit:\r\nbut when St Augustine appeared, there was found a _modus vivendi_\r\nbetween the noblest Platonism and the purest and loftiest Christian\r\ntheology. He pointed the way towards a Christian science, and Europe\r\nultimately realized it. It was found in the Schoolmen. Modern science\r\nis the legitimate child of Scholasticism, though it is unsparing in its\r\nabuse of its parent.\r\n\r\nThe slave to the ancient Roman was simply a beast who was able to\r\nspeak. When such beasts became unprofitable, because through sickness\r\nor old age they could no longer work, they were frequently turned out\r\nto perish. Cato advised the agriculturists to sell their old and sick\r\nslaves when no longer able to work, just as he recommended them to\r\ndispose of worn-out and diseased cattle and worthless implements of\r\nhusbandry.[523]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Claudius caused slaves who were thus cruelly treated to\r\nbe proclaimed freemen. It was the merciful and charitable conduct of\r\nthe early Christians towards slaves, of whom such vast numbers helped\r\nto people the Roman Empire, that caused the doctrines of the Gospel\r\nto spread so rapidly throughout the Roman world. The slave found in\r\nthe Gospel of Christ the first system of religion and philosophy which\r\ntook any account of the poor, the helpless, and the slave; the rich and\r\ncultured saw in the teachings of the Church of Christ the only system\r\nwhich embraced mankind as a whole. Juvenal[524] has indicated for us\r\nthe value of a slave’s life in these times.\r\n\r\n    “Go, crucify that slave. For what offence?\r\n    Who the accuser? Where the evidence?\r\n    For when the life of man is in debate,\r\n    No time can be too long, no care too great.\r\n    Hear all, weigh all with caution, I advise.\r\n    ‘Thou sniveller! is a slave a man?’ she cries.\r\n    ‘He’s innocent! be’t so; ’tis my command,\r\n    My will; let that, sir, for a reason stand.’”\r\n\r\nAlthough there is evidence that hospitals for the reception and\r\ntreatment of sick and destitute persons were established in India in\r\nvery early times,[525] and though we know that these were attached to\r\nsome of the temples of ancient Greece, and the Romans had convalescent\r\ninstitutions for sick slaves and soldiers, it cannot be doubted that we\r\nowe to Christianity the hospital as it exists amongst us at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nChristianity taught the world not only that God is the Father of\r\nmankind, the pagan world already knew Him as Zeus pater, but that as\r\nHis children we are the brethren and sisters of each other. The Church\r\nin Rome, in the third century, says Eusebius,[526] supported “widows\r\nand impotent persons, about a thousand and fifty souls who were all\r\nrelieved through the grace and goodness of Almighty God.” St. Basil the\r\nGreat (A.D. 379) founded at Cæsarea a vast hospital, which Nazianzen\r\ncalls a new city, and was named after him Basiliades. The same author\r\nthought “it might deservedly be reckoned among the miracles of the\r\nworld, so numerous were the poor and sick that came thither, and so\r\nadmirable was the care and order with which they were served.”[527]\r\nIn this institution St. Gregory of Nazianzus said, “disease became a\r\nschool of wisdom, and misery was changed into happiness.”\r\n\r\nChastel relates that (A.D. 375) Edessa possessed a hospital with 300\r\nbeds, and there were many similar institutions in the East. St. Jerome\r\nsays that the widow Fabiola founded the first Christian infirmary in\r\nRome, at the end of the fourth century. St. Paula, a Roman widow, in\r\nwhose veins ran the blood of the Scipios, the Gracchi, and Paulus\r\nÆmilia, and of Agamemnon, was born in 347 A.D., and was one of the\r\nmany noble Christian women who devoted their wealth and their lives\r\nto the poor, the suffering, and the helpless, in the early days of\r\nChristianity. She distributed immense alms, and built a hospital on\r\nthe road to Jerusalem, and also a monastery for St. Jerome and his\r\nmonks, whom she maintained, besides three monasteries for women;[528]\r\nshe carried the sick to their beds in her arms, and with her own hands\r\nwashed their wounds, as St. Jerome tells us. In Italy, Gaul, and Spain,\r\nmany asylums for sick and poor persons were built and maintained. Nor\r\nwere their benefits confined to Christians; for Jews, slaves, and\r\nfreemen were welcomed to these temples of charity. It is impossible in\r\nthe limits of this work to trace fully the progress of the hospital\r\nmovement; enough has been said to prove, as Baas, the Agnostic\r\nhistorian of medicine, admits,[529] that “Hospitals proper, in our\r\nsense of the term, did not originate till Christian times.”\r\n\r\nWhen the plague raged at Alexandria, Eusebius tells us,[530] “Many\r\nof our brethren, by reason of their great love and brotherly charity,\r\nsparing not themselves, cleaved one to another, visited the sick\r\nwithout weariness or heed-taking, and attended upon them diligently,\r\ncured them in Christ, which cost them their lives, and being full of\r\nother men’s maladies, took the infection of their neighbours.” Such was\r\nthe initial impulse which Christian charity applied to the healing art;\r\ntrace we now its splendid results in mediæval times.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages almost all the monasteries and religious houses\r\nhad a hospital of one kind or another attached to them; they had not\r\nonly places of entertainment for pilgrims, but institutions for the\r\ntreatment and care of the sick and poor. This care of the diseased\r\nand helpless was not left to the civil administration alone, but\r\nformed part of the regular work of the Church of the middle ages,\r\nand by ancient regulation this was placed under the control of the\r\nBishops. The Council of Vienne ordained that if the administrators of\r\na hospital, lay or clerical, became relaxed in the exercise of their\r\ncharge, proceedings should be taken against them by the Bishops, who\r\nshould reform and restore the hospital of their own authority.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Trent granted to Bishops the power of visiting the\r\nhospitals. This connection between the hospitals and the ecclesiastical\r\npower was acknowledged by the Christian sovereigns of Europe from the\r\nearliest times. The Emperor Justinian, for example, gave authority\r\nover the hospitals to the Bishops; the property of the hospitals was\r\nconsidered as Church property, and thus was protected in troublous\r\ntimes by the sanctity of religion.[531]\r\n\r\nThe Council of Chalcedon placed such clergy as lived in establishments\r\nwhere orphans, the aged, and infirm were received and cared for under\r\nthe authority of the Bishops, and makes use of the expression that this\r\nregulation was according to ancient custom.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Council of Chalcedon a hospital (ξενοδοχεῖον) seems\r\nto have been a common adjunct of a church.[532] Originally appropriated\r\nto the reception of strangers, its use was afterwards extended to the\r\nrelief of the poor and also of the sick, as at Alexandria, where, in\r\nA.D. 399, we read that “the priest Isidore being four-score years old,\r\nwas at that time governor of the hospital.”[533]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the story of Hypatia at Alexandria, we learn that\r\nthe Parabolani was the name given to the clergy of the lowest order,\r\nwho were appointed to attend to the sick, particularly in contagious\r\ndisorders, from which circumstance, says Fleury,[534] their name was\r\nderived, because it signifies persons who expose themselves.\r\n\r\nMOSCHION DIORTHORTES (about the 6th cent.) was a specialist in diseases\r\nof women. He wrote a manual for midwives based on the work of Soranus.\r\nHis description of the uterus is similar to the treatise of that\r\nphysician. He refutes the opinion of the ancients on the situation of\r\nmale infants on the right, and of females on the left. He has well\r\nindicated the signs of imminent abortion. He made a great number of\r\nobservations on the physical education of children which must have been\r\nof great importance to his time. He justly explained the reason for the\r\ncessation of the catamenia after severe diseases: the system cannot\r\nafford the waste. He anticipated the modern discovery that sterility is\r\na disease common to women and men. He adhered to the principles of the\r\nMethodical school, and the doctrines of _strictum_ and _laxum_.[535]\r\n\r\nPAULUS ÆGINETA, one of the most famous of the Greek writers on\r\nmedicine, was born in the island of Ægina, probably in the latter\r\nhalf of the seventh century after Christ. He was an Iatrosophist,\r\nand a Periodeutes, or one who travelled about in the exercise of his\r\nprofession. He wrote several books on medicine, of which one has\r\ncome down to us, called _De re Medica Libri Septem_, or “Synopsis of\r\nMedicine in seven books.” Dr. Adams, in his translation of this famous\r\nwork for the Sydenham Society, gives us the original introduction to\r\nthe treatises of this physician, who informs us that:—\r\n\r\n“In the first book you will find everything that relates to hygiene,\r\nand to the preservation from, and correction of, distempers peculiar\r\nto the various ages, seasons, temperaments, and so forth; also the\r\npowers and use of the different articles of food, as is set forth\r\nin the chapter of contents. In the second is explained the whole\r\ndoctrine of fevers, an account of certain matters relating to them\r\nbeing premised, such as excrementitious discharges, critical days,\r\nand other appearances, and concluding with certain symptoms which\r\nare the concomitants of fevers. The third book relates to topical\r\naffections, beginning from the crown of the head, and descending down\r\nto the nails of the feet. The fourth book treats of those complaints\r\nwhich are external and exposed to view, and are not limited to one\r\npart of the body, but affect various parts. Also, of intestinal worms\r\nand dracunculi. The fifth treats of the wounds and bites of venomous\r\nanimals; also of the distemper called hydrophobia, and of persons\r\nbitten by dogs which are mad, and by those which are not mad; and\r\nalso of persons bitten by men. Afterwards it treats of deleterious\r\nsubstances, and of the preservatives from them. In the sixth book\r\nis contained everything relating to surgery, both what relates to\r\nthe fleshy parts, such as the extraction of weapons, and to the\r\nbones, which comprehends fractures and dislocations. In the seventh\r\nis contained an account of the properties of all medicines, first\r\nof the simple, then of the compound, particularly of those which I\r\nhave mentioned in the preceding six books, and more especially the\r\ngreater, and as it were, celebrated preparations; for I did not think\r\nit proper to treat of all these articles promiscuously, lest it should\r\noccasion confusion, but so that any person looking for one or more of\r\nthe distinguished preparations might easily find it. Towards the end\r\nare certain things connected with the composition of medicines, and\r\nof those articles which may be substituted for one another, the whole\r\nconcluding with an account of weights and measures.”\r\n\r\nThe most valuable and interesting part of this work is the sixth book.\r\nThe whole treatise is chiefly a compilation from the great physicians\r\nwho preceded Paulus, but the sixth book contains some original matter.\r\n\r\nThis great Byzantine physician must have possessed considerable skill\r\nin surgery. His famous treatise on midwifery is now lost; it procured\r\nfor him amongst the Arabs the title of “the Obstetrician,” and entitles\r\nhim to be called the first of the teachers of the accoucheur’s art.\r\nCelebrated equally in the Arabian and Western schools, he exercised an\r\nenormous influence in the development of the medical arts. Throughout\r\nthe Middle Ages he maintained his great popularity, and his surgical\r\nteaching was the basis of that of Abulcasis, which afforded to Europe\r\nin the Middle Ages her best surgical knowledge. He was the first writer\r\nwho took notice of the cathartic properties of rhubarb.[536]\r\n\r\nAfter the time of Paulus of Ægina the art of surgery slept for five\r\nhundred years; imitators of the ancient masters and compilers of their\r\nworks alone remained to prove that it was still alive, but no progress\r\nwas made. The religious orders employed the best methods they knew\r\nfor the relief of physical suffering, but naturally it was not their\r\nwork to perfect the healing art. In the Middle Ages, when so much\r\nof the medical and surgical practice was in the hands of the monks,\r\nparticularly of the Benedictine order, many abuses crept in; and at\r\nlast the practice of surgery by the clergy was forbidden in 1163 by the\r\nCouncil of Tours.\r\n\r\nThe office of royal physician in the Frankish court in the sixth\r\ncentury was not unattended with risk. When Austrigildis, wife of King\r\nGuntram, died of the pestilence in the year 580, she expressed in her\r\nlast moments a pious desire that her doctors, Nicolaus and Donatus,\r\nshould be put to death for not having saved her; and her husband,\r\nfeeling it incumbent upon him to carry out her wishes, had them duly\r\nexecuted.[537]\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\nBramhilla, surgeon to Francis II. of Austria, said that surgical\r\ninstruments were invented by Tubal Cain, because the Bible says he was\r\n“the instructor of every artificer in brass and iron.”\r\n\r\nThe saw is a tool of great antiquity. Pliny attributes its invention\r\nto Dædalus, or to his nephew Perdix, who was also called Talos; he was\r\nsupposed to have imitated it from the jaw of a serpent, with which he\r\nhad been able to cut a piece of wood. The invention of forceps was\r\nattributed to Vulcan and the Cyclopes. When used for extracting teeth,\r\nthe Greeks called them ὀδοντάγρα; for extracting arrow-heads and other\r\nweapons from the wounded in battle, the particular form employed was\r\ncalled ἀρδιοθήρα.\r\n\r\nIn the collection of domestic objects discovered by M. Petrie in the\r\nEgyptian ruins of Kahun, flint saws close upon 5,000 years old may be\r\nseen.[538]\r\n\r\nPincers and tweezers are made by the natives of Timor-laut from the\r\nbamboo; they are used for pulling out the hair from the face. The\r\nnatives of the Darling River, New South Wales, use fine bone needles\r\nfor boring through the septum of the nose.\r\n\r\nThe book on _Wounds of the Head_ is admitted by the best critics to\r\nbe a genuine work of Hippocrates. We find in that treatise that he\r\nused the trepan, as he speaks of a σμικρὸν τρύπανον, a _small trepan_.\r\nThere must also have been a larger one, a πρίων, or _saw_, which had a\r\nπερίοδος, or _circular_ motion, and which was probably the trephine,\r\nand a πρίων χαρακτός, or _jagged saw_, which is held to be the\r\n_trepan_; and he gives instructions to the operator to withdraw the\r\ninstrument frequently and cool both it and the bone with cold water,\r\nand to exercise all vigilance not to wound the living membrane.[539]\r\n\r\nSplints were used by the Greeks for fractured limbs; they were called\r\nνάρθηκας. Cutting for the stone is spoken of in the Ὅρκος, which is\r\nattributed to Hippocrates. Celsus describes lithotrity, or crushing\r\nthe stone by the instrument invented by Ammonios the λιθοτόμος, _i.e._\r\nlithotomist.\r\n\r\nAsclepiades practised tracheotomy. Many surgical instruments have been\r\ndiscovered in Herculaneum and Pompeii. There is a speculum vaginæ with\r\ntwo branches and a travelling yoke for them driven by a screw, and a\r\nspeculum ani opening by pressure on the handles; there is a forceps of\r\ncurious construction for removing pieces of bone from the surface of\r\nthe brain in cases of fracture of the skull. Mr. Cockayne says:[540]—\r\n\r\n“It has been specially considered by Prof. Benedetto Vulpes [1847], who\r\nthinks it may also have been intended to take up an artery. The Greeks,\r\nhe observes, as appears by an inscription dug up near Athens, were\r\nable to tie an artery in order to stop hæmorrhage, and words implying\r\nso much are found in a treatise of Archigenes (A.D. 100), existing in\r\nMS. in the Laurentian library at Florence, ‘_the vessels carrying_\r\n(blood) _towards the incision must be tied or sewed up_.’ Near the end\r\nof the sixteenth century a French surgeon was the first to recover the\r\nligature of the artery, and the instrument he used was very similar to\r\nthe forceps in the Museum at Naples.”\r\n\r\nA curious pair of forceps has also been found, without a parallel among\r\nmodern surgical instruments; the blades have a half turn, and the grip\r\nis toothed and spoon-shaped when closed. By construction it is suited\r\nfor introduction into some internal cavity, and for holding firm and\r\nfast some excrescence there. Professor Vulpes finds it well calculated\r\nfor dealing with the excrescences which grow upon the Schneiderian\r\nmembrane covering the nasal bones, or such as come on the periphery\r\nof the anus, or the orifice of the female urethra; especially such as\r\nhaving a large base cannot be tied.[541]\r\n\r\nThere is further an instrument for tapping the dropsical, described by\r\nCelsus[542] and Paulus Ægineta. It was somewhat altered in the middle\r\nof the seventeenth century by Petit.\r\n\r\nAn instrument suited to carry off the dropsical humours by a little at\r\na time on successive days, as Celsus and Paulus Ægineta recommended,\r\nhas also been dug up. Rust and hard earth, which cannot safely\r\nbe removed, have blocked up the canal of the relic, and rendered\r\nconclusions less certain.[543]\r\n\r\n“The probe, ‘specillum,’ μήλη, is reputed by Cicero to have been\r\ninvented by the Arcadian Apollo, who also was the first to bind up a\r\nwound. Seven varieties are figured in the work of Professor Vulpes in\r\none plate, with ends obtuse, spoon-shaped, flat and oval, flat and\r\nsquare, flat and divided. The catheter of the ancients is figured by\r\nthe same writer. It was furnished with a bit of wood to be drawn out by\r\na thread, to prevent the obstructive effects of capillary attraction,\r\nand to fetch the urine after it when withdrawn. It is of bronze, and\r\nelastic catheters seem to be of modern invention.” There are, or were\r\nin 1847, eighty-nine specimens of pincers in the Naples Museum.\r\n\r\nHooks, hamuli, cauterising instruments, a spatula, a silver lancet, a\r\nsmall spoon for examining a small quantity of blood after venesection.\r\nThere are cupping vessels of a somewhat spherical shape, from which air\r\nwas exhausted by burning a little tow. A fleam for bleeding horses just\r\nlike that used at the present time, a bent lever of steel for raising\r\nthe bones of the head in cases of depressed fracture. Professor Vulpes\r\ngives figures of eight steel or iron knives used for various surgical\r\npurposes, and of a small plate to be used as an actual cautery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n Fig. 1.

Stones, metals, bits of\r\nparchment, portions of the human body, as parings of the finger nails,\r\nmay constitute these charms. Substances like stones, gems, or parchment\r\nmay have certain words, letters, or signs inscribed upon them. In the\r\nEast amulets have from the earliest ages been associated with the\r\nbelief in evil spirits as the causes of diseases. A talisman may for\r\nour purpose be considered as the same thing as an amulet. In Scott’s\r\n_Tales of the Crusaders_, there is one of these charms which has the\r\npower of stopping blood and protecting the wearer from hydrophobia.\r\nCharms, enchantments, the ceremonial use of words as incantations,\r\nsongs, verses, etc., have all been used either with a view of causing,\r\npreventing, or curing diseases, and their use of course arose from\r\nthe belief of primitive, or savage man his present representative,\r\nthat our maladies have a supernatural origin. An amulet may consist\r\nmerely of a piece of string tied like a bracelet round the wrist, as\r\nin India, where such a charm is commonly worn by school children; it\r\nis a talisman against fever, which has been blessed by a Brahman, has\r\nbeen sold for a half-rupee, and is highly esteemed by the wearer. Our\r\nword carminative (a comforting medicine, like tincture of cardamoms)\r\nmeans really a charm medicine, and is derived from the Latin _carmen_,\r\na song-charm. This word enshrines the fact that magic and medicine were\r\nonce united. The charm, _i.e._ song, was a spell, whether of words,\r\nphiltres, or figures, as thus:—\r\n\r\n    “With the charmes that she saide,\r\n    A fire down fro’ the sky alight.”\r\n                                                              —_Gower._\r\n\r\nCharms, amulets, characts, talismans, and the like, are found amongst\r\nall peoples and in all times. They unite in one bond of superstitious\r\nbrotherhood the savage and the philosopher, the Sumatrans and the\r\nEgyptians, the Malay and the Jew, the Catholic and the Protestant. The\r\ncharm differs from the amulet merely in the fact that it need not be\r\nsuspended. “There is scarcely a disease,” says Pettigrew, “for which\r\na charm has not been given.”[544] And it is well to note that their\r\ngreatest effect is always produced on disorders of the nervous system,\r\nin which the imagination plays so important a part. Charms are also\r\nused to avert diseases and other evils; so that the man, sufficiently\r\nprotected as he supposes by these objects, not only will escape\r\nplague and pestilence, but will be invulnerable to bullet and sword.\r\nThe Sumatrans practise medicine chiefly by charms; when called in to\r\nprescribe, they generally ask for “something on account,” under the\r\npretext of purchasing the appropriate charm.[545]\r\n\r\nThe hoof of the elk is used by the Indians and Norwegians and other\r\nnorthern nations as a cure for epilepsy. The patient must apply it to\r\nhis heart, hold it in his left hand, and rub his ear with it.[546]\r\n\r\n“Medicine” amongst primitive folk is a synonym for fetich; anything\r\nwonderful, mysterious, or unaccountable, is called “medicine” by the\r\nNorth American Indians. The medicine-bag is a mystery bag, a charm.\r\nIn fetiches primitive man recognises something which has a power of\r\na sort he cannot understand straightway; therefore it becomes to him\r\na religious object. “Why are any herbs or roots magical?” asks Mr.\r\nLang; and he correctly answers the question, not by any far-fetched\r\nexplanations, but by the observation that herbs really do possess\r\nmedicinal properties (some of them indeed of extreme potency), and\r\nthe ignorant invariably confound medicine with magic.[547] On this\r\ntheory it is, of course, not necessary to swallow the medicine or\r\napply it as we apply lotions and liniments; it is enough to carry it\r\nabout as an amulet or charm, for it is the _life_ of the thing which\r\nis efficacious, the _spirit_, which resides in the outward form, which\r\npossesses the virtue, not the material object itself. Of course, it\r\nmay be necessary to take the charm internally; but then it is not the\r\nphysiological action which is looked for, but the magical. Dapper, in\r\nhis _Description of Africa_ (p. 621), tells of savages who wear roots\r\nround their necks as amulets when they sleep out; they chew the roots,\r\nand spit the juice round the camp to keep off the wild beasts. At\r\nother times they burn the roots, and blow the smoke about for the same\r\npurpose. The Korannas carry roots as charms against bullets and wild\r\nanimals. If successful in war, and obtaining much booty, they say, “We\r\nthank thee, our grandfather’s root, that thou hast given us cattle to\r\neat.”\r\n\r\nThe Bongoes and Niam-Niams have similar customs.[548]\r\n\r\nGeneral Forlong, referring to the serpent Buddhism of Kambodia, says,\r\nthat “Fetish worship was the first worship, and to a great extent is\r\nstill the _real_ faith of the great mass of the ignorant, especially\r\nabout these parts.”[549] “Probably one-quarter of the world yet\r\ndeifies, or at least reverences, sticks and stones, ram-horns and\r\ncharms.”[550]\r\n\r\nThe Abyssinians are sunk in the grossest superstition; their medical\r\npractice is, to a large extent, based on the use of amulets and charms.\r\nEven leprosy and syphilis are treated by these means, and eye diseases\r\nby spitting in the affected organs.[551]\r\n\r\n“Fetiches” are claws, fangs, roots, or stones, which the Africans\r\nbelieve to be inhabited by spirits, and so powerful for good or evil.\r\nThe word is derived from the Portuguese _feitiço_, a charm or amulet.\r\n\r\nThe Tibetans wear amulets upon their necks and arms; they contain\r\nnail-parings, teeth, or other reliques of some sainted Lama, with musk,\r\nwritten prayers, and other charms.[552]\r\n\r\nBarth, travelling in Africa, found an English letter which had not\r\nreached its destination, used as a charm by a native.[553]\r\n\r\nLeaving primitive folk and savage peoples, and turning to the great\r\ncivilized nations of the past, we find the Egyptians, the Chaldæans,\r\nAssyrians, and Babylonians not less addicted to the use of amulets,\r\ncharms, talismans, and philters than their untutored progenitors\r\n(assuming with the anthropologists that the savage of to-day\r\nrepresents the primitive people who must have preceded the founders of\r\ncivilization). The Magi, according to Pliny,[554] prescribed the herb\r\nfeverfew, the _Pyrethrum parthenium_, to be pulled from the ground with\r\nthe left hand, that the fevered patient’s name must be spoken forth,\r\nand that the herborist must not look behind him. He tells us also\r\nthat the Magi and the Pythagoreans ordered the _pseudo-anchusa_ to be\r\ngathered with the left hand, while the plucker uttered the name of the\r\nperson to be cured, and that it should be tied on him for the tertian\r\nfever.[555]\r\n\r\nOf the _aglaophotis_, by which some commentators understand the peony\r\n(_Pæonia officinalis_), and others the “Moly” of Homer, Pliny says,\r\n“by means of this plant, the Magi can summon the deities into their\r\npresence when they please.” Concerning the _achæmenis_, he says the\r\nroot of it, according to the Magian belief as expressed by Democritus,\r\nwhen taken in wine, torments the guilty to such a degree during the\r\nnight, by the various forms of avenging deities, as to extort from\r\nthem a confession of their crimes. He tells, amongst other marvels,\r\nof the adamantis, a plant found in Armenia, which, when presented to\r\na lion, will make the beast fall upon its back and drop its jaws.\r\nThe Magi said if any one swallowed the heart of a mole palpitating\r\nand fresh, he would at once become an expert diviner. An owl’s heart\r\nplaced on a woman’s left breast while she is asleep will make her tell\r\nall her secrets. For quartan fevers they recommended a kind of beetle\r\ntaken up with the left hand to be worn as an amulet.[556] The use of\r\nscarabs or beetles made of steatite, lapis-lazuli, cornelian, etc.,\r\nas amulets, dates from the most ancient periods of Egyptian history.\r\nIn the fourth Egyptian room of the British Museum there are specimens\r\nof scarabs, with the names of kings and queens dating B.C. 4400-250.\r\nThe objects are not in all cases as old as the dates of the sovereigns\r\nwhose names they bear. “The beetle was an emblem of the god Khepera,\r\nthe self-created, and the origin and source from whence sprang gods\r\nand men. Rā, the Sun-god, who rose again daily, was, according to\r\nan Egyptian myth, a form of Khepera; and the burial of scarabs with\r\nmummies probably had reference to the resurrection of the dead.”[557]\r\n\r\nSome large scarabs which were fastened on the breasts of mummies had\r\ninscriptions from the 30th chapter of the _Book of the Dead_. The\r\ndeceased person prays: “Let there be no obstruction to me in evidence;\r\nlet there be no obstacle on the part of the Powers; let there be no\r\nrepulse in the presence of the Guardian of the Scale.” Other amulets\r\nconsist of papyrus sceptres, buckles of Isis, hearts, fingers, etc., in\r\ngold and precious stones. They are laid between the bandages of mummies\r\nto guard the dead from evil.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lenormant explains the magical incantations which were used\r\nin connection with these talismans; they had to be “pronounced over the\r\nbeetle of hard stone, which is to be overlaid with gold and to take the\r\nplace of the individual’s heart. Make a phylactery of it anointed with\r\noil, and say magically over this object, ‘My heart is my mother; my\r\nheart is in my transformations.’”[558]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians were buried with their amulets as a protection\r\nagainst the evil powers of the other world. Mr. Flinders Petrie,\r\nexcavating at the Pyramid of Hawara, discovered on the body of Horuta a\r\ngreat number of these charms. He says: “Bit by bit the layers of pitch\r\nand cloth were loosened, and row after row of magnificent amulets were\r\ndisclosed, just as they were laid on in the distant past. The gold ring\r\non the finger which bore his name and titles, the exquisitely inlaid\r\ngold birds, the chased gold figures, the lazuli statuettes, delicately\r\nwrought, the polished lazuli and beryl, and carnelian amulets finely\r\nengraved, all the wealth of talismanic armoury, rewarded our eyes with\r\na sight which has never been surpassed to archæological gaze. No such\r\ncomplete and rich a series of amulets has been seen intact before.”[559]\r\n\r\nAnodyne necklaces, made of beads from peony roots, are worn by children\r\nin some parts to assist them in teething. The ancient Greeks held the\r\npeony in great repute; they believed it to be of divine origin, and\r\nit was for many centuries held to have the power to drive away evil\r\nspirits.[560]\r\n\r\nAbydemis, a Greek historian who wrote a history of Assyria, says that\r\nthe inhabitants made amulets from the wood of the ash, and hung them\r\nround their necks as a charm against sorcery.\r\n\r\nIn the Sanskrit Atharvaveda are found charms for diseases, which are\r\ninfluenced by colours. Saffron and the yellow-hammer are prescribed for\r\njaundice; red remedies, and especially red cows, for blood diseases.\r\n\r\nThe extremity of the intestine of the ossifrage, says Pliny, if worn as\r\nan amulet, is well known to be an excellent remedy for colic. Another\r\ncure is for the patient to drink the water in which he has washed his\r\nfeet![561] A tick from a dog’s left ear, worn as an amulet, will allay\r\nall kinds of pains, but we must be careful to take it from a dog that\r\nis black.[562]\r\n\r\n“Pliny says that any plant gathered from the bank of a brook or river\r\nbefore sunrise, provided that no one sees the person who gathers it, is\r\nconsidered as a remedy for tertian ague, when tied to the left arm, the\r\npatient not knowing what it is; also, that a person may be immediately\r\ncured of the headache by the application of any plant which has grown\r\non the head of a statue, provided it be folded in the shred of a\r\ngarment, and tied to the part affected with a red string.”[563]\r\n\r\nThe cyclamen was cultivated in houses as a protection against poison.\r\nPliny remarks that it was an amulet.[564] Vivisection was practised in\r\nconnection with charms. “If a man have a white spot, as cataract, in\r\nhis eye, catch a fox alive, cut his tongue out, let him go, dry his\r\ntongue and tie it up in a red rag and hang it round the man’s neck.”\r\n\r\nAlexander Trallianus was not able to rise above the absurdities of the\r\namulet. He recommends bits of old sailcloth from a shipwrecked vessel\r\nto be tied to the right arm and worn for seven weeks as a protection\r\nagainst epilepsy. He advises the heart of a lark to be fastened to the\r\nleft thigh as a remedy for colic; for a quartan ague, the patient must\r\ncarry about some hairs from a goat’s chin. He admits that he has no\r\nfaith in such things, but merely orders them as placebos for rich and\r\nfastidious patients who could not be persuaded to adopt a more rational\r\ntreatment.[565]\r\n\r\nDr. Baas tells us that “a regular pagan amulet was found in 1749 on\r\nthe breast of the prince bishop Anselm Franz of Würzburg, count of\r\nIngolstadt, after his death.”[566]\r\n\r\n\r\nGNOSTIC AND CHRISTIAN AMULETS.\r\n\r\nGnosticism is responsible for the introduction of many wonder-working\r\namulets and charms. This system of philosophy was a fantastical\r\ncombination of Orientalism, Greek philosophy, and Christianity. The\r\nteaching was that all natures were emanations of the Deity, or _Œons_.\r\nOn some of the gnostic amulets the word _Mythras_ was inscribed, on\r\nothers _Serapis_, _Iao_, _Sabaoth_, _Adonai_, etc.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that the spirit of Christianity in its\r\nearly days was strenuously opposed to all magical and superstitious\r\npractices, the nations it subdued to the faith of Christ were so wedded\r\nto their ancient practices that they could not be entirely divorced\r\nfrom them, and thus in the case of amulets and charms it was necessary\r\nto substitute Christian words and emblems in place of the heathen words\r\nand symbols previously in use.\r\n\r\nAnglo-Saxon charms and amulets were used by the monks of Glastonbury\r\nAbbey, who treated disease. In the “Leech book”[567] we find a holy\r\namulet “against every evil rune lay,[568] and one full of elvish\r\ntricks, writ _for the bewitched man_, this writing in Greek letters:\r\nAlfa, Omega, IESVM, BERONIKH. Again, another dust and drink against a\r\nrune lay; take a bramble apple,[569] and lupins, and pulegium, pound\r\nthem, then sift them, put them in a pouch, lay them under the altar,\r\nsing nine masses over them, put the dust into milk, drip thrice some\r\nholy water upon them, administer _this_ to drink at three hours.... If\r\na mare[570] or hag ride a man, take lupins, and garlic, and betony, and\r\nfrankincense, bind them on a fawn skin, let a man have the worts on\r\nhim, and let him go into his house.” For typhus fever the patient is to\r\ndrink of a decoction of herbs over which many masses have been sung,\r\nthen say the names of the four gospellers and a charm and a prayer.\r\nAgain, a man is to write in silence a charm, and silently put the words\r\nin his left breast and take care not to go indoors with the writing\r\nupon him, the words being EMMANUEL, VERONICA.\r\n\r\nMr. Cockayne, the editor of _Saxon Leechdoms_, has pointed out that the\r\ngreatest scientific men of antiquity, even those who set themselves\r\nagainst the prevailing medical superstitions of their times, and did\r\ntheir utmost to establish observation and experiment in opposition to\r\nspeculation and old wives’ fables, were by no means liberated from a\r\nbelief in magic and incantations. Chrysippus believed in amulets for\r\nquartan fevers.[571] Serapion, one of the chiefs of the Empiric school,\r\nprescribed crocodile’s dung and turtle’s blood in epilepsy. Soranos\r\nwill not use incantations in the cure of diseases, yet he testifies\r\nthat they were so employed. Pliny has an amulet for almost every\r\ndisorder. He tells of a chief man in Spain who was cured of a disease\r\nby hanging purslane root round his neck; he teaches that an amulet of\r\nthe seed of tribulus cures varicose veins; that the longest tooth of a\r\nblack dog cures quartan fevers; or you may carry a wasp in your left\r\nhand or half a dozen other equally absurd things for the same purpose.\r\nA holly planted in the courtyard of a house keeps off witchcrafts; an\r\nherb picked from the head of a statue and tied with a red thread will\r\ncure headache, and so on.[572]\r\n\r\nJosephus tells a tale which was probably the foundation of what was\r\nafterwards told about the mandrake. Xenocrates had a fancy for advising\r\npeople to eat human brains, flesh or liver, or to swallow for various\r\ncomplaints the ground bones of parts of the human frame. Alexander of\r\nTralles says that even Galen did homage to incantations.[573] He gives\r\nhis words: “Some think that incantations are like old wives’ tales;\r\nas I did for a long while. But at last I was convinced that there is\r\nvirtue in them by plain proofs before my eyes. For I had trial of\r\ntheir beneficial operations in the case of those scorpion-stung, nor\r\nless in the case of bones stuck fast in the throat, immediately, by\r\nan incantation thrown up. And many of them are excellent, severally,\r\nand they reach their mark.” Yet Galen is angry with Pamphilos for “his\r\nbabbling incantations,” which were “not merely useless, not merely\r\nunprofessional, but all false: no good even to little boys, not to say\r\nstudents of medicine.”[574]\r\n\r\nAlexander of Tralles frequently prescribes amulets and the like. Mr.\r\nCockayne calls them periapts. “Thus for colic, he guarantees by his\r\nown experience, and the approval of almost all the best doctors, dung\r\nof a wolf, with bits of bone in it if possible, shut up in a pipe, and\r\nworn during the paroxysm, on the right arm, or thigh, or hip, taking\r\ncare it touches neither the earth nor a bath. A lark eaten is good. The\r\nThracians pick out its heart, while alive, and make a periapt, wearing\r\nit on the left thigh. A part of the cæcum of a pig prepared with myrrh,\r\nand put in a wolf’s or dog’s skin, is a good thing to wear. A ring with\r\nHercules strangling a lion on the Median stone[575] is good to wear.\r\n\r\n“A bit of a child’s navel, shut up in something of gold or silver\r\nwith salt, is a periapt which will make the patient at ease entirely.\r\nHave the setting of an iron ring octagonal, and engrave upon it,\r\n‘Flee, Flee, Ho, Ho, Bile, the lark was searching’; on the head of the\r\nring have an N[576] engraved; this is potent, and he thinks it must\r\nbe strange not to communicate so powerful an antidote, but begs it\r\nmay be reserved from carnal folk, and told only to such as can keep\r\nsecrets and are trusty. For the gout he recommends a certain cloth—ἐκ\r\nτῶν καταμηνίων; also the sinews of a vulture’s leg and toes tied on,\r\nminding that the right goes to the right, the left to the left; also\r\nthe astragali of a hare, leaving the poor creature alive; also the\r\nskin of a seal for soles; also a line of Homer, τετρήχει δ'ἀγορή, ὑπὸ\r\nδὲ στοναχίζετο γαῖα, on gold-leaf, when the moon is in Libra; also a\r\nnatural magnet found when the moon is in Leo. Write on gold-leaf, in\r\nthe wane of the moon, ‘mei, threu, mor, for, teux, za, zon, the, lou,\r\nchri, ge, ze, ou, as the sun is consolidated in these names, and is\r\nrenewed every day; so consolidate this plaster as it was before, now,\r\nnow, quick, quick, for, behold, I pronounce the great name, in which\r\nare consolidated things in repose, iaz, azuf, zuon, threux, bain,\r\nchook; consolidate this plaster as it was at first, now, now, quick,\r\nquick.’[577]\r\n\r\n“Then bits were to be chopped off a chameleon, and the creature living\r\nwas to be wrapped up in a clean linen rag, and buried towards the\r\nsunrise, while the chopped bits were to be worn in tubes; all to be\r\ndone when the moon was in the wane. Then again for gout, some henbane,\r\nwhen the moon is in Aquarius or Pisces, before sunset, must be dug up\r\nwith the thumb and third finger of the left hand, and must be said, I\r\ndeclare, I declare, holy wort, to thee; I invite thee to-morrow to the\r\nhouse of Fileas, to stop the rheum of the feet of M. or N., and say I\r\ninvoke thee, the great name, Jehovah, Sabaoth, the God who steadied the\r\nearth and stayed the sea, the filler of flowing rivers, who dried up\r\nLot’s wife and made her a pillar of salt, take the breath of thy mother\r\nearth and her power, and dry the rheum of the feet or hands of M. or N.\r\nThe next day, before sunrise, take a bone of some dead animal, and dig\r\nthe root up with this bone, and say, I invoke thee by the holy names,\r\nIao, Sabaoth, Adonai, Elai; and put on the root one handful of salt,\r\nsaying, ‘As this salt will not increase, so may not the disorder of\r\nN. or M.’ And hang the end of the root as a periapt on the sufferer,”\r\netc.[578]\r\n\r\nAlthough Alexander of Tralles was an enlightened and skilful physician,\r\nhe recommended for epilepsy a metal cross tied to the arm; and went to\r\nthe Magi for assistance in his art, and was recommended to use jasper\r\nand coral with root of nux vomica tied in a linen cloth as an amulet.\r\nIt seems strange that, although Hippocrates and the scepticism of the\r\nEpicureans had apparently destroyed the faith in magicians amongst the\r\nlearned, that men should have so soon reverted to the absurdities from\r\nwhich they had been delivered; but there is an element in our nature\r\nwhich can only be satisfied by that which magic represents, and even in\r\nthe present age of science we have reverted to the same things under\r\nthe names of Spiritualism, Theosophy, and Occultism.\r\n\r\nIt would be grossly unfair to the Catholic Church to complain of\r\nthe slavery in which it kept the minds of the ignorant barbarians\r\nwhom it had converted from paganism to Christianity. When we read of\r\nmedicine masses, of herbs and decoctions placed under the altar, of\r\nholy water mixed with drugs, and the sign of the cross made over the\r\npoultices and lotions prescribed, we are apt to say that the priests\r\nmerely substituted one form of superstition for another, which was a\r\nlittle coarser. A little reflection will serve to dispel this idea. A\r\nbelief in magic influence is, as we have abundantly shown, inseparable\r\nfrom the minds of primitive and savage man. It is as certain that\r\na savage will worship his fetish, pray to his idol, and believe in\r\ndisease-demons, and their expulsion by charms and talismans, as that\r\nhe will tattoo or paint his body, stick feathers in his hair, and\r\nrings in his nose and ears; it is part of the evolution of man on his\r\nway to civilization. To suddenly deprive a savage or barbarian of\r\nall his magic remedies, his amulets and charms, would be as foolish\r\nas it would be futile: foolish, because many amulets and charms are\r\nperfectly harmless, and help to quiet and soothe the patient’s mind;\r\nfutile, because whatever the ecclesiastical prohibition, the obnoxious\r\nceremonies would certainly be practised in secret. It was therefore\r\nwiser for the Church to compromise the matter, to wink at innocent\r\nsuperstitions, and endeavour to substitute a religious idea such as the\r\nsign of the cross would imply, for the meaningless, if not idolatrous,\r\nceremonies of a pagan religion. Let us never forget that the Church\r\ndelivered the nations from “the tyranny and terror of the poisoner and\r\nthe wizard.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBS, ANIMALS, ETC., AS AMULETS.\r\n\r\nBurton, in his _Anatomy of Melancholy_, mentions several “amulets\r\nand things to be borne about” as remedies for head-melancholy, such\r\nas hypericon, or St. John’s wort, gathered on a Friday in the hour\r\nof Jupiter, “borne or hung about the neck, it mightily helps this\r\naffection, and drives away all fantastical spirits.” A sheep or kid’s\r\nskin whom a wolf worried must not be worn about a man, because it is\r\napt to cause palpitation of the heart, “not for any fear, but a secret\r\nvirtue which amulets have.” “Peony doth cure epilepsy, precious stones\r\nmost diseases; a wolf’s dung borne with one helps the colic; a spider\r\nan ague, etc. Being in the country,” he says, “in the vacation time,\r\nnot many years since, at Lindley, in Leicestershire, my father’s home,\r\nI first observed this amulet of a spider in a nut-shell lapped in silk,\r\netc., so applied for an ague by my mother; whom, although I knew to\r\nhave excellent skill in chirurgery, sore eyes, aches, etc., and such\r\nexperimental medicines, as all the country where she dwelt can witness,\r\nto have done many famous and good cures upon diverse poor folks that\r\nwere otherwise destitute of help; yet among all other experiments,\r\nthis, methought, was most absurd and ridiculous; I could see no warrant\r\nfor it—_Quid aranea cum febre?_ For what antipathy?—till at length\r\nrambling amongst authors (as I often do), I found this very medicine in\r\nDioscorides, approved by Matthiolus, repeated by Alderovandus, _cap.\r\nde aranea, lib. de insectis_, and began to have a better opinion of\r\nit, and to give more credit to amulets, when I saw it in some parties\r\nanswer to experience.”[579]\r\n\r\nThe common fumitory (_Fumaria capreolata_) is said to derive its name\r\nfrom _fumus_, smoke, “because the smoke of this plant was said by the\r\nancient exorcists to have the power of expelling evil spirits.”[580]\r\n\r\nThe elder had many singular virtues attributed to it; if a boy were\r\nbeaten with an elder stick, it hindered his growth; but an elder on\r\nwhich the sun had never shined was an amulet against erysipelas.[581]\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOTS AS CHARMS.\r\n\r\nMarcellus, a medical writer, quoted by Mr. Cockayne in his preface\r\nto _Saxon Leechdoms_, vol. i, p. xxix., gives an example of knots as\r\ncharms. “As soon as a man gets pain in his eyes, tie in unwrought flax\r\nas many knots as there are letters in his name, pronouncing them as you\r\ngo, and tie it round his neck.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS STONES AS CHARMS.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the superstitious belief in the magic power of precious\r\nstones has always been traced to Chaldæa. Pliny[582] refers to a\r\nbook on the subject which was written by Lachalios, of Babylon, and\r\ndedicated to Mithridates.\r\n\r\nThe Eagle stone (_Ætites_) is a natural concretion, a variety of\r\nargillaceous oxide of iron, often hollow within, with a loose kernel\r\nin the centre, found sometimes in an eagle’s nest. This was a famous\r\namulet, bringing love between a man and his wife; and if tied to the\r\nleft arm or side of a pregnant woman it ensured that she should not\r\nbe delivered before her time. Women in labour were supposed to be\r\nquickly delivered if they were girded with the skin which a snake casts\r\noff.[583]\r\n\r\nThe Bezoar stone had a great reputation in melancholic affections.\r\nManardus says it removes sadness and makes him merry that useth it.[584]\r\n\r\n“Of the stone which hight agate. It is said that it hath eight virtues.\r\nOne is when there is thunder, it doth not scathe the man who hath this\r\nstone with him. Another virtue is, on whatsoever house it is, therein\r\na fiend may not be. The third virtue is, that no venom may scathe the\r\nman who hath the stone with him. The fourth virtue is, that the man,\r\nwho hath on him secretly the loathly fiend, if he taketh in liquid\r\nany portion of the shavings of this stone, then soon is exhibited\r\nmanifestly in him, that which before lay secretly hid. The fifth virtue\r\nis, he who is afflicted with any disease, if he taketh the stone in\r\nliquid, it is soon well with him. The sixth virtue is, that sorcery\r\nhurteth not the man who has the stone with him. The seventh virtue is,\r\nthat he who taketh the stone in drink, will have so much the smoother\r\nbody. The eighth virtue of the stone is, that no bite of any kind of\r\nsnake may scathe him who tasteth the stone in liquid.”[585]\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNATURES.\r\n\r\nColours have always had a medical significance, from their connection\r\nwith the doctrine of “signatures.” White was cooling; red was hot.\r\nRed flowers were given in disorders of the blood; yellow in bile\r\ndisturbance. The bed-hangings in small-pox and scarlet-fever cases\r\nwere commonly of a red colour; the unhappy patient’s room was hung\r\nabout with red drapery. He had to drink infusions of red berries,\r\nsuch as mulberries. Avicenna said that as red bodies move the blood\r\neverything of a red colour is good for blood disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBERS.\r\n\r\nMagic numbers as charms were in use in Anglo-Saxon medicine. “If any\r\nthing to cause annoyance get into a man’s eye, with five fingers of the\r\nsame side as the eye, run the eye over and fumble at it, saying three\r\ntimes, ‘tetunc resonco, bregan gresso,’ and spit thrice. For the same,\r\nshut the vexed eye and say thrice, ‘in mon deromarcos axatison,’ and\r\nspit thrice; this remedy is ‘mirificum.’ For the same, shut the other\r\neye, touch gently the vexed eye with the ring finger and thumb, and\r\nsay thrice, ‘I buss the gorgon’s mouth.’ This charm repeated thrice\r\nnine times will draw a bone stuck in a man’s throat. For hordeolum,\r\nwhich is a sore place in the eyelid of the shape of a barley-corn,\r\ntake nine grains of barley and with each poke the sore, with every\r\none saying the magic words, κυρια κυρια κασσαρια σουρωφβι; then throw\r\naway the nine, and do the same with seven; throw away the seven, and\r\ndo the same with five, and so with three and one. For the same, take\r\nnine grains of barley and poke the sore, and at every poke say, ‘φεῦγε,\r\nφεῦγε κριθή σε διώκει, _flee, flee, barley thee chaseth_.’ For the\r\nsame, touch the sore with the medicinal or ring finger, and say thrice,\r\n‘vigaria gasaria.’ To shorten the matter, blood may be stanched by the\r\nwords, ‘sicycuma, cucuma, ucuma, cuma, uma, ma, a.’ Also by ‘Stupid\r\non a mountain went, stupid, stupid was;’ by socnon socnon; σοκσοκαμ\r\nσυκιμα; by ψα ψε ψη ψε ψη ψα ψε. For toothache say, ‘Argidam margidam\r\nsturgidam;’ also, spit in a frog’s mouth, and request him to make\r\noff with the toothache. For a troublesome uvula catch a spider, say\r\nsuitable words, and make a phylactery of it. For a quinsy lay hold of\r\nthe throat with the thumb and the ring and middle fingers, cocking up\r\nthe other two, and tell it to be gone.”\r\n\r\nNine is the number consecrated by Buddhism, three is sacred among\r\nBrahminical and Christian people. Pythagoras held that the unit or\r\nmonad is the principle and the end of all. One is a good principle.\r\nTwo, or the dyad, is the origin of contrasts and separation, and is an\r\nevil principle. Three, or the triad, is the image of the attributes\r\nof God. Four, or the tetrad, is the most perfect of numbers and the\r\nroot of all things. It is holy by nature. Five, or the pentad, is\r\neverything; it stops the power of poisons, and is redoubted by evil\r\nspirits. Six is a fortunate number. Seven is powerful for good or evil,\r\nand is a sacred number. Eight is the first cube, so is man four-square\r\nor perfect. Nine, as the multiple of three, is sacred. Ten, or the\r\ndecad, is the measure of all it contains, all the numeric relations and\r\nharmonies.[586]\r\n\r\nCornelius Agrippa wrote on the power of numbers, which he declares\r\nis asserted by nature herself; thus the herb called cinquefoil, or\r\nfive-leaved grass, resists poison, and bans devils by virtue of the\r\nnumber five; one leaf of it taken in wine twice a day cures the\r\nquotidian, three the tertian, four the quartan fever. He believed that\r\nevery seventh son born to parents who have not had daughters is able to\r\ncure the king’s-evil by touch or word alone.[587]\r\n\r\n\r\nGIRDLES.\r\n\r\nAmongst the ancient Britons, says Meryon,[588] when a birth was\r\nattended with difficulty or danger, girdles were put round the woman,\r\nwhich were made for the purpose, and which gave her immediate relief.\r\nMany families in the highlands of Scotland kept such girdles until\r\nquite recently. They were marked with cabalistic figures, and were\r\napplied with certain ceremonies, which came originally from the Druids.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPITTLE.\r\n\r\nLevinus Lemnius says of saliva: “Divers experiments show what power\r\nand quality there is in man’s fasting spittle, when he hath neither\r\neat nor drunk before the use of it; for it cures all tetters, itch,\r\nscabs, pushes, and creeping sores; and if venomous little beasts have\r\nfastened on any part of the body, as hornets, beetles, toads, spiders,\r\nand such like, that by their venome cause tumours and great pains and\r\ninflammations; do but rub the places with fasting spittle, and all\r\nthose effects will be gone and dismissed.”[589]\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Browne is not quite sure that fasting saliva really is\r\npoisonous to snakes and vipers.[590]\r\n\r\nIn _Saxon Leechdoms_ a cure for the gout runs thus: “Before getting out\r\nof bed in the morning, spit on your hand, rub all your sinews, and say,\r\n‘Flee, gout, flee, etc.’”[591]\r\n\r\nSpittle was anciently a charm against all kinds of fascination. Pliny\r\nsays it averted witchcraft. Theocritus says,—\r\n\r\n    “Thrice on my breast I spit, to guard me safe\r\n    From fascinating charms.”\r\n\r\nFishermen and costermongers often spit on the first money they take,\r\nfor good luck.[592]\r\n\r\n\r\nTALISMANS.\r\n\r\nTalismans, says Fosbrooke,[593] are of five classes, 1. The\r\n_Astronomical_, with celestial signs and intelligible characters.\r\n2. The _Magical_, with extraordinary figures, superstitious words,\r\nand names of unknown angels. 3. The _Mixed_, of celestial signs and\r\nbarbarous words, but not superstitions, or with names of angels. 4.\r\nThe _Sigilla Planetarum_, composed of Hebrew numeral letters, used by\r\nastrologers and fortune tellers. 5. _Hebrew Names and Characters._\r\nThese were formed according to the cabalistic art. Pettigrew gives\r\na Hebrew talisman,[594] which runs thus: “It overflowed—he did cast\r\ndarts—Shaddai is all sufficient—his hand is strong, and is the\r\npreserver of my life in all its variations.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRIPTS.\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock says that “The use of writing as a medicine prevails\r\nlargely in Africa, where the priests or wizards write a prayer on a\r\npiece of board, wash it off, and make the patient drink it. Caillie\r\nmet with a man who had a great reputation for sanctity, and who made\r\nhis living by writing prayers on a board, washing them off, and then\r\nselling the water, which was sprinkled over various objects and\r\nsupposed to protect them.”[595]\r\n\r\nMungo Park relates similar facts.[596]\r\n\r\nSir A. Lyall says that a similar practice exists in India, where,\r\nhowever, the native practitioner may sometimes be seen mixing croton\r\noil in the ink with which he writes his charms. “In Africa,” says\r\nLubbock, “the prayers written as medicine or as amulets are generally\r\ntaken from the Koran.” It is admitted that they are no protection\r\nagainst firearms; but this does not the least weaken faith in them,\r\nbecause, as guns were not invented in Mahomet’s time, he naturally\r\nprovided no specific against them.[597]\r\n\r\nAmong the Kirghiz Atkinson says that the Mullas sell such amulets\r\nat the rate of a sheep for each scrap of written paper,[598] and\r\nsimilar charms are in great request among the Turkomans[599] and in\r\nAfghanistan.[600]\r\n\r\nThe very curious account of the trial of jealousy in Numbers vi. 11-31\r\nmay be studied in this connection as showing the extreme antiquity\r\nof the writing charm. In the case of the woman suspected of having\r\ncommitted adultery “the priest shall bring her near, and set her before\r\nthe Lord: and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel;\r\nand of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall\r\ntake, and put it into the water: and the priest shall set the woman\r\nbefore the Lord, and uncover the woman’s head, and put the offering of\r\nmemorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest\r\nshall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the\r\npriest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man\r\nhave lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness\r\nwith another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter\r\nwater that causeth the curse: but if thou hast gone aside to another\r\ninstead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain\r\nwith thee beside thine husband: then the priest shall charge the woman\r\nwith an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The\r\nLord make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the Lord doth\r\nmake thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell; and this water that\r\ncauseth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell,\r\nand thy thigh to rot: and the woman shall say, Amen, amen. And the\r\npriest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out\r\nwith the bitter water: and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter\r\nwater that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse\r\nshall enter into her, and become bitter. Then the priest shall take the\r\njealousy offering out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the offering\r\nbefore the Lord, and offer it upon the altar: and the priest shall\r\ntake an handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn\r\nit upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the\r\nwater. And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come\r\nto pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her\r\nhusband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her,\r\nand become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot:\r\nand the woman shall be a curse among her people. And if the woman be\r\nnot defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive\r\nseed. This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another\r\ninstead of her husband, and is defiled; or when the spirit of jealousy\r\ncometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the\r\nwoman before the Lord, and the priest shall execute upon her all this\r\nlaw. Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman\r\nshall bear her iniquity.”\r\n\r\nThis is quite evidently taken from the customs of African tribes. As\r\nthe Egyptians gave the Jews their knowledge of the medical arts, and as\r\nthis knowledge was doubtless largely intermingled with African ideas,\r\nit is easy to see how the ordeal of the bitter curse-water found its\r\nway into the Mosaic ritual.\r\n\r\nOf scripts as amulets we find that anything written in a character\r\nwhich nobody could read was worn as an amulet against disease or\r\ndanger. Thus the Anglo-Saxon MS., known as the Vercelli MS., by some\r\nmeans found its way to a place near Milan, where no one could decipher\r\nit. When that discovery was made, the next step was to cut up its\r\nprecious pages for amulets, and so many of its leaves have perished.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Pascal, the philosopher, a writing was found sewn\r\ninto his doublet. This was a “profession of faith” which he wore as a\r\nsort of amulet or charm, and his servants believed that he always had\r\nit stitched into a new garment when he discarded the old one.[601]\r\n\r\n“Mais ce qui montre que ce n’est par un simple engagement tel qu’on\r\nen peut prendre avec soi-même, c’est la forme étrange que Pascal\r\nlui a donnée. Pour quiconque a vu les écrits de ce genre de la part\r\nd’hallucinés, le premier coup d’œil montre que l’écrit de Pascal\r\nappartient à cette catégorie. D’ailleurs, il porte l’énonciation\r\nmanifeste d’une vision en ces termes: ‘Depuis environ dix heures et\r\ndemie du soir jusque environ minuit et demi, feu.’ Ainsi, ce jour-là,\r\nle lundi 23 Novembre, 1654, pendant environ deux heures, Pascal eut\r\nla vision d’un feu qu’il prit pour une apparition surnaturelle, et sa\r\nconviction fut si forte qu’elle le détermina à entrer plus avant qu’il\r\nn’avait fait jusqu’alors dans les voies de la dévotion et du rigorisme\r\njanséniste.”[602]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTS.\r\n\r\nOf the species of charms known as characts we have many examples in the\r\npractice of Anglo-Saxon physicians. In the preface to the _Herbarium\r\nof Apuleius_, used at Glastonbury, Mr. Cockayne, the editor, gives the\r\nfollowing from Marcellus, 380 A.D., to avoid inflamed eyes: “Write on\r\na clean sheet of ουβαικ, and hang this round the patient’s neck, with\r\na thread from the loom.” In a state of purity and chastity write on\r\na clean sheet of paper φυρφαραν, and hang it round the man’s neck;\r\nit will stop the approach of inflammation. The following will stop\r\ninflammation coming on, written on a clean sheet of paper: ρουβος,\r\nρνονειρας ρηελιος ως· καντεφορα· και παντες ηακοτει; it must be hung\r\nto the neck by a thread; and if both the patient and operator are in a\r\nstate of chastity, it will stop inveterate inflammation. Again, write\r\non a thin plate of gold with a needle of copper, ορνω ουρωδη; do this\r\non a Monday; observe chastity; it will long and much avail.\r\n\r\n_Characts_ are amulets in the form of inscriptions, and are to be found\r\nin all the old houses still existing in Edinburgh.[603] The name of God\r\nis one of the commonest characts.\r\n\r\nRabbi Hama gives a sacred seal with divine names written in Hebrew,\r\nwhich he declares will cure not only all kinds of diseases, but heal\r\nall griefs whatsoever. The seals are figured in Morley’s _Life of\r\nCornelius Agrippa_.[604]\r\n\r\nWhen a charact or charm lost its original meaning, it came to bear that\r\nof something worn for its supposed efficacy in preserving the wearer\r\nfrom danger in mind or body, and now means a mere trinket to hang on a\r\nwatch chain. One of the most famous of ancient charms was the name of\r\nthe supreme deity of the Assyrians. This was the Abracadabra, which was\r\nsupposed to have a magical efficacy as an antidote against ague, fever,\r\nflux, and toothache.[605] It was written on parchment, and arranged as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n                         A B R A C A D A B R A\r\n                          A B R A C A D A B R\r\n                           A B R A C A D A B\r\n                            A B R A C A D A\r\n                             A B R A C A D\r\n                              A B R A C A\r\n                               A B R A C\r\n                                A B R A\r\n                                 A B R\r\n                                  A B\r\n                                   A\r\n\r\nThis was suspended round the neck by a linen thread. The word Abraxas,\r\nor Abrasax, was engraved on antique stones, and used as amulets or\r\ncharms against disease. Sometimes mystical characters and figures were\r\nadded, as the head of a fowl, the arms and bust of a man terminating\r\nin the body and tail of a serpent. It is of Egyptian origin, and is\r\nreferred to by the Greek Fathers. The Egyptians used it to dispossess\r\nevil spirits and to cure diseases.[606]\r\n\r\nAbraxas is the president of the 365th heaven, and is thus evidently a\r\nsun myth. Apollo is the sun in mythology, and he was the god of physic\r\nor healing.[607]\r\n\r\nBrande, in his _Popular Antiquities_, gives the following charm from a\r\nmanuscript of the date of 1475:[608]—\r\n\r\n“Here ys a charme for wyked Wych. In nomine Patris, et Filii, et\r\nSpiritus Sancti. Amen. Per Virtutem Domini sint Medicina mei pia Crux ✠\r\net passio Christi ✠. Vulnera quinque Domini sint Medicina mei ✠. Virgo\r\nMaria mihi succurre, et defende ab omni maligno Demonio, et ab omni\r\nmaligno Spiritu. Amen. ✠ a ✠ g ✠ l ✠ a ✠ Tetragrammaton. ✠ Alpha, ✠ oo,\r\n✠ primogenitus, ✠ vita, vita. ✠ Sapiencia, ✠ Virtus, ✠ Jesus Nazarenus\r\nrex judeorum, ✠ fili Domini, miserere mei.

They said that He had gained admission to the Holy\r\nof Holies, where He learned the sacred mystery, wrote it on a tablet,\r\ncut open His thigh, and having put the tablet in the wound, closed the\r\nflesh by uttering the mystic Name. The names of angels and evil spirits\r\nwere also held to be potent by the Cabalists. The name of a bad angel,\r\nSchabriri, was used when written down as a charm to cure ophthalmia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOLEN PROPERTY AS A CHARM.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Andrew Lang’s delightful _Custom and Myth_ he says that he once\r\nmet at dinner a lady who carried a _stolen_ potato about with her as a\r\ncure for rheumatism. The potato must be stolen, or the charm would not\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nA small piece of beef, if _stolen_ from a butcher, is supposed by some\r\npersons to charm away warts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK IV.\r\n\r\n              _CELTIC, TEUTONIC, AND MEDIÆVAL MEDICINE._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMEDICINE OF THE DRUIDS, TEUTONS, ANGLO-SAXONS, AND WELSH.\r\n\r\n Origin of the Druid Religion.—Druid Medicine.—Their Magic.—Teutonic\r\n Medicine.—Gods of Healing.—Elves.—The Elements.—Anglo-Saxon\r\n Leechcraft.—The Leech-book.—Monastic Leechdoms.—Superstitions.—Welsh\r\n Medicine.—The Triads.—Welsh Druidism.—The Laws of the Court\r\n Physicians.—Welsh Medical Maxims.—Welsh Medical and Surgical Practice\r\n and Fees.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICINE OF THE DRUIDS.\r\n\r\nThe learned men of the Celto-Britannic regions were called Druids. They\r\nwere the judges, legislators, priests, and physicians, and corresponded\r\nto the Magi of the ancient Persians and Chaldæans of Syria. The\r\netymology of the name is uncertain. The old derivation from δρῦς, an\r\noak, is considered fanciful, and that from the Irish _draoi_, _druidh_\r\n= a magician, an augur, is by some authorities preferred. It is\r\nprobable that they derived their knowledge from association with Greek\r\ncolonists of Marseilles, as such writing as they used was in Greek\r\ncharacters, and they taught the doctrine of the immortality of the\r\nsoul and a philosophy which Diodorus Siculus says was similar to that\r\nof the teaching of Pythagoras. Clement of Alexandria compared their\r\nreligion to Shamanism. Whatever it was, it did not differ probably very\r\nwidely from other systems which pretended to put its priests in direct\r\ncommunication with gods and demons. Its priests, says Sprengel, were\r\nsimply impostors who pretended to exclusive knowledge of medicine and\r\nother sciences. Their women practised sorcery and divination, but by\r\ntheir medical skill were able to afford great assistance to the wounded\r\nin war. Plants were collected and magical properties ascribed to them.\r\nLying-in women sought the aid of these Druidesses, who seem to have\r\nbeen wise women, somewhat after the character of gypsies. Mela says\r\nthese women were called Senæ. They pretended to cure the most incurable\r\ndiseases and to raise tempests by their incantations.[611] The Druids\r\ncommunicated their knowledge to initiates only, and they celebrated\r\ntheir mystic rites under groves of oaks. Whatever grew on that tree was\r\nconsidered a divine gift; their highest veneration was reserved for\r\nthe mistletoe, which they called All-Heal, and which they considered a\r\npanacea for all diseases. Three other plants, called _Selago_, a kind\r\nof club-moss, or perhaps hedge-hyssop, _Samulus_, the brookweed or\r\nwinter cress, and Vervain, were held to be sacred plants. The mistletoe\r\nmust be gathered fasting, the gatherer must not look backward while\r\ndoing it, and he must take it with his left hand. The branches and\r\nherbs were immersed in water, and the infusion then became possessed\r\nof the property of preserving the drinkers from disease. When the\r\nSelago and Vervain were gathered, a white garment was worn, sacrifices\r\nof bread and wine were offered, and the gatherer, having covered his\r\nhand with the skirt of his robe, cut up the herbs with a hook made\r\nof a metal more precious than iron, placed it in a clean cloth, and\r\npreserved it as a charm against misfortunes and accidents.[612]\r\n\r\nStrutt says: “Faint is the light thrown upon the methods pursued by the\r\nDruids in preparing their medicines. Some few hints, it is true, we\r\nmeet with, of their extracting the juice of herbs, their bruising and\r\nsteeping them in water, infusing them in wine, boiling them and making\r\nfumes from them, and the like; it also appears that they were not\r\nignorant of making salves and ointments from vegetables.”[613]\r\n\r\nIn Britain the magical juggles, ceremonies, and rites were carried to\r\na greater excess than in any other Celtic nation. They made a great\r\nmystery of their learning, their seminaries were held in groves and\r\nforests and the caverns of the earth.[614] Strutt thinks that their\r\nalphabet was derived from the Greek merchants, who came frequently to\r\nthe island. Pliny says that the ancient Britons were much addicted to\r\nthe arts of divination.[615] Diodorus Siculus describes one of their\r\nmethods. “They take a man who is to be sacrificed and kill him with one\r\nstroke of a sword above the diaphragm; and by observing the posture in\r\nwhich he falls, his different convulsions, and the direction in which\r\nthe blood flows from his body, they form their predictions, according\r\nto certain rules which have been left them by their ancestors.”[616]\r\n\r\nStrutt says:[617] “The people were the more particularly inclined to\r\nmake application to them for relief, because they thought that all\r\ninternal diseases proceeded from the anger of the gods, and therefore\r\nnone could be so proper to make intercession for them as the priest of\r\nthose very deities from whom their afflictions came; for this cause\r\nalso they offered sacrifices when sick; and if dangerously ill, the\r\nbetter to prevail upon the gods to restore them to health, a man was\r\nslain and sacrificed upon their altars.” The custom of human sacrifices\r\ndoubtless afforded the Druids some knowledge of human anatomy. Their\r\nsurgery was of a simple but useful character, and had to do principally\r\nwith setting broken bones, reducing dislocations, and healing wounds;\r\nall this, of course, combined with magical ceremonies.[618]\r\n\r\nPliny refers to the magical practices of the Druids, and states\r\nthat the Emperor Tiberius put them down, “and all that tribe of\r\nwizards and physicians.”[619] He adds that they crossed the ocean and\r\n“penetrated to the void recesses of Nature,” as he calls Britannia.\r\nThere, he tells us, they still cultivated the magic art, and that with\r\nfascinations and ceremonials so august that Persia might almost seem\r\nto have communicated it direct to Britain. “The worship of the stars,\r\nlakes, forests, and rivers, the ceremonials used in cutting the plants\r\nSamiolus, Selago, and Mistletoe, and the virtues attributed to the\r\nadder’s egg,” are thought by Ajasson to indicate the connection between\r\nthe superstitions of ancient Britain and those of Persia.[620]\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICINE OF THE TEUTONS.\r\n\r\nThe Goths and other German peoples were from early times brought into\r\nrelationship with the Romans, and had acquired some of the advantages\r\nof their civilization.\r\n\r\nOriginally their medical notions were not dissimilar to those of other\r\nbarbaric nations. On the one hand, there was the belief in disease as\r\nthe manifestation of the anger of supernatural beings who could be\r\npropitiated by prayers and magic rites; while on the other, the use\r\nof medicinal plants and the ministrations of old women were not less\r\nprominent. Tacitus points out the important part played by the women in\r\nthe life of the Germans, and the good influence they exerted as nurses\r\nto the sick.\r\n\r\nThe Roman general Agricola, who was in Britain from A.D. 78-84, induced\r\nthe noblemen’s sons to learn the liberal sciences.[621] They must have\r\nacquired some knowledge of Greek and Roman medicine.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest ages, says Baas,[622] women only seem to have\r\npractised medicine among the Germans and Celts. Medicine was deemed a\r\nprofession unworthy of men, and it is not till the twelfth century that\r\nphysicians are spoken of. Probably old women or Druidesses in ancient\r\ntimes were the only doctors of these peoples. Puschmann says that the\r\nNorwegians had a number of highly paid doctors in the tenth century,\r\nand that already a medical tax existed.[623]\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Vikings wounds were well attended to, amputations\r\nperformed, and wooden legs were not uncommon. “Mention,” says\r\nPuschmann, “is also made of the operation called gastroraphy” (or\r\nsewing up a wound of the belly or some of its contents);[624] lithotomy\r\nwas performed successfully.\r\n\r\nWodan is the all-pervading creative and formative power who gives shape\r\nand beauty, wealth, prosperity, and all highest blessings to men.[625]\r\n\r\nEir was the goddess of physicians; Odin was a doctor; Brunhilda was a\r\ndoctoress.\r\n\r\nThe ancient German nations offered to the gods sacrifices of human\r\nfood, which they believed they enjoyed. These sacrifices were offered\r\nas thanksgivings or to appease their anger. When a famine or a\r\npestilence appeared amongst the people, they concluded that the gods\r\nwere angry, and they proceeded to propitiate them with gifts.[626]\r\n\r\nAnimal and especially human sacrifices had the most binding and atoning\r\npower.[627]\r\n\r\nThe Teutonic elves are good-natured, helpful beings. They fetch\r\ngoodwives, midwives, to assist she-dwarfs in labour, and have much\r\nknowledge of occult healing virtues in plants and stones.[628] But\r\nelves sometimes do mischief to men. Their touch and their breath may\r\nbring sickness or death on man and beast. Lamed cattle are said in\r\nNorway to be bewitched by them, and their avenging hand makes men silly\r\nor half-witted.[629]\r\n\r\nTeutonic peoples have always had great faith in the normal influence of\r\npure water.\r\n\r\nThe Germans believed in the magical properties of water hallowed at\r\nmidnight of the day of baptism. Such water they called _heilawâc_.\r\nThey believed it to have a wonderful power of healing diseases and\r\nwounds, and of never spoiling.[630] The salt which is added to holy\r\nwater in the church will account for its keeping properties. But it\r\nis in medicinal springs, such as are called Heilbrunn, Heilborn,\r\nHeiligenbrunnen, that Teutonic faith has always exhibited the\r\nstrongest devotion. Sacrifices, says Grimm, were offered at such\r\nsprings. When the Wetterau people begin a new jug of chalybeate water,\r\nthey always spill a few drops first on the ground. Grimm thinks this\r\nwas originally a libation to the fountain sprite.[631] The Christians\r\nreplaced water-sprites by saints.\r\n\r\nFire was regularly worshipped, and there are many superstitions\r\nstill existing which point to this phase of Teutonic religion. “The\r\nEsthonians throw gifts into fire, as well as into water. To pacify the\r\nflame they sacrifice a fowl to it.”[632] Sulphur has always had an\r\nevil reputation. Murrain amongst cattle could only be got rid of by a\r\nNeedfire. On the day appointed for banishing the pest, there must in no\r\nhouse be any flame left on the hearth, but a new fire must be kindled\r\nby friction after the manner of savages.[633]\r\n\r\nTeutonic children born with a caul about their head are believed to be\r\nlucky children. The membrane is carefully treasured, and sometimes worn\r\nround the babe as an amulet. The Icelanders imagine that the child’s\r\nguardian spirit resides in it; midwives are careful not to injure it,\r\nbut bury it under the threshold. If any one throws it away, he deprives\r\nthe child of its guardian spirit.[634]\r\n\r\n\r\nANGLO-SAXON MEDICINE.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to discover what was the state of learning existing\r\namongst the ancient Saxons before their conversion to Christianity. We\r\nknow that soon after this event schools were established in Kent, with\r\nsuch good results that Sigebert (A.D. 635) established seminaries on\r\nthe same plan in his own dominions. After this, as Bede informs us,\r\nthere flourished a great number of learned men.[635]\r\n\r\nTheodore, Archbishop of Canterbury, came over into Britain A.D. 669,\r\nand did much to improve the learning of the country. He was accompanied\r\nby many professors of science, one of whom, the monk Adrian, instructed\r\na great number of students in the sciences, especially teaching the\r\nart of medicine and establishing rules for preserving the health.[636]\r\nAldhelm, who according to Bede was a man of great erudition and was\r\n“wonderfully well acquainted with books,” very greatly contributed to\r\nthe spread of education.\r\n\r\nThe state of medicine in England in Anglo-Saxon times is said by\r\nStrutt[637] to have been very degraded. Medicine consisted chiefly\r\nof nostrums which had been handed down from one age to another, and\r\ntheir administration was usually accompanied with whimsical rites\r\nand ceremonies, to which the success was often in a great measure\r\nattributed. The most ignorant persons practised the profession, and\r\nparticularly old women, who were supposed to be the most expert and\r\nwere in high repute amongst the Anglo-Saxons. After the establishment\r\nof Christianity the clergy succeeded to the business carried on by\r\nthe ancient dames, and it must be admitted that the superstitious\r\nelement in their treatment of disease was not less prominent than in\r\nthat of their venerable predecessors. Bede says[638] that Theodore,\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, taught that “It is very dangerous to let\r\nblood on the fourth day of the moon, because both the light of the moon\r\nand the tides are upon the increase.” Before any medicine could be\r\nadministered, fortunate and unfortunate times, the changes of the moon\r\nand appearance of the planets, had to be considered.\r\n\r\nMany medicinal books were amongst those which Ælfred the Great caused\r\nto be translated into the Saxon tongue. Some of them were embellished\r\nwith illustrations of herbs, etc., so that about the tenth century some\r\nknowledge of medicine was diffused, and Strutt thinks there may have\r\nbeen persons whose only profession was medicine and surgery, besides\r\nthe ecclesiastics who practised these arts, before the close of the\r\nSaxon government.[639]\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxons, even after their conversion to Christianity,\r\nretained much of the superstition of their ancestors; they placed\r\nfaith in astrology, and had some acquaintance with astronomy, which\r\nthey obtained from the Romans, from whom they learned most of the arts\r\nand sciences. They had a good knowledge of botany, and their MS. were\r\nembellished with excellent drawings of the herbs and plants.[640]\r\n\r\nTheodore brought with him a large collection of books, and set up\r\nschools in Kent, where many students were instructed in the sciences\r\nand the knowledge and application of medicine and the rules for the\r\npreservation of the health.[641]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Oswald Cockayne has given us, in his translation of the Saxon\r\n_Leech Book_, a very curious and interesting citation from Helias,\r\nPatriarch of Jerusalem, who wrote to King Ælfred in answer to his\r\nrequest to be furnished with some good recipes from the Holy Land:\r\n\r\n“Patriarch Helias sends these to King Ælfred:[642]__\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“So much as may weigh a penny and a half, rub very small, then add\r\nthe white of an egg, and give it to the man to sip. It (_balsam_) is\r\nalso very good in this wise for cough and for carbuncle, apply this\r\nwort, soon shall the man be hole. This is smearing with balsam for\r\nall infirmities which are on a man’s body, against fever, and against\r\napparitions, and against all delusions. Similarly also petroleum is\r\ngood to drink simple for inward tenderness, and to smear on outwardly\r\non a winter’s day, since it hath very much heat; hence one shall drink\r\nit in winter; and it is good if for any one his speech faileth, then\r\nlet him take it, and make the mark of Christ under his tongue, and\r\nswallow a little of it. Also if a man become out of his wits, then\r\nlet him take part of it, and make Christ’s mark on every limb, except\r\nthe cross upon the forehead, that shall be of balsam, and the other\r\n_also_ on the top of the head. Triacle (θηριακόν) is a good drink for\r\nall inward tendernesses, and the man, who so behaveth himself as is\r\nhere said, he may much help himself. On the day on which he will drink\r\n_Triacle_, he shall fast until midday, and not let the wind blow on\r\nhim that day: then let him go to the bath, let him sit there till he\r\nsweat; then let him take a cup, and put a little warm water in it, then\r\nlet him take a little bit of the triacle, and mingle with the water,\r\nand drain through some thin raiment, then drink it, and let him then\r\ngo to his bed and wrap himself up warm, and so lie till he sweat well;\r\nthen let him arise and sit up and clothe himself, and then take his\r\nmeat at noon, and protect himself earnestly against the wind that day;\r\nthen, I believe to God, that it may help the man much. The white stone\r\nis powerful against stitch, and against flying venom, and against all\r\nstrange calamities; thou shalt shave it into water and drink a good\r\nmickle, and shave thereto a portion of the red earth, and the stones\r\nare all very good to drink of, against all strange uncouth things. When\r\nthe fire is struck out of the stone, it is good against lightenings\r\nand against thunders, and against delusion of every kind; and if a man\r\nin his way is gone astray, let him strike himself a spark before him.\r\nHe will soon be in the right way. All this Dominus Helias, Patriarch\r\nat Jerusalem, ordered _one_ to say to King Ælfred.” Mr. Cockayne tells\r\nus in his preface[643] that Helias sent Alfred “a recommendation\r\nof scammony, which is the juice of a Syrian convolvulus, of gutta\r\nammoniacum,[644] of spices, of gum dragon, of aloes, of galbanum, of\r\nbalsam, of petroleum, of the famous Greek compound preparation called\r\nθηριακή and of the magic virtues of alabaster. These drugs are good in\r\nthemselves, and such as a resident in Syria would naturally recommend\r\nto others.” This very singular and instructive fact concerning King\r\nÆlfred is one of the most interesting things in Mr. Cockayne’s valuable\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAs to the age of the MS., the translator sets it down about A.D.\r\n900. The sources of the information he ascribes to Oxa, Dun, and\r\nHelias; there is a mixture of the Hibernian and Scandinavian elements\r\nalso. Some of the prescriptions are traceable to Latin writers, and\r\nlarge extracts are made from the Greek physicians. Paulus Ægineta is\r\nresponsible for the long passage on hiccupings (or Hicket, as the\r\n_Leech Book_ calls the malady), as chapter xviii. is almost identical\r\nwith Paulus Ægin., lib. ii. sect. 57. Mr. Cockayne thinks that the\r\nnumber of passages the Saxon drew from the Greek would make perhaps\r\none-fourth of the first two books. Whether they came direct from the\r\nGreek manuscripts or at second hand as quotations, it is not possible\r\nto say. Quoting M. Brechillet Jourdain,[645] Mr. Cockayne says that it\r\nis shown that the wise men of the Middle Ages long before the invention\r\nof printing possessed Latin translations of Aristotle; there is every\r\nprobability, therefore, that they would be familiar with the works of\r\nthe Greek physicians. Some of them could translate Greek. If an Italian\r\nor Frenchman could acquire Greek and turn it into Latin, a Saxon might\r\ndo as much. Bede and his disciples could certainly have done so. Bede\r\nsays that Tobias, Bishop of Rochester, was as familiar with the Greek\r\nand Latin languages as with his own. “It appears, therefore,” concludes\r\nMr. Cockayne, “that the leeches of the Angles and Saxons had the\r\nmeans, by personal industry or by the aid of others, of arriving at a\r\ncompetent knowledge of the contents of the works of the Greek medical\r\nwriters. Here, in this volume, the results are visible. They keep, for\r\nthe most part, to the diagnosis and the theory; they go back in the\r\nprescriptions to the easier remedies; for whether in Galen or others,\r\nthere was a chapter on the εὐπόριστα, the ‘parabilia,’ the resources of\r\ncountry practitioners, and of course, even now, expensive medicines are\r\nnot prescribed for poor patients.”[646]\r\n\r\nIn the very valuable Saxon Leechdoms[647] we have an excellent account\r\nof the state of medicine as practised in England before the Norman\r\nConquest. The _Leech Book_ (Læce Boc)[648] is a treatise on medicine\r\nwhich probably belonged to the abbey of Glastonbury. The manuscript,\r\nthinks Mr. Cockayne, belonged to one Bald, a monk. The book, says the\r\neditor, is learned in a literary sense, but not in a professional, for\r\nit does not really advance man’s knowledge of disease or of cures. He\r\nmay have been a physician, he was certainly a lover of books—“nulla\r\nmihi tam cara est optima gaza quam cari libri.” The work seems to imply\r\nthat there was a school of medicine among the Saxons. In the first\r\nbook, p. 120, we read that “Oxa taught us this leechdom”; in the second\r\nbook, p. 293, we are told concerning a leechdom for lung disease that\r\n“Dun taught it”; again we find “some teach us.” So far as book learning\r\nwas concerned, there was certainly a sort of medical teaching. It was\r\nperhaps merely taken from the Greek by means of a Latin translation of\r\nTrallianus, Paulus of Ægina, and Philagrios. As examples of reasonable\r\ntreatment take that for hare-lip (or hair-lip as in the text): “Pound\r\nmastic very small, add the white of an egg, and mingle as thou dost\r\nvermilion, cut with a knife the false edges of the lip, sew fast with\r\nsilk, then smear without and within with the salve, ere the silk rot.\r\nIf it draw together, arrange it with the hand, anoint again soon.”[649]\r\n\r\nAgainst pediculi quicksilver and old butter are to be mingled together\r\nin a mortar, and the resulting salve to be applied to the body. This is\r\nprecisely the mercurial ointment of modern pharmacy used for the same\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nReligion, magic, and medicine were oddly mixed up by our Saxon\r\nforefathers. Thus the _Leech Book_ tells us[650] for the “dry” disease\r\nwe should “delve about sour ompre (i.e. _sorrel dock_), sing thrice\r\nthe Pater noster, jerk it up, then while thou sayest sed libera nos a\r\nmalo, take five slices of it and seven peppercorns, bray them together,\r\nand while thou be working it, sing twelve times the psalm Miserere\r\nmei, Deus, and Gloria in excelsis deo, and the Pater noster; then pour\r\nthe stuff all over with wine, when day and night divide, then drink\r\nthe dose and wrap thyself up warm.” Here is an exorcism for fever. “A\r\nman shall write this upon the sacramental paten, and wash it off into\r\nthe drink with holy water, and sing over it.... In the beginning, etc.\r\n(John i. 1). Then wash the writing with holy water off the dish into\r\nthe drink, then sing the Credo, and the Paternoster, and this lay,\r\nBeati immaculati, the psalm (cxix.), with the twelve prayer psalms,\r\nI adjure you, etc. And let each of the two[651] then sip thrice of\r\nthe water so prepared.”[652] The demon theory of disease was still\r\nin force; even at Glastonbury we find the following exorcism:[653]\r\n“For a fiend sick man, when a devil possesses the man or controls him\r\nfrom within with disease; a spew drink, lupin, bishopwort, henbane,\r\ncropleek; pound _these_ together, add ale for a liquid, let stand for\r\na night, add fifty libcorns (or _cathartic grains_), and holy water. A\r\ndrink for a fiend sick man, to be drunk out of church bell.”[654]\r\n\r\n“Githrife, cynoglossum, yarrow, lupin, betony, attorlothe, cassock,\r\nflower de luce, fennel, church lichen, lichen, of Christ’s mark or\r\ncrosse, lovage; work up the drink off clear ale, sing seven masses\r\nover the worts, add garlic and holy water, and drip the drink into\r\nevery drink which he will subsequently drink, and let him sing the\r\npsalm, Beati immaculati, and Exurgat, and Salvum me fac, Deus,[655]\r\nand then let him drink the drink out of a church bell, and let the\r\nmass priest after the drink sing this over him: Domine, sancte pater\r\nomnipotens.”[656] Again, “For the phrenzied; bishopwort, lupin,\r\nbonewort, everfern,[657] githrife, elecampane; when day and night\r\ndivide, then sing thou in the church litanies, that is, the names of\r\nthe hallows or saints, and the Paternoster; with the song go thou, that\r\nthou mayest be near the worts and go thrice about them, and when thou\r\ntakest them go again to church with the same song, and sing twelve\r\nmasses over them, and over all the drinks which belong to the disease,\r\nin honour of the twelve apostles.”[658]\r\n\r\nThe _Leech Book_ has “a salve against nocturnal goblin visitors,” a\r\nremedy “against a woman’s chatter,” which is to go to bed, having eaten\r\nonly a root of radish; “that day the chatter cannot harm thee.”[659]\r\nRed niolin, a plant which grows by running water, if put under the\r\nbolster, will prevent the devil from scathing a man within or without.\r\nThere is “a lithe drink against a devil and dementedness,” and a cure\r\nfor a man who is “overlooked.”\r\n\r\nIf the man’s face is turned toward the doctor when he enters the\r\nsick room, “then he may live; if his face be turned from thee, have\r\nthou nothing to do with him.” “In case a man be lunatic, take of a\r\nmere-swine or porpoise, work it into a whip, swinge the man therewith;\r\nsoon he will be well. Amen.”[660]\r\n\r\nA salve against temptation of the devil contains many herbs, must have\r\nnine masses said over it, and must be set under the altar for a while;\r\nthen it is very good for every temptation of the fiend, and for a man\r\nfull of elfin tricks, and for typhus fever.[661]\r\n\r\nCancer is to be cured with goat’s gall and honey. Our forefathers made\r\nvery light of such trifles as cancer and lunacy, it will be perceived.\r\nJoint pains (rheumatism) are cured by singing over them, “Malignus\r\nobligavit; angelus curavit; dominus salvavit,” and then spitting on the\r\njoints. “It will soon be well with him,” adds the Saxon leech, in his\r\nusual cheery manner.[662] Pepper is to be chewed for the toothache; “it\r\nwill soon be well with them.” Horrible applications of pepper, salt,\r\nand vinegar were recommended to be applied to sore eyes. If the eyes\r\nwere swollen, “take a live crab, put his eyes out, and put him alive\r\nagain into the water, and put the eyes on the neck of the man who hath\r\nneed; he will soon be well.”\r\n\r\nThere are light drinks “against the devil and want of memory,” “for a\r\nwild heart,” and “pain of the maw.” There is treatment for the bite of\r\n“a gangwayweaving spider,” and remedies in case a woman cannot “kindle\r\na child.” Neuralgia and megrims are not the new disorders they are\r\ngenerally supposed to be, as we find remedies “for headache, and for\r\nold headache, and for ache of half of the head.”\r\n\r\n“Poison” was lightly treated with holy water and herbs. Snake-bite was\r\ncured with ear-wax and a collect. For bite of an adder you said one\r\nword “Faul”; “it may not hurt him.” “Against bite of snake, if the man\r\nprocures and eateth rind which cometh out of paradise, no venom will\r\ndamage him. Then said he that wrote this book that the rind was hard\r\ngotten.” If, by chance, one drank a creeping thing in water, he was\r\nto cut into a sheep instantly and drink the sheep’s blood hot. Lest a\r\nman tire with much travelling over land, he must take mugwort and put\r\nit into his shoe, saying, as he pulls up the root, “I will take thee,\r\nartemisia, lest I be weary on the way;” and having taken it, he must\r\nsign it with the sign of the cross.\r\n\r\n“Over the whole face of Europe, while the old Hellenic school survived\r\nin Arabia, the next to hand resource became the established remedy, and\r\nthe searching incision of the practised anatomist was replaced by a\r\ndroning song.”[663]\r\n\r\nSuch medical learning as existed amongst the Angles, Saxons, and Goths\r\nwas found only in a corrupted state in the monasteries. As we have\r\nseen, the herbal remedies were, for the most, useless or worse, and\r\nthe treatment was so intermingled with magic ceremonies and religious\r\nsuperstitious uses, that Greek science, so far as it related to the\r\nhealing art, was all but smothered by absurdities.\r\n\r\n“The Saxon leeches were unable to use the catheter, the searching\r\nknife, and the lithotrite; they knew nothing of the Indian drugs, and\r\nwere almost wholly thrown back on the lancet wherewith to let blood,\r\nand the simples from the field and garden.”[664]\r\n\r\n“For a very old headache” one must “seek in the maw of young swallows\r\nfor some little stones, and mind that they touch neither earth, nor\r\nwater, nor other stones; look out three of them, put them on the man;\r\nhe will soon be well. They are good for head ache and for eye wark, and\r\nfor the fiend’s temptations, and for the night mare, and for knot, and\r\nfor fascination, and for evil enchantments by song.”[665]\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of a regular Anglo-Saxon prescription, take the\r\nfollowing, as given in the MS. Cott.: Vitellius; c. 3:—\r\n\r\nFor the foot-adle (the gout), “Take the herb datulus, or titulosa,\r\nwhich we call greater crauleac—tuberose isis. Take the heads of it\r\nand dry them very much, and take thereof a pennyweight and a half,\r\nand the pear tree and Roman bark, and cummin, and a fourth part of\r\nlaurel-berries, and of the other herbs half a pennyweight of each, and\r\nsix peppercorns, and grind all to dust, and put two egg-shells full of\r\nwine. This is true leechcraft. Give it the man till he be well.”\r\n\r\nVenesection was in use, but it must have often done more harm than\r\ngood, as its use was regulated, not so much by the necessities of the\r\ncase as by the season and courses of the moon. Bede gives a long list\r\nof times when bleeding was forbidden. In the Cottonian library there\r\nis a Saxon MS., which tells us that the second, third, fifth, sixth,\r\nninth, eleventh, fifteenth, seventeenth, and twentieth days of the\r\nmonth are bad for bleeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICINE OF THE WELSH.\r\n\r\nThe Welsh claim that medicine was practised as one of “the nine rural\r\narts,” by the ancient Cymry, before they became possessed of cities and\r\na sovereignty, that is, before the time of Prydain ab Ædd Mawr, that is\r\nto say, about a thousand years before the Christian era.[666]\r\n\r\nAs in other nations of antiquity, the practice of medicine was in\r\nthe hands of the priests, the GWYDDONIAID, or men of knowledge: they\r\nwere the depositaries of such wisdom as existed in the land, and they\r\npractised almost entirely by means of herbs. The science of plants was\r\none of the three sciences, the others being theology and astronomy.[667]\r\n\r\nIn the following Triad (one of the poetical histories of the Welsh\r\nbards) we learn that,—“The three pillars of knowledge, with which\r\nthe Gwyddoniaid were acquainted, and which they bore in memory from\r\nthe beginning: the first was a knowledge of Divine things, and of\r\nsuch matters as appertain to the worship of God and the homage due to\r\ngoodness; the second, a knowledge of the course of the stars, their\r\nnames and kinds, and the order of times; the third, a knowledge of the\r\nnames and use of the herbs of the field, and of their application in\r\npractice, in medicine, and in religious worship. These were preserved\r\nin the memorials of vocal song, and in the memorials of times, before\r\nthere were bards of degree and chair.”[668]\r\n\r\nThe Welsh do not appear to have had any gods of medicine or to have\r\npretended to derive their knowledge of the healing art from any\r\ndivinities. In the reign of Prydian the Gwyddoniaid were divided into\r\nthree orders, Bards, Druids, and Ovates. The Ovates occupied themselves\r\nespecially with the natural sciences. In the Laws of Dyvnwal Moelmud,\r\n“medicine, commerce, and navigation” were termed “the three civil\r\narts.”[669]\r\n\r\nThis legislator lived about the year 430 B.C., at which early period it\r\nwould seem that the art of medicine was encouraged and protected by the\r\nState.[670]\r\n\r\nAs Hippocrates lived 400 B.C., it has been thought possible that the\r\nBritish Ovates may have learned something of his teaching from the\r\nPhoceans, who traded between Marseilles and Britain. Later we have\r\nproof that the physicians of Myddvai held the Father of Medicine in\r\ngreat esteem.\r\n\r\nIt is customary amongst the English to ridicule the pretensions of\r\nthe Welsh to the high antiquity of their knowledge of the arts and\r\nsciences, but classical writers bear witness to the wisdom and learning\r\nof the Druids. Strabo speaks of their knowledge of physiology. Cicero\r\nwas acquainted with one of the Gallic Druids, who was called Divitiacus\r\nthe Æduan, and claimed to have a thorough knowledge of the laws of\r\nnature. Pliny mentions the plants used as medicines by the Druids, such\r\nas the mistletoe, called _Oll iach, omnia sanantem_, or “All heal,” the\r\nselago (_Lycopodium selago_, or Upright Fir Moss), and the Samolus or\r\nmarshwort (_Samolus valerandi_, or Water Pimpernel).[671]\r\n\r\nOne of the Medical Triads in the Llanover MS. is that by Taliesin; it\r\nruns thus:—\r\n\r\n“There are three intractable substantial organs: the liver, the kidney,\r\nand the heart.\r\n\r\n“There are three intractable membranes: the dura mater, the peritoneum,\r\nand the urinary bladder.\r\n\r\n“There are three tedious complaints: disease of the knee joint, disease\r\nof the substance of a rib, and phthysis; for when purulent matter has\r\nformed in one of these, it is not known when it will get well.”\r\n\r\nHowel Dda (or the good) in the year 930 A.D. compiled the following\r\nlaws of the Court Physician:—\r\n\r\n“Of the mediciner of the household, his office, his privilege, and his\r\nduty, this treats.\r\n\r\n1. The twelfth is the mediciner of the household.\r\n\r\n2. He is to have his land free: his horse in attendance: and his linen\r\nclothing from the queen, and his woollen clothing from the king.\r\n\r\n3. His seat in the hall within the palace is at the base of the pillar\r\nto which the screen is attached, near which the king sits.\r\n\r\n4. His lodging is with the chief of the household.\r\n\r\n5. His protection is, from the time the king shall command him to visit\r\na wounded or sick person, whether the person be in the palace or out of\r\nit, until he quit him, to convey away an offender.\r\n\r\n6. He is to administer medicine gratuitously to all within the palace,\r\nand to the chief of the household; and he is to have nothing from\r\nthem except their bloody clothes, unless it be for one of the three\r\ndangerous wounds, as mentioned before; these are a stroke on the head\r\nunto the brain; a stroke in the body unto the bowels; and the breaking\r\nof one of the four limbs; for every one of these three dangerous wounds\r\nthe mediciner is to have nine score pence and his food, or one pound\r\nwithout his food, and also the bloody clothes.\r\n\r\n7. The mediciner is to have, when he shall apply a tent, twenty-four\r\npence.\r\n\r\n8. For an application of red ointment, twelve pence.\r\n\r\n9. For an application of herbs to a swelling, four legal pence.\r\n\r\n10. For letting blood, fourpence.\r\n\r\n11. His food daily is worth one penny half-penny.\r\n\r\n12. His light every night is worth one legal penny.\r\n\r\n13. The worth of a medical man is one penny.\r\n\r\n14. The mediciner is to take an indemnification from the kindred of the\r\nwounded person, in case he die from the remedy he may use, and if he do\r\nnot take it, let him answer for the deed.\r\n\r\n15. He is to accompany the armies.\r\n\r\n16. He is never to leave the palace, but with the king’s permission.\r\n\r\n17. His saraad is six kine, and six score of silver, to be augmented.\r\n\r\n18. His worth is six score and six kine, to be augmented.”\r\n\r\nElsewhere we meet with the following particulars:—\r\n\r\n“Of the three conspicuous scars this is:\r\n\r\n“There are three conspicuous scars: one upon the face; another upon\r\nthe foot; and another upon the hand; thirty pence upon the foot;\r\nthree-score pence upon the hand; six-score pence on the face. Every\r\nunexposed scar, fourpence. The cranium, fourpence.”[672]\r\n\r\n“For every broken bone, twenty pence; unless there be a dispute as to\r\nits diminutiveness; and if there be a dispute as to the size, let the\r\nmediciner take a brass basin, and let him place his elbow upon the\r\nground, and his hand over the basin, and if its sound be heard, let\r\nfour legal pence be paid; and if it be not heard, nothing is due.”[673]\r\n\r\nThis singular test is explained in another passage, thus:—\r\n\r\n“Four curt pennies are to be paid to a person for every bone taken from\r\nthe upper part of the cranium, which shall sound on falling into a\r\ncopper basin.”[674]\r\n\r\nA very curious regulation was that if the physician got drunk and\r\nanybody insulted him, he could claim no recompense, because “he knew\r\nnot at what time the king might want his assistance.”\r\n\r\nThe physicians of Myddvai flourished in the time of Rhys Gryg in the\r\nearly part of the thirteenth century. His domestic physician was\r\nRhiwallon, who was assisted by his three sons Cadwgan, Gruffydd, and\r\nEinion. They lived at Myddvai, in the present county of Caermarthen. By\r\ncommand of the prince, these physicians made a collection of the most\r\nvaluable prescriptions for the treatment of the various diseases of\r\nthe human body. This collection was not reduced to writing previously,\r\nthough many of the recipes were no doubt in use some centuries before.\r\nThe original manuscript is in the British Museum, and there is a copy\r\nin Jesus College, Oxford, in the _Red Book_, which has been published\r\nwith an English translation by the Welsh MSS. Society.[675] The\r\ndescendants of this family of physicians continued to practise medicine\r\nwithout intermission until the middle of the last century. This most\r\ninteresting volume also contains a second portion, which purports to\r\nbe a compilation by Howel the physician, son of Rhys, son of Llewelyn,\r\nson of Philip the physician, a lineal descendant of Einion the son of\r\nRhiwallon. Some medical prescriptions assumed the form of proverbs such\r\nas the following:—\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL MAXIMS.\r\n\r\n(_From the Book of Iago ab Dewi._)\r\n\r\n“He who goes to sleep supperless will have no need of Rhiwallon of\r\nMyddvai.\r\n\r\nA supper of apples—breakfast of nuts.\r\n\r\nA cold mouth and warm feet will live long.\r\n\r\nTo the fish market in the morning, to the butcher’s shop in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nCold water and warm bread will make an unhealthy stomach.\r\n\r\nThe three qualities of water: it will produce no sickness, no debt, and\r\nno widowhood.\r\n\r\nTo eat eggs without salt will bring on sickness.\r\n\r\nIt is no insult to deprive an old man of his supper.\r\n\r\nAn eel in a pie, lampreys in salt.\r\n\r\nAn ague or fever at the fall of the leaf is always of long continuance,\r\nor else is fatal.\r\n\r\nA kid a month old—a lamb three months.\r\n\r\nDry feet, moist tongue.\r\n\r\nA salmon and a sermon in Lent.\r\n\r\nSupper will kill more than were ever cured by the physicians of Myddvai.\r\n\r\nA light dinner, a less supper, sound sleep, long life.\r\n\r\nDo not wish for milk after fish.\r\n\r\nTo sleep much is the health of youth, the sickness of old age.\r\n\r\nLong health in youth will shorten life.\r\n\r\nIt is more wholesome to smell warm bread than to eat it.\r\n\r\nA short sickness for the body, and short frost for the earth, will\r\nheal; either of them long will destroy.\r\n\r\nWhilst the urine is clear, let the physician beg.\r\n\r\nBetter is appetite than gluttony.\r\n\r\nEnough of bread, little of drink.\r\n\r\nThe bread of yesterday, the meat of to-day, and the wine of last year\r\nwill produce health.\r\n\r\nQuench thy thirst where the washerwoman goes for water.\r\n\r\nThree men that are long-lived: the ploughman of dry land, a mountain\r\ndairyman, and a fisherman of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe three feasts of health: milk, bread, and salt.\r\n\r\nThe three medicines of the physicians of Myddvai: water, honey, and\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nModerate exercise is health.\r\n\r\nThree moderations will produce long life; in food, labour, and\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\nWhoso breaks not his fast in May, let him consider himself with the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nHe who sees fennel and gathers it not, is not a man, but a devil.\r\n\r\nIf thou desirest to die, eat cabbage in August.\r\n\r\nWhatever quantity thou eatest, drink thrice.\r\n\r\nGod will send food to washed hands.\r\n\r\nDrink water like an ox, and wine like a king.\r\n\r\nOne egg is economy, two is gentility, three is greediness, and the\r\nfourth is wastefulness.\r\n\r\nIf persons knew how good a hen is in January, none would be left on the\r\nroost.\r\n\r\nThe cheese of sheep, the milk of goats, and the butter of cows are the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nThe three victuals of health: honey, butter, and milk.\r\n\r\nThe three victuals of sickness: flesh meat, ale, and vinegar.\r\n\r\nTake not thy coat off before Ascension day.\r\n\r\nIf thou wilt become unwell, wash thy head and go to sleep.\r\n\r\nIn pottage without herbs there is neither goodness nor nourishment.\r\n\r\nIf thou wilt die, eat roast mutton and sleep soon after it.\r\n\r\nIf thou wilt eat a bad thing, eat roast hare.\r\n\r\nMustard after food.\r\n\r\nHe who cleans his teeth with the point of his knife may soon clean them\r\nwith the haft.\r\n\r\nA dry cough is the trumpet of death.”\r\n\r\nOne of the laws of Howel Dda permitted divorce for so trifling a cause\r\nas an unsavoury or disagreeable breath.[676]\r\n\r\nPoppies bruised in wine were used to induce sleep. For agues the\r\ntreatment was to write in three apples on three separate days an\r\ninvocation to the Trinity; “on the third day he will recover.” Saffron\r\nwas used for many complaints; it is a drug still largely used by the\r\npoor, who have unbounded faith in it, but it is almost inert. If a\r\nperson lost his reason, he was ordered to take primrose juice, “and he\r\nwill indeed recover.” There were regular tables of lucky and unlucky\r\ndays for bleeding. Fennel juice was supposed to act as a sort of\r\nanti-fat, and the roots of thistles were given as a purgative. If a\r\nsnake should crawl into a man’s mouth, the patient was to take camomile\r\npowder in wine. An irritable man was to drink celery juice; “it will\r\nproduce joy.” As we might have expected, the leek was supposed to have\r\nmany virtues; wives who desired children were told to eat leeks. Leek\r\njuice and woman’s milk was good for whooping cough. The juice was also\r\nused for deafness, heart-burn, headache, and boils. Mustard purifies\r\nthe brain, is an antidote to the bite of an adder, is good for colic,\r\nloss of hair, palsy, and many other things. To ascertain the fate of\r\na sick person, bruise violets and apply them to the eyebrows; “if he\r\nsleep, he will live, but if not he will die.”\r\n\r\nRadishes were supposed to prevent hydrophobia. “That is the greatest\r\nremedy, to remove a bone from the brain (to trephine) with safety.”\r\nDittany was the antidote for pain. Mouse-dung was used as a remedy for\r\nspitting of blood, and a plaster of cow-dung for gout. An eye-water\r\nwas made from rotten apples. The berries of mistletoe were made\r\ninto a confection as a remedy for epilepsy. “Let the sick person\r\neat a good mouthful (they gave large doses in those days) thereof,\r\nfasting morning, noon, and night. It is proven.” Sage was supposed to\r\nstrengthen the nerves (nerves in those days!). Nettles, goose-grass,\r\nblessed-thistle, and rosemary were favourite remedies. Then we have\r\nnumerous curious charms and “medical feats discovered through the\r\ngrace of God.” Here is one: “Take a frog alive from the water, extract\r\nhis tongue (frogs have long been subject to vivisection), and put him\r\nagain in the water. Lay this same tongue upon the heart of sleeping\r\nman, and he will confess his deeds in his sleep.” A charm for the\r\ntoothache runs thus: “Saint Mary sat on a stone, the stone being near\r\nher hermitage, when the Holy Ghost came to her, she being sad. Why art\r\nthou sad, mother of my Lord, and what pain tormenteth thee? My teeth\r\nare painful, a worm called megrim has penetrated them, and I have\r\nmasticated and swallowed it. I adjure thee, daffin O negrbina, by the\r\nFather, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, the Virgin Mary, and God, the\r\nmunificent physician, that thou dost not permit any disease, dolour,\r\nor molestation to affect this servant of God here present, either in\r\ntooth, eye, head, or in the whole of her teeth together. So be it.\r\nAmen.”\r\n\r\nAll the herbs and plants (so far as was possible) which were used in\r\nthe doctor’s practice were directed to be grown by him in his garden\r\nand orchard, so that they might be at hand when required.\r\n\r\nIn the table of weights and measures used by the ancient Welsh\r\nphysicians, we learn that twenty grains of wheat make one scruple, four\r\npodfuls make one spoonful, four spoonfuls make one eggshellful, four\r\neggshellfuls make one cupful. The physician also for his guidance had\r\nthe following curious table:—Four grains of wheat = one pea, four peas\r\n= one acorn, four acorns = one pigeon’s egg, four pigeon’s eggs = one\r\nhen’s egg, four hen’s eggs = one goose’s egg, four goose’s eggs = one\r\nswan’s egg.\r\n\r\n“For treating a stroke on the head unto the brain, a stroke in the body\r\nunto the bowels, and the breaking of one of the four limbs, the wounded\r\nperson was to receive three pounds from the one who wounded him; and\r\nthat person had also to pay for the medical treatment of the sufferer a\r\npound without food, or nine-score pence with his food, and the bloody\r\nclothes.”[677]\r\n\r\nThe physicians of Myddvai recognised five kinds of fevers; viz.,\r\nlatent, intermittent, ephemeral, inflammatory, and typhus. The doctor’s\r\n“three master difficulties” were a wounded lung, a wounded mammary\r\ngland, and a wounded knee joint. “There are three bones which will\r\nnever unite when broken—a tooth, the knee pan, and the os frontis.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMOHAMMEDAN MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n Sources of Arabian Learning.—Influence of Greek and Hindu\r\n Literature.—The Nestorians.—Baghdad and its Colleges.—The Moors\r\n in Spain.—The Mosque Schools.—Arabian Inventions and Services to\r\n Literature.—The great Arab Physicians.—Serapion, Rhazes, Ali Abbas,\r\n Avicenna, Albucasis, and Averroes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of the incursions of the barbarians of the North, when\r\nSpain, the South of France, Italy, and North Africa, with their\r\nadjacent islands, were ravaged by these hordes, multitudes of those\r\nwho could escape so far found a refuge in the East; and there is good\r\nreason for supposing that by such means a vast store of the accumulated\r\nknowledge of civilized Europe found its way to Eastern lands. Science\r\nin its turn has come back to us through the Saracens, who afterwards\r\ninvaded Southern Europe.[678]\r\n\r\nIt is not correct to speak of the Arabians or the Saracens as the\r\nsource of the culture which is known as Arabian and Saracenic. The\r\nmagnificent civilization of the Greek world fell to pieces like a noble\r\nbut ruined temple, and its precious relics went to form a score of\r\nother civilizations which ultimately arose from its ruins. It was not\r\nthe Semitic peoples of Arabia which restored the philosophy and science\r\nof the decayed Græco-Roman world, it was the Persians, the Greeks of\r\nAsia Minor, the people of Alexandria, and the cultured Eastern nations,\r\ngenerally, which having been subdued by the Arabs, at once began to\r\nimpart to their conquerors the culture which they lacked. The ignorant\r\nfollowers of the Prophet who burned the Alexandrian Library knew not\r\nwhat they did; the time was to come when Greek culture was to reach\r\nthem partly from the city whose literary treasures they had destroyed,\r\nand partly through Syrian and Persian influences. By these roads came\r\nthe medical sciences to the Saracens. The second library of Alexandria,\r\nconsisting of 700,000 volumes, was destroyed by them, A.D. 642; but\r\nwe must conclude that many medical and other scientific works were\r\npreserved, as the Jews and the Nestorians (banished from Constantinople\r\nto Asia) first made the Arabians acquainted with Greek authors by\r\ntranslating them into Syriac, whence they were in turn translated into\r\nArabic. Justinian I. (A.D. 529) banished the Platonists of Athens, when\r\nChosröes I., surnamed Nushirwan, or “the generous mind,” one of the\r\ngreatest monarchs of Persia, hospitably received them at his court.\r\nHe caused the best Greek, Latin, and Indian works to be translated\r\ninto Persian, and valued Græco-Roman medical science so highly that he\r\noffered a suspension of hostilities for the single physician Tribunus.\r\n\r\nThe East in a great measure owed its acquaintance with the rich\r\ntreasures of Greek literature to the heresy of Nestorius. Nestorius\r\nwas a Syrian by birth, and became bishop of Constantinople. Having\r\ndenied that the Virgin Mary ought to be called “Mother of God,” he was\r\nsummoned to appear before the Council of Ephesus (A.D. 431), and was\r\ndeposed. Nestorian communities were formed, and the heretical opinions\r\nrapidly spread, patronized as they were for political purposes by the\r\nPersian kings. The Mahometan conquests in the seventh century, by\r\noverthrowing the supremacy of orthodoxy, afforded great encouragement\r\nto the Nestorians, as by denying that Mary was the mother of God, as\r\nthe Catholics maintained, the Nestorians in calling her the mother\r\nof Christ more nearly approached the Mahometan conception of a pure\r\nmonotheism. Barsumas, or Barsaumas, bishop of Nisibis (435-485 A.D.),\r\nwas one of the most eminent leaders of the new heresy. He succeeded\r\nin gaining many adherents in Persia. Maanes, bishop of Ardaschiv, was\r\nhis principal coadjutor; he was the means of propagating the Nestorian\r\ndoctrines in Egypt, Syria, Arabia, India, Tartary, and even China.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CALIPHS.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Mohammed himself (569-609), the Arabians had physicians\r\nwho had been educated in the Greek schools of medicine living amongst\r\nthem. Pococke mentions a Greek physician named Theodunus, who was in\r\nthe service of Hajáj Ibn Yúsuf in the seventh century. He wrote a sort\r\nof medical compendium for the use of his son. Hajáj seems also to\r\nhave employed another Greek doctor named Theodocus, who had numerous\r\npupils.[679]\r\n\r\nThe House of Ommiyah encouraged the cultivation of the sciences. The\r\nCaliph Moawiyah, who resided at Damascus, founded schools, libraries,\r\nand observatories there, and invited the learned of all nations,\r\nespecially Greeks, to settle there, and teach his people their arts and\r\nsciences.[680]\r\n\r\nIn the seventh century, Alexandria under the rule of Islam was in\r\npossession of many medical schools in which the principles of Galen\r\nwere taught.[681]\r\n\r\nAlkinani, an Arabian Christian, who afterwards was converted to\r\nIslamism, was chiefly instrumental in introducing medical teaching into\r\nAntioch and Harran from Alexandria.[682]\r\n\r\nThe Caliph Almansor had studied astronomy. Almamon, the seventh of\r\nthe Abbassides, collected from Armenia, Syria, and Egypt all the\r\nvolumes of Grecian science he could obtain; they were translated into\r\nArabic, and his subjects were earnestly exhorted to study them. “He\r\nwas not ignorant,” says Abulpharagius, “that they are the elect of\r\nGod, His best and most useful servants, whose lives are devoted to\r\nthe improvement of their rational faculties.” Succeeding princes of\r\nthe line of Abbas, and their rivals the Fatimites of Africa and the\r\nOmmiades of Spain, says Gibbon, were the patrons of the learned, “and\r\ntheir emulation diffused the taste and the rewards of science from\r\nSamarcand and Bochara to Fez and Cordova.”[683]\r\n\r\nIt was Almamon who caused the works of the fathers of Indian medical\r\nscience to be translated first into Persian and then into Arabic; thus\r\nit was that the Saracens became familiar with the medical wisdom of\r\nSusruta and Charaka in the eighth century of our era.[684]\r\n\r\nCharaka is frequently mentioned in the Latin translations of Avicenna\r\n(Ibn Sina), Rhazes (Al Rasi), and Serapion (Ibn Serabi).[685]\r\n\r\nChaldee works at this time were also translated into Persian. In\r\nthe first centuries of the Hijra the Caliphs of Baghdad caused a\r\nconsiderable number of works upon Hindu medicine to be translated into\r\nPersian.[686] At the time of Mohammed there existed a famous school of\r\nmedicine at Senaa in Southern Arabia, the principal of which, Harit Ben\r\nKaldah, had learned his profession in India.[687]\r\n\r\nWhen the son of Mesuach, a young Nestorian Christian, first entered\r\nBaghdad, it is said[688] that he appeared to have discovered a new\r\nworld. He applied himself to the study of medicine, philosophy, and\r\nastronomy. He became a “treasure of learning,” and was chosen to\r\nattend Prince Almamon, the son of Haroun-al-Raschid, who, when he\r\nbecame Caliph in 813, invited learned men of all religions and of all\r\nnations to his court, collected from them the names of all the great\r\nauthors and the titles of their books which had been published in\r\nGreek, Syriac, and Persian, and then sent to all parts of the world to\r\npurchase them.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs studied Aristotle; and when Western Europe had long been\r\nsunk in intellectual darkness and had forgotten him, the Saracens\r\ntaught him to the Christians of the West. “He was read at Samarcand\r\nand at Lisbon,” says Freeman, “when no one knew his name at Oxford or\r\nEdinburgh.”[689] In his own tongue at Constantinople and Thessalonica\r\nhe had never been forgotten. Such learning and science as the Saracens\r\ndid not receive from India, such as the Arabic numerals, came to them\r\nfrom the West. They developed and improved much, but they probably\r\ninvented nothing. Freeman says[690] that after careful investigation\r\nhe observed three things: first, that whatever the Arabs learned was\r\nfrom translations of Greek works; secondly, that they made use of only\r\nan infinitesimal portion of Greek literature; thirdly, that many of\r\ntheir most famous literary men were not Mahometans at all, but Jews or\r\nChristians.[691] Greek poetry, history, and philosophy had little charm\r\nfor them. Gibbon says there is no record of an Arabian translation of\r\nany Greek poet, orator, or historian.[692]\r\n\r\nLearned Nestorians, Jacobites, and Jews in Persia and Syria occupied\r\nthemselves with translations from Greek authors, and contributed\r\ngreatly to the extension of Western culture in Eastern lands.[693] To\r\nthe world at large Mahomet was but an impostor; to the Arab of the\r\nseventh century he was a true prophet and the greatest of benefactors.\r\n\r\nWhen the Persian king reproached the Arabs with their poverty and their\r\nsavage condition, the reply of the Saracen envoy contains a grand\r\nsummary of the immediate results of Mahomet’s teaching.[694]\r\n\r\n“Whatever thou hast said,” replied Sheikh Maghareh, “respecting the\r\nformer condition of the Arabs is true. Their food was green lizards;\r\nthey buried their infant daughters alive; nay, some of them feasted on\r\ndead carcases and drank blood; while others slew their relations, and\r\nthought themselves great and valiant, when by such an act they became\r\npossessed of more property; they were clothed with hair garments; knew\r\nnot good from evil; and made no distinction between that which is\r\nlawful and that which is unlawful. Such was our state. But God, in His\r\nmercy, has sent us by a holy prophet a sacred volume, which teaches us\r\nthe true faith.”[695]\r\n\r\nGEORGE BACKTISCHWAH, or BOCHT JESU, was a Greek physician, a descendant\r\nof the persecuted Christians of the Greek empire, who embracing the\r\nheresy of Nestorius had been compelled to fly for safety and peace\r\nto the Persians. Al-Manzor (754-775) invited Backtischwah to his\r\ncourt, and this physician was the first to present to the Arabians\r\ntranslations of the medical works of the Greeks. The Nestorians had\r\nfounded a school of medicine in the province of Gondisapor, which was\r\nalready famous in the seventh century. From this school issued a crowd\r\nof learned Nestorians and Jews, famous for their knowledge of medicine\r\nand surgery, but still more for their ability to endow the East with\r\nall the treasures of Greek literature.[696]\r\n\r\n\r\nBAGHDAD.\r\n\r\nThe city of Baghdad was built by the Caliph Almansor, in A.D. 763, on\r\nthe ruins of a very ancient city; it soon became the most splendid\r\ncity in the East. Almansor had personally cultivated science, and\r\nwas a lover of letters and of learned men. He offered rewards for\r\ntranslations of Greek authors on philosophy, astronomy, mathematics,\r\nand medicine.\r\n\r\nA college was established by the Caliph which ultimately became famous.\r\nPublic hospitals and a medical school were also established by the same\r\nenlightened ruler. Meryon says[697] that there is reason to suppose\r\nthat in the laboratories established at Baghdad for the preparation of\r\nmedicines the science of chemistry may have first originated.[698]\r\n\r\nThe son of Mesuach presided over the translations of the works of Galen\r\nand all the treatises of Aristotle into Arabic; but when they had\r\nextracted the science from Greek literature, they consigned all the\r\nrest of it to the flames, as dangerous to the Moslem faith.[699]\r\n\r\nMany Christian physicians were employed at Baghdad.\r\n\r\nThe vizier of a Sultan gave two hundred thousand pieces of gold to\r\nfound a college at Baghdad, which he endowed with an annual revenue of\r\nfifteen thousand dinars.[700] Under the reign of Haroun-al-Raschid and\r\nhis successors this school flourished vigorously, and many translations\r\nof Greek medical works were made therein.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians have greatly distinguished themselves in the science of\r\nmedicine. In the city of Baghdad eight hundred and sixty physicians,\r\nsays Gibbon, were licensed to practise. The names of Mesua and Geber,\r\nof Rhazis and Avicenna are not less famous than are those of the\r\ngreatest names amongst the Greeks themselves. The independent medical\r\nliterature of the Saracens arose in the ninth century, and gradually\r\ndeveloped till it reached the zenith of its glory in the eleventh.\r\nThe mosques were then the universities, and besides that of Baghdad,\r\nBassora, Cufa, Samarcand, Ispahan, Damascus, Bokhara, Firuzabad, and\r\nKhurdistan, not omitting the schools of the Fatimites in Alexandria,\r\nwere centres of Eastern science and art, and the equally famous\r\nuniversities of Cordova, Seville, Toledo, Almeria, Murcia, Granada,\r\nand Valencia, sustained in Europe the dignity of the Arabian learning.\r\nWhen the conquest of Africa was complete, Spain was invaded, and about\r\nthe year 713 was reduced to a Moslem province. Cordova became not less\r\ndistinguished for learning than Baghdad, and many writers were given\r\nto the world from the adjacent towns of Malaga, Almeria, and Murcia.\r\nGibbon says that above seventy public libraries were opened in the\r\ncities of Andalusia.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Professor Nicholl, “The Semitic race is essentially\r\nunscientific, and adverse to the presentation of philosophical or moral\r\ntruth in a scientific form. The Indo-European genius, on the contrary,\r\ntends irresistibly towards intellectual system, or science.” This will\r\nat once be perceived when we examine the Vedas, the works of any Greek\r\nauthor, or those of Teutonic speculative writers, and then turn to\r\nany Semitic books. We instantly perceive that in the latter we have\r\nnothing but belief or intuition, with more or less of the doctrine\r\nof Revelation or Inspiration. In the works of Aryan origin, on the\r\ncontrary, we are at the opposite pole; we have speculation, inquiry,\r\nan insatiable desire to solve the mystery of things—the analytical\r\nspirit which asks a reason for every phenomenon in the universe. In the\r\nSemitic races this resolves itself into either a living faith and a\r\npure life corresponding thereto, or into a reckless fanaticism founded\r\non fatalism. In the Aryan races we have the most daring intellectual\r\nactivity, or the driest dogmatism.[701]\r\n\r\nIt was in Spain that the Semitic and Aryan intellects met and happily\r\nblended. Spain remembered the advantages of Roman influences long\r\nafter they were withdrawn. The Goths, who spread themselves over the\r\nPeninsula, preserved the remains of the civilization which the Romans\r\nhad left; and the Jews, afterwards to be treated with such cruel and\r\nbase ingratitude by the nation which they had so greatly benefited,\r\nadvanced the cause of education by their numerous schools and learned\r\nwriters.[702]\r\n\r\nOn this stage, then, we find the Semitic and the Indo-Germanic races\r\ntransferring to each other the characteristics with which they were\r\nmost happily endowed by nature.\r\n\r\nThe mosque schools of the Arabians were conducted on the model of\r\nthe Alexandrian schools. The old Egyptian and Jewish colleges were to\r\nsome extent the prototypes of these, and some writers think that our\r\nown universities were suggested by those of the Saracens. How great\r\nand famous some of these must have been, may be learned from the fact\r\nthat, as we have stated, no less than six thousand professors and\r\nstudents were collected together at Baghdad at one time. There were\r\nlecture rooms, laboratories, hospitals, and residences for teachers and\r\nstudents, besides the great halls which must have been required for the\r\nvast libraries which the Caliphs collected. It was in Spain perhaps\r\nthat Saracenic learning shone most brilliantly. In the early part of\r\nthe eighth century was founded the noble university of Cordova, the\r\ncity which, under Arabian rule, was called the “Centre of Religion,\r\nthe Mother of Philosophers, the Light of Andalusia.” It contained 300\r\nmosques, 200,000 houses, and 1,000,000 inhabitants, besides forty\r\nhospitals.[703]\r\n\r\nAbou-Ryan-el-Byrouny (died 941) travelled forty years studying\r\nmineralogy, and his treatise on precious stones, says Sismondi,[704]\r\nis a rich collection of facts. Aben-al-Beïthar of Malaga travelled\r\nover all the mountains and plains of Europe in search of plants, and\r\nrendered most important services to botany. He wandered over the sands\r\nof Africa and the remotest countries of Asia, examining and collecting\r\nanimals, fossils, and vegetables, and published his observations in\r\nthree volumes, which contained more science than any naturalist had\r\npreviously recorded.[705]\r\n\r\nIn one sense the Arabians were the inventors of chemistry, and never\r\nwas the science applied to the arts of life more beneficially than by\r\nthe Saracens in Spain.\r\n\r\nMahomet was skilled in the knowledge of medicine, and certain of his\r\naphorisms are extant concerning the healing art. Gibbon says[706]\r\nthat the temperance and exercise his followers preached, deprived\r\nthe doctors of the greater part of their practice. The only medicine\r\nrecommended by the Koran is honey (see Surah xvi. 71). “From its (the\r\nbee’s) belly cometh forth a fluid of varying hues, which yieldeth\r\nmedicine to man.” There is evidence of a belief in magic in the Koran\r\nas a charm against evil, and of incantations capable of producing\r\nill consequences to those against whom they were directed. The 113th\r\nchapter of the Koran was written when Mohammed believed that, by the\r\nwitchcraft of wicked persons, he had been afflicted with rheumatism.\r\nMohammedan peoples use as amulets to avert evil from themselves or\r\npossessions, a small Koran encased in silk or leather, or some of the\r\nnames of God, or of the prophets or saints, or the Mohammedan creed\r\nengraven on stone or silver.\r\n\r\nDa’wah, or the system of incantation used by Mohammedans, is employed\r\nto cause the cure, or the sickness and death of a person. The\r\nMohammedans have an elaborate system of exorcism, which is fully\r\nexplained by Mr. Thomas Patrick Hughes.[707]\r\n\r\nUroscopy, or the art of judging diseases by inspection of the urine,\r\nwas a great feature of Arabian as of Greek medical practice. It\r\nwas, however, with the former usually conducted with jugglery and\r\ncharlatanism, and there was seldom anything scientific about it.\r\n\r\nAs the religion of the Moslems forbade dissection, the sciences of\r\nanatomy and physiology and the art of surgery remained as they were\r\nborrowed from the Greek writers.\r\n\r\nThe Arabian faculty always stipulated for their fees beforehand; they\r\ndisapproved of gratuitous treatment, because, as they declared, “no one\r\ngets even thanks for it!”\r\n\r\nThere must have been female doctors, who, in the East, had abundant\r\nopportunities for practice, as men were not permitted by the customs of\r\nthe times to examine women. These female obstetricians performed the\r\ngravest operations, such as embryotomy and lithotomy.[708]\r\n\r\nHospitals were established at Damascus for lepers, the poor, the blind,\r\nand the sick, under the rule of the Caliph Walid.\r\n\r\nPaper is an Arabic invention. True, it has been made from silk from\r\nthe remotest ages in China, but by the Arabs it was first made at\r\nSamarcand, A.D. 649; and cotton paper, such as we use now, was made\r\nat Mecca, A.D. 706. The art was soon afterwards introduced by the\r\nArabs into Spain, where it was brought to the highest perfection.[709]\r\nGunpowder was known to the Arabs a hundred years before Europeans\r\nmention it.[710] The compass was used by them nearly two centuries\r\nbefore the Italians and French used it. The number of Arabic inventions\r\nwhich we unsuspectingly enjoy, without being aware of their origin,\r\nis prodigious. Could we bring to light the literary treasures of the\r\nEscurial, we should know something of the industrious host of Arabians\r\nwho have done so much for the learning of the Western world, and whose\r\nnames and deeds have received from us no recognition. Their historical,\r\ngeographical, and scientific dictionaries and histories would alone\r\nentitle them to the gratitude of an age which would know how to\r\nappreciate them.\r\n\r\nSismondi says that “Medicine and philosophy had even a greater number\r\nof historians than the other sciences; and all these different works\r\nwere embodied in the historical dictionary of sciences compiled by\r\nMohammed-Aba-Abdallah, of Granada.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ARABIAN PHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\nHONAIN, a Christian physician, flourished at Baghdad in the middle of\r\nthe ninth century. He travelled in Greece that he might perfect himself\r\nin the language, and he read the works of all the great writers of\r\nthat country. On his return to Baghdad he was invited by the Caliph\r\nto undertake the translation of the Greek authors. His best known\r\ntranslation is _The Aphorisms of Hippocrates with the Commentaries of\r\nGalen_. He wrote on midwifery, and was a good oculist.\r\n\r\nSERAPION THE ELDER (of Damascus), who flourished in the ninth century,\r\nwas a Syrian physician, of whom little or nothing is known except that\r\nhe wrote two works, one of which is in the Bodleian in MS., entitled\r\n_Aphorismi magni momenti de Medicina Practica_. The other is entitled\r\n_Kunnásh_, and has been translated into Latin.\r\n\r\nThe classical period of Arabian medicine begins with—\r\n\r\nRHAZES, “the Arabic Galen,” whose real name was _Abú Becr Mohammed Ibn\r\nZacaríyá Ar-Razi_, was born at Rai, near Chorásán, probably about the\r\nmiddle of the ninth century after Christ. His famous work, _On the\r\nSmall Pox and Measles_, was translated from the original Arabic into\r\nSyriac, and from that language into Greek. This is the first extant\r\nmedical treatise in which the small-pox is certainly mentioned.[711]\r\nThis famous book has been published in various languages about\r\nthirty-five times; a greater number of editions, says Dr. Greenhill,\r\nthan almost any other ancient medical treatise has passed through.\r\nHe was skilled in philosophy, astronomy, and music, as well as in\r\nmedicine, which he began to study when he was forty years old. He\r\nbecame one of the most celebrated physicians of his time, and was\r\nappointed physician to the hospital at Rai, and afterwards to that of\r\nBaghdad, where he became so famous as a teacher that pupils flocked to\r\nhim from all parts. He afterwards resided at the court of Cordova. He\r\ndied at an advanced age about A.D. 932. More than two hundred titles\r\nof his works have been preserved; but his small-pox treatise is the\r\nonly one which has been published in the original Arabic. It is a\r\nremarkable and a very interesting fact that he explained the nature of\r\nthe small-pox and measles by the theory of fermentation.[712]\r\n\r\nThe largest work of Rhazes is _Al-Háwí_, or the _Comprehensive_ book,\r\ncommonly called “Continens.” In the Latin translation this fills two\r\nfolio volumes. Although little more than a sort of medical commonplace\r\nbook, it has a value in that it has preserved for us many fragments\r\nfrom the works of ancient physicians which we should not otherwise have\r\npossessed. Another important work of Rhazes is the _Ketábu-l-Mansúri_,\r\nor _Liber ad Almansorem_, so called from being dedicated to Mansur,\r\nprince of Chorásán. It was intended to instruct the physician in\r\neverything which it was necessary for him to know. It is chiefly a\r\ncompilation, but was a popular text-book in the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies. Rhazes taught the external use of arsenic, mercurial\r\nointments, and sulphate of copper, and the internal use of brandy,\r\nnitre, borax, coral, and gems.\r\n\r\nALI BEN EL ABBAS (Ali Abbas), who lived in the latter part of the\r\ntenth century, was a Persian physician, who wrote a medical text book,\r\nentitled the _Royal Book_. Up to the time of Avicenna, this was the\r\nstandard authority on medicine amongst the Arabs, and was several times\r\ntranslated into Latin. In the theory of medicine and partly in its\r\npractice he followed the Greeks, but imitated the use of the excellent\r\nmateria medica of the Arabs. He wrote also on ophthalmology and\r\nobstetrics.\r\n\r\nAVICENNA, or EBN SINA, was called “the Prince of Physicians,” and was\r\nthe greatest philosopher produced by the Arabs in the East. He was\r\nborn in the province of Bokhara, in 980 A.D. It is related that at the\r\nage of sixteen he had learned all the science of a physician. Having\r\ncured Prince Nouh of a serious malady, he became a court favourite.\r\nAfter travelling for a while he composed his great work, the _Canon of\r\nMedicine_, by which his name was made famous both in Asia and Europe\r\nfor several centuries. In the midst of the troubles of an adventurous\r\nlife, he wrote a hundred gigantic books, the greatest of which was the\r\n_Al-Schefà_.\r\n\r\nISHAK BEN SOLEIMAN (830-940) wrote on dietetics, and is said to have\r\nbeen the first to introduce senna.\r\n\r\nSERAPION THE YOUNGER (about 1070). His work, _De Simplicibus\r\nMedicamentis_, was published in Latin at Milan in 1473.\r\n\r\nMESUE the younger (about 1015) was a pupil of Avicenna, and physician\r\nto the court at Cairo. He rendered great services to pharmacy by\r\nteaching the method of preparing extracts from medicinal plants.\r\n\r\nALBUCASIS was a skilful Arab physician, who wrote a work on surgery,\r\nentitled _Al Tassrif_, which contains much ingenious matter on the\r\nappliances of practical surgery. He died at Cordova about 1106. His\r\nwork treats of the application of the actual cautery, so much employed\r\nby the Arabs, of ligation of arteries in continuity, of the danger\r\nof amputating above the knee or elbow, of stitching the bowel with\r\nthreads scraped from the intestinal coat, operations for hare-lip and\r\ncataract, and fistula by cutting, ligature and cautery. He advised\r\nthe use of silver catheters as now employed, in place of the copper\r\nones used previously. He recommended anatomy as a valuable aid to\r\nsurgery.[713]\r\n\r\nAVENZOAR, one of the most famous of Arabian physicians, was born near\r\nSeville in the latter part of the twelfth century. He was instructed in\r\nmedicine by his father, whose family had long been connected with the\r\nhealing art. He was the rational improver of Arabian medicine by the\r\nrejection of useless theories, and asserted for medicine a place among\r\nthe advancing sciences of observation. He made it a constant practice\r\nto analyse the medicines he used, so that he might acquaint himself\r\nwith their exact composition. He was loaded with favours by the prince\r\nof Morocco, and died at the age of ninety-two in A.D. 1262.\r\n\r\nEBN ALBAITHAR (died about 1197) was a Moorish Spaniard, renowned for\r\nhis medical and botanical science. He traversed many regions of the\r\nwest of Africa and Asia to enlarge his botanical knowledge. He passed\r\nsome years at the court of Saladin, and wrote on the _Virtues of\r\nPlants_, and on poisons, metals, and animals.\r\n\r\nAVERROES, or EBN ROSCH, was born at Cordova in 1126. He learned\r\ntheology, philosophy, and medicine from the great teachers of his\r\ntime. He was the greatest Arabian inquirer in the West, as Avicenna\r\nwas in the East. He exercised the greatest influence both in his own\r\nand succeeding ages. He has been called “the Mohammedan Spinoza,”\r\nhaving been a religious freethinker. The study of Aristotle awakened\r\nin him a species of pantheism. He was more a philosopher than a\r\nphysician, but as he had made important observations in medicine, he\r\ndeserves a place amongst the heroes of the healing art. He was bitterly\r\npersecuted amongst his co-religionists for treating the Koran as a\r\nmerely human work. He taught that the small-pox never attacks the\r\nsame person more than once. In practice he held very rational views\r\nof the action of remedies, and taught that the work of the doctor was\r\nchiefly to apply general principles to individual cases. He wrote\r\ncommentaries on Aristotle so famous as to have gained him the name of\r\n“the Commentator.” He expounded the _Republic_ of Plato. He was a most\r\nvoluminous writer, and was considered by his contemporaries and by our\r\nschoolmen as a prodigy of science.[714]\r\n\r\nThere is a very interesting account of the Indian physicians at\r\nthe court of Baghdad in a translation made from a MS. in the Rich\r\ncollection in the British Museum.[715] The history is from the work of\r\nIbn Abu Usaibiâh, who lived at the beginning of the thirteenth century\r\nof our era.\r\n\r\nKankah the Indian was a great philosopher as well as a physician; he\r\ninvestigated the properties of medicines “and the composition of the\r\nheavenly bodies” (!).\r\n\r\nSanjahal, another learned Indian, wrote on medicine and astrology.\r\nFrom the science of the stars he applied himself to the symptoms\r\nof diseases, on which he wrote a book in ten chapters. He gave the\r\nsymptoms of four hundred and four diseases. He also wrote on _The\r\nImagination of Diseases_. Shánák wrote on poisons and the veterinary\r\nart. Jawdar was a philosopher and a physician who wrote a book on\r\nnativities. Mankah the Indian was learned in the art of medicine,\r\nand “gentle in his method of treatment.” He lived in the days of\r\nHaroun-al-Raschid.\r\n\r\nSalih, son of Bolah the Indian, was “well skilled in treatment, and had\r\npower and influence in the promotion of science.”\r\n\r\nKankah the Indian, says Prof. H. Wilson, was very celebrated in the\r\nhistory of Arabian astronomy. He says that it is certain that the\r\nastronomy and medicine of the Hindus were cultivated anteriorly to\r\nthose of the Greeks, by the Arabs of the eighth century. “It is\r\nclear that the Charaka, the Susruta, the treatises called Nidán on\r\ndiagnosis, and others on poisons, diseases of women, and therapeutics,\r\nall familiar to Hindu science, were translated and studied by the\r\nArabs in the days of Haroun and Mansur, either from the originals,\r\nor translations made at a still earlier period into the language of\r\nPersia.”[716]\r\n\r\nWe may conveniently mention here the famous Jew of Spain, Rabbi Moses\r\nben Maimon, or Maimonides (died 1198), a native of Cordova, who was\r\nprofoundly learned in mathematics, medicine, and other arts. He retired\r\nto Egypt, where he wrote books on medicine, which were much read. He\r\nadvised his patients never to sleep in the daytime, and at night only\r\non the side. He recommended them not to retire to rest till three to\r\nfour hours after supper.[717]\r\n\r\nMedical etiquette was rather strict. “Operations performed by the\r\nhand, such as venesection, cauterization, and incision of arteries,\r\nare not becoming a physician of respectability and consideration. They\r\nare suitable for the physician’s assistants only. These servants of\r\nthe physician should also do other operations, such as incision of the\r\neyelids, removing the veins in the white of the eye, and the removal of\r\ncataract. For an honourable physician nothing further is becoming than\r\nto impart to the patient advice with reference to food and medicine.\r\nFar be it from him to practise any operation with the hand. So say\r\nwe!”[718]\r\n\r\nDentistry was practised, but it was considered by the Arabs, as by the\r\nGreek and Roman doctors, a very inferior branch of the profession,\r\nand was, for the most part, as with ourselves, till very recently\r\nrelegated to uneducated persons. Midwifery also was, to a great\r\nextent, neglected by the higher class of physicians. The Arabian\r\nfaculty esteemed most highly medicine proper, though pharmacy and\r\nmateria medica were especially studied. The professors were paid by\r\nthe State, and handsomely as a rule. Their text books were the works\r\nof the Greek physicians, especially Hippocrates and Galen. A sort of\r\nmatriculation examination was required before a student could enter\r\nthe great schools, and he was subjected to professional examinations\r\n(not very severe, presumably) before he was permitted to practise. The\r\nArabian physicians were usually men of the highest culture; not only\r\nwere they men of science, but of philosophy and literature also. Great\r\nmystery was combined with Arabian medical practice; astrology was the\r\nhandmaid of medicine, and charms entered largely into therapeutics. The\r\nphysicians wrote prescriptions with purgative ink; so that “take this!”\r\nwas meant literally when the doctor gave the patient his prescription.\r\nIt had to be swallowed in due form.\r\n\r\nAlthough the great civilizations of the East date their origins from\r\na period far more remote than those of the West, they have lagged\r\nfar behind the West in progress. Professor Freeman defines European\r\nsociety as progressive, legal, monogamous, and, for the last fifteen\r\nhundred years, a Christian society; the East he defines as stationary,\r\narbitrary, polygamous, and Mahometan.[719] The dominant note of\r\nOriental history is sameness; a monotony which enables us to read in\r\nthe story of to-day that which took place amongst Eastern peoples\r\na thousand years ago. The history of a single city of Europe is of\r\ninfinitely greater interest to the student of humanity and the history\r\nof civilization than that of a whole nation of the East. The history\r\nof Florence alone is of greater importance, from this point of view,\r\nthan that of all China. There is, however, one marvellous history, that\r\nof Mahomet and his creed, which excels in interest that of any other\r\nman of the Oriental nations. “Nowhere,” says Freeman, “in the history\r\nof the world can we directly trace such mighty effects to the personal\r\nagency of a single mortal.”[720]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nRISE OF THE MONASTERIES.\r\n\r\n Alchemy the parent of Chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\nLearning in Europe was greatly advanced by the foundation of the famous\r\nmonastery of Monte Cassino, by ST. BENEDICT, near Naples, in the year\r\n529. The religious houses of this order, of which Monte Cassino was the\r\nparent, were the means of sheltering in those troublous times the men\r\nwho devoted themselves to literature and secular learning, as well as\r\nto the severities of the religious life. In these peaceful abodes men\r\nlearned how to make the desert blossom as the rose, agriculture and\r\nother civilizing occupations were studied and successfully practised,\r\nand from the sixth century to the ninth such medical knowledge as\r\nexisted in Europe chiefly emanated from these abodes of piety,\r\nindustry, and temperance. Missionaries issued from them to convert and\r\ncivilize the nations; and wherever the monks went, they acted as the\r\nhealers of the sick, as well as the spiritual advisers of the sinner.\r\nEverywhere they cultivated medicinal plants, whose properties they\r\nlearned to understand; by interchange of thought and comparison of\r\nopinions every monastery, with its constant going and coming of the\r\nbrethren, became an exchange of knowledge: the science of Spain was\r\ncarried to Italy, that of Italy to France and England, which in their\r\nturn contributed to the general stock of information such items of\r\nknowledge as they possessed. “If science,” says Schlegel,[721] “was\r\nthen of a very limited range, it was still quite proportioned to the\r\nexigencies and intellectual cultivation of the age; for mankind cannot\r\ntranscend all the degrees of civilization by a single bound, but must\r\nmount slowly and in succession its various grades.”\r\n\r\nALCUIN (735-804), the great reviver of learning in the eighth century,\r\nwas an ecclesiastic who instructed Charlemagne and his family in\r\nrhetoric, logic, mathematics, and divinity. “France,” says a great\r\nwriter, “is indebted to Alcuin for all the polite learning it boasted\r\nin that and the following ages. The universities of Paris, Tours,\r\nFulden, Soissons, and many others, owe to him their origin and\r\nincrease.” By the benefits he obtained from Charlemagne for the\r\nChristian schools which he founded, education began to revive in\r\nEurope, and by the Emperor’s command schools were established in every\r\nconvent and cathedral throughout his vast empire, wherein not clerics\r\nalone, but the sons of the nobility who were destined for a secular\r\nlife, could receive the highest education at that time attainable. “The\r\nmonasteries became a kind of fortress in which civilization sheltered\r\nitself under the banner of some saint; the culture of high intelligence\r\nwas preserved there, and philosophic truth was reborn there of\r\nreligious truth. Political truth, or liberty, found an exponent and a\r\ndefender in the monk, who searched into everything, said everything,\r\nand feared nothing. Without the inviolability and the leisure of the\r\ncloister, the books and the languages of the ancient world would never\r\nhave been transmitted to us, and the chain which connects the past with\r\nthe present would have been snapped. Astronomy, arithmetic, geometry,\r\ncivil law, physic and medicine, the profane authors, grammar, and\r\nthe _belles lettres_, all the arts, had a succession of professors\r\nuninterrupted from the first days of Clovis down to the age when\r\nthe universities, themselves religious foundations, brought science\r\nforth from the monasteries. To establish this fact it is enough to\r\nname Alcuin, Anghilbert, Eginhard, Treghan, Loup de Terrières, Eric\r\nd’Auxerre, Hincmar, Odo of Clugny, Cherbert, Abbon, Fulbert.”[722]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of the science of chemistry in its connection with\r\nthat of medicine, compels some allusion to its origin. Without question\r\nalchemy was the forerunner of chemistry. Beginning in the search for\r\nthe means of transmuting base metals into gold, it ultimately endowed\r\nus with a far more precious knowledge—the art of preparing many of our\r\nmost valuable medicines.\r\n\r\nThe first authentic account of alchemy is an edict of Diocletian about\r\nA.D. 300, in which a diligent search is ordered to be made in Egypt\r\nfor all the ancient books which treated of the art of making gold and\r\nsilver, that they might be destroyed. This shows that the pursuit\r\nmust have been of great antiquity. Fable credits Solomon, Pythagoras,\r\nand Hermes amongst its adepts. We find nothing more about it till its\r\nrevival by the Arabians some five or six hundred years later.[723]\r\n\r\nThe word _Alchemy_ is mentioned for the first time by the Byzantines.\r\nThe art of transmuting metals under the name of _Chemia_, is first\r\nspoken of by Suidas, who wrote in the tenth century. The Byzantines\r\nbegan to make chemical experiments about the seventh century; all\r\nthe books they quote were attributed to Hermes. What is known as the\r\nHermetic philosophy was synonymous with alchemy, but the books were\r\nreally the work of the monks of the period.[724]\r\n\r\nThe earliest works on alchemy which we possess are those of Geber of\r\nSeville, who lived probably about the eighth or ninth century. His\r\nworks were entitled _Of the Search of Perfection_, _Of the Sum of\r\nPerfection_, _Of the Invention of Verity_. He divided metals into the\r\nmore or less perfect, gold the most perfect, silver the next, etc. His\r\naim was to convert inferior metals into gold; that which should turn\r\nbase metals into gold would be also a universal medicine, would cure or\r\nprevent diseases, prolong life, and make the body beautiful and strong.\r\nThe philosopher’s stone would embrace in itself all perfections.\r\nAlchemy led to chemistry; it is even declared by some to have been the\r\nmother of chemistry. Some have thought that without the hope of making\r\ngold and other precious things, men would never have been inspired\r\nto investigate the secrets of nature and sustained in the arduous\r\nand often dangerous work of the chemist. But this is to take far too\r\nlow a view of the scientific mind in all ages. The search for truth,\r\nthe passion for investigating and interrogating nature has happily\r\nnever wholly depended upon mercenary motives, and men have devoted\r\ntheir lives as ardently to scientific researches, by which they could\r\nnever have hoped to gain a single penny, as did those alchemists of\r\nold, who bent over their crucibles in the vain search for the perfect\r\nmagistery.[725]\r\n\r\nGibbon says,[726] “The science of chemistry owes its origin and\r\nimprovement to the industry of the Saracens. They first invented and\r\nnamed the alembic for the purposes of distillation, analysed the\r\nsubstances of the three kingdoms of nature, tried the distinction and\r\naffinities of alkalis and acids, and converted the poisonous minerals\r\ninto soft and salutary medicines.” Gibbon somewhat exaggerates.\r\nAnalysis and affinity were discovered at a much later period. It was\r\nEuropeans in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries who advanced\r\nchemical science towards its present high position.\r\n\r\nNONNUS (10th century) wrote “a compendium of the whole art of\r\nmedicine,” in 290 chapters. It is a mere compilation, and the author\r\nis only worthy of remembrance in medical history as the earliest Greek\r\nmedical writer who mentions distilled rose-water, an article originally\r\nderived from the Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nRISE OF THE UNIVERSITIES.\r\n\r\n School of Montpellier.—Divorce of Medicine from Surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn important era in the history of medicine in Europe was the rise of\r\nthe universities. It is not possible to fix precisely the date of the\r\nfoundation of these great centres of learning, but we may sufficiently\r\nfor our purpose fix the twelfth century as approximately the period in\r\nwhich Bologna, Montpellier, Oxford, Cambridge, and Paris were regularly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nCambridge University took its rise in all probability somewhere in the\r\ntwelfth century, “originating in an effort on the part of the monks of\r\nEly to render a position of some military importance also a place of\r\neducation.”[727]\r\n\r\nThe most ancient universities in Europe are said to be those of\r\nBologna, Oxford, Cambridge, Paris, and Salamanca. The following dates\r\nare approximate: Bologna, 1116; Oxford, 879; Cambridge, twelfth\r\ncentury; Cordova, 968; Paris, 792, renovated 1200; Palenza, 1209,\r\nremoved to Salamanca, 1249. Salamanca was founded 1239; Naples, 1224;\r\nMontpellier, 1289; Rome, 1243; Salerno, 1233.[728]\r\n\r\nThe University of Bologna was famous as a school of law and letters so\r\nearly as the twelfth century. In the next it became distinguished for\r\nits medical teaching. It was in such perfection that its professors\r\nwere classed as physicians, surgeons, barber surgeons, and oculists.\r\nBut still, anatomy, except in so far as it assisted the surgeon,\r\nwas neglected. Roger, Roland, Jamerio, Bruno, and Lanfranc, seemed\r\nalone to have paid much attention to it, and then only to borrow from\r\nGalen.[729] The medical faculty became celebrated after 1280, when\r\nThaddeus Florentinus was a teacher in it.\r\n\r\nThe University of Padua was founded 1179.\r\n\r\nIn 1268 it possessed three teachers of medicine and the same number of\r\nteachers of natural science.\r\n\r\nMontpellier was the first great rival of Salerno as a school of\r\nmedicine. Its charter dates from 1229.\r\n\r\nMedicine was not taught at Paris during the twelfth century. John of\r\nSalisbury, writing in the year 1160, says that those who desired to\r\nstudy medicine had to go either to Salerno or Montpellier. But, says\r\nLaurie,[730] physicians of eminence are recorded as having taught at\r\nParis after this date, and the subject was formally lectured upon not\r\nlater than 1200. Degrees or licences in physic were granted in 1231.\r\n\r\nThe University of Naples was founded in 1224, by the Emperor Frederick\r\nII. Originally all the faculties were represented, but in 1231 medicine\r\nwas forbidden, as by Imperial decree it could only be taught at Salerno.\r\n\r\nThe University of Prague was founded in 1348 by Charles IV. of Bohemia,\r\nas a complete university from the outset.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF MONTPELLIER.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the medical school of Montpellier is obscure. Probably\r\nit originated in the tenth century, and there is little doubt that\r\nthe Jews of Spain were concerned in its foundation. The Arabs found\r\nfirm friends in the Jewish people of Spain, their monotheism proving\r\na bond of union which ensured the sympathy of each, and the school of\r\nMontpellier became the rallying-point of Arabian and Jewish learning.\r\nEurope has rendered too little gratitude for the intellectual blessings\r\nbestowed on her by the Hebrews. A nation of Eastern origin, and having\r\nvery extensive relations with Eastern commerce, the Israelites acted\r\nas the medium for transmitting the intellectual and material wealth\r\nof Eastern countries to Western peoples. We owe to them much of our\r\nacquaintance with Saracenic medicine and pharmacy. They translated\r\nfor us Arabic books, and they introduced to Western markets the\r\nprecious drugs of far-distant Eastern lands. The school of medicine\r\nof Montpellier first became famous in the beginning of the twelfth\r\ncentury. Averroism prevailed, and a practical empirical spirit\r\ndistinguished the school from the dogmatic and scholastic teaching of\r\nother universities. It has been attempted to show that a Jewish doctor\r\nfrom Narbonne first taught medicine at Montpellier. When Benjamin of\r\nTudela went to the university in 1160, he says that he found many\r\nJews amongst the inhabitants. Adalbert, Bishop of Mayence, went to\r\nMontpellier in 1137 to learn medicine from the doctors, “that he might\r\nunderstand the deeply hidden meaning of things.” In 1153 the Archbishop\r\nof Lyons went there for treatment, and John of Salisbury said that\r\nmedicine was to be acquired either at Salerno or Montpellier. Men\r\ncalled the school the “Fountain of Medical Wisdom,” and it soon rose to\r\ngreat importance on account of its unlimited freedom in teaching.[731]\r\n\r\nCardinal Conrad made a law that no one should act as a teacher of\r\nmedicine in the university who had not been examined in it and received\r\na licence to teach. In 1230 it was ordered that no one should practise\r\nmedicine until he had been examined, and that to the satisfaction of\r\ntwo masters in medical science chosen as examiners by the bishop. To\r\nengage in practice without the certificate of the examiners and the\r\nbishop was to incur the sentence of excommunication.[732] Surgeons,\r\nhowever, were not compelled to undergo examination. Medicine flourished\r\nat Montpellier with great independence; it was not merged with the\r\nother faculties, and it was not subjected to clerical influences.[733]\r\nEven Louis XIV. was obliged to withdraw a decree ordering the union of\r\nthe medical with the other faculties.[734]\r\n\r\nEvery student was compelled (1308) to attend medical lectures for at\r\nleast five years, and to practise medicine for eight months, before\r\nbeing allowed to graduate. In 1350 the degree of Magister had to be\r\ntaken in addition.[735]\r\n\r\nThe most brilliant period in the history of the medical school of\r\nMontpellier was that of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Its\r\nfame was sounded throughout the world. From all parts invalids went to\r\nMontpellier to seek its famous physicians. King John of Bohemia, and\r\nthe Bishop of Hereford, were of the number.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVORCE OF MEDICINE FROM SURGERY.\r\n\r\nSurgery became separated from medicine in Alexandria, but it was not\r\nuntil the middle of the twelfth century that the ecclesiastics were\r\nrestrained from undertaking any bloody operations. The universities\r\nrejected surgery under the pretext, “_ecclesia abhorret a sanguine_”\r\n(the church abhors the shedding of blood). It is therefore to this\r\nepoch, as Mr. Cooper says,[736] that we must refer the true separation\r\nof medicine from surgery; the latter was entirely abandoned to the\r\nignorant laity.\r\n\r\nAt the Council of Tours, A.D. 1163, the practice of surgery was\r\ndenounced as unfit for the hands of priests and men of literature, the\r\nconsequence being that the surgeon became little better than a sort\r\nof professional servant to the physician, the latter not only having\r\nthe sole privilege of prescribing internal medicines, but even that of\r\njudging and directing when surgical operations should be performed.\r\nThen the subordinate surgeon was only called upon to execute with his\r\nknife, or his hand, duties which the more exalted physician did not\r\nchoose to undertake; and, in fact, he visited the patient, did what was\r\nrequired to be done, and took his leave of the case, altogether under\r\nthe orders of his master.[737]\r\n\r\nJOHN OF SALISBURY, one of the most learned men of the twelfth century,\r\ngives an account of the state of medicine in that period, which is\r\nvery suggestive. “The professors of the theory of medicine are very\r\ncommunicative; they will tell you all they know, and, perhaps, out\r\nof their great kindness a little more. From them you may learn the\r\nnature of all things, the causes of sickness and of health, how to\r\nbanish the one and how to preserve the other; for they can do both at\r\npleasure. They will describe to you minutely the origin, the beginning,\r\nthe progress, and the cure of all diseases. In a word, when I hear\r\nthem harangue, I am charmed; I think them not inferior to Mercury or\r\nÆsculapius, and almost persuade myself that they can raise the dead.\r\nThere is only one thing that makes me hesitate. Their theories are as\r\ndirectly opposite to one another as light and darkness. When I reflect\r\non this, I am a little staggered. Two contradictory propositions cannot\r\nboth be true. But what shall I say of the practical physicians? I must\r\nsay nothing amiss of them. It pleaseth God, for the punishment of my\r\nsins, to suffer me to fall too frequently into their hands. They must\r\nbe soothed, and not exasperated. That I may not be treated roughly in\r\nmy next illness, I dare hardly allow myself to think in secret what\r\nothers speak aloud.”\r\n\r\nIn another work, however, the writer delivers himself with greater\r\nfreedom. Speaking of newly-fledged medicos, he says: “They soon return\r\nfrom college, full of flimsy theories, to practise what they have\r\nlearned. Galen and Hippocrates are continually in their mouths. They\r\nspeak aphorisms on every subject, and make their hearers stare at their\r\nlong, unknown, and high-sounding words. The good people believe that\r\nthey can do anything, because they pretend to all things. They have\r\nonly two maxims which they never violate: never mind the poor, never\r\nrefuse money from the rich.”\r\n\r\nROBERT OF GLOUCESTER[738] does not write very highly of the skill\r\nin surgery possessed by the Anglo-Normans. Speaking of the Duke of\r\nAustria, who took King Richard the First prisoner, his verses import\r\nthat when “he fell off from his horse and sorely bruised his foot,\r\nhis physicians declared that if it was not immediately smitten off, he\r\nwould die; but none would undertake the performance of the operation;\r\ntill the Duke took a sharp axe, and bid the chamberlain strike it\r\noff, and he smote thrice ere he could do it, putting the Duke to most\r\nhorrid torture. And Holinshed tells us that in the time of Henry the\r\nThird there lived one Richard, surnamed Medicus, ‘a most learned\r\nphysician, and no less expert in philosophy and mathematics;’ but makes\r\nnot the least mention of surgery. Also some authors have attributed\r\nthe death of Richard the First (wounded in the shoulder at the Castle\r\nof Chalezun), to the unskilfulness of those who had the care of the\r\nwound, and not from the quarrel’s being poisoned, as others have\r\ninsinuated.”[739]\r\n\r\nThe university title of Doctor was not known in England before the\r\nreign of Henry II.[740]\r\n\r\nRICHARD FITZ-NIGEL, Bishop of London, was apothecary to Henry II. Many\r\nbishops and dignitaries of the Church were physicians to kings and\r\nprinces.[741] Most of the practitioners of medicine and teachers of\r\nphysic were churchmen, either priests or monks.\r\n\r\nST. HILDEGARD (1098-1179), Abbess of Ruppertsberg, near Bingen on\r\nthe Rhine, was a famous physician and student of nature, who wrote a\r\ntreatise on Materia Medica. Her pharmacy was in advance of her time,\r\nand to this eminent lady physician we are indebted for the attempts to\r\ndisguise the nastiness of physic; she enveloped the remedy in flour,\r\nwhich was then made into pancakes and eaten.[742] Meyer says that her\r\nwork entitled _Physica_ “is a treatise on Materia Medica, unmistakably\r\nfounded on popular traditions.” Her visions and revelations concerning\r\nphysical and medical questions are contained in her work “_Divinorum\r\noperum simplicis hominis liber_.” She was a true reformer within the\r\nChurch, and her pure life was singularly devoted and unselfish; she\r\nwas, in fact, a Woman Physician, who should be the patron saint of our\r\nlady doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL OF SALERNO.\r\n\r\n The Monks of Monte Cassino.—Clerical Influence at\r\n Salerno.—Charlemagne.—Arabian Medicine gradually\r\n supplanted the Græco-Latin Science.—Constantine the\r\n Carthaginian.—Archimatthæus.—Trotula.—Anatomy of the\r\n Pig.—Pharmacopœias.—The Four Masters.—Roger and Rolando.—The Emperor\r\n Frederick.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe connecting link between the ancient and the modern medicine was\r\nthe school of Salerno. It is true that Hippocrates and Galen in\r\nArabian costume re-entered Europe after a long absence in the East,\r\nwhen the Moors occupied a great part of Spain; but great as was this\r\nSaracenic influence on medical science, it was not to be compared with\r\nthe powerful and permanent influence secured by the native growth of\r\nmedical science which sprung up on Italian soil.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this celebrated mediæval institution is involved in\r\nobscurity; it has been generally understood to have sprung from the\r\nmonastery of Monte Cassino, founded by St. Benedict in the sixth\r\ncentury. St. Benedict probably possessed some medical knowledge, and\r\nit is certain that many of his order did. The Benedictines had houses\r\nin La Cava and Salerno. The legends of the wonderful cures wrought\r\nby St. Benedict would naturally attract crowds of sufferers to the\r\ndoors of the learned and charitable monks. There would consequently be\r\nabundant opportunities for the study of diseases and their remedies;\r\nand though there was probably little enough of what could strictly be\r\ncalled scientific medical practice, there was doubtless as much effort\r\nto cure or mitigate suffering as was consistent with the rule of a\r\nlearned religious order. Some writers think that the famous school of\r\nSalerno existed as early as the seventh century, that Greek thought\r\nand traditions lingered there long after they had ceased to exist in\r\nother parts of Italy; and they argue that as it was, as is now clearly\r\nshown, a purely secular institution, it was independent in origin\r\nand constitution of any monastic connection. Others maintain that\r\nit was founded by the Arabs; but, as Daremberg points out,[743] the\r\nfirst invasions of the Saracens in Sicily and Italy, dating from the\r\nmiddle of the ninth century, had for their objects simply pillage and\r\nslaughter; and there is nothing whatever to show in the whole course of\r\ntheir devastations the slightest desire to found literary or scientific\r\ninstitutions. The Saracens never sojourned at Salerno, and before the\r\nend of the eleventh century there is no trace of Arabian medicine\r\nin the works written by the great teachers of Salerno. It is as\r\nunnecessary as it is unjust to seek any other origin for the Salernian\r\nschool than that of the Benedictines of Monte Cassino.[744] Bede,\r\nCuthbert, Auperth, and Paul were brought up at that monastery, and we\r\nknow that medicine was always cultivated to a certain extent in those\r\nancient abodes of learning and religion. As Balmez says concerning\r\nMonte Cassino,[745] “the sons of the most illustrious families of the\r\nempire are seen to come from all parts to that monastery; some with\r\nthe intention of remaining there for ever, others to receive a good\r\neducation, and some to carry back to the world a recollection of the\r\nserious inspirations which the holy founder had received at Subiaco.”\r\nIt seems, therefore, that the origin of the medical school of Salerno\r\nwas somewhat on this wise: a lay spirit of science was developed, and\r\nmany young men having no aptitude for the monastic life, but desirous\r\nto devote themselves entirely to the healing art as an honourable and\r\nlucrative profession, doubtless desired to form themselves into a\r\nsociety or school for this end; they would receive encouragement from\r\ntheir more liberal and enlightened monastic teachers to settle in a\r\nbeautiful and healthy resort of invalids such as Salerno had long been\r\nconsidered, and to pursue their medical studies under the supervision\r\nof the men most competent to instruct them. Dr. Puschmann, quoting from\r\nS. de Renzi,[746] states that in documents of the years 848 and 855,\r\nJOSEPH and JOSHUA are named as doctors practising there. The Lombard\r\nREGENIFRID lived there in the year 900; he was physician to Prince\r\nWAIMAR of Salerno. Fifty years later the doctor PETRUS was raised to\r\nthe bishopric of Salerno. Many doctors of this time were clerics, but\r\nthere were also many who were Jews.[747] This ancient people, hated and\r\npersecuted in every other relation of life, were popular as physicians\r\nin the Middle Ages. The books studied and expounded were Hippocrates\r\nand Galen, which were translated into Latin before A.D. 560.[748]\r\n\r\nIts cosmopolitan sentiments probably gave rise to the story that is\r\ntold in an ancient Salernian chronicle, rediscovered by S. de Renzi,\r\nto the effect that the school was founded by four doctors; namely, the\r\nJewish Rabbi ELINUS, the Greek PONTUS, the Saracen ADALA, and a native\r\nof Salerno, who each lectured in his native tongue.[749]\r\n\r\nIt is said that Charlemagne in 802 A.D. greatly encouraged this Salerno\r\nschool by ordering Greek works of medicine to be translated from the\r\nArabic into Latin. Salernum, in consequence of the medical and public\r\ninstructions given by the monks in the neighbouring monastery, became\r\nknown as a _civitas Hippocratica_.[750]\r\n\r\nBERTHARIUS, abbot from 856, was a very learned man; and it is stated\r\nthat there are still in existence two manuscripts of his which contain\r\na collection of hygienic and medicinal rules and prescriptions.[751]\r\n\r\nALPHANUS (SECUNDUS) (flourished about 1050), a distinguished monastic\r\nphilosopher and theologian, wrote a treatise on _The Union of the Soul\r\nand Body_, and another on _The Four Humours_. He carried with him,\r\nwhen he removed to Florence, many manuscripts and a great quantity\r\nof medicines. During the eleventh century Salerno rose to great\r\nimportance, not only from its situation as a port from which the\r\nCrusaders departed to the wars, but from the daily widening influence\r\nof its medical school.\r\n\r\nPETROCELLUS wrote on the practice of medicine about 1035; he was the\r\nauthor of the _Compendium of Medicine_. GARIOPONTUS (died before\r\n1056) wrote a work entitled _Passionarius Galeni_. These are the\r\ntwo most ancient works of this school which have reached our times,\r\nsays Daremberg. The medicine of Salerno before the year 1050 was a\r\ncombination of methodism in its doctrines and of Galenisms in its\r\nprescriptions.[752] We find, says Baas,[753] in Gariopontus the first\r\nintimation of the inhalation of narcotic vapours in medicine, while\r\nthe ancients could only produce anæsthesia by compression and the\r\ninternal use of such drugs as mandragora and belladonna. Herodotus\r\nsays[754] that the Scythians used the vapour of hemp seed to intoxicate\r\nthemselves by inhaling it, but this was not for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\nDESIDERIUS was abbot of Salerno, and afterwards became Pope Victor III.\r\nin 1085. He is said to have been _medicinæ peritissimus_.[755]\r\n\r\nAbout this time flourished _Constantine_, the Carthaginian Christian,\r\nwhose fame was European, and who finally placed Salerno in the front as\r\na great and specialized public school of medicine. He travelled far in\r\nthe East, and is said to have learned mathematics, necromancy, and the\r\nsciences in Babylon. He visited India and Egypt, and when he returned\r\nto Carthage he was the most learned man of his time in all that\r\nrelated to medical science. Naturally he was suspected of witchcraft,\r\nand he fled for refuge to Salerno. Robert Guiscard the Norman held\r\nhim in the highest favour, and under his protection he published many\r\nworks of medicine of his own, and made many translations of medical\r\nbooks from the Arabic. He ultimately retired to the monastery of Monte\r\nCassino, where he died in 1087. We may safely date the establishment\r\nof the splendid reputation of the Salerno school from the time of his\r\nsettlement there.[756]\r\n\r\nDaremberg does not allow that the influence of Constantine was so\r\ngreat as is generally supposed. He points out that it was not in the\r\nmiddle of the eleventh but at the end of the twelfth century that\r\nArabian medicine was substituted in the school of Salerno, as in the\r\nWest generally, for the Græco-Latin. And it is perfectly true that if\r\nwe examine the medical writings of this period we find very little\r\nprogress from the times of the ancients, except in pharmacy and the\r\nknowledge of drugs and their properties. Daremberg’s researches go\r\nto prove that many of Constantine’s works, previously supposed to\r\nhave been original, were but cunningly disguised translations from\r\nthe Arabic. By altering the phraseology, and suppressing such proper\r\nnames as would have led to suspicion of the origin of his treatises,\r\nhe obtained credit for a great mass of literary work which had really\r\nanother source.[757]\r\n\r\nJEAN AFFLACIUS, a disciple of Constantine, wrote _The Golden Book on\r\nthe Treatment of Diseases_, and another work _On the Treatment of\r\nFevers_.[758] Daremberg says that these works of Afflacius show no more\r\ntraces of Arabian influence than the works of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nHe advised that the air of the sick-room should be kept cool by the\r\nevaporation of water, and he administered iron in enlargement of the\r\nspleen.\r\n\r\nARCHIMATTHÆUS lived soon after Constantine; his name occurs about\r\nthe year 1100 as the author of two important books on medicine, _The\r\nInstruction of the Physician_ and _The Practice_. The former work\r\nis occupied with advice, sometimes exaggerated, on the dignity of\r\nthe healing art; and though it appears childish enough to our more\r\nsophisticated age, it is not without evidence of a desire to instruct\r\nthe doctor in all that relates to the welfare of the patient and\r\nthe dangers incurred by any deviation from the strictest code of\r\nprofessional rectitude. It is unfortunately, however, blended with so\r\nmuch that is crafty and sly that it approaches in some directions very\r\nclosely to charlatanism. Archimatthæus very minutely instructs the\r\ndoctor how to comport himself when called to visit a patient.[759]\r\n\r\nHe should place himself under the protection of God and under the\r\ncare of the angel who accompanied Tobias. On the way to the patient’s\r\nhome he should take care to learn from the messenger sent for him the\r\nstate of the patient, so that he may be, on reaching the bedside,\r\nwell posted in all that concerns the case; then if, after he has\r\nexamined the urine and the state of the pulse, he is not able to\r\nmake an accurate diagnosis, he will at least be able, thanks to his\r\nprevious information, to impress the patient with the conviction that\r\nhe completely understands his case, and so will gain his confidence.\r\nThe author considers it very important that the sick person, before\r\nthe arrival of the physician, should send for a priest to hear his\r\nconfession, or at least promise to do so; for if the doctor were to\r\nsee reason to suggest this himself, it would give the patient cause to\r\nsuppose that his case was hopeless. “Upon entering the house of his\r\npatient, the physician should salute all with a grave and modest air,\r\nnot exhibiting any eagerness, but seating himself to take breath; he\r\nshould praise the beauty of the situation,[760] the good arrangements\r\nof the house, the generosity of the family; by this means he wins\r\nthe good opinion of the household, and gives the sick person time to\r\nrecover himself a little.” After the most careful directions as to\r\nthe examination of the patient, the author takes the doctor from the\r\nhouse with as much artfulness as he has brought him hither. He is to\r\npromise the patient a good recovery, but privately to the friends he\r\nis to explain that the illness is a very serious one: “if he recovers,\r\nyour reputation is increased; if he succumbs, people will not fail\r\nto remember that you foresaw the fatal termination of the disease.”\r\nIf he is asked to dine, “as is the custom,” he is to show himself\r\nneither indiscreet nor over-nice. If the table is delicate, he is not\r\nto become absorbed in its pleasures, but to leave the table every now\r\nand then to see how the patient progresses, so as to show that he has\r\nnot been forgotten while the doctor was feasting. He is honestly to\r\ndemand his fee, and then go in peace, his heart content and his purse\r\nfull. In the _Practice_ of the same author, we have, says Daremberg,\r\na true _Clinic_, the first work of the kind since the _Epidemics_ of\r\nHippocrates; it exhibits a skilful practitioner, a good observer, and a\r\nbold therapeutist. The doctrines and methods are those of Hippocrates\r\nand Galen, but not of the Arabs. It is also interesting as proving\r\nthat at this period the distinction was established between the true\r\nphysicians and the common physicians, or the specialists and the\r\ngeneral practitioners or physician-apothecaries.\r\n\r\nA remarkable and interesting feature in the history of the school of\r\nSalerno is the fact that some of its most famous professors of medicine\r\nwere ladies. About the year 1059, TROTULA, a female physician, wrote a\r\nwell-known book on the diseases of women, and their treatment before,\r\nduring, and after labour. She discusses all branches of pathology, even\r\nof the male sexual organs.[761] It was supposed that she was the wife\r\nof John Platearius the elder, and that she belonged to the noble family\r\nof Roger. Her person and name were at one time considered legend and\r\nmyth, but M. Renzi’s investigations have proved her to be sufficiently\r\nhistorical. Trotula lived at Salerno, as is shown by the _Compendium\r\nSalernitanum_, and she practised in that city, as is clear from her\r\nwork on the diseases of women. Her name occurs variously as Trotula,\r\nTrotta, and Trocta.[762]\r\n\r\nABELLA wrote a treatise _De Natura Seminis Humani_; she was a colleague\r\nof Trotula’s. COSTANZA CALENDA was the daughter of the principal of\r\nthe medical school, and was distinguished both for her beauty and her\r\ntalents; she left no writings. MERCURIADIS and REBECCA GUARNA were\r\ndoctresses of the fifteenth century. They wrote chiefly on midwifery\r\nand diseases of women.[763]\r\n\r\nCOPHO, in the early part of the twelfth century, was an anatomist,\r\nand probably a Jew; he wrote the _Anatomy of the Pig_. Students were\r\ninstructed in dissections by operating on dead animals when, as in\r\nthose days, human bodies were not accessible. The pig was killed by\r\nsevering the vessels of the neck, and was then hung up by the hind\r\nlegs, and when the blood had escaped the body was used for teaching\r\npurposes; it was not dissected in the modern sense at all, the\r\nexamination consisting merely in observation of the great cavities and\r\nthe vital organs, according to the suggestions of Galen and the old\r\nanatomists.[764]\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS PRÆPOSITUS, about 1140, was the president of the school, and\r\nwrote a famous book called the _Antidotarium_—a Pharmacopœia as we\r\nshould call it. This book of recipes was compiled from the works of\r\nthe Arabian doctors Mesues, Avicenna, Actuarius, Nicolaus Myrepsus, as\r\nwell as from Galen. It is interesting as giving the forms which the\r\ncompounders of the prescriptions were sworn on their oath to observe;\r\nthey promised to make up all their potions, syrups, etc., “_secundum\r\nprædictam formam_,” and they further promised that their drugs should\r\nbe fresh and sufficient. It shows also that there was a habit of\r\nwriting a prescription when a patient was visited; this, it seems, was\r\na custom which originated with the Arabian physicians.[765]\r\n\r\nNicholas was also the author, says Dr. Baas,[766] of a work called\r\n“_Quid pro Quo_,” which was a list of drugs which were equivalent to\r\nother drugs, and might be used as substitutes for each other in case\r\nof either running short. Dr. Baas says our expression “Quid pro Quo”\r\noriginated from this.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Bartholomæus and of Copho the Younger (between 1100\r\nand 1120), says Daremberg, are of great interest in the history of\r\nmedicine; they show how great was the freedom of spirit which existed\r\nat Salerno at this time. Copho described certain diseases which were\r\nnot referred to in the works of other writers of Salerno; for example,\r\nulceration of the palate and trachea, polypi, scrofulous tumours of\r\nthe throat, condylomata, etc. Bartholomæus and Copho also held certain\r\noriginal ideas as to the classification of fevers. Copho distinguished\r\nbetween medicine for the rich and for the poor: the rich are delicate,\r\nand must be cured agreeably; the poor wish only to be cured at as\r\nlittle cost as possible. Thus the nobles must be purged with finely\r\npowdered rhubarb, the poor, with a decoction of mirobalanum, sweetened\r\nor not. Naturally the more precious drugs would be used for the\r\nwealthy, and probably the poor, who could not afford the complicated\r\nand terrible confections of mediæval pharmacy, might have congratulated\r\nthemselves on being treated with a few simples instead of the precious\r\nmesses which the wealthy had to swallow.\r\n\r\nJOHANNES PLATEARIUS deserves notice as having been the inventor of the\r\nterm “Cataracta,” in place of the ancient Egyptian “ascent” and the\r\nGreek “hypochosis,” in classical Latin “suffusio humorum” (Hirsch).[767]\r\n\r\nMATTHÆUS PLATEARIUS was the son of the above; he composed a _Practica\r\nBrevis_ and other books on medicine; it is not certain at what precise\r\ndate they flourished.\r\n\r\nÆGIDIUS “CORBOLENSIS,” canon of Paris, physician to Philip Augustus,\r\nking of France (1165-1213), wrote a poem on the decline of Salerno as\r\na medical school; he describes the doctors as caring nothing for books\r\nwhich were not full of recipes, and the professors as merely beardless\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nThe famous but somewhat mysterious “Four Masters” were commentators on\r\nthe surgery of Roger and Roland.\r\n\r\nMUSANDINUS wrote on the diet of the sick; bleeding was recommended for\r\nthe want of appetite in convalescents, and patients were rather to be\r\npurged to death than permitted to die constipated.\r\n\r\nBERNARD THE PROVINCIAL recommends wine for the delicate stomachs\r\nof bishops; he said they could not bear emetics unless they were\r\nadministered on a full stomach. His treatise was written between the\r\nyears 1150 and 1160. He did much to simplify the materia medica of his\r\ntime, advising the poor not to waste their means on costly foreign\r\ndrugs, but to gather simples from the fields. It is interesting to find\r\nin the thirteenth century police regulations which required in many\r\ncities of Italy that physicians should inspect druggists’ shops and\r\nsee that their medicines were pure and fresh. Pharmacy, it seems, was\r\nalready becoming divorced from medical practice.[768]\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the twelfth century there appeared a didactic poem\r\ncalled _Schola Salernitana, Flos Medicinæ_, or _Regimen Sanitatis_,\r\nor _Regimen Virile_. This celebrated work went through hundreds of\r\neditions.[769]\r\n\r\nDr. Handerson, in his translation of Baas’ _History of Medicine_, says\r\nit had other titles than those given above, as _Medicina Salernitana_,\r\n_De Conservanda Bona Valetudine_, _Lilium Sanitatis_, _Compendium\r\nSalernitanum_, etc. The work was for centuries the physician’s _vade\r\nmecum_. It is not known who was the author; originally it was put forth\r\nas emanating from “the whole school of Salerno to the king of England,”\r\nnamely, Robert, son of William the Conqueror, who was cured of a wound\r\nat Salerno in 1101. The poem consisted of some two thousand lines.\r\nDr. Handerson gives the following translation of a few lines of this\r\ncurious work:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Salerno’s school in conclave high unites,\r\n    To counsel England’s king, and thus indites:\r\n    If thou to health and vigour would’st attain,\r\n    Shun mighty cares, all anger deem profane;\r\n    From heavy suppers and much wine abstain;\r\n    Nor trivial count it, after pompous fare,\r\n    To rise from table and to take the air;\r\n    Shun idle noonday slumbers, nor delay\r\n    The urgent calls of nature to obey:\r\n    These rules if thou wilt follow to the end,\r\n    Thy life to greater length thou may’st extend.”\r\n\r\nIt has been translated into English by Thomas Paynell in 1530, by John\r\nHarrington in 1607, and by Alexander Croke in 1830.\r\n\r\nThe poem is a composite work, and its form was doubtless adopted for\r\nfacility of committing to memory an important text-book of health rules.\r\n\r\nROGER, or RUGGIERO, known as Roger of Parma or of Palermo, lived about\r\n1210, was a student, and for a long time a professor in Salerno. He\r\nwas a celebrated surgeon, who practised trepanning of the sternum and\r\nstitching of the intestine. He was the first to describe a case of\r\nhernia pulmonis, to use the term seton, and to prescribe the internal\r\nuse of sea-sponge for the removal of bronchocele.[770] He knew how to\r\narrest hæmorrhage by styptics, sutures, and ligatures.\r\n\r\nHe was the earliest special writer on surgery in Italy.[771] His later\r\neditor ROLANDO exhibits an acquaintance with surgery, which shows\r\nthat, although the art had not been previously written upon in Italy,\r\nit was very well understood at Salerno. De Renzi says that some of\r\nthe operations described are trephining, the removal of polypi from\r\nthe nose, resection of the lower jaw, the operation for hernia and\r\nlithotomy. Malignant tumours of the rectum and uterus are referred\r\nto.[772]\r\n\r\nSalerno was the first school in Europe in which regular diplomas in\r\nmedicine were granted to students who had been duly instructed and had\r\npassed an examination in accordance with the requirements of the legal\r\nauthorities. The great patron of Salerno, Frederick II., in the year\r\n1240 confirmed the law of King Roger, passed in the year 1137, or as\r\nsome say in 1140, with reference to licences to practise medicine. That\r\nancient enactment was that, “Whoever from this time forth desires to\r\npractise medicine must present himself before our officials and judges,\r\nand be subject to their decision. Any one audacious enough to neglect\r\nthis shall be punished by imprisonment and confiscation of goods. This\r\ndecree has for its object the protection of the subjects of our kingdom\r\nfrom the dangers arising from the ignorance of practitioners.”[773]\r\n\r\nFrederick’s law was: “Since it is possible for a man to understand\r\nmedical science, only if he has previously learnt something of logic,\r\nwe ordain that no one shall be permitted to study medicine until he has\r\ngiven his attention to logic for three years. After these three years\r\nhe may, if he wishes, proceed to the study of medicine. In this study\r\nhe must spend five years, during which period he must also acquire a\r\nknowledge of surgery, for this forms a part of medicine. After this,\r\nbut not before, permission may be given him to practise, provided that\r\nhe passes the examination prescribed by the authorities and at the same\r\ntime produces a certificate showing that he has studied for the period\r\nrequired by the law.” “The teachers must, during this period of five\r\nyears, expound in their lectures the genuine writings of Hippocrates\r\nand Galen on the theory and practice of medicine.” “But even when the\r\nprescribed five years of medical study are passed, the doctor should\r\nnot forthwith practise on his own account, but, for a full year more\r\nhe should habitually consult an older experienced practitioner in the\r\nexercise of his profession.”\r\n\r\n“We decree that in future no one is to assume the title of doctor, to\r\nproceed to practise or to take medical charge, unless he has previously\r\nbeen found competent in the judgment of teachers at a public meeting\r\nin Salerno, has moreover by the testimony in writing of his teachers\r\nand of our officials approved himself before us or our representatives\r\nin respect of his worthiness and scientific maturity, and in pursuance\r\nof this course has received the state-licence to practise. Whoever\r\ntransgresses this law, and ventures to practise without a licence, is\r\nsubject to punishment by confiscation of property and imprisonment\r\nfor a year.” “No surgeon shall be allowed to practise until he has\r\nsubmitted certificates in writing of the teachers of the faculty of\r\nmedicine, that he has spent at least one year in the study of that part\r\nof medical science which gives skill in the practice of surgery, that\r\nin the colleges he has diligently and especially studied the anatomy of\r\nthe human body, and is also thoroughly experienced in the way in which\r\noperations are successfully performed and healing is brought about\r\nafterwards.”[774]\r\n\r\nFor centuries after this barbers in other countries practised surgery\r\nwithout let or hindrance.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was bound to give advice to the poor gratis, and to\r\ninform against apothecaries who did not make up his prescriptions in\r\naccordance with the law. The doctor’s fee in the daytime within the\r\ntown was half a gold tarenus; outside the city he could demand from\r\nthree to four tareni, exclusive of his travelling expenses.[775]\r\nDoctors were not permitted to keep drug-shops. Apothecaries were\r\nobliged to compound the medicines in conformity with the doctor’s\r\nprescriptions, and the price they charged was regulated by law.\r\nInspectors of drug-shops were appointed to visit and report. The\r\npunishment of death was imposed on the officials who neglected their\r\nduties.[776] These laws have served as the pattern for succeeding\r\nenactments for the regulation of medical education and practice.\r\n\r\nIn 1252 King Conrad created the school of Salerno a university, but\r\nKing Manfred in 1258 by his restoration of Naples University left\r\nSalerno only its medical school.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of November, 1811, a decree of the French Government put an\r\nend to the oldest school of medicine in Europe.\r\n\r\nDaremberg concludes his admirable treatise on the school of Salerno\r\nwith a pathetic account of a visit which he made to that city in 1849;\r\nhe tells how he wandered through its streets, once so active with the\r\nmovements of the students and professors of the medical sciences, and\r\nhe laments that not a single remembrance of its illustrious masters\r\nremains to remind the visitor of its ancient glories. Not a stone of\r\nthe edifices, not an echo of its traditions, not even a manuscript in\r\nany library remains to remind us of the learned and venerable men and\r\nwomen who did so much for medicine in those dark ages. A few years\r\nback I visited Salerno myself, and I found not even a decent hotel in\r\nwhich to remain a night or two. I rested at the best hostelry I could\r\nfind, and after dinner proposed to the friend who accompanied me, that\r\non the following day we should visit Pæstum and see its noble ruined\r\ntemples. As we chatted and turned over the pages of the visitors’ book,\r\nwe came across a long and doleful account of an Englishman who some few\r\nyears previously had visited Pæstum from Salerno, and was captured by\r\nbrigands; he was detained their prisoner for many weeks, and only at\r\nlast liberated, after threats of mutilation, by the payment of a heavy\r\nransom. We did not go to Pæstum; we left Salerno early the following\r\nmorning and went to Amalfi. The hotel was gloomy and crumbling into\r\ndecay, the rooms were all empty, the landlord was suggestive of the\r\nhost in some of the old stories of our boyish days. Thus has Salerno\r\nfallen. Most travellers now make La Cava their headquarters, and do not\r\nstay at Salerno at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE THIRTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n The Crusades.—Astrology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crusades were of the highest importance to the development of\r\nWestern civilization; they brought the European world into contact\r\nwith the ancient wisdom of the East, they greatly stimulated commerce,\r\naroused a spirit of restlessness and inquiry, and thus enlarged men’s\r\nminds, stimulated them to adventure and heroic deeds, improved the\r\nart of war and the invention of arms, etc. By bringing the Crusaders\r\ninto contact with the Saracens many new medicines were introduced into\r\npractice; physicians followed the armies to the East, and thus had\r\nopportunities of studying the healing art as practised in the midst\r\nof ancient civilizations. To a great extent the present advantages we\r\nenjoy are due to the influence of the Crusades, which brought to Europe\r\nmany arts and sciences we should not have otherwise learned.\r\n\r\nOne of the evil consequences of the Crusades was the introduction into\r\nEurope of epidemic diseases and contagious disorders which have always\r\nhad their home in the East. Thus were introduced the plague, leprosy,\r\nand the disorders which are bred of filth and promiscuous living.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century very few who possessed either medical or\r\nsurgical skill were not priests or monks, chiefly mendicants. The\r\nprofession became very lucrative, and so many monks devoted themselves\r\nto the healing art that they neglected their spiritual duties, and were\r\nconsequently forbidden to leave their monasteries for a longer period\r\nthan two months at a time.[777] In this century astrology was closely\r\nrelated to the practice of medicine. It was believed that an intimate\r\nassociation existed between the heavenly bodies and those of men, and\r\nno cure could be attempted without consulting the astrological oracle.\r\n\r\nM. Jules Andrieu says that medical science, “like the other\r\nsciences, began by being astrological. The first encyclopædia was\r\nastrology.”[778] Certainly it was one of the modes most anciently\r\nand universally practised for discovering the most important things\r\nrelating to the lives and fortunes of those who believed in it. It was\r\nflattering to men to believe that the heavenly bodies are interested\r\nin their welfare, and the events of life were awaited with resignation\r\nand composure by those who believed they were regulated by the stars\r\nin their courses; they applied themselves therefore to diagrams and\r\ncalculations to learn the simplest and most obvious details of their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nM. Littré, member of the Institute and the Academy of Medicine at\r\nParis, in his _Fragment de Médecine Rétrospective_,[779] describes\r\nseven “miracles” which took place in France at the end of the\r\nthirteenth century at the tomb of St. Louis. He states the simple\r\nfacts as written in the chronicles of the period. He does not dispute\r\nthem, does not ridicule nor ignore them, but endeavours to give a\r\npathological interpretation of them. He notices in the first place that\r\nat the moment of cure the patient felt a sharp pain—the part affected\r\nseemed to be stretched or touched, and sometimes a sort of cracking\r\nsensation in the bone was experienced, then movements became possible,\r\nalthough the lengthening of the limb and the possibility of moving it\r\nfreely were not experienced immediately; the cure was not so sudden, a\r\nperiod of weakness, long or short, always followed the miracle, and the\r\npart only gradually regained its use. The cracking of the bone is just\r\nwhat the surgeon finds when he moves a joint which has become fixed by\r\ndisuse; without breaking down these adhesions, he can do nothing to\r\nrestore the articulation. In cases of rheumatic paralysis a similar\r\nstate of things is observed. Of course in the accounts of the healing\r\nat the tomb of St. Louis we expect to find errors and exaggerations\r\ndue to the preoccupation and ignorance of those who wrote the reports,\r\nbut we at once recognise the cracking and the pain as genuine\r\npathological details; we should not expect a natural cure without\r\nthese symptoms. To what shall we attribute them? M. Littré gives the\r\nexplanation in the words of M. le docteur Onimus, published in _La\r\nPhilosophic positive sur la Vibration nerveuse_.[780] The ascending\r\naction or vibration expresses the influence of the physical on the\r\nmoral; the descending action or vibration expresses the influence of\r\nthe moral on the physical. In these cases it is the descending action\r\nwhich we have to consider. This action is exerted on the muscular\r\nportion of the affected part; it contracts energetically; it breaks\r\ndown the pathological adhesions if they exist; it restores the bones\r\nviolently to their place; this done, the patient is in a condition to\r\nuse the limb, but not without passing through a period of debility\r\nwhich requires time for recovery. It is a violent extension produced\r\nby muscular contractions. Surgery has frequently to break down such\r\nadhesions and destroy false anchyloses. Here the force is not exerted\r\nby a strange hand, but by an influence which is exerted on the muscles\r\nthemselves, and this in a far more beneficent manner than surgery can\r\nafford. What is the exciting cause of these energetic contractions?\r\nThat which we find in all miracles of this sort—a strong persuasion, a\r\ncomplete confidence. Under a profound emotion born of these sentiments,\r\nthe patient, feeling that the cure was in the extension of the part,\r\nhad a belief which he could understand. Of course such faith is not\r\npossible in every case. On one side there must be the mental condition\r\nwhich can receive in its fulness the emotion born of persuasion and\r\nconfidence, and on the other that the lesions must be susceptible of\r\ncure. To a certain degree there are lesions which escape all this sort\r\nof treatment. Herbert Spencer points out[781] that muscular power fails\r\nwith flagging emotions or desires which lapse into indifference, and\r\nconversely that intense feeling or passion confers a great increase in\r\nmuscular force. It is brain and feeling generated by the mind which\r\ngive strength to the person who thinks strongly.\r\n\r\nALBERTUS MAGNUS (1193-1280), one of the greatest of the schoolmen,\r\ncombined with his religious speculations so great a knowledge of\r\nphysical science and mechanics that he was reputed as a sorcerer. He\r\nconstructed automata, some of which could speak; wrote on anatomy,\r\nphysiology, botany, chemistry, astronomy, magnetism, acclimatization\r\nof plants and animals, etc. He digested, interpreted, and systematized\r\nthe whole of the writings of Aristotle in accordance with the teaching\r\nof the Church. He was called, not only “Albert the Great,” but “the\r\nUniversal doctor.” To his labours and those of THOMAS AQUINAS may be\r\nexplained the reverence for ARISTOTLE entertained by the clergy of the\r\nRoman and Anglican churches even to the present day.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS AQUINAS (1225 _circ._-1274), was the great Dominican theologian\r\nwho wrote the _Summa Theologiæ_. In his famous work he incidentally\r\ndealt with medical and physiological questions. The source of all\r\nmotion is the heart. The soul is created anew in each conception.\r\nMoisture, heat, and æther alone are necessary for the generation of an\r\nindividual; the lower animals originate even from putrefying matter. He\r\nwrote commentaries on the works of Aristotle, and derived many of his\r\nscientific ideas from this great master. The biology of St. Thomas, as\r\nmay be imagined, is exceedingly feeble, yet it too often forms the only\r\nknowledge of the subject which continental clergymen possess.\r\n\r\nRAYMOND LULLI (1235-1315) was a man of great intellect, who sought the\r\nsecrets of transmutation of metals and the philosopher’s stone. He\r\nwas a bold thinker, an astrologer, and a physician of great repute.\r\nNaturally he was accused of magic. His acquaintance with the Arabians\r\ndirected his mind to the study of chemistry. He wrote on medical\r\nsubjects, the titles of his best known works being _De Pulsibus et\r\nUrinis_, _De Medicina Theorica et Practica_, _De Aquis et Oleis_.\r\n\r\nROGER BACON (1214-1298). By theologians he was believed to be in\r\nleague with the devil, because of his belief in astrology and his\r\nscientific attainments. It is probable that his reputed invention of\r\ncertain optical instruments was really due to his acquaintance with\r\nArabic, as the Arabians were familiar with the camera, burning glass,\r\nand microscope, which have been attributed to him. Neither is it the\r\nfact that he invented gunpowder, as is usually supposed. Bacon wrote\r\nvoluminously on theology, philosophy, and science. Although he believed\r\nin astrology and the philospher’s stone, he had a true scientific idea\r\nof the value of experiment, which forcibly reminds us of the Francis\r\nBacon which future ages would reveal.\r\n\r\n“Experimental science,” he said, “has three great prerogatives over\r\nall other sciences: (1) it verifies their conclusions by direct\r\nexperiments; (2) it discovers truths which they could never reach; (3)\r\nit investigates the secrets of nature, and opens to us a knowledge of\r\npast and future.”[782] As an instance of his method, Bacon gives an\r\ninvestigation into the phenomena of the rainbow, which is doubtless a\r\nvery remarkable example of inductive research.\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon proved himself far in advance of his time by his insistence\r\nof the supremacy of experiment. So different was his mental attitude in\r\nthis regard from the temper of his time that Whewell finds it difficult\r\nto conceive how such a character could then exist.[783] He learned\r\nmuch from Arabian writers, but certainly not from them did he learn\r\nto emancipate himself from the bondage to Aristotle which everywhere\r\nenslaved them. Doubtless he learned from Aristotle himself to call no\r\nman master in science, for the Stagyrite declared that all knowledge\r\nmust come from observation, and that science must be collected from\r\nfacts by induction.[784] Probably the truth about Aristotle is that\r\nBacon’s objections were directed against the Latin translations of\r\nthe Greek philosopher, which were very bad ones. Of both Avicenna\r\nand Averroes he speaks respectfully, and it is doubted whether any\r\npassages in Bacon’s works can be construed into opposition to\r\nAristotle’s own authority.[785]\r\n\r\nWood says[786] that Roger Bacon was accounted the fourth in order of\r\nthe chief chemists the world had ever produced, their names being\r\n(1) Hermes Trismegistus, the first chemist, (2) Geber, (3) Morienus\r\nRomanus, (4) Roger Bacon, (5) Raymond Lulli, (6) Paracelsus.\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon made such prodigious chemical experiments at Oxford and\r\nParis “that none could be convinced to the contrary but that he dealt\r\nwith the devil.”\r\n\r\nJEAN PITARD (1228-1315) founded the surgical society in France,\r\nwhich exercised a very important influence on the development of the\r\nhealing art in that country, under the title of the “College de Saint\r\nCôme.”[787] At a time when surgery of the lower character was practised\r\nby barbers, this important corporation of educated men broke off from\r\nthe inferior association and combined to form an academy of the higher\r\nsurgery.\r\n\r\nPETER DE MAHARNCOURT was an Oxford student, so “excellent in chemical\r\nexperiments that he was instituted _Dominus Experimentorum_.”[788]\r\nHe not only worked in metallurgy, but interested himself in “the\r\nexperiments of old women, their charms, magical spells, and verses\r\nthat they used to repeat when they applied or gave anything to their\r\npatients.”\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS MYREPSUS (_circ._ A.D. 1250), “Actuarius,” _i.e._\r\nphysician-in-ordinary, wrote a vast work on materia medica, containing\r\n2,656 prescriptions for every disease, real or imaginary, which\r\nafflicts our race. He had studied at Salerno.\r\n\r\nJOHN ACTUARIUS (_circ._ 1283) was a medical genius in advance of his\r\nage. He wrote a useful materia medica and a treatise on the kidney\r\nsecretion, in which he explains the use of a graduated glass for\r\nestimating the amount of sediments, which he classifies according to\r\ntheir colours. He appeared, says Haeser, “like the last flickerings of\r\na dying flame” just before the Turks destroyed the glorious work of the\r\nGreeks in the civilized world.\r\n\r\nIn Edward the First’s reign the king’s physician had twelve pence per\r\nday for his expenses in visiting the Countess of Gloucester, the king’s\r\ndaughter, when she was ill.[789]\r\n\r\nThe art of poisoning was brought to considerable perfection in the\r\nMiddle Ages, and there is abundant evidence of the fact that women were\r\ncommonly agents in it.[790]\r\n\r\nIn Edward the Third’s reign the ladies of the household were both\r\nnurses and doctors. Regular practitioners were few, and the mistress\r\nof the house and her maidens were compelled to do the best they could\r\nin their absence. Medicinal herbs were cultivated in every garden, and\r\nwere either dried or made into decoctions and kept ready for use. Many\r\nof these fair practitioners were reputed to be very skilful in medical\r\npractice. Chaucer, in the “Nonne-Prestes Tale,” has left a faithful\r\npicture of the domestic medicine of the period in the character of Dame\r\nPertelot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n Revival of Human Anatomy.—Famous Physicians of the Century.—Domestic\r\n Medicine in Chaucer.—Fellowship of the Barbers and Surgeons.—The Black\r\n Death.—The Dancing Mania.—Pharmacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIVAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nBrighter days dawned for medical science after the close of the\r\nthirteenth century, up to which era the Saracenic learning prevailed.\r\nWhile human dissections were impossible, the sciences of anatomy and\r\nphilosophy had made no advance beyond the point at which they were\r\nleft by Galen, and as he dissected only animals they were necessarily\r\nleft in a very imperfect state. It is not known precisely when human\r\ndissection was revived; probably the school of Salerno, under the\r\ninfluence of Frederick II., has a right to the honour. In 1308,\r\nhowever, we find the senate of Venice decreeing that a body should be\r\ndissected annually,[791] and it is known that such dissections took\r\nplace at Bologna in 1300. We have, however, nothing very definite on\r\nthe subject till a few years later. Italy gave birth to the first great\r\nanatomist of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe father of modern anatomy was MONDINO, who taught in Bologna about\r\nthe year 1315. Under his cultivation “the science first began to rise\r\nfrom the ashes in which it had been buried.”[792] His demonstrations of\r\nthe different parts of the human body at once attracted the notice of\r\nthe medical profession of Europe to the school of Bologna. He died in\r\n1325. Though he had a penetrating faculty of observation, he was not\r\naltogether original, as he copied Galen and the Arabians. He divided\r\nthe body into three cavities: the upper, containing the animal members;\r\nthe lower, the natural members; and the middle, the spiritual members.\r\nHis anatomy of the heart is wonderfully accurate, and he came very near\r\nto the discovery of the circulation of the blood.[793] He described\r\nseven pairs of nerves at the base of the brain, and was evidently\r\nacquainted with the anatomy of that organ.\r\n\r\nHe is said to have had the assistance of a young lady, ALASSANDRA\r\nGILIANI, as prosector. Anatomical demonstrations in those days were,\r\nat the best, very imperfect. The demonstrator did not actually himself\r\ndissect; this was done by a barber-surgeon with a razor, the lecturer\r\nmerely standing by and pointing out the objects of interest to the\r\nstudents with his staff. Nor did the process occupy much time; four\r\nlessons served to explain the mysteries of the human frame: the first\r\nwas on the abdomen, the second on the organs of the chest, the third\r\non the brain, and the fourth on the extremities.[794] The bodies were\r\nburied, or placed in running or boiling water, to soften the tissues\r\nand facilitate their examination. Dissections first took place at\r\nPrague in 1348, Montpellier after 1376, Strasburg, 1517. In Italy,\r\nsometimes, a condemned criminal was first stabbed in prison by the\r\nexecutioner, and then conveyed at once to the dissecting room, for the\r\nuse of the doctors.\r\n\r\nThe most famous physicians of this period were:—\r\n\r\nPETRUS APONO, or PIETRO OF ABANO (1250-1315), a famous physician, who\r\nlived at Abano near Padua, and who had studied medicine and other\r\nsciences at Padua and Paris. He travelled in Greece and other parts,\r\nacquired a knowledge of the Greek language, and was a devoted student\r\nof the works of Averroes. He endeavoured to mediate between the Arabian\r\nand the Greek physicians in their controversies on medicine, and wrote\r\nwith that view his work, entitled the _Conciliator differentiarum\r\nphilosophorum et precipue medicorum_. He knew enough of physiology to\r\nbe aware that the brain is the source of the nerves, and the heart that\r\nof all the blood-vessels. He meddled with astrology, and was accused of\r\npractising magic, of possessing the philosopher’s stone. He was found\r\nguilty on his second trial by the Inquisition; but as he died before\r\nthe trial was completed, he was merely burned in effigy.\r\n\r\nJACOB DE DONDIS (1298-1359) was a physician, who was a professor at\r\nPadua, and was famous as the author of an herbal with plates containing\r\ndescriptions of simple medicines.\r\n\r\nARNOLD OF VILLA NOVA (1235-1312), physician, alchemist, and astrologer,\r\ndid much to advance chemical science, and whose work, the _Breviarium\r\nPracticæ_, is not a mere compilation. He advised his pupils, when they\r\nfailed to find out what was the matter with their patients, to declare\r\nthat there was “some obstruction of the liver,”—a practice much in\r\nvogue even in the present day. He was the first to administer brandy,\r\nwhich he called the elixir of life (Baas). He discovered the art of\r\npreparing distilled spirits (Thomson).\r\n\r\nCollections of medical cases first began to be preserved in an\r\nintelligible form in the thirteenth century; they were called\r\n_consilia_. Those by FULGINEUS (before 1348), by MONTAGNANA (died\r\n1470), and by BAVERIUS DE BAVERIIS, of Imola (about 1450), are said to\r\nbe interesting.[795]\r\n\r\nGORDONIUS was a Scottish professor at Montpellier, who in 1307 wrote\r\nthe _Practica seu Lilium Medicinæ_; it went through several editions,\r\nand was translated into French and Hebrew.\r\n\r\nSYLVATICUS (_ob._ 1342) wrote a sort of medical glossary and dictionary.\r\n\r\nGILBERTUS ANGLICANUS (about 1290) wrote a compendium of medicine, also\r\ncalled _Rosa Anglicana_, a work of European reputation, said to contain\r\ngood observations on leprosy.\r\n\r\nJOHN OF GADDESDEN was an Oxford man and a court physician, who between\r\n1305 and 1317 wrote the _Rosa Anglica seu Practica Medicinæ_,—a work\r\nwhich, though of little merit, remained popular up to the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Some of his remedies are very curious. For loss of memory\r\nhe prescribed the heart of a nightingale, and he was a firm believer\r\nin the efficacy of the king’s touch for scrofula. For small-pox he\r\nprescribed the following treatment, as soon as the eruption appeared:\r\n“Cause the whole body of your patient to be wrapped in scarlet cloth,\r\nor in any other red cloth, and command everything about the bed to\r\nbe made red. This is an excellent cure.” Again, for epilepsy, the\r\nmethod of cure was as follows: “Because there are many children and\r\nothers afflicted with the epilepsy, who cannot take medicines, let the\r\nfollowing experiment be tried, which I have found to be effectual,\r\nwhether the patient was a demoniac, a lunatic, or an epileptic. When\r\nthe patient and his parents have fasted three days, let them conduct\r\nhim to a church. If he be of a proper age, and of his right senses, let\r\nhim confess. Then let him hear Mass on Friday, and also on Saturday.\r\nOn Sunday let a good and religious priest read over the head of the\r\npatient, in the church, the gospel which is read in September, in the\r\ntime of vintage, after the feast of the Holy Cross. After this, let\r\nthe priest write the same gospel devoutly, and let the patient wear it\r\nabout his neck, and he shall be cured. The gospel is, ‘This kind goeth\r\nnot out but by prayer and fasting.’” These quotations are both from the\r\n_Medical Rose_; and as the author was at the head of his profession,\r\nnumbered princes amongst his patients, and was extolled by writers of\r\nthe time, it doubtless fairly represents the practice of the period.\r\nThe medicine of the period embraced the demon theory of disease and the\r\nbelief in the efficacy of amulets, or more correctly of characts.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC MEDICINE IN CHAUCER’S TIME.\r\n\r\nCHAUCER (1340-1400), in the _Nonnes Preestes Tale_, tells us how in his\r\ntime people took care of their health by attention to diet; and how,\r\nwhen folk were sick, and doctors not handy, nor medicines to be had at\r\nthe chemist’s close by, the wise women were able, not only to prescribe\r\nskilfully, but to supply the requisite medicines from their own store\r\nor garden.\r\n\r\n    “A poure widewe, somdel stoupen in age,\r\n    Was whilom dwelling in a narwe cotage\r\n    Beside a grove, stonding in a dale.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Hire diete was accordant to hire cote.\r\n    Repletion ne made hire never sike;\r\n    Attempre diete was all hire physike\r\n    And exercise, & hertes suffisance.\r\n    The goute let hire nothing for to dance,\r\n    No apoplexie shente not hire hed,\r\n    No win ne dranke she, neyther white ne red.\r\n\r\n    ‘Now, sire,’ quod she, ‘whan we flee fro the bemes,\r\n    For Goddes love, as take som laxatif;\r\n    Up peril of my soule, & of my lif,\r\n    I conseil you the best, I wol not lie.\r\n    That both of coler, & of melancolie\r\n    Ye purge you; and for ye shul not tarie,\r\n    Though in this toun be non apotecarie,\r\n    I shal myself two herbes techen you,\r\n    That shal be for your hele, & for your prow;\r\n    And in our yerde, the herbes shal I finde,\r\n    The which han of hir propretee by kinde\r\n    To purgen you benethe, & eke above.\r\n    Sire, forgete not this for Goddes love;\r\n    Ye ben ful colerike of complexion;\r\n    Ware that the Sonne in his ascention\r\n    Ne find you not replete of humours hote:\r\n    And if it do, I dare wel lay a grote,\r\n    That ye shul han a fever tertiane,\r\n    Or elles an ague, that may be your bane.\r\n    A day or two ye shal han digestives\r\n    Of wormes, or ye take your laxatives,\r\n    Of laureole, centaurie, & fumetere,\r\n    Or elles of ellebor, that groweth there,\r\n    Of catapuce, or of gaitre-beries,\r\n    Or herbe ive growing in our yerd, that mery is;\r\n    Picke hem right as they grow, and ete hem in.’”\r\n\r\nChaucer has indicated for us, in his Prologue to the _Canterbury\r\nTales_, who were the great medical authors studied by English\r\nphysicians of the period.\r\n\r\nBesides Æsculapius, whose works certainly could not have reached the\r\n“Doctour of Physicke,” he read Dioscorides, the famous writer on\r\nMateria Medica (A.D. 40-90). Rufus (of Ephesus, about A.D. 50). Old\r\nHippocras = Hippocrates. Hali = Ali Abbas (died 994). Gallien = Galen.\r\nSerapion; there were two, the elder and the younger. Rasis = Rhazes\r\n(A.D. 850-923). Avicen = Avicenna (died 1170). Averriois = Averroes\r\n(died 1198). Damascene = Janus Damascenus, _alias_ Mesue the elder\r\n(780-857). Constantin = Constantinus Africanus (1018-1085). Bernard\r\n= Bernardus Provincialis (about 1155). Gatisden = John of Gaddesden\r\n(about 1305). Gilbertin = Gilbert of England (about 1290).\r\n\r\n“His study was but little on the Bible,” says the poet, who also\r\nintimates that as gold in physic is a cordial, he was partial to fees.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOWSHIP OF BARBERS AND SURGEONS.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of September, 1348, says Anthony à Wood,[796] “appeared\r\nbefore Mr. John Northwode, D.D., Chancellor of the University of\r\nOxford, John Bradey, Barber, Richard Fell, Barber Surgeon, Thomas\r\nBillye, Waferer, and with them the whole Company and Fellowship of\r\nBarbers within the precincts of Oxford, and intending thenceforward to\r\njoin and bind themselves in amity and love, brought with them certain\r\nordinations and statutes drawn up in writings for the weal of the Craft\r\nof Barbers, desiring the said Chancellor that he would peruse and\r\ncorrect them, and when he had so done, to put the University seal to\r\nthem. Thus the Barbers of Oxford were formed into a Corporation, one of\r\ntheir ordinations being that no man nor servant of the Craft of Barbers\r\nor Surgery should reveal any _infirmity_ or _secret_ disease they have,\r\nto their customers or patients. Of which, if any one should be found\r\nguilty, then he was to pay 20_s._, whereof 6_s._ 8_d._ was to go to Our\r\nLady’s box, 6_s._ 8_d._ to the Chancellor, or in his absence, to the\r\nCommissary, and 6._s._ 8_d._ to the Proctors.” The Barbers, Surgeons,\r\nWaferers, and makers of singing bread were all of the same fellowship.\r\nThey all continued in one society till the year 1500, when the Cappers\r\nor Knitters of Caps, sometimes called Capper-Hurrers, were united to\r\nthem.[797] In 1551 the Barbers and Waferers laid aside their charter\r\nand took one in the name of the City; but Wood says they lived without\r\nany ordination, statutes, or charter till 1675, when they received a\r\ncharter from the University.[798]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK DEATH.\r\n\r\nA great pestilence desolated Asia, Europe, and Africa in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, which was known as _The Black Death_. Its origin was\r\noriental, and it was distinguished by boils and tumours of the glands,\r\naccompanied by black spots. Many patients became stupefied and fell\r\ninto a deep sleep; they became speechless, their tongues were black,\r\nand their thirst unquenchable. Their sufferings were so terrible that\r\nmany in despair committed suicide. Those who waited upon the sick\r\ncaught the disease, and in Constantinople many houses were bereft of\r\ntheir last inhabitant. Guy de Chauliac, the physician (born about\r\n1300), bravely defied the plague when it raged in Avignon for six or\r\neight weeks, although the form which it there assumed was distinguished\r\nby the pestilential breath of the patients who expectorated blood,\r\nso that the near vicinity of the persons who were sick was certain\r\ndeath. The courageous de Chauliac, when all his colleagues had fled\r\nthe city, boldly and constantly assisted the sufferers. He saw the\r\nplague twice in Avignon—in 1348, and twelve years later. Boccacio, who\r\nwas in Florence when it raged in that city, has described it in the\r\n_Decameron_. No medicine brought relief; not only men, but animals\r\nsickened with it and rapidly expired. Boccacio himself saw two hogs,\r\non the rags of a person who had died of the plague, fall dead, after\r\nstaggering a little as if they had been poisoned. Multitudes of other\r\nanimals fell victims to the epidemic in the same way. In France many\r\nyoung and strong persons died as soon as they were struck, as if by\r\nlightning. The plague spread over England with terrible rapidity. It\r\nfirst broke out in the county of Dorset; advancing to Devonshire and\r\nSomersetshire, it reached Bristol, Gloucester, Oxford, and London. The\r\nannals of contemporaries record the awful fact that throughout the land\r\nonly a tenth of the population remained alive. The contagion spread\r\nfrom England to Norway. Poland and Russia suffered later in a similar\r\nmanner, although the disease did not always manifest itself in the same\r\nform in every case. Only two medical descriptions of the disease have\r\ncome down to us—one by GUY DE CHAULIAC, the other by RAYMOND CHALIN\r\nDE VINARIO. Chauliac notices the fatal coughing of blood; Vinario in\r\naddition describes fluxes of blood from the bowels, and bleeding at the\r\nnose. What were the causes which produced so dreadful a plague, it is\r\nimpossible to discover with certainty.\r\n\r\nDr. Hecker, to whose work on the subject[799] I am indebted for\r\nthe information concerning it, says that “mighty revolutions in\r\nthe organism of the earth, of which we have credible information,\r\nhad preceded it. From China to the Atlantic the foundations of the\r\nearth were shaken, throughout Asia and Europe the atmosphere was in\r\ncommotion, and endangered, by its baneful influence, both vegetable and\r\nanimal life.”\r\n\r\nIn 1337, 4,000,000 of people perished by famine in China in the\r\nneighbourhood of Kiang alone. Floods, famines, and earthquakes were\r\nfrequent, both in Asia and Europe. In Cyprus a pestiferous wind\r\nspread a poisonous odour before an earthquake shook the island to its\r\nfoundations, and many of the inhabitants fell down suddenly and expired\r\nin dreadful agonies after inhaling the noxious gases. German chemists\r\nstate that a thick stinking mist advancing from the east spread over\r\nItaly in thousands of places, and vast chasms opened in the earth which\r\nexhaled the most noxious vapours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DANCING MANIA.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1374 a strange delusion arose in Germany, a convulsion\r\ninfuriating the human frame, and afflicting the people for more than\r\ntwo centuries. It was called the dance of St. John or of St. Vitus, and\r\nthose affected by it performed a wild dance while screaming and foaming\r\nwith fury. The sight of the afflicted communicated the mania to the\r\nobservers, and the demoniacal epidemic soon spread over the whole of\r\nGermany and the neighbouring countries to the north-west.\r\n\r\nBands of men and women went about the streets forming circles hand in\r\nhand, and danced madly for hours together, until they fell in a state\r\nof exhaustion to the ground. They complained, when in this state, of\r\ngreat oppression, and groaned as if in extreme pain, till they were\r\ntightly bandaged round their waists with cloths, when they speedily\r\nrecovered. While dancing they were insensible to external impressions,\r\nbut their minds were in a condition of great exaltation, and they\r\nsaw in their fancies heavenly beings and visitants from the world of\r\nspirits. At Aix-la Chapelle, at Cologne, and in 1418 at Strasburg, the\r\n“Dancing Plague” infatuated the people by thousands.[800]\r\n\r\nHecker attributes the madness to the recollection of the crimes\r\ncommitted by the people during the visitation of the Black Plague,\r\nto the previous inundations, the wretched condition of the people of\r\nWestern and Southern Germany in consequence of the incessant feuds\r\nof the barons, to hunger, bad food, and the insecurity of the times.\r\nDancing plagues had often occurred before; in 1237 more than a hundred\r\nchildren were suddenly seized by it at Erfurt, and several other dates\r\nare given by historians for similar occurrences. Physicians did not\r\nattempt the cure of the malady, but left it to the priests, as it was\r\nconsidered to be due to demoniacal possession.\r\n\r\nHecker says[801] that Paracelsus in the sixteenth century was the first\r\nphysician who made a study of St. Vitus’s dance. The great reformer\r\nof medicine said: “We will not, however, admit that the saints have\r\npower to inflict diseases, and that these ought to be named after them,\r\nalthough many there are who, in their theology, lay great stress on\r\nthis supposition, ascribing them rather to God than to nature, which is\r\nbut idle talk. We dislike such nonsensical gossip, as is not supported\r\nby symptoms, but only by faith, a thing which is not human, whereon the\r\ngods themselves set no value.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPHARMACY.\r\n\r\nThe drug dealers of the Middle Ages had little or no relationship to\r\nour apothecaries and pharmacists.\r\n\r\nThe word _apotheca_ meant a store or warehouse, and its proprietor was\r\nthe _apothecarius_. From the word _apotheca_ the Italians derive their\r\n_bottéga_, and the French their _boutique_, a shop. The thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth century apothecary, therefore, was altogether a different\r\nperson from our own. It is probable that the Arabian physicians about\r\nthe time of Avenzoar, in the eleventh century, began to abandon to\r\ndruggists the business of compounding their prescriptions; the custom\r\nwould then have spread to Spain, Sicily, and South Italy, where the\r\nSaracen possessions lay. This explains how so many Arabic terms became\r\nintroduced into chemical nomenclature, such as _alembic_. Persons\r\nwho prepared preserves, etc., were called _confectionarii_, and they\r\nmade up medicines, and those who kept medicine shops were called\r\n_stationarii_. The physicians at Salerno had the inspection of the\r\n_stationes_.\r\n\r\nBeckmann finds no proof that physicians at that time sent their\r\nprescriptions to the _stationes_ to be dispensed. He says: “It appears\r\nrather that the _confectionarii_ prepared medicines from a general set\r\nof prescriptions legally authorized, and that the physicians selected\r\nfrom these medicines kept ready for use, such as they thought most\r\nproper to be administered to their patients.”[802]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n Faith Healing.—Charms and Astrology in Medicine.—The Revival of\r\n Learning.—The Humanists.—Cabalism and Theology.—The Study of Natural\r\n History.—The Sweating Sickness.—Tarantism.—Quarantine.—High Position\r\n of Oxford University.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAITH-HEALING.\r\n\r\nMedicine in mediæval Christian history is simply the history of\r\nmiracles of healing wrought by saints or by their relics. Bede’s\r\n_Ecclesiastical History_, for example, is full of saintly cures\r\nand marvels of healing. The study of medical science under such\r\ncircumstances could have had but little encouragement. Doctors were but\r\nof secondary importance where holy relics and saintly personages were\r\neverywhere present to cure.\r\n\r\nIn the Catholic Church there are special saints who are invoked for\r\nalmost every sort of disease.\r\n\r\nSt. Agatha, against sore breast.\r\n\r\nSt. Agnan and St. Tignan, against scald head.\r\n\r\nSt. Anthony, against inflammations.\r\n\r\nSt. Apollonia, against toothache.\r\n\r\nSt. Avertin, against lunacy.\r\n\r\nSt. Benedict, against the stone, and also for poisons.\r\n\r\nSt. Blaise, against the quinsey, bones sticking in the throat, etc.\r\n\r\nSt. Christopher and St. Mark, against sudden death.\r\n\r\nSt. Clara, against sore eyes.\r\n\r\nSt. Erasmus, against the colic.\r\n\r\nSt. Eutrope, against dropsy.\r\n\r\nSt. Genow and St. Maur, against the gout.\r\n\r\nSt. Germanus, against children’s diseases.\r\n\r\nSt. Giles and St. Hyacinth, against sterility.\r\n\r\nSt. Hubert, against hydrophobia.\r\n\r\nSt. Job and St. Fiage, against syphilis.\r\n\r\nSt. John, against epilepsy and poison.\r\n\r\nSt. Lawrence, against diseases of the back and shoulders.\r\n\r\nSt. Liberius, against the stone and fistula.\r\n\r\nSt. Maine, against the scab.\r\n\r\nSt. Margaret and St. Edine, against danger in child-bed.\r\n\r\nSt. Martin, against the itch.\r\n\r\nSt. Marus, against palsy and convulsions.\r\n\r\nSt. Otilia and St. Juliana, against sore eyes and the headache.\r\n\r\nSt. Pernel, against the ague.\r\n\r\nSt. Petronilla, St. Apollonia, and St. Lucy, against the toothache.\r\n\r\n—— and St. Genevieve, against fevers.\r\n\r\nSt. Phaire, against hæmorrhoids.\r\n\r\nSt. Quintam, against coughs.\r\n\r\nSt. Rochus and St. Sebastian, against the plague.\r\n\r\nSt. Romanus, against demoniacal possession.\r\n\r\nSt. Ruffin, against madness.\r\n\r\nSt. Sigismund, against fevers and agues.\r\n\r\nSt. Valentin, against epilepsy.\r\n\r\nSt. Venise, against chlorosis.\r\n\r\nSt. Vitus, against madness and poisons.\r\n\r\nSt. Wallia and Wallery, against the stone.\r\n\r\nSt. Wolfgang, against lameness.\r\n\r\nPettigrew[803] gives the above list, but probably it might be\r\nconsiderably extended.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARMS AND ASTROLOGY.\r\n\r\nA curious little MS. volume was discovered amongst the MSS. at Loseley,\r\nwhich contained a Latin grammar, a Treatise on Astrology, various\r\nmedical recipes and precautions, with forms for making wills. It\r\nhad probably been a monk’s manual. The writing was the character of\r\nthe fifteenth century. Some of the medical recipes and astrological\r\nprecautions are said to be taken from “Master Galien (Galen), leche,”\r\nthus:—“_For all manner of fevers._ Take iii drops of a woman’s mylke yt\r\nnorseth a knave childe, and do it in a hennes egge that ys sedentere\r\n(or sitting), and let hym suppe it up when the evyl takes hym.—_For\r\nhym—that may not slepe._ Take and wryte yese wordes into leves of\r\nlether: Ismael! Ismael! adjuro te per Angelum Michaelum ut soporetur\r\nhomo iste; and lay this under his bed, so yt he wot not yerof, and\r\nuse it all-way lytell, and lytell, as he have nede yerto.” Under the\r\nhead,—“_Here begyneth ye waxingge of ye mone, and declareth in dyvers\r\ntymes to let blode, whiche be gode._ In the furste begynynge of the\r\nmone it is profetable to yche man to be letten blode; ye ix of the\r\nmone, neyther be (by) nyght ne by day, it is not good.”[804]\r\n\r\nOne Simon Trippe, a physician, writing to a patient to excuse himself\r\nfor not being able to visit him, says: “As for my comming to you\r\nupon Wensday next, verely my promise be past to an old pacient of\r\nmine, a very good gentlewoman, one Mrs. Clerk, wch now lieth in great\r\nextremity. I cannot possibly be with you till Thursday. On Fryday and\r\nSaterday the signe wilbe in the heart; on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday,\r\nin the stomake; during wch tyme it wilbe no good dealing with your\r\nordinary physicke untill Wensday come sevenight at the nearest, and\r\nfrom that time forwards for 15 or 16 days passing good.”[805]\r\n\r\nThis is very similar to what we find in Bede’s _Ecclesiastical\r\nHistory_, where (A.D. 686) “a holy Bishop having been asked to bless\r\na sick maiden, asked ‘when she had been bled?’ and being told that it\r\nwas on the fourth day of the moon, said: ‘You did very indiscreetly and\r\nunskilfully to bleed her on the fourth day of the moon; for I remember\r\nthat Archbishop Theodore, of blessed memory, said that bleeding at that\r\ntime was very dangerous, when the light of the moon and the tide of the\r\nocean is increasing; and what can I do to the girl if she is like to\r\ndie?’”[806]\r\n\r\nHolinshed says[807] that a lewd fellow, in the sixth year of Richard\r\nthe Second, “took upon him to be skilful in physick and astronomy,”\r\npredicted that the rise of a “pestilent planet” would cause much\r\nsickness and death amongst the people; but as the pestilence did not\r\nappear, the fellow was punished severely. Stow records[808] that one\r\nRoger Bolingbroke, in the second year of Henry the Sixth (1423), was\r\naccused of necromancy and endeavouring by diabolical arts to consume\r\nthe king’s person. He was seized with all his instruments of magic\r\nand set upon a scaffold in St. Paul’s Churchyard, where he abjured\r\nhis diabolical arts in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nand many other prelates. The punishment for witchcraft was hanging or\r\nburning alive.\r\n\r\nStrutt says[809] that it was extremely dangerous in those days to\r\npretend to any supernatural knowledge; as every one believed in the\r\ninfluence of malignant spirits, and that they were obedient to the call\r\nof the necromancers. “No contagion could happen among the cattle of a\r\nfarmer, but the devil was the cause, and some conjurer was sought out;\r\nso that if any wretched vagabonds of fortune-tellers could be found,\r\nthey were instantly accused of this horrid crime, and perhaps burnt\r\nalive.”[810]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REVIVAL OF LEARNING.\r\n\r\nPOPE NICHOLAS V. (1389-1455) was a man of great intellectual\r\nsympathies. He was not devoted to any one branch of learning, but\r\nwas “a well-informed _dillettante_, wandering at will wherever his\r\nfancy led him.” Æneas Sylvius said of him: “From his youth he has\r\nbeen initiated into all liberal arts; he is acquainted with all\r\nphilosophers, historians, poets, cosmographers, and theologians; and\r\nis no stranger to civil and canon law, or even to medicine.” He was\r\nthe patron of scholars, and was equally devoted to ecclesiastical and\r\nprofane literature. Although he was the son of a physician, it is\r\nnot true that he was ever one himself, as has been stated.[811] It\r\nis pleasant, however, to reflect that this pope, whose name is most\r\nintimately associated with the revival of learning, probably imbibed\r\nmuch of the scientific lore of his time which his father’s profession\r\nwould encourage, and that taste for learning and that liberal spirit\r\nwhich has always been associated with the medical profession. The\r\nHumanists—as those who devoted themselves to the Humanities, such as\r\nphilology, rhetoric, poetry, and the study of the ancient classes, were\r\ncalled—found a friendly reception at the papal court.\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS OF CUSA was the reforming Cardinal Bishop of Brixen\r\n(1401-1464). Giordano Bruno called him “the divine Cusanus.” In\r\nphysical science he was greatly in advance of his age, and he united\r\nmoral worth with intellectual gifts of the highest order.\r\n\r\nPOPE PIUS II., better known in literature as Æneas Sylvius, pope from\r\n1458 to 1464, was also a great friend to the Humanists, a man of\r\ngreat intellectual power. He stands forth in history as “the figure\r\nin whom the mediæval and the modern spirit are most distinctly seen\r\nto meet and blend,” ere the age of science begins to strangle the age\r\nof superstition. Professor Creighton says that Pius II. is the first\r\nwriter “who consciously applied a scientific conception of history to\r\nthe explanation and arrangement of passing events.”[812]\r\n\r\nLEONARDO DA VINCI (1452-1519), “the Faust of the Renaissance,” excelled\r\nnot only as an artist, but in all kinds of experimental investigation.\r\nHe was an anatomist, botanist, physiologist, and chemist. Had he\r\napplied himself wholly to science, he would have been foremost in that\r\nbranch to which he devoted his wonderful energies. He was one of the\r\ngreatest and earliest of natural philosophers. He has been declared\r\nto have been “the founder of the study of the anatomy and structural\r\nclassification of plants, the founder, or at least the chief reviver,\r\nof the science of hydraulics—[the discoverer of] the molecular\r\ncomposition of water, the motion of waves, and even the undulatory\r\ntheory of light and heat. He discovered the construction of the eye\r\nand the optical laws of vision, and invented the camera obscura. He\r\ninvestigated the composition of explosives and the application of steam\r\npower.”[813]\r\n\r\nMATTHEW DE GRADIBUS, of Fiuli, near Milan, in 1480 composed treatises\r\non the anatomy of the human body. He first described the ovaries of the\r\nfemale correctly.\r\n\r\nGABRIEL DE ZERBIS (about 1495), of Verona, an eminent but verbose\r\nanatomist, dissected the human subject, and recognised the olfactory\r\nnerves. He mentioned the oblique and circular muscular fibres of the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER ACHILLINI (1463-1512), of Bologna, the pupil of Mondino, is\r\nknown in the history of anatomy as the first who described the two\r\nbones of the ear (tympanal bones), the malleus and incus. In 1503\r\nhe showed that the tarsus (or ankle and instep bones) were seven in\r\nnumber, so painfully and slowly was such a simple thing in human\r\nanatomy settled in those times. He was more accurately acquainted with\r\nthe intestines than any of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nCORNELIUS AGRIPPA (1486-1536) was born at Cologne, and was a profound\r\nstudent of what is known as “Occult Philosophy,” a strange jumble\r\nof astrology, alchemy, cabalism, theology, and the teaching of the\r\nso-called “Hermetic Books.” This sort of thing has of late years again\r\nbecome fashionable under the revived name of Theosophy.\r\n\r\nHe seems to have been sufficiently harmless; but as he knew much\r\nmore of physical science than was considered consistent with good\r\nchurchmanship in those times, he was persecuted by the monk Catilinet,\r\nand was forced to fly from place to place.\r\n\r\nJOHANN REUCHLIN (1455-1522) was the first great German humanist. His\r\nservices to learning were chiefly in connection with the restoration\r\nof Hebrew and Greek letters in Germany. He worshipped truth as his\r\ngod, was interested in philosophy, especially in that of the Cabala,\r\nin which he sought a theosophy which should reconcile science\r\nwith religion. His sentiments brought him into conflict with the\r\nInquisition, but by appeal to Rome, after a long and tedious process,\r\nthe trial was quashed; the consequence being that the lovers of\r\nlearning and progress banded themselves together against the opponents\r\nof learning, and assured the progress of the principles of the\r\nRenaissance in Germany. Reuchlin was the author of a celebrated work,\r\nentitled _De Verbo Mirifico_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWEATING SICKNESS.\r\n\r\nThe disease known as the sweating sickness first made its appearance\r\nin England in 1485, after the battle of Bosworth. It followed in\r\nthe rear of Henry’s victorious army, and spread in a few weeks from\r\nWales to the metropolis. It is described by Hecker[814] as being “a\r\nviolent inflammatory fever, which, after a short rigor, prostrated the\r\npowers as with a blow; and amidst painful oppression at the stomach,\r\nheadache, and lethargic stupor, suffused the whole body with a fetid\r\nperspiration.”\r\n\r\nHolinshed[815] describes it thus: “Suddenlie a deadlie burning sweat so\r\nassailed their bodies and distempered their blood with a most ardent\r\nheat, that _scarce one amongst an hundred_ that sickened did escape\r\nwith life; for all in maner as soone as the sweat took them, or within\r\na short time after, yeelded the ghost. Two lord mayors and six aldermen\r\ndied within one week. Many who went to bed at night perfectly well\r\nwere dead on the following morning; the victims, for the most part,\r\nwere the robust and vigorous. One attack gave no security against a\r\nsecond; many were seized even a third time.” The whole of England was\r\nvisited by this plague by the end of the year. When it reached Oxford,\r\nprofessors and students fled in all directions, and the University was\r\nentirely deserted for six weeks. Medicine afforded little or no relief.\r\nEven Thomas Linacre, the founder of the Royal College of Physicians in\r\n1518, does not in his writings say a word about the disease. As the\r\ndoctors failed to help the people, their common sense had to suffice\r\nthem in their need. They decided to take no violent medicine, but to\r\napply moderate heat; take little food and drink, and quietly wait for\r\ntwenty-four hours—the crisis of the disorder. “Those who were attacked\r\nduring the day, in order to avoid any chill, immediately went to bed in\r\ntheir clothes; and those who sickened by night did not rise from their\r\nbeds in the morning; while all carefully avoided exposing to the air\r\neven a hand or foot.”[816]\r\n\r\nThe five years preceding the outbreak of this epidemic had been\r\nunusually wet, and inundations had been frequent. It is probable that\r\nthis was one of the causes which contributed to the unhealthy condition\r\nof the atmosphere. The disease partook of the character of rheumatic\r\nfever, with great disorder of the nervous system.[817] In addition to\r\nthe profuse and injurious perspiration, oppressed respiration, extreme\r\nanxiety, nausea, and vomiting, indicating that the functions of the\r\neighth pair of nerves were disturbed, were the general symptoms of the\r\nmalady. A stupor and profound lethargy indicated cerebral disturbance,\r\npossibly from a morbid condition of the blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nTARANTISM.\r\n\r\nTarantism was a disease somewhat akin to the dancing mania. Nicholas\r\nPerotti (1430-1480) first described it. It was believed to originate\r\nfrom the bite of the Apulian spider, called the _tarantula_, as it was\r\nnamed by the Romans. Those who were bitten, or who believed themselves\r\nto have been bitten, became melancholic and stupefied, but greatly\r\nsensible to the influence of music. As soon as they heard their\r\nfavourite melodies, they sprang up and danced till they sank exhausted\r\nto the ground. Others became hysterical, and some even died in a\r\nparoxysm of tears or laughter. By the close of the fifteenth century\r\nTarantism had spread beyond the boundaries of Apulia in which it\r\noriginated, and many other cities and villages of Italy were afflicted\r\nwith the mania. Thus when the spider made his appearance the merry\r\nnotes of the Tarantella resounded as the only cure for its bite, or the\r\nmental poison received through the eye, and thus the _Tarantali_ cure\r\nbecame established as a popular festival.[818]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nQuarantine, according to William Brownrigg, who wrote in 1771 a book on\r\nthe plague, was first established by the Venetians in 1484. Dr. Mead\r\nwas probably the source of this information.[819]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTheories connected with the origin of the soul have continued to\r\noccupy the attention of theologians, philosophers, and physicians from\r\nthe time of Pythagoras to our own day. Up to the ninth century their\r\nspeculations were entirely idle, when Theophilus made his discovery\r\nof the capillary vessels of the male organs—a discovery which was\r\nfurther developed when in the fifteenth century Mattheus de Gradibus\r\nfirst enunciated the idea that these organs and the ovaria of birds are\r\nhomologous structures; and thus originated the knowledge of the germ\r\ncells known as the ova of De Graaf.[820]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fame of the University of Oxford was so high in the early part of\r\nthe fifteenth century (1420) that a MS. in the Bodleian, quoted by\r\nAnthony à Wood,[821] says that other universities were but little stars\r\nin comparison with this sun. “Other studies excel in some particular\r\nscience, as Parys, in divinity; Bologna, law; Salerno, physick; and\r\nToulouse, mathematics; but Oxford as a true well of wisdom doth goe\r\nbeyond them in all these. The bright beams of its wisdom spread over\r\nthe whole world.”\r\n\r\nThe practice of medicine became daily more honourable.\r\n\r\nHolinshed says,[822] in his description of the people in the\r\n_Commonwealth of England_, that “Who soeur studieth the lawes of the\r\nrealme, who so abideth in the vniuersitie giuing his mind to his booke,\r\nor professeth physicke and the liberall sciences—and can liue without\r\nmanuell labour, and thereto is able and will beare the port, charge and\r\ncountenance of a gentleman, he shall for monie haue a cote and armes\r\nbestowed vpon him by heralds—and reputed for a gentleman euer after.”\r\n\r\nMedicine was a flourishing study at Cambridge, especially at Merton\r\nCollege, in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries.[823]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe origin of syphilis in Europe has been the subject of much learned\r\ndiscussion. It appeared with such violence and frequency in the year\r\n1490 in France, Italy, and Spain, that the scourge was considered to\r\nhave only then been introduced into Europe from America.\r\n\r\n“Its enormous prevalence in modern times,” says Dr. Creighton,[824]\r\n“dates, without doubt, from the European libertinism of the latter\r\npart of the fifteenth century.” It is pretty certain that syphilis\r\nhad existed in Europe from ancient times. What appeared with so much\r\nvirulence and such wide distribution in 1490 was simply a redevelopment\r\nof the malady on a scale hitherto unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMEDICINE IN ANCIENT MEXICO AND PERU.\r\n\r\n Hospitals in Mexico.—Anatomy and Human Sacrifices.—Midwives as\r\n Spiritual Mothers.—Circumcision.—Peru.—Discovery of Cinchona Bark.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle or nothing is known of the ancient history of Mexico and Peru.\r\nMexico, anciently called Anahuac, was probably conquered by the Aztecs,\r\nwho founded the city of Mexico about 1325. It was discovered in 1517.\r\nPeru was long governed by the Incas, said to be descended from Manco\r\nCapac, who ruled in the eleventh century. It was explored and conquered\r\nby Pizarro, 1524-1533.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this work the history of these countries dates from\r\nthe time of their discovery, as the Spaniards in their blind fanaticism\r\ndestroyed most of their literature. Don Juan de Zumarraga was one of\r\nthe darkeners of human intelligence; he diligently collected all the\r\nMexican manuscripts, especially from Tezcuco, the literary capital\r\nof the Mexican empire, and burned them in one great bonfire in the\r\nmarket-place of Tlatelolco.[825]\r\n\r\nLas Casas says that there were public hospitals in the cities of\r\nMexico, Tlascala, and Cholula, expressly endowed for the relief of\r\nthe sick. As surgeons attended the Mexican armies, it is evident that\r\nthey had attained some skill in medicine and surgery. They used the\r\ntemazcalli, or vapour-bath, practised bleeding, and knew the medicinal\r\nproperties of many herbs. They professed to have learned this wisdom\r\nfrom their ancestors, the Tultecas, whose knowledge of chemistry they\r\nlikewise extolled. As human sacrifices were of daily occurrence in the\r\ncity of Mexico, they must have acquired some knowledge of anatomy,\r\nwhich would assist them in the practice of surgery.[826]\r\n\r\nMidwives were treated by the ancient Mexicans with great deference.\r\nThey were termed “spiritual mothers,” and were believed to be under\r\nthe immediate inspiration of the god Tezcatlipoca. Aglio says that\r\nthe treatment of lying-in women was very similar to that among the\r\nJews.[827]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Mexicans practised circumcision, and venerated the\r\nTequepatl, or flint knife, with which the rite was performed.[828]\r\n\r\nAmong the many vegetable products which America introduced to Europe\r\nwere maize, potatoes, chocolate, tobacco, ipecacuanha, and Peruvian\r\nbark, from which we obtain quinine. The discovery of this valuable\r\nmedicine was due to the Jesuit missionaries. The second wife of the\r\nviceroy, the Count of Chinchon, accompanied him to Peru. In 1628 she\r\nwas attacked by a tertian fever. Her physician was unable to cure\r\nher. At about the same time an Indian of Uritusinga, near Loxa, in\r\nthe government of Quito, had given some fever-curing bark to a Jesuit\r\nmissionary. He sent some of it to Torres Vasquez, who was rector of the\r\nJesuit College at Lima and confessor to the viceroy. Torres Vasquez\r\ncured the vice-queen by administering doses of the bark.... The remedy\r\nwas long known as Countess’s Bark and Jesuit’s Bark, and Linnæus gave\r\nthe name _Chinchona_ [after the viceroy Chinchon] to the genus of\r\nplants which produces it.... Various species of this precious tree are\r\nfound throughout the eastern cordillera of the Andes for a distance of\r\n2,000 miles. We owe guaiacum, sarsaparilla, sassafras, logwood, jalap,\r\nseneka, serpentaria, and many other valuable drugs to the same part of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nFrezier, in his voyage to the South Sea and along the coasts of Chili\r\nand Peru in the years 1712, 1713, and 1714, says concerning Lima:\r\n“There is an herb called _Carapullo_, which grows like a tuft of\r\ngrass, and yields an ear, the decoction of which makes such as drink\r\nit delirious for some days. The Indians make use of it to discover the\r\nnatural disposition of their children. All the time when it has its\r\noperation, they place by them the tools of all such trades as they\r\nmay follow—as by a maiden, a spindle, wool, scissors, cloth, kitchen\r\nfurniture, etc.; and by a youth, accoutrements for a horse, awls,\r\nhammers, etc.; and that tool they take most fancy to in their delirium,\r\nis a certain indication of the trade they are fittest for, as I was\r\nassured by a French surgeon, who was an eye-witness to this verity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK V.\r\n\r\n               _THE DAWN OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC MEDICINE._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n The Dawn of Modern Science.—The Reformation of\r\n Medicine.—Paracelsus—The Sceptics.—The Protestantism of\r\n Science.—Influenza.—Legal Recognition of Medicine in England.—The\r\n Barber-Surgeons.—The Sweating Sickness.—Origin of the Royal\r\n College of Physicians of London.—“Merry Andrew.”—Origin of St.\r\n Bartholomew’s Hospital.—Caius.—Low State of Midwifery.—The Great\r\n Continental Anatomists.—Vesalius.—Servetus.—Paré.—Influence of the\r\n Reformation.—The Rosicrucians.—Touching for the Evil.—Vivisection of\r\n Human Beings.—Origin of Legal Medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America in 1492 fitly typifies the still grander\r\nmental world about to disclose its wonders to the newly liberated\r\nminds of scientific investigators. The revolt against authority in\r\nreligion was paralleled by a scientific Protestantism; the mind of\r\nman, long held in bondage to absurd and groundless fancies, struggled\r\nto set itself free, to investigate, to test and explore on its\r\naccount, instead of accepting for granted doctrines elaborated in the\r\nphilosopher’s brains.\r\n\r\nThe revolt of medicine against the authority of Galen may be compared\r\nto the revolt against Aristotle in philosophy. The authority of the\r\nArabian schools was overthrown, the principles of Hippocrates were\r\nin the ascendant. The era of the Renaissance was not more an era of\r\nProtestantism than an age of Scepticism. Faith had become credulity,\r\nand credulity had sunk into imbecility. The power of the printing\r\npress, the spread of humanism, the beginning of scientific inquiry,\r\nthe discovery of the splendid treasure of classic literature, long\r\nburied beneath the dust of dark and barbarous ages, the widening of\r\nthe mental horizon as the world doubled itself before the prows of\r\nthe discoverers’ vessels—all these factors brought about the new\r\nbirth of Science. It was the golden age of the medical sciences.\r\nAnatomy and surgery awoke, from their long slumber, and Europe\r\nentered upon a period of scientific investigation such as the world\r\nhad never known before. Medicine formed an alliance with what are\r\ncalled its accessory sciences; chemistry liberated from slavery to\r\nthe alchemist, botany set free from the delusions of the doctrine\r\nof “signatures,” pharmacy elevated into a branch of medical science\r\nfrom the kitchen and the confectioner’s store-room, lent their aid,\r\nin conjunction with the hydraulics and pneumatics of the natural\r\nphilosopher, to advance it. All these things meant revolt against\r\nthe old order, Protestantism against the outworn creeds of Greek and\r\nArabian dogmatists. They meant more than this. Ere the ground could\r\nbe cleared for the new palace of physical science which the glorious\r\nsixteenth century was to rear, scepticism must lend its withering\r\nand desolating aid; foul undergrowths must be destroyed; evil germs,\r\nbred of the stagnant marshes of the dark ages, must perish under the\r\nwholesome, if ruthless, disinfectants of reason and unbelief. There\r\nwas a stern need of this. The demon theory of disease had lasted from\r\nprimeval ages up to this dawn of the sixteenth century. From glacial\r\ntimes, through savage ages and religions, and often in beautifully\r\npoetic faiths, the disease-demon held its own. Even in the hallowed and\r\nrenovating pages of the gospels the disease-demon stalks unchallenged\r\nsave by the thaumaturgist. Now he is to be banished from the mind of\r\ncivilized man for ever; and to reach this goal atheism was needed.\r\nThe sixteenth century, so far as medicine and physical science are\r\nconcerned, opens with the Cabalist Theosophists, Trithemius, Cornelius\r\nAgrippa, Cardan, and their followers. Giordano Bruno, the aggressive\r\natheist and martyr of science, Montaigne, the philosophic sceptic,\r\nCharron, the opponent of all religion, and Rabelais, the witty scoffer\r\nat the gross corruptions of orthodoxy, helped to clear the ground for\r\nthe work of the scientists. Meanwhile Paracelsus, from his chair at\r\nBasel University, having made an _auto-da-fe_ of ancient and dogmatic\r\nmedicine, lays the foundation-stone of the medicine of the modern era.\r\n\r\nAn army of savants begins to work for science as well as literature.\r\nLinacre has introduced Italian Humanism to the doctors of England;\r\nCaius busies himself with the Greek and Latin texts of the great\r\nwriters on medicine; Gesner, the German Pliny, and Aldrovandi promote\r\nthe study of natural history. Everywhere men are busy with the\r\nbeginnings of electricity, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, and the\r\nother sciences which are to be the handmaidens of medicine. One clear\r\nvoice is heard from Basel. It is that of Paracelsus, exhuming physical\r\nscience: “You Italy, you Dalmatia, you Sarmatia, Athens, Greece,\r\nArabia, and Israel, follow me. Come out of the night of the mind!”\r\n\r\nThe teacher of Paracelsus, who exercised the greatest influence upon\r\nhis mental development, was the celebrated TRITHEMIUS, the abbot of\r\nthe Spanheim Benedictines (about 1500), who was so famous a student of\r\nchemistry and the occult philosophy that scholars and mighty nobles\r\nwent on pilgrimages and princes sent ambassadors, to his monastery to\r\ngather some fragments of his vast learning. Amongst many works, he\r\npublished several on magical subjects, and was the first who told the\r\nwondrous story of Dr. Faustus, in whose magical doings he was a devout\r\nbeliever.[829] His famous library consisted of the rare possession of\r\ntwo thousand volumes. Cornelius Agrippa was his pupil, and in a letter\r\nwhich he sent to his old master, with the manuscript of his _Occult\r\nPhilosophy_, we find a passage which throws a light on the studies of\r\nthe worthy abbot: “We conferred much about chemical matters, magic,\r\ncabalism, and other things which at the present time lie hidden as\r\nsecret sciences and arts.”[830]\r\n\r\nTHEOPHRASTUS BOMBASTUS PARACELSUS OF HOHENHEIM (1493-1541), “The\r\nReformer of Medicine,” “Luther Alter,” effected a revolution in\r\nmedicine, and is one of the most remarkable characters, not only in\r\nthe history of the medical profession, but in that of civilization.\r\nThere was so much in this great man’s conduct to admire, and so much\r\nof which to disapprove, that it is not surprising that he has been\r\neither wholly praised or entirely condemned, and by very few considered\r\ndispassionately. Perhaps Mr. Browning, in his noble poem _Paracelsus_,\r\nhas given the world the truest conception of a man who did for his\r\nprofession and for humanity the enormous service of liberating medicine\r\nfrom a slavish adhesion to authority, though it must be admitted that\r\nhe was guilty of extravagances and excesses we may find it difficult to\r\nexcuse, even though for the most part they were faults common to his\r\ncountry and his age. Paracelsus was born ten years later than Luther,\r\nat Einsiedeln, near Zurich. He studied under the abbot Trithemius of\r\nSpanheim, who was a great adept in magic, alchemy, and astrology.\r\nUnder this teacher he acquired a taste for occult studies, and formed\r\na determination to use them for the welfare of mankind. Trithemius\r\nwas a theosophist. As was the custom of the times, Paracelsus became\r\nan itinerant student after his course at the University of Basel. He\r\nstudied chemistry in the laboratory of the Fuggers at Schwatz, in the\r\nTyrol.\r\n\r\nAttached to the armies, he travelled widely as a military surgeon in\r\nthe Netherlands, the Romagna, Naples, Venice, Denmark. He worked in the\r\nmines, that he might acquire a knowledge of metals, working as a common\r\nlabourer for his bread. In Bohemian fashion he wandered over the world,\r\nvisiting Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Tartary, and the East. He picked up\r\nhis scientific knowledge by any means rather than from books. He said,\r\n“Reading never made a doctor, but practice is what forms a physician.\r\nFor all reading is a footstool to practice, and a mere feather broom.\r\nHe who meditates discovers something.” And so he held converse with\r\nthe common folk, and talked and drank with boors, shepherds, Jews,\r\ngypsies, and tramps, gaining odd scraps of knowledge wherever he could.\r\nHe had no books. His only volume was Nature, whom he interrogated at\r\nfirst-hand. He would rather learn medicine and surgery from an old\r\ncountry nurse than from an university lecturer. If there was one thing\r\nwhich he detested more than another, it was the principle of authority.\r\nHe bent his head to no man.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1525 Paracelsus went to Basel, where he was fortunate\r\nin curing Froben, the great printer, by his laudanum, when he had\r\nthe gout. Froben was the friend of Erasmus, who was associated with\r\nŒcolampadius, and soon after, upon the recommendation of Œcolampadius,\r\nhe was appointed by the city magnates a professor of physics, medicine,\r\nand surgery, with a considerable salary; at the same time they made\r\nhim city physician, to the duties of which office he requested might\r\nbe added inspector of drug shops. This examination made the druggists\r\nhis bitterest enemies, as he detected their fraudulent practices; they\r\ncombined to set the other doctors of the city against him, and as these\r\nwere exceedingly jealous of his skill and success, poor Paracelsus\r\nfound himself in a hornet’s nest. We find him a professor at Basel\r\nUniversity in 1526. He has become famous as a physician, the medicines\r\nwhich he has discovered he has successfully used in his practice; he\r\nwas now in the eyes of his patients at least,\r\n\r\n    “The wondrous Paracelsus, life’s dispenser,\r\n    Fate’s commissary, idol of the schools and courts.”\r\n\r\nHe began his lectures at Basel by lighting some sulphur in a chafing\r\ndish, and burning the books of his great predecessors in the medical\r\nart, Avicenna, Galen, and others, saying: “Sic vos ardebitis in\r\ngehennâ.” He boasted that he had read no books for ten years, though\r\nhe protested that his shoe-buckles were more learned than the authors\r\nwhose works he had burned.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a wonderful spectacle when this new teacher took\r\nhis place before his pupils. The benches occupied hitherto by a dozen\r\nor two of students were crowded with an eager audience anxious for\r\nthe new learning. Literature had been exhumed many years before, and\r\nnow it was the turn of Science! Leaving the morbid seclusion of the\r\ncloisters, men had given up dreaming for inquiry, and baseless visions\r\nfor the acquisition of facts. This was the childhood of our science,\r\nand its days were bright with the poetry of youth. It is a sight to\r\narouse our enthusiasm to see in the early dawn of our modern science\r\nthis man standing up alone to pit himself against the whole scientific\r\nauthority of his day. He rises from the crucibles and fires where his\r\npredecessors had been vainly seeking for gold and silver, ever and\r\nagain pretending to have found them, and always going empty-handed to\r\na deluded world. Henceforth, he says, his alchemy shall serve a nobler\r\npurpose than gold seeking; it shall aid in the healing of disease.\r\nHe casts aside the sacred books of medicine which have been handed\r\ndown the ages by his predecessors; destroying them, he declares, with\r\nan earnestness which is less tinged by arrogance than by conviction,\r\nthat these men had been blind guides, that he alone has the clue of\r\nthe maze, and he forsakes all to follow Truth, though she lead him to\r\ndeath. In his generous impulse to serve mankind he has spoken harshly\r\nof his opponents. They would not have helped him, any way. He was above\r\nthem; they could not understand him, so they hated him, and he scorned\r\nthem. As too often happens to such heroes, he forgot the love of his\r\nneighbour in his love for mankind.\r\n\r\nParacelsus found his pupils holding fast by the teachings of the school\r\nof Salerno, and there seems no ground for supposing that the healing\r\nart had made the slightest progress in Europe from the foundation\r\nof that school in 1150, except perhaps in pharmacy. On the day that\r\nParacelsus stood up before his audience at Basel University, he cried,\r\n“Away with Ætius, Oribasius, Galen, Rhasis, Serapion, Avicenna,\r\nAverroes, and the other blocks!” He had diplomas sent him from Germany,\r\nFrance, and Italy, and a letter from Erasmus.\r\n\r\nIn 1528 we find him at Colmar, in Alsatia. He has been driven by\r\npriests and doctors from Basel.\r\n\r\nHe had been called to the bedside of some rich cleric who was ill.\r\nHe cured him, but so speedily that his fee was refused. Though not\r\nat all a mercenary man (for he always gave the poor his services\r\ngratuitously), he sued the priest; but the judge refused to interfere,\r\nand Paracelsus used strong language to him, and had to fly to escape\r\npunishment. We must not be too hard upon the canon. Disease was treated\r\nwith profound respect in those days, and great patients liked to be\r\ncured with deliberation and some ceremonial.\r\n\r\nThe closing scenes of the life of Paracelsus were passed in a cell\r\nin the hospital of Salzburg, in the year 1541, when he died at the\r\nage of forty-eight, a martyr of science. Recent investigations in\r\ncontemporary records have proved that he had been attacked by the\r\nservants of certain physicians who were his jealous enemies, and that\r\nin consequence of a fall he sustained a fracture of the skull, which\r\nproved fatal in a few days.\r\n\r\nWithin a period of time covering fifteen years he had written some 106\r\ntreatises on medicine, alchemy, natural history and philosophy, magic,\r\nand other subjects. He despised University learning. “The book of\r\nNature,” he declared, “was that which the physician should read, and to\r\ndo so he must walk over its leaves.” His library consisted of a Bible,\r\nSt. Jerome on the Gospels, a volume on medicine, and seven manuscripts.\r\nHis epitaph tells but a part of his honours. “Here lies Philippus\r\nParacelsus, the famous doctor of medicine, who, by his wonderful art,\r\ncured bad wounds, lepra, gout, dropsy, and other incurable diseases,\r\nand to his own honour divided his possessions among the poor.”\r\n\r\nThis but feebly expresses what medicine owes to him. He discovered the\r\nmetal zinc, and hydrogen gas. In place of the elaborate concoctions\r\nand filthy messes which were given as medicines in his time, he taught\r\ndoctors to give tinctures and quintessences of drugs. He invented\r\nlaudanum, and anticipated our discovery of transfusion of blood. He\r\nopposed the barbarous method of reducing dislocations and dealing with\r\nfractures, introduced the use of mercury in the treatment of syphilis,\r\nand came very near to the discoveries which go under the name of\r\nDarwinism. He taught that chemistry was to be employed, not in making\r\ngold, but for the preparation of medicines; and he introduced into\r\npractice mineral remedies, including mineral baths, iron, sulphur,\r\nantimony, arsenic, gold, tin, lead, etc. Amongst the vegetable remedies\r\nemployed by him was arnica.\r\n\r\nParacelsus used chemical principles, says Sprengel, for the explanation\r\nof particular diseases. “Most or all diseases, according to him, arise\r\nfrom the effervescence of salts, from the combustion of sulphur, or\r\nfrom the coagulation of mercury.”[831]\r\n\r\nHis ætiology attributed diseases to five causes:—1. The Ens astrale\r\n(a certain power of the stars); this means no more than foul air. 2.\r\nThe Ens veneni (power of poison), arising from errors of assimilation\r\nand digestion. 3. The Ens naturale (power of nature or of the body);\r\ndiatheses. 4. Ens spirituale (power of the spirit); the disorders which\r\narise from perverted ideas. 5. Ens Dei (power of God); the injuries or\r\ncauses of disease predetermined by God.[832]\r\n\r\nWhen Paracelsus came upon the scene of medical history, alchemy had\r\njust begun to lose its credit. The true students of science had\r\ndiscovered its deceptions and had abandoned it to the quacks. It has\r\noften happened, and happens still, that certain pretended sciences,\r\nwhen cast aside as worthless, are taken from their hiding-places and\r\nmade to do duty in another and perhaps nobler form. Paracelsus set\r\nhimself the task of rehabilitating alchemy. The deeper thinkers,\r\nthe more ardent truth-seekers in religion and science, imbued with\r\nphilosophy and penetrated by the scholasticism of the age, were quite\r\nready for a new reign of theosophical medicine to take the place of the\r\nArabian polypharmacy.\r\n\r\nGEORGE AGRICOLA (1494-1555) was a physician who practised in Bohemia,\r\nand was the first to raise mineralogy to the dignity of a science. He\r\ndid so much for it, in fact, that no great advance was made in it from\r\nthe point at which he left it, till the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nCONRAD GESNER (1516-1565), surnamed the German Pliny, was a famous\r\nnaturalist of vast erudition, and imbued with an enthusiastic love\r\nof science. In 1541 he was professor of physics and natural history\r\nat Zurich. He wrote several books on ancient medicine and botany. To\r\nprepare himself to write his _History of Animals_, he read 250 authors,\r\ntravelled nearly all over Europe, and gathered information from every\r\nsource, even from hunters and shepherds. His medical works show that he\r\nwas far above the absurd fancies and prejudices of his time.\r\n\r\nANDREAS CÆSALPINUS (1519-1603), the first systematical botanist, and\r\nthe founder of the work which Linnæus developed, studied, if he did\r\nnot also teach, anatomy and medicine at Pisa. He had a clear idea of\r\nthe circulation of the blood, at least through the lungs, and he was\r\nthe first to use the term “circulation.” Claims have been made on\r\nhis behalf as the discoverer of the circulation; but they cannot be\r\nsubstantiated, as he did not know of the _direct_ flow of the blood\r\nfrom the arteries to the veins.\r\n\r\nCARDAN (1501-1576), a physician and astrologer, was also a half-crazy\r\nmagician. He was a skilful physician, and visited King Edward VI. to\r\ncalculate his nativity, and Cardinal Beaton to cure him in his sickness.\r\n\r\nGIORDANO BRUNO (1548-1600) was an Italian philosopher of the\r\nRenaissance, who, from a determination to study the universe for\r\nhimself, threw off the restraints of the Christian religion and\r\nrevolted against the authority of Aristotle and tradition. His most\r\npopular and characteristic work is the _Spaccio_. He was not an\r\natheist, as has been asserted, but a pantheist. He considered the soul\r\nof man as a thinking monad, and as immortal. He was burnt at the stake\r\nfor his opinions, which, it must be admitted, were in some respects\r\ndetrimental to morality as well as to faith.\r\n\r\nMICHEL DE MONTAIGNE (1533-1592), the sceptical founder of a new\r\nphilosophy, and one of the most delightful of essayists, anticipated\r\nthe scientific spirit by his minute and critical observation upon the\r\ncurious facts connected with human nature.\r\n\r\nFRANÇOIS RABELAIS (_c._ 1490-1553) entered the faculty of medicine at\r\nMontpellier.\r\n\r\nEURICUS CORDUS (1486-1535), who studied medicine at Erfurt, is famous\r\nfor the following admirable epigram:—\r\n\r\n    “Three faces wears the doctor: when first sought,\r\n    An angel’s—and a God’s, the cure half wrought;\r\n    But, when that cure complete, he seeks his fee,\r\n    The Devil looks then less terrible than he.”\r\n\r\nHis son, VALERIUS CORDUS (1515-1544), was the discoverer of sulphuric\r\nether.\r\n\r\nANTONIO BENIVIENI (_c._ 1500), a physician of Florence, was the morning\r\nstar of a new era for surgery, when he insisted that the compilations\r\nof the ancients and Arabians ought to be given up for the observation\r\nof nature.[833] Thus, before the time of Ambroise Paré (1509-1590), the\r\nway for the reception of the true modern surgery was prepared in Italy\r\nby the efforts of those who strove to induce educated and talented men\r\nto devote their attention to this branch of the healing art.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENZA.\r\n\r\nA violent and extensive catarrhal fever prevailed in France and Europe\r\ngenerally in 1510. Hecker considers there is evidence that it had its\r\norigin in the remotest parts of the East.[834] His description of\r\nthis influenza is as follows: “The catarrhal symptoms, which, on the\r\nappearance of disorders of this kind, usually form their commencement,\r\nseem to have been quite thrown into the background by those of violent\r\nrheumatism and inflammation. The patient was first seized with\r\ngiddiness and severe headache; then came on a shooting pain through the\r\nshoulders and extending to the thighs. The loins, too, were affected\r\nwith intolerably painful dartings, during which an inflammatory fever\r\nset in with delirium and violent excitement. In some the parotid glands\r\nbecame inflamed, and even the digestive organs participated in the\r\ndeep-rooted malady; for those affected had, together with constant\r\noppression at the stomach, a great loathing for all animal food, and a\r\ndislike even of wine. Among the poor as well as the rich many died, and\r\nsome quite suddenly, of this strange disease, in the treatment of which\r\nthe physicians shortened life not a little by their purgative treatment\r\nand phlebotomy, seeking an excuse for their ignorance in the influence\r\nof the constellations, and alleging that astral diseases were beyond\r\nthe reach of human art.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGAL RECOGNITION OF MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS.\r\n\r\nThe first Act of Parliament dealing with the medical profession in\r\nEngland was passed in the year 1511, and is entitled “AN ACT FOR THE\r\nAPPOINTING OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS,” the preamble of which runs as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n“Forasmuch as the science and cunning of Physick and Surgery (to the\r\nperfect knowledge of which be requisite both great learning and ripe\r\nexperience) is daily within this realm exercised by a great multitude\r\nof ignorant persons, of whom the greater part have no manner of insight\r\nin the same, nor in any other kind of learning; some also can read no\r\nletters on the book, so far forth that common artificers, as smiths,\r\nweavers, and women, boldly and accustomably take upon them great cures,\r\nand things of great difficulty, in the which they partly use sorcery\r\nand witchcraft, partly apply such medicines unto the disease as be\r\nvery noxious, and nothing meet therefore, to the high displeasure of\r\nGod, great infamy to the faculty, and the grievous hurt, damage, and\r\ndestruction of many of the king’s liege people; most especially of them\r\nthat cannot discern the uncunning from the cunning. Be it therefore\r\n(to the surety and comfort of all manner of people) by the authority\r\nof this present Parliament enacted:—That no person within the city of\r\nLondon, nor within seven miles of the same, take upon him to exercise\r\nand occupy as a Physician or Surgeon except he be first examined,\r\napproved, and admitted by the Bishop of London, or by the Dean of St.\r\nPaul’s, for the time being, calling to him or them four Doctors of\r\nPhysic, and for Surgeons, other expert persons in that faculty; and\r\nfor the first examination such as they shall think convenient, and\r\nafterwards alway four of them that have been so approved.[835] ...\r\n\r\n“That no person out of the said city and precinct of seven miles\r\nof the same, except he have been (as is aforesaid) approved in the\r\nsame, take upon him to exercise and occupy as a Physician or Surgeon,\r\nin any diocese within this realm; but if he be first examined and\r\napproved by the Bishop of the same diocese, or, he being out of the\r\ndiocese, by his vicar-general; either of them calling to them such\r\nexpert persons in the said faculties, as their discretion shall think\r\nconvenient....”[836]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARBER-SURGEONS.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of shaving and trimming beards was anciently considered\r\na profession, and was united to that of surgery. In the reign of Louis\r\nXIV. of France the hairdressers were formally separated from the\r\nBarber-Surgeons, who were incorporated as a distinct medical body.\r\n\r\nA London Company of Barbers was formed in 1308, and the first year\r\nof the reign of Edward IV. (1462) the barbers were incorporated by a\r\ncharter which was confirmed by many succeeding monarchs. In 1540 the\r\nCompany of Barbers, and those who practised purely as Surgeons, were\r\nunited as “the commonalty of Barbers and Surgeons of London.” It was\r\nenacted (32 Hen. VIII.) that “No person using any shaving or barbery\r\nin London shall occupy any surgery, letting of blood, or other matter,\r\nexcept only drawing of teeth.” The Surgeons’ corporation in London two\r\nyears later petitioned Parliament to be exempted from bearing arms\r\nand serving on juries, so that they might be free to attend to their\r\npractice.[837] Their petition was granted, and all medical men are in\r\nthe enjoyment of these privileges at the present time.\r\n\r\nAn Act of Parliament was passed in 1540 allowing the United Companies\r\nof Barbers and Surgeons to have yearly four bodies of criminals for\r\npurposes of dissection. This is supposed to have been the first\r\nlegislative enactment passed in any country for promoting the study of\r\nanatomy.[838]\r\n\r\nSurgery in England in the reign of Henry VIII. was in a deplorable\r\ncondition. Thomas Gale thus describes the surgeons of the time:—\r\n\r\n“I remember when I was in the wars at Montreuil, in the time of\r\nthat most famous prince, Henry VIII., there was a great rabblement\r\nthere that took upon them to be surgeons. Some were sow-gelders,\r\nand some horse-gelders, with tinkers and cobblers. This noble sect\r\ndid such great cures that they got themselves a perpetual name; for\r\nlike as Thessalus’ sect were called Thessalonians, so was this noble\r\nrabblement, for their notorious cures, called dog-leeches; for in two\r\ndressings they did commonly make their cures whole and sound for ever,\r\nso that they felt neither heat nor cold, nor no manner of pain after.\r\nBut when the Duke of Norfolk, who was then general, understood how the\r\npeople did die, and that of small wounds, he sent for me and certain\r\nother surgeons, commanding us to make search how these men came to\r\ntheir death, whether it were by the grievousness of their wounds or\r\nby the lack of knowledge of the surgeons; and we, according to our\r\ncommandment, made search through all the camp, and found many of the\r\nsame good fellows which took upon them the names of surgeons; not only\r\nthe names but the wages also. We asking of them whether they were\r\nsurgeons or no, they said they were; we demanded with whom they were\r\nbrought up, and they, with shameless faces, would answer, either with\r\none cunning man, or another, which was dead. Then we demanded of them\r\nwhat chirurgery stuff they had to cure men withal; and they would show\r\nus a pot or a box which they had in a budget, wherein was such trumpery\r\nas they did use to grease horses’ heels withal, and laid upon scabbed\r\nhorses’ backs, with verval and such like. And others that were cobblers\r\nand tinkers used shoemaker’s wax, with the rust of old pans, and made\r\ntherewith ‘a noble salve,’ as they did term it. But in the end this\r\nworthy rabblement was committed to the Marshalsea, and threatened to be\r\nhanged for their worthy deeds, except they would declare the truth—what\r\nthey were and of what occupations; and in the end they did confess, as\r\nI have declared to you before.”\r\n\r\nGale says in another place: “I have, myself, in the time of King Henry\r\nVIII., helped to furnish out of London, in one year, which served by\r\nsea and land, three score and twelve surgeons, which were good workmen,\r\nand well able to serve, and all Englishmen. At this present day there\r\nare not thirty-four of all the whole company of Englishmen, and yet the\r\nmost part of them be in noblemen’s service, so that if we should have\r\nneed, I do not know where to find twelve sufficient men. What do I say?\r\nsufficient men? Nay; I would there were ten amongst all the company\r\nworthy to be called surgeons.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1518 the Barbers and Surgeons were united in one company.\r\nThe Barbers were restricted from performing any surgical operations,\r\nexcept drawing teeth, and the Surgeons, on their part, had to abandon\r\nshaving and trimming beards. Physicians were permitted to practise\r\nsurgery.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1542 it became necessary to pass an Act to further\r\nregulate the practice of Surgery, the chief points of which are the\r\nfollowing: “Whereas in the Parliament holden at Westminster, in the\r\nthird year of the King’s Most Gracious Reign, amongst other things,\r\nfor the avoiding of sorceries, witchcrafts, and other inconveniences,\r\nit was enacted, That no person within the City of London, nor within\r\nseven miles of the same, should take upon him to exercise and occupy\r\nas Physician and Surgeon, except he be first examined, admitted, and\r\napproved by the Bishop of London, etc.... Sithence the making of which\r\nsaid Act, the Company and Fellowship of Surgeons of London, minding\r\nonely their owne lucres, and nothing the profit or ease of the diseased\r\nor patient, have sued, troubled, and vexed divers honest persons,\r\nas well men as women, whom God hath endueed with the knowledge of\r\nthe nature, kind and operation of certain herbs, roots and waters,\r\nand the using and ministering of them, to such as have been pained\r\nwith custumable diseases, as women’s breasts being sore, a pin and\r\nthe web in the eye, uncomes of the hands, scaldings, burnings, sore\r\nmouths, the stone, stranguary, saucelin, and morphew, and such other\r\nlike diseases.... And yet the said persons have not taken anything\r\nfor their pains or cunning.... In consideration whereof, and for the\r\nease, comfort, succour, help, relief, and health of the King’s poor\r\nsubjects, inhabitants of this his realm, now pained or diseased, or\r\nthat hereafter shall be pained or diseased, Be it ordained, etc., that\r\nat all time from henceforth it shall be lawful to every person being\r\nthe King’s subject, having knowledge and experience of the nature of\r\nherbs, roots and waters, etc., to use and minister according to their\r\ncunning, experience, and knowledge ... the aforesaid statute ... or any\r\nother Act notwithstanding.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWEATING SICKNESS.\r\n\r\nIn 1517 England was visited by a third attack of the Sweating Sickness.\r\nPublic business was suspended, the King moved his court from place to\r\nplace, and a panic seized the people. Erasmus, writing to Wolsey’s\r\nphysician, says: “I am frequently astonished and grieved to think\r\nhow it is that England has been now for so many years troubled by a\r\ncontinual pestilence, especially by a deadly sweat, which appears in a\r\ngreat measure to be peculiar to your country. I have read how a city\r\nwas once delivered from a plague by a change in the houses, made at the\r\nsuggestion of a philosopher. I am inclined to think that this also must\r\nbe the deliverance for England.” He proceeds to suggest that better\r\nventilation is necessary for dwellings; he remarks that the glass\r\nwindows admit light, but not air; that such air as does enter comes in\r\nas draughts, through holes and corners full of pestilential emanations.\r\nThe floors laid with clay and covered with rushes, the bottom\r\nlayer of which was unchanged sometimes for twenty years, harboured\r\nexpectorations, vomitings, filth, and all sorts of abominations.\r\n\r\nHe advises that the use of rushes should be given up, that the rooms\r\nshould be so built as to be exposed to the light and fresh air on two\r\nor three sides, and that the windows be so constructed as to be easily\r\nopened or closed. He declares that at one time, if he ever entered a\r\nroom which had not been occupied for some months, he was sure to take\r\na fever. He suggests that the people should eat less, especially of\r\nsalt meats, and that proper officers be appointed to keep the streets\r\nand suburbs in better order. Erasmus was thus our first sanitary\r\nreformer.\r\n\r\nAubrey gives[839] a selection of the favourite prescriptions in use at\r\nthis period against the Sweating Sickness:—\r\n\r\n“Take endive, sowthistle, marygold, m’oney and nightshade, three\r\nhandfuls of all, and seethe them in conduit water, from a quart to a\r\npint, then strain it into a fair vessel, then delay it with a little\r\nsugar to put away the tartness, and then drink it when the sweat taketh\r\nyou, and keep you warm; and by the grace of God ye shall be whole.”\r\n\r\n“Take half an handful of rew, called herbe grace, an handful marygold,\r\nhalf an handful featherfew, a handful sorrel, a handful burnet, and\r\nhalf a handful dragons, the top in summer, the root in winter; wash\r\nthem in running water, and put them in an earthen pot with a pottle\r\nof running water, and let them seethe soberly to nigh the half be\r\nconsumed, and then draw aback the pot to it be almost cold, and then\r\nstrain it into a fair glass and keep it close, and use thereof morn\r\nand even, and when need is oftener; and if it be bitter, delay it with\r\nsugar candy; and if it be taken afore the pimples break forth, there is\r\nno doubt but with the grace of Jesu it shall amend any man, woman or\r\nchild.”\r\n\r\n“Another very true medicine.—For to say every day at seven parts of\r\nyour body, seven paternosters, and seven Ave Marias, with one Credo at\r\nthe last. Ye shal begyn at the ryght syde, under the ryght ere, saying\r\nthe ‘_paternoster qui es in cœlis, sanctificetur nomen tuum_,’ with\r\na cross made there with your thumb, and so say the paternoster full\r\ncomplete, and one Ave Maria, and then under the left ere, and then\r\nunder the left armhole, and then under the left the [thigh?] hole, and\r\nthen the last at the heart, with one paternoster, Ave Maria, with one\r\nCredo; and these thus said daily, with the grace of God is there no\r\nmanner drede hym.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS OF LONDON ESTABLISHED.\r\n\r\nThe Royal College of Physicians of London was founded by Henry VIII.\r\nfor the repression of irregular and unlearned medical practice. The\r\nLetters Patent constituting the College were dated 23rd September,\r\n1518. The king was moved to this by the example of similar institutions\r\nin Italy and elsewhere, by the solicitations of Thomas Linacre, one of\r\nhis own physicians, and by the advice and recommendation of Cardinal\r\nWolsey. Six physicians are named in the Letters Patent as constituting\r\nthe College, viz., John Chambre, Thomas Linacre, and Ferdinand de\r\nVictoria, the king’s physicians; and Nicholas Halsewell, John Francis,\r\nand Robert Yaxlery, physicians, “and all men of the same faculty, of\r\nand in London, and within seven miles thereof, are incorporated as one\r\nbody and perpetual community or college.”[840]\r\n\r\nDR. CHAMBRE was a priest before he became a physician. He was educated\r\nat Oxford, studied at Padua, where he graduated in physic.\r\n\r\nDR. THOMAS LINACRE was a distinguished scholar and physician, who was\r\nborn A.D. 1460. In 1484 he was elected a fellow of All Souls’, Oxford;\r\nthe next year he went to Bologna, where he studied under Pulitian;\r\nhe then went to Florence, where he became acquainted with Lorenzo\r\nthe Great; from Florence, he went to Rome, and thence to Venice and\r\nPadua, which at that time was the most celebrated school of physic in\r\nthe world, and took the degree of Doctor of Medicine with the highest\r\napplause. Linacre founded (1524) two Physic Lectures at Oxford and one\r\nat Cambridge, but “they were not performed till divers years after\r\nLinacre’s death, on account of the troubles concerning religion.”[841]\r\n\r\nDR. ANDREW BORDE, Carthusian monk, physician, wit and buffoon, lived in\r\nthe reign of Henry VIII. He took his physician’s degree at Montpellier\r\nin 1532, and afterwards became one of the court physicians on his\r\nreturn to England. He was a learned, genial, and sensible doctor,\r\nbut possessed “a rambling head and an inconstant mind,” as Anthony à\r\nWood says. He wrote voluminously. His chief works, the _Breviary of\r\nHealth_, _The Dietary of Health_, and _The Book of the Introduction to\r\nKnowledge_, have been edited by Dr. F. J. Furnivall, and published for\r\nthe Early English Text Society in a volume which is one of the most\r\nentertaining works on medicine ever written. Borde earned his title\r\nof “Merry Andrew” (a name which has become a household word) from\r\nattending fairs and revels, and conducting himself with the buffoonery\r\nwhich ill became so learned a man. Doubtless, however, it endeared\r\nhim to his countrymen of the period. His medical works are full of\r\nprescriptions for various complaints, and many of them are exceedingly\r\nvaluable and fully equal to the best treatment followed now.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS VICARY was probably born between 1490 and 1500, was not a\r\ntrained surgeon, but “a meane practiser” at Maidstone. In 1525 he was\r\njunior of the three Wardens of the Barbers’ or Barber-Surgeons’ Company\r\nin London. In 1528 he was Upper or First Warden of the Company,\r\nand one of the surgeons to Henry VIII., at £20 a year. In 1530 he\r\nwas Master of the Barber-Surgeons’ Company, and at the head of his\r\nprofession till his death in 1561 or 1562. As Dr. Furnivall says, he\r\nwas “the Paget of his great Tudor time.” Soon after the dissolution of\r\nthe monasteries, Henry VIII., at the request of the City of London,\r\nhanded over the monastic hospitals, Bartholomew’s and others, to the\r\nCorporation of London. He gave to Bartholomew’s a small endowment\r\n(nominally £333 odd) out of old houses which he charged with pensions\r\nto parsons. The city raised £1000 for repairs and reopened the hospital\r\nfor one hundred patients, and on 29th September, 1548, appointed\r\nChief-Surgeon VICARY as one of the six new governors of the hospital.\r\nThe reorganization of the hospital was in a large measure due to this\r\nexcellent man and intelligent surgeon. In 1548 he published the first\r\nEnglish work on Anatomy, _The Anatomie of the Body of Man_, which was\r\nreprinted by the Surgeons of Bartholomew’s in 1577. This text-book held\r\nthe field for 150 years.[842]\r\n\r\nThose who are interested in the origin of our oldest and greatest\r\nhospital in London will find much valuable information in the _Truly\r\nChristian Ordre of the Hospital of S. Bartholomewes_, 1552, published\r\nas Appendix XVI. in Dr. Furnivall’s Vicary, p. 291.\r\n\r\nROBERT COPLAND in 1547 or 48 published his book called _The Hy Way to\r\nthe Spitt House_. This is an important and interesting account of the\r\nscamps and rogues who resorted to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London,\r\nin the time of Henry VIII., after the Statute 22nd Hen. VIII. (1530-1),\r\nagainst vagabonds. At that time the hospital gave temporary lodging to\r\nalmost all the needy, as well as a permanent home to the deserving poor\r\nand sick; and sisters attended to them. Copland learns from the porter\r\nall about the ne’er-do-wells and the rascals who sought to impose on\r\nthe charity.[843]\r\n\r\nThe old herbalists were often very patient and devoted investigators,\r\nwho experimented upon themselves, and by these means accumulated a\r\ngreat number of facts of great use in the art of medicine. Conrad\r\nGesner was one of these; he used to eat small portions of wild herbs,\r\nand test their effects on his own person, sitting down in the study\r\nwith the plants around him.[844]\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM BUTTS, M.D. (died 1545), was physician to Henry VIII., and\r\nwas the friend of Wolsey, Cranmer, and Latimer. He was knighted by\r\nHenry, and is immortalised in Shakspeare’s play of _Henry VIII._\r\n\r\nGEORGE OWEN, M.D. (died 1558), was physician to Henry VIII., Edward\r\nVI., and Queen Mary. It has been said that Edward VI. was brought into\r\nthe world by Dr. Owen, who performed the Cæsarian operation on his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nJOHN CAIUS, M.D. (1510-1573), entered Gonville Hall, Cambridge, 1529.\r\nHe at first studied divinity, but in 1539 went to Padua to study\r\nmedicine under Montanus. Whilst at Padua, Caius lodged in the same\r\nhouse with the anatomist Vesalius, devoting no less attention to\r\nanatomy than his companion. He took the degree of doctor of medicine\r\nat Padua. He was public professor of Greek in that University; in\r\n1543 he visited all the great libraries of Italy, collecting MSS.,\r\nwith the view of giving correct editions of the works of Galen and\r\nCelsus. In 1552 he was residing in London, and published an account\r\nof the Sweating Sickness which prevailed in 1551. He was physician to\r\nEdward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth. Dr. Caius enlarged and augmented the\r\nresources of the college at Cambridge, at which he had been educated;\r\nand he rendered eminent service to the College of Physicians by\r\ndefending its rights against the illegal practices of the surgeons, who\r\ninterfered with the proper functions of the physicians. His munificent\r\nfoundation at Cambridge is a claim on the gratitude of the English\r\nnation, and ensures him a high place for ever in the annals of our\r\nuniversities. The visitor to Cambridge will not fail to remember that\r\nit was he who built the three singular gates at his college, inscribed\r\nto Humility, to Virtue and Wisdom, and to Honour. But he has another\r\nlasting claim to respect on the grounds that he first introduced\r\nthe study of practical anatomy into this country, and was the first\r\npublicly to teach it, which he did in the hall of the Barber-Surgeons,\r\nshortly after his return from Italy. Dr. Caius was a profound classical\r\nscholar, and left numerous works on the Greek and Latin medical\r\nauthors. As a naturalist, linguist, critic, and antiquary, he was no\r\nless distinguished than as a physician.\r\n\r\nEDWARD WOTTON, M.D. (died 1555), seems to have been the first English\r\nphysician who applied himself specially to the study of natural\r\nhistory. He made himself famous by his work on this subject, entitled\r\n_De Differentiis Animalium_.\r\n\r\nDR. GEYNES (died 1563) was cited before the College of Physicians for\r\nimpugning the authority of Galen; he recanted and humbly acknowledged\r\nhis heresy, and was duly pardoned. The circumstance is a curious\r\nillustration of the sentiments of the times.[845]\r\n\r\nSIMON LUDFORD was originally a friar who became an apothecary\r\nin London, who was admitted by the University of Oxford to the\r\nbaccalaureate in medicine, although totally ignorant and incompetent.\r\nThe College reproved the University, and he was compelled to undergo a\r\ncourse of study, when he was ultimately admitted doctor of medicine in\r\nOxford, and Fellow of the College of Physicians in 1563.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM GILBERT, M.D. (born 1540), engaged in experiments relative to\r\nthe magnet, achieving results which Galileo declared to be “great to a\r\ndegree which might be envied,” and which induced Galileo to turn his\r\nmind to magnetism.[846]\r\n\r\nTHOMAS PENNY, M.D. (practised in London, 1570-1). Gerard styles him “a\r\nsecond Dioscorides, for his singular knowledge of plants.” He was also\r\none of the first Englishmen who studied insects.\r\n\r\nPETER TURNER, M.D. (died 1614), was physician to St. Bartholomew’s\r\nHospital, and one of the greatest botanists of his age.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS MUFFET, M.D., the learned friend of distinguished physicians and\r\nnaturalists, was esteemed in his day the famous ornament of the body of\r\nphysicians (died 1604).\r\n\r\nBERENGER OF CAPRI (died 1527) flourished at Bologna (1518). He was a\r\nzealous anatomist, and declared that he had “dissected more than one\r\nhundred human bodies.” He was the first who recognised the larger\r\nproportional size of the male chest than the female, and the converse\r\nconcerning the pelvis. He discovered the two arytenoid cartilages in\r\nthe larynx, first accurately described the thymus, and gave a good\r\ndescription of the brain and the internal ear, in which he noticed the\r\n_malleus_ and _incus_. He rectified some of the mistakes of Mondino,\r\nbut was, like all other anatomists before Harvey, deeply perplexed\r\nabout the heart and the circulation. He investigated the structure of\r\nthe valves of the heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe art of midwifery, up to the middle of the sixteenth century, was\r\nin the lowest possible condition. In 1521, a doctor named Veites was\r\ncondemned to the flames in Hamburg, for engaging in the business of\r\nmidwifery. In the year 1500, the wife of one JACOB NUFER, of Thurgau,\r\na Swiss sow-gelder, being in peril of her life in pregnancy, though\r\nthirteen midwives and several surgeons had attempted to deliver her in\r\nthe ordinary way, it occurred to her husband to ask permission of the\r\nauthorities, and the help of God, to deliver her “as he would a sow.”\r\nHe was completely successful, and thus performed the first Cæsarian\r\noperation on the living patient, who lived to bear several other\r\nchildren in the natural way, and died at the age of seventy-seven.\r\nAnother sow-gelder performed the operation of ovariotomy on his own\r\ndaughter, in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nFRANÇOIS ROUSSET (about 1581), physician to the Duke of Savoy, was the\r\nfirst to write upon the Cæsarian operation. The improvement in printing\r\nand engraving caused the works of the Greek, Roman, and Arabian writers\r\nto be more widely known, and manuals were published for the instruction\r\nof midwives. The first book of this kind was by EUCHARIUS ROSLEIN,\r\nat Worms, called the _Rose Garden for Midwives_ (1513). VESALIUS\r\n(1543) rendered great services to the obstetric art by his anatomical\r\nteaching; and when Rousset published his treatise, the operation became\r\npopular, and was constantly performed on the living subject, sometimes\r\neven when it was not absolutely necessary. PINEAU, a surgeon of Paris,\r\nin 1589, first suggested division of the pubes to facilitate difficult\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the year 1535 (27 Henry VIII.), Wood says[847] that at Oxford\r\n“divers scholars, upon a foresight of the ruin of the clergy, had and\r\ndid now betake themselves to physick, who as yet raw and inexpert\r\nwould adventure to practise, to the utter undoing of many. The said\r\nvisitors ordered, therefore, that none should practise or exercise\r\nthat faculty unless he had been examined by the physick professor\r\nconcerning his knowledge therein. Which order, being of great moment,\r\nwas the year following confirmed by the king, and power by him granted\r\nto the professor and successors to examine those that were to practise\r\naccording to the Visitor’s Order.”\r\n\r\nPIERRE FRANCO (_c._ 1560) was a Swiss or French surgeon, and a famous\r\nlithotomist, who performed the high operation for the first time in\r\n1560, with success, on a child aged two years. Recognising the dangers\r\nof this method, he introduced a new method in the operation known as\r\nperineal lithotomy, which was called the lateral method. He preceded\r\nParé in improvements in dealing with strangulated hernia by the\r\noperation known as herniotomy. He was one of the first to re-introduce\r\ninto midwifery practice the operation known as “turning,” in difficult\r\nlabour. The operation was a familiar one amongst the Hindus, and\r\nhad been known to the later Græco-Roman school, but had fallen into\r\ndisuse until Paré, Franco, and Guillemeau devoted themselves to the\r\nimprovement of this neglected branch of the healing art with great\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nANDREW LIBAVIUS (1546-1616), physician at Coburg, is said by Sprengel\r\nto have been the person who began to cultivate chemistry; as distinct\r\nfrom all theosophical fancies of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nCONRAD GESNER, the miracle of learning, whom we have already mentioned,\r\ndevoted great attention to gynæcology, and wrote learnedly and without\r\nprejudice upon medicine.\r\n\r\nDR. HENRY ALKINS (born 1558) was one of the principal physicians\r\nof James I. While president of the Royal College, the first London\r\nPharmacopœia was published in 1618.\r\n\r\nJOHN BANNISTER was a voluminous writer on surgery who practised in\r\nLondon, and wrote a treatise on surgery in 1575.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS GALE (1507-1586), the “English Paré,” was a military surgeon,\r\nunder Henry VIII. and Elizabeth, who taught that gun-shot wounds were\r\nnot poisoned as was commonly supposed, but were to be treated as\r\nordinary wounds.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BULLEYN (died 1576) was a famous physician and botanist in the\r\nreigns of the later Tudors. He wrote _The Government of Health_ (1548),\r\n_Book of Simples_, and other works.\r\n\r\nFRESCATORIUS (1483-1553) was the first to publish a description of\r\ntyphus fever. Dr. Mead says[848] that he knew that “consumption is\r\ncontagious, and is contracted by living with a phthisical person, by\r\nthe gliding of the corrupted and putrified juices [of the sick] into\r\nthe lungs of the sound man.” He _inferred_ the microbes which we _see_.\r\n\r\nG. BAILLOU (1536-1614) was the first to describe clearly the diseases\r\nwhooping cough and croup.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER BENEDETTI (died 1525) was an anatomist, who made important\r\nobservations on gall-stones.\r\n\r\nFELIX PLATTER (1536-1614), a professor at Basle, must ever be\r\ngratefully remembered for his humane and wise opposition to the cruel\r\ntreatment of the insane by coercive measures, which unhappily were\r\nin fashion up to recent times. He suggested the division of diseases\r\ninto three classes: (1) Mental disorders; (2) Pains, fevers, etc.; (3)\r\nDeformities and defects of secretion.\r\n\r\nA book which contains directions for identifying simples and preparing\r\ncompound medicines is called a Pharmacopœia. The first work of this\r\ncharacter, which was published under Government authority, was that\r\nof Nuremberg, in 1512. A student, VALERIUS CORDUS, passing through\r\nthe city, exhibited a recipe book, which he had compiled from the\r\nwritings of the most eminent physicians of the town. He was urged to\r\nprint it for the benefit of the apothecaries. The College of Medicine\r\nat Florence issued the _Antidotarium Florentinum_, somewhat earlier,\r\nbut merely on its own authority. Dr. A. Foes used the term pharmacopœia\r\nfirst as a distinct title for his work published at Basle, in 1561.[849]\r\n\r\nCOSTANZO VAROLIUS of Bologna (1545-1575), one of the greatest of the\r\nItalian anatomists, described the optic nerves and many important\r\npoints in the anatomy of the brain.\r\n\r\nVOLCHER COITER, of Groningen (1534-1600), was a pupil of Fallopius and\r\nEustachius, who was distinguished for his important researches on the\r\ncartilages, bones, nerves, and the anatomy of the fœtal skeleton.\r\n\r\nFABRICIUS, of Acquapendente (1537-1619), a pupil of Fallopius, and a\r\ndistinguished anatomist, made important researches on the structure of\r\nanimals in general. His famous discovery of the valves of the veins\r\nand his investigations concerning their use led Harvey to make the\r\ndiscovery of the circulation of the blood.\r\n\r\nCASSERIUS (1561-1616) investigated the anatomy of the vocal organs,\r\ndiscovered the muscles of the ossicles of the ear, and practised\r\nbronchotomy, which he had learned from Fabricius. He was professor at\r\nPadua, and a teacher of Harvey.\r\n\r\nSPIGEL (1578-1625) made researches on the liver, a lobulus of which\r\nbears his name.\r\n\r\nOLAUS WORM (1588-1654) first described the small bones of the skull,\r\nnow called “Wormian” bones.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the sixteenth century that France contributed her\r\nquota to the list of great anatomists. Nothing shows more clearly the\r\ndifficulty with which learning was spread in the times of which we\r\nwrite than the fact that the works of the early Italian anatomists were\r\naltogether unknown in France until a hundred years after they were\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nJACQUES DUBOIS (1478-1555) taught anatomy at Paris, and was professor\r\nof surgery to the Royal College. He was an irrational admirer of Galen.\r\nThe carcases of dogs and other animals were the materials from which\r\nhe taught; it does not appear that it was possible to obtain human\r\nsubjects for dissection without robbing the cemeteries.\r\n\r\nCHARLES ETIENNE (1503-64) was the first to detect valves in the\r\norifices of the hepatic veins. He knew nothing of the researches of\r\nAchillini concerning the brain, although they were made sixty years\r\nbefore; yet his investigations of the structure of the nervous system\r\nwere most important, and his demonstration of the existence of a canal\r\nrunning through the whole length of the spinal cord, which had not\r\npreviously been suspected, entitles him to a high place in the history\r\nof anatomy.\r\n\r\nA new era in the history of anatomy was inaugurated by the appearance\r\nof ANDREW VESALIUS (1514-1564), a Fleming, who pursued the study with\r\nthe greatest assiduity at Venice, and demonstrated it at Padua before\r\nhe was twenty-two. He remained there seven years, then went to Bologna\r\nand thence to Pisa. He is known as the first author of a systematic and\r\ncomprehensive view of human anatomy. He recognised the necessity of\r\ndivesting the science of the current misrepresentations of ignorance\r\nand fancy.\r\n\r\nVesalius especially contributed to our knowledge of the circulatory\r\norgans; it was he who, by his study of the structure of the heart and\r\nthe mechanism of its valves, stimulated his pupils and fellow-students\r\nto pursue a course of research which ended at last in Harvey’s immortal\r\ndiscovery. Besides these researches on the vascular system, he first\r\naccurately described the sphenoid bone and the sternum. He described\r\nthe omentum, the pylorus, the mediastinum and pleura, and gave the\r\nfullest description of the brain which, up to that time, had appeared.\r\nSplendid as were his researches, and valuable as were his writings, it\r\nwas perhaps by the way in which he stimulated inquiry in others that he\r\nrendered the greatest services to anatomical science.\r\n\r\nDr. Molony, writing in the _British Medical Journal_, December 31,\r\n1892, says: “I recently secured possession of his works, entitled\r\n_Andreæ Vesalii Invictissimi Caroli V. Imperatoris Medici Opera Omnia_.\r\nIt is a curious work in two immense folio volumes, written in fairly\r\ngood Latin. It has several plates representing the surgical instruments\r\nof the period, dissections, and, it must be added, quadrupeds of all\r\nsorts tied up evidently awaiting vivisection.\r\n\r\n“The preface consists of a lengthy and appreciative life of Vesalius,\r\nfrom which it seems that he was born in 1514, at Brussels, where his\r\nfather was court physician. As a boy he seems to have shown a taste for\r\ncomparative anatomy, ‘puer animalium penetralia nudare atque viscera\r\ninspicere soleret.’ His anatomical studies were at all times pursued\r\nunder difficulties. He obtained the bodies of criminals by bribing\r\nthe judges, ‘corpora nactus eorum, in cubicula vexit, suosque in usus\r\nper tres et ultra septimanas asservavit. Horretne legenti animus? O\r\njuvenilis ardor, repagula eluctatur ferrea! Tali opus erat ingenio,\r\nartibus bis, at nobile conderet opus.’ He does not seem to have been\r\nmarried, if we may judge from the following extract: ‘Aetate vero\r\nintegra, uxore, liberis, rei familiaris omni cura liber, totum se\r\nimmersit in anatomicis.’\r\n\r\n“Vesalius was an enthusiastic surgeon, and apparently looked down\r\nupon the physicians of the period: ‘Jocatus medicos reliquos syrupis\r\npræscribendis unice occupari.’ His success aroused the jealousy of his\r\ncontemporaries. Among others he came into collision with Sylvius of\r\nParis, Eustachius of Rome, and Fallopius of Padua. Mention is also made\r\nof ‘Joannis Caji Medici Celebris Britanni.’ It would be interesting to\r\nascertain who this was. [No doubt it was Caius.]\r\n\r\n“The end of Vesalius was tragic enough. ‘Hispanum curabat nobilem\r\npetiit ab amicis defuncti corpus aperire ut mortis scrutaretur causam.\r\nQuo concesso, visum cor in aperto jam pectore adhuc palpitans.’ The\r\npunishment ordered for this was a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. On his\r\nreturn voyage he was wrecked on the island of Zacinthus. ‘Inops, in\r\nloco solitario, omnique carens subsidio miserabiliter vitam finivit\r\n1564.’”\r\n\r\n“VESALIUS,” says Portal, “appears to me one of the greatest men who\r\never existed. Let the astronomers vaunt their Copernicus, the natural\r\nphilosophers their Galileo and Torricelli, the mathematicians their\r\nPascal, the geographers their Columbus, I shall always place Vesalius\r\nabove all their heroes. The first study for man is man. Vesalius has\r\nthis noble object in view, and has admirably attained it; he has made\r\non himself and his fellows such discoveries as Columbus could only\r\nmake by travelling to the extremity of the world. The discoveries of\r\nVesalius are of direct importance to man; by acquiring fresh knowledge\r\nof his own structure, man seems to enlarge his existence; while\r\ndiscoveries in geography or astronomy affect him but in a very indirect\r\nmanner.”\r\n\r\nThe zeal of Vesalius and his fellow-students of anatomy often led\r\nthem to weird adventures. Hallam says:[850] “they prowled by night in\r\ncharnel-houses, they dug up the dead from the graves, they climbed the\r\ngibbet, in fear and silence, to steal the mouldering carcase of the\r\nmurderer; the risk of ignominious punishment, and the secret stings of\r\nsuperstitious remorse, exalting no doubt the delight of these useful\r\nbut not very enviable pursuits.” Vesalius, as has been said above,\r\nwas once absurdly accused of dissecting a Spanish gentleman before he\r\nwas dead. He only escaped the punishment of death by undertaking a\r\npilgrimage to Jerusalem, during which he was shipwrecked, and died of\r\nfamine in one of the Greek islands.[851]\r\n\r\nGABRIEL FALLOPIUS (1523-1562) was a prominent pupil of Vesalius who\r\nstudied the anastomoses (the blending together) of the blood-vessels.\r\nHis researches in the anatomy of the bones and the internal ear greatly\r\nadvanced anatomical knowledge. He discovered the tubes connected\r\nwith the womb, called after him the “Fallopian tubes.” Fallopius is\r\ndescribed as a savant distinguished by his sense of justice, his\r\nmodesty and gentleness; yet Dr. Baas says,[852] “the fact that even\r\nFallopio did not shrink from accepting the gift of some convicts, and\r\nthen poisoning them—indeed, when the first experiment proved a failure,\r\nhe tried it again with better success—is characteristic of the zeal of\r\nthe age in the investigation of the human body, and of the barbarous\r\nidea that might makes right towards those guilty before the law!”\r\n\r\nEUSTACHIUS was a contemporary of Vesalius. He divides with him the\r\nhonour of having created the science of human anatomy. His name is\r\nperpetuated by the tube in the internal ear, called the “Eustachian\r\ntube.” His researches on the anatomy of the internal part of the organ\r\nof hearing, his studies in the anatomy of the teeth, in which he was\r\nthe pioneer, his famous _Anatomical Engravings_, and his labours in\r\nconnection with the intimate structure of the organs of the body, taken\r\nin connection with their relative anatomy, prove that he laboured for\r\nthe advancement of the knowledge of the structure of the human frame\r\nwith the utmost assiduity and success.\r\n\r\nJ. C. ARANZI (1530-1589), of Bologna, gave the first correct account of\r\nthe anatomy of the fœtus, and his description of that of the brain is\r\nexceedingly minute and lucid. He named the _hippocampus_, described the\r\nchoroid plexus, and the fourth ventricle under the name of the _cistern\r\nof the cerebellum_.\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS (died 1559) was a pupil of Vesalius, whom he succeeded in the\r\nchair of anatomy at Padua. He had a glimpse of how the blood passes\r\nfrom the right to the left side of the heart, but he had no true\r\nknowledge of the circulation.\r\n\r\n_Michael Servetus_ (1511-1553) was either a pupil or fellow-student of\r\nVesalius, who, in 1553, described accurately the pulmonary circulation.\r\nHe recognised that the change from venous into arterial blood took\r\nplace in the lungs, and not in the left ventricle. He was a pioneer in\r\nphysiological science by his great discovery of the respiratory changes\r\nin the lungs.\r\n\r\nLEVASSEUR (about 1540), says Hallam,[853] appears to have known the\r\ncirculation of the blood through the lungs, the valves of the veins,\r\nand their direction and purpose.\r\n\r\nGASPARE TAGLIACOZZI (1546-1599) was a professor at Bologna, whose\r\nname is famous in the history of surgery from his skill in performing\r\n“plastic operations.” Rhinoplastic operation is a term in surgery\r\nsometimes synonymous with the Taliacotian operation, which is a process\r\nfor forming an artificial nose. It consists in bringing down a piece\r\nof flesh from the forehead, and while preserving its attachment to\r\nthe living structures, causing it to adhere to the anterior part of\r\nthe remains of the nose. Tagliacozzi, himself, to replace the lost\r\nsubstance employed the skin of the upper part of the arm, as BRANCA\r\ndid previously. Patients flocked to him from all parts of Europe. The\r\nworld was, as usual, ungrateful; the great surgeon was considered to\r\nhave presumptuously interfered with the authority of Providence. Noses\r\nand lips which the Divinity had destroyed as a punishment for the sins\r\nof men had been restored by this daring man. After his death some nuns\r\nheard voices in their convent crying for several weeks: “Tagliacozzi is\r\ndamned!” By the direction of the clergy of Bologna his corpse was taken\r\nfrom the grave and re-interred in unconsecrated ground.[854] We are not\r\nin a position to sneer at this, for the preachers of the nineteenth\r\ncentury said something very similar of the use of chloroform in\r\nmidwifery only a few years ago. In 1742 the Faculty of Paris declared\r\nTagliacozzi’s operation impossible; but the English journals, in 1794,\r\ndiscovered that such a method of surgical procedure had been in use\r\nin India from ancient times, and then the scientific world tried the\r\nexperiment and succeeded perfectly.\r\n\r\nAMBROISE PARÉ, “the father of French surgery” (1509-1590), availed\r\nhimself of the opportunities offered him in military surgery during the\r\ncampaign of Francis I. in Piedmont. It was the practice of the time to\r\ntreat gunshot wounds with hot oil—a treatment which Paré revolutionized\r\nby using merely a simple bandage.\r\n\r\nIn 1545 he attended the lectures of Sylvius at Paris, and became\r\nprosector to that great anatomist. His book on _Anatomy_ was published\r\nfive years later. By his employment of the ligature for large arteries,\r\nhe was able so completely to control hæmorrhage that he was able to\r\npractise amputation on a larger scale than had before been attempted.\r\nParé is considered as the first who regularly employed the ligature\r\nafter amputation. He declares in his _Apologie_ that the invention\r\nwas due to the ancients, and he explains their use of it, although he\r\nascribes to inspiration of the Deity his own first adoption of the\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThe PHILOSOPHER RAMUS in 1562 urged Charles IX. of France to establish\r\nschools for clinical teaching, such as already existed at Padua.\r\n\r\nROBERT FLUDD, M.D., or in the Latin style he affected, _Robertus\r\nde Fluctibus_, was born in 1574; he was an ardent supporter of the\r\nRosicrucian philosophy. He had a strong leaning towards chemistry, but\r\nhad little faith in orthodox medicine. His medical ideas consisted of\r\na mysterious mixture of divinity, chemistry, natural philosophy, and\r\nmetaphysics.\r\n\r\nIn 1573, Harrison, in his unpublished _Chronologie_, remarks that\r\n“these daies the taking in of the smoke of the Indian herb called\r\ntabaco, by an instrument like a little ladell, is gretly taken up and\r\nused in England against rewmes.”\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1576 that croup was well understood. Laënnec thinks it\r\nwas quite unknown to the Greek and Arabian physicians; but Forbes says\r\nthat it was known to Hippocrates and Aretæus, although its pathology\r\nwas not understood. Ballonius was the first who accurately described\r\nthe false membrane, which is a characteristic of the disease.[855]\r\n\r\nAt the Reformation in England under Elizabeth, some of the Catholic\r\npriests who refused to conform to the new religion sought in other\r\nprofessions the means of living. In a curious old book, _Tom of all\r\nTrades, or the Plaine Pathway to Preferment_, by Thomas Powell (printed\r\n1631), there is a story which no doubt was founded in fact. “And heere\r\nI remember me of an old tale following, _viz._, At the beginning of the\r\nhappy raigne of our late good Queene _Elizabeth_, divers Commissioners\r\nof great place, being authorized to enquire of, and to displace, all\r\nsuch of the _Clergie_ as would not conforme to the reformed _Church_,\r\none amongst others was Conuented before them, who being asked whether\r\nhe would subscribe or no, denied it, and so consequently was adiudged\r\nto lose his benefice and to be deprived his function; wherevpon, in\r\nhis impatience, he said, ‘That if they (meaning the Commissioners)\r\nheld this course it would cost many a man’s life.’ For which the\r\nCommissioners called him backe againe, and charged him that he had\r\nspoke treasonable and seditious words, tending to the raysing of a\r\nrebellion or some tumult in the Land; for which he should receive the\r\nreward of a Traytor. And being asked whether hee spake those words or\r\nno, he acknowledged it, and tooke vpon him the Iustification thereof;\r\n‘for, said he, ‘yee have taken from me my liuing and profession of the\r\nMinistrie; Schollership is all my portion, and I have no other meanes\r\nnow left for my maintenance but to turn _Phisition_; and before I\r\nshalbe absolute Master of that Misterie (God he knowes) how many mens\r\nlives it will cost. For few _Phisitions_ vse to try experiments vpon\r\ntheir owne bodies.’\r\n\r\n“With vs, it is a Profession can maintaine but a few. And diuers of\r\nthose more indebted to opinion than learning, and (for the most part)\r\nbetter qualified in discoursing their travailes than in discerning\r\ntheir patients malladies. For it is growne to be a very huswiues trade,\r\nwhere fortune prevailes more than skill.”\r\n\r\nA writer in Hood’s _Every-Day Book_, on the date February 25, says\r\nthat the monks knew of more than three hundred species of medicinal\r\nplants which were used in general for medicines by the religious\r\norders before the Reformation. The Protestants, the more efficiently to\r\nroot out Popery, changed the Catholic names of many of these. Thus the\r\n_virgin’s bower_ of the monastic physician was changed into _flammula\r\nJovis_; the _hedge hyssop_ into _gratiola_; _St. John’s wort_ became\r\n_hypericum_; _fleur de St. Louis_ was called _iris_; _palma Christi_\r\nbecame _ricinus_; _Our Master wort_ was christened _imperatona_;\r\n_sweet bay_ they called _laurus_; _Our Lady’s smock_ was changed into\r\n_cardamine_; _Solomon’s seal_ into _convallaria_; _Our Lady’s hair_\r\ninto _trichomanes_; _balm_ into _melissa_; _marjoram_ into _origanum_;\r\n_herb Trinity_ into _viola tricolor_; _knee holy_ into _rascus_;\r\n_rosemary_ into _rosmarinus_; _marygold_ into _calendula_; and a\r\nhundred others. But the old Catholic names cling to the plants of the\r\ncottage garden, and _Star of Bethlehem_ has not quite given place to\r\n_ornithogalum_; _Star of Jerusalem_ to _goat’s beard_; nor _Lent lily_\r\nto _daffodil_.\r\n\r\nThe gullibility of mankind has never been exhibited in a clearer\r\nlight than JOHANN VALENTIN ANDREÆ (1586-1654) succeeded in showing\r\nin his elaborate joke of the SOCIETY OF THE ROSY-CROSS. In 1614 a\r\nfamous but entirely fabulous secret society set the scholars of Europe\r\ndiscussing the pretensions of the Rosicrucians, who were said to have\r\nderived their origin from one CHRISTIAN ROSENKREUZ, two hundred years\r\npreviously. This philosopher, it was said, had made a pilgrimage to\r\nthe East, to learn its hidden wisdom, of which the art of making\r\ngold was a portion. The character of the society was Christian, but\r\nanti-Catholic, and its ostensible objects were the study of philosophy\r\nand the gratuitous healing of the sick. Its device was a cross, with\r\nfour red roses. Andreæ was a learned man, but jocular withal; for no\r\nsooner had the public eagerly swallowed his story, than he confessed\r\nthe whole was pure invention, and that he had originated the idea with\r\nthe view of ridiculing the alchemists and Theosophists, whose opinions\r\nwere dominating European society. The public, however, liked the idea\r\nso well that it developed and flourished, and a society was established\r\ncalled _Fraternitas Rosæ Crucis_. The most celebrated followers of\r\nthe Rosicrucians were Valentine Wiegel, Jacob Boehm, Egidius Gutman,\r\nMichael Mayer, Oswald Crollius, and Robert Fludd.[856]\r\n\r\nDe Quincey has traced the connection between the Rosicrucians and\r\nFreemasons. “Rosicrucianism,” he says, “it is true, is not Freemasonry,\r\nbut the latter borrowed its form from the first.”[857]\r\n\r\nScrofula was anciently treated in a superstitious manner by the\r\nsovereigns of England and France by imposition of hands. This ceremony\r\nis said to have been first performed by Edward the Confessor\r\n(1042-1066). A special “Service of Healing” was used in the English\r\nChurch in the reign of Henry VIII. (1484-1509).\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies of blessing cramp-rings on Good Friday, called the\r\nHallowing of the Cramp-Rings, is described by Bishop Percy in his\r\n_Northumberland Household Book_,[858] where we have the following\r\naccount:—\r\n\r\n“And then the Usher to lay a Carpett for the Kinge to Creepe to the\r\nCrosse upon. And that done, there shal be a Forme sett upon the\r\nCarpett, before the Crucifix, and a Cushion laid upon it for the King\r\nto kneale upon. And the Master of the Jewell Howse ther to be ready\r\nwith the Booke concerninge the Hallowing of the Crampe Rings, and\r\nAmner (Almoner) muste kneele on the right hand of the Kinge, holdinge\r\nthe sayde booke. When that is done the King shall rise and goe to the\r\nAlter, wheare a Gent. Usher shall be redie with a Cushion for the Kinge\r\nto kneele upon; and then the greatest Lords that shall be ther to take\r\nthe Bason with the Rings and beare them after the Kinge to offer.”\r\n\r\nIn the Harleian Manuscripts there is a letter from Lord Chancellor\r\nHatton to Sir Thomas Smith, dated Sept, 11th, 158-, about a prevailing\r\nepidemic, and enclosing a ring for Queen Elizabeth to wear between\r\nher breasts, the said ring having “the virtue to expell infectious\r\nairs.”[859]\r\n\r\nAndrew Boorde, in his _Introduction to Knowledge_ (1547-48), says: “The\r\nKynges of England by the power that God hath gyuen to them, dothe make\r\nsicke men whole of a sickeness called the kynges euyll. The Kynges of\r\nEngland doth halowe euery yere crampe rynges, the whyche rynges, worne\r\non ones fynger, dothe helpe them the whyche hath the crampe.”[860]\r\n\r\nConcerning the king’s evil, which Boorde explains is an “euyl sickenes\r\nor impediment,” he advises: “For this matter let euery man make frendes\r\nto the Kynges maiestie, for it doth pertayne to a Kynge to helpe this\r\ninfirmitie by the grace the whiche is geuen to a Kynge anoynted.”[861]\r\n\r\nIn Robert Laneham’s letter[862] about Queen Elizabeth’s visit to\r\nKenilworth Castle, it is told how on July 18th, 1575, her Majesty\r\ntouched for the evil, and that it was “a day of grace.” “By her\r\nhighnes accustumed mercy and charitee, nyne cured of the peynfull and\r\ndaungerous diseaz, called the kings euill; for that Kings and Queenz of\r\nthis Realm withoout oother medsin (saue only by handling and prayerz)\r\nonly doo cure it.”\r\n\r\nSir John Fortescue, in his defence of the House of Lancaster against\r\nthat of York, argued that the crown could not descend to a female\r\nbecause the Queen is not qualified by the form of anointing her to\r\ncure the disease called the king’s evil. On this account, and more\r\nespecially after the excommunication of Elizabeth by the Pope in 1570,\r\nit must have been eminently comforting to all concerned to find that\r\nthe power to cure disease by the royal touch had not been affected by\r\nthe change of religion or any other cause. The practice was at its\r\nheight in the reign of Charles II.[863]\r\n\r\nLord Braybrooke says,[864] “In the first four years after his\r\nrestoration he ‘touched’ nearly 24,000 people.” We find that Dr.\r\nJohnson was touched by Queen Anne. “The Office for the Healing”\r\ncontinued to be printed in the Book of Common Prayer after the\r\naccession of the House of Hanover.\r\n\r\nThe custom evidently arose from the fact that Edward the Confessor\r\nwas a saint as well as a king. William of Malmesbury gives the origin\r\nof the royal touch in his account of the miracles of Edward: “A young\r\nwoman had married a husband of her own age, but having no issue by\r\nthe union, the humours collecting abundantly about her neck, she had\r\ncontracted a sore disorder, the glands swelling in a dreadful manner.\r\nAdmonished in a dream to have the part affected washed by the king,\r\nshe entered the palace, and the king himself fulfilled this labour of\r\nlove, by rubbing the woman’s neck with his fingers dipped in water.\r\nJoyous health followed his healing hand; the lurid skin opened, so that\r\nworms flowed out with the purulent matter, and the tumour subsided.\r\nBut as the orifice of the ulcers was large and unsightly, he commanded\r\nher to be supported at the royal expense till she should be perfectly\r\ncured. However, before a week was expired, a fair new skin returned,\r\nand hid the scars so completely, that nothing of the original wound\r\ncould be discovered; and within a year becoming the mother of twins,\r\nshe increased the admiration of Edward’s holiness. Those who knew him\r\nmore intimately, affirm that he often cured this complaint in Normandy;\r\nwhence appears how false is their notion, who in our times assert, that\r\nthe cure of this disease does not proceed from personal sanctity, but\r\nfrom hereditary virtue in the royal line.”[865]\r\n\r\nMany other miracles of healing were attributed to St. Edward. Jeremy\r\nCollier[866] maintains that the scrofula miracle is hereditary upon\r\nall his successors. The curious fact, however, is that the hereditary\r\nright of succession was repeatedly interrupted, yet the power remained.\r\nIn connection with this royal touching, pieces of gold were given by\r\nthe sovereigns to be worn by the patients as amulets. They were called\r\n“touching pieces,” and though not absolutely requisite for the cure,\r\nsome persons declared that the disease returned if they lost the coins.\r\nWe can only account for the great efficacy which in some cases seemed\r\nto have attended the royal treatment, by the confidence and exalted\r\nexpectation awakened in the sufferers by the ceremony, which acted as a\r\ntonic to the system, and roused the patients’ imagination to contribute\r\nto their own cure.[867]\r\n\r\nChips and handkerchiefs dipped in the blood of King Charles I. are said\r\nto have been efficacious in curing sick persons in hundreds of cases.\r\n\r\nThe College of Physicians of Edinburgh was created by the king’s\r\nletters patent in 1581, one year after the foundation of Edinburgh\r\nUniversity by James VI.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Elizabeth, when physicians rode on horseback, they were\r\nseated sideways; many of them carried muffs, to keep their fingers warm\r\nwhen they had to feel their patient’s pulse. Twice a year everybody was\r\nbled—a system which must have caused many disorders.\r\n\r\nFifteen centuries after the age of CELSUS, with the revival of learning\r\nand science came the revival of human vivisection. VESALIUS, as\r\nabove mentioned, is known to have vivisected men; and in the _Storia\r\nUniversale_ of CESARE CANTÙ there is an account of the DUKE OF FLORENCE\r\ngiving a man for vivisection to FALLOPIUS. This incident has been\r\ndisputed; but the following series of cases, extracted by Professor\r\nANDREOZZI from the Criminal Archives of Florence, and published by him\r\nin his book _Leggi Penali degli antichi e Cinesi_, are beyond question.\r\nCOSMO DE MEDICI seems to have taken the anatomists of Pisa under his\r\nspecial favour, and to have sent them the miserable convicts from the\r\nprisons at his option. The following examples are a selection from the\r\ncases extracted by Signor ANDREOZZI from the _Archivio Criminale_:—\r\n\r\n“1. January 15th, 1545.—SANTA DI MARIOTTO TARCHI DI MUGELLO, wife of\r\nBASTIANO LUCCHESE, was condemned to be beheaded for infanticide. Under\r\nthe sentence is written, ‘Dicta Santa, de mente Excell^{mi} Ducis, fuit\r\nmissa Pisis, de ea per doctores fieret notomia.’[No notice to be found\r\nof any execution of the woman, such as would have appeared had she been\r\nput to death before she was sent to Pisa.]\r\n\r\n“2. December 14th, 1547.—GIULIO MANCINI SANESE was condemned for\r\nrobbery and other offences. Sent to Pisa to be anatomised. ‘Ducatur\r\nPisis, pro faciendo de eo notomia.’\r\n\r\n“3. In the record of prisoners sent away, dated September 1st, 1551,\r\noccurs this entry:—‘Letter to the Commissioner of Castrocaro, that\r\nMADDALENA, who is imprisoned for killing her son, should be sent here,\r\nif she be likely to recover, as it pleases S. E. that she should be\r\nreserved for anatomy. Of this nothing is to be said, but she is to be\r\nkept in hopes. If she is not likely to recover, the executioner is\r\nto be sent for to decapitate her.’ The end of the horrible extract\r\nis,—‘Went to Pisa, to be made an anatomy.’\r\n\r\n“4. December 12th, 1552.—A man named ZUCCHERIA, accused of piracy, was\r\nreserved from hanging, with his comrade, and sent to Pisa, ‘per la\r\nnotomia.’\r\n\r\n“5. December 22nd, 1552.—A certain ULIVO DI PAOLO was condemned by\r\nthe Council of Eight to be hanged for poisoning his wife. Sentence\r\nchanged—to be sent for anatomy. Was sent to Pisa on January 13th.\r\n\r\n“6. November 14th, 1553.—MARGUERITA, wife of BIAJIO D’ANTINORO,\r\ncondemned to be beheaded for infanticide.... December 20th, ‘she was\r\nreleased from the fetters and consigned to a familiar, who took her to\r\nPisa to the Commissario, _who gave her, as usual, to the anatomist, to\r\nmake anatomy of her_; which was done’ (‘che la consegni, secondo il\r\nsolito, al notomista, per farne notomia, come fu fatto’).”\r\n\r\n“Several other cases, from 1554 to 1570, are recorded, with equally\r\nunmistakable exactitude. In one instance the condemned man’s destiny\r\nwas mitigated, and after having been ordered to be sent to Pisa for\r\nthe Commissario to consign to the anatomist, ‘when he should ask for\r\nhim, and at his pleasure,’ he was mercifully sentenced to be hanged\r\nat once at Vico, ‘by direction of Sua Excellenza Illustrissima.’ Two\r\nunfortunate thieves, PAOLI DI GIOVANNI and VESTRINO D’AGNOLO, were sent\r\ntogether by the Council of Eight to be anatomised; the Duke having\r\nwritten to say ‘that they wanted in Pisa a subject for anatomy.’”\r\n\r\nAfter the date 1570 no more cases occur in the Archives.\r\n\r\nFrancis I. invited the Italian anatomist VIDUS VIDIUS to his royal\r\ncollege at Paris.\r\n\r\nSeveral new medicines were introduced about this period.\r\n\r\nLemon juice was first spoken of as a remedy for scurvy in 1564. Its use\r\nwas discovered by some Dutch sailors whose ship was laden with lemons\r\nand oranges from Spain.[868]\r\n\r\nThe virtues of sassafras as a medicine for scurvy were discovered,\r\naccording to Cartier, in 1536, on a voyage to explore the coast of\r\nNewfoundland and the St. Lawrence. The natives advised the sailors\r\nafflicted with the malady to use the wood of the tree ameda, which was\r\nthought to have been sassafras.[869]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF A DOCTOR’S HOUSE.\r\n\r\nFacsimile of a miniature from the _Epistre de Othea_, by Christine de\r\nPisan. (Fifteenth century MS. in Burgundy Library, Brussels.)\r\n                                                         [_Face p._ 374]\r\n\r\nSarsaparilla was first brought to Europe by the Spaniards, in the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century, from Peru and Brazil.\r\n\r\nGuaiacum was introduced into Europe in 1509, and in 1519 its use became\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nHolinshed complained[870] that estimation and credit given to compound\r\nmedicines made with foreign drugs in his time was one great cause of\r\nthe prevailing ignorance of the virtues and uses of “our own simples,”\r\nwhich he held to be fully as useful as the “salsa parilla, mochoacan,\r\netc.,” so much in request. “We tread those herbs under our feet, whose\r\nforces, if we knew and could apply them to our necessities, we would\r\nhonour and have in reverence.—Alas! what have we to do with such\r\nArabian and Grecian stuff as is daily brought from those parts which\r\nlie in another clime?—The bodies of such as dwell there are of another\r\nconstitution than ours are here at home. Certes, they grow not for us,\r\nbut for the Arabians and Grecians.—Among the Indians, who have the most\r\npresent cures for every disease of their own nation, there is small\r\nregard of compound medicines, and less of foreign drugs, because they\r\nneither know them nor can use them, but work wonders even with their\r\nown simples.”\r\n\r\nCARLO RUINI, of Bologna, published in 1598 a work on the anatomy of the\r\nhorse, in which Ercolani has found evidence that he, to some extent,\r\nanticipated Harvey’s discovery.[871]\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS HOUEL (1520-1585) was born at Paris, 1520. He was a famous\r\nand learned pharmacien, who devoted the fortune which he acquired by\r\nhis industry and skill to philanthropic and scientific purposes. He\r\nfounded a great orphanage in Paris, and the School of Pharmacy of that\r\ncity owes its origin to him. He wrote a _Treatise on the Plague_, and\r\none on the _Theriacum of Mithridates_, both published in 1573. It is to\r\nhis enlightened and charitable suggestion that dispensaries arose in\r\nParis. His “Garden of Simples” inspired the creation of the _Jardin des\r\nPlantes_.[872]\r\n\r\nEven at the close of the sixteenth century careful and sober men, as\r\nMr. Henry Morley says,[873] believed in the miraculous properties of\r\nplants and animals and parts of animals. When the century commenced,\r\nthe learned and unlearned alike believed in the influences of the stars\r\nand the interferences of demons with diseases, and in the mysteries\r\nof magic. The reason why students of such sciences as existed were\r\npunished and persecuted was the dread which men had that the knowledge\r\nof the occult powers of nature would afford the learner undue and\r\nmysterious power over them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGAL MEDICINE.\r\n\r\nThat most important branch of medical science known as Medical\r\nJurisprudence, or Forensic Medicine, first took its rise in Germany,\r\nand, later, was recognised as a necessary branch of study in England.\r\nBriefly this science may be described as “that branch of State medicine\r\nwhich treats of the application of medical knowledge to the purposes\r\nof the law.” It embraces all questions affecting the civil or social\r\nrights of individuals, and of injuries to the person. Although we\r\nfind traces of the first principles of this science in ancient times,\r\nespecially in connection with legitimacy, feigned diseases, etc., it\r\nis by no means certain that even in Rome the law required any medical\r\ninspection of dead bodies. The science dates only from the sixteenth\r\ncentury. The Bishop of Bamberg, in 1507, introduced a penal code\r\nrequiring the production of medical evidence in certain cases. In\r\n1532, Charles V. induced the Diet of Ratison to adopt a code in which\r\nmagistrates were ordered to call medical evidence in cases of personal\r\ninjuries, infanticide, pretended pregnancy, simulated diseases, and\r\npoisoning. The actual birth of forensic medicine, however, did not take\r\nplace until the publication, in Germany, in 1553, of the _Constitutio\r\nCriminalis Carolina_.[874] The difficulties which the infant science\r\nhad to contend against may be estimated from the fact that a few years\r\nlater a physician named Weiker, who declared that witches and demoniacs\r\nwere simply persons afflicted with hypochondriasis and hysteria, and\r\nshould not be punished, was with difficulty saved from the stake by his\r\npatron, William, Duke of Cleves.\r\n\r\nAMBROSE PARÉ wrote on monsters, simulated diseases, and the art of\r\ndrawing up medico-legal reports.\r\n\r\nIn 1621-35 Paulo Zacchia, of Rome, published a work entitled\r\n_Quæstiones Medico-Legales_, which inaugurated a new era in the\r\nhistory of Forensic Medicine. He exhibited immense research in this\r\nclassical work, the materials for which he collected from 460 authors.\r\nConsidering that chemistry and physiology were then so imperfectly\r\nunderstood, such a work is a proof of the learning and sagacity of the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nIn 1663 the Danish physician Bartholin proposed the hydrostatic\r\ntest for the determination of live-birth, the method used to-day in\r\nexamining the lungs of an infant to discover whether the child was born\r\nalive or not, by observing whether they float or sink in water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n Bacon and the Inductive Method.—Descartes and\r\n Physiology.—Newton.—Boyle and the Royal Society.—The Founders of the\r\n Schools of Medical Science.—Sydenham, the English Hippocrates.—Harvey\r\n and the Rise of Physiology.—The Microscope in Medicine.—Willis and the\r\n Reform of Materia Medica.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century is important in the history of medicine as\r\nthe era of the two greatest discoveries of modern physiology—the\r\ncirculation of the blood, and the development of the higher animals\r\nfrom the egg (ovum). Both of these are due to Harvey, and both were\r\nmade in the midst of the troubles of the great Civil War. The history\r\nof medicine is so interwoven at this important period with that of\r\nscience and philosophy in general, that it is necessary to glance\r\nawhile at the great factors which were working out the advancement of\r\nmedical learning.\r\n\r\nAmongst the greatest figures on the scientific stage at the beginning\r\nand middle of the seventeenth century are the following:—\r\n\r\nFRANCIS BACON (1561-1626) was the great leader in the reformation of\r\nmodern science, and shares with Descartes the glory of inaugurating\r\nmodern philosophy. His great work, the _Novum Organon_, was given to\r\nthe world just as authority and dogmatism had been discarded from\r\nscientific thought, and the era of experiment had begun. It was not\r\nBacon’s contributions to science, not his discoveries, which entitle\r\nhim to the highest place in the reformation of science, but the\r\ngeneral spirit of his philosophy and his connected mode of thinking,\r\nhis insistence upon the need for rejecting rash generalization, and\r\nanalysing our experience, employing hypothesis, not by guess work,\r\nbut by the scientific imagination which calls to its assistance\r\nexperimental comparison, verification, and proof. Bacon’s philosophy of\r\ninduction was reared upon a foundation of exclusion and elimination. He\r\nrelegated theological questions to the region of faith, insisting that\r\nexperience and observation are the only remedies against prejudice and\r\nerror.[875]\r\n\r\nThe publication of Bacon’s _Novum Organon_ in 1620 resulted in the\r\nformation of a society of learned men, who met together in London in\r\n1645 to discuss philosophical subjects and the results of their various\r\nexperiments in science. They are described as “inquisitive,” a term\r\nwhich aptly illustrates the temper of the times. Taking nothing upon\r\ntrust, these men inquired for themselves, and left their books to make\r\nexperiment, as Bacon had urged students of nature to do. About 1648-9\r\nDRS. WILKINS, WALLIS, and others removed to Oxford, and with SETH WARD,\r\nthe HON. ROBERT BOYLE, PETTY, and other men of divinity and physic,\r\noften met in the rooms of DR. WILKINS at Wadham College, and so formed\r\nthe Philosophical Society of Oxford, which existed only till 1690.\r\nAbout 1658 the members were dispersed, the majority coming to London\r\nand attending lectures at Gresham College. Thus, in the midst of civil\r\nwar, thoughtful and inquiring minds found a refuge from the quarrels\r\nof politicians and the babel of contending parties in the pursuit\r\nof knowledge and the advancement of research. The Royal Society was\r\norganized in 1660, and on 22nd April, 1662, Charles II. constituted it\r\na body politic and corporate. The _Philosophical Transactions_ began\r\n6th March, 1664-5. 1668 Newton invented his reflecting telescope,\r\nand on 28th April, 1686, presented to the Society the MS. of his\r\n_Principia_, which the council ordered to be printed.\r\n\r\nRENE DESCARTES (1596-1650), the philosopher, applied himself to the\r\nstudy of physics in all its branches, but especially to physiology. He\r\nsaid that science may be compared to a tree; metaphysics is the root,\r\nphysics is the trunk, and the three chief branches are mechanics,\r\nmedicine, and morals,—the three applications of our knowledge to the\r\noutward world, to the human body, and to the conduct of life.[876] He\r\nstudied chemistry and anatomy, dissecting the heads of animals in order\r\nto explain imagination and memory, which he believed to be physical\r\nprocesses.[877] In 1629 he asks Mersenne to take care of himself, “till\r\nI find out if there is any means of getting a medical theory based\r\non infallible demonstration, which is what I am now inquiring.”[878]\r\nDescartes embraced the doctrine of the circulation of the blood as\r\ndiscovered by Harvey, and he did much to popularise it, falling in\r\nas it did with his mechanical theory of life. He thought the nerves\r\nwere tubular vessels which conduct the animal spirits to the muscles,\r\nand in their turn convey the impressions of the organs to the brain.\r\nHe considered man and the animals were machines. “The animals act\r\nnaturally and by springs, like a watch.”[879] “The greatest of all\r\nthe prejudices we have retained from our infancy is that of believing\r\nthat the beasts think.”[880] Naturally such a monstrous theory did much\r\nto encourage vivisection, a practice common with Descartes.[881] “The\r\nrecluses of Port Royal,” says Dr. Wallace,[882] “seized it eagerly,\r\ndiscussed automatism, dissected living animals in order to show to\r\na morbid curiosity the circulation of the blood, were careless of\r\nthe cries of tortured dogs, and finally embalmed the doctrine in a\r\nsyllogism of their logic: no matter thinks; every soul of beast is\r\nmatter, therefore no soul of beast thinks. He held that the seat of the\r\nmind of man was in that structure of the brain called by anatomists the\r\npineal gland.”\r\n\r\nMALEBRANCHE (1638-1715) was a disciple of Descartes, who thought his\r\nsystem served to explain the mystery of life and thought. In his\r\nfamous _Recherche de la Verite_ he anticipated later discoveries in\r\nphysiology, _e.g._, Hartley’s principle of the interdependence of\r\nvibrations in the nervous system and our conscious states.\r\n\r\nBLAISE PASCAL (1623-1662), as a natural philosopher, rendered great\r\nservices to science. The account of his experiments, written in 1662,\r\non the equilibrium of fluids, entitles him to be considered one of the\r\nfounders of hydrodynamics. His experiments on the pressure of the air\r\nand his invention for measuring it greatly assisted to advance the work\r\nbegun by Galileo and Torricelli. Not only in the great work done, but\r\nin those which were undertaken in consequence of his inspiration, we\r\nrecognise in Pascal one of the most brilliant scientists of a brilliant\r\nage.\r\n\r\nHOBBES (1588-1679), the famous author of the _Leviathan_, endeavoured\r\nto base all that he could upon mathematical principles. Philosophy, he\r\nsaid, is concerned with the perfect knowledge of truth in all matters\r\nwhatsoever. If the moral philosophers had done for mankind what the\r\ngeometricians had effected, men would have enjoyed an immortal peace.\r\n\r\nBENEDICT DE SPINOZA (1632-1677), the philosopher, had some medical\r\ntraining. His spirit has had a large share in moulding the philosophic\r\nthought of the nineteenth century. Novalis saw in him not an atheist,\r\nbut a “God-intoxicated man.” His philosophy indeed was a pure\r\npantheism; the foundation of his system is the doctrine of one infinite\r\nsubstance. All finite things are modes of this substance.\r\n\r\nSIR ISAAC NEWTON (1642-1727), the greatest of natural philosophers,\r\nin the years 1685 and 1686—years for ever to be remembered in the\r\nhistory of science—composed almost the whole of his famous work, the\r\n_Principia_.\r\n\r\nROBERT BOYLE (1626-1691), one of the great nature philosophers of the\r\nseventeenth century, and one of the founders of the Royal Society,\r\npublished his first book at Oxford, in 1660, entitled _New Experiments,\r\nPhysico-Mechanical, touching the Spring of Air, and its Effects_.\r\nHe was at one time deeply interested in alchemy. He was the first\r\ngreat investigator who carried out the suggestions of Bacon’s _Novum\r\nOrganon_. He was a patient researcher and observer of facts.\r\n\r\nPIERRE BAYLE (1647-1706), the author of the celebrated _Historical\r\nand Critical Dictionary_, was a sceptic, of a peculiar turn of mind.\r\nHe knew so much concerning every side of every subject which he\r\nhad considered, that he came to the conclusion that certainty was\r\nunattainable.\r\n\r\nVAN HELMONT (1578-1644) was one of the most celebrated followers of\r\nParacelsus. He learned astronomy, astrology, and philosophy at Rouvain,\r\nthen studied magic under the Jesuits, and afterwards learned law,\r\nbotany, and medicine; but he became disgusted with the pretensions of\r\nthe latter science when it failed to cure him of the itch. He became\r\na mystic, and attached himself to the principles of Tauler and Thomas\r\nà Kempis. Then he practised medicine as an act of charity, till,\r\nfalling in with the works of Paracelsus, he devoted ten years to their\r\nstudy. He married, and devoted himself to medicine and chemistry,\r\ninvestigating the composition of the water of mineral springs. Few\r\nmen have ever formed a nobler conception of the true physician\r\nthan Van Helmont, or more earnestly endeavoured to live up to it.\r\nNotwithstanding his mysticism, science owes much to this philosopher,\r\nfor he was an acute chemist. We owe to him the first application of the\r\nterm “gas,” in the sense in which it is used at present. He discovered\r\nthat gas is disengaged when heat is applied to various bodies, and when\r\nacids act upon metals and their carbonates. He discovered carbonic\r\nacid. He believed in the existence of an Archeus in man and animals,\r\nwhich is somewhat like the soul of man after the Fall; it resides\r\nin the stomach as creative thought, in the spleen as appetite. This\r\nArcheus is a ferment, and is the generative principle and basis\r\nof life. Disease is due to the Fall of Man. The Archeus influus\r\ncauses general diseases; the Archei insiti, local diseases: dropsy,\r\nfor example, is due to an obstruction of the passage of the kidney\r\nsecretion by the enraged Archeus. Van Helmont gave wine in fevers,\r\nabhorred bleeding, and advocated the use of simple chemical medicines.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS DE LA BOË (Sylvius), (1614-1672) was a physician who founded\r\nthe Medico-Chemical Sect amongst doctors. Health and disease he held to\r\nbe due to the relations of the fluids of the body and their neutrality,\r\ndiseases being caused by their acidity or alkalinity.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS GOULSTON, M.D. (died 1632), was a distinguished London\r\nphysician, who was not less famous for his classic learning and\r\ntheology than for the practice of his profession. He founded what are\r\nknown as the Goulstonian lectures, which are delivered by one of the\r\nfour youngest doctors of the Royal College of Physicians, London. “A\r\ndead body was, if possible, to be procured, and two or more diseases\r\ntreated of.”\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WINSTON, M.D. (born 1575), was professor of physic in Gresham\r\nCollege. His lectures included “an entire body of anatomy,” and were\r\nconsidered, when published, as the most complete and accurate then\r\nextant in English.\r\n\r\nThe Anatomy Lecture at Oxford was first proposed to the University on\r\nNov. 17th, 1623, with an endowment of £25 a year stipend. Out of this\r\nthe reader had “to pay yearly to a skilful Chirurgeon or Dissector of\r\nthe body, to be named by the said reader, the sums of and £3 and £2\r\nmore by the year towards the ordering and burying of the body.”[883]\r\nDr. Clayton, the King’s Professor of Physic, was the first reader, and\r\nthe first chirurgeon was Bernard Wright.[884]\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI ALFONSO BORELLI (1608-1679), the founder of the Mathematical\r\nSchool of Medicine, which attempted to subject to calculation the\r\nphenomena of the living economy, was professor of medicine at Florence.\r\nHe restricted the application of his system chiefly to muscular\r\nmotions, or to those which are evidently of a mechanical character.\r\nPhysiology is exceedingly indebted to this school for many valuable\r\nsuggestions, and Boerhaave distinctly acknowledged them in his\r\n_Institutions_.[885]\r\n\r\nGEORGE JOYLIFFE, M.D. (died 1658), was partly concerned in the\r\ndiscovery of the lymphatics. It is not possible to say precisely to\r\nwhom the discovery of the lymphatics was due; they seem to have been\r\nobserved independently about the year 1651 to 1652 by Rudbeck a Swede,\r\nby Bartholine a Dane, and by Joyliffe.[886]\r\n\r\nA new era in medicine was inaugurated by THOMAS SYDENHAM, M.D.\r\n(1624-1689), “the British Hippocrates,” whose only standard was\r\nobservation and experience, and whose faith in the healing power\r\nof nature was unlimited. He studied at Oxford, but he graduated at\r\nCambridge. He was the friend of Locke and of Robert Boyle. He was\r\nlooked upon by the faculty with disfavour as an innovator, because,\r\nin his own words to Boyle, he endeavoured to reduce practice to a\r\ngreater easiness and plainness. His fame as the father of English\r\nmedicine was posthumous. It was indeed acknowledged in his lifetime\r\nthat he rendered good service to medicine by his “expectant” treatment\r\nof small-pox, by his invention of his laudanum (the first form of a\r\ntincture of opium such as we have it), and for his advocacy of the\r\nuse of Peruvian bark in agues. Yet his professional brethren were\r\ninclined to look upon him as a sectary, and considerable opposition\r\nwas manifested towards him. Arbuthnot, in 1727, styled him “Æmulus\r\nHippocrates.” Boerhaave referred to him as “Angliæ lumen, artis Phœbum,\r\nveram Hippocratici viri speciem.” He did the best he could to cure\r\nhis patients without mystery and resort to the traditional and often\r\nridiculous dogmas of the medical craft. Many good stories are extant\r\nwhich illustrate this fact. He was once called to prescribe for a\r\ngentleman who had been subjected to the lowering treatment so much\r\nin vogue in those days. He found him pitifully depressed. Sydenham\r\n“conceived that this was occasioned partly by his long illness, partly\r\nby the previous evacuations, and partly by emptiness. I therefore\r\nordered him a roast chicken and a pint of canary.” When Blackmore first\r\nengaged in the study of medicine, he asked Dr. Sydenham what authors he\r\nshould read, and was told to study DON QUIXOTE, “which,” he said, “is a\r\nvery good book; I read it still.” He used to say that there were cases\r\nin his practice where “I have consulted my patients’ safety and my own\r\nreputation most effectually by doing nothing at all.”\r\n\r\nSydenham, having long attended a rich man for an illness which had\r\narisen and was kept going chiefly by his own indolence and luxurious\r\nhabits, at last told him that he could do no more for him, but that\r\nthere lived at Inverness a certain physician, named Robinson, who would\r\ndoubtless be able to cure him. Provided with a letter of introduction\r\nand a complete history of the “case,” the invalid set out on the long\r\njourney to Inverness. Arrived at his destination, full of hope and\r\neager expectation of a cure, he inquired diligently for Dr. Robinson,\r\nonly to learn that there was no such doctor there, neither had there\r\nbeen in the memory of the oldest inhabitant. The gentleman returned to\r\nLondon full of indignation against Sydenham, whom he violently rated\r\nfor sending him so far on a fool’s errand. “But,” exclaimed Sydenham,\r\n“you are in much better health!” “Yes,” replied the patient, “I am now\r\nwell enough, but no thanks to you.” “No,” answered Sydenham; “it was\r\nDr. Robinson who cured you. I wished to send you a journey with some\r\nobject and interest in view; in going, you had Dr. Robinson and his\r\nwonderful cures in contemplation; and in returning, you were equally\r\nengaged in thinking of scolding me.”\r\n\r\nThe Civil War, which violently upset the speculations and research at\r\nOxford, when, as Antony Wood says, the University was “empty as to\r\nscholars, but pretty well replenished with Parliamentary soldiers,”\r\nafforded just that stimulus to thought and that upheaval of dogma and\r\nprejudice which were eminently favourable to the advance of medical\r\nscience. Men had learned to treat old doctrines with little respect for\r\ntheir mere antiquity; authority was discredited, it was subjected to\r\ntest, observation and criticism; men no longer believed those doctrines\r\nabout God and His counsels which the Fathers and the Church taught them\r\nabout religion, much less were they inclined to bow to Aristotle and\r\nGalen when they dictated to them on medicine. Anciently, when bitten\r\nby a mad dog, it was enough for them to believe with the fathers of\r\nmedicine that it was sufficient for the patient to hold some herb\r\ndittany in the left hand, while he scratched his back with the other\r\nto ensure his future safety. Men took to thinking for themselves; the\r\nspirit of investigation was aroused; men’s minds, in every condition\r\nof society, in every town and village, were aroused to activity. There\r\nprobably never was a time when there was more activity of thought in\r\nOxford than at this period. The stimulus of collision evoked many\r\nsparks of genius, and the Civil War produced at our Universities\r\nwholesome disturbance, not destruction of any good things. Sydenham,\r\ntherefore, was distinctly the product of his age. He does not seem\r\nto have been a very learned man, neither, on the other hand, was he\r\nwholly untaught. There are not many evidences in his works of very\r\nwide reading of medical literature, though he was a sincere admirer\r\nof Hippocrates, evidently from a sound acquaintance with his works.\r\nSydenham’s first medical work was published in 1666. It consisted of\r\naccounts of continued fevers, symptoms of the same, of intermittent\r\nfevers and small-pox, and was entitled _Methodus Curandi Febres,\r\nPropriis observationibus superstructa_. In it the author maintains that\r\n“a fever is Nature’s engine which she brings into the field to remove\r\nher enemy, or her handmaid, either for evacuating the impurities of\r\nthe blood, or for reducing it into a _new state_. Secondly, that the\r\ntrue and genuine cure of this sickness consists in such a tempering\r\nof the commotion of the blood, that it may neither exceed nor be too\r\nlanguid.”[887]\r\n\r\nIt was about this period that Peruvian bark was first introduced into\r\nEuropean medicine. Perhaps no other drug has ever been so widely\r\nand deservedly used as this American remedy for fevers, agues, and\r\ndebility. The earliest authenticated account of the use of Cinchona\r\nbark in medicine is found in 1638, when the Countess of Cinchon, the\r\nwife of the Governor of Peru, was cured of fever by its administration.\r\nThe Jesuit missionaries are said to have sent accounts of its virtues\r\nto Europe, in consequence of one of their brethren having been cured of\r\nfever by taking it at the suggestion of a South American Indian.\r\n\r\nThe University of Montpellier, at the time of our great Civil War, was\r\nmuch derided by the Paris Faculty for its laxity in granting degrees\r\nin medicine. The enemies of Montpellier said that a three-months’\r\nresidence, and the keeping of an act and opponency, sufficed to make a\r\nman a Bachelor of Medicine. The professors were accused of neglecting\r\ntheir lectures and selling their degrees; but, worse than all, it was\r\nalleged that blood-letting and purging had fallen into disuse, and that\r\nthe Montpellier treatment was “more expectant than heroic, and more\r\ntonic than evacuant.”[888] Friendly historians, on the other hand, say\r\nthat at this period the medicinal uses of calomel and antimony were\r\nbetter taught there than elsewhere; that museums, libraries, and good\r\nclinical teaching flourished, so as to afford the student excellent\r\nmeans of acquiring a sound knowledge of his profession.[889]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HARVEY, M.D., the famous discoverer of the circulation of the\r\nblood, and the greatest physiologist the world has ever seen, was born\r\nat Folkestone, 1578. He entered Caius College, Cambridge, 1593. Having\r\ntaken his degree, he travelled through France and Germany, and then\r\nvisited Padua, the most celebrated school of medicine of that time.\r\nFabricius ab Aquâpendente was then professor of anatomy, Minadous\r\nprofessor of medicine, and Casserius professor of surgery. In 1615\r\nHarvey was appointed Lumleian lecturer, and he commenced his course of\r\nlectures in the following year—the year of Shakespeare’s death.\r\n\r\nIn this course he is supposed to have expounded his views on the\r\ncirculation of the blood, which rendered his name immortal. His\r\ncelebrated work, _Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis_,\r\nwas published in 1628; but he says in that work that for more than nine\r\nyears he had confirmed and illustrated his opinion in his lectures, by\r\narguments which were founded on ocular demonstration. He was appointed\r\nphysician extraordinary to James I. in 1618. He was in attendance\r\non King Charles I. at the battle of Edgehill. The king had been an\r\nenlightened patron of Harvey’s researches, and had placed the royal\r\ndeer parks at Hampton Court and Windsor at his disposal. In 1651\r\nHarvey’s _Exercitationes de Generatione_ was published.\r\n\r\nARISTOTLE knew but little of the vessels of the body, yet he traced the\r\norigin of all the veins to the heart, and he seems to have been aware\r\nof the distinction between veins and arteries. “Every artery,” he says,\r\n“is accompanied by a vein; the former are filled only with breath or\r\nair.”[890]\r\n\r\nAristotle thought that the windpipe conveys air into the heart.\r\nAlthough _Galen_ understood the muscles very well, he knew little\r\nof the vessels. The liver he held to be the origin of the veins, and\r\nthe heart of the arteries. He knew, however, of their junctions or\r\nanastomoses.[891]\r\n\r\nMONDINO, the anatomist of Bologna, who dissected and taught in 1315,\r\nhad some idea of the circulation of the blood, for he says that the\r\nheart transmits blood to the lungs.[892] The great Italian anatomists,\r\ndiligent students as they were of the human frame, all missed the\r\ngreat discovery. SERVETUS, who was burnt by Calvin as a heretic in\r\nGeneva in 1553, is the first person who distinctly describes the small\r\ncirculation, or that which carries the blood from the heart to the\r\nlungs and back again to the heart. He says:[893] “The communication\r\nbetween the right and left ventricles of the heart is made, not as\r\nis commonly believed, through the partition of the heart, but by a\r\nremarkable artifice the blood is carried from the right ventricle\r\nby a long circuit through the lungs; is elaborated by the lungs,\r\nmade yellow, and transferred from the _vena arteriosa_ into the\r\n_arteria venosa_.” Still, his theories are full of fancies about a\r\n“_vital spirit_, which has its origin in the left ventricle,” and\r\nare accordingly unscientific to that extent. Servetus was, however,\r\ncertainly the true predecessor of Harvey in physiology; this is\r\nuniversally admitted.[894]\r\n\r\nREALDUS COLUMBUS[895] is thought by some writers to have had a still\r\ngreater share than Servetus in the discovery of the circulation. He\r\ndenies the muscularity of the heart, yet correctly teaches that the\r\nblood passes from the right to the left ventricle, not through the\r\npartition in the heart but through the lungs. Harvey quotes Columbus,\r\nbut does not refer to Servetus. It must be remembered that when the\r\nunfortunate Servetus was burnt at the stake, his work was destroyed\r\nwith him, and only two copies are known to have escaped the flames.[896]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the valves of the veins by SYLVIUS and FABRICIUS[897]\r\nundoubtedly was the chief factor in the preparation for Harvey’s\r\ndiscovery of the circulation. It was he who first appreciated\r\ntheir significance, and grasped the full meaning of the pulmonary\r\ncirculation. CÆSALPINUS, in his _Quæstiones Peripateticæ_ (1571), is\r\nanother claimant for the honours due to Harvey; he had certain confused\r\nideas of the general circulation, and he made some experiments which\r\nenabled him to understand the pulmonary circulation, but he certainly\r\ndid not know the circulation of the blood as a whole; he knew no more\r\nof it, in fact, than he gathered from Galen and Servetus.[898]\r\n\r\nEven Harvey, splendid as was the work he did, could not entirely\r\ndemonstrate the complete circulation of the blood. He was not able\r\nto discover the capillary vessels by which the blood passes from the\r\narteries to the veins. This, the only missing point, was reserved for\r\nMALPIGHI to discover. In 1661 this celebrated anatomist saw in the\r\nlungs of a frog, by the aid of the newly invented microscope, the blood\r\npassing from one set of vessels to the other.\r\n\r\nHarvey began his investigations by dissecting a great number of living\r\nanimals. He examined in this way dogs, pigs, serpents, frogs, and\r\nfishes. He did not disdain to learn even from slugs, oysters, lobsters,\r\nand insects, and the chick itself while still in the shell. He observed\r\nand experimented upon the ventricles, the auricles, the arteries,\r\nand the veins. He learned precisely the object of the valves of the\r\nveins—to favour the flow of the blood towards the heart; and it was to\r\nthis latter observation, and not the vivisection, that he attributed\r\nhis splendid discovery.\r\n\r\n“I remember,” says Boyle, “that when I asked our famous Harvey what\r\nwere the things that induced him to think of a circulation of the\r\nblood, he answered me, that when he took notice that the valves in the\r\nveins of so many parts of the body were so placed, that they gave a\r\nfree passage to the blood towards the heart, but opposed the passage\r\nof the venal blood the contrary way, he was incited to imagine that\r\nso provident a cause as Nature had not placed so many valves without\r\ndesign; and no design seemed more probable than that the blood should\r\nbe sent through the arteries, and return through the veins, whose\r\nvalves did not oppose its cause that way.” What clear views of the\r\nmotions and pressure of a fluid circulating in ramifying tubes must\r\nhave been held by Harvey to enable him to deduce his discovery from a\r\ncontemplation of the simple valves! It was observation, experience,\r\nwhich led him to this. “In every science,” he says,[899] “be it what\r\nit will, a diligent observation is requisite, and sense itself must be\r\nfrequently consulted. We must not rely upon other men’s experience,\r\nbut our own, without which no man is a proper disciple of any part of\r\nnatural knowledge.”\r\n\r\nDr. J. H. Bridges, of the Local Government Board, delivered the\r\nHarveian oration on October 20th, 1892, at the Royal College of\r\nPhysicians. Dr. Bridges said: “In his discovery William Harvey\r\nemployed every method of biological research, direct observation,\r\nexperiment, above all the great Aristotelian method of comparison to\r\nwhich he himself attributes his success. His manuscript notes show how\r\nfreely he used it. They show that he had dissected no less than eighty\r\nspecies of animals. It is sometimes said that experimentation on living\r\nanimals was the principal process of discovery. This I believe to be an\r\nexaggerated view, though such experiments were effective in convincing\r\nothers of the discovery when made. It need not be said that no ethical\r\nproblem connected with this matter was recognised in Harvey’s time.\r\nThe first to recognise such a problem was that great and successful\r\nexperimenter, deep thinker, and humane man, Sir Charles Bell. What\r\nwere the effects of Harvey’s discovery? It was assuredly the most\r\nmomentous event in medical history since the time of Galen. It was the\r\nfirst attempt to show that the processes of the human body followed or\r\naccompanied each other by laws as certain and precise as those which\r\nKepler and Galileo were revealing in the solar system or on the earth’s\r\nsurface. Henceforth it became clear that all laws of force and energy\r\nthat operated in the inorganic world were applicable to the human body.”\r\n\r\nThe case for Harvey’s originality is well put by the author of the\r\narticle on Harvey in the _Dictionary of National Biography_. “The\r\nmodern controversy as to whether the discovery was taken from some\r\nprevious author is sufficiently refuted by the opinion of the opponents\r\nof his views in his own time, who agreed in denouncing the doctrine\r\nas new; by the laborious method of gradual demonstration obvious in\r\nhis book and lectures; and lastly, by the complete absence of lucid\r\ndemonstration of the action of the heart and course of the blood\r\nin Cæsalpinus, Servetus, and all others who have been suggested as\r\npossible originals of the discovery. It remains to this day the\r\ngreatest of the discoveries of physiology, and its whole honour belongs\r\nto Harvey.”\r\n\r\n“That there is one blood stream, common to both arteries and veins,\r\nthat the blood poured into the right auricle passes into the right\r\nventricle, that it is from there forced by the contraction of the\r\nventricular walls along the pulmonary artery through the lungs and\r\npulmonary veins to the left auricle, that it then passes into the\r\nleft ventricle to be distributed through the aorta to every part of\r\nthe animal body; and that the heart is the great propeller of this\r\nperpetual motion, as in a circle. This is the great truth of the\r\nmotion of the heart and blood, commonly called the circulation, and\r\nmust for ever remain the glorious legacy of William Harvey to rational\r\nphysiology and medicine in every land.”[900]\r\n\r\nHarvey explains how he was led to his great discovery: “When I first\r\ngave my mind to vivisections as a means of discovering the motions and\r\nuses of the heart, and sought to discover these from actual inspection,\r\nand not from the writings of others, I found the task so truly arduous,\r\nso full of difficulties, that I was almost tempted to think with\r\nFrascatorius, that the motion of the heart was only to be comprehended\r\nby God. For I could neither rightly perceive at first when the systole\r\nand when the diastole took place, nor when and where dilatation and\r\ncontraction occurred, by reason of the rapidity of the motion, which\r\nin many animals is accomplished in the twinkling of an eye, coming and\r\ngoing like a flash of lightning; so that the systole presented itself\r\nto me now from this point, now from that; the diastole the same; and\r\nthen everything was reversed, the motions occurring, as it seemed,\r\nvariously and confusedly together. My mind was therefore greatly\r\nunsettled, nor did I know what I should myself conclude, nor what\r\nbelieve from others. I was not surprised that Andreas Laurentius should\r\nhave written that the motion of the heart was as perplexing as the flux\r\nand reflux of Euripus had appeared to Aristotle. At length, and by\r\nusing greater diligence and investigation, making frequent inspection\r\nof many and various animals, and collating numerous observations, I\r\nthought that I had attained to the truth, that I should extricate\r\nmyself and escape from this labyrinth, and that I had discovered\r\nwhat I so much desired, both the motion and the use of the heart and\r\narteries.”[901]\r\n\r\nJOHN LOCKE (1632-1704). The great philosopher was a thoroughly educated\r\nphysician engaged in the practice of medicine. He was the friend of\r\nSydenham, whose principles he defended and whose works are doubtless\r\npermeated with the thoughts of the author of the famous treatise on the\r\nHuman Understanding. In a letter of Locke’s to W. Molyneux he says:\r\n“You cannot imagine how far a little observation carefully made by\r\na man not tied up to the four humours [Galen], or sal, sulphur, and\r\nmercury [Paracelsus], or to acid and alkali [Sylvius and Willis], which\r\nhas of late prevailed, will carry a man in the curing of diseases,\r\nthough very stubborn and dangerous; and that with very little and\r\ncommon things, and almost no medicine at all.” Locke declared that\r\nwe have no innate ideas, but that all our knowledge is derived from\r\nexperience. The acquirement of knowledge is due to the investigation of\r\nthings by the bodily senses.\r\n\r\nSurgery about this period began to flourish in England. RICHARD\r\nWISEMAN (1625-1686), the “Father of English Surgery,” was in the royal\r\nservice from Charles I. to James II. His military experience greatly\r\nassisted him in his profession. He treated aneurism by compression,\r\npractised “flap-amputation,” and laid down rules for operating for\r\nhernia.\r\n\r\nJAMES PRIMROSE, M.D. (died 1659), was a voluminous writer who opposed\r\nthe teaching of Harvey on the circulation of the blood.\r\n\r\nBALDWIN HAMEY, jun., M.D., was the most munificent of all the\r\nbenefactors of the London College of Physicians. He was lecturer on\r\nAnatomy at the College in 1647, and a voluminous writer, though he\r\npublished little or nothing.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS GLISSON, M.D. (died 1677), was one of the first of the group\r\nof anatomists in England who, incited by Harvey’s example, devoted\r\nthemselves to enthusiastic research. His account of the cellular\r\nenvelope of the portal vein in his work _De Hepate_, published in 1654,\r\nhas immortalised his name in the designation “Glisson’s capsule.” He\r\nwrote a work on rickets, _De Rachitide seu Morbo Puerili_. Glisson\r\nascribed to the lymphatic vessels the function of absorption.\r\n\r\nJONATHAN GODDARD, M.D. (died 1674), frequented the meetings which gave\r\nbirth to the Royal Society. He was a good chemist, and invented the\r\nfamous volatile drops known on the Continent as the Guttæ Anglicanæ. He\r\nmade the first telescope ever constructed in this country.\r\n\r\nDANIEL WHISTLER, M.D. (died 1684), wrote an essay on “The Rickets,”\r\nwhich is the earliest printed account we have of that disease.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WHARTON, M.D. (died 1673), was a very distinguished anatomist,\r\nwho remained in London during the whole of the plague of 1666. He was\r\nthe author of the most accurate work on the glands of the body and\r\ntheir diseases which up to that time had appeared.\r\n\r\nRAYMOND VIEUSSENS in 1684 published a great work on the anatomy of the\r\nbrain, spinal cord, and nerves. He investigated the sympathetic nerve\r\nand the structure of the heart.\r\n\r\nLEEUWENHOECK (1632-1723) discovered the corpuscles in the blood and the\r\nspermatozoa.\r\n\r\nMARCELLO MALPIGHI (1628-1694), by his microscopical researches, first\r\nexplained the organization of the lung and the terminations of the\r\nbronchial tubes. He traced the termination of the arteries in the\r\nveins, and thus completed the discovery of the circulation of the\r\nblood; by his researches in the deeper layer of the cuticle, and\r\ncertain bodies in the spleen and kidney, he has given his name to these\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the MICROSCOPE in 1621 was of the utmost importance to\r\nthe study of minute anatomy and physiology.\r\n\r\nPIERRE DIONIS (died 1718), a famous French surgeon, published a work on\r\nthe anatomy of man, which was translated into Chinese at the emperor’s\r\nrequest. He also wrote on rickets in relation to the pelvis, and\r\nadvanced the study of dentistry. He explained the circulation, and\r\nwrote a monograph on catalepsy.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BARTHOLIN (1619-1680), professor of anatomy at Copenhagen, made\r\nimportant investigations on the lacteals and lymphatic vessels.\r\n\r\nCASPAR ASSELLIUS (1581-1626) discovered the chyliferous vessels in the\r\ndog; FABRICE DE PEIRESC (1580-1637), dissecting a criminal two hours\r\nafter execution, discovered them in man; VAN HORNE (1621-1670), in\r\n1652, first demonstrated the vessels in man. (It has, however, been\r\nclaimed that George Jolyffe discovered the lymphatics in 1650.)\r\n\r\nJEAN PECQUET (1622-1674), a French physician, published, in 1651, his\r\n_New Anatomical Experiments_, in which he made known his discovery\r\nof the receptacle of the chyle, till then unknown, and described the\r\nvessel which conveys the chyle to the subclavian vein.\r\n\r\nOLAUS RUDBECK (1630-1702), a Swedish surgeon, shares with Jolyffe the\r\nhonour of the discovery of the termination of the lymphatic vessels. He\r\ndemonstrated them in the presence of Queen Christina, and traced them\r\nto the thoracic duct, and the latter to the subclavian vein.\r\n\r\nGERARD BLAES (died 1662) made numerous discoveries in connection with\r\nthe glands.\r\n\r\nANTONY NUCK (1650-1692) first injected the lymphatics with quicksilver,\r\nrectified various errors in the work of his predecessors, and by his\r\nown researches did much to complete the anatomy of the glands.\r\n\r\nPAUL SARPI (1552-1623), of Venice, was a monk of whom La Courayer\r\nsaid, “Qu’il était Catholique en gros et quelque fois Protestant en\r\ndétail.” He was the friend of Galileo, and, though he did not invent\r\nthe telescope, was the first who made an accurate map of the moon.\r\nIt is not true that he anticipated Harvey in his discovery of the\r\ncirculation, though he was a great physiologist, and discovered the\r\ncontractility of the iris.\r\n\r\nNATHANAEL HIGHMORE (1613-1685) was a physician and anatomist who is\r\nchiefly remembered for his description of the cavity in the superior\r\nmaxillary bone which bears his name. It had, however, been previously\r\ndescribed by Cassørius. He demonstrated the difference between the\r\nlacteals and the mesenteric veins.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WIRSUNG (died 1643) was a prosector to Vesalius. He discovered\r\nthe excretory duct of the pancreas.\r\n\r\nSIR CHRISTOPHER WREN (1632-1723) was the first to suggest the injection\r\nof medicines into the veins.\r\n\r\nTHORBERN, a Danish peasant, about this time invented an instrument for\r\namputating the elongated uvula.\r\n\r\nJAN SWAMMERDAM (1637-1686) was the first to prove that the queen bee\r\nwas a female.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS MILLINGTON (_circ._ 1676) pointed out the sexual organs of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nFELIX VICQ D’AZYR (1748-1794) was one of the zoologists whose\r\nresearches exercised an important influence on the progress of anatomy.\r\nHe investigated the origin of the brain and nerves, and the comparative\r\nanatomy of the vocal organs.\r\n\r\nSIR THOMAS BROWNE, M.D., of Norwich (1605-1682), the author of the\r\nimmortal _Religio Medici_, studied medicine at Montpellier, Padua, and\r\nLeyden. He was a man who, in his own words, _could not do nothing_.\r\nThough he wrote a famous work on _Vulgar Errors_, he could not rise\r\nsuperior to the commonest one of his time—the belief in witchcraft.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WILLIS, M.D. (1621-1675), was celebrated for his researches in\r\nthe anatomy and pathology of the brain. Unfortunately he neglected\r\nobservation for theorising.\r\n\r\nDr. Freind said of Willis that he was the first inventor of the nervous\r\nsystem. Willis taught that the cerebrum is the seat of the intellectual\r\nfaculties, and the source from which spring the voluntary motions. He\r\nconsigned the involuntary motions to the cerebellum; these go on in a\r\nregular manner, without our knowledge and independently of our will. He\r\nsupposed that the nerves of voluntary motions arise chiefly from the\r\ncerebrum, and those of the involuntary motions from the cerebellum or\r\nits appendages.[902]\r\n\r\nWillis deserves to be gratefully remembered in medical history as the\r\ngreat reformer of pharmacology. Having been led to consider how it is\r\nthat medicines act on the various organs of the body, he reflected that\r\nthere was usually very little relationship between the means of cure\r\nand the physiological and pathological processes to be influenced.\r\nMedicines were given at random. Mineral poisons, such as antimony, were\r\nrecklessly prescribed, to the destruction, not of the disease only, but\r\ntoo frequently of the patient also. “So heedlessly,” says Willis, “are\r\nthese executioners in the habit of sporting with the human body, while\r\nthey are led to prepare and administer these dangerous medicines, not\r\nby any deliberation, nor by the guidance of any method, but by mere\r\nhazard and blind impulse.”[903]\r\n\r\nThe object of Willis was to establish a direct and reasonable\r\nrelationship between the physiological and morbid conditions of the\r\nbody on the one hand, and the indications for cure and the therapeutic\r\nmeans by which these were to be brought about on the other.[904] It was\r\na great task, and Willis did not wholly succeed; but his method was\r\nthe right one, however grievously he failed to carry it into practice,\r\nfor he prescribed blood, the human skull, salt of vipers, water of\r\nsnails and earthworms, millipeds, and other things which he ought to\r\nhave known could have no effect on any disease.[905] We must not be too\r\nseverely critical, for Willis was the first to attempt the reformation\r\nof this degraded state of Materia Medica.\r\n\r\nThe state of Materia Medica (or the drugs and chemicals used by the\r\nphysician) during the end of the seventeenth and the earlier part of\r\nthe eighteenth century, was remarkable, says Dr. Thomson,[906] for four\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n_First_, there was a great number of remedies strongly recommended for\r\nthe cure of diseases; but many of them were inert and useless, and thus\r\nthe practitioner was perplexed and confused.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, the popular confidence in all these medicines was\r\nirrational and extreme.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, it was the custom to combine in one prescription a great\r\nnumber of ingredients. The Pharmacopœias of the period contain formulæ\r\nwhich embraced in some instances from twenty-four up to as many as\r\nfifty-two ingredients. Sydenham is the first who exhibits any tendency\r\nto greater simplicity in his prescriptions.\r\n\r\n_Lastly_, there was no rational or logical connection between the\r\ndisease to be cured and the remedy with which it was treated.\r\nEmpiricism and superstition to a serious extent dominated medicine, and\r\nretarded its progress.\r\n\r\nYet, even during the seventeenth century, original thinkers and men\r\nof genius connected with one or other of the universities, struck\r\nout a path for themselves which led to brighter things. First was\r\nHarvey, then came Wharton, Glisson, Willis, Lower, Mayow, Grew,\r\nCharleton, Collins, Sydenham, Morton, Bennet, and Ridley; all these\r\nmen were students of anatomy and ardent investigators in the field of\r\nphysiology. It is true that it was long before the labours of these\r\npioneers of scientific medicine resulted in any marked improvement in\r\nthe actual method of treating disease; it is no less certain that our\r\nmethods of to-day are based upon the labours of the great scientific\r\ninvestigators of the age we are considering.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL COLLINS, M.D. (died 1710), was celebrated as an accomplished\r\ncomparative anatomist, whose work was much praised by Boerhaave and\r\nHaller.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CROONE, M.D. (died 1684), was one of the original Fellows of\r\nthe Royal Society. In 1670 he was appointed lecturer on anatomy at\r\nSurgeons’ Hall. He is gratefully remembered as the founder of what is\r\nnow called the “Croonian Lecture.”\r\n\r\nRICHARD LOWER, M.D. (1631-1691), was an anatomist and physiologist,\r\nwho assisted Willis in his researches, and who wrote a treatise on\r\ntransfusion of blood, which he practised at Oxford in 1665, and also\r\nbefore the Royal Society. His name is kept in remembrance by anatomists\r\nby its association with the study of the heart in the structure known\r\nas the “tuberculum Lowerii.”\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to mention FRÈRE JACQUES, who went to Paris in 1697;\r\nhe was a Franciscan monk, who was a famous operator for the stone.\r\nOriginally a day labourer, he became so expert a lithotomist that he\r\nis said to have cut nearly 5,000 persons in the course of his life. In\r\nthe height of his success he had no knowledge of anatomy, though he\r\nwas afterwards induced to learn it. He is for ever celebrated as the\r\ninventor of the lateral method in lithotomy.[907]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSKATOLOGICAL MEDICINE AND THE REFORM OF PHARMACOLOGY.\r\n\r\n Loathsome Medicines.—Sympathetical Cures.—Weapon-Salve.—Superstitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the splendid scientific work of the period, the\r\nabsurdest superstitions about amulets and charms still held their\r\nground. Sir John Harrington, in his _Schoole of Salerne_, printed in\r\n1624, says: “Alwaies in your hands use eyther Corall or yellow Amber,\r\nor a chalcedonium, or a sweet Pommander, or some like precious stone\r\nto be worne in a ring upon the little finger of the left hand; have\r\nin your rings eyther a Smaragd, a Saphire, or a Draconites, which you\r\nshall beare for an ornament; for in stones, as also in hearbes, there\r\nis great efficacie and vertue, but they are not altogether perceived by\r\nus; hold sometime in your mouth eyther a Hyacinth, or a Crystall, or a\r\nGranat, or pure Gold, or Silver, or else sometimes pure Sugar-candy.\r\nFor _Aristotle_ doth affirme, and so doth Albertus Magnus, that a\r\nSmaragd worne about the necke, is good against the Falling-sicknes; for\r\nsurely the virtue of an hearbe is great, but much more the vertue of a\r\nprecious stone, which is very likely that they are endued with occult\r\nand hidden vertues.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIA MEDICA.\r\n\r\nAmongst those who, after Willis, laboured to reform pharmacology may be\r\nmentioned—\r\n\r\nJOHN ZWELFER, a learned physician of Vienna, who published in 1651 a\r\ngreatly improved Pharmacopœia, which rejected many useless and improper\r\nmedicines.\r\n\r\nDANIEL LUDWIG in 1671 published a dissertation on useless and\r\nunsatisfactory drugs. He denied the virtues of earthworms, toads, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nMOSES CHARAS (1618-1698) was a pharmacist of Paris, who founded the\r\nhistorical establishment known as the _Vipères d’or_ of that city.\r\nSeventeenth-century pharmacy owed much to this man, who was “one\r\nof the last of the Arabian polypharmacists, one of the last of the\r\nadepts of expiring alchemy, and the immediate precursor of the epoch\r\nof Lemery.”[908] He studied pharmacy at Montpellier. He was acquainted\r\nwith natural history.\r\n\r\nNo history of medicine would be complete without reference to the\r\nimmense number of loathsome and filthy substances which from the\r\nremotest times, even up to the present, have been used as medicines.\r\nThis subject has been treated in a very complete form by Captain Bourke\r\nin his work on _Skatological Rites of all Nations_, an important\r\nsection of which is devoted to “Skatological Medicine.”[909] The\r\ntheory underlying the use of disgusting remedies seems to be this:\r\nNearly all medicines which have any efficacy are unpleasant to take;\r\na bitter infusion of tonic leaves or roots is not usually agreeable;\r\nmany good medicines are very nasty, but their efficacy is universally\r\nacknowledged. Ignorant persons argue that the nastiness is the sign of\r\nthe efficacy; that the more disgusting the potion or pill, the more\r\ngood it will do. Even at the present day pauper and hospital patients\r\nof the lower classes have no faith in medicines which are not dark in\r\ncolour and rich in sediment; elegant pharmacy would soon destroy the\r\nbest East-End practice. The most repulsive sediment in a mixture is\r\nreadily swallowed, and is usually considered highly “nourishing.” Now\r\nfrom nasty herbal medicines to filthy animal excretions is but a short\r\nstep. Pliny gives hundreds of instances of skatological remedies in his\r\n_Natural History_, and the ancient writers frequently prescribe them.\r\nThey consist of such things as the dung and urine of various animals,\r\nnot excepting those of man, of the catamenial and lochial discharges,\r\nof the sweat of athletes, of the parasites of human and animal bodies,\r\nof ear wax, human blood, etc.\r\n\r\n“XENOCRATES OF APHRODISIAS (about A.D. 70) introduced disgusting filth\r\nas medicines; _e.g._, ear wax, catamenial fluid, human flesh, bats’\r\nblood, etc.”[910]\r\n\r\n“ASCLEPIADES PHARMACION (about A.D. 100) recommended even animal\r\nexcrement as a medicine.”[911]\r\n\r\nQUINTUS SERENUS SAMONICUS (died A.D. 211) prescribed mouse dung in\r\npoultices; goats’ urine internally for stone in the bladder; earth and\r\ndung from a wagon rut for colic, externally.[912]\r\n\r\nMARCELLUS EMPIRICUS, physician to Theodosius (345-395), prescribed\r\nnatural pills of rabbit’s dung. Dr. Baas declares that this remedy is\r\nin use on the Rhine at the present day, as a cure for consumption.[913]\r\n\r\nCulpeper, in his translation of the Pharmacopœia (1653), ridicules the\r\nremedies enumerated in that work. Thus the College of Physicians employ\r\n“the fat, grease, or suet of a duck, goose, eel, bore, heron, thymallos\r\n(‘_if you know where to get it_,’ says Culpeper), dog, capon, bever,\r\nwild cat, stork, hedgehog, hen, man, lyon, hare, kite, or jack (_if\r\nthey have any fat, I am persuaded ’tis worth twelve pence the grain_),\r\nwolf, mouse of the mountains (_if you can catch them_), pardal, hog,\r\nserpent, badger, bear, fox, vulture (_if you can catch them_), album\r\ngræcum, east and west benzoar, stone taken out a man’s bladder,\r\nviper’s flesh, the brain of hares and sparrows, the rennet of a lamb,\r\nkid, hare, and a calf and a horse too (_quoth the colledg_) [_they\r\nshould have put the rennet of an ass to make medicine for their addle\r\nbrains_], the excrement of a goose, of a dog, of a goat, of pidgeons,\r\nof a stone horse, of swallows, of men, of women, of mice, of peacocks,”\r\netc., etc.\r\n\r\nThere was, says Southey,[914] a water of man’s blood which in Queen\r\nElizabeth’s day was a new invention, “whereof some princes had very\r\ngreat estimation, and used it for to remain thereby in their force,\r\nand, as they thought, to live long.” They chose a strong young man\r\nof twenty-five, dieted him for a month on the best meats, wines and\r\nspices, and at the month’s end they bled him in both arms as much as he\r\ncould “tolerate and abide.” They added a handful of salt to six pounds\r\nof this blood, and distilled it seven times, pouring water upon the\r\nresiduum after every distillation. An ounce of this was to be taken\r\nthree or four times a year. As the life was thought to be in the blood,\r\nit was believed it could thus be transferred.\r\n\r\nDr. O. Möller says that in Denmark, even now in some few places, human\r\nexcrements are not entirely obsolete as epispastic applications in\r\ninflammation of the breast.[915]\r\n\r\nDr. Baas says[916] that urine is taken in the Rhine provinces in fevers\r\ninstead of quinine. This was recommended by the surgical writer Schmidt\r\nin 1649. In the seventeenth century the old pharmacies of Germany\r\ncontained, amongst other disgusting remedies, frog-spawn water, mole’s\r\nblood, oil of spiders, snake’s tongue, mouse dung, spirits of human\r\nbrain, urine of a new-born child, etc.[917] The dung of screech-owls\r\nwas prescribed for melancholy, as also was the dung of doves and calves\r\nboiled in wine, ox-dung, etc. Dog-dung and fleas boiled with sage was a\r\nmedicine for gout, and death-sweat was used as a cure for warts.[918]\r\n\r\nMould from the churchyard is used in some parts of Ireland and in\r\nShetland medicinally. Clay or mould from a priest’s grave boiled with\r\nmilk is given as a decoction for the cure of disease.[919] The dew\r\ncollected from the grave of the last man buried in a churchyard has\r\nbeen used as a lotion for goitre. It is so employed at Launceston.[920]\r\nIn Shetland a stitch in the side was treated by applying mould dug\r\nfrom a grave and heated, the mould was to be taken from and returned\r\nto the grave before sunset.[921] In Lincolnshire a portion of a human\r\nskull taken from the grave was grated and given to epileptics for the\r\ncure of fits. A similar custom prevailed in Kirkwall, at Caithness,\r\nand the Western islands—the patient was made to drink from a suicide’s\r\nskull.[922]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1852 I saw amongst the more precious drugs in the shop of a\r\npharmaceutical chemist at Leamington a bottle labelled in the ordinary\r\nway with the words, “Moss from a Dead-Man’s Skull.” This has long been\r\nused superstitiously, dried, powdered, and taken as snuff, for headache\r\nand bleeding at the nose.[923]\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPATHETICAL CURES.\r\n\r\nA curious chapter in the history of surgery is found in the popular\r\nbelief in “sympathetical cures,” which prevailed in the reigns of\r\nJames I. and Charles I. Sir Kenelm Digby professed to have introduced\r\na method of curing wounds by the “powder of sympathy.” Dr. Pettigrew,,\r\nin his _Superstitions of Medicine and Surgery_, says that a Mr. James\r\nHowel, endeavouring to part some friends who were fighting a duel,\r\nreceived a severe wound in his hand. The king sent one of his own\r\nsurgeons to attend him; but as the wound did not make good progress,\r\napplication was made to Sir Kenelm Digby, who first inquired if the\r\npatient had any article which had the blood upon it. Mr. Howel sent\r\nfor the garter with which his hand had been bound; then a basin of\r\nwater having been brought, Sir Kenelm dissolved therein some powder of\r\nvitriol, and immersed the bloody garter in the solution. The patient\r\nwas instructed to lay aside all his plasters and keep the wound clean\r\nand in a moderate temperature. All the while the garter lay in the\r\nsolution of vitriol. The patient did well; probably if it had been\r\napplied to the injured part it would have made it worse. In the course\r\nof five or six days the wound was cicatrized and a cure effected. Sir\r\nKenelm professed to have learned the secret from a Carmelite friar.\r\nIt was communicated to the king’s physician, Dr. Mayerne, and before\r\nlong every country barber knew of it. Sir Kenelm Digby discoursed on\r\nthe matter before an assembly of nobles and learned men at Montpellier\r\nin France, and endeavoured to explain the action of his powder by all\r\nsorts of conjectures, as emanation of light, the action of impinging\r\nrays, etc. He tried to prove that the spirit which emanated from\r\nthe vitriol became incorporated with the blood, and there met the\r\nexhalation of hot spirits from the inflamed part.\r\n\r\nInfinitely simpler, however, was the process of cure. Nature, left to\r\nherself, did the whole of the work. It seemed, as Dr. Pettigrew says,\r\nthat it had hitherto been the practice of surgeons to place every\r\nobstacle in the way of the union of severed parts of the body. What\r\nwith ointments and various more or less filthy applications, the edges\r\nof the wound were kept apart, and so the healing process was retarded.\r\n\r\nOf a kindred character to the “powder of sympathy” was the “weapon\r\nsalve” of the period. Instead of anointing the wound, the knife, axe,\r\nor other instrument which caused it was smeared with ointment and the\r\nweapon was then carefully wrapped up and put away. Dryden refers to\r\nthis same “weapon salve” in the “Tempest,” Act V. sc. 1. Dr. Pettigrew\r\nsays that the practice was at one time very general.[924]\r\n\r\nThe principle underlying the doctrine of sympathetic powders was\r\nexplained by Sir Kenelm thus: “In time of common contagion they use\r\nto carry about them the powder of a toad, and sometimes a living toad\r\nor spider shut up in a box; or else they carry arsenic, or some other\r\nvenomous substance, which draws unto it the contagious air, which\r\notherwise would infect the party; and the same powder of toad draws\r\nunto it the poison of a pestilential cold. The scurf or farcy is a\r\nvenomous and contagious humour within the body of a horse; hang a toad\r\nabout the neck of the horse in a little bag, and he will be cured\r\ninfallibly; the toad, which is the stronger poison, drawing to it the\r\nvenom which was within the horse.”[925]\r\n\r\nThe same author says that persons of ill breath can be cured by holding\r\ntheir mouths open at a cesspool, the greater stink having the power to\r\ndraw away the less.[926]\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Charles II. a gentleman named Valentine Greatrakes, of\r\na good family and education, “felt an impulse that the gift of curing\r\nthe king’s evil was bestowed upon him.” He published an account of his\r\ncures of this and other diseases, ague, epilepsy, and palsy, and some\r\nother complaints more or less connected with the nervous system, in a\r\nletter to the Hon. Robert Boyle. He seems to have performed his cures,\r\nwhich were by some persons considered miraculous, by a kind of massage,\r\nor “by the Stroaking of the Hands.” The cures were simply the effect of\r\nan excited imagination.[927]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nBATHS AND MINERAL WATERS.\r\n\r\n Miraculous Springs.—The Pool of Bethesda.—Herb-baths.\r\n\r\n\r\nEspecially in Germany mineral waters achieved great popularity in the\r\ntreatment of diseases in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, according to Pliny, Paulus Ægineta, and others,\r\nmineral waters were recognised as possessing curative effects, and\r\nthe temples of health were frequently erected in contiguity to these\r\npowerful aids to treatment. Savages are everywhere fully aware of\r\nthe value of such medicinal waters, and avail themselves of their\r\nbenefits. Hot springs, wherever they occur, are highly esteemed by the\r\nnatives. Humboldt states that on Christianity being introduced into\r\nIceland, the natives refused to be baptized in any but the waters of\r\nthe geysers.[928] Hooker tells us that in the hot springs of Yeuntong,\r\nwhich burst from the bank of the Lachen, in the Himalayas, the natives\r\nremain three days at a time, bathing in the saline and slightly\r\nsulphuretted waters. No better treatment for certain forms of skin\r\ndiseases could be followed.[929] Such a course of treatment is carried\r\nout now at the baths of Leuk, in Switzerland, amongst other places.\r\nThere the patients take their meals and play cards, chess, draughts,\r\netc., while up to their necks in the warm medicinal waters. Hooker\r\ntells us, again, of the use of hot baths amongst the Sikkim Bhoteeas.\r\nThe bath consists of a hollowed prostrate tree trunk, the water of\r\nwhich is heated by throwing in hot stones with bamboo tongs. They\r\ncan raise the temperature to 114°, the patient submitting to this at\r\nintervals for several days, never leaving till wholly exhausted.[930]\r\n\r\nDr. Mead[931] thinks that the Pool of Bethesda, spoken of in the Gospel\r\nof St. John, chap, v., was a medicinal bath, whose virtues principally\r\nresided in the mud which settled at the bottom. It was necessary,\r\ntherefore, that the pool should be “troubled,” that is to say, stirred\r\nup, so that the person bathing therein might derive benefit from the\r\nmetallic salts, “perhaps from sulphur, alum, or nitre,” which settled\r\nat the bottom. Celsus and Pliny recommend medicinal baths for nervous\r\ndisorders. Pliny particularly advises aluminous baths for paralytics,\r\nand adds that “They use the mud of those fountains with advantage,\r\nespecially if, when it is rubbed on, it be suffered to dry in the\r\nsun.”[932]\r\n\r\nMany curious instances of the superstitious uses made of holy wells\r\nin the treatment of disease, in which customs the elements of magic\r\nritual are not difficult to discover, are given in Gomme’s _Ethnology\r\nin Folklore_, pp. 97-99.\r\n\r\nEight miles from Munich lies the village of Heilbrunn (healing spring);\r\ntradition says it is the oldest medicinal spring in Bavaria. Near the\r\nspring was a monastery, said to have been destroyed and the well choked\r\nwith the _débris_ in 935 A.D. In 1509 the monks made some excavations,\r\nand the source of the spring was discovered; at the same time flames\r\nburst forth over it, the phenomena being of course attributed to a\r\nmiracle. The reputation of the medicinal waters brought the Elector’s\r\nwife to the spot in 1659; she derived such benefit from the visit\r\nthat the spring was named after the princess—Adelheid’s Quelle. It\r\nbecame famous amongst the country people for the cure of scrofulous\r\nand other diseases. In 1825 Dr. A. Vogel, of Munich, analysed the\r\nwaters, and found them to contain iodine in important quantity. This\r\nled to the deepening and improvement of the spring, and in the course\r\nof the operations one of the workmen brought a lighted candle close\r\nto the surface of the water; the gas, escaping in bubbles, at once\r\ncaught fire, and the miracle of 1509 was explained. The fact is that\r\na considerable amount of carburetted hydrogen floats over the surface\r\nof the water, and will readily take fire when in contact with a light.\r\nRecent analysis of the water shows that it contains bromine, iodine,\r\nand chloride of sodium, sulphate of soda, carbonates of soda, lime,\r\nmagnesia, and iron. It is altogether one of the most remarkable of the\r\nmedicinal springs, and its composition explains its value in calming\r\nand soothing the mucous membrance of the stomach and other organs. Its\r\ncurative effects have been proved in scrofula, glandular swellings,\r\nbronchial affections, mesenteric and female disorders.[933]\r\n\r\nBaths impregnated with vegetable extracts and odours have long been\r\nin use. Pine-leaves are at present largely employed, and baths of\r\nconium, lavender, hyssop, etc., are still used as sedatives. Anciently\r\nbaths of this kind were as complicated in character as the medicines\r\nadministered internally.\r\n\r\nHere is an ancient prescription for a medicinal bath:—\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAKYNG OF A BATHE MEDICINABLE.[934]\r\n\r\n  “Holy hokke and yardehok peritory[935] and the broun fenelle,[936]\r\n  Walle wort[937] herbe John[938] Sentory[939] rybbewort[940] and\r\n     cammamelle,\r\n  Hey hove[941] heyriff[942] herbe benet[943] brese wort[944] and small\r\n     ache,[945]\r\n  Broke lempk[946] Scabiose[947] Bilgres wild flax is good for ache;\r\n  Wethy leves, grene otes boyld in fere fulle soft,\r\n  Cast them hote in to a vesselle and sett your soverayn alloft,\r\n  And suffire that hete a while as hoot as he may a-bide;\r\n  Se that place be couered welle over and close on every side;\r\n  And what dissese ye be vexed with, grevaunce outher peyn,\r\n  This medicyne shalle make yow hoole surely, as men seyn.”[948]\r\n\r\nGeorge Herbert, in his _Priest to the Temple_, enumerates the duties of\r\nthe parson’s wife, and extols the virtues of these homely remedies.\r\n“For salves, his wife seeks not the city, but prefers her gardens\r\nand fields before all out-landish gums; and surely hyssop, valerian,\r\nmercury, adder’s tongue, melilot, and St. John’s wort, made into a\r\nsalve, and elder, comphrey, and smallage, made into a poultice, have\r\ndone great and rare cures.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWITCHCRAFT AND MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n Comparative Witchcraft.—Laws against Sorcery.—Magic in Virgil\r\n and Horace.—Demonology.—Images of Wax and Clay.—Transference of\r\n Disease.—Witchcraft in the Koran.—White Magic and Black.—Coral and the\r\n Evil Eye.—“Overlooking” People.—Exorcism in the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE WITCHCRAFT.\r\n\r\n“Witches and impostors,” said Bacon, “have always held a competition\r\nwith physicians.” The History of Medicine, therefore, demands some\r\nnotice of the strange delusions which have exerted the most terrible\r\ninfluence over the minds of men in all ages and in all stages of\r\ncivilization. Nothing in the history of the human species is older than\r\nthe belief in magic, and it will be found that the practices of the\r\nsavage in this connection have their analogies amongst ourselves at\r\nthe present day. Gipsy craft, fortune telling, dream interpretation,\r\nspiritualism, the miracles of the theosophists, may all be traced in\r\nthe customs and practices of savage tribes. They are survivals which\r\nwill not be got rid of probably for centuries to come. Education, so\r\nfar from delivering us from the bondage, has curiously enough in many\r\ncases served but to rivet the chains more firmly. In the chapters on\r\nthe demon theory of disease, much light has been thrown on the origin\r\nof our belief in the influence of spirits good and bad. Trials in\r\nEngland connected with witchcraft were most numerous in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. The most interesting is that of the Suffolk witches, when Sir\r\nMatthew Hale was the judge and Sir Thomas Browne the medical expert\r\nwitness. This excellent and learned physician testified that certain\r\nchildren, said to have been bewitched, suffered from fits, heightened\r\nto great excess by the subtlety of the devil co-operating with the\r\nwitches. The report alleges that after conviction of the accused the\r\nchildren immediately recovered.\r\n\r\nWhile condemning the cruelty and severity of the laws against\r\nwitchcraft, and reflecting on the injustice and ignorance with which\r\nthey were enforced, we must remember that in many cases sorcerers and\r\nother dabblers in black magic have added to their supposed supernatural\r\nmethods the very real and serious arts of the poisoner, and the not\r\nless real, though purely mental influences of terror and alarm. To\r\nknow that an evil-minded person was compassing one’s death or was\r\nbusied in bringing about, by diabolical influences, some dreadful\r\nsickness or other injury to one’s person, was quite sufficient, in\r\nignorant and superstitious times, to effect all the evil which it was\r\nin the mind of the magician or witch to induce. But probably there\r\nnever was a regular professional sorcerer who did not use the actual\r\nweapons of poison, or deleterious drugs of some kind or other, to\r\nassist his evil intentions. In the case of the trial of the Countess of\r\nSomerset, in 1616, a charge of witchcraft was joined with the charge of\r\npoisoning Sir Thomas Overbury.[949] Witchcraft and murder were combined\r\nin the Master of Orkney’s case. The last case ever brought before the\r\n“Chambre Ardente” in France resulted in the condemnation, in 1680, of\r\na woman named Voisin, for sorcery and poisoning, in connection with\r\nthe Marquise de Brinvilliers. But even apart from considerations of\r\nmaterial injury, the mental impressions are often fatal enough; thus,\r\nin the Pacific Islands, to quote but one instance, magical arts have\r\nbeen proved effective through the patient’s own imagination. “When he\r\nknows or fancies that he has been bewitched, he will fall ill, and he\r\nwill actually die unless he can be persuaded that he has been cured.\r\nThus, wherever sorcery is practised with the belief of its victims,\r\nsome system of exorcism or some protective magical art becomes, not\r\nonly necessary, but actually effective—a mental disease being met by\r\na mental remedy to match it.”[950] Hearne, when travelling in North\r\nAmerica, was entreated by an Indian to give him a charm against an\r\nenemy (savages and primitive folk are great believers in white men as\r\nmagicians). Hearne complied, and for fun, drew on a sheet of paper\r\nsome circles, signs, and words. The Indian took care to let his victim\r\nknow that he had “medicine” against him, and the poor wretch fell sick\r\nimmediately, and shortly afterwards died. Cockayne quotes from Wier an\r\naccount of a woman who wore an amulet to cure bad eyes, which were made\r\nworse by her constantly flowing tears. Some one who hated sorceries\r\ninduced her to open and examine the charm. When unfolded, the paper\r\nshowed nothing but these words: “May the devil scratch thine eyes\r\nout, and —— in the holes.” As soon as the woman saw how she had been\r\ndeceived, she lost faith, took to crying again, and her eyes became as\r\nbad as ever.[951]\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW AGAINST SORCERY.\r\n\r\nAt the accession of James I. of England, a law against witchcraft was\r\npassed, which continued in force for more than a century. We quote it\r\nin full (1 Jac. i. c. 12):—\r\n\r\n“If any person or persons shall use, practise, or exercise any\r\ninvocation or conjuration of any evil and wicked spirit, or shall\r\nconsult, covenant with, entertain, employ, feed, or reward any evil and\r\nwicked spirit, to or for any intent or purpose, or take up any dead\r\nman, woman, or child out of his, her, or their grave, or any other\r\nplace where the dead body resteth, or the skin, bone, or any part of\r\nany dead person, to be employed or used in any manner of witchcraft,\r\nsorcery, charm, or enchantment, or shall use, practise, or exercise any\r\nwitchcraft, enchantment, charm, or sorcery, whereby any person shall be\r\nkilled, destroyed, wasted, consumed, pined, or lamed in his or her body\r\nor any part thereof, every such offender is a felon without benefit of\r\nclergy.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGIC AND MEDICINE.\r\n\r\nPliny says that the art of magic first originated in medicine, and that\r\nunder the guise of promoting health it insinuated itself among mankind\r\nas a higher and more holy branch of the medical art. Then it added the\r\nreligious element, and lastly incorporated with itself the astrological\r\nart, and so enthralled the senses of man by a three-fold bond.[952]\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGIC IN VIRGIL AND HORACE.\r\n\r\nThe sorceress of Virgil is a witch whose ancestry we shall have no\r\ndifficulty in tracing anthropologically. We can discover her lineage\r\nfrom the parent witches of savage tribes, and we detect her offspring\r\nin the sorceress of our own times. She burns vervain and frankincense,\r\nchaunts a solemn lay, binds the victim’s image with fillets of three\r\ncolours, and in binding the knots makes the attendant say, “Thus do\r\nI bind the fillets of Venus.” One wax and one clay image are placed\r\nbefore the fire, and as the clay image hardens, so does the heart of\r\nDaphnis harden towards his new mistress; and as the wax softens, so is\r\nthe heart of Daphnis made tender towards the sorceress. She buries the\r\nrelics of what had belonged to Daphnis beneath her threshold; bruises\r\npoisonous plants from Pontus to enable him to transform himself into a\r\nwolf, and orders her attendant to cast the ashes of these herbs over\r\nher head into a running stream, at the same time taking care not to\r\nglance behind her.[953] Horace also describes the concoction of a charm\r\nin a perfectly orthodox style whose family history is intelligible\r\nenough to the student of comparative sorcery. There is nothing in the\r\nclassic witchcraft which does not exist to-day in the islands of savage\r\npeoples, and the methods of medicine-men in primitive forests.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMAGES OF WAX, ETC., IN SORCERY.\r\n\r\nA very widespread and ancient method of compassing a person’s death\r\nby witchcraft is that of making a figure in wax, or other plastic\r\nmaterial, to represent the victim of the incantation. The object seems\r\nto be the concentration of will-power to effect the wishes of the\r\nuser of the charm. There is an innate belief that words are creative\r\nsymbols; it may be derived from the perception of the power of man to\r\neffect that which he desires earnestly to effect, so that “whenever a\r\ngood or evil wish,” as Dr. Tylor says, “is uttered in words, it becomes\r\na blessing or curse.” This idea lies at the root of what is called\r\n“Christian science healing,” _i.e._ healing by good wishes. In its evil\r\nform we have an ancient example in Ovid’s sorceress:[954]—\r\n\r\nKing James, in his _Dæmonology_, says that “The devil teacheth how to\r\nmake pictures of wax or clay, that by roasting thereof the persons\r\nthat they bear the name of may be continually melted or dried away by\r\ncontinual sickness.”\r\n\r\nSo the Governor-General of a Chinese province recently issued a\r\nproclamation, whereby it was declared unlawful to bring about the death\r\nof others by incantations. “You are forbidden,” said Governor Wang,\r\n“if you have a grudge against any one, to practise the magic called\r\n‘Striking the Bull’s Head,’ that is to say, writing a man’s name and\r\nage on a scrap of paper, and laying it before the bull-headed idol,\r\nand then buying an iron stamp and piercing small holes in this paper,\r\nand finally throwing it at the man on the sly, with the intention of\r\ncompassing his death.”[955]\r\n\r\n“So recently,” says the authoress of _Wanderings in China_, “as\r\nDecember, 1883, a case was tried at the Inverness police court, in\r\nwhich the cause of offence was the discovery of a clay image with\r\npins stuck through it in order to compass the death of a neighbour, a\r\ndiscovery which resulted in an assault. Many similar cases have been\r\ndiscovered both in England and Scotland.”[956]\r\n\r\n“The demon-priests of Ceylon,” says Gomme,[957] “make use of images of\r\nwax or wood, which represent the person to be injured. They drive nails\r\ninto the points which represent the heart, the head, etc., mark the\r\nname of the intended victim on it, and bury it where he is likely to\r\npass over it.” Plato alludes to the same practice as obtaining amongst\r\nthe Greeks of his period.[958]\r\n\r\nThere are very similar Scotch practices.\r\n\r\nIt was anciently believed that diseases could be transferred from one\r\nperson to another. Says Pliny,[959] “Take the parings of the toe-nails\r\nand finger-nails of a sick person and mix them up with wax, the party\r\nsaying that he is seeking a remedy for a tertian, quartan, or quotidian\r\nfever, as the case may be; then stick this wax, before sunrise, upon\r\nthe door of another person. Such is the prescription they give for\r\nthese diseases.”\r\n\r\nGomme says[960] that St. Tegla’s well, about half-way between Wrexham\r\nand Ruthin, is resorted to for the cure of epilepsy. The patient offers\r\na cock, or if a woman, a hen. The bird is carried in a basket, first\r\nround the well, and then round the church. The patient enters the\r\nchurch, creeps under the altar, and remains there till morning. Having\r\nmade an offering, he leaves the cock and departs. If the bird dies, it\r\nis supposed that the disease has been transferred to it, and the man or\r\nwoman consequently cured.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe use of wax figures in enchantments is, as we have shown, very\r\nancient, and it has lasted up to the present time. Simœtha in\r\nTheocritus says: “As I melt this wax by the help of the goddess, so may\r\nMyndian Delphis be presently wasted by love.”[961] And Horace refers to\r\nit:—\r\n\r\n                “Lanea et effigies evat, altera cerea.”\r\n                                              (Lib. i., Sat. 8, l. 30.)\r\n\r\nParacelsus advises the patient afflicted with St. Vitus’ dance to\r\nmake an image of himself in wax or resin, and by an effort of mind\r\nto concentrate all his blasphemies and sins in it, “without the\r\nintervention of any other person, to set his whole mind and thoughts\r\nconcerning these oaths on the image.” Having done this, he was to\r\ndestroy the image by fire.[962]\r\n\r\nPliny says[963] that abrotonum (which was probably southernwood), “if\r\nput beneath the pillow, will act as an aphrodisiac, and that it is\r\nof the very greatest efficacy against all those charms and spells by\r\nwhich impotence is produced.” As an antaphrodisiac he recommends the\r\ntamarisk, mixed in a drink or in food with the urine of an ox.[964]\r\n\r\nAmongst the Tamils of Ceylon there is a ceremony performed with the\r\nskull of a child, with the design of producing the death of the person\r\nagainst whom the incantation is directed. Cabalistic figures are drawn\r\nupon the skull after it has been duly prepared. The name of the person\r\nto be destroyed by the charm is also written on the skull. Then a paste\r\nis composed with his saliva, some of his hair, and a little earth on\r\nwhich he has imprinted his footsteps, and this is spread upon a plate,\r\nand taken with the skull to the cemetery of the place, where for forty\r\nnights the evil spirits are invoked to destroy the denounced person.\r\nThe natives believe that as the paste dries on the plate, the victim of\r\nthe charm will waste and die.[965]\r\n\r\n“Both Greeks and savages,” says Mr. A. Lang,[966] “have worshipped\r\nthe ghosts of the dead. Both Greeks and savages assign to their gods\r\nthe miraculous powers of transformation and magic, which savages also\r\nattribute to their conjurors or shamans. The mantle (if he had a\r\nmantle) of the medicine-man has fallen on the god; but Zeus, or Indra,\r\nwas not once a real medicine-man.”\r\n\r\nIn the Kalevala the hero of the poem wounds himself with an axe. The\r\nwound can only be healed by one who knows the mystic words that hold\r\nthe secret of the birth of iron. Iron is the bane of warlike men; when\r\nthe wizard curses the iron as a living thing, the hero is healed.[967]\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOTS.\r\n\r\nJustin Martyr says that the Jews used magic ties or knots in their\r\nexorcisms. The Babylonians did the same. When the god Marduk writes to\r\nsoothe the last moments of a dying man, Hea says, “Take a woman’s linen\r\nkerchief, bind it round thy right hand; loose it from the left hand,\r\nknot it with seven knots; do so twice.”[968]\r\n\r\nThe 113th chapter of the Koran was written by Mohammed when he was\r\nsuffering from an illness of a rheumatic character, and he believed\r\nthat it was caused by some evil person who had bewitched him. The\r\nchapter runs thus:—\r\n\r\n“Say, I fly for refuge unto the Lord of the daybreak, that he may\r\ndeliver me from the mischief of those things which he hath created; and\r\nfrom the mischief of the night when it cometh on; and from the mischief\r\nof woman blowing on knots; and from the mischief of the envious,\r\nwhen he envieth.” Sales’ notes on this chapter explain the singular\r\nexpression about knots; he says: “That is, of witches, who used to tie\r\nknots in a cord, and to blow on them, uttering at the same time certain\r\nmagical words over them, in order to debilitate the person they had\r\na mind to injure.” Wizards in the north who pretend to sell mariners\r\na wind do something similar, and the French _Nouër l’aiguillete_ is\r\nof the same character. This bewitchment by the knot was called by\r\nthe Romans Nodus and Obligamentum. Mr. Cockayne says[969] the Saxons\r\ntranslated it into lyb, _drug_, φάρμακον. It was believed that a man\r\nmight lose his power by being put under a knot, and there are cures for\r\nthis injury in the _Leechbook_. We find protections “contra maleficium\r\nligaturæ ut vocant.” Priests are warned not to make any alterations\r\nin the mode of conducting the marriage service by any reason of these\r\nknots.[970]\r\n\r\nOf course, as in all other kinds of witchcraft, actual poisons often\r\nhad much to do with the magic.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE MAGIC.\r\n\r\nAs there is White Magic, which according to popular belief is\r\nbeneficent, and Black Magic, which is diabolical and hurtful, so\r\nthere are white witches and black ones. The white can help, but not\r\nhurt. Cotta says:[971] “The mention of witchcraft doth now occasion\r\nthe remembrance in the next place of a sort of practitioners whom our\r\ncustome and country doth call wise men and wise women, reputed a kind\r\nof good and harmless witches or wizards, who by good words, by hallowed\r\nherbes, and salves, and other superstitious ceremonies, promise to\r\nallay and calme divels, practices of other witches, and the forces\r\nof many diseases.” The last lingering remains of such wise women may\r\nbe found in the poorer quarters of all our great towns as well as in\r\ncountry places; they sell herbs, and always have a special ointment\r\nor salve which cures everything. This is called “Old Maids’ Salve,”\r\nor some such name, and the sellers may often be known by the pile of\r\nlittle chip or willow boxes displayed in a shop or front window in\r\nback streets. “White” as they are, they often, it is suspected, give\r\nimproper advice to women.\r\n\r\nA third species of witch was recognised—a mixture of white and black,\r\ncalled grey witches, who could help and hurt.[972]\r\n\r\nBlaise Pascal, when an infant a year old, was supposed to have been\r\nbewitched by an old woman, who ultimately confessed that she had in\r\nfact so influenced his health.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK MAGIC.\r\n\r\nThe following “revelation” of the proceedings of sorcerers is from the\r\n_Mysteries of Magic_ by Waite,[973] and was taken by him from the works\r\nof Eliphas Lévi.[974]\r\n\r\n“They procure either some of the hair or garments of the person whom\r\nthey wish to curse; then they choose an animal which they consider the\r\nsymbol of that person by means of the hair or garments; they place this\r\nanimal in magnetic rapport with the individual; they give it his name,\r\nthen they slay it with one blow of the magic knife, open its breast,\r\ntear out the heart, which they envelop while still palpitating in the\r\nmagnetised object, and for three days they hourly pierce this heart\r\nwith nails, red-hot pins, or long thorns, pronouncing maledictions\r\nat the same time on the name of the bewitched person. They are then\r\nconvinced (and often rightly) that the victim of their infamous\r\nmanœuvres experiences as many torments as if he had himself been probed\r\nto the heart with every one of the points. He begins to waste away, and\r\nat the end of a certain time dies of an unknown complaint.” Another\r\nproceeding is to take a large toad, “baptism is administered to it, and\r\nit is given the name and surname of the person whom it is desired to\r\ncurse; it is made to swallow a consecrated host whereon the formulæ of\r\nexecration have been pronounced; then it is enveloped in the magnetised\r\nobjects, bound with the hair of the victim, on which the operator has\r\npreviously spat, and the whole is buried either beneath the threshold\r\nof the bewitched person’s door or in a place which he is bound to pass\r\ndaily.”[975]\r\n\r\nThe most important part of the body of a person to be bewitched is a\r\ntooth, but the hair or blood will answer fairly well.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVIL EYE.\r\n\r\nThe use of red coral for warding off the evil eye is at least as old as\r\nthe times of the ancient Romans; they used coral necklaces for their\r\nbabies as we do now, but not for ornament so much as for protection\r\nfrom supernatural danger. In Italy, especially in the parts round\r\nNaples, red coral charms in the shape of a partly closed hand, or\r\npieces of coral the shape of a tiny carrot, are worn for the purpose of\r\nprotecting the wearer from being bewitched by the _mal occhio_.\r\n\r\nThe last-named charm is evidently phallic.\r\n\r\nThe belief in witchcraft which still exists not only amongst the\r\nignorant and degraded, but also amongst cultivated and intelligent\r\npersons, has recently been illustrated by two cases reported in the\r\npress, which it may be well to quote in this connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n“EXTRAORDINARY SUPERSTITION.\r\n\r\n“An inquest was held yesterday at Lufton, a village near Yeovil, on the\r\nbody of Mary Jane Saunders, aged twenty-two, who died under peculiar\r\ncircumstances. The evidence of the sister of the deceased showed the\r\nlatter took to her bed last October. A doctor attended her, and in\r\nNovember she went into Yeovil hospital. Deceased had not had her reason\r\nfor the last six weeks. Her father and mother called in a herbalist,\r\nwho remained one day and night. Her mother thought her daughter was\r\nsuffering from a ‘bad wish,’ and that it was in consequence of that she\r\nwas ill. Her mother had heard that the herbalist had cured two people\r\nat Montacute of ‘bad wishes,’ and that was why they went to him. The\r\nherbalist made some herb tea for deceased to get rid of the ‘bad wish.’\r\nHer father and mother thought the deceased had been ‘overlooked.’\r\nThe father told the coroner he was ‘overlooked’ when he was a baby,\r\nand had a spell on him, and some one did him good. The herbalist who\r\nvisited deceased said he thoroughly believed one person could put a\r\nspell on another. It was in the Bible, but it was a pity it should be\r\nso. The mother of deceased said they thought some one had cast a ‘bad\r\nwish’ over the deceased, and they tried to get it taken away. They\r\npaid 11_s._ for the herbalist’s medicine to remove the ‘bad wish.’ Dr.\r\nWalters said deceased died of inflammation and softening of the brain,\r\nand a verdict in accordance with that opinion was returned.”[976]\r\n\r\n_The Daily Telegraph_ of November 21st, 1892, has the following:—\r\n\r\n\r\n“TRIAL FOR WITCHCRAFT.\r\n\r\n”BERLIN, Nov. 20.—The Court of Eichstaett in Bavaria has just given\r\njudgment in the action for slander arising out of the extraordinary\r\ncase of exorcism which occurred some months ago in Bavaria, when a\r\ncertain Father Aurelian exorcised a boy named Zilk in his parish, who\r\nwas said to be possessed of a devil.\r\n\r\n“Father Aurelian declared that the evil spirit entered the boy’s body\r\nthrough the witchcraft of a Protestant woman named Herz, and the\r\nlatter accordingly instituted proceedings against him for slander. The\r\nceremony of exorcism was performed in presence of a Capuchin friar.\r\nnamed Wolf, and other persons, and Father Aurelian, in the report which\r\nhe drew up of the case, declared that the devil only quitted the boy\r\nafter long resistance.\r\n\r\n“Friar Wolf, who was one of a long list of witnesses called for the\r\ndefence, confirmed the correctness of the defendant’s report as to the\r\ncircumstances under which the exorcism had been performed.\r\n\r\n“Father Pruner, the Provost of the Cathedral, who was called to give\r\nevidence as to the theological aspects of the matter, testified that,\r\naccording to the teaching of the Church, the possibility of demoniac\r\npossession was indisputable; and he gave an account of the doctrine\r\nconcerning demons and evil spirits. He declared that Father Aurelian\r\nhad recognised the signs of possession as taught by the Schools, and\r\nhad acted as he ought to have done under the circumstances. After\r\npointing out that even the Civil Law recognised the possibility of\r\ncovenants between mankind and the devil, he went on to affirm that the\r\nChurch could compel the devil to speak the truth. This was to support\r\nthe line of defence set up by Father Aurelian that before quitting the\r\nbody of the boy the devil himself, speaking through the possessed, had\r\ninformed him that Frau Herz had bewitched the boy by means of some\r\nfruit which she had given him.\r\n\r\n“Prior Schneider, who was summoned as an expert in demonology, also\r\nexplained his views on the spirit world.\r\n\r\n“Herr Straub, the Public Prosecutor, said the question before the\r\nCourt was not whether Father Aurelian had transgressed the law in\r\nexorcising the boy, but whether he had slandered the plaintiff. This,\r\nhe maintained, the defendant had done, and he demanded damages to\r\nthe extent of fifty marks, asking this small sum because it was not\r\ncontended that Frau Herz had suffered any material loss through the\r\nallegations made against her.\r\n\r\n“Frau Herz, in evidence, denied having bewitched the boy, and declared\r\nthat the fruit had not been given to Zilk by her, but by a maidservant.\r\nHer own children had also partaken of the fruit without suffering any\r\nill effects. Ever since the slander spread by Father Aurelian, however,\r\nshe had been called ‘A witch’ by the whole neighbourhood, and her\r\nchildren had been called ‘Witch-children’ by their comrades in school.\r\n\r\n“Ultimately the Court gave judgment in accordance with the Public\r\nProsecutor’s demand, finding that Father Aurelian had uttered the\r\nslander, and imposing upon him a fine of fifty marks with costs, or\r\nfive days’ imprisonment.”\r\n\r\nHow little power any cultivation of the mind, except that which is\r\npurely scientific, has against this degrading superstition!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL SUPERSTITIONS.\r\n\r\n Death and the Grave.—Sorcerer’s Ointment.—Teeth-worms.—Disease\r\n Transference.—Doctrine of Signatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERSTITIONS CONNECTED WITH DEATH AND THE GRAVE.\r\n\r\nThere is a very common saying amongst ignorant persons, when they\r\nsuddenly shudder without reason, that some one is walking over their\r\ngrave. In New England it is believed that cramp in the feet can be\r\ncured by walking over a grave. Earth taken at midnight from a newly\r\nmade grave is believed in some parts of England to have a curative\r\neffect. Crawling round newly made graves is thought useful in sickness\r\nin Devonshire. Churchyard grass has been used (as what has not?) as an\r\nantidote to hydrophobia. Even in Afghanistan graves have a reputation\r\nfor curing diseases.[977]\r\n\r\n“In the middle ages the necromancers profaned tombs and compounded\r\nphiltres and ointments with the grease and blood of corpses; they mixed\r\naconite, belladonna, and poisonous fungi therewith; then they boiled\r\nand skimmed these frightful mixtures over fires composed of human\r\nremains and crucifixes stolen from churches; they added the dust of\r\ndried toads and the ashes of consecrated hosts; then they rubbed their\r\nforeheads, hands, and stomachs with the infernal ointment, drew the\r\nsatanic pentacle, and evoked the dead beneath gibbets or in desecrated\r\ncemeteries.”[978]\r\n\r\nBaptista Porta gives the recipe for the sorceress’ ointment in his\r\n_Natural Magic_. By means of this charm the witches were carried to\r\ntheir Sabbath. It was composed of children’s fat, of aconite boiled\r\nwith poplar leaves, and some other drugs; soot must be mixed with\r\nthese, and the bodies of the sorceresses rubbed all over with the\r\ncompound as they went to the Sabbath naked. Another recipe from the\r\nworks of the same author runs thus:—\r\n\r\n_Recipe—Suim, acorum vulgare, pentaphyllon, vespertillionis sanguinem,\r\nsolanum somniferum et oleum_, the whole to be well boiled and stirred\r\nto the consistence of an ointment.[979]\r\n\r\nBits of the rope and chips from the gallows after the hanging of a\r\ncriminal have long had a reputation in England as cures for headache\r\nand ague. The touch of a dead man’s hand at the place of execution was\r\nformerly considered very efficacious for some complaints.\r\n\r\nDyer says that between Suffolk and Norfolk a favourite remedy for\r\nwhooping-cough is to put the head of the suffering child into a hole\r\nmade in a meadow for a few minutes. It must be done in the evening,\r\nwith only the father and mother to witness it.[980]\r\n\r\nA knife that has killed a man is an amulet worn against disease in\r\nChina. A piece of skin taken with a black-handled knife from a male\r\ncorpse which has been buried nine days is an Irish love charm.[981]\r\n\r\nPeople in North Hampshire sometimes wear a tooth taken from a corpse,\r\nkept in a little bag, and hung round the neck, as a remedy for\r\ntoothache. Bones from churchyards have from old times been used as\r\ncharms against disease. Coffin water is considered good for warts, and\r\nthe water with which a corpse has been washed has been recently given\r\nto a man in Glasgow as a remedy for fits.[982]\r\n\r\n\r\nTEETH WORMS.\r\n\r\nA very curious remedy for toothache is founded on the idea that the\r\ndisease is caused by a worm, and that henbane seed roasted will extract\r\nthe worm. _The Englishman’s Doctor; or the School of Salerne_, an\r\nEnglish translation of a book published in 1607, has a few lines on\r\nthis superstition which run thus:—\r\n\r\n    “If in your teeth you hap to be tormented,\r\n      By meane some little wormes therein do breed,\r\n    Which pain (if heed be tane) may be prevented,\r\n      Be keeping cleane your teeth, when as you feede;\r\n    Burne Francomsence (a gum not evil sented),\r\n      Put Henbane unto this, and Onyon seed,\r\n    And with a tunnel to the tooth that’s hollow,\r\n      Convey the smoke thereof, and ease shall follow.”[983]\r\n\r\nEvery druggist even at the present day sells henbane seed for the same\r\npurpose; it is used by sprinkling it on hot cinders. The heat causes\r\nthe seed to sprout, and an appearance similar to a maggot is produced,\r\nwhich is ignorantly supposed by the purchaser of the drug to have\r\ndropped from the tooth to which the smoke is applied. Very strangely\r\nthis belief that toothache is caused by a worm is found all over the\r\nworld.[984]\r\n\r\nThat dental caries is actually caused by an organism (the _Leptothrix\r\nbuccalis_), which is found in teeth slime, and the threads of which\r\npenetrate the tissue of the teeth after the enamel has been eaten away\r\nby acids generated by the fermentation of the food, is not of course\r\nknown to peasants and ignorant persons; they seem, however, to have in\r\nthis instance anticipated a discovery in bacteriology.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASE TRANSFERENCE.\r\n\r\nWhen primitive folk found that diseases could be communicated from one\r\nperson to another, that contagious and infectious complaints spread\r\nthrough a district with terrible rapidity and fatal effects, they\r\nbegan to argue that it must be possible to transfer diseases to other\r\ncreatures than man. And so we find stomach-ache transferred from the\r\npatient to a puppy or a duck.[985] Hooping-cough is transmitted to dogs\r\nby hairs of the patient given between slices of bread-and-butter. Ague\r\nand scarlet-fever are transmitted to the ass on which the sufferer\r\nsits; toothache is passed on to a frog by spitting in its mouth. Even\r\ntrees are considered able to relieve patients of ague. Mr. Tylor says:\r\n“In Thuringia it is considered that a string of rowan berries, a rag,\r\nor any small article touched by a sick person, and then hung on a bush\r\nbeside some forest path, imparts the malady to any person who may touch\r\nthis article in passing, and frees the sick man from the disease.\r\nThis gives great probability to Captain Burton’s suggestion, that the\r\nrags, locks of hair, and what not hung on trees near sacred places, by\r\nthe superstitious, from Mexico to India, and Ethiopia to Ireland, are\r\ndeposited there as actual receptacles for transference of disease.”[986]\r\n\r\nInnumerable transference superstitions are met with concerning warts,\r\nand these have doubtless arisen from the very remarkable manner in\r\nwhich they sometimes disappear. In some cases what are taken to be\r\nwarts by those not skilled in skin diseases are merely a papular\r\neruption of a fugitive kind, which suddenly appears on the back of the\r\nhands and as suddenly vanishes. As real warts, however, often arise\r\nfrom constitutional causes, they will naturally disappear with improved\r\ngeneral health; and this fact has been the fruitful parent of a host of\r\nsuperstitions.\r\n\r\nMr. Black gives several of these. He says: “Lancashire wise men tell\r\nus for warts to rub them with a cinder, and this tied up in paper,\r\nand dropped where four roads meet (_i.e._, where the roads cross),\r\nwill transfer the warts to whoever opens the parcel. Another mode of\r\ntransferring warts is to touch each wart with a pebble, and place the\r\npebbles in a bag, which should be lost on the way to church; whoever\r\nfinds the bag gets the warts.”[987]\r\n\r\nA common Warwickshire custom is to rub the warts with a black snail,\r\nstick the snail on a thorn bush, and then, say the folk, as the snail\r\ndies so will the wart disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIDOTES.\r\n\r\nAnother old medical superstition is that every natural poison carries\r\nwithin itself its own antidote. Galen, Pliny, and Dioscorides say that\r\nthe poison of Spanish fly exists in the body, and the head and wings\r\ncontain the antidote. “A hair of the dog that bit you,” is the ancient\r\nway of stating a belief that the hairs of a rabid dog are the true\r\nspecific for hydrophobia. The fat of the viper was long regarded as the\r\nremedy for its bite. In black-letter books on Demonology we learn that\r\n“three scruples of the ashes of the witch, when she has been well and\r\ncarefully burnt at a stake, is a sure catholicon against all the evil\r\neffects of witchcraft.”[988]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURES.\r\n\r\nBy nothing have the annals of medicine been more disgraced than by\r\nthe absurd and preposterous “Doctrine of Signatures.” Dr. Paris, in\r\nhis _Pharmacologia_, describes it as the belief that “every natural\r\nsubstance which possesses any medicinal virtues, indicates, by an\r\nobvious and well-marked external character, the disease for which it\r\nis a remedy or the object for which it should be employed.” Thus the\r\nplant which is common in our woods, called “Lungwort” (_Pulmonaria\r\nofficinalis_), was anciently considered good for chest complaints,\r\nbecause its leaves bear a fancied resemblance to the surface of the\r\nlungs. The root of the “mandrake,” from its supposed resemblance to\r\nthe human form, was a very ancient medicine for barrenness, and was so\r\nesteemed by Rachel (Genesis xxx. 14).\r\n\r\nPliny, Dioscorides, and other writers attribute peculiar virtues to\r\nthe mineral _Lapis Ætites_, or eagle-stone, because the nodule within\r\nthe stone rattles when it is shaken. “_Ætites lapis agitatus sonitum\r\nedit, velut ex altero lapide prægnans._” The yellow drug _turmeric_\r\nwas held to be a cure for jaundice because it is yellow. Poppies have\r\ntheir capsules shaped somewhat like a skull, therefore they were\r\nconsidered appropriate to relieve diseases of the head. _Euphrasia_,\r\nour eye-bright, was a famous application for eye diseases, because its\r\nflowers are somewhat like the pupil of the eye. Nettle-tea by the same\r\nrule is a country remedy for nettle-rash (urticaria). The petals of the\r\nred rose bear the “signature” of the blood, the roots of rhubarb and\r\nthe flowers of saffron those of the bile.\r\n\r\nA person who believes himself bewitched by execration and the interment\r\nof a toad, should carry about him a living toad.\r\n\r\nSouthey says,[989] “The signatures [were] the books out of which the\r\nancients first learned the virtues of herbs—Nature—having stamped\r\non divers of them legible characters to discover their uses.” Every\r\nhealing plant, it was thought, bears in some part of its structure\r\nthe type or signature of its peculiar virtue. Oswald Crollius is\r\nsupposed to have been “the great discoverer of signatures.” Some of\r\nthese strange fancies are as fantastic as those of Swedenborg. Walnuts\r\nwere considered to be the perfect signature of the head, the shell\r\nas the skull and the convolutions of the kernel as those of the two\r\nhemispheres of the brain, the outer skin would represent the scalp. So\r\nthe signature doctors used the husks for scalp wounds, the inner peel\r\nfor disorders of the _dura mater_, and the kernel was “very profitable\r\nfor the brain and resists poisons.” The peony when in bud being\r\nsomething like a man’s head was “very available against the falling\r\nsickness.” Poppy-heads for the same reason were used “with success” in\r\ngeneral diseases of the head. Lilies-of-valley were known by signature\r\nto cure apoplexy; as Coles says, “for as that disease is caused by the\r\ndropping of humours into the principal ventricles of the brain, so the\r\nflowers of this lily hanging on the plants as if they were drops, are\r\nof wonderful use herein.”\r\n\r\nCapillary herbs naturally announced themselves as good for diseases of\r\nthe hair. The stone crop “hath the signature of the gums,” and so was\r\nused for scurvy. The scales of pine-cones were used for the toothache,\r\nbecause they resemble the front teeth. Prickly plants like thistles\r\nand holly were used for pleurisy and stitch in the side. Saxifrage was\r\ngood for the stone; kidney beans ought to have been useful for kidney\r\ndiseases, but seem to have been overlooked except as articles of diet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n The Sciences accessory to Medicine.—The great\r\n Schools of Medical Theory.—Boerhaave and his\r\n System.—Stahl.—Hoffman.—Cullen.—Brown.—Hospitals.—Bichat and the\r\n New Era of Anatomy.—Mesmer and Mesmerism.—Surgery.—The Anatomists,\r\n Physiologists, and Scientists of the Period.—Inoculation and\r\n Vaccination.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe medical history of the eighteenth century affords but a meagre\r\nresult, notwithstanding the brilliant talents and indefatigable\r\nindustry of the famous men who devoted their energies to the healing\r\nart. Their great aim was to create systems of medicine which should be\r\nphilosophical and complete.\r\n\r\nIt is not only in what is strictly the art of healing that the\r\nmembers of the medical profession have ever been amongst the\r\ngreatest benefactors of the world, but in what are known as the\r\naccessory sciences many of the most distinguished, enlightened, and\r\nself-sacrificing of the heroes of science have been affiliated to\r\nthe profession of medicine. Not only the heroes, but the martyrs\r\nof medicine, crowd the scientific calendar. The seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries were fertile in the efforts to apply the\r\nresults of discoveries in the physical sciences to the relief of\r\nhuman suffering. If these efforts were but partially successful, so\r\nfar as medicine—considered apart from surgery—was concerned, it was\r\nnot in consequence of less industry in that department, but because\r\nspeculation and theorising about the causes of disease monopolised\r\nthe attention which, if devoted to observation of facts, would have\r\nbeen fertile in result. Schools, Systems, and Sects were the chief\r\nproduct of the medical activity of the eighteenth century. Although not\r\nperhaps of much direct benefit to medicine, indirectly the study of the\r\nsciences accessory to it must have been of considerable benefit as an\r\neducational factor in the training of the intellect of physicians.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT SCHOOLS OF MEDICAL THEORY.\r\n\r\nWhewell, in his _History of Scientific Ideas_,[990] classifies the\r\nsuccessive biological hypotheses under the heads: (1) THE MYSTICAL\r\nSCHOOL; (2) THE IATRO-CHEMICAL SCHOOL; (3) THE IATRO-MATHEMATICAL\r\nSCHOOL; (4) THE VITAL-FLUID SCHOOL; (5) THE PSYCHICAL SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTICAL SCHOOL found its most distinguished representative\r\nin Paracelsus; it derived its doctrine of the _Macrocosm_ and the\r\n_Microcosm_ from the Neoplatonists, and was largely imbued with alchemy\r\nand magic, the doctrines of the Cabala and the fanciful interpretations\r\nof the Bible. Later Paracelsists, Rosicrucians, and other speculators\r\nof the same character, such as Sir Kenelm Digby, brought the Mystical\r\nSchool of Medicine down to the seventeenth century. Our modern\r\nTheosophists are striving to restore much of the mystical teaching of\r\nParacelsus and his followers. Again we meet the “astral bodies,” “the\r\nelementary spirits,” the cabalistic interpretations of the Bible, and\r\nthe astrological absurdities of a pre-scientific period.\r\n\r\nTHE IATRO-CHEMICAL SCHOOL really arose from PARACELSUS, who amongst\r\nmany absurdities held much important truth. SPRENGEL indicates LIBAVIUS\r\nof Saxony as the person who first cultivated chemistry apart from\r\ntheosophy, and he names ANGELUS SALA as his successor. LEMERY, in the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century, began to reform pharmaceutical\r\nchemistry. After PARACELSUS chemistry became an indispensable study to\r\nevery physician. Our word _tartar_, the scale which forms on the teeth,\r\nis of Paracelsian origin. He taught that the basis of all diseases was\r\na thickening of the juices and the formation of earthy matter, which\r\nhe called _Tartarus_, because it burns like the fire of hell. After\r\nPARACELSUS we have VAN HELMONT, a true chemical discoverer who sought\r\nin chemistry a theory of disease of which his doctrine of fermentation\r\nin the body holds an important place. Next we have SYLVIUS, with his\r\ndoctrine of the opposition of acid and alkali. Digestion he considered\r\na process of fermentation or effervescence of the acid of the saliva\r\nand pancreatic juice with the alkali of the gall. When either the acid\r\nor the alkali predominated, disease was supposed to follow. The human\r\nbody was regarded as a laboratory, the stomach as a sort of test tube.\r\nBOYLE made objections to the doctrines of this school, and HERMAN\r\nCONRING taught that the proper place of chemistry was not in physiology\r\nand pathology, but in pharmacy.\r\n\r\nVIRIDET of Geneva endeavoured to prove that the fluids of the body are\r\neither acid or alkaline by experiment. RAIMOND VIEUSSENS declared that\r\nhe had discovered an acid in the blood and a ferment in the stomach.\r\nHECQUET opposed him, and said that digestion was not a process of\r\nfermentation, but of trituration. PITCAIRN in England, BOHN and HOFFMAN\r\nin Germany, and BOERHAAVE in Holland opposed the iatro-chemists, and\r\nproved by observation that digestion is not fermentation, and that the\r\nacid and alkali theories of disease supported by SYLVIUS were false.\r\nBy the influence and authority of these eminent physicians, the reign\r\nof the chemical school of physiology was overturned. The great fault\r\nof the iatro-chemists was their neglect of the effect of the solids of\r\nthe animal body; they assimilated the work of the physician, as Whewell\r\nsays, to that of the vintner or the brewer.\r\n\r\nTHE IATRO-MATHEMATICAL or MECHANICAL SCHOOL attacked, defeated, and\r\nsuperseded the iatro-chemists. According to this sect, the human body\r\nis a mere machine. Whewell explains that the Mechanical Physiologists\r\ncame into existence in consequence of the splendid results obtained\r\nby the schools of Galileo and Newton. It was not so much the exposure\r\nof the weaknesses of the chemical physiology as the effects produced\r\nupon the world by the explanation of so many of the phenomena of the\r\nexternal universe by the men who had revolutionized astronomy by\r\ntheir discoveries; it was naturally hoped that that which served to\r\nexplain the great world of matter might also elucidate the little\r\nworld of man. Whewell divides the school into two parts—the Italian\r\nand the Cartesio-Newtonian sect. The Italian calculated and analysed\r\nthe properties of the animal body which are undoubtedly purely\r\nmechanical, the Cartesio-Newtonians went much further than this and\r\nintroduced many baseless hypotheses. The Italians occupied themselves\r\nwith such calculations as the force of muscles and the hydraulics of\r\nthe animal fluid. BORELLI was the first great investigator on these\r\nlines; his work _De Motu Animalium_ (Rome, 1680), treats of the forces\r\nand action of the bones and muscles. JOHN and DANIEL BERNOUELLI and\r\nHENRY PEMBERTON pursued the same line of research. The principles\r\nof hydrostatics were brought to bear on the questions of the blood\r\npressure and the breath. KEILL endeavoured to estimate the velocity\r\nof the blood. The other school occupied itself with the corpuscular\r\nhypothesis in physiology. The organs were considered as a species of\r\nsieves. Both NEWTON and DESCARTES sought to explain physiology on a\r\ntheory of round particles passing through cylindrical tubes, pyramidal\r\nones through pores of a triangular shape, cubical through square\r\nopenings. The diameter and curves of the different vessels formed\r\nsubjects of calculations, and BELLINI, DONZELLINI, and GUGLIELMINI\r\nin Italy, PERRAULT and DODART in France, COLE, KEILL, and JURIN in\r\nEngland, devoted themselves to their study.[991]\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the size and shape of the particles of the\r\nfluids, and the diameter and form of the invisible vessels, formed\r\na large part of the physiology of the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. CHEYNE thought that fevers of the acute sort arise from\r\nglandular obstruction; and MEAD, the royal physician and friend of\r\nNewton, explained the action of poisons on mechanical principles. The\r\nerror of this school, as Whewell explains, lay in considering the\r\nanimal frame as a lifeless compound of canals, cords and levers; the\r\nphysicians, to its adherents, were merely hydraulic engineers. Some\r\niatro-mathematicians were, in fact, at the same time teachers both of\r\nengineering and medicine.[992]\r\n\r\nTHE VITAL-FLUID SCHOOL. The mechanical explanation of the motions of\r\nthe animal body may satisfy some observers up to a certain point;\r\nthere, however, they must confess their theory fails them. How does\r\nmotion _originate_ in the living frame? FRIEDRICH HOFFMAN, of Halle\r\n(b. 1660), assumed a principle, material, yet of a higher kind than\r\nthe adherents of the mechanical sect were inclined to recognise. This\r\nprinciple is exceedingly subtle, and is endued with great energy. It\r\nis the ether diffused through all nature, and which has its seat in\r\nthe brain of animals and acts upon the body through the nerves. This\r\nvital fluid operates by laws which at one time were explained on the\r\nprinciples of a higher mechanics, of which we know little, and at\r\nanother on metaphysical grounds, of which we know less. Naturally\r\nthe discoveries connected with electricity imported a new element\r\ninto these speculations. The vital principle was then held to be a\r\nmodification of the electric fluid. JOHN HUNTER discerned it in the\r\nblood. CUVIER believed the vital fluid to be nervous. The objections to\r\nthe doctrine of a vital fluid “as one uniform material agent pervading\r\nthe organic frame,” are many. If the vital principle be the same in\r\nevery part of the body, how does it happen that the secretions are\r\nall so different? How does the blood under the same influence furnish\r\nall the different fluids produced by the glands? How is it the liver\r\nsecretes bile, the kidneys their peculiar fluid, the lachrymal gland\r\nthe tears? The hypothesis of a vital fluid really explains nothing.\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHICAL SCHOOL held the doctrine of an immaterial vital\r\nprinciple. This is at least as old as ARISTOTLE,[993] who attributes\r\nthe cause of motion to the soul. According to that philosopher the soul\r\nhas different parts: the _nutritive_ or _vegetative_, the _sensitive_,\r\nand the _rational_. STAHL, the great discoverer in chemistry, opposed\r\nthe physiological theories of HOFFMAN, and declared that there is\r\nsomething in living bodies which cannot be accounted for by mechanics\r\nor chemistry. “All motion,” according to him, “is a spiritual act.”\r\nNutrition and secretion belong to the operations of the soul; but he\r\noverlooked the fact that these are not peculiar to animals, but are\r\ncharacteristics of vegetables, which have no soul. CHEYNE and MEAD,\r\nPATERFIELD and WHYTT in England inclined to Stahl’s views. BOISSIER DE\r\nSAUVAGES defended them in France. HOFFMAN and afterwards HALLER opposed\r\nthem, the latter inventing the theory of Irritability.\r\n\r\nBOERHAAVE (1668-1738), professor of medicine at Leyden, was a man of\r\nvaried and profound erudition, conversant with the teaching of the\r\nancient philosophers and the Greek and Arabian physicians; he was in\r\naddition fully conversant with all the discoveries connected with\r\nthe healing art down to his own time. Beyond this he was a natural\r\nphilosopher, chemist, botanist, and anatomist, and an indefatigable\r\nexperimentalist. In teaching medicine he simplified its study as much\r\nas possible by rejecting the absurd and useless speculations which\r\nencumbered it, and putting in their place the facts which he believed\r\nhis own experience and observation had enabled him to ascertain. He\r\npublished his system of medicine in two volumes, one entitled the\r\nInstructions or Theory and the other the Aphorisms or Practice of\r\nMedicine. “These short treatises,” says Dr. Thomson,[994] “which gave\r\nto medicine a more systematic form than it had previously exhibited,\r\nare remarkable for brevity, perspicuity, and elegance of style, for\r\ngreat condensation of ideas, and for the number of important facts\r\nwhich they contain relative to the healthy and diseased states of the\r\nhuman economy.” The genius of Boerhaave raised the medical school\r\nof Leyden to the highest distinction. Princes in all countries sent\r\nhim pupils; Peter the Great took lessons in medicine from him, and\r\nso great was his reputation that when a Chinese mandarin directed a\r\nletter to him, “To the illustrious Boerhaave, physician in Europe,”\r\nit was duly delivered. He held the study of Mind to form an important\r\npart of physiology. He taught that the change produced upon the\r\nextremity of the sentient nerve must be transmitted by the nerve to\r\nthe brain before sensation can be produced. He considered the nerves\r\nto be hollow undulatory canals. He also held that each of the senses\r\nhas its distinct seat in the common sensory or brain. His lectures\r\non the mental faculties are full of varied and curious information.\r\nConsidering the human body as a combination of various machines\r\narranged in one harmonious whole, he endeavoured to explain its\r\nphenomena in health and disease on the principles of natural philosophy\r\nand chemistry to the almost entire exclusion of vital forces, which,\r\nhowever, he did not reject. He denied that all medical phenomena\r\nare to be explained upon mechanical principles. He lamented that\r\n“physiological subjects are usually handled either by mathematicians\r\nunskilful in anatomy, or by anatomists who are not versed in\r\nmathematics.” Yet his system of physiology embraced but a poor\r\nconception of the mystery of life. He says, “Let anatomy faithfully\r\ndescribe the parts and structure of the body; let the mechanician apply\r\nhis particular science to the solids; let hydrostatics explain the\r\nlaws of fluids in general, and hydraulics their actions, as they move\r\nthrough given canals; and lastly, let the chemist add to all these\r\nwhatever his art, when fairly and carefully applied, has been able to\r\ndiscover; and then, if I am not mistaken, we shall have a complete\r\naccount of medical physiology.”\r\n\r\nIt is to BOERHAAVE that we owe the peculiar chemical idea of affinity,\r\nthat mutual virtue by which one chemical substance loves, unites with,\r\nand holds the other (_amat_, _unit_, _retinet_). He called it love.\r\n“We are here to imagine, not mechanical action, not violent impulse,\r\nnot antipathy, but love, at least if love be the desire of uniting.”\r\nIt is to BOERHAAVE, therefore, we are indebted for a view of chemical\r\naffinity which enables us to comprehend all chemical changes.[995]\r\n\r\nThe idea of affinity as marriage naturally leads to analysis as\r\ndivorce. Thus affinity, imperfectly understood before the time of\r\nBoerhaave, made analysis possible. One of the first to express this\r\nconviction was DR. MAYOW, who published his Medico-Physical Tracts\r\nin 1674. He shows how an acid and an alkali lose their properties by\r\ncombination, a new substance being formed not at all resembling either\r\nof the ingredients. He explains that, “although these salts thus mixed\r\nappear to be destroyed, it is still possible for them to be separated\r\nfrom each other, with their power still entire.”[996]\r\n\r\nGEORGE ERNEST STAHL (1660-1734), chemist, was professor of medicine at\r\nHalle (1694) and physician to the King of Prussia (1716). He opposed\r\nmaterialism, and substituted “animism,” explaining the symptoms of\r\ndisease as efforts of the soul to get rid of morbid influences.\r\nStahl’s “anima” corresponds to Sydenham’s “nature” in a measure, and\r\nhas some relationship to the Archeus of Paracelsus and Van Helmont.\r\nSTAHL was the author of the “phlogiston” theory in chemistry, which\r\nin its time has had important influence on medicine. Phlogiston was a\r\nsubstance which he supposed to exist in all combustible matters, and\r\nthe escape of this principle from any compound was held to account for\r\nthe phenomenon of fire. According to STAHL, diseases arise from the\r\ndirect action of noxious powers upon the body; and from the reaction\r\nof the system itself endeavouring to oppose and counteract the effects\r\nof the noxious powers, and so preserve and repair itself.[997] He did\r\nnot consider diseases, therefore, pernicious in themselves, though he\r\nadmitted that they might become so from mistakes made by the soul in\r\nthe choice, or proportion of the motions excited to remove them, or\r\nthe time when these efforts are made. Death, according to this theory,\r\nis due to the indolence of the soul, leading it to desist from its\r\nvital motions, and refusing to continue longer the struggle against the\r\nderangements of the body.[998] Here we have the “expectant treatment”\r\nso much in vogue with many medical men. “Trusting to the constant\r\nattention and wisdom of nature,” they administered inert medicines\r\nas placebos, while they left to nature the cure of the disease. But\r\nthey neglected the use of invaluable remedies such as opium and\r\nPeruvian bark, for which error it must be admitted they atoned by\r\ndiscountenancing bleeding, vomiting, etc.[999] Stahl’s remedies were\r\nchiefly of the class known as “Antiphlogistic,” or antefebrile.\r\n\r\nDE SAUVAGES (1706-1767), the French physicist, was a disciple of Stahl,\r\nand adopted his theory of soul as the cause of the mechanical action of\r\nthe body. He invented a system of classifying diseases under the title\r\nof _Nosologia Methodica_, founded on the principles of natural history.\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH HOFFMAN (1660-1742) was a fellow-student with Stahl at Jena.\r\nHe was the author of a system of medicine in some respects original.\r\nHe distinguished in the human economy three principal agents: Nature,\r\nor the Organic Body; the Sentient Soul; and the Rational Soul;\r\ncorresponding to the classification of the Scripture of body, soul,\r\nand spirit—a classification which originated doubtless in Indian\r\nphilosophy. Hoffman did not admit with Stahl that the organic functions\r\nof the human body depend on the agency of an intelligent soul or any\r\nimmaterial agent whatsoever, but are merely mechanical and chemical\r\nproperties of the elements which compose our bodies. The functions most\r\nessential to life he considered to be the circulatory, secretory, and\r\nexcretory motions, and these seemed to him to depend upon the dilating\r\nand contracting powers of the muscular fibres of the vascular system.\r\nThese powers then he held to be the cause of the organic functions\r\nwhich depend on the animal spirits, an ethereal fluid contained in the\r\nnerves and the blood.[1000]\r\n\r\nHoffman first made known the virtues of the Seidlitz waters; he also\r\ninvented a nostrum which was popular for a long time, and called\r\n“Hoffman’s Anodyne Liquor.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\nARCHIBALD PITCAIRN, M.D. (1652-1713), was a famous physician of\r\nEdinburgh. In 1692 he occupied a professor’s chair at Leyden with\r\ngreat distinction. Among his pupils were MEAD and BOERHAAVE, who\r\nboth attributed much of their skill to his tuition. On his return to\r\nEdinburgh he greatly interested himself in improving the teaching of\r\nanatomy. He begged the Town Council to permit the dissection of the\r\nbodies of paupers; and though the chief surgeons of the place did all\r\nthey could to oppose his efforts, they were successful, and Pitcairn\r\nhad the credit of laying the foundation of the great Edinburgh school\r\nof medicine. He insisted on the strict adherence to Bacon’s method\r\nof attending to facts of experience and observation. “Nothing,” he\r\nsaid, “more hinders physic from being improved than the curiosity\r\nof searching into the natural causes of the effects of medicines.\r\nThe business of men is to know the virtues of medicines; but to\r\ninquire whence they have that power is a superfluous amusement, since\r\nnature lies concealed. A physician ought therefore to apply himself\r\nto discover by experience the effects of medicines and diseases,\r\nand reduce his observations into maxims, and not needlessly fatigue\r\nhimself by inquiring into their causes, which are neither possible nor\r\nnecessary to be known. If all physicians would act thus, we should not\r\nsee physic divided into so many sects.” In his DISSERTATIONS (1701) he\r\ndiscusses the application of geometry to physic, the circulation of the\r\nblood, the cure of fevers by purgation, and the effects of acids and\r\nalkalis in medicine. A learned and skilful physician, an accomplished\r\nmathematician, and a thorough classical scholar, he was not discreet in\r\nhis political utterances. His library was purchased by Peter the Great\r\nof Russia.\r\n\r\nJOHN RADCLIFFE, M.D. (1650-1714), was famous for “his magnificent\r\nregard for the advancement of learning and science.” The Radcliffe\r\ninfirmary and observatory at Oxford were built from funds bequeathed by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSIR HANS SLOANE, M.D. (1660-1753), was a physician whose noble museum\r\nand library were the foundation of the British Museum.\r\n\r\nSIR RICHARD BLACKMORE, M.D. (1650-1729), wrote on inoculation for\r\nsmall-pox, on consumption, gout, rheumatism, scrofula, diabetes,\r\njaundice, etc.\r\n\r\nWALTER NEEDHAM, M.D. (died 1691), made important investigations in the\r\nanatomy of the fœtus, and the changes of the pregnant uterus.\r\n\r\nCLOPTON HAVERS, M.D. (died 1702), was the author of a standard work\r\non the bones, certain canals of which were called after him Haversian\r\ncanals.\r\n\r\nJAMES DOUGLAS, M.D. (1675-1742), was an excellent anatomist, who was\r\none of the first to demonstrate from anatomy that the high operation\r\nfor stone might be safely performed. He was a skilful accoucheur, an\r\naccomplished botanist, and a man of letters. Pope mentions him in the\r\n_Dunciad_, and in a note describes him as a physician of great learning\r\nand no less taste. He wrote several works, the most famous of which is\r\n_Myographiæ Comparatæ Specimen; or a comparative description of all the\r\nmuscles in a man and in a quadruped; added is an account of the muscles\r\npeculiar to a woman_. London, 1707.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CULLEN, M.D. (1710-1790), was the first professor in Great\r\nBritain to deliver his lectures in the English language.[1001] He was\r\nappointed lecturer on chemistry at Glasgow University in 1746, and\r\nin 1751 was chosen regius professor of medicine. In 1756 he became\r\nprofessor of chemistry in the University of Edinburgh; in 1760 he was\r\nmade lecturer on materia medica. Dr. Cullen earned great distinction\r\nas a lecturer on medicine; he opposed the teaching of Boerhaave and\r\nthe principles of the humoral pathology, founding his own teaching on\r\nthat of Hoffman. His system was to a great extent based on the new\r\nphysiological doctrine of irritability as taught by Haller.\r\n\r\nHe attached great importance to nervous action in the induction of\r\ndisease, considering even gout as a neurosis.\r\n\r\nHis _First Lines of the Practice of Physic_ was long exceedingly\r\npopular, but his fame as a medical writer rests on his _Nosology_, or\r\n_Classification of Diseases_. In all his labours Dr. Cullen aimed at\r\nthe practical rather than the theoretical. “My business is not,” he\r\nremarks,[1002] “so much to explain how this and that happens, as to\r\nexamine what is truly matter of fact.” “My anxiety is not so much to\r\nfind out how it happens as to find out _what_ happens.” Cullen invented\r\nno ingenious hypothesis, rather he new-modelled the whole practice\r\nof medicine; “he defined and arranged diseases with an unrivalled\r\naccuracy, and reduced their treatment to a simplicity formerly\r\nunknown.”[1003]\r\n\r\nJAMES GREGORY, M.D. (1758-1822), exercised the greatest influence on\r\nthe progress of medicine in England. As the successor of Cullen, and as\r\nthe author of the famous _Conspectus Medicinæ Theoreticæ_, the name of\r\nGregory, borne by many ornaments of British science, became still more\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nSIR GILBERT BLANE, M.D. (born 1747), rendered important medical\r\nservices to the State by his researches on the diseases incident to\r\nseamen. He banished scurvy from the fleet by his arrangements for\r\nprovisioning ships on foreign stations, particularly by making lemon\r\njuice a regular ingredient of diet.\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM WATSON, M.D. (1715-1787), was a devoted botanist and\r\nstudent of electricity. His electrical researches raised him to a\r\nposition of European fame. He was the first in England who succeeded in\r\nigniting spirit of wine by electricity; he was the first to note the\r\ndifferent colour of the spark, as drawn from different bodies; and his\r\nresearches in the power and accumulation of electricity, the nature of\r\nits conductors, etc., qualified him to take part in the experiments\r\ncarried out in 1747 and 1748, by which the “electric current was\r\nextended to four miles in order to prove the velocity of its\r\ntransmission.”[1004] The doctor’s house in Aldersgate Street was long\r\nthe resort of the most distinguished men of science in Europe. He was\r\nnot less the benign and generous friend to the poor and suffering, than\r\nthe ardent investigator of the secrets of Nature. His work _Experiments\r\nand Observations on Electricity_ is quite a remarkable production\r\nconsidering the age in which it was published (1768).\r\n\r\nROBERT WILLAN, M.D. (1757-1812), was the founder of the science of\r\nskin diseases in England. His attention was directed in 1784 to the\r\nelementary forms of eruption, and on this basis he erected his magnum\r\nopus, _The Description and Treatment of Cutaneous Diseases_ (1798).\r\n\r\nJOHN BROWN (1735-1788), was a systematizer of medicine, whose\r\npopularity was even continental. He endeavoured to explain the\r\nprocesses of life and disease and the principles of cure upon one\r\nsimple idea, the property of “excitability.” The “exciting powers” are\r\nthe external forces, and the functions of the body are stimulants, so\r\nthat “the whole phenomena of life, health as well as disease, consist\r\nin stimulus and nothing else.” Diseases he divided as _sthenic_,\r\nattended with preternatural excitement, and _asthenic_, characterized\r\nby debility.\r\n\r\nNinety-seven per cent. of all diseases, he declared, require a\r\n“stimulating treatment.” One good result of this theory was that it\r\nintroduced a milder treatment of disease than the bleeding and purging\r\ndoctors of his time advocated. The theory was called the Brunonian, and\r\nreceived greater attention in Italy than in England.\r\n\r\nJOHN MORGAN, M.D. (1736-1789), was born in Philadelphia. He wrote an\r\nessay on his graduation at Edinburgh (1763), wherein “he maintained\r\nthat pus is a secretion from the vessels, and in this view anticipated\r\nJohn Hunter.”[1005]\r\n\r\nROBERT JAMES, M.D. (1703-1776), was the inventor of the celebrated\r\nfever-powder which bears his name.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS DE VALINGEN, M.D. (1725-1805), was a Swiss who practised in\r\nLondon. He was the first to suggest the employment of chloride of\r\narsenic in practice. His preparation was admitted into the London\r\nPharmacopœia.\r\n\r\nERASMUS DARWIN (1701-1802), a physician of Lichfield, was a true\r\npoet of science. His fame rests on the _Botanic Garden_, in which he\r\ndescribes the _Loves of the Plants_ according to the Linnæan system.\r\nHis most important scientific work is his _Zoonomia_, a pathological\r\nwork, and a treatise on generation, in which he anticipated the views\r\nof Lamarck. He asks: “Would it be too bold to imagine that in the great\r\nlength of time since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages\r\nbefore the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold\r\nto imagine that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living\r\nfilament, which the Great First Cause endued with animality, with the\r\npower of acquiring new parts, attended with new propensities, directed\r\nby irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations, and thus\r\npossessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent\r\nactivity, and of delivering down these improvements by generation to\r\nits posterity, world without end!” He believed that plants possess\r\nsensation and volition.\r\n\r\nEDWARD SPRY, M.D. (lived in 1756). At the fire of Eddystone lighthouse\r\nan old man was injured by the fall of a quantity of molten lead upon\r\nhim. Dying of his injuries in twelve days, he was examined by Dr.\r\nSpry, who stated that he found in the stomach a lump of lead three and\r\nthree-quarter inches long by one and a half in breadth. As no surgeon\r\nwould believe this story, Dr. Spry performed a number of experiments\r\nupon animals by pouring molten lead down their throats, with the result\r\nthat at the Royal Society, Dr. Huxham, in his letter to Sir William\r\nWatson, “testified to his own belief in Mr. Spry’s veracity.”[1006]\r\n\r\nJOHN COAKLEY LETTSOM, M.D. (1744-1815), was a learned and amiable\r\nphilanthropist, who published several important medical and scientific\r\nworks. His _Reflections on the Treatment and Cure of Fevers_ and\r\n_The Natural History of the Tea Tree_ appeared in 1772. He wrote the\r\nfollowing lines:—\r\n\r\n    “When patients sick to me apply,\r\n    I physics, bleeds, and sweats ’em.\r\n    Sometimes they live, sometimes they die:\r\n    What’s that to me? I. Lettsom.”\r\n\r\nHe gave away immense sums in charity, he was not so unfeeling as his\r\nverse would make him appear.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM STARK (1742-1770) was the earliest writer who distinguished\r\nbetween tuberculosis and scrofula.\r\n\r\nJEAN ASTRUC (1684-1766), professor at Montpellier, the oldest of the\r\ncelebrated French obstetricians, was the author of a work on the\r\ndiseases of women from the pathological point of view.\r\n\r\nJOHANN E. WICHMANN (1740-1802), a scientific physician of Hanover, in\r\n1786 explained the cause of itch as due to the itch-mite passing from\r\none individual to another. He experimented upon himself. BONOMO had,\r\nhowever, discovered the insect in the itch pustules in 1687.\r\n\r\nWichmann suggested the contagiousness of consumption, whooping cough,\r\ndiarrhœa, and several other complaints.\r\n\r\nJ. P. FRANK (1745-1821) was “the founder of medical police as a\r\ndistinct department of science.”[1007]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOSPITALS.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the hospitals for the sick in the eighteenth century\r\nwas scandalous almost beyond belief. Thus, in the Hôtel Dieu of Paris,\r\nthe mortality at one time was 220 per 1,000; a state of affairs which,\r\nhowever, we surpassed in the present century, when in the British\r\nhospitals at Scutari the mortality reached between 400 and 500 per\r\n1,000. In both cases this was due to overcrowding. At the Hôtel Dieu\r\ntwo or three small-pox cases, or several surgical cases, or sometimes\r\neven four lying-in women would be packed into one bed. A large\r\nproportion of the beds were purposely made for four patients, and six\r\nwere frequently crowded in.\r\n\r\nJOHN HOWARD (1726-1790), the philanthropist, by his splendid and\r\ndevoted labours in connection with the reform of prisons, hospitals,\r\nand lazarettos, drew attention to the means of preventing the\r\ncommunication of the plague and other infectious fevers. In the words\r\nof Burke “his philanthropic spirit led him to dive into the depths\r\nof dungeons; to plunge into the infection of hospitals; to survey\r\nthe mansions of sorrow and pain; to take the gauge and dimensions of\r\nmisery, depression, and contempt; to remember the forgotten; to attend\r\nto the neglected; to visit the forsaken, and to compare and collate the\r\ndistresses of all men in all countries.” Not the least of his services\r\nwere those he rendered to the cause of sanitary science and public\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nTHÉOPHILE DE BORDEU (1722-1776) was a professor of anatomy and\r\nmidwifery at Montpellier. By his great work, _Recherches sur le Pouls_,\r\nhe so enraged his professional brethren (who, like the Jews, always\r\neither maim or kill the prophets sent unto them), that he was attacked\r\nin his personal character with disgraceful malignity for several years.\r\nHe rendered very great services to the progress of medical science. His\r\nphysiology was far in advance of his age, and many men have found in\r\nhis researches on the functions of the glands a mine of wealth for the\r\nestablishment of their own reputation.\r\n\r\nM. F. X. DE BICHAT (1771-1802) was a celebrated French anatomist and\r\nphysiologist, whose great work, _Anatomie Générale_, was the foundation\r\nof the reform of French medicine at the intellectual awakening after\r\nthe great revolution. Pathology, the science of disease, would have\r\nbeen impossible without such researches as those of Bichat. He first\r\ntook a “commanding view,” not merely of the organs of the body, but of\r\nthe tissues of which they are built up. He resolved the complex into\r\nits elements, and investigated the structure of each. He completed the\r\noverthrow of the iatro-mathematical school, regarding the properties of\r\nthe _living_ tissues as _vital_ actions. He classified the functions\r\nas _organic_ and _animal_, and greatly aided in systematising the\r\nphenomena of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nMESMERISM.\r\n\r\nFREDERICK ANTON MESMER (1733-1815) studied medicine at Vienna. He\r\nembraced astrology, and believed in the influence of the stars on\r\nliving beings. He came to think that cures might be effected by\r\nstroking with magnets; afterwards he discarded the magnets, and\r\nconvinced himself that he could influence others by stroking them\r\nwith his hands alone. In 1778 Paris was greatly excited over the\r\nmiraculous cures of mesmerism. The medical faculty denounced him as a\r\ncharlatan, though a Government Commission in its report admitted many\r\nof the facts, while tracing them to physiological causes. The Marquis\r\nde Puysegur revolutionised the art of mesmerism by producing all the\r\nphenomena without the mummeries and violent means resorted to by\r\nMesmer. Dr. John Elliotson in England in 1830 successfully practised\r\nthe art.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 BARON VON REICHENBACH declared he had discovered a new force\r\nwhich he called _odyl_, and in 1850 his _Researches on Magnetism_ were\r\ntranslated into English by Dr. Gregory, professor of chemistry in the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nG. VAN SWIETEN (1700-1772) was a pupil of Boerhaave, and famous in\r\nthe history of medicine as the founder of the Old Vienna School. He\r\nbrought about the clinical teaching for which that school has since\r\nbeen so famous. Following the instructions of Paracelsus, he introduced\r\ninto his practice the use of mercuric perchloride internally in the\r\ntreatment of syphilis. His commentaries on Boerhaave were considered to\r\nbe more valuable than the text itself.\r\n\r\nDE HAEN (1704-1776), of the Hague, studied under Boerhaave, and having\r\nbeen recommended by Van Swieten, was invited to Vienna as president\r\nof the clinical school in the hospital of that city. Observation, and\r\nthe simplest treatment in disease, especially in fevers, made up the\r\nchief part of his medical system. Purgatives and emetics and powerful\r\nmedicines he would use only on the most urgent necessity. Hygiene, both\r\nfor the patient and the state, he considered of the highest importance\r\nin medical education. Clinical thermometry received great attention\r\nfrom De Haen, who demonstrated that in what is considered by the\r\npatient the cold stage of fevers there is really a notable increase in\r\nthe temperature.\r\n\r\nJAMES YONGE (1646-1721), physician and F.R.S., wrote an important\r\ntreatise on the use of turpentine as a means of arresting hæmorrhage,\r\nentitled _Currus Triumphalis de Terebintho_. He described the flap\r\noperation in amputations, and was acquainted with the principle of the\r\ntourniquet for the arrest of bleeding during operations.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADDENBROOKE, M.D., died 1719, leaving by his will four thousand\r\npounds to found a hospital at Cambridge, which now bears his name.\r\n\r\nJAMES DRAKE, M.D. (1667-1707), wrote a work, once deservedly popular,\r\nentitled _Anthropologia Nova; or, a New System of Anatomy_.\r\n\r\nJOHN ARBUTHNOT, M.D. (1658-1735), physician to Queen Anne, was a man of\r\nextensive learning and of great scientific abilities, characterized by\r\nThackeray as “one of the wisest, wittiest, most accomplished, gentlest\r\nof mankind.”\r\n\r\nDANIEL TURNER, M.D. (1667-1741), achieved a certain fame as the\r\ninventor of an excellent ointment, still known as “Turner’s Cerate,”\r\ncomposed of oil, wax, and calamine.\r\n\r\nRICHARD MEAD, M.D. (1673-1754), was the author of the _Mechanical\r\nAccount of Poisons_, a work which at once established his reputation.\r\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1703. On the accession\r\nof George II. he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the King.\r\nHe was the friend of Radcliffe, and like him a generous promoter of\r\nscience and learning and of unbounded charity to those in misery. It\r\nwas Mead who persuaded Guy to bequeath his fortune to found the noble\r\nhospital which bears his name. Mead was a political physician, and it\r\nis said by Miss Strickland that his prompt boldness occasioned the\r\npeaceable proclamation of George I. Mead’s work on the diseases of the\r\nBible, entitled _Medica Sacra_, is a curious and interesting treatise.\r\nExcellent physician as he was, he recommended pepper and lichen as a\r\nspecific against the bite of a mad dog.\r\n\r\nJOHN FREIND, M.D. (1675-1728), a learned and accomplished physician,\r\nis famous as the author of an elaborate work, _The History of Physick\r\nfrom the Time of Galen to the Beginning of the Sixteenth Century_. He\r\nlaid the plan of this important work whilst a prisoner in the Tower, to\r\nwhich he was committed on suspicion of participation in the so-called\r\n“Bishop’s plot.” He was liberated after about three months’ confinement\r\nby the firmness of Dr. Mead, who refused to prescribe for Sir Robert\r\nWalpole till he consented to admit him to bail.[1008] During his\r\nimprisonment Freind wrote a Latin letter _On certain Kinds of Small\r\nPox_.\r\n\r\nHow near the physicians of Mead’s time came towards the discovery of\r\nthe germ theory of infectious disorders may be seen from his account\r\nof the leprosy.[1009] In this treatise he says it has been found by\r\nexperiments that in the plague and other malignant eruptive fevers the\r\ninfection once received into articles of clothing remains in them for\r\na long time, and thence passes into human bodies, and “like seeds sown\r\nproduces the disease peculiar to them.” With reference to the retention\r\nof the infection by dry walls, he says, “I thought it probable that\r\nthey may, by a kind of fermentation, produce these hollow, greenish, or\r\nreddish strokes,” etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURGEONS.\r\n\r\nDOMINIQUE ANEL (1679-1730) was the famous French surgeon who invented\r\nthe operation for aneurism, which Hunter afterwards modified and called\r\nby his own name.\r\n\r\nHe successfully treated lachrymal fistula, and invented several\r\nsurgical instruments which are named after him.\r\n\r\nJ. L. PETIT (1674-1750) in 1718 invented the screw tourniquet for\r\ncompressing bleeding arteries. He was one of the most famous surgeons\r\nin the brightest period of the art in France, and was besides an\r\nexcellent ophthalmologist.\r\n\r\nLE CAT (1700-1768) was the famous lithotomist, and opponent of the\r\ndoctrines of Haller.\r\n\r\nLE DRAN (1685-1770) performed the first disarticulation of the thigh.\r\n\r\nMORAND (1697-1773) performed disarticulation of the upper arm.\r\n\r\nPIERRE JOSEPH DESAULT (1744-1795) was a great French anatomist and\r\nsurgeon, who instituted a clinical school of surgery at the Hôtel Dieu\r\nin Paris. He frequently had an audience of six hundred.\r\n\r\nHe introduced many improvements in surgical practice and in the\r\nconstruction of surgical instruments.\r\n\r\nG. DE LA FAYE (d. 1781), a great surgeon and oculist, also\r\ndisarticulated the shoulder joint.\r\n\r\nA. LOUIS (1723-1792) was a distinguished military surgeon.\r\n\r\nR. B. SABATIER (1723-1811) was a distinguished surgeon, anatomist,\r\nand ophthalmologist, and a man of great and all-round information on\r\nmedical subjects in general.\r\n\r\nP. F. PERCY (1754-1825) was a military surgeon who introduced\r\ncold-water dressings into French surgery.\r\n\r\nANTONIO SCARPA (1748-1832), the famous Italian anatomist, held the\r\nchair of anatomy at Modena, was distinguished in every branch of\r\nanatomical research, and investigated the minute anatomy of the nerves\r\nand bones. He decided the long-debated question whether the heart is\r\nsupplied with nerves in the affirmative. He wrote on diseases of the\r\neye, on aneurism, and on hernia. He was an elegant scholar, “equally at\r\nhome in the criticism of the fine arts and in the details of scientific\r\nagriculture.”\r\n\r\nAmongst the principal Italian surgeons of the century were BERTRANDI\r\n(1723-1797), TROJA (1747-1827), and PALLETTA (1747-1823).\r\n\r\nOf the Germans the great names are, SCHMUCKER (1712-1786), RICHTER\r\n(1742-1812), and SIEBOLD (1736-1807), who first taught surgery\r\nclinically in Germany.\r\n\r\nCALLISEN (1740-1824), the great Danish surgeon, and ANEL (1741-1801),\r\nthe founder of the Swedish School of Surgery, are two famous names\r\nwhich must be remembered in the surgical history of the period.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CHESELDEN (1688-1752) was famous as a lithotomist and oculist.\r\nHis dexterity in the performance of lithotomy caused marvellous legends\r\nto be told of him, it was even said that he had operated in fifty-four\r\nseconds. He published his _Anatomy of the Human Body_ in 1713.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL SHARP (1700-1778) excelled in nearly every branch of surgery,\r\nand was a skilful operator, who by his efforts to stimulate English\r\nsurgeons to emulate the French did much to advance British surgery.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN GOOCH of Norwich, HEY of Leeds, and PARK of Liverpool, were\r\nalso famous in this period.\r\n\r\nPERCIVAL POTT (1713-1788) was a surgeon to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital,\r\nLondon, whose life formed a sort of epoch in the history of surgery in\r\nEngland. Samuel Cooper says of him[1010] that he was in his time the\r\nbest practical surgeon, the best lecturer, the best writer on surgery,\r\nthe best operator of which the metropolis could boast.\r\n\r\nJOHN HUNTER (1728-1793) was a physiologist and surgeon combined,\r\nunrivalled in the annals of medicine. He raised surgery, which before\r\nhis time was little more than a mechanical art, to the rank of a\r\nscientific profession. As a pathologist and comparative anatomist, he\r\nrendered the greatest services to medicine and surgery. He dissected\r\n500 different species of animals. One of the most brilliant surgical\r\ndiscoveries of the century was Hunter’s operation for the cure of\r\npopliteal aneurism, by tying the femoral artery above the tumour and\r\nwithout interfering with it. He improved the treatment of rupture of\r\nthe tendo achillis, and invented a method of curing lachrymal fistula,\r\nand of curing hydrocele radically by injection.\r\n\r\nHe was the first to describe phlebitis (inflammation of the veins), and\r\nhe made the discovery that the white blood corpuscles are antecedent\r\nto the red. He investigated the subject of inflammation, the results\r\nof which he published in his _Treatise on the Blood, Inflammation\r\nand Gun-shot Wounds_. Other works of Hunter’s are his _Treatise on\r\nthe Natural History of the Human Teeth_, _A Treatise on the Venereal\r\nDisease_, and _Observations on Certain Points of the Animal Economy_.\r\n“His greatest monument is the splendid museum which he formed by his\r\nsole efforts, which he made too when labouring under every disadvantage\r\nof deficient education and limited means.” His brother-in-law, Sir\r\nEverard Home, prepared the catalogue of the museum and then burned\r\nHunter’s manuscripts, probably that he might conceal the plagiarisms of\r\nwhich he had been guilty in writing his book on Comparative Anatomy.\r\nThe Government purchased Hunter’s museum from his widow for £15,000,\r\nupon condition that twenty-four lectures should be delivered every year\r\nto members of the college, and that the museum should be open to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nCHARLES WHITE, a Manchester surgeon (_circ._ 1768), was the first\r\nto introduce what is known as conservative surgery. He first\r\nresected[1011] the humerus, and taught the reduction of shoulder\r\ndislocations with the heel in the arm-pit.\r\n\r\nThe German surgeons in the seventeenth century held simply the position\r\nof barbers; they began life by cutting hair, shaving, cupping and\r\nbleeding, and then rose to be dressers of wounds and ulcers, and to\r\ntreat fractures and dislocations.[1012] In 1713, Berlin acquired its\r\nfirst anatomical theatre for the instruction of military doctors and\r\n“medico-surgeons.” Dresden and Hanover began to improve the education\r\nof clever barbers about the middle of the eighteenth century. The\r\nMilitary Medical School of Vienna was opened in 1781. Barbers and\r\nbathmen in the eighteenth century were trained into district medical\r\nofficers and surgeons by a course of instruction lasting from two\r\nto three years. In Holland students were privileged to assist in\r\noperations at the hospitals. The first surgical clinic in Germany was\r\nestablished at Würzburg, in 1769. The Vienna surgical clinic arose in\r\n1774. The greatest teacher of surgery in Germany, A. G. Richter, gave\r\nclinical instruction at Göttingen, in 1781.[1013]\r\n\r\nG. M. THILENIUS in 1784 performed the first division of the _tendo\r\nachillis_ for the cure of club-foot.\r\n\r\nJUSTUS ARNEMAN (1763-1807) was a surgical professor at Göttingen, who\r\nwrote a system of surgery and advanced the study of diseases of the ear.\r\n\r\nCAMPER (1722-1789), a Dutch surgeon of a mechanical turn of mind, made\r\nimprovements in trusses. LEGUIN, a Frenchman, was the first to employ\r\nsteel springs in trusses (1663). TIPHARIE in 1761 introduced the double\r\ntruss.[1014]\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSTETRICIANS.\r\n\r\nJOHANN PALFYN (1649-1730), a celebrated obstetric physician, in 1721\r\ninvented, or rather re-introduced, a species of forceps in difficult\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nHUGH CHAMBERLEN, M.D. (1664-1728), was the most famous man-midwife\r\nof his day. His name is for ever associated with the invention of\r\nthe obstetric forceps—a noble instrument, which has saved more lives\r\nthan any mechanical invention ever associated with the healing art. A\r\nmonument was erected to his memory in Westminster Abbey, with a long\r\nLatin epitaph by Bishop Atterbury.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SMELLIE (1680-1763), a distinguished English obstetric\r\nphysician, improved the midwifery forceps and suggested and performed\r\nvarious operations in obstetric practice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BROMFIELD (1712-1792) founded the Lock Hospital, London. He\r\ninvented a tenaculum (a fine sharp hook by which the mouths of bleeding\r\narteries are drawn out). He was a celebrated operator, and wrote a work\r\non surgery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Medical College of Philadelphia was the first institution\r\nestablished in North America to give medical instruction. It was\r\norganized in May, 1765, by Drs. Shippen and Morgan. The University\r\nof Pennsylvania developed its medical department from this humble\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMISTS, PHYSIOLOGISTS, BOTANISTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER MONRO (1697-1767) was a very eminent surgeon and anatomist of\r\nEdinburgh, whose Medical School owes more to him probably than to any\r\nother individual. He wrote on the _Anatomy of the Bones_, and an _Essay\r\non Comparative Anatomy_.\r\n\r\nFRANK NICHOLLS, M.D. (1699-1778), was a famous anatomist and\r\nphysiologist at Oxford. “He was the inventor of corroded anatomical\r\npreparations, and one of the first to study and teach the minute\r\nanatomy of tissues, in other words, general, as distinguished from\r\nregional and descriptive anatomy.”[1015] He was one of the first to\r\ndescribe correctly the mode of the production of aneurism, and he\r\ndistinctly recognised the existence and function of the vaso-motor\r\nnerves.[1016]\r\n\r\nBROWNE LANGRISH, M.D., was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in\r\n1734. He was the author of several medical treatises, one of which\r\nwas entitled _Physical Experiments upon Brutes to discover a Method\r\nof dissolving Stone in the Bladder by Injections; to which is added a\r\ncourse of Experiments with the Lauro-Cerasus; on Fumes of Sulphur_,\r\netc. 8vo. Lond., 1746. His researches on the action of cherry\r\nlaurel water are said to have suggested the use of prussic acid in\r\nmedicine.[1017]\r\n\r\nJOHN FOTHERGILL, M.D. (1712-1780), was a distinguished botanist, who\r\ncollected a great number of rare plants from all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CRUIKSHANK (1745-1800) was an anatomist who discovered urea.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN HALES (1677-1761), an experimental physiologist and\r\npathologist, produced dropsy by injecting water into the veins of\r\nanimals, and investigated by experiments on animals the relative\r\nmovements of the blood.\r\n\r\nANTONIO VALSALVA (1666-1723), a great Italian anatomist, held the\r\nprofessor’s chair at Bologna and wrote a valuable treatise upon the ear\r\nand its anatomy.\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI SANTORINI (1681-1737) was a Venetian anatomist whose\r\ninvestigations in the anatomy of the larynx, nose, face, etc., have\r\nimmortalised his name in connection with several structures of those\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI B. MORGAGNI (1682-1772) was the great founder of pathological\r\nanatomy. He was a pupil of Valsalva. His famous book on pathological\r\nanatomy was not published until he was in his 79th year. He was the\r\nauthor of the maxim that “observations should be weighed, not counted.”\r\nThe researches in morbid anatomy carried out by Morgagni formed an\r\nepoch in the history of modern medicine, which may indeed be said to\r\nrest on the two methods of Sydenham and Morgagni. The work of the\r\nItalian anatomist was complementary to that of the English Hippocrates,\r\nwho neglected anatomy. Morgagni and the “Encyclopædic Haller,” whom we\r\nare next to consider, were two of the brightest medical lights of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nALBERT VON HALLER (1708-1777), surnamed “the Great,” was a Swiss\r\nphysician of Berne, who was not only a distinguished scientist, but a\r\nman of letters and a famous poet. He studied comparative anatomy at\r\nTübingen; in 1725 he removed to Leyden, which at that time was the\r\nfirst medical school in Europe. He visited England in 1727, and made\r\nthe acquaintance of Sir Hans Sloane, Cheselden, Dr. James Douglas, and\r\nother eminent persons. Leaving London, he went to Paris, but having\r\nbeen detected by the police in dissecting in his lodgings, he had to\r\nleave France, and he went to Basle to continue his investigations\r\nin anatomy; there he studied mathematics under John Bernoulli, and,\r\nhaving imbibed a taste for botany, studied the flora of Switzerland,\r\non which he afterwards published a work. In 1729 he returned to Berne\r\nand lectured on anatomy; invited in 1726 to accept the professorship\r\nof anatomy, surgery, and botany in the newly founded University of\r\nGöttingen, he removed to that city, and by his influence a botanical\r\ngarden, an anatomical theatre, a school of surgery and midwifery were\r\nestablished there. In 1747 he published his most valuable work, the\r\n_Primæ Lineæ Physiologiæ_ which was used as a text-book in medical\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nVAN SWIETEN (1700-1772), the pupil of Boerhaave, established the first\r\nclinical institution in Germany. He was with Sanchez the first to use\r\ncorrosive sublimate in medicine. To his exertions it was due that the\r\nteaching of medicine was greatly improved in Austria.\r\n\r\nJ. F. MECKEL (1724-1774) was an anatomist whose researches on the\r\nnerves, blood-vessels, glands, etc., have greatly contributed to our\r\nknowledge of their physiological functions.\r\n\r\nJ. C. PEYER (1653-1712) and J. C. BRUNER (1653-1727) discovered the\r\nglands in the intestines which are known to this day by their names.\r\n\r\nA. PACCHIONI (1665-1726) described the glands we call in his honour\r\n“Pacchionian.” W. COWPER (1666-1709) discovered those which bear his\r\nname. M. NABOTH (1675-1721) described the structures we call ovula\r\nNabothi. H. MEIBOM (1638-1700) discovered the glands of the eyelids\r\nnamed after him.\r\n\r\nWALTER CHARLTON, M.D. (1619-1707), anatomist, a voluminous writer, was\r\nto some extent a follower of Van Helmont.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS FULLER, M.D. (died 1734), published several pharmacopœias and an\r\naccount of eruptive fevers, with several other works.\r\n\r\nNEHEMIAH GREW, M.D. (born about 1641), wrote _The Anatomy of Plants,\r\nwith an Idea of a Philosophical History of Plants_, which Sprengel\r\ncalls _opus absolutum et immortale_. Hallam says,[1018] “no man,\r\nperhaps, who created a science has carried it further than Grew; few\r\ndiscoveries of great importance have been made in the mere anatomy of\r\nplants since his time.” His great discovery was the sexual system of\r\nplants; “that the sexual system is universal in the vegetable kingdom,\r\nand that the dust of the antheræ is endowed with an impregnating\r\npower.”[1019]\r\n\r\nHe was the first to obtain sulphate of magnesia from the Epsom waters,\r\nand to investigate its properties. His treatise on Epsom salts was\r\npublished in 1697.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BRIGGS, M.D. (died 1704), was famous for his “skill in\r\ndifficult cases of the eye.”\r\n\r\nEDWARD TYSON, M.D. (died 1708), wrote on anatomy; he was the Carus of\r\nGarth’s _Dispensary_, and the discoverer of “Tyson’s Glands.”\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PITCAIRN, M.D. (1711-1791), was an accomplished botanist. He\r\nlived in the Upper Street, Islington, where he had a botanical garden\r\nfive acres in extent, stocked with the scarcest and most valuable\r\nplants. He introduced into St. Bartholomew’s Hospital a much freer use\r\nof opium in the treatment of disease, and especially of fevers, than\r\nhad hitherto been customary, and that with the greatest benefit to the\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nPETER SHAW, M.D. (1694-1763), greatly facilitated the study of\r\nchemistry in England by his translations of the chemical works of\r\nStahl and Boerhaave, as well as by his own works. He edited the works\r\nof Bacon and Boyle, and published a number of books on medicine and\r\nchemistry.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HUNTER, M.D. (1718-1783), was an earnest and devoted anatomist\r\nand obstetrician. He was a pupil of Cullen, and was so successful a\r\npractitioner that he expended £100,000 upon his house and anatomical\r\ncollection, etc. The Hunterian Museum of the University of Glasgow was\r\nformed from this collection. The famous John Hunter was his younger\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS DIMSDALE, M.D. (1711-1800), a celebrated promoter of inoculation\r\nfor small-pox, acquired a great reputation and immense wealth by the\r\nprocess. Catherine II. of Russia paid him enormous sums for successful\r\ninoculations, and gave him a barony.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HEBERDEN, M.D. (1710-1801), lectured on Materia Medica at\r\nCambridge. Dr. Munk[1020] gives an interesting extract from one of\r\nHeberden’s lectures on Mithridatum and Theriaca, the famous classic\r\nmedicines; he proves that the only poisons known to the ancients were\r\nhemlock, monk’s-hood, and those of venomous beasts, and that they had\r\nno antidotes for these. He says that the first accounts of powerful\r\npoisons concealed in seals or rings, poisonous vapours in gloves and\r\nletters, etc., are idle inventions of ignorant and superstitious\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nBUFFON (1707-1788) was the celebrated French naturalist to whom “we owe\r\nour first clear and practical connection of the distribution of animals\r\nwith the geography of the globe.”\r\n\r\nGEORGE ARMSTRONG in 1769 opened the first children’s hospital in\r\nEurope; he was the physician who first devoted special attention to the\r\ndiseases of children. Armstrong was a London man, and died 1781.\r\n\r\nJOH. E. GREDRING (1718-1775) was a German physician who was the first\r\nto investigate “the seat, cause, and diagnosis of insanity.”[1021]\r\n\r\nJAMES CURRIE (1756-1805) advocated the cold-water treatment of typhus\r\nfever patients, and thus introduced a method of treatment which\r\nin one form or another is used at the present time for reducing\r\nthe temperature of the body in such cases. Currie determined the\r\ntemperature by the thermometer.\r\n\r\nLADY WORTLEY MONTAGU (1690-1762) is famous in the annals of medicine\r\nfor her courageous adoption of the Turkish practice of inoculation\r\nfor small-pox in the case of her own son. By her zealous advocacy\r\nshe was instrumental in causing the practice to be introduced into\r\nEngland in 1721. Dr. Keith having subjected his son to the operation,\r\nexperiments were conducted upon criminals by Maitland, and these\r\nhaving been successful, the Prince of Wales and the royal princesses\r\nwere inoculated by Mead. On behalf of the Almighty, whose province was\r\nsupposed to be trespassed upon by these and similar proceedings, the\r\npractice was violently opposed by the clergy and others.\r\n\r\nEDWARD JENNER (1749-1823) introduced the practice of vaccination as a\r\npreventive of small-pox. He commenced his investigations concerning\r\ncow-pox about the year 1776. The practice of inoculation with the\r\nvirus of small-pox, which had been introduced into England through\r\nthe suggestion of Lady Wortley Montagu, indirectly led Jenner to his\r\ngrand discovery. His attention was excited by finding that certain\r\npersons to whom he attempted to communicate small-pox by inoculation\r\nwere not susceptible to the disease; on pursuing his inquiries he found\r\nthat these persons had undergone cow-pox—a complaint common among the\r\ndairy-servants and farmers in Gloucestershire, and that these people\r\nwere aware that cow-pox in some way was a preventive against the\r\nsmall-pox. Local medical men had long been acquainted with this idea,\r\nbut had paid no attention to it, considering it merely a popular and\r\ngroundless belief. Jenner’s genius, however, led him to divine the\r\ntruth of the matter and turn it to practical advantage. The disease\r\nwhich affects the udder of the cow was found to be inoculable in the\r\nhuman subject, and could be propagated from one person to another,\r\nrendering those who had passed through the complaint secure from an\r\nattack of small-pox. Having confided the fact of this discovery to some\r\nmedical friends, it was taken up in 1796 by Mr. Clive, of St. Thomas’s\r\nHospital, who introduced vaccination into London. Vaccination was\r\nadopted in the army and navy, and Jenner was honoured by professional\r\ndistinctions and a parliamentary grant of £20,000. He was made a Fellow\r\nof the Royal Society, and his fame and the benefits of his discovery\r\nwere rapidly extended to continental nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK VI.\r\n\r\n                         _THE AGE OF SCIENCE._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE NINTEENTH CENTURY.—PHYSICAL SCIENCE ALLIED TO MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n Exit the Disease-Demon.—Medical Systems again.—Homœopathy.—The\r\n Natural Sciences.—Chemistry, Electricity, Physiology, Anatomy,\r\n Medicine and Pathology.—Psychiatry.—Surgery.—Ophthalmology.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the dawn of modern science was sounded the death-knell of the\r\ndisease-demon and its twin brother “Visitation.” When the French\r\nRevolution, having at first intoxicated men, had had time to effect\r\nits really beneficent aims, the age of modern science was fairly\r\ninaugurated, and daily conferred some fresh blessing on the race.\r\nThe beginning of the nineteenth century saw the steam engine rapidly\r\napproaching perfection. In 1801 took place the first experiment with\r\nsteam navigation on the Thames. In 1814 steam was first applied to\r\nprinting in the _Times_ office. In 1829 locomotive steam-carriages were\r\nemployed on railways at Liverpool. In the early years of the century\r\nthe electric telegraph was being developed. Machinery began to take\r\nthe place of hand labour in numberless branches of trade and industry.\r\nNobler than these material blessings, however, was the awakening of\r\nthe English people to a new and higher humanity. It seemed that as\r\nScience began to shower her gifts on our nation, it yearned to become\r\nthe almoner of mankind, and in its turn to bless the world with the\r\nprecious gifts of freedom, education, improved sanitation, and the\r\nmeans of developing the dormant higher powers of the species. The slave\r\ntrade of England was abolished by Parliament in 1807. In 1834 the\r\nEnglish government began to make annual grants in aid of education.\r\nSanitary commissions were appointed in 1838 and 1844, which were of\r\nincalculable benefit, not only to our own national health, but in\r\nsuggesting to other countries the means of improving the health and\r\ncombating the ravages of preventable diseases. In the early years\r\nof the century Dr. Birkbeck founded Mechanics’ Institutions, thus\r\ncommencing the era of enlightenment for the working classes, which\r\nhas resulted in raising the mental condition of our labouring and\r\nlower middle classes to a higher level than that of any other nation\r\nof the old world. Everywhere schools sprung up, books and newspapers\r\nwere multiplied, until everybody who could read had mental provender\r\nprovided at a merely nominal rate.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the history of medicine, the science of the century\r\nhas perhaps on the whole done greater service to the healing art\r\nby that which it has taught doctors to leave undone than by what\r\nit has taught them to do. It has arrested the murderous lancet of\r\nthe blood-letter; it has stayed the hand of the purger, who merely\r\nbled in another manner; it has rescued the unhappy victims of mental\r\ndisorders from their dungeons, their beds of straw, and the cruel lash\r\nof their keepers; it has liberated the invalid from the tyranny of the\r\nmedicine-monger; it is no longer possible to force down any patient’s\r\nthroat such a mass of filthy concoctions as the following items of\r\nmedicine enumerated in an apothecary’s bill for attending one Mr.\r\nDalby, of Ludgate Hill, which in five days amounted to £17 2_s._ 10_d._\r\n\r\nThe items for _one day_ (August 12) are:—\r\n\r\n                                 _s._ _d._\r\n  An emulsion                     4    6\r\n  A mucilage                      3    4\r\n  Jelly of hawthorn               4    0\r\n  Plaster to dress blister        1    0\r\n  A clyster                       2    6\r\n  An ivory pipe                   1    0\r\n  A cordial bolus                 2    6\r\n  The same again                  2    6\r\n  A cordial draught               2    4\r\n  The same again                  2    4\r\n  Another bolus                   2    6\r\n  Another draught                 2    4\r\n  A glass of cordial spirits      3    6\r\n  Blister to the arm              5    0\r\n  The same to the wrists          5    0\r\n  Two boluses again               5    0\r\n  Two draughts again              4    8\r\n  Another emulsion                4    6\r\n  Another pearl julep             4    6\r\n\r\nThis is quoted in the _Historical Sketch of the Progress of Pharmacy\r\nin Great Britain_,[1022] p. 17, not as an isolated case, but as an\r\nillustration of the practice of apothecaries when attending patients of\r\nthe higher classes.\r\n\r\nHomœopathy did much to remedy this state of affairs, and by deluding\r\npeople into believing that the billionth of a grain of a certain drug\r\nskilfully manipulated was more effectual than the bolus and decoction\r\nof the medicine-monger, tended gradually to destroy the popular faith\r\nin the dosing system.\r\n\r\nThe student of medical history is often reminded forcibly of Tennyson’s\r\nlines:—\r\n\r\n    “Our little systems have their day;\r\n    They have their day, and cease to be.”\r\n\r\nAs he reflects on the many schools, sects, and systems which have\r\ndominated the practice of physic, he will often, as he passes them in\r\nreview one by one, ask mournfully with Hans Breitmann:—\r\n\r\n                      “Vhere ish dot barty now?”\r\n\r\nWhere now is the Iatro-mathematical School, the party of the\r\nIatro-chemists, the Brunonian sect? One and all vanished into the\r\nEwigkeit!\r\n\r\nTo have maintained, in the zenith of their fame, that either of the\r\ngreat medical schools could ever have so completely perished would\r\nhave been the rankest heresy; to believe now that the germ theory of\r\ndisease can ever be superseded is to be subjected to the charge, not of\r\nmedical heresy alone, but of the completest ignorance of science. Yet\r\nthere are some bold spirits who have dared even this. The history of\r\nthe past forbids the cautious historian of medicine to make too sure of\r\nthe permanence of any theory of disease or system of cure, but the germ\r\ntheory has claims to our acceptance which far outweigh those of any\r\nother theories which we have reviewed. From the length of time it has\r\nbeen under construction, from the marvellous care and minute caution\r\nexercised by the profound scientists who have devoted their lives and\r\nutmost energies to the innumerable experiments which their researches\r\nhave embraced, from the fact that not medical theorists merely, but\r\nsober-minded scientists as well as practical surgeons and physicians,\r\nhave everywhere given their adherence to the germ theory of disease, we\r\nhave good reason to believe that it will hold its ground as a theory of\r\nthe cause—if not of much value as a system of cure—of a great number of\r\nthe most serious maladies which afflict the races of men and animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL SYSTEMS.\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI RASORI (1762-1837), of Milan, introduced a theory which was a\r\nrevival of Methodism combined with that of Brunonianism. The Methodists\r\nheld a status strictus and a status laxus, Brown a sthenic diathesis\r\nand an asthenic diathesis.\r\n\r\nRasori taught a combination of these theories modified by his own. His\r\ndoctrines were accepted by a multitude of learned and eminent medical\r\nmen, yet his teaching was simply atrocious, and a study of it almost\r\nmakes one despair of any real advance for the healing art. His system\r\nof therapeutics consisted in the endeavour to make a diagnosis of the\r\ndisease by watching the effects of the remedies which make it better or\r\nworse! Bleeding was held to be the best diagnostic means: if it did the\r\npatient good, the sthenic diathesis was assumed; if it made him worse,\r\nthe asthenic was demonstrated.\r\n\r\nHe administered enormous doses of powerful drugs, such as would be\r\nconsidered nothing less than simply poisonous now. Baas says he gave 1\r\nto 4 grammes of gamboge for diarrhœa, and 60 to 90 grammes of saltpetre\r\na day[1023]—doses which would be large for a horse.\r\n\r\nThe wonder is that anybody survived the treatment.\r\n\r\nHomœopathy, faith-healing, peculiar-people treatment, anything,\r\nhowever heterodox, is better than this licensed system of murder,\r\nwhich actually received the adhesion of famous professors at Italian\r\nuniversities, where the art of medicine was supposed to be taught sixty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nJOHANN A. ROESCHLAUB (1768-1835), a highly cultivated German physician,\r\nwas the founder of a medical system on the “Theory of Excitement.” Life\r\ndepends upon irritability which belongs to the natural disposition.\r\nTo be healthy, the body must be in a state of moderate irritation and\r\nmoderate excitability. Disease disturbs the happy medium upwards as\r\nhypersthenia, or downwards as asthenia; in other words, by inducing too\r\nmuch strength or actual debility.\r\n\r\nJOHANN STIEGLITZ (1767-1840) was an eminent physician who opposed\r\nthe theory of excitement, saying, “There is no such thing as one\r\nonly saving system.” He was the founder of Etiological diagnosis (or\r\ndiagnosis dependent on a knowledge of the causes of disease).\r\n\r\nC. W. VON HUFELAND (1762-1836), professor at Jena, and afterwards in\r\nBerlin, opposed the theory of excitement. He used to say, “Successful\r\ntreatment requires only one-third science and two-thirds _savoir\r\nfaire_,” and, “To him who fails to make a religion of the healing art,\r\nit is the most cheerless, wearisome, and thankless art upon earth;\r\nindeed, in him it must become the greatest frivolity and a sin.”\r\n\r\nF. J. W. BROUSSAIS (1772-1838), a physician of the vitalist school,\r\nwas a devoted follower of Bichat, who made it his chief aim to find an\r\nanatomical basis for all diseases. He is particularly known for his\r\ntheory that all fevers arise from irritation or inflammation of the\r\nintestinal canal. His long-exploded theory led to an enormous misuse\r\nof bleeding. He christened his system “Physiological Medicine,” which\r\nby directing attention to the morbid changes in the organs, led to the\r\nrise of the pathological school of Corvisart, Laënnec, and Bayle. The\r\nsystems of Brown and Broussais must have destroyed, says Dr. De Noé\r\nWalker, more human beings than the whole revolutionary wars from 1793\r\nto 1815.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL C. F. HAHNEMANN (1755-1843), the founder of Homœopathy, was\r\nborn at Meissen, near Dresden. He studied medicine at Leipsic, and\r\nafterwards at Vienna, graduating at Erlangen in 1779. In his first\r\nmedical treatise he takes a despondent view of medical practice in\r\ngeneral, and of his own in particular, as he is candid enough to own\r\nthat most of his patients would have done better had they been let\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Hufeland upon the necessity of a regeneration in\r\nmedicine (1808), he declares that after eight years’ practice he had so\r\nlearned the delusive nature of the ordinary methods of treatment as to\r\nbe compelled to relinquish practice. He devoted much attention to the\r\nscience of chemistry.\r\n\r\nBerzelius said of him, “That man would have been a great chemist had\r\nhe not been a great quack.” He translated Cullen’s _Materia Medica_ in\r\n1790, and the necessary study of medicinal agents which this involved\r\nset him thinking of a new theory of disease and cure which should\r\nreplace that which he had found so unsatisfactory; he came to the\r\nconclusion, as the result of his researches, that “medicines must only\r\nhave the power of curing diseases similar to those which they produce\r\nin the healthy body, and only manifest such morbid actions as they are\r\ncapable of curing in diseases.”[1024]\r\n\r\nHe thus proceeded to lay down the homœopathic law that the power of\r\nmedicines to alter the health must be _proved_ on the healthy body. He\r\nendeavoured to discover a rule by which the effect of remedies might be\r\nascertained, and which should supersede the old method of working in\r\nthe dark.\r\n\r\nConsidering the endless powers which medicines possess, and feeling\r\nsure that the Creator intended them to have some purpose, and that\r\nto lighten the afflictions of the race, he felt that there must be\r\na better way of employing them than that which he considered had so\r\ngrievously failed in the past. He was therefore henceforth the enemy\r\nof all empiricism. Antipathy, or the method by which contraries are\r\ncured by contraries, so that the diseased part is acted upon by\r\nsomething that opposes it, he considered a fatal error in medical\r\npractice. Contrary medicine he held could at best be palliative and\r\ntemporary, not curative. He designated as Allopathy the method by which\r\nit is attempted to remove natural disease from one part by exciting\r\nartificial disease in another, or the principle of counter irritation.\r\n\r\nThe sciences of anatomy and physiology are quite superfluous to the\r\nhomœopathist; the remedies being merely addressed to symptoms, the\r\nknowledge of their causes can have little or no concern to those who\r\nfollow Hahnemann’s doctrines. The application of a remedy for facial\r\nneuralgia, as Dr. Mapother points out,[1025] has been applied over the\r\nmotor nerve of the face, the inventor being ignorant that it has no\r\nconnection with sensibility.\r\n\r\nHahnemann taught that all chronic maladies proceed from the itch.\r\n\r\nAmongst other remedies for the itch, or psora, the swallowing of\r\nlice or a decoction of them was seriously recommended, because these\r\nparasites tickle the skin, and on the like-cures-like principle, would\r\nbe beneficial for itch![1026]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL SCIENCES.\r\n\r\nThe Natural Sciences in the closing years of the eighteenth century\r\nbegan to render the most important services to the art of medicine, and\r\nfrom that time onwards it has marked its progress step by step with the\r\nadvances of botany, chemistry, and physics. Linnæus invented a system\r\nof the classification of plants which Adanson, Jussieu, De Candolle,\r\nand others did much to improve; the anatomy and physiology, and even\r\nthe pathology of plants were closely studied, with results of the\r\ngreatest value to scientific medicine. Buffon excited the interest of\r\nmen of science by his declaration that there is no essential difference\r\nbetween animals and plants, and that all organic life follows the\r\nsame plan. He explained the geographical distribution of the animal\r\nkingdom. Hunter, Blumenbach, St. Hilaire, Cuvier, and others advanced\r\nthe sciences of comparative anatomy and physiology, and Lamarck divided\r\nbony animals into _vertebrata_ and _invertebrata_. Cuvier, by founding\r\nthe doctrine of types, explained the general plan on which animals are\r\nmodelled. Pander and Baer rendered the greatest services to the study\r\nof development—the former by his researches on the development of the\r\nchick, the latter by his observations on the cleavage in the ovum. To\r\nHunter, Kielmeyer, and Owen in a later period we owe the most important\r\ndiscovery—that the higher animals, even man himself, in the embryo pass\r\nthrough the stages of development of the lower animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMISTS.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH PRIESTLY discovered oxygen in 1772, and thus introduced a new\r\nchemical era. LAVOISIER, however, was the first to observe the vast\r\nimportance of the discovery, and CAVENDISH established his theories\r\nby his researches on the composition of the air, water, and acids. It\r\nis to Lavoisier’s discoveries in relation to oxygen that physiology\r\nis indebted for the knowledge of the influence of that element on\r\nrespiration and the blood. Doctors looked upon it as the “air of life,”\r\nand in its excess or deficiency saw the causes of certain diseases.\r\nFOURCROY applied himself to the study of medical chemistry.\r\n\r\nBERTHOLLET discovered the composition of ammonia, and the bleaching\r\nproperties of chlorine. He discovered chlorate of potash, and founded\r\nthe doctrine of chemical affinity.\r\n\r\nDALTON (1776-1844) by his atomic theory and his discovery of the law\r\nof multiple proportions still further advanced the science; in 1794 he\r\nfirst described colour-blindness.\r\n\r\nBERZELIUS (1779-1848) developed the atomic theory and improved our\r\nknowledge of animal chemistry.\r\n\r\nGAY-LUSSAC in 1805, with ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT, discovered that water\r\nis composed of one volume of oxygen and two volumes of hydrogen.\r\n\r\nSIR HUMPHRY DAVY (1788-1829) discovered the anæsthetic effect of\r\nnitrous oxide gas, invented the safety-lamp for miners, and greatly\r\nadvanced the study of agricultural chemistry.\r\n\r\nDUMAS (1800-1884) investigated the alkaloids.\r\n\r\nPELLETIER in 1820 discovered quinine.\r\n\r\nORFILA (1787-1853), one of the most eminent men of the French school of\r\nmedicine, founded modern toxicology, the science of poisons. His fame\r\nchiefly rests on his _Treatise of General Toxicology_ (1814), which is\r\na vast mine of experimental research on the symptoms of every kind of\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM HYDE WOOLASTON, M.D. (1766-1828), was a distinguished\r\nphilosopher and chemist. One of his great discoveries was the\r\nmalleability of platinum, which is said to have produced him no less\r\nthan thirty thousand pounds. He was even more famous as a student of\r\nophthalmology than as a chemist.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL FARADAY (1791-1867) was the great chemist, whose glory in\r\nchemical science was overshadowed by his electrical discoveries.\r\n\r\nJUSTUS VON LIEBIG (1803-1873) influenced the history of chemistry\r\nby his successful efforts to spread the knowledge of the science\r\nby improving the methods of investigation, and above all by the\r\napplication of chemistry to physiology, agriculture, and the arts.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICIANS.\r\n\r\nThe history of electricity has an important bearing on that of\r\nmedicine. It will be necessary at least to indicate the chief points in\r\nits progress. GILBERT published a treatise on the magnet in 1600. He\r\nspeaks of magnetic phenomena, and the extravagant stories circulated\r\nabout the attraction of magnets and amber by persons who gave no reason\r\nfrom experiment. He distinguished magnetic from electric forces,[1027]\r\nand it is to him that we owe the term “electric” itself.[1028]\r\n\r\nBoyle repeated the experiments of GILBERT, but seems to have made no\r\ndiscoveries. OTTO GUERICKE, of Magdeburg, next discovered that there\r\nis electric force of repulsion as well as of attraction. HAWKSBEE, in\r\nhis _Physico-Mechanical Experiments_, 1709, observed the effects of\r\nattraction and repulsion on threads hanging loosely. DUFAY, in 1733,\r\n1734, and 1737, observed that electric bodies attract all those that\r\nare not so, and repel them as soon as they are become electric by the\r\nvicinity or contact of the electric body. In 1729, GREY discovered the\r\nproperties of _conductors_.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN distinguished between positive and negative electricity in\r\n1747, and demonstrated the identity of the electric spark and lightning\r\nin 1752. GALVANI in 1791 laid the foundation of the Galvanic Battery.\r\nVOLTA discovered the “Voltaic pile” in 1800. Henceforward year by year\r\nthe science progressed by leaps and bounds. The use of the magnet in\r\nmedicine was known to Aetius, who lived A.D. 500. He says: “We are\r\nassured that those who are troubled with the gout in their hands or\r\ntheir feet, or with convulsions, find relief when they hold a magnet\r\nin their hand.” Beckmann says[1029] this is the oldest account of\r\nthis virtue of the magnet. The more ancient writers refer only to its\r\ninternal uses. Lessing ascribes the external use of the magnet as a\r\ncure for toothache and other disorders to Paracelsus. Marcellus in the\r\nfifteenth century assures us that the magnet cures toothache, as also\r\ndoes Leonard Camillus in the sixteenth century. Wecker about the same\r\nperiod says it cures headache. Porta (1591) confirms this, and Kircher\r\n(1643) states that it was worn about the neck to prevent convulsions\r\nand nervous disorders. Magnetic toothpicks and ear-pickers were\r\nextolled as cures for disorders of the teeth, ears, and eyes about the\r\nend of the seventeenth century.[1030]\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHROPOLOGY.\r\n\r\nJOH. F. BLUMENBACH (1752-1840), professor in Göttingen, was the founder\r\nof Anthropology. He collected a great museum of skulls, and was famous\r\nas a comparative anatomist. He wrote on physiology, anatomy, and\r\nnatural history.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHERS.\r\n\r\nVON SCHELLING (1775-1854) taught that “God is the indifference of the\r\nideal and real, soul and body, and the identity of subjectivity and\r\nobjectivity. In a word, the All.” He held that health is the harmony of\r\nreproduction, irritability, and sensibility; disease, the alteration\r\nof dimensions of the organism, by which it ceases to be a pure,\r\nuntroubled reflex of the All.\r\n\r\nG. W. F. HEGEL (1770-1831) was the philosopher whose supreme principle\r\nwas absolute reason, and to whom in a great measure is due what is\r\nknown as Modern Materialism. He was opposed by R. H. LOTZE (1817-1884),\r\na medical philosopher of Göttingen, the author of the _Mikrokosmos_\r\nand works on pathology, physiology, and psychology. He laid it down\r\nthat the significance of the phenomena of life and mind would only\r\nunfold itself when by an exhausted survey of the entire life of man,\r\nindividually, socially, and historically, we gain the necessary data\r\nfor explaining the microcosm by the macrocosm of the universe. The\r\nworld of facts and the laws of nature are only to be understood by the\r\nidea of a personal deity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN (1809-1882), grandson of Erasmus Darwin, startled and\r\nshocked the whole Christian world by his theory that man has possibly\r\ndescended at a highly remote period from “a group of marine animals\r\nresembling the larvæ of existing Ascidians.” He traced our ancestry\r\nthrough the fish, amphibian, marsupial, and ape species; a theory\r\nwhich, despite the original opposition it excited, is now generally\r\naccepted. He is best known in connection with medical science by his\r\nfamous work, _On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection_,\r\n1859, his _Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex_, 1871, and\r\n_The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals_, 1872. At first his\r\ntheory of the Descent of Man was held to teach that\r\n\r\n    “A very tall pig with a very long nose\r\n    Puts forth a proboscis quite down to his toes,\r\n    And then by the name of an elephant goes.”\r\n\r\nDarwin recognised not merely a God but a Creator.\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMISTS AND BIOLOGISTS.\r\n\r\nSIR RICHARD OWEN, M.D., F.R.S., etc. (1804-1892), the celebrated\r\ncomparative anatomist and palæontologist, made it possible for us to\r\nsee what the extinct monsters were when he enabled us to construct\r\nscientifically the models of the megatherium, plesiosaurus, and other\r\nanimals of remote ages. It has been well said of him that “the most\r\ncharacteristic of his faculties was a powerful scientific imagination.\r\nFragments of bone which might be meaningless to less alert observers\r\nenabled him to divine the structure and to present the images of whole\r\ngroups of extinct animal forms.”\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of Dr. Abernethy (whose pupil he had been) he was\r\ninvited in 1828 to prepare the catalogue of the Hunterian collection in\r\nthe museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, of which Mr. Clift (whom\r\nhe eventually succeeded and whose daughter he married) was conservator.\r\nThis great work largely occupied some of the best years of Owen’s life,\r\nthe three quarto volumes on the Fossil Vertebrates and Cephalopods of\r\nthe collection not appearing till 1855. Meanwhile he had given to the\r\nworld his _Odontography_, his _Lectures on Comparative Anatomy and\r\nPhysiology_ (which won a continental reputation), and his famous work\r\non the _Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton_. In 1849\r\nhe issued an important memoir _On Parthenogenesis_.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Owen was appointed Superintendent of the Department of Natural\r\nHistory in the British Museum, which, through his untiring exertions,\r\nwas at last to be suitably housed at South Kensington. In 1861 he\r\npublished his manual of _Paleontology_; from 1865 to 1877 a succession\r\nof works on British Fossil Reptiles and the Fossil Reptiles of South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nF. G. HENLE (1809-1885) so early as 1840 advocated the germ theory of\r\ndisease. It was first suggested, however, by Latour’s discovery of the\r\nyeast plant in 1836.\r\n\r\nST. GEORGE MIVART, M.D., F.R.S. (born 1827), the distinguished\r\nanatomist and zoologist, is to a certain extent the opponent of Darwin,\r\nas he denies that the doctrine of Evolution is applicable to the human\r\nintellect. He is the author of many works on anatomy, biology, and\r\nzoology.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HUXLEY, F.R.S., M.D. (born 1825), the famous physiologist and\r\ncomparative anatomist and biologist, is a well-known writer on natural\r\nscience, and the most prominent of the scientific opponents of revealed\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nDR. ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE (born 1822), the eminent naturalist,\r\npublished his _Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection_ in\r\n1870, and in 1878, in his volume _Tropical Nature_, still further\r\ncontributes to our knowledge of sexual selection, etc.\r\n\r\nERNST HAECKEL (born 1834), a celebrated German naturalist and writer on\r\nscience, is the chief supporter in Germany of Darwin’s theories. It may\r\nbe remembered in this connection that these were anticipated to some\r\nextent by Lamarck (1744-1829) and Goethe (1749-1832).\r\n\r\nHERBERT SPENCER (born 1820) has devoted his life mainly to the working\r\nout of his “System of Synthetic Philosophy,” which proposed “to carry\r\nout in its application to all orders of phenomena the general law of\r\nevolution.”\r\n\r\nGEORGE J. ROMANES, F.R.S. (born 1848), an ardent member of the\r\nDarwinian school, is a distinguished physiologist and biologist.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICIANS AND PATHOLOGISTS.\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD AUENBRUGGER (1722-1809), a physician of Vienna, was the\r\ninventor of the method of detecting diseases of the chest by\r\npercussion. By striking the chest _directly_ with the tips of the\r\nfingers (not as we do now by interposing a finger of our left hand\r\nwhile we percuss the chest mediately with the fingers of the other\r\nhand) he diagnosed by the sound evoked the condition of the organs of\r\nthe thorax. His system was at first received with contempt and ridicule\r\nby his profession; but in 1808, Corvisart translated Auenbrugger’s\r\ngreat work, the _Inventum Novum_, into French, and the method quickly\r\nachieved an European reputation.\r\n\r\nRENÉ T. H. LAËNNEC (1781-1826), the celebrated French pathologist,\r\nwas the inventor of the stethoscope. His great discovery was purely\r\naccidental—a fact which he declares in his famous work.\r\n\r\n“In 1816 I was consulted by a young woman labouring under general\r\nsymptoms of diseased heart, and in whose case percussion and the\r\napplication of the hand were of little avail on account of the great\r\ndegree of fatness. I happened to recollect a simple and well-known fact\r\nin acoustics, and fancied it might be turned to some use on the present\r\noccasion. The fact I allude to is the great distinctness with which we\r\nhear the scratch of a pin at one end of a piece of wood, on applying\r\nour ear to the other. Immediately, on this suggestion, I rolled a\r\nquire of paper into a kind of cylinder, and applied one end of it to\r\nthe region of the heart and the other to my ear, and was not a little\r\nsurprised and pleased to find that I could thereby perceive the action\r\nof the heart in a manner much more clear and distinct than I had ever\r\nbeen able to do by the immediate application of the ear.”[1031]\r\n\r\nJEAN N. CORVISART (1755-1821) introduced into France Auenbrugger’s\r\nmethod of percussion, one of the most important aids to _physical\r\ndiagnosis_.\r\n\r\nGASPARD L. BAYLE (1774-1816) made those important researches on\r\ntubercle and the changes in the lungs and other organs in consumption\r\nwhich form the basis of our present knowledge of the subject. From\r\nthis time French physicians introduced great precision in their study\r\nof symptoms, so as to invest them with a really scientific character.\r\nCombined with the perfected methods of anatomical observation, a new\r\nera in clinical medicine dates from this period.\r\n\r\nLOUIS (1787-1872) made important researches on pulmonary consumption\r\nand typhoid fever, and introduced the numerical or statistical method\r\nin medical science, which was an important step towards making it an\r\nexact science.\r\n\r\nSIR ROBERT CHRISTISON (1797-1882) discovered the effects and properties\r\nof Calabar bean, and was the most famous of all English investigators\r\nof poisons and poisoning.\r\n\r\nJOHN CHEYNE (1777-1836), in conjunction with WILLIAM STOKES\r\n(1804-1878), a great clinical teacher and author of works on diseases\r\nof the chest and heart, discovered the form of breathing in certain\r\ndisordered conditions which is called “Cheyne-Stokes’ respiration.”\r\n\r\nROBERT J. GRAVES (1797-1853), a great observer and clinical teacher,\r\ngave his name to a disease.\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM JENNER, M.D. (born 1815), was the first to establish beyond\r\ndispute the difference between typhus and typhoid fevers.\r\n\r\nJOHN HUGHES BENNETT, M.D. (1812-1875), was the first to introduce the\r\nuse of cod-liver oil in consumption into English practice (1841). He\r\nclaimed also to have discovered leucocythemia before Virchow.\r\n\r\nALFRED SWAYNE TAYLOR, M.D. (1806-1880), was the founder of forensic\r\nmedicine in England, and his great work on Medical Jurisprudence\r\n(published 1836) has long been the standard authority in medico-legal\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HODGKIN (1797-1866) discovered the disease which goes by his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nCHARLES MURCHISON, M.D. (1830-1879), is celebrated for his researches\r\nin epidemic diseases.\r\n\r\nSIR THOMAS WATSON (1792-1882) was the author of the ever-popular\r\nlectures, _The Practice of Physic_, a work whose graces of style and\r\nelegance of phraseology entitle it to be considered a medical classic.\r\n\r\nMATTHEW BAILLIE (1761-1823) was a famous pathologist. He devoted\r\nspecial attention to the pathology of the brain, heart, lungs, stomach,\r\nand intestines. It was he who first described the grey miliary tubercle\r\nof consumption. In all his profound researches he never failed to\r\nremember their practical end in the cure of disease.\r\n\r\nJOHN ABERCROMBIE (1780-1844) is celebrated for his researches on\r\ndiseases of the brain and spinal cord.\r\n\r\nRICHARD BRIGHT (1789-1858), the reformer of renal pathology, was the\r\ndiscoverer of the disease which bears his name.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS ADDISON (1793-1860) discovered the disease of the suprarenal\r\nbodies which is called after him.\r\n\r\nKARL V. ROKITANSKY (1804-1878), one of the most famous of the founders\r\nof the New Vienna School, was so indefatigable a pathologist that he is\r\nsaid to have celebrated his thirty-thousandth post-mortem in 1866. His\r\ngreat work, _The Handbook of Pathological Anatomy_, was published in\r\n1841.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH SKODA (1805-1881), a physician of the New Vienna School,\r\nimproved physical diagnosis by his application of the laws of sound. He\r\nrendered percussion more perfect by correctly explaining the import of\r\nthe various sounds heard on striking the chest. He threw great light\r\nupon our knowledge of the phenomena of heart diseases.\r\n\r\nHEBRA (1816-1880) created a revolution in the science of skin diseases\r\nby basing it upon pathological anatomy.\r\n\r\nWUNDERLICH (1815-1877) introduced the use of the clinical thermometer\r\nas an important aid to diagnosis, and claimed that “pathology is the\r\nphysiology of sick men.”\r\n\r\nRUDOLPH VIRCHOW (born 1821), the constructor of the cellular pathology,\r\nis a celebrated German pathologist and anthropologist. On the basis\r\nof the cellular theory, which teaches that the cells live their own\r\nindependent life, have their own active properties, proliferations\r\nand degenerations, Virchow built up his cellular pathology into a\r\ncomprehensive system, attaching greater importance to the cell changes\r\nthan to an altered condition of the circulation or quality of the\r\nblood, as was previously held to account for pathological changes.\r\nThe theory explains many facts which were previously obscure, but is\r\nnot wholly satisfactory. Virchow’s system led to the foundation of\r\npathological histology.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW CLARK, M.D., F.R.S., President of the College of Physicians,\r\nLondon (born 1826), is a physician distinguished alike for his profound\r\nscientific knowledge and his admirable skill in its application to\r\nthe relief and cure of disease. As a physiologist, anatomist, and\r\npathologist, especially in connection with the organs of respiration,\r\nthe kidneys, and digestive functions, Sir Andrew Clark occupies the\r\nforemost place in English medical practice of the time. He has written\r\nextensively on diseases of the chest, is one of the most brilliant\r\nclinical lecturers of the day, and for many years has been a chief\r\nattraction in the teaching power of the London Hospital.\r\n\r\nSIR EDWARD H. SIEVEKING, M.D., etc. (born 1816), was with Dr. H. Jones\r\njoint-author of the well-known _Manual of Pathological Anatomy_ (1854).\r\n\r\nSAMUEL WILKS, M.D., F.R.S., etc. (born 1824), is an eminent pathologist\r\nand neurologist. He published his excellent _Lectures on Pathological\r\nAnatomy_ in 1859.[1032]\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAIN AND NERVE SPECIALISTS.\r\n\r\nPHILIPPE PINEL (1745-1826), a French physician, published a translation\r\nof Cullen’s _Nosology_ (1785) in the language of his country. His claim\r\nto our gratitude rests on the fact that he was among the first to\r\nintroduce the humane treatment of the insane. With his own hands he,\r\nwhen physician to the Bicêtre and Salpêtrière, removed the bonds of\r\ninsane patients who had been chained to the wall for years.\r\n\r\nSIR CHARLES BELL (1774-1842) made the greatest discoveries in\r\nphysiology since those of Harvey. We owe to him the knowledge that in\r\nthe nervous trunks are special sensory filaments whose office is to\r\nconvey impressions from the periphery to the sensorium, and special\r\nmotor filaments which convey motor impressions from the brain or other\r\nnerve centre to the muscles. This great discovery of the functions of\r\nthe nerves, concerning which there previously existed much confusion\r\namongst physiologists, was published in 1807, and entitles England to\r\nclaim that in Bell and Harvey she has given to science the two most\r\ndistinguished physiologists of the world.\r\n\r\nFRANZ J. GALL (1757-1828) was a skilful Viennese anatomist, who, by his\r\nresearches upon the anatomy of the brain, came to the conclusion that\r\nthe talents and dispositions of men may be inferred with exactitude\r\nfrom the external appearance of the skull, and thus founded phrenology.\r\n\r\nCASPAR SPURZHEIM (1776-1832), an anatomist, was a pupil of Gall, and\r\nassisted in the development of phrenology.\r\n\r\nJEAN M. CHARCOT (born 1825) is a Paris physician greatly distinguished\r\nby his important investigations in diseases of the nervous system, upon\r\nwhich he has written many works.\r\n\r\nPIERRE FLOURENS (1794-1867), a distinguished French physiologist,\r\nsought to assign their special functions to the brain, corpora\r\nquadrigemina, and lesser brain by experiments. In 1847 he directed\r\nthe attention of the Academy of Sciences to the anæsthetic effect of\r\nchloroform upon animals. Chloric ether in the same year was used at St.\r\nBartholomew’s Hospital as an anæsthetic in operations by Dr. Furnell.\r\n\r\nARMAND TROUSSEAU (1801-1866) was an eloquent and popular clinical\r\nlecturer on medicine. He introduced tracheotomy in croup, and largely\r\ncontributed to our knowledge of laryngeal phthisis, etc.\r\n\r\nCLAUDE BERNARD (1813-1878), the celebrated experimental physiologist\r\nand pathologist, made numerous researches on the digestion of fat by\r\nthe pancreatic juice, the formation of sugar in the liver, and the\r\nartificial production of diabetes by puncturing the fourth ventricle\r\nof the brain, etc. He wrote _Physiologie et Pathologie du Systeme\r\nnerveux_, 1858.\r\n\r\nBROWN-SEQUARD (born 1817), the experimental physiologist, discovered\r\nthe vaso-motor nerves. He has investigated the functions of the spinal\r\ncord, its normal and pathological states, the brain and sympathetic\r\nnerves and ganglions, the inhibitory and other nerves.\r\n\r\nPAUL BERT (1833-1886) was a physiologist and neuro-pathologist.\r\n\r\nG. B. DUCHENNE (1806-1875) introduced electro-therapeutics by means of\r\nthe induced current in diseases of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nROBERT REMAK (1815-1865) still further pursued the treatment of nervous\r\ndiseases by means of the constant current. He investigated the subject\r\nof the parasitic origin of certain diseases of the skin, and produced\r\nfavus experimentally.\r\n\r\nELIE VON CYON (born 1843) continued the investigation of\r\nelectro-therapeutics.\r\n\r\nMARSHALL HALL (1790-1857) discovered reflex action, which fact he\r\ncommunicated to the Royal Society in 1833.\r\n\r\nJAMES BRAID, a Manchester surgeon, in 1841 investigated mesmerism,\r\nand discovered what is now called hypnotism. He found that he could\r\nartificially produce “a peculiar condition of the nervous system,\r\ninduced by a fixed and abstracted attention of the mental and visual\r\neye on one object, not of an exciting nature.” Thus Braid was the first\r\nto investigate the subject scientifically, and to trace the phenomena\r\nof mesmerism to their true physiological cause. Dr. Rudolf Heidenhain,\r\nof Breslau, has recently traced these phenomena to inhibitory nervous\r\naction.[1033]\r\n\r\nHENRY MAUDSLEY, M.D. (born 1835), is the author of several important\r\nworks on mental diseases: _The Physiology of Mind_, _The Pathology of\r\nMind_, _Body and Mind_, and _Responsibility in Mental Disease_.\r\n\r\nJOHN CONOLLY (1796-1866) was physician to Hanwell Asylum. To him is\r\ndue the honour of having first in England pressed upon the notice of\r\nhis profession the advantages of the “No Restraint” system in mental\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nDR. FORBES WINSLOW was a popular and humane “mad doctor.”\r\n\r\nJOHN C. BUCKNILL, M.D., F.R.S., etc. (born 1817), is a distinguished\r\nstudent of mental diseases, and the author of several treatises on\r\nUnsoundness of Mind in relation to Crime and Drunkenness. He is one of\r\nthe original editors of _Brain_, and for nine years he has edited the\r\n_Journal of Mental Science_.\r\n\r\nDAVID FERRIER, M.D., F.R.S., etc. (born 1843), a specialist in brain\r\nsurgery, is well known for his researches in cerebral physiology\r\nand pathology, and has acquired great celebrity throughout the\r\nEnglish-speaking world for his investigations connected with the\r\nlocalisation of the functions of the brain.\r\n\r\nPAUL BROCA (1824-1880), the surgeon and anatomist, discovered that the\r\nfaculty of speech lies in the third left frontal convolution of the\r\nbrain, which in his honour is called Broca’s convolution.\r\n\r\nJULES BECLARD (1818-1887) was a distinguished French physiologist.\r\n\r\nHENRY C. BASTIAN, M.D., F.R.S. (b. 1837), is a pathological anatomist\r\nand cerebral physiologist. His _Brain as an Organ of Mind_, 1880, is\r\none of his best known works, and his articles in Quain’s _Dictionary of\r\nMedicine_, on Diseases of the Spinal Cord and Nervous System generally,\r\nare equally valuable contributions to this department of medical\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nJOHN HUGHLINGS JACKSON, M.D., F.R.S., although distinguished as an\r\nophthalmologist, is more famous for his researches and discoveries in\r\nconnection with the nervous system and the localisation of cerebral\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nDR. JULIUS ALTHAUS has made many valuable contributions to our\r\nknowledge of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nVICTOR A. H. HORSLEY, F.R.S., etc., pathologist and brain surgeon, is\r\nthe author of many papers on the functions of the brain and spinal\r\ncord, and has made important contributions to our knowledge of the\r\nfunctions of the thyroid gland, hitherto little understood, by which\r\nthe treatment of myxœdema will, it is hoped, be greatly improved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURGEONS.\r\n\r\nThe founding of museums of anatomy and surgical pathology by the\r\nHUNTERS, DUPUYTREN, CLOQUET, BLUMENBACH, BARCLAY, and a great\r\nnumber of other anatomists and surgeons, has greatly assisted to\r\nadvance the practical surgery of this century. Some of the more\r\nimportant improvements in the art as practised at the present time\r\nare the following, which are given in the article on Surgery in the\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_:—The thin thread ligature for arteries,\r\nintroduced by JONES, of Jersey (1805); the revival of the twisting\r\nof arteries to arrest bleeding by AMUSSAT (1829); the practice of\r\ndrainage in large wounds and after operations by CHASSAIGNAC (1859);\r\naspiration or the application of the principle of the air-pump for\r\nremoving pus and fluid from tumours, etc., by PELLETAN and others; the\r\nplaster-of-Paris bandage and other similar immovable applications for\r\nfractures, etc. (an old Eastern practice recommended in Europe about\r\n1814 by the English consul at Bassorah); the re-breaking of badly set\r\nfractures; galvanocaustics and écraseurs; the general introduction\r\nof resection of joints (FERGUSSON, SYME, and others); tenotomy by\r\nDELPECH and STROMEYER (1831); operation for squint by DIEFFENBACH\r\n(1842); successful ligature of great arteries by ABERNETHY and ASTLEY\r\nCOOPER (1806); crushing of stone in the bladder by GRUITHUISEN of\r\nMunich (1819), and CIVIALE of Paris (1826); cure of ovarian dropsy by\r\nthe removal of the cyst, discovery of the ophthalmoscope, and great\r\nimprovements in ophthalmic surgery by VON GRÄFE and others; application\r\nof the laryngoscope in operations on the larynx by CZERMAK (1860) and\r\nothers, together with additions to the resources of aural surgery and\r\ndentistry.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of fractures English surgery was inferior to that\r\nof continental practice, especially French, in the early part of the\r\npresent century. M. ROUX in 1814 pointed out our shortcomings in\r\nthis respect, contrasting English with French methods much to our\r\ndisadvantage.[1034]\r\n\r\nSIR WM. BLIZZARD (1743-1835) was the first surgeon who tied the\r\nsuperior thyroid artery for goitre. He founded in conjunction with\r\nMaclaurin the medical school of the London Hospital.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN BELL (1763-1820), of Edinburgh, was the elder brother of Sir\r\nCharles Bell. He was professor of anatomy, surgery, and obstetrics, a\r\nman of letters and a famous operator. He published a _System of the\r\nAnatomy of the Human Body_ and _The Principles of Surgery_.\r\n\r\nJOHN ABERNETHY (1764-1831), the celebrated surgeon and lecturer on\r\nanatomy, became the founder of the distinguished school of surgery and\r\nanatomy at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London.\r\n\r\nSIR ASTLEY COOPER (1768-1841) was the first surgeon to tie the\r\nabdominal aorta.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN BRODIE (1783-1862) was an anatomist and physiologist, as\r\nwell as a distinguished surgeon.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM COLLES, M.D. (1773-1843), was an eminent Dublin surgeon, the\r\nauthor of a work on _Surgical Anatomy_, who has given his name to the\r\nfracture of the radius at the wrist.\r\n\r\nJOHN BURNS, M.D. (1775-1850), was a teacher of surgery and midwifery\r\nat Glasgow. His world-wide reputation was gained for him by his\r\n_Principles of Midwifery_.\r\n\r\nJAMES WARDROP (1782-1869) was the author of a well-known treatise on\r\nthe pathology of the human eye.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN TRAVERS (1783-1858) was celebrated for his theory of\r\n“Constitutional Irritation.”\r\n\r\nLISTON (1794-1847) was famous for his resections of the elbow and other\r\njoints.\r\n\r\nSIR WM. LAURENCE (1783-1867) was one of the greatest clinical teachers\r\nthe British school of surgery has produced.\r\n\r\nGEORGE GUTHRIE (1785-1856) accompanied Wellington in his campaigns, and\r\nwas in his time the great English authority on military surgery.\r\n\r\nJAMES SYME (1799-1870) was a distinguished teacher of clinical surgery.\r\nHe improved the operation of exarticulation at the knee-joint, and\r\nrecommended the operation for amputating at the ankle which goes by his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nSIR JAMES PAGET, F.R.S. (born 1814), the distinguished surgeon, is the\r\nauthor of the _Pathological Catalogue of the Museum of the College of\r\nSurgeons_, _Lectures on Surgical Pathology_, etc.\r\n\r\nJOHN ERIC ERICHSEN, F.R.S. (born 1818), is the author of _The Science\r\nand Art of Surgery_, which has not only gone through nine large\r\neditions in this country, but has passed through many editions in\r\nAmerica, and has been translated into German, Spanish, Italian, and\r\nChinese (partly). Probably no treatise on English surgery has exercised\r\nso much influence on the progress of this branch of the healing art as\r\nMr. Erichsen’s noble work.\r\n\r\nJONATHAN HUTCHINSON, F.R.S. (born 1828), one of the most distinguished\r\nsurgeons of the Victorian age, is famous throughout the empire as a\r\nclinical teacher, especially in connection with specific and skin\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nSIR HENRY THOMPSON (born 1820), the distinguished surgeon and\r\npathologist, is famous for his researches in the pathology of the\r\nurethra and prostate gland, and for his clinical teaching in lithotomy\r\nand lithotrity. He has taken an active part in the cremation propaganda.\r\n\r\nSIR W. J. ERASMUS WILSON (1809-1884) was the famous specialist in\r\nskin diseases, whose munificent benefactions to the Royal College of\r\nSurgeons have enormously extended the resources of its museum and\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\n\r\nGYNÆCOLOGISTS.\r\n\r\nSIR T. SPENCER WELLS, M.D. (born 1818), the celebrated ovariotomist,\r\nand MR. LAWSON TAIT, well described by Dr. Baas as “the magical\r\noperator and despiser of antiseptics,” in abdominal diseases,\r\nespecially those of women, are without rivals in the world as\r\nbenefactors to humanity by their life-saving discoveries.\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMY IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nUntil 1832 the bodies of executed murderers were ordered for\r\ndissection, by 32 Hen. VIII. c. 42, 1540. Surgeons were granted four\r\nbodies of executed malefactors for “_anathomyes_” which privilege was\r\nextended in the following reigns; but in consequence of the crimes\r\ncommitted by “resurrection men” in order to supply the medical schools,\r\na new statute was passed in 1832, which prohibited the dissection of\r\nmurderers, and provided for the necessities of the dissecting room by\r\npermitting, under certain regulations, the dissection of the bodies of\r\nunclaimed persons dying in workhouses, etc.\r\n\r\nInspectors of anatomy were appointed, and various regulations were\r\nmade for the decent and reverent disposal of the remains. The Anatomy\r\nAct was passed in consequence of the scandals connected with the\r\ngreat Anatomy School at Edinburgh, at which Dr. Knox was a celebrated\r\nteacher. It was discovered that a murderer named Burke provided bodies\r\nfor surgeons by killing his victims by suffocation, leaving no marks of\r\nviolence. The crime was known as Burking, and to remove the temptation\r\nto such scandals as the robbery of graveyards, and the murder of\r\npersons for the sake of the prices paid for their bodies, the wants of\r\nthe surgeons were provided for in a legal manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH SURGEONS.\r\n\r\nALEXIS BOYER (1757-1833), one of the most eminent French teachers of\r\nsurgery, wrote a great work on surgical diseases and operations, in\r\neleven volumes.\r\n\r\nJEAN D. LARRY (1766-1842) was a famous military surgeon under Napoleon.\r\nHis opportunities for studying his profession must have been unique, as\r\nhe participated in sixty great battles and four hundred engagements.\r\nHe wrote several treatises on military medicine and invented field\r\nambulances.\r\n\r\nPHILIBERT J. ROUX (1780-1854), surgeon to the Hôtel Dieu at Paris,\r\npractised resections of joints, by which the articular diseased\r\nextremity of the bone is removed and a false joint formed.\r\n\r\nJACQUES LISFRANC (1790-1847) was a famous amputator, whose operation\r\nfor the partial removal of the foot is known by his name.\r\n\r\nARMAND VELPEAU (1795-1867) was a celebrated teacher of clinical surgery.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH MALGAIGNE (1806-1865) was a very distinguished writer on\r\nsurgical anatomy and operative surgery.\r\n\r\nAUGUSTE NELATON (1807-1874) was called “the Napoleon of Surgery.” He\r\ninvented the probe by which he detected the bullet in the wound of\r\nGaribaldi.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN SURGEONS.\r\n\r\nPlastic operations were revived by C. F. VON GRAEFE, of Warsaw\r\n(1787-1840), DELPECH, DIEFFENBACH, B. LANGENBECK, and others. After\r\nsevere burns there is frequently great loss of skin; it was found\r\nthat this could be repaired by the transplantation of very minute\r\nportions of skin from healthy surfaces; periosteum and bones were also\r\nsuccessfully transplanted.\r\n\r\nVON KERN (1769-1829), the great Viennese surgeon, emphatically insisted\r\nthat surgery could not be divorced from medicine. He adopted the very\r\nopposite treatment of wounds to that followed now by Lister; instead of\r\nexcluding the air for fear of the germs contained in it, he insisted\r\nthat operative wounds should be freely exposed to the atmosphere. He\r\napplied the simplest dressings of wet lint.\r\n\r\nF. SCHUH (1804-1865) greatly advanced scientific surgery by advocating\r\nthe use of the microscope in pathological anatomy.\r\n\r\nVON WALTHER (1782-1849) was a great and scrupulously careful surgical\r\noperator, who, like Kern, declared that surgery and medicine are\r\nindivisible.\r\n\r\nVON CHELIUS (1794-1876), a famous teacher of clinical surgery at\r\nHeidelberg, was a well-known writer on surgery.\r\n\r\nCONRAD J. M. LANGENBECK (1776-1851) and BERNHARD LANGENBECK (1810-1887)\r\ngreatly contributed to found military surgery in Germany.\r\n\r\nG. F. L. STROMEYER (1804-1876), a famous military surgeon of Germany,\r\nobtained great success in that department of operative surgery known as\r\nsubcutaneous division of tendons for the relief and cure of deformities\r\nsuch as club foot.\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH ESMARCH (born 1823) is famous for his invention of the\r\nmethod of bloodless amputations of limbs by the use of the bandage of\r\nindia-rubber which goes by his name.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN SURGEONS.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE MOTT (1785-1865), the celebrated New York surgeon, is said\r\nto have tied more arteries for the relief or cure of surgical diseases\r\nthan any other surgeon.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL GROSS (1805-1884), a great American teacher of surgery, was the\r\nauthor of the well-known _System of Surgery_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPHTHALMIC SURGEONS.\r\n\r\nJ. A. H. REIMARUS (1729-1814), of Hamburg, first employed belladonna in\r\nophthalmic surgery.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH BARTH (1745-1818), of Malta, founded an ophthalmic hospital, and\r\nfirst lectured on eye diseases and their treatment.\r\n\r\nJUNG-STILLING (1740-1817) was a celebrated coucher of cataracts.\r\n\r\nDR. THOMAS YOUNG (1773-1829) rendered great services to optical\r\nscience, and was the first to describe astigmatism, or the want of\r\nsymmetry in the anterior refracting surfaces of the eyeball—a disorder\r\nof vision which has considerable influence in causing headache.\r\n\r\nJ. A. SCHMIDT (1759-1809) first described syphilitic iritis; he called\r\neye disease with great justice “the elegant diminishing mirror of\r\ndiseases of the body.”\r\n\r\nC. HIMLY (1772-1837) used mydriatics (dilators of the pupil, such\r\nas hyoscyamus and belladonna) in operations on the eye. Atropine\r\nafterwards superseded these.\r\n\r\nG. J. BEER (1763-1821), a professor of Vienna, founded the famous\r\nteaching of the Vienna school of ophthalmology, and greatly improved\r\nthe practice of the art and the instruments employed in it.\r\n\r\nH. L. HELMHOLTZ (born 1821) invented that powerful aid to the\r\nophthalmic surgeon—the ophthalmoscope—in 1851. It is said that the\r\nobservation of the reddening of the pupil in a drowning cat first\r\nsuggested the invention to Méry in 1704. Helmholtz’s invention made\r\nscientific ophthalmology possible. This branch of surgery may be said\r\nto date from this great discovery.\r\n\r\nHERMANN SNELLEN (born 1834), an oculist of Utrecht, introduced test\r\ntypes for ascertaining the distinctness of vision.\r\n\r\nR. BRUDENELL CARTER, the eminent ophthalmologist, is a well-known and\r\ngraceful writer on medical and scientific subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL REFORMS.\r\n\r\n Discovery of Anæsthetics.—Medical Literature.—Nursing Reform.—History\r\n of the Treatment of the Insane.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSERVATIVE SURGERY.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as “conservative surgery” is the distinguishing feature\r\nof the art as practised at the present day. Whatever Lord Tennyson\r\nmay have had in his mind in his lines on the children’s hospital, the\r\nhighest surgical practice now is to save diseased and injured parts as\r\nmuch as possible, instead of removing them. Antiseptic surgery and the\r\ndiscovery of anæsthetics have alone made this possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF ANÆSTHETICS.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have a drug named Mago, by which they have been able, so\r\nthey maintain, to destroy pain for thousands of years past. The vapour\r\nof hemp seed and the drug mandragora have for ages been employed for\r\nanæsthetic purposes previous to surgical operations. In Homer’s time\r\nthe properties of opium were well understood, and other narcotic drugs\r\nwere used for the same purpose. Patients were also sometimes stupefied\r\nby strong drink, and among some savage tribes banana wine was copiously\r\nadministered so as to intoxicate the patient. It was not, however,\r\nuntil the discovery of the true anæsthesia produced by sulphuric ether\r\nand chloroform that grave surgical operations could be performed\r\nwithout causing pain to the patient. Nitrous oxide gas, discovered by\r\nPriestley in 1776, was recommended as an anæsthetic by Davy in 1800,\r\nand its use was begun in America by Wells, the dentist, in 1844. The\r\ndiscovery that by inhaling ether the patient is rendered unconscious\r\nof pain is due to Dr. C. T. Jackson, of Boston, U.S. Mr. T. Morton,\r\nof the same city, first introduced it into surgical practice in 1846.\r\nChloroform was discovered by Souberain in 1831, and independently by\r\nLiebig in 1832. Dumas determined its composition in 1834. JACOB BELL\r\nin London, and Dr. SIMPSON in Edinburgh, first applied chloroform\r\nexperimentally. The late Professor James Miller thus describes the\r\ndiscovery of the anæsthetic effects of chloroform:[1035] “The trial\r\nproceeded, and the safety as well as suitableness of anæsthesia, by\r\nether, became more and more established. But a new phase was at hand.\r\nMy friend, Dr. Simpson, had long felt convinced that some anæsthetic\r\nagent existed superior to ether, and, in the end of October, 1847,\r\nbeing then engaged in writing a paper on ‘Etherization in Surgery,’\r\nhe began to make experiments on himself and friends in regard to the\r\neffects of other respirable matters—other ethers, essential oils, and\r\nvarious gases; chloride of hydrocarbon, acetone, nitrate of oxide of\r\nethyl, benzine, the vapour of iodoform, etc. The ordinary method of\r\nexperimenting was as follows: Each ‘operator’ having been provided\r\nwith a tumbler, finger glass, saucer, or some such vessel, about a\r\nteaspoonful of the respirable substance was put in the bottom of it,\r\nand this again was placed in hot water, if the substance happened to\r\nbe not very volatile. Holding the mouth and nostrils over the vessel’s\r\norifice, inhalation was proceeded with, slowly and deliberately,\r\nall inhaling at the same time, and each noting the effects as they\r\nadvanced. Late one evening—it was the 4th November, 1847—Dr. Simpson,\r\nwith his two friends and assistants, Drs. Keith and Matthews Duncan,\r\nsat down to their somewhat hazardous work in Dr. Simpson’s dining-room.\r\nHaving inhaled several substances, but without much effect, it occurred\r\nto Dr. Simpson to try a ponderous material, which he had formerly\r\nset aside on a lumber-table, and which, on account of its great\r\nweight, he had hitherto regarded as of no likelihood whatever. That\r\nhappened to be a small bottle of chloroform. It was searched for, and\r\nrecovered from beneath a heap of waste paper. And, with each tumbler\r\nnewly charged, the inhalers resumed their vocation. Immediately an\r\nunwonted hilarity seized the party; they became bright-eyed, very\r\nhappy, and very loquacious—expatiating on the delicious aroma of the\r\nnew fluid. The conversation was of unusual intelligence, and quite\r\ncharmed the listeners—some ladies of the family, and a naval officer,\r\nbrother-in-law of Dr. Simpson. But suddenly there was a talk of\r\nsounds being heard like those of a cotton-mill, louder and louder; a\r\nmoment more, then all was quiet, and then a crash. On awaking, Dr.\r\nSimpson’s first perception was mental. ‘This is far stronger and better\r\nthan ether,’ said he to himself. His second was to note that he was\r\nprostrate on the floor, and that among the friends about him there\r\nwas both confusion and alarm.” Each of the investigators related his\r\nexperience of the new drug, and the experiments were repeated, always,\r\nhowever, on this first occasion, stopping short of unconsciousness.\r\nThey were all convinced that the new agent had full anæsthetic power\r\nwhen pushed. Thus was it satisfactorily proved that chloroform was\r\nsomething much better than ether. Dr. Simpson continued to pursue his\r\nexperiments upon himself until he had perfected the method he had so\r\nhappily discovered.\r\n\r\nA curious incident connected with anæsthesia is mentioned by Dr. Paris\r\nin his well-known work _Pharmacologia_.[1036] He relates an anecdote\r\nwhich he heard from the poet Coleridge, which illustrates the curative\r\ninfluence of the imagination.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the powers of nitrous oxide were discovered, Dr. Beddoes at\r\nonce concluded that it must necessarily be a specific for paralysis;\r\na patient was selected for the trial, and the management of it was\r\nintrusted to Sir Humphry Davy. Previous to the administration of the\r\ngas, he inserted a small pocket thermometer under the tongue of the\r\npatient, as he was accustomed to do upon such occasions, to ascertain\r\nthe degree of animal temperature, with a view to future comparison.\r\nThe paralytic man, wholly ignorant of the nature of the process to\r\nwhich he was to submit, but deeply impressed, from the representation\r\nof Dr. Beddoes, with the certainty of its success, no sooner felt\r\nthe thermometer under his tongue than he concluded the _talisman_\r\nwas in full operation, and in a burst of enthusiasm declared that he\r\nalready experienced the effect of its benign influence throughout his\r\nwhole body. The opportunity was too tempting to be lost; Davy cast an\r\nintelligent glance at Coleridge, and desired his patient to renew his\r\nvisit on the following day, when the same ceremony was performed, and\r\nrepeated every succeeding day for a fortnight, the patient gradually\r\nimproving during that period, when he was dismissed as cured, no other\r\napplication having been used.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL LITERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe greatest historians of medicine are the Germans. Especially\r\nvaluable are the works of—\r\n\r\nKURT P. J. SPRENGEL (1766-1833), of Pomerania, professor of medicine at\r\nHalle. He was a great botanist, but his immortal work on the History of\r\nMedicine eclipsed all his other labours for medical science.\r\n\r\nHEINRICH HAESER (1811-1885), the author of the learned _Lehrbuch der\r\nGeschichte der Medicin und der Epidemischen Krankheiten_, which is one\r\nof the most popular works of this class.\r\n\r\nDR. JOH. HERMANN BAAS, who is the author of the valuable and\r\nencyclopædic _Grundriss der Geschichte der Medicin_, excellently\r\ntranslated into English by Dr. H. E. Handerson, of Cleveland, Ohio\r\n(1889).\r\n\r\nDR. THEO. PUSCHMANN’S _History of Medical Education_ has recently been\r\ntranslated into English by Mr. E. H. Hare (1891).\r\n\r\nAmongst those of our own countrymen who have rendered great services to\r\nmedical literature are—\r\n\r\nSIR CHARLES HASTINGS (1794-1866), the founder of the British Medical\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nSIR CHARLES SCUDAMORE (1779-1849), one of the greatest authorities on\r\ngout, who popularised Hydro-therapeutics by his writings.\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN FORBES (1787-1861), founder of the Sydenham Society.\r\n\r\nSIR RICHARD QUAIN, M.D., editor of the Dictionary of Medicine which\r\nbears his name.\r\n\r\nMR. ERNEST HART (born 1836), editor (since 1866) of the _British\r\nMedical Journal_, which, by his great literary ability and scientific\r\nknowledge, has become the chief agent in the advancement of the\r\nBritish Medical Association to its present proud position amongst the\r\nscientific societies of the empire. Mr. Hart has rendered great public\r\nservices in improving the condition of the sick poor in workhouses,\r\nand the creation of the metropolitan asylums. Mr. Hart’s labours in\r\nconnection with many questions of social and sanitary progress have\r\nbeen pre-eminently crowned with success.\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSING REFORM.\r\n\r\nWhen the nineteenth century had run half its course, FLORENCE\r\nNIGHTINGALE (born 1820) was providentially raised up to reform the\r\nworking of hospitals, schools, and reformatory institutions, after\r\nthe mismanagement of our military hospitals in the Crimea had led to\r\nterrible suffering amongst our wounded soldiers. Her noble devotion\r\nand self-sacrifice amongst the troops earned her the blessing of the\r\nnation, and her name will for ever be gratefully remembered in all\r\nquestions connected with hospital reform and the improvement of nursing.\r\n\r\nMRS. WARDROPER (died 1892), the exterminator of Mrs. Gamp and her\r\nsisterhood, made her mark in the Crimean War, and put her finger on\r\nsome of the most flagrant abuses of the nursing system of the day. She\r\nwas the first superintendent of the Nightingale School of Nursing, and\r\nthe original trainer of technically educated nurses for hospitals and\r\ninfirmaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREATMENT OF INSANITY.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to divide the treatment of the insane into three\r\nperiods—the barbaric, humane, and remedial. We must not, however,\r\nsuppose that in ancient times the treatment was everywhere barbaric,\r\nand that only in recent times has it become humane and remedial;\r\nnothing could be further from the truth. The treatment of persons\r\nmentally afflicted in ancient Egypt and in Greece was not only humane,\r\nbut was probably remedial. In the temples of Saturn in Egypt, and in\r\nthe Asclepia of Greece, which were resorted to by lunatics, Dr. J. B.\r\nTuke thinks[1037] the treatment was identical in principle with that of\r\nthe present day. He praises the sound principles on which Hippocrates\r\nand Galen treated insane patients, and there is no doubt that it was\r\ndirected towards a cure. With these exceptions little is known as to\r\nthe treatment of the insane before the advent of Christianity. The\r\nearliest recorded case of the administration of medicine to an insane\r\npatient is that in which Melampus was the physician, and the neglect\r\nof the worship of Bacchus the cause of the malady. As Mr. Burdett well\r\nremarks,[1038] nowadays the worship of Bacchus is responsible for\r\nmuch of the insanity which exists. From several accounts in the Greek\r\npoets we may assume that insanity prevailed in classic times in the\r\nforms with which we are now familiar. Hippocrates adopted a peculiar\r\ntreatment in cases of suicidal mania. “Give the patient a draught made\r\nfrom the root of mandrake, in a smaller dose than will induce mania.”\r\nHe remarks that although the general rule of treatment be “contraria\r\ncontrariis curantur,” the opposite rule also holds good in some cases,\r\nnamely, “similia similibus curantur.” It is evident therefore that in\r\nsome degree the Father of Medicine was in accord with Homœopathy.[1039]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the practice of the ancients, it is certain that\r\nin the Middle Ages the treatment of lunatics, up to the middle of the\r\nlast century, was simply disgraceful. Little or no effort was made to\r\ncure or even to take proper care of the mentally afflicted. Some few\r\nwere lodged in monastic houses, many in the common jails. In 1537 a\r\nhouse in Bishopsgate Street came into the possession of the Corporation\r\nof London, and was used to confine fifty lunatics. This was the first\r\nBethlehem Hospital; it was removed in 1675 to Moorfields, and in 1814\r\nthe present hospital was built in St. George’s Fields. St. Luke’s was\r\ninstituted in 1751.[1040] Many lunatics were executed as criminals\r\nor witches. It was not till the efforts of Pinel, Tuke, and Conolly\r\nwere directed to the proper care and treatment of the insane that the\r\nbarbarous period of European practice in regard to lunacy was happily\r\nended.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett says:[1041] “The Germans seem to have excelled all other\r\nnations in the ingenuity of the torture which they sought to inflict\r\nupon their patients. Some of them advocated the use of machinery, by\r\nwhich a patient, on first entering an asylum, was to be first drawn\r\nwith frightful clangour over a metal bridge across a moat, and then to\r\nbe suddenly raised to the top of a tower, and as suddenly lowered into\r\na dark and subterraneous cavern. These practitioners avowed, according\r\nto Conolly, that if a patient could be lowered so as to alight among\r\nsnakes and serpents, it would be better still.” “One humane doctor\r\ninvented an excruciating form of torture in the shape of a pump, worked\r\nby four men, which projected a stream of water with great force down\r\nthe spine of the patient, who was firmly fixed in a bath made for\r\nthis apparatus.” Patients were taken to a bath in the ordinary way\r\nand allowed to bathe, but the bath had a bottom which gave way under\r\ntheir weight and plunged them into “the bath of surprise” underneath.\r\nDr. Darwin is credited with having invented “the circulating swing”\r\nfor lunatics; it was worked by a windlass, and was capable of being\r\nrevolved a hundred times a minute. Esquirol approves this horrible\r\ninstrument of torture, and speaks of it as having passed from the arts\r\ninto medicine. Terror, cold water, shower baths, horrible noises,\r\nsmells, darkness, were employed by the faculty in the treatment of\r\ninsanity up to the beginning of the nineteenth century. The leaders of\r\nthe French Revolution added starvation to the treatment. In England,\r\nin 1846, the diet in some of the licensed houses was starvation fare.\r\nCruelty was identical in form in all the countries of Europe. Esquirol,\r\nin 1818, said the insane were either naked or in rags, no bedding was\r\nallowed but a little straw, the stone cells were dark and damp, and\r\nthe wretched patients were chained in caves not good enough for wild\r\nbeasts. They wore iron collars and belts, and had no medical treatment\r\nbut baths of surprise and occasional floggings. Even up to 1850 this\r\nstate of things still existed in England.\r\n\r\nIn England, in 1820, one of the great sights of London was Bedlam. The\r\nkeepers were allowed to add to their income by exhibiting the patients\r\nat one penny or twopence per head.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the chief reason of the neglect and cruelty to which\r\nlunatics were thus subjected in Christian Europe, so long fruitful\r\nin all other works of mercy, was the theory of possession by an evil\r\nspirit; conjurations and exorcisms were considered the only safe and\r\nefficacious methods of expelling the demons. This grievous blunder is\r\none of many illustrations which might be given of the necessity of\r\nmaking an accurate diagnosis before attempting to treat disease. Dr.\r\nBaas says[1042] that lunatic asylums were established first at Feltre\r\nin Italy. The next were those of Seville, established in 1409; Padua,\r\n1410; Saragossa, 1425; Toledo, 1483; Fez, 1492.\r\n\r\nBurton, in his _Anatomy of Melancholy_, thus describes Lycanthropy,\r\n“which Avicenna calls _cucubuth_, others _lupinam insaniam_, or\r\nwolf-madness, when men run howling about graves and fields in the\r\nnight, and will not be persuaded but that they are wolves or some\r\nsuch beasts. _Ætius_ (lib. 6, cap. 11) and _Paulus_ (lib. 3, cap.\r\n16) call it a kind of _melancholy_; but I should rather refer it to\r\n_madness_, as most do. Some make a doubt of it, whether there be any\r\nsuch disease. _Donat. ab Altomari_ (cap. 9, Art. Med.) saith, that he\r\nsaw two of them in his time. _Wierus_ (De Præstiv. Demonum, l. 3, cap.\r\n21) tells a story of such a one at Padua, 1541, that would not believe\r\nto the contrary but that he was a wolf. He hath another instance of a\r\nSpaniard who thought himself a bear. _Forestus_ (Observat. lib. 10, de\r\nMorbis Cerebri, c. 15) confirms as much by many examples; one among the\r\nrest, of which he was an eye-witness, at Alcmaer, in Holland. A poor\r\nhusbandman that still hunted about graves, and kept in churchyards,\r\nof a pale, black, ugly, and fearful look. Such belike, or little\r\nbetter, were King Prœtus’ daughters (_Hippocrates_, lib. de insaniâ),\r\nthat thought themselves kine; and Nebuchadnezzar, in Daniel, as some\r\ninterpreters hold, was only troubled with this kind of madness. This\r\ndisease, perhaps, gave occasion to that bold assertion of Pliny (lib.\r\n8, cap. 22, homines interdum lupos fieri; et contra), _some men were\r\nturned into wolves in his time, and from wolves to men again_: and\r\nto that fable of Pausanias, of a man that was ten years a wolf, and\r\nafterwards turned to his former shape; to Ovid’s (Met. lib. 1) tale\r\nof Lycaon, etc. He that is desirous to hear of this disease, or more\r\nexamples, let him read _Austin_ in his eighteenth book, _de Civitate\r\nDei_, cap. 5,” etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE GERM THEORY OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\n The Disease-Demon reappears as a Germ.—Phagocytes.—Ptomaines.—Lister’s\r\n Antiseptic Surgery.—Sanitary Science or\r\n Hygiene.—Bacteriologists.—Faith Cures.—Experimental Physiology and the\r\n Latest System of Medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after the discovery of the microscope, men began to seek for\r\nthe causes of diseases in the infinitely little. ATHANASIUS KIRCHER\r\n(1598-1680), a Jesuit priest of Fulda, seems to have been gifted\r\nwith the ability to foresee three of our greatest modern scientific\r\ndiscoveries. He anticipated Darwin’s dictum that life is maintained\r\nby struggle and counter-struggle. He described hypnotism in certain\r\nanimals, and detected, as he thought, micro-organisms with the\r\nmicroscope, then in its infancy, in the blood and pus of patients\r\nsuffering with the plague and other infectious diseases, which\r\n“worms,” as he termed the corpuscles, he considered to be the cause\r\nof the disease. His instrument had enabled him to discover that all\r\ndecomposing substances swarmed with low forms of life. His theory,\r\nhowever, gained little credence at the time.[1043] Next ANTONY VAN\r\nLEEUWENHOEK, “the father of microscopy,” in 1675 published his\r\nresearches in a series of letters to the Royal Society, in which he\r\ndescribed minute organisms in waters, vegetable infusions, saliva, and\r\nin scrapings from the teeth, and he was able to differentiate these\r\nspecial forms of life. Some of his descriptions are so graphic that\r\nmicroscopists can almost recognise these forms as bacteria with which\r\nwe are now familiar. Physicians still designating these as “worms”\r\nbegan to attribute to their influence various diseases.\r\n\r\nIn 1701 NICHOLAS ANDRY wrote on this subject a treatise entitled _De\r\nla Génération des Vers dans le Corps de l’Homme_. The germ theory of\r\nputrefaction and fermentation originated with Andry; he maintained\r\nthat air, water, vinegar, fermenting wine, old beer, and sour milk\r\ncontained myriads of germs; he detected these in the blood and pustules\r\nof small-pox, and believed that they could be found in other maladies.\r\nHis views met with general acceptance, and curiously enough it was\r\nbelieved—and has since been verified by our own observation—that\r\nmercurial preparations were fatal to such disease germs.[1044]\r\nLANCISI in 1718 attributed the unhealthy effects of malarial air to\r\nanimalcules, and “inconceivable worms” met with as much ridicule in\r\nParis in 1726 as the “microbe” has been received with to-day. Linnæus\r\nout of all this chaos thought order might possibly be evolved; he\r\nbelieved that the actual contagion of certain eruptive diseases might\r\nbe discovered in these small living beings.\r\n\r\nMARCUS ANTONIUS PLENCIZ in 1762 discussed the relation of animalcules\r\nto putrefaction and disease in his works.[1045]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these clear indications, which, if followed up,\r\nwould have been fertile in result, the germ theory of disease fell\r\nalmost into oblivion. OTTO MÜLLER in 1786 began a more systematic study\r\nof the life history of various micro-organisms, and thus advanced the\r\nscience of minute forms of life. The question arose, How do these forms\r\noriginate? Dr. Needham was the first to suggest the theory of their\r\nspontaneous generation. Bonnet, of Geneva, disputed the results of Dr.\r\nNeedham’s experiments, and Spallanzani demonstrated by experiment the\r\ncorrectness of Bonnet’s criticism.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS SCHULZE in 1836, by a carefully devised experiment, struck\r\nanother blow at Needham’s theory of spontaneous generation. In 1837\r\nSCHWANN convinced himself that the cause of decomposition must exist in\r\nthe air. SCHROEDER and VAN DUSCH in 1854 proved that filtration of the\r\nair through cotton-wool was effectual in excluding germs. Then HOFFMAN\r\nin 1860, and CHEVREUIL and PASTEUR working independently in 1861,\r\nshowed that a sterile solution could be kept sterile if the neck of\r\nthe vessel were bent in the form of an S, so that the micro-organisms\r\nin the air entering the neck of the flask, would be deposited by\r\ngravitation in the curve.\r\n\r\nBut the advocates of the theory of spontaneous generation were not yet\r\nsatisfied. They objected that by the boiling of the infusions, etc.,\r\nunder examination they lost the ability to become decomposed; but it\r\nwas shown that the admission of unfiltered air set up decomposition.\r\nPASTEUR, BURDON SANDERSON, and LISTER next showed that blood, urine,\r\nand milk would not decompose if proper precautions were taken to avoid\r\ncontamination. In 1872 CHARLTON BASTIAN endeavoured to rehabilitate the\r\nspontaneous generation theory, but TYNDALL effectually disposed of his\r\ncontentions. It is settled that bacteria, or microbes, as these germs\r\nare now called, when once destroyed by heat and by certain chemical\r\nagents in any medium, cannot be resuscitated, and that Harvey’s axiom,\r\n_omne vivum ex ovo_, applies to all forms of organisms. As DR. SIMS\r\nWOODHEAD has said[1046] concerning the battle between the advocates and\r\nopponents of the spontaneous generation theory:—\r\n\r\n“The triumphs of surgery, of preventive inoculation of hygiene\r\nin relation to specific infective diseases, of preservation of\r\nfood, have had their origin in the knowledge gained during the\r\nbattle which waged round the question of spontaneous generation or\r\n_generatio æquivoca_; and to the disciples of that school every\r\nacknowledgment must be made and due credit assigned for the attitude\r\nof scepticism, and free, ingenious, and honest criticism which they\r\npassed concerning half-formed and inadequately-supported theories and\r\nimperfectly-conducted experiments, for to their efforts is certainly\r\ndue the fact that the experiments of their opponents became more and\r\nmore perfect, and if to-day we have perfect methods of sterilization\r\nand of making pure cultivations, it is because nothing was taken for\r\ngranted, and because able men on both sides of the controversy were\r\nranged against one another to fight the matter to the death.”\r\n\r\nAnother question which had to be determined was whether these\r\norganisms were of the animal or vegetable kingdom. EHRENBERG came to\r\nthe conclusion that in consequence of snake-like and rotary movements\r\nof certain micro-organisms they were animals; and this opinion held\r\nits ground till DAVAINE decided that bacteria must be considered as\r\nbelonging to the vegetable kingdom. Up to 1852 the animal theory was\r\nunshaken; in 1854 COHN demonstrated the plant nature of bacteria.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 NAEGELI made a group of all the forms of lesser minute\r\norganisms, and termed it Schizomycetes, or fission fungi. The\r\nconnection between micro-organisms and disease was the subject of\r\nresearch also in another direction. The discovery by LATUM and SCHWANN\r\nin 1837, that the yeast plant is a living organism, and the true cause\r\nof fermentation, threw great light on the whole inquiry. Many observers\r\nhad long recognised the likeness of certain diseases to fermentation\r\nprocesses, and it gradually became the opinion that such diseases were\r\nsimilarly produced. In 1837 BASSI discovered that the silk-worm disease\r\nwas due to microscopic spores on the bodies of sick worms, and that\r\nhealthy worms became diseased when these spores were conveyed to them.\r\nHENLE in 1840 declared that all contagious diseases must be caused by\r\nthe growth of something of a living nature, although he had searched\r\nin vain for the living contagion of small-pox and scarlet fever.\r\nWhen fungi were found to be the cause of favus, herpes tonsurans, and\r\npityriasis versicolor, the theory received a still greater impetus.\r\nSWAINE, BRITTAN, and BUDD found micro-organisms in connection with\r\ncholera. In 1857 PASTEUR demonstrated that lactic, acetic, and butyric\r\nfermentations were produced by micro-organisms.[1047] In 1863 DAVAINE\r\ncame to the conclusion that the disease known as splenic fever is\r\ncaused by an organised being which kills the animal by multiplying\r\nin its blood, and so changing its nature, after the manner of a\r\nfermentation process. PASTEUR next took up the investigation of\r\nsilk-worm disease, and was ultimately able to confirm the opinion that\r\nthe disease was due to micro-organisms, and to devise a remedy for it.\r\n\r\nROBERT KOCH in 1877 described the life-history of the bacillus of\r\nanthrax or splenic fever. PASTEUR also devoted much attention to the\r\nsame subject, and confirmed the observations of Koch. PAUL BERT,\r\non the other hand, argued that the bacilli were of no importance.\r\nUltimately he was convinced of his error by Pasteur; it was, however,\r\nsays PROFESSOR CRUIKSHANK,[1048] “principally the researches of Koch\r\nwhich placed the doctrine of contagium vivum on a scientific basis.\r\nKoch elevated the theory of contagium vivum to a demonstrated and\r\nestablished fact.”\r\n\r\nThe whole matter is beset with fallacies. Because certain bacteria have\r\nbeen discovered in the blood of animals suffering from a particular\r\ndisease, it must not be rashly concluded that these bacteria are\r\nalways its cause, they may be in some cases only its effects. At the\r\npresent time the nature of the contagion in many diseases, such as\r\nhydrophobia, variola, vaccinia, scarlet fever, and measles, has not\r\nbeen discovered. The comma-bacillus is associated with cholera in\r\nsome mysterious manner, yet experimenters have swallowed myriads of\r\ncomma-bacilli, and have remained never the worse. Although Pasteur’s\r\nprophylactic treatment against hydrophobia is based upon the theory\r\nthat a micro-organism is the cause of the disease, Pasteur has never\r\nyet discovered the bacterium of hydrophobia, yet there would seem to\r\nbe one. DR. SIMS WOODHEAD says:[1049] “It is a most remarkable fact\r\nthat although no micro-organisms can be found in the virus, filtration\r\nthrough the Pasteur filter keeps back the effective part of the virus,\r\nwhilst heating to 100°C. destroys the activity of the virus.”\r\n\r\nThe disease-demon has now reappeared in the form of a germ.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHAGOCYTE THEORY.\r\n\r\nSome thirty-six diseases, many of which are amongst the most terrible\r\nwhich afflict men and animals, are attributed by bacteriologists to\r\nmicro-organisms.[1050] It is sufficiently alarming to reflect that\r\nenemies which can only be detected by a specialist armed with a\r\npowerful microscope are everywhere around us, waiting to attack us in a\r\nfavourable spot, and slay us without hope of escape.\r\n\r\nYet the germ-theorists have not left us entirely without hope. One\r\nof Pasteur’s most distinguished pupils, M. METSCHNIKOFF, offers us\r\nsalvation through faith in his phagocytes. The white blood corpuscles\r\nare for ever on the watch for the incursions of disease germs.\r\nThese they instantly arrest and imprison by taking them into their\r\nown substance, digesting and converting them to their own uses.\r\nWhenever there is an extra demand for the services of these admirable\r\nblood-police, a large number are attracted to the point where the\r\nburglarious and murderous enemy has entrenched himself; and if the\r\nsystem is in a position to maintain a sufficient force of these\r\nguardians of health, the enemy is rapidly digested, and the effete\r\nproducts are expelled by the regular physiological channels.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that men and animals may be insusceptible to an\r\ninfective disease by natural immunity. Not all persons subjected to\r\nexposure to epidemic diseases contract them. Ordinary sheep readily\r\nsuccumb to anthrax, but Algerian sheep resist any but large doses of\r\nthe virus.[1051] Acquired immunity is that by which one attack, say of\r\nmeasles or of small-pox, protects against a second. Acclimatization\r\nalso affords immunity. Pasteur, in his researches on fowl cholera,\r\nnoticed that in non-fatal cases the disease did not recur. This set\r\nhim to work out a theory of attenuated inoculations which should\r\nafford protection by giving the disease in a mild form in cultivations\r\nof the micro-organism. Pasteur next endeavoured to protect animals\r\nagainst anthrax by inoculating them with a mitigated virus. His\r\nresults were criticised and his researches opposed by Koch, who\r\ncame to the conclusion that the process did not admit of practical\r\napplication, chiefly because the immunity would only last a year, and\r\non account of the danger of disseminating a vaccine of the necessary\r\nstrength.[1052] The theory of protective inoculation in hydrophobia\r\nhas been much discussed. Pasteur’s explanation does not entirely\r\nsatisfy some experts. Dr. Sims Woodhead gives the following: “I am\r\ninclined to think that the explanation advanced by Wood and myself,\r\nthat the treatment consists essentially in causing the tissues to\r\nacquire a tolerance before the microbe has had time to develop, is\r\nmore in accordance with the facts. The tissue cells are acted upon by\r\nincreasingly active virus, each step of which acclimatizes the cells\r\nfor the next stronger virus, until at length, when the virus formed by\r\nthe micro-organisms introduced at the time of the bite comes to exert\r\nits action, the tissues have been so far altered or acclimatized that\r\nthey can continue their work undisturbed in its presence; and treating\r\nthe micro-organisms themselves as foreign bodies, destroy them. When\r\nthe cells are _suddenly_ attacked by a _strong dose_ of the poison\r\nof this virus, they are so paralysed that the micro-organisms can\r\ncontinue to carry on their poison-manufacturing process without let or\r\nhindrance; but when the cells are gradually, though rapidly, accustomed\r\nto the presence of the poison by the exhibition of constantly\r\nincreasing doses, they can carry on their scavenging work even in its\r\npresence, and the micro-organisms are destroyed, possibly even before\r\nthey can exert their full poison-manufacturing powers.”[1053]\r\n\r\n\r\nPTOMAINES.\r\n\r\nThe germ theory has thrown great light upon the subject of certain\r\nmysterious organic poisoning processes, which long puzzled analysts\r\nand physicians. Diseased meat, fish, cheese, and other articles of\r\nfood frequently cause symptoms of poisoning in those who have partaken\r\nof them. The analyst failed to detect the precise agent which caused\r\nthe mischief, and it was not till the bacteriologists investigated\r\nthe subject that it was satisfactorily explained. In 1814, BURROWS\r\ndescribed a poisonous substance in decaying fish. In 1820, KERNER\r\ndescribed a poisonous alkaloid which he discovered in sausages. In\r\n1856, PANUM isolated a poison from some decomposing animal matter.\r\nZUELZA and SONNENSCHEIN from the same substance obtained a poison which\r\nclosely resembled atropine in its physiological action. SELMI between\r\n1871 and 1880 described substances which he called cadaveric alkaloids\r\nor ptomaines. Pasteur and others, working in the same direction, have\r\ngreatly advanced our knowledge of these deadly agents. Bacteria are now\r\nknown to have the power to build up deadly substances as they grow in\r\ndead or living animal tissues, just as plants build up poisons in their\r\nown tissues; these substances exert a deadly influence on the nerve\r\ncentres, and hence a cheese bacillus may be as dangerous to human life\r\nas a dose of aconite.\r\n\r\n\r\nLISTER’S ANTISEPTIC SURGERY.\r\n\r\nWhat is commonly known as “Listerism” is a development of the germ\r\ntheory of disease, which has revolutionised the art of surgery by its\r\ndirect and indirect influence. Pus formation, the result of destructive\r\nprocesses which prevent the healing of wounds, was discovered to be\r\ndue to the action of germs falling from the atmosphere on the injured\r\nflesh. LISTER sought to destroy these germs by powerful disinfectants.\r\nThis was the first step in the antiseptic treatment. When carbolic-acid\r\nlotions were applied for this purpose, LISTER discovered that the wound\r\nhealed rapidly. He believed that he had destroyed the micro-organisms\r\nby the carbolic-acid lotions. But LISTER improved on this process, and\r\nseeing how difficult it is to destroy the germs when they have once\r\nentered the tissues, he invented a method whereby they were prevented\r\nfrom gaining admission at all. He fought the micro-organisms in the\r\natmosphere of the operating room, in the dressings, instruments, and\r\nhands of the operator, and thus gradually built up his system of\r\nabsolute surgical cleanliness called antiseptic surgery. Even those\r\nsurgeons who rejected his method in its entirety, and declined to adopt\r\nhis complicated system of dressings, devoted so much attention to the\r\nminutest cleanliness, that they achieved results not less successful\r\nthan those of the inventor of the antiseptic system itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANITARY SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nHygiene, the art of preserving health, has always been recognised\r\nas a branch of medical science, not less important than that which\r\nconcerns itself with the cure of disease. MOSES (B.C. 1490) enjoined\r\nthe strictest cleanliness, and anticipated our modern sanitary laws.\r\nHIPPOCRATES embodied in his works treatises on hygiene, which existed\r\nin Greece probably long anterior to his time. The value of attention\r\nto rules of diet and exercise was recognised by HERODICUS, one of\r\nhis preceptors, who introduced a system of medicinal gymnastics for\r\nthe improvement of the health and the cure of disease. Such rules\r\nmust to a greater or less extent have always been in force in any\r\nwell-constituted army. Gymnasts, athletes, and others must have been\r\nfully aware of the necessity for attending to such rules. Hippocrates,\r\nin his treatise _Airs, Waters, and Places_, has insisted on the duty\r\nof the physician to study the effects of the seasons, the winds, the\r\nposition of cities, and the diseases which are endemic and epidemic\r\nin them, the qualities of waters, and their effects on public health,\r\nand so forth. Had men taken up the study of Hygiene where Hippocrates\r\nleft off, we should not have heard of the plagues, pestilences,\r\nand epidemics which up to modern times periodically devastated the\r\ncivilized world.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYGIENE.\r\n\r\nMr. PARKES, in the introduction to his _Manual of Practical Hygiene_,\r\ndefines hygiene in its largest sense to signify “rules for perfect\r\nculture of mind and body.” The two are not to be dissociated. Every\r\nmental and moral action influences the body; the physical conditions\r\nequally re-act upon the mind. He admirably says: “For a perfect\r\nsystem of hygiene we must combine the knowledge of the physician,\r\nthe schoolmaster, and the priest, and must train the body, the\r\nintellect, and the moral soul in a perfect and balanced order. Then,\r\nif our knowledge were exact, and our means of application adequate,\r\nwe should see the human being in his perfect beauty, as Providence,\r\nperhaps, intended him to be; in the harmonious proportion and complete\r\nbalance of all parts in which he came out of his Maker’s hands, in\r\nwhose divine image, we are told, he was in the beginning made.” Mr.\r\nParkes asks if such a system is possible? He replies that we can even\r\nnow literally choose between health and disease. There are certain\r\nhereditary conditions which we may not be able to avoid, and men may\r\nhinder our acquisition of the boon; but as a race man holds his own\r\ndestiny in his hands, and can choose the good and reject the evil. Exit\r\nthe disease-demon! Fevers and other epidemic diseases are no longer\r\nattributed to the anger of the Supreme Being; they may be prevented.\r\nIf we use the words scourge, plague, visitation, and the like, it\r\nis merely because we recognise that Nature can take offence at our\r\nviolation of her laws, and visit us with the penalty.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important events of our time was the establishment of\r\nthe Registrar-General’s office in 1838. To DR. WILLIAM FARR we owe a\r\nnation’s gratitude for the admirable manner in which he performed the\r\nduties of his office. The Government Inquiry into the Health of Towns\r\nand of the Country generally, undertaken by EDWIN CHADWICK, SOUTHWOOD\r\nSMITH, NEIL ARNOTT, SUTHERLAND, GUY, TOYNBEE, and others, was of\r\nimmense importance to the national health. The medical officer to the\r\nPrivy Council, SIMON, carried on the work thus ably commenced with the\r\ngreatest vigour; and the consequence of the important departure was\r\nthat medical officers of health were appointed to the different towns\r\nand parishes.\r\n\r\nVarious public health acts have followed from time to time, and it has\r\nbeen found, in the words of Mr. Parkes, that “nothing is so costly in\r\nall ways as disease, and that nothing is so remunerative as the outlay\r\nwhich augments health, and in doing so, augments the amount and value\r\nof the work done.”\r\n\r\nIt is a reproach frequently brought against medicine that it makes\r\nlittle advance. Some have even said that in some respects we are no\r\nbetter off than if we lived in the days of Hippocrates. However this\r\nmay be, we may be justly proud of the splendid work which hygienic\r\nmedicine has performed, and we have every reason to look hopefully\r\nforward to the benefits this branch of medical science will confer upon\r\nus in the near future. Hygiene is the outcome of physiology. Until we\r\nknew the laws of life, it was impossible that hygiene should have a\r\nscientific basis; and henceforth physiology and hygiene will go hand in\r\nhand.[1054]\r\n\r\nJOHN SIMON, C.B., F.R.S. (born 1816), the eminent physiologist,\r\npathologist, and surgeon, became the first appointed officer of health\r\nto the City of London. He was for some time medical adviser to the\r\nPrivy Council. He rendered the greatest services to the health of the\r\nnation by his reports and official papers on sanitary matters.\r\n\r\nEDMUND A. PARKES (1819-1876) was the great sanitary reformer whose name\r\nis gratefully enshrined in the “Parkes Museum of Hygiene,” instituted\r\nin 1876, of University College, London.\r\n\r\nLUDWIG J. P. SEMMELWEIS (1818-1865), “the Father of Antiseptic\r\nMidwifery,” was professor in Pesth, and has earned the gratitude of\r\nhis profession and of the whole world by demonstrating that puerperal\r\nfever was due to inoculation, that the poison which caused it was\r\nintroduced by organic matter below the nails and epidermis of the\r\nstudents and doctors who had been engaged in anatomical or pathological\r\nwork and had not taken sufficient pains to disinfect and purify their\r\nhands. He recommended careful washing with chlorine water before each\r\nexamination; the consequence of which was, that the mortality among\r\nlying-in women fell in two months from twelve to three per cent. He\r\nanticipated the methods of Lister, and died in a lunatic asylum, galled\r\nby the attacks which his doctrines experienced.[1055] Sir Andrew\r\nClark said:[1056] “There are few such parallels in the history of\r\nscience, in regard to his tremendous moral heroism; in spite of every\r\nconceivable difficulty, in positions of misrepresentation, in spite\r\nof persecution, he continued his labours, until crowned with a full\r\nclearing up of the difficulties. As to his martyrdom, there is not such\r\na history. The persecution to which he was exposed in the later years\r\nof his stay in Vienna, his being hounded out of Vienna and settling in\r\nBudapest, and his premature end in loss of reason, form indeed a sad\r\nstory, and one of the highest examples that can be presented.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIOLOGISTS AND OTHER SCIENTISTS.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN W. RICHARDSON, M.D., F.R.S., etc. (born 1828). In 1865 he\r\nmade important researches on the nature of the poisons of contagious\r\ndiseases and discovered _septine_. In 1866 he discovered the use of\r\nthe ether spray for locally abolishing pain in surgical operations. He\r\nintroduced bichloride of methylene as an anæsthetic, and discovered the\r\ninfluence of nitrite of amyl over tetanus, angina pectoris, etc. He\r\ninvented the _lethal chamber_ for killing animals without pain, and has\r\nmade many most important researches on the action of alcohol on man. In\r\n1875 he gave a sketch of a “Model City of Health,” to be called Hygeia,\r\nwhich awakened much interest and discussion.\r\n\r\nJOHN BURDON SANDERSON, M.D. (born 1828), Professor of Physiology at\r\nOxford, made investigations respecting the cattle plague, 1865-66.\r\nIn 1883 he sat on the Royal Commission on Hospitals for infectious\r\ndiseases, and has made elaborate researches on animal and plant\r\nelectricity, and on the nature of contagion.\r\n\r\nROBERT KOCH (born 1843), the eminent bacteriologist, the discoverer of\r\nthe “comma” bacillus, and the tubercle bacillus, is Professor of the\r\nInstitute of Hygiene in Berlin.\r\n\r\nJOHN TYNDALL, F.R.S. (born 1820), is one of the foremost of the\r\nscientific explorers of the century. Besides his researches in relation\r\nto magnetism, radiant heat, heat as a mode of motion, light, etc.,\r\nProfessor Tyndall has rendered very important services to medicine\r\nby his studies on _The Floating Matter of the Air in Relation to\r\nPutrification and Infection_, 1881.\r\n\r\nLOUIS PASTEUR (born 1822), chemist, is celebrated for his researches\r\nrelative to the polarization of light, and for his investigations on\r\nfermentation, the preservation of wines, and the propagation of zymotic\r\ndiseases in silkworms and domestic animals. Pasteur’s most important\r\nwork for medicine was the demonstration of the existence of the germs\r\nwhich cause putrefaction.\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Public Instruction, addressing M. Pasteur on the\r\noccasion of his seventieth birthday, summed up what is known as\r\nPasteurism in the following words: “Henceforward the formula is\r\ndefinitive and complete. Your disciples give it in two words—ferments\r\nand virus are living beings; vaccine is an attenuated virus, the basis\r\nof medicine is the artificial attenuation of virus, and thus the\r\nmicrobic treatment is founded.”\r\n\r\nPasteur’s later work has been chiefly in connection with the attempt to\r\ndiscover a prophylactic for hydrophobia.\r\n\r\nLIONEL S. BEALE, F.R.S. (born 1828), physiologist and pathological\r\nanatomist, is a celebrated microscopist, author of _The Microscope in\r\nits Application to Practical Medicine_; _Disease Germs, their Supposed\r\nand Real Nature, and on the Treatment of Diseases caused by their\r\nPresence_; and many other works of equal importance to medical science.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM B. CARPENTER (1812-1885) was a celebrated physiologist, whose\r\ngreat work has done more to popularise the study of physiology amongst\r\nnon-professional, as well as medical readers, than any other, except\r\nthat of Professor Huxley, which followed it.\r\n\r\nAmongst other scientific workers of the century may be mentioned\r\nPURKINJE, who rediscovered and described the bone corpuscles,\r\ncontributed greatly to the study of microscopical anatomy and\r\nophthalmology by his experiments with the ophthalmoscope.\r\n\r\nR. WAGNER (1805-1864) in 1861 called an anthropological congress, which\r\nwas attended by several distinguished anatomists, and thus originated\r\nthe “Anthropological Congress.”\r\n\r\nPANDER (1794-1865) and BAER (1792-1876) made important researches in\r\nthe history of development. To Baer is due the splendid discovery of\r\nthe mammalian ovum.\r\n\r\nFRANÇOIS MAGENDIE (1782-1855) was the first to introduce the\r\nexperimental method into pathology and pharmacology. His investigations\r\nin what are called pharmaco-dynamics, chiefly connected with the\r\nalkaloids, introduced many of these powerful remedies into medical\r\npractice. He admitted a vital principle in nervous activity, but for\r\nthe rest endeavoured to reduce medicine to mere physiological and\r\nchemical laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRACLES OF HEALING, FAITH CURES, MIND CURES, CHRISTIAN SCIENCE\r\nHEALING, ETC., ETC.\r\n\r\nThere are many things connected with the healing art on which the\r\npublic mind is better informed than the recognised authorities on\r\nmedicine. Mesmerism is now accepted by the faculty under the name\r\nof hypnotism, and the miracles of healing wrought at the shrines of\r\nsaints, long the objects of scorn and contempt at the hands of the\r\nmedical profession, are now declared to be well within the domain\r\nof scientific fact. The miracles of Lourdes, the faith cures at\r\nBethshan, and similar phenomena, having been subjected to the strictest\r\ninvestigation by the most competent medical authorities, are proved to\r\nbe not impostures and delusions, but simple matters of fact. Science\r\nhaving reluctantly accepted the faith-cure, now declares it to be “an\r\nideal method, since it often attains its end when all other means have\r\nfailed.”[1057]\r\n\r\nProfessor Charcot, while declaring that the faith-cure is entirely of a\r\nscientific order, insists that its domain is limited; “to produce its\r\neffects it must be applied to those cases which demand for their cure\r\nno intervention beyond the power which the mind has over the body.”\r\nThat is to say, faith will cure paralysis and other disorders of motion\r\nand sensation dependent on idea, but does not avail to restore a lost\r\norgan or an amputated limb.\r\n\r\nProfessor Charcot believes also that the faith-cure may cause ulcers\r\nand tumours to disappear, if such lesions be of the same nature as the\r\nparalysis cured by the same means. In all this there is no miracle.\r\nThe diseases are all of hysterical origin, according to this eminent\r\nauthority, and being purely dynamic, and not organic, the mind has\r\npower to influence and cure them. The mind of the invalid becomes\r\npossessed of the overpowering idea that a cure is to be effected, and\r\nit is so.\r\n\r\nM. Littré has explained for us how this happens.[1058] The mind, which\r\nis most eminently receptive of suggestion, will be the most likely to\r\nbe influential in curing the body in which it is enshrined, by the\r\npowerful force of auto-suggestion.[1059]\r\n\r\nIn expressing this opinion, no question need arise of the efficacy\r\nof prayer or of the intervention of the Divine power. The aim of the\r\nphysician is to understand the medical side of the subject, and science\r\nis daily becoming more capable of offering an explanation of such\r\nphenomena from a purely medical point of view. A curious instance of\r\nfaith-cure was recently given in a Catholic magazine.\r\n\r\nThe _Month_ for June, 1892, published an account, by the late Earl\r\nof Denbigh, of a cure worked by a member of a family named Cancelli\r\non Lady Denbigh in 1850. She was suffering severely from rheumatism,\r\nand the Pope (Pius IX.) mentioned to the Earl that near Foligno there\r\nwas a family of peasants who were credited with a miraculous power of\r\ncuring rheumatic disorders. Lord Denbigh succeeded in getting one of\r\nthe family, an old man, to come, and learned from him the legend of\r\nthe cure. The belief was that in the reign of Nero, the Apostles Peter\r\nand Paul took refuge in the hut of an old couple named Cancelli, near\r\nFoligno, and as a proof of gratitude, gave to the male descendants of\r\nthe family living near the spot the power of curing rheumatic disorders\r\nto the end of time. Lord Denbigh described how the old man made a\r\nsolemn invocation, using the sign of the cross, and, in fact, Lady\r\nDenbigh did recover at once. In a few days the pains returned, but she\r\nmade an act of resignation, and they then left her, and never returned\r\nwith any acuteness.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe question of vivisection, or experimental physiology, pathology,\r\nand pharmacology, has become a burning one in England and America of\r\nrecent years. In a history of medicine so prominent a question cannot\r\nbe entirely ignored, although it would be out of place to discuss it\r\nhere at length. It has been claimed that almost all our real knowledge\r\nof the healing art, and the most important steps of medical progress,\r\nhave been gained by experiments upon living animals. On the other hand,\r\nit has been maintained by practical physicians and surgeons that the\r\nmethod in question is not less misleading than cruel; that “the only\r\ncorrect path is that of thoughtful experience.”[1060] On behalf of the\r\nadvocates of the experimental method, PROFESSOR MICHAEL FOSTER shall\r\nstate the case; that of the other side shall be given in the words of\r\nSIR ANDREW CLARK, “the prince of physicians, and one of the noblest of\r\nmen,” under whom it was my happiness and privilege to study medicine in\r\nthe wards of the London Hospital.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR MICHAEL FOSTER says: “It would not be a hard task to give\r\nchapter and verse for the assertion that the experimental method\r\nhas, especially in these later times, supplied the chief means of\r\nprogress in physiology; but it would be a long task, and we may content\r\nourselves with calling attention to what is in many respects a typical\r\ncase. We referred a short time back to the phenomena of ‘inhibition.’\r\nIt is not too much to say that the discovery of the inhibitory function\r\nof certain nerves marks one of the most important steps in the progress\r\nof physiology during the past half-century. The mere attainment of\r\nthe fact that the stimulation of a nerve might stop action instead\r\nof inducing action constituted in itself almost a revolution; and\r\nthe value of that fact in helping us on the one hand to unravel the\r\ntangled puzzles of physiological action and reaction, and on the other\r\nhand to push our inquiries into the still more difficult problems of\r\nmolecular changes, has proved immense. One cannot at the present time\r\ntake up a physiological memoir covering any large extent of ground\r\nwithout finding some use made of inhibitory processes for the purpose\r\nof explaining physiological phenomena. Now, however skilfully we\r\nmay read older statements between the lines, no scientific—that is,\r\nno exact—knowledge of inhibition was possessed by any physiologist,\r\nuntil Weber, by a direct experiment on a living animal, discovered\r\nthe inhibitory influence of the pneumogastric nerve over the beating\r\nof the heart. It was, of course, previously known that under certain\r\ncircumstances the beating of the heart might be stopped; but all ideas\r\nas to how the stoppage was, or might be, brought about, were vague and\r\nuncertain before Weber made his experiment. That experiment gave the\r\nclue to an exact knowledge, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to\r\nsee how the clue could have been gained otherwise than by experiment;\r\nother experiments have enabled us to follow up the clue, so that it\r\nmay with justice be said that all that part of the recent progress\r\nof physiology which is due to the introduction of a knowledge of\r\ninhibitory processes is the direct result of the experimental method.\r\nBut the story of our knowledge of inhibition is only one of the\r\ninnumerable instances of the value of this method. In almost every\r\ndepartment of physiology, an experiment, or a series of experiments,\r\nhas proved a turning-point at which vague, nebulous fancies were\r\nexchanged for clear, decided knowledge, or a starting-point for the\r\nintroduction of wholly new and startling ideas.\r\n\r\n“And we may venture to repeat, that not only must the experimental\r\nmethod be continued, but the progress of physiology will chiefly depend\r\non the increased application of that method. The more involved and\r\nabstruse the problems become, the more necessary does it also become\r\nthat the inquirer should be able to choose his own conditions for the\r\nobservations he desires to make. Happily, the experimental method\r\nitself brings with it in the course of its own development the power\r\nof removing the only valid objection to physiological experiments,\r\nviz., that in certain cases they involve pain and suffering. For in\r\nnearly all experiments pain and suffering are disturbing elements.\r\nThese disturbing elements the present imperfect methods are often\r\nunable to overcome; but their removal will become a more and more\r\npressing necessity in the interests of the experiments themselves,\r\nas the science becomes more exact and exacting, and will also become\r\na more and more easy task as the progress of the science makes the\r\ninvestigator more and more master of the organism. In the physiology of\r\nthe future, pain and suffering will be admissible in an experiment only\r\nwhen pain and suffering are themselves the object of inquiry. And such\r\nan inquiry will of necessity take a subjective rather than an objective\r\nform.”[1061]\r\n\r\nLet the President of the Royal College of Physicians give his views\r\nof the utility of vivisection from the point of view of a practical\r\nphysician:—\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW CLARK before the “Clinical Society of London” (_British\r\nMedical Journal_, Feb. 3, 1883) said: “For whatever purpose they\r\nmay be employed; however carefully they may be designed and executed;\r\nhowever successful may be the precautions taken to exclude error,\r\nexperiments have their subtle difficulties and dangers which are\r\nperilous to truth, and cannot be wholly averted. By the prestige\r\nof precision, which often undeservedly they profess, undue weight\r\nis attached to their results; and by the assumption that in like\r\nconditions the results would be the same in man as in the lower\r\nanimals, flagrant errors are committed, and currency is given to false\r\nor inadequate generalisations. The experimenter interprets the results\r\nof his experiments by the light of their structural results; he forgets\r\nor he ignores the life-history of the processes by which they have\r\nbeen evolved, and he takes no account of the fact, beyond controversy,\r\nthat different clinical states find occasionally the same structural\r\nexpression. In such circumstances doubt is inevitable, and it is only\r\nto clinical medicine that any just appeal for its solution can be made.\r\nTo her, at last, all such experiments must be brought for trial; she\r\nmust be their examiner, critic, interpreter, user, and judge. And no\r\nresults of experiments can be made of any avail to medicine, or be used\r\nwith safety in her service, until they have been filtered through the\r\nchecks and counter-checks of clinical experience, and have responded\r\nto the tests and counter-tests of clinical trial. Had these principles\r\nexerted their just influence in the recent debates concerning questions\r\nof this kind, we should not have had a seton in the neck of a man taken\r\nas the parallel of a seton in the neck of a guinea-pig; we should\r\nnot have had the artificial tuberculosis of the rodent pronounced to\r\nbe identical with the natural tuberculosis of the child; we should\r\nnot have had grey tubercles and caseous pneumonias pronounced on the\r\ngrounds of mere likeness of structure to be of one and the same nature;\r\nand we should have been spared the sight of science, drunken with\r\nsuccess and drivelling with prophecies, soliciting the public on the\r\ncommon highway.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n_ON SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT MINERALS USED IN MEDICINE._\r\n\r\n(Compiled chiefly from Royle’s _Materia Medica_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONATE OF SODA is the _neter_ of the Hebrews. It was known to the\r\nearly Hindus, and is by them called _Sajji noon_ (_i.e._ Sajji or Soda\r\nSalt); it is the Sagimen vitri of Geber. The Natron lakes of Egypt\r\nwere known to the ancients, and it was early employed in glass making,\r\netc. (Royle). On the shores of the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, and the\r\nMediterranean, plants of the order _Chenopodeæ_ are burned to form the\r\nash called Barilla, and from this ash soda is obtained. Carbonate of\r\nsoda was also formerly prepared on the coasts of Scotland, Ireland,\r\nWales, and Normandy, by burning algæ or sea-weeds, and the ash so\r\nobtained was called _kelp_. There is no doubt that the process is\r\nextremely ancient, and the discovery of the properties of these ashes\r\naccidental.\r\n\r\nCHLORIDE OF SODIUM, or common salt, is so universally distributed that\r\nit must have been known and used in food from the earliest ages.\r\n\r\nBORAX is thought to have been the Chrysocolla of Pliny. It is the\r\n_Sohaga_ of the Hindus (Sanscrit, _Tincana_), and is called _Booruk_ by\r\nthe Arabs. It is abundant on the shores of some of the lakes in Thibet,\r\nand was brought into India across the Himalayas (Royle).\r\n\r\nSULPHATE OF SODA, or Glauber’s Salt, is found on the soil in India and\r\nother countries, and exists in the ashes of many plants, in mineral\r\nsprings, and in sea-water.\r\n\r\nLIME was known to the Egyptians and Hindus.\r\n\r\nMAGNESIA seems to have been known to the alchemists. Its name occurs\r\nin Geber and other writers of the period. The CARBONATE OF MAGNESIA\r\nwas probably first used as a medicine by the Count de Palma at Rome.\r\nHoffmann introduced it into the list of Materia Medica.\r\n\r\nEPSOM SALTS (SULPHATE OF MAGNESIA) was first discovered by Dr. Grew in\r\n1675 in a spring at Epsom. It is found in many countries.\r\n\r\nALUM is mentioned in _Pliny_, xxxv. chap. 15, and probably is referred\r\nto by _Dioscorides_ (v. chap. 122). _Shib_ was the generic term of alum\r\nof various kinds in Arab writings. Egyptians and Hindus must have known\r\nof its properties from the earliest ages of their civilization. It was\r\nintroduced into Europe from Syria by the Genoese.\r\n\r\n_Green Vitriol_ or _Sulphate of Iron_ was known to the ancients. It is\r\nmentioned, says Dr. Royle, in the _Amera Cosha_ of the Hindus (_Hind.\r\nMed._, p. 44), and it is used by them as by the Romans in the time of\r\nPliny in making ink.\r\n\r\nZINC seems to have been first made known as a metal in Europe by\r\nParacelsus. The Hindus have imported it from China from remote times.\r\nThe Oxide of Zinc was anciently called tutty, probably from the Tamil\r\nTutanagum. In the East, says Royle, SULPHATE OF ZINC is called _suffed\r\ntutia_, or white tutia, the Sulphates of Iron and Copper being called\r\n_green_ and _blue tutia_ (_Hindu Med._, p. 100).\r\n\r\nCOPPER was one of the metals most anciently known. It was employed\r\nin medicine by the Hindus and Arabs in the form of the Sulphate or\r\nBlue-stone. VERDIGRIS, the DIACETATE OF COPPER, must have been known\r\nwherever copper vessels were used. It was employed by the Greeks as a\r\nmedicine, by the Arabs, and probably also by the Egyptians.\r\n\r\nLEAD was equally well known of old; the carbonate of the metal was one\r\nof the most anciently known of the metallic salts. The Middle Ages\r\nintroduced the acetate of lead commonly known as SUGAR OF LEAD. EXTRACT\r\nOF LEAD, or EXTRACT OF SATURN, or _Goulard’s Extract_, have been known\r\nsince the time of B. Valentine.\r\n\r\nBISMUTH was first mentioned by Agricola in 1520.\r\n\r\nSULPHUR was employed in medicine by the Greeks, Hindus, and Arabs.\r\nGeber knew of its solubility in an alkaline solution, and Albertus\r\nMagnus taught the method of procuring Sulphuret of Potassium by fusion.\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORUS was discovered in 1669, when it was found in the Phosphate\r\nof Soda and Ammonia of Urine by Brandt, an alchemist of Hamburgh.\r\nKnuckel in Germany and Boyle in England had also the credit of\r\ndiscovering it (Royle, _Mat. Med._).\r\n\r\nNITRIC ACID was known to Geber, and probably also to the Hindus (Royle,\r\n_Mat. Med._).\r\n\r\nIODINE was obtained by M. Courtois in 1812 in the residual liquor of\r\nthe process for obtaining soda from sea-weed.\r\n\r\nIODIDE OF POTASSIUM was first employed in medicine by Coindet.\r\n\r\nBROMINE was discovered in 1826 by M. Balard, in _bittern_, the\r\nuncrystallisable residue of sea-water. Bromide of Potassium was first\r\nintroduced into the London Pharmacopœia in 1836.\r\n\r\nSAL AMMONIAC was known to Geber. Avicenna and Serapion mention it\r\nby the name _Noshadur_. Persian writers give _Armeena_ as its Greek\r\nsynonym. The Sanskrit name is _Nuosadur_. In Egypt it is made from\r\ncamel’s dung. It must have been known to the Romans, as Pliny says that\r\none of the kinds of _Nitrum_ gives out a strong smell when mixed with\r\nquicklime (Royle, _Mat. Med._).\r\n\r\nCARBONATE OF POTASH is obtained by the burning of vegetables. It must\r\ntherefore have been known to primitive nations. “Dioscorides describes\r\nit by the name τεφρα κληματινης, or _Cinis sarmentorum_, ashes of vine\r\ntwigs (‘cineris lixivium,’ _Pliny_, xxxviii. chap. 51). The Arabs are\r\nusually supposed to have been the first to make known this alkali\r\n(al-_kali_); but the Hindus, in works from which the Arabs copied, made\r\nuse of the ashes of plants” (Royle, _Mat. Med._).\r\n\r\nTIN was the Bedel of Moses. It was used by the Egyptians, who probably\r\nprocured it from India. The Greeks and Romans obtained it from the\r\nPhœnicians.\r\n\r\nANTIMONY was probably discovered by the Alchemists. The sulphuret of\r\nthe metal, however, is the στιμμι and stibium of the ancients. In Asia\r\nit has been used from time immemorial for painting the eyebrows and\r\neyelids. Several of the Sulphurets of Antimony have long been used\r\nin medicine. The Tartarate (TARTAR EMETIC) is supposed to have been\r\ndiscovered by Mynsicht (Thesaurus, etc., Hamburgh, 1631).\r\n\r\nMERCURY or QUICKSILVER was known to the ancients. It was probably\r\nfirst prescribed internally by the Hindus. The Romans and Arabs used\r\nit externally. Pliny says that mercury is poisonous, “unless, indeed,\r\nit is to be administered in the form of an unction on the belly, when\r\nit will stay bloody fluxes.” The Arabs appear to have re-introduced it\r\ninto the European practice (Royle). The red oxide was known to Geber.\r\nCALOMEL is the subchloride of mercury. It occurs native in Carniola and\r\nin Spain. The Hindus from very early times prepared it artificially and\r\nprescribed it internally. It was introduced into European practice in\r\n1608. BICHLORIDE OF MERCURY, or CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE, is the _ruskapoor_\r\nof the Hindus, to whom, says Royle, it has long been known. It was\r\nknown also by the Chinese, and was prepared by Geber in the eighth\r\ncentury. The, AMMONIO-CHLORIDE of mercury, or WHITE PRECIPITATE, was\r\ndiscovered by Raymond Lully in the thirteenth century. CINNABAR or\r\nVERMILION, the RED SULPHURET OF MERCURY, was known to the Greeks, and\r\nwas one of the pigments employed by the Egyptians. It has been used by\r\nthe Chinese and Hindus in medicine from very early times. The ointment\r\nof mercury killed with oil or fat was used by the Saracens for killing\r\nlice, just as it is used at the present time for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nPreparations of ARSENIC have long been used in medicine. Dioscorides\r\napplies the name Arsenikon (αρσενικον) to the yellow Sulphuret of\r\nArsenic.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs call it _zurneekh_, which is supposed by Sprengel to be\r\na corruption of Arsenikon. They were familiar with the white oxide\r\nwhich they called _sum-al-far_, _mouse poison_ or _rat’s-bane_.\r\nThe Hindus are well acquainted with the form of arsenic known as\r\norpiment, which they call _hurtal_; realgar, which is their _mansil_;\r\nand white arsenic, which they name _sanchya_. Royle thinks it was\r\nfirst prescribed internally by the Hindus, who used it for leprosy\r\nand intermittent fevers. It is a remedy of great value in many kinds\r\nof skin diseases, and is of great use in agues and in all periodic\r\ndisorders, for which it is only inferior to quinine.\r\n\r\nSILVER is supposed to have first been employed in medicine by the\r\nArabs. GOLD was employed by the Greeks and Arabs in medicine, but it is\r\nnot known which were the first to so use it. The Hindus used it long\r\nbefore the alchemists investigated its properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n  Abaris cured diseases by incantation, 203.\r\n\r\n  Abdominal surgery, 112, 197, 272, 296, 316, 361.\r\n\r\n  — surgery of Hindus, 113.\r\n\r\n  Abella (about 1059), 313.\r\n\r\n  Abercrombie, John (1780-1844), 454.\r\n\r\n  Abernethy, J.

From the many references\r\nto disease in this book, it has been supposed by some commentators that\r\nthe author was a physician. The writer of the article on “Medicine,”\r\nin _Smith’s Dictionary of the Bible_, remarks that “if he was so, the\r\npower of mind and wide range of observation shown in this work, would\r\ngive a favourable impression of the standard of practitioners; if he\r\nwas not, the great general popularity of the study and practice may\r\nbe inferred from its thus becoming a common topic of general advice\r\noffered by a non-professional writer.”\r\n\r\n[191] _Wars of the Jews_, Book II. chap, viii; _Antiq._, xviii. 1, 5.\r\n\r\n[192] See Lightfoot on the _Colossians_.\r\n\r\n[193] _Works_, vol. i. p. 10.\r\n\r\n[194] _Ibid._, vol. vii. p. 7.\r\n\r\n[195] _History of Medicine_, p. 36.\r\n\r\n[196] “‘How doth a man revive again in the world to come?’ asked\r\nHadrian; and Joshua Ben Hananiah made answer, ‘From luz in the\r\nbackbone.’ He then went on to demonstrate this to him.

He obeyed, and instantly his\r\nsight was restored, amidst the loud acclamations of the multitude.\r\nThese signs of the omnipotence of the gods were shown in the reign of\r\nAntoninus.”\r\n\r\n“A blind soldier, named Valerius Apes, having consulted the oracle,\r\nwas informed that he should mix the blood of a white cock with honey,\r\nto make up an ointment to be applied to his eyes for three consecutive\r\ndays. He received his sight, and returned public thanks to the gods.”\r\n\r\n“Julian appeared lost beyond all hope from a spitting of blood. The\r\ngods ordered him to take from the altar some seeds of the pine, and\r\nto mix them with honey, of which mixture he was to eat for three\r\ndays. He was saved, and came to thank the gods in presence of the\r\npeople.”—(Smith’s _Dict.

Some\r\ncommentators of great authority think the passage forbids castration,\r\nas disgraceful things are being spoken of, such as giving poisons and\r\nprocuring abortion. Certainly there is no reason for supposing that\r\nthe doctors of the period would object to perform lithotomy though it\r\nis the fact that there was a class of operators who were a sort of\r\nunscientific specialists in the practice.\r\n\r\n[380] Baas, _Hist.
