Little & Ives Co.\r\nNew York\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CREATION OF WOMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThis old Oriental legend is so exquisitely charming, so superior to\r\nthe Biblical narrative of the creation of woman, that it deserves to\r\nbe reproduced in WOMAN: HER SEX AND LOVE LIFE. There are several\r\nvariants of this legend, but I reproduce it as it appeared in the\r\nfirst issue of THE CRITIC AND GUIDE, January, 1903.\r\n\r\n    At the beginning of time, Twashtri--the Vulcan of Hindu\r\n    mythology--created the world. But when he wished to create a\r\n    woman, he found that he had employed all his materials in the\r\n    creation of man. There did not remain one solid element. Then\r\n    Twashtri, perplexed, fell into a profound meditation from which\r\n    he aroused himself and proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n    He took the roundness of the moon, the undulations of the\r\n    serpent, the entwinement of clinging plants, the trembling of\r\n    the grass, the slenderness of the rose-vine and the velvet of\r\n    the flower, the lightness of the leaf and the glance of the\r\n    fawn, the gaiety of the sun's rays and tears of the mist, the\r\n    inconstancy of the wind and the timidity of the hare, the vanity\r\n    of the peacock and the softness of the down on the throat of the\r\n    swallow, the hardness of the diamond, the sweet flavor of honey\r\n    and the cruelty of the tiger, the warmth of fire, the chill of\r\n    snow, the chatter of the jay and the cooing of the turtle dove.\r\n\r\n    He combined all these and formed a woman. Then he made a present\r\n    of her to man. Eight days later the man came to Twashtri, and\r\n    said: \"My Lord, the creature you gave me poisons my existence.\r\n    She chatters without rest, she takes all my time, she laments\r\n    for nothing at all, and is always ill; take her back;\" and\r\n    Twashtri took the woman back.\r\n\r\n    But eight days later the man came again to the god and said: \"My\r\n    Lord, my life is very solitary since I returned this creature. I\r\n    remember she danced before me, singing. I recall how she glanced\r\n    at me from the corner of her eye, how she played with me, clung\r\n    to me. Give her back to me,\" and Twashtri returned the woman to\r\n    him. Three days only passed and Twashtri saw the man coming to\r\n    him again. \"My Lord,\" said he, \"I do not understand exactly how\r\n    it is, but I am sure that the woman causes me more annoyance\r\n    than pleasure. I beg you to relieve me of her.\"\r\n\r\n    But Twashtri cried: \"Go your way and do the best you can.\" And\r\n    the man cried: \"I cannot live with her!\" \"Neither can you live\r\n    without her!\" replied Twashtri.\r\n\r\n    And the man went away sorrowful, murmuring: \"Woe is me, I can\r\n    neither live with nor without her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter of this book I have shown, I believe\r\nconvincingly, why sex knowledge is even more important for women than\r\nit is for men. I have examined carefully the books that have been\r\nwritten for girls and women, and I know that it is not bias, nor\r\ncarping criticism, but strict honesty that forces me to say that I\r\nhave not found one satisfactory girl's or woman's sex book. There are\r\nsome excellent books for girls and women on general hygiene; but on\r\nsex hygiene, on the general manifestations of the sex instinct, on sex\r\nethics--none. I have attempted to write such a book. Whether I have\r\nsucceeded--fully, partially or not at all--is not for me to say,\r\nthough I have my suspicions. But this I know: in writing this book I\r\nhave been strictly honest with myself, from first page to last.\r\nWhether everything I have written is the truth, I do not know. But at\r\nleast I believe that it is--or I would not have written it. And I can\r\nsolemnly say that the book is free from any cant, hypocrisy,\r\nfalsehood, exaggeration or compromise, nor has any attempt been made\r\nin any chapter to conciliate the stupid, the ignorant, the pervert, or\r\nthe sexless.\r\n\r\nAs in all my other books I have used plain, honest English. Not any\r\nplainer than necessary, but plain enough to avoid obscurity and\r\nmisconception.\r\n\r\nScience and art are both necessary to human happiness. This is not the\r\nplace to discuss the relative importance of the two. And, while I have\r\nno patience with art-for-art's-sake, I recognize that the scientist\r\ncan not be put into a narrow channel and ordered to go into a certain\r\ndefinite direction. Scientific investigations which seemed aimless and\r\nuseless have sometimes led to highly important results, and I would\r\nnot disparage science for its own sake. It has its uses. Nevertheless\r\nI personally have no use for it. To me everything must have a direct\r\nhuman purpose, a definite human application. When the cup of human\r\nlife is so overflowing with woe and pain and misery, it seems to me a\r\nnarrow dilettanteism or downright charlatanism to devote one's self to\r\npetty or bizarre problems which can have no relation to human\r\nhappiness, and to prate of self-satisfaction and self-expression. One\r\ncan have all the self-expression one wants while doing useful work.\r\n\r\nAnd working for humanity does not exclude a healthy hedonism; not the\r\nnarrow Cyrenaic, but an enlightened altruistic hedonism. And in\r\nwriting this book I have kept the human problem constantly before my\r\neyes. It was not my ambition merely to impart interesting facts: my\r\nconcern was the practical application of these facts, their relation\r\nto human happiness.\r\n\r\nIf this book should be instrumental, as I confidently trust it will,\r\nin destroying some medieval superstitions, in dissipating some\r\nhampering and cramping errors, in instilling some hope in the hearts\r\nof the hopeless, in bringing a little joy into the homes of the\r\njoyless, in increasing in however slight a degree the sum total of\r\nhuman happiness, its mission shall have been gloriously fulfilled.\r\n\r\nFor this is the mission of the book: to increase the sum total of\r\nhuman happiness.\r\n\r\n                                               W.J.R.\r\n\r\n\r\n  12 Mount Morris Park W.,\r\n    New York City.\r\n      Jan. 1, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                                           PAGE\r\n\r\nI.

All are not agreed as to the character of the\r\ninstruction, its extent, the age at which it should be begun and as to\r\nwho the teacher should be--the father, the family physician, the\r\nschool teacher or a specially prepared book--but as to the necessity\r\nof sex knowledge for the boy there is now substantial agreement--among\r\nthe conservatives as well as among the radicals.\r\n\r\nNo such agreement exists concerning sex knowledge for the girl. Many\r\nstill are the men and women--and not among the conservatives only--who\r\nare strongly opposed to girls receiving any instruction in sex\r\nmatters. Some say that such instruction--except a few hygienic rules\r\nabout menstruation--is unnecessary, because the sex instinct awakens\r\nin girls comparatively late, and it is time enough for them to learn\r\nabout such matters after they are married. Others fear that sex\r\nknowledge would destroy the mystery and romance of sex, and would rob\r\nour maidens of their greatest charms--modesty and innocence. Still\r\nothers fear that sex instruction would tend to awaken the sex instinct\r\nin our girls prematurely; would direct their thoughts to matters about\r\nwhich they would not think otherwise; and they argue that the warnings\r\nabout venereal disease, prostitution, etc., which are an integral part\r\nof sex instruction, tend to create a cynical, inimical attitude\r\ntowards the male sex, which may even result in hypochondriac ideas and\r\nantagonism to marriage.\r\n\r\nI do not deny that there is a grain of truth in all the above\r\nobjections. Sex instruction does cause _some_ girls to think of sex\r\nmatters earlier than they otherwise would, and some girls have been\r\nmade bitter and hypochondriac, and disgusted with the male sex. But it\r\nwould not be difficult to demonstrate that it was not sex instruction\r\n_per se_ that was responsible for these deplorable results; it was the\r\n_wrong_ kind of instruction that was to blame--it was the wrong\r\nemphasis, the lurid exaggerations that caused the mischief, and not\r\nthe truth. In other words, it is not sex information, it is sex\r\nmisinformation, that is pernicious. And, of course, to this everybody\r\nwill agree: rather than false information, better no information at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nBut if the information to be imparted be sane, honest and truthful,\r\nwithout exaggerating the evils and without laying undue emphasis on\r\nthe dark shadows of our sex life, then the results can be only\r\nbeneficent. And the task I have put before myself in this book is to\r\ngive our girls and women sane, square and honest information about\r\ntheir sex organs and sex nature, information absolutely free from\r\nluridness, on the one hand, and maudlin sentimentality, on the other.\r\nThe female sex is in need of such information, much more so than is\r\nthe male sex. Yes, if boys, as is now universally agreed, are in need\r\nof sex instruction, then girls are much more in need of it. Why? For\r\nseveral important reasons.\r\n\r\nThe first reason why sex instruction is even more important for girls\r\nthan it is for boys is because a misstep in a girl has much more\r\ndisastrous consequences than it has in a boy. The disastrous results\r\nof a misstep in a boy are only physical in character; the results of\r\nthe _same_ misstep in a girl may be physical, moral, social and\r\neconomic. To speak more plainly. If a boy, through ignorance, rashly\r\nindulges in illicit sexual relations, the worst consequence to him may\r\nbe infection with a venereal disease. But he is not considered\r\nimmoral, he is not despised, he is not ostracized, he does not lose\r\nhis social standing in the slightest degree, and when he is cured of\r\nhis venereal disease he has no difficulty in getting married. He does\r\nnot even have to conceal his past sexual history from his wife. But if\r\na girl makes a misstep the consequences to her are terrible indeed; it\r\nmay not only cost her her health and social standing, she may have to\r\npay with her very life. She runs the risk of venereal infection the\r\nsame as the boy does, but in addition she runs the risk of becoming\r\npregnant, which in our present social system is a catastrophe indeed.\r\nTo save herself from the disgrace of an illegitimate child she may\r\nhave an abortion produced; the abortion may have no bad results, but\r\nit may, if performed bunglingly, leave her an invalid for life, or it\r\nmay kill her outright. If she is so unfortunate as to be unable to get\r\nanybody to produce an abortion, she gives birth to an illegitimate\r\nchild, which she is forced in most cases to put away in an institution\r\nof some sort where she hopes and prays it may die soon--and, in\r\ngeneral, it does. If it does not die, she has for the rest of her life\r\na Damocles' sword hanging over her head, and she is in constant terror\r\nlest her sin be found out. She does not permit herself to look for a\r\nmate, but if she does get married, the specter of her antematrimonial\r\nexperience is constantly before her eyes. After years and years of\r\nmarried life, the husband may divorce her if he finds out that she had\r\n\"sinned\" before she knew him. And unless the husband is a broad-minded\r\nman and loves her truly and unless she made a clean breast of\r\neverything to him before marriage, her life is continuous torture. But\r\neven if the girl escaped pregnancy, the mere finding out that she had\r\nan illicit experience deprives her of social standing, or makes her a\r\nsocial outcast and entirely destroys or greatly minimizes her chances\r\nof ever marrying and establishing a home of her own. She must remain a\r\nlonely wanderer to the end of her days.\r\n\r\nThe enormous difference in the results of a misstep in a boy and a\r\ngirl is clearly seen, and for this reason alone, if for no other, sex\r\ninstruction is of more importance to the girl than it is to the boy.\r\n\r\nBut there are other important reasons, and one of them is beautifully\r\nand truthfully expressed by Byron in his two well-known lines.\r\n\r\n    Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,\r\n    'Tis woman's whole existence.\r\n\r\nYes, love is a woman's whole life.\r\n\r\nSome modern women might object to this. They might say that this was\r\ntrue of the woman of the past, who was excluded from all other avenues\r\nof human activity. The woman of the present day has other interests\r\nbesides those of Love. But I claim that this is true of only a small\r\npercentage of women; and in even this small minority of women, social,\r\nscientific and artistic activities cannot take the place of love; no\r\nmatter how busy and successful these women may be, they will tell you\r\nif you enjoy their confidence that they are unhappy, if their love\r\nlife is unsatisfactory. Nothing, nothing can fill the void made by the\r\nlack of love. The various activities may help to cover up the void, to\r\nprotect it from strange eyes, they cannot fill it. For essentially\r\nwoman is made for love. Not exclusively, but essentially, and a woman\r\nwho has had no love in her life has been a failure. The few exceptions\r\nthat may be mentioned only emphasize the rule.\r\n\r\nBut not only psychically is a woman's love and sex life more important\r\nthan a man's, physically she is also much more cognizant of her sex\r\nand much more hampered by the manifestation of her sex nature than\r\nman is. To take but one function, menstruation. From the age 13 or 14\r\nto the age of forty-five or fifty it is a monthly reminder to woman\r\nthat she is a woman, that she is a creature of sex; and, while to many\r\nwomen this periodically recurring function is only a source of some\r\nannoyance or discomfort, to a great number it is a cause of pain,\r\nheadache, suffering, or complete disability. Man has no such\r\nphenomenon to annoy him practically his whole life.\r\n\r\nBut more important are the results of love-union, of sex relations. A\r\nman after a sexual relation is just as free as he was before. A woman,\r\nif the relation has resulted in a pregnancy, which is generally the\r\ncase, unless special pains are taken it should not so result, has nine\r\ntroublesome months before her, months of discomfort if not of actual\r\nsuffering; she then has an extremely trying and painful ordeal, that\r\nof childbirth, and then there is another trying period, the period of\r\nlactation or of nursing and of bringing up the baby. The penalty seems\r\nalmost too great.\r\n\r\nAnd when the woman is on the point of ceasing to menstruate she does\r\nnot do so smoothly and comfortably. She has to go through a period\r\ncalled the menopause, which may last one or two years and which may\r\nbring discomforts and dangers of its own. Man does not have to go\r\nthrough such a distinct period of demarcation separating his sexual\r\nfrom his non-sexual life. Altogether it cannot be denied that woman is\r\nmuch more a slave of her sex nature than man is of his. Yes, Nature\r\nhas handicapped woman much more heavily than she has man.\r\n\r\nIn short, both in view of the fact that sexual ignorance with its\r\npossible missteps has much more disastrous consequences for the girl\r\nthan it has for the boy, and in view of the fact that the sex instinct\r\nand its physical and psychic manifestations occupy a much more\r\nimportant part in woman's life than they do in the life of man, we\r\nconsider the necessity of sex instruction much greater in the case of\r\nwoman than in the case of man. I do not wish to be misunderstood as\r\nunderestimating the need of sex instruction for the male--only I\r\nconsider the need even greater in the case of the female.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\nTHE FEMALE SEX ORGANS: THEIR ANATOMY\r\n\r\n The Internal Sex Organs--The Ovaries--The Fallopian Tubes--The\r\n  Uterus--The Divisions of the Uterus--Anteversion, Anteflexion,\r\n  Retroversion, Retroflexion, of the Uterus--Endometritis--The\r\n  Vagina--The Hymen--Imperforate Hymen--The External Genitals--The\r\n  Vulva, Labia Majora, Labia Minora, the Mons Veneris, the\r\n  Clitoris, the Urethra--The Breasts--The Pelvis--The Difference\r\n  Between the Male and Female Pelvis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe organs which primarily distinguish one sex from the other are the\r\nsex organs. It is by the aid of the sex organs that children are\r\nbegotten and brought into the world, that the race is _reproduced_ and\r\nperpetuated. It is for this reason that the sex organs are also called\r\nthe Reproductive Organs.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we must do is to become familiar with the _structure_\r\nand _location_ of the sex organs; in other words, we must get a fair\r\nidea of their _Anatomy_.\r\n\r\nThe female sex organs, also called the reproductive or generative\r\norgans, are divided into internal and external. The internal are the\r\nmost important and consist of: the ovaries, Fallopian tubes, uterus\r\nor womb, and vagina. The external sex organs of the female are: the\r\nvulva, hymen, and clitoris. Among the external organs are also\r\ngenerally included the mons Veneris and the breasts or mammary glands.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCHAPTER A\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNAL SEX ORGANS\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: OVARY.]\r\n\r\n=The Ovaries.= The ovaries are the essential organs of reproduction.\r\nFor it is they that generate the eggs, or _ova_, or _ovules_, which,\r\nafter becoming _fertilized_ or _fecundated_ by the spermatozoa of the\r\nmale, develop into children. Without the ovaries of the female, the\r\nsame as without the testicles of the male (to which they correspond),\r\nno children could be begotten, and the entire human race would quickly\r\ndisappear from our planet. The ovaries are two in number; they are\r\nembedded in the _broad ligaments_ which support the womb in the\r\npelvis, one on each side of the womb. They are of a grayish or whitish\r\npink color, and are about an inch and a half long, three-quarters of\r\nan inch wide, and one-third of an inch thick. They weigh from\r\none-eighth to one-quarter of an ounce. Their surface is either smooth\r\nor rough and puckered. Think of a large blanched almond and you will\r\nhave a pretty fair idea of the size and shape of an ovary.\r\n\r\n=The Fallopian Tubes.= The Fallopian tubes (so called from Fallopius,\r\na great anatomist, who discovered them; also called oviducts: egg\r\nconductors, because they conduct the eggs from the ovary into the\r\nuterus) are two very thin tubes, extending one from each upper angle\r\nof the womb to the ovaries; but at their ovarian end they expand into\r\na fringed and trumpet-shaped extremity. The fringes are referred to as\r\n_fimbria_. They are about five inches long and only about\r\none-sixteenth of an inch in diameter; the function of the tubes is to\r\ncatch the ova as they burst forth from the ovaries and to convey them\r\nto the uterus. Taking into consideration the very narrow _lumen_, or\r\n_caliber_, of the Fallopian tubes, it is easy to understand why even a\r\nvery slight inflammation is apt to clog them up, to seal their mouths\r\nor openings, thus rendering the woman _sterile_, or incapable of\r\nhaving children. For, if the Fallopian tubes are \"clogged\" up, the\r\neggs, or ova, have no way of reaching the uterus.\r\n\r\nThe Greek name for the Fallopian tube is salpinx (salpinx in Greek\r\nmeans tube). An inflammation of the Fallopian tube is therefore called\r\nsalpingitis. (A salpingitis has the same effect in causing sterility\r\nin the female as has an epididymitis in the male.) Salpingectomy is\r\nthe cutting away of the whole or of a piece of the Fallopian tube\r\n(corresponds to vasectomy in the male).\r\n\r\n=The Uterus.= The uterus or womb is the organ in which the fertilized\r\novum, or egg, grows and develops into a child. It is a hollow muscular\r\norgan, about the size of a pear, with thick walls, capable under the\r\ninfluence of pregnancy of great expansion and growth. The broad part\r\nof the pear is called the _body_ of the uterus; the lower narrow part\r\nis called the _neck_ of the uterus, or _cervix_. The uterus in the\r\nadult girl or woman is about three inches long, two inches broad in\r\nits upper part and nearly an inch thick. It weighs from an ounce to an\r\nounce and a half. When the uterus is in a pregnant condition, it\r\nincreases enormously, both in size and in weight, as we will see in a\r\nfuture chapter. The cavity of the uterus is somewhat triangular in\r\nshape; at each upper angle is the small opening communicating with the\r\nFallopian tube; the upper portion of the uterus is called the fundus;\r\nthe external opening of the womb, situated in the center of the\r\ncervix, is called the mouth of the womb, or the _os_, or external os.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: 1. OPENINGS INTO THE FALLOPIAN TUBES. 2. MOUTH OF\r\n   THE WOMB.]\r\n\r\nThe uterus is situated in the center of the pelvis, between the\r\nbladder and the rectum. It is supported by certain ligaments, the\r\nchief of which are the broad ligaments; but, on account of general\r\nweakness, too hard physical labor, or lifting heavy weights, the\r\nligaments may stretch, and the uterus may sink down low in the vagina,\r\nand we then have the condition known as prolapse of the womb. Or, the\r\nwomb may turn forward, when we have a condition of _anteversion_. If\r\nthe womb is _bent_ (or _flexed_) forward on itself the condition is\r\ncalled _anteflexion_. If the womb is turned backwards, the condition\r\nis called _retroversion_; if it is bent or flexed backward upon itself\r\nthe condition is called _retroflexion_. An extreme degree of\r\nanteversion or anteflexion, or retroversion or retroflexion, may\r\ninterfere with impregnation, as the spermatozoa may find it\r\ndifficult or impossible to reach the opening of the womb--the external\r\nos.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (Female Reproductive Organs)]\r\n\r\nThe entire cavity of the uterus is lined by a mucous membrane;[1] this\r\nmucous membrane is called the endometrium (endo--within;\r\nmetra--uterus). An inflammation of the endometrium is called\r\n_endometritis_. It is the endometrium that is principally concerned in\r\nmenstruation--that is, it is from it that the monthly discharge of\r\nblood comes.\r\n\r\n=The Vagina= [vagina in Latin--a sheath]. The vagina is the tube or\r\ncanal which serves as a passage-way between the uterus and the outside\r\nof the body. It extends from the external genitals or vulva to the\r\nneck of the womb, embracing the latter for some distance. It is a\r\nstrong, fibromuscular canal, lined with mucous membrane. It is not\r\nsmooth inside, but arranged in folds, or _rugae_, so that when\r\nnecessary, as during childbirth, it can stretch enormously and permit\r\nthe passage of a child's head. The length of the vaginal canal is\r\nbetween three and five inches, but it is in general much more\r\ncapacious in women that have borne one or more children than in those\r\nwho have not borne any.\r\n\r\nNear the vaginal entrance are situated two small glands; they are\r\nabout the size of a pea, and secrete mucus. They are called\r\nBartholin's glands; occasionally they become inflamed and give a good\r\ndeal of trouble.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ANTEVERSION OF THE UTERUS.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ANTEFLEXION OF THE UTERUS.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: RETROVERSION OF THE UTERUS.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: RETROFLEXION OF THE UTERUS.]\r\n\r\n=The Hymen= [hymen in Greek--a membrane]. The external opening of the\r\nvagina, in virgins, that is, in girls or women who have not had sexual\r\nintercourse, is almost entirely closed by a membrane called the hymen.\r\nThe vulgar name for hymen is \"maidenhead.\" The hymen may be of various\r\nshapes, and of different consistency. In some girls it is a very thin\r\nmembrane, which tears very readily; in others it is quite tough. On\r\nthe upper margin or in the center of the hymen there is an opening\r\nwhich permits any secretion from the vagina and the blood from the\r\nuterus to come through. In rare cases there is no opening in the\r\nhymen, that is, the vagina is entirely closed. Such a hymen is called\r\n_imperforate_ (not perforated). When the girl begins to menstruate,\r\nthe blood cannot come out and it accumulates in the vagina. In such\r\ncases the hymen must be opened or slit by a doctor. In some cases the\r\nhymen is congenitally absent; that is, the girl is born without any\r\nhymen. While the hymen is usually ruptured during the first\r\nintercourse, it, in some cases, being elastic and stretchable,\r\npersists untorn after sexual intercourse. It will therefore be seen\r\nthat just as the presence of the hymen is no absolute proof of\r\nvirginity, so is the absence of the hymen no absolute proof that the\r\ngirl has had sexual relations, She might have been born without any\r\nhymen, or it might have been ruptured by vaginal examination, by a\r\nvaginal douche, by scratching to relieve itching, or by some accident.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the hymen after it is ruptured shrink and form little\r\nelevations which can be easily felt; they are known as caruncles.\r\n[In Latin, _carunculae myrtiformes_, which means in English\r\nmyrtleberry-shaped caruncles; caruncle is a small fleshy elevation;\r\nderived from _caro_, which in Latin means flesh.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCHAPTER B\r\n\r\nTHE EXTERNAL GENITALS\r\n\r\n=The Vulva.= The external genitals of the female are called the\r\n_vulva_. The vulva consists of the labia majora (meaning the larger\r\nlips), which are on the outside and which in the grown-up girl are\r\ncovered with hair, and the labia minora (the smaller lips), which are\r\non the inside and which are usually only seen when the labia majora\r\nare taken apart.\r\n\r\n[Vulva in Latin means folding-door. The ancients Were fond of giving\r\nfancy names to things.]\r\n\r\n=The Mons Veneris.= The elevation above the vulva, which during\r\npuberty becomes covered with hair, is called by the fanciful name,\r\n_mons Veneris_, or Venus' mountain. It is usually well padded with\r\nfatty tissue.\r\n\r\n=The Clitoris.= The clitoris is a small body about an inch in length,\r\nsituated beneath the mons Veneris and partly or entirely covered by\r\nthe upper borders of the labia minora.\r\n\r\n=The Urethra.= Between the clitoris above and the opening of the\r\nvagina below is situated the opening of the _urethra_, or the urinary\r\nmeatus, through which the urine passes. Many women are so ignorant,\r\nor, let us say innocent, that they think the urine passes out through\r\nthe vagina. This is not so. The vagina has nothing to do with the\r\nprocess of urination.\r\n\r\nAgain enumerating the female sex organs, but in the reverse order,\r\nfrom before backward, or from out inward, we have: The mons Veneris\r\nand the labia majora, or the external lips of the vulva; these are the\r\nplainly visible parts of the female genital organs. When the labia\r\nmajora are taken apart we see the labia minora; when the labia majora\r\nand minora are taken apart we can see or feel the clitoris and the\r\nhymen, or the remains of the hymen. We then have the vagina, a large,\r\nstretchable musculo-membranous canal, in the upper portion of which\r\nthe neck of the womb, or the cervix, can be seen (when a speculum is\r\nused), or felt by the finger. Only the cervix, or neck of the womb,\r\ncan be seen, but the rest of the womb, the broader portion, can be\r\neasily felt and examined by one hand in the vagina and the other hand\r\nover the abdomen. Continuous with the uterus are the Fallopian tubes,\r\nand below the trumpet-shaped ends of the Fallopian tubes are the\r\novaries, embedded in the broad ligaments, one on each side.\r\n\r\n=The Breasts.= The breasts, also called mammary glands, or mammae\r\n[mamma in Latin, breast], may be considered as accessory organs of\r\nreproduction. They are of no importance in the male, in whom they are\r\nusually rudimentary, but they are of great importance in the female.\r\nThey manufacture milk, which is necessary for the proper nutrition of\r\nthe infant, and they add a great deal to the beauty and attractiveness\r\nof the woman. They are thus a help to the woman in getting a mate or a\r\nhusband. The projecting elevation of the breast, which the child takes\r\nin his mouth when nursing, is called the nipple; the darker colored\r\narea surrounding the nipple is called the areola.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE PELVIS OF THE MALE.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE PELVIS OF THE FEMALE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCHAPTER C\r\n\r\nTHE PELVIS\r\n\r\nThe internal sex organs are situated in the lower part of the\r\nabdominal cavity, the part that is called the _pelvis_, or pelvic\r\ncavity. The meaning of the word pelvis in Latin is basin. The pelvis,\r\nalso referred to as the pelvic girdle or pelvic arch, forms a bony\r\nbasin, and is composed of three powerful bones: the sacrum, consisting\r\nof five vertebrae fused together and constituting the solid part of the\r\nspine, or vertebral column, in the back, and the two hipbones, one on\r\neach side. The two hipbones meet in front, forming the _pubic arch_.\r\n\r\nThe hipbones are called in Latin the ossa innominata (nameless bones)\r\nand each hipbone is composed of three bones: the ilium, the ischium,\r\nand the os pubis. The thighs are attached to the hipbones, and to the\r\nhipbones are also attached the large _gluteal_ muscles, which form the\r\nbuttocks, or the \"seat.\"\r\n\r\nThe pelvis of the female differs considerably from the pelvis of the\r\nmale. The female pelvis is shallower and wider, less massive, the\r\nmargins of the bones are more widely separated, thus giving greater\r\nprominence to the hips; the sacrum is shorter and less curved, and the\r\npubic arch is wider and more rounded. All this is necessary in order\r\nto permit the child's head to pass through. If the female pelvis were\r\nexactly like the male pelvis, a full-term living child could never\r\npass through it. The two illustrations show the differences between\r\nthe male and female pelvis very clearly.\r\n\r\nNote particularly the differences in the pubic arches: in the male\r\npelvis it is really more of an angle than an arch. Also note how much\r\nlonger and more solid the sacrum (with its attached bone, called the\r\ncoccyx[2]) is in the male pelvis. The differences in the pelves (the\r\nplural of pelvis is pelves) of the male and female become fully marked\r\nat puberty, but they are present as early as the fourth month of\r\nintra-uterine life.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Mucous membrane--briefly a membrane which secretes mucus or some\r\nother fluid.\r\n\r\n[2] The coccyx consists of three rudimentary vertebrae; it is the\r\nvestige of an organ which we once possessed in common with many other\r\nanimals, namely--a tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE FEMALE SEX ORGANS\r\n\r\n Function of the Ovaries--Internal Secretion of the\r\n  Ovaries--Function of the Internal Secretion--Number of Ova in the\r\n  Ovaries--The Graafian Follicles--Ovulation--Corpora\r\n  Lutea--Function of the Fallopian Tubes--Function of the\r\n  Vagina--Functions of the Vulva, Clitoris and Mons\r\n  Veneris--Function of the Breasts--Besides Secreting Milk Breast\r\n  Has Sexual Function--The Orgasm--Pollutions in Women--Secondary\r\n  Sex Characters--Differences Between Woman and Man.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of an organ depends upon its _function_, upon what it\r\ndoes, and not so much upon what it is. It is important to know the\r\nsize, structure and location of an organ, but it is still more\r\nimportant to know its function; in other words, for our purpose it is\r\nmore important to know the _physiology_ than the anatomy of the sex\r\norgans.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCHAPTER A\r\n\r\nFUNCTION OF THE OVARIES\r\n\r\nLike the testicles in man, so the ovaries in woman are the essential\r\nsexual organs. They are the fundamental organs, without which the\r\nother sexual organs are useless. Also like the testicles in man, the\r\novaries have two distinct functions, manufacturing two distinct\r\nsubstances. One function is to manufacture eggs; this, called the\r\nooegenetic or egg-producing function, is its _racial_ function; without\r\nit the race could not perpetuate itself. But the ovary has also an\r\n_individual_ function. Besides the ova, the ovary manufactures what we\r\ncall an _internal_ secretion which is absorbed by the blood, and which\r\nis of the greatest importance to the woman herself. While the\r\nmanufacture of ova begins only at puberty, with menstruation, and\r\ncloses at the menopause, the manufacture of the internal secretion\r\nlasts throughout the woman's entire life. This secretion, which\r\nconsists of various chemical substances, has a tremendous influence\r\nnot only on the development of the woman's body, but also on her\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nFirst of all it is necessary for the development of the woman's\r\nspecial characteristics, or _secondary sexual characters_. Without\r\nthat internal secretion of the ovaries, a woman would look more or\r\nless like a man; she would not develop her beautiful rounded form, her\r\npretty long hair, her breasts, her broad pelvis, her feminine voice,\r\netc. _Second_, the secretion is necessary to the proper development of\r\nher other sexual organs; if the ovaries are cut out, then the uterus\r\nand the vagina and even the vulva shrivel up. _Third_, it is that\r\ninternal secretion that excites in woman sexual desire and makes her\r\nenjoy relations with the male sex. If the ovaries are cut away,\r\nparticularly if it is done early in life, the woman has no sexual\r\ndesire and no enjoyment. _Fourth_, it contributes to the general\r\nhealth, wellbeing, energy, and mental alertness of the woman.\r\n\r\nYou see the importance of the internal ovarian secretion, and you will\r\nreadily understand why, when the ovaries are removed by operation, the\r\nwoman, particularly if she is young, undergoes such marked changes. It\r\nis because we recognize now the great importance of the ovaries that\r\nwe always, when operating on diseased ovaries leave at least a small\r\npiece of ovary, if at all possible.\r\n\r\n=Number of Ova.= When the female infant is born, her ovaries contain\r\nas many ova or eggs as they ever will contain. In fact, they contain\r\nmore than they will at puberty. For it is estimated that at birth each\r\novary contains about 100,000 ova; the majority of these, however,\r\ndisappear so that at the age of puberty each ovary contains only about\r\n30,000 ova. As only one ovum ripens each month from the time of\r\npuberty to the time of the menopause (i.e., about 300 to 400 ova at\r\nthe utmost during a lifetime), and as only a dozen or two ova would\r\nbe necessary for the propagation of the race, it seems a\r\nsuperabundance of ova, an unnecessary lavishness. But nature _is_\r\nlavish where the propagation of the species is concerned. A portion of\r\nan ovary or of both ovaries might become diseased, and thousands of\r\nova might become unfit for fertilization; nature therefore puts in an\r\nextra reserve supply. We see a still more striking example of this\r\nextreme extravagant lavishness in man; only one spermatozooen is\r\nnecessary to impregnate the ovum, and only one spermatozooen can\r\npenetrate the ovum; nevertheless each normal ejaculation of semen\r\ncontains between a quarter and half a million spermatozoa.\r\n\r\n=The Graafian Follicles.= Each primitive or primordial ovum[3] is\r\nimbedded in a little vesicle or follicle, which is generally known as\r\n_Graafian follicle_, and there are as many Graafian follicles as there\r\nare ova. (The Graafian follicles were first described about 250 years\r\nago--in 1672--by a Delft physician named De Graaf, hence the name.)\r\nUntil puberty, that is the commencement of menstruation, the Graafian\r\nfollicles with the ooecytes or primitive ova are in a more or less\r\ndormant condition. But with the onset of puberty there commences a\r\nperiod of intense activity in the ovaries. This period of activity is\r\nrepeated regularly once a month, and it constitutes the process of\r\n_ovulation_ and _menstruation_. The two processes are closely though\r\nnot causally connected. Ovulation consists in the monthly maturation\r\nand extrusion of a ripe ovum; menstruation, which will be further\r\ndiscussed in a separate chapter, consists in the monthly discharge of\r\nblood, mixed with mucus from the inside lining of the uterus. Every\r\ntwenty-eight days, from the time of puberty to the time of the\r\nmenopause, a Graafian follicle bursts and an ovum is extruded from the\r\novary. Before the follicle bursts, it swells and enlarges and reaches\r\nthe surface of the ovary; the whole follicle is congested with blood,\r\nbut at one point near the surface of the ovary it is pale and thin,\r\nand here the rupture takes place.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SECTION OF OVARY.\r\n    1. Graafian follicle in the earliest stage. 2, 3, 4. Follicles in\r\n    more advanced stages. 5, 7. Almost mature follicle. 6. Follicle\r\n    from which the ovum has escaped. 8. Corpus luteum.]\r\n\r\n=Corpora Lutea.= After the Graafian follicle has burst and the ovum\r\nhas been pushed out, the cavity that is left does not remain empty and\r\nfunctionless; there is a further process going on there; there is a\r\ngrowth of cells, of a yellowish color, and the follicle becomes filled\r\nwith a yellowish body, which on account of its color is called the\r\n_corpus luteum_ (plural--corpora lutea; luteum in Latin--yellow,\r\ncorpus--body). This corpus luteum grows in size until it sometimes\r\noccupies as much as one-third of the ovary. But there is considerable\r\ndifference between the corpora lutea of non-pregnant and pregnant\r\nwomen. Up to the end of about a month the corpora lutea are the same,\r\nbut after that the corpus luteum of the non-pregnant woman begins to\r\nget smaller, to shrink, so that at the end of two or three months it\r\nis reduced to a small scar and later cannot be noticed at all. The\r\ncorpus luteum of the pregnant woman keeps on increasing until the end\r\nof the second month, remains about the same size until the end of the\r\nsixth month, and only then begins gradually to diminish. The corpus\r\nluteum of the non-pregnant woman, that is, the one following\r\nmenstruation, is called false corpus luteum; the corpus luteum\r\nfollowing pregnancy is called a true corpus luteum. The corpus luteum\r\nacts like a gland and elaborates a secretion which has an influence on\r\nthe circulation in the uterus and on menstruation. It probably\r\npossesses other properties, with which we are not yet quite familiar.\r\nThe corpora lutea of various animals are now prepared in powder or\r\ntablet form and used in medicine in the treatment of certain diseases\r\nof women.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCHAPTER B\r\n\r\nFUNCTION OF THE OTHER GENITAL ORGANS\r\n\r\n=Function of the Fallopian Tubes.= The function of the Fallopian tubes\r\nor oviducts as they are sometimes called is to catch the ovum as it\r\nbursts through the ovary and to conduct it from the ovary into the\r\nuterus. It is while the ovum is in the narrow lumen of the tube that\r\nthe spermatozooen which has travelled up from the uterus usually finds\r\nit, and it is in the tube, near its entrance to the womb, that\r\nimpregnation usually takes place. After the ovum is impregnated or\r\nfecundated, it slowly moves down to the uterus, where it attaches\r\nitself and remains and grows for nine months, until it is ready to\r\ncome out and start an independent life.\r\n\r\nThe uterus or womb is the house of the embryo almost from the moment\r\nof conception to the moment of birth. Within the thick warm sheltered\r\nwalls of the uterus the child grows, develops, eats and breathes,\r\nuntil all its organs and functions have reached such a stage of\r\nperfection that it can live by itself and for itself. And this may be\r\nsaid to be the sole function of the uterus, or at least its sole\r\nuseful function. For the other function of the uterus, menstruation,\r\ncannot be said to be a necessary or a useful function. It is a normal\r\nfunction because it occurs regularly in every healthy woman during her\r\nchild-bearing period, but not every normal function is a necessary or\r\nuseful function. Not everything that is is right or useful.\r\n\r\n=Function of the Vagina.= The vagina is the canal in which sexual\r\nintercourse takes place. It receives the male organ (penis) during the\r\nsexual act, and serves as a temporary repository for the male semen.\r\nAfter the spermatozoa have reached the uterus, the vagina has no\r\nfurther function to perform.\r\n\r\n=Functions of the Vulva, Clitoris=, and =Mons Veneris.= The vulva and\r\nthe clitoris have no special functions to perform; but in them, in the\r\nclitoris particularly, but also in the labia minora, resides the\r\nfeeling of voluptuousness, the pleasurable sensation experienced\r\nduring the sexual act. Another seat of voluptuousness in the woman is\r\nlocated in the cervix of the uterus.\r\n\r\nThe mons Veneris has no special physiological function to perform, but\r\nit as well as the vulva serve as strong points of attraction for the\r\nmale sex. While the entire female body is attractive to the male, and\r\nvice versa, there are certain zones which are especially attractive or\r\nexciting. Such zones or areas are called _erogenous zones_--the word\r\nerogenous means love-generating. The vulva and the mons Veneris are\r\nthe strongest erogenous zones; other erogenous zones are the lips, the\r\nbreasts, etc.\r\n\r\n=Function of the Breasts.= The function of the breasts is to nurse or\r\nsuckle the young on the mother's milk until they are able to live on\r\nother food. The other name for breasts is mammary gland (in Latin,\r\nmamma--breast), and all animals who suckle their young are called\r\nmammals or mammalia. Besides its milk secreting function, the breasts\r\nconstitute a strong erogenous zone; they are a point of strong\r\nattraction for the male sex, many men being more attracted by\r\nwell-developed breasts than by a pretty face. There is a good\r\nbiological reason for this. Well developed breasts indicate that the\r\nother sexual organs are well developed and that the woman will make a\r\nsatisfactory wife and satisfactory mother. Considering then the\r\nimportance of the breasts in attracting a husband and their function\r\nin nursing the young, also their erogenous properties, it is perfectly\r\nproper to class them among the reproductive organs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCHAPTER C\r\n\r\nTHE ORGASM\r\n\r\nThe culmination of the act of sexual intercourse is called the orgasm.\r\nIt is the moment at which the pleasurable sensation is at its highest\r\npoint, the body experiences a thrill, there is a spasmodic contraction\r\nin the genital organs, and there is a secretion of fluid from the\r\ngenital glands and mucous membranes. This fluid in women is not a\r\nvital fluid like the semen in man; it is merely mucus, and in some\r\nwomen it is very slight in amount or altogether absent. Adult women\r\nwho live without sexual relations occasionally have sexual or erotic\r\ndreams; that is, they dream that they are in the company of men,\r\nplaying or having relations with them. Such dreams are usually\r\naccompanied by an orgasm or an orgastic feeling, and by a discharge of\r\nmucus, the same as in sexual intercourse. Such a discharge of mucus\r\nduring sleep is called an emission or pollution.\r\n\r\nIn the male sex pollutions play an important role (see the author's\r\n\"Sex Knowledge for men\"), because the semen is a vital fluid, and if\r\nit is lost too frequently the system is put under a heavy drain. In\r\nboys and men the pollutions or night losses may occur several times a\r\nweek or even every night, or several times a night. When they occur\r\nwith such frequency the man may become a wreck. Not so with women.\r\nFirst, pollutions or night dreams in women are much more rare than\r\nthey are in men; and second, as just mentioned, the fluid secreted by\r\nwoman during intercourse or during an erotic dream is not of a vital\r\ncharacter, as the semen is in man; it is mucus, and the secretion of a\r\nmucous fluid, even if somewhat excessive, does not constitute a drain\r\non the system. For this reason women can stand frequently repeated sex\r\nrelations and emissions or pollutions much better than men can.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCHAPTER D\r\n\r\nTHE SECONDARY SEX CHARACTERS\r\n\r\nThe sex organs constitute the primary sex characters. It is they that\r\ndistinguish primarily one sex from another. But there are numerous\r\nother sex characters or sex differences which while not so important\r\nserve to differentiate the sexes, at the same time forming points of\r\nattraction between one sex and another. For instance, the beard and\r\nmustache are a distinct male characteristic and constitute one of the\r\nsecondary male sex characters. The secondary sex characters are very\r\nnumerous; one might say that each one of the billions of cells in the\r\nbody bears the impress of the sex to which it belongs.\r\n\r\nFirst, the skeleton. The entire female skeleton differs from the male\r\nskeleton; all the bones are smaller and more gracile; the pelvis, as\r\nwe have seen before, is shallower and wider. Then the muscles are\r\nsmaller and more rounded. The entire contour of the body is rounded\r\nrather than angular as in man. The skin is finer, softer, more\r\ndelicate. The hair on the head is longer and of a finer texture, while\r\nover the body the hair is also finer and less abundant. The voice is\r\nfiner, more pleasant, and of a higher pitch (soprano). The breasts are\r\nwell developed, and serve an important purpose, while in men they are\r\nrudimentary. The breathing is also different; woman breathes\r\nprincipally with the upper part of the chest, man with the lower. The\r\nbrain is smaller and its convolutions somewhat less complex in woman.\r\n\r\nWoman differs considerably from man not only physically, as we have\r\nseen, but also mentally and emotionally. But into this phase of the\r\nsubject we will not enter, except to remark that it is foolish to\r\nspeak of the superiority or inferiority of one sex to another. In some\r\nrespects man is greatly superior to woman, in others he is inferior;\r\non the whole the sexes balance one another pretty well, and while the\r\nsexes are not and never will be exactly alike, we have no right to\r\nspeak of the inferiority of one sex to another. We recognize that the\r\nsexes are different, but they complement one another, and the claim of\r\nthe reactionary and of the woman-hater that woman is an inferior\r\ncreature is just as senseless as is the claim made by some\r\nultra-militant feminists that woman is the superior and man the\r\ninferior.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] The ovum is really the fully mature egg ready for fecundation;\r\nbefore maturity it should not be called ovum but ooecyte; and in\r\nadvanced treatises it is so referred to. But here ovum will do for\r\nboth the unripe and ripe egg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\nTHE SEX INSTINCT\r\n\r\n Universality of the Sex Instinct--Not Responsible for Our Thoughts\r\n  and Feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE sex instinct, which runs all through nature from the lowest animal\r\nto the highest, is the inborn impulse, craving or desire which one sex\r\nhas for the other: the male for the female and the female for the\r\nmale. This instinct, this desire for the opposite sex, which is born\r\nwith us and which manifests itself at a very early age, is not\r\nanything to be ashamed of. There is nothing disgraceful, nothing\r\nsinful in it. It is a normal, natural, healthy instinct, implanted in\r\nus by nature for various reasons, and absolutely indispensable for the\r\nperpetuation of the race. If there were anything to be ashamed of, it\r\nwould be the lack of this sex instinct, for without it the race would\r\nquickly die out.\r\n\r\n=Not Responsible for Thoughts and Feelings.= It is necessary to\r\nimpress this point, because many girls and women, whose minds have\r\nbeen perverted by a vicious so-called morality, worry themselves to\r\nillness, brood and become hypochondriac because they think they have\r\ncommitted a grievous sin in experiencing a desire for sexual relations\r\nor for the embrace of a certain man. Altogether it is necessary to\r\nimpress upon the growing girl, when the occasion presents itself, that\r\na thought or a feeling can never be sinful. An action may be, but a\r\nthought or a feeling cannot. Why? Because we are not responsible for\r\nour thoughts and feelings; they are not under our control. Though it\r\ndoes not mean that when they do arise we are to give them full sway.\r\nWe should attempt to combat them and drive them away, but there is\r\nnothing to be ashamed of, because for their origin we are not\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\n=Responsible for Actions.= Our actions are under our control, to a\r\ncertain extent at least, and if we do a bad or injurious act, we have\r\ncommitted a sin and are morally responsible. The _desire_ for the\r\nsexual act is no more sinful than the desire for food is when one is\r\nhungry. But the performance of the act may, under certain\r\ncircumstances, be as sinful as the eating of food which the hungry man\r\nobtained by robbing another fellow-being, just as poor as himself.\r\n\r\nI am not preaching to you. But I am not an extremist nor a hypocrite.\r\nI am advocating neither asceticism nor licentiousness. One is as bad,\r\nor almost as bad, as the other.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to do is to inculcate in your minds, if possible, a\r\nsane, well-balanced view of all things sexual.\r\n\r\nFor I believe that wrong, perverted views of the physiology and\r\nhygiene of the sex act and of sex morality, that is, the proper\r\nrelationship of the sexes, are responsible for untold misery, for\r\nincalculable suffering. Both sexes suffer, but the female sex suffers\r\nmore. The woman always pays more. This is due to her natural\r\ndisabilities (menstruation, pregnancy, lactation), to her age-long\r\nrepression, to the fact that she must be sought but never seek, and to\r\nher economic dependence.\r\n\r\nFor the above reasons, sex instruction is a matter of double\r\nimportance to woman--this fact has been emphasized in the first\r\nchapter. But woman's disabilities impose upon us another duty:\r\n_because_ she carries the heaviest burden, _because_ she always pays\r\nmore dearly than the man, it becomes incumbent upon man to treat her\r\nwith special consideration, with genuine kindness and chivalry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\nPUBERTY\r\n\r\n Physical Changes in Puberty--Physical Changes in the Genital\r\n  Organs and in the Rest of the Body--Psychic Changes--Puberty and\r\n  Adolescence--Nubility.\r\n\r\n\r\nPuberty is the most wonderful, the most significant period in a girl's\r\nlife. Important as it is in a boy's life and development, it is still\r\nmore so in a girl's. At this period there are often laid the\r\nfoundations which either make or mar the girl's future life.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the word puberty is maturity. It is the period at which\r\nthe girl and the boy reach sexual maturity; in other words, the period\r\nat which the sex glands of the boy begin to generate spermatozoa, and\r\nthe sex glands of the girl begin to mature and expel eggs or ova; with\r\nthe girl puberty is marked by an additional phenomenon, which has no\r\nanalogue in the boy, namely, menstruation.\r\n\r\n=Physical Changes.= The word puberty is derived from the word _puber_,\r\nwhich in Latin means mature, ripe. But the word puber is itself\r\nderived from the word _pubes_, which in Latin means fine hair or\r\ndown. For at this period of maturity all mammals (that is animals\r\nwhich have breasts and nurse their young) begin to develop a growth of\r\nhair. You know that our entire body, with the exception of the palms\r\nof the hands and the soles of the feet, is covered with innumerable\r\nhair follicles, and from our birth our entire body, with the exception\r\nnamed, is covered with fine hair. The hair may be too delicate to be\r\nseen, but it is there, and with a magnifying glass you can see it\r\nwithout any trouble. But at puberty the hair increases in thickness\r\nand in quantity, and becomes abundant in places where it was hardly\r\nnoticeable before--the upper lip and face in boys, and the armpits and\r\nlower part of the abdomen in both boys and girls.\r\n\r\nAnd so the first apparent physical sign of puberty in a girl is the\r\ngradual appearance of hair in the armpits, on the mons Veneris and the\r\nlabia majora. But all the genital organs are undergoing rapid\r\ndevelopment; the vulva, the vagina, the uterus and the ovaries become\r\nlarger, and the ovaries which up to that time were elaborating an\r\ninternal secretion only, now also begin to manufacture ova; in other\r\nwords, the monthly process of ovulation is begun. Synchronously with\r\nthe process of ovulation, there commences the monthly function of\r\nmenstruation. The breasts also increase in size, assume the\r\ncharacteristic contour, develop their glandular substance, and become\r\ncapable of secreting milk for the use of any possible offspring.\r\nDuring this period of development they are often very sensitive to the\r\ntouch or feel painful without being touched.\r\n\r\nBut not only the genital organs undergo growth and development--the\r\nentire body participates in the process. The growth in height is the\r\nmost rapid at this period; the greatest growth takes place in the\r\nlimbs--legs and arms. The pelvis becomes broader, and the chest or\r\nthorax also becomes broader and larger. The muscles become larger and\r\nrounder and finally give the girl the beautiful womanly form.\r\n\r\n=Psychic Changes.= But the changes are not only physical; the changes\r\nthat take place in the girl's psychic sphere during the pubertal years\r\nare also highly important. That is the period of the development of\r\nthe emotions; she is overflowing with emotion; she becomes sensitive;\r\nin her relations with boys and men she becomes self-conscious.\r\nDistinct sexual desire fortunately does not make its appearance in the\r\ngirl at this period, as it does in the boy, but she becomes filled\r\nwith vague undefined and undefinable longings. It is the period of\r\n\"crushes\" when the girl is apt to bestow her overflowing emotion on a\r\ngirl friend. There is nothing reprehensible in these crushes--they\r\nact as a safety valve--and only in rare cases are they apt to lead to\r\nabnormal development. This is also the period of day-dreaming and of\r\nromancing; the girl likes to read love-stories and novels in which she\r\nidentifies herself with the heroine. And it makes quite some\r\ndifference as to what the girl reads during this period, for\r\nliterature has a strong influence on the young in the most plastic\r\nperiod of their lives; and it is important that older persons see to\r\nit that those in their care spend their time on books of noble ideals\r\nand high artistic value.\r\n\r\nGirls of a highly sensitive or so-called \"nervous\" temperament,\r\nespecially if there is \"nervousness\" in the family, must be\r\nparticularly looked after. For it is during the years of puberty and\r\nadolescence that any neurotic traits are apt to develop and become\r\nemphasized. It is also the period when bad sexual habits\r\n(masturbation) are apt to develop, and the careful mother will devote\r\nspecial attention to her girls in their years of puberty, and guard\r\nthem as much as possible against physical and emotional shocks.\r\n\r\nThe age of puberty in girls is by many writers considered as\r\nsynonymous or synchronous with the onset of menstruation, which in\r\nthis country in the majority of cases occurs between the ages of\r\nthirteen and fourteen. The year of gradual development before the\r\nonset of menstruation is by some referred to as the pre-pubertal year;\r\nand the first year after the onset of menstruation is the\r\npost-pubertal year. The period from puberty to full sexual maturity is\r\ncalled adolescence, and this term is applied generally to the period\r\nbetween thirteen and eighteen. For at eighteen the boy and the girl\r\nhave reached full maturity. Mentally we acquire things as long as we\r\nlive, and even physically the body gets larger for some years after\r\neighteen. But sexually both boys and girls are fully mature at\r\neighteen, though in order to become parents it is best, for various\r\nreasons, to wait to the ages of twenty or twenty-five.\r\n\r\n=Nubility.= Nubility is the age or state when a boy or a girl is \"fit\"\r\nfor marriage. This is a vague and unsatisfactory term. At the age of\r\nthirteen to fifteen boys and girls are physically \"fit\" for marriage,\r\nthat is at that age a boy is capable of begetting and a girl of having\r\nchildren. But it does not mean that it would be advisable for them to\r\nmarry at such an early age. Neither their bodies nor their minds are\r\nfully developed, and children begotten of such young parents are apt\r\nto be weaklings, both mentally and physically. The youngest age for\r\ngirls to marry should be eighteen, and for boys twenty; but the\r\nyoungest age for becoming parents should be twenty to twenty-two for\r\nthe mother and twenty-three to twenty-five for the father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\nMENSTRUATION\r\n\r\n Definition of Menstruation--Where Menstrual Blood Comes From--Age\r\n  of Menstruation--Age of Cessation of\r\n  Menstruation--Duration--Amount--Regularity and Irregularity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first function with which the girl will be confronted, which will\r\nimpress upon her that she is a creature of sex, that she is decidedly\r\ndifferent from the boy, is _menstruation_. And this function we will\r\nnow proceed to study.\r\n\r\nWhat is menstruation? Menstruation is a monthly discharge of blood.\r\nThe word is derived from the Latin word mensis, which means a month;\r\nand menstruation is also frequently spoken of as _the menses_. It is\r\nalso called the catamenia or catamenia-flow (Greek, kata--by, men--a\r\nmonth). Other terms are: the periods, courses, monthlies, turns,\r\nmonthly changes, monthly sickness, sickness, flowers, to be unwell, to\r\nbe regular. \"Not to see anything\" is a common term for having missed\r\nthe menses. This flow of blood recurs in most cases with remarkable\r\nregularity once a month; not a calendar month, but once a lunar month,\r\ni.e., once every twenty-eight days. And as there are thirteen lunar\r\nmonths a year, a woman menstruates not twelve but thirteen times a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nWhere does the menstrual blood come from? The menstrual blood comes\r\nfrom the inside of the womb. Every month, for a few days prior to\r\nmenstruation, the inside lining of the womb (what we call the mucous\r\nmembrane or endometrium) becomes congested and its bloodvessels become\r\ndistended with blood. If the woman has sexual intercourse and\r\npregnancy happens to take place, then this extra blood is used to\r\nnourish and develop the new child; but if no pregnancy takes place,\r\nthat extra blood exudes from the bloodvessels (some of the\r\nbloodvessels rupture) and is discharged from the uterus into the\r\nvagina, and from there to the outside, where it is caught on cotton,\r\nsanitary napkins or some other pad.\r\n\r\n=At what age does menstruation begin?= The usual age at which\r\nmenstruation begins in this country is thirteen or fourteen; in some\r\nit may occur as early as twelve, in others as late as fifteen, sixteen\r\nor even seventeen. For menstruation to begin earlier than twelve or\r\nlater than seventeen is in this country a rare exception. But in cold\r\nnorthern climates the age of eighteen is not rare, and in the hot\r\nsouthern climates menstruation often starts at the ages of ten or\r\neleven. Change of climate or of country will often have an influence\r\non the menses. In the early years of his medical practice, the author\r\nhad many Finnish girls as patients. It was a very common occurrence\r\nfor them to stop menstruating for the first few months or even for the\r\nfirst year of their residence in this country.\r\n\r\n=At what age does menstruation cease?= The age at which menstruation\r\nceases is called the _menopause_ or _climacteric_. It usually takes\r\nplace at the age of forty-eight or fifty. In some cases it does not\r\ntake place until the age of fifty-two, in others it takes place as\r\nearly as forty-five or forty-four. In general, it may be said that the\r\nwoman's menstruating period, during which she is able to have\r\nchildren, lasts about thirty-five years. And if no restraint be taken,\r\nand if no precautions be taken against conception, a woman could have\r\ntwenty or thirty children during her childbearing period.\r\n\r\n=How many days does a woman menstruate?= The usual number of days is\r\nfrom three to five; in some cases menstruation lasts only two days, in\r\nothers as long as seven. As a rule, the greatest amount of blood\r\npassed is during the first two days.\r\n\r\n=The amount of blood.= It is hard to estimate the exact amount of\r\nblood passed by a woman during her menses, but it reaches about an\r\nounce and a half to three ounces. In some women the amount may reach\r\nas much as four or five ounces and in exceptional cases as much as\r\neight ounces. Where it exceeds this amount, it is an abnormal\r\ncondition, requiring treatment. The usual statement that a normally\r\nmenstruating woman should not have to use more than three napkins\r\nduring the twenty-four hours is correct.\r\n\r\n_The periodical regularity_ with which menstruation recurs in many\r\nwomen is remarkable. I know a woman who has not missed her menses in\r\ntwenty years; during those twenty years the menses have started every\r\nfourth Friday, almost always at the same hour. I know another one who\r\nhas her menses every fourth Wednesday, about seven in the morning. She\r\nskipped her periods during her two pregnancies, then they were\r\nirregular for a while, then they came back to Wednesday. Other women\r\nhave their menses on a certain day of the month, say the first or the\r\nfifth, regardless of the number of days in the month (such cases are,\r\nhowever, exceptional). And in some women the menses are irregular:\r\nevery three weeks, every five or six weeks, every six or seven weeks,\r\netc. Some women never know when they may expect their menses, so\r\nirregular they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\nABNORMALITIES OF MENSTRUATION\r\n\r\n Disorders of Menstruation--Menorrhagia--Metrorrhagia--Amenorrhea--\r\n  Vicarious Menstruation--Dysmenorrhea of Organic and of Nervous\r\n  Origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many girls and women menstruation is a perfectly normal,\r\nphysiological process. They suffer no discomfort whatever from it.\r\nThey suffer no pains, no headache, no irritability, they have no\r\nadmonition of its onset, until they feel the blood oozing or trickling\r\nout. But, unfortunately, this is true only of a small percentage. The\r\nmajority of women have some unpleasant symptoms. Some have a headache\r\nfor a day or two, some complain of a dragging down sensation, some are\r\nirritable, feel depressed or quarrelsome; some have no appetite, no\r\nambition, no desire for work or company, while some girls have such\r\nsevere pains and cramps that they are obliged to go to bed for a day\r\nor two and call in medical aid.\r\n\r\nWhen the menstruation is very profuse, resembling more a hemorrhage\r\nthan normal menstruation, it is called _menorrhagia_; if the\r\nhemorrhage from the uterus occurs out of the regular menstrual\r\nperiods, it is called _metrorrhagia_. When the menses are skipped, or\r\nwhen they are so scanty that you can hardly notice any blood, we use\r\nthe term _amenorrhea_. In a few rare cases the menstruation instead of\r\ncoming normally from the uterus, comes from some other part of the\r\nbody, for instance, the nose. Some women have a hemorrhage from the\r\nnose every month. In some a bloody discharge may come from the\r\nbreasts. To such a substitute menstruation we apply the term\r\n_vicarious menstruation_. Such cases, however, are rare, and are mere\r\ncuriosities.\r\n\r\n=Dysmenorrhea.= I mentioned before that in some girls and women the\r\nmenses are accompanied by pains and cramps. This affliction, which is\r\nthe lot of millions of women, and from which men are entirely free, is\r\ncalled _dysmenorrhea_. Dysmenorrhea means painful and difficult\r\nmenstruation. A slight pain or at least a feeling of discomfort is\r\npresent in most cases of menstruation. But in many cases the pain is\r\nso severe, so _excruciating_, that the sufferer, girl or woman, is\r\nincapacitated for any work, and must go to bed for a day or two. In\r\nsome cases the pain is so severe as to necessitate the use of\r\nmorphine, and as it is a very bad thing to have to give morphine every\r\nthree or four weeks, every endeavor should be made to find out the\r\ncause of the trouble and to remove it. It is a mistake, however, to\r\nthink that all or even most cases of dysmenorrhea are due to some\r\nlocal trouble, that is, to an inflammation of the ovaries, or a\r\ndisplacement of the womb. Many cases of dysmenorrhea are of _nervous_\r\norigin; the cause resides in the central nervous system, and not in\r\nthe genital organs themselves. It is, therefore, not advisable to\r\nundertake any local treatment, unless a competent physician has made a\r\nthorough examination and has decided that local treatment is\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\nAs to the percentage of dysmenorrhea, a recent statistical examination\r\nof 4,000 women showed that dysmenorrhea of some degree was present in\r\nover one-half, namely, 52 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\nTHE HYGIENE OF MENSTRUATION\r\n\r\n Lack of Cleanliness During Menstrual Period--Superstitious\r\n  Beliefs--Hygiene of Menstruation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hygiene of menstruation can be expressed in two words: cleanliness\r\nand rest. Common sense would suggest these two measures, and as far as\r\nrest is concerned, many women do rest or take it easy while they are\r\nunwell. Some are forced to do it, because, if they don't, their\r\ndysmenorrhea is worse and the amount of blood they lose is\r\nconsiderably increased. The same cannot be said of cleanliness. Due\r\nundoubtedly to the superstitious opinions about menstruation, which\r\ncame over to us from the ages-of-long-ago, menstruation is still\r\nconsidered a _noli-me-tangere_, and women are afraid to bathe, to\r\ndouche or even to wash during the periods. And if there is any period\r\nwhen a woman needs a douche it is during menstruation. Any leucorrhea\r\nthat a woman may be suffering from becomes aggravated around the\r\nperiods; the menstrual blood of some women has a decided odor, and if\r\nno cleansing douche is taken during four or five days, some of the\r\nblood decomposes and acquires a decidedly offensive odor, which can be\r\nnoticed at some distance and to which some men and women are very\r\nsusceptible. There are some women who never take a vaginal douche.\r\nSome consider it a useless and unnecessary luxury; while some orthodox\r\npuritanical women consider it an ungodly procedure (forgetting that\r\ncleanliness is next to godliness) fit only for women of gay and\r\nquestionable character. If these orthodox women knew what was good for\r\nthem--and for their health--they would take a douche at least during\r\nmenstruation, if at no other time.\r\n\r\n=Cleanliness.= When the girl reaches the age of twelve or thirteen the\r\nmother should explain to her the phenomenon of menstruation and the\r\nlikelihood of its making its appearance in a short time. Of course she\r\nshould be told that there is nothing shameful in it, that when it\r\nmakes its appearance she should at once tell her mother, who will\r\ninstruct her what to do. She should be shown the use of sanitary\r\nnapkins. Rags, unless recently washed and kept wrapped up and\r\nprotected from dust, should not be used. Unclean rags may lead to\r\ninfection. I have no doubt that many cases of leucorrhea date back\r\ntheir origin to unwashed rags. Every morning and every evening the\r\ngirl should wash the external genitals with warm water, or plain soap\r\nand water. Married women should also take a douche once a day--the\r\ndouche may consist of two quarts of water in which has been dissolved\r\na teaspoonful of common table salt, or a tablespoonful of borax or\r\nboric acid. Such things like alum, potassium permanganate, carbolic\r\nacid, lactic acid, or tincture of iodine should only be used when\r\nthere is leucorrhea present and generally only under a physician's\r\ndirections. Bathing is permissible, but it is safe to use only a\r\nlukewarm bath. Cold tub baths, cold shower baths, as well as ocean and\r\nriver bathing are best avoided during the period; at least during the\r\nfirst two days. I do not give this as an absolute rule; I know women\r\nwho bathe and swim in the ocean during their menstrual periods without\r\nany injury to themselves, but they are exceptionally robust women;\r\nadvice in books is for the average person, and it is always best to be\r\non the safe side.\r\n\r\n=Rest.= Rest is just as important during menstruation as cleanliness,\r\nif not more so. Some women as mentioned before feel during their\r\nmenses just as well as they do at other times, and do not need any\r\nspecial hygiene. But these are in the minority. Most girls and women\r\ndo feel somewhat below par during that period, and it is very\r\nimportant that they take it easy, particularly during the first two\r\ndays. It is an outrage that many delicate, weak girls and women must\r\nstay on their feet all day or work on a machine when they should be at\r\nhome in bed or lying down on a couch.\r\n\r\nThe womb is congested during the period, is larger and heavier than\r\nnormal, and it is then that there is often laid the foundation for\r\nsome future uterine disease, the well-known \"womb trouble,\" or \"female\r\ndisease.\" It is not necessary that work be given up altogether, but\r\nthere certainly should be less of it and there should be as much rest\r\nas possible. For delicate and sensitive girls it is always best to\r\nstay away from school during the first and second days. Speaking again\r\nof the average and not the exception, it is best that dancing, bicycle\r\nriding, horseback riding, rowing, and other athletic exercises be\r\ngiven up altogether during the menses. Automobile riding and railroad\r\nand carriage travelling prove injurious in some instances, greatly\r\nincreasing the flow of blood.

Without\r\nit there would be no plants and no animals, excepting a few very low\r\nforms of no importance, and of course no human beings.\r\n\r\n=Fecundation= or fertilization is the process of union of the female\r\ngerm cell with the male germ cell; speaking of animals, it is the\r\nprocess of union of the egg or ovum of the female with the\r\nspermatozooen of the male. When a successful union of these two cells\r\ntakes place a new being is started. The process of fertilization or\r\nfecundation is also known as impregnation and conception. We say, to\r\nfertilize (chiefly, however, when speaking of plants) or to fecundate\r\nan ovum, or to impregnate a female or woman, and to conceive a child.\r\nWe say the woman has become impregnated or has conceived.\r\n\r\n_The Process._ The process of fecundation is briefly as follows. An\r\novum becomes mature, breaks through its Graafian follicle in the ovary\r\nand is set free. It is caught by the fimbriated or trumpet-shaped\r\nextremity of the Fallopian tube and, moved by the wave-like motion of\r\nthe cilia[4] of the lining of the tube, it begins its travel towards\r\nthe uterus. If no sexual intercourse has taken place nothing happens.\r\nThe ovum dries up, or \"dies,\" and either remains somewhere in the tube\r\nor womb or is removed from the latter with the menstruation, or mucous\r\ndischarge. But if intercourse has taken place, thousands and thousands\r\nof the male germ cells or spermatozoa enter the uterus through its\r\nopening or external os, and begin to travel upward in search of the\r\novum. The spermatozoa are capable of independent motion, and they\r\ntravel pretty fast. It is claimed that they can travel an inch in\r\nseven minutes, which is pretty fast when you take into consideration\r\nthat a spermatozooen is only 1/300 of an inch long. Many of the\r\nspermatozoa, weaker than the others, perish on the way, and only a few\r\ncontinue the journey up through the uterus to the tube. When near the\r\nlittle ovum, which remains passive, their movements become more and\r\nmore rapid, they seem to be attracted to it as if by a magnet, and\r\nfinally one spermatozooen--just one--the one that happens to be the\r\nstrongest or the nearest, makes a mad rush at it with its head,\r\nperforates it, and is completely swallowed up by it. As soon as the\r\nspermatozooen has been absorbed by the ovum, the opening through which\r\nit got in becomes tightly sealed up--a coagulation takes place near\r\nit--so that no other spermatozoa can enter the ovum. For if two or\r\nmore spermatozoa got into the same ovum a monstrosity would be apt to\r\nbe the result.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SPERMATOZOOeN PENETRATING THE OVUM.]\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of all the other spermatozoa? They perish. Only one is\r\nneeded. But in the ovum that has been impregnated, and which is now\r\ncalled an embryo, a feverish activity commences. First of all it looks\r\nfor a fixed place of abode. If the ovum happened to be in the uterus\r\nwhen the spermatozooen met and entered it, it remains there. It becomes\r\nattached to some spot in the lining of the womb and there it grows and\r\ndevelops, until at the end of nine months it has reached its full\r\ngrowth, and the womb opens and it comes out into the outside world. If\r\nthe ovum is in the Fallopian tube when the spermatozooen meets it, as\r\nis usually the case, it travels down to the uterus, and fixes itself\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n=Extra-Uterine Pregnancy.= The tube is a bad place for the ovum to\r\ngrow and develop, because the tube cannot stretch to such an extent as\r\nthe uterus can, nor can it furnish the embryo such good nourishment as\r\nthe uterus can. Occasionally, however, it happens that the impregnated\r\novum remains in the tube and develops there; we then have a case of\r\nwhat we call _extra-uterine_ (outside-of-the-uterus) or _tubal_\r\npregnancy. Extra-uterine pregnancy is also called _ectopic_ pregnancy,\r\nor ectopic gestation. Unless diagnosed early and operated upon, the\r\nwoman may be in great danger, for after a few weeks or months the tube\r\ngenerally ruptures.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the spermatozooen has entered the ovum, a process of\r\n_division_ or _segmentation_ commences. The ovum, which consists of\r\none cell, divides into two, the two into four, the four into eight,\r\nthe eight into sixteen, these into thirty-two, these into sixty-four,\r\n128, 256, 512, 1,024, until they can no longer be counted. This\r\nmulberry mass of cells arranges itself into two layers, with a cavity\r\nin between. And from these layers of cells there develop gradually all\r\norgans and tissues, until a fully formed and perfect child is the\r\nresult. If two ova are impregnated at the same time by two\r\nspermatozoa, the result is twins.[5]\r\n\r\nI might mention here that the moment the ovum is impregnated, i.e.,\r\njoined by a spermatozooen, it is called technically a zygote; it is\r\nalso called embryo, and this name is applied to it until the age of\r\nfive or six weeks. Some use the term embryo up to two or three months.\r\nAfter that, until it is born, it is called fetus.\r\n\r\nA study of the development of the embryo and the formation of the\r\nvarious organs from one single cell, the ovum, vitalized or fecundated\r\nby another single cell, the spermatozooen, is the most wonderful and\r\nmost fascinating of all studies. But that belongs to the domain of\r\nEmbryology, which is a separate science.\r\n\r\nWhat we see in the process of fecundation is a foreshadowing of the\r\nfuture man and woman. The ovum has no motion of its own, it is moved\r\nalong by the wave-like motions of the lining cells of the Fallopian\r\ntube, and throughout the entire act it remains passive. The\r\nspermatozooen, on the other hand, is in a state of continuous activity\r\nfrom the moment it has been ejaculated by the male until it has\r\nreached its goal--the ovum. And as the spermatozoa carry in them the\r\nentire impress of the man, and the ova of the woman, they foretell us\r\nthe fates of the future boy and girl. The woman's role throughout life\r\nis a passive and the man's an active one. And in choosing a mate the\r\nman will always be the active factor or pursuer. So biology seems to\r\ntell us. Whether education--using the word in its broadest sense--will\r\neffect a radical change in the relation of man and woman remains to be\r\nseen. A change putting the man and the woman on a footing of\r\n_equality_ would be desirable; but whether biological differences\r\nhaving their roots in the remotest antiquity can be obliterated, is a\r\nquestion the answer of which lies in the distant future. As Geddes and\r\nThomson so well said: The differences [between the sexes] may be\r\nexaggerated or lessened, but to obliterate them it would be necessary\r\nto have all the evolution over again on a new basis. What was decided\r\namong the prehistoric Protozoa cannot be annulled by act of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Hair-like appendages.\r\n\r\n[5] Each ovum has one germinal vesicle; occasionally one ovum may\r\ncontain two germinal vesicles; and from the impregnation of such an\r\novum a twin pregnancy may result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN\r\n\r\nPREGNANCY\r\n\r\n Period of Pregnancy in Human Female--Physiologic Process of\r\n  Pregnancy--Growth of Embryo from Moment of Conception--Pregnant\r\n  Woman Provides Nourishment for Two--Her Excreting Organs Must\r\n  Work for Two.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the ovum has been fertilized or fecundated by the\r\nspermatozooen, the woman is said to be pregnant (or in French\r\n_enceinte_. This term was used very frequently and is still used by\r\nprudes, who seem to consider the word pregnant vulgar and\r\ndisgraceful). Pregnancy, or the period of gestation, lasts from the\r\nmoment of conception to the moment that the fetus or child is expelled\r\nfrom the uterus. The period of pregnancy differs very widely in\r\ndifferent animals,[6] but in the human female it lasts nine calendar\r\nmonths or ten lunar months--from about 274 to 280 days. We usually\r\ncount 280 days from the _first_ day of the _last_ menstruation. A\r\npregnant woman generally wants to know the day of the expected\r\nconfinement--for this purpose a table is appended to this chapter. If\r\nyou know the first day of your last menstruation, you will see at a\r\nglance when the confinement may be expected. There may be a difference\r\nof a few days--either before or after the expected date--but for\r\npractical approximate purposes the tables serve very well.\r\n\r\nA simple way is to count back three months and add seven days. For\r\ninstance, a woman's last menstruation occurred on April 4th; counting\r\nback three months gives you January 4th; add seven days and you get\r\nJanuary 11th, the probable date of delivery. The first day of the last\r\nmenstruation was December 30th; counting back three months gives you\r\nSeptember 30th; add seven days and you get October 6th, the probable\r\ndate of delivery. The presence of a short month like February may be\r\ndisregarded, as the calculation is not absolutely, but only\r\napproximately correct.\r\n\r\nThe period at which the child's movements begin to be felt by the\r\nmother is termed Quickening. It usually occurs at the middle of the\r\npregnancy, between the 16th and 18th week.\r\n\r\nPregnancy is a normal physiological process; but every active\r\nphysiological process is apt to be accompanied by disturbances, and\r\nthere is certainly no process in the animal body in which greater\r\nactivity, greater changes, go on than during the process of pregnancy.\r\nJust see what occurs in nine months. The uterus, at first the size of\r\na small pear, reaches a size larger than that of the head of a big\r\nman; it does not merely stretch, as some think, but it actually grows\r\nenormously in size, the muscular walls of a pregnant uterus being many\r\ntimes thicker than those of a non-pregnant one. They have to be or\r\nthey would not have the strength to expel the child, when the proper\r\ntime comes. It is to be borne in mind that the child does not slip out\r\nby itself; it is the powerful muscular contractions of the uterus that\r\npush it out. If the uterus should refuse to work, if its walls were\r\ntoo thin or too weak, the child could not come out, but would have to\r\nbe taken out with forceps. Still greater changes than in the uterus\r\ntake place in the child itself. At the moment of conception it is the\r\nsize of _the head of a pin_; at the moment of birth it weighs from\r\nseven to ten pounds; at the moment of conception it is a minute,\r\nundifferentiated mass of protoplasm, just a single fertilized cell; at\r\nthe moment of birth it consists of millions and millions of cells,\r\nwhich have become differentiated into numerous harmoniously working\r\norgans, and different tissues, such as brain and nerve tissue,\r\nmuscular tissue, connective tissue, bone, cartilage, etc., etc. A\r\ntruly wonderful process. And in the meantime this child, which is\r\nbiologically a parasite (though it is not a nice name to call it by)\r\ndraws its sustenance from the mother's blood, and the mother has to\r\nprovide nourishment for two. And, besides providing nourishment, her\r\nexcreting organs, her kidneys, must work for two, because her system\r\nhas also to get rid of the child's excretions. No wonder that the\r\npregnant woman, particularly under an artificial unhealthy mode of\r\nliving, is subject to many troubles and disturbances.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR.

menstruation runs a perfectly smooth course,\r\nfree from any disagreeable symptoms. The same is true of pregnancy. It\r\nis remarkable how smooth and easy the entire course is with some\r\nwomen. Many women know that they are pregnant only because of the\r\nnon-appearance of the monthly periods; and even in the later months\r\nthey feel no discomfort, attending to all their work and pleasures as\r\nusual; and even childbirth is a trifling matter with them.\r\nUnfortunately the number of such women is not very large, and,\r\nbecause of our confined, unnatural, often exhausting way of living,\r\nis becoming smaller and smaller. There is no question that the\r\ncivilized, refined woman has a harder ordeal in pregnancy and\r\nchildbirth than has her primitive sister. We confidently hope that\r\nthis will not be so in the future; we expect the time to come when\r\ntrue hygiene will be an integral part of the education and the life of\r\nevery girl, and then pregnancy and parturition may become even easier\r\nprocesses than they are in the primitive races. But the time is not\r\nyet; and in the meantime our young women have a good deal to go\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n=Morning Sickness.= One of the commonest disorders of pregnancy is the\r\nso-called morning sickness. This consists in a feeling of nausea and\r\nvomiting, which comes on soon after getting up. The morning sickness\r\nmakes its first appearance in the third, fourth or fifth week of\r\npregnancy and lasts usually until the end of the third or fourth\r\nmonth. In some women, however, the morning sickness comes on in a few\r\ndays after impregnation has taken place, and those women diagnose\r\ntheir condition unmistakably by the feeling of slight nausea which\r\nthey experience on getting up. Medicines are as a rule of little use\r\nin treating morning sickness. The \"disease\" can be relieved but not\r\ncured. The patient should stay in bed later than usual, should have\r\nher breakfast in bed, and then not get up for about half an hour\r\nafterward. If the patient is anemic, a good iron preparation may prove\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n=Pernicious Vomiting.= The vomiting of pregnancy sometimes becomes so\r\nsevere and uncontrollable that it has been given the name pernicious.\r\nThe patient is unable to retain any kind of food, not even liquids,\r\nvomits almost incessantly, and may become very much run down and\r\nexhausted. The vomited matter may contain blood. For this condition a\r\ncompetent physician must be consulted, for in some cases the patient's\r\nlife may be in danger and an abortion has to be performed.\r\n\r\n=Capricious Appetite.= A capricious appetite is very common in\r\npregnancy. The capriciousness may express itself in four different\r\ndirections: (1) The patient may lose her appetite, almost altogether,\r\npartaking only of very little food, and that with effort. This\r\ncondition of loss of appetite is called anorexia. (2) The patient may\r\ndevelop an enormous appetite--what we call bulimia--eating several\r\ntimes as much as she does ordinarily. (3) She may develop an aversion\r\ntowards certain articles of food. Thus many women develop an aversion\r\ntowards meat, the mere sight of or talk about meat causing in them a\r\nsensation of nausea. (4) She may show a craving for the most peculiar\r\narticles of food and for articles which are not food at all. The\r\ncraving for sour pickles or sour cabbage is well-known; but some women\r\nwill eat chalk, sand, and even more peculiar things (for the chalk\r\nthere may be a reason: the system needs an extra amount of lime and\r\nchalk is carbonate of lime).\r\n\r\n=Constipation.= Constipation is very common among women in the\r\nnon-pregnant condition; but in the pregnant it is much more common and\r\nmuch more aggravated. Constipation must be guarded against, but the\r\nmeasures must be of a mild nature. If we can relieve the constipation\r\nby dietary measures alone, so much the better. The dietary measures\r\nshould consist in eating plenty of fruit--prunes, apples, figs, dates,\r\netc., and coarse bread and bran. Constipating articles, such as cheese\r\nor coffee, should be eliminated. Where dietary measures alone are\r\ninsufficient, the patient should take an enema--a rectal\r\ninjection--twice or three times a week. The enema should consist of\r\nabout 8 ounces (half a pint) of cold or lukewarm water containing a\r\npinch of salt, and should be retained about ten minutes. Instead of\r\nwater, we may advise an occasional enema of two to four drams of\r\nglycerin. Or instead of a glycerin enema, a glycerin suppository may\r\nbe used. If internal laxatives are to be used, only the mildest and\r\nnon-griping preparations should be employed The best are: a good\r\nmineral oil--one or two tablespoonfuls on going to bed, or fluid\r\nextract of cascara sagrada, one-half to one teaspoonful on going to\r\nbed. It is very important, whatever we use, _not_ to use the same\r\nthing for a long time. If the same drug or measure is used without any\r\nchange, the bowels get used to it and cease to respond and we have to\r\nuse larger and larger doses. In fighting constipation we must\r\ntherefore constantly change our weapons: one night we use mineral oil,\r\nthe next night cascara sagrada, the third night an enema, the fourth\r\nnight a glycerin injection or suppository, the fifth night perhaps\r\nnothing at all, the sixth night a blue mass pill, the seventh morning\r\na Seidlitz powder, then a rest for a day or two, then a repetition of\r\nthe same measures. But always remember: first try to get along without\r\nany drugs at all. Many cases can get relieved of their constipation by\r\na proper change in diet alone. And where this is impossible, then use\r\nmild laxatives and use them interchangeably.\r\n\r\n=Toothache= is not uncommon in pregnancy, and a pregnant woman should\r\nhave her teeth put in first-class condition.\r\n\r\n=Difficulty in Urination.= Pregnant women often suffer with frequency\r\nand urgency of urination. Some have to urinate, while they are on\r\ntheir feet, every few minutes. This is due to the fact that during\r\nthe first two or three months of pregnancy the uterus is not only\r\nenlarged but is also _anteverted_, that is _turned forward_ and\r\n_presses down_ upon the bladder. When the woman is lying down the\r\npressure on the bladder is relieved, and she does not have to urinate\r\nfrequently. This pressure lasts only the first two or three months,\r\nbecause after that the growing womb lifts itself out of the pelvis,\r\nrising into the abdominal cavity; it is no longer anteverted and the\r\npressure on the bladder is relieved. During the last months of the\r\npregnancy there is again frequent urination, because then the heavy\r\nuterus sinks again into the pelvic cavity and presses upon the\r\nbladder. The treatment for this frequent urination consists in wearing\r\na well fitting abdominal belt or corset, which raises the uterus and\r\nprevents pressure on the bladder. Sometimes a pessary which prevents\r\nthe anteversion is efficient. In all cases lying down and resting is\r\nuseful. In short, keeping off one's feet is the most efficient remedy\r\nfor the treatment of frequent urination in pregnant women.\r\n\r\n=Hemorrhoids= (Piles). On account of the pressure of the womb on the\r\nrectum, and also on account of the constipation which is so frequent\r\nduring pregnancy, hemorrhoids or piles are quite frequent among\r\npregnant women. The treatment of hemorrhoids consists in removing the\r\ncause: wearing a well-fitting abdominal belt, and relieving the\r\nconstipation. Injecting into the rectum about half a pint of cold\r\nwater three times a day is very useful. For the intolerable itching\r\nsometimes present in hemorrhoids the following ointment will be found\r\nvery grateful: menthol, 5 grains; calomel, 10 grains; bismuth\r\nsubnitrate, 30 grains; resorcin, 10 grains; oil of cade, 15 grains;\r\ncold cream, one ounce. The piles (the hemorrhoids) are to be well\r\ncleansed with hot water, and this ointment is to be well smeared over;\r\na little is pushed into the rectum, and a piece of cotton is put over\r\nthe anus. This protects the clothes from soiling and keeps the\r\nmedicine in place for a longer time. Instead of ointment a cocoa\r\nbutter suppository may be used. A suppository of the following\r\ncomposition is good: powdered nutgalls, 3 grains; oil of cade, 3\r\ndrops; resorcin, 1 grain; bismuth subnitrate, 5 grains; cocoa butter,\r\n20 grains. One such suppository to be inserted three times a day. The\r\nointment and the suppository given above, if used in conjunction with\r\nthe proper regulation of the bowels, will not only relieve but will\r\ncure most cases of hemorrhoids caused by pregnancy.\r\n\r\n=Itching of the Vulva. Pruritus Vulvae.= Itching of the external\r\ngenitals during pregnancy is not uncommon. This may be due to the\r\nfact that the vulva is generally congested and swollen during\r\npregnancy or it may be caused by an increased leucorrheal discharge.\r\nThe itching is sometimes very severe, and if the patient scratches\r\nwith her nails and produces bleeding, she may cause an infection of\r\nthe parts. The patient should be cautioned against scratching; she\r\nshould try simple measures to relieve the itching. A small towel or\r\ngauze compress wrung out of boiling water and applied to the vulva\r\nseveral times a day, followed by a free application of stearate of\r\nzinc powder is often efficient. If it is not, the following salve may\r\nbe tried: carbolic acid, 10 grains; menthol, 5 grains; resorcin, 15\r\ngrains; zinc oxide, 1 dram; and white vaseline, one ounce. In very\r\nsevere cases the vulva should be painted with a solution of silver\r\nnitrate, 25 grains to 1 ounce of distilled water.\r\n\r\n=Varicose Veins.= In most women during pregnancy the veins in the legs\r\nbecome somewhat enlarged. This is due to the pressure of the womb,\r\nwhich interferes with the circulation. If the veins become very\r\nprominent, swollen and tortuous, they are called varicose. This\r\ncondition should be prevented, because it often and to some degree\r\nalways persists permanently even after the pregnancy is over. The best\r\nprecautionary measure is for the woman to wear a well-fitting\r\nabdominal belt or maternity corset, which supports the womb and does\r\nnot permit it to sink too low into the pelvis. If varicose veins have\r\nbeen permitted to develop, the woman should wear well-fitting rubber\r\nstockings, or at least have the legs bandaged with woven elastic\r\nbandages. The bandage must be applied by a competent person, uniformly\r\nand not too tightly. Constipation has also a bad effect in making\r\nvaricose veins worse; the bowels should therefore also be looked\r\nafter. In some severe cases all measures are of little value unless\r\nthe patient at the same time stays in bed or on a couch for a few\r\ndays, with the legs elevated.\r\n\r\nSwelling of the feet should be at once attended to. It may be a\r\ntrifling matter due only to pressure of the womb; then again it may be\r\ndue to some kidney trouble. The physician will determine the true\r\ncause and prescribe the appropriate treatment.\r\n\r\n=Liver Spots. Chloasma.= In some cases irregular brownish patches or\r\nsplotches develop on the skin around the breasts, on the sides, or on\r\nthe face. These patches are known popularly as liver spots or in\r\nmedical language as _chloasma_. Nothing can be done for them, but they\r\ngenerally disappear after the pregnancy is over. A few patches here\r\nand there may remain permanently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE\r\n\r\nWHEN TO ENGAGE A PHYSICIAN\r\n\r\n Necessity for the Pregnant Woman Immediately Placing Herself Under\r\n  Care of Physician and Remaining Under His Care During Entire\r\n  Period.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe disorders and disturbances described above are, with the exception\r\nof pernicious vomiting, of a minor nature. They are annoying, may\r\ncause considerable discomfort and suffering, but they do not endanger\r\nthe life of the woman or of the child. Occasionally, however,\r\nfortunately not very often, the kidneys become affected, and for this\r\ncondition treatment by a physician is absolutely necessary. In fact,\r\nthe correct and safe thing for a woman to do is to consult a physician\r\nas soon as she knows she is pregnant, and have him take care of her\r\nduring the entire pregnancy. Some women engage a physician during the\r\neighth or ninth month and this is decidedly wrong, because it may then\r\nbe too late to correct certain troubles which if taken at the outset\r\ncould have been easily cured; while many troubles in the hands of a\r\ncompetent physician can be prevented altogether. I must therefore\r\nreiterate: every woman should engage a physician from the beginning\r\nof her pregnancy, or at least during the third or fourth and certainly\r\nnot later than the fifth month. He will examine the urine every month\r\nand make sure that the kidneys are in order, he will make sure that\r\nthe child is in a normal position, and will prevent a host of other\r\nills.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: POSITION OF THE CHILD IN THE WOMB.]\r\n\r\nThis is not a special treatise on the management of pregnancy, and\r\ntherefore minute details are out of place. Besides, to the details the\r\nphysician will attend. But some hints regarding diet and general\r\nhygiene will prove useful.\r\n\r\nIf everything is satisfactory, if there is no severe vomiting, kidney\r\ntrouble, etc., the usual mixed diet may continue. The only changes I\r\nwould make are the following: Drink plenty of hot water during entire\r\ncourse of pregnancy: a glass or two in the morning, two or three\r\nglasses in the afternoon, the same at night. From six to twelve\r\nglasses may be consumed. Also plenty of milk, buttermilk and fermented\r\nmilk. Plenty of fruit and vegetables. Meat only once a day. For the\r\ntendency to constipation, whole wheat bread, rye bread, bread baked of\r\nbran or bran with cream.\r\n\r\nAs to exercise, either extreme must be avoided. Some women think that\r\nas soon as they become pregnant, they must not move a muscle; they are\r\nto be put in a glass case, and kept there to the day of delivery.\r\nOther women, on the other hand, of the ultramodern type, indulge in\r\nstrenuous exercise and go out on long fatiguing walks up to the last\r\nday. Either extreme is injurious. The right way is moderate exercise,\r\nand short, non-fatiguing walks.\r\n\r\nBathing may be kept up to the day of delivery. But warm baths,\r\nparticularly during the last two or three months, are preferable to\r\ncold baths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n\r\nTHE SIZE OF THE FETUS\r\n\r\n Approximately Correct Measurements and Weight of Fetus at End of\r\n  Each Month of Pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMen and women are always interested to know how large the fetus is and\r\nhow far it is developed during the various months of pregnancy.\r\nAbsolutely exact measurements cannot be given, but the following\r\napproximate measurements are correct:\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: 1. EMBRYO BETWEEN ONE AND TWO WEEKS OLD.\r\n   2. EMBRYO ABOUT FOUR WEEKS OLD.\r\n   3. EMBRYO ABOUT SIX WEEKS OLD.\r\n   (Illustrations are double the actual size.)]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first month (lunar) it is about the size of a\r\nhazelnut. Weighs about 15 grains.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second month it is the size of a small hen's egg.\r\nThe internal organs are partially formed, it begins to assume a human\r\nshape, but the sex cannot yet be differentiated. Up to the fifth or\r\nsixth week it does not differ much in appearance from the embryos of\r\nother animals.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the third month it is the size of a large goose egg; it\r\nis about two to three and a half inches long. Weighs about one ounce.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fourth month the fetus is between six and seven\r\ninches long and weighs about five ounces.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fifth month the fetus is between seven and eleven\r\ninches long, and weighs eight to ten ounces.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the sixth month it is eleven to thirteen inches long and\r\nweighs one and one-half to two pounds. If born, is capable of living a\r\nfew minutes, and it is reported that some six months' children have\r\nbeen incubated.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the seventh month the fetus is from thirteen to fifteen\r\nor sixteen inches long and weighs about three pounds. Is capable of\r\nindependent life, but must be brought up with great care, usually in\r\nan incubator.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eighth month the length is from fifteen to\r\nseventeen inches, and weight from three to five pounds.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the ninth month the length of the fetus is from sixteen\r\nto seventeen and one-half inches, and weight from five to seven\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the tenth lunar month (at birth) the length of the child\r\nis from seventeen to nineteen inches and the weight from six to twelve\r\npounds; the average is seven and a quarter, but there are full term\r\nchildren weighing less than six pounds and more than twelve; but these\r\nare exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\r\n\r\nTHE AFTERBIRTH (PLACENTA) AND CORD\r\n\r\n How the Afterbirth Develops--Bag of Waters--Umbilical Cord--The\r\n  Navel--Fetus Nourished by Absorption--Fetus Breathes by Aid of\r\n  Placenta--No Nervous Connection Between Mother and Child.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever part of the womb the ovum attaches itself to is stimulated to\r\nintense activity, to growth. Numerous bloodvessels begin to grow and\r\nthat part of the lining membrane with its numerous bloodvessels\r\nconstitute the placenta, or as it is commonly called _afterbirth_,\r\nbecause it comes out _after_ the _birth_ of the child. From the\r\nplacenta there is also reflected a membrane over the ovum, so as to\r\ngive it additional protection. That membrane forms a complete bag over\r\nthe fetus; this bag becomes filled with liquid, so that the fetus\r\nfloats freely in a bag of waters; this bag bursts only during\r\nchildbirth. The fetus is not attached close to the placenta, but is,\r\nso to say, suspended from it by a _cord_, which is called the\r\n_umbilical cord_. When the child is born, the umbilical cord is cut,\r\nand the scar or depression in the abdomen where the umbilical cord\r\nwas attached constitutes the navel or umbilicus (in slang\r\nlanguage--button or belly button). The umbilical cord consists of two\r\narteries and one vein embedded in a gelatin like substance and\r\nenveloped by a membrane, and it is through the umbilical cord that the\r\nblood from the placenta is brought to and carried from the fetus. The\r\nblood of the fetus and the blood of the mother do not mix; the\r\nbloodvessels are separated by thin walls, and it is through these thin\r\nwalls that the fetal blood receives the ingredients it needs from the\r\nmother's blood. In other words, it receives its nourishment from the\r\nmother by _absorption_ or _osmosis_. The blood from the placenta also\r\nfurnishes the fetal blood with oxygen, so that the fetus breathes by\r\nthe aid of the placenta, and not through its own lungs.\r\n\r\nIt is well to remember that there is absolutely no nervous connection\r\nbetween mother and child. There are no nerves whatever in the\r\numbilical cord, so that the nervous systems of the fetus and of the\r\nmother are entirely distinct and separate. And this will explain why\r\ncertain nervous impressions and shocks received by the mother are not\r\nreadily transmitted to the child. It is only through changes in the\r\nmother's blood that the fetus can be influenced. As will be seen in a\r\nlater chapter we are skeptical about \"maternal impressions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\r\n\r\nLACTATION OR NURSING\r\n\r\n No Perfect Substitute for Mother's Milk--When Nursing is Injurious\r\n  to Mother and Child--Modified Milk--Artificial Foods--Care\r\n  Essential in Selecting Wet Nurse--Suckling Child Benefits\r\n  Mother--Reciprocal Affection Strengthened by Nursing--Sexual\r\n  Feelings While Nursing--Alcoholics are Injurious--Attention to\r\n  Condition of Nipples During Pregnancy Essential--Treatment of\r\n  Sunken Nipples--Treatment of Tender Nipples--Treatment of Cracked\r\n  Nipples--How to Stop the Secretion of Milk When Necessary--\r\n  Menstruation While Nursing--Pregnancy in the Nursing Woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery mother should nurse her child--if she can. There is no perfect\r\nsubstitute for mother's milk. There is only one excuse for a mother\r\nnot nursing--that is when she has no milk, or when the quality of the\r\nmilk is so poor that the child does not thrive on it, or when the\r\nmother is run down, is threatened with or is suffering with\r\ntuberculosis, etc. In such cases the nursing would prove injurious to\r\nboth mother and child.\r\n\r\nWhen the mother cannot nurse the child, it should be brought up\r\nartificially on modified cow's milk. Formulas for modified milk have\r\nbeen worked out for every month of the child's life, and if the\r\nformulas are carefully followed, and the bottle and nipples are\r\nproperly sterilized, the child should have no trouble, but should\r\nthrive and grow like on good mother's milk. If the child is sickly or\r\ndelicate and does not thrive on modified cow's milk or on the other\r\nartificial foods, such as Horlick's malted milk, or Nestle's food,\r\nthen a wet nurse may become necessary. But before engaging a wet nurse\r\ngreat care should be taken to make sure that she is healthy, that the\r\nage of her child is approximately the same as the age of the child\r\nwhich she is about to nurse, and particularly that she is free from\r\nany syphilitic taint. One, two or more Wassermann tests should be made\r\nto settle the question definitely.\r\n\r\nMothers should bear in mind that suckling the child is good not only\r\nfor the child, but for the mother as well. Lactation helps the\r\n_involution_ of the uterus: the uterus of a nursing mother returns\r\nmore quickly and more perfectly to its normal ante-pregnant condition\r\nthan the uterus of the mother who cannot or will not nurse her child.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted that the reciprocal affection between mother and child\r\nis greater in cases in which the child suckled its mother's breast.\r\nThis is quite likely. It is also asserted that the nursing mother\r\ntransmits certain traits to its child, which the non-nursing mother\r\ncannot. This is merely a hypothesis without any scientific proof.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the statement that many women experience decidedly\r\npleasurable sexual feelings while nursing seems to be well\r\nsubstantiated.\r\n\r\nThat the mother who nurses her child should partake of sufficient\r\nnourishment goes without saying. But the advice often given to nursing\r\nmothers to partake of beer, ale or wine is a bad one. It is a question\r\nif a mother partaking of considerable quantities of alcoholic\r\nbeverages may not transmit the taste for alcohol to her children. No,\r\nalcoholics should be left alone, but milk, eggs, meat, fruit and\r\nvegetables should be partaken of in abundance.\r\n\r\n=Preparing the Nipples.= For the infant to be able to nurse properly\r\nthe nipples of the breast must be in good condition. If the nipples\r\nare sunken, depressed, it is torture for the child to nurse. It uses\r\nup a lot of energy uselessly, becomes exhausted, and gets very little\r\nmilk; while if the nipples be tender or cracked the process of nursing\r\nis a torture for the mother.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore necessary to attend to the nipples in due time--to\r\nbegin at the fifth or sixth month is not too early. If the nipples are\r\nsufficiently prominent, little need be done for them except to wash\r\nthem with a little boric acid solution (one teaspoonful of boric acid\r\nto a glass of water) occasionally, and now and then to rub in a little\r\npetrolatum, plain or borated. But if the nipples are sunken so that\r\nthey are below the surface of the breast, or if they are only slightly\r\nabove the surface of the breast, they must be treated. Gentle traction\r\nmust be made on them with the fingers three or four times a day. There\r\nare only a few cases where persistent manipulation will not develop\r\nthe nipple and make it stand out prominently.\r\n\r\nIf the nipple is tender it should be washed two or three times a day\r\nwith a mixture of alcohol and water; one part of alcohol to three\r\nparts of water is sufficient. In washing the nipple with this diluted\r\nalcohol it should be dried and a little petrolatum or vaseline rubbed\r\nin. This done two or three times a day during the last month or two of\r\nthe pregnancy will generally produce a good healthy nipple.\r\n\r\n=The Treatment of Cracked Nipples.= If the care of the nipple has been\r\nneglected, and it develops cracks or fissures so that the nursing of\r\nthe child causes the mother severe pain, the nursing should be done\r\nthrough a nipple shield, and in the meantime between the nursings the\r\nnipple should be rubbed with the following preparation, which is\r\nexcellent and which I can fully recommend: thymol iodide, 1/2 dram;\r\nolive oil, 1/2 ounce. This should be applied every hour to the nipple\r\nand covered with a little cotton; before each nursing, however, it\r\nmust be well washed off with warm water or warm boric acid solution.\r\nWhen the nipples are cracked, the infant's lips should also before\r\nnursing be carefully wiped out with boric acid solution. For the\r\nbaby's mouth contains bacteria which while harmless in themselves may\r\nif they get into the cracks of the nipple set up an inflammation of\r\nthe breast or \"mastitis\" and cause an abscess. If the cracks are\r\nexcruciatingly painful, as they sometimes are, it is necessary to give\r\nthe one breast a rest for twenty-four hours and have the child nurse\r\nat the other until the cracks have partially healed.\r\n\r\n=When It Is Necessary to Dry Up the Breasts.= In case of the death of\r\nthe child, or if the mother for some other reason finds herself unable\r\nto nurse, such as in cases where there is absolutely no nipple,\r\ninstead of the prominence of the nipple there being a deep depression,\r\nit becomes necessary to stop the secretion of the milk, or as it is\r\nsaid in common parlance, \"to dry up the breasts.\" In former days, not\r\nso very long ago, and the practice is still common enough to call\r\nattention to it and to condemn it, the breasts used to be tightly\r\nbandaged, or they used to be pumped every few hours. The first causes\r\nunnecessary pain and trouble, while the second procedure, the pumping,\r\ndoes exactly the reverse to what it is intended to do. Instead of\r\ndrying up the breasts it keeps up the secretion. The best thing to do\r\nin a case like that is to leave the breasts alone, not to pump them,\r\nbut just gently support them with a bandage and then in three or four\r\ndays the secretion of the milk will gradually disappear. There is some\r\ndiscomfort the first twenty-four or forty-eight hours, but if left\r\nalone the discomfort is less than if the breasts are manipulated,\r\nbandaged or pumped.\r\n\r\n=Menstruation or Pregnancy While Nursing.= Many women do not\r\nmenstruate and do not become pregnant while they are nursing. Some\r\nwomen will not conceive, no matter how long they may nurse the\r\nchild--a year or two or longer. And some women take advantage of this\r\nfact, and in order to avoid another child they will keep up the\r\nnursing as long as possible. In Egypt and other Oriental countries\r\nwhere our means for the prevention of conception are unknown, it is no\r\nrare sight to see a child three or four years old interrupting his\r\nwork or his play and running up to suckle his mother's breast. But not\r\nall women have this good luck. Some women (about fifty per cent.)\r\nbegin to menstruate in the sixth month of lactation, while some become\r\npregnant even before they begin to menstruate. It only too often\r\nhappens that a woman considering lactation her safeguard omits to use\r\nany precautions and finds herself, to her great discomfiture, in a\r\npregnant condition.\r\n\r\nWhen a nursing woman discovers that she is pregnant she should give up\r\nnursing at once. The milk is apt to become of poor quality, but even\r\nwhere this is not the case, it is too much for a woman to feed one\r\nchild in the uterus and one at the breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\r\n\r\nABORTION AND MISCARRIAGE\r\n\r\n Definition of Word Abortion--Definition of Word Miscarriage--\r\n  Spontaneous Abortion--Induced Abortion--Therapeutic Abortion--\r\n  Criminal Abortion--Missed Abortion--Habitual Abortion--Syphilis\r\n  as Cause of Abortion and Miscarriage--Dangers of Abortion--\r\n  Abortion an Evil.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word abortion, used somewhat loosely, signifies the premature\r\nexpulsion of the fetus; the expulsion of the fetus from the womb\r\nbefore it is viable, i.e., before it is capable of living\r\nindependently. Used in a stricter sense, the word abortion is applied\r\nto the expulsion of the fetus up to the end of the 16th week; to the\r\nexpulsion of the fetus between the 16th and the 28th week the term\r\nmiscarriage is applied; and when the expulsion of the fetus takes\r\nplace after the 28th week, but before full term, we use the term\r\npremature labor. The laity does not like the term abortion, as it is\r\nunder the impression that the term always signifies criminal abortion;\r\nit therefore prefers to use the term miscarriage (\"miss\"), regardless\r\nof the time at which the expulsion of the fetus takes place.\r\n\r\nWhen an abortion (or miscarriage) takes place by itself, without any\r\noutside aid, we call it _spontaneous abortion_. When it is brought on\r\nby artificial means, whether by the woman herself or by somebody else,\r\nwe call it _induced_ abortion. When an abortion is induced for the\r\npurpose of saving the woman's life, we call it _therapeutic_ abortion;\r\nthis is considered perfectly legal and proper. But where an abortion\r\nis induced merely to save an unmarried mother's reputation, or because\r\nthe married mother is too poor or too weak to have any more children,\r\nor is reluctant to have any (or any more) for any other reason, it is\r\ncalled _criminal_ or _illegal_ abortion, and, if discovered, subjects\r\nthe mother and the person who produced the abortion to severe\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nWhen the fetus for some reason dies in its mother's womb, it is\r\ngenerally expelled within a few hours or days. Sometimes this is not\r\nthe case, and the dead fetus is retained for several weeks, or months\r\nor even years; to such a phenomenon we apply the term _missed_\r\nabortion. Some women suffer from what might be called the abortion\r\nhabit; they can hardly ever carry a child to full term, but lose it in\r\nthe same month or even in the same week of gestation during each\r\npregnancy; we call this habitual abortion. And this habitual abortion\r\nmay be independent of disease, such, for instance, as syphilis. The\r\nterms _threatened_, _imminent_ and _inevitable_ abortion require no\r\nfurther explanation.\r\n\r\n=The Causes of Abortion.= Outside of the abortion habit, which may be\r\ndue partly to heredity or be caused by a diseased condition of the\r\nlining membrane of the uterus, the principal cause of abortion and\r\nmiscarriage is syphilis. And when a woman has had two or three or four\r\nor more miscarriages in succession we generally assume the cause to be\r\nsyphilis, and in most cases the assumption will be correct.\r\n\r\nWhen an abortion is performed by an experienced physician, with the\r\nobservance of the utmost cleanliness (asepsis and antisepsis), then\r\nthe abortion is accompanied with very little or no danger; but when\r\nperformed carelessly, by incompetent, non-conscientious physicians and\r\nmidwives, the operation is fraught with great danger to the patient's\r\nhealth or to her very life. And abortion is a great cause of premature\r\ndeath and chronic invalidism among women. And as long as the people\r\nwill remain ignorant of the proper means of regulating their\r\noffspring, so long will abortion thrive.\r\n\r\nWhile I recognize that there are cases in which the performance of an\r\nabortion is perfectly justifiable from a moral standpoint, for\r\ninstance in cases of rape or where the mother is unmarried,\r\nnevertheless abortion must be recognized as an evil, a necessary evil\r\nnow and then, but an evil, nevertheless. It is never to be undertaken\r\nlightly, or to be considered in a frivolous spirit; and it is the duty\r\nof all serious-minded and humanitarian men and women to do everything\r\nin their power to remove those conditions which make abortion\r\nnecessary and unavoidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\r\n\r\nPRENATAL CARE\r\n\r\n Meaning of the Term--Misleading Information by Quasi-Scientists--\r\n  Exaggerated Ideas Regarding Prenatal Care--Nervous Connection\r\n  Between Mother and Child--Cases Under Author's Observation--Effects\r\n  on Offspring--Advice to Pregnant Women--Germ-plasm of Chronic\r\n  Alcoholic--A Glass of Wine and the Spermatozoa--False Statements--\r\n  Cases of Violence and Accidents During Pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy prenatal care we understand the care taken during pregnancy before\r\nthe child is born. Used in a wider sense the term includes the care\r\nwhich both parents should take of themselves even before the child is\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\nOf course the father and the mother should be in the best possible\r\nphysical and mental condition during the time of conception and even\r\nbefore conception, and the mother should take the very best care of\r\nherself--she should be in good health and as calm a spirit as possible\r\nduring the entire period of gestation. For the general health and\r\ncondition of the mother does influence the child.\r\n\r\nAnd still I feel impelled to say something which may meet with violent\r\nopposition in some quarters. The trouble is, there are too many\r\nhalf-baked scientists in our midst. They spread misleading information\r\nand the public at large is too apt to take every statement that has a\r\nquasi-scientific seal for something absolute, for something positive,\r\nfor something that admits of no exceptions.\r\n\r\nI have seen so much misery caused by wrong prenatal care teaching and\r\nby the foolish, exaggerated ideas on the subject, that I consider it\r\nmy duty to say something in order to counteract those erroneous\r\nnotions. I consider it my special mission to destroy error, mysticism\r\nand superstition. And the prenatal care teaching as imparted by some\r\nunfortunately partakes of all three of the above.\r\n\r\nOf course, I repeat, the mother should try to be in the best possible\r\ncondition while she is carrying the child. Nevertheless, it is foolish\r\nto imagine if the mother is not quite well, or is worried about\r\nsomething, or has a fit of anger, that it is invariably going to be\r\nreflected on the child. The child, as we know, has no nervous\r\nconnection whatever with the mother, and it is only very violent or\r\nprolonged shocks that are apt to have an injurious influence.\r\n\r\nI know of children that were carried by their mothers in anger and in\r\nanguish from the day of conception to the day of delivery. And still\r\nthey were born perfectly normal. I know of a child whose mother was\r\nsuffering the most hellish tortures of jealousy during the entire\r\nperiod of pregnancy, and still the child was born perfectly healthy,\r\nperfectly normal, and is now a splendid specimen of manhood. I know\r\nchildren whose mothers went through severe attacks of pneumonia,\r\ntyphoid fever, etc., and still they were born perfectly healthy and\r\nperfectly normal. I know children whose mothers were using every means\r\nto abort them, took all kinds of internal medicines until they were\r\ndeathly sick, and still they were born perfectly healthy and normal. I\r\nknow children whose mothers tried to abort them by mechanical means,\r\nwho went to abortionists who made one or more attempts to induce the\r\nabortion--I know even cases where the mothers bled as a result of such\r\nattempts--and nevertheless, the children were born perfectly healthy,\r\ndeveloped normally physically and mentally.\r\n\r\nOf course these are not things that I would advise women to do or to\r\nundergo. I would not advise pregnant women to worry, to be sick, to\r\ntake poisonous medicines or to make attempts at abortion, but I merely\r\nbring up these points to emphasize to my readers not to take the\r\nnecessity of prenatal care in too absolute a sense, and not to worry\r\nthemselves unnecessarily if the conditions during their pregnancy are\r\nnot all that could be desired. The child is not necessarily going to\r\nbe affected. The condition of the germ-plasms, i.e., the condition of\r\nthe ovum and the spermatozoa at the time of conception is more\r\nimportant than all subsequent care during gestation.\r\n\r\nAs there are foolish people who possess a peculiar knack of\r\nmisinterpreting and misunderstanding everything, I wish to emphasize\r\nthat hygiene during pregnancy should not be neglected. Everything\r\npossible should be done to put the mother in the best possible\r\nphysical and mental condition. All I want to say is that it is bad to\r\nbe insane on the subject, that it is bad to take things in an absolute\r\nsense, and that it is bad to exaggerate.\r\n\r\nYou will often hear it said that a child that was conceived when the\r\nfather was in an exhilarated condition is apt to be epileptic, or\r\nnervous, or insane, and what not. This is also to be taken with a\r\ngrain of salt. A chronic alcoholic has a defective germ-plasm, and his\r\nchildren are apt to be defective. But a glass of wine at a wedding\r\nbanquet cannot affect the previously formed spermatozoa. And the\r\nstatements about children being born defective or developing\r\ndefectively because their fathers took an occasional glass of wine are\r\nunworthy of serious consideration; are unworthy of any consideration.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the above the reports of some cases of _violence_\r\nand _accidents_ during pregnancy which, in spite of their severity,\r\ndid not affect the children, will prove of interest.\r\n\r\nA delicate little woman missed her periods. She was sure she couldn't\r\nbe more than two weeks over-due. And this is what she did. For five\r\nnights in succession she took hot mustard baths and she took them so\r\nhot that each time she nearly fainted and came out from them like a\r\nbroiled lobster. No effect. She then took a box of pills which cost\r\nher two dollars. No effect except causing diarrhea. She then took two\r\nboxes of capsules which upset her stomach and made her fearfully\r\nnauseous. No other effect. She then ate one-half a colocynth, which\r\nmade her terribly sick, causing a bloody diarrhea. She had to stay in\r\nbed for three or four days. She then took burning vaginal injections\r\nwith some ipecac in them. No effect except making her feel raw so that\r\nshe needed large amounts of cold cream. She then took secale cornutum\r\nand radix gossypii. No effect except giving her a headache, making her\r\nsick to her stomach and completely destroying her appetite, so that\r\nwithin a very short time she lost nearly ten pounds. She was then told\r\nthat long walks might be efficient. She took walks of six and seven\r\nmiles at a time, coming home more dead than alive. No effect. She then\r\nheard that jumping off a table is a very efficient means. She did it\r\na dozen times in succession so that she was completely fagged out and\r\nout of breath. Eight and a half months later she gave birth to a\r\nperfectly healthy, well-formed boy weighing eight pounds.\r\n\r\nThe following case was reported by Brillaud-Laujardiere. A farmer who\r\nwas responsible for the condition of a servant of his household\r\nconceived the idea of riding horseback with her in order to bring\r\nabout an abortion, and pushing her off when the horse was running at\r\ngreat speed. This he repeated several times. The woman gave birth to a\r\nperfectly normal infant at full term.\r\n\r\nHofmann reports that another farmer, under similar circumstances,\r\nbrutally kicked the woman in the abdomen repeatedly until she lost\r\nconsciousness. The pregnancy continued to full term notwithstanding.\r\nIn another case of Hofmann's, a woman allowed a heavy door to fall\r\nupon her, but the pregnancy was not affected.\r\n\r\nDr. Guibout relates that a German woman, living with her husband in\r\nCalifornia, being pregnant, wished to return to Munich, her home-town,\r\nto be delivered. The train in which she travelled through Panama\r\ncollided with another train. Threatened abortion required her to take\r\na rest. She took a steamer and after a very rough passage reached\r\nPortsmouth. From there she went to Paris. Here she fell down a flight\r\nof stairs in the hotel where she was stopping. Again she was\r\nthreatened with abortion, but after a rest was in good condition and\r\ncontinued her journey. She finally reached home, and was delivered at\r\nfull term of a normal infant.\r\n\r\nVibert reports the case of a woman who was in a train accident which\r\ninjured her severely, killed two of her children, but did not affect\r\nher pregnancy. She was delivered at the proper time of a normal baby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\r\n\r\nTHE MENOPAUSE OR CHANGE OF LIFE\r\n\r\n Time of Menopause--Cause of Suffering During Menopause--\r\n  Reproductive Function and Sexual Function Not Synonymous--\r\n  Increased Libido During Menopause--Change of Life in Men.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on menstruation I referred briefly to the menopause. I\r\nwill consider it here somewhat more in detail.\r\n\r\nThe menopause, also called the climacteric, and in common language\r\n\"change of life,\" is the period at which woman ceases to menstruate.\r\nThe average age at which this occurs is about forty-eight. But while\r\nsome women continue to menstruate up to the age of fifty, fifty-two,\r\nand even fifty-five, others cease to menstruate at the age of\r\nforty-five or even forty-two. Between forty-four and fifty-two are the\r\nnormal limits. Anything before or beyond that is exceptional.\r\n\r\nJust as the beginning of menstruation may set in without any trouble\r\nof any kind, and just as some women have not the slightest unpleasant\r\nsymptoms during the entire period of their menstrual life, so the\r\nmenopause occurs in some women without any trouble, physical or\r\npsychic. The periods between the menses become perhaps a little\r\nlonger, or a little irregular, the menstrual flow becomes more and\r\nmore scanty, then one or several periods may be skipped altogether,\r\nand the menopause is permanently established. Many women, however, the\r\nmajority probably, suffer considerably during the transitional year or\r\nyears of the menopause. Symptoms are both of a physical and of a\r\npsychic character, but the psychic symptoms predominate. There may be\r\nheadache, capricious appetite, or complete loss of appetite,\r\nconsiderable loss of flesh, or on the contrary very sudden and rapid\r\nputting on of fat, great irritability, insomnia, profuse perspiration;\r\nhot flashes throughout the body, and particularly in the face, which\r\nmake the face \"blushing\" and congested, are particularly frequent.\r\nThen the woman's character may be completely changed. From gentle and\r\nsubmissive she may become pugnacious and quarrelsome. Jealousy without\r\nany grounds for it may be one of the disagreeable symptoms, making\r\nboth the wife and the husband very unhappy. In some exceptional cases\r\na genuine neurosis or psychosis may develop.\r\n\r\n=Cause of Suffering During Menopause.= It is my conviction, and I have\r\nhad this conviction for many years, that many, if not most, of the\r\ndistressing symptoms of the menopause are due, not to the menopause\r\nitself, but to the wrong ideas about this period that have prevailed\r\nfor so many centuries. We know the influence of the mind over the\r\nbody, and the pernicious effect which wrong ideas may exercise over\r\nour feelings. The generally prevalent opinion among women, and men for\r\nthat matter, and not only of the laity but unfortunately of the\r\nmedical profession as well, is that the menopause is the end of\r\nwoman's sexual life. Every woman is laboring under the erroneous\r\nimpression that with the establishment of the menopause, with the\r\ncessation of the menses, she ceases to be a woman, and as she does not\r\nbecome a man, she becomes something of a neuter being, neither woman\r\nnor man. And she has the idea that after the menopause she can have no\r\nfurther attraction for her husband or for other men. Naturally such an\r\nidea has a very depressing effect on any human being. Any human being\r\nfights to the last to retain all its human functions, especially the\r\nfunction which is considered as important as is the sexual function.\r\n\r\n=Reproductive Function and Sexual Function Not Synonymous.= Of course\r\nwith the permanent cessation of the menses the woman's _reproductive_\r\nfunction is at an end. But the reproductive function is _not_\r\nsynonymous with the sexual function, I must insist again and again,\r\nand naturally until this erroneous idea is dispelled much unnecessary\r\nmisery will be the lot of our women. If women in general will learn\r\nthat with the establishment of the menopause they do _not_ cease to be\r\nwomen, if they will learn that the sexual desire in women lasts long\r\nbeyond the cessation of the menopause, many women being as passionate\r\nat sixty as at thirty, if they will learn that their attractiveness or\r\nnon-attractiveness to the male sex does not depend upon the menopause,\r\nbut upon their general condition, if they will learn that many women\r\nat fifty and sixty are much more attractive than some women at half\r\nthat age, they will not take the onset of the menopause so tragically\r\nand they will thereby avoid the greater part of their mental and\r\nemotional suffering.\r\n\r\nThe actual atrophy of the ovaries, uterus, external genitals and the\r\nbreasts can, of course, not be prevented, but that atrophy is a slow\r\nand gradual process, and is not in itself the cause of the various\r\ndistressing symptoms that we have enumerated.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the menopause, if the symptoms are at all\r\ndisagreeable, or distressing, should be in the hands of a competent\r\nphysician. A little wholesome advice may be more efficient than\r\ngallons of medicine and bushels of pills. In general the woman should\r\ntry to lead as calm and peaceful a life as possible. Warm baths daily\r\nare beneficial, constipation should be guarded against, hot vaginal\r\ndouches are often efficient against the disagreeable flushes, and\r\nlast, but not least, the husband should during this critical period be\r\ndoubly kind and doubly considerate of his wife. It is during the years\r\nbetween forty-five and fifty-five that the wife is most in need of her\r\nhusband's sympathy and support.\r\n\r\n=Increased Libido During Menopause.= There is one rather delicate\r\nsymptom which I must not pass unmentioned. Some women during the years\r\nwhile the menopause is being established, and for some years after the\r\nmenopause, experience a greatly heightened sexual desire. In some\r\ncases this increased libido is normal, that is, no other pathologic\r\nsymptoms or local conditions can be discovered. In some cases the\r\nincreased libido is distinctly due to local congestion, congestion of\r\nthe ovaries, the uterus, etc. In some cases, I can distinctly testify,\r\nit is psychic or autosuggestive. Because the woman thinks, and\r\nbelieves that other people think, that she is soon going to lose all\r\nher sexuality, she unconsciously works herself up into a sexual\r\npassion which sometimes may be of long duration and may even lead to\r\ndisastrous results.\r\n\r\nWhat to do in such cases? Where the woman's libido is normal or near\r\nnormal, then naturally it should be normally gratified. But if the\r\nlibido seems to be abnormally strong and the demands for sexual\r\ngratification are too frequent, then the woman should be treated and\r\nsexual gratification should not be indulged in, because in such cases,\r\nas a rule, sexual gratification only adds fuel to the fire, and the\r\nwoman's demands may become more and more frequent, more and more\r\ninsistent. In exceptional cases it may even reach the intensity of\r\nnymphomania. In such cases the aid of a tactful physician is\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\nChange of Life in Men\r\n\r\nTo people not familiar with the subject it sounds rather strange to\r\nspeak of \"change of life\" in men.\r\n\r\nMan, possessing no menstrual function, cannot have any menopause, but\r\nstill sexologists and psychologists who have studied the subject\r\ncarefully are convinced that between the ages of forty-five and\r\nfifty-five men also undergo a certain change which may be spoken of as\r\nthe change of life or the male climacteric.\r\n\r\nThey become irritable, capricious, very susceptible to feminine\r\ncharms, are apt to fall in love, and in many the sexual instinct is\r\ngreatly increased. As in women, this increase of the sexual desire is\r\nsometimes due to pathologic causes, such as an inflamed prostate\r\ngland--in other cases it is of psychic origin.\r\n\r\nJust as a man should be particularly kind and considerate to his wife\r\nduring her menopause, so the wife, understanding that her husband is\r\ngoing through a critical period, will also increase her tact, patience\r\nand consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\r\n\r\nTHE HABIT OF MASTURBATION\r\n\r\n Definition of Masturbation--Its Injurious Effects in Girls as\r\n  Compared with Boys--Married Life of the Girl Masturbator--\r\n  Necessity for Change in Injurious Attitude of Parents who Discover\r\n  the Habit--Common-sense Treatment of the Habit--How to Prevent\r\n  Formation of Habit--Parents' Advice to Children--Hot Baths as\r\n  Factor in Masturbation--Other Physical Factors--Mental\r\n  Masturbation and Its Effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nMasturbation or self-abuse is a term applied to a bad habit which\r\nconsists in handling and rubbing the genitals. It is a bad habit\r\nbecause it is apt to injure the health and future development of the\r\ngirl. The more frequently it is practiced, the more injurious it is.\r\nIt is more injurious than when practiced by boys, because the effects\r\nare usually more permanent. Girls who indulge in the habit of\r\nmasturbation to excess not only weaken themselves, become anemic and\r\nget a dingy, pimply complexion, but they lose their desire for normal\r\nsexual relations when they grow up, and are unable to derive any\r\npleasure from the sexual act when they get married. In fact, many\r\ngirls who masturbated excessively get a strong aversion to the normal\r\nsexual act, and their married life is an unhappy one. Their husbands\r\noften have to ask for a divorce. Fortunately, the habit is much less\r\nwidespread among girls than it is among boys. While about ninety per\r\ncent. of all boys--nine out of every ten--masturbate more or less,\r\nonly about ten or at most twenty per cent. of girls are addicted to\r\nthis habit. But whatever the percentage may be, the habit is an\r\ninjurious one, and if you value your health, your beauty and proper\r\ngrowth and mental development, you should not indulge in it. If you\r\nare already indulging, if you are used to handling your genitals, if a\r\nbad companion has initiated you into the habit, you should give it up.\r\nAnd mothers should watch their children, guard them against developing\r\nthe habit, and do everything possible to cure them of it, if\r\nprevention comes too late.\r\n\r\nBut while as you see I do not deny the evil effects of masturbation,\r\nit is necessary to state that a great change has taken place in our\r\nopinions on the subject, and it is but right that parents should know\r\nof this change of opinion among the medical profession, particularly\r\namong those who specialize in sexology.\r\n\r\n=Wrong Behavior of Parents.= When parents make the \"awful\" discovery\r\nthat their child is fondling its genitals or is indulging in\r\nmasturbation, they feel as if a great calamity had befallen them.\r\nThey could not feel worse if they learned that the child was a thief\r\nor a pyromaniac. Imbued with the medieval idea of the \"sinfulness\" of\r\nthe habit, as well as its injuriousness, they begin to scold the\r\nchild, to frighten it, to make it believe that it is doing something\r\nterrible, that it has disgraced them and itself; and they try to\r\npersuade it that, unless it stops immediately, the most direful\r\nconsequences are awaiting it. The results of this mode of procedure\r\nare disastrous--much more so than is the masturbation itself.\r\n\r\nOften the scolding and the exposure of the child are done in the\r\npresence of others. This implants in the poor girl a sullen resentment\r\nthat only makes it more difficult for it to break the habit. When the\r\nchild is brought to the physician, you can see by its behavior, by its\r\ndowncast looks, by its sulkiness, by its attempt to refrain from\r\ntears, and other signs, that it regards the physician in exactly the\r\nsame light as a youthful criminal regards the judge before whom he has\r\nbeen brought for trial.\r\n\r\nIt is time, high time, that this silly and injurious attitude toward a\r\npractice, which is very common, be radically changed. It is time that\r\nparents and physicians learn that the injuriousness of the habit has\r\nbeen greatly, grossly exaggerated. It is time that they know that the\r\nvast majority of boys and girls get over the habit without being much,\r\nor any, the worse for it. The knowledge of this fact will not only\r\nsave them and the children much needless anguish and suffering, but\r\nwill make it much easier to deal with the latter, make it much easier\r\nto get them divorced from the habit.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the matter in a sensible, common-sense way, and do not\r\ntell the child caught in the practice that it has done something\r\ndisgracefully vicious and criminal, but speak to it kindly and tell it\r\nthat it is doing something that may injure it greatly, that may\r\ninterfere with its future mental and physical health and development,\r\nthen we shall have far greater success in our endeavors to break the\r\nboy or the girl of the habit of masturbation. As I have said in\r\nanother place:\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion, stigmatizing even the most moderate indulgence in\r\nmasturbation as a vice has a deleterious effect upon the people who so\r\nindulge and makes it harder for them to break off the habit. Every\r\nthinking physician and sexologist can tell you that picturing the\r\nmasturbatory habit in too lurid colors and stigmatizing it with too\r\nstrong epithets has, as a rule, the contrary effect to the one\r\nexpected. The victims of the habit consider themselves degraded,\r\nirretrievably lost. They lose their self-respect, and it is, on\r\naccount of that, harder for them to break themselves of the habit.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall accomplish a good deal more with our youthful and older\r\npatients if we leave alone, altogether, the moral side of the\r\nquestion--if there be any moral side to it--and emphasize the physical\r\ninjuriousness of the habit. We do not want to diminish the\r\nself-respect of our boys and girls, we want to increase it; and we can\r\nnot do this if we make them believe that a masturbator is a vicious\r\ncriminal. Inspire your patients with confidence, tell them that\r\nindulgence in the habit jeopardizes their future growth, both physical\r\nand mental, their health and happiness, and you will find them easier\r\nto control.\r\n\r\nI am not trying to minimize the danger of masturbation, for, if\r\nindulged in from an early age and to great excess, the results _may_\r\nbe disastrous. But, even if I were to minimize the evil consequences,\r\nthat would be less of a sin than to exaggerate them the way it has\r\nbeen done for so many years, by so many people in the profession and\r\nout of it. The evil results of exaggerating the influence of\r\nmasturbation have been so great in the past that, if now the pendulum\r\nwere to swing to the other extreme, I am sure it would not be a bad\r\nthing at all.\r\n\r\nTo deal with the subject of the _treatment_ of masturbation belongs to\r\na medical treatise. But, a few remarks on how to prevent children from\r\nacquiring the habit of masturbation will not be out of place.\r\n\r\n=Prevention of the Habit of Masturbation.= The keynote of preventing\r\nthe habit is, carefully to watch the child from its earliest infancy.\r\nWe know that not infrequently stupid or vicious nursemaids,\r\nwet-nurses, and even governesses ignorantly or deliberately induce the\r\nhabit in children under their charge. This, of course, must be\r\nprevented. Even children of the age of nine, ten, eleven years should\r\nnot be left alone, but always be under supervision. Too close\r\nfriendship between boys or girls, particularly of different ages,\r\nshould be looked upon with suspicion.\r\n\r\nA number of girls never should sleep in the same room without\r\nsupervision by an older person.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping together of two in the same bed, whether it be two\r\nchildren or a grown person and a child, should not be permitted under\r\nany circumstances. I admit of no exceptions to this demand. It makes\r\nno difference whether the other person is a mother, a father, a\r\nbrother or a sister. Leaving out of the question any _deliberate_\r\nelement, the thing is dangerous; for, very often, unintentionally,\r\nunwittingly, masturbation is initiated by this intimate contact.\r\n\r\nThe child--boy or girl--should sleep alone, on a rather hard mattress.\r\nThe covering should be light. A coverlet may be put over the feet. The\r\nchild always should sleep with the arms out upon the cover or blanket,\r\nnever _under_ the same. If this is done from childhood on, it is very\r\neasy to get used to this way of sleeping, and many a case of\r\nmasturbation will thus be obviated. The child should not be permitted\r\nto loll in bed: it must be taught to get up as soon as it awakes in\r\nthe morning. The general bringing-up must be of a strengthening,\r\nhardening character; and this applies both to the body and the will.\r\nWhen the children reach the age of nine, ten, eleven, twelve or\r\nthirteen years (we must use discrimination and judgment, for, some\r\nchildren of nine are as developed as are others of thirteen), we must\r\ntell them that it is bad and injurious to handle one's genitals, and\r\nwe must warn them to shun any companions who wish to initiate them\r\ninto any manipulations of these parts or who show an inclination to\r\ntalk about the sexual organs and sex matters.\r\n\r\nHot baths are very injurious for young children in their influence in\r\nthis direction. There is no question that a hot bath has a very\r\ndecided stimulating effect upon the sexual desire of adults as well as\r\nof children, both male and female; in fact, I have had several\r\npatients of either sex tell me that their first masturbatory act was\r\ncommitted while they were in a hot bath. Of course, the sensation\r\nhaving been pleasurable, they kept on repeating the experience.\r\n\r\nEvery factor liable to give rise to the habit should be removed. Thus,\r\nfor instance, eczema about the genitals, strongly acid urine,\r\nseatworms, and the like, should be treated until cured. That anything\r\nhaving a tendency prematurely to awaken the sexual instinct should be\r\nrigorously avoided, goes without saying.\r\n\r\n=Mental or Psychic Masturbation.= Some girls and women will abstain\r\nfrom handling themselves with their hands (manual masturbation), but\r\nwill practice what we call mental masturbation. That is, they will\r\nconcentrate their minds on the opposite sex, will picture to\r\nthemselves various lascivious scenes, until they feel \"satisfied.\"\r\nThis method is extremely injurious and exhausting and is very likely\r\nto lead to neurasthenia and a nervous breakdown. You should break\r\nyourself of it, by all means, if you can. For it is even more\r\ninjurious than the regular habit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY\r\n\r\nLEUCORRHEA--THE WHITES\r\n\r\n Misconception Regarding the Meaning of the Term \"Leucorrhea\"--A\r\n  Common Complaint--Severe Cases--Reasons for Resistance to\r\n  Treatment--Proper Local Treatment of the Disorder--Sterility Due\r\n  to Leucorrhea--Causes of Leucorrhea--Tonic Medicines--Local\r\n  Treatment--Formulae for Douching.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeucorrhea means literally a \"white running,\" and is applied by the\r\nlaity to any whitish discharge coming from the vagina. This is wrong,\r\nbecause some white discharges may be of little importance; others may\r\nbe of a serious character, and not be leucorrhea at all.\r\n\r\nLeucorrhea is one of the banes of the modern girl and woman. It is\r\nvery frequent. Probably at least twenty-five per cent, (some say fifty\r\nor seventy-five per cent.) of all women suffer with it in a greater or\r\nlesser degree. In some cases it is only an annoyance, necessitating\r\nthe frequent changing of napkins, but in others it causes a great deal\r\nof weakness, backache, erosions, itching and burning. It is very\r\nresistant to treatment, particularly in girls. The reason it is so\r\nresistant to treatment is because the discharge, while coming from\r\nthe vagina, _does not usually originate_ in the vagina; it originates\r\nin the neck of the womb, and the hundreds and hundreds of injections\r\nthat women take for their leucorrhea only reach the vagina; they\r\ncannot penetrate into the womb. And it is only by treating the cavity\r\nof the cervix, which can only be done by a physician, through a\r\nspeculum, that the root of the trouble can be reached. And, if any\r\nerosion or ulcer is noticed, it can be directly touched up with the\r\nnecessary application. And it is for this reason that in girls\r\nleucorrhea is so much more difficult to treat. For fear of having the\r\nhymen ruptured the girl objects to a thorough examination and to local\r\ntreatment, and the leucorrhea is permitted to proceed until perhaps a\r\nchronic inflammation of the womb and the Fallopian tubes is\r\nestablished. There is no doubt that many cases of sterility or\r\nchildlessness in women are due to long-neglected leucorrhea in\r\ngirlhood.\r\n\r\n=What Is the Cause of Leucorrhea?= We can answer simply: the cause of\r\nleucorrhea is catarrh in any part of the female genital tract. But\r\nthis is no real answer. What are the causes of the catarrh? The causes\r\nof catarrh are many: the most common cause is a cold. Wetting the feet\r\nand getting chilled, particularly during the menses, may set up a\r\ncatarrh in the cervix. Long standing on one's feet, lifting and\r\ncarrying heavy bundles, dancing in overheated rooms and then going out\r\nscantily clad in the chill night air, prolonged ungratified sexual\r\nexcitement, lack of cleanliness in the external genitals--all these\r\nare factors in setting up a catarrh of the cervix with a resultant\r\nleucorrhea. A general rundown condition, worry, overwork, too hard\r\nstudy, lack of fresh air, and a general scrofulous condition also\r\nfavor the development of catarrh of the womb and leucorrhea. It will\r\ntherefore be seen that the treatment of leucorrhea to be successful\r\nmust be general and local.\r\n\r\n=General Treatment.= The general treatment consists in general\r\nhygienic measures and in common sense. The patient should not be on\r\nher feet more than she can help, and she should not walk until\r\nexhausted or fatigued. It is better to take several short walks than\r\none long one. The corset she wears, if she wears any at all, should be\r\nof the modern kind: not one that presses the womb and the other\r\nabdominal organs down, but one that supports the abdominal walls, and\r\nrather raises the abdominal organs up. The lacing or buttoning must be\r\nfrom below up, and not from above down. That it should not in any way\r\ninterfere with the freedom of respiration goes without saying.\r\nConstipation if any, to be treated, must be treated intelligently, by\r\nmild measures (see Constipation, in the chapter on pregnancy), and\r\ncare must be taken that the bowels move at regular hours. Where the\r\nleucorrhea is due to or is aggravated by anemia and general weakness,\r\na good iron preparation, such as one Blaud's five-grain pill three\r\ntimes a day, or a tonic of iron, quinine and strychnine, will do good.\r\nA daily cold bath or cold sponge, followed by a brisk dry rubbing with\r\na rough towel, is also useful.\r\n\r\n=Local Treatment.= Local measures consist of painting or swabbing the\r\nvagina and cervix with various solutions, of tampons, suppositories\r\nand douches. Local application to the vagina and uterus can be done\r\nsatisfactorily by the physician or nurse only. The insertion of a\r\nsuppository or douching can be easily done by the patient herself.\r\n\r\nWhile it is always best and safest to consult a physician, and, while\r\nself-medication is generally inadvisable, there are occasions when a\r\nphysician is not available; in some small places a woman may, _for\r\nvarious reasons_, have a strong objection to gynecological examination\r\nand treatment; and some women may be too poor to pay the doctor. In\r\nsuch circumstances self-treatment is justified and there can be no\r\nobjection to it if the remedies are harmless and are sure to do some\r\ngood; that is, to improve the condition where they do not effect a\r\ncomplete cure.\r\n\r\nOne of the simplest things is an alum tampon. You take a piece of\r\nabsorbent cotton, about the size of a fist, spread it out, put about a\r\ntablespoonful of powdered alum on it, fold it up, tie a string around\r\nthe center, insert it in the vagina as far as it will go, and leave it\r\nin for twenty-four hours. Then pull it gently by the string and\r\nsyringe yourself with a quart or two quarts of warm water. Such a\r\ntampon may be inserted every other day or every third day, and I have\r\nknown many cases where this simple treatment alone produced a cure. In\r\nsome cases, however, douches work better and the two best things for\r\ndouching are: tincture of iodine and lactic acid. Buy, say, four\r\nounces of tincture of iodine, and use two teaspoonfuls in two quarts\r\nof hot water in a douche bag. This injection should be used twice a\r\nday, morning and night. Of the lactic acid you buy, say, a pint, and\r\nuse two tablespoonfuls to two quarts of water. The lactic acid has the\r\nadvantage over the tincture of iodine that it is colorless, while the\r\niodine is dark and stains whatever it comes in contact with. Sometimes\r\nI order the use of the tincture of iodine and the lactic acid\r\nalternately: for one douche the tincture of iodine, for the next the\r\nlactic acid, and so on. When the condition improves, it is sufficient\r\nto use one teaspoonful of the tincture of iodine and one tablespoonful\r\nof the lactic acid to two quarts of water. These injections are quite\r\nefficient and have the advantage of being perfectly harmless. One\r\npoint about the injections: they should be taken not in the standing\r\nor squatting position (in which position the fluid comes right out),\r\nbut while lying down, over a douche pan. The douche bag should be only\r\nabout a foot above the bed, so that the irrigating fluid may come out\r\nslowly; the patient, after each injection taken in the daytime, should\r\nremain at least half an hour in bed (in the night time she stays all\r\nnight in bed). This gives the injection a better chance to come in\r\ncontact with all the parts of the vagina, and a portion of it comes in\r\ncontact with the cervix, where it exerts a healing effect. Avoid the\r\nuse of patent medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\r\n\r\nTHE VENEREAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n Derivation of Word \"Venereal\"--Three Venereal Diseases--Innocent\r\n  Contraction of Syphilis Through Various Objects--The Hygienic\r\n  Elimination of Common Sources of Venereal Infection--Measures for\r\n  Prevention After Sexual Relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word \"venereal\" means pertaining to sexual intercourse: venereal\r\nexcess--excess in sexual intercourse; venereal disease--a disease\r\nacquired from sexual intercourse with an infected person. The word is\r\nderived from Venus (genitive--veneris), the Roman goddess of spring,\r\nflowers and Love.\r\n\r\nThere are three venereal diseases: gonorrhea, syphilis and chancroid.\r\nOf these, gonorrhea is the most widespread, syphilis the most serious.\r\nChancroid is of comparatively little importance.\r\n\r\nWhile by far the greatest amount of venereal diseases--probably ninety\r\nper cent, of the total--is contracted from illicit[7] intercourse, it\r\nis well to bear in mind that some of it is contracted innocently,\r\neither from a kiss, or from using a sponge or a towel which has been\r\nused by an infected person, etc. While the gonorrheal germ is\r\ngenerally transmitted directly, the syphilitic poison may be\r\ntransmitted through various objects. Syphilis contracted not during\r\nintercourse, but in an innocent manner, from a kiss, a towel, a\r\ntoothbrush, a razor, etc., is called syphilis of the innocent, or\r\nsyphilis insontium. In former years doctors would not very rarely\r\ncontract syphilis from examining syphilitic women with their bare\r\nfingers. Now since gloves have come into use for examining purposes,\r\nthe number of infections has considerably diminished. And no doubt\r\nthat as the people become more familiar with the danger of venereal\r\ninfection from non-venereal sources, the number of innocent infections\r\nwill greatly diminish. The dangerous roller towel and the no less\r\ndangerous common drinking cup are being gradually eliminated as\r\nfactors of _non-venereal_ infection; and we may confidently expect\r\nthat in a decade or two the amount of venereal disease from _venereal_\r\ninfection will be greatly lessened in all civilized countries. The\r\ngeneral increase in cleanliness in all strata of society and the\r\nuniversal use of antiseptics after suspicious sexual relations will\r\nconstitute the chief factors in this diminution of venereal disease.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Illicit--illegal, non-permissible, outside of marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\r\n\r\nTHE EXTENT OF VENEREAL DISEASE\r\n\r\n Former Ban on Discussion of Venereal Disease and Its Evil\r\n  Results--Present Reprehensible Exaggerations of Extent of\r\n  Venereal Disease--Erroneous and Ridiculous Statements of\r\n  \"Reformers\"--Senseless Fear of Marriage in Girls Due to Lurid\r\n  Exaggerations--Study by Woman Psychologist Reveals Harmful\r\n  Results of Exaggerated Statements--Truth in Regard to Percentage\r\n  of Men Afflicted with Venereal Disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Former Silence.= Only a very few years ago respectable women, by\r\nwhich I mean all women outside of the women called \"fallen,\" did not\r\nknow of the existence of venereal disease. It was considered a\r\nprohibited, disgraceful subject, not to be mentioned or even hinted at\r\nin conversation, in books or magazines, in lectures, or on the stage.\r\nWhen I say that they did not know of the _existence_ of such a thing\r\nas venereal disease, that the very words gonorrhea and syphilis were\r\nunknown to them, I use these expressions not as figures of speech, but\r\nin their literal meaning. All avenues of acquiring such knowledge\r\nbeing closed to them--lay people don't usually now and they surely\r\ndidn't then purchase and read strictly medical works--where could they\r\nobtain the information? The result was that when a woman was so\r\nunfortunate as to contract a venereal disease from her husband, she\r\ndid not understand its character and did not suspect its source. Which\r\nwas a rather good thing--for the husband. Family peace was more\r\nsecure.\r\n\r\n=Present Exaggerations.= Now a change has taken place in this respect,\r\nand, as is often the case with recent changes, the pendulum has swung\r\nto the other extreme. The silence of former days has given place to\r\nshouting from the housetops. The last phrase is also used almost in\r\nits literal sense. Many men and women, deeply stirred by the venereal\r\nperil, and sincerely anxious to guard boys and girls from venereal\r\ninfection, have been indulging in very reprehensible exaggerations.\r\nParticularly lurid have been the exaggerations as to the prevalence of\r\nthe disease in the male sex, with its consequent disastrous effects on\r\nmarried women. A statement made by a Dr. Noeggerath (a German\r\nphysician who practiced at the time in New York), nearly half a\r\ncentury ago, to the effect that 80 per cent, of all men have gonorrhea\r\nand that 90 per cent. of these remain uncured and infect or are apt to\r\ninfect their wives, has been shown to be a ridiculously absurd\r\nexaggeration. If it had been true, the race would now be at the point\r\nof dying out. Nevertheless, this statement is copied from book to\r\nbook, as if it were gospel truth, as if it were a scientifically and\r\nstatistically established fact instead of a wild, sensational guess.\r\nAn esteemed New York physician, Dr. Prince A. Morrow, did excellent\r\npioneer work in calling attention to the dangers of venereal disease.\r\nBut, as is the case with so many \"reformers,\" he permitted his zeal to\r\nrun away with him occasionally, and he made statements which caused\r\nand are still causing the judicious to grieve. The statement, for\r\ninstance, that there is more venereal disease among innocent, virtuous\r\nwives than among prostitutes is one to cause the real honest\r\ninvestigator to weep (over the human tendency to exaggeration), or to\r\nburst out in uproarious laughter. The ridiculousness of this statement\r\nbecomes especially evident when we recollect that the same gentleman\r\nmade the statement that every prostitute, without exception, was\r\ndiseased at one time or another. If venereal disease exists among\r\nprostitutes to the extent of 100 per cent., then how can it exist to a\r\ngreater extent among innocent, virtuous wives? And to still further\r\nemphasize the absurdity of the above statement, I will tell you that\r\nthe extent of venereal disease among married women is believed by\r\ncareful non-sensational venereologists not to exceed five per cent.!\r\n\r\nYes, the silence of former years has given place to the lurid\r\nexaggeration of the present day. While on the whole the former was\r\nworse than the latter, the latter is bad enough, because it makes many\r\ngirls unhappy, sowing in them the seeds of suspicion and cynicism,\r\ntends to make them antagonistic to the entire male sex, and inoculates\r\nthem with a senseless fear of marriage. A study made by Miriam C.\r\nGould, of the department of psychology and philosophy in the\r\nUniversity of Pittsburg (_Social Hygiene_, April, 1916), corroborates\r\nour remarks in a striking manner.\r\n\r\nShe has had confidential chats with 50 young girls, with whom she has\r\nhad some acquaintance; of these 50, 25 were college students and 25\r\nwere not. She asked them a number of questions, the purpose of which\r\nwas to find out what psychologic effect, if any, their knowledge of\r\nprostitution and of venereal disease has had on them. She states in\r\nher conclusions that \"the histories reveal a large percentage of\r\nharmful results, such as conditions bordering upon neurasthenia,\r\nmelancholia, pessimism and _sex antagonism_ (italics mine), directly\r\ntraceable to this knowledge. Eleven of the girls interviewed developed\r\na pronounced repulsion for men, although prior to their 'knowledge'\r\nthey had enjoyed men's company. They now avoid association with them,\r\nand six have declared that they have totally lost faith in the moral\r\ncleanness of men. Eight have already refused to marry, or intend to do\r\nso, because of their belief that the risk of infection was too great.\r\nIf it were not for the existence of these diseases, they say they\r\nwould be glad to marry. All of these say their decision has rendered\r\nthem more or less unhappy.\"\r\n\r\nIn the laudable desire to keep our young women pure and to protect\r\nthem from infection, in the endeavor to make them demand one moral\r\nstandard for both sexes, our exaggerating reformers are condemning\r\nthem to lifelong celibacy, which in the case of women often means\r\nlifelong neurasthenia and hypochondria.\r\n\r\n=The Truth of the Matter.= Here is the Truth about venereal\r\ndisease--the truth as I know it, without concealment on the one hand\r\nand without exaggeration on the other. Exact figures are, of course,\r\nunobtainable anywhere; but results obtained from unbiased\r\ninvestigations of _different_ classes of society, from hospital\r\nreports, from questionnaires among students, etc., tell us that\r\nprobably about twenty per cent. of the adult male population are the\r\nvictims of gonorrhea at one time or another; that probably eight or\r\nten per cent. are not entirely cured when they enter matrimony; and\r\nfour or five per cent. (some would say two per cent.) of wives become\r\ninfected with gonorrhea. This, I say, is terrible enough, and makes\r\nthe greatest care and caution imperative; for, if you should be one of\r\nthe victims of the two or five per cent., it would be little\r\nconsolation to you that the other ninety-eight or ninety-five per\r\ncent. of wives have escaped.\r\n\r\nOf course the percentage of venereal disease among young men, and\r\nafterwards among their wives, will vary greatly with the stratum of\r\nsociety. Among the \"lower\" strata you may find fifty per cent. of\r\ninfection, with a very large percentage of those uncured. Not because\r\nthey are of a lower morality than the higher classes, but because the\r\ncheap class of prostitutes that they are obliged to patronize are\r\nfrequently diseased and because they cannot afford expert treatment,\r\nor any treatment at all. Among these classes you will naturally find a\r\nmuch larger percentage of diseased wives. But then to counteract this\r\nwe must bear in mind that there are large classes of men in whom\r\ngonorrhea exists only to the extent of five or ten per cent., and we\r\nhave large classes of wives among whom the victims of gonorrhea will\r\ncome up only to a fraction of one per cent.\r\n\r\nThe above figures, you see, differ materially from the statements\r\nfound in so many sex books that \"80 per cent. of all married men in\r\nNew York have gonorrhea,\" and that \"at least three out of every five\r\n[60 per cent.!] married women in New York have gonorrhea.\" Whenever\r\nyou read or hear such a statement treat it with a smile--or with\r\ncontempt, as all false statements should be treated.\r\n\r\nAs to syphilis, the extent of the prevalence may be given as between\r\ntwo and five per cent. Which percentage differs considerable from the\r\n75, 50 or 25 per cent. given us by some sex lecturers, but which is\r\nterrible enough as it is, without any exaggerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\r\n\r\nGONORRHEA\r\n\r\n Source of Gonorrhea--Mucous Membrane of Genital Organs and of Eye\r\n  Principal Seats of Disease--Symptoms in Men and in Women--Vagina\r\n  Seldom Attacked in Adults--Nobody Inherits Gonorrhea--Ophthalmia\r\n  Neonatorum--Differences of Course of Disease in Men and Women--\r\n  Gonorrhea Less Painful in Women--Symptoms not Suspected by Woman--\r\n  Necessity for the Woman Consulting a Physician--Self-treatment\r\n  When Woman Cannot Consult Physician--Formulae for Injections.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of gonorrhea and syphilis is treated pretty fully, from a\r\nlayman's point of view, in the author's _Sex Knowledge for Men_. I do\r\nnot intend to devote much space to a discussion of the details of\r\nthese two diseases here, because the subject is not of such direct\r\ninterest to women. Respectable girls and women do not indulge in\r\nillicit relations the same as respectable men and boys do, and their\r\ndanger of contracting a venereal disease is insignificant as compared\r\nwith men's liability. I will, therefore, touch upon only a few points,\r\nparticularly insofar as the diseases differ in their course from the\r\ncourse pursued in men. Those, however, who are interested may read the\r\nchapters on the subject in the author's _Sex Knowledge for Men_, and\r\nif they want still fuller details, they may study the author's\r\n_Treatment of Gonorrhea and Its Complications in Men and Women_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GONORRHEAL GERMS.]\r\n\r\n=Gonorrhea= is an inflammation caused by a germ called the gonococcus,\r\ndiscovered by Dr. A. Neisser, of Breslau, Germany, in 1879. Any mucous\r\nmembrane may be the seat of gonorrhea, but it attacks by preference\r\nthe mucous membrane of the genital organs, and of one other organ--the\r\neye. Its principal symptoms are: inflammation, pain, burning and\r\ndischarge. In men, it attacks the urethra; in women it attacks the\r\ncervix--the neck of the womb--the urethra, and the vulva. The vagina\r\nis seldom attacked in adult women, because the mucous membrane of the\r\nadult vagina is rather tough and does not offer a good soil for the\r\ndevelopment of the gonococcus germ. The discharge that a woman has\r\nwhen she has gonorrhea comes principally or exclusively from the neck\r\nof the womb. In little girls, however, in whom the lining of the\r\nvagina is tender, gonorrhea of the vagina and the vulva is common.\r\n(See chapter Vulvovaginitis in Little Girls.) Gonorrhea is a local\r\ndisease. While in some cases, after the disease has lasted for some\r\ntime, a certain poison is generated by the germs which circulates in\r\nthe blood, and while the germs may occasionally wander into distant\r\norgans, still in 98 per cent. of all cases gonorrhea is a local\r\ndisease, and if taken in time is cured without leaving any traces on\r\nthe general organism.\r\n\r\n=Gonorrhea Not Hereditary.= Then, gonorrhea is not a hereditary\r\ndisease. Nobody ever _inherits_ gonorrhea. A child may be born with a\r\ngonorrheal inflammation of the eyes (ophthalmia neonatorum), but this\r\ninflammation is not inherited; it can only be acquired if the mother\r\nis suffering with gonorrhea while the child is being born: some of the\r\npus in the mother's birth canal gets into the child's eyes while it\r\npasses through the uterus and vagina. This is not heredity; this is\r\nsimple infection, and can be avoided by keeping the mother's birth\r\ncanal clean by antiseptic douches before childbirth. In short, I\r\nrepeat gonorrhea is essentially a local and not a constitutional\r\ndisease, and is not hereditary. In which two respects it differs from\r\nsyphilis, which is the most constitutional and most hereditary of all\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n=Course of Gonorrhea in Men and Women.= Gonorrhea runs an entirely\r\ndifferent course in women than it does in men. When a man has\r\ngonorrhea he knows it immediately; first, because the discharge tells\r\nhim that there is something the matter with him, for a man is not used\r\nto having any discharge from the urethra unless there is something the\r\nmatter with him. Second, the urine becomes at once burning and\r\npainful. In women the urethra is a separate canal from the vagina, and\r\nthe urethra is very frequently not affected in gonorrhea. The\r\ninfection generally starts in the cervix, and the disease may last for\r\nconsiderable time before the woman becomes aware of it. In general,\r\ngonorrhea is a less painful disease in woman, and this is a bad thing,\r\nbecause she thus neglects treatment and loses valuable time,\r\npermitting the disease to develop. Even when the urethra is affected\r\nin women, it does not give as severe symptoms as inflammation of the\r\nurethra in men. If the woman does have pains she often pays no\r\nattention to them, because woman is used to pains; as we have seen\r\nbefore, fifty per cent. of all women suffer more or less with\r\ndysmenorrhea. Many of them have a leucorrheal discharge of greater or\r\nlesser degree, and therefore if there is an increase in the pains, or\r\nan increase in the discharge, little attention is paid to the matter.\r\nIn fact, a woman may have a chronic gonorrhea for months or years\r\nwithout being aware that there is anything the matter with her. It is\r\nimportant to teach women to seek medical aid as soon as they notice\r\nany increase in the amount of the discharge, or change in color,\r\nparticularly if it becomes greenish, or if the odor becomes offensive,\r\nor if there is chafing, burning, or irritation around the genitals,\r\nand particularly if there is an increase in the frequency or urgency\r\nof urination, or if there is a burning, scalding, or cutting sensation\r\nduring the act of urination. Also whenever the sexual act becomes\r\npainful. If women consulted a physician as soon as they noticed any of\r\nthe symptoms referred to above, they would save months and years of\r\nsuffering and expense, because the disease would often be taken in\r\nhand while still limited to the cervix, and not, as is now often the\r\ncase, after the inflammation has extended into the uterus and\r\nFallopian tubes.\r\n\r\n=Self-treatment.= I do not believe in self-treatment because it is\r\ngenerally unsatisfactory and may often even become dangerous, and I\r\ndecidedly advise every woman who suspects that she has contracted\r\ngonorrhea to apply at once to a competent physician. But it happens\r\nnot infrequently that a woman is so situated that she cannot consult a\r\nphysician. And in the meantime there is danger of the gonorrhea\r\nspreading further and further. In such cases it is advisable for the\r\nwoman to use an injection until such time when she can consult a\r\nphysician. The injection I am going to advise may in itself produce a\r\ncure; and, if it does not produce a complete cure, it at any rate\r\nimproves the condition, prevents the extension of the disease, makes\r\nsubsequent treatment easier, and besides is perfectly harmless. The\r\nbest injection for self use in gonorrhea is tincture of iodine; the\r\nproportion is two teaspoonfuls to a quart or two quarts of water. If\r\nthe case is very bad, such an injection may be taken twice a day. If\r\nthe case is not very bad, once a day is sufficient. After using the\r\ntincture of iodine for five days to a week, it is good to change off\r\nto lactic acid. Buy a pint or so of lactic acid in a drug store, and\r\nuse one tablespoonful to a quart of water. It is preferable to have\r\nthe water hot, about 100 deg., but where this is inconvenient it may\r\nbe used lukewarm. The lactic acid injection is used for three days,\r\nthen the iodine injection is resumed, then again the lactic acid, and\r\nso on. I know of many cases that were cured by this treatment alone.\r\nAnd I might mention that these injections are generally also very\r\nefficient in leucorrhea, as stated in the chapter on Leucorrhea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\r\n\r\nVULVOVAGINITIS IN LITTLE GIRLS\r\n\r\n Former Causes of Vulvovaginitis in Little Girls--Discharge Chief\r\n  Symptom--Evil Results of Vulvovaginitis--Psychic Results of\r\n  Treatment--Effects in Hastening Sexual Maturity--Vulvovaginitis a\r\n  Cause of Permanent Sterility--Measures to Prevent the\r\n  Disease--Toilet Seats and Vulvovaginitis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane, or the lining of the vulva and vagina, in little\r\ngirls is very tender, and therefore very readily subject to infection.\r\nAn infection of the vulva and vagina due to the gonococcus or to some\r\nother germ is very common in little girls. At least it used to be,\r\nparticularly among children of the poor, in institutions and\r\nhospitals. The very dangerous infective character of vulvovaginitis\r\nwas not known, and the infection was therefore easily transferred by\r\ntowels, linen, toilet seats, bedpans, syringe nozzles, thermometers,\r\nthe nurses' hands, and in various other ways. Now great care is being\r\ntaken and in most hospitals no children are admitted in the general\r\nwards unless it is determined that they are free from vulvovaginitis.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, vulvovaginitis in children is a mild infection. A\r\nchild may have it for several weeks or months without being aware of\r\nit, without saying anything about it, the diagnosis often being made\r\nby the mother, who begins to notice the creamy discharge on the girl's\r\nlinen or underwear. And this is the principal symptom in little girls\r\nthus afflicted--the discharge. This discharge may be very profuse,\r\ncovering the vulva, vagina, and cervix.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases, there is also an infection of the urethra, and the\r\nchild may complain of burning at urination, itching and pain around\r\nthe vulva and anus, and slight pain in the abdomen. There may be a\r\nmoderate rise in temperature, up to 101 deg. F., and in some instances\r\nthe attack is sufficiently acute to give rise to a chill and fever. A\r\nmild inflammation of the joints may set in within the first weeks of\r\nthe infection, although as a usual thing it comes later on.\r\n\r\n=Evil Sequelae of Vulvovaginitis.= While, as stated, vulvovaginitis is\r\na comparatively mild infection as far as its symptoms are concerned,\r\nit nevertheless has a very bad effect on the child who is unfortunate\r\nenough to become a victim of the disease. First of all, it is an\r\nextremely long drawn, persistent disease. It usually takes months, and\r\nthese months may run into years, before a complete cure, is effected.\r\nSecond, relapses are quite common. Third, the treatment is a\r\ndisagreeable one for the child, and is occasionally painful. Fourth,\r\nit has a disastrous effect on the child's _morale_; most parents,\r\nthough they may love the child most affectionately, look somewhat\r\naskance at it; and continuous vaginal treatment somehow or other has a\r\nhumiliating effect on the child, which begins to consider itself as an\r\noutcast, as something apart from other children. Fifth, the child's\r\neducation is very frequently seriously and permanently interfered\r\nwith, because it must often be taken out of school, whether public or\r\nprivate, and private tutoring is of course feasible only for the few.\r\nSixth, and this is a point not sufficiently appreciated by the\r\nprofession and the laity, but it is an important point, nevertheless:\r\nvulvovaginitis in children has unfortunately a disastrous effect in\r\n_hastening the sexual maturity of the child_. Whether this is due to\r\nthe congestion of the organs produced by the inflammation, or to the\r\nspeculum examinations, paintings, douches, applications, tampons,\r\nsuppositories, etc., the fact remains that girls who suffer from\r\nvulvovaginitis in childhood become sexually mature considerably\r\nearlier than normal girls of the same class, stratum and climate, and\r\ntheir demand for sexual satisfaction is much more insistent. Seventh,\r\na mild vulvovaginitis may be the cause of permanent _sterility_.\r\n\r\nIt will therefore be seen that vulvovaginitis is a calamity, and\r\neverything possible should be done to guard female children from\r\ncontracting it. _All_ children should _always_ sleep alone. Under no\r\ncircumstances should a child sleep with anybody else, be it a sister,\r\na mother, a friend, a governess, or a servant girl. People should be\r\nvery careful in sending their children to spend a night or two with\r\nsome friends. The friends may be all right, but still a friend of the\r\nfriends or a relative of the friends may not be. I have known several\r\ncases where the origin of the vulvovaginitis could be traced to little\r\ngirls spending a week at the house of some friends where a boarder or\r\nrelative was infected with gonorrhea. That children should be kept\r\naway from associating or playing with adults or other children who are\r\nknown to have gonorrheal infection goes without saying. The child's\r\ngenitals should be frequently inspected by the mother, and scrupulous\r\ncleanliness by frequent bathing, sponging with warm solutions and\r\npowdering, should be maintained. The toilet seats in school should\r\nreceive special attention. The wooden seat is a menace because it\r\noften harbors gonorrheal pus from either the female or male genitals,\r\nwhile the only proper seat is one of the so-called U-shaped style,\r\nthat is, one in which the front is entirely open, like the letter U.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\r\n\r\nSYPHILIS\r\n\r\n Syphilis Due to Germ--Syphilis a Constitutional Disease--Primary\r\n  Lesion--Incubation Period--Roseola--Primary Stage--Secondary\r\n  Stage--Mucous Patches--Tertiary Stage--Gumma--Hereditary Nature\r\n  of Syphilis--Milder Course in Women Than in Men--Obscure Symptoms\r\n  in Syphilis--Necessity for Examination by Physician--Locomotor\r\n  Ataxia--Softening of the Brain--Chancroids.\r\n\r\n\r\nSyphilis is a disease caused by a germ called spirocheta; the full\r\nname is spirocheta pallida--a pale, spiral-shaped germ. Though the\r\ndisease has been ravaging Europe and America for centuries, the germ\r\nof it has been discovered only a few years ago, namely, in 1905, and,\r\nlike the gonococcus, also by a German scientist, Fritz Schaudinn.\r\nSyphilis is a constitutional disease. In ten days to three weeks after\r\na person has contracted syphilis, he (or she) develops a sore (at the\r\nspot where the germs got in). This sore is called _chancre_ or\r\n_primary lesion_. But when this sore makes its appearance the\r\nspirochetae and the poison which they elaborate are already circulating\r\nin the blood, all over the system. The disease is already systemic, or\r\nconstitutional, and the chancre is the local expression of a\r\nconstitutional disease. Cutting out the chancre will not cure the\r\ndisease, because, as stated, the germs are already in the system. The\r\ntime between the contraction of the disease (the infectious\r\nintercourse) and the appearance of the chancre is called the\r\n_Incubation Period_. The time between the appearance of the chancre\r\nand the appearance of the rash on the body (the rash looks like a\r\nmeasles rash and is called roseola, which means a rose-colored rash)\r\nis called the _Primary Stage_. It lasts about six weeks. With the\r\nappearance of the rash commences the _Secondary Stage_. This stage is\r\ncharacterized by all sorts of _eruptions_, mild and severe, by white\r\nlittle patches (called mucous patches) in the throat, mouth, tonsils,\r\nvagina, by falling out of the hair, etc. The length of this secondary\r\nstage depends a good deal upon the sort of treatment the patient gets.\r\nImproperly treated, or not treated at all, it may last two or three\r\nyears or more. Properly treated, it may be cut short at once, in a few\r\ndays, so that the patient may never again in his or her life get an\r\neruption. The third or _Tertiary Stage_ is characterized by\r\n_ulcerations_ in various parts of the body and by _swellings_ or\r\ntumors. The name of a syphilitic swelling or tumor is gumma (plural,\r\ngummata). The tertiary stage is the most terrible stage and it used to\r\nbe the terror of syphilitic patients. But at the present time, under\r\nour modern methods of treatment, patients, if properly treated, _never\r\nhave a tertiary stage_. We have seen many patients who considered\r\nsyphilis a trifling disease, because all they knew of their disease\r\nwas the chancre and the first eruption, i.e., the roseola, and perhaps\r\na slight falling out of the hair. They then put themselves under\r\nenergetic treatment, the _activity_ of the disease was checked, and\r\nthey never had another symptom afterwards, though a Wassermann test\r\nshowed that the disease was not entirely eradicated. It was merely\r\nheld in check--which is the second best thing.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: SPIROCHETA PALLIDA, OR TREPONEMA PALLIDUM, THE\r\n   GERM OF SYPHILIS AS SEEN UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.]\r\n\r\nAs stated before, syphilis is the most hereditary of all diseases.\r\nFortunately, if the disease is still very active in the parents,\r\nparticularly in the mother, the child is generally aborted. Some\r\nsyphilitic mothers will have half a dozen or more miscarriages in\r\nsuccession. When the disease has become \"attenuated,\" either by\r\ntreatment or by itself--many diseases lose their virulence in\r\ntime--the child may be carried to term. It then may be born dead, or\r\nit may be born strongly syphilitic, and die in a few days or weeks, or\r\nit may be born without any signs of syphilis and be apparently healthy\r\nand then develop the disease at the age of ten, twelve, fourteen, or\r\nlater, or it may be born healthy and remain healthy. But no woman who\r\nhad syphilis, or whose husband had syphilis, should _dare_ to conceive\r\nor to give birth to a child unless she has been given permission by a\r\ncompetent physician. I mean just what I say. It is not a personal\r\nmatter. A woman has a right to marry a syphilitic husband if she wants\r\nto and run the risk of contracting syphilis. Her body is her own, and\r\nif she does it with her eyes open it is her affair. But a woman has no\r\nright to bring into the world syphilitic or syphilitically tainted\r\nchildren. Here society has a right to interfere.\r\n\r\nSyphilis runs a milder course in women than it does in men. But this\r\nmilder course is not an unmixed blessing; it may be considered a\r\nmisfortune, because, the same as gonorrhea in women, syphilis is often\r\npresent for months and years until it has made such inroads that it\r\nis but little amenable to treatment. In many women the disease runs\r\nsuch a mild course, as far as definite symptoms are concerned, that\r\nthey are sure they never had anything the matter with them, and they\r\nare perfectly sincere in their denial of ever having had any\r\ninfection. Often it is only when they complain of obscure symptoms,\r\nfor which we can find no explanation, and then take a Wassermann test,\r\nthat we discover what the real trouble is. And then the internal\r\norgans are sometimes found so deeply affected that it is hard to do\r\nanything. So it is seen that the mildness of the course of the\r\ndisease, while a good thing in itself, is bad in that respect that it\r\nprevents timely treatment. It is therefore important that whenever a\r\nwoman is in any way suspicious that she may have the disease that she\r\nhave herself examined; and if she has reasons to suspect that her\r\nhusband or partner has the disease, she should persuade him to have\r\nhimself examined.\r\n\r\nLocomotor ataxia, one of the most terrible sequelae of syphilis, is\r\nmuch more rare in women than it is in men. So is general paresis, also\r\ncalled general paralysis of the insane, or softening of the brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chancroids=\r\n\r\nThere is one other minor disease belonging to the venereal diseases;\r\nthat is chancroids. Chancroids are little ulcers on the genitals; they\r\nare purely local and do not affect the system. They are due largely to\r\nuncleanliness, and are found only among the poorer classes of\r\nprostitutes and therefore among the poorer classes of men. One sees\r\nthem now and then in public dispensaries, but in private practice they\r\nare now quite rare. They used to be quite common, which shows that the\r\ngeneral level of cleanliness has been raised considerably among all\r\nclasses of people. At any rate, chancroids are of little significance,\r\nas compared with syphilis and gonorrhea, and when speaking of the\r\nvenereal peril, these are the two diseases we have in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\r\n\r\nTHE CURABILITY OF VENEREAL DISEASE\r\n\r\n Gonorrhea May Be Practically Cured in Every Case in Man--Extensive\r\n  Gonorrheal Infection in Woman Difficult to Cure--Positive Cure in\r\n  Syphilis Impossible to Guarantee.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as the usual statements in regard to the extent of venereal\r\ndisease have been found untrue or greatly exaggerated, so do the\r\nstatements regarding the curability or rather incurability of venereal\r\ndisease need careful revision. The picture usually painted of the\r\nhopelessness of gonorrhea and syphilis is too sombre, too black, and,\r\ncontrary to the assertions made by laymen and laywomen and physicians\r\nwho do not specialize in the treatment of venereal disease, I wish to\r\nmake the statement that every case of gonorrhea in man, without any\r\nexception, if properly treated, can be perfectly cured, _as far as\r\npractical purposes are concerned_. I add the last phrase because the\r\ncure may not be perfect in the scientific sense of the word; that is,\r\nthe man may not be brought back into the condition in which he was\r\nbefore he got the disease. But, for all practical purposes, as far as\r\nhe himself is concerned, as far as his wife is concerned, and as far\r\nas the future children are concerned, every case may be cured, without\r\nany doubt. And I say this, basing myself upon a varied professional\r\nexperience extending over nearly a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nAs to gonorrhea in women, that depends to a great extent upon the\r\nvirulence of the disease and the promptness with which treatment is\r\ninstituted. If the gonorrhea is limited only to the cervix, the vulva\r\nand the urethra, then prompt treatment will usually bring about a cure\r\nin a comparatively short time. But if the gonorrheal inflammation has\r\nextended to the body of the uterus, or still worse, to the tubes, then\r\nthe treatment may become a very tedious one, and some cases may not be\r\ncurable without an operation.\r\n\r\nWith syphilis the matter is different. Since the introduction by\r\nEhrlich of the various arsenic preparations, we have much better\r\nsuccess in the treatment of syphilis, and we can positively render\r\nevery case non-infectious to the partner. But, as to guaranteeing a\r\npositive cure, that is, guaranteeing that the patient will never have\r\nan outbreak or relapse of his disease in the future, and that the\r\nchildren will be perfectly free from any taint, this we can do no more\r\nnow than we could before the modern treatment of syphilis was\r\nintroduced. The decision, therefore, as to whether we may or may not\r\npermit a once syphilitic patient to marry will depend a great deal\r\nupon whether or no the husband or the wife or both desire to have\r\nchildren. If this is the case, we must often withhold our permission;\r\nbut if the man and woman agree to get married and to get along without\r\nchildren, we will grant permission to the marriage in the vast\r\nmajority of cases. The subject of venereal disease and marriage will\r\nbe further discussed in separate chapters.\r\n\r\nVenereal disease, I have to repeat, is terrible enough in itself,\r\nwithout any exaggeration, without picturing it in too black colors.\r\nAnd it is necessary that people should not have too black an idea of\r\nit. It is necessary that they know that there are thousands and tens\r\nof thousands of patients who suffered with gonorrhea or syphilis and\r\nwho were perfectly cured, who married, and whose wives remained\r\nperfectly well, and who gave birth to perfectly healthy untainted\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\r\n\r\nVENEREAL PROPHYLAXIS\r\n\r\n Necessity for Douching Before and After Suspicious Intercourse--\r\n  Formulae for Douches--Precautions Against Non-venereal Sources of\r\n  Infection--Syphilis Transmitted by Dentist's Instruments--\r\n  Manicurists and Syphilis--Promiscuous Kissing a Source of\r\n  Syphilitic Infection.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his book, _Sex Knowledge for Men_, the author treated the subject\r\nof prevention of venereal disease very thoroughly. Men need this\r\nknowledge. As men _will_ indulge in illicit relations, we must teach\r\nthem to guard themselves against venereal infection. We must do it not\r\nonly for their own sake, but for the sake of their wives and children.\r\nFor, infection in the man may mean infection in his wife and children.\r\nBut as women readers of this book are not likely to indulge in\r\npromiscuous relations with strangers, a detailed discussion of the\r\nsubject would be out of place.\r\n\r\nI will merely say, that where the woman has a suspicion that her\r\nhusband is in an infectious state, she should abstain from relations\r\nwith him until she is sure that he is safe. But where for some reason\r\na suspicions intercourse is indulged in, the woman should use an\r\nantiseptic douche _before_ and _after_ intercourse. Where it is\r\ninconvenient to use a douche both before and after, a douche after\r\nwill have to suffice, but it is much safer and surer to use the douche\r\nboth before and after. When you use a douche there is always some of\r\nthe solution left in the vagina and that destroys wholly or in part\r\nthe infective germs. The following makes an effective douche: Dissolve\r\na tablet of bichloride (they come on the market of the weight of about\r\n7-1/2 grains) in two quarts of water--hot, lukewarm or cold. Use before\r\nintercourse a small amount--about a pint or half a pint, and use the\r\nbalance after intercourse. Instead of the bichloride you may use a\r\ntablespoonful of carbolic acid, or two tablets of chinosol, or a\r\ntablespoonful of lysol, or two tablespoonfuls of boric acid.\r\n\r\nInstead of the douche an antiseptic jelly in a collapsible tin tube\r\nwith a long nozzle may be used.\r\n\r\nBut besides the venereal sources of infection the woman must guard\r\nagainst the non-venereal sources. Do not ever, if you can avoid it,\r\nuse a public toilet. If you are forced to use it, protect yourself by\r\nputting some paper over the seat.\r\n\r\nDo not use a public drinking cup. If you have to use one, keep your\r\nlips away from the rim. One can learn to drink without touching the\r\nrim of the glass or cup with the lips.\r\n\r\nDo not under any circumstances use a public towel. The roller towel is\r\na menace to health and should be forbidden in every part of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIf you have to sleep in a hotel or in a strange bed, make sure that\r\nthe linen is clean and fresh. Never sleep on bed linen which has been\r\nused by a stranger.\r\n\r\nNever use a public brush or comb.\r\n\r\nBe sure that your dentist is a careful, up-to-date man, and sterilizes\r\nhis instruments carefully. Many a case of syphilis has been\r\ntransmitted by a dentist's instrument. A syphilitic who goes to a\r\ndentist to be treated generally conceals his disease, and if the\r\ndentist is not in the habit of sterilizing his instruments after each\r\npatient, disaster may result.\r\n\r\nBe sure that your manicurist is not syphilitic, or at least that her\r\nhands are healthy, clean and free from any eruption.\r\n\r\nAnd, last but not least, do not indulge in promiscuous kissing. This\r\nis a particularly important injunction for young girls. This is a real\r\nperil and there are thousands of cases of syphilis that are known to\r\nhave been contracted directly from kissing. People suffering with\r\nsyphilis often have little white sores (mucous patches) on their lips,\r\ntongue and inside of cheeks. These sores are very infectious, and by\r\nkissing the disease is readily transmitted. Kissing games have been\r\nresponsible in more than one case for the spread of syphilis to many\r\npersons. I have now under treatment a girl of nineteen who contracted\r\nsyphilis on her summer vacation from having kissed a man once. Avoid\r\npromiscuous kissing! It is a bad practice for more than one reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\r\n\r\nALCOHOL, SEX AND VENEREAL DISEASE\r\n\r\n Alcoholic Indulgence and Venereal Disease--A Champagne Dinner and\r\n  Syphilis--Percentage of Cases of Venereal Infection Due to\r\n  Alcohol--Artificial Stimulation of Sex Instinct in Man and in\r\n  Woman--Reckless Sexual Indulgence Due to Alcohol--Alcohol as an\r\n  Aid to Seduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Bacchus, the god of wine, is the strongest ally of Venus, the\r\ngoddess of love, using love in its physical sense, as the French use\r\nthe word _amour_, has been well known to the ancient Greeks and\r\nRomans, as it is well known to-day to every saloon-keeper and every\r\nkeeper of a disreputable house. And all measures to combat venereal\r\ndisease and to prevent girls from making a false step will be only\r\npartially successful if we do not at the same time carry on a strong\r\neducational campaign against alcoholic indulgence. Of what use to\r\nyoung men is the knowledge of the venereal peril and familiarity with\r\nthe use of venereal prophylactics, when under the influence of alcohol\r\nthe mind is befuddled, they forget everything and do things that they\r\nnever would do in the sober state? Of what use are warnings to a\r\ngirl, when under the influence of a heavy dinner and a bottle of\r\nchampagne, to which she is unaccustomed, her passion is aroused to a\r\ndegree she has never experienced before, her will is paralyzed and she\r\nyields, though deep down in her consciousness something tells her she\r\nshouldn't? Yields, becomes pregnant, and is in the deepest agony for\r\nseveral months, and has a wound which will probably never heal for the\r\nrest of her life? Of what use have all the lectures, books and\r\nmaternal injunctions been to her?\r\n\r\nOr this case. Here is a young lawyer, twenty-eight years of age,\r\nengaged to a fine girl, and with everything to look forward to. He\r\nalways was very moderate and circumspect in his sexual indulgence,\r\nand, though careful in choosing his partners, he never failed to use a\r\nvenereal prophylactic after intercourse. There was too much at stake\r\nfor him, and he did not care to take any chances, even if the chances\r\nwere one in a thousand. For a period of one year during which he had\r\nbeen engaged he abstained from sexual intercourse altogether, though\r\nit cost him a great deal of effort to do so. He was to be married very\r\nshortly. But ill-luck made him accept an invitation to a bachelor\r\ndinner, where champagne and smutty stories were flowing freely, too\r\nfreely. He left about midnight, and as the night was beautiful he\r\ndecided to walk home. He met a siren, who invited him to accompany\r\nher. Under other circumstances he would have sent her on her way, or\r\nat least he would have stepped into a drugstore for a prophylactic.\r\nBut, excited by the wine, the smutty stories and the year's\r\nabstinence, he went along like a sheep, as a matter of course, without\r\ntrying to reason or interposing any objections. He remembers\r\ndistinctly his feelings and the state of his mind. He was not drunk,\r\nonly exhilarated, but nevertheless the whole thing seemed to him so\r\nnormal, so natural, so expected, so matter-of-course, that he couldn't\r\nthink of acting otherwise than accept her invitation. And he stayed\r\ntwo or three hours; and he used no prophylactic. And as a\r\nresult--three weeks later he had a typical primary syphilitic lesion.\r\nHow he felt and what it all meant to him the reader can imagine. This\r\nis far from being an isolated, an exceptional case.\r\n\r\nFrom my own practice I could cite a number of cases of venereal\r\ninfection in which alcohol was the direct, primary factor. How many\r\nsuch cases there are altogether in the period of a year nobody can\r\nsay, but that they constitute a considerable percentage of the total\r\nvenereal morbidity every investigating sexologist will testify. Forel\r\nclaims that 76 per cent. of all venereal infection takes place under\r\nthe influence of alcohol; Notthaft is more moderate, more\r\ndiscriminating in his statistics and his claims are--30 per cent. An\r\nanalysis of 1,000 cases of venereal infection, just published by Dr.\r\nHugo Hecht (_Venerische Infektion und Alkohol, Z.B.G._, Vol. XVI, No.\r\n11) gives over 40 per cent. And the saddest part of it is that among\r\nthe infected were 75 married men (the author thinks there were more,\r\nbut only 75 confessed to being married), and of these, 45, equivalent\r\nto 60 per cent., were under the influence of alcohol when they\r\ncontracted their venereal disease (extra-matrimonially, of course).\r\n\r\nAlcoholic indulgence contributes to the spread of venereal disease\r\ndirectly and indirectly. First and foremost it increases enormously\r\nthe amount of intercourse indulged in. I certainly do not belong to\r\nthose who believe that the sex instinct is merely a vicious appetite,\r\nlike the appetite for alcohol or drugs, which can easily and\r\ncompletely be suppressed by the exertion of will-power. I believe that\r\nthe sex instinct can be suppressed only within reasonable limits; if\r\nan attempt is made to exceed these limits dire results are apt to\r\nfollow. But I also believe that the sex instinct can be stimulated\r\nartificially beyond the natural needs, and among the artificial\r\nstimulants of the sex instinct alcohol occupies first place. And bear\r\nin mind that alcohol produces even a stronger effect on women, in\r\nexciting the sexual passion, than it does on men. Women are more\r\neasily upset by stimulants and narcotics, and that is the reason why\r\nit is more dangerous for women to drink than it is for men.\r\n\r\nSo this, then, is count number one: The man and the woman who in a\r\nsober condition would easily abstain, with their libido stimulated and\r\ntheir will-power paralyzed by alcohol, indulge unnecessarily, with the\r\nrisk of venereal infection to the man and the double risk of venereal\r\ninfection and pregnancy to the woman. Count two: The man who in the\r\nsober condition would use care and discrimination, under the influence\r\nof alcohol soon loses all his judgment and sees an angel and a Helen\r\nof Troy in the worst and most impudent harlot; with the result that\r\nthe chances of venereal infection are greatly increased. Count three:\r\nWhere under ordinary circumstances the man would stay a few minutes to\r\nhalf an hour, under the influence of alcohol he stays several hours,\r\nor all night, thus increasing his chances of infection a hundredfold.\r\nCount four: Alcohol increases the congestion in the genital organs of\r\nboth man and woman and renders them much more _susceptible_ to\r\ninfection. All other factors being equal, a connection which will\r\nunder strict sobriety remain without bad results, may when one or\r\nboth partners are under the influence of alcohol be followed by\r\ninfection. Count five: The man who is in the habit of using venereal\r\nprophylactics under the influence of alcohol becomes both careless and\r\nreckless; he looks with contempt at preventive measures and the result\r\nis--venereal disease.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give statistics and exact or even approximate\r\nfigures. But there is no question in my mind, in the mind of any\r\ncareful investigator, that if alcoholic beverages could be eliminated,\r\nthe number of cases of venereal infection would be diminished by about\r\none-half. And what is true of venereal disease is also true of\r\nseduction of young girls. Alcohol is the most efficient weapon that\r\neither the refined Don Juan or the vulgar pimp has in his possession.\r\n\r\nYou cannot hope for complete success in eliminating venereal disease\r\nand seduction unless you also eliminate alcoholism. For Bacchus is the\r\nally not only of Venus Aphrodite but also of Venus vulgivaga.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE AND GONORRHEA\r\n\r\n Decision of Physician Regarding Marriage of Patients Infected with\r\n  Gonorrhea or Syphilis--Advisability of Certificate of Freedom\r\n  from Transmissible Disease--Premarital Examination as a Universal\r\n  Custom--When a Man Who Had Gonorrhea May Be Allowed to Marry--\r\n  When a Woman Who Had Gonorrhea May be Allowed to Marry--Antisepsis\r\n  Before Coitus--Question of Sterility in the Man Who Has Had\r\n  Gonorrhea Easily Answered--Impossibility of Determining Whether\r\n  the Woman is Fertile or Not.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a man or a woman who has once suffered from gonorrhea or syphilis\r\nto enter matrimony without having secured a competent physician's\r\nopinion is a great responsibility. And a great responsibility rests\r\nupon the shoulders of the physician who is called upon to give such an\r\nopinion. For, a wrong decision--a wrong decision either way--that is,\r\npermission to marry when permission should not have been granted or\r\nrefusal to give permission when permission should have been\r\ngranted--may be responsible for much future unhappiness and much\r\ndisease: disease of the mother and of the offspring. It may even be\r\nresponsible for death.\r\n\r\nThere is no easy, short road to a positive opinion. It requires a\r\nthorough, painstaking examination at the hands of an experienced\r\nphysician, one thoroughly familiar with all the modern tests, to tell\r\nwhether it is safe for a man who once suffered from venereal disease\r\nto enter the bonds of matrimony. Sometimes one examination is not\r\nsufficient, and several examinations may be necessary; but, the\r\nopinion of a conscientious, experienced physician may be relied upon,\r\nand, if all men and women who once suffered from venereal disease\r\nwould seek for, and be guided by, such an opinion, there would be no\r\ncases of marital infection, there would be no children afflicted with\r\ngonorrheal ophthalmia, there would be no cases of hereditary syphilis.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe that a time will come when all venereal disease will\r\nhave disappeared from the face of the earth. But, until that time\r\ncomes, it would be for the benefit of the race and of posterity if\r\npeople had to present a certificate of freedom from transmissible\r\nvenereal disease as a prerequisite to a marriage license. Custom is\r\noften more efficient than law, and, if a premarital examination should\r\nbecome a universal custom (and there are indications in this\r\ndirection), no law would be needed.\r\n\r\n=When May a Man Who Had Gonorrhea Get Married?= For a man who once\r\nsuffered from gonorrhea to be pronounced cured and a safe candidate\r\nfor marriage, the following conditions must be present:\r\n\r\n1. There must be no discharge.\r\n\r\n2. The urine must be perfectly clear and free from shreds.\r\n\r\n3. The secretion from the prostate gland, as obtained by prostatic\r\nmassage, and from the seminal vesicles, as obtained by \"milking,\" or\r\n\"stripping,\" the vesicles, must be free from pus and gonococci. To\r\nmake sure, it is best to repeat such examination at three different\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n4. There must be neither stricture nor patches in the urethra.\r\n\r\n5. What we call the complement-fixation test, which is a blood test\r\nfor gonorrhea similar to the Wassermann blood-test for syphilis, must\r\nbe negative.\r\n\r\nReferring to conditions 1 and 2, it sometimes happens that the patient\r\nhas a minute amount of discharge or a few shreds in the urine, and I\r\nstill permit him to marry; but this is done only after the discharge\r\nand shreds have been repeatedly examined and have been found to be\r\ncatarrhal in character and absolutely free from any gonococci or other\r\ngerms.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that a patient comes to me for an examination a\r\nfew days before the date set for the wedding. I examine him and find\r\nthat he is not in a safe condition to marry, and so advise him to\r\ndelay the wedding. Sometimes he follows the advice, but in some cases\r\nhe is unable to do so. He claims the wedding has been arranged, the\r\ninvitation-cards have been sent out, and to delay the wedding would\r\nlead to endless trouble and perhaps scandal. In such cases I, of\r\ncourse, assume no responsibility; however, I do advise the man to use\r\nan antiseptic suppository or some other method that will protect the\r\nbride from infection for the time being, while he, the husband, has an\r\nopportunity to take treatment until cured. Of the many cases in which\r\nI advised this method, I do not know of one in which infection has\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\n=When May a Woman Who Once Had Gonorrhea Be Permitted to Marry?= In\r\nthe case of a woman, the decision may be harder to reach than in that\r\nof a man. Of course, the urine must be clear and the urethra must be\r\nnormal; however, we cannot insist that there must be no discharge.\r\nThis, because practically every woman has some slight discharge; even,\r\nif not all the time, then at least immediately prior and subsequent to\r\nmenstruation. Of course, the discharge must be free from gonococci and\r\npus. Also the complement-fixation tests must be negative. But, even\r\nso, we cannot be absolutely sure, because gonococci may be hidden in\r\nthe uterus or in the Fallopian tubes.\r\n\r\nHere, we have to go a good deal by the history given us. If the woman,\r\nduring the course of the gonorrhea, had salpingitis, that is, an\r\ninflammation of the Fallopian tubes, then we can never say positively\r\nthat she is cured; all we can say, at best, is: presumably cured. And,\r\nfurther, if she has no pains in the uterine appendages, either\r\nspontaneous or on examination, and, if several examinations made\r\nwithin a day or two following menstruation are negative, then we may\r\nassume that she is cured. It is important, though, that this\r\nexamination be made on the last day of menstruation or on the first or\r\nsecond day following; for there are many cases in which no pus and no\r\ngonococci will show in the inter-menstrual period, but will appear on\r\nthose particular days, because, if the gonococci are hidden high up,\r\nthey are likely to come down with the menstrual blood and portions of\r\nmucous membrane that are shed during menstruation.\r\n\r\nAt best, it is a delicate problem, so that whenever there has been the\r\nleast suspicion that the woman may harbor gonococci I have always\r\nadvised (as is my custom, to be on the safe side) and directed the\r\nwoman to use either an antiseptic suppository or an antiseptic douche\r\nbefore coitus. With these precautions adopted, I have never had an\r\naccident happen.\r\n\r\n=The Question of Probable Sterility.= Thus far I have considered the\r\nproblem of marriage from the standpoint of infectivity. But, we know\r\nthat, besides the effect on the individual, gonorrhea has also a\r\nfar-reaching influence on the race; in other words, that it is prone\r\nto make the subjects--both men and women--sterile. And a candidate for\r\nmarriage may, and often does, want to know whether, besides being\r\nnoninfective, he or she is capable of begetting or having children.\r\n\r\nIn the case of man, the problem is, fortunately, a very simple one. We\r\ncan easily obtain a specimen of the man's semen and determine, by\r\nmeans of the microscope, whether it contains spermatozoa or not. If it\r\ndoes contain a normal number of lively, rapidly moving spermatozoa,\r\nthe man is fertile, regardless of whether he ever had epididymitis or\r\nnot. If the semen contains no spermatozoa, or only a few deformed or\r\nlazily moving ones, then he is sterile.\r\n\r\nIn the case of woman, it is _absolutely_ impossible to determine\r\nwhether the gonorrhea has made her sterile or not; because there is no\r\nway of expressing an ovum from the ovary. The woman may not have had\r\nany pain or inflammation in the Fallopian tubes, and yet there may\r\nhave been sufficient inflammation to close up the orifices of the\r\ntubes. On the other hand, she may have had a severe salpingitis on\r\n_both sides and still be fertile_. Nor is there any way of telling\r\nwhether the ovaries were so involved in the process as to become\r\nincapable of generating healthy ova, or any ova at all. In short,\r\nthere is absolutely no way of telling whether a woman is sterile or\r\nfertile--we can only surmise. And our surmise in this respect is\r\nliable to be wrong just as often as right. The only way the question\r\ncan be decided is by experience. If the prospective husband is willing\r\nto take a chance, well and good.\r\n\r\nWhile just as many girls marry as do young men, still, in practice, we\r\nalways shall have to examine an incomparably larger number of male\r\nthan of female candidates. This is due, not only to the fact that an\r\nincomparably larger number of men suffer from venereal disease, but\r\nalso because very few women will confess to their fiances that they\r\never entertained antematrimonial relations and--what is still\r\nworse--were infected with venereal disease. This, of course, is owing\r\nto our double standard of morality, which looks upon as a trivial or\r\nno offense in the man what it condemns as a heinous crime in the\r\nwoman. I have known hundreds of men who confessed freely to their\r\nfiancees that they had had gonorrhea, but I have known only two girls\r\nwho made a confession of the fact to their future husbands. They got\r\nmarried, however, and lived happily with their husbands ever after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE AND SYPHILIS\r\n\r\n Rules for Permitting a Syphilitic Patient to Marry--Rules More\r\n  Severe in Cases Where Children Are Desired--Where Both Partners\r\n  Are Syphilitic--Danger of Paresis in Some Syphilitic Patients--A\r\n  Case in the Author's Practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of the syphilitic differs from the problem of the\r\nexgonorrheal patient. When a gonorrheal patient is cured, so far as\r\ninfectivity is concerned, and is not sterile, there is no apprehension\r\nas to the offspring. Gonorrhea is not hereditary, and the child of a\r\ngonorrheal patient does not differ from the child of a nongonorrheal\r\nperson. In the case of syphilis, it is different. The patient may be\r\nsafe so far as infecting the partner is concerned, but yet there may\r\nbe danger for the offspring.\r\n\r\nThe rules for permitting a man or a woman who once had syphilis to\r\nmarry, therefore, are different from those applied to the gonorrheal\r\npatient. Here are the rules:\r\n\r\n1. I would make it an invariable rule that no syphilitic patient\r\nshould marry or should be permitted to marry before _five_ years have\r\nelapsed from the day of infection. But the period of time alone is\r\nnot sufficient; other conditions must be met before we may give a\r\nsyphilitic patient permission to marry.\r\n\r\n2. The man or the woman must have received thorough systematic\r\ntreatment for at least three years, either constantly or off and on,\r\naccording to the physician's judgment.\r\n\r\n3. For at least one year before the intended marriage, the person must\r\nhave been absolutely free from any manifestations of syphilis; that\r\nis, from any eruptions on the skin, from any mucous patches, swelling\r\nin the bones, ulcerations, and so on.\r\n\r\n4. Four Wassermann tests, taken at intervals of three months and at a\r\ntime _when the patient was receiving no specific treatment_, must be\r\nabsolutely negative.\r\n\r\nIf these four conditions are fully met, then the patient may be\r\npermitted to marry.\r\n\r\nIt is important, however, to state that, in permitting or refusing\r\nsyphilitic persons to marry, we are guided to a great extent by the\r\nfact as to whether they _expect to have children soon or not_.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a couple who are anxious to have children soon after\r\ntheir marriage, the conditions for our permission must be more severe\r\nthan when the couple are willing or anxious to use contraceptive\r\nmeasures for the first years of their married life. For, if a man is\r\nfree from any skin lesions and from any mucous patches, his wife is\r\nsafe from infection _as long as she does not become pregnant_. But, if\r\nshe does get pregnant, she may become infected through the fetus; and,\r\nof course, the child also is liable to be syphilitic. Hence, much\r\nstricter requirements for syphilitics who expect to become parents are\r\nnecessary than for those who do not.\r\n\r\nIn case both the man and the woman are or have been syphilitic,\r\npermission to marry may be granted without hesitation, as the danger\r\nof infection is absent, but permission to have children must be\r\nrefused _absolutely_ and _unequivocally_. Regardless of the time that\r\nmay have elapsed from the period of infection, regardless of\r\ntreatment, regardless of Wassermann tests, the danger to the child is\r\ntoo great if both parents have the syphilitic taint in them. A healthy\r\nchild _may_ be born from two syphilitic parents who have undergone\r\nenergetic treatment, but we have no right to take the chance. I, at\r\nleast, never wanted to, nor ever will want to, take such a\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n=The Danger of Locomotor Ataxia or Paresis.= There is still one more\r\npoint to consider in dealing with a syphilitic patient. In patients\r\nwho did not receive energetic treatment from the very beginning of the\r\ndisease as also in patients whose treatment was only desultory and\r\nirregular, we never can guarantee, in spite of lack of external\r\nsymptoms, in spite of a negative Wassermann reaction, that some\r\ntrouble may not develop later in life.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we do in such cases and what particularly shall we do if,\r\nfrom a general examination of the patient, we carry away the\r\nimpression that, while free from the danger of infection, the man is\r\nnot a good risk? Under these circumstances, we must refuse all\r\npersonal responsibility, leaving the assumption of the responsibility\r\nto the prospective wife.\r\n\r\nHere is a case in point. About five years ago a man came to me for\r\nexamination; he came with his fiancee. He had contracted syphilis ten\r\nyears previously, received irregular treatment by mouth, off and on.\r\nFor five years, he had had no symptoms of any kind. He _considered_\r\nhimself cured, but wanted to know, and his fiancee wanted to know,\r\nwhether he really was cured. There were no symptoms of any kind and\r\nthe Wassermann test was negative. Nevertheless, I could not give him a\r\nclean bill of health. I noticed what seemed to me a slowness in\r\nthinking and just the least bit of hesitation in his speech.\r\n\r\nI told the girl (the man was thirty-five, she was thirty-two) that I\r\ncould not render a definite decision in the matter, that everything\r\nmight be all right, and then again it might not; but, that the\r\nquestion about children she would have to decide definitely, once for\r\nall, namely, that she was not to have any children. She was fully\r\nsatisfied so far as that part was concerned; she said she herself\r\nobjected to children and did not intend to have any and knew how to\r\ntake care of herself. All she wanted to know was, whether she was in\r\ndanger of being infected. I told her no, but that in my opinion there\r\nwas some danger of her husband developing general paresis or locomotor\r\nataxia.\r\n\r\nThe girl had been a teacher for about twelve years, and she was so\r\nsick at heart of the work, was so anxious for a home of her own, that\r\nshe decided to take the risk. And they got married. The marriage\r\nremained childless. The man developed general paresis (softening of\r\nthe brain) three years later and died about a year afterward. The\r\nwoman, now a widow, I understand, is not sorry for the step she had\r\ntaken. This shows what things our social-economic conditions and our\r\nmoral code are responsible for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\r\n\r\nWHO MAY AND WHO MAY NOT MARRY\r\n\r\n The Physician Often Consulted as to Advisability of\r\n  Marriage--_Venereal Disease_ the Most Common Question--\r\n  _Tuberculosis_--Sexual Appetite of Tubercular Patients--Effect\r\n  of Pregnancy Contraceptive Knowledge for Tubercular Wife--\r\n  _Heart Disease_--Serious Bar to Marriage--Influence of Sexual\r\n  Intercourse--_Cancer_--Fear of Hereditary Transmission--\r\n  _Exophthalmic Goiter_--Most Frequent in Women--Simple Goiter--\r\n  Exceptions to Rule--_Obesity_--Family History--Obesity and\r\n  Stoutness Not Synonymous--_Arteriosclerosis_--Danger in Sexual\r\n  Act--_Gout_--Real Causes of Gout--_Mumps_--Parotid Glands and Sex\r\n  Organs--Mumps and Sterility--Ooephoritis Due to Mumps--\r\n  _Hemophilia_--Hemophilic Sons May Marry--Hemophilic Daughters May\r\n  Not Marry--_Anemia_--_Chlorosis_--_Epilepsy_--Hysteria--Symptoms of\r\n  Hysteria--Marriage of Hysterical Women--_Alcoholism_--Effect on\r\n  Offspring--Alcoholics and Impotence--_Feeblemindedness_--Evil\r\n  Effects on Offspring--Sterilization of Feebleminded Only\r\n  Preventive--_Insanity_--Functional Insanity--Organic Insanity--\r\n  Hereditary Transmissibility of Insanity--Fear Resulting in\r\n  Insanity--Environment versus Heredity in Insanity--_Neurosis_--\r\n  _Neurasthenia_--_Psychasthenia_--_Neuropathy_--_Psychopathy_--Nervous\r\n  Conditions and Genius--Sexual Impotence and Genius--_Drug\r\n  Addiction_--External Causes--_Consanguineous Marriages_--When\r\n  Consanguineous Marriages are Advisable--Offspring of Consanguineous\r\n  Marriages--Homosexuality--Homosexuals Often Ignorant of Their\r\n  Condition--Sexual Repression and Homosexuality--Sadism and\r\n  Divorce--Masochism--Sexual Impotence and Marriage--Effect Upon\r\n  the Wife--Frigidity--Marital Relations and Frigid Woman--Excessive\r\n  Libido and Marriage--Excessive Demands Upon Wife--Satyriasis--\r\n  The Excessively Libidinous Wife--Nymphomania--Treatment--Harelip--\r\n  Myopia--Astigmatism--Premature Baldness--Criminality--Crime as\r\n  Result of Environment--Legal and Moral Crime--Ancestral Criminality\r\n  and Marriage--Rules of Heredity--Pauperism--Difference Between\r\n  Pauperism and Poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn former years, nobody thought of asking a physician for permission\r\nto get married. He was not consulted in the matter at all. The parents\r\nwould investigate the young man's social standing, his ability to make\r\na living, his habits perhaps, whether he was a drinking man or not,\r\nbut to ask the physician's expert advice--why, as said, nobody thought\r\nof it. And how much sorrow and unhappiness, how many tragedies the\r\ndoctor could have averted, if he had been asked in time! Fortunately,\r\nin the last few years, a great change has taken place in this respect.\r\nIt is now a very common occurrence for the intelligent layman and\r\nlaywoman, imbued with a sense of responsibility for the welfare of\r\ntheir presumptive future offspring and actuated, perhaps, also by some\r\nfear of infection, to consult a physician as to the advisability of\r\nthe marriage, leaving it to him to make the decision and they abiding\r\nby that decision.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, as often is the case, the pendulum now is in\r\ndanger of swinging to the other extreme; for, a little knowledge is a\r\ndangerous thing, and the tendency of the layman is to exaggerate\r\nmatters and to take things in an absolute instead of in a relative\r\nmanner. As a result, many laymen and laywomen nowadays insist upon a\r\nthorough examination of their own person and the person of their\r\nfuture partner, when there is nothing the matter with either. Still,\r\nthis is a minor evil, and it is better to be too careful than not\r\ncareful enough.\r\n\r\nI am frequently consulted as to the advisability or nonadvisability of\r\na certain marriage taking place. I, therefore, thought it desirable to\r\ndiscuss in a separate chapter the various factors, physical and\r\nmental, personal and ancestral, likely to exert an influence upon the\r\nmarital partner and on the expected offspring, and to state as briefly\r\nas possible and so far as our present state of knowledge permits which\r\nfactors may be considered eugenic, or favorable to the offspring, and\r\ndysgenic, or unfavorable to the offspring.\r\n\r\nThe questions concerning the advisability of marriage which the layman\r\nas well as the physician have most often to deal with are questions\r\nconcerning venereal disease. On account of the importance of the\r\nsubject, these have been discussed rather in detail under the headings\r\n\"Gonorrhea and Marriage\" and \"Syphilis and Marriage.\" Other factors\r\naffecting marriage, either in the eugenic or dysgenic sense, will be\r\ndiscussed more briefly in the present chapter, and more or less in\r\nthe order of their importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tuberculosis=\r\n\r\nTuberculosis, which carries off such a large part of humanity every\r\nyear, is caused by the well-known bacillus tuberculosis, discovered by\r\nKoch. The germ is generally inhaled through the respiratory tract, and\r\nmost frequently settles in the lungs, giving rise to what is known as\r\npulmonary consumption. However, many other organs and tissues may be\r\naffected by tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis used to be considered the hereditary disease _par\r\nexcellence_. Entire families were carried off by it, and, seeing a\r\ntuberculous father or mother and then tuberculous children, it was\r\nassumed that the infection had been transmitted to the children by\r\nheredity. As a matter of fact, the disease was spread by infection. In\r\nformer years, little care was exercised about destroying the sputum;\r\nthe patients would spit indiscriminately on the floor, and the sputum,\r\ndrying up, would be mixed with the dust and inhaled. Often the\r\nchildren crawling on the floor would introduce the infective material\r\ndirectly, by putting their little fingers in their mouths.\r\n\r\nIt is now known that tuberculosis is not a hereditary disease, that\r\nis, that the germs are not transmitted by heredity. _The weak\r\nconstitution_, however, which favors the development of tuberculosis,\r\nis inherited. And children of tuberculous parents, therefore, must not\r\nonly be guarded against infection, but must be brought up with special\r\ncare, so as to strengthen their resistance and overcome the weakened\r\nconstitution which they inherited.\r\n\r\nThat a person with an active tuberculous lesion should not get married\r\ngoes without saying. But, it is a good rule to follow for a\r\ntuberculous person not to marry for two or three years, until all\r\ntuberculous lesions have been declared healed by a competent\r\nphysician. As a rule, a tuberculous patient is a poor provider, and\r\nthat also counts in the advice against marriage. Then sexual\r\nintercourse has, as a rule, a strong influence on the development of\r\nthe disease. Unfortunately the sexual appetite of tuberculous patients\r\nis not diminished, but, rather, very frequently heightened; and\r\nfrequent sexual relations weaken them and hasten the progress of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nAs to pregnancy, that has an extremely pernicious effect on the course\r\nof tuberculosis, and no tuberculous woman should ever marry. If such a\r\none does marry or if the disease develops after her getting married,\r\nmeans should be given her to prevent her from having children. During\r\nthe pregnancy, the disease may not seem to be making any\r\nprogress--occasionally the patient may even seem to improve--but after\r\nchildbirth the disease makes very rapid strides and the patient may\r\nquickly succumb. In the early days of my practice I saw a number of\r\nsuch cases. If precautions are taken against pregnancy, then\r\npermission to indulge in sexual relations may be given, provided it is\r\ndone rarely and moderately.\r\n\r\nIf a patient who has tuberculosis conceals the fact from the future\r\npartner, a fraud is committed, and the marriage is morally annullable.\r\nIt has been declared legally annullable by a recent decision of a New\r\nYork judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Heart Disease=\r\n\r\nHeart disease also is no longer considered hereditary. Nevertheless,\r\nheart disease, if at all serious, is a contraindication to marriage.\r\nFirst, because the patient's life may be cut off at any time. Second,\r\nsexual intercourse is injurious for people having heart disease; it\r\nmay aggravate the disease or even cause sudden death. It is more\r\ninjurious even than it is in tuberculosis. Third--and this concerns\r\nthe woman only--pregnancy has a _very_ detrimental effect upon a\r\ndiseased heart. A heart that, with proper care, might be able to do\r\nits work for years, often is suddenly snapped by the extra work put\r\nupon it by pregnancy and childbirth. Sometimes a woman with a diseased\r\nheart will keep up to the last minute of the delivery of the child and\r\nthen suddenly will gasp and expire. In the first year of my practice I\r\nsaw such a case, and I never have wanted to see another. Women\r\nsuffering from heart disease of any serious character should not,\r\nunder any circumstance, be permitted to become pregnant.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cancer=\r\n\r\nNo man will knowingly marry a woman, and no woman will marry a man,\r\nafflicted with cancer. However, this question often comes up in cases\r\nwhere the matrimonial candidates are free from cancer, but where there\r\nhas been cancer in the family.\r\n\r\nCancer is not a hereditary disease, contrary to the opinions that have\r\nprevailed, and, if the matrimonial candidate otherwise is healthy, no\r\nhesitation need be felt on the score of heredity. The fear of\r\nhereditary transmission of the disease has caused a great deal of\r\nmischief and unnecessary anxiety to people. Scientifically conducted\r\ninvestigations and carefully prepared statistics have shown that many\r\ndiseases formerly considered hereditary are not hereditary in the\r\nleast degree.\r\n\r\nShould it, however, be shown that in one family there were _many_\r\nmembers who died of cancer, it would indicate that there is some\r\ndisease or dyscrasia in that family, and the contracting of a marriage\r\nwith any member of that family would be inadvisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Exophthalmic Goiter= (=Basedow's Disease=)\r\n\r\nExophthalmic goiter is a disease characterised by enlargement of the\r\nthyroid gland, protrusion of the eyeballs, and rapid beating of the\r\nheart. The disease is confined almost entirely, though not\r\nexclusively, to women, and I should not advise any exophthalmic woman\r\nto marry; neither should I advise a man to marry an exophthalmic\r\ngoiter woman. It is a very annoying disease, while sexual intercourse\r\naggravates all the symptoms, particularly the palpitation of the\r\nheart. The children, if not affected by exophthalmic goiter, are\r\nliable to be very neurotic.\r\n\r\n_Simple goiter_, that is, enlargement of the thyroid gland (chiefly\r\noccurring in certain high mountainous localities, such as\r\nSwitzerland), is not so strongly dysgenic as is exophthalmic goiter.\r\nStill, goiter patients are not good matrimonial risks.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are always exceptions. I know an exophthalmic goiter\r\nwoman who brought up four children, and very good, healthy children\r\nthey are. But in writing we can only speak of the average and not of\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Obesity=\r\n\r\nObesity, or excessive stoutness, is an undue development of fat\r\nthroughout the body. That it is hereditary, that it runs in families,\r\nthere is no question whatsoever. And, while with great care as to the\r\ndiet and by proper exercise, obesity may, as a rule, be avoided in\r\nthose predisposed, it none the less often will develop in spite of all\r\nmeasures taken against it. Some very obese people eat only one-half or\r\nless of what many thin people do; but in the former, everything seems\r\nto run to fat.\r\n\r\nObesity must be considered a dysgenic factor. The obese are subject to\r\nheart disease, asthma, apoplexy, gallstones, gout, diabetes,\r\nconstipation; they withstand pneumonia and acute infectious diseases\r\npoorly, and they are bad risks when they have to undergo major\r\nsurgical operations. They also, as a rule, are readily fatigued by\r\nphysical and mental work. (As to the latter, there are remarkable\r\nexceptions. Some very obese people can turn out a great amount of\r\nwork, and are almost indefatigable in their constant activity.) Each\r\ncase should be considered individually, and with reference to the\r\nrespective family history. If the obese person comes from a healthy,\r\nlong lived family and shows no circulatory disturbances, no strong\r\nobjections can be raised to him or to her. But, as a general\r\nproposition, it must be laid down that obesity is a dysgenic factor.\r\n\r\nBut bear in mind that obesity and stoutness are not synonymous terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Arteriosclerosis=\r\n\r\nArteriosclerosis means hardening of the arteries. All men over fifty\r\nare beginning to develop some degree of arteriosclerosis; but, if the\r\nprocess is very gradual, it may be considered normal and is not a\r\ndanger to life; when, however, it develops rapidly and the blood\r\npressure is of a high degree, there is danger of apoplexy.\r\nConsequently, arteriosclerosis and high blood pressure must be\r\nconsidered decided bars to marriage.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the sexual act is, in itself, a danger\r\nto arteriosclerotics and people with high blood pressure, because it\r\nmay bring about rupture of a blood-vessel. There are many cases of\r\nsudden death from this cause of which the public naturally never\r\nlearns. Married persons who find that they have arteriosclerosis or\r\nhigh blood pressure should abstain from sexual relations altogether or\r\nindulge only at rare intervals and moderately.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gout=\r\n\r\nA consideration of gout in connection with the question of heredity\r\nwill show how near-sighted people can be, how they can go on believing\r\na certain thing for centuries without analyzing, until somebody\r\nsuddenly shows them the absurdity of the thing. Gout was always\r\nconsidered a typical hereditary disease; for it was seen in the\r\ngrandfathers, fathers, children, grandchildren, and so on. So,\r\ncertainly, it must be hereditary! It did not come to our doctors'\r\nminds to think that perhaps, after all, it was not heredity that was\r\nto blame, but simply that _the same conditions_ that produced gout in\r\nthe ancestors likewise produced it in their descendants.\r\n\r\nWe know now that gout is caused by excessive eating, excessive\r\ndrinking, lack of exercise, and faulty elimination. And, since, as a\r\ngeneral thing, children lead the same lives that their fathers did,\r\nthey are likely to develop the same diseases as their fathers did. A\r\npoor man who leads an abstemious life doesn't develop gout, and if his\r\nchildren lead the same abstemious lives they do not develop gout.\r\n(There are some cases of gout among the poor, but they are very rare.)\r\nBut if they should begin to gorge and live an improper life they would\r\nbe prone to develop the disease.\r\n\r\nThe disease, therefore, cannot in any way be considered hereditary. In\r\nmatrimony, gout in either of the couple is not a desirable quality,\r\nbut it is not a bar to marriage; and, if the candidate individually is\r\nhealthy and free from gout, the fact that there was gout in the\r\nancestry should play no role.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mumps=\r\n\r\nMumps is the common name for what is technically called parotitis (or\r\nparotiditis). Parotitis is an inflammation of the parotid glands. The\r\nparotid glands are situated, one on each side, immediately in front\r\nand below the external ear, and they are between one-half and one\r\nounce in weight. They belong to the salivary glands; that is, they\r\nmanufacture saliva, and each parotid gland has a duct through which it\r\npours the saliva into the mouth. These ducts open opposite the second\r\nupper molar teeth.\r\n\r\nWe might be surprised to be told that these parotid glands can have\r\nanything to do with the sex organs, but there is no other remote organ\r\nthat has such a close and rather mysterious relationship with the\r\nsex-glands as have the parotids. When the parotid glands, either one\r\nor both, are inflamed, the testicles or ovaries are also liable to be\r\nattacked by inflammation. The inflammation of the testicles may be so\r\nsevere as to cause them to shrivel and dry up; or, even when no\r\nshrivelling, no atrophy of the testicles occurs, they may be so\r\naffected as to become incapable of producing spermatozoa. Moreover, in\r\ncases where the testicles of a mumps patient seemingly were not\r\nattacked--that is, where the patient was not aware of any\r\ninflammation, having no pain and no other symptoms--the testicles may\r\nhave become incapable of generating spermatozoa.\r\n\r\nBesides the testicles, the prostate gland, the secretion of which is\r\nnecessary to the fertility of the spermatozoa, may also become\r\naffected and _atrophied_.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, a very common thing for men who had the mumps in\r\ntheir childhood to be found sterile.\r\n\r\nAs to the sexual power of mumps patients, that differs. Some patients\r\nlose their virility entirely; others remain potent, but become\r\nsterile.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happens to girls attacked by mumps. They may have a\r\nsevere inflammation of the ovaries (ovaritis or ooephoritis) or the\r\ninflammation may be so mild as to escape notice. In either case, the\r\ngirl when grown to womanhood may find herself sterile.\r\n\r\nA man who never had any venereal disease, but who has had mumps,\r\nshould have himself examined for sterility before he gets married. As\r\nexplained in the chapter \"Marriage and Gonorrhea,\" we can, in the\r\ncase of a man, easily find out whether he is fertile or sterile. But,\r\nin the case of a woman, we can not. Time, necessarily, has to answer\r\nthat question. In all cases, mumps reduces the chances of fertility,\r\nand no man or woman who once had mumps should get married without\r\ninforming the respective partner of the fact. There should be no\r\nconcealment before marriage. When the partners to the marriage\r\ncontract know of the facts, they can then decide as to whether or not\r\nthe marriage is desirable to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hemophilia, or Bleeders' Disease=\r\n\r\nHemophilia is a peculiar disease, consisting in frequent and often\r\nuncontrollable hemorrhages. The least cut or the pulling of a tooth\r\nmay cause a severe or even dangerous hemorrhage. The slightest blow,\r\nsqueeze or hurt will cause _ecchymoses_, or discolorations of the\r\nskin. The peculiarity of this hereditary disease is, that it attacks\r\nalmost exclusively the males, but is transmitted almost exclusively\r\nthrough the female members. For instance, Miss A., herself _not_ a\r\nbleeder, comes from a bleeder-family. She marries and has three boys\r\nand three girls; the three boys will be bleeders, the three girls will\r\nnot; the three boys marry and have children; their children will\r\n_not_ be bleeders; the three girls marry, and _their male_ children\r\nwill be bleeders.\r\n\r\nWhat is the lesson? The lesson is, that boys who are bleeders may\r\nmarry, because they will most likely _not_ transmit the disease; but\r\ngirls who come from a hemophilic family, irrespective of whether they\r\nthemselves are hemophilics or not, must not marry, because most likely\r\nthey _will_ transmit the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Anemia=\r\n\r\nAnemia is a poor condition of the blood. The blood may contain an\r\ninsufficient number of red blood cells or an insufficient percentage\r\nof the coloring matter of the blood, that is, hemoglobin. A special\r\nkind of anemia affecting young girls is called chlorosis.\r\n\r\nAnemia and chlorosis cannot be considered contra-indications to\r\nmarriage, because they are usually amenable to treatment. In fact,\r\nsome cases of anemia and chlorosis are due to the lack of normal\r\nsexual relations, and the subjects get well very soon after marriage.\r\nBut it is best and safest to subject anemic patients to a course of\r\ntreatment and to improve their condition before they marry.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Epilepsy=\r\n\r\nWhile epilepsy--known commonly as fits or falling sickness--is not as\r\nhereditary as it was one time thought to be, its hereditary character\r\nbeing ascertainable in only about 5 per cent. of cases, nevertheless,\r\nit is a decidedly dysgenic agent, and marriage with an epileptic is\r\ndistinctly advised against. Where both parents are epileptics, the\r\nchildren are almost sure to be epileptic, and such a marriage should\r\nbe prohibited by law. Under no circumstances should parents who are\r\nboth epileptic bring children into the world. It should be the duty of\r\nthe State to instruct them in methods of preventing conception.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hysteria=\r\n\r\nHysteria is a disease the chief characteristics of which are a _lack\r\nof control_ over one's emotions and acts, the _imitation_ of the\r\nsymptoms of various diseases, and an _exaggerated_ self-consciousness.\r\nThe patient may have extreme pain in the region of the head, ovaries,\r\nspine; in some parts of the skin there is extreme hypersensitiveness\r\n(hyperesthesia), so that the least touch causes great pain; in others,\r\nthere is complete anesthesia--that is, absence of sensation--so that\r\nwhen you stick the patient with a needle she will not feel it. A very\r\nfrequent symptom is a choking sensation, as if a ball came up the\r\nthroat and stuck there (globus hystericus). Then there may be spasms,\r\nconvulsions, retention of urine, paralysis, aphonia (loss of voice),\r\nblindness, and a lot more. There is hardly a functional or organic\r\nnervous disorder that hysteria may not simulate.\r\n\r\nOf late years our ideas about hysteria have undergone a radical\r\nchange, and we now know that most, if not all, cases of hysteria are\r\ndue to a repression or non-satisfaction of the sexual instinct or to\r\nsome shock of a sexual character in childhood. Only too often a girl\r\nwho was very hysterical before marriage loses her hysteria as if by\r\nmagic upon contracting a _satisfactory_ marriage. On the other hand, a\r\nhealthy girl can become quickly hysterical if she marries a man who is\r\nsexually impotent or who is disagreeable to her and incapable of\r\nsatisfying her sexually.\r\n\r\nWhile hysteria, in itself, is not hereditary, it, nevertheless, is a\r\nquestion whether a strongly hysterical woman would make a satisfactory\r\nmother. The entire family history should be investigated. If the\r\nhysteria is found to be an isolated instance in the given girl, it may\r\nbe disregarded, if not extreme; but if the entire family or several\r\nmembers of it are neuropathic, the condition is a dysgenic one.\r\nMarriage may be contracted, provided no children are brought into the\r\nworld until several years have elapsed and the mother's organization\r\nseems to have become more stable. In some cases, a child acts as a\r\ngood medicine against hysteria. In short, every case must be examined\r\nindividually on its merits, and the counsel of a good psychologist or\r\npsychoanalyst may prove very valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Alcoholism=\r\n\r\nA good deal depends upon what we understand by alcoholism. The\r\nfanatics consider a person an alcoholic who drinks a glass of beer or\r\nwine with his meals. This is nonsense. This is not alcoholism, and\r\ncannot be considered a dysgenic factor. But, where there is a distinct\r\nhabit, so that the individual _must_ have his alcohol daily, or if he\r\ngoes on an occasional drunken \"spree,\" marriage must be advised\r\nagainst. And where the man (or woman) is what we call a real drunkard,\r\nmarriage not only should be advised against, but most decidedly should\r\nbe prohibited by law.\r\n\r\nAlcoholism, as a habit, is one of the worst dysgenic factors to reckon\r\nwith. First, the offspring is liable to be affected, which is\r\nsufficient in itself to condemn marriage with an alcoholic. Second,\r\nthe earning powers of an alcoholic are generally diminished, and are\r\nlikely gradually to diminish more and more. Third, an alcoholic is\r\nirritable, quarrelsome, and is liable to do bodily injury to his wife.\r\nFourth an alcoholic often develops sexual weakness or complete sexual\r\nimpotence. Fifth, alcoholics are likely to develop extreme jealousy,\r\nwhich may become pathological, even to the extent of a psychosis.\r\n\r\nIf both the husband and wife are alcoholics, then marriage between\r\nthem which results in children is not merely a sin, but a crime.\r\n\r\nWe do not now come across cases so often as we used to of women\r\nmarrying drunkards in the hope or with the hope of reforming them. But\r\nsuch cases still happen. This is a very foolish procedure. Let the man\r\nreform first, let him stay reformed for two or three years, and then\r\nthe woman may take the chance, if she wants to.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Feeblemindedness=\r\n\r\nFeeblemindedness, in all its gradations--including idiocy, imbecility,\r\nmoronism, and so on--is strongly hereditary and is one of the most\r\ndysgenic factors we have to deal with. It is the most dysgenic of all\r\nfactors. It is more dysgenic than insanity. Marriage with a\r\nfeebleminded person not only should be advised against, but should be\r\nprohibited by law. A feebleminded man has much fewer chances for\r\nmarriage than has a feebleminded woman. Feebleminded girls, even to\r\nthe extent of being morons, if pretty (as they often are) have very\r\ngood chances of getting married, not infrequently getting for husbands\r\nyoung men of good families who themselves of course are not very\r\nstrong mentally, but still are far from being considered feebleminded.\r\n\r\nThere are many cases of brilliant men--more than the public has any\r\nidea of--who married pretty, shy, demure, but withal feebleminded,\r\ngirls, and the result has been in the largest percentage of cases very\r\ndisastrous. In many cases all the children are feebleminded, or if not\r\nfeebleminded, so weak mentally that it is impossible to make them go\r\nthrough any college or school. All the private tutoring is often in\r\nvain. And the brilliant father's heart breaks. It must be borne in\r\nmind that feeblemindedness or weak mentality is much more difficult to\r\ndetect in a woman than it is in a man. Weakmindedness in a woman often\r\npasses for \"cuteness,\" and as among the conservatives a woman is not\r\nexpected to be able to discuss current topics, her intellectual\r\ncaliber is often not discovered by the blinded husband until some\r\nweeks after the marriage ceremony.\r\n\r\nAs any instruction in the use of contraceptives would be wasted on the\r\nfeebleminded, the only way to guard the race against pollution with\r\nfeebleminded stock is either to segregate or to sterilize them.\r\nSociety could have no objection against the feebleminded marrying or\r\nindulging in sexual relations, provided it could be assured that they\r\nwill not bring any feebleminded stock into the world. After the man\r\nand the woman have been sterilized there is no objection to their\r\ngetting married.\r\n\r\nWhere a normal, able or brilliant husband finds out too late that his\r\nwife's mentality is of rather a low order he is certainly justified in\r\nusing contraceptives; and if he is determined to have children he will\r\nbe obliged to divorce his wife. Of course this applies also to the\r\nwife of a weak minded husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Insanity=\r\n\r\nInsanity may be briefly defined as a disease of the mind. We will not\r\nhere go into a discussion as to what constitutes real insanity, as to\r\nwhat is understood by insanity in the legal sense of the term, and so\r\non, except to note that we have two divisions.\r\n\r\nOne is functional insanity. This may be temporary, or periodical, and\r\nis due to some external cause, is curable, and is not hereditary. For\r\ninstance, a person may get insane from a severe shock, from trouble,\r\nfrom anxiety, from a severe accident (such as a shipwreck), from a\r\nsudden and total loss of his fortune, of his wife and children (by\r\nfire, earthquake, shipwreck or railroad accident). Such insanities are\r\ncurable and are not transmissible. Another example is what is known as\r\npuerperal insanity. Some women during childbirth, due probably to some\r\ntoxic infection, become insane. This insanity may be extreme and\r\nmaniacal in character. Still, it often passes away in a few days\r\n_without leaving any trace_ and may never return again, or, if it does\r\nreturn, it may return only during another childbirth. This kind of\r\ninsanity is not transmissible.\r\n\r\nThe second division is what we call organic insanity. This expresses\r\nitself in mania and melancholy, so-called manic-depressive insanity.\r\nThis is due to a degeneration of the brain-and nerve-tissue and is\r\nhereditary.\r\n\r\nBut, our entire conception as to the hereditary transmissibility of\r\ninsanity has undergone a radical change. There is hardly another\r\ndisease the fear of whose hereditary character is responsible for so\r\nmuch anguish and torture. In former years, when there was an insane\r\nuncle or aunt or grandparent that fact weighed like a veritable\r\nincubus on the entire family. Every member of the family was tortured\r\nby the secret anguish that maybe he or she would be next to be\r\naffected by this most horrible of all diseases--disease of the mind.\r\nIf an ancestral member of the family became insane at a certain age,\r\nevery member of that family was living in fear and trembling until\r\nseveral years had passed _after_ that critical age, and only then\r\nwould they begin to breathe freely. Indeed, many people became insane\r\nfrom the very fear of becoming insane. It cannot be subject to any\r\ndoubt that many people do become mentally unbalanced from the fear\r\nthat they will become unbalanced. Fear has a tremendous influence on\r\nthe purely bodily functions, but its influence on the mental functions\r\nis incomparably greater, and a person will often get that which he\r\nfears he is going to get.\r\n\r\nNow the hereditary character of insanity is not taken in the same\r\nabsolute sense in which it was formerly. While we still consider it a\r\ndysgenic factor, yet we recognize the paramount importance of\r\nenvironment; and we know that by proper bringing-up, using the\r\nexpression bringing-up in its broadest sense--including a proper\r\nmental and physical discipline--any hereditary taint can be\r\ncounteracted. In connection with this subject, the following very\r\nrecent statistics will prove of interest.\r\n\r\nThe families of 558 insane persons cared for in the London county\r\nasylums were investigated, and, according to reports received from\r\nthe educational authorities, only 15 of these (less than 3 per cent)\r\nhad mentally defective children. As to the time of the birth of the\r\nchildren, whether before or after the attack of the insanity, we find\r\nthe following figures: 56 out of 573 parents had children after their\r\nfirst attack of insanity, and 106 children were born after the onset\r\nof insanity in the parent; while the remaining 1259 children were born\r\nbefore the parent became insane.\r\n\r\nAltogether, as will be seen from a discussion of the various factors\r\nrendering marriage permissible or nonpermissible, I am inclined to\r\nconsider environment a more important factor than heredity. The purely\r\nphysical characteristics bear the indelible impress of heredity. But\r\nthe moral and cultural characteristics, which in the modern civilized\r\nman are much more important than the physical, are almost exclusively\r\nthe results of environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Neuroses--Neurasthenia--Psychasthenia--Neuropathy--Psychopathy=\r\n\r\nI will not attempt either exhaustive or concise definitions of the\r\nterms named in the caption, for the simple reason that it is\r\nimpossible to give satisfactory definitions of them. The conditions\r\nwhich these terms designate do not constitute definite disease-entities,\r\nand many different things are understood by different people when these\r\nterms are mentioned. Only brief indications of the meaning will be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nNeurosis is a functional disease of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nNeurasthenia is a condition of nervous exhaustion, brought about by\r\nvarious causes, such as overwork, worry, fright, sexual excesses,\r\nsexual abstinence, and so on. The basis of neurasthenia, however, is\r\noften or even generally a hereditary taint, a nervous weakness\r\ninherited from the parents.\r\n\r\nPsychasthenia is a neurosis or psychoneurosis similar to neurasthenia,\r\ncharacterized by an exhaustion of the nervous system, also by weakness\r\nof the will, overscrupulousness, fear, and a feeling of the\r\n_unreality_ of things.\r\n\r\nNeuropathy is a disease or disorder of the nervous system. Psychopathy\r\nis a disease or disorder of the mind.\r\n\r\nOf late years we often hear people referred to as neurotics,\r\nneurasthenics, psychasthenics, neuropaths or psychopaths. These are\r\nundoubtedly abnormal conditions, and, taken as a general thing, they\r\nare dysgenic factors.\r\n\r\nBut a dysgenic factor in an animal _is_ a dysgenic factor, and that\r\nis all there is to it. There are no two sides to the question. But if\r\nanything goes to show the difference between animals and human beings,\r\nand to demonstrate why principles of eugenics, as derived from a study\r\nof animals, can never be _fully_ applicable to human beings, it is\r\nthese considerations which we now have under discussion. To repeat,\r\nneuroses, neurasthenia, psychasthenia, and the various forms of\r\nneuropathy and psychopathy are dysgenic factors. But people suffering\r\nfrom these conditions often are among _the world's greatest geniuses_,\r\nhave done some of the world's greatest work, and, if we prevented or\r\ndiscouraged marriage among people who are somewhat \"abnormal\" or\r\n\"queer,\" we should deprive the world of some of its greatest men and\r\nwomen. For insanity is allied to genius, and if we were to exterminate\r\nall mentally or nervously abnormal people we should at the same time\r\nexterminate some of the men and women that have made life worth\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nAnd what is true of mentally abnormal is also true of physically\r\ninferior people. An inferior horse or dog _is_ inferior. There is no\r\ncompensation for the inferiority. But a man may be physically\r\ninferior, he may be, for instance, a consumptive, but still he may\r\nhave given to the world some of the sweetest and most wonderful poems.\r\nA man may be lame, or deaf, or strabismic, he may be a hunchback or a\r\ncripple and altogether physically repulsive, and yet he may be one of\r\nthe world's greatest philosophers or mathematicians. A man may be\r\nsexually impotent and absolutely useless for race purposes, yet may be\r\none of the world's greatest singers or greatest discoverers.\r\n\r\nIn short, the eugenic problem in the human is not, and never will be,\r\nas simple as it is in the animal and vegetable kingdoms. If we want to\r\nstrive after healthy, normal mediocrity, then the principles of animal\r\neugenics become applicable to the human race. If, on the other hand,\r\nwe want talent, if we want genius, if we want benefactors of the human\r\nrace, then we must go very slow with our eugenic applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Drug Addiction or Narcotism=\r\n\r\nAddiction to drugs, whether it be opium, morphine, heroin or cocaine,\r\nis a strongly dysgenic factor. The addiction to the drug is of itself\r\nnot transmissible, but the weakened constitution or degeneracy which\r\nis generally responsible for the development of the drug addiction is\r\ninheritable.\r\n\r\nA few cases of drug addiction are external; that is, the patient may\r\nhave a good healthy constitution, no hereditary taint, and still\r\nbecause during some sickness he was given morphine a number of times\r\nhe may have developed an addiction to the drug. But those cases are\r\nrare. And such cases, if they are cured and if the addiction is\r\ncompletely overcome, may marry.\r\n\r\nBut in most cases it isn't the drug addiction that causes the\r\ndegeneracy; it is the degeneracy or the neuropathic or psychopathic\r\nconstitution that causes the drug addiction. And such cases are bad\r\nmatrimonial risks.\r\n\r\nAnd it is a very risky thing for a woman to marry an addict with the\r\nidea of reforming him. As I said about the alcoholic: Let him reform\r\nfirst, let him stay reformed for a few years, and then the rest is not\r\nso great.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Consanguineous Marriages=\r\n\r\nConsanguinity means blood relationship, and consanguineous marriages\r\nare marriages between near blood relatives. The physician is\r\nfrequently consulted as to the permissibility or danger of marriages\r\nbetween near relations. The question generally concerns first cousins,\r\nsecond cousins, uncle and niece, and nephew and aunt.\r\n\r\nThe popular idea is that consanguineous marriages are bad _per se_.\r\nThe children of near relatives, such as first cousins, are apt to be\r\ndefective, deaf and dumb, blind, or feebleminded, and what not. This\r\npopular idea, as so many popular ideas are, is wrong. And still there\r\nis of course, as there always is, some foundation for it. The matter,\r\nhowever, is quite simple.\r\n\r\nWe know that many traits, good and bad, are transmitted by heredity.\r\nAnd naturally when traits are possessed by both father and mother they\r\nstand a much greater chance of being transmitted to the offspring than\r\nif possessed by one of the parents alone. Now then, if a certain bad\r\ntrait, such as epilepsy or insanity, is present in a family that trait\r\nis present in both cousins, and the likelihood of children from such a\r\nmarriage inheriting that trait is much greater than when the parents\r\nare strangers, the taint being present in the family of only one of\r\nthe parents. But if there be no hereditary taint in the cousins'\r\nfamily, and, still more, if the family is an intelligent one, if there\r\nare geniuses in the family, then there cannot be the slightest\r\nobjection to marriage between cousins, and the children of such\r\nmarriages are apt to inherit in a strong degree the talents or genius\r\nof their ancestors. In short, if the family is a bad one, one below\r\npar, then marriage between cousins or between uncle and niece should\r\nbe forbidden. If the family is a good one, above par, then marriage\r\nbetween relatives of that family should be encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe idea that the children from consanguineous marriages are apt to be\r\ndeaf and dumb has no foundation in fact. Recent statistics from\r\nvarious asylums in Germany, for instance, have shown that only about\r\nfive per cent. of the deaf and dumb children were the offspring of\r\nconsanguineous marriages. If 95 per cent, of the deaf and dumb had\r\n_non_-consanguineous parents, how could one say that even in the other\r\nfive per cent, the consanguinity was the cause? If it were the other\r\nway around, then of course we could blame consanguinity. As it is, we\r\ncan assume even in this five per cent, a mere coincidence, and we have\r\nno right to say that consanguinity and deaf and dumbness stand in the\r\nrelation to each other of cause and effect.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know that among the Egyptians, Persians, and\r\nIncas of Peru close consanguineous marriages were very common. The\r\nEgyptian kings generally married their sisters. This was common custom\r\nand if the children born of such unions were defectives or\r\nmonstrosities the fact would have become quickly apparent and the\r\ncustom would have been abolished. Evidently the offspring of very\r\nclose consanguinity was normal, or even above normal, or the practice\r\nwould not have been continued such a long time.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps worth while noting that one of the world's greatest\r\nscientists, Charles Darwin, was the child of parents who were first\r\ncousins.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Homosexuality=\r\n\r\nHomosexuality (homos--the same) is a perversion in which a person is\r\nattracted not to persons of the opposite but to persons of the same\r\nsex. Thus a homosexual man does not care for women, but is attracted\r\nto men. A homosexual woman is not attracted to men; she only cares for\r\nwomen and may even loathe men. A homosexual, man or woman, has no\r\nright to marry. The wrong committed by a homosexual marrying is a\r\ndouble one: it is wrong to the partner, wrong to the children. The\r\nnormal partner is bound to discover the abnormality, and if he (or\r\nshe) does, then the married life is a very unhappy one. Even if the\r\nabnormal partner uses the utmost efforts to conceal the abnormality,\r\nhe cannot afford any pleasure to the normal partner, because the\r\nsexual act committed under loathing cannot be satisfactory. The other\r\nwrong is committed on the offspring. Homosexuality is hereditary, and\r\nnobody has a right to bring homosexuals into the world, for there is\r\nno unhappier being than a homosexual. I know a homosexual woman, who,\r\nknowing her abnormality, married for the sake of a comfortable home.\r\nShe has been successful in hiding from her husband her abnormality, he\r\nsimply considering her frigid. But each sexual act costs her tortures.\r\nSo far she has succeeded in avoiding pregnancy. I also know a highly\r\nrefined and educated homosexual gentleman, who married before\r\nunderstanding his condition. Many homosexuals, not knowing that such a\r\nthing as homosexuality even exists, do not understand their own\r\ncondition; they feel a little strange, a little puzzled, but they\r\ndon't know that they ought not to marry. Soon after marrying his\r\ncondition became clear to him, but in the meantime his wife conceived,\r\nand he is now the father of a healthy, good-looking boy. It is\r\npossible that with proper bringing up the development of any\r\nhomosexual traits will be prevented. It should be borne in mind that\r\nlong sexual repression is favorable to the development of\r\nhomosexuality.\r\n\r\nBut to emphasize: homosexuality is a dysgenic factor, and no\r\nhomosexual should marry.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sadism=\r\n\r\nSadism is a sexual perversion in which the person derives pleasure\r\nonly when beating, biting, striking, or otherwise inflicting pain on\r\nthe person of the opposite sex. The degree of cruelty varies, but all\r\nsadists should be shunned. Unfortunately the fact that a man is a\r\nsadist is often not found out until after marriage, but as soon as the\r\nwife has found it out she should leave the man and demand a divorce.\r\nSadism is a sufficient ground for a separation or divorce. No person\r\nwith any moral feeling in him or her should be responsible for\r\nbringing children into the world with a possible sadistic heredity.\r\n\r\nSadistic cruelty is often of the gross, brutal, repulsive kind, but\r\nsometimes the sadist inflicts on his \"beloved\" object refined tortures\r\nof which only a cunning \"demon\" is capable. The sufferings which the\r\nwives of some sadists have to undergo are known only to themselves and\r\nto a few--very few--physicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Masochism=\r\n\r\nMasochism is a sexual perversion in which the person, man or woman,\r\n_likes_ to suffer pain, beatings, insults and other cruelties at the\r\nhands of the beloved object. It is a dysgenic factor but much less\r\nimportant than sadism.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sexual Impotence=\r\n\r\nSexual impotence is not hereditary, but impotence in the male either\r\nso complete that he cannot perform the act or consisting only in\r\npremature ejaculations (relative impotence or sexual insufficiency)\r\nshould constitute a bar to marriage. This impotence may not interfere\r\nwith impregnation; the wife may have children and the children will\r\nnot be in any way defective, but the wife herself, unless she is\r\ncompletely frigid, will suffer the tortures of hell, and may quickly\r\nbecome a sexual neurasthenic, a nervous wreck, or she may even develop\r\na psychosis. Any man suffering with impotence should have himself\r\ntreated before marriage until he is cured; if his impotence is\r\nincurable, then for his own sake and for the sake of the girl or woman\r\nhe is supposed to love he should give up the idea of marriage. The\r\nonly permissible exception is in cases in which the prospective wife\r\nknows the nature of her prospective husband's trouble, and claims that\r\nshe does not care for gross sexual relations and therefore does not\r\nmind the impotence. In case the wife is absolutely _frigid_, the\r\nmarriage may turn out satisfactory. But I would always have my\r\nmisgivings, and should the wife's apparently absent but in reality\r\nonly dormant libido suddenly awaken there would be trouble for both\r\nhusband and wife. It is therefore necessary to emphasize: in all cases\r\nof impotence--caution!\r\n\r\n\r\n=Frigidity=\r\n\r\nFrigidity, as we have explained in a previous chapter, is a term\r\napplied to lack of sexual desire or sexual enjoyment in women. Of\r\ncourse many women before marriage are themselves ignorant of their\r\nsexual condition. Having learned to restrain their impulses, to\r\nrepress any sexual stir, they themselves are often unable to say\r\nwhether they have a strong or weak libido, or any at all. And whether\r\nor no a given woman would derive any pleasure from the sexual act can\r\nonly be found out after marriage. Many girls, however, know very well\r\nwhether they are \"passionate\" or not, but they wouldn't tell. They are\r\nafraid to confess to a complete lack of passion--they fear they might\r\nlose a husband.\r\n\r\nFrigidity as an agent in marriage may be considered from two points of\r\nview: the offspring and the husband. The offspring is not affected by\r\nthe mother's frigidity. A very frigid woman, if the frigidity is not\r\ndue to serious organic causes, may have very healthy children and make\r\nan excellent mother. As far as the husband is concerned, it will\r\ndepend a good deal on the degree of frigidity. If the woman is merely\r\ncold, and, while herself not enjoying the act, raises no objection to\r\nit, then it cannot be considered a bar to marriage. In fact many men,\r\nthemselves not overstrong sexually, are praying for somewhat frigid\r\nwives. (It must be stated, however, that to some husbands relations\r\nwith frigid and non-participating wives are extremely distasteful.)\r\nBut when the frigidity is of such a degree that it amounts to a strong\r\nphysical aversion to the act, it should be considered a bar to\r\nmarriage. Such frigidity is often the cause of a disrupted home, often\r\nleads to divorce and is legally considered a sufficient cause for\r\ndivorce or for the annulment of marriage, the same as impotence in the\r\nman is.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Excessive Libido in Men=\r\n\r\nWe have seen that sexual impotence is a dysgenic factor and if\r\ncomplete and incurable should constitute a barrier to marriage. The\r\nopposite condition is that of excessive libido. Libido is the desire\r\nfor the opposite sex. A proper amount of libido is normal and\r\ndesirable. A lack of libido is abnormal. And an excess of libido is\r\nalso abnormal. But a good many men are possessed of an excess of\r\nlibido; it is either congenital or _acquired_. Some men torture their\r\nwives \"to death,\" not literally but figuratively. Harboring the\r\nprevailing idea that a wife has no rights in this respect, that her\r\nbody is not her own, that she must always hold herself ready to\r\nsatisfy his abnormal desires, such a husband exercises his marital\r\nrights without consideration for the physical condition or the mental\r\nfeelings of his partner. Some husbands demand that their wives satisfy\r\nthem _daily_ from one to five or more times a day. Some wives who\r\nhappen to be possessed of an equally strong libido do not mind these\r\nexcessive demands (though in time they are almost sure to feel the\r\nevil effects), but if the wife possesses only a moderate amount of\r\nsexuality and if she is too weak in body and in will-power to resist\r\nher lord and master's demands, her health is often ruined and she\r\nbecomes a wreck. (Complete abstinence and excessive indulgence often\r\nhave the same evil end-results.) Some men \"kill\" four or five women\r\nbefore the fury of their libido is at last moderated. Of course, it is\r\nhard to find out a man's libido beforehand. But if a delicate girl or\r\na woman of moderate sexuality has reasons to suspect that a man is\r\npossessed of an abnormally excessive libido, she would do well to\r\nthink twice before taking the often irretrievable step.\r\n\r\nI have spoken so far of excessive libido in normal men, that is, in\r\nmen who are otherwise normal, sane and can _whenever necessary_\r\ncontrol their desires. There is a form of excessive libido in men\r\ncalled satyriasis, which reaches such a degree that the men are often\r\nnot able to control their desires, and they will satisfy their\r\npassion even if they know that the result is sure to be a venereal\r\ninfection or several years in prison. Of course, satyriasis is a\r\ndysgenic factor; those suffering with that disorder are not normal;\r\nthey are on the borderland of insanity, and not only should they not\r\nbe permitted to marry, but they should be confined to institutions\r\nwhere they can be subjected to the proper treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Excessive Libido in Women=\r\n\r\nJust as we have impotent and excessively libidinous men, so we have\r\nfrigid and excessively libidinous women. A wife possessed of excessive\r\nlibido is a terrible calamity for a husband of a normal or moderate\r\nsexuality. Many a libidinous wife has driven her husband, especially\r\nif she is young and he is old, to a premature grave. And \"grave\" is\r\nused in the literal, not figurative, sense of the word. It would be a\r\ngood thing if a man could find out the character of his future wife's\r\nlibido before marriage. Unfortunately, it is impossible. At best, it\r\ncan only be guessed at. But a really excessive libido on the part of\r\neither husband or wife should constitute a valid ground for divorce.\r\nWhen the libido in woman is so excessive that she _cannot_ control her\r\npassion, and forgetting religion, morality, modesty, custom and\r\npossible social consequences, she offers herself to every man she\r\nmeets, we use the term nymphomania. It is a disease which corresponds\r\nto satyriasis in men, and what I said of satyriasis applies with equal\r\nforce to nymphomania. Nymphomaniac women should not be permitted to\r\nmarry or to run around loose, but should be confined to institutions\r\nin which they can be subjected to proper treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Harelip=\r\n\r\nThis is a congenital defect consisting in a notch or split in the\r\nupper lip. It is due to defective development of the embryo and is as\r\na rule found in association with cleft palate. Probably hereditary,\r\nbut is not common and is not of much importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Myopia=\r\n\r\nMyopia means nearsightedness. This defect is undoubtedly hereditary to\r\na certain degree, but it is doubtful if, other conditions being\r\nfavorable, any man would give up a girl because she is myopic or vice\r\nversa. Still, if the condition is extreme, as it sometimes is, it\r\nshould be taken into consideration. And where both the man and the\r\nwoman are strongly myopic some hesitation should be felt in\r\ncontracting a marriage. If the husband alone is myopic, then the\r\ndefect may be transmitted to the sons but not to the daughters, and\r\nthese daughters may in their turn transmit the defect to their sons\r\nbut not to their daughters. In other words, the defect is more or less\r\n_sex-limited_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Astigmatism=\r\n\r\nThis is a defect of the eye, depending upon some irregularity of the\r\ncornea or the lens, in which light rays in different meridians are not\r\nbrought to the same focus. It is to a certain extent hereditary, but\r\nplays an insignificant role. It is an undesirable trait, but cannot be\r\nconsidered a dysgenic factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Baldness=\r\n\r\nPremature baldness is a decidedly inheritable trait. And so is\r\npremature grayness of the hair. But it is doubtful if any woman would\r\npermit these factors to play any role in her choice of a husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Criminality=\r\n\r\nAlmost a complete change has taken place in our ideas of criminality,\r\nand there are but very few criminologists now who believe in the\r\nLombrosian nonsense of most criminality being inherited and being\r\naccompanied by physical stigmata of degeneration. The idea that the\r\ncriminal is born and not made is now held only by an insignificant\r\nnumber of thinkers. We know now that by far the greatest percentage\r\nof crime is the result of environment, of poverty, with all that that\r\nword implies, of bad bringing up, of bad companions. We know that the\r\nchild of the criminal, properly brought up, will develop into a model\r\ncitizen, and vice versa, the child of the saint, brought into the\r\nslums, might develop into a criminal.\r\n\r\nThen we must remember that there are many crimes which are not crimes,\r\nper se, but which are merely infractions of man-made laws, or\r\nrepresenting rebellious acts against an unjust and cruel social order.\r\nThus, for instance, a man or a woman who defying the law, would give\r\ninformation about birth control, and be convicted for the offence,\r\nwould be legally a criminal. Morally he or she would be a high-minded\r\nhumanitarian. A man who would throw a bomb at the Russian Czar or at a\r\nmurderous pogrom-inciting Russian Governor would be considered an\r\nassassin, and if caught would be hanged; and in making up the pedigree\r\nof such a family, a narrow-minded eugenist would be apt to say that\r\nthere was criminality in that family. But as a matter of fact, that\r\n\"assassin\" may have belonged to the noblest-minded heroes in history.\r\n\r\nThe eugenists will therefore pay little attention to criminality in\r\nthe ancestry as a dysgenic factor. As long as the matrimonial\r\ncandidate himself is not a criminal, the ancestral criminality should\r\nconstitute no bar to the marriage. It is not likely to show itself\r\natavistically in the children. Altogether a good deal of nonsense has\r\nbeen written about atavism. And people forget that the same rules of\r\nheredity that are applied to physical conditions cannot be applied to\r\nspiritual and moral qualities, the latter being much more dependent\r\nupon environment than the former. Of course the various circumstances\r\nmust be taken into consideration, and each case must be decided upon\r\nits merits. No generalizations can be permitted. The _kind_ of crime\r\nmust always be considered.\r\n\r\nAnd, furthermore, it should be borne in mind that not only is a\r\ncriminal ancestry _per se_ no bar to marriage, the marriage candidate\r\nhimself may be an ex-criminal, may have served time in prison, and\r\nstill be a very desirable father or mother from the eugenic viewpoint.\r\nA man who in a fit of passion or during a quarrel, perhaps under the\r\nslight influence of liquor, struck or killed a man is not, therefore,\r\na real criminal. After serving his time in prison he may never again\r\ncommit the slightest antisocial act, may make a moral citizen and an\r\nideal husband and father.\r\n\r\nThis is not a plea for the under dog. For in this case, where the\r\nfuture of the race is at stake, all other considerations must be put\r\ninto the background. I simply plead for an intelligent consideration\r\nof the subject. Many honored citizens are worse criminals and worse\r\nfathers than many people who have served prison sentences.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pauperism=\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange to discuss pauperism in relation to marriage and\r\nto speak of it as a hereditary factor, but it is necessary to discuss\r\nit, because considerable ignorance prevails on the subject, it being\r\ngenerally confused with poverty. There is a radical difference between\r\npauperism and poverty. People may be poor for generations and\r\ngenerations, even very poor, and still not be considered or classed\r\nwith paupers. Pauperism generally implies a lack of physical and\r\nmental stamina, loss of _self-respect_ and unconquerable laziness. Of\r\ncourse we know now that laziness often rests upon a physical basis,\r\nbeing due to imperfect working of the internal glands. But whatever\r\nthe cause of the laziness may be, the fact is that it is one of the\r\ncharacteristics of the pauper. And while we cannot speak of pauperism\r\nbeing hereditary, the qualities that go to make up the pauper are\r\ntransmissible. No normal woman would marry a pauper, and the woman who\r\nwould marry a pauper is not amenable to any advice or to any book\r\nknowledge. But men are sometimes tempted to marry daughters of paupers\r\nif they happen to be pretty. They should consider the matter very\r\ncarefully, for some of the ancestral traits may become manifest in the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\r\n\r\nBIRTH CONTROL OR THE LIMITATION OF OFFSPRING\r\n\r\n Knowledge of Prevention of Conception Essential--Misapprehensions\r\n  Concerning Birth-control Propaganda--Modern Contraceptives Not\r\n  Injurious to Health--Imperfection of Contraceptive Measures Due\r\n  to Secrecy--Prevention of Conception and Abortion Radically\r\n  Different--More Marriages Consummated if Birth-control\r\n  Information were Legally Obtainable--Demand for Prostitution\r\n  Would be Curtailed--Venereal Disease Due to Lack of\r\n  Knowledge--Another Phase of the Birth-control Problem--Knowledge\r\n  of Contraceptive Methods Where There Was a Taint of Insanity, and\r\n  the Happy Results.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo girl, and no man for that matter, should enter the bonds of\r\nmatrimony without learning the latest means of preventing conception,\r\nof regulating the number of offspring. With people who consider any\r\nattempt at regulating the number of children a sin, we have nothing to\r\nargue, though we believe that there are very few people except among\r\nthe lowest dregs of society who do not use some measures of\r\nregulation. Otherwise we would see most families with ten to twenty\r\nchildren instead of two or three. Nor do I intend to devote this\r\nchapter to a detailed presentation of the arguments in favor of the\r\nrational regulation of offspring. It would have to be merely a\r\nrepetition of the arguments that I have presented elsewhere.[8] But a\r\nfew points may well be touched upon here.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the subject of birth control is much better\r\nknown now than it was when we first started to propagate it, still it\r\ncannot be mentioned too often, for the misapprehensions concerning it\r\nalmost keep pace with the propaganda. First, there is a foolish notion\r\nthat we would try to regulate the number of children forcibly, that we\r\nwould compel people to have a small number of children. Nothing could\r\napparently be more absurd, and still many people sincerely believe it.\r\nNothing is further from the truth. On the contrary, much as we are in\r\nfavor of birth control, we advise limitation of offspring only to\r\nthose who for various reasons, financial, hereditary or hygienic, are\r\nunable to have many children. We emphatically believe that couples who\r\nare in excellent health, who are of untainted heredity, who are fit to\r\nbring up children, and have the means to do so, should have at least\r\nhalf a dozen children. If they should have one dozen, they would\r\ndeserve the thanks of the community. All we claim is that in such an\r\nimportant matter as bringing children into the world, the parents who\r\nhave to carry the full burden of bringing up these children should\r\nhave the right to decide. They should have the means of control. They\r\nshould be able to say whether they will have two or six or one dozen\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Contraceptive Measures=\r\n\r\nAnd the argument that contraceptives are injurious to the health of\r\nthe woman, of the man, or of both, may be curtly dismissed. It is not\r\ntrue of any of the modern contraceptives. But even if it were true,\r\nthe amount of injury that can be done by contraceptives would be like\r\na drop of water in comparison with the injuries resulting from\r\nexcessive pregnancies and childbirths. Some of the contraceptive\r\nmeasures require some trouble to use, some are unesthetic, but these\r\nare trifles and constitute a small price to pay for the privilege of\r\nbeing able to regulate the number of one's offspring according to\r\none's intelligent desires.\r\n\r\nThe commonest argument now made against contraceptives is that they\r\nare not absolutely safe, that is, absolutely to be relied upon, that\r\nthey will not prevent in absolutely every case. This is true; but\r\nthere are three answers which render this objection invalid. First,\r\nmany of the cases of failure are to be ascribed not to the\r\ncontraceptives themselves, but to their improper, careless and\r\nunintelligent use. The best methods in the world will fail if used\r\nimproperly. Second, if the measures are efficient in 98 or 99 per\r\ncent, and fail in one or two per cent., then they are a blessing. Some\r\nwomen would be the happiest women in the world if they could render 98\r\nper cent. of their conjugal relations unfruitful. Third, the\r\nimperfections of our contraceptive measures are due to the secrecy\r\nwith which the entire subject must necessarily be surrounded. If the\r\nsubject of birth control could be fully discussed in medical books\r\nthere is no doubt that in a short time we would have measures that\r\nwould be absolutely certain and would leave nothing to be desired. But\r\neven such as they are, the measures are better than none, and as said\r\nin the beginning of this chapter, it is the duty of every young woman\r\nto acquire as one of the items of her sex education the knowledge of\r\nhow to avoid too frequent pregnancies. In fact, I consider this the\r\nmost important item in a woman's sex education, and if she has learned\r\nnothing else she should learn this. For this information is\r\n_absolutely_ necessary to her future health and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A Few Everyday Cases=\r\n\r\nIn my twenty years' work for the cause of rational birth control I\r\nhave come in contact with thousands and thousands of cases which\r\ndemonstrate in the most convincing manner possible the tragic results\r\nof forced or undesired motherhood, and of the fear of forced or\r\nundesired motherhood.\r\n\r\nSome of the cases were in my own practice, some were related to me by\r\nbrother physicians, some were described to me by the victims living in\r\nall parts of this vast country. Were I to collect and report all the\r\ncases that came to my notice during those twenty years, they would\r\nwithout exaggeration make a volume the size of the latest edition of\r\nthe Standard Dictionary, printed in the same small type. Some of them\r\nare positively heartbreaking. They make you sick at the stupidity of\r\nthe human race, at the stupidity and brutality of the lawgivers. But I\r\ndo not wish to appeal to your emotions. I do not wish to take extreme\r\nand unique cases. I will therefore briefly relate a few everyday\r\ncases, which will demonstrate to you the beneficence of contraceptive\r\nknowledge and the tragedy and misery caused by the lack of such\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n_Case 1._ This class of case is so common that I almost feel like\r\napologizing for referring to it. She, whom I will call by the\r\nforbearing name of Mrs. Smith, had been married a little over nine\r\nyears, and had given birth to five children. She was an excellent\r\nmother, nursed them herself, took good care of them, and all the five\r\nwere living and healthy. But in caring for them and for the household\r\nall alone, for they could not afford a servant or a nurse-girl, all\r\nher vitality had been sapped, all her originally superb energy had\r\ndwindled down to nothing; her nerves were worn to a frazzle and she\r\nbecame but a shadow of her former self. And the fear of another\r\npregnancy became an obsession with her. She dreamed of it at night,\r\nand it poisoned her waking hours in the day. She felt that she simply\r\ncould not go through another pregnancy, another childbirth, with its\r\nsleepless nights and its weary toilsome days. She asked her doctor who\r\nbrought her children into the world to give her some preventive, but\r\nhe laughed the matter off. \"Just be careful,\" was all the advice she\r\ngot from him. And when in spite of being careful, she, horror of\r\nhorrors, became pregnant again, she gathered up courage, went to the\r\nsame doctor, and asked him to perform an abortion on her. But he was a\r\nhighly respectable physician, a Christian gentleman, and he became\r\nhighly indignant at her impudence in coming to him and asking him to\r\ncommit \"murder.\" Her tears and pleadings were in vain. He remained\r\nadamant.\r\n\r\nWhether he would have remained as adamant if instead of Mrs. Smith,\r\nwho could only pay twenty-five dollars for the abortion, the patient\r\nhad been one of his society clientele, who could pay two hundred and\r\nfifty dollars, is a question which I will not answer in the\r\naffirmative or negative. I will leave it open. I will merely remark\r\nthat in the question of abortion in certain specific cases the moral\r\nindignation of some physicians is in inverse proportion to the size of\r\nthe fee expected. A doctor who will become terribly insulted when a\r\npoor woman who can only pay ten or fifteen dollars asks to be relieved\r\nof the fruit of her womb, will usually discover that the woman who can\r\nafford to pay one hundred dollars is badly in need of a curettement.\r\nOh, no. He does not perform an abortion. He merely curets the uterus.\r\n\r\nBut to come back to Mrs. Smith. She went away from the indignant\r\nadamant doctor. But she was determined not to give birth to another\r\nchild. She confided her trouble to a neighbor, who sent her to a\r\nmidwife. The midwife was neither very expert, nor very clean. Mrs.\r\nSmith had to go to her two or three times. After bleeding for about\r\nten days she developed blood poisoning, from which she died a few days\r\nlater, at the early age of twenty-nine, leaving a disconsolate father,\r\nwho in time to come will probably find consolation with another woman,\r\nand five motherless children, who will never find consolation. One\r\nmay find a substitute for a wife, there is no substitute for a mother.\r\n\r\nAnd such tragedies are of daily occurrence. May the Lord have mercy on\r\nthe souls of those who are responsible for them.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed further I wish to say that it is the terrible\r\nprevalence of the abortion evil, with its concomitant evils of\r\ninfection, ill health, chronic invalidism and death, that more than\r\nany other single factor urges us in our birth control propaganda. And\r\nthose who want to forbid the dissemination of any information about\r\nthe prevention of conception are playing directly into the hands of\r\nthe professional abortionists. They could not act any more zealously\r\nif they were in league with the latter and were paid by them. And\r\nhaving mentioned the subject of abortion, I wish to utter a note of\r\nwarning. In our birth control propaganda, we must be very careful to\r\nkeep the question of the prevention of conception and of abortion\r\nseparate and apart. The stupid law puts the two in the same paragraph,\r\nsome ignorant laymen and equally ignorant physicians treat the two as\r\nif they were the same thing, but we, in our speeches and our writings,\r\nmust keep the two separate, we must show the people the essential\r\ndifference between prevention and abortion, between refraining from\r\ncreating life and destroying life already created; we must show the\r\nviciousness of meting out the same punishment for two things which are\r\nfundamentally different, different not only in degree but in kind--and\r\nit is only by thus keeping the two things apart, by showing that we\r\nstand for one thing--prevention--and not for the other--abortion, that\r\nwe can ever gain the general sympathy of the public and the\r\nco-operation of the legislators. I do not say that there are not many\r\ncases in which the induction of abortion is not only justifiable, but\r\nimperative; but that is a different question, and the two issues must\r\nnot be confused. And we would and should resent any attempt on the\r\npart of either enemy or friend to so confuse them.\r\n\r\n_Case 2._ Mr. A. and Miss B. are in love with each other. But they\r\ncannot get married, for his salary is too small. They might risk\r\ngetting married, if the specter of an indefinite number of children\r\ndid not stretch out its restraining hand. She comes from a good\r\nfamily, she was brought up, if not in the lap of luxury, in the lap of\r\ncomfort and coziness, and it is the ambition of every good American to\r\nfurnish his wife at least as good a home as her father gave her. Her\r\nfather, by the way, died prematurely from overwork in trying to give\r\nall possible comforts and advantages to a bevy of six unmarried and\r\nmarriageable daughters.\r\n\r\nAs I said, the fear of children kept them back. Each year the hope\r\nrevived that in another year their union in matrimony would be\r\nconsummated. But the years passed. Mr. A.'s hair became thin and\r\ngrayish, Miss B began to look haggard and pinched--and still the\r\nmarriage could not take place. Miss B was very religious and very\r\nproper, and would not do anything that was improper. A was not quite\r\nso proper; he paid occasional visits elsewhere, and as instruction in\r\nvenereal prophylaxis was not included in his college course, he\r\nacquired a gonorrhea, which it took him about six months to get rid\r\nof. To shorten the story, A was thirty-nine and Miss B was thirty-five\r\nwhen the many times postponed marriage was consummated, but Cupid\r\nseemed to be busy elsewhere when the ceremony took place, and there is\r\nvery little romance in their married life. The marriage has remained\r\nchildless, as I told Mr. A it would be.\r\n\r\nI consider this a ruined life--and all for the lack of a little\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nIf the anti-preventionists, those who are opposed to any information\r\nabout the prevention of conception, were not so hopelessly stupid,\r\nthey would see that from their own point of view it would be better if\r\nsuch information were legally obtainable. For it would be instrumental\r\nin causing more marriages which otherwise remain unconsummated, and\r\nby favoring early marriages, it would be instrumental in curtailing\r\nthe demand for prostitution, in diminishing venereal disease. And as\r\nis well known, venereal disease is one of the great factors in race\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n_Case 3._ A young woman was married to a man who besides being a\r\nbrutal drunkard was subject to periodic fits of insanity. Every year\r\nor two he would be taken to the lunatic asylum for a few weeks or\r\nmonths, and then discharged. And every time on his discharge he would\r\ncelebrate his liberty by impregnating his wife. She hated and loathed\r\nhim, but could not protect herself against his \"embraces.\" And she had\r\nto see herself giving birth to one abnormal child after another. She\r\nbegged her doctor to give her some means of prevention, but that boob\r\nclaimed ignorance, and the illegality of the thing. The woman finally\r\ncommitted suicide, but not before she had given birth to six abnormal\r\nchildren, who will probably grow up drunkards, criminals or insane.\r\n\r\nAnd because we object to such kind of breeding, we are accused of\r\nbeing enemies of the human race, of advocating race suicide, of\r\nviolating the laws of God and man. Oh, for a mighty Sampson to strike\r\nthe imbeciles with the jaw of an ass, for a mental Hercules to loosen\r\nthe fontanelles of their petrified skulls and put some sense into\r\nthem!\r\n\r\n_Case 4._ This observation concerns a couple both of whom had a very\r\nbad heredity. The blood of each was badly tainted. The doctor who had\r\ntreated the husband cautioned them and told them that they had no\r\nright to have children. But here the tables were turned. The doctor\r\nwanted to give them the means for prevention, but the husband and\r\nwife, pious Roman Catholics, would not go against their religion and\r\nGod (as if God wanted a world full of imbeciles), and refused to\r\nemploy any precautions. They have had four children so far. One of\r\nthem seems fairly normal, except that he is silly, in which respect he\r\nis merely like his parents; two are deaf and blind in one eye; the\r\nfourth is a cretin, practically an idiot.\r\n\r\nThis case brings us face to face with another phase of the problem.\r\nWhat should we do when the parents, stupid and ignorant, refuse to\r\nstop breeding worthless material? Eugenic agitation, education, will\r\nbring about such a strong public opinion that none but idiots, who\r\nwill be vasectomized or segregated, will dare to bring into the world\r\nchildren that are physically and mentally handicapped.\r\n\r\n_Case 5._ This couple had been married eight years, and had five\r\nchildren And the wife said she could not stand it any more. Another\r\nchild--no, she preferred death. They practiced coitus interruptus for\r\na while, with mutual disgust, but when the wife was caught again, she\r\nsaid: \"No more!\" And she would not let her husband come near her. He\r\ncould do what he pleased--she did not care. After a few months he\r\nbegan to go elsewhere--contracted syphilis, had to give up his\r\nposition, the home was broken up, the wife went out to work, the\r\nchildren are scattered--in short, a home, which we are told is the\r\nfoundation of our society, is broken up, and there is misery and\r\nwretchedness all around--and all for the lack of a little timely\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n_Case 6._ Mr. A and Miss B, twenty-eight and twenty-five years old\r\nrespectively, have known one another for several years, and in spite\r\nof their occupation, which is supposed to make people blase and\r\ncynical--he being a reporter and she a special story writer--are quite\r\nin love with each other. But their occupation and income are such that\r\nthey cannot possibly afford to have and to bring up any children. They\r\nwould love to get married, but the specter of a child--or rather of\r\nchildren--frightens them; and they remain single, to the great\r\nphysical and mental injury of both. Accidentally they learn of\r\nappropriate means of regulating conception, get married and live\r\nhappily--ever after, that is, until they find themselves in a\r\nposition to have children and to bring them up properly.\r\n\r\nIn what way was society injured by this young couple acquiring\r\ncontraceptive information?\r\n\r\n_Case 7._ Mr. C and Miss D are in love with each other. Unfortunately\r\nthere is a strong hereditary taint of insanity on both sides. They are\r\ntoo high-minded to think of giving birth to children. They might be\r\nall right, but with insanity one does not take any chances. The thing\r\nis too terrible. They are condemned to a life of celibacy, which to\r\nthem means a life of loneliness and misery. But like an angel from\r\nheaven comes to them the knowledge that one can live a love-life\r\nwithout any penalties attached to it. They get married and there is\r\nnot a happier couple living.\r\n\r\nIn what way has society been injured by this couple obtaining the\r\ncontraceptive knowledge?\r\n\r\n_Case 8._ Mr. and Mrs. E have been married five years. They have a\r\nchild four years old which shows unmistakable symptoms of epilepsy.\r\nThey are horrified and an investigation discloses the fact that on her\r\nside in the preceding generation there was a good deal of epilepsy. Of\r\ncourse, the next child may not be epileptic. But then again it may. No\r\nparents with any sense of responsibility would take such chances. They\r\ndecide to give up conjugal relations. They keep it up for about\r\nthirteen or fourteen months; then one night an accident happens and\r\nvery soon she finds herself pregnant. She declares she would rather\r\ndie than to give birth to and have to take care of another epileptic\r\nchild. She goes to a friendly physician who performs an abortion on\r\nher, and now the couple, not secure against future accidents, if they\r\nlive together, decide to separate, and a tragedy is in sight.\r\nFortunately they learn that conception can be prevented, and they\r\ncontinue to live together with benefit to themselves and harm to none.\r\n\r\nIn what way has society been injured by those people acquiring\r\ncontraceptive information?\r\n\r\n_Case 9._ Mr. and Mrs. F have been married six years, and in these six\r\nyears they have been blessed with four children. When he married he\r\nwas getting twenty-two dollars a week, and that is exactly what he is\r\ngetting now. In the meantime the cost of living has gone up\r\ntwenty-five per cent., and there are four extra mouths to feed and\r\nfour extra bodies to clothe. What difference this has made in that\r\nlittle household can better be imagined than stated. The little mother\r\nhas aged sixteen years in those six years, and there is not a trace\r\nleft of her girlishness and youthfulness. She loves her children, and\r\ndoes not want to get rid of them. She would not take a million\r\ndollars for one of them, but she would not give five cents for\r\nanother. But this is just what terrifies them; the possibility of\r\nanother. And that possibility makes her irritable, makes her repel her\r\nhusband's slightest advances, makes her move his bed to another room.\r\nShe even tells him to satisfy his sexual desires elsewhere--and at the\r\nsame time she is in fear and trembling that he might follow her\r\nadvice. In short, a nice young home is about to be disrupted.\r\nFortunately he reads somewhere an article on the subject of voluntary\r\nlimitation of offspring, he begins to investigate; his physician\r\npleads ignorance, but he is persistent, the physician investigates and\r\nobtains the desired information, which he shares with the patient.\r\nHarmony is restored and a happy home is re-established.\r\n\r\nWho was injured by the couple obtaining this information? And if\r\nnobody was injured, and everybody concerned was benefited, then why\r\nshould the imparting of such information be considered a felony,\r\npunishable like the most atrocious of crimes?\r\n\r\n_Case 10._ Mr. and Mrs. G have been married fifteen years. They were\r\nthe parents of seven children, a large enough number for any family.\r\nThose seven children were born during the first eleven years of their\r\nmarried life. During the past five years, afraid of having any more,\r\nthey first abstained and then adopted a method which every modern\r\nsexologist knows is injurious to the nervous system of both the man\r\nand the woman. The man became a wreck; first neurasthenic, then\r\nimpotent, cranky and grouchy, unable to get along in the office,\r\nconstantly squabbling with his wife, who became just as bad a wreck.\r\nTheir economic condition plus too many small children prevented the\r\nparents' separation. They remained living together, but they lived\r\nlike a cat and a dog tied in a bag. Each silently prayed to be rid of\r\nthe other. But a conversation overheard at a Turkish baths\r\nestablishment put him on the right trail, and one year later we find\r\nthe couple reconciled, both in good health and living a peaceful and\r\nfairly harmonious life. And those who have benefited most by the\r\nchange are the children. In what way was society injured? And still if\r\nthe doctor who gave Mr. G the information should have been caught and\r\nconvicted, he would have been sent to prison for a year or two or\r\nfive. Would he have deserved it? Here we have several plain, simple,\r\nunvarnished and unembellished cases which are typical of millions of\r\nsimilar cases and which prove conclusively that the law against\r\nimparting information about preventing conception is brutal, vicious,\r\nantisocial. Should not such a law be repealed, wiped off the statute\r\nbooks?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] The Limitation of Offspring by the Prevention of Conception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\r\n\r\nADVICE TO GIRLS APPROACHING THE THRESHOLD OF WOMANHOOD\r\n\r\n The Irresistible Attraction of the Young Girl for the Male--The\r\n  Unprotected Girl's Temptations--Some Men Who Will Pester the\r\n  Young Girl--Risk of Venereal Infection--Danger of\r\n  Impregnation--Use of Contraceptives by the Unmarried Woman May\r\n  Not Always Be Relied Upon--Nature of Men who Seduce\r\n  Girls--Exceptions--Illegitimate Motherhood--Difficulties in the\r\n  Way of Illegitimate Mother Who Must Earn Her Living--The Child of\r\n  the Foundling Asylum--Social Attitude Towards Illegitimacy\r\n  Responsible for Abortion Evil--Dangers of Abortion--The Girl Who\r\n  Has Lost Her Virginity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a girl has passed the transition period of puberty and is\r\nentering upon young womanhood she exerts an irresistible attraction on\r\nthe male sex. Whether she give the impression of a luscious red rose\r\nor of a delicate white lily, the charms of a beautiful, healthy,\r\nbright girl of seventeen or eighteen are undeniable and their appeal\r\nto the esthetic and sexual sense of every normal male is a normal,\r\n_natural_ phenomenon. Whether it is a good thing or a bad thing that\r\nit is so, we will not stop to discuss here. But it is a natural\r\nphenomenon, a natural law, if you will, and one does not quarrel with\r\nnatural phenomena. It is useless. But the attraction which the girl\r\nexercises on the male is fraught with danger to her, and therefore a\r\nfew words of advice and of warning are not out of place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Temptations.= Fortunate are you, my young girl friend, if you come\r\nfrom a well-sheltered home, if you have been properly brought up, if\r\nyou have a good and wise mother who knows how to take care of you. A\r\nmother's wise counsel given at the proper time, and her comradeship\r\nall the time, are more invulnerable than an armor of bronze and more\r\nsecure than locked doors and barred windows. But if you have lost your\r\nmother at an early age, or if your mother is not of the right sort--it\r\nis no use hiding the fact that some mothers are not what they should\r\nbe--if you have to shift for yourself, if you have to work in a shop,\r\nin an office, and particularly if you live alone and not with your\r\nparents, then temptations in the shape of men, young and old, will\r\nencounter you at every step; they will swarm about you like flies\r\nabout a lump of sugar; they will stick to you like bees to a bunch of\r\nhoneysuckle.\r\n\r\nI do not want you to get the false idea that all men or most men are\r\nbad and mean, and are constantly on the lookout to ruin young girls.\r\nNo. Most men are good and honorable and too conscientious to ruin a\r\nyoung life. But there are some men, young and old, who are devoid of\r\nany conscience, who are so egotistic that their personal pleasure is\r\ntheir only guide of conduct. They will pester you. Some will lyingly\r\nclaim that they are in love with you; some perhaps will sincerely\r\nbelieve that they are in love with you, mistaking a temporary passion\r\nfor the sacred feeling of love. Some will even promise to marry\r\nyou--some making the promise in sincerity, others with the deliberate\r\nintent to deceive. Still others will try to convince you that chastity\r\nis an old superstition, and that there is nothing wrong in sexual\r\nrelations. In short, all ways and means will be employed by those men\r\nto induce you to enter into sexual relations with them.\r\n\r\n_Don't you do it!_\r\n\r\nI am not preaching or sermonizing to you. I am not appealing to your\r\nreligion or your morals. For if you have strong religious or moral\r\nideas against illicit sexual relations, you are not in need of mine or\r\nanybody else's advice. But I assume that you are a more or less modern\r\ngirl, with little or no religious bringing-up, or perhaps a radical\r\ngirl, who has shaken off the shackles of religion and tradition. And\r\nto you I say: _Don't you do it_. Why? Because your welfare, your\r\nfuture happiness, is at stake. I am speaking from the point of view of\r\nyour own good, and from that point of view I say: Resist all attempts\r\nwhich men make exclusively for the purpose of satisfying their sexual\r\ndesire, their lust.\r\n\r\nYou will ask again, why? For several reasons. First, you run the risk\r\nof venereal infection. The danger is not so great now as in former\r\ntimes, but is great enough. There are still plenty of men dishonest\r\nenough to indulge in sexual relations with a woman when they know they\r\nare not radically cured. The same man who will not get married unless\r\nhe is sure that he is perfectly cured will not hesitate to subject a\r\ntransient girl or woman to the risk of venereal infection. I know\r\npersonally, because I have treated them; yes, I treated several\r\nintelligent and radical young men who infected young girls. And some\r\nof these girls in their turn, through ignorance and innocence,\r\ninfected other men. So then, the first danger is the danger of\r\nvenereal infection.\r\n\r\nThe second danger, still greater and more certain than the first, is\r\nthe danger of impregnation. And pregnancy for a girl under our present\r\nmoral and social-economic conditions is a terrible calamity. She is\r\nostracized everywhere, and it means, if discovered, her social death.\r\nBut you will say: \"Aren't there any remedies that can be used to\r\nprevent conception? Aren't you yourself among the world's chief\r\nbirth-controllers; one of the world's chief advocates of the use of\r\ncontraceptives?\" Yes, my dear young lady, but I never made the claim\r\nthat the contraceptives were _absolutely_ infallible, I never claimed\r\nthat they were _100 per cent._ effective in _100 per cent._ of _all_\r\ncases. But if they are effective 999 times or even 990 times in every\r\n1000 they are a blessing. And thousands of families so consider them.\r\nAnd if a married woman gets caught once in a while, the misfortune is\r\nnot so great. But if the accident happens to a non-married woman, the\r\nmisfortune _is_ great. Then again, you want to bear in mind that\r\naccidents are less likely to happen to married than to non-married\r\nwomen. The married woman has no fear, needs no secrecy, and she can go\r\nabout the method of preparation carefully, with deliberation. The\r\nunmarried girl, _as a rule_, has not the proper conveniences, more or\r\nless secrecy must be maintained, hurry is not infrequently necessary,\r\nand that is why accidents are more apt to occur in spite of the use of\r\ncontraceptives. So then, the second danger, even more sinister than\r\nthe first, is the danger of pregnancy. \"But if a misfortune happens,\r\ncan I not have an abortion produced?\" No, not always. Physicians\r\nwilling to induce an abortion are not found on every corner. But this\r\nis not the principal point. What I have to say on the subject, I will\r\nsay later on in this chapter.\r\n\r\nThen it is well for you to bear in mind that those very men who use\r\ntheir utmost efforts, who strain every fibre and every nerve to get\r\nyou, will despise you and detest you as soon as they have succeeded in\r\nmaking you yield to their wishes. This is one of the worst blots on\r\nthe male man's character, a blot from which the female character is\r\nentirely free. And some men--fortunately their number is not very\r\nlarge--are such moral skunks that they take morbid pleasure in\r\nboasting publicly of their sexual conquests, and unscrupulously peddle\r\nabout the name of the girl whom, by cunning false promises or other\r\nmeans, they succeeded in seducing. And of course such a girl finds it\r\ndifficult or impossible to get married, and must end her days in\r\nsolitude, without the hope of a home of her own.\r\n\r\nFor the above reasons I advise you earnestly and sincerely not to\r\nyield to the solicitations of thoughtless or unscrupulous men, who\r\nthink of nothing but their coarse sensual pleasures. It is advice\r\ndictated by common sense, by your own deeper interest, aside from any\r\nreligious or moral considerations.\r\n\r\nThe above advice, or call it sermon if you will, is meant principally\r\nfor young girls, girls between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five.\r\nIf a girl has reached the age of twenty-eight or thirty and is\r\nwilling to enter upon illicit sexual relations with her eyes open,\r\nwith a full knowledge of the possible consequences, then it is her\r\naffair, and nobody shall say her nay. Nobody has a right to interfere.\r\n\r\nNor should my advice be understood as directed to cases where there is\r\nsincere reciprocal affection and a mutual understanding. This is an\r\nentirely different matter, and has nothing to do with cases where the\r\nman is the pursuer or seducer and the woman an unwilling or reluctant\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the relations between the man and the girl may be,\r\nwhether she yielded in a fit of passion, or was seduced by false\r\npromises, by \"moral\" suasion, by hypnotic influence or by the vulgar\r\nmethod of being made drunk, what is she to do if she finds herself, to\r\nher horror, in a pregnant condition? There are two ways open to her:\r\neither let the pregnancy go to term or to have an abortion brought on.\r\n\r\nIf she lets the pregnancy go to term she has the alternative of\r\nbringing up the child herself openly or of placing it secretly in a\r\nfoundling asylum. In the first case, the necessity of publicly\r\nacknowledging illegitimate motherhood requires so much moral courage\r\nthat not one woman in a thousand is equal to it. It is not moral\r\ncourage alone that is required; the social ostracism could be borne\r\nwith stoicism and even with equanimity, if with it were not frequently\r\nassociated the fear or the real danger of starvation. For under our\r\npresent system the illegitimate mother finds many avenues of activity\r\nclosed to her. A school teacher would lose her position instantly, and\r\nso would a woman in any public position. It is feared that her example\r\nmight have a contaminating influence on the children or on her fellow\r\nworkers. Nor could she be a social worker--I know of more than one\r\nwoman who lost her position with social or philanthropic institutions\r\nas soon as it was discovered that she did not live up strictly to the\r\nconventional code of sex morality. Nor could she be a private\r\ngoverness.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that to acknowledge one's self an illegitimate mother\r\nrequires so much courage, so much sacrifice, that very, very few\r\nmothers are now found that are equal to the task. Especially so when\r\nit is taken into consideration that the humiliations and indignities\r\nto which the child is subjected and the later reproaches of the child\r\nitself make the mother's life a veritable hell. So this alternative is\r\ngenerally out of the question.\r\n\r\nTo give the child to a foundling asylum or to a \"baby farm\" means\r\ngenerally to condemn it to a slow death--and not such a slow one,\r\neither. For as statistics show about ninety to ninety-five per cent.\r\nof all babies in those institutions die within a few months. And the\r\nvery few who survive and grow up have not a happy life. Life is hard\r\nenough for anybody; for children who come into the world handicapped\r\nby the disgrace of illegitimacy, life is torture indeed. It is with a\r\nbreaking heart generally and because there is no other way out of the\r\ndilemma that a mother puts her baby away in a foundling asylum. She\r\nhopes and prays for its speedy death.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the pitifully unhappy lot of the\r\nillegitimate mother and illegitimate child, it is no wonder that every\r\nunmarried woman, as soon as she finds herself pregnant, is frantically\r\ndetermined to get rid of the child in the womb as soon as possible.\r\nAnd abortion thrives in every civilized country. Thousands and\r\nthousands of doctors and semi-doctors and midwives are making a rich\r\nliving in this country from practicing abortion. The greater the\r\ndisgrace with which illegitimacy is considered in a country, the\r\nstricter the prohibition against the use of measures for the\r\nprevention of conception, the greater the number of abortions in that\r\ncountry. But abortion is not a trifle, to be undertaken with a light\r\nheart. It is true that if performed by a thoroughly competent\r\nphysician, with all aseptic precautions, it is practically free from\r\ndanger. But when performed by a careless physician or an ignorant\r\nmidwife, trouble is apt to happen. Blood poisoning may set in, and the\r\npatient may be very sick for a time, and may on recovery from the\r\nacute illness remain a chronic invalid for life. And occasionally the\r\npatient dies. Whether or not abortion is justifiable under special\r\ncircumstances is a separate question, which I have discussed in\r\nanother place. But leaving aside the ethics of the question, if you\r\nhave determined to have an abortion produced, be sure to go to a\r\nconscientious physician, and avoid the quacks and midwives. An\r\nunexpected and undesired pregnancy is punishment enough and there is\r\nno reason why you should be further punished by becoming a chronic\r\ninvalid or by paying with your life. There is no sense in it. Nobody\r\nwill profit by your invalidism or your death.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to leave this topic without re-emphasizing the fact that\r\nabortion is not a trifle, to be undertaken or even to be spoken of\r\nlightly. Too many women, not only in the radical ranks, but in the\r\nconservative ranks as well, are in the habit of considering abortion\r\nas a joke, a trifling annoyance, something like a cold in the head,\r\nwhich, while disagreeable, is sure to pass away in a day or two. They\r\nknow Mrs. A and Mrs. B and perhaps Miss C who had abortions produced\r\non them and in two or three days they were as good as ever. Yes. But\r\nthey do not know Miss D who is resting in her grave, nor do they know\r\nwhy Miss E and Mrs. F are invalids for life. The women who get over\r\ntheir abortion experiences easily are apt to talk of their good luck;\r\nthe women who have become chronic invalids or who are resting in their\r\ngraves as a result of an abortion are not apt to talk of the matter.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore, once more, remember, an abortion is no trifling matter.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of advice and I am through. Some men of a low moral and\r\nmental caliber are under the influence of the pernicious idea that if a\r\ngirl has lost her virginity--no matter under what circumstances--she no\r\nlonger amounts to much and is free prey for everybody who may want her.\r\nAnd, like beasts of prey, these wretched specimens of humanity pester\r\nsuch a girl with much more impudence, more brazenness than they dare to\r\nemploy in the case of a girl who is still considered a virgin. And,\r\nwhat is more, the girls themselves become poisoned with this pernicious\r\nidea and dare not offer the same resistance that the virgin does. And\r\nthey often yield with resignation, though against their will, and\r\nthough they may experience a feeling of disgust against the man.\r\n\r\nNow again, _don't you do it_. Do not nurse the medieval idea that\r\nbecause you are not a virgin in the physical sense, you are \"ruined,\"\r\n\"no good,\" and an outcast. You are nothing of the kind. If through\r\nsome cause or other you are no longer in possession of an intact\r\nhymen, it is your affair or misfortune, and nobody else's. Do not on\r\nthat account cast your eyes down and avoid meeting people. Carry your\r\nhead high, do not fear to meet people, and treat with contempt the\r\njeers of the stupid and ignorant. A person's entire character does not\r\ndepend upon the presence or absence of the hymen, and one misstep\r\nshould not ruin a person's whole life. A boy is not \"ruined,\" is not\r\nan outcast, because he has had sexual relations before marriage, and\r\nwhile the boy's and girl's cases are not exactly identical, still the\r\npoor girl should not be made to expiate one error all her life long.\r\n\r\nIt isn't fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR\r\n\r\nADVICE TO PARENTS OF UNFORTUNATE GIRLS\r\n\r\n Attitude of Parents Towards Unfortunate Girl--The Case of Edith\r\n  and What Her Father Did--The Pitiful Cases of Mary B. and Bridget\r\n  C.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuppose you are the parents of a girl to whom a misfortune has\r\nhappened. I admit it is a misfortune, a catastrophe. Probably the\r\ngreatest catastrophe that, under our present social system, can happen\r\nto an unmarried young woman. What are you going to do? Are you going to\r\ndisgrace her--incidentally disgracing yourselves--are you going to kick\r\nher out of the house, condemning her to a suicide's grave, or to a life\r\nthat is often worse than death? Or are you going to stand by her in her\r\ndark hours, to shield her, to surround her with a wall of protection\r\nagainst a cruel and wantonly inquisitive world, and thus earn her\r\neternal gratitude, and put her on the path of self-improvement and\r\nuseful social work? Which shall it be? But before you decide, kindly\r\nbear in mind that your girl is not entirely to blame; that some of the\r\nblame lies with you. If she had been _properly_ brought up, this would\r\nnot have happened. I know such a thing could never have happened in my\r\nhousehold. But I know how I would have acted if such a thing had\r\nhappened. And I will tell you how one father and mother did act under\r\nthe circumstances.\r\n\r\nThey were far from rich; just fairly comfortable; they had a\r\nwell-paying store. Edith was their treasure, because she was so pretty\r\nand so full of life. Unfortunately, she was too pretty and too full of\r\nlife. She was only seventeen, but was fully developed, and had many\r\nempty-headed young admirers, who showered upon her silly compliments\r\nand cloying sweets. She became frivolous and flirtatious and was\r\nbeginning to do poorly in high school. She failed in her last year,\r\nand refused to take the year over again. Now, all the time being her\r\nown, and having nobody to give any account to, she began to go out a\r\ngood deal, and more than ever indulged in flirtations. One night she\r\nstayed out later than usual, her parents were worried, and when she\r\ncame home about two in the morning there was a quarrel, and the\r\nfather, who was a strict, impulsive man, gave her a pretty good\r\nbeating. After that she went out very little, kept to herself, became\r\nrather melancholy, lost her appetite, and did not sleep well. To all\r\ninquiries she answered that there was nothing the matter with her,\r\nthat she just felt a little indisposed. Four or five months thus\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nBut finally the condition could no longer be concealed. The mother was\r\nthe first one to discover it. When the fact dawned upon her\r\nconsciousness that her beautiful, not quite eighteen-year-old Edith\r\nwas pregnant she promptly fell in a faint and it took Edith and the\r\nmaid quite some time to restore her to consciousness. She became\r\ndistracted. She floundered about pitifully, not knowing what to do,\r\nwhat decision to reach. She tried to conceal the matter from the\r\nfather, but he saw that there was something wrong and it didn't take\r\nhim long to worm the truth out of her. As the mother on learning the\r\ntragic truth had taken refuge in a dead faint, so he took refuge in a\r\nBerserker rage. He fumed and stormed and was in danger of an\r\napoplectic stroke. He wanted to strike the daughter, but the mother\r\ninterfered. He then ordered Edith to get out of the house and never to\r\ncross his threshold again. Edith looked at him to see if he meant it;\r\nthe mother tried to intercede; but he was inflexible, and demanded\r\nthat she leave at once. Edith began to gather a few of her belongings,\r\nthe tears silently rolling down her face.\r\n\r\nAnd here a sudden change came over the father. Some men (and women)\r\nare crushed by small misfortunes; real catastrophes awaken their\r\nfiner qualities, which lay dormant within them and which might have\r\nremained dormant within them forever. In these few minutes he seems to\r\nhave undergone a complete metamorphosis. He went up to Edith, took her\r\nin his arms, kissed her, told her to stay, to calm down and they would\r\nsee what could be done. In a few days she was taken over to a\r\nphysician who performed an abortion. She was a pretty sick girl for\r\nabout six weeks, and at one time there was danger of blood poisoning\r\nsetting in. But she recovered. And she was a different girl. She had\r\nshed her frivolity and lightheartedness like an old garment. She took\r\nher last year in high school over again, entered Barnard, from which\r\nshe was graduated among the very first, and soon began to teach in\r\nthat very high school in which she had been a pupil. One of the\r\nteachers fell in love with her and she fell in love with him. He asked\r\nher to marry him. She wanted no skeleton from the past coming down\r\nrattling its bones and marring their married life, and she told him of\r\nthe unfortunate incident. A good test, by the way, to find out a man's\r\nreal love and breadth of character. Fortunately the man's love was a\r\ntrue love, not merely passion, and he was truly broadminded, which is\r\nnot a very common thing among school-teachers. Their married life is\r\nan uncloudedly happy one. And the relation between the daughter and\r\nthe parents is one of sincere love and deep mutual respect.\r\n\r\nIsn't it better so?\r\n\r\nDidn't Edith's parents act more decently, more kindly, more humanely,\r\nmore wisely than the parents, say, of Mary B, who, when they found out\r\nher condition, put her out of the house, into which she was brought\r\nback two days later a corpse, fished out from the East River? Didn't\r\nEdith's father act more nobly, more wisely even from a purely selfish\r\npoint of view than the father of Bridget C, who kicked his daughter\r\nout penniless into the street, where he had to see her afterwards\r\npowdered and painted soliciting men and boys? The mother died of a\r\nbroken heart, and the father, unable to bear the constant, daily\r\nrepeated disgrace, became an incorrigible drunkard.\r\n\r\nFathers and mothers! So bring up your daughters, so guard them and\r\nprotect them, that the misfortune of an illegitimate pregnancy may not\r\nbefall them. But if the misfortune has befallen them, then stand by\r\nthem! Do not desert them then in these dark hours, the darkest hours\r\nin a girl's life. Do not kick them--they are down enough. Stand by\r\nthem, and they will become good women and you will have their eternal\r\ngratitude. If you do not stand by them, you are worse than the beasts\r\nof the jungle and deserve their eternal curse. You are unworthy to be,\r\nor to be called, parents, for you are devoid of the least spark of\r\nthat sacred feeling called Parental Love, a feeling which\r\nunfortunately in only too many parents is replaced by nothing but the\r\nmost sordid, most brutal egotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE\r\n\r\nSEXUAL RELATIONS DURING MENSTRUATION\r\n\r\n Heightened Sexual Appetite of Many Women During\r\n  Menstruation--Sexual Intercourse During Menstrual Period--When\r\n  Intercourse May be Permitted--Injection Before Coitus During\r\n  Menstruation--Fallacy of Ancient Idea of Injuriousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis may seem to some a strange and superfluous question, a question\r\nwhich would never present itself. Still the laity would be surprised\r\nif it learned how frequently nowadays that question is presented to\r\nthe physician who specializes in sex matters. Some husbands come to\r\nthe physician complaining that the menses are the only period during\r\nwhich their wives demand sex relations, and ask if something cannot be\r\ndone to cure them of what they consider an abnormal desire.\r\n\r\nBiologically considered, the desire on the woman's part for sex\r\nrelations during the menses should not seem strange or abnormal, for\r\nwe must bear in mind that menstruation bears a certain analogy to the\r\nrut in animals. And animals permit intercourse at no time except\r\nduring the rut.\r\n\r\nRecent investigations have disclosed to fact that the number of women\r\nwhose sexual appetite is _heightened_ during the time immediately\r\npreceding, during, and following the menses, is quite considerable.\r\nAnd there is also a smaller percentage of women who experience the\r\ndesire _at no other time except_ during the menses.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, relations during the menses should be discouraged.\r\nThere are several reasons for it. The first reason, which need not be\r\ngone into in detail, is an esthetic one. The second reason is that\r\nintercourse during menstruation may in some cases lead to congestion\r\nof the uterus and ovaries. Third, the menstrual discharge, which as we\r\nknow does not consist of pure blood but is a mixture of blood, mucus,\r\nand degenerated lining membrane of the uterus, may give rise to a\r\ncatarrh of the urethra in the man. Fourth, and this is a point to be\r\nborne in mind, any discharge that a woman may be suffering from is\r\nalways aggravated during menstruation. For these reasons relations\r\nduring the menses are undesirable.\r\n\r\nBut where the woman has strong libido during that time and has no\r\nlibido at any other time, relations may be indulged in during the last\r\nday or two of the menses. Any unpleasantness may be obviated and any\r\ndischarge may be removed by the woman taking a mild, warm, antiseptic\r\ninjection before coitus. The ancient idea of the injuriousness of the\r\nrelations during menstruation and the disastrous results likely to\r\nfollow them have only a very slender foundation. They rest on no\r\nscientific basis and though it may be sad to state facts, there are\r\nmany couples who do indulge in such relations as a regular thing and\r\nwithout any injury to either husband or wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SIX\r\n\r\nSEXUAL INTERCOURSE DURING PREGNANCY\r\n\r\n Complete Abstinence During-Pregnancy--Bad Results of Complete\r\n  Abstinence--Intensity of Relations During First Four\r\n  Months--Intercourse During Fifth, Sixth and Seventh\r\n  Months--Intercourse During Eighth and Ninth Months--Abstinence\r\n  After Birth of Child.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question whether sexual intercourse is permissible during\r\npregnancy is often put to the physician. Some extremists and theorists\r\ndemand complete abstinence during the entire duration of pregnancy.\r\nSuch abstinence is not only not feasible, but is unnecessary and may\r\nprove a disrupting factor; it may create not only dissension, it may\r\nwreck the love-life of husband and wife. I know of cases where the\r\nwife, influenced by the wrong teachings about the necessity of\r\ncomplete abstinence during pregnancy, about the possible injury to the\r\nchild from intercourse, persisted in keeping the husband away; and the\r\nresult was that the husband began to go to other women, and he got in\r\nthe habit to such an extent that he refused to give up entirely, even\r\nafter the child was born. It cannot be expected from a married man,\r\nwho is used to more or less regular sexual relations, to abstain\r\nentirely for nine or ten months. Such a demand is unreasonable and\r\nuncalled for. All claims about the injurious effects of intercourse on\r\nthe mother and child lack proof and foundation. During the first four\r\nmonths of pregnancy no change need be made in the usual sex relations.\r\nTheir \"intensity\" should be moderated, their frequency need not.\r\nDuring the fifth, sixth and seventh months intercourse should be\r\nindulged in at rarer intervals--once in two or three weeks--the act\r\nshould be performed without any violence or intensity, and the usual\r\nposition should be reversed or changed to a lateral one. During the\r\neighth and ninth months relations had best be given up altogether.\r\n\r\nAnd this abstinence should last until about six weeks after the birth\r\nof the child. During this period the uterus undergoes what we call\r\ninvolution; that is, it goes back to the size and shape it had before\r\npregnancy, and it is best not to disturb this process by sexual\r\nexcitement, which causes engorgement and congestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN\r\n\r\nSEXUAL INTERCOURSE FOR PROPAGATION ONLY\r\n\r\n Belief in Sexual Intercourse for Propagation Only--What Such\r\n  Practice Would Lead to--Nature and the Sex-fanatics--Sexual\r\n  Desire in Woman After Menopause--Sex Instinct of Sterile Men and\r\n  Women--Sex Instinct Has Other High Purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome people sincerely believe that the sexual instinct is for\r\nreproductive purposes only; they claim we should never indulge in\r\nsexual intercourse unless it be for the purpose of bringing a child\r\ninto the world. The act performed without such aim in view is\r\nstigmatized by them as carnal lust, as a sin. Some even say that such\r\nan act is equivalent to an act of prostitution. To _argue_ the\r\nquestion with such people would be a waste of time. It is not fair to\r\nimpugn the good faith, the sincerity of your opponents, because I have\r\nconvinced myself that the most insane, most bizarre notions may be\r\nheld by otherwise sane people in perfect sincerity. But we cannot help\r\nquestioning the reasoning faculties of people holding such beliefs.\r\n\r\nLet us see where the belief of \"sex relations for procreation only\"\r\nwould lead us to. In a normal healthy couple impregnation follows one\r\nconnection. So if a couple wanted to limit themselves to three or four\r\nor six children, they would be entitled to have relations only three,\r\nfour or six times in their lives. For it must be remembered that\r\nduring pregnancy sexual relations would be prohibited, as during\r\npregnancy no further impregnation can take place, and no intercourse\r\nmust take place which has not for its purpose the conception of a new\r\nhuman being. If the people were believers in big families, and agreed\r\nto have twelve children--no anti-Malthusian would expect more than\r\nthat--they would be entitled to twelve relations during their marital\r\nlife. Assuming that not every act is followed by pregnancy, but that\r\nit takes on the average three or four times to bring about the desired\r\nresult, we will have it that during the wife's childbearing period the\r\ncouple may indulge in sex relations from once in three or four years\r\nto once or twice a year.\r\n\r\nCan a sane person knowing anything about the sexual instinct make any\r\nsuch demands from married people living in the same house and perhaps\r\noccupying the same bed? It must be borne in mind that as soon as the\r\nwife has reached the menopause all relations must cease, because she\r\ncan no longer become pregnant, and intercourse without a probable or\r\npossible pregnancy is a sin. Also remember that no matter how\r\nbeautiful, young and passionate the wife may be, if she has some\r\nlittle trouble which makes pregnancy impossible, sex relations must be\r\nabsolutely abstained from. And of course if the husband or wife is\r\nsterile, all relations must be renounced forever, no matter how strong\r\nthe libido may be in one or both.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that Nature did not act according to the formula of our\r\nsex fanatics; no pregnancy, no intercourse. If she had meant it to be\r\nthat way, she would have abolished sexual desire in woman immediately\r\nafter the menopause. Unfortunately this is not the case. For we know\r\nthat the sexual libido in women after the menopause is often and for\r\nseveral years stronger than before. Why? Nor has Nature abolished the\r\nsexual instinct and the passionate desire for sex relations in all\r\nthose men and women who are for some reason or other sterile, or\r\notherwise so defective that no child can result from the union.\r\n\r\nAs I stated at the beginning, it is a waste of time to _argue_ the\r\nmatter. Those who believe that sex relations are for racial purposes\r\nonly, are welcome to their belief, and are welcome to live up to it.\r\n(How few of them do, though, honestly and consistently?) We must\r\nreiterate our opinion that the sex instinct has other high purposes\r\nbesides that of perpetuating the race, and sex relations may and\r\nshould be indulged in as often as they are conducive to man's and\r\nwoman's physical, mental and spiritual health. No iron-clad rules can\r\nbe laid down as to the frequency. For some people three times a year\r\nmay be sufficient, others may require relations three times a month\r\n(the best for the average) and still others may not be satisfied with\r\nless than three times a week. The human _libido sexualis_ cannot be\r\nput into an iron mould, and you should pay no attention to religious\r\nfanatics who are ignorant of physiology and psychology and who can\r\nonly blunder and bungle up things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT\r\n\r\nVAGINISMUS\r\n\r\n Vaginismus--Dyspareunia--Difference Between Vaginismus and\r\n  Dyspareunia--Adherent Clitoris a Cause of Masturbation and\r\n  Convulsions.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the term vaginismus we understand a painful spasm or contraction of\r\nthe vaginal orifice which makes intercourse very difficult, or\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nCertain cases of vaginismus, or rather false vaginismus, may be due to\r\nlaceration or inflammation of the vaginal orifice, but in genuine\r\ncases of vaginismus no local disease can be found, because genuine\r\nvaginismus is of nervous origin.\r\n\r\n_Dyspareunia_ means painful or difficult intercourse, from whatever\r\ncause. It differs from vaginismus in that the cause is generally a\r\nlocal one, that is, it may be inflammation, laceration as after a\r\nconfinement, small size or atresia of the vagina, etc. When vaginismus\r\nis present, it is present in reference to all men, in fact the mere\r\ntouch of the finger or an instrument may call forth a painful spasm;\r\nwhile dyspareunia may show itself with one man and be absent with\r\nanother. The origin of the word dyspareunia shows that this may be\r\nthe case, for _dyspareunos_ in Greek means badly mated.\r\n\r\nDyspareunia must not be confused with true vaginismus. In dyspareunia\r\nthe sexual act can be freely indulged in, only the act is painful or\r\ndisagreeable. In vaginismus intercourse is _impossible_. In\r\nexceptional cases where the husband attempts to use brute force, the\r\nwife may faint away, she may get a convulsion or become wildly\r\nhysterical. If the husband insists in attempting relations, the wife\r\nmay run away, or in exceptional cases even attempt suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\nADHERENT CLITORIS OR PHIMOSIS\r\n\r\nThe word phimosis means \"muzzling,\" and it is a term applied to a\r\nconstriction or narrowing of the foreskin, so that the glands of the\r\nclitoris cannot be freely uncovered. This condition may give rise to\r\nan accumulation of smegma or secretion which may cause inflammation,\r\nitching, and nervous irritation. This in its turn may be the cause of\r\nmasturbation. It is claimed by some that an adherent clitoris may even\r\nbe the cause of convulsions resembling epilepsy. In some cases it\r\nleads to an irritable bladder, inability to retain the urine, and\r\nnocturnal bed-wetting.\r\n\r\nIn all girls, big or little, that show a tendency to masturbate or\r\nsimply to handle the genitals, or that complain of itching, the\r\nclitoris should be examined and if adhesions are found they should be\r\nseparated. This can easily be done under a local anesthetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY-NINE\r\n\r\nSTERILITY\r\n\r\n Definition of Sterility--Husband Should First be Examined--\r\n  One-child Sterility--The Fertile Woman--Salpingitis as a\r\n  Cause of Sterility--Leucorrhea and Sterility--Displacement of\r\n  Uterus and Sterility--Closure of Neck of Womb and Sterility--\r\n  Sterility and Constitutional Disease--Treatment of Sterility.\r\n\r\n\r\nSterility or barrenness is a condition of inability to have children.\r\nIn former years the opinion prevailed generally, whenever a couple was\r\nchildless, that the fault was exclusively the woman's. It wasn't even\r\nthought that the man could be to blame. We now know that in at least\r\n_fifty per cent._ of cases of sterility, or childless marriages, the\r\nfault is not the woman's but the man's. It is therefore very unwise in\r\nconditions of sterility to subject the wife to treatment without first\r\nexamining the husband. Nevertheless, this is still often the case,\r\nparticularly among the lower classes or among the ignorant. There are\r\ncases where the woman goes from one doctor to another for years and is\r\nsubjected to all kinds of treatment, when a simple examination of the\r\nhusband would show that the fault lies with him.\r\n\r\nSome women have one child and are unable afterwards to give birth to\r\nany more. Such a condition is called one-child-sterility. It is\r\ngenerally due to an inflammation of the Fallopian tubes which closes\r\nup the openings of the tubes into the womb, so that no more ova can\r\npass _from_ the ovaries _through_ the tubes _into_ the womb. This\r\ninflammation may be the result of childbirth, for childbirth alone may\r\nset up an inflammation, or it may be due to an infection contracted\r\nfrom the husband.\r\n\r\nIn order to be fertile, that is, to be able to conceive and give birth\r\nto a living child, the woman's external and internal genital organs\r\nmust be normal, her ovaries must produce healthy ova, and there must\r\nbe no obstruction on the way, so that the ova and the spermatozoa can\r\nmeet. The mucous membrane of the womb must also be healthy, so that\r\nwhen the impregnated ovum gets attached to the womb it may develop\r\nthere without any trouble, and not become diseased or poorly nourished\r\nand cast off.\r\n\r\nWe must always remember that the woman's share in bringing forth\r\nchildren and perpetuating the race is much more important than the\r\nman's. When a man has discharged his spermatozoa his work is done--the\r\nwoman's only commences.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which cause sterility in women are many, but the most\r\ncommon cause is a salpingitis or an inflammation of the Fallopian\r\ntubes, which may be caused by gonorrhea or any other inflammation. A\r\nsevere leucorrhea may also be the cause of sterility, because the\r\nleucorrheal discharge may be fatal to the spermatozoa. Another cause\r\nis a severe bending or turning of the uterus either forwards or\r\nbackwards. The opening of the neck of the womb, the os, may also be\r\nclosed, or practically so, from ulceration, from strong applications,\r\netc. In some cases sterility may be due to severe constitutional\r\ndisease, when the person is very much run down and so anemic that\r\nmenstruation stops. Unfortunately this is not always the case, for\r\nwomen even in the last stages of consumption may, and often do, become\r\npregnant. Syphilis unfortunately does not cause sterility; it only\r\ncauses miscarriages until controlled by treatment.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of sterility can be successfully carried out only by a\r\ncompetent physician, particularly by one who is devoting himself\r\nspecially to this kind of work. But I want once more to impress upon\r\nevery woman who is sterile, and who wants to have a child, not to have\r\nherself treated or even examined until her husband has been subjected\r\nto an examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY\r\n\r\nTHE HYMEN\r\n\r\n Difference Between Chastity and Virginity--Worship of Intact\r\n  Hymen--Sacrificing Hymen Sometimes Essential for Health of the\r\n  Girl--Certificate from Physician who has Ruptured Hymen.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have mentioned in a previous chapter that the absence of the hymen\r\nwas no proof of unchastity, just as the presence of the hymen was no\r\nproof of perfect chastity. Chastity and virginity are not synonymous,\r\nand a girl may possess physical virginity, that is, an intact hymen,\r\nand still be morally unchaste. She may be in the habit of indulging in\r\nunnatural sexual practices. But the laity does not know these facts or\r\ndoes not want to know them, and the intact hymen is still worshipped\r\nlike a fetish. This would be of little consequence, if it did not\r\noften result in unnecessary suffering to the female child or girl.\r\nMuch disease and a good deal of sterility result from the fear of\r\ntampering with the hymen.\r\n\r\nWhen a boy gets some trouble with his genital organs, such as\r\nphimosis, or balanitis or whatever it may be, he is at once taken to a\r\nphysician, who institutes the necessary treatment. When a little girl\r\ncomplains of itching around the genitals or of some discharge, the\r\nmother will hesitate long before taking her to a doctor. She will be\r\nafraid he will do something to the hymen. And so she will temporize,\r\nusing salves and washes, and the disease will in the meantime be\r\nmaking progress, that is, getting worse. When she does take her to a\r\nphysician, and he says that in order to treat the case thoroughly the\r\nhymen has to be stretched or opened, the mother will withhold her\r\nconsent, and the disease will be allowed to progress. I know of many\r\nsuch cases. This is wrong. When the health of the girl demands and her\r\nfuture child-bearing power is at stake, no hesitation should be felt\r\nin sacrificing the hymen.\r\n\r\nThough in the future the fuss which is now made about the hymen, the\r\nexcessive veneration in which it is held, will appear ridiculous, and\r\nthough I consider it foolish and rather humiliating to the girl,\r\nnevertheless, now, when the average husband does lay so much stress on\r\nthe presence of an unruptured hymen, a physician who in the course of\r\nan operation or treatment has occasion to cut or rupture the hymen,\r\nwill do well to give the patient a certificate to that effect. In case\r\nany question regarding the girl's chastity comes up in the future, she\r\ncan prove by the doctor's certificate that her loss of virginity was\r\nnot due to sexual relations. Of course the relations between husband\r\nand wife, or between prospective husband and wife, should be such that\r\nno \"certificate\" should be necessary; but reality differs from the\r\nideal, and in some cases that we know the husband's suspicions were\r\nallayed by the doctor's oral or written statement.\r\n\r\nThis is as good a place as any to emphasize, that if the bride has a\r\nvery strong, tough and resistant hymen, the new husband should not use\r\nbrute force in rupturing it. First, because the pain may be too\r\nexcruciating and this may create in the wife an aversion to\r\nintercourse which may last for many months or years--in some cases\r\nforever. Second, a severe hemorrhage may result, which may require the\r\naid of a physician to stop. Wherever a case of very resistant hymen is\r\nencountered, the husband should make several attempts; gradual and\r\ngentle dilatation, with the aid of a little vaseline and not forcible\r\nrupture should be the aim; the result will usually be satisfactory. In\r\nexceptional cases, a physician may have to be called in. The operation\r\nof cutting the hymen is a trifling one.\r\n\r\nIt is also interesting to know that some wives have sex relations for\r\nmonths and years, and the hymen remains unruptured. Pregnancy may also\r\nresult with an intact hymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-ONE\r\n\r\nIS THE ORGASM NECESSARY FOR IMPREGNATION?\r\n\r\n Suppression of Orgasm by Woman to Prevent Impregnation--Bad\r\n  Results of Suppression by the Woman--Orgasm: Relation of to\r\n  Impregnation--A Hypothesis--A Fanciful Hypothesis--Why Passionate\r\n  Women Frequently Fail to Become Mothers--Advice to Passionate\r\n  Women who Desire to Conceive.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the laity the opinion is quite prevalent that in order for a\r\nwoman to conceive she must experience an orgasm, she must have had a\r\npleasurable voluptuous sensation during the act. If she has no orgasm,\r\nimpregnation cannot take place. So sure are some women that this is so\r\nthat when they want to avoid conception they repress any orgastic\r\nfeeling; as they say, they don't let themselves go. Which, I will say,\r\nby the way, is one of the causes of female frigidity. If you don't\r\nhabitually permit a certain feeling to develop, if you repeatedly\r\nrepress it at the very beginning, at its first manifestation, it is\r\napt to atrophy altogether, to become permanently suppressed, or the\r\nsuppression develops into a nervous disorder.\r\n\r\nAmong the medical profession no perfect unanimity has been reached as\r\nto the role of the orgasm in impregnation. Some sexologists like Kisch\r\nand Vaerting believe it does play an important role; others, like\r\nForel, believe it plays none. That the orgasm is not _necessary_ for\r\nimpregnation admits of no discussion. Women who suffer from frigidity\r\nin an extreme degree, women who never experienced an orgasm, women who\r\nrepress their orgasm, women in sleep or under narcosis, women who have\r\nbeen raped, women who loathe their husbands, become pregnant\r\nfrequently and readily. But does it play any role at all? Does it\r\nfacilitate impregnation? Other things being equal, will intercourse\r\naccompanied by an orgasm be more likely to prove fruitful than one in\r\nwhich the orgasm was entirely absent? This question I am forced to\r\nanswer in the affirmative. Because from the various investigations I\r\nhave made it can hardly be subject to doubt that the uterus during an\r\norgasm exerts a certain amount of suction; and that impregnation is\r\n_more likely_ to follow when the spermatozoa are sucked up into the\r\nuterus than when left to make their own way by their own power of\r\nmotion, stands to reason and goes without saying. In the former\r\ninstance it takes less time for the spermatozoa to reach the ovum, and\r\nthere is less chance for them to perish on the way--from malnutrition\r\nor from coming in contact with secretions of an acid reaction. There\r\nis another point. I do not bring it forth as a proved fact or as a\r\nfact susceptible to proof. It is a mere hypothesis, but in my opinion\r\nit is a correct and plausible hypothesis. I believe that the strong\r\nspasmodic contractions that take place during the orgasm have an\r\ninfluence not only in accelerating the bursting of a Graafian follicle\r\nand the extrusion of an ovum, but they are instrumental in aiding the\r\nFallopian tube to grasp the ovum and helping it along on the road\r\ntowards the uterus. It is therefore not at all inconceivable that\r\nconception may take place during or within a very short time after an\r\nact which is accompanied by a proper orgasm. Many women claim to\r\nexperience peculiar unmistakable sensations as soon as conception has\r\ntaken place, and by calculating the day of probable delivery we know\r\nthat they are right. Taking therefore all the various data into\r\nconsideration we are fully justified in saying that while an orgasm or\r\na voluptuous sensation during the act is not at all _necessary_ to\r\nimpregnation, it is in many cases a helpful factor.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by some that the offspring resulting from an orgastic\r\nact is apt to be healthier and better developed than offspring\r\nresulting from sexual intercourse in which the parties experience no\r\norgasm. The reason given being that conception in the first instance\r\ntaking place quickly, the spermatozoa are better nourished and more\r\nvigorous. In my opinion this is merely a fanciful hypothesis which\r\nneedn't be taken seriously.\r\n\r\nIt will be found rather frequently that women of strong passionate\r\nnatures, with strong orgastic feelings, and normal in every way, fail\r\nto become mothers. A careful investigation of their menstrual\r\ndischarge will show that _it is not because they failed to conceive_,\r\nbut because the impregnated ovum is expelled each time; in other\r\nwords, they have each month a miniature miscarriage. And these\r\nmiscarriages, or rather abortions, are due to the spasmodic\r\ncontractions of the uterus and its adnexae which accompany the orgasm.\r\nIn such cases I have advised the woman to try to remain passive during\r\nthe act, to repress the orgasm, and the results have in some instances\r\nshown the wisdom of my advice. After conception has taken place, after\r\none period has been missed, the woman should abstain from intercourse\r\naltogether or at least for two or three months until the fetus is\r\nsecurely attached to, or ensconced in, the uterus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-TWO\r\n\r\nFRIGIDITY IN WOMEN\r\n\r\n Meaning of Term Frigidity--Types of Frigidity--Large Percentage of\r\n  Frigid Women--Repression of Sexual Manifestations and Frigidity--\r\n  Frigidity and Masturbation--Frigidity and Sexual Weakness of\r\n  Husband--Frigidity and Dislike of Husband--Organic Causes of\r\n  Frigidity--A Frigid Woman May Become Passionate--Treatment of\r\n  Frigidity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word frigidity means coldness, and when a woman has no desire for\r\nsexual relations or experiences no pleasure when she has sexual\r\nrelations, she is said to be frigid.\r\n\r\nSome cases suffer only from lack of desire, others only from lack of\r\npleasure, and still others from both. In some cases the frigidity is\r\ncongenital, that is, the lack of desire with inability to experience\r\npleasure during the act is inborn. In most cases, however, it is\r\nacquired, or is only temporary, and is due to various causes.\r\nFrigidity is much more widespread among women than it is among men.\r\nSome physicians claim it is present in fifty per cent. of all women.\r\nThis may be an exaggeration, but if we put the number at twenty-five\r\nper cent. we will be quite near the truth.\r\n\r\nThe causes of frigidity in women are many, but here are the most\r\nimportant ones: First and foremost is the repression of all sexual\r\nmanifestations which the unmarried woman has to practice, and has had\r\nto practice for many centuries. So that a part of the frigidity is\r\nhereditary. You cannot entirely eradicate a natural instinct, but that\r\nby continually repressing it, by giving it no chance to assert itself,\r\nyou may weaken it--about this there can be no question.\r\n\r\nThe second cause is masturbation. Cases that have been addicted to\r\nexcessive masturbation are very apt to develop not only frigidity, but\r\ncomplete aversion to the sexual act, and inability to experience any\r\npleasure or orgasm. Such cases we come across every day.\r\n\r\nA third very important cause is sexual weakness in the husband. When\r\nthe husband is sexually weak (suffering with premature ejaculations)\r\nhe either fails to awaken the sexual instinct in the woman, or if it\r\nhas been awakened it is apt to turn not only into frigidity but into\r\naversion to the act.\r\n\r\nThe fourth cause is often merely dislike towards the husband. The last\r\ntwo causes, weakness of the husband and dislike towards him, are\r\nunfortunately very frequent, and a wife who was frigid with one\r\nhusband may show herself very passionate on marrying another man.\r\n\r\nThe fifth cause is fear of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe above are the five principal causes. Other causes may be disease\r\nof the uterus, laceration of the cervix, inflammation of the ovaries,\r\nvaginismus, disease of the thyroid gland, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is an unfortunate fact that women who were frigid up to the age of\r\nforty or so may become very passionate after that age.\r\n\r\nAs to the treatment of frigidity, little or nothing can be done for\r\nfrigidity that is congenital. Most of the other kinds of frigidity,\r\nhowever, can be cured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-THREE\r\n\r\nADVICE TO FRIGID WOMEN, PARTICULARLY WIVES\r\n\r\n Advice to Frigid Women--Attitude of Different Men Towards Frigid\r\n  Wives--Orgasm a Subjective Feeling--A Justifiable Innocent\r\n  Deception--The Case of a Demi-Mondaine.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to give you a piece of advice which is of extremely great\r\nimportance to you. I hesitated somewhat before writing this chapter,\r\nbut the welfare of so many women depends upon following this advice,\r\nand I have seen the lives of so many wives spoiled on account of not\r\nhaving followed it, that I decided to devote a few words to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAs you know, about one-third or one-quarter of all women (in other\r\nwords, one out of every three or four) are sexually frigid. They\r\neither have little or no sexual desire, or if they do have, they\r\nexperience no voluptuous sensation during the act, and never have an\r\norgasm. If you are unmarried, well and good. But if you are married\r\nand happen to belong to the frigid type, then _don't inform your\r\nhusband of the fact_. It may lead to great and permanent trouble. Some\r\nhusbands don't care. Some are even glad if their wives are frigid.\r\nThey can then consult their own wishes in the matter, they can have\r\nintercourse whenever they want and _the way they want_. They do not\r\nhave to accommodate themselves to their wives' ways, they do not have\r\nto prolong the act until she gets the orgasm, etc. In short, some\r\nhusbands consider a frigid wife a blessing, a God-sent treasure. But,\r\nas I mentioned several times before, in sexual matters every man is a\r\nlaw unto himself, and some men feel extremely bad and displeased when\r\nthey find out that their wives have \"no feeling.\" Some become furious,\r\nsome become disgusted. Some lose all pleasure in intercourse, and some\r\nclaim to be unable to have intercourse with any woman who is not\r\nproperly responsive. Some begin to go to other women, while some\r\nthreaten or demand a divorce (of course, such men cannot really love\r\ntheir wives; they may use their wives' frigidity as an _excuse_ to get\r\nrid of them).\r\n\r\nNow, a man has no way of knowing whether a woman has a feeling during\r\nthe act or not, whether or no she enjoys it, whether or no she has an\r\norgasm. These are subjective feelings, and the man cannot know them\r\nunless you tell him. If you belong to the independent kind, if you\r\nscorn simulation and deceit, if, as the price of being perfectly\r\ntruthful, you are willing if necessary to part with your husband or\r\ngive him a divorce, well and good. You are a free human being, and\r\nnobody has a right to tell you what to do with your body. But if you\r\ncare for your husband, if you care for your home and perhaps children,\r\nand do not want any disruption, then the only thing for you to do is\r\nnot to apprise your husband of your frigid condition. And it won't\r\nhurt you to simulate a feeling which you do not experience, and even\r\nto imitate the orgasm. He won't be any the wiser, he will enjoy you\r\nmore, and nobody will be injured by your little deception, which is\r\nafter all a species of white lie, and is nobody's business but your\r\nown. An innocent deception which hurts nobody, but, on the contrary,\r\nbenefits all concerned, is perfectly permissible.\r\n\r\nIt may seem rather strange publicly to give advice to deceive and to\r\nsimulate. And it is undoubtedly the first time that this advice has\r\nbeen given in print. But as I have only one religion--the greatest\r\nhappiness of the greatest number--I repeat that I can see nothing\r\nwrong in advising something which benefits everybody (concerned) and\r\nhurts nobody. More than one household which was threatened with\r\ndisruption was preserved safe and sound by a little simple advice\r\nwhich I gave to the wife, without the husband's knowledge. He was\r\nsatisfied, and things after that ran smoothly.\r\n\r\nSome women are afraid to simulate a voluptuous or orgastic feeling,\r\nbecause they think the husband can discover whether their feeling is\r\ngenuine or they are only simulating. (Women, and men too, have funny\r\nideas on sexual subjects). This is not so. A notorious demi-mondaine,\r\nwho was greatly sought because she was known to be so \"passionate,\"\r\nconfessed that not once in her life did she enjoy intercourse or\r\nexperience an orgasm. But her mother, who also suffered with absolute\r\nfrigidity, taught her to simulate passion, telling her that in that\r\nway she could make barrels of money; which she did.\r\n\r\nIt is deplorable that wives--or husbands--should ever be obliged to\r\nhave recourse to deception or simulation; perfect frankness should be\r\nthe ideal to be striven after. But under our present social conditions\r\nand with the present moral code, an occasional white lie is the lesser\r\nof two evils; it may be the least of a dozen evils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-FOUR\r\n\r\nRAPE\r\n\r\n Definition of Rape--Age of Consent--Unanimous Opinion of\r\n  Experts--Exceptional Cases--False Accusation of Rape Due to\r\n  Perversion--Erotic Dreams Under Anesthesia Causing Accusations\r\n  Against Doctors and Dentists.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving intercourse with a woman by force, without her consent, is\r\ncalled rape. When the woman is not in a condition to give consent, as\r\nwhen she is insane, feebleminded, unconscious or drunk, or when she is\r\nnot of the age at which she can legally give consent, it also\r\nconstitutes rape, and the punishment is the same. The age of consent\r\ndiffers in different countries and in different States, but as a rule\r\nis between sixteen and eighteen years. That is, if a girl under the\r\nlegal age of consent should give her consent or even if she should\r\nurge the man to have intercourse with her the man would be punished\r\njust as if he had committed rape.\r\n\r\nThe punishment for rape is very severe in all civilized countries and\r\nranges from ten years' imprisonment to life imprisonment, while in\r\nsome States in this Union the punishment is death.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to go into an exhaustive discussion of this\r\npainful subject. In this brief chapter I merely wish to bring out two\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nFirst, that it is the almost unanimous opinion of all experts that it\r\nis practically impossible for a man to commit rape on a normal adult\r\ngirl or woman if she really offers all the resistance of which she is\r\ncapable. Of course, if the man knocks the woman down with a blow,\r\nrendering her unconscious, that is a different matter. But where no\r\nbrutality is used by the man, and the woman offers all the resistance\r\nshe is capable of, rape is practically impossible. It is, however,\r\npossible that in some cases the girl may be so paralyzed by fear as to\r\nbe incapable of offering any resistance. When the man threatens her\r\nwith death or severe bodily injury, then it is rape even if she offers\r\nno resistance.\r\n\r\nThe second point is that it has been established that of the many\r\naccusations of rape brought before the courts _most_ are false. Out of\r\na hundred cases only about ten are true. The rest are false. This\r\nfalse accusation of rape is due to a peculiar perversion with which\r\nsome women suffer. Some of the cases are due to hysteria, to\r\nimagination, the women really believing that rape or an attempt at\r\nrape was committed on them, while investigation shows the accusation\r\nto be entirely false. Many accusations of rape are due to a desire\r\nfor revenge or merely to motives of blackmail.\r\n\r\nCareful doctors and dentists will refuse to give laughing gas or\r\nanother anesthetic to women except in the presence of others, because,\r\nas is well known, an anesthetic often causes in women erotic dreams\r\nand sensations and makes them believe that the doctor was committing\r\nor about to commit an indecent assault on them, and when they come out\r\nof the anesthetic they may be so sure of the reality of their dream\r\nthat they will bring a complaint against the doctor. Many men have\r\nsuffered disgrace and imprisonment and have had their lives ruined or\r\neven paid the death penalty on account of false accusations against\r\nthem by either pervert, hysterical, revengeful or blackmailing women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-FIVE\r\n\r\nTHE SINGLE STANDARD OF SEXUAL MORALITY\r\n\r\n Chastity--Double Standard of Morality--Attempt to Abolish Double\r\n  Standard--Late Marriages and Chastity in Men--Harmful Advice\r\n  Given to Young Women--Chastity in Men Not Always Due to Moral\r\n  Principles--Chaste Men and Satisfactory Husbands--A Statement by\r\n  Professor Freud--A Statement by Professor Michels--What a Girl\r\n  has a Right to Demand of Her Future Husband--Three Cases Showing\r\n  Disastrous Effects of Wrong Teachings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a man marries a girl he expects her to be chaste, that is, a\r\nvirgin, without any sexual experiences. Of men, the same chastity is\r\nnot expected as a general thing. As long as a man is healthy, free\r\nfrom venereal disease, his previous sexual experiences do not\r\nconstitute a barrier to his marriage. This is what is known as the\r\ndouble or duplex standard of sex morality.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years a number of high-minded and well-meaning men\r\nand women have been trying to abolish this double standard and to\r\nintroduce a single standard of morality. That is, they are demanding\r\nthat the man going to the marriage bed should be just as chaste, just\r\nas virginal as his wife is. Whether or no the efforts of these good\r\nmen and women will ever be crowned with success we will leave open.\r\nWhether or no it is even desirable that their efforts _should_ be\r\ncrowned with success we will also leave open. A complete discussion of\r\nthese questions belongs to a more advanced book on sexual ethics. Here\r\nI will merely say that, taking into consideration the fact that the\r\nsexual instinct in boys awakens fully at the age of fifteen or\r\nsixteen, and that marriage at the present time, particularly among the\r\nprofessional classes, is an impossibility before the age of\r\ntwenty-eight, thirty, or thirty-five, it seems to be impossible and\r\nundesirable to expect that men should live a perfectly chaste life\r\nuntil they enter matrimony, no matter how late that event may take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThose who have made a study of the sex instinct in the male seem to\r\nthink that chastity in normal, healthy men up to the age of thirty or\r\nthereabouts is an impossibility, and where it is accomplished it is\r\naccomplished at the expense of the physical, mental, and sexual health\r\nof the individual. But be it as it may, and leaving disputed questions\r\nout of discussion, the fact remains that the vast majority of men of\r\nthe present day do indulge in sex relations before marriage. And\r\npeople that are urging upon our young women to refuse to marry men who\r\nhave not been perfectly chaste are doing our womanhood a very poor\r\nservice. As it is now, with all mandom to choose from, there are many,\r\ntoo many, old maids. With only ten per cent. to choose from (because\r\nit is admitted that at least 90 per cent. of all men have\r\nante-matrimonial relations), what would our women do? They would\r\npractically all have to give up any hopes of being married and\r\nbecoming mothers. And if these ten per cent., who have remained chaste\r\nto their married day, were at least a superior class of men in every\r\ninstance, there would be some compensation in that. Unfortunately,\r\nthis is far from being the case, because, as all advanced sexologists\r\nwill tell you, there is generally something wrong with a man who\r\nremains absolutely chaste until the age of thirty, thirty-five or\r\nforty. It isn't moral principles in all cases; it is mostly cowardice,\r\nor sexual weakness. And sad as it may be to state, these perfectly\r\ngood, chaste men do not generally make satisfactory husbands, and\r\ntheir wives are not apt to be the happiest ones. I fully agree with\r\nProfessor Freud in his statement \"that sexual abstinence does not help\r\nto build up energetic, independent men of action, original thinkers,\r\nbold advocates of freedom and reform, but rather goody-goody\r\nweaklings.\" And still more to the purpose is the statement of\r\nProfessor Michels, who says:\r\n\r\n\"The desire that one's daughter may marry a man who, like herself, and\r\non an equal footing, will gain in marriage his first experience of the\r\nmost sacred mysteries of the sexual life, is one which _may lead to\r\nprofound disillusionments_. Even if to-day the demand for chaste young\r\nmen is extremely restricted, the supply is yet more so, and the\r\narticle _is of such an inferior quality_ that in actual practice the\r\nattempt to satisfy this desire is likely to lead to results which will\r\nfail altogether to correspond to the hopes inspired by a contemplation\r\nof the abstract idea of purity. Many physically intact individuals of\r\nboth sexes _are far more contaminated_ than those who have had actual\r\nsexual experience. Others again, superior in the abstract, and from\r\nthe physically sexual aspect, are _ethically inferior to the\r\nunchaste_, so that the union with these latter would be more likely to\r\nprove happy than a union with those who are nominally pure.\" And\r\nfurther, \"Careful fathers of marriageable daughters, who seek this\r\nvirginity in their sons-in-law, will, if they find it, seldom find it\r\na guarantee for the simultaneous possession of solid moral qualities.\"\r\n\r\nAll a girl has a right to demand is that her future husband be in good\r\nhealth, physically and sexually, and that he be free from venereal\r\ndisease. His previous sexual life, provided he is a man of fine moral\r\ncharacter in general, is no concern of hers. Even if the man was\r\nunfortunate enough to have contracted gonorrhea, that fact should\r\nconstitute no bar to marriage, provided he is completely cured of it.\r\nThe only exception is that of syphilis. The girl has a right to refuse\r\nabsolutely to enter into union with any man who has been infected with\r\nsyphilis unless she is willing, and does it with her eyes open, to\r\nlive her life without any children. In syphilis we can never give an\r\n_absolute guarantee_ of cure and we have no right to subject a woman\r\nto any danger of infection with syphilis, be the danger ever so\r\nslight, without her knowledge and consent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Disastrous Effects of Wrong Teachings=\r\n\r\nWhat disastrous effects wrong teaching which inoculates the minds of\r\nour women with wrong ideas may have, the following three cases\r\nreported briefly in _The Critic and Guide_, will show:\r\n\r\n=Case One= was a girl of twenty-four, of well-to-do parents, a college\r\ngraduate. She was engaged to a really very nice, sympathetic young\r\nman, who undoubtedly would have made her an excellent husband. But\r\nduring her last two years in college she became imbued with the single\r\nstandard stupidity, and \"chastity for men, votes for women\" became her\r\nslogan. She asked her fiance if he had been absolutely chaste before\r\nhe met her. He did not want to play the hypocrite, and he told her the\r\ntruth that he had not. But he assured her that he had never been\r\ninfected and that his general and sexual health was in excellent\r\ncondition. Being then in an exalted mood, she impulsively broke the\r\nengagement, declaring that her husband will have to be as \"pure\" as\r\nshe was. She soon regretted her step, because she loved the man; but\r\npride did not let her take the initiative towards a reconciliation,\r\nand in the meantime her former fiance fell in love with and married\r\nanother girl. After four years had passed, and she was in danger of\r\nbecoming an old maid, she married a man considerably beneath her\r\nsocially and intellectually, and in every way inferior to her former\r\nfiance. Her marriage is not a happy one.\r\n\r\n=Case two= is similar to case one, except that the young lady in\r\nquestion--now not so very young--is still living in single\r\nblessedness, and the chances of her ever being a wife or even\r\nsomebody's sweetheart are rapidly vanishing. I might add that her\r\nfiance whom she discarded because of his lack of virginity was a very\r\nbright young physician, who is now very successful and very happily\r\nmarried. She I hear is a very unhappy person, in danger of sinking\r\ninto a permanent state of melancholia. And she had been of a very\r\njolly disposition.\r\n\r\n=Case three= is peculiar in that the fiance _was_ absolutely chaste.\r\nShe asked him, and he told her that he had never had any relations\r\nwith anybody and he never had a trace or suspicion of any venereal\r\ndisease. The young lady was not satisfied. She wanted her fiance to\r\nbring her a certificate from a specialist testifying to that effect.\r\nThe young man told her that it was foolish, that he would not subject\r\nhimself to the expense and annoyance of a number of tests when he\r\n_knew_ that not only did he not have any venereal disease, but that\r\nthere was no possibility of his getting any. No, that did not satisfy\r\nher. She became suspicious. \"If you have nothing to fear, why do you\r\nobject to bringing a certificate?\" \"I have nothing to fear, but I\r\ndemand that you respect me and trust me sufficiently to believe that I\r\nam telling the truth when I declare a thing with such positiveness. If\r\nyou do not have that much confidence in me now, our future life does\r\nnot hold much promise of success.\" One word led to another, and then\r\nhe broke the engagement, as any self-respecting man under the\r\ncircumstances would. He is married, and she is not and probably never\r\nwill be. Three young lives ruined by perverse teachings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-SIX\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAN'S AND WOMAN'S SEX AND LOVE LIFE\r\n\r\n Seemingly Contradictory Statements--Faulty Interpretations of\r\n  Words Sexual Instinct and Love--Difference in Manifestations of\r\n  Male and Female Sexual Instincts--Man's Sex Instinct Grosser Than\r\n  Woman's--Awakening of Sexual Desire in the Boy and in the\r\n  Girl--Woman's Desire for Caresses--Man's Main Desire for Sexual\r\n  Relations--Normal Sex Relations as Means of Holding a Man--A\r\n  Physiological Reason Why Man is Held--Man and Physical\r\n  Love--Woman and Spiritual Love--Preliminaries of Sexual\r\n  Intercourse in Men and Women--Physical Attributes--Mental and\r\n  Spiritual Qualities--Difference Between Love and \"Being in\r\n  Love\"--Love as a Stimulus to Man--When the Man Loves--When the\r\n  Woman Loves--Man's More Engrossing Interests--Lovemaking Irksome\r\n  to Man--Man's Polygamous Tendencies--Woman Single-affectioned in\r\n  Her Sex and Love Life--Man and Woman Biologically Different.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reading books or listening to lectures on sex, you will meet with\r\nstatements which will seem to you contradictory. One time you will\r\nread or hear that the sex instinct is much more powerfully developed\r\nin man than it is in woman; next time you will come across the\r\nstatement that sex plays a much more important role in women than it\r\ndoes in men. One time you will hear that men are oversexed, that they\r\nare by nature polygamous and promiscuous, while woman is monogamous\r\nand as a rule sexually frigid; the next time you will be assured that\r\nwithout love a woman's life is nothing, and you will be confronted\r\nwith Byron's well-known and oft quoted two lines: Man's love is of\r\nman's life a thing apart, 'Tis woman's whole existence.\r\n\r\nThese contradictions are only apparent and result from two facts:\r\nfirst, that the words sex or sexual instinct and love are used\r\nindiscriminately and interchangeably as if they were synonymous terms,\r\nwhich they are not; second, there is failure to bear in mind the\r\nessential differences in the natures and manifestations of the sexual\r\ninstincts in the male and the female. If these differences are made\r\nclear, the apparent contradictions will disappear. The outstanding\r\nfact to bear in mind is that in man the sex instinct bears a more\r\nsensual, a more physical, a coarser and grosser character, if you have\r\nno objection to these adjectives, than it does in woman. In women it\r\nis finer, more spiritual, more platonic, to use this stereotyped and\r\nincorrect term. In men the sex manifestations are more centralized,\r\nmore local, more concentrated in the sex organs; in women they are\r\nmore diffused throughout the body. In a boy of fifteen the libido\r\nsexualis may be fully developed, he may have powerful erections and a\r\nstrong desire for normal sexual relations; in a girl of fifteen there\r\nmay not be a trace of any purely sexual desire; and this _lack_ of\r\ndesire for _physical_ sex relations may manifest itself in women up to\r\nthe age of twenty or twenty-five (something that we never see in\r\nnormal men); in fact, women of twenty-five and even older, who have\r\nnot been stimulated and whose curiosity has not been aroused by\r\nnovels, pictures, and tales of their married companions, may not\r\nexperience any sexual desire until several months after marriage. But\r\nwhile their desire for actual sexual relations awakens much later than\r\nit does in men, their desire for love, for caresses, for hugging, for\r\nclose friendship, for love letters, awakens much earlier than in men,\r\nand occupies a greater part in their life; they think of love more\r\nduring their waking hours, and they dream of it more than men do.\r\n\r\nA man--always bear in mind that when speaking of men and women I\r\nalways speak of the average; exceptions in either direction will be\r\nfound in both sexes--a man, I say, will generally tire of paying\r\nattentions to a woman if he feels that they will not eventually lead\r\nto the biologic goal--sexual relations. A woman can keep up with a man\r\nfor years without any sexual intercourse, being fully satisfied or\r\nmore or less satisfied with the sexual substitutes--embraces and\r\nkisses.\r\n\r\nAnd here is as good a place as any to refer to the notion so\r\nassiduously inculcated in the minds of young women, that a persistent\r\nrefusal of man's demands is a sure way of keeping a man's affections;\r\nthat as soon as man has satisfied his desires, he has no further use\r\nfor the girl. This may be the case with the lowest dregs--morally--of\r\nthe male sex; it is the opposite of true of the male sex as a whole.\r\nAnd I believe that Marcel Prevost was the first one to point it out\r\n(in his _Le Jardin Secret_). Nothing will hold a man's affections so\r\nsurely as normal sex relations. And the cause of this is not, as might\r\nbe surmised, merely a moral one, the man considering himself in honor\r\nand duty bound to stick to the woman whose body he possessed. No,\r\nthere is a much stronger and surer reason: the reason is of a\r\nphysiological character. There is born a strong physical attraction\r\nwhich in the man's subconsciousness plays a stronger role than honor\r\nand duty. Excesses of course must be avoided, for excesses lead to\r\nsatiety, and satiety is just as inimical to love as is excitement\r\nwithout any satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Choice Between Physical and Spiritual Love=\r\n\r\nBut to return to our thesis: the difference between man's and woman's\r\nsex and love life. If a man had to make his _choice_ between physical\r\nlove, i.e., actual sex relations and spiritual love, i.e., love\r\nmaking, kisses, love letters, etc., he would generally choose the\r\nformer. If a woman had to _choose_, she would generally choose the\r\nlatter. The man and the woman would prefer both at the same time:\r\nphysical and spiritual love. But that is not the question. The\r\nquestion is: if it came to a _choice_; and then the results would be\r\nas I have just indicated. The correctness of my statements will be\r\ncorroborated by anybody having some knowledge of human sexuality. A\r\nman can fully enjoy sexual intercourse without any preliminaries; with\r\na woman the preliminaries are of the utmost importance, and when these\r\nare lacking she is often incapable of experiencing any pleasure. Nay,\r\nthe feeling of pleasure is not infrequently replaced by a feeling of\r\ndissatisfaction and even disgust. A man cares more for the physical\r\nand less for the mental and spiritual attributes of his sexual\r\npartner; with the woman just the opposite is the case. I am leaving\r\nout of consideration sexual impotence, because this is a real\r\ndisability, and a man suffering with it only irritates the woman\r\nwithout satisfying her. For this she will not stand. But where the man\r\nis sexually potent--he may be aged and homely--his other physical\r\nattributes play but a small role with woman; his mental and spiritual\r\nqualities count with her for a good deal more. While a woman may be\r\nable to give a man perfect sexual satisfaction, and she may have an\r\nangelic character, if her body is not all that could be desired, the\r\nman will be dissatisfied and unhappy.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Love in Man Occupies Subordinate Place=\r\n\r\nTry as we may, we cannot get away from the fact that in man's life\r\nlove occupies a subordinate place. I am speaking now of love, and not\r\nof \"being in love.\" Being in love, as pointed out in another place, is\r\na distinctly pathological phenomenon, akin to insanity, and when a man\r\nis in love it may engross every fiber of him, it may preoccupy every\r\nminute of his waking hours, he may neglect all his work and shirk all\r\nhis duties, in fact he is apt to make a much bigger fool of himself\r\nthan a woman is under similar circumstances. He is less patient, he\r\nhas less control over himself, he is less able to suffer, he is less\r\ncapable of self-sacrifice. But this, as I said, all refers to \"being\r\nin love,\" which is an entirely different thing from loving. A man may\r\nlove ever so deeply, and if his love is reciprocated he will go on\r\nwith his work in a smooth, unruffled manner. He will do better work\r\nfor it--love is a wonderful stimulus--but he will be perfectly\r\nsatisfied if he sees his love for an hour or two every day, or even\r\nonce or twice a week. And if he has important and interesting work to\r\ndo, he can part with his love for three months or six months without\r\nhis heart breaking. Not so with woman. A woman who loves considers\r\nevery day on which she does not see her lover a day lost. And she is\r\napt to be unhappy and inefficient in her work on such days, and she\r\nbears separation with much greater difficulty than does man. I do not\r\nthink that this is due to the fact that a woman's love is always more\r\nintense than a man's; no. But he usually has other interests which\r\noccupy his thoughts and his emotions, while most women's thoughts and\r\nemotions are centered on the man they love. When a woman loves, she\r\ncould and would spend all her time with the man she loves. She would\r\nnever tire of love making (I am not referring here to sex relations),\r\nor merely of being in the man's proximity. To woman love is a cloyless\r\nthing. Man distinctly does tire. No matter how much he may love a\r\nwoman, too much lovemaking becomes cloying to him, and he wants to get\r\naway. Even mere proximity, if too prolonged, becomes irksome to him,\r\nand he begins to fret and fidget, and pull at his chains, even if the\r\nchains are but of gossamer. Woman should know these facts and act\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Polygamous Tendencies in Man=\r\n\r\nWe now come to the last point in our discussion: the polygamous or\r\nvarietist tendencies in the male versus the monogamous tendencies in\r\nthe female. No matter what our moralists, who try to fit the facts to\r\ntheir theories instead of fitting their theories to the facts, may\r\nsay, the fact remains that man is a strongly polygamous or varietist\r\nanimal. That many men live through their lives without having had\r\nrelations with any women except their wives is cheerfully admitted. I\r\nassert this in spite of the incredulous smiles of all the cynics and\r\nroues in the world. I have known personally a great number of such\r\nmen. But that they do it without any struggle, and in some cases a\r\nvery severe struggle, is emphatically denied. And that hundreds of\r\nthousands of men are unequal to the struggle--or do not care to engage\r\nin any struggle--and live a sexually promiscuous life--anybody who\r\nknows anything about life as it is will testify. And his testimony\r\nwill be corroborated by the reports of the vice commissions and the\r\nstatements of disreputable-house keepers. To a great percentage of men\r\na strictly monogamous life is either irksome, painful, disagreeable or\r\nan utter impossibility. While the number of women who are not\r\nsatisfied with one mate is exceedingly small.\r\n\r\nA man may love a woman deeply and sincerely and at the same time make\r\nlove to another woman, or have sexual relations with her or even with\r\nprostitutes. It is quite a _common_ thing with men. It is quite a rare\r\nthing with women, though it may happen. As iterated and reiterated\r\ntime and again, there are always exceptional cases, but we are\r\nspeaking of the average and not of the exception. The _rule_ is that\r\nin her sex and love life woman is much more loyal, much more faithful,\r\nmuch more single-affectioned than is her lord and master--man.\r\n\r\nIs she on account of it better than, superior to, man? It is futile to\r\nspeak of better or worse, of superior or inferior. This is the way\r\nthey are. This is the way man and woman have been made by nature, by a\r\nthousand centuries of heredity, by a thousand centuries of\r\nenvironment. The differences lie in biological roots, and it is futile\r\nto fight and rail against nature and biology. The proper thing to do\r\nis to recognize the facts and make the best of them. To act the part\r\nof the ostrich, deliberately to ignore facts which are not pleasant,\r\nmay be easy, but is it wise?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN\r\n\r\nMATERNAL IMPRESSIONS\r\n\r\n Wide-spread Belief in Maternal Impressions--No Single\r\n  Well-authenticated Case of Maternal Impression--Birth of\r\n  Monstrosities--Ridiculous Examples Given by Physicians--So-called\r\n  Shock Often a Product of Mother's Imagination--Four Cases of\r\n  Alleged Maternal Impressions--Mother's Health During Pregnancy\r\n  May Have Effect Upon Child's General Health.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is believed by many people that strong impressions made upon the\r\nmother during pregnancy may produce marks or defects in the child.\r\nThis belief dates from earliest antiquity, and is widespread among all\r\nraces. The belief particularly refers to the emotions of fright or\r\nsudden surprise; thus it is believed that if a woman during pregnancy\r\nshould be frightened by some animal, the child might carry the mark of\r\nthe animal upon its body, or it might even be born in the shape of the\r\nanimal. Thousands of such _alleged_ cases are given in proof. There is\r\nhardly a layman, or, particularly, a laywoman, who does not claim to\r\nknow of authentic cases of maternal impressions.\r\n\r\nIt is a thankless task to try to shatter well-established beliefs,\r\nand I do not hope to succeed in persuading all my readers that all the\r\nstories and examples of maternal impressions are untrue and lack\r\nscientific foundation. But I consider it my duty to state my belief,\r\nwhether you accept it or not. In my opinion there is not a single\r\n_well-authenticated_ case of maternal impression. There is hardly a\r\ncase of defect or monstrosity where the cause is supposed to be due to\r\nmaternal impression, which cannot be explained in some natural way, or\r\nsimply by accident. Thousands of women are frightened or shocked by\r\ndisagreeable sights, by crippled men, by animals, and still their\r\nchildren are born perfectly normal. On the other hand, many marked, or\r\ndefective, or monstrous children are born in which no maternal\r\nimpressions can be given as the cause. So why can it not happen when\r\nthe mother was frightened by something during her pregnancy, and the\r\nchild was born with some mark or defect, that the latter was simply an\r\naccident and not the _result_ of the impression? Because a thing\r\n_follows_ another thing it does not mean that it was _caused_ by that\r\nother thing.\r\n\r\nMany of the cases given as examples, and by physicians too, are so\r\nridiculous that no scientific man can give them the slightest credence\r\nfor one moment. When a physician (Dr. Thomas J. Savage) tells us that\r\nhe attended a lady who had been frightened by a large green frog at or\r\nabout the middle of pregnancy, and that she gave birth to a\r\nmonstrosity, the head of which was that of a large frog in shape, with\r\nthe eyes and mouth and even the coloring of a frog, then he is either\r\ntelling an untruth, or he shows himself as ignorant and credulous as\r\nany illiterate old woman can be. The doctor should know that at the\r\nmiddle of pregnancy the child is _fully formed_ and that there is no\r\npossibility of an already formed human being changing its shape into\r\nthat of an animal. Another example given by the same doctor, and\r\nshowing the calibre of his mentality, is that of a child which, when\r\nan infant, not old enough to walk, \"would crawl over the floor and\r\npick up little objects such as pins, tacks, small beads, without the\r\nslightest difficulty or fumbling.\" The reason for this \"remarkable\"\r\nskill the good doctor ascribes to the fact that four months before the\r\nbirth of this child the mother had an outing in the woods and had\r\nderived great enjoyment from gathering hickory nuts which she found\r\nscattered among the leaves with which the ground was thickly covered!\r\n\r\nVery often the so-called shock or fright which the mother experiences\r\nduring gestation is simply a product of her imagination. We know of\r\nmany cases where the mothers never mentioned that anything happened\r\nto them, and only after the child was born with some kind of mark or\r\ndefect they began to hunt for causes and claimed that such and such a\r\nthing happened to them while they were pregnant, but on close\r\ninvestigation the alleged event was found to have originated in the\r\nmother's brain.\r\n\r\nIn short, while the subject of maternal impressions is an interesting\r\none and demands further investigation, there is at the present time no\r\nscientific justification for the belief in maternal impressions.\r\nParticularly must we scout any stories of maternal impressions during\r\nthe latter part of pregnancy, during the fifth, sixth, seventh,\r\neighth, or ninth month. Because after the child is fully formed no\r\nmental or psychic impressions can make birthmarks on it, amputate its\r\nlimbs, or convert it into any sort of monstrosity.\r\n\r\nAfter the above was written and ready for the printer I came across\r\nfour cases of alleged maternal impressions in a book by Laura A.\r\nCalhoun (\"Sex Determination and Its Practical Application\"). The first\r\nthree cases the author relates without any comment, taking them\r\nevidently for pure coin. The fourth case the lady investigated, and\r\nshe is frank to say that what seemed at first as a clear case of\r\nmaternal impression was nothing of the kind but merely a case of\r\nheredity. In order to break the monotony for a little while I will\r\nreproduce here the four cases in the lady's own words.\r\n\r\n    The first was that of \"a mother who, during pregnancy, was\r\n    obliged for a certain continuous time to eat sheep's flesh. She\r\n    took such a sudden abhorrence and distaste of the meat that she\r\n    only ate it rather than go meat hungry. After the birth of her\r\n    baby she recovered from this spasmodic distaste of this\r\n    particular meat. But the child from its first meat-eating days\r\n    could not endure the smell or the taste of the sheep's flesh.\r\n    Whenever the child attempted to eat that meat, the result was\r\n    always the same--indigestion and want of assimilation, and\r\n    usually attended with acute indigestion cramps.\"\r\n\r\n    In the second case \"another pregnant mother's particular\r\n    'longing' was for mackerel. Her baby was born with what seemed\r\n    to be the outlines, in a brownish color, of a mackerel on its\r\n    side, and which design never faded in after years, and the\r\n    child's ability to eat and digest mackerel was more than\r\n    normal.\"\r\n\r\n    The third case: \"The 'longing' of another pregnant mother was\r\n    for brains to eat. This was provided for her. But as she was\r\n    slowly approaching the dish of deliciously prepared food,\r\n    quivering with delight and with the eagerness of a child to be\r\n    eating it, a cat sprang to the plate and before she could\r\n    prevent it ate the brains and licked the plate clean. She wept\r\n    as a child might have done, and was as unhappy and brokenhearted\r\n    over this fate of the brains food for which she had waited with\r\n    such keen anticipation of satisfaction as a little child might\r\n    have been. Shortly after that the little baby was born, and upon\r\n    one of its shoulder-blades was a representation of the mess of\r\n    brains, designed in brownish outlines, and which did not fade as\r\n    the child grew up.\"\r\n\r\n    The fourth case: \"There lived in a little house in the midst of\r\n    a flower garden, that in its turn gave into a wide-spreading\r\n    orchard, a loving and loyal husband and wife with their\r\n    firstborn child. The wife was now in the first months of\r\n    pregnancy with her second child. Their nearest neighbor was a\r\n    Mexican family, among the members of which was a dashing young\r\n    man of about twenty-two. He and his sister and mother were\r\n    frequent visitors to this little household of three. But the\r\n    young Mexican was the most frequent, and the husband's being\r\n    home or not did not disconcert him. Men of affairs must need\r\n    spend morning hours, and sometimes afternoon hours, too, inside\r\n    of offices, but wealthy and aristocratic young Mexicans ride\r\n    horses all day, decked out with silver, leather, and velvet\r\n    trappings, both horse and rider. It was this lady's custom to\r\n    walk among her flowers and fruit trees. And it became the custom\r\n    of this young caballero to suddenly appear before her during\r\n    these promenades. Her startled eyes would no sooner perceive the\r\n    vision of his blazing, dark eyes fastened upon her, than by one\r\n    pretext and another she made him understand that he was\r\n    dismissed, and would herself retire into the house. When she\r\n    would be about to open a gate, suddenly and unexpectedly the\r\n    young Mexican would appear on the other side and with gracious\r\n    suavity open the gate, always his passionate, dark eyes upon\r\n    her, though his words were reserved and polite. If the husband\r\n    were present, it was still the same. By every means possible he\r\n    would prolong his stay.\r\n\r\n    One summer day this lady was lying on her couch on the veranda,\r\n    sleeping, her eyes covered over. At that time she was having an\r\n    eye malady that was epidemic in that part of the country. She\r\n    heard footsteps approaching, but did not disturb herself, as she\r\n    supposed it was her husband. After some time she suddenly threw\r\n    off the covering from her face, and there to her astonished eyes\r\n    stood the young Mexican, intensely looking down upon her with\r\n    deep concern. At that moment the husband arrived, and the young\r\n    man told him of a weed growing in that locality that he said\r\n    would cure the eye malady. When the leaves of this plant were\r\n    crushed there oozed a yellowish milk; with about a half-dozen\r\n    applications of this milk to the sore eyes they were healed.\r\n\r\n    After that the young caballero would ride up and down, Mexican\r\n    fashion, in front of the house, drawing rein whenever he could\r\n    get a glimpse of the lady or a word with her. This never failed\r\n    to annoy her, and also to strike a sudden, sharp terror into\r\n    her heart. Always his appearance was most unexpected, and\r\n    always accompanied by the rapt, passionate, dark gaze. Though he\r\n    was a most clean-souled young man.\r\n\r\n    Afterward, when the baby was born, one of the child's eyes was\r\n    marked by the color and fire of the dashing Spaniard's eyes,\r\n    while its other eye was a calmish blue-gray eye. This was all\r\n    the more remarkable as neither of the parents of the child had\r\n    such eyes. Was it a case of maternal impression?\r\n\r\n    Upon investigation I found that the grandparents of the baby's\r\n    mother had just such eyes as the baby. The grandfather's were\r\n    big, dark, flashing eyes, and the grandmother's the mild,\r\n    blue-gray eyes. So 'bang!' went the theory of mental impression,\r\n    and in its place came the physical law of reversion.\"\r\n\r\nI do not wish to be misunderstood as claiming that a mother's\r\ncondition during pregnancy has no effect on the child, and that she\r\nneed therefore take no precautions and pay no particular attention to\r\nher health and her feelings. This is not so. But what I do want to\r\nconvey is this: That if a mother's health during pregnancy is bad, if\r\nshe is a prey to worry and anxiety, if she was subjected to great\r\nfright or to a shock, then the child's general health may suffer. It\r\nmay be stillborn, or the mother may have a miscarriage. But it will\r\nnot produce those specific marks, deformities and monstrosities which\r\nare commonly supposed to be the results of maternal impressions.\r\n\r\nIf I lay somewhat special stress upon the subject of maternal\r\nimpressions, it is because I pity the poor mothers and want to spare\r\nthem as much as possible unnecessary worry and anxiety. Besides I want\r\nthem to believe in the truth and not in error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT\r\n\r\nADVICE TO THE MARRIED AND THOSE ABOUT TO BE\r\n\r\n Marriage as an Ideal Institution--Monogamic Marriage--Some Reasons\r\n  for Husbands' Deviations--Importance of First Few Weeks of\r\n  Married Life--Necessity for Understanding at Beginning--\r\n  Preventing and Breaking Habits--The Wife's Individuality--\r\n  Husbands Who are Childish, Not Vicious--Wife's Interest in\r\n  Husband's Affairs--The \"Slob\" Husband--The Well-groomed Husband--\r\n  Bad Odor from the Mouth--Odors from Other Parts of the Body--\r\n  Treatment for Bad Odor from Perspiration--A Beneficial Powder--\r\n  Advice Regarding Flirting--Dainty Underwear--Fine External Clothes\r\n  and Cheap and Soiled Underwear--Delicate Adjustments of Sex Act\r\n  Required with Some Men--Wife Who Discusses Her Husband's Foibles--\r\n  A Professional Secret--A Case of Temporary Impotence--The Wife's\r\n  Indiscretion--The Disastrous Result--A Big Stomach--The Wife's\r\n  Attitude Towards the Marital Relation--Behavior Preliminary to\r\n  and During the Act--Congenital Frigidity--Prudish and Vicious\r\n  Ideas About the Sex Act--Sexual Intercourse for Procreative\r\n  Purposes Only--Fear of Pregnancy on the Part of the Wife--The\r\n  Remedy--Other Causes--Wife who Makes too Frequent Demands--\r\n  Sacrificing the Future to the Present--Esthetic Considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether marriage in its present form is an ideal institution destined\r\nto endure forever, whether it is in need of radical reforms before it\r\ncan be considered ideal, or whether it has fundamental irremediable\r\ndefects, are questions which we are not going to discuss here. The\r\nfact is that at the present time the greatest part of the adult\r\npopulation of the world is married; and the part that isn't would like\r\nto be. And the greater part of civilized humanity living in a state of\r\nmonogamic marriage, it behooves us to make the best of it, to get out\r\nof it the greatest amount of happiness that we can, obviate as much\r\nunhappiness as possible, and to do everything in our power to make it\r\npermanent. Separation or divorce are remedies of last resort, and\r\npeople have recourse to them when they are at the end of their tether.\r\nBut the proper thing to do is to avoid the necessity of having to have\r\nrecourse to them. And I believe that a careful, thoughtful perusal of\r\nthis chapter will help husband and wife to get along better, to avoid\r\nunnecessary friction and to retain the mutual physical and spiritual\r\nattraction which we call Love for a longer period than might otherwise\r\nbe the case.\r\n\r\nI have the confidence and listen to the intimate confessions of more\r\nmen and woman probably than any other physician in America, or perhaps\r\nin the world. For reasons easily understood they tell me things which\r\nthey would not think of telling to their regular physician. I have\r\nlearned of many of the reasons, which in many families led first to a\r\ncoolness, then to an estrangement, or to quarrels, to separation and\r\ndivorce. I know the first steps which in many instances draw the\r\nhusband to another woman. And I wish to tell you, that while I firmly\r\nbelieve in the polygamous or rather varietist tendencies of the\r\naverage man, nevertheless I am convinced that one of the great reasons\r\nwhy so many married men patronize prostitutes, or have mistresses or\r\nlady friends, is to be found in the wives themselves. Many wives\r\n_drive_ their husbands to other women, and are alone responsible for\r\ntheir suffering, for the cooling of their husbands' affections, and\r\nperhaps even desertion. And in the following pages I will endeavor, as\r\nstated before, to point out some of the rocks and shoals on which the\r\nmatrimonial bark is so often shattered, and to offer the wives some\r\nsuggestions which will help them to retain their husbands' affections\r\nand perhaps even also their fidelity.\r\n\r\nWhile the advice is intended primarily for wives, there will be found\r\nhere and there a salutary piece of advice for husbands. Some of the\r\nadvice is applicable to both partners, and as to those suggestions\r\nwhich concern the husband only--it will be a good thing for the wives\r\nto call their husbands' attention to them.\r\n\r\nThe first few weeks or the first few months are the most important in\r\nthe life of a married couple. The stability of the marriage, the\r\nfuture happiness, often depend upon the things which are done or left\r\nundone during the initial weeks of married life. A certain\r\nunderstanding must be reached from the very beginning. If your husband\r\ndoes certain things which displease you and which you know should not\r\nbe done, it is best to say so at the very start. It is easier to\r\nprevent the establishment of a habit than to break a habit after it\r\nhas been established.\r\n\r\n=Retain Your Individuality.= The first piece of advice I have to give\r\nyou is: _Retain your individuality_. It is a trite but perfectly true\r\nobservation that altogether too many men who during courtship were\r\nchivalry personified assume a dictatorial tone as soon as the knot has\r\nbeen tied. They think that the wife has actually ceased to exist as a\r\nseparate human being, that she has been absorbed, and with the loss of\r\nher name she has lost all right to have her own opinions, her own\r\ntastes, and, of course, her own friends. Friends who are obnoxious to\r\none of the marital partners one must give up sometimes; but do not\r\npermit your entire personality to be obscured. Explain to your husband\r\nthat you are still an independent living human being. I do not say,\r\nyou should at once start a fight. Nothing is more offensive to me than\r\nthe militant, pugnacious woman, who wears a chip on the shoulder and\r\nis continually ready to insist on her \"rights.\" But with gentleness\r\nand firmness much can be accomplished. And you want to remember that\r\nmany husbands act the way they do, not because they are vicious, but\r\nbecause they are stupid or childish. Sometimes it is mere\r\nthoughtlessness. They have been brought up wrongly, and some of them\r\nsincerely imagine that by repressing the wife's personality, by\r\nblotting it out, they are acting in her interest. \"It is for her own\r\ngood.\" A serious talk with a husband will sometimes have a wonderful\r\neffect. It may sometimes change entirely the current of his thoughts.\r\nOf course if the husband is a cad, a conceited fool, or a brute, you\r\ncan do nothing with him; but fortunately not all husbands belong to\r\nthose categories.\r\n\r\n=Interest in Husband's Affairs.= Be interested in your husband's\r\naffairs. No matter what your husband's occupation may be, you should\r\npossess enough intelligence to be able to understand what he is doing.\r\nIt is almost unbelievable how little some wives know about their\r\nhusband's profession or work. It is a bad thing when strange women\r\nunderstand your husband's work better than you do, and when he finds\r\nin them more intelligent and more sympathetic listeners. He may go to\r\nthem for sympathy. If your husband is a scientist or a research\r\nworker or a professional man it is not necessary that you be familiar\r\nwith all the details of his work, but with the general character you\r\nshould be. And if you can be of assistance to him in his work, if it\r\nbe only looking up references, compiling tables and statistics or\r\nmerely typewriting, it will be appreciated by him, and will sometimes\r\nhelp to knit the bonds a bit closer.\r\n\r\nThere is another important reason for being interested in and\r\nunderstanding your husband's business. When the husband dies--and a\r\nman is not infrequently snatched away in the prime of youth and\r\nvigor--the wife is often left to the mercies of the cold world,\r\nwithout money and without a profession. If she understands the\r\nhusband's business she can continue it and remain economically\r\nindependent. This has reference not only to ordinary business, like\r\nstores or agencies, but to more or less specialized occupations, such\r\nfor instance as publishing. We know the cases of two widows of\r\npublishers of medical journals. When their husbands died everybody was\r\ncommiserating with them: what will they make a living from? But they\r\nunderstood the details of their husbands' business, and they kept\r\nright on. And now those journals are financially more successful than\r\nthey were when the husbands were at the helm.\r\n\r\n=Wife's Behavior Toward Sexual Relations.= I am now coming to a\r\ndelicate subject. But, delicate though it is, it must be dealt with\r\nunflinchingly, because it is probably responsible for more male\r\ninfidelity than all other causes combined. I speak of the relation of\r\nthe wife to her marital duties, in other words, to sexual relations.\r\nToo many women regard the sexual act as a nuisance, as an ordeal, as\r\nsomething disagreeable to get through with as quickly as possible;\r\nthey regard the husband's demands in this line as an imposition, as\r\nunfair or even as brutal; and their behavior preliminary to and during\r\nthe act is such as to cool the ardor of any refined and sensitive man.\r\nThe reasons for this behavior on the part of many wives are manifold;\r\nthis is not the place to consider them in detail. I will allude to\r\nthem briefly. One great cause is congenital frigidity. The woman is\r\ncold, frigid, has no desire for sex relations and experiences no\r\npleasure, no sensation from them. Such women are not to blame; they\r\nare to be pitied. But even they can behave so as not to repel their\r\nhusbands. (See Chapter XLIII).\r\n\r\nAnother great cause is the vicious, prudish bringing up, by which the\r\nsex act is regarded as something unclean, indecent, animal-like,\r\nbrutal. Such Women need a good \"talking-to,\" and if they are only not\r\nnatural born fools, one good explanation often fixes matters. On a par\r\nwith this general prudishness is the infamous idea promulgated by a\r\nfew semi-insane, mentally decrepit men and women, that sexual\r\nintercourse is for the purpose of propagation only. That only when a\r\nchild is wanted is the relation permissible; at all other times it is\r\na sin, an \"act of prostitution,\" an offense in the eyes of God, etc.,\r\netc. Of course if the wife has such ideas the husband deserves little\r\nsympathy. A man should know what ideas the woman entertains whom he is\r\ngoing to make his wife and the mother of his children. But,\r\nunfortunately, this, the most important subject of sex and sexuality,\r\nis never touched upon by the engaged couple (it would be so\r\nindelicate!), and after they are married they often find themselves at\r\nopposite poles. Here also a good heart-to-heart talk will do a world\r\nof good. I have had several such cases where a little conversation or\r\neven a letter saved the couple from disruption.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the cause of refusal is fear of pregnancy. In this case\r\nthe wife is right. But the remedy is simple: give her full instruction\r\nin the use of contraceptive measures. Other causes are: excessive\r\nmasturbation, vaginismus, local malformation, inflammation, etc. But\r\nwhatever the causes of the wife's \"bad behavior\" may be, they are all\r\namenable to treatment. Some need medical treatment, some psychic\r\ntreatment, and some nothing but just a common-sense, heart-to-heart\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\nAnd I would emphasize: Do not repel your husbands when they ask for\r\nsexual favors--at least do not repel them too often. Households in\r\nwhich relations are had rather frequently and in which the wives lend\r\ntheir full and eager participation are happier households than those\r\nin which the sexual act is indulged in rarely, and with grumbling and\r\nside-remarks on the part of the wife.\r\n\r\nBut of course you should not go to the other extreme either. You\r\nshould not make too frequent demands upon your husband. With a man the\r\nact means a good deal more than it does with a woman; it entails a\r\ngreat deal more of physical and mental exhaustion, and a wife who is\r\nunreasonable in this respect is sowing the seeds of discord and\r\nunhappiness. She is sacrificing the future to the present. The husband\r\nis apt to become afflicted with satiety or impotence--and the wife may\r\nhave to lead a life of continence for much longer than she would have\r\nhad to if she had been moderate. In no department of life is\r\nmoderation so important as in sex life. Non-use, insufficient use and\r\nexcessive use are all bad. A mutually joyful, eager and moderately\r\nfrequent participation in the sexual act will contribute most to a\r\nhappy and long life.\r\n\r\n=Dainty Underwear.= This may be considered too delicate or too\r\ntrifling a subject to discuss in an important sex book. But nothing is\r\ntoo delicate or too trifling that concerns human happiness, and you\r\nwill believe me if I tell you that nice underwear or dainty lingerie\r\nplays a very important role in marital life. And every married woman\r\nshould have as fine and as dainty underwear as she can possibly\r\nafford. A fine or elaborate nightgown may be more important than an\r\nexpensive skirt or hat. Unfortunately too many women ignore this fact.\r\nExternally they will be well dressed, while their petticoats, drawers\r\nand undershirts will be of the commonest quality and of questionable\r\nfreshness and immaculateness. And if anything in a woman's toilet\r\nshould be immaculately fresh and clean it is, I emphasize, her\r\nunderwear. Silk and lace and delicate batiste should be preferred, if\r\nthey can be afforded, and attention should be paid to the color. As a\r\nrule, a delicate pink is the color that most men prefer. The sex act\r\nwith some men requires the most delicate adjustments, and the\r\ncondition of the underwear may determine the man's desire and ability\r\nor inability to accomplish the act. I therefore repeat: whether you\r\nare newly married or have been married a quarter of a century, be\r\nsure that your underwear is the very best that your means will allow\r\nyou, and that it is always sweet, fresh and dainty. It will help you\r\nto retain the affection of your husband. I know that some allegedly\r\nwise ones will scoff at this statement. They may say that an affection\r\nthat may be influenced by the kind and condition of underwear is not\r\nworth having or retaining. But what do these wise ones know! What do\r\nthey know of the numerous subtle influences which gradually either\r\nstrengthen or undermine our affections? Follow this advice and you\r\nwill be grateful.\r\n\r\n=Do Not Offend Against Esthetics.= Some women think that because they\r\nare married to their husbands they owe the latter no esthetic\r\nconsideration. Things that they would be horrified to let a stranger\r\nsee they do before their husband's eyes without hesitation. For\r\ninstance, not to beat about the bush, though the subject is not a\r\npleasant one, they will urinate in their husbands' presence, or they\r\nwill let him see their soiled menstrual napkins, etc. Some husbands\r\nmay not mind it; but some men are very sensitive--men on the whole are\r\nmore esthetic than women--and an indifference towards the wife may\r\nhave its origin in some vulgar or unesthetic procedure on the wife's\r\npart. The sexual act, as mentioned before, is a very delicate\r\nmechanism, and it is very easy to disarrange it. The act of\r\nmicturition before the man is known in many instances to have\r\ninstantly abolished the man's sexual desire which was present before.\r\nAnd a man told me that because he noticed in a closet a lot of rags\r\nsoiled with menstrual blood he was unable to enjoy relations with his\r\nwife for several months. You may think that these are all small\r\nthings, but life is made up of little things, and many a married life\r\nwent smash on account of disregarding the little things.\r\n\r\n=A High Stomach.= Avoid if you possibly can a high stomach, or a big\r\nstomach, or what we call in technical language a pendulous abdomen.\r\nNothing is more fatal to woman's beauty--and to man's love--than a big\r\nstomach, and particularly a hang-down stomach. It at once takes away\r\nher youthfulness and makes her matronly--and matronliness is fatal to\r\nromance. It is not so much general stoutness that is objected to--some\r\nmen, as is well known, prefer plump, stout women. And there are some\r\nsavage tribes in which the preference is given to obese women with\r\nenormous abdomens, but this is not the case with the Caucasian\r\nrace--not in civilized countries, at any rate, and surely not in the\r\nUnited States. First, reduce your carbohydrates, use massage and\r\nhydrotherapy, walk for hours at a time, but reduce your big\r\nabdomen--or, still better, don't let it get big. Prevention here, as\r\nelsewhere, is much better than cure.\r\n\r\n=Bad Odor from the Mouth.= I know of no other physical ailment which\r\nis so dangerous, so fatal to the permanency of the love relation as is\r\na strong, offensive odor from the mouth. As a noxious gas blights a\r\ndelicate plant, so will a strong bad odor blight the delicate plant of\r\nlove. Yes, a strong malodorous whiff will cool the most ardent\r\npassion. The public would be astounded if it knew how many cases of\r\nseparation and divorce are due to nothing else but a bad odor from the\r\nmouth. Therefore, if you happen to suffer from this unfortunate\r\nailment, lose no time in applying to a competent physician, and do not\r\ntire of treating yourself, no matter how irksome and time-consuming\r\nthe treatment may be, until you are completely cured. It is important\r\nto your happiness.\r\n\r\n=Odors from Other Parts of Body.= Odors from other parts of the body\r\nshould be conspicuous by their absence. Normally no artificial aids\r\nare needed. Frequent bathing and general cleanliness are alone\r\nsufficient. The natural feminine odor--_odor feminae_--is pleasant,\r\nattractive and needs no disguise. But where an unpleasant odor from\r\nthe genitals, feet or armpits is present the proper treatment should\r\nbe applied, and in such cases the use of a delicate perfume, sachet\r\nor scented talcum powder, is quite permissible. Not only permissible\r\nbut advisable.\r\n\r\nA very good treatment for perspiration and bad odor from the feet is\r\nthe following: bathe the feet night and morning in a basin of water to\r\nwhich has been added an ounce (two tablespoonfuls) of formaldehyde\r\nsolution. Dry carefully, and then rub in well the following powder. It\r\nis simple, cheap and efficient:\r\n\r\n    Salicylic acid        one dram\r\n    Boric acid            one ounce\r\n    Dried alum            two ounces\r\n    Talcum                four ounces\r\n\r\nA little of the powder should be shaken into the stockings every\r\nmorning, and the stockings should be changed very frequently, once or\r\ntwice a day. This powder is also efficient against perspiration and\r\nbad odor from the armpits.\r\n\r\nI am not giving any treatment for bad odor from the mouth, for this\r\ncondition may be due to a great variety of causes. The cause may\r\nreside in the nose; it may reside in the mouth, decaying teeth,\r\nthroat, tonsils. It may be due to a bad stomach, to some disease of\r\nthe lungs, etc. Sometimes it is due to overeating. What would be of\r\nvalue in one condition might be useless in another. The right thing,\r\ntherefore, is to go to a competent physician, have him find the cause\r\nof your trouble and outline the proper treatment.\r\n\r\nLeucorrhea. Some men find themselves _entirely unable_ to have sexual\r\nrelations with a woman whom they know is suffering with leucorrhea.\r\nThe mere knowledge of the fact takes away their _ability_ to perform\r\nthe act. It renders them impotent. It disgusts them, and disgust is\r\nfatal to sexual power. Only to-day I saw in my office a woman who\r\nanxiously begged for advice and treatment. She had been married five\r\nyears. She has always had leucorrhea, from her fifteenth year as far\r\nas she remembers. Otherwise she did not suffer. For the first three\r\nyears or so her married life has been a happy one. Then in an\r\nunfortunate moment she told her husband about her profuse leucorrhea,\r\nand instantly she noticed a change in him. He could not fully hide the\r\nexpression on his face. And since then he ceased to have intercourse\r\nwith her. He made a few attempts, but they turned out unsatisfactory\r\nto both, and she noticed that he was forcing himself, doing it against\r\nhis will. She took some patent medicines and went to one doctor, but\r\nwithout any results. Now, unless she could be cured, she feared her\r\nhusband would demand a separation or a divorce. If you have leucorrhea\r\ntreat it. And remember you need not initiate your husband in all your\r\nunesthetic ailments.\r\n\r\nLoyalty. Loyalty on the part of the wife is almost as important as\r\nfidelity. And it is in the highest degree disloyal for a wife to talk\r\nto her female or male friends about her husband's peculiarities,\r\nfoibles or weaknesses. The husband's--as well, of course, as the\r\nwife's--peculiarities should be what we call a professional secret.\r\nJust as a physician is forbidden to talk to outsiders about his\r\npatient's troubles, so should a wife not talk about her husband, nor a\r\nhusband about his wife. I know of a case in which a newly married\r\nhusband was temporarily impotent (and it was the wife's fault, too).\r\nShe spoke about it in the deepest confidence to a close girl friend of\r\nhers. The friend told it in deep confidence to another friend. And so\r\nit went around until it reached the husband's ears. From that moment\r\nhe made no further attempt to have relations with his wife; a coolness\r\nresulted, which led to a separation, which still persists. The wife\r\nbegged forgiveness, but he was unable to grant it--he felt so deeply\r\nhurt.\r\n\r\nFlirting. Do not flirt. Men are apt to misunderstand you, and you are\r\napt to get the reputation of a loose woman without in any way having\r\ndeserved it. I do not say that you should always wear a forbidding\r\nexpression, and should scowl at people who dare to smile at you or\r\notherwise pay homage to your feminine charms. But there is a\r\ndifference between a friendly expression and flirting. However, when\r\nyour husband begins to neglect you, then a mild flirtation may be\r\njustifiable. It will _always_ do your husband good to know that there\r\nare other males in the world beside him, and that some of these males\r\nfind interest in the female whom he considers his permanent and\r\nexclusive property.\r\n\r\n=Slovenly Husbands.= Don't let your husband become a slob. That is\r\njust what I mean. It is no use mincing words. Some husbands have never\r\nacquired the habit--or if they have acquired it they quickly lost\r\nit--of regarding their wives as ladies. \"She is not a lady, she is\r\nonly my wife,\" is a well-known joke, but some men take it not as a\r\njest. Some men think that before their wives they can be as slovenly\r\nand unclean as they please. Give your husband to understand that\r\ncleanliness and freshness is not a \"sex-limited\" attribute, and just\r\nas a husband wants his wife to be clean and dainty and well-groomed,\r\nso a wife may enjoy the same qualities in her husband. Some women are\r\nvery fastidious, and while they may say nothing to their husbands for\r\nfear of irritating them, they may think a good deal.\r\n\r\n=Carrying Life Insurance.= Every husband should carry some life\r\ninsurance--as much as he conveniently can. This should be the\r\nhusband's most pleasant duty, particularly so when the wife has no\r\nprofession of her own and there are small children to bring up. The\r\nlack of consideration, the thoughtlessness--I would call it\r\ndishonesty--on the part of many husbands who claim to love their wives\r\nis simply heart-breaking. Who of us does not know of cases of refined\r\nwives with children left absolutely penniless and forced into wage\r\nslavery or even into menial service by the negligence of their\r\nhusbands? Such things happened even to wives whose husbands were\r\nmaking from three to ten thousand a year. Thoughtlessness,\r\ncarelessness, procrastination--and then it was too late. There is not\r\na man who makes as little as twenty dollars a week who cannot carry\r\nsome insurance. I was once poor, very poor. And the terrifying\r\nthought, What would happen to my wife and two children if I should be\r\ntaken off suddenly? gave me many a troubled and sleepless night. And\r\nwhen I took out a thousand dollars insurance I felt some relief. But I\r\nfelt it was inadequate. I therefore made a supreme effort and soon\r\ntook an additional ten thousand dollars. And I assure you that the\r\nannual premium of two hundred and eighty-six dollars was a terrible\r\nburden on me. There were times when I felt as if I had to give it up.\r\nBut I deprived myself of many necessities (there was no question of\r\nluxuries) and I paid my premiums regularly. But in compensation I had\r\nrestful nights. It was soothing to know that if I should be taken away\r\nin my earliest youth my equally young wife and two little babies would\r\nnot be left penniless. I verily believe that an adequate life\r\ninsurance prolongs a person's life, because it removes the worry about\r\nthe future of the wife and children.\r\n\r\nI repeat, every husband should carry some life insurance. And the\r\nhabit of the bridegroom presenting the bride with a substantial life\r\ninsurance policy is a very good one. It is not only a financial\r\nprotection to the wife; it is also more or less a guarantee of the\r\nhusband's fair health.\r\n\r\n=Making a Will.= Another point. Every husband should make a will. This\r\nis a delicate point about which most wives would hesitate to speak to\r\ntheir husbands, but the husband should attend to the matter himself. A\r\nwill doesn't shorten anybody's life, but is very convenient in case of\r\na sudden taking off. This is, of course, particularly important if\r\nthere is some property. If the husband dies without a will, there is\r\nendless trouble and red tape for the wife. An executor has to be\r\nappointed, she has to give bonds, etc., etc. If the husband leaves a\r\nwill making his wife sole executrix, without a bond, all trouble is\r\navoided. I assume, of course, that the husband has perfect confidence\r\nin his wife's wisdom and integrity. If he has not and there are\r\nchildren, it is just as well to designate some outside executor or\r\nexecutors. But whichever may be the case, it is a good and sensible\r\nthing always to have a will properly made out and witnessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY-NINE\r\n\r\nA RATIONAL DIVORCE SYSTEM\r\n\r\n A Rational Divorce System--Storms and Squalls--Two Sides of the\r\n  Divorce Question--Outside Help and Marital Tangles--A Husband who\r\n  was a Paragon of Virtue--The Case of the Sweet Wife--The Proper\r\n  Untangling of Domestic Tangles.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, I am in favor of a rational divorce system. The\r\ndifficulties, the obstacles, the expense, with which divorce is now\r\nsurrounded in most civilized countries is simply disgraceful. Make\r\nmarriage harder and divorce easier, has always been my motto. When\r\nlife together becomes unbearable then it is better for both husband\r\nand wife to cut the tie and to get divorced. Divorce is preferable to\r\nseparation, because both spouses may be able to lead a new and happier\r\nlife. Where there are no children to be taken care of a simple\r\ndeclaration of husband and wife repeated perhaps after a lapse of\r\nthree or six months should be quite sufficient for the granting of a\r\ndivorce. Where there are children the state should make sure that they\r\nwill be properly taken care of before a divorce is granted. Where only\r\none party demands a divorce the case should be carefully studied by a\r\ncommission which should include in its personnel physicians and\r\npsychologists; and adultery should most certainly not be the only\r\ncause for divorce.\r\n\r\nYes, I am for a sensible, rational and easy system of divorce. But I\r\nwould always recommend care and caution. \"Go slow\" should be the\r\nguiding motto of husband and wife in such cases. There are periods in\r\na married couple's life when further living together seems\r\nunthinkable; and still a month or two or a year passes and the husband\r\nand wife live happily together and cannot believe that there was ever\r\nany friction between them. The couples are very few, indeed, who never\r\nwent through any squalls or storms, whose lives were not darkened by\r\ndisagreements, quarrels and apparently irreconcilable antagonisms. But\r\nafter the storm the sun shone brightly again, and the quarrels were\r\nfollowed by harmony and peace. After that love was intensified. Were\r\ndivorce a simple matter, a mere matter of declaration, many couples\r\nwho live now in harmony would have been divorced--to their great\r\nregret perhaps.\r\n\r\nYes, there are two sides to the divorce question. But I would\r\nsummarize it as follows: Where there is a real incompatibility of\r\ncharacters, where there is no love and no respect, then the sooner the\r\ncouple is divorced the better, and not only for them but for the\r\nchildren also, if there are any. An atmosphere of hatred and mutual\r\ncontempt is not a healthy atmosphere for the growing children. But\r\nwhere there is merely irritability, outbreaks of temper, or\r\ndisagreements which if analyzed can be seen to be due to temporary and\r\nremediable causes, then \"Go slow,\" \"Don't hurry,\" should be your\r\nmotto. There will always be time to get a divorce. While if a divorce\r\nhas been obtained, even if you regret it, you will most likely stay\r\ndivorced. Many divorced couples, I imagine, would remarry, if they\r\nwere not ashamed. They fear it would make them ridiculous--and it\r\nwould--in their friends' eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Outsiders in Domestic Tangles=\r\n\r\nIf you have a disagreement with your husband, try to straighten out\r\nthe tangle yourself. Don't call in outside help. You will regret it. A\r\nstranger's paws are too coarse and too unsympathetic to meddle with\r\nthe delicate adjustments which constitute marital life, and after you\r\nhave gotten over your disagreement and are again living harmoniously\r\nyou will be ashamed to look that third party in the face, and you will\r\nprobably bear a grudge against him--or her.\r\n\r\nAltogether outsiders are not fit to mix in the internal differences\r\nbetween husband and wife. It is absolutely impossible for a stranger\r\nto know just where the trouble is and who the guilty party is.\r\nSometimes there is no guilty party. Both husband and wife may be\r\nright; they may both be lovely people and still together they may form\r\nan incompatible, explosive mixture. And then again the party that to\r\noutsiders may seem the angelic one may in reality be the devilish one.\r\nIt is a well-known fact that people who to the outside world may seem\r\nthe personification of honor and good nature may be very devils at\r\nhome. I have long ago given up not only meddling in, but even judging,\r\ndomestic disharmonies. For it is almost impossible for an outsider to\r\njudge justly. I knew a husband who was considered a paragon of virtue.\r\nAnd when a clash came between him and his wife everybody was inclined\r\nto blame the wife. But it came out later that the husband had certain\r\nways about him which made the wife's life a very torture. And vice\r\nversa. I know of another case where the wife was considered the\r\nsweetest thing in the world. She had nice ways about her, but she\r\ndisliked her husband and made his life a hell. With genuine chivalry\r\nhe bore everything, believing that it was a man's duty to bear his\r\ncross. She was unfaithful to him, but she was so clever and cunning\r\nthat neither he nor anybody else suspected it. The fact became\r\npainfully patent to him, when on one of the rare occasions that they\r\ncame together she infected him with a venereal disease, which\r\nincapacitated him for a long time. Nobody knew why he insisted upon a\r\nseparation, and everybody, with the exception of his physician and\r\nperhaps one or two others, was blaming him for an unfeeling brute.\r\n\r\nI will therefore repeat that as a general thing domestic tangles\r\nshould be untangled by the tanglers themselves. It is not safe to call\r\nin outsiders--relatives or friends; they are apt to make the tangle\r\nmore tangled, and, what is more, they are quite likely to put the\r\nblame on the innocent party, and bestow upon the guilty party the\r\nMontyon prize for virtue and gentleness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY\r\n\r\nWHAT IS LOVE?\r\n\r\n Is Love Definable?--Raising a Corner of the Veil--Two Opinions of\r\n  Love--The First Opinion: Sexual Intercourse and Love--The Second\r\n  Opinion--The Grain of Truth in Each--The Truth Concerning\r\n  Love--Foundation of Love--Sexual Attraction and Love--The Frigid\r\n  Woman and Her Husband--Puzzling Cases of Love--The\r\n  Paradox--Blindness of Love and the Penetrating Vision of\r\n  Love--Limits of Homeliness--Physical Aversion and Genesis of\r\n  Love--Mating in the Animal Kingdom--Mating in Low Races--Love in\r\n  People of High Culture--Difference in Love of Savage and Man of\r\n  Culture--Distinctions Between Loves--Varieties of Love and\r\n  Varieties of Men--\"Love\" Without Sexual Desire--Refraining and\r\n  Wanting--Cause of Love at First Sight--\"Magnetic Forces\" and Love\r\n  at First Sight--The Pathological Side--Differentiation of Phases\r\n  of Love--Infatuation--Difference Between \"Infatuation\" and \"Being\r\n  in Love\"--Sexual Satisfaction and Infatuation--Sexual\r\n  Satisfaction and Love--Infatuation Mistaken for Love--Love the\r\n  Most Mysterious of Human Emotions--Great Love and Supreme\r\n  Happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to give a definition, either brief or extensive,\r\nof Love. Many have tried and failed, and I shall not attempt the\r\nimpossible. Nor shall I attempt to discuss Love in all its innumerable\r\ndetails.[9] To do so would alone require a book many times more\r\nvoluminous than the one you have before you. I shall, however,\r\nendeavor to raise a corner of the veil which surrounds this most\r\nmysterious, most baffling and most complex of all human emotions, so\r\nthat you may get a glimpse into its intricate mechanism and perhaps\r\nunderstand what Love is in its essence at least.\r\n\r\n=Sexual and Platonic Love.= There are two widely different, in fact\r\ndiametrically opposite, opinions as to what constitutes Love. One\r\nopinion is that Love is sexual love, sexual attraction, sexual desire.\r\nTo people holding this opinion love and sexual desire or \"lust\" are\r\nsynonymous. And they laugh and sneer at any attempt to idealize love,\r\nto present it as something finer and subtler, let alone nobler, than\r\nmere sex attraction. The writer has heard one cynical woman--and more\r\nthan one man--say: Love? There is no such a thing. Sexual intercourse\r\nis love, and that's all there is to it.\r\n\r\nThe other opinion is that Love, true love, ideal love, or, as it is\r\nsometimes called, sentimental love, or platonic love, has nothing to\r\ndo with sexual desire, with sexual attraction. Indeed, people holding\r\nthis opinion consider love and sexual attraction--or lust as they like\r\nto call the latter--as antithetical conceptions, as mutually\r\nantagonistic and exclusive.\r\n\r\nBoth opinions, as is often the case with extreme and one-sided\r\nopinions, are wrong. Both opinions have a reason for their existence,\r\nbecause there is a grain of truth in both of them. But a grain of\r\ntruth is not the whole truth, and if an opinion contains ninety-nine\r\nparts of untruth to one part of truth, then the effect of the opinion\r\nis practically the same as if it were all false.\r\n\r\nHere is the truth, or at least what I think is the truth, as it\r\nappears to me after many years of thinking and many years of\r\nobserving.\r\n\r\n=Foundation of Love.= The _foundation_, the _basis_ of all love is\r\nsexual attraction. Without sexual attraction, in greater or lesser\r\ndegree, there can be no love. Where the former is entirely lacking the\r\nlatter can have no existence. This you may take as an axiom. Some may\r\ncall it love, but on analyzing it you will find that it is no such\r\nthing. It may be friendship, it may be gratitude, it may be respect,\r\nit may be pity, it may be habit, it may even be a _desire_ or a\r\n_readiness_ to love or to be loved, but it is not love. Experience has\r\nproved it in thousands and thousands of sad cases. And the girl who\r\nmarries a man who is physically repulsive to her, who possesses _no_\r\nphysical sexual attraction for her, though she may experience for him\r\nall of the feelings mentioned above, namely, friendship, gratitude,\r\nrespect and pity, is preparing for herself a joyless couch to sleep\r\non. Unless, indeed, she happens to belong to the class of women whom\r\nwe call frigid, that is, if she is herself devoid of any sexual desire\r\nand feels no need of any sexual relations. Such a woman may be fairly\r\nor even quite happy with a husband who repels her physically, but whom\r\nshe likes or respects. And what I said about the wife applies with\r\nstill greater force to the husband. A man who marries a woman who is\r\nphysically antipathetic to him is a criminal fool.\r\n\r\nI repeat, sexual, physical attraction is the _basis_, the foundation\r\nof love. It is true we see certain cases of love which puzzle us. We\r\ncannot understand what \"he\" has seen in \"her\" or what \"she\" has seen\r\nin \"him.\" But let us remember this paradox, which paradoxical though\r\nit be, is true nevertheless: Love is blind, but Love also sees acutely\r\nand penetratingly; it sees things which we who are indifferent cannot\r\nsee. The blindness of Love helps her not to see certain defects which\r\nare clearly seen to everybody else; but, on the other hand, her\r\npenetrating vision helps her to see good qualities which are invisible\r\nto others. And a homely person may possess certain compensating\r\n_physical_ qualities--such as passionate ardor or strong sexual\r\npower--which, render him or her irresistible to a member of the\r\nopposite sex.\r\n\r\nBut homeliness, ugliness or deformity have their limits, and I\r\nchallenge anybody to bring forth an authenticated case in which a man\r\nfell in love with a woman--or vice versa--who had an enormous tumor on\r\none side of the face, which made her look like a monstrosity, or whose\r\nnose was sunk in as a result of lupus or syphilis, or whose cheek was\r\neaten away by cancer. Love under such circumstances is an absolute\r\nimpossibility, because there is physical aversion here, and physical\r\naversion is fatal to the _genesis_ of love. A man who loved a woman\r\nmay continue to love her after she has become disfigured by disease,\r\nbut he cannot fall in love with such a woman.\r\n\r\nI will repeat, then, and I trust you will agree with me on this point:\r\nsexual attraction is the foundation of all love between the opposite\r\nsexes. Where sexual attraction is lacking you can give the feeling any\r\nother name you choose: it will not be love.\r\n\r\n=Other Requisites.= But a foundation is not a whole structure. To\r\ninsure the stability of a high intricate building we must give it a\r\ngood solid foundation; but the foundation does not make the building.\r\nThat still remains to be built. So sexual attraction is the foundation\r\nof all love, but it does _not_ constitute love. Many more factors,\r\nmany more wonderful stones are needed before the wonderful structure\r\ncalled love is brought into existence. This wonderful structure\r\nsometimes goes up in the twinkling of an eye, as if by the touch of a\r\nmagic wand--who has not seen or heard of instances of \"love at first\r\nsight!\"--but the rapidity of the growth of the structure called Love\r\ndoes not militate against our assertion that many stones, much\r\nvariegated material, and a strong cement are needed for its\r\ncompletion. Fairies sometimes work very quickly.\r\n\r\nA little thought will show clearly that Love is not merely sexual\r\nlove, not merely a desire to gratify the sexual instinct. If love were\r\nmerely sexual desire, then one member of the opposite sex, or at least\r\none attractive member, would be as good as any other. And indeed in\r\nanimals and in the lower races, where love as we understand it does\r\nnot exist, this is the case. To a male dog any female dog is as good\r\nas another, and vice versa. Cats are not particular in the choice of\r\ntheir mates, nor are cows, horses, etc. And the same is true of the\r\nprimitive savage races, and even among the lower uneducated classes of\r\nso-called civilized races. To the Hottentot, to the Australian bushman\r\nor to the Russian peasant one woman is as good as another. If the male\r\nof a low race has some preference, it will be in favor of the woman\r\nwho happens to have a little property.\r\n\r\nIn fact I make the assertion that real love, true love, is a new\r\nfeeling, a comparatively modern feeling, absent in the lower races and\r\nreaching its highest development only in people of high civilization,\r\nculture and education.\r\n\r\nThe platitudinous objection might be raised that \"human nature is\r\nhuman nature,\" that all our feelings are born with us, and as such are\r\ninherited, that they have been with us for millions of years and that\r\nwe cannot possibly _originate_ any entirely new feeling. True from a\r\ncertain viewpoint. We cannot originate intellect either. The germ of\r\nintellect with all its potential possibilities was present in our most\r\nprimitive tree-climbing ancestors. But as much difference as there is\r\nbetween the intellect of an Australian bushman and the intellect of a\r\nSpinoza, a Shakespeare, a Darwin, a Victor Hugo, a Goethe or a Gauss,\r\nso much difference is there between the love of a primitive savage and\r\nthe love of the highly cultured modern man. The love or so-called love\r\nof the primitive or ignorant man (and woman) is a simple matter and is\r\npractically equivalent to a desire for sexual gratification. The love\r\nof the truly cultured and highly civilized man and woman, while still\r\n_based_ on sexual attraction, is so complex and so dominating a\r\nfeeling that it completely defies all analysis, all attempts at\r\ndissection, as it defies all attempts at synthesis, at artificial\r\nbuilding up.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, some writers attempt to make a clear distinction\r\nbetween sensual and sentimental love; many reams of paper have been\r\nused up in an endeavor to differentiate between one and the other; the\r\nfirst is called animal love or lust; the second pure love or ideal\r\nlove; the first variety of love is said to be selfish, egotistic, the\r\nother--self-sacrificing, altruistic. These distinctions read very\r\nnicely, but they mean very little. There is no distinct line of\r\ndemarkation between the two varieties of love, and one merges\r\nimperceptibly into the other. Most, if not all, of our apparently\r\naltruistic actions and feelings have an egotistic substratum; and the\r\nquality of the love depends upon the lover. In other words, there are\r\nnot two separate, distinct varieties of love, but there are separate,\r\ndistinct varieties of men. A fine and noble man will love finely and\r\nnobly; a coarse and brutal man will love coarsely and brutally. A man\r\nwho is fine and noble may not love at all, but he cannot love coarsely\r\nand selfishly; and a coarse and brutal man can never love nobly and\r\nunselfishly. Which once more means: the difference is not inherent in\r\nthe love, but in the lover.\r\n\r\nBut to say that a man may deeply love a woman and not have any sexual\r\ndesire for her is nonsense. A man who loves a woman and does not want\r\nto possess her (to use the ugly ancient verb) does not love her--or\r\nhe is completely impotent. Whatever the feeling may be for her--it is\r\nnot love. He may abstain from having sex relations with her if the\r\ncircumstances are such that sex relations may lead to her unhappiness\r\nand suffering, but to refrain from doing a thing, when reason and\r\njudgment lead us to refrain, does not mean not to want the thing.\r\n\r\n=Love at First Sight.= Nothing is more firmly established than the\r\nfact that a person may fall passionately and incurably in love with a\r\nperson of the opposite sex at the very first sight, in the twinkling\r\nof an eye, in the literal sense of the word. One glance may be\r\nsufficient. And such a love may exist to the end of life, and may, if\r\nreciprocated, lead to supreme happiness, or if unreciprocated to the\r\ndeepest unhappiness.\r\n\r\nWhat it is that causes love at first sight is unknown. Some have\r\nsuggested that the beloved object sets in motion or fermentation\r\ncertain internal secretions (hormones) in the lover which cannot\r\nbecome \"satisfied\" or \"neutralized\" except by that person; and the\r\npossession of the beloved object becomes a physical necessity. This\r\nexplanation really means nothing. It is a hypothesis unsusceptible of\r\nproof. But whatever the cause of love at first sight, it is so\r\nmysterious a phenomenon that it gives the mystics and metaphysicians\r\nsome justification for their talk about \"electric currents\" and\r\n\"magnetic forces.\" These phrases also mean nothing, but are an attempt\r\nat explaining the suddenness and irresistibleness of the attack. So\r\npowerful is the attraction of love at first sight that people have\r\nbeen known to cross continents and oceans merely to get a glimpse of\r\nthe beloved object; and people have been known to sacrifice\r\n_everything_--their career, their material possessions, their social\r\nstanding, their honor, and even their wife and children, in order to\r\ngain their object. And a mother may give up her children whom she\r\nloves dearer than life, may risk ostracism and disgrace, only in order\r\nto be with the object of her love. This shows that love, then, becomes\r\npathological, because any feeling which so completely masters an\r\nindividual that he is willing to sacrifice everything he has in the\r\nworld is pathological.\r\n\r\n=Infatuation and Being in Love.= While, as said, the feeling of love\r\ndoes not readily lend itself to dissection, to analysis, still we can\r\ndifferentiate some phases of it. We can differentiate between \"being\r\nin love,\" \"infatuation,\" and \"love.\" Being in love is, as just\r\nindicated, a pathological, morbid phenomenon. The person who is in\r\nlove is not in a normal condition. He can see nothing, he cannot be\r\nargued with, as far as his love is concerned. She is the acme of\r\nperfection, physical, mental, and spiritual; nobody can be compared\r\nwith her. And, of course, the man is anxiously eager to marry the\r\nobject of his love--unless insuperable obstacles are in the way; for\r\ninstance, if the man happens to be married.\r\n\r\nInfatuation may be as strong as any \"being in love\" feeling. But with\r\nthis difference. In infatuation the man may know that the object of\r\ninfatuation is an unworthy one, he may despise her, he may hate her,\r\nhe may pray for her death, he may do his utmost to overcome the\r\ninfatuation. In short, infatuation is a feeling, chiefly physical,\r\nwhich the man can analyze, the unworthiness and absurdity of which he\r\nmay acknowledge, but which he is unable to resist or overcome. He\r\nfeels himself bewitched; he feels himself caught in a net, he is\r\nanxious to tear asunder the meshes of the net, but is not strong\r\nenough to do it.\r\n\r\nAnd this is a pretty good way to differentiate between being in love\r\nand being infatuated. If in love the man does not want to be free from\r\nhis chains; he does not want to cease to love or to be in love. When\r\ninfatuated the man often uses his utmost will-power to break his\r\nshackles. Sexual satisfaction is often sufficient to shatter an\r\ninfatuation; it is not sufficient to destroy love--it often\r\nstrengthens and eternalizes it.\r\n\r\nNeither being in love nor infatuation can last \"forever\"; they are\r\nacute maladies of high tension and relatively short duration.\r\nInfatuation may change into indifference or disgust; \"being in love\"\r\nmay change into indifference, hatred, or into real love--a steady,\r\ndurable love.\r\n\r\nThis will answer the often asked question: How do marriages turn out\r\nwhich are the result of a sudden, violent passion, or of love at first\r\nsight? No ironclad rules suitable for all cases can be given. Some\r\nturn out very unhappily, the couple gradually finding out that they\r\nare altogether unsuited to each other, that their temperaments are\r\nincompatible, that their views, ideas, likes and dislikes are\r\ndifferent. In some cases what was supposed to be a great love is soon\r\nseen to have been merely an infatuation. And satiety and disgust\r\nfollow. But in other cases, as mentioned, the sudden consuming passion\r\nturns into a warm, life-long love and the people live happily ever\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nDr. Nystroem relates the case of a prominent physician of France, of\r\nhigh social and scientific standing, who beheld a young girl\r\naccidentally in the street. He did not have the slightest idea who she\r\nwas. He was irresistibly attracted to her. He followed her, boarded\r\nthe same omnibus and went to the house which she entered, rang the\r\nbell, introduced himself, begging pardon for his intrusion, but was\r\ndismissed. He returned and explained to her his ardent passion and\r\nasked permission to visit her parents, well-to-do people in the\r\ncountry, and the climax was a mutual love and a happy marriage.\r\n\r\nMany of us know of similar cases. But as a rule the slow developing\r\nlove is more reliable than the suddenly bursting out flame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLove is the most complex, the most mysterious, the most unanalyzable\r\nof human emotions. It is based upon the difference in sex--upon the\r\nattraction of one sex for another. It is fostered by physical beauty,\r\nby daintiness, by a normal sexuality, by a fine character, by high\r\naspirations, by culture and education, by common interests, by\r\nkindness and consideration, by pity, by habit and by a thousand other\r\nsubtle feelings, qualities and actions, which are difficult of\r\nclassification or enumeration.\r\n\r\nA great love, greatly reciprocated, is in itself capable of rendering\r\na human being supremely happy. _Nothing else is._ Other things, such\r\nas wealth, power, fame, success, great discoveries, may give supreme\r\nsatisfaction, great contentment, but supreme, buoyant happiness is the\r\ngift of a great love only. Such loves are rare, and the mortals that\r\nachieve it are the envy of the gods. But a great love, unreciprocated,\r\nespecially when admixed to it is the feeling of jealousy, is the most\r\nfrightful of tortures; it will crush a man like nothing else will, and\r\nthe victims of this emotional catastrophe are pitied by the inmates of\r\nthe lowest inferno.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] To avoid confusion, I will state here that I am discussing love\r\nbetween the opposite sexes, and not maternal love, homosexual love,\r\nlove for one's country, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY-ONE\r\n\r\nJEALOUSY AND HOW TO COMBAT IT\r\n\r\n Jealousy the Most Painful of Human Emotions--Impairment of\r\n  Health--Mental Havoc--Jealousy as a Primitive Emotion--Jealousy\r\n  in the Advanced Thinker and in the Savage--Jealousy in the\r\n  Child--Feelings and Environmental Factors--Essential Factors--\r\n  Vanity--Anger--Pain--Envy--The Impotent Husband's Jealousy--\r\n  Anti-social Qualities--The Jealous and the Unfaithful Husband--\r\n  Means of Eradicating the Evil--Iwan Bloch on the Question--Prof.\r\n  Robert Michels' Statement--Remark of Prof. Von Ehrenfels--Havelock\r\n  Ellis on Variation in Sexual Relationships--Advanced Ideas--Woman\r\n  as Man's Chattel--The Change and the Changer--Teaching the\r\n  Children--Casting Epithets at Jealousy--Free Unions and Jealousy--\r\n  Feelings, Actions and Public Opinion--The Adulterous Wife of the\r\n  Present Day--Jealousy Defeating Its Own Object--Jealousy of\r\n  Inanimate Objects.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe or she who has been so unfortunate as to experience the pangs--or\r\nfangs--of jealousy will readily admit that it is one of the most\r\npainful, if indeed _not_ the most painful, of all human emotions. The\r\nsuffering that it metes out to its victims is indescribable. No other\r\nsingle human emotion so affects the body, so upsets the mind, so\r\nderanges every function, as does jealousy. The torture that it causes\r\nmakes the sufferer a truly pitiable object: the complete loss of sleep\r\nand complete loss of appetite may result in a serious impairment of\r\nthe sufferer's health, while the rage it often gives rise to may lead\r\nto actual insanity, or at least to great mental disturbance. With good\r\nreason has popular fancy pictured this cursed emotion as a green-eyed\r\nmonster.\r\n\r\nJealousy is a primitive emotion. It is present not only in the\r\nprimitive races, but even in animals. And being a primitive emotion,\r\nwe can hardly hope to succeed in eradicating it entirely. Not in the\r\nimmediate future, at any rate. But we can modify it.\r\n\r\nThe statement frequently heard that \"human nature is human nature\" is\r\nonly a platitudinous half-truth. The fundamental part of human\r\nnature--the desire for happiness and the avoidance of suffering--cannot\r\nbe changed, nor would we want to change it if we could. It would mean\r\nthe disappearance of the human race. But that many of our primitive\r\nemotions can be greatly modified by culture, by new standards, by new\r\nideals of morality, about this there can be no question.\r\n\r\nJust as love in modern man is an entirely different feeling from what\r\nit was in primitive man, so jealousy in the advanced thinker is a\r\ndifferent feeling from what it was in the savage; and by education and\r\ntrue culture it can be modified still further. We hope that in time to\r\ncome--I will not venture to say how soon that time will be here--this\r\ninjurious, degrading, anti-social feeling may be entirely or almost\r\nentirely eradicated from the human breast.\r\n\r\nThe primitive desire--and this primitive desire of the race is still\r\nfully exhibited by children--is to take possession of everything nice\r\nor useful that somebody else has and which we have not. But our\r\neducation and our cultural standards, including fear of punishment,\r\nhave so repressed this desire, have put it so deeply in the\r\nbackground, that normal human beings hardly feel it at all.\r\n\r\nIt is only improperly brought up people, mental defectives and those\r\nunable to adjust themselves to their environment who still have this\r\nprimitive feeling of taking or stealing. And so with many other\r\nfeelings and emotions; and so with jealousy.\r\n\r\nIf we, at the very first notice of a manifestation of jealousy by a\r\nchild, should frown upon it, if we should explain to the child or\r\nadolescent that jealousy is a mean, degrading feeling, that it is a\r\nfeeling to be ashamed of, a feeling to hide and not to show off or\r\neven be proud of--as some are now--then jealousy would manifest itself\r\nin a much smaller number of individuals, and those unfortunate enough\r\nto be attacked by it would try to repress it, to hide it, to overcome\r\nit, so that it would eventually become paler and less acute and its\r\nconsequences would be less significant, less disastrous for both the\r\nvictim and for the persons concerned. Feelings, let us bear in mind,\r\nare not spontaneous things uninfluenced by any environmental factors.\r\nFeelings are like plants; under one environment you may foster their\r\ngrowth and make them develop luxuriantly; under another environment\r\nyou may dwarf their growth and strangle them.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable us to inhibit the growth of the demon of jealousy,\r\nwe must learn what its essence is and what factors are favorable to\r\nits development.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Causes of Jealousy=\r\n\r\nThe essential factor in jealousy is _fear_. Fear of losing the beloved\r\nobject, fear of losing the person who provides you with sexual\r\nsatisfaction, or the mere economic fear of losing a material provider.\r\nThe latter kind of fear is, of course, more often manifested--even\r\nthough unconsciously--in women. Women who have no love for their\r\nhusbands are nevertheless often fiercely jealous, because consciously\r\nor unconsciously they are afraid that their husbands may desert them\r\nfor other women, and that they may thus find themselves in a\r\nprecarious economic condition.\r\n\r\nAnother factor in jealousy is wounded _vanity_. We do not like to feel\r\nthat somebody is considered superior to us. This feeling of wounded\r\nvanity is present in other varieties of envy or rivalry. A person who\r\nloses in a race or gets a lower mark in his examination than his rival\r\nmay be filled with a feeling of envy and hatred almost equal in\r\nintensity to, though never as painful as, sexual jealousy.\r\n\r\nAnother factor in jealousy is _anger_ over loss of what we consider\r\nour property. In our present social order the man considers his wife\r\nhis absolute property, and so does the wife consider her husband. And\r\nthere is anger that a stranger should dare to rob us or make use of\r\nour property, just as there would be anger if a thief came and robbed\r\nus of a valuable material possession. This anger or rage part of\r\njealousy is not a sign of love. It is very far from being so. Because\r\nit manifests itself also in men and women who have not a particle of\r\nlove for their spouses; it manifests itself in spouses who have\r\nnothing but hatred and loathing for their partners.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor is _pain_, pain that the person we love has\r\nceased to love us. When we love a person and our love is not\r\nreciprocated, we feel pain which may rise to the degree of agony, even\r\nwhen there is no rival in the field. But when a person who loved us\r\nhas ceased to love us--or we imagine so--and has transferred the love\r\nto another person that pain is so much the greater.\r\n\r\nI will digress here for a moment to state that the fear that a person\r\nhas ceased to love us because he loves somebody else is often\r\ngroundless. It is based upon the erroneous and vicious idea that a man\r\ncannot possibly love two women at the same time, or that a woman\r\ncannot love two men at the same time. Psychologists, particularly\r\nthose who have made a special study of sexual psychology, know that\r\nthis idea is false. They know that love may be directed at the same\r\ntime towards two or three individuals. They know that a second love\r\nnot only does not necessarily destroy or diminish a first love, but\r\nmay deepen and strengthen the latter.\r\n\r\nAnother element is pure _envy_. Just mean envy that somebody should\r\nhave what we haven't, or what we have but are in danger of losing.\r\nJust as we envy others an automobile, a fine house, a high social\r\nposition, etc., when we have not got them or have been deprived of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA point that I would like to mention is, that if husbands who have\r\nbecome impotent--having lost either the desire or the power, but\r\nparticularly the latter--become jealous, their jealousy knows no\r\nbounds. No strongly potent man ever reaches the same intensity in\r\njealousy as is reached by a sexually weak or impotent man. The\r\nknowledge that another man has displaced him and that he himself could\r\nnot replace that other man _even if he were permitted to_ fills him\r\nwith impotent rage; and, as is well known, impotent rage is always\r\nmore intense than rage that is potent. Women are free from this kind\r\nof rage, because women are never impotent in this sense. (They may be\r\nfrigid, but they are never devoid of the _potentia coeundi_, except in\r\nextremely rare cases of _atresia vaginae_ or the absence of the\r\nexternal genitals.)\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other components which go to make up this \"queen\r\nof torments\" or \"king of torturers\" jealousy, but those I have\r\nenumerated are the essential ones.\r\n\r\nWhat are they? Fear, vanity, anger, envy and pain. None of them\r\nadmirable qualities, none of them, with the exception of the first and\r\nthe last, even deserving our compassion. All of them anti-social and\r\nanti-individual qualities. Should not everything be done to eradicate\r\nsuch a rank weed, which draws its sustenance from roots each one of\r\nwhich is dipped in poison?\r\n\r\nWe are told that in our primitive state jealousy was a social\r\ninstinct; that by killing and keeping away rivals it helped to found\r\nand cement the family and to keep it pure. I do not care to enter\r\nhere into a discussion of this point. But whatever useful role\r\njealousy may have played in the remote ages (I doubt that it has), it\r\nis now an utterly useless, utterly vicious, utterly anti-social and\r\nanti-individual emotion. It is opposed to social life and it destroys\r\nindividual happiness. And everything possible should be done to\r\nsmother it, to strangle it, to eliminate it entirely from human life.\r\n\r\nYes, I find no compensation whatever for jealousy; I find no place for\r\nit in our modern life and I am in complete agreement with Forel, who\r\ncalls jealousy \"a heritage of animals and barbarians.\" \"That is what I\r\nwould say,\" he says, \"to all those who, in the name of offended honor,\r\nwould grant it rights and even place it on a pedestal. It is ten times\r\nbetter for a woman to marry an unfaithful than a jealous husband....\r\nJealousy transforms marriage into a hell.... Even in its more moderate\r\nand normal form, jealousy is a torment, for distrust and suspicion\r\npoison love. We often hear of justified jealousy. I maintain that\r\n_jealousy is never justifiable_; it is always a stupid, atavistic\r\ninheritance, or else a pathological symptom.\"\r\n\r\nBut can anything be done to eradicate this agonizing, tormenting\r\nemotion? I believe it can, and the ways and means to the eradication\r\nof this evil will be found on analyzing its components. We may not be\r\nable to destroy all the components; if we destroy the greater part of\r\nthem much will have been accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe underlying factors of jealousy are: the primitive instinct, also\r\npresent in many animals, our ethical and religious ideas and our\r\neconomic system. The primitive instinct we can repress and modify; we\r\ncan hardly hope to eradicate it entirely. But our ideas and economic\r\nsystem we can change. It is easier to change ideas than it is a\r\nsystem, and it is with our ideas we should commence.\r\n\r\nThe first idea we must endeavor to destroy is that it is impossible\r\nfor a human being to love more than one other human being at the same\r\ntime. We must show that the love of the modern educated and esthetic\r\nman and woman is an exceedingly complex feeling, and that a man may\r\ndeeply and sincerely love one woman for certain qualities and just as\r\ndeeply and sincerely love another woman for certain other qualities.\r\nOf course, love cannot be measured by the yard or bushel, nor can it\r\nbe weighed on the most delicate chemical balance. And it may be\r\nimpossible to determine whether he loves both women exactly alike or\r\nhe loves one woman more than the other. But that one love does not\r\nexclude another, that it may even intensify the other love, that is\r\ncertain, and is the opinion of every advanced sexologist.\r\n\r\nMax Nordau, a man of high and austere ideals, a man whom nobody will\r\naccuse of a tendency to licentiousness, says in his Conventional Lies:\r\n\"It may sound very shocking, yet I must say it: we can even love\r\n_several_ individuals at the same time, with nearly equal tenderness,\r\nand we do not necessarily lie when we assure each one of our passion.\r\nNo matter how deeply we may be in love with a certain individual, we\r\n_do not cease_ to be susceptible to the influence of the entire sex.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Iwan Bloch, than whom no greater investigator in the field of\r\nsexology ever lived, asks the question: \"Is it possible for any one to\r\nbe _simultaneously_ in love with several individuals?\" And he\r\nimmediately says: \"I answer this question with an unconditional\r\n'yes.'\" And he says further: \"It is precisely the extraordinary\r\nmanifold spiritual differentiation of modern civilized humanity that\r\ngives rise to the possibility of such a simultaneous love for two\r\nindividuals. Our spiritual nature exhibits the most varied coloring.\r\nIt is difficult always to find the corresponding complements in one\r\nsingle individual.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Robert Michels says: \"It is Nature's will that the normal male\r\nshould feel a continuous and powerful sexual attraction towards a\r\nconsiderable number of women.... In the male the stimuli capable of\r\narousing sexual excitement (this term is not to be understood here in\r\nthe grossly physical sense) are so extraordinarily manifold, so widely\r\ndifferentiated that it is quite impossible for one single woman to\r\npossess them all.\"\r\n\r\nProf. von Ehrenfels wittily remarks that if it were a moral precept\r\nthat a man should never have intercourse _more them once in his life_\r\nwith any particular woman, this would correspond far better with the\r\nnature of the normal male and would cost him far less will-power than\r\nis needed by him in order to live up to the conventional demands of\r\nmonogamy.\r\n\r\nAnd Havelock Ellis cautiously says: \"A certain degree of variation is\r\ninvolved in the sexual relationships, as in all other relationships,\r\nand unless we are to continue to perpetuate _many evils and\r\ninjustices_, that fact has to be faced and recognized.\"\r\n\r\nI have devoted considerable space to this topic, and I have, contrary\r\nto my custom, quoted \"authorities,\" because I consider this point of\r\nthe utmost importance; it is the first step in combating the demon of\r\njealousy. If our wives, fiancees and sweethearts could be convinced of\r\nthe truth that a man's interest in or even affection towards another\r\nmember of the female sex does not mean the death of love, or even\r\ndiminished love, half of the battle would be won. Half of the misery,\r\nhalf of the quarrels, half of the self-torture, half of the disrupted\r\nhomes, in short, half of the tyrannical reign of the demon of\r\njealousy, would be gone.\r\n\r\nWe must teach our women and men this truth, teach it from puberty on.\r\nWe must show them that not every woman can necessarily fill out a\r\nman's entire life, that not every woman can necessarily occupy every\r\nnook and corner of a man's mind and heart, and that there is nothing\r\nhumiliating to the woman in such an idea (and _vice versa_). She\r\nshould be taught to find nothing shameful, painful or degrading in\r\nsuch a thought. I know that these ideas are somewhat in advance of the\r\ntimes, but if nobody ever brought forward any advanced ideas because\r\nthey were advanced there would never be any advance.\r\n\r\nThen we must teach our men that when they marry a woman she does not\r\nbecome their chattel, their piece of property, which nobody may touch,\r\nnobody may look at or smile at. A woman may be a very good, faithful\r\nwife and still enjoy the companionship of other men, the pressure of\r\nanother man's hand or--_horribile dictu_--even an occasional kiss.\r\n\r\nThen we must teach our men _and_ women that there is essentially\r\nnothing shameful or humiliating in being displaced by a rival. The\r\nchange may be a disgrace for the changer and not for the changed one.\r\nIt does not at all mean that the change has been made because the\r\nrival is superior; it is a well-known fact that the rival often _is_\r\ninferior. The change is often made, not because the changer has gone\r\nupward, but because he has gone downward, has deteriorated. And the\r\nchanger often knows it himself.\r\n\r\nInculcating those ideas would do away with the feeling of wounded\r\nvanity which is such an important component in the feeling of\r\njealousy.\r\n\r\nFurther, we must teach our children from the earliest age that\r\njealousy is \"not nice,\" that it is a mean feeling, that it is a sign\r\nof weakness, that it is degrading to the person who entertains it,\r\nparticularly to the person who exhibits it. Ideas inculcated from\r\nchildhood have a powerful influence, and the various ideas exposed\r\nabove _would_ have an undoubted influence in minimizing the mephitic,\r\ndestructive effects of the feeling of jealousy. People properly\r\nbrought up will always succeed in controlling or suppressing certain\r\nnon-vital instincts or emotions on which society puts its stamp of\r\ndisapproval, which it considers \"not nice\" or disgraceful.\r\n\r\nI am, therefore, an optimist in relation to the eventual uprooting of\r\nthe greater number of components of the anti-social feeling of\r\njealousy. And when woman reaches economic independence, then another\r\ncomponent of the instinct of jealousy--the terror at losing a provider\r\nand being left in poverty--will disappear.\r\n\r\n=Jealousy Not Toward Rivals.= Jealousy need not express itself toward\r\na sexual rival only. A person may be jealous of people who can never\r\nbe sexual rivals; the jealousy need not even be of people; it may be\r\nof inanimate objects, of a person's work, profession or hobby. Thus a\r\nwife may be intensely jealous of her husband's mother, towards whom he\r\nis very affectionate or simply kind and considerate. She may be\r\njealous of her own children if she notices or imagines that the father\r\nloves them intensely, or if he spends a good deal of time with them.\r\nShe may be jealous of his male friends, and many a husband had to give\r\nup, not only his female acquaintances, but his life-long male\r\nfriends--in order to preserve peace in the family. A wife may be\r\nfiercely jealous of her husband's success and reputation, and cases\r\nare not unknown where the wife put every possible obstacle in her\r\nhusband's way, in order to make him fail in his work, to make him turn\r\nout mediocre work, all from fear that his success would gain him\r\nadmirers, which might perhaps take him away from her. Wives have been\r\nknown to do everything in their power to _exhaust_ and weaken their\r\nhusbands, to make them physically unattractive, only to keep them. And\r\nso powerful is this primitive, childish, savage feeling, this desire\r\nfor exclusive monopoly, that there is _nothing_ a jealous wife,\r\nsweetheart or mistress may not do in order to retain the man, in order\r\nto regain him, or, having lost him irretrievably, in order to revenge\r\nherself. And what is said about the woman is applicable with equal\r\nforce to man. It is a huge mistake to assume that jealousy is woman's\r\nprerogative, her particular characteristic, or even that it is\r\nstronger in her than in man. A man can be as savagely jealous as any\r\nwoman and suffer the same tortures of hell.\r\n\r\n=Jealousy Defeats Its Object.= One of the worst features about\r\njealousy is that it defeats its own object. We have been told, as\r\nstated before, that jealousy was once upon a time a racial instinct,\r\nthat by frightening away rivals it helped to found the family and to\r\nkeep it chaste and pure. Quite the contrary is true now. More than one\r\nman has, by accusing his innocent wife of infidelity and by torturing\r\nher with baseless suspicions, driven her into the arms of a lover. We\r\nare all more or less susceptible to suggestion, and by continually\r\nsuspecting a wife of a love affair or illicit relation a man may\r\nimplant the seed of suggestion so strongly that it may grow\r\nluxuriantly and the wife may be unable to resist the suggested\r\ntemptation. And very often the very lover is suggested by the husband.\r\n\"Yes, don't attempt to deny it. It is useless. I know you have\r\nrelations with X. I know you are his mistress.\" He kept on repeating\r\nit so often to his absolutely blameless, innocent young wife and he\r\nmade her so wretched by his rudeness and brutality that one day she\r\ndid go over to X's rooms and did become his mistress. And after that\r\nshe could stand her husband's outbursts with equanimity. \"If I have\r\nthe name I might as well have the game,\" is a good bit of psychologic\r\nwisdom. And a husband should be very careful about even suspecting a\r\nwife unjustly, and thus make the first step towards rendering his\r\nbaseless suspicions a reality, his unjust accusations justified. And,\r\nof course, what is true of the husband is also true of the wife. Many\r\na wife has driven her indolent husband into the hands of prostitutes\r\nor mistresses by her incessant nagging, false accusations and vicious\r\nepithets applied to all his female friends and acquaintances.\r\n\r\nYes, from whatever angle you consider it, jealousy is a mean, nasty,\r\nmiserable feeling. Because it is a more or less universal feeling,\r\nbecause \"we cannot help it,\" does not render it less mean, less nasty,\r\nless miserable.\r\n\r\nI do not for a moment imagine that characterizing jealousy the way it\r\ndeserves to be characterized, calling it a shameful, savage, primitive\r\nfeeling, etc., is at once going to banish it from the breasts of men\r\nand women in which it has found an abiding place; throwing epithets at\r\nit will not cause it to unfasten its talons. Unfortunately, I know\r\nonly too well that our emotions are stronger than our reason; the man\r\nor woman at whose poor heart jealousy is gnawing day and night is not\r\namenable to reason, is not curable by arguments; all we can do is to\r\nsympathize with such a person and ask the Lord to pity him or her.\r\n\r\nI have known a man who lived with his wife in free union, i.e., he was\r\nnot married to her. He did not believe in marriage. Love was the only\r\nbond that should bind people together; as soon as love was no more the\r\npeople should separate in a friendly, comradely manner. If the wife or\r\nthe mistress wants another lover, she should be free to take one; she\r\nis a free human being and not her husband's chattel slave, etc., etc.,\r\netc., to the same effect. Thus the man talked. And he was sincere in\r\nhis talk--or he thought he was. But one night on unexpectedly\r\nreturning home he found another man; he promptly fired several shots\r\nat the man, which fortunately for both did not prove fatal, and then\r\nhe beat and choked his wife--who wasn't even his wife legally--within\r\nan inch of her life. _And then he married her_ and gave up his free\r\nlove talk. And I know of any number of men who could philosophize for\r\nhours about the disgrace and humiliation of being jealous, but who, as\r\nsoon as there was a justifiable cause for jealousy, became as\r\nunreasonable as a child and as jealous as any unlettered Sicilian\r\nwoman ever was.\r\n\r\nSo you see, I am not deluding myself with extravagant hopes. But,\r\nnevertheless, this argumentation, this talk, is not entirely useless.\r\nA beginning must be made. This essay may not perhaps help--except for\r\nthe suggestions that will be made towards the end--those who are\r\nalready victims of the demon of jealousy, but it may help some people\r\nto keep out of his clutches (or should I say: her clutches? I really\r\ndon't know whether the demon of jealousy is a male or a female.)\r\n\r\nFeelings are stronger than reason; but that does not mean that\r\nfeelings cannot be influenced by reason; they decidedly can be and are\r\nso influenced, and their _manifestations_ are modified by this\r\ninfluence; and the more cultured, the more educated a person is (I\r\ntrust you will know that I use these terms in their true and not their\r\nvulgar, misused meaning), the more will his feelings, or at least\r\nactions, be influenced by his reason. I am particularly a believer in\r\nthe effect on our feelings and actions of public opinion, of ideas\r\nuniversally or generally entertained.\r\n\r\nLet me give one example which is pertinent to the subject. In former\r\ndays it was universally held, and in many places it is still held,\r\nthat when a wife sinned she committed the most unpardonable crime that\r\na human being could be guilty of and that she thereby _dishonored_ her\r\nhusband. And the only right thing for him to do was to shoot the rival\r\nand cast out the wife; or at least to cast her out. This was a\r\n_conditio sine qua non_. To take her back to his home was a disgrace,\r\na sign of unpardonable weakness, of degeneracy. Our ideas on the\r\nsubject have changed a bit. A husband is no longer considered any more\r\ndishonored--in some strata of society at least--because his wife\r\nsinned than a wife is considered dishonored because her husband\r\nsinned; and adultery in the wife is now, by most rational people,\r\nconsidered only different in degree, but not in kind, from adultery in\r\nthe husband. These humane ideas have gained vogue only within a\r\ncomparatively very recent period; but their effect has already\r\nmanifested itself in a great number of instances. Forgiving the erring\r\nwife is becoming quite common. A number of cases have reached the\r\nnewspapers. Recently a wife was implicated in a nasty scrape; her sin\r\nwas not only unquestionable, but notorious; it was public property.\r\nAnd nevertheless the husband stood by her and took her back into his\r\nhome and arms. And the number of such cases which do not reach the\r\nnewspapers is very, very much larger than the public has any\r\nconception of, larger than it would be safe to estimate. And in a\r\nlarge percentage of these cases the husband begins to treat his wife\r\nwith more love, more consideration, and the tie between them becomes\r\nmore firm, more permanent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY-TWO\r\n\r\nREMEDIES FOR JEALOUSY\r\n\r\n Prevention and Cure--Prophylaxis of Jealousy--Fitting Remedy to\r\n  Circumstances--The Neglectful and Flirtatious Husband--No\r\n  Question of Love--Advice to the wife of the Flirtatious Man--An\r\n  Efficient Though Vulgar Remedy--Jealousy Must Be Experienced to\r\n  Be Understood--Necessity for Freedom of Association--Lines of\r\n  Conduct for the Wife--Contempt for a Certain Type of Wife and\r\n  Husband--The Abandoned Lover--The Effects of Unrequited\r\n  Love--Sublimated Sexual Desire--Replacing Unrequited Love--The\r\n  Attitude of Goethe--Simultaneous Loves Possible--Successive Loves\r\n  Possible--Eternal Loves--When Sex Relationships May Be\r\n  Beneficial--Purchasable Sex Relations and Their Value--The Broken\r\n  Engagement--The Terrible Effects on the Young Man--The Young\r\n  Streetwalker--Sex Relations with Fiance--Inundating Sense of\r\n  Shame--Collapse--Attempts at Suicide--An Active Sex Life--The\r\n  Results--The Prevention of Jealousy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are all agreed that prevention is more important than cure. But\r\nwhen a patient comes with a fully developed disease it is futile to\r\nspeak to him of prevention. It is too late to sermonize. What he wants\r\nand what he needs is a cure, if such can be had. What has preceded has\r\nreference chiefly to the prophylaxis of jealousy, to the prevention of\r\nthe development of this disease in the future.\r\n\r\nThe question is: Is there a _remedy_ for this malady? Is there a\r\n_cure_ for this horrible disease of jealousy?\r\n\r\nThe conditions are extremely complex, and the remedy must be fitted to\r\nthe circumstances. Let us assume that the husband neglects his wife\r\nand causes her to be jealous, not because he is in love with another\r\nwoman, but because he is flirtatious, light-headed, feather-brained\r\nand inconsiderate. Such cases are in the great majority. Many husbands\r\nwho like or love their wives and who believe themselves secure in\r\ntheir love think it is quite proper for them to hunt for new conquests\r\nand to carry on petty love affairs with as many girls or women as they\r\ncomfortably can. There is no question here about love--it is just\r\nflirtation or sexual relations. When this is the case the wife should\r\nhave a frank and firm talk with her husband; she should tell him that\r\nshe does not like his behavior and that it makes her unhappy. In many\r\ninstances this alone will suffice to effect a change in the husband's\r\nconduct. Where this does not suffice, where the husband is too\r\negotistic and does not want to give up his little pleasures, then it\r\nis left for the wife to adopt the old and rather vulgar remedy. It is\r\nold and, as said, rather vulgar, but it has the merit of efficiency:\r\nit very often works. Let the wife adopt similar tactics, let her also\r\nflirt, let her go out and come back at uncertain hours, let her keep\r\nthe husband guessing as to where and with whom she is. And nine times\r\nout of ten this, under the circumstances, fully justifiable conduct on\r\nthe part of the wife will effect a quick and radical change in the\r\nconduct of the husband. He will be only too glad to cry quits. Some\r\npeople are utterly devoid of imagination. They lack the ability of\r\nputting themselves in another person's place. Jealousy particularly is\r\nnot a feeling which any one can understand without having experienced\r\nit, unless he is endowed with the imagination of a great poet. And as\r\nfew husbands have a great poetic imagination, it is only after they\r\nhave felt the claws of the monster tearing at their own hearts that\r\nthey can understand their wives' feelings, and are willing to act so\r\nas to save them--and themselves, of course--the cruel tortures. Many\r\nwives and many husbands have talked to me and written to me on the\r\nsubject, and, as stated before, in nine times out of ten the remedy\r\nworked.\r\n\r\nBut how about the tenth case? How about the cases where the husband is\r\nunable or unwilling to give up his outside flirtations and relations?\r\nWe, advanced sexologists, know that not all men, no more than all\r\nwomen, are made in the same mould, and what is possible or even easy\r\nfor nine men may be very difficult or absolutely impossible for the\r\ntenth. We know that there are some men to whom an ironclad monogamic\r\nrelation is an absolute impossibility. The stimulation of other\r\nwomen--either the purely mental, spiritual stimulation or the\r\nstimulation of physical relations--is to them like breath in the\r\nnostrils. In fact, there are some men whose very possibility of loving\r\ntheir wives depends upon this freedom of association with other women.\r\nThey can be extremely kind to and love their wives tenderly, if they\r\ncan at the same time associate--spiritually or physically--with other\r\nwomen. If they are entirely cut off from any association with any\r\nother woman they begin to feel irritable, bored, may become ill, and\r\ntheir feeling towards their wives may become one of resentment,\r\nill-will, or even one of hatred. This is not the place to talk of the\r\nwickedness of such men--thus they are made and with this fact we have\r\nto deal.\r\n\r\nWhat is the wife of such a man to do? Two lines of conduct are open to\r\nher--two avenues of exit. The line of conduct will depend upon her\r\ntemper and upon her ideas of sex morality. But she ought to select the\r\nline of conduct which will cause the least pain, the least\r\nunhappiness. If she is a woman of a proud, independent temper,\r\nparticularly if she belongs to the militant type, she will leave her\r\nhusband in a huff, regardless of consequences. But if she is a woman\r\nof the gentler, more pliable, more supple (and I may also say more\r\nsubtle) type, and if she really loves her husband, she will overlook\r\nhis little foibles, peccadilloes and transgressions--and she may live\r\nquite happily. And the time will come when the husband himself will\r\ngive up his peccadilloes and transgressions and will cleave powerfully\r\nto his wife, will be bound to her by bonds never to be torn asunder.\r\n_I know of several such cases._\r\n\r\nAnd I will take this opportunity to say that I have the deepest\r\ncontempt for the wife who, on finding out that her husband had\r\ncommitted a transgression or that he has a love affair, leaves him in\r\na huff, or makes a public scandal, or sues for divorce. Such a wife\r\n_never_ loved her husband, and he is well rid of her. And what I said\r\nabout the wife applies with _almost_ equal force to the husband.\r\n\r\n=The Abandoned Lover.= But what shall the abandoned lover do? Let us\r\ntake the case of A and B, and let A stand for any man and B for any\r\nwoman; or, _vice versa_, let A be the woman and B the man, for in\r\njealousy and love what applies to one sex is applicable with\r\npractically the same force to the opposite sex. Suppose A is intensely\r\njealous of and deeply, passionately in love with B; but B is utterly\r\nindifferent and does not care what A may feel or do. A and B may be\r\nmarried or not; this does not alter the case materially. Suppose B, if\r\nunmarried to A, goes off and marries another man, or, if married to\r\nA, goes off and leaves him; or suppose B does not love anybody else,\r\nbut just remains indifferent to A's advances or repels him because she\r\ncannot reciprocate his love. Unrequited love alone can cause almost as\r\nfierce tortures as the most intense jealousy. And A suffers tortures.\r\nWhat shall he do? What shall he do to save himself--to save his\r\nhealth, his mind, his life? For he is unable to eat, unable to sleep,\r\nunable to work, and he feels that he is going to pieces. He has lost\r\nhis position and is in danger of losing his reason. What shall he do\r\nto escape insanity or a suicide's grave? There is but one remedy. Let\r\nhim use all his energies to find a _substitute_. I mean a living\r\nsubstitute. Mere sexual desire may be sublimated, to a certain extent,\r\ninto other channels, may be replaced by work, study, a hobby or some\r\nengrossing interest. A great unrequited love, with the element of\r\njealousy present or absent, cannot be replaced by anything else except\r\nby another love. And where as great a love is impossible let it be a\r\nminor love or a series of minor loves. When Goethe, one of the world's\r\ngreat lovers, was unable to walk in the broad avenue of a great love\r\nhe would walk in the by-paths of a number of little loves. The common\r\ntalk about a person being unable to love more than once in his or her\r\nlife is silly nonsense. A man or a woman is able to love, and love\r\nvery deeply, a number of times; and love simultaneously or\r\nsuccessively. It is often a mere matter of opportunity. I know that\r\nthere _are_ loves that are eternal; that there are loves for which no\r\nsubstitute can be found. But these supreme, divine loves are so rare\r\nthat among ordinary mortals they may be left out of account. They are\r\nthe portion of supermen and superwomen. Ordinarily a substitute may be\r\nfound. The substitute love may never reach the intensity of the\r\noriginal love, it may never give full or even half-full satisfaction;\r\nbut it will help to dull the sharp cutting edge, it will act as a\r\npartial hemostatic to the bleeding heart, it will soothe and\r\nanesthetize the wound even if it cannot completely heal it. And this\r\nis a valuable aid while the sufferer is coming to himself or herself,\r\nwhile the gathered fragments of a broken life are being cemented and\r\nwhile the cement is hardening. Yes, the man or woman who is in inferno\r\non account of an unreciprocated or a betrayed love should lose no time\r\nin searching for a substitute love. I do not believe in people losing\r\ntheir health and their minds on account of suffering which does nobody\r\nany good.\r\n\r\nBut I will go still further. Where a substitute love--great or\r\nminor--cannot be found, then mere sex relations may help to diminish\r\nthe suffering, to quiet the turbulent heart, to relieve the aching\r\nbrain. As everything connected with sex, so our ideas about illicit\r\nsex relations that are not connected with love, are honeycombed with\r\nhypocrisy and false to the core. While purchasable, loveless sex\r\nrelations can, of course, not be compared to love relations, still\r\nunder our present social, economic and moral code they are the only\r\nrelations that thousands of men and women can enjoy, and they are\r\nbetter than none; and in quite a considerable percentage of cases an\r\nelement of romance and greater or lesser permanency do become attached\r\nto them, and they act as a more or less satisfactory substitute for\r\ngenuine love relations.\r\n\r\nI am not spinning theoretical gossamer webs. I am speaking from\r\nexperience--the experience of patients and confiding friends. I could\r\nrelate many interesting cases. And I may, in a more appropriate\r\nvolume. Here one or two will have to suffice.\r\n\r\nHe was twenty-six years old and a senior student in the College of\r\nPhysicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York. He had been in\r\nlove with and had considered himself engaged for four or five years to\r\na young lady two years his junior. She was, of course, the most\r\nwonderful young lady in the world, the whole world; in fact, there was\r\nnot another one to compare her to. She was unique; she stood all\r\nalone. But for a year or so she was getting rather cool towards him;\r\nwhich fanned his flame all the more. And suddenly he received a note\r\nasking him not to call any more, nor to try to communicate in any\r\nother way. He did write, but his letters were returned unopened. And\r\nsoon after he read of her engagement to a prominent young banker. He\r\nnearly went insane, and this is used not in any figurative sense. His\r\ninsomnia was _complete_, and resisted all treatment. When his pulse\r\nbecame very rapid and his eyes acquired the wild look that they do\r\nafter many sleepless nights an attempt was made to administer\r\nhypnotics, but they had practically no effect. Chloral, veronal, etc.,\r\nonly made him \"dopy,\" irritable and depressed, but did not give him\r\none hour of sound sleep. His appetite was gone, now and then his limbs\r\nwould twitch, and he would sit and stare into space for hours at a\r\ntime. To study or attend the clinics was out of the question, and he\r\ndid not even attempt to take the final examinations. The parents felt\r\ndistressed, but were unable to do anything for him. The least attempt\r\nat interference on their part, any attempt to console him, to induce\r\nhim to pull himself together, made him more irritable, more morose; so\r\nthat they finally left him alone. He was practically a total\r\nabstainer, but one evening he went out and came home drunk; and after\r\nthat he drank frequently and heavily. His parents could do nothing\r\nwith him. One evening on Broadway he was accosted by a young\r\nstreet-walker. She had a pleasant, sympathetic face, and he went with\r\nher. _That was his first sex experience._ Up to that time he was\r\nchaste. He met her again the following evening. Gradually a sort of\r\nfriendship grew up between them. She found out the cause of his grief,\r\nand with maternal solicitude she tried everything in her power to\r\nconsole him, and he began to look forward to the nightly meeting with\r\nher. His grief became gradually less acute, he gave up drinking, which\r\nhe disliked, and which he had taken up only to deaden his pain; he\r\nbegan to pull himself together, and in six or eight months he took\r\nover his last year in Columbia and was properly graduated. He kept up\r\nthe friendship with the girl for over two years, when she died of\r\npneumonia. He did not love her, but he liked to be with her, as her\r\npresence gave him physical and mental comfort. It is possible that she\r\nloved him genuinely, but there was never any sentimental talk between\r\nthem, and there was never any question between them of the permanency\r\nof the relationship. They both knew that it was temporary. But he is\r\nabsolutely certain that but for one of the representatives of the\r\nclass that is despised, driven about and persecuted by brutal\r\npolicemen and ignorant judges, he would have become a bum, or, most\r\nlikely, he would have committed suicide--at the point of which he was\r\nseveral times; only pity for his mother and sisters restrained him.\r\n\r\nAnd here is another case. A girl about twenty-eight years of age fell\r\nin love with a man four or five years her senior. The love seemed to\r\nbe reciprocated, and they soon became engaged to be married. He asked\r\nthat the engagement, on account of certain business reasons, be kept\r\nsecret. She did not know the man well; she had met him at several\r\nentertainments and church affairs and he seemed very nice. He always\r\nfound some excuses for delaying the marriage, and after they had been\r\nengaged about a year he began to insist on sex relations. Though of a\r\nrefined and noble character, she was of a passionate nature and she\r\ndid not offer much resistance. Many girls who would under no\r\ncircumstance indulge in illicit relations, considering it a great sin,\r\nhave no compunctions about having relations with their fiances. They\r\nlived together for about a year. They were together almost daily,\r\nexcept now and then, when he would go away for a week or two on\r\nbusiness. Once he went away--and never came back. He wrote to her that\r\ntheir relations were at an end; that he was a married man and a\r\nfather of children; he had hoped he might get a divorce, but that now\r\nhe had changed his mind and that she must forget him, etc. Everything\r\nwas black before her. It cost her a supreme effort not to faint, and\r\nshe was supported in this effort by the fact that when the letter came\r\nshe was in the presence of friends; a terrible, overpowering,\r\nall-inundating sense of shame gave her the strength not to betray her\r\ncondition and her story before the world at large. But as soon as she\r\nwas alone she collapsed completely. There was the most absolute\r\ninsomnia imaginable, complete anorexia, but the most distressing\r\nfeatures were frequent fainting spells, severe palpitation of the\r\nheart and tremors. She had no love for the man--so she said. Her love\r\nhad turned to hatred and contempt--but the jealousy was all-consuming.\r\nLike a fire it was burning in her, searing her brain and her soul day\r\nand night.\r\n\r\nShe felt that she was not strong enough to stand this physical and\r\nmental torture, and so she decided to commit suicide. As the means she\r\nselected gas. Fortunately, the smell became perceptible before the\r\ninjury was irreparable. She was saved. But she felt that she could not\r\nstand the torture very long--and more than anything was she afraid\r\nthat her mind would give way. She had a special horror of insanity.\r\nAnd so she decided to make another attempt This time with bichloride.\r\nAgain she was saved. A friend of hers then got an inkling of the\r\nevents that were transpiring, and she introduced her to some gentlemen\r\nfriends. They were nice people and more or less radical on the sex\r\nquestion. In order to drown her pain she began to go out very\r\nfrequently with that crowd, and to her surprise and delight she found\r\nthat she soon began to think less and less about her contemptible\r\nseducer, and, what was more important to her, she was soon able to\r\nsleep. For about six months she led an extremely active, almost\r\npromiscuous sex life. But then she gave it up, as she felt herself\r\nnormal and no longer in need of it. She is now happily married.\r\n\r\nI am through with this rather lengthy essay on one of the most painful\r\nmanifestations of human emotional life. I repeat that I am aware that\r\nfeelings are often stronger than reason; but saying this does not mean\r\nasserting that feelings cannot be modified and held in check by\r\nreason. And I feel confident that a careful, open-minded reading of\r\nthese pages and an acceptance of the ideas therein promulgated would\r\naid in _preventing_ a good deal of the misery of jealousy and in\r\ncuring a certain proportion of it after it has found lodgment in the\r\nhearts of unhappy men and women.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two more points that might be touched upon, but with\r\nthe freedom of press in reference to sex matters as it exists in this\r\ncountry to-day, I have said all that I could say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY-THREE\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING WORDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is my sincere belief--and I cherish the belief in spite of this\r\nhorrible, wretched war which seems to be shattering the very\r\nfoundations of everything that we hold dear, destroying all the humane\r\nand moral achievements that have been laboriously built up in the\r\ncourse of many centuries--that the time will come when the world will\r\nbe practically free from pain and suffering. Almost all disease will\r\nbe conquered, accidents will be rare, the fear of starvation or\r\npoverty or unemployment will no longer haunt men and women, every\r\ninfant born will be well-born and welcome, and the numerous anxieties\r\nand ambitions that now disturb the lives of so many of the earth's\r\ninhabitants will no longer plague us. They will be the dead memories\r\nof a dead and forgotten past.\r\n\r\nYes, I believe that the time will come when the world will be\r\npractically free from pain and suffering. But there is one exception.\r\nI do not believe that we will ever be able entirely to eliminate the\r\n_tragedies of the heart_. For our physical ills, which will be few in\r\nnumber, there will be a socialized medical profession; everywhere\r\nthere will be free hospitals and convalescent homes. The unemployment\r\nproblem will be dealt with by the State, and dealt with so that there\r\nwill be no unemployment problem. There will be work for everybody and\r\neverybody will do the work which he finds most congenial. But the\r\nState, I fear, will be able to do nothing in affairs of the heart.\r\nWhen John loves Mary with every fiber of his soul, and Mary remains\r\ncompletely indifferent, then no State physician and no Government\r\nofficial will be able to offer any balm or consolation to poor John.\r\nAnd if Mary loves Robert, and Robert behaves so that he breaks Mary's\r\nheart, then no official glue will put it together and no convalescent\r\nhome will make it whole.\r\n\r\nYes, I believe that love pangs and tragedies of the heart will cause\r\nmortal men and women suffering even under the most perfect social\r\nregime. But I also believe that these pangs will be less acute, that\r\nthe suffering will be less cruel than it is now.\r\n\r\nProper ideas about love, freer intercourse between the sexes, a normal\r\nand regular sex life, a saner attitude towards many things which are\r\nnow unjustly considered shameful or criminal will, to a large degree,\r\nprevent the heart tragedies and facilitate their cure where they\r\ncannot be prevented.\r\n\r\nAnd it is the duty of everybody who loves mankind to study the various\r\nphases of human sexuality and help to spread sane and humane ideas on\r\nthe subject of Sex and Love.\r\n\r\nThe author trusts that WOMAN: HER SEX AND LOVE LIFE will help, in some\r\nslight degree, in spreading healthy, sane and honest ideas about sex\r\namong the men and women of America.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEXUAL TRUTHS\r\n\r\nVERSUS\r\n\r\nSEXUAL LIES, MISCONCEPTIONS AND EXAGGERATIONS\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM J.
