ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Preface.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the ladies of America is this little work, \"THE LADIES' BOOK OF\r\nUSEFUL INFORMATION,\" dedicated. It is a book written expressly for\r\nwomen. This book is full from cover to cover of useful and necessary\r\ninformation for women. Never before has so much knowledge with which\r\nwomen should be acquainted been printed in one book. It is a perfect\r\nstorehouse of useful facts. Almost every lady spends many dollars\r\nevery year for cosmetics, medicines, household articles, etc., which\r\nthis book would save her.\r\n\r\nThis is a book which every lady should have, and which every mother\r\nshould place in the hands of her daughters as they come to years of\r\nunderstanding. Every girl of twelve and upwards should read this\r\nvaluable work.\r\n\r\nMany books costing from three to five dollars do not contain half the\r\ninformation contained in this work. Everything described in this\r\npreface is taught in this book.\r\n\r\nIt teaches ladies the secret of Youth, Beauty, Health.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter teaches all about Personal Beauty.\r\n\r\nEvery lady desires to be beautiful, and it is the duty of every woman\r\nto be as attractive as possible. All may enhance their charms and be\r\nlovely by following the directions of this book. Few persons know how\r\nto improve their natural looks so as to captivate, charm, and win the\r\nadmiration of those whom they meet. This book tells the wonderful\r\nsecret--all the ancients ever knew, and all that has been discovered\r\nsince. It teaches how to wonderfully improve the person in loveliness.\r\nThe real secret of changing an ordinary looking person into one of\r\ngreat beauty makes this book of great value. Nature does something for\r\nus, but art must make the perfect man or woman.\r\n\r\nIf you desire bright, melting eyes, a clear, soft, rose-tinted\r\ncomplexion, beautiful hands and graceful figure, well-developed and\r\nperfect, use the knowledge which you will find in this book.\r\n\r\nIt teaches how to acquire a beautiful, delicate loveliness which\r\ncannot be surpassed, and which can be retained to a very late age. By\r\nmeans of this teaching a woman of thirty-five or forty can easily pass\r\nfor a girl of twenty-five.\r\n\r\nIt teaches how to conceal the evidence of age, and how to make the\r\nmost stubbornly red and rough hands beautifully soft and white.\r\nRemember that \"THE LADIES' BOOK OF USEFUL INFORMATION\" does not teach\r\nthe use of paint and powder, which is injurious to the skin, but how\r\nto make the _cheek glow_ with health, and the _neck_, _arms_ and\r\n_hands_ to rival the lily in whiteness. It teaches how to cure Greasy\r\nSkin, Freckles, Pimples, Wrinkles, Blackheads, Crow's-feet, Blotches,\r\nFace Grubs, Tan, Sunburn, Chapped Hands, Sore Lips, etc.\r\n\r\nIt teaches how to cure and prevent redness and roughness, and to make\r\nthe skin soft, smooth, white and delicate, producing a perfectly\r\nnatural appearance. It teaches how to cure and refine a coarse skin,\r\nso that it will be clear and white.\r\n\r\nIt tells what has never before been published: How to restore a fair,\r\nrosy complexion to its original freshness, after it has become sallow\r\nand faded. This is a wonderful secret, and is sure in its results. It\r\nwill also cause those who have always been pale to have beautiful,\r\nbright, rosy cheeks, and the eyes to be brilliant and sparkling.\r\n\r\nIt teaches how to have soft, white and attractive hands, even though\r\ncompelled to do housework. Every lady desires to have nice hands, and\r\nall may do so by following the directions of this book. The most\r\ncoarse, rough, red hands will, by following this teaching, become\r\nbeautifully delicate and white, and it causes very little trouble to\r\ncare for them.\r\n\r\nIt teaches how to care for the hair so as to improve the growth and to\r\nhave a beautiful and luxuriant head of hair; how to keep the skin of\r\nthe scalp healthy, to cure Dandruff, to prevent the hair falling, and\r\nto have it of a nice glossy hue.\r\n\r\nIt teaches how to have clear and brilliant eyes, with beautiful, long,\r\ndrooping lashes; also, how to cure sore and weak eyes.\r\n\r\nIt teaches how to care for the teeth so as to have them white and\r\nsound, telling how to treat those that are decayed, and how to prevent\r\nthe decay of sound ones.\r\n\r\nIt teaches how to have beautiful ripe red lips, and how to cure sore\r\nand chapped lips.\r\n\r\nIt teaches how to cure Warts, Corns, Bruises, Sprains, Cold Feet, Bad\r\nBreath, etc.\r\n\r\nIt teaches how to bleach, purify and whiten the most stubbornly red,\r\nrough skin, so that it will be beautifully clear and white; and a\r\ncomplexion that is naturally passable will be admired by all who see\r\nit after being treated as here described.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter teaches: The different human temperaments; how to\r\ntell to which temperament you belong yourself, and also the\r\ntemperaments of those whom you meet;\r\n\r\nThe fortunate and unfortunate days of the month, and their importance\r\nat the hour of birth;\r\n\r\nImportant advice to females regarding their thirty-first year;\r\n\r\nHow to know whom you will marry;\r\n\r\nThe signs of a good genius;\r\n\r\nAll about Electrical Psychology, or Psychological\r\nFascination--Mesmerism;\r\n\r\nHow to make persons at a distance think of you (this is a purely\r\nnatural phenomenon);\r\n\r\nHow to win the affection of the person of the opposite sex whom you\r\nsincerely love. There is no black art about this, but merely\r\npsychological attraction, and by its use you can win the love of the\r\nperson whose affection you desire.\r\n\r\nWhen you desire the \"love\" of any one whom you meet, you can very\r\nreadily reach him if you observe the directions here given.\r\n\r\nChapter three is a special chapter for young women, on a special\r\nsubject, and contains advice which every young lady should study.\r\n\r\nIt teaches them: What marriage is, and explains how highly injurious\r\nit is to entertain low ideas regarding it;\r\n\r\nHow a young lady should act in the presence of young men;\r\n\r\nWhat a girl should do when a prospect of marriage occurs.\r\n\r\nIt tells some of the most prolific sources of matrimonial\r\ndifficulties, and how to remedy them;\r\n\r\nWhat ladies should do who desire that their husbands should be amiable\r\nand kind;\r\n\r\nWhat attentions are due to you _as a lady_.\r\n\r\nCautions against the failing of young ladies making themselves too\r\ncheap.\r\n\r\nTells what \"woman\" is formed to be.\r\n\r\nWarns against indiscretions before marriage, and teaches that under\r\nall circumstance a lady will be looked to to resist any advances, and\r\nmaintain her purity and virtue.\r\n\r\nTells what is the nature, naturally, of young women;\r\n\r\nHow a young woman should act when receiving the attentions of a young\r\nman;\r\n\r\nHow you will know when the young man whom you _should marry_ presents\r\nhimself to you;\r\n\r\nWhat a man needs a wife for, and how to qualify yourself for the\r\nposition;\r\n\r\nAbout misunderstandings in early married life;\r\n\r\nHow a young mother feels towards her first-born.\r\n\r\nTells the good influence of virtuous love;\r\n\r\nWhat young people should know before they become engaged.\r\n\r\nChapter four teaches about Love and Marriage; the attraction of the\r\nsexes for each other; what love is; what causes it; individual loves;\r\nfondness for cousins; different kinds of love; flirtation; the object\r\nof marriage; should marriage be for life.\r\n\r\nChapter five: When to Marry--How to Select a Partner on Right\r\nPrinciples.\r\n\r\nTreats of the proper age to marry; which marriages are the most happy;\r\nwhich are the most productive of handsome children; how nature assists\r\nart in the choice of partners; the attributes of a handsome couple,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nChapter six: Sexual Intercourse--Its Laws and Conditions--Its Use and\r\nAbuse.\r\n\r\nThere is an alarming and increasing prevalence of nervous ailments and\r\ncomplicated disorders that could be traced to have their sole origin\r\nin the ignorance, which is so universal, of the laws of these organs.\r\n\r\nThis chapter teaches all about sexual morality; how men and women\r\nshould live; the law from the age of puberty to marriage; the law of\r\nmarriage; what a man who truly loves a woman will do; a true union;\r\nhow women are protected; the false and the true sense of duty; what is\r\nthe most powerful restraint from evil.\r\n\r\nThe above is discussed in a chaste, simple, manner, and should be read\r\nby every lady. There is nothing impure in this book from beginning to\r\nend, but subjects in which women are woefully ignorant are discussed\r\nin a plain, moral manner to which no objection can be raised.\r\n\r\nChapter seven: Marriage.\r\n\r\nWhat marriage is; how far back the marriage tie has existed; polygamy,\r\nwhat it is; monogamy, what it is; polyandry, and what it is; marriage\r\ncustoms; the basis of a happy marriage, etc.\r\n\r\nChapter eight: Pregnancy--Labor--Parturition.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no more eventful period in the history of woman than\r\nthat in which she first becomes conscious that the existence of\r\nanother being is dependent upon her own, and that she carries about\r\nwith her the first tiny rudiments of an immortal soul.\r\n\r\nThis chapter explains all the signs of pregnancy; the changes that\r\ntake place in the face and neck; the suppression of the monthly flow;\r\nchanges in the breast, etc.\r\n\r\nThen it gives a sure test for the detection of pregnancy. It tells how\r\na pregnant woman should live during the period of gestation.\r\n\r\nChildbirth is not necessarily either painful or dangerous. It can be\r\naccomplished easily and safely and with comparatively no pain by\r\nfollowing the directions given in \"THE LADIES' BOOK OF USEFUL\r\nINFORMATION.\"\r\n\r\nNumerous instances are known where ladies who had previously suffered\r\nwith severe labor in childbirth have, by attending to the directions\r\nhere given, been delivered of fine, healthy children with comparative\r\nease.\r\n\r\nNo mother who has attended to the teaching here given but has blessed\r\nthe knowledge of it, and it has saved many a young mother much\r\nneedless terror.\r\n\r\nIt tells all about the ailments that almost always torment women\r\nduring the trying time of pregnancy, making life itself seem a burden.\r\n\r\nThese troubles are: Morning Sickness, Toothache, Palpitation of the\r\nHeart, etc. It shows that there is no necessity for women suffering as\r\nthey almost invariably do during this time; but that these troubles\r\nmay be overcome by simple, safe remedies which are described in this\r\nbook, and which may be safely taken by the patient.\r\n\r\nIt tells all about the medicine which is taken by the Indian women of\r\nNorth America during the period of gestation. It is well known that\r\nthe women of these tribes suffer very little during childbirth, and it\r\nis almost all due to the effects of this wonderful medicine.\r\n\r\nThe recipe for this medicine, \"Parturient Balm,\" was obtained from an\r\nIndian doctor, and is given in this book, together with instructions\r\nas to how it is to be taken.\r\n\r\nThis chapter alone is worth the price of the book to any lady. Every\r\nmother, and everyone who ever expects to become a mother, should\r\ncarefully study the above chapter, as it may be the means of saving\r\nher much pain and suffering.\r\n\r\nThe same chapter explains all about a case of labor; the signs that\r\nshow when labor has commenced; what to give to help the patient; the\r\ndifferent kinds of pains; the length of time between the pains; the\r\nlength of time the pains should last, etc.; the taking of the child\r\nfrom the mother; how to care for the child; the taking away of the\r\nafterbirth; what to do in case of flooding; how to relieve afterpains,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIt also explains what \"Abortion\" is; what causes abortion; what causes\r\npremature labor; the difference between the two; symptoms of\r\nthreatened abortion, and how to prevent the same if possible; what to\r\ndo for miscarriage, and to try and prevent it, etc.\r\n\r\nThe ninth chapter teaches all about: Menstruation--Change of\r\nLife--Falling of the Womb, etc. Tells the time of life at which the\r\nmenses should appear.\r\n\r\nEvery mother should watch her young daughter as she nears this\r\ncritical time. The health for many years to come depends to a great\r\nextent on how a girl passes this period. This chapter tells all the\r\nsymptoms of the near approach of the monthly flow. It shows a mother\r\nhow to care for her daughter, and to see that she has proper attention\r\nduring this time.\r\n\r\nIt tells the age at which the periodical flow should commence; the\r\nsymptoms of its approach; how a girl should be treated at this time;\r\nhow to cure Chlorosis, or Green Sickness; how to relieve and cure\r\npainful and suppressed menstruation, etc.\r\n\r\nIf the instructions of this book are followed in cases like the above,\r\nit will save many young girls much needless suffering.\r\n\r\nThis chapter also treats on: Whites, or Flour Albus, and Falling of\r\nthe Womb.\r\n\r\nMany delicate women suffer great agony through these two distressing\r\ncomplaints. This chapter describes all the symptoms of these\r\ncomplaints, and gives simple, safe remedies for them. A lady can\r\neasily attend to herself and avoid exposure.\r\n\r\nIt also treats on Change of Life.\r\n\r\nBy the phrase \"Change of Life,\" or \"The Critical Period,\" we\r\nunderstand the final cessation or stoppage of the menses. This chapter\r\nexplains all about this trying time, the symptoms of its appearance,\r\nand the ages at which it usually occurs.\r\n\r\nWith proper care this period may be safely passed, and a happy and\r\ncomfortable old age be spent. All the dangers incident to this period\r\nare described, and how to successfully combat them.\r\n\r\nChapter ten: Collection of valuable Medical Compounds.\r\n\r\nAny of the formulas in this chapter will be readily filled by your\r\ndruggist. Each recipe will give an article which is the _very best_\r\nthing that can be used for the disease which it is recommended to\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nThe first is \"Magic Kidney and Liver Restorer.\"\r\n\r\nMost people are afflicted to some extent with Kidney and Liver\r\ntrouble.

It never fails.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of dyspepsia are:\r\n              Feeling of weight in the stomach;\r\n              Bloated condition after eating;\r\n              Belching of wind;\r\n              Nausea;\r\n              Vomiting of food;\r\n              Water brash;\r\n              Pain in the stomach;\r\n              Heartburn;\r\n              Bad taste in the mouth in the morning;\r\n              Palpitation of the heart;\r\n              Cankered mouth; loss of flesh;\r\n              Fickle appetite; depression of spirits;\r\n              Lack of energy; headache and constipation.\r\n\r\nIf you have _any or all_ of the above symptoms, then you are afflicted\r\nwith Dyspepsia, and should endeavor to obtain relief. \"Dyspeptic Ley\"\r\nis a certain cure. It is easily prepared, and should be taken by\r\neveryone who is afflicted with any of the above distressing symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe same chapter tells how to cure Ague, Intermittent Fever,\r\nNeuralgia, Sick Headache, Neuralgic Headache, Rheumatism, Dysentery,\r\nEpileptic Fits, Hysteria, Bleeding of the Lungs, Coughs, Bowel\r\nComplaint, Scrofula, Worms, Sore Eyes, Cholera, Piles, Warts, Corns,\r\nDeafness, Inverted Toe-nail, etc.\r\n\r\nAll these diseases are described, together with the best method of\r\ntreating them.\r\n\r\nChapter eleven teaches how to Prepare Nourishment for the Sick Room.\r\nVery few people know how to prepare nourishment for the sick. This\r\nchapter teaches how to prepare a great number of nourishing dishes.\r\nEvery lady should know how to prepare food for the sick, as at some\r\ntime or other there is almost certain to be sickness in every family.\r\nThere are over forty recipes given in this chapter for food for the\r\nsick and convalescent.\r\n\r\nChapter twelve describes things Curious and Useful.\r\n\r\nIt tells: How to get clear of mosquitoes; how to get rid of bedbugs;\r\nto obtain fresh-blown flowers in winter. By this process the buds of\r\nflowers can be gathered in summer and autumn and kept until the\r\nwinter, when they can be used as required. The flowers open and are as\r\nbeautiful as though fresh plucked from the garden. Any one can\r\nunderstand the process, as it is very simple.\r\n\r\nAlso: How to transfer all kinds of pictures on to glass--a very pretty\r\nart; how to prevent horses being teased by flies; how to prevent flies\r\nlighting on to windows, pictures, mirrors, etc.; to render paper\r\nfireproof; to render boots waterproof; how to extract the essential\r\noil from any flower; how to take leaf photographs; to cure\r\ndrunkenness; to make different kinds of perfumes; to write secret\r\nletters, etc.;\r\n\r\nTo prepare flowers so that their beauty will remain unimpaired for\r\nyears.

The process is very easy, and the directions are so\r\nsimple that a child may follow them.\r\n\r\nChapter thirteen treats of Home Decoration.\r\n\r\nIt teaches how to arrange a house so as to furnish it cheaply and\r\nharmoniously. It gives complete instructions for every room--Hall,\r\nParlor, Library, Dining-room, Bedrooms, etc., and attends to every\r\ndetail. This is a splendid guide to all who wish to make their home\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nChapter fourteen teaches all about caring for House Plants.

If the directions here given are followed the stamping will\r\nalways be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nChapter seventeen teaches how to do Bronze Work.\r\n\r\nBronzing is the latest improvement in wax work, and if properly made\r\ncannot be detected from the most expensive, artistic bronze. It is\r\nused for table, mantel and bracket ornaments, and may be exposed to\r\ndust and air without sustaining the slightest injury. It can be dusted\r\nlike any piece of furniture, and makes a very desirable, inexpensive\r\nornament. The colors it is made in are Gold, Silver, Copper, Fire, and\r\nGreen Bronze. Among the articles described are a vase in bronze, a\r\nmotto in bronze, a floral basket in bronze, animals and birds in\r\nbronze, statuary in bronze, flowers and leaves in bronze.\r\n\r\nThe art of making each of the above articles is carefully described so\r\nthat any one can follow the directions.\r\n\r\nThe art of Decalcomania is also taught in this chapter. This is used\r\nupon almost everything for which ornamentation is required, such as\r\nCrockery, China, Porcelain, Vases, Glass, Bookcases, Folios, Boxes,\r\nLap desks, Ribbons, etc. It is a very pretty art, and is much admired.\r\n\r\nChapter eighteen gives twelve recipes for articles needed in every\r\nhousehold. It will tell you how to save a large percentage of\r\nhousehold expenses, and also how to have a great many of the articles\r\nyou use in your daily housework of a superior quality, vastly better\r\nthan the ones you are using at the present time.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact not generally known, that a great many of the articles\r\nused in daily household work cost little more than one-tenth of the\r\nprice the consumer pays. We purpose to show the readers of this book\r\nhow to have, in most instances, better articles than those they buy,\r\nfor a small percentage of the cost. To do this, we have, by our own\r\npersonal investigation, gathered a number of valuable recipes\r\ntogether, and have paid for the privilege of using them.\r\n\r\nWe give in \"The Ladies' Book of Useful Information\" twelve recipes\r\nwhich have never before been published, and which, if you once\r\npossess, you will never wish to be without, as they are truly valuable\r\nsecrets.\r\n\r\nThe list is as follows: Healing salve; Magnetic croup cure; Worm\r\nelixir; Brilliant self-shining stove polish; Wonderful starch enamel;\r\nRoyal washing powder; Magic annihilator; I X L baking powder; Electric\r\npowder; French polish or dressing for leather; Artificial honey.\r\n\r\nIt also contains a list of all the poisons and their antidotes.

There is nothing more pleasing to the eye than a\r\ndelicate, smooth skin; and besides being pleasing to the eye, is an\r\nevidence of health, and gives additional grace to the most regular\r\nfeatures. The choice of soaps has considerable influence in promoting\r\nand maintaining this desideratum. These should invariably be selected\r\nof the finest kinds, and used sparingly, and never with cold water,\r\nfor the alkali which, more or less, mingles in the composition of all\r\nsoaps has an undoubted tendency to irritate a delicate skin; warm\r\nwater excites a gentle perspiration, thereby assisting the skin to\r\nthrow off those natural secretions which, if allowed to remain, are\r\nlikely to accumulate below the skin and produce roughness, pimples,\r\nand even eruptions of an obstinate and unpleasant character. Those\r\nsoaps which ensure a moderate fairness and flexibility of the skin are\r\nthe most desirable for regular use.\r\n\r\nPomades, when properly prepared, contribute in an especial manner to\r\npreserve the softness and elasticity of the skin, their effect being\r\nof an emollient and congenial nature; and, moreover, they can be\r\napplied on retiring to rest, when their effects are not liable to be\r\ndisturbed by the action of the atmosphere, muscular exertions or\r\nnervous influences.\r\n\r\nThe use of paints has been very correctly characterized as \"a species\r\nof corporeal hypocrisy as subversive of delicacy of mind as it is of\r\nthe natural complexion,\" and has been, of late years, discarded at the\r\ntoilette of every lady.\r\n\r\nThe use of cosmetics has been common in all ages and in every land.\r\nScripture itself records the painting of Jezebel; and Ezekiel, the\r\nprophet, speaks of the eye-painting common among the women; and\r\nJeremiah, of rending the face with painting--a most expressive term\r\nfor the destruction of beauty by such means. For the surest destroyers\r\nof real beauty are its simulators. The usurper destroys the rightful\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nThat paint can ever deceive people, or really add beauty for more than\r\nthe duration of an acted charade or play, when \"distance lends\r\nenchantment to the view,\" is a delusion; but it is one into which\r\nwomen of all times and nations have fallen--from the painted Indian\r\nsquaw to the rouged and powdered denizen of London or Paris.\r\n\r\nMilk was the favorite cosmetic of the ladies of ancient Rome. They\r\napplied plasters of bread and ass's milk to their faces at night, and\r\nwashed them off with milk in the morning.\r\n\r\nAs a cosmetic, milk would be harmless, but we doubt its power of\r\nimproving the skin. As a beverage, no doubt, it whitens the complexion\r\nmore than any other food.\r\n\r\nBut before we speak of improving the complexion, it will be well to\r\nexplain to our readers the nature and properties of the skin.\r\n\r\nThis is what an American physician has recently told us about it:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       THE SKIN--ITS BEAUTY, USES, CONSTRUCTION, MANAGEMENT, ETC.\r\n\r\nEvery person knows what the skin is, its external appearance, and its\r\ngeneral properties; but there are many of my readers who may not be\r\naware of its peculiar and wonderful construction, its compound\r\ncharacter, and its manifold uses. It not merely acts as an organ of\r\nsense, and a protection to the surface of the body, but it clothes it,\r\nas it were, in a garment of the most delicate texture and of the most\r\nsurpassing loveliness. In perfect health it is gifted with exquisite\r\nsensibility, and while it possesses the softness of velvet, and\r\nexhibits the delicate hues of the lily, the carnation, and the rose,\r\nit is nevertheless gifted with extraordinary strength and power of\r\nresisting external injury, and is not only capable of repairing, but\r\nof actually renewing itself. Though unprotected with hair, wool or\r\nfur, or with feathers or scales, as with the brute creation, the human\r\nskin is furnished with innumerable nerves, which endow it with extreme\r\nsusceptibility to all the various changes of climate and of weather,\r\nand prompt the mind to provide suitable materials, in the shape of\r\nclothing, to shield it under all the circumstances in which it can be\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the due exposure of the body to daylight or sunlight\r\ncannot be too strongly insisted on. Light and warmth are powerful\r\nagents in the economy of our being. The former especially is an\r\noperative agent on which health, vigor, and even beauty itself,\r\ndepend. Withdraw the light of the sun from the organic world, and all\r\nits various beings and objects would languish and gradually lose those\r\ncharms which are now their characteristics. In its absence, the\r\ncarnation tint leaves the cheek of beauty, the cherry hue of the lips\r\nchanges to a leaden-purple, the eyes become glassy and expressionless,\r\nand the complexion assumes an unnatural, cadaverous appearance that\r\nspeaks of sickness, night and death. So powerful is daylight, so\r\nnecessary to our well-being, that even its partial exclusion, or its\r\ninsufficient admission to our apartments, soon tells its tale in the\r\nfeeble health, the liability to the attacks of disease, and the pallid\r\nfeatures (vacant and sunken, or flabby, pendent and uninviting) of\r\ntheir inmates. Even the aspect of the rooms in which we pass most of\r\nour time, and the number and extent of their windows, is perceptible,\r\nby the trained eye, in the complexion and features of those that\r\noccupy them. So in the vegetable world--the bright and endlessly\r\nvaried hues of flowers, and their sweet perfumes--even their very\r\nproduction--depend on sunlight. In obscure light plants grow lanky and\r\nbecome pale and feeble. They seldom produce flowers, and uniformly\r\nfail to ripen their seeds. In even partial darkness the green hue of\r\ntheir foliage gradually pales and disappears, and new growths, when\r\nthey appear, are blanched or colorless.\r\n\r\nThe best method of keeping the skin clean and healthy, by ablution and\r\nbaths, may here be alluded to. The use of these, and the washing of\r\nthe skin that forms part of the daily duties of the toilet, appear to\r\nbe very simple matters, but writers on the subject differ in opinion\r\nas to the methods to be followed to render them perfect cleansers of\r\nthe skin. Some of them regard the use of soap and water applied in the\r\nform of lather with the hands, and afterwards thoroughly removed from\r\nthe skin by copious affusions, rinsing or sluicing with water, or\r\nimmersion in it, as the best method. This is probably the case when\r\nthe skin is not materially dirty, or its pores or surface obstructed\r\nor loaded with the residual solid matter of the perspiration or its\r\nown unctuous exudation and exuviae. To remove these completely and\r\nreadily, something more than simple friction with the smooth hand is\r\ngenerally required. In such cases the use of a piece of flannel or\r\nserge, doubled and spread across the hand, or of a mitten of the same\r\nmaterial, will be most ready and effective. Friction with this--first\r\nwith soap, and afterwards with water to wash the soap off--will be\r\nfound to cleanse the skin more thoroughly and quickly than any other\r\nmethod, and, by removing the worn-out portion of its surface, to\r\nimpart to it a healthy glow and hue that is most refreshing and\r\nagreeable. This effect will be increased by wiping and rubbing the\r\nsurface thoroughly dry with a coarse and moderately rough, but not a\r\nstiff, towel, instead of with the fine, smooth diapers which are now\r\nso commonly employed. At the bath, the fleshbrush usually provided\r\nthere will supersede the necessity of using the flannel.\r\n\r\nThe small black spots and marks frequently observed on the skin in hot\r\nweather, particularly on the face, generally arise from the\r\naccumulation of the indurated solid matter of the perspiration in its\r\npores. When they assume the form of small pimples (_acne punctata_),\r\nand often when otherwise, they may be removed by strong pressure\r\nbetween the fingers, or between the nails of the opposite fingers,\r\nfollowed by the use of hot, soapy water.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent daily application of a weak solution of bichloride of\r\nmercury--as in the form commonly known as Gowland's lotion--or of\r\nsulphate of zinc, will completely remove the swelling, and generally\r\nprevent their re-formation.\r\n\r\n=Eruptions= are too well known to need any lengthy description here.\r\nThey are usually classified, by writers on the subject, into:\r\nanimalcular eruptions, or those due to the presence of animalcula\r\n(minute acari) in the scarfskin, which occasion much irritation, and\r\nof which the itch furnishes a well-marked example; papular eruptions,\r\nor dry pimples; pustular eruptions, or mattery pimples, of which some\r\nforms are popularly known as crusted tetters; scaly eruptions, or dry\r\ntetters; and vesicular eruptions, or watery pimples.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of all of the above, except the first, in simple cases,\r\nwhere there is not much constitutional disarrangement, consists mainly\r\nin attention to the general principles of health, cleanliness,\r\nexercise, food, ventilation, and clothing. Occasional doses of mild\r\nsaline aperients (Epsom salts, cream of tartar, or phosphate of soda,\r\nor of sulphur combined with cream of tartar) should be taken, and warm\r\nor tepid bathing, preferably in sea-water, or, if not convenient, rain\r\nwater, frequently had recourse to. Stimulants of all kinds should be\r\navoided, and the red meats, ripe fruits, and the antiscorbutic\r\nvegetables should form a considerable portion of the diet. Lemonade,\r\nmade by squeezing the juice of a lemon into a half-pint tumbler full\r\nof water, and sweetening with a little sugar, should be frequently and\r\nliberally taken as one of the best beverages in such cases. To relieve\r\nthe itching and irritation (except in the pustular, crusted, and\r\nvesicular varieties), brisk friction with a fleshbrush or a fleshglove\r\nmay be employed. The parts should also be wetted with an appropriate\r\nlotion after each friction or bath, or the use of soap and water.\r\n\r\nIn all the scaly eruptions, iodide of potassium internally, and\r\nioduretted or sulphuretted lotions or baths are invaluable. In many of\r\nthem of a malignant or obstinate character, as _Lepra Psoriasis_,\r\n_Lupus_, etc., small doses of solution of arsenite of potassa (liquor\r\narsenicalis; the dose, from 3 to 5 drops, gradually and cautiously\r\nincreased to 7 to 9 drops, twice a day, after a meal) prove highly\r\nserviceable. In the forms of psoriasis popularly called baker's itch,\r\ngrocer's itch, and washer-woman's itch, the application of ointment of\r\nnitrate of mercury, diluted with ten or twelve times its weight of\r\nlard, has been highly recommended. A course of sarsaparilla is also in\r\nmost cases advantageous.\r\n\r\nThe small, hard, distinct pimples--\"acne, or acne simplex\" of medical\r\nwriters--that occur on the forehead, and occasionally on the temples\r\nand chin, generally yield to stimulating lotions, consisting of equal\r\nparts of strong vinegar, or spirit, and water, or to weak lotions of\r\nsulphate of zinc, assisted by occasional doses of cooling laxatives,\r\nas the salines, or a mixture of sulphur or cream of tartar.\r\n\r\n=Freckles=, or the round or oval-shaped yellowish or brownish-yellow\r\nspots, resembling stains, common on the face and the backs of the\r\nhands of persons with a fair and delicate skin who are much exposed to\r\nthe direct rays of the sun in hot weather, are of little importance in\r\nthemselves, and have nothing to do with the general health. Ladies who\r\ndesire to remove them may have recourse to the frequent application of\r\ndilute spirit, or lemon juice, or a lotion formed by adding acetic,\r\nhydrochloric, nitric, or sulphuric acid, or liquor of potassa, to\r\nwater, until it is just strong enough to slightly prick the tongue.\r\nOne part of good Jamaica rum to two parts of lemon juice or weak\r\nvinegar is a good form of lotion for the purpose. The effect of all\r\nthese lotions is increased by the addition of a little glycerine.\r\n\r\nThe preceding are also occasionally called \"common freckles,\" \"summer\r\nfreckles,\" and \"sun freckles.\" In some cases they are very persistent,\r\nand resist all attempts to remove them while the exposure that\r\nproduces them is continued. Their appearance may be prevented by the\r\ngreater use of the veil, parasol or sunshade, or avoidance of exposure\r\nto the sun during the heat of the day.\r\n\r\nAnother variety, popularly known as cold freckles, occur at all\r\nseasons of the year, and usually depend on disordered health or some\r\ndisturbance of the natural functions of the skin. Here the only\r\nexternal application that proves useful is the solution of bichloride\r\nof mercury and glycerine, or Gowland's lotion.\r\n\r\n=The Itch=--\"psora\" and \"scabies,\" of medical authors; the \"gale\" of the\r\nFrench,--already referred to, in its common forms is an eruption of\r\nminute vesicles, generally containing animalcula (acari), and of which\r\nthe principal seats are between the fingers, bend of the wrist, etc.\r\nIt is, accompanied by intense itching of the parts affected, which is\r\nonly aggravated by scratching. The usual treatment is with sulphur\r\nointment (simple or compound) well rubbed in once or twice a day; a\r\nspoonful (more or less) of flowers of sulphur, mixed with treacle or\r\nmilk, being taken at the same time, night and morning. Where the\r\nexternal use of sulphur is objectionable, on account of its smell, a\r\nsulphuretten bath or lotion, or one of chloride of lime, may be used\r\ninstead. In all cases extreme cleanliness, with the free use of soap\r\nand water, must be strictly adhered to.\r\n\r\nThe small, soft discolorations and excrescences of the skin, popularly\r\ncalled moles, may be removed by touching them every second or third\r\nday with strong acetic or nitric acid, or with lunar caustic. If\r\ncovered with hair they should be shaved first.\r\n\r\n=Extreme paleness= of the skin, when not symptomatic of any primary\r\ndisease, generally arises from debility, or from the languid\r\ncirculation of the blood at the surface of the body; often, also, from\r\ninsufficient or improper food, want of outdoor exercise, and the like.\r\nThe main treatment is evident. Warm baths, friction, and stimulating\r\nlotions and cosmetics may be here employed, together with a course of\r\nsome mild chalbeate (as the lactate, protophosphate, or\r\nammonia-citrate of iron) and hypophosphate of soda.\r\n\r\n=Roughness and Coarseness= of the skin, when not depending on any\r\nparticular disease, may be removed or greatly lessened by daily\r\nfriction with mild unguents or oil, or by moistening the parts, night\r\nand morning, with a weak solution of bichloride of mercury containing\r\na little glycerine.\r\n\r\n=Rashes and redness= of the skin, of a common character, often arise\r\nfrom very trifling causes, among which indigestion, suppressed\r\nperspiration, irritation, and the like, are the most frequent. Nettle\r\nrash or urticaria, so called from the appearance and tingling\r\nsensations resembling those caused by the sting of nettles, in some\r\npeople, is very apt to follow the use of indigestible and unwholesome\r\nfood. It is usually of short duration and recurrent. The treatment\r\nconsists in the administration of mild saline aperients, and, in\r\nsevere cases, of an emetic, particularly when the stomach is still\r\nloaded with indigestible matter. These should be followed by copious\r\nuse of lemonade made from the fresh expressed juice. The patient\r\nshould be lightly but warmly clothed during the attack, and exposure\r\nto the cold, or to draughts of cold air, should be carefully avoided.\r\nThe further treatment may be similar to that noticed under\r\n\"eruptions.\" To prevent the recurrence of the attack, the\r\nobjectionable articles of food, and any other known exciting causes,\r\nmust be avoided. Red rash, red blotch, or fiery spot, a common\r\nconsequence of disordered health, a sudden fit of dyspepsia, and, in\r\nfemales, of tight lacing, and rose rash, false measles, or roseola,\r\nhaving commonly a similar origin to the preceding, for the most part\r\nrequire the same treatment.\r\n\r\n=Scurf=--\"furfur or furfura\"--is a formation depending on the natural\r\nand healthy exfoliation of the skin on every part of the body on which\r\nhair or down grows, but most extensive and observable on the scalp, on\r\naccount of the abundance and darker color of the hair there.\r\nScurfiness, or excessive scurfiness, is the result of morbid action,\r\nand may be treated by the frequent use of the fleshbrush or hairbrush,\r\nablution with soap and water, and the use of mild stimulating,\r\nastringent, or detergent lotions.\r\n\r\n=Scurvy=--\"scorbutus\" of medical writers--is a disease which, even in\r\nits incipient and early stages, when its presence is often\r\nunsuspected, is most injurious to the skin and complexion. It usually\r\ncommences with unnatural sallowness, debility, and low spirits. As it\r\nproceeds, the gums become sore, spongy, and apt to bleed on the\r\nslightest pressure or friction; the teeth loosen, and the breath\r\nacquires a foetid odor; the legs swell, eruptions appear on\r\ndifferent parts of the body, and at length the patient sinks under\r\ngeneral emaciation, diarrhoea, and hemorrhages. Its chief cause is\r\nimproper food, or, rather, the absence or insufficient supply of fresh\r\nmeat and vegetables in the diet; to which cold, humidity, want of\r\nexercise and fresh air may be added as secondary ones. Hence its\r\nfrequent, fatal visitations formerly on shipboard, and its still\r\noccasional occurrence in ill-victualled ships during long voyages. The\r\ntreatment mainly consists in adopting a liberal diet of fresh animal\r\nfood and green vegetables, with ripe food and an ample allowance of\r\nmild ale or beer, or lemonade made from the fresh expressed juice, as\r\nbeverages. In serious cases, tonics, as quinine and steel, should also\r\nbe administered.\r\n\r\n=Wrinkles= and looseness of the skin depend chiefly on the attenuation\r\nof the cutis or true skin and the reduction in the bulk of the\r\nunderlying surfacial portions of the body. They cannot be regarded as\r\na disease of the skin; but are the result of long continued bad\r\nhealth, anxiety and study, and of general emaciation and old age.\r\nCleanliness, nutritious food, vigorous outdoor exercise, agreeable\r\noccupation of the mind, and an equable and happy temper, retard their\r\nformation. Whatever tends to promote the general health and to\r\nincrease the bulk of the body, and particularly the disposition of fat\r\nin the cellular tissues, also tends to remove them and to increase the\r\nsmoothness and beauty of the skin. The free and frequent use of warm\r\nwater and soap, followed by the daily use of mild, stimulating,\r\ncosmetic lotions or fomentations, or friction with warm oil of a like\r\ncharacter, and cod-liver oil internally, is all that art can do for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\n=Excoriations=, in popular language, are those cases of soreness\r\nproduced by chafing under the arms, behind the ears, and in the\r\nwrinkles and folds of the skin generally. They occur chiefly in\r\ninfancy, and in stout persons with a delicate skin, who perspire\r\nexcessively. Extreme cleanliness, and carefully wiping the parts dry\r\nafter washing, with the subsequent use of a little violet powder, or\r\nfinely powdered starch, or French chalk scraped or grated very fine,\r\ndusted over the parts once or twice a day, will generally remove them\r\nand prevent their recurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         WASHES FOR THE FACE.\r\n\r\nWe do not approve of face washes, but as some ladies will use them, we\r\nrecommend the following as harmless: Dampen with glycerine tempered\r\nwith rose-water, then powder with the finest magnesia. It imparts a\r\ncharming whiteness.\r\n\r\nLess harmless, but more frequently used, is to procure five cents'\r\nworth of bismuth, of flake white, and of powdered chalk; mix with five\r\ncents' worth of rose-water. Great care must be taken to wash off this\r\npreparation before retiring to rest, as the bismuth is of a hurtful\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n=To Remove Freckles.=--Freckles are of two kinds: Those occasioned by\r\nexposure to the sunshine, and consequently evanescent, are denominated\r\n\"summer freckles\"; those which are constitutional and permanent are\r\ncalled \"cold freckles.\" With regard to the latter, it is impossible to\r\ngive any advice which will be of value. They result from causes not to\r\nbe affected by mere external applications. Summer freckles are not\r\ndifficult to deal with, and with a little care the skin may be kept\r\nfree from this cause of disfigurement by using either of the following\r\nlotions:--\r\n\r\nFirst: Scrape horse-radish into a cup of sour milk, let it stand\r\ntwelve hours, strain, and apply two or three times a day.\r\n\r\nSecond: Into half a pint of milk squeeze the juice of a lemon, with a\r\nspoonful of brandy, and boil, skimming well; add a dram of rock alum.\r\nApply freely.\r\n\r\n=Magic Lotion for Removing Freckles.=--Dissolve three grains of borax in\r\nfive drams each of rose-water and orange-flower water. A splendid and\r\nharmless remedy is equal parts of pure glycerine and rose-water,\r\napplied every night and allowed to dry on the skin.\r\n\r\n=To Remove Freckles and Tan.=--Tincture of benzoin, one pint; tincture\r\nof tolu, one-half pint; oil rosemary, one-half ounce. Put one\r\nteaspoonful of the above mixture in one-quarter pint of water, and\r\nthen with a towel thoroughly bathe the face. Do this every night and\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n=To Expel Freckles.=--Finely powdered nitre is excellent. Apply it to\r\nthe face with the finger moistened with water and dipped in the\r\npowder.\r\n\r\n=Cleopatra's Freckle Balm.=--A splendid article. Venice soap, one ounce;\r\nlemon juice, half ounce; oil of bitter almonds, quarter ounce;\r\ndeliquidated oil of tartar, quarter ounce; oil of rhodium, three\r\ndrops. Dissolve the soap in the lemon juice, then add the two oils,\r\nand put the whole in the sun till it acquires the consistency of\r\nointment, and then add the oil rhodium. Anoint the freckly face at\r\nnight with this balm, and wash in the morning with pure water.\r\n\r\n=Lemon Cream for Sunburn and Freckles.=--Put two spoonfuls of sweet\r\ncream into half a pint of new milk, squeeze into it the juice of a\r\nlemon, add half a glass of genuine French brandy, a little alum and\r\nloaf sugar; boil the whole, skim it well, and when cool it is fit for\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n=Wash to Prevent Sunburn.=--Take two drams of borax, one dram of Roman\r\nalum, one dram of camphor, half an ounce of sugar candy, one pound of\r\nox-gall. Mix and stir well together, and repeat the stirring three or\r\nfour times a day until it becomes transparent; then strain it through\r\nfiltering or blotting paper, and it will be fit for use. Wash the face\r\nwith the mixture before you go into the sun.\r\n\r\n=Grape Lotion for Sunburn.=--Dip a bunch of green grapes in a basin of\r\nwater; sprinkle it with powdered alum and salt mixed; wrap the grapes\r\nin paper, and bake them under hot ashes; then express the juice, and\r\nwash the face with the liquid, which will remove either freckles, tan\r\nor sunburn.\r\n\r\n=To Soften and Whiten the Skin--Pate Axerasive of Bozin.=--This\r\ncelebrated perfume has the distinction of being highly commended by\r\nthe French Royal Academy of Medicine. It is better for toilet use than\r\nsoaps, which contain alkali.\r\n\r\nTake powder of bitter almonds, eight ounces; oil of the same, twelve\r\nounces; savon vert of the perfumes, eight ounces; spermaceti, four\r\nounces; soap powder, four ounces; cinnabar, two drams; essence of\r\nrose, one dram. Melt the soap and spermaceti with the oil in a bath\r\nwater; add the powder, and mix the whole in a marble mortar. It forms\r\na paste which softens and whitens the skin better than any soap.\r\n\r\n=To Remove Red Pimples.=--Sulphur water, one ounce; acetated liquor of\r\nammonia, quarter ounce; liquor of potassa, one grain; white wine\r\nvinegar, two ounces; distilled water, two ounces.\r\n\r\n=To Remove Black Specks or Flesh-worms.=--Squeeze them by pressing the\r\nskin, and then wash with warm water and rub well with a towel. Then\r\napply the following lotion: Liquor of potassa, one ounce; cologne, two\r\nounces.\r\n\r\n=Preparation for Whitening the Face and Neck.=--For bleaching and\r\npurifying the skin of the face and neck, making them beautifully\r\nsmooth and white: Terebinth of Mecca, three grains; oil of sweet\r\nalmonds, four ounces; spermaceti, two drams; flour of zinc, one dram;\r\nwhite wax, two drams; rose-water, six drams. Mix in a bath water, and\r\nmelt together. After washing, before retiring (use water as hot as can\r\nbe borne), anoint the face and neck freely with this preparation.\r\n\r\n=To Cure Profuse Perspiration.=--Bathe the hands, feet, and parts of the\r\nbody where the perspiration is greatest, with a cold infusion of\r\nrosemary and sage, and afterwards dust the stockings and\r\nunder-garments with a mixture of two drams of camphor, four ounces of\r\norris root, and sixteen ounces of starch, the whole reduced to a fine\r\npowder. Put the mixture in a coarse muslin bag, and shake it over the\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n=Cleopatra's Enamel for Whitening the Hands and Arms.=--One ounce of\r\nmyrrh, four ounces of honey, two ounces of yellow wax, six ounces of\r\nrose-water. Mix well together the wax, honey and rose-water in a dish\r\nheld over boiling water, and add the myrrh while hot. Rub this thickly\r\nover the skin before going to bed.\r\n\r\n=To Cure Freckles and Parched or Rough Skin.=--Take one ounce of sweet\r\nalmonds, or of pistachia nuts, half a pint of elder or rose-water, and\r\none ounce of pure glycerine; grate the nuts and put the powder in a\r\nlittle linen or cotton bag, and squeeze it for several minutes in the\r\nrose-water; then add the glycerine and a little perfume. Use it by\r\nwetting the face two or three times a day. This is a grateful\r\napplication for a parched, rough skin, and is good for the removal of\r\nfreckles. It should be allowed to dry thoroughly. When it feels pasty\r\nor sticky it may be washed off with a little warm water without soap.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO PURIFY THE BREATH.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more disagreeable to people with whom we associate\r\nthan for them to be able to detect a bad odor from our breath when in\r\ntheir company. Yet a great many are afflicted in this way. The\r\nfollowing will purify and sweeten the breath: Chlorate of lime, seven\r\ndrams; vanilla sugar, three drams; gumeratic, five drams. Mix well\r\nwith warm water to a stiff paste, and cut into lozenges. Take a\r\nlozenge occasionally.\r\n\r\n\r\n          TO BLEACH AND PURIFY THE SKIN OF THE FACE AND NECK.\r\n\r\nA celebrated physician gives the following as a good skin bleacher and\r\npurifier: Half a pint of skim milk; slice into it as much cucumber as\r\nit will cover, and let it stand an hour; then bathe the face, neck,\r\nand hands. Wash them off with clean soft water when the cucumber\r\nextract is dry. If the skin is rough from exposure to the wind, an\r\napplication of buttermilk at night, washed off with fine carbolic soap\r\nin the morning, will make the skin smooth and natural.\r\n\r\n=To Permanently Remove Black Specks or \"Flesh-worms.\"=--Sometimes little\r\nblack specks appear about the base of the nose, or on the forehead, or\r\nin the hollow of the chin, which are called flesh-worms, and are\r\noccasioned by coagulated lymph that obstructs the pores of the skin.\r\nThey may be squeezed out by pressing the skin, and ignorant people\r\nsuppose them to be little worms. They are permanently removed by\r\nwashing with very warm water, and severe friction with a towel and\r\nthen applying a little of the following preparation: Liquor of\r\npotassa, one ounce; cologne, two ounces; white brandy, four ounces.\r\n\r\n=French Face Wash Purifies and Brightens the Complexion.=--Take equal\r\nparts of the seeds of the melon, pumpkin, gourd, and cucumber, pounded\r\ntill they are reduced to powder; add to it sufficient fresh cream to\r\ndilute the flour, and then add milk enough to reduce the whole to a\r\nthick paste. Add a grain of musk and a few drops of the oil of lemon.\r\nAnoint the face with this, leave it on twenty or thirty minutes, or\r\nover night if convenient, and wash off with warm water. It gives a\r\nremarkable purity and brightness to the complexion.\r\n\r\nOr, try this; splendid.--Infuse a handful of well-sifted wheat bran\r\nfor four hours in white wine vinegar; add to it five yolks of eggs and\r\ntwo grains of musk, and distill the whole. Bottle it, keep carefully\r\ncorked for fifteen days, when it will be fit for use. Apply over\r\nnight, and wash in the morning with tepid water.\r\n\r\n=To Remove Pimples.=--There are many kinds of pimples, some of which\r\npartake almost of the nature of ulcers, which require medical\r\ntreatment; but the small red pimple, which is most common, may be\r\nremoved by applying the following twice a day: Sulphur water, one\r\nounce; acetated liquid of ammonia, one-quarter ounce; liquor of\r\npotassa, one grain; white wine vinegar, two ounces; distilled water,\r\ntwo ounces. These pimples are sometimes cured by frequent washing in\r\nwarm water and prolonged friction with a coarse towel. The cause of\r\nthese pimples is obstruction of the skin and imperfect circulation.\r\n\r\n=To Remove Tan.=--_Creme de'l Enclos._--New milk, half a pint; lemon\r\njuice, one-quarter ounce; white brandy, half ounce. Boil the whole and\r\nskim it clear from all scum. Use night and morning.\r\n\r\n=A Cosmetic Bath.=--Take two pounds of barley or bean flour, eight\r\npounds of bran, and a few handfuls of Borage leaves. Boil these\r\ningredients in a sufficient quantity of spring water. This both\r\ncleanses and softens the skin in a superior manner.\r\n\r\n=Kalydor for the Complexion.=--For pimples, freckle-tanned skin, or\r\nscurf on the skin. Take emulsion of bitter almonds, one pint;\r\noxymuriate of quicksilver, two and one-half pints; sal ammoniac, one\r\ndram. To be used moderately by means of a sponge, after washing the\r\nface and hands with pure soap and warm water.\r\n\r\n=To Improve the Skin.=--Take two ounces of Venice soap and dissolve it\r\nin two ounces of lemon juice. Add one ounce of the oil of bitter\r\nalmonds and a like quantity of the oil of tartar. Mix the whole and\r\nstir it well till it has acquired the consistence of soap, and use it\r\nas such for the hands. The paste of sweet almonds, which contains an\r\noil fit for keeping the skin soft and elastic and removing\r\nindurations, may be beneficially applied to the hands and arms.\r\n\r\n=Wash a la Marie Antoinette.=--Gives a beautiful brilliancy to the\r\ncomplexion. Take half a dozen lemons and cut them in small pieces, a\r\nsmall handful of the leaves of white lilies and southernwood, and\r\ninfuse them in two quarts of cows milk, with an ounce and a half of\r\nwhite sugar and an ounce of rock alum. These are to be distilled in\r\npalneum mariae. The face at bedtime is to be rubbed with this liquid,\r\nand it will give a beautiful luster to the complexion. It is a safe\r\napplication, and its effects are certain.\r\n\r\n=Liquid Rouge.=--Harmless--a perfect imitation of nature. For ladies who\r\nwish to use a little artificial bloom the following is recommended. A\r\nliquid rouge to produce a perfect imitation of the colors of nature is\r\nprepared as follows: Add to a pint of French brandy, half an ounce of\r\nbenzoin, an ounce of red sandalwood, half an ounce of Brazil wood and\r\nthe same quantity of rock alum. Cork the bottle carefully, shake it\r\nwell once a day, and at the end of twelve days it will be fit for use.\r\nThe cheeks are to be lightly touched with it.\r\n\r\n=Milk of Roses.=--This is a cosmetic. Pound an ounce of almonds in a\r\nmortar very finely; then put in shavings of honey soap in a small\r\nquantity. Add enough rose-water to enable you to work the composition\r\nwith the pestle into a fine cream; and in order that it may keep, add\r\nto the whole an ounce of spirits of wine, by slow degrees. Scent with\r\notto of roses. Strain through muslin. Apply to the face with a sponge\r\nor a piece of lint.\r\n\r\n=Circassian Cream.=--This celebrated preparation is made, according to a\r\npublished recipe, in this way: Castor oil, one pint; almond oil, four\r\nounces; liquid potassa, three drams; essence of bergamot, oil of\r\ncloves, and oil of lemon, in equal quantities; and about a dozen drops\r\nof otto of roses.\r\n\r\n=Toilet Vinegar.=--Add to the best malt vinegar, half a pint of cognac\r\nand a pint of rose-water. Scent may be added, and if so, it should be\r\nfirst mixed with the spirit before the other ingredients are put in.\r\n\r\n=Bloom Rose.=--This is a preparation of carmine for the face and lips.\r\nTake a quarter of a dram of carmine and place it in a phial with half\r\na dram of liquid ammonia; keep for a few days, occasionally shaking\r\nthe mixture; then dilute with two ounces of rose-water, to which half\r\na dram of essence of roses has been added. Draw off and keep a week or\r\nten days, then apply with the corner of a soft handkerchief, taking\r\ncare that if the color is too bright it is reduced by means of pure\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n=Certain Cure for Eruptions, Pimples, Etc.=--Having in numerous\r\ninstances seen the good effects of the following prescription, I can\r\ncertify to its perfect remedy: Dilute corrosive sublimate with the oil\r\nof almonds, apply it to the face occasionally, and in few days a cure\r\nwill be effected.\r\n\r\n=To Clear the Complexion, and Reduce the Size.=--It is essential that\r\nthe blood should be cleansed. Take a teaspoonful of powdered charcoal,\r\nmixed with water or honey, for three successive nights, then use a\r\nseidlitz powder to remove it from the system. It acts splendidly upon\r\nthe system and purifies the blood; but under no circumstances must the\r\nphysic be neglected to carry the chemicals from the system; if not,\r\nill effects are certain to follow.\r\n\r\n=To Cure and Refine a Stippled or Blotched Skin.=--A small dose of\r\nteraxacum every other night will most materially aid in refining the\r\nskin. It is a month's or six weeks' job to accomplish the desired\r\nresult. You must also wear a mask of quilted cotton, wet in cold\r\nwater, over night. Do not get discouraged, for it is worth the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     TO CURE AND PREVENT WRINKLES.\r\n\r\n=Pomade d'Hebe.=--This pomade is used for the removal of wrinkles. To\r\nmake: Melt white wax, one ounce, to gentle heat; add juice of lily\r\nbulbs, two ounces; add honey, two ounces; rose-water, two drams; and\r\notto of roses, a drop or two. Use twice a day.\r\n\r\n=Lotion for Wrinkles.=--Beautifies the face, preserves the freshness of\r\nyouth, and gives a beautiful brilliancy to the skin. Take the second\r\nwater of barley, one pint, and strain through a piece of fine linen;\r\nadd a dozen drops of the balm of Mecca; shake it well together until\r\nthe balm is thoroughly incorporated with the water, which will be\r\neffected when the water assumes a whitish or turgid appearance. Before\r\napplying, wash the face with soft water. If used once a day, this\r\nlotion will beautify the face, remove wrinkles, preserve the freshness\r\nof youth, and give a surprising brilliancy to the skin.\r\n\r\n=Wash for Wrinkles.=--Take two ounces of the juice of onions, two ounces\r\nof the white lily, two ounces of Norboune honey, and one ounce of\r\nwhite wax; put the whole into a new earthen pipkin until the wax is\r\nmelted, then take the pipkin (crock) off the fire, and continue\r\nstirring briskly until the mixture grows cold. This should be applied\r\non going to bed and allowed to remain on till the morning.\r\n\r\n=To Remove Wrinkles.=--To one fluid ounce of tincture of gum benzoin add\r\nseven fluid ounces of distilled rose-water and one-half ounce of\r\nglycerine. Bathe face, neck, and hands with it at night, letting it\r\ndry on. Wash off in the morning with a very little pure white castile\r\nsoap and soft water. This is a famous cosmetic, and has been sold\r\nunder various names. It is an excellent remedy for tan, freckles, and\r\nsunburn also.\r\n\r\n\r\n                HOW TO HAVE BRILLIANT, BEAUTIFUL EYES.\r\n\r\nBeautiful eyes are the gift of nature; but even those of the greatest\r\nbeauty may owe something to the toilet, while those of an indifferent\r\nkind are very susceptible of improvement. We entirely discountenance\r\nany tampering with the eye itself, with a view to giving it luster or\r\nbrightness. The sight has often been injured by the use of belladonna,\r\npreparations of the calabar bean, eyebright, and other substances\r\nhaving a strong effect on the eyes. But without touching the eye\r\nitself, it is possible to give the effect of brightness, softness,\r\netc., by means of the eyelids and eyelashes. Made-up eyes are by no\r\nmeans desirable, and to many are singularly displeasing; but the same\r\nmay be said of made-up faces generally. Some ladies are, however,\r\npersuaded that it adds to their charms to give the eyes a long, almond\r\nshape--after the Egyptian type--while very many are persuaded that the\r\neye is not seen to advantage unless its apparent size is increased by\r\nthe darkening of the lids. Both these effects are produced by kohl, a\r\nblack powder, which may be procured at the chemist's, and is mixed\r\nwith rose-water and applied with a camel's-hair brush.\r\n\r\n=To Cure Weak Eyes.=--It is well to have on the toilet table a remedy\r\nfor inflamed eyes. Spermaceti ointment is simple and well adapted for\r\nthe purpose. Apply at night, and wash off with rose-water in the\r\nmorning. Golden ointment will serve a like purpose. Or, there is a\r\nsimple lotion made by dissolving a very small piece of alum and a\r\npiece of lump sugar of the same size in a quart of water. Put the\r\ningredients into water cold and let them simmer. Bathe the eyes\r\nfrequently with it. Sties in the eyes are irritating and disfiguring.\r\nFoment with warm water; at night apply a bread and milk poultice. When\r\na white head forms, prick it with a fine needle. Should the\r\ninflammation be obstinate, a little citerine ointment may be applied,\r\ncare being taken that it does not get into the eye, and an aperient\r\nshould be tried.\r\n\r\n=To Improve the Eyelashes.=--Many people speak highly of this secret.\r\nTrim the tiny points slightly, and anoint with this salve: Two drams\r\nof ointment of nitric oxida of mercury, and one dram of lard. Mix the\r\nlard and ointment well, and anoint the edges of the eyelids night and\r\nmorning, after each time, with milk and water. This will restore the\r\nlashes when all other remedies fail. It is not known in this country,\r\nand is a valuable secret.\r\n\r\n=To Cure Weakness of Eyes.=--Sulphate of copper, fifteen grains;\r\ncamphor, four grains; boiling water, four ounces. Mix, strain, and\r\nwhen cold make up to four pints with water. Bathe the eyes night and\r\nmorning with a portion of the mixture.\r\n\r\n=How to Have Beautiful Eyelashes.=--The effect of the eyes is greatly\r\naided by beautiful eyelashes. These may be secured to a certain extent\r\nby a little care, especially if it is taken early in life. The extreme\r\nends should be cut with a pair of small, sharp scissors, care being\r\ntaken to preserve the natural outline, not to leave jagged edges.\r\nAttention to this matter results in the lengthening of the lashes.\r\nDyeing them is another expedient often resorted to for increasing\r\ntheir effect. A good permanent black is all that is needed, and for\r\nthis use Indian ink. As an impromptu expedient to serve for one night,\r\na hairpin held for a few seconds in the flame of a candle, and drawn\r\nthrough the lashes, will serve to color them well, and with sufficient\r\ndurability. It need scarcely be added that the hairpin must be\r\nsuffered to grow cold before it is used, or the consequence may be\r\nthat no eyelash will be left to color. Good eyebrows are not to be\r\nproduced artificially. It is possible, however, to prevent those that\r\nare really good from degenerating through neglect. When wiping the\r\nface dry after washing, pass a corner of the towel over the forefinger\r\nand set the eyebrows in the form you wish them to assume. And when\r\noiling the hair, do not forget to oil the eyebrows also.\r\n\r\n=To Cure Watery and Inflamed Eyes.=--Foment frequently with decoction of\r\npoppy heads. When the irritation and inflammation occur, a teaspoonful\r\nof cognac brandy in four ounces of spring water may be used three or\r\nfour times in the course of the day as a strengthening lotion.\r\n\r\n=General Care of the Eyes.=--The eyes, of all the features, stand\r\npre-eminent for their beauty and ever-varying powers of expression,\r\nand for being the organs of the most exalted, delicate and useful of\r\nthe senses. It is they alone that \"reveal the external forms of beauty\r\nto the mind, and enable it to perceive them, even at a distance, with\r\nthe speed of light. It is they alone that clothe the whole creation\r\nwith the magic charms of color, and fix on every object the identity\r\nof figure. It is the eyes alone, or chiefly, that reveal the emotions\r\nof the mind to others, and that clothe the features with the language\r\nof the soul. Melting with pity, or glowing with hope, or redolent with\r\nlove, benevolence, desire, or emulation, they impart to the\r\ncountenance those vital fascinations which are the peculiar attributes\r\nof man.\" \"And when the mind is subdued by fear, anxiety or shame, or\r\noverwhelmed by sorrow or despair, the eyes, like faithful chroniclers,\r\nstill tell the truthful story of the mental disquietude. And hatred,\r\nanger, envy, pride, and jealousy, ambition, avarice, discontent, and\r\nall the varied passions and emotions that torment, excite or depress\r\nthe human soul, and find a resting place in the human breast, obtain\r\nexpression in the eyes. At one moment the instruments of receiving and\r\nimparting pleasure, at another the willing or passive instruments of\r\npain, their influences and changes are as varied and boundless as the\r\nempire of thought itself.\" Through their silent expressions the mind\r\nreveals its workings to the external world in signs more rapid and as\r\npalpable as those uttered by the tongue. It is \"the eyes alone that\r\nstamp the face with the outward symbol of animation and vitality,\" and\r\nwhich endue it with the visible \"sanctity of reason.\" The eye is,\r\nindeed, the chief and most speaking feature of the face, and the one\r\non whose excellence, more than any other, its beauty depends.\r\n\r\nTheories have been based on even the peculiar color of the eyes. Thus,\r\nit is said that dark blue eyes are found chiefly in persons of\r\ndelicate, refined or effeminate mental character; light blue eyes, and\r\nmore particularly gray eyes, in the hardy and active; hazel eyes, in\r\nthe masculine, vigorous, and profound; black eyes, in those whose\r\nenergy is of a desultory or remittent character, and who exhibit\r\nfickleness in pursuits and affection. Greenish eyes, it is asserted,\r\nhave the same general meaning as gray eyes, with the addition of\r\nselfishness or a sinistrous disposition. These statements, however,\r\nthough based on some general truths, and supported by popular opinion,\r\nare liable to so many exceptions as to be unreliable and valueless in\r\ntheir individual applications.\r\n\r\nShakespeare is said to have had hazel eyes; Swift, blue eyes; Milton,\r\nScott, and Byron, gray eyes. Wellington and Napoleon are also said to\r\nhave had gray eyes.\r\n\r\nA beautiful eye is one that is full, clear, and brilliant; appropriate\r\nin color to the complexion, and in form to the features, and of which\r\nthe connected parts--the eyelids, eyelashes, and eyebrows, which, with\r\nit, in a general view of the subject, collectively form the external\r\neye--are also beautiful, and in keeping with it.\r\n\r\nTo increase the beauty and expression of the eyes, various means are\r\noccasionally had recourse to, nearly all of which, except those herein\r\nmentioned in connection with the eyelashes and eyebrows, are not\r\nmerely highly objectionable, but even dangerous. Thus, some\r\nfashionable ladies and actresses, to enhance the clearness and\r\nbrilliancy of their eyes before appearing in public, are in the habit\r\nof exposing them to air slightly impregnated with the vapor of prussic\r\nacid. This is done by placing a single drop of the dilute acid at the\r\nbottom of an eyecup or eyeglass, and then holding the cup or glass\r\nagainst the eye for a few seconds, with the head in an inclined\r\nposition. It has also been asserted, and I believe correctly, that\r\ncertain ladies of the demimonde rub a very small quantity of\r\nbelladonna ointment on the brow over each eye, or moisten the same\r\npart with a few drops of tincture of belladonna. This produces\r\ndilation of the pupil, and gives that peculiar fullness and an\r\nexpression of languor to the eyes which, by some, is regarded as\r\nexceedingly fascinating. The use of these active medicinals in this\r\nway must be manifestly injurious; and when frequent, or long continued\r\nor carried to excess, must necessarily result in impaired vision, if\r\nnot in actual blindness.\r\n\r\nThe following means of repairing and restoring the sight, which has\r\nfor some time been going the round of the press, being based on\r\nscientific principles, may be appropriately inserted here:\r\n\r\nFor nearsightedness, close the eyes and pass the fingers, very gently,\r\nseveral times across them outward, from the canthus, or corner next\r\nthe nose, towards the temple. This tends slightly to flatten the\r\ncorner and lens of the eye, and thus to lengthen or extend the angle\r\nof vision. The operation should be repeated several times a day, or at\r\nleast always after making one's toilet, until shortsightedness is\r\nnearly or completely removed. For long sight, loss of sight by age,\r\nweak sight, and generally for all those defects which require the use\r\nof magnifying glasses, gently pass the finger, or napkin, from the\r\nouter angle or corner of the eyes inward, above and below the eyeball,\r\ntowards the nose. This tends slightly to \"round up\" the eyes, and thus\r\nto preserve or to restore the sight. It should be done every time the\r\neyes are washed, or oftener.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL MOUTH AND LIPS.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the human mouth and lips, the delicacy of their\r\nformation and tints, their power of expression, which is only inferior\r\nto that of the eyes, and their elevated position as the media with the\r\npalate, tongue, and teeth, by which we communicate our thoughts to\r\nothers in an audible form, need scarcely be dilated on here. The poet\r\ntells us that:\r\n\r\n    \"The lips of woman out of roses take\r\n    The tints with which they ever stain themselves.\r\n    They are the beautiful, lofty shelves\r\n    Where rests the sweetness which the young hours make,\r\n    And which the earnest boy, whom we call Love,\r\n    Will often sip in sorrow or in play.\r\n    Health, when it comes, doth ruddiness approve,\r\n    But his strong foe soon flatters it away!\r\n    Disease and health for a warm pair of lips,\r\n    Like York and Lancaster, wage active strife:\r\n    One on his banner front the White rose keeps,\r\n    And one the Red; and thus with woman's life,\r\n    Her lips are made a battle-field for those\r\n    Who struggle for the color of a rose.\"\r\n\r\nA beautiful mouth is one that is moderately small, and has a\r\nwell-defined and graceful outline; and beautiful lips are gracefully\r\nmolded, neither thick nor thin, nor compressed nor lax, and that are\r\nendowed with expression and are tinted with the hues of health.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of Eastern nations commonly heighten the hue and freshness\r\nof their lips by means of cosmetics, a practice which in Western\r\nEurope is only adopted on the stage, and occasionally by courtesans\r\nand ladies of the demimonde.\r\n\r\nChapped lips most frequently occur in persons with pale, bluish, moist\r\nlips and a languid circulation, who are much exposed to the wind or\r\nwho are continually moving from heated apartments to the external air.\r\nEast and north-east winds are those that generally produce them. The\r\noccasional application of a little cold cream, lip salve, spermaceti\r\nointment, or any other mild unguent, will generally prevent them, and\r\nremove them when they have already formed. A still more elegant and\r\neffective preventive and remedy is glycerine diluted with about twice\r\nits weight of eau-de-rose, or glycerinated lip salve or balsam.\r\n\r\nThe moist vesicular eruption of the lips, referred to above, may also\r\ngenerally be prevented by the use of glycerine, or any of the\r\npreparations just mentioned. After its accession, the best treatment\r\nis to freely dust the affected portion of the lips with violet powder,\r\nfinely powdered starch, prepared chalk, or French chalk or talc\r\nreduced to an impalpable powder by scraping or grating it.\r\n\r\nThe following formulas of preparations are all valuable for\r\nbeautifying and preserving the beauty of the lips:--\r\n\r\n=White Lip Salve--No. 1.=--Take half a pound spermaceti ointment,\r\nliquify it by the heat of warm water, and stir in one-half dram neroli\r\nor essence de petit-grain. In a few minutes pour off the clear portion\r\nfrom the dregs (if any) and add twenty drops of oil of rose. Lastly,\r\nbefore it cools, pour it into jars.\r\n\r\n=Lip Salve--No. 2.=--This indispensable adjunct to the toilet is made by\r\nmelting in a jar, placed in a basin of boiling water, a quarter of an\r\nounce each of white wax and spermaceti; flour of benzoin, fifteen\r\ngrains; and half an ounce of oil of almonds. Stir till the mixture is\r\ncool. Color red with two-penny worth of alkanet root. Splendid for\r\nkeeping the lips healthy and of a beautiful crimson color.\r\n\r\n=French Lip Salve.=--Lard, twenty-six ounces; white wax, two ounces;\r\nnitre and alum in fine powder, of each one-half ounce; alkanet to\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n=German Lip Salve.=--Butter of cacao, one-half ounce; oil of almonds,\r\none-quarter ounce; melt together with a gentle heat, and add six drops\r\nof essence of lemon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE CARE OF THE TEETH.\r\n\r\nThe influence which the teeth are capable of exercising on the\r\npersonal appearance is usually known and admitted.\r\n\r\nThe teeth have formed especial objects of attention, in connection\r\nwith the toilet and cosmetic arts, from almost the earliest ages of\r\nthe world to the present time. History and tradition, and the\r\nresearches of archaeologists among the remains of the prehistoric\r\nnations of the East, show us that even dentistry may trace back its\r\norigin to a date not very long subsequent to the \"confusion of\r\ntongues.\"\r\n\r\nWe are told that the ancient Welsh took particular care of their\r\nteeth, by frequently rubbing them with a stick of green hazel and a\r\nwoollen cloth. To prevent their premature decay, they scrupulously\r\navoided acid liquids, and invariably abstained from all hot food and\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nEuropeans pride themselves on teeth of pearly whiteness; but many\r\nAsiatic nations regard them as beautiful only when of a black color.\r\nThe Chinese, in order to blacken them, chew what is called \"betel\" or\r\n\"betel nut,\" a common masticatory in the East. The Siamese and the\r\nTonquinese do the same, but to a still greater extent, which renders\r\ntheir teeth as black as ebony, or more so. As the use of the\r\nmasticatory is generally not commenced until a certain age, the common\r\npractice is to stain the teeth of the boys and girls with a strong\r\npreparation of it, on the former attaining the age of ten or twelve.\r\n\r\nKeeping the lips apart and breathing through the mouth instead of the\r\nnose, and, particularly, sleeping with the mouth open, are habits\r\nwhich are very prejudicial to the teeth and gums. In this way the\r\nmouth forms a trap to catch the dust and gritty particles floating in\r\nthe atmosphere, which soon mechanically injure the enamel of the teeth\r\nby attrition.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of cleanliness in connection with the teeth and mouth,\r\nit may be said that the mouth cannot be too frequently rinsed during\r\nthe day, and that it should be more particularly so treated after each\r\nmeal. Pure cold water is the best for the purpose. It not only cleans\r\nthe teeth and mouth, but exerts a tonic action on the gums, which warm\r\nwater, or even tepid water, is deficient in. When cold water cannot be\r\ntolerated, tepid water may be employed, the temperature being slightly\r\nlowered once every week or ten days until cold water can be borne.\r\nEvery one who abhors a foetid breath, rotten teeth, and the\r\ntoothache, would do well to thoroughly clean his teeth at bedtime,\r\nobserving to well rinse the mouth with cold water on rising in the\r\nmorning, and again in the day once, or oftener, as the opportunities\r\noccur. With smokers, the use of the toothbrush the last thing at night\r\nis almost obligatory if they value their teeth and wish to avoid the\r\nunpleasant flavor and sensation which teeth fouled with tobacco smoke\r\noccasion in the mouth on awakening in the morning.\r\n\r\nAs to tooth powders or pastes to be used with the brush, the simplest\r\nare the best. Plain camphorated chalk, with or without a little finely\r\npowdered pumice stone or burnt hartshorn, is a popular and excellent\r\ntooth powder. It is capable of exerting sufficient friction under the\r\nbrush to ensure pearly whiteness of the teeth without injuring the\r\nenamel, whilst the camphor in it tends to destroy the animalcula in\r\nthe secretions of the mouth, whose skeletons or remains constitute, as\r\nwe shall presently see, the incrassation popularly called \"tartar.\"\r\nRecently-burnt charcoal, in very fine powder, is another excellent\r\ntooth powder, which, without injuring the enamel, is sufficiently\r\ngritty to clean the teeth and remove the tartar from them, and\r\npossesses the advantage of also removing the offensive odor arising\r\nfrom rotten teeth and from decomposing organic matter. The charcoal of\r\nthe heavy hardwoods, as lignum-vitae, boxwood, oak, are the best; and\r\nthese, as to quality, range in the order given. Still more valuable as\r\na dentifrice is areca nut charcoal, which, besides possessing the\r\nproperties of the other vegetable charcoals in an eminent degree, has\r\nvaluable ones peculiar to itself.\r\n\r\nSome dentists, and some persons in imitation of them, in order to\r\nwhiten the teeth, rub their surfaces with hydrochloric acid, somewhat\r\ndilute; but the practice is a most dangerous one, which, by a few\r\nrepetitions, will sometimes utterly destroy the enamel and lead to the\r\nrapid decay of all the teeth so treated. Should the teeth be much\r\ndiscolored, and ordinary tooth powder prove ineffective, a little\r\nlemon juice used with the brush will generally render them perfectly\r\nwhite. It should only be employed occasionally, and the mouth should\r\nbe well rinsed with water afterwards. A little of the pulp of an\r\norange, used in the same way, is also very effective and safe, as are\r\nalso ripe strawberries, which may be either rubbed on the teeth with\r\nthe fingers or applied with the brush. The last form, perhaps, the\r\nvery best natural dentifrice known. Besides possessing singular power\r\nin whitening and cleaning the teeth and rapidly removing tartar, they\r\ndestroy the offensive odor of rotten teeth and impart an agreeable\r\nfragrance to the breath.\r\n\r\nThe importance of a judicious attention to the teeth, in connection\r\nwith health, cleanliness, and personal comfort and appearance, cannot\r\nbe too often alluded to and enforced.\r\n\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that, taking the whole community, there\r\nare few, very few, who clean their teeth, or even wash their mouths,\r\nonce a day. With the masses the operation, if performed at all, is\r\nconfined to the Sabbath day, or to holidays; whilst refined, educated,\r\nand cleanly persons regard the operation of cleaning the teeth as a\r\ndaily duty, as necessary as washing the face and hands. The dirty and\r\nvulgar--the two words are here synonymous--wholly neglect it, and too\r\noften even consider it as unnecessary, effeminate, and absurd. The\r\nconsequences of the careless performance, or the neglect, of this\r\nreally necessary personal duty are not long in being developed.\r\nPassing over the degradation of the other features, the offensiveness\r\nof the breath, often to a degree which renders the individual\r\nuncompanionable, and the unfavorable impression which, like other\r\nmarks of uncleanliness, they convey of the taste and habits of their\r\npossessor, as the immediate effects of habitually neglected and dirty\r\nteeth, let us look at the more distant, but not less certain, ones:--\r\n\r\nIn cases of ordinary toothache, even severe ones, chewing a small\r\npiece of really good pellitory will often give relief in a few\r\nminutes. Chewing a piece of strong, unbleached Jamaica ginger will\r\noften do the same in light cases. The celebrated John Wesley\r\nrecommended a \"few whiffs\" at a pipe containing a little caraway seed\r\nmixed with tobacco as a simple and ready means of curing the\r\ntoothache. I can bear testimony to the fact that in some cases it\r\nsucceeds admirably.\r\n\r\nScarcely anything is more disagreeable, and in marked cases, more\r\ndisgusting, than foetid breath. It is unpleasant to the person that\r\nhas it, and it renders him unfit for the society of others. The cause\r\nof stinking breath may generally be traced to rotten teeth, diseased\r\nstomach, or worms. When the first are the cause, the teeth should be\r\nthoroughly cleansed and then \"stopped\" in the manner already\r\nindicated; or, when this is impracticable, the offending tooth, or\r\nteeth, may be removed and replaced by artificial ones. When this\r\ncannot be done, or is inconvenient, the evil may be greatly lessened\r\nby the frequent use of an antiseptic tooth powder, areca nut charcoal\r\nor camphorated chalk. Dirty teeth, even when quite sound, always more\r\nor less taint the breath. When a foul or a diseased stomach is the\r\ncause, mild aperients should be administered; and if these do not\r\nsucceed, an emetic may be given, scrupulous cleanliness of the teeth\r\nbeing observed, as in the former case. When worms are the cause, worm\r\nmedicine, under medical direction, will be necessary.\r\n\r\n=To Cure Foul Breath.=--When bad breath is occasioned by teeth, or any\r\nlocal cause, use a gargle consisting of a spoonful of solution of\r\nchloride of lime in half a tumbler of water.\r\n\r\n=To Have White and Beautiful Teeth.=--An article known as \"The Queen's\r\nTooth Preserver\" is made as follows: One ounce of coarsely powdered\r\nPeruvian bark, mixed in half a pint of brandy for twelve days. Gargle\r\nthe mouth (teeth and gums) with a teaspoonful of this liquid, diluted\r\nwith an equal quantity of rose-water. Always wash off the teeth after\r\neach meal with water. Also, twice a day, wash the teeth with the ashes\r\nof burned bread--bread burned to ashes.\r\n\r\n=For Decayed Teeth.=--There is nothing better than two scruples of myrrh\r\nin fine powder, one scruple of juniper gum, and ten grains of alum,\r\nmixed in honey. Apply often to the teeth.\r\n\r\n=To Cure Toothache.=--Take equal parts of camphor, sulphuric ether,\r\nammonia, laudanum, tincture of cayenne, and one-eighth part oil of\r\ncloves. Mix well together. Saturate with the liquid a small piece of\r\ncotton, and apply to the cavity of the diseased tooth, and the pain\r\nwill cease immediately.\r\n\r\n=Premium Tooth Powder.=--Six ounces prepared chalk, one-half ounce\r\ncassia powder, one ounce orris; mix well.\r\n\r\n=Mouth Pastilles for Perfuming the Breath.=--First: Extract of\r\nliquorice, three ounces; oil of cloves, one and a half drams; oil of\r\ncinnamon, fifteen drops. Mix, and divide into one-grain pills.\r\n\r\nSecond: Catechu, seven drams; orris powder, forty grains; sugar, three\r\nounces; oil of rosemary (or of cloves, peppermint, or cinnamon), four\r\ndrops. Mix, and roll flat on oiled marble slab, and cut into very\r\nsmall tablets.\r\n\r\n=Feuchtwanger's Tooth Paste.=--Powdered myrrh, two ounces; burned alum,\r\none ounce; cream tartar, one ounce; cuttlefish bone, four ounces; drop\r\nlake, two ounces; honey, half a gallon. Mix. Reduce the proportion for\r\na small quantity.\r\n\r\n=Fine Tooth Powder.=--Powdered orris root, one ounce; Peruvian bark, one\r\nounce; prepared chalk, one ounce; myrrh, one-half ounce. Mix.\r\n\r\n=To Remove Offensive Breath.=--For this purpose, almost the only\r\nsubstance that should be admitted to the toilet is the concentrated\r\nsolution of chloride of soda. From six to ten drops of it in a\r\nwineglassful of spring water, taken immediately after the operations\r\nof the toilet are completed.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the odor arising from caries is combined with that of\r\nthe stomach. If the mouth be well rinsed with a teaspoonful of the\r\nsolution of the chloride in a tumbler of water, the bad odor of the\r\nteeth will be removed.\r\n\r\n=Rye Tooth Powder.=--Rye contains carbonate of lime, carbonate of\r\nmagnesia, oxide of iron, manganese, and silica, all suitable for\r\napplication to the teeth. Therefore, a fine tooth powder is made by\r\nburning rye, or rye bread, to ashes, and grinding it to powder by\r\npassing the rolling-pin over it. Pass the powder through a sieve, and\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n=Camphorated Chalk.=--This favorite tooth powder is easily made. Take a\r\npound of prepared chalk, and with this mix two drams of camphor very\r\nfinely powdered, and moisten with spirits of wine. Thoroughly mix.\r\n\r\n=To Remove the Yellow Color from Teeth.=--Take of dry hypochlorite of\r\nlime, one-half dram; red coral, two drams. Tincturate and mix\r\nthoroughly. This powder is employed in the following manner: A new\r\nbrush is slightly moistened, then dipped in the powder and applied to\r\nthe teeth. A few days after the use of this powder the teeth will\r\nacquire a beautiful white color.\r\n\r\n=Camphor Paste.=--Take one ounce of oil ammoniac, four drams of camphor.\r\nLet the above be very finely powdered, then mix it with sufficient\r\nhoney to make it into a smooth paste; triturate it until entirely\r\nsmooth. This is a most excellent paste for preserving and beautifying\r\nthe teeth.\r\n\r\n=Preservative Tincture for the Teeth and Gums.=--Take four drams of\r\ncamphor, one ounce of tincture of myrrh, one ounce of tincture of\r\nbark, and one ounce of rectified spirits of wine; mix them, and put 30\r\nor 40 drops in a wineglassful of water. Pour a little of this upon\r\nyour brush before you apply it to the powder, and when the teeth are\r\nclean, wash the mouth, teeth, and gums with the remainder. It will in\r\nordinary cases prevent toothache.\r\n\r\n=Powerfully Cleansing Dentifrice.=--Take fine powder of pumice stone,\r\nfour drams; fine powder of cuttlefish bone, four drams; add one\r\nscruple of subcarbonate of soda. Mix them well together, color and\r\nscent according to taste, and then pass it through a fine sieve.\r\n\r\n=Infallible Cure for Toothache.=--Take alum, reduced to an impalpable\r\npowder, two drams; nitreous spirits of ether, seven drams. Mix, and\r\napply them to the tooth. This is said to be an infallible cure for all\r\nkinds of toothache, unless the disease is connected with rheumatism.\r\n\r\n=Mixture for Decayed Teeth.=--Make a balsam with a sufficient quantity\r\nof honey, two scruples of myrrh in fine powder, a scruple of gum\r\njuniper, and ten grains of rock alum. A portion to be applied\r\nfrequently to the decayed tooth.\r\n\r\n=To Whiten and Beautify the Teeth.=--Take gum tragacanth, one ounce;\r\npumice stone, two drams; gum arabic, one ounce; cream of tartar, one\r\nounce. Dissolve the gums in rose-water, and adding to it the powder,\r\nform the whole into little sticks, which are to be dried slowly in the\r\nshade, and afterwards kept for use. Use on the brush like soap.\r\n\r\n\r\n             HOW TO HAVE SOFT, WHITE AND BEAUTIFUL HANDS.\r\n\r\nThere are very few beautiful hands, but to make the hands beautiful\r\nrests, with scarcely an exception, with the possessor. Now that\r\nchiromancy has become so fashionable as to be a part of a great many\r\nentertainments, it is very desirable that the hands should present an\r\nattractive appearance. A soft, white, delicate hand, with neatly-kept\r\nnails, forms an important factor in a pleasing personal appearance,\r\nand is something any man or woman may possess themselves of with a\r\nlittle care. Of course it goes without saying, that requisite is\r\nperfect cleanliness of both the hands and nails. The best and purest\r\nsoap should be used, and when soft water cannot be obtained, a few\r\ndrops of ammonia, or a little borax, should be added to the water in\r\nwhich the hands are washed, and they should always be thoroughly\r\ndried. A lotion of one ounce glycerine, one ounce rose-water, ten\r\ndrops of carbolic acid, and forty drops of hamamelis, is excellent to\r\nuse on the hands before they are dried each time they are washed.\r\n\r\nPersons who do housework should wear the India rubber gloves which are\r\nmade for the purpose and can be purchased in any size for from $1.00\r\nto $1.25 as they are with or without wrists.\r\n\r\nRubbing the hands once or twice a day in oatmeal tends to whiten them\r\nand make them soft and flexible.\r\n\r\nThe following bleaches the hands and arms and makes them beautifully\r\nsoft and white:--\r\n\r\n=Bleaching Lotion.=--Bitter almonds, ten ounces; iris powder, one ounce;\r\npulverized horse-chestnut, two ounces; essence of bergamot, one dram;\r\ncarbonate of potash, two drams; mix. Use on the hands after washing,\r\nand on retiring for the night.\r\n\r\nFive grains of chloridated lime in a pint of warm water will whiten\r\nthe hands and remove all stains, but as this is not always quite\r\nharmless to a delicate skin, it is perhaps better to remove stains\r\nwith a cut of lemon, and use the preparation given above for whitening\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTight lacing and tight sleeves, and even tight shoes, will cause the\r\nhands to be an unsightly red, for which no lotion or care is a remedy.\r\nIf, however, all the clothing is worn so as to allow a free\r\ncirculation, and the directions which have been given are regularly\r\nand constantly followed, any hand will become white, supple and\r\ndelicate--a pleasure to both possessor and beholder; and it is really\r\nworth the care, which after a little time becomes a fixed habit and so\r\nis scarcely noticeable, to have such hands.\r\n\r\n=To Make the Hands White and Delicate.=--Should you wish to make your\r\nhands white and delicate, wash them in hot milk and water for a day or\r\ntwo. On retiring to rest, rub them well over with palm oil, and put on\r\na pair of woollen gloves. The hands should be thoroughly washed with\r\nhot water and soap the next morning, and a pair of soft leather gloves\r\nworn during the day; they should be frequently rubbed together to\r\npromote circulation. Sunburnt hands should be washed in lime water or\r\nlemon juice. Should they be severely freckled, the following will be\r\ngood to use: Take of distilled water, half a pint; sal ammoniac, half\r\na dram; oxymuriate of quicksilver, four grains; divide the two last in\r\nspirit, and gradually add the water to them; add another half pint of\r\nwater, mix well together, and it is ready for use. It should be\r\napplied as often as desirable, with a piece of soft sponge. If\r\nrose-water is substituted for distilled water, the effect is\r\npleasanter.\r\n\r\n=Remedy for Chapped Hands.=--The simplest remedy is the camphor ball, to\r\nbe obtained of all chemists. Powdered hemlock bark put into a piece of\r\nmuslin and sprinkled on the chaps is highly recommended. Or, wash with\r\noatmeal, and afterwards rub the hands over with dry oatmeal, so as to\r\nremove all dampness. It is a good thing to rub the hands and lips with\r\nglycerine before going to bed at night. A good oil is made by\r\nsimmering: Sweet oil, one pint; Venice turpentine, three ounces; lard,\r\nhalf a pound; beeswax, three ounces. Simmer till the wax is melted.\r\nRub on, or apply with a rag.\r\n\r\n=To Cure Red Hands.=--Wash them frequently in warm, not hot, water,\r\nusing honey soap and soft towel. Dry with violet powder, and again\r\nwith a soft, dry handkerchief. Take exercise enough to promote\r\ncirculation, and do not wear gloves too tight.\r\n\r\n=Almond Paste for the Hands.=--Take one pound of sweet almonds,\r\none-quarter of a pound of bread crumbs, one half a pint of spring\r\nwater, one-half a pint of brandy, and the yolks of two eggs. Pound the\r\nalmonds with a few drops of vinegar or water, to prevent them oiling;\r\nadd the crumbs of bread, which moisten with the brandy as you mix it\r\nwith the almonds and the yolks of eggs. Set this mixture over a slow\r\nfire, and stir it continually or it will adhere to the edges.\r\n\r\n=Almond Paste for Chapped Hands= (which will preserve them smooth and\r\nwhite).--The daily use of the following paste will keep the hands\r\nsmooth and white: Mix a quarter of a pound of unsalted hog's lard,\r\nwhich has been washed in common, and then in rose, water, with the\r\nyolks of two fresh eggs and a large spoonful of honey. Add as much\r\npaste from almonds (well pounded in a mortar) as will work it into a\r\npaste.\r\n\r\n=General Remarks.=--The human hand, regarded either with reference to\r\nits ingenious construction and usefulness, or to its beauty, stands\r\nalone, in its superlative excellence, in the whole animal world. In no\r\nspecies of animal is the hand so wonderfully formed and so perfectly\r\ndeveloped as in man.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the delicacy and beauty of the hands, some little care,\r\nand more than that which is ordinarily bestowed on them, is required.\r\nForemost in consideration must be the subject of cleanliness. Dirty\r\nand coarse hands are no less marks of slothfulness and lowbreeding\r\nthan clean and delicate hands are of refinement and gentility. To\r\npromote softness and whiteness of the skin, mild emollient soaps, or\r\nthose abounding in oil or fat, should alone be adopted for common use;\r\nby which means the tendency to contract chaps and chilblains, and\r\nroughness from drying winds, will also be lessened. The coarse, strong\r\nkinds of soap, those abounding in alkali, should be rejected, as they\r\ntend to render the skin rough, dry and brittle. Rain, or soft, water\r\nis the best natural water for washing the hands, as it cleanses them\r\nmore rapidly and completely than ordinary hard water, and with the use\r\nof less soap. It may be advantageously used tepid, or even warm; but\r\nhot water should be avoided. Distilled water, when obtainable, is\r\npreferable to even rain water. In the absence of these, water that\r\nhas been boiled and allowed to settle and cool may be employed. With\r\nhard water the hands are cleansed with difficulty, and though it may\r\nbe readily softened by the addition of a little soda, such an addition\r\ntends to make the skin of a delicate hand somewhat hard and rough. If\r\nhard water must be used to wash with, the only harmless substance that\r\ncan be conveniently added to it is a little good powdered borax. This\r\nwill also cause it to exert a genial action on the skin. Oatmeal and\r\nwarm water used every night and morning as a wash will whiten and\r\nsoften the roughest and darkest hands.\r\n\r\n=Coarse, Red, Dark-Skinned Hands= may be whitened by the occasional use\r\nof a few grains of chloride of lime, with warm water, in the manner\r\nmentioned above.\r\n\r\n=Roughness of the Hands=, induced by exposure to cold and drying winds,\r\nmay, in general, be removed by the use of a little powdered pumice\r\nstone with the soap in washing them. The subsequent application,\r\nparticularly at night, of the above lotions, or of two or three drops\r\nof almond or olive oil, well rubbed in, will usually effect the object\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nThe hands may be preserved dry for delicate work by rubbing a little\r\nclub moss (lycopodium), in fine powder, over them. So repellent is\r\nthis substance of moisture, that if a small quantity of it be\r\nsprinkled on the surface of a basin of water, the hand, by a little\r\nadroitness, may be plunged to the bottom of the basin without becoming\r\nwet.\r\n\r\nExcessive moisture or perspiration of the hands without obvious cause\r\nis generally indicative of debility, or disordered stomach, and\r\nrequires corresponding treatment. Frequently washing the hands in\r\nmoderately cold water often proves a local remedy for the\r\ninconvenience. The addition of a few grains of alum, sal ammoniac, or\r\nsulphate of zinc, or of a teaspoonful of vinegar, to the water greatly\r\nincreases its efficacy. Extremely delicate and susceptible persons\r\ncannot always bear the excessive perspiration of their hands to be\r\nthus suddenly lessened, and therefore some discretion should be\r\nexercised by them in their attempts to check it.\r\n\r\n=The Finger Nails= require special attention if we desire to preserve\r\nthem in their highest condition of beauty and usefulness. To keep them\r\nclean, the nailbrush and soap and water should be used once or oftener\r\ndaily, as circumstances demand. Once a day at least, on wiping the\r\nhands after washing them, and whilst they are still soft from the\r\naction of the water, the free edge of the scarfskin, which, if not\r\nattended to, is apt to grow upward over the nails, should be gently\r\nloosened and pressed back in a neatly rounded form, by which the\r\noccurrence of cracks and sores about their roots (agnails, nail\r\nsprings, etc.) will be prevented, and a graceful, oval form, ending in\r\na crescentlike space of white, will be ensured. The skin, as a rule,\r\nshould never be cut, pared, picked or torn off, as is commonly done,\r\nand the less it is meddled with, otherwise than in the way just\r\nmentioned, the better. The ends or points of the nails should be pared\r\nonce every week or ten days, according to the rapidity of their\r\ngrowth, which somewhat varies with the season of the year and the\r\nhabit of the individual. This is best done with a sharp penknife or\r\nnail-knife. Scissors are less convenient for the purpose, and have the\r\ndisadvantage of straining and distorting the nails during the process.\r\n\r\nThe length and shape of the nails, both for beauty and use, should\r\nexactly correspond with the tips of the fingers. Nails extending\r\nbeyond the ends of the fingers are vulgar, clawlike, and inconvenient;\r\nwhilst if shorter, particularly much shorter than the fingers, they\r\nare unsightly and of little use, and cause the tips of the fingers to\r\nbecome thick and clumsy. Biting the nails should be avoided as a dirty\r\nand disagreeable habit, and one utterly destructive to their beauty,\r\nstrength, and usefulness.\r\n\r\nTo remove stains and discolorations of the nails, a little lemon juice\r\nor vinegar and water is the best application. Should this fail, a few\r\ngrains of salt of sorrel, oxalic acid, or chloride of lime, each\r\ndiluted with warm water, may be applied, care being taken to\r\nthoroughly rinse the hands in clean water, without soap, afterwards.\r\nOccasionally a little pumice stone, in impalpable powder, or powdered\r\ncuttlefish bone, putty powder (polisher's peroxide of tin), may be\r\nused along with water and a piece of wash-leather, flannel, or the\r\nnailbrush, for the same purpose. The frequent use of any of these\r\nsubstances is, however, injurious to the healthy growth, strength, and\r\npermanent beauty of the nails. The common practice of scraping the\r\nsurface of the nails cannot be too strongly censured, as it causes\r\nthem to become weak and distorted. Blows on the nails, and, indeed,\r\nviolence to them in any form, also distorts and marks them.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of Oriental nations commonly dye the nails; and amongst\r\nmany savage tribes the same practice is adopted, and is not confined\r\nto the gentler sex. Amongst Western Europeans, and Americans, white\r\nand regularly-formed nails are alone esteemed.\r\n\r\n=Chapped Hands= are common among persons with a languid circulation, who\r\nare continually \"dabbling\" in water during cold weather, and\r\nparticularly among those with a scrofulous taint, who, without the\r\nlast, expose their ungloved hands to bleak, cold winds. The best\r\npreventives, as well as remedies, are the use of warm gloves out of\r\ndoors, and the application, night and morning, of a little glycerine,\r\ndiluted with twice its weight of water, or a little cold cream,\r\nspermaceti cerate, salad oil, or any other simple unguent or oil,\r\nwhich should be well rubbed in, the superfluous portion being removed\r\nwith a towel. This treatment will not only preserve the hands from the\r\neffects of cold and damp, but also tend to render them soft and white.\r\nDeep chaps which have degenerated into sores should be kept constantly\r\ncovered with a piece of lint wetted with glycerine or spread with\r\nspermaceti ointment, the part being at the same time carefully\r\npreserved from dirt, cold, and wind. It is said that a once favorite\r\nactress, celebrated for the beauty of her hands, even when in the\r\n\"sere and yellow leaf,\" covered them nightly with the flare of a calf\r\nor lamb, with the fat attached, over which was drawn a glove or mitten\r\nof soft leather. The application of a little glycerine or fatty\r\nmatter, in the way just indicated, would have been equally effective.\r\n\r\n=Warts=, like chilblains, are too well known to require description.\r\nThey chiefly attack the hands, and particularly the fingers, but\r\nsometimes occur on other portions of the body. They may be removed by\r\nrubbing or moistening their extremities every day, or every other day,\r\nwith lunar caustic, nitric acid, concentrated acetic acid, or aromatic\r\nvinegar, care being taken not to wash the hands for some hours after.\r\nThe first is an extremely convenient and manageable substance, from\r\nnot being liable to drop or spread; but it produces a black stain,\r\nwhich remains till the cauterized surface peels off. The second\r\nproduces a yellow stain, in depth proportioned to the strength of the\r\nacid employed. This also wears off after the lapse of a few days. The\r\nothers scarcely discolor the skin.\r\n\r\n=To Cause the Skin to become Satin-smooth, and to Smell like a bunch of\r\nViolets.=--Any one using the following preparation will be noted for\r\nthe fair softness of her complexion and the delicate perfume which\r\nemanates from her person. For ladies who like perfume, and care for a\r\nsatin-smooth skin, the following is an invaluable toilet\r\npreparation:--\r\n\r\nHave your druggist mix for you one ounce tincture of orris, one ounce\r\ntincture of benzoin, ten drops oil of neroli, and ten drops oil of\r\nlemon. To use this perfume, add a tablespoonful of it to about a pint\r\nof warm water. It will turn as white as milk, and the real perfume\r\nwill be given off, whereas while in the bottle it has anything but a\r\npleasing odor. Now, after your bath, just take a soft cloth and go\r\nover yourself with this milk, dry thoroughly, and you will smell like\r\na bunch of violets. The perfume may be altered to suit you, or you may\r\nadd any handkerchief extract, but don't omit the benzoin, for that is\r\nwhat gives permanence to the perfume and softness and smoothness to\r\nthe skin.\r\n\r\n=To Cause Those Who have Lost the Bloom and Fairness of Early Youth to\r\nRegain Them.=--Many ladies who as young girls were fair with a lovely\r\nrosy bloom, lose these beauties very early in life; very many do this\r\nat twenty, or very little later, and become sallow and heavy-eyed,\r\nthus losing their principal charm. Now, this is very easily remedied.\r\nGo to your druggist and ask him for some iron pills and for some\r\nsimple purgative to take with them. Get from him directions for taking\r\nboth, and take strictly according to his directions. In a very short\r\ntime you will again be fair and rosy and your eyes bright and\r\nsparkling; in fact, you will seem to have renewed your youth, and,\r\nindeed, you will feel like another person, so light-hearted will you\r\nbecome, in addition to your return of beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE HAIR.\r\n\r\n=Its Estimation, Structure, Growth, Management, Etc.=--The hair is not\r\nonly invaluable as a protective covering of the head, but it gives a\r\nfinish and imparts unequalled grace to the features which it\r\nsurrounds. Sculptors and painters have bestowed on its representation\r\ntheir highest skill and care, and its description and praises have\r\nbeen sung in the sweetest lays by the poets of all ages. Whether in\r\nflowing ringlets, chaste and simple bands, or graceful braids\r\nartistically disposed, it is equally charming, and clothes with\r\nfascination even the simplest forms of beauty.\r\n\r\n    O wondrous, wondrous, is her hair!\r\n    A braided wealth of golden brown,\r\n    That drops on neck and temples bare.\r\n\r\nIf there is one point more than another on which the tastes of mankind\r\nappear to agree, it is that rich, luxuriant, flowing hair is not\r\nmerely beautiful in itself, but an important, nay, an essential,\r\nauxiliary to the highest development of the personal charms. Among all\r\nthe refined nations of antiquity, as in all time since, the care,\r\narrangement and decoration of the hair formed a prominent and\r\ngenerally leading portion of their toilet. The ancient Egyptians and\r\nAssyrians, and other Eastern nations, bestowed on it the most\r\nelaborate attention. The ancient Jews, like their modern descendants,\r\nwere noted for the luxuriance and richness of their hair and the care\r\nwhich they devoted to it. Glossy flowing black hair is represented to\r\nhave been the glory of the ancient Jewess, and in her person to have\r\nexhibited charms of the most imposing character; whilst the chasteness\r\nof its arrangement was only equalled by its almost magic beauty. Nor\r\nwas this luxuriance, and this attention to the hair, confined to the\r\ngentler sex, for among the pagan Orientals the hair and beards of the\r\nmales were not less sedulously attended to. Among the males of Judah\r\nand Israel, long flowing ringlets appear to have been regarded as\r\nhighly desirable and attractive. The reputed beauty and the prodigious\r\nlength and weight of the hair of Absalom, the son of David, as\r\nrecorded in the sacred text, would be sufficient to startle the most\r\nenthusiastic modern dandy that cultivates the crinal ornament of his\r\nperson. Solomon the Wise, another son of David, conceived the beauty\r\nof hair sufficiently dignified to express figuratively the graces of\r\nthe Church.\r\n\r\nThe hair, though devoid of sensibility and unsusceptible of expression\r\nunder the influence of the will and the ordinary mental feelings, like\r\nthe mobile portions of the face, and though it may be popularly\r\nregarded rather in the light of a parasitic growth than as an\r\nessential portion of the body, is capable of being affected by the\r\nstronger emotions and passions, and even of aiding their expression in\r\nthe features. Who is there that, at some period or other of his life,\r\nif only in childhood, in a moment of sudden terror or horror, has not\r\nexperienced the sensation popularly described as \"the hair standing on\r\nend?\" Or who is there that, at some time or other, has not witnessed\r\nthe partial erection of the hair in children or females under like\r\nviolent emotions, or seen the representation of it in sculptures or\r\npaintings? Those passions, so aptly styled by Gray the \"vultures of\r\nthe mind,\" frequently affect with wonderful rapidity the health of\r\nboth the body and the mind, which wreck the hair soon sympathizes with\r\nand shares. Instances are recorded in which violent grief in a few\r\nweeks has blanched the hair and anticipated the effects of age; and\r\nothers in which intense terror or horror has affected the same with\r\neven greater celerity, the change having occurred in a few days or\r\neven in a few hours.\r\n\r\nBesides daily attention to the hair, something else is necessary to\r\ninsure its cleanliness and beauty and the perfect health of the skin\r\nof the head from which it springs. For this purpose the head should\r\nbe occasionally well washed with soap and water, an abundance of water\r\nbeing used and great care being subsequently taken to thoroughly rinse\r\nout the whole of the soap with the water in which the head has been\r\nwashed. The water may be either tepid or cold, according to the\r\nfeelings or habit of the person; and if the head or hair be very\r\nscurfy or dirty, or hard water be used, a few grains of soda (not\r\npotash or pearlash) may be advantageously added to the water. This\r\nwill increase its detersive qualities. After the hair has been washed,\r\nwhich should be done quickly, though thoroughly, it should be freed as\r\nmuch as possible by pressure with the hands and then wiped with a\r\nsoft, thick towel, which should be done with care, to avoid entangling\r\nit. After laying it straight, first with the coarse end of the\r\ndressing comb and then with the finer portion, it may be finally\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary cases once every two or three weeks is often enough to\r\nwash the hair and head. The extreme length of ladies' hair will\r\nsometimes render the process of washing it very troublesome and\r\ninconvenient. In such cases the patient and assiduous use of a clean,\r\ngood hairbrush, followed by washing the partings and the crown of the\r\nhead with soap and water, may be substituted.\r\n\r\nThe occasional washing of the head is absolutely necessary to preserve\r\nthe health of the scalp and the luxuriance and beauty of the hair when\r\nmuch oil, pomatum or other greasy substance is used in dressing it.\r\n\r\nMedical writers have frequently pointed out the ill effects of the\r\nfree or excessive use of oily or greasy articles for the hair; but\r\ntheir warnings appear to be unheeded by the mass of mankind. Some\r\nobject to their use altogether. There are, however, exceptions to\r\nevery rule, and some of these exceptions are noticed elsewhere in this\r\nvolume. The ill effects referred to chiefly occur from their being\r\nused when not required, and in excess, and are aggravated by the\r\nneglect of thorough cleanliness.\r\n\r\nTo improve the growth and luxuriance of the hair, when languid or\r\ndefective, the only natural and perfectly safe method that can be\r\nadopted is to promote the healthy action of the scalp by increasing\r\nthe vigor of the circulation of the blood through its minute channels.\r\nFor this purpose nothing is so simple and effective as gentle\r\nexcitation of the skin by frequent continued friction with the\r\nhairbrush, which has the convenience of ease of application and\r\ninexpensiveness. The same object may be further promoted by the\r\napplication of any simple cosmetic wash or other preparation that\r\nwill gently excite or stimulate the skin or exercise a tonic action on\r\nit without clogging its pores. Strong rosemary water or rosemary tea,\r\nand a weak solution of the essential oil of either rosemary or garden\r\nthyme, are popular articles of this kind. They may be rendered more\r\nstimulating by the addition of a little ammonia or a little spirit, or\r\nboth of them. The skin of the head should be moistened with these on\r\neach occasion of dressing the hair, and their diffusion and action\r\npromoted by the use of a clean hairbrush. Aromatized water, to which a\r\nvery little tincture or vinegar of cantharides (preferably the former)\r\nhas been added, may also be used in the same way, and is in high\r\nrepute for the purpose. When the skin is pale, lax, and wrinkled,\r\nastringent washes may be used. Strong black tea is a convenient and\r\nexcellent application of this kind. When the skin and hair are dry,\r\nand the latter also stiff and untractable, a little glycerine is an\r\nappropriate addition to each of the preceding washes or lotions. The\r\noccasional use of a little bland oil, strongly scented with oil of\r\nrosemary or of origanum, or with both of them, or with oil of mace, or\r\nvery slightly tinctured with cantharides, is also generally very\r\nserviceable when there is poorness and dryness of the hair. When the\r\nhair is unnaturally greasy and lax (a defect that seldom occurs), the\r\nuse of the astringent washes just referred to, or of a little simple\r\noil slightly scented with the essential oil of bitter almonds, will\r\ntend to remove or lessen it.\r\n\r\nAll the articles named above promote the glossiness and waviness of\r\nthe hair, and are also among the simplest, safest, and best\r\napplications that can be employed when the hair is weak and begins to\r\nfall off.\r\n\r\nTo impart some degree of curliness or waviness to the hair when it is\r\nnaturally straight, and to render it more retentive of the curl\r\nimparted to it by papers or by other modes of dressing it, various\r\nmethods are often adopted and different cosmetics employed. The first\r\nobject appears to be promoted by keeping the hair for a time in a\r\nstate intermediate between perfect dryness and humidity, from which\r\ndifferent parts of its structure, being unequally affected in this\r\nrespect, will acquire different degrees of relaxation and rigidity,\r\nand thus have a tendency to assume a wavy or slightly curly form,\r\nprovided the hair be left loose enough to allow it. For this purpose\r\nnothing is better than washing the hair with soap and water, to which\r\na few grains of salt of tartar (carbonate of potash) have been added;\r\nor it may be slightly moistened with any of the hair washes mentioned\r\nin the last paragraph, in each half-pint of which a few grains of the\r\ncarbonate (say ten or twelve), or a teaspoonful of glycerine, has\r\nbeen dissolved. The moistened hair, after the application of the\r\nbrush, should be finally loosely adjusted as desired with the\r\ndressing-comb. The effect occurs as the hair dries. When oils are\r\npreferable to hair washes, those strongly scented with the oil of\r\nrosemary, to which a few drops of oil of thyme or origanum may be\r\nadded, appear to be the most useful.\r\n\r\nTo cause the hair to retain the position given to it in dressing it,\r\nvarious methods and cosmetics are commonly employed. When the\r\narrangement is a natural one and the hair healthy and tractable, the\r\nfree use of the hairbrush will usually be sufficient for the purpose.\r\nWhen this is insufficient, the application of a few drops of oil, or,\r\nbetter still, moistening the hair with a little simple water, will\r\neffect the object satisfactorily. In very elaborate and unnatural\r\nstyles of dressing the hair, and to cause it to remain in curl or to\r\nretain its position during dancing, or violent exercise, bandoline and\r\ncosmetique or hard pomatum are the articles commonly employed in\r\nfashionable life. Mild ale or porter has a similar effect, and is\r\noften substituted for the preceding expensive cosmetics. The frequent\r\nuse of any of these articles is objectionable, as they clog up the\r\npores of the skin and shield both it and the hair from the genial\r\naction of the atmosphere, which is essential to their healthy vigor.\r\nThey should, hence, be subsequently removed by carefully washing the\r\nhead with a little soap and tepid water. Their use may be tolerated in\r\ndressing for the ballroom, but on no other occasion. Simple water\r\nskillfully employed, as noticed elsewhere, is the best and safest\r\nmixture, and under ordinary circumstances is amply sufficient for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe practice of artificially changing the color of the hair, and\r\nparticularly of dyeing it, has descended to us from remote antiquity,\r\nand though not so common in Western Europe as formerly, is still far\r\nfrom infrequent at the present day. This might be inferred from the\r\nmultitude of nostrums for the purpose continually advertised in the\r\nnewspapers, and from the number of persons who announce themselves as\r\npracticing the art, even though the keen and experienced eye did not\r\nfrequently detect instances of it, as it now does, in the hair and\r\nbeards of those we see around us. The recent rage after light auburn\r\nor reddish hair in fashionable life has, unfortunately, greatly\r\nmultiplied these instances. The consideration of the subject, however,\r\nin its ethical relations does not come within the province of the\r\npresent work, and I shall confine myself to pointing out how the color\r\nof the hair may be changed in the safest and most satisfactory\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nTo change the color of the hair various methods and preparations are\r\nemployed. The principal of these are intended to darken it, but\r\nsometimes the contrary is aimed at. Whichever object is desired, it is\r\nnecessary that the article or preparation employed to carry it out be\r\nnot of a caustic or irritant nature, capable of injuriously affecting\r\nthe delicate skin to which it is applied, or that it may be liable to\r\ncome in contact with, as is the case with many of the nostrums vended\r\nfor the purpose. Some of the substances that necessarily enter into\r\nthe composition of hair strains and hair dyes, or that are used in\r\nconnection with them, possess these objectionable properties in a high\r\ndegree, and can, therefore, only be safely employed in a state of\r\nproper dilution and combination. If any doubt exists respecting such\r\nan article, it is a wise precaution to regard it with suspicion and to\r\ntest its qualities before applying it for the first time. This may be\r\ndone by placing some of it on the soft skin of the inner side of the\r\nwrist or fore-arm, and allowing it to remain there as long, and under\r\nthe same conditions, as it is ordered to be left in contact with the\r\nhair or skin of the head or face. In this way the injury or loss of\r\nthe hair, sores, and other serious consequences that too often follow\r\nthe use of advertised and ill-prepared hair dyes may be generally\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nTo gradually darken the shade of the hair on these principles,\r\nprovided its normal sulphur be still secreted by the hair-bulbs and be\r\nstill present in its structure, it will, therefore, generally be\r\nsufficient to occasionally employ a weak solution of any of the milder\r\nsalts of iron as a hair wash. The menstruum may be water, to which a\r\nlittle spirits and a few drops of oil of rosemary to increase its\r\nstimulating qualities have been added. In applying it, the head being\r\nfirst washed clean, care should be taken to thoroughly moisten the\r\nwhole surface of the hair and the skin of the head with the wash; and\r\nits absorption and action should be promoted by the free use of a\r\nclean hairbrush. Wine is the favorite solvent for the iron; ale and\r\nbeer are also sometimes so employed. Most of the fashionable\r\nferruginous hair washes also contain a few grains of acetate of copper\r\nor distilled verdigris, the objections to which have been already\r\npointed out.\r\n\r\nThe daily use of oil or pomatum, with which a few grains of carbonate\r\nof lead, lead plaster, or trisnitrate of bismuth, have been blended by\r\nheat and careful trituration, has generally a like effect on the hair\r\nto ferruginous solutions; so also has a leaden comb, but its action is\r\nvery uncertain. None of these last are, however, safe for\r\nlong-continued use. Atrophy of the scalp, baldness, and even local\r\nparalysis, have sometimes, though rarely, been caused by them.\r\n\r\nWhen the normal sulphur of the hair is absent, or deficient, the\r\npreceding substances fail to darken the hair. In this case the desired\r\neffect may often be produced by also moistening the head, say twice a\r\nweek, with water, to which a little sulphuret of potassium or\r\nhydrosulphuret of ammonia has been added.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to dye or darken the hair more rapidly, as in a few\r\nhours, or even a few minutes, plumbite of lime, plumbite of potassa,\r\nor nitrate or ammonia--nitrate of silver--is usually employed. The\r\nfirst is commonly produced by the admixture of quicklime with oxide of\r\nlead (litharge), carbonate of lead, or acetate of lead. These\r\ningredients should be in appropriate proportions, but very generally\r\nthe reverse is the case in those of the shops.\r\n\r\nIt may be laid down as a rule that when the lime is in greater\r\nproportion than about two to one of the oxide, and to the\r\ncorresponding equivalents of the other substances mentioned, or when\r\nthe lime has not been prepared in a proper manner, the compound is not\r\nsafe, and very likely to prove injurious to the skin and hair-bulbs,\r\nand perhaps to act as a depilatory. The effects of these lead dyes\r\narise partly in the way previously described and partly by direct\r\nchemical action between the sulphur of the hair and the lead which\r\nthey contain, sulphuret of lead being formed in the surfacial portion\r\nof the hair. It is on the last that their more immediate effect\r\ndepends. If there be no sulphur in the hair, they will not darken it.\r\nAfter the necessary period of contact, they should be gently but\r\nthoroughly removed from the hair and skin by rubbing them off with the\r\nfingers, and by the use of the hairbrush, the head being then washed\r\nclean with tepid water. Should the tint imparted by them not be deep\r\nenough, or be too fiery, it may be darkened and turned on the brown or\r\nblack by moistening the hair the next day with a very weak solution of\r\nsulphuret of potassium, or of hydrosulphuret of ammonia.\r\n\r\nNone of the compounds of lead stain the skin, an advantage which has\r\nled to a preference being given to them by many persons who are clumsy\r\nmanipulators, and to the more extensive use of them than of other hair\r\ndyes.\r\n\r\nThe salts of silver above referred to are more rapid in their action\r\nas hair dyes than those containing lead. It is only necessary to wash\r\nthe hair quite clean and free from grease, then to moisten it with a\r\nweak solution of one of them, and, lastly, to expose it to the light,\r\nto effect the object in view. Sunlight will fully darken it in a few\r\nminutes, but in diffused daylight it will take two or three hours, or\r\nlonger, to acquire the deepest shade. To avoid this delay and\r\ninconvenience, the common practice is, a few minutes after applying\r\nthe silver solution, to moisten or wet the hair with a solution of\r\nsulphuret of potassium, or of hydrosulphuret of ammonia. The effect is\r\nimmediate, and the full depth of shade which a silver solution of the\r\nstrength employed is capable of imparting is at once produced. A few\r\nminutes later and the hair and skin may be rinsed with tepid water,\r\ngently wiped dry, and the hair finally adjusted with the comb. The\r\neffect of its application, its rapid action, and the satisfactory\r\nnature of the effect produced, all tend to render a solution of\r\nnitrate of silver the favorite hair dye of those who have sufficient\r\nskill and steadiness of hand to use it properly.\r\n\r\nIt will be useful here to inform the inexperienced reader that all\r\nsolutions and compounds which contain nitrate of silver stain the skin\r\nas well as the hair, if they be allowed to touch it. These stains may\r\nbe removed, when quite recent, by rubbing them with a piece of rag or\r\nsponge wetted with a weak solution of potassium, of hydrosulphuret of\r\nammonia, or of iodide of potassium; but as this is attended with some\r\ntrouble and inconvenience, the best way is to avoid the necessity of\r\nhaving recourse to it. The hairdressers commonly adopt the plan of\r\nsmearing hard pomatum or cosmetique over the skin immediately\r\nsurrounding the hair to be operated upon, in order to protect it from\r\nthe dye. By very skillful manipulation, and the observance of due\r\nprecautions, the hair may be thoroughly moistened with the silver\r\nsolution without touching the adjacent skin; but this can only be done\r\nwhen the hair of the head is under treatment by a second party.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the tone and shades of color given by the substances\r\ncommonly employed to dye the hair, it may be useful to state that the\r\nshades given by preparations of _iron_ and _bismuth_ range from dark\r\nbrown to black; those given by the salts of silver, from a fine\r\nnatural chestnut to deep brown and black, all of which are rich and\r\nunexceptional. The shades given by lead vary from reddish-brown and\r\nauburn to black; and when pale or when the dye has been badly applied\r\nor compounded, are generally of a sandy, reddish hue, often far from\r\nagreeable. However, this tendency of the lead dyes has recently led to\r\ntheir extensive use to impart that peculiar tint to the light hair of\r\nladies and children which is now so fashionable. Other substances,\r\nhereafter referred to, are, however, preferable, as imparting a more\r\npleasing hue.\r\n\r\nThe reddish tint produced by lead, as already hinted, may be generally\r\ndarkened into a brown, more or less rich, by subsequently moistening\r\nthe hair with a weak solution of either sulphuret of potassium or\r\nhydrosulphuret of ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe favorite compounds for external use in baldness, and, perhaps, the\r\nmost convenient and best, are such as owe their stimulating quality to\r\ncantharides or Spanish flies, or to their active principle,\r\ncantharidine. This application of these drugs has received the\r\nsanction of the highest medical authorities, both in Europe and\r\nAmerica. The leading professional hair-restorers now rely almost\r\nexclusively on cantharides, and all the more celebrated advertised\r\nnostrums for restoring the hair contain it as their active ingredient.\r\n\r\nOils and pomades, very strongly impregnated with the essential oil of\r\ngarden thyme (origanum) and rosemary, and lotions or liniments\r\ncontaining ammonia with a like addition of these essential oils,\r\nprobably come next in the frequency of their use as popular\r\nrestoratives of the hair in actual and incipient baldness.\r\n\r\n=To Have Elegant Hair.=--Every girl should have thick, magnificent hair.\r\nIt is essential to clip the ends of the hair once a month after a\r\nchild is four years of age. Ammonia and warm water is an excellent\r\nwash for the hair and scalp, and gives life and vigor to it when all\r\nother articles fail.\r\n\r\n=Wild Rose Curling Fluid.=--Take two drams (avoirdupois) dry salt of\r\ntartar; (carbonate of potassa) powdered cochineal, half dram; liquor\r\nof ammonia and spirit de rose, each one fluid dram; glycerine,\r\none-fourth ounce; rectified spirit, one and one-half imperial fluid\r\nounces; distilled water, eighteen ounces; digest with agitation for a\r\nweek, and then decant or filter. The hair to be moistened with it, and\r\nthen loosely adjusted. The effect occurs as it dries.\r\n\r\n=To Cause the Hair to Grow very Thick.=--One of the most powerful\r\nstimulants for the growth of the hair is the following: Take a quarter\r\nof an ounce of the chippings of alkanet root, tie in a scrap of coarse\r\nmuslin, and suspend it in a jar containing eight ounces of sweet oil\r\nfor a week, covering it from the dust. Add to this sixty drops\r\ntincture of cantharides, ten drops oil of rose, sixty drops of neroli,\r\nand sixty drops oil of lemon. Let this stand twenty days, closely\r\ncorked, and you will have one of the greatest hair-invigorators and\r\nhair-growers that this world has ever produced.\r\n\r\n=Lola Montez Hair Coloring.=--This celebrated woman published the\r\nfollowing, and claimed that it was as harmless as any preparation that\r\nwould really color the hair: Ten grains of gallic acid, one ounce of\r\nacetic acid, one ounce of tincture of sesgurichloride of iron.\r\nDissolve the gallic acid, sesgurichloride, and add the acetic acid.\r\nWash the hair with soap and water; when dried, apply the dye by\r\ndipping a fine comb in it and drawing through the hair so as to color\r\nthe roots thoroughly. Let it dry, then oil and brush well.\r\n\r\n=Hair Restorative.=--Four drams oxide bismuth, four drams spermaceti,\r\nfour ounces pure hog's lard. The lard and spermaceti should be melted\r\ntogether. When nearly cool, stir in the bismuth and perfume. Prevents\r\nthe hair from turning gray, and restores gray hair.\r\n\r\n=For Bald Heads.=--A most valuable remedy for promoting the growth of\r\nthe hair is an application, once or twice a day, of wild indigo and\r\nalcohol. Take four ounces of wild indigo and steep it about a week or\r\nten days in a pint of alcohol and a pint of hot water, when it will be\r\nready for use. The head must be thoroughly washed with the liquid,\r\nmorning and evening, application being made with a sponge or soft\r\nbrush.\r\n\r\nAnother excellent preparation is composed of three ounces of castor\r\noil, with just enough alcohol to cut the oil, to which add twenty\r\ndrops tincture of cantharides, and perfume to suit. This not only\r\nsoftens and imparts a gloss to the hair, but also invigorates and\r\nstrengthens the roots of the hair.\r\n\r\n=Excellent Hair Wash.=--Take one ounce of borax, half an ounce of\r\ncamphor; powder these ingredients very fine and dissolve them in one\r\nquart boiling water. When cool the solution will be ready for use.\r\nDampen the hair frequently. This wash effectually cleanses,\r\nbeautifies, and strengthens the hair, preserves the color, and\r\nprevents early baldness. The camphor will form into lumps after being\r\ndissolved, but the water will be sufficiently impregnated.\r\n\r\n=To Cure Baldness.=--Cologne water, two ounces; tincture of cantharides,\r\ntwo drams; oil of lavender or rosemary, of each ten drops. These\r\napplications must be used twice a day for three or four weeks, but if\r\nthe scalp becomes sore they may be discontinued for a time or used at\r\nlonger intervals.\r\n\r\nWhen the hair falls off, from diminished action of the scalp,\r\npreparations of cantharides are excellent. The following will cause\r\nthe hair to grow faster than any other preparation: Beef marrow\r\n(soaked in several waters, melted and strained), half a pound;\r\ntincture cantharides (made by soaking for a week one dram of powdered\r\ncantharides in one ounce of proof spirit), one ounce; oil of bergamot,\r\ntwelve drops.\r\n\r\n=Stimulants for the Hair.=--Vinegar and water form a good wash for the\r\nroots of the hair. A solution of ammonia is often used with good\r\neffect for the same purpose. For removing scurf, glycerine diluted\r\nwith a little rose-water will be found of service. Any preparation of\r\nrosemary forms an agreeable and highly cleansing wash. The yolk of an\r\negg beaten up in warm water is a most nutritious application to the\r\nscalp. A very good application is made in this way: Take an ounce of\r\npowdered borax and a small piece of camphor and dissolve in a quart of\r\nboiling water. The hair must afterwards be washed in warm water. Many\r\nheads of hair require nothing more in the way of wash than soap and\r\nwater. The following recipe will strengthen the hair and prevent its\r\nfalling out: Vinegar of cantharides, half an ounce; eau de cologne,\r\none ounce; rose-water, one ounce. The scalp should be brushed briskly\r\nuntil it becomes red, and the lotion should then be applied to the\r\nroots of the hair twice a day.\r\n\r\n=The Golden Hair Secret.=--The rage for light, gold color, or even red\r\nhair, which has prevailed for some time, has led to various expedients\r\nfor procuring it. Many ladies have sacrificed fine heads of hair, and\r\nin place of their own dark tresses have adopted light wigs; but the\r\nprevailing absurdity has been the use of strong alkalies for the\r\npurpose of turning dark hair light. This is the purpose of the\r\nausicomus fluid, which may be procured of any hairdresser; but we warn\r\nour fair readers that the use of these products is apt to be\r\ndisappointing. They certainly will turn black to a brick-dust hue, but\r\nthe color is often disagreeable. It is apt to present itself in\r\npatches in different hues, and the effect on the hair is terrible--it\r\noften rots and crumbles away. In place of this absurd practice, we\r\nrecommend the following as available for trying the effect for dress\r\npurpose: Procure a packet of gold powder of the hairdresser. Have\r\nready a very weak solution of gum and water, and one of the small\r\nperfume vaporizers now in use. When the hair has been dressed,\r\nsprinkle it with gum and water by means of the vaporizer and then\r\nshower on the gold powder. It may be put on thick enough to hide the\r\ncolor of the hair, and owing to the gum it cannot be danced off. The\r\neffect by artificial light is beautiful.\r\n\r\n=For Keeping the Hair Crimped or Curled in Summer.=--A quarter of an\r\nounce of gum tragacanth, one pint rose-water, and five drops of\r\nglycerine; mix and let stand over night. If the tragacanth is not\r\ndissolved, let it remain half a day longer; if it is thick add more\r\nrose-water and let it remain for some hours. If then it is a smooth\r\nsolution, nearly as thin as glycerine, it is fit for use. Dampen the\r\nhair before crimping or curling.\r\n\r\n=To Bleach the Hair.=--It has been found in the bleaching of hair that\r\ngaseous chlorine is the most effectual. The hair should be cleaned for\r\nthat purpose by a warm solution of soda and washed afterwards with\r\nwater. While moist it is put into a jar with chlorine gas introduced\r\nuntil the air in the jar looks greenish. Allow it to remain on for\r\ntwenty-four hours, and then, if necessary, repeat the operation.\r\n\r\n=A New French Remedy for Baldness.=--Croton oil, one of the best French\r\nremedies for baldness, is employed by simply adding to it oil or\r\npomade, and stirring or agitating the two together until admixture or\r\nsolution is complete. The formula adopted by the eminent French\r\nphysician who introduced this remedy, and who speaks in the most\r\nconfident and enthusiastic way of the success attending its use, is:\r\nTake croton oil, twelve drops (minims); oil of almonds, four troy\r\ngrains. Mix. A little is to be well rubbed on the scalp twice a day.\r\nSoft down, we are assured, appears in three weeks.\r\n\r\n=For Improving the Hair.=--_Palma Christi oil for thickening the hair_:\r\nTake one ounce of Palma Christi oil, add oil of lavender or bergamot\r\nto scent it. Let it be well brushed into the hair for two or three\r\nmonths, particularly applying it to those parts where it may be most\r\ndesirable to render the hair luxuriant. This is a simple and valuable\r\noil, and not in the hands of any monopolist.\r\n\r\n=To Dye the Hair Flaxen.=--We have heard the following is effective:\r\nTake a quart of lye prepared from the ashes of vine twigs, briony,\r\ncelandine roots, and tumeric, of each half an ounce; saffron and lily\r\nroots, of each two drams; flowers of mullein, yellow stechas, broom,\r\nand St. John's wort, of each a dram. Boil these together and strain\r\noff the liquor clear. Frequently wash the hair with the fluid, and it\r\nwill change it, we are told, in a short time to a beautiful flaxen\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n=A Powder for Preserving the Hair.=--The following powder has the name\r\nof facilitating the regeneration of the hair and strengthening its\r\nroots. Still more valuable properties have been ascribed to it, such\r\nas that of rousing the imagination to vigorous efforts and\r\nstrengthening the memory--delightful properties if they could be\r\nrealized by such simple means. Take an ounce and a half of red roses;\r\na small quantity each of calamus aromaticus (sweet-scented flag), and\r\nof the long cyperus; an ounce of benzoin; six drams of aloes (the wood\r\nof); half an ounce of red coral, and the same quantity of amber; four\r\nounces of bean flour; and eight ounces of the root of Florentine iris.\r\nLet the whole be mixed together and reduced to a very fine powder, to\r\nwhich add a few grains of musk. This powder is to be sprinkled on the\r\nhair in the same manner as hair powder is generally used, and, having\r\nremained for a time embedded with the hair, to be removed by means of\r\ncomb and brush; and to be occasionally applied and removed. It is said\r\nto regenerate the hair and strengthen the roots, and to possess the\r\nproperties which are above enumerated.\r\n\r\n=To Make the Hair Grow and to Prevent It from Falling.=--The following\r\nrecipes are selected from a work published some years ago in Paris,\r\nentitled \"Manuel Cosmetique des Plantes\":--\r\n\r\nTake the roots of young vines, the roots of hemp, and young cabbages,\r\nof each two handfuls. Dry, and then burn them. Make afterwards a lye\r\nwith the ashes. Before the head is washed with this lye it must be\r\nrubbed with honey, and continue both for three successive days. This\r\nwill not only make the hair grow, but restore it upon bald places,\r\nunder certain habits and constitutions of body. Pulverize some parsley\r\nseed, and use it as hair powder for three nights at the commencement\r\nof the year, and it will prevent your hair from falling.\r\n\r\n=To Make the Hair Grow Quick.=--Dip, every morning, the teeth of your\r\ncomb in the juice of nettles, and comb the hair against the grain.\r\n\r\n=Mixture for Shampoo.=--Bay rum, one pint; tincture of cantharides, one\r\ndram; carbonate of ammonia, one half dram; salts tartar, one half\r\ndram. Mix.\r\n\r\n=To Prevent the Hair Falling Out.=--Boxwood shavings, six ounces; proof\r\nspirit, twelve ounces; spirits of rosemary, two ounces; spirits of\r\nnutmeg, one half ounce. Mix.\r\n\r\n=Wash for Scald Heads.=--Take one half ounce of sulphate of potassa, one\r\npint of lime water, one ounce of soap liniment. Mix, and apply to the\r\nhead two or three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        POWDERS AND THEIR USES.\r\n\r\nThe powders usually sold by druggists are injurious to the complexion,\r\nowing to harmful ingredients. If a powder is perfectly pure, a\r\nmoderate use of it will not harm the complexion, but if it is impure\r\nit soon causes the face to turn sallow and yellow. The following is\r\nperfectly pure, and is a splendid article, giving a lovely, refined\r\ncomplexion:--\r\n\r\n=Boston Burnet Powder for the Face.=--Five cents' worth of bay rum, five\r\ncents' worth of magnesia snowflake, five cents' worth of bergamot,\r\nfive cents' worth oil of lemon; mix in a pint bottle and fill up with\r\nrain water. Perfectly harmless, and splendid.\r\n\r\n=Queen Bess Complexion Wash.=--Put in a vial one dram of benzoin gum in\r\npowder, one dram nutmeg oil, six drops of orange-blossom tea or apple\r\nblossoms; put in half a pint of rain water, and boiled down to a\r\nspoonful, and strained; one-pint of sherry wine. Bathe the face\r\nmorning and night; it will remove all flesh-worms and freckles, and\r\ngive a beautiful complexion. Or, put one ounce of powdered gum benzoin\r\nin a pint of whisky. To use: Put in water in washbowl till it is\r\nmilky.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FLESH-WORMS--TO CURE.\r\n\r\nBlack specks on the nose disfigure the face. Remove by washing\r\nthoroughly in tepid water, rubbing with a towel, and applying with a\r\nsoft flannel a lotion made of three ounces of cologne and half an\r\nounce of liquor of potash.\r\n\r\n\r\n            TO WHITEN THE SKIN AND REMOVE FRECKLES AND TAN.\r\n\r\nBathe three times a day in a preparation of three quarts water, one\r\nquart alcohol, two ounces of cologne and one of borax, in proportion\r\nof two teaspoons mixture to two tablespoons soft water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                  TREATING OF MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Human Temperaments.=--By these are meant certain types, forms or\r\nconformations of the human body, each known and distinguished from the\r\nother by certain characteristics, which enable those who are familiar\r\nwith these peculiarities to readily distinguish one temperament from\r\nthe others. The existence of the temperaments is believed to depend\r\nupon the development of certain parts or systems in the body, and each\r\nis accompanied by different degrees of activity of the brain, and\r\ncorresponding difference in the talents and manifestations of the\r\nindividual. They are four in number, viz.: Nervous, Sanguine, Bilious,\r\nand Lymphatic. When the brain and nerves are predominant, it is termed\r\nthe _nervous_ temperament; if the lungs and blood vessels\r\nconstitutionally predominate, the _sanguine_; if the muscular and\r\nfibrous systems are in the ascendency, the _bilious_; and when the\r\nglands and assimilating organs are in the ascendency, it is termed the\r\n_lymphatic_ or _phlegmatic_.\r\n\r\nFirst: The nervous is indicated by fine, thin hair, small muscles,\r\nthin skin, pale countenance, brilliant eyes, with great quickness and\r\nsensitiveness to impressions, and is really the mental or intellectual\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\nSecond: The sanguine is known by a stout, well-defined form, a full\r\nface, florid complexion, moderate plumpness, firm flesh, chestnut or\r\nsandy hair, and blue eyes. This is the tough, hardy, working\r\ntemperament, excessively fond of exercise and activity, and a great\r\naversion to muscular quiescence and inactivity, and consequently\r\naverse to books and close literary pursuits.\r\n\r\nThird: The bilious is indicated by a thin, spare face, dark skin,\r\nblack hair, firm flesh, moderate stoutness, with rough, harsh, and\r\nstrongly marked features. This temperament gives great will,\r\nelasticity, and powers of endurance, and, when combined with the\r\nnervous, is the great, efficient, moving temperament in the great\r\nevents of the world.\r\n\r\nFourth: The lymphatic is indicated by paleness, roundness of the form,\r\nsoftness of muscle, fair hair, sleepy, half-closed eyes, and a dull,\r\nsluggish, inexpressive face. In this temperament the brain and all\r\nother parts of the body appear to be slow, dull, and languid, and the\r\nwhole body little else than one great manufactory of fat. These\r\ntemperaments, however, are rarely found pure, but mixed or blended in\r\nan almost endless variety of ways, producing the ever-varying\r\npeculiarities of human character and intellect.\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE FORTUNATE AND UNFORTUNATE DAYS OF EACH MONTH.\r\n\r\n                              FORTUNATE.\r\n\r\nIn January, six days--the 1st, 2nd, 15th, 26th, 27th, and 28th.\r\nIn February, four days--the 11th, 21st, 25th, and 26th.\r\nIn March, two days--the 10th and 24th.\r\nIn April, five days--the 6th, 15th, 16th, 20th, and 28th.\r\nIn May, three days--the 3rd, 18th, and 31st.\r\nIn June, five days--the 10th, 11th, 15th, 22nd, and 25th.\r\nIn July, three days--the 9th, 15th, and 28th.\r\nIn August, six days--the 6th, 7th, 10th, 11th, 19th, and 25th.\r\nIn September, five days--the 4th, 8th, 17th, 18th, and 23rd.\r\nIn October, five days--the 3rd, 7th, 16th, 21st, and 22nd.\r\nIn November, three days--the 5th, 14th, and 20th.\r\nIn December, six days--the 15th, 19th, 20th, 22nd, 23rd, and 25th.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             UNFORTUNATE.\r\n\r\nIn January, seven days--the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 13th, 14th, 20th, and 21st.\r\nIn February, seven days--the 3rd, 7th, 9th, 12th, 16th, 17th, and 23rd.\r\nIn March, eight days--the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 28th, and 29th.\r\nIn April, two days--the 24th and 25th.\r\nIn May, five days--the 17th, 20th, 27th, 29th, and 30th.\r\nIn June, eight days--the 1st, 5th, 6th, 9th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 24th.\r\nIn July, four days--the 3rd, 10th, 17th, and 18th.\r\nIn August, two days--the 15th and 16th.\r\nIn September, two days--the 9th and 16th.\r\nIn October, six days--the 4th, 9th, 11th, 17th, 27th, and 31st\r\nIn November, four days--the 3rd, 9th, 10th, and 21st.\r\nIn December, two days--the 14th and 21st.\r\n\r\n\r\n         DAYS OF THE WEEK--THEIR IMPORTANCE AT THE NATAL HOUR.\r\n\r\nA child born on Sunday shall be of long life and obtain riches.\r\n\r\nA child born on Monday will be weak and effeminate.\r\n\r\nTuesday is more unfortunate still, though a child born on this day\r\nmay, by extraordinary vigilance, conquer the inordinate desires to\r\nwhich he will be subject; still, in his violent attempts to gratify\r\nthem, he will be in danger of a violent death.\r\n\r\nThe child born on Wednesday will be given to a studious life, and\r\nshall reap great profit therefrom.\r\n\r\nA child born on Thursday shall attain great honor and dignity.\r\n\r\nHe who calls Friday his natal day shall be of a strong constitution,\r\nand perhaps addicted to the pleasures of love.\r\n\r\nSaturday is another ill-omened day; most children born on this day\r\nwill be of heavy, dull, and dogged disposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     IMPORTANT ADVICE TO FEMALES.\r\n\r\nIt has often been observed, and experience has shown the observation\r\nto be a true one, that some event of importance is sure to happen to a\r\nwoman in her thirty-first year, whether it prove for her good or it be\r\nsome evil or temptation; therefore we advise her to be circumspect in\r\nall her actions. If she is a maiden or widow, it is probable she will\r\nmarry this year. If a wife, that she will lose her children or\r\nhusband. She will either receive riches or travel into a foreign land;\r\nat all events, some circumstance or other will take place during this\r\nremarkable year of her life that will have great effect on her future\r\nfortunes and existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE MAGIC RING.\r\n\r\n=To know whom you will marry, and what kind of a fate you will have\r\nwith them.=--Borrow a wedding ring, concealing the purpose for which\r\nyou borrow it; but no widow's or pretended marriage ring will do--it\r\nspoils the charm; wear it for three hours at least before you retire\r\nto rest, and then suspend it, by a hair off your head, over your\r\npillow; write within a circle resembling a ring, the sentence from the\r\nmatrimonial service beginning with, \"_with this ring I thee wed_,\" and\r\nround the circle write your own name at full length, and the figures\r\nthat stand for your age; place it under your pillow, and your dream\r\nwill fully explain whom you are to marry, and what kind of a fate you\r\nwill have with them. If your dream is too confused to remember it, or\r\nyou do not dream at all, it is a certain sign that you will never be\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\n\r\n                PHYSIOGNOMICAL SIGNS OF A GOOD GENIUS.\r\n\r\nA straight, erect body, neither over tall nor short, between fat and\r\nthin. The flesh naturally soft. The skin neither soft nor rough, but a\r\nmedium between. The complexion white, verging to a blush of redness.\r\nThe hair between hard and soft, usually of a brown color. The head and\r\nface of a moderate size. The forehead rather high. The eyes manly,\r\nbig, and clear, of a blue or hazel color. The aspect mild and humane.\r\nThe teeth so mixed that some are broad and some narrow. A subtle\r\ntongue, and the voice between intense and remiss. The neck comely and\r\nsmooth. The channel-bone of the throat appearing and moving. The back\r\nand ribs not over fleshy. The shoulders plain and slender. The hands\r\nindifferently long and smooth. The fingers long, smooth, and equally\r\ndistant. The nails white, mixed with red, and shining. The carriage of\r\nthe body erect in walking.\r\n\r\n\r\n         ELECTRICAL PSYCHOLOGY, OR PSYCHOLOGICAL FASCINATION.\r\n\r\nThe most easy, sure and direct mode to produce electro-psychological\r\ncommunication is to take the individual by the hand, in the same\r\nmanner as though you were going to shake hands. Press your thumb with\r\nmoderate force upon the _ulnar nerve_, which spreads its branches to\r\nthe ring and little finger. The pressure should be nearly one inch\r\nabove the knuckle, and in range of the ring finger. Lay the ball of\r\nthe thumb flat and particularly crosswise so as to cover the minute\r\nbranches of this nerve of motion and sensation. When you first take\r\nyour subject by the hand, request him to place his eyes upon yours,\r\nand to keep them fixed, so that he may see every emotion of your mind\r\nexpressed in the countenance. Continue this pressure for half a minute\r\nor more, then request him to close his eyes, and with your fingers\r\ngently brush downward several times over the eyelids, as though\r\nfastening them firmly together. Throughout the whole process feel\r\nwithin yourself a fixed determination to close them, so as to express\r\nthat determination fully in your countenance and manner. Having done\r\nthis, place your hand on the top of his head and press your thumb\r\nfirmly on the organ of individuality, bearing partially downward, and\r\nwith the other thumb still pressing the _ulnar nerve_, tell him, _You\r\ncannot open your eyes!_ Remember that your manner, your expression of\r\ncountenance, your motions, and your language must all be of the same\r\npositive character. If he succeed in opening his eyes, try it once or\r\ntwice more, because impressions, whether physical or mental, continue\r\nto deepen by repetition. In case, however, that you cannot close his\r\neyes, nor see any effect produced upon them, you should cease making\r\nany further efforts, because you have now fairly tested that his mind\r\nand body both stand in a positive relation as regards the doctrine of\r\nimpressions. If you succeed in closing the subject's eyes by the above\r\nmode, you may then request him to put his hands on his head, or in any\r\nother position you choose, and tell him, _You cannot stir them!_ In\r\ncase you succeed, request him to be seated, and tell him, _You cannot\r\nrise!_ If you are successful in this, request him to put his hands in\r\nmotion, and tell him, _You cannot stop them!_ If you succeed, request\r\nhim to walk on the floor, and tell him, _You cannot cease walking!_ As\r\nso you may continue to perform experiments, involving muscular motion\r\nand paralysis of any kind that may recur to your mind, till you can\r\ncompletely control him in arresting or moving all the voluntary parts\r\nof his system.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MESMERISM.\r\n\r\nIf you desire to mesmerize a person, who has never been put in that\r\nstate, nor in the least affected, the plan is to set him in an easy\r\nposture and request him to be calm and resigned. Take him by both\r\nhands, or else by one hand and place your other gently on his\r\nforehead. But with whatever part of his body you choose to come in\r\ncontact, be sure to always touch two points, answering to the\r\n_positive_ and _negative_ forces. Having taken him by both hands, fix\r\nyour eyes upon his, and, if possible, let him contentedly and steadily\r\nlook you in the face. Remain in this position until his eyes close.\r\nThen place both your hands on his head, gently pass them to his\r\nshoulders, down the arms, and off at the ends of his fingers. Throw\r\nyour hands outward as you return them to his head, and continue these\r\npasses till he can hear no voice but yours. He is then entirely in the\r\nmesmeric state. When a person is in the mesmeric state, whether put\r\nthere by yourself or someone else, you can awake him by the upward\r\npasses, or else do it by an impression, as follows: Tell him, \"I will\r\ncount _three_, and at the same instant I say _three_ I will slap my\r\nhands together, and you will be wide awake and in your perfect senses.\r\nAre you ready?\" If he answers in the affirmative, you will proceed to\r\ncount \"One, two, three!\" The word three should be spoken suddenly, and\r\nin a very loud voice, and at the same instant the palms of the hands\r\nshould be smitten together. This will instantly awake him.\r\n\r\n\r\n            HOW TO MAKE PERSONS AT A DISTANCE THINK OF YOU.\r\n\r\nLet it be particularly remembered that \"faith\" and concentration of\r\nthought are positively needful to accomplish aught in drawing others\r\nto you, or making them think of you. If you have not the capacity or\r\nunderstanding to operate an electric telegraph battery, it is no proof\r\nthat an expert and competent person should fail in doing so. Just so\r\nin this case; if faith, meditation, or concentration of thought fail\r\nyou, then will you also fail to operate on others. First, you must\r\nhave a yearning for the person you wish to make think of you; and,\r\nsecondly, you must learn to guess at what time of day or night, he may\r\nbe unemployed--passive--so that he may be in a proper state to receive\r\nthe thought which you dispatch to him. If he should be occupied in any\r\nway, so that his nervous forces were needed to complete his task, his\r\n\"human battery,\" or thought, would not be in a recipient or passive\r\ncondition, therefore your experiment would fail at that moment. Or, if\r\nhe were under heavy narcotics, liquors, tobacco, or gluttonous\r\ninfluences, he could not be reached at such moments. Or, if he were\r\nasleep, and you operated to effect a wakeful mind or thought, you\r\nwould fail again at the moment. To make a person at a distance think\r\nof you (whether you are acquainted with him or not, matters not), I\r\nagain repeat, find out or guess at what moment he is likely to be\r\npassive--by this I mean easy and careless; then, with the most fervent\r\nprayer or yearning of your entire heart, mind, soul, and strength,\r\ndesire he may think of you. And if you wish him to think on any\r\nparticular topic in relation to you, it is necessary for you to press\r\nyour hands, when operating on him, on such mental faculties of your\r\nhead as you wish him to exercise towards you. This demands a meager\r\nknowledge of Phrenology. His \"feeling nature,\" or \"propensities,\" you\r\ncannot reach through these operations, but when he thinks of you (if\r\nhe does not know you, he imagines such a being as you are) he can\r\neasily afterwards be controlled by you, and he will feel disposed to\r\ngo in the direction where you are, if circumstances permit and he is\r\nhis own master, for, remember, circumstances alter cases. I said you\r\ncannot reach his \"feeling,\" but only his \"thinking,\" nature, truly,\r\nbut after he thinks of you once his \"feeling nature,\" or propensities,\r\nmay become aroused through his own organization. In conclusion on this\r\ntopic, let me say that if you wish the person simply to think of you,\r\none operation may answer; but, on the contrary, if you wish him to\r\nmeet you, or go where you are, all you have to do is to persevere, in\r\na lawful and Christian manner, to operate, and I assure you, in the\r\ncourse of all natural things--that is, if no accident or very\r\nunfavorable circumstances occur--he will make his way towards you, and\r\nwhen he comes within sight, or reaching distance of you, it will be\r\neasy to manage him.\r\n\r\n\r\n              HOW TO CHARM THOSE WHOM YOU MEET AND LOVE.\r\n\r\nWhen you desire to make any one \"love\" you with whom you meet,\r\nalthough not personally acquainted with him, you can very readily\r\nreach him and make his acquaintance, if you observe the foregoing\r\ninstructions in addition to the following directions: Suppose you see\r\nhim coming towards you, in an unoccupied mood, or recklessly or\r\npassively walking past you, all that remains for you at that moment is\r\nto concentrate your thought, and send it into him as before explained,\r\nand, to your astonishment, if he was passive, he will look at you, and\r\nnow is your time to send a thrill to his heart, by looking him\r\ncarelessly, though determinately, in the eyes, and praying him, with\r\nall your heart, mind, soul, and strength, that he may read your\r\nthought and receive your true love, which God designs we should bear\r\none another. This accomplished, and you need not, and must not, wait\r\nfor a cold-hearted, fashionable, and popular Christian introduction;\r\nneither should you hastily run into his arms, but continue operating\r\nin this psychological manner, not losing any convenient opportunity to\r\nmeet him at an appropriate place, when an unembarrassed exchange of\r\nwords will open the door to the one so magnetized. At this interview,\r\nunless prudence sanction it, do not shake hands, but let your manners\r\nand loving eyes speak with Christian charity and ease. Wherever or\r\nwhenever you meet again, at the first opportunity grasp his hand in an\r\nearnest, sincere, and affectionate manner, observing at the same time\r\nthe following important directions, viz.: As you take his bare hand in\r\nyours, press your thumb gently, though firmly, between the bones of\r\nthe thumb and the forefinger of his hand, and at the very instant when\r\nyou press thus on the blood vessels (which you can before ascertain to\r\npulsate) look him earnestly and lovingly in the eyes, and send all\r\nyour heart's, mind's, and soul's strength into his organization, and\r\nhe will be your friend, and if you find him not to be congenial, you\r\nhave him in your power, and by carefully guarding against evil\r\ninfluences, you can reform him to suit your own purified, Christian,\r\nand loving taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                  A SPECIAL CHAPTER FOR YOUNG WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nAdvice upon this subject is very much needed. I am assured that it is\r\na subject not often talked of in families--at least, as it ought to\r\nbe--nor is it much alluded to in the pulpit, and the result is that\r\nyoung people commonly get their notions about it from those only a\r\nlittle older than themselves, and who therefore know but little more\r\nthan they do, or from those who form their opinions from the abuse\r\nthey see of it and so hold degrading and unworthy ideas respecting it.\r\nSometimes all that is known about it amounts to this, that it is a\r\ndelightful thing to be married.\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that it often is, and always ought to be, delightful;\r\nstill, you know it is frequently the reverse. You cannot, then, be too\r\ncautious in the matter.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more orderly, right, proper, and holy than marriage. It\r\nis not, however, quite so simple an affair as you may fancy. Every\r\ngood thing (and this is one of the best) requires some effort to\r\nobtain it, and unless you take the right course you must not expect to\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nYou may often see a young woman who, from not entertaining correct\r\nviews on the point, is certainly taking a wrong course, her endeavors\r\nbeing rather to make what she considers a good match than by acquiring\r\nkind and orderly habits to qualify herself to become worthy of a\r\nworthy husband.\r\n\r\nThat the best things are liable to the greatest abuses is notorious,\r\nand from the lamentable fact that marriage is often abused we may\r\nfairly infer its pre-eminent worth. In truth, there is nothing more\r\nvaluable. It is, then, highly injurious to entertain low notions\r\nrespecting it, and men who indulge in loose conversation on the\r\nsubject are likely at the same time to think meanly of women. Beware\r\nof them, and if you hear them expressing such opinions in your\r\npresence, withdraw from them at once as unworthy of your company.\r\nNever fear but they will respect you the more for the rebuke.\r\n\r\nOf course you are looking forward to settling happily, and will do\r\nyour best for that purpose. On this let me remark that all happiness\r\n(that is, all that is genuine, and therefore worthy of the name) comes\r\nfrom connection with the one great source of all good, and He has\r\nfreely and fully provided all the means necessary for our being happy,\r\nboth here and hereafter. He has placed each of us where it is best for\r\nus to be, and in the circumstances that are best for us at the time,\r\nand this applies to you and to me now. Howsoever much appearances may\r\nbe to the contrary, He cares as much for each of us as if we were the\r\nsole objects of His care. It is only by doing our duty in humble\r\ndependence on His assistance, which He never withholds, that we can be\r\nhappy. It behooves you, then, to consider well what is your duty, in\r\norder that you may do it and may enjoy the blessings He is so ready to\r\nbestow. I hope you may have been a loving and dutiful daughter, an\r\naffectionate sister, and a faithful friend; then you may have good\r\nground of hope for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      WHEN A PROSPECT OF MARRIAGE\r\n\r\noccurs you cannot do better than consult your mother, aunt, or other\r\ndiscreet relative that has your welfare at heart, from whom you may\r\nreasonably expect the best and most disinterested advice; and this it\r\nwill be well for you to be guided by. Women of mature years can judge\r\nfar better than you whether a man is likely to make a good husband.\r\nYou should likewise quietly and cautiously make your own observations\r\namong your married acquaintances, especially where you believe there\r\nis a comfortable and happy home. You will doubtless find that to a\r\nvery great extent this happy home depends on the wife's management and\r\neconomy. Very often it happens that when two husbands have the same\r\nincome, with the same number of children, there will be comfort in the\r\none home and discomfort in the other. Now, there must be a reason for\r\nthis, and you should endeavor to find it out and profit by the lesson.\r\nIt is said \"Cleanliness is next to godliness,\" and truly the value of\r\ncleanliness cannot be overrated. In point of time, it should go before\r\ngodliness, for where there is not cleanliness there can hardly be\r\ngodliness; and the health of body and mind are greatly dependent on\r\nthese two. Moreover, where can there be complete happiness without\r\nhealth?\r\n\r\nOne of the most prolific sources of matrimonial difficulties is the\r\nlack of knowledge on the part of wives of the duties of housekeeping.\r\nIn these days there are a hundred young ladies who can drum on the\r\npiano to one who can make a good loaf of bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         YET A HUNGRY HUSBAND\r\n\r\ncares more for a good dinner than he does--as long as his appetite is\r\nunappeased--to listen to the music of the spheres. Heavy bread has\r\nmade many heavy hearts, given rise to dyspepsia--horrid dyspepsia--and\r\nits herd of accompanying torments. Girls who desire that their\r\nhusbands should be amiable and kind, should learn how to make good\r\nbread. When a young man is courting, he can live well at home; or, if\r\nhe has to go a distance to pay his addresses, he usually obtains good\r\nmeals at an hotel or an eating-house; but when he is married and gets\r\nto housekeeping, his wife assumes the functions of his mother or his\r\nlandlord, and it is fortunate for her if she has been educated so as\r\nto know what a good table is. Those who are entirely dependent upon\r\nhired cooks make a very poor show at housekeeping. The stomach\r\nperforms a very important part in the economy of humanity, and wives\r\nwho are forgetful of this fact commit a serious mistake.\r\n\r\nYou know full well that most young men--and most young women, too--are\r\ndesirous of marrying and having a family; but they do not sufficiently\r\nconsider that it is God who gives them this desire, and that for the\r\nwisest of purposes; not only that this world may be peopled, but also\r\nthat its inhabitants may be prepared for heaven.\r\n\r\nNothing is more certain than that\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MARRIAGE AFFORDS\r\n\r\nthe fairest opportunities for preparing for a better world. In it we\r\nhave others dearer than ourselves to think about and provide for; and\r\nin doing so, we have often to practice that very useful virtue,\r\nself-denial. Let me here impress upon you most deeply, that it is only\r\nby making others happy that we can become happy ourselves. The angels,\r\nwe may be assured, are happy, because they are always actively good;\r\nand for a similar reason it is that God himself is infinitely happy.\r\nIf you try to secure you own happiness by any other means than a\r\nfaithful discharge of your duty to God and your neighbor, you will\r\ncertainly fail.\r\n\r\nI dare say you will find that\r\n\r\n\r\n                  YOUNG MEN ARE FOND OF YOUR COMPANY,\r\n\r\nand of paying you every polite attention, and you, as a right-minded\r\nwoman, are well pleased to be so treated. It is due to you _as a\r\nwoman_. Now, each of them is, or ought to be, looking out for a wife,\r\nand it is well that you should know this. It is, too, more important\r\nthan you perhaps are aware, that you should be carefully making your\r\nown observations, so that when the time arrives for one of them to ask\r\nyou to become his wife you may not be taken by surprise, but may know\r\nhow to act on the occasion.\r\n\r\nLet me caution you here against a failing that is common among young\r\nwomen. I mean that of making themselves too cheap. They feel flattered\r\nby the attentions paid to them, and are not sufficiently aware that\r\nmany young men are fond of indulging in flattery; and such, if they\r\nfind a young woman weak enough to be pleased with it, will perhaps\r\nplay upon her feelings and gain her affections without having any\r\nhonorable intentions towards her.\r\n\r\nAs a protection against such, I recommend you to have a proper respect\r\nfor yourself, and to consider with what object or purpose you receive\r\ntheir attentions. If you respond without an object, you may be doing\r\nthem wrong; if you accept them when they have no right intentions, you\r\nallow them to wrong you. For this purpose consider well what you\r\nare--a human being intended for an eternity of bliss. God has made you\r\na woman; and, believe me, as there is no fairer, so there is no nobler\r\ncreature than woman. She is formed to be her husband's helpmate and\r\nthe mother of his children, and the all-important work of training\r\nthese for heaven depends mainly upon her. Great, then, is her\r\nresponsibility; but God has given her the requisite love and power to\r\ndo her duty with satisfaction and delight. He has placed you in this\r\nbeautiful world that by doing your duty as a daughter, sister, wife,\r\nmother, and friend, you may become fitted to enter His heavenly\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nDuring your courtship let me entreat you to be very careful and\r\ncircumspect. There is no period of life that can compare with this\r\ndelightful season. It is, or should be, full of sunshine and sparkling\r\nwith the poetry of life; but alas! to many it is the opposite. A want\r\nof judgment--a momentary indiscretion--has not only blotted out this\r\nbeautiful springtime of life, but has marred, darkened, and blighted\r\nthe whole of the after lifetime.\r\n\r\nNo maiden can, under any circumstances, place her character in the\r\nhands of any man before marriage. No matter how sincere the love, how\r\nardent the protestations, how earnest or plausible the pleadings, you\r\nmust not, you cannot, surrender your honor. You must preserve your\r\nprudence and virtue; it is only by possession of these that you can\r\nkeep\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE LOVE AND RESPECT OF YOUR LOVER.\r\n\r\nBe firm, be circumspect; a rash word or a false step may extinguish\r\nforever all your bright hopes and prospective joys. Even should your\r\nlover redeem his promises and take you to be his wife, this\r\nindiscretion, or crime, will surely hang over you like a curse,\r\ncreating discord, trouble, and sorrow, the greatest portion of which\r\nwill fall to your share.\r\n\r\nYou must know that young men, however amiable, worthy or honorable\r\nthey may be, may, in a moment of intense excitement, commit a sin that\r\nin their calmer moments they would not be guilty of for worlds.\r\n\r\nBut under all circumstances you will be looked upon to resist any\r\nadvances, and maintain your purity and virtue. No matter how high the\r\ntide of passion may run in unguarded moments, and set in against\r\nheaven and against society, the terrible and painful ebb will surely\r\nfollow and leave you stranded forever on the bleak and barren shore of\r\nyour earthly existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THERE IS NO STATE OF LIFE MORE HONORABLE,\r\n\r\nuseful, and happy than that of a wife and mother. There must and ever\r\nwill be inequalities of station, but happiness is equally attainable\r\nin them all. To be happy, however, you must be good. Of course, I do\r\nnot mean absolutely good, for \"there is none good but One\"; but I mean\r\nthat you should be relatively good, and should aim at becoming better\r\nand more innocent as you advance in life. Now, you cannot respect\r\nyourself unless you know that you are worthy of respect; and if you do\r\nnot respect yourself, you cannot expect that anybody else will; and in\r\nsuch case you will not be worthy of the love of any good man, and none\r\nsuch will be likely to pay court to you. If, however, you take the\r\nright means, in which I include prayer for divine guidance, you will\r\nhave the respect and friendship of all your acquaintances, and then in\r\nGod's own time, and, let me add, without your seeking it, the man whom\r\nyou can make happy will present himself and propose to make you his\r\nwife, if it be God's will that you should become one.\r\n\r\nHere are two very important points for your consideration: First, that\r\nit should be your constant endeavor to\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MAKE YOUR HUSBAND HAPPY;\r\n\r\nand, second, that before you consent to marry him, you should\r\nascertain that he has those qualifications that will secure your\r\nhappiness. It most nearly concerns yourself that you do your duty to\r\nGod and your neighbor at all times, so that it becomes your habit; and\r\nyou will find it much easier, and safer, too, to do it every day\r\nrather than on only particular occasions; for this would require a\r\nspecial effort, and for the time, perhaps, put you into a state of\r\nexcitement, which, in all probability, would be followed by a\r\ndepression of spirits. What you should rather aim at is a uniformly\r\ncheerful state of mind, resulting from a conscious and confident\r\ndependence on Providence. If your husband knows from experience that\r\nsuch is your character, he cannot fail, provided he be worthy of you,\r\nto be content and happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    IT IS THE NATURE OF YOUNG WOMEN\r\n\r\nto be affectionate, and it is pleasant and usual for them to have\r\nseveral dear friends, enjoying more or less of their confidence. Among\r\nthese may be included some of their male acquaintance. Now, while they\r\nmay esteem each of these as they would a dear cousin, they should know\r\nand act upon the knowledge that it is only to _one_ they can give\r\ntheir unlimited confidence and individual affection as a wife. It is\r\nthe height of cruelty and wickedness for either a man or a woman to\r\ntrifle with another's affection. Such base conduct has cost many a\r\nyoung woman her health and peace, and even her life, and cannot,\r\ntherefore, be too much depreciated and avoided.\r\n\r\nLet me, then, advise you to be\r\n\r\n\r\n                             VERY CAUTIOUS\r\n\r\nbefore you allow a young man to pay you such marked attentions as may\r\nlead to marriage. It is not, you know, to terminate in seven years,\r\nlike an apprenticeship or a commercial partnership, but it is an\r\nengagement for the life of one of the parties. I want you, then, to\r\nprofit by the experience of others, too many of whom enter into\r\nmarriage from light and low considerations, and not to settle in life\r\ntill you, and also your friends, see that there is a reasonable\r\nprospect of your securing happiness, as well as comfort and a\r\nrespectable position.\r\n\r\nWhen a young woman has property or expects it, or is possessed of\r\nsuperior personal attractions, she should be especially prudent in her\r\nconduct towards the numerous admirers which such qualifications\r\nusually attract. No woman should allow herself to accept the\r\nattentions of any man who does not possess those sterling qualities\r\nwhich will command her respect, or whose love is directed to her\r\nfortune or beauty rather than herself. On such a one she can place no\r\nreliance, for should illness or misfortune overtake her she may find\r\nherself deprived of that love which she had valued as the great\r\ntreasure of her life. Possessed of this, she feels that earthly riches\r\nare but of secondary importance, and that the want of them can never\r\nmake her poor.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a worthier man than any of her interested suitors may have a\r\nsincere respect and affection for her, but be kept in the background\r\nby the overzealous attention of his rivals. Still, if she has\r\nsufficient self-command to patiently and calmly investigate their\r\ngeneral private character, she may find reason to decline their suit,\r\nand may discover that the more modest and retiring youth is the one\r\nthat is deserving of her love.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject, let me caution you against the foolish\r\naffectation which some girls practice in order to attract the\r\nattention of young men. In their company be natural in your manners,\r\nopen and friendly and ready to converse on general subjects; not\r\nappearing to expect that every one who pays you the ordinary\r\ncourtesies of society is going to fall in love with you. This mode of\r\nbehavior, which is more common with those who are vain of their beauty\r\nthan with others, frequently leads to such young women being more\r\nneglected than their less pretending sisters; for prudent young men,\r\nwho are impressed with the necessity of a right decision in the\r\nall-important step of marriage, instinctively shrink from those who\r\nseem unwilling to give them a fair opportunity of judging whether\r\ntheir hearts and minds are as attractive as their persons.\r\n\r\nYou may innocently admire many a young man for the noble qualities God\r\nhas bestowed upon him, without at all entertaining the idea either\r\nthat he would make you happy as his wife, or you him as your husband.\r\nThank God we are constituted of such different temperaments that all\r\nmay find suitable partners without clashing with each other's tastes,\r\nif they will only be content to watch and wait.\r\n\r\nIt is the part of a young man to _watch_, to be actively desirous of\r\nmeeting with a suitable partner. In doing this, his first\r\nconsideration should be to seek for such a one as he can make happy;\r\nnot to look primarily for beauty, fortune, wit, or accomplishments--things\r\nall very good in themselves, but by no means constituting the\r\nessentials of happiness. If he is influenced by pure and simple\r\nmotives, he will not find, or expect to find, more than one that can\r\nsatisfy his desire, and he will not be in much danger of exciting the\r\nenvy or the rivalry of his companions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is becoming in a young woman to\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WAIT PATIENTLY\r\n\r\ntill, from the assiduous and respectful attentions of a young man, she\r\ncan have no doubt that he is in earnest, when, and not before, she may\r\nfreely give him her company, and with every expectation of a happy\r\nresult. Be assured that no sensible young man is ever attracted by a\r\nyoung woman whom he sees on the lookout for a lover; he is more likely\r\nto think meanly of her, and to avoid her society.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, happen that a young man makes the offer before the\r\nyoung woman knows enough of him for it to be right for her to accept\r\nit, and before he, on his part, ought to take the step. In such case\r\nit would be well for her, even supposing she is inclined to like him,\r\nto tell him that he has taken her by surprise, and that she cannot\r\nthink of entering on so important a subject without consulting her\r\nfriends, to whom she accordingly refers him. It would then become her\r\nduty to intimate to him that, although his attentions are agreeable to\r\nthem, he must wait a while, till, from further acquaintance, they are\r\nenabled to judge whether it will conduce to the mutual happiness of\r\ntheir daughter and himself for her to accept the offer he has so\r\nkindly made.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only young men who\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ARE APT TO BE HASTY\r\n\r\nin these matters. It is, as is well known, not uncommon for parents,\r\nespecially mothers, very soon after a young man has begun to pay\r\nattention to their daughter, to give him to understand that they wish\r\nto know his intentions in reference to her. By such proceedings a\r\nyoung man may be taken aback, and either hurry into a match, which\r\nturns out unhappily, or be led to withdraw from a union which might\r\nhave resulted in the happiness of all the parties concerned.\r\n\r\nThat your parents should wish you to be married is only natural,\r\nespecially if their own marriage has been a happy one. It will be\r\ngratifying to them to see a worthy young man paying attention to you,\r\nand most probably they will let things take their own course. Marriage\r\nis too important a matter to admit of being hastened.\r\n\r\nThere are, I am aware, unwise parents, who, from various motives, will\r\nthrow obstacles in the way of young people who are desirous of coming\r\ntogether. Some are so selfish as to be unwilling to part with their\r\ndaughter, preferring their own happiness to hers. Others are so silly\r\nas to think no ordinary man good enough for her, and therefore, if\r\nthey had their own way, would have her to become an old maid.\r\nFortunately, such shortsighted people are not infrequently outwitted.\r\n\r\nIf your parents are, as I hope they are, reasonable in their views and\r\nexpectations, one of the chief concerns of their life will be the\r\npromotion of your happiness, and it behooves you to pay the utmost\r\ndeference to their opinion; and should they, from circumstances they\r\nbecome aware of, deem it advisable that you should either postpone or\r\neven break off an engagement, they will doubtless give you such\r\nweighty reasons as will justify you in acting on their advice. Where,\r\nhowever, as sometimes happens, they unwisely refuse their consent to\r\ntheir child's marriage at a time when she well knows from her own\r\nfeelings, and also from the sanction she receives from the opinion of\r\ntrustworthy and judicious friends, that she would be making a real\r\nsacrifice were she to comply with their wishes; if, I say, under such\r\ncircumstances she acts disobediently and marries the man she loves,\r\nmore blame attaches to the parents than to herself, and the sooner\r\nthey forgive her the better.\r\n\r\nIt is very common for young men, when going into the company of young\r\nwoman, together with their best dress to put on their best behavior;\r\nin fact, to assume a character which is not their natural one, but far\r\nsuperior to it.\r\n\r\nSome hold the opinion that\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \"ALL IS FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR.\"\r\n\r\nTo me it appears there cannot be greater folly and wickedness than for\r\nyoung people who are thinking of marrying to attempt to deceive each\r\nother. What is the good of it? A very short period of married life\r\nwill entirely dispel the illusion. I suppose people of the world may\r\nthink it fair to overreach one another in their dealings, saying\r\n\"everyone for himself.\" They have no intention of seeking to promote\r\nthe other's happiness; present gain is all they want. But a married\r\npair, to be happy, must\r\n\r\n\r\n                 RESPECT AND ESTEEM, AS WELL AS LOVE,\r\n\r\neach other; and this cannot be attained except by the constant\r\nendeavor to _be_ as well as to _appear_ true and good.\r\n\r\nThat young men should behave well in the presence of women is only\r\nnatural and right; none but a fool would do otherwise. But you, long\r\nbefore thinking of marrying, should take all fair means to learn what\r\nis the general conduct and habits of your male acquaintance in their\r\nfamily circle and with their daily connections. \"Are they good-humored\r\nand kind--able to bear the troubles they meet with? Are they\r\nindustrious, frugal, temperate, religious, chaste? Have they had the\r\nprudence to insure against sickness and death?\" Or, on the other hand,\r\nare they addicted to drinking, smoking, betting, keeping late hours,\r\nfrequenting casinos, etc.? Your mother and other prudent friends will\r\nassist you to find this out. Those who do not come up to the proper\r\nstandard, however agreeable they may be as acquaintance, certainly\r\ncannot make good husbands. In company of such, it behooves you to be\r\nwell on your guard, and accept no attention from them. Should you\r\nmarry such a one, you would be sure to be miserable.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, it is quite right that you should be careful about the\r\ncharacter of the young man who is paying court to you, it is of far\r\nmore importance to you that you should be careful about your own, and\r\nthis whether you marry or not. Indeed, a chief object in our being\r\nplaced in this world is that we may acquire good habits, and so be\r\nfitted to associate with the just made perfect in heaven!\r\n\r\nBe very guarded in your actions and demeanor. Cultivate purity of\r\nheart and thought.\r\n\r\nNo woman is fit to become a wife who is not perfectly modest in word,\r\ndeed, and thought. No young man, who is worth having, would ever\r\nentertain the thought for a moment of taking the girl for a wife who\r\nis habitually careless in her conversation and displays a levity in\r\nher manners. Young men may like your free and hearty girls to laugh\r\nand talk with, but as to taking one for a wife, let me assure you they\r\nwould not tolerate the idea for a moment.\r\n\r\nYou may at times be unavoidably compelled to hear a vulgar word spoken\r\nor an indelicate allusion made; in every instance maintain a rigid\r\ninsensibility. It is not enough that you should cast down your eyes or\r\nturn your head, you must act as if you did not hear it; appear as if\r\nyou did not comprehend it. You ought to receive no more impression\r\nfrom remarks of this character than a block of wood. Unless you\r\nmaintain this standing, and preserve this high-toned purity of manner,\r\nyou will be greatly depreciated in the opinion of all men whose\r\nopinion is worth having, and you deprive yourself of much influence\r\nand respect which it is your privilege to possess and exert.\r\n\r\n\r\n             COURTSHIP, AFTER ALL, IS A MOMENTOUS MATTER.\r\n\r\nAfter taking all the counsel that may be offered, you must at last, in\r\na great measure, rely on your own judgment. Within a few short months\r\nyou have to decide, from what you can see of a man, whether you will\r\nhave him in preference to your parents, friends, and all others that\r\nyou know, to be a life companion. What can you do? How shall you\r\njudge? How arrive at a correct conclusion? My dear young girl, there\r\nis only One who can assist you. He, in His mercy to your helplessness\r\nand weakness, has given to every virtuous and pure-minded woman a\r\nwonderful, mysterious, and subtle instinct; a peculiar faculty that\r\ncannot be analyzed by reason, a faculty that men do not possess, and\r\none in which they do not generally believe. At this all-important\r\nperiod, this eventful crisis in your life, this womanly instinct\r\nguides and saves you. You can feel in a moment the presence or\r\ninfluence of a base, sensual, and unworthy nature. An electric-like\r\nthrill animates you, and you are naturally repulsed from him. When\r\nyour suitor is a man of incongruous temper, ungenial habits, and of a\r\nmorose and unsympathetic disposition, this same precious, divine\r\ninstinct acts, and the man feels, though he cannot tell why, that all\r\nhis arts and aspirations are in vain. It will seldom be necessary for\r\nyou to tell him verbally of his failure; but should such a one blindly\r\ninsist upon intruding his attentions, do not hesitate to tell him\r\nkindly but firmly your decision. Should your suitor be one who is\r\nworthy, who will make you happy, this same blessed instinct will\r\nwhisper in your soul the happy news. From the first interview there is\r\nfrequently thrown around the maiden a peculiar, undefined spell; she\r\nwill feel differently in his presence, and watch him with other eyes\r\nthan she has for the rest of men, and in due time, when he shall ask\r\nher to decide upon the question which shall seal the temporal and\r\neternal destiny of two human souls, she will gladly respond, giving in\r\nloving trustfulness that which is the most precious, the most enviable\r\nthing on earth: a maiden's heart, a woman's love.\r\n\r\nMany persons, of both sexes, however amiable and pure their minds may\r\nbe, should conscientiously abstain from marriage. This applies to all\r\nwho have a tendency to consumption, scrofula, insanity, or any other\r\nof those diseases which are so frequently transmitted to offspring.\r\nThis very important matter is not sufficiently known, and therefore is\r\nnot attended to as it ought to be; hence the great amount of sickness\r\nand early death among children.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to inherit qualities is very evident in the case of\r\ndrunkards, whose children are often inclined to practice the vice of\r\ntheir parents. The children of the blind, and of the deaf and dumb,\r\nare also liable to be afflicted as their parents were. These facts go\r\nfar to show that it is literally true that the sins of the fathers are\r\nvisited upon the children. It is, however, gratifying to know--and\r\nthere are many well-attested cases to prove it--that whereas the\r\nchildren born to a man while he was addicted to drunkenness were\r\nsimilarly addicted to that vice, those born after he gave up his\r\nvicious indulgence, and by that means improved his bodily health, were\r\nfree from the evil tendency.\r\n\r\nOne strong reason\r\n\r\n\r\n               WHY NEAR RELATIONS SHOULD NOT INTERMARRY\r\n\r\nis that, as the same general tendencies prevail in families, when the\r\nparents are nearly related they are very likely to have the same evil\r\ntendency, whatever that may be; and, therefore, there is a great\r\nprobability that their children will also have the same, but more\r\nstrongly developed, and, consequently, the difficulty of their\r\novercoming it will be much increased.\r\n\r\nHow plainly, then, is it the duty of those about to marry, as well as\r\nof those who are married, to strive to their utmost, with God's help,\r\nto overcome disorderly habits of every kind; for, be assured, it is\r\nonly by such means they can hope to be blessed with good and healthy\r\nchildren, and thereby contribute to their own happiness, and at the\r\nsame time to the improvement of the race as subjects both of this\r\nworld and of heaven.\r\n\r\nAs it is by no means certain that you will marry, and the time may\r\ncome when it will no longer be convenient to your parents to support\r\nyou, it will be good for you, keeping these contingencies in mind, to\r\nqualify yourself to earn your own maintenance by some honest industry.\r\nYou will then have a right feeling of independence, and not be tempted\r\nto marry, as too many young women do, not from the true principle of\r\nsincere affection, but mainly for a living. They may thus obtain a\r\ncompetence, and jog on comfortably, but they have no right to expect\r\nthat genuine happiness which I recommend you to aim at. When, too, you\r\nsee so many left widows, with small families, and, as we say, totally\r\nunprovided for, you will become sensible of the soundness of the\r\nadvice I am offering you. As the Lord's tender mercies are over all\r\nHis works, it is evident, from what is occurring around us, that\r\ntrouble and adversity are better suited to the state of some people,\r\nto prepare them for their eternal destination, than any amount of\r\nprosperity would be. The poor are no less His children than the rich,\r\nand he cares equally--that is, infinitely--for them all. It is\r\ncertainly wise, then, to be prepared to meet adversity, should He\r\nsuffer it to come upon you.\r\n\r\nAgain, suppose you should not have any suitable offer of marriage,\r\nsuch as you would feel it your duty to accept, you are not on that\r\naccount to be disheartened, and fancy yourself overlooked by\r\nProvidence.\r\n\r\nSingle life is evidently the best for some persons; they escape many\r\ntroubles which perhaps they would find it very hard to bear. There are\r\nmany ways in which single people can lead a useful life, and be\r\n\r\n\r\n                     AS HAPPY AS THE DAY IS LONG.\r\n\r\nNo one that is actively useful can be unhappy. What do you see around\r\nyou? Many, I admit, who are not so happy as we should like them to be;\r\nbut in most cases, if we could fully investigate the matter, it would\r\nperhaps be found to have arisen from their thinking too much about\r\nthemselves and not enough for others. But, on the other hand, it not\r\ninfrequently happens, when a woman is left, and sees that the support\r\nand welfare of herself and children depend on her own exertions, she\r\nis enabled to so successfully put forth her energies and to employ her\r\ntalents which, till she needed them, she hardly knew she possessed, as\r\nto surprise both herself and the most sanguine of her friends.\r\n\r\nNow, it must be confessed that we are fallen creatures, and therefore\r\nprone to evil. We are consequently always in danger of going wrong\r\nand forming bad habits, but our Heavenly Father watches over us at all\r\ntimes and gives us power to \"refuse the evil and choose the good.\" We\r\nare, I know full well, too much inclined to yield to evil influences;\r\nstill, as we always have divine aid if we implore it, I am not sure\r\nthat, on the whole, it is not as easy to acquire good habits as bad\r\nones. This much is certain, that whichever we acquire, they are likely\r\nto remain with us and are not easily to be got rid of.\r\n\r\nAmong the subjects deserving attention as affecting our happiness is\r\none on which, perhaps, I am not entitled to say much. I refer to\r\ndress. Now, I hold it to be a duty for people to dress well--that is,\r\naccording to their position, means, and age; and this not so much for\r\ntheir own sakes as for the sake of giving pleasure to others. It is, I\r\nadmit, difficult to determine how much of one's income should be\r\ndevoted to dress, but I think few will deny that at present dress\r\noccupies too much time, attention, and money. For my own part, I\r\nconfess I am most affected by female dress, and although certainly I\r\nlike to see women well dressed, and would rather see them a little too\r\nfine than slovenly, I am often pained at witnessing the extravagance\r\nand, to me, ridiculous taste exhibited. Whenever I see a handsome and\r\nexpensive dress trailing in the dirt, I regard it as culpable waste\r\nand in bad taste, and when I see it accidentally trodden on I am not\r\nsorry. I am inclined to believe that many women can hardly find time\r\nor opportunity to perform any useful duty; they have quite as much as\r\nthey, poor things, can do to take care of their dress. I also believe\r\n(and this is the serious point of the matter) that many a young man is\r\ndeterred from soliciting a maiden in marriage by knowing that his\r\nmeans would not enable him to let her dress as he is accustomed to see\r\nher, and this is doubtless one of the many reasons why so many of both\r\nsexes remain unmarried. I hold, too, that whatever forms an obstacle\r\nto marriage has a tendency at the same time to obstruct the entrance\r\nto heaven.\r\n\r\nI will now allude to some of the duties which will devolve upon you as\r\na wife; and recollect that it is on the faithful discharge of these\r\nduties that your happiness, here and hereafter, mainly depends. All\r\nlabor is honorable, and you know who it is that says, \"My Father\r\nworketh hitherto, and I work.\" Being married, you must make your\r\nhusband feel\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \"THERE IS NO PLACE LIKE HOME.\"\r\n\r\nHis business will probably take him from home most of the day, and it\r\nshould be your care, as I doubt not it will be your delight, to see to\r\nhis comfort, both before he starts and when he returns. It may\r\nsometimes happen in his fighting the battle of life that he has to\r\nencounter much that is unpleasant, and he may return home depressed.\r\nYou will then have to cheer him, and be assured no one can do it so\r\neffectually, so pleasantly--aye, and so easily--as yourself.\r\n\r\nIt is not to sweep the house, and make the bed, and darn the socks,\r\nand cook the meals, chiefly, that a man wants a wife. If this is all\r\nthat he needs, hired help can do it cheaper than a wife. If this is\r\nall, when a young man calls to see a young lady, send him to the\r\npantry to taste the bread and cake she has made. Send him to inspect\r\nthe needlework and bedmaking; or put a broom into her hands and send\r\nhim to witness its use. _Such things are important_, and the wise\r\nyoung man will quietly look after them. But what a true man most wants\r\nof a true wife is her companionship, sympathy, courage, and love. The\r\nway of life has many dreary places in it, and a man needs a companion\r\nto go with him. A man is sometimes overtaken with misfortune; he meets\r\nwith failure and defeat; trials and temptations beset him; and he\r\nneeds one to stand by and sympathize. He has some stern battles to\r\nfight with poverty, with enemies, and with sin; and he needs a woman\r\nthat, while he puts his arm around her and feels that he has something\r\nto fight for, will help him fight; that will put her lips to his ear\r\nand whisper words of counsel, and her hands to his heart and impart\r\nnew inspirations. All through life--through storm and through\r\nsunshine, conflict and victory, and through adverse and favoring\r\nwinds--man needs a woman's love. The heart yearns for it. A sister's\r\nor a mother's love will hardly supply the need. Yet many seek for\r\nnothing further than success in housework. Justly enough, half of\r\nthese get nothing more; the other half, surprised beyond measure, have\r\ngot more than they sought. Their wives surprise them by bringing a\r\nnobler idea of marriage, and disclosing a treasury of courage,\r\nsympathy, and love.\r\n\r\nAnd I would here caution you against giving way to little\r\nmisunderstandings in early married life. Sometimes trifling matters,\r\nfor want of some forbearance or concession on one side on the other,\r\nperhaps on both sides, accumulate into serious results. These\r\ndifferences might be avoided by married partners studying each other's\r\npeculiarities of character, with the aim of mutually correcting, in a\r\nkindly spirit, any wrong tendency or temper which may sometimes show\r\nitself. Should you find you have inadvertently given pain to your\r\nhusband, do not rest until you have ascertained the cause of his\r\ndisquiet and succeeded in allaying the unhappy feeling. The earnest\r\ndesire to please each other should by no means terminate on the\r\nwedding day, but be studiously continued through married life. Each\r\nshould always endeavor to think the best of the other, and instantly\r\nreject every thought that might tend to weaken the bond of mutual\r\npreference and perfect trust.\r\n\r\nIf he be wise, he will leave the housekeeping entirely to you; his\r\ntime and attention can be better employed elsewhere. To enable you to\r\ndo this wisely, you should, long before you marry, become familiar\r\nwith the quality and prices of articles of consumption, and where they\r\ncan best be obtained. Every wife should be able to cook well, whether\r\nshe has to do it herself or not. Health and good humor greatly depend\r\nupon the food being of good quality, well cooked, and nicely served\r\nup. She should also be able, if needful, to make and mend her own and\r\nchildren's clothes.\r\n\r\nToo much importance cannot be attached to cleanliness. Men may be\r\ncareless as to their own personal appearance, and may, from the nature\r\nof their business, be negligent in their dress, but they dislike to\r\nsee any disregard in the dress and appearance of their wives. Nothing\r\nso depresses a man and makes him dislike and neglect his home as to\r\nhave a wife who is slovenly in her dress and unclean in her habits.\r\nBeauty of face and form will not compensate for these defects. The\r\ncharm of purity and cleanliness never ends but with life itself. These\r\nare matters that do not involve any great labor or expense. The use of\r\nthe bath, and the simplest fabrics, shaped by your own supple fingers,\r\nwill be all that is necessary. These attractions will act like a\r\nmagnet upon your husband. Never fear that there will be any influence\r\nstrong enough to take him from your side.\r\n\r\nAn experience of many years of observation has convinced me that where\r\na pure, industrious, and cheerful wife meets her husband with a bright\r\nsmile on the threshold of her dwelling, that man will never leave the\r\nhome for any other place.\r\n\r\nAs all people are liable to illness, every young woman should aim at\r\nbeing an efficient nurse. In case of illness, it is now generally\r\nadmitted that good nursing is of more value than medicine. To a sick\r\nhusband, a little gruel or other trifle prepared and given by his\r\nwife's own hands will confer much more benefit than if prepared and\r\ngiven by another. Should it happen to you to fall ill, you may expect\r\nyour husband to do his best; but you must not be surprised if he is\r\nnot your equal in that department. Nursing is one of the many useful\r\nthings which women can do better than men. A practical knowledge of\r\nnursing will enable you to be useful beyond your own family, and will\r\nenhance your value as a neighbor.\r\n\r\nYou have often, I trust, experienced the pleasure of serving others\r\nfrom disinterested motives, and found that the pleasure has been\r\ndeeper and purer when you have engaged in doing good to those who\r\ncould not make you any return. This you have found to be the case\r\nwherever you have had charge of a baby--one of those little ones of\r\nwhom the Lord says: \"Their angels do always behold the face of my\r\nFather which is in heaven.\" You have perhaps been surprised to find\r\nhow easy it was to perform such a duty, and let me assure you that you\r\nmay always expect to find it easy to perform your duty in that state\r\nof life to which it shall please God to call you. He never requires\r\nanything from any of His creatures beyond what He gives them power to\r\ndo. He is no hard task-master. You have only to look to Him and do\r\nyour best, and then you may safely leave the result in His hands.\r\n\r\nOf all God's creatures, I know no happier one than a young mother with\r\na good husband and a healthy baby. I say a _healthy_ baby, for that\r\nimplies healthy parents, especially a healthy mother. She may justly\r\nfeel proud that God has intrusted a young immortal to her care, and\r\nshe should at all times bear in mind that it is His gift. While it is\r\non all hands considered honorable to hold a commission from the\r\nPresident, and to fill a high office, contributing to the welfare of\r\nmany people, a mother may feel her office at least as honorable,\r\nseeing she has intrusted to her the rearing and training of an\r\nimmortal being, and that she holds her commission direct from the King\r\nof Kings. For, recollect, it is only by God's blessing that she\r\nbecomes a mother; for such is the present state of society that many\r\nvery worthy married people have not the privilege of offspring,\r\nalthough they are intensely fond of children and seem to have no other\r\nearthly want. They may, nevertheless, be very useful, and therefore\r\nhappy, in a different sphere, by the adoption of nephews and nieces or\r\nin some similar way.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    AT THE BIRTH OF HER FIRST CHILD\r\n\r\nthere is opened in the mother's heart a new well of love, such as she\r\nhad not known before; and although she may fancy that this is all\r\nspent upon her babe, it is not so, for she loves her God, her husband,\r\nand everybody else better than ever. The father, too, is similarly\r\naffected; he also has a warmer love for his wife and for all his\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\nA similar idea is well expressed by Moehler, a German writer, who says:\r\n\"The power of selfishness, which is inwoven with our whole being, is\r\naltogether broken by marriage, and by degrees love, becoming more and\r\nmore pure, takes its place.\" When a man marries he gives himself up\r\nentirely to _another_ being; in this affair of life he first goes out\r\nof himself, and inflicts the first deadly wound on his egotism. By\r\nevery child with which his marriage is blessed, nature renews the same\r\nattack on his selfhood, causes him to live less for himself, and\r\nmore--even without being distinctly conscious of it--for others; his\r\nheart expands in proportion as the claimants upon it increase, and,\r\nbursting the bonds of its former narrow exclusiveness, it eventually\r\nextends its sympathies to all around.\r\n\r\nWhenever a mother is supplying her baby with the food which God has so\r\nwisely provided for it, or is ministering to any other of its numerous\r\nand increasing wants, she may feel that everything she does for it is\r\npleasing to her Heavenly Father and has its immediate reward in the\r\ndelight she experiences in the act.\r\n\r\nI can fancy that when a mother has washed her baby, and before she\r\ndresses it has a good romp with it, smothering it with kisses, calling\r\nit all the beauties and darlings and pets and jewels she can think of,\r\nand talking any amount of nonsense at the top of her voice--the baby\r\nall the while cooing, chirping, or even screaming with delight--at\r\nsuch a time, I say, I can easily fancy that the angels are looking on\r\napprovingly and enjoying the scene. And why not? \"Of such is the\r\nkingdom of heaven.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the time that an infant first becomes conscious of its wants, and\r\nlong afterwards, it looks to its mother to supply them all, fully\r\nbelieving her able to do so. She is, in fact, in place of God to it,\r\nand it would be well for many of us if we trusted our Heavenly Father\r\nas simply and as fully as the infant does its earthly mother.\r\n\r\nThose who know no better, when they see a mother patiently watching\r\nher sleeping babe, might wonder that she does not feel the want of\r\ncompany. She has, however, company that they know not of, and of which\r\neven she herself may not be conscious. If only our eyes were open, we\r\nmight see that she is not the only one that is so engaged--that\r\nangels are also occupied in watching the babe and in supporting her.\r\nI entirely agree with Dr. Watts, where, in his \"Cradle Hymn,\" he makes\r\nthe mother say:\r\n\r\n    \"Hush! my babe, lie still and slumber,\r\n    Holy angels guard thy bed.\"\r\n\r\nYou probably know the beautiful Irish superstition that when a baby\r\nsmiles in its sleep the angels are whispering to it.\r\n\r\n\"Before I became a father, I took little or no interest in babies; I\r\nrather thought them troublesome things. But the arrival of one of my\r\nown wrought a great change in me. It enlarged at once my views and my\r\nheart, and I had higher and stronger motives to exertion. My interest\r\nin them has not yet begun to weaken, and I have no reason to think it\r\never will.\"\r\n\r\nGirls are differently constituted from boys. God makes the intellect\r\npredominate in males, and affection in females. Accordingly, a little\r\ngirl early shows a love for a doll, regarding it quite as her baby and\r\nnever taking into account that it is not alive. She has many of a\r\nmother's cares and anxieties, as well as pleasures, about it; indeed,\r\nas many as she is then capable of. It is a constant source of\r\namusement and employment to her. In all this we may plainly see the\r\nhand of Providence. It forms a suitable introduction to some of the\r\ninteresting and important duties which will devolve on her if it\r\nshould be His good pleasure for her to become a mother.\r\n\r\nYou will, I dare say, readily see the object I now have in view. It is\r\nthat I wish to impress on you how desirable it is that you should take\r\nevery opportunity of becoming acquainted with the habits and wants of\r\nbabies, and the best way of managing them. The more you have to do\r\nwith them the more you will like the labors, and the easier and more\r\ndelightful it will become. It is fair that, before you have children\r\nof your own, you should get your knowledge as to the management of\r\nthem by experience with other people's. I take it for granted you will\r\nat all times do your best for them. You will then have but little\r\ncause to fear accident; and if accident should happen, as with all\r\nyour care it sometimes will, you will have more confidence in your\r\npowers, and will be more likely to do what is best at the moment, than\r\nif you were unused to children. Much of the disease and early death\r\nthat happens among children arises from the ignorance of the mothers,\r\nwho, however, are much more to be pitied than blamed in the matter.\r\nThey had never been taught their duties toward their future\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nFew mothers are, perhaps, sufficiently aware of the great influence\r\nwhich their manners, habits, and conversation have upon the tender\r\nminds of their children, even from birth. The child should grow up\r\nwith a feeling of reverence for its parents, which can only be the\r\ncase when wisdom, as well as affection, is exercised in its bringing\r\nup. Hence the necessity of the mother fitting herself, both\r\n_intellectually_ and _morally_, for her sacred office, that the child\r\nmay become accustomed to yield perfect obedience to her wishes, from a\r\nprinciple of love, and may acquire, as it advances in life, the habit\r\nof yielding a like obedience to that which is right.\r\n\r\nAs you well know that you are not perfect yourself, you must be\r\nprepared to find that your husband has also his imperfections, and it\r\nis no unimportant part of your duty to help him to get rid of them.\r\nIndeed, it is one of the highest uses of marriage for each partner to\r\nassist the other on the journey to the heavenly Canaan. But before you\r\nattempt to point out a fault in him, consider how you had best proceed\r\nso as to attain your object; for unless you adopt a judicious mode,\r\nand an affectionate as well as earnest manner, you may do as much harm\r\nas good. You must also carefully watch your opportunity; for what\r\nwould be favorably received at one time and under certain\r\ncircumstances, might under other circumstances give offence and\r\naltogether fail of the good effect intended and hoped for. You do not\r\nknow how powerful you may be for good to your husband. There is much\r\ntruth in the saying, \"A man is what a woman makes him.\"\r\n\r\nPrevious to your marriage it will be expedient for you not to give\r\nyour lover that full and unlimited confidence which it will be your\r\nduty--and your inclination, too--to give him when he becomes your\r\nhusband. I refer chiefly to family and other private matters, not to\r\nanything he ought to know to enable him to judge of your character and\r\nposition. Many unhappy marriages have been brought about through the\r\nyoung woman letting it be known that she has \"great expectations.\" A\r\nworthless fellow may, in consequence, have succeeded in winning her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThere is another point to which I must just allude before concluding\r\nthis address. It is doubtless the order of Providence for marriage to\r\ntake place, when possible, on our arriving at years of maturity. But I\r\nwould guard you against the evil results of _too early_ marriage,\r\nbefore either body or mind is perfectly matured. We scarcely need\r\nconsult either medical or moral science to satisfy ourselves on this\r\nby no means trifling point. We may find in society too many sad\r\ninstances of such immature and indiscreet unions. The minds of young\r\npersons should be expanded by a certain amount of experience in the\r\nworld before entering upon engagements involving so many momentous\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nIn your daily walks abroad, if you examine the countenances of those\r\nyou meet, you will doubtless be led to conclude that there is a great\r\ndeal of disease and misery in the world; but judging from my own\r\nobservation, I think you will find that the greater number of persons\r\nexhibit signs of health and happiness. Much of the disease, and misery\r\nwith which the world is afflicted is the direct result of the\r\nmisconduct of the individuals themselves; but no little of it is\r\nattributable to their parents, who have neglected or violated God's\r\nlaws of health, their misconduct thus affecting their descendants to\r\nthe \"third and fourth generation.\" I cannot, therefore, too much\r\nimpress upon you the importance of your honestly trying to find out\r\nany bad habits to which you are inclined, with a view to getting rid\r\nof them, one by one, and supplying their place by good habits. By\r\npursuing this course you will not only do much for your own happiness,\r\nbut also for that of your children, if God should bless you with a\r\nfamily. Children, you know, are often striking likenesses of their\r\nparents, and in their minds and habits they likewise often resemble\r\nthem. You should strive, then, to be good--not from mere self-love and\r\nthat you may get to heaven, but because your duty to others requires\r\nit.\r\n\r\nEarl Granville, when laying the foundation-stone of the Alexandria\r\nOrphanage, in England, thus expressed himself in reference to the\r\ngreat value of children: \"Few will deny that a child is 'an\r\ninestimable loan,' as it has been called, or refuse to acknowledge,\r\nwith one of our greatest poets, that the world would be a somewhat\r\nmelancholy one if there were no children to gladden it.\" Children,\r\nmore than any other earthly thing, equalize the conditions of\r\nsociety--to rich and poor they bring an interest, a pleasure, and an\r\nelevation which nothing else that is earthly does.\r\n\r\nNow, young people, before they think of engaging themselves, should\r\nclearly know each other's peculiar views of religion; because if they\r\ndiffer seriously on this point there is danger of it interfering with\r\nthat full confidence which is so essential to happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                          LOVE AND MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attraction of the sexes for each other, though based upon the dual\r\nprinciple of generation which pervades the living world and which has\r\nits analogies in the attractive forces of matter, yet pervades the\r\nwhole being.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LOVE IS NOT MERELY\r\n\r\nthe instinctive desire of physical union, which has for its object the\r\ncontinuation of the species--it belongs to the mind as well as to the\r\nbody. It warms, invigorates, and elevates every sentiment, every\r\nfeeling; and in its highest, purest, most diffusive form unites us to\r\nGod and all creatures in Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ALL LOVE IS\r\n\r\nessentially the same, but modified according to its objects and by the\r\ncharacter of the one who loves. The love of children for their\r\nparents, of parents for offspring, brotherly and sisterly love, the\r\nlove of friendship, of charity, and the fervor of religious love, are\r\nmodifications of the same sentiment--the attraction that draws us to\r\nour kindred, our kind; that binds together all races and humanity\r\nitself, resting on the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.\r\nIt is but natural that this love should vary in degrees. Attractions\r\nare proportional to proximity. Family is nearer than country; we\r\nprefer our own nation to the rest of the race.\r\n\r\nEach individual has, also, his own special attractions and repulsions.\r\nThere is love at first sight and friendship at first sight. We feel\r\nsome persons pleasant to us; to be near them is a delight. Generally\r\nsuch feelings are mutual--like flows to like, or as often, perhaps,\r\ndifferences fit into each other. We seek sympathy with our own tastes\r\nand habits, or we find in others what we lack. Thus the weak rest upon\r\nthe strong, the timid are fond of the courageous, the reckless seek\r\nguidance of the prudent, and so on. The sentiment of\r\n\r\n\r\n                       LOVE FOR THE OPPOSITE SEX\r\n\r\n--tender, romantic, passionate--begins very early in life. Fathers and\r\ndaughters, mothers and sons, have a special fondness for each other,\r\nas, also, have brothers and sisters; but the boy soon comes to admire\r\nsomeone, generally older than himself, who is not a relation. Very\r\nlittle girls find a hero in some friend of an elder brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FONDNESS FOR COUSINS\r\n\r\ngenerally comes more from opportunity than natural attraction, though\r\na cousin may have very little appearance of family relation. The law\r\nappears to be that free choice seeks the diverse and distant. A\r\nstranger has always a better chance with the young ladies of any\r\ndistrict than the young men with whom they have always been\r\nacquainted. Savages seek their wives out of their own tribe.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that naturally (I mean in a state of pure and\r\nunperverted nature, but developed cultivated, and refined by\r\neducation) every man loves womanhood itself, and all women so far as\r\nthey approximate to his ideal; and that in the same way every woman\r\nloves manhood, and is attracted and charmed by all its gentle, noble,\r\nand heroic manifestations. By such a man, every woman he meets is\r\nreverenced as a mother, sister, daughter, or, it may be, cherished in\r\na more tender relation, which should be at first, and may always\r\nremain, free from any sensual desire. Such love may have many objects,\r\neach attracting the kind and degree of affection which it is able to\r\ninspire. Such love of men for women, and women for men, may be free\r\nand will be free just in the degree in which it is freed from the\r\nbondage of sensual passion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SUCH LOVE HAS A DIRECT TENDENCY\r\n\r\nto raise men above the control of their senses. The more of such love\r\none has and the more it is diffused, the less the liability to sink\r\ninto the lower and disorderly loves of the sensual life.\r\n\r\nThe idea that every attraction, every attachment, every love between\r\nthe sexes must lead to marriage--that no love can be tolerated but\r\nwith that end in view--is a very false and mischievous one. It\r\ndeprives men and women of the strength and happiness they might have\r\nin pure friendships and pure loves, and it leads to a multitude of\r\nfalse and bad marriages. Two persons are drawn together by strong\r\nattractions and tender sentiments for each other who have no more\r\nright to be married than if they were brother and sister, but who have\r\nthe same right to love each other. But their true sentiments for each\r\nother, and consequent relation to each other, are not understood by\r\nthose around them and perhaps not by themselves. They are urged by the\r\nmisapprehension of others, by their expectation, by ignorant gossip,\r\nby the prejudice of society, based upon low and sensual estimates of\r\nlife, to marry; they find that they must either marry or lose the\r\nhappiness they have in each other's society, and they make the\r\nirrevocable mistake.\r\n\r\nWhen it is understood that there are\r\n\r\n\r\n                              OTHER LOVES\r\n\r\nthan that of marriage; when the special attraction that justifies\r\nunion for life, and the begetting of offspring, is discriminated from\r\nall the other attractions that may bring two souls into very near and\r\ntender relations to each other, there will be more happiness in the\r\nworld and fewer incomplete, imperfect, and, therefore, more or less\r\nunhappy, marriages. Nothing can be more detestable than that playing\r\nwith fire which goes by the name of\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FLIRTATION;\r\n\r\nbut there are men and women who have the happiness of living and of\r\nbeing tenderly and devotedly loved by persons of the opposite\r\nsex--loved purely, nobly, happily--without injury and with great good.\r\nWhen such loves are accompanied by perfect trust in the goodness,\r\npurity, truth, and honor of the beloved, there can be no jealousy, no\r\ndesire for selfish absorption, no fear of deprivation of any right.\r\nThere is no reason why a husband or a wife should limit the range of\r\npure and spiritual affection to near relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE MAN WHO CAN LOVE\r\n\r\na sister as sisters are often loved, may love in the same way, or as\r\npurely, any woman who might be his sister. As men and women learn to\r\npurify their lives, the world will grow more tolerant and love will\r\nbecome more universal. The tender and fervent exhortations to mutual\r\nlove to be found in the Gospels and Epistles of the New Testament are\r\nnow almost without a meaning. But they had a meaning to those to whom\r\nthey were addressed, and when we are better Christians, and bring our\r\nlives to the purity of Christian morality, they will have a meaning to\r\nus and we shall learn that, in a sense we have not dreamed of, God is\r\nLove.\r\n\r\n\r\n         IN THE HUMAN RACE ALL CIRCUMSTANCES POINT TO MONOGAMY\r\n\r\nas the lawful or natural condition. Males and females are born in\r\nalmost equal numbers. If there are two or three per cent. more of\r\nmales than females, the risks of life with males soon make the number\r\neven. Therefore, as a rule, no man can have more than one wife without\r\nrobbing his neighbor.\r\n\r\n_Polygamy_ is therefore a manifest injustice, and may become the most\r\ngrievous of all monopolies.\r\n\r\nChildren are the most helpless of all young creatures and require the\r\ncare of parents for the longest period. The care of a husband for his\r\nwife, and of a father for his child, is an evident necessity. The\r\nproper care and education of a single child should extend over at\r\nleast fifteen years, and that of a family may reach to thirty years,\r\nor throughout the greatest part of an ordinary life. During all\r\nperiods of pregnancy, childbearing, nursing, and the education and\r\ncare of a family, every woman has a right to the sympathy, sustaining\r\nlove, and constant aid of her husband. No man has a right to desert or\r\nleave helpless, or even dependent upon others, except in extraordinary\r\ncases, the mother of his children.\r\n\r\nMarriage, like celibacy, should be a matter of vocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE SPECIAL OBJECT OF MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nis to have children; the co-operating motive is that two persons drawn\r\nto each other by a mutual affection may live helpfully and happily\r\ntogether. A selfish marriage, for its merely animal gratifications--a\r\nmarriage in which strength, health, usefulness, often life itself, are\r\nsacrificed to sensuality and lust--is a desecration of a holy\r\ninstitution, and somewhat worse in its consequences than promiscuous\r\nprofligacy, for the consequences of that may not fall upon one's\r\nchildren and posterity.\r\n\r\nThere are many persons who have no right to marry. There should be a\r\nkind and amount of love that will justify and sanctify such a\r\nrelation. There should be a pure motive and the fixed intention of\r\nmaking the relation what it ought to be to husband, wife, and\r\nchildren. There should be a reasonable assurance of the power to\r\nprovide for a family. There should be that amount of health, that\r\nfreedom from bodily and mental disease, that physical and moral\r\nconstitution which will give a reasonable prospect of children whose\r\nlives will be a blessing to themselves and to society.\r\n\r\nWhen there is deformity of body, or an unhappy peculiarity of temper\r\nor mind liable to be inherited, people should not marry, or if they\r\nlive together, should resign the uses of marriage. People should\r\nconscientiously refrain from propagating hereditary diseases. Persons\r\nnear of kin are wisely forbidden to marry, for there is in such cases\r\nthe liability of imperfect generation--the production of blind, deaf,\r\nidiotic or insane offspring.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SHOULD MARRIAGE BE FOR LIFE?\r\n\r\nAs a rule, undoubtedly. Every real, proper, true marriage must be. It\r\ntakes a lifetime for a husband and wife to make a home and rear and\r\neducate and provide for a family of children. But what if people make\r\nmistakes and find that they are not suitably married? These are\r\nmistakes very difficult to remedy. If a man, after deliberately making\r\nhis choice of a woman, ceases to love her, how can he honorably\r\nwithdraw from his relation to her, and enter upon another,\r\n\r\n\r\n                       WHEN SHE STILL LOVES HIM,\r\n\r\nand is ready to fulfill her part of the contract? Laws cannot very\r\nwell provide for mistakes. If the distaste for each other be mutual,\r\nand both parties desire to separate, a separation may of course be\r\npermitted; but it is a serious question whether two such persons can\r\ngo into the world and find new partners, with justice to the rest. The\r\nlaw which permits of no divorce certainly bears hard upon individual\r\ncases; but if it leads to greater seriousness and care in forming such\r\nrelations, it may be, on the whole, the best thing for society that it\r\nshould be strictly observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                 WHEN TO MARRY--HOW TO SELECT A PARTNER\r\n                         ON RIGHT PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proper age to marry is a somewhat vexed question, but needlessly\r\nso, because that age varies much, according to temperament and other\r\ncircumstances relating to the individual. Although after puberty the\r\nsexual organs are capable of reproduction, yet it by no means follows\r\nthat they should be used for that purpose. Their early activity is\r\nintended for the perfection of the body and mind, and not for the\r\ncontinuation of the species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         VERY EARLY MARRIAGE,\r\n\r\ntherefore, should be avoided, because the nervous force expended in\r\namative indulgence is imperatively required in both sexes for\r\ndeveloping the physical and mental faculties. The zoosperms produced\r\nby the male in the first years of puberty are inferior in power and\r\nless capable of producing healthy offspring than those of mature\r\nyears. The early germs, also, of the female are less fitted for\r\nfecundation than those that appear later in life; nature evidently\r\nintending these early efforts to be used on the individuals themselves\r\nin building up their bodies, strengthening their minds, and preparing\r\nthem to reproduce their species in maturer years. There is a serious\r\nday of reckoning for early indulgence; for precocious persons (unless\r\ntheir constitutions are as powerful as their desires) who give way to\r\ntheir passions at their first exactions, barter their youth for their\r\nenjoyment, and are old and weary of the world at an age when people of\r\nmore moderate habits are only in the meridian of pleasure and\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   GENERALLY THE BEST AGE TO MARRY,\r\n\r\nwhere the health is perfect, is from twenty-one to twenty-five in the\r\nmale and from eighteen to twenty-one in the female. As a general rule,\r\nmarriages earlier than this are injurious and detrimental to health.\r\nMen who marry too young, unless they are of cold and phlegmatic\r\nconstitution, and thus moderate in their conduct, become partially\r\nbald, dim of sight, and lose all elasticity of limb in a few years;\r\nwhile women in a like position rarely have any bloom on their cheek or\r\nfire in their eye by the time they are twenty-five. And all profound\r\nphysiologists agree that from the same cause the mental faculties\r\nsuffer in the same ratio.\r\n\r\nA medium, however, is to be observed. It is not well to defer till\r\nmiddle age the period of connubial intercourse; for too tedious\r\nspinsterhood is as much calculated to hasten the decay of beauty as\r\ntoo early a marriage. Hence, there is rarely any freshness to be seen\r\nin a maiden of thirty; while the matron of that age, if her life has\r\nbeen a happy one, and her hymeneal condition of not more than ten\r\nyears' standing, is scarcely in the heyday of her charm's. And the\r\nsame rule will apply with equal force to the other sex; for, after the\r\nfirst prime of life, bachelors decay and grow old much faster than\r\nmarried men.\r\n\r\nThe rich are qualified for marriage before the poor. This is owing to\r\nthe superiority of their aliment; for very nutritious food, and the\r\nconstant use of wines, coffee, etc., greatly assists in developing the\r\norgans of reproduction; whereas the food generally made use of among\r\nthe peasantry of most countries--as vegetables, corn, milk,\r\netc.--retards their growth. Owing to this difference of diet, the\r\ndaughter of a man of wealth, who keeps a good table, will be as\r\nadequate to certain duties of married life at eighteen as the daughter\r\nof a humble peasant at twenty-one. Singular as it may seem, it is none\r\nthe less true, that love novels, amorous conversations, playing parlor\r\ngames for kisses, voluptuous pictures, waltzing, and, in fact, all\r\nthings having a tendency to create desire, assist in promoting puberty\r\nand preparing young persons for early marriage. Those who reach this\r\nestate, however, by artificial means and much before the natural\r\nperiod will have to suffer for it in after life.\r\n\r\nThe female who marries before the completion of her womanhood--that\r\nis, before her puberty is established--will cease to grow and probably\r\nbecome pale and delicate, the more especially if she become pregnant\r\nsoon after marriage. A person who is thus circumstanced will also be\r\nliable to abortions and painful deliveries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MARRIAGE, UNLESS\r\n\r\nunder very peculiar circumstances, should not take place until two or\r\nthree years after the age of puberty. Many instances could be cited of\r\nthe injurious effects resulting from not observing this rule. The case\r\nof the son of Napoleon I. is a notable instance, who, at the age of\r\nfifteen or sixteen, began his career of sexual indulgence, which ended\r\nhis life at the early age of twenty-one years. He was an amiable,\r\ninoffensive, and studious youth, beloved by his grandfather and the\r\nwhole Austrian court; and though the son of the most energetic man\r\nthat modern times has produced, yet, from his effeminate life, he\r\nscarcely attracted the least public attention.\r\n\r\nLet me, therefore, advise the male reader to keep his desires in\r\nleading-strings until he is at least twenty-one, and the female not to\r\nenter the pale of wedlock until she is past her eighteenth year; but\r\nafter these periods marriage is their proper sphere of action, and one\r\nin which they must play a part or suffer actual pain as well as the\r\nloss of one of the greatest of earthly pleasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MARRIAGES ARE MOST HAPPY\r\n\r\nand most productive of handsome and healthy offspring when the husband\r\nand wife differ, not only in mental conformation, but in bodily\r\nconstruction. A melancholy man should mate himself with a sprightly\r\nwoman, and _vice versa_; for otherwise they will soon grow weary of\r\nthe monotony of each other's company. By the same rule should the\r\ncholeric and the patient be united, and the ambitious and the humble;\r\nfor the opposites of their natures not only produce pleasurable\r\nexcitement, but each keeps the other in a wholesome check. In the size\r\nand form of the parties the same principles hold good. Tall women are\r\nnot the ideals of beauty to tall men; and if they marry such, they\r\nwill soon begin to imagine greater perfections in other forms than in\r\nthose of their own wives. And this is well ordered by nature to\r\nprevent the disagreeable results which are almost certain to grow out\r\nof unions where the parties have a strong resemblance.\r\n\r\nFor instance, tall parents will probably have children taller than\r\neither, and mental imbecility is the usual attendant of extreme size.\r\nThe union of persons prone to corpulency, of dwarfs, etc., would have\r\nparallel results; and so, likewise, of weakly and attenuated couples.\r\nThe tall should marry the short, the corpulent the lean, the choleric\r\nthe gentle, and so on, and the tendency to extremes in the parents\r\nwill be corrected in the offspring.\r\n\r\nApart from these considerations, there are reasons why persons of the\r\nsame disposition should not be united and wedlock. An amiable wife to\r\na choleric man is like oil to troubled waters; an ill-tempered one\r\nwill make his life a misery and his home a hell. The man of studious\r\nhabits should marry a woman of sense and spirit rather than of\r\nerudition, or the union will increase the monotony of his existence,\r\nwhich it would be well for his health and spirits to correct by a\r\nlittle conjugal excitement; and the man of gloomy temperament will\r\nfind the greatest relief from the dark forebodings of his mind in the\r\nsociety of a gentle, but lively and smiling partner.\r\n\r\nHowever, in some particulars the dispositions and constructions of\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MARRIED PEOPLE MUST ASSIMILATE\r\n\r\nor they will have but few enjoyments in common. The man of full habits\r\nand warm nature had better remain single than unite his destinies with\r\na woman whose heart repulses the soft advancements of love; and the\r\nsanguine female in whose soul love is the dominant principle should\r\navoid marriage with a very phlegmatic person, or her caresses, instead\r\nof being returned in kind, will rather excite feelings of disgust.\r\nThus the discriminations to be made in the choice of a partner are\r\nextremely nice.\r\n\r\nNature generally assists art in the choice of partners. We\r\ninstinctively seek in the object of our desires the qualities which we\r\ndo not possess ourselves. This is a most admirable arrangement of\r\nProvidence, as it establishes an equilibrium and prevents people from\r\ntending to extremes; for it is known that unions of dwarfs are\r\nfruitful of dwarfs, that giants proceed from the embrace of giants,\r\nand that offspring of parents alike irritable, alike passive, alike\r\nbashful, etc., inherit the prominent qualities of both to such a\r\ndegree as to seriously interfere with their prospects in the world.\r\n\r\nIt has another advantage. Through its means \"Every eye forms its own\r\nbeauty\"; hence, what one person rejects is the _beau ideal_ of\r\nanother's conceptions, and thus we are all provided for.\r\n\r\nIn fine, with man as with animals, the best way to improve the breed\r\nis to cross it, for the intermarriage of like with like and relative\r\nwith relative not only causes man to degenerate, but if the system\r\nbecame universal would in time bring the human race to a termination\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nA male or female with a very low forehead should carefully avoid\r\nmarriage with a person of like conformation, or their offspring will,\r\nin all probability, be weak-minded or victims to partial idiocy.\r\n\r\nThe system of crossing is so perfect that marriages between persons of\r\ndifferent countries are likely to be pleasant and fruitful. Speaking\r\non this subject, an English writer says: \"The Persians have been so\r\nimproved by introducing foreigners that they have completely succeeded\r\nin washing out their Mongolian origin.\" And the same author adds to\r\nthe effect that in those parts of Persia where there is no foreign\r\nintercourse the inhabitants are sickly and stunted, while in those\r\nthat are frequented by strangers they are large and healthy.\r\n\r\nTo make what is called\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \"A HANDSOME COUPLE,\"\r\n\r\nthe female should be about three inches less than the male, and the\r\nparties should be proportionately developed throughout their system.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        \"A WELL-FORMED WOMAN,\"\r\n\r\nsays a modern physiologist, \"should have her head, shoulders, and\r\nchest small and compact; arms and limbs relatively short; her\r\nhaunches apart; her hips elevated; her abdomen large and her thighs\r\nvoluminous. Hence, she should taper from the center, up and down.\r\nWhereas, in a well-formed man the shoulders are more prominent than\r\nthe hips. Great hollowness of the back, the pressing of the thigh\r\nagainst each other in walking, and the elevation of one hip above the\r\nother, are indications of the malformation of the pelvis.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the same writer I take the following, which is applicable here.\r\nIt is very correct in its estimates of beauty in both sexes:--\r\n\r\n\"The length of the neck should be proportionately less in the male\r\nthan in the female, because the dependence of the mental system on the\r\nvital one is naturally connected with the shorter courses of the\r\nvessels of the neck.\r\n\r\n\"The neck should form a gradual transition between the body and\r\nhead--its fullness concealing all prominences of the throat.\r\n\r\n\"The shoulders should slope from the lower part of the neck, because\r\nthe reverse shows that the upper part of the chest owes its width to\r\nthe bones and muscles of the shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"The upper part of the chest should be relatively short and wide,\r\nindependent of the size of the shoulders, for this shows the vital\r\norgans which it contains are sufficiently developed.\r\n\r\n\"The waist should taper a little farther than the middle of the trunk,\r\nand be marked, especially in the back and loins, by the approximation\r\nof the hips.\r\n\r\n\"The waist should be narrower than the upper part of the trunk and its\r\nmuscles, because the reverse indicates the expansion of the stomach,\r\nliver, and great intestine, resulting from their excessive use.\r\n\r\n\"The back of woman should be more hollow than that of man; for\r\notherwise the pelvis is not of sufficient depth for parturition.\r\n\r\n\"Women should have more extended loins than men, at the expense of the\r\nsuperior and inferior parts, for this conformation is essential to\r\ngestation.\r\n\r\n\"The abdomen should be larger in woman than in man, for the same\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n\"Over all these parts the cellular tissue, and the plumpness connected\r\nwith it, should obliterate all distinct projection of muscles.\r\n\r\n\"The surface of the whole female form should be characterized by its\r\nsoftness, elasticity, smoothness, delicacy, and polish, and by the\r\ngradual and easy transition between the parts.\r\n\r\n\"The moderate plumpness already described should bestow on the organs\r\nof woman great suppleness. Plumpness is essential to beauty,\r\nespecially in mothers, because in them the abdomen necessarily\r\nexpands, and would afterwards collapse and become wrinkled.\r\n\r\n\"An excess of plumpness, however, is to be guarded against. Young\r\nwomen who are very fat are cold and prone to barrenness.\r\n\r\n\"In no case should plumpness be so predominant as to destroy the\r\ndistinctness of parts.\"\r\n\r\nA male and female formed on the above models would be well matched and\r\nhave fine children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                    SEXUAL INTERCOURSE--ITS LAWS AND\r\n                     CONDITIONS--ITS USE AND ABUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an increasing and alarming prevalence of nervous ailments and\r\ncomplicated disorders that could be traced to have their sole origin\r\nfrom this source. Hypochondria, in its various phases, results from\r\nthe premature and unnatural waste of the seminal fluid. Then speedily\r\nensues a lack of natural heat, a deficiency of vital power, and\r\nconsequently indigestion, melancholy, languor, and dejection ensue;\r\nthe victim becomes enervated and spiritless, loses the very attributes\r\nof man, and premature old age soon follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        IT IS A PREVALENT ERROR\r\n\r\nthat it is necessary for the semen to be ejected at certain times from\r\nthe body; that its retention is incompatible with sound health and\r\nvigor of body and mind. This is a very fallacious idea. The seminal\r\nfluid is too precious--nature bestows too much care in its elaboration\r\nfor it to be wasted in this unproductive manner. It is intended, when\r\nnot used for the purpose of procreation, to be reabsorbed again into\r\nthe system, giving vigor of body, elasticity and strength to the mind,\r\nmaking the individual strong, active, and self-reliant. When kept as\r\nnature intended, it is a perpetual fountain of life and energy--a\r\nvital force which acts in every direction, a motive power which\r\ninfuses manhood into every organ of the brain and every fiber of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE LAW OF SEXUAL MORALITY\r\n\r\nfor childhood is one of utter negation of sex. Every child should be\r\nkept pure and free from amative excitement and the least amative\r\nindulgence, which is unnatural and doubly hurtful. No language is\r\nstrong enough to express the evils of amative excitement and unnatural\r\nindulgence before the age of puberty; and the dangers are so great\r\nthat I see no way so safe as\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THOROUGH INSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nregarding them at the earliest age. A child may be taught, simply as a\r\nmatter of science, as one learns botany, all that is needful to know,\r\nand such knowledge may protect it from the most terrible evils.\r\n\r\nThe law for childhood is perfect purity, which cannot be too carefully\r\nguarded and protected by parents, teachers, and all caretakers. The\r\nlaw for youth is perfect continence--a pure vestalate alike in both\r\nsexes. No indulgence is required by one more than the other--for both\r\nnature has made the same provision. The natures of both are alike, and\r\nany--the least--exercise of the amative function is an injury to one\r\nas to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MEN EXPECT\r\n\r\nthat women shall come to them in marriage chaste and pure from the\r\nleast defilement. Women have a right to expect the same of their\r\nhusbands. Here the sexes are upon a perfect equality.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, Dr. Carpenter (physiological works) has written like\r\na man of true science, and, therefore, of true morality. He lays it\r\ndown as an axiom that _the development of the individual and the\r\nreproduction of the species stand in an inverse ratio to each other_.\r\nHe says: \"The augmented development of the generative organs at\r\npuberty can only be rightly regarded as _preparatory_ to the exercise\r\nof the organs. The development of the _individual_ must be completed\r\nbefore the procreative power can properly be exercised for the\r\ncontinuance of the race.\" And in the following extract from his\r\n\"Principles of Human Physiology,\" he confirms my statement respecting\r\nthe unscientific and libertine advice of too many physicians: \"The\r\nauthor would say to those of his younger readers who urge the wants of\r\nnature as an excuse for the illicit gratification of the sexual\r\npassions, 'try the effects of _close mental application_ to some of\r\nthose ennobling pursuits to which your profession introduces you, in\r\ncombination with _vigorous bodily exercise_, before you assert that\r\nappetite is unrestrainable and act upon that assertion.' Nothing tends\r\nso much to increase the desire as the continual direction of the mind\r\ntoward the objects of its gratification, whilst nothing so effectually\r\nrepresses it as a determined exercise of the mental faculties upon\r\nother objects and the expenditure of nervous energy in other channels.\r\nSome works which have issued from the medical press contain much that\r\nis calculated to excite, rather than to repress, the propensity; and\r\nthe advice sometimes given by practitioners to their patients is\r\nimmoral as well as unscientific.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                      EVERY MAN AND EVERY WOMAN,\r\n\r\nliving simply, purely, and temperately--respecting the laws of health\r\nin regard to air, food, dress, exercise, and habits of life--not only\r\ncan live in the continence of a pure virgin life when single, and in\r\nthe chastity which should be observed by all married partners, but be\r\nstronger, happier, and in every way better by so living.\r\n\r\nChastity is the conservation of life, and the consecration of its\r\nforces to the highest use. Sensuality is the waste of life, and the\r\ndegradation of its forces to pleasure divorced from use. Chastity is\r\nlife; sensuality is death.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  FROM THE AGE OF PUBERTY TO MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nthe law, is the same for both sexes--full employment of mind and body,\r\ntemperance, purity, and perfect chastity in thought, word, and deed.\r\nThe law is one of perfect equality. There is no license for the male\r\nwhich is not equally the right of the female. There is no\r\nphysiological ground for any indulgence in one case more than in the\r\nother. No man has any more right to require or expect purity in the\r\nwoman who is to be his wife than the woman has to require and expect\r\npurity in her husband. It is a simple matter of justice and right. No\r\nman can enter upon an amative relation with a woman, except in\r\nmarriage, without manifest injustice to his future wife, unless he\r\nallow her the same liberty; and also without a great wrong to the\r\nwoman, and to her possible husband.\r\n\r\nIt is contended that the sins of men against chastity are more venial\r\nthan those of women, because of the liability of women to have\r\nchildren. But men are also liable to be the fathers of children, who\r\nare deeply wronged by the absence of paternal care. The child has its\r\nrights, and every child has the right to be born in honest,\r\nrespectable wedlock, of parents able to give it a sound constitution\r\nand the nurture and education it requires. The child who lacks these\r\nconditions is grievously wronged by both father and mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE LAW OF MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nis, that a mature man and woman, with sound health, pure lives, and a\r\nreasonable prospect of comfortably educating a family, when drawn to\r\neach other by the attraction of mutual love, should chastely and\r\ntemperately unite for offspring. The sexual relation has this chief\r\nand controlling purpose. The law of nature is intercourse for\r\nreproduction. Under the Christian law, marriage is the symbol of the\r\nunion of Christ with the Church; husband and wife are one in the Lord;\r\nthey are to live in marriage chastity, not in lust and uncleanness;\r\nand there cannot be a more hideous violation of Christian morals than\r\nfor a husband to vent his sensuality upon a feeble wife; against her\r\nwishes and when she has no desire for offspring and no power to give\r\nthem the healthy constitutions and maternal care which is their right.\r\n\r\nThe law of Christian morality is very clear. It is the sexual union\r\nfirst and chiefly for its principal object. It is for the husband to\r\nrefrain from it whenever it is not desired; whenever it would be\r\nhurtful to either; whenever it would be a waste of life; whenever it\r\nwould injure mother or child, as during pregnancy and lactation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     A MAN WHO TRULY LOVES A WOMAN\r\n\r\nmust respect and reverence her, and cannot make her the victim of his\r\ninordinate and unbridled, selfish and sensual nature. He will be ever,\r\nfrom the first moment of joyful possession to the last of his life,\r\ntender, delicate, considerate, deferent, yielding to her slightest\r\nwishes in the domain of love, and never encroaching, never trespassing\r\nupon, never victimizing the wife of his bosom and the mother of his\r\nbabes. We have romance before marriage, we want more chivalry in\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nThis is not the world's morality, yet it seems to one the world must\r\nrespect it. This, high and pure Christian morality is not always\r\nenforced by Christian ministers, some of whom yield too much to human\r\nsensuality and depravity, instead of maintaining the higher law of\r\nChristian purity, which is but nature restored or freed from its\r\nstains of sin. The world requires that unmarried women should be\r\nchaste, while it gives almost unbridled license to men. A girl\r\ndetected in amours is disgraced and often made an outcast. In young\r\nmen such irregularities are freely tolerated. They are \"a little\r\nwild\"; they \"sow their wild oats\"; but open profligacy, the seduction\r\nof innocence, the ruin of poor girls, adultery, harlotry and its\r\ndiseases do not hinder men from marrying, nor from requiring that\r\nthose they marry should have spotless reputations. It is not for a\r\nmoment permitted that women in these matters should behave like men,\r\nand a pure girl is given to the arms of a wasted debauchee, and her\r\nbabes are perhaps born dead, or suffer through life with syphilitic\r\ndiseases, while she endures a long martyrdom from disordered,\r\ndiseased, and unrestrained sensuality. For the unmarried, young men,\r\nsoldiers, sailors, and all who do not choose to bear the burdens of a\r\nfamily, society has its armies of prostitutes--women like others, and\r\nmore than others, or in less reputable fashion, the victims of the\r\nunbridled lust of men. They are everywhere tolerated as\r\n\r\n\r\n                          \"NECESSARY EVILS,\"\r\n\r\nand, in some places, protected or regulated; and, from economical or\r\nphilanthropic considerations, or both, combined efforts are made to\r\nfree them from the contagious diseases which for some centuries have\r\nbeen a curse attending this form of the violation of the laws of\r\nnature--one of the consequences of lust which is the divorce of the\r\nsexual instinct from its natural use and purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Christian\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LAW OF MARRIAGE,\r\n\r\nas set down in the Holy Scriptures, and defined by the best writers on\r\nmoral theology, is in harmony with nature, in consonance with the\r\nhigher nature of man. \"God hath set the earth in families.\" Adultery\r\nis a sin, because it disorders that divine arrangement. Fornication is\r\na sin, because it prevents pure marriages. Prostitution is a sin,\r\nbecause it is a sacrifice of women, who might be wives and mothers, to\r\nthe selfish lusts of men. All useless indulgence is a waste of life,\r\nand a kind of suicide. In a pure marriage union, men and women unite\r\nthemselves with God in acts of creative power. The progress of\r\nhumanity depends upon individual development and the conditions at\r\ngeneration and gestation. With culture and a harmonized development,\r\nwe acquire a higher and more integral life. When two parents are in\r\ntheir highest condition and in\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A TRUE UNION\r\n\r\nwith each other, the child combines the best qualities of both\r\nparents. When parents are not in the unity of a mutual love, the child\r\nmay be inferior to either parent. The intensity of mutual love tends\r\nto the reproduction of the best faculties of both parents in the\r\nchild. When men or women are exhausted or diseased the race\r\ndeteriorates. Health is therefore one of the conditions of progress.\r\n\r\n\"It is all very fine,\" I shall be told, \"to talk of purity and\r\nchastity; but we must take men as they are. How are you going to make\r\nmen pure and chaste, and respectful of the purity of women? How can\r\nyou get men with strong amative propensities to live like anchorites?\"\r\n\r\nHow can you get men to do anything right, or refrain from any wrong\r\nthing? There are three motives--fear of punishment, hope of reward,\r\nand sense of right or the principle of duty. The first of these is the\r\nlowest, but often the most effectual; the second is higher, and\r\nappeals to hope and the love of happiness; the third, the highest of\r\nall motives, pure and unselfish as the love of truth, as in\r\nmathematics, acts on noble minds with great power. Men of real\r\nconscientiousness love the right for its own sake. They are just from\r\nlove of justice; pure from a sense and love of purity. They love good,\r\nand God as the source of all good; and do right, not from fear or\r\nhope, but from pure love.\r\n\r\nWe must appeal to all motives. Men refrain from theft and other\r\ndishonest conduct from the dread of disgrace and punishment, because\r\nthey see that \"honesty is the best policy,\" and from a sense of\r\njustice and regard to the rights of property, or a sense of honor\r\nwhich makes a mean action impossible. By similar motives great numbers\r\nare restrained from drunkenness and other vices. Children are to be\r\nrestrained from impurity by the fear of the terrible consequences of\r\nunnatural indulgence in causing disease and pain, by the hope of a\r\npure, healthy and happy life of love in manhood and womanhood, and by\r\na sense of the beauty and holiness of chastity and the sacredness of\r\nthe functions by which the race is recreated and preserved. The\r\nreligious feelings that our bodies are to be kept pure, healthy, and\r\nholy in every way as the temples of the Holy Ghost cannot be too early\r\ninstilled into the infant mind, which is open to the highest\r\nsentiments of veneration, devotion, and heroic religion. In youth\r\nthere are the same motives. Indulgence in solitary vice is\r\nself-destructive of all that youth most values--a profanation of his\r\nown body.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SEDUCTION\r\n\r\nis a desecration of what he should hold in the most tender reverence.\r\nTo the young man, womanhood should be sacred, and every woman, mother,\r\nsister, beloved of the present or the future, should never be wronged\r\nby one thought of impurity. In this matter instinct goes with right.\r\nThe inward voice supports the outer law of morality. Before men can\r\nbecome bad, their instinctive modesty must be broken down. Unless very\r\nbadly born, with disordered amativeness, hereditary from a diseased\r\nand lustful parentage, they must be perverted and corrupted before\r\nthey can act immodestly and impurely.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WOMEN ARE PROTECTED\r\n\r\nby a strong public sentiment around them. They have the dread of\r\ndisgrace. For them to yield to their own affectionate desires, or the\r\nsolicitations of a lover, is a fall, is ruin. They have the hope of a\r\nloving husband, a happy home, and the respect of society. And in woman\r\npassion has commonly less force, and the sentiment of modesty and\r\npurity more power. Women are weak in yielding to solicitation, giving\r\n\r\n\r\n                         EVERYTHING FOR LOVE;\r\n\r\nbut we see how protective of female virtue are these motives to vast\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nMen can perfectly restrain the sensual part of their natures whenever\r\nthey have a strong motive to do so. A child would be simply mad who\r\nwas not controlled by the presence of father, mother, and persons he\r\nrespected or feared. Young men have no difficulty when they are in the\r\ncompany of pure women. They are in no trouble when their lives are\r\nfull of mental and muscular activity, and particularly if their habits\r\nof eating simply and temperately, of refraining from heating and\r\nexciting stimulants, and sleeping in cold beds and fresh air, are such\r\nas health requires. There needs but the strong will to live purely in\r\nany one, and at any age, the will that comes from the high motives of\r\nconscience and religion, or all motives combined. A strong sense of\r\nwhat is just and right controls even the motions of our bodies and\r\nactions which seem to be involuntary. A man who has a vivid sense of\r\nthe right and duty of refraining from sensuality, and preserving his\r\nown purity of mind and body and the chastity of all women, will do so\r\neven in his dreams. When the will is right, all things are soon\r\nbrought into its subjection. The mind controls the organization, and\r\nthe life forces are directed into other channels. A strong man, full\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LIFE AND LOVE,\r\n\r\ncan safely hold a virgin in his arms, and respect her virginity, if he\r\nhave but the motives and the will to do so. If he be pure in his\r\nwill, how can he commit impurity? If a woman be sacred in his eyes,\r\nhow can he profane her? It is not that men have not the power of\r\nrestraint, the power to do right; it is that they lack the motive.\r\nThey have lost the sense of right; they are even impelled to do wrong\r\nby the pressure of opinion around them. Boys and young men are driven\r\ninto libertinage by the ridicule of their companions. Vice is\r\nconsidered manly. They seek sensuality in an evil emulation, as they\r\nlearn to smoke, or gamble, or drink; and, later on, vanity has often\r\nmore to do with excess than the force of lust. Young men seduce girls\r\nthat they may boast of it. They keep mistresses because it is the\r\nfashion. They exhaust themselves because they wish to give a high idea\r\nof their manly powers. Even in marriage, women are injured and have\r\ntheir health destroyed by yielding weakly, or from\r\n\r\n\r\n                        A FALSE SENSE OF DUTY,\r\n\r\nto a husband whose own motive is the desire to acquit himself manfully\r\nin what he considers his marital duties. Men and women are, in\r\nthousands of cases, wretched victims to what they imagine to be the\r\nwants or expectations of each other. A man, ignorant of the nature of\r\nwomen and the laws of the generative function, goes on in a process of\r\nmiserable exhaustion, to please his wife. She submits, sometimes in\r\npain, often in disgust, weariness, and weakness, to what she dare not,\r\nfrom\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LOVE OR FEAR,\r\n\r\nrefuse. Men have to know what is right and to will to be right. This\r\nwill is omnipotent. God helps those who have the will, who have even\r\nthe desire, to do right.\r\n\r\nIf the presence of those we fear or reverence, respect or love,\r\nrestrain us from sin and stimulate us to right action, faith in the\r\nexistence and presence of God and angels, and the spirits of the\r\ndeparted, must have a more powerful and pervading influence. No one\r\nwho really believes in the existence of a Supreme Being, no one who is\r\nstrongly impressed with the reality of a spiritual life, can go on\r\ndoing what he knows to be wrong. A religious faith is therefore the\r\nmost powerful of all restraints from evil and incitement to good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                               MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WHAT IS MARRIAGE?\r\n\r\nMarriage is in law the conjugal union of man with woman, and is the\r\nonly state in which cohabitation is considered proper and\r\nirreprehensible. The marriage relation exists in all Christian\r\ncommunities, and is considered the most solemn of contracts, and,\r\nexcepting in Protestant countries, it is regarded as a sacrament. In\r\nsome countries its celebration falls under the cognizance of\r\necclesiastical courts only, but in the United States it is regarded as\r\nmerely a civil contract, magistrates having, equally with clergymen,\r\nthe right to solemnize it, though it is usually the practice to have\r\nit performed by a clergyman and attended with religious ceremonies.\r\nMarriage, as a legalized custom, is of very ancient origin. It is\r\ndoubtful whether even the primitive man was not governed in the\r\nintercourse of the sexes by some recognition of the union being\r\nconfined to one chosen one. No greater promiscuity can certainly be\r\nsupposed than occurs in the lower animals, where pairing is the law.\r\nThe nobler animals, as the lion, elephant, etc., never have but one\r\nmate, and even in case of death do not remate. As men advanced, civil\r\ncodes were inaugurated and certain protection given to the choice of\r\nthe parties. The earliest civil code regulating marriage, of which we\r\nhave any account, was that of Menes, who, Herodotus tells us, was the\r\nfirst of the Pharaohs, or native Egyptian kings, and who lived about\r\n3,500 years before Christ. The nature of his code is not known.\r\n\r\nThe Biblical account extends further back, but it does not appear that\r\nany laws existed regulating marriage, but each one was allowed to\r\nchoose his wife and concubines, and it is supposed that common consent\r\nrespected the selection. Next, Moses gave laws for the government of\r\nmarriage among the Israelites. The early Greeks followed the code of\r\nCecrops, and the Romans were also governed in their marital relations\r\nby stringent laws. In fact, the necessity of some law regulating the\r\nintercourse between the sexes must have become very apparent to all\r\nnations or communities at a very early period. It certainly antedates\r\nany legal regulations with regard to the possession of property. It is\r\nvery probable that every community did by common consent afford to\r\neach male one or more females, and the presumption is that such choice\r\nor assignment, as the case may have been, was respected by common\r\nagreement as inviolable. It is doubtful if ever promiscuity was the\r\nlaw or privilege with any community of men, even in their primitive\r\nstate. The possession of reason is antagonistic to such a belief; and\r\nman was most probably elevated above the beast by the faculty of\r\nreason in this respect as in others. Promiscuous indulgence is always\r\nevidence of debauchery, and a departure from that natural course which\r\nis prompted by an innate sense of propriety characterizing mankind.\r\nThe law is very indefinite with regard to what constitutes a legal\r\nmarriage. It is an unsettled question, both in England and this\r\ncountry, whether a marriage solemnized by customary formalities alone\r\nis legal, or if one characterized by the mere consent of the parties\r\nis illegal. The latter has been held as legal in some instances in\r\nboth countries. Kent, in his \"Commentaries,\" lays down the law that a\r\ncontract made so that either party recognizes it from the moment of\r\ncontract, and even not followed by cohabitation, amounts to a valid\r\nmarriage, and also that a contract to be recognized at some future\r\nperiod, and followed by consummation, is equally valid. It is\r\nunfortunate that the law is so undecided in this respect. The\r\ndecisions arrived at, for or against, were not dependent upon any\r\nrecognized law, but seem to be influenced by the character of the\r\ncases, either for favor or discountenance. As long as the law\r\nrecognizes cohabitation legal only in marriage, it seems to me that if\r\nconsummated under consent of the parties to bear marital relations\r\nwith each other, or promise of marriage, the act should be\r\nunhesitatingly pronounced as the equivalent of a valid marriage in all\r\ninstances. If cohabitation is only a marital prerogative, the law\r\nshould not stultify itself by recognizing it as possible to occur in\r\nany other relation. If either of the parties is married, the law\r\ndefines it as adultery, and very properly defines the punishment. It\r\nis necessary to the progress of the age that some such principle\r\nshould be recognized in common law so as not to subject the decision\r\nof the question to the individual opinion of any judge. It would at\r\nonce obviate the confusion of sentiment now held in regard to it and\r\nbesides arrest the decision in test cases from mere caprice of the\r\ntribunal. It is certainly as correct a principle as any in common law,\r\nand would, in its operations as a statute law, be free from injustice,\r\nand capable of doing much good.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         POLYGAMY--WHAT IT IS.\r\n\r\nPolygamy is a state in which a man has at the same time more than one\r\nwife. It has existed from time immemorial, especially among the\r\nnations of the East. The custom was tolerated by the laws of Moses,\r\nand, in fact, no positive injunction against it is found in the whole\r\nof the Old Testament. It is questionable whether more than one was\r\nrecognized as the _bona fide_ wife, the others simply being wives by\r\nright of concubinage. But if polygamy was in its strictest sense the\r\nlegal custom, it soon grew unpopular, for no trace of it is met in the\r\nrecords of the New Testament, where all the passages referring to\r\nmarriage imply monogamy as alone lawful. The custom has been almost\r\nuniversal in the East, being sanctioned by all the religions existing\r\nthere. The religion of Mohammed allows four wives, but the permission\r\nis rarely exercised except by the rich.\r\n\r\nIn Christian countries polygamy was never tolerated, the tenets of the\r\nChurch forbidding it, though Charlemagne had two wives, and Sigbert\r\nand Chilperich also had a plurality. John of Leyden, an Anabaptist\r\nleader, was the husband of seventeen wives, and he held that it was\r\nhis moral right to marry as many as he chose.\r\n\r\nIn England the punishment of polygamy was originally in the hands of\r\nthe ecclesiastics. It was considered a capital crime by Edward I., but\r\nit did not come entirely under the control of the temporal power until\r\na statute of James I. made it a felony, punishable by death. George\r\nIII. made it punishable by imprisonment or transportation for seven\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt is the offspring of licentiousness, and its advocates merely wish\r\nto give legal color to licentious habits. Every student of history\r\nwill find that as soon as a nation became morally depraved, polygamy\r\nwas practiced, and that monogamy was the rule in all countries truly\r\ncivilized.\r\n\r\nPolygamy has, of late years, been most shamefully revived and\r\noutrageously practiced in face of law by the Mormons. They claim it as\r\na religious duty, and defend the system by claiming that unmarried\r\nwomen can in the future life reach only the position of angels who\r\noccupy in the Mormon theocratic system a very subordinate rank, being\r\nsimply ministering servants to those more worthy, thus proclaiming\r\nthat it is a virtual necessity of the male to practice the vilest\r\nimmorality in order to advance the female to the highest place in\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nMormonism is a religion founded by Joseph Smith, who was born in\r\nSharon, E. V., Dec. 23rd, 1805, and killed at Carthage, Ill., June\r\n27th, 1844.\r\n\r\nIt is a most singular fact that a sect like the Mormons could have\r\nbeen established in a country peopled with such law-abiding people as\r\nof the United States, and maintain a system of marriage, antagonistic\r\nto the law and religion of the land. Neither could they have done so\r\nif they had not possessed two great virtues, temperance and industry.\r\nIt is to be hoped that the legal process now instituted for its\r\nabolition will effectually remove the blot from the national\r\nescutcheon.\r\n\r\nThe \"Oneida Communists\" are essentially polygamic, although they have\r\nno marriage system. They do not marry, and ignore all marriage codes.\r\nCohabitation is under no restrictions between the sexes. Marriage is\r\nalso not observed among the \"Shakers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MONOGAMY--WHAT IT IS.\r\n\r\nThis is the conjugal union of a male with one female only. We have\r\nseen that monogamy was coequal with civilization, and that most\r\nprobably the majority of the males had but one wife, even among\r\npolygamic nations. Universal polygamy is practically impossible, the\r\nscarcity of females and the poverty of the males forbidding it. The\r\nexcess of females is not so great in any country as to allow to each\r\nmale more than one wife, except the male portion is depleted by long\r\nand disastrous wars. Monogamy has done more for the elevation of the\r\nfemale than any other custom of civilization. The rich could only\r\nafford to practice polygamy, and should the poor imitate the example\r\nit would necessarily subject the wives to a state of serfdom. In the\r\neconomy of nature it is designed that the male should be the protector\r\nof the female, and that by his exertions the provision of food and\r\nraiment should be secured. In polygamous nations the female has not\r\nattained that social state that she has reached in countries where the\r\nmale is entitled to but one female as his wife. Woman's highest sphere\r\nis not in the harem or zenana, but in that dignified state in which\r\nshe is the sole connubial companion of but one man. It is debasing to\r\nher nature, and subversive of her dignity in the rank of humanity, to\r\nmake her the equal only with others in the marital union with one\r\nmale. She becomes only the true, noble and affectionate being when she\r\nis conscious of a superiority to others in the connubial companionship\r\nwith her accepted one. The female bird chirps but for her single mate,\r\nand she is pugnaciously monogamic, as well as virtuous, allowing\r\nneither male or female at or near her home. The spirit of independence\r\nshe gains by being the mate of but one male gains for her the victory\r\nover the intruders.\r\n\r\nThe physical and mental welfare of the female is also dependent upon\r\nmonogamic marriage. We have demonstrated that temperate indulgence is\r\nconducive to the sanitary condition of the sexes, and that absolute\r\nabstinence is opposed to the designs of nature. It is also evident\r\nthat the male is not endowed with greater power, vigor or capacity\r\nthan the female; therefore, confinement or limitation of the congress\r\nto the companionship of one male with one female, as in monogamic\r\nmarriage, gives the healthy balance to the marital union. The\r\npolygamic husband must either suffer from the consequences of\r\nexcessive indulgence or his wives from poverty of sexual\r\ngratification; probably both would be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               POLYANDRY\r\n\r\nis equally as proper as polygamy, yet it never in the history of man\r\nobtained a foothold. The system is more logical than polygamy, because\r\nthe wife's dependence would be distributed between two or more\r\nhusbands, in which case she would be better insured against poverty\r\nand her support would be guaranteed by greater probability.\r\n\r\nWe have now described the history and aspect of the two customs, and\r\nwill conclude the subject by remarking that a man is morally and\r\nphysically entitled to but one wife, and that a plurality is a great\r\nwrong to the female and in total opposition to the ordinance of\r\nnature. Wherever polygamy is the custom the female is held in slavish\r\nsubjection. It only prospers in proportion to the ignorance of the\r\nsex. Intelligent and civilized woman will always rebel against such\r\ndebasement and servitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MARRIAGE CUSTOMS.\r\n\r\nIt would probably be interesting to many to describe the marriage\r\nceremonies observed by different nations, but to enter into a\r\ndescriptive detail would occupy too much space. It is sufficient to\r\nsay that while some wives are wooed and won, others are bought and\r\nsold; while in some countries the husband brings the wife to his home,\r\nin others, as in Formosa, the daughter brings her husband to her\r\nfather's house, and he is considered one of the family, while the\r\nsons, upon marriage, leave the family forever. In civilized countries,\r\nthe ceremonies are either ministerial or magisterial, and are more or\r\nless religious in character; while in others, less civilized, the\r\ngaining of a wife depends upon a foot-race, in which the female has\r\nthe start of one-third the distance of the course, as is the custom\r\nin Lapland. In Caffraria, the lover must first fight himself into the\r\naffections of his ladylove, and if he defeats all his rivals she\r\nbecomes his wife without further ceremony. Among the Congo tribes, a\r\nwife is taken upon trial for a year, and if not suited to the standard\r\nof taste of the husband, he returns her to her patents. In Persia, the\r\nwife's status depends upon her fruitfulness; if she be barren, she can\r\nbe put aside. In the same country they have also permanent marriages\r\nand marriages for a certain period only--the latter never allowed to\r\nexceed ninety years.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the marriage ceremonies differ in nearly all countries. To us\r\nsome may appear very absurd, and yet our customs may be just as\r\namazing to them. It matters but little how a conjugal union is\r\neffected so long as sanctioned by law or custom and it obligates the\r\nparties, by common opinion, to observe the duties pertaining to\r\nmarried life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE BASIS OF A HAPPY MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nThe state of conjugal union should be the happiest in the whole of the\r\nexistence of either man or woman, and is such in a congenial marriage.\r\nYet in the history of very many marriages contentment or happiness is\r\npalpably absent and an almost insufferable misery is the heritage of\r\nboth parties. It is therefore important that previous to the marital\r\nunion the parties should take everything into consideration that\r\nfore-shadows happiness after marriage, as well as everything\r\ncalculated to despoil conjugal felicity.\r\n\r\nThe first requisite of congenial marriage is love. Without being\r\ncemented by this element the conjugal union is sure to be uncongenial.\r\nIt is the strongest bond, the firmest cord, uniting two hearts\r\ninseparably together. Love for the opposite sex has always been a\r\ncontrolling influence with mankind. It is the most elevating of all\r\nthe emotions and the purest and tenderest of all sentiments. It exerts\r\na wonderful power, and by its influence the grandest human actions\r\nhave been achieved. Of what infinite worth it is to either sex to be\r\ncompensated with a worthy and satisfying love, and how ennobling to\r\nthe impulses and actions it is to bestow the sentiment upon one worthy\r\nto receive and willing to return.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        LOVE IS THE MAINSPRING\r\n\r\nthat regulates the harmony of conjugal life, and without it there is a\r\nvoid in the machinery, productive only of jars, convulsive movement,\r\nand a grating and inharmonious action. The soul yearns for love and\r\nto love, and unless the desire is compensated human life is a blank\r\nand becomes a purposeless existence. Love ever stimulates the good and\r\nsuppresses the bad, if kept in a proper channel and guided by pure\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nAnother requisite of a happy marriage is health. No person has a moral\r\nright to engage in wedlock who cannot bring to his partner the\r\noffering of good health.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is _evenness of temper_. In the wooing days\r\neveryone is a lamb, and only becomes the howling wolf after marriage.\r\nCircumstances that ruffle the temper in the presence of the intended\r\nare but like the harmless squib, but would become like the explosive\r\ntorpedo in his or her absence or in after-marriage. Quarreling caused\r\nby matrimonial differences is the most frequent cause of infelicity,\r\nand most of it is caused by an innate irate temper of either husband\r\nor wife.\r\n\r\nThe _tastes_ should not be dissimilar. Some of them may be\r\nunimportant, but others are a fruitful source of disagreement. The\r\nsocial wife will never be contented with the unsocial husband, and the\r\ngay husband, though his gayety may not be commendable, will always\r\naccuse his wife if she lacks a social disposition to a great extent.\r\nThe religious wife will never excuse a tendency to irreligion in her\r\nhusband, and though he may be far from being immoral, she is unhappy\r\nif he does not participate in her devotions. The one devoted to\r\nchildren will never be happy with one having a natural repugnance for\r\nthem. In this way we might multiply facts illustrative of the\r\nimportance of an investigation into the similarity of taste previous\r\nto marriage. Great love, however, overcomes almost every obstacle.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE PARTIES SHOULD BE NEARLY OF ONE AGE.\r\n\r\nThe husband should be the elder. The union of the old husband to the\r\nyoung wife, or the reverse, is seldom a happy one. It is seldom that\r\nsuch a marriage occurs in which the incentive is not the wealth of\r\neither of the parties.\r\n\r\nMarriages are usually contracted to gratify various desires, as love,\r\nfortune or position. The results are more truthfully stated by an\r\neminent divine in the following:\r\n\r\n\"Who marries for love, takes a wife; who marries for fortune, takes a\r\nmistress; who marries for position, takes a lady.\"\r\n\r\nTo a man there is but one choice that he can rationally make, a\r\nmarriage of love. My female readers, I hope, will decide rather to wed\r\na husband than the master or the elegant gentleman.\r\n\r\nA little foresight, a little prudence, and a little caution will\r\nprevent in most cases the entrance into a marriage which, by the very\r\nnature of the alliance, is certain to be an unhappy and improper one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                     PREGNANCY--LABOR--PARTURITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no more eventful period in the history of woman than\r\nthat in which she first becomes conscious that the existence of\r\nanother being is dependent upon her own and that she carries about\r\nwith her the first tiny rudiments of an immortal soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SIGNS OF PREGNANCY\r\n\r\nare various. Many females are troubled with colic pains, creeping of\r\nthe skin, shuddering, and fainting fits immediately on conception\r\ntaking place. Where such symptoms occur immediately after connection,\r\nthey are a certain indication of impregnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A REMARKABLE CHANGE\r\n\r\ntakes place in the face in most cases, varying in time from three days\r\nto three months. The eyes are dull and heavy, and present a glassy\r\nappearance; the nose pinched up; the skin becomes pale and livid, and\r\nthe whole countenance appears as if five or ten years' advance in life\r\nhad been taken at a single step.\r\n\r\nAnother important and remarkable sign, and one the most to be relied\r\non, is an increase in the size of the neck. This often occurs at a\r\nvery early period, and many females, by keeping a careful daily\r\nmeasurement of the neck, can always tell when they are pregnant.\r\n\r\nA suppression of the menstrual flow is another strong presumptive\r\nsign. It is true a partial flow of the menses often occurs after\r\npregnancy, from the lower part of the womb, but when the flow is\r\nsuddenly stopped without any apparent cause, pregnancy is generally\r\nthe predisposing cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SOON AFTER CONCEPTION\r\n\r\nthe stomach often becomes affected with what is called morning\r\nsickness. On first awaking, the female feels as well as usual, but on\r\nrising from her bed qualmishness begins and perhaps while in the act\r\nof dressing retching and vomiting takes place.\r\n\r\nThis symptom may occur almost immediately after conception, but it\r\nmost frequently commences for the first time between two and three\r\nweeks after. Now and then it is experienced only during the last six\r\nweeks or two months of pregnancy, and subsides about the time the\r\nmovements of the child begin to be felt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHANGES IN THE BREAST\r\n\r\nare generally considered as strong signs of pregnancy. When two months\r\nof pregnancy have been completed, an uneasy sensation of throbbing and\r\nstretching fullness is experienced, accompanied by tingling about the\r\nmiddle of the breasts, centering in the nipples. A sensible alteration\r\nin their appearance soon follows, they grow larger and more firm. The\r\nnipple becomes more prominent, and the circle around its base altered\r\nin color and structure, constituting what is called the areola, and as\r\npregnancy advances milk is secreted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE PERIOD OF GESTATION,\r\n\r\nat which these changes may occur, varies much in different females.\r\nSometimes, with the exception of the secretion of the milk, they are\r\nrecognized very soon after conception; in other instances,\r\nparticularly in females of a weakly and delicate constitution, they\r\nare hardly perceptible until pregnancy is far advanced or even drawing\r\ntoward its termination.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the form and size of the breasts may be the result of\r\ncauses unconnected with pregnancy. They may enlarge in consequence of\r\nmarriage, from the individual becoming stout and fat or from\r\naccidental suppression of the monthly flow.\r\n\r\nThe changes which take place in the nipple, and around its base, are\r\nof the utmost value as an evidence of pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ABOUT THE SIXTH OR SEVENTH WEEK\r\n\r\nafter conception has taken place, if the nipple be examined it will be\r\nfound becoming turgid and prominent, and a circle forming around its\r\nbase, of a color deeper in its shade than rose or flesh color,\r\nslightly tinged with a yellowish or brownish hue, and here and there\r\nupon its surface will be seen little prominent points from about ten\r\nto twenty in number. In the progress of the next six or seven weeks\r\nthese changes are fully developed, the nipple becoming more prominent\r\nand turgid than ever, the circle around it of larger dimensions, the\r\nskin being soft, bedewed with a slight degree of moisture, frequently\r\nstaining the linen in contact with it; the little prominences of\r\nlarger size, and the color of the whole very much deepened.\r\n\r\nCalculations of the\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DURATION OF PREGNANCY,\r\n\r\nfounded upon what has been observed to occur after casual intercourse,\r\nor perhaps a single act, in individuals who can have no motive to tell\r\nus what is false, are likely to be correct. The conclusion drawn from\r\nthese is, that labor usually, but not invariably, comes on about 280\r\ndays after conception, a mature child being sometimes born before the\r\nexpiration of the forty weeks, and at other times not until that time\r\nhas been exceeded by several days. A case is on record where the\r\npregnancy lasted 287 days. In this case the labor did not take place\r\nuntil that period had elapsed from the departure of the husband for\r\nthe East Indies, consequently the period might have been longer than\r\n287 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   CHILDBIRTH IS A NATURAL PROCESS,\r\n\r\nand however complicated and painful habits or disease have made it,\r\nyet the work must be left to nature. Any efforts to assist or hurry\r\nmatters will only end in harm. The only cases where interference is\r\njustifiable is where her powers are exhausted or some malformation\r\nexists or malpresentation occurs. When labor is about to commence, the\r\nwomb descends into the bottom of the belly and the motions and weight\r\nof the child will be felt much lower down than usual. If in a natural\r\nposition the head will fall to the mouth of the womb and press upon\r\nit. This drives forward the membranes which retain the water at the\r\norifice, and at the proper moment they break and labor then commences.\r\n\r\nLabor is caused by involuntary contractions of the uterus and\r\nabdominal muscles. By their force the liquor amnii flows out, the head\r\nof the foetus is engaged in the pelvis, it goes through it, and soon\r\npasses out by the valve, the folds of which disappear. These different\r\nphenomena take place in succession and continue a certain time. They\r\nare accompanied with pains more or less severe, with swelling and\r\nsoftening of the soft parts of the pelvis and external genital parts,\r\nand with an abundant mucous secretion in the cavity of the vagina. All\r\nthese circumstances, each in its own way, favor the passage of the\r\nfoetus.\r\n\r\nIt is proper here to remark that parturition is not necessarily either\r\npainful or dangerous. It is well known that women in an uncivilized\r\nstate suffer very little pain or disablement in bringing forth\r\nchildren. Generally neither pregnancy nor labor interrupt the ordinary\r\navocation of the mother, except for an hour or two at the birth\r\nitself. The suffering and debilitating influences that often attend\r\nchildbirth now are caused by our unnatural modes of living and\r\nnonattention to the laws of health. Numerous well-authenticated\r\ninstances are known where women who had previously suffered with\r\nsevere labor in childbirth have, by attention to health and diet as\r\nhere shown, been delivered of fine healthy children with comparative\r\nease.\r\n\r\nFrom the\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BEGINNING OF PREGNANCY\r\n\r\nmore than ordinary care should be used in taking regular exercise in\r\nthe open air, being careful to avoid fatigue and overexertion. During\r\nthe whole period of pregnancy every kind of agitating exercise, such\r\nas running, jumping, jolting in a carriage, and plunging in cold\r\nwater, should be carefully avoided, as well as the passions being kept\r\nunder perfect control.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE DIET\r\n\r\nmust chiefly consist of fruits and farinaceous food, as sago, tapioca,\r\nrice, etc. In proportion as a woman subsists upon aliment which is\r\nfree from earthy and bony matter will she avoid pain and danger in\r\ndelivery; hence, the more ripe fruit, acid fruit in particular, and\r\nthe less of other kinds of food, but particularly of bread or pastry\r\nof any kind, is consumed, the less will be the danger and sufferings\r\nof childbirth. Nearly all kinds of fruit possess two hundred times\r\nless ossifying principle than bread or anything else made of wheaten\r\nflour.\r\n\r\nHoney, molasses, sugar, butter, oil, vinegar, etc., when\r\nunadulterated, are entirely free from earthy matter. Common salt,\r\npepper, coffee, cocoa, spices, and many drugs are much worse than\r\nwheaten flour in their hardening and bone-forming tendency, and should\r\ntherefore be avoided. The drink should be tea or lemonade made with\r\nwater, soft and clear, and, when practicable, distilled.\r\n\r\nNo mother who has adopted this mode of living but has blessed the\r\nknowledge of it, and it has saved many a young mother from needless\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nIn the third month of pregnancy, but not before, the belly begins to\r\nenlarge or swell, and gradually increases in size till the full term\r\nof pregnancy is completed. Between the sixteenth and twentieth week\r\nthe womb rises up into the belly, and the motion of the child is felt,\r\nwhich is called\r\n\r\n\r\n                              QUICKENING.\r\n\r\nThe first time a woman is with child this sensation of quickening is\r\nlike that of a bird fluttering within her; at other times she feels a\r\ntickling or pushing sensation, or the child gives a kick or a jump,\r\nand this, too, with so much energy as to move the petticoats, a book,\r\nor any light article she may have in her lap.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember these symptoms, and the order in which\r\nthey occur: first, cessation of the menses; second, morning sickness;\r\nthird, swelling and darting pains in the breast, and dark color around\r\nthe nipples; fourth, gradual enlargement of the abdomen or belly;\r\nfifth, the movement of the child.\r\n\r\nIn ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, if these symptoms are present\r\nthe woman is pregnant. Pregnant women are generally affected with\r\nheartburn, sickness of a morning, headache, and that troublesome\r\ndisease, toothache, which accompanies pregnancy; all of which may\r\nusually be avoided by keeping the bowels gently open with seidlitz\r\npowders, caster oil, or pills of rhubarb, which should be taken\r\noccasionally, either alone or in combination with colocynth and soap.\r\nA clyster made of warm soapsuds will often be sufficient if repeated\r\nevery few days; or senna and manna; and if there is any aversion to\r\ntaking medicine, give some simple articles, such as roasted apples,\r\nfigs, prunes, or anything that will quiet the stomach and prevent\r\ncostiveness of the bowels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE TOOTHACHE\r\n\r\noften complained of by pregnant women, and which may occur at any\r\nperiod, is seldom relieved by extraction, having its seat in the\r\nadjacent nerves of the face or jaws, and is neuralgic. The teeth ought\r\nnot to be drawn during pregnancy, unless urgently required, but should\r\nbe relieved by applying hot fomentations to the face, as a camomile\r\npoultice. Rubbing the jaw externally with spirits of camphor or\r\nlaudanum, or applying mustard plasters or blisters behind the ears,\r\nwill afford relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE CRAMPS OF THE LEGS. ETC.,\r\n\r\nin pregnancy, caused by the pressure of the enlarged womb on the\r\nnerves, are often troublesome, but not attended with any danger, and\r\nmay be speedily relieved by a change of posture, and friction, or\r\nrubbing with opodeldoc, spirits of camphor, or hot whisky and salt.\r\nPalpitation of the heart occurs frequently, and usually about the\r\nperiod of quickening. In general, it is the result of a disordered\r\nstomach and may be relieved by attention to diet and moderate doses of\r\nmagnesia and Epsom salts, of equal quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE PALPITATION OF THE HEART\r\n\r\nmay be produced by a morbid state of the nerves, and is then termed\r\nhysterical. Attention in all such cases should be paid to the diet,\r\nair, exercise, etc., with the view of improving the strength, the\r\nbowels being kept open by mild means. All exciting or agitating\r\nsubjects should be carefully avoided, and the mind of the pregnant\r\nwoman kept calm and tranquil; for the mind, in the early stages of\r\npregnancy, exercises the most powerful influence over the child\r\nthrough life; and how many peculiar traits of character have been\r\nindelibly fixed upon their offspring from these exciting causes is\r\nevident in many families.\r\n\r\nWhen the palpitation occurs from the state of the nerves, as before\r\ndescribed, producing uncomfortable feelings, a teaspoonful of the\r\ntincture of castor or asafoetida, with an equal quantity of compound\r\nspirits of lavender, mixed in a little water, will seldom fail to\r\nafford relief, which may, if necessary, be repeated on its recurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MORNING SICKNESS\r\n\r\nis one of the most painful feelings attendant on the pregnant state,\r\nand it is one of those which medicine commonly fails to relieve. A cup\r\nof camomile or peppermint tea, taken when first awaking, and suffering\r\nthe patient to be still for an hour, will frequently alleviate the\r\ndistressing sickness; but should it recur during the day, and if these\r\nmeans fail, two or three teaspoonfuls of the following mixture should\r\nthen be taken either occasionally or, when the vomiting and heartburn\r\nare more continual, immediately after each meal:\r\n\r\nTake of--\r\n    Calcined magnesia,                   One dram;\r\n    Distilled water,                     Six ounces;\r\n    Aromatic tincture of rhatany,        Six drams;\r\n    Water of pure ammonia,               One dram.\r\n\r\nMix. The anxiety and sometimes despondency of mind--in other words,\r\nlowness of spirits--to which pregnant women are more or less liable\r\ngreatly depends on the state of their general health and the natural\r\ntemper and character of the individual; but it can be greatly\r\naggravated, and may often be excited by circumstances or officious\r\npersons. Let me, then, urge upon you the _important necessity_ of\r\nkeeping the mind as tranquil and cheerful as possible, particularly\r\nduring the first four months of pregnancy. A judicious course of this\r\nkind will produce the most beneficial and well-balanced mind in the\r\nchild; while, if the contrary, a desponding and nervous temperament,\r\nwith many other peculiarities, will be the consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n               SURE TEST FOR THE DETECTION OF PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\nM. Nauche has found that the urine of pregnant women contains a\r\nparticular substance, which, when the urine is allowed to stand\r\nseparates and forms a pellicle on the surface. M. Enguiser, from an\r\nextensive series of observations, has confirmed the fact, and\r\nascertained that kisteine, as this particular substance has been\r\ncalled, is constantly formed on the surface of the urine of women in a\r\nstate of pregnancy. The urine must be allowed to stand for from two to\r\nsix days, when minute opaque bodies are observed to rise from the\r\nbottom to the surface of the fluid, where they gradually unite and\r\nform a continuous layer over the surface. This layer is so consistent\r\nthat it may be almost lifted off by raising it by one of its edges.\r\nThis is the kisteine. It is whitish, opalescent, slightly granular,\r\nand can be compared to nothing better than the fatty substance which\r\nfloats on the surface of soups after they have been allowed to cool.\r\nWhen examined by the microscope, it has the aspect of a gelatinous\r\nmass without determinate form; sometimes cubical shaped crystals are\r\ndiscovered on it, but this appearance is only observed when it has\r\nstood a long time, and is to be regarded as foreign to it. The\r\nkisteine remains on the surface for several days; the urine then\r\nbecomes turbid, and small opaque masses become detached from the\r\nkisteine and fall to the bottom of the fluid and the pellicle soon\r\nbecomes destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe essential character of the urine of pregnancy, then, is the\r\npresence of the kisteine; and the characters of the pellicle are so\r\npeculiar that it is impossible to mistake it for anything else. A\r\npellicle sometimes forms on the surface of the urine of patients\r\nlaboring under phthisis, abscess, or disease of the bladder, but may\r\nbe easily distinguished by this circumstance, that it does not form in\r\nsuch a short time as the kisteine, and that in place of disappearing,\r\nas this last, in a few days, it increases in thickness and at last is\r\nconverted into a mass of moldiness. There exists, likewise, a very\r\nmarked difference between its mucous aspect and that of kisteine; a\r\ndifference which is difficult to describe, but which is easily\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nKisteine appears to exist in the urine from the first month of\r\npregnancy till delivery. It has even been recognized in the urine of a\r\nfew gravid animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          \"PARTURIENT BALM,\"\r\n\r\n_For Rendering Childbirth Easy and Less Dangerous--A very Important\r\nMedicine._\r\n\r\nTake blue cohosh root, four ounces; lady's-slipper root and spikenard\r\nroot, of each one ounce; sassafras bark (of root) and clover, of each\r\nhalf an ounce. Bruise all, and simmer slowly for two hours in two\r\nquarts of boiling water. Strain, and add one pound of white sugar.\r\n\r\nDose: A wineglassful twice a day for two weeks or a month previous to\r\nexpected confinement, for the purpose of rendering parturition, or\r\nchildbirth, more easy.\r\n\r\nShould be taken by every pregnant woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ABORTION.\r\n\r\nAbortion, or miscarriage, means, in plain language, a woman losing her\r\nchild previous to the seventh month of her pregnancy; that is, before\r\nits due time. When this occurs after that period it is called\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PREMATURE LABOR.\r\n\r\nMiscarriage involves pain and weakness in addition to the loss of\r\noffspring, and is often a severe trial to the maternal constitution.\r\nIt may occur at any period of pregnancy, but particular stages are\r\nmore liable to the accident than others. These are generally\r\nconsidered to be about the time of the first menstruation after\r\nconception; again at the twelfth week, and toward the seventh month;\r\nand the liability is increased at those times which correspond to the\r\nmenstrual period. When abortion has once taken place it is more likely\r\nto occur again, and some have so strong a tendency to it that they\r\nnever go beyond a certain stage, but then invariably miscarry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE CAUSE OF ABORTION\r\n\r\nmay exist in the constitution of the female herself, being the result\r\nof weakness and irritability, or of an overfull habit or a diseased\r\ncondition of the womb; or the foetus, or child, may die or be\r\ndeficient in development, when it is cast off like a blighted fruit.\r\nSuckling after conception has taken place is not infrequently a cause\r\nof miscarriage. Active diseases occurring during pregnancy, such as\r\nfevers, severe inflammation, eruptive fevers, etc., are almost certain\r\nto occasion the expulsion of the uterine contents. Continued\r\ndiarrhoea and the action of strong purgative medicines, particularly\r\nthe aloetic, are dangerous. This is a very good reason for those who\r\nare pregnant avoiding all quack aperient medicines; they almost all\r\ncontain aloes, and may be very injurious. All undue exertion or\r\nagitation of body or mind, sudden jerks or jumps, riding on horseback\r\nin the early stage, or in a shaking carriage in the latter stages of\r\npregnancy, may any of them bring on miscarriage. To these may be\r\nadded: exertion of the arms in doing anything on a level above the\r\nhead; costive bowels and straining consequent therein; sexual\r\nindulgence, or, in plain language, too much connection with your\r\nhusband; and luxurious habits. Those who have once suffered from\r\nabortion ought to be extremely careful during succeeding pregnancies,\r\nand all ought to bear in mind the possibility of the occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE SYMPTOMS OF THREATENED ABORTION\r\n\r\nvary with the constitution. In the strong and plethoric it is often\r\npreceded by shivering and febrile symptoms and by a feeling of weight\r\nin the lower bowels. In the weak there is languor, faintness,\r\nflaccidity of the breasts, general depression, and pains in the back\r\nand loins. Intermittent pains, and discharge of blood from the\r\npassage, tell that the process has begun. If miscarriage occurs within\r\nthe first month or two after conception, the process may be\r\naccomplished with so little inconvenience as to escape notice and be\r\nmistaken for a menstrual period. More generally, however, the severity\r\nof the pain and an unusual clotted discharge of blood render the case\r\nevident. The pain, the discharge, and, at the same time, the danger of\r\nan abortion, are in proportion to the advancement of the pregnancy.\r\nWhen a miscarriage goes on, the pains increase in force and frequency,\r\nand continue, with discharge of blood, fluid or in clots, until the\r\novum, or first formation of the child, is expelled; after which both\r\nbecome moderated till they cease altogether and the red flow gives\r\nplace to a colorless one. It is very important that those in\r\nattendance upon the patient should examine every clot that comes away.\r\nIf large, tear it in pieces, that they may ascertain whether the\r\ncontents of the womb are expelled or not, for there is no safety or\r\nrest, where miscarriage is progressing, till it has taken place and\r\neverything is cast off.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          AS SOON AS A FEMALE\r\n\r\nexperiences threatenings of abortion she ought at once to retire to\r\nbed, upon a mattress, and keep perfectly quiet till every symptom has\r\ndisappeared. Sometimes this simple measure, _promptly adopted_, is\r\nsufficient to avert the threatened evil. If there is much feeling of\r\nfullness, and the patient is of full habit generally, eight or a dozen\r\nleeches may be applied to the lower part of the bowels; if there is\r\nfever, saline medicines may be given, such as the common effervescing\r\ndraft of carbonate of soda and tartaric acid or lemon juice; or, if\r\nthe bowels are much confined, seidlitz powders, assisting the action\r\nby cold clysters, if necessary. When the pains are severe,\r\nparticularly in the weak and irritable, twenty or thirty drops of\r\nlaudanum should be given, and may be repeated in a few hours if the\r\nsymptoms are not improved. In the case of profuse discharge, the\r\npatient should be kept very lightly covered, movement avoided, and\r\nevery article of food or drink given cold, or iced if possible,\r\nprovided the vital powers are not excessively reduced. Cloths dipped\r\nin cold or iced water should also be applied to the lower part of the\r\nbody and frequently changed. Acid drinks, with cream of tartar, may be\r\nfreely given. Ten or fifteen drops of elixir vitriol may be given in a\r\nwineglassful of water every two or three hours. Should slight\r\nfaintness come on, it is better not to interfere with it, but use\r\noutward remedies--camphor, cold water, vinegar, etc.--as they maybe\r\nsalutary. If it reaches to an extent to threaten life, stimulants, as\r\nbrandy and water, and others, must be had recourse to. Profuse and\r\ncontinued discharge, though it may not threaten life, must occasion a\r\nweakness which will take a long time to overcome, and which may\r\nultimately, if not properly attended to, promote the development of\r\nother diseases of the womb.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      IF THE FLOODING IS PROFUSE\r\n\r\nand uncontrolled by the means before mentioned, one grain and a half\r\nof sugar of lead may be given every two or three hours, and washed\r\ndown with a drink of vinegar and water, to which, if there is much\r\npain, add from five to ten drops of laudanum.\r\n\r\nPieces of linen or cotton cloth should be soaked in a strong solution\r\nof alum, or a decoction of oak bark; and then well oiled; with this\r\ncloth plug the passage or birthplace; or, some of this astringent wash\r\nmay be thrown up with a syringe.\r\n\r\nBut, during the time and after miscarriage, the general strength must\r\nbe supported by a strengthening diet, such as soups, meat, etc.,\r\navoiding stimulants as much as possible. Nevertheless, in some cases\r\nwine or malt liquors may be necessary in convalescence, or when\r\nrecovering, and if so may be assisted by tonic or strengthening\r\nmedicines, such as contain mineral acid. Bark or iron are generally\r\ngiven as the most appropriate remedies. The bowels will, in some\r\ncases, require strict attention, as indeed they do throughout, and for\r\nthis purpose castor oil is a good medicine, or clysters of cold or\r\ntepid water are most useful. A teaspoonful of Epsom salts dissolved in\r\nhalf a pint of water, either cold or slightly warmed, to which add\r\nfifteen drops of elixir vitriol, forms a most excellent and mild\r\npurgative, which should be taken before breakfast. In all cases where\r\nthe constitution of the woman has a tendency to miscarriage or\r\nabortion, a quiet state of mind should be observed, avoiding all\r\nviolent exertions, particularly lifting heavy weights. These\r\nprinciples of treatment are to be kept in mind in the management of\r\nmiscarriage:\r\n\r\nThe first, to prevent it, if possible, by rest, opiates, etc.\r\n\r\nThe second, to allay pain, moderate the discharge of blood, and to\r\nsave and support the strength of the patient.\r\n\r\nThe third, when abortion must take place, to expedite the separation\r\nof the ovum and free the contents of the womb. This is generally done\r\nby simply occasionally drinking cold water, and in difficult cases, if\r\nnecessary, by the administration of spurred rye. The dose is a strong\r\ninfusion or tea given every twenty or thirty minutes until the desired\r\neffect is produced, as long as the stomach will bear it.\r\n\r\nThe health of pregnant females should at all times be an object of\r\ngreat care and interest; and they should be impressed with the\r\nconviction that while\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BEARING THE FIRST CHILD\r\n\r\nthey may, by proper care and attention, lay the foundation for their\r\nfuture health and that of their offspring; while by neglect and\r\nimprudence in this matter, they may not only enfeeble their\r\nconstitution, but entail upon their children an inheritance of\r\ninfirmity and disease.\r\n\r\nMiscarriage, or abortion, which includes all cases in which delivery\r\ntakes place before the sixth month, seldom occurs without being\r\npreceded, or accompanied, or followed, by a morbid discharge of blood\r\nfrom the womb, which is commonly known by the name of _flooding_.\r\nAbortion, or miscarriage, takes place with the first pregnancy, and\r\nduring the first two months; therefore, great care should be observed\r\nduring this period, as any cause which either destroys the life of the\r\nchild in the womb or brings on morbid or premature contractions in\r\nthat organ may induce miscarriage. Coughing severely, or vomiting, a\r\nblow or fall, or a misstep leading to an effort to prevent falling,\r\nmay, and does frequently, result in miscarriage; and this having once\r\noccurred, it is, without proper care, exceedingly liable to be the\r\ncase again at the same period of a subsequent pregnancy. The same\r\nresult may follow any vivid moral impression; for fright, or mental\r\nexcitement by passion, or witnessing any accident, will be found often\r\nto end in miscarriage. In some healthy females, however, it occurs\r\nwithout any other cause than mere fullness of blood. A bleeding from\r\nthe womb is often in such cases a first symptom of abortion, and\r\nshould be attended to as early as possible before it goes to any\r\nconsiderable extent. The amount of flooding, in most cases, is in\r\nproportion to the early period of pregnancy at which it takes place,\r\nfor in the latter months there is seldom much blood lost. But there\r\nare cases in which pregnant women will lose blood repeatedly from the\r\nwomb and yet not miscarry, but these are very rare cases.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, the occurrence of a woman's flooding between the first\r\nand fourth months, unless very slight, or quickly relieved, is usually\r\nfollowed by a miscarriage; but as soon as the child and its membranes\r\nare both expelled by the contraction of the womb the flooding soon\r\nceases. In many such cases it is often very difficult, and sometimes\r\nimpossible, to deliver the afterbirth and membranes, which remain and\r\nfinally pass off after putrefaction has taken place, resulting in long\r\nand offensive discharges from the womb, and which, unless treated by\r\nthe most skillful management, frequently result in many internal\r\nmischiefs of a serious character, such as ulcers, cancers, etc.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, those who are constitutionally disposed to abortion, or\r\nhave a tendency to miscarriage, should take great care to preserve a\r\nquiet state of mind and to avoid all violent exertion; and all active\r\npurgatives should be avoided, and exposure to great heat or cold,\r\nduring the time of gestation or pregnancy.\r\n\r\nWhen the miscarriage has really taken place, and the foetus, or\r\nchild, is expelled, together with the contents of the womb, the same\r\nprecautions should in general be observed as in childbirth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TO PREVENT MISCARRIAGE,\r\n\r\nwhen it is threatened, or on the appearance of the first symptoms, the\r\npatient should lie down and be as quiet as possible; live on very\r\nlight diet; bowels be kept freely open; and an injection of thirty\r\ndrops of laudanum should be given in half a pint of slippery elm tea.\r\nShould flooding be present, cold lemonade should be drank freely, and\r\ncloths wet with cold or ice water applied to the thighs and lower part\r\nof the birthplace, which should be repeated until the flooding is\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MEANS OF PREVENTING ABORTION.\r\n\r\nTo prevent abortion, women of weak or relaxed habit should use solid\r\nfood, avoiding great quantities of tea, coffee, or other weak or\r\nwatery liquors. They should go soon to bed and rise early, and take\r\nfrequent exercise, but avoid fatigue. They should occasionally take\r\nhalf a pint of the decoction of lignum-vitae, boiling an ounce of it in\r\na quart of water for five minutes.\r\n\r\nIf of a full habit, they ought to use a spare diet and chiefly of the\r\nvegetable kind, avoiding strong liquors and everything that may tend\r\nto heat the body or increase the quantity of blood; and when the\r\nsymptoms appear, should take a dram of powdered nitre in a cup of\r\nwater gruel every five or six hours.\r\n\r\nIn both cases the patient should sleep on a hard mattress and be kept\r\ncool and quiet; the bowels should be kept regular by a pill of white\r\nwalnut extract or bitterroot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                             MENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough this is not a disease, but a healthy function, and as, from\r\nvarious causes, derangement of the function occurs, it is proper that\r\nit should be perfectly understood. Menstruation is the term applied to\r\nthe phenomenon that attends the rupture of what is called the\r\n_Graafian follicles_ of the ovaries and the discharge of an ova, or\r\negg. It is a bloody discharge from the female genitals; not differing\r\nfrom ordinary blood, excepting that it does not coagulate, and in its\r\npeculiar odor. The blood comes from the capillaries of the womb and\r\nvagina.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  MENOPHANIA, OR THE FIRST APPEARANCE\r\n\r\nof the menses, is usually preceded by a discharge of a fluid whitish\r\nmatter from the vagina, by nervous excitement, and by vague pains and\r\nheaviness in the loins and thighs, numbness of the limbs, and swelling\r\nand hardness of the breasts. The first appearance is an evidence of\r\ncapacity for conception. It generally appears about the age of\r\nfourteen, but varies from nine to twenty-four years. In warm climates\r\nwomen begin to menstruate earlier and cease sooner than in temperate\r\nregions; in the cold climates the reverse of this holds as a general\r\nrule. The manifestations of approaching puberty are seen in the\r\ndevelopment of the breasts, the expansion of the hips, the rounded\r\ncontour of the body and limbs, appearance of the purely feminine\r\nfigure, development of the voice, and the child becomes reserved and\r\nexchanges her plays for the pursuits of womanhood.\r\n\r\nMore or less indisposition and irritability also precede each\r\nsuccessive recurrence of the menstrual flux, such as headache,\r\nlassitude, uneasiness, pain in back, loins, etc. The periods succeed\r\neach other usually about every twenty-eight days, although it may\r\noccur every twenty-two, twenty, eighteen, fifteen, or thirty-two,\r\nthirty-five, or forty days. The most important element is the\r\nregularity of the return. In temperate climates each menstrual period\r\nordinarily continues from three to six days, and the quantity lost\r\nfrom four to eight ounces. The menses continue to flow from the period\r\nof puberty till the age of forty-five or fifty. At the time of its\r\nnatural cessation the flow becomes irregular, and this irregularity is\r\naccompanied occasionally by symptoms of dropsy, glandular swellings,\r\netc., constituting the _critical period_, _turn_ or _change of life_;\r\nyet it does not appear that mortality is increased by it, as vital\r\nstatistics show that more men die between forty and fifty than women.\r\n\r\nIt should be the\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DUTY OF EVERY MOTHER\r\n\r\nor female in charge of a child in whom age or actual manifestations\r\nsuggest the approach of puberty to acquaint her with the nature of her\r\nvisitation and the importance of her conduct in regard to it. She\r\nshould be taught that it is perfectly natural to all females at a\r\ncertain period, and that its arrival necessitates caution on her part\r\nwith regard to exposure to wet or cold. The author has made the\r\nacquaintance of the history of many cases of consumption and other\r\ndiseases which were directly induced by folly and ignorance at the\r\nfirst menstrual flow. The child is often kept in extreme ignorance of\r\nthe liability of womanhood occurring to her at a certain age, and,\r\nhence, when she observes a flow of blood escaping from a part, the\r\ndelicacy attached to the locality makes her reticent with regard to\r\ninquiry or exposure; she naturally becomes alarmed, and most likely\r\nattempts to stanch the flow by bathing or applying cold water to the\r\npart, thus doing incalculable mischief.\r\n\r\nThis purely feminine physiological function should be well studied and\r\nunderstood by all females. At least, they should know that the\r\nphenomenon is a natural one, liable to disorder, and that the best\r\ninterests of their general health demands care and prudence on their\r\npart to maintain regularity, etc., of the flow. Disregard of such a\r\nduty will surely entail much misery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 DELAYED AND OBSTRUCTED MENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\nWhen the menses do not appear at the time when they may naturally be\r\nexpected, we call it delayed or obstructed menstruation. It is,\r\nhowever, of great importance to know whether a girl is sufficiently\r\ndeveloped to make it necessary for the menses to appear, although she\r\nmay have reached the proper age. As long as the girl has not increased\r\nphysically, if she has not become wider across the hips, if her\r\nbreasts have not become enlarged, and if she experience none of the\r\nchanges incident to this period, an effort to force nature is\r\npositively injurious. In this case a general treatment will be called\r\nfor. She should be required to exercise freely in the open air, retire\r\nearly to bed and rise at an early hour in the morning. She should not\r\nbe allowed to be closely confined to school, if attending. Her diet\r\nshould be generous but free from all rich food, which will disorder\r\nthe stomach. If, however, she is fully developed, and she suffers from\r\ntime to time from congestions of the head, breast or abdomen, it will\r\nbe necessary to interfere. The following are symptoms which will\r\ngenerally be found in these cases: Headache, weight, fullness, and\r\nthrobbing in the center of the cranium and in the back part of the\r\nhead; pains in the back and loins; cold feet and hands, becoming\r\nsometimes very hot; skin harsh and dry; slow pulse, and not\r\ninfrequently attended with epilepsy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nIt is well for the patient, a few days before the period, to take a\r\nwarm hip bath or foot bath twice a day, and at night, when retiring,\r\nto apply cloths wet in warm water to the lower part of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe bowels should be kept open by some mild catharsis, as castor oil\r\nor a pill of aloes. If there is pain and fullness of the head during\r\nthe discharge, or before it, use the following:\r\n\r\n    Tincture of aconite leaves,          Two drams;\r\n    Tincture of belladonna,              One dram;\r\n    Tincture of cantharides,             One dram;\r\n    Morphia,                             Three grains;\r\n    Simple syrup,                        Quarter ounce.\r\n\r\nMix. Dose: One teaspoonful three times a day. If the pain is severe it\r\nmay be taken every two hours.\r\n\r\nBetween the monthly periods, if the system is weak, the following may\r\nbe taken:\r\n\r\n    Precip. carbonate of iron,        Five drams;\r\n    Extract of conium,                Two drams;\r\n    Balsam Peru,                      One dram;\r\n    Alcohol,                          Four ounces;\r\n    Oil wintergreen,                  Twenty drops;\r\n    Simple syrup,                     Eight ounces.\r\n\r\nDose: Two teaspoonfuls three times a day. Shake the mixture before\r\nusing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CHLOROSIS, OR GREEN SICKNESS.\r\n\r\nThis disease generally occurs in young unmarried females who are weak\r\nand delicate. It manifests itself about the age of puberty, and is\r\naccompanied by feeble appetite and digestion. There is no menstrual\r\ndischarge, or else it is very slight.\r\n\r\nIt is caused by innutritious food and residence in damp and\r\nill-ventilated apartments. It may be hereditary, all the females of\r\nthe family being liable to the same disease. Those who drink largely\r\nof tea, coffee, diluted acids, bad wines, and indulge in tight lacing;\r\nare predisposed to this disease. Among the exciting causes may be\r\nmentioned disturbing emotions, unrequited love, homesickness,\r\ndepression of spirits, etc. When we take into consideration the fact\r\nthat the cause of the disease is impoverishment of the blood, the\r\ntreatment will not be difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nExercise freely in the open air; protect the body from chilliness with\r\nwarm clothing and plenty of it. The patient should sleep on a mattress\r\nin a well-ventilated room. The diet should be nourishing without being\r\nstimulating. It is important that the habits should be regular, and\r\nthe mind kept cheerful by society and innocent amusements. Before the\r\nmedical treatment is commenced the exciting causes of the disease must\r\nbe removed. A complete change must be made in the existence of the\r\npatient. If she is confined closely at school, she must be removed; if\r\nshe is inclined to confine herself to the house, send her to the\r\ncountry. Picture to her the danger she is in by the continuance of\r\nsuch a life; give her plenty of outdoor exercise. The mental and moral\r\ncauses are the most difficult to remove, but a change of scenery and\r\nnew friends will do much towards it. For those who are shut up in\r\nfactories, or who work all day in a stooping position, a change of\r\nemployment must be made. A bath of tepid water in the morning,\r\nfollowed by a brisk rubbing, will be beneficial; also the frequent use\r\nof the sitting-bath, and the sponge bath in the evening. Active\r\nexercise should precede and follow all baths. During menstruation all\r\napplications of water should be omitted. The following remedies are\r\nrecommended by a famous Philadelphian doctor. They are to be taken on\r\nalternate days; that is, take No. 1 one day, No. 2 the next day, etc.:\r\n\r\nNo. 1.--Precip. carbonate of iron, five drams; extract of conium, two\r\ndrams; balsam Peru, one dram; oil cinnamon, twenty drops; simple\r\nsyrup, eight ounces; pulverized gum arabic, two drams. Mix. Dose: Two\r\nteaspoonfuls three times a day, every other day, after meals. Shake\r\nbefore using.\r\n\r\nNo. 2.--Tincture of nux vomica, one dram; syrup iodide of iron, one\r\nounce; simple syrup, four ounces. Mix. Dose: One teaspoonful three\r\ntimes a day, every other day, after meals.\r\n\r\nAnother treatment is as follows:\r\n\r\nClear the bowels with the following mixture: Sulphate of magnesia, one\r\nounce; nitrate of potash, ten grains; extract of liquorice, one\r\nscruple; compound infusion of senna, five and one-half ounces;\r\ntincture of jalap, three drams; spirit of sal volatile, one dram. Mix.\r\nDose: Two or three tablespoonfuls at a time, at intervals of two hours\r\nuntil an effect is produced. This is to be followed by sulphate of\r\niron, five grains; extract of gentian, ten grains. Make into three\r\npills and take a pill twice a day, with the compound aloes or rhubarb\r\npill every night.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PROFUSE MENSTRUATION--MENORRHAGIA:\r\n\r\nBy menorrhagia we understand an immoderate flow of the menses. There\r\nis no fixed amount of blood which is lost at the menstrual period, but\r\nit varies in different women. It will average, however, from four to\r\neight ounces. The quantity discharged may be estimated by the number\r\nof napkins used. Each napkin will contain about half an ounce, or one\r\ntablespoonful, so that eight napkins would contain four ounces;\r\ntwenty, ten ounces; etc. In some females the discharge may be\r\nexcessive without impairment of the general health.\r\n\r\nSome females are predisposed to uterine hemorrhages, from a relaxed or\r\nflabby state of the texture of the uterus. Frequent childbearing,\r\nabortion, high living, too prolonged and frequent suckling, may induce\r\nflooding. Among the exciting causes we may mention overexertion,\r\ndancing, falls, lifting heavy weights, cold, and mental excitement.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThe patient must lie down on a hard bed, and abstain from all\r\nstimulating food and drinks. The room should be cool and she should be\r\nlightly covered with bedclothes. Soak the feet in warm water, and if\r\nthe flowing is excessive apply cloths wrung out in vinegar and water\r\nto the lower bowels. The hips must be elevated higher than the head.\r\nOnly in extreme cases should plugging be resorted to. This may be\r\ndone by pieces of linen, about four inches square, thrust into the\r\nvagina until it is full, and a bandage applied between the legs. Cold\r\nhip baths and vaginal injections of cold water will be beneficial when\r\nthe hemorrhage is slight.\r\n\r\nUse also the following:\r\n\r\n    Diluted sulphuric acid,         Two drams;\r\n    Syrup of orange peel,           Two ounces;\r\n    Cinnamon water,                 One ounce.\r\n\r\nMix. Dose: A teaspoonful in a wineglassful of water two or three times\r\na day.\r\n\r\nIf there is much pain administer the following every two or three\r\nhours:\r\n\r\n    Morphia,             Quarter grain;\r\n    Cayenne,             Four grains;\r\n    Rosin,               Four grains.\r\n\r\nMix. Give in blackberry syrup.\r\n\r\n\r\n          PAINFUL MENSTRUATION--MENSTRUAL COLIC--DYSMENORRHEA.\r\n\r\nDysmenorrhea means a difficult monthly flow, and is always preceded by\r\nsevere pains in the back and lower part of the abdomen. It is caused\r\nby taking cold during the period; fright, violent mental emotions,\r\nobstinate constipation, sedentary occupations, smallness of the mouth\r\nand neck of the womb. Females subject to this trouble are generally\r\nrelieved by marriage. The symptoms are severe bearing-down pains in\r\nthe region of the uterus, like labor pains; restlessness, coldness,\r\nflashes of heat, with headache; aching in the small of the back, lower\r\npart of the abdomen, and thighs; the discharge is scanty, and contains\r\nshreds of fiber and clotted blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThe patient should immediately go to bed and cover up warmly.\r\nStimulating food and drinks should be avoided. Use a warm foot bath\r\nand sitting-bath, with hot poultices of hops or cloths wet in hot\r\nwater applied to the abdomen.\r\n\r\nIn the interval of the menses, take active exercise, with a tepid hip\r\nbath three nights in the week, injecting some of the water high up in\r\nthe vagina. Keep the bowels open by a pill of aloes and myrrh, and\r\ntake a small teaspoonful of the volatile tincture of guiacum three\r\ntimes a day, in water. On the approach of the period, take the\r\nfollowing at night:\r\n\r\n    Calomel,              Three grains;\r\n    Opium,                One grain.\r\n\r\nIn the morning a dose of caster oil, and on the appearance of the\r\nmenses, the Dover's Powder and mixture as before. Repeat this\r\ntreatment, in each interval, until permanently relieved.\r\n\r\nThe following is recommended by an eminent physician, to be taken a\r\nfew days before the period:\r\n\r\n    Acetous tincture of colchicum,     Three drams;\r\n    Magnesia,                          One dram;\r\n    Sulphate of magnesia,              Three drams;\r\n    Distilled mint or cinnamon water,  Four ounces.\r\n\r\nMix. Dose: A small wineglassful every two or three hours until it\r\noperates. This should be preceded the night before by a small dose of\r\nblue pill.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SUPPRESSION OF THE MENSES--AMENORRHOEA.\r\n\r\nBy suppression is meant a disappearance of the menses after they have\r\nbecome established, and may be either acute or chronic. It is caused\r\nby cold caught during the flow, by exposure to night air or by wetting\r\nthe feet; fear, shocks, violent mental emotions, anxiety, fevers and\r\nother acute diseases. Chronic suppression may be either a consequence\r\nof the acute, or caused by delicate health; also, from diseases of the\r\novaries or womb. It may also be occasioned by an imperforate hymen, in\r\nwhich case it must be cut open by a physician.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nWhen the suppression is caused by some disease in the system, that\r\ndisease must be cured before the menses will return. For sudden\r\nsuppression, use the warm sitting-bath or foot bath. Apply cloths wet\r\nin warm water to the lower part of the abdomen, and drink freely of\r\nwarm water. If the suppression is chronic and the patient is delicate,\r\nin the interval between the menses use the shower or the full bath of\r\ncold or tepid water, rubbing the body briskly with a coarse towel,\r\nespecially around the abdomen, loins, and genital organs.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the discharge has ceased, a warm hip bath will generally\r\nbring it on. If there is much inflammation of the uterus give the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    Tincture aconite leaves,          Two drams;\r\n    Sweet spirits of nitre,           One ounce;\r\n    Simple syrup,                     Three ounces.\r\n\r\nDose: One teaspoonful every two or three hours.\r\n\r\nIf the discharge cannot be brought on, wait until the next period. A\r\nfew days before the term the bowels should be freely opened and kept\r\nopen until the period for the discharge has arrived. A pill of aloes\r\nand iron is one of the best that can be given. Give from one to three\r\npills daily. If there is no evident reason for the discharge not\r\nappearing, such as pregnancy, inflammation of the neck of the womb,\r\nand the woman is suffering from the suppression, use the following:\r\n\r\n    Caulophyllin,              One dram;\r\n    Extract aconite,           Eight grains;\r\n    Aloes,                     Ten grains;\r\n    Sulphate of iron,          Ten grains.\r\n\r\nMake into forty pills. Dose: Two or three pills, taken night and\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe remedies should always be taken a few days before the period\r\narrives for the menses. If the chronic suppression is the result of\r\nany acute disease, the health must first be re-established, otherwise\r\nit would be wrong to force the menses. When this has been done,\r\nimmediately before the return of the period a warm hip bath should be\r\ntaken every night for six nights, and one of the following pills taken\r\nthree times a day:\r\n\r\n    Fresh powdered ergot of rye,      Fifty grains;\r\n    Barbadoes aloes,                  Twelve grains;\r\n    Essential oil of juniper,         Twelve drops.\r\n\r\nMake into twelve pills with syrup or mucilage, washing down each pill\r\nwith a cupful of pennyroyal tea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                CESSATION OF THE MENSES--CHANGE OF LIFE.\r\n\r\nBy the phrase, \"change of life,\" or, the critical period, we\r\nunderstand the final cessation, or stoppage, of the menses. It usually\r\ntakes place between the ages of forty and fifty, although in some\r\ncases it may occur as early as thirty, and in others not until sixty.\r\nHowever, we can expect the change about the forty-fifth year.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms will vary according to the constitution of the woman. In\r\nsome the change occurs by the discharge gradually diminishing in\r\nquantity; in others, by the intervals between the periods being\r\nlengthened. A woman may pass this period without having any more\r\nunpleasant symptoms than an occasional rush of blood to the head, or a\r\nheadache. Others, however, may have very severe symptoms arise, which\r\nwill require the care of an intelligent physician. These disagreeable\r\nsensations should receive a careful consideration and not be hushed up\r\nwith the reply that these complaints arise from the \"change of life\"\r\nand will vanish whenever that change takes place. The foundation of\r\nserious trouble may be laid which will make the remainder of her\r\nexistence a burden and cut short a life which might have been\r\nconducted to a good old age. While this change is in progress, in\r\nprobably the majority of cases there is more or less disturbance of\r\nthe health. It is sometimes quite impossible to say exactly what is\r\nthe trouble with the patient, except that she is out of health. The\r\nfollowing are some of the symptoms which may arise: Headache,\r\ndizziness, biliousness, sour stomach, indigestion, diarrhoea, piles,\r\ncostiveness, itching of the private parts, cramp and colic of the\r\nbowels, palpitation of the heart, swelling of the limbs and abdomen,\r\npains in the back and loins, paleness and general weakness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nEat and drink moderately; sleep in airy, well-ventilated rooms;\r\nexercise daily in the open air, either by walking or riding; avoid\r\nviolent emotions; shun exposure to wet, stormy weather, wet feet, etc.\r\n\r\nKeep the bowels regulated with the following:\r\n\r\nMercurial pill, one grain; ipecac powder, one-half grain; compound\r\nrhubarb pill, three grains. Mix for a pill to be taken every night.\r\n\r\nOr, one ounce of hicra picra, or powdered aloes with castella, mixed\r\nin a pint of gin, which should stand for four or five days, after\r\nwhich a tablespoonful in a glass of water may be taken every morning\r\nor second morning, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nIf the patient is large and fleshy, of full habit, the following is\r\nrecommended:\r\n\r\nSulphate of magnesia, one and one-half ounces; compound infusion of\r\nroses, five ounces; cinnamon water, one ounce. Mix, Dose: Two\r\ntablespoonfuls once a day.\r\n\r\nIf there are nervous symptoms prominent, give valerianate of zinc,\r\neight grains; tincture of valerian, two drams; orange flower water,\r\nthree and a half ounces; syrup of red poppies, two drams. Mix. Dose: A\r\ntablespoonful every six hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FALLING OF THE WOMB\r\n\r\n                         _(Prolapsus uteri)._\r\n\r\nFalling of the womb is simply a sinking down of the organ, and may be\r\nso slight as not to be noticed or so great that the organ will\r\nprotrude between the legs through the external opening. It is not a\r\ndisease of the womb itself, but of some of its supports.\r\n\r\nSo long as the vagina retains its natural size and the ligaments are\r\nbut two and a half inches long the organ will not be displaced.\r\nWhatever tends to relax and weaken the system may cause the complaint.\r\nThe muscles of the abdomen which support the intestines being weakened\r\nfrom any cause will allow the intestines to press down upon the womb\r\nand its ligaments, and, in consequence of this constant pressure, they\r\ngive way. Another cause is too early exercise after childbearing.\r\nFlooding and leucorrhoea, or whites, if allowed to continue for a\r\nlong time, will produce it; in delicate females, continued running up\r\nand down stairs, also tight lacing, dancing, leaping, and running,\r\nparticularly during the period of menstruation, when the womb is\r\nincreased in weight by the blood contained in it. The use of medicines\r\nto loosen the bowels, which is very common among many, is still\r\nanother cause of the disorder.\r\n\r\nMost females who are troubled with falling of the womb think that it\r\nis necessary to a cure that they should wear some kind of a support to\r\nthe abdomen. These supporters, however, do a vast amount of harm, for\r\nby being worn tightly around the abdomen they increase the pressure on\r\nthe bowels, thus forcing down, more and more, the womb and its\r\nappendages. All that is necessary is to raise up the womb to its\r\nnatural position, and use an instrument that will keep it in place.\r\nThis instrument is called a pessary. This pessary is a ring or hollow\r\ncup-shaped globe, made of gold, silver, ivory, wood or gutta-percha,\r\nand is placed in the vagina or birthplace, thus supporting the womb.\r\nThe cold hip bath should be used once a day, at the same time\r\ninjecting cold water into the vagina with a syringe. Lie down as much\r\nas possible, and avoid becoming fatigued. Apply cold bandages to the\r\nabdomen on going to bed.\r\n\r\nIf the womb has descended to the external orifice it is often\r\nnecessary to restore it to its natural position by pressing it upward\r\nand backward by a finger or two pressed into the vagina. If the\r\nprocess be accompanied with pain, the vagina should be well washed by\r\ninjections of thick flax seed or slippery elm bark tea for a day or\r\ntwo before the astringent washes are used.\r\n\r\nAvoid tight corsets and heavy skirts, suspend the under-garments from\r\nthe shoulders and not from the waist, as is usually done. Use plain\r\nvegetable diet, and avoid tea, coffee, spirituous drinks, and all\r\nsensual indulgences. Allow the clothes to be loose. These things must\r\nbe attended to closely. The diet should be plain and nourishing, but\r\nnot stimulating.\r\n\r\nUse an injection of an infusion of white oak bark, geranium, or a\r\nsolution of alum, in the proportion of one ounce to the pint of water.\r\nIf there is inflammation of the womb, this must be subdued before\r\nusing the pessary. Give tincture of aconite, compound powder of ipecac\r\nand opium, with injections of an infusion of hops and lobelia, or an\r\ninfusion of belladonna.\r\n\r\nIf there is heat and difficulty in passing water, drink an infusion of\r\nmarsh mallow and spearmint. If the patient is weak, give the following\r\ntonic:\r\n\r\nSulphate quinine, twenty-five grains; citrate of iron (soluble),\r\nthirty-five grains. Make into twenty-four powders. Take a powder three\r\ntimes a day, after each meal, in sweet wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LEUCORRHOEA--WHITES--FLOUR ALBUS.\r\n\r\nThe word leucorrhoea is derived from two Greek words, and means\r\nliterally a \"white discharge.\" It is also known as \"flour albus,\"\r\n\"whites,\" and \"female weakness,\" and consists of a \"light colorless\r\ndischarge from the genital organs, varying in hue from a whitish or\r\ncolorless to a yellowish, light green, or to a slightly red or\r\nbrownish; varying in consistency from a thin, watery, to a thick,\r\ntenacious, ropy substance; and in quantity from a slight increase in\r\nthe healthy secretion to several ounces in the twenty-four hours.\"\r\nThis discharge generally occurs between the ages of fifteen and\r\nforty-five, seldom during infancy or old age. When it occurs in young\r\nfemale children, it will not infrequently be produced by the presence\r\nof pinworms in the vagina, which make their way there from the rectum.\r\nThere will be intense itching of the parts, and the worms can be\r\nremoved with a small piece of cloth, after separating the lips.\r\n\r\nThis disease may be either acute or chronic. The acute form generally\r\nresults from taking cold, and is simply a catarrhal inflammation of\r\nthe mucous membrane lining the vagina. The chronic form is but a\r\ncontinuation of the acute, and is generally caused by the acute stage\r\nhaving been neglected or improperly treated. Ulceration of the neck of\r\nthe womb sometimes results. There are two forms of leucorrhoea:\r\nVaginal leucorrhoea, when the discharge comes from the walls of the\r\nvagina; and cervical leucorrhoea, when the discharge proceeds from\r\nthe neck of the womb.\r\n\r\nCauses: Taking cold from sitting on the ground, or exposure of the\r\nneck and shoulders; over sexual excitement, and sexual intercourse;\r\ntight lacing; piles, miscarriages, and abortions; displacements of the\r\nwomb; purgatives, improper articles of diet; warm injections, or\r\ninjections of any kind; late hours, etc. It may also be hereditary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThe treatment, to be successful, requires that the patient should\r\nfirst be placed in a favorable condition. Anything which tends to\r\nexcite the disease must be avoided, as dissipations, late suppers,\r\netc. The diet must be plain and nourishing without being stimulating,\r\nand be taken regularly. Exercise, short of fatigue, will be\r\nbeneficial. The clothing should be warm and worn loosely, especially\r\nabout the waist. Water is of great importance in the treatment of this\r\ntrouble. The sitting-bath may be used every day, and injections of\r\ncold or tepid water should be used three or four times a day,\r\naccording to the severity of the discharge.\r\n\r\nAn injection of weak green tea will be found good in some mild cases,\r\nas also sweet cider or a weak solution of alum.\r\n\r\nOne of the best tonics is the muriated tincture of iron, of which take\r\ntwenty or twenty-five drops in half a tumbler of water three or four\r\ntimes a day. An excellent injection is made by taking three drams of\r\ntannic acid and an ounce of alum, dissolving in a quart of water, and\r\ninject one-third three times a day. The bowels should be kept open by\r\nRochelle or Epsom salts, or seidlitz powder. When there is great\r\ndebility of the organs, or when the disease has been brought on by\r\nexposure to cold, pregnancy, abortions, etc., the following will be\r\nfound very successful:\r\n\r\nTincture of aloes, two ounces; muriated tincture of iron, four drams.\r\nMix. Dose: Thirty-five drops in water three times a day. At the same\r\ntime use the following injection: Sulphate of zinc (white vitriol),\r\ntwo drams; sugar of lead, two drams. Mix in one quart of water, and\r\nuse one-fourth for each injection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n               COLLECTION OF VALUABLE MEDICAL COMPOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have--\r\n    A frequent headache over the eyes?\r\n    A susceptibility to chills and fever?\r\n    A bitter or oily taste in the mouth?\r\n    A sour stomach?\r\n    A complexion inclined to be yellow?\r\n    A great depression of spirits without known cause?\r\n    Specks before the eyes, and flushed face?\r\n    A done out, tired feeling?\r\n\r\nBesides many other symptoms too numerous to mention? If you have you\r\nare affected in your liver and kidneys, and should do something for\r\nit. The following preparation, \"Magic Kidney and Liver Restorer,\" acts\r\non these organs and, when diseased or out of order, restores them to a\r\nhealthy state.

JORDAN'S CHOLERA REMEDY.\r\n\r\nTake gum guaiac, prickly ash berries (or double as much bark of the\r\nroot), cloves, and cinnamon bark, of each two ounces; gum camphor and\r\ngum myrrh, of each one ounce; gum kino, half an ounce. Reduce all to a\r\ncoarse powder and add to one quart of best French brandy. Let it stand\r\nten days or two weeks to digest, shaking the bottle two or three times\r\na day to keep the ingredients from becoming impacted at the bottom;\r\nthen strain and press out, and then take oil anise and oil peppermint,\r\nof each two drams; alcohol, four ounces. Mix the oils and alcohol\r\ntogether in a bottle and shake well till they are cut, then add to the\r\nformer, and it is ready for use. Dose: From one to two teaspoonfuls\r\nevery five, ten, fifteen or thirty minutes, according to the urgency\r\nof the symptoms. In cholera it should be given frequently, and if\r\nthere are nausea and vomiting small doses are preferable; a single\r\nteaspoonful every five minutes till urgent symptoms are checked, then\r\ngive it less frequently. It should always be given alone, unmixed with\r\nanything else. In ordinary diarrhoea, one or two teaspoonfuls taken\r\nonce an hour will be sufficient. It is also an excellent remedy for\r\ncolic and pains in the stomach and bowels, and will generally settle\r\nthe stomach very soon in case of vomiting or nausea. It should always\r\nbe kept in the house. Where it is needed for immediate use, it may be\r\nmade in an hour or less by using alcohol instead of brandy and by\r\nboiling all in a stone jug, uncorked, by placing the jug in a vessel\r\nof boiling water, shaking or stirring frequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PILE OINTMENT.\r\n\r\nTake say a teacupful of hog's lard, put in a flat or pewter dish, and\r\ntake two bars of lead, flattened a little, and rub the lard with the\r\nflat ends and between them till it becomes black or of a dark lead\r\ncolor. Then burn equal parts of cavendish tobacco and old shoeleather\r\nin an iron vessel till charred. Powder these and mix into the lard\r\ntill it becomes a thick ointment. Use once or twice a day as an\r\nointment for the piles. An infallible cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WARTS AND CORNS.\r\n\r\nThe bark of the common willow burnt to ashes, mixed with strong\r\nvinegar and applied to the parts, will remove all warts, corns, and\r\nother excrescences.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DEAFNESS.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that the power of hearing once entirely lost can ever be\r\nrestored, and not always that even partial deafness can be cured,\r\nthough it may often be relieved. Partial deafness is frequently owing\r\nto the accumulation and hardening in the ear of the ear wax, which may\r\ngenerally be remedied by dropping into the ear such articles as are\r\ncalculated to soften, relax, and stimulate. For this purpose the\r\nfollowing preparations are recommended as the best:\r\n\r\nTake sulphuric ether, one ounce, and add to it one dram pulverized\r\ncarbonate of ammonia. Let it stand a few days to form a solution. If\r\nit does not all dissolve, pour off carefully the liquid from the\r\ndregs, and of this liquid drop into the ear once a day from three to\r\nsix drops. The patient should lay his head upon the opposite side at\r\nthe time, and remain in that position a few minutes to allow the\r\nliquid to penetrate. This preparation is highly recommended, and if\r\npersevered in will, it is said, overcome almost any partial deafness\r\nor greatly relieve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ANOTHER.\r\n\r\nTake pure olive oil, say one ounce, and half an ounce each of the\r\ntincture of lobelia and tincture of cayenne. Mix; and from a warm\r\nteaspoon drop into the ear four to six drops of this twice a day,\r\nshaking the vial well always before using it. This is relaxing,\r\nsoftening, and stimulating, and in all ordinary cases will answer the\r\npurpose. Turkey oil (or grease) is said to be still better than olive\r\noil and may be used instead of it in this preparation. The following\r\nremedy, long kept a secret, is said to be infallible where it is\r\npossible for anything to effect a cure:\r\n\r\nTake a common eel, remove the skin and intestines, and hang it up\r\nbefore the fire and let the oil drip into a pan or vessel. When done\r\ndripping, bottle the oil, and of this drop into the ear once a day or\r\ntwice a day five or six drops from a warm teaspoon. I have heard\r\nremarkable accounts of the efficacy of this remedy, and doubt not but\r\nit is good. I believe it has never been published but once before. The\r\nsecret was obtained with some difficulty from an old negro.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          INVERTED TOE-NAIL.\r\n\r\nThis is a very troublesome and often painful affection. The edges or\r\nsides of the nail are disposed to turn down and grow into the flesh,\r\ngiving rise to inflammation, ulceration, and often great pain and\r\nsuffering. The best remedy I have ever known in this difficulty is to\r\nscrape with some sharp-pointed instrument, as the point of a penknife,\r\na sort of groove or gutter in the center of the nail lengthways from\r\nthe root to the end. It must be scraped down to near the quick, or as\r\nthin as it can be borne. This renders the nail \"weak in the back,\" so\r\nthat it will gradually and ultimately turn up at the sides until the\r\nedges come above and over the flesh. Continue this as fast as the nail\r\ngrows out and grows thicker, and you will eventually succeed in\r\ngetting the nail in its proper shape and position. It will be proper\r\nto poultice if there is much inflammation, and also apply healing\r\nsalve. If ulceration, bathe the part also occasionally with tinctures\r\naloes, myrrh, and opium, equal parts mixed.--_Gunn's Domestic\r\nPhysician._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                       THINGS FOR THE SICK ROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people are ignorant of what constitutes good, nourishing,\r\nrefreshing food and drink for sick people. The following dishes are\r\nall palatable and nourishing, and are very refreshing to an invalid.\r\nEvery one should have these recipes for \"Things for the sick room\":\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BARLEY WATER.\r\n\r\nPearl barley, two ounces; boiling water, two quarts.

Balm,\r\npeppermint, spearmint, and other teas are made in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     A REFRESHING DRINK IN FEVERS.\r\n\r\nBoil one ounce and a half of tamarind, two ounces of stoned raisins,\r\nand three ounces of cranberries in three pints of water until two\r\npints remain. Strain, and add a small piece of fresh lemon peel, which\r\nmust be removed in half an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ARROWROOT JELLY.\r\n\r\nStir a tablespoonful of arrowroot powders into half a cupful of cold\r\nwater, pour in a pint of boiling water, let it stand five or ten\r\nminutes and then sweeten and flavor it to suit the taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           IRISH MOSS JELLY.\r\n\r\nIrish moss, half an ounce; fresh milk, one and a half pints.

Boil gently for an\r\nhour, or until it appears like a jelly. Add sugar, wine, and nutmeg,\r\nwith lemon juice to flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RICE JELLY.\r\n\r\nMix a quarter of a pound of rice, picked and washed, with half a pound\r\nof loaf sugar and just sufficient water to cover it. Boil until it\r\nassumes a jellylike appearance; strain, and season to suit the taste\r\nand condition of the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GRAPES.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of fever, very ripe grapes of any kind are a beneficial\r\narticle of diet, acting as both food and drink and possessing soothing\r\nand cooling qualities. They are also extremely grateful to every\r\npalate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TOAST.\r\n\r\nTo make a most excellent toast for a reduced or convalescent patient,\r\ntake bread twenty-four or thirty-six hours old, which has been made of\r\na mixture of fine wheat flour and Indian meal and a pure yeast batter\r\nmixed with eggs. Toast it until of a delicate brown, and then (if the\r\npatient be not inclined to fever) immerse it in boiled milk and\r\nbutter. If the patient be feverish, spread it lightly with cranberry\r\njam or calves' foot jelly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 RICE.\r\n\r\nIn all cases where a light and nice diet for patients who have been or\r\nare afflicted with diarrhoea or dysentery is required, rice, in\r\nalmost any cooked form, is most agreeable and advantageous. It may be\r\ngiven with benefit to dyspeptics, unless costiveness accompanies the\r\ndyspepsia. To make rice pudding, take a teacupful of rice, and as much\r\nsugar, two quarts of milk, and a teaspoonful of salt. Bake, with a\r\nmoderate heat, for two hours. Rice flour made in a batter and baked\r\nupon a griddle makes a superb cake; and rice-flour gruel, seasoned to\r\nthe taste, is most excellent for the sick room.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BREAD JELLY.\r\n\r\nBoil a quart of water and let it cool. Take one-third of a common loaf\r\nof wheat bread, slice it, pare off the crust, and toast it to a light\r\nbrown. Put it in water in a covered vessel and boil gently till you\r\nfind, on putting some in a spoon to cool, the liquid has become a\r\njelly. Strain and cool. When used, warm a cupful, sweeten with sugar,\r\nand add a little grated lemon peel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RICE GRUEL.\r\n\r\nGround rice, one heaping tablespoonful; water, one quart. Boil gently\r\nfor twenty minutes, adding, a few minutes before it is done, one\r\ntablespoonful of ground cinnamon. Strain and sweeten. Wine may be\r\nadded when the case demands it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             WATER GRUEL.\r\n\r\nOat or corn meal, two tablespoonfuls; water, one quart. Boil for ten\r\nminutes and strain, adding salt and sugar if desired by the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SAGO GRUEL.\r\n\r\nSago, two tablespoonfuls; water, one pint. Boil gently until it\r\nthickens; stir frequently. May add wine, sugar, and nutmeg, according\r\nto taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ARROWROOT GRUEL.\r\n\r\nArrowroot, one tablespoonful; sweet milk and boiling water, each one\r\nhalf pint. Sweeten with loaf sugar. This is very good for children\r\nwhose bowels are irritable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TAPIOCA.\r\n\r\nTapioca is a very delightful food for invalids. Make an ordinary\r\npudding of it, and improve the flavor agreeably to the desire of the\r\npatient or convalescent by adding raisins, sugar, prunes, lemon juice,\r\nwine, spices, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BEEF LIQUID.\r\n\r\nWhen the stomach is very weak, take fresh lean beef, cut it into\r\nstrips and place the strips into a bottle with a little salt; place in\r\na kettle of boiling water and let it remain one hour; pour off the\r\nliquid and add some water. Begin with a small quantity, and use in the\r\nsame manner and under similar circumstances as beef tea. This is even\r\nmore nourishing than beef tea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BEEF TEA.\r\n\r\nCut one pound of lean beef into shreds, and boil for twenty minutes in\r\none quart of water, being particular to remove the scum as often as\r\nany rises. When it is cool, strain. This is very nourishing and\r\npalatable, and is of great value in all cases of extreme debility\r\nwhere no inflammatory action exists, or after the inflammation is\r\nsubdued. In very low cases a small teaspoonful may be administered\r\nevery fifteen or twenty minutes, gradually increasing the amount given\r\nas the powers of life return. In cases of complete prostration, after\r\nthe cessation of long exhausting fever it may be used as directed\r\nabove, either alone or in conjunction with a little wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PANADO.\r\n\r\nPut a little water on the fire, with a glass of wine, some sugar, and\r\na little grated nutmeg; boil all together a few seconds, and add\r\npounded cracker or crumbs of bread, and boil again for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FRENCH MILK PORRIDGE.\r\n\r\nStir some oatmeal and water together; let the mixture stand to clear,\r\nand pour off the water. Then put more water to the meal; stir it well,\r\nand let it stand till the next day. Strain through a fine sieve, and\r\nboil the water, adding milk while so doing. The proportion of water\r\nmust be small. With toast this is admirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             COFFEE MILK.\r\n\r\nPut a dessertspoonful of ground coffee into a pint of milk; boil a\r\nquarter of an hour, with a shaving or two of isinglass; let it stand\r\nten minutes, and then pour off.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          RESTORATIVE JELLY.\r\n\r\nTake a leg of well-fed pork just as cut up, beat it and break the\r\nbone; set it over a gentle fire, with three gallons of water and\r\nsimmer to one. Let half an ounce of mace and the same of nutmeg stew\r\nin it. Strain through a fine sieve. When cold, take off the fat. Give\r\na coffee cup of this three times a day, adding salt to the taste. This\r\nis very valuable in all cases of debility where animal food is\r\nadmissible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DRINK IN DYSENTERY.\r\n\r\nSheep's suet, two ounces; milk, one pint; starch, half an ounce. Boil\r\ngently for thirty minutes. Use as a common drink. This is excellent\r\nfor sustaining the strength in bad cases of dysentery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CRUST COFFEE.\r\n\r\nToast slowly a thick piece of bread cut from the outside of a loaf\r\nuntil it is well browned, but not blackened; then turn upon it boiling\r\nwater of a sufficient quantity, and keep it from half an hour to an\r\nhour before using. Be sure that the liquid is of a rich brown color\r\nbefore you use it. It is a most excellent drink in all cases of\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CRANBERRY WATER.\r\n\r\nPut a teaspoonful of cranberries into a cup of water and mash them. In\r\nthe meantime boil two quarts of water with one large spoonful of corn\r\nor oat meal and a bit of lemon peel; then add the cranberries and as\r\nmuch fine sugar as will leave a smart flavor of the fruit; also a\r\nwineglassful of sherry. Boil the whole gently for a quarter of an\r\nhour, then strain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              WINE WHEY.\r\n\r\nHeat a pint of new milk until it boils, at which moment pour in as\r\nmuch good wine as will curdle and clarify it. Boil and set it aside\r\nuntil the curd subsides. Do not stir it, but pour the whey off\r\ncarefully, and add two pints of boiling water with loaf sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ORANGE WHEY.\r\n\r\nMilk, one pint; the juice of an orange with a portion of the peel.\r\nBoil the milk, then put the orange into it and let it stand till it\r\ncoagulates. Strain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MUSTARD WHEY.\r\n\r\nBruised mustard seed, two tablespoonfuls; milk, one quart. Boil\r\ntogether for a few minutes until it coagulates, and strain to separate\r\nthe curd. This is a very useful drink in dropsy. A teacupful may be\r\ntaken at a dose, three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHICKEN BROTH.\r\n\r\nTake half a chicken, divested of all fat, and break the bones; add to\r\nthis half a gallon of water, and boil for half an hour. Season with\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VEGETABLE SOUP.\r\n\r\nTake one potato, one turnip and one onion, with a little celery or\r\ncelery seed. Slice, and boil for an hour in one quart of water. Salt\r\nto the taste, and pour the whole upon a piece of dry toast. This forms\r\na good substitute for animal food and may be used when the latter\r\nwould be improper.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CALVES'-FOOT JELLY.\r\n\r\nBoil two calf's feet in one gallon of water until reduced to one\r\nquart. Strain, and when cool skim carefully. Add the white of six or\r\neight eggs, well beaten; a pint of wine, half a pound of loaf sugar,\r\nand the juice of four lemons. Mix them well, boil for a few minutes,\r\nstirring constantly, and pass through a flannel strainer. In some\r\ncases the wine should be omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SLIPPERY ELM JELLY.\r\n\r\nTake of the flour of slippery elm, one or two tablespoonfuls; cold\r\nwater, one pint. Stir until a jelly is formed. Sweeten with loaf sugar\r\nor honey. This is excellent for all diseases of the throat, chest, and\r\nlungs; coughs, colds, bronchitis, inflammation of the lungs, etc. It\r\nis very nutritious and soothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NUTRITIVE FLUIDS.\r\n\r\nFollowing will be found directions for preparing three nutritious\r\nfluids, which are of great value in all diseases, either acute or\r\nchronic, that are attended or followed by prostration; debility,\r\nwhether general or of certain organs only; derangement of the\r\ndigestive organs, weak stomach, indigestion, heartburn or sour\r\nstomach, constipated bowels, torpidity or want of activity of the\r\nliver, thin or poor blood. These fluids are highly nutritious,\r\nsupplying to the blood, in such a form that they are most easily\r\nassimilated, the various elements which are needed to enrich it and\r\nthus enable it to reproduce the various tissues of the body that have\r\nbeen wasted by disease. In cases where the stomach has become so\r\nweakened and sensitive that the lightest food or drinks cannot be\r\ntaken without causing much uneasiness and distress these fluids are\r\ninvaluable. They strengthen the stomach and neutralize all undue\r\nacidity, while at the same time they soothe the irritation by their\r\nbland and demulcent qualities. When carefully and properly prepared,\r\naccording to the directions following, they very nearly resemble rich\r\nnew milk in color and consistency, while their taste is remarkably\r\npleasant. Care should be taken that all the ingredients are of the\r\nbest quality. Soft water must be used in all cases. Fresh rain water\r\nis to be preferred, but spring water may be used if perfectly soft.\r\nHard water will cause the fluids to be of a yellow color, and if the\r\nmilk is old they are apt to separate:\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FLUID NO. 1.\r\n\r\nPut a pint of new milk (the fresher the better) and two pints of soft\r\nwater, in a vessel perfectly free from all greasy matter, over a slow\r\nfire. Rub two even teaspoonfuls of superfine wheat flour and two\r\nteaspoonfuls of carbonate of magnesia, together with a little milk,\r\ninto a soft batter, free from lumps; add this to the milk and water as\r\nsoon as they begin to boil. Boil gently for five minutes--_no\r\nlonger_--stirring constantly. Pour into an earthen or glass dish to\r\ncool, adding at the same time two teaspoonfuls of loaf sugar and one\r\nteaspoonful each of saleratus and table salt, rubbed fine. Stir until\r\ncold. The fluid must not be allowed to remain in a metallic vessel of\r\nany kind, and it must be kept in a cool place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FLUID NO. 2.\r\n\r\nPut one pint of fresh milk and two pints of soft water in a vessel\r\nover a slow fire. Rub together with a little fresh cream into a soft\r\nbatter, free from lumps, one tablespoonful each of good sweet rye\r\nflour, ground rice, and pure starch; which add to the milk and water\r\nas soon as they begin to boil. Boil for five minutes, stirring\r\nconstantly. Remove from the fire and add three teaspoonfuls of loaf\r\nsugar and one teaspoonful each of saleratus and table salt. Observe\r\nthe same precautions as in No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FLUID NO. 3.\r\n\r\nPut in a vessel, over a slow fire, one pint of fresh milk and two\r\npints of soft water. When they begin to boil, add one tablespoonful of\r\nwheat flour, two tablespoonfuls of pure starch, and two teaspoonfuls\r\nof carbonate of magnesia, rubbed, together with a little milk into a\r\nsoft batter, free from lumps. Boil gently for five minutes, stirring\r\nconstantly. Pour into an earthen vessel to cool, and add one\r\nteaspoonful of the best gum arabic dissolved in a little warm water,\r\none teaspoonful each of saleratus and table salt, and one\r\ntablespoonful of pure strained honey. Stir until cold. The same\r\nprecaution must be observed as in preparing No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DIRECTIONS.\r\n\r\nOne half pint or less of these fluids may be taken at a dose, and at\r\nleast three pints should be taken during the day and the amount\r\ngradually increased to two or three quarts. Commence with No. 1 and\r\nuse two weeks, then use No. 2 for the same length of time, after which\r\nNo. 3 is to be used for two weeks. Continue their use as long as\r\nnecessary, taking each for two weeks before changing. In all the\r\ndiseases mentioned above, the use of these fluids, in connection with\r\nproper remedies, will insure a speedy restoration to health.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GUM ACACIA RESTORATIVE.\r\n\r\nTake two ounces of pure white gum arabic (procure the lump, the\r\npowdered is very apt to be adulterated), pulverize it well, and\r\ndissolve by the aid of a gentle heat in a gill of water, stirring\r\nconstantly. When it is entirely dissolved, add three tablespoonfuls of\r\npure strained honey. Let it remain over the fire until it becomes of\r\nthe consistency of a jelly. The heat must be very gentle, it must not\r\nboil. If desirable, flavor with lemon or vanilla. This will be found a\r\nvery pleasant article of diet for a weak stomach. When the articles\r\nused are pure it will be transparent and of a light golden color. This\r\nwill be borne by the weakest stomach when everything else is rejected.\r\n_It is highly nutritious._\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MALT INFUSION.\r\n\r\nInfuse one pint of ground malt for two hours in three pints of\r\nscalding water. The water should not be brought quite to the boiling\r\npoint. Strain; add sugar, if desired; flavor with lemon juice. This is\r\nan excellent drink in inflammatory fevers, acute rheumatism, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PEAS.\r\n\r\nTake young and fresh shelled green peas, wash them clean, put them\r\ninto fresh water, just enough to cover them, and boil them till they\r\ntake up nearly all the water. This dish, if prepared according to\r\ndirections, and eaten warm, will not harm any invalid, not even one\r\nsuffering from diarrhoea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 MILK.\r\n\r\nIn some cases where a milk diet is advisable, owing to the peculiar\r\ncondition of the patient's stomach it will cause distress. This is\r\nfrequently the case where there is undue acidity. In such cases, let\r\nit be prepared in the following manner and it will be found to set\r\nwell: Take a teacupful of fresh milk, heat nearly to boiling; dissolve\r\nin it a teaspoonful of loaf sugar; pour into a large sized tumbler,\r\nand add sufficient plain soda water to fill it. Prepared in the above\r\ndirected manner it will be free from all unpleasant effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SOUPS FOR THE CONVALESCENT.\r\n\r\nTo extract the strength from meat, long and slow boiling is necessary;\r\nbut care must be taken that the pot is never off the boil. All soups\r\nshould be made the day before they are used, and they should then be\r\nstrained into earthen pans. When soup has jellied in the pan, it\r\nshould not be removed into another. When in danger of not keeping, it\r\nshould be boiled up.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 EGGS.\r\n\r\nIn cases of extreme debility, eggs are most excellent. They should\r\nnever be boiled hard. The best way to prepare them is to beat them\r\nwell with milk and sugar. When it will be appropriate to the case, add\r\nsome fine pale sherry wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MILK FOR INFANTS.\r\n\r\nFresh cow's milk, one part; water, two parts; sweeten with a very\r\nlittle loaf sugar. When children are raised by hand it is always\r\nnecessary to dilute the milk. As the child advances in age the\r\nproportion of water stated above may be gradually lessened.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             WATER GRUEL.\r\n\r\nCorn or oat meal, two tablespoonfuls; water, one quart. Boil ten or\r\nfifteen minutes, and strain. Add salt and sugar to suit the taste of\r\nthe patient. This should be used freely during and after the operation\r\nof cathartic medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                      THINGS CURIOUS AND USEFUL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      TO GET CLEAR OF MOSQUITOES.\r\n\r\nTake of gum camphor a piece about one-third the size of an egg and\r\nevaporate it over a lamp or candle, taking care that it does not\r\nignite. The smoke will soon fill the room and expel the mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      HOW TO GET RID OF BEDBUGS.\r\n\r\nBedbugs cannot stand hot alum water; indeed, alum seems to be death to\r\nthem in any form. Take two pounds of alum, reduce it to a powder--the\r\nfiner the better--and dissolve it in about four quarts of boiling\r\nwater. Keep the water hot till the alum is all dissolved; then apply\r\nit hot to every joint, crevice and place about the bedstead, floor,\r\nskirting or washboard around the room, and every place where the bugs\r\nare likely to congregate, by means of a brush. A common syringe is an\r\nexcellent thing to use in applying it to the bedstead. Apply the water\r\nas hot as you can. Apply it freely, and you will hardly be troubled\r\nany more that season with bugs. Whitewash the ceiling with plenty of\r\ndissolved alum in the wash, and there will be an end to their dropping\r\ndown from thence on to your bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n               TO OBTAIN FRESH-BLOWN FLOWERS IN WINTER.\r\n\r\nChoose some of the most perfect buds of the flowers you would\r\npreserve, such as are latest in blowing and ready to open. Cut them\r\noff with a pair off scissors, leaving to each, if possible, apiece of\r\nstem about three inches long. Cover the end of the stem immediately\r\nwith sealing wax, and when the buds are a little shrunk and wrinkled\r\nwrap up each of them separately in a piece of paper perfectly clean\r\nand dry and lock them up in a dry box or drawer, and they will keep\r\nwithout corrupting.\r\n\r\nIn winter or at any time when you would have the flowers blow, take\r\nthe buds at night and cut off the end of the stem sealed with wax and\r\nput the buds in water wherein a little nitre or salt has been\r\ndiffused, and the next day you will have the pleasure of seeing the\r\nbuds opening and expanding themselves and the flowers display their\r\nmost lively colors and breathe their agreeable odors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                TO INCREASE THE LAYING OF EGGS IN HENS.\r\n\r\nPulverized Cayenne pepper, half an ounce, to be given to one dozen\r\nhens, mixed with their food every second day.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE NEW AND BEAUTIFUL ART OF TRANSFERRING ON TO GLASS.\r\n\r\nColored or plain engravings, photographs, lithographs, water colors,\r\noil colors, crayons, steel plates, newspaper cuts, mezzotints, pencil,\r\nwriting, show cards, labels, or, in fact, anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DIRECTIONS.\r\n\r\nTake glass that is perfectly clear (window glass will answer), clean\r\nit thoroughly; then varnish it, taking care to have it perfectly\r\nsmooth; place it where it will be perfectly free from dust; let it\r\nstand over night, then take your engraving, lay it in clear water\r\nuntil it is wet through (say ten or fifteen minutes), then lay it upon\r\na newspaper, that the moisture may dry from the surface and still keep\r\nthe other side damp. Immediately varnish your glass the second time,\r\nthen place your engraving upon it, pressing it down firmly, so as to\r\nexclude every particle of air; next, rub the paper from the back until\r\nit is of uniform thickness, so thin that you can see through it, then\r\nvarnish it the third time and let it dry.\r\n\r\nThese transferred pictures make lovely ornaments for table, bracket,\r\nmantel, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   MATERIALS FOR MAKING THE VARNISH.\r\n\r\nTake two ounces balsam of fir to one ounce spirits of turpentine.\r\nApply with a camel's-hair brush.\r\n\r\n\r\n               TO PREVENT HORSES BEING TEASED BY FLIES.\r\n\r\nBoil three handfuls of walnut leaves in three quarts of water; sponge\r\nthe horse (before going out of the stable) between and upon the ears,\r\nneck, and flank.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 TO PREVENT FLIES LIGHTING ON WINDOWS,\r\n                        PICTURES, MIRRORS, ETC.\r\n\r\nNo fly will light on a window or other article which has been washed\r\nin water in which garlic has been boiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     TO MAKE LEATHER WEAR FOREVER.\r\n\r\nLet it receive as much neat's-foot oil as it will take. If regularly\r\nrepeated every three months, leather so treated seems to be impervious\r\nto outward action and will last for years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      TO RENDER PAPER FIREPROOF.\r\n\r\nWhether the paper be plain, written, printed, or even marbled,\r\nstained, or painted for paper hangings, dip it in a strong solution of\r\nalum water and thoroughly dry it. In this state it will be fireproof.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     TO PREPARE WATERPROOF BOOTS.\r\n\r\nTake three ounces of spermaceti and melt it in an earthen pot over a\r\nslow fire; add thereto six drains of India rubber cut into slices, and\r\nafter it dissolves add of tallow, eight ounces; amber varnish, four\r\nounces. Mix it, and it will be ready for use immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO CURE DRUNKENNESS.\r\n\r\nKeep the patient for one week freely dosed with figwort. This is a\r\nsure cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TO CURE LAZINESS.\r\n\r\nGive the patient an occasional dose of ferri. The sulphate of ferri is\r\nthe best. It acts on the liver and vital organs, and is a sure cure\r\nfor laziness.\r\n\r\n\r\n             TO EXTRACT THE ESSENTIAL OIL FROM ANY FLOWER.\r\n\r\nTake any flower you like, which stratify with common salt in a clean\r\nglazed pot; when filled to the top, cover it well and carry it to the\r\ncellar; forty days afterwards put a crape over a pan and empty the\r\nwhole to strain the essence from the flowers by pressure. Bottle this\r\nessence, and expose it for four or five weeks in the sun and dew of\r\nthe evening to purify. One single drop of this essence is enough to\r\nscent a whole quart of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TO TAKE LEAF PHOTOGRAPHS.\r\n\r\nA very pretty amusement, especially for those who have just completed\r\nthe study of botany, is the taking of leaf photographs. One very\r\nsimple process is this: At any druggist's get an ounce of bichromate\r\nof potassium. Put this into a pint bottle of water. When the solution\r\nbecomes saturated--that is, the water has dissolved as much as it\r\nwill--pour off some of the clear liquid into a shallow dish; on this\r\nfloat a piece of ordinary writing paper till it is thoroughly\r\nmoistened, and let it dry in the dark. It should be of a bright yellow\r\ncolor. On this put the leaf, under it a piece of black soft cloth and\r\nseveral sheets of newspaper. Put these between two pieces of glass\r\n(all the pieces should be of the same size) and with spring\r\nclothespins fasten them together. Expose to a bright sun, placing the\r\nleaf so that the rays will fall upon it as nearly perpendicular as\r\npossible. In a few moments it will begin to turn brown; but it\r\nrequires from half an hour to several hours to produce a perfect\r\nprint. When it has become dark enough, take it from the frame and put\r\nit into clear water, which must be changed every few minutes until the\r\nyellow part becomes white. Sometimes the veinings will be quite\r\ndistinct. By following these directions it is scarcely possible to\r\nfail, and a little practice will make perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  TO MAKE LAMP WICKS INDESTRUCTIBLE.\r\n\r\nSteep common wicks in a concentrated aqueous solution of tungstate of\r\nsoda, and then dry thoroughly in an oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 TO MAKE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PERFUMES.\r\n\r\n                      BALM OF A THOUSAND FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nDeodorized alcohol, one pint; nice white bar soap, four ounces. Shave\r\nthe soap when put in; stand in a warm place till dissolved; then add\r\noil of citronella, one dram, and oils of neroli and rosemary, of each\r\none-half dram.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FRANGAPANNI.\r\n\r\nSpirits, one gallon; oil of bergamot, one ounce; oil of lemon, one\r\nounce: Macerate for four days, frequently shaking; then add water, one\r\ngallon; orange flower water, one pint; essence of vanilla, two ounces.\r\nMix.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOCKEY CLUB.\r\n\r\nSpirits of wine, five gallons; orange flower water, one gallon; balsam\r\nof Peru, four ounces; essence of bergamot, eight ounces; essence of\r\nmusk, eight ounces; essence of cloves, four ounces; essence of neroli,\r\ntwo ounces.

Mix.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to make a small quantity of any of the above perfumes, use\r\nsmall quantities of the ingredients, preserving the same proportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TO WRITE SECRET LETTERS.\r\n\r\nPut five cents' worth of citrate of potassa in an ounce vial of clear\r\ncold water. This forms an invisible fluid. Let it dissolve, and you\r\ncan use on paper of any color. Use goose quill in writing. When you\r\nwish the writing to become visible, hold it to a red-hot stove.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   TO PRESERVE FLOWERS SO THAT THEIR\r\n                      BEAUTY WILL LAST FOR YEARS.\r\n\r\nMake a strong solution of gum arabic, two ounces of the gum to one\r\npint of boiling water; shake until dissolved; then take your flowers\r\nand immerse in the solution, taking care that every part is well wet\r\nwith the solution.

Flowers treated thus will last for years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                           HOME DECORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief features to be observed in house furnishing are color, form,\r\nand proportion. All stiffness of design in furniture should be\r\navoided. Do not attempt to match articles, but rather carry out the\r\nsame idea as to color and form in the whole. It is not _en regle_ to\r\nhave decorations in sets or pairs; the arrangements should all be done\r\nwith odd pieces. Every room in the house should be arranged for\r\noccupancy, having nothing too good for use, and the judicious\r\nhousewife will follow a medium course and adopt no extreme of fashion.\r\n\r\nThe style and arrangement of the furniture should correspond with the\r\nsize of the room, with a due regard to the place a piece of furniture\r\nor ornament will occupy. The order of arrangement in furnishing is\r\nsubject to individual taste, but the following suggestions may not be\r\ninappropriate:--\r\n\r\nIn decorating a dining-room, deep, rich tones should be used; a\r\ndrawingroom or parlor should have bright, cheerful shades; in a\r\nlibrary use deep, rich colors, which give a sense of worth; a\r\nsleeping-room should have light, pleasing tints, which give a feeling\r\nof repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE HALL.\r\n\r\nThe hall being the index to the whole house, due care should therefore\r\nbe given to its furnishing. Light colors and gilding should be\r\navoided. The wall and ceiling decorations now mostly used are in dark,\r\nrich colors, shaded in maroons or deep reds. Plain tinted walls and\r\nceilings in fresco or wainscot are also frequently used. The latest\r\nshades of wall paper come in wood colors, dark olive-greens, stone\r\ncolor, and grays, in tile, arabesque and landscape designs, and with\r\nthese are used a corresponding dado and frieze.\r\n\r\nA tile or inlaid floor is the most appropriate, but if circumstances\r\ndo not admit of one of these, a floor stained a deep wood-brown, base\r\nboard and moldings to correspond, may be substituted; when India\r\nmattings and rugs may be used.\r\n\r\nThe colors now in vogue for hall carpets are crimson or Pompeiian\r\nreds, with small figures of moss-green or peacock-blue. The prevailing\r\nshades of the walls and floor should be incorporated in the stair\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\nIf the hall is narrow, none but the most essential pieces of furniture\r\nshould be used; but if wide enough, there may be a lounge placed\r\nagainst one of the walls, an old-fashioned clock of the cuckoo style\r\nset in a quiet corner, two high-backed chairs upholstered in leather,\r\na table, an umbrella-stand placed near the door, a jardiniere filled\r\nwith tropical plants set near the foot of the stairway, and a hall\r\nmirror with a deer's head and antlers placed above it and a wooden or\r\nmarble slab underneath. The slab should be covered with a Roman scarf,\r\nallowing a fall of twelve inches at each end. The hatrack must also\r\nfind a place. Family portraits or a few well-selected pictures are\r\nappropriate for these walls.\r\n\r\nIf the door-lights are not stained glass, lace shades in designs of\r\nbirds, cupids, and garlands of flowers are used; also, etchings in\r\nvarious colors and designs are worked on different fabrics. Crimson\r\nsilk shades lined with black netting are very desirable, as the light\r\npenetrating through them fills the hall with a rich, subdued glow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PARLOR.\r\n\r\nThe furnishing of the parlor should be subject to its architectural\r\nfinish. The first things to be considered are the walls and floor. The\r\nformer may be decorated in fresco or papered, according to individual\r\ntaste and means. The prettiest styles of parlor paper are light tints\r\nof gray, olive, pearl, and lavender grounds, and in small scroll\r\npatterns, panels, birds, and vines, finished in heavy gold traceries,\r\nwith dado and frieze to correspond.\r\n\r\nThe styles of carpet mostly used are Brussels, Wilton, tapestry, and\r\nAxminster. A tapestry carpet in light canary ground, with clusters of\r\nlotus, or begonia leaves, makes a charming background to almost all\r\nthe colors generally used in upholstery.\r\n\r\nIn selecting the furniture, the first thought should be given to its\r\ntrue worth. Chairs and couches should be chosen for comfort rather\r\nthan for style. They should be of solid make, easy, graceful, and of\r\ngood, serviceable colors and materials. The most serviceable woods to\r\nselect in frames are ebony, oak, walnut, cherry, and mahogany. These\r\nframes are finished in different styles--plain, carved, inlaid, and\r\ngilt--and are upholstered in all shades of satin, plush, rep, silk,\r\nand damask. These come at prices within the means of a slender purse.\r\nThat slippery abomination in the shape of haircloth furniture should\r\nbe avoided. The latest design in parlor furniture is in the Turkish\r\nstyle, the upholstery being made to cover the frame. Rich Oriental\r\ncolors in woolen and silk brocades are mostly used, and the trimmings\r\nare cord and tassels or heavy fringe.\r\n\r\nFormerly the parlor appointments were all in sets or pairs, but this\r\nfashion is no longer observed, as the most tastefully arranged parlor\r\nhas now no two pieces of furniture alike; but two easy-chairs placed\r\nopposite each other are never out of place. Here may stand an\r\nembroidered ottoman, there a quaint little chair, a divan can take\r\nsome central position; a cottage piano, covered with some embroidered\r\ndrapery, may stand at one end of the room, while an ebony or mahogany\r\ncabinet, with its panel mirrors and quaint brasses, may be placed at\r\nthe other end, its racks and shelves affording an elegant display for\r\npretty pieces of bric-a-brac.\r\n\r\nMarble-topped center-tables are no longer in use. Tables in inlaid\r\nwoods, or hand-painted, are used for placing books or albums on. A\r\nsmall, airy-looking table, elaborately mounted in gilt, may stand near\r\na window or wall. The mantel mirror, with its beveled edges and small\r\nracks arranged on each side, looks very effective when decorated with\r\npretty oddities--ferns, grasses, and pieces of old china. A jardiniere\r\nfilled with living plants and placed near a bay window makes an\r\nelegant ornament. Care should be taken in arranging that the room be\r\nnot over-crowded. There should be a few good pictures or painted\r\nplaques mounted in plush hung on the walls; a portrait may be placed\r\non a common easel and draped with a scarf in old gold or peacock-blue,\r\nand tiny lambrequins, painted or embroidered, may hang beneath a\r\nbracket supporting a bust or flower-vase.\r\n\r\nAn embroidered scarf with fringed ends may be placed on the back of a\r\nchair or sofa in place of the old lace tidy. A sack made of small\r\npieces of bright-colored plush or silk in crazy work may be flung\r\nacross the table, the ends drooping very low. The mantelpiece may be\r\ncovered with a corresponding sash, over which place a small clock as\r\ncenterpiece and arrange ornaments on each side--statuettes, bannerets,\r\nflower-holders, small Japanese fans, pieces of odd china, painted\r\ncandles in small scenes, may all find a place on the mantel.\r\n\r\nWindow curtains of heavy fabric, hung from brass or plush mounted\r\npoles, may be gracefully draped to the sides, while the inner lace\r\nones should be hung straight and be fastened in the center with some\r\nornament or bow of ribbon corresponding in shade to the general tone\r\nof the room. The straight shades next to the glass may correspond in\r\ntone to the outside walls or window-facings; but this is a mere matter\r\nof taste. White or light-tinted shades, finished in etching or narrow\r\nlace, are always in vogue.\r\n\r\nThe dado shades are the latest innovation in window decoration. These\r\ncome in all colors, from the lightest to the darkest shades, with dado\r\nin tile, arabesque and fresco patterns, finished in lace, fringe, and\r\nbrasses.\r\n\r\nPortieres (curtain doors) have superseded folding doors. These should\r\nbe in shades to contrast with the general blending of the colors in\r\nthe room. The fabrics mostly used are India goods, but they may be of\r\nany material, from expensive tapestries, satins, and plushes, to\r\nten-cent factory cottons. The curtains, if made from striped tapestry\r\nand Turcoman, will give the finishing artistic touches to almost any\r\nroom, but the last softening polish comes only from the genial\r\npresence of trailing and climbing vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE SITTING-ROOM.\r\n\r\nThe sitting or everyday room should be the brightest and most\r\nattractive room in the house. Its beauty of decoration should not be\r\nso much in the richness and variety of material as in its comfort,\r\nsimplicity, and the harmony of its tints--the main features being the\r\nfitness of each article to the needs of the room. In these days of so\r\nmany advantages much can be done in adornment by simple means.\r\n\r\nThe wall papers mostly used come in grounds of cream, amber, rose,\r\npale olive, fawn, ceil blue and light gray, with designs and traceries\r\nof contrasting hues.\r\n\r\nThe carpet, if in tapestry, looks more effective if in grounds of pale\r\ncanary or light gray, with designs in bright-colored woodland flowers\r\nand borders to match. The new ingrain carpets, with their pretty\r\ndesigns and bright colors, are very fashionable for rooms that are\r\nmuch used.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the prevailing tint of the carpet, the window curtains\r\nshould follow it up in lighter tones or contrast with it. The curtains\r\nmay correspond with the coverings of the chairs, sofa, mantel and\r\ntable draperies in color and fabric. If the furniture is of wicker,\r\nbamboo or rattan, the curtains should be of Japanese or any kind of\r\nOriental goods. Curtains of muslin (either white or tinted),\r\ngay-colored chintzes, lace or dotted Swiss muslin, looped back with\r\nbright-toned ribbons, look very pretty and are appropriate for the\r\nsitting-room at almost any season. That clumsy structure called the\r\ncornice, for putting up curtains on, has happily given place to the\r\nmore light and graceful curtain pole.\r\n\r\nOne large table, covered with a pretty embroidered cloth, should be\r\nplaced in some central location for a catch-all. A low divan, with a\r\npair of square, soft pillows, may stand in some quiet nook; a rocker,\r\nhandsomely upholstered, with a pretty tidy pinned to its back; a\r\nlarge, soft easy-chair; a small sewing-chair placed near a table; and\r\na bamboo chair, trimmed with ribbons, will be tastefully arranged in\r\nthe room. Window stands and gypsy tables may be draped with some rich\r\nfabric, the surrounding valance being caught up in small festoons and\r\nfastened with bows or tassels, finished around the edge of the table\r\nwith cord or quilted ribbon.\r\n\r\nIf the furniture is old or in sets it can be covered with different\r\npatterns in cretonne or chintz, which not only protects the furniture\r\nbut breaks up the monotony and lends a pleasing variety to the room. A\r\nTurkish chair is a grand accessory to the family room. This may be\r\nmade by buying the frame and having it upholstered in white cotton\r\ncloth and covering it with a rich shade of cretonne, finishing it with\r\ncord and fringe.\r\n\r\nA foot-rest frame can be made in the same way and covered with a piece\r\nof homemade embroidery, finishing it off with a cord or narrow gimp\r\naround the edge. Homemade easels, screens, and pedestals may be made\r\nout of black walnut, and when stained and draped look exceedingly\r\npretty. An old second-hand cabinet may be bought at a trifle, and when\r\npolished up may be set in a corner on which to display some pieces of\r\nbric-a-brac.\r\n\r\nIf the house has no library, the sitting-room is just the place for\r\nthe bookcase.\r\n\r\nWith house plants in the windows, a room of this character, with\r\nfloods of sunshine, makes a most attractive and comfortable\r\nliving-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE LIBRARY.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the library should be hung with rich, dark colors, the\r\nlatest style in wall paper being a black ground with old gold and\r\nolive-green designs.\r\n\r\nThe carpet comes in Pompeiian red, with moss-green and peacock-blue\r\npatterns. Statuary and the best pictures should find a place in the\r\nlibrary. The library table should be massive and the top laid with\r\ncrimson baize. There should be a few high-backed chairs, upholstered\r\nin leather, a reading-chair, soft rugs, foot-rests, a mantel mirror, a\r\nfew mantel ornaments, and the _piece de resistance_--the bookcase. In\r\nlarge libraries the bookcases are built in the wall. It is quite in\r\nvogue to hang curtains on rods in front of bookcases instead of doors,\r\nbut we think the old style is the best, inasmuch as the books may be\r\nseen and the glass doors exclude the dust.\r\n\r\nHeavy curtains of raw silk, Turcoman, and canton flannel, with a full\r\nvalance at the top, are used for the window drapery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAMBERS.\r\n\r\nThe walls of bedrooms should be decorated in light tints and shadings,\r\nwith a narrow rail and deep frieze. Most housekeepers prefer rugs and\r\noiled floors to carpets, but this is a matter of individual taste.\r\nRugs are as fashionable as they are wholesome and tidy. These\r\nfloor-coverings should be darker than the furniture, yet blending in\r\nshade. If carpets are chosen they should be the lightest shades and in\r\nbright field-flower patterns. Avoid anything dark and somber for the\r\nsleeping-room. Pink and ceil blue combined are very pretty, scarlet\r\nand gray, deep red and very light blue. Dark blue with sprays of lily\r\nof the valley running through it is exceedingly pretty for bedrooms.\r\nDark furniture will harmonize with all these colors, but the lighter\r\nshades are preferable. Cretonnes in pale tints and chintzes in\r\nharmonizing colors are used for light woods. Square pillows of\r\ncretonne on a bamboo or wicker lounge are very pretty. Canton matting\r\nis often used, either plain or in colored patterns.\r\n\r\nFormerly the bed-coverings were spotlessly white, but the profluent\r\ntide of color has included these also. The coverings now in vogue are:\r\nNottingham lace, darned net, applique, antique lace, and Swiss muslin.\r\nThese are used over silk and silesia for backgrounds, and are\r\nexceedingly pretty, with pillow shams to match. Cretonnes, chintzes,\r\ndimities, and silk in crazy work and South Kensington patterns are\r\nalso used.\r\n\r\nCheese cloth, bunting, Swiss muslin, cretonne, and Swiss curtains are\r\nused for window drapery. These may be trimmed with the same fabric or\r\nantique lace. They are hung on poles above the windows and draped back\r\nwith ribbons.\r\n\r\nThe appointments of a bedroom are a low couch, a large rocker, a small\r\nsewing-chair, a workbasket, footstools, a toilet table prettily draped\r\nwith muslin, or a dressing-case, brackets for vases, flowerpots, a few\r\npictures, small table, hanging shelves for books, etc., and the bed.\r\n\r\nThe washstand should have a full set of toilet mats, or a large towel\r\nwith a colored border may be laid on it; also, a splasher placed on\r\nthe wall at the back of the stand is very essential. A screen is a\r\nvery desirable part of the bedroom appointments. A rug should be\r\nplaced in front of the bed and dressing-case.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE DINING-ROOM.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room should be furnished with a view to convenience,\r\nrichness, and comfort. Choose deep, rich grounds for the\r\nwalls--bronze-maroon, black, Pompeiian red, and deep olive--and the\r\ndesigns and traceries in old gold, olive or moss-green, with dado and\r\nfrieze to correspond. Or, the walls may be wainscoted with oak,\r\nwalnut, maple, etc. Some are finished in plain panels, with different\r\nkinds of wood; others, again, are elaborately carved, with fruit,\r\nflowers, and emblems of the chase.\r\n\r\nThe floor is the next point for consideration. It may be of tile or\r\nlaid in alternate strips of different colored woods, with a border of\r\nparquetry. Rugs or carpets may be used on these floors or dispensed\r\nwith, according to taste. If a carpet is used, the dark, rich shades\r\nfound in the Persian and Turkish designs should be chosen.\r\n\r\nThe window drapery should be those deep, rich colors that hold their\r\nown despite time and use--the pomegranates, rich crimsons, dark blues,\r\ndull Pompeiian reds, and soft olives. These curtains may be hung on\r\npoles, and should fall in heavy folds to the floor, then looped back\r\nwith a wide embroidered dado.\r\n\r\nScreens of stained glass are now used in the windows. They are both\r\nuseful and ornamental, for they exclude the strong rays of the sun,\r\nand the light filtering through them beautifies the room with its many\r\nmellow hues.\r\n\r\nDark wood should be used for the furniture. The chairs should be\r\nchosen in square, solid styles, and upholstered in embossed or plain\r\nleather, with an abundance of brass or silver headed nails which are\r\nused for upholstering leather and add much to the substantial\r\nappearance of the articles.\r\n\r\nThe dining-table should be low, square or bevel cornered, heavily\r\ncarved, and when not in use should be covered with a cloth\r\ncorresponding in shade to the window drapery.\r\n\r\nA buffet may stand in one corner for the display of ceramics or\r\ndecorated china. The sideboard should be of high, massive style, with\r\nshelves and racks for glassware and pieces of china.\r\n\r\nA few pictures--two or three fruit pieces and one or two plaques of\r\nstill life--are appropriate.\r\n\r\nA case of stuffed birds, a few large pots of tropical plants, and a\r\nfernery are in keeping with the dining-room appointments. A three-leaf\r\nfolding Japanese screen should not be forgotten; also, a lamp shade of\r\nantique lace, lined with crimson silk, is very desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE KITCHEN.\r\n\r\nIt is a remark too often made that this or that \"is good enough for a\r\nservant.\" If all knew that unpleasant surroundings made unpleasant\r\nservants and ill-prepared meals, we think more pains would be taken to\r\nhave pleasant and comfortable kitchens. There should be a pleasant\r\nwindow or two through which fresh air and floods of sunlight may come,\r\na few plants on the window sill, a small stand for a workbasket, an\r\neasy-chair that the servant may \"drop into\" when an opportunity\r\noffers, the walls painted or calcimined with some cheerful tint, and a\r\ngeneral air of comfort pervading the whole kitchen.--_The Popular Art\r\nInstructor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                                FLORAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     HOW TO CARE FOR HOUSE PLANTS.\r\n\r\nPlants that require a high or low temperature or a very moist\r\natmosphere and plants that bloom only in summer are undesirable.\r\nProcure fresh sandy loam, with an equal mixture of well-rotted turf,\r\nleaf mold, and cow-yard manure, with a small quantity of soot. In\r\nrepotting plants use one size larger than they were grown in.\r\nHard-burned or glazed pots prevent the circulation of air. Secure\r\ndrainage by broken crockery and pebbles laid in the bottom of the pot.\r\nAn abundance of light is important, and when this cannot be given it\r\nis useless to attempt the culture of flowering plants. If possible\r\nthey should have the morning sun, as one hour of sunshine then is\r\nworth two in the afternoon. Fresh air is also essential, but cold,\r\nchilling drafts should be avoided. Water from one to three times a\r\nweek with soft, lukewarm water, draining off all not absorbed by the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DO NOT PERMIT\r\n\r\nwater to stand in the saucers, as the only plant thriving under such\r\ntreatment is the calla lily; and even for these it is not necessary,\r\nunless while blooming. Dust is a great obstacle to the growth of\r\nplants. A good showering will generally remove it, but all the\r\nsmooth-faced plants (such as camellias, ivies, etc.) should be\r\ncarefully sponged so as to keep the foliage clean and healthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PLANTS SUCCEED BEST\r\n\r\nin an even temperature, ranging from sixty to seventy degrees during\r\nthe day and from ten to twelve degrees lower at night. If troubled\r\nwith insects, put them under a box or barrel and smoke from thirty to\r\nsixty minutes with tobacco leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FOR THE RED SPIDER\r\n\r\nthe best remedy is to lay the plants on the side and sprinkle well or\r\nshower. Repeat if necessary. If manures are used, give in a liquid\r\nform.\r\n\r\nSome of the plants most suitable for parlor culture are: Pelargoniums,\r\ngeraniums, fuchsias, palms, begonias, monthly roses, camellias,\r\nazaleas, oranges, lemons, Chinese and English primroses, abutilons,\r\nnarcissus, heliotrope, petunias, and the gorgeous flowering plant,\r\n_Poinsettia pulcherrima_. Camellias and azaleas require a cooler\r\ntemperature than most plants, and the Poinsettia a higher temperature.\r\nDo not sprinkle the foliage of the camellia while the flower buds are\r\nswelling or it will cause them to droop, nor sprinkle them in the\r\nsunshine. They should have a temperature of about forty degrees and\r\nmore shade. By following these rules, healthy flowering plants will be\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nA good way\r\n\r\n\r\n                            TO START SLIPS\r\n\r\nis to partly break off the slip (but do not entirely sever it from the\r\nparent stock), leaving it hanging for ten or twelve days; then remove\r\nand plant in a box of half sand and half leaf mold and it will be well\r\nrooted in a week. Do not water too freely or the slip will rot.\r\n\r\nIf house plants are watered once a week with water in which is mixed a\r\nfew drops of ammonia they will thrive much better. Sometimes small\r\nwhite worms are found in the earth--lime water will kill them. Stir up\r\nthe soil before pouring it on, to expose as many as possible. For\r\nrunning vines, burn beef bones and mix with the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                TO KEEP PLANTS WITHOUT A FIRE AT NIGHT.\r\n\r\nHave made, of wood or zinc, a tray about four inches deep with a\r\nhandle on either end, water-tight. Paint it outside and in, put in\r\neach corner a post as high as the tallest of your plants, and it is\r\nready for use. Arrange your flowerpots in it and fill between them\r\nwith sawdust. This absorbs the moisture falling from the plants when\r\nyou water them and retains the warmth acquired during the day, keeping\r\nthe temperature of the roots even. When you retire at night spread\r\nover the posts a blanket or shawl, and there is no danger of freezing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SURE SHOT FOR ROSE-SLUGS.\r\n\r\nMake a tea of tobacco stems and a soapsuds of whale oil or carbolic\r\nsoap; mix and apply to the bush with a sprinkler, turning the bush so\r\nas to wet the under as well as the upper part of the leaves. Apply,\r\nbefore the sun is up, three or four times.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  TO PREPARE AUTUMN LEAVES AND FERNS.\r\n\r\nImmediately after gathering take a moderately warm iron, smear it well\r\nwith white wax, rub over each surface of the leaf once, applying more\r\nwax for each leaf. This process causes leaves to roll about as when\r\nhanging on the trees. If pressed more they become brittle and remain\r\nperfectly flat. Maple and oak are among the most desirable, and may be\r\ngathered any time after the severe frosts; but the sumac and ivy must\r\nbe secured as soon after the first slight frost as they become tinted\r\nor the leaflets will fall from the stem. Ferns may be selected any\r\ntime during the season. A large book must be used in gathering them,\r\nas they will be spoiled for pressing if carried in the hand. A weight\r\nshould be placed on them until they are perfectly dry; then, excepting\r\nthe most delicate ones, it will be well to press them like the leaves,\r\nas they are liable to curl when placed in a warm atmosphere. These\r\nwill form beautiful combinations with the sumac and ivy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      TO PREPARE SKELETON LEAVES.\r\n\r\nWhen properly prepared, skeleton leaves form a companion to the\r\nscrapbook or collection of pressed ferns, fronds, etc. This is a\r\ntedious operation and requires skill and great patience to obtain\r\nsatisfactory results. Some leaves are easier to dissect and make\r\nbetter specimens than others, and, as a rule, a hard, thin leaf should\r\nbe chosen; that is, when a special variety is not required.\r\n\r\nAmong those which are skeletonized most successfully are the English\r\nivy, box elder, willow, grape, pear, rose, etc. They should be\r\ngathered during the month of June, or as soon as the leaf is fully\r\ndeveloped. The leaves should be immersed in a vessel of rain water and\r\nallowed to remain till decomposed. When this takes place, press the\r\nleaf between pieces of soft flannel, and the film will adhere to the\r\nflannel, leaving a perfect network. Dry off gradually and clean the\r\nspecimen with a soft hair pencil. Place between folds of soft blotting\r\npaper, and when perfectly dry place in your collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO BLEACH THE LEAVES,\r\n\r\ndissolve one half pound of chloride of lime in three pints of rain\r\nwater, strain, and use one part of the solution to one of water. For\r\nferns, use the solution full strength. When perfectly white remove to\r\nclear water, let stand for several hours, changing water two or three\r\ntimes, float out on paper, and press between blotting paper in books.\r\n\r\nIn mounting use mucilage made of five parts gum arabic, three parts\r\nwhite sugar, two parts starch, and very little water; boil and stir\r\ntill thick and white.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HANGING BASKETS.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the _Gardener's Monthly_ tells of a new style of\r\nhanging basket made of round maple sticks about one inch in diameter,\r\neight inches in length at the bottom, increasing to fourteen at the\r\ntop. In constructing, begin at the bottom and build up, log-cabin\r\nfashion; chink the openings with green moss and line the whole basket\r\nwith the same. These are easily kept moist, and the plants droop and\r\ntwine over them very gracefully. A good way to keep the earth moist in\r\na hanging basket without the trouble of taking it down is to fill a\r\nbottle with water and put in two pieces of yarn, leaving one end\r\noutside. Suspend the bottle just above the basket and allow the water\r\nto drip. This will keep the earth moist enough for winter and save a\r\ngreat deal of time and labor. Plant morning glory seeds in hanging\r\nbaskets in winter; they grow rapidly and are very pretty.--_Buckeye._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n                             THE LAUNDRY.\r\n\r\n            TELLING OF A GREAT MANY USEFUL AND LABOR-SAVING\r\n                      PRACTICES FOR THE LAUNDRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TO MAKE WASHING FLUID.\r\n\r\nBring to a boil one pound of sal soda, half a pound of unslaked lime,\r\na small lump of borax, and five quarts of water. Let cool, pour off,\r\nand bottle. Use one teacupful to a boiler of clothes. This is\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              GALL SOAP.\r\n\r\nFor washing woolens, silks, or fine prints liable to fade. One pint\r\nbeefs gall, two pounds common bar soap cut fine, one quart boiling\r\nsoft water; boil slowly, stirring occasionally until well mixed. Pour\r\ninto a flat vessel, and when cold cut into pieces to dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TO TAKE OUT SCORCH.\r\n\r\nIf a shirt bosom or any other article has been scorched in ironing,\r\nlay it where bright sunshine will fall directly on it. It will\r\nentirely remove it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BLUING.\r\n\r\nTake one ounce of Prussian blue, one-half ounce of oxalic acid;\r\ndissolve in one quart of perfectly soft rain water. Insert a quill\r\nthrough the cork of the bluing bottle to prevent waste or putting too\r\nmuch in clothes and you will be pleased with the result. One or two\r\ntablespoons of it is sufficient for a tub of water, according to the\r\nsize of the tub. Chinese blue is the best and costs twelve and a half\r\ncents an ounce, and the acid will cost three cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            COFFEE STARCH.\r\n\r\nMake a paste of two tablespoons best starch and cold water; when\r\nsmooth stir in a pint of perfectly clear coffee, boiling hot; boil\r\nfive or ten minutes. Stir with a spermaceti or wax candle. Strain and\r\nuse for all dark calicoes, percales, and muslins.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FLOUR STARCH.\r\n\r\nHave a clean pan or kettle on stove with one quart boiling water, into\r\nwhich stir three heaping tablespoons flour, previously mixed smooth in\r\na little cold water; stir steadily until it boils and thereafter\r\nenough to keep from burning. Boil about five minutes, and strain,\r\nwhile hot, through a crash towel. The above quantity is enough for one\r\ndress, and will make it nice and stiff.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO MAKE FINE STARCH.\r\n\r\nWet the starch smooth in a little cold water in a large tin pan, pour\r\non a quart of boiling water to two or three tablespoons of starch,\r\nstirring rapidly all the while; place on stove, stir until it boils\r\nand then occasionally. Boil from five to fifteen minutes, or until the\r\nstarch is perfectly clear. Some add a little salt or butter or pure\r\nlard or stir with a sperm candle; others add a teaspoon of kerosene to\r\none quart of starch. This prevents the stickiness sometimes so\r\nannoying in ironing.\r\n\r\nCold starch is made from starch dissolved in cold water, being careful\r\nnot to have it too thick. Since it rots the clothes, it is not\r\nadvisable to use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ENAMEL FOR SHIRT BOSOMS.\r\n\r\nMelt together, with a gentle heat, one ounce white wax and two ounces\r\nspermaceti. Prepare in the usual way a sufficient quantity of starch\r\nfor a dozen shirt bosoms, put into it a piece of this enamel the size\r\nof a hazelnut. This will give your clothes a beautiful polish.\r\n\r\n\r\n                TO CLEAN ARTICLES MADE OF WHITE ZEPHYR.\r\n\r\nRub in flour or magnesia, changing often. Shake off and hang in the\r\nopen air a short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HOW TO CLEAN VELVET.\r\n\r\nInvert a hot flatiron, place over it a single thickness of wet cotton\r\ncloth, lay on this the velvet (wrong side next the wet cloth), rub\r\ngently with a dry cloth until the pile is well raised, take off the\r\niron, lay on a table, and brush it with a soft brush or cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TO CLEAN RIBBONS.\r\n\r\nDissolve white soap in boiling water; when cool enough to bear the\r\nhand, pass the ribbons through it, rubbing gently, so as not to injure\r\nthe texture; rinse through lukewarm water and pin on a board to dry.\r\nIf the colors are bright yellow, maroon, crimson or scarlet, add a few\r\ndrops of oil of vitriol to the rinse water; if the color is bright\r\nscarlet, add to the rinse water a few drops of muriate of tin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TO TAKE OUT PAINT.\r\n\r\nEqual parts of ammonia and spirits of turpentine will take paint out\r\nof clothing. Saturate the spot two or three times, and then wash out\r\nin soapsuds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO REMOVE INK STAIN.\r\n\r\nImmediately saturate with milk, soak it up with a rag, apply more, rub\r\nwell, and in a few minutes the ink will disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TO TAKE GREASE OUT\r\n\r\nof silk, woolens, paper, floors, etc., grate chalk thick over the\r\nspot, cover with brown paper, set on it a hot flatiron and let it\r\nremain until cool; repeat if necessary. The iron must not be so hot as\r\nto burn paper or cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FRUIT STAINS.\r\n\r\nColored cottons or woolens stained with wine or fruit should be wet in\r\nalcohol and ammonia, then sponged off gently (not rubbed) with\r\nalcohol; after that, if the material will warrant it, washed in tepid\r\nsoapsuds. Silk may be wet with this preparation when injured by these\r\nstains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO REMOVE IRON RUST.\r\n\r\nWhile rinsing clothes, take such as have spots of iron, wring out, dip\r\na wet finger in oxalic acid and rub on the spot, then dip in salt and\r\nrub on and hold on a warm flatiron, and the spot will immediately\r\ndisappear; rinse again, rubbing the place a little with the hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TO TAKE OUT MILDEW.\r\n\r\nWet the cloth and rub on soap and chalk, mixed together, and lay in\r\nthe sun; or, lay the cloth in buttermilk for a short time, take out\r\nand place in the hot sun; or, put lemon juice on and treat in the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO WASH WOOLEN GOODS.\r\n\r\nMany woolen goods, such as light-colored, heavy sacques, nubias, etc.,\r\nmay be washed in cold suds and rinsed in cold water. The garments\r\nshould be well shaken out and pulled into shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   TO WASH FLANNELS IN TEPID WATER.\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of liquid ammonia is not as universally known among\r\nhousewives as it deserves to be. If you add some of it to a soapsuds\r\nmade of a mild soap it will prevent the flannel from becoming yellow\r\nor shrinking. It is the potash and soda combined in sharp soap which\r\ntend to color animal fibers yellow; the shrinking may be partially due\r\nto this agency, but above all to the exposure of the flannel while wet\r\nto the extremes of low and high temperature. Dipping it in boiling\r\nwater or leaving it out in the rain will also cause it to shrink and\r\nbecome hard. To preserve their softness, flannels should be washed in\r\ntepid suds, rinsed in tepid water, and dried rapidly at a moderate\r\nheat.--_Buckeye._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n        HOW TO DO YOUR OWN STAMPING AND MAKE YOUR OWN PATTERNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following chapter are given full instructions for dry and wet\r\nstamping, explaining how to make stamping powder, how to mix white\r\npaint for stamping dark goods and black paint for stamping light\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nThe articles necessary are a sheet of writing paper and a piece of\r\ntransfer paper. The transfer paper can be made by rubbing white paper\r\nwith a composition consisting of two ounces of tallow, one-half ounce\r\npowdered blacklead, one-quarter pint linseed oil, and sufficient\r\nlampblack to make it of the consistency of cream. These should be\r\nmelted together and rubbed on the paper while hot. When dry it will be\r\nfit for use.\r\n\r\nIn order to make a perforated pattern of any engraving, procure a\r\npiece of writing paper larger than the design to be traced and put a\r\npiece of transfer paper on the writing paper, then place both sheets\r\ndirectly under the engraving and pin the three sheets together at one\r\nend, having the transfer paper between and dark side facing the\r\nwriting paper. You then take a quill with a fine point (a knitting\r\nneedle will do nicely) and without leaning too hard go over all the\r\noutline of the engraving. You must be careful not to press your\r\nfingers on the engraving, as this would cause a deposit of powder the\r\nsame color as the transferring paper on the writing paper. Now remove\r\nthe transfer paper and you have the design accurately traced and the\r\npattern is ready to be perforated. Lay a couple of folds of velvet or\r\nfelt on the table, place the pattern on this, and with a needle of\r\nmedium size or tracing-wheel prick out the pattern, being careful to\r\nfollow the outline closely and make the perforations quite close.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  MECHANICAL ENLARGEMENT OF DESIGNS.\r\n\r\nThe simplest way is to enlarge by the eye, as the artists do. One\r\nmethod is to divide the whole design into squares and rule off the\r\npaper to be enlarged in corresponding squares of larger size. Each\r\nportion within the square is then exactly reproduced, copying the\r\nportion in the smaller square. For embroidery designs especially we\r\nshould think this would be very good.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DRY STAMPING.\r\n\r\nThis is done by a process known as pouncing. The process is as\r\nfollows: Place the pattern (rough side up) on the material to be\r\nstamped, placing heavy weights on the corner to keep it from slipping;\r\nthen rub the powder over the perforations with the pouncet or\r\ndistributor described below till the pattern is clearly marked on the\r\nmaterial. This can be ascertained by lifting one corner of the pattern\r\nslightly. Then remove the pattern carefully, lay a piece of thin paper\r\nover the stamping and pass a hot iron over it. This melts the gum in\r\nthe powder and fastens the pattern to the material. The iron should be\r\nas hot as possible without scorching the cloth. Should the heat change\r\nthe color of the material, iron it all over. Do not do any stamping by\r\nthis process on a hot or damp day if it can be avoided. Keep the\r\npowder in a cool, dry place. In stamping with light-colored powder,\r\nthe best way to fasten it is to hold the back of the cloth against the\r\nstovepipe or the face of the iron. French stamping is better, however,\r\nfor all dark materials. To take the powder up on the distributor, have\r\na tin plate with a piece of woolen cloth glued on the bottom, sprinkle\r\na little powder on the cloth, and rub the distributor over it, taking\r\ncare to shake off all the powder you can--enough will remain to stamp\r\nthe pattern clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TO MAKE A DISTRIBUTOR.\r\n\r\nTake a strip of fine felt almost an inch wide (a strip from an old\r\nfelt hat is as good as anything), roll it up tightly into a roll,\r\nleaving the end flat, and rub the end over a piece of sand paper to\r\nmake it smooth and even.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO MAKE BLUE POWDER.\r\n\r\nTake equal parts of gum damar and white rosin and just enough Persian\r\nblue to color it. Mix well together.\r\n\r\nOther colors are made the same, using for coloring chrome yellow (for\r\nlight-colored powder), burnt sienna, lampblack, etc. Black powder is\r\nimproved by adding a little blue to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO MAKE WHITE POWDER.\r\n\r\nTake one ounce white lead; half ounce gum arabic, in the impalpable\r\npowder; half ounce white rosin, in the fine powder. All well mixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SUPERIOR DARK BLUE POWDER.\r\n\r\nOne ounce white rosin; one half ounce gum sandarac; one half ounce\r\nPrussian blue, in fine powder. Mix all thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      FRENCH INDELIBLE STAMPING.\r\n\r\nThis is the best process for all dark materials; in fact, this and the\r\nblue powder are all that will ever be needed. By this process a kind\r\nof paint is used instead of powder, and a brush instead of a pouncet.\r\nPlace the pattern on the cloth, smooth side up if you can (though\r\neither side will work well), weight the pattern down as in stamping.\r\nRub the paint evenly over the perforations, and it will leave the\r\nlines clean, sharp and distinct. After the stamping is done, the\r\npattern must be cleaned immediately. This is done by placing the\r\npattern on the table and turning benzine or naphtha over it to cut the\r\npaint and then wiping the pattern dry on both sides with an old cloth,\r\nor, better still, with common waste--such as machinists use to clean\r\nmachinery; this is cheap and absorbs the paint and naphtha quickly.\r\nHold the pattern up to the light to see if the holes are all clear; if\r\nthey are not, wash it the second time. Do not use the pattern for\r\npowder immediately after it has been washed; let it dry a short time,\r\notherwise the moistened gum will clog the perforations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TO MAKE THE PAINT.\r\n\r\nTake zinc white, mix it with boiled oil to about the thickness of\r\ncream, add a little drying, such as painters use. Keep in a tin pail\r\n(one holding about a pint is a good size); have a piece of board cut\r\nround, with a screw in the center for a handle, to fit _loosely_ into\r\nthe pail; drop this on the paint and it will keep it from drying up.\r\nAdd a little oil occasionally to keep the paint from growing too\r\nthick, and it will always be ready for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE BRUSH.\r\n\r\nTake a fine stencil brush (or any brush with a square end), wind it\r\ntightly with a string from the handle down to within one half inch of\r\nthe end; this will make it just stiff enough to distribute the paint\r\nwell. Keep the brush in water, to keep it from drying up, taking care\r\nto wipe off the water before using.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE CARE OF PATTERNS.\r\n\r\nNew patterns, before being used, should be rubbed over on the rough\r\nside with a smooth piece of pumice stone; this wears off the burr and\r\nmakes the stamping come out cleaner and finer. When patterns are so\r\nlarge that they have to be folded, iron out the creases before using\r\nthem. After using the patterns for powder stamping, snap the pattern\r\nto shake the powder from the perforations. After using the patterns\r\nfor paint stamping they should be washed thoroughly with naphtha until\r\nthe perforations are all perfectly clear. Keep the naphtha away from\r\nthe fire. After the pattern has been washed, do not use it for powder\r\nuntil it has had time to thoroughly dry, otherwise it will gum up the\r\nholes and spoil the pattern.\r\n\r\nIf these directions are carefully followed the stamping will always be\r\nsatisfactory.--_Popular Art Instructor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n                             BRONZE WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nBronzing is the latest improvement in waxwork, and if properly made\r\ncannot be detected from the most expensive artistic bronze. It answers\r\nfor table, mantel, and bracket ornaments, and may be exposed to dust\r\nand air without sustaining the slightest injury. It can be dusted with\r\na feather duster like any piece of furniture, and is a very desirable\r\nand inexpensive ornament.\r\n\r\nThe colors required in bronze are: Silver bronze, gold bronze, copper\r\nbronze, fire bronze, and green bronze.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE ART OF MAKING A VASE IN BRONZE.\r\n\r\nFor instruction, let us take a vase to be finished in copper bronze.\r\nFirst the vase must be molded. The casting material is one part wax,\r\none part spermaceti, two parts mutton tallow. Melt the three articles\r\ntogether and color with burnt umber. Have a coil of fine hair wire,\r\ncut into one-half inch lengths, and when the mixture is melted to the\r\nconsistency of thick cream stir in the cut wire by degrees until there\r\nis a sprinkling of it throughout the mixture; then pour into the\r\nelastic mold and let stand till perfectly cold and solid; then loosen\r\nthe sections of the mold and take it out. Should any of the ends of\r\nthe wire project, they can be cut with a pair of sharp scissors. Trim\r\nthe seams caused by the sections of the mold; then take a piece of\r\nsoft flannel cloth, dip it in the refined spirits of turpentine and\r\npolish the vase with it, after which it is ready for bronzing.\r\n\r\nTake copper bronze No. 4000, and with the tinting brush bronze the\r\nvase evenly, and polish it with a soft piece of white silk. Now take\r\nanother brush and with copper bronze No. 6000 give it the last coat\r\nThe vase is now ready for draping. The most simple drapery is an ivy\r\nvine. Take an embossed ivy leaf (or embossed muslin leaves, as they\r\nare named), lay a fine wire along its midrib, leaving two or three\r\ninches of wire for stem; cover the leaf with brown sheet wax, press\r\nthem together well with the finger and thumb to make the wax adhere to\r\nthe leaf, get the impression, and hold the wire firmly; then lay\r\nanother piece of wax on the under side, press the edges together and\r\ncut away the superfluous wax, leaving the edge plain (the ivy leaf is\r\nnot serrated), cover the wire stem with wax and the leaf is ready for\r\nbronzing. Rub both sides with turpentine, give one coat of bronze No.\r\n4000, then the last coat of bronze No. 6000. When all the leaves are\r\nfinished, weave them into a spray, grading them from large to small\r\ntill the end of the vine is reached, then bronze and drape around the\r\nvase in an easy, natural way.\r\n\r\nThe natural fall leaves, pressed, make pretty draperies for these\r\nkinds of vases. Sprays of mixed leaves, oak leaves and acorns, small\r\nmaple leaves, the holly leaf and berry, mixed ivy and fern leaves, and\r\nmany other kinds of leaves and vines are equally pretty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE ART OF MAKING A MOTTO IN BRONZE.\r\n\r\nTake a box frame of the ordinary motto-frame size (gilt face) and line\r\nit with either crimson or royal purple velvet, and it is ready for any\r\ndesign. The word \"Welcome\" is the simplest to begin with. Take a thick\r\nblotting pad, lay it on a table, rub some arrowroot or rice power over\r\nits upper surface, and lay a sheet of either calla or pond lily wax,\r\n_extra thick_, on this powdered surface. Select the style of letter\r\npreferred; German text is very appropriate for the motto \"Welcome.\"\r\nCut the pattern letters out in pasteboard, or any kind of thick paper,\r\nif tin letter-cutters are not convenient.\r\n\r\nBegin with the letter W. Lay it on the sheet of wax and cut out the\r\nwaxen letter after the pattern with a penknife previously dipped in\r\nwater. Next cut the E, and so on till the seven letters are cut out,\r\ncare being taken to powder the blotter every time a new sheet of wax\r\nis laid on. Lay the back of the box on the table, having melted glue\r\nready, and with a camel's-hair brush apply a small portion of it to\r\nthe back of each letter as it is set in its relative position,\r\npressing it gently against the velvet with the palm of the hand. The\r\nletters should be set an inch apart, and when all on the frame should\r\nbe set away until the glue is thoroughly dry and the waxen letters\r\nadhere firmly to the velvet, then they are ready for ornamenting. This\r\nis done in various ways, and all depends on the artist's taste, but a\r\nfew suggestions may not be amiss.\r\n\r\nTake a two-inch fern-cutter and cut the ferns out of double sheet wax;\r\nthen bronze them as directed on both sides, either with gold or silver\r\nbronze. Begin with draping the letter W. Take the stem end of the fern\r\nleaf and with the bead end of the curling-pin fasten it to the lower\r\nside of the letter; then turn it over and fasten it down in the\r\nmiddle, letting the point turn outward. Set the ferns on the letters\r\nin such a way as not to obscure their form, _i. e._, the form of the\r\nletters. If the motto is made in white wax it should be frosted with\r\ndiamond dust.\r\n\r\nA pretty style of motto is clasped hands in the center, of pure white\r\nwax, surrounded with sprays of fine flowers and buds, finished in fire\r\nbronze.\r\n\r\nAnother style of motto is a vase in the center, from which vines in\r\ndifferent colors of bronze run. Green, fire, and copper bronzing\r\nshould have a light background; silver and gold bronzing should have a\r\ndark background.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE ART OF MAKING A FLORAL BASKET IN BRONZE.\r\n\r\nTake a medium-sized basket (chip or any solid substance), brush it\r\nwith glue on the inside, fill it with moss, and set it away to dry\r\ntill the moss is stuck to the basket. The moss should be raised in the\r\ncenter in the form of a mound. Have the wax sheeted in carmine. Make\r\nthe center of the basket in roses, rosebuds, and carnations, as they\r\nare the most durable. Mold the petals over the embossed muslin petals\r\nand bronze them with fire bronze--Nos. 4000 and 6000--as previously\r\ndirected. Drape the basket and the handle in smilax, having the wax\r\nfor the smilax sheeted in chrome green; then mold over the embossed\r\nmuslin leaves, bronze in green bronze, and drape loosely. Such a\r\nbasket makes a pretty table ornament.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DIRECTIONS FOR BRONZING.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of ornaments may be made in bronze--small animals, fish,\r\nshells, birds, statuary, etc. The mixture for casts should be the same\r\nshade as the bronze used.\r\n\r\nFish may be bronzed in silver, gold, and copper bronze; shells in\r\nsilver, copper, gold, and some may be tinted with fire bronze on the\r\nexterior of the shell, but the interior of almost all shells must be\r\ntinted with paint; dogs in zinc, silver, and copper; birds in almost\r\nany shade.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GREEN BRONZE STATUARY.\r\n\r\nPrepare the mixture in chrome green No. 1. A little rosin may be added\r\nand a thick sprinkling of cut wire. Trim the object and rub with\r\nspirits of turpentine, then apply the green bronze--the two numbers,\r\nas directed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        COPPER BRONZE STATUARY.\r\n\r\nPrepare the mixture in burnt umber and proceed as directed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BRONZING STATUETTES.\r\n\r\nStatuettes, or any object in plaster of Paris, may be made to resemble\r\nbronze by first rendering the plaster nonabsorbent with drying linseed\r\noil and then painting it with a varnish made by grinding waste gold\r\nleaf with honey or gum water.\r\n\r\nAnother method is by first painting the article, after it has been\r\nrendered nonabsorbent, of a dark color made of Prussian blue, yellow\r\nochre, and verditer, ground in oil. Before this becomes quite dry,\r\nbronze powder of several colors should be dusted on those most\r\nprominent parts which may be supposed to have worn bright. Plaster\r\ncasts may also be made to resemble bronze to a certain extent by\r\nmerely brushing them over with graphite, which is a brilliant\r\nblacklead.\r\n\r\n\r\n               METHOD OF MAKING EMBOSSED MUSLIN LEAVES.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of green muslin or calico and size it well with\r\nisinglass, then take the natural leaf, lay the sized piece of muslin\r\nover it on the under or veined side of the leaf, let the muslin remain\r\non it till almost dry and the impression is set; then with a pair of\r\nsharp scissors cut the muslin around the leaf, either plain or\r\nserrated.\r\n\r\nThe impression may be taken of any leaf or flower in this way. The use\r\nof muslin leaves tends to make the work more durable and is found very\r\nconvenient for the artist.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE ART OF MAKING EXOTIC LEAVES.\r\n\r\nThe begonia rex makes a beautiful parlor plant. Five or seven leaves\r\nmake a nice-sized plant: Select five or seven healthy begonia leaves\r\nof different sizes, as no two leaves of the rex are of one size on the\r\nsame plant. Cut the leaves closely off the stem and immerse them in a\r\nsolution of cold water and castile soap. Leave them in this twelve\r\nhours before using. Melt the wax to the consistency of cream, in\r\nchrome green, permanent green, dark olive-green, and verdigris-green.\r\nNow take a leaf out of the soapsuds and lay it on a marble slab,\r\nkeeping the under surface or veined side uppermost; then with a\r\ncamel's-hair brush lay on the melted wax in different shades,\r\nfollowing the shades of the natural leaf. The soapsuds having made the\r\nleaf transparent, all the shades and spots can be plainly seen on the\r\nveined side, which is the side the waxen leaf has to be formed on. The\r\nbelt of light green over the silvery markings of the leaf should be\r\nput on with verdigris-green. Begin the leaf in the center and continue\r\non each side of the midrib till the edge is reached and the leaf has a\r\nthick coating of wax. Then lay a wire along the midrib or center of\r\nthe leaf, fasten it in the wax by pressing, care being taken to leave\r\nit long enough for eight or nine inches of stem. Wire must also be\r\nlaid on all the side ribs or veins leading to the midrib. These small\r\nwires are all brought to the center wire and laid evenly by its side\r\ntill they all come to the stem, where they are all twisted around it\r\nto form one long, thick stem. Give the leaf another coating of dark\r\nolive-green wax (this covers the wires), then finish with a thin\r\ncoating of burnt umber tinted with Vandyke brown, and the under\r\nsurface of the leaf is finished. Remove the natural leaf from the\r\nwaxen and tint the veins lightly with carmine. Brush a little carmine\r\nloosely on the darkest shade in the center of the leaf, and before it\r\nsticks blow off as much as possible, when enough will be left to give\r\nit that reddish-green tint peculiar to the begonia rex leaf. The next\r\nis to finish the silver belt or silvery leaf-markings midway between\r\nthe center and the edge of the leaf. This strip must be rubbed with\r\nspirits of turpentine; then with the tinting brush apply a coating of\r\nsilver bronze (Nos. 4000 and 6000), care being taken that the bronze\r\ndoes not scatter over the leaf. Now the leaf is finished.\r\n\r\nIf the work is done according to directions, the waxen leaf will be a\r\ntrue copy of the original. Continue in the same way till all the\r\nleaves are made, then wax the stems and run them through the begonia\r\nstemming, when they may be arranged in their natural growing manner in\r\na flowerpot filled with moss; or, if preferred, the flowerpot may be\r\nfilled with wax, in _terre-verte_ green, and the stems must be placed\r\nin it before the wax gets hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     HOW TO MAKE BEGONIA STEMMING.\r\n\r\nProcure the bristles of a very young pig, five or six weeks old. After\r\nwashing, put them in a very strong solution of chloride of lime and\r\nlet them remain in it till whitened; then rinse well in warm water\r\ntill free from chlorine. Color them while damp, some in different\r\nshades of green and some in different shades of brown. After the\r\nbristles are ready, the next thing is to make the stemming. Take a\r\nsquare piece of cambric and fasten it in a stretcher, then give it a\r\nthick coating of mastic varnish, and when the varnish is dry cut the\r\ncambric on a true bias into straight strips of different widths, from\r\nan inch to two inches, and half a yard in length. Lay one of these\r\nstrips on a table or some smooth surface, add another coat of varnish,\r\nthen cover it with glaucous green flock, care being taken to leave a\r\nnarrow margin bare on one side to lap under the other when the piping\r\nis being made. Dip the bristles in mastic varnish, sprinkle them\r\nthickly over the flock, and leave for twenty-four hours to dry; when\r\nthoroughly dry, revarnish the bare edge, and turn it in underneath the\r\nother edge, thus forming the strip into a pipe, ready to receive the\r\nwire stems of the leaves. Brown and crimson flock may be used.\r\n\r\nFor begonia rex, use crimson flock; for the rubra, use glaucous flock;\r\nand for the palmata, use brown flock. Very good stemming may be made\r\nby tinting canton flannel, which has a very long nap or pile.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GERANIUM LEAVES--ROSE GERANIUM.\r\n\r\nThis leaf is of a dark chrome green. Prepare the wax in two shades,\r\ndark chrome green and light; immerse the leaves in soapsuds for six\r\nhours; take out of the soapsuds and lay it on the marble slab. As\r\nthere is neither shading nor marking on the leaf, all that is required\r\nis to give it a coat of dark chrome green, thick enough to prevent the\r\nwires from showing; then lay the wires over the veins and coat them\r\nover with a light shade of green. Remove the natural leaf, and as the\r\ntexture of the rose geranium leaf is rather rough, rub it over with\r\ngreen flock mixed with hair powder. The stems may be left in different\r\nlengths.\r\n\r\nThe best directions that we can give for the tinting and marking of\r\nleaves is to copy from nature. The cyclamen leaf is well adapted for\r\nthe practice of marking and tinting.\r\n\r\nThe leaf of the pond lily, lotus, canna, maranta, rubber tree,\r\nmagnolia, camellia, orange, and all leaves which have a waxy surface,\r\nshould either be varnished or bronzed.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of leaves may be made by the foregoing directions.--_Popular\r\nArt Instructor._\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DECALCOMANIA.\r\n\r\nThis is another name for a style that has been in vogue for an\r\nindefinite, period of time, and comes under the head of transferring.\r\nIt is almost superfluous to mention the variety of purposes to which\r\ndecalcomania may be applied, as it can be transferred upon everything\r\nfor which ornamentation is required, and the variety of designs which\r\nare printed especially for it is so great that something may easily be\r\nprocured to suit the taste of the most fastidious.\r\n\r\nA few of the articles that may be decorated can be mentioned by way of\r\nshowing what a variety this style of ornamentation will embrace: All\r\nkinds of crockery, china, porcelain, vases, glass, bookcases, folios,\r\nboxes, lap desks, ribbons, dresses, etc. The method of transferring\r\nbeautiful designs is so simple, and all the materials requisite for\r\nthe art so easily procured, that it brings it within the means of\r\neveryone. Flat surfaces are more suitable than concave or convex ones\r\nfor this style of decorating, for when the surface is curved the\r\ndesign has to be cut to accommodate the shape, and in this way is\r\noften spoiled unless done by the most careful and skillful hand. The\r\nmaterials required are cement, copal varnish, designs, a duck-quill\r\nsable, and a flat camel's-hair brush.\r\n\r\nCut your designs neatly with a small pair of scissors, apply the\r\ncement by means of the sable to the article to be decorated, place on\r\nyour design and press equally over its entire surface to exclude the\r\nair; dampen it a little and keep pressing equally so that the design\r\nmay adhere firmly in every part. When the cement is sufficiently dry\r\ndampen again with water (a little more freely) and remove the paper.\r\nBe careful in manipulating this process, or you will remove some of\r\nthe colored part with it. If such should occur, instantly replace it\r\nas well as you are able, or, if you have a knowledge of Oriental\r\npainting, your panacea will be in that. You can retouch with these\r\ncolors and bring it back nearly to its original beauty. In case you\r\nhave no knowledge of Oriental painting, match the colors as nearly as\r\npossible with water-color paints, allow time to dry, and varnish with\r\ncopal.\r\n\r\nSometimes the cement becomes too thick for use. It may be restored to\r\nits proper flowing consistency by placing the bottle in a bed of warm\r\nsand, and can then be applied while warm. If you apply your design to\r\na dark groundwork, it would be desirable to give your picture a\r\ncoating of Winsor and Newton's Chinese white. The reason for this is\r\nthat some parts of the picture are semi-transparent, and these would\r\nlose their brilliancy if transferred directly upon a dark background\r\nwithout first painting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO TRANSFER ON WOOD.\r\n\r\nDissolve some salt in soft water, float your engraving on the\r\nsurface--picture side uppermost--and let it remain about an hour. The\r\nscreen, box or table on which you wish to transfer the design should\r\nbe of bird's-eye maple or other light-colored hardwood, varnished with\r\nthe best copal or transfer varnish.\r\n\r\nTake the picture from the water, dry a little between blotters, place\r\nthe engraving--picture side downwards--on the varnished wood and\r\nsmooth it nicely. If the picture entirely covers the wood after the\r\nmargin has been cut off so that no varnish is exposed, lay over it a\r\nthin board, on which place a heavy weight, and leave it for\r\ntwenty-four hours. If you wish but a small picture in the center of\r\nthe surface of the wood, apply the varnish only to a space the size of\r\nthe picture. Dip your finger in the solution of salt and water and\r\ncommence rubbing off the paper; the nearer you come to the engraving\r\nthe more careful you must be, as a hole in it will spoil your work.\r\nRub slowly and patiently until you have taken off every bit of the\r\npaper and left only the black lines and touches of your picture on the\r\nwood, in an inverted direction. Finish up with two or three coats of\r\ncopal varnish.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO TRANSFER ON SILK.\r\n\r\nApply a coating of mastic varnish to the design and allow it to dry;\r\nthen with a brush wash the paper surrounding the design carefully;\r\nthis removes from the paper the preparation, which would otherwise\r\nsoil the silk. Apply a second coating of the same varnish, and when\r\nthis is slightly dried place the design upon the silk or other fabric\r\nto be decorated, and with the roller press it well down. With the\r\nbrush wet the back of the paper covering the design, when the paper\r\nmay be at once lifted off. Another method is to cut out the design\r\ncarefully and cover it with a thin coating of mastic varnish, and lay\r\nit upon the silk or other fabric (which should be dampened) and roll\r\nthoroughly with a rubber roller; dampen the back of the paper with the\r\nbrush and lift it off as previously directed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO MAKE WAX FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nThe following articles will be required to commence waxwork: Two\r\npounds white wax, one quarter pound hair wire, one bottle carmine, one\r\nbottle ultramarine blue, one bottle chrome yellow, two bottles chrome\r\ngreen No. 1, one bottle each of rose pink, royal purple, scarlet\r\npowder, and balsam fir; two dozen sheets white wax. This will do to\r\nbegin with. Now have a clean tin dish, and pour therein a quart or two\r\nof water; then put in about one pound of the white wax and let it\r\nboil. When cool enough so the bubbles will not form on top it is ready\r\nto sheet, which is done as follows: Take half of a window pane, 7 x 9,\r\nand, after having washed it clean, dip into a dish containing weak\r\nsoapsuds; then dip into the wax, and draw it out steadily and plunge\r\nit into the suds, when the sheet will readily come off. Lay it on a\r\ncloth or clean paper to dry. Proceed in like manner until you have\r\nenough of the white; then add enough of the green powder to make a\r\nbright color, and heat and stir thoroughly until the color is evenly\r\ndistributed, then proceed as for sheeting white wax. The other colors\r\nare rubbed into the leaves after they are cut out, rubbing light or\r\nheavy according to shade.\r\n\r\nFor patterns you can use any natural leaf, forming the creases in wax\r\nwith the thumb nail or a needle. To put the flowers together, or the\r\nleaves on to the stem, hold in the hand until warm enough to stick. If\r\nthe sheeted wax is to be used in summer, put in a little balsam of fir\r\nto make it hard. If for winter, none will be required.\r\n\r\nYou can make many flowers without a teacher, but one to assist in the\r\ncommencement would be a great help, though the most particular thing\r\nabout it is to get the wax sheeted. The materials I have suggested can\r\nbe procured at any drug store, and will cost from $3.00 to $4.50.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear lady subscriber, if you are a housekeeper, or ever intend to be\r\none, this chapter will more than repay you for what you have given for\r\nthis book. It will tell you how to save a large percentage of your\r\nhousehold expenses, and also how to have a great many of the articles\r\nyou use in your daily household work of a superior quality--vastly\r\nbetter than the ones you are using at the present time.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact not generally known that a great many of the articles\r\nused in daily household work cost little more than one-tenth of the\r\nprice the consumer pays for them. We propose to show the ladies of our\r\ngreat Continent how to have, in most instances, better articles than\r\nthose they are in the habit of purchasing, and at a small percentage\r\nof the cost. To do this, we have, by our own personal investigation,\r\ngathered a number of valuable recipes together, and have paid for the\r\nprivilege of using them. Remember, these are not common recipes, but a\r\nfull explanation of the manufacture of different articles needed in\r\nevery household; and they combine the embodied wisdom of practical and\r\nsuccessful men and women of the past and present.\r\n\r\nWe give in this chapter a number of recipes which have never before\r\nbeen published, and which, once possessing, you will never wish to be\r\nwithout, as they are truly marvelous discoveries. The first three\r\nevery mother should have; the remainder no housekeeper should be\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 is\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HEALING SALVE.\r\n\r\nThis salve heals all sores, chaps, cuts, bruises, sore lips, chafed\r\nlimbs, roughness, etc. It is invaluable as a healing ointment and may\r\nbe applied to the tenderest skin without injury, and yet it will heal\r\nthe most painful sores. A three-ounce box will only cost you ten\r\ncents, and the directions are so plain that a child can follow them.\r\n\r\n_Recipe:_ Take one ounce of sweet oil, one-half ounce of camphor gum,\r\nand one-half ounce of mutton tallow. Melt all together over a slow\r\nfire, and stir continually until cold.\r\n\r\n_To use:_ Rub on part affected at night; wash off in the morning with\r\nwarm water and castile soap.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 is\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MAGNETIC CROUP CURE.\r\n\r\nThis is the best remedy for croup ever discovered. It will save\r\nparents much trouble and anxiety. With this remedy all that is\r\nnecessary is (if you have any fear of croup on putting your child to\r\nbed) to take a piece of brown paper large enough to cover the throat\r\nand chest and spread it with the ointment and put across the throat\r\nand lungs; place over that several thicknesses of flannel so as to\r\nkeep the stomach warm, and keep in place with a string or bandage. Put\r\nthe child to bed, and you need have no fear of croup that night. This\r\nointment is also excellent for cuts, bruises or sores. Twelve cents\r\nwill make enough to last a year, even if you use it frequently.\r\n\r\n_Recipe:_ One-half pound of lard, quarter of a pound of raisins,\r\nquarter pound of fine cut chewing tobacco. In the morning place the\r\ntobacco in a tin can and cover it with water; set it on the stove and\r\nlet it cook and boil all day, replacing the water when it is\r\nnecessary; then squeeze all the juice from the tobacco. The next\r\nmorning chop your raisins, put them in the tobacco water and cook well\r\ntill noon; then again squeeze the raisins out of this water. Now to\r\nthis water add the lard and let them simmer together until the water\r\nis evaporated. Now the croup remedy is ready for use. On putting the\r\nchild to bed, if you fear an attack, take a piece of brown paper large\r\nenough to cover the throat and chest and spread it over with the\r\nointment and put it across the throat and lungs. Place over that and\r\ntie several thicknesses of flannel; put the child to bed, cover up\r\nwarmly, and you need have no fear of croup that night.\r\n\r\nIf taken with croup unexpectedly, on hearing the cough, spread a piece\r\nof brown paper with the ointment and lay it across the throat and\r\nchest; then heat flannel as hot as can be borne and lay over the\r\npaper; change in about ten minutes for another hot cloth. If no fire\r\nis on while waiting for it, heat cloths on a lamp chimney. As soon as\r\nyou get the stomach covered and warm, give a teaspoonful of melted\r\nbutter; repeat the dose in five minutes.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 is\r\n\r\n\r\n                             WORM ELIXIR.\r\n\r\nThe best remedy for worms known. No mother should be without it. Also,\r\nif given occasionally it is a splendid preventive. Children will never\r\nbe troubled with worms who are given a dose of this once a month, or\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\n_Recipe:_ Take gum myrrh and aloes, of each one ounce; saffron, sage\r\nleaves, and tansy leaves, of each half an ounce; tincture in a pint of\r\nbrandy two weeks, and give to children a teaspoonful once a week to\r\nonce a month as a preventive. They will never be troubled with worms\r\nas long as you do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WORM VERMIFUGE.\r\n\r\nMake a strong decoction of sage, two parts; wormseed, one part;\r\nstrain, and add sugar enough to make into candy, and let the child eat\r\nof it. Infallible.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 is\r\n\r\n\r\n                 BRILLIANT SELF-SHINING STOVE POLISH.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the greatest inventions of the age. It has been the\r\nresult of a large amount of study on the part of the inventor to\r\nperfect a polish that would work easily and satisfactorily in a\r\nperfectly dry state, thereby obviating the disagreeable task of mixing\r\nand preparing. A good stove polish is an absolute necessity in every\r\nfamily. To be assured that this is the best you need give it only one\r\ntrial. Now, remember, first, that this polish requires no water or\r\nmixing like the various cake and powder polishes; second, that it is\r\nself-shining and no labor is required; and third, that it has no equal\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nBelow are the recipe and directions for preparing this polish. You can\r\nprepare enough in ten minutes to last a year. A box holding two ounces\r\nwill cost but three cents.\r\n\r\n_Recipe:_ Get from the hardware store plumbago (blacklead), pulverize\r\nit finely and it is ready for use.\r\n\r\n_Directions for use:_ Use a damp woolen rag, dip in the polish and\r\napply to the stove; then rub with a dry cloth, and a most beautiful\r\npolish will appear.\r\n\r\nNo. 5 is\r\n\r\n\r\n                       WONDERFUL STARCH ENAMEL.\r\n\r\nFor polishing shirt bosoms, collars, cuffs, lace curtains, etc.,\r\nputting on the same gloss and hard pearl finish as when bought at the\r\nstore new. Every lady should use the wonderful enamel for the\r\nfollowing reasons: It enables an ordinary ironer to compete with any\r\nlaundry; it makes the clothes clear and white; it makes clothes iron\r\nsmoothly, and prevents the iron sticking; it makes old linen look\r\nlike new; and it saves a woman many hours' hard work each week. It is\r\neasily made, and five cents' worth will last an ordinary family six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n_Recipe:_ Melt half a pound of refined paraffine wax in a tin pan over\r\na slow fire. When melted remove from the fire and add twenty drops of\r\noil of citronella. Take a tin pan and oil with sweet oil, put the pan\r\non a level table, and pour in enough of the hot wax to make a depth of\r\nan eighth of an inch. When cool, but not cold, cut in pieces about the\r\nsize of an ordinary candy lozenge. Lay them aside to cool, but do not\r\nlet them touch each other.\r\n\r\n_Directions for use:_ To a pint of boiling starch stir in one cake.\r\nUse starch while warm.\r\n\r\nNo. 6 is\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ROYAL WASHING POWDER\r\n\r\n--the laundress' assistant; warranted not to injure the finest fabric.\r\nNo acid; no potash. In the wash room it saves time, labor, expense,\r\nmuscle, temper, and hands. The clothes will come out cleaned and\r\nwhite, without wear or tear or rubbing on washboards, therefore will\r\nlast twice as long. For housecleaning it is unequaled. One girl can\r\nwash more clothes, paint, walls, windows or floors in a day with\r\nperfect ease with this powder than she could in four days with hard\r\nlabor, soap, and scrubbing brush, and the paint will look new and\r\nbright. It only requires to be tested to be appreciated. Packages of\r\none pound will only cost seven cents.\r\n\r\n_Recipe:_ Mix any quantity of soda ash with an equal quantity of\r\ncarbonate of soda crushed into coarse grains. Have a thin solution of\r\nglue or decoction of linseed oil ready, into which pour the soda until\r\nquite thick. Spread out in a warm apartment to dry. When dry shake up\r\nwell and pack away for use. Use as other washing powders.\r\n\r\nNo. 7 is\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MAGIC ANNIHILATOR.\r\n\r\nRemoves all kinds of grease and oil spots from every kind of\r\nwearing-apparel--such as coats, pants, vests, dress goods, carpets,\r\netc.--without injury to the finest silks or laces. It will shampoo\r\nlike a charm, raising the lather in proportion to the amount of\r\ndandruff and grease in the hair. A cloth wet with it will remove all\r\ngrease from door knobs, window sills, etc., handled by kitchen\r\ndomestics in their daily round of kitchen work. For cleaning silver,\r\nbrass, and copper ware it cannot be beaten. It is certain death to\r\nbedbugs, for they will never stop after they have encountered the\r\nMagic Annihilator. It is useful for many other things. A quart bottle\r\ncosts about ten cents.\r\n\r\n_Recipe:_ To make half a gallon, take aqua ammonia, one pint; soft\r\nwater, one-half gallon; best white soap, one-half pound; saltpetre,\r\none ounce. Shave the soap fine, add the water, boil until the soap is\r\ndissolved, then add the saltpetre, stirring until dissolved. Now\r\nstrain, let the suds settle, skim off the dry suds, add the ammonia,\r\nand bottle and cork at once.\r\n\r\n_Directions for use:_ For grease spots, pour upon the article to be\r\ncleaned a sufficient quantity of the Magic Annihilator, rubbing well\r\nwith a clean sponge and applying to both sides of the article. Upon\r\ncarpets and coarse goods where the grease is hard and dry use a stiff\r\nbrush and wash out with clear cold water. For shampooing, take a small\r\nquantity, with an equal quantity of water; apply to the hair with a\r\nstiff brush, brushing into the scalp, and wash out with clear water.\r\nFor killing bedbugs, apply to the places they frequent.\r\n\r\nNo. 8 is\r\n\r\n\r\n                         I X L BAKING POWDER.\r\n\r\nAn unsurpassed article. Can be relied on for strength and purity. So\r\nmany of the baking powders sold contain injurious substances and are\r\naltogether unreliable. This powder can be relied on for strength and\r\npurity.

Buy the articles from a druggist.\r\n\r\n_Directions for use:_ For biscuits, pie crust, johnnycake, etc., use\r\nthree teaspoonfuls to one quart of flour or meal; for cakes, two\r\nteaspoonfuls to a teacup of flour.

Much hard work is saved, as no brushing is\r\nrequired. To make a quart vessel full will only cost about twenty\r\ncents.\r\n\r\n_Recipe:_ Mix half a pint of the best vinegar with a quarter pint of\r\nsoft water; stir into it one ounce of glue (broken up), two ounces\r\nlog-wood chips, one-sixteenth ounce of finely-powdered indigo,\r\none-sixteenth ounce of the best soft soap, one-sixteenth ounce of\r\nisinglass. Put the mixture over the fire, let it boil ten minutes or\r\nmore; then strain, bottle and cork. When cold it is fit for use.

It is palatable and luxurious. All persons are more or less\r\naware that honey should be used in every household, and it would be so\r\nif every family could have it at a very moderate price. As a\r\nhealth-establishing nutriment in the chamber of the invalid, and as a\r\ndelicious luxury for the well, honey cannot be too highly recommended.\r\nAny one using this honey regularly will find that he is strengthened\r\nand refreshed by it. He will have greater energy and if at all\r\ninclined to dyspepsia will find himself greatly helped. This honey\r\ncosts but eight cents per pound to prepare, and our directions are so\r\nsimple a child ten years old can follow them.\r\n\r\n_Recipe:_ Take two ounces of slippery elm bark and put into three\r\nquarts of warm water and let it stand four hours; strain and add eight\r\npounds of white sugar; boil four minutes; then add one pound of bee\r\nhoney while hot. Flavor with a drop of the oil of peppermint and a\r\ndrop of the oil of rose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAny lady will readily see what a saving the possession of the above\r\nrecipes may cause in her household expense. Thus, you can get a ten\r\ncent box of stove polish for three cents, a twenty-five cent package\r\nof washing powder for seven cents, a twenty-five cent box of starch\r\nenamel for five cents, etc. Any of the articles contained in the list\r\nwill take but a short time to prepare a large supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     POISONS AND THEIR ANTIDOTES.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do in a case of poisoning is to cause the ejection\r\nof the poison by vomiting. To do this, place mustard mixed with salt\r\non the tongue and give large quantities of lukewarm water; or, tickle\r\nthe throat with a feather. These failing, instantly resort to active\r\nemetics, like tartar emetic, sulphate of copper or sulphate of zinc.\r\nAfter vomiting has taken place with these, aid it, if possible, by\r\ncopious draughts of warm water until the poison is entirely removed.\r\nOf course, if vomiting cannot be induced the stomach pump must be\r\nemployed, especially if arsenic or narcotics have been taken. The\r\nfollowing table may be useful for emergencies:--\r\n\r\n    POISONS.

No\r\nmore wrinkles, crow's-feet or sallowness.\r\n\r\nTurkish Lotion completely cures freckles, pimples, blackheads, moles\r\nand superfluous hair, tan, greasy skin, blotches, redness, sore or\r\nchapped lips, chapped and red, rough hands; and, best of all,\r\ncompletely eradicates and prevents wrinkles, crow's-feet, and\r\nsallowness.\r\n\r\nTurkish Lotion creates a perfect complexion.\r\n\r\nAfter using Turkish Lotion for a short time a lady's skin will be as\r\nexquisitely soft and velvety, as clear and pure, as that of a little\r\nchild. It is not an artificial cosmetic, but a cleansing, refining,\r\nwhitening tonic. It feeds and nourishes the skin, preventing and\r\nbanishing wrinkles, crow's-feet, and sallowness. It is perfectly\r\nharmless and composed of the purest ingredients.\r\n\r\nTurkish Lotion is invaluable to every lady. It conceals the evidences\r\nof age. By its use a lady of middle-age will have the charming, fresh\r\nlook of a girl.

By using this lotion\r\naccording to directions every lady may have a fresh, rosy tinted\r\ncomplexion of exquisite pearly fairness, free from wrinkles,\r\ncrow's-feet, and sallowness.\r\n\r\nOne application will make the most stubbornly red and rough hands\r\nbeautifully soft and white.\r\n\r\nTurkish Lotion is not a paint or powder, but a new and great\r\ndiscovery--a cleansing, healing, whitening tonic that causes the cheek\r\nto glow with healthy action of the skin, and the neck, arms and hands\r\nto assume an exquisite pearly whiteness. By its use all redness and\r\nroughness is prevented and the skin is beautified and rendered soft,\r\nsmooth, and white, thereby imparting a delicate, refined loveliness\r\nimpossible to describe. Any lady using Turkish Lotion will present a\r\nfresh, youthful, natural appearance, with a pearly, rose-tinted\r\ncomplexion that is positively bewitching.

By moistening at night with this wash the\r\nparts affected, all soreness and roughness will be completely cured\r\nand the face and hands will be as delicately soft and smooth as those\r\nof a little child.\r\n\r\nNo one need suffer any longer from any defect of the skin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Recipe for Turkish Lotion:_ To one fluid ounce of tincture of gum\r\nbenzoin add seven fluid ounces of distilled rose-water and one-half\r\nounce of glycerine.\r\n\r\n_Directions for use:_ Bathe face, neck, and hands with Turkish Lotion\r\nat night, letting it dry on. Wash off in the morning with a very\r\nlittle pure white castile soap and soft water. If the water is hard,\r\nadd a very little dissolved borax. This will prevent and cure greasy\r\nskin, freckles, tan, wrinkles, pimples, blackheads, crow's-feet,\r\nblotches, sunburn, chapped hands, sore lips, rough skin, etc.\r\n\r\n_To Cure Sallowness:_ Use as above directed, and ask your druggist for\r\nsome good iron tablets. Take as directed. In a short time your\r\ncomplexion will be beautifully white and rose-tinted.\r\n\r\n_To Remove Hairy Moles and Superfluous Hair:_ Procure prepared pumice\r\nstone from your druggist; cut the hair as close as possible to the\r\nskin, dip the pumice in cold water and rub on the part on which the\r\nhairs grow, commencing gently at first (as it may cause slight\r\nirritation of the skin), then gradually increase the friction. After\r\nusing the pumice stone, anoint freely each time with Turkish Lotion.\r\nDo this twice daily, and it will surely remove superfluous hair.\r\n\r\nAlways, after using Turkish Lotion, rub gently with the hands until\r\nthe skin becomes dry. This will remove and prevent wrinkles and\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        PAGE.\r\nAlmond paste
