These were to be designated as the Mrs. Hepsa Ely\r\nSilliman Memorial Lectures. It was the belief of the testator that any\r\norderly presentation of the facts of nature or history contributed\r\nto the end of this foundation more effectively than any attempt to\r\nemphasize the elements of doctrine or of creed; and he therefore\r\nprovided that lectures on dogmatic or polemical theology should be\r\nexcluded from the scope of this foundation, and that the subjects should\r\nbe selected rather from the domains of natural science and history,\r\ngiving special prominence to astronomy, chemistry, geology and anatomy.\r\n\r\nIt was further directed that each annual course should be made the basis\r\nof a volume to form part of a series constituting a memorial to Mrs.\r\nSilliman. The memorial fund came into the possession of the Corporation\r\nof Yale University in the year 1901; and the present volume constitutes\r\nthe tenth of the series of memorial lectures.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nChapter I.

The Rise of Preventive Medicine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTHE manuscript of Sir William Osler's lectures on the \"Evolution of\r\nModern Medicine,\" delivered at Yale University in April, 1913, on the\r\nSilliman Foundation, was immediately turned in to the Yale University\r\nPress for publication. Duly set in type, proofs in galley form had been\r\nsubmitted to him and despite countless interruptions he had already\r\ncorrected and revised a number of the galleys when the great war came.\r\nBut with the war on, he threw himself with energy and devotion into\r\nthe military and public duties which devolved upon him and so never\r\ncompleted his proof-reading and intended alterations. The careful\r\ncorrections which Sir William made in the earlier galleys show that the\r\nlectures were dictated, in the first instance, as loose memoranda for\r\noral delivery rather than as finished compositions for the eye, while\r\nmaintaining throughout the logical continuity and the engaging con moto\r\nwhich were so characteristic of his literary style. In revising the\r\nlectures for publication, therefore, the editors have merely endeavored\r\nto carry out, with care and befitting reverence, the indications\r\nsupplied in the earlier galleys by Sir William himself. In supplying\r\ndates and references which were lacking, his preferences as to editions\r\nand readings have been borne in mind. The slight alterations made, the\r\nadaptation of the text to the eye, detract nothing from the original\r\nfreshness of the work.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to one of the editors, Osler described these lectures as \"an\r\naeroplane flight over the progress of medicine through the ages.\" They\r\nare, in effect, a sweeping panoramic survey of the whole vast field,\r\ncovering wide areas at a rapid pace, yet with an extraordinary variety\r\nof detail. The slow, painful character of the evolution of medicine from\r\nthe fearsome, superstitious mental complex of primitive man, with his\r\namulets, healing gods and disease demons, to the ideal of a clear-eyed\r\nrationalism is traced with faith and a serene sense of continuity. The\r\nauthor saw clearly and felt deeply that the men who have made an idea or\r\ndiscovery viable and valuable to humanity are the deserving men; he\r\nhas made the great names shine out, without any depreciation of the\r\nimportant work of lesser men and without cluttering up his narrative\r\nwith the tedious prehistory of great discoveries or with shrill claims\r\nto priority. Of his skill in differentiating the sundry \"strains\"\r\nof medicine, there is specific witness in each section. Osler's wide\r\nculture and control of the best available literature of his subject\r\npermitted him to range the ampler aether of Greek medicine or the\r\nearth-fettered schools of today with equal mastery; there is no quickset\r\nof pedantry between the author and the reader. The illustrations (which\r\nhe had doubtless planned as fully for the last as for the earlier\r\nchapters) are as he left them; save that, lacking legends, these have\r\nbeen supplied and a few which could not be identified have with regret\r\nbeen omitted. The original galley proofs have been revised and corrected\r\nfrom different viewpoints by Fielding H. Garrison, Harvey Cushing,\r\nEdward C. Streeter and latterly by Leonard L. Mackall (Savannah, Ga.),\r\nwhose zeal and persistence in the painstaking verification of citations\r\nand references cannot be too highly commended.\r\n\r\nIn the present revision, a number of important corrections, most of\r\nthem based upon the original MS., have been made by Dr. W.W. Francis\r\n(Oxford), Dr. Charles Singer (London), Dr. E.C. Streeter, Mr. L.L.\r\nMackall and others.\r\n\r\nThis work, composed originally for a lay audience and for popular\r\nconsumption, will be to the aspiring medical student and the hardworking\r\npractitioner a lift into the blue, an inspiring vista or \"Pisgah-sight\"\r\nof the evolution of medicine, a realization of what devotion,\r\nperseverance, valor and ability on the part of physicians have\r\ncontributed to this progress, and of the creditable part which our\r\nprofession has played in the general development of science.\r\n\r\nThe editors have no hesitation in presenting these lectures to the\r\nprofession and to the reading public as one of the most characteristic\r\nproductions of the best-balanced, best-equipped, most sagacious and most\r\nlovable of all modern physicians.\r\n\r\nF.H.G.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT on that account, I say, we ought not to reject the ancient Art, as\r\nif it were not, and had not been properly founded, because it did\r\nnot attain accuracy in all things, but rather, since it is capable of\r\nreaching to the greatest exactitude by reasoning, to receive it and\r\nadmire its discoveries, made from a state of great ignorance, and as\r\nhaving been well and properly made, and not from chance. (Hippocrates,\r\nOn Ancient Medicine, Adams edition, Vol. 1, 1849, p. 168.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE true and lawful goal of the sciences is none other than this: that\r\nhuman life be endowed with new discoveries and powers. (Francis Bacon,\r\nNovum Organum, Aphorisms, LXXXI, Spedding's translation.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA GOLDEN thread has run throughout the history of the world, consecutive\r\nand continuous, the work of the best men in successive ages. From point\r\nto point it still runs, and when near you feel it as the clear and\r\nbright and searchingly irresistible light which Truth throws forth when\r\ngreat minds conceive it. (Walter Moxon, Pilocereus Senilis and Other\r\nPapers, 1887, p. 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR the mind depends so much on the temperament and disposition of the\r\nbodily organs that, if it is possible to find a means of rendering men\r\nwiser and cleverer than they have hitherto been, I believe that it is in\r\nmedicine that it must be sought. It is true that the medicine which is\r\nnow in vogue contains little of which the utility is remarkable; but,\r\nwithout having any intention of decrying it, I am sure that there is\r\nno one, even among those who make its study a profession, who does not\r\nconfess that all that men know is almost nothing in comparison with\r\nwhat remains to be known; and that we could be free of an infinitude\r\nof maladies both of body and mind, and even also possibly of the\r\ninfirmities of age, if we had sufficient knowledge of their causes,\r\nand of all the remedies with which nature has provided us. (Descartes:\r\nDiscourse on the Method, Philosophical Works. Translated by E. S.\r\nHaldane and G. R. T. Ross. Vol. I, Cam. Univ. Press, 1911, p. 120.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I -- ORIGIN OF MEDICINE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nSAIL to the Pacific with some Ancient Mariner, and traverse day by day\r\nthat silent sea until you reach a region never before furrowed by keel\r\nwhere a tiny island, a mere speck on the vast ocean, has just risen from\r\nthe depths, a little coral reef capped with green, an atoll, a mimic\r\nearth, fringed with life, built up through countless ages by life on the\r\nremains of life that has passed away. And now, with wings of fancy,\r\njoin Ianthe in the magic car of Shelley, pass the eternal gates of the\r\nflaming ramparts of the world and see his vision:\r\n\r\n     Below lay stretched the boundless Universe!\r\n     There, far as the remotest line\r\n     That limits swift imagination's flight,\r\n     Unending orbs mingled in mazy motion,\r\n     Immutably fulfilling\r\n     Eternal Nature's law.\r\n     Above, below, around,\r\n     The circling systems formed\r\n     A wilderness of harmony.\r\n     (Daemon of the World, Pt. I.)\r\n\r\nAnd somewhere, \"as fast and far the chariot flew,\" amid the mighty\r\nglobes would be seen a tiny speck, \"earth's distant orb,\" one of \"the\r\nsmallest lights that twinkle in the heavens.\" Alighting, Ianthe\r\nwould find something she had probably not seen elsewhere in her magic\r\nflight--life, everywhere encircling the sphere. And as the little coral\r\nreef out of a vast depth had been built up by generations of polyzoa,\r\nso she would see that on the earth, through illimitable ages, successive\r\ngenerations of animals and plants had left in stone their imperishable\r\nrecords: and at the top of the series she would meet the thinking,\r\nbreathing creature known as man. Infinitely little as is the architect\r\nof the atoll in proportion to the earth on which it rests, the polyzoon,\r\nI doubt not, is much larger relatively than is man in proportion to\r\nthe vast systems of the Universe, in which he represents an\r\nultra-microscopic atom less ten thousand times than the tiniest of the\r\n\"gay motes that people the sunbeams.\" Yet, with colossal audacity, this\r\nthinking atom regards himself as the anthropocentric pivot around which\r\nrevolve the eternal purposes of the Universe. Knowing not whence he\r\ncame, why he is here, or whither he is going, man feels himself of\r\nsupreme importance, and certainly is of interest--to himself. Let us\r\nhope that he has indeed a potency and importance out of all proportion\r\nto his somatic insignificance. We know of toxins of such strength that\r\nan amount too infinitesimal to be gauged may kill; and we know that\r\n\"the unit adopted in certain scientific work is the amount of emanation\r\nproduced by one million-millionth of a grain of radium, a quantity\r\nwhich itself has a volume of less than a million-millionth of a cubic\r\nmillimetre and weighs a million million times less than an exceptionally\r\ndelicate chemical balance will turn to\" (Soddy, 1912). May not man be\r\nthe radium of the Universe? At any rate let us not worry about his size.\r\nFor us he is a very potent creature, full of interest, whose mundane\r\nstory we are only beginning to unravel.\r\n\r\nCivilization is but a filmy fringe on the history of man. Go back as far\r\nas his records carry us and the story written on stone is of yesterday\r\nin comparison with the vast epochs of time which modern studies demand\r\nfor his life on the earth. For two millions (some hold even three\r\nmillions) of years man lived and moved and had his being in a world very\r\ndifferent from that upon which we look out. There appear, indeed, to\r\nhave been various types of man, some as different from us as we are\r\nfrom the anthropoid apes. What upstarts of yesterday are the Pharaohs in\r\ncomparison with the men who survived the tragedy of the glacial period!\r\nThe ancient history of man--only now beginning to be studied--dates\r\nfrom the Pliocene or Miocene period; the modern history, as we know it,\r\nembraces that brief space of time that has elapsed since the earliest\r\nEgyptian and Babylonian records were made. This has to be borne in mind\r\nin connection with the present mental status of man, particularly in his\r\noutlook upon nature. In his thoughts and in his attributes, mankind at\r\nlarge is controlled by inherited beliefs and impulses, which countless\r\nthousands of years have ingrained like instinct. Over vast regions of\r\nthe earth today, magic, amulets, charms, incantations are the chief\r\nweapons of defense against a malignant nature; and in disease, the\r\npractice of Asa(*) is comparatively novel and unusual; in days of\r\nillness many millions more still seek their gods rather than the\r\nphysicians. In an upward path man has had to work out for himself\r\na relationship with his fellows and with nature. He sought in the\r\nsupernatural an explanation of the pressing phenomena of life, peopling\r\nthe world with spiritual beings, deifying objects of nature, and\r\nassigning to them benign or malign influences, which might be invoked or\r\npropitiated. Primitive priest, physician and philosopher were one, and\r\nstruggled, on the one hand, for the recognition of certain practices\r\nforced on him by experience, and on the other, for the recognition\r\nof mystical agencies which control the dark, \"uncharted region\" about\r\nhim--to use Prof. Gilbert Murray's phrase--and were responsible for\r\neverything he could not understand, and particularly for the mysteries\r\nof disease. Pliny remarks that physic \"was early fathered upon the\r\ngods\"; and to the ordinary non-medical mind, there is still something\r\nmysterious about sickness, something outside the ordinary standard.\r\n\r\n     (*) II Chronicles xvi, 12.\r\n\r\nModern anthropologists claim that both religion and medicine took origin\r\nin magic, \"that spiritual protoplasm,\" as Miss Jane Harrison calls it.\r\nTo primitive man, magic was the setting in motion of a spiritual power\r\nto help or to hurt the individual, and early forms may still be studied\r\nin the native races. This power, or \"mana,\" as it is called, while\r\npossessed in a certain degree by all, may be increased by practice.\r\nCertain individuals come to possess it very strongly: among native\r\nAustralians today it is still deliberately cultivated. Magic in healing\r\nseeks to control the demons, or forces; causing disease; and in a way it\r\nmay be thus regarded as a \"lineal ancestor of modern science\" (Whetham),\r\nwhich, too, seeks to control certain forces, no longer, however,\r\nregarded as supernatural.\r\n\r\nPrimitive man recognized many of these superhuman agencies relating\r\nto disease, such as the spirits of the dead, either human or animal,\r\nindependent disease demons, or individuals who might act by controlling\r\nthe spirits or agencies of disease. We see this today among the negroes\r\nof the Southern States. A Hoodoo put upon a negro may, if he knows of\r\nit, work upon him so powerfully through the imagination that he becomes\r\nvery ill indeed, and only through a more powerful magic exercised by\r\nsomeone else can the Hoodoo be taken off.\r\n\r\nTo primitive man life seemed \"full of sacred presences\" (Walter Pater)\r\nconnected with objects in nature, or with incidents and epochs in life,\r\nwhich he began early to deify, so that, until a quite recent period, his\r\nstory is largely associated with a pantheon of greater and lesser\r\ngods, which he has manufactured wholesale. Xenophanes was the earliest\r\nphilosopher to recognize man's practice of making gods in his own image\r\nand endowing them with human faculties and attributes; the Thracians,\r\nhe said, made their gods blue-eyed and red-haired, the Ethiopians,\r\nsnub-nosed and black, while, if oxen and lions and horses had hands\r\nand could draw, they would represent their gods as oxen and lions and\r\nhorses. In relation to nature and to disease, all through early history\r\nwe find a pantheon full to repletion, bearing testimony no less to the\r\nfertility of man's imagination than to the hopes and fears which led\r\nhim, in his exodus from barbarism, to regard his gods as \"pillars of\r\nfire by night, and pillars of cloud by day.\"\r\n\r\nEven so late a religion as that of Numa was full of little gods to be\r\ninvoked on special occasions--Vatican, who causes the infant to utter\r\nhis first cry, Fabulinus, who prompts his first word, Cuba, who keeps\r\nhim quiet in his cot, Domiduca, who watches over one's safe home-coming\r\n(Walter Pater); and Numa believed that all diseases came from the gods\r\nand were to be averted by prayer and sacrifice. Besides the major gods,\r\nrepresentatives of Apollo, AEsculapius and Minerva, there were scores of\r\nlesser ones who could be invoked for special diseases. It is said that\r\nthe young Roman mother might appeal to no less than fourteen goddesses,\r\nfrom Juno Lucina to Prosa and Portvorta (Withington). Temples were\r\nerected to the Goddess of Fever, and she was much invoked. There is\r\nextant a touching tablet erected by a mourning mother and inscribed:\r\n\r\n     Febri divae, Febri\r\n     Sancte, Febri magnae\r\n     Camillo amato pro\r\n     Filio meld effecto. Posuit.\r\n\r\nIt is marvellous what a long line of superhuman powers, major and minor,\r\nman has invoked against sickness. In Swinburne's words:\r\n\r\n     God by God flits past in thunder till his glories turn to shades,\r\n     God by God bears wondering witness how his Gospel flames and\r\n     fades;\r\n     More was each of these, while yet they were, than man their\r\n     servant seemed;\r\n     Dead are all of these, and man survives who made them while he\r\n     dreamed.\r\n\r\n     Most of them have been benign and helpful gods.  Into the dark\r\n     chapters relating to demonical possession and to witchcraft we\r\n     cannot here enter. They make one cry out with Lucretius (Bk. V):\r\n\r\n     O genus infelix humanum, talia divis\r\n     Cum tribuit facta atque iras adjunxit acerbas!\r\n     Quantos tum gemitus ipsi sibi, quantaque nobis\r\n     Vulnera, quas lacrimas peperere minoribu' nostris.\r\n\r\nIn every age, and in every religion there has been justification for\r\nhis bitter words, \"tantum religio potuit suadere malorum\"--\"Such wrongs\r\nReligion in her train doth bring\"--yet, one outcome of \"a belief in\r\nspiritual beings\"--as Tylor defines religion--has been that man has\r\nbuilt an altar of righteousness in his heart. The comparative method\r\napplied to the study of his religious growth has shown how man's\r\nthoughts have widened in the unceasing purpose which runs through his\r\nspiritual no less than his physical evolution. Out of the spiritual\r\nprotoplasm of magic have evolved philosopher and physician, as well\r\nas priest. Magic and religion control the uncharted sphere--the\r\nsupernatural, the superhuman: science seeks to know the world, and\r\nthrough knowing, to control it. Ray Lankester remarks that Man is\r\nNature's rebel, and goes on to say: \"The mental qualities which have\r\ndeveloped in Man, though traceable in a vague and rudimentary condition\r\nin some of his animal associates, are of such an unprecedented power and\r\nso far dominate everything else in his activities as a living organism,\r\nthat they have to a very large extent, if not entirely, cut him off from\r\nthe general operation of that process of Natural Selection and survival\r\nof the fittest which up to their appearance had been the law of the\r\nliving world. They justify the view that Man forms a new departure in\r\nthe gradual unfolding of Nature's predestined scheme. Knowledge, reason,\r\nself-consciousness, will, are the attributes of Man.\"(1) It has been\r\na slow and gradual growth, and not until within the past century has\r\nscience organized knowledge--so searched out the secrets of Nature, as\r\nto control her powers, limit her scope and transform her energies. The\r\nvictory is so recent that the mental attitude of the race is not yet\r\nadapted to the change. A large proportion of our fellow creatures still\r\nregard nature as a playground for demons and spirits to be exorcised or\r\ninvoked.\r\n\r\n     (1) Sir E. Ray Lankester:  Romanes Lecture, \"Nature and Man,\"\r\n     Oxford Univ. Press, 1905, p. 21.\r\n\r\nSide by side, as substance and shadow--\"in the dark backward and abysm\r\nof time,\" in the dawn of the great civilizations of Egypt and Babylon,\r\nin the bright morning of Greece, and in the full noontide of modern\r\nlife, together have grown up these two diametrically opposite views of\r\nman's relation to nature, and more particularly of his personal relation\r\nto the agencies of disease.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this course of lectures is to sketch the main features of\r\nthe growth of these two dominant ideas, to show how they have influenced\r\nman at the different periods of his evolution, how the lamp of reason,\r\nso early lighted in his soul, burning now bright, now dim, has never,\r\neven in his darkest period, been wholly extinguished, but retrimmed\r\nand refurnished by his indomitable energies, now shines more and more\r\ntowards the perfect day. It is a glorious chapter in history, in which\r\nthose who have eyes to see may read the fulfilment of the promise of\r\nEden, that one day man should not only possess the earth, but that he\r\nshould have dominion over it! I propose to take an aeroplane flight\r\nthrough the centuries, touching only on the tall peaks from which may be\r\nhad a panoramic view of the epochs through which we pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF MEDICINE\r\n\r\nMEDICINE arose out of the primal sympathy of man with man; out of the\r\ndesire to help those in sorrow, need and sickness.\r\n\r\n     In the primal sympathy\r\n     Which having been must ever be;\r\n     In the soothing thoughts that spring\r\n     Out of human suffering.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of self-preservation, the longing to relieve a loved one,\r\nand above all, the maternal passion--for such it is--gradually softened\r\nthe hard race of man--tum genus humanum primum mollescere coepit. In\r\nhis marvellous sketch of the evolution of man, nothing illustrates more\r\nforcibly the prescience of Lucretius than the picture of the growth of\r\nsympathy: \"When with cries and gestures they taught with broken words\r\nthat 'tis right for all men to have pity on the weak.\" I heard the\r\nwell-known medical historian, the late Dr. Payne, remark that \"the basis\r\nof medicine is sympathy and the desire to help others, and whatever is\r\ndone with this end must be called medicine.\"\r\n\r\nThe first lessons came to primitive man by injuries, accidents, bites\r\nof beasts and serpents, perhaps for long ages not appreciated by his\r\nchildlike mind, but, little by little, such experiences crystallized\r\ninto useful knowledge. The experiments of nature made clear to him the\r\nrelation of cause and effect, but it is not likely, as Pliny suggests,\r\nthat he picked up his earliest knowledge from the observation of\r\ncertain practices in animals, as the natural phlebotomy of the plethoric\r\nhippopotamus, or the use of emetics from the dog, or the use of enemata\r\nfrom the ibis. On the other hand, Celsus is probably right in his\r\naccount of the origin of rational medicine. \"Some of the sick on account\r\nof their eagerness took food on the first day, some on account of\r\nloathing abstained; and the disease in those who refrained was more\r\nrelieved. Some ate during a fever, some a little before it, others after\r\nit had subsided, and those who had waited to the end did best. For the\r\nsame reason some at the beginning of an illness used a full diet, others\r\na spare, and the former were made worse. Occurring daily, such things\r\nimpressed careful men, who noted what had best helped the sick, then\r\nbegan to prescribe them. In this way medicine had its rise from\r\nthe experience of the recovery of some, of the death of others,\r\ndistinguishing the hurtful from the salutary things\" (Book I). The\r\nassociation of ideas was suggestive--the plant eyebright was used for\r\ncenturies in diseases of the eye because a black speck in the flower\r\nsuggested the pupil of the eye. The old herbals are full of similar\r\nillustrations upon which, indeed, the so-called doctrine of signatures\r\ndepends. Observation came, and with it an ever widening experience. No\r\nsociety so primitive without some evidence of the existence of a healing\r\nart, which grew with its growth, and became part of the fabric of its\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nWith primitive medicine, as such, I cannot deal, but I must refer to\r\nthe oldest existing evidence of a very extraordinary practice, that of\r\ntrephining. Neolithic skulls with disks of bone removed have been found\r\nin nearly all parts of the world. Many careful studies have been made\r\nof this procedure, particularly by the great anatomist and surgeon,\r\nPaul Broca, and M. Lucas-Championniere has covered the subject in a\r\nmonograph.(2) Broca suggests that the trephining was done by scratching\r\nor scraping, but, as Lucas-Championniere holds, it was also done by a\r\nseries of perforations made in a circle with flint instruments, and a\r\nround piece of skull in this way removed; traces of these drill-holes\r\nhave been found. The operation was done for epilepsy, infantile\r\nconvulsions, headache, and various cerebral diseases believed to be\r\ncaused by confined demons, to whom the hole gave a ready method of\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n     (2) Lucas-Championniere: Trepanation neolithique, Paris,\r\n     1912.\r\n\r\nThe practice is still extant. Lucas-Championniere saw a Kabyle thoubib\r\nwho told him that it was quite common among his tribe; he was the son of\r\na family of trephiners, and had undergone the operation four times,\r\nhis father twelve times; he had three brothers also experts; he did not\r\nconsider it a dangerous operation. He did it most frequently for pain in\r\nthe head, and occasionally for fracture.\r\n\r\nThe operation was sometimes performed upon animals. Shepherds trephined\r\nsheep for the staggers. We may say that the modern decompression\r\noperation, so much in vogue, is the oldest known surgical procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN MEDICINE\r\n\r\nOUT of the ocean of oblivion, man emerges in history in a highly\r\ncivilized state on the banks of the Nile, some sixty centuries ago.\r\nAfter millenniums of a gradual upward progress, which can be traced in\r\nthe records of the stone age, civilization springs forth Minerva-like,\r\ncomplete, and highly developed, in the Nile Valley. In this sheltered,\r\nfertile spot, neolithic man first raised himself above his kindred races\r\nof the Mediterranean basin, and it is suggested that by the accidental\r\ndiscovery of copper Egypt \"forged the instruments that raised\r\ncivilization out of the slough of the Stone Age\" (Elliot Smith). Of\r\nspecial interest to us is the fact that one of the best-known names\r\nof this earliest period is that of a physician--guide, philosopher and\r\nfriend of the king--a man in a position of wide trust and importance.\r\nOn leaving Cairo, to go up the Nile, one sees on the right in the desert\r\nbehind Memphis a terraced pyramid 190 feet in height, \"the first large\r\nstructure of stone known in history.\" It is the royal tomb of Zoser, the\r\nfirst of a long series with which the Egyptian monarchy sought \"to adorn\r\nthe coming bulk of death.\" The design of this is attributed to Imhotep,\r\nthe first figure of a physician to stand out clearly from the mists of\r\nantiquity. \"In priestly wisdom, in magic, in the formulation of wise\r\nproverbs, in medicine and architecture, this remarkable figure of\r\nZoser's reign left so notable a reputation that his name was never\r\nforgotten, and 2500 years after his death he had become a God of\r\nMedicine, in whom the Greeks, who called him Imouthes, recognized their\r\nown AEsculapius.\"(3) He became a popular god, not only healing men when\r\nalive, but taking good care of them in the journeys after death. The\r\nfacts about this medicinae primus inventor, as he has been called, may\r\nbe gathered from Kurt Sethe's study.(4) He seems to have corresponded\r\nvery much to the Greek Asklepios. As a god he is met with comparatively\r\nlate, between 700 and 332 B.C. Numerous bronze figures of him remain.\r\nThe oldest memorial mentioning him is a statue of one of his priests,\r\nAmasis (No. 14765 in the British Museum). Ptolemy V dedicated to him a\r\ntemple on the island of Philae. His cult increased much in later days,\r\nand a special temple was dedicated to him near Memphis Sethe suggests\r\nthat the cult of Imhotep gave the inspiration to the Hermetic\r\nliterature. The association of Imhotep with the famous temple at Edfu is\r\nof special interest.\r\n\r\n     (3) Breasted:  A History of the Ancient Egyptians, Scribner,\r\n     New York, 1908, p. 104.\r\n\r\n     (4) K.

For long centuries, to be learned in all\r\nthe wisdom of the Egyptians meant the possession of all knowledge. We\r\nmust come to the land of the Nile for the origin of many of man's\r\nmost distinctive and highly cherished beliefs. Not only is there a\r\nmagnificent material civilization, but in records so marvellously\r\npreserved in stone we may see, as in a glass, here clearly, there\r\ndarkly, the picture of man's search after righteousness, the earliest\r\nimpressions of his moral awakening, the beginnings of the strife\r\nin which he has always been engaged for social justice and for the\r\nrecognition of the rights of the individual. But above all, earlier and\r\nmore strongly than in any other people, was developed the faith that\r\nlooked through death, to which, to this day, the noblest of their\r\nmonuments bear an enduring testimony. With all this, it is not\r\nsurprising to find a growth in the knowledge of practical medicine; but\r\nEgyptian civilization illustrates how crude and primitive may remain a\r\nknowledge of disease when conditioned by erroneous views of its nature.\r\nAt first, the priest and physician were identified, and medicine never\r\nbecame fully dissociated from religion. Only in the later periods did\r\na special group of physicians arise who were not members of priestly\r\ncolleges.(6) Maspero states that the Egyptians believed that disease\r\nand death were not natural and inevitable, but caused by some malign\r\ninfluence which could use any agency, natural or invisible, and very\r\noften belonged to the invisible world. \"Often, though, it belongs to\r\nthe invisible world, and only reveals itself by the malignity of\r\nits attacks: it is a god, a spirit, the soul of a dead man, that has\r\ncunningly entered a living person, or that throws itself upon him\r\nwith irresistible violence. Once in possession of the body, the evil\r\ninfluence breaks the bones, sucks out the marrow, drinks the blood,\r\ngnaws the intestines and the heart and devours the flesh. The invalid\r\nperishes according to the progress of this destructive work; and death\r\nspeedily ensues, unless the evil genius can be driven out of it before\r\nit has committed irreparable damage. Whoever treats a sick person\r\nhas therefore two equally important duties to perform. He must first\r\ndiscover the nature of the spirit in possession, and, if necessary, its\r\nname, and then attack it, drive it out, or even destroy it. He can\r\nonly succeed by powerful magic, so he must be an expert in reciting\r\nincantations, and skilful in making amulets. He must then use medicine\r\n(drugs and diet) to contend with the disorders which the presence of the\r\nstrange being has produced in the body.\"(6)\r\n\r\n     (5) Maspero:  Life in Ancient Egypt and Assyria, London,\r\n     1891, p. 119.\r\n\r\n     (6) Maspero:  Life in Ancient Egypt and Assyria, London,\r\n     1891, p. 118.\r\n\r\n     (7) W. Wreszinski:  Die Medizin der alten Aegypter, Leipzig,\r\n     J. C. Hinrichs, 1909-1912.\r\n\r\nIn this way it came about that diseases were believed to be due to\r\nhostile spirits, or caused by the anger of a god, so that medicines,\r\nno matter how powerful, could only be expected to assuage the pain; but\r\nmagic alone, incantations, spells and prayers, could remove the disease.\r\nExperience brought much of the wisdom we call empirical, and the\r\nrecords, extending for thousands of years, show that the Egyptians\r\nemployed emetics, purgatives, enemata, diuretics, diaphoretics and\r\neven bleeding. They had a rich pharmacopoeia derived from the animal,\r\nvegetable and mineral kingdoms. In the later periods, specialism reached\r\na remarkable development, and Herodotus remarks that the country was\r\nfull of physicians;--\"One treats only the diseases of the eye, another\r\nthose of the head, the teeth, the abdomen, or the internal organs.\"\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of Egyptian medicine is derived largely from the\r\nremarkable papyri dealing specially with this subject. Of these, six or\r\nseven are of the first importance. The most famous is that discovered by\r\nEbers, dating from about 1500 B.C. A superb document, one of the\r\ngreat treasures of the Leipzig Library, it is 20.23 metres long and 30\r\ncentimetres high and in a state of wonderful preservation. Others are\r\nthe Kahun, Berlin, Hearst and British Museum papyri. All these have now\r\nbeen published--the last three quite recently, edited by Wreszinski.(7)\r\nI show here a reproduction from which an idea may be had of these\r\nremarkable documents. They are motley collections, filled with\r\nincantations, charms, magical formulae, symbols, prayers and\r\nprescriptions for all sorts of ailments. One is impressed by the\r\nrichness of the pharmacopoeia, and the high development which the art\r\nof pharmacy must have attained. There were gargles, salves, snuffs,\r\ninhalations, suppositories, fumigations, enemata, poultices and\r\nplasters; and they knew the use of opium, hemlock, the copper salts,\r\nsquills and castor oil. Surgery was not very highly developed, but\r\nthe knife and actual cautery were freely used. Ophthalmic surgery was\r\npracticed by specialists, and there are many prescriptions in the papyri\r\nfor ophthalmia.\r\n\r\nOne department of Egyptian medicine reached a high stage of development,\r\nvis., hygiene. Cleanliness of the dwellings, of the cities and of the\r\nperson was regulated by law, and the priests set a splendid example in\r\ntheir frequent ablutions, shaving of the entire body, and the spotless\r\ncleanliness of their clothing. As Diodorus remarks, so evenly ordered\r\nwas their whole manner of life that it was as if arranged by a learned\r\nphysician rather than by a lawgiver.\r\n\r\nTwo world-wide modes of practice found their earliest illustration in\r\nancient Egypt. Magic, the first of these, represented the attitude of\r\nprimitive man to nature, and really was his religion. He had no idea\r\nof immutable laws, but regarded the world about him as changeable and\r\nfickle like himself, and \"to make life go as he wished, he must be able\r\nto please and propitiate or to coerce these forces outside himself.\"(8)\r\n\r\n     (8) L. Thorndike:  The Place of Magic in the Intellectual\r\n     History of Europe, New York, 1905, p. 29.\r\n\r\nThe point of interest to us is that in the Pyramid Texts--\"the oldest\r\nchapter in human thinking preserved to us, the remotest reach in the\r\nintellectual history of man which we are now able to discern\"(9)--one of\r\ntheir six-fold contents relates to the practice of magic. A deep belief\r\nexisted as to its efficacy, particularly in guiding the dead, who\r\nwere said to be glorious by reason of mouths equipped with the charms,\r\nprayers and ritual of the Pyramid Texts, armed with which alone could\r\nthe soul escape the innumerable dangers and ordeals of the passage\r\nthrough another world. Man has never lost his belief in the efficacy\r\nof magic, in the widest sense of the term. Only a very few of the most\r\nintellectual nations have escaped from its shackles. Nobody else has\r\nso clearly expressed the origins and relations of magic as Pliny in\r\nhis \"Natural History.\"(10) \"Now, if a man consider the thing well,\r\nno marvaile it is that it hath continued thus in so great request and\r\nauthoritie; for it is the onely Science which seemeth to comprise in\r\nitselfe three possessions besides, which have the command and rule\r\nof mans mind above any other whatsoever. For to begin withall, no man\r\ndoubteth but that Magicke tooke root first, and proceeded from Physicke,\r\nunder the presence of maintaining health, curing, and preventing\r\ndiseases: things plausible to the world, crept and insinuated farther\r\ninto the heart of man, with a deepe conceit of some high and divine\r\nmatter therein more than ordinarie, and in comparison whereof, all\r\nother Physicke was but basely accounted. And having thus made way and\r\nentrance, the better to fortifie it selfe, and to give a goodly colour\r\nand lustre to those fair and flattering promises of things, which our\r\nnature is most given to hearken after, on goeth the habite also and\r\ncloake of religion: a point, I may tell you, that even in these daies\r\nholdeth captivate the spirit of man, and draweth away with it a greater\r\npart of the world, and nothing so much. But not content with this\r\nsuccesse and good proceeding, to gather more strength and win a\r\ngreater name, shee entermingled with medicinable receipts and religious\r\nceremonies, the skill of Astrologie and arts Mathematicall; presuming\r\nupon this, That all men by nature are very curious and desirous to know\r\ntheir future fortunes, and what shall betide them hereafter, persuading\r\nthemselves, that all such foreknowledge dependeth upon the course and\r\ninfluence of the starres, which give the truest and most certain light\r\nof things to come. Being thus wholly possessed of men, and having their\r\nsenses and understanding by this meanes fast ynough bound with three\r\nsure chains, no marvell if this art grew in processe of time to such\r\nan head, that it was and is at this day reputed by most nations of\r\nthe earth for the paragon and cheefe of all sciences: insomuch as\r\nthe mightie kings and monarchs of the Levant are altogether ruled and\r\ngoverned thereby.\"\r\n\r\n     (9) Breasted:  Development of Religion and Thought in\r\n     Ancient Egypt, New York, 1912, p. 84.\r\n\r\n     (10) The Historie of the World, commonly called the Naturall\r\n     Historie of C.

I, Sect. 1.\r\n\r\nThe second world-wide practice which finds its earliest record among\r\nthe Egyptians is the use secretions and parts of the animal body as\r\nmedicine. The practice was one of great antiquity with primitive man,\r\nbut the papyri already mentioned contain the earliest known records.\r\nSaliva, urine, bile, faeces, various parts of the body, dried and\r\npowdered, worms, insects, snakes were important ingredients in the\r\npharmacopoeia. The practice became very widespread throughout the\r\nancient world. Its extent and importance may be best gathered from\r\nchapters VII and VIII in the 28th book of Pliny's \"Natural History.\"\r\nSeveral remedies are mentioned as derived from man; others from the\r\nelephant, lion, camel, crocodile, and some seventy-nine are prepared\r\nfrom the hyaena. The practice was widely prevalent throughout the\r\nMiddle Ages, and the pharmacopoeia of the seventeenth and even of the\r\neighteenth century contains many extraordinary ingredients. \"The Royal\r\nPharmacopoeia\" of Moses Charras (London ed., 1678), the most scientific\r\nwork of the day, is full of organotherapy and directions for the\r\npreparation of medicines from the most loathsome excretions. A curious\r\nthing is that with the discoveries of the mummies a belief arose as to\r\nthe great efficacy of powdered mummy in various maladies. As Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne remarks in his \"Urn Burial\": \"Mummy has become merchandize.\r\nMizraim cures wounds, and Pharaoh is sold for balsams.\"\r\n\r\nOne formula in everyday use has come to us in a curious way from the\r\nEgyptians. In the Osiris myth, the youthful Horus loses an eye in his\r\nbattle with Set. This eye, the symbol of sacrifice, became, next to the\r\nsacred beetle, the most common talisman of the country, and all museums\r\nare rich in models of the Horus eye in glass or stone.\r\n\r\n\"When alchemy or chemistry, which had its cradle in Egypt, and derived\r\nits name from Khami, an old title for this country, passed to the hands\r\nof the Greeks, and later of the Arabs, this sign passed with it. It\r\nwas also adopted to some extent by the Gnostics of the early Christian\r\nchurch in Egypt. In a cursive form it is found in mediaeval translations\r\nof the works of Ptolemy the astrologer, as the sign of the planet\r\nJupiter. As such it was placed upon horoscopes and upon formula\r\ncontaining drugs made for administration to the body, so that the\r\nharmful properties of these drugs might be removed under the influence\r\nof the lucky planet. At present, in a slightly modified form, it still\r\nfigures at the top of prescriptions written daily in Great Britain\r\n(Rx).\"(11)\r\n\r\n     (11) John D. Comrie:  Medicine among the Assyrians and\r\n     Egyptians in 1500 B.C., Edinburgh Medical Journal, 1909, n.\r\n     s., II, 119.\r\n\r\nFor centuries Egyptian physicians had a great reputation, and in the\r\nOdyssey (Bk. IV), Polydamna, the wife of Thonis, gives medicinal plants\r\nto Helen in Egypt--\"a country producing an infinite number of drugs\r\n. . . where each physician possesses knowledge above all other men.\"\r\nJeremiah (xlvi, 11) refers to the virgin daughter of Egypt, who should\r\nin vain use many medicines. Herodotus tells that Darius had at his court\r\ncertain Egyptians, whom he reckoned the best skilled physicians in all\r\nthe world, and he makes the interesting statement that: \"Medicine is\r\npracticed among them on a plan of separation; each physician treats\r\na single disorder, and no more: thus the country swarms with medical\r\npractitioners, some under taking to cure diseases of the eye, others of\r\nthe head, others again of the teeth, others of the intestines, and some\r\nthose which are not local.\"(12)\r\n\r\n     (12) The History of Herodotus, Blakesley's ed., Bk. II, 84.\r\n\r\nA remarkable statement is made by Pliny, in the discussion upon the\r\nuse of radishes, which are said to cure a \"Phthisicke,\" or ulcer of the\r\nlungs--\"proofe whereof was found and seen in AEgypt by occasion that the\r\nKK. there, caused dead bodies to be cut up, and anatomies to be made,\r\nfor to search out the maladies whereof men died.\"(13)\r\n\r\n     (13) Pliny, Holland's translation, Bk. XIX, Chap. V, Sect.\r\n     26.\r\n\r\nThe study of the anatomy of mummies has thrown a very interesting light\r\nupon the diseases of the ancient Egyptians, one of the most prevalent\r\nof which appears to have been osteo-arthritis. This has been studied by\r\nElliot Smith, Wood Jones, Ruffer and Rietti. The majority of the lesions\r\nappear to have been the common osteo-arthritis, which involved not only\r\nthe men, but many of the pet animals kept in the temples. In a much\r\nhigher proportion apparently than in modern days, the spinal column was\r\ninvolved. It is interesting to note that the \"determinative\" of old age\r\nin hieroglyphic writing is the picture of a man afflicted with arthritis\r\ndeformans. Evidences of tuberculosis, rickets and syphilis, according to\r\nthese authors, have not been found.\r\n\r\nA study of the internal organs has been made by Ruffer, who has shown\r\nthat arterio-sclerosis with calcification was a common disease 8500\r\nyears ago; and he holds that it could not have been associated with hard\r\nwork or alcohol, for the ancient Egyptians did not drink spirits, and\r\nthey had practically the same hours of work as modern Egyptians, with\r\nevery seventh day free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASSYRIAN AND BABYLONIAN MEDICINE\r\n\r\nOF equally great importance in the evolution of medicine was the\r\npractically contemporary civilization in Mesopotamia. Science here\r\nreached a much higher stage then in the valley of the Nile. An elaborate\r\nscheme of the universe was devised, a system growing out of the\r\nDivine Will, and a recognition for the first time of a law guiding\r\nand controlling heaven and earth alike. Here, too, we find medicine\r\nancillary to religion. Disease was due to evil spirits or demons. \"These\r\n'demons'--invisible to the naked eye were the precursors of the modern\r\n'germs' and 'microbes,' while the incantations recited by the priests\r\nare the early equivalents of the physician's prescriptions. There\r\nwere different incantations for different diseases; and they were\r\nas mysterious to the masses as are the mystic formulas of the modern\r\nphysician to the bewildered, yet trusting, patient. Indeed, their\r\nmysterious character added to the power supposed to reside in the\r\nincantations for driving the demons away. Medicinal remedies accompanied\r\nthe recital of the incantations, but despite the considerable progress\r\nmade by such nations of hoary antiquity as the Egyptians and Babylonians\r\nin the diagnosis and treatment of common diseases, leading in time to\r\nthe development of an extensive pharmacology, so long as the cure\r\nof disease rested with the priests, the recital of sacred formulas,\r\ntogether with rites that may be conveniently grouped under the head of\r\nsympathetic magic, was regarded as equally essential with the taking of\r\nthe prescribed remedies.\"(14)\r\n\r\n     (14) Morris Jastrow:  The Liver in Antiquity and the\r\n     Beginnings of Anatomy.  Transactions College of Physicians,\r\n     Philadelphia, 1907, 3. s., XXIX, 117-138.\r\n\r\nThree points of interest may be referred to in connection with\r\nBabylonian medicine. Our first recorded observations on anatomy are in\r\nconnection with the art of divination--the study of the future by the\r\ninterpretation of certain signs. The student recognized two divisions\r\nof divination--the involuntary, dealing with the interpretation of signs\r\nforced upon our attention, such as the phenomena of the heavens, dreams,\r\netc., and voluntary divination, the seeking of signs, more particularly\r\nthrough the inspection of sacrificial animals. This method reached an\r\nextraordinary development among the Babylonians, and the cult spread to\r\nthe Etruscans, Hebrews, and later to the Greeks and Romans.\r\n\r\nOf all the organs inspected in a sacrificial animal the liver, from its\r\nsize, position and richness in blood, impressed the early observers as\r\nthe most important of the body. Probably on account of the richness in\r\nblood it came to be regarded as the seat of life--indeed, the seat of\r\nthe soul. From this important position the liver was not dislodged for\r\nmany centuries, and in the Galenic physiology it shared with the heart\r\nand the brain in the triple control of the natural, animal and vital\r\nspirits. Many expressions in literature indicate how persistent was this\r\nbelief. Among the Babylonians, the word \"liver\" was used in hymns and\r\nother compositions precisely as we use the word \"heart,\" and Jastrow\r\ngives a number of illustrations from Hebrew, Greek and Latin sources\r\nillustrating this usage.\r\n\r\nThe belief arose that through the inspection of this important organ in\r\nthe sacrificial animal the course of future events could be predicted.\r\n\"The life or soul, as the seat of life, in the sacrificial animal is,\r\ntherefore, the divine element in the animal, and the god in accepting\r\nthe animal, which is involved in the act of bringing it as an offering\r\nto a god, identifies himself with the animal--becomes, as it were, one\r\nwith it. The life in the animal is a reflection of his own life,\r\nand since the fate of men rests with the gods, if one can succeed in\r\nentering into the mind of a god, and thus ascertain what he purposes to\r\ndo, the key for the solution of the problem as to what the future has in\r\nstore will have been found. The liver being the centre of vitality--the\r\nseat of the mind, therefore, as well as of the emotions--it becomes in\r\nthe case of the sacrificial animal, either directly identical with the\r\nmind of the god who accepts the animal, or, at all events, a mirror in\r\nwhich the god's mind is reflected; or, to use another figure, a watch\r\nregulated to be in sympathetic and perfect accord with a second watch.\r\nIf, therefore, one can read the liver of the sacrificial animal, one\r\nenters, as it were, into the workshop of the divine will.\"(15)\r\n\r\n     (15) Morris Jastrow: loc. cit., p. 122.\r\n\r\nHepatoscopy thus became, among the Babylonians, of extraordinary\r\ncomplexity, and the organ of the sheep was studied and figured as early\r\nas 3000 B.C. In the divination rites, the lobes, the gall-bladder, the\r\nappendages of the upper lobe and the markings were all inspected with\r\nunusual care. The earliest known anatomical model, which is here shown,\r\nis the clay model of a sheep's liver with the divination text dating\r\nfrom about 2000 B.C., from which Jastrow has worked out the modern\r\nanatomical equivalents of the Babylonian terms. To reach a decision on\r\nany point, the phenomena of the inspection of the liver were carefully\r\nrecorded, and the interpretations rested on a more or less natural and\r\noriginal association of ideas. Thus, if the gall-bladder were swollen on\r\nthe right side, it pointed to an increase in the strength of the King's\r\narmy, and was favorable; if on the left side, it indicated rather\r\nsuccess of the enemy, and was unfavorable. If the bile duct was long, it\r\npointed to a long life. Gallstones are not infrequently mentioned in\r\nthe divination texts and might be favorable, or unfavorable. Various\r\ninterpretations were gathered by the scribes in the reference note-books\r\nwhich serve as guides for the interpretation of the omens and for\r\ntext-books of instructions in the temple schools (Jastrow).\r\n\r\nThe art of divination spread widely among the neighboring nations. There\r\nare many references in the Bible to the practice. The elders of Moab\r\nand Midian came to Balaam \"with the rewards of divination in their hand\"\r\n(Numbers xxii, 7). Joseph's cup of divination was found in Benjamin's\r\nsack (Genesis xliv, 5, 12); and in Ezekiel (xxi, 21) the King of Babylon\r\nstood at the parting of the way and looked in the liver. Hepatoscopy was\r\nalso practiced by the Etruscans, and from them it passed to the\r\nGreeks and the Romans, among whom it degenerated into a more or less\r\nmeaningless form. But Jastrow states that in Babylonia and Assyria,\r\nwhere for several thousand years the liver was consistently employed\r\nas the sole organ of divination, there are no traces of the rite having\r\nfallen into decay, or having been abused by the priests.\r\n\r\nIn Roman times, Philostratus gives an account of the trial of Apollonius\r\nof Tyana,(16) accused of human hepatoscopy by sacrificing a boy in\r\nthe practice of magic arts against the Emperor. \"The liver, which the\r\nexperts say is the very tripod of their art, does not consist of pure\r\nblood; for the heart retains all the uncontaminated blood, and irrigates\r\nthe whole body with it by the conduits of the arteries; whereas the\r\ngall, which is situated next the liver, is stimulated by anger and\r\ndepressed by fear into the hollows of the liver.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen how early and how widespread was the belief in amulets and\r\ncharms against the occult powers of darkness. One that has persisted\r\nwith extraordinary tenacity is the belief in the Evil Eye the power\r\nof certain individuals to injure with a look. Of general belief in the\r\nolder civilizations, and referred to in several places in the Bible,\r\nit passed to Greece and Rome, and today is still held fervently in many\r\nparts of Europe. The sign of \"le corna,\"--the first and fourth fingers\r\nextended, the others turned down and the thumb closed over them,--still\r\nused against the Evil Eye in Italy, was a mystic sign used by the Romans\r\nin the festival of Lemuralia. And we meet with the belief also in this\r\ncountry. A child with hemiplegia, at the Infirmary for Diseases of the\r\nNervous System, Philadelphia, from the central part of Pennsylvania, was\r\nbelieved by its parents to have had the Evil Eye cast upon it.\r\n\r\nThe second contribution of Babylonia and Assyria to medicine--one that\r\naffected mankind profoundly--relates to the supposed influence of the\r\nheavenly bodies upon man's welfare. A belief that the stars in their\r\ncourses fought for or against him arose early in their civilizations,\r\nand directly out of their studies on astrology and mathematics. The\r\nMacrocosm, the heavens that \"declare the glory of God,\" reflect, as in\r\na mirror, the Microcosm, the daily life of man on earth. The first step\r\nwas the identification of the sun, moon and stars with the gods of\r\nthe pantheon. Assyrian astronomical observations show an extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of practical knowledge. The movements of the sun and moon\r\nand of the planets were studied; the Assyrians knew the precession of\r\nthe equinoxes and many of the fundamental laws of astronomy, and the\r\nmodern nomenclature dates from their findings. In their days the signs\r\nof the zodiac corresponded practically with the twelve constellations\r\nwhose names they still bear, each division being represented by the\r\nsymbol of some god, as the Scorpion, the Ram, the Twins, etc. \"Changes\r\nin the heavens . . . portended changes on earth. The Biblical expression\r\n'hosts of heaven' for the starry universe admirably reflects the\r\nconception held by the Babylonian astrologers. Moon, planets and stars\r\nconstituted an army in constant activity, executing military manoeuvres\r\nwhich were the result of deliberation and which had in view a fixed\r\npurpose. It was the function of the priest--the barqu, or 'inspector,'\r\nas the astrologer as well as the 'inspector' of the liver was called--to\r\ndiscover this purpose. In order to do so, a system of interpretation was\r\nevolved, less logical and less elaborate than the system of hepatoscopy,\r\nwhich was analyzed in the preceding chapter, but nevertheless meriting\r\nattention both as an example of the pathetic yearning of men to\r\npeer into the minds of the gods, and of the influence that\r\nBabylonian-Assyrian astrology exerted throughout the ancient world\"\r\n(Jastrow).(17)\r\n\r\n     (16) Philostratus:  Apollonius of Tyana, Bk. VIII, Chap.\r\n     VII, Phillimore's transl., Oxford, 1912, II, 233.  See,\r\n     also, Justin: Apologies, edited by Louis Pautigny, Paris,\r\n     1904, p. 39.\r\n\r\n     (17) M. Jastrow:  Aspects of Religious Belief and Practice\r\n     in Babylonia and Assyria, New York, 1911, p. 210.\r\n\r\nWith the rationalizing influence of the Persians the hold of astrology\r\nweakened, and according to Jastrow it was this, in combination with\r\nHebrew and Greek modes of thought, that led the priests in the three\r\ncenturies following the Persian occupation, to exchange their profession\r\nof diviners for that of astronomers; and this, he says, marks the\r\nbeginning of the conflict between religion and science. At first an\r\nexpression of primitive \"science,\" astrology became a superstition, from\r\nwhich the human mind has not yet escaped. In contrast to divination,\r\nastrology does not seem to have made much impression on the Hebrews and\r\ndefinite references in the Bible are scanty. From Babylonia it passed to\r\nGreece (without, however, exerting any particular influence upon Greek\r\nmedicine). Our own language is rich in words of astral significance\r\nderived from the Greek, e.g., disaster.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of astrology into Europe has a passing interest.\r\nApparently the Greeks had made important advances in astronomy before\r\ncoming in contact with the Babylonians,--who, in all probability,\r\nreceived from the former a scientific conception of the universe. \"In\r\nBabylonia and Assyria we have astrology first and astronomy afterwards,\r\nin Greece we have the sequence reversed--astronomy first and astrology\r\nafterwards\" (Jastrow).(18)\r\n\r\n     (18) M. Jastrow:  Aspects of Religious Belief and Practice\r\n     in Babylonia and Assyria, New York, 1911, p. 256.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising to learn that, previous to their contact with the\r\nGreeks, astrology as relating to the individual--that is to say,\r\nthe reading of the stars to determine the conditions under which the\r\nindividual was born--had no place in the cult of the Babylonians and\r\nAssyrians. The individualistic spirit led the Greek to make his gods\r\ntake note of every action in his life, and his preordained fate might\r\nbe read in the stars.--\"A connecting link between the individual and the\r\nmovements in the heavens was found in an element which they shared in\r\ncommon. Both man and stars moved in obedience to forces from which there\r\nwas no escape. An inexorable law controlling the planets corresponded to\r\nan equally inexorable fate ordained for every individual from his birth.\r\nMan was a part of nature and subject to its laws. The thought could\r\ntherefore arise that, if the conditions in the heavens were studied\r\nunder which a man was born, that man's future could be determined in\r\naccord with the beliefs associated with the position of the planets\r\nrising or visible at the time of birth or, according to other views, at\r\nthe time of conception. These views take us back directly to the system\r\nof astrology developed by Babylonian baru priests. The basis on which\r\nthe modified Greek system rests is likewise the same that we have\r\nobserved in Babylonia--a correspondence between heaven and earth, but\r\nwith this important difference, that instead of the caprice of the\r\ngods we have the unalterable fate controlling the entire universe--the\r\nmovements of the heavens and the life of the individual alike\"\r\n(Jastrow).(19)\r\n\r\n     (19) Ibid., pp. 257-258.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on until the Renaissance, like a shadow, astrology\r\nfollows astronomy. Regarded as two aspects of the same subject, the one,\r\nnatural astrology, the equivalent of astronomy, was concerned with the\r\nstudy of the heavens, the other, judicial astrology, was concerned with\r\nthe casting of horoscopes, and reading in the stars the fate of the\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, Greek science in its palmy days seems to have been very\r\nfree from the bad features of astrology. Gilbert Murray remarks that\r\n\"astrology fell upon the Hellenistic mind as a new disease falls upon\r\nsome remote island people.\" But in the Greek conquest of the Roman mind,\r\nastrology took a prominent role. It came to Rome as part of the great\r\nHellenizing movement, and the strength of its growth may be gauged from\r\nthe edicts issued against astrologers as early as the middle of the\r\nsecond century B.C. In his introduction to his recent edition of Book II\r\nof the Astronomicon of Manilius, Garrod traces the growth of the\r\ncult, which under the Empire had an extraordinary vogue. \"Though these\r\n(heavenly) signs be far removed from us, yet does he (the god) so make\r\ntheir influences felt, that they give to nations their life and their\r\nfate and to each man his own character.\"(20) Oracles were sought on all\r\noccasions, from the planting of a tree to the mating of a horse, and the\r\ndoctrine of the stars influenced deeply all phases of popular thought\r\nand religion. The professional astrologers, as Pliny(21) says, were\r\nChaldeans, Egyptians and Greeks. The Etruscans, too, the professional\r\ndiviners of Rome, cultivated the science. Many of these \"Isiaci\r\nconjectores\" and \"astrologi de circo\" were worthless charlatans, but\r\non the whole the science seems to have attracted the attention of\r\nthoughtful men of the period. Garrod quotes the following remarkable\r\npassage from Tacitus: \"My judgment wavers,\" he says, \"I dare not say\r\nwhether it be fate and necessity immutable which governs the changing\r\ncourse of human affairs--or just chance. Among the wisest of the\r\nancients, as well as among their apes, you will find a conflict of\r\nopinion. Many hold fixedly the idea that our beginning and our end--that\r\nman himself--is nothing to the Gods at all. The wicked are in prosperity\r\nand the good meet tribulation. Others believe that Fate and the facts\r\nof this world work together. But this connection they trace not to\r\nplanetary influences but to a concatenation of natural causes. We choose\r\nour life that is free: but the choice once made, what awaits us is fixed\r\nand ordered. Good and evil are different from the vulgar opinion of\r\nthem. Often those who seem to battle with adversity are to be accounted\r\nblessed; but the many, even in their prosperity, are miserable. It needs\r\nonly to bear misfortune bravely, while the fool perishes in his wealth.\r\nOutside these rival schools stands the man in the street. No one will\r\ntake from him his conviction that at our birth are fixed for us the\r\nthings that shall be. If some things fall out differently from what was\r\nforetold, that is due to the deceit of men that speak what they know\r\nnot: calling into contempt a science to which past and present alike\r\nbear a glorious testimony\" (Ann. vi, 22).\r\n\r\n     (20) Manili Astronomicon Liber II, ed. H. W. Garrod, Oxford,\r\n     1911, p. lxix, and II, ll. 84-86.\r\n\r\n     (21) Pliny:  Natural History, Bk. XVIII, Chap. XXV, Sect.\r\n     57.\r\n\r\nCato waged war on the Greek physicians and forbade \"his uilicus all\r\nresort to haruspicem, augurem, hariolum Chaldaeum,\" but in vain; so\r\nwidespread became the belief that the great philosopher, Panaetius (who\r\ndied about 111 B.C.), and two of his friends alone among the stoics,\r\nrejected the claims of astrology as a science (Garrod). So closely\r\nrelated was the subject of mathematics that it, too, fell into\r\ndisfavor, and in the Theodosian code sentence of death was passed upon\r\nmathematicians. Long into the Middle Ages, the same unholy alliance\r\nwith astrology and divination caused mathematics to be regarded with\r\nsuspicion, and even Abelard calls it a nefarious study.\r\n\r\nThe third important feature in Babylonian medicine is the evidence\r\nafforded by the famous Hammurabi Code (circa 2000 B.C.)--a body of laws,\r\ncivil and religious, many of which relate to the medical profession.\r\nThis extraordinary document is a black diorite block 8 feet high, once\r\ncontaining 21 columns on the obverse, 16 and 28 columns on the reverse,\r\nwith 2540 lines of writing of which now 1114 remain, and surmounted by\r\nthe figure of the king receiving the law from the Sun-god. Copies of\r\nthis were set up in Babylon \"that anyone oppressed or injured, who had\r\na tale of woe to tell, might come and stand before his image, that of a\r\nking of righteousness, and there read the priceless orders of the King,\r\nand from the written monument solve his problem\" (Jastrow). From the\r\nenactments of the code we gather that the medical profession must have\r\nbeen in a highly organized state, for not only was practice regulated\r\nin detail, but a scale of fees was laid down, and penalties exacted\r\nfor malpraxis. Operations were performed, and the veterinary art was\r\nrecognized. An interesting feature, from which it is lucky that we have\r\nin these days escaped, is the application of the \"lex talionis\"--an eye\r\nfor an eye, bone for a bone, and tooth for a tooth, which is a striking\r\nfeature of the code.\r\n\r\nSome of the laws of the code may be quoted:\r\n\r\n\r\nParagraph 215. If a doctor has treated a gentleman for a severe wound\r\nwith a bronze lances and has cured the man, or has opened an abscess of\r\nthe eye for a gentleman with the bronze lances and has cured the eye of\r\nthe gentleman, he shall take ten shekels of silver.\r\n\r\n218. If the doctor has treated a gentleman for a severe wound with a\r\nlances of bronze and has caused the gentleman to die, or has opened\r\nan abscess of the eye for a gentleman and has caused the loss of the\r\ngentleman's eye, one shall cut off his hands.\r\n\r\n219. If a doctor has treated the severe wound of a slave of a poor man\r\nwith a bronze lances and has caused his death, he shall render slave for\r\nslave.\r\n\r\n220. If he has opened his abscess with a bronze lances and has made him\r\nlose his eye, he shall pay money, half his price.\r\n\r\n221. If a doctor has cured the shattered limb of a gentleman, or has\r\ncured the diseased bowel, the patient shall give five shekels of silver\r\nto the doctor.\r\n\r\n224. If a cow doctor or a sheep doctor has treated a cow or a sheep for\r\na severe wound and cured it, the owner of the cow or sheep shall give\r\none-sixth of a shekel of silver to the doctor as his fee.(22)\r\n\r\n     (22) The Oldest Code of Laws in the World; translated by C.\r\n     H. W. Johns, Edinburgh, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEBREW MEDICINE\r\n\r\nTHE medicine of the Old Testament betrays both Egyptian and Babylonian\r\ninfluences; the social hygiene is a reflex of regulations the origin\r\nof which may be traced in the Pyramid Texts and in the papyri. The\r\nregulations in the Pentateuch codes revert in part to primitive times,\r\nin part represent advanced views of hygiene. There are doubts if the\r\nPentateuch code really goes back to the days of Moses, but certainly\r\nsomeone \"learned in the wisdom of the Egyptians\" drew it up. As\r\nNeuburger briefly summarizes:\r\n\r\n\"The commands concern prophylaxis and suppression of epidemics,\r\nsuppression of venereal disease and prostitution, care of the skin,\r\nbaths, food, housing and clothing, regulation of labour, sexual life,\r\ndiscipline of the people, etc. Many of these commands, such as Sabbath\r\nrest, circumcision, laws concerning food (interdiction of blood and\r\npork), measures concerning menstruating and lying-in women and those\r\nsuffering from gonorrhoea, isolation of lepers, and hygiene of the\r\ncamp, are, in view of the conditions of the climate, surprisingly\r\nrational.\"(23)\r\n\r\n     (23) Neuburger:  History of Medicine, Oxford University\r\n     Press, 1910, Vol. I, p. 38.\r\n\r\nDivination, not very widely practiced, was borrowed, no doubt, from\r\nBabylonia. Joseph's cup was used for the purpose, and in Numbers, the\r\nelders of Balak went to Balaam with the rewards of divination in their\r\nhands. The belief in enchantments and witchcraft was universal, and the\r\nstrong enactments against witches in the Old Testament made a belief in\r\nthem almost imperative until more rational beliefs came into vogue in\r\nthe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nWhatever view we may take of it, the medicine of the New Testament is\r\nfull of interest. Divination is only referred to once in the Acts (xvi,\r\n16), where a damsel is said to be possessed of a spirit of divination\r\n\"which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.\" There is only one\r\nmention of astrology (Acts vii, 43); there are no witches, neither\r\nare there charms or incantations. The diseases mentioned are numerous:\r\ndemoniac possession, convulsions, paralysis, skin diseases,--as\r\nleprosy,--dropsy, haemorrhages, fever, fluxes, blindness and deafness.\r\nAnd the cure is simple usually a fiat of the Lord, rarely with a prayer,\r\nor with the use of means such as spittle. They are all miraculous,\r\nand the same power was granted to the apostles--\"power against unclean\r\nspirits, to cast them out, to heal all manner of sickness and all manner\r\nof disease.\" And more than this, not only the blind received their\r\nsight, the lame walked, the lepers were cleansed, the deaf heard, but\r\neven the dead were raised up. No question of the mandate. He who went\r\nabout doing good was a physician of the body as well as of the soul, and\r\ncould the rich promises of the Gospel have been fulfilled, there would\r\nhave been no need of a new dispensation of science. It may be because\r\nthe children of this world have never been able to accept its hard\r\nsayings--the insistence upon poverty, upon humility, upon peace that\r\nChristianity has lost touch no less with the practice than with the\r\nprinciples of its Founder. Yet, all through the centuries, the Church\r\nhas never wholly abandoned the claim to apostolic healing; nor is there\r\nany reason why she should. To the miraculous there should be no\r\ntime limit--only conditions have changed and nowadays to have a\r\nmountain-moving faith is not easy. Still, the possession is cherished,\r\nand it adds enormously to the spice and variety of life to know that men\r\nof great intelligence, for example, my good friend, Dr. James J. Walsh\r\nof New York, believe in the miracles of Lourdes.(24) Only a few weeks\r\nago, the Bishop of London followed with great success, it is said, the\r\npractice of St. James. It does not really concern us much--as Oriental\r\nviews of disease and its cure have had very little influence on\r\nthe evolution of scientific medicine--except in illustration of the\r\npersistence of an attitude towards disease always widely prevalent,\r\nand, indeed, increasing. Nor can we say that the medicine of our great\r\ncolleague, St. Luke, the Beloved Physician, whose praise is in the\r\nGospels, differs so fundamentally from that of the other writings of the\r\nNew Testament that we can claim for it a scientific quality. The stories\r\nof the miracles have technical terms and are in a language adorned\r\nby medical phraseology, but the mental attitude towards disease\r\nis certainly not that of a follower of Hippocrates, nor even of a\r\nscientifically trained contemporary of Dioscorides.(25)\r\n\r\n     (24) Psychotherapy, New York, 1919, p. 79, \"I am convinced\r\n     that miracles happen there. There is more than natural power\r\n     manifest.\"\r\n\r\n     (25) See Luke the Physician, by Harnack, English ed., 1907,\r\n     and W. K. Hobart, The Medical Language of St. Luke, 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINESE AND JAPANESE MEDICINE\r\n\r\nCHINESE medicine illustrates the condition at which a highly\r\nintellectual people may arrive, among whom thought and speculation were\r\nrestricted by religious prohibitions. Perhaps the chief interest in its\r\nstudy lies in the fact that we may see today the persistence of views\r\nabout disease similar to those which prevailed in ancient Egypt and\r\nBabylonia. The Chinese believe in a universal animism, all parts being\r\nanimated by gods and spectres, and devils swarm everywhere in numbers\r\nincalculable. The universe was spontaneously created by the operation\r\nof its Tao, \"composed of two souls, the Yang and the Yin; the Yang\r\nrepresents light, warmth, production, and life, as also the celestial\r\nsphere from which all those blessings emanate; the Yin is darkness,\r\ncold, death, and the earth, which, unless animated by the Yang or\r\nheaven, is dark, cold, dead. The Yang and the Yin are divided into an\r\ninfinite number of spirits respectively good and bad, called shen and\r\nkwei; every man and every living being contains a shen and a kwei,\r\ninfused at birth, and departing at death, to return to the Yang and the\r\nYin. Thus man with his dualistic soul is a microcosmos, born from the\r\nMacrocosmos spontaneously. Even every object is animated, as well as the\r\nUniverse of which it is a part.\"(26)\r\n\r\n     (26) J. J. M. de Groot:  Religious System of China, Vol. VI,\r\n     Leyden, 1910, p. 929.\r\n\r\nIn the animistic religion of China, the Wu represented a group of\r\npersons of both sexes, who wielded, with respect to the world of\r\nspirits, capacities and powers not possessed by the rest of men. Many\r\npractitioners of Wu were physicians who, in addition to charms and\r\nenchantments, used death-banishing medicinal herbs. Of great antiquity,\r\nWu-ism has changed in some ways its outward aspect, but has not altered\r\nits fundamental characters. The Wu, as exorcising physicians and\r\npractitioners of the medical art, may be traced in classical literature\r\nto the time of Confucius. In addition to charms and spells, there were\r\ncertain famous poems which were repeated, one of which, by Han Yu, of\r\nthe T'ang epoch, had an extraordinary vogue. De Groot says that the\r\n\"Ling,\" or magical power of this poem must have been enormous, seeing\r\nthat its author was a powerful mandarin, and also one of the loftiest\r\nintellects China has produced. This poetic febrifuge is translated in\r\nfull by de Groot (VI, 1054-1055), and the demon of fever, potent chiefly\r\nin the autumn, is admonished to begone to the clear and limpid waters of\r\nthe deep river.\r\n\r\nIn the High Medical College at Court, in the T'ang Dynasty, there\r\nwere four classes of Masters, attached to its two High Medical Chiefs:\r\nMasters of Medicine, of Acupuncture, of Manipulation, and two Masters\r\nfor Frustration by means of Spells.\r\n\r\nSoothsaying and exorcism may be traced far back to the fifth and sixth\r\ncenturies B.C.\r\n\r\nIn times of epidemic the specialists of Wu-ism, who act as seers,\r\nsoothsayers and exorcists, engage in processions, stripped to the waist,\r\ndancing in a frantic, delirious state, covering themselves with blood by\r\nmeans of prick-balls, or with needles thrust through their tongues, or\r\nsitting or stretching themselves on nail points or rows of sword edges.\r\nIn this way they frighten the spectres of disease. They are nearly\r\nall young, and are spoken of as \"divining youths,\" and they use an\r\nexorcising magic based on the principle that legions of spectres prone\r\nto evil live in the machine of the world. (De Groot, VI, 983-985.)\r\n\r\nThe Chinese believe that it is the Tao, or \"Order of the Universe,\"\r\nwhich affords immunity from evil, and according to whether or no the\r\nbirth occurred in a beneficent year, dominated by four double cyclical\r\ncharacters, the horoscope is \"heavy\" or \"light.\" Those with light\r\nhoroscopes are specially prone to incurable complaints, but much harm\r\ncan be averted if such an individual be surrounded with exorcising\r\nobjects, if he be given proper amulets to wear and proper medicines to\r\nswallow, and by selecting for him auspicious days and hours.\r\n\r\nTwo or three special points may be referred to. The doctrine of the\r\npulse reached such extraordinary development that the whole practice\r\nof the art centred round its different characters. There were scores\r\nof varieties, which in complication and detail put to confusion the\r\ncomplicated system of some of the old Graeco-Roman writers. The basic\r\nidea seems to have been that each part and organ had its own proper\r\npulse, and just as in a stringed instrument each chord has its own tone,\r\nso in the human body, if the pulses were in harmony, it meant health; if\r\nthere was discord, it meant disease. These Chinese views reached\r\nEurope in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and there is a very\r\nelaborate description of them in Floyer's well-known book.(27) And the\r\nidea of harmony in the pulse is met with into the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n     (27) Sir John Floyer:  The Physician's Pulse Watch, etc.,\r\n     London, 1707.\r\n\r\nOrganotherapy was as extensively practiced in China as in Egypt. Parts\r\nof organs, various secretions and excretions are very commonly used. One\r\nuseful method of practice reached a remarkable development, viz., the\r\nart of acupuncture--the thrusting of fine needles more or less deeply\r\ninto the affected part. There are some 388 spots on the body in which\r\nacupuncture could be performed, and so well had long experience taught\r\nthem as to the points of danger, that the course of the arteries may be\r\ntraced by the tracts that are avoided. The Chinese practiced inoculation\r\nfor smallpox as early as the eleventh century.\r\n\r\nEven the briefest sketch of the condition of Chinese medicine leaves the\r\nimpression of the appalling stagnation and sterility that may afflict a\r\nreally intelligent people for thousands of years. It is doubtful if they\r\nare today in a very much more advanced condition than were the Egyptians\r\nat the time when the Ebers Papyrus was written. From one point of view\r\nit is an interesting experiment, as illustrating the state in which\r\na people may remain who have no knowledge of anatomy, physiology or\r\npathology.\r\n\r\nEarly Japanese medicine has not much to distinguish it from the Chinese.\r\nAt first purely theurgic, the practice was later characterized by\r\nacupuncture and a refined study of the pulse. It has an extensive\r\nliterature, largely based upon the Chinese, and extending as far back as\r\nthe beginning of the Christian era. European medicine was introduced by\r\nthe Portuguese and the Dutch, whose \"factory\" or \"company\" physicians\r\nwere not without influence upon practice. An extraordinary stimulus was\r\ngiven to the belief in European medicine by a dissection made by\r\nMayeno in 1771 demonstrating the position of the organs as shown in\r\nthe European anatomical tables, and proving the Chinese figures to be\r\nincorrect. The next day a translation into Japanese of the anatomical\r\nwork of Kulmus was begun, and from its appearance in 1773 may be dated\r\nthe commencement of reforms in medicine. In 1793, the work of de Gorter\r\non internal medicine was translated, and it is interesting to know that\r\nbefore the so-called \"opening of Japan\" many European works on medicine\r\nhad been published. In 1857, a Dutch medical school was started in Yedo.\r\nSince the political upheaval in 1868, Japan has made rapid progress in\r\nscientific medicine, and its institutions and teachers are now among the\r\nbest known in the world.(28)\r\n\r\n     (28) See Y. Fujikawa, Geschichte der Medizin in Japan,\r\n     Tokyo, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II -- GREEK MEDICINE\r\n\r\nOGRAIAE gentis decus! let us sing with Lucretius, one of the great\r\ninterpreters of Greek thought. How grand and how true is his paean!\r\n\r\n     Out of the night, out of the blinding night\r\n     Thy beacon flashes;--hail, beloved light\r\n     Of Greece and Grecian; hail, for in the mirk\r\n     Thou cost reveal each valley and each height.\r\n\r\n     Thou art my leader, and the footprints shine,\r\n     Wherein I plant my own....\r\n\r\n     * * * * *\r\n\r\n     The world was shine to read, and having read,\r\n     Before thy children's eyes thou didst outspread\r\n     The fruitful page of knowledge, all the wealth\r\n     Of wisdom, all her plenty for their bread.\r\n\r\n     (Bk. III.--Translated by D. A. Slater.)\r\n\r\n\r\n     Let us come out of the murky night of the East, heavy with\r\n     phantoms,\r\n     into the bright daylight of the West, into the company of men\r\n     whose\r\n     thoughts made our thoughts, and whose ways made our ways--the men\r\n     who first dared to look on nature with the clear eyes of the\r\n     mind.\r\n\r\nBrowning's famous poem, \"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came,\" is an\r\nallegory of the pilgrimage of man through the dark places of the earth,\r\non a dismal path beset with demons, and strewn with the wreckage of\r\ngenerations of failures. In his ear tolled the knell of all the lost\r\nadventurers, his peers, all lost, lost within sight of the dark Tower\r\nitself--\r\n\r\n     The round squat turret, blind as the fool's heart,\r\n     Built of brown stone, without a counterpart\r\n     In the whole world.\r\n\r\nlost in despair at an all-encircling mystery. Not so the Greek Childe\r\nRoland who set the slug-horn to his lips and blew a challenge. Neither\r\nShakespeare nor Browning tells us what happened, and the old legend,\r\nChilde Roland, is the incarnation of the Greek spirit, the young,\r\nlight-hearted master of the modern world, at whose trumpet blast the\r\ndark towers of ignorance, superstition and deceit have vanished into\r\nthin air, as the baseless fabric of a dream. Not that the jeering\r\nphantoms have flown! They still beset, in varied form, the path of each\r\ngeneration; but the Achaian Childe Roland gave to man self-confidence,\r\nand taught him the lesson that nature's mysteries, to be solved, must\r\nbe challenged. On a portal of one of the temples of Isis in Egypt was\r\ncarved: \"I am whatever hath been, is, or ever will be, and my veil no\r\nman has yet lifted.\"\r\n\r\nThe veil of nature the Greek lifted and herein lies his value to us.\r\nWhat of this Genius? How did it arise among the peoples of the AEgean\r\nSea? Those who wish to know the rock whence science was hewn may read\r\nthe story told in vivid language by Professor Gomperz in his \"Greek\r\nThinkers,\" the fourth volume of which has recently been published\r\n(Murray, 1912; Scribner, 1912). In 1912, there was published a book by\r\none of the younger Oxford teachers, \"The Greek Genius and Its Meaning to\r\nUs,\"(1) from which those who shrink from the serious study of Gomperz'\r\nfour volumes may learn something of the spirit of Greece. Let me quote a\r\nfew lines from his introduction:\r\n\r\n     (1) By R. W. Livingstone, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1912 (2d\r\n     ed., revised, 1915).\r\n\r\n\"Europe has nearly four million square miles; Lancashire has 1,700;\r\nAttica has 700. Yet this tiny country has given us an art which we,\r\nwith it and all that the world has done since it for our models, have\r\nequalled perhaps, but not surpassed. It has given us the staple of our\r\nvocabulary in every domain of thought and knowledge. Politics, tyranny,\r\ndemocracy, anarchism, philosophy, physiology, geology, history--these\r\nare all Greek words. It has seized and up to the present day kept hold\r\nof our higher education. It has exercised an unfailing fascination, even\r\non minds alien or hostile. Rome took her culture thence. Young Romans\r\ncompleted their education in the Greek schools.... And so it was with\r\nnatures less akin to Greece than the Roman. St. Paul, a Hebrew of the\r\nHebrews, who called the wisdom of the Greeks foolishness, was drawn\r\nto their Areopagus, and found himself accommodating his gospel to the\r\nstyle, and quoting verses from the poets of this alien race. After him,\r\nthe Church, which was born to protest against Hellenism, translated its\r\ndogmas into the language of Greek thought and finally crystallized them\r\nin the philosophy of Aristotle.\"\r\n\r\nWhether a plaything of the gods or a cog in the wheels of the universe\r\nthis was the problem which life offered to the thinking Greek; and in\r\nundertaking its solution, he set in motion the forces that have made\r\nour modern civilization. That the problem remains unsolved is nothing\r\nin comparison with the supreme fact that in wrestling with it, and in\r\nstudying the laws of the machine, man is learning to control the\r\nsmall section of it with which he is specially concerned. The veil of\r\nthaumaturgy which shrouded the Orient, while not removed, was rent in\r\ntwain, and for the first time in history, man had a clear vision of the\r\nworld about him--\"had gazed on Nature's naked loveliness\" (\"Adonais\")\r\nunabashed and unaffrighted by the supernatural powers about him. Not\r\nthat the Greek got rid of his gods--far from it!--but he made them so\r\nlike himself, and lived on terms of such familiarity with them that they\r\ninspired no terror.(2)\r\n\r\n     (2) \"They made deities in their own image, in the likeness\r\n     of an image of corruptible man.  Sua cuique deu fit dira\r\n     cupido. 'Each man's fearful passion becomes his god.'  Yes,\r\n     and not passions only, but every impulse, every aspiration,\r\n     every humour, every virtue, every whim.  In each of his\r\n     activities the Greek found something wonderful, and called\r\n     it God: the hearth at which he warmed himself and cooked his\r\n     food, the street in which his house stood, the horse he\r\n     rode, the cattle he pastured, the wife he married, the child\r\n     that was born to him, the plague of which he died or from\r\n     which he recovered, each suggested a deity, and he made one\r\n     to preside over each. So too with qualities and powers more\r\n     abstract.\" R.W. Livingstone:  The Greek Genius and Its\r\n     Meaning to Us, pp. 51-52.\r\n\r\nLivingstone discusses the Greek Genius as displayed to us in certain\r\n\"notes\"--the Note of Beauty--the Desire for Freedom--the Note\r\nof Directness--the Note of Humanism--the Note of Sanity and of\r\nMany-sidedness. Upon some of these characteristics we shall have\r\noccasion to dwell in the brief sketch of the rise of scientific medicine\r\namong this wonderful people.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the primitive man and in the great civilizations of\r\nEgypt and Babylonia, the physician evolved from the priest--in Greece\r\nhe had a dual origin, philosophy and religion. Let us first trace the\r\norigins in the philosophers, particularly in the group known as the\r\nIonian Physiologists, whether at home or as colonists in the south of\r\nItaly, in whose work the beginnings of scientific medicine may be found.\r\nLet me quote a statement from Gomperz:\r\n\r\n\"We can trace the springs of Greek success achieved and maintained\r\nby the great men of Hellas on the field of scientific inquiry to a\r\nremarkable conjunction of natural gifts and conditions. There was the\r\nteeming wealth of constructive imagination united with the sleepless\r\ncritical spirit which shrank from no test of audacity; there was the\r\nmost powerful impulse to generalization coupled with the sharpest\r\nfaculty for descrying and distinguishing the finest shades of phenomenal\r\npeculiarity; there was the religion of Hellas, which afforded complete\r\nsatisfaction to the requirements of sentiment, and yet left the\r\nintelligence free to perform its destructive work; there were the\r\npolitical conditions of a number of rival centres of intellect, of\r\na friction of forces, excluding the possibility of stagnation, and,\r\nfinally, of an order of state and society strict enough to curb the\r\nexcesses of 'children crying for the moon,' and elastic enough not to\r\nhamper the soaring flight of superior minds.... We have already made\r\nacquaintance with two of the sources from which the spirit of criticism\r\nderived its nourishment--the metaphysical and dialectical discussions\r\npracticed by the Eleatic philosophers, and the semi-historical method\r\nwhich was applied to the myths by Hecataeus and Herodotus. A third\r\nsource is to be traced to the schools of the physicians. These aimed at\r\neliminating the arbitrary element from the view and knowledge of nature,\r\nthe beginnings of which were bound up with it in a greater or less\r\ndegree, though practically without exception and by the force of an\r\ninner necessity. A knowledge of medicine was destined to correct that\r\ndefect, and we shall mark the growth of its most precious fruits in the\r\nincreased power of observation and the counterpoise it offered to hasty\r\ngeneralizations, as well as in the confidence which learnt to reject\r\nuntenable fictions, whether produced by luxuriant imagination or by\r\na priori speculations, on the similar ground of self-reliant\r\nsense-perception.\"(3)\r\n\r\n     (3) Gomperz: Greek Thinkers, Vol. I, p. 276.\r\n\r\nThe nature philosophers of the Ionian days did not contribute much\r\nto medicine proper, but their spirit and their outlook upon nature\r\ninfluenced its students profoundly. Their bold generalizations on the\r\nnature of matter and of the elements are still the wonder of chemists.\r\nWe may trace to one of them, Anaximenes, who regarded air as the primary\r\nprinciple, the doctrine of the \"pneuma,\" or the breath of life--the\r\npsychic force which animates the body and leaves it at death--\"Our\r\nsoul being air, holds us together.\" Of another, the famous Heraclitus,\r\npossibly a physician, the existing fragments do not relate specially to\r\nmedicine; but to the philosopher of fire may be traced the doctrine of\r\nheat and moisture, and their antitheses, which influenced practice\r\nfor many centuries. There is evidence in the Hippocratic treatise peri\r\nsarkwn of an attempt to apply this doctrine to the human body. The\r\nfamous expression, panta rhei,--\"all things are flowing,\"--expresses\r\nthe incessant flux in which he believed and in which we know all matter\r\nexists. No one has said a ruder thing of the profession, for an extant\r\nfragment reads: \". . . physicians, who cut, burn, stab, and rack the\r\nsick, then complain that they do not get any adequate recompense for\r\nit.\"(4)\r\n\r\n     (4) J. Burnet:  Early Greek Philosophy, 1892, p. 137,\r\n     Bywater's no. LVIII.\r\n\r\nThe South Italian nature philosophers contributed much more to the\r\nscience of medicine, and in certain of the colonial towns there were\r\nmedical schools as early as the fifth century B.C. The most famous of\r\nthese physician philosophers was Pythagoras, whose life and work had an\r\nextraordinary influence upon medicine, particularly in connection\r\nwith his theory of numbers, and the importance of critical days. His\r\ndiscovery of the dependence of the pitch of sound on the length of the\r\nvibrating chord is one of the most fundamental in acoustics. Among the\r\nmembers of the school which he founded at Crotona were many physicians.\r\nwho carried his views far and wide throughout Magna Graecia. Nothing in\r\nhis teaching dominated medicine so much as the doctrine of numbers, the\r\nsacredness of which seems to have had an enduring fascination for the\r\nmedical mind. Many of the common diseases, such as malaria, or typhus,\r\nterminating abruptly on special days, favored this belief. How dominant\r\nit became and how persistent you may judge from the literature upon\r\ncritical days, which is rich to the middle of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nOne member of the Crotonian school, Alcmaeon, achieved great distinction\r\nin both anatomy and physiology. He first recognized the brain as the\r\norgan of the mind, and made careful dissections of the nerves, which he\r\ntraced to the brain. He described the optic nerves and the Eustachian\r\ntubes, made correct observations upon vision, and refuted the common\r\nview that the sperma came from the spinal cord. He suggested the\r\ndefinition of health as the maintenance of equilibrium, or an \"isonomy\"\r\nin the material qualities of the body. Of all the South Italian\r\nphysicians of this period, the personality of none stands out in\r\nstronger outlines than that of Empedocles of Agrigentum--physician,\r\nphysiologist, religious teacher, politician and poet. A wonder-worker,\r\nalso, and magician, he was acclaimed in the cities as an immortal god\r\nby countless thousands desiring oracles or begging the word of healing.\r\nThat he was a keen student of nature is witnessed by many recorded\r\nobservations in anatomy and physiology; he reasoned that sensations\r\ntravel by definite paths to the brain. But our attention must be\r\nconfined to his introduction of the theory of the four elements--fire,\r\nair, earth and water--of which, in varying quantities, all bodies were\r\nmade up. Health depended upon the due equilibrium of these primitive\r\nsubstances; disease was their disturbance. Corresponding to those were\r\nthe four essential qualities of heat and cold, moisture and dryness, and\r\nupon this four-fold division was engrafted by the later physicians the\r\ndoctrine of the humors which, from the days of Hippocrates almost to our\r\nown, dominated medicine. All sorts of magical powers were attributed to\r\nEmpedocles. The story of Pantheia whom he called back to life after a\r\nthirty days' trance has long clung in the imagination. You remember\r\nhow Matthew Arnold describes him in the well-known poem, \"Empedocles on\r\nEtna\"--\r\n\r\n     But his power\r\n     Swells with the swelling evil of this time,\r\n     And holds men mute to see where it will rise.\r\n     He could stay swift diseases in old days,\r\n     Chain madmen by the music of his lyre,\r\n     Cleanse to sweet airs the breath of poisonous streams,\r\n     And in the mountain-chinks inter the winds.\r\n     This he could do of old--(5)\r\n\r\na quotation which will give you an idea of some of the powers attributed\r\nto this wonder-working physician.\r\n\r\n     (5) Poetical Works of Matthew Arnold, Macmillan & Co., 1898,\r\n     p. 440.\r\n\r\nBut of no one of the men of this remarkable circle have we such definite\r\ninformation as of the Crotonian physician Democedes, whose story\r\nis given at length by Herodotus; and his story has also the great\r\nimportance of showing that, even at this early period, a well-devised\r\nscheme of public medical service existed in the Greek cities. It dates\r\nfrom the second half of the sixth century B.C.--fully two generations\r\nbefore Hippocrates. A Crotonian, Democedes by name, was found among the\r\nslaves of Oroetes. Of his fame as a physician someone had heard and he\r\nwas called in to treat the dislocated ankle of King Darius. The wily\r\nGreek, longing for his home, feared that if he confessed to a knowledge\r\nof medicine there would be no chance of escape, but under threat of\r\ntorture he undertook a treatment which proved successful. Then Herodotus\r\ntells his story--how, ill treated at home in Crotona, Democedes went to\r\nAEgina, where he set up as a physician and in the second year the State\r\nof AEgina hired his services at the price of a talent. In the third\r\nyear, the Athenians engaged him at 100 minae; and in the fourth,\r\nPolycrates of Samos at two talents. Democedes shared the misfortunes of\r\nPolycrates and was taken prisoner by Oroetes. Then Herodotus tells how\r\nhe cured Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus and wife of Darius, of a severe\r\nabscess of the breast, but on condition that she help him to escape, and\r\nshe induced her husband to send an expedition of exploration to Greece\r\nunder the guidance of Democedes, but with the instructions at all\r\ncosts to bring back the much prized physician. From Tarentum, Democedes\r\nescaped to his native city, but the Persians followed him, and it was\r\nwith the greatest difficulty that he escaped from their hands. Deprived\r\nof their guide, the Persians gave up the expedition and sailed for Asia.\r\nIn palliation of his flight, Democedes sent a message to Darius that\r\nhe was engaged to the daughter of Milo, the wrestler, who was in high\r\nrepute with the King.(6)\r\n\r\n     (6) The well-known editor of Herodotus, R. W. Macan, Master\r\n     of University College, Oxford, in his Hellenikon.  A Sheaf\r\n     of Sonnets after Herodotus (Oxford, 1898) has included a\r\n     poem which may be quoted in connection with this incident:\r\n\r\n     NOSTALGY\r\n     Atossa, child of Cyrus king of kings,\r\n     healed by Greek science of a morbid breast,\r\n     gave lord Dareios neither love nor rest\r\n     till he fulfilled her vain imaginings.\r\n     \"Sir, show our Persian folk your sceptre's wings!\r\n     Enlarge my sire's and brother's large bequest.\r\n     This learned Greek shall guide your galleys west,\r\n     and Dorian slave-girls grace our banquetings.\"\r\n     So said she, taught of that o'er-artful man,\r\n     the Italiote captive, Kroton's Demokede,\r\n     who recked not what of maladies began,\r\n     nor who in Asia and in Greece might bleed,\r\n     if he--so writes the guileless Thurian--\r\n     regained his home, and freedom of the Mede.\r\n\r\nPlato has several references to these state physicians, who were\r\nevidently elected by a public assembly: \"When the assembly meets to\r\nelect a physician,\" and the office was yearly, for in \"The Statesman\" we\r\nfind the following:(7) \"When the year of office has expired, the\r\npilot, or physician has to come before a court of review\" to answer\r\nany charges. The physician must have been in practice for some time\r\nand attained eminence, before he was deemed worthy of the post of state\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\n     (7) Jowett:  Dialogues of Plato, 3d ed., Statesman, Vol. IV,\r\n     p. 502 (Stephanus, II, 298 E)\r\n\r\n\"If you and I were physicians, and were advising one another that we\r\nwere competent to practice as state-physicians, should I not ask about\r\nyou, and would you not ask about me, Well, but how about Socrates\r\nhimself, has he good health? and was anyone else ever known to be cured\r\nby him whether slave or freeman?\"(7a)\r\n\r\n     (7a) Jowett:  Dialogues of Plato, 3d ed., Gorgias, Vol. II,\r\n     p. 407 (Stephanus, I, 514 D).\r\n\r\nAll that is known of these state physicians has been collected by\r\nPohl,(8) who has traced their evolution into Roman times. That they were\r\nsecular, independent of the AEsculapian temples, that they were well\r\npaid, that there was keen competition to get the most distinguished\r\nmen, that they were paid by a special tax and that they were much\r\nesteemed--are facts to be gleaned from Herodotus and from the\r\ninscriptions. The lapidary records, extending over 1000 years, collected\r\nby Professor Oehler(8a) of Reina, throw an important light on the state\r\nof medicine in Greece and Rome. Greek vases give representations of\r\nthese state doctors at work. Dr. E. Pottier has published one showing\r\nthe treatment of a patient in the clinic.(8b)\r\n\r\n     (8) R. Pohl:  De Graecorum medicis publicis, Berolini,\r\n     Reimer, 1905; also Janus, Harlem, 1905, X, 491-494.\r\n\r\n     (8a) J Oehler:  Janus, Harlem, 1909, XIV, 4; 111.\r\n\r\n     (8b) E.

Paris, 1906 (Fondation\r\n     Eugene Piot).\r\n\r\nThat dissections were practiced by this group of nature philosophers is\r\nshown not only by the studies of Alcmaeon, but we have evidence that one\r\nof the latest of them, Diogenes of Apollonia, must have made elaborate\r\ndissections. In the \"Historia Animalium\"(9) of Aristotle occurs his\r\naccount of the blood vessels, which is by far the most elaborate met\r\nwith in the literature until the writings of Galen. It has, too, the\r\ngreat merit of accuracy (if we bear in mind the fact that it was not\r\nuntil after Aristotle that arteries and veins were differentiated), and\r\nindications are given as to the vessels from which blood may be drawn.\r\n\r\n     (9) The Works of Aristotle, Oxford, Clarendon Press, Vol.\r\n     IV, 1910, Bk. III, Chaps. II-IV, pp. 511b-515b.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASKLEPIOS\r\n\r\nNo god made with hands, to use the scriptural phrase, had a more\r\nsuccessful \"run\" than Asklepios--for more than a thousand years the\r\nconsoler and healer of the sons of men. Shorn of his divine attributes\r\nhe remains our patron saint, our emblematic God of Healing, whose figure\r\nwith the serpents appears in our seals and charters. He was originally a\r\nThessalian chieftain, whose sons, Machaon and Podalirius, became famous\r\nphysicians and fought in the Trojan War. Nestor, you may remember,\r\ncarried off the former, declaring, in the oft-quoted phrase, that a\r\ndoctor was better worth saving than many warriors unskilled in the\r\ntreatment of wounds. Later genealogies trace his origin to Apollo,(10)\r\nas whose son he is usually regarded. \"In the wake of northern tribes\r\nthis god Aesculapius--a more majestic figure than the blameless leech\r\nof Homer's song--came by land to Epidaurus and was carried by sea to\r\nthe east-ward island of Cos.... Aesculapius grew in importance with the\r\ngrowth of Greece, but may not have attained his greatest power until\r\nGreece and Rome were one.\"(11)\r\n\r\n     (10) W. H. Roscher:  Lexikon der griechischen und romischen\r\n     Mythologie, Leipzig, 1886, I, p. 624.\r\n\r\n     (11) Louis Dyer:  Studies of the Gods in Greece, 1891, p.\r\n     221.\r\n\r\nA word on the idea of the serpent as an emblem of the healing art which\r\ngoes far back into antiquity. The mystical character of the snake, and\r\nthe natural dread and awe inspired by it, early made it a symbol of\r\nsupernatural power. There is a libation vase of Gudea, c. 2350 B.C.,\r\nfound at Telloh, now in the Louvre (probably the earliest representation\r\nof the symbol), with two serpents entwined round a staff (Jastrow, Pl.\r\n4). From the earliest times the snake has been associated with mystic\r\nand magic power, and even today, among native races, it plays a part in\r\nthe initiation of medicine men.\r\n\r\nIn Greece, the serpent became a symbol of Apollo, and prophetic\r\nserpents were kept and fed at his shrine, as well as at that of his son,\r\nAsklepios. There was an idea, too, that snakes had a knowledge of herbs,\r\nwhich is referred to in the famous poem of Nikander on Theriaka.(12) You\r\nmay remember that when Alexander, the famous quack and oracle monger,\r\ndepicted by Lucian, started out \"for revenue,\" the first thing he did\r\nwas to provide himself with two of the large, harmless, yellow snakes of\r\nAsia Minor.\r\n\r\n     (12) Lines 31, etc., and Scholia; cf. W. R. Halliday: Greek\r\n     Divination, London, 1913, p. 88.\r\n\r\nThe exact date of the introduction of the cult into Greece is not known,\r\nbut its great centres were at Epidaurus, Cos, Pergamos and Tricca. It\r\nthrove with wonderful rapidity. Asklepios became one of the most popular\r\nof the gods. By the time of Alexander it is estimated that there were\r\nbetween three and four hundred temples dedicated to him.\r\n\r\nHis worship was introduced into Rome at the time of the Great Plague at\r\nthe beginning of the third century B.C. (as told by Livy in Book XI),\r\nand the temple on the island of Tiber became a famous resort. If you can\r\ntransfer in imagination the Hot Springs of Virginia to the neighborhood\r\nof Washington, and put there a group of buildings such as are\r\nrepresented in these outlines of Caton's(13) (p. 52), add a sumptuous\r\ntheatre with seating capacity for 20,000, a stadium 600 feet long with\r\na seating capacity of 12,000, and all possible accessories of art and\r\nscience, you will have an idea of what the temple at Epidaurus, a few\r\nmiles from Athens, was. \"The cult flourished mostly in places which,\r\nthrough climatic or hygienic advantages, were natural health resorts.\r\nThose favoured spots on hill or mountain, in the shelter of forests, by\r\nrivers or springs of pure flowing water, were conducive to health. The\r\nvivifying air, the well cultivated gardens surrounding the shrine, the\r\nmagnificent view, all tended to cheer the heart with new hope of cure.\r\nMany of these temples owed their fame to mineral or merely hot springs.\r\nTo the homely altars, erected originally by sacred fountains in the\r\nneighbourhood of health-giving mineral springs, were later added\r\nmagnificent temples, pleasure-grounds for festivals, gymnasia in\r\nwhich bodily ailments were treated by physical exercises, baths and\r\ninunctions, also, as is proved by excavations, living rooms for the\r\npatients. Access to the shrine was forbidden to the unclean and the\r\nimpure, pregnant women and the mortally afflicted were kept away; no\r\ndead body could find a resting-place within the holy precincts, the\r\nshelter and the cure of the sick being undertaken by the keepers of inns\r\nand boarding-houses in the neighbourhood. The suppliants for aid had\r\nto submit to careful purification, to bathe in sea, river or spring, to\r\nfast for a prescribed time, to abjure wine and certain articles of\r\ndiet, and they were only permitted to enter the temple when they were\r\nadequately prepared by cleansing, inunction and fumigation. This lengthy\r\nand exhausting preparation, partly dietetic, partly suggestive, was\r\naccompanied by a solemn service of prayer and sacrifice, whose symbolism\r\ntended highly to excite the imagination.\"(14)\r\n\r\n     (13) Caton:  Temples and Ritual of Asklepios, 2d ed.,\r\n     London, 1900.\r\n\r\n     (14) Max Neuburger:  History of Medicine, English\r\n     translation, Oxford, 1910, p. 94.\r\n\r\nThe temples were in charge of members of the guild or fraternity, the\r\nhead of which was often, though not necessarily, a physician. The Chief\r\nwas appointed annually. From Caton's excellent sketch(15) you can get a\r\ngood idea of the ritual, but still better is the delightful description\r\ngiven in the \"Plutus\" of Aristophanes. After offering honey-cakes and\r\nbaked meats on the altar, the suppliants arranged themselves on the\r\npallets.\r\n\r\n     (15) Caton:  Temples and Ritual of Asklepios, 2d ed.,\r\n     London, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Soon the Temple servitor\r\n     Put out the lights and bade us fall asleep,\r\n     Nor stir, nor speak, whatever noise we heard.\r\n     So down we lay in orderly repose.\r\n     And I could catch no slumber, not one wink,\r\n     Struck by a nice tureen of broth which stood\r\n     A little distance from an old wife's head,\r\n     Whereto I marvellously longed to creep.\r\n     Then, glancing upwards, I beheld the priest\r\n     Whipping the cheese-cakes and figs from off\r\n     The holy table; thence he coasted round\r\n     To every altar spying what was left.\r\n     And everything he found he consecrated\r\n     Into a sort of sack--(16)\r\n\r\na procedure which reminds one of the story of \"Bel and the Dragon.\" Then\r\nthe god came, in the person of the priest, and scanned each patient.\r\nHe did not neglect physical measures, as he brayed in a mortar cloves,\r\nTenian garlic, verjuice, squills and Sphettian vinegar, with which he\r\nmade application to the eyes of the patient.\r\n\r\n     (16) Aristophanes:  B. B. Roger's translation, London, Bell\r\n     & Sons, 1907, Vol. VI, ll. 668, etc., 732 ff.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Then the God clucked,\r\n     And out there issued from the holy shrine\r\n     Two great, enormous serpents....\r\n     And underneath the scarlet cloth they crept,\r\n     And licked his eyelids, as it seemed to me;\r\n     And, mistress dear, before you could have drunk\r\n     Of wine ten goblets, Wealth arose and saw.(17)\r\n\r\n\r\n     (17) Ibid.\r\n\r\nThe incubation sleep, in which indications of cure were divinely sent,\r\nformed an important part of the ritual.\r\n\r\nThe Asklepieion, or Health Temple of Cos, recently excavated, is of\r\nspecial interest, as being at the birthplace of Hippocrates, who was\r\nhimself an Asklepiad. It is known that Cos was a great medical school.\r\nThe investigations of Professor Rudolf Hertzog have shown that this\r\ntemple was very nearly the counterpart of the temple at Epidaurus.\r\n\r\nThe AEsculapian temples may have furnished a rare field for empirical\r\nenquiry. As with our modern hospitals, the larger temple had rich\r\nlibraries, full of valuable manuscripts and records of cases. That there\r\nmay have been secular Asklepiads connected with the temple, who were\r\nfreed entirely from its superstitious practices and theurgic rites, is\r\nregarded as doubtful; yet is perhaps not so doubtful as one might think.\r\nHow often have we physicians to bow ourselves in the house of Rimmon!\r\nIt is very much the same today at Lourdes, where lay physicians have to\r\nlook after scores of patients whose faith is too weak or whose maladies\r\nare too strong to be relieved by Our Lady of this famous shrine. Even in\r\nthe Christian era, there is evidence of the association of distinguished\r\nphysicians with AEsculapian temples. I notice that in one of his\r\nanatomical treatises, Galen speaks with affection of a citizen of\r\nPergamos who has been a great benefactor of the AEsculapian temple of\r\nthat city. In \"Marius, the Epicurean,\" Pater gives a delightful sketch\r\nof one of those temple health resorts, and brings in Galen, stating that\r\nhe had himself undergone the temple sleep; but to this I can find no\r\nreference in the general index of Galen's works.\r\n\r\nFrom the votive tablets found at Epidaurus, we get a very good idea of\r\nthe nature of the cases and of the cures. A large number of them have\r\nnow been deciphered. There are evidences of various forms of diseases\r\nof the joints, affections of women, wounds, baldness, gout; but we are\r\nagain in the world of miracles, as you may judge from the following:\r\n\"Heraicus of Mytilene is bald and entreats the God to make his hair\r\ngrow. An ointment is applied over night and the next morning he has a\r\nthick crop of hair.\"\r\n\r\nThere are indications that operations were performed and abscesses\r\nopened. From one we gather that dropsy was treated in a novel way:\r\nAsklepios cuts off the patient's head, holds him up by the heels, lets\r\nthe water run out, claps on the patient's head again. Here is one of the\r\ninvocations: \"Oh, blessed Asklepios, God of Healing, it is thanks to\r\nthy skill that Diophantes hopes to be relieved from his incurable and\r\nhorrible gout, no longer to move like a crab, no longer to walk upon\r\nthorns, but to have sound feet as thou hast decreed.\"\r\n\r\nThe priests did not neglect the natural means of healing. The\r\ninscriptions show that great attention was paid to diet, exercise,\r\nmassage and bathing, and that when necessary, drugs were used. Birth and\r\ndeath were believed to defile the sacred precincts, and it was not until\r\nthe time of the Antonines that provision was made at Epidaurus for these\r\ncontingencies.\r\n\r\nOne practice of the temple was of special interest, viz., the incubation\r\nsleep, in which dreams were suggested to the patients. In the religion\r\nof Babylonia, an important part was played by the mystery of sleep, and\r\nthe interpretation of dreams; and no doubt from the East the Greeks took\r\nover the practice of divination in sleep, for in the AEsculapian\r\ncult also, the incubation sleep played a most important role. That it\r\ncontinued in later times is well indicated in the orations of Aristides,\r\nthe arch-neurasthenic of ancient history, who was a great dreamer of\r\ndreams. The oracle of Amphiaraus in Attica sent dreams into the hearts\r\nof his consultants. \"The priests take the inquirer, and keep him fasting\r\nfrom food for one day, and from wine for three days, to give him perfect\r\nspiritual lucidity to absorb the divine communication\" (Phillimore's\r\n\"Apollonius of Tyana,\" Bk. II, Ch. XXXVII). How incubation sleep was\r\ncarried into the Christian Church, its association with St. Cosmas and\r\nSt. Damian and other saints, its practice throughout the Middle Ages,\r\nand its continuation to our own time may be read in the careful study\r\nof the subject made by Miss Hamilton (now Mrs. Dickens).(18) There are\r\nstill in parts of Greece and in Asia Minor shrines at which incubation\r\nis practiced regularly, and if one may judge from the reports, with as\r\ngreat success as in Epidaurus. At one place in Britain, Christchurch\r\nin Monmouthshire, incubation was carried on till the early part of the\r\nnineteenth century. Now the profession has come back to the study\r\nof dreams,(19) and there are professors as ready to give suggestive\r\ninterpretations to them, as in the days of Aristides. As usual,\r\nAristotle seems to have said the last word on the subject: \"Even\r\nscientific physicians tell us that one should pay diligent attention to\r\ndreams, and to hold this view is reasonable also for those who are not\r\npractitioners but speculative philosophers,\"(20) but it is asking too\r\nmuch to think that the Deity would trouble to send dreams to very simple\r\npeople and to animals, if they were designed in any way to reveal the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nIn its struggle with Christianity, Paganism made its last stand in the\r\ntemples of Asklepios. The miraculous healing of the saints superseded\r\nthe cures of the heathen god, and it was wise to adopt the useful\r\npractice of his temple.\r\n\r\n     (18) Mary Hamilton:  Incubation, or the Cure of Disease in\r\n     Pagan Temples and Christian Churches, London, 1906.\r\n\r\n     (19) Freud:  The Interpretation of Dreams, translation of\r\n     third edition by A.

You will, perhaps, be surprised to\r\nhear that the only contemporary mention of Hippocrates is made by Plato.\r\nIn the \"Protagoras,\" the young Hippocrates, son of Apollodorus has\r\ncome to Protagoras, \"that mighty wise man,\" to learn the science and\r\nknowledge of human life. Socrates asked him: \"If . . . you had thought\r\nof going to Hippocrates of Cos, the Asclepiad, and were about to give\r\nhim your money, and some one had said to you, 'You are paying money to\r\nyour namesake Hippocrates, O Hippocrates; tell me, what is he that\r\nyou give him money?' how would you have answered?\" \"I should say,\" he\r\nreplied, \"that I gave money to him as a physician.\" \"And what will he\r\nmake of you?\" \"A physician,\" he said. And in the Phaedrus, in reply to\r\na question of Socrates whether the nature of the soul could be known\r\nintelligently without knowing the nature of the whole, Phaedrus replies:\r\n\"Hippocrates, the Asclepiad, says that the nature, even of the body,\r\ncan only be understood as a whole.\" (Plato, I, 311; III, 270--Jowett, I,\r\n131, 479.)\r\n\r\nSeveral lives of Hippocrates have been written. The one most frequently\r\nquoted is that of Soranus of Ephesus (not the famous physician of the\r\ntime of Trajan), and the statements which he gives are usually accepted,\r\nviz., that he was born in the island of Cos in the year 460 B.C.; that\r\nhe belonged to an Asklepiad family of distinction, that he travelled\r\nextensively, visiting Thrace, Thessaly, and various other parts of\r\nGreece; that he returned to Cos, where he became the most renowned\r\nphysician of his period, and died about 375 B.C. Aristotle mentions him\r\nbut once, calling him \"the great Hippocrates.\" Busts of him are common;\r\none of the earliest of which, and I am told the best, dating from Roman\r\ndays and now in the British Museum, is here represented.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous writings attributed to Hippocrates it cannot easily be\r\ndetermined which are really the work of the Father of Medicine himself.\r\nThey were collected at the time of the Alexandrian School, and it became\r\ncustomary to write commentaries upon them; much of the most important\r\ninformation we have about them, we derive from Galen. The earliest\r\nmanuscript is the \"Codex Laurentianus\" of Florence, dating from the\r\nninth century, a specimen page of which (thanks to Commendatore Biagi)\r\nis annexed. Those of you who are interested, and wish to have full\r\nreferences to the various works attributed to Hippocrates, will find\r\nthem in \"Die Handschriften der antiken Aerzte\" of the Prussian Academy,\r\nedited by Diels (Berlin, 1905). The Prussian Academy has undertaken the\r\neditorship of the \"Corpus Medicorum Graecorum.\" There is no complete\r\nedition of them in English. In 1849 the Deeside physician, Adams,\r\npublished (for the Old Sydenham Society) a translation of the most\r\nimportant works, a valuable edition and easily obtained. Littre's\r\nten-volume edition \"OEuvres completes d'Hippocrate,\" Paris, 1839-1861, is\r\nthe most important for reference. Those of you who want a brief but\r\nvery satisfactory account of the Hippocratic writings, with numerous\r\nextracts, will find the volume of Theodor Beck (Jena, 1907) very useful.\r\n\r\nI can only indicate, in a very brief way, the special features of the\r\nHippocratic writings that have influenced the evolution of the science\r\nand art of medicine.\r\n\r\nThe first is undoubtedly the note of humanity. In his introduction to,\r\n\"The Rise of the Greek Epic,\"(21) Gilbert Murray emphasizes the idea of\r\nservice to the community as more deeply rooted in the Greeks than in\r\nus. The question they asked about each writer was, \"Does he help to make\r\nbetter men?\" or \"Does he make life a better thing?\" Their aim was to\r\nbe useful, to be helpful, to make better men in the cities, to correct\r\nlife, \"to make gentle the life of the world.\" In this brief phrase were\r\nsummed up the aspirations of the Athenians, likewise illuminated in that\r\nremarkable saying of Prodicus (fifth century B.C.), \"That which benefits\r\nhuman life is God.\" The Greek view of man was the very antithesis of\r\nthat which St. Paul enforced upon the Christian world. One idea pervades\r\nthought from Homer to Lucian-like an aroma--pride in the body as a\r\nwhole. In the strong conviction that \"our soul in its rose mesh\" is\r\nquite as much helped by flesh as flesh by the soul the Greek sang his\r\nsong--\"For pleasant is this flesh.\" Just so far as we appreciate the\r\nvalue of the fair mind in the fair body, so far do we apprehend ideals\r\nexpressed by the Greek in every department of life. The beautiful soul\r\nharmonizing with the beautiful body was as much the glorious ideal of\r\nPlato as it was the end of the education of Aristotle. What a splendid\r\npicture in Book III of the \"Republic,\" of the day when \". . . our youth\r\nwill dwell in a land of health, amid fair sights and sounds and receive\r\nthe good in everything; and beauty, the effluence of fair works, shall\r\nflow into the eye and ear like a health-giving breeze from a purer\r\nregion, and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into likeness\r\nand sympathy with the beauty of reason.\" The glory of this zeal for\r\nthe enrichment of this present life was revealed to the Greeks as to no\r\nother people, but in respect to care for the body of the common man, we\r\nhave only seen its fulfilment in our own day, as a direct result of\r\nthe methods of research initiated by them. Everywhere throughout the\r\nHippocratic writings we find this attitude towards life, which has never\r\nbeen better expressed than in the fine phrase, \"Where there is love of\r\nhumanity there will be love of the profession.\" This is well brought\r\nout in the qualifications laid down by Hippocrates for the study of\r\nmedicine. \"Whoever is to acquire a competent knowledge of medicine ought\r\nto be possessed of the following advantages: a natural disposition;\r\ninstruction; a favourable position for the study; early tuition; love of\r\nlabour; leisure. First of all, a natural talent is required, for when\r\nnature opposes, everything else is vain; but when nature leads the way\r\nto what is most excellent, instruction in the art takes place, which\r\nthe student must try to appropriate to himself by reflection, becoming a\r\nnearly pupil in a place well adapted for instruction. He must also bring\r\nto the task a love of labour and perseverance, so that the instruction\r\ntaking root may bring forth proper and abundant fruits.\" And the\r\ndirections given for the conduct of life and for the relation which the\r\nphysician should have with the public are those of our code of ethics\r\ntoday. Consultations in doubtful cases are advised, touting for fees is\r\ndiscouraged. \"If two or more ways of medical treatment were possible,\r\nthe physician was recommended to choose the least imposing or\r\nsensational; it was an act of 'deceit' to dazzle the patient's eye by\r\nbrilliant exhibitions of skill which might very well be dispensed\r\nwith. The practice of holding public lectures in order to increase\r\nhis reputation was discouraged in the physician, and he was especially\r\nwarned against lectures tricked out with quotations from the poets.\r\nPhysicians who pretended to infallibility in detecting even the minutest\r\ndeparture from their prescriptions were laughed at; and finally,\r\nthere were precise by-laws to regulate the personal behaviour of the\r\nphysician. He was enjoined to observe the most scrupulous cleanliness,\r\nand was advised to cultivate an elegance removed from all signs of\r\nluxury, even down to the detail that he might use perfumes, but not in an\r\nimmoderate degree.\"(22) But the high-water mark of professional morality\r\nis reached in the famous Hippocratic oath, which Gomperz calls \"a\r\nmonument of the highest rank in the history of civilization.\" It is of\r\nsmall matter whether this is of Hippocratic date or not, or whether\r\nit has in it Egyptian or Indian elements: its importance lies in the\r\naccuracy with which it represents the Greek spirit. For twenty-five\r\ncenturies it has been the \"credo\" of the profession, and in many\r\nuniversities it is still the formula with which men are admitted to the\r\ndoctorate.\r\n\r\n     (21) Oxford.  Clarendon Press, 2d ed., 1911.\r\n\r\n     (22) Gomperz:  Greek Thinkers, Vol. I, p. 281.\r\n\r\nI swear by Apollo the physician and AEsculapius and Health (Hygieia) and\r\nAll-Heal (Panacea) and all the gods and goddesses, that, according to\r\nmy ability and judgment, I will keep this oath and this stipulation--to\r\nreckon him who taught me this art equally dear to me as my parents, to\r\nshare my substance with him, and relieve his necessities if required; to\r\nlook upon his offspring in the same footing as my own brothers, and\r\nto teach them this art, if they shall wish to learn it, without fee\r\nor stipulation; and that by precept, lecture, and every other mode of\r\ninstruction, I will impart a knowledge of my art to my own sons, and\r\nthose of my teachers, and to disciples bound by a stipulation and oath\r\naccording to the law of medicine, but to none others. I will follow\r\nthat system of regimen which, according to my ability and judgement, I\r\nconsider for the benefit of my patients, and abstain from whatever is\r\ndeleterious and mischievous.\r\n\r\nI will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest any such\r\ncounsel; and in like manner I will not give to a woman a pessary to\r\nproduce abortion.\r\n\r\nWith purity and with holiness I will pass my life and practice my art.\r\n\r\n(I will not cut persons labouring under the stone, but will leave this\r\nto be done by men who are practitioners of this work.)\r\n\r\nInto whatsoever houses I enter, I will go into them for the benefit\r\nof the sick, and will abstain from every voluntary act of mischief and\r\ncorruption, and, further, from the abduction of females or males,\r\nof freemen and slaves. Whatever, in connection with my professional\r\npractice, or not in connection with it, I see or hear, in the life of\r\nmen, which ought not to be spoken of abroad, I will not divulge, as\r\nreckoning that all such should be kept secret.\r\n\r\nWhile I continue to keep this Oath unviolated, may it be granted to me\r\nto enjoy life and the practice of the art, respected by all men, in all\r\ntimes! But should I trespass and violate this Oath, may the reverse be\r\nmy lot!\r\n\r\n(Adams, II, 779, cf. Littre, IV, 628.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his ideal republic, Plato put the physician low enough, in the last\r\nstratum, indeed, but he has never been more honorably placed than in\r\nthe picture of Athenian society given by this author in the \"Symposium.\"\r\nHere the physician is shown as a cultivated gentleman, mixing in the\r\nbest, if not always the most sober, society. Eryximachus, the son of\r\nAcumenus, himself a physician, plays in this famous scene a typical\r\nGreek part(22a)--a strong advocate of temperance in mind and body,\r\ndeprecating, as a physician, excess in drink, he urged that conversation\r\nshould be the order of the day and he had the honor of naming the\r\nsubject--\"Praise of the God of Love.\" Incidentally Eryximachus gives his\r\nview of the nature of disease, and shows how deeply he was influenced by\r\nthe views of Empedocles:\". . . so too in the body the good and healthy\r\nelements are to be indulged, and the bad elements and the elements of\r\ndisease are not to be indulged, but discouraged. And this is what the\r\nphysician has to do, and in this the art of medicine consists: for\r\nmedicine may be regarded generally as the knowledge of the loves\r\nand desires of the body and how to satisfy them or not; and the best\r\nphysician is he who is able to separate fair love from foul, or to\r\nconvert one into the other; and he who knows how to eradicate and how to\r\nimplant love, whichever is required, and can reconcile the most hostile\r\nelements in the constitution and make them loving friends, is a skilful\r\npractitioner.\"\r\n\r\n     (22a) Professor Gildersleeve's view of Eryximachus is less\r\n     favorable (Johns Hopkins University Circular, Baltimore,\r\n     January, 1887). Plato, III, 186--Jowett, I, 556.\r\n\r\nThe second great note in Greek medicine illustrates the directness\r\nwith which they went to the very heart of the matter. Out of mysticism,\r\nsuperstition and religious ritual the Greek went directly to nature and\r\nwas the first to grasp the conception of medicine as an art based on\r\naccurate observation, and an integral part of the science of man. What\r\ncould be more striking than the phrase in \"The Law,\" \"There are,\r\nin effect, two things, to know and to believe one knows; to know is\r\nscience; to believe one knows is ignorance\"?(23) But no single phrase in\r\nthe writings can compare for directness with the famous aphorism which\r\nhas gone into the literature of all lands: \"Life is short and Art\r\nis long; the Occasion fleeting, Experience fallacious, and Judgment\r\ndifficult.\"\r\n\r\n     (23) Littre:  OEuvres d'Hippocrate, Vol. IV, pp. 641-642.\r\n\r\nEverywhere one finds a strong, clear common sense, which refuses to\r\nbe entangled either in theological or philosophical speculations. What\r\nSocrates did for philosophy Hippocrates may be said to have done for\r\nmedicine. As Socrates devoted himself to ethics, and the application\r\nof right thinking to good conduct, so Hippocrates insisted upon the\r\npractical nature of the art, and in placing its highest good in the\r\nbenefit of the patient. Empiricism, experience, the collection of facts,\r\nthe evidence of the senses, the avoidance of philosophical speculations,\r\nwere the distinguishing features of Hippocratic medicine. One of the\r\nmost striking contributions of Hippocrates is the recognition that\r\ndiseases are only part of the processes of nature, that there is nothing\r\ndivine or sacred about them. With reference to epilepsy, which was\r\nregarded as a sacred disease, he says, \"It appears to me to be no wise\r\nmore divine nor more sacred than other diseases, but has a natural cause\r\nfrom which it originates like other affections; men regard its nature\r\nand cause as divine from ignorance.\" And in another place he remarks\r\nthat each disease has its own nature, and that no one arises without a\r\nnatural cause. He seems to have been the first to grasp the conception\r\nof the great healing powers of nature. In his long experience with the\r\ncures in the temples, he must have seen scores of instances in which the\r\ngod had worked the miracle through the vis medicatrix naturae; and\r\nto the shrewd wisdom of his practical suggestions in treatment may be\r\nattributed in large part the extraordinary vogue which the great Coan\r\nhas enjoyed for twenty-five centuries. One may appreciate the veneration\r\nwith which the Father of Medicine was regarded by the attribute \"divine\"\r\nwhich was usually attached to his name. Listen to this for directness\r\nand honesty of speech taken from the work on the joints characterized\r\nby Littre as \"the great surgical monument of antiquity\": \"I have\r\nwritten this down deliberately, believing it is valuable to learn of\r\nunsuccessful experiments, and to know the causes of their non-success.\"\r\n\r\nThe note of freedom is not less remarkable throughout the Hippocratic\r\nwritings, and it is not easy to understand how a man brought up and\r\npracticing within the precincts of a famous AEsculapian temple could\r\nhave divorced himself so wholly from the superstitions and vagaries\r\nof the cult. There are probably grounds for Pliny's suggestion that he\r\nbenefited by the receipts written in the temple, registered by the\r\nsick cured of any disease. \"Afterwards,\" Pliny goes on to remark in\r\nhis characteristic way, \"hee professed that course of Physicke which is\r\ncalled Clinice Wherby physicians found such sweetnesse that afterwards\r\nthere was no measure nor end of fees,\" ('Natural History,' XXIX, 1).\r\nThere is no reference in the Hippocratic writings to divination;\r\nincubation sleep is not often mentioned, and charms, incantations or the\r\npractice of astrology but rarely. Here and there we do find practices\r\nwhich jar upon modern feeling, but on the whole we feel in reading the\r\nHippocratic writings nearer to their spirit than to that of the Arabians\r\nor of the many writers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries A. D.\r\nAnd it is not only against the thaumaturgic powers that the Hippocratic\r\nwritings protested, but they express an equally active reaction against\r\nthe excesses and defects of the new philosophy, a point brought out very\r\nclearly by Gomperz.(24) He regards it as an undying glory of the school\r\nof Cos that after years of vague, restless speculation it introduces\r\n\"steady sedentary habits into the intellectual life of mankind.\"\r\n'Fiction to the right! Reality to the left!' was the battle-cry of this\r\nschool in the war they were the first to wage against the excesses and\r\ndefects of the nature-philosophy. Though the protest was effective in\r\ncertain directions, we shall see that the authors of the Hippocratic\r\nwritings could not entirely escape from the hypotheses of the older\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\n     (24) Gomperz:  Greek Thinkers, Vol. I, p. 296.\r\n\r\nI can do no more than indicate in the briefest possible way some of the\r\nmore important views ascribed to Hippocrates. We cannot touch upon the\r\ndisputes between the Coan and Cnidian schools.(25) You must bear in\r\nmind that the Greeks at this time had no human anatomy. Dissections\r\nwere impossible; their physiology was of the crudest character, strongly\r\ndominated by the philosophies. Empedocles regarded the four elements,\r\nfire, air, earth and water, as \"the roots of all things,\" and this\r\nbecame the corner stone in the humoral pathology of Hippocrates. As in\r\nthe Macrocosm--the world at large there were four elements, fire, air,\r\nearth, and water, so in the Microcosm--the world of man's body--there\r\nwere four humors (elements), viz.,blood, phlegm, yellow bile (or\r\ncholer) and black bile (or melancholy), and they corresponded to the four\r\nqualities of matter, heat, cold, dryness and moisture. For more than two\r\nthousand years these views prevailed. In his \"Regiment of Life\" (1546)\r\nThomas Phaer says:\". . . which humours are called ye sones of the\r\nElements because they be complexioned like the foure Elements, for like\r\nas the Ayre is hot and moyst: so is the blooud, hote and moyste. And as\r\nFyer is hote and dry: so is Cholere hote and dry. And as water is colde\r\nand moyst: so is fleume colde and moyste. And as the Earth is colde and\r\ndry: so Melancholy is colde and dry.\"(26)\r\n\r\n     (25) The student who wishes a fuller account is referred to\r\n     the histories of (a) Neuburger, Vol. 1, Oxford, 1910; (b)\r\n     Withington, London, 1894.\r\n\r\n     (26) Thomas Phaer:  Regiment of Life, London, 1546.\r\n\r\nAs the famous Regimen Sanitatis of Salernum, the popular family\r\nhand-book of the Middle Ages, says:\r\n\r\n     Foure Humours raigne within our bodies wholly,\r\n     And these compared to foure elements.(27)\r\n\r\n     (27) The Englishman's Doctor, or the Schoole of Salerne, Sir\r\n     John Harington's translation, London, 1608, p. 2.  Edited by\r\n     Francis R. Packard, New York, 1920, p. 132. Harington's book\r\n     originally appeared dated:  London 1607. (Hoe copy in the\r\n     Henry E. Huntington Library.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Littre, there is nowhere so strong a statement of these\r\nviews in the genuine works of Hippocrates, but they are found at\r\nlarge in the Hippocratic writings, and nothing can be clearer than the\r\nfollowing statement from the work \"The Nature of Man\": \"The body of\r\nman contains in itself blood and phlegm and yellow bile and black bile,\r\nwhich things are in the natural constitution of his body, and the\r\ncause of sickness and of health. He is healthy when they are in\r\nproper proportion between one another as regards mixture and force and\r\nquantity, and when they are well mingled together; he becomes sick when\r\none of these is diminished or increased in amount, or is separated in\r\nthe body from its proper mixture, and not properly mingled with all the\r\nothers.\" No words could more clearly express the views of disease which,\r\nas I mentioned, prevailed until quite recent years. The black bile,\r\nmelancholy, has given us a great word in the language, and that we have\r\nnot yet escaped from the humoral pathology of Hippocrates is witnessed\r\nby the common expression of biliousness--\"too much bile\"--or \"he has a\r\ntouch of the liver.\" The humors, imperfectly mingled, prove irritant in\r\nthe body. They are kept in due proportion by the innate heat which, by\r\na sort of internal coction gradually changes the humors to their proper\r\nproportion. Whatever may be the primary cause of the change in the\r\nhumors manifesting itself in disease, the innate heat, or as Hippocrates\r\nterms it, the nature of the body itself, tends to restore conditions to\r\nthe norm; and this change occurring suddenly, or abruptly, he calls the\r\n\"crisis,\" which is accomplished on some special day of the disease, and\r\nis often accompanied by a critical discharge, or by a drop in the body\r\ntemperature. The evil, or superabundant, humors were discharged and\r\nthis view of a special materies morbi, to be got rid of by a natural\r\nprocessor a crisis, dominated pathology until quite recently.\r\nHippocrates had a great belief in the power of nature, the vis\r\nmedicatrix naturae, to restore the normal state. A keen observer and\r\nan active practitioner, his views of disease, thus hastily sketched,\r\ndominated the profession for twenty-five centuries; indeed, echoes of\r\nhis theories are still heard in the schools, and his very words are\r\ndaily on our lips. If asked what was the great contribution to medicine\r\nof Hippocrates and his school we could answer--the art of careful\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nIn the Hippocratic writings is summed up the experience of Greece to the\r\nGolden Age of Pericles. Out of philosophy, out of abstract speculation,\r\nhad come a way of looking at nature for which the physicians were mainly\r\nresponsible, and which has changed forever men's views on disease.\r\nMedicine broke its leading strings to religion and philosophy--a\r\ntottering, though lusty, child whose fortunes we are to follow in these\r\nlectures. I have a feeling that, could we know more of the medical\r\nhistory of the older races of which I spoke in the first lecture, we\r\nmight find that this was not the first-born of Asklepios, that there\r\nhad been many premature births, many still-born offspring, even\r\nlive-births--the products of the fertilization of nature by the human\r\nmind; but the record is dark, and the infant was cast out like Israel in\r\nthe chapter of Isaiah. But the high-water mark of mental achievement\r\nhad not been reached by the great generation in which Hippocrates had\r\nlabored. Socrates had been dead sixteen years, and Plato was a man of\r\nforty-five, when far away in the north in the little town of Stagira, on\r\nthe peninsula of Mount Athos in Macedoniawas, in 384 B.C., born a \"man\r\nof men,\" the one above all others to whom the phrase of Milton may be\r\napplied. The child of an Asklepiad, Nicomachus, physician to the father\r\nof Philip, there must have been a rare conjunction of the planets at\r\nthe birth of the great Stagirite. In the first circle of the \"Inferno,\"\r\nVirgil leads Dante into a wonderful company, \"star-seated\" on the\r\nverdure (he says)--the philosophic family looking with reverence on \"the\r\nMaster of those who know\"--il maestro di color che sanno.(28) And with\r\njustice has Aristotle been so regarded for these twenty-three\r\ncenturies. No man has ever swayed such an intellectual empire--in logic,\r\nmetaphysics, rhetoric, psychology, ethics, poetry, politics and natural\r\nhistory, in all a creator, and in all still a master. The history of\r\nthe human mind--offers no parallel to his career. As the creator of\r\nthe sciences of comparative anatomy, systematic zoology, embryology,\r\nteratology, botany and physiology, his writings have an eternal\r\ninterest. They present an extraordinary accumulation of facts relating\r\nto the structure and functions of various parts of the body. It is an\r\nunceasing wonder how one man, even with a school of devoted students,\r\ncould have done so much.\r\n\r\n     (28) The \"Good collector of qualities,\" Dioscorides,\r\n     Hippocrates, Avicenna, Galen and Averroes were the medical\r\n     members of the group.  Dante, Inferno, canto iv.\r\n\r\nDissection--already practiced by Alcmaeon, Democritus, Diogenes and\r\nothers--was conducted on a large scale, but the human body was still\r\ntaboo. Aristotle confesses that the \"inward parts of man are known\r\nleast of all,\" and he had never seen the human kidneys or uterus. In his\r\nphysiology, I can refer to but one point--the pivotal question of the\r\nheart and blood vessels. To Aristotle the heart was the central organ\r\ncontrolling the circulation, the seat of vitality, the source of\r\nthe blood, the place in which it received its final elaboration and\r\nimpregnation with animal heat. The blood was contained in the heart\r\nand vessels as in a vase--hence the use of the term \"vessel.\" \"From the\r\nheart the blood-vessels extend throughout the body as in the anatomical\r\ndiagrams which are represented on the walls, for the parts lie round\r\nthese because they are formed out of them.\"(29) The nutriment oozes\r\nthrough the blood vessels and the passages in each of the parts \"like\r\nwater in unbaked pottery.\" He did not recognize any distinction between\r\narteries and veins, calling both plebes (Littre); the vena cave is the\r\ngreat vessel, and the aorta the smaller; but both contain blood. He did\r\nnot use the word \"arteria\" (arthria) for either of them. There was no\r\nmovement from the heart to the vessels but the blood was incessantly\r\ndrawn upon by the substance of the body and as unceasingly renewed by\r\nabsorption of the products of digestion, the mesenteric vessels taking\r\nup nutriment very much as the plants take theirs by the roots from the\r\nsoil. From the lungs was absorbed the pneuma, or spiritus, which was\r\nconveyed to the heart by the pulmonary vessels--one to the right,\r\nand one to the left side. These vessels in the lungs, \"through mutual\r\ncontact\" with the branches of the trachea, took in the pneuma. A point\r\nof interest is that the windpipe, or trachea, is called \"arteria,\" both\r\nby Aristotle and by Hippocrates (\"Anatomy,\" Littre, VIII, 539). It was\r\nthe air-tube, disseminating the breath through the lungs. We shall see\r\nin a few minutes how the term came to be applied to the arteries, as\r\nwe know them. The pulsation of the heart and arteries was regarded by\r\nAristotle as a sort of ebullition in which the liquids were inflated by\r\nthe vital or innate heat, the fires of which were cooled by the pneuma\r\ntaken in by the lungs and carried to the heart by the pulmonary vessels.\r\n\r\n     (29) De Generatione Animalium, Oxford translation, Bk. II,\r\n     Chap. 6, Works V, 743 a.\r\n\r\nIn Vol. IV of Gomperz' \"Greek Thinkers,\" you will find an admirable\r\ndiscussion on Aristotle as an investigator of nature, and those of\r\nyou who wish to study his natural history works more closely may do so\r\neasily--in the new translation which is in process of publication by the\r\nClarendon Press, Oxford. At the end of the chapter \"De Respiratione\" in\r\nthe \"Parva Naturalia\" (Oxford edition, 1908), we have Aristotle's\r\nattitude towards medicine expressed in a way worthy of a son of the\r\nprofession:\r\n\r\n\"But health and disease also claim the attention of the scientist, and\r\nnot merely of the physician, in so far as an account of their causes is\r\nconcerned. The extent to which these two differ and investigate diverse\r\nprovinces must not escape us, since facts show that their inquiries are,\r\nat least to a certain extent, conterminous. For physicians of culture\r\nand refinement make some mention of natural science, and claim to derive\r\ntheir principles from it, while the most accomplished investigators\r\ninto nature generally push their studies so far as to conclude with an\r\naccount of medical principles.\" (Works, III,480 b.)\r\n\r\nTheophrastus, a student of Aristotle and his successor, created the\r\nscience of botany and made possible the pharmacologists of a few\r\ncenturies later. Some of you doubtless know him in another guise--as the\r\nauthor of the golden booklet on \"Characters,\" in which \"the most eminent\r\nbotanist of antiquity observes the doings of men with the keen and\r\nunerring vision of a natural historian\" (Gomperz). In the Hippocratic\r\nwritings, there are mentioned 236 plants; in the botany of Theophrastus,\r\n455. To one trait of master and pupil I must refer--the human feeling,\r\nnot alone of man for man, but a sympathy that even claims kinship with\r\nthe animal world. \"The spirit with which he (Theophrastus) regarded the\r\nanimal world found no second expression till the present age\" (Gomperz).\r\nHalliday, however, makes the statement that Porphyry(30) goes as far as\r\nany modern humanitarian in preaching our duty towards animals.\r\n\r\n     (30) W. R. Halliday:  Greek Divination, London, Macmillan &\r\n     Co., 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDRIAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\nFROM the death of Hippocrates about the year 375 B.C. till the founding\r\nof the Alexandrian School, the physicians were engrossed largely in\r\nspeculative views, and not much real progress was made, except in the\r\nmatter of elaborating the humoral pathology. Only three or four men of\r\nthe first rank stand out in this period: Diocles the Carystian, \"both\r\nin time and reputation next and second to Hippocrates\" (Pliny), a keen\r\nanatomist and an encyclopaedic writer; but only scanty fragments of his\r\nwork remain. In some ways the most important member of this group was\r\nPraxagoras, a native of Cos, about 340 B.C. Aristotle, you remember,\r\nmade no essential distinction between arteries and veins, both of which\r\nhe held to contain blood: Praxagoras recognized that the pulsation\r\nwas only in the arteries, and maintained that only the veins contained\r\nblood, and the arteries air. As a rule the arteries are empty after\r\ndeath, and Praxagoras believed that they were filled with an aeriform\r\nfluid, a sort of pneuma, which was responsible for their pulsation.\r\nThe word arteria, which had already been applied to the trachea, as an\r\nair-containing tube, was then attached to the arteries; on account of\r\nthe rough and uneven character of its walls the trachea was then called\r\nthe arteria tracheia, or the rough air-tube.(31a) We call it simply the\r\ntrachea, but in French the word trachee-artere is still used.\r\n\r\n     (31a) Galen:  De usu partium, VII, Chaps. 8-9.\r\n\r\nPraxagoras was one of the first to make an exhaustive study of the\r\npulse, and he must have been a man of considerable clinical acumen, as\r\nwell as boldness, to recommend in obstruction of the bowels the opening\r\nof the abdomen, removal of the obstructed portion and uniting the ends\r\nof the intestine by sutures.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Alexander, Egypt fell into the hands of his famous\r\ngeneral, Ptolemy, under whose care the city became one of the most\r\nimportant on the Mediterranean. He founded and maintained a museum, an\r\nestablishment that corresponded very much to a modern university, for\r\nthe study of literature, science and the arts. Under his successors,\r\nparticularly the third Ptolemy, the museum developed, more especially\r\nthe library, which contained more than half a million volumes. The\r\nteachers were drawn from all centres, and the names of the great\r\nAlexandrians are among the most famous in the history of human\r\nknowledge, including such men as Archimedes, Euclid, Strabo and Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nIn mechanics and physics, astronomy, mathematics and optics, the work\r\nof the Alexandrians constitutes the basis of a large part of our modern\r\nknowledge. The school-boy of today--or at any rate of my day--studies\r\nthe identical problems that were set by Euclid 300 B.C., and the student\r\nof physics still turns to Archimedes and Heron, and the astronomer to\r\nEratosthenes and Hipparchus. To those of you who wish to get a brief\r\nreview of the state of science in the Alexandrian School I would\r\nrecommend the chapter in Vol. I of Dannemann's history.(31)\r\n\r\n     (31) Friedrich Dannemann: Grundriss einer Geschichte der\r\n     Naturwissenschaften, Vol. I, 3d ed., Leipzig, 1908.\r\n\r\nOf special interest to us in Alexandria is the growth of the first great\r\nmedical school of antiquity. Could we have visited the famous museum\r\nabout 300 B.C., we should have found a medical school in full operation,\r\nwith extensive laboratories, libraries and clinics. Here for the first\r\ntime the study of the structure of the human body reached its full\r\ndevelopment, till then barred everywhere by religious prejudice; but\r\nfull permission was given by the Ptolemies to perform human dissection\r\nand, if we may credit some authors, even vivisection. The original\r\nwritings of the chief men of this school have not been preserved, but\r\nthere is a possibility that any day a papyrus maybe found which will\r\nsupplement the scrappy and imperfect knowledge afforded us by Pliny,\r\nCelsus and Galen. The two most distinguished names are Herophilus--who,\r\nPliny says, has the honor of being the first physician \"who searched\r\ninto the causes of disease\"--and Erasistratus.\r\n\r\nHerophilus, ille anatomicorum coryphaeus, as Vesalius calls him, was a\r\npupil of Praxagoras, and his name is still in everyday use by medical\r\nstudents, attached to the torcular Herophili. Anatomy practically dates\r\nfrom these Alexandrines, who described the valves of the heart, the\r\nduodenum, and many of the important parts of the brain; they recognized\r\nthe true significance of the nerves (which before their day had been\r\nconfounded with the tendons), distinguished between motor and sensory\r\nnerves, and regarded the brain as the seat of the perceptive faculties\r\nand voluntary action. Herophilus counted the pulse, using the\r\nwater-clock for the purpose, and made many subtle analyses of its rate\r\nand rhythm; and, influenced by the musical theories of the period,\r\nhe built up a rhythmical pulse lore which continued in medicine until\r\nrecent times. He was a skilful practitioner and to him is ascribed the\r\nstatement that drugs are the hands of the gods. There is a very modern\r\nflavor to his oft-quoted expression that the best physician was the man\r\nwho was able to distinguish between the possible and the impossible.\r\n\r\nErasistratus elaborated the view of the pneuma, one form of which he\r\nbelieved came from the inspired air, and passed to the left side of\r\nthe heart and to the arteries of the body. It was the cause of the\r\nheart-beat and the source of the innate heat of the body, and it\r\nmaintained the processes of digestion and nutrition. This was the vital\r\nspirit; the animal spirit was elaborated in the brain, chiefly in the\r\nventricles, and sent by the nerves to all parts of the body, endowing\r\nthe individual with life and perception and motion. In this way a great\r\ndivision was made between the two functions of the body, and two sets\r\nof organs: in the vascular system, the heart and arteries and abdominal\r\norgans, life was controlled by the vital spirits; on the other hand,\r\nin the nervous system were elaborated the animal spirits, controlling\r\nmotion, sensation and the various special senses. These views on the\r\nvital and animal spirits held unquestioned sway until well into the\r\neighteenth century, and we still, in a measure, express the views of the\r\ngreat Alexandrian when we speak of \"high\" or \"low\" spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGALEN\r\n\r\nPERGAMON has become little more than a name associated in our memory\r\nwith the fulminations of St. John against the seven churches of Asia;\r\nand on hearing the chapter read, we wondered what was \"Satan's seat\" and\r\nwho were the \"Nicolaitanes\" whose doctrine he so hated. Renewed interest\r\nhas been aroused in the story of its growth and of its intellectual\r\nrivalry with Alexandria since the wonderful discoveries by German\r\narchaeologists which have enabled us actually to see this great Ionian\r\ncapital, and even the \"seat of Satan.\" The illustration here shown is of\r\nthe famous city, in which you can see the Temple of Athena Polis on the\r\nrock, and the amphitheatre. Its interest for us is connected with the\r\ngreatest name, after Hippocrates, in Greek medicine, that of Galen, born\r\nat Pergamon A. D. 130, in whom was united as never before--and\r\nindeed one may say, never since--the treble combination of observer,\r\nexperimenter and philosopher. His father, Nikon, a prosperous architect,\r\nwas urged in a dream to devote his son to the profession of medicine,\r\nupon which study the lad entered in his seventeenth year under Satyrus.\r\nIn his writings, Galen gives many details of his life, mentioning the\r\nnames of his teachers, and many incidents in his Wanderjahre, during\r\nwhich he studied at the best medical schools, including Alexandria.\r\nReturning to his native city he was put in charge of the gladiators,\r\nwhose wounds he said he treated with wine. In the year 162, he paid\r\nhis first visit to Rome, the scene of his greatest labors. Here he gave\r\npublic lectures on anatomy, and became \"the fashion.\" He mentions\r\nmany of his successes; one of them is the well-worn story told also of\r\nErasistratus and Stratonice, but Galen's story is worth telling, and it\r\nis figured as a miniature in the manuscripts of his works. Called to see\r\na lady he found her suffering from general malaise without any fever\r\nor increased action of the pulse. He saw at once that her trouble was\r\nmental and, like a wise physician, engaged her in general conversation.\r\nQuite possibly he knew her story, for the name of a certain actor,\r\nPylades, was mentioned, and he noticed that her pulse at once increased\r\nin rapidity and became irregular. On the next day he arranged that the\r\nname of another actor, Morphus, should be mentioned, and on the third\r\nday the experiment was repeated but without effect. Then on the fourth\r\nevening it was again mentioned that Pylades was dancing, and the pulse\r\nquickened and became irregular, so he concluded that she was in love\r\nwith Pylades. He tells how he was first called to treat the Emperor\r\nMarcus Aurelius, who had a stomach-ache after eating too much cheese. He\r\ntreated the case so successfully that the Emperor remarked, \"I have but\r\none physician, and he is a gentleman.\" He seems to have had good fees,\r\nas he received 400 aurei (about 2000) for a fortnight's attendance upon\r\nthe wife of Boethus.\r\n\r\nHe left Rome for a time in 168 A. D. and returned to Pergamon, but was\r\nrecalled to Rome by the Emperor, whom he accompanied on an expedition\r\nto Germany. There are records in his writings of many journeys, and busy\r\nwith his practice in dissections and experiments he passed a long and\r\nenergetic life, dying, according to most authorities, in the year 200\r\nA.D.\r\n\r\nA sketch of the state of medicine in Rome is given by Celsus in the\r\nfirst of his eight books, and he mentions the names of many of the\r\nleading practitioners, particularly Asclepiades, the Bithynian, a man\r\nof great ability, and a follower of the Alexandrians, who regarded all\r\ndisease as due to a disturbed movement of the atoms. Diet, exercise,\r\nmassage and bathing were his great remedies, and his motto--tuto, cito\r\net jucunde--has been the emulation of all physicians. How important\r\na role he and his successors played until the time of Galen may be\r\ngathered from the learned lectures of Sir Clifford Allbutt(32) on \"Greek\r\nMedicine in Rome\" and from Meyer-Steineg's \"Theodorus Priscianus und die\r\nromische Medizin.\"(33) From certain lay writers we learn that it was the\r\ncustom for popular physicians to be followed on their rounds by crowds\r\nof students. Martial's epigram (V, ix) is often referred to:\r\n\r\n     Languebam: sed tu comitatus protinus ad me\r\n     Venisti centum, Symmache, discipulis.\r\n     Centum me tegigere manus Aquilone gelatae\r\n     Non habui febrem, Symmache, nunc habeo.\r\n\r\n     (32) Allbutt:  British Medical Journal, London, 1909, ii, 1449;\r\n     1515; 1598.\r\n\r\n     (33) Fischer, Jena, 1909.\r\n\r\nAnd in the \"Apollonius of Tyana\" by Philostratus, when Apollonius\r\nwishes to prove an alibi, he calls to witness the physicians of his sick\r\nfriend, Seleucus and Straloctes, who were accompanied by their clinical\r\nclass to the number of about thirty students.(34) But for a first-hand\r\nsketch of the condition of the profession we must go to Pliny, whose\r\naccount in the twenty-ninth book of the \"Natural History\" is one of the\r\nmost interesting and amusing chapters in that delightful work. He quotes\r\nCato's tirade against Greek physicians,--corrupters of the race, whom he\r\nwould have banished from the city,--then he sketches the career of some\r\nof the more famous of the physicians under the Empire, some of whom must\r\nhave had incomes never approached at any other period in the history of\r\nmedicine. The chapter gives a good picture of the stage on which Galen\r\n(practically a contemporary of Pliny) was to play so important a role.\r\nPliny seems himself to have been rather disgusted with the devious paths\r\nof the doctors of his day, and there is no one who has touched with\r\nstronger language upon the weak points of the art of physic. In one\r\nplace he says that it alone has this peculiar art and privilege, \"That\r\nwhosoever professeth himself a physician, is straightwaies beleeved, say\r\nwhat he will: and yet to speake a truth, there are no lies dearer sold\r\nor more daungerous than those which proceed out of a Physician's mouth.\r\nHowbeit, we never once regard or look to that, so blind we are in our\r\ndeepe persuasion of them, and feed our selves each one in a sweet hope\r\nand plausible conceit of our health by them. Moreover, this mischief\r\nthere is besides, That there is no law or statute to punish the\r\nignorance of blind Physicians, though a man lost his life by them:\r\nneither was there ever any man knowne, who had revenge of recompence for\r\nthe evill intreating or misusage under their hands. They learne their\r\nskill by endaungering our lives: and to make proofe and experiments of\r\ntheir medicines, they care not to kill us.\"(35) He says it is hard\r\nthat, while the judges are carefully chosen and selected, physicians\r\nare practically their own judges, and that of the men who may give us a\r\nquick despatch and send us to Heaven or Hell, no enquiry or examination\r\nis made of their quality and worthiness. It is interesting to read so\r\nearly a bitter criticism of the famous \"Theriaca,\" a great compound\r\nmedicine invented by Antiochus III, which had a vogue for fifteen\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\n     (34) Bk. VIII, Chap. VII.\r\n\r\n     (35) Pliny:  Natural History (XXIX, 1), Philemon Holland's\r\n     version, London, 1601, II, 347.\r\n\r\nBut we must return to Galen and his works, which comprise the most\r\nvoluminous body of writings left by any of the ancients. The great\r\nedition is that in twenty-two volumes by Kuhn (1821-1833). The most\r\nuseful editions are the \"Juntines\" of Venice, which were issued in\r\nthirteen editions. In the fourth and subsequent editions a very useful\r\nindex by Brassavola is included. A critical study of the writings is at\r\npresent being made by German scholars for the Prussian Academy, which\r\nwill issue a definitive edition of his works.\r\n\r\nGalen had an eclectic mind and could not identify himself with any\r\nof the prevailing schools, but regarded himself as a disciple of\r\nHippocrates. For our purpose, both his philosophy and his practice are\r\nof minor interest in comparison with his great labors in anatomy and\r\nphysiology.\r\n\r\nIn anatomy, he was a pupil of the Alexandrians to whom he constantly\r\nrefers. Times must have changed since the days of Herophilus, as Galen\r\ndoes not seem ever to have had an opportunity of dissecting the human\r\nbody, and he laments the prejudice which prevents it. In the study of\r\nosteology, he urges the student to be on the lookout for an occasional\r\nhuman bone exposed in a graveyard, and on one occasion he tells of\r\nfinding the carcass of a robber with the bones picked bare by birds and\r\nbeasts. Failing this source, he advises the student to go to Alexandria,\r\nwhere there were still two skeletons. He himself dissected chiefly\r\napes and pigs. His osteology was admirable, and his little tractate \"De\r\nOssibus\" could, with very few changes, be used today by a hygiene class\r\nas a manual. His description of the muscles and of the organs is very\r\nfull, covering, of course, many sins of omission and of commission, but\r\nit was the culmination of the study of the subject by Greek physicians.\r\n\r\nHis work as a physiologist was even more important, for, so far as we\r\nknow, he was the first to carry out experiments on a large scale. In the\r\nfirst place, he was within an ace of discovering the circulation of\r\nthe blood. You may remember that through the errors of Praxagoras and\r\nErasistratus, the arteries were believed to contain air and got their\r\nname on that account: Galen showed by experiment that the arteries\r\ncontain blood and not air. He studied particularly the movements of\r\nthe heart, the action of the valves, and the pulsatile forces in the\r\narteries. Of the two kinds of blood, the one, contained in the venous\r\nsystem, was dark and thick and rich in grosser elements, and served for\r\nthe general nutrition of the body. This system took its origin, as\r\nis clearly shown in the figure, in the liver, the central organ of\r\nnutrition and of sanguification. From the portal system were absorbed,\r\nthrough the stomach and intestines, the products of digestion. From the\r\nliver extend the venae cavae, one to supply the head and arms, the other\r\nthe lower extremities: extending from the right heart was a branch,\r\ncorresponding to the pulmonary artery, the arterial vein which\r\ndistributed blood to the lungs. This was the closed venous system. The\r\narterial system, shown, as you see, quite separate in Figure 31, was\r\nfull of a thinner, brighter, warmer blood, characterized by the presence\r\nof an abundance of the vital spirits. Warmed in the ventricle, it\r\ndistributed vital heat to all parts of the body. The two systems were\r\nclosed and communicated with each other only through certain pores or\r\nperforations in the septum separating the ventricles. At the periphery,\r\nhowever, Galen recognized (as had been done already by the Alexandrians)\r\nthat the arteries anastomose with the veins, \". . . and they mutually\r\nreceive from each other blood and spirits through certain invisible and\r\nextremely small vessels.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how Galen missed the circulation of the\r\nblood. He knew that the valves of the heart determined the direction\r\nof the blood that entered and left the organ, but he did not appreciate\r\nthat it was a pump for distributing the blood, regarding it rather as\r\na fireplace from which the innate heat of the body was derived. He knew\r\nthat the pulsatile force was resident in the walls of the heart and in\r\nthe arteries, and he knew that the expansion, or diastole, drew blood\r\ninto its cavities, and that the systole forced blood out. Apparently his\r\nview was that there was a sort of ebb and flow in both systems--and yet,\r\nhe uses language just such as we would, speaking of the venous system\r\nas \". . . a conduit full of blood with a multitude of canals large and\r\nsmall running out from it and distributing blood to all parts of the\r\nbody.\" He compares the mode of nutrition to irrigating canals and\r\ngardens, with a wonderful dispensation by nature that they should\r\n\"neither lack a sufficient quantity of blood for absorption nor\r\nbe overloaded at any time with excessive supply.\" The function of\r\nrespiration was the introduction of the pneuma, the spirits which passed\r\nfrom the lungs to the heart through the pulmonary vessels. Galen went a\r\ngood deal beyond the idea of Aristotle, reaching our modern conception\r\nthat the function is to maintain the animal heat, and that the\r\nsmoky matters derived from combustion of the blood are discharged by\r\nexpiration.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt on these points in Galen's physiology, as they are\r\nfundamental in the history of the circulation; and they are sufficient\r\nto illustrate his position. Among his other brilliant experiments were\r\nthe demonstration of the function of the laryngeal nerves, of the\r\nmotor and sensory functions of the spinal nerve roots, of the effect\r\nof transverse incision of the spinal cord, and of the effect of\r\nhemisection. Altogether there is no ancient physician in whose writings\r\nare contained so many indications of modern methods of research.\r\n\r\nGalen's views of disease in general are those of Hippocrates, but\r\nhe introduces many refinements and subdivisions according to the\r\npredominance of the four humors, the harmonious combination of\r\nwhich means health, or eucrasia, while their perversion or improper\r\ncombination leads to dyscrasia, or ill health. In treatment he had not\r\nthe simplicity of Hippocrates: he had great faith in drugs and collected\r\nplants from all parts of the known world, for the sale of which he\r\nis said to have had a shop in the neighborhood of the Forum. As I\r\nmentioned, he was an eclectic, held himself aloof from the various\r\nschools of the day, calling no man master save Hippocrates. He might\r\nbe called a rational empiricist. He made war on the theoretical\r\npractitioners of the day, particularly the Methodists, who, like some\r\nof their modern followers, held that their business was with the disease\r\nand not with the conditions out of which it arose.\r\n\r\nNo other physician has ever occupied the commanding position of\r\n\"Clarissimus\" Galenus. For fifteen centuries he dominated medical\r\nthought as powerfully as did Aristotle in the schools. Not until the\r\nRenaissance did daring spirits begin to question the infallibility of\r\nthis medical pope. But here we must part with the last and, in many\r\nways, the greatest of the Greeks--a man very much of our own type, who,\r\ncould he visit this country today, might teach us many lessons. He would\r\nsmile in scorn at the water supply of many of our cities, thinking\r\nof the magnificent aqueducts of Rome and of many of the colonial\r\ntowns--some still in use--which in lightness of structure and in\r\ndurability testify to the astonishing skill of their engineers. There\r\nare country districts in which he would find imperfect drainage and\r\ncould tell of the wonderful system by which Rome was kept sweet and\r\nclean. Nothing would delight him more than a visit to Panama to see what\r\nthe organization of knowledge has been able to accomplish. Everywhere\r\nhe could tour the country as a sanitary expert, preaching the gospel\r\nof good water supply and good drainage, two of the great elements in\r\ncivilization, in which in many places we have not yet reached the Roman\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III -- MEDIAEVAL MEDICINE\r\n\r\nTHERE are waste places of the earth which fill one with terror--not\r\nsimply because they are waste; one has not such feelings in the desert\r\nnor in the vast solitude of the ocean. Very different is it where the\r\ndesolation has overtaken a brilliant and flourishing product of man's\r\nhead and hand. To know that\r\n\r\n     . . . the Lion and the Lizard keep\r\n     The Courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep\r\n\r\nsends a chill to the heart, and one trembles with a sense of human\r\ninstability. With this feeling we enter the Middle Ages. Following the\r\nglory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome, a desolation came\r\nupon the civilized world, in which the light of learning burned low,\r\nflickering almost to extinction. How came it possible that the gifts\r\nof Athens and of Alexandria were deliberately thrown away? For three\r\ncauses. The barbarians shattered the Roman Empire to its foundations.\r\nWhen Alaric entered Rome in 410 A. D., ghastly was the impression made\r\non the contemporaries; the Roman world shuddered in a titanic spasm\r\n(Lindner). The land was a garden of Eden before them, behind a howling\r\nwilderness, as is so graphically told in Gibbon's great history. Many of\r\nthe most important centres of learning were destroyed, and for centuries\r\nMinerva and Apollo forsook the haunts of men. The other equally\r\nimportant cause was the change wrought by Christianity. The brotherhood\r\nof man, the care of the body, the gospel of practical virtues formed the\r\nessence of the teaching of the Founder--in these the Kingdom of Heaven\r\nwas to be sought; in these lay salvation. But the world was very evil,\r\nall thought that the times were waxing late, and into men's minds\r\nentered as never before a conviction of the importance of the four\r\nlast things--death, judgment, heaven and hell. One obstacle alone stood\r\nbetween man and his redemption, the vile body, \"this muddy vesture of\r\ndecay,\" that so grossly wrapped his soul. To find methods of bringing it\r\ninto subjection was the task of the Christian Church for centuries. In\r\nthe Vatican Gallery of Inscriptions is a stone slab with the single word\r\n\"Stercoriae,\" and below, the Christian symbol. It might serve as a motto\r\nfor the Middle Ages, during which, to quote St. Paul, all things were\r\n\"counted dung but to win Christ.\" In this attitude of mind the wisdom\r\nof the Greeks was not simply foolishness, but a stumbling-block in the\r\npath. Knowledge other than that which made a man \"wise unto salvation\"\r\nwas useless. All that was necessary was contained in the Bible or taught\r\nby the Church. This simple creed brought consolation to thousands and\r\nillumined the lives of some of the noblest of men. But, \"in seeking a\r\nheavenly home man lost his bearings upon earth.\" Let me commend for your\r\nreading Taylor's \"Mediaeval Mind.\"(1) I cannot judge of its scholarship,\r\nwhich I am told by scholars is ripe and good, but I can judge of its\r\nusefulness for anyone who wishes to know the story of the mind of man\r\nin Europe at this period. Into the content of mediaeval thought only\r\na mystic can enter with full sympathy. It was a needful change in the\r\nevolution of the race. Christianity brought new ideals and new motives\r\ninto the lives of men. The world's desire was changed, a desire for the\r\nKingdom of Heaven, in the search for which the lust of the flesh, the\r\nlust of the eye and the pride of life were as dross. A master-motive\r\nswayed the minds of sinful men and a zeal to save other souls occupied\r\nthe moments not devoted to the perfection of their own. The new\r\ndispensation made any other superfluous. As Tertullian said:\r\nInvestigation since the Gospel is no longer necessary. (Dannemann, Die\r\nNaturw., I, p. 214.) The attitude of the early Fathers toward the body\r\nis well expressed by Jerome. \"Does your skin roughen without baths? Who\r\nis once washed in the blood of Christ needs not wash again.\" In this\r\nunfavorable medium for its growth, science was simply disregarded, not\r\nin any hostile spirit, but as unnecessary.(2) And a third contributing\r\nfactor was the plague of the sixth century, which desolated the whole\r\nRoman world. On the top of the grand mausoleum of Hadrian, visitors at\r\nRome see the figure of a gilded angel with a drawn sword, from which\r\nthe present name of the Castle of St. Angelo takes its origin. On the\r\ntwenty-fifth of April, 590, there set out from the Church of SS.\r\nCosmas and Damian, already the Roman patron saints of medicine, a vast\r\nprocession, led by St. Gregory the Great, chanting a seven-fold litany\r\nof intercession against the plague. The legend relates that Gregory\r\nsaw on the top of Hadrian's tomb an angel with a drawn sword, which he\r\nsheathed as the plague abated.\r\n\r\n     (1) H. O.

(New edition, 1920.)\r\n\r\n     (2) Ibid., Vol. 1, p. 13: \"Under their action (the Christian\r\n     Fathers) the peoples of Western Europe, from the eighth to the\r\n     thirteenth century, passed through a homogeneous growth, and\r\n     evolved a spirit different from that of any other period of\r\n     history--a spirit which stood in awe before its monitors divine\r\n     and human, and deemed that knowledge was to be drawn from the\r\n     storehouse of the past; which seemed to rely on everything except\r\n     its sin-crushed self, and trusted everything except its senses;\r\n     which in the actual looked for the ideal, in the concrete saw the\r\n     symbol, in the earthly Church beheld the heavenly, and in fleshly\r\n     joys discerned the devil's lures; which lived in the unreconciled\r\n     opposition between the lust and vain-glory of earth and the\r\n     attainment of salvation; which felt life's terror and its\r\n     pitifulness, and its eternal hope; around which waved concrete\r\n     infinitudes, and over which flamed the terror of darkness and the\r\n     Judgment Day.\"\r\n\r\nGalen died about 200 A.D.; the high-water mark of the Renaissance, so\r\nfar as medicine is concerned, was reached in the year 1542. In order to\r\ntraverse this long interval intelligently, I will sketch certain great\r\nmovements, tracing the currents of Greek thought, setting forth in their\r\nworks the lives of certain great leaders, until we greet the dawn of our\r\nown day.\r\n\r\nAfter flowing for more than a thousand years through the broad plain of\r\nGreek civilization, the stream of scientific medicine which we have\r\nbeen following is apparently lost in the morass of the Middle Ages; but,\r\nchecked and blocked like the White Nile in the Soudan, three channels\r\nmay be followed through the weeds of theological and philosophical\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH ITALIAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\nA WIDE stream is in Italy, where the \"antique education never stopped,\r\nantique reminiscence and tradition never passed away, and the literary\r\nmatter of the pagan past never faded from the consciousness of the more\r\neducated among the laity and clergy.\"(3) Greek was the language of South\r\nItaly and was spoken in some of its eastern towns until the thirteenth\r\ncentury. The cathedral and monastic schools served to keep alive the\r\nancient learning. Monte Casino stands pre-eminent as a great hive of\r\nstudents, and to the famous Regula of St. Benedict(4) we are indebted\r\nfor the preservation of many precious manuscripts.\r\n\r\n     (3) H. O. Taylor:  The Mediaeval Mind, Vol. I, p. 251.\r\n\r\n     (4) De Renzi:  Storia Documentata della Scuola Medica di Salerno,\r\n     2d ed., Napoli, 1867, Chap. V.\r\n\r\nThe Norman Kingdom of South Italy and Sicily was a meeting ground of\r\nSaracens, Greeks and Lombards. Greek, Arabic and Latin were in constant\r\nuse among the people of the capital, and Sicilian scholars of the\r\ntwelfth century translated directly from the Greek.\r\n\r\nThe famous \"Almagest\" of Ptolemy, the most important work of ancient\r\nastronomy, was translated from a Greek manuscript, as early as 1160, by\r\na medical student of Salerno.(5)\r\n\r\n     (5) Haskins and Lockwood:  Harvard Studies in Classical\r\n     Philology, 1910, XXI, pp. 75-102.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty miles southeast of Naples lay Salernum, which for centuries\r\nkept alight the lamp of the old learning, and became the centre of\r\nmedical studies in the Middle Ages; well deserving its name of \"Civitas\r\nHippocratica.\" The date of foundation is uncertain, but Salernitan\r\nphysicians are mentioned as early as the middle of the ninth century,\r\nand from this date until the rise of the universities it was not only a\r\ngreat medical school, but a popular resort for the sick and wounded. As\r\nthe scholar says in Longfellow's \"Golden Legend\":\r\n\r\n     Then at every season of the year\r\n     There are crowds of guests and travellers here;\r\n     Pilgrims and mendicant friars and traders\r\n     From the Levant, with figs and wine,\r\n     And bands of wounded and sick Crusaders,\r\n     Coming back from Palestine.\r\n\r\nThere were medical and surgical clinics, foundling hospitals, Sisters\r\nof Charity, men and women professors--among the latter the famous\r\nTrotula--and apothecaries. Dissections were carried out, chiefly upon\r\nanimals, and human subjects were occasionally used. In the eleventh and\r\ntwelfth centuries, the school reached its height, and that remarkable\r\ngenius, Frederick II, laid down regulations for a preliminary study\r\nextending over three years, and a course in medicine for five years,\r\nincluding surgery. Fee tables and strict regulations as to practice were\r\nmade; and it is specifically stated that the masters were to teach\r\nin the schools, theoretically and practically, under the authority of\r\nHippocrates and Galen. The literature from the school had a far-reaching\r\ninfluence. One book on the anatomy of the pig illustrates the popular\r\nsubject for dissection at that time.(6) The writings, which are\r\nnumerous, have been collected by De Renzi.(7)\r\n\r\n     (6) \"And dissections of the bodies of swine\r\n     As likest the human form divine.\"--Golden Legend.\r\n\r\n     (7) S. de Renzi: Collectio Salernitana, 5 vols., Naples,\r\n     1852-1859; P. Giacosa: Magistri Salernitani, Turin, 1901.\r\n\r\nThe \"Antidotarium\" of Nicolaus Salernitanus, about 1100, became the\r\npopular pharmacopoeia of the Middle Ages, and many modern preparations\r\nmay be traced to it.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent man of the school is Constantinus Africanus, a native\r\nof Carthage, who, after numerous journeys, reached Salernum about the\r\nmiddle of the eleventh century. He was familiar with the works both of\r\nthe Greeks and of the Arabs, and it was largely through his translations\r\nthat the works of Rhazes and Avicenna became known in the West.\r\n\r\nOne work above all others spread the fame of the school--the Regimen\r\nSanitatis, or Flos Medicinae as it is sometimes called, a poem on\r\npopular medicine. It is dedicated to Robert of Normandy, who had been\r\ntreated at Salernum, and the lines begin: \"Anglorum regi scripsit schola\r\ntota Salerni . . . \" It is a hand-book of diet and household medicine,\r\nwith many shrewd and taking sayings which have passed into popular use,\r\nsuch as \"Joy, temperance and repose Slam the door on the doctor's nose.\"\r\nA full account of the work and the various editions of it is given\r\nby Sir Alexander Croke,(8) and the Finlayson lecture (Glasgow Medical\r\nJournal, 1908) by Dr. Norman Moore gives an account of its introduction\r\ninto the British Isles.\r\n\r\n     (8) Regimen Sanitutis Salernitanum; a Poem on the Preservation of\r\n     Health in Rhyming Latin Verse, Oxford, D.A. Talboys, 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBYZANTINE MEDICINE\r\n\r\nTHE second great stream which carried Greek medicine to modern days runs\r\nthrough the Eastern Empire. Between the third century and the fall of\r\nConstantinople there was a continuous series of Byzantine physicians\r\nwhose inspiration was largely derived from the old Greek sources. The\r\nmost distinguished of these was Oribasius, a voluminous compiler, a\r\nnative of Pergamon and so close a follower of his great townsman that he\r\nhas been called \"Galen's ape.\" He left many works, an edition of which\r\nwas edited by Bussemaker and Daremberg. Many facts relating to the older\r\nwriters are recorded in his writings. He was a contemporary, friend as\r\nwell as the physician, of the Emperor Julian, for whom he prepared an\r\nencyclopaedia of the medical sciences.\r\n\r\nOther important Byzantine writers were Aetius and Alexander of Tralles,\r\nboth of whom were strongly under the influence of Galen and Hippocrates.\r\nTheir materia medica was based largely upon Dioscorides.\r\n\r\nFrom Byzantium we have the earliest known complete medical manuscript,\r\ndating from the fifth century--a work of Dioscorides--one of the most\r\nbeautiful in existence. It was prepared for Anicia Juliana, daughter of\r\nthe Emperor of the East, and is now one of the great treasures of the\r\nImperial Library at Vienna.(9) From those early centuries till the fall\r\nof Constantinople there is very little of interest medically. A few\r\nnames stand out prominently, but it is mainly a blank period in our\r\nrecords. Perhaps one man may be mentioned, as he had a great influence\r\non later ages--Actuarius, who lived about 1300, and whose book on\r\nthe urine laid the foundation of much of the popular uroscopy and\r\nwater-casting that had such a vogue in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies. His work on the subject passed through a dozen Latin\r\neditions, but is best studied in Ideler's \"Physici et medici Graeci\r\nminores\" (Berlin, 1841).\r\n\r\n     (9) It has been reproduced by Seatone de Vries, Leyden, 1905,\r\n     Codices graeci et latini photographice depicti, Vol. X.\r\n\r\nThe Byzantine stream of Greek medicine had dwindled to a very tiny rill\r\nwhen the fall of Constantinople (1453) dispersed to the West many Greek\r\nscholars and many precious manuscripts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARABIAN MEDICINE\r\n\r\nTHE third and by far the strongest branch of the Greek river reached the\r\nWest after a remarkable and meandering course. The map before you shows\r\nthe distribution of the Graeco-Roman Christian world at the beginning of\r\nthe seventh century. You will notice that Christianity had extended\r\nfar eastwards, almost to China. Most of those eastern Christians were\r\nNestorians and one of their important centres was Edessa, whose school\r\nof learning became so celebrated. Here in the fifth century was built\r\none of the most celebrated hospitals of antiquity.\r\n\r\nNow look at another map showing the same countries about a century\r\nlater. No such phenomenal change ever was made within so short space\r\nof time as that which thus altered the map of Asia and Europe at this\r\nperiod. Within a century, the Crescent had swept from Arabia through the\r\nEastern Empire, over Egypt, North Africa and over Spain in the West, and\r\nthe fate of Western Europe hung in the balance before the gates of Tours\r\nin 732. This time the barbaric horde that laid waste a large part of\r\nChristendom were a people that became deeply appreciative of all that\r\nwas best in Graeco-Roman civilization and of nothing more than of its\r\nsciences. The cultivation of medicine was encouraged by the Arabs in a\r\nvery special way. Anyone wishing to follow the history of the medical\r\nprofession among this remarkable people will find it admirably presented\r\nin Lucien Leclerc's \"Histoire de la medecine arabe\" (Paris, 1876).\r\nAn excellent account is also given in Freind's well-known \"History of\r\nMedicine\" (London, 1725-1726). Here I can only indicate very briefly the\r\ncourse of the stream and its freightage.\r\n\r\nWith the rise of Christianity, Alexandria became a centre of bitter\r\ntheological and political factions, the story of which haunts the\r\nmemory of anyone who was so fortunate as to read in his youth Kingsley's\r\n\"Hypatia.\" These centuries, with their potent influence of neoplatonism\r\non Christianity, appear to have been sterile enough in medicine. I have\r\nalready referred to the late Greeks, Aetius and Alexander of Tralles.\r\nThe last of the Alexandrians was a remarkable man, Paul of AEgina, a\r\ngreat name in medicine and in surgery, who lived in the early part of\r\nthe seventh century. He also, like Oribasius, was a great compiler. In\r\nthe year 640, the Arabs took Alexandria, and for the third time a great\r\nlibrary was destroyed in the \"first city of the West.\" Shortly after\r\nthe conquest of Egypt, Greek works were translated into Arabic, often\r\nthrough the medium of Syriac, particularly certain of Galen's books\r\non medicine, and chemical writings, which appear to have laid the\r\nfoundation of Arabian knowledge on this subject.\r\n\r\nThrough Alexandria then was one source: but the special development of\r\nthe Greek science and of medicine took place in the ninth century under\r\nthe Eastern Caliphates. Let me quote here a couple of sentences from\r\nLeclerc (Tome I, pp. 91-92):\r\n\r\n\"The world has but once witnessed so marvellous a spectacle as that\r\npresented by the Arabs in the ninth century. This pastoral people, whose\r\nfanaticism had suddenly made them masters of half of the world, having\r\nonce founded their empire, immediately set themselves to acquire that\r\nknowledge of the sciences which alone was lacking to their greatness. Of\r\nall the invaders who competed for the last remains of the Roman Empire\r\nthey alone pursued such studies; while the Germanic hordes, glorying\r\nin their brutality and ignorance, took a thousand years to re-unite the\r\nbroken chain of tradition, the Arabs accomplished this in less than a\r\ncentury. They provoked the competition of the conquered Christians--a\r\nhealthy competition which secured the harmony of the races.\r\n\r\n\"At the end of the eighth century, their whole scientific possessions\r\nconsisted of a translation of one medical treatise and some books on\r\nalchemy. Before the ninth century had run to its close, the Arabs were\r\nin possession of all the science of the Greeks; they had produced from\r\ntheir own ranks students of the first order, and had raised among their\r\ninitiators men who, without them, would have been groping in the dark;\r\nand they showed from this time an aptitude for the exact sciences, which\r\nwas lacking in their instructors, whom they henceforward surpassed.\"\r\n\r\nIt was chiefly through the Nestorians that the Arabs became acquainted\r\nwith Greek medicine, and there were two famous families of translators,\r\nthe Bakhtishuas and the Mesues, both Syrians, and probably not\r\nvery thoroughly versed in either Greek or Arabic. But the prince of\r\ntranslators, one of the finest figures of the century, was Honein, a\r\nChristian Arab, born in 809, whose name was Latinized as Joannitius.\r\n\"The marvellous extent of his works, their excellence, their importance,\r\nthe trials he bore nobly at the beginning of his career, everything\r\nabout him arouses our interest and sympathy. If he did not actually\r\ncreate the Oriental renaissance movement, certainly no one played in\r\nit a more active, decided and fruitful part.\"(10) His industry was\r\ncolossal. He translated most of the works of Hippocrates and Galen,\r\nAristotle and many others. His famous \"Introduction\" or \"Isagoge,\"\r\na very popular book in the Middle Ages, is a translation of the\r\n\"Microtegni\" of Galen, a small hand-book, of which a translation is\r\nappended to Cholmeley's \"John of Gaddesden.\"(11) The first printed\r\nedition of it appeared in 1475 (see Chapter IV) at Padua.\r\n\r\n     (10) Leclerc:  Histoire de la medecine arabe, Tome I, p. 139.\r\n\r\n     (11) Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1912, pp. 136-166. The Mesues also\r\n     did great work, and translations of their compilations,\r\n     particularly those of the younger Mesue, were widely distributed\r\n     in manuscript and were early printed (Venice, 1471) and\r\n     frequently reprinted, even as late as the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nLeclerc gives the names of more than one hundred known translators who\r\nnot only dealt with the physicians but with the Greek philosophers,\r\nmathematicians and astronomers. The writings of the physicians of India\r\nand of Persia were also translated into Arabic.\r\n\r\nBut close upon the crowd of translators who introduced the learning of\r\nGreece to the Arabians came original observers of the first rank, to a\r\nfew only of whom time will allow me to refer. Rhazes, so called from the\r\nname of the town (Rai) in which he was born, was educated at the great\r\nhospital at Bagdad in the second half of the ninth century. With a true\r\nHippocratic spirit he made many careful observations on disease, and\r\nto him we owe the first accurate account of smallpox, which he\r\ndifferentiated from measles. This work was translated for the old\r\nSydenham Society by W.A. Greenhill (1848), and the description given\r\nof the disease is well worth reading. He was a man of strong powers\r\nof observation, good sense and excellent judgment. His works were very\r\npopular, particularly the gigantic \"Continens,\" one of the bulkiest of\r\nincunabula. The Brescia edition, 1486, a magnificent volume, extends\r\nover 588 pages and it must weigh more than seventeen pounds. It is an\r\nencyclopaedia filled with extracts from the Greek and other writers,\r\ninterspersed with memoranda of his own experiences. His \"Almansor\" was\r\na very popular text-book, and one of the first to be printed. Book IX\r\nof \"Almansor\" (the name of the prince to whom it was addressed) with the\r\ntitle \"De aegritudinibus a capite usque ad pedes,\" was a very favorite\r\nmediaeval text-book. On account of his zeal for study Rhazes was known\r\nas the \"Experimentator.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of the Arabians, known throughout the Middle Ages as the\r\nPrince, the rival, indeed, of Galen, was the Persian Ibn Sina, better\r\nknown as Avicenna, one of the greatest names in the history of medicine.\r\nBorn about 980 A. D. in the province of Khorasan, near Bokhara, he has\r\nleft a brief autobiography from which we learn something of his early\r\nyears. He could repeat the Koran by heart when ten years old, and at\r\ntwelve he had disputed in law and in logic. So that he found medicine\r\nwas an easy subject, not hard and thorny like mathematics and\r\nmetaphysics! He worked night and day, and could solve problems in his\r\ndreams. \"When I found a difficulty,\" he says, \"I referred to my notes\r\nand prayed to the Creator. At night, when weak or sleepy, I strengthened\r\nmyself with a glass of wine.\"(12) He was a voluminous writer to whom\r\nscores of books are attributed, and he is the author of the most famous\r\nmedical text-book ever written. It is safe to say that the \"Canon\" was\r\na medical bible for a longer period than any other work. It \"stands for\r\nthe epitome of all precedent development, the final codification of all\r\nGraeco-Arabic medicine. It is a hierarchy of laws liberally illustrated\r\nby facts which so ingeniously rule and are subject to one another, stay\r\nand uphold one another, that admiration is compelled for the sagacity\r\nof the great organiser who, with unparalleled power of systematisation,\r\ncollecting his material from all sources, constructed so imposing an\r\nedifice of fallacy. Avicenna, according to his lights, imparted to\r\ncontemporary medical science the appearance of almost mathematical\r\naccuracy, whilst the art of therapeutics, although empiricism did\r\nnot wholly lack recognition, was deduced as a logical sequence from\r\ntheoretical (Galenic and Aristotelian) premises. Is it, therefore,\r\nmatter for surprise that the majority of investigators and practitioners\r\nshould have fallen under the spell of this consummation of formalism and\r\nshould have regarded the 'Canon' as an infallible oracle, the more so\r\nin that the logical construction was impeccable and the premises, in\r\nthe light of contemporary conceptions, passed for incontrovertible\r\naxioms?\"(13)\r\n\r\n     (12) Withington:  Medical History, London, 1894, pp. 151-152.\r\n\r\n     (13) Neuburger:  History of Medicine, Vol. I, pp. 368-369.\r\n\r\nInnumerable manuscripts of it exist: of one of the most beautiful,\r\na Hebrew version (Bologna Library), I give an illustration. A Latin\r\nversion was printed in 1472 and there are many later editions, the last\r\nin 1663. Avicenna was not only a successful writer, but the prototype\r\nof the successful physician who was at the same time statesman, teacher,\r\nphilosopher and literary man. Rumor has it that he became dissipated,\r\nand a contemporary saying was that all his philosophy could not make him\r\nmoral, nor all his physic teach him to preserve his health. He enjoyed a\r\ngreat reputation as a poet. I reproduce a page of a manuscript of one of\r\nhis poems, which we have in the Bodleian Library. Prof. A.V.W. Jackson\r\nsays that some of his verse is peculiarly Khayyamesque, though he\r\nantedated Omar by a century. That \"large Infidel\" might well have\r\nwritten such a stanza as\r\n\r\n     From Earth's dark centre unto Saturn's Gate\r\n     I've solved all problems of this world's Estate,\r\n     From every snare of Plot and Guile set free,\r\n     Each bond resolved, saving alone Death's Fate.\r\n\r\nHis hymn to the Deity might have been written by Plato and rivals the\r\nfamous one of Cleanthes.(14) A casual reader gets a very favorable\r\nimpression of Avicenna. The story of his dominion over the schools in\r\nthe Middle Ages is one of the most striking in our history. Perhaps we\r\nfeel that Leclerc exaggerates when he says: \"Avicenna is an intellectual\r\nphenomenon. Never perhaps has an example been seen of so precocious,\r\nquick and wide an intellect extending and asserting itself with so\r\nstrange and indefatigable an activity.\" The touch of the man never\r\nreached me until I read some of his mystical and philosophical writings\r\ntranslated by Mehren.(15) It is Plato over again. The beautiful allegory\r\nin which men are likened to birds snared and caged until set free by the\r\nAngel of Death might be met with anywhere in the immortal Dialogues.\r\nThe tractate on Love is a commentary on the Symposium; and the essay on\r\nDestiny is Greek in spirit without a trace of Oriental fatalism, as you\r\nmay judge from the concluding sentence, which I leave you as his special\r\nmessage: \"Take heed to the limits of your capacity and you will arrive\r\nat a knowledge of the truth! How true is the saying:--Work ever and to\r\neach will come that measure of success for which Nature has designed\r\nhim.\" Avicenna died in his fifty-eighth year. When he saw that physic\r\nwas of no avail, resigning himself to the inevitable, he sold his goods,\r\ndistributed the money to the poor, read the Koran through once every\r\nthree days, and died in the holy month of Ramadan. His tomb at Hamadan,\r\nthe ancient Ecbatana, still exists, a simple brickwork building,\r\nrectangular in shape, and surrounded by an unpretentious court. It was\r\nrestored in 1877, but is again in need of repair. The illustration here\r\nshown is from a photograph sent by Dr. Neligan of Teheran. Though\r\ndead, the great Persian has still a large practice, as his tomb is much\r\nvisited by pilgrims, among whom cures are said to be not uncommon.\r\n\r\n     (14) \"L'hymne d'Avicenne\" in:  L'Elegie du Tograi, etc., par P.\r\n     Vattier, Paris, 1660.\r\n\r\n     (15) Traites mystiques d'Abou Ali al-Hosain b.  Abdallah b.  Sina\r\n     ou d'Avicenne par M. A. F. Mehren, Leyden, E. J. Brill, Fasc.\r\n     I-IV, 1889-1899.\r\n\r\nThe Western Caliphate produced physicians and philosophers almost as\r\nbrilliant as those of the East. Remarkable schools of medicine\r\nwere founded at Seville, Toledo and Cordova. The most famous of the\r\nprofessors were Averroes, Albucasis and Avenzoar. Albucasis was \"the\r\nArabian restorer of surgery.\" Averroes, called in the Middle Ages \"the\r\nSoul of Aristotle\" or \"the Commentator,\" is better known today among\r\nphilosophers than physicians. On the revival of Moslem orthodoxy he\r\nfell upon evil days, was persecuted as a free-thinker, and the saying is\r\nattributed to him--\"Sit anima mea cum philosophic.\"\r\n\r\nArabian medicine had certain very definite characteristics: the basis\r\nwas Greek, derived from translations of the works of Hippocrates and\r\nGalen. No contributions were made to anatomy, as dissections were\r\nprohibited, nor to physiology, and the pathology was practically that\r\nof Galen. Certain new and important diseases were described; a number\r\nof new and active remedies were introduced, chiefly from the vegetable\r\nkingdom. The Arabian hospitals were well organized and were deservedly\r\nfamous. No such hospital exists today in Cairo as that which was built\r\nby al-Mansur Gilafun in 1283. The description of it by Makrizi, quoted\r\nby Neuburger,(16) reads like that of a twentieth century institution\r\nwith hospital units.\r\n\r\n(16) \"I have founded this institution for my equals and for those\r\nbeneath me, it is intended for rulers and subjects, for soldiers and for\r\nthe emir, for great and small, freemen and slaves, men and women.\"\r\n\"He ordered medicaments, physicians and everything else that could\r\nbe required by anyone in any form of sickness; placed male and female\r\nattendants at the disposal of the patients, determined their pay,\r\nprovided beds for patients and supplied them with every kind of covering\r\nthat could be required in any complaint. Every class of patient was\r\naccorded separate accommodation: the four halls of the hospital were\r\nset apart for those with fever and similar complaints; one part of the\r\nbuilding was reserved for eye-patients, one for the wounded, one for\r\nthose suffering from diarrhoea, one for women; a room for convalescents\r\nwas divided into two parts, one for men and one for women. Water was\r\nlaid on to all these departments. One room was set apart for cooking\r\nfood, preparing medicine and cooking syrups, another for the compounding\r\nof confections, balsams, eye-salves, etc. The head-physician had an\r\napartment to himself wherein he delivered medical lectures. The number\r\nof patients was unlimited, every sick or poor person who came found\r\nadmittance, nor was the duration of his stay restricted, and even those\r\nwho were sick at home were supplied with every necessity.\"--Makrizi.\r\n\r\n\"In later times this hospital was much extended and improved. The\r\nnursing was admirable and no stint was made of drugs and appliances;\r\neach patient was provided with means upon leaving so that he should\r\nnot require immediately to undertake heavy work.\" Neuburger: History of\r\nMedicine, Vol. 1, p. 378.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the domain of chemistry that the Arabs made the greatest\r\nadvances. You may remember that, in Egypt, chemistry had already made\r\nconsiderable strides, and I alluded to Prof. Elliot Smith's view that\r\none of the great leaps in civilization was the discovery in the Nile\r\nValley of the metallurgy of copper. In the brilliant period of the\r\nPtolemies, both chemistry and pharmacology were studied, and it seems\r\nnot improbable that, when the Arabs took Alexandria in the year 640,\r\nthere were still many workers in these subjects.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of those early Arabic writers is the somewhat mythical\r\nGeber, who lived in the first half of the eighth century, and whose\r\nwritings had an extraordinary influence throughout the Middle Ages.\r\nThe whole story of Geber is discussed by Berthelot in his \"La chimie\r\nau moyen age\" (Paris, 1896). The transmission of Arabian science to\r\nthe Occident began with the Crusades, though earlier a filtering of\r\nimportant knowledge in mathematics and astronomy had reached Southern\r\nand Middle Europe through Spain. Among the translators several names\r\nstand out prominently. Gerbert, who became later Pope Sylvester II, is\r\nsaid to have given us our present Arabic figures. You may read the story\r\nof his remarkable life in Taylor,(17) who says he was \"the first mind\r\nof his time, its greatest teacher, its most eager learner, and most\r\nuniversal scholar.\" But he does not seem to have done much directly for\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n     (17) The Mediaeval Mind, Vol. I, p. 280.\r\n\r\nThe Graeco-Arabic learning passed into Europe through two sources. As\r\nI have already mentioned, Constantinus Africanus, a North African\r\nChristian monk, widely travelled and learned in languages, came to\r\nSalernum and translated many works from Arabic into Latin, particularly\r\nthose of Hippocrates and Galen. The \"Pantegni\" of the latter became one\r\nof the most popular text-books of the Middle Ages. A long list of other\r\nworks which he translated is given by Steinschneider.(17a) It is not\r\nunlikely that Arabic medicine had already found its way to Salernum\r\nbefore the time of Constantine, but the influence of his translations\r\nupon the later Middle Ages was very great.\r\n\r\n     (17a) Steinschneider:  Virchow's Arch., Berl., 1867, xxxvii, 351.\r\n\r\nThe second was a more important source through the Latin translators\r\nin Spain, particularly in Toledo, where, from the middle of the twelfth\r\ntill the middle of the thirteenth century, an extraordinary number of\r\nArabic works in philosophy, mathematics and astronomy were translated.\r\nAmong the translators, Gerard of Cremona is prominent, and has been\r\ncalled the \"Father of Translators.\" He was one of the brightest\r\nintelligences of the Middle Ages, and did a work of the first importance\r\nto science, through the extraordinary variety of material he put in\r\ncirculation. Translations, not only of the medical writers, but of an\r\nindiscriminate crowd of authors in philosophy and general literature,\r\ncame from his pen. He furnished one of the first translations of\r\nthe famous \"Almagest\" of Ptolemy, which opened the eyes of his\r\ncontemporaries to the value of the Alexandrian astronomy.(18) Leclerc\r\ngives a list of seventy-one works from his hand.\r\n\r\n     (18) For an account of that remarkable work see German\r\n     translation by Manitius, Leipzig, 1912.\r\n\r\nMany of the translators of the period were Jews, and many of the works\r\nwere translated from Hebrew into Latin. For years Arabic had been the\r\nlearned language of the Jews, and in a large measure it was through them\r\nthat the Arabic knowledge and the translations passed into South and\r\nCentral Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Arab writer whose influence on mediaeval thought was the most\r\nprofound was Averroes, the great commentator on Aristotle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF THE UNIVERSITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE most striking intellectual phenomenon of the thirteenth century is\r\nthe rise of the universities. The story of their foundation is fully\r\nstated in Rashdall's great work (Universities of Europe in the Middle\r\nAges, Oxford, 1895). Monastic and collegiate schools, seats of learning\r\nlike Salernum, student guilds as at Bologna, had tried to meet the\r\neducational needs of the age. The word \"university\" literally means\r\nan association, and was not at first restricted to learned bodies. The\r\norigin appears to have been in certain guilds of students formed for\r\nmutual protection associated at some place specially favorable for\r\nstudy--the attraction generally being a famous teacher. The University\r\nof Bologna grew up about guilds formed by students of law, and at\r\nParis, early in the twelfth century, there were communities of teachers,\r\nchiefly in philosophy and theology. In this way arose two different\r\ntypes of mediaeval university. The universities of Northern Italy were\r\nlargely controlled by students, who were grouped in different \"nations.\"\r\nThey arranged the lectures and had control of the appointment of\r\nteachers. On the other hand, in the universities founded on the Paris\r\nmodel the masters had control of the studies, though the students, also\r\nin nations, managed their own affairs.\r\n\r\nTwo universities have a special interest at this period in connection\r\nwith the development of medical studies, Bologna and Montpellier. At\r\nthe former the study of anatomy was revived. In the knowledge of the\r\nstructure of the human body no advance had been made for more than a\r\nthousand years--since Galen's day. In the process of translation from\r\nGreek to Syriac, from Syriac to Arabic, from Arabic to Hebrew, and from\r\nHebrew or Arabic to Latin, both the form and thought of the old Greek\r\nwriters were not infrequently confused and often even perverted, and\r\nGalen's anatomy had suffered severely in the transmission. Our earliest\r\nknowledge of the teaching of medicine at Bologna is connected with a\r\ncontemporary of Dante, Taddeo Alderotti, who combined Arabian erudition\r\nwith the Greek spirit. He occupied a position of extraordinary\r\nprominence, was regarded as the first citizen of Bologna and a public\r\nbenefactor exempt from the payment of taxes. That he should have\r\nacquired wealth is not surprising if his usual fees were at the rate\r\nat which he charged Pope Honorius IV, i.e., two hundred florins a day,\r\nbesides a \"gratification\" of six thousand florins.\r\n\r\nThe man who most powerfully influenced the study of medicine in Bologna\r\nwas Mundinus, the first modern student of anatomy. We have seen that\r\nat the school of Salernum it was decreed that the human body should be\r\ndissected at least once every five years, but it was with the greatest\r\ndifficulty that permission was obtained for this purpose. It seems\r\nprobable that under the strong influence of Taddeo there was an\r\noccasional dissection at Bologna, but it was not until Mundinus\r\n(professor from 1306 to 1326) took the chair that the study of anatomy\r\nbecame popular. The bodies were usually those of condemned criminals,\r\nbut in the year 1319 there is a record of a legal procedure against four\r\nmedical students for body-snatching--the first record, as far as I know,\r\nof this gruesome practice. In 1316, Mundinus issued his work on anatomy,\r\nwhich served as a text-book for more than two hundred years. He quotes\r\nfrom Galen the amusing reasons why a man should write a book: \"Firstly,\r\nto satisfy his own friends; secondly, to exercise his best mental\r\npowers; and thirdly, to be saved from the oblivion incident to old age.\"\r\nScores of manuscripts of his work must have existed, but they are now\r\nexcessively rare in Italy. The book was first printed at Pavia in 1478,\r\nin a small folio without figures. It was very often reprinted in the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The quaint illustration shows us the\r\nmediaeval method of teaching anatomy: the lecturer sitting on a chair\r\nreading from Galen, while a barber surgeon, or an \"Ostensor,\" opens the\r\ncavities of the body.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the study of medicine by women at Salernum.\r\nTheir names are also early met with in the school of Bologna. Mundinus\r\nis said to have had a valuable assistant, a young girl, Alessandra\r\nGiliani, an enthusiastic dissector, who was the first to practice the\r\ninjection of the blood vessels with colored liquids. She died, consumed\r\nby her labors, at the early age of nineteen, and her monument is still\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\nBologna honored its distinguished professors with magnificent tombs,\r\nsixteen or seventeen of which, in a wonderful state of preservation,\r\nmay still be seen in the Civic Museum. That of Mundinus also exists--a\r\nsepulchral bas-relief on the wall of the Church of San Vitale at\r\nBologna.(19)\r\n\r\n     (19) For these figures and for points relating to the old school\r\n     at Bologna see F. G. Cavezza:  Le Scuole dell' antico Studio\r\n     Bolognese, Milano, 1896.\r\n\r\nThe other early mediaeval university of special interest in medicine is\r\nthat of Montpellier. With it are connected three teachers who have left\r\ngreat names in our story--Arnold of Villanova, Henri de Mondeville and\r\nGuy de Chauliac. The city was very favorably situated not far from the\r\nSpanish border, and the receding tide of the Arab invasion in the eighth\r\ncentury had left a strong Arabic influence in that province. The date\r\nof the origin of the university is uncertain, but there were teachers of\r\nmedicine there in the twelfth century, though it was not until 1289 that\r\nit was formally founded by a papal bull.\r\n\r\nArnold of Villanova was one of the most prolific writers of the Middle\r\nAges. He had travelled much, was deeply read in Arabic medicine and was\r\nalso a student of law and of philosophy. He was an early editor of the\r\nRegimen Sanitatis, and a strong advocate of diet and hygiene. His views\r\non disease were largely those of the Arabian physicians, and we\r\ncannot see that he himself made any very important contribution to our\r\nknowledge; but he was a man of strong individuality and left an enduring\r\nmark on mediaeval medicine, as one may judge from the fact that among\r\nthe first hundred medical books printed there were many associated\r\nwith his name. He was constantly in trouble with the Church, though\r\nbefriended by the Popes on account of his medical knowledge. There is\r\na Bull of Clement V asking the bishops to search for a medical book by\r\nArnold dedicated to himself, but not many years later his writings were\r\ncondemned as heretical.\r\n\r\nIn Henri de Mondeville we have the typical mediaeval surgeon, and we\r\nknow his work now very thoroughly from the editions of his \"Anatomy\"\r\nand \"Surgery\" edited by Pagel (Berlin, 1889-1892), and the fine French\r\nedition by Nicaise (Paris, 1893). The dominant Arabic influence is seen\r\nin that he quotes so large a proportion of these authors, but he was an\r\nindependent observer and a practical surgeon of the first rank. He had a\r\nsharp wit and employed a bitter tongue against the medical abuses of his\r\nday. How the Hippocratic humors dominated practice at this time you may\r\nsee at a glance from the table prepared by Nicaise from the works of de\r\nMondeville. We have here the whole pathology of the period.\r\n\r\n     ===============================================================\r\n\r\n     TABLEAU DES HUMEURS\r\n     D'APRES H.

His\r\n\"Surgery\" was one of the most important text-books of the late Middle\r\nAges. There are many manuscripts of it, some fourteen editions in the\r\nfifteenth century and thirty-eight in the sixteenth, and it continued to\r\nbe reprinted far into the seventeenth century. He too was dominated\r\nby the surgery of the Arabs, and on nearly every page one reads of\r\nthe sages Avicenna, Albucasis or Rhazes. He lays down four conditions\r\nnecessary for the making of a surgeon--the first is that he must be\r\nlearned, the second, expert, the third that he should be clever, and the\r\nfourth that he should be well disciplined.\r\n\r\nYou will find a very discerning sketch of the relation of these two men\r\nto the history of surgery in the address given at the St. Louis Congress\r\nin 1904 by Sir Clifford Allbutt.(20) They were strong men with practical\r\nminds and good hands, whose experience taught them wisdom. In both there\r\nwas the blunt honesty that so often characterizes a good surgeon, and I\r\ncommend to modern surgeons de Mondeville's saying: \"If you have operated\r\nconscientiously on the rich for a proper fee, and on the poor for\r\ncharity, you need not play the monk, nor make pilgrimages for your\r\nsoul.\"\r\n\r\n     (20) Allbutt:  Historical Relations of Medicine and Surgery,\r\n     London, Macmillan Co., 1905.\r\n\r\nOne other great mediaeval physician may be mentioned, Peter of Abano (a\r\nsmall town near Padua, famous for its baths). He is the first in a long\r\nline of distinguished physicians connected with the great school of\r\nPadua. Known as \"the Conciliator,\" from his attempt to reconcile the\r\ndiverse views on philosophy and medicine, he had an extraordinary\r\nreputation as a practitioner and author, the persistence of which\r\nis well illustrated by the fact that eight of the one hundred and\r\neighty-two medical books printed before 1481 were from his pen. He seems\r\nto have taught medicine in Paris, Bologna and Padua. He was a devoted\r\nastrologer, had a reputation among the people as a magician and, like\r\nhis contemporary, Arnold of Villanova, came into conflict with the\r\nChurch and appears to have been several times before the Inquisition;\r\nindeed it is said that he escaped the stake only by a timely death.\r\nHe was a prolific commentator on Aristotle, and his exposition of the\r\n\"problems\" had a great vogue. The early editions of his texts are among\r\nthe most superb works ever printed. He outlived his reputation as a\r\nmagician, and more than a century after his death Frederick, Duke of\r\nUrbino, caused his effigies to be set up over the gate of the palace at\r\nPadua with this inscription:\r\n\r\n     PETRUS APONUS PATAVINUS PHILOSOPHIAE MEDICINAEQUE\r\n     SCIENTISSIMUS, OB IDQUE, CONCILIATORIS NOMEN\r\n     ADEPTUS, ASTROLOGIAE VERO ADEO PERITUS,\r\n     UT IN MAGIAE SUSPICIONEM INCIDERIT,\r\n     FALSOQUE DE HAERESI POSTULATUS,\r\n     ABSOLUTUS FUERIT.(21)\r\n\r\n     (21) Naude:  History of Magick, London, 1657, p. 182, or the\r\n     original: Apologie pour les grands hommes soupconnez de magic,\r\n     e.g., ed. Amst., 1719, p. 275.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Abano caused to be painted the astronomical figures in\r\nthe great hall of the palace at Padua.\r\n\r\nOne characteristic of mediaeval medicine is its union with theology,\r\nwhich is not remarkable, as the learning of the time was chiefly in\r\nthe hands of the clergy. One of the most popular works, the \"Thesaurus\r\nPauperum,\" was written by Petrus Hispanus, afterwards Pope John XXI.\r\nWe may judge of the pontifical practice from the page here reproduced,\r\nwhich probably includes, under the term \"iliac passion,\" all varieties\r\nof appendicitis.\r\n\r\nFor our purpose two beacons illuminate the spirit of the thirteenth\r\ncentury in its outlook on man and nature. Better than Abelard or St.\r\nThomas Aquinas, and much better than any physicians, Albertus Magnus and\r\nRoger Bacon represent the men who were awake to greet the rising of the\r\nsun of science. What a contrast in their lives and in their works! The\r\ngreat Dominican's long life was an uninterrupted triumph of fruitful\r\naccomplishment--the titanic task he set himself was not only completed\r\nbut was appreciated to the full by his own generation--a life not only\r\nof study and teaching, but of practical piety. As head of the order in\r\nGermany and Bishop of Regensburg, he had wide ecclesiastical influence;\r\nand in death he left a memory equalled only by one or two of his\r\ncentury, and excelled only by his great pupil, Thomas Aquinas. There are\r\nmany Alberts in history--the Good, the Just, the Faithful--but there is\r\nonly one we call \"Magnus\" and he richly deserved the name. What is his\r\nrecord? Why do we hold his name in reverence today?\r\n\r\nAlbertus Magnus was an encyclopaedic student and author, who took all\r\nknowledge for his province. His great work and his great ambition was to\r\ninterpret Aristotle to his generation. Before his day, the Stagirite was\r\nknown only in part, but he put within the reach of his contemporaries\r\nthe whole science of Aristotle, and imbibed no small part of his spirit.\r\nHe recognized the importance of the study of nature, even of testing\r\nit by way of experiment, and in the long years that had elapsed since\r\nTheophrastus no one else, except Dioscorides, had made so thorough\r\na study of botany. His paraphrases of the natural history books\r\nof Aristotle were immensely popular, and served as a basis for all\r\nsubsequent studies. Some of his medical works had an extraordinary\r\nvogue, particularly the \"De Secretis Mulierum\" and the \"De Virtutibus\r\nHerbarum,\" but there is some doubt as to the authorship of the first\r\nnamed, although Jammy and Borgnet include it in the collected editions\r\nof his works. So fabulous was his learning that he was suspected of\r\nmagic and comes in Naude's list of the wise men who have unjustly\r\nbeen reputed magicians. Ferguson tells(22) that \"there is in actual\r\ncirculation at the present time a chapbook . . . containing charms,\r\nreceipts, sympathetical and magicalcures for man and animals, . . .\r\nwhich passes under the name of Albertus.\" But perhaps the greatest claim\r\nof Albertus to immortality is that he was the teacher and inspirer\r\nof Thomas Aquinas, the man who undertook the colossal task of fusing\r\nAristotelian philosophy with Christian theology, and with such success\r\nthat the \"angelic doctor\" remains today the supreme human authority of\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n     (22) Bibliotheca Chemica, 1906, Vol. I, p. 15.\r\n\r\nA man of much greater interest to us from the medical point of view is\r\nRoger Bacon and for two reasons. More than any other mediaeval mind he\r\nsaw the need of the study of nature by a new method. The man who could\r\nwrite such a sentence as this: \"Experimental science has three great\r\nprerogatives over other sciences; it verifies conclusions by direct\r\nexperiment; it discovers truth which they never otherwise would reach;\r\nit investigates the course of nature and opens to us a knowledge of the\r\npast and of the future,\" is mentally of our day and generation. Bacon\r\nwas born out of due time, and his contemporaries had little sympathy\r\nwith his philosophy, and still less with his mechanical schemes and\r\ninventions. From the days of the Greeks, no one had had so keen an\r\nappreciation of what experiment meant in the development of human\r\nknowledge, and he was obsessed with the idea, so commonplace to us, that\r\nknowledge should have its utility and its practical bearing. \"His chief\r\nmerit is that he was one of the first to point the way to original\r\nresearch--as opposed to the acceptance of an authority--though he\r\nhimself still lacked the means of pursuing this path consistently. His\r\ninability to satisfy this impulse led to a sort of longing, which is\r\nexpressed in the numerous passages in his works where he anticipates\r\nman's greater mastery over nature.\"(23)\r\n\r\n     (23) Dannemann: Die Naturwissenschaften in ihrer Entwicklung und\r\n     in ibrem Zusammenhange, Leipzig, 1910, Vol. I, pp. 278-279.\r\n\r\nBacon wrote a number of medical treatises, most of which remain in\r\nmanuscript. His treatise on the \"Cure of Old Age and the Preservation of\r\nYouth\" was printed in English in 1683.(24) His authorities were largely\r\nArabian. One of his manuscripts is \"On the Bad Practices of Physicians.\"\r\nOn June 10, 1914, the eve of his birth, the septencentenary of Roger\r\nBacon will be celebrated by Oxford, the university of which he is the\r\nmost distinguished ornament. His unpublished MSS. in the Bodleian will\r\nbe issued by the Clarendon Press (1915-1920), and it is hoped that his\r\nunpublished medical writings will be included.\r\n\r\n     (24) It may be interesting to note the three causes to which he\r\n     attributes old age:  \"As the World waxeth old, Men grow old with\r\n     it: not by reason of the Age of the World, but because of the\r\n     great Increase of living Creatures, which infect the very Air,\r\n     that every way encompasseth us, and Through our Negligence in\r\n     ordering our Lives, and That great Ignorance of the Properties\r\n     which are in things conducing to Health, which might help a\r\n     disordered way of Living, and might supply the defect of due\r\n     Government.\"\r\n\r\nWhat would have been its fate if the mind of Europe had been ready for\r\nRoger Bacon's ferment, and if men had turned to the profitable studies\r\nof physics, astronomy and chemistry instead of wasting centuries over\r\nthe scholastic philosophy and the subtleties of Duns Scotus, Abelard and\r\nThomas Aquinas? Who can say? Make no mistake about the quality of these\r\nmen--giants in intellect, who have had their place in the evolution of\r\nthe race; but from the standpoint of man struggling for the mastery of\r\nthis world they are like the members of Swift's famous college \"busy\r\ndistilling sunshine from cucumbers.\" I speak, of course, from the\r\nposition of the natural man, who sees for his fellows more hope from the\r\nexperiments of Roger Bacon than from the disputations of philosophy on\r\nthe \"Instants, Familiarities, Quiddities and Relations,\" which so roused\r\nthe scorn of Erasmus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDIAEVAL MEDICAL STUDIES\r\n\r\nIT will be of interest to know what studies were followed at a mediaeval\r\nuniversity. At Oxford, as at most of the continental universities, there\r\nwere three degrees, those of Bachelor, Licentiate and Doctor. The books\r\nread were the \"Tegni\" of Galen, the \"Aphorisms\" of Hippocrates, the \"De\r\nFebribus\" of Isaac and the \"Antidotarium\" of Nicolaus Salernitanus: if\r\na graduate in arts, six years' study in all was required, in other\r\nfaculties, eight. One gets very full information on such matters from\r\na most interesting book, \"Une Chaire de Medecine au XVe Siecle,\" by Dr.\r\nFerrari (Paris, 1899). The University of Pavia was founded in 1361, and\r\nlike most of those in Italy was largely frequented by foreigners, who\r\nwere arranged, as usual, according to their nationalities; but the\r\nstudents do not appear to have controlled the university quite so much\r\nas at Bologna. The documents of the Ferrari family, on which the work is\r\nbased, tell the story of one of its members, who was professor at Pavia\r\nfrom 1432 to 1472. One is surprised at the range of studies in certain\r\ndirections, and still more at the absence of other subjects. A list is\r\ngiven of the teachers in medicine for the year 1433, twenty in all, and\r\nthere were special lectures for the morning, afternoon and evening. The\r\nsubjects are medicine, practical medicine, physics, metaphysics, logic,\r\nastrology, surgery and rhetoric: very striking is the omission of\r\nanatomy, which does not appear in the list even in 1467. The salaries\r\npaid were not large, so that most of the teachers must have been in\r\npractice: four hundred and five hundred florins was the maximum.\r\n\r\nThe dominance of the Arabians is striking. In 1467, special lectures\r\nwere given on the \"Almansor\" of Rhazes, and in the catalogue of\r\nthe Ferrari's library more than one half of the books are Arabian\r\ncommentaries on Greek medicine. Still more striking evidence of their\r\ninfluence is found in the text-book of Ferrari, which was printed in\r\n1471 and had been circulated earlier in MS. In it Avicenna is quoted\r\nmore than 3000 times, Rhazes and Galen 1000, Hippocrates only 140\r\ntimes. Professor Ferrari was a man who played an important role in\r\nthe university, and had a large consultation practice. You will be\r\ninterested to know what sort of advice he gave in special cases. I have\r\nthe record of an elaborate consultation written in his own hand, from\r\nwhich one may gather what a formidable thing it was to fall into the\r\nhands of a mediaeval physician. Signor John de Calabria had a digestive\r\nweakness of the stomach, and rheumatic cerebral disease, combined with\r\nsuperfluous heat and dryness of the liver and multiplication of choler.\r\nThere is first an elaborate discussion on diet and general mode of life;\r\nthen he proceeds to draw up certain light medicines as a supplement,\r\nbut it must have taken an extensive apothecary's shop to turn out the\r\ntwenty-two prescriptions designed to meet every possible contingency.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties in the early days of the universities was to\r\nprocure good MSS. In the Paris Faculty, the records of which are the\r\nmost complete in Europe, there is an inventory for the year 1395 which\r\ngives a list of twelve volumes, nearly all by Arabian authors.(25)\r\nFranklin gives an interesting incident illustrating the rarity of\r\nmedical MSS. at this period. Louis XI, always worried about his health,\r\nwas anxious to have in his library the works of Rhazes. The only copy\r\navailable was in the library of the medical school. The manuscript was\r\nlent, but on excellent security, and it is nice to know that it was\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n     (25) Franklin:  Recherches sur la Bibliotheque de la Faculte de\r\n     Medecine de Paris, 1864.\r\n\r\nIt is said that one of the special advantages that Montpellier had over\r\nParis was its possession of so many important MSS., particularly\r\nthose of the Arabian writers. Many \"Compendia\" were written containing\r\nextracts from various writers, and no doubt these were extensively\r\ncopied and lent or sold to students. At Bologna and Padua, there were\r\nregulations as to the price of these MSS. The university controlled the\r\nproduction of them, and stationers were liable to fines for inaccurate\r\ncopies. The trade must have been extensive in those early days, as\r\nRashdall mentions that in 1323 there were twenty-eight sworn booksellers\r\nin Paris, besides keepers of bookstalls in the open air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDIAEVAL PRACTICE\r\n\r\nTHE Greek doctrine of the four humors colored all the conceptions of\r\ndisease; upon their harmony alone it was thought that health depended.\r\nThe four temperaments, sanguine, phlegmatic, bilious and melancholic,\r\ncorresponded with the prevalence of these humors. The body was composed\r\nof certain so-called \"naturals,\" seven in number--the elements,\r\nthe temperaments, the humors, the members or parts, the virtues\r\nor faculties, the operations or functions and the spirits. Certain\r\n\"non-naturals,\" nine in number, preserved the health of the body, viz.\r\nair, food and drink, movement and repose, sleeping and waking, excretion\r\nand retention, and the passions. Disease was due usually to alterations\r\nin the composition of the humors, and the indications for treatment were\r\nin accordance with these doctrines. They were to be evacuated, tenuated,\r\ncooled, heated, purged or strengthened. This humoral doctrine prevailed\r\nthroughout the Middle Ages, and reached far into modern times--indeed,\r\nechoes of it are still to be heard in popular conversations on the\r\nnature of disease.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians were famous for their vigor and resource in matters of\r\ntreatment. Bleeding was the first resort in a large majority of all\r\ndiseases. In the \"Practice\" of Ferrari there is scarcely a malady\r\nfor which it is not recommended. All remedies were directed to the\r\nregulation of the six non-naturals, and they either preserved health,\r\ncured the disease or did the opposite. The most popular medicines were\r\nderived from the vegetable kingdom, and as they were chiefly those\r\nrecommended by Galen, they were, and still are, called by his name.\r\nMany important mineral medicines were introduced by the Arabians,\r\nparticularly mercury, antimony, iron, etc. There were in addition scores\r\nof substances, the parts or products of animals, some harmless, others\r\nsalutary, others again useless and disgusting. Minor surgery was in the\r\nhands of the barbers, who performed all the minor operations, such as\r\nbleeding; the more important operations, few in number, were performed\r\nby surgeons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASTROLOGY AND DIVINATION\r\n\r\nAT this period astrology, which included astronomy, was everywhere\r\ntaught. In the \"Gouernaunce of Prynces, or Pryvete of Pryveties,\"\r\ntranslated by James Yonge, 1422,(26) there occurs the statement:\r\n\"As Galian the lull wies leche Saith and Isoder the Gode clerk, hit\r\nwitnessith that a man may not perfitely can the sciens and craft of\r\nMedissin but yef he be an astronomoure.\"\r\n\r\n     (26) Early English Text Society, Extra Series, No. LXXIV, p. 195,\r\n     1898; Secreta Secretorum, Rawl. MS. B., 490.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the practice of astrology spread from Babylonia and\r\nGreece throughout the Roman Empire. It was carried on into the Middle\r\nAges as an active and aggressive cult, looked upon askance at times\r\nby the Church, but countenanced by the courts, encouraged at the\r\nuniversities, and always by the public. In the curriculum of the\r\nmediaeval university, astronomy made up with music, arithmetic and\r\ngeometry the Quadrivium. In the early faculties, astronomy and astrology\r\nwere not separate, and at Bologna, in the early fourteenth century, we\r\nmeet with a professorship of astrology.(27) One of the duties of this\r\nsalaried professor, was to supply \"judgements\" gratis for the benefit of\r\nenquiring students, a treacherous and delicate assignment, as that most\r\ndistinguished occupant of the chair at Bologna, Cecco d'Ascoli, found\r\nwhen he was burned at the stake in 1357, a victim of the Florentine\r\nInquisition.(28)\r\n\r\n     (27) Rashdall:  Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages, Vol.\r\n     I, p. 240.\r\n\r\n     (28) Rashdall, l.c., Vol. I, p. 244.--Rashdall also mentions that\r\n     in the sixteenth century at Oxford there is an instance of a\r\n     scholar admitted to practice astrology. l.c., Vol. II, p. 458.\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon himself was a warm believer in judicial astrology and in the\r\ninfluence of the planets, stars and comets on generation, disease and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nMany of the stronger minds of the Renaissance broke away from the\r\nfollies of the subject. Thus Cornelius Agrippa in reply to the request\r\nof a friar to consult the stars on his behalf says:(29) \"Judicial\r\nastrology is nothing more than the fallacious guess of superstitious\r\nmen, who have founded a science on uncertain things and are deceived by\r\nit: so think nearly all the wise; as such it is ridiculed by some most\r\nnoble philosophers; Christian theologians reject it, and it is condemned\r\nby sacred councils of the Church. Yet you, whose office it is to\r\ndissuade others from these vanities, oppressed, or rather blinded by I\r\nknow not what distress of mind, flee to this as to a sacred augur, and\r\nas if there were no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of the god\r\nof Ekron.\"\r\n\r\n     (29) H. Morley:  The Life of Henry Cornelius Agrippa, London,\r\n     1856, Vol. II, p. 138.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the opposition of the Church astrology held its own; many of\r\nthe universities at the end of the fifteenth century published almanacs,\r\nusually known as \"Prognosticons,\" and the practice was continued far\r\ninto the sixteenth century. I show you here an illustration. Rabelais,\r\nyou may remember, when physician to the Hotel Dieu in Lyons, published\r\nalmanacs for the years 1533, 1535, 1541, 1546. In the title-page he\r\ncalled himself \"Doctor of Medicine and Professor of Astrology,\" and they\r\ncontinued to be printed under his name until 1556. In the preparation\r\nof these he must have had his tongue in his cheek, as in his famous\r\n\"Pantagrueline Prognostication,\" in which, to satisfy the curiosity of\r\nall good companions, he had turned over all the archives of the heavens,\r\ncalculated the quadratures of the moon, hooked out all that has ever\r\nbeen thought by all the Astrophils, Hypernephilists, Anemophylakes,\r\nUranopets and Ombrophori, and felt on every point with Empedocles.(30)\r\n\r\n     (30) Pantagrueline Prognostication, Rabelais, W. F. Smith's\r\n     translation, 1893, Vol. II, p. 460.\r\n\r\nEven physicians of the most distinguished reputation practised judicial\r\nastrology. Jerome Cardan was not above earning money by casting\r\nhoroscopes, and on this subject he wrote one of his most popular books\r\n(De Supplemento Almanach, etc., 1543), in which astronomy and\r\nastrology are mixed in the truly mediaeval fashion. He gives in it some\r\nsixty-seven nativities, remarkable for the events they foretell, with an\r\nexposition. One of the accusations brought against him was that he had\r\n\"attempted to subject to the stars the Lord of the stars and cast our\r\nSaviour's horoscope.\"(31) Cardan professed to have abandoned a practice\r\nlooked upon with disfavor both by the Church and by the universities,\r\nbut he returned to it again and again. I show here his own horoscope.\r\nThat remarkable character, Michael Servetus, the discoverer of the\r\nlesser circulation, when a fellow student with Vesalius at Paris, gave\r\nlectures upon judicial astrology, which brought him into conflict with\r\nthe faculty; and the rarest of the Servetus works, rarer even than\r\nthe \"Christianismi Restitutio,\" is the \"Apologetica disceptatio pro\r\nastrologia,\" one copy of which is in the Bibliotheque Nationale. Nor\r\ncould the new astronomy and the acceptance of the heliocentric views\r\ndislocate the popular belief. The literature of the seventeenth century\r\nis rich in astrological treatises dealing with medicine.\r\n\r\n     (31) De Thou, Lib. LXII, quoted by Morley in Life of Jerome\r\n     Cardan, Vol. II, p. 294.\r\n\r\nNo one has ever poured such satire upon the mantic arts as did Rabelais\r\nin chapter twenty-five of the third book of \"Pantagruel.\" Panurge goes\r\nto consult Her Trippa--the famous Cornelius Agrippa, whose opinion\r\nof astrology has already been quoted, but who nevertheless, as court\r\nastrologer to Louise of Savoy, had a great contemporary reputation.\r\nAfter looking Panurge in the face and making conclusions by metoposcopy\r\nand physiognomy, he casts his horoscope secundum artem, then, taking a\r\nbranch of tamarisk, a favorite tree from which to get the divining\r\nrod, he names some twenty-nine or thirty mantic arts, from pyromancy to\r\nnecromancy, by which he offers to predict his future. While full of rare\r\nhumor, this chapter throws an interesting light on the extraordinary\r\nnumber of modes of divination that have been employed. Small wonder that\r\nPanurge repented of his visit! I show here the title-page of a popular\r\nbook by one of the most famous of the English astrological physicians,\r\nNicholas Culpeper.\r\n\r\nNever was the opinion of sensible men on this subject better expressed\r\nthan by Sir Thomas Browne:(32) \"Nor do we hereby reject or condemn a\r\nsober and regulated Astrology; we hold there is more truth therein than\r\nin ASTROLOGERS; in some more than many allow, yet in none so much\r\nas some pretend. We deny not the influence of the Starres, but often\r\nsuspect the due application thereof; for though we should affirm that\r\nall things were in all things; that Heaven were but Earth Celestified,\r\nand earth but Heaven terrestrified, or that each part above had an\r\ninfluence upon its divided affinity below; yet how to single out these\r\nrelations, and duly to apply their actions, is a work ofttimes to be\r\neffected by some revelation, and Cabala from above, rather than any\r\nPhilosophy, or speculation here below.\"\r\n\r\n     (32) Sir Thomas Browne:  Pseudodoxia Epidemica, Bk. IV, Chap.\r\n     XIII. (Wilkin's ed., Vol. III, p. 84.)\r\n\r\nAs late as 1699, a thesis was discussed at the Paris Faculty, \"Whether\r\ncomets were harbingers of disease,\" and in 1707 the Faculty negatived\r\nthe question propounded in a thesis, \"Whether the moon had any sway on\r\nthe human body.\"\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw, among intelligent men, a\r\nprogressive weakening of the belief in the subject; but not even the\r\nsatire of Swift, with his practical joke in predicting and announcing\r\nthe death of the famous almanac maker, nor contemptuous neglect of the\r\nsubject of late years sufficed to dispel the belief from the minds of\r\nthe public. Garth in the Dispensary (1699) satirizes the astrological\r\npractitioners of his day:\r\n\r\n     The Sage in Velvet Chair, here lolls at Ease\r\n     To promise future Health for present Fees\r\n     Then as from Tripod solemn Sham reveals\r\n     And what the Stars know nothing of foretell. (Canto ii.)\r\n\r\nThe almanacs of Moore and Zadkiel continue to be published, and\r\nremain popular. In London, sandwich men are to be met with carrying\r\nadvertisements of Chaldeans and Egyptians who offer to tell your fortune\r\nby the stars. Even in this country, astrology is still practiced to\r\na surprising extent if one may judge from advertisements in certain\r\npapers, and from publications which must have a considerable sale. Many\r\nyears ago, I had as a patient an estimable astrologer, whose lucrative\r\nincome was derived from giving people astral information as to the rise\r\nand fall of stocks. It is a chapter in the vagaries of the human mind\r\nthat is worth careful study.(33) Let me commend to your reading the\r\nsympathetic story called \"A Doctor of Medicine\" in the \"Rewards and\r\nFairies\" of Kipling. The hero is Nicholas Culpeper, Gent., whose picture\r\nis here given. One stanza of the poem at the end of the story, \"Our\r\nFathers of Old,\" may be quoted:\r\n\r\n     Wonderful tales had our fathers of old--\r\n     Wonderful tales of the herbs and the stars--\r\n     The Sun was Lord of the Marigold,\r\n     Basil and Rocket belonged to Mars.\r\n     Pat as a sum in division it goes--\r\n     (Every plant had a star bespoke)--\r\n     Who but Venus should govern the Rose?\r\n     Who but Jupiter own the Oak?\r\n     Simply and gravely the facts are told\r\n     In the wonderful books of our fathers of old.\r\n\r\n     (33) It is not generally known that Stonewall Jackson practiced\r\n     astrology. Col. J. W. Revere in \"Keel and Saddle\" (Boston, 1872)\r\n     tells of meeting Jackson in 1852 on a Mississippi steamer and\r\n     talking with him on the subject. Some months later, Revere\r\n     received a letter from Jackson enclosing his (Revere's)\r\n     horoscope.  There was a \"culmination of the malign aspect during\r\n     the first days of May, 1863--both will be exposed to a common\r\n     danger at the time indicated.\"  At the battle of\r\n     Chancellorsville, May 9, 1863, Revere saw Jackson mortally\r\n     wounded!\r\n\r\nJames J. Walsh of New York has written a book of extraordinary interest\r\ncalled \"The Thirteenth, Greatest of Centuries.\" I have not the necessary\r\nknowledge to say whether he has made out his case or not for art and for\r\nliterature. There was certainly a great awakening and, inspired by high\r\nideals, men turned with a true instinct to the belief that there was\r\nmore in life than could be got out of barren scholastic studies. With\r\nmany of the strong men of the period one feels the keenest mental\r\nsympathy. Grosseteste, the great Clerk of Lincoln, as a scholar, a\r\nteacher and a reformer, represents a type of mind that could grow\r\nonly in fruitful soil. Roger Bacon may be called the first of\r\nthe moderns--certainly the first to appreciate the extraordinary\r\npossibilities which lay in a free and untrammelled study of nature.\r\nA century which could produce men capable of building the Gothic\r\ncathedrals may well be called one of the great epochs in history, and\r\nthe age that produced Dante is a golden one in literature. Humanity has\r\nbeen the richer for St. Francis; and Abelard, Albertus and Aquinas form\r\na trio not easy to match, in their special departments, either before or\r\nafter. But in science, and particularly in medicine, and in the advance\r\nof an outlook upon nature, the thirteenth century did not help man very\r\nmuch. Roger Bacon was \"a voice crying in the wilderness,\" and not one of\r\nthe men I have picked out as specially typical of the period instituted\r\nany new departure either in practice or in science. They were servile\r\nfollowers, when not of the Greeks, of the Arabians. This is attested by\r\nthe barrenness of the century and a half that followed. One would have\r\nthought that the stimulus given by Mundinus to the study of anatomy\r\nwould have borne fruit, but little was done in science during the two\r\nand a half centuries that followed the delivery of his lectures and\r\nstill less in the art. While William of Wykeham was building Winchester\r\nCathedral and Chaucer was writing the Canterbury Tales, John of\r\nGaddesden in practice was blindly following blind leaders whose\r\nauthority no one dared question.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, from the modern standpoint the thirteenth was not the\r\ntrue dawn brightening more and more unto the perfect day, but a glorious\r\naurora which flickered down again into the arctic night of mediaevalism.\r\n\r\nTo sum up--in medicine the Middle Ages represent a restatement from\r\ncentury to century of the facts and theories of the Greeks modified here\r\nand there by Arabian practice. There was, in Francis Bacon's phrase,\r\nmuch iteration, small addition. The schools bowed in humble, slavish\r\nsubmission to Galen and Hippocrates, taking everything from them but\r\ntheir spirit and there was no advance in our knowledge of the structure\r\nor function of the body. The Arabians lit a brilliant torch from Grecian\r\nlamps and from the eighth to the eleventh centuries the profession\r\nreached among them a position of dignity and importance to which it is\r\nhard to find a parallel in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV -- THE RENAISSANCE AND THE RISE OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY\r\n\r\nTHE \"reconquest of the classic world of thought was by far the most\r\nimportant achievement of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\r\nIt absorbed nearly the whole mental energy of the Italians.... The\r\nrevelation of what men were and what they wrought under the influence of\r\nother faiths and other impulses, in distant ages with a different ideal\r\nfor their aim, not only widened the narrow horizon of the Middle Ages,\r\nbut it also restored self-confidence to the reason of humanity.\"(1)\r\n\r\n     (1) J. A. Symonds:  The Renaissance in Italy; the Revival of\r\n     Learning, 1877, p. 52.\r\n\r\nEverywhere throughout the Middle Ages learning was the handmaid of\r\ntheology. Even Roger Bacon with his strong appeal for a new method\r\naccepted the dominant mediaeval conviction--that all the sciences did\r\nbut minister to their queen, Theology. A new spirit entered man's heart\r\nas he came to look upon learning as a guide to the conduct of life.\r\nA revolution was slowly effected in the intellectual world. It is\r\na mistake to think of the Renaissance as a brief period of sudden\r\nfruitfulness in the North Italian cities. So far as science is\r\nconcerned, the thirteenth century was an aurora followed by a long\r\nperiod of darkness, but the fifteenth was a true dawn that brightened\r\nmore and more unto the perfect day. Always a reflex of its period,\r\nmedicine joined heartily though slowly in the revolt against\r\nmediaevalism. How slowly I did not appreciate until recently. Studying\r\nthe earliest printed medical works to catch the point of view of the men\r\nwho were in the thick of the movement up to 1480--which may be taken to\r\ninclude the first quarter of a century of printing--one gets a startling\r\nrecord. The mediaeval mind still dominates: of the sixty-seven\r\nauthors of one hundred and eighty-two editions of early medical books,\r\ntwenty-three were men of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, thirty\r\nmen of the fifteenth century, eight wrote in Arabic, several were of\r\nthe School of Salernum, and only six were of classical antiquity, viz.,\r\nPliny (first 1469), Hippocrates (1473) (Hain (*)7247), Galen (1475)\r\n(Hain 7237), Aristotle (1476), Celsus (1478), and Dioscorides\r\n(1478).(**)\r\n\r\n     (*) This asterisk is used by Hain to indicate that he had seen a\r\n     copy.--Ed.\r\n\r\n     (**) Data added to a manuscript taken from the author's summary\r\n     on \"Printed Medical Books to 1480\" in Transactions of the\r\n     Bibliographical Society, London, 1916, XIII, 5-8, revised from\r\n     its \"News-Sheet\" (February, 1914). \"Of neither Hippocrates nor\r\n     Galen is there an early edition; but in 1473 at Pavia appeared an\r\n     exposition of the Aphorisms of Hippoerates, and in 1475 at Padua\r\n     an edition of the Tegni or Notes of Galen.\"  Ibid., p. 6.\r\n     Osler's unfinished Illustrated Monograph on this subject is now\r\n     being printed for the Society of which he was President.--Ed.\r\n\r\nThe medical profession gradually caught the new spirit. It has been well\r\nsaid that Greece arose from the dead with the New Testament in the one\r\nhand and Aristotle in the other. There was awakened a perfect passion\r\nfor the old Greek writers, and with it a study of the original\r\nsources, which had now become available in many manuscripts. Gradually\r\nHippocrates and Galen came to their own again. Almost every professor\r\nof medicine became a student of the MSS. of Aristotle and of the Greek\r\nphysicians, and before 1530 the presses had poured out a stream of\r\neditions. A wave of enthusiasm swept over the profession, and the best\r\nenergies of its best minds were devoted to a study of the Fathers. Galen\r\nbecame the idol of the schools. A strong revulsion of feeling arose\r\nagainst the Arabians, and Avicenna, the Prince, who had been clothed\r\nwith an authority only a little less than divine, became anathema. Under\r\nthe leadership of the Montpellier School, the Arabians made a strong\r\nfight, but it was a losing battle all along the line. This group\r\nof medical humanists--men who were devoted to the study of the old\r\nhumanities, as Latin and Greek were called--has had a great and\r\nbeneficial influence upon the profession. They were for the most part\r\ncultivated gentlemen with a triple interest--literature, medicine and\r\nnatural history. How important is the part they played may be gathered\r\nfrom a glance at the \"Lives\" given by Bayle in his \"Biographic Medicale\"\r\n(Paris, 1855) between the years 1500 and 1575. More than one half of\r\nthem had translated or edited works of Hippocrates or Galen; many of\r\nthem had made important contributions to general literature, and a large\r\nproportion of them were naturalists: Leonicenus, Linacre, Champier,\r\nFernel, Fracastorius, Gonthier, Caius, J. Sylvius, Brasavola, Fuchsius,\r\nMatthiolus, Conrad Gesner, to mention only those I know best, form a\r\ngreat group. Linacre edited Greek works for Aldus, translated works\r\nof Galen, taught Greek at Oxford, wrote Latin grammars and founded\r\nthe Royal College of Physicians.(*) Caius was a keen Greek scholar,\r\nan ardent student of natural history, and his name is enshrined as\r\nco-founder of one of the most important of the Cambridge colleges.\r\nGonthier, Fernel, Fuchs and Mattioli were great scholars and greater\r\nphysicians. Champier, one of the most remarkable of the group, was\r\nthe founder of the Hotel Dieu at Lyons, and author of books of a\r\ncharacteristic Renaissance type and of singular bibliographical\r\ninterest. In many ways greatest of all was Conrad Gesner, whose mors\r\ninopinata at forty-nine, bravely fighting the plague, is so touchingly\r\nand tenderly mourned by his friend Caius.(2) Physician, botanist,\r\nmineralogist, geologist, chemist, the first great modern bibliographer,\r\nhe is the very embodiment of the spirit of the age.(2a) On the flyleaf\r\nof my copy of the \"Bibliotheca Universalis\" (1545), is written a fine\r\ntribute to his memory. I do not know by whom it is, but I do know from\r\nmy reading that it is true:\r\n\r\n     (*) Cf.  Osler:  Thomas Linacre, Cambridge University Press,\r\n     1908.--Ed.\r\n\r\n     (2) Joannis Caii Britanni de libris suis, etc., 1570.\r\n\r\n     (2a) See J. C. Bay:  Papers Bibliog.

Gesner was not only the best naturalist among the\r\nscholars of his day, but of all men of that century he was the pattern\r\nman of letters. He was faultless in private life, assiduous in study,\r\ndiligent in maintaining correspondence and good-will with learned men in\r\nall countries, hospitable--though his means were small--to every scholar\r\nthat came into Zurich. Prompt to serve all, he was an editor of other\r\nmen's volumes, a writer of prefaces for friends, a suggestor to young\r\nwriters of books on which they might engage themselves, and a great\r\nhelper to them in the progress of their work. But still, while finding\r\ntime for services to other men, he could produce as much out of his own\r\nstudy as though he had no part in the life beyond its walls.\"\r\n\r\nA large majority of these early naturalists and botanists were\r\nphysicians.(3) The Greek art of observation was revived in a study of\r\nthe scientific writings of Aristotle, Theophrastus and Dioscorides and\r\nin medicine, of Hippocrates and of Galen, all in the Greek originals.\r\nThat progress was at first slow was due in part to the fact that the\r\nleaders were too busy scraping the Arabian tarnish from the pure gold of\r\nGreek medicine and correcting the anatomical mistakes of Galen to bother\r\nmuch about his physiology or pathology. Here and there among the great\r\nanatomists of the period we read of an experiment, but it was the art of\r\nobservation, the art of Hippocrates, not the science of Galen, not the\r\ncarefully devised experiment to determine function, that characterized\r\ntheir work. There was indeed every reason why men should have been\r\ncontent with the physiology and pathology of that day, as, from a\r\ntheoretical standpoint, it was excellent. The doctrine of the four\r\nhumors and of the natural, animal and vital spirits afforded a ready\r\nexplanation for the symptoms of all diseases, and the practice of the\r\nday was admirably adapted to the theories. There was no thought of, no\r\ndesire for, change. But the revival of learning awakened in men at\r\nfirst a suspicion and at last a conviction that the ancients had left\r\nsomething which could be reached by independent research, and gradually\r\nthe paralytic-like torpor passed away.\r\n\r\n     (3) Miall:  The Early Naturalists, London, 1912.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries did three things in\r\nmedicine--shattered authority, laid the foundation of an accurate\r\nknowledge of the structure of the human body and demonstrated how its\r\nfunctions should be studied intelligently--with which advances, as\r\nillustrating this period, may be associated the names of Paracelsus,\r\nVesalius and Harvey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARACELSUS\r\n\r\nPARACELSUS is \"der Geist der stets verneint.\" He roused men against the\r\ndogmatism of the schools, and he stimulated enormously the practical\r\nstudy of chemistry. These are his great merits, against which must be\r\nplaced a flood of hermetical and transcendental medicine, some his own,\r\nsome foisted in his name, the influence of which is still with us.\r\n\r\n\"With what judgment ye judge it shall be judged to you again\" is the\r\nverdict of three centuries on Paracelsus. In return for unmeasured abuse\r\nof his predecessors and contemporaries he has been held up to obloquy\r\nas the arch-charlatan of history. We have taken a cheap estimate of\r\nhim from Fuller and Bacon, and from a host of scurrilous scribblers\r\nwho debased or perverted his writings. Fuller(4) picked him out as\r\nexemplifying the drunken quack, whose body was a sea wherein the tide\r\nof drunkenness was ever ebbing and flowing--\"He boasted that shortly\r\nhe would order Luther and the Pope, as well as he had done Galen and\r\nHippocrates. He was never seen to pray, and seldome came to Church.\r\nHe was not onely skilled in naturall Magick (the utmost bounds whereof\r\nborder on the suburbs of hell) but is charged to converse constantly\r\nwith familiars. Guilty he was of all vices but wantonnesse: . . . \"\r\n\r\n     (4) Fuller:  The Holy and Profane State, Cambridge, 1642, p. 56.\r\n\r\nFrancis Bacon, too, says many hard things of him.(5)\r\n\r\n     (5) Bacon:  Of the Proficience and Advancement of Learning, Bk.\r\n     II, Pickering ed., London, 1840, p. 181.  Works, Spedding ed.,\r\n     III, 381.\r\n\r\nTo the mystics, on the other hand, he is Paracelsus the Great, the\r\ndivine, the most supreme of the Christian magi, whose writings are too\r\nprecious for science, the monarch of secrets, who has discovered the\r\nUniversal Medicine. This is illustrated in Browning's well-known poem\r\n\"Paracelsus,\" published when he was only twenty-one; than which there\r\nis no more pleasant picture in literature of the man and of his\r\naspirations. His was a \"searching and impetuous soul\" that sought to win\r\nfrom nature some startling secret--\". . . a tincture of force to flush\r\nold age with youth, or breed gold, or imprison moonbeams till they\r\nchange to opal shafts!\" At the same time with that capacity for\r\nself-deception which characterizes the true mystic he sought to cast\r\n\r\n     Light on a darkling race; save for that doubt,\r\n     I stood at first where all aspire at last\r\n     To stand:  the secret of the world was mine.\r\n     I knew, I felt (perception unexpressed,\r\n     Uncomprehended by our narrow thought,\r\n     But somehow felt and known in every shift\r\n     And change in the spirit,--nay, in every pore\r\n     Of the body, even)--what God is, what we are,\r\n     What life is--. . .(6)\r\n\r\n     (6) Robert Browning:  Paracelsus, closing speech.\r\n\r\nMuch has been done of late to clear up his story and his character.\r\nProfessor Sudhoff, of Leipzig, has made an exhaustive bibliographical\r\nstudy of his writings,(7) there have been recent monographs by Julius\r\nHartmann, and Professors Franz and Karl Strunz,(8) and a sympathetic\r\nsummary of his life and writings has been published by the late Miss\r\nStoddart.(9) Indeed there is at present a cult of Paracelsus. The\r\nhermetic and alchemical writings are available in English in the edition\r\nof A. E. Waite, London, 1894. The main facts of his life you can find\r\nin all the biographies. Suffice it here to say that he was born at\r\nEinsiedeln, near Zurich, in 1493, the son of a physician, from whom\r\nhe appears to have had his early training both in medicine and in\r\nchemistry. Under the famous abbot and alchemist, Trithemiusof Wurzburg,\r\nhe studied chemistry and occultism. After working in the mines at\r\nSchwatz he began his wanderings, during which he professes to have\r\nvisited nearly all the countries in Europe and to have reached India\r\nand China. Returning to Germany he began a triumphal tour of practice\r\nthrough the German cities, always in opposition to the medical faculty,\r\nand constantly in trouble. He undoubtedly performed many important\r\ncures, and was thought to have found the supreme secret of alchemistry.\r\nIn the pommel of his sword he was believed to carry a familiar spirit.\r\nSo dominant was his reputation that in 1527 he was called to the chair\r\nof physic in the University of Basel. Embroiled in quarrels after\r\nhis first year he was forced to leave secretly, and again began his\r\nwanderings through German cities, working, quarrelling, curing, and\r\ndying prematurely at Saltzburg in 1541--one of the most tragic figures\r\nin the history of medicine.\r\n\r\n     (7) Professor Sudhoff:  Bibliographia Paracelsica, Berlin, 1894,\r\n     1899.\r\n\r\n     (8) R.

Stoddart:  The Life of Paracelsus, London, John\r\n     Murray, 1911.\r\n\r\nParacelsus is the Luther of medicine, the very incarnation of the spirit\r\nof revolt. At a period when authority was paramount, and men blindly\r\nfollowed old leaders, when to stray from the beaten track in any field\r\nof knowledge was a damnable heresy, he stood out boldly for independent\r\nstudy and the right of private judgment. After election to the chair at\r\nBasel he at once introduced a startling novelty by lecturing in German.\r\nHe had caught the new spirit and was ready to burst all bonds both in\r\nmedicine and in theology. He must have startled the old teachers and\r\npractitioners by his novel methods. \"On June 5, 1527, he attached a\r\nprogramme of his lectures to the black-board of the University inviting\r\nall to come to them. It began by greeting all students of the art of\r\nhealing. He proclaimed its lofty and serious nature, a gift of God to\r\nman, and the need of developing it to new importance and to new renown.\r\nThis he undertook to do, not retrogressing to the teaching of the\r\nancients, but progressing whither nature pointed, through research into\r\nnature, where he himself had discovered and had verified by prolonged\r\nexperiment and experience. He was ready to oppose obedience to old\r\nlights as if they were oracles from which one did not dare to differ.\r\nIllustrious doctor smight be graduated from books, but books made not a\r\nsingle physician.(10) Neither graduation, nor fluency, nor the knowledge\r\nof old languages, nor the reading of many books made a physician, but\r\nthe knowledge of things themselves and their properties. The business\r\nof a doctor was to know the different kinds of sicknesses, their\r\ncauses, their symptoms and their right remedies. This he would teach, for\r\nhe had won this knowledge through experience, the greatest teacher, and\r\nwith much toil. He would teach it as he had learned it, and his lectures\r\nwould be founded on works which he had composed concerning inward and\r\nexternal treatment, physic and surgery.\"(11) Shortly afterwards, at\r\nthe Feast of St. John, the students had a bonfire in front of the\r\nuniversity. Paracelsus came out holding in his hands the \"Bible of\r\nmedicine,\" Avicenna's \"Canon,\" which he flung into the flames saying:\r\n\"Into St. John's fire so that all misfortune may go into the air with\r\nthe smoke.\" It was, as he explained afterwards, a symbolic act: \"What\r\nhas perished must go to the fire; it is no longer fit for use: what is\r\ntrue and living, that the fire cannot burn.\" With abundant confidence in\r\nhis own capacity he proclaimed himself the legitimate monarch, the very\r\nChrist of medicine. \"You shall follow me,\" cried he, \"you, Avicenna,\r\nGalen, Rhasis, Montagnana, Mesues; you, Gentlemen of Paris, Montpellier,\r\nGermany, Cologne, Vienna, and whomsoever the Rhine and Danube nourish;\r\nyou who inhabit the isles of the sea; you, likewise, Dalmatians,\r\nAthenians; thou, Arab; thou, Greek; thou, Jew; all shall follow me, and\r\nthe monarchy shall be mine.\"(12)\r\n\r\n     (10) And men have oft grown old among their books\r\n     To die case hardened in their ignorance.\r\n\r\n     --Paracelsus, Browning.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (11) Anna M. Stoddart:  Life of Paracelsus, London, 1911, pp.\r\n     95-96.\r\n\r\n     (12) Browning's Paracelsus, London, 1835, p. 206 (note).\r\n\r\nThis first great revolt against the slavish authority of the schools had\r\nlittle immediate effect, largely on account of the personal vagaries of\r\nthe reformer--but it made men think. Paracelsus stirred the pool as had\r\nnot been done for fifteen centuries.\r\n\r\nMuch more important is the relation of Paracelsus to the new chemical\r\nstudies, and their relation to practical medicine. Alchemy, he held, \"is\r\nto make neither gold nor silver: its use is to make the supreme\r\nsciences and to direct them against disease.\" He recognized three\r\nbasic substances, sulphur, mercury and salt, which were the necessary\r\ningredients of all bodies organic or inorganic. They were the basis of\r\nthe three principles out of which the Archaeus, the spirit of nature,\r\nformed all bodies. He made important discoveries in chemistry; zinc, the\r\nvarious compounds of mercury, calomel, flowers of sulphur, among others,\r\nand he was a strong advocate of the use of preparations of iron and\r\nantimony. In practical pharmacy he has perhaps had a greater reputation\r\nfor the introduction of a tincture of opium--labdanum or laudanum--with\r\nwhich he effected miraculous cures, and the use of which he had probably\r\nlearned in the East.\r\n\r\nThrough Paracelsus a great stimulus was given to the study of chemistry\r\nand pharmacy, and he is the first of the modern iatro-chemists. In\r\ncontradistinction to Galenic medicines, which were largely derived\r\nfrom the vegetable kingdom, from this time on we find in the literature\r\nreferences to spagyric medicines and a \"spagyrist\" was a Paracelsian who\r\nregarded chemistry as the basis of all medical knowledge.\r\n\r\nOne cannot speak very warmly of the practical medical writings of\r\nParacelsus. Gout, which may be taken as the disease upon which he had\r\nthe greatest reputation, is very badly described, and yet he has one or\r\ntwo fruitful ideas singularly mixed with mediaeval astrology; but he\r\nhas here and there very happy insights, as where he remarks \"nec praeter\r\nsynoviam locqum alium ullum podagra occupat.\"(13) In the tract on\r\nphlebotomy I see nothing modern, and here again he is everywhere\r\ndominated by astrological ideas--\"Sapiens dominatur astris.\"\r\n\r\n     (13) Geneva ed., 1658, Vol. I, p. 613.\r\n\r\nAs a protagonist of occult philosophy, Paracelsus has had a more\r\nenduring reputation than as a physician. In estimating his position\r\nthere is the great difficulty referred to by Sudhoff in determining\r\nwhich of the extant treatises are genuine. In the two volumes issued in\r\nEnglish by Waite in 1894, there is much that is difficult to read and\r\nto appreciate from our modern standpoint. In the book \"Concerning Long\r\nLife\" he confesses that his method and practice will not be intelligible\r\nto common persons and that he writes only for those whose intelligence\r\nis above the average. To those fond of transcendental studies they\r\nappeal and are perhaps intelligible. Everywhere one comes across\r\nshrewd remarks which prove that Paracelsus had a keen belief in the\r\nall-controlling powers of nature and of man's capacity to make those\r\npowers operate for his own good: \"the wise man rules Nature, not Nature\r\nthe wise man.\" \"The difference between the Saint and the Magus is that\r\nthe one operates by means of God, and the other by means of Nature.\"\r\nHe had great faith in nature and the light of nature, holding that man\r\nobtains from nature according as he believes. His theory of the three\r\nprinciples appears to have controlled his conception of everything\r\nrelating to man, spiritually, mentally and bodily; and his threefold\r\ngenera of disease corresponded in some mysterious way with the three\r\nprimary substances, salt, sulphur and mercury.\r\n\r\nHow far he was a believer in astrology, charms and divination it is not\r\neasy to say. From many of the writings in his collected works one would\r\ngather, as I have already quoted, that he was a strong believer. On the\r\nother hand, in the \"Paramirum,\" he says: \"Stars control nothing in us,\r\nsuggest nothing, incline to nothing, own nothing; they are free from\r\nus and we are free from them\" (Stoddart, p. 185). The Archaeus, not the\r\nstars, controls man's destiny. \"Good fortune comes from ability, and\r\nability comes from the spirit\" (Archaeus).\r\n\r\nNo one has held more firmly the dualistic conception of the healing art.\r\nThere are two kinds of doctors; those who heal miraculously and those\r\nwho heal through medicine. Only he who believes can work miracles. The\r\nphysician has to accomplish that which God would have done miraculously,\r\nhad there been faith enough in the sick man (Stoddart, p. 194). He\r\nhad the Hippocratic conception of the \"vis medicatrix naturae\"--no one\r\nkeener since the days of the Greeks. Man is his own doctor and finds\r\nproper healing herbs in his own garden: the physician is in ourselves,\r\nin our own nature are all things that we need: and speaking of wounds,\r\nwith singular prescience he says that the treatment should be defensive\r\nso that no contingency from without could hinder Nature in her work\r\n(Stoddart, p. 213).\r\n\r\nParacelsus expresses the healing powers of nature by the word \"mumia,\"\r\nwhich he regarded as a sort of magnetic influence or force, and he\r\nbelieved that anyone possessing this could arrest or heal disease\r\nin others. As the lily breaks forth in invisible perfume, so healing\r\ninfluences may pass from an invisible body. Upon these views of\r\nParacelsus was based the theory of the sympathetic cure of disease\r\nwhich had an extraordinary vogue in the late sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies, and which is not without its modern counterpart.\r\n\r\nIn the next century, in Van Helmont we meet with the Archaeus everywhere\r\npresiding, controlling and regulating the animate and inanimate bodies,\r\nworking this time through agents, local ferments. The Rosicrucians had\r\ntheir direct inspiration from his writings, and such mystics as the\r\nEnglish Rosicrucian Fludd were strong Paracelsians.(14)\r\n\r\n     (14) Robert Fludd, the Mystical Physician, British Medical\r\n     Journal, London, 1897, ii, 408.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of contraries drawn from the old Greek philosophy,\r\nupon which a good deal of the treatment of Hippocrates and Galen was\r\nbased--dryness expelled by moisture, cold by heat, etc.--was opposed by\r\nParacelsus in favor of a theory of similars, upon which the practice of\r\nhomeopathy is based. This really arose from the primitive beliefs, to\r\nwhich I have already referred as leading to the use of eyebright in\r\ndiseases of the eye, and cyclamen in diseases of the ear because of its\r\nresemblance to that part; and the Egyptian organotherapy had the same\r\nbasis,--spleen would cure spleen, heart, heart, etc. In the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries these doctrines of sympathies and antipathies\r\nwere much in vogue. A Scotchman, Sylvester Rattray, edited in the\r\n\"Theatrum Sympatheticum\"(15) all the writings upon the sympathies and\r\nantipathies of man with animal, vegetable and mineral substances, and\r\nthe whole art of physics was based on this principle.\r\n\r\n     (15) Rattray:  Theatrum Sympatheticum, Norimberge, MDCLXII.\r\n\r\nUpon this theory of \"mumia,\" or magnetic force, the sympathetic cure of\r\ndisease was based. The weapon salve, the sympathetic ointment, and the\r\nfamous powder of sympathy were the instruments through which it acted.\r\nThe magnetic cure of wounds became the vogue. Van Helmont adopted these\r\nviews in his famous treatise \"De Magnetica Vulnerum Curatione,\"(16) in\r\nwhich he asserted that cures were wrought through magnetic influence.\r\nHow close they came to modern views of wound infection may be judged\r\nfrom the following: \"Upon the solution of Unity in any part the ambient\r\nair . . . repleted with various evaporations or aporrhoeas of mixt\r\nbodies, especially such as are then suffering the act of putrefaction,\r\nviolently invadeth the part and thereupon impresseth an exotic miasm or\r\nnoxious diathesis, which disposeth the blood successively arriving at\r\nthe wound, to putrefaction, by the intervention of fermentation.\" With\r\nhis magnetic sympathy, Van Helmont expressed clearly the doctrine of\r\nimmunity and the cure of disease by immune sera: \"For he who has once\r\nrecovered from that disease hath not only obtained a pure balsaamical\r\nblood, whereby for the future he is rendered free from any recidivation\r\nof the same evil, but also infallibly cures the same affection in his\r\nneighbour . . . and by the mysterious power of Magnetism transplants\r\nthat balsaam and conserving quality into the blood of another.\" He was\r\nrash enough to go further and say that the cures effected by the relics\r\nof the saints were also due to the same cause--a statement which led to\r\na great discussion with the theologians and to Van Helmont's arrest for\r\nheresy, and small wonder, when he makes such bold statements as \"Let the\r\nDivine enquire only concerning God, the Naturalist concerning Nature,\"\r\nand \"God in the production of miracles does for the most part walk hand\r\nin hand with Nature.\"\r\n\r\n     (16) An English translation by Walter Charleton appeared in 1650,\r\n     entitled \"A Ternary of Paradoxes.\"\r\n\r\nThat wandering genius, Sir Kenelm Digby, did much to popularize this\r\nmethod of treatment by his lecture on the \"Powder of Sympathy.\"(17) His\r\npowder was composed of copperas alone or mixed with gum tragacanth.\r\nHe regarded the cure as effected through the subtle influence of the\r\nsympathetic spirits or, as Highmore says, by \"atomicall energy wrought\r\nat a distance,\" and the remedy could be applied to the wound itself,\r\nor to a cloth soaked in the blood or secretions, or to the weapon that\r\ncaused the wound. One factor leading to success may have been that\r\nin the directions which Digby gave for treating the wound (in the\r\ncelebrated case of James Howell, for instance), it was to be let alone\r\nand kept clean. The practice is alluded to very frequently by the poets.\r\nIn the \"Lay of the Last Minstrel\" we find the following:\r\n\r\n     (17) French edition, 1668, English translation, same year. For a\r\n     discussion on the author of the weapon salve see Van Helmont, who\r\n     gives the various formulas.  Highmore (1651) says the \"powder is\r\n     a Zaphyrian salt calcined by a celestial fire operating in Leo\r\n     and Cancer into a Lunar complexion.\"\r\n\r\n     But she has ta'en the broken lance,\r\n     And wash'd it from the clotted gore,\r\n     And salved the splinter o'er and o'er.\r\n     William of Deloraine, in trance,\r\n     Whene'er she turn'd it round and round,\r\n     Twisted, as if she gall'd his wound,\r\n     Then to her maidens she did say,\r\n     That he should be whole man and sound,\r\n\r\n     (Canto iii, xxiii.)\r\n\r\nand in Dryden's \"Tempest\" (V, 1) Ariel says:\r\n\r\n     Anoint the Sword which pierc'd him with the Weapon-Salve,\r\n     And wrap it close from Air till I have time\r\n     To visit him again.\r\n\r\nFrom Van Helmont comes the famous story of the new nose that dropped off\r\nin sympathy with the dead arm from which it was taken, and the source\r\nof the famous lines of Hudibras. As I have not seen the original story\r\nquoted of late years it may be worth while to give it: \"A certain\r\ninhabitant of Bruxels, in a combat had his nose mowed off, addressed\r\nhimself to Tagliacozzus, a famous Chirurgein, living at Bononia, that he\r\nmight procure a new one; and when he feared the incision of his own arm,\r\nhe hired a Porter to admit it, out of whose arm, having first given\r\nthe reward agreed upon, at length he dig'd a new nose. About thirteen\r\nmoneths after his return to his own Countrey, on a sudden the ingrafted\r\nnose grew cold, putrified, and within few days drops off. To those of\r\nhis friends that were curious in the exploration of the cause of this\r\nunexpected misfortune, it was discovered, that the Porter expired,\r\nneer about the same punctilio of time, wherein the nose grew frigid and\r\ncadaverous. There are at Bruxels yet surviving, some of good repute, that\r\nwere eye-witnesses of these occurrences.\"(18)\r\n\r\n     (18) Charleton:  Of the Magnetic Cure of Wounds, London, 1650, p.\r\n     13.\r\n\r\nEqually in the history of science and of medicine, 1542 is a starred\r\nyear, marked by a revolution in our knowledge alike of Macrocosm and\r\nMicrocosm. In Frauenburg, the town physician and a canon, now nearing\r\nthe Psalmist limit and his end, had sent to the press the studies of a\r\nlifetime--\"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium.\" It was no new thought,\r\nno new demonstration that Copernicus thus gave to his generation.\r\nCenturies before, men of the keenest scientific minds from Pythagoras on\r\nhad worked out a heliocentric theory, fully promulgated by Aristarchus,\r\nand very generally accepted by the brilliant investigators of the\r\nAlexandrian school; but in the long interval, lapped in Oriental\r\nlethargy, man had been content to acknowledge that the heavens declare\r\nthe glory of God and that the firmament sheweth his handiwork. There\r\nhad been great astronomers before Copernicus. In the fifteenth century\r\nNicholas of Cusa and Regiomontanus had hinted at the heliocentric\r\ntheory; but 1512 marks an epoch in the history of science, since for all\r\ntime Copernicus put the problem in a way that compelled acquiescence.\r\n\r\nNor did Copernicus announce a truth perfect and complete, not to be\r\nmodified, but there were many contradictions and lacunae which the work\r\nof subsequent observers had to reconcile and fill up. For long years\r\nCopernicus had brooded over the great thoughts which his careful\r\nobservation had compelled. We can imagine the touching scene in the\r\nlittle town when his friend Osiander brought the first copy of the\r\nprecious volume hot from the press, a well enough printed book. Already\r\non his deathbed, stricken with a long illness, the old man must have had\r\ndoubts how his work would be received, though years before Pope Clement\r\nVII had sent him encouraging words. Fortunately death saved him from the\r\n\"rending\" which is the portion of so many innovators and discoverers.\r\nHis great contemporary reformer, Luther, expressed the view of the day\r\nwhen he said the fool will turn topsy-turvy the whole art of astronomy;\r\nbut the Bible says that Joshua commanded the Sun to stand still, not\r\nthe Earth. The scholarly Melanchthon, himself an astronomer, thought\r\nthe book so godless that he recommended its suppression (Dannemann,\r\nGrundriss). The church was too much involved in the Ptolemaic system to\r\naccept any change and it was not until 1822 that the works of Copernicus\r\nwere removed from the Index.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVESALIUS\r\n\r\nTHE same year, 1542, saw a very different picture in the far-famed city\r\nof Padua, \"nursery of the arts.\" The central figure was a man not yet in\r\nthe prime of life, and justly full of its pride, as you may see from\r\nhis portrait. Like Aristotle and Hippocrates cradled and nurtured in an\r\nAEsculapian family, Vesalius was from his childhood a student of nature,\r\nand was now a wandering scholar, far from his Belgian home. But in Italy\r\nhe had found what neither Louvain nor Paris could give, freedom in\r\nhis studies and golden opportunities for research in anatomy. What an\r\nimpression he must have made on the student body at Padua may be judged\r\nfrom the fact that shortly after his graduation in December, 1537,\r\nat the age of twenty-four, he was elected to the chair of anatomy and\r\nsurgery. Two things favored him--an insatiate desire to see and handle\r\nfor himself the parts of the human frame, and an opportunity, such as\r\nhad never before been offered to the teacher, to obtain material for the\r\nstudy of human anatomy. Learned with all the learning of the Grecians\r\nand of the Arabians, Vesalius grasped, as no modern before him had done,\r\nthe cardinal fact that to know the human machine and its working, it is\r\nnecessary first to know its parts--its fabric.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the work of this great man we must go back in a brief\r\nreview of the growth of the study of anatomy.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks only the Alexandrians knew human anatomy. What their\r\nknowledge was we know at second hand, but the evidence is plain that\r\nthey knew a great deal. Galen's anatomy was first-class and was based\r\non the Alexandrians and on his studies of the ape and the pig. We have\r\nalready noted how much superior was his osteology to that of Mundinus.\r\nBetween the Alexandrians and the early days of the School of Salernum we\r\nhave no record of systematic dissections of the human body. It is even\r\ndoubtful if these were permitted at Salernum. Neuburger states that the\r\ninstructions of Frederick II as to dissections were merely nominal.\r\n\r\nHow atrocious was the anatomy of the early Middle Ages may be gathered\r\nfrom the cuts in the works of Henri de Mondeville. In the Bodleian\r\nLibrary is a remarkable Latin anatomical treatise of the late thirteenth\r\ncentury, of English provenance, one illustration from which will suffice\r\nto show the ignorance of the author. Mundinus of Bologna, one of the\r\nfirst men in the Middle Ages to study anatomy from the subject, was\r\nunder the strong domination of the Arabians, from whom he appears to\r\nhave received a very imperfect Galenic anatomy. From this date we meet\r\nwith occasional dissections at various schools, but we have seen that in\r\nthe elaborate curriculum of the University of Padua in the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century there was no provision for the study of the subject.\r\nEven well into the sixteenth century dissections were not common, and\r\nthe old practice was followed of holding a professorial discourse,\r\nwhile the butcher, or barber surgeon, opened the cavities of the body. A\r\nmember of a famous Basel family of physicians, Felix Plater, has left\r\nus in his autobiography(19) details of the dissections he witnessed at\r\nMontpellier between November 14, 1552, and January 10, 1557, only eleven\r\nin number. How difficult it was at that time to get subjects is shown by\r\nthe risks they ran in \"body-snatching\" expeditions, of which he records\r\nthree.\r\n\r\n     (19) There is no work from which we can get a better idea of the\r\n     life of the sixteenth-century medical student and of the style of\r\n     education and of the degree ceremonies, etc.  Cumston has given\r\n     an excellent summary of it (Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin,\r\n     1912, XXIII, 105-113).\r\n\r\nAnd now came the real maker of modern anatomy. Andreas Vesalius had a\r\ngood start in life. Of a family long associated with the profession,\r\nhis father occupied the position of apothecary to Charles V, whom he\r\naccompanied on his journeys and campaigns. Trained at Louvain, he had,\r\nfrom his earliest youth, an ardent desire to dissect, and cut up mice\r\nand rats, and even cats and dogs. To Paris, the strong school of the\r\nperiod, he went in 1533, and studied under two men of great renown,\r\nJacob Sylvius and Guinterius. Both were strong Galenists and regarded\r\nthe Master as an infallible authority. He had as a fellow prosector,\r\nunder the latter, the unfortunate Servetus. The story of his troubles\r\nand trials in getting bones and subjects you may read in Roth's\r\n\"Life.\"(20) Many interesting biographical details are also to be found\r\nin his own writings. He returned for a time to Louvain, and here he\r\npublished his first book, a commentary on the \"Almansor\" of Rhazes, in\r\n1537.\r\n\r\n     (20) M. Roth:  Andreas Vesalius Bruxellensis, Berlin, 1892. An\r\n     excellent account of Vesalius and his contemporaries is given by\r\n     James Moores Ball in his superbly printed Andreas Vesalius, the\r\n     Reformer of Anatomy, St. Louis, 1910.\r\n\r\nFinding it difficult, either in Paris or Louvain, to pursue his\r\nanatomical studies, he decided to go to Italy where, at Venice and\r\nPadua, the opportunities were greater. At Venice, he attended the\r\npractice of a hospital (now a barracks) which was in charge of the\r\nTheatiner Order. I show you a photograph of the building taken last\r\nyear. And here a strange destiny brought two men together. In 1537,\r\nanother pilgrim was working in Venice waiting to be joined by his six\r\ndisciples. After long years of probation, Ignatius Loyola was ready to\r\nstart on the conquest of a very different world. Devoted to the sick\r\nand to the poor, he attached himself to the Theatiner Order, and in the\r\nwards of the hospital and the quadrangle, the fiery, dark-eyed, little\r\nBasque must frequently have come into contact with the sturdy young\r\nBelgian, busy with his clinical studies and his anatomy. Both were to\r\nachieve phenomenal success--the one in a few years to revolutionize\r\nanatomy, the other within twenty years to be the controller of\r\nuniversities, the counsellor of kings, and the founder of the most\r\nfamous order in the Roman Catholic Church. It was in this hospital that\r\nVesalius made observations on the China-root, on which he published a\r\nmonograph in 1546. The Paduan School was close to Venice and associated\r\nwith it, so that the young student had probably many opportunities of\r\ngoing to and fro. On the sixth of December, 1537, before he had reached\r\nhis twenty-fourth year and shortly after taking his degree, he was\r\nelected to the chair of surgery and anatomy at Padua.\r\n\r\nThe task Vesalius set himself to accomplish was to give an accurate\r\ndescription of all the parts of the human body, with proper\r\nillustrations. He must have had abundant material, more, probably, than\r\nany teacher before him had ever had at his disposal. We do not know\r\nwhere he conducted his dissections, as the old amphitheatre has\r\ndisappeared, but it must have been very different from the tiny one\r\nput up by his successor, Fabricius, in 1594. Possibly it was only a\r\ntemporary building, for he says in the second edition of the \"Fabrica\"\r\nthat he had a splendid lecture theatre which accommodated more than five\r\nhundred spectators (p. 681).\r\n\r\nWith Vesalius disappeared the old didactic method of teaching anatomy.\r\nHe did his own dissections, made his own preparations, and, when human\r\nsubjects were scarce, employed dogs, pigs or cats, and occasionally a\r\nmonkey. For five years he taught and worked at Padua. He is known\r\nto have given public demonstrations in Bologna and elsewhere. In the\r\n\"China-root\" he remarks that he once taught in three universities in one\r\nyear. The first fruit of his work is of great importance in connection\r\nwith the evolution of his knowledge. In 1538, he published six\r\nanatomical tables issued apparently in single leaves. Of the famous\r\n\"Tabulae Anatomicae\" only two copies are known, one in the San\r\nMarco Library, Venice, and the other in the possession of Sir John\r\nStirling-Maxwell, whose father had it reproduced in facsimile (thirty\r\ncopies only) in 1874. Some of the figures were drawn by Vesalius\r\nhimself, and some are from the pencil of his friend and countryman,\r\nStephan van Calcar. Those plates were extensively pirated. About this\r\ntime he also edited for the Giunti some of the anatomical works of\r\nGalen.(21)\r\n\r\n     (21) De anatomicis administrationibus, De venarum arterinrumque\r\n     dissectione, included in the various Juntine editions of Galen.\r\n\r\nWe know very little of his private life at Padua. His most important\r\ncolleague in the faculty was the famous Montanus, professor of medicine.\r\nAmong his students and associates was the Englishman Caius, who lived in\r\nthe same house with him. When the output is considered, he cannot have\r\nhad much spare time at Padua.\r\n\r\nHe did not create human anatomy--that had been done by the\r\nAlexandrians--but he studied it in so orderly and thorough a manner\r\nthat for the first time in history it could be presented in a way that\r\nexplained the entire structure of the human body. Early in 1542 the MS.\r\nwas ready; the drawings had been made with infinite care, the blocks for\r\nthe figures had been cut, and in September, he wrote to Oporinus urging\r\nthat the greatest pains should be taken with the book, that the paper\r\nshould be strong and of equal thickness, the workmen chosen for their\r\nskill, and that every detail of the pictures must be distinctly visible.\r\nHe writes with the confidence of a man who realized the significance of\r\nthe work he had done. It is difficult to speak in terms of moderation of\r\nthe \"Fabrica.\" To appreciate its relative value one must compare it with\r\nthe other anatomical works of the period, and for this purpose I\r\nput before you two figures from a text-book on the subject that was\r\navailable for students during the first half of the sixteenth century.\r\nIn the figures and text of the \"Fabrica\" we have anatomy as we know it;\r\nand let us be honest and say, too, largely as Galen knew it. Time will\r\nnot allow me to go into the question of the relations of these two\r\ngreat anatomists, but we must remember that at this period Galen ruled\r\nsupreme, and was regarded in the schools as infallible. And now, after\r\nfive years of incessant labor, Vesalius was prepared to leave his\r\nmuch loved Padua and his devoted students. He had accomplished an\r\nextraordinary work. He knew, I feel sure, what he had done. He knew that\r\nthe MSS. contained something that the world had not seen since the great\r\nPergamenian sent the rolls of his \"Manual of Anatomy\" among his friends.\r\nToo precious to entrust to any printer but the best--and the best in the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century was Transalpine--he was preparing to go\r\nnorth with the precious burden. We can picture the youthful teacher--he\r\nwas but twenty-eight--among students in a university which they\r\nthemselves controlled--some of them perhaps the very men who five years\r\nbefore had elected him--at the last meeting with his class, perhaps\r\ngiving a final demonstration of the woodcuts, which were of an accuracy\r\nand beauty never seen before by students' eyes, and reading his\r\nintroduction. There would be sad hearts at the parting, for never had\r\nanyone taught anatomy as he had taught it--no one had ever known anatomy\r\nas he knew it. But the strong, confident look was on his face and with\r\nthe courage of youth and sure of the future, he would picture a happy\r\nreturn to attack new and untried problems. Little did he dream that his\r\nhappy days as student and teacher were finished, that his work as an\r\nanatomist was over, that the most brilliant and epoch-making part of his\r\ncareer as a professor was a thing of the past. A year or more was spent\r\nat Basel with his friend Oporinus supervising the printing of the\r\ngreat work, which appeared in 1543 with the title \"De Humani Corporis\r\nFabrica.\" The worth of a book, as of a man, must be judged by results,\r\nand, so judged, the \"Fabrica\" is one of the great books of the world,\r\nand would come in any century of volumes which embraced the richest\r\nharvest of the human mind. In medicine, it represents the full flower\r\nof the Renaissance. As a book it is a sumptuous tome a worthy setting\r\nof his jewel--paper, type and illustration to match, as you may see for\r\nyourselves in this folio--the chef d'oeuvre of any medical library.\r\n\r\nIn every section, Vesalius enlarged and corrected the work of Galen.\r\nInto the details we need not enter: they are all given in Roth's\r\nmonograph, and it is a chapter of ancient history not specially\r\nilluminating.\r\n\r\nNever did a great piece of literary work have a better setting. Vesalius\r\nmust have had a keen appreciation of the artistic side of the art of\r\nprinting, and he must also have realized the fact that the masters of\r\nthe art had by this time moved north of the Alps.\r\n\r\nWhile superintending the printing of the precious work in the winter of\r\n1542-1543 in Basel, Vesalius prepared for the medical school a skeleton\r\nfrom the body of an executed man, which is probably the earliest\r\npreparation of the kind in Europe. How little anatomy had been studied\r\nat the period may be judged from that fact that there had been\r\nno dissection at Basel since 1531.(22) The specimen is now in the\r\nVesalianum, Basel, of which I show you a picture taken by Dr. Harvey\r\nCushing. From the typographical standpoint no more superb volume\r\non anatomy has been issued from any press, except indeed the second\r\nedition, issued in 1555. The paper is, as Vesalius directed, strong and\r\ngood, but it is not, as he asked, always of equal thickness; as a rule\r\nit is thick and heavy, but there are copies on a good paper of a much\r\nlighter quality. The illustrations drawn by his friend and fellow\r\ncountryman, van Calcar, are very much in advance of anything previously\r\nseen, except those of Leonardo. The title-page, one of the most\r\ncelebrated pictures in the history of medicine, shows Vesalius in\r\na large amphitheatre (an imaginary one of the artist, I am afraid)\r\ndissecting a female subject. He is demonstrating the abdomen to a group\r\nof students about the table, but standing in the auditorium are elderly\r\ncitizens and even women. One student is reading from an open book. There\r\nis a monkey on one side of the picture and a dog on the other. Above\r\nthe picture on a shield are the three weasels, the arms of Vesal. The\r\nreproduction which I show you here is from the \"Epitome\"--a smaller work\r\nissued before (?) the \"Fabrica,\" with rather larger plates, two of which\r\nrepresent nude human bodies and are not reproduced in the great work.\r\nThe freshest and most beautiful copy is the one on vellum which formerly\r\nbelonged to Dr. Mead, now in the British Museum, and from it this\r\npicture was taken. One of the most interesting features of the book are\r\nthe full-page illustrations of the anatomy of the arteries, veins\r\nand nerves. They had not in those days the art of making corrosion\r\npreparations, but they could in some way dissect to their finest\r\nramifications the arteries, veins and nerves, which were then spread on\r\nboards and dried. Several such preparations are now at the College of\r\nPhysicians in London, brought from Padua by Harvey. The plates of the\r\nmuscles are remarkably good, more correct, though not better perhaps, on\r\nthe whole, than some of Leonardo's.\r\n\r\n     (22) The next, in 1559, is recorded by Plater in his\r\n     autobiography, who gave a public dissection during three days in\r\n     the Church of St. Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nVesalius had no idea of a general circulation. Though he had escaped\r\nfrom the domination of the great Pergamenian in anatomy, he was still\r\nhis follower in physiology. The two figures annexed, taken from one\r\nof the two existing copies of the \"Tabulae Anatomica,\" are unique in\r\nanatomical illustration, and are of special value as illustrating the\r\nnotion of the vascular system that prevailed until Harvey's day. I\r\nhave already called your attention to Galen's view of the two separate\r\nsystems, one containing the coarse, venous blood for the general\r\nnutrition of the body, the other the arterial, full of a thinner, warmer\r\nblood with which were distributed the vital spirits and the vital\r\nheat. The veins had their origin in the liver; the superior vena cava\r\ncommunicated with the right heart, and, as Galen taught, some blood was\r\ndistributed to the lungs; but the two systems were closed, though Galen\r\nbelieved there was a communication at the periphery between the\r\narteries and veins. Vesalius accepted Galen's view that there is some\r\ncommunication between the venous and arterial systems through pores\r\nin the septum of the ventricles, though he had his doubts, and in the\r\nsecond edition of his book (1555) says that inspite of the authority\r\nof the Prince of Physicians he cannot see how the smallest quantity of\r\nblood could be transmitted through so dense a muscular septum. Two years\r\nbefore this (1553),(*) his old fellow student, Michael Servetus, had in\r\nhis \"Christianismi Restitutio\" annatomical touch with one another!\r\n\r\n     (*) See the Servetus Notes in the Osler Anniversary Volumes, New\r\n     York, 1919, Vol. II.--Ed.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the \"Fabrica\" shook the medical world to its\r\nfoundations. Galen ruled supreme in the schools: to doubt him in the\r\nleast particular roused the same kind of feeling as did doubts on the\r\nverbal inspiration of the Scriptures fifty years ago! His old teachers\r\nin Paris were up in arms: Sylvius, nostrae aetatis medicorum decus, as\r\nVesalius calls him, wrote furious letters, and later spoke of him as\r\na madman (vaesanus). The younger men were with him and he had many\r\nfriends, but he had aroused a roaring tide of detraction against which\r\nhe protested a few years later in his work on the \"China-root,\" which\r\nis full of details about the \"Fabrica.\" In a fit of temper he threw\r\nhis notes on Galen and other MSS. in the fire. No sadder page exists in\r\nmedical writings than the one in which Vesalius tells of the burning of\r\nhis books and MSS. It is here reproduced and translated.(23) His life\r\nfor a couple of years is not easy to follow, but we know that in 1546\r\nhe took service with Charles V as his body physician, and the greatest\r\nanatomist of his age was lost in the wanderings of court and campaigns.\r\nHe became an active practitioner, a distinguished surgeon, much\r\nconsulted by his colleagues, and there are references to many of his\r\ncases, the most important of which are to internal aneurysms, which he\r\nwas one of the first to recognize. In 1555 he brought out the second\r\nedition of the \"Fabrica,\" an even more sumptuous volume than the first.\r\n\r\n     (23) Epistle on China-root, 1546, p. 196.  Vesalius may be quoted\r\n     in explanation--in palliation:\r\n\r\n\"All these impediments I made light of; for I was too young to seek\r\ngain by my art, and I was sustained by my eager desire to learn and to\r\npromote the studies in which I shared. I say nothing of my diligence in\r\nanatomizing--those who attended my lectures in Italy know how I spent\r\nthree whole weeks over a single public dissection. But consider that in\r\none year I once taught in three different universities. If I had put\r\noff the task of writing till this time; if I were now just beginning\r\nto digest my materials; students would not have had the use of my\r\nanatomical labours, which posterity may or may not judge superior to\r\nthe rechauffes formerly in use, whether of Mesua, of Gatinaria, of some\r\nStephanus or other on the differences, causes and symptoms of diseases,\r\nor, lastly, of a part of Servitor's pharmacopoeia. As to my notes, which\r\nhad grown into a huge volume, they were all destroyed by me; and on the\r\nsame day there similarly perished the whole of my paraphrase on the ten\r\nbooks of Rhazes to King Almansor, which had been composed by me with far\r\nmore care than the one which is prefaced to the ninth book. With\r\nthese also went the books of some author or other on the formulae and\r\npreparation of medicines, to which I had added much matter of my own\r\nwhich I judged to be not without utility; and the same fate overtook all\r\nthe books of Galen which I had used in learning anatomy, and which I had\r\nliberally disfigured in the usual fashion. I was on the point of leaving\r\nItaly and going to Court; those physicians you know of had made to the\r\nEmperor and to the nobles a most unfavourable report of my books and of\r\nall that is published nowadays for the promotion of study; I therefore\r\nburnt all these works that I have mentioned, thinking at the same time\r\nthat it would be an easy matter to abstain from writing for the future.\r\nI must show that I have since repented more than once of my impatience,\r\nand regretted that I did not take the advice of the friends who were\r\nthen with me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no such pathetic tragedy in the history of our profession.\r\nBefore the age of thirty Vesalius had effected a revolution in anatomy;\r\nhe became the valued physician of the greatest court of Europe; but call\r\nno man happy till he is dead! A mystery surrounds his last days. The\r\nstory is that he had obtained permission to perform a post-mortem\r\nexamination on the body of a young Spanish nobleman, whom he had\r\nattended. When the body was opened, the spectators to their horror saw\r\nthe heart beating, and there were signs of life! Accused, so it is said,\r\nby the Inquisition of murder and also of general impiety he only escaped\r\nthrough the intervention of the King, with the condition that he make a\r\npilgrimage to the Holy Land. In carrying this out in 1564 he was wrecked\r\non the island of Zante, where he died of a fever or of exhaustion, in\r\nthe fiftieth year of his age.\r\n\r\nTo the North American Review, November, 1902, Edith Wharton contributed\r\na poem on \"Vesalius in Zante,\" in which she pictures his life, so\r\nfull of accomplishment, so full of regrets--regrets accentuated by the\r\nreceipt of an anatomical treatise by Fallopius, the successor to the\r\nchair in Padua! She makes him say:\r\n\r\n     There are two ways of spreading light; to be\r\n     The candle or the mirror that reflects it.\r\n     I let my wick burn out--there yet remains\r\n     To spread an answering surface to the flame\r\n     That others kindle.\r\n\r\nBut between Mundinus and Vesalius, anatomy had been studied by a group\r\nof men to whom I must, in passing, pay a tribute. The great artists\r\nRaphael, Michael Angelo and Albrecht Durer were keen students of the\r\nhuman form. There is an anatomical sketch by Michael Angelo in the\r\nAshmolean Museum, Oxford, which I here reproduce.(*) Durer's famous work\r\non \"Human Proportion,\" published in 1528, contains excellent figures,\r\nbut no sketches of dissections. But greater than any of these, and\r\nantedating them, is Leonardo da Vinci, the one universal genius in\r\nwhom the new spirit was incarnate--the Moses who alone among his\r\ncontemporaries saw the promised land. How far Leonardo was indebted to\r\nhis friend and fellow student, della Torre, at Pavia we do not know,\r\nnor does it matter in face of the indubitable fact that in the\r\nmany anatomical sketches from his hand we have the first accurate\r\nrepresentation of the structure of the body. Glance at the three figures\r\nof the spine which I have had photographed side by side, one from\r\nLeonardo, one from Vesalius and the other from Vandyke Carter, who did\r\nthe drawings in Gray's \"Anatomy\" (1st ed., 1856). They are all of the\r\nsame type, scientific, anatomical drawings, and that of Leonardo was\r\ndone fifty years before Vesalius! Compare, too, this figure of the\r\nbones of the foot with a similar one from Vesalius.(24) Insatiate\r\nin experiment, intellectually as greedy as Aristotle, painter, poet,\r\nsculptor, engineer, architect, mathematician, chemist, botanist,\r\naeronaut, musician and withal a dreamer and mystic, full accomplishment\r\nin any one department was not for him! A passionate desire for a mastery\r\nof nature's secrets made him a fierce thing, replete with too much\r\nrage! But for us a record remains--Leonardo was the first of modern\r\nanatomists, and fifty years later, into the breach he made, Vesalius\r\nentered.(25)\r\n\r\n     (*) This plate was lacking among the author's illustrations, but\r\n     the Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum remembers his repeatedly\r\n     showing special interest in the sketch reproduced in John\r\n     Addington Symonds's Life of Michelangelo, London, 1893, Vol. I,\r\n     p. 44, and in Charles Singer's Studies in the History and Method\r\n     of Science, Oxford, 1917, Vol. I, p. 97, representing Michael\r\n     Angelo and a friend dissecting the body of a man, by the light of\r\n     a candle fixed in the body itself.--Ed.\r\n\r\n     (24) He was the first to make and represent anatomical cross\r\n     sections. See Leonardo:  Quaderni d'Anatomia, Jacob Dybwad,\r\n     Kristiania, 1911-1916, Vol. V.\r\n\r\n     (25) See Knox:  Great Artists and Great Anatomists, London, 1862,\r\n     and Mathias Duval in Les Manuserits de Leonard de Vince: De\r\n     l'Anatomie, Feuillets A, Edouard Rouveyre, Paris, 1898. For a\r\n     good account of Leonardo da Vinci see Merejkovsky's novel, The\r\n     Forerunner, London, 1902, also New York, Putnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVEY\r\n\r\nLET us return to Padua about the year 1600. Vesalius, who made the\r\nschool the most famous anatomical centre in Europe, was succeeded by\r\nFallopius, one of the best-known names in anatomy, at whose death an\r\nunsuccessful attempt was made to get Vesalius back. He was succeeded in\r\n1565 by a remarkable man, Fabricius (who usually bears the added name\r\nof Aquapendente, from the town of his birth), a worthy follower of\r\nVesalius. In 1594, in the thirtieth year of his professoriate, he built\r\nat his own expense a new anatomical amphitheatre, which still exists\r\nin the university buildings. It is a small, high-pitched room with six\r\nstanding-rows for auditors rising abruptly one above the other. The\r\narena is not much more than large enough for the dissecting table which,\r\nby a lift, could be brought up from a preparing room below. The study of\r\nanatomy at Padua must have declined since the days of Vesalius if this\r\ntiny amphitheatre held all its students; none the less, it is probably\r\nthe oldest existing anatomical lecture room, and for us it has a very\r\nspecial significance.\r\n\r\nEarly in his anatomical studies Fabricius had demonstrated the valves in\r\nthe veins. I show you here two figures, the first, as far as I know, in\r\nwhich these structures are depicted. It does not concern us who first\r\ndiscovered them; they had doubtless been seen before, but Fabricius\r\nfirst recognized them as general structures in the venous system, and he\r\ncalled them little doors--\"ostiola.\"\r\n\r\nThe quadrangle of the university building at Padua is surrounded by\r\nbeautiful arcades, the walls and ceilings of which are everywhere\r\ncovered with the stemmata, or shields, of former students, many of them\r\nbrilliantly painted. Standing in the arcade on the side of the \"quad\"\r\nopposite the entrance, if one looks on the ceiling immediately above the\r\ncapital of the second column to the left there is seen the stemma which\r\nappears as tailpiece to this chapter, put up by a young Englishman,\r\nWilliam Harvey, who had been a student at Padua for four years. He\r\nbelonged to the \"Natio Anglica,\" of which he was Conciliarius, and\r\ntook his degree in 1602. Doubtless he had repeatedly seen Fabricius\r\ndemonstrate the valves of the veins, and he may indeed, as a senior\r\nstudent, have helped in making the very dissections from which the\r\ndrawings were taken for Fabricius' work, \"De Venarum Osteolis,\" 1603.\r\nIf one may judge from the character of the teacher's work the sort of\r\ninstruction the student receives, Harvey must have had splendid training\r\nin anatomy. While he was at Padua, the great work of Fabricius, \"De\r\nVisione, Voce et Auditu\" (1600) was published, then the \"Tractatus de\r\nOculo Visusque Organo\" (1601), and in the last year of his residence\r\nFabricius must have been busy with his studies on the valves of the\r\nveins and with his embryology, which appeared in 1604. Late in life,\r\nHarvey told Boyle that it was the position of the valves of the veins\r\nthat induced him to think of a circulation.\r\n\r\nHarvey returned to England trained by the best anatomist of his day. In\r\nLondon, he became attached to the College of Physicans, and taking his\r\ndegree at Cambridge, he began the practice of medicine. He was elected\r\na fellow of the college in 1607 and physician to St. Bartholomew's\r\nHospital in 1609. In 1615 he was appointed Lumleian lecturer to the\r\nCollege of Physicians, and his duties were to hold certain \"public\r\nanatomies,\" as they were called, or lectures. We know little or nothing\r\nof what Harvey had been doing other than his routine work in the care\r\nof the patients at St. Bartholomew's. It was not until April, 1616, that\r\nhis lectures began. Chance has preserved to us the notes of this first\r\ncourse; the MS. is now in the British Museum and was published in\r\nfacsimile by the college in 1886.(26)\r\n\r\n     (26) William Harvey:  Prelectiones Anatomiae Universalis, London,\r\n     J. & A. Churchill, 1886.\r\n\r\nThe second day lecture, April 17, was concerned with a description of\r\nthe organs of the thorax, and after a discussion on the structure and\r\naction of the heart come the lines:\r\n\r\n     W. H. constat per fabricam cordis sanguinem\r\n     per pulmones in Aortam perpetuo\r\n     transferri, as by two clacks of a\r\n     water bellows to rayse water\r\n     constat per ligaturam transitum sanguinis\r\n     ab arteriis ad venas\r\n     unde perpetuum sanguinis motum\r\n     in circulo fieri pulsu cordis.\r\n\r\nThe illustration will give one an idea of the extraordinarily crabbed\r\nhand in which the notes are written, but it is worth while to see the\r\noriginal, for here is the first occasion upon which is laid down in\r\nclear and unequivocal words that the blood CIRCULATES. The lecture gave\r\nevidence of a skilled anatomist, well versed in the literature from\r\nAristotle to Fabricius. In the MS. of the thorax, or, as he calls it,\r\nthe \"parlour\" lecture, there are about a hundred references to some\r\ntwenty authors. The remarkable thing is that although those lectures\r\nwere repeated year by year, we have no evidence that they made any\r\nimpression upon Harvey's contemporaries, so far, at least, as to excite\r\ndiscussions that led to publication. It was not until twelve years\r\nlater, 1628, that Harvey published in Frankfurt a small quarto volume\r\nof seventy-four pages,(27) \"De Motu Cordis.\" In comparison with the\r\nsumptuous \"Fabrica\" of Vesalius this is a trifling booklet; but if not\r\nits equal in bulk or typographical beauty (it is in fact very poorly\r\nprinted), it is its counterpart in physiology, and did for that science\r\nwhat Vesalius had done for anatomy, though not in the same way. The\r\nexperimental spirit was abroad in the land, and as a student at Padua,\r\nHarvey must have had many opportunities of learning the technique of\r\nvivisection; but no one before his day had attempted an elaborate piece\r\nof experimental work deliberately planned to solve a problem relating to\r\nthe most important single function of the body. Herein lies the special\r\nmerit of his work, from every page of which there breathes the modern\r\nspirit. To him, as to Vesalius before him, the current views of the\r\nmovements of the blood were unsatisfactory, more particularly the\r\nmovements of the heart and arteries, which were regarded as an active\r\nexpansion by which they were filled with blood, like bellows with air.\r\nThe question of the transmission of blood through the thick septum\r\nand the transference of air and blood from the lungs to the heart were\r\nsecrets which he was desirous of searching out by means of experiment.\r\n\r\n     (27) Harvey:  Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis\r\n     in Animalibus, Francofurti, 1628.\r\n\r\nOne or two special points in the work may be referred to as illustrating\r\nhis method. He undertook first the movements of the heart, a task so\r\ntruly arduous and so full of difficulties that he was almost tempted to\r\nthink with Fracastorius that \"the movement of the heart was only to be\r\ncomprehended by God.\" But after many difficulties he made the following\r\nstatements: first, that the heart is erected and raises itself up into\r\nan apex, and at this time strikes against the breast and the pulse is\r\nfelt externally; secondly, that it is contracted every-way, but more\r\nso at the sides; and thirdly, that grasped in the hand it was felt\r\nto become harder at the time of its motion; from all of which actions\r\nHarvey drew the very natural conclusion that the activity of the heart\r\nconsisted in a contraction of its fibres by which it expelled the blood\r\nfrom the ventricles. These were the first four fundamental facts which\r\nreally opened the way for the discovery of the circulation, as it did\r\naway with the belief that the heart in its motion attracts blood into\r\nthe ventricles, stating on the contrary that by its contraction it\r\nexpelled the blood and only received it during its period of repose or\r\nrelaxation. Then he proceeded to study the action of the arteries and\r\nshowed that their period of diastole, or expansion, corresponded with\r\nthe systole, or contraction, of the heart, and that the arterial pulse\r\nfollows the force, frequency and rhythm of the ventricle and is, in\r\nfact, dependent upon it. Here was another new fact: that the pulsation\r\nin the arteries was nothing else than the impulse of the blood within\r\nthem. Chapter IV, in which he describes the movements of the auricles\r\nand ventricles, is a model of accurate description, to which little has\r\nsince been added. It is interesting to note that he mentions what is\r\nprobably auricular fibrillation. He says: \"After the heart had ceased\r\npulsating an undulation or palpitation remained in the blood itself\r\nwhich was contained in the right auricle, this being observed so long as\r\nit was imbued with heat and spirit.\" He recognized too the importance of\r\nthe auricles as the first to move and the last to die. The accuracy and\r\nvividness of Harvey's description of the motion of the heart have been\r\nappreciated by generations of physiologists. Having grasped this first\r\nessential fact, that the heart was an organ for the propulsion of blood,\r\nhe takes up in Chapters VI and VII the question of the conveyance of the\r\nblood from the right side of the heart to the left. Galen had already\r\ninsisted that some blood passed from the right ventricle to the\r\nlungs--enough for their nutrition; but Harvey points out, with Colombo,\r\nthat from the arrangement of the valves there could be no other view\r\nthan that with each impulse of the heart blood passes from the right\r\nventricle to the lungs and so to the left side of the heart. How\r\nit passed through the lungs was a problem: probably by a continuous\r\ntransudation. In Chapters VIII and IX he deals with the amount of blood\r\npassing through the heart from the veins to the arteries. Let me quote\r\nhere what he says, as it is of cardinal import:\r\n\r\n\"But what remains to be said upon the quantity and source of the blood\r\nwhich thus passes, is of a character so novel and unheard of that I not\r\nonly fear injury to myself from the envy of a few, but I tremble lest\r\nI have mankind at large for my enemies, so much doth wont and custom\r\nbecome a second nature. Doctrine once sown strikes deeply its root, and\r\nrespect for antiquity influences all men. Still the die is cast, and my\r\ntrust is in my love of truth, and the candour of cultivated minds.\"(28)\r\nThen he goes on to say:\r\n\r\n     (28) William Harvey:  Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et\r\n     Sanguinis in Animalibus, Francofurti, 1628, G. Moreton's\r\n     facsimile reprint and translation, Canterbury, 1894, p. 48.\r\n\r\n\"I began to think whether there might not be A MOVEMENT, AS IT WERE, IN\r\nA CIRCLE. Now this I afterwards found to be true; and I finally saw that\r\nthe blood, forced by the action of the left ventricle into the arteries,\r\nwas distributed to the body at large, and its several parts, in the same\r\nmanner as it is sent through the lungs, impelled by the right ventricle\r\ninto the pulmonary artery, and that it then passed through the veins and\r\nalong the vena cava, and so round to the left ventricle in the manner\r\nalready indicated.\"(29)\r\n\r\n     (29) Ibid. p. 49.\r\n\r\nThe experiments dealing with the transmission of blood in the veins\r\nare very accurate, and he uses the old experiment that Fabricius had\r\nemployed to show the valves, to demonstrate that the blood in the veins\r\nflows towards the heart. For the first time a proper explanation of the\r\naction of the valves is given. Harvey had no appreciation of how\r\nthe arteries and veins communicated with each other. Galen, you may\r\nremember, recognized that there were anastomoses, but Harvey preferred\r\nthe idea of filtration.\r\n\r\nThe \"De Motu Cordis\" constitutes a unique piece of work in the history\r\nof medicine. Nothing of the same type had appeared before. It is\r\na thoroughly sensible, scientific study of a definite problem, the\r\nsolution of which was arrived at through the combination of accurate\r\nobservation and ingenious experiment. Much misunderstanding has arisen\r\nin connection with Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood.\r\nHe did not discover that the blood moved,--that was known to Aristotle\r\nand to Galen, from both of whom I have given quotations which indicate\r\nclearly that they knew of its movement,--but at the time of Harvey not a\r\nsingle anatomist had escaped from the domination of Galen's views.\r\nBoth Servetus and Colombo knew of the pulmonary circulation, which was\r\ndescribed by the former in very accurate terms. Cesalpinus, a great\r\nname in anatomy and botany, for whom is claimed the discovery of the\r\ncirculation, only expressed the accepted doctrines in the following\r\noft-quoted phrase:\r\n\r\n\"We will now consider how the attraction of aliment and the process\r\nof nutrition takes place in plants; for in animals we see the aliment\r\nbrought through the veins to the heart, as to a laboratory of innate\r\nheat, and, after receiving there its final perfection, distributed\r\nthrough the arteries to the body at large, by the agency of the spirits\r\nproduced from this same aliment in the heart.\"(30) There is nothing\r\nin this but Galen's view, and Cesalpinus believed, as did all his\r\ncontemporaries, that the blood was distributed through the body by the\r\nvena cava and its branches for the nourishment of all its parts.(*) To\r\nthose who have any doubts as to Harvey's position in this matter I would\r\nrecommend the reading of the \"De Motu Cordis\" itself, then the various\r\npassages relating to the circulation from Aristotle to Vesalius. Many\r\nof these can be found in the admirable works of Dalton, Flourens,\r\nRichet and Curtis.(31) In my Harveian Oration for 1906(32) I have dealt\r\nspecially with the reception of the new views, and have shown how long\r\nit was before the reverence for Galen allowed of their acceptance. The\r\nUniversity of Paris opposed the circulation of the blood for more than\r\nhalf a century after the appearance of the \"De Motu Cordis.\"\r\n\r\n     (30) De Plantis, Lib I, cap. 2.\r\n\r\n     (*) Cesalpinus has also a definite statement of the circlewise\r\n     process.--Ed.\r\n\r\n     (31) J. C.

Like\r\na bellows the lungs fanned and cooled this vital blood. Here and there\r\nwe find glimmering conceptions of a communication between these systems,\r\nbut practically all teachers believed that the only one of importance\r\nwas through small pores in the wall separating the two sides of the\r\nheart. Observation--merely looking at and thinking about things--had\r\ndone all that was possible, and further progress had to await the\r\nintroduction of a new method, viz., experiment. Galen, it is true, had\r\nused this means to show that the arteries of the body contained blood\r\nand not air. The day had come when men were no longer content with\r\naccurate description and with finely spun theories and dreams. It was\r\nreserved for the immortal Harvey to put into practice the experimental\r\nmethod by which he demonstrated conclusively that the blood moved in a\r\ncircle. The \"De Motu Cordis\" marks the final break of the modern spirit\r\nwith the old traditions. It took long for men to realize the value of\r\nthis \"inventum mirabile\" used so effectively by the Alexandrians--by\r\nGalen--indeed, its full value has only been appreciated within the past\r\ncentury. Let me quote a paragraph from my Harveian Oration.(33) \"To the\r\nage of the hearer, in which men had heard and heard only, had succeeded\r\nthe age of the eye in which men had seen and had been content only\r\nto see. But at last came the age of the hand--the thinking, devising,\r\nplanning hand, the hand as an instrument of the mind, now re-introduced\r\ninto the world in a modest little monograph from which we may date the\r\nbeginning of experimental medicine.\"\r\n\r\n     (33) Osler:  An Alabama Student, etc., pp. 329-330.\r\n\r\nHarvey caught the experimental spirit in Italy, with brain, eye and hand\r\nas his only aids, but now an era opened in which medicine was to derive\r\nan enormous impetus from the discovery of instruments of precision. \"The\r\nnew period in the development of the natural sciences, which reached\r\nits height in the work of such men as Galileo, Gilbert and Kepler, is\r\nchiefly characterized by the invention of very important instruments for\r\naiding and intensifying the perceptions of the senses, by means of which\r\nwas gained a much deeper insight into the phenomena than had hitherto\r\nbeen possible. Such instruments as the earlier ages possessed were\r\nlittle more than primitive hand-made tools. Now we find a considerable\r\nnumber of scientifically made instruments deliberately planned for\r\npurposes of special research, and as it were, on the threshold of the\r\nperiod stand two of the most important, the compound microscope and\r\nthe telescope. The former was invented about 1590 and the latter about\r\n1608.\"(34) It was a fellow professor of the great genius Galileo who\r\nattempted to put into practice the experimental science of his friend.\r\nWith Sanctorius began the studies of temperature, respiration and the\r\nphysics of the circulation. The memory of this great investigator has\r\nnot been helped by the English edition of his \"De Statica Medicina,\" not\r\nhis best work, with a frontispiece showing the author in his dietetic\r\nbalance. Full justice has been done to him by Dr. Weir Mitchell in\r\nan address as president of the Congress of Physicians and Surgeons,\r\n1891.(35) Sanctorius worked with a pulsilogue devised for him by\r\nGalileo, with which he made observations on the pulse. He is said\r\nto have been the first to put in use the clinical thermometer. His\r\nexperiments on insensible perspiration mark him as one of the first\r\nmodern physiologists.\r\n\r\n     (34) Dannemann:  Die Naturwissenschaften in ihrer\r\n     Entwickelung..., Vol. II, p. 7, Leipzig, 1911.\r\n\r\n     (35) See Transactions Congress Physicians and Surgeons, 1891, New\r\n     Haven, 1892, II, 159-181.\r\n\r\nBut neither Sanctorius nor Harvey had the immediate influence upon their\r\ncontemporaries which the novel and stimulating character of their work\r\njustified. Harvey's great contemporary, Bacon, although he lost his\r\nlife in making a cold storage experiment, did not really appreciate the\r\nenormous importance of experimental science. He looked very coldly upon\r\nHarvey's work. It was a philosopher of another kidney, Rene Descartes,\r\nwho did more than anyone else to help men to realize the value of the\r\nbetter way which Harvey had pointed out. That the beginning of wisdom\r\nwas in doubt, not in authority, was a novel doctrine in the world,\r\nbut Descartes was no armchair philosopher, and his strong advocacy and\r\npractice of experimentation had a profound influence in directing men to\r\n\"la nouvelle methode.\" He brought the human body, the earthly machine,\r\nas he calls it, into the sphere of mechanics and physics, and he wrote\r\nthe first text-book of physiology, \"De l'Homme.\" Locke, too, became the\r\nspokesman of the new questioning spirit, and before the close of the\r\nseventeenth century, experimental research became all the mode. Richard\r\nLower, Hooke and Hales were probably more influenced by Descartes\r\nthan by Harvey, and they made notable contributions to experimental\r\nphysiology in England. Borelli, author of the famous work on \"The Motion\r\nof Animals\" (Rome, 1680-1681), brought to the study of the action of\r\nmuscles a profound knowledge of physics and mathematics and really\r\nfounded the mechanical, or iatromechanical school. The literature and\r\nthe language of medicine became that of physics and mechanics: wheels\r\nand pulleys, wedges, levers, screws, cords, canals, cisterns, sieves and\r\nstrainers, with angles, cylinders, celerity, percussion and resistance,\r\nwere among the words that now came into use in medical literature.\r\nWithington quotes a good example in a description by Pitcairne, the Scot\r\nwho was professor of medicine at Leyden at the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. \"Life is the circulation of the blood. Health is its free and\r\npainless circulation. Disease is an abnormal motion of the blood, either\r\ngeneral or local. Like the English school generally, he is far more\r\nexclusively mechanical than are the Italians, and will hear nothing of\r\nferments or acids, even in digestion. This, he declares, is a purely\r\nmechanical process due to heat and pressure, the wonderful effects of\r\nwhich may be seen in Papin's recently invented 'digester.' That the\r\nstomach is fully able to comminute the food may be proved by the\r\nfollowing calculation. Borelli estimates the power of the flexors of the\r\nthumb at 3720 pounds, their average weight being 122 grains. Now, the\r\naverage weight of the stomach is eight ounces, therefore it can develop\r\na force of 117,088 pounds, and this may be further assisted by the\r\ndiaphragm and abdominal muscles the power of which, estimated in the\r\nsame way, equals 461,219 pounds! Well may Pitcairne add that this\r\nforce is not inferior to that of any millstone.\"(36) Paracelsus gave an\r\nextraordinary stimulus to the study of chemistry and more than anyone\r\nelse he put the old alchemy on modern lines. I have already quoted his\r\nsane remark that its chief service is in seeking remedies. But there is\r\nanother side to this question. If, as seems fairly certain, the Basil\r\nValentine whose writings were supposed to have inspired Paracelsus was\r\na hoax and his works were made up in great part from the writings\r\nof Paracelsus, then to our medical Luther, and not to the mythical\r\nBenedictine monk, must be attributed a great revival in the search\r\nfor the Philosopher's Stone, for the Elixir of Life, for a universal\r\nmedicine, for the perpetuum mobile and for an aurum potabile.(37) I\r\nreproduce, almost at random, a page from the fifth and last part of the\r\nlast will and testament of Basil Valentine (London, 1657), from which\r\nyou may judge the chemical spirit of the time.\r\n\r\n     (36) Withington:  Medical History from the Earliest Times,\r\n     London, 1891, Scientific Press, p. 317.\r\n\r\n     (37) See Professor Stillman on the Basil Valentine hoax, Popular\r\n     Science Monthly, New York, 1919, LXXXI, 591-600.\r\n\r\nOut of the mystic doctrines of Paracelsus arose the famous \"Brothers of\r\nthe Rosy Cross.\" \"The brotherhood was possessed of the deepest knowledge\r\nand science, the transmutation of metals, the perpetuum mobile and\r\nthe universal medicine were among their secrets; they were free from\r\nsickness and suffering during their lifetime, though subject finally to\r\ndeath.\"(38)\r\n\r\n     (38) Ferguson:  Bibliotheca Chemica, Vol. II, p. 290.  For an\r\n     account of Fludd and the English Rosicrucians see Craven's Life\r\n     of Fludd, Kirkwall, 1902.\r\n\r\nA school of a more rational kind followed directly upon the work of\r\nParacelsus, in which the first man of any importance was Van Helmont.\r\nThe Paracelsian Archeus was the presiding spirit in living creatures,\r\nand worked through special local ferments, by which the functions of the\r\norgans are controlled. Disease of any part represents a strike on the\r\npart of the local Archeus, who refuses to work. Though full of fanciful\r\nideas, Van Helmont had the experimental spirit and was the first chemist\r\nto discover the diversity of gases. Like his teacher, he was in revolt\r\nagainst the faculty, and he has bitter things to say of physicians. He\r\ngot into trouble with the Church about the magnetic cure of wounds, as\r\nno fewer than twenty-seven propositions incompatible with the Catholic\r\nfaith were found in his pamphlet (Ferguson). The Philosophus per ignem,\r\nToparcha in Merode, Royenborch, as he is styled in certain of his\r\nwritings, is not an easy man to tackle. I show the title-page of the\r\n\"Ortus Medicinae,\" the collection of his works by his son. As with the\r\npages of Paracelsus, there are many gems to be dug out. The counterblast\r\nagainst bleeding was a useful protest, and to deny in toto its utility\r\nin fever required courage--a quality never lacking in the Father of\r\nModern Chemistry, as he has been called.\r\n\r\nA man of a very different type, a learned academic, a professor\r\nof European renown, was Daniel Sennert of Wittenberg, the first to\r\nintroduce the systematic teaching of chemistry into the curriculum,\r\nand who tried to harmonize the Galenists and Paracelsians. Franciscus\r\nSylvius, a disciple of Van Helmont, established the first chemical\r\nlaboratory in Europe at Leyden, and to him is due the introduction of\r\nmodern clinical teaching. In 1664 he writes: \"I have led my pupils\r\nby the hand to medical practice, using a method unknown at Leyden, or\r\nperhaps elsewhere, i.e., taking them daily to visit the sick at the\r\npublic hospital. There I have put the symptoms of disease before their\r\neyes; have let them hear the complaints of the patients, and have asked\r\nthem their opinions as to the causes and rational treatment of each\r\ncase, and the reasons for those opinions. Then I have given my own\r\njudgment on every point. Together with me they have seen the happy\r\nresults of treatment when God has granted to our cares a restoration of\r\nhealth; or they have assisted in examining the body when the patient has\r\npaid the inevitable tribute to death.\"(39)\r\n\r\n     (39) Withington:  Medical History from the Earliest Times,\r\n     London, 1894, pp. 312-313.\r\n\r\nGlauber, Willis, Mayow, Lemery, Agricola and Stahl led up to Robert\r\nBoyle, with whom modern chemistry may be said to begin. Even as late as\r\n1716, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in Vienna found that all had transferred\r\ntheir superstitions from religion to chemistry; \"scarcely a man of\r\nopulence or fashion that has not an alchemist in his service.\" To one\r\nscientific man of the period I must refer as the author of the first\r\nscientific book published in England. Dryden sings:\r\n\r\n     Gilbert shall live till load-stones cease to draw\r\n     Or British fleets the boundless ocean awe.\r\n\r\nAnd the verse is true, for by the publication in 1600 of the \"De\r\nMagnete\" the science of electricity was founded. William Gilbert was a\r\nfine type of the sixteenth-century physician, a Colchester man, educated\r\nat St. John's College, Cambridge. Silvanus Thompson says: \"He is beyond\r\nquestion rightfully regarded as the Father of Electric Science. He\r\nfounded the entire subject of Terrestrial Magnetism. He also made\r\nnotable contributions to Astronomy, being the earliest English expounder\r\nof Copernicus. In an age given over to metaphysical obscurities and\r\ndogmatic sophistry, he cultivated the method of experiment and of\r\nreasoning from observation, with an insight and success which entitles\r\nhim to be regarded as the father of the inductive method. That method,\r\nso often accredited to Bacon, Gilbert was practicing years before\r\nhim.\"(40)\r\n\r\n     (40) Silvanus P. Thompson:  Gilbert of Colchester, Father of\r\n     Electrical Science, London, Chiswick Press, 1903, p. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V -- THE RISE AND DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN MEDICINE\r\n\r\nTHE middle of the seventeenth century saw the profession thus far on\r\nits way--certain objective features of disease were known, the art of\r\ncareful observation had been cultivated, many empirical remedies had\r\nbeen discovered, the coarser structure of man's body had been well\r\nworked out, and a good beginning had been made in the knowledge of how\r\nthe machinery worked--nothing more. What disease really was, where\r\nit was, how it was caused, had not even begun to be discussed\r\nintelligently.\r\n\r\nAn empirical discovery of the first importance marks the middle of the\r\ncentury. The story of cinchona is of special interest, as it was the\r\nfirst great specific in disease to be discovered. In 1638, the wife\r\nof the Viceroy of Peru, the Countess of Chinchon, lay sick of an\r\nintermittent fever in the Palace of Lima. A friend of her husband's,\r\nwho had become acquainted with the virtues, in fever, of the bark of\r\na certain tree, sent a parcel of it to the Viceroy, and the remedy\r\nadministered by her physician, Don Juan del Vego, rapidly effected\r\na cure. In 1640, the Countess returned to Spain, bringing with her\r\na supply of quina bark, which thus became known in Europe as \"the\r\nCountess's Powder\" (pulvis Comitissae). A little later, her doctor\r\nfollowed, bringing additional quantities. Later in the century,\r\nthe Jesuit Fathers sent parcels of the bark to Rome, whence it was\r\ndistributed to the priests of the community and used for the cure of\r\nague; hence the name of \"Jesuits' bark.\" Its value was early recognized\r\nby Sydenham and by Locke. At first there was a great deal of opposition,\r\nand the Protestants did not like it because of its introduction by the\r\nJesuits. The famous quack, Robert Talbor, sold the secret of preparing\r\nquinquina to Louis XIV in 1679 for two thousand louis d'or, a pension\r\nand a title. That the profession was divided in opinion on the subject\r\nwas probably due to sophistication, or to the importation of other and\r\ninert barks. It was well into the eighteenth century before its virtues\r\nwere universally acknowledged. The tree itself was not described until\r\n1738, and Linnaeus established the genus \"Chinchona\" in honor of the\r\nCountess.(1)\r\n\r\n     (1) Clements R. Markham:  Peruvian Bark, John Murray, London,\r\n     1880; Memoir of the Lady Anna di Osoria, Countess of Chinchona\r\n     and Vice-Queen of Peru, 1874.\r\n\r\nA step in advance followed the objective study of the changes wrought in\r\nthe body by disease. To a few of these the anatomists had already called\r\nattention. Vesalius, always keen in his description of aberrations from\r\nthe normal, was one of the first to describe internal aneurysm. The\r\ntruth is, even the best of men had little or no appreciation of the\r\nimportance of the study of these changes. Sydenham scoffs at the value\r\nof post-mortems.\r\n\r\nAgain we have to go back to Italy for the beginning of these studies,\r\nthis time to Florence, in the glorious days of Lorenzo the Magnificent.\r\nThe pioneer now is not a professor but a general practitioner, Antonio\r\nBenivieni, of whom we know very little save that he was a friend of\r\nMarsilio Ficino and of Angelo Poliziano, and that he practiced in\r\nFlorence during the last third of the fifteenth century, dying in 1502.\r\nThrough associations with the scholars of the day, he had become a\r\nstudent of Greek medicine and he was not only a shrewd and accurate\r\nobserver of nature but a bold and successful practitioner. He had formed\r\nthe good habit of making brief notes of his more important cases, and\r\nafter his death these were found by his brother Jerome and published in\r\n1507.(2) This book has a rare value as the record of the experience of\r\nan unusually intelligent practitioner of the period. There are in all\r\n111 observations, most of them commendably brief. The only one of any\r\nlength deals with the new \"Morbus Gallicus,\" of which, in the short\r\nperiod between its appearance and Benivieni's death, he had seen enough\r\nto leave a very accurate description; and it is interesting to note that\r\neven in those early days mercury was employed for its cure. The surgical\r\ncases are of exceptional interest, and No. 38 refers to a case of angina\r\nfor which he performed a successful operation. This is supposed to have\r\nbeen a tracheotomy, and if so, it is the first in the fourteen centuries\r\nthat had elapsed since the days of Antyllus.(3) There are other\r\nimportant cases which show that he was a dexterous and fearless surgeon.\r\nBut the special interest of the work for us is that, for the first time\r\nin modern literature, we have reports of post-mortem examinations made\r\nspecifically with a view to finding out the exact cause of death. Among\r\nthe 111 cases, there are post-mortem records of cases of gallstones,\r\nabscess of the mesentery, thrombosis of the mesenteric veins, several\r\ncases of heart disease, senile gangrene and one of cor villosum. From no\r\nother book do we get so good an idea of a practitioner's experience at\r\nthis period; the notes are plain and straightforward, and singularly\r\nfree from all theoretical and therapeutic vagaries. He gives several\r\nremarkable instances of faith healing.\r\n\r\n     (2) De abditis nonnullis ac mirandis morborum et sanationum\r\n     causis. 8th, Florence, Gandhi, 1507.\r\n\r\n     (3) Possibly it was only a case of angina Ludovici, or\r\n     retro-pharyngeal abscess.\r\n\r\nTo know accurately the anatomical changes that take place in disease is\r\nof importance both for diagnosis and for treatment. The man who created\r\nthe science, who taught us to think anatomically of disease,\r\nwas Morgagni, whose \"De sedibus et causis morborum per anatomen\r\nindagatis\"(4) is one of the great books in our literature. During the\r\nseventeenth century, the practice of making post-mortem examinations\r\nhad extended greatly, and in the \"Sepulchretum anatomicum\" of Bonetus\r\n(1679), these scattered fragments are collected.(5) But the work\r\nof Morgagni is of a different type, for in it are the clinical and\r\nanatomical observations of an able physician during a long and active\r\nlife. The work had an interesting origin. A young friend interested in\r\nscience and in medicine was fond of discoursing with Morgagni about his\r\npreceptors, particularly Valsalva and Albertini, and sometimes the young\r\nman inquired about Morgagni's own observations and thoughts. Yielding\r\nto a strong wish, Morgagni consented to write his young friend familiar\r\nletters describing his experiences. I am sorry that Morgagni does not\r\nmention the name of the man to whom we are so much indebted, and who,\r\nhe states, was so pleased with the letters that he continually solicited\r\nhim to send more and more \"till he drew me on so far as the seventieth;\r\n. . . when I begged them of him in order to revise their contents; he\r\ndid not return them, till he had made me solemnly promise, that I would\r\nnot abridge any part thereof\" (Preface).\r\n\r\n     (4) Venice, 1761.\r\n\r\n     (5) Boerhaave remarked that if a man wished to deserve or get a\r\n     medical degree from ONE medical author let it be this. (James\r\n     Atkinson: Medical Bibliography, 1834, 268.)\r\n\r\nBorn in 1682, Morgagni studied at Bologna under Valsalva and Albertini.\r\nIn 1711, he was elected professor of medicine at Padua. He published\r\nnumerous anatomical observations and several smaller works of less\r\nimportance. The great work which has made his name immortal in\r\nthe profession, appeared in his eightieth year, and represents the\r\naccumulated experience of a long life. Though written in the form\r\nof letters, the work is arranged systematically and has an index of\r\nexceptional value. From no section does one get a better idea of the\r\ncharacter and scope of the work than from that relating to the heart\r\nand arteries--affections of the pericardium, diseases of the valves,\r\nulceration, rupture, dilation and hypertrophy and affections of the\r\naorta are very fully described. The section on aneurysm of the\r\naorta remains one of the best ever written. It is not the anatomical\r\nobservations alone that make the work of unusual value, but the\r\ncombination of clinical with anatomical records. What could be more\r\ncorrect than this account of angina pectoris--probably the first in the\r\nliterature? \"A lady forty-two years of age, who for a long time, had\r\nbeen a valetudinarian, and within the same period, on using pretty quick\r\nexercise of body, she was subject to attacks of violent anguish in the\r\nupper part of the chest on the left side, accompanied with a difficulty\r\nof breathing, and numbness of the left arm; but these paroxysms soon\r\nsubsided when she ceased from exertion. In these circumstances, but with\r\ncheerfulness of mind, she undertook a journey from Venice, purposing\r\nto travel along the continent, when she was seized with a paroxysm, and\r\ndied on the spot. I examined the body on the following day.... The aorta\r\nwas considerably dilated at its curvature; and, in places, through\r\nits whole tract, the inner surface was unequal and ossified. These\r\nappearances were propagated into the arteria innominata. The aortic\r\nvalves were indurated....\" He remarks, \"The delay of blood in the aorta,\r\nin the heart, in the pulmonary vessels, and in the vena cave, would\r\noccasion the symptoms of which the woman complained during life; namely,\r\nthe violent uneasiness, the difficulty of breathing, and the numbness of\r\nthe arm.\"(6)\r\n\r\n     (6) Cooke's Morgagni, Vol. 1, pp. 417-418. I cannot too warmly\r\n     commend to young clinicians the reading of Morgagni.  English\r\n     editions are available--Alexander's three-volume translation of\r\n     1769 and Cooke's Abridgement (London, 1822), of which there was\r\n     an American edition published in Boston in 1824.\r\n\r\nMorgagni's life had as much influence as his work. In close\r\ncorrespondence with the leading men of the day, with the young and\r\nrising teachers and workers, his methods must have been a great\r\ninspiration; and he came just at the right time. The profession was\r\nliterally ravaged by theories, schools and systems--iatromechanics,\r\niatrochemistry, humoralism, the animism of Stahl, the vitalistic\r\ndoctrines of Van Helmont and his followers--and into this metaphysical\r\nconfusion Morgagni came like an old Greek with his clear observation,\r\nsensible thinking and ripe scholarship. Sprengel well remarks that \"it\r\nis hard to say whether one should admire most his rare dexterity and\r\nquickness in dissection, his unimpeachable love of truth and justice in\r\nhis estimation of the work of others, his extensive scholarship and rich\r\nclassical style or his downright common sense and manly speech.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this solid foundation the morbid anatomy of modern clinical\r\nmedicine was built. Many of Morgagni's contemporaries did not fully\r\nappreciate the change that was in progress, and the value of the new\r\nmethod of correlating the clinical symptoms and the morbid appearances.\r\nAfter all, it was only the extension of the Hippocratic method\r\nof careful observation--the study of facts from which reasonable\r\nconclusions could be drawn. In every generation there had been men of\r\nthis type--I dare say many more than we realize--men of the Benivieni\r\ncharacter, thoroughly practical, clear-headed physicians. A model of\r\nthis sort arose in England in the middle of the seventeenth century,\r\nThomas Sydenham (1624-1689), who took men back to Hippocrates, just as\r\nHarvey had led them back to Galen. Sydenham broke with authority\r\nand went to nature. It is extraordinary how he could have been so\r\nemancipated from dogmas and theories of all sorts. He laid down the\r\nfundamental proposition, and acted upon it, that \"all disease could be\r\ndescribed as natural history.\" To do him justice we must remember,\r\nas Dr. John Brown says, \"in the midst of what a mass of errors and\r\nprejudices, of theories actively mischievous, he was placed, at a time\r\nwhen the mania of hypothesis was at its height, and when the practical\r\npart of his art was overrun and stultified by vile and silly nostrums\"\r\n(\"Horae Subsecivae,\" Vol. I, 4th ed., Edinburgh, 1882, p. 40).\r\n\r\nListen to what he says upon the method of the study of medicine: \"In\r\nwriting therefore, such a natural history of diseases, every merely\r\nphilosophical hypothesis should be set aside, and the manifest and\r\nnatural phenomena, however minute, should be noted with the utmost\r\nexactness. The usefulness of this procedure cannot be easily overrated,\r\nas compared with the subtle inquiries and trifling notions of modern\r\nwriters, for can there be a shorter, or indeed any other way of coming\r\nat the morbific causes, or discovering the curative indications than by\r\na certain perception of the peculiar symptoms? By these steps and helps\r\nit was that the father of physic, the great Hippocrates, came to excel,\r\nhis theory being no more than an exact description or view of nature. He\r\nfound that nature alone often terminates diseases, and works a cure with\r\na few simple medicines, and often enough with no medicines at all.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the century many great clinical teachers arose, of\r\nwhom perhaps the most famous was Boerhaave, often spoken of as the Dutch\r\nHippocrates, who inspired a group of distinguished students. I have\r\nalready referred to the fact that Franciscus Sylvius at Leyden was the\r\nfirst among the moderns to organize systematic clinical teaching. Under\r\nBoerhaave, this was so developed that to this Dutch university students\r\nflocked from all parts of Europe. After teaching botany and chemistry,\r\nBoerhaave succeeded to the chair of physic in 1714. With an unusually\r\nwide general training, a profound knowledge of the chemistry of the\r\nday and an accurate acquaintance with all aspects of the history of\r\nthe profession, he had a strongly objective attitude of mind towards\r\ndisease, following closely the methods of Hippocrates and Sydenham. He\r\nadopted no special system, but studied disease as one of the phenomena\r\nof nature. His clinical lectures, held bi-weekly, became exceedingly\r\npopular and were made attractive not less by the accuracy and care with\r\nwhich the cases were studied than by the freedom from fanciful doctrines\r\nand the frank honesty of the man. He was much greater than his published\r\nwork would indicate, and, as is the case with many teachers of the first\r\nrank, his greatest contributions were his pupils. No other teacher of\r\nmodern times has had such a following. Among his favorite pupils may\r\nbe mentioned Haller, the physiologist, and van Swieten and de Haen, the\r\nfounders of the Vienna school.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, too, there were men who caught the new spirit, and appreciated\r\nthe value of combining morbid anatomy with clinical medicine. Lancisi,\r\none of the early students of disease of the heart, left an excellent\r\nmonograph on the subject, and was the first to call special attention\r\nto the association of syphilis with cardio-vascular disease. A younger\r\ncontemporary of his at Rome, Baglivi, was unceasing in his call to\r\nthe profession to return to Hippocratic methods, to stop reading\r\nphilosophical theories and to give up what he calls the \"fatal itch\" to\r\nmake systems.\r\n\r\nThe Leyden methods of instruction were carried far and wide throughout\r\nEurope; into Edinburgh by John Rutherford, who began to teach at the\r\nRoyal Infirmary in 1747, and was followed by Whytt and by Cullen; into\r\nEngland by William Saunders of Guy's Hospital. Unfortunately the\r\ngreat majority of clinicians could not get away from the theoretical\r\nconceptions of disease, and Cullen's theory of spasm and atony exercised\r\na profound influence on practice, particularly in this country, where it\r\nhad the warm advocacy of Benjamin Rush. Even more widespread became the\r\ntheories of a pupil of Cullen's, John Brown, who regarded excitability\r\nas the fundamental property of all living creatures: too much of this\r\nexcitability produced what were known as sthenic maladies, too little,\r\nasthenic; on which principles practice was plain enough. Few systems of\r\nmedicine have ever stirred such bitter controversy, particularly on the\r\nContinent, and in Charles Creighton's account of Brown(7) we read\r\nthat as late as 1802 the University of Gottingen was so convulsed by\r\ncontroversies as to the merits of the Brunonian system that contending\r\nfactions of students in enormous numbers, not unaided by the professors,\r\nmet in combat in the streets on two consecutive days and had to be\r\ndispersed by a troop of Hanoverian horse.\r\n\r\n     (7) Dictionary of National Biography, London, 1886, VII, 14-17.\r\n\r\nBut the man who combined the qualities of Vesalius, Harvey and Morgagni\r\nin an extraordinary personality was John Hunter. He was, in the first\r\nplace, a naturalist to whom pathological processes were only a small\r\npart of a stupendous whole, governed by law, which, however, could\r\nnever be understood until the facts had been accumulated, tabulated and\r\nsystematized. By his example, by his prodigious industry, and by his\r\nsuggestive experiments he led men again into the old paths of Aristotle,\r\nGalen and Harvey. He made all thinking physicians naturalists, and he\r\nlent a dignity to the study of organic life, and re-established a close\r\nunion between medicine and the natural sciences. Both in Britain and\r\nGreater Britain, he laid the foundation of the great collections and\r\nmuseums, particularly those connected with the medical schools. The\r\nWistar-Horner and the Warren Museums in this country originated with men\r\ngreatly influenced by Hunter. He was, moreover, the intellectual father\r\nof that interesting group of men on this side of the Atlantic who, while\r\npractising as physicians, devoted much time and labor to the study of\r\nnatural history; such men as Benjamin Smith Barton, David Hossack, Jacob\r\nBigelow, Richard Harlan, John D. Godman, Samuel George Morton, John\r\nCollins Warren, Samuel L. Mitchill and J. Ailken Meigs. He gave an\r\nimmense impetus in Great Britain to the study of morbid anatomy, and\r\nhis nephew, Matthew Baillie, published the first important book on the\r\nsubject in the English language.\r\n\r\nBefore the eighteenth century closed practical medicine had made great\r\nadvance. Smallpox, though not one of the great scourges like plague\r\nor cholera, was a prevalent and much dreaded disease, and in civilized\r\ncountries few reached adult life without an attack. Edward Jenner, a\r\npractitioner in Gloucestershire, and the pupil to whom John Hunter gave\r\nthe famous advice: \"Don't think, try!\" had noticed that milkmaids\r\nwho had been infected with cowpox from the udder of the cow were\r\ninsusceptible to smallpox. I show you here the hand of Sarah Nelmes with\r\ncowpox, 1796. A vague notion had prevailed among the dairies from time\r\nimmemorial that this disease was a preventive of the smallpox. Jenner\r\nput the matter to the test of experiment. Let me quote here his own\r\nwords: \"The first experiment was made upon a lad of the name of Phipps,\r\nin whose arm a little vaccine virus was inserted, taken from the hand\r\nof a young woman who had been accidentally infected by a cow.\r\nNotwithstanding the resemblance which the pustule, thus excited on\r\nthe boy's arm, bore to variolous inoculation, yet as the indisposition\r\nattending it was barely perceptible, I could scarcely persuade myself\r\nthe patient was secure from the Small Pox. However, on his being\r\ninoculated some months afterwards, it proved that he was secure.\"(8)\r\nThe results of his experiments were published in a famous small quarto\r\nvolume in 1798.(*) From this date, smallpox has been under control.\r\nThanks to Jenner, not a single person in this audience is pockmarked!\r\nA hundred and twenty-five years ago, the faces of more than half of you\r\nwould have been scarred. We now know the principle upon which protection\r\nis secured: an active acquired immunity follows upon an attack of a\r\ndisease of a similar nature. Smallpox and cowpox are closely allied and\r\nthe substances formed in the blood by the one are resistant to the\r\nvirus of the other. I do not see how any reasonable person can oppose\r\nvaccination or decry its benefits. I show you the mortality figures(9)\r\nof the Prussian Army and of the German Empire. A comparison with\r\nthe statistics of the armies of other European countries in which\r\nrevaccination is not so thoroughly carried out is most convincing of its\r\nefficacy.\r\n\r\n     (8) Edward Jenner:  The Origin of the Vaccine Inoculation,\r\n     London, 1801.\r\n\r\n     (*) Reprinted by Camac:  Epoch-making Contributions to Medicine,\r\n     etc., 1909.--Ed.\r\n\r\n     (9) Jockmann:  Pocken und Vaccinationlehre, 1913.\r\n\r\nThe early years of the century saw the rise of modern clinical medicine\r\nin Paris. In the art of observation men had come to a standstill.\r\nI doubt very much whether Corvisart in 1800 was any more skilful in\r\nrecognizing a case of pneumonia than was Aretaeus in the second century\r\nA. D. But disease had come to be more systematically studied; special\r\nclinics were organized, and teaching became much more thorough. Anyone\r\nwho wishes to have a picture of the medical schools in Europe in the\r\nfirst few years of the century, should read the account of the travels\r\nof Joseph Frank of Vienna.(10) The description of Corvisart is of a\r\npioneer in clinical teaching whose method remains in vogue today\r\nin France--the ward visit, followed by a systematic lecture in the\r\namphitheatre. There were still lectures on Hippocrates three times a\r\nweek, and bleeding was the principal plan of treatment: one morning\r\nFrank saw thirty patients, out of one hundred and twelve, bled!\r\nCorvisart was the strong clinician of his generation, and his accurate\r\nstudies on the heart were among the first that had concentrated\r\nattention upon a special organ. To him, too, is due the reintroduction\r\nof the art of percussion in internal disease discovered by Auenbrugger\r\nin 1761.\r\n\r\n     (10) Joseph Frank:  Reise nach Paris (etc.), Wien, 1804-05.\r\n\r\nThe man who gave the greatest impetus to the study of scientific\r\nmedicine at this time was Bichat, who pointed out that the pathological\r\nchanges in disease were not so much in organs as in tissues. His\r\nstudies laid the foundation of modern histology. He separated the\r\nchief constituent elements of the body into various tissues possessing\r\ndefinite physical and vital qualities. \"Sensibility and contractability\r\nare the fundamental qualities of living matter and of the life of our\r\ntissues. Thus Bichat substituted for vital forces 'vital properties,'\r\nthat is to say, a series of vital forces inherent in the different\r\ntissues.\"(11) His \"Anatomic Generale,\" published in 1802, gave an\r\nextraordinary stimulus to the study of the finer processes of disease,\r\nand his famous \"Recherches sur la Vie et sur la Mort\" (1800) dealt\r\na death-blow to old iatromechanical and iatrochemical views. His\r\ncelebrated definition may be quoted: \"La vie est l'ensemble des\r\nproprietes vitales qui resistent aux proprietes physiques, ou bien la\r\nvie est l'ensemble des fonctions qui resistent a la mort.\" (Life is the\r\nsum of the vital properties that withstand the physical properties,\r\nor, life is the sum of the functions that withstand death.) Bichat is\r\nanother pathetic figure in medical history. His meteoric career ended\r\nin his thirty-first year: he died a victim of a post-mortem wound\r\ninfection. At his death, Corvisart wrote Napoleon: \"Bichat has just died\r\nat the age of thirty. That battlefield on which he fell is one which\r\ndemands courage and claims many victims. He has advanced the science of\r\nmedicine. No one at his age has done so much so well.\"\r\n\r\n     (11) E. Boinet:  Les doctrines medicules, leur evolution, Paris,\r\n     1907, pp. 85-86.\r\n\r\nIt was a pupil of Corvisart, Rene Theophile Laennec, who laid the\r\nfoundation of modern clinical medicine. The story of his life is well\r\nknown. A Breton by birth, he had a hard, up-hill struggle as a young\r\nman--a struggle of which we have only recently been made aware by the\r\npublication of a charming book by Professor Rouxeau of Nantes--\"Laennec\r\navant 1806.\" Influenced by Corvisart, he began to combine the accurate\r\nstudy of cases in the wards with anatomical investigations in the\r\ndead-house. Before Laennec, the examination of a patient had been\r\nlargely by sense of sight, supplemented by that of touch, as in\r\nestimating the degree of fever, or the character of the pulse.\r\nAuenbrugger's \"Inventum novum\" of percussion, recognized by Corvisart,\r\nextended the field; but the discovery of auscultation by Laennec, and\r\nthe publication of his work--\"De l'Auscultation Mediate,\" 1819,--marked\r\nan era in the study of medicine. The clinical recognition of individual\r\ndiseases had made really very little progress; with the stethoscope\r\nbegins the day of physical diagnosis. The clinical pathology of the\r\nheart, lungs and abdomen was revolutionized. Laennec's book is in the\r\ncategory of the eight or ten greatest contributions to the science\r\nof medicine.(*) His description of tuberculosis is perhaps the most\r\nmasterly chapter in clinical medicine. This revolution was effected by\r\na simple extension of the Hippocratic method from the bed to the\r\ndead-house, and by correlating the signs and symptoms of a disease with\r\nits anatomical appearances.\r\n\r\n     (*) John Forbes's translation of Auenbrugger and part of his\r\n     translation of Lacnnec are reprinted in Camac's Epoch-making\r\n     Contributions, etc., 1909.--Ed.\r\n\r\nThe pupils and successors of Corvisart--Bayle, Andral, Bouillaud,\r\nChomel, Piorry, Bretonneau, Rayer, Cruveilhier and Trousseau--brought a\r\nnew spirit into the profession. Everywhere the investigation of disease\r\nby clinical-pathological methods widened enormously the diagnostic\r\npowers of the physician. By this method Richard Bright, in 1836, opened\r\na new chapter on the relation of disease of the kidney to dropsy, and to\r\nalbuminous urine. It had already been shown by Blackwell and by Wells,\r\nthe celebrated Charleston (S.C.) physician, in 1811, that the urine\r\ncontained albumin in many cases of dropsy, but it was not until\r\nBright began a careful investigation of the bodies of patients who had\r\npresented these symptoms, that he discovered the association of various\r\nforms of disease of the kidney with anasarca and albuminous urine. In no\r\ndirection was the harvest of this combined study more abundant than in\r\nthe complicated and confused subject of fever. The work of Louis and of\r\nhis pupils, W.W. Gerhard and others, revealed the distinction between\r\ntyphus and typhoid fever, and so cleared up one of the most obscure\r\nproblems in pathology. By Morgagni's method of \"anatomical thinking,\"\r\nSkoda in Vienna, Schonlein in Berlin, Graves and Stokes in Dublin,\r\nMarshall Hall, C. J. B. Williams and many others introduced the new and\r\nexact methods of the French and created a new clinical medicine. A\r\nvery strong impetus was given by the researches of Virchow on cellular\r\npathology, which removed the seats of disease from the tissues,\r\nas taught by Bichat, to the individual elements, the cells. The\r\nintroduction of the use of the microscope in clinical work widened\r\ngreatly our powers of diagnosis, and we obtained thereby a very much\r\nclearer conception of the actual processes of disease. In another way,\r\ntoo, medicine was greatly helped by the rise of experimental pathology,\r\nwhich had been introduced by John Hunter, was carried along by Magendie\r\nand others, and reached its culmination in the epoch-making researches\r\nof Claude Bernard. Not only were valuable studies made on the action of\r\ndrugs, but also our knowledge of cardiac pathology was revolutionized\r\nby the work of Traube, Cohnheim and others. In no direction did the\r\nexperimental method effect such a revolution as in our knowledge of the\r\nfunctions of the brain. Clinical neurology, which had received a great\r\nimpetus by the studies of Todd, Romberg, Lockhart Clarke, Duchenne and\r\nWeir Mitchell, was completely revolutionized by the experimental work\r\nof Hitzig, Fritsch and Ferrier on the localization of functions in\r\nthe brain. Under Charcot, the school of French neurologists gave great\r\naccuracy to the diagnosis of obscure affections of the brain and spinal\r\ncord, and the combined results of the new anatomical, physiological and\r\nexperimental work have rendered clear and definite what was formerly the\r\nmost obscure and complicated section of internal medicine. The end of\r\nthe fifth decade of the century is marked by a discovery of supreme\r\nimportance. Humphry Davy had noted the effects of nitrous oxide. The\r\nexhilarating influence of sulphuric ether had been casually studied, and\r\nLong of Georgia had made patients inhale the vapor until anaesthetic and\r\nhad performed operations upon them when in this state; but it was not\r\nuntil October 16, 1846, in the Massachusetts General Hospital, that\r\nMorton, in a public operating room, rendered a patient insensible with\r\nether and demonstrated the utility of surgical anaesthesia. The rival\r\nclaims of priority no longer interest us, but the occasion is one of\r\nthe most memorable in the history of the race. It is well that our\r\ncolleagues celebrate Ether Day in Boston--no more precious boon has ever\r\nbeen granted to suffering humanity.(*)\r\n\r\n     (*) Cf. Osler:  Proc. Roy. Soc. Med., XI, Sect.

Cf. also\r\n     Morton's publications reprinted in Camac's book cited above.--Ed.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, a young man, Louis Pasteur, sent to the Lille Scientific\r\nSociety a paper on \"Lactic Acid Fermentation\" and in December of the\r\nsame year presented to the Academy of Sciences in Paris a paper on\r\n\"Alcoholic Fermentation\" in which he concluded that \"the deduplication\r\nof sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid is correlative to a phenomenon\r\nof life.\" A new era in medicine dates from those two publications. The\r\nstory of Pasteur's life should be read by every student.(*) It is one of\r\nthe glories of human literature, and, as a record of achievement and of\r\nnobility of character, is almost without an equal.\r\n\r\n     (*) Osler wrote a preface for the 1911 English edition of the\r\n     Life by Vallery-Radot.--Ed.\r\n\r\nAt the middle of the last century we did not know much more of the\r\nactual causes of the great scourges of the race, the plagues, the fevers\r\nand the pestilences, than did the Greeks. Here comes Pasteur's great\r\nwork. Before him Egyptian darkness; with his advent a light that\r\nbrightens more and more as the years give us ever fuller knowledge. The\r\nfacts that fevers were catching, that epidemics spread, that infection\r\ncould remain attached to articles of clothing, etc., all gave support to\r\nthe view that the actual cause was something alive, a contagium vivum.\r\nIt was really a very old view, the germs of which may be found in the\r\nFathers, but which was first clearly expressed--so far as I know--by\r\nFracastorius, the Veronese physician, in the sixteenth century, who\r\nspoke of the seeds of contagion passing from one person to another;(12)\r\nand he first drew a parallel between the processes of contagion and\r\nthe fermentation of wine. This was more than one hundred years before\r\nKircher, Leeuwenhoek and others began to use the microscope and to see\r\nanimalcula, etc., in water, and so give a basis for the \"infinitely\r\nlittle\" view of the nature of disease germs. And it was a study of the\r\nprocesses of fermentation that led Pasteur to the sure ground on which\r\nwe now stand.\r\n\r\n     (12) Varro, in De Re Rustica, Bk. I, 12 (circa 40 B.C.), speaks\r\n     of minute organisms which the eye cannot see and which enter the\r\n     body and cause disease.\r\n\r\nOut of these researches arose a famous battle which kept Pasteur hard at\r\nwork for four or five years--the struggle over spontaneous generation.\r\nIt was an old warfare, but the microscope had revealed a new world, and\r\nthe experiments on fermentation had lent great weight to the omne vivum\r\nex ovo doctrine. The famous Italians, Redi and Spallanzani, had led the\r\nway in their experiments, and the latter had reached the conclusion\r\nthat there is no vegetable and no animal that has not its own germ. But\r\nheterogenesis became the burning question, and Pouchet in France, and\r\nBastian in England, led the opposition to Pasteur. The many famous\r\nexperiments carried conviction to the minds of scientific men, and\r\ndestroyed forever the old belief in spontaneous generation. All along,\r\nthe analogy between disease and fermentation must have been in Pasteur's\r\nmind; and then came the suggestion, \"What would be most desirable is to\r\npush those studies far enough to prepare the road for a serious\r\nresearch into the origin of various diseases.\" If the changes in lactic,\r\nalcoholic and butyric fermentations are due to minute living organisms,\r\nwhy should not the same tiny creatures make the changes which occur\r\nin the body in the putrid and suppurative diseases? With an accurate\r\ntraining as a chemist, having been diverted in his studies upon\r\nfermentation into the realm of biology, and nourishing a strong\r\nconviction of the identity between putrefactive changes of the body\r\nand fermentation, Pasteur was well prepared to undertake investigations\r\nwhich had hitherto been confined to physicians alone.\r\n\r\nSo impressed was he with the analogy between fermentation and the\r\ninfectious diseases that, in 1863, he assured the French Emperor of\r\nhis ambition \"to arrive at the knowledge of the causes of putrid and\r\ncontagious diseases.\" After a study upon the diseases of wines, which\r\nhas had most important practical bearings, an opportunity arose which\r\nchanged the whole course of his career, and profoundly influenced the\r\ndevelopment of medical science. A disease of the silkworm had, for some\r\nyears, ruined one of the most important industries in France, and in\r\n1865 the Government asked Pasteur to give up his laboratory work and\r\nteaching, and to devote his whole energies to the task of investigating\r\nit. The story of the brilliant success which followed years of\r\napplication to the problem will be read with deep interest by every\r\nstudent of science. It was the first of his victories in the application\r\nof the experimental methods of a trained chemist to the problems\r\nof biology, and it placed his name high in the group of the most\r\nillustrious benefactors of practical industries.\r\n\r\nIn a series of studies on the diseases of beer, and on the mode of\r\nproduction of vinegar, he became more and more convinced that these\r\nstudies on fermentation had given him the key to the nature of the\r\ninfectious diseases. It is a remarkable fact that the distinguished\r\nEnglish philosopher of the seventeenth century, the man who more\r\nthan anyone else of his century appreciated the importance of the\r\nexperimental method, Robert Boyle, had said that he who could discover\r\nthe nature of ferments and fermentation, would be more capable than\r\nanyone else of explaining the nature of certain diseases.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 there appeared in Cohn's \"Beitrage zur Morphologie der Pflanzen\"\r\n(II, 277-310), a paper on the \"AEtiology of Anthrax\" by a German\r\ndistrict physician in Wollstein, Robert Koch, which is memorable in our\r\nliterature as the starting point of a new method of research into\r\nthe causation of infectious diseases. Koch demonstrated the constant\r\npresence of germs in the blood of animals dying from the disease. Years\r\nbefore, those organisms had been seen by Pollender and Davaine, but\r\nthe epoch-making advance of Koch was to grow those organisms in a pure\r\nculture outside the body, and to produce the disease artificially\r\nby inoculating animals with the cultures Koch is really our medical\r\nGalileo, who, by means of a new technique,--pure cultures and isolated\r\nstaining,--introduced us to a new world. In 1878, followed his study on\r\nthe \"AEtiology of Wound Infections,\" in which he was able to demonstrate\r\nconclusively the association of micro-organisms with the disease. Upon\r\nthose two memorable researches made by a country doctor rests the modern\r\nscience of bacteriology.\r\n\r\nThe next great advance was the discovery by Pasteur of the possibility\r\nof so attenuating, or weakening, the poison that an animal inoculated\r\nhad a slight attack, recovered and was then protected against the\r\ndisease. More than eighty years had passed since on May 14, 1796, Jenner\r\nhad vaccinated a child with cowpox and proved that a slight attack of\r\none disease protected the body from a disease of an allied nature. An\r\noccasion equally famous in the history of medicine was a day in 1881,\r\nwhen Pasteur determined that a flock of sheep vaccinated with the\r\nattenuated virus of anthrax remained well, when every one of the\r\nunvaccinated infected from the same material had died. Meanwhile, from\r\nPasteur's researches on fermentation and spontaneous generation, a\r\ntransformation had been initiated in the practice of surgery, which,\r\nit is not too much to say, has proved one of the greatest boons ever\r\nconferred upon humanity. It had long been recognized that, now and\r\nagain, a wound healed without the formation of pus, that is, without\r\nsuppuration, but both spontaneous and operative wounds were almost\r\ninvariably associated with that process; and, moreover, they frequently\r\nbecame putrid, as it was then called,--infected, as we should say,--the\r\ngeneral system became involved and the patient died of blood poisoning.\r\nSo common was this, particularly in old, ill-equipped hospitals, that\r\nmany surgeons feared to operate, and the general mortality in all\r\nsurgical cases was very high. Believing that it was from outside that\r\nthe germs came which caused the decomposition of wounds, just as\r\nfrom the atmosphere the sugar solution got the germs which caused the\r\nfermentation, a young surgeon in Glasgow, Joseph Lister, applied the\r\nprinciples of Pasteur's experiments to their treatment. From Lister's\r\noriginal paper(*) I quote the following: \"Turning now to the question\r\nhow the atmosphere produces decomposition of organic substances, we find\r\nthat a flood of light has been thrown upon this most important subject\r\nby the philosophic researches of M. Pasteur, who has demonstrated by\r\nthoroughly convincing evidence that it is not to its oxygen or to any of\r\nits gaseous constituents that the air owes this property, but to minute\r\nparticles suspended in it, which are the germs of various low forms\r\nof life, long since revealed by the microscope, and regarded as merely\r\naccidental concomitants of putrescence, but now shown by Pasteur to\r\nbe its essential cause, resolving the complex organic compounds into\r\nsubstances of simpler chemical constitution, just as the yeast-plant\r\nconverts sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid.\" From these beginnings\r\nmodern surgery took its rise, and the whole subject of wound infection,\r\nnot only in relation to surgical diseases, but to child-bed fever, forms\r\nnow one of the most brilliant chapters in the history of preventive\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n     (*) Lancet, March 16, 1867.  (Cf. Camac:  Epoch-making\r\n     Contributions, etc., 1909, p. 7.--Ed.)\r\n\r\nWith the new technique and experimental methods, the discovery of the\r\nspecific germs of many of the more important acute infections followed\r\neach other with bewildering rapidity: typhoid fever, diphtheria,\r\ncholera, tetanus, plague, pneumonia, gonorrhoea and, most important of\r\nall, tuberculosis. It is not too much to say that the demonstration\r\nby Koch of the \"bacillus tuberculosis\" (1882) is, in its far-reaching\r\nresults, one of the most momentous discoveries ever made.\r\n\r\nOf almost equal value have been the researches upon the protozoan forms\r\nof animal life, as causes of disease. As early as 1873, spirilla were\r\ndemonstrated in relapsing fever. Laveran proved the association of\r\nhaematozoa with malaria in 1880. In the same year, Griffith Evans\r\ndiscovered trypanosomes in a disease of horses and cattle in India, and\r\nthe same type of parasite was found in the sleeping sickness. Amoebae\r\nwere demonstrated in one form of dysentery, and in other tropical\r\ndiseases protozoa were discovered, so that we were really prepared for\r\nthe announcement in 1905, by Schaudinn, of the discovery of a protozoan\r\nparasite in syphilis. Just fifty years had passed since Pasteur had\r\nsent in his paper on \"Lactic Acid Fermentation\" to the Lille Scientific\r\nSociety--half a century in which more had been done to determine the\r\ntrue nature of disease than in all the time that had passed since\r\nHippocrates. Celsus makes the oft-quoted remark that to determine\r\nthe cause of a disease often leads to the remedy,(*) and it is the\r\npossibility of removing the cause that gives such importance to the new\r\nresearches on disease.\r\n\r\n     (*) \"Et causae quoque estimatio saepe morbum solvit,\" Celsus,\r\n     Lib.  I, Prefatio.--Ed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNAL SECRETIONS\r\n\r\nONE of the greatest contributions of the nineteenth century to\r\nscientific medicine was the discovery of the internal secretions of\r\norgans. The basic work on the subject was done by Claude Bernard, a\r\npupil of the great Magendie, whose saying it is well to remember--\"When\r\nentering a laboratory one should leave theories in the cloakroom.\" More\r\nthan any other man of his generation, Claude Bernard appreciated the\r\nimportance of experiment in practical medicine. For him the experimental\r\nphysician was the physician of the future--a view well borne out by the\r\ninfluence his epoch-making work has had on the treatment of disease. His\r\nstudies on the glycogenic functions of the liver opened the way for the\r\nmodern fruitful researches on the internal secretions of the various\r\nglands. About the same time that Bernard was developing the laboratory\r\nside of the problem, Addison, a physician to Guy's Hospital, in 1855,\r\npointed out the relation of a remarkable group of symptoms to disease\r\nof the suprarenal glands, small bodies situated above the kidneys, the\r\nimportance of which had not been previously recognized. With the loss\r\nof the function of these glands by disease, the body was deprived of\r\nsomething formed by them which was essential to its proper working.\r\nThen, in the last third of the century, came in rapid succession the\r\ndemonstration of the relations of the pancreas to diabetes, of the vital\r\nimportance of the thyroid gland and of the pituitary body. Perhaps no\r\nmore striking illustration of the value of experimental medicine has\r\never been given than that afforded by the studies upon those glands.\r\n\r\nThe thyroid body, situated in the neck and the enlargement of which is\r\ncalled goitre, secretes substances which pass into the blood, and\r\nwhich are necessary for the growth of the body in childhood, for the\r\ndevelopment of the mind and for the nutrition of the tissues of the\r\nskin. If, following an infectious disease, a child has wasting of this\r\ngland, or if, living in a certain district, it has a large goitre,\r\nnormal development does not take place, and the child does not grow in\r\nmind or body and becomes what is called a cretin. More than this--if in\r\nadult life the gland is completely removed, or if it wastes, a somewhat\r\nsimilar condition is produced, and the patient in time loses his mental\r\npowers and becomes fat and flabby--myxedematous. It has been shown\r\nexperimentally in various ways that the necessary elements of the\r\nsecretion can be furnished by feeding with the gland or its extracts,\r\nand that the cretinoid or myxedematous conditions could thus be cured or\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nExperimental work has also demonstrated the functions of the suprarenal\r\nglands and explained the symptoms of Addison's disease, and chemists\r\nhave even succeeded in making synthetically the active principle\r\nadrenalin.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no more fascinating story in the history of science\r\nthan that of the discovery of these so-called ductless glands. Part\r\nof its special interest is due to the fact that clinicians, surgeons,\r\nexperimental physiologists, pathologists and chemists have all combined\r\nin splendid teamwork to win the victory. No such miracles have ever\r\nbefore been wrought by physicians as those which we see in connection\r\nwith the internal secretion of the thyroid gland. The myth of bringing\r\nthe dead back to life has been associated with the names of many great\r\nhealers since the incident of Empedocles and Pantheia, but nowadays the\r\ndead in mind and the deformed in body may be restored by the touch\r\nof the magic wand of science. The study of the interaction of these\r\ninternal secretions, their influence upon development, upon mental\r\nprocess and upon disorders of metabolism is likely to prove in the\r\nfuture of a benefit scarcely less remarkable than that which we have\r\ntraced in the infectious diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY\r\n\r\nIT is not making too strong a statement to say that the chemistry and\r\nchemical physics of the nineteenth century have revolutionized\r\nthe world. It is difficult to realize that Liebig's famous Giessen\r\nlaboratory, the first to be opened to students for practical study, was\r\nfounded in the year 1825. Boyle, Cavendish, Priestley, Lavoisier, Black,\r\nDalton and others had laid a broad foundation, and Young, Frauenhofer,\r\nRumford, Davy, Joule, Faraday, Clerk-Maxwell, Helmholtz and others\r\nbuilt upon that and gave us the new physics and made possible our age\r\nof electricity. New technique and new methods have given a powerful\r\nstimulus to the study of the chemical changes that take place in the\r\nbody, which, only a few years ago, were matters largely of speculation.\r\n\"Now,\" in the words of Professor Lee, \"we recognize that, with its\r\nliving and its non-living substances inextricably intermingled, the\r\nbody constitutes an intensive chemical laboratory in which there is ever\r\noccurring a vast congeries of chemical reactions; both constructive and\r\ndestructive processes go on; new protoplasm takes the place of old. We\r\ncan analyze the income of the body and we can analyze its output, and\r\nfrom these data we can learn much concerning the body's chemistry. A\r\ngreat improvement in the method of such work has recently been secured\r\nby the device of inclosing the person who is the subject of the\r\nexperiment in a respiration calorimeter. This is an air-tight chamber,\r\nartificially supplied with a constant stream of pure air, and from which\r\nthe expired air, laden with the products of respiration, is withdrawn\r\nfor purposes of analysis. The subject may remain in the chamber for\r\ndays, the composition of all food and all excrete being determined, and\r\nall heat that is given off being measured. Favorable conditions are\r\nthus established for an exact study of many problems of nutrition. The\r\ndifficulties increase when we attempt to trace the successive steps in\r\nthe corporeal pathway of molecule and atom. Yet these secrets of the\r\nvital process are also gradually being revealed. When we remember that\r\nit is in this very field of nutrition that there exist great popular\r\nignorance and a special proneness to fad and prejudice, we realize how\r\npractically helpful are such exact studies of metabolism.\"(13)\r\n\r\n     (13) Frederick S. Lee, Ph.D.: Scientific Features of Modern\r\n     Medicine, New York, 1911.  I would like to call attention to this\r\n     work of Professor Lee's as presenting all the scientific features\r\n     of modern medicine in a way admirably adapted for anyone, lay or\r\n     medical, who wishes to get a clear sketch of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI -- THE RISE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE\r\n\r\nTHE story so far has been of men and of movements--of men who have,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, initiated great movements, and of\r\nmovements by which, nolens volens, the men of the time were moulded and\r\ncontrolled. Hippocrates, in the tractate on \"Ancient Medicine,\" has a\r\nsplendid paragraph on the attitude of mind towards the men of the past.\r\nMy attention was called to it one day in the Roman Forum by Commendatore\r\nBoni, who quoted it as one of the great sayings of antiquity. Here it\r\nis: \"But on that account, I say, we ought not to reject the ancient Art,\r\nas if it were not, and had not been properly founded, because it did\r\nnot attain accuracy in all things, but rather, since it is capable of\r\nreaching to the greatest exactitude by reasoning, to receive it and\r\nadmire its discoveries, made from a state of great ignorance, and as\r\nhaving been well and properly made, and not from chance.\"(1)\r\n\r\n     (1) The Works of Hippocrates, Adams, Vol. I, p. 168, London, 1849\r\n     (Sydenham Society).\r\n\r\nI have tried to tell you what the best of these men in successive ages\r\nknew, to show you their point of outlook on the things that interest\r\nus. To understand the old writers one must see as they saw, feel as they\r\nfelt, believe as they believed--and this is hard, indeed impossible! We\r\nmay get near them by asking the Spirit of the Age in which they lived\r\nto enter in and dwell with us, but it does not always come. Literary\r\ncriticism is not literary history--we have no use here for the former,\r\nbut to analyze his writings is to get as far as we can behind the\r\ndoors of a man's mind, to know and appraise his knowledge, not from our\r\nstandpoint, but from that of his contemporaries, his predecessors and\r\nhis immediate successors. Each generation has its own problems to face,\r\nlooks at truth from a special focus and does not see quite the same\r\noutlines as any other. For example, men of the present generation\r\ngrow up under influences very different from those which surrounded my\r\ngeneration in the seventies of the last century, when Virchow and\r\nhis great contemporaries laid the sure and deep foundations of modern\r\npathology. Which of you now knows the \"Cellular Pathology\" as we did? To\r\nmany of you it is a closed book,--to many more Virchow may be thought a\r\nspent force. But no, he has only taken his place in a great galaxy. We\r\ndo not forget the magnitude of his labors, but a new generation has new\r\nproblems--his message was not for you--but that medicine today runs in\r\nlarger moulds and turns out finer castings is due to his life and work.\r\nIt is one of the values of lectures on the history of medicine to\r\nkeep alive the good influences of great men even after their positive\r\nteaching is antiquated. Let no man be so foolish as to think that he has\r\nexhausted any subject for his generation. Virchow was not happy when he\r\nsaw the young men pour into the old bottle of cellular pathology the new\r\nwine of bacteriology. Lister could never understand how aseptic surgery\r\narose out of his work. Ehrlich would not recognize his epoch-making\r\nviews on immunity when this generation has finished with them. I believe\r\nit was Hegel who said that progress is a series of negations--the\r\ndenial today of what was accepted yesterday, the contradiction by each\r\ngeneration of some part at least of the philosophy of the last; but all\r\nis not lost, the germ plasm remains, a nucleus of truth to be fertilized\r\nby men often ignorant even of the body from which it has come. Knowledge\r\nevolves, but in such a way that its possessors are never in sure\r\npossession. \"It is because science is sure of nothing that it is always\r\nadvancing\" (Duclaux).\r\n\r\nHistory is the biography of the mind of man, and its educational\r\nvalue is in direct proportion to the completeness of our study of the\r\nindividuals through whom this mind has been manifested. I have tried\r\nto take you back to the beginnings of science, and to trace its gradual\r\ndevelopment, which is conditioned by three laws. In the first place,\r\nlike a living organism, truth grows, and its gradual evolution may\r\nbe traced from the tiny germ to the mature product. Never springing,\r\nMinerva-like, to full stature at once, truth may suffer all the hazards\r\nincident to generation and gestation. Much of history is a record of the\r\nmishaps of truths which have struggled to the birth, only to die or else\r\nto wither in premature decay. Or the germ may be dormant for centuries,\r\nawaiting the fullness of time.\r\n\r\nSecondly, all scientific truth is conditioned by the state of knowledge\r\nat the time of its announcement. Thus, at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, the science of optics and mechanical appliances had\r\nnot made possible (so far as the human mind was concerned) the existence\r\nof blood capillaries and blood corpuscles. Jenner could not have\r\nadded to his \"Inquiry\" a study on immunity; Sir William Perkin and the\r\nchemists made Koch technique possible; Pasteur gave the conditions that\r\nproduced Lister; Davy and others furnished the preliminaries necessary\r\nfor anaesthesia. Everywhere we find this filiation, one event following\r\nthe other in orderly sequence--\"Mind begets mind,\" as Harvey (De\r\nGeneratione) says; \"opinion is the source of opinion. Democritus with\r\nhis atoms, and Eudoxus with his chief good which he placed in pleasure,\r\nimpregnated Epicurus; the four elements of Empedocles, Aristotle;\r\nthe doctrines of the ancient Thebans, Pythagoras and Plato; geometry,\r\nEuclid.\"(2)\r\n\r\n     (2) Works of William Harvey, translated by Robert Willis, London,\r\n     1847, p. 532.\r\n\r\nAnd, thirdly, to scientific truth alone may the homo mensura principle\r\nbe applied, since of all mental treasures of the race it alone compels\r\ngeneral acquiescence. That this general acquiescence, this aspect of\r\ncertainty, is not reached per saltum, but is of slow, often of difficult\r\ngrowth,--marked by failures and frailties, but crowned at last with\r\nan acceptance accorded to no other product of mental activity,--is\r\nillustrated by every important discovery from Copernicus to Darwin.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is to get men to the thinking level which compels the\r\napplication of scientific truths. Protagoras, that \"mighty-wise man,\"\r\nas Socrates called him, who was responsible for the aphorism that man\r\nis the measure of all things, would have been the first to recognize the\r\nfolly of this standard for the people at large. But we have gradually\r\nreached a stage in which knowledge is translated into action, made\r\nhelpful for suffering humanity, just as the great discoveries in physics\r\nand chemistry have been made useful in the advance of civilization.\r\nWe have traced medicine through a series of upward steps--a primitive\r\nstage, in which it emerged from magic and religion into an empirical\r\nart, as seen among the Egyptians and Babylonians; a stage in which the\r\nnatural character of disease was recognized and the importance of its\r\nstudy as a phenomenon of nature was announced; a stage in which the\r\nstructure and functions of the human body were worked out; a stage in\r\nwhich the clinical and anatomical features of disease were determined;\r\na stage in which the causes of disorders were profitably studied, and\r\na final stage, into which we have just entered, the application of the\r\nknowledge for their prevention. Science has completely changed man's\r\nattitude towards disease.\r\n\r\nTake a recent concrete illustration. A couple of years ago in\r\nPhiladelphia and in some other parts of the United States, a very\r\npeculiar disease appeared, characterized by a rash upon the skin and\r\nmoderate fever, and a constitutional disturbance proportionate to the\r\nextent and severity of the eruption. The malady first broke out in the\r\nmembers of a crew of a private yacht; then in the crews of other boats,\r\nand among persons living in the boarding-houses along the docks. It was\r\nthe cause of a great deal of suffering and disability.\r\n\r\nThere were three courses open: to accept the disease as a visitation\r\nof God, a chastening affliction sent from above, and to call to aid the\r\nspiritual arm of the church. Except the \"Peculiar People\" few now take\r\nthis view or adopt this practice. The Christian Scientist would probably\r\ndeny the existence of the rash and of the fever, refuse to recognize\r\nthe itching and get himself into harmony with the Infinite. Thirdly, the\r\nmethod of experimental medicine.\r\n\r\nFirst, the conditions were studied under which the individual cases\r\noccurred. The only common factor seemed to be certain straw mattresses\r\nmanufactured by four different firms, all of which obtained the straw\r\nfrom the same source.\r\n\r\nThe second point was to determine the relation of the straw to the rash.\r\nOne of the investigators exposed a bare arm and shoulder for an hour\r\nbetween two mattresses. Three people voluntarily slept on the mattresses\r\nfor one night. Siftings from the straw were applied to the arm,\r\nunder all of which circumstances the rash quickly developed, showing\r\nconclusively the relation of the straw to the disease.\r\n\r\nThirdly, siftings from the straw and mattresses which had been\r\nthoroughly disinfected failed to produce the rash.\r\n\r\nAnd fourthly, careful inspection of the siftings of the straw disclosed\r\nliving parasites, small mites, which when applied to the skin quickly\r\nproduced the characteristic eruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSANITATION\r\n\r\nWHEN the thoughtful historian gets far enough away from the nineteenth\r\ncentury to see it as a whole, no single feature will stand out with\r\ngreater distinctness than the fulfilment of the prophecy of Descartes\r\nthat we could be freed from an infinity of maladies both of body and\r\nmind if we had sufficient knowledge of their causes and of all the\r\nremedies with which nature has provided us. Sanitation takes its place\r\namong the great modern revolutions--political, social and intellectual.\r\nGreat Britain deserves the credit for the first practical recognition of\r\nthe maxim salus populi suprema lex. In the middle and latter part of\r\nthe century a remarkable group of men, Southwood Smith, Chadwick, Budd,\r\nMurchison, Simon, Acland, Buchanan, J.W. Russell and Benjamin Ward\r\nRichardson, put practical sanitation on a scientific basis. Even\r\nbefore the full demonstration of the germ theory, they had grasped the\r\nconception that the battle had to be fought against a living contagion\r\nwhich found in poverty, filth and wretched homes the conditions for its\r\nexistence. One terrible disease was practically wiped out in twenty-five\r\nyears of hard work. It is difficult to realize that within the memory of\r\nmen now living, typhus fever was one of the great scourges of our large\r\ncities, and broke out in terrible epidemics--the most fatal of all to\r\nthe medical profession. In the severe epidemic in Ireland in the forties\r\nof the last century, one fifth of all the doctors in the island died\r\nof typhus. A better idea of the new crusade, made possible by new\r\nknowledge, is to be had from a consideration of certain diseases against\r\nwhich the fight is in active progress.\r\n\r\nNothing illustrates more clearly the interdependence of the sciences\r\nthan the reciprocal impulse given to new researches in pathology\r\nand entomology by the discovery of the part played by insects in the\r\ntransmission of disease. The flea, the louse, the bedbug, the house fly,\r\nthe mosquito, the tick, have all within a few years taken their places\r\nas important transmitters of disease. The fly population may be taken\r\nas the sanitary index of a place. The discovery, too, that insects are\r\nporters of disease has led to a great extension of our knowledge of\r\ntheir life history. Early in the nineties, when Dr. Thayer and I were\r\nbusy with the study of malaria in Baltimore, we began experiments on\r\nthe possible transmission of the parasites, and a tramp, who had been\r\na medical student, offered himself as a subject. Before we began, Dr.\r\nThayer sought information as to the varieties of mosquitoes known in\r\nAmerica, but sought in vain: there had at that time been no systematic\r\nstudy. The fundamental study which set us on the track was a\r\ndemonstration by Patrick Manson,(3) in 1879, of the association of\r\nfilarian disease with the mosquito. Many observations had already\r\nbeen made, and were made subsequently, on the importance of insects as\r\nintermediary hosts in the animal parasites, but the first really great\r\nscientific demonstration of a widespread infection through insects was\r\nby Theobald Smith, now of Harvard University, in 1889, in a study of\r\nTexas fever of cattle.(4) I well remember the deep impression made upon\r\nme by his original communication, which in completeness, in accuracy of\r\ndetail, in Harveian precision and in practical results remains one of\r\nthe most brilliant pieces of experimental work ever undertaken. It is\r\ndifficult to draw comparisons in pathology; but I think, if a census\r\nwere taken among the world's workers on disease, the judgment to be\r\nbased on the damage to health and direct mortality, the votes would be\r\ngiven to malaria as the greatest single destroyer of the human race.\r\nCholera kills its thousands, plague, in its bad years, its hundreds of\r\nthousands, yellow fever, hookworm disease, pneumonia, tuberculosis,\r\nare all terribly destructive, some only in the tropics, others in more\r\ntemperate regions: but malaria is today, as it ever was, a disease to\r\nwhich the word pandemic is specially applicable. In this country and in\r\nEurope, its ravages have lessened enormously during the past century,\r\nbut in the tropics it is everywhere and always present, the greatest\r\nsingle foe of the white man, and at times and places it assumes the\r\nproportions of a terrible epidemic. In one district of India alone,\r\nduring the last four months of 1908, one quarter of the total population\r\nsuffered from the disease and there were 400,000 deaths--practically\r\nall from malaria. Today, the control of this terrible scourge is in our\r\nhands, and, as I shall tell you in a few minutes, largely because of\r\nthis control, the Panama Canal is being built. No disease illustrates\r\nbetter the progressive evolution of scientific medicine. It is one of\r\nthe oldest of known diseases. The Greeks and Graeco-Romans knew it well.\r\nIt seems highly probable, as brought out by the studies of W.H.S. Jones\r\nof Cambridge, that, in part at least, the physical degeneration in\r\nGreece and Rome may have been due to the great increase of this disease.\r\nIts clinical manifestations were well known and admirably described by\r\nthe older writers. In the seventeenth century, as I have already told\r\nyou, the remarkable discovery was made that the bark of the cinchona\r\ntree was a specific. Between the date of the Countess's recovery in Lima\r\nand the year 1880 a colossal literature on the disease had accumulated.\r\nLiterally thousands of workers had studied the various aspects of its\r\nmany problems; the literature of this country, particularly of the\r\nSouthern States, in the first half of the last century may be said to\r\nbe predominantly malarial. Ordinary observation carried on for long\r\ncenturies had done as much as was possible. In 1880, a young French army\r\nsurgeon, Laveran by name, working in Algiers, found in the microscopic\r\nexamination of the blood that there were little bodies in the red blood\r\ncorpuscles, amoeboid in character, which he believed to be the germs of\r\nthe disease. Very little attention at first was paid to his work, and it\r\nis not surprising. It was the old story of \"Wolf, wolf\"; there had been\r\nso many supposed \"germs\" that the profession had become suspicious.\r\nSeveral years elapsed before Surgeon-General Sternberg called the\r\nattention of the English-speaking world to Laveran's work: it was taken\r\nup actively in Italy, and in America by Councilman, Abbott and by others\r\namong us in Baltimore. The result of these widespread observations\r\nwas the confirmation in every respect of Laveran's discovery of the\r\nassociation with malaria of a protozoan parasite. This was step\r\nnumber three. Clinical observation, empirical discovery of the cure,\r\ndetermination of the presence of a parasite. Two other steps followed\r\nrapidly. Another army surgeon, Ronald Ross, working in India, influenced\r\nby the work of Manson, proved that the disease was transmitted by\r\ncertain varieties of mosquitoes. Experiments came in to support the\r\nstudies in etiology; two of those may be quoted. Mosquitoes which had\r\nbitten malarial patients in Italy were sent to London and there allowed\r\nto bite Mr. Manson, son of Dr. Manson. This gentleman had not lived out\r\nof England, where there is now no acute malaria. He had been a perfectly\r\nhealthy, strong man. In a few days following the bites of the infected\r\nmosquitoes, he had a typical attack of malarial fever.\r\n\r\n     (3) Journal Linnaean Society, London, 1879, XIV, 304-311.\r\n\r\n     (4) Medical News, Philadelphia, 1889, LV, 689-693, and monograph\r\n     with Kilborne, Washington, 1893.\r\n\r\nThe other experiment, though of a different character, is quite as\r\nconvincing. In certain regions about Rome, in the Campania, malaria is\r\nso prevalent that, in the autumn, almost everyone in the district is\r\nattacked, particularly if he is a newcomer. Dr. Sambon and a friend\r\nlived in this district from June 1 to September 1, 1900. The test was\r\nwhether they could live in this exceedingly dangerous climate for\r\nthe three months without catching malaria, if they used stringent\r\nprecautions against the bites of mosquitoes. For this purpose the hut\r\nin which they lived was thoroughly wired, and they slept under netting.\r\nBoth of these gentlemen, at the end of the period, had escaped the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThen came the fifth and final triumph--the prevention of the disease.\r\nThe anti-malarial crusade which has been preached by Sir Ronald Ross and\r\nhas been carried out successfully on a wholesale scale in Italy and in\r\nparts of India and Africa, has reduced enormously the incidence of\r\nthe disease. Professor Celli of Rome, in his lecture room, has an\r\ninteresting chart which shows the reduction in the mortality from\r\nmalaria in Italy since the preventive measures have been adopted--the\r\ndeaths have fallen from above 28,000 in 1888 to below 2000 in 1910.\r\nThere is needed a stirring campaign against the disease throughout the\r\nSouthern States of this country.\r\n\r\nThe story of yellow fever illustrates one of the greatest practical\r\ntriumphs of scientific medicine; indeed, in view of its far-reaching\r\ncommercial consequences, it may range as one of the first achievements\r\nof the race. Ever since the discovery of America, the disease has been\r\none of its great scourges, permanently endemic in the Spanish Main,\r\noften extending to the Southern States, occasionally into the North, and\r\nnot infrequently it has crossed the Atlantic. The records of the British\r\nArmy in the West Indies show an appalling death rate, chiefly from this\r\ndisease. At Jamaica, for the twenty years ending in 1836, the average\r\nmortality was 101 per thousand, and in certain instances as high as 178.\r\nOne of the most dreaded of all infections, the periods of epidemics in\r\nthe Southern States have been the occasions of a widespread panic with\r\ncomplete paralysis of commerce. How appalling the mortality is may be\r\njudged from the outbreak in Philadelphia in 1793, when ten thousand\r\npeople died in three months.(5) The epidemics in Spain in the early part\r\nof the nineteenth century were of great severity. A glance through\r\nLa Roche's great book(6) on the subject soon gives one an idea of\r\nthe enormous importance of the disease in the history of the Southern\r\nStates. Havana, ever since its foundation, had been a hotbed of yellow\r\nfever. The best minds of the profession had been attracted to a solution\r\nof the problem, but all in vain. Commission after commission had been\r\nappointed, with negative results; various organisms had been described\r\nas the cause, and there were sad illustrations of the tragedy associated\r\nwith investigations undertaken without proper training or proper\r\ntechnique. By the year 1900, not only had the ground been cleared,\r\nbut the work on insect-borne disease by Manson and by Ross had given\r\nobservers an important clue. It had repeatedly been suggested that\r\nsome relation existed between the bites of mosquitoes and the tropical\r\nfevers, particularly by that remarkable student, Nott of Mobile, and\r\nthe French physician, Beauperthuy. But the first to announce clearly the\r\nmosquito theory of the disease was Carlos Finlay of Havana. Early in the\r\nspring of 1900, during the occupation of Cuba by the United States, a\r\ncommission appointed by Surgeon-General Sternberg (himself one of the\r\nmost energetic students of the disease) undertook fresh investigations.\r\nDr. Walter Reed, Professor of Bacteriology in the Army Medical School,\r\nwas placed in charge: Dr. Carroll of the United States Army, Dr.\r\nAgramonte of Havana and Dr. Jesse W. Lazear were the other members. At\r\nthe Johns Hopkins Hospital, we were deeply interested in the work, as\r\nDr. Walter Reed was a favorite pupil of Professor Welch, a warm friend\r\nof all of us, and a frequent visitor to our laboratories. Dr. Jesse\r\nLazear, who had been my house physician, had worked with Dr. Thayer and\r\nmyself at malaria, and gave up the charge of my clinical laboratory to\r\njoin the commission.\r\n\r\n     (5) Matthew Carey:  A Short Account of the Malignant Fever,\r\n     Philadelphia, 1793.\r\n\r\n     (6) R. La Roche:  Yellow Fever, 2 vols., Philadelphia, 1855.\r\n\r\nMany scientific discoveries have afforded brilliant illustrations of\r\nmethod in research, but in the work of these men one is at a loss to\r\nknow which to admire more--the remarkable accuracy and precision of the\r\nexperiments, or the heroism of the men--officers and rank and file of\r\nthe United States Army; they knew all the time that they were playing\r\nwith death, and some of them had to pay the penalty! The demonstration\r\nwas successful--beyond peradventure--that yellow fever could be\r\ntransmitted by mosquitoes, and equally the negative proposition--that it\r\ncould not be transmitted by fomites. An interval of twelve or more days\r\nwas found to be necessary after the mosquito has bitten a yellow fever\r\npatient before it is capable of transmitting the infection. Lazear\r\npermitted himself to be bitten by a stray mosquito while conducting his\r\nexperiments in the yellow fever hospital. Bitten on the thirteenth, he\r\nsickened on the eighteenth and died on the twenty-fifth of September,\r\nbut not until he had succeeded in showing in two instances that\r\nmosquitoes could convey the infection. He added another to the long list\r\nof members of the profession who have laid down their lives in search\r\nof the causes of disease. Of such men as Lazear and of Myers of the\r\nLiverpool Yellow-Fever Commission, Dutton and young Manson, may fitly be\r\nsung from the noblest of American poems the tribute which Lowell paid to\r\nHarvard's sons who fell in the War of Secession:\r\n\r\n     Many in sad faith sought for her,\r\n     Many with crossed hands sighed for her;\r\n     But these, our brothers, fought for her,\r\n     At life's dear peril wrought for her,\r\n     So loved her that they died for her.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the commander-in-chief at the time in Cuba was General\r\nLeonard Wood, who had been an army surgeon, and he was the first to\r\nappreciate the importance of the discovery. The sanitation of Havana was\r\nplaced in the hands of Dr. Gorgas, and within nine months the city was\r\ncleared of yellow fever, and, with the exception of a slight outbreak\r\nafter the withdrawal of the American troops, has since remained free\r\nfrom a disease which had been its scourge for centuries. As General Wood\r\nremarked, \"Reed's discovery has resulted in the saving of more lives\r\nannually than were lost in the Cuban War, and saves the commercial\r\ninterest of the world a greater financial loss each year than the\r\ncost of the Cuban War. He came to Cuba at a time when one third of the\r\nofficers of my staff died of yellow fever, and we were discouraged at\r\nthe failure of our efforts to control it.\" Following the example of\r\nHavana other centres were attacked, at Vera Cruz and in Brazil, with the\r\nsame success, and it is safe to say that now, thanks to the researches\r\nof Reed and his colleagues, with proper measures, no country need fear a\r\nparalyzing outbreak of this once dreaded disease.\r\n\r\nThe scientific researches in the last two decades of the nineteenth\r\ncentury made possible the completion of the Panama Canal. The narrow\r\nisthmus separating the two great oceans and joining the two great\r\ncontinents, has borne for four centuries an evil repute as the White\r\nMan's Grave. Silent upon a peak of Darien, stout Cortez with eagle eye\r\nhad gazed on the Pacific. As early as 1520, Saavedra proposed to cut\r\na canal through the Isthmus. There the first city was founded by the\r\nconquerors of the new world, which still bears the name of Panama.\r\nSpaniards, English and French fought along its coasts; to it the founder\r\nof the Bank of England took his ill-fated colony; Raleigh, Drake, Morgan\r\nthe buccaneer, and scores of adventurers seeking gold, found in fever an\r\nenemy stronger than the Spaniard. For years the plague-stricken Isthmus\r\nwas abandoned to the negroes and the half-breeds, until in 1849,\r\nstimulated by the gold fever of California, a railway was begun by\r\nthe American engineers, Totten and Trautwine, and completed in 1855,\r\na railway every tie of which cost the life of a man. The dream of\r\nnavigators and practical engineers was taken in hand by Ferdinand de\r\nLesseps in January, 1881. The story of the French Canal Company is a\r\ntragedy unparalleled in the history of finance, and, one may add, in the\r\nravages of tropical disease. Yellow fever, malaria, dysentery, typhus,\r\ncarried off in nine years nearly twenty thousand employees. The\r\nmortality frequently rose above 100, sometimes to 130, 140 and in\r\nSeptember, 1885, it reached the appalling figure of 176.97 per thousand\r\nwork people. This was about the maximum death rate of the British Army\r\nin the West Indies in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1904, the United States undertook to complete the Canal,\r\neveryone felt that the success or failure was largely a matter of\r\nsanitary control. The necessary knowledge existed, but under the\r\ncircumstances could it be made effective? Many were doubtful.\r\nFortunately, there was at the time in the United States Army a man who\r\nhad already served an apprenticeship in Cuba, and to whom more than to\r\nanyone else was due the disappearance of yellow fever from that island.\r\nTo a man, the profession in the United States felt that could Dr. Gorgas\r\nbe given full control of the sanitary affairs of the Panama Zone, the\r\nhealth problem, which meant the Canal problem, could be solved.\r\nThere was at first a serious difficulty relating to the necessary\r\nadministrative control by a sanitary officer. In an interview which Dr.\r\nWelch and I had with President Roosevelt, he keenly felt this difficulty\r\nand promised to do his best to have it rectified. It is an open secret\r\nthat at first, as was perhaps only natural, matters did not go very\r\nsmoothly, and it took a year or more to get properly organized. Yellow\r\nfever recurred on the Isthmus in 1904 and in the early part of 1905. It\r\nwas really a colossal task in itself to undertake the cleaning of the\r\ncity of Panama, which had been for centuries a pest-house, the mortality\r\nin which, even after the American occupation, reached during one\r\nmonth the rate of 71 per thousand living. There have been a great many\r\nbrilliant illustrations of the practical application of science in\r\npreserving the health of a community and in saving life, but it is safe\r\nto say that, considering the circumstances, the past history, and the\r\nextraordinary difficulties to be overcome, the work accomplished by\r\nthe Isthmian Canal Commission is unique. The year 1905 was devoted to\r\norganization; yellow fever was got rid of, and at the end of the year\r\nthe total mortality among the whites had fallen to 8 per thousand,\r\nbut among the blacks it was still high, 44. For three years, with a\r\nprogressively increasing staff which had risen to above 40,000, of whom\r\nmore than 12,000 were white, the death rate progressively fell.\r\n\r\nOf the six important tropical diseases, plague, which reached the\r\nIsthmus one year, was quickly held in check. Yellow fever, the most\r\ndreaded of them all, never recurred. Beri-beri, which in 1906 caused\r\nsixty-eight deaths, has gradually disappeared. The hookworm disease,\r\nankylostomiasis, has steadily decreased. From the very outset, malaria\r\nhas been taken as the measure of sanitary efficiency. Throughout the\r\nFrench occupation it was the chief enemy to be considered, not only\r\nbecause of its fatality, but on account of the prolonged incapacity\r\nfollowing infection. In 1906, out of every 1000 employees there were\r\nadmitted to the hospital from malaria 821; in 1907, 424; in 1908, 282;\r\nin 1912, 110; in 1915, 51; in 1917, 14. The fatalities from the disease\r\nhave fallen from 233 in 1906 to 154 in 1907, to 73 in 1908 and to 7 in\r\n1914. The death rate for malarial fever per 1000 population sank from\r\n8.49 in 1906 to 0.11 in 1918. Dysentery, next to malaria the most\r\nserious of the tropical diseases in the Zone, caused 69 deaths in 1906;\r\n48 in 1907; in 1908, with nearly 44,000, only 16 deaths, and in 1914,\r\n4.(*) But it is when the general figures are taken that we see the\r\nextraordinary reduction that has taken place. Out of every 1000 engaged\r\nin 1908 only a third of the number died that died in 1906, and half the\r\nnumber that died in 1907.\r\n\r\n     (*) Figures for recent years supplied by editors.\r\n\r\nIn 1914, the death rate from disease among white males had fallen to\r\n3.13 per thousand. The rate among the 2674 American women and children\r\nconnected with the Commission was only 9.72 per thousand. But by far the\r\nmost gratifying reduction is among the blacks, among whom the rate from\r\ndisease had fallen to the surprisingly low figure in 1912 of 8.77 per\r\nthousand; in 1906 it was 47 per thousand. A remarkable result is that\r\nin 1908 the combined tropical diseases--malaria, dysentery and\r\nberi-beri--killed fewer than the two great killing diseases of the\r\ntemperate zone, pneumonia and tuberculosis--127 in one group and 137\r\nin the other. The whole story is expressed in two words, EFFECTIVE\r\nORGANIZATION, and the special value of this experiment in sanitation is\r\nthat it has been made, and made successfully, in one of the great plague\r\nspots of the world.\r\n\r\nMonth by month a little, gray-covered pamphlet was published by Colonel\r\nGorgas, a \"Report of the Department of Sanitation of the Isthmian Canal\r\nCommission.\" I have been one of the favored to whom it has been sent\r\nyear by year, and, keenly interested as I have always been in infectious\r\ndiseases, and particularly in malaria and dysentery, I doubt if anyone\r\nhas read it more faithfully. In evidence of the extraordinary advance\r\nmade in sanitation by Gorgas, I give a random example from one of his\r\nmonthly reports (1912): In a population of more than 52,000, the death\r\nrate from disease had fallen to 7.31 per thousand; among the whites it\r\nwas 2.80 and among the colored people 8.77. Not only is the profession\r\nindebted to Colonel Gorgas and his staff for this remarkable\r\ndemonstration, but they have offered an example of thoroughness and\r\nefficiency which has won the admiration of the whole world. As J. B.\r\nBishop, secretary of the Isthmian Canal Commission, has recently said:\r\n\"The Americans arrived on the Isthmus in the full light of these two\r\ninvaluable discoveries (the insect transmission of yellow fever and\r\nmalaria). Scarcely had they begun active work when an outbreak of yellow\r\nfever occurred which caused such a panic throughout their force that\r\nnothing except the lack of steamship accommodation prevented the flight\r\nof the entire body from the Isthmus. Prompt, intelligent and vigorous\r\napplication of the remedies shown to be effective by the mosquito\r\ndiscoveries not only checked the progress of the pest, but banished\r\nit forever from the Isthmus. In this way, and in this alone, was\r\nthe building of the canal made possible. The supreme credit for its\r\nconstruction therefore belongs to the brave men, surgeons of the United\r\nStates Army, who by their high devotion to duty and to humanity risked\r\ntheir lives in Havana in 1900-1901 to demonstrate the truth of the\r\nmosquito theory.\"(7)\r\n\r\n     (7) Bishop:  The French at Panama, Scribner's Magazine, January,\r\n     1913, p. 42.\r\n\r\nOne disease has still a special claim upon the public in this country.\r\nSome fourteen or fifteen years ago, in an address on the problem of\r\ntyphoid fever in the United States, I contended that the question was\r\nno longer in the hands of the profession. In season and out of season\r\nwe had preached salvation from it in volumes which fill state reports,\r\npublic health journals and the medical periodicals. Though much has been\r\ndone, typhoid fever remains a question of grave national concern. You\r\nlost in this state(7a) in 1911 from typhoid fever 154 lives, every one\r\nsacrificed needlessly, every one a victim of neglect and incapacity.\r\nBetween 1200 and 1500 persons had a slow, lingering illness. A nation of\r\ncontradictions and paradoxes--a clean people, by whom personal hygiene\r\nis carefully cultivated, but it has displayed in matters of public\r\nsanitation a carelessness simply criminal: a sensible people, among whom\r\neducation is more widely diffused than in any other country, supinely\r\nacquiesces in conditions often shameful beyond expression. The solution\r\nof the problem is not very difficult. What has been done elsewhere can\r\nbe done here. It is not so much in the cities, though here too the death\r\nrate is still high, but in the smaller towns and rural districts, in\r\nmany of which the sanitary conditions are still those of the Middle\r\nAges. How Galen would have turned up his nose with contempt at the\r\nwater supply of the capital of the Dominion of Canada, scourged so\r\ndisgracefully by typhoid fever of late! There is no question that the\r\npublic is awakening, but many State Boards of Health need more efficient\r\norganization, and larger appropriations. Others are models, and it is\r\nnot for lack of example that many lag behind. The health officers should\r\nhave special training in sanitary science and special courses leading to\r\ndiplomas in public health should be given in the medical schools. Were\r\nthe health of the people made a question of public and not of party\r\npolicy, only a skilled expert could possibly be appointed as a public\r\nhealth officer, not, as is now so often the case, the man with the\r\npolitical pull.\r\n\r\n     (7a) Connecticut.\r\n\r\nIt is a long and tragic story in the annals of this country. That\r\ndistinguished man, the first professor of physic in this University\r\nin the early years of last century, Dr. Nathan Smith, in that notable\r\nmonograph on \"Typhus Fever\" (1824), tells how the disease had followed\r\nhim in his various migrations, from 1787, when he began to practice, all\r\nthrough his career, and could he return this year, in some hundred and\r\nforty or one hundred and fifty families of the state he would find\r\nthe same miserable tragedy which he had witnessed so often in the\r\nsame heedless sacrifice of the young on the altar of ignorance and\r\nincapacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBERCULOSIS\r\n\r\nIN a population of about one million, seventeen hundred persons died of\r\ntuberculosis in this state in the year 1911--a reduction in thirty years\r\nof nearly 50 per cent. A generation has changed completely our outlook\r\non one of the most terrible scourges of the race. It is simply appalling\r\nto think of the ravages of this disease in civilized communities. Before\r\nthe discovery by Robert Koch of the bacillus, we were helpless and\r\nhopeless; in an Oriental fatalism we accepted with folded hands a state\r\nof affairs which use and wont had made bearable. Today, look at the\r\ncontrast! We are both helpful and hopeful. Knowing the cause of the\r\ndisease, knowing how it is distributed, better able to recognize the\r\nearly symptoms, better able to cure a very considerable portion of all\r\nearly cases, we have gradually organized an enthusiastic campaign which\r\nis certain to lead to victory. The figures I have quoted indicate\r\nhow progressively the mortality is falling. Only, do not let us be\r\ndisappointed if this comparatively rapid fall is not steadily maintained\r\nin the country at large. It is a long fight against a strong enemy,\r\nand at the lowest estimate it will take several generations before\r\ntuberculosis is placed at last, with leprosy and typhus, among the\r\nvanquished diseases. Education, organization, cooperation--these are the\r\nweapons of our warfare. Into details I need not enter. The work done by\r\nthe National Association under the strong guidance of its secretary, Mr.\r\nFarrand, the pioneer studies of Trudeau and the optimism which he has\r\nbrought into the campaign, the splendid demonstration by the New York\r\nBoard of Health of what organization can do, have helped immensely in\r\nthis world-wide conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME years ago, in an address at Edinburgh, I spoke of the triple gospel\r\nwhich man has published--of his soul, of his goods, of his body. This\r\nthird gospel, the gospel of his body, which brings man into relation\r\nwith nature, has been a true evangelion, the glad tidings of the final\r\nconquest of nature by which man has redeemed thousands of his fellow men\r\nfrom sickness and from death.\r\n\r\nIf, in the memorable phrase of the Greek philosopher, Prodicus, \"That\r\nwhich benefits human life is God,\" we may see in this new gospel a link\r\nbetwixt us and the crowning race of those who eye to eye shall look on\r\nknowledge, and in whose hand nature shall be an open book--an approach\r\nto the glorious day of which Shelley sings so gloriously:\r\n\r\n     Happiness\r\n     And Science dawn though late upon the earth;\r\n     Peace cheers the mind, health renovates the frame;\r\n     Disease and pleasure cease to mingle here,\r\n     Reason and passion cease to combat there,\r\n     Whilst mind unfettered o'er the earth extends\r\n     Its all-subduing energies, and wields\r\n     The sceptre of a vast dominion there.\r\n\r\n     (Daemon of the World, Pt.
