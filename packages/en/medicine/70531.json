LXIV.)\r\n\r\n                      PRINTED BY C. AND J. ADLARD,\r\n                           BARTHOLOMEW CLOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough in the Preface which immediately follows, and which is reprinted\r\nwith slight alterations from the former edition, I have entered, at\r\nsome length, upon the subject of the following translation, I felt it\r\nnecessary, in the circumstances under which my work now appears, to\r\npremise a few additional remarks.\r\n\r\nIt is now many years since I undertook and completed a translation of\r\nthe whole works of Paulus Ægineta. In the year 1834 I published the\r\nfirst three books, with a commentary, having for its object to embody\r\nthe most important opinions of the Greek, Roman, and Arabian writers,\r\non all subjects treated of by the original author. Notwithstanding the\r\nvery favorable reception which that volume obtained from many of the\r\nmost eminent members of the medical profession, as well as from scholars\r\nboth at home and abroad, I was under the necessity—from circumstances\r\nwhich I need not here detail—of deviating from my original intention\r\nof completing the publication of the work in the same form and at my\r\nown risk. After an interval of ten years the proposition was made to me\r\nby the Council of the SYDENHAM SOCIETY to prepare a new edition of the\r\nvolume already published, and to complete the remaining two on the same\r\ngeneral plan. This proposition was too gratifying to my feelings not to\r\nbe immediately assented to; and it is with unfeigned satisfaction that\r\nI have now the honour to submit the first volume of the work to the\r\nmembers of so distinguished and important a Society.\r\n\r\nIn preparing this volume for the press, knowing that it will now be\r\nsubjected to the criticisms of a very numerous and intelligent body of my\r\nprofessional brethren, I have been anxious to render it worthy of their\r\napprobation as far as lay in my power. At the request of the Council I\r\nhave made considerable omissions in my commentary as formerly printed,\r\nmore especially in regard to modern authorities; it being thought\r\nadvisable not to bring the annotations further down than the period of\r\nthe Arabian writers. I have also made not a few additions and alterations\r\nwhich I hope will be considered as improvements. In performing this part\r\nof my task I have greatly profited by the aid and valuable criticisms\r\nof two esteemed friends, Sir William Hamilton of Edinburgh, and Dr.\r\nGreenhill of Oxford.\r\n\r\nI am sensible that it is to the growing conviction in the profession,\r\nof the value of the ancient authorities, that I owe the very flattering\r\ndistinction which my work has now obtained; and I shall have great\r\nsatisfaction in reverting to the labours of former years if they should\r\nnow prove instrumental in increasing the desire of becoming acquainted\r\nwith the views and practice of our forefathers. That the ancient\r\nliterature of medicine has been too much neglected in this country is not\r\ndisputed by any competent judge; and it would appear from the remarks\r\nof M. Hecker, in his address to the physicians of Germany, given in his\r\nadmirable work on Epidemics,[1] that the profession on the Continent is\r\nnot much in advance of us in this respect.\r\n\r\n    [1] Dr. Babington’s Translation; Sydenham edition, p. xv.\r\n\r\nThe time, however, it is to be hoped, is not far distant when the medical\r\nprofession will everywhere be impressed with the importance of becoming\r\nproperly acquainted with the views of the animal economy and of its\r\nderangements, entertained by three of the most intellectual nations of\r\nmankind; and when every newly-broached hypothesis will be tested by a\r\ncomparison with doctrines of a similar nature advanced in former days,\r\nand every newly-proposed remedy will be subjected to a like ordeal.\r\nSurely every age ought to endeavour to benefit by the experiments,\r\nwhether successful or otherwise, of all preceding ones; instead of every\r\ngeneration commencing a new series of trials, and wandering over the same\r\nground in search of truths which had been long ago discovered; or in\r\nstumbling through the mazes of error without regarding the beacons set\r\nup by their forefathers to direct the footsteps of their descendants. If\r\nthe wisdom of antiquity be entitled to high reverence in any case, it\r\nsurely is so in medicine, founded as this art especially is on general\r\nobservation and experience.\r\n\r\nWhat renders ancient medical literature of the more importance at the\r\npresent day, is the circumstance that it is almost our only source of\r\ninformation with regard to the diseases prevalent in several extensive\r\ncountries bordering upon the Mediterranean Sea. It is well known that\r\nthe inhabitants of Greece, of Asia Minor, and of the north coast of\r\nAfrica have been long sunk into such a state of intellectual decrepitude\r\nas renders them incapable of making and recording original observation;\r\nconsequently, for information in regard to the phenomena of disease, as\r\nmanifested in these regions, we are almost entirely thrown back upon the\r\nliterature of their ancestors.\r\n\r\nI take the present opportunity of adverting to one or two circumstances\r\nwhich I omitted to notice in my original preface.\r\n\r\nAn objection, I am well aware, will be made by some scholars to the\r\nmanner in which I have executed one part of my task. It is this:—that the\r\nreferences to ancient authors are often so vague, as to make it a matter\r\nof considerable difficulty to find the passages in the originals. It must\r\nbe admitted that there are grounds for this objection; and if I had the\r\nwork to do over again, I should most probably take pains to obviate it,\r\nin some degree, at least. But to remedy the omission, after the work\r\nwas completed on its present plan, would have been a task of immense\r\nlabour to me, without bringing a correspondent advantage to my readers.\r\nMoreover, I am convinced that, even as they stand, the references will,\r\nin general, be found sufficient to guide those who have an acquaintance\r\nwith the originals to the places indicated; and to those who are\r\nunacquainted with them, this strict system of quotation would be of no\r\nuse, further than to inspire them with a greater degree of confidence in\r\nthe accuracy and pains-taking research of the Editor. It may be proper\r\nfor me, then, to state that I have made it an invariable rule never to\r\nquote at second-hand, nor to make any reference to the opinions of an\r\nauthor whose works I have not myself carefully examined.\r\n\r\nMany readers, I fear, will find considerable difficulty with the names\r\nof the Compound Medicines which occur throughout this volume; and may\r\nbe disposed to think it was the duty of the Commentator to explain them\r\nas they occur. In answer to this objection, I beg to state, that these\r\ncompositions will be fully described in the third and last volume, which\r\ntreats of the Materia Medica and Pharmacy; and on this account I thought\r\nit unnecessary to notice them elsewhere. The GENERAL INDEX, which will\r\nbe given at the end of the work, will also facilitate reference in such\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n                                                                     F. A.\r\n\r\nBANCHORY, _August 17th, 1844_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF VOL. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the additions which have been made of late years to the\r\nhistory of medical literature, it must still be admitted that there is\r\nnot, in the English language, any work which contains a full and accurate\r\naccount of the theoretical and practical knowledge possessed by the\r\nGreeks, Romans, and Arabians, on matters connected with medicine and\r\nsurgery. Nor, as far as I can learn, is the case very different with the\r\ncontinental languages. For, although the German and French have lately\r\nacquired several histories of medicine distinguished for their ability\r\nand research, the object of these works would appear to be confined to a\r\ngeneral exposition of the leading discoveries and revolutions in doctrine\r\nwhich marked each particular age or epoch in the profession; and I will\r\nventure to affirm that no person will be able to acquire from a perusal\r\nof them anything like a competent acquaintance with the minute details of\r\nancient practice. The design of the present publication is to supply the\r\ndeficiency, now adverted to, by giving a complete Manual of the Surgery\r\nand Medicine of the Ancients, with a brief but comprehensive outline of\r\nthe sciences intimately connected with them, especially Physiology, the\r\nMateria Medica, and Pharmacy. At first it was my intention to accomplish\r\nthis purpose in the form of an original work, but, being perplexed what\r\nplan to choose in arranging the multifarious matters which I had to\r\ntreat of, I at last resolved upon taking for my text-book the celebrated\r\nsynopsis of PAULUS ÆGINETA, whereby I was at once supplied with a\r\nconvenient arrangement of my subject, and at the same time, by giving\r\na close translation of it into English, I saw that I would be enabled\r\nto enrich our medical literature with one of the most valuable relics\r\nof ancient science. By following this correct and faithful guide, by\r\nsupplying his omissions and enlarging his plan, when necessary, from the\r\nmore copious works of his predecessors, and by adding, in all cases,\r\nthe improvements of subsequent ages, down to the latest date of ancient\r\nliterature, I am in hopes that I have been able to present the reader\r\nwith a work from which he may, at one view, become acquainted with\r\nthe prevailing opinions upon all the most important matters connected\r\nwith medical practice during a period of more than fifteen centuries.\r\nImpressed with a sense of the arduous nature of the task which I had\r\nundertaken, and sensible that its value consists entirely in its\r\ncompleteness on all points, I have endeavoured to discharge this duty\r\nfaithfully and to the best of my ability. I trust then it will be found\r\nthat not only have I overlooked no treatise connected with the medical\r\nart which has come down to us from antiquity, but that I have turned\r\nto good account my acquaintance with the learned labours of modern\r\ncommentators, especially in the department of the Materia Medica, in\r\norder to adopt the nomenclature of the ancients on these subjects to the\r\nterminology of Botany, Chemistry, and Mineralogy, in the present time.\r\n\r\nAnd here may I be permitted to express my conviction that it is not\r\naltogether the blindness of partiality contracted towards intellectual\r\npursuits upon which my mind has been so long engaged, that leads me\r\nto think that the original authors from whose stores I have drawn so\r\nliberally, will yet be found and acknowledged to have been well entitled\r\nto the confidence and reputation which they once enjoyed, and to which\r\nit is my wish that the present publication should, in some degree,\r\nrestore them? It appears to me that, at certain periods of ancient\r\ntimes, the standard of professional excellence was such as would not\r\neasily be attained at the present day, with all our vaunted improvements\r\nin knowledge; and that many of those early masters of our art were\r\ndistinguished for varied stores of erudition, an ardent love of truth,\r\nand an aptitude to detect the fallacies of error, such as few of us\r\neven now can lay claim to. The Father of Medicine held that, to become\r\nan eminent physician, it was necessary not only to be well acquainted\r\nwith the structure of the human frame, but also to be skilled in logic,\r\nastronomy, and other sciences (De Aer. Aq., &c.); and of him it may be\r\ntruly asserted, that he cultivated the art of medicine upon the strict\r\nprinciples of the inductive philosophy more than two thousand years\r\nbefore the world gave Lord Bacon the credit of introducing this method of\r\nphilosophising. His devoted admirer and follower, Galen, was evidently\r\nthe very _beau ideal_ of an accomplished physician; skilled in all the\r\nsciences of the day, in logic, mathematics, rhetoric, and the first\r\nphilosophy; to all these ornamental branches of knowledge he added a\r\nminute acquaintance with anatomy and physiology; a practical experience\r\nwith the phenomena of diseases as diversified by climate, situation, and\r\nthe varied modes of life; a singular perseverance in collecting facts;\r\nand an extraordinary ability for generalizing them. The contemporaries of\r\nCelsus regarded him not only as well acquainted with medical literature,\r\nbut also as being minutely skilled in every elegant and useful science\r\nwhich was known and cultivated at that remarkable period. And Rhases,\r\nthe Arabian, requires of him who aspires to eminence in the medical\r\nprofession, that, instead of wasting his earlier years in frequenting\r\nmusical and drinking parties, he should have spent them in conning over\r\nthe valuable records of ancient wisdom. “But the Sciolist,” says he, “who\r\ngives himself out for a proficient in the art, while he has scarcely even\r\na smattering of learning, will never be deserving of much confidence,\r\nnor ever attain any great eminence in his profession. For it can never\r\nbe that any individual, to whatever age he may reach, should be able to\r\ncomprehend in his mind a subject so vast and diffuse, except by treading\r\nupon the footsteps of the ancients; since the boundaries of the science\r\nfar exceed the narrow limits of the life of man, as is the case with most\r\nof the liberal arts as well as with medicine. The number of authors is\r\nnot small by whose labours the art has attained its present growth; and\r\nyet one may hope to master the monuments of their industry within the\r\nspace of a few years. Let us suppose that, in the course of a thousand\r\nyears, a thousand authors had made improvements in the profession; and\r\nthen a person who has diligently studied their works may improve his mind\r\nas much in knowledge as if he had devoted a thousand years to the study\r\nof medicine. But, when an acquaintance with former authors is despised,\r\nwhat need be expected from the efforts of a single person? For, however\r\nmuch he may surpass others in abilities, how is it to be supposed that\r\nhis private stock of knowledge should be at all worthy to compare with\r\nthe accumulated treasures of antiquity? In a word, he who has never\r\nturned over the pages of the ancient physicians, nor has formed to his\r\nmind a distinct conception of the nature of diseases before he enters the\r\nchambers of the sick, will find that, from ignorance and misapprehension,\r\nhe will confound one complaint with another, for this obvious reason,\r\nthat he has come to his task unprepared and uninstructed.”\r\n\r\nAnd here I would beg to call the attention of my readers to the fact\r\nthat there is no legitimate mode of cultivating medical knowledge which\r\nwas not followed by some one or other of the three great sects into\r\nwhich the profession was divided in ancient times. The Empirics held\r\nthat observation, experiment, and the application of known remedies in\r\none case to others presumed to be of a similar nature, constitute the\r\nwhole art of cultivating medicine. Though their views were narrow, and\r\ntheir information scanty, when compared with some of the chiefs of the\r\nother sects; and although they rejected, as useless and unattainable,\r\nall knowledge of the causes and recondite nature of diseases, it is\r\nundeniable that, besides personal experience, they freely availed\r\nthemselves of historical detail, and of a strict analogy founded upon\r\nobservation and the resemblance of phenomena. To this class we may refer\r\nScribonius Largus, Marcellus, Plinius Valerianus, and a few others,\r\nfrequently quoted by us. The sect called the Rational, Logical, or\r\nDogmatical, holding that there is a certain alliance and connexion among\r\nall the useful and ornamental arts, maintained that it is the duty of\r\nthe physician not to neglect any collateral science or subject. They\r\ntherefore inquired sedulously into the remote and proximate causes of\r\ndiseases, and into the effects of airs, waters, places, pursuits, food,\r\ndiet, and seasons, in altering the state of the human body, and in\r\nrendering it more or less susceptible of morbid changes. Looking upon\r\ngeneral rules as not being of universal application, they held that\r\nthe treatment ought to be modified according to the many incidental\r\ncircumstances under which their patients might be placed. They freely\r\nand fully availed themselves of whatever aid they could derive from\r\nexperience, analogy, and reasoning. Hippocrates, Galen, Aëtius,\r\nOribasius, Paulus Ægineta, Actuarius, and all the Arabian authorities,\r\nmay be looked upon as belonging to this sect. The Pneumatic sect, to\r\nwhich Aretæus probably belonged, was nearly allied to the Dogmatical.\r\nThe sect of the Methodists, rejecting altogether the consideration of\r\nremote causes, which they held to be of no importance to the cure, and\r\ngiving themselves up to too bold a classification of diseases, according\r\nto certain hypothetical states of the body in which they were supposed\r\nto originate, fettered themselves too much with a few general rules,\r\nwhich they held to be so universally applicable, that they would scarcely\r\nallow of their being modified by incidental circumstances in any possible\r\ncontingency. Notwithstanding this defect, it is undeniable that their\r\nspeculations as to the nature of diseases are generally very acute, and\r\ntheir modes of treatment frequently very rational. Upon the whole, the\r\ngeneral outline of their system would appear to have borne a striking\r\nresemblance to that of the sect which started up in Edinburgh towards\r\nthe end of the last century, called the Brunonian, from the name of\r\nits ingenious but fanciful founder, Dr. Brown. The only perfect model\r\nof ancient Methodism that has come down to us is Cælius Aurelianus, an\r\nauthor so truly eminent that some of his admirers in modern times have\r\nnot scrupled to maintain that his works are even better worth being\r\nattentively studied than those of Hippocrates and Galen. Moschion and\r\nTheodore Priscian (otherwise known by the name of Octavius Horatianus)\r\nbelonged to this sect; Alexander of Tralles also had a considerable\r\nleaning to its principles; and some would even refer the illustrious\r\nCelsus to the same class, but probably without good reason, for he would\r\nrather seem to have imbibed the genuine spirit of Eclecticism, and like\r\nhis distinguished correspondent Horace, to have been\r\n\r\n    “Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri.”\r\n\r\nBefore concluding these prefatory remarks, it will be naturally expected\r\nthat I should say something of the author whose work I have bestowed\r\nso much pains in translating and commenting upon. Here, however, I\r\nmust regret that the information which I have to supply is exceedingly\r\nscanty and unsatisfactory. So little is known of him that it is not\r\neven ascertained in what century he flourished. Vossius is wholly\r\nundecided; Moreau and Le Clerc place him in the fourth century; Vander\r\nLinden and Conringius, in the fifth; but Freind, Albertus Fabricius,\r\nHutcheson, Sprengel, and most of the late writers of the Ancient History\r\nof Medicine, bring him down as low as the seventh century, upon the\r\nauthority of Abulfaragius; but every person who is at all acquainted with\r\nhis works will agree with me that any opinion of his on chronological\r\nmatters is entitled to very little consideration indeed.\r\n\r\nWhat confidence does a writer deserve who states, for example, that\r\nAndromachus, the physician who added the flesh of vipers to the\r\ncelebrated electuary of Mithridates, lived in the time of Alexander\r\nthe Great!—that Dioscorides, of Ain Zarba, flourished in the reign of\r\nPtolemy Physcon, namely, about one hundred and twenty years before\r\nChrist, whereas it can scarcely admit of a doubt that the celebrated\r\nauthor of the Greek Materia Medica did not live earlier than the end of\r\nthe first century of the Christian era!—and that Ruffus was contemporary\r\nwith Plato, when we have the authority of Suidas that he lived in\r\nthe reign of Trajan! Dr. Milward, in his epistle to Sir Hans Sloane,\r\nendeavours to settle the age of our author from the following train of\r\ninferences: In the first place, then, since Paulus quotes Alexander\r\nTrallian and Alexander Aëtius, it is quite certain that our author was\r\nposterior to both these writers. Now the age of Aëtius may be made out\r\nfrom the following circumstances: Aëtius mentions St. Cyril, Archbishop\r\nof Alexandria, whose death is ascertained from ecclesiastical history\r\nto have happened as late as the middle of the fifth century. Nay, he\r\nalso takes notice of a medicine much recommended by Petrus Archiater,\r\nchief physician to Theodoric, who was posterior to St. Cyril. We cannot\r\npossibly suppose it likely, then, that Aëtius flourished earlier than the\r\nend of the fifth century. But what brings him still further down, is the\r\ncircumstance that his predecessor, Alexander, is mentioned by Agathias,\r\nthe historian, about the middle of the sixth century. (Hist. v, 6.)\r\nIt would seem almost certain, therefore, taking all these things into\r\nconsideration, that our Author cannot have lived at an earlier period\r\nthan in the end of the sixth or the beginning of the seventh century.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever may have been the period at which he lived, there can be no\r\ndoubt that he attained great eminence in his profession, and continued\r\nto be looked up to as one of the highest authorities in Medicine and\r\nSurgery during a long succession of ages. His countryman Nonnus,\r\nalthough he does not mention him by name, gives a brief compendium of a\r\nconsiderable portion of his work; and Psellus does the same in politic\r\nverses of some elegance. All the medical authors, in a word, of the\r\ndistinguished Arabian period, quote his opinions in almost every page of\r\ntheir works, and never fail to recognize him as one of the most eminent\r\nof their Grecian masters. At the revival of literature in modern times,\r\nthe Latin translations of the Arabians continued for a time to be the\r\nordinary guides to practice; but when the superior merit of their Greek\r\noriginals came to be properly appreciated, our Author rose again into\r\nhigh consideration. As a proof of this, I may mention that the surgery\r\nof Fabricius ab Aquapendente is made up almost entirely from his works.\r\nPortal, therefore, had no good occasion for representing him as “one of\r\nthose unfortunate writers to whom posterity had not done justice.” I\r\nadmit, indeed, that for some time past, since professional research and\r\nthe study of ancient models have been superseded by a restless desire of\r\nnovelty in theory and in practice, he has not enjoyed that consideration\r\nto which he is justly entitled; but, in this respect, he has only shared\r\nthe fate of other names, equally eminent for their contributions to\r\nmedical science, who have now been suffered to fall into neglect.\r\n\r\nOf the Latin translations, which are very numerous, the most celebrated\r\nis that of Cornarius, published by Henry Stephens in his ‘Medicæ Artis\r\nPrincipes;’ which, however, after a careful examination, I have not\r\nfound to be so trustworthy as I expected to find it. There once existed\r\nan Arabic edition by Honain, or Joannitius, (see Choulant, Handb. der\r\nBücherkunde für die Aeltere Medicin,) but of it I know nothing. The only\r\npart which has been translated into any modern language is the Sixth\r\nBook, a French translation of which was published at Lyons, A. D. 1539.\r\nOf the original there are two editions, namely, the Aldine of 1528 and\r\nthe Basle of 1538, in neither of which is the text so accurate as could\r\nbe wished.\r\n\r\n                                                                     F. A.\r\n\r\nBANCHORY-TERNAN; _Nov. 12th, 1833_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not because the more ancient writers had omitted anything relative\r\nto the Art that I have composed this work, but in order to give a\r\ncompendious course of instruction; for, on the contrary, everything\r\nis handled by them properly, and without any omissions, whereas the\r\nmoderns have not only in the first place neglected the study of them,\r\nbut have also blamed them for prolixity. Wherefore, I have undertaken\r\nthe following Treatise, which, it is like, will serve as a commentary\r\nto those who may choose to consult it, whilst it will prove an exercise\r\nto me. For it appears strange that lawyers should be possessed of\r\ncompendious and, as they call them, popular legal synopses, in which are\r\ncontained the heads of all the laws, to serve for immediate use, whilst\r\nwe neglect these things, although they have it generally in their power\r\nto put off the investigation of any point not only for little but even\r\nfor a considerable time, whereas we can seldom or very rarely do so;\r\nfor, in many cases, necessity requires that we act promptly, and hence\r\nHippocrates has properly said, “the season is brief.” (Aph. 1, i.) For\r\ntheir business is generally conducted in the midst of cities, where\r\nthere is an abundant supply of books, whereas physicians have to act not\r\nonly in cities, in the fields, and in desert places, but also at sea in\r\nships, where such diseases sometimes suddenly break out as, in the event\r\nof procrastination, would occasion death, or at least incur the most\r\nimminent danger. But to remember all the rules of the healing art, and\r\nall the particular substances connected with it, is exceedingly difficult\r\nif not altogether impossible. On this account I have compiled this brief\r\ncollection from the works of the ancients, and have set down little of my\r\nown, except a few things which I have seen and tried in the practice of\r\nthe art. For being conversant with the most distinguished writers in the\r\nprofession, and in particular with Oribasius, who, in one work, has given\r\na select view of everything relating to health (he being posterior to\r\nGalen, and one of the still more recent authors), I have collected what\r\nwas best in them, and have endeavoured, if possible, not to pass by any\r\none distemper. For the work of Oribasius, comprehending seventy books,\r\ncontains indeed an exposition of the whole art, but it is not easily to\r\nbe procured by people at large on account of its bulk, whilst the epitome\r\nof it, inscribed to his son Eustathius, is deficient in some diseases\r\naltogether, and gives but an imperfect description of others, sometimes\r\nthe causes and diagnosis being omitted, and sometimes the proper plan of\r\ntreatment being forgotten, as well as other things which have occurred to\r\nmy recollection. Wherefore the present work will contain the description,\r\ncauses, and cure of all diseases, whether situated in parts of uniform\r\ntexture, in particular organs, or consisting of solutions of continuity,\r\nand that not merely in a summary way, but at as great length as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the First Book, you will find everything that relates to Hygiene, and\r\nto the preservation from, and correction of, distempers peculiar to the\r\nvarious ages, seasons, temperaments, and so forth; also, the powers and\r\nuses of the different articles of food, as is set forth in the chapter of\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nIn the Second is explained the whole doctrine of Fevers, an account of\r\ncertain matters relating to them being premised, such as excrementitious\r\ndischarges, critical days, and other appearances, and concluding with\r\ncertain symptoms which are the concomitants of fever.\r\n\r\nThe Third Book relates to Topical affections, beginning from the crown of\r\nthe head and descending down to the nails of the feet.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Book treats of those complaints which are external and exposed\r\nto view, and are not limited to one part of the body but affect various\r\nparts. Also, of Intestinal Worms and Dracunculi.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth treats of the Wounds and Bites of Venomous Animals; also of the\r\ndistemper called Hydrophobia, and of persons bitten by dogs which are\r\nmad, and by those which are not mad; and also of persons bitten by men.\r\nAfterwards it treats of deleterious substances, and the preservatives\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nIn the Sixth Book is contained everything relating to Surgery, both what\r\nrelates to the fleshy parts, such as the extraction of weapons; and to\r\nthe bones, which comprehends Fractures and Dislocations.\r\n\r\nIn the Seventh is contained an account of the Properties of all\r\nMedicines, first of the Simple, then of the Compound; particularly\r\nof those which I had mentioned in the preceding Six Books, and more\r\nespecially the greater and, as it were, celebrated preparations. For I\r\ndid not think it proper to treat of all these articles promiscuously,\r\nlest it should occasion confusion, but so that any person looking for one\r\nor more of the distinguished preparations might easily find it. Towards\r\nthe end are certain things connected with the Composition of Medicines,\r\nand of those articles which may be substituted for one another: the whole\r\nconcluding with an account of Weights and Measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                      PAGE\r\n\r\n  Advertisement                                                          v\r\n\r\n  Translator’s Preface                                                  ix\r\n\r\n  Author’s Preface                                                    xvii\r\n\r\n                             FIRST BOOK.\r\n\r\n  SECT.\r\n\r\n    1.

I.—ON THE COMPLAINTS OF PREGNANT WOMEN, AND THEIR DIET.\r\n\r\nOf the complaints which befal women in a pregnant state, the most\r\ntroublesome are a redundance of crudities, continued vomiting,\r\nsalivation, heartburn, and loathing of food; it will therefore be proper\r\nto give directions regarding them. The most suitable remedies are,\r\nexercise on foot, food not too sweet, wines which are yellow, fragrant,\r\nand about five years old, and moderate drink. All these things are\r\nproper for the cure of crudities and vomiting. For medicines, you may\r\ngive the plant of knot-grass, boiled in water, for drink; and likewise\r\ndill, and the Pontic-root, called Rha, in the dialect of its native\r\ncountry. These things may be taken at a meal, or before it. Externally,\r\nthe flowers of the wild vine, those of the wild or domestic pomegranate,\r\nthe leaves of the alsanders (_smyrnium_), and the seed of the fennel,\r\nmay be mixed together according to pleasure, along with dates and old\r\nwine, and applied to the præcordium in the form of a cataplasm. Heartburn\r\nmay be alleviated by drinking warm water, by gentle exercise on foot,\r\nand by covering the hypochondrium with soft wool. In the case of those\r\nwho have an aversion to food, whet their appetite with a variety of\r\narticles of a savory nature, and also give dry starch. This last is\r\nparticularly serviceable to those who long to eat earth, as is the case\r\nin the complaint called Pica, which occurs most frequently about the\r\nthird month after conception; because the fœtus being then weak, cannot\r\nconsume all the aliment which is brought to the uterus, and hence various\r\nsuperfluities are collected in the stomach; and therefore they have a\r\ndesire for complicated and improper articles, such as extinguished coals,\r\nCimolian earth, and many more such things. On that account, the affection\r\nhas got its appellation, either from the variety of colours which the\r\nbird Pica possesses, or from its being subject to this complaint. Labour\r\nand long journeys will also contribute to restore a desire for wholesome\r\nfood. But she who has accustomed herself to live in an indolent manner,\r\nwill not be able, when she proves with child, to bear exercise all at\r\nonce. To those who loathe food, it may be of service to take acrid\r\nsubstances, and particularly mustard. For swellings of the feet, it may\r\nbe proper to bind over them the herb anthyllis, soaked in vinegar; or to\r\nlay the leaves of a cabbage over them, and to anoint them with Cimolian\r\nearth mixed with vinegar, or with alum and vinegar. It is likewise of\r\nuse to sprinkle the feet with a decoction of the Median apples, called\r\ncitrons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We shall commence by giving a short account of ancient\r\nopinions on a curious subject not touched upon by our author,—we mean, on\r\nthe influence of the imagination in pregnant women on the fœtus.\r\n\r\nHippocrates says, that when pregnant women long to eat coals and\r\nearth, the likeness of these things appears on the head of the child.\r\n(De Superfœt. c. 8.) Galen likewise believed in the influence of the\r\nimagination of pregnant women on the fœtus _in utero_. (Ad Pison.)\r\nSoranus also was a firm believer, and gives instances in women and in the\r\ninferior animals of the force of imagination at the time of impregnation.\r\n(lib. vii.) This belief was very ancient, for it appears to be\r\ncountenanced by the Jewish historian. (See Genesis, xxx, 37-9.) Traces of\r\nthis opinion may be found in Hesiod; and distinct allusion to it is made\r\nin the ‘Cynegetics’ of Oppian. (i, 327.) The story in the ‘Æthiopics’ of\r\nHeliodorus respecting Chariclea, the white daughter of the black king and\r\nqueen of the Æthiopians, bespeaks the prevalence of the belief at the\r\ntime when this celebrated romance was written. Andreas Laurentius gives\r\nan interesting statement of ancient and modern opinions on this subject.\r\n(De Mirab. Strum. Sanit.)\r\n\r\nThe bird _pica_ is mentioned by name (κίττα) in the ‘Aves’ of\r\nAristophanes. (See also Schol. in Aristoph. in Pac. 496, and Vesp. 348;\r\nAristotle, Hist. An. vii, 4; and Pliny, Hist. Nat. x, 41.) Harduin\r\nconcludes, from Pliny’s account of it, that it was the magpie. But we\r\nare rather inclined to follow Schneider in referring it to the jay, or\r\n_corvus glandarius_.\r\n\r\nOn the disease, see Galen (Hyg.; de Causis Sympt. i, 7); Aëtius (xvi,\r\n10); Theophanes Nonnus (c. 213); Moschion (de Morb. Mulier. c. 27);\r\nEros (apud Gynæcia), Alexander Aphrodisiensis (Problem. ii, 73);\r\nPseudo-Dioscorides (Euporist. ii, 16); Soranus (viii); Leo (vi, 14);\r\nRhases (Contin. xi); Avicenna (iii, 21, 2); Haly Abbas (Theor. vi, 17);\r\nSerapion (Tr. iii, 22); Alsaharavius (Pract. xxv, 2, 8.) It appears to be\r\nthe malacia of Pliny (Hist. Nat. xxiii, 56, ed. Hard.)\r\n\r\nMoschion defines the Pica to be an appetite for unusual food, which\r\nhappens to pregnant women at some irregular period; being attended with\r\na collection of depraved humours and nausea. It occurs, he says, most\r\ncommonly in the second month, but sometimes earlier, and sometimes later.\r\nHe recommends a restricted diet at first, then wine, dry astringent food,\r\ncataplasms of a repellent nature, and bodily motion.\r\n\r\nSoranus treats of Pica in very similar terms to those of Moschion.\r\n\r\nBut the account of the disease given by Galen and Aëtius is the fullest.\r\nThey derive the name either from the bird, as mentioned above, or from\r\nivy (κίττος), because, as ivy entwines itself about various plants, so\r\ndoes this appetite in pregnant women fasten upon a variety of improper\r\narticles of food. It is attended with languor of the stomach, nausea,\r\nand loathing of food, bringing on vomiting of bile or phlegm, anxiety,\r\nand pains in the stomach. All these symptoms arise, they say, from a\r\nsanguineous plethora, brought on by a suppression of the menstrual\r\ndischarge. They, therefore, recommend a restricted diet, and moderate\r\nexercise when the woman was accustomed to it. When the humour which\r\ninfests the stomach is of an acid, acrid, or saltish nature, they\r\ndirect draughts of tepid water, to encourage vomiting; they forbid all\r\nsweet things; and recommend an old sub-astringent wine. When there is a\r\nloathing of food, they advise us to tempt the appetite with a variety\r\nof savory things. To those who have a desire for eating earth, they\r\nparticularly recommend starch. When the fluid which is vomited is of a\r\nthick and viscid nature, they recommend pickles, radishes, and oxymel,\r\nfor an emetic. They also particularly direct astringent cataplasms and\r\nplasters to be applied to the præcordia.\r\n\r\nAs the practice of the other authorities is conducted upon similar\r\nprinciples, we shall mention them very succinctly. For the depraved\r\nappetite which longs for earth, Serapion recommends aromatic spices,\r\nsuch as cardamon, cubebs, and the like. For the continued vomiting,\r\nAlsaharavius directs plasters, containing the oil of spikenard, mastich,\r\nquinces, wormwood, and the like, or a vessel filled with hot water, to be\r\napplied over the stomach, pomegranate seeds to be held in the mouth; and\r\nthat the patient should take gentle exercise, and abstain from all sweet\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nAlexander Aphrodisiensis accounts for the disease in much the same way as\r\nGalen and Aëtius. He says that, when the menstrual fluid is suppressed, a\r\ndetermination of it takes place to the stomach, until the fœtus becomes\r\nas large as to consume it.\r\n\r\nPliny strongly commends citrons for the cure of the disease.\r\n\r\nFor the œdematous swellings of the feet and legs, most of the other\r\nauthorities concur with our author in recommending astringent\r\napplications. The anthyllis, mentioned by him, is supposed by Sprengel to\r\nhave been the _cressa cretica_. (R. H. Hist. p. 164.)\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude our commentary on this Section with an outline of\r\nthe directions given by Aspasia for the management of pregnant women.\r\nWomen who have conceived are to be guarded from frights, sorrow, and all\r\nviolent mental perturbation. They are to avoid gestation in carriages,\r\nsevere exercise, inordinate breathing and blows about the loins; also the\r\nlifting of heavy loads, dancing, and sitting on hard seats. Likewise all\r\nacrid and flatulent food, strong clysters, and too much or too little\r\nfood and drink are to be avoided. All discharges of blood, whether from\r\nthe nose or hemorrhoids, are dangerous in the pregnant state. Moderate\r\nand wholesome food, gestation in a sedan, gentle walking, soft friction,\r\nand the exercise of spinning are proper. About the eighth month,\r\nwhich is the most critical period of pregnancy, the diet is to be more\r\ncontracted, and the exercise increased. If the bowels are constipated\r\nowing to compression of the rectum, by the enlarged uterus, laxative\r\nfood is to be given, such as ptisan and mallows. In the ninth month the\r\nregimen is to be of a relaxing nature, and for this purpose the tepid\r\nbath is to be frequently taken, for it has a great effect in rendering\r\nparturition easy. (Apud Aëtium, xvi, 12.)\r\n\r\nOur author borrows part of this chapter from Oribasius, and abridges the\r\nrest from Galen and Aëtius.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.—ON THE NURSE.\r\n\r\nA nurse is to be chosen who is free from every complaint, and is neither\r\nvery old nor very young. She ought not to be less than twenty-five nor\r\nmore than thirty-five. Her chest should be large, as also her breasts,\r\nand her nipples neither contracted nor turned aside. The rest of her body\r\nshould be neither very fat nor very spare. It is of great consequence\r\nto the child that his nurse should have brought forth but a short time\r\nbefore, and that her child had been a male rather than otherwise. She\r\nought to avoid everything of a very desiccative nature, and likewise\r\nsuch as are saltish, acrid, sour, acid, bitter, very heating, or of an\r\noffensive smell: also, such as are strongly fragrant, condiments, and\r\nsuch like acrid substances. Let the nurse also abstain from venery. Let\r\nher work with her hands and shoulders, let her labour at the mill and the\r\nloom, and carry about the child in her arms. This may be done for three\r\nor four months.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 2.)\r\n\r\nAëtius gives somewhat fuller directions. He says, the nurse ought not\r\nto be younger than twenty, nor older than forty; should be free from\r\ndisease, and have breasts neither too small nor too large; for when the\r\nbreasts are too large, they contain more milk than the child can manage:\r\nand part being retained spoils, and proves injurious to the child, and\r\neven affects the health of the nurse; when too small, on the other\r\nhand, they do not contain a sufficient supply of milk. Large nipples, he\r\nremarks, hurt the gums, and impede deglutition; whereas, when too small,\r\nthey cannot be got hold of. The nurse, he says, should be chaste, sober,\r\ncleanly, and cheerful. (iv, 4.)\r\n\r\nThe directions given by the other authorities, are very similar to our\r\nauthor’s. See, in particular, Rhases (ad Mansor. iv, 30); Avicenna\r\n(Cantic.); Averrhoes (in Cant. p. ii, tr. 1.) Avicenna says, the nurse\r\nought to be from twenty-five to thirty-five years old. Averrhoes says,\r\nfrom twenty to thirty.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been a general practice among the Romans, after they\r\nbecame luxurious and effeminate, for the ladies of noblemen to consign\r\nthe care of their infants to wet nurses. Tacitus, in his elegant dialogue\r\n‘de Oratoribus,’ inveighs against this practice. See also a spirited\r\ndeclamation on this subject, by the philosopher, Phavorinus, in the\r\n‘Noctes Atticæ’ of Aulus Gellius. (xii, 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.—ON THE MILK OF THE NURSE.\r\n\r\nThe best milk is that which is moderate in thickness, quantity, colour,\r\nsmell, and taste. It is a proper way to try the quality of the milk, by\r\npouring a little of it upon the nail of the thumb and observing it in\r\nthe sun; for, when upon turning the nail, it neither runs off too slowly\r\nnor too quickly, it is good milk. You may also try it thus: by pouring\r\nsome milk into a glass vessel, and putting some runnet into it, then\r\nsqueezing them together with your fingers, allow it to coagulate, and\r\nobserve whether the cheesy part be less than the serous; for such milk\r\nis unsuitable, and also the opposite kind is of difficult digestion. The\r\nbest kind is that which has a moderate proportion of each.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius (Synops. v, 3), and\r\nAëtius (iv, 3.)\r\n\r\nThe method of trying the quality of the milk here recommended is\r\nmentioned by Aëtius, Barytus (ap. Geopon. xviii, 20), Dioscorides,\r\nAvicenna, Haly Abbas, and Alsaharavius. According to Avicenna, a child\r\nought not to be allowed to take suck oftener than twice or thrice in the\r\nday. See, in particular, Haly Abbas (Pract. i, 21), and Alsaharavius\r\n(Pract. xxx, 3.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IV.—HOW TO CORRECT THE BAD QUALITIES OF MILK.\r\n\r\nThe bad qualities of milk may be thus corrected. If it be too thick, the\r\nphlegm ought to be evacuated by vomits, the most proper of which are\r\nthose of vinegar and honey. It is also proper to extenuate by labour\r\nbefore meals. Also the following substances are proper, namely: wild\r\nmarjoram, hyssop, savoury, shepherd’s needle, thyme, the small radish,\r\nand old pickle with vinegar and honey. But if it be more acrid and\r\nthinner than natural, the nurse ought to be relieved from much labour,\r\nto be fed upon strong soups, and the flesh of swine, and to be allowed\r\nsodden must and sweet wine. If it be in too small quantity, she ought\r\nto get soups and a generous diet, with sweet wine for drink; and her\r\nbreast and nipples should be rubbed. The cupping instrument, if applied,\r\nwill also be of service. That medicines for the formation of milk, are\r\npossessed of some efficacy, I am well aware, and yet I do not recommend\r\nthem in all cases, for they greatly waste the body. They are, the root\r\nand fruit of the fennel boiled in ptisan, the leaves of the cytisus in\r\ndark-coloured wine or ptisan, the sweet gith (_melanthium_), dill, the\r\nroot and fruit of the carrot. They are to be first soaked with warm\r\nwater, and then given. But when the milk is bad, whether it be thick,\r\nacrid, or of a strong smell, it is first to be sucked out and then the\r\nchild is to be applied. For that which is acrid ought, on no account, to\r\nbe given to the infant when hungry; but that which has an offensive smell\r\nmay be corrected by fragrant wine and sweet food. Of coagulated milk in\r\nthe breasts, we will treat in the Third Book.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Aristotle forbids wet nurses to drink wine. It is the same\r\nthing, he adds, whether the nurse or the child drink it. (De Somno.)\r\n\r\nOribasius, Aëtius, and Avicenna give similar directions to our author’s.\r\nThey all permit nurses to take a moderate allowance of animal food and\r\nwine. When the nurse has too little milk, Aëtius recommends her to\r\ndrink ale (Zythus.) He also approves of sweet wine, gruels prepared\r\nwith fennel, or green dill boiled with ptisan. When the milk is thin,\r\nhe directs her to abstain from baths, and to take food of a nutritive\r\nquality, such as fine bread, the legs of swine, tender birds, the flesh\r\nof kids, and sweet wine. When the milk is thick, he recommends frequent\r\nbaths, and an attenuant diet. When it is excessive, he directs her to\r\ndiminish the quantity of the food, and to take what is less nutritive,\r\nand to make discutient applications to the breasts, such as a linen cloth\r\ndipped in vinegar, and to wash them frequently with warm salt water, or\r\nthe decoction of myrtle.\r\n\r\nHippocrates forbids the nurse to take things of an acrid, saltish, acid,\r\nor crude nature. He recommends fennel, cytisus, parsley, and the hot bath\r\nas a general regimen to nurses. (De Mulieb.)\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas gives similar directions. He properly recommends the nurse to\r\nabstain from taking things of a pungent, sour, and bitter nature. When\r\nthe nurse’s milk is deficient, he recommends that she should get the milk\r\nof cows and goats, fennel, lettuce, parsley, and the like. (Pract. i, 21.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. V.—ON THE MANAGEMENT OF THE INFANT.\r\n\r\nThe first food given to a new-born child should be honey, and afterwards\r\nmilk, twice, or at most three times a day. When it appears disposed\r\nfor it, and seems able to digest it, it may get some food, care being\r\ntaken not to stuff it. If this should happen to be the case, it will\r\nbecome more sleepy and inactive, there will be swelling of the belly and\r\nflatulence, and its urine will be more watery than natural. When this is\r\nobserved, it ought to get no more food until what it has got be consumed.\r\nThe child may be brought up upon milk until it be two years old, after\r\nwhich, its diet may be changed to food from grain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 5.)\r\n\r\nGalen, in like manner, approves of the honey. He directs the body of a\r\nnew-born child to be sprinkled with salt; and afterwards rubbed every\r\nday with oil. After the milk-diet is given up, the first food to be\r\nadministered, he says, should be bread, and afterwards pulse and flesh.\r\nHe forbids the use of wine, because the temperament of a child is hot and\r\nhumid. He approves of the hot bath, but condemns the use of the cold for\r\nyoung children. (Hyg. pluries.)\r\n\r\nAëtius recommends the child to be brought up upon milk for twenty months.\r\nMoschion says, from eighteen months to two years will be sufficient.\r\nAvicenna, like our author, mentions two years. It is stated by Selden,\r\nthat the Hebrew women gave suck to their children for two years. This\r\npractice is enjoined in the Koran. Aëtius is not so strict in regard\r\nto regimen as Galen; he allows us to vary the milk-diet, by giving\r\noccasionally soft eggs, mead, or sweet wine diluted with water. (iv, 28.)\r\n\r\nMoschion, Averrhoes, and Avicenna approve of exercising the child in a\r\ncradle, and of lulling him with music. When the cord falls off, Avicenna\r\nadvises that the part should be sprinkled with the powder of burnt lead.\r\n\r\nAverrhoes disapproves of sprinkling the child’s body with salt, as\r\nrecommended by Galen. (Collig. ii, 6.) He agrees with Galen, however, in\r\ncondemning the use of wine. He directs exercise for the child every day;\r\nafter exercise, friction, and after friction, the bath. He forbids the\r\nuse of the cold bath, however, because it retards the growth. When the\r\nchild does not sleep, Avicenna and Averrhoes recommend poppy in his food.\r\n(Cant. ii, 1.)\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas directs us, when there is any malformation of the head,\r\nto reduce it to its proper shape, and bind it firm. Like Galen, he\r\nrecommends that the body of a new-born child should be sprinkled with\r\nsalt and powdered roses, to harden the skin. He directs us to give\r\nthe child, for the first two days, sugar, triturated with the oil of\r\nsesame. He recommends the frequent use of the tepid bath. He properly\r\ndirects the nurse not to expose the child’s eyes to the strong light of\r\nday, nor to allow him to sleep in a strong sun, for fear of injuring\r\nhis eyes. When a child cries, it is the duty of the nurse, he says, to\r\nfind out the cause, as a child never cries except when something hurts\r\nit. The most common causes, he adds, are, heat or cold, fleas or gnats,\r\nhunger or thirst, retention of urine or of the fæces. For retention of\r\nthe urine, he recommends melon-seed with julep both to the child and\r\nthe nurse; and when the child’s bowels are constipated, he directs the\r\nnurse to take laxative herbs, oil of olives, prunes, and so forth. It is\r\nclear, therefore, that he was aware that a child may be operated upon by\r\nmedicines given to the nurse. (Pract. i, 20.)\r\n\r\nThe directions given by Alsaharavius are very similar. He remarks that\r\nviolent crying may occasion a descent of the bowels.\r\n\r\nSyrasis, one of the commentators on Avicenna, recommends the tepid bath\r\nfor young children, and food after it. He directs the nurse to exercise\r\nthe child before putting him into the bath.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have stated, it will be seen that the ancient physicians\r\ndid not approve of the cold regimen, absurdly proposed by certain modern\r\nphilosophers as the most proper for infants.\r\n\r\nAccording to Athenæus, the sons of Roman freemen were prohibited from\r\ndrinking wine until they were thirty years old. (Deipnos, x, 23.) Plato\r\nenjoins complete abstinence from wine until the age of eighteen, and\r\ngreat moderation until thirty. (Leg. ii.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VI.—ON THE ERUPTIONS WHICH HAPPEN TO CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nWhatever eruptions appear upon the skin of a child, are to be encouraged,\r\nin the first place; but when the eruption is properly come out, it may be\r\ncured by putting the child into baths of myrtle, or lentisk, or roses,\r\nand then anointing with the oil of roses or lentisk, or with a cerate\r\ncontaining ceruse. And its body may be gently rubbed with nitre; but it\r\nwill not bear hard friction. But a very good plan is for the nurse to be\r\nfed upon sweetish things. And the child’s diet ought to be attended to,\r\nso that it be neither too full nor too spare. If the child’s belly be\r\nconstipated, a little honey may be put into its food; and if even then it\r\ndo not obey, turpentine, to the size of a chick-pea, may be added. When\r\nthe bowels are loose, millet, in particular, ought to be administered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius (Synops. v, 6.) See also\r\nAëtius (iv, 21.) The Exanthemata here referred to would appear, properly\r\nspeaking, to be the _strophuli_ of Dr. Willan, but the ancients used the\r\nterm rather vaguely for several eruptive diseases. (See Book Fourth.)\r\nThe Exanthemata are the “pustulæ parvæ” of Eros (apud Gynæcia, p. 59.)\r\nFor the Arabians, see in particular Haly Abbas (Pract. i, 20); Avicenna\r\n(i, 3, 1); Alsaharavius (Tr. xxvi, 7 and 8.) Alsaharavius describes two\r\ncutaneous complaints of infancy by the names of _Alseafa_ and _Alkaba_.\r\nThe former he describes as consisting of pustules, which affect the\r\nheads of infants, and sometimes the face. They are attended, he says,\r\nwith a constant itching, and occasion erosion. His treatment is to shave\r\nthe head, and to apply to it first a leaf of blite (_bletæ_ vel _betæ_?)\r\nand afterwards an ointment composed of spuma argenti, ceruse, and lye,\r\nwith rose-oil and wax. The _Alkaba_ is said to be of the same nature,\r\nonly that the fluid which runs from the pustules resembles honey. This,\r\ntherefore, must be the _porrigo favosa_. His remedies are, to wash the\r\nhead frequently with a lotion made from marjoram, mint, or centaury; and\r\nthen to apply an ointment composed of spuma argenti, ceruse, Armenian\r\nbole, sulphur, almonds, and quicksilver; and also liniments of rose-oil\r\nand vinegar, with the free use of the bath. As Dr. Willan remarks, he\r\nhas described the _strophuli_ by the name of pustulæ, (_bothor_.) (Tr.\r\nxxvi, 25.) He says of them: “Aliæ sunt albæ, aliæ rubeæ, aliæ nigræ, aliæ\r\nmagnæ, aliæ parvæ et multæ et paucæ, aliæ fortis et acuti doloris, et\r\nmortiferæ,” &c. It appears, therefore, that he applies the term in a very\r\nlax signification.\r\n\r\nRhases describes the Exanthemata by the name of _vesicæ_. He prescribes,\r\nat the commencement, medicines for expelling the morbific superfluity\r\nfrom the inner parts, such as the decoction of dates or figs, with\r\nfennel water. When the eruption is fairly come out, he recommends baths\r\nmedicated with roses, myrtles, and the like; after which, the child is to\r\nbe rubbed with the oil of roses or of violets. (De Morbis Infant, c. 19.)\r\nWe may mention that Lanfrancus, and the other medical authorities of that\r\nage, describe them by the name of _saphati_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VII.—ON THE COUGH AND DEFLUXION OF INFANTS.\r\n\r\nWhen the child is seized with cough or defluxion, recourse is to be had\r\nto a linctus of honey. It is first to be bathed copiously with warm\r\nwater, even to its head, and plenty of honey given: then press its tongue\r\ngently with your finger, and it will vomit up much phlegm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Oribasius (Synops. v, 7), and Aëtius (iv, 18.) Aëtius\r\nrecommends various lohochs or linctus. One of them consists of pine-nuts,\r\nalmonds, linseed, liquorice-juice, and honey.\r\n\r\nEmetics and demulcents, such as gum arabic and liquorice, are the\r\nremedies recommended by Avicenna, (i, 3, 1.)\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas approves of lohochs, containing almonds, honey, &c. (Pract.\r\ni, 20.) Alsaharavius recommends various demulcents, and an electuary\r\ncontaining poppy-seed, tragacanth, and the seeds of citrons, to be taken\r\nin a decoction of Sebesten plums. He also directs us to produce vomiting,\r\nby making the patient swallow copious draughts of honied water. (Tr.\r\nxxvi, 24.)\r\n\r\nRhases recommends nearly the same remedies. (De Morbis Infant, c. 18.)\r\n\r\nThis would appear to be the most proper place for giving from Aëtius some\r\naccount of two affections of infancy, which our author has omitted to\r\ndescribe. He says, when children have been fed on improper food, or when,\r\nfrom any other cause, their stomachs become loaded with phlegm, they\r\nare troubled with snorting; and in that case he recommends a linctus of\r\nlinseed, honey, &c.; or if the affection be obstinate, to make them vomit\r\nby pressing down the tongue with a finger smeared with oil. (iv, 7.)\r\n\r\nWhen an infant has lost its voice, which, he says, arises commonly from\r\nconstipation, he recommends the juice of cabbage, either by the mouth or\r\nin a _lavement_; or a suppository into the anus. (iv, 8.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VIII.—ON PRURITUS.\r\n\r\nIf the child be troubled with pruritus, use fomentations, and anoint with\r\nplenty of refined oil, in which a little wax has been melted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Galen (Hyg. v); Oribasius (Synops. v, 8); Avicenna (i,\r\n3, 1); Haly Abbas (Pract. i, 20); Rhases (de Morb. Infant, c. 19);\r\nAlsaharavius (Pract. xxvi, 25.)\r\n\r\nThe account given by Oribasius is similar to our author’s. (Synops. v, 8.)\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius properly recommends attention to correct the acrimony of the\r\nnurse’s milk; to wash the child with decoctions of roses, myrtle leaves,\r\nand the like; if the pustules are of a dry nature, to rub them with oil\r\nof sesame or of violets; and, if humid, with an ointment made of wax,\r\nlitharge, and rose-oil.\r\n\r\nRhases directs the nurse to abstain from sweet and salt things, as they\r\ninflame the blood; and to put the child into a bath medicated with\r\nmallows, pearl-barley, fenugreek, gourds, &c.\r\n\r\nAvicenna and Haly Abbas treat the complaint upon similar principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IX.—ON DENTITION.\r\n\r\nDentition commences about the seventh month. At that time inflammations\r\nof the gums, cheeks, and tendons are apt to occur; and sometimes\r\nconvulsions. The child must then get nothing which requires mastication;\r\nand his gums should be rubbed frequently when in the bath with the\r\nfinger, or soothed with the fat of fowls or the brain of a hare. When\r\nthe teeth are just coming through, the neck, jaws, and head should be\r\nwrapped in soft wool, or they may be anointed with warm sweet oil, some\r\nof which ought to be poured into the pores of the ears. The child ought\r\nthen to have a more generous quality of food, and be bathed in warm\r\nwater. If he have diarrhœa, it is proper to bind his belly by epithemes,\r\nnamely, such as are of an astringent nature, as cumin, dill, or parsley,\r\nsprinkled upon wool. It is proper to mix the seeds of roses, and, in\r\nshort, to use hot desiccants. If the bowels are constipated, they may be\r\ngently roused to action by means of a suppository of honey, or the belly\r\nmay be anointed with mint pounded in honey. But the best remedy for the\r\nconvulsions of children, apparently, is to bathe them in water wherein\r\nturnsol (_heliotropium_) has been boiled. It will be of consequence also\r\nto use the oil of privet, of the iris, and the Sicyonian oil; and, in\r\nshort, everything which is of a calefacient nature. But when the teeth\r\nhave come through so as to bite the fingers, it may be proper that he\r\nkeep in his mouth the root of the iris, shaven down and not quite dried.\r\nThis also is of use to ulcers. Butter likewise rubbed in with honey will\r\nbe of service. The flesh of an old pickle relieves pruritus of the gums.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See, in particular, Oribasius (Synops. v, 9), and Aëtius (iv,\r\n9.) Hippocrates and Aëtius recommend a jasper amulet. Hippocrates remarks\r\nthat fevers, pruritus, looseness of the bowels, and convulsions are apt\r\nto come on at the time of dentition, if the child be plethoric, and his\r\nbowels constipated. (Aphoris, cum Comment. Galeni.) Aretæus makes the\r\nsame statement. (Morb. acut. i, 6.)\r\n\r\nMoschion directs the gums of the child to be rubbed, after the fifth\r\nmonth, with sweet oil, the fresh grease of a hen, the brain of a hare,\r\nand lastly with boiled honey. When inflammation supervenes afterwards, he\r\nrecommends fumigations and cataplasms, and directs the food and drink of\r\nthe nurse to be restricted. (c. 119.)\r\n\r\nThe directions given by Avicenna are similar to those of Moschion. (i,\r\n3, 1.) Alsaharavius properly states that the best way to avoid difficult\r\ndentition is to guard against corruption of the food and drink, and to\r\nabstain from emetics, acids, figs, &c. To remove the painful symptoms\r\nattendant on dentition, he directs us to rub the gums with olive oil,\r\nhoney in which aloes and gum arabic have been boiled, and the like; to\r\nwrap the head in soft wool, and to pour tepid water upon it. (Pract.\r\nxxxvi, 19.)\r\n\r\nThe treatment recommended by the other authorities is very similar. See,\r\nin particular, Rhases (Ad Mans. iii, 13.)\r\n\r\nThe only ancient authors who make mention of scarification of the gums\r\nas a remedy for painful dentition are, Marcellus Sideta (Medicina, ex\r\nPiscibus,) and Pliny (Hist. Nat. xxxii, 26.) Both direct it to be done\r\nwith the sting of the _Pastinaca Marina_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. X.—ON APHTHÆ.\r\n\r\nInfants are liable to an ulcer of the mouth called aphtha. It is either\r\nwhitish, reddish, or black, like an eschar. That which is black is of\r\nthe worst kind and most fatal. The iris mixed with honey is of use, or\r\nyou may blow in the dry powder if you please; also, the pounded leaves\r\nof roses, or the flowers of roses, and crocus—a small quantity of myrrh,\r\ngalls, frankincense, or the bark of the frankincense tree: all these\r\ntogether, or separately, may be mixed with honey; and, in addition to\r\nthese, may be joined honied water and the juice of the sweet pomegranate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates mentions aphthæ among the diseases of dentition.\r\n(De Dent.) Theophilus, the commentator on Hippocrates, says, that\r\naphthæ are occasioned by the tenderness of the parts, which cannot\r\nbear the bad qualities of the milk. According to Aretæus, the land of\r\nEgypt is particularly prolific of these ulcers, which are engendered\r\nby the impurities of the water and the quality of the vegetables that\r\ngrow there. (Morb. Acut. i, 9.) The aphthæ appear to be the _oscedo_ of\r\nIsidorus. (Orig. iv, 8.)\r\n\r\nOur author copies from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 10.) See also Aëtius,\r\n(viii, 39.) Aëtius borrows his account from Galen, who is very full upon\r\nthe treatment of aphthæ. He remarks that recent superficial ulcers are\r\neasily cured, but that such as spread and are of a gangrenous nature are\r\nvery dangerous. He gives, at great length, directions for the composition\r\nof applications, suited to every modification of the complaint. When the\r\npustules are red, he prescribes washes of a moderately astringent and\r\ncooling nature; if yellowish, the same, but somewhat more refrigerant; if\r\nwhitish and pituitous, detergents are to be used; and, if black, the most\r\npowerful discutients. For simple cases of the aphthæ infantium, he merely\r\nrecommends the flowers of roses with honied water. Most of his remedies\r\nare astringents. (De Med. sec. Loc. lib. vi.) In another work, he says\r\nthat aphthæ are occasioned by the acrimony of the milk, and are to be\r\ncured by astringents. (Comment. in III Epidem.)\r\n\r\nPliny mentions that the _lapis melititis_ was used as an application in\r\ncases of ulceration of the fauces. (Hist. Nat., xxxvi.) There is reason\r\nto believe that it was Borax, or borate of soda.\r\n\r\nAvicenna recommends at first washes prepared from the vegetable acids,\r\nand afterwards astringents, such as galls, sumach, balaustine, &c. (i, 3,\r\n1.) See also Haly Abbas (Pract. i, 20.)\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius states that aphthæ commonly arise from the sharpness of the\r\nmilk. His general treatment consists in regulating the diet of the nurse,\r\nand using washes principally of an astringent nature for the child’s\r\nmouth. When they are very painful, he adds to the washes the juice of\r\nlettuce, endive, and the like. When they are whitish, he recommends a\r\npowder consisting of myrtle, saffron, and sugar. (Tr. xxvi, 20.) Rhases’\r\ntreatment is quite similar. (De Morbis Infantium, c. 14.)\r\n\r\nThe author of the following work, which has been falsely ascribed to\r\nDioscorides, recommends certain applications of a strongly escharotic\r\nnature, such as this: Of arsenic, p. i; of burnt paper, p. iii; or this,\r\nof sandarach and rose-oil equal parts. (Euporist. i, 82.)\r\n\r\nPsellus enumerates two kinds of aphthæ, namely, the white and the red;\r\nthe former, he says, is mild, the latter very dangerous. (Poëma Medicum.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XI.—ON EXCORIATIONS OF THE THIGHS.\r\n\r\nExcoriations of the thighs may be sprinkled with dried myrtle, cyperus,\r\nand roses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See, in particular, Oribasius (Synops. v, 11); Aëtius (iv,\r\n24); and Avicenna (i, 3, 1.) All recommend nearly the same astringent\r\napplications for the intertrigo of infants.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XII.—ON WATERY DISCHARGES FROM THE EARS.\r\n\r\nWatery discharges from the ears may be dried up by applying to them wool\r\nwith alum, or with wine and honey, or by an injection of old wine either\r\nalone or mixed with saffron.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Oribasius, Aëtius, Avicenna, and Haly Abbas recommend\r\nthe same treatment, which would seem to be very proper. Alsaharavius\r\nrecommends wool soaked in a solution of alum, and injections, consisting\r\nof solutions of nitre (soda) in vinegar. Rhases makes mention of nearly\r\nthe same applications. (De Morb. Infant. c. 9.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XIII.—ON SIRIASIS.\r\n\r\nSiriasis is an inflammation of the parts about the brain and its\r\nmembranes. A hollowness of the open of the head and eyes attend it, with\r\npaleness and dryness of the body. It is relieved by an application of the\r\nred of an egg with oil of roses to the open of the head, in the form of a\r\ncompress, and frequently changed.\r\n\r\n_Another application for Siriasis._ Place upon the open of the head, the\r\nleaves of that species of heliotropium called scorpiurus, the parings of\r\na gourd, the membrane which envelopes the fleshy part of a ripe cucumber,\r\nthe juice of the garden nightshade, with oil of roses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Oribasius (Synops. v, 13); Aëtius (iv, 13); Avicenna (i,\r\n3, 1); Haly Abbas (Pract. i, 20); Alsaharavius (Pract. xxvi, 9); Rhases\r\n(de Morb. Infant. c. 5); Pseudo-Dioscorides (Euporist. i, 9); Alexander\r\nAphrodisiensis (Problem i, 98); Pliny (Hist. Nat. xxxii, 48.)\r\n\r\nAëtius and Avicenna agree in describing it as an inflammation and\r\nswelling of the brain and its membranes, so as to occasion a hollow at\r\nthe bregma, and as being attended with ardent fever. The account given\r\nby the others is very similar. All recommend cooling and astringent\r\napplications to the part. According to Alexander Aphrodisiensis, children\r\nare most subject to this affection, especially in the summer season;\r\nfor which he attempts to assign the reason. He describes it as an\r\ninflammation of the membranes of the brain. The author of the ‘Euporista’\r\nrecommends the juices of various cooling herbs, as local applications.\r\nPliny represents the heat of it as excessive. He says, “Siriasesque\r\ninfantium spongia frigida crebro liumefectata, rana inversa adalligata\r\nefficacissime sanet, quam aridam inveniri affirmant.” (l. c.)\r\n\r\nAlthough somewhat out of place, we shall venture to introduce here some\r\naccount of two diseases of infancy which are omitted by our author, but\r\nare briefly described by Aëtius and Rhases.\r\n\r\nFor prolapsus ani, Aëtius recommends various applications in the form of\r\npowder and fomentation; but states, that what he himself constantly made\r\nuse of was tepid brine or salt water. (iv, 19.) See Rhases (de Morb. Inf.\r\nc. 21.)\r\n\r\nUmbilical hernia, he says, may be occasioned by crying, a blow, or a\r\nfall. For this he recommends various astringent preparations from alum,\r\ngalls, &c., applied on a linen compress to the navel. (iv, 20.) Rhases\r\nrecommends similar applications, and also a compress with the gluten of\r\nhides to be bound over the navel. (De Morb. Infant. c. 22.) As far as\r\nwe can recollect, Hippocrates and his commentators are the only ancient\r\nauthorities that make mention of inflammation of the navel after the cord\r\nhas dropped off. (Aphor. c. Comment. ed. Dietz, p. 374.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XIV.—THE REGIMEN OF INFANCY, AND OF THE SUCCEEDING AGES UNTIL\r\nMANHOOD.\r\n\r\nInfants and children when weaned from milk, are to be allowed to live\r\nmerrily and without restraint; their food ought to be light, and their\r\nexercise gentle. After six or seven years of age, both boys and girls\r\nare to be consigned over to schoolmasters of a mild and benevolent\r\ndisposition; as such persons will impart instruction to them in a\r\ncheerful manner, and without constraint; for relaxation of the mind\r\ncontributes much to the growth of the body. Boys twelve years of age\r\nshould go to teachers of grammar and geometry, and get their bodies\r\nhardened by gymnastic exercises. From fourteen to twenty-one, their\r\nproper employment will be the study of mathematics and initiation in\r\nphilosophy. At the same time, however, it will be proper to use more\r\nexercise for strengthening the body, so that, exercising both mind and\r\nbody, they may be prevented from indulging their carnal desires. They\r\nought likewise to be restricted as to wine. To adults the fullest supply\r\nof nourishment, both as to body and mind, ought to be allowed; wherefore,\r\nthey should use all kinds of gymnastic exercises, particularly such as\r\neach has been accustomed to, and food which is sufficient and nutritious.\r\nIn the decline of life, both the bodily and mental supply ought to be\r\nabridged; and the gymnastic exercises diminished in proportion. The food\r\nalso is to be gradually lessened as the habit begins to contract the\r\nfrigidity of age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. These simple but judicious directions respecting the regimen\r\nof the different periods of life are taken from Oribasius (Synops. v,\r\n14); or from Aëtius (iv, 29.) Many of them are borrowed originally from\r\nGalen. (Hyg. i.)\r\n\r\nSimilar directions are given at great length by Haly Abbas. He positively\r\nprohibits children from taking wine. He insists that wine not only proves\r\nprejudicial to health, but also deteriorates the morals. (Pract. i, 22.)\r\nAlsaharavius agrees with him in proscribing wine to children. (Theor.\r\nxiii, 2.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna makes very judicious observations on this subject, but the\r\ngreater part of them are taken from Galen. He insists, with becoming\r\nearnestness, on the propriety of attending to the regulation of the\r\npassions of the child, as being conducive to his health as well as to\r\nhis morals. As soon as the boy is roused from sleep he is to be bathed;\r\nthen he is to be allowed to play for an hour; afterwards, he is to have\r\nsomething to eat, and then is to be allowed more play. Afterwards he\r\nis to be bathed; then he is to take food; and, if possible, he is to\r\nbe prevented from drinking water immediately after a meal, as it has a\r\ntendency to make unconcocted chyle be distributed over the body. When six\r\nyears old, he is to be consigned to the care of a teacher, but he is not\r\nto be compelled to remain constantly in school. Avicenna goes on to state\r\nthat, at the age he has then reached, he is to be more sparingly bathed,\r\nand that his exercise is to be multiplied before eating. Like most of the\r\nancient authorities, he forbids wine to a child. Thus, he adds, is the\r\nregimen of the child to be regulated until he reach the age of fourteen.\r\n(I, i, 4.)\r\n\r\nAverrhoes gives very sensible directions on this subject. He forbids the\r\nuse of wine and ales until manhood. (Collig. vi, 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XV.—ON THE PREPARATORY FRICTION.\r\n\r\nBefore gymnastic exercises, the body ought to be rubbed moderately first\r\nwith towels, and then with oil in the hollows of the naked hands, until\r\nit be properly warmed and softened, and its surface have contracted a\r\nflorid blush, and become distended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. A more circumstantial account of the mode of preparing the\r\nbody for gymnastic exercises is given by Oribasius. (Med. Collect. vi,\r\n13.) It is taken, however, from Galen’s second book of ‘Hygiene.’ See a\r\nsimilar account in Aëtius (iii, 1), and Avicenna (i, 3, 2.) The object\r\nof it, according to Alexander Aphrodisiensis, was to soften the parts so\r\nthat they might not be ruptured. (Prob. i, 119.) To rub the body with\r\noil was a general practice of the ancients before strong exercises of\r\nevery kind. Hence Horace characterizes an inactive person by his dread\r\nof oil, “Cur olivum Sanguine viperino cautius vitat?”—that is to say, as\r\nhis commentator Acron explains it, “Cur vitat olivum, id est oleum, quo\r\nunctus tutius natet et luctetur?” The poet alludes to the practice in\r\nanother place: “Ter uncti Transnanto Tiberim.” It appears from Martial\r\nthat a composition of oil and wax, called _ceroma_, was sometimes used\r\nfor this purpose:\r\n\r\n    “Vara nec injecto ceromate brachia tendis.”\r\n\r\n                              (Epigr. vii, 32.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Thucydides, the Lacedemonians were the first who rubbed\r\ntheir bodies with oil before wrestling. (i, 1.) Pliny mentions the use of\r\noil before the gymnastic exercises as a luxury introduced by the Greeks.\r\nIt appears from him that cheap aromatics were sometimes added to the oil.\r\nHe further relates that some barbarous nations used butter instead of\r\noil. (Hist. Nat. xi, 41.)\r\n\r\nAthenæus mentions that Antiochus Epiphanes supplied the wrestlers at\r\nDaphne with oil of saffron, of marjoram, and the like. (Deipn. v.)\r\n\r\nLucian makes Solon say to Anacharsis, that oil produces the same effect\r\nupon the living body as upon leather, softening it, and rendering it\r\nstronger and less apt to break. (Anacharsis.)\r\n\r\nThe poets describe Venus as preparing herself for exercise by being\r\nrubbed with fragrant ointments, whereas Minerva disdained to use anything\r\nbut common oil. See Callimachus (Lav. Pall.) and Sophocles (ap. Athen.\r\nDeipnos. xv, 35.)\r\n\r\nThe Roman emperors, and other luxurious persons, often made use of\r\nperfumed ointments instead of oil. See Suetonius (in Vita Caligulæ),\r\nLampridius (in Vita Heliogabali.) It would appear that under the empire\r\nthe people of Rome were supplied gratuitously with oil in their public\r\nbaths. (Lamp. c. 24, and Burman, de V. R. c. iii.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XVI.—ON EXERCISES.\r\n\r\nExercise is a violent motion. The limit to its violence should be a\r\nhurried respiration. Exercise renders the organs of the body hardy\r\nand fit for their functional actions. It makes the absorption of food\r\nstronger, and expedites its assimilation; and it improves nutrition by\r\nincreasing heat. It also clears the pores of the skin, and evacuates\r\nsuperfluities by the strong movement of the lungs. Since, therefore, it\r\ncontributes to distribution, care ought to be taken that neither the\r\nstomach nor bowels be loaded with crude and indigestible food or liquids;\r\nfor there is a danger lest they should be carried to all parts of the\r\nbody before they are properly digested. It is clear then that exercise\r\nought to be taken before eating. The colour of the urine will point out\r\nthe proper time for exercise. When it is watery, it indicates that the\r\nchyme absorbed from the stomach is still undigested. When it is of a deep\r\nyellow colour, and bilious, it shows that digestion had been long ago\r\naccomplished. When it is moderately pale, it indicates that digestion has\r\njust taken place; and this is the proper time for exercise, after having\r\nevacuated whatever excrementitious matters are collected in the bladder\r\nand bowels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The remarks of our author on the effects of exercise are\r\nexceedingly pertinent and comprehensive. See, in like manner, Aëtius\r\n(iii, 2), and Oribasius (Med. Collect. vi, 11.) But Galen is the\r\ngreat authority on this subject, which he treats of very fully and\r\nphilosophically, in the second book of his ‘Hygiene.’ He agrees entirely\r\nwith Hippocrates, that the proper time for exercise is before a meal,\r\nbecause, the excrementitious superfluities being thereby evacuated, the\r\nbody is in a fit condition for receiving a new supply. He explains,\r\nhowever, afterwards, that it is after the digestion and distribution of a\r\npreceding meal have been accomplished that exercise will be most proper.\r\n\r\nAccording to Haly Abbas, exercise is useful for three purposes: 1. For\r\nrousing the innate or natural heat, whereby the processes of digestion\r\nand distribution are accelerated. 2. For opening the pores of the body,\r\nand evacuating its superfluities. 3. For strengthening and rousing the\r\nanimal actions, by the friction it occasions. (Theor. v, 2.) Avicenna\r\ngives nearly the same statement of the good effects of exercise. Haly\r\nAbbas forbids exercise immediately after dinner. He adds, that exercise\r\ntaken immediately after a meal makes the food descend to the intestines,\r\nwhere it is absorbed by the veins before it is properly concocted, and\r\nthereby the liver becomes loaded with crudities. (Pract. i, 3.)\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius recommends exercise before a meal, but advises it not to be\r\ncontinued after one feels fatigued and languid. (Theor. ii, 2.) The same\r\nrule is distinctly laid down by Rhases. (Contin. xxxiii.)\r\n\r\nIt appears that, instead of taking exercise after food, the ancients\r\nwere in the practice of indulging in a short sleep after their dinner or\r\nmid-day meal. See Plautus (Mostell. ac. iii, sc. 2, 1. 8), and the note\r\nof Meursius (Ed. Gronov.) Homer says that it is beneficial to old men to\r\nindulge in sleep after the bath and taking food. (Galen. Hyg. 1.)\r\n\r\nPlutarch mentions that Cicero was cured of debility of the stomach by\r\ntaking moderate exercises. (In vita Cicer.)\r\n\r\nIt was one of the extravagant opinions of Erasistratus, that exercise is\r\nnot at all necessary for the health of the animal frame.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XVII.—ON THE KINDS OF EXERCISE.\r\n\r\nThe common effect of all kinds of exercise is to produce an increase of\r\nthe natural heat of animals. But each species has something peculiar to\r\nit. Strong, that is to say, violent exercise gives vigour to the muscles\r\nand nerves: such are digging, and lifting a very heavy burden, while\r\none remains in the same spot, or moves about; or lifting small weights\r\nand walking about as much as one can. Of this kind, is the exercise\r\nof scaling a rope, and many others of a like kind. The swift kinds of\r\nexercise are such as do not require strength and violence, namely,\r\nrunning, fighting with one’s shadow, wrestling with the extremities of\r\nthe hands, the exercise with the leather bag, and that with the small\r\nBall. This last is compounded of intension and velocity; and such\r\nexercises as are intense may become violent by adding velocity to them.\r\nBesides, some kinds of exercise bring the loins into action, and some the\r\nhands or legs; others the spine or the chest alone, or the lungs. And\r\nexercise ought to be carried on until the body becomes distended, and the\r\nskin of a florid hue; and until then, the motions ought to be strong,\r\nequable, and spirited, upon which you may see warm sweat, mixed with\r\nvapour, break out. It will then be time for you to stop, when any of the\r\nsymptoms which I have mentioned have undergone a change, namely, when the\r\nbulk of the body becomes contracted, or when the florid colour of the\r\nskin declines. And, should any of the motions remit, it will then be time\r\nto stop immediately; or, if there should be any change in the quantity or\r\nquality of the perspiration; for if it should become smaller in quantity,\r\nor colder, we must desist, and, besmearing the body with oil, endeavour\r\nto restore it. It will then be proper to use the Restorative friction, as\r\nthe masters of gymnastics are wont to practise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We shall now give a brief account of the ancient exercises,\r\nsome of which are altogether omitted by our author.\r\n\r\nThe σκιομαχία is thus explained by Cornarius: “Porro σκιομαχίαν accipio\r\numbratilem pugnam, quâ quis privatim domi aut sub umbra, non in propatulo\r\nse exercet, ac veluti præparat ad justam pugnam publicè faciendam.” (Notæ\r\nin Paul. Ægin. h. 1.) This account, however, does not agree with that of\r\nOribasius, who describes it as a mock encounter at boxing and jumping\r\nwith one’s own shadow. (Med. Collect. vi, 29.) It is thus described in\r\nthe Latin translation of Avicenna: “Et ex eis est, insequi umbram suam,\r\nut ipsam percutiat in capite, et manus ad invicem percutere.” (i, 3, 2,\r\n2.) It is mentioned in this sense by Plato (de Legibus, vii), by Plutarch\r\n(Probl. Conviv. vii), and by Achilles Tatius (p. 115.) Juvenal probably\r\nalludes to this sport. (Sat. vi, 246.) We have therefore translated it,\r\n“fighting with one’s own shadow.”\r\n\r\nThe ἀκροχειρισμὸς is thus described by Scaliger: “Est autem ἀκροχειρίζειν\r\nluctæ pars, cum primoribus tantum digitis insertis roboris faciunt\r\npericulum.” (Poet. i, 22.) Suidas explains it thus: “A man taking hold\r\nof his antagonist’s fingers, strove to break them, and did not give over\r\nuntil he compelled him to yield.” The term occurs in Aristotle. (Eth.\r\nNicom. iii, 1.) See also, Athenæus. (Deipnos. iv, 13.) It is called\r\nἀκροχέιρισις by Hippocrates (De Diæta. ii, 42), who says it reduces the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe exercise with the κώρυκος, or leather bag, is described by Oribasius\r\nin the following manner: A bag filled with flour or sand was suspended\r\nfrom the top of the house, on a level with the navel; it was then\r\npushed forwards with the hands to the extremity of the rope, and, as it\r\nrecoiled, the person performing the exercise retreated backwards, so as\r\nto escape from it. (Med. Collect. vi, 33.) This exercise is mentioned by\r\nHippocrates. (De Diæta, ii.) Cornarius and the translator of Hippocrates\r\nconfound it with the _follis_ of the Romans; but Mercurialis clearly\r\nshows that they were quite different. The _follis_ was a leather ball,\r\ninflated with air; such is the description of it by Cælius Aurelianus:\r\n“Follis erat pila magna ex aluta confecta, soloque vento repleta.”\r\nMartial represents it as a becoming exercise for boys or old men:\r\n\r\n    “Ite procul juvenes, mitis mihi convenit ætas,\r\n      Folle decet pueros ludere, folle senes.”\r\n\r\n                                  (Epigr. xiv, 45.)\r\n\r\nThey were different from the _pila magna_ and _parva_; that is to say,\r\nthe large and small ball. These balls were of different sizes, and were\r\nplayed with in various ways. They are minutely described by Oribasius.\r\n(Med. Collect. vi, 32.) See also Horace (Sat. ii, 2), and Martial (Epigr.\r\niv, 15.) See a most learned and accurate account of all these sports in\r\nMercurialis. (De Arte Gymnastica, ii, 4.) Galen has written a treatise on\r\nthe exercise of the parva pila. To this class of exercises we may refer\r\n_the pitching of a stone_, which is mentioned by Avicenna.\r\n\r\nOur author has neglected to make mention of the _halteres_ in this place,\r\nbut recommends the exercise for the cure of elephantiasis. (iv, 1.) It\r\nis described by Galen, who says, it can be made to exercise the spine\r\ntransversely. (De Sanit. tuend. ii, 11.) The exercise with them is thus\r\ndescribed by Potter: “The exercise of leaping they sometimes performed\r\nwith weights upon their heads or shoulders, sometimes carrying them in\r\ntheir hands; these were called ἁλτῆρες, which, though now and then of\r\ndifferent figures, yet, as Pausanias reports, were usually of an oval\r\nform, and made with holes, or else covered with thongs, through which\r\nthe contenders put their fingers.” (Antiquities of Greece, c. 20.)\r\nMercurialis describes them as masses or weights of different materials,\r\nand of such a size as that they could be held in the hands. Ropes, too,\r\nhe adds, were often fastened to them, to hold with. (De Arte Gymnast. ii,\r\n12.) The Pythagoreans were fond of this exercise. (Iamblichus de Vita\r\nPythagoræ, c. 21.)\r\n\r\nThe _funambulatio_ consisted merely in scaling ropes, which, as we may\r\nsuppose, was done in various ways. See Mercurialis (iii, 5), and Baccius\r\n(de Thermis, viii, 7.)\r\n\r\nThe ἐκπλεθρίζειν, as Galen and Avicenna explain, consisted in running\r\nround the plethrum, or sixth part of the stadium, and always contracting\r\nthe circle of one’s course, until one stopt in the middle. The\r\nπιτυλίζειν, as the same authors explain, consisted in walking upon one’s\r\ntoes, and tossing one’s hands backwards and forwards.\r\n\r\nThe _cricilasia_ appears to have been a large hoop, or circle, which\r\nwas rolled on the ground. Even Mercurialis admits the obscurity of\r\nOribasius’s description of it. (Med. Collect. vi, 26.)\r\n\r\nThe _petaurum_ was a seat suspended by ropes, in which seat the person\r\ntaking the exercise sat, and was tossed about by assistants. It is\r\nmentioned by Juvenal (Sat. xiv), and Martial (Epigr. xi, 22.)\r\n\r\nAntyllus thus describes the effects of _equitation_ on the human frame:\r\n“It strengthens the body, especially the stomach, more than any other\r\nmode of exercise; it clears the organs of the senses, and renders them\r\nmore acute; but it is most inimical to the thorax.” Oribasius (Med.\r\nCollect. vi, 24), Pliny (Hist. Nat. xxviii, 4), and Aëtius agree with\r\nAntyllus as to the good effects of equitation on the stomach. Hippocrates\r\nand Cælius Aurelianus state that equitation is hurtful in disease of the\r\nhip-joint. All agree that riding on horseback is hurtful in diseases of\r\nthe chest.\r\n\r\nOf ἀιώρα, or _gestation_, there were various modes. That in a carriage\r\nwas very ancient, and is often mentioned by the medical authors. It\r\nappears from Pliny (Hist. Nat. xvi, 42), that carriages were generally\r\nmade of fir, and that the axles were of ilex, mountain ash, or elm.\r\nSometimes, however, the whole chariot was adorned with gold and silver.\r\n(Pliny, Hist. Nat. xxiv, 17.) They appear to have been often covered in\r\nwith skins. (Plutarch, Prob. Roman.) They were generally drawn by horses\r\nor mules, sometimes by oxen, and occasionally by slaves. They were so\r\nconstructed that a person could either sit or lie, according to pleasure.\r\n(Galen, Hyg.) At first, according to Pliny, they had only two wheels;\r\nthe Phrygians, he says, added two more; and Hippocrates mentions that\r\nthe Scythians introduced the use of six-wheeled carriages. The sedan and\r\nchair are often mentioned by the Latin poets, as well as by the medical\r\nwriters. It is sufficient for our purpose to state that they were so\r\nconstructed, that one could either sit or lie in them. They sometimes\r\nhad windows, formed from the lapis specularis. (Juvenal, Sat. iv, 21.)\r\nNavigation, or sailing in ships and boats, is often mentioned by ancient\r\nauthors as a remedial measure. It was practised on the sea or in rivers.\r\nAccording to Aëtius, gestation in general ventilates the natural heat,\r\nproduces excitement, dispels collected humours, strengthens the frame,\r\nand rouses the actions when in an indolent state. (iii, 6.) Celsus has an\r\ninteresting chapter on gestation. The following rule for the application\r\nof it is very judicious: “Gestatio quoque longis et jam inclinatis\r\nmorbis aptissima est; utilisque est et iis corporibus quæ jam ex toto\r\nfebre carent, sed adhuc exerceri per se non possunt; et iis quibus lentæ\r\nmorborum reliquiæ remanent, neque aliter eliduntur.” Upon the whole, he\r\nholds it to be a doubtful practice in ardent fever, although sanctioned\r\nby the authority of Asclepiades Bithynus: at all events, he insists that\r\ngestation is improper when there is any local pain or swelling. After\r\ncharacterizing the different modes of gestation, he remarks respecting\r\nthem: “Levia quidem genera exercitationis infirmis conveniunt: valentiora\r\nvero iis qui jam pluribus diebus febre liberati sunt; aut iis, qui\r\ngravium morborum initia sic sentiunt, ut adhuc febre vacent, quod et in\r\ntabe, et in stomachi vitiis, et cum aqua cutem subiit, et interdum in\r\nregio morbo fit; aut ubi quidam morbi, qualis comitialis, qualis insania\r\nest, sine febre, quamvis diu, manent.” (ii, 15.)\r\n\r\nGalen eulogises _hunting_ as being an excellent exercise to the body,\r\nand an agreeable recreation to the mind. He says, that by the mental\r\nexcitement which it produces, many have been cured of dangerous diseases.\r\n(De parva Pila.) Rhases mentions, that during the prevalence of a certain\r\npestilential epidemic, it was observed, that huntsmen were the only class\r\nof people who escaped its contagion. (Contin. iii.) The ancients have\r\ntransmitted to us many elegant treatises, both in prose and in verse,\r\non this delightful recreation. Those of Xenophon, Oppian, Gratius, and\r\nNemesianus will be found particularly interesting. The younger Pliny\r\nattributes his recovery from a certain complaint, to the exercise of\r\nhunting. (Epist. v, 6.)\r\n\r\nThe occupation of _fishing_, according to Plato, produces neither mental\r\nnor bodily excitement. (In Sophista.) Galen and Avicenna briefly mention\r\nit as an exercise which may tend to the preservation of health; but\r\nneither of them appears to have attached much importance to it. The poet\r\nOppian, however, in his ‘Halieutica’ has celebrated the pleasures and\r\ndangers of fishing, with all the enthusiasm of an Isaac Walton, or a\r\nWashington Irving.\r\n\r\nOribasius states that _swimming_ tends to warm, strengthen, and attenuate\r\nthe body. He says that swimming in the sea is particularly applicable in\r\ncases of dropsy, eruptive diseases of the skin, and elephantiasis. It\r\nis apt, however, he adds, to prove injurious to the head, and also to\r\nthe nerves when too long continued. We have mentioned in the fifteenth\r\nSection, that the ancients got their bodies rubbed with oil before going\r\ninto the water. Celsus gives nearly the same account of it, as a remedy\r\nfor the cure of diseases, as Oribasius. Swimming may be said to have\r\nbeen the national exercise of the ancient Romans. Horace in particular\r\nmakes frequent allusions to it as an invigorating and manly exercise. The\r\nRomans had artificial lakes or ponds connected with their baths, for the\r\npurpose of swimming. (Pliny, Epist. v, 6.)\r\n\r\n_Jumping_ and _dancing_, according to Oribasius, occasion a determination\r\ndownwards, and hence, they may prove useful in cases of amenorrhœa. (Med.\r\nCollect. vi, 31.) It appears from a case related in a work attributed\r\nto Hippocrates, that jumping was had recourse to, to procure abortion.\r\n(De nat. Pueri.) The most eloquent encomiast of dancing is Lucian, who\r\nhas written an ingenious treatise in praise of it. He contends that it\r\nis an excellent training, not only to the body, but also to the mind! He\r\nrefers to Socrates and other sage philosophers who practised dancing.\r\n(De Saltatione.) The Pyrrhic dance of the ancients was particularly\r\ncelebrated. It was performed by armed men. See Vossius (de Nat. Art. i,)\r\nand Athenæus (Deipn. xiv, 19, ed. Schweigh.)\r\n\r\nOn the Apotherapia or Restorative process, see Galen (Hyg. iii);\r\nOribasius (Med. Collect. vi, 16); and Avicenna (i, 3, 2.) It consisted\r\nsimply in rubbing the body softly and moderately with oil. According\r\nto Galen, the object of it was to relieve the feelings of lassitude,\r\nand prevent any bad effects from the exercise. Mercurialis states that,\r\nwhen applied after the bath, it was with the intention of preventing the\r\nhumidity from being dissipated. Odoriferous ointments and powders were\r\nsometimes used instead of the oil. (De Arte gymnast. i; also Baccius de\r\nThermis, 10.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XVIII.—ON THE KINDS OF FRICTION.\r\n\r\nHard friction contracts, and soft relaxes; so that those persons that\r\nare relaxed should be rubbed hard, and those that are immoderately\r\nconstricted, softly; and when, neither in the one state nor the other,\r\nit is clear that neither the one mode of friction nor the other should\r\nbe had recourse to, but as much as possible either extreme ought to\r\nbe avoided. For much and hard friction diminishes the bulk of the\r\nbody, whilst, on the other hand, little and soft distends it. If the\r\nthree different kinds of frictions as to quantity be joined to the\r\nsame number as to quality, they will produce nine combinations, as is\r\nstated below. For one of the kinds, as to quantity, for example _much_,\r\nbeing complicated with the three differences as to quality, I mean the\r\n_hard_, the _soft_, and the _moderate_ as to hardness, will produce\r\nthree combinations; and, again, the _little_ being joined to the other\r\nthree will produce three more; and the _moderate_ as to quality being\r\ncomplicated with the same three, will produce three more, as is shown\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n    QUANTITY.        QUALITY.\r\n\r\n    Much     }     { Hard.\r\n    Much     } and { Soft.\r\n    Much     }     { Moderate.\r\n\r\n    Little   }     { Hard.\r\n    Little   } and { Soft.\r\n    Little   }     { Moderate.\r\n\r\n    Moderate }     { Hard.\r\n    Moderate } and { Soft.\r\n    Moderate }     { Moderate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The brief but comprehensive rules of Hippocrates for the\r\napplication of friction, are thus given in the language of Celsus:\r\n“Hippocrates dixit, frictione, si vehemens sit, durari corpus; si lenis,\r\nmolliri; si multa, minui; si modica, impleri.” Celsus adds, that,\r\naccording to circumstances, the body may be braced by it, if relaxed; may\r\nbe softened, if indurated; may have its superfluities expelled, if loaded\r\nwith plethora; and have nourishment attracted to it, if emaciated. He\r\nremarks, that it is mostly applicable in the decline of a disease. His\r\nother directions for the application of it are very apposite, (ii, 14.)\r\n\r\nPliny delivers the rules of Hippocrates in nearly the same words as\r\nCelsus. (Hist. Nat. xxviii, 14.)\r\n\r\nOur author’s account of friction is taken from Oribasius (Med. Collect.\r\nvi), or from Aëtius (iii.) All, however, are indebted to Galen, who\r\nhandles the subject most scientifically. (Hyg. ii.)\r\n\r\nSimilar directions are given by Avicenna (i, 3, 2), and by Haly Abbas\r\n(Theor. v, 12.) Averrhoes gives the sum of the directions laid down by\r\nGalen and the other authorities. Strong friction, he says, braces and\r\nhardens the body; weak, rarifies and softens; moderate, operates in an\r\nintermediate degree. Besides, he adds, hard friction diminishes obesity;\r\nmoderate, on the other hand, tends to remove emaciation. (Collect. ii, 3.)\r\n\r\nIt was a general practice of the ancients to have recourse to friction\r\nin the morning and evening. Oribasius has many excellent observations on\r\nthis practice. (l. c.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XIX.—ON VOCIFERATION, OR THE EXERCISE OF THE VOICE.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of the voice, regular and gentle modulation can\r\ncontribute nothing to health, but the utterance of louder tones is\r\nbeneficial, and is therefore to be practised. For, much air being\r\ninhaled thus by respiration expands the chest and stomach, and dilates\r\nand extends all the pores of the body. Wherefore, even in reading, it\r\npromotes the excretion of redundant humours, to those who read in a\r\nhigh tone, by inducing sweats; while in those who read with a moderate\r\ntone it promotes the insensible perspiration over the whole frame. For\r\nby attenuating the excrementitious matters which are hawked up, the\r\nsaliva, mucus, and phlegm are discharged and consumed. And to those who\r\nstand in need of warming, on account of their frigidity, what mode of\r\nrelief can be more proper than the action of respiration? Such persons\r\nought therefore to read frequently, and, relaxing the whole body, so as\r\nto distend the windpipe and all the other passages of air, endeavour\r\nto utter the loudest sounds. And yet we must not have recourse to the\r\nexercise of the voice rashly, and without consideration, nor when the\r\nsystem is filled with depraved humours, or the stomach loaded with\r\ncrudities, lest noxious vapours be thereby distributed over the whole\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. These remarks of our author are very pertinent; But Oribasius\r\nhas given a more comprehensive view of the subject, from the works of\r\nAntyllus. He thus describes the mode of performing vociferation: The\r\nbowels being evacuated, the person’s body is to be first rubbed, and then\r\nthe inferior parts and the face are to be sponged with water. He is to\r\nbegin talking, at first, in a moderate tone, while at the same time he\r\nwalks about, and afterwards, straining his voice to a louder tone, he is\r\nto repeat certain verses. (Med. Collect. vi.)\r\n\r\nPlutarch gives nearly the same account of it. He commends vociferation\r\nas giving strength to the internal parts, increasing the vital heat,\r\npurifying the veins, attenuating the blood, and dispelling the humours.\r\nHe cautions, however, not to strain the voice to too great a pitch, lest\r\nit occasion rupture of any of the vessels. (De Sanit. tuendâ.)\r\n\r\nVociferation, according to Aëtius, is an exercise of the chest and the\r\norgans of speech, improving the vital heat; attenuating and strengthening\r\nthe solid parts of the body. He recommends it for the cure of asthma,\r\northopnœa, phthisical and chronic pains of the chest, or apostemes when\r\nthey burst; also, in tertian intermittents, and affections of the stomach\r\nattended with vomiting. It is unsuitable, he says, in complaints of the\r\nhead. (iii, 5.)\r\n\r\nCelsus recommends loud reading for curing weakness of the stomach. (i, 8.)\r\n\r\nGalen scarcely takes any notice of vociferation, except that, in one\r\nplace, he states that it exercises the chest and lungs. (De Sanit.\r\ntuendâ, ii, 11.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna, in giving an account of vociferation, follows Aëtius. He says,\r\nthat it exercises the parts about the mouth and chest; and hence, that\r\nit improves the complexion. He likewise cautions us not to prolong loud\r\nenunciation, lest it occasion a rupture of the vessels. He directs us to\r\nbegin moderate, and then strain the voice gradually, and afterwards to\r\nallow it to sink by degrees, (i, 3, 2.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XX.—ON LASSITUDE FROM EXERCISES.\r\n\r\nThat species of lassitude called the Ulcerose is occasioned by a\r\ncollection of thin and pungent superfluities in the body. In the\r\nTensive there is scarcely any superfluity in the system, but the state\r\nof the muscles and nerves is such that they appear to be stretched. The\r\nInflammative, in which we feel as if the parts of the body were bruised\r\nor inflamed, happens when, being much heated, the muscles attract the\r\nsurrounding superfluities. There is a fourth species, occasioned by\r\nan unnatural dryness of the muscles, in which the body, when stripped\r\nnaked, appears squalid and constricted, and is averse to motion. The\r\ncure of the ulcerose species consists in dispelling the superfluities\r\nby much and soft friction with plenty of oil devoid of astringency. The\r\nindication of cure in the second or tensive species is relaxation, which\r\nmay be accomplished by means of little and soft friction with oil heated\r\nin the sun; by quietude and rest, by tepid baths, and remaining for a\r\nconsiderable time in the warm water; for, if you repeat the bath two or\r\nthree times in succession, you will confer so much the greater benefit.\r\nIn the third species, or the inflammative, there are three indications of\r\ncure: the discharge of the superfluity, the relaxing of the constriction,\r\nand the cooling of the inflammatory state. Plenty of tepid oil, the\r\nsoftest friction, and remaining long in a bath of a moderate temperature,\r\nremove lassitudes of this description. Long-continued quietude is also\r\nproper, and repeated inunction. The treatment of the fourth differs in\r\nno respect, for the first day, from that of the third, except that the\r\nwater ought to be hotter, so as to contract gently; and on the second,\r\nthe restorative kind of exercise must be had recourse to; and when in the\r\nbath, let the person straightway leap into the cistern of cold water. All\r\nthose affected with lassitude stand in need of wholesome food.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There is a short treatise on this subject, among the minor\r\nworks of Theophrastus. He states that, as the excess of motion in this\r\ncase has produced a preternatural dryness of the body, the indication of\r\ncure is to humectate, that is to say, to dilute, by baths and drinks. The\r\nwork contains many ingenious observations; but our limits do not admit of\r\nour giving a proper outline of it.\r\n\r\nOur author copies from Oribasius (Synops. v, 15); see, also, Aëtius (iv,\r\n55 et seq.) They all, however, are indebted to Galen. (De Sanit. tuend.\r\niii, 7.) The ulcerose lassitude, he says, arises from a collection of\r\nexcrementitious superfluities, which are produced by the melting of\r\nfat and muscle. In the second species, called the tensive, there is no\r\ncollection of humours, but the muscular fibres are excessively stretched.\r\nThe third species, or the inflammative, is characterized by a sensation,\r\nas if the parts affected were bruised or inflamed, and happens when the\r\nmuscles, being excessively heated, attract the superfluities from the\r\nsurrounding parts. From the pain being deep seated, it has been called\r\nostalgia. He adds a fourth species, being a case somewhat different from\r\nall those we have been describing. It is the contrary state to that of\r\nthe inflammative, the body appearing squalid and contracted. The first\r\ncase, as it is connected with redundance of humours, is to be cured\r\nby discutients; and hence the proper remedy for it is much friction,\r\nwith emollient oils wholly devoid of astringency. He also approves of\r\nthe gentle exercise called the restorative. The second species, or the\r\ntensive, is to be cured by gentle friction, with emollient oils heated in\r\nthe sun; by complete quietude, and the frequent repetition of the tepid\r\nbath. In particular, unction with oil is proper. The third species, as\r\nit is occasioned by violent motions, and is attended with excruciating\r\npains, is to be cured by the gentlest friction, with the most emollient\r\noils; by the most perfect rest, and the tepid bath. The fourth species,\r\ncharacterized by squalor and constriction of the skin, is to be treated\r\nby the hot bath, to warm and invigorate the skin, then by soft and slow\r\nmotions and friction; and then again by the hot bath. But, he adds, the\r\npatient must straightway leave the cistern of the hot bath, and plunge\r\ninto that of the cold, but not remain long in it. The diet, in all these\r\ncases, is to be restricted and cooling, especially in the Inflammative.\r\n\r\nAs all the subsequent authorities, whether Greek or Arabian, adopt\r\nthe views of Galen, we need not enter into the detail of their plans\r\nof treatment. See Psellus (Opus Medicum); Avicenna (i, 3, 2); Rhases\r\n(Contin. xxxi); Alsaharavius (Pract. xxxi, 11); Averrhoes (Collig. vi,\r\n8; Collect. ii, 15.) The bath, emollient friction, diluent food, and\r\nquietude are the remedies generally recommended by all the ancient\r\nauthorities; and they are directed with a nice discrimination that cannot\r\nbe too much admired. Syrasis, one of Avicenna’s expositors, gives the\r\nrules of treatment with great judgment.\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus gives a fair account of the ancient doctrines on this\r\nsubject. (Meth. Med. iv, 16, and de Præsag. Vita et Morte, ii, 21.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXI.—ON CONSTRICTION OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nConstriction is occasioned either by obstruction or contraction of the\r\npores. Obstruction is produced either by the quantity or thickness of\r\ncrude and indigested humours, and contraction by such things as are cold\r\nor astringent, or desiccative. Upon stripping the body, the affection\r\nis at once recognized by the paleness, hardness, and contraction of the\r\nskin, and by the body’s being heated with difficulty during exercise.\r\nCalefacient remedies are the proper cure for this state of body, and\r\ntherefore we must have recourse to the strongest exercise and the hottest\r\nbaths, and the time of remaining in the cold bath must not be long, nor\r\nmust the water be very cold. And when about to put on their clothes,\r\nlet their bodies be anointed with a sweet and thin oil, of a moderately\r\nheating quality. Obstructions of the skin are also properly cured by the\r\noil of dill, (more particularly if the dill had been green,) and by the\r\noil of black poplars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 16.)\r\nBut a somewhat fuller account is given by Galen. (Hyg. iii, 10.) Like\r\nour author, he states, that this affection is occasioned, either by a\r\ncollection of thick viscid humours in the body, or by contraction, that\r\nis to say, spasm of the cutaneous pores. It is generally brought on, he\r\nsays, by exposure to cold, or going into an astringent bath. He gives\r\nvery minute directions about the treatment, recommending hot baths, and\r\nfriction with oils of a calefacient and attenuant nature. See also Aëtius\r\n(iv, 46); and Actuarius (Meth. Med. iii, 16.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna treats of it in the same terms as Galen. (i, 3, 3, 15.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXII.—ON SPONTANEOUS LASSITUDE.\r\n\r\nSince the Ulcerose lassitude is occasioned by the ill digestion of acrid\r\nsuperfluities, if the cacochymy be small, the restorative exercise will\r\nbe sufficient; but if it be greater and deeper-seated, we must not permit\r\nsuch a one either to exercise or to take any motion whatever, but he must\r\nfor one day remain without food, in a state of quietude and sleep; and\r\nthen in the evening, when he has been rubbed with emollient unguents, and\r\nbathed in tepid water, we must give him wholesome food and some soup.\r\nAnd we must also not restrict him from wine, for nothing contributes\r\nso much to the digestion of half-digested humours as wine. Should the\r\nsymptoms be removed by means of the aforesaid treatment, we may allow the\r\nman to return to his usual employments; but if on the following day they\r\nshould still remain, we must bethink ourselves of a more potent remedy.\r\nIf his strength be good, we must have recourse either to phlebotomy or\r\npurging, having first determined which of these remedies we shall try.\r\nIf he be weak, we must not bleed, but may purge him moderately. If there\r\nbe many crude humours in the system, we must neither bleed, nor purge,\r\nnor exercise, nor move at all, nor try the bath; but we must keep him in\r\na state of perfect quietude, and give him food, drink, and medicines of\r\nattenuating and incisive qualities, without being of a manifestly heating\r\nnature. We may give vinegar and honey, and occasionally some ptisan or\r\nhonied water. And since, in such persons, the lower belly is apt to\r\nbecome swelled and distended with wind, and whatever food is taken to be\r\nconverted into flatulence, it will be better to give some pepper along\r\nwith the food. It will be better, too, to use the composition called\r\nDiospoliticus, and that simple medicine which consists of three kinds of\r\npeppers. Oxymel is also most proper. Let them likewise use a drink made\r\nfrom honey, particularly when it begins to become acid; and such wines\r\nas are gently acid, and such articles of food as are attenuant without\r\nbeing heating, as capers, if taken with vinegar and honey, or vinegar and\r\noil. When the Tensive species of lassitude takes place without exercise,\r\nit indicates that a plethora distends the solid parts of the body. If\r\nthe fulness be occasioned by blood, it will be best to open a vein, or\r\nscarify the ankles. If the Inflammative lassitude be spontaneous, it will\r\nnot endure a delay of a few hours, much less of two or three days, for\r\nit straightway induces a strong fever, unless one anticipate by letting\r\nblood. It will be best, if possible, to abstract blood twice in one day;\r\nfor if care be taken that the first bleeding do not occasion swooning,\r\nit will be of less consequence whether or not it occur after the next.\r\nThose who are not bled will be fortunate indeed if they escape with the\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. These judicious observations are taken from Oribasius\r\n(Synops. v, 21.) See also Galen (de Sanit. tuendâ, iv); Aëtius (iv,\r\n41); Avicenna (i, 3, 3, 16); Alsaharavius (Pract. xxxi, 2, 11); Rhases\r\n(Contin. xxxi); Averrhoes (Collig. vi, 14.)\r\n\r\nAll the authorities recommend nearly the same methods of treatment.\r\nGalen’s account of the subject is full, complete, and satisfactory, but\r\nso lengthy, that we cannot venture even upon an abstract of it. He gives\r\nproper directions for the physician to endeavour to find out the cause\r\nof the lassitude, and to remedy it accordingly. It is often connected,\r\nhe says, with retention of the menstrual or hemorrhoidal evacuation, or\r\nthe stoppage of some customary discharge. When attended with inflammatory\r\nsymptoms, he is very urgent in recommending immediate venesection,\r\nwithout which, as he remarks, the patient cannot escape with his life,\r\nunless he is saved by a critical evacuation, such as bleeding from the\r\nnose, or profuse sweating.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the inflammative lassitude, the head is affected, Aëtius directs\r\nus to open the cephalic vein; when the chest or back, the basilic; and\r\nwhen the whole body equally, the median. He recommends also cooling\r\nherbs, such as beet, mallows, lettuce, and the like, with ptisan and\r\ntepid water. He forbids the use of cold water. After the third day, if\r\nthe patient is convalescent, he allows a thin weak wine, much diluted.\r\n\r\nAverrhoes approves very much of Galen’s directions respecting the\r\ntreatment, except that the peppers recommended by him had not been found\r\nto answer in his climate (Cordova). Instead of them, he directs cinnamon,\r\namber, cassia lignea, and similar aromatics to be given.\r\n\r\nAvicenna joins Galen in cautioning the physician to be guarded in\r\nallowing his patient to take much food, as the veins being emptied by the\r\nremedies applied for removing the lassitude, greedily absorb the chyle\r\nbefore it is properly concocted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXIII.—ON THE REGIMEN OF OLD PERSONS.\r\n\r\nOld age is dry and cold; and its correctives are calefacients and\r\ndiluents compounded with them. Friction is to be applied to the aged,\r\nbut so as not to occasion lassitude. To such as are weak, some such\r\ncourse of diet as the following is to be prescribed: about the third\r\nhour, a small bit of bread with Attic honey; and afterwards, about the\r\nseventh hour, after having undergone friction, and taken exercise and\r\nbaths suitable to old men, they must first get such things as are of a\r\nlaxative nature, and afterwards fish or fowls; and then for supper, such\r\nthings as are wholesome, and not apt to spoil in the stomach. I also\r\ndo not forbid them to use wines prepared with honey, particularly such\r\npersons as are suspected of being threatened with the stone or gout, and\r\nin that case, a little parsley may be added. If phlegm be gendered in\r\nthe stomach, we must of necessity apply such remedies as will remove it,\r\nand return immediately to a diluent diet: we must give them ripe figs\r\nin preference to every other kind of food, and if during the winter,\r\ndried figs, unless they complain of unpleasant symptoms in the right\r\nhypochondrium. When serous and pituitous recrements collect in the bodies\r\nof old men, we must promote the discharge of urine every day, and soften\r\nthe belly, principally by giving oil before a diet. It is obvious, that\r\nall pot-herbs ought to be eaten before all other food, with oil, pickles,\r\nor olives and damascenes seasoned with salt. When the belly is bound, the\r\nherb mercury and the bastard saffron will relieve it. Turpentine also is\r\nproper in such cases. It may be given sometimes to the bulk of a Pontic\r\nwalnut, and sometimes of two or three. Oil also in a clyster is most\r\nuseful to those who are constipated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is copied from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 18.) See\r\nalso Aëtius. (iv, 30.) These directions are all borrowed from Galen (Hyg.\r\nv), who has treated of the subject with his characteristic elegance and\r\ngood sense. The following is a brief exposition of his views of practice\r\nin such cases: “Old age is cold and dry, and is to be corrected by\r\ndiluents and calefacients, such as hot baths of sweet waters, drinking\r\nwine, and taking such food as is moistening and calefacient.” He\r\nstrenuously defends the practice of allowing old persons to take wine,\r\nand gives a circumstantial account of the Greek and Roman wines best\r\nadapted to them. In the case of old persons he approves of three meals\r\nin the day. He recommends the bath to be taken before dinner, which\r\nshould consist of sea fish. He properly expresses his disapprobation\r\nof giving them aloetic pills to remove constipation of the bowels, and\r\nadvises rather that they should be kept open with laxative herbs and\r\noily clysters, in the manner stated by our author. Aëtius remarks, in\r\nlike manner, that old men are much hurt by strong purgatives, which only\r\nincrease the disposition to costiveness. All that is required in such\r\ncases, he remarks, is to lubricate the rectum with an injection of oil.\r\nThe Arabians follow closely in the same strain. Alsaharavius recommends\r\nold persons to drink strong diuretic wines. He also approves of the tepid\r\nbath, and friction with emollient oils. He disapproves of much exercise\r\nand of taking aloetic pills, instead of which he directs oily clysters\r\nand laxative herbs. (Pract. xxvii, 10.) See more particularly Averrhoes’\r\nCommentary on the Cantica of Avicenna (tr. i.) They agree that if an\r\nold man had been accustomed to be frequently bled, the practice is not\r\nto be wholly laid aside. Avicenna particularly approves of a milk-diet.\r\nHe recommends old red wines, but forbids such as are new and sweet. (i,\r\n3, 3.) Even Plato, the philosopher, permits old men to take a liberal\r\nallowance of wine, which he pronounces to be the restorative of youth,\r\nand the corrective of the austerity and despondency of old age. (leg.\r\nii.) See also Athen. (Deip. x, 54, ed. Schweigh.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Hippocrates, old men bear abstinence better than those of\r\nany other period of life. (Aphorism.) The reason of this assigned by his\r\nCommentators, Theophilus and Damascius, is, that their innate heat is\r\nlower than at any other age, and consequently requires less pabulum to\r\nsupport it. (Ed. Dietz. t. iv, 277.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXIV.—FOR A WRINKLED STATE OF THE BODY.\r\n\r\nA wrinkled state of the body may be removed by the farina of bitter\r\ntares, mixed with white vine.\r\n\r\nAnother abstergent composition (smegma), to be frequently rubbed into the\r\nskin: fat figs bruised with bryony, and the burned powder of tares, the\r\nshells of the cuttle-fish (sepia), mixed with a small quantity of honey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY.

XXV.—TO MAKE THE PERSPIRATION FRAGRANT.\r\n\r\nThe perspiration may be rendered fragrant by mixing the leaves of the\r\ncypress, pounded dry, and the bark of the pine in the same ointment. One\r\nought also to remember in the morning, immediately after being dressed,\r\nto taste a small quantity of cassia or savin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is copied from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 21.) See also\r\nRhases (ad Mansor. v, 53.) Rhases recommends the heads of cardui for\r\nfood, and the seeds of juniper or cassia lignea in the drink. His advice\r\nfurther is to rub the body with pastils of roses, and to drink aromatic\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXVI.—TO WARM THE HABIT.\r\n\r\nSince even the habit must be warmed, it will be proper to use a\r\npreparation of a heating nature when in the bath. Let it contain\r\ncalamint, marjoram (sampsuchum), hyssop, bay berries, rosemary, the\r\nstone pyrites, salts, the burnt lees of wine, nitre, pumice-stone, each\r\nin proper proportion; also a small quantity of mustard, stavesacre, and\r\nthe seeds of the thymelæa (granum cnidium). After the bath, use a warm\r\nrestorative (Acopum), and drink a yellow old wine, having taken a sweet\r\ndrink (_propoma_) from wine and honey, pepper, rue, and the like.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. All this Section is taken from Oribasius, excepting the part\r\nrelating to the draught or Propoma. The nature of the Propoma will be\r\nexplained in the Seventh Book. We may just mention that it was a sort of\r\n_liqueur_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXVII.—FOR PALENESS.\r\n\r\nPaleness of the body is diminished by a merry course of life, and\r\ngrateful food, by mixing together radishes, leeks, and the green\r\nchick-pea. The juice of the sweet pomegranate taken internally, restores\r\nthe complexion. Oil, in which the root of the white vine (bryonia) has\r\nbeen long boiled, is likewise proper. This gives tone to the body. For\r\ndetergent applications, form pastils of detergents, as farina, the bulb\r\nof the narcissus, and the root of the bryony. The root also of the bitter\r\nalmond, if taken in abundance, will improve the colour, and likewise the\r\nfruit boiled in water and used for a bath.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius. (Syn. v, 23.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXVIII.—ON LIVIDITY.\r\n\r\nLivid spots are prevented from forming on old men, by rendering their\r\nskin thick and hardy, and by warming the habit. In order to dispel them,\r\nthe black places should be rubbed in the bath with salts, and fomented\r\nwith sponges steeped in a decoction of radish or wormwood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 24.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXIX.—PRESERVATIVES OF THE TEETH.\r\n\r\nThe teeth will not decay if the following things be attended to: in the\r\nfirst place, to avoid indigestion, and frequent repetitions of emetics.\r\nGuard against such food as is hurtful to the teeth, as dried figs, honey\r\nboiled, so as to become very hard, dates which are difficult to rub down,\r\nand all glutinous substances; likewise such things as are difficult\r\nto break, and may thereby loosen the teeth; in like manner also, such\r\nsubstances as set the teeth on edge, and everything which is cold and\r\nputrid. The teeth also ought to be cleaned after supper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is mostly taken from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 25.)\r\n\r\nRhases gives similar directions. He forbids emetics, and recommends\r\nattention to keeping the teeth clean. He praises the following\r\ndentifrice: Of hartshorn, of the seeds of tamarisk, of cyperus, of\r\nspikenard, of each ℥j, of the salt of gem ʒij, to be pulverised, and the\r\nteeth rubbed with it. (Ad Mansor. iv, 21.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXX.—FOR DULNESS OF HEARING.\r\n\r\nDulness of hearing may be prevented by clearing away the sordes from\r\nthe meatus, and by occasionally introducing into the ear a piece of\r\nlinen dipped in a calefacient ointment (dropax), pressing it down, and\r\nthen drawing it out; for this completely clears the opening, and at the\r\nsame time, stimulates the sense of hearing. Afterwards, the meatus is\r\nto be plugged up with a piece of wool of the size of a tare for a day;\r\nand, when it is taken out, the meatus is to be anointed with the oil\r\nof almonds, of spikenard, or of chamomile, with the fat of geese, or\r\na small quantity of ox gall. Again, after a time, rubbing mustard and\r\nfigs together, introduce the collyrium thus prepared, for two hours; and\r\nthen take it out and pour in oil heated in the hollow of the root of the\r\nasphodel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 23.)\r\n\r\nRhases particularly directs great care to avoid indigestion, which,\r\nwithout doubt, is occasionally the cause of indistinct hearing. He\r\nrecommends some almond oil to be introduced into the meatus, and cautions\r\nagainst exposure to cold wind. (Ad Mansor. iii, 23.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXI.—ON DIMNESS OF SIGHT.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid dimness of sight, when they plunge into cold water,\r\npeople ought to open their eyes wide, for thereby the strength of their\r\neyes will be much improved. They ought also to be careful not to hurt\r\nthem by reading. Let them also avoid wine that is thick and sweet, such\r\narticles of food as ascend upwards, whatever is of difficult digestion,\r\nand engenders crude and thick humours, the herb rocket, leeks, and\r\neverything whose pungency ascends upwards. Let them also avoid reclining\r\nlong in a supine position, cold, winds blowing direct in the face, smoke\r\nand dust; and pour daily into the eyes an infusion prepared thus: for a\r\nmonth and a day, put green fennels into an earthen vessel smeared with\r\npitch on the outside, and pour in rain water, and then taking out the\r\nfennels, keep the water laid up for use.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is copied from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 27.)\r\n\r\nRhases gives very copious and sensible directions on this subject, but\r\nmany of them are the same as those given by our author. He forbids all\r\ngross and diffusible articles of food, and also thick wines. Although he\r\ncautions against reading books written in small characters, he recommends\r\nexercising the eyes by looking at large letters or pictures. He also\r\nrecommends various collyria, containing antimony, tutty, calamine,\r\ncamphor, and the like. (Ad Mansor. iv, 22.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXII.—ON REPLETION.\r\n\r\nExcess in diet is a very great error; for, even if the stomach should\r\ndigest it properly, the veins, being over-filled, become affected, are\r\ndistended and burst; they are obstructed, or filled up with vapours,\r\nand become much oppressed. In diseases nothing is worse than plethora\r\nof the veins; for, in fulness of the stomach, the offending matters may\r\nbe evacuated either upwards or downwards, so that it is less pernicious\r\nthan the other, and yet it is by no means desirable. But if there be too\r\nmuch food in the stomach, it must be immediately evacuated by vomiting,\r\nfor there is a danger lest being digested it fill up the veins, more\r\nparticularly if the person who is guilty of the excess be not attentive\r\nto the necessary evacuations. Let him vomit, then, before the food\r\nbecome spoiled; or, if there be any objection to vomiting, it will be of\r\ngreat consequence to bring about frequent discharges from the bowels;\r\nor otherwise, he should indulge much in sleep, and drink often of tepid\r\nwater. When he has digested properly, and more especially if he has had\r\nevacuations by the bowels, let him have baths and fomentations, and let\r\nhim drink moderately of watery draughts, and eat some pickle. But should\r\nhe neither have alvine evacuations, nor digest readily, and if his whole\r\nbody be heavy, averse to motion, and sleepy, and if his mind be oppressed\r\nwith unusual sluggishness, these symptoms indicate plethora of the veins;\r\nand, when lassitude supervenes to these, it will be proper to enjoin\r\nquietude until digestion in the stomach be accomplished, and then to\r\nevacuate by labour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author, as usual, copies from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 28.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates describes accurately the bad effects of plethora, but at so\r\ngreat length that we cannot venture to give an outline of his practice.\r\nWe may mention, however, that purging with hellebore, emetics, the warm\r\nbath, and venesection are his most powerful remedies. (De Diæta, iii, 16\r\net seq.)\r\n\r\nGalen has also a treatise of considerable length on the same subject.\r\nAmong the causes of plethora enumerated by him, we remark that he\r\nmentions the use of the warm bath after meals, whereby he holds that the\r\nsystem is overloaded with imperfectly concocted chyle. (De Plenitudine,\r\nand Meth. Med. ix, 5.) See also Rhases (ad Mansor. ii); Haly Abbas\r\n(Pract. i, 12); Alsaharavius (Pract. v, 4); Averrhoes (Comment. in Cant.\r\nAvicennæ); Avicenna (i, 2, 3.)\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius says that plethora is marked by ruddiness of the body,\r\nheaviness, torpor, large veins, somnolency, a large face, and brawny\r\nlimbs. It is usually accompanied, he adds, by impairment of the\r\nunderstanding, forgetfulness, heaviness of the head, weakness of sight,\r\ngreat pulsation of the arteries, and a disposition to epistaxis. He\r\nrecommends a restricted diet, consisting of articles not very nutritious,\r\nexercise, the bath, along with friction, and medicines calculated to\r\nevacuate the prevailing humour, whether blood, phlegm, or bile.\r\n\r\nHaly’s account is very like our author’s.\r\n\r\nRhases gives a good description of repletion, which, he says, is\r\ngenerally brought on by excess in eating and drinking, along with too\r\nmuch indulgence in sleep. Avicenna’s description is similar.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXIII.—ON INTOXICATION.\r\n\r\nTo those who are intoxicated, vomiting is an immediate relief. It will be\r\nproper that they drink freely of water and honied water, so that they may\r\nvomit freely, and remove the uneasy feelings. After vomiting, let them\r\nuse the bath, along with plenteous unction, and afterwards rest for some\r\ntime, well covered up, until they have slept off their debauch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. These simple directions are extracted from Oribasius.\r\n(Synops. v, 33.) Hippocrates recommends an emetic after intoxication. (De\r\nDiæta, iii, 4.)\r\n\r\nFor the cure of intoxication Haly Abbas recommends the tepid bath,\r\naffusion of tepid water, and friction with oil. If headach prevail he\r\ndirects cold rose oil to be poured on the head; or, if it is summer, cold\r\nwater. After this the person is to be rubbed, and to take things of a\r\ncooling nature, such as prunes, tamarinds, and the like. (Pract. i, 8.)\r\n\r\nRhases recommends vinegar and water, or the like, for drink; the\r\napplication of vinegar and oil of roses to the head, and camphor and\r\nwater to the nose. He also approves of emetics, and of putting the\r\nperson’s hands and feet into cold water. He says one ought to sleep long\r\nbefore going into the bath. (Ad Mansor. v, 71 and 77.)\r\n\r\nThe practice of taking an emetic after a debauch is often alluded to in\r\nthe works of the classical authors. Thus it is mentioned by Aristophanes\r\nin his ‘Acharnenses.’ Suetonius, in the lives of Vitellius and Claudius,\r\nstates that these Emperors were in the practice of procuring vomiting,\r\nin order to relieve themselves from the effects of excessive eating\r\nand drinking. See also Pliny (Hist. Nat. xiv, 28.) Athenæus, upon the\r\nauthority of Mnestheus, the Athenian physician, recommends that a person\r\nwho has drunk wine freely should not go to rest until he has vomited more\r\nor less. He advises afterwards either the affusion, or bath of hot water.\r\n(Deip. xi, 67.) It appears, from Pliny, that the celebrated Asclepiades\r\nof Bithynia condemned the use of emetics, which were so common in his\r\ntime. (Hist. Nat. xxvi, 7.) See also Celsus. (i, 3.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXIV.—ON WRONG DIGESTION OF THE FOOD.\r\n\r\nIt contributes much to the health of those whose food spoils in their\r\nstomachs, that the offending matters be discharged downwards; and when\r\nthey are not so discharged naturally, this operation ought to be promoted\r\nby gentle laxatives. Persons may, with advantage, take, before eating,\r\nan emetic from the drinking of wine, or must. They ought also to be\r\ncounselled not to take food of a strong or offensive smell, nor such as\r\neasily becomes spoiled; but, on the contrary, such as is wholesome. To\r\nsuch persons, evacuations of the bowels at proper intervals, by means of\r\ngentle laxatives, are highly expedient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Oribasius (Euporist. i, 3, and Synops. v, 30.) This\r\nsubject will be more fully treated of in the Third Book.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXV.—ON VENERY.\r\n\r\nFrom sexual enjoyments, the following advantages may be derived: they\r\nrelieve plethora, render the body lighter, promote its growth, and make\r\nit more masculine; they free the mind from the cares which beset it,\r\nand relieve it from ungovernable anger. Wherefore, the best possible\r\nremedy for melancholy is coition. Those also who are otherwise affected\r\nwith mania it will restore to reason. It is also a powerful remedy for\r\nphlegmatic disorders, will restore the appetite to those who have lost\r\nit, and dispel continued libidinous dreams. The temperaments which are\r\nmost adapted for venery are the hot and humid, and these bear it best.\r\nA dry and cooling diet, old age, and the season of autumn unfit for it.\r\nThe diet, therefore, ought to be moistening and heating; and moderation\r\nas to labour and food ought to be observed. And as other kinds of labour\r\nare useful so also are the venereal, when taken in moderation; for they\r\nincite to the act, and, by the habit, procure some alleviation. But\r\nnothing is so much required as abundance of food, which also ought to\r\nbe of a nutritious nature. Of fishes, the best are polypi, (which are\r\notherwise supposed to incite,) and all the class called mollusca; of\r\npot-herbs, the all-good (horminum), hedge-mustard (erysimum), rocket\r\n(irio), and turnip. And the following are as medicines: of pulse, beans,\r\nchick-peas, Sicilian peas, kidney-beans and peas, which fill the body\r\nwith vapours and abundance of food. Rue, as it concocts and dispels\r\nflatulence, blunts the venereal appetite. But I greatly approve of\r\ngrapes, which supply the body with moisture, and fill the blood with\r\nflatus, which rouses to venery. He who is about to proceed to the act\r\nought to guard against repletion, indigestion, lassitude, precursory\r\nvomits and purges, and, in like manner, an acute diarrhœa; for a chronic\r\none is dried up by venery. And strong desires I do not approve of, but\r\nthink that they ought to be contended against, especially by those\r\nwho have any distemper. The most proper season for enjoyment is after\r\ngymnastic exercises, baths, and a moderate repast; for food contributes\r\nto the strength, and diminishes the chills which succeed it. The\r\nproper time, as I said before, is after eating, and before sleep, for\r\nthe lassitude is relieved by sleep. This too is the fittest time for\r\nprocreation on many accounts, and because that the woman falling asleep\r\nis the more likely to retain the semen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The contents of this Section are mostly taken from a fuller\r\naccount of this subject, given in an extract from the works of Ruffus,\r\npreserved by Oribasius. (Med. Col. vi, 38.) See also Aëtius (iii, 18);\r\nGalen (Ars Medica, de Sanit. tuend. iii, 11); Avicenna (Cant.); Averrhoes\r\n(Comment. in Cantica, and Collig. vi, 7); Rhases (ad Mansor. iv, 17);\r\nHaly Abbas (Pract. i, 10, 13); Alsaharavius (Theor. x.)\r\n\r\nThe conclusion at which Galen arrives with regard to venereal exercises\r\nis that they have a tendency to render the body drier, colder, and\r\nweaker, and that these bad effects are to be counteracted by things of a\r\nbracing, heating, and strengthening nature.\r\n\r\nAverrhoes says, venery, in a word, induces the following evils: dryness\r\nof the body, effeminacy, imbecility, exhaustion, and at the same time\r\nprostration; therefore, the friction which is had recourse to after it,\r\nought to remove the inconveniences occasioned by it. This should be much\r\nand rough friction, and be performed with oil.\r\n\r\nAccording to Avicenna, excessive indulgence breaks down the powers of\r\nthe constitution, and superinduces either a cold intemperament or hectic\r\nfever. Abstinence, on the other hand, by those who had been in the habit\r\nof indulgence, is said to bring on heaviness of the head and diseases of\r\nthe joints and testicles. In this case, he recommends rue, and various\r\nother articles, which were supposed by the ancients to be possessed of\r\nanti-aphrodisiacal properties. Cicuta, according to Pliny, produces this\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius forbids coition when the body is either reduced by\r\nabstinence or overloaded with too much food and drink. The proper season\r\nfor it, he says, is after sleep, when digestion is accomplished, and\r\ntowards morning. It is prejudicial, he says, in very hot seasons, and\r\nto persons of a dry intemperament. Rhases, like our author, says that\r\nmoderate indulgence removes plethora, lightens the mind, and cures sorrow.\r\n\r\nAccording to Haly Abbas, the most proper time for enjoyment is after\r\ndigestion, and when the food has descended into the stomach. If performed\r\nbefore sleep, he says, there is most chance of impregnation. Abstinence,\r\nwhen one had become habituated to the act, he says, weakens the natural\r\nheat, hurts the breast, stomach, and liver, induces coldness of the body,\r\nand renders it dry, sluggish, and enervated. Excess, on the other hand,\r\nbrings on premature old age and consumption.\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked that our author and Alsaharavius differ in opinion as\r\nto the best season for partaking of the δωῤ ἐρατὰ χρυσῆς Αφροδίτῆς.\r\n\r\nSee a learned disquisition on this and other similar matters in the\r\n‘Symposiacon’ of Plutarch. Pliny says of it “medetur et lumborum dolori,\r\noculorum hebetationi, mente captis, ac melancholicis.” (H. N. xxviii, 16.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXVI.—ON IMPOTENCE.\r\n\r\nIn cases of impotence, it may be proper to rub the parts frequently with\r\nan ointment containing a small part of the root of the narcissus, or the\r\nseed of the thymelæa, or pellitory, or stavesacre, or the seed of the\r\nnettle, or of anise. Let them also before their meals take a drink with\r\npepper, or satyrium, or rocket, or bastard saffron, or all together.\r\nBefore food, let him also eat the small red bulbi roasted, with salt and\r\noil, or a little of the squill dried in the sun. They may also use the\r\ncompound preparations elsewhere described, and often indulge in obscene\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Athenæus mentions that it was a practice with some to put\r\nsponges into beds, as incentives to venery. He states, upon the authority\r\nof Theophrastus, that certain medicines are possessed of aphrodisiacal\r\nproperties, to an almost incredible degree. (Deipnos, i, 15.) He says\r\nthe immoderate use of wine often induces impotence; and relates that it\r\nhad this effect upon Alexander the Great. (Deipnos, x, 45.) Hippocrates\r\nmentions that many of the Scythians were affected with impotence, by\r\nbeing constantly on horseback. (De Aer, &c. vi, 22.) See Coray’s Note,\r\nand Littré’s Hippocrates, (t. iv, p. 9.) It would appear that many of\r\nthe ancient athletæ, rendered themselves impotent by self-denial and\r\nimmoderate exercise. (Galen. de Loc. affect, vi, versus finem.)\r\n\r\nThe ancients held, that most of the testacea are aphrodisiacal. See\r\nPlautus (Casina, ac. ii, sc. 8, l. 59,) and the note of Lambinus (Ed.\r\nGronov.); also Petronius Arbiter (Satyricon.)\r\n\r\nThe rocket (_eruca_) was particularly celebrated as an aphrodisiacal\r\nherb. See Pliny (H. N. xix, 8), and Juvenal (Sat. ix, 134.); Columella\r\n(in Hort.); Galen (de Fac. Alim. lib. ii.) Ovid calls it _herba salax_.\r\n(Remed. Amor. 799.)\r\n\r\nOn this subject, see Rhases (ad Mansor. v, 62, Contin. xxiv); Avicenna\r\n(iii, 20, 1); Alsaharavius (Pract. xxii, 11.) Rhases gives a long list of\r\narticles which were supposed to be possessed of aphrodisiacal properties,\r\nsuch as nettle-seed, elecampane, rape-seed, mint, rocket, cresses,\r\ncubebs, &c. Avicenna’s account, however, is the fullest. He directs the\r\nparts to be rubbed with liniments, containing stavesacre, pellitory,\r\nsquills, myrrh, assafœtida, and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXVII.—ON INORDINATE VENERY.\r\n\r\nSince by too much indulgence the body becomes flabby, cold, dried,\r\nand weak, it must be supplied with such things as will brace,\r\nwarm, humectate, and strengthen it. To those who indulge themselves\r\nimmoderately, warm clothing is suitable, also rest and sufficient sleep\r\nuntil the body remits from its tension, and they recover from their atony.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is partly taken from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 35.)\r\nA similar account is given by Rhases. (Ad Mansor. v, 67.) Inordinate\r\nvenery, he says, occasions premature old age, dries the body, and brings\r\non frigidity. (Contin. c. xxiv.) See, in like manner, Avicenna (iii, 20,\r\nl, 36.) To restore the body when debilitated by excessive enjoyment, he\r\nrecommends a calefacient and diluent regimen, nutritious food, baths,\r\naromatics, and everything that can exhilarate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXVIII.—ON REDUNDANCE OF SEMEN.\r\n\r\nSome persons collect much semen of a warm nature, and then proceeding\r\nto coition and discharging it, render the body weak, and the stomach\r\nlanguid, and so become emaciated and dried: or, if they abstain from\r\nvenery, they are seized with heaviness of the head, and become feverish;\r\nafter which they have libidinous dreams, and the same thing takes place.\r\nThey must therefore avoid those things which engender semen, and take\r\nsuch kinds of food and medicines as consume it. After the bath they ought\r\nto have their loins rubbed with the oil of roses, or that of apples,\r\nor of unripe olives; and it is better to make them thick by mixing a\r\nlittle wax with them, and the juice of some cooling herb, such as the\r\nhouse-leek, nightshade, the navelwort, or fleawort. In summer these may\r\nbe used, but at other seasons, salt and the juice of the lettuce and\r\nlinseed boiled in water, for it also furnishes a cooling juice. And a\r\nplate of lead applied to the loins will prevent libidinous dreams; and\r\nherbs of a cooling nature, as rue and the tender tops of the chaste tree,\r\nif strewed under one in bed, will have the same effect. For this purpose,\r\nalso, the seed of the chaste tree and of rue may be eaten. Care, however,\r\nmust be taken that the loins be not too much cooled, lest the kidneys be\r\nhurt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section, is taken, with a very few slight alterations,\r\nfrom Galen. (De Sanitate tuendâ, vi, 14.) The same treatment is\r\nrecommended by Avicenna (iii, 20, l, 35); and by Rhases (ad Mansor. v,\r\n67.) Alsaharavius recommends bleeding, and various cooling and astringent\r\nremedies, both internally and externally. (Pract. xxii, 9.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates says that the strychnos cures impure dreams. (De Diæta, ii.)\r\nSerapion states that the lettuce possesses “virtus contraria spermati.”\r\n(De Simpl. ex Plantis.)\r\n\r\nWe may remark here, once for all, that by the _juice_ (χυλὸς) of herbs,\r\nthe Greek medical authors generally mean the decoction. Thus, according\r\nto Dr. Coray, by χυλὸς τῶν ἐρεβίνθων, Hippocrates understood ἀφέψημα\r\nτ. ε. (Xenocrat. de Alim. ex Aquat. p. 219.) In like manner, by “the\r\njuice of ptisan,” was meant strained ptisan, as Hippocrates himself has\r\ndistinctly stated in his treatise on ‘Regimen in Acute Diseases.’\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXIX.—ON PERSONS INJURED BY COLD.\r\n\r\nThose who are much congealed ought to be laid in a warm place, and rubbed\r\nwith the oil of privet, or of the iris. Afterwards, when moderately\r\nheated, they should get pepper, or myrrh, with sweet fragrant old wine,\r\nor Cyrenaic juice in wine or vinegar, or pellitory or castor with\r\nvinegar, and be given food of a heating nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 36.)\r\n\r\nRhases directs us to lay a person congealed with cold in a warm\r\napartment, and to rub with hot hands the whole of his body, with the\r\nexception of the head, which is to be warmed with hot cloths. Persons\r\nhaving warm bodies are then to lie down in bed beside him; and he is to\r\ntake a draught containing assafœtida, myrrh, pepper, and strong wine.\r\nWhen the respiration is fairly restored, he is to take some nourishing\r\nfood and wine; and is then to be covered up with many blankets, and left\r\nto sleep. When he awakes, he is to be put into a hot bath, and after\r\nremaining for a long time in it, he is to be strongly rubbed when he\r\nleaves it with calefacient oil, such as the oil of lilies or narcissus,\r\nto which costus, castor, musk, and spurge have been added. (Ad Mansor.\r\nvi, 5.)\r\n\r\nLet the reader remark the similarity of the ancient practice in the cases\r\nof persons who have been exposed to great cold, and of those who have\r\nbeen poisoned with opium. (See Book Fifth, 43.) Galen remarks, that the\r\neffects of opium, and of the exposure of the body to extreme cold, are\r\nvery like. (Comment. in Epidem. Hippocrat.)\r\n\r\nIn the 4th book of Xenophon’s ‘Anabasis,’ there is an interesting\r\ndescription of the effects resulting from the exposure of the Grecian\r\narmy to extreme cold, and the means which they took to preserve\r\nthemselves from being injured by it. The historian relates that they\r\nrubbed themselves before the fire with an ointment composed of swines’\r\nseam, and oils of sesame, of bitter almonds, and of turpentine. The\r\nCarthaginian soldiers of Hannibal, in like manner, when exposed to great\r\ncold among the mountains of Italy, rubbed their bodies with oil as a\r\nprotection from its effects, and with great success, if we may believe\r\nFlorus the historian: he says, “tunc callidissimi hostes frigidum et\r\nnivalem nacti diem, quam se ignibus prius, oleoque fovissent, (horribile\r\ndictu!) homines a meridie, et sole venientes, nostra nos hieme vicerunt.”\r\n(Hist. Rom. ii, 6.) It is worthy of remark, by the way, that Baron\r\nLarrey, in his account of the retreat of the French army from Moscow,\r\nstates that the inhabitants of southern climates endured the cold better\r\nthan those of the north. The fact that the Carthaginian soldiers rubbed\r\ntheir bodies with oil on the occasion we have mentioned is stated also by\r\nPolybius (Hist. iii, 72), and by Livy (Hist. Roman, xxi, 55.)\r\n\r\nQuintus Curtius relates that the soldiers of Alexander the Great rubbed\r\ntheir bodies with the juice of sesame, instead of oil, when exposed to\r\nintense cold while crossing the Bactrian mountains. (vii, 15.)\r\n\r\nPliny, with his usual terseness, thus states the powers of oil in\r\nprotecting the body both from cold and heat: “Oleo natura tepefacere\r\ncorpus, et contra algores munire; eidemque fervores capitis refrigerare.”\r\n(Hist. Nat. xv, 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XL.—FOR PERSONS SCORCHED BY THE SUN.\r\n\r\nPersons who have been scorched by the sun should be laid in an airy\r\nplace, and have their face, hands, and legs bathed with cold water. If\r\nthirsty, they may drink cold water, if in the practice so to do; this,\r\nhowever, ought to be done considerately, and not much at a time. Let them\r\nalso take some food of easy distribution, rather of a fluid than of a\r\nsolid nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 37.)\r\n\r\nWhen a person has suffered from exposure to great heat, Rhases recommends\r\nrest, the tepid bath, and fruits and food of a cooling and moistening\r\nnature. When there is headach, he directs the head to be anointed with\r\noil of roses and vinegar. (Ad Mansor. vi, i.)\r\n\r\nAverrhoes recommends a person who has suffered from exposure to the sun\r\nto be put into a tepid bath, and rubbed afterwards with refrigerant oils.\r\n(Collect. iii, 9.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLI.—ON COLLECTIONS OF PHLEGM IN THE STOMACH.\r\n\r\nIf you should meet with a person who loathes any wholesome food which is\r\noffered him, who abstains from food, or, if compelled to take it, becomes\r\nsick, who longs after only such things as are acrid, and has no pleasure\r\neven in them, but has his belly swelled up with flatulence, is seized\r\nwith nausea, and enjoys only a short respite by eructations, and on whose\r\nstomach everything spoils and becomes acid,—know for certain that the\r\nremedies which will afford him relief are such as will clear the stomach\r\nof phlegm. I have known one of those so affected, after taking an emetic,\r\nconsisting of radishes out of oxymel, bring up an incredible quantity of\r\nvery thick phlegm, by which he has been straightway completely restored\r\nto health.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This chapter is taken from Oribasius, who, in his turn, is\r\nindebted to Galen.\r\n\r\nA similar account is given by Rhases. (Contin. xi, 1.) He recommends\r\nemetics. (Ad Mansor. iv, 16.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLII.—HOW TO PRODUCE EASY VOMITING.\r\n\r\nSince to those who vomit with difficulty many disagreeable consequences\r\nare apt to happen, it will be proper to explain by what methods one\r\nmay be made to vomit readily; for this operation evacuates phlegm and\r\nlightens the head, and prevents a person who may have eaten immoderately\r\nfrom suffering indigestion, and one who has taken too much wine from\r\nbeing hurt thereby. Let the substances which are taken be neither sour\r\nnor dry, but part of a sweetish and liquid nature, and part acrid. Among\r\nthese the radish is deserving of praise, and also the rocket, and old\r\npickle, green marjoram, and a small quantity of onion and leek. Vomiting\r\nis likewise promoted by ptisans of pulse containing some honey; by soup\r\nof bruised beans and the fat of flesh; but one must not only take the\r\njuice, but swallow whole lumps of it; and one must not spend much time\r\nupon mastication; but these things ought to be soft from boiling. It is\r\nclear, also, that it is the sweetish kinds of wine which ought to be\r\npreferred, for such are aptest to swim upon the stomach; and tepid drink\r\nought to be used. It is proper also to eat almonds dipped in honey, also\r\nsweet cakes, and the moistened seed of the pompion and cucumber pounded\r\nwith honey. The root likewise of the cucumber rubbed with honey has\r\nsome effect. Those who wish to use more powerful medicines, mix some\r\nwine with a decoction of the bulb of the narcissus. Vomiting is also\r\nproduced by the ointment of iris, if one will smear one’s fingers in it\r\nand tickle one’s throat. It is also to be attended to in vomiting not to\r\nintermit after vomiting is once begun; and to bathe the face and wash the\r\nmouth with sour wine or water, for this is beneficial to the teeth, and\r\nrelieves the head.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is abridged from Oribasius. (Med. Collect. viii,\r\n21.) The opinions of Galen, Diocles, and Archigenes, on this subject,\r\nmay likewise be learned from Oribasius. Galen recommends vomiting for\r\ncollections of yellow bile, and when the stomach is loaded with viscid\r\nmatters, but forbids it when the stomach is weak. The opinions of\r\nCelsus are very similar: “Vomitus ut in secunda quoque valetudine sæpe\r\nnecessarius biliosis est, sic etiam in iis morbis quos bilis concitavit.\r\nVomitus utilior est hieme quam æstate; nam tum est pituitæ plus, et\r\ncapitis gravitas major subest. Inutilis est gracilibus et imbecillum\r\nstomachum habentibus: utilis est plenis et biliosis omnibus si vel nimium\r\nse replerunt, vel parum concoxerunt.” The directions given by Celsus for\r\nproducing vomiting are very simple: “Qui vomere post cibum volet, si ex\r\nfacili facit, aquam tantum tepidam antè debet assumere: si difficiliùs,\r\naquæ, vel salis, vel mellis paulum adjicere. At qui mane vomiturus est,\r\nantè bibere mulsum, vel hyssopum, aut esse radiculam debet, deinde aquam\r\ntepidam (ut supra scriptum est) bibere.” Galen commends the bulb of the\r\nnarcissus as an emetic. He forbids those who have contracted chests to\r\ntake emetics frequently. (De Purgantibus Medicinis.)\r\n\r\nAëtius gives an interesting account of this subject in an extract from\r\nthe works of Ruffus. He forbids vomiting when the eyes are affected, or\r\nwhen hæmoptysis is apprehended. He commends it for the cure of arthritic\r\ndiseases, dropsy, and jaundice. One of his simplest emetics consists of\r\nthe decoction of radishes, with the strained infusion of dried figs. He\r\nmentions the oil of privet as a most effectual emetic. (iii, 19.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna’s information on this subject is very ample; but, upon the\r\nwhole, his directions are mostly the same as our author’s. He properly\r\nstates that the too frequent repetition of emetics hurts the stomach, is\r\nprejudicial to the chest, the sight, the teeth, in chronic pains of the\r\nhead, unless arising from sympathy with the stomach: and in epilepsy,\r\nwhen the cause of it is seated in the head, (i, 4.) According to Avicenna\r\nand Averrhoes, the proper season for emetics is the summer. (Cant. I. 1.)\r\n\r\nRhases says that much vomiting hurts the liver, breast, eyes, and lungs,\r\noccasioning hæmoptysis. He directs the person to bind a compress on the\r\nforehead before taking an emetic; and to wash the mouth and face with\r\nhydromel after its operation. He adds that persons who have long necks,\r\nprominent chests, and who are lean, ought to abstain altogether from\r\nemetics. (Ad Mansor. iv, 16.)\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas forbids emetics in chronic complaints of the head and chest,\r\nespecially if the person be threatened with phthisis. He says that the\r\nrepetition of them weakens the stomach, and may induce hæmoptysis.\r\n(Pract. i, 12, 13.) Alsaharavius delivers exactly the same detail of the\r\ncases in which emetics prove hurtful or beneficial. (Theor. x, 2.)\r\n\r\nSerapion gives a full account of these gentle emetics. (De Antidotis, c.\r\n36.)\r\n\r\nOn the simpler methods which the ancients had recourse to in order to\r\nproduce vomiting, see Prosper Alpinus. (Med. Meth. iii, 10.)\r\n\r\nWe would here remark that the predilection of the ancients for vomits has\r\nappeared very extraordinary to some of our modern writers on dietetics,\r\nthe more especially as it was supposed that the ancients made use of\r\nviolent emetics, as for example, the white hellebore, in such cases. It\r\nis certain, however, that the ancients were acquainted with gentler means\r\nof unloading the stomach on ordinary occasions, and that they seldom\r\nmade use of such medicines as the hellebore, except in cases of disease;\r\nand, as we shall see afterwards, were well aware of the danger of giving\r\nstrong emetics unseasonably.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLIII.—ON LAXATIVES AND DIURETICS TO THOSE IN HEALTH.\r\n\r\nSome of the ancients thought it sufficient for health that the bowels and\r\nurine should be evacuated once a day freely and fully, according to the\r\nquantity of food and drink which had been taken; and when the evacuations\r\nwere agreeable to this rule, they were satisfied, or, if otherwise, they\r\nassisted them by taking, in order to increase the urinary discharge,\r\nshepherd’s needle, parsley, asparagus, Macedonian parsley, anise,\r\ncalamint, marjoram, wormwood, the roots of couch-grass and of golden\r\nthistle, tree-medic, and of maiden-hair; all these being boiled in water,\r\nso that the decoction might be drunk with wine. For these things purify\r\nthe blood by the mine, and are of no small efficacy. Alvine discharges\r\nare to be assisted by giving turpentine to the quantity of an olive\r\nwhen going to rest, or, when it is wished to purge more effectually, by\r\nadding a little rhubarb. Soft eggs, of pot-herbs the beet and mallows,\r\nand the soup of shell-fish are also laxative, and these probably will be\r\nsufficient. But if more powerful remedies be required, the herb mercury,\r\nboiled in water with salt, may be eaten, or the decoction drunk; and,\r\nin like manner, the leaves of the elder tree (sambucus), or the root of\r\nthe oak-fern (polypodium) to the amount of two drachms, may be sprinkled\r\nupon pickle, or swallowed in a ptisan; or milk-whey, with salt; or honey,\r\nto the amount of three or four heminæ; or the broth of an old cock, by\r\nitself or with two drachms of bastard saffron, or aloes, to the amount of\r\nabout three chick-peas, may be taken at supper-time. But the best remedy\r\nis dodder of thyme, taken in wine after a moderate supper. But he that\r\nwishes to purge more strongly must take, in the morning, a drachm of this\r\nmedicine infused in vinegar and honey, if in the spring season.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Oribasius treats fully of purgatives towards the end of\r\nthe 8th book of ‘Med. Collect.’ He gives a list of gentle laxatives.\r\n(Euporist. i, 45.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates frequently recommends gentle purgatives for the preservation\r\nof the health. Of this class, the herb mercury appears to have been his\r\nfavourite.\r\n\r\nGalen has given two distinct treatises on purgatives, and the cases in\r\nwhich they are applicable. He dissuades those who are in good health\r\nfrom taking them, but says that they may often be used so as to prevent\r\nthe recurrence of diseases. Hence, he says, that he had often prevented\r\ngout and rheumatism from relapsing, by the seasonable administration of\r\npurgatives. He forbids purgatives when the hypochondria are distended\r\nwith flatulence.\r\n\r\nAëtius gives a very lengthy account of the preparation of purgative\r\nmedicines, which will be noticed more properly in the Seventh Book.\r\nHe states that all medicines of a cutting or penetrative nature are\r\ndiuretic. He mentions plantain, fennel, parsley, seseli, anise, valerian,\r\nbitter almonds, &c. (iii.)\r\n\r\nCelsus gives the following list of gentle diuretics: “Urinam movent\r\nquæcunque in horto nascentia boni odoris sunt, ut apium, ruta, anethum,\r\nocimum, mentha, hyssopum, anisum, coriandrum, nasturtium, eruca,\r\nfeniculum: præter hæc, asparagus, capparis, nepeta, thymum, saturcia,\r\nlapsana, pastinaca, magisque agrestis, radicula, siser, cepa; ex\r\nvenatione, maximè lepus; vinum tenue, piper et rotundum et longum,\r\nsinapi, absinthium, nuclei pinei.” He also gives a long list of laxative\r\narticles, such as cabbage, mallows, sorrel, gourds, cherries, all ripe\r\napples, green figs, cockles, oysters, muscles, milk, crude honey, and\r\nall fatty and salty substances. (ii, 29.) Horace makes mention of the\r\nlaxative properties of oysters, cockles, dock, and white wine—\r\n\r\n              “Si dura morabitur alvus\r\n    Mitulus et viles pellent obstantia conchæ,\r\n    Et lapathi brevis herba; sed albo non sine Coo.”\r\n\r\n                                       (Sat. ii, 4.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna gives very minute directions respecting the use of purgatives.\r\nHe very properly recommends us when a purgative medicine has been taken,\r\nand instead of operating, has occasioned heat, vertigo, and headach, to\r\nadminister an injection. (i, 4.)\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas treats of these medicines in pretty much the same terms as\r\nour author. He remarks that obstruction of the bowels leads to colic,\r\nflatulence, difficult respiration, and vertigo. Retention of urine, he\r\nsays, leads to ulcers in the bladder. He states that diuretics are useful\r\nin diseases of the joints and spine, dropsy, and various complaints, but\r\nare apt to render the body dry. (Pract. i, 12.) Diuretic medicines, he\r\nremarks in another place, are of a hot and sharp nature, so that they\r\nheat the kidneys, and thereby increase their attractive power. (ii, 27.)\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius cautions against the indiscriminate use of purgatives,\r\nwhich, he says, in a dry temperament disposes to phthisis, and to\r\ndropsy when the stomach is weak. When a purgative medicine has induced\r\nhypercatharsis, he prescribes astringent powders, containing sumach,\r\npomegranate, and the like. (Theor. x. 1.)\r\n\r\nRhases gives some very sensible observations on the use and abuse of\r\npurgatives. He says that persons who lead an indolent life, are of a\r\ngross habit, and live freely, are most benefited by them. To those\r\nof a dry temperament, on the other hand, they prove prejudicial, by\r\npredisposing to hectic fever. He recommends fat food and the warm bath\r\nbefore taking a purgative. (Ad. Mansor. iv, 15.)\r\n\r\nSee a full account of these laxative medicines, in Serapion (De\r\nAntidotis.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLIV.—ON CLYSTERS.\r\n\r\nIn constipation of the bowels, when the stomach is naturally weak, and\r\ncannot bear purgatives, recourse must be had to clysters. When phlegm\r\nis contained in the intestines, the clyster may be composed of the\r\ndecoctions of dried figs, and of beet, nitre, the root of the wild\r\ncucumber, honey, and the oil of chamomile or dill. But when the complaint\r\nproceeds from dryness they may be composed of those of marsh-mallows,\r\nfenugreek, chamomile, oil, and a small quantity of honey. And sometimes\r\noil alone, injected to the amount of half a hemina, will produce the\r\ndesired effect; but even this must not be repeated constantly, lest\r\nnature, becoming accustomed to these things, should forget to perform the\r\nevacuation spontaneously.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates frequently recommends the administration of\r\nclysters. Herodotus mentions that the ancient Egyptians had recourse to\r\nclysters at stated periods every month. (ii, 77.)\r\n\r\nOribasius has treated of the composition of clysters, and the cases in\r\nwhich they are to be applied so fully in the eighth book of his ‘Medica\r\nCollectanea,’ that he may be said to have exhausted the subject. It\r\nappears, from his account, that the ancients used a syringe for throwing\r\nup injections. A large clyster, he says, amounts to three heminæ, a small\r\none to one hemina, and a moderate one to two heminæ (two pints). (Synops.\r\ni, 19.)\r\n\r\nCelsus, after some very appropriate observations on the cases which\r\nare benefited by clysters, concludes with the following directions for\r\nthe composition of them: Plain water may be injected, if the case be\r\nslight; or honied water, if stronger means be required; if emollients\r\nbe indicated, the decoction of mallows, of fenugreek, or ptisan may be\r\nused; or if astringents be proper, vervain. Acrid clysters may be formed\r\nof sea-water, or with the addition of some salt, and their strength may\r\nbe increased by boiling. Such a clyster may be rendered still more acrid\r\nby the addition of oil, nitre, or honey. He remarks that the more acrid\r\na clyster is, the greater will be its purgative effect, but the more\r\ndifficult will it be to bear. He says it ought to be neither hot nor\r\ncold. After the injection has been thrown up, he recommends the person to\r\nremain quiet, and to resist the first desire to go to stool. (ii, 12.)\r\n\r\nAëtius treats of clysters very fully. He prefaces his account of the mode\r\nof administering them, with a correct detail of the evils arising from\r\nconstipation, which, he justly remarks, is the precursor of most of the\r\nills which break out in the human frame. (iii, 159.)\r\n\r\nSee a long list of prescriptions for clysters in Serapion. (De Antidotis,\r\ntr. vii, 26.) Rhases and Avicenna give a full account of the nature of\r\nclysters, but supply no additional information on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLV.—ON SUPPOSITORIES.\r\n\r\nWe often use suppositories for the discharge of scybalæ, or when\r\ninjections are not properly evacuated. Suppositories are formed of\r\nroasted salt, honey, and nitre; or thyme may be mixed with boiled honey.\r\nThey are also formed of turpentine rosin, and nitre, and sometimes with\r\na moderate quantity of the seeds of the thymelæa (granum cnidium); but\r\nit irritates the parts, which, therefore, ought to be rubbed with oil.\r\nPellitory and pepper are also added, and are particularly fitted for\r\nparalytics, and for the relief of flatulence from cold. Centaury is also\r\nmixed with pitch and cerate, and is very applicable for paralysis of the\r\ngenital organs. For infants a lump of salt is applied. Figs also are\r\nmixed up with nitre.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is entirely taken from Oribasius. (Synops.\r\ni, 20.) See a fuller account in his ‘Med. Collect.’ (viii, 39), and\r\nAëtius (iii, 160.) Aëtius, after mentioning the composition of certain\r\nsuppositories similar to those of our author, speaks also of using for\r\nthis purpose, figs mixed with nitre (soda?) and grapes deprived of their\r\nstones, with the addition of nitre and cumin.\r\n\r\nActuarius states that it is when the obstruction is seated in the rectum\r\nthat suppositories are particularly applicable. (Meth. Med. iii, 5.)\r\n\r\nSee also Avicenna (iii, 20, 1), and Rhases (Contin. xxiv.)\r\n\r\nThe use of suppositories in the practice of medicine might be traced back\r\nto the earliest times. Mention of them occurs frequently in the works of\r\nHippocrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLVI.—ON MEDICINES WHICH EVACUATE PHLEGM FROM THE HEAD,\r\nMASTICATORIES, ERRHINES AND LINIMENTS TO THE NOSE.\r\n\r\nWe evacuate humours fixed in the head, with the saliva, by mixing some\r\npepper with mastich, if a small discharge only be required; or, if a\r\ngreater evacuation be wanted, by giving directions to chew pellitory\r\nor stavesacre. The root of every species of anemone, when chewed, also\r\nexcites the secretion of saliva, and the rind of the root of cappers.\r\nSerous superfluities may be thus evacuated; but, for thicker phlegm,\r\nwe must gargle with mustard in vinegar and honey, or with sodden wine,\r\nhaving marjoram and hyssop boiled in it. I also mix this with the gargle\r\nformed of mustard in vinegar and honey. When we want to clear the brain\r\nof mucus, we must stimulate it by means of acrid substances, of which\r\nkind some are sternutatories. The juice of either pimpernel, of the\r\nanemones, and of beet purge by the nose. The juice also of the leaves of\r\nthe wild cucumber may be applied to the nostrils, either alone or with\r\nthe decoction or juice of the beet. But sneezing is not at all applicable\r\nfor crude humours contained in the chest, lungs, and head. The following\r\nointment may be rubbed into the mouth: Anoint the roof of the mouth and\r\nuvula with a soap containing the juice of the beet. The same application\r\nmay be used as an errhine. I have also often used the following\r\ncomposition, which is easily prepared: Macerate gith in strong vinegar\r\nfor a day, then next day rub it with the vinegar, and pour it into the\r\nnose. Sometimes the gith may be rubbed with old oil; and I apply it in\r\nthis manner. Archigenes used it in the same manner for obstruction of the\r\nnostrils. Crito used the former cure, along with vinegar, for jaundice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. i, 21.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates makes frequent mention of the _caput-purgia_, or medicines\r\nwhich purge the head. On the composition of these medicines, see in\r\nparticular Aëtius (iii, 140-1); Nonnus (Epit. 17); and Serapion (de\r\nAntidotis, vii, 31.) They contain such articles as these: pepper, nitre,\r\nwhite hellebore, spurge, gith, pellitory, mastich, turpentine, mustard,\r\nchalcitis, alum, and the like. The errhines were used principally in\r\nobstructions of the nose, and when the sense of smell was impaired. The\r\n_apophlegmatismi_ were supposed to prove useful in chronic affections of\r\nthe head, impairment of the senses of smell and sight, and also when the\r\ntongue and throat were affected.\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus gives a full account of the errhines, masticatories,\r\nand cough medicines of the ancients. (Med. Meth. iii, 11.) He makes the\r\n_caput-purgia_ to be the same as the errhines, and the _apophlegmatismi_\r\nthe same as the masticatories of the moderns.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLVII.—ON EMMENAGOGUES.\r\n\r\nAll diuretics promote also the flow of the menses, such as the decoction\r\nof the root of the cabbage, the root of the peach, rue, marigold,\r\ndittany, and the seed of rocket. The same effect may be produced\r\nby certain substances when applied to the mouth of the womb, as\r\nsuppositories, such as rue rubbed with honey, or the juice of leeks, or\r\nfinely-powdered germander, or myrrh, triturated in wine, or the rennet of\r\na hare.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. i, 22.) A\r\nfuller list of the medicinal articles which were supposed by the ancients\r\nto promote the menstrual discharge is given by Aëtius. (iii, 153-4.) It\r\ncontains cassia, myrrh, thyme, centaury, wormwood, nettle, elaterium,\r\nblack hellebore, turpentine-rosin, cumin, sage, and the like. All these\r\nwere used in injections and suppositories. The following were given by\r\nthe mouth, and were held to be likewise diuretic: hedge-mustard, rue,\r\nmarjoram, southernwood, sagapene, galbanum, spikenard, the herb mercury,\r\nsavin, iris, birthwort, &c. See Albengnefit (Libellus.)\r\n\r\nDioscorides is censured by Dr. Cullen as being too credulous in assigning\r\nemmenagogue properties to a variety of articles in the Materia Medica.\r\nPerhaps, however, there is some foundation for the doctrine of the\r\nancients, that all hot diuretic medicines are in so far emmenagogue.\r\nProsper Alpinus maintains this opinion, but remarks that the action of\r\nthe emmenagogues is more uncertain than that of the diuretics, and must\r\nbe assisted by warm baths, pessaries, and fomentations. We shall have\r\noccasion to treat more fully of these medicines in the Third Book.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLVIII.—ON SUDORIFICS.\r\n\r\nThe following medicines are sudorifics: The dried powder of chamomile,\r\nsprinkled upon oil, and rubbed briskly upon the skin, seseli, pellitory,\r\nthe seed of the rosemary, anise; and in like manner, when sprinkled upon\r\noil; nitre toasted, and not very fine, with oil; the flower of salt mixed\r\nwith oil; Cyrenaic juice diluted with water, which may be rubbed into the\r\nbody, and taken in a draught, to the amount of a chick-pea. Calamint, in\r\nlike manner, when drunk with honied water, and rubbed externally with oil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is mostly copied from Oribasius. (Synops. i,\r\n23.) Aëtius enumerates a good many more medicines of this class. Of these\r\nsome are to be taken by the mouth, as cumin, bay berries, Cyrenaic juice,\r\ncastor, and lovage; some are to be rubbed into the skin, as nitre with\r\ncommon oil, the oil of dill, of chamomile, of bays, and of radishes; and\r\nsome are to be used in fumigations, as pennyroyal, the seed of balsam,\r\nand so forth. He recommends these medicines in jaundice, and for coldness\r\nand constriction of the skin. (iii, 157.)\r\n\r\nCelsus treats of the methods for producing free perspiration with more\r\nthan his usual minuteness. Sweating, he says, may be produced either\r\nby dry heat or by baths. The modes of applying dry heat, which he\r\nmentions, are by heated sand, the laconicum or sweating apartment of the\r\nancient bath (see Sect. LI), the clibanus or moveable furnace, and the\r\nvapour-baths of Baiæ. To these he adds strong exercise. He also treats\r\nminutely of the application of baths and fomentations for the cure of\r\ndiseases, (ii, 17.) Consult Stobæus (100.)\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas directs us to restore the perspiration, when stopped, by\r\nexercise, friction, baths, and the affusion of hot water over the body.\r\nHe further recommends friction with the oil of violets, and such things\r\nas are mentioned by our author. (Pract. i, 12.)\r\n\r\nRhases recommends internally, castor, opoponax, or opium mixed with\r\nhoney, and given in tepid water. Externally, he recommends friction,\r\nwith the oil of chamomile, of pellitory, or the like. (Contin. 31.)\r\nMesue mentions fumigations with calamint, cinquefoil, carpobalsam,\r\nand bdellium. Albengnefit recommends the same, and also friction with\r\ncalefacient oils, and the internal administration of cumin, calamint, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nThe ancients, as Prosper Alpinus remarks, seem to have trusted more in\r\nexternal than in internal means for producing free perspiration. They\r\nwere aware that when the system is greatly over-heated, a draught of cold\r\nwater, by reducing the temperature of the body, may prove sudorific.\r\nThis fact is distinctly stated by Galen; and, in accordance with this\r\nprinciple, Rhases prescribes cold water in the hot stage of the smallpox,\r\nto facilitate the eruption of the pustules.\r\n\r\nOn the sudatoria or vapour-baths of the ancients, see Baccius (de\r\nThermis, iv), and Sect. LI, below. Horace thus alludes to the\r\nvapour-baths at Baiæ:\r\n\r\n            “Sane myrteta relinqui,\r\n    Dictaque cessantem nervis elidere morbum\r\n    Sulphura contemni vicus gemit.”\r\n\r\n                               (Epist. i, 15.)\r\n\r\nUpon which Sanadon remarks: “By _sulphura_, the poet means the stoves,\r\nwhere sulphureous vapours exhaling from the earth cause a dry heat, which\r\nprovokes sweat.”\r\n\r\nAmong the artificial means used by the ancients for procuring\r\nperspiration, we may here mention the sand-bath, as it was called, which\r\nconsisted in rolling the body in sand heated by the sun. (Cælius Aurel.\r\nTard. Pass, iii, 4; Avicenna, i, 2, 2, 20.)\r\n\r\nStrong friction in the sun was also used as a means for producing\r\nperspiration. See, in particular, Avicenna (i, 2, 2, 20.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLIX.—ON AIRS.\r\n\r\nThe best kind of air is that which is perfectly pure, such as that which\r\nis not defiled with the exhalation from lakes or marshes, nor from any\r\npit which emits pestilential vapours. That also which is impregnated\r\nwith the exhalations from a canal conveying the impurities of a city\r\nis deleterious, and indeed every kind which is loaded with vapours is\r\nnot good; as also that which is contained within any hollow place, shut\r\nup on all sides by high mountains, and not admitting of ventilation.\r\nThose, therefore, which are thus deleterious, prove hurtful to all\r\nages and temperaments, whereas the best kinds agree with all. But\r\ntheir differences as to quality—I mean heat, coldness, dryness, and\r\nhumidity—have not the same effect upon all. Those of a proper temperament\r\nare benefited by temperate air, whereas those labouring under an\r\nintemperament derive benefit from the opposite kind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The first part of this Section is taken from Oribasius.\r\n(Synops. i, 24.) The remaining part will be found in the ‘Med. Collect.’\r\n(ix, 1), where the subject is treated of at great length. See, also,\r\nAëtius (iii, 162.) All these authors, however, are much indebted to\r\nGalen. (De Sanitate tuendâ, i.) According to Galen, the moon produces\r\nchanges in the atmosphere, whereby she occasions putrefaction of dead\r\nbodies, impairs the colour, and hurts the head of living persons. (De\r\nDiebus Criticis, iii.) On the supposed causes why the moon occasions\r\nputrefaction, see Plutarch (Synops. iii.)\r\n\r\nAntyllus says that there are many differences of airs: some arising\r\nfrom the season of the year; some from the changes of the moon; and\r\nsome from the hour of the day or night; some from thickness or tenuity,\r\nmotion or rest, or from the admixture of terrene exhalations. The sun,\r\nhe adds, warms the body; but the moon rather humectates, and, therefore,\r\nshe moistens the brain, and occasions the putrefaction of the flesh;\r\nrenders the bodies of those who sleep in the open air more humid and\r\nobtuse; and, for the same cause, she induces epilepsy and heaviness of\r\nthe head. Cold air, he says, produces plumpness, good nutrition, and the\r\nformation of fat; it promotes the growth of the body, and hence, the\r\ninhabitants of northern climates are remarked to possess this character.\r\nIt is unsuitable, however, to all acute disorders; and is also improper\r\nfor certain chronic diseases, such as consumption, cachexy, paralysis,\r\napoplexy, and rheumatism. Warm air consumes the body, attenuating and\r\nwasting the system, but it is preferable to cold air for imparting vigour\r\nand agility; it tries the powers, is useful in affections of the nerves\r\nand chest, but not in those of other parts. Thick air has no other good\r\nproperty, except that it prevents the powers from being dissipated. Thin\r\nair is most conducive to health. The air of high situations is said by\r\nhim to be more salubrious to all persons, except those labouring under\r\ndiaphoresis or syncope, and the aged. The atmosphere of places near the\r\nsea, he remarks, is milder than that of inland parts. Places in the\r\nneighbourhood of marshes are at all times unhealthy; but, in summer,\r\ntheir atmosphere is pestilent. Those by a river side are cold and\r\nchangeable. See more fully Stobæus. (Sermo xcix.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates gives many interesting observations on the effect of climate,\r\nand the state of the atmosphere, in influencing the health; but they are\r\ndelivered so much in detail, that my limits do not admit of my entering\r\ninto an exposition of them. (De Aëre Aquis, Locis.) The account there\r\ngiven of the effects of stagnant water when used as drink is particularly\r\ndeserving of attention. He says it produces diseases of the spleen,\r\ndropsies, and the like. See Coray’s edition of this treatise.\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas gives a very elaborate disquisition on this subject. He\r\ndescribes minutely the characters of salubrious airs, and the changes\r\nproduced upon them by the seasons of the year, the state of the winds,\r\nthe nature of countries, and the stars, that is to say, the sun and\r\ndog-star. (Theor. v.) See also Rhases (Contin. xxxiii); Avicenna (i, 2,\r\n2.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. L.—ON WATERS.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary also to be skilled in the good and bad properties of\r\nwaters, for of all things water is of most use in every mode of regimen.\r\nIt is necessary to know that the best water is wholly devoid of quality,\r\nas regards taste and smell, is most pleasant to drink and pure to the\r\nsight; and when it passes through the præcordia quickly one cannot find\r\na better drink. But such as remains long there, and proves pungent to\r\nthe stomach, which it swells up with wind and loads, is to be reckoned\r\npernicious. Such waters are neither soon heated nor cooled, and those\r\nthings which are boiled in them are slowly and improperly boiled. It is\r\nbetter therefore to prove such water by trial, which he who wishes may do\r\nby attending to the following characters: Those which run to the north,\r\nand from the sun, pass slowly through the stomach, and are indigestible;\r\nthey are slowly heated and cooled. Those which are strained through any\r\npassage or soil to the east are soon cooled and soon heated, and are to\r\nbe supposed to be very good. Those also are good which are colder in\r\nsummer and warmer in winter. Some judge of waters by weight, counting\r\nthat the best which is lightest. This, if joined to the circumstances\r\nalready mentioned, may be deserving of consideration, but is not of\r\nitself a sufficient criterion of goodness. Rain water, as Hippocrates\r\nremarks, is the lightest, the sweetest, the most limpid, and the\r\nthinnest, because that which is lightest and thinnest is attracted by the\r\nsun, who draws such particles to him, not only from all other waters, but\r\nalso from the sea, and from bodies. Hence also it is the most prone to\r\nputrefaction, as being composed of many different qualities. Let no one\r\nsuppose that the water which is most prone to putrefaction is the worst,\r\nfor susceptibility of change is rather a good than a bad property; so\r\nthat if it has the other characteristics of the best water, and is prone\r\nto putrefaction, it is to be reckoned the finest possible. When beginning\r\nto turn it proves the cause of hoarseness, coughs, and roughness of\r\nspeech, to those who drink it. Of rain waters that which falls in summer\r\nand during thunder is preferable to that which falls in stormy weather.\r\nThat from ice and snow is the worst, for during congelation the finest\r\nparticles of the water are squeezed out. But waters which contain\r\nimpurities, have a fetid smell, or any bad quality, may be so improved by\r\nboiling as to be fit to be drunk; or, by mixing them with wine, adding\r\nthe astringent to that which is sweeter, and the others to the more\r\naustere. Some kinds of water it may be expedient to strain, such as the\r\nmarshy, saltish, and bituminous. Those which are very cold are to be\r\ndrunk after food, and not in great quantity. Some also have discovered\r\ncertain articles of food and drink for correcting the bad properties of\r\nwaters. Thus some beforehand drink of the decoction of chick-peas, or\r\neat them; others, wild carrots boiled with some small fish, and fennel\r\nin like manner; whilst others again eat beet and gourds beforehand with\r\nsalts and diluted wine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author has given an outline of Hippocrates’ opinions\r\non this subject, and for fuller information, we must refer to his work\r\nquoted in the preceding Section.\r\n\r\nThe characters of the different kinds of water, are thus given by Celsus\r\nwith his usual terseness: “Aqua levissima pluvialis est: deinde fontana;\r\ntum ex flumine, tum ex puteo; post hæc ex nive, aut glacie; gravior his\r\nex lacu; gravissima ex palude.” (ii, 18.) Their characters are somewhat\r\ndifferently given by Athenæus. Thus, he states, that water from snow\r\nor ice is lighter and better than rain water; otherwise his remarks on\r\nthe qualities of waters are very interesting. He recommends a moderate\r\ndraught of water at the commencement of a feast, in order that the veins,\r\nbeing in so far filled by it, may not greedily absorb the chyle before it\r\nis properly concocted. (Deipnos, ii, and Pliny, Hist. Nat. xxxi, 21.)\r\n\r\nOur author’s account is abridged from Galen and Oribasius (Collect. Med.\r\nx), or rather is copied entire from ‘Euporist.’ (i, 14.) Aëtius gives a\r\nfuller account extracted from Ruffus (iii, 165.)\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas treats of this subject at great length. His characters of the\r\ndifferent kinds of water agree very well with those given by our author.\r\nHe states that rain water is the purest, and snow water the most impure.\r\nHaly Abbas condemns the indulgence in a copious draught after a meal. The\r\nreasons he assigns for its proving injurious are, that it prevents the\r\nsurface of the stomach from coming into proper contact with the food,\r\nand also that it reduces the natural temperature of the stomach. He\r\nrecommends a person, if thirst be urgent, to allay it by drinking a small\r\nquantity slowly. (Theor. v, 29.)\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius advocates similar views. He also forbids drink during the\r\nnight, as the sensation of thirst may be fallacious; and at all events,\r\nhe says, it is only increased by indulgence. (Theor. xiii, 1, and xii,\r\n2.)\r\n\r\nRhases, in like manner, states that a draught of water immediately\r\nafter eating impairs digestion, but is proper after digestion has taken\r\nplace. (Contin. xxxiii.) Rhases, in another place, states that ice is\r\nprejudicial to the health, especially of old persons, by congealing\r\nthe stomach and hurting the nerves. He admits, however, of the use of\r\nwater cooled in snow, but recommends its effects to be counteracted by a\r\nmoderate allowance of wine. Water which has been drawn from a very deep\r\nwell he directs to boil before using it. (xxxvii, i, 70.)\r\n\r\nIn an anonymous treatise on diet lately published by Ideler, the drinking\r\nof cold water immediately after a meal is strongly condemned, as being\r\nhurtful to the digestion. (Phys. et Med. Græc. Minor. vol. ii, p. 197.)\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal beverages of the Greeks and Romans:\r\nWine diluted with water; Mulsum, or a composition of honey and wine,\r\nresembling the modern clary; Hydromel, or honied water; Zythi, or various\r\nkinds of ales; the Spathites, a wine prepared from palms, mentioned\r\nby our author (iii, 39); the Sicera, or cider, prepared from apples;\r\nPerry, prepared from pears; Posca or oxycrate, a mixture of vinegar and\r\nwater; the Cyceon, a mixture of wine, honey, flour, and water, according\r\nto Hesychius; the Dodra of the Romans, very like the cyceon; Ptisan,\r\nprepared from polenta; Barley-water, mentioned by Hippocrates (de Morb.\r\nAcut.) and well described by the Arabians; the Lora, a small table-wine\r\nprepared from the husks of grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LI.—ON BATHS.\r\n\r\nI think well of the cold bath, and yet I do not say that it is proper\r\nfor those who use no restriction as to diet, but only to those who live\r\ncorrectly, and take exercise and food seasonably. It may answer with most\r\npeople very well, when they want to get much cooled, to swim in water\r\nduring the season of summer, provided they are young and brawny, and have\r\nbeen previously heated by friction. They ought to attend, however, that\r\nthey be not in a state of lassitude from venery, or any other cause, nor\r\nsuffering from indigestion, nor after vomiting nor after evacuation of\r\nthe bowels, nor when in want of sleep. It may be attended with danger,\r\nif used at random. But the warm bath is the safest and best, relieving\r\nlassitude, dispelling plethora, warming, soothing, softening, removing\r\nflatulence wherever it fixes, producing sleep and inducing plumpness. It\r\nis expedient for all, man and woman, young and old, rich and poor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We think ourselves called upon in the first place to give\r\nsome account of the Thermæ, or Public Baths, of the ancients, as an\r\nacquaintance with their construction and many matters relating to them\r\nis indispensably necessary in order to understand the subject now in\r\nhand. We need scarcely mention that the Romans surpassed any nation that\r\nhas ever existed in the magnificence of their public baths. An ancient\r\nTherma consisted of four distinct apartments for as many different\r\npurposes: 1, Tepidaria; 2, Laconicum; 3, Calidaria; 4, Frigidaria. The\r\n1st, or Tepidaria, called also Apodyterium, derived its former name\r\nfrom its being filled with tepid air, and the latter from its being the\r\nplace in which the bathers undressed. The 2d, or Laconicum, called also\r\nSudatorium, was an apartment filled either with heated air or steam,\r\nthat is to say, it was, according to different usages, an air-bath or\r\na vapour-bath. The 3d, or Calidaria, was a cistern for containing warm\r\nwater. The 4th, or Frigidaria, was a cistern for cold water. The mode in\r\nwhich the ancients went through the process of bathing was as follows.\r\nFirst they went into the Tepidaria, where they left their clothes, and\r\nproceeded to the Laconicum, and there they were carefully scrubbed with\r\nthe flour of beans, soda, &c., and then went into the hot bath, where\r\nthey remained for some time, and coming out of it, they took a plunge\r\ninto the cold-water bath, and then returned to the Tepidaria, where they\r\nunderwent the Restorative friction, that is to say, were rubbed with\r\noils or ointments, and sprinkled with fragrant powders, and then they\r\nresumed their clothes. That the order in which the ancients took the\r\ndifferent baths was that which we have described may be inferred from the\r\nconstruction of those now remaining, from a passage in Galen’s works (t.\r\niv, p. 146, ed. Basil), and from Stephanus (Comment. p. 259, t. i, ed.\r\nDietz.) See also Auctores de Balniis pluries, Baccius de Thermis pluries,\r\nand Robertellus Lacon. explic. Pisanæ urbis. In the public baths the\r\nancients always made use of common water. The ordinary hour for the bath\r\nwas about two o’clock in the afternoon, but no one was restricted to any\r\nhour from the dawn to sunset. Galen approves of taking the bath in the\r\nmorning, provided one had supped sparingly. (De Sanit. tuendâ, vi.) All\r\nagreed in condemning the use of the bath after a full meal. (Persius,\r\nSat. iii; Juvenal, Sat. i, 143; Horat. Epist. vi, 61; Avicenna, Libel,\r\n&c). The ancients had also various other modes of practising the bath in\r\nprivate, some of which we shall briefly notice. The Clibanus, mentioned\r\nby Celsus (ii, 17), was probably a portable stove. The Pensiles Balneæ\r\nwere small baths suspended by ropes from the ceiling of the house, in\r\nwhich luxurious persons were rocked. (Pliny, xxvi, 3.) Hip-baths, either\r\nof plain water, or water medicated with herbs, or of oil and water, are\r\nrepeatedly mentioned by all the medical authors, and are particularly\r\ndescribed by Aëtius and Avicenna. The _douche_ or dashing with water is\r\nrecommended by Aëtius, in ardent fever, ophthalmy, &c.; but he directs\r\nthat it should not be carried far. Sprinkling with plain water, or the\r\ndecoctions of emollient herbs, is recommended when the patients are so\r\nweak that they cannot bear the bath.\r\n\r\nHippocrates thus explains his views as to the effects produced by baths:\r\nThe bath of sweet waters humectates and cools, for it imparts moisture\r\nto the body. The salt bath is calefacient and desiccative; for, being\r\nnaturally hot, it attracts moisture from the body. When the body is\r\nfasting the hot bath is attenuant and refrigerant; for by its heat it\r\nattracts the moisture from the body, and when the flesh is deprived of\r\nmoisture the body is cooled. Put after a meal it heats and humectates,\r\nby expanding to a greater bulk whatever predominates in the body. The\r\ncold baths produce the contrary effects; for when the body is fasting\r\nthey impart heat and moisture to it, and after a meal they abstract\r\nmoisture, and being cold they fill it with dryness. Unction with oil is\r\ncalefacient, moistening and emollient. (De Diæta, ii, 36.) In another\r\nplace he states that the warm bath, in moderation, softens and enlarges\r\nthe body; but when taken immoderately it humectates dry bodies, and dries\r\nhumid bodies. (De Affectionibus, c. 47.)\r\n\r\nCelsus gives some ingenious reflections on the effects of the bath,\r\nespecially in fever. He thus states the purposes for which it is applied:\r\n“Fere adhibetur, ubi summam cutem relaxari, evocarique corruptum humorem,\r\net habitum corporis mutari expedit.” He recommends friction with oil\r\nbefore going into the bath. (ii, 17.)\r\n\r\nOur author copies from Oribasius (Euporist. i, 16.) See a fuller account\r\nin Med. Collect. (x, 6); Galen (de Sanitate tuendâ); Aëtius (iii, 169);\r\nand Avicenna (i, 3, 2.) Galen particularly recommends the cold bath to\r\npersons in the prime of life, and during the summer season. Before going\r\ninto the bath they are to get well rubbed first with rough towels and\r\nthen with oil. He recommends them to plunge into the water at once, and\r\nnot descend gradually. After coming out of the water he directs them to\r\nget rubbed with oil, until the skin is warmed. Agathinus forbids infants\r\nto be bathed in cold water, but recommends the warm bath for them.\r\n(Oribasius, Med. Collect. x, 7.)\r\n\r\nGalen and Aëtius direct the bath of oil to be formed by adding the fifth\r\npart of heated oil to a bath of water. They recommend it in protracted\r\nfevers attended with chills, convulsions, retention of urine, and to\r\nrelieve lassitude, and nervous pains. The learned Bernard remarks that\r\nit must have been the expense with which it is attended that has led\r\nto the disuse of the bath of oil. (Ad Nonni Epitom.) Avicenna and his\r\nexpositor, Gentilis Fulginas, particularly recommend it for retention of\r\nurine. Mengus Faventinas pronounces it to be highly anodyne. (Auctores de\r\nBalneis.)\r\n\r\nPsellus says that the warm bath relaxes, softens, and induces sleep,\r\noccasioning plumpness of the body. (Opus Medicum.)\r\n\r\nActuarius forbids the use of the bath to those whose systems are loaded\r\nwith superfluities and bad humours. (De Diæta, xi.) Averrhoes lays down\r\nthe same prohibition. (Coll. ii, 4.)\r\n\r\nThe proper time for the bath, according to Haly Abbas, is after exercise,\r\nand before eating. If used before exercise, it proves injurious, by\r\noccasioning the distribution of any superfluities which may be remaining\r\nindigested in the body, and determining them to improper parts. If used\r\nimmediately after a meal, he says, it proves hurtful, by promoting\r\nthe absorption of unconcocted chyle, and sending humours to the head.\r\nBut if used after exercise, and before a meal, it moistens the body,\r\nstrengthens the vital heat, promotes digestion, opens the pores,\r\nmitigates pain, and dispels flatulence. He adds, a short continuance in\r\nthe bath, warms and moistens the body, but a long warms and dries it.\r\n(Theor. v, 13.) In another place he says that the proper time for the\r\nbath is after exercise, yet not immediately, nor until the powers of the\r\nsystem are in some degree recruited; but the body is to be first rubbed\r\nwith oil, and then the bath is to be taken. (Pract. i, 5.)\r\n\r\nThe uses of the bath, according to Alsaharavius, are, to moisten the\r\nbody, open the pores, dispel flatulence, remove repletion, procure sleep,\r\nrelieve pains, fluxes of the bowels and lassitude, to restore lean bodies\r\nto plumpness and obesity, if used after a full diet, to soften contracted\r\nlimbs, moisten dry bodies, and dry humid. The evil effects of it when\r\nmisapplied, are prostration of the vital powers, syncope, and determining\r\nthe humours to weak parts. (Theor. xi, 1.)\r\n\r\nAsclepiades, of Bithynia, was a distinguished advocate for the use of the\r\nbath. See Pliny (H. N. xxxvi, 3); Celsus (ii, 6); Apuleius (Florid. 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LII.—ON THE NATURAL BATHS.\r\n\r\nOf Natural baths, some are nitrous, some saline, some aluminous, some\r\nsulphureous, some bituminous, some copperish, some ferruginous, and some\r\ncompounded of these. Of all the Natural waters the power is, upon the\r\nwhole, desiccant and calefacient; and they are peculiarly fitted for\r\nthose of a humid and cold habit. The nitrous and saltish are beneficial\r\nto the head, to defluxions of the chest, to a watery stomach, to\r\ndropsies, to swellings after diseases, and to collections of phlegm. The\r\naluminous are fitted for spitting of blood, vomiting from the stomach,\r\nimmoderate menstrual discharges of women, and repeated miscarriages.\r\nThe sulphureous are soothing and warming to the nerves, and relieve\r\nlassitude, but weaken and upset the stomach. The bituminous occasion\r\nfulness of the head, and hurt the senses, but occasion a steady degree of\r\nheat, and soothe when persevered in. The copperish are peculiarly adapted\r\nfor the mouth, tonsils, uvula, and eyes. The ferruginous are useful to\r\nthe stomach and spleen. The descent into the water ought to be without\r\nprecipitation, in order that its impression may sink deep into the body\r\nwhen in a relaxed state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. i, 29.) A\r\nfuller account is given in the Med. Collect. (x, 3 et seq.) See further,\r\nAëtius (iii, 167); Haly Abbas (Theor. v, 13); Rhases (Contin. xxxvii);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 15.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates briefly mentions thermal springs of iron, copper, silver,\r\ngold, sulphur, alum, bitumen, and nitre. He speaks unfavorably of all\r\nsuch waters, as being hard and heating. (De Aër, &c. 35.) The ancient\r\nnitre or natron, it is now well known, was a native carbonate of soda.\r\nThe alum, mentioned by Hippocrates and the other writers on the thermal\r\nsprings, cannot have been the alum of modern commerce, since it is very\r\nrarely to be detected in mineral waters, but it must have been the alumen\r\nplumosum, or hair alum, which Klaproth found to consist principally of\r\nthe sulphate of magnesia and iron.\r\n\r\nBy far the most interesting account which has been transmitted to us of\r\nthe thermal springs of the ancients is that given by Pliny in the 31st\r\nbook of his ‘Natural History.’ He more especially commends the medicinal\r\nwaters near Baiæ, consisting of all the kinds mentioned by Hippocrates\r\nand our author, namely, sulphureous, bituminous, saline, &c. Some of\r\nthem, he says, prove medicinal by their vapour. He speaks of their good\r\neffects in diseases of the nerves and joints, and mentions generally\r\nof them that they open the bowels. Pliny’s account of the virtues of\r\nmedicinal springs in different parts of the world is curious, but mixed\r\nup and disfigured with his usual traits of credulity and love of the\r\nmarvellous.\r\n\r\nThe tepid springs of Albula, in the vicinity of Rome, are briefly\r\nmentioned by Pliny (l. c.); Vitruvius (viii, 3); and Pausanias\r\n(Messeniaco.) Among the natural springs of the Romans the Fons Aponus, or\r\nBagni d’Abano, near Padua, is particularly celebrated. Claudian’s poem in\r\npraise of its medicinal waters is well known. He calls it\r\n\r\n    “Publica morborum requies, commune medentûm\r\n            Auxilium, præsens numen.”\r\n\r\nJoannes de Dondis has given an elaborate disquisition on the hot springs\r\nof Padua, but it is not by any means so satisfactory as could be desired.\r\n\r\nThis would be the proper place to give some account of the ancient\r\nTemples of Health, most of which, there is reason to believe, were\r\nconnected with medicinal springs. But our information respecting them\r\nis so scanty, that we can scarcely venture to touch upon the subject\r\nat all. We would refer, however, to what Pausanias says of the warm\r\nsaline springs in the neighbourhood of the Asclepieion at Cenchreæ in\r\nCorinthiaca (ii, 2, 4), and of the springs near the temple of Æsculapius\r\nat Corone (iv, 34); and of the wells near the temple of Æsculapius at\r\nPergamos (viii. 25.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LIII.—ON THE REGIMEN FITTING TO THE DIFFERENT SEASONS.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to regulate the diet with a view to the season. In winter to\r\ntake more fatigue, and eat more than usual, if the state of the weather\r\nbe northerly; but if it be southerly, to take the same fatigue, but to\r\nuse less food and drink. In fine, to make the body dry in the wet season,\r\nand warmer in the cold, to eat also warm fleshes and acrid pot-herbs, and\r\ndrink more wine than usual. In the beginning of spring some may evacuate\r\nby emetics, and others by laxatives, and another may get a vein opened,\r\naccording as habit or inclination directs. Rest is suitable to the season\r\nof summer, and also a diminution of labour and food; the food also ought\r\nto be more cooling and the drink abundant; and, in short, everything\r\nought to be done which can contribute to cooling and dilution. In autumn,\r\nas it is a changeable, unsettled, and unhealthy season, the diet ought to\r\nbe particularly attended to, that it be not too refrigerant; moderation\r\nas to venery and cold drink ought to be observed; and the cold breezes\r\nof morning and the heat of noon attentively guarded against. Too much\r\nfruit ought likewise not to be taken, being hurtful not only by the\r\nquantity, but also by the quality of the chyle which it supplies, and\r\nby engendering flatulence. Nay, even the best kinds of autumnal fruits,\r\nfigs and grapes, engender flatulence, unless taken before any other\r\nfood, for otherwise they spoil the other food; but if taken then, they\r\nneither are flatulent, nor spoil the other articles of food. When the air\r\nis cold the body must be warmed accordingly, and everything done, as in\r\nthe commencement of winter. It may also be expedient, after the autumnal\r\nsolstice, to have recourse to one of the afore-mentioned evacuations,\r\nlest any excrementitious particles being shut up in the system should\r\nprove hurtful during the winter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is copied from Oribasius. (Euporist. i, 10.)\r\n\r\nIt is one of the aphorisms of Hippocrates that those who require\r\nbloodletting or medicine, should be bled or take medicine in the spring.\r\n(Aphor. sect. vi.) Galen, Rhases, Haly Abbas, and in short all the\r\nancient authorities agree with him respecting this rule of practice.\r\nAccording to Alsaharavius, the pulse is stronger and fuller in spring\r\nthan at any other season. (Theor. vii, 2.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates and Galen lay it down as a general rule that the fullest diet\r\nis most proper in winter, and the sparest in summer. (Aphor. i, 18.)\r\n\r\nRhases lays down very suitable directions for the regimen that is\r\nmost proper during every season of the year, but they are scarcely at\r\nall different from our author’s. As we have mentioned, he recommends\r\ndepletion in spring before the heat set in. In summer, he approves of\r\ncooling acid fruits with cold water for drink. In autumn he directs\r\nabstaining from cold baths, and the use of a restricted regimen. In\r\nwinter, he recommends a full proportion of calefacients, such as pepper,\r\ncumin, mustard, and rocket. (Ad Mansor. iv, 26.) Winter, he says in\r\nanother work, favours the formation of flesh and blood, braces the body,\r\nand strengthens the powers. Spring fills the system with humours. Summer\r\ndissolves the humours, and weakens the internal powers. Autumn engenders\r\nbad humours, bile, and blood. (Contin. xxxiv.)\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas recommends purging or bleeding in spring, to evacuate the\r\nsuperfluities formed and shut up in the system during winter. In summer,\r\nthe regimen is to be cooling and diluent; little exercise is to be taken;\r\nthe cold bath is to be used, swimming in cold water is to be practised:\r\nfor food, chickens, fish caught among rocks, grapes, apples, and the\r\nsummer fruits will be proper; but wine is either not to be drunk at\r\nall, or much diluted with water and cooled in snow; and venery is to be\r\navoided. In autumn, the regimen is to be cooling and desiccative, the\r\nexercise moderate, the cold bath is to be avoided, but the tepid is to be\r\ntaken, and much fruit is to be avoided. In winter, the regimen is to be\r\nheating and desiccative, and wine is to be taken moderately. The wine, he\r\nadds, ought to be strong and heating, to counteract the cold of winter;\r\nbut much must not be taken, because it will dilute and humectate the body\r\nwhich stands in need of desiccation. Wine, too, he says, possesses little\r\nnourishment, whereas the system requires much support in winter. He\r\nrecommends the flesh of quadrupeds and fowls for food. (Pract. i.) See,\r\nin like manner, Avicenna (i, 3, 5); Alsaharavius (Theor. ix, 2.)\r\n\r\nThe poet Hesiod recommends a full diet in winter. (Opera et Dies, l. 558.)\r\n\r\nMaximus Planudes, in a Declamation on winter, affirms that at this season\r\nthe heat, being confined within the body, operates more strongly in\r\nperforming the vital functions than at any other season. This season, he\r\nsays, is favorable to all classes of men except doctors; but they are\r\nsick at heart to see that no other persons are sick, and, bewailing their\r\nown misery, undergo the thirst of Tantalus amidst the rains of winter!\r\nSee Boissonade (Anecd. Græca, vol. ii.)\r\n\r\nAmong the works of the ‘Physici et Medici Græci Minores,’ published\r\na few years ago by Ideler, there are several small treatises, one by\r\nHierophilus Sophistes, in prose, one by Theodorus Prodromus in iambic\r\nverse, and two others, anonymous, in which the regimen adapted to every\r\nmonth of the year is carefully laid down, but the rules are too minute to\r\nadmit of being given here. We may mention, however, that they generally\r\nrecommend pork, with peppers, and pure wine, as the best course of diet\r\nin winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LIV.—OF THE REGIMEN OF PERSONS ACTIVELY EMPLOYED.\r\n\r\nHe who spends his time in business ought to consider whether, in the\r\nformer period of life, he had been in the habit of taking exercise, or\r\nwhether, though not taking exercise, he bears that habit well, and\r\nescapes from diseases by having free perspiration. Such a state of body\r\nis not to be suddenly changed to another habit, neither the mode of those\r\nwho have long been in ill health. But if constantly ill and plethoric,\r\nthe indication of cure ought to be by a healthful regimen, to supply\r\nmoderate nourishment; or, if cacochymy was the cause, the indication\r\nwill be to supply proper juices. Those who suffer from fulness are to be\r\ndirected when they go into the bath to use friction, and to take some\r\nexercise, or, if they have already done so, to increase it a little, but\r\nto detract from their food, and use less nutritious kinds than formerly;\r\nbut if from collections of bad humours, one indication of cure is not\r\nsufficient, because there is more than one kind of bad humours; for some\r\nhave a collection of cold and pituitous, some of hot and bilious, and\r\nothers of the melancholic. Every one, therefore, ought to avoid those\r\narticles of food and drink which are apt to engender that sort of humour\r\nwhich is collected. And in all these cases the common remedy is purging\r\nof the belly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is taken from Oribasius (Synops. v, 29), who extracts it\r\nfrom the ‘Commentaries’ of Galen. See also Rhases (Cont. xxxiii.) Galen\r\nand Rhases remark that persons who lead an active life, such as ploughmen\r\nand labourers, digest gross food more readily than any others; but that,\r\ntheir bodies being wasted by excessive fatigue, the vessels take up the\r\nchyle before it is properly concocted, and carry it over the system.\r\nHence, such persons seldom attain to an old age, as their bodies get\r\nloaded with improper juices.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LV.—ON THE REGIMEN OF TRAVELLERS.\r\n\r\nIn performing a journey, one will bear the fatigue best if anointed\r\nwith oil, and by not making too violent efforts; and by having the body\r\nabout the loins and to the hollow of the ribs, bound round, in summer,\r\nwith a swath of a soft consistence, six or seven fingers broad, and in\r\nlength not less than five cubits. A staff also is useful in a journey;\r\nfor in going down a declivity it serves as a pole to support the body\r\nfrom falling forwards, and by leaning upon it in ascending acclivities\r\nit will greatly assist in raising the body. When a traveller stops on a\r\njourney he should get his body anointed, take some food adapted for the\r\nsummer, and a moderate quantity of drink. After dinner he ought to rest\r\nawhile before proceeding. But if compelled to go on, and oppressed with\r\nthirst, water, having some polenta sprinkled upon it, with a moderate\r\nquantity of salt, will be of service to him. He should be careful of\r\nheat and of the sun, and have his body covered so as not to be exposed\r\nto the sun, lest, during the journey, his limbs become dry and stiff.\r\nWith these precautions, he will be less liable to lassitude, and all its\r\naccompanying evils. In winter, when it is cold, before setting out he\r\nought to evacuate, get his body rubbed with oil, and take plenty of the\r\nwinter articles of food, and a little drink. He should also get not only\r\nhis loins, but likewise his spine and chest, properly bound with a longer\r\nswath. When he stops, as sufficient coolness will be produced by the\r\nrelaxation, it will be better that he neither anoint, nor take food or\r\ndrink, nor any other refreshment, if he mean to remain there. But after\r\nlong journeys, or excessive fatigue of any kind, even if a person do not\r\ncomplain of lassitude, it will be proper to treat him like those who do,\r\nfor thereby there will be less danger of any bad consequences.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius (Synops. v, 31), who\r\nadmits that he borrows, in his turn, from Diocles. The directions are,\r\nupon the whole, very judicious and proper.\r\n\r\nGalen forbids travellers who have been exposed to great cold to take\r\nheating things immediately after a journey. (Meth. Med.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna, Averrhoes, and Haly Abbas direct a traveller to get bled\r\nbefore entering upon a journey; and, in certain cases, this might be a\r\nvery proper practice to prevent the blood from being inflamed by violent\r\nexercise, but, on the other hand, unless judiciously applied, it might\r\nbring on such debility as would render the traveller unable to undergo\r\nthe necessary fatigue. They recommend him to hold in his mouth a small\r\nball of the trochisk of camphor. The Arabians, it is to be recollected,\r\nmaintained that the action of camphor is frigorific. Instead of the\r\ndraught mentioned by our author, Avicenna recommends vinegar and water.\r\nHe recommends little food, but of good nourishment; and forbids pot-herbs\r\nand fruit. With regard to the treatment of the feet, they are to be\r\nrubbed until they become warm, and then anointed with hot fragrant oils.\r\nWhen the feet have suffered from cold, some, he says, put them into cold\r\nwater, and are thereby relieved, in like manner as congealed fruits are\r\nsometimes restored. When the water for drink is bad, he advises to get it\r\ndistilled.\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas gives very minute directions for the conduct of travellers.\r\nLike our author, he advises them to gird the body with a swath or band,\r\nand to use a staff. He forbids them to begin a journey either fasting,\r\nor in a state of repletion with food. Exposure to the sun, he says, is\r\napt to occasion hectic fevers, headach, consumption, and dryness of the\r\nbody. He directs them to have the head covered. When hurt by exposure to\r\nheat, he advises cold water, or any other thing of a cooling nature to be\r\npoured over the head. After exposure to cold, he recommends the hot bath.\r\n(Pract. i, 31.)\r\n\r\nRhases remarks that he had known all persons who had been exposed to\r\ngreat heat during a journey suffer from attacks of fever, except those of\r\na humid and phlegmatic temperament. He forbids much food before setting\r\nout on a journey, and even approves of getting bled and purged, if the\r\nundertaking be severe. He recommends, if convenient, a bath at the close\r\nof the day; then the traveller is to eat and go to sleep. He and all the\r\nauthorities quoted by him direct the body to be rubbed with oil before\r\nand after a journey. To preserve the eyes from the effects of snow and\r\ndust, he recommends them to be exposed to the vapours produced by pouring\r\nwine on a heated stone, or to those of chamomile, dill, or marjoram.\r\nTo protect the feet, he directs them to be wrapped in cloths smeared\r\nwith calefacient oils. When very hot, he cautions against swallowing\r\nmuch cold water at once, but recommends some cool liquid to be held\r\nin the mouth, and cold water to be poured on the hands and feet. He\r\nrecommends travellers to chew pickled onions. During the prevalence of\r\nextreme cold he approves of drinking some hot wine before setting out\r\non a journey. When the journey is over, he directs the traveller to go\r\ninto a comfortable apartment, but not to approach the fire, nor enter\r\nthe bath, nor allow himself to sleep during the space of an hour. After\r\nthis he may go into the bath, and undergo friction until his body become\r\nruddy, and then he may go to sleep on a soft bed; by which regimen he may\r\nbe preserved from fever, if such be the will of God.

LVI.—OF THE REGIMEN OF PERSONS ON BOARD SHIP.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the vomitings which occur to people at sea, it is neither\r\neasy nor expedient to contend with those which happen first; for, upon\r\nthe whole, they are generally beneficial. After vomiting, one ought not\r\nto partake of much nor of ordinary food, but either lentils, dried and\r\nboiled with a small quantity of pennyroyal, or bread pounded in a weak\r\nand fragrant wine. One ought also to use but little drink, and that\r\ncontaining a weak watery wine, or vinegar with honey. The lentils ought\r\nto be first boiled, and then when they become soft, to be triturated, and\r\nafterwards dried and put into an earthen vessel. When severe vomiting\r\nlasts for a long time, one should resolutely abstain from all kinds of\r\nfood, and take only a little drink, which ought to be vinegar and honey\r\nwith water, containing thyme infused in it, or pennyroyal water with\r\nsome fine polenta, or some fragrant weak wine with fine polenta also. In\r\norder to overcome the disagreeable stench on board ships, one may smell\r\nto quinces, thyme, or pennyroyal. One ought also to look as seldom as\r\npossible upon the sea, until one has been accustomed to live in a ship.\r\nOne must likewise attend, that the water which is drunk be not muddy,\r\nill-smelled, or saltish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section likewise is taken from Oribasius (Synop. v,\r\n33), who copies from Diocles. Similar directions are given by Rhases,\r\nAvicenna, and Haly Abbas. Haly remarks that persons on board of a\r\nship are often infested with lice, which are engendered by want of\r\ncleanliness. For them he recommends mercury killed, with oil, the long\r\nbithwort, &c. (Pract. i, 31.) Avicenna says that, by wearing wool smeared\r\nwith oil and mercury, the lice will be killed. (Cant. p. ii.)\r\n\r\nWhen the vomiting is unusually severe and protracted, Rhases recommends\r\nit to be treated with anti-bilious remedies. (Ad Mansor. vi, 14, Contin.\r\n34.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LVII.—ON THE MEANS OF DIMINISHING OBESITY.\r\n\r\nWhen the body gets to an immoderate degree of obesity, it will be\r\nnecessary to melt it down and reduce it. It was mentioned formerly that\r\nthe warm temperament renders the body lean, and therefore it ought to be\r\nsuperinduced, if possible, upon that of fat people, in order to reduce\r\nthem to the proper state. You have also learned that active exercise,\r\nan attenuant regimen, medicines of the same class, and mental anxiety,\r\nbring on the dry temperament, and thereby render the body lean. What an\r\nattenuant diet consists of is perfectly obvious; but the more powerful\r\nmedicines, such as the seed of rue, particularly the wild, with its\r\ntops, the round birthwort (_aristolochia rotunda_), the small centaury,\r\ngentian, poley, and the stronger diuretic medicines, as Macedonian\r\nparsley: all such medicines, either alone, or together, attenuate the\r\nhumours, and evacuate the body. The salts also from burned vipers\r\nand the theriac attenuate the body. The body may also be reduced and\r\nattenuated, by having an oil rubbed into it, containing the root of\r\nthe wild cucumber, marshmallows, gentian, and the root of the all-heal\r\nand birthwort, or the poley and centaury. One ought not to take food\r\nimmediately after the bath, but should first sleep for a little time.\r\nAnd it will be better if the water of the bath possess diaphoretic\r\nproperties, and, more particularly, if we can have recourse to a natural\r\none, such as that in Mitylene. If it cannot be procured, the flower of\r\nsalt may be mixed with sea water. Thin white wines ought to be used. Dry\r\nrubbing with thick towels is calculated to reduce the fat. A smaller\r\nquantity of food ought to be given in proportion to the exercise taken.\r\nInsolation also is of use for obesity. Fat persons ought not to take a\r\nfragrant draught before a meal; and it will be best if they eat only\r\nonce in the day. The body ought to be rubbed with nitre (soda), and the\r\nrougher salts. A large quantity of nitre in the bath is attenuant, but a\r\nsmall quantity only stimulates to nourishment. The following mixture is\r\nattenuant: Of pepper and Macedonian parsley, two parts, of asarabacca and\r\nanise, one half. This acts well, both as a diuretic and a cathartic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 40.) Aëtius uses\r\nnearly the same words. (iv, 32.) Celsus recommends the tepid salt-water\r\nbath, hard exercise, food of an acid or austere kind, and restricted\r\nsleep. (i, 3.)\r\n\r\nGalen gives an interesting account of the manner in which he cured a\r\nperson of obesity in a very short space of time. He says, “I first made\r\nhim take quick exercise, and afterwards wiped off the sweat with a\r\nlinen cloth. I then rubbed his body with the volatile ointments called\r\nacopa, and after this friction I led him to the bath. I did not then\r\ngive him food at once, but directed him either to rest, or to follow any\r\noccupation he was inclined for, and then repeated the bath; after which\r\nI gave him as much food, not of a very nourishing description, as he was\r\ndisposed to take.” (De Sanit. tuendâ, vi, 8.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna recommends hard exercise and frequent baths, and vinegar to\r\ndrink. (i, 3, 4.) Rhases recommends fat persons to abstain from animal\r\nfood, wine, milk, and all sweet things; to live upon pot-herbs, and such\r\nthings as are saltish and sour; to take purgatives and diuretics, to use\r\nmuch hard exercise, and to remain long in the bath. (Ad Mansor. v, 61.)\r\nIn another work he treats of this subject at great length. He recommends\r\nacids, and especially vinegar. In short, he agrees with Galen, that all\r\nthings of a bitter, sour, and attenuant nature reduce obesity; and also\r\nthat saltish things which have the property of opening the bowels do the\r\nsame. Nothing, he says, tends more to reduce corpulency than frequent\r\nbaths and hard friction. (Contin. iv.)\r\n\r\nThe directions given by Haly Abbas are to the same effect as those of\r\nRhases, that is to say, he recommends fat persons to take hard exercise,\r\nto remain long in the bath, to use friction with oil of dill and the\r\nlike, to live upon articles of food not too nutritious, not to indulge in\r\nprotracted sleep, and to have frequent recourse to laxative and purgative\r\nmedicines. (Pract. i, 16.)\r\n\r\nSome remarkable cases of obesity are related by Athenæus. (Deipnos, xii,\r\n12.)\r\n\r\nThe practice of the Methodists is described in a very circumstantial\r\nmanner by Cælius Aurelianus. (Tard. Pass. v, 9.) They very properly\r\ncondemned bleeding and purging, and depended principally upon strong\r\nexercise, hot baths, insolation, the sand-bath, hard friction, and a\r\nrestricted diet.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LVIII.—HOW TO RECRUIT THOSE WHO ARE EMACIATED.\r\n\r\nWhen we wish to recruit those who are reduced in flesh, we must give them\r\nthick wine and food containing thick juices, and prescribe slow exercise\r\nand moderate friction,—in a word, every thing contrary to the method we\r\nhave been just describing. It may also be of use to be pitched for three\r\nor four days. If a person go into the bath with an empty stomach, he\r\nought beforehand to get his body rubbed with linen cloths until it become\r\nruddy, and afterwards, by hard but not frequent friction, the skin may be\r\nrendered thick and hard. Those who are pale, and not properly nourished,\r\nought to be roused to anger and mental emotions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is either copied from Oribasius (Synops. v, 41), or\r\nfrom Aëtius (iv, 58.) The process of pitching the body is thus described\r\nby Aëtius: “Dried pitch is melted in a moderate quantity of oil, and,\r\nwhile still warm, is to be rubbed into the skin (the part having been\r\npreviously shaved), and before it cools completely it is to be torn away.\r\nThe plaster is to be again heated at the fire, and spread upon the skin;\r\nand before it becomes cold it is to be torn away. This process is to be\r\nfrequently repeated.” (iii, 180.) See Celsus (i, 3.)\r\n\r\nGalen, in his Commentary on the second Aphorism of Hippocrates,\r\nexpresses himself strongly on the danger of using precipitation in\r\nrecruiting a person that has been emaciated. He evidently writes from\r\nample experience, acquired in training the Athletæ. Hippocrates and his\r\ncommentator repeat this rule the “ne quid nimis” in another place. See\r\nGalen (Op. t. v, 251, ed. Basil.)\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas recommends moderate exercise, a short continuance in the bath,\r\nfriction with emollient oils, much sleep, two or three meals every day,\r\nfood consisting of fat meat, bread, almonds, &c. He also approves of\r\npitching. (Pract. i, 16.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna recommends pitching, the bath soon after taking food, soft\r\nfriction, and the rest of the treatment recommended by Paulus. (i, 3, 4.)\r\n\r\nRhases treats of the same at great length. He approves of protracted\r\nsleep; of food consisting of fat meat, wheat, and pulse; after food,\r\nof the bath, friction with oil, and the affusion of tepid water over\r\nthe body; and also of red, thick, and sweet wines. (Ad Mansor. v, 60.)\r\nIn another work he delivers the opinions of preceding authorities,\r\naccompanied with his own remarks. He agrees with Galen, that emaciation\r\ngenerally depends upon the state of the liver. They recommend nutritive\r\narticles of food, such as boiled and roasted flesh, and the bath, without\r\nfriction, after a meal. Both speak favorably of pitching. They also\r\napprove particularly of sulphureous and bituminous baths. With regard\r\nto the bath, they explain, in another place, that it is proper in these\r\ncases only after the food is digested; for, if taken too soon after, it\r\nloads the body with unconcocted chyle; and that, if had recourse to at\r\nother times, it rather induces emaciation. Rhases again repeats that\r\nmany of the legumina are very nutritive. He states that the wine should\r\nbe particularly thick. (Contin. xiv.) Galen further says, that emaciated\r\npersons are to be recruited by thick wines, food consisting of thick\r\njuices, short exercises, and moderate friction. (Meth. Med. xiv, 16.) In\r\nanother place he gives a very striking description of the bad effects\r\nof inanition. (De Venesect. adv. Erasistrat.) We would further direct\r\nattention to the description given by Hippocrates of a febrile state of\r\nthe system, attended with delirium, which is sometimes brought on by too\r\nrestricted a regimen in disease. (De Diæta morb. acut. § 11.)\r\n\r\nOn the treatment of convalescents, consult Celsus (iv, 25); Galen\r\n(Hyg.); and particularly Rhases (Contin. xxxiv). We shall give Celsus’\r\ndirections in his own words: “Ex quocunque autem morbo quis convalescit,\r\nsi tarde confirmatur, vigilare primâ luce debet; nihilominus in lecto\r\nconquiescere: circa tertiam horam leniter unctis manibus corpus\r\npermulcere: deinde delectationis causa, quantum juvat, ambulare,\r\ncircumcisa omni negotiosa actione: tum gestari diu: multa frictione uti:\r\nloca, cœlum, cibos sæpe mutare: ubi triduo quatriduove vinum bibit,\r\nuno aut etiam altero die interponere aquam. Per hæc enim fiet, ne in\r\nvitia tabem inferentia incidat, et ut mature vires suas recipiat. Cum\r\nvero ex toto convaluerit, periculosè vitæ genus subito mutabit, et\r\ninordinatè aget. Paulatim ergo debebit, omissis his legibus, eo transire,\r\nut arbitrio suo vivat.” Galen and Rhases particularly recommend to\r\nconvalescents to drink white astringent wines diluted with water. Both\r\nenjoin a restricted diet at first, gentle exercise, and the bath in\r\nmoderation. Haly Abbas cautions against premature friction and exercise,\r\nbut recommends the tepid bath, and gentle unction with oils. (Pract.\r\ni, 25.) Syrasis recommends the warm bath, moderate friction with rough\r\ntowels, and unction with a little oil. (Auctores de Balneis, p. 334.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LIX.—HOW TO REMEDY EMACIATED PARTS OF THE BODY.\r\n\r\nWhen emaciation takes place in any part of the body, it is commonly\r\noccasioned by long-protracted rest, or by bandaging for fractures. We\r\nmust, therefore, stimulate their vital powers, and attract the blood to\r\nthem, by using moderate friction, suitable exercise, and by the affusion\r\nof warm water upon them in moderate quantity. This must be done until\r\nthe part becomes red and swells, and we must desist before it subsides.\r\nWe must also use pitching, as formerly described. When there is a\r\nsense of cold in the part, it ought to be rubbed with linen cloths, or\r\nsome calefacient medicine. For this purpose, I have sometimes used the\r\nthapsia, rubbing it in either with honey or cerate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is taken from Oribasius (Synops. v, 42), or Aëtius\r\n(iv, 34). See also Galen (de Sanit. tuendâ, v); Rhases (Contin. xiii);\r\nHaly Abbas (Pract. i, 16); Avicenna (i, 3, 4.) All recommend water to\r\nbe poured on the part, and then it is to be rubbed with towels and hot\r\nstimulant oils, so as to produce a redness and glow in it. Most of them\r\nalso approve of the pitch plaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LX.—THE DIAGNOSIS OF THE BEST TEMPERAMENT.\r\n\r\nThat man is in the best temperament of body when it is in a medium\r\nbetween all extremes, of leanness and obesity, of softness and hardness,\r\nof heat and cold, of moisture and dryness; and, in a word, who has all\r\nthe natural and vital energies in a faultless state. His hair, also,\r\nshould be neither thick nor thin, and in colour neither black nor white.\r\nWhen a boy, his locks should be rather tawny than black, but, when an\r\nadult, the contrariwise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is copied from Oribasius (Synops. v, 43), or\r\nAëtius (iv, 53). See also Galen (de Temperam., de Opt. Corp. Constit.,\r\nde Sanit. tuendâ, v, and Ars Med.) In the last mentioned, which was\r\nlong the most celebrated of all his admired works, he has treated of\r\nthe temperaments very systematically. Whatever Oribasius, Paulus, or\r\nany subsequent author, whether Greek or Arabian, have delivered on this\r\nsubject is altogether derived from the works of Galen.\r\n\r\nNone of the Arabians has treated of the temperaments so learnedly as Haly\r\nAbbas. (Theor. i.) See also Averrhoes (Collig. vi); Alsaharavius (Theor.\r\nvi); Avicenna (Cant.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXI.—DIAGNOSIS OF THE TEMPERAMENTS.\r\n\r\nThose bodies which are of a hotter temperament than the moderate will\r\nhave their teeth earlier than usual, and will grow in like manner. They\r\nfeel warmer to the touch, and have less fat; they are of a ruddy colour,\r\nhave their hair black and moderately thick, and their veins are large.\r\nBut if such a one be also fat and brawny, and have large veins, he is fat\r\nfrom habit and not from nature. The following are the marks of a cold\r\ntemperament: Such bodies appear cold to the touch, are without hair, and\r\nare fat; their complexion, like their hair, being tawny. But when the\r\ncoldness is great, they are pale, leaden-coloured, and have small veins;\r\nand if lean, this does not proceed from nature, but habit. The dry is\r\nharder and more slender than the temperate—the hardness, indeed, being\r\ninseparable from the dry temperament; but leanness not only follows the\r\ncongenital temperaments, but also those which are acquired by long habit.\r\nIt is a mark of hardness when the body is rendered unapt for motion, dry\r\nand parched, by drying applications. The humid, in all other respects,\r\nis like the temperate, but is softer and fatter, and the softness is\r\ninseparable from it; but the grossness not only follows the connate\r\ntemperament, but also that acquired by long habit. It is peculiar to\r\nthe humid temperament that the body is oppressed by things of a moist\r\nnature. The warm and dry temperament is extremely shaggy, having the\r\nhair of the head in early age of rapid growth, black, and thick; but, in\r\nafter-life, baldness follows. The veins are large, as are likewise the\r\narteries, which beat strongly. The whole body is firm, well articulated,\r\nmuscular, and without obesity; and the skin is hard and dark. When the\r\ntemperament is cold and humid, the chest is narrow, and, like the rest\r\nof the body, without hairs; the skin is soft and white, and its hairs\r\nsomewhat tawny, especially in youth; and such persons do not get bald\r\nwhen they grow old; they are timid, spiritless, and inactive; their\r\nveins are invisible; they are gross and fat; their muscles and legs are\r\nfeeble, and their joints ill-formed; and they are bandy-legged. But\r\nshould the humidity and coldness increase, the colour of their skin and\r\nhair becomes tawny, or, if they increase still more, pale. The hot and\r\nhumid temperament is softer and more fleshy than the best temperament,\r\nand, when it increases much, is subject to putrid disorders; but, if it\r\nbe only a little more humid and much hotter than the moderate, the bodies\r\nof such persons are only a little more soft and fleshy than the moderate,\r\nbut they are much more hairy and hotter to the touch. But if the cold and\r\nthe dry grow equally together, such persons have naturally their bodies\r\nhard, slender, and white, with fine muscles, small joints, and little\r\nhair; and they are cold to the touch. Although slender, fat is mixed with\r\ntheir flesh. The colour of their hair is correspondent to the degree of\r\nconstitutional coldness. As to disposition of mind, they are spiritless,\r\ntimid, and desponding. To say all in a word, with regard to the compound\r\ntemperaments, they are always to be distinguished by the marks of the\r\nprevailing quality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius (Synops. v, 44), who\r\nborrows from Galen (Ars Med. c. 15.) See also all the authorities\r\nreferred to in the preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nThe ancients, it will be perceived, connected the passions and desires of\r\nthe mind with the temperaments; and, to establish the alliance between\r\nthem, Galen wrote a treatise, wherein he has handled the subject very\r\ningeniously, and has delivered many profound views of the animal economy.\r\nGalen’s work, to which we allude, is entitled, ‘Quod Animi Mores Corporis\r\nTemperamenta sequuntur.’\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXII.—ON THE FORM OF THE HEAD.\r\n\r\nA small head is the peculiar mark of a faulty configuration of the\r\nbrain, but a large is not necessarily a good one; for if occasioned by\r\nthe strength of the vital powers of the part fabricating an abundant and\r\nproper material, it is a good sign; but if occasioned by the quantity\r\nof matter alone, it is not good. We must judge of heads then from their\r\nshape, and from the processes which arise from them: from their shape,\r\nif well formed, for that is always a good sign; and from the processes\r\nof the brain, if they be in their proper state, and if the nervous parts\r\nbe all properly nourished, have their suitable tone, and if the sight\r\nbe acute. Sharp heads are defective in the protuberance of the front or\r\nhind-head, or else it is unnaturally increased. Now, in most cases we\r\nshall find that these last, like the large, are faulty, and yet some of\r\nthem, though rarely, are good, the formative principle being strong.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius (Synops. v, 45); Aëtius\r\n(iv, 63); or direct from Galen (Ars Med. c. 6.)\r\n\r\nPsellus, like our author, remarks, that a small head, by contracting\r\nand binding, as it were, the brain, is necessarily a bad formation;\r\nwhilst a large head, if it arises from excess of the natural powers, is\r\ngood; but if it is occasioned by a collection of superfluous matter, the\r\ncontrary. We would refer, in this place, to the curious account of the\r\n_Macrocephali_ given by Hippocrates in his treatise ‘On Airs,’ &c. (§\r\n14), and to the interesting remarks in the same by M. Littré (t. iv, p.\r\nxi.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXIII.—THE MARKS OF THE TEMPERAMENT OF THE BRAIN.\r\n\r\nA brain of the proper temperament has its vital energies and excretions\r\nmoderate, and is not liable to be affected by any externals. Such\r\npersons, when infants, have the hair of their head somewhat tawny—when\r\nboys, yellowish—and when adults, a bright yellow; being also intermediate\r\nbetween the curly and the straight, and they do not readily fall out.\r\nWhen the temperament is hotter than moderate, all the parts about the\r\nhead are hotter and redder, the veins in their eyes are perceptible,\r\ntheir hair is grown at birth; and if much hotter, it is black, strong,\r\nand curly; but if not much, it is yellowish at first, and then grows\r\nblack, and in more advanced life such persons become bald; their\r\nexcretions are small when they enjoy good health; their head becomes\r\nfilled and oppressed by heating food, drink, and odours, or by any\r\nexternal casualties. Such temperaments are satisfied with little sleep,\r\nand even that is generally not profound. The following are the marks of\r\na brain which is colder than proper: The excretions are excessive; the\r\nhairs are straight, yellow, and durable; and it is hurt readily by cold\r\nthings. Such persons are constantly seized with catarrhs and defluxions,\r\nthe veins of their eyes are not visible, and they are much given to\r\ndrowsiness. The following are the marks of a brain which is drier than\r\nnatural: In the excretions nothing redundant, the senses acute, not being\r\ngiven to drowsiness, the hair strong and soon formed, rather curly, and\r\nsoon falling out. In the more humid temperament, the hairs are straight,\r\ndo not readily drop out; the senses are muddy, and the excretions\r\nredundant, sleep long and profound. In the compound of the hot and dry,\r\nthe excretions of the head are small, the senses acute, there is a\r\ndisposition to watchfulness, and baldness. Their hair at first is formed\r\nquickly and abundantly, is of a black colour, hot to the touch, and they\r\nare ruddy until manhood. But if moisture be joined to heat, and they are\r\nnot immoderate, the colour and heat are good, and the veins of the eyes\r\nlarge. The excretions are plenteous and moderately concocted. The hair\r\nis straight and yellowish, and does not readily drop out. The head is\r\neasily filled and oppressed by heating and moistening things. But should\r\nan increase of humidity and heat take place, the head becomes diseased,\r\nand easily affected by heating and diluent things. Such persons cannot\r\nendure long watchfulness, but their sleep is disturbed by fantastical\r\ndreams, their sight is dim, and their senses not distinct. The cold and\r\ndry temperaments of the brain conjoined together render the head cold and\r\npale, the veins of their eyes do not appear, and they are readily hurt\r\nby cold things: wherefore, their health is precarious. Their senses in\r\nyouth are distinct and faultless, but as they advance in life soon decay.\r\nIn a word, as far as regards the head, they experience a premature old\r\nage; their hair after birth is of slow growth, stunted, and tawny. The\r\nhumid and cold temperaments of the brain render those affected with them\r\nprone to lethargy and drowsiness; their senses are bad; they abound with\r\nrecrementitious humours; are easily affected with cold and fulness of the\r\nhead; and are liable to catarrhs and defluxions; but such persons do not\r\nreadily become bald.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is taken from Oribasius (Synops. v, 46), who abridges\r\nGalen. (Ars Med.)\r\n\r\nAs our author’s description of the temperaments is sufficiently\r\nintelligible, and the others, whether Greeks or Arabians, deliver exactly\r\nthe same views of the subject, without any material improvement, we\r\nconsider it unnecessary to multiply references to, and extracts from\r\nthem, on the present occasion; and, therefore, instead of crowding our\r\npages with superfluous repetitions, we shall give in this, and the five\r\nfollowing Sections, a brief exposition of the physiological doctrines of\r\nthe ancients, with regard to the principal organs of the human body:\r\n\r\nThe ancients divided the powers or faculties of the human body into the\r\nNatural, the Vital, and the Animal. The brain they held to be the seat\r\nof the animal powers—that is to say, they considered it to be the organ\r\nfrom which sensation and motion are derived, and these, they maintained,\r\nare the powers by which animals are distinguished from vegetables. This\r\ndoctrine is fully explained by Galen, in his work, ‘De Facultatibus\r\nNaturalibus,’ and by several of the Arabian authors, among whom we will\r\nventure to mention Haly Abbas, as being particularly worthy of being\r\nconsulted on this subject. The brain, then, was accounted the seat of the\r\nfive external senses, and of muscular motion, which also was reckoned as\r\none of the senses by Hippocrates. (De Insomniis, c. 1.) Galen and his\r\nfollowers decidedly taught that the nerves of the senses are distinct\r\nfrom those which impart the power of motion, that the former derive their\r\norigin from the anterior part of the brain or cerebrum, and the latter\r\nfrom the posterior, called by the Greeks encephalis (under this term they\r\ncomprehended the cerebellum, tuber annulare, and medulla oblongata of\r\nmodern anatomists), or from its process, the spinal cord. They maintained\r\nthat the nerves of the finer senses are formed of matter too soft to be\r\nthe vehicles of muscular motion; whereas, on the other hand, the nerves\r\nof motion are too hard to be susceptible of fine sensibility. See Galen\r\n(de Usu Partium, ix; de Administ. Anat. vii); Haly Abbas (Theor. iv);\r\nAverrhoes (Collig. iii, 33); Avenzoar (ii, 7); and Rhases (Contin. i.)\r\n\r\nThe ancients were also of opinion that the brain is the coldest viscus\r\nin the animal frame, being in this respect the antagonist of the heart,\r\nthe heat of which they supposed that it counteracts. See Aristot. (De\r\nPart. Anim. ii, 7); and Pliny (Hist. Nat. xi, 49.) There appears to be\r\nsome foundation for this opinion, since, as is remarked by Haly Abbas,\r\nthose parts of the body which are vascular, and contain much blood, are\r\nnaturally hot; whereas such as contain little blood are comparatively\r\ncold. Of this latter class are the brain, nerves, and fat. (Theor. i.)\r\n\r\nThe later Greek authorities, as, for example, Theophilus Protospatharius\r\nand Nemesius, adopt a division of the brain as regards its connexion with\r\nmind, to which Galen and his immediate followers appear to have been\r\nstrangers. According to it, Fantasy is connected with the anterior part\r\nof the brain; Cogitation, or the _discursus mentis_, with the middle; and\r\nMemory with the posterior. See, in particular, Theophilus (p. 184, ed.\r\nGreenhill.) This hypothesis was received by all the Arabian writers on\r\nmedicine. See, for example, Averrhoes (Collig. ii, 20.) It was evidently\r\nan approach to the arrangement adopted by the phrenologists of the\r\npresent day, who maintain that intellect is seated in the anterior part\r\nof the brain; the moral feelings in the middle; and the animal appetites\r\nin the posterior.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXIV.—THE MARKS OF THE TEMPERAMENTS OF THE STOMACH.\r\n\r\nThe marks of a preternatural dryness of the stomach are, that those\r\naffected with it are liable to thirst, but little drink satisfies them;\r\nand they feel heavy with much drink, as the superfluity occasions\r\ngurgling in the stomach, or floats upon it; of those of a more humid,\r\nthat they are not addicted to thirst, and bear readily much liquids,\r\nand rejoice in humid food. A stomach preternaturally hot has a better\r\ndigestion than appetite, particularly with regard to those things which\r\nare hard and difficult to digest; it delights in much food and drink;\r\nneither is it hurt by the moderate use of cold things. A preternaturally\r\ncold stomach has a good appetite but not a good digestion, in particular\r\nwith regard to such things as are of difficult digestion, and are of a\r\ncold nature, which therefore are apt to turn acid in it. And it delights\r\nindeed in cold things, but is readily hurt by the immoderate use of them.\r\nThe intemperaments proceeding from disease differ from the congenital\r\nin this, that they long for opposite things, and not always alike. If\r\nthe stomach then digests properly, it is of a moderate temperament; and\r\nif it does not it is of a bad; but if its eructations are fetid, its\r\nheat is inordinate and inflammatory; but if acid, the contrary. And in\r\nthose who digest properly things of difficult digestion, the heat of the\r\nstomach is inordinate, and weak in those who cannot digest those things,\r\nbut digest fishes. It must also be observed, whether or not the symptom\r\nis occasioned by any humour flowing from another part; for in pituitous\r\nconstitutions acid eructations are apt to occur; but in the bilious,\r\nfetid airs and other disagreeable qualities are apt to prevail. The\r\ncommon symptom of them all is nausea. If the depraved humours swim within\r\nthe cavity of the stomach, they float on the surface, and are discharged\r\nby vomiting; but if they are contained in the substance of it within its\r\ncoats, they annoy it with vain attempts to vomit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We shall now state briefly the opinions of the ancients with\r\nregard to the functional office of the stomach.\r\n\r\nActuarius says, “I am of opinion, that there are four species of\r\nconcoction which are performed in different parts of the body: the first\r\nin the stomach; the second in the vena ramalis (vena portæ?), meseraic\r\nveins, and concave part of the liver; the third in the convex part of\r\nthe liver and veins proceeding from it; and the fourth, consisting of\r\nfabrication or assimilation, which takes place in the extreme parts of\r\nthe body.” (De Urinis.) The various modes of change or concoction which\r\nthe food undergoes in the body, are minutely described by Macrobius.\r\n(Saturnal. vii.) In another place, Actuarius says, “Digestion is\r\nperformed by moderate heat and moisture.” (De Spiritu Animali, p. ii,\r\ns. 1.) Alsaharavius in like manner states, that the digestive faculty\r\ndepends partly on the heat, and partly on the humidity of the stomach.\r\n(Pract. tr. xvi, c. 1.) It is impossible not to see that the gastric\r\njuice is alluded to in these passages. It is particularly stated of\r\nAsclepiades, that he held digestion to be the solution of the food. See\r\nC. Aurelianus. (Morb. Acut. i, 14.) And that the ancients were aware\r\nthat the stomach secretes a fluid possessed of solvent properties, is\r\nput beyond a doubt, by the following extract from the works of Haly\r\nAbbas. Speaking of the changes which the food undergoes in the mouth and\r\nstomach, he says: “Immutantur cibi in ore, retinenturque, et flegmati\r\nadmiscetur quod digestum est, calorque ei datur. Quod autem flegma hoc\r\nhujusmodi sit, signum nobis est quod impetigines et sarpedones curat,\r\nquædam maturat ulcera, scorpiones necat. Hac ergo de causa et in ore\r\ncibus immutatur. Sic et stomachus ipsum immutat: ejus etenim circum\r\namplectitur substantia, quasque habet imprimit qualitates, immutaturque\r\nipsius naturali calore cibus: _Sed et quoniam cibus ipse in eo flegmati\r\nadmiscetur humido._” (Theor. iv, 3.) The whole bearing of this passage,\r\nbut more especially the last clause, puts it beyond a doubt that the\r\nprocess of digestion was supposed to be performed, in a certain measure,\r\nby the solvent powers of a fluid secreted in the stomach. And the\r\ningenious Alexander Aphrodisiensis, in like manner, treating of the\r\ndigestion of mustard, pepper, and other acrid substances, says decidedly,\r\nthat their acrimony is dissolved in the copious fluid of the stomach.\r\n(Probl. i, 30.) See also Macrobius (Saturnal. vii, 8.) He calls the fluid\r\nventralis humor, which may be literally translated, “gastric juice.” Part\r\nof the process was, no doubt, supposed to be performed indirectly by\r\nheat; and deservedly, for even Spallanzani was compelled to admit, that\r\nthe comparative temperature of animals exerts a considerable influence\r\non their digestive powers. Hence, as was stated by Averrhoes, and as\r\nis confirmed by Cuvier, Birds, which are the warmest class of animals,\r\nlikewise digest the fastest. At all events, the ancients were well aware,\r\nthat digestion is not a mechanical, but a vital process, being performed\r\nby the principle of life. “Digestion,” says Averrhoes, “is performed by\r\nconcoction, and the concoction is influenced by heat, not that the first\r\nmover in the operation is heat, but the nutritive soul; because the\r\noperations of heat are indeterminate, and not directed to any manifest\r\nend.” (Collig. v, 3.) In the ‘Averroeana’ or ‘Letters from Averrhoes\r\nto Metrodorus,’ (which, whether genuine or not, contain a curious and\r\ninteresting exposition of the _Great Commentator’s_ opinions on various\r\nsubjects, and at all events must be of considerable antiquity,) the\r\ndoctrine of a gastric menstruum is discussed with singular ability.\r\nMetrodorus states, that “he found, by the writings of the physicians and\r\nphilosophers of these times, that they make the _menstruum_, as they\r\ncall it, whereby both appetite is provoked, and food in the stomach is\r\ndigested, to be a certain juice or humour in the stomach,” &c. Averrhoes\r\ndenies that this menstruum acts by its acidity alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXV.—DIAGNOSIS OF THE TEMPERAMENTS OF THE LUNGS.\r\n\r\nNot only does the stomach render us thirsty and otherwise, and excite a\r\ndesire of warm and cold drink, but also the thoracic viscera, namely,\r\nthe heart and lungs, and likewise the liver. And drinking does not\r\nstraightway allay the desire, but a small quantity of cold drink\r\nwill rather allay the thirst than a great quantity of warm. Persons\r\nso affected are refreshed by inhaling cold air, which has no effect\r\nin alleviating the thirst of the stomach. Thus, also, those who are\r\ncontrariwise affected, suffer sensibly from breathing cold air; this\r\nis the strongest mark of coldness of the lungs; but they also hawk up\r\nphlegm, and expectorate it with coughing. Dryness of the lungs is marked\r\nby freedom from excrementitious discharges and from phlegm; and humidity,\r\nby being excrementitious, and rendering the voice dull and hoarse; and\r\nthe recrementitious discharge is also very great when they attempt to\r\nspeak in a louder or sharper tone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The ancients were of opinion, that the lungs are an\r\naccessory organ, made to administer to the heart. “It is the heart,”\r\nsays Aretæus, “which imparts to the lungs the desire of drawing in\r\ncold air.” And in like manner, Theophilus holds that the other organs\r\nof respiration were made for the sake of the heart, in order that its\r\ninnate heat may be cooled, increased, and nourished. (De Fabrica Hominis,\r\np. 89, ed. Greenhill.) The physiologists differed respecting the uses\r\nof respiration. Thus, according to Galen, the famous Asclepiades held\r\nthat it is for the generation of the soul itself, breath and life being\r\nthus considered to be identical; Philistion, Diocles, and Aristotle,\r\nfor the ventilation of the innate heat; Hippocrates for its nutrition\r\nand refrigeration; and Erasistratus for the filling of the arteries\r\nwith spirits. All these opinions are discussed and commented upon by\r\nGalen, who determines the purposes of respiration to be twofold: first,\r\nto preserve the animal heat; and second, to evacuate the fuliginous\r\nportion of the blood. He was aware of the analogy between respiration\r\nand combustion, and comes to the conclusion that they are processes of a\r\nsimilar nature: he accordingly compares the lungs to a lamp, the heart to\r\nits wick, the blood to the oil, and the animal heat to the flame. (Galen,\r\nde usu Respir.) Aristotle gives the name of pneuma to the vital heat of\r\nanimals, and ascribes the source and maintenance of it to the double\r\nfunctions of respiration and digestion. (De Pneumate.) See further, Third\r\nBook, s. 27.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from Alexander Aphrodisiensis will explain\r\nthe opinions entertained by physicians and _savans_ of a later age:\r\n“Wherefore there is a natural tepidity, the same I mean as the innate\r\nheat, whence springs the origin of the animal, its nature; for it is\r\ncongenital with the animal, and therefore is called natural, being in the\r\nmain the instrument of the soul’s powers.” (De Feb. viii.)\r\n\r\nThe following extract from Haly will show that the opinions of the\r\nArabians on this subject did not differ from those of their Grecian\r\nmasters, and more especially of Galen: “Respiration is necessary, for the\r\nsake of the heart, which is the fountain, and, as it were, the focus of\r\nvital heat, whence it is diffused over the rest of the body. It requires\r\nsome aerial substance to ventilate the heat and ebullition of the heart,\r\nand in order to evacuate the fuliginous vapours which are found in it.”\r\n(Theor. iii.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXVI.—THE MARKS OF THE TEMPERAMENTS OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nThese are the marks of an unusually warm heart: largeness of respiration,\r\nquickness and density of pulse, boldness and maniacal ferocity, the\r\nchest is covered with hair, particularly the breast, and usually the\r\nparts of the hypochondriac regions adjoining to it; and the whole body\r\nis hot, unless the liver powerfully antagonise. And capacity of chest\r\nis also a mark of heat, unless the brain in that case antagonise. But\r\nan unusually cold heart has the pulse smaller than moderate, and such\r\npersons are timid and spiritless, more especially if there be no hairs\r\non the breast. Dryness of the heart renders the pulse hard, and the\r\npassions ungovernable, fierce, and difficult to quell; and, for the most\r\npart, the whole body is drier than usual, unless the parts about the\r\nliver antagonise. These are the marks of a more humid temperament: a soft\r\npulse, a disposition easily roused to anger, and easily pacified, and\r\nthe whole body more humid than common, unless antagonised by the parts\r\nabout the liver. When the temperament is both hotter and drier, the pulse\r\nis large, hard, and quick and dense; and the respirations large, quick,\r\nand dense. And of all others such persons have the most hair upon the\r\nbreast and præcordia; they are prone to action, given to anger, fierce\r\nand tyrannical in their dispositions; for they are both passionate and\r\nimplacable. But, if humidity prevails with heat, such persons are less\r\ncovered with hair than the afore-mentioned; they are prompt to action,\r\ntheir disposition is not fierce, but only prone to anger; their pulse is\r\nlarge, soft, quick, and dense. But when the temperament is more humid and\r\ncold than common, the pulse is soft, the disposition spiritless, timid\r\nand sluggish; they have no hair on the breast, and neither indulge in\r\nlasting resentment, nor are prone to anger. A cold and dry heart renders\r\nthe pulse harder and small. Of all others, such persons are least given\r\nto anger, but when provoked they retain their resentment. They are also\r\nparticularly distinguished by having no hair on the breast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. In the ancient system of physiology, the heart was considered\r\nas the seat of the Vital powers, its office being the preservation of\r\nthe innate heat of the body. The philosopher, Aristotle, had pointed\r\nout the connexion between heat and vitality, and had taught that the\r\nheart, as being the centre of heat, is the prime organ in the animal\r\nframe. Hence, as his commentator, Averrhoes, remarks, it is the _primum\r\nmovens et ultimum moriens_. Galen, however, maintained with Hippocrates,\r\nthat the animal frame is a circle, having neither beginning nor end,\r\nand that, consequently, it has no prime organ. He taught that the brain\r\ndoes not, properly speaking, derive its powers from the heart, nor the\r\nheart from the brain; but that these organs are mutually dependent\r\nupon one another, the heart being indebted to the brain for supplying\r\nthe parts concerned in respiration with muscular energy, and the brain\r\nbeing indebted to the heart for its vital heat, without which it could\r\nnot continue to be the vehicle of sensibility and motion. (De Placitis\r\nHippocrat. et Platon. pluries.) We have mentioned in the preceding\r\nSection, that the ancient physiologists looked upon respiration as being\r\na process similar to combustion. See Galen (de Usu Respirationis),\r\nAlexander Aphrodisiensis (Probl. i, 16.)\r\n\r\nThe heart, then, was supposed to convey heat to all parts of the body,\r\nby means of the animal spirits incorporated with the blood in the\r\narteries. Respecting the contents of the arteries, two hypotheses divided\r\nthe ancient schools of medicine. The first was that of the celebrated\r\nErasistratus, who maintained, that the arteries do not contain a fluid,\r\nbut merely certain airs or vapours. The other hypothesis was that\r\nof Galen, who keenly attacked this, as he did most of the tenets of\r\nErasistratus, and endeavoured to prove, by experiment, observation, and\r\nreasoning, that the contents of the arteries is blood, mixed, indeed,\r\nwith a certain proportion of heat and airs, but in every respect a fluid,\r\nlittle different from that contained in the veins. It was also part of\r\nhis system, that the right cavity of the heart attracts blood from the\r\nliver, and conveys it to the left, from which it is diffused all over the\r\nbody by the arteries. He taught that, at every systole of the arteries,\r\na certain portion of their contents is discharged at their extremities,\r\nnamely, by the exhalents and secretory vessels; and that at every\r\ndiastole a corresponding supply is attracted from the heart. He decidedly\r\ninculcates, in opposition to Asclepiades, that it is the expansion or\r\ndiastole of the artery which occasions the influx of the blood, and not\r\nthe influx of the blood which occasions the expansion of the artery; or,\r\nin other words, that the systole is the function of the heart, and the\r\ndiastole its return to its natural state. (De Diff. Puls. iv, 10.) Though\r\nhe demonstrated the anastomosis of arteries and veins, he nowhere hints\r\nhis belief, that the contents of the former pass into the latter, to be\r\nconveyed back to the heart, and from it to be again diffused over the\r\nbody. In a word, his system appears to have been nearly, or altogether,\r\nthe same as that which was afterwards taught by the unfortunate Servetus.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that Galen had made a very near approach to\r\nthe Harveian theory of the circulation; indeed, Harvey himself candidly\r\nadmits this. It will be perceived, from what we have stated, that the\r\ngrand point of difference between Galen and Harvey, and that upon which\r\nthe theory of the latter mainly rests, is the question whether or not\r\nat every systole of the left ventricle more blood be thrown out than is\r\nexpended on exhalation, secretion, and nutrition. Upon this point Galen\r\nheld the negative, Harvey, as we all know, the affirmative.\r\n\r\nIn proof of the opinions which we have attributed to Galen, we refer the\r\nreader to ‘An Natura Sanguinis sit in Arteriis;’ ‘Administ. Anatom.’\r\n(vii, 15); ‘de Usu Partium,’ (vi and vii, 7, 8, 9); ‘de Placitis Hippocr.\r\net Plat.’ (i, 5.)\r\n\r\nSee also Averrhoes (Colliget. ii, 8, ii, 9; Collect. i, 9; in Cant. Avic.\r\ni, 1); Avicenna (iii, xi, 1); Actuarius (de Spiritu Animali, i, 6; de\r\nCausis Urinarum, ii, 2); Nemesius (de Natura Hominis, 24.)\r\n\r\nWith regard to the passages collected by the ingenious M. Dutens\r\nand others, from the works of Hippocrates, Plato, Nemesius, Pollux,\r\nand Theodoret, to prove that the ancients were acquainted with the\r\ncirculation of the blood, as taught by Harvey, we shall only remark,\r\nthat, after having attentively considered them, we cannot but draw the\r\nconclusion, that some of these authors must have had, at least, an\r\nobscure idea of this doctrine, although, in general, these passages\r\nmay be understood to refer merely to the lesser circulation and the\r\nmovement of the blood from the centre to the extremities, as maintained\r\nby Galen. See Dutens (Origine des Découvertes attribuées aux Modernes,\r\np. 157); Drelincurtius (de Lienosis Epimetris); and Littré (Introduction\r\naux Œuvres d’Hippocrate.) The last of these writers, whose minute\r\nacquaintance with the earlier works on medicine entitles his opinion\r\nto every consideration, after a searching investigation into the state\r\nof anatomical knowledge in the days of Hippocrates and his immediate\r\nsuccessors, comes to the conclusion, that the germ of the theory of the\r\ncirculation is, beyond doubt, to be found in the Hippocratic treatises.\r\n(T. i, 223.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXVII.—DIAGNOSIS OF THE TEMPERAMENTS OF THE LIVER.\r\n\r\nThe marks of a hot liver are, largeness of the veins, redundance of\r\nyellow bile, and, in manhood, of black; the blood hotter than natural,\r\nand by means of it the whole body, unless the parts about the heart\r\nantagonise; and thick hairs upon the hypochondriac regions, and over\r\nthe stomach. Those of a cold are, smallness of the veins, much phlegm,\r\ncold blood; the whole habit of the body colder than common, unless\r\nwarmed by the heart; no hair on the hypochondriac regions, nor over\r\nthe stomach. Those of a dry are, thick and scanty blood, and the veins\r\nand the habit of the whole body drier. Those of a humid are, the blood\r\nabundant and liquid, the veins softer, as also the whole body, unless\r\nthe heart antagonise. The marks of a temperament at once hot and dry\r\nare, the hairs very thick on the hypochondrium, the blood at the same\r\ntime thicker and more scanty, a redundance of bitter bile, and in\r\nmanhood, of black, largeness and hardness of the veins, and the whole\r\nbody hot and dry. The heat proceeding from the heart may indeed overcome\r\nthe coldness proceeding from the liver, in like manner as the coldness\r\nmay the heat; but it is not possible for the dryness to be changed to\r\nthe contrary state by the humidity of the heart. It is obvious that,\r\nwhen the temperaments of those two prime organs combine together, the\r\nwhole body is affected accordingly. The humid and hot liver, less than\r\nthe hot and dry, renders the hypochondrium shaggy; but the blood is\r\nabundant, the veins large, and the whole habit humid and hot, unless\r\nthe heart antagonise. But, should it be preternaturally changed as to\r\nboth these qualities, persons so affected will be readily seized with\r\nputrid diseases and disorders from bad humours; and more particularly if\r\nthe humidity be much increased, and the heat but little, they will be\r\nliable to cacochymies. In the humid and cold, the hypochondrium is free\r\nfrom hairs, but the blood is pituitous, the veins contracted, and the\r\nwhole body in like manner, unless changed by the heart to the opposite\r\nstate. The cold and dry renders the blood scanty, the veins of the body\r\ncontracted, and the body colder; and the hypochondrium is without hair,\r\nunless the heart overcome this state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. According to the views of the ancient physiologists, the\r\nliver is the seat of the Natural powers, being the grand organ of\r\nsanguification, and the blood being the pabulum which nourishes the whole\r\nbody. That the liver performs an important part in the fabrication of the\r\nblood seems probable from all the veins of the stomach and upper portion\r\nof the intestines passing to the liver, whereby it is to be supposed,\r\nthat a considerable proportion of the nutritive juices will be conveyed\r\nto it; and from this viscus being proportionally large in the fœtus when\r\nit is much required to form blood, and cannot be supposed necessary for\r\nany other purpose. The ancients taught that the liver, by its attractive\r\npower, attracts the chyle from the stomach; that, by its retentive, it\r\nretains the same until the alterative convert it into blood; and that\r\nthen the expulsive separates the superfluities of the blood, namely, the\r\nbile, and conveys them to the gall-bladder. See Galen (T. ii, 285, ed.\r\nBasil), and Avicenna (iii, 4, 1.)\r\n\r\nAristotle held that the spleen is part of the hepatic system. (De\r\nPartibus Animal. iii, 7.) His commentator, Averrhoes, in like manner,\r\nconsiders the spleen as a second liver. (Collect. i, 9.) Their reasoning,\r\non this point, appears to me exceedingly acute and conclusive.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from Actuarius contains a clear exposition of\r\nancient opinions on the subject we are treating of: “When the food in the\r\nstomach is changed and digested, the meseraic veins, which derive their\r\norigin from the liver, by their vein called ramalis, suck the stomach\r\nand intestines; and having emulged, as it were, the purer part, (namely,\r\nthe food converted into chyle,) and having drawn it as if through a\r\nstrainer, they convey it to the concave part of the liver, and deliver\r\nit over to the sanguificatory power. Here, then, if nothing impede it,\r\nwhen it is changed into blood, whatever is subtile and acrid is received\r\nby the gall-bladder, which is placed at the convex part of the liver,\r\nand attracts the bile; but whatever the blood possesses of a terrene and\r\nmelancholic humour is attracted to the spleen, by some natural faculty,\r\nwhereby every part attracts whatever suits its nature. Thirdly, the\r\nserous humour remains. It is attracted by the kidneys.” (De Urinis, § 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXVIII.—DIAGNOSIS OF THE TEMPERAMENTS OF THE TESTICLES.\r\n\r\nOf the temperaments of the testicles, the hot is lustful, apt to\r\ngenerate, particularly males, and at an early age has the genital parts\r\ncovered with thick hairs, which extend to the surrounding part. The cold\r\nis the reverse. In the humid, the semen is copious and watery. In the\r\ndry, it is scanty and thick. A temperament which is moderately hot and\r\ndry has very thick semen, is most prolific, and rouses the person to\r\nearly indulgence. Such persons have, at a very early period, thick hairs\r\non their genital organs, and on the surrounding parts, as high up as the\r\nnavel, and as low down as the middle of the thighs. Such a temperament\r\nis prone to venery, but is soon satiated, and readily hurt if compelled.\r\nWhen humidity combines with heat, such persons have thick hair, and much\r\nsemen; yet they have not greater desires than others, but they can bear\r\nmuch venery without injury; and if both the moist and the hot combine\r\nproperly together, they cannot safely abstain from venery. Those whose\r\ntesticles are of the humid and cold temperament have no hair on the\r\nneighbouring parts; they are slow in beginning to copulate, and not much\r\nprone to the exertion. Their semen is watery, thin, without strength,\r\nand fit only for begetting females. The dry and the cold temperament\r\ntogether, resembles the former in every other respect, except that the\r\nsemen is thicker, and altogether scanty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The testicles were described by the ancient anatomists\r\nas being bodies composed of white glandular flesh, and surrounded by\r\ncoats which they knew to be processes of the peritoneum. The semen they\r\nconsidered as a white frothy fluid, elaborated from the blood, by passing\r\nthrough the convolutions of the spermatic vessels. Aristotle held it\r\nto be a superfluity collected from all parts of the system. His theory\r\nof generation is similar to that of Buffon. For the hypothesis of the\r\nEpicureans, see Lucretius (de R. N. iv.) They taught that the fœtus is\r\nthe joint production of the male semen, and something analogous secreted\r\nby the ovaria of the female.\r\n\r\nGalen has very ingenious ideas respecting the first organization of the\r\nfœtus, which he ascribes to a certain power in the semen, like that which\r\nBlumenbach calls a _nisus formativus_. (De Form. Fœtus.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXIX.—ON THE PARTS THAT ARE OMITTED.\r\n\r\nEach of our members has its own proper temperament and faculty; but it is\r\nnot necessary for us to describe the characters of all, since they are\r\nunlimited, and we propose to give only a brief system of instruction.\r\nHaving treated of those which principally affect the whole body, of the\r\nothers we shall merely direct them to be judged of in the same way,\r\nforming an opinion of the temperaments from their excretions, their\r\nother energies and symptoms. It is now time to treat of the cure of the\r\nintemperaments of the whole body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. On these consult Galen (de Temperamentis); Haly Abbas (Theor.\r\niii); Avicenna (i, 1, 3.) We may mention that, generally speaking,\r\nall those parts which possess much blood were supposed to be of a hot\r\ntemperament, and those which have little of a cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXX.—THE CORRECTION OF HOT INTEMPERAMENTS OF THE BODY.\r\n\r\nSince, in the hot intemperaments, the bile exceeds in quantity, if it\r\npass downward, little, it is obvious, need be done; but, if carried\r\nupwards to the stomach, it ought to be evacuated by vomiting, by taking\r\ntepid water after exercise, and before food. It will be better that\r\nthe exercise taken be not swift nor hard; but, on the contrary, rather\r\nslow and gentle. Some of those who are very hot do not at all require\r\ngymnastic exercises, but walking and the bath are sufficient for them.\r\nThese delight, also in baths after a meal. But those who have heat\r\ncombined with dryness, require a diluent regimen by means of succulent\r\nfood, baths, and abstinence from much and hard exercise; so that in the\r\nseason of summer they ought to bathe early, and after a meal a second\r\ntime. Cold drink is of service to them. Venery is most inimical to\r\ndry temperaments. Such ought also to abstain from exertions producing\r\nlassitude, exposure to the sun, and to avoid cares and watchfulness.\r\nThose who are naturally humid are apt in infancy to be seized with\r\nrheumatic and plethoric complaints, and also with putrid. They stand\r\nin need of more exercise, of a proper digestion in the stomach, and of\r\nsecretions by urine. Wherefore such persons are much benefited by taking\r\nbefore diet the bath two or three times, particularly the natural hot\r\nones. They ought also to promote the secretions by means of exercises,\r\nand the bath, and by procuring the alvine and urinary discharges\r\nbefore taking food. And nothing hinders them to use masticatories and\r\ncathartics, as also a wholesome diet, and wine of a diuretic quality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See, in like manner, Galen (de Sanitate tuenda, vi);\r\nOribasius (Synops. v, 51); Aëtius (iv, 9); Actuarius (de Diæta, c. 12.)\r\nOf the Arabians, Haly Abbas is the author who has delivered the treatment\r\nof the temperaments in the fullest manner. (Pract. i, 15.)\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that the condition of the body named the hot\r\nintemperament by the ancients is the same as that now generally called\r\na bilious habit. Accordingly, Galen directs the physician to attend\r\nwhether any pain or sense of weight be felt in the region of the liver,\r\nas, in that case, he judges it unsafe to take the bath after a meal,\r\nand recommends him rather to give deobstruents, and to proscribe food\r\nof a thick viscid nature. He particularly recommends an attenuant diet,\r\nand medicines of the same description, namely, wormwood, anise, bitter\r\nalmonds, &c. His views of practice, in short, appear to have been very\r\njudicious.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXI.—THE CORRECTION OF THE COLD INTEMPERAMENTS OF THE BODY.\r\n\r\nOf cold intemperaments there are three varieties, the worst of which\r\nis the dry; for such persons are from the first in that state which\r\ntime brings upon old men. They ought, therefore, to use whatever is\r\ndiluting and warming, such as moderate exercise, humid and warm food, the\r\nheating wines, and much sleep. Care should be taken by us, that all the\r\nexcrementitious matters collected in the body be evacuated every day.\r\nVenery hurts all those who are affected with dryness, and more especially\r\nif joined to coldness, and is innocuous to the hot and humid alone. The\r\ncold and humid temperaments are bad, and are very subject to rheumatic\r\naffections. They are relieved by abstinence from the bath, by frequent\r\nand light exercises, and the use of moderately heating unguents. Those\r\nthat are naturally colder, but are well regulated as to dryness and\r\nhumidity of temperament, ought to stimulate and increase their heat, but\r\nto choose the medium between a humid and dry diet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See the authorities referred to in the preceding Section.\r\nAll, in a word, copy from Galen. (l. c.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXII.—THE CURE OF THE DRY INTEMPERAMENTS, OF THE STOMACH FOR\r\nEXAMPLE; THEN OF THE OTHER INTEMPERAMENTS.\r\n\r\nA dry intemperament may either be occasioned by the parts of uniform\r\ntexture being drier than natural, in their solid parts, which is\r\nincurable; or by the natural moisture from which these parts derive their\r\nnourishment being lost. It is contained in all parts of an animal, being\r\ndiffused through them in the form of dew, and can only be supplied by\r\nmeans of the food. The former variety is utterly incurable; and even\r\nthe latter is of all states of the body the most intractable. But when\r\nthe dryness is seated in the small veins and arteries, the cure may be\r\nattempted by filling each of the parts of uniform texture with their\r\nproper juices by a humid diet. A tepid bath is therefore beneficial, and\r\nthe patient ought to remain long in the water. Immediately after the\r\nbath, let him take the milk of an ass newly drawn, to which a little\r\nwarm honey has been added. Afterwards he ought to rest until he take\r\na second bath. He ought then to be moderately rubbed with oil, if the\r\nmilk appears to be digested, which may be judged of from his eructations\r\nand the distension of his belly. The proper interval between the first\r\nand second bath may be four or five hours at the equinox, if he be to\r\nbathe a third time, but, if not, it may be greater. And he ought to be\r\nrubbed with oil before putting on his clothes after every bathing. If,\r\ntherefore, the milk agreed with him, we may give it to him after the\r\nsecond time, or, if not, we may give, instead, a ptisan properly boiled,\r\nor alica made into a ptisan; he is then to rest until the third bathing,\r\nor otherwise until supper. His bread ought to be carefully prepared,\r\nbaked in an oven, and of a fine quality; and as a seasoner, he may eat\r\nthose fishes which are caught among rocks, or the hake in a white soup.\r\nIn a word, his food ought to be of easy digestion and nutritious, not\r\noily and excrementitious. His drink should be wine that is weak, white,\r\nclear, bearing little water, and having some astringency. Such is the\r\nmode of cure for the greatest degree of dryness; but the moderate does\r\nnot require the same restriction as to diet, which may therefore be\r\nmore generous. Let us suppose a dryness like the former, but mixed\r\nwith a moderate coldness; and in this case, we must substitute certain\r\ncalefacient articles; and, with regard to those mentioned above, we must\r\nadd more honey to the milk, and give wine that is not so watery. We must\r\nalso not only use things which are naturally heating, but which are so\r\nfrom their acquired qualities. And the body is to be rubbed frequently\r\nwith the ointment of nard and mastich. When much coldness is joined to\r\nthe dryness, know in the first place, that the complaint is difficult\r\nand intractable, but use the same remedies, and also by itself honey\r\nthat has been boiled and scummed, along with very old wine. The best\r\npossible remedy in such cases is that which is much used by pitchers; and\r\nwe must likewise rub the belly with it, and tear it away while it is yet\r\nwarm. Such persons are also relieved by having a child of a full habit\r\nsleeping with them, so as to touch their belly. Let us next suppose that\r\na moderate heat is joined to dryness. In this case, our first care ought\r\nto be, not to taste honey, and to use wine which is not aged, food which\r\nis tepid and milky, and to rub the belly with the oil of unripe olives,\r\nor with that of apples. But to cool such persons much is not devoid of\r\ndanger, as their state is feverish when the heat prevails. Let us next\r\nsuppose that a hot intemperament prevails, and that humidity is joined\r\nto it. Such an intemperament is to be cured by drinking cold water.\r\nThe use of astringent food is also proper; namely, such things as are\r\naustere, without being heating. But when the humid intemperament alone\r\nprevails, such articles of food as are desiccant, without heating or\r\ncooling much are beneficial, and also abstinence from the common drinks.\r\nWhen the humid intemperament is joined with the cold, the best remedies\r\nare all acrid things, and they ought to be mixed with such things as are\r\nastringent, without being decidedly refrigerant. The drink should be\r\nin small quantity, and consist of some of the strongly heating wines.\r\nThese are the modes of curing intemperaments proceeding from qualities.\r\nBut since a humour contained within the cavity of the stomach, or being\r\nabsorbed within its coats, often occasions intemperaments, it will be\r\nproper to treat also of these affections. If the former state occur at\r\nonce, it may be easily removed by emetics; but if it be a defluxion, the\r\nparts it comes from will require very attentive consideration, and the\r\ncure will follow, of course; for it is to be applied entirely to the\r\naffected part; and of the other parts, we need only take care that they\r\nbe not thereby affected. The cure is to be performed by astringents, and\r\nsuch things as will bring the whole body to its proper habit. Depraved\r\nhumours in the coats of the stomach are to be evacuated by moderately\r\ncathartic medicines, such as aloes, and the powder prepared from it,\r\ncalled Picra. When a viscid phlegm is contained in the stomach, such\r\npersons ought first to take those things which will cut it, and then\r\nit may be purged off, or evacuated by vomiting with radishes. When the\r\nhumour is neither viscid nor thick, a vomit from ptisan, or that from\r\nhonied water, may be sufficient. The juice of wormwood with honied water\r\nmay also be drunk. In like manner, intemperaments in other parts may be\r\ncured, by finding out the evacuation suited to the humours; or, if the\r\npart has no sensible discharge, the prevailing matters and humours may be\r\nevacuated in the form of vapour; and in like manner, if it proceed from\r\nflatulence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen supplies all the matter of this Section. (l. c.)\r\n\r\nThe modern ideas respecting the temperaments, appear to be founded upon\r\nthe descriptions given by the Arabians of the symptoms which characterize\r\nthe prevalence of the four humours, as they were called, namely, blood,\r\nyellow bile, black bile, and phlegm, in the body. In proof of this, we\r\nsubjoin Rhases’ brief description of them: “De complexione autem infirmi\r\nscias, quod si fuerit albi coloris admixti rubedini, et si fuerit bonæ\r\ncarnis, subtilis cutis, et quando locum fricaveris, rubescit statim,\r\nsignificatur quod materia est sanguinea. Et si corpus fuerit pingue, et\r\nalbi coloris non mixti rubedini, et corpus nudum pilis, venis strictis,\r\ncarne molli, occultarum juncturarum, gracilium ossium, et generaliter\r\ntalis dispositio qualis est in corporibus mulierum, significatur quod\r\nmateria est phlegmatica. Et si fuerit macrum, citrini coloris, pilosum,\r\net cum crassis venis, et manifestis juncturis, ostendit quod materia\r\nest cholerica. Et si fuerit niger color, durities corporis, pilositas,\r\nasperitas cutis, significatur quod materia est melancholica.” (De Affect.\r\nJunct. 2.)\r\n\r\nIt is to be understood, however, that Galen’s system of the temperaments\r\nwas not based, as has been often erroneously represented, upon any\r\nhypothesis respecting the humours.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXIII.—ON THE POWERS OF THE ARTICLES OF FOOD.\r\n\r\nSince an account of the properties of food is a part of the doctrine of\r\nHygiene, we shall add that to the preceding, having premised only a few\r\nremarks before delivering the particular rules on this head; for nothing\r\nis more indispensably necessary than to be well acquainted with the\r\nproperties of food. Things of an attenuating power open the pores, and\r\nclear away the viscid humours which are impacted in them, and cut and\r\nattenuate the thick; but when persevered in as articles of food, they\r\nbeget serous and bilious superfluities, or, if still longer continued,\r\nthey render the blood melancholic. One ought therefore to abstain from\r\nthe continued use of them, and in particular those who are of a bilious\r\ntemperament; for they only suit with those who have collections of\r\nphlegm, and of crude, viscid, and thick humours. Those of incrassating\r\npowers are sufficiently nutritious, and, if properly digested in the\r\nstomach and liver, they form good blood, but occasion obstructions of\r\nthe spleen and liver. Of these some have only thick juices, as the dried\r\nlentil, but some viscid, as the mallows; and in some they are both thick\r\nand viscid, as the testaceous fishes. An attenuating diet is safer than\r\nan incrassating for the preservation of health, but yet, as it supplies\r\nlittle nourishment, it does not impart tone or strength to the body.\r\nOne ought, therefore, to take some moderately nutritious food, when\r\nexperiencing the effects of a deficient diet. They may do so with the\r\nleast danger who are given to exercises and can take as much rest as\r\nthey please. But all those who cannot take exercise before food ought to\r\navoid such things as are incrassating; and those who are of an indolent\r\nhabit ought by no means to take such food. For complete inactivity\r\nis one of the greatest evils for the preservation of health, whereas\r\nmoderate exercise is particularly good. Those articles of food which are\r\nintermediate between the incrassating and the attenuating are the best of\r\nall, producing blood of a proper consistency. Such a diet, then, agrees\r\nwith our bodies, but that which produces a bad chyme ought to be shunned.\r\nIt is better also to avoid variety of food, more particularly if it\r\nconsist of contrary qualities; for such things, when taken together, do\r\nnot digest properly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The ancient writers on Dietetics are, Hippocrates (de\r\nDiæta, de Affectionibus, et alibi); Celsus (ii); Dioscorides (Mat. Med.\r\nii); Galen (de Facult. Alim., et de Probis Pravisque Aliment. Suc.);\r\nXenocrates (de Aliment, ex aquat.); Oribasius (Med. Collect. i et seq.);\r\nAëtius (ii); Simeon Seth (de Alimentis); Actuarius (de Spiritu Animali,\r\np. ii); Anonymus (Tract, ap. Ermerins Anecdota Græca); Marcellus (Sideta\r\nde Piscibus); Psellus (Carmen de Re Medica); Rhases (ad Mansor. iii,\r\nCont. xxxiii); Avicenna (Cantic. p. ii); Averrhoes (Comment. de Cantic);\r\nHaly Abbas (Theor. v, 15); Athenæus (Deipnos. passim); Plutarch (de\r\nSanitate tuenda, Symposiacon); Macrobius (Saturnal. vii); Cælius Apicius\r\n(de Opsoniis); Geoponica (xii); Horace and Martial (pluries.)\r\n\r\nOf all the ancient writers on Dietetics, Galen is beyond dispute the\r\nbest. In the two treatises mentioned above, he has treated of everything\r\nconnected with this subject so fully and so correctly, as to leave little\r\nto be supplied even at the present day. All the subsequent authorities in\r\ngeneral are his servile copyists, with the exception of Averrhoes, who\r\ncommonly differs from him only by deviating into error.\r\n\r\nThe ancient philosophers were at great pains to explain why a regular\r\nsupply of food is necessary to the existence of animals. On this subject,\r\nTimæus Locrus, Plato, and Aristotle have philosophized with great\r\nacuteness and ingenuity. No one, however, has given a plainer account of\r\nthe matter than the poet Lucretius in the following verses:\r\n\r\n    “Illud item non est mirandum, corporis ipsa\r\n    Quod natura cibum quærit quoiusque animantis;\r\n    Quippe etenim fluere, atque recedere corpora rebus\r\n    Multa modis multis docui, sed plurima debent\r\n    Ex animalibus iis, quæ sunt exercita motu;\r\n    Multaque per sudorem ex alto pressa feruntur,\r\n    Multa per os exhalantur, quam languida anhelant:\r\n    His igitur rebus rarescit corpus; et omnis\r\n    Subruitur natura dolor quam consequitur rem.\r\n    Propterea capitur cibus, ut suffulceat artus,\r\n    Et recreat vires interdatus, atque patentem\r\n    Per membra ac venas ut amorem obturet edendi.”\r\n\r\n                          (De Rerum Nat. iv, 856.)\r\n\r\nThe explanation given by one of Rhases’ authorities is to the same\r\neffect. He says: “Since our bodies are in a continual state of waste\r\nfrom the surrounding atmosphere, and the innate heat which is within, it\r\nbehoved them to have nourishment to supply the part which is melted down;\r\nand, as all the food which is taken is not assimilated, it was necessary\r\nthat there should be passages for the discharge of the superfluities.”\r\n\r\nHippocrates, Aristotle, Galen, and Musonius (ap. Stobæi Sentent. 18)\r\nremark that the stomach is to animals what the earth is to vegetables.\r\n\r\nOur author’s general remarks on the properties of food are condensed from\r\nGalen’s work. (De Prob. p. Al. suc.) Horace agrees with Galen and our\r\nauthor in condemning the mixture of various articles of food. (Satir.\r\nii, 2.) The arguments for and against this practice are very ingeniously\r\nstated by Macrobius. (Saturn. vii, 5, 6.) It appears that Asclepiades\r\nmaintained the opinion that a multifarious diet is most easily digested.\r\n(Celsus, iii, 6.)\r\n\r\nThe ancients had the following meals during a day corresponding to those\r\nnow in use: breakfast, _jentaculum_, ἀκράτισμα; dinner, or rather lunch,\r\n_prandium_, ἄριστον; soirée, _merenda_, ἑσπέρισμα; supper, _cœna_,\r\nδεῖπνον. To these may be added the _commissatio_, κῶμος, which was a\r\nsort of jollification after the great meal or supper. See Athenæus (lib.\r\ni); Jo. Bruyer (de Re Cibar. iii, i); Lambinus (in Plut. Truculent,\r\nac. i, sc. 7, l. 16); Potter (Arch. Græc. iv, 16.) The common hour of\r\nbreakfast was about 7 o’clock a.m., of dinner about 3 p.m.; and of\r\nsupper about 8 p.m. The practice, however, of taking so many meals\r\nappears to have been disapproved of by the physicians and _savans_: for\r\nwe find Actuarius discussing the question whether it be proper to eat\r\ntwice or only once in the day; and Galen decidedly recommends people\r\nnot to take food in general oftener than twice. Cicero even forbids to\r\ntake two full meals in a day. (Tuscul. Quæst. v.) Hippocrates speaks\r\nwith disapprobation of the practice of eating a full dinner. (De Vet.\r\nMed.) Suetonius makes it a reproach to Domitian that he dined fully.\r\n(In Domit.) Haly Abbas enters into a full examination of the question\r\nwith regard to the number of meals. Some, he says, eat only once in the\r\nday, some twice, and others three times. He advises those persons who\r\nare actively employed not to dine, because, if obliged to take exercise\r\nimmediately afterwards, the body will be loaded with half concocted\r\nchyle. Upon the whole he prefers supper to dinner. (Pract. i, 13.)\r\nAlsaharavius considers one meal in the day not sufficient for persons\r\nof a gross habit of body. He advises persons not to change even a bad\r\nregimen too suddenly. Rhases remarks, that to take another supply of food\r\nbefore a preceding meal is digested, will prove highly prejudicial to the\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nFrom the views of domestic life given in the Greek novels we are inclined\r\nto think that the supper was the only meal which all the members of\r\na family of the better class partook of together. See in particular\r\nAchilles Tatius (pluries.) The breakfast and dinner were light meals,\r\nconsisting of bread or cheese dipped in wine. (Apul. Metam. and Martial\r\nEpigr.)\r\n\r\nThe ancient physicians attached great importance to the proper regulation\r\nof the diet. Galen seriously admonishes his readers not to eat\r\nthoughtlessly, like brute beasts, but to consider attentively what kinds\r\nof food and drink they find from experience to be prejudicial to them.\r\n(De Sanit. tuenda, vi, 13.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Athenæus, a good physician ought to be a good cook.\r\n(Deipnos. vii.) Upon the authority of Daphnus, the Ephesian physician,\r\nhe decides that night is the most proper time for taking the supper or\r\nprincipal meal, because, says he, the moon promotes putrescency, and\r\ndigestion is a species of putrefaction. (vii, 2.)\r\n\r\nThe processes which food undergoes in the body from its first\r\nintroduction to its complete assimilation are stated in a very scientific\r\nmanner by Macrobius. In the first place, he says, it is dissolved in the\r\nstomach, as much of it at least as is digestible, and that which is not\r\nsoluble passes down to the intestine, while the chyme, or portion which\r\nhas been dissolved, passes to the liver, there to undergo the second\r\nprocess of digestion, namely, sanguification, or conversion into blood.\r\nIt then passes into the arteries or veins, where it undergoes its third\r\nspecies of digestion, namely, purification, by having its recrementitious\r\nparticles sent off in the form of bile and urine. It is then conveyed to\r\nthe different parts of the body where the fourth process of digestion is\r\naccomplished, namely, assimilation, by which it is converted into the\r\ndifferent substances of which the body is composed. (Saturnal. vii, 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXIV.—ON POT-HERBS.\r\n\r\nThe lettuce is manifestly refrigerant and moistening; it is therefore\r\nsoporific, and, compared with other pot-herbs, nutritious, forming blood\r\nof a very good quality. The endive is refrigerant and moistening, but\r\nless so than the lettuce. The mallows cool but not obviously: they rather\r\nmoisten and thereby loosen the belly; and this they do by means of the\r\nviscid juice which they contain. The beet is detergent, and thereby\r\nsoftens the belly; but when eaten in great quantity it occasions pain\r\nof the stomach: it removes obstructions of the liver and spleen. The\r\ncabbage, when twice boiled before it is eaten, binds the belly, but when\r\nonly once boiled for a short time, it rather loosens, if eaten with oil,\r\nsauce, or salts; as its juice, still more than the dried lentil, is\r\nof a purgative quality; and in particular the sea-cabbage is laxative\r\nof the belly, being manifestly saltish and bitter. The sea-purslane\r\ntree, possessing stronger saline qualities, loosens the belly, and\r\nagrees better with the stomach than the cabbage, from having a moderate\r\nastringency; it is also fitted for forming milk and semen. The blite and\r\norache (_atriplex hortensis_) and such like are succulent and laxative,\r\nbut not nutritious. All the thorny tribe, such as the cardoons, the\r\natractylis, and such like are stomachic, except the _cinara_, for, being\r\nhard, it forms bad chyme; and, therefore, it is best to take it boiled\r\nwith oil, fish-sauce, and coriander. The parsley, the horse-parsley\r\n(_smyrnium olusatrum_), the water parsnip, and the allsander, are\r\ndiuretic; but the allsander is aromatic, and more acrid, diuretic, and\r\nemmenagogue, whereas the parsley and horse-parsley are sweeter, and,\r\ntherefore, agree better with the stomach. The rocket (_brassica eruca_)\r\nis hot, and forms semen; and, therefore, rouses to venery and occasions\r\nheadachs. The cress, basil (_ocimum_), and mustard are hot and acrid,\r\nparticularly the cress; but all are of difficult digestion, injure the\r\nstomach, and supply unwholesome juices. But the nettle is attenuant,\r\nlaxative, and of little nourishment. The toothpick-fennel is like the\r\nshepherd’s needle, possessing astringent and bitter qualities in no small\r\ndegree; it is beneficial to the stomach, so that those who have lost\r\ntheir appetite may eat it with advantage in vinegar; but it supplies\r\nlittle nourishment to the body. All the wild pot-herbs, as they are\r\ncalled, contain very bad juices. Capers, however, whet the appetite,\r\nremove obstructions of the liver and spleen, and evacuate phlegm. They\r\nare to be used with vinegar and honey, or with vinegar and oil, before\r\ntaking any other food.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Athenæus remarks that the use of pot-herbs, as articles\r\nof food, appears to have been very ancient, since several of them are\r\nmentioned by Homer. (Deipnos, i, 29.) Diphilus says, “all pot-herbs in\r\ngeneral contain little nutriment, are attenuant, engender bad juices,\r\nswim in the stomach, and are of difficult digestion.” (Deipnos, ii, 28.)\r\nActuarius states, that pot-herbs in general form a thin and watery blood,\r\ncompared with that from thicker articles of food.\r\n\r\nThe ancients ate their pot-herbs with much oil, and generally a liberal\r\nallowance of hot spices. See Apicius (iii.) A sauce from pickled fish,\r\nvinegar, or old wine, was often added to the preparation. The poet\r\nJuvenal makes mention of a miser who ate his cabbage with the oil from\r\nlamps. (Sat. v, 87.) Celsus remarks of such things, “Quodcunque ex olio\r\ngarove estur olus alienum stomacho est.”\r\n\r\nWe now select from the dietetical writers a few remarks on the most\r\nimportant articles of this class.\r\n\r\nGalen strongly recommends the lettuce as a cooling, moistening, and\r\nsoporific herb. He relates that he cured himself of morbid insomnolency\r\nby eating liberally of lettuces. The soporific property of lettuces is\r\nmentioned by Dioscorides, Pliny, Athenæus, Rhases, Haly Abbas, Simeon\r\nSeth, and most of the other authorities. It is even said by Simeon Seth\r\nand Florentinus (Geopon. xvii, 13), that the juice of it when rubbed upon\r\nthe forehead induces sleep. We need scarcely remark, that the lettuce\r\nwas lately restored to its place in the Materia Medica as a soporific.\r\nMartial directs the lettuce to be eaten at the beginning of a feast (xi,\r\nep. 53); Athenæus at the end.\r\n\r\nAthenæus mentions that mallows are praised by the poet Hesiod. (Op. et\r\nDies. i.) He adds, “Diphilus relates that mallows have good juices,\r\nsmooth the trachea, are easily evacuated, and prove moderately\r\nnutritious.” Damogeron says that when eaten with fish sauce and oil,\r\nthey loosen the belly. (Geopon. l. c.) Galen and Aëtius state that they\r\nlubricate the intestines more than lettuce, but are not so refrigerant.\r\nIn a word, mallows were in great repute with the ancients, as being\r\ninferior to none of the oleracea. Horace calls them “gravi malvæ salubres\r\ncorpori.” (Epod. ii.) The poet Martial mentions them as being laxative.\r\n(x.) Different species of mallows were probably used by the ancients for\r\nfood, but more especially the _Malva rotundifolia_ L.\r\n\r\nGalen states that the juice of the beet is thinner and more detergent\r\nthan those of the lettuce and mallows. He says that, when twice boiled\r\nit becomes astringent. Apicius recommends boiled beet to be eaten with\r\nmustard, a moderate proportion of oil, and vinegar. Beet-root, according\r\nto Actuarius and Simeon Seth, is difficult to digest, flatulent, and\r\nlaxative. Dioscorides and Diphilus, however, state that beet contains\r\nbetter juices, and is more nutritious than cabbage. Athen. (Deipn. ix.)\r\nGalen recommends its pickled roots as deobstruent in infarction of the\r\nliver and spleen. (De Alim. Facult. ii.)\r\n\r\nThe wild succory and the endive or garden succory were much used by the\r\nancients as pot-herbs. Galen briefly states, that in properties they\r\nresemble lettuces, but are less delicious. According to Simeon Seth,\r\nthey are slightly cooling and moistening. The endive, he says, when\r\nboiled with vinegar is astringent. Rhases praises it as a deobstruent in\r\naffections of the liver. Apicius directs it to be dressed with fish-sauce\r\nand oil. Its boiled roots were also prepared as a pickle.\r\n\r\nThe brassicæ, or cabbages, were great favorites of the elder Cato. (De\r\nRe Rust.) Horace states correctly, that such as grow in the country\r\nare better than those which are raised about towns. (Sat. ii, 4.)\r\nAccording to Galen, their juices are laxative, but their solid parts\r\nastringent. Brocoli, says Rhases, when not pickled are not heating, and\r\nbeing flatulent they engender semen: those that are pickled are more\r\nheating, occasion thirst, supply bad nutriment, and inflame the blood.\r\nIs _brocoli_ an Italian word, or an Arabian, formed from _caulis_ with a\r\nprefix?\r\n\r\nThe halimus, according to Sprengel, is the _atriplex halimus_ L.,\r\ncalled by Miller the sea purslane; but by others it is referred to the\r\n_salicornia fruticosa_ L. Dioscorides says that its leaves when boiled\r\nare used for food. (i, 120.)\r\n\r\nRhases and Haly Abbas state that spinach is laxative and wholesome. The\r\nGreeks and Romans appear to have been unacquainted with it.\r\n\r\nThe atractylis is supposed by Sprengel to be the _carlina lanata_ L. a\r\nwoolly carline thistle. Dioscorides and Pliny recommend it as an antidote\r\nagainst poisons; but it seems to have been little used as a pot-herb.\r\n\r\nThe nettle (either the _urtica dioica_ or _pillulifera_) is mentioned\r\nas a pot-herb by Theophrastus (H. P. vii, 7), and most of the medical\r\nauthorities. Psellus calls it laxative.\r\n\r\nThe scandix, or shepherd’s needle, was in little repute as an article of\r\nfood; and hence Aristophanes makes it a subject of reproach to Euripides,\r\nthat his mother sold not good pot-herbs, but scandix. (Achar. act. ii,\r\nsc. 4; Pliny, H. N. xxii, 38.)\r\n\r\nGalen says that the gingidium is eaten in Syria, like the scandix in\r\nhis country. It has been supposed, by Bruyer and others, to be the\r\nchærophyllum or chervil; but, according to Ludovicus Nonnius, this is a\r\nmistake. We are inclined to refer it to the _daucus gingidium_ L., or\r\npick tooth.\r\n\r\nGalen, Aëtius, and Simeon Seth speak of the cinara as an unwholesome\r\npot-herb. It may be eaten, however, Galen says, with oil, fish-sauce,\r\nand wine and coriander. Many of the authorities have referred it to the\r\nartichoke, but it seems to be now settled that no ancient writer has\r\nnoticed _it_, with the exception of Columella, who has given a very\r\nstriking description of it. (x, 237.) We cannot decide positively what\r\nthe _cinara_ was.\r\n\r\nDioscorides says, that the scolymus is eaten like asparagus. (iii, 16.)\r\nIt is the _scolymus Hispanicus_, or Spanish cordoons.\r\n\r\nThe hipposelinum appears to have been the _smyrnium olusatrum_. See\r\nHarduin’s note on Pliny (H. N. xix, 48), and Sprengel (ad Dioscor. iii,\r\n71.) Dioscorides says it is used as a pot-herb, like parsley, its root\r\nbeing eaten boiled or raw, and its stalk and leaves boiled, either\r\nalone or with fish. It is not to be confounded with the smyrnium of the\r\nancients, which is the _smyrnium perfoliatum_. Dioscorides says that the\r\nlatter, when pickled, is used as a pot-herb, and is astringent.\r\n\r\nGalen says that the blite and orache are watery pot-herbs, and almost\r\ninsipid. Seth, and the other authorities who notice it, agree that\r\nthe latter is cooling and laxative. The blite is still much used as a\r\npot-herb in Spain and Italy. It is the _blitum capitatum_.\r\n\r\nXenophon mentions that the ancient Persians lived very much upon cresses,\r\nusing them as a seasoner to their food. (Cyroped. i, 2.) According to\r\nAëtius and Simeon Seth, they are calefacient and desiccative. Seth calls\r\nthem aphrodisiacal. On the aphrodisiacal powers of the cresses and\r\nrocket, see Section xxxvi.\r\n\r\nThe sion was probably the _sium nodiflorum_, procumbent water-parsnip. It\r\nwas used as a substitute for the cress.\r\n\r\nDioscorides says that the root of the dracunculus, or dragon-herb, is\r\nsometimes eaten as a pot-herb, both when boiled and raw. He mentions that\r\nthe inhabitants of the Balearian Isles mix its root with honey, and use\r\nit at their banquets in place of cakes. (ii, 16.) Simeon Seth notices it\r\nby the name of tarchon, being a corruption from Tarragona. He calls it\r\nflatulent and unwholesome, and says that its leaves only are to be used\r\nalong with mint and parsley. Galen and Rhases likewise mention it as an\r\narticle of food. The aron was a plant nearly allied to it, but one which\r\nit is difficult to determine accurately.\r\n\r\nMustard, as Hippocrates remarks, is of a hot and purgative nature. Seth\r\nsays that it promotes the digestion and distribution of the food. Rhases\r\nforbids it to be eaten, except along with thick articles of food.\r\n\r\nPliny mentions the ocymum or basil in very unfavorable terms.\r\n\r\nThe dock, _rumex_ L., is sometimes mentioned as a pot-herb, but does\r\nnot appear to have been much in use. Horace alludes to its laxative\r\nproperties. Galen says some women affected with _pica_ and _bizarre_\r\nchildren eat the oxylapathum (_rumex acutus_ L.) raw, but that it is\r\nstill less nutritious than the lapathum.\r\n\r\nCapers, says Aëtius and Seth, consist of different qualities, as\r\nbitterness, which renders them detergent, purgative, and penetrative;\r\nacrimony, which makes them calefacient, discutient, and attenuant;\r\nand sourness, which renders them astringent. Serapion says that, when\r\npickled with vinegar, they strengthen the stomach and whet the appetite.\r\nWhen pickled with salt, he says, they are bad for the stomach. Galen\r\nrecommends pickled capers in obstruction of the liver and spleen.\r\n\r\nThe buglossum, or borage, is frequently mentioned as a herb which, when\r\neaten, imparts gladness to the soul. Ludovicus Nonnius informs us that\r\nthe Belgians still fancy that it possesses this property, and look upon\r\nit as the Homeric nepenthes.\r\n\r\nWe have had occasion to mention in another place that the ancients were\r\nfully persuaded of the aphrodisiacal properties of the eruca, or rocket.\r\n\r\nThe strychnos has been generally supposed to be some species of\r\n_solanum_. It is mentioned as a pot-herb by Theophrastus, Dioscorides,\r\nand Galen, but was in little repute. Several other plants are mentioned\r\nas pot-herbs by the dietetical writers, such as fennel, anise, dill,\r\nhyssop, and wild thyme, but they are of little importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXV.—ON ASPARAGI OR YOUNG SHOOTS.\r\n\r\nBlites, lettuces, orachs, mallows, and beets have the plant juicy, but\r\nthe shoot dry. The turnip, mustard, radish, cress, pellitory, cabbage,\r\nand other hot things, have the plant of a dry, but the shoot of a juicy\r\nnature. The shoots of the bushy shrubs, both the marsh and garden,\r\nand that of the bryony, are stomachic and diuretic, but of little\r\nnourishment, yet when digested they are more nutritious than those of\r\npot-herbs. Such also are the shoots of the ground-bay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Suidas (in Voce); Galen (de Alim. Facult.); Humelbergius\r\nad Apul. (de Med. Hist. 84.) Our author’s account of the Asparagi is\r\nabridged from Galen. He remarks that the young shoots of the cabbage,\r\ncalled cymæ, are particularly tender. Apicius directs them to be prepared\r\nwith cumin, salt, old wine, and oil; to which pepper, borage, and the\r\nlike may be added.\r\n\r\nOn the Asparagi, see Athenæus. (Deipnos. ii.)\r\n\r\nThe plant now commonly known by the name of asparagus is said by Simeon\r\nSeth to be so nutritious that it deserves to hold an intermediate place\r\nbetween pot-herbs and flesh. He remarks, that it is diuretic, and imparts\r\nits smell to the urine. The wild asparagus is called corruda by Cato,\r\nColumella, and Pliny.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXVI.—ON HERBS HAVING ESCULENT ROOTS.\r\n\r\nThe bunias or turnip, when eaten after being twice boiled, is nutritious,\r\nno less so than other herbs, but when frequently taken it engenders\r\nthick juices. The bulbi are astringent and detergent, whet the appetite,\r\nstrengthen the stomach, and evacuate the viscid humours contained in the\r\nchest. When twice boiled, they are more nourishing, but less expectorant,\r\nhaving lost their bitter principle. They are productive of semen, and\r\naphrodisiacal when liberally used, and occasion flatulence and griping.\r\nWhen eaten with fish-sauce and oil, they are very sweet, do not create\r\nflatulence, are nutritious and digestible. The garden and wild carrot\r\nand the caraway have roots which are less nutritious than turnip, but\r\nhot, decidedly aromatic, and diuretic. But when used too freely, they\r\nsupply bad juices, and become of difficult digestion, like other roots.\r\nSome call the wild carrot daucus; it is evidently more diuretic than\r\nthe other. The radish is of an attenuant and heating nature; but may be\r\neaten before other food along with vinegar and fish-sauce, to loosen\r\nthe bowels, but by no means after a meal. The onion, garlic, leek, and\r\ndog-leek (_ampeloprason_), being of an acrid nature, warm the body,\r\nattenuate and cut the thick humours contained in it; when twice boiled,\r\nthey give little nourishment, but when unboiled they do not nourish at\r\nall. The garlic is more deobstruent and diaphoretic than the others;\r\nand the dog-leek, being wild, is drier than the common leek. Regarding\r\npot-herbs in general, the raw, when eaten, furnish worse juices than\r\nthe boiled, as they have more excrementitious juice. But those which\r\nare prepared for pickles with brine or vinegar and salt are stomachic,\r\nand whet the appetite, and discuss crude humours; but are of difficult\r\ndigestion, and supply bad juices when too freely taken.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen thus delivers the general character of these\r\nsubstances: The roots of pot-herbs which are acrid, such as those of\r\nonions, leeks, garlic, radish, and carrot, contain bad juices; but those\r\nof turnips, rapes, and caraways hold an intermediate place between things\r\nof good and of bad juices.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the Romans had two kinds of herbs with esculent\r\nroots, called the napus and rapum, and that they are generally admitted\r\nto have been two species of the turnip. See Columella (de R. Rust. ii,\r\n10); Pliny (H. N. xviii, 13) and the note of Harduin; Sprengel (R. H.\r\nH. t. i.) The term bunias occurs first in Nicander; and that it was\r\nsynonymous with the gongylis is declared by Galen and our author; and,\r\nfurther, that it was the _brassica napobrassica_ L., or wild navew,\r\nis admitted by all the late authorities on classical botany, with the\r\nexception of Dierbach, who most unaccountably contends that it is the\r\n_B. oleracea_. Galen says that unless well boiled it is indigestible,\r\nflatulent, and bad for the stomach. Seth assigns it the same qualities as\r\nour author. All account it diuretic and aphrodisiacal. Apicius directs\r\nthe rapa and napi to be eaten with cumin, rue, vinegar, oil, &c. (iii,\r\n13.) Cato the Censor was very fond of turnips, and used to prepare them\r\nwith his own hands. It appears from Athenæus that the ancients frequently\r\nate their turnips roasted. They also ate turnips prepared as a pickle\r\nwith vinegar and mustard at the commencement of a feast, as whetters.\r\n(Deipnos. iv, 11.) According to Diphilus, in this state they are more\r\nattenuant than in their natural state. (Deipnos. ix, 8.)\r\n\r\nIt is not well ascertained what the esculent bulbi of the ancients were.\r\nHarduin conjectures that they were a delicious kind of onions. Matthiolus\r\nand Nonnius are wholly undecided. Sprengel inclines, with Dalecampius\r\nand Sibthorp, to think that they were a species of muscari, or musk\r\nhyacinth. The account given of them by Serapion, who calls them _capæ\r\nsine tunicis_, agrees better with the conjecture of Harduin. Eustathius\r\nlikewise says that the bulbus was a wild onion. (Ad Iliad. xiii, 589.)\r\nColumella, Varro, Apicius, and Martial call them aphrodisiacal.\r\n\r\nThe staphylinus was probably the carrot, or _daucus carota_, but we are\r\ninclined to think that it also comprehended the parsnip. See Athen.\r\n(Deip. ix, 2.) Apicius, among other methods of dressing it, directs it to\r\nbe done with salt, pure oil, and vinegar.\r\n\r\nThe sisarum was probably the garden parsnip, _pastinaca sativa_ L.\r\n\r\nThe carus seems indisputably to have been the _carum carui_ L.\r\nDioscorides says that its boiled root may be eaten like the carrot.\r\nSeth praises it as being carminative, diuretic, and astringent. Apicius\r\nmentions it frequently along with spices and other aromatics.\r\n\r\nThe characters of the onion, garlic, and leek are taken from Galen.\r\nCelsus calls them calefacient, and ranks them with things having\r\nunwholesome juices. Actuarius prefers the leek to the onion and garlic.\r\nThe latter is warmly eulogised by Galen, as being the rustic’s theriac.\r\nHorace had not so much favour for it. (Epod. iii.) Galen calls the\r\nampeloprason the same as the wild leek. (De Fac. Simp. vi.) Dioscorides\r\ndescribes two species of the porrum, namely, the capitatum and sectivum.\r\n\r\nThe asphodel (_asphodelus ramosus_) is mentioned as an article of food by\r\nthe poet Hesiod. Galen, however, speaks of its being eaten only in times\r\nof scarcity.\r\n\r\nGalen directs radishes to be eaten before dinner, as a laxative. He\r\njustly expresses his surprise at the practice of certain physicians,\r\nand other persons of his time, who ate radish after dinner to promote\r\ndigestion. The wild radish was called armoracia by the Romans, as we are\r\ninformed by Dioscorides.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXVII.—ON TRUFFLES AND MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\nThe truffle (_tuber_) forms chyme devoid of qualities, but cold and\r\nthick. The mushrooms called _mycetæ_, being of a cold nature, form phlegm\r\nand bad chyme. Of these, the _boleti_ are devoid of qualities, and are\r\nsafer than the others when boiled properly. The _amanitæ_ are of the\r\nsecond order. The other mushrooms ought not to be tasted, for many of\r\nthem are mortal poisons; and even the _boleti_, when eaten without being\r\nproperly boiled, have often proved dangerous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Diphilus says “Fungi are grateful to the stomach, laxative,\r\nand nutritious, but of difficult digestion, and flatulent.” (Athen.\r\nDeipnos. ii, 19.) He adds, “the nature of truffles is, that they are\r\ndifficult to digest, supply good juices, and are laxative; but some of\r\nthem, like the fungi, occasion suffocation.” (Ibid. 51.) Galen says\r\nthat they contain cold, viscid, and thick juices. Serapion says that\r\nthey engender gross humours. According to Avicenna they are apt to\r\nsuper-induce apoplexy and paralysis. Simeon Seth says that truffles\r\noccasion crude and depraved humours. He directs them to be steeped in\r\nwater for some hours before boiling them; and prepared with pepper,\r\nmarjoram, salt, and rue, to correct their bad properties. Rhases, in\r\nlike manner, recommends us to eat truffle boiled in water, with salt,\r\nmarjoram, oil, and assafœtida. He also recommends wine, honied water,\r\nor the theriac after mushrooms. Apicius directs fungi to be eaten with\r\npepper, oil, salt, &c. Horace points out the best kind of fungi.\r\n\r\n            “Pratensibus optima fungis\r\n    Natura est: aliis male creditur.”\r\n\r\n                           (Sat. ii, 4.)\r\n\r\nThe poets make frequent mention of mushrooms as a delicacy at the tables\r\nof gourmands. See in particular Juvenal (Sat. v, 145.)\r\n\r\nApicius directs us to preserve truffles, by laying them in a vessel along\r\nwith alternate layers of sawdust, and then covering up the mouth of the\r\nvessel with parget. On the mode of raising them, see ‘Geopon.’ (xii, 41.)\r\nIn the days of Juvenal, the Roman gourmands appear to have attached more\r\nimportance to the truffles than the corn which they were supplied with\r\nfrom Africa:\r\n\r\n          “Tibi habe frumentum, Alledius inquit,\r\n    O Lybie; disjunge boves dum tubera mittas.”\r\n\r\n                                   (Sat. v, 116.)\r\n\r\nLudovicus Nonnius confesses himself unable to determine what species\r\nof mushroom the amanitæ of our author were. Seth makes no distinction\r\nbetween them and the mycetæ. See further Athen. (Deip. ii, 7, ed.\r\nSchweig.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXVIII.—ON THE FRUMENTACEOUS ARTICLES OF FOOD.\r\n\r\nOf the frumentacea, the chondrus is nutritious, and forms viscid chyme;\r\nbut a watery preparation is unwholesome, because, as it thickens\r\nquickly, it remains raw and unconcocted; but the juice of it is better\r\nwhen it is properly boiled whole, like a ptisan. The alica, in other\r\nrespects, resembles the chondrus, only that it binds the bowels more.\r\nWheat, when boiled and eaten, is of difficult digestion and flatulent;\r\nbut if digested it proves a very strong food. When made into bread, its\r\nindigestible and flatulent properties are removed by the leaven and salt\r\nwhich are added. The most nutritious of all the kinds of bread is that\r\nmade from siligo; next, that from the similago; and, third, that which\r\nis composed of the entire grain. Coarse bread is less nutritious, but\r\nmore laxative than the other kinds. Starch gives little nourishment,\r\nlike washed bread. Barley is of a cold nature and detergent: when boiled\r\nlike a ptisan it humectates; but when toasted, as in polenta, it dries.\r\nPolenta in summer, drunk with water before the bath, quenches thirst.\r\nBarley-bread is dry and of little nourishment. The pudding (maza) is\r\nof more difficult digestion, and more flatulent than barley-bread, and\r\nwhen it receives a little honey is laxative. Oats are heating and of\r\nlittle nourishment. Millet and panic are cold and dry, contain little\r\nnourishment, and bind the bowels. But the millet is in every respect\r\nsuperior to the panic. Rice is of difficult digestion, contains little\r\nnourishment, and binds the bowels. A ptisan is prepared, by adding one\r\npart of it to fifteen parts of water, then mixing a moderate quantity of\r\noil, and after it swells up, some vinegar. When properly boiled, a small\r\nquantity of salt is to be thrown in, and sometimes leeks or dill may be\r\nadded. Oats and chondrus may be prepared in like manner as a ptisan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. On the cerealia consult in particular Theophrastus (H. P.\r\niii); Dioscorides (ii); Galen (de Aliment. i); Pliny (H. N. xviii);\r\nSerapion (de Simpl.); and of the modern authorities see, in particular,\r\nHarduin (Notæ in Plin. l. c.); Paucton (Metrologie); Dickson (Husbandry\r\nof the Ancients); Sprengel (R. H. H. and Notæ in Diascor. l. c.);\r\nLudovicus Nonnius (de Re Cibaria, i); and J. Bruyerinus Campegius (de Re\r\nCibaria.)\r\n\r\nAmong the cerealia, wheat, as Galen states, deservedly holds the first\r\nplace, being in most general use and containing the most nutriment within\r\na small bulk. He remarks, that it is the most glutinous of all the\r\narticles of this class.\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas likewise states that wheat is the most nutritious of all\r\narticles of food. Pliny asserts the same thing of it. He calls the siligo\r\nthe _deliciæ tritici_. Galen explains the siligo and similago in much the\r\nsame terms as our author. The third species, or the autopyrus, he says,\r\nconsists of all the parts of the grain, the bran not being excluded.\r\nActuarius, on the other hand, says that the bran only is rejected. Is\r\nnot the text of the latter corrupt? Bran, Galen adds, is detergent,\r\nand contains little nourishment. Modern commentators have been greatly\r\npuzzled to determine what the _siligo_, _similago_, and _autopyrus_ of\r\nthe ancients were. It appears impossible to reconcile all the different\r\ndescriptions of them given by ancient writers, and therefore we cannot\r\nbut suspect that some of them must have written from an imperfect\r\nacquaintance with the subject. Upon the whole, we are inclined to think\r\nthat we shall not be far from the truth if we set them down as varieties\r\nof flour or bread, as regards quality, corresponding in a great measure,\r\nto the kinds of bread now distinguished by the names of the white, the\r\nwheaten, and the household. At all events the _autopyrus_ is certainly\r\nanalogous to the last. The furfuraceus, or panis cibarius of Celsus, was\r\nmade solely from bran.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus mentions that the lightest wheat imported to Greece in his\r\ntime was the Pontic. It is curious to remark that Odessa wheat still\r\nretains its ancient character. The heaviest, he says, was the Sicilian,\r\nwhich, however, was lighter than the Bœotian. Pliny says that the\r\nlightest wheat brought to the Roman market was the Gallic, and then that\r\nimported from the Chersonese. The first in excellence, he adds, are the\r\nBœotian, the Sicilian, and next to these the African.\r\n\r\nGalen gives an interesting account of bread. The best kinds, he says, are\r\nsuch as contain plenty of leaven, have been properly pounded, and exposed\r\nto a moderate heat in the oven. When exposed to too strong a heat, he\r\nproperly remarks that a crust is burned on the outside, while the inside\r\nis left raw or improperly concocted. Unleavened bread he wholly condemns.\r\nCelsus appears to have had a better opinion of it, for he ranks it first\r\namong those substances which do not spoil on the stomach. Of bread, in\r\ngeneral, he correctly remarks, “Siquidem plus alimenti est in pane quam\r\nin ullo alio.” Pliny and Galen describe a soft spongy kind of bread,\r\nwhich would seem to have resembled that which we call buns. Pliny adds,\r\nthat some nations prepare their bread with butter. He mentions a kind of\r\nbread called _artolagani_, which, according to Dr. Arbuthnot, answered\r\nto our cakes. Seth gives an interesting account of bread, but it is\r\nmostly extracted from Galen. Haly Abbas says, that the best kind of bread\r\nis that which is made from wheaten flour and salt, and is fermented,\r\nand heated in an oven to such a degree as not to burn the outer crust.\r\nRhases disapproves entirely of unleavened bread. Serapion states that\r\nold bread is astringent. Avenzoar prefers newly-made bread, provided it\r\nhas been cooled. Hippocrates condemns the eating of bread before it has\r\nbeen properly cooled. (De Diæt. i.) He mentions only two kinds of bread,\r\nthe fine and the coarse—_autopyrus_. (De Vet. Med. 14.) According to\r\nActuarius, the lightest kinds of wheat form the best bread for indolent\r\npersons, but persons actively employed require the weightiest kinds.\r\nUnleavened bread, he says, is very indigestible. Bread prepared with\r\noil, he adds, is very nutritious, but requires a strong stomach to\r\ndigest it. See an interesting account of the various kinds of bread in\r\nAthenæus (Deipnos. ii, 26.) He makes the remark that the worst kind is\r\nthe most laxative. Among the kinds of bread described by ancient authors\r\nmay be noticed the _oxylipus_ mentioned by Galen (Meth. Med. viii, 5),\r\nwhich, as Manardus remarks, was prepared with vinegar. Another kind,\r\ncalled νάστος, was fermented with honey, dried grapes, &c. See Tzetzes\r\n(ad Lycoph. Casan. 640.) It is to be borne in mind that the ancients\r\ngenerally used _leaven_ to ferment their bread. Pliny, however, mentions\r\nthat the Gauls and Spaniards were in the practice of using _yeast_. (H.\r\nN. xviii, 7.)\r\n\r\nThe zea, typha, and olyra of the Greeks, and the far and adoreum of\r\nthe Romans, were all varieties of spelt, a species of grain bearing\r\nsome resemblance to wheat; in short, it was the _triticum spelta_ L.\r\nActuarius calls it a light, and not very nutritious grain. The chondrus\r\nwas prepared from spelt, by first separating the husks, and then breaking\r\nit down into granules. The alica was the same as the chondrus, with only\r\nthe addition of a small quantity of chalk; and, indeed, almost all the\r\nwriters on Dietetics, except our author, use them as synonymous terms. A\r\nmore complicated method of preparing them is described by Pliny, and in\r\nthe ‘Geoponics’ (iii, 7) Sprengel says that chondrus is what is called\r\n_perlgraupen_ by the Germans. It was therefore nearly the same as the\r\npearl-barley of this country, only that it was prepared from the grain\r\ncalled spelt, _triticum spelta_, and not from common barley. Galen, like\r\nour author, explains that a gruel, or decoction from it, is unwholesome,\r\nas it thickens before it is properly concocted.\r\n\r\nStarch, according to Galen and Oribasius, is lubricant, and not\r\ncalefacient like bread. They say that it is not very nutritious. Serapion\r\ngives the same account of it.\r\n\r\nGalen, Rhases, Haly Abbas, and, in fact, all the authorities, agree that\r\nbarley is of a colder nature, and less nutritious than wheat. Polenta\r\nwas prepared by first steeping the grain in water, and afterwards drying\r\nit at the fire, and grinding it down to meal. It was therefore a sort\r\nof malt. Galen, like our author, remarks that barley-meal sprinkled on\r\nwine and water, or water alone, makes an excellent beverage. Actuarius\r\nrecommends barley-water as a diluent drink in fevers. Ptisan of barley\r\nwas thus prepared: Barley was boiled until it swelled; it was then dried\r\nin the sun, and afterwards pounded and freed of its husk, and again\r\npounded but not ground. This flour was boiled with fifteen parts of\r\nwater, to which a small quantity of oil, and, when it swelled, some\r\nvinegar were added. Salt also was often added to it. It was either\r\nused as thus prepared, or it was strained, when it got the name of the\r\njuice of ptisan. (Hippocrates de Regim. in acut.; see Galen’s treatise\r\nde Ptisana.) A long-lived race of people in Chaldea are said to have\r\nsubsisted principally upon barley-bread. See Lucian (Macrobii). Galen\r\nstates that it is very deficient in nutritive properties. (De Re Alim. i,\r\n10.) According to Athenæus barley-bread was among the worst kinds of it.\r\n\r\nGalen says of oats that they are the food of horses and not of men.\r\nAëtius and Simeon Seth call them refrigerant.\r\n\r\nGalen, Dioscorides, Simeon Seth, and Serapion agree that rice is\r\nastringent, and recommend it for ulcers of the intestines. Galen reckons\r\nthe bread prepared from it next in quality to that from wheat. Simeon\r\nSeth calls it nutritious. Celsus ranks it with things of a weak nature.\r\n\r\nGalen and Serapion say that millet and panic being devoid of oily matter\r\nare desiccative, and therefore useful in defluxions of the belly. Simeon\r\nSeth says that the millet is of difficult digestion, and not nutritious.\r\nRhases directs panic to be eaten with fresh milk, butter, and sugar.\r\nPliny mentions a sweet species of bread prepared from millet. Galen says\r\nthat it is not possessed of much nourishment. He says it was only used\r\nfor bread in times of scarcity. The panic was merely a variety of the\r\nmillet, i. e. of the _panicum Italicum_. It was looked upon as inferior\r\nto the common millet.\r\n\r\nThe maza, as Zeunius explains it, consisted of the flour of toasted\r\nbarley pounded with some liquor, such as water, oil, milk, oxycrate,\r\noxymel, or honied water. Galen calls it flatulent and unwholesome food.\r\nHesiod recommends the maza, or cake prepared with milk, as an article\r\nof food during the heat of the dog-days. (Opera et Dies, 588.) In the\r\n_Prytoneum_ or House of Refuge, at Athens, persons were fed on it.\r\n(Athen. Deipnos. iv.)\r\n\r\nThe bellaria, called also placentæ, liba, and crustulæ, by the Romans,\r\nand by the Greeks πέμματα, ἴτρια, and πλάκουντες, were cakes of various\r\nkinds, prepared with flour, water, oil, honey, and sometimes fruits.\r\nSee Athenæus (Deipnos. xiv.) They were served up towards the conclusion\r\nof a banquet, as appears evident from Matron’s Parody, (in Athenæus iv.\r\n5.) The _obelius panis_, mentioned by him in the 3d book, is supposed\r\nby Ludovicus Nonnius to have been a species of pastry. According to\r\nSchweighäuser the French _oublie_ is derived from it. (Ad Athen. iii, 76.)\r\n\r\nThe _bucellatum_, mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus and Ælius Spartianus,\r\nwas a species of bread used by the Roman soldiers, and appears to have\r\nresembled our ship-biscuit. (See Not. Gronovii, in Amm. Marcell. xvii,\r\n8.) This kind of bread was called δίπυρος by the Greeks (see Hesychius),\r\nthat is to say, _bis coctus_, and hence the English biscuit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXIX.—ON PULSE.\r\n\r\nOf pulse, the lentil forms a bad chyme and melancholic humours; but\r\nespecially it, when twice boiled, binds the bowels; yet its soup, when\r\ndrunk with oil and sauce, is rather laxative. But savory or pennyroyal\r\nought to be added to it because it is flatulent. The common bean is\r\nlight, flatulent, and detergent; but the Egyptian bean is much more\r\nsucculent and excrementitious than ours. The pea is spongy, but not\r\nso flatulent. The chick-peas are flatulent and detergent, promote the\r\nformation of semen, are aphrodisiacal, and lithontriptic; when toasted,\r\nthey part with their flatulence, but are of difficult digestion. Lupines\r\nare difficult to digest and evacuate, and produce a crude chyme. The\r\nfenugreek warms and loosens the bowels when taken before a meal. Tares\r\nand fasels, having been previously macerated in water so as to shoot\r\nout roots, are laxative of the bowels when taken before a meal with\r\nsauce; and are more nutritious than the fenugreek. But the fasels called\r\n_dolichi_, when eaten green with their husks, are more excrementitious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates, Rhases, and other of the ancient authors\r\nagree, that pulse, in general, are nutritious. All held that they are\r\nflatulent, excrementitious, and aphrodisiacal. According to Plutarch it\r\nwas on account of their aphrodisiacal qualities that the Egyptian priests\r\nforbade the use of them. Some assign this as the reason why Pythagoras\r\n“ventri indulsit non omne legumen.” Apollonius Dyscolus says that he\r\ndid so because they are flatulent, difficult to digest, and occasion\r\ndisturbed dreams. (Hist. Mirab. 46.) This seems the most likely reason;\r\nbut Plutarch, Iamblichus, and Porphyry think they see more recondite\r\nmeanings in the Pythagorean interdiction. Actuarius remarks that all\r\nkinds of pulse are to be eaten in their green juicy state. In an ancient\r\nproverb, preserved by Athenæus, it is said that “figs are to be eaten\r\nafter fish, and pulse after flesh.”\r\n\r\nGalen speaks of lentils in much the same terms as Paulus. He particularly\r\ndisapproves of the practice, which he says was common in his time, of\r\neating them with sodden wine. Rhases says that they are of a cold,\r\ndesiccative, and excrementitious nature. Actuarius calls them the worst\r\nof the legumina. Athenæus mentions that the Egyptians lived much upon\r\nlentils. (iv.) Martial, in like manner, speaks of them as an Egyptian\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nAll the commentators are puzzled to determine what the ancient faba was.\r\nWe are inclined to think, with Dickson, that Theophrastus’s description\r\nof it applies best to our small bean. The Egyptian bean, according to\r\nSprengel, was the _nelumbium speciosum_. Galen mentions that beans were\r\nmuch used by the gladiators, for giving them flesh, but adds that it\r\nwas not firm or compact. Actuarius states that they are nutritious, but\r\ndissuades from using them freely, because of their flatulence. According\r\nto Celsus, both beans and lentils are stronger food than peas. Seth\r\nagrees with Galen, that the flesh formed from them is flabby and soft.\r\nGalen directs beans to be fried or boiled with onions, whereby they will\r\nbe rendered less flatulent. (De Alim. Facult. i.)\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the faseolus was the kidney-bean, or _phaseolus\r\ncommunis_ L. Harduin calls it _feverole_ in French. Rhases says that\r\nfasels are flatulent, and fatten the body. Pliny remarks that they\r\nare eaten with their husks. He alludes, we suppose, to the variety\r\nof them called Dolichi. Galen says that they are more laxative and\r\nnutritious, but not so flatulent as peas. Oribasius says that they hold\r\nan intermediate place between those substances which give much and those\r\nwhich afford little nourishment. Actuarius says they are the worst\r\nkind of beans, and that being heating and excrementitious they are apt\r\nto disorder the bowels. Tares, as Galen and Oribasius mention, were\r\nsometimes used for food during a famine.\r\n\r\nAll the authorities give peas much the same characters as Paulus does.\r\nGalen mentions the method of steeping chiches in water, and getting them\r\nto germinate before using them for food. Are the _bons vivans_ of the\r\npresent day acquainted with this method of making peas tender and soft?\r\nThe ancients were also in the practice of preparing these seeds for\r\nsowing in much the same manner. (Geopon. ii, 36.) See also Pliny (xviii,\r\n13.) We are inclined to think that Virgil alludes to this practice\r\n(Georg. i, 193); but Dr. Hunter has put a different interpretation on\r\nthis passage. The species of pea which grows plentifully in Sicily, and\r\nis called _pisum ochrys_, is said to hold a middle place as to quality.\r\n\r\nRhases remarks that lupines, being bitter, are not properly articles of\r\nfood, but medicines. They possess, he adds, little nutriment. Galen says\r\nthat they are indigestible, and therefore apt to engender crude humours.\r\nWhen eaten, he directs them to be well sweetened.\r\n\r\nGalen mentions that some took fenugreek, with fish-sauce, to open the\r\nbelly. He says it may be eaten with vinegar, wine, fish-sauce, or oil.\r\nSome, he adds, use them as a condiment to bread. Rhases gives similar\r\ndirections for using fenugreek.\r\n\r\nGalen likewise makes mention of the lathyrus and aracus, two varieties of\r\nthe chichling vetch. He says they resemble in properties the fasels. The\r\ncommon vetch was scarcely an article of food.\r\n\r\nThe sesame, that is to say, the _sesamum orientale_, or oily grain,\r\nas Galen remarks, is of an oily nature, and consequently heavy on the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nGalen speaks of linseed as having been used for food by peasants in Asia,\r\nbut adds, that it is not eaten by more refined persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXX.—ON THE SUMMER FRUITS.\r\n\r\nThe gourd is of a cold and humid nature, loosens the bowels, and gives\r\nlittle nourishment. The pompion is altogether a fruit of bad juices,\r\ncold, humid and emetic; and, when not properly digested, it occasions\r\ncholera. The seed of it is diuretic, breaks down stones in the kidneys,\r\nand is altogether very detergent. The squash has all the properties of\r\nthe pompion in an inferior degree. The cucumber is of a less cold and\r\nhumid nature than the pompion, but is more diuretic; it is difficult\r\nto digest, and its chyme is bad even when digested. Upon the whole,\r\nall this class of fruits are of a cold and humid nature, supply little\r\nnourishment, and that of a bad quality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen explains that the Fructus Horæi are those fruits which\r\ngrow up about the middle of the dog-days. He says that they all contain\r\nunwholesome juices, which, if they spoil in the bowels, are apt to become\r\ndeleterious poisons. Mnesitheus says that all these fruits supply little\r\nnourishment, but that what they give is of a humid nature, and does not\r\ndisagree with the body. (Athenæus, ii.)\r\n\r\nThe gourd (κολοκύνθη), according to Galen, is the most innocent of this\r\nclass of fruits; and yet, when it spoils in the stomach, it engenders\r\nbad juices. Diphilus, as quoted by Athenæus, says of it that it supplies\r\nlittle nourishment, is apt to spoil, dilutes the system, is readily\r\ndischarged, contains good juices, and is more savoury when taken with\r\nwater and vinegar, but more wholesome when pickled. Apicius gives many\r\nreceipts for cooking gourds. By one of these we are directed to eat them\r\nboiled, with pickle, oil, and wine. Most of the other receipts contain\r\na liberal allowance of spices and aromatics. Simeon Seth calls them\r\ndigestible and wholesome, but not nutritious.\r\n\r\nThe pompion (πέπων), according to Galen, is juicy, detergent, diuretic,\r\nand laxative. Seth recommends persons of a pituitous habit of body to\r\ndrink old wine with it, but such as are bilious to eat acid food. He\r\nremarks that it is apt to excite nausea. Actuarius says that, when\r\ndigested, pompions form a thin watery blood. Apicius directs us to eat\r\nthem and melons with pepper, pennyroyal, honey, or raisin wine, pickle,\r\nand vinegar; to which assafœtida may be added. Hippocrates calls them\r\nlaxative and diuretic, but flatulent.\r\n\r\nGalen says of the melopepon, or squash, that its juices are not so\r\nunwholesome, nor so diuretic, nor so laxative, as those of the pompion.\r\nHe adds that, although far from delicious, it is not so nauseous as the\r\npompion. On the melopepon, see Harduin’s notes on Pliny (H. N. xviii,\r\n5.) Perhaps some of the authorities may have meant the melon by the\r\nmelopepon.\r\n\r\nGalen says that some persons, from idiosyncrasy, readily digest the\r\ncucumber (σἴκυος); but he insists that it is impossible that good blood\r\ncan be formed from it, and therefore he warns against the frequent use of\r\nall such fruits. Actuarius says that it forms a crude chyme, and is of\r\na cold, humid, and indigestible nature. Celsus says that its nutritive\r\npowers are feeble. Avicenna says that its juices are bad, and prone to\r\nputrefaction.\r\n\r\nMelons are said by Averrhoes to be of a cold nature, juicy, detergent,\r\nand diuretic.\r\n\r\nOwing to the lax signification in which the names of the summer\r\nfruits are often applied by the Greek and Roman writers, we have felt\r\nconsiderable difficulty in distinguishing the articles treated of in\r\nthis chapter. This confusion is of very ancient date, for one of the\r\n_Deipnosophists_ of Athenæus complains of the difficulty he found in\r\ncomprehending the proper application of these terms, from their having\r\nbeen differently used by the authors who had treated of them. (ix, 14.)\r\nWe have been obliged for once to abandon the guidance of Sprengel, but\r\nhave done so with the greatest hesitation, and not until we had compared\r\nthe descriptions of all the Greek, Latin, and Arabian authorities.\r\nSchneider points out the confusion about the use of these terms, but does\r\nnot sufficiently clear it up in his Index to Theophrastus. Ludovicus\r\nNonnius may likewise be consulted with advantage. He supposes that the\r\npepones of the ancients were our melons; and he is also inclined to\r\nbelieve that the melopepon was a species of the same. (De Re Cibaria,\r\ni, 16.) For want of a better term, we have ventured to translate it the\r\nsquash, although we are uncertain whether the Greeks were acquainted with\r\nthis fruit, now so common in the East and in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXXI.—ON THE FRUIT OF TREES.\r\n\r\nThe fig and the grape hold the principal place among the autumnal fruits;\r\nfor their juices are of a less bad quality, and they are more nutritious\r\nthan the others.—Of these, the figs have the better juices and the more\r\nnutritious; they are laxative, diuretic, and evacuate the kidneys, and\r\nparticularly the very ripe. In like manner also the dried; but they are\r\nflatulent, and form blood which is not good; wherefore, when liberally\r\nused, they engender lice. When grapes are not evacuated, neither are they\r\ndigested, but form a crude chyme; but if evacuated their effects are more\r\nmoderate. Dried grapes are warmer than the others, more stomachic, and\r\nmore nutritious, but not so laxative. The mulberry is of a moistening\r\nnature, cools moderately, and loosens the belly when taken first, neither\r\ndoes it disagree with the stomach, but is little nutritious.—Of cherries,\r\nthe sweeter kinds loosen the belly, but are bad for the stomach; those\r\nwhich possess astringency are not so bad for the stomach, but do not\r\nevacuate the belly. The same rule will apply to the grape, the mulberry,\r\nand many other fruits; for astringents in general, when eaten or drunk\r\nat the beginning before any other food, bind the belly; but they who\r\nhave their bowels constipated from atony, and have taken beforehand some\r\narticles of food of a laxative nature, such as pot-herbs, fishes, or the\r\nlike, will find that astringents taken afterwards will, by strengthening\r\nthe bowels, evacuate downwards. The fruit of the pine called strobilus\r\nhas good juices and thick, is nutritious, but not of easy digestion. The\r\njuices of the peach are of a bad quality, turn acid, and soon spoil; and,\r\ntherefore, ought to be taken first, that they may readily pass downwards,\r\nand not spoil by remaining in the belly. The fruits called apricots are\r\nsuperior to the peaches, for they neither turn acid nor spoil so soon,\r\nand they are sweet. Of apples, the sweet are more heating, and easier\r\nassimilated than the others, especially when roasted or boiled; the\r\nacid are colder and more calculated to cut the humours in the stomach;\r\nthe austere strengthen the stomach and bind the belly, more especially\r\nquinces. Of pears, the large and ripe are more nutritious than these; but\r\nthe pomegranates are cooling, and contain little nourishment. The medlars\r\nand services are more astringent and fitted for a loose belly. Dates are\r\nstomachic, unless very fatty they bind the belly, form thick and viscid\r\nchyme, and occasion headachs. Of olives, the over-ripe (_drupæ_) injure\r\nthe stomach, and form a fatty chyme; those that are pickled and hung\r\n(_halmades et colymbades_), when eaten beforehand, whet the appetite, and\r\nloosen the belly, more especially if prepared with vinegar, or vinegar\r\nand honey. Of nuts, those called royal (walnuts) are less nutritious\r\nthan the filbert, and more stomachic. The green walnuts are more juicy\r\nand laxative; and, if you will strip off the inner membrane of dried\r\nones which have been macerated in water, they will become like the\r\ngreen. Almonds have incisive and attenuating powers, and, therefore,\r\nthey evacuate the intestines and chest, and more especially such as are\r\nbitter; and, in like manner, the pistacs, which are also more calculated\r\nfor removing obstructions of the liver. Damascenes loosen the belly when\r\neaten before food, either raw or boiled in honied water. The jujubes\r\nare of difficult digestion, injurious to the stomach, and give little\r\nnourishment. Carobs are of difficult digestion, bind the belly, and\r\nproduce bad chyme. Sycamores are decidedly of a cooling and a moistening\r\nnature. Of the citron, the outer part is acrid and indigestible, but that\r\npart which is as it were its flesh, is nutritious, and yet it is hard to\r\ndigest. The inner part, whether acid or watery, is moderately cooling.\r\nAcorns are nutritious, no less so than corn, but of difficult digestion,\r\ncontain thick juices, and are slowly evacuated. Chesnuts are in every\r\nrespect superior to them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It may be proper, in the first place, to discuss briefly the\r\nquestion respecting the proper time for eating fruit. Galen, Rhases,\r\nand Simeon Seth direct to eat fruit at the beginning of a regular meal.\r\nIt appears, however, to have been customary with the ancients, as it\r\nis in Britain at the present day, to eat all manner of fruits at the\r\n_mensa secunda_, or dessert, as we learn from many passages of Athenæus\r\nand Macrobius. Horace was fond of concluding his banquets with fruit.\r\nHe speaks of finishing a frugal repast with hung grapes, nuts, and figs\r\n(Sat. ii, 2); and in another place he says:\r\n\r\n                                “Ille salubres\r\n    Æstates peraget, qui nigris prandia moris\r\n    Finiet ante gravem quæ legerit arbore solem.”\r\n\r\n                                    (Sat. ii, 4.)\r\n\r\nWe may mention, by the way, that Galen, on the other hand, positively\r\nforbids to eat mulberries after other food, and that it appears to have\r\nbeen the general rule in ages long after the time of Galen to eat figs\r\nand grapes at the beginning of a meal. (Anonym. de Diæta, ed. Ideler,\r\nt. ii, 198.) But what Celsus says respecting the proper time for eating\r\nfruit is very much to the purpose: “Secunda mensa bono stomacho nihil\r\nnocet, in imbecillo coascescit. Si quis itaque hoc parum valet, palmulas\r\npomaque et similia primo cibo assumit.” (i, 2.) Ludovicus Nonnius, a\r\ngreat modern authority in dietetics, recommends us to eat the summer\r\nfruits, and cherries, strawberries, plums, peaches, and the like, at\r\nthe beginning; but apples, pears, nuts, chesnuts, and the like, at the\r\nconclusion of a meal; that is to say, at the dessert.\r\n\r\nThe fig was a great favorite with the ancients. Galen states that it is\r\ndecidedly nutritious, but that the flesh formed from it is not firm and\r\ncompact, like that from pork and bread, but soft and spongy, like that\r\nfrom beans. He says that figs increase the urinary and alvine discharges.\r\nAverrhoes says that they are of a hot and humid temperament, and that\r\nthey loosen the belly and strengthen the stomach. See, in particular,\r\nAthenæus (Deipnos. iii); Macrobius (Satur. iii, 20); and Haly Abbas. Haly\r\nsays that the fig is the most digestible, nutritious, and wholesome fruit\r\nof this class. Galen speaks doubtfully of dried figs.\r\n\r\nPliny devotes a whole book to the consideration of the grape and its\r\nproductions. Galen says that, like figs, grapes are nutritious, but that\r\nthe flesh formed from them is deficient in firmness and durability. He\r\nremarks that their stones pass through the bowels wholly unchanged.\r\nSimeon Seth states that the grape consists of four different substances,\r\nnamely, the membrane which surrounds it, the fleshy part, the juice, and\r\nthe stones. Of these, he says, the outer coat and the stones ought to be\r\nrejected, because they are indigestible. Plutarch and Macrobius exert\r\ntheir ingenuity to explain how it happens that must, or the fresh juice\r\nof the grape, does not intoxicate like wine. The “pensilis uva,” or hung\r\ngrape, is mentioned by Horace as an article of the dessert. (ii, 2.)\r\n\r\nGalen gives mulberries the same character as our author does. Aëtius\r\nsays that the proper occasion for them is when the stomach is hot and\r\ndry. According to Athenæus, the Siphnian Diphilus said that they possess\r\nmoderately wholesome juices, and that they afford little nourishment, but\r\nare savoury, and of easy evacuation. Haly Abbas recommends them cooled in\r\nsnow for heat of the stomach.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pliny, cherries were first imported to Italy from Pontus,\r\nby the famous Lucullus, and in his (Pliny’s) time they had become\r\nnaturalized even in Britain. This story, however, is not very probable,\r\nas they had been described more than a century before by Theophrastus;\r\nand further, Athenæus mentions that they had been noticed long before\r\nLucullus by the Siphnian Diphilus. He speaks favorably of them as an\r\narticle of food. Servius, the commentator on Virgil, states that there\r\nwere wild cherries in Italy before the days of Lucullus. Simeon Seth says\r\nthat they are of a cold and humid nature, and open the bowels. They are\r\nuseful, he adds, when the stomach and constitution are hot and dry.\r\n\r\nGalen states that the fruit of the pine contains thick and wholesome\r\njuices, but that they are not easily digested. The Siphnian Diphilus, as\r\nquoted by Athenæus, says that the strobili are very nutritious, smooth\r\nasperities of the trachea, and purge the breast. Mnesitheus, as quoted by\r\nthe same author, says that they fatten the body, and do not impair the\r\ndigestion. (Deipnos. ii.) Celsus holds them to be stomachic.\r\n\r\nOur author’s remarks on the persica are taken from Galen. Seth calls them\r\nrhodacina, a term which is generally applied to them by the Byzantine\r\nwriters, and also by Alexander Trallian. Seth says that they are cooling,\r\ndiluent, and laxative, but difficult to digest. If not the same as the\r\nmodern peach (which the commentators suspect), the persica was evidently\r\na fruit nearly allied to it.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable, but not quite certain, that the præcocia,\r\nduracina, and armeniaca, were varieties of the apricot. Galen does not\r\nuse the second of these terms, and mentions, that many held the first and\r\nthe last to be exactly the same fruit; and he, himself, in another place,\r\nforgets the distinction which he had endeavoured to establish between\r\nthem. Simeon Seth describes them by the name of βερίκοκκα, which appears\r\nto be a corruption of the Latin præcocia. See Geopon. (x, 73, and the\r\nnote of Needham); Harduin (Notes on Pliny); J. Bruyer (de Re Cibaria,\r\nxi, 13); C. Avantius (Notæ in Cœnam); Baptist. (Fier. p. 6); Ludovicus\r\nNonnius; and Sprengel (Dioscor. i, 165.) Seth says that they are fruits\r\nwhich soon spoil, and form bad blood.\r\n\r\nMala was used by the ancients as a generic term, comprehending many\r\nspecies of fruit. See an interesting account of them in Pliny (xxiii, 5);\r\nMacrobius (Saturn, iii, 19); and Athenæus (Deipnos. iii), where Diphilus\r\nthus states their general characters as articles of food: “Green and\r\nunripe apples are unwholesome and unsavoury, swim in the stomach, form\r\nbile, and occasion diseases. Of the ripe, such as are sweet are more\r\nwholesome and more laxative from having no astringency; the acid are more\r\nunwholesome and constipating, but such as have also a certain degree\r\nof sweetness become more delicious, and are at the same time stomachic\r\nfrom having some astringency.” The ancients appear to have been well\r\nacquainted with the methods of making cider, perry, and the like. See\r\nMacrobius (Sat. vii, 6), and Pliny (H. N. xiv, 19.) The Arabian authors\r\nin general speak rather unfavorably of apples.\r\n\r\nCornels, or the fruit of the _cornus mascula_, were in little request as\r\narticles of food, and yet Pliny mentions that they were sought after in\r\nhis time.\r\n\r\nThe cydonia or quinces were in great repute, not only as articles of\r\nfood, but as medicines. When unripe they are very astringent and contain\r\nmuch acid, and hence they were used in such cases as those in which the\r\nmineral acids are now generally administered. (Pliny, H. N. xxxiii, 6.)\r\nThey appear to be the “cana mala” of Virgil. Columella and Pliny describe\r\nthree varieties, namely, the chrysomala, struthea, and mustea. These have\r\nnot been satisfactorily determined. Some modern commentators have taken\r\n“the golden apples” of Theocritus and Virgil for oranges, but it is much\r\nmore probable that they were a species of quince. No ancient author has\r\nnoticed the orange.\r\n\r\nPears, according to Simeon Seth, are of a cold and desiccative nature.\r\nThey are compounded, he says, of astringency, sweetness, and sometimes\r\nof acidity; and some have a moderate degree of heating and desiccative\r\nproperties. Averrhoes gives exactly the same account of them. Of\r\npomegranates, he says, that some are sweet and some are acid; that all\r\nof them moisten, but that the sweet are of a more hot and humid nature.\r\nHomer enumerates the pomegranate among the fruits which were suspended\r\nover the head of Tantalus to tempt his appetite. (Odyss. xi, 588.) We may\r\nsuppose, therefore, that the poet held it to be a most delicious fruit.\r\nDioscorides says that the sweet pomegranates are stomachic; but that they\r\nare prejudicial when there is fever.\r\n\r\nGalen, who gives medlars and services much the same characters as our\r\nauthor, recommends them only in very small quantities. Aëtius and Seth\r\nsay that ripe medlars are somewhat heating, but that the unripe are cold,\r\nastringent, and constipating. Actuarius calls them excellent astringent\r\nmedicines, but bad articles of food. Dioscorides describes two species of\r\nmedlars, the aronia, and setanium. The first species is called azarollo\r\nby the Italians, and the other is the common species of medlar.\r\n\r\nSee an interesting account of dates, or the fruit of the palm-tree, in\r\nthe ‘Hierobotanicon’ of Olaus Celsius. The date, according to Galen, is\r\na fruit possessing a variety of characters, but having always a certain\r\ndegree of sweetness and astringency. He says, it is indigestible and apt\r\nto occasion headachs. Simeon Seth says that dates form an impure blood;\r\nand Ruffus, as quoted by him, affirms that they prove injurious to the\r\nbladder. Serapion, Rhases, and Mesue agree that the date is a cold,\r\nastringent fruit. Herodotus, Xenophon, and Athenæus make mention of a\r\nwine prepared from dates. Erotian says that a species of bread is made\r\nfrom dates, flour, and water. (Lexicon Hippocratis.)\r\n\r\nThe olive, as Pliny remarks, consists of four parts, the kernel, the oil,\r\nthe flesh, and the lees. The drupæ, mentioned by our author, were the\r\nolives quite ripe and ready to fall from the tree. The colymbades and\r\nhalmades were olives pickled with salt, &c. See Harduin (ad Plin. H. N.\r\nxv, 3.) The Siphnian Diphilus, as quoted by Athenæus, says of them that\r\nthey supply little nourishment, occasion headachs; that the black injure\r\nthe stomach, and bring on heaviness of the head; and that the pickled\r\nprove more stomachic and astringent of the belly, Galen mentions that\r\nolives were often eaten with bread before dinner in order to open the\r\nbelly. Simeon Seth says that ripe olives are moderately hot, but that the\r\nunripe are cold, desiccative, and astringent. Serapion, in like manner,\r\nsays that unripe olives are astringent. Plutarch mentions a pickled olive\r\nas a whetter of the appetite. (Sym. vi.) The ancients marked strongly\r\ntheir estimation of the olive when they set it down as being the emblem\r\nof peace, and sacred to the Goddess of Wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe Siphnian Diphilus, as quoted by Athenæus, states that walnuts\r\noccasion headach, and swim on the stomach; but such as are tender and\r\nwhite contain better juices, and are more wholesome; and that such as\r\nhave been toasted in a furnace afford little nourishment. (Deipnos. ii.)\r\nIt appears, from Macrobius, whose account of them is very interesting,\r\nthat they were eaten at the dessert. He states decidedly that the royal\r\nnut of the Greeks was the juglans or walnut. (Sat. iii, 18.) Simeon Seth\r\nsays that, when taken before other food, they are apt to prove laxative\r\nor emetic. Averrhoes says the like of them. He adds that filberts are not\r\nso apt to produce this effect. According to Rhases, they are apt to prove\r\ninjurious to the stomach and liver.\r\n\r\nThe Siphnian Diphilus says that almonds are attenuant, diuretic,\r\npurgative, and afford little nourishment; that the green contain bad\r\njuices, and are possessed of stronger medicinal properties; but that the\r\ndried are more flatulent, and apter to swim on the stomach. He adds that\r\nsuch as are tender, full, and are whitened, contain milky juices which\r\nare more wholesome. Simeon Seth says that bitter almonds are hotter, more\r\nattenuant, and more incisive than the ripe. He adds that filberts are the\r\nmost nutritious of the nuts but difficult to digest.\r\n\r\nThe pistachio nut has been long very celebrated in the East and in\r\nSicily. See Celsus (Hierobotanicon), and Brydone (Tour through Sicily.)\r\nGalen says that it possesses a certain degree of bitterness and\r\nastringency, and that it proves useful in obstructions of the liver, but\r\nthat it affords little nourishment. He adds that it is neither beneficial\r\nnor injurious to the stomach. Simeon Seth remarks that the moderns looked\r\nupon pistacs as stomachic. Averrhoes speaks highly of them. Rhases says\r\nthey are of a hotter nature than almonds. Avicenna also says of them that\r\nthey are of a heating nature. Theophrastus describes the pistachio tree\r\nas a species of turpentine, and it is now acknowledged as such.\r\n\r\nGalen states that the best damascenes are such as are large, spongy,\r\nand astringent. He adds that taken with sweet wine they tend to open\r\nthe bowels. Oribasius says that they afford little nourishment, but may\r\nbe useful for moistening and cooling the stomach. Martial calls them\r\nlaxative. It appears certain from Isidorus, that the coccymela and myxæ\r\nwere the same as the pruna or plums. The principal variety is the _prunus\r\ninsiticia_, or bullace plum.\r\n\r\nGalen says of jujubes, that they suit best with the intemperaments of\r\nwomen and children; but that they give little nourishment. Haly Abbas\r\nstates that they are cold and humid, of slow digestion, and apt to form\r\nphlegm. They are the _serica_ of Galen, who, however, also applies the\r\nother term (_zizypha_) to them. (De Alim. ii, 38.)\r\n\r\nAbu’l-fadli, as quoted by Olaus Celsius, says of the siliquæ or carobs,\r\nthat they are sweet astringent fruit. Horace speaks of them as being an\r\ninferior kind of fruit. “Vivit siliquis et pane secundo.” (Ep. ii, 1.)\r\nAnd so, also, Juvenal (Sat. xi, 59), and Persius (iii, 55.) Galen says\r\nof them that they are woody and consequently indigestible. Aëtius says\r\nthat they are of a dry and very desiccative nature, but possess some\r\nsweetness. Pliny mentions that a sort of wine was prepared from carobs.\r\n\r\nGalen says that the sycamores hold an intermediate place between\r\nmulberries and figs. He says, further, that they are sweetish, and of a\r\ndiluent and cooling nature. Dioscorides and Serapion speak unfavorably of\r\nthem as being articles of food which are only used in times of famine.\r\n\r\nThe citron, or “felix malum” of Virgil (Georg. ii, 126), was greatly\r\nesteemed by the ancients. Galen calls it fragrant, aromatic, and pleasant\r\nto the taste as well as the smell. From Theophrastus downwards, it is\r\nmuch celebrated as an antidote to poisons. See some curious information\r\nrespecting it in Athenæus (Deipnos. iii), and Macrobius (Sat. iii, 19.)\r\nSimeon Seth says that if taken in moderation it is beneficial to the\r\nstomach, but that in large quantity it proves indigestible. Serapion\r\nrecommends after eating citrons to take of anise, mastich, and wine. No\r\nGreek or Latin author has noticed the lemon. Avicenna, we believe, is the\r\nfirst author who mentions it.\r\n\r\nGalen says, in general, of the wild kinds of fruit, that they supply\r\nlittle nourishment, and that they are injurious to the stomach. The\r\nacorns, he says further, are the best of this class, being no less\r\nnutritious than the cerealia; he adds, that in ancient times men lived\r\nupon acorns; and that the Arcadians continued this practice after the\r\ncerealia were used in all the other parts of Greece. Simeon Seth says\r\nthat, although nutritious, they are difficult to digest and form crude\r\nhumours: and hence he recommends to abstain from them. It is well\r\nascertained that it was the acorns of the _quercus ilex_ which the\r\nancients used for food.\r\n\r\nGalen’s opinion of chesnuts agrees with the account given by our author\r\nof them. Simeon Seth says that they are very nutritious, but are hard\r\nto digest and evacuate from the body; and that they are flatulent and\r\nastringent. Haly Abbas describes them as a proper article of food. At the\r\npresent day, whole nations of mankind live upon chesnuts. The opinion\r\nof Mnisitheus regarding them, as quoted by Athenæus, appears to be very\r\njudicious; he says they are difficult to digest and flatulent, but\r\nsufficiently nutritious if digested.\r\n\r\nThe strawberries, or fraga, are mentioned by Virgil (Ec. iii), and Ovid\r\n(Metam. i); but they are wholly unnoticed by the Greek writers.\r\n\r\nWe consider ourselves here called upon not to pass over unnoticed the\r\nfruit of the lotus tree, which is so celebrated in ancient poetry, and\r\nis also mentioned by the historians and writers on science. It is now\r\nwell ascertained that the lotus-bread is produced by various trees in\r\nthe country surrounding the great desert of Africa. The most celebrated\r\nof these trees, or rather shrubs, is the _celtis australis_. Rennel and\r\nPark agree that its fruit is very wholesome. On the lotus, see further,\r\nEustathius (in Odyss. p. 337, ed. Rom.); Dionys. (Geograph.); Schweigh\r\n(ad Athen. Deipnos. xiv, 65.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXXII.—ON ANIMALS; AND, FIRST, OF FOWLS.\r\n\r\nThe nourishment derived from fowls is less than that from beasts, and\r\nmore especially swine, but they are of easier digestion, particularly\r\nthe partridge, godwit, pigeon, hen, and pheasant. That from thrushes,\r\nblackbirds, and small sparrows (among which are those called _pyrgitæ_)\r\nis harder; and still more so the turtle, wood-pigeon, and duck. But\r\nthe peacock is still more indigestible, harder, and more stringy. The\r\nflesh of geese and ostriches is excrementitious, and more indigestible\r\nthan any of the afore-mentioned; except their wings, which are not less\r\nwholesome than the same parts in other animals. The flesh of the crane\r\nis stringy and hard. In general, the young are more juicy, digestible,\r\nand nutritious than the aged, and are more readily evacuated by the\r\nbelly. The boiled are superior to the roasted and fricasseed; and those\r\nthat live on dry and mountainous places are more digestible and less\r\nexcrementitious than those which live in marshy places.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates states that fowls in general are drier than\r\nquadrupeds. The driest, he adds, are, first, the wood-pigeon, then the\r\ncommon pigeon, and, thirdly, the partridge, cock, and turtle. The most\r\nhumid or juicy, he says, are geese. Those which live on seeds are drier\r\nthan the others. The flesh of ducks, and of all fowls which live in\r\nmarshes, or in water, is of a more humid nature. (De Diæta, ii, 17.) In\r\nanother place, he calls the flesh of fowls one of the lightest kinds of\r\nfood. (De Affect. 46.)\r\n\r\nTheir general characters are thus stated by Celsus: “Ex iis avibus, quæ\r\nin media specie sunt, valentiores eæ, quæ pedibus, quam quæ volatu magis\r\nnituntur: et ex iis, quæ volatu fidunt, firmiores quæ grandiores aves,\r\nquam quæ minutæ sunt; ut ficedula et turdus. Atque eæ quoque quæ in aqua\r\ndegunt _leviorem_ cibum præstant, quam quæ natandi scientiam non habent.”\r\nThe character here given of water fowls has drawn upon the author the\r\nanimadversions of Dr. Cullen. But rather than suspect Celsus of such a\r\nmistake, we are inclined to believe that the text must be corrupt, and\r\nthat we ought to read _leniorem_ instead of _leviorem_. We are confirmed\r\nin this conjecture from all the other authorities, as for example,\r\nHippocrates, Galen, Aëtius, Rhases, and Haly Abbas, having stated that\r\nthe flesh of water fowls is more excrementitious than that of land fowls.\r\n\r\nOur author takes his account of fowls from Galen, or perhaps direct from\r\nOribasius. Actuarius states that fowls are much lighter, but not so\r\nnutritious as quadrupeds; that they are drier, more fibrous, and form\r\nthinner blood; and that water fowls are the more juicy and fleshy.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated the general characters of fowls as articles of food,\r\nwe shall now briefly notice a few of those which were in most esteem with\r\nthe _bons vivans_ of antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe partridge was accounted a rare delicacy at the tables of luxurious\r\nRomans. See Martial (xiii, 65.) Simeon Seth says that it is easily\r\ndigested, but ought not to be eaten the day it is killed. According to\r\nRhases, it contains thick juices, is astringent, but very nutritious.\r\nPsellus calls it savoury, nutritious, and digestible. Apicius directs it\r\nto be dressed with pepper, lovage, mint, the seed of rue, pickle, wine,\r\nand oil. As at the present day it was eaten at the dessert. (Deip. xiv,\r\n73.) Athenæus describes distinctly two species of the partridge, which\r\nseem clearly referrible to the _tetrao perdix_ and _tetrao rufus_. The\r\nlatter, or red-legged partridge, is still the common species in Italy.\r\n\r\nGalen ranks the pigeon next to the partridge in excellence. The Arabians,\r\nhowever, and, in imitation of them, Simeon Seth, calls the flesh of the\r\npigeon heating and excrementitious.\r\n\r\nThe attagen Ionicus has been celebrated by the muses of Horace and\r\nMartial. Porphyron, one of the ancient commentators on Horace, calls it\r\n“avis Asiatica inter noblissimas habita.” Harduin, who is deservedly\r\nreckoned a high authority in these matters, supposes it to have been the\r\n_gelinotte du bois_, or wood-hen. Altogether we incline to the opinion\r\nthat it was the _scolopax ægocephala_, or godwit, a water-bird still much\r\nesteemed by the epicures of the East. We further think that the _scolopax\r\nrasticula_, or woodcock, is the _scolopax_ of the ancients. It is well\r\ndescribed by the poet Nemesitanius. Athenæus quotes Aristophanes as\r\ncalling the attagen a most delicious bird. Galen, Aëtius, and Oribasius\r\nspeak of it in the same terms as Paulus. Apicius directs us to dress it\r\nlike the partridge.\r\n\r\nGalen says of the starling that its flesh is allied to that of the\r\nattagen. (Diæta. iv.) It is also mentioned as an article of food by\r\nAthenæus. (ii, 24.)\r\n\r\nPersius speaks of the thrush as being a much-esteemed delicacy. (Sat.\r\nvi.) Horace also says that there is nothing better than a fat thrush.\r\n(Epist. i, 15.) See Aristoph. (Nubes); Athenæus (Deipn. ii.) It is worthy\r\nof remark that, although the thrush be by no means a delicate morsel in\r\nthe north of Europe, it is very delicious in Italy and Spain. It feeds\r\non juniper berries, grapes, and the like. The receipts of Apicius for\r\ndressing thrushes, and other small birds, contain spices, aromatics,\r\nhoney, wine, pickle, and oil. Averrhoes says that their flesh is drier,\r\nmore aromatic, but grosser than that of pigeons. The Romans bestowed\r\ngreat pains upon feeding thrushes, as we can learn from Varro and\r\nColumella. The species commonly used by them for food was the fieldfare,\r\nor _turdus pilaris_. They also ate blackbirds. Galen speaks favorably of\r\nsparrows. Other small birds, as the lark and the siskin (_spinus_), are\r\nnoticed by Athenæus as being sometimes eaten. Galen recommends the lark\r\nin colic affections. In general, however, the small birds were reckoned\r\nindigestible. It is related of the gourmand Clodius Æsopus that, wishing\r\nto make a great display of prodigality at a feast, he caused song birds\r\nto be served up at it in place of beccafichi. See Valerius Maximus (ix,\r\ns), and Pliny (H. N. x, 71.) Even the nightingale was sacrificed to this\r\nmonstrous taste. (Horat. Sat. ii, 3, 245.)\r\n\r\nMartial intimates that when he could get a fat turtle to dine upon he was\r\nindifferent about other delicacies. According to Averrhoes, it is of a\r\nhot nature, and has a wonderful effect in sharpening the understanding.\r\nApicius directs us to dress it like the partridge. Galen states that the\r\nturtle, partridge, and all fowls which are of a dry nature, should be\r\nsuspended for a day before they are eaten.\r\n\r\nGalen mentions that the flesh of pheasants resembles that of domestic\r\nhens, but is more nutritious and savoury. Simeon Seth says that it is\r\nwholesome, easily digested, and forms good blood. Averrhoes prefers it to\r\nall other fowls. The tetrao, which is mentioned by Pliny and Athenæus, is\r\ngenerally supposed to be the bustard; but Bellonius and Ludovicus Nonnius\r\ntake it for the _fasiano negro_ of the Italians, or the wood pheasant.\r\n\r\nGalen and our author have omitted to take notice of quails. Simeon Seth\r\nsays that their flesh is heating, coarse, indigestible, and unwholesome.\r\nRhases, however, says of the quail, that in lightness it is second only\r\nto the starling; that it is not very excrementitious, nor accounted\r\nvery heating. Averrhoes says that it is of a moderate temperament, but\r\nsomewhat heating; that it is delicate, forms good chyme, and is excellent\r\nfood for persons in good health, and for convalescents. Lucretius and\r\nGalen mention that the quail can live upon hellebore.\r\n\r\nQ. Hortensius is “damned to everlasting fame,” for having first presented\r\nthe peacock at his table. (Varro, de Agricult. iii; Macrobius, Satur.\r\niii, 13; Pliny, H. N. x, 20; Ælianus, H. A. v, 25; Tertulianus, de\r\nPallio.) It came afterwards to be thought an exquisite delicacy, although\r\nHorace had declared of it that, were it not for its price, it would not\r\nbe thought superior to the common domestic fowl. (Sat. ii, 2.) Simeon\r\nSeth, like Galen and our author, says that its flesh is indigestible\r\nand excrementitious. Apicius directs us to dress it like the thrush. The\r\npoet Juvenal asserts that sudden deaths are occasioned by the indigestion\r\narising from eating peacocks, (Sat. i.) It appears, from Varro and Pliny,\r\nthat the Romans reared them in great numbers for the table.\r\n\r\nThe ostrich is often mentioned by the ancient authors as an article of\r\nfood, although, as Galen says, it be excrementitious and indigestible;\r\nand hence, most probably, it is proscribed in Scripture. Agatharcides\r\nmakes mention of a savage race of people, who were called Ostrich-eaters,\r\n(Ap. Photium.) The “afra avis,” mentioned by Horace, is said by his\r\ncommentator, Acron, to have been the ostrich. Porphyrion, however,\r\nrather supposes it to be the gallina numidica, or _guinea-hen_. It was\r\nthe same as the meleagris, which Schneider (ad Ælian. N. A. iv, 42), and\r\nSchweighäuser (ad Athen. xiv, 20), agree in referring to the pintada, or\r\n_guinea-hen_. Apicius directs us to dress it with pepper, lovage, thyme\r\nor savory, honey, mustard, vinegar, pickle, and oil. Rhases says that its\r\nflesh is very coarse.\r\n\r\nThe otis was the _otis tarda_, or bustard. Xenophon, who gives a graphic\r\ndescription of the mode of hunting it in Persia, says that its flesh is\r\nmost delicious. Galen and Simeon Seth say that its flesh is intermediate\r\nbetween the goose and the crane. Apicius gives very complicated receipts\r\nfor dressing it. It is the tetrax of Nemesianus.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the domestic fowls, says Simeon Seth, is of easy digestion,\r\nand contains good juices, especially the flesh of those which are\r\nbeginning to lay eggs. Chickens, he adds, are of easy digestion, and form\r\nblood of moderate consistence, neither very thin nor too thick: they are\r\nexcellent food for persons who do not take strong exercise. It appears\r\nfrom Martial that the Romans were fond of capons. (xiii.) Both Aristotle\r\nand Pliny mention that cocks were converted into capons by means of a\r\nheated iron.\r\n\r\nThe ficedula, called συκαλὶς by Aristotle, was much sought after by the\r\nRomans. It was the _beccafigo_ of the modern Italians, who are still very\r\nfond of it. Its flesh being fat, it was dressed with much pepper, as we\r\nlearn from Martial and Petronius Arbiter.\r\n\r\nGalen and Simeon Seth agree that the flesh of geese is indigestible and\r\nexcrementitious, and nearly allied to the ostrich. It would appear, from\r\nOdyss. xix, 536, that tame geese were reared for food in the heroic ages.\r\n\r\nAccording to Martial, the breast and neck are the only parts of the duck\r\nwhich are fit to be eaten. (Xenia.)\r\n\r\nAthenæus mentions that the swan was sometimes brought to the table.\r\n(Deipnos. ix.) Its flesh is very hard.\r\n\r\nThe crane and the stork were not regular articles of food, but Horace\r\nmentions that the latter had been used as such for the first time in\r\nhis days (Sat. ii, 2, 49); and Athenæus enumerates the former among the\r\nviands at a banquet. Psellua calls the crane nutritious, but difficult of\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nThe tongue of the flamingo (_Phœnicopterus ruber_) was reckoned an\r\nexquisite delicacy by the Roman epicures. See Martial (xiii, 71); Juvenal\r\n(Sat. ii); Philostratus (in vit. Apoll.) The favorite delicacy of\r\nHeliogabalus was the tongue of the flamingo. (Aug. Hist.)\r\n\r\nThe present is as good an occasion as we shall most probably find,\r\nof saying something regarding the use of the locust, or _gryllus\r\nmigratorius_, as an article of food. Every person will think of John\r\nthe Baptist, who lived on locusts and wild honey, in the desert of\r\nArabia. Agatharcides gives a very curious account of the _Acridophagi_\r\nor locust-eaters. He describes them as being of a very slender make, and\r\nextremely swarthy. He says they did not live beyond forty, being cut\r\noff by a sort of tick (_ricinus_) which formed in their bodies. (Apud\r\nPhotium.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXXIII.—ON EGGS.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of hens and pheasants are the best of all; those of geese and\r\nostriches not good: of all animals, fresh eggs are superior to the old.\r\nThose that are moderately boiled are most nutritive; those that are\r\nslightly boiled pass downwards most easily, and smooth asperities in\r\nthe throat. All the other kinds are difficult to digest and evacuate,\r\nand contain thick juices, except those that are said to be suffocated.\r\nThese are prepared by beating up raw eggs, sauce, wine, and oil, and\r\ncoagulating to a middling consistence in a double vessel. In this state\r\nthey are of easy digestion, and supply good juices. But of all others the\r\nfried are the worst.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author, Oribasius, and Aëtius copy their account of eggs\r\nfrom Galen.\r\n\r\nHippocrates says that they are nutritious, strengthening, and flatulent.\r\nSee also Celsus (ii, 18.)\r\n\r\nSee a curious account of the medicinal properties of eggs in Pliny. (H.\r\nN. xxix. 3.)\r\n\r\nRhases recommends to eat eggs in a soft state, with pepper and marjoram.\r\n(Cont. xxxiii.) He says that the best eggs are those of the hen and\r\npartridge, and next to them those of the duck. Those of geese, he says,\r\nshould not be eaten. (Ad Mansor. iii, 13.)\r\n\r\nThe ancients preserved their eggs in the flour of beans, chaff, or bran.\r\n(Pliny, H. N. x, 61; Columella, viii, 6; Varro, De Re Rustica, iii, 9.)\r\nPliny mentions that, if an egg be macerated in vinegar, it will become so\r\nsoft that it may be drawn through a ring without breaking. Harduin says\r\nthat he had verified the truth of this fact by experiment.\r\n\r\nHorace affirms that eggs of an oblong shape are the best:\r\n\r\n    “Longa quibus facies ovis erit, illa memento\r\n    Ut succi melioris et ut magis alma rotundis\r\n    Ponere.”\r\n\r\n                                    (Sat. ii, 4.)\r\n\r\nWe have here adopted the emendation of Bentley. The commentator Acron,\r\nhowever, read _alba_, but took it in the same sense as _alma_.\r\n\r\nThe ancients used to begin their banquets with eggs, and hence the\r\nexpression “ab ovo ad malum;” that is to say, from beginning to end of a\r\nbanquet.\r\n\r\nGalen and Simeon Seth agree that eggs which are boiled hard, or which\r\nhave been roasted in ashes until they are hard, become indigestible, and\r\nsupply heavy nourishment to the body; but such as have been fried they\r\nmore especially condemn. When boiled to such a consistence as that the\r\nwhite was just beginning to coagulate, they were called tremula. When so\r\nsoft that the albumen was not all coagulated, they were called sorbilia.\r\nIn both these states they are much approved of by Galen, Seth, and all\r\nthe authorities. Galen especially commends the eggs of the hen and of the\r\npheasant. Those of the goose and ostrich, he says, are inferior.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXXIV.—ON BEASTS.\r\n\r\nAmong quadrupeds, swine’s flesh is more nourishing than any other food,\r\nbecause it is most nearly allied to the human in taste and smell, as\r\nsome have declared who have tasted human flesh by mistake. But the\r\nnourishment derived from it is viscid and imperspirable. That from sheep\r\nis excrementitious, and supplies bad juices. That from goats is acrid,\r\nand has bad juices. But the worst of all is the flesh of the buck-goat\r\nas to the quality of its juices and to digestion. That of oxen forms\r\nmelancholic humours; that of hares has thick juices, but less so than\r\nthat of sheep and oxen. That of roes is hard and of difficult digestion.\r\nIn general, the flesh of young beasts is more humid, more tender, and\r\nmore digestible than that of the aged; of gelded animals than of those\r\nhaving testicles; and of the well-fed than of the lean.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Athenæus remarks that the flesh of beasts, especially oxen,\r\nformed the principal part of men’s food in the heroic ages, as appears\r\nfrom Homer. From one passage in the Iliad (xxiv, 263), and another in\r\nthe Odyssey (ix, 220), it may be reasonably conjectured that they also\r\nlived upon lambs and kids. (Deipn. i, 19.) We may add, that Sophocles\r\nrepresents Philoctetes as living, while in Lemnos, upon the birds which\r\nhe killed with his fatal bow. It is generally supposed that Pythagoras\r\ninterdicted his disciples entirely from the flesh of animals; but the\r\ntruth of the matter seems to be, that he recommended a spare use of\r\nit, and allowed to eat such animals only as were used for sacrifices.\r\nSee Iamblichus and Porphyrius (De Vitâ Pythagoræ.) Plutarch, in two\r\ntreatises, discusses the propriety of eating flesh.\r\n\r\nHippocrates states the particular characters of the different kinds\r\nof flesh very correctly. He remarks that the flesh of wild animals is\r\nlighter than that of domesticated.\r\n\r\nAccording to Aristotle, the flesh of beasts which have been reared upon\r\nmarsh pasture is less wholesome than that of beasts brought up on higher\r\ngrounds. (Hist. An. viii, 12.)\r\n\r\nThe general remarks of Celsus may best be given in his own words:\r\n“Quadrupes omne animal, si lactens est, minus alimenti præstat. Omne\r\netiam ferum animal domestico levius; et quodcunque humido cœlo, quam quod\r\nsicco natum est. Deinde eadem omnia pinguia, quam macra; recentia quam\r\nsalsa; nova quam vetusta, plus alimenti habent. Tum res eadem magis alit\r\njurulenta, quam assa; magis assa, quam elixa.”\r\n\r\nGalen remarks that the fleshy parts of quadrupeds form the best blood.\r\nWhen boiled, he says, it supplies the body with more juicy, and when\r\nroasted, with drier food. The temperament of domesticated animals, he\r\nadds, is more humid or juicy than that of wild, owing to the dampness of\r\nthe atmosphere in which they live, and their inactivity. For wild animals\r\namong the mountains being exposed to privations and fatigue, their flesh\r\nis drier, contains no fat, and is less disposed to putrefaction than the\r\nflesh of domesticated animals. He states that of all animals, whether\r\nfowls or beasts, the flesh of such as are growing is better than those\r\nwhich are past their utmost growth; that such as are at their growth hold\r\nan intermediate character; but that the flesh of such as are very young\r\nor old is bad, because, in the latter case, it is hard, dry, and fibrous,\r\nwhence it is difficult to digest, and not nutritious; while, on the other\r\nhand, the bodies of very young animals, being mucous (gelatinous?),\r\nwatery, and therefore excrementitious, readily pass through the bowels\r\nundigested.\r\n\r\nActuarius states that animals which lead an indolent life are more humid\r\nand excrementitious; whereas such as are much exercised are drier and\r\nlighter. Upon the whole, he adds, the more the colour of flesh declines\r\nfrom white, the farther is it removed from wholesomeness; it is also to\r\nbe known that wild animals are hotter and drier than domesticated.\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas says that the flesh of all animals is heating and humid, forms\r\nmuch blood, and is nutritious. Avicenna remarks that flesh strengthens\r\nthe body, and is readily converted into blood. According to Rhases, flesh\r\nis the most nutritious of all aliments, and disposes most to plethora;\r\nhence, those who live much upon it require frequent venesection,\r\nespecially if at the same time given to drinking wine.\r\n\r\nOf all kinds of animal food, pork was almost universally esteemed by\r\nthe ancients as the best. Hippocrates repeatedly speaks of it as being\r\nmost wholesome and nutritious, and Galen says the same of it in the\r\nstrongest language. He states that the athletæ, if for one day presented\r\nwith the same bulk of any other article of food, immediately experienced\r\na diminution of strength; and if the change of diet was persisted in\r\nfor several successive days, that they fell off in flesh. He adds that\r\nhe had been credibly informed by persons who had been compelled, under\r\nextraordinary circumstances, to taste human flesh, that pork bears a\r\nnear resemblance to it. Celsus praises it for its lightness: “Inter\r\ndomesticas vero quadrupedes, levissima suilla est.” Aëtius, Oribasius,\r\nand, in a word, all the Greek authorities subsequent to Galen, deliver\r\nexactly the same character of it as he. See, in particular, Simeon Seth.\r\nHe says, that the flesh of swine a year old is the best, and that very\r\nyoung pigs are not to be eaten, as being too humid and excrementitious.\r\nHe adds that the flesh of wild boars furnish the best food, being neither\r\nso excrementitious nor so viscid as that of tame swine. Martial declares\r\nhis fondness for young pigs fed upon milk. The Arabian authors display\r\n(as might be expected) their religious prejudices against the flesh of\r\nswine. Avicenna merely remarks of it that the Christians, and those who\r\nimitate them, say that the flesh of the wild boar is the best of all.\r\nAverrhoes refers to the opinion of Avicenna. Rhases, who has treated\r\nof Dietetics in three distinct works, has nowhere, so far as we can\r\ndiscover, recommended pork as an article of food. Haly Abbas, however,\r\nspeaks favorably of it; he, it would appear, being a Magian. Various\r\nreceipts for dressing pork are given by Apicius. As a sauce for the flesh\r\nof the wild boar, he recommends a composition of honey, pickle, sodden\r\nwine, and raisin wine. The wild boar is mentioned as a favorite delicacy\r\nof the Roman epicures by Juvenal and other writers of that age. Cato, the\r\nCensor, gives very sensible directions for the preparation of ham. (De\r\nRe Rusticâ, 162.) It will be perceived that our author states that pork\r\nis imperspirable. Sanctorius confirms the truth of this statement. Both\r\nCicero and Porphyry quote the saying of Chrysippus, that a soul or living\r\nprinciple was given to swine, as a sort of salt, to preserve their flesh\r\nfrom putrefaction for the use of man.\r\n\r\nMutton was no great favorite with the ancients. Galen, Aëtius,\r\nOribasius, and Simeon Seth agree with our author, that it is inferior\r\nto pork, as being more excrementitious, and containing worse juices.\r\nAverrhoes, however, accuses Galen of being prejudiced against the flesh\r\nof wethers and lambs, which, he affirms, are inferior only to kids in\r\nexcellence; he even speaks favorably of the flesh of rams. (Collect. v,\r\n32.) Rhases ranks mutton as second only to kid. Seth says that the best\r\nmutton is that of a sheep a year old. Apicius gives full directions for\r\ncooking mutton and lamb. (viii.)\r\n\r\nAll the ancient authorities speak of goats’ flesh in much the same terms\r\nas our author; namely, as being acrid, and containing unwholesome juices.\r\nHippocrates says it has all the bad qualities of beef. That of buck-goats\r\nis said by Galen to be particularly bad; and, next to it, those of rams\r\nand of bulls. Of kid, he speaks favorably, as being next in excellence\r\nto pork; then he ranks veal. But lamb, he says, is humid, gelatinous,\r\nand mucous. Rhases and Averrhoes rank kid first, and then lamb. The poet\r\nHesiod recommends kid as a delicious article of food during the heat of\r\nsummer. (Op. et Dies, i, 590.) According to Athenæus, kid imparts more\r\nfirm and substantial nourishment to the body than any other kind of\r\nflesh, not even excepting pork and lamb. (ix, 66.)\r\n\r\nThe Arabians mention the gazelle (_antelope dorcas_) as being nearly\r\nallied but superior to the goat. Simeon Seth says that the flesh of the\r\ndorcas is better than that of any other wild animal, and that it is\r\nallied to the human body.\r\n\r\nHippocrates calls beef a strong, astringent, and indigestible article of\r\nfood. Celsus ranks it among the articles which are not apt to spoil in\r\nthe stomach. Oribasius says, that it is more than moderately nutritious,\r\nbut imperspirable, and forms thick blood. Like Galen and our author, he\r\nsays that it proves injurious to those who are subject to collections of\r\nblack bile. Seth says that it is difficult of digestion and distribution,\r\nbut when digested, sufficiently nutritious. Rhases says, that it supplies\r\nmuch nourishment of a gross nature, and forms thick blood. Averrhoes says\r\nthat the flesh of heifers is good, not being so viscid, cold, and dry\r\nas the flesh of oxen. The sauces recommended by Apicius for the flesh\r\nof oxen and heifers contain various spices, and aromatics with vinegar,\r\npickle, and oil.\r\n\r\nThe glis is mentioned as a favorite delicacy of the Romans by Varro,\r\nPliny, Martial, Galen, and Ammianus Marcellinus. We learn from Varro that\r\nit was regularly reared for the table. (R. R. iii, 15.) It is the _glis\r\nesculentus_ or rellmouse.\r\n\r\nAll the authorities agree that the flesh of the stag or roe is difficult\r\nto digest. Hence Rhases forbids it, except after hard exercise. Simeon\r\nSeth adds that, as in summer, stags frequently eat poisonous serpents,\r\nit may be dangerous to take of their flesh at that season. Celsus\r\nappears to have had a more favorable opinion of venison than most of\r\nthe ancient authorities, for he ranks “omnis venatio” among the things\r\nwhich agree best with the stomach. Seth says that hare is sufficiently\r\nnutritious, if properly digested, but that it disagrees with persons\r\nof a dry temperament, and is apt to form melancholic humours. The poet\r\nMartial also praises it extravagantly. Apicius gives many complicated\r\nreceipts for dressing hares. Pliny remarks that there never is any fat on\r\nhares. (Hist. Nat. xi, 85.) Hippocrates says that their flesh is dry and\r\nastringent. Horace frequently praises the shoulder of the hare. (Sat. ii,\r\n4, 44.) In our days, the loins are preferred. The cuniculus, or rabbit,\r\nwas greatly esteemed in Spain, but does not appear to have been much used\r\nby the Greeks or Romans.\r\n\r\nGalen says the ass was eaten in times of scarcity, but was not a regular\r\narticle of food. Xenophon, however, mentions, in the 1st book of the\r\n‘Anabasis,’ that the flesh of the wild asses caught in the Syrian desert\r\nwas most delicious. Martial also speaks of the wild ass as being tender.\r\n(Epigr. xiii, 97.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXXV.—ON THE PARTS OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nThe extremities are tendinous, without fat and without flesh; and are\r\ntherefore viscid, contain little nourishment, and are laxative of the\r\nbelly, except those of birds owing to their great dryness. The snout and\r\nears are gristly and indigestible. The tongue is spongy, full of blood,\r\nand gives little nourishment. The glands are sweet and friable; and those\r\nof the breast are sweeter than the others, and, in particular, those of\r\nswine which are giving milk. These are no less nutritious than the flesh.\r\nThe kidneys and testicles are strong-smelled and indigestible, but those\r\nof cocks fed upon grain are sweet, and supply a good nourishment to the\r\nbody; whereas those of bulls, buck-goats, and rams are indigestible, and\r\ncontain bad juices. The brain produces phlegm, thick and bad chyme, is\r\ndifficult to evacuate and digest, injurious to the stomach, and occasions\r\nnausea; but when properly digested it is sufficiently nutritious.\r\nThe marrow is oily and sweeter than the brain, but in other respects\r\nresembles it. Fat and suet contain little nourishment, and are hurtful\r\nto the stomach. The heart and liver contain thick juices, are difficult\r\nto digest and evacuate. But the liver of swine is better. The spleen\r\ncontains bad juices, and occasions melancholic humours. The lungs are\r\nmore digestible as being spongy, but contain less nourishment and form\r\nphlegm. The stomach, womb, and intestines are hard, indigestible, and\r\nform phlegm. In general, the nourishment from wild animals is drier and\r\nless excrementitious than that from tame. All blood is of difficult\r\ndigestion, especially the thick and melancholic, as is that of oxen; but\r\nthat of hares is esteemed very delicious, and many are in the practice of\r\nboiling it with the liver, and some with the other viscera. Some eat also\r\nthat of young swine; and even Homer was aware that the blood of goats is\r\neaten by certain people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Since our author has stated very distinctly the characters of\r\nthe parts of animals (having abridged the fuller account of Galen), it\r\nwill serve no purpose for us to enlarge upon every one of these articles;\r\nand, therefore, we shall be content with making a few cursory remarks.\r\nFor further information, see Galen (de Alim. Facult. and de Euchym.);\r\nOribasius (Med. Coll. v); Aëtius (ii); Rhases (ad Mansor. iii, 11); Haly\r\nAbbas (Theor. v, 22); Serapion (de Simpl. ex Animal.)\r\n\r\nGalen remarks that, as some rendered the liver of swine sweet, by feeding\r\nthem upon dried figs, so he knew some persons who were in the practice\r\nof preparing the livers of geese in like manner, by feeding them upon\r\nmilk, by which means they were rendered not only delicious, but also\r\nvery nutritious, wholesome, digestible, and not difficult to evacuate.\r\nOribasius and Haly Abbas speak of it in much the same terms; but Haly\r\nadds that much of it ought not to be eaten at once, as it is slowly\r\ndigested. Athenæus speaks of it as a delicacy in great request at Rome.\r\n(Deipnos. ix, 32). The liver of a white goose fed upon fatty figs is\r\none of the delicacies mentioned by Horace as having been presented at\r\nthe supper of Nasidienus. (Sat. ii, 8.) See also Juvenal (v, 114), and\r\nPersius (vi, 7.) If we may believe Martial, the liver, in these cases,\r\nsometimes grew to such a size as to surpass the body of the animal.\r\n(Epigr. xiii, 58.) We are informed by Pliny, that it was disputed to\r\nwhom the culinary art was indebted for the discovery of this exquisite\r\ndelicacy. (H. N. x, 21.)\r\n\r\nGalen states that all fat and suet are of an oily nature, and that they\r\nought rather to be used as condiments than as articles of food. Serapion\r\ngives the most circumstantial account of the qualities of these animal\r\noils.\r\n\r\nThe vulva or womb of a sow was esteemed an exquisite delicacy by the\r\nRomans. There were three kinds of it—that is to say, it was taken in\r\nthree different states of the animal. The first, called ejectitia, was\r\nprocured by forcing the animal to part with its young. The second, or\r\nporcaria, was the womb of the animal, taken after it had littered. The\r\nthird, called sterilis, was the womb of a sow that had never been with\r\nyoung. This last is ranked by Celsus among those things which are useful\r\nto the stomach. See Plutarch (de Esu Carnium); Pliny (Hist. Nat. xi, 37.)\r\nSimeon Seth, however, condemns it as indigestible. (See Not. Bogdani.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXXVI.—ON MILK.\r\n\r\nMilk, when digested, is nutritive, but is injurious to the gums and\r\nteeth; and, therefore, after taking it, one ought to rinse one’s mouth,\r\nfirst with honied water, and then with an astringent wine. It also\r\nproduces headach, occasions flatulence of the stomach, and hypochondria,\r\nand engenders stones in the kidneys. The more watery kind contains\r\nless nourishment, but is more laxative, while, on the other hand, the\r\nthick is more nutritive, and moves the belly less. That of the goat is\r\nof a middling consistence, as that of the sheep is thicker; and it,\r\nimmediately after the ewe has brought forth lambs, is thinner, but it\r\nafterwards becomes thicker and worse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears, from Homer, that the milk of various animals was\r\nused for food in the heroic ages of Greece. His commentator, Eustathius,\r\nremarks that it is very nutritious, and, in proof of this, relates the\r\ncase of one Philinus, who used no other food or drink. (Ad Iliad. xiii,\r\n6.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates, who often makes mention of milk as a medicine, and as an\r\narticle of food, states that it sometimes occasions the formation of\r\nstones in the bladder (de Aer., Aquis et Locis, 24); and this opinion was\r\nadopted by all the ancient authorities on medicine. Milk, he says, is bad\r\nfor those who are subject to headach, for those in fever, or who have\r\nflatulency of the bowels, with rumbling or thirst; also for those who are\r\nbilious and have bloody discharges from the bowels. He recommends it in\r\nconsumption, and during convalescence from protracted fevers. (Aph. v,\r\n64.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Galen, the thickest milk of all, and the fattest, is that\r\nof cows; the most liquid and least fat is that of the camel; and after\r\nit that of the mare, and then of the ass; the milk of goats is of a\r\nmiddle consistence, and that of sheep thicker than it. It is clear, he\r\nadds, that thick milk contains more cheese, and liquid more whey. Liquid\r\nmilk, therefore, is more laxative than thick; and, on the contrary, thick\r\nmilk is more nutritious than liquid. He mentions that whey, either alone\r\nor with a certain mixture of salt, may often be used as an excellent\r\nlaxative medicine. He states that if a goat or any other animal eat of\r\nscammony or spurge, her milk will be rendered purgative. He says that\r\nmilk is most beneficial in complaints of the chest, but most injurious\r\nin diseases of the head and hypochondrium. He, and all the ancient\r\nauthorities after him, state that milk is apt to hurt the teeth.\r\n\r\nCelsus calls milk a wholesome and nutritious article of food; but says\r\nthat it is apt to disagree with the stomach, and to prove flatulent. The\r\nlearned Varro says of milk: “Est omnium rerum quas cibi causa capimus\r\nliquentium maxime alibile, et id ovillum, inde caprinum.” (De R. R. ii,\r\n11.)\r\n\r\nAristotle arranges the milk of the camel, the mare, and the ass, in the\r\nsame order, with respect to consistence, as Galen. (H. A. iv, 20.) Pliny,\r\nevidently having in view this passage of Aristotle, says that the milk of\r\ncamels is the thinnest, then that of the mare, and that the milk of asses\r\nis the thickest. This is going further than he was justified by his\r\nauthority. He remarks that the milk of cows gives the most cheese. (Hist.\r\nNat. xi, 41.)\r\n\r\nDioscorides calls milk nutritious, laxative and flatulent. His account of\r\nits properties is interesting. (ii, 74.)\r\n\r\nAll the Greek authorities subsequent to Galen evidently copy from him.\r\nSeth says that the longer milk is kept the worse it becomes. When\r\nproperly digested, he adds, it moistens the body, induces soundness\r\nthereof, and is useful in complaints of the chest.\r\n\r\nAccording to Haly Abbas, the milk of cows is the thickest of all,\r\nand the most nutritious; that of camels the thinnest, and the least\r\nnutritious; goat’s milk is intermediate between them; the milk of sheep,\r\nintermediate between that of cows and goats; and the milk of asses,\r\nbetween that of goats and of camels. (Theor. v, 26.) Rhases enumerates\r\nthem in a considerably different order; he says that the milk of cows\r\nis the thickest, and that of asses the thinnest, while that of goats is\r\nintermediate. (Ad Mansor. iii, 15.) Averrhoes calls the milk of asses and\r\nof goats the best. See also Serapion (ex Animalibus, 457); and Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 434.)\r\n\r\nThe following remarks of Macrobius seem to us very acute and pertinent;\r\nand, if well founded, they ought to operate as a powerful consideration\r\nto every healthy mother to suckle her own offspring: “Quamobrem non\r\nfrustra creditum est, sicut valeat ad fingendas corporis et animi\r\nsimilitudines vis et natura seminis, non secus ad eandem rem lactis\r\nquoque ingenia et proprietates valere. Neque in hominibus id solum, sed\r\nin pecudibus quoque animadversum. Nam si ovium lacte hædi, aut caprarum\r\nagni forsitan alantur: constat ferme in his lanam duriorem, in illis\r\npilum gigni teneriorem.” (Saturn. v, 11.)\r\n\r\nThe Galactophagi, a Scythian nation who lived principally upon mare’s\r\nmilk, are made mention of by Homer (Iliad, xiii), and by Stobæus (Sermo,\r\nv.) Eustathius says that they made much use of a preparation from milk,\r\ncalled oxygala. (Ad Iliad, u. s.)\r\n\r\nAristotle calls butter the fat of milk, which has concreted to the\r\nconsistence of oil. (Hist. Animal.) Hecatæus, in Athenæus, calls it\r\nthe oil of milk. (Deipnos. x.) Dioscorides says that it is used for\r\ncondiments instead of oil, and in confectionary instead of suet.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXXVII.—ON THE DRINKING OF MILK.\r\n\r\nHe who drinks milk ought to abstain from all other food until it be\r\ndigested, and pass downwards. It is best therefore to drink it in the\r\nmorning, newly milked, and to take no food after it, nor any hard\r\nexercise, because this would make it turn acid. But it is better to walk\r\nabout gently, and rest between, without sleeping. After doing this, the\r\nfirst part will be evacuated, and then one may drink another part, and\r\nwhen it is evacuated another may be taken. At first, therefore, it purges\r\nproperly, not indeed from the general system, but what was contained in\r\nthe belly. Afterwards it enters the veins, and nourishes excellently,\r\nand is no longer evacuated. In bilious defluxions, and colliquative\r\ndiarrhœas, the milk should be given boiled. Boil it at first gently, and\r\nfor a short time, so that none of it may run over, and that part of it\r\nmay be consumed. Afterwards it may be boiled more and more, taking care\r\nnot to burn it, nor convert it into cheese. This will be best guarded\r\nagainst by boiling it softly, and clearing away what is separated by the\r\nagitation. It may be agitated with a smooth and slender reed; and, if\r\nit froth at the lips, this may be cleared away with a sponge, for often\r\nthe part there spoils all the rest. The milk then, as is said, ought to\r\nbe boiled until it become thicker and sweeter than the raw. And the thin\r\nand serous part may be dissipated by putting heated pebbles into the\r\nmilk. This is beneficial in defluxions of the belly, and particularly in\r\nbilious ones.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This account of the process of administering milk is taken\r\nfrom Oribasius, who, in his turn, is indebted to Ruffus. Avicenna, in\r\nlike manner, copies from Ruffus. There is not in any other ancient\r\nauthor so full a description of the process of boiling milk. On the\r\nancient modes of preparing milk for various purposes, and their uses,\r\nsee ‘Geopon.’ (xviii), and Pliny (Hist. Nat. xxviii, 38.) Pliny mentions\r\nthat some cure gout in the hands and feet by milk. Simeon Seth joins our\r\nauthor, or rather Ruffus, in recommending boiled milk in dysentery. He\r\nlikewise praises its effects in phthisis and dry coughs.\r\n\r\nThe method of preparing milk for use by putting heated stones into it,\r\nis mentioned by Dioscorides, Pliny, and others. Serapion recommends\r\nheated iron. See the following Section. Galen was aware that milk\r\ncoagulates in the stomach before it is digested. (De Al. Fac. iii, 15.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXXVIII.—ON CURDS AND WHEY.\r\n\r\nBy powerful boiling at a strong fire without smoke, the serous part of\r\nthe milk is separated from the caseous, and is then strained through\r\na sieve or piece of rag carefully, and to the serous part is added a\r\nmoderate quantity of honey, or of vinegar and honey, or salts; and it is\r\ngiven to evacuate the bowels in the quantity of two sextarii to adults,\r\nand to younger persons not less than a sextarius. And milk thickened by\r\nignited pebbles or iron may be given with advantage for dysenteries and\r\nalvine discharges.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The method of preparing the schiston is thus described by\r\nPliny: “Medici speciem unam addidere lactis generibus, quod schiston\r\nappellavere. Id fit hoc modo: fictili novo fervet caprinum maxime,\r\nramisque ficulneis recentibus miscetur, additis totidem cyathis mulsi,\r\nquot sint heminæ lactis. Cum fervet, ne circumfundatur, præstat cyathus\r\nargenteus cum frigida aqua demissus ita ne quid infundat: ablatum deinde\r\nigni refrigeratione dividitur et discedit serum a lacte.” (Hist. Nat.\r\nxxviii, 33.) The same process is briefly described by Dioscorides (ii,\r\n77.) Pliny recommends the whey thus prepared for epilepsy, melancholy,\r\nparalysis, leprosy, elephantiasis, and arthritis. This preparation of\r\nmilk is often noticed by the ancient authors on medicine. It evidently\r\nconsisted of the whey of the milk, separated from the cheese by a\r\npeculiar process.\r\n\r\nThe melca was a preparation from milk, and is mentioned by our author in\r\nthe Fourth Book § 27. It also appears to have been a sort of curds and\r\nwhey, or _du lait caillé_ of the French, prepared by pouring hot vinegar\r\nupon milk. The process is minutely described in the Geoponics (xviii.)\r\n\r\nThe oxygal, or lac acidum, consisted of the caseous part of the milk,\r\nseparated from the whey by a very complicated process, which is fully\r\ndescribed by Columella. (xii, 8.) It is said by Galen to possess very\r\nrefrigerant properties.\r\n\r\nThe aphrogala, or spuma lactis, appears to have been milk reduced to a\r\nstate of foam by violent agitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXXIX.—ON CHEESE.\r\n\r\nAll cheese is acrid, occasions thirst, is difficult to digest, forms bad\r\nchyme, and engenders stones. That is best which is new, spongy, soft,\r\nsweet, and has a moderate share of salt. The opposite kind is the worst.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates calls cheese flatulent and indigestible. Celsus\r\nalso calls it flatulent, and ranks old cheese among the unwholesome\r\narticles of food. He speaks favorably, however, of soft new-made cheese.\r\nDioscorides, in like manner, says that new-made cheese without salt is\r\nnutritious, good for the stomach, of easy distribution, forms flesh,\r\nand is moderately laxative. Old cheese, he adds, is constipating. Pliny\r\ndescribes the kinds in most repute when he lived. (Hist. Nat. xi, 97.)\r\nHe says that salted cheese wastes the body, but that soft is nutritious,\r\n(xxviii, 34.) Varro, in like manner, says that soft and recent cheese is\r\nnourishing, and not astringent, but that the old and dry is the contrary.\r\n(De R. R. ii, 11.) The spongy cheese prepared from the first milk of a\r\ngoat was reckoned very delicious. It was called colostrum. (Martial,\r\nEpigr. xiii, 33.)\r\n\r\nGalen’s account of the nature and properties of cheese is so ample that\r\nour limits will not admit of doing justice to it in our brief abstract.\r\n(De Alim. iii, 17.) He remarks that milk, when it is converted into\r\ncheese, loses its watery part, and acquires heating properties, whence it\r\nbecomes more apt to excite thirst, more indigestible, and unwholesome.\r\nHe speaks most favorably of new-made cheese, and mentions that there was\r\na kind much used by rich Romans, called Vatusicus, which was peculiarly\r\nexcellent. As to consistence, the best cheese, he remarks, should be\r\nintermediate between the glutinous and the friable, and it ought to\r\npossess no distinct quality as to taste, unless, perhaps, a certain\r\ndegree of sweetness. Aëtius, Oribasius, and Simeon Seth evidently adopt\r\nthe views of Galen. Seth says that new cheese is laxative, and old\r\nastringent.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians deliver the same characters of cheese as their Grecian\r\nmasters. Avicenna, Averrhoes, and Haly Abbas speak favorably of new\r\ncheese, as being of a cold and humid nature.\r\n\r\nHippocrates mentions a species of cheese prepared by the Scythians, from\r\nmares’ milk, and called by them hippace. (De Aer.) The same is noticed by\r\nTheophrastus (Hist. Pl. ix), and by Pliny (Hist. Nat. xxv, 44.) Cheese\r\nvariously prepared and served up was esteemed a great delicacy by the\r\n_gourmands_. See Athenæus (ix, 14.) It was taken towards the conclusion\r\nof a feast. (Id. xv, 22.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XC.—ON FISHES.\r\n\r\nThat all fishes are of a colder and more humid temperament is obvious.\r\nThose that are found among rocks are the best of all, being of easy\r\ndigestion, furnishing good juices, and being moderately moistening when\r\ntheir flesh is not hard. Of those that do not abide among rocks, those\r\nthat abide in the sea are much better than those that dwell among mud,\r\nor where rivers meet the sea. But still worse are those which are found\r\nin marshes and stagnant parts of the sea. In particular, the mullet\r\n(_capito_) being a sea fish, is moderately sweet, not very indigestible,\r\nand furnishes good chyme; but the blood formed from it is thin and weak.\r\nSo it is also with the bass (_lupus_). The surmullet, as being a sea\r\nfish, is harder than the others, friable, digestible, nutritive, sweet,\r\nand free of fat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Ancient authors make mention of whole nations of mankind\r\nthat subsisted entirely upon fish. For an account of the Ichthyophagi,\r\nsee Herodotus (iii, 20); Pliny (xi); Strabo (Geogr. xv); Diodorus\r\nSiculus (iv, 15); Ptolemæus (Geogr. iv); Arrianus (in Indicis); Solinus\r\n(Polyhistor, lxv); Philostratus (in Vita Apollonii, iii.) The description\r\ngiven of them by Diodorus is the most circumstantial and interesting. He\r\nsays that the simplicity of their diet preserved them free from diseases,\r\nbut that they were short-lived. A very interesting, and seemingly a very\r\nauthentic account of the fish-eaters on the borders of the Red Sea is\r\nalso given by Agatharcides. (Ap. Photium.) Pliny states that fish was\r\nused by his countrymen as food from the building of the city. (Hist. Nat.\r\nxxxii, 10.) Eustathius says that, in the heroic ages, it was seldom used\r\nbut in cases of want. (Ad Iliad. v, 487.) It would appear that fish was\r\ngenerally high priced in Greece. See Athen. (vi, 12, ed. Schweigh.) In\r\nthe luxurious days of the Romans, the rage for fishes esteemed as rare\r\nwas excessive. See Horace, Juvenal, and Martial (pluries.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates thus details the dietetical qualities of fish. Speaking\r\ngenerally, then, he says fishes are light food, both when boiled and\r\nroasted, by themselves or with other things. They differ from one another\r\nas follows: Those which live in lakes, the fat, and river fishes, are\r\nheavier; of sea fish, such as are found near the shore are lighter, and\r\nthose which are well boiled are lighter than such as are roasted. The\r\nstronger kind, therefore, are to be given when our object is to recruit,\r\nbut the lighter when we wish to attenuate or reduce. (De Affect. 46.)\r\n\r\nCelsus ranks fish among those things which hold an intermediate place\r\nbetween articles of a strong and of a weak nature. He thus distinguishes\r\nthem from one another: “Levior piscis inter saxa editus, quam in arenâ,\r\nlevior in arenâ, quam in limo: quo fit ut ex stagno, vel lacu, vel\r\nflumine eadem genera graviora sint: leviorque, qui in alto, quam qui in\r\nvado vixit.”\r\n\r\nPlutarch states that fish is much more easily digested than flesh.\r\n(Sympos. iv.)\r\n\r\nFor a full, interesting, and judicious account of the qualities of fishes\r\nas articles of food, see Athenæus (Deipnos. viii.) We can only afford\r\nroom to mention his opinion of their more general properties. He says,\r\nthen, upon the authority of the Siphnian Diphilus, that of sea fishes\r\nthose that live among rocks are of easy digestion, contain good juices,\r\nare detergent, light, and afford little nourishment; and that those which\r\ninhabit the depths of the sea are difficult to digest, very nutritious,\r\nand of difficult assimilation.\r\n\r\nGalen states that fishes which live in marshes, lakes, and muddy rivers,\r\nare the worst as articles of food, because they are little exercised in\r\nswimming, and have impure food. Such fishes as live in the depths of\r\nthe sea, he says, are almost free from fault as aliment, for they are\r\nmore wholesome and delicious than any of the others. He mentions, as\r\nthe characteristics of good fish, that they have no offensive taste or\r\nsmell, have little fat, and can be kept for a considerable time without\r\nbecoming putrid, especially if put in ice. He says that fish is the best\r\npossible food to persons of indolent habits, old men, and invalids, but\r\nthat it does not answer so well with persons who take strong exercise.\r\n\r\nOf fishes, as aliments, there is an excellent account in a Fragment\r\nof Xenocrates, published a few years ago, with interesting notes, by\r\nthe learned Dr. Coray, of Paris. He says that roasted fishes are most\r\nnutritious, but are of difficult evacuation; that the boiled are less\r\nnutritious, but are readily evacuated; that sea fishes are savoury, agree\r\nwith the stomach, are of easy distribution, form proper blood, impart a\r\ngood colour, and clear the bowels. Such as live in rivers and lakes, he\r\nadds, are bad for the stomach, form thick juices, and are of difficult\r\nevacuation. The characters of the different fishes are afterwards stated\r\nby him very fully. He says that the parts next to the tail, as being most\r\nexercised, are most wholesome.\r\n\r\nOribasius’s account of fishes is mostly taken from Xenocrates. Aëtius is\r\nfull and correct on this subject. He says that the best fishes are those\r\nwhich live in a sea of pure water, especially if it be agitated by winds,\r\nand if its shores be sandy, and not clayey.\r\n\r\nActuarius says, that of fishes which live at the sea-shore, and among the\r\nrocks, the larger supply much nourishment, of a thick nature; and the\r\nsmaller, little nourishment, of a pure nature. He says, further, that sea\r\nfishes in general, being preferable to those which live in fresh waters,\r\ndiffer however from one another in several respects; that such as live in\r\nthe open sea are more exercised, and enjoy purer food, than the others,\r\nand hence their flesh is firmer and purer, and they are more nutritious,\r\nand form thick blood; that such as live in canals and marshes are bad and\r\nunwholesome; and that those which live among rocks in pure waters have\r\nbetter flesh, and, being light and digestible, form thin and pure blood.\r\n\r\nSimeon copies freely from Galen and our author. Upon the whole, he says,\r\nthe blood which fishes form is thinner than that from land animals. Fish,\r\nhe says, is the most proper food of invalids and convalescents.\r\n\r\nAlexander Aphrodisiensis discusses the question why rock fishes are\r\npeculiarly excellent, and decides that it is because the water about\r\nrocks is constantly in motion, which keeps the fishes there in perpetual\r\nexercise. (Prob. ii, 82.) He would appear to have had in view Galen, (de\r\nFacult. Alim. iii, 20.) Considering that rock fishes are particularly\r\ncommended by all the authorities on dietetics, both Greek and Arabian,\r\nit has justly excited the wonder of Joannes Bruyerinus Campegius and\r\nLudovicus Nonnius, two very learned writers on the _Res Alimentaria_ of\r\nthe ancients, that Celsus should rank the “pisces saxatiles” among the\r\n“res mali succi.” (ii. 21.) This appears the more remarkable, as he had\r\npreviously (18) classed “omnes sexatiles” among the “res leviores,” and\r\nhad said again of them, “levior piscis inter saxa editus, quam in arena.”\r\nTaking all this into consideration, we cannot hesitate in coming to the\r\nconclusion that in the passage first quoted the text must be in fault.\r\nWe beg to offer, as a conjectural emendation, “fluviatiles.” Galen,\r\nXenocrates, Psellus, Seth, and other authorities, agree in condemning\r\nriver fishes, with the exception of those that run up from the sea. We\r\nmay further mention, as tending to confirm this conjecture, that the same\r\ncharacter of river fishes is given by the great Italian authority on\r\ndietetics, Domenico Romoli. (See Singulare Dottrina, &c. vii, 50.)\r\n\r\nRhases states that sea and river fishes are the best, especially such\r\nas have rough scales, are not mucilaginous, and are naturally of a\r\nwhite colour. Those, he adds, which are of a black or red colour should\r\nbe abstained from. He says that all fish remains long in the stomach\r\nundigested. It is now generally admitted that it is less digestible than\r\nthe tender flesh of quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nAvicenna delivers the general characters of fishes in the same terms as\r\nGalen. He says that the best are those the flesh of which is neither too\r\nhard and dry; nor, on the other hand, too mucilaginous; and which are\r\nneither very large nor very small. Averrhoes repeats this account of\r\nthem. Haly Abbas, in like manner, abridges Galen. He says that fresh fish\r\nis of a cold and humid nature, and engenders phlegm.\r\n\r\nThe ancients ate their fish either roasted, boiled, fried, or in soups.\r\nInvalids were recommended to take them boiled. The fried were believed to\r\nsuit only with persons of a strong constitution.\r\n\r\nWe shall now offer a few remarks upon the fishes which were in most\r\nrequest at the tables of the ancients.\r\n\r\nThe labrax, or lupus, has been taken for the pike. But Aristotle,\r\nOppian, and Cassidorus describe it as being a cunning fish, which does\r\nnot accord with the character of the pike. Bochart concludes that it is\r\nthe fish called λαύρακι, by the modern Greeks; _varolo_, by the Italians;\r\nand _bar_, by the French. It seems indisputable that it was the bass, i.\r\ne. _labrax lupus_ Cuvier. Icesius, as quoted by Athenæus, says of it,\r\nthat it contains good juices, but is not very nutritious, nor readily\r\nevacuated, but is the most delicious of all fishes. Archestratus calls it\r\n“the offspring of the gods.” All the authorities, in a word, speak highly\r\nof it. Lupi caught in the Tiber were esteemed the best. See Horace (Sat.\r\nii, 2,) and Macrobius (Saturn. iii, 16.) There were two species, the\r\nlanatus and the varius, of which the former was in most esteem.\r\n\r\nThe pike is unquestionably the “_lucius_” of Ausonius (_Mosella_); but it\r\nseems doubtful whether it be noticed by the Greek writers. The _hepatus_\r\nwould seem to be a congener. Galen says its flesh is intermediate between\r\nthe soft and the hard.\r\n\r\nThe barb (_cyprinus barbus_ L.) is not described by the Greeks, but is\r\nmentioned by the Latin poet Ausonius (l. c.) who says of it that it is\r\nthe only fish which is improved by age.\r\n\r\nThe rhombus was esteemed a remarkable delicacy. The classical reader will\r\nrecollect the ludicrous importance attached to the capture of one by the\r\nflatterers of Domitian, as described in the 4th Satire of Juvenal. It is\r\nfrequently made honorable mention of by Horace and Martial. According to\r\nHarduin and Nonnius, it was the turbot, yet not the common turbot of this\r\ncountry (_pleuronectus maximus_), but the species called _carrelet_ in\r\nFrench (_P. rhombus_ L.) Athenæus calls it sweet and nutritious. Celsus\r\nranks it among “res boni succi.” According to Athenæus, it is the same as\r\nthe ψήττα of Aristotle. It is, we suppose, the ψίσσα of Alexander (ii,\r\n6.) It is the ψίσιον of Seth (V. Notæ Bogdani). He calls it wholesome and\r\nof easy digestion.\r\n\r\nThe cephalus was a species of the mullet, as is stated by Harduin (ad\r\nPlinii Hist. Nat. ix, 26); Schneider (ad Æliani Nat. Anim. i, 12); and\r\nLudovicus Nonnius. It is the _mugil cephalus_ L. Oppian describes the\r\nfishing of it in the most striking manner. Galen remarks that the flesh\r\nof it differs much in quality, according to the nature of the place in\r\nwhich it is found. Athenæus ranks it among the fishes which are sweet\r\nand nutritious. Simeon Seth and Aëtius say that the river mullet is\r\nbad for the stomach, indigestible, and apt to form phlegm. It appears\r\nfrom Anaxilas, as quoted by Athenæus, that its head was in most repute.\r\nArchestratus says that it is best in the winter season.\r\n\r\nThe trigla, or mullus, as Nonnius, Harduin, Schneider, and Coray state,\r\nwas the surmullet, or _mullus barbatus_ L. It is mentioned as a rare\r\ndelicacy of great price by Horace (Sat. ii, 2); Juvenal (Sat. iv, 15);\r\nMartial (Xenia, 74); and Macrobius (Saturnal. iii, 16.) Athenæus says of\r\nit, “Diocles writes that the flesh of the mullus is hard.” (vii, 21.) Its\r\nliver prepared with oil and wine is said by Galen to have been esteemed\r\nas a peculiar delicacy.\r\n\r\nWe need not say how much the murene was sought after by all the lovers of\r\ngood eating in ancient Rome. Pliny, Martial, and Macrobius inform us that\r\nthose from Sicily were in most esteem; and Brydone takes notice of the\r\npeculiar excellence of the Sicilian murenes at the time when he performed\r\nhis tour through that island. According to Icesius, it is as nutritious\r\nas the eel. (Athen. vii.) He mentions that the murene was called “the\r\nHelen of suppers;” and hence, no doubt, Linnæus has named the fish\r\n_muræna Helena_. It was held in much esteem, he says, before spawning.\r\n(Ibid.) Apicius gives various receipts for the dressing of it. Pepper,\r\nwine, vinegar, and oil are ingredients in almost every one of them. The\r\nmurene which was served up at the supper of Nasidienus had a sauce or\r\nsoup formed of such things. (Horace, Sat. ii, 8.) It is related of Vedius\r\nPollio, that he fed his murenes with the bodies of condemned slaves.\r\n(Plin. Hist. Nat. ix, 23, and Tertullian, De Pallio.) L. Crassus, the\r\norator, put on mourning clothes for the death of a murene. (Macrobius,\r\nSat. iii, 15.) The _muræna ophis_ is mentioned by Galen as having the\r\nsame character as its congener.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were acquainted with several species of mackerel (_scomber\r\nscomber_), which Xenocrates represents as nutritious, but unpalatable and\r\nflatulent.\r\n\r\nThe anguilla, or common eel, and the congrus, or conger-eel, were\r\ndespised by the Roman _gourmands_, but were greatly esteemed by the\r\nGreeks. Icesius says that eels are the best of fishes. See Athen. (l. c.)\r\n\r\nIt is supposed, by most of the classical commentators, that the\r\naccipenser was the sturgeon, but this is not quite agreed.—See this point\r\nfully discussed by Rondelet, Gesner, and Willoughby. The celebrated\r\nArtedi, and the writer of the article on Ichthyology in the ‘Encycl.\r\nMethod.’ are quite decided in the affirmative. We need have little\r\ndifficulty, then, in determining it to be the _accipenser sturio_. To\r\nour minds there can be no doubt but that it is the fish described by\r\nConstantine Porphyrogenita, under the name of βερζήτικον. (De Admin.\r\nImp. 42.) Both in the days of the Romans, and under the Greek empire,\r\nthe sturgeon was commonly procured from the Pontus or Black Sea. Its\r\npopularity appears to have been great in the days of Horace, but it had\r\nfallen into disrepute in the time of Pliny. It seems, however, to have\r\nretrieved its character afterwards; for one of the authorities quoted by\r\nAthenæus says that it was presented at the Roman banquets, crowned with\r\ngarlands, and accompanied with the playing of pipes. See also Macrobius\r\n(Sat. iii, 16.) Martial speaks of it as a much-esteemed delicacy at the\r\nimperial table. The elops and the galeus rhodius were fishes nearly\r\nallied to the sturgeon. See Pliny and Athenæus.\r\n\r\nThe isinglass fish (_accipenser huso_), although described by Herodotus\r\n(Hist. iv, 53), Strabo (Geogr.), and Ælian (xiv, 23), is not noticed\r\nby the dietetical writers, unless we suppose it the fish alluded to by\r\nAthenæus (vii, 21), where see the notes of Coray and Schweighäuser.\r\n\r\nMartial mentions the gobius, or gudgeon, as being the first of the viands\r\npresented at the banquets of the Venetians. (Xenia, Ep. 83.) Juvenal\r\nspeaks of it as being a fish of little value, or, at least, low priced.\r\n(Sat. xi, 37.) It is, in fact, as Galen states, a very small fish; but he\r\nrepresents it as being delicious, digestible, and wholesome, especially\r\nwhen caught on a stony or rocky shore. Seth gives the same account of it.\r\nDiphilus, as quoted by Athenæus, says, that when its flesh is white the\r\ngudgeon is tender, wholesome, and digestible.\r\n\r\nThe perch, according to the same authority, bears a close resemblance to\r\nthe gudgeon. Ausonius calls it the _deliciæ mensarum_. Galen calls it a\r\ndelicious fish, which is not only of easy digestion but most wholesome.\r\nHe adds that it, and other fishes of the same description, form blood\r\nof a middling consistence, that is to say, neither very watery nor too\r\nthick. Both the _perca fluviatilis_ and the _P. marina_ are described by\r\nAristotle, Galen, Athenæus, and the other writers on dietetics.\r\n\r\nThe umber (_sciæna umbra_), a fish resembling the perch, but of great\r\nsize, was in much esteem as a pickle, which was called _saperda_, and\r\nbrought from Pontus. See Athen. (iii, 31), and Persius (Sat.)\r\n\r\nThe merle (_labrus merula_) is mentioned among the rock fishes by Galen.\r\nDiocles in Athenæus says it is of easy digestion and highly nutritive.\r\nThe iülis, called _donzella_ by the Italians, a fish of the same genus,\r\nis mentioned by Galen and Xenocrates as having soft flesh.\r\n\r\nThe fish called _serran_ in French (_serranus anthius_ Cuv.), and its\r\ncongener the _labrus hepatus_ L. are briefly noticed by the dietetical\r\nauthorities as wholesome fishes.\r\n\r\nOn the _salmon_ the Greek authors are entirely silent. It is briefly\r\nnoticed by Pliny (H. N. ix, 32); but the first and only satisfactory\r\naccount of it which is to be found in any Latin classic is contained in\r\nthe Mosella of Ausonius. We shall give an extract from the lines in which\r\nit is first described:\r\n\r\n    “Teque inter species geminas, neutrumque et utrumque,\r\n    Qui necdum Salmo, nec jam Salar, ambiguusque\r\n    Amborum medio Fario intercepte sub ævo.”\r\n\r\nHere we find marked the three progressive stages in the growth of the\r\nfish. The salar is the sea-trout, the fario is what in the north of\r\nScotland is called the grilse, and the salmo is the full-grown salmon. Of\r\nthe salmon he says:\r\n\r\n    “Tu loricato squamosus pectore, frontem\r\n    Lubricus, et dubiæ facturus fercula cænæ,\r\n    Tempora longarum fers incorrupte morarum,\r\n    Præsignis maculis capitis: cui prodiga nutat\r\n    Alvus, opimatoque fluens abdomine venter.”\r\n\r\nThe sea-trout is well described in the following line:\r\n\r\n    “Purpureisque Salar stellatus tergora guttis.”\r\n\r\nNonnius considers the salmon to be the _anchorago_ of Cassiodorus. (De\r\nEsu Piscium, 31.) Gesner holds the same opinion. (De Aquat.)\r\n\r\nLudovicus Nonnius confesses his inability to determine what the scarus\r\nwas. It would seem to have been the fish now called _labrus scarus_ L.,\r\na small fish, according to Bellonius, being seldom more than a fathom\r\nlong. Xenocrates praises it as being very savoury and of easy digestion,\r\nbut of difficult distribution and evacuation. For a curious account of\r\nit, see Macrobius (Sat. iii, 16.) The sargus nearly resembles the scarus,\r\nbut is more astringent and nutritious. It is the _sparus sargus_ L., and,\r\naccording to Rondelet, is called _sargo_ by the Italians. The melanurus\r\n(_sparus m._) is very like to it in shape and qualities.\r\n\r\nThe aurata, called by Bruyer and Nonnius in French _brame de mer_; and by\r\nAinsworth and Artedi, gilt-head in English, (namely, the _sparus aurata_\r\nL.) is said by Celsus and Mnesitheus as quoted by Athenæus, to be a fish\r\nof difficult digestion but very nutritious. Xenocrates says that its\r\nflesh is firm, white, of easy distribution, and nutritious.\r\n\r\nThe passer, called platessa by Ausonius, is supposed by Artedi and\r\nNonnius to have been the plaice (_pleuronectes platessa_.) It is\r\nmentioned by Horace among the delicacies at the supper of Nasidienus. The\r\nsolea or sole, called lingualaca by Festus and Varro, was nearly allied\r\nto it. It is the _P. solea_. Diphilus says that both are very savoury and\r\nnutritious.\r\n\r\nThe lamprey (_petromyzon lampetra_ L.) is the mustella of Ausonius, the\r\nexormiston of Cassiodorus, the γαλάξιας of Galen, the ἐχένηις of Oppian,\r\nand the βδέλλα of Strabo. See Bruyer, Nonnius, and Rondelet. It was\r\nreckoned unwholesome.\r\n\r\nThe capros, or carp, is called by Archestratus “The flower of nectar.”\r\n(Athenæus Deipnos. vii.) It is the _cyprinus carpio_ L.\r\n\r\nThe hake (_gadus merluccius_) is generally supposed to be the _gadus_ of\r\nAthenæus (vii); the _asellus_ of Ovid, Varro, and Pliny; and _oniscus_ of\r\nMarcellus Sideta. It was reckoned wholesome. The ancients do not appear\r\nto have been acquainted with the _gadus eglofinus_, or haddock.\r\n\r\nAccording to Willoughby, the Latin poet Ausonius is the only ancient\r\nauthor who has noticed the tench or _cyprinus tinca_. We are inclined,\r\nhowever, to think that it is the ψύλων of Aristotle (H. A. vi, 14), and\r\nthe γναφεὺς of Athenæus (vii.) See Casaubon (l. c.), and Rondelet (de\r\nPiscibus.)\r\n\r\nWe may mention here, although somewhat out of place, that neither the\r\nGreeks nor Romans would appear to have used the _frog_ as an article of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XCI.—ON THE TESTACEA, OR SHELL-FISH.\r\n\r\nThe testacea in general form a saltish and crude chyme; but of them\r\nthe oysters have the softest flesh, and are most laxative. The chemæ,\r\npurpuræ, solenes, spondyli, buccinæ, cochleæ, and such like, are hard.\r\nAnd those covered with a soft shell (_crustacea_) such as the astaci,\r\npaguri, crabs, common lobsters, and those called squillæ, are of\r\ndifficult digestion, nutritious, and bind the belly when often boiled in\r\nsweet water. The juices of all the testacea are laxative, and therefore\r\nfrom the land snails, although their flesh be hard, indigestible,\r\nnutritious, and contains bad juices, some make a sauce, with oil and\r\npickle, which they use for opening the belly. The sea urchins (_echini_)\r\nare moderately cooling, contain little nourishment, and are diuretic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Coray correctly states in his ‘Notes on the Fragment of\r\nXenocrates,’ that, in the ancient classification of animals, the\r\nὀστρακώδη or ὀστρακόδερμα, were divided into the σκληρόστρακα, or\r\ntestacea, comprehending oysters, muscles, &c.; and the μαλακόστρακα,\r\nor crustacea, comprehending the crabs, paguri, &c. But, as he remarks\r\nafterwards, the σκληρόστρακα were often called by the generic term,\r\nὀστρακόδερμα. The ancient division of the lower classes of animals\r\nis derived from Aristotle’s ‘History of Animals’ (iv), and with some\r\nslight modifications it is the same as the classification adopted by\r\nBaron Cuvier. Pliny thus distinguishes the mollusca, crustacea, and\r\ntestacea: “Piscium quidam sanguine carent, de quibus dicemus. Sunt autem\r\ntria genera: in primis quæ mollia appellantur (_mollusca?_): deinde\r\ncontecta crustis tenuibus (_crustacea?_): postremo testis conclusa\r\nduris (_testacea?_). Mollia sunt, loligo, sepia, polypus, et cetera\r\nejus generis,” &c. In another place, however, he introduces confusion\r\nby applying the term mollia to the crustacea. This mistake probably\r\noriginated in the resemblance between the Greek terms μαλάκια and\r\nμαλακόστρακα. (Hist. Nat. ix.)\r\n\r\nWe may mention further, that, in Oppian’s delightful poem on ‘Fishing,’\r\nthe crustacea are described at book i, l. 259, the testacea at l. 283,\r\nand the mollusca at l. 638. On the terms used by Ælian, see ‘De Nat.\r\nAnimal.’ (ix, 6, ed. Schneider.) Athenæus gives a long disquisition on\r\nthese animals in the third book of the ‘Deipnosophistæ.’\r\n\r\nOf the testacea described by the ancient writers on dietetics, we are\r\ninclined to refer the chema to the genus _chema_ of modern naturalists,\r\ncomprehending several species of the cockle: the purpura to the _helix\r\nianthina_ or purple fish, in particular: the solen to the genus _solen_\r\nor bag-fish: the spondylus to the genus _spondylus_ or prickly oyster:\r\nthe buccina to the _buccinum harpa_: the cochlea to the _helix pomatia_\r\nor edible snail: the astacus to the _astacus fluviatilis_ or crawfish:\r\nthe pagurus to the _cancer pagurus_ or common crab: and the cancer to\r\nsome variety of the same: the _locusta_ to more than one species of the\r\n_locusta_ or lobster; the squilla to the _crangon vulgaris_ Cuv. or\r\nshrimp: and the leo marinus indefinitely to the genus _cancer_. We think\r\nit but right, however, to confess that our own acquaintance with this\r\ndepartment of natural history is not so extensive as to warrant us in\r\nspeaking authoritatively on these matters.\r\n\r\nWe shall now briefly notice the ancient opinions on their dietetical\r\nqualities. From Athenæus, we can only find room for the following\r\nextract: “Regarding the testacea (ὀστρακόδερμα) the Siphnian Diphilus\r\nwrites thus: ‘Of the testacea, the squilla, astacus, locusta aquatica,\r\ncancer, and leo marinus, are of the same genus, but differ from one\r\nanother: the leo is larger than the astacus; the locusta is more fleshy\r\nthan the cancer; and the cancer, or crab, is heavy and indigestible.’\r\nMnesitheus, the Athenian, in his work on ‘Dietetics,’ says, that the\r\nlocusta, cancer, squilla, and the like, are all of difficult digestion,\r\nand yet they are much easier digested than other fishes.”\r\n\r\nGalen’s account of them is interesting, and our author’s is abridged\r\nfrom it. In general, he remarks, those which have hard flesh are most\r\nnutritious, but indigestible. They all contain saltish juices which are\r\nof a laxative nature. He says of the crustacea that they have all firm\r\nflesh, and are, therefore, difficult to digest, but nutritious. Aëtius\r\nand Oribasius copy from him without the slightest alteration of any\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nFrequent mention of the squilla occurs in the works of Horace, Juvenal,\r\nand Martial, as a favorite article of food. A poet in Athenæus says it\r\nshould be prepared with fig leaves.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dioscorides and Alexander, the echinus is stomachic and\r\ndiuretic. Ælian, in like manner, calls it a restorative to a weak\r\nstomach. (N. A. xiii.)\r\n\r\nActuarius says that the crustacea hold an intermediate place between the\r\nfishes and mollusca; that they are, therefore, not so digestible as the\r\nmollusca, and form purer and thinner blood; that the testacea, as they\r\nget no exercise, are less proper; and that all form a thin and watery\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nWe need scarcely remark, that the Romans esteemed the cochlea, i. e.\r\nlimaçon, or white snail, as an exquisite delicacy.\r\n\r\nSimeon Seth’s account is entirely borrowed from Galen.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of Apicius for dressing the locusta and carabus contain\r\npepper, cumin, rue, mint, vinegar, wine, and oil.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the following lines of Juvenal that British oysters were\r\ngreatly esteemed by the Roman gourmands:\r\n\r\n                    “Circæis nata forent, an\r\n    Lucrinum ad saxum, Rutupinove edita fundo\r\n    Ostrea callebat primo deprendere morsu.”\r\n\r\n                                     (Sat. iv.)\r\n\r\nRochester is supposed to be the ancient Rutupinum. Seneca represents them\r\nas whetters and not food. “Ostrea non cibi, sed oblectamenta sunt, ad\r\nedendum saturos cogentia.” The poet Matron, as quoted by Athenæus, calls\r\nthem “the truffles of the sea.” Athenæus says that oysters caught in the\r\nsea adjacent to a lake or river are the best. Xenocrates remarks that sea\r\noysters are small and saltish.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the ancients often used the sea tortoise or\r\nturtle fish as an article of food, and yet it is clear from Athenæus\r\n(viii, 17), that it was sometimes eaten. See Schweigh. (l. c.) Zenobius\r\nsays that the flesh of the tortoise, if eaten in small quantities, is apt\r\nto produce tormina, and that if eaten largely, it purges. (Cent. iv, 32.)\r\nSee also Actuarius (iv.) It is to be kept in view that the Mediterranean\r\nturtle is generally unwholesome, and the ancients in general could have\r\nlittle acquaintance with any other species. Ælian, however, makes mention\r\nof the Indian turtle. (N. A. xvi, 14.) See further Gesner (de Aquat.\r\n1141.) The chelonopliagi, or turtle-eaters, are noticed by Strabo (xvi);\r\nSolinus (xvii); and Pliny (Hist. Nat. vii, 28.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XCII.—ON THE MOLLUSCA.\r\n\r\nThe mollusca, such as polypi, sepiæ, and loligines, are hard and\r\nindigestible, and particularly the polypi. Their juices are saltish, but\r\nwhen digested they furnish considerable nourishment to the body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen remarks that the mollusca, or mollia, have no scales,\r\nnor any rough testaceous skin, but a soft one, like that of men. Their\r\nflesh, he says, is hard, indigestible, and contains a small proportion\r\nof saltish juices; but, if digested, it affords no little nourishment\r\nto the body. The sepia, or cuttle-fish, was anciently, and is at\r\npresent, much used in Rome as an article of food. Pliny states that it\r\nis laxative. He adds that it is taken in food, boiled with oil, salt,\r\nand barley-meal. Simeon Seth says of it, that it is difficult to digest,\r\nbut that, if digested, it affords considerable nourishment to the body,\r\nand engenders crude humours; on which account, it ought to be taken with\r\nacrid condiments, and an old thin wine drunk afterwards. Mnesitheus, as\r\nquoted by Athenæus, says that the flesh of the mollusca is indigestible\r\nand aphrodisiacal.\r\n\r\nApicius directs us to dress them in much the same way as recommended\r\nby Seth; that is to say, he recommends us to add to them spices, hot\r\naromatics, wine, vinegar, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe sepia of the ancients was indisputably the _sepia officinalis_ L. or\r\ncuttle-fish; the loligo probably the _loligo parva_ of Rondelet, _Angl._\r\ncalamary. The term polypus is vaguely applied, and may comprehend several\r\nspecies of _hydra_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XCIII.—ON THE CARTILAGINOUS FISHES.\r\n\r\nOf the cartilaginous fishes, the torpedo and pastinaca have soft and\r\nsweet flesh, which passes readily downwards, is easily digested, and\r\nproves nutritive. The flairs (_raiæ_), skates (_leviraiæ_), monk fish\r\n(_squatina_), and the like, are harder and difficult to digest, and more\r\nnutritious. In general, those animals which have hard flesh are difficult\r\nto digest, and contain much nourishment. When properly digested, they\r\nfurnish much and substantial nourishment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. For an account of the σελάχη, or cartilaginea, see Aristotle\r\n(H. A. v); Pliny (H. N. ix, 40); Oppian (Halieut, i); Ælian (N. A. xi,\r\n37.)\r\n\r\nGalen says that they are called σελάχη from σέλας ἔχειν, because their\r\nflesh had a shining appearance at night. He states that they are\r\nmoderately nutritious. He remarks, that the parts about the tail of such\r\nfishes are more fleshy than the middle.\r\n\r\nAccording to Athenæus, the cartilaginous fishes in general are flatulent,\r\nfleshy, of difficult digestion, and, if eaten in great quantity, blunt\r\nthe sight. (Deipnos. viii.)\r\n\r\nDr. Coray says that the French call the Ῥίνη ange or angelot, the Βάτος\r\nraie bouclée or cavellade, the Λειόβατος raie miralet, the Νάρκη torpille\r\nor raie torpille, and the Τρυγὼν pastinaque. Harduin gives them nearly\r\nthe same French names. We are inclined to refer the ῥίνη to the _squalus\r\nsquatina_ L. monk or angel-fish: the βατὶς and λειόβατὶς to the _raia\r\nbatis_ and _raia varia_, two species of skate; the νάρκη to the _raia\r\ntorpedo_ or cramp-fish; and the τρυγὼν to the _raia pastinaca_ L. or\r\nfire-flair.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XCIV.—ON THE CETACEA, OR LARGE FISHES.\r\n\r\nThe cetacea, such as the whales, seals, balance-fish, dolphin, and great\r\ntunnies, have hard and indigestible flesh, containing thick juices. When\r\npickled, they are more moderately so. And of the other fishes, those\r\nwhich are most humid and excrementitious are most fitted for pickling;\r\nbut there is the same difference in pickles as in the fishes from which\r\nthey are formed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Under the class cetacea (κῆτος), the ancient naturalists\r\nranked all the large fishes, such as the whale, the dolphin, the shark,\r\n&c. Aristotle was aware that the class called _plagiuri_ by Artedi,\r\ncomprehending the whale, the dolphin, &c. are viviparous, and have lungs\r\nlike quadrupeds, instead of gills like fishes. The balæna of the Greeks\r\nwas a species of physeter, or cachelot.\r\n\r\nGalen states that the flesh of all the cetacea in its recent state is\r\nexcrementitious, but when pickled becomes more attenuate, and easier\r\nconverted into blood. He gives them, in short, the same characters as our\r\nauthor does.\r\n\r\nFor a full account of the pickled fishes of the ancients, we refer to\r\nthe Fragment of Xenocrates, and the third book of Athenæus. We shall\r\ngive the general character of them as delivered by the latter, upon the\r\nauthority of the Siphnian Diphilus. He says that the pickles prepared\r\nfrom sea, lake, and river fishes afford little nourishment, contain few\r\njuices, are of a heating nature, are good for the belly, and whet the\r\nappetite. The old, he adds, are better and more acrid. Of all the pickled\r\nfishes, the most celebrated was the one brought from the Pontus, called\r\n_saperda_. According to Athenæus, it was prepared from the umber (_sciæna\r\numbra_ L.) See also Galen (de Alim. Facult. iii, 41.) Hippocrates says\r\nthey are desiccant, attenuant, and for the most part laxative. (De\r\nDiæta.) Diphilus says they are whetters and laxatives; and hence Galen\r\ndirects them to be taken at the commencement of a meal, and particularly\r\nrecommends them for old men. Rhases speaks more unfavorably of them.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper in this place to give some account of the _isitia_,\r\nor _isicia_ of the ancients. With regard to the etymology of the word,\r\nthen, it is derived by Macrobius ab insectione. They consisted of minced\r\nmeat, either flesh or fish, boiled or roasted, and seasoned with pepper,\r\ncumin, lovage, and the like. Apicius gives receipts for preparing several\r\ndishes of this kind, from the loligo, sepia, locusta, and swine’s liver.\r\nThe last mentioned was inclosed in the omentum, or cowl, and must\r\ntherefore have resembled the dish now called a haggis. Lampridius says\r\nthat the emperor Heliogabalus was the first who prepared isicia from\r\nfishes, oysters, lobsters, squillæ, and the like. If this statement be\r\ntrue, the works of Apicius which we possess cannot be genuine. _Isicia_\r\nfrom shell-fish, the sepia, loligo, &c. are very favorably spoken of by\r\nAlexander Trallian (xi.) On the _Isicia_, see further Ludovicus Nonnius\r\n(de Piscium Esu, xxxviii), and Lambecius (ad Apic.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XCV.—ON THE PROPERTIES OF WINE.\r\n\r\nHe who has taken the subject of health into consideration ought also to\r\nbe acquainted with the powers of wine. Wine in general is nutritious,\r\nbut that which is red and thick is more particularly so; but its juices\r\nare not good. The sweet also is nutritious, but not stomachic. The\r\nastringent is stomachic, but is distributed with difficulty to the parts\r\nof the body, and nourishes less. The white nourishes less still. Wine of\r\na yellow colour is the best of all. That which is old is more heating\r\nand desiccant than the new. Such, in the main, are the properties of\r\nwine. But wine in general resuscitates the natural heat within us, and\r\ntherefore it improves digestion, and forms good blood. And being of a\r\npenetrating nature, it diffuses the nourishment all over the body, and\r\ntherefore it recruits those who are emaciated by disease, for it gives\r\nthem an appetite for food. It attenuates phlegm, clears away the bile\r\nby urine, and imparts a good colour. To the soul also it communicates\r\ngladness and pleasure, and improves the strength. Such are the good\r\neffects of the moderate use of wine. But its immoderate use produces\r\njust the reverse; wherefore, those who are drunk become changed, are\r\ndelirious, and disposed to heavy sleep. On that account, such an\r\nimmoderate use of wine ought to be avoided; but at greater intervals\r\nit may be drank liberally, for it promotes the discharges by urine\r\nand perspiration. But it is better in such cases to vomit, by taking,\r\nbeforehand, of honied water, so that one may not be injured by it.\r\nWhen one has drunk largely, it is not proper to take much of any other\r\nfood; but while drinking, one should eat boiled cabbage, and taste some\r\nsweetmeat, particularly almonds. These things relieve headach, and are\r\nnot difficult to vomit. It is also very proper to take the infusion of\r\nwormwood before drinking, for of all things it is the best preservative\r\nfrom surfeit. If one experience any painful effects from wine, one should\r\ndrink cold water, and the next day again the infusion of wormwood; and by\r\nusing exercise, friction, the bath, and restricted food, in this way get\r\nrestored to health.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The opinions of the ancients on this interesting subject may\r\nbe best learned by consulting Hippocrates (de Diæta, ii, 22, et alibi);\r\nCelsus (ii); Pliny (H. N. xiv and xxxiii, 22, 26); Dioscorides (v); Galen\r\n(de Sanit. tuend. v, 5, and de Alim. Facult. iii); Oribasius (Med. Col.\r\nv, and Euporist. i, 12); Aëtius (i); Athenæus (Deipnos. i); Macrobius\r\n(Saturnal.); Actuarius (de Diæta, 8); Simeon Seth (de Alimentis);\r\nSerapion (de Simplicibus, &c.); Haly Abbas (Theor. 30, and Pract. i, 8);\r\nAvicenna (i, 3, 2); Rhases (ad Mansor. iii, 5, and Continen. xxxvii);\r\nAlsaharavius (Theor. xiii, 2.) Stobæus gives an interesting collection of\r\nthe opinions of the philosophers and poets. (Sermo xviii.)\r\n\r\nFor an ample account of the ancient and modern wines, the reader is\r\nparticularly referred to the late ingenious and classical publication of\r\nDr. Henderson. See also Barry (on Ancient Wines), and Canonherius (de\r\nAdmirandis Vini Virtutibus.)\r\n\r\nFrom the works of Moses and Homer, we learn that the art of converting\r\nthe innocent juice of the grape into wine must have been a very early\r\ninvention. Eustathius informs us that, in very ancient times, the\r\nwines were all of a dark colour; and hence Homer applies to the sea\r\nthe epithet of _wine-coloured_, ὄινοπα πόντον. (Comment, in Iliad. I.)\r\nAchilles Tatius makes the same remark regarding the ancient wine, (ii,\r\n67, ed. Salmasius.) However, in the time of Hippocrates, they had wines\r\nof all colours, as well as characters. He thus describes their general\r\nproperties: Black and austere wines are of a drying nature, and are not\r\nlaxative, nor diuretic, nor sialogogue. It is their heat that renders\r\nthem desiccative, by consuming the humidity of the body. The soft dark\r\nwines are of a more moistening nature, and are more flatulent and\r\nlaxative. The sweet dark wines are of a more moistening nature, but they\r\nare heating and flatulent by imparting humidity. The white austere wines\r\nare heating, but are rather diuretic than laxative. The new are more\r\nlaxative than the old, as being a nearer approach to the fresh juice of\r\nthe grape, and they are nutritious; and the fragrant wines than those of\r\nthe same age which have no _bouquet_, because they are better concocted;\r\nand the thick than the thin. But thin sweet wines are more diuretic,\r\nlaxative, and moistening, and form weak blood.\r\n\r\nCelsus ranks the “vinum dulce vel lene” among the “res boni succi.” Sharp\r\naustere wine he places among the things which are most suitable for the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nDioscorides delivers very judiciously the different characters of wines.\r\nHe concludes with remarking that, although habitual intoxication be\r\nprejudicial to the health, a moderate indulgence in wine for some days,\r\nespecially after drinking water, is beneficial, by proving an alterative\r\nto the system, purging the secretions, and promoting the insensible\r\nperspiration.\r\n\r\nFrom Pliny’s excellent statement of the medicinal and dietetical\r\nproperties of wine, we select the following remarks: “Vino aluntur\r\nvires, sanguis, colorque hominum. Vino modico nervi juvantur, copiosiore\r\nlæduntur, sic et oculi. Stomachus recreatur; appetentia ciborum\r\ninvitatur; tristitia et cura hebetatur; urina et algor expellitur; somnus\r\nconciliatur. Præterea vomitiones sistit. Vetus coposiore aqua miscetur,\r\nmagisque urinam expellit; minus siti resistit. Dulce minus inebriat sed\r\nstomacho innatat; austerum facilius concoquitur. Stomacho minus utile est\r\npingue, nigrum, sed corpora magis alit. Tenue et austerum minus alit,\r\nmagis stomachum nutrit.”\r\n\r\nThe information supplied by Galen on this subject is most ample, but\r\nin too diffuse a shape to suit our narrow limits. Upon the whole, he\r\nstates, thin wines are diuretic, but supply little nourishment, whereas\r\nthe thick are proportionally nutritious. He says that the Falernian,\r\nespecially the sweeter kind, is one of the most wholesome wines. Athenæus\r\ngives an interesting account of the Falernian, upon the authority of\r\nGalen. He says it is fit to be drank after it is ten years old, and\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty; but that, when older, it occasions headach and\r\naffects the nerves. He describes two kinds of it, the sweet and the\r\naustere. The latter, he adds, is of a tawny colour, that is to say, a\r\ncolour intermediate between the white and black. Dr. Henderson concludes,\r\nthat the modern Madeira is a near approach to the ancient Falernian.\r\nBrasavolus and C. Avantius compare it to a wine known in modern Rome\r\nby the name of _greco di soma_. Galen gives very minute directions for\r\nforcing this wine, or giving it premature age by heat. (De Antid. i,\r\nand de Simpl. iv.) Vitruvius, for this purpose, gives directions for\r\nbuilding the wine-cellar close to the kitchen. (vi.) Athenæus says,\r\nthat wine digests the food, and, being of a subtle nature, promotes the\r\ndistribution of it. We learn from him that the ancients sometimes used\r\ntheir wines cooled with ice. (Deipnos. iii, 99.) He thus describes the\r\ndifferent characters of the wines used in his time; that is to say,\r\nabout the middle of the second century, P. C. Of wines, some are white,\r\nsome tawny, and some dark coloured. The white is in nature the thinnest,\r\ndiuretic, and heating, and being digestible it inflames the head, for\r\nit is a wine that has a tendency upwards. A dark-coloured wine, which\r\nis not of a sweet nature, is very nutritious and astringent. Sweet\r\nwines, whether of a white or tawny colour, are very nutritious; for they\r\nlubricate the passage, and thickening the humours, prove less troublesome\r\nto the head. The nature of sweet wines is to remain for a time in the\r\npræcordia, and to prove expectorant, as Diocles and Praxagoras tell.\r\nMnesitheus the Athenian says dark-coloured wine is very nutritious,\r\nthe white very diuretic and very subtle, and the tawny dry, and of all\r\nwines the one that most promotes the digestion of food. Wines carefully\r\nprepared with salt water are not of an intoxicating nature, they loosen\r\nthe belly, occasion pains of the stomach, and produce flatulence, but\r\npromote digestion. Such are the Myndian and the Halicarnassian. The Coan\r\nis well prepared with salt water; the Rhodian has a less proportion of\r\nit; the Cnidian engenders blood, is nutritious, and laxative, but when\r\ndrunk in large quantities it upsets the stomach; the Lesbian has less\r\nastringency and is more diuretic; the Chian is a most delicious wine, and\r\nespecially the kind called Ariusian; but there are three varieties of\r\nit, the austere, the sweet, and the intermediate.—Of the Italian wines,\r\nthe most delicious are the Alban and the Falernian. The Adrian is a\r\ndiffusible, diaphoretic, and safe wine. (i, 25.) According to Galen, the\r\ncæcuban, so frequently mentioned by Horace, was not any one sort of wine,\r\nbut a general name applied to all generous and old wines. (De Succ. bon.\r\n2.) Old wine was much sought after: Galen says everything is impaired by\r\nage but wine. (De Antidot.) The Falernian was reckoned best from ten to\r\ntwenty: the Surrentine was not thought good until twenty-five. (Athen. i.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Actuarius, the thick wines are most nourishing and form the\r\nthickest blood, but are apt to occasion visceral obstructions; while, on\r\nthe other hand, the thin wines are more stomachic and less nourishing.\r\nThe sweet are the contrary; but the white are less hot than the others;\r\nthe gold-coloured are more hot; and then the red.\r\n\r\nWine, says Simeon Seth, is not only nutritious, but promotes in a\r\ngreat degree the distribution of the food over the body, rousing, and\r\nat the same time increasing the vital heat, and with it the urinary and\r\nother secretions. It suits best, he says, with persons of a cold and\r\ndry temperament; and, therefore, it is most proper for old men. He adds\r\nthat the immoderate use of wine dissolves the vital tone, depresses\r\nthe natural heat, and occasions apoplexy, epilepsy, and tumours of the\r\nbody. Macrobius attempts to trace a resemblance between the effects\r\nof habitual intoxication and those resulting from exposure to extreme\r\ncold. “Quæcunque nimium algentibus, eadem contingunt ebriis. Fiunt enim\r\ntremuli, pallidi, graves; et saltu tumultuantis spiritus artus suos et\r\nmembra quatiuntur. Idem corporis torpor ambobus, eadem linguæ titubatio.\r\nMultis etiam morbus ille quem παράλυσιν Græci vocant sic nimio vino,\r\net multo algore contingit.” In like manner, a modern writer, Andreas\r\nBaccius, maintains that some wines are of a cold nature.\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas gives nearly the same characters of wine as Seth. His account\r\nof all the wines, natural and artificial, used in his time, is most ample.\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius forbids wine to be taken when the stomach is quite empty,\r\nor after a full meal. When taken seasonably, he says it improves the\r\nappetite, increases the vital heat, nourishes the body, and clears the\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\nAvicenna, with his usual judgment and industry, collects all the\r\ninformation of preceding authors, to which he adds his own opinions. He\r\nremarks that the immoderate use of wine induces disease of the liver and\r\nbrain, and debilitates the nerves.\r\n\r\nWine, says Rhases, warms the stomach and liver, and dispels flatulence,\r\npromotes digestion, provokes the urinary and alvine discharges, and\r\ngladdens the mind.\r\n\r\nSerapion copies mostly from Galen in delivering the general characters of\r\nwine. He disapproves of wine made with salt water. For an account of it,\r\nsee Pliny and Athenæus, (l. c.)\r\n\r\nThe ancients were scarcely more agreed respecting the intoxicating\r\nproperties of wine than they were as to the powers of the cabbage in\r\ncounteracting them. Old Cato the Censor, who was in the practice “of\r\nwarming his virtue with wine,” describes the following method of cooling\r\nit: “Si voles in convivio multum bibere cænareque, ante cæenam esto\r\ncrudam brassicam quantum voles ex aceto, et item ubi cænaveris comesto\r\naliqua V. folia, reddent te quasi nihil ederis, biberisque, bibesque\r\nquantum voles.” (De R. R. 156.) See a long dissertation on this property\r\nof the cabbage in Athenæus (Deipnos. i, _ad finem_); also Pliny (Hist.\r\nNat. xx, 34); Pseudo-Dioscorides (Euporist. i, 24); Nonnius (14); Simeon\r\nSeth (in voce Brassica); Geopon. (xii, 17); Avicenna, Rhases, and\r\nSerapion give the same character of it. Plutarch affirms that almonds\r\nalso are a preservative from intoxication. (Quæst. vi.)\r\n\r\nBefore quitting this subject, we must notice certain peculiar modes of\r\npreparing wine. The _mustum_ was wine newly made, or the fresh juice\r\nof the grape. The _protropum_ was the juice which runs from grapes\r\nwithout pressing. The _mulsum_ was a preparation of wine and honey.\r\nDioscorides recommends two parts of wine to one of honey; but there does\r\nnot appear to have been any fixed proportion. The _sapa_, called by the\r\nGreeks _hepsema_ and _siræum_, according to Pliny, is must boiled to\r\na third; and the _defrutum_ the same reduced to a half. They are now\r\ncalled robs, a term borrowed from the Arabians. The _carenum_, according\r\nto Isidorus, is must reduced to two thirds. The _passum_ was a sweet\r\nwine prepared from grapes which had been much dried in the sun. The\r\n_passum creticum_, which is much praised by Pliny and Athenæus, and is\r\noften mentioned by our author, the learned Andreas Baccius and Nonnius\r\nbelieve to have resembled the modern malmsey. We have already mentioned\r\na peculiar species of wine prepared with salt water. The ancients also\r\ngave artificial qualities to wine by adding rosin, pitch, and other\r\nsubstances to the casks in which it was deposited. See ‘Geoponica’ (vii.)\r\nDioscorides gives receipts for preparing a great variety of vinous\r\ntinctures. These were used only for medicinal purposes. (Mat. Med. v.)\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary for us to remark that the ancients generally\r\ndrank their wines diluted either with hot or cold water. Hence the poet\r\nJuvenal says: “Quando vocatus adest calidæ gelidæque minister.” (Sat. v,\r\n63.) According to Pliny, Staphylus first introduced this practice (H.\r\nN. viii, 56); but Athenæus refers it to Melampus (ii.) It would appear,\r\nhowever, from some passages in the ‘Ecclesiazusæ’ of Aristophanes,\r\nand from Eustathius’s Commentary on Homer (Iliad, ix, 203), that the\r\nancients often drank their wines undiluted. It was customary, during the\r\ntime of dinner, to drink off a cup of pure wine to “the good deity.”\r\nSee Athenæus (xv, 17), with the learned note of Schweighäuser. The\r\nwine and water were commonly mixed together according to certain fixed\r\nproportions, such as one part of wine and two of water, or two of wine\r\nand three of water, or equal parts of both. (Eustathius in Odyss. vii.)\r\nIn winter it was the rule to drink equal parts of wine and hot water;\r\nbut in summer two parts of water were added to one of wine. (Anonymus de\r\nDiæta ap. Phys. et Med. Min. ed. Ideler, p. 197.) It would appear that it\r\nwas a common practice to drink wine with other hot things in the morning\r\nduring the cold months of winter. (Hierophilus de Nutr. Meth. ed. Ideler.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XCVI.—ON HONEY AND HYDROMEL OR HONIED WATER.\r\n\r\nBoiled honey is rather nutritious than laxative; but when unboiled the\r\ncontrary. It agrees with cold and humid temperaments, but in the warm\r\nit is converted into bile. Honied water does not agree well with those\r\nwho are affected with bitter bile, being converted into bile. In such\r\nconstitutions the honied water ought to be very weak; but it is not\r\nproper for those whose bowels are easily affected. The honied water may\r\nbe prepared by adding eight parts of water to the honey, and thus boiling\r\nit until it cease from frothing. It is expedient also to clear away the\r\nscum as soon as formed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Honey, says Hippocrates, when eaten with other food, is\r\nnutritious, and improves the colour; but, when taken alone, it rather\r\nattenuates than recruits. Actuarius says that scummed honey, when taken\r\nwith other food, is nutritious and laxative. Democritus said, that health\r\nwas best promoted by lubricating the inside with honey, and the outside\r\nwith oil. Honey and bread formed the favorite food of the Pythagoreans.\r\nAthenæus (Deipnos. ii, 7.) See also Oribasius (Synops. iv, 38); Haly\r\nAbbas (v, 27); Simeon Seth (in voce Mel.)\r\n\r\nGalen gives the following account of the phenomenon of a _honey shower_:\r\n“I have sometimes known in the season of summer a great quantity of\r\nhoney to be found upon the leaves of trees, shrubs, and certain herbs,\r\nso that the country people said, jesting, ‘Jupiter has rained honey.’ A\r\ncold night, as for summer, had preceded (for it happened in summer); but\r\nthe temperature of the former day had been hot and dry. It was thought,\r\ntherefore, by those who were skilled in nature, that an exhalation from\r\nthe earth and waters, finely attenuated and concocted by the heat of\r\nthe sun, had been condensed and collected by the cold of the succeeding\r\nnight. This phenomenon occurs rarely with us; but it takes place\r\nfrequently in Mount Lebanon every summer.” (De Alim. Facult.) See also\r\nFragmentum Theophrasti (de Melle, ed. Heinsius.) Ernestus Faber states\r\nthat the honey here described is the manna of cedars. (De Manna Ebræorum,\r\n12.)\r\n\r\nA wine prepared from honey and aromatics is much commended by an\r\nintelligent writer on dietetics as possessing more heat and dryness\r\nthan any other species of wine, and improving the appetite and colour.\r\n(Anonym. Tract. de Cibis ap. Ermerins Anecdota Græca, p. 237.)\r\n\r\nOur author has given one method of preparing the hydromel, or honied\r\nwater. Different modes are described by other authors. Thus, Mesue\r\nrecommends seven parts of water to one of honey. It appears from\r\nHippocrates, however, that it was taken more or less diluted. Pliny and\r\nDioscorides make mention of hydromel prepared by mixing two parts of\r\nwater with one of honey. This seems to have been the strongest hydromel.\r\nA species of hydromel carefully prepared, and kept for a considerable\r\ntime, was esteemed a delicious beverage. Ludovicus Nonnius compares it to\r\nthe mead used by certain nations of the north. They prepare it with hops\r\nand yeast, so that it is made to emulate the nature of wine. The Greeks\r\nand Romans did not make use either of hops or yeast.\r\n\r\nIn imitation of Galen, who, under the head of honey (de Simpl.), treats\r\nalso of _sugar_, we shall give a brief account of the latter in this\r\nplace. The _saccharum_, then, which is mentioned by Theophrastus (Frag.\r\nl. c.), Dioscorides (ii, 104), Galen (l. c.), Strabo (Geogr. xv), Pliny\r\n(H. N. xii, 17), and other ancient authors, was a natural concretion\r\nforming on various reeds, but more especially upon the bamboo cane\r\n(_bambusa arundinacea_.) The bamboo is noticed by Herodotus (Hist. iii,\r\n98), and by Ctesias (Photii Lex.) Moses Chorenensis, a writer of the\r\nfifth century (Geogr. Armen.), is the first who makes mention of sugar\r\nprocured from the cane by boiling.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XCVII.—ON SLEEP.\r\n\r\nIt remains, after having treated of everything connected with diet,\r\nto say something of sleep, which is generally taken after every other\r\nthing. Sleep, then, may be briefly defined to be a relaxation of the\r\nvital powers, occasioned by a suitable moisture irrigating the brain.\r\nWhen properly taken it may produce many good effects. It digests the\r\nfood, concocts the humours, soothes pain, alleviates lassitude, and\r\nrelaxes that which is contracted. It is also calculated to produce\r\noblivion of mental sufferings, and to rectify the distracted powers of\r\nreason. The most suitable season for sleep is after a meal. But that\r\nduring the day does not agree with all, because the time spent in sleep\r\nis not sufficient for the complete digestion of the food; and, when the\r\ndigestion is interrupted unseasonably, those who rise from sleep at noon\r\nare often troubled with acidity and flatulence, and sometimes even with\r\na gurgling noise in their bowels, unless from habit or sufficient rest\r\nthese bad effects be obviated. The best season for sleep is the night,\r\nfor the humidity and drowsy stillness of night contribute to perfect\r\ndigestion. Wherefore after these nocturnal slumbers we feel the most\r\ndesire for evacuation. The proper limit to sleep should be the complete\r\ndigestion of the food, as may be ascertained by the eructations, and by\r\ntapping over the stomach; after which it may be not unuseful to awake in\r\norder to evacuate the excrementitious remains of the digestion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The philosophy of sleep is ingeniously treated of by\r\nHippocrates (de Insomniis), and by Aristotle (in his treatise de Somno\r\net Vigilia.) Aristotle states that digestion goes on best during sleep.\r\nPliny’s definition of sleep seems to be taken from Hippocrates: “Est\r\nautem somnus nihil aliud quam animi in medium sese recessus.” (H. N.\r\nx, 97.) Alexander Aphrodisiensis, in like manner, says, “Know that,\r\nduring the day, the natural principle is less occupied with its own\r\npeculiar operations, I mean the digestion of the food, the changes of\r\nthe chyle, sanguification, distribution, assimilation, and the like,\r\nthe mind being engaged in its other energies, namely, the five senses,\r\nfantasy, reasoning, and memory; but during night, on the other hand,\r\nnature operates more, and the mind less.” (Problem i, 118.) See also\r\nparticularly Oribasius (Med. Coll. vi, 4); Actuarius (de Diæta, 11);\r\nAvicenna (i, 3, 3); Rhases (ad Mansor. iv, 3); Haly Abbas (Theor. v,\r\n35); Alsaharavius (Theor. xi, 3); Averrhoes (Collect. i, 21.) Averrhoes\r\ndefines sleep to be the recession of the sensorial powers from their\r\norgans to the internal parts; and hence, he remarks, those who sleep\r\nwith their eyes open do not perceive the objects nearest to them. The\r\nvital heat being then collected internally, he adds, the powers of the\r\ndigestive faculty are increased. Rhases agrees with Galen that moderate\r\nsleep forms good blood; but that too much corrupts the juices, that is to\r\nsay, impairs digestion. Haly Abbas remarks that, during sleep, the animal\r\npowers are suspended, while the vital and natural continue unaffected;\r\nand, therefore, the mind or principle of life being then disengaged, as\r\nit were, from one of its offices, is the abler to perform the others\r\naright. Hence, he adds, digestion is best performed during sleep.\r\nAlsaharavius approves of taking rest after a meal, but recommends an hour\r\nto elapse before going to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find in Stentzel’s little treatise, entitled ‘Διατριβὴ\r\nπερι τοῦ ὕπνου,’ an interesting exposition of the opinions of the ancient\r\nphilosophers and physicians on this subject. There is an ingenious\r\ndisquisition on the nature of sleep in the commentary of Stephanus on\r\nthe Prognostics of Hippocrates. In reference to Aristotle’s division of\r\ncauses, he decides that the efficient cause of sleep is the rest of the\r\nparticular senses, and of the general sensorium: the material, a humidity\r\nwhich is carried to the roots of the nerves, and prevents the exit of the\r\nvital spirit; the formal or organic, the brain, in which the humidity is\r\ncollected; and the final, or end which sleep serves, the recreation of\r\nthe powers. (Dietz, T. i, 142.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XCVIII.—ON WATCHFULNESS.\r\n\r\nThe cure of watchfulness in disease, whether proceeding from pain, fever,\r\nor some acute symptom, will be treated of under the head of Fevers. But\r\nwe shall now treat of the watchfulness of those in health. If their\r\nwatchfulness proceed from sorrow, care, or any mental emotions, we must\r\nendeavour if possible to remove the offending cause, and then to divert\r\nthe attention by agreeable sounds. For this purpose, some seek after the\r\ngentle noise of waters, by which they are soothed and lulled to rest.\r\nAfter proper digestion, they should use baths, especially in the evening,\r\nand a moistening diet, such as lettuces and the like. They may also mix\r\nthe green leaves of the black poppy with condiments, and eat fish of easy\r\ndigestion. They should also use plenty of wine which is light and not\r\nold. When about to go to bed, their heads should be anointed with rose\r\noil, or with oil in which the heads of poppies or mandrake have been\r\nboiled. And the oil of dill not too old is soporific. I have known rest\r\nsucceeding suddenly to fatigue produce this effect. Moderate coition\r\nwill sometimes do the same. Others easily procure rest by having their\r\nhead and feet cooled. But if their watchfulness be occasioned by their\r\nstomachs being oppressed by the quantity or bad quality of the food (and\r\nI have known this happen, in like manner as in others it arises from an\r\nunseasonable abstinence or diminution of their accustomed food), this\r\nought to be inquired into and the cause removed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have mentioned, in the 74th Section, that Galen cured\r\nhimself of watchfulness by eating freely of lettuces. See further\r\nOribasius (Med. Collect, vi); Averrhoes (Collectan. ii, 5); Alsaharavius\r\n(Theor. xi, 3); Rhases (Contin. xxxi, Aphorism, iii.) Indigestion, as\r\nregards both food and drink, is stated by Hippocrates as one of the\r\ncommon effects of protracted insomnolency. (De Diæt. in Morb. Acut.\r\n13.) According to Damascius, the commentator on Hippocrates, the causes\r\nof insomnolency are, heat of the brain, an intemperament alone, or the\r\nprevalence of a bilious humour. (Ed. Dietz. T. ii, 298.)\r\n\r\nRhases recommends lettuces, the tepid bath, the affusion of tepid water\r\non the head, and diluted wine. He also recommends mandragora and opium,\r\nwhich, he says, Galen states will produce soporific effects, not only\r\nwhen taken internally, but when rubbed on the forehead, and applied to\r\nthe nostrils. He particularly approves of the following liniment: Pound\r\nthe bark of mandragora, the seed of black henbane, and opium, with the\r\njuice of lettuce, and rub into the temples. He further mentions, that\r\nhaving fallen into a state of insomnolency from too much application to\r\nstudy, he cured himself by eating lettuces and using the oil of the water\r\nlily externally.

XCIX.—ON SOMNOLENCY.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the sleep be profound and heavy, we must abstain\r\nfrom frequent baths and cooling unguents; we must use masticatories, and\r\nupon the whole change the regimen for one of a hotter, drier, and less\r\nnutritive character, because the affection is occasioned by a cold and\r\nhumid matter irrigating the brain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See the Commentary on the Sections on Lethargy and Carus in\r\nBook Third.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. C.—THE EPISTLE OF DIOCLES ON THE PRESERVATION OF HEALTH.—DIOCLES TO\r\nKING ANTIGONUS.\r\n\r\nSince of all kings you are the most skilled in the arts, and have lived\r\nvery long, and are skilled in all philosophy, and have attained the\r\nhighest rank in mathematics, I, supposing that the science which treats\r\nof all things that relate to health is a branch of philosophy becoming a\r\nking and befitting to you, have written you this account of the origin\r\nof diseases, of the symptoms which precede them, and of the modes by\r\nwhich they may be alleviated. For neither does a storm gather in the\r\nheavens but it is preceded by certain signs which seamen and men of much\r\nskill attend to, nor does any disease attack the human frame without\r\nhaving some precursory symptom. If, then, you will only be persuaded by\r\nwhat we say regarding them, you may attain a correct acquaintance with\r\nthese things. We divide the human body into four parts: the head, the\r\nchest, the belly, and the bladder.—When a disease is about to fix in\r\nthe head, it is usually announced beforehand by vertigo, pain in the\r\nhead, heaviness in the eyebrows, noise in the ears, and throbbing of\r\nthe temples; the eyes water in the morning, attended with dimness of\r\nsight; the sense of smell is lost, and the gums become swelled. When\r\nany such symptoms occur, the head ought to be purged, not indeed with\r\nany strong medicine, but taking the tops of hyssop and sweet marjoram,\r\npound them and boil them in a pot with half a hemina of must or rob,\r\nrinse the mouth with this in the morning before eating, and evacuate the\r\nhumours by gargling. There is no gentler remedy than this for affections\r\nof the head. Mustard in warm honied water also answers the purpose very\r\nwell. Take a mouthful of this in the morning before eating, gargle and\r\nevacuate the humours. The head also should be warmed by covering it in\r\nsuch a manner as that the phlegm may be readily discharged. Those who\r\nneglect these symptoms are apt to be seized with the following disorders:\r\nInflammations of the eyes, cataracts, pain of the ears as if from a\r\nfracture, strumous affections of the neck, sphacelus of the brain,\r\ncatarrh, quinsy, running ulcers called achores, caries, enlargement of\r\nthe uvula, defluxion of the hairs, ulceration of the head, pain in the\r\nteeth.—When some disease is about to fall upon the chest, it is usually\r\nannounced by some of the following symptoms: There are profuse sweats\r\nover the whole body, and particularly about the chest, the tongue is\r\nrough, expectoration saltish, bitter, or bilious, pains suddenly seizing\r\nthe sides or shoulder-blades, frequent yawning, watchfulness, oppressed\r\nrespiration, thirst after sleep, despondency of mind, coldness of the\r\nbreast and arms, trembling of the hands. These symptoms may be relieved\r\nin the following manner: Procure vomiting after a moderate meal without\r\nmedicine. Vomiting also when the stomach is empty will answer well;\r\nto produce which first swallow some small radishes, cresses, rocket,\r\nmustard, and purslain, and then by drinking warm water procure vomiting.\r\nUpon those who neglect these symptoms the following diseases are apt to\r\nsupervene: Pleurisy, peripneumony, melancholy, acute fevers, frensy,\r\nlethargy, ardent fever attended with hiccough.—When any disease is\r\nabout to attack the bowels, some of the following symptoms announce its\r\napproach: In the first place, the belly is griped and disordered, the\r\nfood and drink seem bitter, heaviness of the knees, inability to bend the\r\nloins, pains over the whole body unexpectedly occurring, numbness of the\r\nlegs, slight fever; when any of these occur, it will be proper to loosen\r\nthe belly by a suitable diet without medicine. There are many articles\r\nof this description which one may use with safety, such as beets boiled\r\nin honied water, boiled garlic, mallows, dock, the herb mercury, honied\r\ncakes; for all these things are laxative of the bowels. Or, if any of\r\nthese symptoms increase, mix bastard saffron with all these decoctions,\r\nfor thereby they will be rendered sweeter and less dangerous. The smooth\r\ncabbage boiled in a large quantity of water is also beneficial; this\r\ndecoction with honey and salt may be drank to the amount of about four\r\nheminæ, or the water of chick-peas or tares boiled may be drank in the\r\nsame manner. Those who neglect the afore-mentioned symptoms are apt to\r\nbe seized with the following affections: Diarrhœa, dysentery, lientery,\r\nileus, ischiatic disease, tertian fever, gout, apoplexy, hemorrhoids,\r\nrheumatism.—When any disease is about to seize the bladder, the following\r\nsymptoms are its usual precursors: A sense of repletion after taking even\r\na small quantity of food, flatulence, eructation, paleness of the whole\r\nbody, deep sleep, urine pale and passed with difficulty, swellings about\r\nthe privy parts. When any of these symptoms appear, their safest cure\r\nwill be by aromatic diuretics. Thus the roots of fennel and parsley may\r\nbe infused in white fragrant wine, and drunk every day when the stomach\r\nis empty in the morning to the amount of two cyathi, with water in which\r\ncarrot, myrtle, or elecampane has been macerated (you may use any of\r\nthese you please, for all are useful); and the infusion of chick-peas in\r\nwater may be drank in like manner. On those who neglect these symptoms\r\nthe following diseases are apt to supervene: Dropsy, enlargement of\r\nthe spleen, pain of the liver, calculus, inflammation of the kidneys,\r\nstrangury, distension of the belly. Regarding all these symptoms it may\r\nbe remarked that children ought to be treated with gentler remedies, and\r\nadults with more active.—I have now to give you an account of the seasons\r\nof the year in which each of these complaints occur, and what things\r\nought to be taken and avoided. I begin with the winter solstice.—_Of the\r\nwinter solstice_: This season disposes men to catarrhs and defluxions,\r\nuntil the vernal equinox. It will be proper then to take such things\r\nas are of a heating nature, drink wine little diluted, or drink pure\r\nwine, or of the decoction of marjoram, and indulge in venery. From the\r\nwinter solstice to the vernal equinox are ninety days.—_Of the vernal\r\nequinox_: This season increases phlegm in men, and the sweetish humours\r\nin the blood until the rising of the pleiades. Use therefore juicy and\r\nacrid things, take labour, and indulge in venery. To the rising of the\r\npleiades are forty-six days.—_Of the rising of the pleiades_: This season\r\nincreases the bitter bile, and bitter humours in men, until the summer\r\nsolstice. Use therefore all sweet things, laxatives of the belly, and\r\nindulge but sparingly in venery. To the summer solstice are forty-five\r\ndays.—_Of the summer solstice_: This season increases the formation of\r\nblack bile in men, until the autumnal equinox. Use therefore cold water,\r\nand everything that is fragrant; and do not indulge in venery, or do so\r\nmore sparingly than is generally directed regarding these matters. To\r\nthe autumnal equinox are ninety-three days.—_Of the autumnal equinox_:\r\nThis season increases phlegm and thin rheums in men until the setting of\r\nthe pleiades. Use therefore remedies for removing rheums, have recourse\r\nto acrid and succulent things, take no vomits, and abstain from labour\r\nand venery. To the setting of the pleiades are forty-five days.—_Of the\r\nsetting of the pleiades_: This season increases phlegm in men until the\r\nwinter solstice. Take therefore all sour things, drink as much as is\r\nagreeable of a weak wine, use fat things, and labour strenuously. To the\r\nwinter solstice are forty-five days.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Diocles was an ancient physician of great eminence.\r\nGalen often mentions him along with his idol, Hippocrates, as the\r\ngreatest of medical authorities. Cælius Aurelianus frequently quotes his\r\nopinions in respectful terms, although belonging to a different sect from\r\nhis own. Pliny says that he was next to Hippocrates in fame as in time.\r\nOctavius Horatianus calls him the younger Hippocrates. Athenæus mentions\r\na work of his on Poisons, and another on Cookery.\r\n\r\nLe Clerc questions the authenticity of this epistle, but seems to have\r\nhad no other grounds for his scepticism than the general suspicion\r\nwhich has attached to all the Epistolæ Græcanicæ since the memorable\r\ncontroversy between the Honorable Mr. Boyle and Dr. Bentley on the\r\nauthenticity of the Epistles of Phalaris. It is published in the\r\n‘Bibliotheca Græca’ of Albertus Fabricius, who appears to have been\r\nsatisfied as to its genuineness. Mr. Moir, the author of ‘Outlines of\r\nthe Ancient History of Medicine,’ condemns it as apocryphal, upon the\r\nauthority of Schulze. (p. 76.) All we shall say on this point is, that\r\nthe evidence against the authority of this Epistle appears to us to be\r\nvery inconclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.—ON FEVERS, FROM THE WORKS OF GALEN AND SEVERAL OTHERS.\r\n\r\nAfter having treated of those things which relate to the preservation of\r\nhealth, we now come to the treatment of persons already in disease, and\r\nshall begin with homogeneous disorders as being the most simple. These\r\nare what are called Fevers. Wherefore, using again principally Oribasius’\r\nEpitome of the Works of Galen and several others on this subject, we\r\nshall add a very few things omitted by them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The following ancient authorities may be consulted on the\r\nsubject of fever: Hippocrates (Epidem. et alibi); Galen (Comment.\r\nin Hippocr. Epidem., de Differentiis Febrium, Meth. Med. viii,\r\nTherap. ad Glauc. i, De Typis, de Crisibus et alibi); Celsus (iii);\r\nPseudo-Dioscorides (Euporist. ii); Oribasius (Synop. vi, Euporist.);\r\nAretæus (Morb. Acut. ii, 4); Aëtius (v); C. Aurelianus (Pass. Acut. ii,\r\n10); Alexander Trallian (xii); Alexander Aphrodisiensis (Probl. i, 84, de\r\nFebribus); Actuarius (Meth. Med. iii); Pliny (Hist. Nat. xxviii, 66, xxx,\r\n30); Palladius (de Febribus); Michael Psellus (Opus Medicum); Synesius\r\n(de Febribus); Leo (ap. Ermerins Anecdota Græca); Stephanus (Comment. in\r\nPrognost. Hippocrat. ed. Dietz); Constantinus Africanus (de Febribus);\r\nSerenus Samonicus; Vindicianus (Epistola ap. Fabricii Bibl. Græc. tom.\r\nxiii); Avicenna (iv, i); Syrasis, Avicennæ Expositor; Haly Abbas (Theor.\r\nviii, Pract. viii); Alsaharavius (Theor. vi, Pract. xxxii); Serapion (tr.\r\nvi); Avenzoar (iii, 7); Averrhoes (Collig. vii); Rhases (ad Mans. x,\r\nContin. xxx.)\r\n\r\nAll the ancient authorities held that a fever consists of a preternatural\r\nincrease of the Innate, or, as it is now called, Animal heat, which\r\nthey considered as the instrument by which the soul performs all the\r\nfunctions of the body. See Alexander Aphrod. (de Feb.) Thus, Palladius\r\ndefines a fever to be “a preternatural heat, which begins in the heart,\r\nand is diffused by the arteries over the whole body, sensibly injuring\r\nthe actions of the body.” Hippocrates, Galen, Aëtius, Alexander Trallian,\r\nPsellus, Leo, and Actuarius give similar definitions. Cælius Aurelianus\r\nsays of Asclepiades: “Febrium ponit signum calorem plurimum.” (Morb.\r\nAcut. i, 14.) Isidorus defines a fever thus: “Febris a fervore dicta est;\r\nest enim abundantia caloris.” (Orig.) Hippocrates, however, the great\r\nopponent of hypothesis in medicine, insists that there is more in a fever\r\nthan a simple excess of pure heat; or, in other words, that the essence\r\nof fever is heat mixed up with noxious qualities. (De Vet. Med. § 17.)\r\nThe celebrated Erasistratus maintained an opinion, lately revived by\r\nClutterbuck and Broussais, that fevers and inflammations are identical.\r\nSee Milligan’s Celsus (p. 13 and 112); and Cælius Aurelianus (de Acut.\r\nMorb. ii, 3.) He further taught that in fevers the blood of the veins is\r\nthrown into the arteries. (Plutarch de Placit. Philos. v, 29.)\r\n\r\nThe Arabians adopt the opinions of Hippocrates, Alexander, and Galen.\r\nThus, for example, Haly Abbas defines fever to be a preternatural heat\r\nproceeding from the heart, and diffused by the arteries over all parts of\r\nthe body. According to him there are three kinds of fevers. The first,\r\nare seated in the spirits, and affect only the heat of the body: these\r\nare called ephemeral fevers. The second, originate in a vitiated state\r\nof the fluids, which impart a preternatural degree of heat to the heart,\r\nwhence it is diffused over all the body. The third arise in the vital\r\norgans and solid parts, from which heat is transmitted to the heart.\r\n(Pract. viii, 2.) See also, in particular, Rhases (Cont. xxx.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.—OF THE PRINCIPAL CONSIDERATIONS TO BE INQUIRED INTO WITH REGARD\r\nTO FEBRILE AFFECTIONS.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be considered is, whether the disease will prove fatal\r\nor not; then, if it is not to prove fatal, whether it will be acute or\r\nchronic (these considerations apply to other great disorders); and,\r\nthird, whether it will come to a crisis all at once (which is peculiar to\r\nfevers), or be resolved gradually.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section, and great part of the contents of this book are\r\ntaken from Galen (Therap. ad Glauc. i,) or from Oribasius (Synops. vi.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.—FROM GALEN, WHAT TO CALL THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE DISEASE.\r\n\r\nAs headach is not the same complaint as fever, so neither are\r\ninsomnolency, loss of appetite, heaviness of the whole body, and a sense\r\nof lassitude; and yet each of these symptoms, although different from\r\nfever, announces its approach. A fever setting in, and more especially\r\nin an acute manner, cannot escape our notice, nor even that of a person\r\nunacquainted with these matters. Or, if we should suppose that it might\r\nescape us, I should wonder if the patient himself could be ignorant of it\r\nfor more than an hour. Wherefore I call that time the commencement of the\r\ndisorder, when those who are beginning clearly to be affected with the\r\nfever betake themselves to bed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The whole of this Section is taken from Galen (de Diebus\r\ncriticis), where the question is fully discussed. Aëtius, like our\r\nauthor, defines the commencement of a fever to be the time when the\r\nstrength of the patient being overcome by the complaint, he is obliged\r\nto take to bed. On this point the Arabians venture to differ from the\r\nGreeks. Thus, Rhases and Avicenna reckon the commencement from the time\r\nwhen the patient first feels a departure from health.\r\n\r\nThe disagreement among the authorities upon this point is to be\r\nregretted, as it tends to obscure the doctrine of the critical days.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IV.—HOW TO KNOW WHETHER THE DISEASE WILL PROVE FATAL OR NOT.\r\n\r\nThese are fatal symptoms: A deathlike countenance, sharp nose, hollow\r\neyes, and the other symptoms described by Hippocrates, when they do\r\nnot proceed from watchfulness, or evacuation, or want of food; also,\r\nintolerance of the light, shedding tears from no external cause, there\r\nbeing no particular affection of the eyes; or the one eye appearing less\r\nthan the other; or the white of the eyes becoming red, or livid, or\r\nblack, or having a muddiness in them; and the white of the eyes appearing\r\nduring sleep, the eyelids not being closed, unless this symptom proceed\r\nfrom a great evacuation, or from habit. Likewise grinding the teeth,\r\na state of delirium, picking at flocks of wool, or bits of chaff, are\r\nnot favorable. Attention should also be paid to the patient’s mode of\r\nlying. To lie on one’s back, as it were, in a relaxed state, and to\r\nsink downwards in bed, are indications of extreme debility. It is still\r\nworse to have a cold respiration at the mouth and nostrils; and a pulse\r\nobscure, dense, and intermitting, and profuse sweatings with syncope are\r\nmost mortal symptoms. If all the symptoms we have mentioned, or even more\r\nappear, or if they be fewer in number but strong, and if they be without\r\nany of the favorable ones, death is inevitable. The breathing free, pulse\r\nnatural, soundness of intellect, being well disposed to take whatever is\r\noffered, the appearance of countenance and mode of reclining like those\r\nof persons in health,—all these symptoms are favorable and prognosticate\r\nrecovery; and, in general, whatever symptom is contrary to the natural\r\nstate indicates an unfavorable, whereas, what is correspondent, indicates\r\na favorable termination. Concerning the prognosis from the urine, alvine\r\ndischarges, and sputa, we will speak soon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The great master of prognostics is Hippocrates, whose system\r\nof medicine was entirely based on the observation of the favorable and\r\nunfavorable symptoms of disease. It would appear that the first advances\r\nin this art were made in the temples of the gods, and especially of\r\nÆsculapius, which the sick were in the practice of resorting to in order\r\nto ascertain the issue of their maladies. See a very ingenious and\r\nlearned disquisition, ‘de Hippocratis Doctrina a Prognostice oriunda,’\r\nby F. Z. Ermerins, M.D. The works of Hippocrates, especially the\r\n‘Prorrhetica and Coacæ,’ contain a rich treasure of observations which\r\ncannot be too much explored by the student of medicine. His prognostics\r\nare founded upon the appearances of the face, eyes, tongue, the voice,\r\nhearing, the state of the hypochondriac region, the abdomen, the general\r\nsystem, sleep, respiration, and the excretions. We can do little more, in\r\nthis place, than express our high sense of the value of the ‘Hippocratic\r\nTreatises on Prognostics,’ and recommend the study of them to all members\r\nof the profession who would wish to learn the true inductive system of\r\ncultivating medicine. We shall give as a specimen of Hippocrates’ and\r\nGalen’s labours, in this department, a few of Galen’s remarks on the\r\ncauses of the symptoms, as described by Hippocrates. It is one of the\r\nprognostics of Hippocrates, that profuse perspiration in acute fevers is\r\nunfavorable; and, in explanation of this, Galen states that a critical\r\nsweat may indeed be favorable; but that such as are profuse and continued\r\nindicate a complete prostration of the vital powers. A fixedness of the\r\neyes is said by Hippocrates to be a fatal symptom; the reason of which,\r\naccording to Galen, is, that it proceeds from paralysis, or insensibility\r\nof the muscles of the eye. Hippocrates mentions it as an unfavorable\r\nsymptom when the patient lies with his mouth open; and Galen attributes\r\nthis symptom to the origin of the nerves, that is to say, the brain,\r\nundergoing pressure. Hippocrates states, that involuntary discharges from\r\nthe bowels are an unfavorable symptom; and Galen justly remarks that they\r\nindicate great insensibility.\r\n\r\nThe Prognostics and Aphorisms of Hippocrates are further illustrated\r\nby the learned and interesting Commentaries of Stephanus Sophista,\r\nTheophilus, and Damascius, which were published a few years ago by\r\nDietz. From the nature of their works, it is impossible to give any\r\nsatisfactory outline of their contents within our narrow limits. We shall\r\nmerely give one specimen of them. It is stated in one of the Aphorisms\r\nof Hippocrates, that dyspnœa and delirium occurring together in fever,\r\nindicate a fatal termination. Upon which Theophilus and Damascius remark,\r\nthat the one symptom implies disease of the heart and the other of the\r\nbrain. (Ed. Dietz. T. H., p. 415.)\r\n\r\nCelsus gives an elegant translation of this part of the works of\r\nHippocrates. The following is his version of the description of the\r\nFacies Hippocratica: “Ad ultima jam ventum esse testantur, nares acutæ,\r\ncollapsa tempora, concavi oculi, frigidæ languidæque aures et imis\r\npartibus leniter versæ, cutis circa frontem dura et intenta, color aut\r\nniger aut perpallidus.” Other unfavorable symptoms are also strikingly\r\nportrayed: “Mali morbi testimonium est vehementer et crebro spirare:\r\na sexto die cepisse inhorrescere; pus expuere; vix excreare; dolorem\r\nhabere continuum; difficulter ferre morbum; jactare brachia et crura;\r\nsine voluntate lachrimare; habere humorem glutinosum dentibus inhærentem;\r\ncutem circa umbilicum et pubem macram, præcordia inflammata, dolentia,\r\ndura, tumida, intenta, magisque si hæc dextra parte, quam sinistra est;\r\npericulosissimum tamen est, si venæ quoque ibi vehementer agituntur.”\r\n\r\nAëtius and Oribasius, like our author, borrow almost every thing from\r\nHippocrates and Galen.\r\n\r\nRhases and Avicenna, particularly the latter, treat of the prognostics\r\nin fever very fully. Avicenna, like Hippocrates, sets down deafness as\r\nan unfavorable symptom. Hippocrates had stated, that jaundice coming\r\non before the seventh day is unfavorable; but Averrhoes affirms, that\r\nall the Indian and Persian physicians reckoned it a favorable symptom.\r\nRhases considers yellowness of the skin an unfavorable symptom, unless\r\nthe fever be of a bilious nature. Alsaharavius says it is an unfavorable\r\ncomplication when it does not prove critical. It is proper to mention\r\nhere that Hippocrates modifies the above prognostic by stating in one of\r\nhis aphorisms, that jaundice coming on on the 7th, 9th, 11th, or 14th day\r\nis favorable. (iv. 64.) Alsaharavius states it as a dangerous symptom,\r\nwhen the patient lies on his back with his legs drawn up. This agrees\r\nwith the prognostic of Celsus “Mors denuntiatur ubi æger supinus cubat,\r\neique genua contracta sunt.” Avicenna and Averrhoes state it as a fatal\r\nsymptom when the patient sinks down in bed and exposes his hands and\r\nfeet. (Averrhoes, Comment. in Cant. Avicennæ.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Rhases it is a bad symptom when the patient has lost his\r\nmodesty, so as to expose freely those parts of the body that should\r\nbe covered. He holds also that it is a bad symptom when the vomitings\r\nresemble verdigris. (Ad Mansor. x, 21.)\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus gives an admirable account of the prognostics in\r\ndiseases. See his work, ‘De Præsagiendâ Morte et Vitâ ægrotantium,’\r\n_passim_. He agrees with the ancients, that deafness is an unfavorable\r\nsymptom, unless it occur at the time of a crisis. Like the ancients,\r\nhe considers the absence of thirst an unfavorable symptom in ardent\r\ndiseases, as indicating that the system is insensible of its wants.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. V.—HOW TO KNOW IF THE DISEASE WILL BE OF LONG DURATION.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the disease may be ascertained from four things: from\r\nthe movement of the disease itself, from the habit of the patient,\r\nfrom the pulse, and from the species of the fever. From the movement\r\nof the disease thus: if the four periods of a particular paroxysm have\r\npassed over quickly and in the least possible time, the disease will\r\nbe an acute one, the furthest bound of which will be the seventh day,\r\nand generally it will come to a crisis on the fourth. If the periods of\r\nthe first paroxysm occupy more time than this, but do not exceed twelve\r\nhours, the disease will still be an acute one, which will terminate\r\nwithin the fourteenth day. If it extend longer, so that the commencement\r\nand augmentation of the paroxysm alone occupy a longer period than a\r\nday or a night, such a disease will prove a long one. If the disease\r\nhave no particular paroxysms, but consist of one continued paroxysm, as\r\nit were, from beginning to end, as in synochous fevers, even in this\r\ncase you may call the disease an acute one. It may be judged of from\r\nthe habit of the patient; for if the face and the rest of the body are\r\nalready considerably wasted, an acute disease is indicated; but if nowise\r\nreduced, a chronic one; for a great collection of offending matter is\r\nindicated, which will require a length of time for its concoction. It\r\nmay be judged of from the pulse: thus, a great, strong, quick, and dense\r\npulse, is indicative of an acute disease, but the contrary of a chronic.\r\nFrom the species of the fever, inasmuch as hot and ardent fevers indicate\r\nan acute, whereas gentler, and, as it were, smothered fevers indicate a\r\nchronic one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Celsus thus states the prognostics of a protracted fever:\r\n“Signa quædam sunt, ex quibus colligere possumus, morbum, etsi non\r\ninteremerit, longius tamen tempus habiturum: ubi frigidus sudor inter\r\nfebres non acutas circa caput tantum, et cervices oritur: aut ubi, febre\r\nnon quiescente, corpus insudat: aut ubi corpus modo frigidum, modo\r\ncalidum est, et color alius ex alio fit: aut ubi, quod inter febres\r\naliqua parte abscessit, ad sanitatem non pervenit: aut ubi æger pro\r\nspatio parum emacrescit: item si urina modo liquida et pura est, modo\r\nhabet quædam subsidentia; si lævia atque alba rubraque sunt, quæ in eâ\r\nsubsidunt; aut si quasdam quasi miculas repræsentet; aut si bullulas\r\nexcitat.”\r\n\r\nGalen has given a full exposition of these symptoms in his Commentary\r\non the Prognostics of Hippocrates, from which Aëtius, Oribasius, and\r\nour author have borrowed largely. Rhases, Avicenna, but most especially\r\nHaly Abbas, treat at great length of this subject. See also Averrhoes\r\n(Commentaries on the Cantica of Avicenna.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VI.—HOW TO KNOW IF THE DISEASE WILL TERMINATE BY A CRISIS, OR BY\r\nRESOLUTION.\r\n\r\nThis may be ascertained from what has been already said, namely, the\r\nspecies of the fever and its duration, and perhaps from the species of\r\nthe fever alone. For hot and ardent fevers are of short duration, and\r\nusually terminate with some critical evacuation; whereas the gentler\r\nkinds prove more chronic, and have a tendency to abscess. From what has\r\nbeen said, it appears that we may prognosticate not only when the disease\r\nwill come to a crisis, but also how it will terminate; for acute diseases\r\ngenerally terminate by critical evacuation, and the chronic by abscess.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. A similar statement is made by Aëtius (v, 22.) See also\r\nAverrhoes (Comment. in Cantica Avicennæ.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VII.—ON CRITICAL DAYS.\r\n\r\nOf the critical days, some terminate the disease frequently, faithfully,\r\nwell, completely, clearly, decidedly; and others contrariwise to these.\r\nBut the 13th has been shown to possess an intermediate character. Some\r\nof these are such as to prove critical if they experience even the most\r\nmoderate impetus of nature, such as the 7th and 14th; whilst most of them\r\nprove critical in violent commotions of the system, but not otherwise.\r\nNeither are the favorable all equally favorable, nor the unfavorable\r\nall equally unfavorable; nor is their favorableness and unfavorableness\r\naccording to any order. Those in the first rank of favorable days may be\r\narranged thus: the best of all are the 7th and 14th, next to them the\r\n9th, and 11th, and 20th; and near to them the 17th and 5th, after these\r\nthe 4th, after it the 3d and 18th. Opposed to them, of the second rank,\r\nare these: the worst, which proves obscurely critical with danger, and\r\nis, as it were, diametrically opposed to the 7th, is the 6th: near to it\r\nare the 8th and 10th, after these the 12th, 16th, and 19th. Intermediate\r\nbetween these is the 13th, being neither so objectionable as those of the\r\nsecond rank, nor so powerful in freeing from diseases as those of the\r\nfirst. The critical days then are thus arranged according to their degree\r\nby Galen. Numerically thus: the favorable are the 3d, 4th, 5th, 7th,\r\n9th, 11th, 14th, 17th, 18th, 20th; the unfavorable, the 6th, 8th, 10th,\r\n12th, 16th, 19th; the intermediate, the 13th. Some of the critical days\r\ngive information concerning the others, and are hence called indicatory\r\nby Hippocrates, because they indicate the crisis that is to happen on\r\nanother critical day. Thus the 4th indicates a crisis on the 7th, by\r\ninducing sweats, perspirations, or some such particular evacuation, or\r\nby displaying certain signs which had not formerly taken place, or some\r\nsymptoms of concoction. Galen says that the 4th is indicatory of the 6th,\r\nalthough it be unfavorable, as the 11th is of the 14th, and the 17th of\r\nthe 20th. Until the 14th day the crises are the most decided, next to\r\nthese until the 20th; from the 20th to the 40th they gradually lose their\r\ndecided character. Of these, the first in degree are the 27th, 34th, and\r\n40th, after which are the 24th and 32d. The other numbers intermediate\r\nbetween the 20th and 40th are indeterminate, and those after the 40th\r\nare not properly critical, as they terminate diseases by concoctions and\r\nabscesses rather than by crises. Hippocrates seems entirely to disregard\r\nall those after the 40th day, yet he enumerates the 60th, 80th, and\r\n100th. After these, he says that some diseases prove critical in seven\r\nmonths, some in seven years, and others, as it would appear, in twice or\r\nthrice seven years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The Father of Medicine who was profoundly skilled in\r\nSemeiology, appears to have attached great importance to the observance\r\nof the critical days. At first, as Galen remarks, he seems to have been\r\nundecided respecting certain days, and, accordingly, he gives a somewhat\r\ndifferent list of them in his ‘Prognostics’ and ‘Aphorisms,’ from what he\r\nhas given in his ‘Epidemics.’ His latter list of critical days differs\r\nlittle or nothing from that of Galen.\r\n\r\nGalen reposes such confidence in the doctrine of critical days, that he\r\naffirms that, by a proper observance of them, the physician may be able\r\nto prognosticate the very hour when a fever will terminate. The following\r\nis his list: The 7th is particularly favorable; next, the 14th; next to\r\nthese, the 9th, 11th, and 20th; then the 17th and 5th; afterwards the\r\n4th, 3d, and 18th. The 6th is very doubtful and unfavorable; the 8th and\r\n10th, like the 6th; the 12th, 16th, and 19th, like the 8th and 10th.\r\nIntermediate between these two lists of favorable and unfavorable days is\r\nthe 13th. He informs us that Diocles and Archigenes held the 21st to be\r\nparticularly favorable, but he agrees with Hippocrates in rejecting it\r\nand adopting the 20th.\r\n\r\nCelsus follows the system of Archigenes. He says, “κρίσιμοι dies erant,\r\ndies tertius, quintus, septimus, nonus, undecimus, quartus-decimus,\r\nunus et vicesimus; ita ut summa potentia septimo, deinde quarto-decimo,\r\ndeinde uni et vicesimo daretur.” But he does not hesitate, afterwards,\r\nto express his distrust in the whole system; for, he adds, “verum in his\r\nquidem antiquos tunc celebres Pythagorici numeri fefellerunt; cum hic\r\nquoque medicus non numerare dies debeat, sed ipsas accessiones intueri.”\r\n\r\nThe Greek writers subsequent to Galen adopt his system, with little or no\r\nalteration. Aëtius arranges the critical days thus: First in order, the\r\n7th and 14th; then the 9th and 11th; next to them the 17th and 5th; then,\r\nthe 4th; and afterwards the 3d and 20th. The 6th is usually bad.\r\n\r\nThe last of the ancient authorities, Actuarius, is very full and\r\nconfident in laying down the received doctrines, with regard to the\r\ncritical days. He follows Galen.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians, with scarce one exception, adopt the Galenic system.\r\nAvicenna, who treats of the critical days very fully, mentions the list\r\nof them given by Hippocrates and Galen, and also that by Archigenes, but\r\ndecides in favour of the former.\r\n\r\nRhases mentions the critical days in the following terms: The 3d is\r\ncritical in very acute fevers; the 4th is indicative of the 7th and\r\n6th; the 5th is favorable; the 6th generally unfavorable; the 7th is a\r\nparticularly favorable or unfavorable crisis; the 8th rarely critical,\r\nbut if it be, unfavorable; the 11th critical and indicative of the 14th;\r\nthe 12th rarely critical, and like the 8th; the 13th rarely critical; the\r\n14th, critical and favorable; the 15th like the 13th; the 16th like the\r\n12th; the 17th like the 9th, and indicative of the 20th; the 18th rarely\r\ncritical, or unfavorable; the 19th rarely critical, or, if so, not bad;\r\nthe 20th next to the 14th, and favorable; the 21st sometimes critical,\r\nbut less frequently so than the 20th; the 24th resembling the 20th; after\r\nthese the 27th, 31st, 37th, and 40th are critical. Averrhoes remarks,\r\nthat great deference is due to Rhases’ opinion upon this subject, since\r\nit was confirmed by experience, in more than ten thousand cases, in an\r\ninfirmary (in infirmaria Relenson). His list is very little different\r\nfrom that of Galen. In his ‘Continens,’ he gives an account of the system\r\nof Archigenes, but prefers that of Hippocrates. (xxxii.)\r\n\r\nAverrhoes states that the medical world was divided between the systems\r\nof Archigenes and Galen, but he inclines to the side of the latter in\r\nthis case, although on most occasions given to dispute his authority.\r\n\r\nAvenzoar, upon the whole, nearly agrees with Rhases, but expresses\r\nhimself undecided with regard to the 20th and 21st days. His authority\r\nmust also be allowed to be of great weight upon this subject, if we\r\nmay believe Averrhoes, that he lived to the age of one hundred and\r\nthirty-five, and practised medicine from his fortieth year.\r\n\r\nTo the first class of critical days, according to Haly Abbas, belong the\r\n7th and 14th; to the second, the 11th and 20th; to the third, the 4th,\r\n17th, and 21st; and to the fourth, the 3d, 5th, 9th, and 18th.\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius gives a similar list to Haly’s. He inclines rather to the\r\n20th than the 21st day.\r\n\r\nGalen, and most of the ancient authorities, believed that the critical\r\ndays are influenced by the moon. Actuarius, in particular, attributes\r\nmuch to the influence of the sun and moon in influencing the course of\r\nfevers.\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus gives a correct summary of the ancient doctrines\r\nrespecting the critical days. (De præs. Vita et Morte ægrot. vi, 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VIII.—THAT CRITICAL SYMPTOMS APPEARING IN THE COMMENCEMENT ARE\r\nUNFAVORABLE.\r\n\r\nThe signs of concoction are never unfavorable, for concoction always take\r\nplace when nature prevails, and therefore the signs of it are always\r\nfavorable. But the critical signs may sometimes appear unfavorably, owing\r\nto the crisis partaking of a double character (as was said with regard to\r\nthe critical days), being sometimes favorable and sometimes unfavorable.\r\nThey ought not therefore to appear at the commencement, nor during the\r\nincrease of the disease, but after its acme, at which time nature is\r\nprevailing over the disease.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The opinion here delivered is derived originally from Galen,\r\nbut is maintained also by Oribasius, and the other authorities. It\r\nrequires no comment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IX.—HOW TO JUDGE BEFOREHAND OF A FUTURE CRISIS.\r\n\r\nIf the paroxysms increase in violence, occur earlier, and become much\r\nstronger; if they invade on the third day; and if symptoms of concoction\r\nappear in the urine, alvine discharges, and sputa, the disease will\r\ncertainly soon come to a crisis. If the attack is slow, and if the\r\nparoxysms occur at the same hour every day, you may expect that the\r\ncrisis will not take place till after a longer time. And those fevers\r\nwhich make their attack with rigors cannot terminate until the rigor\r\nabate; for until that occur it is impossible for the disease to have\r\nattained its acme, and therefore much less is it reasonable to expect\r\nthat it is upon the decline.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is copied from Oribasius. (Synops. vi, 3.) The\r\nsubject is fully treated of by Galen (de Crisibus.) Rhases describes very\r\naccurately the symptoms of an approaching crisis, such as, confusion of\r\nthe understanding, vertigo, headach, inquietude, involuntary flow of\r\ntears, pain of the stomach, &c. He warns the inexperienced not to be\r\nalarmed at the violence of the precursory symptoms. (x, 26.) Avicenna,\r\nAverrhoes, Haly Abbas, and Alsaharavius, though they treat of the subject\r\nvery fully, supply no original views.\r\n\r\nSee an ample account of the ancient opinions in Prosper Alpinus. (De\r\nPræs. Vita et Morte ægrot. vi.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. X.—HOW TO RECOGNIZE A PRESENT CRISIS.\r\n\r\nRestlessness precedes every crisis, and if the crisis be to take place\r\nby day, it will occur by night; or if the crisis be to take place during\r\nthe night, it will occur by day; and then certain symptoms supervene,\r\nsuch as headach not previously occurring, sympathetic pain of the neck,\r\nretraction of the hypochondrium, sudden difficulty of breathing, and\r\nother dangerous symptoms which did not manifest themselves before then\r\ntake place. And if, when these occur, the pulse, instead of sinking,\r\nis increased in magnitude and becomes stronger, and the critical\r\nday approaches, and if it be one of the favorable, you may not only\r\nanticipate a crisis, but also a good one. And be not then alarmed if you\r\nsee the patient become delirious and disturbed, for these are indications\r\nof the humours being carried upwards; in like manner as certain other\r\nsymptoms indicate their being determined downwards, such as pain of the\r\nbelly, gripes about the navel, pain in the loins, borborygmi, and other\r\nsimilar symptoms, when they occur. In addition to these, if the patient\r\nwas accustomed to have a hemorrhoidal discharge, and if the period of it\r\nbe at hand, and in like manner with respect to the menstrual discharge\r\n(if the patient be a woman), it is not unlikely that the crisis may take\r\nplace by such an evacuation. And a critical sweat is recognized by a\r\nprecursory moistness of the skin (especially if occurring upon one of\r\nthe days called indicatory), and by openness of the pores. From these\r\nyou may recognize crises by evacuations upwards; for, in addition to the\r\naforesaid, you ought to examine the face of the patients, and whether\r\nthere be palpitation in any part, or throbbing of the temporal arteries;\r\nor if the cheek, nose, or eye be redder than usual, you ought the rather\r\nto anticipate the coming crisis. But if they shed tears involuntarily,\r\nor fancy that they see sparks of light, and constantly carry their hands\r\nto their nose as if to rub it, then indeed you may see not only an\r\napproaching but a present flow of blood; for when they rub it once or\r\ntwice the blood straightway breaks forth. Pungent pain at the stomach,\r\nand trembling of the under-lip often indicate a crisis by vomiting. These\r\nconsiderations are sufficient, but to them may be joined the age and\r\nconstitution of the patient, as strengthening the anticipation; to which\r\nmay be added, the season of the year and the present constitution. For if\r\nthe patient be a child, or otherwise by nature warm and full of blood,\r\nyou may still more form this anticipation; or if formerly, when in health\r\nor disease, as we remarked before, an evacuation of blood appeared, this\r\ncircumstance alone may be sufficient to make you expect a hemorrhagy. And\r\nif the season of the year be summer, or, if not summer, if the present\r\nstate of the weather be hot, and if the patient had often experienced\r\na crisis at that season by hemorrhage, if the body be plethoric, if\r\nthere is retention of the customary evacuations, all these things ought\r\nto strengthen your expectations. In like manner you ought to judge of\r\nthe other evacuations; or, if none of these symptoms should appear, but\r\nif there be uneasiness occurring on one of the critical days after the\r\n20th; or if, when the disease is at its acme, pains should seize certain\r\njoints, or near the ears, or in other parts; or if not pains, but local\r\nsweats should occur unceasingly in any part of the body, then indeed you\r\nmay expect a crisis to take place by abscess, and in that part where the\r\nsweats, pains, or swelling occurred.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is taken with very slight alterations from Galen\r\n(Therap. ad Glauc. i: see also, de Crisibus, iii, 2.) The critical\r\nevacuations enumerated by Galen are, those by vomiting, by the belly,\r\nby urine, by sweats, by hemorrhage from the nose, by hemorrhoids,\r\nby the menses in women, by abscesses of the parotid glands, and by\r\ndetermination to the knees, feet, or some other parts not vital. He says\r\nthere are three ways in which a fever may terminate favorably, namely,\r\nby an evacuation, by an imperfect crisis without an evacuation, and by\r\nresolution, that is to say, when the febrile symptoms go off gradually.\r\nThere are likewise three unfortunate terminations; for the patient may\r\ndie suddenly with much agitation, or in consequence of a metastasis, or\r\nhe may be slowly wasted by a marasmus.\r\n\r\nAverrhoes enumerates the same kinds of critical evacuation as Galen, and\r\notherwise treats of them very judiciously. (Collig. iv, 39.) Avicenna\r\ngives a long account of all the circumstances attending the crisis, but\r\nhe copies closely from Galen and Hippocrates. (iv, 2, 1.) Haly Abbas,\r\nin like manner, is sensible and correct, but borrows from the Greeks.\r\n(Theor. x, 10.) The account given by Rhases is excellent, but it differs\r\nlittle from our author’s. (Ad Mansor. x, 27.) In his ‘Continens,’\r\nhe gives a full exposition of the Galenic doctrines, with his own\r\nCommentaries. He states, that a crisis may take place in six ways: by\r\nhemorrhage at the nose, by an alvine evacuation, by vomiting, by a\r\ndischarge of urine, by a sweat, or by an aposteme.

XII.—ON THE PULSE, FROM THE WORKS OF GALEN.\r\n\r\nThe pulse is a movement of the heart and arteries, taking place by a\r\ndiastole and systole. Its object is twofold; for, by the diastole, which\r\nis, as it were, an unfolding and expansion of the artery, the cold air\r\nenters, ventilating and resuscitating the animal vigour, and hence the\r\nformation of the vital spirits; and by the systole, which is, as it were,\r\na falling down and contraction of the circumference of the artery towards\r\nthe centre, the evacuation of the fuliginous superfluities is effected.\r\nThe arteries themselves are oblong hollow vessels like the veins, but\r\nconsist of two coats, in order to fit them for the afore-mentioned\r\nmotion, and because they have to contain blood and spirits. They arise\r\nfrom the heart, and are distributed to all parts of the body; and,\r\ntherefore, all the arteries pulsate in a similar manner, and like the\r\nheart, so that from one of them you may judge concerning all the rest.\r\nBut the movement of all cannot be equally well observed; for those\r\nwhich are situated in parts not fleshy may be more conveniently felt,\r\nwhereas those that are in fleshy parts are more indistinct. Nor is any\r\none more conveniently situated for being felt than the one at the wrist.\r\nThe first kind of pulses is in regard to the time of their motion, as\r\nobserved in systole and diastole. Its differences are, the _quick_,\r\n_slow_, and _moderate_; because every body which is moved must be moved\r\nquickly, slowly, or intermediately, as to time; that is quick which\r\nis moved over a great distance in a short time; that is slow which is\r\nmoved over a short distance in a long time; and that is moderate which\r\nis intermediate as to motion. The second kind of pulses is in regard to\r\nthe extent of the diastole. For, since every body has three dimensions,\r\nlength, breadth, and depth, and an artery is a body, it follows, that an\r\nartery must have these dimensions. When, therefore, an animal is in its\r\nnatural state, you will find its arteries dilated moderately every way;\r\nbut when not in its natural state, its dilatation will be deficient, or\r\nexceed according to some one of its dimensions. In calculating this,\r\nyou must remember the natural state of the pulse; and if it is found to\r\nexceed in breadth, you must call it _broad_; if in length, _long_; and\r\nif in depth, _high_ or _deep_. It is clear that the opposites to these,\r\nor those that are deficient, are to be named the _narrow_, the _short_,\r\nand the _low_. And with regard to those which are altered from the\r\nnatural state in all their dimensions, that which is every way diminished\r\nis called _small_, and that which is every way increased, _great_. The\r\nthird kind of pulses is with regard to the tone of the vital strength.\r\nThe varieties are three, the _strong_, the _weak_, and the _moderate_.\r\nThe strong is that which strikes the finger of the physician strongly,\r\nand the weak, feebly and faintly; while the moderate is intermediate\r\nbetween them, and is held by some to be the natural one; for that the\r\npulse is rendered stronger by passion and baths, not being naturally\r\nso. In reply to which, Galen contends that a pulse rendered stronger by\r\nnon-natural causes soon undergoes a change; and that, therefore, a strong\r\npulse, which does not readily change, may be natural and moderate. The\r\nfourth kind is in regard to the consistence of the instrument, I mean\r\nthe body of the artery. In this respect there are three differences; for\r\nthe artery is either harder than natural, and is called a _hard_ pulse;\r\nor softer, and is called a _soft_, or intermediate, and is called in\r\nthis respect _moderate_. The fifth kind is in regard to the contents\r\nof the artery; and their differences are, the _full_, the _empty_, and\r\nthe _moderate_, since every vessel must be full, empty, or moderately\r\nfull of liquids. A full pulse, then, as Archigenes defines it, is one\r\nwhich indicates an artery that is completely full, and the impression of\r\nwhich is, that it is distended with fluids; and an empty one conveys an\r\nimpression as if its contents were full of bubbles of air, so that the\r\nfinger, when pressed upon it, seems to fall into an empty space. These\r\nfive kinds of pulses regard one motion of the artery. And since the\r\nquality of the heat in the heart may be more developed than usual in the\r\nartery, some have hence reckoned a sixth kind of pulses. Of the other\r\nkinds, whether they are in regard to one or more pulsations, they derive\r\ntheir character either from the time of rest, or the rhythm, or their\r\nequality and inequality, or their regularity and irregularity. The kind,\r\nthen, in regard to the time of rest, which is the seventh in order, is\r\ndivided into the _dense_, the _rare_, and the _moderate_. And, since an\r\nartery has a double motion, composed of two opposite movements, it must\r\nof necessity have two seasons of rest: the one after the diastole before\r\nthe systole, the other after the systole before the diastole, which to\r\nmost people appears imperceptible; and, therefore, the interval of rest\r\nbetween two motions has been chosen. When, therefore, there is a long\r\ninterval of rest, the pulse is called _rare_; when short, _dense_; and\r\nwhen intermediate, _moderate_. The eighth kind is in respect to rhythm.\r\nRhythm, then, in general, is the ratio and proportion of one time to\r\nanother. In regard to the pulse, it is, according to some, the ratio of\r\nthe time of motion to the time of rest, as of the systole and diastole,\r\nto the intermediate time of rest; but, according to others, it is the\r\nratio of a time of motion and rest to another time of motion and rest, or\r\nof motion to motion.\r\n\r\nOf rhythm, then, there are two varieties, the rhythmic and the arhythmic.\r\nOf the arhythmic, there is a threefold difference: first, when there is\r\na slight departure from rhythm; second, when there is a greater; and\r\nthird, when there is no rhythm at all. Thus, for example; in a child, if\r\nhis pulse has the rhythm of childhood, it is called its proper rhythm; if\r\nit has that of an adult, it is said to be an improper rhythm; or if it\r\npreserve no ratio at all, it is said to be devoid of rhythm.\r\n\r\nThe ninth kind of pulses is found in all the other kinds already\r\nmentioned; namely, that which regards equality and inequality, which may\r\nbe remarked either in one pulse, or in many, which last is called the\r\nsystematic, of which we must speak first, as being more clear. An _equal_\r\npulse, then, is that which is alike in order, as regards magnitude,\r\nstrength, frequency, and certain other, or indeed all its other,\r\ncharacters. The _unequal_ pulse is that which is unlike in order. For,\r\nif all are alike, as, for example, all deficient in magnitude, such a\r\npulse is called equal. But if the first, second, and third appear alike,\r\nbut the fourth unlike, it is clear that such a pulse is _unequal_ as to\r\nmagnitude. Of this kind are the _intermitting_ and the _intercurrent_.\r\nFor not only after one or more great pulsations may one smaller occur;\r\nbut sometimes this motion is wholly lost, and one pulsation is said to\r\nbe wanting. The other kind, the intercurrent, is the opposite to this;\r\nfor when we are expecting an interval of rest, a supernumerary pulsation,\r\nas it were, occurs. When the second is a little smaller than the first,\r\nand the third than the second, and the fourth than the third in like\r\nmanner, and so onwards, such pulses are called _sharp-tailed_ or _myuri_,\r\nderiving their names from figures terminating in a sharp point. Such as\r\nare altogether diminished, and never cease from this state, terminate\r\nin a total loss of motion, and are called _failing_ or _fainting myuri_.\r\nThere are two varieties in respect to those which fail, for some of them\r\npersevere in that state of smallness in which they terminated, whilst\r\nothers attain again their original magnitude, or less or more, and these\r\nare called _recurrent myuri_. Pulses also are called myuri, from their\r\ninequality in regard to one pulsation, concerning which we will speak\r\npresently. And this is the nature of that inequality of pulse, called\r\nsystematic. But it takes place with regard to one pulse, or one part of\r\nan artery, or more, as perhaps with regard to motion, for the inequality\r\nis observed on one part of the artery, when the motion of the artery upon\r\nthe finger begins one way and terminates another, beginning quicker,\r\nand terminating slower, or reversely. This happens in a threefold\r\nmanner, the motion either remaining constant, or being interrupted, or\r\nrecurring and beating double, as it were. If, then, remaining constant\r\nand uninterrupted, it should change from quickness to slowness, or\r\nconversely, such a pulse is said to be, and is of unequal velocity. But\r\nif, after being interrupted by an interval of rest, it again appear\r\nquicker, it is called the _goat-leap_ or _dorcadissans_, the term being\r\nderived from the animal _dorcas_, which, in jumping aloft, stops in the\r\nair, and then, unexpectedly, takes another and a swifter spring than the\r\nformer. But if after the diastole it recur, and before a complete systole\r\ntake place, strike the finger a second time, such a pulse is called a\r\n_reverberating_ one, or _dicrotos_, from its beating twice. You may see\r\nsuch a thing take place upon a stithy, when a hammer, swung by the hand,\r\nfirst strikes the stithy, and afterwards, recoiling from the reaction of\r\nthe stithy, strikes of itself a second or third time. And not only may an\r\ninequality in the time of motion take place as to one pulsation in one\r\npart of an artery, but also in regard to the strength of the power; not\r\nso, however, in regard to the extent of dilatation (for it is impossible\r\nthat the same pulse in the same place should be great and small at the\r\nsame time), nor in regard to the other kinds of pulses. But in different\r\nplaces different parts of an artery may exhibit a double inequality in\r\none pulsation. For the motion may continue constant, and be swifter at\r\none finger and slower at another; or it may intermit, and one finger may\r\nperceive it, and another not. And also, in regard to the extent of the\r\ndiastole, the same inequality becomes apparent in different places. Of\r\nthis kind are the myuri, diminishing once and again at one pulsation;\r\nfor, if at the inner finger the pulse should be great and swelled up,\r\nbut under the external at the thumb of the patient it appear smaller,\r\nsuch a pulse is called myurus, from its resemblance to the tail of a\r\nmouse; or meiurus, from its being diminished like a tail. But if the\r\npulse appear great, and swelled under the middle finger, but smaller on\r\neach side, Archigenes called this impulse _innuens et circumnuens_, i.e.\r\n_the declining, and the declining on both hands_, wishing to mark the\r\nsmallness of the diastole, with the declination, as it were, of the two\r\nextremities; for these parts do not appear as if they were cut short, but\r\nas if they were bent in, and a little contracted on each side, and hence\r\nthe pulse is curtailed (myurus) on both sides.\r\n\r\nAnd when the inequality as to magnitude takes place at different times,\r\nsuch pulses become _undulatory_ and _vermicular_. And if irregularity of\r\nposition be joined to them, they are called _spasmodic_ and _vibratory_.\r\nLet us begin with the undulatory, in which the whole artery is not\r\ndilated at the same time, according to the same inequality, but this\r\npart of it first, that second, that third, and that fourth, the motion\r\ncontinuing constant like the swelling of the waves. And some have the\r\nwave carried straight forward, some obliquely; some have a sufficient\r\naltitude in a short expansion as to length, and some conversely; some\r\nhave a broad, and some a narrow, and they have the like inequality\r\nin regard to quickness and strength. When the undulatory is wholly\r\ndiminished in size, it is called the vermicular, which resembles the\r\nmotion of a worm. As the undulatory pulse, when it goes on diminishing,\r\nterminates in the vermicular, so in like manner does the vermicular\r\nin the _ant-like_, or _formicans_, when, most of its motions being\r\nlost, it terminates in one, and it a very small motion. It is called\r\n_formicans_ from its resemblance to the ant (_formica_), on account\r\nof its smallness and kind of motion. The _ant-like_ pulse (called\r\nformicans) is very small, there being none smaller than it; and, in\r\nlike manner, it is of all others the most indistinct and dense, but is\r\nnot quick, as Archigenes supposed. Nearly allied to it is the _hectic_.\r\nFor as there is a hectic fever, so is there also a hectic pulse, which\r\nundergoes little or no variation, but remains always alike contracted\r\nas it first began, and never expanding, the whole habit being turned\r\ninto disease. The _spasmodic_ pulses appear as if they were dragged,\r\nstretched, and drawn by the extremities, conveying the sensation of a\r\nstretched cord. But no such thing takes place in the _vibratory_; for\r\nin them the dilatation is greater, as if different parts of the artery\r\nwere carried upwards at one and the same time. They may be resembled to\r\ndarts, which, when thrown with force, are carried along with a vibratory\r\nmotion. The pulse is _serrated_ when part of the artery seems to be\r\ndilated and part not; the artery itself also appearing to be harder than\r\nnatural. This pulse has some of the characters of the vibratory, and is\r\nquick and dense, but not always great. In addition to those mentioned,\r\nthere is a tenth kind of pulses arising from inequality, namely, that\r\nwith regard to regularity and irregularity. The unequal pulses being\r\ndivided into those which are alike as to periods, and those which are\r\nwholly unlike, the regular and irregular are formed according to each of\r\nthese divisions; from the equality of periods the _regular_ is formed,\r\nand from the entire inequality the _irregular_. The equal pulse is also\r\nalways regular (since consequently we call it alike); but the unequal\r\nis not altogether irregular; for, supposing it to have no equality, and\r\nyet to preserve a certain period, such, for example, as to extent of\r\ndiastole, if there are two great and one small, then again two great\r\nand one small, and so on successively, such a pulse would be called\r\nanomalous, that is to say, unequal, but regular. But, if it not only had\r\nno equality, but likewise no order in its inequality, such a pulse would\r\nbe not only unequal, but also irregular, and in like manner with regard\r\nto the other kinds. Of the irregular, some are altogether so, observing\r\nno period whatever; others are indeed regular as to periods, but, having\r\nno continued order, they may in this respect be called irregular, but in\r\nso far they observe a certain period regularly, they being regulated as\r\nto their periods. As if, for example, there were two great and two small,\r\nthen three great and three small, and four great and an equal number\r\nsmall; and, returning again, two great and two small, three great and\r\nas many small, and so on in like manner. It is to be remarked that, of\r\nall the other opposite kinds, there is one intermediate between the two\r\nextremes, but that there is none between the equal and unequal, and the\r\nregular and irregular, unless you choose to call the one which is regular\r\nas to periods the medium between the regular and irregular. And the\r\nintermediate pulses of all the other kinds are the natural, except that\r\nwhich relates to strength and weakness, as we showed. But, in those we\r\nhave been describing, the equal alone is the natural, and all the others\r\nare not natural, namely, the unequal, the regular, and the irregular.\r\nThese are all the kinds of pulses and their generic differences. Some add\r\ntwo others to these, the one in regard to the position of the artery,\r\naccording as it seems to be carried upwards or downwards, to the right\r\nor to the left, and the other in regard to the times of expansion. But\r\nthese we treated of along with the undulatory and vibratory. And we, for\r\nthe sake of brevity, have only delivered the simple varieties; but, from\r\nwhat has been said, one may easily connect them, and discover those which\r\narise from their combinations.\r\n\r\nThe causes affecting the pulses are next to be treated of, with which\r\nis connected the prognosis from them. We shall begin with those which\r\nrespect magnitude, because it is more obvious than the others. A great\r\npulse is produced either by some urgent necessity, such as an excess of\r\nheat in the heart requiring refrigeration, and, as it were, ventilation\r\nfrom without; or it may arise from leanness of the body, as we shall\r\nsoon show. The excess of heat is occasioned either by natural causes,\r\nsuch as the ages of manhood and youth, or simply a hot season, place, or\r\na warmer temperament; or by non-natural causes, such as the air which\r\nsurrounds us being hotter than common, hot baths, exercises, food,\r\nwine, heating medicines; or by preternatural causes, such as a hot\r\nintemperament, putrefaction of the fluids, passion, or the like. You may\r\njudge of these classes of pulse from the following observations. Those\r\nwhich are natural are permanent and not very susceptible of change,\r\nwhilst the others readily change, so that often while you examine them,\r\nor generally after a very short time, they will altogether alter. A\r\npulse also which owes its greatness to a hot bath has softness for\r\nan accompaniment; and hardness is generally combined with greatness\r\nproceeding from a hot intemperament, especially when combined with\r\ndryness of the system. Those who have undergone moderate friction or\r\nexercise have a pulse intermediate between hardness and softness; but\r\nthey have the parts about the chest warmer than natural, which is the\r\ncase also with those in a passion. Those that are influenced by food,\r\nthe use of wine, or rage, have vehemence joined to greatness. Those\r\nwho wish to conceal anger, or something which they have done without\r\npermission of the physician, (such as if a person has taken a heating\r\nmedicine, and wishes to conceal it from the physician, who inquires about\r\nit while he feels the pulse,) in such persons a manifest inequality is\r\njoined to greatness. To the discovery of this state other considerations\r\nmay contribute, such as the habit of the patient, as if he appeared to\r\nbe fond of taking medicines, or his disposition, as if it be bad, and\r\ncunning at concealments. A pulse which is great from putrefaction of the\r\nfluids has a contraction more hasty than natural joined to its greatness.\r\nTo form a great pulse, an urgent necessity is not alone sufficient; but\r\nthe vital powers must also contribute, and a condition of the instrument\r\nor artery intermediate between hardness and softness. When the heat,\r\ntherefore, is increased in the heart by any of the above-mentioned\r\ncauses, in the first place the pulse becomes great, and, the greatness\r\nnot being able to supply the want, quickness is straightway joined\r\nto it; and if that is not sufficient, density is superadded. Small,\r\nslow, and rare pulses are formed by the opposite causes. But when a\r\nchange first takes place from a great, quick, and dense pulse to their\r\nopposites, namely, when the necessity is at an end, the first character\r\nof the pulse is not the first that leaves it, but it loses first that\r\nwhich it last acquired, becoming first rare, then slow and last small.\r\nBut if the slowness and smallness should go on increasing, the rarity\r\nwill again change to density, in order that the necessary want may be\r\nsupplied. Such are the causes of greatness, quickness, density, and\r\ntheir opposite pulses. To these we shall connect the alteration of the\r\npulse in regard to one dimension only. Breadth alone then is increased,\r\nprincipally by a redundancy of humidity, either natural, or from external\r\ncauses, as loftiness is occasioned by the softness of the instrument,\r\nassisted by the vital power; but length is rendered apparent by the\r\ndryness and melting of the surrounding flesh, the other dimensions being\r\ncontracted. For an artery cannot, in fact, become longer than natural;\r\nand this ought more properly to be called _the lean_ pulse, as the\r\nopposite one, namely, that which is increased only in breadth and depth,\r\nshould be called _the fat_. The pulse sometimes falls under the opposite\r\ncharacters to this, when it is restrained as to any of its dimensions,\r\nand appears low, narrow, and short, when it is not so in reality, but\r\nseems so, owing to the thickness of the fat, flesh, or membranes which\r\npress upon it. Sometimes, too, the whole seems small, when it is not so\r\nin reality; and feeble in like manner. And what do I say? Sometimes an\r\nasphyxy, or complete loss of pulsation, hath seemed to take place over\r\nthe whole arteries, when there is no such thing in reality; and this\r\nhas happened, more especially to those who have felt them carelessly,\r\nwhen the motion, being really indistinct, escapes notice, owing to the\r\nquantity of flesh; for it is impossible that a complete asphyxy could\r\ntake place while the man is alive. In like manner again in the emaciated,\r\nsmall pulses appear great. When, therefore, the body is greatly wasted,\r\nthe artery which runs along the spine has often been felt by persons\r\ntouching the abdomen, and also the pulses in members which before used\r\nnot to be felt. Wherefore we must attend to all circumstances, that we\r\nmay not be mistaken in our diagnosis. A strong pulse is occasioned by\r\nthe force of the natural faculty, when not counteracted by any other\r\ncause, such as the want failing, or from hardness of the instrument.\r\nBut a feeble pulse may arise from weakness of the natural powers alone,\r\nalthough no other causes contribute. For a strong pulse stands in need\r\nof all the other causes for its formation; but the feeble is produced\r\nby weakness alone. The originally strong pulse accompanies moderate\r\nages, seasons, places, and temperaments; but the feeble the immoderate.\r\nA pulse changing from feebleness to strength is formed by the vital\r\nfaculty growing strong, from a preceding state of debility. It is\r\nstrengthened either by things within the body, such as concoction of the\r\nfluids, or an excretion of them, or passion; or by externals, such as\r\nwines, food, exercises, and whatever will rectify the intemperament. The\r\nnatural powers are weakened by want of food, watchfulness, immoderate\r\nevacuations, grief, cares, and more especially pains inducing syncope,\r\nand whatever forms an intemperament. Some inexperienced persons have\r\nthought a hard pulse strong, but a person of experienced understanding\r\nand touch will not mistake them; for a strong pulse, being mostly\r\naccompanied with greatness, is swelled up to loftiness and strikes the\r\nfinger forcibly; but the hard does not admit of greatness, on account\r\nof the unyielding state of the artery. Wherefore a pulse becomes hard\r\nowing to the hardness of the artery. This is occasioned by immoderate\r\ncold, or dryness, or tension proceeding from inflammation, or spasm. To\r\nthe hardness, moreover, are joined smallness, quickness, and sometimes\r\ndensity instead of greatness accompanying, owing to the exciting want.\r\nA soft pulse follows a humid state of the artery. An artery is rendered\r\nmore humid by things not preternatural, such as more liquid food,\r\nimmoderate baths, much sleep, a more abundant diet, and hilarity; and\r\nby preternatural causes, such as coma, lethargy, dropsy, and the other\r\npituitous affections. A full pulse indicates an abundance of fluids, or\r\nplethora from food, or from drinking wine, as the empty, on the other\r\nhand, indicates deficiency of food or evacuation. When the body of the\r\nartery feels warmer under the finger, this indicates great heat in the\r\nheart, while the rest of the body is cold, or a certain spasmodic state\r\nof the arteries, which are warmed by the violent motion. Archigenes\r\nsays that the place of the artery will particularly be found warmer in\r\ncatochus and in those who are about to be affected with somnolency.\r\nWith regard to rhythm, when the ratio of the times of motion and rest\r\nis equal, it indicates a proper temperament of the body, or no great\r\ndeparture from it, as in early age, and the otherwise well-regulated\r\nbodies. But when the time of rest is greater than that of motion, this\r\nindicates that heat prevails, as in adults and those of the adjoining\r\nages; as, in aged bodies, which are entirely cold, the time of motion is\r\ngreater than that of rest. It is to be remarked that inequality in regard\r\nto rhythm, being the measure of that as to quickness and density, this\r\nholds the place as it were of the _matériel_ to the rhythm.\r\n\r\nThe intermittent and intercurrent pulses take place when the powers are\r\noppressed, and, as it were, borne down; but the intercurrent indicates\r\na lesser, and the intermittent a greater injury. And, in general, that\r\nstate in which the powers are oppressed and borne down, changes the\r\npulses to inequality and irregularity in every other respect, and also in\r\nregard to strength and greatness. The pulses called myuri, being shown\r\nto be of two kinds, (for they are found either in that inequality called\r\nsystematic, or in regard to one pulsation), the _failing_ or _fainting_\r\nevince the last prostration of the powers; but, when they return, or are\r\n_recurrent_, they indicate that the powers are weak, but that they are\r\nstruggling, contending, and have not yet submitted. As to the myuri, in\r\nregard to one pulsation, called _the failing_, and _the failing on both\r\nhands_ (innuentes et circumnuentes), these happen to persons who are\r\ngradually wasted by inflammations not yet resolved, and to those who are\r\nwasted from whatever cause, the bodies around the arteries being melted\r\ndown. Pulses of unequal velocity, and those called _dorcadissantes_ or\r\n_goat-leap_, principally accompany febrile heat. But if the pulse render\r\nthe commencement of the diastole feeble, and increase in velocity towards\r\nthe end and beginning of the systole, this indicates that putrefaction\r\nis prevailing, nature hastening on the discharge of the fuliginous\r\nsuperfluities. But if, on the other hand, it render the commencement\r\nof the systole feeble, and rather make speed towards the diastole, you\r\nmay be sure that the heat is prevailing, and longing for refrigeration.\r\nThese in fever are, for the most part, accompanied by density, and\r\nsometimes greatness, if the powers be not restrained by the hardness of\r\nthe instrument. When the hardness of the artery increases, and the powers\r\nare not weakened, the _double_ or _reverberating_ pulse is formed. The\r\n_undulatory_ pulse most commonly attends the more humid affections, such\r\nin particular as anasarcous swellings, lethargy, and peripneumony. When\r\nthe powers of life are beginning to fail, but are still making a faint\r\nstruggle, the undulatory pulse sinks into the _vermicular_; but when\r\nthey decline to their lowest ebb, this last passes into the _ant-like_\r\nor _formicans_. The hectic particularly attends those in consumption and\r\nmarasmus. The spasmodic pulse takes place when the origin of the nerves\r\nis suffering from some inflammatory affection, as in frenzy and acute\r\nattacks of epilepsy, when those affected with them die while they are\r\nyet warm, contrariwise to those in syncope, for they are alive after\r\nthey have become cold. The _clonodic_ or _vibratory_ pulse takes place\r\nwhen the wants of the system require a great diastole, and the vital\r\npowers are sufficient for that purpose, but are opposed by the body of\r\nthe artery; which, from its hardness, cannot be expanded to a large\r\ndiastole, as happens in great inflammations and chronic obstructions.\r\nThe _serrated_ pulse is indicative of inflammation, and particularly in\r\nsome tendinous parts. It is no less so of pleurisy, and when slight,\r\nindicates that the inflammation is gentle, and easily to be concocted;\r\nbut when intense, that it is severe and of difficult concoction, and will\r\nbe attended with urgent danger, if the powers be weak, or, if they be\r\nstrong, that it will be slowly concocted, for it will either terminate in\r\nempyema, or a consumptive marasmus will supervene. One ought also to know\r\nthat irregularity of the pulse commonly accompanies its inequalities;\r\nfor you will rarely find an unequal pulse orderly. Wherefore, the lesser\r\nconstitutional injuries occasion unequal and regular pulses, but the\r\ngreater, unequal and irregular.\r\n\r\nThese are the simple causes of the pulses and their prognosis, and from\r\nthem the compound, as we stated when treating of their differences, may\r\neasily be discovered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The ancient authorities on the pulse are the following:\r\nCelsus (iii, 6); Galen (Libel. de Pulsi. ad Tirones; de different. Puls.,\r\nde Dignos. Puls., de Caus. Puls., de Præsag. ex Puls., Synopsis librorum\r\nde Puls.); Philaretus (de Pulsu); Theophilus Protospatharius (de Pulsibus\r\nap. Ermerins Anecd. Med. Gr.); Actuarius (de Diagnosi); Avicenna (i, 2,\r\n3); Averrhoes (Collig. iv, 16); Haly Abbas (Theor. vii); Alsaharavius\r\n(Theor. vii); Rhases (ad Mansor. x, 32; Contin. xxxi); Psellus (Opus\r\nMedicum apud Boissonade, Anecdota Græca.)\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus gives an excellent exposition of the ancient doctrines\r\non the pulse (de præs. Vit. et Morte ægrot. iv, 3); Le Clerc’s account\r\nis not so accurate (Hist. de la Méd.) Wetsch’s is tolerably correct (de\r\nPulsu.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates, although Galen affirms that he was not entirely unacquainted\r\nwith the pulse, does not appear to have attached much importance to the\r\nobservation of it, for he generally neglects to mention its characters,\r\nwhere we would most expect to find them stated, as, for example, when he\r\nis detailing the symptoms of epidemical fevers. Celsus, too, expresses\r\nhimself in doubtful terms respecting the indications furnished by the\r\npulse: “Venis enim maxime credimus, fallacissimæ rei; quia sæpe istæ\r\nleniores, celerioresve sunt, et ætate, et sexu, et corporum naturâ; et\r\nplerumque satis sano corpore, si stomachus infirmus est, nonnunquam\r\netiam incipiente febre, subeunt et quiescunt; ut imbecillus is videri\r\npossit, cui facile laturo gravis instat accessio. Contra sæpe eas\r\nconcitat et resolvit sol, et balneum, et exercitatio, et metus, et ira,\r\net quilibet alius animi affectus.” Aretæus and Cælius Aurelianus are\r\nindeed sufficiently minute and accurate in detailing the characters\r\nof the pulse, while describing the symptoms of various diseases,\r\nbut neither of them has written expressly on the subject; and, as\r\nthe works of Herophilus, Agathinus, Magnus, Athenæus, and Archigenes\r\nare entirely lost, Galen must be considered as our first and great\r\nauthority on the pulse—we might almost have said our sole authority,\r\nfor all subsequent writers were content to adopt his system, without\r\nthe slightest alteration. As our author’s account of the subject is\r\nprofessedly taken from the elaborate treatises of Galen, it may, perhaps,\r\nappear unnecessary to attempt any further exposition of the system; but\r\nthe importance of the subject, and, we may add, its novelty to modern\r\nreaders, have induced us to make some detached observations upon it, in\r\norder to explain some parts of it which are confessedly obscure, and to\r\nanswer certain objections which have been stated against it, by modern\r\nwriters who have not properly understood its principles.\r\n\r\nWe shall first notice the objection stated to Galen’s Theory of\r\nRespiration by Van Helmont, who, although compelled to admit the\r\ningenuity of Galen’s system, pretends to differ from him respecting the\r\nfinal cause of arterial action and respiration, which, he maintains, is\r\nnot refrigeration, but the maintenance of animal heat. (Opera, p. 112.)\r\nBut if he had read Galen’s work ‘de Usu Respirationis’ carefully, he\r\nwould have found that this is the very sense which Galen attaches to\r\nthe terms refrigeration and ventilation. Van Helmont states, as a new\r\ndiscovery, that a sort of concoction of the blood takes place in the left\r\nventricle of the heart. But he might have found this doctrine also in the\r\nworks of Galen.\r\n\r\nAccording to Galen, the pulse consists of four parts: of a diastole and\r\na systole with two intervals of rest, one after the diastole before\r\nthe systole, and the other after the systole before the diastole.\r\nHe maintains that by practice and attention all these parts can be\r\ndistinguished. (De Dignos. Puls. iii, 3.)\r\n\r\nThe first distinctions of the pulse are derived from the extent of the\r\ndiastole, according to its three dimensions, namely, length, breadth, and\r\ndepth. These give rise to the characters _long_, _broad_, and _deep_ or\r\n_high_. Le Clerc renders the last by _élevé_. A long pulse, of course,\r\nrefers solely to the impression on the finger, as in reality one pulse\r\ncannot properly be said to be longer than another; but when a person is\r\nlean a larger portion of the artery can be felt under the finger than\r\nwhen he is fat.\r\n\r\nThe character _deep_ or _high_ is easily understood, and is evidently\r\nproduced by a free dilatation of the artery. It does not indeed appear\r\nevident how there can be a difference between a _deep_ and a _broad_\r\npulse, if the dilatation of an artery were equal on all sides; but Galen\r\npositively affirms that it is a fact ascertained by ample experience,\r\nthat sometimes there is a free dilatation of the artery upwards with a\r\ncontracted one laterally, constituting a _high_ and _narrow_ pulse; and,\r\non the other hand, that there is often a free dilatation laterally with a\r\ncontracted one upwards, constituting a _low_ and _broad_ pulse. He gives\r\ndirections for detecting these peculiarities of the artery. (De Diff.\r\nPuls. iii, 2.)\r\n\r\nThe characters of _quick_ and _slow_ are derived from the length of\r\ntime occupied in the actions of systole and diastole. They seem to\r\nbe sufficiently well marked, and yet Fyens denied that there is any\r\ndifference between _frequency_ and _quickness_. However, many of our\r\nlate authorities in medicine acknowledge a distinction between these two\r\ncharacters, and they appear to us sufficiently obvious. In fact, Galen\r\nestablishes the distinction in the most satisfactory manner. (De Dignos.\r\nii.)\r\n\r\nThe distinctions of _strong_ and _feeble_ are derived from the force with\r\nwhich the artery strikes the finger. No one can possibly mistake them.\r\n\r\nThe relaxation and constriction of the arterial tube give rise to the\r\ncharacters of _soft_ and _hard_, which are so obvious that they cannot be\r\nmisunderstood. The character of _hardness_ is called _tension_ by Galen,\r\nwho states that it is characteristic of inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe next class of pulses derive their characters from the time which\r\nelapses between two diastoles or pulsations of the artery. They are\r\ncalled _dense_ and _rare_, in the ancient system, being used in the same\r\nsense that _frequent_ and _slow_ are in modern works.\r\n\r\nThe terms _equal_ and _unequal_ (or, as they might have been translated,\r\n_equable_ and _unequable_) arise from the constancy or inconstancy\r\nof any peculiar character of the arterial pulsation. The _regular_\r\nand _irregular_ are distinguished from these, inasmuch as a series of\r\npulsations, although unequal may be regular, when they observe a certain\r\nratio, as when four strong pulsations are succeeded by a feeble one, and\r\nthis series goes on successively.\r\n\r\nAn inequality may take place in respect to one pulsation; for the\r\ndilatation of the artery may be interrupted, and then completed, when\r\nit is called _dorcadissans_, _caprizans_ or _goat-leap_; or the stroke\r\nmay be suddenly repeated, when it is called _dicrotos_, which may be\r\ntranslated the _double_, _reverberating_, or _rebounding_ pulse. The term\r\n_dorcadissans_ is derived from _dorcas_, an animal generally supposed\r\nto have been the goat, but it is now satisfactorily ascertained that it\r\nwas the _antelope dorcas_ or _gazelle_; and, in the Latin translations\r\nof Avicenna and Haly Abbas, it is rendered _gazellans_. It is said that\r\nwhen this animal leaps upwards it at first takes a short spring, then\r\nseems to make a sudden stop, and afterwards takes a much larger and\r\nswifter bound. This character was applied to the pulse when an imperfect\r\ndilatation of the artery is succeeded by a fuller and a stronger one.\r\n(Galen, de diff. Puls. i, 28.) It is thus described by Haly Abbas:\r\n“Gazellans pulsus est qui cum a celeritate incipiat antequam percussiat\r\nstat, dehinc velociter movetur: vocatur autem hujusmodi gazelenus suâ ex\r\nsimilitudine caprioli saltu: quum capriolus quem Gazel Arabicè vocant cum\r\nsaltum dederit pedes tollit et suspensus pauco videtur tempore atque sic\r\nad terram velociùs redit.” The translator of Alsaharavius renders it by\r\n_fusalis_. It is correctly stated by Fouquet that the second pulsation\r\nis necessarily larger than the first. The _dicrotos_ consists of two\r\npulsations, following upon one another so rapidly as to form, as it were,\r\nbut one beat of the artery. In the translation of Alsaharavius it is\r\ncalled _mallearis_, and is thus defined: “Est autem pulsus mallearis qui\r\npercutit manum et recedit, deinde redit et percutit secundario.”\r\n\r\nWhen there is a succession of pulsations which diminish in magnitude\r\nregularly, such a system of pulses is called myuri, that is to say,\r\n_decurtate_ or _sharp-tailed_, from their supposed resemblance to the\r\ntapering tail of a mouse. Those who are acquainted with the Scholiast\r\non Hephæstion, and the other ancient writers on prosody, will readily\r\nrecognize a term with which they are familiar. Galen inclines to the\r\nopinion that this state of the artery is connected with an intemperament\r\nof the portion where the expansion is limited. Of these pulses, some\r\nend in complete asphyxia, and hence are called _swooning_, _failing_,\r\nor _fainting_ myuri, (Le Clerc renders it by _le myurus defaillant_;)\r\nand others again gradually recover their former magnitude, and are\r\ncalled _recurrent myuri_. Nearly allied to these are the _innuentes\r\net circumnuentes_, for which it is scarcely possible to find any\r\nappropriate term in English. Le Clerc thus renders and explains this\r\npulse, in French: “Le myurus _qui va en baissant de côté et d’autre_,\r\nc’est a dire qui frappe moins sensiblement le premier et le dernier\r\ndoigt que celui ou ceux du milieu.” It consists, as Avicenna explains,\r\nof a double myurus, which swells out in the middle, and diminishes at\r\nboth extremities. It was therefore a sort of double inclined plane.\r\nThe myurus, and the innuens et circumnuens, are thus described by Haly\r\nAbbas: “Est autem et in hac specie unius pulsationis pulsus qui _muris\r\ncauda_ appellatur; quique inclinus vocatur pulsus. Et qui muris cauda\r\nvocatur fit cum arteria dilatatur sub primo digito qui a superioribus\r\nest grossa, et sub secundo minus grossa, sub tertio parva, sub quarto\r\nminima. _Inclinus_ autem pulsus est qui sub duobus mediis movetur digitis\r\ngrossus et sub extremis hinc et inde subtilis et tenuis; aut medium ejus\r\nelatum est, et extremitates demissæ, videturque tangenti arteriæ extrema\r\nad inferiora declinari.” Sprengel appears to think that the _pulsus\r\ninclinus_ of Haly Abbas is one first described by him, but there can\r\nbe no doubt of its being identical with the _innuens et circumnuens_\r\n(νενυκὼς καὶ περινενευκὼς) of Galen’s system. It is likewise the same as\r\nthe _pulsus inclinatus_ of Rhases, who says it occurs in hectic fevers\r\nand consumption. Galen attempts to explain this pulse by referring it to\r\nweakness of the vessel and an unequal wasting of the parts around, which\r\nconvey the impression, when several fingers are applied together, as if\r\nthe vessel swelled out in the middle. (De Diff. Puls. ii.)\r\n\r\nIn the _spasmodic_ pulse, the artery is said to convey the sensation of\r\na string or cord tightly stretched, which, when touched, starts from its\r\nplace. It seems to be the _pulsus tortuosus_ of Alsaharavius, and is\r\ncommonly met with when convulsions are impending.\r\n\r\nThe _vibratory_ derives its name from an imaginary resemblance to the\r\nmotions of a rod or dart when thrown into the air, and it can only take\r\nplace when the artery is hard, and the strength good. Le Clerc renders it\r\n_le pouls dardant_. It is generally named _thrilling_ in modern works.\r\nAccording to Actuarius, it is hard, quick, and dense, and indicates\r\ninflammation of nervous parts.\r\n\r\nThe _undulatory_ derives its name from a supposed resemblance to the\r\nrolling of the waves, and can only take place when the artery is\r\nparticularly soft, being accompanied with an unequal elevation of it\r\nin the diastole. It is thus described by Rhases: “Undosus vero est qui\r\nsecundum latitudinem, magnum digiti occupat locum, cum lenitate et\r\nrepletione, cum eo tamen non est magna elevatio neque subita, sed videtur\r\nquod elevationem ejus una post aliam contingit, donec fit ut undis\r\nassimilatur, quarum una aliam sequitur.” It is the _pulsus fluctuosus_ of\r\nHaly Abbas, and the _pulsus fluens_ of C. Aurelianus. (Morb. Acut. ii,\r\n32.) Le Clerc renders it _ondoyant_.\r\n\r\nThe _vermicular_ differs from the last mentioned only in magnitude\r\nand strength, being soft, small, and weak. Nearly allied to it is\r\nthe _formicans_ or _ant-like_ pulse, which is one of the last degree\r\nof weakness, smallness, and density. They are thus described by\r\nRhases: “Vermicolosi forma est ut forma undosi, in elevatione quæ\r\nsecundum diastolem eadem invenitur, non tamen est latus, neque plenus,\r\ncujus inundatio existit debilis, qui vermibus per foramen arteriæ\r\ndiscurrentibus assimulatur: formicans vero pulsus adeo invenitur in\r\nultimo parvitatis, et spissitudinis consistere, ut pulsui pueri recens\r\nnati assimuletur.” According to Galen the _formicans_ is a pulse which it\r\nrequires great experience to detect. (De Dignos. Puls. ii, 1.) Haly Abbas\r\nstates that it is the termination of the vermicular. It is the _pulsus\r\nformicabilis_ of Cælius Aurelianus. The Chinese compare the formicans to\r\na silk thread, a capillary tube, or a hair.\r\n\r\nThe _intermittent_ and _intercurrent_ pulses are opposed to one another,\r\nthere being a complete failure of a pulsation in the one case, and an\r\naccessory or superfluous one in the other. There cannot be a better proof\r\nof the imperfection in our modern systems of the pulse, than that there\r\nshould be no mention in them of the intercurrent pulse.\r\n\r\nThe _hectic_ pulse, it is well known, is small and dense. Alexander\r\nTrallian says, small and feeble. (xii, 4.)\r\n\r\nThe _serrated_ is hard, quick, and unequal in its feel. Rhases says that\r\nit is principally observed in inflammations of the pleura and diaphragm.\r\nAccording to Actuarius, the pulse characteristic of inflammation is\r\nserrated and hard, more especially if seated in a tendinous part. (Meth.\r\nMed. i, 25.) Le Clerc renders it _le pouls en manière de scie_. (Hist. de\r\nla Méd. p. iii, l. iii, c. 3.) It appears to correspond with the pulse\r\ncalled _harsh_ in the works of English writers on medicine.\r\n\r\nBorden speaks of the terms _formicans_, _myurus_, and _caprizans_ as\r\nhaving been justly banished from our modern nomenclatures. But it may be\r\ndoubted whether it be from superior information or from ignorance that\r\nwe have rejected these nice distinctions. Some of these terms were in\r\nuse long before the time of Galen, (he mentions that Herophilus used the\r\nterm _dorcadissans_,) and for more than a thousand years afterwards the\r\ncharacters of the pulse to which they were applied were acknowledged as\r\nreal; and, on a matter depending solely upon experience and observation,\r\nthe concurring suffrages of so many ages must be admitted to be entitled\r\nto some consideration. That many of the Greek and Arabian physicians were\r\nmen of great learning and of much practical skill in medicine cannot\r\nadmit of a doubt; and therefore their opinions ought not to be hastily\r\nrejected as visionary and unfounded. Galen, indeed, expresses in strong\r\nterms the difficulty which he found in defining accurately the states of\r\nthe artery to which the terms we are treating of are applied, and warns\r\nthe reader that such characters are to be detected only by a person well\r\nexperienced in the art of feeling pulses, which he pronounces to be\r\none not easily attained. (Synops. viii.) Alsaharavius insists strongly\r\non the necessity of having a nice sense of touch, and that it be well\r\ncultivated in order to attain the tact of feeling pulses properly. Haly\r\nAbbas and Actuarius in like manner state the difficulty and importance of\r\nthe art of feeling pulses. It is to be borne in mind that the ancients\r\nperformed the operation of feeling the pulse more methodically than is\r\nnow generally done, which may in part account for our having lost sight\r\nof some of the nicer shades of distinction which they recognized. It is\r\nworthy of remark, further, that the truly learned and experienced Prosper\r\nAlpinus recognized and described these characters of the pulse which we\r\nhave been treating of. (De pr. Vit. et Morte ægrot.)\r\n\r\nWhoever will consult Galen’s treatises on the pulse will find discussed\r\nin them many subtle questions which are now seldom thought of. For\r\nexample, he enters into a disquisition whether or not we can perceive\r\nthe systole of the artery. He informs us that Agathinus had denied and\r\nHerophilus affirmed the possibility of this. He, after having, as he\r\nsays, examined the matter fully, agrees with the latter. (De Dignosc.\r\nPuls. i, 3.)\r\n\r\nPsellus gives the characters of the pulses in not inelegant politic\r\nverses. A very clear and satisfactory description of them is given in the\r\nshort treatise of Theophilus Protospatharius.\r\n\r\nThe causes which produce all these varieties of pulse, and the changes\r\nof the system which they indicate, are, upon the whole, pretty clearly\r\nexplained by our author; and the reader who wishes to consult other\r\nabridgments of the doctrines of Galen, may find them in the works of\r\nRhases, Haly Abbas, and Actuarius. We shall merely make a few more\r\nremarks upon some of the more obscure and least understood parts of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nRespecting the myuri, Galen states that they all indicate a prostration\r\nof the vital powers, but differing in degree, according to circumstances.\r\nWhen the pulse gradually becomes smaller, and in like manner recovers its\r\nmagnitude gradually, and so on alternately, so as to form the _recurrent\r\nmyuri_, it indicates an inferior degree of prostration; and, when the\r\ndiminished state of pulsation continues permanent, a greater degree of\r\noppression is indicated. In the former case the powers of the system seem\r\nable to struggle against the load, but in the latter they are completely\r\novercome. This state is next in danger to that of complete asphyxia.\r\nThese three are the worst kinds of pulse. The _intermitting_ is said\r\nby him to be allied to these, being indicative of great danger, though\r\ninferior to that of those we have mentioned. Next to the intermitting\r\nis the _intercurrent_, which indicates that the powers of the system\r\nare strong, but oppressed, and contending against some great load.\r\nGalen was particularly apprehensive of the _intermitting_ pulse, which\r\nhe held to indicate that the system is struggling against some urgent\r\ncause. He remarks, however, that, when the pulse is otherwise strong and\r\nfrequent, it indicates less danger than when it is weak and slow. But,\r\nupon the whole, he considered this kind of pulse so full of danger, that\r\nhe affirms he had never known a person recover whose pulse intermitted\r\nduring the interval of two pulsations. When the pulse intermits during\r\nthe space of only one pulsation or a little more, he says he had often\r\nseen the patient recover. He also states that an intermitting pulse\r\nis less dangerous in old persons than in adults or children. Some,\r\nhe says, affirm that they have seen cases of intermission which did\r\nnot prove dangerous, but he believes that they had confounded rarity\r\nwith intermission. The intermitting is to be distinguished from the\r\nrare by the length of the time of rest, and by the latter being often\r\nequable, whereas the former is always unequable. He says it is generally\r\noccasioned by frigidity of the heart. These doctrines may be traced\r\nthrough all the subsequent authorities, both Greek and Arabian, down to\r\nActuarius.\r\n\r\nGalen, Rhases, and Haly Abbas repeatedly inculcate that the undulatory\r\npulse indicates an approaching crisis by a sweat. They describe it as\r\nbeing strong, full, soft, bounding, and unequable. According to Galen it\r\nis most commonly met with in lethargic affections, quotidian, marsh, and\r\ntyphoid fevers. (De Præs. ii, 9.) It is also said to be common in sudden\r\nattacks of dropsy. (Ib.) In some instances, however, it is the precursor\r\nof some critical evacuation, such as that by the hemorrhoids, or by the\r\nbowels. (Synops. 22.) Actuarius particularly states that critical sweats\r\nare indicated by the undulatory pulse. (Meth. Med. ii, 2.)\r\n\r\nThe _dicrotos_ is distinguished by a smaller pulsation suddenly\r\nsucceeding to a larger one. Galen compares it to a hammer, which, when\r\nforcibly struck against the anvil, rebounds, and strikes it again. The\r\nartery in such cases is always strong and vibratory. Philaretus describes\r\nthe pulsation as being hard, vehement, and rebounding. Galen says it can\r\nonly occur when the powers of the system are strong, the artery hard, and\r\nthe body oppressed with a redundance of humours. He repeatedly inculcates\r\nthat it indicates an approaching crisis.\r\n\r\nThe singular pulse called _dorcadissans_, which we have translated\r\n_goat-leap_, is said by Galen to occur most frequently in affections of\r\nthe heart and inflammations of the parts within the chest. (De Prognos.\r\nii, 8.) It is the same as the pulse now called _jerking_, which the best\r\nauthorities agree to be characteristic of pericarditis. In such cases,\r\nHope says, the pulse is “full, hard, _jerking_, and often with a thrill.”\r\n(Diseases of the Heart, p. 99.) We suspect the modern term _jerking_,\r\nalthough perfectly intelligible to one experienced in the art of feeling\r\npulses with discrimination, will be found fully as difficult to define as\r\nthe _dorcadissans_ of the ancients.\r\n\r\nThe _vermicular_ appears to have been the same as that which is now\r\nsometimes denominated _creeping_. In fact, Galen derives its name from\r\nits resemblance to the motion of a creature _creeping_. (Synops. 22.)\r\nIt is said by the ancient authorities to occur in cases of sudden\r\nprostration of the vital powers, produced by inordinate evacuations, such\r\nas hemorrhage, cholera, diarrhœa, and the like. (De Prognos. Puls. ii.)\r\n\r\nThe pulse called _innuens et circumnuens_, is said to occur only in cases\r\nof extreme debility and danger, more especially when attended with a\r\ngreat chill. It is connected, says Galen, with idiosyncrasy. (De Præs.\r\nii, 11.) Is it the same as the pulse now named _flickering_?\r\n\r\nGalen gives the following ingenious explanation why the pulse is\r\ncontracted and frequent, in cases of acute inflammations. He remarks\r\nthat, if a person have an inflammation in a limb, he will experience\r\nmost ease in a state of complete rest; but if obliged, by some urgent\r\nnecessity, to perform a journey, he will find that he can accomplish this\r\nmost easily by taking short and frequent steps. In like manner, when\r\nany part is inflamed, it would afford most relief if the motion of the\r\narteries could be altogether suspended for a time; but, as this cannot\r\nbe, nature renders the dilatation as confined as possible, and makes up\r\nfor its smallness by frequency. (De Usu Respirationis.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XIII.—ON THE ALVINE DISCHARGES.\r\n\r\nOf the alvine discharges, the best is that which is soft and compact, and\r\nis evacuated at the hour which is customary in health. Such excrement is\r\nyellowish, of the proper consistence, and not very fetid; for whatever is\r\ndifferent from these is not good. That which resembles in colour the food\r\nwhich has been taken, or is thin, wants the natural juices, and is passed\r\nquickly, is indigested. But that which is intensely yellow, if evacuated\r\nin the beginning of a disease, indicates that the complaint is of a very\r\nbilious nature; but if after the acme, that the body is properly purged.\r\nThe green is the sign of verdigris-green bile, but the black of black\r\nbile, or of adust blood mixed with it. The livid marks a coldness and\r\nconsiderable mortification of the internal parts. The oily is the mark of\r\na melting of the fat in the body; as the glutinous, which is worse than\r\nthe oily, is a mark of a melting of the parts of the animal. That which\r\nis very fetid is a mark of no small degree of putridity. With regard\r\nto them all, if the quality of the excrements does not correspond with\r\nthe food which had been taken, you may thus judge of the affection. Of\r\nall kinds, the worst and most fatal is black, livid, oily, and what is\r\nhastily passed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See, in particular, Hippocrates (Prognost.); and Galen (de\r\nCrisibus, xi.) Galen remarks that the stomach may do its office properly,\r\nbut that, owing to the heat of the neighbouring parts, the moisture may\r\nbe dissipated, and the contents of the bowels rendered too dry; or that,\r\nowing to an imperfect distribution of the chyle, they may be too liquid.\r\nWhen the alvine discharges are soft and consistent, we are certain that\r\nboth the digestive and distributive functions are properly performed, and\r\nlikewise, that no part within the belly is in a state of inflammation. He\r\nafterwards makes many other ingenious observations on this subject, the\r\nimportance of which, towards the restoration of health, is now generally\r\nadmitted. He remarks, that, agreeably to the description of Hippocrates\r\n(Prognost.) the proper alvine evacuation ought to be yellowish; for, if\r\nvery yellow, it indicates the presence of too much bile, or, if it do not\r\npartake of that colour at all, it indicates that the passage of the bile\r\nto the intestines is stopped. Rhases and Avicenna concur in this remark.\r\nGalen describes the frothy evacuation, which appears to be the same as\r\nthe one resembling yeast, described by modern authorities. Hippocrates\r\n(Progn.) and Galen makes mention of a discharge, which consists of\r\nsmall, hard, and convoluted portions. Galen is of opinion that it\r\nis occasioned by constipation and heat of the bowels. According to\r\nHippocrates, a discharge of black bile indicates that death is at hand.\r\n(Aphor.) Theophilus treats of this subject at such length that we cannot\r\nafford room for a proper outline of what is contained in his treatise.\r\nBloody evacuations, he says, proceed either from disorder of the liver,\r\nulceration of the intestines, or rupture of a vessel. Discharges of\r\npus may come either from the liver, or from the stomach, or from the\r\nintestines. A viscid and fatty evacuation indicates melting of the body,\r\nand if attended with a fetid smell, putrefaction. Flatus in the bowels\r\nmay either arise from flatulent humours forming in the bowels, or food\r\ndissolved into gases by the heat of the parts. (De Excrementis.)\r\n\r\nThe account of this subject given by Haly Abbas (Theor. vii, 16, and x,\r\n10) is excellent, but principally collected from the Greek writers. An\r\nunctuous discharge, he remarks, is occasioned by a melting of the fat.\r\nIf it be viscid at the same time, it indicates also a wasting of the\r\nprincipal members. A frothy discharge proceeds from heat and flatulence.\r\nA green evacuation indicates immoderate heat, and the presence of\r\nbile. Black discharges consist either of black bile, or of common bile\r\nblackened by immoderate heat. This, he says, is the worst appearance of\r\nall. If blood is discharged after the fæces, it may be supposed to come\r\nfrom the small intestines; but if before, from the large; and if mixed\r\nwith the fæces, it probably comes from the intermediate parts. See also\r\nAlsaharavius (Theor. ix), and Rhases (Cont. xxxi.) Rhases states that\r\nwhite fæces arise from jaundice. When the discharges are watery, the\r\nnourishment of the body is stopt.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of Hippocrates and Galen on this subject are correctly\r\nstated and explained by Prosper Alpinus (De Præsag. Vita et Morte ægrot.\r\nvii, 11.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XIV.—ON THE INDICATIONS FROM THE URINE.\r\n\r\nAs concerning the alvine discharges, so also with respect to the urine;\r\nusing that of healthy persons as a rule, we shall hence form our\r\nindications of that of persons in disease. That urine, therefore, is\r\nbest, which is nearest to that of healthy persons. Such is that which\r\nis at the same time of a faintish golden, or faintish saffron colour,\r\nand which, moreover, is moderate as to consistence. There are three\r\nvarieties of turbid urine; for, either straightway after being voided it\r\ndeposits a sediment; or it always remains the same; or it is voided pure,\r\nbut afterwards becomes turbid; of these, the third is bad, the first\r\nfavorable the second intermediate between them. That which is wholly\r\nunconcocted, being altogether watery, is symptomatic of digestion being\r\nentirely gone in the venous system; and when it is passed frequently, the\r\ndisease is called diabetes, which is the worst of unconcocted urines.\r\nNext to these is the thin and white urine, which resembles water. Nearly\r\nallied to these, is another kind of urine, appearing in many diseases,\r\nand which is very like to the thin and white. The palish is next to\r\nthis. The pale may also be of a faintish golden colour, and is concocted\r\nin proportion as it partakes of this colour. It ought, however, to be\r\nas much different from water in thickness as in colour, if it is to be\r\nproperly concocted. But if it preserve exactly its natural colour, and\r\nhave a white, smooth, equable, and copious sediment, it is indicative of\r\nperfect digestion. A greater quantity than natural indicates that a crude\r\nhumour is purged off; but if it is somewhat thicker than natural, and has\r\na certain sediment, it is not then altogether unconcocted. But if it have\r\ngritty, scaly, furfuraceous, black, livid, green, or fetid sediments,\r\nsuch urine is altogether unconcocted and particularly mortal. But urine\r\nof a proper colour, and which at the same time has white, smooth, and\r\nequable sediments, or certain cloud-like appearances, or substances\r\nswimming in the middle of a like kind, is of all others the best. Of\r\nthese characters, the sediment is of the most importance; next, the\r\nsubstances swimming in it; and third, the cloud-like appearances on its\r\nsurface; and, on the whole, of the substances which float in the urine,\r\nthe more they sink downwards so much the better.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Hippocrates (Prognost. ii, et de Vict. Acut. c. 46);\r\nGalen (Comment. de Crisibus, i, 12); Celsus (ii, 7); Theophilus (de\r\nUrinis); Actuarius (de Urinis); Abicianus (de Urinis; De Urinis secundum\r\nSyros, de Urinis secundum Persas, de Urinis Commentatio, ap. Phys. et\r\nMed. Græc. Minor. ed. Ideler); Aëtius (v); Avicenna (iv, 2, 1, Cantic.\r\np. 1); Averrhoes (Collig. iv, 21); Haly Abbas (Theor. iv, 12, x, 10);\r\nAlsaharavius (Theor. viii); Rhases (ad Mansor. x, 30, and Contin. xxxi);\r\nPsellus (Opus Medicum.)\r\n\r\nOf the ancient authorities who have treated of the urinary discharges,\r\nTheophilus and Actuarius are most particularly deserving of attention.\r\nBesides the watery portion, the ancients distinguished three distinct\r\nsubstances in the urine: 1st, the hypostasis or sediment, which is the\r\npart that falls to the bottom; 2d, the enæorema, or substances which\r\nfloat in the watery part, but have not weight to subside; 3d, the\r\nnubeculæ, or cloud-like appearances seen floating on the surface, or\r\nas they may be called the scum. All the different appearances which\r\nthese substances put on, including every imaginary shade of colour, are\r\ndescribed with surprising minuteness, and connected with the morbid\r\nconditions of the system which gives rise to them. In fact, there is no\r\npart of our task which we are obliged to discharge in so unsatisfactory\r\na manner to ourselves as the present; for, to give our readers anything\r\nlike a competent exposition of the knowledge possessed by the ancients on\r\nthe morbid appearances of the urine, we would require to transfer to our\r\npages the whole contents of the large treatise of Actuarius. We shall now\r\ngive a few extracts from his work and that of Theophilus. They state that\r\nthe urine of sedentary persons has more sediment than that of persons\r\nwho pursue an active course of life; that the urine of women, from this\r\ncause, has generally more sediment than that of men; that of children\r\nmore than that of adults; and that of persons who live grossly, than\r\nthe urine of temperate persons. Theophilus thus delivers the characters\r\nof oily urine. When in fevers the urine assumes the colour of oil, it\r\nindicates that the fat of the body is melting down. When the appearances\r\nof the urine resemble oil still more, it indicates an increase of the\r\nmelting of the fat; and when the urine in consistence and colour appears\r\nexactly like oil of a dark colour, it prognosticates a collapse and\r\ndeath. (§ 17.) This accords with what is stated in one of the aphorisms\r\nof Hippocrates: “When in ardent fevers the urine has an oily sediment,\r\nit prognosticates death.” The tare-like urine, as it was called from the\r\nresemblance of the sediments to the colour of the tare (_ervum ervilia_),\r\nbut which might be better called the grumous, since, as Actuarius\r\nexplains, they bear a close resemblance to clots of blood, is said by\r\nTheophilus to be indicative of melting of the flesh. The scaly urine\r\nderived its name from small substances resembling the husks or hulls of\r\ngrain in the urine, and in febrile diseases was supposed to indicate\r\ngreat disorder of the general system, but otherwise to be connected\r\nwith an affection of the bladder. The furfuraceous, which derived its\r\nname from the resemblance of the sediments to bran, was also held to\r\nbe symptomatic of local disease of the bladder, or of constitutional\r\ndisorder in fever. The gritty, so called from the resemblance of the\r\nsubstances in the water of the urine to large particles of ground grain,\r\nwas reckoned by all the authorities, from Hippocrates downwards, as a\r\nvery bad symptom in fevers. Fetid urine was supposed to indicate melting\r\nor putrefaction of the body. Actuarius gives a curious account of urine\r\nwithout sediment, which he ascribes to its being attracted to some part\r\nof the system which is the seat of inflammation or erysipelas. (v, 5.)\r\nThe enæorema, or substances in the middle of the urine, are said by\r\nActuarius sometimes to resemble spiders’ webs, sometimes specks of oil\r\nlike what appears in fat broth when cooled, and at other times hairs, as\r\nwill be more fully stated elsewhere. The nebulæ, or scum on the urine,\r\nis said to put on various appearances, as, for example, that of bullæ or\r\nbubbles, of which mention will be made in another place. From a passage\r\nin Theophilus (v, 8), it may be inferred that the ancients sometimes\r\napplied external heat as a test of the characters of the urine. On the\r\nmain the differences in the colours of the urine were held to depend on\r\nthe mixture of bile in the urine, and sometimes, though rarely, of blood.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of the doctrines of the Arabians, although, in fact,\r\nentirely borrowed from the Greeks, we shall select a few of the\r\nobservations of Haly Abbas and Alsaharavius. According to Haly, thinness\r\nof the urine indicates deficient digestion. Thickness, on the other\r\nhand, is the product of excessive digestion, or arises from the presence\r\nof pituitous humours in the body. When the sediment is white, it is a\r\nfavorable symptom; when yellow, it is from yellow bile; when red, it\r\nis from a sanguineous plethora and imperfect digestion; and if of long\r\ncontinuance, it must proceed from inflammation of the liver. If, after\r\nintense redness, the urine becomes black, it is a most fatal symptom.\r\nWhen the urine is moderately fetid, it is connected with indigestion;\r\nbut when very fetid, with putrefaction. Alsaharavius delivers the\r\ncharacters of the different kinds of urine in nearly the same terms. He\r\nproperly cautions the physician not to allow himself to be imposed upon\r\nby the colour of the urine, which may sometimes acquire a tinge from the\r\npatient’s having taken saffron, cassia-fistula, or the like. Such tricks,\r\nhe says, are often practised upon water doctors. According to Rhases,\r\nit is an unfavorable symptom when the urine does not become turbid in\r\nthe course of the fever. Yellow urine without sediment is said to be\r\nunfavorable.\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus has stated correctly the doctrines of Hippocrates\r\nand Galen, but is entirely silent respecting those of Theophilus and\r\nActuarius. (u. a.)\r\n\r\nBesides the ancient authors referred to by us in this chapter, the works\r\nof the following writers _de Urinis_ exist in manuscript, but have never\r\nbeen published: 1, Athenæus, quoted by DuCange (ex Cod. Colbert, 3614);\r\n2, Constantinus Africanus (in Bibl. Cæsarea); 3, Joannes Episcopus (Cod.\r\nReg. 3497); 4, Maximus Planudes and Meletius Monachus (Cod. Reg. 3175);\r\n5, Nicephorus Blemmydes (in Bibl. Cæsarea); 6, Anonymus, &c. (Cod. Colb.\r\n3614 and 4230, et in Bibl. Cæsar.); 7, Piropulus (in Bibl. Corsliniana,\r\n448.) See Fabricii (Bibl. Grac. xiii, 779.) The treatise of Abicianus,\r\nnoticed by Fabricius, has been published by Ideler. It proves to be a\r\nmere compilation from the works of Avicenna.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XV.—ON THE INDICATIONS FROM THE SPUTA.\r\n\r\nSuch as are somewhat yellow, golden, frothy, and thin, indicate only want\r\nof concoction, but nothing positively bad. But such as are intensely\r\nyellow, golden, frothy, green, viscid, round, and still more the black,\r\nare bad. For, with the exception of the blood, whatever of the other\r\nhumours is unmixed, indicates a bad diathesis, having its origin in an\r\ninflammatory heat. The bloody sputa are of an intermediate character, but\r\nthose of yellow and black bile are unfavorable. The manner in which they\r\nare brought up ought also to be considered; for, if they are readily spit\r\nup, it is clear that such are good, whereas the contrary are bad. It is\r\nan indication of complete concoction that the expectoration is unctuous,\r\nwhite, and equable, and in consistence, neither fluid nor very thick; as\r\nit is of a complete failure of concoction that it is not spit up at all.\r\nIf it is indeed spit up, but thin, it is a mark of feeble concoction. If\r\nit is of an unmixed yellow or golden colour, it is not good. But if it is\r\nlivid, of a verdigris-green, or black, it is a most fatal symptom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen has treated fully of this subject in his work (de\r\nCrisibus, ii, 10.) See also Hippocrates (Prognost. and Coacæ), and Celsus\r\n(ii, 9.) Aëtius is somewhat fuller than our author (v, 52.) See Avicenna\r\n(iv, 2); Averrhoes (Cantic. i, 2); Haly Abbas (Theor. vii and x, 10);\r\nRhases (ad Mansor. x, 24.)\r\n\r\nWe shall be content with giving a few of the observations of the\r\nArabians, of whom Haly is the most full and accurate upon this head. The\r\nlungs and the other parts within the chest being the organs of life,\r\nwhen affected, they occasion inflammation of the heart. Expectoration\r\nindicates some affection of those parts. When the expectoration is thin\r\nand small in quantity, the disease is not concocted; when the sputa are\r\nof moderate consistence and equable, the disease is at its acme; when\r\nthick, it is certainly on the decline. Thinness indicates that the humour\r\nwhich occasions the complaint is of a subtle nature; thickness, the\r\ncontrary. Blackness indicates vehement heat. Green sputa are indicative\r\nof the presence of green bile, white of phlegm, and redness of blood.\r\nWhen fetid, they proceed from putrefaction. Black sputa indicate great\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus makes many ingenious remarks on the characters of the\r\nsputa. (De Vita et Morte ægrot. vii, 19.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XVI.—THE DIAGNOSIS AND CURE OF EPHEMERAL FEVERS.\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiar and inseparable symptom of ephemeral fevers, that\r\nconcoction of the urine takes place on the first day; and a pleasant\r\nstate of the heat is likewise peculiar and inseparable from such fevers.\r\nAfter the first resolution of the fever, you will have a still more\r\nconfident diagnosis; for the motion of the arteries then becomes similar\r\nto that of persons in health, whereas no other fever returns so soon to\r\nthe natural state. And it is also a very great mark of this fever that\r\nthe patient bears it well. Those persons are readily seized with this\r\ncomplaint in whom the perspirations are not vaporous, but very acrid, as\r\nif containing something fuliginous. Such are they who are of a hot and\r\ndry temperament, and, in fine, those who are troubled with bitter bile.\r\nThose who are seized with this fever from fatigue should be rubbed softly\r\nwith oil and bathed; but those from dryness, are to be rubbed less and\r\nbathed more. Those from cares, grief, watchfulness, or anger, are not to\r\nbe bathed often, but slightly rubbed with plenty of tepid oil possessed\r\nof little stypticity; and bathed according to habit. Those who have\r\nbeen seized with the fever from inordinate heat are to be treated from\r\nthe commencement with cooling things and more baths, but by no means\r\nwith much oil and friction. The cooling things should be rose oil, or\r\ncold oil of unripe olives, prepared without salts. The same are to be\r\npoured upon the open of the head, and the bath used when the fever has\r\npassed its acme. If a person has a fever from congelation, he is to be\r\nbathed in the decline; but if the fever be attended with catarrh, he is\r\nnot to be bathed until concoction takes place; but those who have fever\r\nfrom exposure to heat are to be bathed while these symptoms are present.\r\nThose from exposure to cold are to be warmed moderately, and have the\r\nhead bathed with such applications as the oil of iris and of nard. To\r\nthose in whom the fever is occasioned by constriction of the skin, the\r\nproper remedies are, tepid baths of sweet waters, friction to open the\r\npores, exercises, and an exhilarating diet. Those in whom the fever is\r\noccasioned by want of food are to be led to the bath after the decline of\r\nthe first paroxysm, and to have plenty of tepid oil poured upon them; are\r\nto be rubbed most gently, and to remain for the greater part of the time\r\nin the cistern of the warm bath. After coming out and recovering their\r\nstrength, they are to be led again to the bath, and afterwards get warm\r\nwater to drink, the juice of ptisan, and sometimes of lettuce; and are to\r\npartake of fishes having tender flesh, in white broth. The common diet in\r\nall these cases ought to consist of things which contain good juices, of\r\neasy digestion, and which will not be restrained within the pores of the\r\nskin. Wine should be given which is watery in appearance and strength. It\r\nwill sometimes be proper, on the first attack of the fever, to give some\r\nnourishing food, when the fever has been enkindled by an intemperament\r\ninclining to the hot and dry. Those who have this fever from inflammation\r\nof the glands of the groin, do not require a physician to instruct them\r\nwhat ought to be done; for, attending to the ulcer from the time that the\r\nbubo is formed, they take the bath in the decline of the paroxysm. But\r\nthey ought to be restricted as to wine, until the inflammation of the\r\ngroin is resolved, and use a spare diet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Among all the remains of ancient medicine which have come\r\ndown to us, there is not, perhaps, anything more valuable than the\r\nreports of febrile diseases, contained in the ‘Epidemics’ of Hippocrates,\r\nillustrated, as they fortunately are, by the learned ‘Commentaries’ of\r\nGalen. Many of them are histories of ephemeral fevers, brought on by\r\ncertain exciting causes, and terminating in synochus. The procatarctic\r\ncauses generally assigned are fatigue, excessive debauchery, grief,\r\nexposure to extreme heat or cold, and the like.\r\n\r\nHippocrates thus defines the duty of the physician in conducting the\r\ntreatment of febrile diseases: To be able to tell what had preceded them;\r\nto know the present state and foretel the future; to have two objects in\r\nview, either to do good, or at least to do no harm. (Epidem. i, 7.) His\r\ngeneral rule with regard to regimen in fevers is most important, namely,\r\nthat a diluent or moistening diet is proper in all febrile affections.\r\n(Aphoris. i, 16.) See his Comment. (t. ii, p. 283, ed. Dietz.)\r\n\r\nOf no disease has Galen treated so frequently and fully as of fever. (See\r\nde Diff. Febrium, Meth. Med. viii and ix; Therap. ad Glauc., de Crisibus\r\nii, 13, et alibi.) He everywhere inculcates that ephemeral fevers are\r\naffections of the _spirits_, by which he seems to have understood the\r\nheat and gases contained in the blood. The exciting or remote causes of\r\nthem, according to him, are want of sleep, indigestion, sorrow, fear,\r\nanger, anxiety, the application of heat and cold, excessive fatigue,\r\ntumour of the groin, and the like. He remarks, that the heat in these\r\nfevers is not offensive on the first application of the fingers, but\r\nconveys an acrid sensation after a short time. He has particularly\r\nstated constriction as a proximate cause of fever; and this, by the\r\nway, is agreeable to what is stated by Cælius Aurelianus: “quidam vero\r\nconclusioni viarum causam febrium ascribentes.” (Acut. Morb. ii, 33.)\r\nIn this variety, he approves of venesection, unless the patient be a\r\nchild or a very old man. In the other cases, his most approved remedy\r\nis the bath; but his treatment is judiciously varied, according to\r\ncircumstances. For example, when the fever arises from the depressing\r\npassions, he forbids hard friction and frequent baths, and merely directs\r\nus to pour tepid oil over the patient’s body. When it is produced by\r\nexposure to heat, he forbids us to use much oil, or to have recourse\r\nto hard friction, and directs us to pour upon the head water which has\r\nbeen cooled by means of ice, and to put the patient into a cold bath.\r\nAlexander, however, finds fault with him for giving heating medicines,\r\nsuch as pepper, and using hot applications over the stomach in such\r\ncases. Alexander’s account of the nature and treatment of these fevers\r\ncannot be perused with too much attention. He mentions as characteristics\r\nof ephemerals, that the urine is properly concocted from the first;\r\nand that the pulses have a quick and elevated diastole, with a shorter\r\nsystole; the vessels, he adds, requiring refrigeration, rather than\r\npurification. They arise, he says, from many and various causes, such\r\nas repletion, want, watchfulness, fatigue, disorder of the belly,\r\napostemes; and, in a word, from all the procatarctic causes. When the\r\nfever is occasioned by excessive fatigue, the indication, he states,\r\nis to supply moisture to the body, rather than to take from it. Hence,\r\nall friction with discutient oils ought to be avoided; and what is used\r\nfor rubbing the body should be mixed with much water. But the principal\r\ndependence is to be put upon the tepid bath. Here, again, he thinks\r\nthat Galen erred, in not directing that the oil used for rubbing the\r\nbody should be diluted with water. He adds, that it will often have an\r\nexcellent effect after the patient has come out of the tepid bath, and\r\nbeen anointed as directed, to make him take a warm bath and remain in\r\nit for a considerable time. When ephemerals arise from indigestion, he\r\ngives very minute directions for the treatment, according to the nature\r\nof the exciting cause. When connected with constriction, he approves of\r\nbleeding, if, as generally happens, it be attended with fulness.\r\n\r\nOribasius and Aëtius treat of ephemeral fevers in much the same terms as\r\nour author.\r\n\r\nPalladius says that ephemerals are affections of the _spirits_, arising\r\nfrom some external exciting cause, such as fatigue, intoxication,\r\nanxiety, watchfulness, or from a tumour of the groin. Celsus gives a\r\nsimilar enumeration of the causes, but in briefer terms: “Febris ex\r\ninguine, vel ex lassitudine, vel ex æstu, aliâve simili re est.” Almost\r\nall the authorities, from Hippocrates downwards, mention enlargement of\r\nthe glands, especially those of the groin, among the causes of fever.\r\nAgathias, the historian, remarks, that pestilential fever is attended\r\nwith enlargement of the inguinal glands, but does not terminate favorably\r\nin one day, like the ephemerals. (Hist. v.) Stephanus, the commentator,\r\naccounts for the enlargement of the glands in fever, as being a\r\ncollection of the impurities of the system in its weakest points. (Ed.\r\nDietz, p. 244 and 256.)\r\n\r\nNonnius enumerates nearly the same causes of these fevers as our author,\r\nwhom he appears to have followed closely. He remarks, that ephemerals are\r\nsometimes protracted to the third or fourth day, from which it appears\r\nthat the term is not to be taken in too strict a sense. Leo, also,\r\nexpresses himself in like terms.\r\n\r\nSynesius treats of ephemeral fevers with great accuracy, so that we have\r\nreason to regret that the text of this author should be so corrupt. Like\r\npreceding authors, he enumerates, among the exciting causes, abscess\r\nof the glands of the groin, neck, and armpits, the heat of which, he\r\nsays, being determined to the heart, kindles a fever. In this case he\r\nrecommends discutient and emollient applications, such as mallows,\r\nlinseed, and the like. The account given by Constantinus Africanus is\r\nexactly similar to his.\r\n\r\nActuarius mentions the same causes, and briefly recommends the same\r\ntreatment as our author.\r\n\r\nAlexander Aphrodisiensis says expressly, that the ephemeral fever may\r\npass into the putrid and the putrid into the hectic. (De Febribus, 28.)\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas gives a most distinct and accurate account of the phenomena\r\nof ephemeral fevers, according to the nature of their remote causes. The\r\nfirst class are produced by external causes, such as exposure to the heat\r\nof the sun, hot baths, or astringents which occasion constriction of the\r\npores of the skin. He also inculcates that these causes may likewise\r\ngive rise to synochous or putrid fevers. The second class are produced\r\nby calefacient food and medicines. The third class are occasioned by\r\nimmoderate exercise, or violent passions, such as anger, fear, and the\r\nlike. The fourth are sympathetic affections proceeding from inflammatory\r\nswellings of the glands. He remarks, that in certain kinds of fever the\r\nincrease of heat is not felt upon the first application of the hand,\r\nowing to constriction of the pores. (Theor. viii, 3.) His treatment\r\nmerits attention. When the fever arises from a hot cause, he directs us\r\nto pour refrigerant liquids, such as vinegar, rose oil, and the like,\r\nupon the head, and to apply to the forehead a cloth moistened with the\r\nsame. When the fever is produced by cold, he recommends the warm bath,\r\nwith friction, in order to promote perspiration; after which calefacients\r\nmay be given; but he forbids wine, if the exciting cause be great, lest\r\nit should occasion a conversion of the complaint into a putrid fever,\r\nwhich, as he remarks, Galen states not to be an uncommon occurrence. To\r\nprevent this he recommends venesection and the liberal administration of\r\ndiluents. The next class of ephemerals of which he treats are intestinal\r\nfevers originating in errors of food and drink. For these he recommends\r\ncooling drink, cooling articles of food, clysters, eccoprotics, and the\r\nlike. When the fever is brought on by violent labour, he prescribes the\r\ntepid bath, gentle friction with emollient oils, light food, and a spare\r\nallowance of wine, provided the patient has been habituated to it. When\r\nthe fever is produced by violent emotions of the mind, he recommends the\r\ntepid bath, refrigerant food, camphor, and the like. When it arises from\r\nsorrow, he directs us to have recourse to treatment of an exhilarating\r\nnature, the bath, wine, and so forth. For fever brought on by want of\r\nsleep, he recommends soothing treatment, the affusion of tepid water and\r\nwine, if the patient has been accustomed to it. In fevers arising from\r\nglandular swellings, he approves of venesection, and forbids the use\r\nof the bath and of wine. This is somewhat different from our author’s\r\ntreatment. The account of the causes and treatment of ephemerals given\r\nby Alsaharavius is so like that of Haly Abbas, that we shall not enter\r\nparticularly upon it. Serapion, Averrhoes, and Avenzoar give sensible\r\nexpositions of the causes and cure of these fevers; but there is little\r\nin them worthy of attention that is not derived from the Greeks. Avenzoar\r\nstates distinctly, that, if neglected or mismanaged, they are apt to be\r\nconverted into putrid, or synochous fevers. For ephemerals occasioned\r\nby labour, he recommends the tepid bath, and friction with the pulp\r\nof melons. Avicenna remarks, that if, in ephemerals, the blood become\r\ninflamed, the fever is apt to be converted into synochous, or, if it\r\nbecome putrid, into putrid fever. This, he says, is particularly the\r\ncase, when the ephemeral fever is connected with obstruction of the pores\r\nof the skin. For the cure of this species, he approves of venesection.\r\nHe recommends the same remedy when the disease arises from drinking\r\ntoo much wine, or from aposteme of the groin, armpits, or neck. His\r\nexpositor Syrasis particularly commends the tepid affusion in ephemerals.\r\nRhases joins in enforcing the same practice as Avicenna. He gives a\r\nmost comprehensive account of the causes of these fevers. Like all the\r\nother authorities, he decidedly inculcates this important fact, that,\r\nalthough ephemeral fever be in itself neither serious nor fatal, it may\r\nbe converted into a vehement and acute fever, when any error is committed\r\nin the regimen or method of cure. Constriction, he says, may take place,\r\neither in the pores of the skin, or in the internal parts, and is\r\ngenerally occasioned by cold or astringents. This is one of the causes of\r\nfever. The others are, immoderate exercise, the application of heat, food\r\nof a heating nature, and putridity.\r\n\r\nAccording to Prosper Alpinus, the Methodists held that the proximate\r\ncause of fever is constriction. Galen, as we have stated, held this to be\r\none of the causes, but not the sole one. The Methodists, like our Cullen\r\nand Hoffman, seem to have generalized too much. Their most approved\r\nremedies were the warm bath and friction with emollient oils. (De Med.\r\nMethod. v.)\r\n\r\nThe earlier modern writers on medicine give the same account of\r\nephemerals as their ancient masters, whose views in all cases they\r\nservilely adopt. See Rogerius (Tract. iii), and Platearius (de Febribus.)\r\nRogerius correctly remarks, that ephemeral fever, from enlargement of the\r\nglands, is merely symptomatic. The causes of ephemerals, as enumerated\r\nby him, are exposure to extremes of heat and cold, food and drink of a\r\nheating nature, strong exercise, violent passions of the mind, and the\r\nlike. Platearius remarks that if an ephemeral be prolonged beyond the\r\nthird or fourth day, it is apt to be converted into a putrid fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XVII.—ON DIAGNOSIS OF FEVERS FROM PUTREFACTION.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of fevers from putrefaction is formed from observing that\r\nnone of the procatarctic or exciting causes had preceded; and it is\r\npeculiar to fevers from putrefaction, that they do not commence with\r\nrigors, and have not been preceded neither by strong heat or cold; and\r\ncompression of the pulse is also peculiar to them. This is the name\r\ngiven to the pulse, when in the commencement of the paroxysm it is very\r\nsmall and irregular. This is a well-marked peculiarity of such fevers.\r\nBut the strongest characteristic of putrid fevers is, the quality of the\r\nheat; for it is fuliginous so as to prove pungent to the touch. Want of\r\nconcoction in the urine and feeble digestion are also peculiar to them;\r\nfor, in such fevers, a strong and distinguished appearance of concoction\r\nin the urine is never to be seen at first.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is mostly taken from Oribasius (Synops. vi,\r\n7.) Many of the histories in the Epidemics of Hippocrates are synochous\r\nfevers, accompanied with putrefaction of the fluids. Galen remarks that\r\nthey occur principally in persons of a plethoric and gross habit of body.\r\n(Meth. Med. viii.) According to him, putrid fevers may either arise\r\nfrom the conversion of ephemerals, or originally from putrefaction of\r\nthe fluids within the vessels. (De Diff. Feb. i, 9.) Aëtius states that\r\nthey arise from constriction of the skin, or viscidity of the humours,\r\nwhereby the perspiration is stopped, and the quality of the vital heat\r\nso altered as to give rise to putrefaction, first of the fluids, and\r\nafterwards of the fat and solid parts. When these corrupted fluids are\r\ncontained within the vessels, they occasion synochous fevers; but, when\r\ndistributed over the body, they give rise to intermittents. (v, 74.)\r\nSynesius and Constantinus Africanus give a similar account. Alexander\r\ngives an interesting and ingenious disquisition on the origin and nature\r\nof putrid fevers, one of the most common causes of which he holds to be\r\nthe conversion of ephemeral fevers, and the inseparable symptoms being\r\nwant of concoction in the urine and quickness of the pulse with systole.\r\nThis is the account of them given by most of the other authorities, both\r\nGreek and Arabian, so that we need not enter into any very circumstantial\r\nexposition of their views. We shall merely give the brief account of\r\nthem furnished by Palladius. There are, he says, two kinds of synochous\r\nfevers, the one being occasioned by effervescence, and the other by\r\nputrefaction of the blood; of these, the latter are the more protracted\r\nand dangerous. In them the pulse is contracted, the heat pungent, and\r\nthe urine white and putrid. Among the Arabians, see, in particular,\r\nAlsaharavius (xxxii, 6); Haly Abbas (Theor. viii, 5); and Rhases (Cont.\r\nxxx.) Rhases states that putrid fevers are often engendered by eating too\r\nmuch fruit, such as peaches. He says they generally begin with depression\r\nof the pulse, horripilation, torpor, and somnolency.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XVIII.—THE CURE OF PUTRID FEVERS.\r\n\r\nWhen the powers of the constitution are strong, a person affected with\r\na putrid fever ought to be bled in the commencement, provided there be\r\nno crudities in the stomach. But when the powers are weak, or the age of\r\nthe patient is an objection, you must not bleed. After the evacuation by\r\nbleeding, it will be proper to clear away the putrid matters by urine,\r\nthe belly, and sweating. And, if they have spontaneously been determined\r\ntowards the mouth of the stomach, they may be evacuated by emetics, but\r\notherwise you must not produce an unnatural irritation. Such things\r\nought also to be selected as will effect the afore-mentioned evacuations\r\nwithout heating or drying, such as the juice of ptisan, honied water,\r\noxymel, apomel, and the root of parsley. When the belly is not opened,\r\nan injection of mulse, with oil, may be given. The body is not to be\r\nrarefied before evacuations; but, after evacuations, it may be rarefied\r\nby means of an oil possessing a gentle heat, such as that of chamomile.\r\nAt this season, all the secretions are promoted by drinking of some\r\nwatery wine, and using a tepid bath of sweet water. When the strength\r\nof the fever is an objection, you must neither use wine, the bath, nor\r\nrarefying unctions; but, in such cases, drinking of cold water is the\r\nmost suitable remedy, if nothing prevent the use of it likewise. But if\r\nall the powers are strong, the fever of a very hot nature, with clear\r\nsymptoms of concoction, cold water may be given boldly. But if he is\r\nmuscular, and the constitution of the air hot and dry, he will not be\r\nhurt by being thrown into a cold bath. And if the fever is moderate,\r\nand the strength good, with symptoms of concoction, baths, the drinking\r\nof wine, and unctions of a rarefying nature will be beneficial to such\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. All subsequent writers on this subject are indebted to\r\nGalen for laying down, in the most satisfactory terms, the principles\r\nupon which the treatment of putrid fevers ought to be conducted. He\r\nparticularly recommends bleeding _ad deliquium_. When this evacuation\r\nis neglected, the patient’s only chance of safety is from a spontaneous\r\nhemorrhage or profuse perspiration. He is so confident in the remedial\r\npowers of venesection, that he directs it to be performed as late as the\r\nseventh day, and even later, if the strength of the patient permit. He\r\nparticularly directs us likewise to allow the patient to drink as much\r\nas he chooses of the coldest water, which, he says, when seasonably\r\nadministered, is most efficacious in extinguishing the febrile heat.\r\nThis remedy, however, he says, is to be used with becoming caution. But,\r\nupon the whole, he strenuously inculcates that the safety of the patient\r\ndepends upon the free use of phlebotomy and cold drink. When the fever\r\nabates, he allows wine. Alexander, although sufficiently disposed to\r\ndiffer from Galen, entirely concurs with him in opinion respecting the\r\ntreatment of putrid fevers, for which he particularly commends bleeding\r\nand cold drink. When venesection is contraindicated by the weakness of\r\nthe patient, he is to be treated by a refrigerant and diluent regimen.\r\n\r\nAëtius and Oribasius follow Galen, and their treatment, therefore, agrees\r\nperfectly with our author’s. Synesius and Constantinus Africanus agree in\r\nrecommending bleeding and cold drink. But when the patient is very weak,\r\nthey forbid us to have recourse to the former, and, in that case, direct\r\nus to use gentle aperients, and medicines of a refrigerant and diluent\r\nnature, such as prunes, jujubes, purslain, and the like.\r\n\r\nAlthough Avicenna lays little claim to originality, his plan of treatment\r\nin this case is deserving of attention, as being directed by the soundest\r\njudgment. He begins with venesection, if the patient’s strength permit,\r\nand then opens the belly gently, but cautions against violent purging. He\r\nthen gives first diuretics, and afterwards sudorifics. Unless when the\r\nstomach is loaded with crudities, he approves very much of cold drink.\r\nThough favorable to the seasonable practice of venesection, he forbids\r\nit except at the commencement; and directs to proportion the loss of\r\nblood to the strength of the patient. He also forbids interference with\r\nthe crisis by bleeding, purging, or giving gross food at that season.\r\nFurther, with regard to venesection, he does not approve of abstracting\r\nmuch blood at once, which may occasion a dangerous prostration of\r\nstrength; but prefers taking a moderate quantity, and repeating the\r\noperation, if necessary. The purgatives which he most commends are\r\ntamarinds and myrobalans; but when these are not sufficiently strong, he\r\npermits scammony, aloes, and colocynth to be given. He also directs us to\r\ngive camphor as a refrigerant. It is to be kept in mind that the Arabians\r\nheld the action of camphor to be frigorific, that is to say, narcotic.\r\nHe is most minute in his directions about the diet. For drink, he gives\r\nbarley-water, with a small proportion of wine or vinegar.\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas lays down the rules of treatment with great precision. He\r\nrecommends venesection at the commencement, provided the fever be of a\r\nsanguineous type; but, if the patient be debilitated, he is to be treated\r\nwith refrigerants.\r\n\r\nAverrhoes treats of putrid fevers at great length, and with more than his\r\nusual judgment; but, as he differs but little from Avicenna, we shall not\r\nattempt to give an abstract of his practice. (Collig. vii, 9.) Rhases\r\ngives a full account of the practice of the Greeks. When the extremities\r\nare cold, and the pulse weak, he directs them to be rubbed, in order to\r\ndraw off the blood from the internal parts.\r\n\r\nAlexander Aphrodisiensis inquires how it happens that wine, which is of a\r\nhot nature, proves useful in fever. The amount of his speculations upon\r\nthis matter is this, that the wine acts by strengthening the powers of\r\nthe system. (Probl.)\r\n\r\nAll the ancient authorities disapprove of the bath, except in the decline\r\nof the fever. See Ugulinus (de Balneis.) Rabbi Moyses says that the use\r\nof it is to be regulated by three circumstances: 1st. That no rigor be\r\npresent. 2d. That no important member be affected. 3d. That there be no\r\ncrudities in the veins. These appear to be very judicious regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XIX.—THE DIAGNOSIS OF TERTIAN FEVERS.\r\n\r\nThe tertian fever being occasioned by yellow bile set in agitation, has\r\na considerable rigor in the beginning, which differs, however, from the\r\nrigor of a quartan in this, that the skin feels as if it were pierced\r\nand wounded; but, in quartans, the attack is accompanied with a strong\r\nchill; and quotidians have no preceding rigor, they are only accompanied\r\nwith a chill. But in tertians, the order of the pulse is regular, and the\r\nfever is attended with strong thirst towards the acme, and burns up the\r\nman; but shortly afterwards the acme takes place, and the heat is equally\r\ndiffused everywhere. If you apply your hand, at first it is met by a\r\nstrong and pungent heat, which seems as if carried upwards in the form\r\nof vapour, but it is soon extinguished under the hand, if it is allowed\r\nto remain. And when the person drinks, a hot vapour in great quantity\r\nimmediately issues from the skin, announcing sweat. But vomiting of bile\r\nsupervenes, or the belly is purged, and bilious urine is passed. With\r\nthese the fever goes off, having comprehended not more than twelve hours\r\nin one paroxysm. When, therefore, it abates within twelve hours, we call\r\nit true tertian; when the paroxysm is more protracted, we name it simply\r\ntertian; and when the paroxysm is prolonged to the utmost, so as to have\r\nbut a small interval, we call it prolonged tertian.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates relates many interesting cases of tertian fevers\r\nin his ‘Epidemics.’ He attributes their origin to bile. (De Nat. Hum. 29.)\r\n\r\nCelsus describes two kinds of the tertian, the one beginning with\r\nshivering, and being succeeded by heat, the paroxysm returning every\r\nalternate day; and the other constituting the semi-tertian, of which we\r\nwill have to treat afterwards.\r\n\r\nGalen treats of these fevers in different parts of his works. (In\r\nHippocrat. Epidem. Comment., Therap. ad Glauc., de Different. Feb. ii,\r\n3, de Typis, 3.) The symptoms of the tertian are thus described by him:\r\nIt is attended with intense thirst, heat, acrid and bilious vomitings,\r\nloss of appetite, and restlessness. For the most part these symptoms\r\nare preceded by rigors, or sometimes by extreme coldness. The pulse in\r\ntertians is small and dense. At first, the night preceding an attack\r\nis passed in a restless state, but after the disease is prolonged this\r\nis not the case. The urine is yellow. In many parts of his works he\r\nannounces it as his decided opinion that the quotidian intermittent is\r\nproduced by phlegm; the tertian by yellow bile; and the quartan by black\r\nbile. This theory of intermittents was adopted, in a word, by all his\r\nsuccessors. See Oribasius (Synops. vi, 9); Aëtius (v, 80); Nonnus (de\r\nFebr. 6); Palladius (de Febr. 6); Alexander (xii, 6); Synesius (iii);\r\nAvicenna (iv, 1, 2); Haly Abbas (Theor. viii); Serapion (vi, 13);\r\nAvenzoar (iii, 1, 2); Averrhoes (Collig. iv, 28.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XX.—ON THE CURE OF TERTIAN FEVER.\r\n\r\nIn the true tertian, as arising from yellow bile, we must dilute and\r\ncool, evacuate the defluxions upon the stomach by emetics, and downwards\r\nby the belly, and carry them off by urine and perspiration. The bowels,\r\ntherefore, are to be moved by emollient clysters, and the secretion of\r\nmine promoted by infusions of parsley and dill in the drinks. And if\r\nsymptoms of concoction appear, you may confidently give wormwood. Apply\r\nalso baths of warm common water, and let neither nitre, nor salts, nor\r\nmustard be sprinkled upon the body in the bath; but let the patient\r\nenter it after having had warm oil poured over his body. There will\r\nbe no mistake if those who are fond of baths be bathed twice; and, if\r\nsymptoms of the diseases being concocted appear, there will be no harm\r\neven if they be bathed oftener. Until the disease is concocted, wine is\r\nto be entirely prohibited; but when concoction commences, first some thin\r\nand watery wine may be given, and food of a diluent and cooling nature\r\nwill be proper; but honey, mustard, pickles, and everything heating must\r\nbe abstained from. Such was the practice of the ancients; nor is it to\r\nbe wondered at, as these men were more habituated to exercises and a\r\nrestricted diet; but now, when order is perverted, the bile is, for the\r\nmost part, found mixed with phlegm. Wherefore, now-a-days, most tertians\r\nare either without a rigor, or it is very slight. And the mode of cure is\r\nalso changed; for, neither does the bath suit with tertians now before\r\nconcoction, nor yet a full diet, except crumbs of bread, eggs, or the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates recommends generally purgatives at the\r\ncommencement, and afterwards the hot bath, and trefoil, assafœtida, and\r\nwine, to promote perspiration. (De Morbis, ii, 39.) He lays it down as a\r\ngeneral rule applicable to all intermittent and remittent fevers, that\r\nthe administration of food should be restricted during the paroxyms.\r\n(Aphor.) See the Comment of Theophilus (ed. Dietz, t. ii, 268.)\r\n\r\nCelsus informs us that Cleophantus treated tertians by pouring warm water\r\nupon the patient’s head, and giving him wine before the accession of a\r\nparoxysm. This, however, he considers to be precarious practice. Upon\r\nthe whole, his great dependence is upon these three remedies: vomits,\r\npurgatives, and wine; of which the first is to be tried on the third day,\r\nthe second on the fifth, the third on the seventh.\r\n\r\nGalen’s practice is exactly detailed by our author. He evacuates the\r\nbile upwards and downwards at the commencement, and also, with the same\r\nintention, administers diuretics and sudorifics. After these he reposes\r\ngreat confidence in wormwood, which, indeed, all the ancients held to\r\nbe a powerful cholagogue. He also approves much of the tepid bath of\r\ncommon water. He directs the physician not to neglect venesection, if\r\nit be indicated; upon which his commentator Stephanus remarks, that the\r\ncircumstances commonly indicating bloodletting are the condition of the\r\npatient, if he be young and plethoric, and the season of the year, if it\r\nbe spring. (Ed. Dietz.) He forbids wine until the fever is concocted, but\r\nafterwards allows a small quantity of thin watery wine. The food is to be\r\nrefrigerant, and diluent. Everything of a heating and acrid nature is to\r\nbe abstained from.\r\n\r\nAëtius, Oribasius, and Nonnus conduct the treatment upon the principles\r\nlaid down by Galen. Actuarius directs bleeding at the commencement.\r\n\r\nAlexander discusses the established principles of treatment freely and\r\nfully. He disapproves of Galen’s practice of giving the decoction of\r\nwormwood in the genuine or true tertian, after the seventh day, and\r\nconfines the administration of it to spurious tertians, when he mixes it\r\nwith oxymel. His own remedies are of a diluent and refrigerant nature. He\r\napproves very much of the bath. He speaks highly of the good effects of\r\ngrapes and peaches, and still more of water-melons given with cold water\r\nbefore the fit. He approves of gentle, but not of strong purgatives. He\r\npraises very especially a rhodomel prepared from the juice of roses,\r\nhoney, and scammony; and another, consisting of the same ingredients,\r\nalong with agaric and pepper.\r\n\r\nSynesius recommends cooling articles, such as damascenes, gourds, &c.\r\nbut says nothing of wormwood. Constantinus Africanus also omits to make\r\nmention either of wormwood or the tepid bath. He, however, pours water on\r\nthe head and puts the feet into hot water.\r\n\r\nSerapion directs emetics, if the matters are determined to the stomach,\r\nand clysters, or gentle purgatives, if to the bowels. He recommends\r\nmyrobalans afterwards, and then wormwood, but not until the morbific\r\nmatter is concocted. (Tr. vii, 13.)\r\n\r\nRhases recommends gentle and cooling purgatives, with refrigerant and\r\ndiluent drinks, containing sorrel, cucumber, camphor, &c. (Ad Mansor. x,\r\n4.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna’s directions are exceedingly minute, and seemingly very\r\njudicious. He cautions against using drastic purgatives, and expresses\r\nhimself doubtfully of the effect of venesection. His practice consists\r\nprincipally in the administration of gentle purgatives, diluent\r\nand refrigerant medicines. He approves of pomegranates, plums, and\r\nwater-melons. Averrhoes lays down the same principles of practice.\r\n(Collig. vii, 11.) Haly Abbas states that, as it is the nature of these\r\nfevers to occasion heat and dryness of the body, they are to be treated\r\nwith diluents and refrigerants. Agreeably to these principles, he directs\r\nus to give clysters and gentle laxatives, to use the tepid affusion, and\r\nthe like. (Pract. iii, 12.) Alsaharavius recommends similar treatment.\r\nRhases, like Haly, recommends refrigerants and diluents. He approves of\r\ncooling purgatives, such as a combination of myrobalans and scammony, or\r\na draught made from prunes and manna. He speaks favorably of emetics.\r\nSeveral of his authorities recommend the bath, and others approve of\r\nwormwood. (Contin. xxx.)\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked that many of the ancient authorities recommend the\r\ntepid bath for the cure of tertian intermittents. Prosper Alpinus informs\r\nus that he had seen this practice successfully pursued by the Egyptian\r\nphysicians. (De Med. Ægypt.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXI.—THE CURE OF SPURIOUS TERTIANS.\r\n\r\nIt does not suit with spurious tertians to bathe at the commencement,\r\nnor until symptoms of concoction have made their appearance. Neither\r\ndoes it answer to give food every day, but every alternate day will\r\nbe sufficient. Rest and warm applications to the hypochondriac region\r\nagree with them, also broths of easy digestion, and clysters not very\r\nemollient. And if detraction of blood be expedient, it ought by no means\r\nto be omitted. The nature of the diet ought not upon the whole to be\r\ncooling and diluent, but things of a more incisive nature ought to be\r\nadded. They are particularly benefited by the juice of ptisan, to which\r\nhave been added pepper, hyssop, sweet marjoram, and spikenard. Also,\r\nadd pepper to honied water, boil, and give it to drink, and likewise\r\neverything which will promote the secretion of urine, except those things\r\nwhich are of a very heating and desiccant nature. In particular, after\r\nthe seventh day, give wormwood; and many have been benefited by drinking\r\noxymel, and taking gentle laxatives. A vomit taken with food is very\r\nbeneficial to those in whom the affection is of long continuance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen explains that tertians are called spurious or bastard,\r\nwhen the symptoms assume an anomalous character. He states correctly\r\nthat they are generally connected with disease of the spleen. His\r\npractice, which is consistent with his views of the nature of the attack,\r\nis similar to our author’s, that is to say, he recommends venesection\r\nand fomentations at the commencement, and afterwards things of a hot\r\npenetrating nature, such as wormwood and pepper, which he, no doubt,\r\ngave with the intention that they should act as deobstruents. Here,\r\nagain, Alexander cautions against the indiscriminate adoption of Galen’s\r\npractice, affirming that these calefacient medicines sometimes prove\r\ndangerous, by increasing the inflammatory action. Almost all the other\r\nauthorities, however, adopt the views of Galen. See, in particular,\r\nOribasius (Synops. vi, 11); Aëtius (v, 81); Nonnus (de Febribus, c. v.)\r\nFrom the characters of the urine Actuarius infers that the spurious\r\ntertians are still more intensely bilious than the true, and consequently\r\nrequire longer time to reach their acme. (De Urinis, v, 15.) Avicenna\r\nrecommends at first venesection and clysters; and afterwards deobstruent\r\nmedicines, such as wormwood and pepper. Haly Abbas treats spurious\r\ntertians like true, at the commencement. After their acme, he strongly\r\nrecommends wormwood, but forbids it earlier. It acts, he says, by\r\nincreasing the strength of the stomach, opening the pores, increasing the\r\nurine, and promoting the secretion of bile. He approves of wine in the\r\ndecline of the fever, with the view of supporting the strength, and of\r\npromoting the urinary and cutaneous secretions. He therefore directs that\r\nthe wine be white, and not too old. (Pract. iii, 13.)\r\n\r\nFrom the account of the ancient practice in cases of tertians, as\r\ngiven in this and the preceding chapter, it will be seen that the\r\nuse of bitters in these diseases was well understood formerly. The\r\nadministration of pepper in such cases, it will also be remarked, was an\r\nancient practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXII.—THE DIAGNOSIS OF QUARTANS.\r\n\r\nThe quartan makes its attack with much coldness, as having its origin\r\nfrom a cold humour, namely, the black bile; but it is not attended with\r\nardour and febrile heat like the tertian, neither does a vomiting of\r\nbile accompany. If, in addition to these, the urine be thin, white, and\r\nwatery, the fever certainly is a quartan; but the characteristic of a\r\ntrue quartan is a small and rare pulse. They have their beginning most\r\nfrequently in autumn, supervening upon wandering fevers. At that season,\r\nintermittents generally assume the quartan type, although sometimes the\r\nparoxysm observes a longer interval of days.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We mentioned, in the 18th Section, that the ancients held\r\nquartans to be occasioned by an accumulation of black bile. Hence, says\r\nHippocrates, they prevail most in autumn, and attack persons between the\r\nages of twenty-five and forty-five. (De Nat. Hum. 29.) He recommends\r\nprincipally for them emetics, purgatives, and the warm bath. (De Affect.\r\n19.) By wandering fevers, of which mention is made by our author, is\r\nmeant fevers, the paroxysms of which return after an interval of many\r\ndays. See Hippocr. (Epidem.); Rhases (ad Mansor. x, 8.)\r\n\r\nOur author’s description is condensed from Galen (Therap. ad Glauc. i),\r\nor probably copied direct from Oribasius (Synops. vi, 12.) Galen states\r\nthat quartans are of a less inflammatory nature than tertians, and hence\r\nthe pulse is slower and smaller. Ruffus (ap. Aëtium, v, 83) refers the\r\norigin of certain quartans to the spleen. Alexander says that quartans\r\narise from yellow bile overheated, or from feculent blood, these humours\r\nbeing lodged either in the vessels or in the spleen. Palladius, Nonnus,\r\nSynesius, and, in a word, all the Greek authorities, give a similar\r\naccount of the nature of quartans. Constantinus Africanus says that a\r\nparoxysm lasts for twenty-four hours, and is succeeded by an interval of\r\nforty-eight hours. The urine is at first white and watery, but in the\r\ndecline becomes black. He mentions that it is connected with induration\r\nof the spleen. Actuarius gives a similar account of the nature of the\r\ndisease, and of the characters of the urine. The disease, he says, is\r\ngenerally connected with some affection of the liver or spleen, and\r\npasses off by a discharge of black urine. He relates an interesting case\r\nto this effect. (De Urinis, ii, 17.) It may be proper to mention that in\r\nall other acute diseases, a discharge of black urine was reckoned a very\r\nmortal symptom. (De Urinis Comment. ed. Ideler.)\r\n\r\nAs there is nothing original in the theory and descriptions which the\r\nArabians give of quartans, we shall not enter upon them minutely.\r\nAverrhoes states that the fever invades with a great sense of cold,\r\nso that the patient’s teeth chatter. The colour of the urine at first\r\ninclines to green, or is somewhat white; but afterwards it becomes gross,\r\nblack, or reddish. The interval between the paroxysms is two days.\r\nThe most of those affected with quartans have disease of the spleen.\r\nAlsaharavius gives exactly the same account of these fevers. Avicenna’s\r\ndescription is most ample and comprehensive, but contains no additional\r\nfacts to those we have already mentioned. Haly Abbas, Avenzoar, and\r\nRhases, in like manner, adopt the views of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXIII.—THE CURE OF QUARTANS.\r\n\r\nThose affected with quartans are to be treated gently, without any\r\npowerful medicine or evacuation, unless a great fulness of blood prevail,\r\nin which case it may be necessary to bleed. The diet should be good\r\nand not flatulent, and the belly ought to be loosened by the customary\r\nthings; and, if these are not sufficient, clysters may be used, at first\r\nemollient, and afterwards acrid. They must be prohibited from swine’s\r\nflesh, and everything that is viscid and slowly evacuated, and also from\r\nall cooling and diluent articles of food. Let them use a thin white wine\r\nmoderately warm, also pickles and mustard. And after an interval of some\r\ndays, they should take the composition consisting of three peppers, or\r\nthat called Diospoliticus. And if they take every day of pepper alone\r\nin water, they will do well. But if the patient is at the acme of the\r\ncomplaint, his diet ought to be very light, he should be enjoined to\r\ntake protracted rest, and to take care of his bowels by using emollient\r\nand laxative things. Next, let him use diuretics; and if the symptoms of\r\nconcoction appear manifest, then he may boldly have recourse to such as\r\nevacuate black humours, and that not once only, but frequently. After a\r\npowerful evacuation give also the medicine from vipers, and such others\r\nas are recommended for these fevers, among which is the well-known and\r\nmost celebrated of all containing the Cyrenaic juice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is copied from Oribasius (Synops. vi, 13.)\r\nGalen, however, is the great authority upon this subject. With respect to\r\nvenesection, he directs us to have recourse to it only when there is a\r\nplethora of blood; but recommends, when a vein has been opened, and the\r\nblood found to be black and thick, especially in the case of diseased\r\nspleen, to abstract blood until it change its colour. He approves of\r\nlaxatives, and clysters, at first emollient and afterwards acrid. He\r\nforbids those things which were supposed to engender black bile, and\r\nrecommends a thin white wine. He speaks favorably of pepper. When the\r\ndisease is come to its acme, he recommends the state of the viscera\r\nto be rectified by fomentations and cataplasms, and by administering\r\nmelanogogues, especially hellebore, in such quantity as to operate\r\npowerfully upwards and downwards. He speaks favorably of vipers, and also\r\nof assafœtida. (Therap. ad Glauc. i.) The Commentary of Stephanus on this\r\nwork, lately published by Dietz, contains very sensible remarks on the\r\npractice here recommended.\r\n\r\nAlexander delivers his opinions regarding the treatment of quartans at\r\nso great a length that it is impossible to do justice to them in an\r\nabridgment. As usual, he animadverts freely upon the doctrines of Galen,\r\nwhom he finds fault with for recommending desiccants and calefacients in\r\nevery species of quartan fever; whereas he maintains that when it arises\r\nfrom adust bile, refrigerants are indicated. He strongly commends emetics\r\nat the beginning of a paroxysm. He approves of peppers combined with\r\nopium, henbane, and other articles. Synesius and Constantinus Africanus\r\nadmit the distinction made by Alexander, and nearly follow his principles\r\nof treatment. Synesius makes mention of wormwood, which, however,\r\nhad been recommended by Ruffus. (Ap. Aëtium.) Serenus Samonicus also\r\nrecommends wormwood: “Mira est absinthi cum simplice potio lympha.”\r\n\r\nCelsus gives minute directions for conducting the treatment in all\r\nthe stages of the complaint. He thus sums up the remedies which he\r\nrecommends: “In ejusmodi valetudine medicamenta sunt, oleum, frictio,\r\nexercitatio, cibus, vinum.”\r\n\r\nSerapion mentions black hellebore, agaric, and the lapis lazuli, as\r\nmedicines which purge black bile. (De Antid. vi, 15.) Averrhoes, however,\r\ncautions against using black hellebore for the cure of quartans;\r\nexpresses himself in dubious terms respecting venesection; and, upon the\r\nwhole, seems to place his principal reliance in things of a diffusible,\r\nattenuant, and penetrating nature. Haly Abbas, Avicenna, and Rhases\r\nspeak of venesection in much the same terms as Galen, that is to say,\r\nthey recommend it when symptoms of plethora are present, but say that\r\nit may prove prejudicial in any other circumstances. They approve of\r\nemetics at the commencement, and of wormwood in the decline of the fever.\r\nAvicenna appeals to Galen in favour of the black and white hellebore.\r\nSeveral of Rhases’ authorities in his ‘Continens’ recommend bleeding.\r\nThey in general approve of the early use of the bath, and of diuretics\r\nand sudorifics; and recommend, in the decline of the fever, things of a\r\nheating nature, such as pepper, anise, spikenard, ginger, &c.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be mentioned that _amulets_ were very much used in ancient\r\ntimes for the cure of quartans. Alexander Trallian had great confidence\r\nin them. Galen supposed that they owed their virtues to the physical\r\nproperties of the substances which were appended. Ælius Spartianus, one\r\nof the writers of the Augustan History, says, that the emperor Caracalla\r\nwished to punish those who made use of amulets. On the περίαπτα,\r\nπερίαμματα, vel amuleta of the ancients, see Andreas Laurentius (de\r\nMirab. Strum. sanat. p. 83); Rendtorfius (Notæ in Anatolii Fragment. ap.\r\nFabricii Biblioth. Græc. iv, 305); and Wolfius (ap. Act. Lips. 1690.) The\r\npractice of using amulets for the cure of diseases must have been very\r\nancient, for it is alluded to by Pindar (Pyth. iii), and Theophrastus (H.\r\nP. ix, 10.) The facts recently stated in support of the system of Animal\r\nMagnetism have been supposed to give some countenance to the ancient\r\nbelief in the efficacy of amulets.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXIV.—THE DIAGNOSIS OF THE QUOTIDIAN.\r\n\r\nThe quotidian does not make its attack with a rigor on the first day, but\r\nin progress of time, a chill rather than rigor takes place, which is,\r\nwith difficulty, succeeded by heat, and it has a protracted increase.\r\nYet, it does not make those affected hot, nor their respiration frequent\r\nand thick, nor does it make them pant or drink cold water. But they have\r\nvomitings of phlegm, and whatever is voided by the belly is cold, crude,\r\nand watery, in these fevers. And they have no sweats during the first\r\ndays, neither have they an interval of freedom from fever. Their colour\r\nis white and pale; their urine thin and white, or thick, turbid, and red.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have stated, in the 18th Section, that the ancients were\r\nof opinion that quotidians derive their origin from phlegm, that is to\r\nsay, serum.\r\n\r\nOur author’s description is abridged from Galen (Therap. ad Glauc. i.)\r\nThe other authorities treat of it in much the same terms. Even Alexander,\r\nwho aims at originality, agrees with Galen and Hippocrates, in referring\r\nthe origin of quotidians to phlegm. Palladius, in his valuable little\r\ntreatise on Fever, is at great pains to explain the manner in which\r\nputrid extravasated phlegm gives rise to quotidian. He represents the\r\nheat as being smothered and concealed like that of moist fuel. Celsus\r\ndescribes all the varieties of the disease very minutely. Constantinus\r\nAfricanus gives an accurate description of this intermittent. He says\r\nthat the paroxysm lasts for twenty-four (eighteen?) hours, and is\r\nfollowed by an interval of six hours. First, old persons, and then boys,\r\nare said to be peculiarly subject to the disease, which is apt to make\r\nits attack in cold countries and at cold seasons of the year. It is\r\nattended with a great degree of cold, especially of the extremities; the\r\nface is swelled, the colour pale, and no thirst is present.\r\n\r\nAs the Arabians give the same account of the origin and symptoms of\r\nquotidians, we need not enter upon a detail of their descriptions. All\r\nagree that they are connected with phlegm as an exciting cause, and that\r\nthe fever is less ardent and well-marked than in the case of tertians.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXV.—THE CURE OF QUOTIDIANS.\r\n\r\nIn curing the quotidian, we use oxymel during the first days, and those\r\nthings which properly promote the discharge of urine. And, upon the\r\nwhole, the diet ought to be incisive; but, at its acme, we must look to\r\nthe stomach, particularly its orifice. We must also prescribe an emetic\r\nfrom radishes taken with food, and phlegmagogue cathartics in abundance,\r\nuntil it subside.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius (Synops. vi, 14.)\r\n\r\nCelsus enjoins abstinence for three days; after which food is to be taken\r\nevery alternate day. After the fever has subsided, he recommends the bath\r\nand wine.\r\n\r\nGalen’s treatment is exactly the same as our author’s. Alexander, as\r\nusual, makes nice distinctions as to the circumstances under which each\r\nof the remedies ought to be applied. In general, he approves of incisive\r\nand attenuant medicines, but blames Galen for recommending the latter\r\ntoo indiscriminately. He forbids cataplasms and embrocations at the\r\ncommencement, lest they should occasion a determination of the humours to\r\nthe affected part.\r\n\r\nSynesius appears to have proceeded upon much the same principles as\r\nour author, but he makes mention of some additional medicines, such as\r\ncamphor, wormwood, and the like.\r\n\r\nNonnus recommends, at first, things of an incisive and attenuant nature,\r\nand then emetics, after which the phlegm is to be purged by means of\r\ncolocynth and agaric, and cataplasms and fomentations are to be applied\r\nto the pit of the stomach.\r\n\r\nAvicenna lays down the rules of treatment with so great minuteness, that\r\nwe cannot venture upon an abridgment of them. His principles, however,\r\nseem to be the same as those of Galen. Averrhoes recommends, for the\r\nfirst seven days, medicines of an incisive, attenuant, and deobstruent\r\nnature. He then gives cathartics which evacuate phlegm, such as turbith,\r\nagaric, and hiera picra, but forbids the use of colocynth. He approves\r\nvery much of friction, the mode of applying which is minutely described\r\nby him. Rhases recommends much the same treatment. He, in particular,\r\nrecommends turbith and agaric along with wormwood and mastich. Haly’s\r\nremedies are mostly diluents and attenuants. Alsaharavius recommends the\r\nsame remedies as Rhases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXVI.—ON THE FEVER HEPIALUS, AND THE RIGOR WITHOUT HEAT.\r\n\r\nThe vitreous phlegm being the coldest of all, if it accumulate in the\r\nbody, and remain free from putrefaction, it occasions the rigor without\r\nheat, which is not attended with fever. In those fevers which are kindled\r\nby the humours, it is putrefaction for the most part which kindles\r\nfebrile heat. If it become putrid, and that through its whole substance,\r\nwhich is rarely the case, owing to its great coldness, it occasions\r\nquotidian fever. But when it is half putrid, and not equally through its\r\nwhole substance, but some parts of it being putrid, and others not, it\r\ngives rise to the fever called hepialus, in which those affected have\r\nrigors and fever at the same time; for the parts of the humour which are\r\nnot putrid being scattered through the veins all over the body, occasion\r\nrigor; but the putrid parts kindle fever. The word hepialus is either\r\nderived from ἡπίας ἁλος, i. e. the sea, which is mild in appearance,\r\nalthough formidable in reality; or from ἡπίως ἁλεάζειν, i. e. warming\r\ngently. And, as this fever is of the quotidian kind, being formed by\r\nphlegm, it is to be treated in the same manner; only that it requires\r\nremedies as much hotter and more incisive than the quotidian, as its\r\nphlegm is colder than that of the other. The rigor without heat stands\r\nin need of heating things still more than the hepialus. Wherefore, the\r\ncomposition of three peppers, that from calamint, and still more that\r\nfrom Cyrenaic juice are particularly suitable to this complaint, as also\r\nthe remedies prepared from castor and the like. You will find a fuller\r\naccount of these matters in the 46th section, “on immoderate rigor and\r\ncold.” The fevers called lipyriæ, and the typhoid or smoky, and whatever\r\nothers are mentioned besides those described, being all of the same kind\r\nas the above mentioned, will require the same methods of cure as those\r\nwhich have been mentioned, or will soon be described.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates applies the term hepialus to a fever occasioned\r\nby amenorrhœa. He briefly notices the lipyria in several parts of his\r\nworks, (as Coac, 32, 27.) Galen enters minutely into the consideration\r\nof the nature and causes of the hepialus, which appears to be a variety\r\nof the quotidian intermittent. He says the fever derives its origin\r\nfrom the putrefaction of a thick phlegm resembling melted glass. Its\r\ndistinguishing characteristic is, that the patient experiences a\r\nsensation of heat and rigor at the same time.\r\n\r\nAëtius, and the other subsequent authorities, treat of the fever in the\r\nsame terms. They recommend, principally, sudorifics and calefacients.\r\n\r\nRhases, Avicenna, Serapion, and Haly treat of the epiala, and the\r\n“frigus quod non calefit,” as varieties of the quotidian. Alsaharavius\r\ngives a very distinct account of the epiala. He says it arises from a\r\ngross vitreous phlegm, and is attended with internal heat, and cold\r\nof the extremities. The pulse is small and weak, the urine white and\r\nunconcocted, and the perspiration suppressed, owing to the constriction\r\nof the pores and thickness of the humours. He approves of giving emetics,\r\nattenuants, and calefacients. The lipyriæ are treated of by Serapion,\r\nAvicenna, Rhases, and Alsaharavius. They are said to be the counterpart\r\nof the epialæ, being distinguished by internal cold and external heat.\r\nRhases describes the hepialus as consisting of internal heat and external\r\ncold. He says it arises from vitreous phlegm. The lipyria, he states, is\r\none of the worst varieties of ardent fevers.\r\n\r\nThe rigor without heat, or “frigus quod non calefit,” is a febrile\r\naffection still met with in warm climates.\r\n\r\nThe term _typhus_, now generally applied to the common fever of this\r\ncountry, is used by Hippocrates, in his work on ‘Internal Affections,’\r\nwhere he describes five varieties of the disease. They are cases of\r\nardent fever, attended with stupor and insensibility. The term _typhodes_\r\noccurs in Galen’s ‘Commentaries on Hippocrates;’ in his work, ‘De Diff.\r\nFeb.’ (i, 9); and ‘De Prognost. Puls.’ (ii, 9.) Leo defines a typhous\r\nfever to be one in which the heat is weak and concealed. (14.) It would\r\nappear that the fevers to which the ancients applied the term _typhoid_\r\nwere either intermittents or remittents. Isidorus thus defines typhous\r\nfevers: “Typhi sunt frigidæ febres, quæ abusivè typhi appellantur ab\r\nherbâ quæ nascitur in aquis quæ Latinè _forma_ atque _status_ dicitur:\r\nest enim accessionum revolutio per statuta temporum intervalla.” (Orig.\r\niv, 7.) The word τύφος occurs in Marcus Antoninus (ii, 17), where Gataker\r\nremarks, “Est enim τύφος κυρίως idem quod κάπνος, fumus.” Salmasius gives\r\nthe derivation of the term as follows: “τύφος proprie est fomes, τύφεσθαι\r\nenim ἠσυχῆ κάιεσθαι Græci exponunt.” (In Tertulliani Librum de Pallio\r\nAnnot. 318.)\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus thus explains the nature of typhoid fevers: “Has febres\r\nexterius mites seu obscuras intus turbantes Græci _typhodes_ appellant,\r\nquippe quæ naturam multitudine humorum gravatam, ac fere suffocatam,\r\nincendium foras transmittere nequeuntem, significent. Hasque vulgus\r\nmedicorum appellat, foris mites, intus conturbantes; suntque eæ omnes,\r\nadmodum perniciosæ.” (De Præsag. Vita et Morte Ægrot. i, 10.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXVII.—ON THE CONTINUAL FEVERS.\r\n\r\nThe continual fevers are allied to each of the intermittents; thus, to\r\nthe true tertian is allied the causus or ardent fever; to the quotidian,\r\nthat fever which has a paroxysm every day, but does not terminate in a\r\ncomplete freedom from fever; and, in like manner, to the quartan, that\r\nwhich has an exacerbation every fourth day. For the true causus has all\r\nthe other characteristics of the tertian, and differs from it only in\r\nnot commencing with a rigor, nor ending in a complete remission of the\r\nfever. The continual fever which has an exacerbation every day, possesses\r\nall the other characteristics of a quotidian, except that it does not\r\nterminate in a perfect apyrexy. In like manner, the continual fever\r\nwhich has an exacerbation every fourth day, but does not terminate in a\r\ncomplete apyrexy, is allied to the quartan. A continual fever, therefore,\r\nis one which does not terminate in any interval from fever until it is\r\naltogether resolved. But when it evinces no remission, it is, indeed, of\r\nthe same class as the ardent fevers, but differs from them in acuteness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates has stated the alliance between the intermittent\r\nand continual fevers. (Epidem., Op. Galeni, ed. Basil, v, p. 362.) In his\r\nreport of the epidemical diseases of a certain season, he mentions that\r\nthe continual fevers (συνεχεῖς) were distinguished by an exacerbation\r\nevery alternate day, after the manner of tertians, and that they were\r\nattended with ardent symptoms. He also remarks their tendency to\r\nterminate in dysenteries, lienteries, and tenesmus.\r\n\r\nGalen marks a distinction between the continual fever (συνεχῆς) and the\r\nsynochus, which it is necessary that the reader should particularly\r\nattend to. He remarks that there are three varieties of intermittents:\r\nthe quotidian, which arises from putrid phlegm; the tertian, from yellow\r\nbile; and the quartan, from black bile. Of continual fevers, arising\r\nfrom yellow bile, there are two species; the one being called synochi,\r\nand consisting of one paroxysm from beginning to end; and the other,\r\nto which the generic appellation continual (συνεχεῖς) is particularly\r\napplied, and which consists of a number of particular paroxyms. Of the\r\ncontinual fevers, some assume the tertian type, having a remission of\r\nthe fever every alternate day; some the quotidian, and have a remission\r\nevery day; and others, of rare occurrence, resemble the quartans, in\r\nhaving remissions after an interval of three days. (De Diff. Feb. ii, 2.)\r\nIn another place he says of synochous fevers that they consist of two\r\nvarieties, the one arising from an ebullition of the blood, and being\r\nproduced by the conversion of ephemerals; and the other arising from\r\nputrefaction of the blood in persons who are gross and plethoric. (Meth.\r\nMed. ix.)\r\n\r\nAëtius treats of continual fevers (συνεχεῖς) in nearly the same terms as\r\nour author, and distinguishes them from the synochi.\r\n\r\nAlexander states that the continual fevers (συνεχεῖς) differ from the\r\nintermittents, solely from the humours which occasion the former being of\r\na thicker nature.\r\n\r\nOur author’s account is nearly copied word for word from Oribasius.\r\n\r\nActuarius remarks that the synochus proceeds from an ebullition of\r\nthe blood, and the continual fever (συνεχὴς) from putrefaction of the\r\ndifferent humours.\r\n\r\nNonnus states very distinctly the difference between the synochus and\r\ncontinual fever. In the latter, he says, there is an incomplete remission\r\nof the febrile symptoms, but in the former there is no remission at all.\r\n\r\nSynesius and Constantinus Africanus adopt the distinction between the\r\nsynochus and continual fever, as stated by Galen.\r\n\r\nLeo says, a continual fever has no intermission, but merely a remission\r\nand abatement of the fever in the decline of the paroxyms.\r\n\r\nCelsus, although he does not describe the _febres continuæ_ particularly,\r\nseems to allude to them in the following account of the quotidians:\r\n“Rursus aliæ sic desinunt, ut ex toto sequatur integritas; aliæ sic, ut\r\naliquantum quidem minuatur ex febre, nihilominus tamen quædam reliquiæ\r\nremaneant, donec altera accessio accedat; ac sæpe aliæ vix quidquam aut\r\nnihil remittant, sed ita ut continuent.”\r\n\r\nIn the works of Rhases, the distinction between the continual and\r\nsynochous fevers is clearly pointed out. He states that the synochus, or\r\n_continens_, is a fever which consists of one paroxysm from beginning\r\nto end; whereas the continual, called συνεχὴς by the Greeks, and _f.\r\ncontinua_ by the Romans, is allied to the intermittents.\r\n\r\nIn the barbarous translation of Alsaharavius, there is some difficulty\r\nin recognizing this distinction. He first describes a fever, which he\r\ndenominates _synocha_, which arises, he says, from inflammation of the\r\nblood, and is marked by redness of the face, headach, and difficulty of\r\nbreathing. Second, nearly allied to it is the synochus or februs continua\r\n(it ought to be _f. continens_), which arises from putrefaction of the\r\nblood. Third, the febris quotidiana, the febris tertiana continua,\r\nand the febris quartana continua, which are distinguished from their\r\ncorresponding intermittents by being attended with a partial remission\r\nand not a complete intermission of the febrile symptoms.\r\n\r\nAvicenna describes the tertian intermittent by the name of febris\r\ntertiana periodica, and the continual tertian by that of tertiana\r\ncontinua; the quotidian intermittent by the name of febris phlegmatica\r\nperiodica, and the continual quotidian by that of febris phlegmatica\r\ninseparabilis, or latica; the quartan intermittent by the name of\r\nquartana periodica, and the continual quartan by that of quartana\r\ncontinua. The synochus he calls by the name of febris sanguinis; and, in\r\ntreating of it, remarks that Galen is guilty of inconsistency in stating\r\nthe proximate cause of it; for that in one place he says it arises from\r\nthe blood, and in another from bile. Averrhoes states the same objections\r\nto Galen’s account of the origin of synochous fevers.\r\n\r\nAvenzoar marks the distinction between the intermittent and the continual\r\nquotidians, tertians, and quartans.\r\n\r\nWe have been more than usually minute in explaining the opinions of the\r\nancients with regard to the Continual fevers, because much confusion has\r\narisen in modern nosological treatises and works on medicine, from the\r\ndistinction between them and the synochi not being properly understood.\r\nAfter what has been said, the medical reader will readily perceive\r\nthat the Continual fevers (συνεχεῖς) of the Greeks are the same as the\r\nRemittent fevers described by Pringle, Monro, and other English authors\r\nof that age who have treated of fevers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXVIII.—THE DIAGNOSIS AND CURE OF SYNOCHOUS FEVERS.\r\n\r\nSynochous fevers are produced sometimes by effervescence of the\r\nblood alone, and sometimes by putrefaction of the same, arising from\r\nobstruction, and have, therefore, but one paroxysm from beginning to\r\nend. The symptoms are, pulse very great, strong, quick, dense, equable;\r\nbut they are not pungent; and the urine is little different from the\r\nnatural. The cure of them consists in bloodletting _ad deliquium_. And\r\nthose who are affected with these fevers, and are not bled, run the most\r\nimminent danger. But if anything should prevent us from having recourse\r\nto phlebotomy, we must use such other remedies as are calculated to\r\nremove obstructions, those which evacuate, and such as will allay the\r\neffervescence of the blood. But when in these cases you remark symptoms\r\nof concoction of the humours, and there is neither inflammation,\r\nœdematous swelling, nor scirrhus in any important part, nor any part\r\ncold, so as that the evil may be determined to it, you may boldly give\r\ncold water, more especially if the patient has been accustomed to cold\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. After what we have said in the preceding section, and in the\r\nsection on Ephemerals, it will be unnecessary to enter into any detailed\r\naccount of the ancient opinions with regard to the nature of synochus. It\r\nis to be distinctly recollected, however, that all the authorities from\r\nHippocrates to Actuarius held, with Galen, that the synochi are produced\r\neither by an ebullition of the blood, as in the case of neglected\r\nephemerals, or from putrefaction of this fluid. (See Meth. Med. ix.)\r\n\r\nIn other parts of his works Galen seems, indeed, to hold that these\r\nfevers are connected with corruptions of the bile, and we shall not\r\nattempt to defend him from the charges of inconsistence and contradiction\r\nwith which he is assailed by Avicenna and Averrhoes. His treatment is\r\nwell deserving of our attention. He inculcates with becoming earnestness\r\nthat the great remedies for synochous fevers are bleeding and cold\r\ndrink. He approves of bleeding _ad deliquium animi_, and relates an\r\ninteresting case of its good effects. (Meth. Med. ix.) When the pulse is\r\nlarge and firm, he insists that no considerations of age, strength, or\r\nany other circumstance, ought to deter the physician from abstracting\r\nblood freely. He directs the apartments of the sick to be kept cool and\r\nwell ventilated, and to have the floors sprinkled and rendered fragrant\r\nby means of suitable flowers. The diet is to be of a light and diluent\r\nnature, especially at the acme of the fever. (Therap. ad Glauc. i.) He\r\nforbids the bath when inflammation is present. (Hyg.)\r\n\r\nAëtius conducts the treatment upon the same principles as Galen, and the\r\ndirections which he gives for the application of the different remedies\r\nare most important. He states most decidedly, that unless venesection\r\nis had recourse to, the patient will be in the utmost danger, and can\r\nonly be saved by the strength of his constitution, or some critical\r\nevacuation. When the stomach is loaded, however, he forbids depletion,\r\nbecause, by emptying the veins, the distribution of the crudities in\r\nthe _primæ viæ_ will be accelerated. When the menstrual or hemorrhodial\r\ndischarge is expected, he directs us to bleed less profusely than\r\notherwise. Persons of a hard, sanguine, and compact habit of body are\r\nsaid to bear bleeding best. In practising venesection, he directs the\r\nphysician to pay more attention to the strength of the patient than to\r\nthe period of the fever. He is particularly earnest in recommending the\r\nuse of cold drink: he directs it to be given at the acme of the disease,\r\nbut not at the commencement. He forbids us to administer it freely when\r\nthere is obstruction or inflammation of an internal viscus; and states\r\nmany serious evils which may arise from the unseasonable administration\r\nof cold water, although it be an excellent remedy when given at the\r\nproper time. With regard to diet, he directs nothing but ptisan to be\r\ngiven for the first three days. On the fourth he recommends the bath.\r\nThrough the whole course of the fever the food is to be light, unless the\r\npowers of the patient be very feeble.\r\n\r\nAs the other Greek authorities differ in no material respect from the\r\nprinciples of treatment laid down by Galen and Aëtius, we need not enter\r\nupon any minute exposition of their views of practice. As a specimen,\r\nhowever, of the practice of the later authors, we shall briefly mention\r\nthat of Synesius and Constantinus Africanus. They approve of bleeding,\r\nunless the stomach be loaded with crudities; in which case they forbid\r\nthe operation until these are concocted or discharged. They recommend\r\ndiluents; and, if the belly is constipated, clysters, with decoctions,\r\ncontaining tamarinds, damascenes, manna, and the like. To remove the\r\nremains of the febrile excitement in the decline of the fever, they\r\ndirect medicines of a refrigerant nature to be given, such as camphor,\r\nthe seeds of melons, cucumbers, gourds, and the like.\r\n\r\nPalladius gives the following directions for the treatment of fevers\r\nin general. In all these diseases the skilful physician ought to know\r\nand understand accurately the constitution and temperament of the sick;\r\nand the peculiar form of the fever, and the formation, movement, onset,\r\nincrease, and acme of every disease, and the analogies of the paroxysms,\r\nand the returns of the periods. And the first and general object in\r\nall these diseases is to clear the body of impurities, and render it\r\nperspirable; and the second in order is to contend with the prevailing\r\ncause; for the work of the physician in all cases is to rectify whatever\r\nis amiss about the body. (De Febribus, 29.)\r\n\r\nCelsus recommends venesection in all fevers at the commencement, provided\r\nthe patient is not very young, weak, or has crudities in his stomach;\r\nbut after the fourth day he does not approve of it. He also makes some\r\ningenious remarks on the contrary methods of giving water and wine in\r\ncases of fever. He recommends the latter when there is cold, torpor, and\r\nrestlessness. He likewise mentions the affusion of cold water and oil,\r\nwith the intention of changing the morbid state of action.\r\n\r\nIn the Epistle of Vindicianus, physician to the Emperor Valentinian,\r\nthere is an interesting history of a fever, arising from indigestion\r\nand obstruction of the bowels, brought on by excess in eating and\r\ndrinking. In this case Vindicianus, in opposition to the advice of the\r\nother professional attendants, would not administer a clyster, and gave\r\nhis patient nothing but salt and water, which procured first copious\r\nperspirations, and afterwards free evacuations of the bowels. He then\r\ndirected him to use the bath, and completed the cure by giving wormwood\r\nto remove obstructions. This is a well-marked case of intestinal fever.\r\n(Fabricii Bibl. Græc. t. xiii.)\r\n\r\nWe may state the general characters of the urine as given in an\r\ninteresting little treatise, ‘On the Urine,’ lately published by Ideler.\r\nIn synochous fevers, as being connected with fulness of blood, the urine\r\nis red, thick, and indicating by its colour and consistence the want of\r\nconcoction. (De Urinis Commentatio.)\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas, during the first three days, strongly recommends venesection,\r\nwhich, he says, will either have the effect of cutting short the fever\r\nat once, or of rendering it milder. His other remedies are altogether\r\nrefrigerant, consisting of acidulated drinks, and gentle purgatives,\r\nsuch as prunes, tamarinds, and the like. Alsaharavius, in like manner,\r\nrecommends depletion, and the refrigerant plan of treatment.\r\n\r\nSerapion strongly recommends bleeding, _ad deliquium animi_, which,\r\nhe says, will probably have the effect of procuring discharges from\r\nthe bowels, and of promoting perspiration. He admits of venesection\r\neven after the sixth or seventh day, when other circumstances indicate\r\nit. He further prescribes refrigerant remedies, such as tamarinds,\r\ncassia-fistula, and the like.\r\n\r\nAverrhoes, although he approves of venesection, condemns Galen’s\r\ndirection to carry it the length of bringing on _deliquium animi_. He\r\nalso cautions against carrying the administration of cold drink too far.\r\n\r\nAvenzoar strongly recommends bleeding _ad deliquium_. Avicenna likewise\r\napproves of this practice. When the strength does not permit to carry\r\ndepletion so far, he directs us to open the temporal veins, or to\r\nabstract blood by cupping. In such cases he also recommends purgatives\r\nand refrigerant medicines. Towards the conclusion of the fever he directs\r\nthe trochisks of camphor to be given.\r\n\r\nRhases gives an excellent account of synochus. His remedies are bleeding,\r\ngentle purgatives, acidulated drinks, restricted diet, and complete\r\nabstinence from wine. He particularly recommends aloes as a purgative.\r\n(See, in particular, Contin. xxx, v, 2.) He approves of the bath, but\r\nprefers delaying the use of it until the decline of the fever. He is\r\nvery decided in recommending bleeding, unless the patient be of a weak\r\nconstitution, or his system loaded with crudities. After the fever is\r\nconcocted, he approves of giving cold water freely for drink.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXIX.—ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF ARDENT FEVERS.\r\n\r\nThe following symptoms accompany ardent fevers: tongue dry, rough,\r\nand black, griping of the stomach, excrements pale, strong thirst,\r\nwatchfulness, and sometimes delirium.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s description of the _causus_, or ardent fever,\r\nis taken from Hippocrates (de Rat. Vic. Acut.), where the commentary\r\nof Galen is worth consulting. According to Hippocrates, the causus is\r\ngenerally produced in the summer season, owing to the veins becoming dry\r\nand attracting bilious humours. In other parts of his works he gives an\r\naccount of several varieties of the disease, differing considerably in\r\ncharacter from that described in the above-mentioned work. For example,\r\none variety mentioned in his ‘Epidemics’ was distinguished by the absence\r\nof thirst and delirium, and by the paroxyms occurring on the even days.\r\n(See Galen’s Commentary, Opera, ed. Basil. t. v, 424; also, de Morbis,\r\ni, 27; and Coacæ, 130.) He further describes, under the head of causus,\r\nvarious cases of febrile complaints after childbirth and abortion, which\r\nwould now be called puerperal fevers. (Epidem. iii.)\r\n\r\nAretæus delivers a most striking description of ardent fevers, which\r\nwe regret that our limits prevent us from giving at full length. The\r\nfollowing are some of the most important symptoms: the heat acrid and\r\nsubtile, especially in the internal parts, desire of cold air and of\r\ncold things, the extremities cold, the pulse dense and small, the eyes\r\nclear, bright, and reddish; and, if the fever go on increasing, delirium,\r\noblivion of every thing, lividity of the nails, frequent respiration,\r\nprofuse perspiration about the forehead and neck, coldness of the body,\r\nand at last a complete collapse marked by a return of the powers of\r\nreason and certain indications of a prophetic spirit. This is but a\r\nmeagre outline of his matchless delineation of the phenomena of causus.\r\n\r\nAs all the Greek, Latin, and Arabian writers treat of causus in nearly\r\nthe same terms as Hippocrates, we shall be very brief in noticing their\r\ndescriptions. According to Alexander, there are two varieties of causus,\r\nthe true and the spurious, the former being marked by intense thirst,\r\nbilious stools, tongue rough and black; and the latter by the thirst\r\nbeing moderate, the tongue not black, and the stools consisting not of\r\nbilious matters, but rather of corrupted food. The former kind is said to\r\nbe occasioned by a bilious, and the latter by a pituitous humour. Aëtius\r\ndescribes the disease in the same terms as our author. He says that it\r\nis produced by putrefaction of yellow bile. Palladius says that ardent\r\nfevers are occasioned by an erysipelatous inflammation of the lungs, or\r\nby the putrefaction of bilious humours which have become immoderately\r\nheated. The Arabians describe it exactly as the Greeks. According to\r\nAvicenna, there are two varieties of the disease, the bilious and\r\nthe pituitous. The inseparable symptoms of the disease are, he says,\r\nconcealed heat, roughness, and, at last, blackness of the tongue. There\r\nis no perspiration until after the crisis. For the most part the heat is\r\nnot strong in the external parts, but is particularly so in the internal.\r\nRhases states that the ardent fever called καῦσος by the Greeks belongs\r\nto the class of tertians, only that in the former the heat is more\r\nintense, and the paroxysms do not terminate in a complete intermission\r\nof the febrile symptoms. The symptoms, he adds, bear a considerable\r\nresemblance to those of the tertian intermittent, but are more strongly\r\nmarked. According to Alsaharavius, the causus, or ardent fever, is\r\noccasioned by heated bile collected in the veins adjoining to the heart,\r\nstomach, or liver, and its symptoms resemble those of tertians, but are\r\nmore intense.\r\n\r\nFrom the above exposition of the opinions of the ancients regarding the\r\ncausus, or ardent fever, the medical reader will readily recognize its\r\nidentity with the bilious remittent fever of Sir John Pringle and other\r\nEnglish authors. If there were any doubt on this head, it would be set\r\naside by the description of the symptoms of ardent fever which is given\r\nby the late Dr. Robert Jackson, as they were manifested in his own person\r\nduring a severe attack of it. (On Fever, 403.)\r\n\r\nSome late writers have confounded the causus of the ancients with\r\nsynocha, or inflammatory fever. But, as we have said, and as was\r\ncorrectly stated by Baccius, the causus was decidedly of the continual\r\nor remittent type, and nearly allied to the tertian intermittent. (De\r\nThermis.) Hoffman remarks that it seldom appears in the more temperate\r\nparts of Europe, but is very common in Asia, Greece, and Italy; and\r\nhence the frequent mention of it in the works of Hippocrates, Galen, and\r\nAretæus. (Oper. t. ii, § 2, c. 2.)\r\n\r\nHomer says that the dog-star brings many fevers upon unhappy mortals\r\n(Iliad, xxi, 31); and his commentator Eustathius remarks that the poet\r\ncorrectly refers the origin of ardent fevers to the heat of the dog-days.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXX.—THE CURE OF ARDENT FEVERS.\r\n\r\nEither of the following things must take place, that this fever may\r\nterminate completely; the bilious humours must either be evacuated or\r\nextinguished. They are evacuated then by sweating, vomiting, or purging\r\ndownwards; but they are extinguished by cold drink, with which we have\r\nentirely cured ardent fevers. For diet, those in causus should not take\r\nwater alone, nor mead alone, but boiled mead much diluted with water; for\r\nthe food of such persons ought to consist entirely of drinks. The bath\r\nwill suit with those only affected with causus who are free from all\r\ninflammatory and erysipelatous swelling. And if they exhibit signs of\r\nconcoction, it will suit still better with them; but not so if the fever\r\nbe occasioned by a saltish humour. These should be supported with the\r\njuice of ptisan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s directions respecting the treatment are\r\nmostly taken from Hippocrates (de Rat. Vict. Acut.) Hippocrates allows\r\nvenesection only when the attack is violent. He approves of the\r\napplication of cold water to the surface. Archigenes, as Aëtius informs\r\nus, sponged the head and chest with cold water during the acme of ardent\r\nfevers. (iii. 159.) His own treatment, which is borrowed from Philumenus\r\nand Galen, consisted of cooling remedies internally and externally, such\r\nas drinking cold water and other things of a refrigerant nature, using\r\ncold applications, and the cold bath, (v, 28.) Alexander, Oribasius,\r\nSynesius, and Constantinus Africanus treat the causus upon the same plan\r\nas our author. They say nothing of bleeding. Celsus likewise omits to\r\nmake mention of venesection, but recommends refrigerants, and especially\r\ncold water to be given, even to satiety. He forbids it, however, when\r\nthere is any affection of the internal viscera, and when there is a\r\ncough. He informs us that Asclepiades, of Bithynia, strongly recommended\r\ngestation for the cure of this fever.\r\n\r\nAverrhoes abstracts blood when there are symptoms of plethora, gives\r\ngentle purgatives, such as tamarinds, and allows the patient cool drink\r\nand cool air. Haly Abbas treats the causus entirely upon the refrigerant\r\nplan, with cold drink, cooling fruits, fresh air, gentle laxatives, such\r\nas prunes, and by cold applications to the skin. Alsaharavius conducts\r\nthe treatment upon much the same principles. When the patient is troubled\r\nwith protracted watchfulness, he directs us to rub the temples with the\r\njuice of poppies, lettuces, and coriander. Avicenna also speaks favorably\r\nof these soporifics, but does not in general approve of bleeding. The\r\ntreatment recommended by Rhases is altogether refrigerant. He directs\r\nus to clear away the asperities of the tongue, and then to give cooling\r\nand acid drinks. When there is no inflammation of any internal viscus,\r\nhe permits water cooled with snow. He says nothing of venesection.\r\nHowever, some of his authorities, as quoted in his ‘Continens,’ recommend\r\nbleeding. They seem in general to have approved of keeping the patient\r\nin a cool room perfumed with aromatic and fragrant herbs. One of them\r\napproves of applying over the stomach a robe moistened with a fluid\r\nprepared from camphor, rose oil, &c.\r\n\r\nWe omitted to mention that Hippocrates states that children at the\r\nbreast are subject to attacks of causus, by which of course he meant the\r\ninfantile remittent fever, first well described some years ago by Dr.\r\nButter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXI.—DIAGNOSIS AND CURE OF FEVERS WITH AN ERYSIPELATOUS AFFECTION.\r\n\r\nFevers accompanied with an erysipelatous affection about the viscera,\r\nmay be known by the vehement effervescence and violent pain in the part,\r\nalso, by the thirst and inordinate burning; in a word, by the symptoms\r\nof very acrid bile putrefied along with a deficient blood. They are to\r\nbe treated in this manner: the patient must abstain altogether from the\r\nbath, and at the acme of the complaint, use very cold water in the most\r\ndecided manner. Yet it must not be used at the commencement, but cold\r\nthings are to be applied externally; and if this is not sufficient, they\r\nmust be taken internally. Lettuces and such like things are particularly\r\nbefitting. The juice of the lettuce is likewise a seasonable application\r\nexternally, also, that of the house-leek (_semper-vivum_), and such\r\nlike cooling things. We may use the following application, which is an\r\nexcellent one: Squeezing out the juice of some cooling thing, we put\r\nit into a mortar with purslain, then pound and strain it; at the time\r\nof using, we mix a little polenta with it, and place it in cold water\r\nto cool it. A piece of cloth folded double is to be put into it, and\r\nafterwards applied to the hypochondrium, and not suffered to remain, but\r\nanother cold one must be substituted. We sometimes mix the oil of unripe\r\nolives.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This section is mostly taken from Oribasius, (Synops. vi,\r\n20.) On erysipelas of the lungs consult Hippocrates, (De Morbis, i, 13,\r\nand ii, 53.) Hippocrates says in one of his aphorisms (vi, 25), that\r\nit is dangerous when an external erysipelas is determined internally,\r\nbut favorable when an internal erysipelas is determined externally. He\r\ndescribes an epidemical erysipelas which was attended with extensive\r\ngangrene of the limbs, but did not often prove fatal. (Epid. i.)\r\n\r\nThe following are the symptoms of fever connected with erysipelatous\r\ninflammation, as detailed by Alexander: The patient experiences thirst\r\nmore strikingly than in any other case, throws the clothes off his body,\r\nhas exacerbations every third day, with bilious and ichorous discharges\r\nfrom the bowels; those in whom the erysipelatous inflammation is seated\r\nin the lungs have not so intense thirst, but breathe thick and large,\r\ntheir cheeks are red, tongue rough, they are delirious, and long rather\r\nfor cool air, and are more benefited by it than by cool drink, which\r\nought rather to be given to those who have erysipelatous inflammation in\r\nany other part, whereas those in whom the lungs are affected ought to\r\nbe supplied with cool air. In ordinary cases he approves of giving cold\r\nwater to extinguish the fever, but says that he has seen patients brought\r\nto imminent danger by the unseasonable application of cold cataplasms and\r\nclysters.\r\n\r\nAëtius states that fevers are kindled by the parts about the bowels,\r\nliver, and lungs, being attacked with erysipelas. Like our author, he\r\napproves of cold drink, cool air, and cold applications to the part\r\naffected. (v, 88.)\r\n\r\nThe acute affection of the vena cava, which is minutely described by\r\nAretæus, ought probably to be ranked with the diseases which we are now\r\ntreating of. He himself is in doubt whether to consider it as a species\r\nof causus. Like the latter, he says, it has a tendency to pass into\r\nsyncope. (De Sign. Morb. Acut. iii, 8.) He recommends for it venesection\r\nand the refrigerant plan of treatment. (Cur. Morb. Acut. ii, 7.) We have\r\nstated in the xxixth section that Palladius refers one variety of ardent\r\nfever to erysipelas of the lungs.\r\n\r\nA similar account of these affections is given by Avicenna, (iv, i, 4, c.\r\n13, 14, and 15); and by Rhases (ad Mansor. x, 15, _alibique_.)\r\n\r\nWe can draw no information from modern works to illustrate the opinions\r\nof the ancients respecting the febrile affections treated of in this\r\nsection. It does not seem to be suspected now that erysipelas ever\r\nattacks the lungs or bowels; and yet, as this disease when it occurs\r\nexternally is known to be seated principally in the epidermis, and as\r\nthe epithelium, or membrane which lines the internal cavities, is\r\nadmitted to be a prolongation of it, (see Kaau Boerhaave, Perspiratio\r\nDicta Hippocrati,) it would seem probable _a priori_, that the diseases\r\nof both portions of it should be alike. That fevers are often complicated\r\nwith ardent affections of the lungs and bowels, and bilious symptoms,\r\nwe all admit; and it was, no doubt, to such febrile affections that the\r\nancients gave the name of fevers from erysipelas—erysipelas, as we shall\r\nsee afterwards, being referred by them to the state of the bile. One\r\ncannot but admire the sagacity of Hippocrates in tracing the connexion\r\nand resemblance between the diseases of the epidermis and those of the\r\nepithelium. (See Littré’s Hippocrat. t. iv, 419.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXII.—DIAGNOSIS OF HECTIC FEVERS.\r\n\r\nThe hectic fever is not only seated in the fluids and spirits, but also\r\nin the solid parts. It is unaccompanied with pain, and those affected\r\nwith this fever imagine that they have no fever at all, for they are\r\nsensible of no heat, all the parts being heated equally. There are two\r\nkinds of hectic fevers, the one for the most part supervening upon ardent\r\nfevers which have been protracted so long as to consume in time all the\r\njuices in the body of the heart; the other may come on while it remains\r\nplentiful. The former constitute not only hectic but marasmus. Those that\r\ncome on while the juices of the heart remain, seize upon the body of the\r\nheart, and hence the febrile flame is kindled, like the flame of a lamp\r\nfrom its wick. This is one of the modes of formation. The other mode is,\r\nwhen they make their attack originally, commencing like ephemeral fevers,\r\nfrom grief, anger, or much fatigue attended with heat. These may be cured\r\nwithout difficulty; but those of them which have terminated in marasmus,\r\nit is impossible to cure. A hectic fever which is running into marasmus\r\nmay be easily recognized. You may see the patients’ eyes immeasurably\r\nhollow, dry rheums determined to them, and they have a certain squalid\r\nappearance. The vital bloom of their colour is gone; their forehead is\r\nparched and stretched; they constantly wink as if asleep, and yet the\r\naffection is not sleep, but an inability to keep awake; their temples\r\nare collapsed; and what remains, but the bones and skin alone? If you\r\nlay bare, and examine the parts about the abdomen, you will fancy that\r\nnone of the entrails and intestines remain, and that the hypochondrium\r\nis forcibly drawn upwards. The skin is parched in the last extreme, the\r\npulse slender, dense, and hard. The heat on the first application of the\r\nhand seems faint, but soon afterwards feels acrid and pungent. While,\r\ntherefore, any of the natural moisture remains, the fever is only hectic;\r\nbut when the humidity runs the risk of being altogether consumed, a true\r\nmarasmus is formed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author has copied from Oribasius (Synops. vi, 21), who in\r\nhis turn is indebted to Galen (de Diff. Feb. i, 11.) A similar account\r\nis given in somewhat fuller terms by Aëtius (v, 92.) See also Alexander\r\n(xii, 4.) We shall merely give his explanation of the characters of\r\nthe pulse. It is hard and small, because the vessels have become dry\r\nand contracted; it is dense (frequent?) because the necessities of\r\nthe system require it to be so, (namely, in order to make up for the\r\nreduced expansion of the artery); it is feeble, owing to the weakness\r\nof the vital powers; and slender, because the vessel does not admit of\r\nbeing stretched in breadth. Nonnus and Actuarius derive their views\r\nfrom Galen. According to the latter, hectic fever is a very dangerous\r\ndisease when it arises from the conversion of any other fever, but when\r\nconnected with inflammation or scirrhus of any vital organ it is almost\r\nincurable. Palladius says that the hectic is an unceasing fever, wasting\r\nand consuming the natural humidity of all the members, and supervening\r\nfor the most part upon acute and ardent fevers, but sometimes arising\r\nfrom sympathy with some vital organ. He states it as a characteristic of\r\nthe hectic fever, that food increases the febrile heat, in like manner\r\nas water poured upon unslacked lime enkindles heat. This comparison\r\nis borrowed from Galen, and is repeated also by Alexander and Nonnus.\r\nPalladius, like our author, represents marasmus as the termination of the\r\nhectic fever. It is distinguished, he says, by prostration of the natural\r\nfaculties, aridity, and wasting of the body, which becomes dried and\r\nparched like a tree deprived of its juices by exposure to excessive heat.\r\n\r\nAccording to Haly Abbas, hectic fevers commonly arise either from the\r\nconversion of semi-tertians, or from abscesses of the lungs, whence\r\nheat is sent to the heart, and from it is diffused over the system.\r\n(Theor. viii, 7.) Alsaharavius states that hectic fevers arise from\r\nprotracted ephemeral or putrid fevers, or from sympathy of the system\r\nwith ulceration of the lungs, bladder, or liver, or from any chronic and\r\nprolonged disease. (Pract. xxxii.) Averrhoes represents the hectic as\r\nsupervening upon ephemeral and putrid fevers. He ridicules the comparison\r\nof the effects of food on the febrile heat to those of water poured upon\r\nlime. (Collig. iv, 33.) Avenzoar gives the same account of hectic as our\r\nauthor. (iii. 3, c. 13.) Serapion’s account, although borrowed from the\r\nGreeks, is distinct and curious (vi, 11.) See also Rhases (ad Mansor.\r\nx, 3, _alibique_.) He and Haly Abbas repeat the graphic delineation\r\nof a person in the last stage of hectic fever, borrowed by our author\r\nfrom Galen, who seems to have had in view a similar description of a\r\nperson sinking of consumption, given by Aretæus. (De Morb. Chron. i, 8.)\r\nAvicenna’s account of the nature and causes of hectic fevers is so ample,\r\nthat we regret our limits will not permit us to do justice to it. The\r\nprincipal causes of them which he enumerates are ephemeral and putrid\r\nfevers, and abscesses of the lungs and liver. The pulse, he says, is\r\nhard, small, frequent, and weak, and may become _myurus_, if the fever\r\npass into the state of marasmus. He gives, principally from Galen (de\r\nMarasmo), an interesting description of what he calls the _hectic of old\r\nage_, but which Galen calls _old age from disease_. Its symptoms, as\r\ndescribed by these authors, are coldness and aridity of the body; the\r\npulse slow, small, and rare, unless very weak; the urine white, thin, and\r\nwatery. (iv, 1, 3.) Franciscus de Pedemontio, a writer of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, in like manner pronounces the hectic of old age to be a dry\r\nintemperament of the system, and recommends for it a calefacient and\r\nmoistening regimen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXIII.—THE CURE OF HECTIC FEVERS.\r\n\r\nThose affected with hectic fevers should be well supplied with food from\r\nthe commencement, on account of the pungency of the humours. The best\r\ncure is a moistening diet. You ought therefore to give for nourishment\r\nthe juice of ptisan, and broths of chondrus, with a little bread in\r\naddition; and to treat the patient with a draught, of moderately cold\r\nwater, when neither inflammation nor putrefaction of the humours is\r\npresent. But if you conclude that the lesion is great, you must proscribe\r\nthe cold water, and have recourse to the cooling applications externally.\r\nTo those affected in this manner, baths are at all times proper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This section is taken from Oribasius (Synops. vi, 22.) It\r\nwill be remarked that our author’s treatment consists of diluents and\r\nrefrigerants internally, with cold applications and baths. It is entirely\r\nderived from Galen. Galen defends, in very strong terms, the use of the\r\ncold bath, which had been condemned by a celebrated physician of the name\r\nof Philip. (Meth. Med. x.) He admits, indeed, that an inflammatory or\r\nerysipelatous affection of a vital organ, and a redundance of crude and\r\nputrid humours in the body, may compel us to abstain from the bath; but,\r\nin all other circumstances of hectic fever, he insists that it is the\r\n_remedium unicum_. He also recommends cold drink and cold applications\r\nto the part primarily affected. He speaks favorably also of the internal\r\nadministration of refrigerants, such as lettuces, which may also be\r\napplied externally. (De Marasmo.) For diet, he recommends articles of a\r\ndiluent and cooling nature, such as ptisan, bread steeped in cold water,\r\nand the milk of asses. (Meth. Med. l. c.)\r\n\r\nAëtius, in like manner, recommends the bath, unless the use of it be\r\ncontraindicated by the inflammation of some vital organ, or a fever\r\nenkindled by the putrescency of the humours. He gives minute directions\r\nfor the application of the bath, the amount of which is this, that,\r\nunder certain circumstances, it will be most prudent to use the tepid\r\nbath before the cold. In all cases he directs the body to be rubbed with\r\noil before going into the bath, and to be gently rubbed with towels\r\nafter coming out of it. He greatly praises the milk of asses, which he\r\nrecommends to be drunk warm.\r\n\r\nAlexander also forbids the use of the bath, when inflammation of any\r\nvital part is present. He approves greatly of the milk of asses for food.\r\nHe allows wine only when the patient is of a cold and dry intemperament.\r\nHe inculcates the necessity of ascertaining whether the hectic fever and\r\nmarasmus be connected with chronic inflammation of any internal organ,\r\nsuch as the stomach, mesentery, colon, liver, kidneys, womb, lungs, or\r\ndiaphragm, in order that the remedies may be applied to the seat of\r\nthe disease. We need not go over the practice of the subsequent Greek\r\nauthors, as they follow servilely the doctrines of Galen.\r\n\r\nAccording to Avicenna, the great indications of cure are dilution\r\nand refrigeration. To the class of refrigerant remedies he refers\r\nbarley-water, the milk of asses, and trochisks of camphor, with cooling\r\nepithemes and ointments. To the class of diluents he refers the bath,\r\nabout the administration of which he is very particular. He directs us\r\nto use the tepid bath at first, and gradually bring the patient to bear\r\nthe cold. When it can be borne, he says, the cold bath should be taken\r\nimmediately after the hot. He also speaks favorably of the affusion of\r\ntepid water.\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas directs us, when the symptoms of consumption are fairly set\r\nin, to administer before sunrise trochisks containing camphor, poppies,\r\n&c. to mitigate the cough. Like most of the other authorities, he speaks\r\nfavorably of the milk of asses and of women for food. But, upon the\r\nwhole, his greatest dependence seems to have been upon camphor. (Pr. iii,\r\n26.)\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius directs us first to make the patient go into the warm bath,\r\nand immediately afterwards to plunge him into the cold. (Pract. xxxii.)\r\n\r\nWhat Avenzoar most particularly recommends is the tepid bath of fresh\r\nwater, which he directs to be taken several times in the day. He speaks\r\nfavorably of goat’s milk. (iii, 1, 13.)\r\n\r\nAverrhoes recommends nearly the same practice; but he says that the bath\r\nought to be gradually applied. He approves of the milk of women, asses,\r\nand goats, and also of refrigerant herbs. (Colliget. vii, 15.)\r\n\r\nSerapion is very minute in his directions about the asses’ milk. He\r\nsays the animals should be fed upon juicy and cooling herbs, such as\r\ngrow by the side of rivers. He also directs us to medicate the bath, by\r\npreviously boiling in it refrigerant herbs, such as gourds, barley, and\r\nviolets. (vi, 11.)\r\n\r\nRhases’ directions, although they possess, perhaps, little originality,\r\nare in the highest degree interesting. He recommends for food fishes,\r\ncooling herbs, such as mallows, lettuces, citrons, cucumbers, &c. and\r\nthe milk of asses or of goats. He especially commends the tepid bath,\r\nand rubbing with oil afterwards. He also speaks of applying to the chest\r\ncloths soaked in rose-water, which has been cooled in snow. When these\r\ncold applications bring on shivering, he directs them to be somewhat\r\nwarmed. He forbids copious draughts of cold water. He recommends cool and\r\nhumid air, and cautions to avoid smoke. When the belly is constipated,\r\nhe gives opening medicines, such as prunes and manna. When, on the other\r\nhand, the belly is loose, he recommends astringents. He particularly\r\ncommends trochisks of camphor, which, he says, will cool the heat of the\r\nheart, liver, or chest. (Ad Mansor. x, 3; see also Contin. xxxi.) In\r\nthe latter work he informs us that physicians were divided in opinion\r\nregarding the use of the bath in hectic fever. He forbids the cold\r\nbath and cold drink when the patient is much wasted, because the cold\r\npenetrates to the vital organs and impairs them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXIV.—ON SEMI-TERTIANS.\r\n\r\nAs a tertian paroxysm commences with a rigor, and a quotidian without\r\none, the fever composed of both brings on a degree of shivering, which\r\nis less than a rigor, and greater than chillness, as being a mixture\r\nof these two extremes. Whence, this fever has not improperly got the\r\nname of semi-tertian. These fevers are formed in two ways, either\r\nthe two paroxysms uniting into one, or being mixed together from the\r\ncommencement. When, therefore, the tertian prevails, the fever is\r\nattended with a strong shivering, and has even a certain degree of rigor\r\nat the attack. Such a fever also soon becomes hotter and more ardent,\r\nand brings on some vomiting of bile, or a discharge of it downwards, or\r\nby a sweat. When the other, the pituitous, prevails, there is coldness\r\nof the extremities, but little shivering; neither are they accompanied\r\nwith thirst, nor are they ardent. But when the tertian intermittent and\r\ncontinual quotidian are equal in magnitude, the commencement of the\r\nparoxysm is with shivering; and when that from phlegm prevails, there\r\nare contractions and shiverings; but if the hotter species prevail,\r\nthey soon acquire heat. This is the true semi-tertian, being a fever\r\nformed from an equal combination of both, a tertian intermittent, and\r\na continual quotidian. But that which is not the true semi-tertian has\r\neither more of the bilious, or of the pituitous character; which species\r\nis of easiest cure, the smaller humour being readily overcome by the\r\nprevalence of the greater, or by the aid of art. When the pituitous\r\nstate prevails, we must use especially the remedies mentioned for the\r\nquotidian; or, if yellow bile, those for the tertian, always bestowing\r\nmost attention upon that which is most urgent, but not neglecting the\r\nother entirely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The reader may find histories of the semi-tertian in the\r\nEpidemics of Hippocrates, where see the Commentary of Galen. Our author’s\r\naccount is condensed from Galen (de Diff. Febr. ii, 2, and de Typis, 4.)\r\nSee Aëtius (v, 81); Actuarius (Morb. Dig. ii, 1); Nonnus (142); Celsus\r\n(iii, 8); Palladius (21.) Celsus describes it as the second species of\r\ntertian in the following terms: “Alterum longe perniciosius, quod tertio\r\nquidem die revertitur, ex octo autem et quadraginta horis fere sex et\r\ntriginta per accessionem occupat, interdum etiam vel minus, vel plus;\r\nneque ex toto in remissione desistit, sed tantum levius est. Id genus\r\nplerique medici ἠμιτριτᾶιον appellant.” He approves of bleeding at the\r\ncommencement, and of a diet that is nutritive without being heating.\r\n\r\nPalladius says that the semi-tertian is compounded of a tertian\r\nintermittent, and a continual quotidian, the quotidian paroxysm taking\r\nplace every day, and the tertian every alternate day. He ascribes\r\ntheir origin to a mixture of putrid bile and phlegm. (21.) Haly Abbas\r\ngives a similar account of it. He calls it a fever compounded of a\r\ntertian and quotidian, and remarks that it has a tendency to pass into\r\nhectic. He treats it with diluents and refrigerants. (Pract. iii, 17.)\r\nAvicenna gives a very detailed account of the symptoms and cure of the\r\nsemi-tertians. He remarks that the fever is apt to be protracted and\r\nto pass into the hectic. (iv, 1, 4.) See Rhases (Cont. xxxi.) All his\r\nauthorities agree in describing it as a compound of the tertian and\r\nquotidian, having a severe paroxysm the one day and a slighter the\r\nfollowing. It is said to be generally protracted to the fortieth day.\r\n\r\nPlatearius, and the other earlier modern writers, describe the\r\nsemi-tertian in nearly the same terms as the ancients. It is a species\r\nof fever still occasionally met with in warm climates. (See Littré’s\r\nHippocrates, t. ii, 569.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXV.—ON EPIDEMIC DISEASES.\r\n\r\nWe call those diseases epidemic and common, that attack many persons\r\ntogether; which, having a common origin, have also a common cause.\r\nCommon diseases are produced by common food of a bad quality, drinking\r\nof bad water, inordinate fatigue, the want of the customary exercise,\r\ndeprivation or repletion from the prevalence either of a famine or of\r\ngreat abundance. The nature of the country will also often occasion\r\ncommon diseases, either from its lying adjacent to marshes, or to some\r\ndeep pit, which emits a deleterious and pernicious exhalation. These\r\nthings are constantly occurring. But the atmosphere which surrounds\r\nus may alter the temperaments, by being hotter, colder, or more humid\r\nthan ordinary. For to other causes we are not all exposed together,\r\nnor do we come in contact with them for the whole day; but the ambient\r\nair is diffused around all, and is inhaled by respiration. Now, the\r\nbodies of animals must undergo a change along with these changes as\r\nto temperature. He, therefore, who is acquainted with these matters,\r\nwill not only be able to predict the diseases which are to arise from\r\nevery state of the atmosphere, but will be able also to prevent them by\r\nsubstituting a counteracting regimen to the intemperament of the air.\r\nWherefore, those bodies which are disposed to a certain disease, from\r\na peculiar intemperament, will be affected by a similar temperature\r\nof the surrounding air. But those of an opposite temperament to the\r\natmosphere will not only not be hurt but will be improved; the excess of\r\ntheir intemperament being overcome by the opposite excess. He that is\r\nacquainted with these things will preserve the health, by superinducing\r\nthe contraries to the constitution of the body; sometimes perhaps using\r\nrefrigerants, and sometimes heating things, cooling with water, using\r\nrestricted exercise and food, and plenty of dilution; and warming, by\r\nmeans of increased clothing, exercise, more food and less drink. And, by\r\nkindling a great pile, one may change the air from a humid state to that\r\nwhich is dry and hot, as they say was done by Acron of Agrigentum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is mostly taken from Oribasius (Synops. vi, 24,\r\nand Euporist. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe works of Hippocrates contain many interesting remarks on the origin\r\nand nature of epidemics. He states that diseases in general may be\r\nsaid to arise either from the food we eat or the air we breathe. When,\r\ntherefore, a disease seizes on a multitude of persons of different\r\nages, sexes, and habits, he justly infers that it must arise from the\r\nlatter cause. (See de Flatibus, Epidem. cum Commentariis Galeni.) The\r\nfevers described by Hippocrates, in his ‘Books of Epidemics,’ are in\r\ngeneral intermittent and remittent fevers. In his first and third books\r\nhe describes forty-two cases of fever, twenty-five of which had a fatal\r\ntermination. They had evidently been selected from a larger number.\r\nThe descriptions are rigidly confined to a detail of the characters of\r\nthe season and the symptoms of the epidemic. In general, scarcely any\r\nremedial means are mentioned. In some of the cases slight exanthemata\r\nspeedily disappearing are mentioned among the symptoms. These are more\r\nlikely to have been _petechiæ_ than the typhous eruption. It is reported\r\nof Hippocrates, that, like Acron of Agrigentum, he changed the morbific\r\nstate of the atmosphere at Athens by kindling fires. (Galen, Therap. ad\r\nPison; Aëtius, v, 94.) Acron’s method of purifying the atmosphere is\r\nmentioned by Plutarch (de Iside et Osiride.) For an account of Acron,\r\nsee Fabricii (Biblioth. Græc. xiii, 32); Conringii (Introduct.) and\r\nMangeti (Bibl. Med.) Pliny says of fire as a corrective of the state of\r\nthe atmosphere, “Est et ipsis ignibus medica vis. Pestilentiæ, quæ solis\r\nobscuratione contrahitur, ignis suffitu multiformiter auxiliari, certum\r\nest. Empedocles et Hippocrates id demonstravere diversis locis.” (H. N.\r\nxxxvi, 69.) With the same intention Simeon Seth proposes fumigations\r\nwith frankincense. The historian Herodian relates that fumigations with\r\naromatics were recommended as a preventive of the plague. (i.)\r\n\r\nGalen, in like manner, attributes the origin of epidemics to the state\r\nof the atmosphere in a great measure, but also holds that the nature of\r\nthe country may contribute; as, for example, its vicinity to a gulf like\r\nthe Charonian, from which miasmata are exhaled that taint the air and\r\noccasion diseases. In many passages of his ‘Commentary on the Epidemics’\r\nof Hippocrates, he states that epidemical diseases arise from the\r\ncondition of the country in which they prevail. Lucretius accounts for\r\nthe prevalence of epidemical diseases upon similar principles:\r\n\r\n    “Atque ea vis omnis morborum, pestilitasque,\r\n    Aut extrinsicus, ut nubes nebulæque superne\r\n    Per cœlum veniunt, aut ipsâ sæpe coorta\r\n    _De terrâ surgunt_, ubi putrorem humida nacta est,\r\n    Intempestivis pluviisque, et solibus icta.”\r\n\r\n                              (De Rerum Nat. vi, 1100.)\r\n\r\nSilius Italicus appears to refer an epidemical fever to the same cause.\r\n(xiv.)\r\n\r\nIn his work, on the ‘Varieties of Fever,’ Galen expresses his opinion\r\non this subject very fully. He remarks that an atmosphere of a hot\r\nconstitution, such as generally prevails at the time of the rising of\r\nthe dog-star, having been inhaled by the heart, increases the heat\r\nin it, from which it is diffused all over the system, and enkindles\r\na febrile affection. In pestilential constitutions, he adds, it is\r\nprincipally by the respiration that the disease is contracted, although\r\nsometimes it may arise from the fluids of the body being disposed to\r\nputrescency, which is increased by the condition of the atmosphere; but\r\nfor the most part epidemical complaints derive their origin from the\r\natmosphere being tainted with putrid exhalations. The putridity of the\r\natmosphere may be occasioned either by a multitude of dead bodies which\r\nhave not been burnt, as is apt to happen in wars, or it may arise from\r\nthe exhalations of certain marshes or lakes in the summer season, or\r\nsometimes the inordinate heat of the atmosphere may give rise to them, as\r\nhappened in the case of the Athenian plague, according to the testimony\r\nof Thucydides. And here we must digress to remark, that Homer evidently\r\nascribes the plague which attacked the Grecian army to the great heat of\r\nthe sun. See the Commentary of Eustathius on the beginning of the Iliad;\r\nAmmianus Marcellinus (xix); Heraclides Ponticus (Allegor); and Macrobius\r\n(Saturn. vii, 5.) Galen, however, inculcates that the constitution of the\r\natmosphere alone is not sufficient to produce disease without a peculiar\r\ndisposition of the body to admit it; for that, otherwise, all without\r\nexception would be seized with the prevailing epidemic. This leads him\r\nto give directions to correct the intemperament of the body when it is\r\nsuch as disposes it to be readily affected by the constitution of the\r\natmosphere. His directions are similar to those of our author. Besides\r\nthe causes of epidemical diseases which we have mentioned, he states\r\nthat unwholesome food and drink may sometimes, though rarely, give rise\r\nto them. Of this he relates a striking instance. (De Rebus boni et mali\r\nSucci, c. i.) He remarks that the most common epidemical diseases are\r\npestilential fevers. We shall have occasion to state his opinion of them\r\nin the next Section.\r\n\r\nOf the Greek authors posterior to Galen, Oribasius and Aëtius give the\r\nsame account of epidemical diseases as our author; and the others either\r\ndo not treat of them at all, or class them with the subject of our next\r\nSection.\r\n\r\nAvenzoar has given us an elaborate treatise on epidemical complaints.\r\n(iii.) The first cause of them which he mentions is a humid and warm\r\nstate of the atmosphere, such as that to which Hippocrates ascribed the\r\npestilence which afflicted Thasus in his time. (Epid. iii.) The other\r\ncauses enumerated by him are the effluvia from dead bodies, stagnant air,\r\nthe miasmata from stagnant and corrupted waters, and unwholesome food.\r\n(iii, 3, 1.)\r\n\r\nOn the origin of epidemical diseases, especially the pestilence, see,\r\nin particular, Haly Abbas (Theor. v, 11.) The principal causes of the\r\nchange of the atmosphere to a pestilential state, according to Haly, are\r\nthe nature of the country and the season of the year. The former cause\r\noperates owing to the putrid effluvia arising from corrupted fruit,\r\npot-herbs, &c., or the miasmata from marshes, cloacæ, or dead bodies,\r\nwhether of men or cattle. It was from such causes, he remarks, that\r\nthe plague of Athens derived its origin. The nature of the season, as\r\nit produces diseases in the vegetable, so does it also in the animal\r\ncreation. As epidemical complaints, he mentions ephemerals, cynanche,\r\nsmallpox, acute fevers, and other fatal diseases.\r\n\r\nAvicenna’s account of the origin of pestilential and epidemic diseases\r\nis taken almost entirely from Galen; he therefore enumerates as causes\r\nof them, a humid and warm state of the atmosphere, the stagnant air of\r\ncaverns, the miasmata of lakes and marshes, and the effluvia from dead\r\nbodies. (iv, i, 4.) Alsaharavius enumerates exactly the same causes.\r\n(32.) Rhases’ account is mostly taken from Hippocrates and Galen.\r\n(Contin. xxx.)\r\n\r\nThe historian Ammianus Marcellinus gives an ingenious disquisition on\r\nthe origin of these diseases; but the distinction which he endeavours to\r\nestablish in the following passage is not acknowledged by the medical\r\nauthors in general: “Prima species luis _Pandemus_ appellatur, quæ\r\nefficit in aridioribus locis agentes caloribus crebris interpellari;\r\nsecunda, _Epidemus_ quæ tempore ingruens acies hebetat luminum, et\r\nconcitat periculosos humores; tertia, _Lœmodes_, quæ itidem temporaria\r\nest, sed volucri velocitate letabilis.” (xix, 4.) The causes of these\r\ncomplaints, as enumerated by him, are excessive heat, cold, drought, or\r\nmoisture, effluvia from putrid bodies, and exhalations from the earth.\r\n\r\nAccording to Diodorus Siculus, the causes which gave rise to the\r\npestilential epidemic which attacked the Carthaginian army in Sicily were\r\nthe marshy nature of the country in which they were encamped, the bodies\r\nof the dead lying unburied, and the excessive heat of the season. (xiv.)\r\nHe ascribes the plague of Athens to similar causes. (xii. 58.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXVI.—ON THE PLAGUE, FROM THE WORKS OF RUFFUS.\r\n\r\nIn the plague there is everything which is dreadful, and nothing of this\r\nkind is wanting as in other diseases. For there are delirium, vomitings\r\nof bile, distension of the hypochondrium, pains, much sweatings, cold\r\nof the extremities, bilious diarrhœas, which are thin and flatulent;\r\nthe urine watery, thin, bilious, black, having bad sediments, and the\r\nsubstances floating on it most unfavorable; trickling of blood from\r\nthe nose, heat in the chest, tongue parched, thirst, restlessness,\r\ninsomnolency, strong convulsions, and many other things which are\r\nunfavorable. Should a person foresee that the plague is coming, by\r\nattending to the badness of the season, and the unhealthy occupations of\r\nthe inhabitants, and from observing other animals perishing; when one\r\nobserves these things, let him also observe this—what is the character\r\nof the present season, and what that of the whole year, for you will be\r\nable thereby to find out the best regimen; such, for example, as if the\r\ntemperature of the season ought to have been dry, but has become humid;\r\nin that case, it will be necessary, by a drying diet, to consume the\r\nsuperabundant moisture. Care also must be had of the belly, and when\r\nthere is phlegm in the stomach it must be evacuated by emetics. And when\r\na fulness of blood prevails, a vein should be opened. Purgings also by\r\nurine, and otherwise by the whole body, are proper. But, if the patient\r\nis affected with ardent fever, and has a fiery heat about the breast,\r\nit will not be improper to apply cold things to the breast, and to give\r\ncold drink, not in small quantities, for it only makes the flame burn\r\nmore; but in full draughts, so as to extinguish it. But if an ardent\r\nfever prevails within, and the extremities are cold, and the skin cold,\r\nthe hypochondrium distended, and the stomach sends the matters which\r\nhave been melted, some upwards, and others downwards; if watchfulness,\r\ndelirium, and roughness of the tongue, are present; in these cases,\r\ncalefacient remedies are wanted to diffuse the heat all over the body,\r\nand every other means ought to be tried, in order to determine the heat\r\nfrom the internal to the external parts. The following propoma may be\r\nused: of aloes, two parts; of ammoniac perfume, two parts; of myrrh, one\r\npart; pound these in fragrant wine, and give every day to the quantity\r\nof half a cyathus (ʒv.) I never knew a person, says Ruffus, who did not\r\nrecover from the plague after this draught. So says Ruffus: but Galen\r\nsays, concerning pestilential putrefactions, that to drink Armenian\r\nbole, and, in like manner, the theriac from vipers, is of great service;\r\nand that, in the plague which prevailed in Rome, all died who were not\r\nbenefited by either of these things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. By the plague, as Galen explains in his ‘Commentary on\r\nHippocrates,’ is to be understood an epidemical fever of a fatal nature.\r\nHippocrates has related several histories of diseases which came under\r\nthis description in his ‘Epidemics,’ but they present such variety of\r\nsymptoms, that we cannot undertake to give their general characters. It\r\nis deserving of remark, however, that he several times makes mention of\r\nfevers accompanied with buboes. (Aphor. iv. 54, Epidem. &c.) According to\r\nM. Littré, buboes are noticed among the symptoms of plague by Ruffus, and\r\nalso by Dioscorides and Posidonius in an extract given in the following\r\npublication: ‘Classicorum auctorum e Vaticanis codicibus editorum,’ tomus\r\niv, curante Angelo Maio, p. 11, Romæ, 1834. See Littré’s Hippocrates\r\n(ii, p. 585.) Aretæus mentions incidentally that pestilential buboes\r\nare connected with the liver. (Morb. acut. ii, 3.) Under Sect. XVI will\r\nbe found several passages from ancient authors, in which pestilential\r\nbuboes are incidentally mentioned. It must be admitted they are very\r\ninsufficient materials for illustrating the ancient history of the\r\nglandular plague, and it may justly excite surprise that the historian\r\nProcopius, in the sixth century, P. C., should be the first writer who\r\nhas given a complete description of this disease. At the same time we\r\ncannot agree with M. Nauman, M. Pariset, and other late writers on\r\nthe plague, who maintain that the epidemic which devastated the world\r\nin the reign of Justinian was a new disease. The frequent mention of\r\npestilential buboes by previous authors, although vague, is sufficient to\r\nmark the existence of the disease. In this light, at all events, they are\r\nviewed by the commentators on Hippocrates, who lived after the glandular\r\nplague was properly described. (See Pallad. Comment. in Hippoc. Ep. t.\r\nii, p. 47, ed. Dietz.)\r\n\r\nWe shall now begin our exposition of the ancient opinions regarding the\r\nplague, with a brief notice of the celebrated description of it given by\r\nThucydides, the Greek historian. The more prominent symptoms mentioned by\r\nhim are the following: Strong heat of the head; redness and inflammation\r\nof the eyes; the mouth and internal fauces turgid with blood; breath\r\nfetid; sneezing, hoarseness, and afterwards violent cough; vomiting of\r\nbile, retching, and convulsions; the heat of skin not much increased,\r\nbut the internal parts glowing with heat; the skin reddish, or livid,\r\nand covered with minute phyletænæ and ulcers; despondency, restlessness,\r\nand intense thirst; and, towards the conclusion, diarrhœa, ulceration\r\nof the bowels, and various symptoms of putrefaction. Those who survived\r\nthe febrile attack were subject to blindness, fatuity, and mortification\r\nof the testicles and extremities. The disease generally proved fatal on\r\nthe ninth or seventh day. The historian affirms that the plague never\r\nattacked the same person more than once. This opinion, by the way, has\r\nbeen advocated in modern times by Massarius, Diomedes Amicus, Heurnius,\r\nand Sir William Pym, but general experience seems to be against it.\r\nEvagrius relates of the plague which prevailed in the reign of Justinian,\r\nthat many persons who recovered from the first attack sunk under a\r\nsecond. Ficinus, Montisianus, Joubertus, and many late authorities, hold\r\nthis opinion. He mentions that the disease was supposed to originate in\r\nEthiopia, and from thence to spread to Egypt, Lybia, and the Persian\r\nempire; that in Athens it made its first appearance in the Piræus, where\r\nit was at first suspected that the Peloponnesians had poisoned the\r\nwells. He says the previous summer was remarkably healthy. Thucydides’\r\ncelebrated description of the plague is given in a poetical form by\r\nLucretius (de Rerum Natura, _apud finem_), and by Ovid (Metamorphoseon,\r\nvii, 528.) Sophocles, the tragedian, appears also to have had the same\r\nplague in view. (Œdip. Tyran. _ap. initium_.) The Latin poet Silius\r\nItalicus evidently copies his images from it. (xiv.) See also Lucanus\r\n(Pharsal. vi), and Manilius (Astronom. i.)\r\n\r\nOur next great authority on this subject is Celsus. In his account of\r\nthe plague, we have to regret, however, that, although he dwells rather\r\nminutely on the prophylaxis and treatment, he has omitted to give us a\r\ndescription of the disease; and it is not easy to perceive the principles\r\nupon which some of his directions as to the prophylaxis and treatment are\r\ngiven. He recommends a journey to a distant place, or a sea voyage; when\r\nthis cannot be accomplished, gestation and gentle exercise in the open\r\nair, but he forbids all excess. He also forbids early rising, exercise\r\nwith naked feet after a meal or the bath, also emetics, laxatives, and\r\nsudorifics. He directs people to drink, by turns, first water and then\r\nwine. (i, 10.) With regard to the treatment, he disapproves, in general,\r\nof abstinence and purgative medicines, recommends bleeding, if the\r\nstrength permit, more especially if the fever be attended with pain; but,\r\nif venesection cannot be practised, he directs emetics to be given. At\r\nan earlier period than in ordinary fevers the patient is to be put into\r\nthe bath, and is afterwards to get hot undiluted wine, and everything of\r\na glutinous nature, and flesh of this description. In the case of young\r\npersons, he directs these remedies to be administered with great caution.\r\n(iii, 7.)\r\n\r\nThe historian Appian, Lucian, Pliny, and Plutarch, mention wine as an\r\nantidote to the plague. Livy and other ancient writers say that the\r\nplague is sometimes occasioned by excessive cold. (Histor. v.)\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be regretted that Galen has given us no description\r\nof the dreadful plague which prevailed in his time. It appears that\r\nhe fled from Rome for fear of infection. He alludes to it, indeed, in\r\nseveral parts of his works, but in very brief terms, only mentioning\r\nthat it put on the appearance of dysentery; and in one place he strongly\r\ncommends the celebrated theriac as a most efficacious remedy for the\r\nprevention and cure of pestilential disorders; and elsewhere he speaks\r\nfavorably of the Armenian bole. Of the writers on medicine posterior to\r\nhim, Oribasius and Aëtius, like our author, give no further information\r\non this important subject than what is contained in the brief extract\r\nfrom the works of Ruffus; and the others, with the exception of Nonnus\r\nand Psellus, do not treat of the disease at all, unless in an incidental\r\nmanner. Nonnus, after briefly stating the causes of the plague, proceeds\r\nto lay down the principles for conducting the treatment. He recommends\r\nclysters, and, if the stomach be loaded with phlegm, emetics: if there be\r\na fulness of blood, he approves of venesection; and also speaks well of\r\ngiving diuretics. When symptoms of ardent fever are present, he directs\r\ncold drink to be given freely, in order to extinguish the febrile heat.\r\nHe also recommends apomel, the water of ptisan with the seed of bastard\r\nsaffron, or Armenian bole, or lapis lazuli. Psellus merely mentions, in\r\nvery general terms, a few of the common symptoms of the plague. (Opus\r\nMedicum.) Actuarius, treating of anthrax, mentions that it sometimes take\r\nplace in epidemical affections. (Meth. Med. ii, 36.)\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the Arabian authorities, we shall give a brief\r\nabstract of Procopius’ description of the dreadful plague which desolated\r\nthe Roman empire in the reign of Justinian. Its usual precursors were\r\ncertain delirious fantasies and disturbed dreams, after which the fever\r\nmade its attack suddenly. The early symptoms, however, were not well\r\nmarked, for there was neither increased heat nor discoloration of the\r\nskin, nor did the patient apprehend danger. Generally on the first or\r\nsecond day, but in a few instances somewhat later, buboes appeared not\r\nonly in the groin, but also in the armpits and below the ears. Some were\r\naffected with deep coma, and others with wild delirium. Some died from\r\nsphacelus of the buboes, which, when inspected by the physicians after\r\ndeath, presented the appearance of a _coal_ or _carbuncle_ (anthrax).\r\nSome died at the commencement, and others after the lapse of several\r\ndays. In certain cases the skin was covered over with black phlyctænæ\r\nof the size of a lentil, which were usually succeeded by sudden death.\r\nOthers were unexpectedly cut off by a discharge of blood. To women in the\r\npuerperal state it proved particularly fatal. When the buboes came to a\r\nproper suppuration, they generally proved a favorable crisis; but when\r\nthey did not suppurate, they were commonly followed by a wasting of the\r\nthigh. One of the common consequences of the fever was an affection of\r\nthe organs of speech. All the usual prognostics proved fallacious, and\r\nthe effects of the common remedies were uncertain. In some cases the bath\r\nproved beneficial, and in others it had a contrary effect. At one time\r\nthe amount of deaths in Constantinople ranged from five to ten thousand\r\neach day. (De Bello Pers. 22, 23.) This pestilence is described likewise\r\nby Agathias (v), and by Evagrius (Hist. Eccles. iv, 29.) It resembled the\r\nplague of Avignon, described by Guy of Cauliac.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of the plague, as enumerated by Avicenna, are as follows:\r\nHeat, and strong inflammation within, but which are not perceived\r\noutwardly; respiration large, fetid, and frequent; intense thirst,\r\ndryness of the tongue, with nausea and loss of appetite, such as, if\r\nnot contended against, will prove fatal; enlarged spleen, great anxiety\r\nand restlessness, dry cough, prostration of the powers approaching to\r\nsyncope; delirium, retraction of the hypochondria, insomnolency, with\r\ntepid heat of the body. Sometimes there are yellow, whitish, or red\r\neruptions on the skin, which are of short continuance; or else aphthæ and\r\nulcers in the mouth. The pulse is generally frequent, small, and becomes\r\nstronger towards night. Occasionally there are dropsical swellings.\r\nThe discharges from the bowels are bilious, mixed, fetid, unnatural,\r\nand sometimes contain black bile; at other times they are frothy and\r\nfetid, or unctuous, being produced by melting of the fat. The urine is\r\nwatery, bilious, and melancholic. There is sometimes vomiting of black,\r\nbut more frequently of yellow bile. There are often fetid sweats. The\r\ndisease usually terminates with syncope, coldness of the extremities,\r\nlethargy, spasms, and convulsions. Some of the most fatal varieties of\r\nthe plague are not marked by any striking symptoms, neither the heat,\r\npulse, nor urine being much affected. Fetid breath, as indicating\r\nputrefaction about the heart, is a most mortal symptom. The treatment\r\nmust commence with venesection, if there be a plethora of blood, or\r\nwith purging, if the body be loaded with other humours. The apartments\r\nof the sick are to be cooled, and the air of them corrected: they are\r\nto be cooled by cold odoriferous fruits, camphor, rose-water, or, if\r\npossible, by introducing a stream of water into them. The fetid air may\r\nbe corrected by fumigations with camphor, myrtles, quinces, ebony, &c.;\r\nby sprinkling the apartments with vinegar and assafœtida, and correcting\r\nthe putridity with lignum aloes, frankincense, musk, storax, _sandarach_,\r\nmastich, juniper, bays, and the like. (It may be proper to mention that\r\narsenical fumigations are approved of by Muratori, Lind, and Russel, but\r\ncondemned by Mead.) As a preservative from the plague, he recommends,\r\nin particular, exercise and restricted diet. Haly evidently copies his\r\ndescription. (Theor. v, 11.)\r\n\r\nRhases agrees with Hippocrates in stating, that pestilential fevers are\r\ndistinguished by great heat internally, while the surface of the body is\r\ncool. The symptoms, as detailed by him, are vomiting and diarrhœa, pain\r\nand distension of the belly, coldness of the extremities, urine showing\r\na tendency to putrefaction, discharge of blood from the nose, heat about\r\nthe breast, singultus tendinum, blackness of the tongue, bulimia, &c.\r\nHe particularly states that a black discharge from the bowels is a most\r\nfatal symptom. Like Avicenna, he gives directions to perform fumigations\r\nwith camphor, musk, myrrh, bdellium, frankincense, and the like. He\r\nmentions that, during the prevalence of a certain pestilence, it was\r\nfound that hunters escaped the contagion. Like Avicenna, he approves of\r\nbloodletting. See Continens (xxx.) He also recommends cold drink and the\r\ncold bath. Calefacients and wine, unless diluted with much cold water, he\r\ndisapproves of. He, like the other Arabian authorities, joins Galen in\r\nspeaking favorably of Armenian bole and the theriac. (Ad Mansor. iv, 25.)\r\n\r\nThe belief that the plague is preceded by extraordinary phenomena in the\r\nearth and sky is very ancient. Thucydides concludes his brief account of\r\nthe last attack of the plague on Athens with the remark, that at that\r\ntime there were many earthquakes at Athens and other places. (iii, 87.)\r\nManilius says such plagues as that of Athens are commonly prognosticated\r\nby comets and other celestial fires. Diodorus Siculus mentions that the\r\nAthenian plague was preceded by earthquakes of extraordinary severity.\r\n(xii, 59.)\r\n\r\nWhile explaining the symptoms and treatment of the plague, as detailed in\r\nthe works of the ancient authors, we have purposely omitted to notice its\r\ncontagious nature, as we wished to give one connected view of the ancient\r\nopinions regarding CONTAGION. Before entering upon this disquisition,\r\nwe think it proper to acknowledge the assistance which we have derived\r\nfrom the writings of Fracastorius, Paulinus, Mead, Marx, Omodei, and\r\nWinterbottom, leaving it to the reader to determine, after comparing our\r\nhumble attempt with their learned labours, whether or not our industry\r\nand research have contributed in anywise to throw additional light upon\r\nthis important subject.\r\n\r\nThe earlier ancient authors appear to have entertained no suspicions\r\nof contagion as a cause of febrile or of other complaints. Homer,\r\nas formerly stated, evidently refers the origin of the plague which\r\nprevailed in the Grecian army during the siege of Troy to the heat of the\r\nsun. The works of the fathers of History and of Medicine have likewise\r\nbeen ransacked in vain, for any traces of the doctrine of contagion.\r\nThucydides, therefore, appears to be the first author (if we except the\r\nMosaic description of leprosy) who makes any positive allusion to the\r\ncontagious nature of diseases. From his description of the plague of\r\nAthens, there can be no doubt that he wishes it to be understood, that\r\nthe disease was transmitted from one person to another; for he mentions\r\nthat physicians were more attacked by it than any others, as having most\r\nintercourse with the sick; and he afterwards describes the terror which\r\nthe citizens felt to approach those labouring under the disease, and\r\nintimates that it was often contracted by such intercourse. The language\r\nof Lucretius, who copies his description, and gives it a poetical form,\r\nis still more precise:—\r\n\r\n    “——nullo cessabant tempore apisci\r\n    Ex aliis alios avidi contagia morbi.”\r\n\r\n                               (L. 1235.)\r\n\r\nAnd afterwards,\r\n\r\n    “Qui fuerant autem præsto contagibus ibant.”\r\n\r\n                                      (L. 1241.)\r\n\r\nOvid, in like manner, says of the dead bodies:\r\n\r\n    “Afflatuque nocent et agunt contagia latè.”\r\n\r\n                               (Metam. v, 551.)\r\n\r\nAnd so also, Silius Italicus:\r\n\r\n    “Et posuere avidæ mortis contagia pestes.”\r\n\r\n                                   (Lib. xiv.)\r\n\r\nThe historians we must dismiss in a few words, with stating that\r\nallusions to the infectious nature of certain diseases are to be met\r\nwith in Livy, Dionysius the Halicarnassian, Diodorus Siculus, Appian,\r\nPlutarch, Quintus Curtius, Dio Cassius, Eusebius, Gregory of Nyssa, and\r\nEvagrius. Procopius was a non-contagionist.\r\n\r\nThe philosopher Aristotle, in one of his problems, makes it a question\r\nwhy the plague is the only disease which infects those who approach the\r\nsick. (Probl. i.) There is a curious passage in the works of the orator\r\nIsocrates, which shows that consumption was reckoned contagious in his\r\ndays. (Æginet.) The elder Pliny mentions the contagion of the pestilence.\r\n(Hist. Nat. xxxiii, 80.)\r\n\r\nVirgil mentions the infectious nature of certain diseases of cattle.\r\n(Ecl. i, Georg. iii, 464.) The ancient writers on veterinary surgery and\r\nagriculture in like manner state that the plague and scabies of cattle\r\nare infectious. See Columella (vi, 5); Vegetius (Mulomed. iii, 23.)\r\n\r\nThe philosopher Marcus Antoninus alludes to the plague as being\r\ncontagious. (ix, 2.) Chrysostom does the same. (In Joan. Orat. lvii.) The\r\nlanguage of Seneca is very precise: “Itaque ut in pestilentiâ cavendum\r\nest ne corruptis jam corporibus et morbo flagrantibus assideamus, quia\r\npericula trahemus, afflatuque ipso laborabimus.” (De Tranquil. vii.) To\r\nthese we may join Isidorus Hispalensis, a much later writer: “Pestilentia\r\nest contagium quod quum unum apprehenderit celeriter ad plures transit.”\r\nAnd, in another place: “Pestilentia est morbus latè vagans et contagio\r\nsuo quæ contigerit interimens.” Alexander Aphrodisiensis intimates that\r\npestilential fevers are contagious, but common fevers not so. (Probl. ii,\r\n42.)\r\n\r\nAretæus appears to be the first medical author who alludes to contagion\r\nin unequivocal terms. He says of elephantiasis, that it is as infectious\r\nas the plague, being communicated by respiration. Cælius Aurelianus,\r\nwho was probably nearly contemporary with him, mentions as contagious\r\ndiseases the plague, incubus, hydrophobia, and elephantiasis. Galen\r\nexpresses his sentiments on the contagious nature of certain diseases\r\nin the following terms: “That a pestilential state of the atmosphere\r\nproduces fever, is unknown to no one possessed of good understanding;\r\nand, also, that it is dangerous to associate with persons having the\r\nplague, for there is a risk of catching it, like the itch and ophthalmy.\r\nIt is dangerous also to live with those labouring under consumption, and,\r\nin a word, with all those having a putrid respiration of such a nature\r\nas to render the houses in which they lie fetid.” (De Diff. Febr. i, 3.)\r\nAëtius (xiii, 120) and our author (iv, i) state their decided opinion\r\nof the infectious nature of the plague and elephantiasis. Oribasius,\r\nAlexander, Synesius, Palladius, Actuarius, and all the Latin medical\r\nauthors, with the exception of Cælius Aurelianus, have omitted to make\r\nany allusion to the contagious nature of diseases.\r\n\r\nOf the Arabians, Rhases mentions, as diseases “which are transmitted from\r\none person to another,” lepra (elephantiasis?), itch, consumption, and\r\npestilential fever. These, he says, prove infectious, when one is shut up\r\nin a narrow house along with those labouring under them, or when one sits\r\nin the wind blowing from them. He states afterwards that ophthalmy and\r\nmalignant pustules are sometimes contagious. (Ad Mansor. iv, 24; see also\r\nContin. xxxiii, 5.) By malignant pustules he means the smallpox. Avicenna\r\nand Haly Abbas give the same list of contagious diseases. Avicenna says\r\nthat smallpox and measles are of all diseases the most contagious. Of the\r\nother Arabians, Avenzoar alone, while treating of elephantiasis, alludes\r\nto the doctrine of contagion.\r\n\r\nHaving now done with the ancient authorities, we shall only give further\r\nthe declaration of the celebrated Boccacio regarding the plague of\r\nFlorence: “E fu questa pestilenza di maggior forza, percio che essa dagl’\r\ninfermi di quella per lo communicare insieme s’avventava a’ sani non\r\naltramenti che faccia il fuoco alle cose secche o unte, quando molto gli\r\nsono avvicinate.” (Decameron, Introduzione.)\r\n\r\nThe result of our investigations into the opinions of the ancients on\r\nthis subject leads us to the conclusion, that all, or at least the\r\nmost intelligent of the medical authorities, held that the plague is\r\ncommunicated, not by any specific virus, but in consequence of the\r\natmosphere around the sick being contaminated with putrid effluvia.\r\nHence, they maintained that mild fevers (συνηθεῖς) which show no\r\ntendency to putrescency are not communicable from one person to another.\r\nSee Alexander Aphrodisiensis, (_l. c._) Fracastorius, in like manner,\r\nconsidered putrefaction as the source of all contagion. (De Contag.\r\ni); and nearly the same opinion was maintained by the learned Fernel,\r\nFranciscus de Pedemont, Ingrassius, Ficinus, and others. (See Prælect.\r\nMar. 77.) Although Galen several times speaks of a poison being formed\r\nin the human body, he means that the animal fluids are so altered as to\r\nbecome deleterious, and does not hold that there is any specific virus\r\ntransmitted from one person to another. (De Loc. Affect. v, 7, vi, 5;\r\nEpidem. iii.)\r\n\r\nWe may take this opportunity of stating that, after a pretty extensive\r\ninvestigation into the histories of pestilential epidemics, we have come\r\nto the conclusion that the plague has almost invariably assumed one or\r\nother of the following phases: 1st. That of cholera and dysentery. The\r\nplague described by Thucydides, and that of Ingrassias, and many other\r\npestilential epidemics described in ancient and modern times, including\r\nthe Asiatic cholera of the present age, belong to this class. 2d. That of\r\nprofuse; and, as they have been termed, syncoptic sweats. The celebrated\r\nepidemic of the fifteenth century, now so admirably illustrated by M.\r\nHecker, is the best marked instance which we possess of this form of\r\nthe disease. M. Hecker, indeed, supposes that the Cardiac disease of\r\nthe ancients was of a similar nature to the sweating sickness. But it\r\nstrikes us (although we must admit that we have not had time to consider\r\nthis point maturely), that the syncoptic fever or cardiac disease of the\r\nancients, was not of a pestilential nature. 3d. The other form is the\r\nGlandular plague, which many late authorities would consider as the only\r\nform of the disease; but as we think erroneously, since the other types\r\nare often mixed up with this in the same epidemic. Thus in the plague\r\nof Aleppo, during the years 1760, 1761, and 1762, although the ordinary\r\nform of the disease was the glandular, a considerable proportion of the\r\ncases assumed the first form which we have noticed. And in the plague of\r\nAthens, although it commonly put on the appearance of the first form, it\r\nwould appear probable, from the obscure allusion to cutaneous eruptions\r\nin the description of Thucydides, that a certain proportion of the cases\r\nwere of the second type. The three forms then would appear to us to be\r\nas closely allied to one another as diphtherite, ulcerous sore-throat,\r\nand scarlatina are; that is to say, that they are all varieties of one\r\nspecies of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXVII.—ON THE TREATMENT OF THOSE WHO ARE SEIZED WITH SYNCOPE FROM\r\nCRUDE HUMOURS.\r\n\r\nSome are seized with fever while having a great collection of crude\r\nhumours, and while the mouth of the stomach is at the same time\r\ndisordered. In them the hypochondrium is distended with flatulence,\r\nthe orifice of the stomach is more swelled than natural; in some the\r\ncomplexion is turned to a more white and watery, and in others to a\r\nblacker. None of these can bear the abstraction of blood without the\r\nmost imminent danger; but they require evacuation, although they cannot\r\nendure phlebotomy nor purging, for even without them they are disposed\r\nto fall suddenly into a state of syncope. They are to be cured, then, by\r\nfriction. It will be proper, at the commencement of the disease, to begin\r\nwith rubbing the limbs from above, downwards, with moderately rough linen\r\ncloths, and afterwards, the whole arms from above, downwards. But when\r\nthe limbs have been sufficiently warmed, and there is danger of a sense\r\nof lassitude, we must use a relaxing oil, and avoid all astringents. When\r\nit is winter, we must also use a sudorific one, such as the Sicyonian\r\noil, or that of chamomile. After rubbing the limbs freely, we must next\r\nrub off the oil, and proceed to the spine, which we must rub in like\r\nmanner, and then immediately return to the legs, and from them to the\r\narms again, and afterwards to the spine again, continuing this practice\r\nfor a whole day. Honied water, in which hyssop has been boiled, is most\r\nbeneficial in these cases. And they must neither get farinaceous food,\r\nnor soup, nor water, nor be permitted at all to drink freely; but they\r\nought to be contented with honied water alone for the first three days,\r\nand be rubbed in succession. If the strength be moderately good, and the\r\ncontents of the stomach do not pass properly downwards, you may venture\r\nwith a clyster. But if there is a greater overflow of the superfluities\r\nthan proper upon the stomach, you must first boil the honied water well,\r\nfor thus it will be less laxative; but when the belly is looser than\r\nproper, you must not thus stop it, but, instead of the honied water,\r\ngive the juice of ptisan. But if the discharge still continue, we must\r\nsupport with a gruel made from chondrus. But if we ascertain from the\r\nweakness of the pulse that the powers of the system are prostrated, it\r\nwill be proper to give bread out of diluted wine, provided there be no\r\ninflammation of the stomach or liver. But should they be inflamed at the\r\nsame time that the body is loaded with crude humours, the state of the\r\npatient is hopeless. If you perceive that the humours are thick, give\r\noxymel always instead of honied water; if it is summer, the patient hot,\r\nand fond of cold drink, give him cold oxymel; but when in winter, it must\r\nbe hot. Baths are most prejudicial to such persons. If, when you are\r\ncalled, syncope has already come on, and the parts which I have mentioned\r\nare free from inflammation, give a small bit of bread out of wine, and\r\nproceed straightway to the friction in the manner I have described. In\r\nthose cases in which the syncope is occasioned by yellow bile infesting\r\nthe mouth of the stomach, we must give cold drink, and administer wine\r\nthat is thin, of a bright yellow colour, and old.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken either from Oribasius (Synops. vi, 27),\r\nor Aëtius (v, 97.) These authors, however, merely abridge the account of\r\nthis subject which is given by Galen. (Meth. Med. xii, 5, and Therap. ad\r\nGlauc. i.) Syncope, according to the explanation of Galen, is a sudden\r\nprostration of the vital powers, without suspension of the respiration,\r\nas in _deliquium animi_. Our author has given a very correct account of\r\nGalen’s treatment. He states that, the system labouring under a load,\r\nthe great indication is evacuation, but that venesection cannot be borne\r\nin such cases. In short, he insists that our great dependence must be\r\nplaced on friction, for the application of which he gives very minute\r\ndirections. When the pulse suddenly sinks and becomes irregular, he\r\nadministers wine, unless there be inflammation of the stomach or liver.\r\nIn cases complicated with crude humours, he pronounces the bath to be\r\nmost prejudicial, and also disapproves of very cold or very warm air. He\r\nis most particular in his directions for the selection of the most proper\r\nwine to be used, and gives some interesting observations on the principal\r\nGreek and Roman wines used in his time. He concludes his remarks with\r\nstating that thick wines ought to be avoided as injurious, and such as\r\nare watery and thin as ineffectual, whereas those of a middling kind are\r\nto be selected. He particularly praises the Ariusian and the Lesbian. The\r\nFalernian he condemns, as being too fragrant and austere, which qualities\r\nrender it injurious to the head.\r\n\r\nAlexander disagrees with Galen as to several of the points of treatment\r\nlaid down by him. He insists that Galen’s rigid rules for applying strong\r\nfriction, at the same time that abstinence is enjoined, are such as no\r\nordinary powers of constitution could bear up under; and, therefore, he\r\nrecommends to rub first, and then to give some light nourishment, such\r\nas thin ptisan, oxymel, and bread soaked in wine, when the strength is\r\ngreatly overpowered. Nay, when the powers of the constitution are in\r\ndanger of sinking under the weight of the load, he suggests the propriety\r\nof having recourse to venesection; and accounts for the benefit derived\r\nfrom this evacuation upon the same principle that a fire which is like to\r\nbe extinguished by an excessive load of green fuel burns brighter when\r\npart is taken off. This is an ingenious explanation of the manner in\r\nwhich bleeding proves useful in cases of congestive fevers. Respecting\r\nthe use of wine and the bath, his views are similar to those of Galen. He\r\napproves very much of administering a light-coloured diffusible wine when\r\nthe powers of the system are much sunk.\r\n\r\nAvicenna adheres closely to the principles of treatment laid down by\r\nGalen; and, therefore, says nothing of venesection. (iv, 1, 2, 58.)\r\nRhases treats this complication of fever in like manner. He calls it\r\n“Febris syncoptica, ex humorum copiâ et cruditate nata.” (Ad Mansor. x,\r\n14.) He mentions emetics, but approves most particularly of friction.\r\n(Contin. xxx.)\r\n\r\nAverrhoes contends that, in such a case, it is lawful for a Mussulman\r\nto drink wine, although forbidden by the Prophet. He approves also of\r\nfriction. (Collig. vii, 16.)\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus informs us that the Methodists, in such cases, gave wine\r\nand aromatics, and used every means to rouse the system. (Med. Method,\r\nvi, 9.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXVIII.—OF THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN INTO SYNCOPE FROM THIN HUMOURS.\r\n\r\nThose who have fallen into a state of syncope from thin humours, must be\r\ntreated quite oppositely to the manner described, for you will find the\r\ndiagnostic symptoms quite different. They must be supported by taking a\r\nlittle food frequently. And their case is to be thought hopeless when the\r\nliver or stomach is inflamed at the same time that the powers are gone.\r\nIn these affections, the expression of the countenance speedily becomes\r\ndeath-like. It is necessary to support their strength with food, but\r\ntheir skin must be condensed instead of being rarefied as in the former\r\ncase. The air must be cooled, and they must be rubbed with astringent\r\nointments. They must be furnished with food not very laxative, also bread\r\nand gruels from chondrus, with autumnal fruits that are austere, and not\r\napt to spoil; these, either by themselves or with bread. A watery wine\r\ntaken from the beginning with the food will be beneficial.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is taken from Galen. (Meth. Med. xii, 6.) See also\r\nOribasius (Synops. vi, 27); Aëtius (v, 98.) In this case Alexander\r\nrecommends nearly the same plan of treatment as Galen. He recommends for\r\nfood things which are incrassant and anti-discutient, such as the juice\r\nof halica, succory, lettuces, apples, pomegranates, pears, &c. They must\r\nbe administered, however, in small quantities. He approves of giving a\r\nweak watery wine, not very old. He recommends friction with tonic and\r\nincrassant oils, such as the oil of apples, and other applications of a\r\nlike nature.\r\n\r\nAvicenna, Averrhoes, and Rhases treat the case exactly as our author.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXIX.—ON THE OTHER CAUSES WHICH OCCASION SYNCOPE.\r\n\r\nThere are four other causes from which men fall into syncope; namely,\r\nviolent pain, watchfulness, too great evacuation, and sometimes motion\r\nwhen in a state of delirium. To these, if you please, you may add a\r\nfifth, namely, an intemperament of the primary organs. Death takes place\r\nmost quickly when the heart is affected, next, when the brain, but not so\r\nwhen the liver.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See, in like manner, Galen (Meth. Med. xii, 7); Oribasius\r\n(Synops. vi, 28); Aëtius (v, 99.)\r\n\r\nFrom the Commentaries on the last three Sections it will be seen that\r\nGalen and his followers, whether Greek or Arabian, consider syncope in\r\nthe light of a symptom or complication of fever. But it is treated of\r\nas a distinct disease by Celsus, Cælius Aurelianus, and Aretæus; by the\r\nformer two under the name of _morbus cardiacus_, and by the last under\r\nthat of _syncope_. We think ourselves called upon in this place to give a\r\nbrief exposition of their views.\r\n\r\nCelsus treats of _morbus cardiacus_ after phrenitis, because, as he\r\nsays, persons affected with phrenitis are apt to fall into the other. He\r\ncalls it a great weakness of the body, which, owing to the languid state\r\nof the stomach, is melted by immoderate sweating. It is recognized by\r\na small and weak pulse, immoderate sweats, breaking out from the chest\r\nand neck, the feet and legs alone being dry and cold. He adds, it is a\r\nsort of acute disease. His treatment consists in applying a repressing\r\ncataplasm to the præcordia, and next, in stopping the sweats by friction\r\nwith sour oil, roses, &c., or with some cerate similarly prepared. If the\r\nsweating gains ground, the body is to be anointed with parget, litharge,\r\nCimolian earth, or sprinkled with the powder of them. The patient is to\r\nbe lightly covered, laid in a place not too warm, with open windows, so\r\nthat a current of air may reach him. Light food is to be frequently\r\nadministered, and also, if necessary, wine neither too strong nor too\r\nweak, which may be given with barley-meal, if the patient has not taken\r\nother food. If he cannot take food, he is to be first treated with the\r\naffusion of cold water; and if his stomach have lost its tone, he is to\r\nbe allowed to vomit before taking food. If the stomach still reject the\r\nfood, he is first to take a cupful of wine, which is to be repeated after\r\nan hour, and then the whole body is to be anointed with pounded bulbi\r\n(onions?), which will have the effect of making the stomach retain the\r\nwine, and thereby heat will be restored to the whole body and strength\r\nto the veins. As a last resource, he recommends an injection of ptisan\r\nor gruel. Fragrant things may also be applied to the nose, such as roses\r\nand wine; and if the extremities be cold, they are to be chafed with hot\r\nhands smeared with oil. If the violence of the sweating be thus checked,\r\nand life prolonged, the time thus gained will be of some assistance.\r\nMeans are afterwards to be taken to prevent a relapse. (iii, 19.)\r\n\r\nCælius, the Methodist, treats so fully of the _cardiac passion_,\r\nthat we feel at a loss how to give a competent outline of it within\r\nour limits. The followers of Asclepiades, he says, held it to be a\r\nswelling about the heart, connected with congestion; but, according to\r\nSoranus, the great master of the Methodists, the heart is not primarily\r\naffected; and he holds it to be an acute and sudden prostration, by\r\nwhich the distribution of particles over the passages of the body is\r\nstopped. The causes of it are many; such as protracted indigestion,\r\nintoxication, baths after food, vomiting after supper, and depressing\r\npassions, by which the body is dissolved into sweats. It takes place\r\nmost frequently, he says, in continual, ardent, and inflammatory fevers\r\non the sixth day. His description is too lengthy to find a place here.\r\nSuffice it to say that when the affection is at its height, the pulse is\r\nsmall, tremulous, and creeping; there is a profuse, viscid, and fœtid\r\nsweat over the chest, face, and perhaps the whole body, with failing\r\nrespiration, pallid countenance, hollow eyes, and so forth. Some of the\r\npreceding authorities, such as Asclepiades and Themison, held that it was\r\ngenerally, but not always attended with fever; and with them he pretty\r\nnearly agrees. As we have already hinted, he is not disposed to admit\r\nthat it is a primary affection of the heart, but rather holds it to be\r\na disorder of the general system. Having discussed, in two chapters,\r\nthe diagnosis, first, between it and affection of the stomach, and then\r\nbetween it and critical sweats, he comes to the treatment. The patient\r\nis to be laid in a cool and well-ventilated apartment, to be covered\r\nover with light clothes, and to have his face, neck, and chest sponged\r\nwith cold water and vinegar; and if the sweating continue, astringents\r\nand obstruents, such as alum and Samian earth, are to be added; or the\r\nbody may be anointed with astringent oils; but, in particular, various\r\napplications of a fragrant and astringent nature are to be made to the\r\nchest. He recommends great caution in the administration of food and\r\ndrink; directs that the mouth should be rinsed with something cooling;\r\nand, in process of time, that various articles of a restorative nature\r\nshould be given for food, and at last, wine, about the choice of which\r\nhe is very scrupulous, approving, in general terms, of such as is white,\r\nwell clarified, and subaustere, and in particular of the Surrentine,\r\nthe Falernian, the Chian, and the Lesbian. He cautions, however, not to\r\ngive too much at a time. When there is great prostration of the vital\r\npowers, he approves of ligatures to the extremities, and the application\r\nof cupping instruments, with great heat to the præcordia. When all other\r\nmeans fail, the patient is to be supported by administering nourishing\r\nthings in clysters. Such is his own mode of treatment. He afterwards\r\nanimadverts freely upon the practice of the other sects.\r\n\r\nAlthough Aretæus treats of syncope as a separate disease, he holds that\r\nit derives its origin from causus, or ardent fever. He pronounces it to\r\nbe a loosening of the vital cords, and that its seat is the heart; hence\r\nhis chapter on the treatment is entitled, on the cure of _cardiacs_.\r\nThe symptoms, he holds, mark an affection of the heart, namely, small\r\nand weak pulse, great palpitation, throbbing of the heart, fainting,\r\nunrestrainable sweats, &c.\r\n\r\nHis treatment is little different from that of Alexander in\r\nsyncoptic fever. Thus he begins with venesection, unless otherwise\r\ncontra-indicated, justifying this practice by the pithy remark that\r\nthe powers of the system may be reduced by suffocation as well as by\r\nwant. He recommends, however, that blood should be taken in moderation,\r\nand that some wine should be given immediately afterwards, unless\r\ninflammation be present. Wine, he remarks, in inflammations, adds to\r\nthe disease, but, in ordinary cases, to the strength. When general\r\nbleeding cannot be borne, he advises cupping in a guarded manner. He\r\napproves of bathing the head with cooling things, of cool air, and of\r\nall things that are grateful to the senses. When the system is quite\r\nsunk, and the extremities cold, he recommends wine guardedly with light\r\nsoups. The wine, he says, should be fragrant and not very astringent,\r\nbut should be given with moderation, unless the sweats are very profuse\r\nand the skin cold, when he advises wine to be given to any extent, wine\r\nin such cases being the last hope of life. He directs further that the\r\npatient should be kept up with encouraging words, and the application of\r\nfragrant and astringent things, such as alum, rose-water, and the like.\r\nHe is to be exposed to fragrant and cool air, and, if the sweats persist,\r\nobstruent substances, such as Samian earth, &c., are to be added to the\r\napplications, and a sponge soaked in cold water is to be applied to the\r\nface. Stimulants and rubefacients are to be applied to the extremities.\r\nHe concludes with remarking that convalescence is often prevented by\r\nlatent inflammations, which end in marasmus, in which cases the physician\r\nmust endeavour by gestation, friction, baths, and the administration\r\neither of a woman’s milk or that of an ass to support the strength. (De\r\nCur. Acut. ii, 3.)\r\n\r\nAëtius also has a separate chapter on _cardiacs_, although he holds\r\nsyncope to be symptomatic of acute fever. We need not enter upon an\r\nexposition of his views further than to mention that he is of opinion\r\nthat the part originally affected is the cardiac orifice of the stomach.\r\n(ix, 1.)\r\n\r\nBy _cardiac disease_ in fevers the ancients would seem to have meant\r\nto describe a febrile affection, attended with congestion and great\r\nnausea. Such a variety of remittent fever is described by the late Dr.\r\nRobert Jackson as still occurring in warm climates. The symptoms are\r\ngreat nausea, sluggishness, obscure, weak pulse, and deep respiration.\r\nHe recommends bleeding, and afterwards stimulant applications to the\r\nextremities. (On Fever, p. 193.)\r\n\r\nSince writing the above we have had an opportunity of consulting Hecker’s\r\n‘Epidemics of the Middle Ages,’ and beg to refer our readers to it (p.\r\n306) for an ingenious disquisition on the cardiac disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XL.—ON PAIN.\r\n\r\nA torpid pain is occasioned by a cold affection; a throbbing is\r\ncharacteristic of a strong inflammation. But, if a person feel as if\r\npierced by a sharp-pointed instrument, or bored by a wimble, this kind of\r\npain is peculiar to the thick intestine, i. e. the _colon_. The pungent\r\nis seated in the membranes. The darting pain attends the most vehement\r\nattacks, not only of hemicrania, but also of cephalæa. It is said to be\r\ndarting when it commences in the seat of the affection, as from a root,\r\nand spreads quickly to the surrounding parts. Stretching pains take\r\nplace in the nerves, when they are affected and stretched towards both\r\nextremities. But the nerves are not liable to be affected with lateral\r\ndistensions. The membrane under the skin when distended occasions tensive\r\nand torpid pains; those between the flesh, as it were, divellent. For\r\nthey are many, have irregular insertions, and surround the flesh. But\r\nthe pains proceeding from the membranes which surround the bone, are\r\ndeep-seated, and seem to proceed from the bones themselves. Wherefore,\r\nwhen no external cause of the pain is apparent, you must consider the\r\npatient’s preceding regimen. If it has been more inactive than usual,\r\nor if he has been taking more nutritive food than common, or if any\r\nevacuation has been suppressed,—if any or all of these circumstances be\r\nobserved, plethora is the cause of the pain, and you must evacuate him\r\nas quickly as possible; for, by this means you will be enabled with all\r\nsafety to use such remedies as are fitted to repel the defluxions from\r\nthe affected parts. If the part be distended with a fulness of blood,\r\nopen a large vein near it immediately; but when bad humours alone are the\r\ncause, you must purge; and, when both meet together, you must use both\r\nevacuations, beginning with the bleeding. If, after both these remedies\r\nhave been tried, the pain continue, it is clear that the offending matter\r\nhas become fixed in the part affected; and it is also clear, that the\r\ncure will be accomplished by discutient remedies. In like manner, we may\r\ncure pains from flatulence, by soothing them with attenuant food and\r\ninjections, and opening the pores of the containing part with cataplasms,\r\nirrigations, and fomentations. If a swelling bearing down and pressing\r\nupon the part be the cause of the pain, it must be removed; but, if it\r\nproceed from a pungent humour, attenuant and calefacient things are most\r\nimproper. Dill boiled in oil is anodyne and soporific, and the green more\r\nthan the dry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius (Synops. vi, 29), or\r\nAëtius (v, 100.) All these authors, however, merely abridge the account\r\ngiven by Galen. (Meth. Med. xii, 8, and de Locis Affect. ii.) In the\r\nlatter work he gives a most ingenious dissertation on the different kinds\r\nof pain, and the states of the body in which they occur; but, as our\r\nauthor has given a summary of his observations, we think it unnecessary\r\nto go over the same ground. We shall, therefore, merely notice some\r\nof his remarks on the treatment, as delivered in the other work. When\r\nthe pain is connected with flatulence, it is to be removed by food,\r\ndrink, cataplasms, and fomentations of an attenuant nature. When pungent\r\nhumours are the cause of the pain, they are to be treated by evacuants,\r\ndiluents, or narcotics. When occasioned by thick and viscid humours,\r\nhe forbids narcotics, the action of which, being frigorific, renders\r\nthem thicker, and the containing parts more compact. In all such cases,\r\ntherefore, he holds that opium and hyoscyamus, although they afford a\r\ntemporary relief from pain, act prejudicially. He also proscribes things\r\nof a very hot nature, both internally and externally, and recommends\r\nto give attenuants, or things of an incisive nature. He in particular\r\ncommends garlic, which he calls the theriac of rustics. As to external\r\napplications, he directs, in febrile cases, first a dry fomentation of\r\nmillet-seeds, and, if it is not successful, friction with subtile or\r\nattenuant oils, and the fat of fowls.\r\n\r\nAëtius defines pain to be a sensation produced by a sudden change\r\nof temperament, or a solution of continuity. In illustration of the\r\nformer cause, he remarks that all sudden changes from heat to cold, or\r\n_vice versa_, occasion severe pains. To the latter he refers rupture,\r\ncontusion, and erosion of the parts. Rupture is produced by tension,\r\ncontusion by weight, and erosion by some pungent quality. These causes\r\nof pain ought to be particularly attended to, and the treatment modified\r\naccordingly. His subsequent account is exactly the same as our author’s.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of pain are fully treated of by Avicenna (i, 2,\r\n3, 20), and by Haly Abbas (Theor. vi, 16.) Averrhoes has delivered\r\nthe treatment of this complication of fever in nearly the same terms\r\nas Galen. When the pain is occasioned by warm air or flatulence, he\r\nparticularly commends cupping applied with great heat. He agrees with\r\nGalen in condemning narcotics, when the exciting cause is of a cold\r\nnature. He also joins him in condemning hot fomentations and clysters,\r\nwhen the pain of the bowels is occasioned by a hot humour. (Collig. vii,\r\n18.) See Rhases (Cont. xxxiii.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLI.—ON COLLIQUATIVE DIARRHŒA OR MELTING.\r\n\r\nWhen anything is discharged from the bowels which was not part of the\r\nfood or drink that was taken, but of the fluids of the body which\r\nhad flowed to them, (resembling the yellow bile which is continually\r\ndischarged by vomiting and purging, but differing from it in fetor;\r\nand in this, that the alvine discharge is of a darker yellow, of the\r\nconsistence of the sordes balneorum, oily, and adipose,) the disease is\r\ncalled colliquation or melting. At first the fat and newly-made flesh\r\nare dissolved and melted by the heat of the fever; but as the evil is\r\nprotracted, some of the solid parts themselves are melted down. In this\r\nmost unfavorable state of fever, a draught of cold water from the coolest\r\nfountain is the most proper remedy; likewise cold cataplasms and epithems\r\nought to be applied to the chest and hypochondriac regions, and cooling\r\nfood to be given.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen mentions that a colliquative discharge from the bowels\r\nwas a common symptom of the fatal plague which prevailed in his time.\r\nHe adds that the fæces were generally of a deep yellow colour, and\r\nalways fetid. (Comment. in Hippocrat. Epidem. iii.) In another place, he\r\nstates that it is a fatal practice to bleed or purge in cases of fever\r\ncomplicated with diarrhœa. (Therap. ad Glauc. i.)\r\n\r\nOur author borrows from Oribasius (Synops. vi, 30), or Aëtius (v, 91.)\r\n\r\nThe Arabians treat febrile melting upon general principles, as explained\r\nunder the head of Diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nOn the colliquative diarrhœa in fevers, see, further, Prosper Alpinus (de\r\nPræs. Vita et Morte Ægrot. vii, 11), and Fabius Paulinus (Prælect. Marc.\r\np. 343.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLII.—ON WATCHFULNESS IN FEVERS.\r\n\r\nThose who are much troubled with insomnolency, we are to direct to\r\nhave their legs and hands bound with ligatures at the time when they\r\nwere accustomed to go to rest; and make them keep their eyelids open,\r\nor wink, until they are sufficiently fatigued; then we suddenly loosen\r\nthe ligatures, remove the lamp, and order complete stillness to be\r\npreserved. But, when the insomnolency is obstinate, we must bathe the\r\nforehead during the decline of the paroxysm with the decoction of the\r\nheads of the black poppy, and direct the patient to snuff up the dried\r\nand powdered husk of the white poppy; or from the root of the mandragora\r\npounded with wine and rose oil in equal quantities, we make an emollient\r\nointment (_malagma_), and smear the forehead with it. Or we use, during\r\nthe paroxysms, wild thyme boiled in must with melilot. Or, taking the\r\npounded heads of poppies, we make a cataplasm of it with bread and rose\r\noil, or cerate. And the greatest attention ought to be paid to the food.\r\nLet about three spoonfuls of the seeds of the white poppy be added to the\r\npatient’s gruels; and let his pot-herbs be prepared by adding to them\r\nas many of the leaves of the black poppy, if green, as can be contained\r\nwithin three fingers; or otherwise, three or four dried heads may be\r\nboiled with them and taken. If, even by these means, sleep cannot be\r\nprocured, let him be smeared with the juice of poppy or of mandragora.\r\nBut the electuary composed from the heads of poppies, and, particularly\r\nthat which is drunk with sodden wine, to the amount of a spoonful, or a\r\nspoonful and a half, often disposes to sleep. Those who are not troubled\r\nwith fulness of the head may use the following fumigations in the\r\ndecline: Of Indian leaf, of amomum, of costus, of arnabo, of each ℥ j, of\r\nthe fruit of the balsam tree lb. j, of storax, of ammoniac perfume, of\r\nScythian bdellium, of the root of the mandragora, and juice of poppy, as\r\nmuch; use as a fumigation with cypress-wood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We are informed by Celsus that Asclepiades trusted almost\r\nentirely to gentle friction in such cases. (iii, 18.)\r\n\r\nOur author, as usual, copies freely from Oribasius. (See Synops. vi,\r\n31.) Nearly the same directions are given by Aëtius. (v, 116.) Those in\r\nthe beginning of the Section are from Galen; the remaining part is from\r\nHerodotus and Philumenus.\r\n\r\nNonnus gives a correct account of the established rules of treatment in\r\nsuch cases. Thus, he directs us to use ligatures, and apply friction,\r\nto the extremities; and, if this treatment have not the desired effect,\r\nto have recourse to soporific decoctions, or liniments prepared with\r\npoppies, opium, mandragora, &c., or even to give internally an infusion\r\nof poppy heads. (Epitome, 145.)\r\n\r\nThe directions given by Avicenna are so like our author’s that we must\r\nsuppose them copied from him. He directs us first to try the effect of\r\nfatiguing the patient by talking loud to him, placing many candles in\r\nhis chamber, and applying ligatures to his extremities. When this method\r\ndoes not succeed, he recommends the soporific applications mentioned by\r\nour author. When there is nothing to forbid the use of it, he permits the\r\nsyrup of poppies. (iv, i, 2, 20.) Haly Abbas likewise recommends poppies\r\nexternally and internally. (Pract. iii, 23.) Averrhoes briefly directs\r\nfood and applications of a soporific nature. (Collig. vii, 2.) Rhases\r\nmentions our author’s plan of treatment, and further seems to approve of\r\nliniments made of mandrogora, opium, henbane, and the juice of lettuces.\r\n(Cont. xxxi.)\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus remarks that the indiscreet use of soporifics may bring\r\non lethargy. According to Prosper Alpinus, the Methodists approved of\r\nfomentations, consisting of soporific medicines, such as lettuces, opium,\r\nand the like. (Med. Meth. vi, 8.)\r\n\r\nThe earlier of the modern writers on medicine approve of applying to\r\nthe nose a sponge soaked in a soporific liniment prepared from opium,\r\nhenbane, mandrake, cicuta, lettuce, and the like. (See Theodoricus, iii,\r\n8.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLIII.—THE CURE OF CATAPHORA OR SOMNOLENCY.\r\n\r\nSponge the forehead with oxycrate of the temperature of new milk;\r\nput tight ligatures round the extremities; and apply to the nose\r\nstrong-smelling things of an incisive quality. In the remissions, apply\r\ncupping instruments between the shoulders along the spine. When the\r\ndisease is protracted, errhines must be tried during the remission. Let\r\nthe food consist of things having incisive and dividing properties, as\r\nrecommended by us in our general directions regarding the health.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The treatment mentioned by our author is recommended by\r\nalmost all the other authorities both before and after his time. See, in\r\nparticular, Oribasius (Synops. vi, 33); Aëtius (v, 117); Nonnus (Epitome,\r\n146); Avicenna (iv, 1, 2, 18); Haly Abbas (Pract. iii, 23.)\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus gives an excellent account of the practice of the\r\nMethodists. It consisted of painful friction, tight ligatures,\r\nrubefacients applied to the extremities or head, sternutatories, and, in\r\nshort, everything calculated to rouse. (Med. Meth. vi, 7.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLIV.—THE CURE OF HEADACH IN FEVERS.\r\n\r\nWhen headach proves troublesome in fevers, after the accustomed\r\nevacuations, in the decline of the paroxyms, the head ought to be\r\nanointed, first with the common oil from unripe olives, or with rose\r\noil, to which a very small quantity of vinegar has been added; which,\r\nif it be the summer season, and the fever of the ardent type, may be\r\nused cold; but, in winter, if the fever be not ardent, it must be hot or\r\ntepid. In the oil may be boiled the juice of wild thyme and knot-grass\r\n(_polygonum_); and in summer, the heads of the poppy, or the poppy itself\r\nmay be added, as in winter, a moderate quantity of the hogs-fennel may\r\nbe substituted in place of it. When the pain continues in the forehead,\r\nif the open of the head be bare, a poultice may be applied to it, made\r\nof old barley-meal and knot-grass; or, in like manner, of bread and\r\nroses, or of some myrtle or wild thyme. Some are rather benefited by an\r\nadmixture of pennyroyal, and others, when the affection was of a hot\r\nnature, have rather been remedied, by having flea-wort (_psyllium_) added\r\nto the barley-flour, or even by this substance alone, when boiled to\r\nthe consistence of bird-lime. It must be frequently changed. Coriander\r\nwith barley-meal may be used in like manner. Aloes with vinegar are also\r\nto be rubbed in, or myrrh and ammoniac in like manner, and crocomagma.\r\nPulsatory pains are dispelled by rue and mint, with bread, to which a\r\nlittle rose oil has been added. When the pain does not yield to the\r\nafore-mentioned remedies, we must first cut the hair close by the\r\nskin, and then rub some of the oily embrocations over it all; after\r\nwhich cupping-instruments are to be applied to the hind-head, and the\r\nextremities to be bound with ligatures, and chafed. Leeches also are a\r\nproper application. But if a catarrh or defluxion raise the pain in the\r\nhead, we must apply the remedies which will afterwards be described in\r\nthe proper place. But if exhalations from the stomach have been carried\r\nupwards, and hurt the head, we must attend to them, as is stated below.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Part of the directions delivered by Celsus for the treatment\r\nof headach deserves to be given in his own language: “Si capitis dolores\r\nsunt, rosam cum aceto miscere oportet, et in id ingerere: deinde habere\r\nduo pittacia, quæ frontis latitudinem longitudinemque æquent: ex his\r\ninvicem alterum in aceto et rosâ habere, alterum in fronte: aut intinctam\r\niisdem lanam succidam imponere. Si acetum offendit purâ rosâ uterdum est,\r\nsi rosa ipsa lædit, oleo acerbo.” If this does not succeed, he recommends\r\nother more refrigerant applications prepared with iris, poppies, ceruse,\r\nlitharge, &c. (iii, 10, 112.)\r\n\r\nWhen headach occurs towards the beginning of fever, Galen bleeds once\r\nand again, if there be nothing to contra-indicate depletion, and more\r\nespecially if the patient be plethoric. He then attends whether it arise\r\nfrom fumes proceeding from the stomach, or constipation of the bowels,\r\nand corrects these conditions accordingly. If it make its attack after\r\nthe seventh day, he first evacuates the bowels by clysters, then cups the\r\nback part of the head or neck, or uses paregoric applications, such as\r\nrose oil, with some vinegar, if in summer; but, if in winter, especially\r\nin persons of a cold temperament, the oil of chamomile, with a fifth part\r\nof vinegar. See further ‘De Med. sec. Locos.’ (ii.)\r\n\r\nAlexander recommends attention as to whether the headach be connected\r\nwith the crisis, and in that case he cautions against meddlesome\r\ninterferences, which may do more harm than good. When any applications\r\nare admissible, he recommends that they be of a cooling and soporific\r\nnature. (i, 10.)\r\n\r\nAëtius likewise recommends bleeding, purging, and vomiting, when not\r\ncontra-indicated; and gives very proper directions about the local\r\napplications. He directs us to soak a handful of wool in some cooling\r\nfluid, and, holding it above the head, to squeeze out the fluid, so that\r\nit may fall upon the head from a height. (v, 100.)\r\n\r\nPalladius says that headach in fevers is occasioned by repletion and\r\ndistension of the veins, owing to fumes arising from the stomach. (De\r\nFebribus, 13.) Nonnus merely abridges our author’s account. (Epit. 147.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna’s directions about the local applications are brief, and similar\r\nto those of the Greeks. (iv, i, 2, 19.) Haly Abbas recommends bleeding\r\nand attention to the state of the stomach, for the relief of which he in\r\ncertain cases permits the use of wine. (Pract. iii, 20.) Rhases joins\r\npreceding authorities in recommending vinegar and rose oil to be poured\r\nupon the head. They are to be used cold in summer, but hot if in winter.\r\n(Cont. xxx.)\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Celsus approved of cold and astringent applications\r\nto the head. The Methodists condemned this practice, and recommended\r\nhot water to be poured upon the open of the head. Hippocrates seems to\r\nallude to this practice, when he says: “Much hot water poured upon the\r\nhead removes fever.” (Aphor. vii, 42.) Prosper Alpinus gives an excellent\r\naccount of the Methodical treatment. (Med. Meth. ii, 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLV.—ON THE CURE OF STOMACH AFFECTIONS.\r\n\r\nIf the stomach be weak, we must apply strengthening cataplasms to it,\r\nsuch as those made of dates and wine, and of barley-meal and saffron,\r\nand of mastich and aloes; and use embrocations from wormwood, the oil of\r\napples, and of mastich, nard, and wine; and if hot, we must add cooling\r\nthings, such as the juices of gourd, lettuce, purslain, nightshade,\r\nendive, and unripe grapes. But if the bowels appear to be inflamed, it\r\nwill be proper to add to the embrocations some of the relaxing medicines,\r\nsuch as oil of chamomile and of privet, the grease of a cock or goose\r\nand bdellium, ammoniac, or the like; and to the cataplasms, the seed of\r\nparsley and fenugreek, the flowers of the marshmallows and chamomile;\r\nand, in a word, let the application be a compound of relaxing, attenuant,\r\nbitter, and astringent properties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Celsus notices these affections. When there is pain and\r\ninflammation about the præcordia, he recommends us to use at first\r\nrepellent cataplasms, and, when the inflammation abates, to exchange\r\nthese for hot fomentations, whereby the remains of the complaint will be\r\nremoved. Pain without inflammation requires no application, as it will be\r\ncarried off by the fever itself. (iii, 10.)\r\n\r\nGalen treats of all sorts of applications for affections of the stomach\r\nin his work, ‘De Med. sec. Locos’ (viii.) Our author follows Aëtius. (v,\r\n95.)\r\n\r\nFor atony of the stomach, Alexander recommends the applications mentioned\r\nby our author. When there is ardor of the stomach, a seasonable draught\r\nof cold water, he says, may do much good, whereas, if unseasonably\r\ngiven, it will prove highly dangerous. For atony of the stomach, he\r\nalso recommends hot wine, if not contra-indicated; and most especially\r\nfriction of the extremities. When it can be borne, the bath, he says,\r\nproves beneficial in cases of atony. When there is a sense of cold,\r\nhe recommends poppies and wormwood. When the stomach is loaded with\r\noffensive humours, he directs an emetic of oil and water to be given.\r\nThis remedy, he adds, sometimes operates downwards with the best\r\neffects, and he directs its purgative operation to be promoted by\r\ngiving suppositories. He concludes, with recommending the stomach to be\r\nstrengthened by giving a decoction of wormwood with wine, but forbids\r\nthis medicine until the fever be abated. (xii, 3.)\r\n\r\nOf the Arabian authors, Serapion’s account is the fullest, but it is\r\ntaken almost word for word from Alexander. (vi, 19.) Rhases states that\r\nhe had often seen bad consequences arise from evacuation having been\r\npractised before attending to the stomach. (Contin. xxv.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLVI.—ON INORDINATE CHILLS AND RIGORS IN FEVERS.\r\n\r\nWhen rigors are critical, we must not interfere with them, nor attempt\r\nto put an end to the struggle; and a chill succeeding to a sweat will\r\nreadily pass away and give no trouble. But when the rigor and chills\r\nare protracted, and more particularly, if occasioned by a collection of\r\ncold phlegm, we are first to apply ligatures round the limbs in various\r\nways, and then anoint them with the oil of chamomile, or of privet, or\r\nof iris; or, if a stronger application be required, we may add to the\r\noil some pepper, or the seed of the rosemary, or adarce, or castor, and\r\nthe whole body is to be gently rubbed with these things. And in order\r\nthat the oil may not readily run off, a small quantity of wax may be\r\nmelted with it. Or, if it is the rigor not attended with heat, we must\r\nuse the most powerful restorative ointments (acopa), and also dropaces\r\nand sinapisms. Proper fomentations ought likewise to be got ready. The\r\nacrid-scented things are likewise proper, such as calamint, pennyroyal,\r\nand hyssop. Before the attack, we should likewise give for drink honied\r\nwater, in which pepper and rue have been boiled. And we should likewise\r\ngive of the Cyrenaic juice, to the size of a millet, two hours before the\r\nparoxysm, mixing it up with boiled honey; and we are to give the juice of\r\nthe laserwort in like manner. And the composition for quartans, made from\r\nthe Cyrenaic juice, has proved beneficial to many. And some, by going\r\ninto a bath of hot oil, have shaken off obstinate rigors, as Archigenes\r\naffirms. But Galen recommends, before the attack, rubbing the skin with\r\nsouthernwood, or dried calamint, or the leaves and flowers of flea-bane\r\n(conyza), or with costus, or pellitory, these two last with oil. By these\r\nmeans the rigors will nearly or altogether cease.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. These febrile symptoms are treated of by Celsus at\r\nconsiderable length. (iii, 11, 12.) He properly recommends fomentations\r\nof a hot and dry nature, and friction with calefacient oils. When\r\nproduced by a bilious defluxion upon the stomach, he gives saltish water\r\nso as to operate as an emetic. He makes mention of the bath, and in\r\ncertain cases allows wine. For Galen’s sentiments, see ‘de Diff. Febr.’\r\n(ii), ‘de Causis Sympt.’ (ii, 5), ‘de Inequali Intemp.,’ ‘de Tremore,\r\nPalp. et Rigore.’ The last-mentioned work, in particular, contains some\r\ningenious speculations on the nature of rigors. Our author has mentioned\r\nGalen’s treatment. Hippocrates pronounces a rigor occurring in continued\r\nfever, when the patient is become weak, a mortal symptom. (Aphor.)\r\n\r\nAëtius states that tremors take place in fevers for the most part owing\r\nto errors in eating and drinking. Holding them to be connected with\r\ndisorder of the spinal marrow, he directs us to apply to the back wool\r\nsoaked in some stimulant oil, or to put the patient into a bath of oil.\r\nHe recommends castor, both when taken by the mouth and applied externally\r\nwith the embrocations. (v, 130.)\r\n\r\nAccording to the explanation of Palladius, rigors and tremors are\r\noccasioned by fumes or vapours arising in the internal parts, and being\r\ndiffused over the body. (24.)\r\n\r\nThe treatment recommended by Haly Abbas is simple and judicious. He\r\ndirects us to give draughts of hot water, to put the patient’s feet into\r\nhot water, and to rub the feet, and, if necessary, the other parts of the\r\nbody, with calefacient oils and the like. (Pract. iii, 20.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna gives a very accurate account of the different modes of\r\ntreatment, but they are much the same as our author’s. He approves of\r\nligatures to the extremities, of rubbing them with stimulant oils, or\r\neven with liniments prepared with assafœtida and mustard. He says the\r\nbath of hot oil is very beneficial. He also recommends draughts of hot\r\nwater, and potions containing opium, which, he remarks, will procure\r\nsleep and perspiration. In certain cases he allows hot wine, which had\r\nbeen recommended by Hippocrates. (Aph. vii, 56.) He directs us to open\r\nthe bowels with the hiera, or pills of assafœtida. (iv, i, 2.) Rhases\r\nparticularly commends a draught of hot water. (Cont. xxx.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLVII.—ON SWEATS.\r\n\r\nWe must allow critical sweats to go on until they produce the necessary\r\nevacuation, and assist by means of moderate heat and rest, and by not\r\nwiping away the sweat (for one brings on another), by washing the mouth\r\nwith warm liquids, by warm drinks, and by sleep. The sweats which occur\r\nin the decline of a fever are to be treated like the critical. Sudorific\r\nremedies are sufficiently treated of in the 48th section of the First\r\nBook. But when the sweats exceed in quantity, they must be wiped off,\r\nand the covering of clothes lightened, so as to cool the patient. For,\r\nby exceeding, they occasion lassitude, and often bring on syncope. Let,\r\ntherefore, the covering be light and moistened; let the air be cooled;\r\nand let ventilation be used during sleep. Let the black myrtle, pounded,\r\nbe sprinkled on the body, and gall, and the bark of the pine, in like\r\nmanner. Let amber and polenta, with astringent wine, be applied to the\r\nproper parts; and let the face be sponged with oxycrate. Archigenes\r\nuses quicklime and the burned lees of wine in these cases, and for the\r\nrigor not succeeded by heat; for both, he says, when heated, become\r\ndry. He also orders us to bathe the middle parts of the body with the\r\njuice of plantain, or coriander, or purslain, or cabbage, that they may\r\nobstruct the passages of the sweat. In sleep, pieces of cloth smeared\r\nwith Cimolian earth, dissolved in water, are to be applied to the back\r\nand chest; and the whole body should be anointed with the oil of roses,\r\nor of apples, or of lentisk, or of myrtle, or with the cerates from them.\r\nBut fatty substances are particularly adapted to them; for, by shutting\r\nup the insensible pores, they prevent the passage of the fluid. It is\r\nclear that dry food and moderately astringent wines are befitting to\r\nthem; but much drink should be avoided, and, in particular, all things\r\nof a very liquid nature, and likewise frequent washings of the mouth.\r\nBut, if possible, gestation should be taken in a cold state of the air.\r\nThe extremities in particular are to be cooled by these means. For\r\nthose sweats which are extorted by spasms and pains, tight ligatures,\r\nor fomentations, are to be applied to the extremities, and they may be\r\nrelieved by gently rubbing with woollen cloths.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates has delivered many interesting remarks on sweats\r\nwhich occur in fevers. (See Epidem., Aphor., Prognost. _passim._) Febrile\r\nsweats, attended with miliary eruptions, are held to be unfavorable. “In\r\ngeneral,” he says, “sweats proceed either from resolution of the body,\r\nor the intensity of the inflammation.” (Prog.) In general he holds that\r\nfebrile sweats, unless they occur on critical days are unfavorable.\r\n(Aphor.)\r\n\r\nGalen remarks that profuse sweats are occasioned by rarity (i. e.\r\nrelaxation) of the body, or redundance of the superfluity, or thinness\r\nthereof. The perspiration is checked, on the other hand, either because\r\nthe superfluity is small in quantity, thick, and viscid; or because the\r\npores of the skin are constricted. Either state, he adds, may arise from\r\natony of the natural powers of the flesh. (De Causis Sympt. iii, 9.) He\r\nsays, in another place, that for the removal of copious sweats astringent\r\nand refrigerant remedies are indicated, and that everything of a relaxing\r\nnature ought to be avoided. He recommends cold wine, and forbids all\r\nhot things, also ligatures to the extremities, emetics, and motion. He\r\napproves of cool air medicated by sprinkling the apartment of the sick\r\nwith austere things, such as myrtles, vine shoots, and roses. (Therap. ad\r\nGlauc. ii.)\r\n\r\nCelsus directs us, when the febrile sweats are slight, to rub the body\r\nwith oil, and, when more profuse, with roses, quince ointment, or myrtle\r\noil, to which austere wine is to be added. (iii, 6.)\r\n\r\nConstantinus Africanus and his prototype Synesius concur in directing\r\ncolliquative sweats to be checked by rubbing the body with oil of\r\nmyrtles, of roses, &c. They commend an epitheme made of a decoction of\r\nroses, the flowers of the wild pomegranate, galls, and myrtle leaves,\r\nto which a proper proportion of oil is to be added. They also direct us\r\nto place beside the patient vessels filled with water, to sprinkle the\r\napartment with myrtles, roses, &c. to give him the syrup of roses, in\r\ncold water, and to avoid exercise.\r\n\r\nActuarius takes notice of the miliary eruption which sometimes\r\naccompanies profuse sweats. He reckons it an unfavorable symptom. (Meth.\r\nMed. i, 58.) He also makes mention of other cutaneous eruptions, some\r\nresembling those produced by nettles, or the bites of gnats, and others\r\nof a red or black colour. (Ibid.)\r\n\r\nSerapion recommends styptic and desiccative applications, such as galls,\r\nfrankincense, alum, the flowers of vine, myrtles, and the like. (De\r\nAntidotis, vi, 20.)\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas briefly recommends friction with styptic oils, and to remove\r\nthe patient to a cool apartment. (Pract. iii, 24.)\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius, in like manner, recommends friction with astringent oils,\r\nsuch as those prepared with roses, pomegranates, and the like. (xxxi, 2,\r\n8.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna and Rhases adopt the same plan of treatment as our author.\r\nThe latter directs us to rub the body with rose oil, or myrtle oil, to\r\nsprinkle the patient with rose water in the decoction of myrtles, to\r\nfan him, and to lay in his chamber the tops of cooling herbs and trees.\r\n(Contin. xxxi.)\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus informs us that the Methodists approved of cool air, of\r\nsprinkling the face with cold fluids, of rubbing the body with styptic\r\noils, and of giving astringent wines internally. He also mentions the\r\napplication of snow over the arteries of the extremities, and pouring\r\ncold water over those of the wrist. It is to be regretted, however, that\r\nthis author too frequently omits to quote his ancient authorities. (See\r\nMedic. Method., vi, 18, and vii, 3.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLVIII.—ON COUGH IN FEVERS.\r\n\r\nWe must endeavour to remove a cough in fevers, more especially in such as\r\ncome on with rigors, for it exasperates the fever when it is subsiding.\r\nWe must give lozenges from boiled honey to hold below the tongue, for\r\nthese melt and remove the substances which obstruct respiration. The time\r\nfor using them is at the acme of the paroxysm, and a short time before\r\nthe attack. Well-boiled hydromel must likewise be given. When there is no\r\nsuspicion of the nerves being affected, in process of time you may give\r\noxymel with confidence, or if not it, the decoction of hyssop, which is\r\na remedy also for rigors. If the fever is not of the ardent kind, you\r\nmay give castor, which is also of use to the nervous system. Electuaries\r\nmay be used, made of the kernels of the common and wild pine, iris,\r\nlinseed, bitter almonds, and nettle-seed. But the most of these may be\r\nmixed with the food. Turpentine-rosin should be given in an egg. To the\r\nchest and the parts about the trachea, apply a sulphurated woollen cloth,\r\nand oil of rue, or of iris, or of dill. Tight ligatures long applied are\r\nexcellent for stopping cough, I mean to the middle and extremities. Nor\r\nwill it be unsuitable to use for the cough stavesacre dried, which may\r\nbe chewed with dried grapes or mastich. The extremities may be rubbed,\r\nchafed, and bound with ligatures, and afterwards the retracted parts\r\nunbound. But if the cough annoys, owing to the acrid nature of the\r\nfever, we must use a gargle of tepid water. Cold water also is often\r\nuseful; and, in like manner, gargles of oxycrate, or of the decoctions of\r\ndates, roses, or liquorice. Moderately cooling things are also to be laid\r\nover the bowels and heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen gives some ingenious remarks on the causes of coughing.\r\nHe states that when any substance becomes fixed in the trachea, as it\r\nis a cartilaginous and hard tube, and incapable of contraction, nature\r\nbrings on coughing, by which a violent expiration of air is induced.\r\nA cough, then, is nothing but a violent expiration by which nature\r\nendeavours to expel any body that obstructs the air-passages; and, when\r\nshe cannot accomplish this at the first effort, she repeats it once and\r\nagain until she effect her purpose. He goes on to state, that such fluids\r\nas are very watery, instead of being brought up, are merely divided or\r\ncut asunder by the current of air, while such as are thick and viscid,\r\nadhere so closely to the sides of the windpipe that they cannot be\r\nremoved, and hence violent efforts are necessary to effect the discharge\r\nof them. (De Causis Sympt. ii, 4.) He treats fully of compositions for\r\ncoughs in his work ‘De Comp. Med. sec. Loc.’ (vii.) See the 28th Section\r\nof the Third Book.\r\n\r\nAvicenna recommends cough pills and lohocks made with poppies, the cold\r\nmedulla of fruit, starch, and the like. (iv, i, 2.)\r\n\r\nThe prescriptions of Serapion contain liquorice, sweet almonds,\r\ntragacanth, and the like. (De Antidotis, vii, 17.) Those of Haly Abbas\r\nare very similar. (Pract. iii, 22.)\r\n\r\nA receipt is given by Rhases for cough pills, the principal ingredients\r\nof which are tragacanth, sweet almonds, poppy seed, gum Arabic, and\r\nArmenian bole. (Divis. i, 52.) Many such receipts are given by Myrepsus.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLIX.—ON SNEEZING.\r\n\r\nSneezing frequently occurring in fevers is troublesome, for it determines\r\nto the head and weakens the strength, and, in some cases, it produces a\r\ndischarge of blood. Such are the bad effects of sneezing, which ought\r\ntherefore, to be contended against. It is restrained by rubbing the nose,\r\nforehead, and eyes; by yawning, frequent friction of the roof of the\r\nmouth, eructation, stretching of the loins, raising the head, turning\r\nto the side, gently chafing the extremities, anointing the masseter\r\nmuscles, pouring hot oil into the ears, applying a warm cushion under the\r\nchin. It is proper to avoid being roused suddenly from sleep, and also\r\nsmoke, dust, acrid smells, pepper, castor, mustard, and mint. The smell\r\nof apples and polenta is proper, for it blunts the desire of sneezing.\r\nThe empty sea-sponges do the same. When there is a frequent desire of\r\nsneezing without the ability, let the lips be composed, let the patient\r\nsmell to acrid substances, and let the mind be relaxed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen explains that sneezing is a still more violent effort\r\nof nature than coughing, and that its intention is to remove irritating\r\nmatters from the parts about the nose. (De Caus. Sympt. ii, 4.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna gives ample directions for the treatment of sneezing; but they\r\nare evidently copied from our author. (iv, 1, 2.) The same may be said\r\nof Haly Abbas. (Pract. iii, 22.) Rhases recommends us to give warm gruel\r\ninternally, to pour warm water on the head, and to apply oil of gourd, of\r\nroses, and the like, to the nostrils. (Cont. xxxi.)\r\n\r\nCassius Medicus discusses the question why rubbing the nose and eyes\r\nstops sneezing. He supposes that it is by occasioning a discharge from\r\nthese parts, whereby the exciting cause is removed. (Probl. 45.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. L.—ON LOSS OF APPETITE.\r\n\r\nWhen loss of appetite is occasioned by depraved humours, we must give\r\nthose kinds of food and drink which will either clear away such humours\r\nby vomiting, or downwards by the bowels, or those that by dilution will\r\nrender them better. You have the materials of these things treated of in\r\nthe First Book of this work. Should the loss of appetite be occasioned\r\nby debility, since all debility is owing to an intemperament of the\r\nparts, we must cure the species of intemperament by its contraries.\r\nWherefore we will give a more particular account of loss of appetite\r\nin treating of stomach complaints in the Third Book. But in fevers we\r\nmust straightway endeavour to bring back the appetite with aromatics,\r\nmore particularly by giving polenta moistened with water, or oxycrate,\r\nor diluted wine, or a decoction of some of the fragrant and astringent\r\nfruits; by gentle unction and moderate friction of the whole body, by\r\nchafing, by bathing the face, and swallowing a small quantity of water;\r\nand, by putting the fingers down the throat, the stomach has been roused\r\nto bring up the food, more especially if the fluid discharged be bilious\r\nor acid. After the first days, cataplasms of dates, of apples, of the\r\nwild wine, of wormwood, and of aloes, ought to be applied over the\r\nstomach. Let a variety of simple food be prepared, and from grain, having\r\nsome difference from the common articles, but not very different from\r\nthose used in fevers; and among them those fruits which do not readily\r\nturn acid, nor are very sweet, but are ripe; however, they are not to be\r\neaten to satiety, but only so as to whet the appetite for other food.\r\nWhile they are eating, the most delicious articles ought to be present,\r\nwhich may have the power to provoke and incite the desire. After the\r\nfever is gone, should the want of appetite continue during the recovery,\r\nyellow parsnip boiled with oxymel, and lettuces, and pickled olives,\r\nand capers, and pickles, the bulbi, and every other stomachic should be\r\nthought of; and, in particular, those things should be recollected in\r\nwhich the patient delighted most when in good health. Walking, gestation,\r\nvociferation, calefacient plasters, frictions, and exercises ought to be\r\nhad recourse to. And drinking the propoma from wormwood, or from aloes,\r\nor swallowing the vinegar of squills to the amount of a mystrum, have\r\nproved excellent remedies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen’s explanation of the philosophy of the sense of\r\nappetite is very interesting. He remarks that the appetite is a refined\r\nspecies of touch, the seat of which is the mouth of the stomach, which,\r\ntherefore, is supplied with nerves direct from the brain. He goes on\r\nto remark, that the earth is to plants what the stomach is to animals,\r\nsupplying them with abundance of food as long as it is moistened by\r\nseasonable rains; but, when it becomes parched with drought, the plants\r\nin like manner are dried up for want of nutriment. (This comparison is\r\nborrowed without acknowledgment from Aristotle.) To animals, then, as\r\nnot being fixed to the earth (with a few exceptions), nature bestowed a\r\nstomach which is to them a repository of food, such as the earth is to\r\nplants, and she further gave them a sense of want by which they have the\r\ndesire of being filled with food and drink in due season. This desire\r\nof being filled is called the appetite, which arises from a sense of\r\nwant, when the veins of the stomach absorb, and, as it were, suck from\r\nit, whereby a painful feeling is excited, the proper cure of which is a\r\nsupply of food. The sensation then of sucking constitutes hunger. The\r\nloss of appetite may arise either from the sense of the sucking being\r\nlost, or from the process of sucking (absorption?) not taking place, or\r\nfrom the body not being evacuated. (De Causis Sympt. i, 7.) He treats of\r\nstomach affections very fully in his work ‘De Med. sec. Locos.’ (viii.)\r\n\r\nTreatment similar to our author’s is recommended by Alexander (vii, 7),\r\nand by Oribasius (Synops. vi, 35.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna evidently takes his plan of treatment from our author,\r\nfor he recommends emetics, and afterwards fragrant things, with a\r\nplaster composed of fruits laid over the stomach, and wormwood,\r\naloes, &c., internally. (iv, 1, 2, 26.) Among the causes of loss of\r\nappetite mentioned by him in another place are general disorder of the\r\nconstitution in fevers, severe thirst, repletion with depraved humours,\r\nand insensibility of the mouth of the stomach, so that it does not\r\nperceive the suction of the veins. (iii, 13, 2, 7.)\r\n\r\nHaly’s treatment is nearly the same. He recommends fragrant food and\r\nfragrant wine after the acme of the fever, gentle laxatives, and such\r\nmodes of exercise as he can bear. (Pract. iii, 21.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LI.—ON BULIMOS OR INORDINATE HUNGER.\r\n\r\nIf want of appetite should pass into the opposite state, I mean an\r\nexcessive atrophy, called bulimos, we must resuscitate such persons with\r\nroasted pork, or kids, and other savoury things; and, in a word, with\r\nevery strong-scented thing, if the acute stage of the fever be past. We\r\nmust bind the extremities, and rouse, by pinching the cheeks, and pulling\r\nthe hair and ears. When recovered, we must give bread that has been\r\ndipped in diluted wine, or any other diffusible thing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. According to Galen, bulimos is occasioned by a want\r\nconnected with atony, and coldness of the stomach. (De Caus. Sympt. i,\r\n7.) Alexander, on the other hand, says, that it arises from inordinate\r\nheat and weakness of the stomach. He informs us that the vulgar practice\r\nconsisted in giving fragrant things, binding the extremities, rousing\r\nby pinching, giving bread soaked in wine, and, in short, administering\r\nevery thing calculated to cool and strengthen the body. Others, he says,\r\ngive opium in cold water, in order to extinguish the heat of the stomach.\r\nHowever, he disapproves of all these things, and recommends food of\r\ndifficult digestion. He relates the case of a woman affected with bulimia\r\nwho was cured by having a purgative powder given to her, which occasioned\r\nthe discharge of a worm more than twelve cubits long. (vii, 6.)\r\n\r\nAëtius and Oribasius adopt the theory of Galen, and recommend nearly the\r\nsame treatment as our author. Aëtius also directs us to apply over the\r\nstomach cooling cataplasms made of dates, quinces, or polenta, boiled in\r\ndiluted wine.\r\n\r\nSerapion remarks that bulimos is distinguished from the canine appetite,\r\nby the desire in the former complaint being for proper articles of\r\nfood, whereas, in the latter, it is for depraved or improper food. His\r\ntreatment in most respects is like our author’s. He also recommends a\r\nmixture of old odoriferous wine, camphor, and lignum aloes. (ii, 11.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna and Haly Abbas agree with Galen in stating that bulimos\r\nis connected with a cold intemperament of the stomach, whereby the\r\nsensibility and attractive power of the stomach are diminished. Their\r\ntreatment in principle is quite similar to our author’s. In extreme\r\ncases they agree with Galen in recommending the theriac. One of Rhases’\r\nauthorities recommends cardamom, cubebs, and the like. (Cont. xi.)\r\n\r\nThe classical reader is referred to Callimachus for a grand poetical\r\ndescription of Bulimia. (Hymnus in Cererem.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LII.—ON THE CANINE APPETITE.\r\n\r\nAlthough this symptom seldom occurs during fevers, it sometimes does\r\nafterwards; and, since it is allied to loss of appetite, as being the\r\nopposite extreme, it will not be improper to treat of inordinate\r\nappetite, both of them being in excess. Since, therefore, this affection\r\nis generally occasioned by an acid phlegm, we must use those things which\r\nwill divide and dissipate it. Such, in particular, are all sweet and\r\nsaline things, and those which are called heating detergents. We must,\r\ntherefore, give largely of the heating wines. Such are the yellow in\r\ncolour, and those which are red without being styptic. We must also give\r\nthem the sweeter kind, although they should not be thirsty. When they\r\ncome to dinner, we must give them first all fatty things, and everything\r\nbeside which is prepared with much oil, and has no austere or astringent\r\nproperty. These, although they should not overcome the cause of the\r\ncomplaint, at all events, destroy the insatiable desire of food; but\r\nabstinence from them lessens the collection of phlegm in the stomach. We\r\nmust also give pickles, and after them, plenty of the afore-mentioned\r\nwines to be drank. By persevering with these things for some time, the\r\ncomplaint subsides.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. According to Galen, one of the causes of the canine appetite\r\nis an acid cacochymy, and another is an immoderate evacuation of the\r\nwhole body, occasioned either by strong heat or weakness of the retentive\r\nfaculty. (u. a.) Hippocrates recommends the liberal use of wine, in one\r\nof his Aphorisms (ii, 21); and Galen, in his Commentary on the same,\r\nstates that the wine should be tawny-coloured or red, and devoid of\r\nastringency. In another place, he directs us to purge away the offending\r\nhumour with the hiera of aloes. (De Med. sec. Locos. viii.)\r\n\r\nOur author borrows part from Oribasius. (Synops. vi, 34.)\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius recommends the same plan of treatment as the Greeks, when\r\nthe disease is connected with a cold intemperament; but when with a hot,\r\nhe directs us to have recourse to bleeding, cold fruits, and cooling\r\napplications over the stomach. (Pract. xvi, 11.)\r\n\r\nRhases and Avicenna approve in general of our author’s plan of treatment,\r\nto which, however, they suggest some improvements: when the cause of the\r\ncomplaint is an acid phlegm, they direct us to give fatty things, with\r\nmustard, pepper, garlic, and the like. When connected with black bile,\r\nthey approve of bleeding. When it arises from worms, they, of course,\r\napprove of anthelmintics. Sarac, one of Rhases’ authorities, recommends\r\nemetics and purgatives, with a cupping instrument applied over the\r\nstomach. (Contin. xi.)\r\n\r\nSerapion’s treatment is entirely like our author’s. (ii, 10.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LIII.—ON THIRST.\r\n\r\nA protracted thirst may be supposed to be occasioned by dryness, or heat\r\nof the parts, by which liquids pass from the mouth to the stomach; and\r\nthe natural cure of dryness is sleep, and of heat, watching. Some become\r\nthirsty from wine, or the heating nature of their food, in which case,\r\nthe proper cure is cold drink. But some desire drink of a bad quality,\r\nas they do food corresponding to the prevailing cacochymy. I have known\r\npersons seized with unquenchable thirst, of which they died, who had\r\neaten of the vipers called dipsades, and others who had got drunk upon\r\nold wine; and also persons on board of a ship, who, when their fresh\r\nwater failed them, had drunk of sea-water, have all died. Febrile thirst\r\nmay be mitigated, by pouring upon the head the coldest oil, or rose\r\noil. But the best remedy for thirst is the seed of the black lettuce,\r\nchewed, or the liquorice; or, seed of the cucumber may be retained in the\r\nmouth. Give also the following pill, called adipson: Of garden cucumber,\r\ndr. viij; of tragacanth, dr. iv; dissolve the tragacanth in the white\r\nof fresh eggs, and when dissolved, add to the pounded seeds of the\r\ncucumber; and when softened, form pills, which dry in the shade. Give\r\none of these pills to hold below the tongue, and drink the fluid of it\r\nas it dissolves. Give also, to swallow, the decoction of quinces, or of\r\npears, or of medlars, or of the tendrils of the vine, or the juice of the\r\npomegranate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The greater part of this Section is taken from Galen\r\n(de Caus. Symp. l. c.), who, as usual, handles the subject very\r\nphilosophically. Oribasius treats of it in nearly the same terms as our\r\nauthor. (Synops. vi, 37, 38, 39.) Aëtius remarks that there are two\r\ncauses of thirst, a want of humidity, or a redundance of heat. In fevers,\r\nthen, both these causes cooperate to occasion thirst; for there is excess\r\nof heat originally, and dryness comes on owing to the fluids of the body\r\nbeing consumed by the febrile heat. (v, 119.)\r\n\r\nThe question was keenly agitated in the ancient schools of medicine,\r\nwhether cold drink might be safely given in fevers. Hippocrates was a\r\ngreat advocate for this practice, giving his patients barley-water and\r\nacidulated draughts very freely at all periods. Asclepiades, on the\r\nother hand, as Celsus and Alexander inform us, forbade even to wash the\r\npatient’s mouth with water during the first stage of a fever. Celsus\r\nis disposed to hold a middle course between these opposite methods of\r\npractice. He particularly approves of washing the mouth and fauces\r\nfrequently with cold water, because, as Erasistratus had properly\r\nremarked, these parts often required cold liquids, while the internal\r\nparts are not in want of them. Philumenus (ap. Aëtium) also strongly\r\nrecommends gargles, but forbids cold drink freely until after the acme\r\nof the fever. Alexander informs us that the celebrated Archigenes\r\nallowed his patients the free use of cold water and acidulated drinks.\r\nHe himself does not speak very decidedly for or against this practice,\r\nbut, upon the whole, is disposed to think well of it, unless there be\r\ninflammation, hardness, or swelling anywhere. He approves, however, of\r\ncold applications externally: and, accordingly, directs us to apply to\r\nthe region of the stomach a bladder filled with cold water, ice, or some\r\ncooling decoction.\r\n\r\nOf the Arabians, Serapion expresses himself most decidedly in favour of\r\ncold drink. Avicenna forbids much to be given at a time. See also Haly\r\nAbbas (Pract. iii, 22); Alsaharavius (Pract. xvi, 14); Averrhoes (Collig.\r\nvii, 24); and Rhases (Contin. xxx.)\r\n\r\nThe pill mentioned in the end of the Section is from Dioscorides.\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus represents the Methodists to have disapproved of the free\r\nuse of cold water in fever. (Med. Meth. vi, 7.)\r\n\r\nThe highest of the ancient authorities, as for example, Galen, Avicenna,\r\nand Averrhoes, agreed in allowing wine, much diluted with water, in\r\nfevers. Galen says, the wine should be attenuant and of a light colour.\r\nAccording to Avicenna, wine thus plenteously diluted with water is\r\npreferable to plain water, as it promotes perspiration.\r\n\r\nFabius Paulinus gives an admirable exposition of the philosophical\r\ndoctrines of the ancients on this subject. He remarks that there are\r\nthree distinct species of thirst. The first is occasioned by the fauces\r\nand œsophagus being drier or hotter than natural. This state, if it\r\nsupervene upon sleep, is to be cured by watchfulness, or _vice versa_. In\r\nthe second, the veins over the whole body are filled with hot and acrid\r\nhumours. In the third, the mouth of the stomach, lungs, or heart are\r\npreternaturally hot or dry. (Marc. Prælect. 315.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LIV.—ON THE ROUGHNESS OF THE TONGUE.\r\n\r\nWe may moisten asperity of the tongue, by making the patients retain in\r\nthe mouth a decoction of linseed. But it will be more efficacious if\r\nsebesten plums be boiled with the linseed. Having immersed the finger\r\nin this liquor, and rubbed the tongue with it, let them rinse the mouth\r\nwith clear water, or let them clean it with a sponge, and then anoint\r\nit with rose oil. And the oil of roses mixed with honey also answers\r\nwell. Likewise the juice of the purslain retained in the mouth, and the\r\nsumach used for condiments, when mixed with honied water, have a good\r\neffect. Damascenes, also, and the bones of the sebesten plum retained\r\nin the mouth, and rolled on the tongue, and the stem of the lettuce,\r\nanswer well. Archigenes says, that the Indian salt, which, in colour and\r\nconsistence is like the common salt, but which resembles honey in taste,\r\nwhen chewed to the size of a lentil, or, at most, of a bean, moistens\r\ngreatly. They should lie upon the side (for lying upon the back dries\r\ngreatly), and they ought to keep the mouth shut, because keeping it open\r\nallows the moisture to dry up. Sneezing properly produced, moistens the\r\ntongue more effectually than any other means.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. vi, 43.)\r\n\r\nAëtius recommends nearly the same treatment. He also states, that when\r\nthe roughness of the tongue is difficult to remove, it may sometimes be\r\naccomplished by rubbing it with the fat of fowls or with fresh butter.\r\n(v, 118.)\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus directs the tongue to be cleaned with a sponge\r\nsqueezed out of hot water. Avicenna recommends for this purpose an\r\ninstrument called _chaizaran_, and also directs us to use sugar, or a\r\nsponge with a small quantity of salt and rose oil. He likewise makes\r\nmention of the salt brought from India, possessing the colour of salt and\r\nthe taste of honey. (iv, 1, 2, 22.) The Pseudo-Dioscorides recommends\r\nmint triturated with honey, red sumach, and rose oil with honey, or by\r\nitself. (Euporist. ii, 18.)\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus held that the Indian salt, mentioned by our author and\r\nAvicenna, was the same as our sugar. But this opinion was controverted by\r\nCarolus Arantius, (Baptista Fieræ Cœna.) Sprengel, accordingly, maintains\r\nthat the Greeks and Romans were utterly unacquainted with our sugar.\r\n(Rei Herb. Hist., and Notæ in Dioscoridem, ii, 104.) The mel arundinum\r\nappears, in fact, to have been a natural concretion, and it was most\r\nprobably the same as the Indian salt. See Dr. Milward’s Letter to Sir\r\nHans Sloane. The cane from which the ancient sugar was procured is now\r\ncalled by botanists the _bambusa arundinacea_, or bamboo cane. See Book\r\nFirst, 96.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LV.—ON NAUSEA.\r\n\r\nWhen nausea comes on without being produced artificially, it is a clear\r\ninference that noxious humours are vexing the stomach. Some feel uneasy,\r\nbut vomit nothing, the humour being retained in the coats. When the\r\nhumours are pituitous, we must get them concocted by rest, spare diet,\r\nand sleep. But the thinner may be ejected by vomiting, produced either\r\nwith the juice of ptisan, or with honied water. But those which are\r\nviscid and thick, stand in need of attenuant remedies, such as oxymel,\r\nand the like. But, when a noxious fluid is detained in the coats, the\r\npowder from aloes, called picra, is beneficial, but astringents are\r\npernicious; whereas, if there be much fluid, but not of a noxious kind,\r\nastringents will be beneficial, but the aloetic medicine will bring on\r\nmarasmus. When cold is joined to humidity, we must mix calefacients with\r\nastringents. The symptom of the affection being of a cold nature is that\r\nthere is no thirst, nor sensation of heat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Oribasius recommends the same treatment. (Synops. vi, 40.)\r\nOur author appears to have condensed the lengthy account given by Galen\r\nand Aëtius. (ix, v.)\r\n\r\nAlexander also treats of the subject at great length, but we can only\r\nafford room for a few extracts. When the nausea arises from plethora,\r\nhe directs bleeding; and when the plethora is connected with vitiated\r\nhumours, he recommends both bleeding and purging. When bilious or\r\nmelancholic humours occasion the nausea, he recommends dilution at\r\nfirst by giving tepid water or the like, and then evacuations of them\r\nby purging or emetics. When the humour is an acrid or sweet phlegm, he\r\nrecommends oxymel, radishes, and the like. When a serous and thin humour\r\nis impacted in the stomach, he evacuates it by procuring vomiting with\r\ntepid water or ptisan. (vii, 13.)\r\n\r\nSerapion appears to have copied from our author. (iii, 5.) See Avicenna\r\n(iii, xiii, 5, 8.) Rhases applies over the stomach a cold plaster with\r\nsnow. When the nausea is oppressive, he promotes vomiting with tepid\r\nwater. (Cont. xi.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LVI.—ON VOMITING OF BILE.\r\n\r\nTo those who vomit bile, a cataplasm must be applied, made of dates,\r\nthe rind of pomegranate, and gall, boiled in wine or oxycrate, along\r\nwith pounded bread. And acacia, hypocystis, and the flowers of the\r\nwild pomegranate and sumach, ought to be added to the cataplasm. A\r\ncupping-instrument also, when applied with a strong heat, is of great\r\nservice. Food ought to be given frequently in small quantities. To those\r\nwho vomit black bile and have the stomach inflated, apply sponges soaked\r\nin hot vinegar of the most acrid qualities, or a cataplasm of the leaves\r\nof the ivy boiled in wine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is taken from Oribasius (Synops. vi, 41.)\r\n\r\nAlexander states that the proper remedies for vomiting occasioned by\r\na redundance of bile are diluents and refrigerants. He recommends\r\ninternally ptisan, lettuces with a small quantity of vinegar, &c. For\r\ndrink, he particularly approves of cold water, but forbids much to be\r\ngiven at a time. When the strength fails, he permits a small proportion\r\nof hydromel, wine, or the like, to be added to the water. In certain\r\ncases, when the patient is troubled with insomnolency, he directs us\r\nto add the heads of poppies to his drink. He also recommends external\r\napplications possessed of tonic, cooling, and repellent properties. (vii,\r\n17.)\r\n\r\nSerapion recommends us not to interfere with a critical vomiting. When\r\nit is continued, he directs us to give clysters and gentle purgatives\r\nat first, and afterwards vegetable acids and astringents. When these\r\nremedies fail, he directs us, if the strength be good, to bleed from\r\nthe arm. He also makes mention of external applications, possessed\r\nof astringent and refrigerant properties. (iii, 15.) Haly Abbas, in\r\nlike manner, cautions against stopping a critical vomiting. (iii, 24.)\r\nAlsaharavius prescribes draughts of tepid water at first, and afterwards\r\nthe infusion of wormwood or of aloes. He also recommends external\r\napplications of a strengthening nature. (Pract. xvi, 20.) Avicenna’s plan\r\nof treatment appears to have been copied from our author’s. (iv, i, 2.)\r\nRhases recommends acid drinks, such as the decoction of pomegranates and\r\nthe like. (Cont. xi.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Prosper Alpinus, the treatment of the Methodists consisted\r\nin administering sub-acid fruits, the juice of wormwood or of mint in\r\nwine, and in applying externally tonic epithemes, containing sumach,\r\ngalls, mastich, and the like. (Med. Meth. xii, 11.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LVII.—ON HICCOUGH.\r\n\r\nSingultus is occasioned either by fulness, or emptiness; or by the\r\npresence of acrid and pungent humours in the stomach, and when they are\r\nvomited, it ceases. And many, if they only take the medicine composed\r\nof the three kinds of pepper, and drink wine immediately after, have\r\nhiccough. And it is well known that many people hiccup when the food\r\nspoils on the stomach. Many also hiccup from rigors. We will find an\r\nemetic a proper remedy in cases which are occasioned by fulness or\r\npungency, and warmth in those from cold; and, when the complaint is\r\noccasioned by a plethora of humours, there is need of strong evacuation.\r\nThis may be accomplished by sneezing, but when emptiness is the cause,\r\nsneezing will not cure it; for in such cases, we must give rue with\r\nwine, or nitre in honied water, or hartwort, or carrot, or cumin, or\r\nginger, or calamint, or Celtic nard. These are the remedies for such\r\ncases as are occasioned by corruption of the food, cold, or plethora.\r\nWhen a redundance of cold and viscid humours is the cause, give castor to\r\nthe amount of three oboli to drink in oxycrate, and the same thing will\r\nbe of use when applied externally to the skin, along with old Sicyonian\r\noil. The vinegar of squills or oxymel may also be drunk with advantage.\r\nRetaining the breath is likewise of great use.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is copied from Oribasius (Synops. vi, 42.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Galen’s explanation, hiccough is occasioned by any exciting\r\ncause which rouses the stomach to violent emotions. He states that\r\nsneezing proves a cure to it. (De Caus. Sym. iii, 6.) Celsus says, in\r\nlike manner, ‘Singultus sternutamento finitur.’ He states that frequent\r\nand unusual hiccuping is symptomatic of an inflamed liver. (ii, 7.)\r\nAëtius, in like manner, says that singultus in fevers often arises from\r\ninflammation of the stomach and neighbouring parts. He treats of the\r\ncomplaint at great length. When it arises from pungent humours, he gives\r\nfirst emetics, and afterwards narcotics, such as opium, &c. He also\r\napplies a cupping instrument with great heat to the breast, stomach, and\r\nback, in certain cases. (ix, 5.)\r\n\r\nAlexander gives an interesting account of this affection, for which he\r\nrecommends various remedies. When connected with inflammation of the\r\nstomach or liver, he begins with bleeding. When it is occasioned by thick\r\nand viscid humours, he recommends an oxymel of squills, the composition\r\nof which he minutely describes. He also speaks favorably of emetics.\r\nWhen the humours are of a pungent nature he approves of diluents and the\r\ndrinking of tepid water. Sometimes, he adds, he has known a draught of\r\ncold water prove effectual. (vii, 15.)\r\n\r\nWhen singultus is connected with a cold cause, the author of the\r\n‘Euporista,’ ascribed to Dioscorides, recommends us to put the feet into\r\nhot water, to take tepid draughts, and apply hot fomentations to the\r\nstomach. (ii, 4.)\r\n\r\nThough there is perhaps nothing original in the views of the Arabians,\r\nthey treat of hiccough very fully and accurately. Among the causes of it,\r\nmentioned by Alsaharavius, is inflammation of the stomach and liver,\r\nin which case he recommends venesection. When connected with excessive\r\nheat of these parts, he approves of cold air, cold drink, and refrigerant\r\ndraughts, containing prunes, tamarinds, camphor, &c. (xvi, 18.) The\r\ncauses of hiccough, according to Serapion, are evacuation, repletion,\r\npungent and cold humours. His remedies are emetics, calefacients, and\r\nattenuants, which are to be directed according to the nature of the\r\nexciting cause. (iii, 17.) See also Avicenna (iii, 13, v, 25); Rhases\r\n(Divis. 62, ad Mansor. ix, 65, Cont. xi.) Rhases recommends calefacients,\r\nsuch as cumin, pepper, rue, and the like, in vinegar. He also approves of\r\nemetics and laxatives.\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus says that the ancient Methodists approved of oily\r\nemetics. (Meth. Med. vi, 8.) It will be remarked, that our author states\r\nthat many persons are seized with hiccough if they take peppers with\r\nwine. Prosper Alpinus mentions that they had this effect on him (de Præs.\r\nV. et M. ægr. iii, 9); and I have further to state the same of myself.\r\n\r\nRogerius, probably copying from Rhases (for the practice of the earlier\r\nmodern physicians is mostly borrowed from the Arabians), recommends\r\nprincipally calefacient, attenuant, and carminative medicines, mixed with\r\ngentle laxatives, such as prunes. (iii, 21.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LVIII.—ON CONSTIPATION AND LOOSENESS OF THE BOWELS IN FEVERS.\r\n\r\nThose things which remedy a dry state of the bowels are treated of in the\r\nFirst Book sufficiently. But since a humid or loose state of the bowels\r\nmay prevail in fevers, this also must be treated of; for many are cut off\r\nnot by the fever itself, but by this symptom alone. In the commencement,\r\nwe must not interfere with the discharge when it proceeds from corruption\r\nof the food and indigestion; but when the evacuation becomes immoderate,\r\nit must be restrained. If the discharges are of an acrid nature, that\r\nwhich is given should consist of good juices, and be otherwise thick,\r\nsuch as spoon-meats from pearl-spelt (chondrus) and ptisan. Baths are\r\nalso befitting after the complaint has become concocted. But when the\r\ndischarges consist of phlegm and are watery, on the other hand, the\r\nfood ought to be of a more dry and heating nature, as far as the fever\r\nwill permit. Of this kind, are those things which are prepared from\r\nheating condiments. But they must abstain from baths, unless otherwise\r\nrequired. When the digestive faculty is in an atonic state, we must give\r\nfood and applications of an astringent nature; the food consisting of\r\nthings in particular, to which pomegranates, apples, pears, or medlars\r\nhave been added, or these fruits themselves, and thin fragrant wine of\r\nan astringent quality; and the applications are to be cataplasms made\r\nof polenta, and dates, and wormwood, roses, myrtles, and such like\r\nthings. It must be considered also, to what part these cataplasms are\r\nto be applied, I mean the region of the stomach, the lower belly, or\r\nperhaps the loins. Bloody discharges are restrained and dried up by\r\nremedies containing fine flour of polenta, with frankincense, or manna\r\nmixed with wine, or oxycrate. When the watery discharge is acrid, it\r\nmust be sweetened by a _lavement_ either with water alone, or the juice\r\nof ptisan, or of chondrus, or rice, or tragum, not once, but often; and\r\nafterwards there are to be added dried roses, or myrtles, and sometimes\r\ngalls; and an egg with rose oil, and a thin astringent wine, or the\r\ndecoction of roses, may be injected or applied to the anus, which will\r\nblunt the desire of going to stool. But when the calls are frequent, a\r\nclew formed of warm threads may be applied to the anus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen forbids venesection when the fever is complicated with\r\ndiarrhœa. (Therap. ad Glauc. i.)\r\n\r\nWhen the body is constipated, Celsus recommends laxatives, diuretics,\r\nand sudorifics. He adds, it may also be proper to let blood, practise\r\ngestation, enjoin abstinence from food and drink, and keep the patient\r\nfrom sleeping. He likewise recommends the bath, both of tepid water\r\nand of oil. When the bowels are loose he enjoins rest and sleep, gives\r\nmedicines to restrain sweating, and forbids all exercise except gentle\r\ngestation. He also directs us to excite vomiting by copious draughts of\r\ntepid water, unless the complaint be of long standing, or there be pain\r\nof the throat, præcordia, or side. (iii, 6.)\r\n\r\nAlexander forbids narcotics, unless in cases of extreme urgency. Avicenna\r\njoins him in laying down this injunction, and otherwise directs us to\r\ntreat the diarrhœa febrilis upon general principles. (iii, 16, 1, 4.)\r\nHaly Abbas treats fever, when complicated with constipation, by giving\r\ngentle laxatives, such as prunes and tamarinds, or, if these prove\r\ninjurious to the stomach, by administering clysters. When the diarrhœa is\r\ncomplicated with a discharge of blood, he approves of adding to the other\r\nmedicines Armenian earth, purslain, sumach, or such like astringents.\r\n(Pract. iii, 24.) See Serapion (iii, 17); Rhases (Divis. 67.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Prosper Alpinus, the ancient Methodists approved of\r\nastringent applications and astringent clysters for febrile diarrhœa.\r\n(Med. Meth. vi, 10.) Sydenham and Van Swieten agree with Alexander and\r\nAvicenna in forbidding to stop diarrhœa in fevers by means of opiates,\r\nunless in extreme cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LIX.—ON TRICKLING OF BLOOD AND HEMORRHAGE FROM THE NOSE.\r\n\r\nSince a trickling of blood indicates a fulness in the whole body, or in\r\nthe head, being occasioned either by expression or contraction, and as a\r\nfree evacuation would relax them, and diminish the quantity, it may be\r\nproper to evacuate where nature points. With this view, I have ventured,\r\nin cases of quartan epistaxis, to open the vessels in the nostrils with\r\nthe reed called typha. We must not be contented with a small evacuation,\r\nbut must take away blood in proportion to the strength. Spontaneous\r\nhemorrhages from the nose in fevers, when critical, are not to be\r\ninterfered with; but yet, if the flow of blood be immoderate, it ought to\r\nbe restrained. In the first place, tight ligatures ought to be applied to\r\nthe patient’s extremities, and his head elevated. It would appear that\r\na ligature to the privy parts, is particularly adapted for restraining\r\nbleeding from the nose. The nostrils ought not to be wiped, nor the part\r\nirritated, so that a clot of blood may be allowed to form. Let the nose\r\nbe cooled by a sponge soaked in oxycrate, and the nostril plugged up with\r\na pledget dipped in some of the astringent applications. The composition\r\nof them, and the rest of the treatment, we will deliver more fully in the\r\nfollowing Book, “on topical affections.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates declares that profuse bleeding at the nose\r\nindicates a disposition to convulsions, which venesection is calculated\r\nto remove. (Prædict. i, 21.) Galen, in his Commentary, remarks that the\r\nconvulsions are brought on by the unseasonable use of cold applications\r\nto stop the hemorrhage. He strongly recommends bleeding from the arm of\r\nthe side from which the blood flows. In another place, he states that\r\nepistaxis in acute fevers is an unfavorable symptom. (In iii, Epidem.\r\nComment.)\r\n\r\nAëtius mentions that Hippocrates had declared a bleeding from the nose\r\non the fourth day of a fever to be a very bad symptom. He recommends\r\nencouraging the bleeding by irritating the nostrils with a stalk of\r\ngrass. Our author, it will be observed, directs this operation to be\r\nperformed until the _typha_, a species of grain several times mentioned\r\nby Theophrastus (Hist. Plant.); by Galen (de Aliment. i, 13); and by\r\nAlexander Trallian (vii, 5.) Sprengel makes it to be a species of secale\r\nor rye; but Stackhouse, the English editor of Theophrastus, is of opinion\r\nthat it was the _triticum spelta_, or spelt.\r\n\r\nWhen it is judged proper to restrain the hemorrhage, Avicenna recommends\r\nligatures to the extremities and cold and styptic applications to the\r\nnose and adjoining parts, (iv, i, 2, 14, and iii, v, 1.) Serapion\r\nagrees with most of the ancient authorities in commending a mixture of\r\nfrankincense and aloes, when applied on the down of a hare. He also\r\ndirects us to apply a sponge soaked in cold water to the temples and\r\nforehead. (ii, 13.) When bleeding at the nose occurs in a fever, Rhases\r\nforbids us to stop it, unless it prove excessive; in which case, he\r\ndirects us to apply a cupping instrument, without scarification, to the\r\nhypochondrium; to tie ligatures about the testicles; to pour cold water\r\non the head; and to drink cold water. (Divis. 40.)\r\n\r\nConsidering how full and accurate our author and the others are in\r\ntreating of the complications of fever, it is singular that they should\r\nall have passed by a profuse discharge of blood per anum, although it had\r\nbeen noticed by Hippocrates. In one of his Aphorisms he says: “When, in\r\ncases of fever, there is a quantity of blood discharged, the bowels get\r\ninto a loose state.” His commentators Theophilus and Damascius say, in\r\nexplanation, that the natural heat of the intestines being wasted by the\r\ndischarge of blood, they lose their power of retention. (Ed. Dietz, ii,\r\n401.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LX.—ON DELIQUIUM ANIMI OR SWOONING.\r\n\r\nWhen the fainting is occasioned by cholera, diarrhœa, or other repeated\r\nand copious evacuations, we must sprinkle water upon the patient,\r\ntwist his nose, rub over the orifice of the stomach, and encourage\r\nvomiting; and we should also irritate the throat with our fingers or\r\nthe introduction of a feather. Several strong ligatures are likewise\r\nto be applied; when the evacuations are downwards, to the arms; and,\r\nwhen upwards, to the legs. The patients are also to be placed in an\r\neasy, erect posture, and a cupping-instrument applied, so as to produce\r\nrevulsion to the opposite part of the body. Wine and water relieves\r\nprostration of strength occasioned by frequent evacuations, provided\r\nthere be no inflammation of any visceral part, nor violent headach,\r\nnor delirium, nor ardent fever unconcocted, to contra-indicate it; for\r\nin such cases wine will do much mischief. And if it be summer, and the\r\npatient of a hot temperament, and addicted to drink cold things, we\r\nmay give cold drink; but if the contrary, warm. When the deliquium is\r\noccasioned by profuse sweats, we are to constrict the skin, as formerly\r\nsaid, and allow a free current of cool air. In defluxions on the stomach,\r\nnone of these things is fitting, unless the application of strengthening\r\nthings to the belly and stomach, and bathing them; for baths are most\r\nbeneficial in cases of stomach defluxions, but greatly aggravate\r\nhemorrhages and sweatings. Those who have fainting fits from plethora,\r\nmust abstain from wine, and food, and from baths too, if there be fever.\r\nAnd we must give them honied water having thyme, marjoram, pennyroyal,\r\nor hyssop boiled in it. Oxymel also is beneficial to them. But if the\r\nfaintings proceed from depraved humours contained in the stomach, we must\r\nprescribe a vomit with water and oil—at the same time tickling the throat\r\nwith the finger or a feather. But if vomiting cannot be thereby procured,\r\nwe must give pure oil, which will often evacuate downwards. And wormwood\r\nis applicable in such cases. But if the faintings are occasioned by\r\nweakness of the stomach, we must use tonic medicines, as formerly stated\r\nin the Section which treats of this affection, and rub the extremities.\r\nWhen they proceed from exposure to immoderate heat, we are to prescribe\r\nthe bath; or, when from excessive cold, we must use the medicine\r\ncontaining the three peppers, and pepper itself. Those who fall into\r\nfainting fits owing to great heat, or insolation, or from remaining long\r\nin the bath, may be cured by being sprinkled with cold water, and exposed\r\nto the wind; by having their stomach rubbed, and getting wine and food.\r\nBut if the swooning be occasioned by the greatness of the inflammation,\r\nor bad nature of the fever in the attacks, and if the patient is cold, we\r\nought to rub his limbs strongly, chafe him, apply ligatures, force him\r\nto keep awake, and abstain from food. And these things are to be done\r\nprevious to the paroxysm. But those who have faintings from dryness,\r\nshould get for food two or three hours before the paroxysm either the\r\njuice of chondrus, or bread out of water, along with the kernels of the\r\npomegranate, or apples, or pears. But if great danger be anticipated, we\r\nmust also give wine. Those who have sudden attacks of fainting are to\r\nbe thus treated. And in all cases we are to find out the cause of the\r\ndeliquium, and direct our attention to it. And sometimes the greatest\r\ncare must be bestowed upon this symptom, which threatens danger, or death\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Nearly the same account of deliquium animi in fevers is given\r\nby Aëtius (v, 101 et seq.), and by Oribasius (de Morb. Curat. iii, 7.)\r\nBut all these authors are, in fact, indebted to Galen. (Therap. ad Glauc.\r\ni.) Aëtius thus states the distinction between syncope and deliquium:\r\n“Deliquium makes its attack suddenly, depriving the person of sense and\r\nmotion, but is not necessarily accompanied with sweats; but syncope\r\nseizes upon persons both when asleep and when awake, and is necessarily\r\nattended with sweats, called syncoptic.”\r\n\r\nAlexander delivers a full account of the subject; but his principles of\r\ntreatment scarcely differ in any respect from those of Galen. (xii, 13.)\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas directs us, when the deliquium proceeds from a defluxion of\r\nhumours upon the stomach, to apply ligatures to the extremities, to\r\ndash water on the face, to fan it, and to give vinegar and pepper. He\r\nrecommends us to prevent sleep, which has a tendency to extinguish the\r\npowers of the primary viscera, by occasioning a determination inwardly.\r\nWhen it proceeds from dryness, he directs us to give wine, the decoction\r\nof quinces, of apples, and the like. If it happen at the commencement,\r\nhe recommends a piece of bread soaked in wine to be given. (Pract. iii,\r\n25.)\r\n\r\nThe Arabians in general do not acknowledge the distinction between\r\nsyncope and deliquium. See Averrhoes (Colliget. vii, 16); Serapion (vi,\r\n19); Rhases (ad Mansor. x, 13.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna seems to point at the distinction, but it is not perceived by\r\nhis translator. Rhases recommends the same treatment as Haly Abbas. He\r\napproves of hot wine, food of easy digestion, sprinkling of the face with\r\ncold water, and the application of ligatures to the extremities. (Contin.\r\nxxxi.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXI.—ON THE TREATMENT OF ULCERATION UPON THE OS SACRUM.\r\n\r\nThis affection occurs most frequently in protracted fevers, owing to the\r\npatients having been long confined to bed. When, therefore, the part\r\nbegins to appear red, we make a circular piece of wool, of the proper\r\nmagnitude, and lay it below the part, and afterwards prepare a rose or\r\nmyrtle cerate, containing litharge or ceruse, and apply it. When there\r\nis inflammation, we may use a cataplasm of bread, with nightshade, or\r\nknot-grass, or plantain, or tender cabbage. But if the ulceration be\r\nspreading, we are to use a cataplasm of dried lentils, along with the\r\ninner rind of the pomegranate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Oribasius (Synops. vi, 44.)\r\n\r\nAëtius remarks that, in prolonged fevers, the fleshy parts of the body\r\nbeing wasted, ulceration takes place in those parts upon which the\r\npatient lies. These sores, he adds, spread deep, and have hard thick\r\nedges. When the back becomes red and painful, he directs us to surround\r\nthe adjoining parts with a circle of wool, so as to relieve the affected\r\npart from the effects of pressure; and then a cerate of rose or myrtle\r\noil, containing litharge, ceruse, and burnt barley is to be applied. He\r\nparticularly commends a composition consisting of litharge, oil, wax, and\r\nhoney, mixed with rose-oil. In short, his plan of treatment, like our\r\nauthor’s, is borrowed from Oribasius. He concludes with directing the\r\nuse of milder applications when the ulceration has stopped spreading. (v,\r\n127.)\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius directs us to treat the redness of the back occasioned by\r\nlying long in bed with the flower of millet, barley, or lentils. When\r\npustules form and break, he recommends an ointment containing ceruse to\r\nbe applied. (Pract. xxix, 1, 26.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Appendix to the Commentary on Book Second._\r\n\r\nON SMALLPOX AND MEASLES.\r\n\r\nThe reader, we are sure, would be disappointed, if we were to quit the\r\nsubject of Fever without touching upon the history of Smallpox and\r\nMeasles. We will, therefore, conformably with our general plan, give a\r\nbrief abstract of the descriptions of these diseases which we meet with\r\nin the works of the ancient physicians. In the first place, then, we may\r\nmention that, after having read, we may say, every word of every ancient\r\nwriter on medicine that has come down to us, we can confidently affirm\r\nthat the Greeks and Romans are altogether silent on the subject, and that\r\nwe are indebted to the Arabians for the earliest accounts which we have\r\nof these diseases. Rhases, indeed, pretends (provided the Introduction to\r\nhis ‘Treatise on Smallpox’ be not spurious) that Galen had delivered some\r\nimperfect descriptions of smallpox; but he would appear to have been led\r\ninto this mistake by following some inaccurate translation of the works\r\nof Galen into the Syriac language; for no passages which would justify\r\nthe interpretation which Rhases puts upon them are now to be found in the\r\noriginal. Lately, Dr. Bateman attempted to show that allusions to measles\r\nand smallpox are to be met with in the works of several of the Greek\r\nauthors; but we entirely agree with Drs. Mead and Freind, who maintain\r\nthe contrary. In an Arabian MS. preserved in the University of Leyden, it\r\nis stated that the smallpox and measles first appeared in Arabia about\r\nthe year 572, P.C. See Reiske (Opuscula Medica, p. 10.)\r\n\r\nAlthough Rhases be the most ancient writer whose account of smallpox\r\nand measles has come down to us, he does not pretend to have been the\r\nfirst of his countrymen who had noticed them, but gives extracts from the\r\nworks of the elder Mesue, the elder Serapion and Aaron, wherein mention\r\nis made of them. According to Rhases, the common cause of smallpox is a\r\nfermentation in the blood; and hence the disease is most apt to seize\r\nchildren, whose blood is hotter than that of other persons. He was well\r\naware, however, that the disease is capable of being propagated by\r\ncontagion, for he ranks the pestilential fever or smallpox among the\r\ndiseases “qui transeunt ab uno ad alios.” The symptoms, as described\r\nby him, are, continued fever, pain in the back, itching at the nose,\r\ndisturbed sleep, and afterwards redness and fulness of the face, pain of\r\nthe throat, difficulty of breathing, dryness of the mouth, thick spittle,\r\nhoarseness, headach, inquietude; and these symptoms are followed by the\r\ncharacteristic eruption of the smallpox or measles; but in the case of\r\nthe latter there is more anxiety of mind, sick qualms, and heaviness of\r\nheart; and in that of the former there is more pain in the back, heat,\r\nand inflammation of the whole body, especially in the throat, with a\r\nshining redness. He then lays down the rules of treatment. He directs us\r\nto bleed from the arm at the commencement, provided the patient be more\r\nthan fourteen years old, but by a cupping instrument if he be younger.\r\nHe forbids us, however, to abstract blood after the eruption is come\r\nout. He allows light kinds of animal food, with acids; and for drink he\r\nrecommends water cooled with snow, or cold spring water, or some diluent\r\nand acid draught, such as barley-water acidulated with pomegranate juice.\r\nAaron, one of his authorities, forbids, however, the administration of\r\ncold water when the eruption is coming out. He directs the chamber to\r\nbe sprinkled with cold water, and even at a certain stage permits the\r\npatient to go into the cold bath. He recommends abstinence from new milk,\r\nwine, dates, honey, mutton, beef, shell-fish, and all high-seasoned and\r\nheating things. The rest of his general treatment we need not give in\r\ndetail. Suffice it to say, that the medicines recommended by him are,\r\nfor the most part, vegetable acids and astringents. Upon the whole, the\r\nearlier part of his treatment consists of bleeding, cold drinks, and\r\nacid draughts. For hastening the eruption, when that is desirable, he\r\ndirects us to wrap up the patient closely in clothes; to rub his body\r\nall over; to keep him in a room not very cold; to give him some cold\r\nwater to drink; to put on a double shirt; and to place near him two\r\nsmall basins of very hot water, one before and the other behind him,\r\nso that the vapour may be diffused all over his body, except the face;\r\nbut he prudently directs us not to allow the moisture to cool upon the\r\nbody, but to get it carefully wiped off. All furnaces and hot baths he\r\ncondemns, as overheating and weakening. He very much commends figs for\r\npromoting the eruption. He afterwards gives very minute directions about\r\nthe treatment of particular parts, such as the eyes, the throat, and the\r\nnose. For the eyes, he recommends various astringent lotions or collyria,\r\nsuch as galls and rose-water, sumach, pomegranate rind, &c. The care of\r\nthe throat he justly holds to be a very important consideration, and\r\nrecommends bleeding when there is acute pain, and gargling with cold\r\nwater, or with astringent decoctions, such as those of acid pomegranates,\r\nsumach, and the juice of mulberries. When the pustules on the limbs are\r\nlarge, he directs us to open them; and when there is great pain in the\r\nsoles, he recommends them to be rubbed with warm oil, or the feet to be\r\nput into hot water. When the pustules seem to stand in need of ripening,\r\nhe directs the body to be fomented with the steam arising from a hot\r\ndecoction of chamomile, violets, and the like; and, when too humid, the\r\npatient is to be laid on pounded roses, rice-meal, or millet seed. For\r\nremoving the scabs and eschars, he recommends us to rub them with the\r\nwarm oil of sesame, or oil of pistaches; but the larger are to be cut\r\noff carefully without any application of oil. For removing the specks\r\non the eye he recommends many stimulant collyria, containing antimony,\r\nverdigris, sal ammoniac, tutty, camphor, &c. For removing cicatrices\r\nor marks on other parts of the body, he mentions various applications,\r\ncontaining litharge, bastard spurge, &c. When the belly is loose, either\r\nin smallpox or measles, which, as he remarks, is commonly the case on the\r\ndecline of the fever, he recommends abstinence from all laxative things,\r\nand commends barley-gruel, to which the meal of pomegranate seeds may be\r\nadded; or, if the looseness increase, gum arabic, &c. may be added to the\r\ndrink. He adds, that it sometimes happens that the bowels require to be\r\nopened, and he directs this to be done by means of myrobalans, prunes,\r\nand the like. When in measles there is much appearance of vitiated\r\nbile, he directs the discharge of it to be promoted. He points out the\r\ndifference between distinct and confluent smallpox; and remarks that the\r\nlatter is far more dangerous than the other. He also correctly states\r\nthat when, in measles or smallpox, the eruption is suddenly determined\r\ninwardly, it is a fatal symptom. He all along inculcates that measles and\r\nsmallpox are nearly allied to each other.\r\n\r\nGeorgius, one of the authorities quoted in his ‘Continens,’ says that\r\nmeasles arise from blood mixed with much bile, and smallpox from\r\ngross blood mixed with much humidity. He states that the danger is\r\nproportionate to the pain in the throat and difficulty of breathing. The\r\nelder Serapion, as quoted by him in the same work, directs, if it is the\r\nwinter season, the wood of tamarisk, &c. to be burned beside the patient.\r\n\r\nIn his work ‘Ad Mansorem,’ he recommends nearly the same treatment as\r\nthat which we have been detailing from his Tractatus on Smallpox; but\r\ndoes not speak so decidedly in favour of cold drink.\r\n\r\nAvicenna’s description of smallpox and measles is very similar to that\r\nof Rhases. He confidently pronounces them to be contagious diseases. He\r\nstates correctly, that when smallpox proves fatal, it is usually from\r\nthe affection of the throat, or from the bowels becoming ulcerated.\r\nSometimes, he adds, the disease superinduces bloody urine. He agrees\r\nwith Rhases that measles is a bilious affection, and that it differs\r\nfrom smallpox only in this, that in the former the morbific matter is in\r\nsmaller quantity, and does not pass the cuticle. His treatment also is\r\nlittle different. At any period during the first four days he approves\r\nof venesection, but forbids it afterwards. He recommends cooling and\r\ndiluent draughts prepared from tamarinds and the like. He prescribes\r\nfigs to facilitate the eruption of the pustules, and forbids cold drink\r\nafter they begin to come out. When the pustules are large and fully\r\nformed, he approves of letting out their contents with a gold needle. His\r\ntreatment of the throat, eyes, belly, and hands is nearly the same as\r\nthat recommended by Rhases. When ulcers are formed after the falling off\r\nof the eschars, he directs them to be dressed with the white ointment,\r\ncomposed of ceruse and litharge. (iii, 1, 4.)\r\n\r\nSerapion’s account of smallpox and measles, as is remarked by Haly Abbas,\r\nis very defective. He treats of them along with apostemes, and his\r\ndescription of the symptoms is far from being accurate.\r\n\r\nAvenzoar, in his Treatise on Epidemical Diseases, treats incidentally of\r\nmeasles and smallpox, for the cure of which he recommends principally\r\ngentle purgatives, such as tamarinds, with cooling and acid drinks. (iii,\r\n3, 4.)\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius also mentions them briefly among the pestilential diseases;\r\nbut his description of them is not to be compared with that of Rhases.\r\n\r\nAccording to Haly Abbas, variola is produced either by external causes,\r\nsuch as a pestilential state of the atmosphere, or from respiring the air\r\nof a place which has been tainted with the effluvia from the pustules of\r\npersons affected with the disease; or it may arise from an ebullition of\r\nthe blood when it is loaded with gross humours which nature endeavours\r\nto cast outwards. He then briefly describes several varieties of the\r\ndisease, differing from one another in degrees of malignity; and among\r\nthem he ranks rubeola, which is occasioned, he says, by a hot thin blood,\r\nand is not of a bad nature. In it, he says, the eruption, when at its\r\nheight, resembles millet seeds, or is somewhat larger, the colour is red,\r\nand the pustules discharge nothing. The precursory symptoms of smallpox\r\nare fever, swelling of the face, itching of the nose, inflammation\r\nand redness in the face and other members, heaviness of the head, and\r\nroughness of the throat. (Theor. viii, 14.) With regard to the treatment\r\nof variola and rubeola, he recommends venesection during any of the\r\nfirst three days; or, if the patient be a child, he directs us to apply\r\na cupping instrument to the back. The patient is then to be made to\r\ndrink barley-water in which jujubes and sebesten plums have been boiled;\r\nsyrup of poppies is to be added, if the cough be troublesome, or the\r\npain of the throat severe; and spoon-meats prepared with spinage, orach,\r\nand the like, are to be given. When the eruption does not come properly\r\nout, he recommends a decoction of fennel, lentils, figs, &c. to be taken\r\ncold.—By the way, this practice is favorably mentioned by Fracastorius, a\r\nwriter of the 16th century (De Morb. Cont.) For asperity in the chest he\r\nrecommends the mucilage of fleawort, linseed, and the like, and forbids\r\nall heating things. The patient is to be kept upon a low diet, as in\r\nother fevers; and his apartment is to be fumigated with aromatics, such\r\nas sandal-wood, myrtles, and roses. When the belly is constipated, he\r\ndirects barley-water with manna, prunes, and the like; or, if loose,\r\nbarley-water with myrtle seeds, gum Arabic, Armenian, or Cretan earth\r\n(chalk?). He forbids purgatives after the seventh day, especially in\r\nrubeola, as there is danger of diarrhœa or dysentery being superinduced;\r\nand, if these affections should come on, he directs them to be stopped\r\nwith astringents. He recommends particular attention to the eyes at the\r\ncommencement, and with this intention directs them to be bathed with an\r\nastringent decoction. No animal food is to be allowed until the eruption\r\nand heat are gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.—ON AFFECTIONS OF THE HAIR, ALOPECIA, OPHIASIS, AND BALDNESS.\r\n\r\nAs some plants die from dryness for want of sap, and some from the sap\r\nbeing unsuitable to them, so it happens, in like manner, with the hairs;\r\nfor baldness is occasioned by want of the natural juices, and alopecia\r\nand ophiasis by the badness of them. These complaints differ only in\r\nfigure; for, in the latter, the affected part has the appearance of a\r\nserpent; and alopecia derives its appellation from the circumstance\r\nof foxes being frequently subject to the affection. Judging of the\r\nprevailing humour, then, from the colour of the skin, we are first to\r\nevacuate it by purging, and then to have recourse to local applications.\r\nIf, therefore, the colour incline to black or white, we purge with the\r\nmedicine called hiera, which evacuates both phlegm and the melancholic\r\nhumour; but if it is palish, we give pills of aloes. An account of these\r\nmedicines will be found in that part of our work which treats of Compound\r\nMedicines. After general depletion, we are to use masticatories composed\r\nof vinegar, mustard, and honey, and not once only, but frequently. It\r\nwill be better, too, if marjoram, pennyroyal, thyme, or hyssop be infused\r\nin the vinegar. In all the other complaints of the head, the same method\r\nis to be observed, first evacuating the prevailing humour, either by\r\npurging, or by phlebotomy if there be also a fulness of blood, and then\r\nproceeding to the topical treatment.\r\n\r\n_On alopecia._ Having first cleansed the part with nitre (_soda_), and\r\nscrubbed it with a rough cloth, more particularly a woollen cloth, and\r\ncontinued the friction until it become red, anoint it with vervain\r\npounded with vinegar in the sun. Or, rub in the roughest alcyonium burnt\r\nand pounded with lamp-oil. Or, burn the root of the club-rush, or the\r\nrind of the bitter almond, and rub them in with oil or bears’ grease.\r\nThese are moderate remedies. But stronger applications may be prepared\r\nfrom euphorbium, thapsia, and adarce, pounded with oil of bays, or liquid\r\npitch.—_Another_: Having burnt the shells of sea-urchins, mix them with\r\nbears’ grease, and anoint with them, having first cleansed the part with\r\nnitre.—_Another_: Of pepper, of dried sheep’s dung, of hedge mustard, of\r\nrocket seeds, of each dr. iv; of white hellebore, dr. iij; of mouse-dung,\r\ndr. j: add to the gall of a bull, of a goat, or of a hog.—_Another tried\r\nremedy for alopecia_: Of the root of mandragora, of birthwort, of the\r\nroot of wake-robin, of wax, of liquid pitch, oz. viij; of swine’s seam\r\nnot salted, of the heart or inner part of the herb nerium a little: boil\r\nthe seam and the nerium until the herb be softened; then strain and throw\r\naway the herb, and add to the axunge the other ingredients, and boil. Add\r\nthe wax and the liquid pitch, and use boldly in the sun. When the ulcers\r\nare cicatrized, burn the head of a fox, take alcyonium, the leaves of\r\nthe black alkanet, and, having pounded all together, sprinkle upon the\r\nointment, in order to promote the growth of the hair.—_Another_: Of a\r\nmouse’s head burnt, one part; of the shells of the sea-urchin, one part;\r\nboil in a pot with swine’s seam, and use. They may also be sprinkled in\r\npowder.\r\n\r\n_A medicament from Thapsia, for all chronic affections._ Of euphorbium,\r\nof thapsia, of bay-berries, of each, oz. j; of native sulphur, oz. ss.;\r\nof hellebore, oz. ss; of wax, oz. viij; of oil of bays, or old castor\r\noil, q. s. When stronger applications are required, add of cardamom, oz.\r\nj; of burnt alcyonium, oz. j; and it will be applicable not only for\r\nalopecia, but for all cases of chronic coldness. But in every case of\r\nalopecia have recourse in the first place to the process of cleansing\r\nwith nitre, then friction, and frequent shaving. I have seen many have\r\ntheir hair reproduced by friction alone, and frequent shaving.\r\n\r\n_For baldness, and to promote the growth of the hair, from Crito._ Take\r\nthe dried stomachs of five hares, roast carefully in an earthen vessel,\r\nadd to them the third part of myrtle tops, of the fruit of acacia, of the\r\njuice of acacia, of sweetbriar, an equal part, of maiden hair, oz. iij;\r\npound all these things together, and sift through a small sieve. Then\r\nadding of bears’ grease, lb. iv, of that of a seal the same quantity,\r\npound and preserve in a leaden vessel. At the time of using add to any\r\nfragrant ointment.\r\n\r\n_Preservatives of the hair._ Of maiden-hair, one part; of ladanum,\r\ntwo parts; add to wine and myrtle oil, and use.—_Another_: Pound the\r\nflower of anemone, and rub it in with oil. The same will blacken the\r\nhair.—_Another_: Pound the straight vervain dried with its roots, sift\r\nthrough a narrow sieve, and, having mixed with oil, so as to have the\r\nthickness of the bath-sordes, lay it up in a copper vessel, and, when\r\nsoftened, use instead of oil in like manner.\r\n\r\n_A watery infusion for increasing the growth of the hairs, and for\r\nblackening them._ Of rain water, six sextarii; of Alexandrian sumach,\r\nthree sextarii; of maiden-hair, oz. iv; of savin, oz. iv; of ladanum, oz.\r\nj; of dried gourd, oz. j; of myrtle, oz. j; allow to macerate in a glass\r\nvessel for twenty days, stirring it twice a day with a pine spatula. On\r\nthe following day plunge the comb into the infusion, and use once a day.\r\nAnd the seed of marshmallows, when rubbed in while in a bath, preserves\r\nthe hair and promotes its growth. And, in like manner, oil may be rubbed\r\nin that has had the seed of marsh-mallows boiled in it, or added to it.\r\n\r\n_For thinning the hair._ Of the leaves of the fig-tree, of the rind\r\nof the white wild vine, of pumice-stone, of the shells of buccinæ, of\r\nCimolian earth, of each one mina. Put them into a new crude pot, and\r\nhaving covered it with clay, burn in a furnace, and pound, adding of\r\naphronitrum half a mina, of the galls called omphacitæ thirty in number,\r\npulverize and use.—_Another_: Of aphronitrum, half a mina; of roasted\r\npumice-stone, four minæ; of fissile alum (_alumen scissile_), of dried\r\niris, of the black wild myrtle, of gum, of the root of bryony, of each\r\ndr. iv; of unripe lupines pounded, the fourth part of a gallon; use\r\nwithout tallow.\r\n\r\n_For falling out of the hair._ Rub in aloes, with black austere wine; or,\r\nthe cover of the purpura boiled with oil; or, myrrh and ladanum, with\r\nwine and myrtle oil; or, pound burnt sheep’s dung on a shell, and rub it\r\nin with oil, having first shaved the head.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY.

He says that the disease is occasioned either\r\nby the deficiency or depravity of the nutritive juices. Drs. Willan\r\nand Bateman describe this complaint by the name of porrigo decalvans.\r\nBateman justly remarks, that, “all that can be prescribed respecting\r\nthe treatment of this affection has been expressed by Celsus with his\r\nusual terseness: “Quidam hæc genera arearum scalpello exasperant;\r\nquidam illinunt adurentia ex oleo, maximèque chartam combustam; quidam\r\nresinam terebinthinam cum thapsia inducunt. Sed nihil melius est quam\r\nnovaculâ quotidie radere, quia, cum paulatim summa pellicula excisa\r\nest, adaperiuntur pilorum radiculæ.

Octavius\r\nHoratianus, after directing pills containing colocynth, aloes, scammony,\r\nand wormwood, recommends nearly the same external treatment as Celsus:\r\n“Omnes confectiones quæ mediocriter calefacere possunt, mediocribus et\r\ndelicatioribus corporibus adhibendæ sunt. Prius ergo loca linteolo usque\r\nad ruborem ante curam confricentur mediocriter, ne vulnerentur. Quæ si\r\nvulnerabuntur, oleo roseo, vel adipibus anserinis recuranda sunt.”\r\n\r\nDioscorides recommends tar-water and other preparations of pitch for\r\nalopecia.\r\n\r\nIn a Fragment of an anonymous author, published along with ‘Moschion’\r\nin the ‘Gynæcia,’ very sensible rules of treatment are given; namely,\r\nto shave the part frequently, to rub it with compositions containing\r\nmustard, adarce, wormwood, alcyonium, &c., and to purge with aloes,\r\nscammony, colocynth, and the like. Similar directions are given by\r\nHeliodorus. Even Alexander, who in general controverts freely the\r\nopinions of Galen, does not differ from him at all in this case. He lays\r\ndown the treatment of baldness very systematically, according as the\r\nfalling off of the hairs arises from preternatural dryness of the part,\r\nor from contraction or expansion of the pores, or whether it proceed from\r\nthe purging of the system from depraved humours. In the first of these\r\ncases he recommends baths, and a moistening diet, but forbids the use of\r\nastringent applications. For preternatural openness or relaxation of the\r\npores he recommends applications of an astringent and bracing nature,\r\nand strongly nourishing food. For preternatural contraction of the pores\r\nhe advises the opposite class of remedies. When the hairs fall out owing\r\nto the cleansing of the system from depraved humours, as happens after\r\ndiseases, he cautions against a too meddlesome interference with the\r\nprocess of nature. Aëtius and Oribasius are the servile copyists of\r\nGalen. Marcellus gives a long list of compound medicines for the cure of\r\nalopecia. Pliny recommends bull’s gall with Egyptian nitre. The ancients\r\nwere in the practice of using nitre for cleaning linen, as is remarked by\r\nBernard (ad Nonnum, u. s.) On the ancient practice of scrubbing the head\r\nwith nitre or soda, see Salmasius (ad Tertull. de Pallio, 432.)\r\n\r\nThe Pseudo-Dioscorides recommends shaving, rubbing with nitre, and\r\nstimulant applications containing arsenic. (Euporist.)\r\n\r\nThe Arabians treat the disease exactly as the Greeks. Avenzoar recommends\r\npurging, a regulated diet, and friction with oil of nuts and cherva.\r\nHaly Abbas approves of general evacuants, friction, and stimulant\r\napplications containing cantharides, nitre, &c. Alsaharavius recommends\r\nemetics after food, purging with hiera picra, friction with compositions\r\ncontaining mustard, euphorbium, pellitory, nettle-seed, with oil of\r\nsesame, or with liquid pitch. Ophiasis, he says, is to be treated upon\r\nthe same principles. Among the ingredients of Mesue’s compositions,\r\nwe remark cantharides, musk, and amber. Serapion, like Galen and some\r\nof the others, makes mention of red arsenic as an ingredient in these\r\napplications. Rhases, in his ‘Continens,’ collects the opinions of all\r\npreceding authorities on the nature and treatment of these diseases.\r\nMost of the local applications recommended by them are stimulants and\r\nrubefacients, such as mastich, euphorbium, cantharides, ladanum, St.\r\nJohn’s-wort, &c. which are to be rubbed in with oil or pitch. He mentions\r\nthat the celebrated Antyllus recommended scarifications, cupping, and\r\nleeching. Servitor directs a depilatory, prepared by mixing two parts\r\nof quicklime with one of arsenic in a crucible or mortar, and adding\r\na little water to them. Pliny, Samonicus, Marcellus Empericus, and\r\nother ancient authorities speak highly of bear’s grease for the cure of\r\nbaldness.\r\n\r\nFor the cure of ophiasis the earlier modern surgeons recommended\r\ndepilatories containing arsenic, quicklime, vitriol, hellebore, and the\r\nlike. One described by Rolandus consists of quicklime and arsenic boiled\r\nin water. (i, 14.) A similar one is described by Plempius.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.—FOR MAKING THE HAIR CURLED, AND FOR DYEING IT. FROM CLEOPATRA.\r\n\r\nHaving first scrubbed the head, anoint the hair with the root of\r\ncow-parsnip in undiluted wine.—_Another_: Having shaved the head,\r\nand scrubbed it, take a young pine kernel, and burn it until it be\r\nreduced to ashes, put it into a mortar and pulverize it, adding myrtle\r\nointment, until it be of the thickness of honey, and thus anoint the\r\nhead with it.—_Another_: Rub in equal parts of myrtles and beet, with\r\noil.—_Another_: Twenty galls; of maiden-hair, oz. ij; pound with\r\nsea-water until they attain the thickness of honey. Having rubbed the\r\nhair with urine, or lixivial ashes, and cleaned it with warm water,\r\nanoint it with this medicine for two days, then stopping, on the third\r\nday clean it, and, having shaved, anoint with myrtle oil. This will\r\nrender the hair smooth, and curled, and black; but it will be more curled\r\nif you shave before using it.\r\n\r\n_Preservatives of hoary hairs, and other compositions for dyeing them\r\nblack._ Of the oil of unripe olives, three sextarii; of spikenard, dr.\r\nj; of unguis aromaticus (sweet-hoof?), dr. iv; of schænanth, dr. iv.\r\nBoil with oil, and separately pound and dissolve carefully one ounce of\r\nthe juice of acacia in wine. When only a third part of the oil remains,\r\nstrain it, and mixing with the acacia, lay it up in a vessel, and anoint\r\nwith it every day.—_Another_: Of the bark of green walnuts, oz. iij; of\r\nthe root of the ilex, oz. iij; of dark-coloured wine, three sextarii;\r\nboil to a third part, and, having strained, pound the remainder with one\r\nsextarius of myrtle oil. To be used every day.\r\n\r\n_An infusion for dyeing the hair black._ Of galls, one sextarius, of\r\nelm-leaved sumach (_rhus coriaria_), two sextarii; of the leaves of\r\nprivet, an equal quantity; of black myrtle leaves, the same; of cinnaris\r\na handful; of poppy-heads the same; of lake water, twelve sextarii.\r\nMacerate for many days, boil to a third, then rub and anoint the head.\r\nWhen the hairs are dry anoint with an acetabulum of Cimolian earth, and\r\nan equal quantity of quicklime. Dissolving these things in the juice of\r\nboiled beet, anoint with it, and then, for the sake of protection, put\r\nover it the leaves of beet, and, when they adhere properly, wash in the\r\nbath with it.\r\n\r\n_For dyeing tawny hairs, and making them of a bright yellow colour._ Take\r\nof myrrh, one part; of the flower of salt, one part; pulverize carefully,\r\nand, having made it of the thickness of the sordes of a bath, scrub the\r\nhead, anoint it with the ointment, and allow it to remain a night and a\r\nday, and then order it to be wiped off.—_Another_: Rub in unripe lupines\r\nwith water.—_Another_: Of litharge, dr. j; of Cretan earth, dr. iv; of\r\nquicklime, dr. j; with water make to the thickness of bath sordes, and\r\nanoint. Apply the leaves of beet for two or three days, and then clean.\r\n\r\n_For making black hairs yellow._ Add the lees of wine to the sordes\r\nof a bath, and, having made it to the consistence of cerate, use it\r\nwhen you are going to sleep, and in the morning the hairs will be\r\nyellow.—_Another_: Macerate the leaves of privet in the juice of Fuller’s\r\nherb (_struthium_), and use the infusion.\r\n\r\n_A gold-coloured dye._ Of alum, dr. vj; of red arsenic, dr. vj; of\r\nsaffron, dr. ij; of the thapsus used by dyers, called _herba rubia_ by\r\nthe Romans, dr. viij; of the lixivial ashes used by the bonnet-makers,\r\nfour sextarii; boil the ashes and the thapsus pounded together, and,\r\nwhen but one half remains, squeeze out the juice, and dissolve in it\r\nthe alum, red arsenic, and saffron; put it into a glass vessel, and, at\r\nthe time of using, first scrub the head, and then anoint with it. When\r\nit is all drunk up, clean with the decoction of fenugreek, barley, and\r\ncumin, having previously washed them with a sufficiency of tepid water,\r\nand add as much soap as is required.—_Another_: Mixing together the burnt\r\nlees of wine and the oil used in the baths, anoint the hairs.—_Another_:\r\nScrub with Gallic soap and water at each bath.—_Another very fine_:\r\nOf red sumach, one sextarius; of galls, lb. iss; of sheep’s dung, oz.\r\nij; of the golden-coloured herb, called _rubia_ by the Romans, oz. ij;\r\nof maiden-hair, two bunches (_fasciculi_); of wormwood, one bunch;\r\nof lupines stripped of their outer coat, two cyathi; of water, six\r\nsextarii; put all into a glass vessel, and allow to macerate for nine\r\ndays, stirring it twice a day. At the time of using, strain out what is\r\nrequired, and, soaking a sponge in it, rub the hairs, and when they are\r\nmoistened allow them to drink it up. When dried, wash with a solution of\r\nsoap in warm water.\r\n\r\n_For making the hairs white._ Burn the flowers of the white\r\npetty-mullein, moisten with vinegar, and mix for a detergent\r\nointment.—_Another_: Of the fruit of petty-mullein, dr. j; of alum, dr.\r\nj; of the rind of radishes, dr. j; pound, and mix of bull’s glue, dr. iv.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen, when about to treat of compositions for the hair,\r\nremarks that the application of these does not belong properly to the\r\nphysician, but that he may sometimes be obliged to furnish them to _royal\r\nladies_, whom, under certain circumstances, he cannot venture to disobey.\r\nThat the ladies, in ancient times, were in the practice of painting their\r\nhair, is evident from Achilles Tatius (ii, 149), and Juvenal (vi, 354.)\r\nEustathius mentions that antimony was very much used for painting the\r\neyebrows black. (Comment. in Iliad, viii, _versus finem_.)\r\n\r\nFor further information upon this subject, with which we must confess\r\nourselves wholly unacquainted, we refer the reader to the following\r\nworks: Alexander (i, 3); Oribasius (iv, 7, 8); Aëtius (vi, 58); Nonnus\r\n(2, 3); Octavius Horatianus (i, 1); Avicenna (iv, 7, 1); Alsaharavius\r\n(Pract. xvii, 7); Rhases (ad Mansor. v, and Contin. xxxvi.) Vegetius, the\r\ngreat authority on Veterinary Surgery, gives prescriptions for dyeing the\r\nhair of cattle. (Mulom. ii.)\r\n\r\nThe thapsus mentioned in this Section occurs in Theocritus (Idyl. ii,\r\n88,) and is said by the scholiast to be a Scythian wood for dyeing the\r\nhair. It also occurs in Nicander (Ther. l, 529). His metaphrasist,\r\nEutecnius, says that it grows in Sicily. Lucan, in like manner, calls\r\nit _Erycina thapsus_, i. e. Sicilian thapsus. (Pharsal. ix, 916.) It is\r\nimpossible to determine exactly what tree it was.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of the philosophers regarding the hair may be learned\r\nfrom Aristotle (H. A. iii), and Pliny (H. N. xi, 94.) Both state that\r\nthe hair and also the nails grow after death; and Philoponus mentions\r\nthis circumstance as a well-known fact. See Comment. in Aristot. de\r\nAnima, Præfat. It may be proper to mention that Bichat and other modern\r\nphysiologists have been of the same opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.—ON PITYRIASIS.\r\n\r\nPityriasis is an eruption of small furfuraceous substances on the skin of\r\nthe head, or the rest of the body, without ulceration. It is occasioned,\r\neither by depraved humours which have been determined to the head, or by\r\na saltish phlegm, or by bilious or melancholic blood. After the general\r\nsystem has been evacuated, as formerly described, we must use some of the\r\nunder-mentioned remedies. Having first macerated Cimolian earth in water,\r\nmix with the juice of beet, and anoint it, allowing it to remain until\r\ndry, then wash it away, and, having pounded frankincense with wine and\r\noil, anoint with them. Next day, rub in stavesacre with oil.—_Another_:\r\nOf nitre, of the burnt lees of wine, of ben-nut, of each, lb. j; of\r\nstavesacre, lb. iss. Dissolve in wine, and rub the head; or, if the rest\r\nof the body be affected with tingling, it may be used dry. When the\r\npityriasis is more humid, wash with brine or the decoction of lupines. Of\r\nthis remedy I have had ample experience.\r\n\r\n_On psydracia and exanthemata of the head._ The psydracia are small\r\nprotuberances, like blisters, elevated above the skin. The exanthemata\r\nare superficial ulcerations, somewhat red and rough. Both are to be cured\r\nby the under-mentioned remedies: Of litharge, dr. ij; of ceruse, dr. iv;\r\nof alum dr. ij: of the green leaves of rue, dr. ij; pound with vinegar\r\nand myrtle-oil, and anoint.—_Another_: Pounding rue and alum with honey,\r\nanoint with this the head, after having first shaved it. If the head is\r\nexcoriated, apply olive leaves boiled with honey.—_Another_: Of litharge\r\nand ceruse, of each, dr. xij; of native sulphur, dr. viij; mix with\r\nmyrtle cerate.\r\n\r\n_For the thick and red ulcers of the head, resembling papulæ, or small\r\nnipples, from which ichor is discharged._ Having first shaved the head\r\nand scrubbed it with water and nitre, use native sulphur livigated with\r\nhuman urine; or anoint with melanteria and vinegar.\r\n\r\n_For achores and favi._ The complaint called achor is one of those\r\nwhich affect the skin of the head, corroding the skin by very small\r\nperforations, from which a discharge of viscid humour takes place. The\r\ncomplaint called favus is nearly allied to it in appearance, since it\r\nconsists of larger perforations resembling the combs of bees, containing\r\na honey-like fluid. They are occasioned by a nitrous and saltish phlegm.\r\nIn such cases, the diet should consist of wholesome food; and everything\r\nthat is acrid and saltish should be avoided, more particularly if the\r\nattack be inflammatory. After the proper evacuation of the prevailing\r\nhumour, having shaved the hairs, foment twice, thrice, or oftener, with\r\nwarm water, in which has been boiled myrtle, bramble, or lentil, or\r\nbitter lupines, or the root of asparagus. When the ichorous discharge is\r\ngreater, apply a cataplasm of the leaves of willow, with water, or of\r\nlentil. The ointments used should consist of Cimolian, Cretan, or Samian\r\nearth, or pompholyx, or spodium, or litharge, or cadmia, or burnt paper,\r\nor the powder from pepper. All these are to be applied with vinegar. We\r\nmay use the following smegma: Of sulphur, of the herb perdicias, and\r\nsoap, of each equal parts. The following are compound applications: Of\r\nlitharge, dr. xvj; of the leaves of rue, dr. viij; of the stavesacre,\r\ndr. iv; of copperas, dr. ij; with vinegar and myrtle oil; make to the\r\nconsistence of bath-sordes, and anoint with it.—_Another_: Of sandyx\r\n(_calcined ceruse?_), dr. iv; of myrrh, dr. iv; of native sulphur, dr.\r\nij; of manna, dr. iv; rub into the part with old oil.\r\n\r\n_For achores._ When they discharge ichor, triturate the dross of silver,\r\nor yellow ore of lead (_molybdœna_), and sprinkle upon them.—_Another,\r\nfor achores and humid psora_: Of the roses of the rhododaphne, oz. iv; of\r\nnative sulphur, oz. iv; of liquid pitch, oz. iij; of dry pitch, oz. iij;\r\nof wax, oz. vj; of myrtle oil, q. s. For children, dissolve in milk, and\r\nanoint.\r\n\r\n_For fici._ We give the name of fici to ulcerous excrescences which are\r\nround, somewhat hard, red, and accompanied with pain. They arise for the\r\nmost part on the head, but also sometimes on the other parts of the body.\r\nThe best application for this complaint consists of fissile alum, of the\r\ncalcined flowers of copper, of taurocolla, of each equal parts, with\r\ndouble the quantity of the flakes of copper; triturate with vinegar, and\r\nanoint. A proper application is also prepared from the burnt heads of the\r\ncackrel fish, the bulbi boiled, and their ashes mixed with vinegar.\r\n\r\n_A dry application for ficose eruptions of the head and chin._ Of misy,\r\ndr. iss; of chalcitis, dr. iiss; of squama æris, dr. j; of fissile alum,\r\ndr. j. Having washed, apply this powder in a dry state unsparingly, and\r\nallow it to remain. Next day, having again washed, wipe the part with a\r\nsponge, and apply it again. A thick scab will then fall from the ulcer.\r\nRepeat the same application the following days. The cure will be effected\r\nin a few days without leaving a cicatrix; but this medicine operates\r\nstrongly.\r\n\r\n_For lice in the head._ Direct the head to be scrubbed with the decoction\r\nof lupines; or pound together stavesacre and sandarach, and rub them in\r\nalong with oil or vinegar; or a small quantity of pepper may be added to\r\nold oil, so as not to occasion ulceration; or the juice of ivy with honey\r\nmay be used; or mustard and vinegar; or the gum vernix, or liquid pitch\r\nwith alum; or the expressed juice of the bay berries; or oil of radishes.\r\nI have always succeeded by pounding stavesacre with vinegar and oil, and\r\nanointing with this.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Drs. Willan and Bateman agree with all the best medical\r\nwriters of antiquity in describing, by the name of _pityriasis_, a\r\ndisease consisting of slight, scaly, and branny exfoliations without\r\nulceration. See Galen (Sec. Loc. i); Alexander (i, 3); Oribasius (Synops.\r\nvi, 25); Aëtius (vi, 66); Actuarius (de Sig. Morb. ii, 5); Nonnus (4.)\r\nActuarius, who gives a very distinct account of the disease, states in\r\nstrong terms the danger of repressing the cutaneous eruption. (l. c.)\r\n\r\nIt is the _porrigo sicca_ of Celsus (vi, 2), who recommends for it\r\nshaving the head, and using slightly repressing applications, “quale est\r\nnitrum cum aceto, vel ladanum cum myrteo et vino, vel myrobalanum cum\r\nvino.” Marcellus distinguishes the pityriasis from porrigo. (De Med. 4.)\r\n\r\nThe Arabians, especially Serapion, direct very active general treatment,\r\nsuch as venesection, masticatories, cathartics, and the like. (i, 4.)\r\nIt is described under the name of _furfures capitis_ by the translator\r\nof Haly Abbas. (Theor. viii, 18.) Like the Greeks, he represents\r\nit as consisting of small furfuraceous scales without ulceration.\r\nAlsaharavius uses the same name, and recommends bleeding, cupping,\r\npurging, and external applications of a detergent nature, such as flour\r\nof vetches, with vinegar and the like. Avenzoar recommends pills of\r\ndrastic purgatives, and the ordinary lotions. (i, 1, 10.) See also\r\nAvicenna (iv, 7, 1, 24); and Rhases (ad Mansor. v, 1; Contin. xxxvi.)\r\nIn the ‘Continens,’ the disease is described by the names of furfures\r\nand impetigo, for which Rhases recommends liniments containing nitre,\r\nsulphur, hellebore, vinegar, &c.\r\n\r\nWillan and Bateman describe the _psydracia_ as being small pustules\r\nirregularly circumscribed and terminating in a laminated scab. Most\r\nof the above-mentioned writers treat of them in the same terms as our\r\nauthor. They seem to be the _balchie_ of Avicenna (iv, 7, 6, 1) who calls\r\nthem a malignant species of achor. See Galen (l. c.)\r\n\r\nGalen, Alexander, Aëtius, and our author describe the _exanthemata_ as\r\nbeing small superficial ulcerations. Drs. Willan and Bateman use it as\r\na generic term for rashes. The exanthemata seem to be the _alraba_ or\r\n_pustulæ dulces_ of Alsaharavius (i, 10.) See Book First, Sect. VI, and\r\nBook Fourth, Sect. VIII, of this Work.\r\n\r\nWillan and Bateman apply the terms _achor_ and _favus_ in the same sense\r\nas Paulus and the other ancient authors. Octavius Horatianus uses the\r\nterms acora and cerio. He says, “Acoræ et ceriones distant, quod ceriones\r\nplures cavernas egestionis habent et humorem multo pinguiorem emittunt;\r\nacora autem unam cavernam habet, et humorem egerit aquatiorem.” (i, 5.)\r\nGalen has treated of these complaints very fully, and his applications\r\nare similar to those of our author. See also most of the authorities\r\non pityriasis. The favus is the first species of _tinea_ described by\r\nHaly Abbas. It consists, he says, of cells, and discharges a fluid-like\r\nhoney. The achor is his _amada_, or third species of _tinea_, consisting\r\nof smaller cells than the former. Alsaharavius describes the favus by\r\nthe name of _alsahara_. It contains, he says, a viscid fluid like honey.\r\nHe recommends for it purgatives, and detergent applications containing\r\nnitre, lees of wine, &c. (Pract. i, 9.) The achor is called _alsahafa_ by\r\nhim. The description which Actuarius gives of papulæ, favus, and ficus is\r\nsufficiently distinct, but not different from our author’s. (De Diagnos.\r\nii, 5.)\r\n\r\nThe other authorities gives the same account of _ficus_ as Paulus. It\r\nis Haly Abbas’ second species of _tinea_, and is described by him as\r\nconsisting of hard round protuberances. Haly’s fourth species of _tinea_\r\nconsists of small ulcers of a mammiform appearance. They are mentioned\r\nby our author. Fabricius ab Aquapendente defines the ficus thus:\r\n“Tumeur qui est rouge, ronde, quelque peu dure, et de laquelle (etant\r\nulcérée et pressée) sort une matière sanieuse, semblable aux grains de\r\nfigues.” (Œuv. Chir. i, 1, 13.) He says that Hippocrates and Galen give\r\na different account of it from our author’s; but we can see very little\r\ndifference between them. Most of the ancient authors recommend the same\r\nremedies for ficus as Paulus. The most active of these are stavesacre,\r\nand sandarach or red sulphuret of arsenic. They do not appear to have\r\napprehended danger from the free use of arsenic in this way. Galen\r\nrecommends equal parts of white hellebore, stavesacre, and nitre with\r\noil. (De Med. Sec. Loc. i.) Octavius Horatianus mentions equal parts of\r\npellitory and galls. The same medicines are recommended by Serapion, (i,\r\n5.) See also Oribasius (de Loc. Affect. iv, 11); Celsus (xi, 3); Cælius\r\nAurelianus (de Morb. Tard. iv, 2.) Haly’s remedies consist of galls,\r\nlitharge, mercury _killed_ (sublimed?), sulphur, and so forth. Among\r\nthose of Rhases we remark squills, assafœtida, quicklime, mercury, &c.\r\nHowever, he prefers excision. (Continens. xxxvi).\r\n\r\nFor pediculi in the head, the Arabians recommend nearly the same\r\ncompositions as our author. They contain arsenic, stavesacre, hellebore,\r\nnitre, and the like. See Alsaharavius (Pract. i, 16), and Phases\r\n(Cont. xxxvi, 6.) Among the ingredients mentioned by the latter, we\r\nremark quicksilver, sulphur, red arsenic, mustard, stavesacre, the\r\noil of oleander, vinegar, &c. These medicines form the ingredients in\r\nthe compositions recommended by modern writers on this complaint. See\r\nPlempius (de Morbis Pilorum), and Amatus Lusitanus (Curat. 58.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IV.—ON HEADACH.\r\n\r\nHeadach, which is one of the most serious complaints, is sometimes\r\noccasioned by an intemperament solely; sometimes by a redundance of\r\nhumours, and sometimes by both; and sometimes it is occasioned by a\r\nprocatarctic cause, such as external heat, or cold, or drunkenness, or\r\na blow. The most vehement pains of the head are excited by the active\r\nqualities, particularly heat. Those occasioned by dryness are not equally\r\nvehement; but a humid quality excites no pain of itself, unless it\r\nhappens to be joined to heat, cold, or a fulness of humours. Headachs\r\noccurring in a fever having been treated of in the preceding Book on\r\nFevers, we will now treat of the others.\r\n\r\n_On headach from heat._ When headach proceeds from exposure to heat,\r\nthe skin feels hotter and drier than natural at the first application\r\nof the hand, and the eyes of such persons are red. They delight in cold\r\naffusions and ointments, and are benefited by them. The method of cure\r\nwill correspond with that described as applicable for cases of headach\r\nin fevers. When the pain becomes chronic, we must have recourse to\r\nsome of the under-mentioned applications. The following applications\r\nto the forehead and temples will also be proper, namely, bread soaked\r\nin oxycrate and rose-oil, to which may sometimes be joined almonds; or\r\nroses either dried or fresh, or mixed with mint and pennyroyal; or bread\r\nwith the leaves of the peach tree. Benefit may also be derived from\r\nbasil, pounded with vinegar and rose-oil; or from ivy berries boiled in\r\nvinegar, and pounded with rose-oil; or from wheaten flour mixed with the\r\nwatery decoction of wild thyme; or from cardamom toasted and triturated\r\nin vinegar and rose-oil; or from leaven with rose-oil; or from dried\r\niris with vinegar. These applications must be changed frequently; for if\r\nallowed to remain long, they have no effect.\r\n\r\n_Trochisks for headach connected with a warm intemperament._ Of saffron,\r\ndr. v; of copperas, dr. x; of alum, dr. xvj; of myrrh, dr. vij; of the\r\noil of unripe olives, dr. iij; of chalcitis, dr. iij; of gum, dr. iij; of\r\naustere wine, _q. s._ Use with oxycrate, and, if watchfulness accompany\r\nit, add some of the soporifics.\r\n\r\n_On headachs from a cold intemperament._ In cases of headachs from\r\ncoldness, the symptoms are just the reverse of those proceeding from\r\nheat; for the face is pale and not contracted, and the patients do not\r\ndelight in cold things, nor are benefited by them. The diagnosis will\r\nalso be confirmed by adverting to their diet, and the like. The ointments\r\napplied should contain rue, or the oil of bay, or of iris, or of nard,\r\nor the juice of balsam, more particularly if the excrementitious humours\r\nbe thick and viscid. This must be rubbed into the forehead, and likewise\r\npreparations containing pepper and euphorbium. Also give thin wines and\r\nrecommend exercise, hot baths, and occasionally an emetic from radishes.\r\nWhen the exciting cause is a chronic quality without plethora, use the\r\nfollowing application: Of white pepper, dr. ij; of crocomagma, dr. ij; of\r\nfresh euphorbium, dr. viiiss; of pigeon’s dung, dr. iss; of the strongest\r\nvinegar, _q. s._ Having first rubbed the affected part, anoint with this.\r\n\r\n_On headachs from a bilious humour._ The symptoms resemble those\r\noccasioned by heat, only there are more gnawing pains at the stomach,\r\npaleness of the countenance, and sometimes a bitter taste in the\r\nmouth. This affection occurs most frequently in adults who are of a\r\nhot temperament, lead an anxious life, and are subject to collections\r\nof yellow bile. They must use tepid baths, and mild ointments, with a\r\nwatery drink; and their whole diet should be moistening, and consist of\r\ngood juices. The bilious humours must be evacuated with the decoction\r\nof wormwood, or with aloes, or the antidote called hiera picra, either\r\nalone, or in combination with a little scammony, or the aloetic pills.\r\nThe forehead is to be rubbed with the saffron trochisk, or with that\r\ncalled trigonos, or the like.\r\n\r\n_On headach from sympathy._ If the head be affected sympathetically\r\nwith the general system, this must be our first care, by attending\r\nto the intemperament and the prevailing matter. If it proceed from\r\nplethora, more especially a venous one, we will bleed; but, if it be\r\nonly an offending quality, we will use a purgative medicine. If the\r\nhead sympathise with some particular part, such as the liver, belly, or\r\nstomach, we must apply remedies to these organs. If a hot intemperament\r\naccompany, we give bread which has been steeped in a watery wine, or\r\nspoon-meats from chondrus. Moderately cooling and tonic applications are\r\nlikewise to be used externally, as formerly described. But if the headach\r\nbe occasioned by viscid and thick humours contained in the stomach, these\r\nmust be dislodged by drinking oxymel, either alone or that preparation\r\ncalled the Julian. We must also use decoctions of hyssop and marjoram,\r\nand other things still hotter and more incisive, and likewise the emetic\r\nfrom radishes, hot embrocations, and cataplasms.\r\n\r\n_On headach from wine._ If the wine remain undigested, we must procure\r\nvomiting, by drinking tepid water; but if the headach remain after\r\ndigestion, we must use cooling and repellent applications, such as\r\nrose-oil alone and with vinegar, or the juice of ivy, or of cabbage. And\r\nthe leaves of cabbage infused in warm water, and applied to and bound to\r\nthe head, naturally counteract intoxication. They must also eat boiled\r\ncabbage. Dried lentil is also beneficial, particularly to those who have\r\na loose belly. They ought likewise to eat alica, pomegranates, apples and\r\npears, and drink water.\r\n\r\n_On headach from a blow._ We must immediately bleed those who have\r\nheadach from a blow (unless the injury be superficial), and use suitable\r\nembrocations to the head; bathe it with sweet oil; cover it with wool;\r\nand make the patients abstain from wine and a rich diet, more especially\r\nif they have fever; and, upon the whole, we are to accommodate our\r\ntreatment as for the inflammation of nervous parts, and especially of\r\nthe membranes of the brain. If there be a wound it must be treated\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n_An emollient application for headach._ Of wax, dr. vij; of almond-oil,\r\noz. iij; of turpentine, dr. viij; of scraped verdigris, of Cimolian\r\nearth, and of chalcitis, of each, dr. iv; of pumice-stone, dr. iij; of\r\nburnt copper and scales of steel (_squamæ stomomatis_), of each dr. ij;\r\nand, if appear to be too hard, soften it with almond-oil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. By cephalalgia, as Aretæus remarks, is to be understood an\r\nacute pain of the head, and by cephalæa a chronic one. Our author does\r\nlittle more than abridge the contents of the second book of Galen’s work\r\n‘De Med. sec. Loc.’, where this subject is treated of with unrivalled\r\nprecision. See also Aretæus (de Morb. Chron. i, 2); Oribasius (de Loc.\r\nAffect. iv, 1); Celsus (iv, 2); Cælius Aurelianus (de Morb. Chron. i,\r\n1); Octavius Horatianus, (ii, 1); Alexander (i, 10); Pseudo-Dioscorides\r\n(Euporist. i, 6); Actuarius (Meth. Med. vi, 2); Aëtius (vi, 40); Leo\r\n(Synops. ii, 1); Nonnus (10); Serapion (i, 6); Avicenna (iii, 1, 2);\r\nAvenzoar (i, 3); Mesue (de Ægr. Capitis, ii, 1); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix,\r\n3, Pract. v); Alsaharavius (Pract. i, 2, 1); Rhases (ad Mansor. ix, 1,\r\nContin. i, 21.)\r\n\r\nIn headach from heat, Galen and Alexander concur in condemning the use of\r\npoppies, hemlock, and mandragora, unless when compelled to have recourse\r\nto them by the continued watchfulness of the patient. Galen directs the\r\napplication of snow to the head. Avenzoar recommends the affusion of\r\ncold liquids from a height upon the head. Serapion mentions oil cooled\r\nwith ice. When the pain is obstinate, Rhases approves of opening the\r\ntemporal artery. When the pain is violent, the author of the ‘Euporista’\r\nrecommends us to shave the head and bathe it with a decoction of narcotic\r\nvegetables. Galen expresses himself very clearly with regard to the\r\nsympathy between the head and the stomach, from nervous communication.\r\n(Loc. affect. iii, 9.)\r\n\r\nFor headachs arising from a hot or cold intemperament, Galen recommends\r\nthe remedies called metasyncritica by the Methodists, for an account of\r\nwhich see Le Clerc. (Hist. de la Méd. ii, iv, 1, 3.) He says, “Ce que\r\nThessalus appelloit metasyncrise etoit un changement qu’ il prétendoit\r\nfaire dans tout le corps, ou dans quelque partie seulement.” Such\r\nrubefacients as mustard, thapsia, &c. belonged to this class. See also\r\nProsper Alpinus (de Med. Method. iii, 15.) The term signifies “altering\r\nthe system;” and, therefore, we have generally rendered it “alteratives”\r\nin the course of this translation. The treatment followed by Philagrius\r\nin the hot and fiery intemperament of the head deserves to be noticed.\r\nIn a case of this description having used many other cooling remedies in\r\nvain, he says he shaved the head and applied snow to it, by which means\r\nhe extinguished the intemperament. (Theophilus, Sch. in Hipp. t. ii, 457,\r\ned. Dietz.) This practice is borrowed from Galen, as above.\r\n\r\nOur author borrows his treatment of bilious headach from Galen and\r\nAlexander. To his judicious account of headach from wine or a blow,\r\nnothing need be added from any other author. Alexander justly remarks\r\nthat, when it arises from the latter cause, it is very dangerous. He is\r\nfuller than our author in treating of headach from sympathy with the\r\nliver, for which he recommends local applications of a cooling nature and\r\na generous diet. Similar treatment, he adds, is to be pursued when it\r\narises from a hot intemperament of the stomach, bowels, or spleen.\r\n\r\nAccording to Avicenna and Actuarius, frothy urine, that is to say, urine\r\nhaving bubbles on the surface, is characteristic of cephalalgia.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians generally treat of the disease by the name of _soda_.\r\n\r\nHeadach, says Haly Abbas, is either seated in the head, or arises\r\nfrom sympathy. When seated in the head, it either arises from an\r\nintemperament, or organic disease, or flatus, or a blow. One of the most\r\ncommon causes of sympathetic headach is the presence of bilious matters\r\nin the stomach, which case is generally relieved by vomiting. Protracted\r\nwatchfulness induces headach, by occasioning a corruption of the food in\r\nthe stomach; and protracted sleep in like manner fills the brain with\r\nvapours. Excessive evacuation, by producing a dry intemperament, proves\r\na cause of headach. It is in this manner that epistaxis and menorrhagia\r\noccasion headach. Haly Abbas, like Galen, mentions as a cause of headach\r\nan excessive sensibility of the nerves which connect the brain and\r\nstomach. Haly further states that headach will arise from sympathy with\r\nthe uterus, as after abortions, obstructions of the lochial or menstrual\r\ndischarge, and the like causes. He remarks that violent headach will\r\nsometimes occasion loss of speech, owing to an affection of the nerve\r\nwhich is distributed upon the muscles of speech. His treatment, like our\r\nauthor’s, is varied according to the nature of the exciting causes; and\r\nhis account of it is so full and judicious, that we regret our limits\r\ndo not permit us to give a more ample detail of it. His remedies are,\r\ngeneral bleeding, cupping the extremities or back part of the neck,\r\nanodyne or cold applications to the head, drastic or gentle purgatives,\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius treats the complaint upon similar principles. When it\r\narises from heat, he recommends the affusion of tepid water over the\r\nhead, and afterwards applies oils cooled in snow. When connected with\r\nbile, he directs the belly to be opened. When it is occasioned by a\r\nsanguineous plethora, he recommends general bleeding and the application\r\nof cupping-instruments to the nape of the neck.\r\n\r\nRhases, as usual, treats fully of _soda_ and all its varieties. When\r\nof an inflammatory nature, he recommends bleeding, purging, and the\r\napplication of vinegar and rose-oil to the head. When connected with\r\nbile, he directs first vomiting by drinking tepid water, and then to take\r\npurgatives, and afterwards wormwood. When the disease is protracted, he\r\napproves of opening the temporal vessels, and of using sternutatories.\r\nWhen it arises from a blow, he recommends bleeding, and purging with\r\ncolocynth, &c. He states that Ruffus recommended the affusion of cold\r\nwater, or of oils congealed in snow, over the head. In obstinate cases,\r\nhe directs the use of the actual cautery.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. V.—ON CEPHALÆA AND HEMICRANIA.\r\n\r\nEach of these affections is a permanent pain of the head, liable to be\r\nincreased by noises, cries, a brilliant light, drinking of wine, and\r\nstrong-smelling things which fill the head. Some feel as if the whole\r\nhead were struck, and some as if one half, in which case the complaint\r\nis called hemicrania. When the affection is seated within the skull, the\r\npain extends to the roots of the eyes, and when externally it spreads\r\naround the skull. Pain then, accompanied with heaviness, indicates\r\nplethora; if with pungency, acrimony of the humours or spirits; if with\r\nthrobbing, inflammation; if with tightness and without heaviness and\r\nthrobbing, a fulness of a thin and flatulent spirit (_gas?_); but if\r\nit be attended with throbbing, it is indicative of inflammation of a\r\nmembrane; if with heaviness, of a fulness contained within the membrane.\r\nIf the putrid humour acquire heat, the headach will be attended with\r\nfever; and, in general, those in whom headach proceeds from inflammation\r\nhave fever. When, therefore, the whole body is in a plethoric state,\r\nwe must bleed (attention being paid to the strength), and use the more\r\nacrid clysters. Should there still appear to be a fulness of blood, we\r\nmust open the veins of the nose, and endeavour to evacuate thereby to a\r\nsufficient amount. We must then give hiera sharpened with vinegar, and\r\nuse masticatories, or medicines for evacuating the phlegm by the mouth;\r\nalso procure evacuations from the nose by means of errhines, such as the\r\njuice of elaterium, which may be poured in with milk; or the elaterium\r\nmay be snuffed up dry, or else the juice of sow-bread or of leeks. The\r\nfollowing are compound medicines:\r\n\r\n_An errhine for chronic headachs, ophthalmy, and epilepsy._ Of gith\r\n(_nigella sativa_), dr. viij; of sal ammoniac, dr. iv; of elaterium, dr.\r\niv; pound and mix with Sicyonian oil, or that of iris, or of privet, so\r\nas to have the thickness of cerate, and apply to the nostrils.\r\n\r\n_An errhine to be snuffed up._ Of dried sow bread, dr. viij.; of red\r\nnitre, dr. iv; or if, instead of the nitre, you will use elaterium, it\r\nwill be still better. Snuff it through a reed. In more chronic cases use\r\nepithemes to the head and unguents, as the following:\r\n\r\n_An epitheme for cephalæa._ Of the ointment of iris, of hog’s fennel and\r\ncastor, of each, dr. j; of bay-berries, dr. ij; of the tops of rue, dr.\r\niv; mix with rose-cerate, and having shaved the head, apply to the whole\r\nof it. A certain woman, by using the following application in cases of\r\nhemicrania, acquired wonderful celebrity: Having cut down the green root\r\nof the wild cucumber into small pieces, she boiled it and wormwood in oil\r\nand water until they were softened; and with the warm oil and water she\r\nfomented moderately the affected part; and, pounding the root and the\r\nwormwood, she made a cataplasm of them. And with this application she\r\ncured cases of hemicrania, both with fever and without. When a strong\r\nparoxysm takes place, so that the pain is insupportable, use paregoric\r\nand alterative applications like the following:\r\n\r\n_An unguent for cephalæa._ Of the juice of hog’s fennel, dr. xvj; of the\r\njuice of poppy, of anise, of henbane, of saffron, of myrrh, of scammony,\r\nof each, dr. ij. Add to vinegar and make trochisks. When using it, anoint\r\nthose who have pain of the head from thick humours or a flatulent spirit\r\nwith it, along with vinegar or oxycrate. We must, likewise, use a dropax\r\nand sinapism, and the trochisk from thapsia. That, too, from writing ink\r\nis much approved of for the same cause, and is to be used, as will be\r\ndescribed in the Book on Compound Medicines.\r\n\r\nThe following one is possessed of wonderful efficacy for hemicrania\r\nproceeding from a thick and viscid humour: Of euphorbium, one part; of\r\ncastor, an equal quantity; mixing with water, insert into the ear of the\r\naffected side, and order the patient to go into a bath, and, when he\r\nhas remained a short time, take it out, and bathe as usual. Thus it is\r\nof tried efficacy. It will not be improper also to add them to oil, and\r\ninject into the ear. The application described for ischiatics is likewise\r\na successful remedy for chronic headach and hemicrania.\r\n\r\n_For chronic hemicrania._ Of garlic, dr. iv; of wax, dr. ij; of old\r\naxunge, dr. ij; of cantharides, dr. ij. Apply this in the evening, and\r\nhaving allowed it to remain all night, break the blister in the morning,\r\nand cure with the plaster called panygrus.—_Another_: Of bay-berries,\r\nstripped of their skins, dr. ij; of the leaves of rue, dr. ij; of\r\nmustard, dr. j; moisten with water, and apply. It is most beneficial to\r\nthose whose complaints arise from cold causes, so that frequently, when\r\napplied before going into the bath, it immediately cures the affection,\r\nand after the bath they become perfectly well.—_Another_: Of Sabine oil,\r\nlb. j; of wax, oz. iij; of euphorbium, oz. j; with this anoint the half\r\nof the forehead, namely, along the temporal muscle. If the cold is not\r\ngreat, pound an equal quantity of galls and crocomagma with wine, and\r\nanoint. In cases from hot fumes or humours, do not use the applications\r\nwith euphorbium.\r\n\r\n_An apophlegmatism, or masticatory, for cephalæa and hemicrania._ Of\r\nmustard pulverized and dissolved in vinegar and honey, oz. xiv; of\r\nstavesacre, dr. iv; of pellitory, dr. iv; having pounded, strained, and\r\nmixed in the sun, gargle with it. When the cephalæa becomes permanent,\r\nowing to a bilious humour or some intemperament, use the remedies\r\nformerly described for headach. If after all this the pain continue,\r\neven after cupping and leeching, and there is reason to suspect that the\r\ndistribution by the arteries is affected, it will not be improper to\r\nopen the arteries behind the ears. In those of a humid intemperament the\r\nnatural baths may be tried with good effect.—_Another, for hemicrania_:\r\nMix euphorbium and earthworms with vinegar, and anoint the affected part,\r\nor the whole forehead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of cephalæa is mostly abridged from\r\nGalen (See. Loc. iii), where the treatment is detailed at considerable\r\nlength. Alexander, Aëtius, Oribasius, and the Arabians follow the views\r\nof Galen; and, as they are similar to our author’s, we need not dwell\r\nupon the exposition of them. General and topical bleeding, cooling or\r\nstimulant applications to the head, purgatives, masticatories, and\r\nerrhines, applied according to circumstances, constitute the sum of\r\ntheir treatment. One rule laid down by Oribasius deserves attention;\r\nwhen the pain is acute, he recommends general bleeding; and, when it is\r\nprotracted, local. When cephalæa is connected with constipation of the\r\nbowels, Alexander advises that they should be opened with laxative food\r\nand gentle purgatives, such as sal ammoniac (a fossil salt procured from\r\nAfrica), scammony, and euphorbium. When it is connected with a loose\r\nstate of the bowels, he recommends such means as will stop it; and when\r\nit is produced by insomnolency he recommends things of a paregoric and\r\nsoporific nature. (i, 11.)\r\n\r\nAretæus, who probably was prior to Galen, delivers an admirable account\r\nboth of the symptoms and treatment of this complaint. He recommends\r\nbleeding at the arm, and by opening the temporal arteries, or those\r\nbehind the ears, or the vessels of the lining membrane of the nostrils,\r\nor cupping the back part of the head; purging with drastic cathartics,\r\nsuch as hellebore; errhines, masticatories, a restricted diet; and,\r\nin obstinate cases, he approves of applying the actual cautery to the\r\ncranium. (De Curat. Morb. Chron. ii.) Most of the ancient authorities\r\nrecommend the cautery in this case. (See the notes on Sect. I of the\r\nSixth Book.) Aretæus allows a small quantity of a light wine on account\r\nof the stomach, which is apt to be affected. (Ibid.)\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus has given a most minute account of the doctrines of\r\nthe Methodists respecting cephalæa. (De Morb. Tar. i, 1.) He enumerates\r\nmany causes of the disease, among which we may mention too much attention\r\npaid to the hair by females. The following is an outline of his practice:\r\nFriction of the extremities, emollient fomentations and soft applications\r\nto the head, such as wool, or bladders half filled with warm oil, are\r\nto be used at the commencement. When the pain is violent, he recommends\r\nvenesection from the arm opposite the side affected. The head is to be\r\nshaven with a razor, and a cataplasm, or a cupping-instrument without\r\nscarificators, or leeches, are to be applied; and these are to be\r\nfollowed by sponging with hot water. If the belly be constipated, we\r\nare to give clysters of the oil of rue with honey, or the like. In the\r\ndecline of the complaint, emollient plasters (malagmata) are to be\r\napplied. Gentle gestation before food is particularly recommended, and\r\nwalking afterwards. Exposure to heat, indigestion, strong drink, hot\r\nbaths, violent passions, constipation of the belly, and so forth, are\r\nto be avoided. His directions respecting diet are extremely minute, but\r\njudicious. With regard to topical applications, he recommends after\r\nthe head is shaven mild ones at first, and afterwards rubefacients and\r\nstimulants, and cupping with much heat. Masticatories and gargles are\r\nmentioned. He recommends affusion of water, at first hot and afterwards\r\ncold. When the disease does not yield to these remedies, he directs a\r\ncourse of hellebore. The methodist oppugns freely the practice of the\r\nother sects. Refrigerant applications, containing vinegar, rose-oil, and\r\nthe like, he says, are very prejudicial; purgatives injure the stomach;\r\ncauteries excite a dangerous disturbance; the cold bath produces rigidity\r\nof the nerves; and hot masticatories do not answer well.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus mentions a black torpedo applied alive to the head as a\r\nremedy for headach. (De Comp. Med. c. 1.) The same prescription occurs in\r\nthe collection of Marcellus Empiricus. See further Galen (de Simpl. Med.\r\nfacult. in voce ναρκὴ) and Aëtius (ii, 185.) Is not this an application\r\nof the principle of galvanism in medicine?\r\n\r\nRhases insists, with becoming earnestness, on the propriety of\r\nadministering purgatives, especially cholagogues, in cephalæa. His\r\ncommentator Leonardus Jacchinus blames modern physicians for having\r\nsubstituted weak and ineffectual cathartics for the powerful medicines of\r\nthis class used by the ancients.\r\n\r\nGalen states correctly that cephalæa often arises from disease of the\r\npericranium. (De Loc. Affect. l. c.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VI.—ON PHRENITIS.\r\n\r\nPhrenitis is an inflammation of the membranes, the brain also being\r\nsometimes inflamed along with them, and sometimes a preternatural heat\r\nfixes originally in the brain itself. The cause of this disorder is\r\neither a fulness of blood, or of a yellow bilious humour; and sometimes\r\nthe yellow bile, being excessively heated and converted into the black,\r\nbecomes the cause of the worst species of phrenitis. And sometimes\r\nthe affection arises from the brain’s sympathizing with the diaphragm\r\nby means of the nerves distributed upon it. But the aberration of\r\nintellect which occurs at the acme of very hot fevers, and that which\r\nis occasioned by sympathy with the stomach, is not called frenzy but\r\ndelirium. Cases of true phrenitis are, for the most part, attended with\r\nwatchfulness, but sometimes with disturbed sleep, so that the patients\r\nstart, leap up, and cry out furiously; when the complaint is occasioned\r\nby a sanguineous humour, with laughter; but when by yellow bile, with\r\nferocity; and when by a black, with unrestrainable madness. They forget\r\nwhat is said and done by them, their eyes are bloodshot, and they rub\r\nthem; they are sometimes squalid, sometimes filled with tears, or loaded\r\nwith rheums. The tongue is rough, there is a trickling of blood from\r\nthe nose, they pick at flocks of wool and gather bits of straw, and\r\nhave acute fever during the whole continuance of the disorder. When a\r\nfever of a bad character is seated deeply, they have the pulse small and\r\nindistinct, with a certain degree of hardness. The respiration is large\r\nand rare when the brain is primarily affected. And, if the phrenitis be\r\noccasioned by sympathy with the diaphragm, the respiration is irregular,\r\nthe hypochondria are retracted and have considerable heat; but, when\r\nit arises from sympathy with the brain itself, the parts about the\r\nface are hot and suffused with blood, and the veins are full. When a\r\npituitous humour is mixed with the bilious, as the cause of the disease\r\nis compound, so also is its appellation; for it is called coma vigil.\r\nWhen a bilious humour prevails, persons so affected are troubled with\r\nwatchfulness; and, when a pituitous is the cause, they lie in a state of\r\ncoma. The elder writers before Galen called this disease catochus, but\r\nsince then it has been called catoche and catalepsy.\r\n\r\n_The cure of phrenitis._ If the strength admit of bloodletting, we\r\nare to abstract blood from the arm immediately and freely; but, if\r\nthe patient be delirious and will not present his arm, or if there be\r\napprehension of hemorrhage after the bleeding from the patient tearing\r\nhis arm during the agitation of his delirium, we must open the straight\r\nvein in the forehead, and take away at once a sufficient quantity of\r\nblood. We are to use clysters and injections of oil, or rose-oil with\r\nthe juice of ptisan. When watchfulness prevails, we anoint the head\r\nwith rose-oil, or with vinegar and rose-oil; in some cases fomenting it\r\nwith hot water; and we must give the medicine from the heads of poppy,\r\nunless prevented by the weakness of the patient’s powers; and must have\r\nrecourse to the other remedies for insomnolency formerly mentioned. Let\r\nthe patient be laid in a place which is in a moderate state as to light\r\nand temperature, and let there be no paintings in it, for these are apt\r\nto excite emotions in such cases. Let some of his most beloved friends\r\ncome in and converse with him in a suitable manner, sometimes gently\r\nsoothing him, and at other times chiding him more harshly. His food at\r\nfirst should consist of honied water, and afterwards of the juice of\r\nptisan, or spoon-meats formed from chondrus, with some sweet potion, such\r\nas apomel, or hydrorosatum, or rhodomel, or the sweet hydromel. But the\r\nvinous hydromel which is brought from Cebyra in small vessels must be\r\nrejected, as it produces more mischief than wine itself, especially in\r\naffections of the head and before concoction. We are also to administer\r\nbread that has been soaked in water, and succory, and boiled lettuces.\r\nOr, if there be much effervescence, they may be given raw, and also the\r\nmedullary part of the cucumber, of the pompion, of apricots, and the\r\nlike. They must be kept from cold water, more especially if the affection\r\nbe found to proceed from sympathy with the diaphragm. If their urine\r\n(as is likely) be retained, owing to their delirium, we must foment the\r\nlower part of the belly and bladder with warm oil and water, and then, by\r\napplying the fingers of the hand to the part, we must try to incite them\r\nto make water. We must also anoint the rest of the body with warm oil;\r\nand the patients are to be kept in a recumbent posture, for a state of\r\nquietude is to be maintained as much as possible; and, if they be rich,\r\nthey are to be restrained by their servants; but, if not, they are to be\r\nbound with ligatures. For irregular motion is apt to produce prostration\r\nof the strength. And for another reason, too, the feet ought to be bound\r\nwith ligatures after having been bathed, and friction applied to them,\r\nnamely, for the sake of revulsion. But, if the attack be more protracted\r\nand difficult to remove, we must abstain from all narcotics; and to\r\nthe fomentations of the head are to be added things of a discutient\r\nnature, such as the juice of mint, or of wild thyme, or of calamint,\r\nor of rue; and then we must use errhines. After the seventh day, if the\r\nviscera be inflamed, we are to soothe them by cataplasms of linseed and\r\nraw barley-flour in oil and water. We are then to apply dry cupping or\r\ncupping with scarifications to the parts, and to the back part of the\r\nhead and the spine. But, if the body be observed to be very squalid\r\nand hot, even if the fever remain, we must use baths of fresh water,\r\nand plentiful anointing, and give some thin and weak wine, in order to\r\nrouse the strength; we need not apprehend any mental alienation that\r\nwill thereby be produced; for, either it will not take place at all, as\r\nthe disease is on the decline, or, if it do, it may be easily removed.\r\nWhen the disease further abates, we must have recourse to gestation and\r\nsuitable restoratives. Recovery may be promoted by avoiding intoxication,\r\nanger, indigestion of the food, and more especially exposure to the heat\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates treats cursorily of phrenitis in several of his\r\nworks, particularly ‘de Morb.’ (iii, 9,) and ‘Epid.’ See Galen (Meth.\r\nMed. xiii, de Loc. Affec. v, 4); Aretæus (de Morb. Acut. i, 1); Alexander\r\n(i, 13); Aëtius (vi, 2); Actuarius (Meth. Med. iv, 2); Nonnus (c. 25);\r\nPseudo-Dioscorides (Euporist. i, 13); Cælius Aurelianus (Morb. Acut. i,\r\n1, &c.); Celsus (iii, 18); Serenus Samonicus; Octavius Horatianus (ii,\r\n2); Serapion (i, 20); Mesue (de Ægr. Capit. c. 19); Avenzoar (i, 4, c.\r\n6); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix, 4, and Pract. v, 13); Alsaharavius (Pract. i,\r\n2, c. 8); Rhases (ad Mansor. ix, 3, and Contin. i, 28.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates, in his ‘Epidemics,’ details several cases of phrenitis,\r\nwhich would appear to be remittent fevers, complicated with determination\r\nto the brain, rather than inflammation of the brain.\r\n\r\nGalen gives a very circumstantial detail of the symptoms, which is\r\nwell worth consulting. (Loc. Affec. l. c.) Our author’s description is\r\nvery complete, considering its brevity. He closely follows Alexander,\r\nwho agrees with him in recommending the most questionable part of our\r\nauthor’s treatment; we mean the administration of wine. Of course,\r\nhowever, it must have been a weak light wine. He insists that when the\r\nstrength is much reduced, it does more good than harm, by improving the\r\npowers of the constitution. Cælius, however, says that wine is nothing\r\nless than a poison. Alexander, Aretæus, and Aëtius agree that cold drink\r\nshould be given with caution. Most of the authorities have correctly\r\ndescribed the pulse as being small and dense. Our author’s practice, in\r\nregard to bleeding from the temporal vein, is derived from Alexander,\r\nwho gives a very interesting case, in which he applied it with great\r\nsuccess. He recommends great caution in the administration of narcotics.\r\nUpon the whole he is favorable to the tepid bath, as serving to procure\r\nsleep, but he condemns the hot. Among the minutiæ of practice, we may\r\nmention that Aretæus and Celsus, like our author, recommend all pictures\r\nand such like gaudy objects to be removed from the apartment of the sick.\r\nCelsus directs us, in pointed terms, after bleeding and purging, to get\r\nthe head shaved, and fomented with a decoction of emollient herbs. To\r\nprocure sleep, he recommends us to give draughts containing poppies and\r\nhyoscyamus; or to apply the apples of the mandragora below the pillow of\r\nthe patient; or, to rub his forehead with amomum, or with the tears of\r\nmulberry. He informs us, however, that Asclepiades condemns soporifics,\r\nas inducing lethargy. For the sake of procuring sleep he recommends\r\ngestation performed at night, and of swinging the patient in a suspended\r\ncouch. For the same purpose, the Pseudo-Dioscorides recommends us to\r\nintroduce the juice of poppies or mandragora upon wool into the rectum.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus gives an admirable account of the symptoms and\r\ntreatment of this disease; and his views are, in this case, not very\r\ndifferent from those of Hippocrates and Galen. He informs us that\r\nAsclepiades condemned venesection, which, he said was nothing less than\r\nmurder; that he disapproved of keeping the patients in a dark place;\r\nand that he allowed them plenty of strong wine. Both Cælius and Celsus\r\nproperly animadvert upon his treatment. Cælius also blames Diocles for\r\nadmitting of venesection after the seventh day, and for approving of too\r\nacrid clysters. He finds fault with Themison for allowing too much food\r\nand wine at the commencement, and for using the bath indiscriminately.\r\nHe condemns the practice of Heraclides, because he applied the treatment\r\nof the Empirics injudiciously, and admitted of bleeding from the frontal\r\nvein, which, Cælius says, is most prejudicial.\r\n\r\nThe treatment recommended by Octavius Horatianus is little different from\r\nthat of the others.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians call the disease _karabitus_. The symptoms, according to\r\nHaly, are heat not much increased, but the head warmer than the rest of\r\nthe body; alienation of the mind; watchfulness, but sometimes somnolency,\r\nfrom which state the patient wakes with starting; blackness of the\r\ntongue; picking at the bed-clothes; pulse in all cases weak, small, and\r\nhard. He is very minute on the treatment, recommending bleeding from the\r\ncephalic vein _ad deliquium_; cupping; gentle laxatives, such as prunes\r\nand tamarinds; vessels filled with cold water or snow applied to the\r\nhead; in certain cases sinapisms to the feet; and, when watchfulness is\r\nprotracted, applications to the head, containing poppies, mandragora,\r\nlettuce, &c. Alsaharavius particularly mentions general bleeding,\r\nbleeding from the temporal vein or the angular vein of the nose, pouring\r\ndecoctions of refrigerant herbs over the head, and, when the insomnolency\r\nis obstinate, washing the temples with infusions of hyoscyamus, poppies,\r\nlettuce, &c. Avenzoar speaks of opening the artery in the head, an\r\noperation mentioned by Galen. Rhases directs us to pour vinegar and\r\nrose-oil from a height upon the head. His general remedies are similar\r\nto those of the others, namely, general and local bleeding, with gentle\r\nlaxatives, such as myrobalans, prunes, and tamarinds. Serapion and\r\nAvicenna direct much the same treatment as our author.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VII.—ON PHLEGMON OF THE BRAIN.\r\n\r\nWhen the brain is inflamed, it is often so swelled that the sutures of\r\nthe skull are separated. The pain is very strong and permanent; there is\r\nmuch anxiety, and much redness of the countenance, with swelling; the\r\neyes protrude, and the head swells. We must let blood from the arm, and\r\nalso detract by the nose, and from the vessels below the tongue. We are\r\nalso to use the fomentations suitable for inflammations of the head, and\r\ncataplasms of a moistening and concocting nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is taken from Aëtius (vi, 25), or Oribasius\r\n(Synops. viii, 11.) See also Avicenna (iii, i, 3, c. 4); Haly Abbas\r\n(Theor. ix, 4, and Pract. v, 14); Alsaharavius (Pract. i, 2, 9.)\r\n\r\nThe Arabians call it _massera_. Phlegmon of the brain, according to\r\nHaly Abbas, is attended with swelling of the brain, so as to occasion\r\na separation at the sutures, redness of the face, acuteness of vision,\r\nand sympathetic affection of the stomach. He recommends bleeding at the\r\narm, cooling laxatives, applications of cold things to the head, and so\r\nforth. The translator of Alsaharavius calls it ‘flegmon’ and ‘apostema in\r\ncerebro;’ says it is occasioned by a collection of corrupted blood in the\r\nvessels of the brain; and directs general bleeding, opening of the nasal\r\nvein, or of the sublingual. Avicenna’s account is nowise different from\r\nour author’s.\r\n\r\nHippocrates makes mention of _sphacelus_ of the brain, which, he says,\r\ngenerally proves fatal in three days. (Aphor. vii, 48.) From the\r\nCommentary of Galen it would appear that by sphacelus he meant that state\r\nwhich is the result of an extreme degree of inflammation. Another of his\r\ncommentators, Theophilus, states that by sphacelus was meant incipient\r\nmortification. (Ed. Dietz, ii, 537.) It was therefore a species of\r\n_ramollissement_. See an elaborate disquisition into the nature of the\r\nsphacelus of Hippocrates by Dr. Coray. (Ad Hippocrat. de Aer. &c. 64.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VIII.—ON ERYSIPELAS OF THE BRAIN.\r\n\r\nErysipelas occurs also in the brain, and the patient suffers in the\r\nfollowing manner: he has pain of the whole head, and feels as if there\r\nwere fire in it; his face is cold and somewhat pale, and his mouth dry.\r\nWherefore, bleed such a patient, and more particularly abstract blood\r\nfrom the veins under the tongue, and apply cooling things, such as we use\r\nin other kinds of erysipelas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Aëtius, Oribasius, Avicenna, Haly Abbas, and Alsaharavius\r\ntreat of this disease in much the same terms as our author. Haly says\r\nthere is less heat of the face than in phlegmon, nay, that the face even\r\nfeels cold. Alsaharavius describes it as being accompanied with violent\r\npain, much inflammation, and blackness of the face. He approves of the\r\ndepletory treatment in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IX.—ON LETHARGY.\r\n\r\nLethargy, which is a lesion of the rational part, has the same seat\r\nas frenzy, I mean the brain, but the matter which causes it is of\r\nan opposite nature; for it is occasioned by a humid and cold phlegm\r\nirrigating the brain. It is attended with an obscure fever, which is\r\nnot very pungent, and with somnolency. The pulse is large, rare, and\r\nundulatory; the respiration is very rare and weak. Lethargies are\r\naltogether disposed to sleep; are roused with difficulty; can scarcely\r\nbe made to answer questions; are forgetful and delirious; they yawn\r\nfrequently, and remain sometimes with their jaws distended, as forgetting\r\nto shut their mouths; their evacuations by the belly are generally\r\nwatery, but sometimes, on the contrary, the belly is dry; their urine\r\nis like that of cattle. Some have tremblings and sweatings. Carus being\r\noccasioned by the same matter as lethargy differs from it in this, that\r\nfever precedes carus and is more violent, whereas it is subsequent in\r\nlethargy; and in this respect also, that carus often supervenes upon\r\nother complaints, for it often follows paroxysms of fevers, epilepsy,\r\nand compression of the brain, as from the bone in fractures, or from the\r\nmeningophylax pressing upon the anterior ventricle of the brain; whereas\r\nlethargy has a certain peculiar formation.\r\n\r\n_The cure of lethargy._ When the strength permits, we must open a vein;\r\nbut, when it does not, we must use acrid clysters. We must also lay the\r\npatient in an apartment of large size, and having a moderate degree of\r\nlight, and apply to the head an embrocation of oil to which castor has\r\nbeen added. Some, instead of the oil, use vinegar and rose-oil with the\r\ncastor, by which they strengthen and warm the head at the same time. And,\r\nhaving anointed the rest of the body, particularly the extremities, with\r\nold oil, they stimulate them with calcined nitre, pellitory, pepper, or\r\nthe granum cnidium. It is also possible, by making them into cerate with\r\ncastor, to use them in this way. We must likewise apply strong-scented\r\nthings, triturating thyme, marjoram, and pennyroyal, with vinegar. We may\r\nsmear the mouth and palate with mustard pounded in a small quantity of\r\nhoney, and we may even remove with the fingers the phlegm which adheres\r\nto it. And, if they will admit it, it is proper to use a masticatory\r\nconsisting of oxymel with hyssop, pennyroyal, marjoram, or mustard\r\nitself. We may give also in their drink things of a diffusible nature,\r\nmore particularly the diospolites, to the amount of a spoonful, with\r\noxycrate. When there is chronic trembling, we must give two or three\r\nscruples of castor; or, if there be a redundance of humours, and there\r\nbe nothing to contra-indicate the use of it, we may add a scruple of\r\nscammony to the castor. When the disease is protracted, the head must\r\nbe shaved and fomented with salt, millet, and the like, in small bags;\r\nand sinapisms are to be applied to the whole head, and medicines used to\r\nexcite sneezing. Afterwards we may apply dry cupping, with much heat,\r\nor cupping with scarifications, to the back part of the head. It will\r\nbe necessary to attend to the natural evacuations by means of clysters\r\nand diuretics. Apply to the lower part of the belly an embrocation with\r\noil of rue, or Sicyonian oil with some castor. We must also attend\r\nparticularly to the deglutition, injecting, by means of a vessel with\r\na narrow mouth, warm water, to which has been added some sweet potion,\r\nmore especially apomel. And, if there be inflammation in the intermediate\r\nparts, we must cure it with embrocations and cataplasms. To the nose is\r\nto be applied mustard triturated with vinegar, or burnt castor. Their\r\nfood should consist of ptisan, or the decoction of oats, or that of\r\nalica, with oxymel, salt, or pennyroyal, sometimes giving of it every\r\nday, and sometimes only every alternate day. After food, ligatures are to\r\nbe applied to the extremities, which may also be bent back; and the limbs\r\nare to be pinched; and sometimes we may even tear the hair violently in\r\norder to rouse them. Rubefacients to the thighs and legs are also proper.\r\nWhen the affection is in the decline, we may enjoin suitable gestation,\r\ndirect the bath to be taken, and a restorative regimen to be used\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Hippocrates (de Morbis, iii, 5); Celsus (iii, 20); Galen\r\n(Meth. Med. xiii); Aretæus (Cur. Morb. Acut. i, 2); Oribasius (Synops.\r\nviii, 1); Aëtius (vi, 3); Alexander (i, 14); Actuarius (Meth. Med. iv,\r\n2); Nonnus (c. 22); Octavius Horatianus (ii, 2); Cælius Aurelianus (de\r\nMorb. Acut. i, 2); Avicenna (iii, i, 3, 7); Serapion (i, 17); Mesne (de\r\nÆgrit. Cap. 22); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix. 5, and Pract. v, 15); Rhases\r\n(Divis. c. 6, Contin. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe ancients, it will be remarked, ascribe the disease to serious\r\ncongestion, which is a very plausible theory. All the other authorities\r\nrecommend nearly the same treatment as our author.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that by lethargus Hippocrates meant a remittent\r\nfever, resembling the causus. The other authorities on this subject also\r\ndescribe the disease as a febrile affection.\r\n\r\nAëtius, as usual, is minute and judicious. He remarks that purging is\r\nnot only useful, by producing evacuation of the bowels, but also by\r\noccasioning revulsion. When the disease comes on after frenzy, he forbids\r\nvenesection, but otherwise approves of it. He and Alexander strongly\r\ncommend castor. Alexander directs venesection, if the patient’s strength\r\npermit; the application of vinegar and rose-oil to the head; and, when\r\nthe disease is on the decline, applications containing castor and other\r\nsuch stimulants. It is to be remarked, by the way, that Haly Abbas states\r\nthis as the mode of treatment directed by Alexander Aphrodisiensis, from\r\nwhich it may be inferred that A. Trallian and A. Aphrodisiensis were the\r\nsame person.\r\n\r\nCelsus speaks favorably of the affusion of cold water.\r\n\r\nAretæus gives the plan of treatment very circumstantially, but his\r\nchapter on the symptoms of lethargy is lost. He lays it down that the\r\ndisease is the counterpart to phrenitis, being occasioned by a cold\r\nhumour oppressing the brain. The principle of his treatment seems to be\r\nto produce revulsion; for which purpose he recommends drastic purgatives\r\nand stimulant applications of all kinds to the skin. He is guarded in\r\nspeaking of bleeding.\r\n\r\nThe methodical treatment recommended by Cælius Aurelianus is not much\r\ndifferent from that of the other sects. He approves of bleeding, of\r\nshaving the head, and applying cupping-instruments to it, or else\r\nleeches; of making the patient lie in a bright light; of using gentle\r\nmeans to rouse him; but he justly condemns Diocles for recommending\r\nmeasures of great severity, which, he says, will but increase the\r\ndisorder of the brain. He also disapproves of the practice of Praxagoras,\r\nwho gave wine and hot stimulants; and further ridicules him for\r\nneglecting the head, and merely applying fomentations to the feet. He\r\ndoes not approve of Asclepiades’ practice of treating the disease with\r\nstrong sternutatories, sinapisms to the head, and analeptics. He finds\r\nfault with Themison for making his patient lie in a dark place. He\r\nalso condemns Themison’s practice of giving aloes by the mouth before\r\nfood, as it will make the food in the stomach spoil, that is to say,\r\nwill interrupt the digestive process, or, in case of its not operating\r\ndownwards, will be absorbed, and increase the constitutional disorder.\r\nHe further disapproves of Themison’s practice of carrying gestation\r\nto an inconsiderate length. He likewise condemns the use of the cold\r\nbath, which had been recommended by Themison. He then gives an account\r\nof the practice enjoined by Heraclides Tarentinus, the empiric, which,\r\nof course, he does not approve of; although, judging of it from modern\r\nviews, we do not think it particularly objectionable. We dare not enter\r\nupon the detail of it, owing to its length.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians generally treat of it by the name of _sirsen frigidum_.\r\nLike the other authorities, Haly Abbas states the causes of the disease\r\nto be a cold and humid intemperament of the brain, or a collection of\r\npituitous humours. As stated above, he quotes the practice of Alexander\r\nwith approbation. He particularly recommends acrid clysters, drastic\r\npurgatives, shaving the head, applying stimulants to it, rubbing the\r\nfeet, and in certain cases sternutatories. Rhases does not mention\r\nvenesection; but Avicenna and most of his countrymen do. Avicenna and\r\nMesue recommend emetics. Their treatment otherwise, like our author’s,\r\nconsists of acrid clysters, friction of the extremities, masticatories,\r\ncalefacient and repellent applications to the head. With regard to the\r\nlast, Mesue may be consulted with advantage. Rhases, in his ‘Continens,’\r\nrecommends bleeding, fetid pills, leeches, cupping, and afterwards\r\nsternutatories, friction of the extremities, and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. X.—ON CATOCHUS, OR COMA VIGIL.\r\n\r\nWe have already, in treating of phrenitis, mentioned the formation of\r\nthis disease, the symptoms whereof in general are the same as those\r\nof phrenitis and lethargy, being modified according to the prevailing\r\nmatter. The peculiar symptoms are these: The patients remain fixedly\r\nstretched in a supine posture, having sometimes their countenance\r\nsomewhat swelled and livid like those in lethargy, and sometimes with\r\na florid redness in it; the upper eyelid seems drawn upwards and\r\nprojecting, so that they cannot wink. They seem also not to breathe,\r\nbut to be as dead. The pulse is small, indistinct, and very dense. The\r\ndischarges from the bowels and bladder are suppressed, or in small\r\nquantities. When the attack is moderate, they drink whatever fluid is\r\npoured into the mouth; but those who are overpowered by it reject the\r\nsame by the nose. Those, therefore, in whom the phlegm prevails over the\r\nbile, we distinguish from those affected with lethargy by this, that\r\nthere is no swelling present, nor is the colour livid like lethargics,\r\nexcept to a very small degree; and that they perspire moderately. The\r\ncases are dangerous in which there is much watchfulness, the urine is\r\nsuppressed, the difficulty of breathing is intense, when they have\r\nsweats, and the drink regurgitates by the nose. If it be a woman that is\r\naffected, the complaint may be distinguished from uterine suffocation\r\nby the circumstance that she lies in a natural state, is sensible when\r\nspoken to, can be roused, but sinks again into a state of sopor. Some\r\nsay that catochus is a different complaint from the coma vigil, for that\r\nit has not a compound, but a simple cause; namely, a cold and dry matter\r\nwhich obstructs the posterior ventricles of the brain, and occasions\r\nthe disease; in which case, the patient being suddenly seized with it,\r\nremains in the same posture as when taken with it, that is to say,\r\nstanding or lying, with his eyes open or shut. The ancients, therefore,\r\ncalled such patients _catochi_, which signifies _detained_, but the\r\nmoderns call the complaint catoche and catalepsy. The cure resembles\r\nthat which is already described, but is to be varied according to the\r\ndifference of the symptoms.\r\n\r\n_The cure of catochus._ Wherefore we must have recourse to venesection,\r\nmore especially when the face is ruddy, or if the strength does not\r\ncontra-indicate, we must use clysters, sometimes stimulant, when phlegm\r\nprevails; and sometimes emollient when bile prevails. In like manner\r\nwe are to apply other remedies, and give food sometimes every day, and\r\nsometimes only every alternate one. The affection is very dangerous when\r\nproduced by an error of the food or drink, in which case the patient is\r\nto be made to vomit without delay, and kept upon a restricted diet; and\r\nthe bowels are to be stimulated, and an embrocation with cumin or rue\r\napplied to the belly. They who have been seized with the complaint from\r\nintoxication, after their surfeit has passed off, must be cured by using\r\na more liquid diet, such as the juice of ptisan. And the head is to be\r\nsmeared with suitable ointments, which, if in summer, may be cold, but\r\ntepid, if in winter. If the surfeit do not pass off, nor the patient\r\nrecover his senses, it will be time to give up the case as hopeless, and\r\npack off.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Most of the authors referred to in the preceding Section may\r\nbe consulted on catochus, or catalepsy. It is called by the Arabians\r\n_subet alsari_. On the characters of the pulse in catochus, see Galen\r\n(de Causis Puls. iv, 16.) Nonnus and other authorities remark that it is\r\naccompanied with fever. Their general treatment consists of venesection;\r\nclysters of the decoctions of rue and cumin, with nitre and honey;\r\nepithemes applied to the belly; and fomentations of water and oil to\r\nthe head. Haly says that the disease arises from a collection of phlegm\r\non the brain; from pressure in cases of fracture of the skull; or from\r\nthe projection of the internal plate of the cranium. His treatment is\r\njudiciously modified according to the nature of the exciting cause. He\r\napproves of sinapisms to the head, friction of the feet, and so forth.\r\nAlsaharavius recommends venesection when the exciting cause is a bilious\r\nhumour, but forbids it when the disease arises from a collection of\r\nphlegm. His treatment is judicious, but not much different from our\r\nauthor’s. (Pract. i, 2, 13.) Rhases’ general remedies are clysters,\r\npurgatives, restricted diet, and, if indicated, bleeding at the arm or\r\nancles.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus describes the disease with his usual accuracy. He says\r\nit occurs in cases of continual, intermittent, and ephemeral fevers. The\r\nsymptoms, as detailed by him, are acute fever, loss of speech, dulness\r\nof the senses, pulse large, strong, and full, and the eyes fixed. With\r\nregard to his treatment, he says nothing of venesection, but approves\r\nof fomentations to the head of sweet tepid oil; and mentions common\r\nclysters, cataplasms to the loins, in order to relieve the retention\r\nof urine; shaving the head, and applying cupping-instruments to it,\r\nscarifications along the occiput, baths, fomentations of oil, &c. He\r\ndisapproves of the practice of Chrysippus and Themison, who recommended\r\nstimulant ointments to the head, shaving the head, and applying sinapisms\r\nto it with sternutatories and acrid clysters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XI.—ON THE LOSS OF MEMORY AND OF REASON; ON CARUS AND FATUITY.\r\n\r\nThe loss of memory sometimes occurs by itself, and sometimes along with\r\nimpairment of the reason, as an impairment of the reason sometimes\r\nhappens first by itself, and is then followed by that of the memory. When\r\nboth suffer, the affection called fatuity is formed. These complaints\r\nhave for a cause the exciting intemperament; but, if it is humid only, it\r\nwill occasion impairment of the memory and reason, torpidity, drowsiness,\r\nlong and deep sleep; but if complicated with coldness, it will produce\r\ncarus and lethargy. In like manner, dryness alone brings on watchfulness,\r\nbut when joined with heat, delirium and frenzy. These intemperaments are\r\nseated sometimes in the fluids, sometimes in the cavities of the brain,\r\nor in its vessels; or in the chyle diffused over the system, or in the\r\nsubstance of the brain; or else the temporal muscles may be affected. If\r\nthe humours are mixed together, they will produce this affection. Whether\r\nthe exciting intemperament be simple or compound may be learned from\r\nthe appearance of the excretions. That the loss of memory and of reason\r\nsprings from cold we readily ascertain; but whether it be accompanied\r\nwith humidity or dryness, we judge of from the discharges, the habit and\r\ntemperament of the patient, his mode of life, the season, and the country.\r\n\r\n_The cure._ If the intemperament be cold, we must warm, but if\r\naccompanied with humidity, we must also dry; but if with dryness, we\r\nmust, at the same time, moisten and warm. In like manner, when the\r\nintemperament is warm, we must cool; but if dryness also prevail, we\r\nmust likewise moisten; or if humidity, we must both cool and dry. Where\r\nwe find a sanguineous humour prevailing, we must bleed or use acrid\r\nclysters, then give hiera, and use masticatories; anoint the head, by\r\nmixing with oil things of a cooling and desiccative nature, we mean\r\nroses, myrtles, lentisk, and the like; and we must attend to the general\r\nsystem. But, if it proceed from an over-heat and fatigue, we must apply\r\nto the head the embrocation of vinegar and rose-oil; and otherwise use a\r\ncooling and moistening regimen in all respects, and with regard to food\r\nand drink. If carus supervene upon fatuity or oblivion, it also is to be\r\nattended to as formerly mentioned under the head of lethargy, where we\r\nalso stated the discrimination between these complaints.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See most of the authors on lethargy and catalepsy.\r\n\r\nNonnus says that carus resembles apoplexy, only that in the latter\r\ndisease the posterior ventricle of the brain is more especially loaded\r\nwith serum, whereas in carus the anterior is affected. It differs also,\r\nhe says, from lethargy, in this respect, that fever precedes carus, but\r\nis subsequent to an attack of lethargy. Carus, he adds, is occasioned by\r\na blow, pain of the head, and fracture of the bone compressing the brain.\r\nAlexander also says that, in carus, the anterior part of the brain is\r\nmost affected; and hence the sensorial powers are much impaired. It is\r\noccasioned, he says, by violent pains which dissipate the vital spirits.\r\nOn the cure of loss of memory, see Galen (de Loc. Affect. iii, 5.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna has treated at great length of the subjects of this Section.\r\nAmong other things he recommends the celebrated theriac, which contained\r\na very diffusible stimulant oil. His treatment otherwise resembles\r\nour author’s. The same may be said of Haly Abbas. For loss of memory,\r\nAlsaharavius recommends the application of fragrant and stimulant oils to\r\nthe head, along with general treatment.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus and Octavius have not treated of carus by name; but,\r\naccording to Prosper Alpinus, the Methodists entertained similar opinions\r\nof the disease to the other sects. (De Med. Meth. x, 5.)\r\n\r\nProcopius states that carus was a common symptom of the fatal plague\r\nwhich prevailed in the reign of Justinian. (Persic. ii.)\r\n\r\nThe philosophers, as well as the physicians, taught that loss of memory\r\nis often connected with disease of the posterior portion of the brain.\r\nSee, in particular, the Commentary of Philoponus on Aristotle (de Anima,\r\ni.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XII.—ON VERTIGO.\r\n\r\nVertigo is occasioned by a cold and viscid humour seizing upon the brain,\r\nwhence the patients are ready to fall down from a very slight cause, such\r\nas sometimes from looking at any external object which turns round, as a\r\nwheel or top, or when they themselves are whirled round, or when their\r\nhead has been heated, by which means the humours or spirit in it are set\r\nin motion. And sometimes it is occasioned by the anterior cavities of the\r\nbrain being compressed in perforations of the skull for fractures, in\r\nwhich cases there are violent pains. When it is a primary affection of\r\nthe head, it is preceded by strong pain in the part, by drowsiness, and\r\nnoises in the ears; and some have either the sense of smell or of taste\r\nimpaired. But in those cases which arise from sympathy with the orifice\r\nof the stomach, heartburn accompanies and nausea follows.\r\n\r\n_The cure._ Those affected with vertigo are to be roused at the onset, by\r\nusing strong-scented things of a suitable nature, by frictions, and such\r\nlike; and, during the remission, for the recovery of the complaint, they\r\nought first to be bled, and then purged with hiera. And after an interval\r\nwe must use an acrid clyster of centaury, or the decoction of colocynth.\r\nAfter such evacuations, we are to apply to the back part of the head\r\ncupping-instruments with scarifications, and afterwards use masticatories\r\nand sternutatories. When there is heat in the head and noises in the\r\nears, inasmuch as they are occasioned by hot vapours diffused in the\r\narteries, we must have recourse to anteriotomy behind the ears, as will\r\nbe described when treating of surgical matters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Galen (de Loc. Affect. iii, 12); Aretæus (Morb. Chron.\r\nCurat, i, 3); Aëtius (vi, 7); Oribasius (Synops. vi, 5); Actuarius (Meth.\r\nMed. vi, 2); Nonnus (35); Cælius Aurelianus (Morb. Chron. i, 2); Octavius\r\nHoratianus (ii, 2, 3); Serapion (i, 3); Avicenna (iii, 1, 5); Mesue (ii,\r\n13); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix, 5; Pract. v, 20); Alsaharavius (Pract. i, 2,\r\n6, 7); Rhases (Divis. 5; Contin. 1.)\r\n\r\nGalen agrees with Archigenes that vertigo may either be a primary\r\naffection of the brain, or may proceed from sympathy with the mouth of\r\nthe stomach. Archigenes pretended to distinguish between the two cases in\r\nthe manner described by our author, that is to say, when the disease is\r\npreceded by noises in the head, stupor, loss of the sense of smell, or of\r\nany other sense, he concluded that the disease was a primary affection of\r\nthe brain; whereas, if preceded by nausea and heartburn, he believed that\r\nit had its origin in the stomach.\r\n\r\nAretæus details the treatment with great minuteness. He recommends\r\nrestoring any suppressed secretion, bleeding at the arm, cupping, opening\r\nthe frontal or nasal veins, sternutatories, emetics of hellebore and\r\nthe like; cold applications to the head, friction of the extremities,\r\ngestation, walking, restricted diet, the cold bath, but not the hot.\r\nAëtius, in an extract from Posidonius, treats of the disease in much the\r\nsame terms.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus recommends the same treatment as for cephalæa. Octavius\r\napproves particularly of hellebore.\r\n\r\nSerapion directs us to open the arteries behind the ears, which\r\npractice, however, Galen had pronounced to be less useful than some had\r\nrepresented. Mesue makes mention of leeches to the nose, and medicines\r\nfor renewing the menstrual and hemorrhoidal discharges when suppressed.\r\nAvicenna speaks of the actual cautery. (See Book Sixth, Sect. I, of this\r\nWork.) Vertigo, according to Haly Abbas, may arise from a pituitous\r\nor sanguineous plethora of the cerebral vessels, or from compression\r\noccasioned by fracture. He approves of general and local bleeding only\r\nwhen there is a plethora of blood. In other cases he recommends drastic\r\npurgatives, aromatic stimulants, masticatories, and sternutatories.\r\nHis treatment is judiciously modified according to the nature of the\r\nexciting cause. Alsaharavius recommends opening the arteries behind the\r\nears, strong purgatives, clysters, gargles, and hot plasters, containing\r\nmustard, and the like. Aaron, one of Rhases’ authorities, decidedly\r\ninculcates that vertigo may either be connected with disease of the brain\r\nor of the stomach. He principally recommends bleeding and purging, and\r\nalso speaks favorably of cupping the nape of the neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XIII.—ON EPILEPSY.\r\n\r\nEpilepsy, being a convulsion of the whole body with impairment of the\r\nleading energies, has its cause seated sometimes in the brain itself, and\r\nsometimes in its cavities. This is sometimes a pituitous and sometimes\r\na melancholic humour. The disease also sometimes arises from sympathy\r\nwith the orifice of the stomach (as happens in colic affections, as will\r\nbe stated when treating of them); and sometimes it is propagated from\r\nother parts, when a cold aura ascends to the brain, either from the leg\r\nor the fingers of the hand. It has also been seen to proceed from the\r\nuterus in females, at the time they were pregnant, for after delivery it\r\nceased. This disorder attacks mostly the young, more especially infants,\r\nand after them boys and adults; but least of all elderly persons and\r\nthe old. Its precursors are, an involuntary commotion, both of mind and\r\nbody, despondency, oblivion of accustomed things, terrifying visions in\r\ndreams, headach, continued fulness of the head (especially from acute\r\nanger), paleness of countenance, and a distorted motion of the tongue, so\r\nthat some even bite it. When it proceeds from the stomach, palpitation\r\nthereof goes before, with rumbling and aching pain; and when fasting,\r\nor during a delayed meal, they fall into a paroxysm. When the attack\r\ncomes on they suddenly fall down, are convulsed, and sometimes utter\r\ninarticulate cries. The characteristic mark of these cases is foaming\r\nat the mouth, all the other symptoms being common to other diseases. In\r\ncertain instances the urine and fæces are evacuated involuntarily, and\r\nin some the semen also. In some cases, when the disease is very acute,\r\nit proves fatal speedily, by the continuance of the paroxysms, or the\r\nviolence of the attack; but it is most frequently protracted, so that, if\r\nit be not removed by the attainment of manhood, by purging, or pregnancy,\r\nor if it invade after this period of life, it for the most part does not\r\nleave a man until death, unless removed by a suitable cure. The following\r\nsubstances are used to prove epilepsy, namely, the fumes of bitumen, or\r\ngagate-stone, or goats’ horn, or the liver of a buck-goat when eaten, or\r\nthe smell of the roasted liver.\r\n\r\n_The cure._ When the patient is an infant, we need not be particularly\r\nsolicitous about it; for when its age changes to a more bilious and drier\r\nconstitution, and the diet is more prudently regulated, the affection\r\nmost commonly goes off spontaneously. But we must attend to the diet not\r\nonly of the infants, but likewise of their wet-nurses. After boyhood,\r\nthose that fall into the disease ought to have the convulsed and\r\ndistorted parts freely anointed, and ligatures applied to them, when they\r\nare to be stretched out; and then the mouth is to be opened, and one must\r\nintroduce a finger or a feather, smeared with oil of iris, in order to\r\nbring away the phlegm. We must also rouse the senses by strong-smelling\r\nthings, such as hog’s fennel, Cyrenaic juice, bitumen, and the pitch of\r\ncedar. But after the paroxysms, if nothing prevent, we must bleed from\r\nthe arm; and when the paroxysm does not abate, we must apply a sinapism\r\nto the extremities, and a cupping-instrument to the hypochondria. When\r\nafter these things no remission takes place, there can be but little\r\nhope, and yet the physician ought boldly to force castor into the\r\nmouth, and Cyrenaic juice, with honey and vinegar; and the decoction of\r\ncentaury, or of colocynth, must be injected by the anus. Those that are\r\nrecovering from an epileptic attack are to be evacuated after recovery\r\nby purging with hiera. This is the cure of a recent and acute attack of\r\nepilepsy. We will next deliver the treatment of the disease when it is in\r\na chronic state. Wherefore the patients are to be made to persevere for\r\na long time in drinking cold water; and when setting about the cure, it\r\nwill be proper to bleed if nothing prevent; and after an interval of four\r\nor five days to recruit the body, and thus evacuate with a purgative,\r\nmore especially black hellebore, colocynth, or scammony. The hellebore,\r\nwithout its medullary part, is to be pounded and strained, and sprinkled\r\non five or six cyathi of honied water, or it may be taken in boiled honey\r\nwith some pepper. Rejecting the seeds of the colocynth, fill it, still\r\nretaining the medullary part, with must, and allow to remain for a whole\r\nnight; in the morning dilute the must, and give to drink. Or we may use\r\nthe cathartic from white hellebore. It is this: Of cleansed bay berries,\r\ndr. viij; of white pepper, dr. viij; of alypias, dr. viij; of euphorbium,\r\ndr. viij; of white hellebore, dr. viij. Give these things at one dose,\r\nwith the must in the colocynth, and it will evacuate well by vomiting.\r\nAfter proper purgation let them be put into the bath, and on the third\r\nday cup the hypochondria and back with scarifications; and then, stopping\r\nfor a sufficient number of days and recruiting the body, give the hiera\r\nfrom colocynth; and afterwards apply the cupping instrument to the head\r\nand nape of the neck, and the day following a cataplasm consisting\r\nof bread boiled in honied water, and pounded with bitter almonds,\r\nwild thyme, mint, calamint, or rue. This must be done for three days.\r\nAfterwards the head is to be shaven and rubbed with the juice of hog’s\r\nfennel dissolved in vinegar, wherein cow-parsnip has been boiled; then,\r\nafter stopping and recruiting the body, nine oboli of the antidote from\r\ncolocynth are to be given in honied water; and, again, after an interval\r\nof some days, the antidote is to be repeated, and sternutatories used.\r\nAfter five or six days give castor in honied water; then stopping again\r\nadminister a clyster of centaury and colocynth; and afterwards give the\r\nhiera again, and use masticatories and errhines in order, and apply a\r\nsinapism to the head. Acrid food must be seasonably given. Benefit may\r\nbe obtained from oxymel of squills drunk every day, and honey in which\r\nthe squill has been softened, to the amount of a spoonful. The diet\r\nshould be of an incisive and attenuant nature; and therefore capers may\r\nbe frequently taken with pickle. But they ought to abstain from flesh,\r\npulse, and much wine, likewise from frequent venery, baths, mustard, and\r\nfrom drinking immediately after the bath, more especially of undiluted\r\nwine. Let them have recourse to gymnastic exercises and friction, and the\r\nlast part that is rubbed should be the head.\r\n\r\n_On the cure of epilepsy from the stomach._ If the disorder is occasioned\r\nby the stomach’s being primarily affected, the patient must attend to\r\nhis digestion, taking about the third hour some carefully-baked bread\r\nthat has been soaked in some diluted wine, slightly astringent, and of\r\na white colour. Give to such persons the medicine from aloes twice or\r\nthrice every year. “I once knew a boy,” says Galen, “who was never seized\r\nwith epilepsy after he carried a large piece of fresh peony appended\r\nfrom his neck.” Agaric is beneficial to epileptics, also hartwort, the\r\nfruit and root of cow-parsnip, and the round birthwort drunk with water.\r\nScarification of the legs frequently repeated is also of great use.\r\n\r\n_On epilepsy proceeding from some of the members._ When the attack is\r\nthreatened, and they feel a sensation in the part, whether the hand\r\nor foot, a tight ligature ought to be applied above it, and the cure\r\nattempted during the remissions, by applying some caustic substance to\r\nthe part, such as the garden cresses (_lepidium_), preparations from\r\ncantharides, and the like. The Julian oxymel is also of great use to\r\nepileptics, by expelling the offending matter from the part. After those\r\nthings which have been mentioned, the theriac and natural baths have\r\nplace. During their whole life, they must particularly guard against\r\nindigestion, and be careful not to take food before digestion has been\r\nperformed; avoid all incrassating food, too long abstinence from food,\r\nall vehement venereal impulse, much wine, and drinking, after the bath,\r\nmore especially of undiluted wine, as formerly mentioned, and likewise\r\nof old and thick wines. They must avoid, also, all aromatics of an\r\nacrid smell, and such as fill the head; must abstain from looking down\r\nsteadfastly from a high situation, from remaining long in the bath, and\r\nexposing the head to the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY.

Cap. 26);\r\nRhases (Div. 7, alibique.)\r\n\r\nOur author derives his principles of treatment, more especially with\r\nrespect to regimen and diet, from Galen’s directions for the management\r\nof an epileptic boy. Part seems also to be borrowed from Oribasius.\r\n\r\nHippocrates with great good sense rebuts the popular belief of his own\r\ntimes, that the epileptic paroxysm is produced by demoniacal influence.\r\nHe justly remarks, that the inferior animals, such as goats, are subject\r\nto this complaint; and that in them it is found to be occasioned by\r\nwater in the brain. It is almost certain that the _morbus sacer_ of\r\nthe ancients, and the disease under which the demoniacs laboured was\r\nepilepsy. See Athenæus (Deipnos. vii, 33), with the notes of Casaubon and\r\nSchweigh.; also Coray (ad Hippocrat. de Aq. &c. 12.) Leo, in fact, says\r\nexpressly, when treating of epilepsy, that the vulgar call the disease\r\nthe demon and lunacy; and in like manner Aretæus mentions that some refer\r\nthe disease to the moon. See further Galen (Introductio); Dietz (ad\r\nHippocrat. de Morbo Sacro); and Greenhill (Adnot. ad Theophil. v. 30, p.\r\n340.)\r\n\r\nCelsus lays down his rules of treatment with his usual judgment and\r\nelegance. His practice is very similar to our author’s. He recommends\r\nbleeding; purging with black or white hellebore; shaving the head and\r\napplying cupping-instruments to it, and, in desperate cases, even the\r\nactual cautery; also friction of the extremities, and bleeding in the\r\nfoot, along with attention to exercise and diet. The use of hellebore in\r\nepilepsy is mentioned by Pliny, and by Aulus Gellius (Noct. Attic. xvii,\r\n15.)\r\n\r\nThe poet Lucretius gives a very glowing and accurate description of the\r\nsymptoms and causes of epilepsy. (De Rerum Natura, iii, 485.)\r\n\r\nAretæus delivers separately the treatment of an acute attack and of the\r\ndisease when in a chronic state. For the former he recommends the general\r\nremedies (we mean bleeding, clysters, and emetics.) Among the medicines\r\nenumerated by him for the cure of epilepsy, he mentions copper, which,\r\nhe says, when given with cardamon, will act either upwards or downwards.\r\nWe need scarcely say that copper has been strongly eulogised in modern\r\npractice. In the treatment of chronic cases he pays particular attention\r\nto the head, opening the veins and arteries of it, boring the bone down\r\nto the diploe, and applying the actual cautery to it. A more rational and\r\nless dangerous procedure was the application of embrocations containing\r\ncantharides and other such rubefacients to the scalp; in that case he\r\nrecommends milk to be drunk beforehand, to prevent the bladder from being\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nAretæus and most of the authorities mention the gagate stone or jet as\r\na test of epilepsy. The smell of it was said to bring on an attack.\r\nHe exclaims in affecting terms against the abominable means often had\r\nrecourse to for the cure of this disease. And so also Pliny (H. N.\r\nxxviii, 2.)\r\n\r\nAëtius, Oribasius, Actuarius, and Alexander treat the disease upon the\r\nsame principles as our author. Alexander, although otherwise a most\r\njudicious and original writer, expresses great confidence in the use of\r\namulets, for the preparation of which he gives very minute directions.\r\nJasper is particularly commended as an efficacious amulet. One of his\r\namulets is the nail taken from the arm of a malefactor who had been\r\ncrucified! In his general treatment he particularly approves of giving\r\ndrastic purgatives and emetics.\r\n\r\nIsidorus thus defines epilepsy: “Epilepsia vocabulum sumpsit quod mentem\r\napprehendens pariter etiam corpus possideat. Fit autem ex melancholico\r\nhumore quoties exuberaverit, et ad cerebrum adversus fuerit.”\r\n\r\nNo ancient author has treated of epilepsy more accurately than the great\r\nMethodist Cælius; but his account is so long and minute, that it is\r\nimpossible for us to do justice to it in an abridgment. The causes of the\r\ncomplaint which he enumerates are drinking too much wine, indigestion,\r\ncompression of the brain, and frights. He says that the whole nervous\r\nsystem is affected, but especially the part seated in the head. When the\r\npatient is an infant, he properly directs us either to change the nurse,\r\nor to pay particular attention to her diet. Bloodletting he approves of\r\non a first attack, unless the stomach be loaded with crudities; and if\r\nthere be pain in any part of the head, he directs leeches to be applied\r\nto it. He recommends gargles, and rubbing the skin with substances which\r\noccasion an eruption of pustules. He enjoins great caution in the use\r\nof hellebore. He approves of gentle exercise, a light diet, abstinence\r\nfrom wine, change of scene, or a sea-voyage. With respect to the modes\r\nof treatment pursued by the other sects, he greatly disapproves of the\r\napplication of fire and other hot things to the head, and of strong\r\nsinapisms to the other parts of the body. Escharotics applied to the\r\nhead, he says, only increase the disorder; and the use of bull’s blood,\r\nor that of a man recently killed, and other such ridiculous remedies,\r\nhe properly treats with contempt. He disapproves of diuretics, and of\r\nhellebore, scammony, and the like, when administered indiscriminately. He\r\nspeaks unfavorably of chalybeates.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians follow closely the views of their Grecian masters, without\r\nsuggesting any material improvement. Haly Abbas says that epilepsy is a\r\nconvulsion which either comes on periodically, or at no stated times; and\r\nthat it either arises from the brain itself, or from sympathy with the\r\nstomach, or with some other parts of the body. It is occasioned, he says,\r\neither by a gross humour collected in the ventricles of the brain, or\r\nfrom compression produced by fracture. He makes mention of the epileptic\r\naura, and, like our author, states that the disease is distinguished\r\nby foam at the patient’s mouth. He joins Hippocrates in pronouncing\r\nsuch cases as occur before puberty to be not difficult to cure, but\r\nthose which supervene after that age to be most intractable. When the\r\ncomplaint occurs in an infant, he properly directs us to attend both to\r\nthe nurse’s and the infant’s diet. In cases attended with plethora he\r\napproves of general bleeding, cupping the limbs, and opening the saphena.\r\nWhen the disease is protracted he advises to apply cupping-instruments\r\nto the neck, and to give drastic purgatives, such as black hellebore,\r\ncolocynth, &c. When it appears to proceed from the stomach he approves of\r\nemetics. He commends peony applied as an amulet. It is worthy of remark\r\nthat Andreas Laurentius, in the 17th century, speaks confidently of this\r\nremedy. So inveterate is the dominion of superstition and ignorance!\r\nAlsaharavius gives a curious account of epilepsy, but mixed with some\r\nsuperstitious notions. He says he had had ocular proof that epileptics\r\nare possessed with demons; for that he had known many of them who had a\r\nknowledge of things which he was sure they had never learned. Like the\r\nothers, he speaks of amulets; but his general treatment is sufficiently\r\nrational and scientific.\r\n\r\nRhases gives the theories and practice of preceding authors along with\r\nhis own remarks, which, however, contain no very original opinions. One\r\nof his Arabian authorities recommends bleeding at the arm, and also\r\nby cupping and opening the occipital arteries, rubbing the head with\r\nmustard, purging with hiera, sternutatories, &c. The application of\r\nmustard to the head is approved of by most of his authorities.\r\n\r\nLike our author, most of the ancient writers approve of Cyrenaic juice,\r\nor assafœtida, in cases of epilepsy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XIV.—ON MELANCHOLY, MANIA, AND DEMONIACS.\r\n\r\nMelancholy is a disorder of the intellect without fever, occasioned\r\nmostly by a melancholic humour seizing the understanding; sometimes\r\nthe brain being primarily affected, and sometimes it being altered by\r\nsympathy with the rest of the body. And there is a third species called\r\nthe flatulent and hypochondriac, occasioned by inflammation of the parts\r\nin the hypochondria adjoining to the stomach, by which sometimes noxious\r\nvapours or auræ are transmitted to the brain, and sometimes part of\r\nthe substance of the humour. The common symptoms of them all are fear,\r\ndespondency, and misanthropy; and that they fancy themselves to be, some,\r\nbrute animals, and imitate their cries; and others, earthen-vessels,\r\nand are frightened lest they be broken. Some desire death, and others\r\nare afraid of dying; some laugh constantly, and others weep; and\r\nsome believe themselves impelled by higher powers, and foretell what\r\nis to come, as if under divine influence; and these are, therefore,\r\nproperly called demoniacs, or possessed persons. The peculiar symptoms\r\nof melancholy, from sympathy with the general system, are leanness,\r\ndarkness, and shagginess; the whole appearance melancholic, either by\r\nnature, or acquired by anxiety, want of sleep, the administration of\r\nnoxious food, or stoppage of the hemorrhoidal, or menstrual discharge.\r\nMelancholy, from affection of the hypochondria, is indicated by\r\nindigestion, acid eructations, heat and heaviness of them, retraction\r\nof the hypochondria, and sometimes inflammation, especially in the\r\nbeginning; and then, when they increase, melancholic symptoms supervene.\r\nThese are relieved by digestion, or copious discharges, or flatus, or\r\nvomiting, or eructations. When none of these symptoms, or very few of\r\nthem, are present, melancholic symptoms appearing indicate that the brain\r\nis primarily affected, and for the most part from a melancholic humour.\r\nWhen the complaint is occasioned by yellow bile, which, by too much heat,\r\nhas been turned into black, it will bring on the disease called mania,\r\nwhich occasions ungovernable madness, so that those affected with it will\r\ndestroy persons who come near them unguardedly.\r\n\r\n_The cure of melancholy._ Those who are subject to melancholy from a\r\nprimary affection of the brain are to be treated with frequent baths,\r\nand a wholesome and humid diet, together with suitable exhilaration of\r\nmind, without any other remedy, unless when, from its long continuance,\r\nthe offending humour is difficult to evacuate, in which case we must\r\nhave recourse to more powerful and complicated plans of treatment. These\r\ncases are to be purged from the first with dodder of thyme (_epithymus_),\r\nor aloes; for if a small quantity of these be taken every day, it will\r\nbe of the greatest service, and open the bowels gently. After purging,\r\nas we have mentioned, give wormwood, sometimes macerating and boiling\r\nthe herb in water to the amount of two cyathi, and sometimes diluting\r\nthe juice with water, to the amount of half a drachm, and giving it\r\nfrequently. Let them drink of the most acrid vinegar before going to\r\nsleep, and dip, for the most part, their condiments in it before eating\r\nthem. But it will be better if to the vinegar be added squills, poley,\r\nor the slender birthwort. When you meet with an incipient case of the\r\ncomplaint, from sympathy with the general system (as described above),\r\nand the body is firm, you must, by all means, begin with phlebotomy,\r\nand after phlebotomy, when the strength is recruited, purge downwards,\r\nwith the wild cucumber, and the composition from the black hellebore,\r\nand promote the hemorrhoidal and menstrual discharges, if the affection\r\nbe occasioned by retention of them. Diuretic remedies are likewise\r\nproper, as also evacuations by perspiration. But if the complaint arise\r\nfrom disorder of the hypochondria, we must attend to them, and foment\r\nthem with a decoction of rue, dill, wormwood, pennyroyal, the seed of\r\nthe chaste-tree, and of the fruit of the bay-tree; for these soothe the\r\npains and diminish flatulence. They may be boiled in oil and applied;\r\nand the cataplasms of them ought to contain the remedies for flatulence,\r\nnamely, parsley, or anise, or cumin; and it will not be improper to add\r\ncyperus, iris, and frankincense, to the cataplasms. These things are to\r\nbe allowed to remain in general, even during the day, and whether the\r\npatient eat or fast; and, when taken away, apply some other protection,\r\nsuch as a broad piece of wool. Use dry-cupping for flatulence, and\r\ncupping with scarifications for pains and inflammations. While directing\r\nyour attention to the cure, you must not forget mustard, and apply\r\nacrid _smegmata_ and calefacient plasters to the back and belly. In\r\nchronic cases, the most powerful remedy is evacuation, by vomiting with\r\nhellebore. The diet for all melancholics should be wholesome, and\r\nmoderately moistening; abstaining from beef, roe’s flesh, dried lentil,\r\ncabbages, snails, thick and dark-coloured wines, and, in a word, from\r\nwhatever things engender black bile.\r\n\r\n_The cure of mania._ Persons affected with mania are to be treated like\r\nmelancholics; and, in particular, we must apply to the head rose-oil, or\r\nrose-oil with vinegar, and purge with the bitter antidote called hiera,\r\nhaving previously bled them; and we must use leeches to the head. But\r\nnothing is of such service as horse-fennel, either the root or seed\r\ndrunk in water. A drachm of the root of bryony with water may be taken\r\nevery day. If the maniacs will not be persuaded to take the purgative\r\nmedicines, they must be mixed with their food, in a concealed manner,\r\nsuch as with mouthfuls of meat, or dried figs, or dates, or else with\r\ntheir drink. But, above all things, they must be secured in bed, so that\r\nthey may not be able to injure themselves, or those who approach them; or\r\nswung within a wicker-basket in a small couch suspended from on high.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Consult Hippocrates (Aphor.); Galen (Comment. in Aphor.,\r\nde Morb. Vulg.); Celsus (iii, 18); Aretæus (de Morb. Chron. i, 6, and\r\nde Curat. Morb. i, 5); Aëtius (vi, 8); Nonnus (32); Oribasius (Synops.\r\nviii, 17); Alexander (i, 16); Actuarius (de Dig. Morb. ii, 34); Octavius\r\nHoratianus (ii, 2, 5); Mesue (de Ægr. Cap. 34); Serapion (i, 22);\r\nAvicenna (iii, 1, 4); Avenzoar (i, 9, 16); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix, 7;\r\nPract. v, 23); Alsaharavius (Pract. i, 2, 27); Rhases (ad Mansor. ix, 13;\r\nContin. 1).\r\n\r\nHippocrates, in his Aphorisms, points out the lower intestines as the\r\nseat of melancholy, and directs us to cure the complaint by purging.\r\nGalen, in his Commentary, agrees with his principles and practice. Galen\r\nstates correctly that melancholy sometimes changes to epilepsy, and _vice\r\nversa_, that epilepsy is often succeeded by melancholy. (De Loc. Aff.\r\niii, 10.) He gives a curious extract from the works of Diocles, with\r\nremarks upon the same.\r\n\r\nAretæus considers melancholy as an incipient mania. He gives a masterly\r\nsketch of the different modes in which mania makes its attack, and\r\nrelates an interesting case of a joiner, who was perfectly sound while\r\nengaged at his work, but no sooner left the place where he was occupied\r\nthan he became mad. For the cure of melancholy he advises blood to be\r\nabstracted at the commencement, according to the patient’s strength and\r\ncondition. He approves then of giving black hellebore, and of applying\r\ncupping-instruments over the liver, stomach, or to the head, according as\r\nthese may happen to be affected. He recommends then wormwood and aloes.\r\nWhen the menstrual or hemorrhoidal discharges are stopped, they are, if\r\npossible, to be restored; and for this purpose blood may be abstracted\r\nfrom the ancle, or even from the arm. He also approves very much of the\r\nnatural hot baths.\r\n\r\nCelsus, in cases of melancholy and mania, recommends in particular\r\nvomiting and pinging by hellebore; with the black species, if the patient\r\nis affected with grief; but with the white, if with gladness. He also\r\napproves of bleeding.\r\n\r\nAëtius gives an interesting account of the treatment of melancholy,\r\nprincipally extracted from the works of Galen, Ruffus, Posidonius,\r\nArchigenes, and Justus. The remedies which all of them seem to have\r\nreposed most confidence in are drastic purgatives combined with bitters\r\nand carminatives. They approve, however, of general bleeding and cupping,\r\nwhen indicated by the symptoms of the complaint, and the state of the\r\npatient. Nonnus in like manner prescribes bleeding in the forehead,\r\npurging with hiera picra, acrid clysters, and bitters, such as gentian\r\nand stæchas (_lavendula stæchas_.)\r\n\r\nAlexander’s plan of treatment is very circumstantially detailed; but it\r\ndiffers very little from our author’s, except that he recommends Armenian\r\nbole instead of white hellebore. Like Aretæus, he strongly commends the\r\nuse of the hot bath for the cure of melancholy. He speaks highly of a\r\nwell-regulated diet, consisting principally of rock fishes, domestic\r\nfowls, and emollient pot-herbs, such as lettuces, mallows, and the like.\r\nHe forbids cabbages, beef, the flesh of stags and of all other wild\r\nanimals. Instead of hellebore, Serapion and Avicenna particularly praise\r\nthe lapis lazuli. Haly Abbas gives a graphic delineation of the bizarre\r\nfancies, absurd fears, hopes, and vain imaginations of melancholics and\r\nmaniacs. Like the other authorities, he attributes the disease to the\r\nprevalence of black bile. Without doubt, as has been often remarked, the\r\nalvine discharges in such cases are dark-coloured; and this, no doubt,\r\ngave rise to the ancient opinion that the disease originates in black\r\nbile. When the patient is young, and of a hot temperament, Haly abstracts\r\nblood from the arm or temples. He approves particularly of hot drastic\r\npurgatives, such as black hellebore, scammony, agaric, and the like. He\r\nalso gives poppies, lettuces, &c. to compose the patient. He recommends\r\ncholagogues, such as the decoction of wormwood, and the like. But his\r\ntreatment is too minutely and circumstantially detailed to admit of its\r\nbeing done justice to within our narrow limits. The same may be said of\r\nthe account given by Alsaharavius. Rhases in certain cases approves of\r\nvenesection for the cure of melancholy. When connected with dyspepsia, he\r\nrecommends emetics and purgatives, especially black hellebore. He also\r\napproves of the tepid bath.\r\n\r\nWe must now mention the opinions of the Methodists. In cases of\r\nmelancholy Cælius Aurelianus disapproves of aloes and wormwood, as\r\nacting too violently; and also forbids venesection and purging with\r\nhellebore. On the contrary, he recommends astringent articles of food,\r\nand astringent applications containing galls, alum, hypocistis, &c. to\r\nbe laid over the stomach. Of mania he gives a fuller account, replete\r\nwith much valuable matter, that does not readily admit of abridgment. He\r\nenumerates many existing causes of the complaint, such as intoxication,\r\ninordinate passions, indigestion, exposure to the sun, suppression\r\nof the hemorrhoidal and menstrual discharges, and the like. Maniacal\r\npersons, he says, are differently affected, one believing himself a\r\ncock, another a tile, another a god, another an orator, and such like\r\nridiculous fancies. He then inculcates the important fact that the\r\naffection of the mind is always secondary, and not primary, as some\r\nhad supposed. His moral and medical treatment is of the most emollient\r\nkind; and he enjoins retirement and quietude. When the patient’s\r\nstrength will permit, he approves of venesection, the application of\r\ncupping-instruments to the head, and leeches to any other parts of the\r\nbody which may be particularly affected. He commends strongly the bath\r\nof oil and the natural hot baths. He also approves of hellebore. He\r\ncondemns the practice of the other sects in many respects. He does not\r\napprove of abstracting blood from both arms, so as to produce deliquium,\r\nnor of keeping the patient constantly in a dark place, nor of opening the\r\ntemporal artery. He disapproves of applying narcotic fomentations to the\r\nhead. He properly forbids all corporal punishment, although he approves\r\nof contradicting the whims of the maniac, and of reasoning him into a\r\nbetter train of thought.\r\n\r\nIsidorus thus distinguishes epilepsy, melancholy, and mania: “Epilepsia\r\nautem in phantasia fit, melancholia in ratione, mania in memoria.” (Orig.)\r\n\r\nThe use of hellebore in mania and melancholy is often alluded to in the\r\nworks of the Latin Classics. See, in particular, Horace (Sat. ii, 3);\r\nPerseus (Sat. iv, 16.) We are inclined to think that it was the black\r\nhellebore which was given in Anticyra. See Dioscorides (iv, 146.)\r\n\r\nCicero makes some pertinent remarks on the distinction between mania and\r\nmelancholy. (Tusc. Disp. iii, 5.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XV.—ON INCUBUS, OR NIGHTMARE.\r\n\r\nSome say that this disorder is called _ephialtes_ in Greek, from the name\r\nof a man, or from those in it fancying as if one leaped upon them. But\r\nThemison, in the tenth book of his Epistles, calls it _pnigaleon_, from\r\na Greek word signifying suffocation. It attacks persons after a surfeit,\r\nand who are labouring under protracted indigestion. Persons suffering an\r\nattack experience incapability of motion, a torpid sensation in their\r\nsleep, a sense of suffocation, and oppression, as if from one pressing\r\nthem down, with inability to cry out, or they utter inarticulate sounds.\r\nSome imagine often that they even hear the person who is going to press\r\nthem down, that he offers lustful violence to them, but flies when they\r\nattempt to grasp him with their fingers. The evil must be guarded against\r\nat the commencement; for when it continues long, and attacks every night,\r\nit is the forerunner of some serious disease, such as apoplexy, mania, or\r\nepilepsy, when the exciting cause is determined to the head; for such as\r\npersons affected with epilepsy are, during the day, those labouring under\r\nnightmare are in their sleep. We must evacuate the patient’s general\r\nsystem by opening a vein and administering purgatives. Black hellebore\r\nis especially serviceable to such persons when given to the amount of\r\na drachm, if three oboli of scammony, and some of the aromatics, such\r\nas anise, wild carrot, and Macedonian parsley, be mixed with it. The\r\ncomposition called hiera, from wild gourd, is also of great service; it\r\nis the hiera of Ruffus. The diet should be light, and they ought to\r\navoid everything that is flatulent. They are benefited also by the fruit\r\nof peony: fifteen of the black grains of which may be pounded with water\r\nand drunk frequently.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Aëtius (vi, 12); Oribasius (Synops. viii, 2); Actuarius\r\n(i, 16); Cælius Aurelianus (Tard. Pass. i, 3); Psellus (Opus Medicum);\r\nAvicenna (iii, 1, 5, 7); Alsaharavius (Pract. i, 33); Rhases (ad Mansor.\r\nix, 12, Contin. i.)\r\n\r\nThe other ancient authors treat the complaint, like our author, by\r\nevacuants. Bleeding (Rhases recommends this to be done at the ancle),\r\ndrastic purgatives, and friction of the extremities are the common\r\nremedies. Alsaharavius says that, if not cured by bleeding, it is to\r\nbe treated, as epilepsy, with hiera and the like. Even Cælius in this\r\ncase nearly agrees with the others, recommending restricted diet, and,\r\nif the disorder is great, venesection. He also approves of applying\r\ncupping-instruments with scarifications on the side of the throat, and,\r\nwhen the disease is protracted, of emetics, and shaving the head. For the\r\ncure of incubus, Mesue and Rhases recommend bleeding and an attenuant\r\ndiet. Ruffus, as quoted by the latter, recommends vomiting, purging, an\r\nattenuant diet, sternutatories, masticatories, and ointments to the head,\r\ncontaining castor and the like.\r\n\r\nPsellus gives a very graphic description of incubus.

XVI.—ON LYCAON, OR LYCANTHROPIA.\r\n\r\nThose labouring under lycanthropia go out during the night imitating\r\nwolves in all things, and lingering about sepulchres until morning.\r\nYou may recognize such persons by these marks: they are pale, their\r\nvision feeble, their eyes dry, tongue very dry, and the flow of the\r\nsaliva stopped; but they are thirsty, and their legs have incurable\r\nulcerations from frequent falls. Such are the marks of the disease. You\r\nmust know that lycanthropia is a species of melancholy which you may\r\ncure at the time of the attack, by opening a vein and abstracting blood\r\nto fainting, and giving the patient a diet of wholesome food. Let him\r\nuse baths of sweet water, and then milk-whey for three days, and purging\r\nwith the hiera from colocynth twice or thrice. After the purgings, use\r\nthe theriac of vipers, and administer those things mentioned for the\r\ncure of melancholy. When the disease is already formed, use soporific\r\nembrocations, and rub the nostrils with opium when going to rest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Aëtius (vi, 11); Oribasius (Synops. viii, 10); Actuarius\r\n(Meth. Med. i, 16); Anonymus (de Lycanth. ap. Phys. et Med. Min.);\r\nPsellus (Carm. de Re Med. ibid.); Avicenna (iii, i, 5, 22); Haly Abbas\r\n(Theor. ix, 7, Pract. v, 24); Alsaharavius (Pract. i, 2, 28); Rhases\r\n(Divis. 10, Cont. i.)\r\n\r\nAll the other authorities give much the same account of this species\r\nof melancholy as Paulus. If we adopt Dr. Mead’s theory respecting the\r\ndæmoniacs mentioned in Scripture, we may conclude that the man, whose\r\nstate is described in Luke (viii, 27), was affected with this disease.\r\nDr. Mead is farther of opinion that Nebuchadnezzar was seized with\r\nlycanthropia. The reader will find much curious information on this head\r\nin Burton’s ‘Anatomy of Melancholy,’ from which all Mead’s opinions are\r\nborrowed.\r\n\r\nThe Arabian term is _cutubut_.\r\n\r\nAvicenna recommends the application of the actual cautery to the\r\nsinciput, when the other remedies fail. Haly Abbas describes the disease\r\nby the name of _melancholia canina_. He says the patient delights to\r\nwander among tombs, imitating the cries of dogs; that his colour is\r\npale; his eyes misty (tenebricosi), dry, and hollow; his mouth parched;\r\nand that he has marks on his limbs of injuries which he has sustained\r\nfrom falls. He recommends the same treatment as our author: indeed he\r\nevidently merely translates this section of Paulus. Alsaharavius seems\r\nalso to allude to this disease by the name of _melancholia canina_.\r\nRhases’ account of it is quite similar to our author’s.\r\n\r\nSchneider has given some interesting critical remarks upon this section\r\nof Paulus at the end of his edition of Nicander’s ‘Theriacs.’\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XVII.—ON LOVE-SICK PERSONS.\r\n\r\nIt will not be out of place here to join love to the affections of the\r\nbrain, since it consists of certain cares. For care is a passion of the\r\nsoul occasioned by the reason’s being in a state of laborious emotion.\r\nThe following symptoms attend lovers: Their eyes are hollow, and do not\r\nshed tears, but appear as if overflowing with gladness, their eyelids\r\nmove rapidly; and even, when none of the other parts of the body are\r\naffected, these parts are always so affected in lovers. There is no\r\npulse peculiar to lovers, as some have supposed, but it is the same as\r\nthat of persons labouring under care. When they call to recollection\r\nthe beloved object, either from seeing or hearing, and more especially\r\nif this occur suddenly, then the pulse undergoes a change from the\r\ndisorder of the soul, and, therefore, it does not preserve its natural\r\nequability or order. Such persons, therefore, being desponding and\r\nsleepless, some physicians, mistaking their affection, have wasted them\r\nby prohibiting baths, and enjoining quietude, and a spare diet; but\r\nwiser ones, recognizing the lover, direct his attention to baths, the\r\ndrinking of wine, gestation, spectacles, and amusing stories. Some must\r\nalso be attacked with fear; for, while they think of nothing but love,\r\nthe affection is difficult to remove. Wherefore, they ought also to be\r\nroused to emulation with regard to the objects of their peculiar interest\r\nin life; and, upon the whole, their understanding should be diverted to\r\nother concerns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Oribasius (Synops. viii, 9); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix, 7,\r\nPract. v, 25); Avicenna (iii, i, 5, 23); Alsaharavius (Pract. i, 2, 17);\r\nRhases (Divis. 11.)\r\n\r\nAlthough Theocritus had declared that neither ointment nor powder is of\r\nany efficacy for the cure of love, several of the ancient writers on\r\nmedicine have given directions for the treatment of desponding lovers.\r\n\r\nRhases, with unusual brevity, merely recommends, in general terms,\r\nrepeated enjoyment, fasting, walking, and frequent intoxication.\r\nAvicenna, Haly Abbas, and Alsaharavius direct nearly the same treatment;\r\nand also mention hunting and sports.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XVIII.—ON APOPLEXY, AND HEMIPLEGIA OR PARALYSIS.\r\n\r\nWhen the common origin of the nerves is affected, and from it all\r\nthe other parts of the body have lost their motion and sensibility,\r\nthe affection is called apoplexy, by which the leading energies are\r\nimpaired; but if the obstruction is in either side, it is called\r\nhemiplegia and paralysis; and if the injury is seated in any one part, it\r\nis called an affection of that part, and hence Hippocrates says, “His leg\r\nwas seized with apoplexy.”\r\n\r\nWherefore, in apoplectics, the respiration remains small. When, then,\r\nit is greatly perverted from its natural energy, it will induce a\r\nstrong affection, and when but little, a weak one. Respiration is of\r\nthe worst kind when it intermits, or is performed with great exertion.\r\nThe affection arises suddenly from a cold phlegm obstructing the most\r\nimportant cavities of the brain. Whenever the whole origin of the spinal\r\nmarrow is affected, all the parts below the face become paralysed, whilst\r\nit remains unaffected, because the parts there derive sensibility and\r\nmotion from the brain; but, if one half only be affected, then is there\r\na paraplegia of these parts, that is to say, a partial paralysis. If\r\nthe sense of smell is affected, this arises from the anterior cavities\r\nof the brain having contracted the intemperament, or from the pores\r\nof the ethmoid bones being obstructed. Wherefore, apoplectics lie\r\nspeechless, motionless, and insensible, without fever. The precursors of\r\nthis affection are sudden and acute pain of the head, distension of the\r\njugular veins, vertigo, flashes, as it were, of light in the eyes, an\r\ninordinate coldness of the extremities, palpitation and difficult motion\r\nof the whole body, and grinding of the teeth in sleep. Their urine is in\r\nsmall quantity, of a verdigris-green or a black colour, and containing a\r\nbranny sediment. The affection occurs in old age to those of a phlegmatic\r\ntemperament, and who use a diet of this nature. If it occur in youth and\r\nin the season of summer, it indicates a strong exciting cause.\r\n\r\n_The cure of apoplexy, and hemiplegia or paralysis._ Apoplexy is an\r\naffection which is never or but rarely cured, for it threatens instant\r\ndeath; and if it be relieved, it commonly leaves a paralysis of some part\r\nof the body. Wherefore, those persons who admit of being cured should\r\nbe immediately bled, and if there be any remission of the disorder,\r\nthe operation should be repeated on the same or the following day.\r\nThe belly should be opened by a stimulating clyster, made by mixing\r\nsalt water and honey. Then let the whole body be rubbed with plenty of\r\nsulphurated oil, but the head with the oil of chamomile, or of dill in\r\nwhich cow-parsnip or calamint has been boiled. Inject honied water,\r\nand apply strong-scented things, such as opopanax, sagapene, galbanum,\r\nor castor, to the nose. It may be necessary to open the mouth forcibly,\r\nand introduce a finger or feather dipped in oil to remove the matters\r\nsticking there. Anoint the anus with applications for promoting the\r\ndischarge of flatus. Give honied water and oxymel to drink, and use\r\nmasticatories prepared by boiling thyme, or marjoram, in vinegar. When\r\nthere is a remission of the complaint, we are to have recourse to\r\ntender, diffusible, and succulent food. When loss of speech continues,\r\nif the strength permit, we are to apply to the back part of the head a\r\ncupping-instrument with scarificators, and, if admissible, it should be\r\napplied to the hypochondria also. Let them afterwards be carried about\r\nin a chair, or couch, or suspended bed, and have recourse frequently to\r\nsternutatories and masticatories. After the fourteenth day, we may bring\r\nthem back to the other kinds of gestation, attend to their speech, give\r\nold apomel with pieces of bread or alica, and afterwards a small quantity\r\nof hiera. After the twenty-first day, we may lead them to the bath,\r\ngive them old wine to drink; and otherwise we must promote recovery by\r\nsprinkling them with warm water, by baths, and rubbing with unguents. If\r\npossible, let them reside in places by the sea-coast.\r\n\r\n_The cure of paresis, or resolution._ If there be paralysis of all or of\r\ncertain members, without injury of the primary energies, we must first\r\nevacuate the offending humour, whatever it be, and then give hiera, and\r\na certain portion of castor, beginning with half a drachm, along with\r\nsome honey and warm water in which it has been dissolved, either alone,\r\nor with the addition of half a scruple of pepper; then, after an interval\r\nof four days, we may give a whole drachm, and afterwards one and a half,\r\nthen two and three. After an interval of the same number of days, we\r\nmay give four drachms, if the patient be able to take so much, adding\r\none spoonful of honey. To the part we may apply some of the discutient\r\nremedies, along with rubefacients, adding to them some castor, or pepper,\r\nor pellitory, or rosemary, or euphorbium; and, in addition to these,\r\nwe may have recourse to embrocations with oil of rue, or Sicyonian or\r\nold oil. The food ought to be farinaceous, taken in a slop, of easy\r\ndigestion, and not excrementitious. Let cupping-instruments be applied to\r\nthe affected parts separately, if there be many of them, but to one if\r\nthere be few. After cupping, apply cataplasms containing pitch, rosin,\r\nor manna. A most suitable application consists of calamint, fleabane,\r\nand nitre boiled along with mugwort, and some water is to be added,\r\nwhich is to be evaporated during the boiling. The belly is to be again\r\nopened by means of aloes, polypody, scammony, or the colocynth pottage.\r\nFatty inunctions are to be made with old oil in which squill has been\r\nkept for forty days in the sun; or, if it be not at hand, you may boil\r\nin oil two ounces of squill, and anoint with it; or the seed of rosemary\r\nmay be prepared in like manner, but an ounce of wax must be added, that\r\nit may not be too liquid. But, if you add of galbanum, of castor, of\r\neuphorbium, of adarce, and of nitre, of each, oz. ss, it will be a more\r\npotent remedy. The herb crowfoot, boiled in the oil, and preserved in the\r\nsun, is also an excellent application. Castor to the amount of a drachm,\r\nand opopanax swallowed to the size of a bean, will make suitable potions.\r\nBut sagapene taken to the size of a tare in honied water, and castor with\r\nopopanax, and the Cyrenaic juice to the size of a millet, are admirable\r\nremedies. The antidote from the three peppers is also beneficial. We\r\nmay likewise use beating restoratives (_acapa_), and masticatories.\r\nAfter the fourteenth day, we may give more copious food; and, when much\r\nbenefit is derived, we may lead to the bath. After the thirtieth, it\r\nwill be necessary to apply a dropax, use the bath, and afterwards put on\r\na cataplasm of mustard, taking care in those cases in which both motion\r\nand sensibility are lost, lest from want of feeling they be allowed\r\nto burn too much. Where sensibility remains, rubefacients only are to\r\nbe used. After it swells, we ought to lead to the bath, and cure with\r\nsimple cerates. They ought to take the emetic after a meal, and that from\r\nradishes. They should be carried about in a chair, or in a car drawn by\r\nthe hand, or in one drawn with a yoke. Otherwise, let them be put into\r\none of the natural baths. A desiccative diet, spare drink, and friction\r\nwill be proper. Let them, therefore, eat dry food, and struggle against\r\nthirst as much as possible.\r\n\r\n_On paralysis with relaxation or distension._ Since paralysed parts are\r\neither contracted or relaxed, and this proceeds either from plethora\r\nor emptiness, it will be necessary to attend to this, and sometimes\r\nabstract blood, and sometimes not. _Again_, to relaxed parts we must mix\r\nastringents with the relaxing remedies, and use intense friction; but\r\nfor the contrary state we must use relaxing remedies only, along with\r\ngentle friction. For the relaxed limbs, let the oil used for friction\r\nhave a little nitre and dried lees of wine pounded on it. Let hot water\r\nalso be strongly poured upon them, especially sea-water, in which have\r\nbeen boiled bay-berries, or the shoots of the chaste-tree, or marjoram,\r\nor the like. If it is in the summer season, let them also swim in the\r\nsea. But rubefacients are particularly applicable to them, and therefore\r\nthe parts may be whipped with rods, or nettle branches; but if the\r\nparalysis remain, the relaxed skin between the joints is to be drawn up,\r\nand transfixed with small and slender burning-irons. To contracted limbs\r\nit is proper to apply constantly a calefacient plaster.\r\n\r\n_On paralysis in particular parts._ Paralysis occasioned by the division\r\nof a nerve is incurable; but when occasioned by an intemperament, or a\r\ncertain humour, it is relieved by the common remedies already mentioned;\r\nbut there are certain particular remedies applicable to each of them,\r\nwhich we shall describe below. Wherefore, in cynic spasms, the jaw is\r\nto be reduced to the opposite side by means of a muzzle. Detraction of\r\nblood from the vessels below the tongue will likewise be proper, as also\r\ncupping-instruments applied along the first vertebra, with masticatories,\r\nand purgatives administered by an instrument inserted into the nose.\r\nIt is necessary to know that the jaw which appears to be distorted is\r\nnot the one which is paralysed, but the opposite one. When the organ of\r\ndeglutition is paralysed, cupping-instruments must be applied to the\r\nchin, and we must use the liniments made of castor, sagapene, and the\r\nParthic juice. Acrid gargles are also beneficial. When the tongue is\r\nparalysed, we must open its veins, apply a cupping-instrument to the\r\nchin, and use masticatories of mustard, and exercise the tongue. When\r\nthe organs of speech are paralysed, apply the remedies to the chest,\r\nenjoin retention of the breath, and have recourse to vociferation. When\r\nthe eyebrows are affected, anointing of the eyelids in like manner is\r\nof great use, and, at last, the operation by suture called anarrhaphé.\r\nWhen the bladder is paralysed, there is either retention of urine or an\r\ninvoluntary discharge of it. The remedies are to be applied to the bottom\r\nof the belly and perinæum, and clysters injected by the anus, consisting\r\nof oil of rue, or Sicyonian oil, with butter and castor, galbanum,\r\nopopanax, or the juice of laserwort. And these things, if injected into\r\nthe bladder by the penis, will be of great service, or prove sufficient\r\nof themselves. Clysters of centaury and colocynth, along with Sicyonian\r\noil, are also beneficial; and diuretics may be drunk with advantage, and\r\ncastor taken in like manner. But, above all things, we must have recourse\r\nto the catheter when the patients cannot make water, and get them to sit\r\nin hot baths of a relaxing nature, and use emollient cataplasms. When the\r\nurine flows involuntarily, we must treat them upon the astringent plan\r\nwith tonic remedies, and make them use dry food and cold drink. During\r\nconvalescence they ought to use rubefacients, and natural baths in a\r\ncold state. Cases occurring from a wound of the spine, from a fall and\r\ndislocation of a vertebra, if there be a concurrence of fatal symptoms,\r\nit is impossible to remedy. If the penis is paralysed, we must apply the\r\nremedies recommended for the bladder to the same parts, and also to the\r\ngroin; and medicines which excite to erections ought also to be used.\r\nMilk, cheese, and the other cakes are improper, likewise lettuces and the\r\nother pot-herbs. When the rectum is paralysed, in which case the fæces\r\nare either discharged involuntarily, or retained, the same remedies must\r\nbe used, and clysters are to be administered, sometimes of an astringent\r\nnature, such as the decoction of cypress, of rush, or of bramble; and\r\nsometimes emollient; such as the fat of swine and geese, and the oil of\r\nmallows; and sometimes stimulating, such as salt water, the decoction of\r\ncolocynth, or the like. Nothing contributes so much to motion as variety\r\nof exercise with the lever. If they complain of a sense of cold, the\r\nrestorative plaster of euphorbium, dissolved in oil, may be used for a\r\nclyster. But, along with the ordinary treatment, the paralysed limbs\r\nshould be bent, rubbed, and stretched in the manner described; for our\r\ngreatest dependence is upon friction.\r\n\r\n_On paralysis supervening upon colic disease._ In our times a colic\r\ncomplaint has prevailed, in which convalescents are seized with complete\r\nloss of motion in their limbs, but the sense of touch remains uninjured,\r\nthere being a critical translation of the disease from the internal\r\nparts. Hence, in many cases, the motion has returned spontaneously in\r\nprocess of time. Those of more difficult cure were remedied by using the\r\nmore simple liniments formerly described. The acopa made of poplar and\r\nof the fir were found to be excellent applications; and many were greatly\r\nbenefited by tonic and moderately cooling applications.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY.

We shall give, however, a brief, though imperfect outline of\r\ntheir opinions.\r\n\r\nHippocrates pronounces a slight attack of apoplexy to be difficult\r\nto cure, and a severe one to be utterly incurable. He says that an\r\napoplectic attack is brought on by turgidity of the veins. When a person\r\nhas suddenly lost his powers Hippocrates directs that he should be\r\nbled. (Aphor.) Apoplexy, he says, occurs most frequently between the\r\nage of forty and sixty. (Ibid.) He says, in allusion to apoplexy (as\r\nhis commentator Theophilus remarks), that when persons in good health\r\nare suddenly seized with pains in the head, with loss of speech, and\r\nstertorous breathing, they die in seven days, unless fever supervene.\r\n(Ibid.)\r\n\r\nGalen states that apoplexy arises from a cold, thick, and viscid humour\r\nobstructing the ventricles of the brain. He remarks that, in severe\r\ncases, all voluntary motion is lost while respiration is performed as in\r\npersons asleep. The reason which he assigns for this is, that the nerves\r\nwhich are distributed upon the respiratory muscles are all derived from\r\nthe brain itself, and these often escape being injured, unless the attack\r\nbe of a particularly serious nature. His account of cases of partial\r\nparalysis is highly interesting. (Loc. Affect. iii, 14.)\r\n\r\nCelsus’ brief account deserves to be given in his own words: “Attonitos\r\nquoque raro videmus, quorum et corpus et mens stupet. Fit interdum\r\nictu fulminis, interdum morbo ἀποπληξιαν hunc Græci appellant. His\r\nsanguis mittendus est: veratro quoque albo, vel alvi ductione utendum.\r\nTum adhibendæ frictiones, et ex mediâ materiâ minimè pingues cibi,\r\nquidam etiam acres; et a vino abstinendum.” Respecting the treatment of\r\nparalysis he delivers the following aphorism: “Si omnia membra vehementer\r\nresoluta sunt, _sanguinis detractio vel occidit vel liberat_: aliud\r\ncurationis genus vix unquam sanitatem restituit, sæpe mortem tantum\r\ndiffert, vitam interdum infestat.” His other remedial measures are such\r\nas our author’s, namely gestation, the application of cupping-instruments\r\nor rubefacients to the affected part, the warm salt-water bath, and a\r\nrestricted diet.\r\n\r\nAccording to Theophrastus, paralysis is occasioned by a deficiency or\r\nloss of the pneuma, i. e. vital heat.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to admire too much the brief but comprehensive account\r\nof apoplexy and paralysis given by Aretæus. He states decidedly, that\r\nthere is sometimes a loss of motion alone, and sometimes of sensibility;\r\nthe reason of which he supposes to be, that the sensatory and motory\r\nnerves are distinct from one another. This is the germ of the theory\r\nfully expanded afterwards by Galen. It appears, indeed, from the\r\nanatomical works of Ruffus, that the famous Erasistratus had attempted a\r\nsimilar classification of the nerves. Galen, however, has the merit of\r\nfully establishing the truth of the theory; and all subsequent writers on\r\nphysiology stated it in nearly the same terms that he does, until ancient\r\nauthority in medicine and its cognate sciences came to be despised.\r\nAretæus states it as a general rule, that when one side of the brain\r\nis affected the opposite side of the body is paralysed; but, when the\r\ndisorder is in the spinal marrow, that the affection of the spine and\r\nthe paralysis are on the same side. This arises, he supposes, from the\r\ndecussation of the cerebral nerves; and this explanation must be admitted\r\neven now to be tolerably correct. The causes of paralysis, as stated by\r\nhim, are falls, blows, cold, _indigestion_, debauchery, intoxication,\r\nand violent emotions of the mind. His treatment is as follows: He\r\ninculcates, in the strongest terms, that the great remedy for apoplexy is\r\nvenesection; and that the only difficulty, in general, is to determine\r\nthe extent to which it is to be carried. He forbids the operation,\r\nhowever, when the senses are oppressed with much cold and torpor.\r\nWhen venesection is contra-indicated the belly is to be evacuated,\r\nin order to relieve congestion there, and to produce revulsion from\r\nthe head. For this purpose acrid clysters are to be given, containing\r\nnitre, euphorbium, colocynth, turpentine-rosin, and the like. He also\r\nrecommends hiera as a purgative; and if nausea be present, he advises us\r\nto encourage vomiting. He praises castor strongly as a remedy for the\r\nnervous affections. The food is to be light and of easy digestion. When\r\nthe disease is protracted, cupping-instruments are to be applied to the\r\nback part of the head. When the parts concerned in deglutition, namely,\r\nthe fauces and œsophagus, are paralysed, food is to be conveyed into the\r\nstomach by a suitable instrument. (By the way, Dr. Friend is mistaken\r\nin stating that Avenzoar is the only ancient author who recommends\r\nthis practice. It will be remarked that our author makes mention of\r\nintroducing food into the stomach by means of an instrument passed by the\r\nnostrils.) When the bladder is affected, he recommends injections, but\r\nforbids the use of the catheter, for fear of occasioning convulsions or\r\ngangrene. He approves greatly of the bath of oil in this case.\r\n\r\nAëtius, Oribasius, Alexander, Actuarius, and Nonnus treat of the disease\r\nin much the same terms as our author. Alexander, in particular, properly\r\nrecommends moderate purging with the hiera and such like medicines. He\r\nrestricts venesection to those cases in which the disease is occasioned\r\nby fulness of blood.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus enumerates nearly the same causes of apoplexy and\r\nparalysis as Aretæus, namely, excessive heat, cold, indigestion,\r\ndebauchery, and injuries of the brain. The season of winter is justly\r\nsaid to predispose to the disease. It is seated, he says, principally in\r\nthe head. His treatment is nearly the same as that of the followers of\r\nHippocrates and Galen, namely, emollient applications to the head and\r\nlimbs, venesection, abstinence, clysters, cupping the back part of the\r\nhead, and the bath of oil. Of paralysis he treats at greater length, and\r\nwith much precision and judgment. He mentions nearly the same causes of\r\nit as of apoplexy; and remarks that it produces loss of sensibility,\r\nor of motion, or of both. He observes, in particular, of the tongue,\r\nthat it may retain the power of deglutition although that of speech be\r\nlost. He details all the phenomena of partial paralysis with surprising\r\naccuracy; and, at the present day, we do not know a work on the subject\r\nthat contains so much information. He distinctly and accurately\r\ndescribes paralysis of the œsophagus and fauces. His treatment is, upon\r\nthe whole, not very different from our author’s; but his directions for\r\nthe application of his remedies are exceedingly minute and judicious.\r\nIn the first place, he approves generally of venesection, calefacient\r\napplications to the extremities, a spare diet, and afterwards of cupping\r\nwith scarifications. When the tongue is affected, hot gargles of mustard\r\nand vinegar are to be given; and, when there is paralysis of the bladder,\r\nthe catheter is to be used. When the disease is obstinate, he approves\r\nof hellebore as an emetic, and of calefacient plasters, depilatories,\r\ncupping with much heat, embrocations of mustard, and such things as will\r\nproduce a papular eruption, namely, flour of salt, nitre, and the like.\r\nHe blames Praxagoras for recommending emetics indiscriminately, and\r\nErasistratus for omitting venesection. He finds fault with Themison for\r\nbeing in too great haste to apply stimulants to the affected parts, and\r\nfor having recourse to cupping before the disease had begun to subside.\r\nThough he permits the occasional use of hellebore, he disapproves of\r\npurgative medicines in general. For paralysis of the œsophagus he\r\nrecommends us to apply a cupping-instrument, leeches, or cataplasms to\r\nthe neck.\r\n\r\nLittle additional information is to be got from the Arabians; and yet\r\nAvicenna, in particular, has treated the subject in a very masterly\r\nmanner. The causes of apoplexy, he says, are either obstruction or\r\nrepletion; and these are produced either by blood or a pituitous humour.\r\nWe need scarcely remark that this accords with the modern division into\r\nsanguineous and serous apoplexy. Even in pituitous apoplexy he admits\r\nof venesection. He approves of vomiting when it can be produced easily.\r\nNeither Serapion nor Avenzoar makes mention of venesection. Serapion\r\ncommences his treatment with an emetic. When connected with plethora,\r\nAlsaharavius recommends general bleeding, opening the temporal veins,\r\ncupping the legs, restricted diet, applications to the head, such as\r\noil of roses and vinegar, and acrid clysters. Haly’s account is minute\r\nand judicious. He attributes the affection to obstruction within the\r\nbrain occasioning a loss or diminution of the powers of sensation or of\r\nvoluntary motion. It is produced, he says, by phlegm mixed with bile\r\nor blood; and sometimes arises from repletion with wine, which case\r\ngenerally proves fatal. He justly remarks, that one of the most common\r\nsymptoms is stertorous breathing. If the face be ruddy or livid, he\r\ndirects us to open the cephalic vein, or vena saphena, and abstract\r\nblood according to the patient’s strength; to apply ligatures to the\r\nextremities, vinegar and rose-oil to the head; and to give clysters.\r\nHe also approves of emetics. When the disease has partly subsided, he\r\napproves of the bath. He treats separately of paralysis, describing\r\nmany varieties of it. In paralysis of the face he recommends stimulant\r\nliniments, ligatures, gargles, and sternutatories. According to Rhases,\r\napoplexy arises from congestion of blood or of viscid phlegm in the\r\nbrain. He remarks correctly, that when attended with stertor it is\r\ndifficult to cure. When the memory is affected, he directs us to apply a\r\nsinapism to the occiput.\r\n\r\nThe paralysis of the extremities after colic, mentioned by our author,\r\nand after him noticed by Avicenna and Haly Abbas, was, no doubt, the same\r\ndisease as the palsy after colica pictonum described by modern authors.\r\nDe Haen has given a masterly description of this disease. (Rat. Med.)\r\n\r\nRhases states decidedly that the skin of paralytics may retain its\r\nsensibility, although the muscular motion be lost. In a word, he\r\nmaintains that the nerves of sensibility and motion may be affected\r\nseparately. He remarks, however, that a part can scarcely retain its\r\npowers of motion when the sensibility is entirely gone. He says that he\r\nhad known several cases of paralysis cured by a natural diarrhœa. His\r\ngeneral remedies are bleeding, purging, and rubefacient applications. He,\r\nand several of the authorities referred to by him, recommend the warm\r\nsalt-water bath for the cure of paralysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XIX.—ON CONVULSIONS, OR SPASMS.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of spasms naturally follows that of paralysis,\r\nbecause both are affections of the nerves; and, for the same reason,\r\nwe shall next treat of tremors. When, therefore, spasms come on at\r\nthe commencement of the complaint, or nearly so, and are protracted,\r\nthey have their origin in plethora; but when they supervene after\r\ncopious sweatings, vomitings, discharges from the bowels, hemorrhages,\r\nwatchfulness, hunger, or much and violent exercise, they proceed from\r\ndepletion. If they suddenly attack a person in health, they must\r\nnecessarily proceed from plethora. But when from ardent fevers the nerves\r\nand whole body are dried, and then spasms come on owing to the dryness,\r\nthis is one of the worst possible cases, and is almost incurable.\r\nWherefore, we must, in the first place, bind gently the limbs which are\r\ncontracted, and resist their inordinate motions, and rub them with oil\r\nof rue, Sicyonian or old oil, or the like; and the patients must take\r\npropomata of honied water. In convulsions from depletion, warm oil,\r\nor oil and water, are to be poured upon the patients, and if nothing\r\ncontra-indicate, they may be put into a bath. We may use a tepid hip-bath\r\nwith oil, and the gentlest friction. For food, they must take spoon-meats\r\nof chondrus and alica; and we may allow them a thin watery wine of easy\r\ndiffusion if they have no fever. Then we must use the juice of ptisan\r\nand promote sleep. Spasms occasioned by plethora or inflammation, we\r\nmay cure by diminishing the fulness, and removing the inflammation by\r\nsuitable remedies. Spasms come on also during the agitations of violent\r\nvomitings, which cases are benefited by drinking infusions of the root\r\nof cotton-thistle, or of the white thorn, or of the Egyptian thorn; but\r\nsome give the juice of the slender centaury to drink when the convulsions\r\narise from plethora; and one should not only drink it, but rub the\r\nskin externally with castor and Sicyonian oil. If they do not cease,\r\ncupping-instruments, with scarifications, should be applied; when the\r\nlegs are affected, along the ischium and the last vertebra; and when the\r\narms are convulsed, to the back, to its first vertebra, and the one above\r\nthe shoulder. When the rest of the body is not affected, but one of the\r\nlips, eyebrows, or tongue, is contracted, the symptom is to be reckoned\r\ndangerous and alarming, although the parts affected be but small in size.\r\nWherefore you must abstract blood from the hind-head, and from over the\r\nfirst vertebræ.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY.

The Arabians adopt his views without the\r\nslightest modification.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XX.—ON TETANUS AND ITS VARIETIES.\r\n\r\nTetanus also, being a spasm, takes place from the muscles of the body,\r\nand more particularly those about the spine, being as it were congealed\r\nby a cold humour, fixing both within and without; and hence they are\r\nincapable of bending themselves. But when the parts of the body are\r\nbent forwards, the affection is called emprosthotonos; when backwards,\r\nopisthotonos; and, when the parts are stretched equally both ways, the\r\naffection is called tetanus. Pelops says that these affections consist of\r\na tension and contraction of the muscles and nerves about the neck, by\r\nwhich stooping, nodding, and turning of the head are performed; that if\r\nthe affection be seated in the posterior muscles of the neck, the disease\r\nis, from this circumstance, called opisthotonos; when in the anterior,\r\nemprosthotonos; and if both are affected, tetanus. The cause, he says, is\r\na flatus, and thick and nebulous air filling the muscles. He says that it\r\nis very cold and congealed, and that this is the cause of the difficulty\r\nof motion; and that, therefore, dry fomentations, and not moist, are most\r\nsuitable to them. And these are the varieties of tetanus. “But,” he adds,\r\n“the cure of all is the same, and does not change with the varieties.\r\nWherefore, the most potent remedy for them all is a fever supervening,\r\nwhen there was none at the commencement.” The symptoms are a moaning\r\nrespiration, pulse rare and small, and sometimes a sardonic laugh comes\r\non; the face is red, and their eyes appear larger than natural; their\r\nurine is either wholly suppressed, or it resembles common water, or is\r\nsomewhat bloody, and contains certain bubbles; the belly is dried up;\r\nthey cannot sleep; and often, from the violence of the spasms, they are\r\nin danger of falling out of their beds; they sometimes have singultus,\r\nand pains in the head, or between the shoulders and loins; and some have\r\ntremors. The disease is occasioned sometimes, though rarely, by fatigue,\r\nby lying upon the ground, lifting of weights, a fall, a wound, a burn,\r\nand a blow, or any other thing which can bring on such an injury of the\r\nnerves. The disease is to be cured like convulsions from depletion.\r\n\r\n_The cure of the varieties of tetanus._ In treating tetanic spasms, we\r\nmust begin with phlebotomy, and wrapping the parts in wool which has\r\nbeen dipped in oil, namely, the Sicyonian and castor with old oil; or a\r\nbroad bladder containing hot oil may be applied to the tendons. Cupping,\r\nwith scarifications, is to be applied; for dry cupping is hurtful. The\r\nneck, both sides of the spine, the muscular parts of the breast, the\r\nhypochondria, and the region of the bladder or kidneys, should be cupped.\r\nWe must not be sparing of the detraction of blood, nor yet take away\r\ntoo much at a time, but at intervals. The sweats should be absorbed by\r\nthe wool dipped in oil, lest the patient happen to catch cold. If the\r\nattack of tetanus continue long, the patient must be put into a hip-bath\r\nof oil twice a day, but not allowed to remain long in it; for, of all\r\napplications, the bath of oil is the most debilitating. Let him drink\r\ntepid hydromel boiled to the one half; and the robust may take a drachm\r\nof opopanax; or, if not so much, three oboli, or at least one obolus,\r\nif we are afraid of its proving injurious to the stomach. We must also\r\ngive gum ammoniac; or the Cyrenaic juice, to the size of a tare, made\r\nup with well-boiled honey, may be swallowed. Two spoonfuls of the root\r\nof laserwort may be given in three cyathi of honied water, or in its\r\ndecoction; or one drachm of myrrh, in honied water, or the decoction of\r\nhyssop. But the least dangerous and most effectual remedy is castor, to\r\nthe extent of two or three spoonfuls, in divided doses. And it will do\r\nno harm, if you give it after a meal; but the drink and the other things\r\nshould be taken slowly and by degrees; for if swallowed with difficulty,\r\nthe drink regurgitates at the nose, the violent agitations of which bring\r\non convulsions. The anus should be smeared with oil of rue, along with\r\nopopanax, and the same things are to be given in a clyster. The affusion\r\nof cold water being, as Hippocrates says, exceedingly hazardous, and,\r\nfor that reason, I suppose, rejected by succeeding authorities, we too\r\nare disposed to condemn.\r\n\r\n_A liniment._ Of nard (valerian), one sextarius; of wax, oz. ij; of\r\nmalabathrum, of amomum, of storax, and of mastich, of each, oz. j;\r\nof castor, of adarce, of euphorbium, of pepper, of each, oz. j; of\r\nspikenard, of opobalsam, of each oz. j.\r\n\r\n_A potion for opisthotonos._ Of the root of panacea, of white pepper,\r\nof costus, of myrrh, of poppy juice, equal parts. Give to the size of\r\nthe vetch called _aracus_ at bedtime. It is also a remedy for orthopnœa.\r\nLet the diet be attenuant, of easy diffusion, and by all means not\r\nexcrementitious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Consult all the works referred to in the preceding Section;\r\nalso, Celsus (iv, iii); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix, 10, 11, Pract. v, 31);\r\nAlexander Aphrodisiensis (Prob. i, 53.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates, Plato, Galen, Horatianus, and Avicenna agree in stating\r\nthat a fever coming on tends to remove the tetanic affection. Cælius\r\nAurelianus seems to question the truth of this ancient aphorism.\r\nAccording to Hippocrates, tetanus generally proves fatal within\r\nfour days, or, if not, recovery takes place. He disapproves of the\r\ncold affusion in cases of traumatic tetanus (Aph. v, 21); Alexander\r\nAphrodisiensis, however, speaks rather favorably of it.\r\n\r\nAëtius, Oribasius, and Nonnus, like our author, recommend bleeding,\r\nemollient fomentations, and the bath of oil. Archigenes (ap. Aëtium)\r\ndirects the bath to be prepared by adding a fifth part of oil to the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe treatment recommended by Celsus is judicious and not unlike our\r\nauthor’s. He expresses himself hesitatingly about venesection, and\r\nforbids the early use of wine. He approves of opening the bowels.\r\n\r\nAretæus says that tetanus is a painful spasm, sometimes proving speedily\r\nfatal, and always difficult to cure. Like the moderns, he mentions\r\nthe three varieties of it, namely, emprosthotonos, opisthotonos, and\r\ntetanus. The disease, according to his account, may arise from a variety\r\nof causes, such as a wound of a muscular or nervous part, abortion, and\r\nexcessive cold. When it arises from the two causes first mentioned, it\r\nis said to be generally fatal. His description of it is given in his\r\nusual graphic manner. He advises the physician not to compromise himself\r\nby meddling with the case when the disease is fairly established. His\r\ntreatment is altogether soothing and relaxant. He recommends us to lay\r\nthe patient upon a soft warm bed, and, from whatever cause the complaint\r\narise, to begin with abstracting blood from the arm. Then soft liquid\r\nfood is to be given, and the whole body wrapped in wool moistened with\r\nsome calefacient oil; or bladders half filled with tepid oil are to be\r\napplied to the parts most affected. He directs us to cup the back part\r\nof the neck, but cautions against exciting irritation by the application\r\nof heat. To the wound he recommends suppurative applications containing\r\nfrankincense, turpentine-rosin, and the like; for he remarks (and the\r\nfact is confirmed by the experience of the late M. Larrey, who recommends\r\na similar mode of practice) that, when tetanus supervenes, the sore\r\nbecomes dry. He praises castor and assafœtida as antispasmodics; and,\r\nif these cannot be swallowed, they are to be given in an injection. He\r\nadvises also hiera to be given in an injection.\r\n\r\n\r\nCæelius Aurelianus enumerates nearly the same causes as Aretæus, and\r\ndescribes all the symptoms of the disease with the greatest precision.\r\nHis treatment also is nearly the same as that of Aretæus, namely,\r\nemollient applications to the neck, venesection, and oily clysters.\r\nHe even enjoins the bath of oil, which has fallen into disuse in\r\nmodern practice, most probably solely on account of the expense with\r\nwhich it would be attended. He also permits sometimes the use of the\r\ncommon bath, but not of cold water. He allows wine in certain cases.\r\nHe condemns Hippocrates for giving both wine and emetics, and having\r\nrecourse to venesection, without due discrimination. He blames him also\r\nfor recommending the affusion of cold water, inasmuch as he himself had\r\npronounced cold to be injurious to the nerves, bones, &c. Galen, however,\r\nremarks, in his Commentary upon this Aphorism of Hippocrates (sect, v,\r\n21), that cold, in this case, is not the direct cause of the benefit\r\nderived from this remedy, but (if we understand him right) that the shock\r\nwhich it imparts to the system proves beneficial, by rousing the vital\r\nheat and energies of the patient. Hippocrates, however, as stated above,\r\nforbade the cold affusion in traumatic tetanus. Our author’s opinion of\r\nthis practice is just such as the profession in general now entertain,\r\nafter it has received another trial upon the recommendation of the late\r\nDr. Currie. (See ‘Medical Reports,’ and Larrey’s ‘Mémoires de Chirurgie’,\r\nt. 1.)\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus recommends bleeding, emollient applications,\r\npurgative clysters, the tepid bath, antispasmodics, and _soporifics_. The\r\nuse of the last-mentioned class of remedies does not appear to have been\r\nsufficiently understood by the ancients; at all events they were less\r\npartial to them in this case than the moderns.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians enjoin nearly the same treatment as the Greeks. Avicenna\r\nand Mesue join the preceding authorities in recommending strongly the\r\nuse of castor and assafœtida as antispasmodics. Avicenna, like all the\r\nothers, praises the bath of oil. Serapion speaks of a bath prepared\r\nwith emollient herbs. Haly Abbas describes minutely the two varieties\r\nas occasioned by repletion and inanition. For the former, he approves\r\nof purging with hot drastic purgatives, of rubbing the part affected\r\nwith hot oils, and of using the warm bath with friction after it. He\r\nalso approves of castor. For the other variety, he praises the affusion\r\nof plain water in which lettuces, barley, &c. have been boiled. He\r\nrecommends the internal use of milk and other demulcents, and the bath of\r\noil, and rubbing the body with oil of violets. The treatment recommended\r\nby Alsaliaravius is very similar. Rhases mentions Hippocrates’ proposal\r\nof the cold affusion; but, like our author, he rather disapproves of it.\r\nHe himself recommends bleeding, when there are symptoms of repletion,\r\nemollient applications to the neck, the bath of oil, the application\r\nof leeches to the part affected, purging with aloes, &c. and the\r\nadministration of antispasmodics, such as castor, assafœtida, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXI.—ON TREMBLINGS.\r\n\r\nTrembling is generally occasioned by a weakness of the nerves (old age\r\nis a proof of this); but there are many particular causes which occasion\r\nit; for it arises from a cold intemperament, from draughts of cold\r\nwater, more especially if taken unseasonably during a fever, also from\r\na redundance of cold and viscid humours, and from the too liberal use\r\nof wine. Those, therefore, who have tremblings from any obvious error\r\nin regimen, must abstain from the things which prove injurious to them.\r\nAnd, again, when the tremor remains during fevers, we must first rub\r\nthe body with Sabine oil; but in the remissions of the attacks with old\r\nor Sicyonian oil. Let the extremities after being anointed, be wrapped\r\nin soft wool, and then let cupping instruments be applied along the\r\nspine, from the first vertebra to the loins; these parts, together with\r\nthe hypochondria, being previously covered over with raw barley-meal.\r\nLet them also be wrapped with wool out of old or Sicyonian oil. But if\r\nthe fever continue, every alternate day let them be put into a hip-bath\r\nof oil, or oil and water, and use soft frictions. But if the affection\r\nbe prolonged, and cold is suspected, they should take a propoma, or\r\nsweet potion, of honied water and castor, and be carried about in warm\r\nplaces; and we ought to give them food of easy distribution, at first\r\nspoon-meats, and afterwards such fowls and fishes as have tender flesh.\r\nWhen the fever is gone, they must be washed, avoiding the cold bath and\r\nwine. But, if there be a fulness of thick and viscid humours, we must\r\nuse remedies of an incisive and attenuant nature. They are these: Of\r\nthe shoots of rue, of cow-parsnip, as much as can be contained in three\r\nfingers; of castor, of nitre, of each two oboli. Give every day one\r\nspoonful with oxymel, for three days while fasting; or of panacea and\r\npepper, five grains; take in a draught of a cyathus of honied water. The\r\nfollowing simple things in proportion relieve tremors: Castor, the brain\r\nof a hare eaten, the decoction of the root of marshmallows, of the leaves\r\nof water plantain, dr. iv, in honied water, hemp agrimony with water.\r\nWhen the cold prevails, we may use the liniment of Zosimus, and the\r\nrestoratives, liniments, and rubefacients described above for paralysis,\r\nalso exercises and frictions. Those who have tremblings from drinking\r\nwine must abstain from wine altogether, until a complete cure take place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Galen (de Tremore, et alibi); Nonnus (40); Cælius\r\nAurelianus (de Morb. Acut. iii, 7); Mesue (de Ægr. Cap. 5); Serapion (i,\r\n3); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix, 11, Pract. v, 32); Alsaharavius (Pract. i, 2,\r\n24); Rhases (ad Mansor. ix, 8.)\r\n\r\nGalen, in the work referred to above, explains the rationale of this\r\naffection with his usual penetration, but at too great length to allow of\r\nour entering upon an exposition of it. The others treat of it similarly\r\nto our author. Thus Haly Abbas mentions various causes of tremors, such\r\nas old age, drinking cold water unseasonably, excessive indulgence in\r\nwine or venery, inanition, and the like. He recommends aloes and castor,\r\nthe hot bath, friction with calefacient oils, and other such remedies.\r\nSerapion gives a sensible account of the nature of the affection, and\r\nrecommends fetid or antispasmodic remedies internally, and friction with\r\ncalefacient oils externally. When it is occasioned by exposure to cold,\r\nRhases recommends the hot bath and insolation. We may mention here that\r\nHippocrates has given a very accurate history of a case of _delirium\r\ntremens_. (Epid. iii, 5.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXII.—ON DISEASES OF THE EYE; AND FIRST OF PAIN, FROM GALEN.\r\n\r\nWhen violent pains in the eyes take place, consider from what diathesis\r\nthe eye happens to be pained in the inflammations; for they are either\r\noccasioned by the pungency of an acrid defluxion, or from the coats being\r\nover filled and stretched, or from the distension of thick humours or of\r\nflatulent spirits. When the pains proceed from pungency, they are to be\r\ncured by evacuating with purgatives, and by injecting into the eye the\r\nwhite of an egg. When the inflammation is concocted, if the body be free\r\nof impurities, the most befitting remedies are baths. Inflammations from\r\nplethora are to be cured by the detraction of blood, purging the belly,\r\nand applying friction to the inferior extremities. Those from distension\r\nare to be cured by first evacuating the whole body, then by occasioning\r\na revulsion downwards of the humours, and afterwards by using topical\r\napplications of a discutient nature. The eyes must be fomented, and the\r\ndecoction of fenugreek poured into them. When the vessels of the eye are\r\ndistended with thick blood, while there is no plethoric diathesis in\r\nthe general system, the patient must drink wine which has the power of\r\nheating, evacuating, and removing obstructions.\r\n\r\n_On disorder of the eye, and particularly of ophthalmy._ Disorder of\r\nthe eye is a wateriness and heat of it, with preternatural redness, not\r\noccasioned by any cause within the body, but by some external one, such\r\nas the sun, smoke, dust, or the wind; wherefore it is soon dispelled when\r\nthe cause is removed. And ophthalmy is a marked disorder, which may be\r\noccasioned not only by an external cause, but also without any obvious\r\none, and remains until the third, fourth, or fifth day. It is best cured\r\nby avoiding every external exciting cause, by spare diet, drinking water,\r\nwalking, and by opening the belly.\r\n\r\n_On inflammation._ When inflammation remains in the eyes after evacuation\r\nof the general system, we may use ointments for dispelling the rheum,\r\nand soothing the irritation, such as the collyrium of Nilus made from\r\nroses, the chiac, or the collyrium from nard. When the tunica adnata\r\nis inflamed, we may use the collyria called monhemera, injecting them\r\ninto the eye with the white of an egg. Next day, if the inflammation\r\nbe not aggravated, we may anoint them with the collyrium of nard, and\r\nuse a fomentation of the decoction of melilot and fenugreek. When the\r\nhumour which occasions the ophthalmy is thick, we may use medicines which\r\nare neither obstruents nor incrassants, but which, on the contrary,\r\nwill dissipate, dilute, and evacuate the humours, such as the chiac\r\ncollyrium. But, if the humours are impacted in the head, we may fix a\r\ncupping instrument to the hind head, or scarify, or apply leeches to\r\nthe forehead, near the eye affected. We must use cataplasms of pure\r\nbread soaked in water, with a little rose-oil, or polenta boiled in the\r\ndecoction of poppy-heads also with rose-oil. We may also use a more\r\nefficacious cataplasm from saffron, melilot, the fleshy parts of dates,\r\nthe tender leaves of coriander, eggs, and roasted wheat and crumbs of\r\nbread dipped in a decoction with a small quantity of rose oil, in a\r\ndecoction of pounded poppy heads. We mix also the seed of the poppy as an\r\nanodyne. If compelled by the severity of the pain, we must add a little\r\nopium; but, unless the pain be very violent, we must abstain from all\r\nnarcotics. If the inflammation be moderate, apply aloes by itself, or rub\r\nit in with water or the white of an egg. In order that the remedy may be\r\nready for use, take of saffron, dr. vj; of aloes, dr. xvj; of gum, dr.\r\nix; mix with rain water, and make a collyrium. And the saffron collyria,\r\nas they are called, are proper for the commencement of ophthalmies. In\r\nthose cases in which there is an œdematous and white swelling about\r\nthe eyebrows and tunica adnata, without injury of the coats, the best\r\napplications are those called liquid collyria, prepared from saffron,\r\ncopperas, and honey. And this one is excellent:\r\n\r\n_A liquid anodyne collyrium._ Of the melanteria used by tanners, of Attic\r\nhoney, of the juice of fenugreek, equal parts. Boil to the thickness\r\nof honey, and touch the two angles of the eye with it, by means of the\r\nrounded extremity of a specillum or probe.\r\n\r\n_For a copious defluxion._ For a flow of humours, in the commencement\r\nabstinence from food is proper, and the drinking of water, and most\r\nespecially abstinence from venery; the belly should be opened, and the\r\nface washed with a watery oxycrate, if the rheum be of a hot nature; but\r\nif otherwise, the forehead and eyebrows may be anointed with copperas\r\nand honey. Some dissolve the copperas in water, and bathe with it. In\r\ndefluxions without inflammation, or with inflammation, but so that\r\nthe affection is seated above the skull, we must use agglutinative\r\napplications to the forehead, either simple ones, such as green vine\r\nleaves, or the juice of the bramble, or of purslain, or of quinces with\r\nsome fine polenta, or with gall levigated in wine, or with fine polenta\r\nor hemlock, or flea-wort with water, or nightshade, or snails with their\r\nshells pulverized, and applied from temple to temple, and, in a word,\r\nwith things of an astringent and cooling nature, or with the following\r\ncompound applications: Wheat flour, and myrrh or frankincense, with the\r\nwhite of an egg, may be rubbed in; or Samian earth, with myrrh and manna,\r\nin like manner, with the white of an egg; but in colder defluxions, of\r\nnative sulphur, of bitumen, of pitch, of colophonian rosin, of each,\r\ndr. ij; also the trochisk of Musa, that called aster, and the like, are\r\nsuitable repellents. And the theriac, dissolved in an astringent wine,\r\nand rubbed on the forehead, stops cold defluxions, and may be drunk with\r\ngreat advantage. Over the eye apply wool, or a small rag wet in the\r\nwhite of an egg; and new-made cheese, in like manner, when applied to\r\nthe eye, restrains acrid defluxions in particular; also the astringent\r\ncollyria, as they are called, when rubbed in or injected into the eye\r\nin a watery state, do the same thing. But if the humour be deep-seated,\r\nand below the skull, and if fixed there for a length of time, after the\r\ngeneral evacuations use errhines and masticatories, shaving the head, and\r\napplying rubefacients to it. But to these must be joined the surgical\r\noperations for the head, namely, Angiology, Arteriotomy, Hypospathismus,\r\nand Periscyphismus, with burning at the vertex down to the bone. But\r\ncupping instruments, with scarifications applied to the hind-head, will\r\nproduce a revulsion of the defluxion. The symptoms of defluxions external\r\nto the skull are distension of the vessels of the forehead and temples,\r\nforming, as it were, a band to the head, and the complaint being remedied\r\nby agglutinative applications of a desiccant nature. When these symptoms\r\nare not present, and the defluxion proves of long duration, and sometimes\r\nis exasperated by sternutatories, the humour is to be supposed seated\r\nbelow the skull.\r\n\r\n_On chemosis._ The disease is called chemosis when both the eyelids are\r\neverted in consequence of a violent inflammation, so that the eyes are\r\nscarcely covered by them, and the white of the eye is elevated above the\r\nblack, is red, and occupies a large portion of the black. We must cure it\r\nby phlebotomy, purging, the white collyrium of roses, and the spodiac,\r\nwith milk, or the white of an egg, and we may anoint the eyelids,\r\ntemples, and forehead with the same, and have recourse to paregoric\r\nfomentations and cataplasms. When the inflammation begins to remit, we\r\nmay rub in the more acrid applications, such as the green one from roses.\r\n\r\n_On hyposphagma and emphysema._ Hyposphagma is a rupture of the veins\r\nof the tunica adnata, occasioned most frequently by a blow. Bathe the\r\neyes with the blood of the wood-pigeon, or of the common pigeon, or the\r\nwarm milk of a woman in which a little frankincense has been triturated,\r\nand inject brine, more particularly that from Cappadocian salts, and\r\nuse a fomentation from the decoction of hyssop. Swellings about the\r\neyes from blows are remedied by repeated fomentations with oxycrate, or\r\na sponge out of oxycrate may be applied to them, or a liniment may be\r\nused, consisting of equal parts of burnt lapis specularis, and pigeon’s\r\ndung, triturated with wine or vinegar. Or a cataplasm may be applied of\r\nnew cheese, or of the rind of radishes, or of dried grapes without the\r\nstones. Each of these is to be mixed with oxycrate or honied water. The\r\nsame remedies apply also to emphysema.\r\n\r\n_On prurient emphysema and psorophthalmia._ Emphysema is an œdematous\r\nswelling of the eyelids; but psorophthalmia is a scabious eruption of\r\nthe eyelids attended with pruritus, arising from a saltish and nitrous\r\nhumour. They are remedied by oxycrate, the decoction of lentils, and a\r\nfomentation of roses. The following is a liquid collyrium: Of copper,\r\ndr. vj; of calcined misy, and myrrh, of each, dr. iij; of saffron, dr.\r\niss; of pepper, dr. j; of Chian wine, and Cretan sweet wine, of each\r\n1½ cyathus; boil to the thickness of honey. This is the collyrium of\r\nErasistratus called panchrestos, which applies to cynanche, ulcers in the\r\nmouth, and on the privy parts, and to the earache. They are to be rubbed\r\nwith oil into the patient’s eyebrows when he is going to sleep. Acid,\r\nsaltish, and acrid things are to be abstained from.\r\n\r\n_On sclerophthalmia and xerophthalmia._ Sclerophthalmia is a hardness of\r\nthe eye with difficulty of motion, pain, and redness, without wateriness.\r\nFor this the eyes are to be fomented frequently with sponges out of hot\r\nwater; and at bedtime the white of an egg with rose-oil, or the fat of\r\ngeese, may be applied to the eyelids. Let them avoid everything of a\r\ncooling and hardening nature; let the head be covered and anointed, and\r\nthe belly kept open. Xerophthalmia is a pruriginous affection of the eyes\r\nwithout rheum. It is to be cured by baths, unguents, and a wholesome\r\ndiet. Applications of an acrid nature are suitable to both, as they\r\npromote a flow of tears, by which the hardness will be softened, and the\r\ndryness rendered more humid. Such are the panchrestos of Erasistratus,\r\nand those called dicenteton and stratioticum.\r\n\r\n_On ectropion, or eversion of the eyelids._ This complaint is an eversion\r\nof the eyelid, occasioned either by a scar or fungous flesh. When it\r\nis occasioned by fungous flesh, and is of long duration, roast scraped\r\nverdigris, pulverise it and apply, or use burned lead washed with sulphur\r\nvivum, or apply both in equal parts, namely, the verdigris and the lead.\r\nEctropion from a cicatrix, if at all remediable, must be cured by a\r\nsurgical operation.\r\n\r\n_On ægilops and anchilops._ Ægilops is an aposteme between the great\r\ncanthus of the eye and the nose, which breaking and being neglected, ends\r\nin a fistula that extends to the bone. Before the aposteme breaks out\r\ninto an ulcer, it is called anchilops. A very good application is horned\r\npoppy and saffron, applied with the juice of perdicias (_pellitory of\r\nthe wall?_) They must be frequently changed, and till then it will not\r\nturn to pus.—_Another_: Alica, boiled in vinegar and properly triturated,\r\nnot only cures the disease at the commencement, but, after suppuration,\r\nit bursts the abscess and penetrates to the bone. By using it, you may\r\ncure not only ægilops but anchilops.—_Another_: Garden rue, levigated and\r\nboiled with protostactos and applied, answers excellently for ægilops,\r\npenetrates to the bone, proving stimulating at first, but afterwards not\r\nso; and, what is wonderful, it does not leave an ugly scar.—_Another_:\r\nPulverize snails with their shells and apply them; and sometimes aloes or\r\nmyrrh may be added before the ægilops is converted to pus; and after the\r\nabscess bursts it dries up the pus.\r\n\r\n_On trachoma._ Trachoma is a roughness of the inner surface of the\r\neyelid, an intense degree of which has the appearance of clefts, and\r\nis called sycosis. When it becomes chronic and callous, it is called\r\ntylosis. We must use collyria for it, namely, the one from wine, and\r\nthat prepared from the two stones; or the eyelid may be rubbed with the\r\nbloodstone itself (hæmatites,) much washed in water. But the collyrium\r\ncalled harmation, with a little of the cycnarius, or the saffron\r\ncollyrium, answer well with these, and with cases of psorophthalmia\r\nwithout ulceration, when rubbed upon the everted eyelid. But if the\r\ncallus be hard and do not yield to these things, we must turn the eyelid\r\nout and rub it down with pumice-stone, or the shell of the cuttle-fish,\r\nor fig-leaves, or by the surgical instrument called blepharoxyston.\r\n\r\n_On chalazion._ Chalazion is a concretion of an indolent humour in the\r\neyelid, for which pound ammoniac with vinegar, and anoint along with\r\ngalbanum. It likewise has a good effect when joined with cerate and\r\nturpentine.\r\n\r\n_On hordeolum, or stye._ Hordeolum is a small oblong aposteme on the\r\ntarsus of the eyelid. We may foment it with white wax; or throwing away\r\nthe head of a fly, we may rub the part with the rest of its body; or wash\r\nwith the decoction of barley.\r\n\r\n_For lice in the eyebrows._ Having first cleared away the pediculi, wash\r\nthe part with tepid sea-water, and use the under-mentioned application\r\nto the tarsus: Of fissile alum, two parts; of stavesacre, one part;\r\ntriturate, and use.\r\n\r\n_On madarosis, or milphosis._ This affection is a falling off of the\r\nhairs of the eyelids. Wherefore, after attending to the general health,\r\nuse the detergent ointments called calliblephara. Of Cannel-coal, of\r\nCeltic saffron, of ladanum, equal parts; pulverize, and use.—_Another_:\r\nOf antimony, calcined and cleaned, dr. j; of lead, burned and cleaned,\r\ndr. iv; of saffron, dr. iv; of Indian nard, dr. iij; pulverize, and\r\nuse.—_Another_: Of the burnt bones of dates, dr. iij; of Celtic nard, dr.\r\nij; pulverize, and use. This also cures scabious eyes.\r\n\r\n_That of Neopolites for milphosis and chronic affections of the eyelids._\r\nOf antimony, of cadmia, of chalcitis, of foreign misy, of each, equal\r\nparts; beat together coarsely, mix with honey; when roasted, triturate,\r\nand use.\r\n\r\n_On ptillosis._ Ptillosis is a callous thickening of the eyelids, of\r\na red colour, and often accompanied with a falling out of the hair.\r\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the following is an excellent\r\napplication: Rub with mice dung burnt, and triturated in honey.\r\n\r\n_For a falling off of the hairs of the eyebrows._ Anointing the\r\nfingers with oil, or geese fat, rub them upon lead, and anoint with\r\nthis.—_Another_, which also darkens the hairs: Triturate blunt Pontic\r\nwalnuts with the fat of goats or of bears.—_Another_, which also applies\r\nto alopecia of the chin: Of henbane, dr. ij; of mice dung, dr. j; of\r\nmaiden-hair, dr. j; of the ointment of iris, four spoonfuls. Pound well\r\ntogether, mix the ointment, and, having first fomented, anoint. If you\r\npreviously shave the part, it will be the more efficacious.\r\n\r\n_For trichiasis of the eyelids._ Having first torn out the hairs which\r\nirritate the eye, anoint the part immediately with the blood of a frog by\r\nitself, or with the ashes of white chameleon, or the blood of bugs; or\r\nthe juice of the fumitory, which grows among barley, mixing it with gum,\r\nor the ashes of pickled limpets with cedar rosin (_gum vernix?_), or the\r\nashes of the lotos; or liquid alum, called _phorimum_; or the blood of a\r\ntick taken from a dog. It is very efficacious.\r\n\r\n_Agglutinative medicines._ The following substances agglutinate the\r\nhairs when bent inwards: Bitumen, mastich, colophonian rosin, glue, the\r\nglutinous part of snails.\r\n\r\n_On encanthis and rhyas._ Encanthis is an excrescence of the natural\r\nflesh at the great canthus, but rhyas is a wasting of it. You may treat\r\nencanthis with the remedies mentioned for ectropion, and similar caustic,\r\nor septic applications; but the whole substance must not be consumed,\r\nlest rhyas be produced, for it must only be reduced to its natural size.\r\nRhyas, when the whole flesh is consumed, either by an awkward surgical\r\noperation or medicines, is incurable. But if part of it only be lost, you\r\nmay restore it by moderately astringent and incarnating applications,\r\nsuch as that from saffron, horned poppy, and aloes; and the saffron\r\ncollyria, and henbane boiled in wine and applied, and a small quantity of\r\nalum with wine.\r\n\r\n_On ulcers._ Of the ulcers in the eyes there is but one genus, but many\r\nparticular species. For that in the cornea, when hollow, narrow, and\r\nclean, is called bothrion. That which is broader than the bothrion, but\r\nless deep, is called cœloma. Argemon is the name given to that which\r\narises on the circle of the iris, but affects the surrounding parts, so\r\nthat the part which is on the external side of the iris is red, but that\r\non the internal white. Epicauma is a foul and impure ulcer with eschars,\r\nwhich, when cleaned away, often give vent to the humours of the eye.\r\nThere are many other varieties of ulcers, all of which we shall treat\r\nof in general terms. If, therefore, the ulcer happen to be attended\r\nwith inflammation, the cure must be accomplished by such things as are\r\ncalculated to soothe and digest the inflammation, regard being had to the\r\npeculiar nature of the ulcer. Such are the collyria, called _libanium_,\r\n_cycnos_, and _palaria_, _aster_, and the like; and those from starch,\r\nSamian earth, and ceruse. But the most sedative collyrium which we are\r\nacquainted with is that of Nilamon; and yet we must not persevere long\r\nwith it, because it is very narcotic. The best of all applications is\r\nthe collyrium from decoctions not possessed of a narcotic quality. But\r\nif the ulcer be attended with a rheum, we must mix some of the collyria\r\nfor it, such as that from the _hydra_, the _chiac_, the yellow _cycnos_,\r\nand such as possess repellent properties without being stimulant. When\r\nthe ulcers are foul, we must use honied water moderately diluted, and\r\nthe decoction of fenugreek, by themselves, and along with the collyria\r\nfor that purpose; when they are acrid, we may use that of Severianus\r\nwith the diachylon from fenugreek; when not acrid, those from myrrh and\r\nnard. When the ulcers are cleaned, they may be cicatrized by means of the\r\ncollyrium called _cleon_, in addition to which it will render the scar of\r\nthe same colour.\r\n\r\n_On procidentia._ Procidentia is a projection of the coat called uva\r\n(_iris?_), formed by an ulceration or rupture of the cornea. When,\r\ntherefore, it is small, so as to resemble the head of a fly, it is called\r\nmyocephalon. When it increases more, so as to resemble a grape-stone, it\r\nis called staphyloma; when it advances far forward, so as to protrude\r\nbetween the eyelids, it is called melon; and if it has become callous,\r\nit is called clavus. If, therefore, the projection is small, like the\r\nhead of a fly, we must use repellent and astringent applications, such\r\nas the chian, that called _fuscum_, the _nard_, and the _theodotian_,\r\nand those from olive leaves, and from horn. And we must bind upon them\r\nwithout pressure a piece of sponge which has been soaked in oxycrate,\r\nor astringent wine, or the decoction of roses, or the compress called\r\nsplenium may be used. The best application for procidentia, and all\r\nulcers of the eye, is the collyrium called _olympiac_ or _olympus_, with\r\nthe juice of olive, or of knot-grass, or of poley. The same things are\r\napplicable to clavus and staphyloma, before they whiten; for after they\r\nbecome white and callous, they are incurable.\r\n\r\n_On hypopyon._ Hypopyon occurs occasionally in the cornea, being\r\nsometimes deeply seated, and sometimes more superficially, the matter\r\nassuming the shape of a nail, and hence the affection has got the name\r\nof onyx. The indication of cure is either to dispel the pus by remedies\r\npossessing this property in a moderate degree, such as honied-water, and\r\nthe juice of fenugreek, and the collyria formed from it, the libyanum,\r\nand those from frankincense; or to make it burst, and cleanse the ulcer\r\nby means of the more potent remedies, such as those called _diasmyrna_\r\nand the _hygidian_. For cases of hypopyon without ulceration one may use\r\nthe following liquid collyrium: Of copperas, and of saffron, of each,\r\ndr. viij; of myrrh, dr. iv; of honey, lb. j. The phlyctæna, which is an\r\nelevation of the cornea, by a certain humour corroding its fibres, yields\r\nto the same treatment as hypopyon.\r\n\r\n_The liquid collyria of Bassus for hypopyon._ Of saffron, of aloes, and\r\nof myrrh, of each, oz. j; of wine, oz. iij; of the finest honey, oz.\r\nvj. The saffron is to be levigated with a small quantity of the wine,\r\nthen with the aloes and myrrh; and when it thickens, add the honey, and\r\nhaving mixed together, lay up in a glass vessel, and use twice a day, or,\r\nif the case be urgent, three times. It at the same time cleanses the eye\r\nand proves incarnating and cicatrizing.\r\n\r\n_On cicatrices and leucomata._ Superficial scars on the eye are called\r\nby some cicatrices, and by others nebulæ; but the more deeply seated are\r\ncalled leucomata. The proper remedies for them are those of a detergent\r\nand cleansing nature. Wherefore, nebulæ may be cleansed by the juice of\r\nanemone, and that of the small centaury, with honey; but the more chronic\r\nare reduced by cedar gum, or by copper alone levigated with water for a\r\ncollyrium, and by the cleansing collyria, such as that from hartshorn,\r\nand those called _rhinarian_, _hecatombe_, and the like. Leucomata may be\r\ncleared away by nitre carefully levigated with some old oil, and properly\r\nsmeared upon them, and by the shell of the cuttle-fish (_sepia_) burnt\r\nand pounded finely with honey. Among the collyria, the following one\r\nproves an excellent and mild detergent: Of mamira, of ammoniac perfume,\r\nof Troglodytic myrrh, of crocodile’s dung, equal parts; make a collyrium,\r\nand use. Levigate the dung of the land crocodile with water, and\r\nanoint, having formed it into a collyrium. You may also succeed well by\r\ndissolving Cappadocian salts in water, and then dissolving the collyria\r\nfor leucoma in it, and injecting it.\r\n\r\n_Dyes for cicatrices._ Of galls and acacia, of each dr. iv; of copperas,\r\ndr. ij; use. The following is a collyrium: Of the flowers of the\r\npomegranate, of copperas, of acacia, of gum, of each dr. iv; of antimony\r\nand galls, of each dr. ij; triturate with water. When the flowers of the\r\npomegranate are not at hand, you may use the internal membrane between\r\nthe seeds.\r\n\r\n_On pterygium._ Pterygium is a nervous (membranous?) excrescence of the\r\ntunica adnata, arising at the angle of the eye, and advancing to the\r\ncorona. When it increases greatly, it covers the pupil itself. Wherefore,\r\nlarge and chronic pterygia can only be extirpated by a surgical\r\noperation. But the smaller and more recent ones may be worn down by the\r\nabstergent applications, such as those used for trachoma and leucoma.\r\nAmong the simple remedies are burnt copper, and copperas with the gall\r\nof swine, which answer well. The following is a more potent remedy: Of\r\ncopperas, p. i, of gum, p. ss.; triturate with wine, and anoint, or form\r\ninto collyria. Some mix the gall of a goat with honey, and anoint with it.\r\n\r\n_For pterygium, hypopyon, and dimness of vision._ (From Oribasius.) Of\r\nthe magnet-stone, of scraped verdigris (xyston), of reddle, of ammoniac\r\nperfume, of each dr. iv; of saffron, dr. ij; of Attic honey half a\r\nspoonful. It also answers for leucoma.\r\n\r\n_For carbuncle and carcinoma._ Carcinoma is an affection of the cornea,\r\nattended with pain, distension, redness of the tunics, and pungent agony,\r\nextending to the temples, more particularly if shaken. They loathe\r\ntheir food, and have the pain increased by acrid things. The affection\r\nis incurable, but may be alleviated by a milk-diet, farinaceous and\r\notherwise wholesome food, devoid of all acrimony; and the injection of\r\nsoothing collyria, such as the Spodiac, Severianum, and the like. We must\r\npreviously attend that the general system be in a proper temperament.\r\nCarbuncle also is a malignant ulcer of the sloughy kind, forming\r\nsometimes in the ball of the eye, sometimes in the eyelid, as in the\r\nother parts of the body. In cases of carbuncle of the ball of the eye,\r\nwe must first evacuate with a clyster, and then purge moderately with\r\nboiled milk, afterwards foment with a sponge, and apply a cataplasm of\r\nthe flour of tares, or of wheat boiled in honied water, or sometimes we\r\nmay add pounded iris, and wash the eye with milk. If the ulcer spread,\r\nwe may apply a cataplasm of lentils with honey or boiled quinces: if\r\nit continue spreading, we may use the boiled leaves of the olive, the\r\nrind of the pomegranate boiled in wine and pounded with honey. When the\r\nulceration stops, and the eschar falls off by the application of the\r\nmedicine about to be described, and the ulcers have become clean, we may\r\napply a cataplasm of the roasted yelks of eggs, triturated with saffron\r\nand honey, until the ulcer is healed. The medicine is this: Of spodium,\r\ndr. iv; of myrrh not much toasted, dr. iij, and oboli iij; triturate in\r\nAminæan wine until it become dry, mix old Cretan sweet wine, and having\r\ntriturated, lay up the liquid in an earthen vessel, and anoint with it.\r\nFor carbuncles of the eyelids, having cut an acid pomegranate, boil it\r\nwhole in vinegar, and, when softened, pound and put it into a linen\r\ncloth, and use. Change twice or thrice during the day, and once during\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n_On mydriasis._ When the pupil does not appear changed in colour, but\r\nmuch wider than natural, and when it sometimes wholly impairs the\r\nvision, and sometimes nearly so, and when every object appears smaller,\r\nthe affection is called mydriasis. The cause of it is some redundant\r\nhumour. We must cure it by bleeding from the arm, or purging; but, if\r\nnot, by dividing the veins in the angles of the eye, and then applying a\r\ncupping instrument to the back part of the head, and bathing the face and\r\neyes with sea-water, or, if it be not at hand, with brine or oxycrate. We\r\nmust also use the remedies which are applicable to phyletænæ or blisters.\r\n\r\n_On phthisis and atrophy._ Phthisis is an affection of the pupil,\r\nwhich is contracted, and appears duller and more rugose than usual,\r\nbut objects seem larger than natural. The cause of it is condensation,\r\nmostly occasioned by dryness. Phthisis differs from atrophy in this, that\r\nphthisis renders the pupil contracted, whereas in atrophy the whole eye\r\nis smaller and more depressed. We may cure them by exercise, and rubbing\r\ncarefully the head, the face, and the eyes; by bathing the face with\r\nwater, and anointing the head with some healing ointment; and smearing\r\nthe eyes with an attenuant and acrid composition, such as the following:\r\nOf ammoniac, dr. j; of crocomagma, dr. iv; of saffron, dr. ij; of\r\nverdigris, dr. j. Triturate in water, form and use.\r\n\r\n_For nyctalopia._ In the disease called nyctalopia, the patient sees\r\nduring the day, but at sunset his vision becomes dimmer, and when night\r\ncomes on he does not see at all. We must effect the cure by bleeding\r\nfrom the arm and the angle of the eye, then purging or evacuating by a\r\nclyster, and afterwards ordering masticatories or sternutatories. Before\r\nfood, we give hyssop to drink, or rue; but, if the disease do not yield,\r\nwe must again administer the purgative medicine formed from scammony,\r\nand castor, anoint with clarified honey, and make the patient shut his\r\neyelids, so as to retain the liquid application. Or of burnt alum, p. ij;\r\nof fossile salt, p. j; triturate with honey and anoint.—_Another_: Having\r\nroasted the liver of a goat, collect the ichor during the roasting and\r\nanoint, but give the liver itself to eat; or boil, and direct the vapours\r\nto be received with open eyes.\r\n\r\n_For glaucoma and suffusion._ (From Ruffus.) The ancients considered\r\nglaucoma and suffusion as the same disease; but by their successors\r\nglaucoma has been accounted an affection of the crystalline humour,\r\nwhich is changed by a watery substance to a cerulean colour; but\r\nsuffusion is reckoned a defluxion of humours concreted between the cornea\r\nand the crystalline lens. Glaucoma is in every case incurable. Suffusion\r\nmay indeed be cured, but not always. We may try to cure suffusion before\r\nthe disease is completely formed, by taking blood from the arm, by\r\npurging and acrid clysters, such as those made from the decoction of\r\ncentaury, or of the bitter cucumber, and by keeping the bowels for some\r\ntime in a loose state. Cupping instruments with scarifications may be\r\napplied to the hind-head; the patient must drink water during the whole\r\nregimen, take attenuant food, and, in process of time, masticatories may\r\nbe used for a few days with advantage. When the vision is depraved, as,\r\nfor example, gnats appearing before the eyes, which case proceeds from a\r\ncacochymy or from bilious vapours ascending to the head, we may give for\r\na time the bitter medicine from aloes, or purge with it. To the eyes we\r\nmust make applications at first simple, such as honey and oil, with the\r\njuice of fennel, and afterwards compound, such as this: Of sagapene, dr.\r\nij; of Cyrenaic juice, of white hellebore, of each, dr. vj; triturate\r\nwith eight heminæ of honey. We, says Oribasius, use the following\r\nmedicine: Of the juice of wild carrots, of germander, of cresses, of\r\neach, equal parts; triturate. The following collyria are beneficial,\r\nnamely, that from the juice of the fennel, that called _proteus_, the\r\n_thalasseros_ and that from opobalsam. The collyria prepared from them\r\nare useful, and the decoction of fennel in the commencement answers well\r\nas a fomentation, and that from juices, opobalsam, honey, old oil, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\n_On amaurosis and dimness of sight._ Amaurosis is, for the most part, a\r\ncomplete impediment of the sight without any apparent affection about the\r\neye; and dimness of sight is an imperfection of vision arising without\r\nany sensible cause. The same mode of cure as that described for suffusion\r\napplies generally in this case; but, in particular, blood may be\r\nabstracted from the corners of the eye, leeches applied to the temples,\r\nand friction of the extremities. In process of time we must have recourse\r\nto sternutatories, emetics with an empty stomach, and the application of\r\nointments, at first with equal parts of honey and oil, and afterwards\r\nwith the under-mentioned composition: Of saffron, two oboli; of the gall\r\nof the hyæna, dr. j; of common pepper, eighty-five grains; of fennel\r\njuice, dr. xvj; of ammoniac perfume, dr. j. Triturate the dry substances\r\nwith the juice, add four spoonfuls of honey, prepare and lay up in a\r\ncopper vessel for use. Before using, let him foment the eyes by immersing\r\nthem in hot sea-water.\r\n\r\n_On strabismus, or squinting._ Congenital squinting is cured by the\r\napplication of a mask, so that the children are compelled to look\r\nstraight forwards; for strabismus is a spasmodic affection of the muscles\r\nwhich move the ball of the eye. And the lamp should be placed fairly\r\nopposite, and not so as to shine obliquely. When the eye is turned to\r\nthe nose, purple flocks of wool should be fastened to the outer angle of\r\nthe eye, so that by looking steadily at them, the persons affected may\r\ncorrect the state of the eyes.\r\n\r\n_On ecpiesmus._ The eyes are sometimes forced out, so as to remain\r\nprominent. When this happens from strangulation, we must let blood\r\nfrom the arm; but if otherwise, we must purge with black hellebore or\r\nscammony. When the eyes become prominent from the pain of labour, the\r\ncomplaint is often removed by the cleansing after parturition; hence we\r\nought to promote it; and, in men, after phlebotomy, if it do not abate,\r\nwe may affix a cupping instrument to the back part of the head, and apply\r\nwool smeared with honey, or flocks of it with water, and bind a compress\r\ngently above it. Cold salt water poured upon the face is likewise\r\nsuitable to them, and also the juice of endive and knot-grass, rubbed in\r\nwith the juice of poppy, and whatever else can repress and contract.\r\n\r\n_On synchysis, or confusion._ Confusion of the sight occasioned by a blow\r\nmay be cured by bleeding from the arm, and by filling the whole eye with\r\nthe blood of a newly-slaughtered animal, of a turtle in particular, but,\r\nif not, of a pigeon, and then applying soft wool which has been immersed\r\nin an egg beaten up with wine and rose-oil, and binding it on the place.\r\nThe same thing is to be done next day; and on the third, it is to be\r\nfomented, washed with milk, and suitable cataplasms applied; after which\r\nit is to be anointed with the remedies for old affections, such as Chiac.\r\n\r\n_For myopia._ Those persons are called myopes, or near-sighted, who, from\r\ntheir births, see near objects, but not those at a distance. Such a state\r\nis wholly incurable, being occasioned by a weakness of the optic spirit.\r\nOld men are affected in the opposite manner to these, for they do not\r\nperceive near objects, but see those at a distance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY.

By disorder of the eye\r\n(_taraxis_), they meant an inferior degree of ophthalmy, as is remarked\r\nby Turnebus. (Bernard’s Nonnus, 45.) It is, therefore, the mild acute\r\nophthalmy of Scarpa. The remedies enumerated by Hippocrates for pains of\r\nthe eyes are thus given in the language of Celsus: “Sanguinis detractio,\r\nmedicamentum, balneum, vinum.” Drinking wine might appear to us at first\r\nsight not a very likely mode of curing ophthalmies; and yet Galen, in\r\nhis Commentary on this Aphorism (vi, 31), has related a case in which\r\nit effected a cure after every other remedy had failed. Even Scarpa\r\nallows the correctness of the aphorism as a rule of practice, and states\r\nthat wine and the cold bath are proper when the disease is kept up by\r\nexcessive irritability. Alexander recommends wine and the tepid bath\r\nwhen the inflammation arises from thick and pituitous blood. Philagrius,\r\nas quoted by Theophilus in his ‘Scholia on Hippocrates,’ indicates\r\nthat the wine should be white, sweet, new, and if the patient’s head\r\nbe delicate, diluted with water. (See further, t. ii, 501, ed. Dietz.)\r\nMesue makes many interesting remarks upon the above-mentioned remedies of\r\nHippocrates. For further explanation of the rationale of this practice,\r\nsee Schelhammer (de Tumoribus), and Littré (Hippocrat. t. iv, 418.)\r\nAnother of Hippocrates’ aphorisms is, that a spontaneous diarrhœa is\r\na favorable occurrence in ophthalmy; upon which Galen remarks, that,\r\nin imitation of nature’s method of removing the complaint, physicians\r\nare in the practice of producing an artificial looseness by means of\r\ncathartics and clysters. Lead is an ingredient in several of Alexander’s\r\ncollyria. For periodical ophthalmy, Hippocrates recommends purging the\r\nhead and bowels; and in certain cases bleeding, cupping, and restricted\r\ndiet. Celsus, Galen, and, in short, most of the ancient authorities make\r\nmention of narcotics, such as opium and mandragora, but do not approve\r\nof them as common remedies. Galen, however, instances ophthalmy as one\r\nof the species of inflammation in which opium is admissible. (De Optima\r\nSecta, 9.) Alexander, in like manner, cautions against the indiscriminate\r\nuse of opium to lull the pain. Some of his prescriptions for collyria,\r\nhowever, contain opium. Galen recommends scarifications in chronic\r\ndefluxions of the eye. Aëtius lays down very proper rules respecting\r\npurging, fomentations, venesection, and baths. He properly remarks\r\nregarding the use of wine, that it is only applicable when the patient\r\nis of a dry and cold intemperament. Celsus is a decided advocate for\r\nfomentations with hot water in all cases of ophthalmy.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians treat ophthalmy upon the same principles as the Greeks,\r\nwithout supplying much additional information. Mesue, like our author,\r\nrecommends bleeding by opening the temporal artery, which operation he\r\ndescribes minutely. When the bleeding cannot be stopped otherwise, he\r\ndirects us to secure the vessel with a silk thread. He also makes mention\r\nof leeching and the actual cautery. He is very minute in his directions\r\nabout his collyria. One of his anodyne collyria consists of the juice of\r\nhyoscyamus, mandragora, and opium; and another contains camphor, saffron,\r\nhyoscyamus, and the like. The use of narcotics, however, is forbid by\r\nJesu Haly. Rhases also rather disapproves of them. Avicenna makes mention\r\nof bleeding by the temporal arteries, the angular vein of the nose, and\r\nthe frontal. When the usual remedies do not succeed, he approves of the\r\ncautery; and, in certain cases, recommends strongly the use of stimulant\r\napplications, such as æs ustum, copperas, and arsenic. Galen, in like\r\nmanner, makes mention of arsenic, and also of misy, sori, and chalcitis\r\n(substances resembling our sulphate of copper) among his remedies for\r\ndiseases of the eye. Having ourselves had occasion to use arsenic in\r\ncertain malignant diseases of the eyelids, and not having found that it\r\nproduced any serious disorder in the ball of the eye, we would call the\r\nattention of modern oculists to this medicine as one from which, when\r\nproperly managed, the best results may be expected. When the ophthalmy is\r\nof a cold nature, Avicenna approves of treating it by an attenuant diet,\r\nthe bath, and white wine. In certain cases he directs us to pour cold\r\nwater on the head. Haly Abbas describes three varieties of ophthalmy. The\r\nfirst arises from manifest causes, such as the sun, dust, and the like;\r\nand is to be cured by bleeding, purging, and cooling lotions, containing\r\nrose-oil, camphor, &c. In the second, the symptoms are more severe,\r\nbeing attended with greater redness and pain. It also is to be cured by\r\nbleeding, cupping, and emollient collyria. The third variety is chemosis.\r\nAlsaharavius treats of the disease at great length. When it is connected\r\nwith a bilious cause, he directs us to purge, use the bath, apply vapours\r\nto the eye, and soothing collyria. Serapion, like Haly, describes three\r\nvarieties of the disease by the names of _tarkinisis_, _noutelinie_,\r\nand _kermufil_. Jesu Haly recommends general bleeding, purging, and\r\nfomentations, with the decoctions of fenugreek and fennel, for ophthalmy.\r\nIt remains to be mentioned that Galen, Alexander Aphrodisiensis, and all\r\nthe Arabian authorities have placed ophthalmy in the list of contagious\r\ndiseases. See, in particular, Alex. Aph. (Prob. i, 35), and our brief\r\nsketch of the history of ancient opinions on contagion in the Second\r\nBook, Sect. XXXVI. The celebrated Fracastorius confidently maintains that\r\nophthalmy is contagious. (De Morb. Contag.) And we may further mention\r\nthat all the authorities of the middle ages speak of ophthalmy as being\r\ncontagious.\r\n\r\n_On chemosis._ By chemosis, modern oculists (as, for example, Scarpa)\r\nunderstand that state of ophthalmy when blood, owing to a rupture of one\r\nor more vessels, is effused into the cellular membrane which connects\r\nthe conjunctiva to the anterior hemisphere of the eye. Our author’s\r\naccount is mostly taken from Oribasius, who, in his turn, borrows from\r\nDemosthenes. Galen and Octavius Horatianus, without saying anything of\r\nthe general treatment, merely recommend us to apply upon a clean linen\r\ncloth flies pounded with the yelk of an egg. Chemosis is Haly’s third\r\nvariety of ophthalmy, for which he recommends copious and repeated\r\nbleeding, cupping, gentle laxatives, cataplasms containing poppies when\r\nthe pain is violent, and other soothing collyria. Alsaharavius, in like\r\nmanner, recommends depletion and emollient fomentations. Serapion, among\r\nother things, mentions soothing fomentations. In chemosis, according\r\nto Rhases, all the symptoms of ophthalmy are particularly strong and\r\nviolent; the eyelids being swelled and everted, and the white of the eye\r\nappearing black. He recommends local and general bleeding, purging, and\r\nastringent applications.\r\n\r\n_On hyposphagma and emphysema._ Hyposphagma is not described by any\r\nparticular name in modern surgical works. Besides the local applications\r\nmentioned by our author, Aëtius properly recommends general treatment,\r\nwe mean bleeding, purging, and the like. Avicenna also makes mention\r\nof venesection and arteriotomy. Haly describes the disease by the name\r\nof _tumor oculi_ as his first variety of _inflatio_. Alsaharavius uses\r\nthe same term. Serapion treats of it by the name of _sanguis divisus in\r\noculo_, recommending treatment similar to our author’s. See also Celsus\r\n(vi, 6.)\r\n\r\nThe emphysema appears to have been a sort of œdema seated below the\r\neyelid. Aëtius remarks that it occurs principally in old men. We have\r\noften seen it in them. He recommends fomentations by means of a sponge,\r\nrubbing the eyelid within with honey, pouring hot water on the head,\r\nusing baths, drinking wine, and even bleeding at the arm. This last\r\nmeasure is omitted by our author, and must be unnecessary in general. It\r\nis described by Haly Abbas as his second variety of _inflatio oculi_. He\r\nsays it is an œdematous swelling principally affecting old men in summer.\r\nHe recommends collyria of a sharp penetrating nature, and various other\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n_On psorophthalmia, sclerophthalmia, and xerophthalmia._ For these\r\naffections Aëtius gives various prescriptions containing calamine, burnt\r\ncopper, chalcitis, and the like. Similar ones may be found in Galen (sec.\r\nloc.) Galen, like our author, recommends fomentations, by means of a\r\nsponge, with hot water or the decoction of poppies. One of Alexander’s\r\nprescriptions for psorophthalmia contains arsenic. Celsus describes the\r\nsymptoms and treatment of xerophthalmia very minutely: “Neque tument,\r\nneque fluunt oculi, sed rubent tantum, et cum dolore quodam graves\r\nsunt, et noctu præ gravi pituita inhærescunt.” He gives the sum of\r\nhis treatment in this short sentence: “In hoc vitio multum ambulare,\r\nmultum exerceri, lavari sæpe, ibique desudare, multâque frictione uti\r\nnecessarium est.” He also prescribes gargles, food of a middle quality,\r\nand various compound collyria, such as the rhinion which contained burnt\r\ncopper, myrrh, Phrygian stone, &c. This affection, the dry ophthalmy,\r\nhad been described by Hippocrates (Aph. iii, 12, 14.) Most probably, as\r\nSichel suggests, it was the same as the catarrhal ophthalmy. See Littré\r\n(Hippocrat. t. iv, 418.) Celsus recommends this collyrium also for\r\nthe psorophthalmia, which he describes by the name of _scabri oculi_.\r\nFor this last-mentioned affection he recommends various stimulant\r\napplications; and, when other remedies are not at hand, directs us to\r\napply bread pounded in wine. The psorophthalmia is the _prurigo oculi_ of\r\nHaly Abbas, for which, among other things, he recommends a composition\r\ncontaining pepper, sal ammoniac, saffron, spikenard, camphor, &c. He\r\ndescribes sclerophthalmia by the name of _durities oculi_, and recommends\r\nfor it bleeding, gentle purgatives, emollient collyria, &c.\r\n\r\n_On ectropion._ Aëtius, in like manner, recommends compositions\r\ncontaining ærugo æris, misy, and chalcitis. None of the subsequent\r\nauthorities supply any additional information. Alsaharavius in particular\r\ngives a very accurate account of the disease, which, when it arises from\r\na fungous excrescence growing from the inner side of the eyelid, he\r\ndirects us to burn with caustics; but, when it arises from a cicatrix, it\r\nis to be cured only by a surgical operation. This will be found described\r\nin the Sixth Book. In place of the caustics recommended by the ancients,\r\nScarpa directs the argentum nitratum to be applied.\r\n\r\n_On ægilops and anchilops._ These are different stages of the disease\r\nnow known by the name of fistula lachrymalis. Galen states that at the\r\ncommencement it is to be cured by applications which are repellent\r\nwithout being too stimulant. He gives a full account of the treatment\r\nrecommended by Archigenes. The first application mentioned by him is\r\na cataplasm consisting of tares and honey. Scarpa, by the way, speaks\r\nfavorably of the practice of Ægineta, Aëtius, and Avicenna. Avicenna\r\ntreats of the disease with great judgment. His first applications\r\nappear to have been intended to produce resolution; and, if these fail,\r\nsuppuratives are to be applied. When the abscess bursts, the sore is to\r\nbe reduced to a healthy state by escharotic powders containing alum,\r\nlimatura æris, sal ammoniac, and the like. When these fail, a surgical\r\noperation must be had recourse to. This is described in the Sixth Book.\r\nMesue also has treated of the disease at great length. Haly Abbas\r\ndescribes the disease very correctly. He says, “Aliquando autem ejus\r\nsanies ad nares defluit per foramen quod inter oculum est et nasum.” This\r\npassage puts it beyond a doubt that the ancients were acquainted with\r\nthe lachrymal duct. The disease, he says, sometimes occasions caries of\r\nthe cartilages (_os unguis?_). When it is recent, he recommends bleeding\r\nand laxatives; and when it gets into a fistulous state, he directs us to\r\nuse applications containing arsenic, sal ammoniac, cantharides, alum,\r\n&c. Alsaharavius mentions that the abscess of the lachrymal sack may\r\neither burst outwards or into the nose. It would appear, therefore, that\r\nhe also was acquainted with the natural structure of these parts. One of\r\nthe applications recommended by Rhases for fistula lachrymalis contains\r\narsenic, quicklime, and vitriol. Another is prepared from litharge,\r\narsenic, and oil. These applications are mentioned by the earlier of the\r\nmodern authorities on medicine. See Theodoricus (iii, 2.)\r\n\r\nThe protostactos mentioned by our author was a composition consisting of\r\npotass and lime. (See Book Seventh, _in voce_, κονία.)\r\n\r\n_On trachoma._ This affection does not appear to be noticed in our\r\nlate treatises on diseases of the eye, and yet in our own practice\r\nwe have met with some cases of it. Rowley mentions it as an asperity\r\nof the internal superficies of the eyelid. Celsus describes it by\r\nthe name of _aspritudo_. In severe cases, he says, some scarify the\r\ninside of the eyelid with a fig leaf, a rough probe, or a scalpel. But\r\nin ordinary cases, he rather approves of using exercises, frequent\r\nbaths, fomentations with hot water, attenuant food, and escharotics,\r\nsuch as copperas, misy, antimony, and the like. Galen and Aëtius give\r\nprescriptions for various collyria. They consist principally of detergent\r\nand caustic substances, such as sal ammoniac, squama æris, calamine, and\r\nthe like. It seems to be the disease which Haly Abbas treats of by the\r\nname of lapidositas. (Pr. v, 51.)\r\n\r\n_On chalazion._ We will treat more fully of the nature of this tumour in\r\nour notes on Section XVI of the Sixth Book. It appears to be the species\r\nof encysted tumour said by Scarpa to be well described by M. Aurelius\r\nSeverinus. (On Diseases of the Eye, 3.) Rowley describes it as a moveable\r\ntumour in the margin of the eyelids. Aëtius recommends us to open the\r\ntumour with a scalpel, and apply to it escharotics, such as burnt copper,\r\nchalcitis, and red arsenic. By Haly Abbas it is called _grando_, and\r\nthe remedy mentioned by our author is recommended by him. Alsaharavius\r\ndescribes it as a gross humour congealed in one of the eyelids. He\r\ndescribes by the name of _alsaanac_ a fatty tumour of the eyelids which\r\nwe have sometimes met with and extracted. On the chalazion, see Celsus\r\n(vii, 7), and Isidorus (Orig. iv, 8.)\r\n\r\n_On hordeolum._ Most of the ancient authors treat of this trifling\r\ncomplaint in much the same terms as our author. Scarpa evidently is\r\nmistaken in making the hordeolum and chalazion to be the same complaint.\r\nHaly Abbas describes it as being an oblong abscess resembling a grain of\r\nbarley on the extremity of the eyelid. He recommends general depletion,\r\nand nearly the same remedies as our author; also a cataplasm of galbanum.\r\nAlsaharavius treats of it in a similar manner. Rhases particularly\r\nrecommends melted wax as an application to it. He also speaks favorably\r\nof the diachylon plaster.\r\n\r\n_On lice in the eyebrows._ Stavesacre is a very ancient remedy for\r\npediculi on all parts of the body. Celsus lays down very minute\r\ndirections for the constitutional treatment, and recommends a local\r\napplication containing sandarach, or the red sulphuret of arsenic.\r\nAvicenna makes mention of sulphurous baths. Haly Abbas recommends general\r\npurging, various stimulant applications, and abstinence from figs. Our\r\nauthor states, in Section LXXXI of the First Book, that figs engender\r\nlice. Alsaharavius directs the eyebrows to be rubbed with sal ammoniac,\r\nalum, salts, &c. Jesu Haly recommends purging with hiera, the frequent\r\nuse of the bath, and applications containing stavesacre, sulphur, alum,\r\nnitre, sal ammoniac, vinegar of squills, and the like. Rhases recommends\r\na powder containing quicksilver.\r\n\r\n_On madarosis, or milphosis, and ptilosis._ Aëtius, Actuarius, and\r\nNonnus treat of these diseases in similar terms. The calliblephara are\r\nfully described by Galen (sec. loc. iv.) Haly Abbas seems to allude to\r\nthese complaints in the following sentence: “Palpebrarum autem casus ex\r\nhumiditate fit acutâ aut alopetia, et quidam fit cum palpebrarum grossite\r\net duritie, ruboreque, et dolore.” His remedies are like our author’s.\r\nThe same may be said of Alsaharavius.\r\n\r\n_On trichiasis._ Our author’s treatment is mostly imitated from Galen. We\r\nshall treat more fully of the disease in the Sixth Book. Scarpa places\r\nno confidence in the operation of plucking out the hair, and yet it is\r\nfavorably spoken of by most of the Greek and Arabian authorities, as,\r\nfor example, Aëtius, Avicenna, Alsaharavius, and Haly Abbas; and also by\r\nRowley, and other modern oculists. Haly, like our author, directs us to\r\ntouch the part from which the hair has been plucked with the blood of\r\na frog, or of a dog’s tick, or with the milk of a fig, or the gall of\r\na hedgehog. Alsaharavius makes mention of the same remedies, and also\r\nof the mode of treating it by agglutinants. According to Actuarius, the\r\ndisease consists in certain of the ciliary hairs being turned inwards and\r\nhurting the eyeball. (ii, 7.)\r\n\r\n_On encanthis and rhyas._ Scarpa removes the encanthis by a surgical\r\noperation; but, from our own experience of the effect of septic\r\nmedicines, such as arsenic, in similar complaints, we cannot doubt the\r\npropriety of the ancient practice in certain cases. Galen’s applications\r\ncontain copperas, misy, sal ammoniac, and the like. Those of Aëtius\r\nare nearly the same. He remarks that seamen are particularly liable to\r\nthe complaint. Haly Abbas recommends general evacuation and escharotic\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n_On ulcers._ In the description of the ulcers of the eye our author\r\nfollows Aëtius. He, however, evidently was much indebted to Galen (sec.\r\nloc. iv.) The Arabians copy from Galen, describing like him seven\r\nvarieties of ulcer, which they treat upon general principles. See, in\r\nparticular, Haly Abbas (Pract. v, 41.) Opium is one of his medicinal\r\narticles. Ceruse, starch, gum arabic, albumen, &c. also occur. See also\r\nJesu Haly (ii, 50,) and Rhases (Cont. ii.) Celsus recommends various\r\ncompound applications for ulcers of the eye, which he treats of very\r\nminutely.\r\n\r\nThe collyria mentioned in this section will be found described in the\r\nSeventh Book of this work.\r\n\r\n_On procidentia._ Galen correctly describes procidentia as arising from\r\nulceration of the cornea and protrusion of the iris. (De Diff. Morb.\r\n13.) Aëtius has treated of it with his usual accuracy. He recommends\r\nvarious escharotic applications containing chalcitis, misy, and the like,\r\nwhich, when properly managed, may probably have answered the purpose\r\nequally well with the antimonium muriatum and argentum nitratum used by\r\nScarpa and other modern oculists. Avicenna treats of the complaint like\r\nthe Greeks. Some of his compositions contain antimony with ceruse, burnt\r\nlead, and the like. Haly Abbas describes the disease minutely in nearly\r\nthe same terms, and recommends nearly the same remedies as our author,\r\nnamely, such as are of a repressing nature. He properly remarks that it\r\nis one of the consequences of ulceration of the cornea. Alsaharavius\r\ngives a similar account, and recommends general depletion.\r\n\r\n_On hypopyon._ Aëtius gives much more judicious directions for the\r\ntreatment of this complaint than our author. He properly recommends\r\ngeneral bloodletting at the commencement, and afterwards local, by means\r\nof leeches and cupping instruments; and then emollient, paregoric, and\r\ndiscutient applications to the eye. Galen (Meth. Med.) makes mention of\r\nan oculist in his time who effected wonderful cures in this complaint\r\nby shaking the patient’s head. When this does not succeed, Galen\r\ndirects us to perforate the coats of the eye, and let out the matter.\r\n(See Book Sixth.) Scarpa does not approve of this practice, unless the\r\ncollection of matter be considerable. However, Plempius and most of the\r\nearlier modern authorities in surgery decidedly recommend it. Haly Abbas\r\nrecommends a discutient cataplasm containing opopanax, ammoniac, and\r\nfenugreek. Alsaharavius properly directs bleeding and masticatories at\r\nthe commencement.\r\n\r\n_On leucoma._ Aëtius directs his attention principally to the general\r\ntreatment, and properly cautions against the use of strongly stimulant\r\napplications, as they only increase the evil. He allows afterwards\r\nmoderately detergent ones, containing verdigris, burnt copper, squama\r\næris, flos æris, sal ammoniac, and the like. His compositions are taken\r\nfor the most part from Galen’s works (de Med. sec. loc. iv.) Aëtius\r\ndisapproves of applications for changing the colour of the leucoma.\r\nAlexander recommends the detergent applications mentioned by our author.\r\nNonnus copies from him. Haly Abbas describes it by the name of _albedo\r\noculi_, and recommends nearly the same remedies as our author. He\r\nparticularly praises green glass finely pulverized, which is still a\r\npopular remedy in Scotland. Alsaharavius makes mention of the juice of\r\nthe lesser centaury as an useful application. Scarpa speaks favorably\r\nof this remedy, and further recommends the Sapphirian collyrium, the\r\ningredients of which are similar to those which entered into the ancient\r\napplications. It consists of a solution of scr. ij of sal ammoniac\r\nand gr. iv of ærugo in oz. viij of aqua calcis, allowed to stand for\r\ntwenty-four hours, and then filtered. Rhases recommends an ointment\r\ncontaining arsenic.\r\n\r\n_On pterygium._ Aëtius correctly remarks that pterygium generally begins\r\nfrom the inner canthus, rarely from the outer, and scarce ever from above\r\nor below. He gives prescriptions for a variety of applications, which,\r\nlike our author’s, contain burnt copperas, magnesian stone, sal ammoniac,\r\nand the like. Galen briefly commends the same. Nonnus, Serapion, and\r\nthe others approve of this practice. Modern oculists, however, trust to\r\nnothing but the operation, which will be described in the Sixth Book.\r\nHaly Abbas describes the disease very accurately by the name of _ungula_;\r\nand recommends general bleeding, purging, restricted diet, and a variety\r\nof collyria. Alsaharavius gives the same account of the ungula, and\r\nwhen it becomes callous (nervosus), recommends an operation. Jesu Haly\r\nrecommends, before attempting a surgical operation, to make trial of\r\nescharotic applications. Rhases also approves of this plan of treatment.\r\nThe most active ingredients in his prescriptions are sal ammoniac,\r\ncopperas, and arsenic. Some of his compositions are merely detergent.\r\n\r\n_On carbuncle and cancer._ we are not aware that the parts about the eye\r\nare particularly liable to anthrax, nor do we recollect to have ever\r\nmet with such a case; and yet, as Alexander and our author remark, the\r\ndisease may occur there as well as in other parts of the body. Rowley\r\ndescribes carbuncle both of the eye and eyelids. Aëtius has given a\r\nvery circumstantial account of the symptoms and treatment of anthrax.\r\nHe forbids the early application of cataplasms, and seems to depend\r\nmost upon constitutional treatment, by clysters, purging, and bleeding.\r\nAfterwards cooling and styptic fomentations are to be applied by means of\r\na sponge, along with other treatment similar to our author’s. Alexander’s\r\nplan of treatment is nearly the same, and is laid down with excellent\r\njudgment. That of Oribasius is similar.\r\n\r\nTo relieve the pains of cancer, Aëtius recommends soothing applications\r\nand an anti-stimulant diet, consisting principally of milk. Avicenna,\r\nAlsaharavius, and most of the ancient authorities join in praising\r\nmilk as the principal article of food in cancer of the eye. Avicenna’s\r\napplications contain ceruse, opium, and the like. Haly Abbas recommends\r\ngeneral bleeding, if the patient’s strength permit, with emollient\r\nlotions, and collyria: the diet to consist of birds, kids, and lambs.\r\nAccording to Rhases, cancer of the eye is attended with excruciating\r\npains, redness, and distension of the veins, loss of appetite, and\r\ninability to bear all applications.\r\n\r\n_On mydriasis._ Aëtius treats mydriasis, or preternatural dilatation of\r\nthe pupil, like our author, by general and local bleeding, clysters, an\r\nattenuant diet, and friction of the extremities. They no doubt considered\r\nthat the disease arises from congestion in the brain. Avicenna refers\r\nthe disease to cephalæa and injuries of the head. Scarpa quotes with\r\napprobation the account given by Celsus of mydriasis, by which he thinks\r\nwas meant not only cases of dilated pupil but also of incipient amaurosis\r\noccurring suddenly. Celsus approves of opening the bowels freely. Haly\r\nAbbas describes the disease, but thinks it almost incurable. It sometimes\r\noccurs, he says, from a blow, and sometimes from abscess within the uva.\r\nAlsaharavius attributes the disease to congestion, and directs bleeding,\r\npurging, and cooling applications. He calls it _dilatatio_. According to\r\nJesu Haly, it is produced by dryness of the uva, or abscess within that\r\ntunic, or pressure on the brain. The first species is to be relieved\r\nby diluents and relaxants, such as the warm bath. For the second he\r\nrecommends suitable cataplasms and purgative pills. The third is to be\r\ntreated by general and local bleeding, cupping, and fomentations with\r\nwater, vinegar, and salt. _Constriction of the pupil_ he directs us\r\nto treat upon the same principles as our author. His account of it is\r\nmostly taken from Aëtius. Leo describes, under the name of _symptosis_,\r\nconstriction of the pupil; under that of _paremptosis_, an affection of\r\nthe optic nerves; under that of _platycoria_, a preternatural dilatation\r\nof the pupil, for which he recommends astringents; and under that\r\nof _myocephalos_, procidentia of the lens, for which he recommends\r\nastringents, and even copperas.\r\n\r\n_On nyctalopia._ Aëtius recommends, according to the circumstances of\r\nthe case, general and local bleeding, drastic purgatives, errhines, and\r\nthe like. He, Celsus, Alexander, Rhases, Avicenna, Mesue, Jesu Haly,\r\nHaly Abbas, and Alsaharavius, like our author, speak favorably of the\r\napplication from the roasted liver of a goat. Instead of it Hippocrates\r\nrecommends the liver of an ox. His treatment otherwise consists of\r\nbleeding, purging with elaterium, and, in desperate cases, of trepanning\r\nthe head at the bregma and evacuating the water. (De Visu.) The general\r\ntreatment of the Arabians is like that of the Greeks. Thus Alsaharavius\r\nrecommends bleeding, purging with hiera, gargles, sternutatories, and the\r\nlike. This is also the practice of Jesu Haly.\r\n\r\nThe term nyctalopia is not used by all the ancient authorities in the\r\nsame sense. Thus Hippocrates applies it to that morbid state of vision in\r\nwhich the patient is blind during the day but sees better in the evening.\r\nAëtius, Alexander, Paulus, and Actuarius, on the contrary, apply it to\r\nthat state in which the patient sees clearly during the day but becomes\r\nblind in the evening.\r\n\r\n_On glaucoma and suffusion._ Aëtius and Oribasius give nearly the same\r\naccount of these complaints as Paulus, and yet that of Aëtius seems\r\nslightly different. He says that there are two kinds of glaucoma: that\r\nthe first, to which the name is properly applied, arises from a dryness\r\nand concretion of the crystalline humour, which is changed to a sea-green\r\n(glaucum) colour; but that the other arises from a suffusion, the humour\r\nnear the pupil having become congealed and dry. According to Leo, the\r\naffection of glaucoma arises when the crystalline humour is congealed, as\r\nit were, and having become white, obstructs vision: this occurs in old\r\nage and is incurable. Haly Abbas was aware that the disease is sometimes\r\nseated in the crystalline lens, but did not know that it always is so.\r\nHippocrates recommends masticatories and the actual cautery. Haly Abbas\r\nand Alsaharavius approve of making trial of remedies similar to those\r\nmentioned by our author, before attempting the operation. Rhases forbids\r\nbleeding when the disease arises from the state of the eye itself.\r\nCanamusali, who flourished about the year 1258, recommends a seton in\r\nthe nape of the neck for the cure of suffusion. (De Oculis, vi.) Rhases\r\nconsiders the case incurable when the pupil has become insensible to the\r\nstimulus of light.\r\n\r\n_On amaurosis and dimness of vision._ Galen and Aëtius give a very\r\ncircumstantial account of the causes and treatment of amaurosis. They\r\nstate that the disease either comes on suddenly, in which case they refer\r\nits origin to obstruction and paralysis of the optic nerve, or gradually,\r\nwhen they believe it occasioned by a thickening of the coats of the optic\r\nnerve, or a change of the spirits, or of the humours of the eye. They\r\nenumerate various causes of it, such as injuries of the head, heat or\r\ncold, indigestion, or the like. When the disease occurs suddenly, they\r\napprove of general or local bleeding, such as cupping the back part of\r\nthe head, and active purging. In the other case general depletion is not\r\nrequired, but the treatment is otherwise nearly the same, attention being\r\nparticularly paid to the state of the bowels. They forbid emetics after\r\nfood, but approve of errhines. They recommend in certain cases sinapisms\r\nto the head.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians treat the disease upon the same principles. Haly Abbas\r\ndescribes amaurosis among the affections of the optic nerves, and\r\nrecommends for it general bleeding, purging, and the saffron collyrium.\r\nAlsaharavius remarks that it often arises from the state of the stomach,\r\nwhich, in that case, will require the principal attention. Avenzoar\r\nblames Galen for giving up as desperate cases of amaurosis which occur\r\nsuddenly. He recommends general and local bleeding, with repellent\r\napplications to the head.\r\n\r\n_On strabismus._ See Galen (de Causis Morborum); Oribasius (Synops. viii,\r\n49.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna properly remarks that squinting is occasioned by debility or\r\nspasm of some of the muscles of the eye. He and Rhases recommend the\r\nsame treatment as our author. Avicenna also makes mention of a mask.\r\nHaly Abbas, who appears to have been intimately acquainted with anatomy,\r\nof which his work contains a valuable compendium, explains minutely the\r\ncause of the disease, which he attributes to an unequal contraction of\r\nthe muscles of the eye. See also Alsaharavius and Jesu Haly. Jesu, like\r\nour author, directs us to fasten a piece of black or red cloth on the\r\nangle of the eye at the temples, when the eye inclines towards the nose.\r\nHe correctly explains that the complaint arises from spasms or paralysis\r\nof some of the muscles of the eye.\r\n\r\n_On ecpiesmus, or protrusion of the eyes._ This section is taken from\r\nOribasius. (Syn. viii, 50.)\r\n\r\nAëtius, Avicenna, and Rhases recommend the same treatment for this\r\ncomplaint, which can only arise from suffocation, violent straining, or\r\nswelling of the eye.\r\n\r\n_On synchysis, or confusion of sight._ Aëtius and Oribasius treat of this\r\naffection in nearly the same words.\r\n\r\nRowley defines _synchysis_ to be “a solution of the vitreous humour into\r\na fine attenuated aqueous fluid.” It does not appear to us that the\r\nancients understood it in this sense, or that they meant anything more by\r\nit than a confusion or disorder of the eye occasioned by a blow.\r\n\r\n_On myopia._ This section also is taken from Oribasius or Aëtius.\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius treats of it by the name of _alhayn_. He says it sometimes\r\narises from external causes, such as exposure to snow and cold, in which\r\ncase he directs us to apply stimulant fumes to the eye and refrigerants\r\nto the head. Although the ancients were aware of the magnifying powers\r\nof _specula_ (as appears from Seneca, ‘Quæst. Natur.’), it is doubtful\r\nif they ever thought of applying this knowledge to any useful purpose;\r\nand hence none of the Greek, Latin, or Arabian medical authors make\r\nany mention of spectacles or magnifying glasses as a remedy for this\r\ncomplaint, or for weakness of sight. Dutens, however, maintains that they\r\nwere not unacquainted with telescopes. (p. ii, 10.) From a passage in\r\nIamblichus it has been supposed that they also used microscopes. (Vit.\r\nPyth. 26.)\r\n\r\nOne of the causes of myopia mentioned by Jesu Haly is enlargement of the\r\ncrystalline lens, which he recommends us to endeavour to lessen by means\r\nof dissolvents. (De Oculis, iii, 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXIII.—OF DISEASES OF THE EAR; AND, FIRST, CONCERNING PAIN OF IT.\r\n\r\nEarach may be known to be occasioned by cold from the season of the\r\nyear, the preceding regimen, or from the patient’s own account, if it\r\nproceed from any external exciting cause. If the pain be deep-seated\r\nwithout heaviness, distension, or heat, such cases are to be cured by\r\ncalefacient remedies, as hot oil of rue, or of nard, or hot oil of bays,\r\nor that of marjoram, that called _foliatum_, or that called _spicatum_,\r\nor common oil with euphorbium, or pepper, or castor, or the ointment\r\ncalled _commagenum_, or opobalsam poured into the auditory foramen; and\r\noil in which garlic or onion has been boiled is of service when injected.\r\nPain from a hot intemperament is judged of by a certain sensation of heat\r\nwithout heaviness or tension. You may cure it by the opposite remedies;\r\nby injecting the white of an egg triturated, as in affections of the\r\neye; and woman’s milk, along with some of the anodyne collyria, or the\r\njuice of perdicias (_pellitory of the wall?_), with a small quantity of\r\nrose-oil, and rose-oil itself, or rose-oil and vinegar, or the juice\r\nof the nightshade, or of coriander, or of kingspear, or oil in which\r\nearthworms or millepedes have been boiled; or almond-oil, either by\r\nitself, or having three living buccinæ boiled in it, is of great natural\r\nefficacy. Pain from viscid and thick humours you may judge of from the\r\nheaviness of head, or of the ear itself, and from the previous regimen.\r\nWhen it is without heaviness, this state alone of hearing indicates\r\na windy spirit that cannot get vent. In both these cases we must use\r\nremedies of a deobstruent and incisive nature, such as the aphronitrum\r\nwith vinegar and honey, and sheep’s gall with common oil, or the oil of\r\nalmonds, and the tepid juice of leeks and onions with honey; or triturate\r\ncommon marjoram with honey and a woman’s milk, and inject it. For\r\nstronger coldness inject goat’s gall with the juice of leeks; and when\r\nthe pain is great and of long duration, and when difficulty of hearing is\r\npresent, we must use these remedies, namely, the juice of dragon-herb, of\r\nwake-robin, and of bryony, and the like. When the pain is occasioned by a\r\nwindy spirit, it may be greatly remedied by applying a cupping-instrument\r\npreviously heated in hot water, and affixed near the ear. But if there\r\nbe heaviness, distension, and heat, with a pulsatory pain or fever, you\r\nmay be sure that the ear is inflamed; and you must, in the first place,\r\nhave recourse to phlebotomy, then foment frequently with hot sweet oil\r\nby means of the ear specillum wrapped in wool. We must also inject into\r\nthe ear the fat of a goose or of a fox, or the ointment basilicon, with\r\nthe oil of roses, of privet, or of iris, and apply externally cataplasms\r\nof a paregoric and digestive nature; but when the pain compels us we may\r\nuse those things which are moderately narcotic, for there is no little\r\ndanger, owing to the nearness of the brain to the inflamed auditory\r\nnerve. The following is an excellent paregoric: Of opium, p. j; of\r\ncastor, p. ij. Inject it warm with a woman’s milk, or the white of an\r\negg, or tepid sweet wine. And the trochisk of saffron, that called aster,\r\nand the antidote of Philo is often of service to them. You must foment\r\nfrequently, either with common oil or some of the hot fomentations,\r\nand apply to the ear wool steeped in it, taking care not to touch the\r\ninflamed part. When the pain continues and an abscess is about to form,\r\nuse the remedy from the juice of linseed, injecting it softened with oil\r\nof roses or of chamomile. When the pain is occasioned by poisonous water\r\nwhich has got into the foramen of the ear, and if it be in considerable\r\nquantity it will be necessary to suck it out either with the mouth or\r\nby a reed; but if in small quantity, it may be wiped away with the ear\r\nspecillum wrapped in wool; and then some of the attenuant oils may be\r\ninjected, or else rose-oil, or the white of an egg, or a woman’s milk.\r\nEverything applied to the ear should be moderately warm.\r\n\r\n_For ulcers with inflammation._ Triturate equal parts of lycium\r\n(_catechu?_) and meconium with honey, and inject.\r\n\r\n_For severe pain, pus, and difficulty of hearing._ Of whitened\r\nalmonds, xx in number; of aphronitrum, dr. iij; of opium, dr. iij; of\r\nfrankincense, dr. iij; of saffron, dr. iv; of galbanum, dr. ij; of myrrh,\r\ndr. j; triturate with vinegar, and inject. When there is pain, dissolve\r\nit in oil of roses, and when there is a discharge of pus, in mulse or\r\noxymel, and when there is deafness, in vinegar. Recent ulcers are cured\r\nby horned poppy dissolved in vinegar, by the collyria from it, and by\r\nthose formed from roses, saffron, and myrrh, in like manner as running\r\nulcers without pain are cured by the recrement of iron triturated with\r\nvinegar during the heat of the dog-star.\r\n\r\n_To remove the hard sordes of the ears._ Dissolve nitre in vinegar, and\r\ninject with water, and having wiped it dry, inject nitre dissolved in\r\nvinegar with rose-oil.—_Another for sordes_: Mixing cardamom and a little\r\nnitre with dried figs freed from their stones, make collyria, which put\r\ninto the ear, and remove after three days. It brings away much sordes,\r\nand gives much relief. It also applies to fungous flesh, chronic pains,\r\nand ulcers. Or of aloes, of frankincense, of myrrh, of each, dr. j; of\r\nmisy, dr. iv. Make a trochisk of it with vinegar, and, when you are going\r\nto use, dissolve it in vinegar and rose-oil, and inject. In the same\r\nmanner the trochisks of Andron, Heré, and that of Musa may be used.\r\n\r\n_For chronic ulcers._ Mix gum juniper with honey, and anoint.—_Another_:\r\nBlow in misy what has been burnt and levigated. Before using those things\r\nwhich are injected into the ear, syringe it first with oxycrate in\r\noxymel, or in mulse, or in a decoction of some repellent article, such as\r\ndried lentil or roses.\r\n\r\n_For bloody ears._ Wash with the decoction of bog-rush, and inject the\r\njuice of knot-grass, with a little vinegar, or lycium, or lees of oil, or\r\nacacia, or the juice of leeks.\r\n\r\n_For fungous flesh._ Wash nitre in hot water, and use with equal parts of\r\nflakes of copper and sandarach. Clean the eschars which are formed by it\r\nwith honey.\r\n\r\n_For vermes in the ears._ Wash with a decoction of wormwood, of centaury,\r\nor of leeks; inject the juice of the green leaves, or of the fruit of\r\ncapers, or cedar-gum, or old human urine, or white hellebore with honey,\r\nor the juice of calamint, or scammony with vinegar, or the juice of\r\nwormwood. Oil poured into the opening of the ear, so as to make them\r\nascend to the top, answers well. But a better application is vinegar and\r\noil. It also applies to animalcules which fall into the ear.\r\n\r\n_For calculi and the like which have fallen into the ear._ Having wrapped\r\nsome wool about an ear specillum, dip it into turpentine-rosin, gum, or\r\nsome glutinous substance, and thus draw it out; but if it does not yield,\r\npour frequently warm oil into the passage; and if it do not fall out or\r\nis left behind, use the other means to be described in the Surgical part\r\nof this work.\r\n\r\n_On noises._ If noises occur in fevers at their crisis, they ought not\r\nto be interfered with, for they will commonly cease of themselves; but,\r\nif they remain after the disease, having fomented with the decoction\r\nof wormwood, inject vinegar and rose-oil, or the juice of radish with\r\nrose-oil, or that of black hellebore with vinegar. For chronic noises\r\noccasioned by thick and viscid humours (which you may know from their\r\ncoming on not suddenly, but gradually), syringe with vinegar, nitre,\r\nand honey.—_Another_: Of white hellebore, dr. ij; of castor, dr. ij; of\r\nsaffron, dr. iij; of nitre, dr. xvj. Make trochisks, which triturate in\r\nvinegar, and use.\r\n\r\n_For chronic noises and hissing sounds._ Triturate euphorbium with oil of\r\nprivet, heat and use. When, from increased sensibility, they experience\r\nthe sensation of vapours or spirits carried upwards, triturate castor and\r\nthe seed of hemlock with vinegar, and inject.\r\n\r\n_On difficulty of hearing and deafness._ Those cases which are\r\ncongenital, or which, although not congenital, are inveterate, and\r\nattended with complete deafness, are incurable; and those which, although\r\nnot complete, are inveterate, prove also incurable, or difficult to cure.\r\nThose which are formed by a bilious humour ascending upwards, you may\r\neasily cure by evacuating with cholagogue medicines; and sometimes the\r\ncomplaint goes off spontaneously, when bile is discharged downwards.\r\nDeafness, or difficulty of hearing, occasioned by crude and thick\r\nhumours, you may cure by opening a vein, by purging freely with hiera,\r\nand by using masticatories, errhines, and natural or salt baths. It is\r\nalso proper to inject into the ear those things which are recommended\r\nabove for noises. But the following are particularly applicable: Inject\r\nthe urine of a goat and the gall of a goat together, or the gall singly;\r\nor the juice of rue with honey; or castor with the oil of dill; or the\r\nmedicine œsypum with nard ointment; or the gall of a goat with galbanum;\r\nor this: Of castor, dr. ij; of nitre and white hellebore, of each, dr. j.\r\n\r\n_For contusions of the ears._ Hippocrates recommends us to apply nothing\r\nto them; but since we are often compelled by those who have sustained the\r\ninjuries to do something, we may use the following: Of myrrh, of aloes,\r\nof frankincense, of acacia, equal parts; anoint with vinegar or the\r\nwhite of an egg. Or, pound in a mortar the inner part of warm bread with\r\nhoney, and apply as a cataplasm. Or this: Of bitumen, of frankincense,\r\nof aloes, of the flesh of snails, of African bulbi, equal parts,\r\ntriturate with vinegar, and apply. When there is inflammation, triturate\r\nwith oily grain (_sesame_), or with chondrus boiled in vinegar, and apply\r\nas a cataplasm; but let the cataplasm be light, and not bandaged at\r\nall, or but slightly; and let wool dipped in oil be introduced into the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n_On parotis._ Parotis is an affection of the glands about the ears,\r\nbeing sometimes occasioned by humours from the head which are impacted\r\nin it, and sometimes by those collected from the rest of the body during\r\nthe crisis of a fever. If it be deep-seated, and do not occasion a\r\nswelling, we may assist nature by applying attractive remedies, either\r\nby putting on a cupping-instrument or using frequent fomentations. For\r\nif the matter be determined inwardly, there is no ordinary danger; but,\r\nif it inflame and swell out to a tumour, we must, on the contrary, use\r\nsoothing and digestive cataplasms, such as that from barley-flour, that\r\nfrom wheat, or from the flour of linseed with honied water, or boiled\r\nwith the decoction of fenugreek, or of marshmallows, or of chamomile, and\r\nthat from dock and axunge without salt. But if it appear that there is a\r\nfulness of blood, we must first evacuate by phlebotomy, if the strength\r\npermit: but if the swelling be not dissipated, we must use suppurative\r\nmedicines, such as wheat-flour, with the decoction of dried figs and\r\noil, and the application made from pollen and that from leaven. When the\r\naposteme is converted into pus, we may evacuate it either by opening it,\r\nor produce its rupture by means of an acrid medicine, such as that called\r\nsmilium, or that from garlic. The milder kinds of parotis are discussed\r\nby a fomentation of salt water, or the composition from Aperanus. This\r\nmedicine is calculated to discuss the converted pus, and to prove very\r\nanodyne. For inveterate cases of parotis, we may apply the ashes of burnt\r\nbuccinæ, or purpuræ, with honey or axunge, or figs boiled in sea water,\r\nor horehound with salts. Hard ones are softened by the composition of\r\nMnasæus, and that of Ariobarzan; but one of the best applications is\r\nthat formed from the juice of linseed. But before using these, we are to\r\napply cataplasms of ammoniac, mixing with them liquid pitch, bull’s fat,\r\nbdellium, storax, or hart’s marrow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The following ancient authors treat of diseases of the ear:\r\nHippocrates (de Affectionibus, et alibi); Galen (Sec. Loc. iii); Celsus\r\n(vi, 7); Oribasius (de Loc. Aff. iv); Aëtius (vi, 74 et seq.); Alexander\r\n(iii); Scribonius Largus; Marcellus (de Med. 9); Nonnus (74 et seq.);\r\nCælius Aurelianus (de Tard. Pass. ii, 3); Actuarius (Meth. Med. iv, 10);\r\nPliny (Hist. Nat. xxviii, 48); Octavius Horatianus (i, 7); Mesue (de Ægr.\r\nAurium); Avenzoar (i, 4); Serapion (2); Avicenna (i, iii, 4); Albucasis\r\n(ii); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix, 14; Pract. v, 62); Alsaharavius (Pract.\r\niii); Phases (ad Mansor. ix; Contin. iii.)\r\n\r\nFor relieving earach Hippocrates recommends the warm bath and\r\nfomentations; and when these do not succeed, phlegmagogues and\r\nmasticatories are to be used.\r\n\r\nCelsus gives very judicious directions for curing pain of the ears, but\r\nhis treatment is little different from our author’s. When the pain is\r\nnot violent he recommends abstinence alone; but if severe, venesection,\r\npurging, hot cataplasms from linseed and fenugreek, or sponges squeezed\r\nout of hot water. When the inflammation is particularly violent, poppies\r\nare to be added to the injections, which must be tepid; and when the\r\near is filled with them, soft wool is to be put over it to contain the\r\ninjection. He mentions various compound applications, which contain\r\npoppies, castor, myrrh, alum, saffron, and the like.\r\n\r\nOur author copies from Galen. He recommends the following simple\r\napplication: Having scooped out the heart of an onion, fill it with\r\noil, and having heated it in ashes, put it into the ear. He gives\r\nprescriptions for various injections and other compositions, which are\r\nsimilar to those of our author and Celsus.\r\n\r\nAëtius on this head is more brief and less distinct than our author.\r\n\r\nAlexander, Actuarius, and Octavius Horatianus treat of these complaints\r\nvery properly, but not differently from Celsus and our author. Alexander\r\nstates correctly that inflammation within the ear sometimes spreads\r\nto the brain, and proves fatal. He enjoins caution in using opiate\r\napplications to the ear, as he has seen dangerous effects from them by\r\ntheir inducing stupor. He particularly approves of introducing steam\r\ninto the ear, by means of a tube connected with a vessel containing some\r\nboiling decoction.\r\n\r\nMarcellus gives a long list of empirical applications, from which,\r\nperhaps, something valuable might be extracted. He recommends, like\r\nsome of the other authorities, a solution of alum in hot vinegar, with\r\nsome honey. We shall see in the twenty-sixth Section that alum was much\r\nused for allaying the pains of toothach. Among the ingredients in his\r\ninjections we remark tepid milk, opium, castor, spikenard, saffron,\r\nopobalsam, millepedes, &c.\r\n\r\nThe treatment directed by the Methodist Cælius Aurelianus is little\r\ndifferent from that of the other sects. He approves of putting tepid\r\noil into the ear; of stuffing it with wool; of using fomentations,\r\ncataplasms, leeches, and scarifications; and when the disease becomes\r\nchronic, of shaving the head, and applying acopa, dropaces, malagmata,\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\nSerapion and Rhases treat the complaint exactly like our author.\r\n\r\nAvenzoar relates a case of inflammation seated in the meatus, which he\r\ncured by filling it with oil of eggs. He further recommends bleeding\r\nand the other remedies already mentioned. Avicenna treats of diseases\r\nof the ear most minutely and scientifically, but at too great length\r\nfor us to do justice to his account of them. For pains from a hot cause\r\nhe recommends camphor-oil, or oil of violets with camphor. Mesue also\r\ntreats of these complaints very minutely. When the pain is violent, he\r\nrecommends injections containing poppies, henbane, mandrake, nightshade,\r\nand the like. Haly Abbas, in such cases, also approves of rose-oil, with\r\nopium, the juice of mandrake, &c. Alsaharavius varies his treatment\r\naccording to the nature of the exciting cause. When it is caused by\r\ncongestion of blood in the organ, he recommends bleeding, abstinence\r\nfrom wine, a restricted diet, and pouring warm oil into the ear. When it\r\narises from a cold cause he approves of oil of costus, of spikenard, &c.,\r\nand of applying to the ear a cataplasm of hot flour.\r\n\r\n_On ulcers of the ears._ Aëtius and Alexander give various prescriptions\r\nfor these cases. The fullest account, however, is contained in Galen\r\n(sec. loc.) When there is a discharge of pus, attended with pain,\r\nOctavius recommends alum, mixed with honey and oil. When ulcers of the\r\nears are recent, Mesue recommends injections of honied water, wine and\r\nhoney, vinegar and honey, or the like, by a syringe. They are to be\r\ndried by means of olibanum, or sarcocolla dissolved in wine. He also\r\npraises myrrh, aloes, alum, and red arsenic, as ingredients in the\r\napplications to ulcers of the ears. When the ulcers are chronic, they are\r\nfirst to be cleansed by such applications as the decoction of wormwood\r\nin wine, or oxymel of squills, with a small quantity of the flowers of\r\ncopper; then they are to be dressed with the usual incarnants; and,\r\nlastly, they are to be dried or cicatrized by compositions containing\r\naloes, myrrh, and frankincense. When the ulcers are foul, he and Serapion\r\nrecommend escharotics, such as the scoria æris. Haly’s applications are\r\nquite similar. For sanious discharge he recommends us to wipe the ear\r\nwith a piece of cloth wrapped round a probe, and dipped in an astringent\r\nsolution. He directs us to remove fungous flesh by an operation, or with\r\nthe ointment of flos æris. In this case Celsus recommends applications,\r\nconsisting of verdigris and honey, or frankincense, or squama aris\r\ntriturated with red arsenic. These powerful ingredients enter into some\r\nof the compositions recommended by Rhases.\r\n\r\n_For vermes in the ear._ All the ancient authorities in this case\r\nrecommend acrid and bitter injections. Wormwood, hellebore, nitre,\r\ncalamint, birthwort, and sulphur are the common ingredients in the\r\ncompositions recommended by Galen, Alexander, Aëtius, Oribasius, Celsus,\r\nMesue, Serapion, Haly Abbas, Alsaharavius, and Rhases.\r\n\r\n_On calculi and the like which have fallen into the ear._ Alexander,\r\nAëtius, and Haly Abbas recommend similar means, and also direct us to\r\ncompress the patient’s nose and mouth, and to make him sneeze. Galen,\r\ncopying from Archigenes, gives similar directions. This subject is more\r\nfully treated of in the Sixth Book.\r\n\r\n_On noises._ These are fully treated of by Galen. (Sec. loc.) He remarks\r\nthat they commonly arise from indigestion, excess of wine, violent\r\nvomiting, or the improper application of medicines to the ear. He says\r\nthe disease sometimes arises from excessive sensibility, in which case he\r\nmixes with the injections the juice of mandragora, poppies, or the like.\r\nOur author’s applications are taken from Alexander. Celsus treats of this\r\naffection very circumstantially, and modifies his application according\r\nto the circumstances of the case. He recommends particular attention to\r\nthe diet, and injections, such as castor with vinegar, oil of iris,\r\nor oil of bays, or myrrh and nitre, with roses and vinegar. When local\r\napplications do not succeed, Haly states that the disease is occasioned\r\nby an affection of the brain or auditory nerve. Alsaharavius treats of\r\nthe complaint with singular precision and at great length. (Pract. iii,\r\n4.)\r\n\r\n_On deafness._ On this subject Galen gives copious extracts from\r\nApollonius and Archigenes, from which the aurists of the present day\r\nmight derive perhaps some information. In deafness occurring suddenly he\r\nrecommends fomentations with the decoction of wormwood. Aëtius copies\r\nfrom him. Alexander is very particular about the general treatment,\r\nrecommending emetics of hellebore, drastic purgatives, errhines, topical\r\napplications, exercise on horseback, change of place, shaving the head,\r\nand applying leeches to it, or a sinapism, or using friction, and even\r\nopening the arteries. Celsus directs us to examine the meatus, and if any\r\nscab of a sore or sordes appear in it, to inject warm oil, ærugo with\r\nhoney, or the like; and afterwards to syringe it with tepid water. When\r\nthe sordes is hard, it may be first softened by an injection of vinegar\r\nwith a little nitre. Haly Abbas directs us to mix mustard with figs, and\r\napply upon a tent for three days. As an injection he recommends castor\r\ndissolved in oil of dill, and the juice of rue. When it proceeds from\r\nbile, he recommends hot purgatives and things of an attenuant nature.\r\nAccording to the nature of the exciting cause, Alsaharavius applies\r\nvarious remedies, such as purging, gargles, fumigations with decoctions\r\nof stimulant herbs, detergent oils, such as those of dill, chamomile, &c.\r\n\r\nAaron, one of the authorities quoted by Rhases, states that deafness\r\nsometimes arises from congestion of blood about the ear; and, in that\r\ncase, recommends local bleeding and an attenuant diet, with fomentations\r\nof hot oils, and the like. When it arises from obstruction, he directs\r\nthe use of injections containing hellebore, vinegar of squills, &c.\r\n\r\n_For contusions of the ears._ Galen gives various prescriptions for this\r\ncase. Similar ones occur in Aëtius and Oribasius. Modern aurists forbid\r\nto bandage the ears tightly.\r\n\r\n_On parotis._ Celsus properly directs that if the gland swell without any\r\nother disease, applications to produce resolution should be first tried;\r\nbut if the system is labouring under disease, that the swelling is to be\r\nbrought to a suppuration, and opened as soon as possible. It is from\r\nGalen, however, that all the subsequent authorities copy their account\r\nof parotis. He lays it down as an established rule of practice that no\r\nattempt is to be made to discuss the swelling by repellent applications,\r\nbut that suppuration is to be encouraged by the proper means. When\r\nthere is plethora of blood, he allows venesection; and, when attended\r\nwith pain, he recommends paregoric cataplasms of linseed, fenugreek,\r\nchamomile, and the like. When any hardness remains, he prescribes some\r\nof the malagmata, or emollient plasters. He informs us that Archigenes\r\napplied figs boiled and pounded. Octavius Horatianus and some of the\r\nothers mention this application. Of the subsequent authors, although\r\nthey contain little additional information, Alexander may be referred to\r\nas one who has treated of the complaint very fully and judiciously. He\r\nrecommends bleeding before having recourse to topical applications.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians adopt the views of the Greeks. Alsaharavius directs the use\r\nof diachylon plaster as a maturative application. When the inflammation\r\nruns high he approves of bleeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXIV.—ON THE AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE, AND OF THE SENSE OF SMELL.\r\n\r\nWhen the faculty of smell is impaired, but the speech remains\r\nuninjured, it is to be suspected that the anterior cavities of the\r\nbrain are affected, being impaired either by a simple intemperament,\r\nor a collection of noxious humours. But if the voice be at the same\r\ntime impaired, and have become thick, it is to be conjectured that the\r\naffection proceeds from certain noxious humours obstructing the ethmoid\r\nbones. Having ascertained the intemperament of the brain from the\r\nsymptoms often mentioned, use the opposite remedies. Evacuate the humours\r\nby masticatories, and more particularly by powerful errhines; but apply\r\nattenuant aromatics as for catarrh. But if you suspect a plethora of the\r\nwhole body, in the first place evacuate it by venesection, or by purging\r\nwith hiera. Do so likewise for polypus and ozæna. Then use the topical\r\napplications. Theriac also is drunk with great advantage. Polypus is a\r\npreternatural tumour formed in the nose, resembling the flesh of the\r\npolypus. The sarcoma is a substance of the same kind; but ozæna is a\r\nputrid ulcer formed by a defluxion of acrid humours.\r\n\r\n_For polypus and sarcoma._ Of the flakes of copper, dr. viij; of\r\ncopperas, dr. vj; of sandarach, dr. iv; of black hellebore, dr. ij. Blow\r\nin, and use confidently, as being an excellent remedy; for in thirteen\r\ndays it will prove of manifest service. Copperas alone with vinegar is of\r\nuse.—_Another_: Of the rind of pomegranate, dr. xij; of copperas, dr. x;\r\nof chalcitis, dr. viij; of bull’s gall, of amomum, of myrrh, of calamint,\r\nof horehound, of each, dr. iv; of saffron, dr. ij; of white hellebore,\r\ndr. iv. Use in a powder.—_Another_: Touch with levigated diphryges (_husk\r\nof brass?_), and distend the nostrils with the pledget from lamp-wicks.\r\n\r\n_For ozæna._ Of misy, chalcitis, and myrrh, of each, dr. vij; of\r\ncopperas, dr. vj; of fissile alum, of galls, and of the flakes of copper,\r\nof each, dr. iv; of round alum, dr. ij; of frankincense, dr. j; of\r\nvinegar, one sextarius. Boil the whole in a vessel of copper, and when\r\nof the consistence of honey, use upon tents.—_Another_: Of verdigris and\r\nflakes of copper, equal parts. Use in a dry state.\r\n\r\n_For fetid smells of the nose._ Of myrrh, of acacia, and of amomum, of\r\neach, dr. j; mix with boiled honey, and direct that it be glued to the\r\nextremity of the septum narium.—_Another_: Of amomum, of myrrh, of dried\r\nroses, equal parts; mix with nard ointment, and anoint with it. The\r\nmalagma of hedychroum with wine produces the same effects.\r\n\r\n_For ulcers in the nose._ Of whitelead, lb. j; of litharge, oz. iij; or\r\nof the dross of lead, oz. iij; of burnt lead, (see that all be washed);\r\nmix with wine and myrtle oil.\r\n\r\n_For those ulcers called sweet._ Of litharge, dr. iv; of fresh rue, dr.\r\niv; of fissile alum, dr. ij; mix with myrtle oil and vinegar.\r\n\r\n_Sternutatories._ White hellebore, castor, pepper, fuller’s herb,\r\neither alone or together. They must not be blown in, but applied with a\r\nfeather or the end of a finger to the innermost parts of the nose. If\r\nthe sneezing continue too long from the use of the medicine, it may be\r\nappeased by injecting into the nostrils some nard, or rose-oil, or sweet\r\noil. Sweet-scented things, likewise, appease sneezing, as anise, and the\r\npounded chaff of basil. In all these cases the head must be dried by\r\ndetergent ointments (_smegmata_) of nitre and pumice-stone, or we may\r\nuse that which is called Æsculapium, and the soap of Constantine, the\r\nCappadocian salts, and the like.\r\n\r\n_For hemorrhage from the nose._ Of bleeding from the nose in fevers we\r\nhave treated in the Second Book; but we shall now treat of it when it\r\narises from any other cause, and is difficult to restrain. Triturate\r\nchalcitis, and apply upon the tent formed from lamp-wicks, or the one\r\ncalled priapiscus, soaked in water, and press it into the nostrils; or\r\nburn an eggshell, and add to it of galls one half; or touch it with\r\nIndian lycium, or blow in the ashes of burnt ass-dung, or press out\r\nthe juices from it, and inject into the nose; or let the person smell\r\nto the vapour of lapis molaris heated and plunged into vinegar; or use\r\nthe following obstruent preparation: Of the manna of the frankincense\r\ntree, p. j; of aloes, p. ss; mix with the white of an egg, and use,\r\nby means of a tent made of lamp-wicks, having added externally to it\r\nthe down of a hare; or apply to the nostril the preparation called\r\nLysimachium; or apply for a length of time a large dry cupping-instrument\r\nto the hypochondrium of the side from which the blood flows; or stuff\r\nthe ear firmly; or apply sponges out of cold water to the forehead; or\r\napply a cupping-instrument with scarifications so as to detract blood;\r\nand sometimes it will be proper to let blood from a vein, if this be\r\nnot contra-indicated; and to apply ligatures to the extremities, more\r\nespecially the arms and thighs, as if for venesection. Direct motion\r\nto be made with them, exerting the hands by rubbing, and the feet by\r\nwalking; for when the veins there are filled with blood, the parts\r\nabout the nose will have a smaller supply of it. But a sponge soaked in\r\ncold oxycrate and bound externally to the bleeding nostril will often\r\naccomplish the purpose. It is best, however, to stuff the nose first with\r\na long tent in the form of a wedge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Consult Hippocrates (de Affect. et alibi); Galen (de Med.\r\nsec. loc. iii); Celsus (vi, 8); Cælius Aurelianus (de Mor. Tard. ii,\r\n1); Oribasius (Loc. Aff. iv, 45); Alexander (iii, 8); Aëtius (vi, 90);\r\nActuarius (Meth. Med. iv, 12); Nonnus (92); Scribonius Largus; Marcellus\r\n(de Med. 10); Octavius Horatianus (i, 11); Serapion (ii); Mesue (de Ægr.\r\nNarium); Avicenna (iii, 4); Albucasis (ii, 24); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix,\r\n15; Pract. v, 68); Avenzoar (i, 5); Alsaharavius (Pract. ii); Rhases (ad\r\nMansor. iv, 45; Divis. 40; Contin. iv.)\r\n\r\n_Of polypus._ Hippocrates describes five species of polypus. The first\r\nis represented to be like a piece of torn flesh hanging in the nostril,\r\nand is to be extracted. The second consists of hard flesh which fills\r\nthe nostril, and is to be treated by the cautery, with the application\r\nafterwards of the flos æris to the part. The third is a round and soft\r\npiece of flesh growing from the cartilage, and is to be extracted by\r\na ligature, which operation he describes minutely. The fourth is of a\r\nstony hardness, and is to be cut all round with a scalpel, then burnt,\r\nand the part touched with flos æris. The fifth grows from the top of the\r\ncartilage, and is to be burnt.\r\n\r\nGalen gives various prescriptions from Archigenes, Asclepiades, Lampon,\r\nand others, for removing polypus. The most active ingredients in them\r\nare copperas, burnt copper, verdigris, alum, chalcitis, and arsenic. One\r\nof the simplest of Galen’s prescriptions consists of arsenic, quicklime,\r\nand white hellebore, which are to be triturated together and applied.\r\nAnother, named from Antonius Musa, is a powder consisting of equal\r\nparts of arsenic and copperas. We can from experience speak of the good\r\neffects of a similar application; and would, therefore, wish to call the\r\nattention of the profession to this method of curing polypus. That it\r\nmay prove dangerous if misapplied cannot be doubted, but in the hands\r\nof a cautious surgeon such an application will be found both safe and\r\neffectual.\r\n\r\nCelsus forbids us to meddle with the disease when it is of a cancerous\r\nnature. But when soft it is to be cured by an operation. He adds that\r\nit may sometimes be made to drop off, if touched by means of a tent or\r\npencil with the following composition: ‘Minii Sinopici, chalcitidis,\r\ncalcis, sandarachæ, singulorum, p. j; atramenti sutorii, p. ij.’ We need\r\nscarcely say that all these ingredients are powerfully caustic.\r\n\r\nScribonius gives prescriptions similar to those of Galen.\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus says he has seen the tumour drop off after such\r\napplications as arsenic with honey have been used.\r\n\r\nAëtius gives prescriptions for removing polypus without incision or\r\nburning. One of the most simple of his compositions is a powder composed\r\nof alum, ginger, red arsenic, burnt copper, and galls.\r\n\r\nAlexander, like the others, recommends escharotics, such as misy,\r\ncopperas, and chalcitis. Marcellus makes mention of the same.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians imitate the practice of the Greeks. Serapion gives a\r\nprescription containing arsenic, copperas, black hellebore, &c. Avicenna\r\ndescribes the treatment by ligature, extraction, burning, and septic\r\napplications. He prefers the operation. Mesue treats with great precision\r\nof the different modes of cure. When the tumour is not large it may be\r\nremoved, he says, by septic applications. His prescriptions contain\r\narsenic, alum, flos æris, &c. Haly says that when a polypus is hard and\r\ncancerous it is incurable, but when soft, it may be removed by applying\r\nseptic substances, such as flos æris, arsenic, and the like. Alsaharavius\r\ndescribes the two species of polypus, the cancerous and the fleshy. For\r\nthe latter, besides the operation, he recommends us to introduce a thread\r\nsmeared with the Egyptian and green ointments. Several of the authorities\r\nquoted by Rhases approve of the septic applications prepared with\r\narsenic, vitriol, oil of oleander, alum, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe ancient method of removing polypus with septics is mentioned by Guy\r\nof Cauliac, and other surgical writers of that age.\r\n\r\n_For ozæna_ Celsus recommends stimulant and escharotic applications\r\ncontaining copperas, lees of oil, turpentine-rosin, squills, &c. They are\r\nto be applied by means of a specillum or probe wrapped round with wool.\r\n\r\nThe prescriptions given by Galen from Archigenes and Asclepiades contain\r\nmisy, chalcitis, burnt copper, orpiment, red arsenic, alum, red nitre,\r\nmyrrh, saffron, &c. The other Greek authors do but copy from him on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAvicenna recommends such aromatics as amomum, cloves, and roses, with\r\ncamphor, hellebore, and the like. Haly makes no mention of escharotics,\r\nbut recommends aromatics, such as marjoram, cloves, amomum, myrrh,\r\nand such like substances. He directs us to purge with hiera, and to\r\ngargle with mustard. The substances which enter into the compositions\r\nof Alsaharavius are very similar to this. The ingredients in Rhases’\r\napplications are mostly desiccants and aromatics; but a few of them\r\ncontain escharotics, such as vitriol and red arsenic.\r\n\r\n_On ulcers._ Galen’s prescriptions contain burnt lead, burnt antimony,\r\nceruse, litharge, and the like. Avicenna and Rhases praise the powder of\r\nRuffus, which contains alum, galls, cyperus, myrrh, saffron, and arsenic.\r\nFor the sweet ulcers Avicenna recommends the same applications as our\r\nauthor. Those of Haly are nowise different.\r\n\r\n_Sternutatories._ Similar lists of substances for exciting and appeasing\r\nsneezing are given by Aëtius, Nonnus, Avicenna, and others.\r\n\r\n_On bleeding at the nose._ Most of the remedies mentioned in this Section\r\nare taken from Galen (sec. loc. and Meth. Med.) Aëtius repeats his\r\ndirections (vi, 94.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna has surpassed every other author in the accuracy with which\r\nhe details the phenomena and treatment of epistaxis; but his account\r\nis too long for us to do justice to it. His local applications consist\r\nof styptics, incrassants, and caustics. He very properly inculcates\r\nthe propriety of producing revulsion and evacuating the general system\r\nby bleeding at the arm, which, he says, should be carried the length\r\nof producing deliquium animi. He directs us to apply ligatures to the\r\ntesticles and extremities, to place the patient in water cooled with ice,\r\nand to pour the same upon his head. He says a man will lose from twenty\r\nto twenty-five pounds of blood before he dies. Haly’s treatment agrees\r\nin most respects with that of Avicenna. He directs us to pour water upon\r\nthe head, to apply to the forehead a plaster of galls, roses, &c., or\r\na piece of cloth soaked in the infusion of roses cooled with snow and\r\nvinegar. He also makes mention of general bleeding, and the application\r\nof a cupping-instrument to the nape of the neck. Alsaharavius cautions\r\nus not to stop a critical epistaxis. Like Haly, he recommends us, as a\r\ngeneral practice, to bleed from the arm if the strength be good, to apply\r\na cupping-instrument to produce revulsion, to pour cold water upon the\r\nhead, and to snuff up the nostrils water impregnated with the virtues of\r\nsuch astringents as galls, alum, camphor, roses, &c. One of the styptic\r\npowders recommended by Rhases contains quicklime, vitriol, galls, and red\r\narsenic. He also directs snow to be applied to the head. In extreme cases\r\nhe approves of the cautery.\r\n\r\nRespecting the manna thuris, mentioned in this Section, see Bernard’s\r\nNonnus (96.) Dale thus explains it: “Manna thuris, offic. sunt micæ,\r\nfragmenta, pollen, et farina thuris, quæ ex collisione, dum in saccis\r\nvehitur, colliguntur. Alii autem per mannam thuris grana ejusdem\r\nintelligunt.” (Pharmacol. 381.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT.

Dissolve them all in a\r\ndecoction of bruised ichthyocolla, make trochisks, and use.—_Another_: Of\r\nivory shavings, dr. viij; of male frankincense, of ichthyocolla, the same\r\nquantity. Use as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n_For darkness of the face._ Of iris, of ptisan, of bruised beans, of each\r\na sextarius and a half; of sal ammoniac, of burnt hartshorn, of ammoniac\r\nperfume, of each, oz. ij. Dissolve in water, and make trochisks, and\r\nhaving again triturated with water, anoint before bathing.—_Another_: Of\r\nptisan, of tares, of frankincense, of bruised beans, of Illyrian iris,\r\nof aphronitum, of costus, of each, the fourth part of a chœnix; bitter\r\nalmonds, xx in number; form with the white of an egg and the milk of an\r\nass, and use as aforesaid. The trochisk peponatus also answers well.\r\n\r\n_For freckles and lentigo._ Of toasted Cimolian earth, half a hemina;\r\nof toasted aphronitum, dr. viij; of the flour of tares, dr. iv; of the\r\nrefuse of bull’s gall, dr. viij. Triturate and use.—_Another_: Of the\r\nlees of wine, dr. x; of the flour of tares, dr. x; of bruised beans, dr.\r\nx; of white hellebore, dr. v; of aphronitrum, dr. x; of alcyonium, dr. x.\r\nTriturate, and rub with it.\r\n\r\n_For bruised spots, or hypopia._ First foment with the decoction of\r\nfenugreek, and afterwards with that of melilot, mix the collyrium of\r\nNilus from roses with water, and anoint; then use the myrrh collyrium.\r\nIf these do not produce the effect, anoint with the collyrium of burnt\r\nsandyx; or apply hyssop with water; or bind hyssop into a piece of rag,\r\ndip it in warm water, and foment; or foment with strong salt water, and\r\nrub down the skin of radish with honey, and apply. This answers also for\r\nchronic cases. For chronic spots and lividity, take of Cretan hartwort,\r\ntwo parts; of Samian earth, one part; apply with honey, taking care\r\nthat it do not produce an ulcer.—_Another abstergent application_: Of\r\nhyssop, of thapsia, and of cassia, of each, dr. ij; of wax, dr. ij; of\r\nturpentine, dr. j. Apply, taking care that it do not occasion an ulcer,\r\nand on that account removing it frequently.\r\n\r\n_For vari or warts._ They are small hard tumours about the face. Anoint,\r\nby rubbing with oxymel; or triturate litharge with turpentine and some\r\nwhite oil, and anoint by rubbing; or rub in fissile alum with turpentine;\r\nor triturate bitter almonds in vinegar, and rub. _For callous vari_:\r\nOf Gallic soap, dr. iv; of frankincense and ammoniac, of each, dr. j.\r\nDissolve in water, and anoint; after an hour, wash away.\r\n\r\n_For vari, hairs, and roughness of the face._ Of wax, dr. x; of\r\nturpentine, dr. j; of mistletoe, dr. ij; melt, adding a small quantity\r\nof oil, and scrub the face with it, for it takes out the hairs by the\r\nroots.—_Another_: Apply powdered poppy, or pennyroyal, with salt and\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\n_The cerate of Thais, for rendering the face ruddy._ Of saffron, of\r\nmadder-root, of fucus, of frankincense, of myrrh, of each, dr. ij; mix\r\nwith calf’s fat and mastich oil, and then anoint, and after a little\r\ninterval wash away with a sponge out of hot water. These applications for\r\nthe face will also answer for other parts of the body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Most of the authors referred to in the preceding Section may\r\nbe consulted on these complaints.\r\n\r\nThis Section is mostly copied from Oribasius (de Loc. Affect. iv), who,\r\nhowever, is greatly indebted to Galen (De Med. sec. loc. v.) Aëtius gives\r\na long list of compositions for these complaints of the face, and to it\r\nthe lovers of personal appearance are particularly referred. Celsus seems\r\nto have thought it necessary to make an apology for treating of these\r\ntrifling complaints: “Pæne ineptiæ sunt curare varos, et lenticulas,\r\net ephelidas; sed eripi tamen fæminis cura cultus sui non potest.” His\r\napplications are like those of our author. For vari he recommends equal\r\nparts of rosin, fissile alum, and some honey. Ephelis, he says, is\r\nremoved by rosin, with a third part of fossil salts, and a little honey.\r\n\r\nThe φάκος and ἐφηλίς are, we believe, the lentigo and maculæ of Haly\r\nAbbas. (Theor. viii, 18; Pract. iv, 15.) His remedies consist of bitter\r\nalmonds, mercury killed (sublimed?), mustard, with the oil of figs.\r\nThe ἴονθος is his morum. For it he recommends the flos æris and other\r\nstimulant applications. Alsaharavius speaks of the juice of the wild\r\ncucumber, the root of iris, pine-gum, and if these are not sufficient,\r\nvenesection. He treats minutely of these affections of the face. (Pract.\r\nvi.) The ἴονθος is the acne of Drs. Willan and Bateman. Galen says these\r\naffections are to be removed by emollient and discutient applications in\r\ngeneral. He treats very fully of hypopion or ecchymosis of the face. For\r\nit Alsaharavius recommends an application consisting of the infusion of\r\nradish and red arsenic. (Pract. iv, 4.) This must have been a powerful\r\nstimulant. Marcellus recommends to apply frequently a new sponge soaked\r\nin hot salt water. (De Medic. xix.)\r\n\r\nRhases describes this affection by the name of _pannus faciei_. Among\r\nthe ingredients of his compositions we remark fenugreek, ammoniac,\r\nfrankincense, liquid pitch, &c. Some of them contain arsenic. He also\r\nrecommends scarifications.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXVI.—ON AFFECTIONS OF THE MOUTH; AND, FIRST, OF THE TEETH.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are pained without inflammation of the gums, sometimes from\r\npain attacking the body of the teeth, and sometimes from the nerve\r\nwhich enters them being affected. Wherefore they require the strongest\r\nremedies; the greater part of which are prepared from the most acrid\r\nvinegar. When the gums are pained from inflammation, the best application\r\nis oil of lentisk retained in the mouth in a tepid state. But see that\r\nit is new; for the older it is so much the worse is it for this purpose.\r\nThis general rule ought to be observed, to evacuate first whatever humour\r\nprevails in the general system.\r\n\r\n_For inflammation of the teeth._ Wash with vinegar in which have been\r\nboiled galls, or the root of winter-cherry, or the seed or leaves of\r\nhenbane, or pennyroyal, or the juice of nightshade, or the root of\r\ncapers, or the leaves of myrtle, or poley, or the root of the wild\r\ncucumber, or the leaves of rue with oxymel, or hartshorn, or the vinegar\r\nof squills, or pellitory with hyssop. To the eaten part of the tooth\r\napply storax with opium, or galbanum, or sulphur vivum with lycium; or,\r\nlet the patient inhale the steam from the seed of henbane through a small\r\nfunnel. And the antidote of Philo, if applied round the tooth, removes\r\nthe pain. When there is a defluxion on the teeth, rinse with a decoction\r\nof myrtle, lentisk, and galls, or of Syrian sumach, or of the flowers of\r\nthe wild pomegranate, or of its rind. Sprinkle also of salts two parts;\r\nof burnt alum extinguished in vinegar and pulverized, one part; then wash\r\nwith wine. For bloody gums, sprinkle fine alum, or rinse with aloes in\r\nwine, or with the root of bramble boiled in wine, or Syriac sumach. When\r\nthe gums both bleed and are affected with a rheum, burn pickled tunny in\r\na pot until it be reduced to ashes, with which touch the parts. Loose\r\nteeth are fastened by being sprinkled with aloes, or Syriac sumach, or\r\nfissile alum, or galls, or the root of bramble, either by themselves or\r\nboiled in wine.—_Another_: Pulverize the bark of green nuts, and to the\r\nexpressed juice add Minnæan myrrh and fissile alum, and mix together, and\r\nuse, by pouring it into the mouth, and put upon the gums of the pained\r\ntooth, which it will cure.—_Another_: Triturate together garlic, pepper,\r\nand stavesacre; put into a linen cloth; make small balls of it, and\r\nchange frequently; by which means you will purge the humour in the head,\r\nand effect a cure of the teeth.\r\n\r\n_For loose teeth, running gums, and for every spreading ulcer in the\r\nmouth._ Of burnt chalcitis, dr. xij; of calamine, dr. viij; use in powder\r\nwith vinegar.\r\n\r\n_How to remove the teeth without pain._ Apply flour with the juice of\r\nspurge, and above it an ivy leaf, and leave it for an hour. They will\r\nspontaneously break in pieces.\r\n\r\n_A dentifrice, also for parulis, or gumboil._ Of that kind of alum called\r\nplinthitis, oz. iv; of sal ammoniac, oz. iv; of myrrh, of costus, of\r\npellitory, of each, dr. iv; of pepper, eighty grains.\r\n\r\n_For parulis._ Of sulphur vivum, of pepper, of fissile alum, equal\r\nparts. Parulis is an inflammation in a part of the gums, which, not\r\nbeing resolved, suppurates. Haring suppurated, and being divided with\r\na scalpel, it is to be kept separate with a tent. Epulis is a fleshy\r\nexcrescence from inflammation on the innermost dens molaris, being\r\nattended sometimes with fever and pain. It must be repressed; and,\r\ntherefore, we must use the species of verdigris called _xyston_, either\r\nby itself or with an equal part of galls, or burnt sori, or burnt alum,\r\nor galls alone, or the flakes of copper triturated with vinegar for a\r\nsufficient number of days and dried.\r\n\r\n_A dentifrice._ The burnt roots of birthwort, burnt hartshorn, with some\r\nmastich.—_Another_: White salts mixed with honey, and wrapped in the\r\nleaves of the fig-tree, and burnt until reduced to ashes.—_Another_:\r\nBuccinæ filled with salt and burnt; land snails burnt with honey;\r\nunwashed wool burnt with a little salts. With each of these, for the sake\r\nof fragrance, let there be mixed the schænanth, or spikenard, Indian leaf\r\n(_malabathrum_), or cyperus, or iris.\r\n\r\n_An application which will whiten the teeth, repress swelling of the\r\ngums, and produce fragrant breath._ Of pumice-stone, of roasted salts, of\r\niris, of each, dr. iv; of cyperus, dr. v; of spikenard, dr. j; of pepper,\r\ndr. vj; pulverize, and use.\r\n\r\n_For teeth set on edge._ Painful feeling in the teeth is relieved by\r\nchewing purslain, or by rubbing oil of unripe olives, or by lees of oil\r\nboiled in a copper vessel to the consistence of honey, and rubbed in\r\nafter being long kept.\r\n\r\n_For worn teeth._ For worn teeth, apply, of bay-berries, of fissile alum,\r\nof the climbing birthwort, equal parts.\r\n\r\n_For corroded gums._ Of the flowers of roses, dr. viij; of galls, dr. iv;\r\nof myrrh, dr. ij. Erosions and running from the gums are cured by washing\r\nwith asses’ milk, the decoction of olive leaves, or vinegar of squills;\r\nor by the following dry applications: the rust of iron, and flowers of\r\nthe cultivated pomegranate. For swelling and fungous flesh of the gums,\r\nthe juice of purslain retained in the mouth, the brine of pickled olives,\r\nwarm oil of unripe olives, or lentisk oil, or oil of apples, or lees\r\nof oil, are applicable; and the following powders: the rust of iron or\r\ncopper, the roots of birthwort, the seed of plantain, diphryges, calcined\r\ncopperas, pomegranate flowers.\r\n\r\n_For fissures of the lips._ Rub with boiled lees of oil. Or this: Of\r\ngeese fat, with honey and turpentine, equal parts; of the flowers of\r\nroses, of the sordes of unwashed wool, of rose-oil, a small quantity.\r\n\r\n_On the disease called ranula._ Ranula is an inflammatory swelling which\r\nforms below the tongue, particularly in children; wherefore rub the part\r\nwith equal parts of misy and scraped verdigris (_xyston_) in powder; and\r\nto the chin apply the plasters called _antherum_, _sphærium_, and the\r\n_parygrum_ from eggs. But, in adults, divide the veins below the tongue\r\nin the first place.—_Another_, (it answers likewise with aphthæ): Of\r\nscraped verdigris, of galls, of chalcitis, equal parts. With must it\r\nwill form a gargle.—_Another_: Having previously rubbed with the flour\r\nof tares and honey, anoint with galls triturated in honey, or with the\r\nflowers of roses in like manner, or rinse the mouth with a decoction of\r\nolive leaves.\r\n\r\n_For inflammation of the tonsils._ If the tonsils and uvula be inflamed\r\nin a fever, the most proper gargles are the decoctions of bran, or of\r\nroses, or of dates, or of Sebesten plums, or of dried lentil. When the\r\ninflammation is at its acme, or is on the decline, we may mix with\r\nthem some honey, which we must not do at the commencement, nor during\r\nits increase, lest, by its acrid nature, it attract a defluxion. If it\r\nsuppurate and burst, the patient must gargle with honied water, or with\r\nthe decoction of lentil, or of roses, persevering until it is completely\r\nresolved; or we may give him to gargle some of the mixtures for rinsing\r\nthe mouth. If pestilential ulcers in the tonsils take place, we may\r\nuse the afore-mentioned remedies, and particularly apply the gargle\r\nfrom mulberries with hot water, or hydromel, having the flowers of\r\nroses sprinkled upon it, or costus or sumach, either in powder, or in\r\na decoction; or a decoction of the dried leaves of horned poppy. It is\r\nbitter, and it answers best if you dissolve the juice, as we use it for\r\ncollyria, in honied water. It may also be used with advantage by blowing\r\nin the dry herb, or applying it upon the finger. Care must be taken not\r\nto touch it with the hand, or, at least, it should be very gently. The\r\ntrochisk of Andron is also of service. After the irritation from these\r\nthings is removed, they should use a gargle of liquorice, or that from\r\nScybelitic wine, and of saffron, and of Chian mastich, and of myrrh,\r\nand afterwards of starch and tragacanth. When the ulcer has stopped\r\nspreading, they may use a gargle of milk and Samian earth.—_Another, for\r\nantiades_: Pound sweet pomegranate along with its peel, and mix six parts\r\nof its expressed juice with one of honey, boil to the consistence of\r\nhoney, and anoint.—_Another_: Of immature galls, oz. ij; of fissile alum,\r\noz. j; of burnt sal ammoniac, oz. j; touch with it in powder.—_Another_:\r\nOf galls, dr. viij; of misy, dr. ij; of roasted salts, dr. v; use in\r\npowder. Antias is a scirrhous swelling of the tonsils.\r\n\r\n_On the uvula._ When the uvula is inflamed, we must use the gargles\r\nrecommended for inflammation of the tonsils, and those of a moderately\r\nastringent nature, such as the juice of pomegranate, applied by means\r\nof a small spoon, or the surgical instrument invented for the purpose;\r\nand these things may be applied either by themselves, or with moderately\r\nboiled honey, or the liquorice root may be mixed with the pomegranate\r\njuice. The juice of the liquorice root enveloped in honey also answers\r\nwell. The swelling may be repressed by the following substances:\r\nblood-stone, the Phrygian stone burnt, agerat, the composition from\r\nPhrygian stone used for complaints of the pudenda; also Samian earth,\r\nEretrian, Sinopic reddle, the Lemnian earth, the oil of unripe olives\r\nby itself, or with some of these; and the fruit of the Egyptian thorn,\r\nand fissile alum. The seed and leaves of roses act more mildly, but\r\nstill more so gum traganth, sarcocolla, and starch, which we must use,\r\nif pained when repressed by astringents. When the swelling is of equal\r\nthickness throughout, in which case we call the disease columella, we\r\nmust trust to the gargles prepared from myrrh, saffron, and cyperus,\r\nand avoid all pressure, and rather anoint with a feather. The following\r\ncomposition answers well: Of Syrian sumach, dr. viij; of saffron, dr. iv;\r\nof costus, dr. viij; of rose-seed dr. iv. It may also be applied to the\r\ngums. But a thread of a sea-purple colour which has been bound round the\r\nneck of a viper, and strangled her, has wonderful effects as an amulet in\r\nrelieving affections of the tonsils and neck, as Galen testifies.\r\n\r\n_For hemorrhages from the mouth._ Apply the pounded leaves of leeks; or,\r\ndip a new piece of sponge in raw pitch, burn, pulverize, and use. It is\r\nalso beneficial to rinse the mouth with a cold decoction of green or\r\ndried roses, that of vine tendrils, or of the leaves of lentisk, or of\r\nbramble, or of quinces, or of roses, or of grape-stones, or of lentils.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. All the authors referred to in the twenty-third section may\r\nbe consulted.\r\n\r\n_On the teeth._ Galen, in particular, deserves to be consulted on\r\ndiseases of the teeth, which he has treated of very fully in the\r\nfifth book of his work ‘De Med. sec. loc.’ He very properly combats\r\nthe opinion, which we still sometimes hear maintained, that the teeth\r\nthemselves are devoid of sensibility. He states that, once having\r\ntoothach, he felt his tooth not only painful but throbbing. One of the\r\nbest of our modern writers on the teeth, Eustachius, justly remarks that\r\nthe teeth have a nerve of considerable magnitude distributed upon them,\r\nand are in fact possessed of exquisite sensibility. When the teeth ach,\r\nGalen says the strongest medicines are indicated, in order to repel and\r\ndiscuss the exciting cause. Most of these are to be prepared with acrid\r\nvinegar. He then gives from Archigenes a long list of compositions for\r\nallaying the pain of toothach, from which most of those mentioned by\r\nour author are taken. One of the articles which most frequently occurs\r\nin them is alum, a solution of which in the spirit of nitre was lately\r\nmuch cried up as a cure for toothach. Of the great number of substances\r\nrecommended to be put into the hole of the carious tooth it is difficult\r\nto form a judgment, as most of them are now never tried in such cases.\r\nSome of them seem plausible applications. One consists of pellitory with\r\nmyrrh; another of opium and pepper; others contain ginger, poppy-juice,\r\nhyoscyamus, galbanum, castor, &c. He approves of hot fomentations, and\r\nof the heated flour of barley or linseed applied to the cheek. He speaks\r\nfavorably of filling the hole in the tooth with hot wax. When part of a\r\ntooth projects, it is to be filed down with an iron file. For pains of\r\nthe gums he recommends fomentations with vinegar, in which henbane has\r\nbeen boiled. Of dentifrices he has treated at considerable length, and it\r\nis from him that our author takes his list.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus mentions alum among his remedies; and we may remark, by\r\nthe way, that this medicine is recommended for toothach by many of the\r\nearlier modern authorities. (V. Guido de Cauliaco, vi, 2.)\r\n\r\nCelsus delivers very judicious instructions for the treatment of\r\ntoothach. He circumscribes the use of wine, enjoins restricted diet, and\r\nfood which does not require mastication; then fomentations of hot water\r\nby means of sponges are to be applied to the tooth, and so forth. If the\r\npain is more violent, the belly is to be opened, hot cataplasms applied,\r\nand some warm liquid retained in the mouth, and often changed. The liquid\r\nmay be a decoction of some narcotic, such as poppies, mandragora, and\r\nhyoscyamus. He praises hot oil applied by means of a probe wrapped round\r\nwith wool. He also mentions compositions containing pellitory, alum,\r\nbitumen, and mustard. He directs us not to be in haste to extract the\r\ntooth.\r\n\r\nAëtius gives a variety of applications for removing teeth without an\r\noperation. One of them contains red arsenic; another sori and the juice\r\nof spurge. Modern dentists are ignorant of such remedies. His account\r\nof the nerve which supplies the teeth with sensibility is accurate, but\r\nborrowed from Galen.\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus, like our author, affirms that the juice of spurge\r\n(tithymallus) will make the teeth fall out. For the same purpose he\r\nlikewise praises the power of pellitory and mugwort. After Hippocrates he\r\napproves of the application of small bags containing salts or millet.\r\n\r\nThe medicinal substances recommended by Marcellus, the Empiric, are\r\nthe same as those already mentioned. He praises strongly a composition\r\nconsisting of acrid vinegar, alum, and cedar rosin, boiled to the\r\nconsistence of honey and applied to the carious tooth. To prevent hollow\r\nteeth from falling out he directs us to fill the hole with the gum which\r\ngrows upon the ivy. The juice of poppies pounded in a woman’s milk and\r\napplied to a carious tooth is said to remove the pain instantly. As a\r\ndentifrice he recommends finely-powdered glass with spikenard.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus recommends abstinence, rest, and rinsing the mouth with\r\nsome astringent decoction containing white poplar, mandragora, poppies,\r\nhenbane with vinegar, hot oil, milk and honey, and the like. He applies\r\nbags containing hot flour. If the pain does not abate, venesection is\r\nto be had recourse to, a cupping-instrument applied near the affected\r\npart, and the belly opened afterwards by a clyster. Sometimes the\r\ngums are to be scarified or separated from the teeth by means of a\r\nscarificator. Respecting anodyne medicines, he remarks that they diminish\r\nsensibility, but do not remove pain. He says, like the other authorities,\r\nthat the juice of the tithymallus, or spurge, breaks the teeth—“dentes\r\ninfringit.” He disapproves very much of early extraction, and mentions\r\nthat Herophilus and Heraclides of Tarentum relate cases of persons who\r\nhad died in consequence of this operation. He says that in the temple of\r\nApollo at Delphos there hung a tooth-extractor of lead, which was meant\r\nas a hint not to exert great force in extracting teeth. For bleeding of\r\nthe gums he recommends alum with honey, and the like.\r\n\r\nSerapion, like the Greek authorities, mentions a variety of remedial\r\nmeans for diseases of the teeth. One of his prescriptions consists of\r\nburnt alum, with vinegar, salt, and sumach. When the pain is violent he\r\ndirects us to fill the hole with opium or some other narcotic. Avicenna\r\nrecommends general bleeding, the application of leeches to the gums,\r\nopening the ranal veins, and cupping below the chin. His compositions\r\ncontain opium, burnt alum extinguished in vinegar, galls with vinegar,\r\nand the like. He mentions the juice of tithymallus, and several other\r\nsubstances, as possessing the property of making the extraction easy.\r\n\r\nAvenzoar recommends in particular bleeding from the ranal veins. Mesue’s\r\ngeneral treatment is very judicious, but similar to that of our author\r\nand the others. He also makes mention of alum and vinegar. He says that\r\nsome apply the actual cautery to the tooth. Haly directs us to heat two\r\nneedles red hot, and then, having dipped their extremities in oil, to\r\nburn the hole of the tooth with them. He recommends us to fill the hole\r\nwith a composition consisting of pellitory, sal ammoniac, opium, and\r\nwax. Some of his applications contain arsenic. That this article would\r\ndeaden sensibility, and might destroy the vitality of the diseased parts,\r\nwe can readily suppose, but of course it would require to be used with\r\nextreme caution. Certainly not more than two grains should be used, and\r\nevery precaution ought to be taken to prevent the patient from swallowing\r\nhis saliva. Haly, like most of the others, makes mention of alum.\r\nAlsaharavius recommends general bleeding, cupping, scarifications, and\r\nleeches; then warm vinegar, or some warm anodyne infusion, is to be held\r\nin the mouth; or the part fumigated with the vapour of water in which\r\nopium, camphor, or henbane has been boiled. He speaks also of the actual\r\ncautery. Rhases recommends bleeding, cupping, alum in vinegar, opium,\r\nhenbane, &c.\r\n\r\nThe dentifrices and applications to the gums recommended by the Arabians\r\nare similar to those of the Greeks. See in particular Haly Abbas (Pract.\r\nv, 78); Rhases (Cont. v); and Alsaharavius (Pract. viii, 2.) Like our\r\nauthor’s, theirs contain such astringents and aromatics as balaustine,\r\nsumach, galls, spikenard, wild mint, cinnamon, salt of gem, and the like.\r\nThe pumice-stone in particular was much used for this purpose; but, as\r\nDr. Hill remarks, it is apt to hurt the enamel.\r\n\r\n_On ranula._ Aëtius, Actuarius, and most of the other authorities\r\nrecommend similar applications. They consist of astringents and\r\nescharotics.\r\n\r\nAvicenna calls the ranula an enlargement and induration of the sublingual\r\ngland. He approves of nearly the same treatment as our author. He\r\nrecommends in particular burnt vitriol and hermodactylus with the white\r\nof an egg. Alsaharavius recommends, in the first place, applications\r\ncontaining nitre, sal ammoniac, and the like. If these do not succeed,\r\ncaustics are to be applied, so as to occasion a blackening of the part.\r\nIf this does not answer, an operation must be performed. Rhases makes\r\nmention of an application containing green copper, vitriol, &c.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the manner in which the veterinary surgeons treated\r\nranula in cattle, see Columella (vi, 8), and Vegetius (Mulom. iii, 3.)\r\nThey recommend the tumour to be opened and stimulants applied to it, such\r\nas garlic pounded with salt.\r\n\r\nThe disease which Hippocrates describes by the name of ὑπόγλωσσις appears\r\nto have been somewhat different from the one we have been treating of.\r\nThe hypoglottis of Hippocrates was an inflammatory swelling of the tongue\r\nending in abscess. When matter forms, he directs us to open the abscess.\r\nIt is also described by Aretæus.\r\n\r\n_For inflammation of the tonsils and of the uvula._ Since, as Galen\r\nremarks, the same treatment applies to inflammation of the tonsils and\r\nuvula, we shall treat of both together.\r\n\r\nAretæus has described inflammation of these parts with great accuracy\r\nand minuteness. He has also given a very circumstantial account of the\r\nulcers which occur there. Some, he says, are common, mild, and not\r\ndangerous; others are uncommon, pestilential, and fatal. The latter\r\nare described as being covered with a livid or black crust. The ulcer,\r\nhe says, is apt to spread to the tongue, or it passes down the trachea\r\nand proves fatal by occasioning suffocation. The disease, he says, is\r\nbrought on by cold acrid substances, and sympathy with disease of the\r\nstomach or lungs. Children are most subject to it. It is endemial in\r\nSyria and Egypt. He gives a striking description of death occasioned by\r\nsuffocation. With regard to the treatment, when the parts are inflamed,\r\nswelled, and threaten suffocation, he advises copious bleeding from the\r\narm, acrid clysters, purgatives, ligatures to the extremities, astringent\r\nand emollient applications to the parts, cupping the hind-head or breast,\r\nand other such means. Respecting the pestilential ulcers, when attended\r\nwith inflammation and sense of suffocation, he approves of clysters,\r\nvenesection, gargles, fomentations, ligatures to the extremities,\r\ncupping, and so forth. When the disease is spreading, he directs us to\r\nburn the sore with powerful caustics, such as alum with honey, chalcitis\r\nand the like. Sometimes, as he remarks, the uvula and parts there are\r\neaten down to the bone.\r\n\r\nGalen gives a long and very interesting account of these complaints\r\nintermixed with curious extracts from Archigenes. The general treatment\r\nconsists of venesection, acrid clysters, and purgatives. The local\r\napplications are mostly of an acrid and austere nature.\r\n\r\nWhen the tonsils suppurate, Aëtius directs us to open the abscess. He\r\ngives an interesting description of pestilential ulcers, which, however,\r\nis not very different from that of Aretæus. He approves of bleeding at\r\nthe arm, suppositories, clysters, ligatures to the extremities, and\r\nso forth. The subsequent Greek authors follow him and Galen in their\r\ndescriptions.\r\n\r\nMarcellus, the Empiric, recommends for swelled uvula various escharotic\r\napplications containing chalcitis, flos æris, alum, &c.\r\n\r\nCelsus delivers a brief account of ulcers of the internal fauces. He\r\nspeaks in rather equivocal terms of warm cataplasms, fomentations and\r\nfumigations; but is, upon the whole, inclined to permit the use of them\r\nif there be no danger of cold afterwards. He very properly forbids\r\nsuch things as will irritate the parts. He does not approve much of\r\ngargles of vinegar, although recommended by Archigenes, whom he calls,\r\n“multarum rerum auctor bonus.” He prefers emollient gargles at first, and\r\nafterwards repellent ones.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians treat inflammation of these parts like the Greeks. Avicenna\r\nfollows closely our author’s plan of treatment. Mesue approves of\r\nbleeding, clysters, and so forth. Rhases mentions bleeding and gargles\r\nwith vinegar, the water of roses, and other astringents. In inflammation\r\nof the uvula, Haly Abbas recommends general bleeding, gentle purgatives,\r\nand astringent gargles containing alum, pomegranate flowers, sal\r\nammoniac, and the like; and when these do not succeed, he advises us\r\nto have recourse to the operation. (See Book Sixth.) Alsaharavius\r\nrecommends a plan of treatment perfectly similar, and, like Haly, directs\r\nus to have recourse to excision when other remedies fail. Alexander\r\nAphrodisiensis says, however, that those who have had the uvula cut off\r\ndie of consumption; and attempts to account for the operation having this\r\neffect. (Probl. ii, 3.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna and the other Arabians make mention of the amulet recommended by\r\nGalen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXVII.—ON ANGINA, OR QUINSEY, AND THE COMPLAINTS ALLIED TO IT;\r\nIN WHICH THE SUBJECT OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN STRANGLED OR OTHERWISE\r\nSUFFOCATED IS TREATED OF.\r\n\r\nWhen the parts within the throat are inflamed, the disease is called\r\n_synanche_; when those without it, _parasynanche_. In like manner,\r\nwhen the parts within the windpipe are inflamed, the disease is called\r\n_cynanche_; and when those without it, _paracynanche_. All these\r\ncomplaints are attended with orthopnœa and pain, with difficulty of\r\nbreathing, and in some cases with fever. There is redness of the face\r\nand neck, and swelling in some cases, and sometimes the mouth is kept\r\nconstantly open, and they cannot swallow drink. Cases of cynanche are\r\nsometimes attended with a sense of suffocation. This disease attacks\r\nchildren but rarely, and then only from injuries of the spinal vertebræ\r\noccasioned by a fall, which case, being incurable, is not to be meddled\r\nwith. In the others, we must immediately bleed from the arm, and take\r\naway not a great quantity at once, but in divided quantities; for from\r\na rapid evacuation there is danger of suffocation, owing to the matters\r\nrushing to the affected part, if the patient should faint. Should they\r\nnot be immediately relieved by it, we must open the veins below the\r\ntongue; or make incisions into the tongue itself, if it be swelled and\r\nprotrude out of the mouth. The bowels are to be evacuated by acrid\r\nclysters; hot water is to be poured upon the feet, and the extremities\r\nfirmly bound with ligatures. The neck is to be wrapped in unwashed wool,\r\nor in wool smeared with oil, and a cataplasm of raw barley-meal applied.\r\nAt the commencement we may use the gargles described for inflammation of\r\nthe tonsils, or the simple medicine from mulberry, with the decoction of\r\nsumach; but the best remedy is that from wild mulberry, and after that\r\nthe compound application from mulberry, or the parts are to be anointed\r\nwith the composition from walnuts. When the disease is at its height, we\r\nmay add a little nitre or sulphur vivum, unless the acrimony prohibit\r\ntheir use. And dog’s dung, dried and powdered, and rubbed in with honey,\r\nis a most excellent application, more especially the white kind; also\r\nthe dung of wild swallows, in like manner. When the complaint is of long\r\nstanding, we may use the liniment from besasa, or wild rue, sometimes\r\nincreasing and sometimes diminishing its strength, by the mixture of\r\nother medicines. Cupping-instruments or leeches are to be applied to the\r\nchin and neck, and the patients must use the stronger gargles from iris,\r\nhyssop, gith, southernwood, liquorice, dried figs boiled in honied water,\r\nor in the juice of rue with milk, or mustard with oxymel. If irritation\r\narise from the use of them, we must give warm oil of the finest kind,\r\nor rose-oil by itself, or with the juice of ptisan or of fenugreek, to\r\ngargle with. The food should be honied water until the third day, after\r\nwhich the juice of ptisan, with some of the sweet drinks, and then the\r\nyelks of eggs in a liquid state. They may use spoon-meats made from\r\nchondrus, when deglutition is unobstructed, and take food suitable to\r\ntheir strength. When the disease is on the decline, we may get them to\r\ntake exercise and the bath. The parts are to be enveloped in a cerate\r\nof the oil of rue; and we must have recourse to the other means of an\r\nanaleptic nature.\r\n\r\nIn suspended animation, such as have the foam already at their mouth we\r\nmust do nothing to, agreeably to the precept of Hippocrates (Aph. ii,\r\n43); but the others may be resuscitated by pouring into their mouths\r\nvinegar and pepper, or the fruit of the nettle pounded in the strongest\r\nvinegar. It is with difficulty that they swallow it, but they must\r\nbe compelled; and when the redness about the neck is dispelled, they\r\nimmediately look up and recover. The same means are to be used towards\r\nthose who have been wrecked in the sea; and, in fine, towards all\r\nthose whose respiration has been suspended; for their heat is thereby\r\nresuscitated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Hippocrates (de Victu Acutorum, 39; de Prognos.; de\r\nMorbis, ii, iii); Galen (de Med. sec. loc. vi; de loc. Affect. iv);\r\nAretæus (de Morb. Acut. i, 7); Alexander (iv, 1); Aëtius (viii, 48);\r\nOribasius (Morb. Curat. iv, 71); Leo (iv, 10); Actuarius (Meth. Med.\r\niv, 14); Celsus (iv, 4); Nonnus (123); Scribonius Largus (16); Cælius\r\nAurelianus (Morb. Acut. iii, 1); Octavius Horatianus (ii, 6); Marcellus\r\n(de Med. 15); Serapion (ii, 18); Avicenna (iii, 9); Mesue (de Ægr.\r\nGutturis); Avenzoar (i, 10); Haly Abbas (Pract. i, 26, and vi, 2);\r\nAlsaharavius (xi, 2); Rhases (ad Mansor. ix, 54, and iv, 25; and Contin.\r\nvii).\r\n\r\nThe plan of treatment recommended by Hippocrates can scarcely be\r\nimproved upon: general bleeding, opening the veins below the tongue,\r\ngiving warm gargles and linctuses, shaving the head, wrapping the neck\r\nin soft wool, or applying fomentations to it, giving honey and water,\r\nor ptisan not cold, and administering clysters or purgative medicines.\r\nAccording to Le Clerc, he performed bronchotomy in extreme cases. He\r\nrefers, we suppose, to lib. iii, 11, ‘de Morbis,’ but the language is\r\nnot so precise as to make it quite certain that bronchotomy was there\r\nmeant to be described. Sprengel supposes that he only introduced a tube\r\nby the nostrils into the trachea. He describes a species of cynanche in\r\nwhich there is no external swelling, and which proves fatal in the course\r\nof a day, or at least of a very short time. (Prog.) Cynanche, he says\r\nelsewhere, is apt to be determined to the lungs. (Aph.) Fever, again he\r\nsays, attending ulcerated sore throat is bad. (Prog.) When the tonsils\r\nare swelled and red, he says it is dangerous to scarify them. (Ibid.) His\r\ncommentator Stephanus remarks that when the disease becomes indolent the\r\npart may be burned or cut.\r\n\r\nAretæus states that the parts affected with synanche are the tonsils,\r\nepiglottis, fauces, uvula, the upper part of the trachea, and, if\r\nthe inflammation spread, the tongue and jaws. He makes a distinction\r\nbetween cynanche and synanche. The former is attended with swelling\r\nof the parts and other well-known symptoms, of which he has given a\r\nstriking description. In synanche (which he attributes to the _pneuma_\r\nbeing over-heated and over-dried), the parts, on the contrary, are\r\ncontracted, and there is a strong sense of suffocation. This disease,\r\nhe says, generally proves soon fatal, unless swelling and inflammation\r\nof the parts supervene, or erysipelas of the breast occur; in imitation\r\nof which, he states that a good physician will apply a sinapism or\r\ncupping-instrument to the chest to produce revulsion. In treating of the\r\nformer variety of the disease, he begins with administering two clysters\r\nto evacuate the bowels and produce revulsion; he bleeds in the arm from a\r\nlarge orifice so as _nearly_ to bring on deliquium animi, and he approves\r\nalso of bleeding by opening the veins below the tongue: he recommends\r\napplications at first of an astringent nature, but, if suppuration be\r\nexpected, he directs hot ones from fenugreek, hot fomentations, sponges\r\nsqueezed out of the decoction of bay or hyssop, and the like, to be used.\r\nIn the other variety, he recommends us to determine outwardly by all\r\npossible means, such as by applications containing nitre, mustard, &c. He\r\nsays the application of fire would be most suitable in such cases, but\r\nas it cannot be applied from the situation of the disease, he recommends\r\nmedicines which resemble fire (caustics), so as to stop the ulceration\r\nfrom spreading. The caustics and astringents mentioned by him are alum,\r\ngalls, pomegranate rind, and in particular calcined _chalcitis_. The\r\nlast was a vitriol resembling sulphate of copper. (See the preceding\r\nSection.) He mentions that in this variety some were said to have opened\r\nthe windpipe, in other words to have performed laryngotomy. He does not\r\nbelieve, however, that the operation had ever actually been performed,\r\nand dissuades from attempting it, as it would only increase the evil; and\r\nhe apprehended that the wound in the cartilages would never heal. From\r\nhis account of synanche, Le Clerc concludes that Aretæus belonged to the\r\nPneumatic sect; and although Ackerman is doubtful upon this point, we\r\ncould point out many passages in his works which have quite satisfied us\r\non this point. By _pneuma_ was probably meant the vital heat in the body,\r\nacted upon by a spiritual substance within us, the same being a portion\r\nof that principle which the ancient philosophers called nature. It was\r\ntruly a _vis medicatrix_. (See Morb. Chron. cur. i, 7.)\r\n\r\nCelsus, like Aretæus, describes the two varieties of the disease, and\r\nrecommends nearly the same treatment.\r\n\r\nGalen, and after him Aëtius, give a similar account with great minuteness\r\nand precision. We cannot pretend to do justice to their treatment, and\r\nshall merely mention that, in the second variety, they praise mustard\r\nfor a gargle, and elaterium as a purgative. It is worthy of notice that\r\nGalen describes a rare species of this disease, in which the tongue is so\r\nswelled that the mouth cannot contain it. (Meth. Med. i.)\r\n\r\nAlexander’s directions are most minute and judicious, but we must be\r\ncontent with stating that he approves of opening the ranal and jugular\r\nveins, and that his treatment is otherwise similar to that of Galen. This\r\nis the first mention of opening the jugulars that occurs in a medical\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus we shall merely mention, in order to state that he\r\nhas described the two varieties of the disease like the others.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus gives a singularly accurate and circumstantial account\r\nof this disease, but it is so long that we can merely afford room to\r\npoint out a few of his leading opinions. He approves of a fomentation\r\nmade with a bladder half filled with hot sweet oil. He directs the\r\npatient to inhale the steam of hot water, and to have sponges squeezed\r\nout of it applied to the neck and throat. He approves of cupping the\r\nneck or of leeching it, and also of scarifying the tongue and fauces if\r\nthey are much swelled. With respect to the treatment of the other sects,\r\nhe blames Hippocrates for making too rapid a detraction of blood, and\r\nalso for opening the veins below the tongue, which, he says, will only\r\naggravate the evil, and may be productive of inconvenience, owing to the\r\ndifficulty of stopping the bleeding. But, in particular, he finds fault\r\nwith Archigenes for mentioning laryngotomy, and treats the operation as\r\nentirely fabulous and the fiction of that physician. His aversion to\r\nit is so strong that he pronounces it a crime. Before having done with\r\nthis author, we may remark that Prosper Alpinus, the modern advocate\r\nfor ancient Methodism, does not agree with Cælius in condemning the\r\nHippocratic practice of opening the veins below the tongue. In his own\r\ncase he had experienced the good effects of this practice. (Meth. Med.\r\nvii, 10.)\r\n\r\nThe Arabians, like their Grecian masters, describe the two varieties of\r\nthe disease, and treat them accordingly. For the variety called synanche\r\nby the Greeks, they approve of hot gargles consisting of mustard, pepper,\r\nand the like. This resembles the modern practice of using gargles of\r\nCayenne pepper. In the following passage, Rhases evidently points at\r\nthe contagious synanche: “It happens on certain years in spring that a\r\nbad and destructive species of synanche attacks a great many persons.\r\nWherefore at such a time it will be proper to anticipate the disease by\r\nvenesection, abstracting blood from the legs with cupping-instruments,\r\nopening the belly, and gargling with rose-water, or infusions of sumach,\r\nmulberries, and nuts.” Haly Abbas likewise states that the disease is\r\nsometimes epidemical. Rhases approves of general bleeding, of opening\r\nthe sublingual veins, and of using astringent gargles at first, and\r\nafterwards maturative ones consisting of figs, sweet almonds, and the\r\nlike. In his ‘Continens’ he seems to allude to bronchotomy. Alsaharavius\r\ndescribes the two varieties of the disease with great minuteness. He\r\nagrees with the others as to the danger of that variety in which\r\nthere is no swelling nor inflammation outwardly. Avicenna and other\r\nof the Arabians follow Alexander in recommending bleeding by opening\r\nthe jugulars. The two kinds of angina, mentioned by the ancients, are\r\ndescribed in similar terms by Sydenham, Boerhaave, and Van Swieten. The\r\nfirst variety, or common quinsey, is well known. The second is of less\r\nfrequent occurrence. The modern authorities have found it as fatal as\r\nthe ancients gave them reason to expect. The reader will find a very\r\ninteresting commentary on Aretæus’ description of malignant sore throat\r\nin a tract, ‘de Recondita Abscessum Natura.’ (Mangeti Bibl. Chirurg. i,\r\n48.) It is the disease now called _laryngitis acuta_.\r\n\r\nHaly approves of the treatment recommended by our author in cases of\r\nsuspended animation. In treating those who have been in water, he\r\ndirects, very improperly we are convinced, the patient to be hung by the\r\nheels, to favour the escape of the water by the mouth. It would appear,\r\nhowever, from the late experiments of Professor Meyer, that the ancients\r\nwere correct in supposing that water is generally found in the lungs of\r\ndrowned persons. When a person has hung by the neck for a time, and there\r\nis any prospect of recovery, Haly directs us, as soon as he can swallow,\r\nto make him gargle with oil of violets and tepid water, and to drink\r\nbarley-gruel and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXVIII.—ON CORYZA, CATARRH, AFFECTIONS OF THE TRACHEA, AND COUGH.\r\n\r\nAll these complaints have this in common, that they are occasioned by\r\nthe defluxion of a redundant humour from the head to the parts below.\r\nWhen, therefore, it seats in the nostrils, the disease is called coryza;\r\nwhen in the pharynx and roof of the mouth, simply catarrh; but when it\r\nattacks the larynx and arteria trachea, so as to occasion a roughness of\r\nthe membrane which lines them, the voice becomes hoarse, and the disease\r\nis called branchus, or morbus arteriacus: these terms being applicable\r\nnot only to the inflammatory roughness occasioned by a defluxion from\r\nthe head, but also to that arising from vociferation and inhaling cold\r\nair. When the complaint is protracted, and the defluxion is carried down\r\nto the chest and lungs, it gives rise to bad coughs. And a cough often\r\narises from an intemperament; sometimes a hot one, as in fevers, and\r\nsometimes a cold, as in northerly states of the weather, which is rather\r\na dry one. Cough is also sometimes symptomatic of some other disease,\r\nsuch as pleurisy, hepatitis, phthisis, or peripneumonia. Wherefore Galen\r\nrelates that, in certain chronic cases of cough, chalazia (hail-stones)\r\nhave been brought up from the chest. But Alexander relates that a certain\r\nheavy stone, like that which forms in the urinary organs, was brought up\r\nin a chronic cough, upon which the cough ceased. We ourselves have seen\r\na discharge of stones with vomiting of blood, as we will describe more\r\naccurately when we come to that part. Those who have coryza and catarrh\r\nfrom exposure to heat have a sensation of heat about the parts, and a\r\nrunning of acrid and thin humours from the nostrils and mouth, and there\r\nis redness about the face and nose. When they are occasioned by cold,\r\nthere is distension about the head and forehead, and obstruction of the\r\nethmoid pores, so that the voice does not resound through the nose; and\r\nwhen they are protracted, cough supervenes, and expectoration of phlegm,\r\nwhich is sometimes unconcocted and fluid, and sometimes green. In some\r\ncases fever comes on, which does not alleviate the complaint when it\r\nproceeds from heat, but when from cold it promotes concoction.\r\n\r\n_The cure of catarrh and of coryza._ When a hot intemperament prevails,\r\nthose remedies will apply which suit with headachs from the same cause.\r\nThey must have recourse to baths, and have a large quantity of hot water\r\npoured upon the head. The food most befitting are spoon-meats and eggs\r\nin a state to be supped, starch, sweet cake, sesame, rice, almonds, the\r\nfruit of the cones of pine, and all confections from milk. The wines\r\nwhich are drunk should be sweet and not old. The lohoch from poppy-heads,\r\ncalled diacodium, and other compound medicines for these complaints,\r\nare to be taken. When a cold intemperament prevails, and the disease is\r\ndifficult to remove, a restricted diet is to be observed, and the head\r\nanointed with some heating and attenuating ointment, such as that of nard\r\nor rue. But the ointment of iris is not only to be rubbed in, but is also\r\nto be injected into the nostrils; and, internally, they are to be rubbed\r\nwith frankincense and myrrh, with oil; and this more especially when the\r\ncoryza arises from cold. But these are remedied by odoriferous substances\r\nwith burnt linen, or by gith and cumin burnt and bound up in a linen rag.\r\nLet them also smell to the cyphi seleniacum, and let it be rubbed into\r\nthe forehead; and to it let there be added one of the antiphlogistic\r\nplasters, such as the Icesian, the Oxera, the Barbarum, and the Athena.\r\nFor catarrh from cold it will be expedient to drink of cyphi, and to\r\nrub into the chest the juice of balsam by means of unwashed wool; or to\r\napply calefacients to it, along with storax, the ointment of iris, or\r\nthat of dill. Let them also use hot and concocting food. But when the\r\nmatter is already concocted, a masticatory will answer well with them,\r\nand detergent ointments (_smegmata_) to the head, such as the soap of\r\nConstantine, and the like.\r\n\r\n_The cure of affections of the trachea, or hoarseness._ For the complaint\r\ncalled arteriacus and branchus, those things already mentioned will\r\napply; but, in particular, when an inflammatory affection of the trachea\r\nand larynx prevails, we must, at the commencement, use the emplastic\r\nremedies, until the inflammation become more moderate; such as those\r\nfrom Cretan sweet wine, tragacanth, gum, and starch, and a decoction of\r\nthe fatty dates and that of liquorice, with rob, until it become of the\r\nconsistency of honey. And we must use that class of electuaries called\r\nhypoglottides. But, above all things, the patient at this period must\r\nabstain from drinking wine; but when the inflammation becomes moderate,\r\nhe may take some sweet wine. And let him use those spoon-meats which\r\nare made from honey and milk, with starch, and bread of fine flour, and\r\nalmond emulsions; and let him take butter. When a humour remains fixed\r\nin the parts, he must have recourse to detergent remedies, such as the\r\nporridge of beans, and those things which are prepared from honey,\r\ncabbage, and well-boiled leeks. He may also take the hotter medicines,\r\nand those used for the cough, in the rob of dried figs, of frankincense,\r\niris, turpentine, storax, galbanum, pepper, cinnamon, cassia, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n_On cough._ Coughs are to be cured by the same method, attending only to\r\nthis, whether they be occasioned by sympathy with other parts, such as\r\na defluxion from the uvula or head, and whether they be symptomatic of\r\nother diseases; in which case, they are to be disposed of in the manner\r\nalready mentioned, or as will be described afterwards. An exposition of\r\nthe compound remedies follows.\r\n\r\n_Pills for catarrh and cough._ Of storax, of myrrh, of opium, of\r\ngalbanum, equal parts; mix with must, or pound by themselves in a mortar,\r\nand make into pills the size of a tare. Give three, four, or five at\r\nbedtime, and swallow with some must. These things are for an acrid and\r\nthin rheum.—_Another_: Of the seed of henbane, dr. xij; of pine-nuts, dr.\r\nvj; of saffron, dr. ij. Mix with rob or with must, and use.\r\n\r\n_An electuary._ Of honey, oz. j; of butter, oz. ss. Boil together and\r\ngive; and let the decoction of hyssop, of figs, of pine-nuts, and of\r\niris, be swallowed.\r\n\r\n_Pills for more inveterate coughs._ Of storax, dr. vj; of myrrh, dr.\r\niiss; of turpentine, of galbanum, of opopanax, and of iris, of each, dr.\r\nij; of white pepper, of nitre, of henbane-seeds, of the juice of poppy,\r\nof each, dr. j. Beat in a mortar without any liquid, form into pills, and\r\nuse as formerly directed.\r\n\r\n_For roughness of the windpipe, cough, and bloody expectoration._ Of\r\nbitter almonds whitened, xxv in number; of toasted linseed, dr. iv; of\r\ntragacanth, dr. ij; of pine nuts, xxx grains; the yelk of an egg roasted\r\nin dough. The tragacanth is macerated with water, and the whole mixed\r\nwith must. If the sound of the voice be broken, mix honey instead of the\r\nmust, more particularly when there is anything to expectorate.\r\n\r\n_An arteriac to be kept below the tongue for those who have lost the\r\nvoice, for hoarseness, and bloody expectoration._ Of tragacanth, dr.\r\nvj; of gum, dr. vj; of myrrh, dr. iss; of white pepper, xx grains; of\r\nsaffron, dr. j; of liquorice-juice, dr. vj; the flesh of three dates; of\r\nCretan sweet wine, q. s. The juice of the tragacanth alone placed under\r\nthe tongue answers very well. Instead of the juice of liquorice, its\r\ndecoction boiled down to the proper consistence may be substituted in\r\nquadruple quantity.\r\n\r\n_An arteriac for loss of voice, suiting also for strengthening the\r\nvoice._ Boil six leeks to a third part; throw them away, but with the\r\ndecoction mix the juice of alica and honey; boil with them the yelks of\r\nthree eggs previously boiled, stirring with a branch of dill.\r\n\r\n_For coughs._ Of pennyroyal, oz. ij; of pine-nuts, of bastard saffron,\r\nof linseed, of each, oz. j; of white pepper, oz. iv; mix with boiled\r\nhoney.—_Another_: Of hyssop, of pennyroyal, of pepper, of each, oz. j; of\r\nMacedonian parsley, oz. ss; of honey, a hemina.\r\n\r\n_For concocting an inveterate cough._ Of honey, dr. xvj; of turpentine,\r\ndr. ij; of galbanum, dr. xiv. Having boiled them together, and having\r\nformed to the size of beans or of walnuts, let them be sucked.—_Another_:\r\nA dry cough is cured by the arteriacs, and also by the drinking of hot\r\nwater; for, not being able to expectorate, owing to the thickness of the\r\nphlegm, they are assisted in so far by diluents. A decoction from hyssop,\r\nand iris, and pine-nuts, also answers with them.\r\n\r\n_A trochisk to be inhaled for a continued cough._ Of storax, of pepper,\r\nof mastich, of Macedonian parsley, of each, oz. j; of sandarach, scr.\r\nvj; two bay-berries; mix with honey; and fumigate by throwing them upon\r\ncoals, so that the person affected with the cough may inhale the vapour\r\nthrough a funnel. It answers also with those affected by cold in anywise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. All the writers referred to in the preceding Section (with\r\nthe exception of Aretæus) may be consulted here.\r\n\r\nGalen, in the seventh book of his work, ‘de Med. sec. loc.’ has treated\r\nof these diseases so fully that he may be said to have exhausted the\r\nsubject. We can only afford room for a few of his general remarks. He\r\nstates that the arteriacs, or compositions for affections of the arteria\r\ntrachea, consist of three different kinds of medicines. First, those\r\ncalled by him obstruents, and answering to those now called demulcents,\r\nsuch as Cretan sweet wine, tragacanth, liquorice, and the like, which act\r\nby smoothing the asperities of the parts. Second, the acrid, containing\r\ncinnamon, turpentine-rosin, and the like. Third, the intermediate,\r\nconsisting of the juice of ptisan, almonds, and the like. He gives a\r\ngreat number of compositions from Andromachus, Criton, and others, which\r\nmight deserve attention. Of their ingredients some are expectorants, such\r\nas squills, myrrh, &c.; some demulcents, such as liquorice, tragacanth,\r\n&c.; and some narcotic, such as opium, mandragora, hyoscyamus, and\r\nhemlock. With the medicinal properties of the last-mentioned article\r\n(we mean the _conium maculatum_), which Dr. Paris commends so highly in\r\ndiseases of the chest, the ancients were sufficiently well acquainted.\r\nFor humid coughs Galen recommends a composition of alum, opium,\r\ngalbanum, and storax. He mentions lumbrici in the stomach as a cause of\r\ncoughs. (Com. in Epid. iii.) Among the remedies mentioned by our author,\r\nby Galen, and by most of the ancient authorities, we may remark the\r\ninhaling the fumes of certain acrid medicines, such as yellow orpiment\r\nand sandarach, or realgar, i. e. red orpiment. Whether the practice be\r\nsafe or not we shall not pretend to determine; but, unquestionably, it\r\nis recommended upon high authority; and therefore it is not true, as\r\nhas been often stated, that this practice arose from the mistake of\r\nconfounding the gum juniper, or vernix of the Arabians, also often called\r\nsandarach, with the sandarach of the ancients, or realgar. (See Bree\r\non Asthma, p. 231.) We refer to Aëtius (viii, 61); Pseudo-Dioscorides\r\n(Euporist. ii, 33); Pliny (H. N. xxxiv, 55); Alexander (v, 4); Myrepsus\r\n(xli, 76); Serapion (ii, 19, and 24); and Rhases (Cont. viii.) The\r\nancient veterinary surgeons used arsenic in fumigations for the coughs\r\nof cattle. See Vegetius (Mulom. iii, 67.) Platearius, a modern writer\r\nof the thirteenth century, recommends arsenic for chronic coughs, both\r\nin fumigations and taken into the stomach, and yet he distinguishes\r\nquite correctly the sandarach, or red arsenic, from the gum vernix. (De\r\nSimplici Medicina.) Some of the earlier writers on the venereal disease\r\nrecommend fumigations with arsenic for syphilitic ulcers of the throat.\r\n(V. Aphrodisiacus, and Sect. XXIX of this Book.)\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of a common catarrh, Celsus advises to abstain “a\r\nsole, balneo, vino, venere;” but to use “unctione et assueto cibo.” When\r\nthe lungs become affected he recommends much friction and exercise on\r\nfoot. He gives the following account of the origin of these complaints:\r\n“Destillat autem humor de capite interdum in nares, quod leve est;\r\ninterdum in fauces, quod pejus est; interdum etiam in pulmonem, quod\r\npessimum est.” The idea of the disease originating in the head and\r\nspreading downwards prevails in all the ancient descriptions of the\r\ndisease, and, we may mention, is now sanctioned by the authority of the\r\nillustrious Laennec. See, in particular, Aëtius, who copies, however, in\r\npart from Galen.\r\n\r\nAlexander devotes a whole chapter to the consideration of these\r\ncomplaints. He forbids diuretics, because they carry off the thin part\r\nof the humours and leave the thick behind. Respecting the chalazia\r\nmentioned by Galen, and “the smooth, hard, and firm stone” said to have\r\nbeen expectorated by Alexander’s patient, we have a few remarks to make.\r\nThe passage in Galen’s work where they are described is at ‘de Loc.\r\nAffect.’ iv, near the end. These sputa have been described by recent\r\npathologists. Thus Andral calls them small clots, of a dull white,\r\nor inclining a little to yellow, from a small pin’s head to a pea in\r\nsize. (Clinical Medicine, 464, Engl. ed.) The modern authorities agree\r\nthat they are indicative of phthisis. Aretæus describes by the name of\r\npneumodes, and as a species of asthma, a diseased state resembling that\r\nwhich we are treating of. The symptoms are dyspnœa, cough, and wasting;\r\npulse small, frequent, and feeble; the sputa, if any, small, white,\r\nround, and like hail. The disease proves fatal in the course of a year,\r\nand often ends in dropsy and anasarca.\r\n\r\nThe treatment recommended by the great Methodist Cælius Aurelianus\r\nis not much different from the practice of the other sects, only he\r\nenjoins a more rigid abstinence from wine and food of a heating nature.\r\nHe also condemns the practice of inhaling the vapours of red arsenic\r\n(sandaracha), and the like. In protracted cases he recommends a change of\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing original in the practice of the Arabians. Avicenna\r\nprudently forbids preparations of poppies after expectoration has\r\ncommenced. For coryza Haly Abbas recommends, if the patient’s age and\r\ntemperament permit, bleeding, a spare diet, abstinence from wine,\r\nfumigations with the vapours of camphor, lignum aloes, vinegar, &c.;\r\navoiding to lie on the back, and so forth. He treats at great length of\r\ncoughs, distinguishing them according as they are seated in the throat,\r\ngullet, or lungs, and whether they be sympathetic or not. For hoarseness,\r\nhe directs gargles from the seed of anise or fennel, or a decoction\r\ncontaining radishes, parsley, fennel, mastich, spikenard, iris, figs, &c.\r\nAlsaharavius treats fully of these complaints in much the same terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXIX.—ORTHOPNŒA, ASTHMA, AND DYSPNŒA.\r\n\r\nThose who breathe thick without fever, like those who have run fast, are\r\nsaid to be _asthmatic_, that is to say, to pant for breath; and from\r\ntheir being obliged to keep the chest erect for fear of being suffocated,\r\nthey are called _orthopnoic_. The affection arises from thick and viscid\r\nhumours becoming infarcted in the bronchial cells of the lungs. Dyspnœa\r\nis a common symptom which accompanies these and many other complaints.\r\nThe indication of cure in asthmatic complaints is to consume the viscid\r\nand thick humour by attenuant and detergent medicines. Wherefore the\r\nvinegar of squills will answer well with them, and the oxymel prepared\r\nfrom it; the baked squill itself when triturated with honey; the antidote\r\ncalled hiera, continued purging with drastic medicines, and vomiting\r\nfrom radishes. And, in like manner, the round birthwort may be drunk,\r\nthe root of the great centaury, the fruit and root of cow-parsnip, the\r\nfruit of calamint, hyssop, iris, and gith. Put a sextarius of slaters,\r\ninto an earthen vessel, roast upon the coals; when whitened, pulverize,\r\nand, mixing with boiled honey, give a mystrum thereof before and after\r\nfood. If there be any urgent necessity, before doing all these things,\r\nopen a vein and evacuate proportionably to the patient’s strength; and\r\nstimulate the belly by clysters. Externally to the chest we may apply\r\ncataplasms from figs, the flour of iris, and of barley, containing rosin,\r\nwax, and honey; and iris and manna may be sprinkled upon them. Some\r\nbenefit may also be derived from raw barley-flour, with rosin, wax, iris,\r\nand manna. We may use the more heating ointments, such as those of iris,\r\ndill, and rue. But the following application is particularly proper: Of\r\npumice-stone, p. j; of burnt lees of wine, p. iv; of arsenic, p. j; of\r\nthe schenanth, p. ij; of alcyonium, p. j; of aphronitrum, p. ij; pound,\r\nsift, mix with the ointment, and with it rub the parts about the chest,\r\nand use emollient ointments for attracting the humours.\r\n\r\n_A draught for asthmatics._ Of poley, of southernwood, of castor, of\r\nground pine, of ammoniac perfume, equal parts; mix with honey, and\r\ngive.—_Otherwise_: Some give a spoonful of aphronitrum in three cyathi\r\n(cupfuls) of honied water.—_Another_: Of aphronitrum, dr. ix; of pepper,\r\ndr. j; of laserwort, dr. ss; give a spoonful in water.—_Another_: Of\r\ncastor, of ammoniac perfume, of each, dr. vj; of pepper, xl grains; mix\r\nwith must, and give to the size of a bean in honied water.—_Another_:\r\nOf mustard, dr. j; of the spuma nitri, three oboli; of elaterium, a\r\ndiachylon (i. e. half an obolus): form the whole into eight trochisks,\r\nand give two every two days; for they will evacuate upwards gently. To\r\nthose who are choked for want of breath, give, of aphronitrum, dr. iij,\r\nwith three cyathi of hydromel, and sometimes with cardamom, and it will\r\nrelieve them immediately. It is also useful in ischiatic disease.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The following ancient works may be consulted: Hippocrates\r\n(Aphoris.); Galen (de Comp. Med. sec. loc. vii); Celsus (iv, 4); Aretæus\r\n(Morb. i, 11); Cælius Aurelianus (Morb. Tard. iii, 1); Aëtius (viii, 63);\r\nOribasius (Loc. Affect. iv, 79); Actuarius (Meth. Med. iv, 4); Marcellus\r\n(de Med. 17); Nonnus (127); Octavius Horatianus (ii, 2, 12); Serapion\r\n(ii, 24); Avicenna (iii, 10, 1, 38); Mesue (de Ægrit. Pect.); Haly Abbas\r\n(Pract. vi, 8; Theor. ix, 20); Alsaharavius (Pract. viii, 5); Rhases (ad\r\nMansor. ix, 56; Contin. viii.)\r\n\r\nOur author’s theory of the disease is borrowed from Galen, and seems very\r\nplausible. It being admitted by our best modern pathologists, that there\r\nis no organic alteration of structure in ordinary cases of convulsive\r\nasthma, it seems likely that the paroxysm is occasioned by thick and\r\nviscid humours infarcted in the lungs; or, most probably, in many cases\r\nfrom the system being loaded with such humours which nature casts off by\r\nthe lungs. We need scarcely add, that it is now well ascertained that\r\nasthma is frequently produced by _engorgement_ of the lining membrane of\r\nthe bronchi, thus forming what is called the dry catarrh. Galen, like our\r\nauthor, maintains that the use of attenuant and detergent medicines is\r\nindicated. His internal remedies are squills, pepper, wormwood, opopanax,\r\nstorax, sulphur, oxymel, millepedes, &c. He forbids all things which\r\nare either of a very hot or cold nature, as in either case they tend to\r\nthicken the humours.\r\n\r\nAëtius gives nearly the same account as our author, both having evidently\r\nborrowed from Galen. He strongly praises vinegar of squills, myrrh,\r\npepper, and the like. In certain cases he advises the application of the\r\nactual cautery to the head (see Book Sixth, Sect. I) under the impression\r\nthat the disease is occasioned by a defluxion from it. He also speaks of\r\nburning the chest in several places for the purpose of making issues; and\r\nfurther recommends strong rubefacients.\r\n\r\nAmong the articles recommended by Marcellus, the Empiric, for difficulty\r\nof breathing, we remark vinegar of squills, natron (_soda_), opium,\r\nhorehound, &c. The first article, it will be perceived, among his\r\nremedies for asthma is vinegar of squills. Almost all the ancient\r\nauthorities praise the virtues of squills in this disease.\r\n\r\nAretæus gives a good description of the symptoms of the disease, which he\r\nattributes to a humid, thick, and glutinous _matériel_ in the lungs. He\r\nsays, the lungs are primarily affected, and through them sympathetically\r\nthe diaphragm, and parts about the chest which assist in respiration. But\r\nif the heart be affected, he adds, the issue is speedily fatal. Among the\r\nincipient symptoms he mentions flatulence of the bowels, restlessness,\r\nand latent heat by night. As the paroxysm proceeds, the cheeks become\r\nred, the nose sharp, the eyes prominent as if from strangulation, there\r\nis a _râle_ even when awake, and still more so when asleep; the voice\r\nis humid and devoid of resonance, with an insatiable desire of cold\r\nair, panting, and orthopnœa. To these symptoms are added, paleness\r\nof the countenance, with the exception of the cheeks; profuse sweats\r\nabout the face and chest; constant and difficult coughing, with little\r\nexpectoration. His chapter on the treatment is lost.\r\n\r\nAs Oribasius, Actuarius, and Nonnus follow the principles laid down by\r\nGalen, we need not give any account of their opinions.\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus adopts Galen’s theory, which he thus explains:\r\n“Pingui autem et frigido phlegmate pulmonibus adhærente, cavernæ, vel\r\nmeatus, quibus naturaliter spiritus redditur et accipitur, concluduntur;\r\net ex hoc impedimento suspirium, vel anhelitus molestissimus, nascitur,\r\nut sedendo magis quam jacendo respiret.” He recommends bleeding, if\r\nnot contra-indicated; but, if that is the case, frequent abstinence.\r\nAmong his internal remedies we remark oxymel, gum ammoniac, castor, and\r\nvinegar of squills. He approves also of emetics. He recommends stimulant\r\napplications to the chest, also fomentations and sinapisms. A long\r\njourney, he says, is beneficial.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus disapproves of burning the head and of strong purging.\r\nHe approves of bleeding, if the patient’s strength permit, of clysters,\r\ncupping the breast, gestation, friction, vociferation, emetics from\r\nradishes, or even from hellebore, and of giving the vinegar of squills.\r\nHe speaks favorably of the cold bath. His description of humid asthma is\r\nvery striking, and has been commended by late authorities on the subject.\r\nThe sounds within the chest are thus described: “stridor, atque sibilatio\r\npectoris, cum vocis debilitate.”\r\n\r\nCassius discusses the question why there is a sibilant murmur in cases of\r\northopnœa, and decides that it is because the affection is a contraction\r\nand falling-in of the cells of the lungs, and the breath rushing through\r\na narrow passage produces this murmur. (Prob. 82.)\r\n\r\nSerapion recommends friction, exercise, squills, fumigations with\r\narsenic, &c. Mesue also recommends arsenic in various forms. Avicenna’s\r\naccount is particularly full and judicious. He properly remarks that\r\nasthma is sometimes connected with derangement of the heart, liver, and\r\nstomach. Like the others, he approves of arsenic, both in pills and in\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas, like Galen, refers asthma to a collection of gross phlegm\r\nabout the cells of the lungs. His remedies are of an attenuant and\r\nincisive nature, and he particularises the vinegar of squills. He\r\ncautions asthmatics to beware of indigestion, and, therefore, forbids\r\nexercise after food, but recommends it before a meal. After exercise\r\nhe enjoins hard friction, no doubt with the intention of favouring the\r\ncutaneous perspiration. Rhases commends squills and the tepid bath. Like\r\nthe others, he approves of inhaling the vapours of arsenic.\r\n\r\nVegetius, the veterinary surgeon, recommends squills with wine,\r\nassafœtida, and oil, for these complaints in cattle.\r\n\r\nRespecting the use of arsenic in asthma, Prosper Alpinus remarks:\r\n“Præterea audent aliqui arsenicum summè exitiale venenum illis exhibere.\r\nNarrant quidam nepotem patris fratri decrepito orthopnoico, ut cum\r\ninterimeret, clam in ferculo ex cucurbitâ parato porrexisse arsenicum,\r\ncoque non modo non interimisse decrepitum, verum et ab asthmate prorsus\r\nsanasse.” (De Meth. Med. x, 13.) He states further, by the way, both in\r\nthat work and in the one “de Medicina Ægyptiorum,” that the Egyptians\r\nwere in the practice, for the cure of asthma, of applying cones of\r\ncotton to the breast, and setting them on fire. Fracastorius, who\r\nrecommends this practice of imbibing the fumes of arsenic, for contagious\r\nphthisis, speaks of it in the following terms: “Nonnulli antiquorum\r\njubent Sandaracæ nidorem per anhelitum in pulmones trahi: quum autem\r\nSandaracam dico non eam intelligi volo quæ vernix vulgo vocatur, sed quæ\r\nauripigmentum a nobis dicitur: porro nec per auripigmentum velim a te\r\naccipi priorem illam speciem quæ citrina est sed alteram, quæ est ruffa,\r\net propriè Sandaraca vocatur.” (Morb. Contag. iii.)\r\n\r\nDr. Hill, however, properly remarks that the arsenic of the ancients, or\r\norpiment was a much more innocent substance than the factitious arsenic\r\nof the moderns. See also Cleaveland (Mineralogy p. 680.) The arsenic of\r\nthe ancients, in fact (as will be shown in the proper place), was the\r\nmineral substance called yellow orpiment, consisting of sixty-two parts\r\nof arsenic and thirty-eight of sulphur, according to the analysis of\r\nKlaproth. The sandarach was _realgar_, which consists of seventy-five\r\nparts of arsenic and twenty-five of sulphur.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXX.—ON PERIPNEUMONIA.\r\n\r\nPeripneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs, supervening, for the\r\nmost part, upon violent catarrhs, cynanche, asthma, pleurisies, or\r\nother complaints, but being sometimes the original affection. It is\r\naccompanied with difficulty of breathing, an acute fever of the ardent\r\ntype, weight and tightness of the chest, a râle, a seizure of the face\r\nwith great fulness, the morbific matter being determined upwards like\r\nfire. Wherefore the cheeks appear red, the eyes swelled, with falling\r\ndown of the eyebrows, and the cornea appears somewhat glossy. When the\r\nsymptoms incline to a more ardent type, it is to be apprehended that the\r\ninflammation is of an erysipelatous nature. When the disease originates\r\nfrom the conversion of other diseases into this, we must not have\r\nrecourse to venesection, more especially if the diseases be of a chronic\r\nnature, and if blood had been previously let. But, in the remissions,\r\nclysters are to be injected into the bowels, which are moved with\r\ndifficulty; or, when nothing contra-indicates, large cupping-instruments\r\nwith scarifications may be frequently applied to the breast and sides.\r\nBut if the peripneumonia was the original affection, and the strength\r\npermit, we must open a vein; or if not, we may cup, proportioning the\r\nevacuation of blood to the powers of the patient. Let draughts of the\r\njuice of ptisan, or of chondrus with honey, be taken, or from bitter\r\nalmonds with semilago, or chondrus having some sweet potion mixed with\r\nit, such as hydromel, apomel, or hydrorosatum. Fresh butter to the extent\r\nof three spoonfuls is also proper. The patient must also drink the\r\npropoma of the decoction of figs with hyssop, or of iris boiled in honied\r\nwater, or of powdered iris, to the amount of two spoonfuls sprinkled upon\r\nhonied water. This also evacuates downwards. To keep up the strength,\r\nhe should be made to drink frequently of honied water alone, and with\r\npine-nuts, and the seed of cucumbers. And cupping-instruments and the\r\ncerate of privet, having some iris sprinkled upon it; or the cerate of\r\nthe oil of rue and dried iris; or that made of wax, and rosin, marrow,\r\nbutter, hyssop, dried iris, and nard ointment, may be applied to the\r\nwhole chest and sides.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The reader is referred to the authorities on pleurisy, as\r\nmost of them treat of both diseases together.\r\n\r\nHippocrates recommends bleeding, purging, and attenuant drinks as his\r\ngeneral plan of treatment. If the appendix to his treatise on the Regimen\r\nin Acute Diseases be genuine he approved of carrying venesection the\r\nlength of inducing deliquium.\r\n\r\nAretæus gives a minute and faithful account of the disease, but his\r\ndescription is too long for our limits. He remarks that as the lungs have\r\nbut small nerves, there is little pain unless the investing membrane be\r\naffected. He states that when the suppuration takes place, a metastasis\r\nof the matter to the bladder or belly sometimes occurs and relieves\r\nthe patient, whereas, if it be determined to the lungs, it is apt to\r\nterminate in phthisis. He gives excellent directions for the application\r\nof his remedies, which are the same as those now in use, namely, copious\r\nbleeding (but so as to avoid deliquium), purging, attenuant and diluent\r\ndrinks, rubefacients, containing mustard, to the chest, alkaline\r\nsubstances, such as soda, given in the decoction of hyssop; and when the\r\nfever has subsided he allows wine devoid of astringency.\r\n\r\nAëtius makes the same remark as Aretæus respecting the metastasis of the\r\nmatter. His account of the disease is excellent, but like our author’s.\r\n\r\nCelsus properly states that the danger is greater than the pain.\r\nHis account of the treatment is too long for our limits, but is well\r\ndeserving of attention.\r\n\r\nAccording to Actuarius, in hot affections of the lungs the urine is first\r\na bright yellow, but if the disease gain ground, and dyspnœa and thirst\r\nsupervene, the urine becomes red and of a dark wine colour. (De Urinis,\r\nvii, 5.)\r\n\r\nAs the Arabians treat the disease like the Greeks, it is unnecessary to\r\nsay much of their practice. Haly Abbas describes the disease as a hot\r\ninflammation of the lungs, for which he recommends bleeding, cooling and\r\ndiluent draughts, containing linseed, fenugreek, barley, oil of almonds,\r\nliquorice, &c.\r\n\r\nRhases describes a species of pneumonia, requiring the use of tonics,\r\nanaleptics, and wine. He relates the case of a patient who, he affirms,\r\nwould infallibly have sunk under this disease, if he had not resisted\r\nthe advice of the other medical attendants, who prescribed the\r\nanti-inflammatory treatment and laxatives.\r\n\r\nAlthough our business be with facts and opinions, and not with words,\r\nwe are confident we shall be excused in giving here a short verbal\r\ndisquisition on one of the terms which occur in this Section, we mean\r\nῥωγμὸς, translated by us _rále_. It occurs again at Book Sixth, Sect.\r\nXXXIII, in the description of _laryngotomy_, and in Aretæus’s description\r\nof asthma (Morb. Chron. i, 11.) Cælius Aurelianus thus defines the term:\r\n“gutturis stridor quem Græci _rhogmon_ vocant.” (Morb. Acut. ii, 10.) In\r\nthe Latin translations of the Arabians it is made _oregmon_. See Rhases\r\n(Div. i, 5.) About the terms used by Hippocrates in describing _ráles_\r\nthere is some difficulty, owing to the differences of the readings. Thus\r\nin the appendix to the work on Regimen in Acute Diseases we read ῥωγμὴ\r\nin some MSS., and ῥωχμὴ in others. See Littré (Hipp. t. ii, 464.) In\r\nother places he uses ῥέγξις. (Ibid. 262.) In Psellus we read ῥεγμός. (Op.\r\nMed. l. 230.) These, as far as we know, are the only terms used by the\r\nancients for the noisy sounds of the respiration in the throat and chest.\r\nῬόγχος, in Latin rhonchus, we believe, always signifies _snoring_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXI.—ON SPITTING OF BLOOD.\r\n\r\nWhen the spitting of blood arises from rupture, a great quantity will be\r\nevacuated, and sometimes from an obvious cause, such as a fall, straining\r\nof the voice, and the like; and sometimes from an obscure cause, such as\r\nplethora, or immoderate cold; for cold, as Hippocrates says, occasions\r\nrupture of the veins. If it proceed from erosion, the discharge of blood\r\nwill not be rapid, but in small quantity, and will have been preceded by\r\nacrid and unwholesome food, or abstinence, or an acrid defluxion. When\r\nit arises from exhalation, none of the afore-mentioned circumstances,\r\nunless, perhaps, the plethora precedes; but a more moistening and heating\r\ndiet, the use of immoderate baths, and living in very hot places, may\r\nappear to occasion it: and it will neither supervene upon inflammations,\r\nnor fevers, nor pains, as in the case of erosion; but, on the contrary,\r\nthe patients will appear in all probability to be relieved by the\r\nevacuation. If the hemorrhoidal or the menstrual discharge in women be\r\nsuppressed, the renewal of these will remove the danger; and the like\r\ngood effects will result from discharges of blood by rupture, when the\r\ndisease is connected with plethora, unless the ulcer, or the greatness of\r\nthe loss of blood prove injurious. When the discharge of blood is from\r\nerosion, it is never productive of good. If it is brought up by vomiting,\r\nit is clear that it comes from the stomach or bowels, from which parts it\r\nis sometimes evacuated by the anus; but, if by coughing, it comes from\r\nthe respiratory organs; but if it is frothy and whitish, and is brought\r\nup at intervals, without pain and oppression, it is clear that it is\r\nbrought up from the lungs, upon which, in process of time, a continual\r\nfever will supervene, more especially if occasioned by erosion; and part\r\nof the substance of the lungs, bronchia, or veins, will be brought up.\r\nI knew a certain person affected with spitting of blood from the lungs,\r\nwho, after a time, with much coughing, and full evacuation of blood, spit\r\nup four or five stones, rough as caltrops, and of the weight of three\r\nor four siliquæ; and he was immediately relieved, but soon after fell\r\ninto a consumption and died. If the discharge consist of phlegm, with\r\na slight cough or hawking, and the expectoration be frothy and light,\r\nyou may know that it comes from the trachea. But if it consist of black\r\nand grumous blood, and there is pain in the part, it indicates that the\r\ndischarge is from the thorax, being transmitted by the lungs or bronchia.\r\nIf it be brought up with hawking, it is by the palate from the parts\r\nabout the pharynx. But if it flow from the head, it is evacuated with\r\nsome tickling and cough, for it runs down into the windpipe, and is again\r\nbrought up. Such discharges are commonly preceded by an acrid defluxion,\r\nheadach, or heaviness. Sometimes the evacuation of blood is from the\r\npalate, owing to a leech having been swallowed, and fixing on some of the\r\nparts there. But of this case we will treat on the subject of Poisons.\r\n\r\n_The cure._ Those who have a spitting of blood from catarrh are to be\r\nimmediately bled (unless the defluxion be very acrid), and a quantity\r\nof blood taken away proportionate to the strength. Ligatures are to\r\nbe applied around the extremities, and the whole body, excepting the\r\nhead, is to be rubbed with hot old oil, or with Sicyonian. Farinaceous\r\nfood, containing the juice of some austere fruit, such as that of\r\npomegranate, of apples, or of pears, is to be taken; or let these be\r\nboiled with it. When going to sleep, give them the trochisk from amber;\r\nand on the third day give some boiled honey to lick. If these do not\r\nsucceed, and the disease is protracted, shave the head, and use the\r\napplication from wild-pigeon’s dung; and after three hours remove this\r\napplication, and put the patient into a bath, taking care not to anoint\r\nthe head. Then, having given him spoon-meats for food, administer to\r\nhim the theriac antidote at bedtime, and repeat this next day; and rub\r\nin like manner the whole body, except the head, but to it apply the\r\ncerate from thapsia, or the like, and again use the spoon-meats. When\r\nthe complaint is protracted, apply a cupping-instrument to the back part\r\nof the head. But if the defluxion be of a very acrid nature, we must\r\nabstain from venesection, and have recourse to the food and remedies\r\nformerly described when treating of Catarrh, and such as are now to be\r\nmentioned. When the spitting of blood proceeds from cold, the chest\r\nshould be warmed, along with remedies which are of a desiccative nature;\r\nand we must give the medicine from two peppers, with the trochisk of\r\namber. Those who bring up blood from the respiratory organs, owing to\r\nrupture or anastomosis of the vessels, are to be bled from a vein,\r\nunless the discharge of blood be great. In every case, the patient is\r\nto be laid in a well-ventilated place, upon a steady couch, in an erect\r\nposition; and he ought to abstain from strong respiration and talking.\r\nTo the affected parts we may apply sponges soaked in tepid oxycrate;\r\nbut after the seventh day, unwashed wool, with the oil of roses, of\r\nmyrtle, or of lentisk, sometimes with vinegar, and sometimes with austere\r\nwine; or, if the discharge be great, we may apply fine flour and manna,\r\nwith vinegar, or alum and acacia, or pomegranate rind, or galls with\r\nvinegar, or dates with polenta and quinces boiled in austere wine.\r\nAfterwards we may put on the plaster from willows, more particularly\r\nif the discharge be moderate. But the following things are to be taken\r\nby the mouth: Purslain when eaten is of use (but its juice when drunk\r\nis more powerful), the flowers also of the wild pomegranate, the fruit\r\nof the bramble and its flowers, the fibrous part of the common oak,\r\nand the membrane under the shell of the acorn (but these are used more\r\nespecially in decoction); and yet those of the fagus and ilex are more\r\npowerful remedies. The Samian aster applies to every spitting of blood,\r\nand also the Lemnian earth, and bloodstone finely triturated with the\r\njuice of pomegranate or knot-grass. The dose of the stone should be\r\none scruple. The following compound remedies are useful; namely, the\r\ntrochisk from amber, that from coral, and that from Egyptian thorn, also\r\nthe powder composed of the earth called Samian aster, Lemnian earth,\r\ncoral, comfrey, and starch, of each, equal parts. When the disease is\r\noccasioned by erosion, more especially if a catarrh precede, we may mix\r\nhalf a part of opium. And the composition admitting of equal parts of\r\nSamian aster, agerat stone, and Lemnian earth, is an excellent remedy\r\nwhen drunk to the amount of two spoonfuls (cochlearia) in two cupfuls\r\n(cyathi) of plantain-juice.—_Another_: Of Lemnian sealed earth, dr. xvj;\r\nof Samian aster, dr. xviij; of starch, dr. viij; of sarcocolla, dr. iv;\r\nof gum, dr. ij. Of this in powder let one spoonful be taken with two\r\ncyathi of the decoction of dates. Let them also take cold oxycrate, or\r\nthe decoction of dates, of apples, of pears, of vine tendrils, or the\r\nlike. They may take food, if the strength urgently requires it, about the\r\nsecond or third hour, but if otherwise, about the fourth. Let it consist\r\nof bread that has been soaked in cold water, or halica, or chondrus,\r\nwith some of the refrigerant juices, such as those of pomegranate, or\r\nmyrtles, or with honey and unripe grapes mixed together, or eggs softly\r\nboiled, or cakes prepared from milk with some astringent. Of pot-herbs\r\nthey may take endive, succory, plantain, boiled with the oil of unripe\r\nolives and vinegar. Of autumnal fruits they may use apples, pears,\r\nmedlars, pomegranates, and the fruit of the cornel-tree. When they have\r\nno fever, their drink may consist of a small quantity of diluted wine;\r\nbut, when they have fever, of some of the afore-mentioned draughts, or\r\nCibyratic hydromel. Those who vomit blood may be treated on the same\r\nplan, only they must abstain from taking food often. They are easily\r\ncured, because the remedies taken by the mouth are applied directly to\r\nthe parts from which the blood flows. When blood is coagulated in the\r\nstomach, let the patient drink of rennet, more especially that of a\r\nhare, or the lixivial ashes of figs with water, or thyme, or savory with\r\nvinegar; or evacuations may be produced by means of milk divided into\r\nparts (_lac scissum_), or of aloes. Those who hawk blood from the palate\r\nmust use astringent gargles, and apply to the forehead and the rest of\r\nthe head the remedies for bleeding from the nose. Such is the treatment\r\nof spitting of blood, which must be carefully attended to, on account of\r\nthe danger from an immoderate discharge of it; for if a great quantity be\r\nevacuated, it will bring instant death, as in the case of a slaughtered\r\nanimal; but a continuance of the complaint threatens a conversion into\r\nphthisis. Wherefore, when everything is properly attended to, and the\r\ndischarge of blood ceases, their strength must be recruited by getting\r\nfish and the feet and brains of young swine. We must also direct them to\r\nget their bodies rubbed, to abstain from the frequent use of baths, from\r\ndrinking wine, and from mental emotions and venery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY.

We may mention, however, that he refers\r\none species to disease of the liver. (Coac. 450.) Aristotle states\r\nthat vomiting of blood is not dangerous when connected with obstructed\r\nmenstruation. (H. N. vii, 10.)\r\n\r\nThe description given by Aretæus is exceedingly accurate. Blood that is\r\ndischarged by the mouth, he remarks, may come from the fauces, nose,\r\nand palate, in which cases it is seldom attended with danger; or from\r\nthe lungs and arteria trachea, which is exceedingly dangerous, and may\r\nprove fatal either suddenly, or by terminating in consumption; or from\r\nthe stomach, which is less dangerous, as the remedies can be applied\r\ndirect to the part affected; or from the liver and spleen, which is a\r\nmore dangerous case, as the remedies cannot be so readily applied to\r\nthem. They all arise, he says, from rupture, erosion, or rarefaction. By\r\nrarefaction (ἀραιῶσις) he means the same as _exhalation_ (ἀναστόμωσις).\r\nIf the blood be black and thick, it comes from a vein; and if florid\r\nand thin, from an artery. Of these cases that in which it proceeds from\r\nrarefaction is said to be the least dangerous, as it may readily be cured\r\nby astringents. The circumstances and characters of all the other cases\r\nare stated with great accuracy and at some length. He concludes with the\r\nremark, that in hemoptysis the patient despairs from the first, whereas\r\nin consumption he flatters himself with the hopes of recovery to the\r\nlast. With regard to the treatment he directs that the patient be laid on\r\na firm couch (as all motion increases the complaint), in a cool place,\r\nand that he abstain from speaking and all mental emotions. In every case,\r\nif the patient’s strength will permit, he recommends venesection at the\r\nelbow. Ligatures, not so tight as to occasion pain, are to be applied to\r\nthe extremities. Over the place from which the blood flows he directs\r\nus to apply wool or sponges soaked in austere wine and rose-oil, or in\r\nvinegar. In certain cases he directs us to put an astringent plaster\r\nupon the chest. With regard to the medicines taken by the mouth, he\r\nrecommends astringents, especially coral, when the disease is occasioned\r\nby dilatation. These, however, are only to be given when no fever is\r\npresent. The diet is the same as that recommended by our author.\r\n\r\nThe account given by Celsus is very similar, and highly interesting.\r\nHe approves of bleeding, the internal and external use of vinegar, and\r\ncold water to drink. Part of his treatment deserves to be given in his\r\nown inimitable language: “Præter hæc necessaria sunt quies, securitas,\r\nsilentium. Caput cujus quoque cubantis sublime esse debet, rectèque\r\ntondetur. Facies sæpe aquâ frigidâ fovenda est. At inimica sunt vinum,\r\nbalneum, venus, in cibo oleum, acria omnia, item calida fomenta, conclave\r\ncalidum et inclusum, multa vestimenta corpori injecta, etiam frictiones.\r\nIn hoc casu per hiemem, locis maritimis; per æstatem, mediterraneis opus\r\nest.”\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus, among other remedies, mentions sponging the chest with\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\nPliny the elder recommends the juice of henbane in hemoptysis. (H. N.\r\nxxvi, 15.) See also Marcel. Empir. (17); Plin. Valerian. (iv, 69.)\r\n\r\nThe account given by Aëtius is full and judicious, but mostly borrowed\r\nfrom Galen. He approves of the internal use of vinegar, and of applying\r\nto the chest wool soaked in the same.\r\n\r\nOribasius, Actuarius, and Nonnus recommend internal remedies like those\r\nof our author.\r\n\r\nAlexander’s observations are exceedingly judicious; but we can only\r\nafford room to state his opinion of external applications. He approves of\r\nembrocations by means of wool soaked in rose-oil, or the like, with some\r\nvinegar or austere wine not very old; but recommends us to change the\r\napplication frequently, as by allowing it to remain it will only irritate\r\nand provoke the flow of blood. With such precautions Octavius Horatianus,\r\nin like manner, approves of sponging the chest with sour wine and water,\r\nor vinegar. Alexander properly forbids us to give anything warm, and\r\ncautions against violent exercise, anger, venery, and saltish food.\r\n\r\nGalen expounds the pathology and principles of treatment so fully, that\r\nwe cannot even venture to give an abridgment of his account, but will\r\nventure to recommend it to the serious attention of the medical reader.\r\nWe must not omit, however, what he says respecting the use of cold and\r\nastringent applications to the chest: “I do not, like most physicians,\r\napprove of applying externally astringents, or things which are of a\r\ncooling nature without astringency, in cases of hemorrhage; for it\r\nappears to me that they have sometimes a contrary effect from what they\r\nare intended to produce, as they occasion a determination inwardly, and\r\ncongestion in the deep-seated veins. I have therefore known cases of\r\npersons affected with spitting of blood who were evidently hurt by the\r\napplication of cold to the chest. Wherefore, in cases of hemorrhage, I\r\ndo not approve of the indiscriminate use of cold applications.” (Meth.\r\nMed. v, 6.) See also de Const. Artis Med. (16.) Galen mentions that blood\r\nmay run down from the fauces into the windpipe, and thereby occasion\r\ngroundless apprehensions of hemoptysis.\r\n\r\nIt deserves to be remarked that Dioscorides, Pliny, Galen, Alexander, and\r\nPaulus agree in recommending the hæmatite, or bloodstone for hemoptysis.\r\nIt is a native oxyde of iron.\r\n\r\nTo the long and accurate account given by Cælius Aurelianus it is\r\nimpossible to do justice in a short abstract. Passing over entirely his\r\ndescription of the symptoms, and explanation of the sources from which\r\nthe blood is discharged, we shall merely dwell upon a few points of his\r\npractice. He insists with proper earnestness on the necessity of complete\r\nrest, coolness, and abstinence from everything of a stimulant nature;\r\nand recommends the practice already often mentioned of applying to the\r\npart affected sponges or compresses soaked in cold water, or in water\r\nand vinegar, or in some astringent decoction. He also approves of the\r\napplication of ointments or plasters composed of galls, alum, the rind of\r\nthe pomegranate, and the like. From among his many internal medicines we\r\nwould point out the composition consisting of gum acacia, alum, and the\r\ndecoction of poppies. When the discharge does not stop before the third\r\nday, he recommends venesection. But if pain, difficulty of breathing,\r\nor a dry cough should come on, he approves of bleeding at an earlier\r\nperiod of the disease. He then directs us to give emollient epithemes,\r\nelectuaries containing frankincense and opium, and the like. When the\r\npain is protracted, he recommends us to apply cupping-instruments or\r\nleeches to the part affected. Food of a middle quality, milk, and\r\nthe like are to be given. From his strictures upon the practice of\r\nthe others, it appears that some of the medical sects had condemned\r\nvenesection, but it is satisfactory to know that most of the authorities\r\nwere agreed about the propriety of it. The Methodist forbids it when\r\nthere are no symptoms of inflammation present. It seems there were\r\ndisputes also about the propriety of ligatures to the extremities, but\r\nCælius pronounces in favour of this practice. He informs us further\r\nthat some questioned the propriety of giving vinegar, but he decidedly\r\napproves of it. When there is any inflammation, he disapproves entirely\r\nof astringents. He also condemns sudorifics and diuretics. He allows\r\nexercise only when the complaint has abated.\r\n\r\nMarcellus condemns ligatures to the extremities, but approves of applying\r\nto the chest a sponge soaked in cold water or acrid vinegar.\r\n\r\nWe have not room for many extracts from the Arabians, who, however,\r\nsupply little additional information, although they treat fully of the\r\ndisease. We would refer to Avicenna’s account as being particularly full\r\nand excellent. He approves of the internal use of vinegar, and when\r\nthere is a tickling cough, of anodynes, such as mandragora, henbane, and\r\npoppy. Rhases and Serapion approve of sponging the chest with vinegar.\r\nAverrhoes, who is fond of contradicting preceding authorities, condemns\r\nthe practice of giving vinegar in hemoptysis. Mesue recommends the use\r\nof chalybeate water for drink. He approves in general of astringents.\r\nHaly Abbas gives a very full and interesting account of the causes\r\nand varieties of the disease, and modifies his treatment accordingly.\r\nHe recommends bleeding from the basilic vein, to be repeated if\r\ncircumstances require, purging with gentle laxatives, such as myrobalans\r\nand rhubarb, giving demulcents, such as gum arabic and starch, to which\r\npoppy is sometimes to be added, for allaying irritation. He directs the\r\nbath, strong exercise, and vociferation to be avoided. When the disease\r\narises from a cold cause (he means in cases of passive hemorrhage), he\r\nforbids venesection, and recommends stimulants, such as frankincense and\r\nmyrrh. In certain cases he allows astringents, such as alum, balaustine,\r\ngalls, sumach, &c. He also directs us to apply to the breast an\r\nastringent cerate containing roses, plantain, purslain, &c. Alsaharavius\r\nrecommends bleeding, cold applications to the chest, opiates, and\r\nastringents, according to circumstances. Rhases states that opium, by\r\nthickening or congealing the blood, proves useful in hemoptysis. He\r\napproves very much of a milk-diet. In general he recommends venesection.\r\nHe directs the physician to be at pains to ascertain from what part the\r\nblood proceeds.\r\n\r\nCold applications to the chest are not now generally resorted to in this\r\ndisease, although it will be seen that the ancient authorities generally\r\napprove of this practice. It will be remarked, however, that Galen\r\ncondemns the indiscriminate use of this remedy; and Rhases also states\r\nthat he had seen mischief produced by the unseasonable application of\r\ncold to the chest. In short, like every other mode of practice, it ought,\r\nno doubt, to be applied with proper caution and discrimination.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXII.—ON EMPYEMA AND PHTHISIS.\r\n\r\nEmpyema is formed either in the cavities of the chest, or in the pleura,\r\nsometimes arising from vomiting of blood, when the ulcer has not healed\r\n(in which case phthisis soon comes on, provided the discharge came from\r\nthe lungs), and sometimes from a precursory inflammation, which has\r\nformed into an abscess and burst (as is sometimes the case in pleurisy),\r\nor from a defluxion from the head. The symptoms of a confirmed empyema\r\nare weight in the chest, an intense dry cough, with pain, and sometimes\r\nwith a fluid, in which case they seem to experience an alleviation. At\r\nthe commencement the attacks of fever are weak, irregular, and difficult\r\nto perceive; but when the abscess is about to burst, they have more\r\nviolent fever, attended with rigor, and in speaking their breathing is\r\nobstructed. When the abscess bursts, matter is brought up, sometimes\r\npure and sometimes feculent: sometimes it is discharged upwards, when\r\nit is attended with more danger; and sometimes downwards, in which case\r\nthe matter is partly translated to the stomach and bowels; and partly to\r\nthe bladder, the metastasis taking place by certain vessels. All along\r\nthey have hectic fever until the ulcer becomes clean; and if this do\r\nnot speedily take place, the empyema is converted into phthisis from\r\nthe lungs undergoing ulceration. When this takes place, the cheeks are\r\nlivid; there are copious sweats about the forehead and neck; the flesh\r\nis melted, the nails bent, and they appear glossy, white, or pale. When\r\nthe disease gains ground, the bowels become loose, the hypochondria are\r\nretracted; for the most part thirst and a loathing of food oppress them;\r\nand the expectoration is very fetid.\r\n\r\n_The cure._ Our first object, therefore, ought to be to assist the\r\nconcoction of the abscess, which may be attempted by fomenting with\r\nsponges, and applying cataplasms made of barley-flour, with dried figs\r\nboiled, some rosin, pigeon’s dung, nitre, and mallows. The rupture of\r\nthe abscess is promoted by lying upon the side which is not affected.\r\nLet them drink at intervals honied water, and the juice of ptisan with\r\nhoney. Those who are stronger may likewise drink the decoction of hyssop\r\nand thyme with honey. Eating pickles also forwards the breaking of the\r\nabscess, and likewise the pills from the colocynth hiera, taken at\r\nbedtime. When the pus begins to be discharged, give again the decoction\r\nof hyssop, iris, and liquorice boiled in honied water, or liquorice\r\ntriturated with sesame; and apply a cataplasm of fine flour, boiled in\r\nhonied water and oil. When the ulceration is difficult to cleanse, we\r\nmust use the compound remedies, such as that from horehound, either\r\nthe simple or the compound one; that from tares; and those called\r\ndodecatheon, and the medicine named from Philoxenus. When it is converted\r\ninto phthisis, we may give the headed leek, dissolved in draughts\r\nof chondrus or ptisan, and let them be twice boiled, and given by\r\nthemselves. Let the water which is drunk be rain, and honied water made\r\nfrom it. At the beginning of the remissions apply cataplasms of linseed\r\nand fine flour, with the decoction of fenugreek, or mallows, oil, honey,\r\nand the leaves of marshmallows. In process of time we may have recourse\r\nto cerates, such as those from butter, oil of privet, oil of bays,\r\nand iris. The plaster of Mnasæus is also to be used. When there is a\r\ndefluxion upon the chest, that made of willows may be applied to it. They\r\nmay also take the simple propoma, mentioned already for empyema, and some\r\nof the compound ones. When a violent cough prevails, mix thyme and hyssop\r\nalong with the juice of liquorice, in well boiled honey; and, having\r\nformed them properly, give to be retained under the tongue. The antidote\r\nof Mithridates, at intervals, will likewise suit with them, as also that\r\nfrom vipers. But the best remedy is the Armenian bole taken in a draught,\r\nand the antidote _esdra_ is not at all inferior to those aforesaid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY.

When a collection of pus is suspected, he directs us to\r\nshake the patient, when a peculiar sound will be heard if there be fluid\r\nin the chest. And here, by the way, we may mention that Laennec gives\r\nHippocrates great credit for his diagnostic talent in this case. It is\r\nin pneumothorax that succussion is applicable as a test of fluid being\r\nconfined in the chest. In that case, he directs us to make an incision\r\ninto the chest; in other words, he recommends paracentesis thoracis,\r\nan operation revived of late years, but with very equivocal results.\r\nHippocrates, however, restricted the operation to those cases in which\r\nthere is protrusion of the collected fluid. (Aff. Int. xxv.) It would\r\nappear, from one of his Aphorisms, that the pus was let out either by\r\na cutting instrument or the cautery. (vii, 43.) In his Prognostics, he\r\npronounces a falling out of the hairs and a diarrhœa to be fatal symptoms\r\nin phthisis. He gives a very striking description of confirmed empyema.\r\n(Prognost. 17.) His account of the formation of hydrothorax (Affect. Int.\r\nxxv.) has also been highly commended by the great master of auscultation.\r\nAccording to Hippocrates, phthisis is most common between the ages of\r\neighteen and thirty-six. (Aphor. v, 9.)\r\n\r\nAretæus gives a good description of the phenomena attending empyema\r\nthoracis. He says that when the abscess points outwardly, it separates\r\nthe ribs from one another to make room for itself. It is occasioned, he\r\nsays, by inflammation with a collection of blood. But the most graphic\r\ndelineation of the phenomena of disease to be found in the whole records\r\nof medicine is that which he draws of a patient in the last stage of\r\nconsumption. We will not mar it by attempting a copy which would fall\r\nso short of the original. He does not approve of the common tests, as\r\nrecommended by Hippocrates; and, instead of forming an opinion of the\r\ncase by throwing the sputa upon fire or water, he prudently directs us\r\nto judge of the case from the general symptoms. Unfortunately only a\r\nfragment of the chapter on the treatment has come down to us. It appears\r\nfrom it that he approved of a milk-diet and a sea-voyage. In cases of\r\nempyema he states that the matter sometimes forms a communication with\r\nthe windpipe, and is evacuated in that way, and sometimes it is carried\r\noff by the urinary passages.\r\n\r\nCelsus recommends in particular a sea-voyage, change of air, gestation in\r\na couch, and a milk-diet. He cautions against the bath and exposure to\r\nthe sun or cold. When other means do not effect a cure, he directs us to\r\nburn the chest in different places with the actual cautery, so as to form\r\nissues. See a strong recommendation of this practice in Caillot (Elemens\r\nde Physiologie, p. 6.)\r\n\r\nGalen has detailed the principles upon which phthisis ought to be treated\r\nin the fifth book of the ‘Meth. Med.’ He commends strongly a diet of\r\nmilk, especially that of goats, which is, he says, of an intermediate\r\nconsistence between the milk of cows and of asses. The ancients, he\r\nsays, made consumptive patients suck a woman. Whatever kind be used, he\r\nrecommends it to be drunk as soon as it is milked from the animal; and\r\nhe further directs sometimes honey or a little salt to be added to it.\r\nAccording to Galen, portions of the lungs are sometimes brought up in the\r\nsputa. (Loc. Affec. iv.) Cælius Aurelianus also confirms this statement.\r\n(Tard. Pass. ii, 14.) Aretæus, Alexander, and Leo further say that\r\nportions of the bronchia have been brought up with the expectoration.\r\n\r\nAlexander gives very judicious directions for the choice of milk, and\r\ntreats of empyema otherwise very fully. He says, when pus is collected in\r\nthe chest, the sound of it may be heard in succussions of the body.\r\n\r\nAëtius states, upon the authority of Archigenes, that in certain cases\r\nempyema is formed without fever. This is now well ascertained to be the\r\ncase. He approves of the cautery, like Celsus. His account of phthisis is\r\ntaken from Galen.\r\n\r\nCælius gives many important observations on the proper treatment\r\nof consumption, and strictures on the practice of the other sects.\r\nHe remarks that in old coughs attended with fever, although the\r\nexpectoration be at first transparent and not purulent, the complaint\r\noften terminates in phthisis. His description of the disease is\r\nsingularly accurate. The pectoral _râle_ he notices in these words:\r\n“Quosdam etiam sibilatio vel stridor thoracis sequitur.” The pulse is\r\nsaid to be “debilis, densus ac deinde formicalis.” He mentions that\r\nit usually terminates by a colliquative diarrhœa. His treatment is\r\njudiciously suited to the circumstances of the case. He condemns the\r\nearly use of the bath, hellebore, and the formation of issues on the part\r\naffected. Of the varieties of empyema he has treated elsewhere at great\r\nlength. He appears to consider the operation of paracentesis as dangerous.\r\n\r\nMany of the remedies recommended by Marcellus contain a combination of\r\nstimulant with narcotic substances, that is to say, of myrrh, storax, and\r\nthe like, with opium and hyoscyamus.\r\n\r\nPliny speaks of navigation, that is to say, a sea-voyage, as a popular\r\nremedy for phthisis in his time. (H. N. xxxi, 33.)\r\n\r\nVegetius, the veterinary surgeon, remarks that _tubercles like boils_\r\nform in the lungs of cattle. (Mulom. ii, 45.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna’s treatment is in general like that of Galen and his followers.\r\nHe speaks of inhaling the vapours of arsenic, pine-fruit, &c. He and\r\nhis countryman Avenzoar approve of paracentesis and the cautery. Mesue\r\nrecommends the tepid bath in the decline of phthisis. Serapion approves\r\nof opening the abscess in cases of empyema by means of a red-hot iron. In\r\nthe treatment of empyema Haly Abbas appears to have put great confidence\r\nin absorbent earths, such as burnt crabs, gum Arabic, Cyprian earth,\r\n&c. He gives the milk of asses in the morning, and at night the syrup\r\nof poppies. He also praises goats’ milk. He approves of a milk-diet\r\nand demulcents likewise in phthisis. He makes frequent mention of\r\npoppies, doubtless with the view of alleviating the cough. In certain\r\ncases he prescribes the tepid bath; and, under proper regulations, we\r\nare convinced that it might often be of service. Haly approves of the\r\ntests of purulent expectoration, which we have stated above that Aretæus\r\ncondemned. Alsaharavius says that the bath may prove useful in phthisis,\r\nbut that it ought not to be tried except under the direction of a skilful\r\nphysician. He seems to direct the patient first to use the tepid bath\r\nin a warm place, and afterwards to go for a short time into a cold\r\nbath. He does not explain the principles of his practice. He approves\r\nin general of a milk-diet, but directs us to change it if a diarrhœa\r\ncome on. The milk of asses or of goats is what he prefers. He approves\r\nof the Hippocratic tests of pus. Rhases describes several species of\r\nconsumption. One of them he represents as being seated in the trachea.\r\nHis account of the various modes of treatment is most ample. He strongly\r\ncommends the milk of asses.\r\n\r\nGalen, Rhases, and most of the ancient authorities held that consumption\r\nis contagious. See, further, Aristotle (Prob. 7), and Isocrates (Æginet.)\r\nAlexander Aphrodisiensis accounts for the propagation of the disease by\r\nsupposing that putrid matter is conveyed from the lungs of the affected\r\nperson to others. (Prob. ii, 42.)\r\n\r\nThe historian Sallust uses the word _tabes_ as synonymous with\r\n_contagium_, in the following sentence: “Tanta vis morbi, uti tabes,\r\nplerosque civium animos invaserat.” (Catalin. 36.) Livy does the same in\r\nseveral places. (See ii, 23.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXIII.—ON PLEURISY.\r\n\r\nPleurisy, properly so called, is an inflammation of the membrane which\r\nlines the ribs, and is attended with difficulty of breathing, cough,\r\ncontinual fever, and pain shooting to the clavicle and hypochondrium.\r\nYou may distinguish pleurisy from inflammation of the liver (for in it\r\nthere are all these symptoms), by the pain in pleurisy being pungent, and\r\nthe cough being sometimes without expectoration (when it indicates that\r\nthe disease is not yet concocted), and sometimes with expectoration, the\r\nappearance of which indicates the nature of the humour that occasions the\r\ncomplaint; for it is red and tinged with blood when a fulness of blood is\r\nthe cause; yellow and palish when caused by yellow bile; white and frothy\r\nwhen from phlegm; and blackish when from the melancholic humour. And the\r\npulse is hard and serrated. But, in inflammation of the liver, the pain\r\nis not pungent, nor is the pulse so hard; and the cough throughout is dry\r\nand without expectoration, and the face appears paler. Pleurisies from\r\ninflammation of the external muscles (which are not, properly speaking,\r\npleurisies) are not accompanied with cough and expectoration, nor is\r\nthe pulse hard; and if one touch the part affected with his hand, the\r\npatients feel pain; and if not resolved, the swelling is converted into\r\npus, which may be evacuated externally by an incision; whereas pleurisy\r\nfrom inflammation of the membrane which lines the chest has not this\r\ntermination; for if it do not discharge the empyema either internally or\r\nexternally, it terminates in peripneumonia.\r\n\r\n_The cure._ If the pain shoot to the clavicle, we must straightway open\r\na vein; or if to the hypochondrium, we must purge downwards. Physicians\r\nof late, in all cases, have recourse to venesection, apprehending,\r\nI suppose, the disturbance occasioned by purging. When the strength\r\nprevents us from having recourse to either of these remedies, we must use\r\nstimulant clysters; and if the pain is moderate, after the clyster we\r\nmay give honied water, and the juice of ptisan and of chondrus. When the\r\naffection is on the decline, we may add to the juices leeks or calamint,\r\nand the patient may get the seeds of pennyroyal and nettle, with honey,\r\nas a linctus. When the pains are violent after the evacuation, they\r\nmust be soothed by the application of hot wool, or of sulphurated wool;\r\nor by fomentations of millet and flour in a bag, or by means of hot\r\nwater or oil in a bladder. Unwashed wool may be applied with oil; and\r\nwine, containing an admixture of sea-water, or salt, may be added to\r\nit. Or we may apply a cataplasm, formed of the medicine from seeds,\r\nwith the decoction of chamomile and marshmallows, or of dried figs,\r\niris, wormwood, and some honey, with oil of nard. About the fourth day\r\ngive spoon-meats for food, with some honey; but after the seventh day\r\nwe are to give a linctus of almonds and nettle-seeds, triturated in\r\nhoney, or the linctus of butter and honey pounded together. And we are\r\nto use the hypoglottis (electuary) of boiled honey. And we must apply\r\nto the affected parts the fetid epitheme—that from sweet marjoram, and\r\nthe rue-plaster. The bulbi, applied with axunge, are often an effectual\r\nremedy, and they may also be administered in a clyster with butter\r\nand turpentine. Among the most powerful remedies is the linctus from\r\npine-nuts and bitter almonds, linseed, pitch-fruit, and starch, in equal\r\nparts, with honey. When they are troubled with insomnolency, it will be\r\nproper to give a linctus of poppy-heads; and we may use the antidote\r\ncalled athanasia, and those prepared for this purpose. When the disease\r\nremains after the fourteenth day, we must cup them, and keep them upon a\r\nspare diet; and then, when the disease is on the decline, we may make\r\nthem take the bath (but avoiding the cold), and allow them to use a more\r\nnutritious diet. If the inflammation of the pleura be not resolved, but\r\nappear to be converted into pus, we must have recourse to the remedies\r\nformerly mentioned.\r\n\r\n_For pains of the sides without fever._ Pains of the sides without\r\nfever are cured by bdellium and costus, mixed with the ashes of burnt\r\ncabbage-leaves and tallow: for this remedy is powerfully discutient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY.

He says, those who have neither been bled nor purged\r\ndie on the seventh day, either with delirium, or with orthopnœa and a\r\nrâle. One of his aphorisms is, that pneumonia supervening upon pleurisy\r\nis dangerous. (vii, 11.) He was acquainted with pulmonary adhesions, as\r\nis remarked by his devoted admirer Laennec.\r\n\r\nAretæus, with his usual accuracy, gives a most complete description of\r\nall the symptoms of pleurisy, but, as it is not much different from\r\nour author’s, we shall not enter far upon a detail of it. He states\r\ndistinctly that the disease is an inflammation of the membrane which\r\nlines the chest. The sputa are pituitous, bilious, or deeply saturated\r\nwith blood, or yellowish. He remarks, by the way, that pleurisy is\r\nsometimes a sporadic disease, and sometimes epidemical. His directions\r\nabout the application of the common remedies are dictated by his usual\r\nexcellent judgment. On the necessity of early and repeated venesection\r\nhe insists strongly, but recommends it not to be carried the length of\r\nproducing deliquium animi, as the fluids will thereby be determined\r\ninwardly. Archigenes (ap. Aëtium) and other ancient authorities joined\r\nhim in this rule of practice, although in opposition to Hippocrates. He\r\napproves of cupping the side, but not until after the seventh day, and\r\ndirects us to apply to the scarifications salts or nitre. His internal\r\nremedies consist of demulcents, diluents, and narcotics, varied according\r\nto circumstances. He forbids the use of cold drink and cold air. Celsus\r\nalso cautions against cold, and directs sinapisms to the chest. His\r\ngeneral treatment is nothing different from that of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\nGalen treats of pleurisy cursorily in many parts of his works, but, as\r\nhe follows entirely the views of Hippocrates, we need not enter into a\r\ndetail of his practice. We may mention, however, that the worst character\r\nof the pulse, according to him, is when it is hard, small, and very\r\nfrequent. (Diff. Puls. iv, 5.)\r\n\r\nAëtius gives an interesting account of a species of pleurisy arising\r\nfrom indigestion or crudities of the stomach. In this case he forbids\r\nvenesection, and recommends clysters and calefacient applications.\r\n\r\nAlexander gives very minute directions how to distinguish pleurisy\r\nfrom hepatitis. He remarks that, in the latter disease, the patient is\r\nyellowish: in the former the pulse is hard and serrated. When the pain\r\nis not violent, he recommends us to trust to cupping, which he says was\r\na popular remedy in Armenia. He disapproves in general of opiates. When\r\nthe discharges from the bowels are bilious, he directs purging with\r\nscammony, black hellebore, and the like. According to Actuarius, the\r\nurine in pleurisy is first reddish, and afterwards becomes red and of a\r\ndark wine colour. (De Urinis, vii, 9.) The sputa, he says, in pleurisy\r\nand pneumonia, is of a whitish and bloody colour. (De Diagnos. i, 16.)\r\n\r\nPsellus cautions us not to confound pleurisy with abscess of the side.\r\nIn the latter case, he remarks, there is no cough, and pain is felt upon\r\npressure. He appears to copy from Paulus.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing particularly original in the accounts given of it\r\nby Oribasius, Nonnus, Octavius, and Marcellus. We shall, therefore,\r\nproceed to explain the views of the Methodists. The remedies recommended\r\nby Cælius Aurelianus are, upon the whole, nearly the same as those\r\ndirected by the other sects, but he attaches much importance to his own\r\nmethod of applying them. In illustration of his principles, we shall\r\nmention a few of his strictures upon the practice of the others. He\r\ncondemns Hippocrates for carrying venesection the length of producing\r\ndeliquium animi, which he pronounces to be a very pernicious practice.\r\nIndiscriminate purging, he thinks, increases irritation. He disapproves\r\nof abstinence for seven days, as enjoined by the father of medicine.\r\nDiocles he blames for enjoining the same rules with regard to bleeding\r\nand purging, and for allowing cold food in summer. Praxagoras he strongly\r\nand properly condemns for giving pepper or southernwood in mulse; and\r\nalso for recommending the warm bath, and fomentations to the side,\r\nwhich he justly remarks will only occasion cold to the patient; and for\r\nprohibiting venesection, when the disease is occasioned by cold, and the\r\npatient is old and weak. He finds fault with Asclepiades for saying that\r\nvenesection is not proper in certain countries, as at Rome and Athens,\r\nwhereas Cælius properly maintains that venesection is everywhere proper.\r\nIt is worthy of remark, by the way, that prejudices against bleeding\r\nprevailed in Rome when Galen wrote, and to a certain extent do so still.\r\nCælius also justly condemns his too free allowance of mulse, or wine and\r\nhoney. He blames Themison for using acrid applications to the chest. Of\r\nhis strictures on the treatment of Heraclides, the most just are his\r\ncondemnation of the practice of giving mulse with rue, and garlic with\r\nvinegar, to remove the nausea; and of his direction to bleed only on the\r\nsecond day after two or three clysters had been given.\r\n\r\nOf the practice of the Arabians little need be said, as their views of\r\ntreatment are entirely conformable to those of the Greeks. Avicenna’s\r\ndirections are most minute, and would furnish an excellent guide to\r\npractice. He forbids cold things, and approves of cupping and sinapisms\r\nonly when the disease does not yield to the ordinary treatment. When\r\ninsomnolency continues long, he permits to give the syrup of poppies.\r\nConvalescents are directed to avoid saltish and sharp things, repletion,\r\nthe sun, wind, smoke, loud talking, and the like. Serapion, on the fourth\r\nday, adds liquorice to the decoction of barley. Mesue and Avicenna agree\r\nin opinion, that fomentations to the side do no good unless in slight\r\ncases, and when applied early. Mesue forbids cupping until the seventh\r\nday; and, when the stomach and bowels are loaded, he opens the bowels\r\nbefore bleeding. Haly Abbas directs bleeding from the arm opposite\r\nthe side affected, at first; but, if the disease is protracted, from\r\nthe arm of the same side. He recommends gentle laxatives, and, after\r\nbleeding and purging, warm applications to the side, such as a bladder\r\nhalf filled with hot water. He also speaks of cupping, and of stimulant\r\nplasters, sinapisms, and such like. He says, when the body is cleansed,\r\nand the disease matured, the patient is to be put into a tepid bath. This\r\npractice may deserve consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that the Arabians in general bleed from the arm of\r\nthe opposite side. The Greek and Latin authorities are divided in opinion\r\nupon this rule of practice. Hippocrates, Galen, and Celsus recommend us\r\nto bleed from the arm of the affected side; but Aretæus, Aëtius, and\r\nCælius Aurelianus, from the opposite. Galen, in one place, mentions that\r\nhe had abstracted blood in a case of pleurisy by opening one of the\r\narteries of the hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXIV.—ON AFFECTIONS OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nWhen the heart itself is primarily affected, the case is far beyond all\r\nmedical aid, occasioning sudden death; and so also in the inflammations\r\nand erysipelas of it, strong distemperatures in very acute fevers, and\r\nhemorrhages when it is wounded, especially in the left ventricle. When\r\nit is affected sympathetically with the brain, the liver, the orifice\r\nof the stomach, and from sorrow, fear, and many other causes, it brings\r\non the affection called syncope, being a sudden collapse of the vital\r\npowers, indicated by prostration of strength, deliquium animi, a small\r\npulse, coldness of the extremities, and copious perspiration. When\r\nthis affection is of a violent nature, it also is irremediable; but\r\nif the strength stands out, it may sometimes be relieved. But strong\r\npalpitations of the heart often arise from a fulness or effervescence\r\nof its blood. When, therefore, the heart is over-heated, it renders the\r\nrespiration large and dense; but when it is too cold, the respiration is\r\nsmall and rare. The complete cure of syncope of the heart, when it occurs\r\namong the symptoms of fever, we have treated of in the Second Book.\r\nThis only may now be added, that when the collapse gains ground after\r\nfriction and ointments have been applied to the extremities, and after\r\npurification of the floor, and other cooling means, we must sprinkle upon\r\nthe parts of the body which are sweating powdered myrtle, Cimolian earth,\r\nor amber, or pomegranate-rind with manna, or Samian earth with gum; and\r\ncataplasms of mustard or pellitory, or adarce, are to be applied to the\r\ncold extremities, as far as to the groins and armpits. The food should\r\nbe bread out of water, or out of cold diluted wine, swines’ feet and the\r\njoints and snout, and fowls; all the things being given in a cold state.\r\nOn the head and forehead is to be rubbed the juice of unripe olives, or\r\nsome astringent application, with gum, and the decoction of roses; and a\r\ncataplasm is to be applied to the hypochondria and stomach, formed from\r\ndates, roses, the flower of the wild vine, acacia, hypocistis, and alum.\r\n\r\n_On palpitation of the heart._ “I knew a certain person,” says Galen,\r\n“who suffered an attack of palpitation of the heart every year in the\r\nseason of spring. Wherefore, having for three years experienced benefit\r\nfrom venesection, in the fourth he anticipated the attack by getting\r\nbled, and escaped from it, and did so for many years afterwards, using at\r\nthe same time a suitable diet. And yet even he died before attaining old\r\nage, as every other person in this complaint does, some being suddenly\r\ncut off in acute fevers by syncope; but some of them without syncope,\r\nbeing unexpectedly deprived of life, as if by apoplexy. The majority of\r\nthose who are thus affected do not reach the fiftieth year of age, but\r\npass the fortieth.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Galen (de Loc. Affect.); Aëtius (viii, 58); Oribasius\r\n(Synops. ix, 6); Actuarius (Meth. Med. iv, 3); Leo (iv, 21); Nonnus\r\n(134); Avicenna (iii, 11, 12); Serapion (ii, 27); Avenzoar, (1, 12);\r\nMesue (de Ægrit. Pect.); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix, 22, and Pract. vi, 16);\r\nAlsaharavius (Pract. xiii); Rhases (Divis. i, 58, and Contin. xvi.)\r\n\r\nMost of the knowledge which the ancients possessed of these obscure\r\ncomplaints may be found in Galen (l. c.) In the body of a monkey he\r\nhad remarked hydrops pericardii, and in that of a cock he had detected\r\na scirrhous tumour, from which he inferred that these diseases occur\r\nalso in the human subject. One would almost suspect, however, that the\r\nancients were more familiar with _inspectiones cadaverum_ than they chose\r\nto avow. As a proof of this, we may mention what is related by Hesychius\r\nof Hermogenes the rhetorician: “Hermogenes the rhetorician having died\r\nwas dissected, and his heart was found covered with hair, and greatly\r\nexceeding its natural size.” (See also Suidas.) Respecting persons\r\nhaving hair on their hearts we quote the following note from Fabricius\r\n(Bibliotheca Græca, iv, 429): “Plura exempla hominum quorum cor pilosum\r\nest repertum collegit elegantissimus. Muretus (xii, 10, Var. Lect.);\r\nPontanus (Bellar. Attic. 301), et Alexander Tassonus in libro Italicè\r\nedito cui titulus Pensieri Diversi, (vi, 30.) De Aristomene Messenio idem\r\ntradit præter alios Dio. Chrysost. (xxxv, 430) de Leonida Plutarchus in\r\nparallelis minoribus (306.)” It is proper to mention, however, that Senac\r\nis incredulous as to the truth of these stories (Essai, &c. 62.) On the\r\nsubject we are treating of the learned Stephen Bernard has the following\r\nremark: “Apparet, ni fallor, ex hoc loco Pauli (iii, 68), veteres\r\nmorborum sedes in cadaveribus rimari non neglexisse quod etiam patet ex\r\nillis quæ de hepatis inflammatione habet (181), qui enim scire poterant\r\naliquando partem ejus cavam, nonnunquam vero gibbam inflammatione tentari\r\nnisi ex cadaverum inspectione?” (Ad Nonni Epit. 208.) See also Pliny\r\n(Hist. Nat. xi, 70), and the note of Harduin.\r\n\r\nSince all the writers subsequent to Galen merely copy from him, we need\r\nnot say more of their opinions. We may state, however, what Actuarius\r\nsays regarding the characters of the urine in affections of the heart.\r\nIn hot intemperaments of the organ the urine at first is more acrid and\r\nthinner, but as the disorder increases, it assumes an oily colour and\r\nconsistence. The sediments become grumous, furfuraceous, scaly, and\r\ngritty. When it is affected with a cold intemperament, the colour of\r\nthe urine is whiter, and the sediment at first moderate and crude, but\r\nafterwards it becomes black. (De Urin. vii, 4.)\r\n\r\nThe Arabians, especially Avicenna, treat of these complaints at great\r\nlength, but without supplying much additional information. Avenzoar\r\nspeaks obscurely of certain tumours resembling pellicles or cartilages\r\non the pericardium. He mentions also hydrops pericardii, and abscess\r\nof the same. Pain of the heart, says Haly Abbas, may arise from an\r\nintemperament, organic disease, or a solution of continuity. The last\r\ntwo causes soon occasion death. He mentions that palpitation may be\r\noccasioned by dropsy of the pericardium. He recommends bleeding in\r\ncases of palpitation, upon the authority of Galen, and also things of\r\na cold nature, such as seeds of cucumbers, citrons, gourds, roses, and\r\ncamphor. Alsaharavius gives a similar account of these affections. Rhases\r\nalso approves of venesection and cold applications. He mentions that\r\npalpitation is sometimes felt in the region of the stomach, for which he\r\nrecommends bitters, such as wormwood.\r\n\r\nThe disease which Galen and his followers describe under the name of\r\npalpitation was no doubt that state of the heart now called hypertrophy\r\nwith dilatation. In confirmation of the truth of Galen’s prognosis,\r\nwe may quote the words of the celebrated translator of Laennec, as to\r\nthe issue of the disease of the heart we have mentioned: “Such persons\r\nhowever are marked for destruction. After a certain time the disease\r\nobtains the mastery, and brings the strong man down, the sooner, alas!\r\nfor the bold resistance made to his dominion.” (English Translation of\r\nLaennec, p. 62.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXV.—ON AFFECTIONS OF THE BREASTS.\r\n\r\nAfter childbirth, the milk frequently being converted into cheese in the\r\nbreasts, produces inflammations. Wherefore at first we may use these\r\napplications: Having squeezed a soft sponge out of tepid oxycrate, apply\r\nit to the breasts, and bind it on in the proper form; or use dates\r\ntriturated in oxycrate with bread, or a whole egg with rose-oil and some\r\ncerate; or alum, fleawort, with coriander and purslain, may be applied in\r\nthe form of a cataplasm; or apply the firestone triturated with cerate,\r\nand bind it on. When there is distension or thrombus in the part, apply\r\na cataplasm of bread with water and honey, or with wine and honey; or\r\nbread with the green herb perdicias (_pellitory of the wall?_), along\r\nwith cerate twice a-day; or bean-flour with hydromel, or sodden must. But\r\nif they cannot bear the weight we must use an embrocation of hot sweet\r\noil by means of soft wool. But we must foment them with the steam of hot\r\nwater, or a decoction of fenugreek, or of marshmallows, or of linseed.\r\nAnd we are to apply to them a cataplasm made of fine flour with linseed,\r\nor fenugreek with hydromel, or sesame with honey, or pounded butter. But\r\nwe must interdict sucking of the breasts, because it only attracts more\r\nmilk to them. When the inflammation is on the decline we may apply the\r\nfollowing cerates: Boil beet in oil until it is softened, throw it away,\r\nbut add to the oil a moderate quantity of wax, and use.—_Another_: Mix\r\nthe red parts of ten raw eggs in a cerate consisting of wax, oz. iiss,\r\nand of rose-oil, oz. iv; stir with a spatula, and add as much salt water\r\nas it can receive, and then again stir with a spatula, and use. For\r\nhardness of the breasts, the composition from honey is applicable, and\r\nall emollient applications. When the swelling is converted into pus, we\r\nmust use those applications which have been mentioned for parotis, and\r\nthose that will be mentioned afterwards for apostemes.\r\n\r\n_From Archigenes, for spreading ulcers of the breasts attended with\r\nmalignity._ Of good Adriatic wine, xx sextarii; of the sumach, lb. j;\r\nof cypress balls, lb. j; of black galls, called _omphacitæ_, oz. vj; of\r\ncassia, oz. vj; when bruised, macerate in wine for ten days, then boil\r\ndown to one half, stirring with a cypress spatula; then throw away the\r\nherbs; and when the juice is boiled to the consistence of honey, lay it\r\nup in a glass vessel. Use it for spreading ulcers, undiluted, or, if it\r\nis too thick, let it be diluted with wine. It is so made as to apply to\r\nspreading ulcers in the breasts, to runnings of the ears, foul defluxions\r\nfrom the gums, and dysentery. When diluted with milk it acts as a\r\nparegoric in soothing pain. Other kinds of ulceration of the breasts must\r\nbe treated like ulcers in general.\r\n\r\n_Preservatives of the breasts._ Having pounded cumin with water, apply\r\nto the nipples, then lay upon the breasts a sponge squeezed out of\r\noxymel, and bind it with a bandage. After three days, having taken away\r\nthe cumin, put on a cataplasm of the bulbous roots of the lily upon the\r\nnipples, and having bandaged it let it remain again for three days, and\r\ndo the same three times a month.—_Another_: Apply powdered hemlock for\r\nnine days, and the sponge externally, as mentioned above; and after an\r\ninterval of a few days repeat the same. The rubbings from the Naxian\r\nwhetstone act as a preservative of the breasts of virgins.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY.

Aëtius,\r\nhowever, has treated of these complaints more fully than any other\r\nauthor. He gives from Philumenus various prescriptions for inflamed\r\nbreasts, the most important ingredients in which seem to be ceruse and\r\nlitharge, with wax or honey. One of them also contains the recent leaves\r\nof henbane, evidently for the purpose of allaying pain. For indurated\r\nmammæ he directs linseed, or the seed of fenugreek with hydromel to be\r\napplied. In short, his applications and our author’s are very similar.\r\nHe describes a certain induration of the mamma under the name of\r\n_chondriasis_. This affection is alluded to by Aristotle (H. A. vi, 20.)\r\nWhen an abscess forms, he recommends us to open it and evacuate the pus.\r\nNonnus, as usual, copies from our author.\r\n\r\nAvicenna treats fully of these complaints, but his remedies are mostly\r\nborrowed from the Greeks. The most simple of his applications for\r\napostemes of the breasts is a sponge squeezed out of tepid vinegar\r\nand water. Haly Abbas recommends the same, or a plaster of the oil of\r\nroses, bread, and the yelk of an egg. When suppuration is expected, he\r\ndirects us to apply a cataplasm of figs. Alsaharavius treats minutely of\r\nthis subject. When pain of the breast arises from coagulated milk, he\r\nrecommends a piece of cloth soaked in warm water or vinegar. When milk\r\ncannot be extracted from the breasts, he directs them to be sucked by\r\nmeans of a suitable instrument shaped like a nipple. To dispel coagulated\r\nmilk Rhases recommends a mixture of hot vinegar and rose-oil. He also\r\nrecommends a composition of mint and common salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT.

(xii, 26); Alsaharavius (Pract. xv); Rhases (ad Mansor. v, 51,\r\nand Contin. xxxvi.)\r\n\r\nAll the authorities concur in recommending for the cure of this\r\ncomplaint, a combination of astringents with aromatics. They therefore\r\ndirect us to mix alum with storax, myrrh, and the like. Rhases recommends\r\ntutty with rose-water and camphor, and also various astringent and\r\nodoriferous liniments. The plan of treatment directed by Alsaharavius\r\nis deserving of attention. He recommends purging with the hiera picra.\r\nAlsaharavius further recommends a bath in which mint, marjoram, centaury,\r\nspikenard, and the like have been boiled. The part is afterwards to be\r\nrubbed with an ointment, consisting of litharge or tutty, mixed with\r\nalum, myrrh, &c. in fragrant wine.\r\n\r\nThe ancients believed that living freely upon figs rendered the\r\nperspiration fetid. Eustathius, the commentator on Homer, makes mention\r\nof two Sophists, called Anchimolus and Mochus, who lived solely upon figs\r\nfor food, and water for drink; and he adds that their perspiration was so\r\nfetid, that when in the bath everybody shunned them. (Ad Iliad. xiii, 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXVII.—ON AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH, OF THE HYPOCHONDRIA, AND OF\r\nTHE BELLY.\r\n\r\nThose complaints which occur in fevers, such as loathing of food,\r\nbulimia, the canine appetite, atony of the stomach, deliquium animi,\r\nthirst, hiccough, nausea, and syncope, have been treated of sufficiently\r\nin the Second Book, and it would be out of place to say more about\r\nthem. But inflammations of the orifice of the stomach and of the liver\r\nrequire the admixture of astringents; for, if treated by the relaxant\r\nmethod alone, it will prove dangerous. It will be necessary, then,\r\nwhether oil be affused on the part or a cataplasm be applied, to add\r\nsome of the astringents to it, such as wormwood or the nard ointment;\r\nor that of apples, or of quinces may be boiled in it. The following\r\nis a cerate which we frequently use: Of white wax, oz. j, (but if in\r\nsummer, dr. vij); of aloes and mastich, of each, dr. j; add of the oil\r\nof unripe olives, or of apples and of nard, when going to use it, as\r\nmuch as will be sufficient to give it consistence. Or, if the stomach\r\nrequire greater astringency, as not being able to retain the food, mix\r\nalso of oil of unripe olives, dr. j; or of the juice of wormwood an\r\nequal quantity; and, thirdly, of the juice of hypocistis, of wild vine,\r\nand of sumach. We must make the quantity of the cerate proportionate\r\nto the number of the other medicines. When the inflammation becomes\r\nprotracted and hard, we must apply more complicated remedies, containing\r\naromatic, emollient, and discutient ingredients, such as that prepared\r\nfrom melilot, the philagrianum, and the fragrant. And a necklace of green\r\njasper appended from the neck, so as to touch the stomach, is of great\r\nuse. In hot intemperaments of the stomach, or ardent affections of it\r\nwith prostration or deliquium animi, or anorexia from any other cause\r\nthan fever, give cold water with the juice of unripe grapes, or the\r\ndecoction of quinces, or of vine shoots, or the powdered seed of cucumber\r\nwith cold water. Apply to the stomach a bladder filled with cold water,\r\nor the shavings of gourd. And the pills called Adipsa are to be given,\r\nas described when treating of thirst. The following medicine is proper\r\nfor cooling and strengthening a watery stomach: Of green rose-leaves, dr.\r\nvj; of liquorice juice, dr. iv, mix with sweet wine, and make into an\r\nelectuary, to be allowed to melt under the tongue. When, on account of a\r\ngross phlegm, medicines are required to heat and incise it, the following\r\none will be useful: Of the rind of fennel-root, oz. ij; of vinegar, a\r\nsextarius and a half; of aloes, oz. iij; of honey, lb. iv; the roots\r\nbeing boiled in the vinegar, are to be squeezed out and thrown away,\r\nand honey being added, it is to be boiled to a proper consistence, and\r\nthen powdered aloes sprinkled upon it. Give three spoonfuls of it with\r\nwater. Some prepare it without the aloes. The composition from calamint\r\nis also proper for such cases. When the food turns acid on the stomach,\r\ngive in water for drink a drachm of coriander seed sprinkled upon it like\r\npolenta, or one spoonful of mastich, or two spoonfuls of the seed of the\r\nwhite lettuce. The following is a compound medicine: Of pepper, dr. j;\r\nof the seeds of dill, dr. iij; of cumin, dr. iv; triturate, and give at\r\nbedtime one spoonful in diluted wine. Those who form black bile, and\r\nhave the stomach inflated, may, during the exacerbations, apply to it\r\nsponges soaked in the strongest vinegar, after which, if the complaints\r\ncontinue, alum with pulverized copper may be added to honey, and applied.\r\nLet them drink the juice of endive, or let mint be sprinkled upon the\r\ndraught. When the stomach is inflated and distended, mix a moderate\r\nquantity of honey and pepper with the decoction of calamint, and give.\r\nFor subversion of the stomach, take of the juice of the kernels of the\r\nunripe pomegranate, p. iij; of the juice of mint, p. j; boil until it\r\nthicken, and give a mystrum (_two spoonfuls?_) of it before a meal.\r\n\r\n_For salivation of the stomach._ Rinse the mouth with vinegar of squills,\r\nthe sauce of pickled olives, or the decoction of the green leaves. Or a\r\nvery small quantity of the same may be swallowed. A still more effectual\r\nremedy is aloes dissolved in water. For those who cannot retain their\r\nfood (who were particularly called stomachics by the ancients), mix with\r\nhoney the flour of fenugreek and the dried seed of mallows in powder, and\r\napply. The cerate consisting of wax, the lees of oil of iris, and castor,\r\nis also proper.\r\n\r\n_On anorexia._ Anorexia is a loathing of food, either from the prevalence\r\nof an intemperament in the stomach, or a collection of humours. You\r\nmay know a hot intemperament by the thirst, by the fetid and feculent\r\neructations if compelled to take food, and from the circumstance that\r\ncold and intractable substances are most easily digested; and a cold by\r\nthe opposite, for they neither have thirst, nor can they endure cold\r\nthings, and they have sometimes acid eructations. Of those who have\r\nanorexia from humours, they who suffer from thin and sharp humours,\r\nhave gnawing pain at the stomach, and are more affected with nausea\r\nand thirst. When the humours become putrid, they sometimes have fever.\r\nWhen they suffer from thick and viscid humours, these for the most part\r\nneither occasion acute pain nor thirst, but the common symptom of all\r\nthese cases is nausea. Wherefore, if the humours are contained in the\r\ncavity of the stomach, they vomit them up; but, if they are absorbed and\r\ninfarcted in its coats, they have nausea only, but do not vomit, unless\r\nit be when they have taken food. Those, therefore, who have anorexia\r\nfrom a hot intemperament, should take cooling things for diet, more\r\nespecially such as are prepared from vinegar. Wherefore give them bread\r\nthat has been soaked in oxycrate, or oxycrate itself to drink, and\r\noxygal (vinegar and milk), and that which is called melca by the Romans\r\n(it is a condiment from milk), endive, lettuces, and sometimes cold\r\nwater: all these moderately, according to the degree of the prevailing\r\nintemperament; for the immoderate use of them is not only not beneficial,\r\nbut often renders the complaint utterly incurable. When the affection\r\nis connected with coldness, it is to be cured by the opposite remedies;\r\nwherefore give to drink old wine and prepared wine, hydrogarum, and the\r\ndecoction of anise, rue, and Macedonian parsley, and pepper, in hot\r\ncommon water; or the composition from the three peppers, or that from\r\ncalamint. You may give also the theriac from vipers, which is also not\r\ninapplicable to those who loathe food from a collection of humours.\r\nGarlic, both as food and as medicine, is applicable to them. When the\r\nanorexia proceeds from a collection of humours, you may evacuate such as\r\nare thin and sharp, either by vomiting or purging downwards, and they\r\nmay readily be made to vomit, by drinking beforehand tepid water, or\r\nhydromel diluted with a large quantity of water. But it will be better\r\nto give previously some moistening food, such as the juice of ptisan, or\r\nthe yelks of eggs. How to produce easy vomiting has been explained in the\r\nFirst Book. But if the patient be hard to make vomit, it will be better\r\nto determine the matter downwards, having previously diluted their system\r\nby means of plenty of mild food. The cathartic medicine may either be the\r\npicra from aloes, that from quinces, which also admits of scammony, or\r\nthat from rhodomel. If it be possible without the scammony to evacuate by\r\na large dose of aloes, it will be better, because the scammony is bad for\r\nthe stomach. When the anorexia proceeds from thick and viscid humours,\r\nyou may cure them by attenuating and incisive remedies, such as oxymel,\r\nand the preparations from it and brine, as capers, olives, mustard, and\r\nthe like. The remedies recommended for anorexia from a cold intemperament\r\nare not inapplicable to these, and more particularly after evacuation.\r\nYou may evacuate them by the oxymel called Julian. Externally you must\r\nuse those unguents and emollient ointments which have power to warm and\r\nstrengthen the stomach, such in particular as that from the unripe grape,\r\nthat called Marciatum, and all the common ointments; also such epithemes\r\nas the Baium, the fragrant, and the like. They ought particularly to have\r\nrecourse to exercises and friction. When dyspepsia and anorexia arise\r\nfrom a cold and liquid humour, or such an intemperament, the medicines\r\ncomposed from quinces will be applicable to them, I mean that called\r\nmeloplacuntion, that from the juice of apples, and that from the flesh\r\nof them, and that which is prepared from the citron. Also the malagmata\r\nor emollient unguents, such as the Marciatum, that from the juice of the\r\nunripe grape, the Baium, Polyarchium, and such like. When there is an\r\nulcer in the stomach or bowels, the patient must abstain from all acrid\r\nfood and drink, and use remedies of a soothing nature, such as draughts\r\nwithout oil, and those from starch, Samian earth, Lemnian earth, and\r\nmilk, or a small quantity of honey, so as to purge without griping. A\r\nconvenient epitheme is prepared from dates, the flour of quinces, and a\r\ncerate from quince-ointment, or rose-oil with ammoniac and frankincense;\r\nand also the epitheme of Nileus, the plaster from willows, and the\r\nIcesian may be used. You may know that an ulcer exists by blood, pus, or\r\nthe scabs of a sore being vomited up.\r\n\r\n_For those whose stomachs are enervated and in a state of atony, and who,\r\nfor that reason, do not digest their food, or vomit it up._ Of aloes,\r\nof masucha, of mastich, of storax, of each, oz. ij; of wormwood, oz.\r\niv; of the flowers of the wild vine, oz. iij; of Gleucine oil, oz. vj;\r\nof quince-ointment, oz. iij; of wine, q. s. Some also add of cyphi and\r\nroses, of each, oz. ij. These things, being powdered, are received upon\r\npurple or wool, and applied to the stomach. But some, by adding of wax,\r\noz. vj, make an epitheme of it.\r\n\r\n_For iliac affections of the stomach, that is, strong and spasmodic\r\npains._ The trochisk of the Amazonians is the best medicine in this case.\r\nAn account of it, and of the ingredients which enter into the composition\r\nof other compound remedies for the stomach, you will find in the last\r\nBook, where Compound Medicines are treated of.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Aretæus (Morb.

We shall, therefore, direct our\r\nattention principally to Celsus, and merely add a few remarks from the\r\nothers. The stomach, he says, is affected by great heat, inflation,\r\ninflammation, and ulceration; by phlegm or bile; and by resolution, which\r\nis a common and fatal complaint. Heat is to be cured by cold external\r\napplications, such as vinegar and roses, along with cold drink. Inflation\r\nwe shall see treated of in the next Section. Inflammation which is\r\nattended with pain is to be treated by rest, abstinence, sulphurated\r\nwool, and wormwood, when fasting. If attended with ardor, he prescribes\r\ncold and repellent applications, occasionally exercise, and a fuller\r\ndiet. Ulceration is to be cured by exercise, friction of the extremities,\r\nsmooth and glutinous food, and avoiding every thing that is acid and\r\nacrid. Redundance of phlegm is to be treated by emetics, exercise,\r\nfriction, hot drink, and hot food. When bile prevails he recommends\r\nlaxatives, potions of wormwood, gestation, or a sea-voyage; emetics,\r\nif they can be conveniently borne, and suitable food, so as to avoid\r\nindigestion. Resolution, he says, is a severe affection of the stomach,\r\nwhen it cannot retain the food, and the body wastes. The bath, he says,\r\nis useless, but exercise of the upper parts of the body peculiarly\r\nproper. He recommends pouring cold water on the stomach, swimming in the\r\nsame, and living on cold food, rather such as is difficult to digest than\r\nwhat will readily spoil on the stomach. Hence, he says, some digest beef.\r\nUndiluted austere wine, either cold or very hot, is proper. If there is\r\nvomiting with pain, he directs us to apply over the stomach, wool or\r\nsponge soaked in vinegar, or cold cataplasms; or, if the pain be more\r\nsevere, a cupping-instrument; then bread which has been steeped in cold\r\ndiluted wine is to be given. If this is not retained, some smooth article\r\nof food not disagreeable to the stomach is to be administered; and, if\r\nthis be not retained, a cupful of wine is to be taken every hour until\r\nthe stomach becomes settled. He also praises an acid mixture, containing\r\npomegranate, endive, &c.\r\n\r\nAretæus gives a lively description of the feelings of a dyspeptic. The\r\nstudent who, heedless of the allurements of the senses and of the ties of\r\nnature, follows his divine pursuits with indiscreet ardour, and neglects\r\nto take proper food and exercise, is said to be particularly liable\r\nto affection of the stomach. The cure, he says, is to be effected by\r\ngestation, vociferation, a suitable diet, and indulgence of the patient’s\r\ncaprices as far as possible. Wormwood, ginger, aloes, and mastich are\r\nalso proper.\r\n\r\nAlexander properly remarks that disorder of the stomach affects\r\nsympathetically the heart and brain. He treats fully of inflammation\r\nof the stomach, for which he directs us to give relaxants and tonics,\r\nsuch as wormwood and mastich. He further recommends the application of\r\na plaster, composed of emollient and stimulant ingredients, such as\r\nwax, turpentine, ginger, opopanax, &c. It is singular that he and most\r\nof the ancient authorities have omitted to mention venesection for this\r\ncomplaint. We therefore entertain some doubts whether they meant by it\r\nthe gastritis of modern Nosologists, which, by the by, is of so rare\r\noccurrence, that some late writers of high name are of opinion that it\r\nnever occurs spontaneously. (See Christison on Poisons.) Some of the\r\nancient authors, however, do recommend venesection in this complaint,\r\nas for example, Serapion, Rhases, Avicenna, and Haly Abbas. Horatianus\r\nrecommends the same for sudden pains of the stomach. Cælius Aurelianus,\r\nwhile treating in general terms of stomach complaints, recommends\r\nbleeding, “si in vehementiam passio venerit.” He also prescribes cupping\r\nand leeching. His account of these affections is highly interesting,\r\nbut so circumstantial that we dare not venture even upon an abridgment\r\nof it. Haly Abbas speaks of the inflammation ending in suppuration. To\r\nAlsaharavius we particularly invite attention. Rhases gives a copious\r\nstatement of the opinions of all preceding authorities on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXVIII.—ON INFLATION OF THE STOMACH.\r\n\r\nThe formation of flatus in the stomach arises from the juices or food\r\nbeing dissolved into vapours by a gentle heat. For cold, as it is not\r\nof an attenuating and dissolving nature, does not engender flatulence;\r\nwhilst a violent heat not only attenuates, but likewise dissipates,\r\nand thus prevents the formation of flatulence. But a lesser degree of\r\nheat dissolves and changes the food, but not sufficiently, and hence\r\nflatus is gendered. Wherefore we must attenuate them by calefacient\r\nmedicines—boiling in oil the seed of cumin, of parsley, of cow-parsnip,\r\nand of carrot. When the affection partakes of cold, you may boil\r\nrue, bay-berries, gith, and fennel in the oil, and mix bitumen and\r\noil of bays. But if the pain be attended with inflammation, instead\r\nof calefacients, you may use relaxants, making a decoction of dill,\r\nand mixing with it the fat of a cock and of a goose. Those who have\r\nflatulence may be relieved by the decoction of a fasciculus of poley,\r\nor a decoction of calamint, having a small quantity of honey and a\r\ndrachm of pepper mixed with it. These remedies must be applied when the\r\npain is violent; but if it is moderate, fomentations from millet will\r\nbe sufficient. But a large cupping-instrument that will comprehend the\r\nnavel often removes the symptom at once. Castor also is of use to them,\r\nwhen taken in a draught with oxycrate, and when applied externally with\r\nSicyonian oil; and it also cures flatulence when attended with tormina.\r\nBut the ankles of a swine burnt, and taken in a draught, cure tormina\r\nand flatulence; and the round birthwort does the same. Pains from\r\nobstructions of the bowels, or flatulence arising from thickness of the\r\nhumours, or from cold, are relieved by drinking undiluted wine after\r\nfood; and, if sleep follow, it completely removes these complaints.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See all the authors referred to in the preceding Section.\r\n\r\nOur author’s treatment, which consists of dry cupping, dry fomentations,\r\nand the internal use of calefacients and wine, is what Celsus also\r\nrecommends. He likewise speaks favorably of exercising the upper parts\r\nof the body, of friction, and of using purgatives occasionally, and\r\nsometimes, though rarely, the bath. Serapion, Rhases, and Avicenna,\r\nrecommend similar treatment, namely, purgatives and aromatics, such as\r\naloes, anise, calamint, cumin, and the like. Haly Abbas forbids all\r\nflatulent food, such as pulse, milk, and grapes; recommends the bath\r\nafter much exercise, and before dinner, and the stomach to be rubbed,\r\nand a cataplasm of salt and cumin applied to it. He also prescribes\r\nmany calefacient and carminative articles, such as anise, rue, castor\r\nwith old wine, also the peppers, theriac, mithridate, hiera picra, &c.\r\nAlsaharavius recommends aromatics and carminatives, and afterwards that\r\nthe pit of the stomach should be rubbed with calefacient oils. Averrhoes\r\ndirects us to give all solid food, as flesh, puddings, &c. quite cold;\r\nbut spoon-meats may be eaten as warm as the blood or somewhat warmer.\r\nThis method, he adds, will clear the head and stomach of wind, beget\r\nfiner blood, brisker spirits, and cause a lively circulation of all the\r\nhumours.\r\n\r\nRhases and Avicenna describe _ulceration_ of the stomach very accurately,\r\nand also thickening of its coats.\r\n\r\nAvicenna mentions _rupture_ of the stomach, but does not say whether he\r\nalludes to spontaneous rupture or rupture from accident.\r\n\r\nActuarius has given a more distinct account of _hæmatemesis_ than any\r\nother of the ancient authorities. He says the blood may be brought\r\nup either pure or of a dark colour, and it may be occasioned either\r\nby external injuries or proceed from constitutional causes. The\r\nconstitutional causes are commonly either general plethora or atony of\r\nthe liver. In certain cases, he says, it proceeds from rupture of the\r\nvessels, and in others from relaxation of them, in others again from\r\ncorrosion. In _melæna_, he says, the skin is pale. (De Diagnos. i, 39.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXIX.—ON CHOLERA.\r\n\r\nCholera is an immoderate disorder of the belly, with discharges upwards\r\nand downwards, arising from continued indigestion of the food. Persons\r\nare affected with indigestion sometimes from the badness of their food,\r\nand sometimes owing to a redundance of depraved humours. Wherefore, if\r\nthe patient be seized with nausea and lancinating pains, while the food\r\nremains in the stomach undigested, we must order him to drink tepid\r\nwater, and to produce vomiting by putting his fingers or feathers down\r\nthe throat. We must also encourage the discharge by the bowels. After\r\nthe evacuation of the superfluities, he must take rest, and apply warmth\r\nto the hypochondrium, by means of sweet oil, with some wine; or by the\r\noil of mastich, or of spikenard, if it is winter: and he must be allowed\r\nto sleep. After digestion has been accomplished, let him have recourse\r\nto baths and wholesome food. When the discharge is immoderate, it will\r\nbe sufficient at first to try those things which are mentioned in the\r\nSecond Book for disorder of the belly. But when the discharge continues,\r\nand the belly loses its tone, and the pulse gets small and dense, we\r\nmust apply a cataplasm of dates, with flowers of wild vine, acacia, the\r\njuice of hypocistis, and pomegranate rind. For drink, give a cupful of\r\nmoderately cold water to swallow; or, what is still better, a decoction\r\nof roses, of the flowers of wild vine, of sumach, or of vine-shoots; or\r\nwe may give the juice of an acid-sweet pomegranate, sprinkling upon it\r\na little mint. When the excretions are more acrid, and heat and thirst\r\ncome on, we must give the seed of cucumber, with three cupfuls of water;\r\nand succory and lettuces boiled in oxycrate are to be used for food. When\r\nthe discharge cannot be stopped, we must administer some of the austere\r\nwines; if the patient be free of fever, the Palmatian, the Aminæan, or\r\npalm wine, or that from unripe grapes, with honey; but when he has fever,\r\npomegranate wine, or myrtle wine, or Cibyratic hydromel for drink, and\r\nalong with crumbs of bread, alica, or chondrus. If he loathes food from\r\ngrain, he may chew some summer fruit, or medlars, pears, quinces, or\r\npomegranates, but he must spit out the fleshy and hard parts. When he\r\ncannot retain the food, let a large dry-cupping instrument be fastened\r\nover the stomach, and while it is on let some of the afore-mentioned food\r\nbe taken. For the spasmodic contractions apply to the muscles hot rags\r\ndipped in oil, and liquid cerates, containing some castor and Sicyonian\r\noil; but before applying them let hot water be poured upon the legs. If\r\nhe cannot get sleep, we must have recourse to the remedies recommended\r\nfor watchfulness; and if his strength permit, he may take a potion from\r\npoppy-heads. When the disease is on the decline, he may be put into a\r\nbath, and recruited with chickens, pigeons, the feet of swine, or the\r\nlike. Diarrhœa, being a corruption of the food, for the most part\r\nceases spontaneously, if no more food be taken until after the complete\r\ndigestion and evacuation of the corrupted matters; but if it continue, we\r\nmust use the remedies applicable to cholera.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY.

In one, the patient drank hellebore in the juice of lentils,\r\nand vomited; he became cold, and was put into the hot hip-bath, where\r\nhe regained his heat and recovered. In another place, he says that the\r\ndisease is, for the most part, occasioned by unwholesome food, such as\r\npork improperly boiled, pot-herbs, summer fruits, &c.\r\n\r\nAretæus defines cholera to be a retrograde movement of the matters in the\r\nbody upon the stomach and intestines, consisting of a discharge upwards\r\nand downwards of bile, which, if the disease proves fatal, becomes black;\r\nand, at the same time, the extremities are cold, with profuse sweats,\r\npulse small and dense, constant straining to vomit, and tenesmus. He\r\nalso makes mention, among the symptoms, of spasms and contractions of\r\nthe muscles in the legs and arms, borborygmi, tormina, and syncope.\r\nThe complaint, he says, is occasioned by continued indigestion, and\r\nproves fatal by superinducing convulsions, suffocation, and retching.\r\nWith regard to the treatment, he cautions us not to stop the discharge\r\nat first, but to encourage it by giving frequently some tepid water;\r\nand when attended with tormina and coldness of the feet, to apply to\r\nthe belly hot oil of rue, and rub the legs to restore heat. When the\r\nfæces are all evacuated, he recommends some cold water to compose the\r\nstomach; and when the pulse sinks and becomes frequent, while at the\r\nsame time there are profuse sweats and deliquium, he approves of adding\r\na small quantity of wine to the water. It is to be of a fragrant and\r\nastringent kind, so as to strengthen the powers of the system. When all\r\nthe symptoms get worse, when spasms of the legs occur, and the pulse\r\nbecomes insensible, he advises us to give more wine and water. Should the\r\nvomiting continue, we must return to very hot drink and hot food, for,\r\nhe remarks, the transition often proves beneficial. When all these fail,\r\na cupping-instrument is to be put on between the shoulders or below the\r\nnavel. He afterwards speaks of such applications as those recommended by\r\nour author, namely, calefacients applied to the belly, chest, and legs.\r\nHe concludes with saying, that, if the symptoms, instead of improving,\r\nshould get worse after this treatment, it will be proper for the\r\nphysician to accelerate his retreat.\r\n\r\nWhen cholera is not attended with fever, Galen approves of giving a\r\npiece of bread soaked in diluted wine, of cold drink, and of applying\r\ncupping-instruments to the belly. When the patient is strong, he even\r\nrecommends the cold bath. He directs afterwards astringent food, and also\r\nspeaks of clysters, old wine, and asses’ milk. He mentions with seeming\r\napprobation that Asclepiades gave tepid water at the commencement.\r\n\r\nCelsus depends most upon tepid water, dry cupping, and sinapisms to the\r\nbelly. In extreme cases, he prescribes a light fragrant wine diluted with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAlexander’s account is very minute, but little different from that of\r\nAretæus. In certain cases, he permits poppies to remove insomnolency and\r\nwine to support the strength. Like Hippocrates, he describes correctly\r\ndry cholera. In this variety, which he attributes to a bilious humour, he\r\nrecommends purging with scammony or the picra of aloes. But in particular\r\nhe approves of friction and the application of strong ligatures to the\r\nextremities; to the arms and hands, when the evacuations are by the\r\nbelly; and to the feet and legs, when by vomiting from the stomach.\r\n\r\nAëtius, Oribasius, Actuarius, and Nonnus treat of the disease in nearly\r\nthe same terms as our author.\r\n\r\nFor cholera, Marcellus recommends various astringent remedies, both\r\nexternally and internally. Myrtle-wine, he says, will stop the vomiting.\r\nHe also commends opium.\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus calls cholera “omnibus acutis ægritudinibus\r\nvelocior.” Like the others, he recommends draughts of tepid water at the\r\ncommencement, and wine and aromatics in extreme cases.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus, with his accustomed accuracy, gives a complete history\r\nof the symptoms of this disease. The bile which is vomited, he says, is\r\nat first yellow, afterwards green, and at last black. His treatment is\r\nvery similar to that of Aretæus, namely, tepid water at the commencement\r\nto facilitate vomiting, sponges out of cold water applied over the\r\nstomach, or else cupping-instruments with much heat; aromatics, bread\r\nsoaked in wine, and the like. He condemns Hippocrates for sanctioning the\r\ngiving of hellebore. He blames Diocles for recommending southernwood,\r\nwhich, he remarks, is a very harsh medicine; and also for allowing milk,\r\nwhich, he says, is apt to grow acid. He finds fault with Heraclides\r\nTarentinus for trusting to opium and henbane.\r\n\r\nCassius Medicus accounts for the coldness of the extremities and\r\ncontractions thereof upon the supposition that they are occasioned by the\r\nvital spirits having left them and been determined to the stomach.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing very original in the works of the Arabians. Haly\r\nremarks that cholera consists of a discharge of bile. He inculcates as\r\na settled principle of treatment, that, when the strength continues\r\ngood, and the discharge not immoderate, the vomiting is to be encouraged\r\nby giving tepid water with oil of sweet almonds to drink. When there\r\nis great prostration of strength and tendency to deliquium, he directs\r\nus to sprinkle water on the patient’s face, to apply ligatures to his\r\nlimbs, and to rub his feet and legs with a calefacient oil. When the\r\ndischarge cannot be got otherwise stopped, he advises us to apply a\r\ncupping-instrument over the stomach. Alsaharavius, like the others,\r\ndirects us to promote the vomiting at first by giving tepid water. Among\r\nhis other remedies, he recommends an infusion of aloes and wormwood,\r\nRhases recommends draughts of tepid water, the application of snow over\r\nthe stomach, ligatures to the extremities, wine, and astringents. He,\r\nAvicenna, and most of the authorities direct us to encourage sleep.\r\nAvicenna’s plan of treatment is exactly the same as that of Rhases.\r\n\r\nWith respect to diarrhœa, Celsus recommends us to give an emetic; to\r\nanoint next day with oil; to give moderate food and undiluted wine; and\r\nto apply over the belly a cerate with rue. Cælius Aurelianus enjoins at\r\nfirst rest and abstinence, then astringent applications to the belly,\r\nnext day astringent food, and then wine and the hath. Haly Abbas remarks\r\nthat a diarrhœa is not to be rashly stopped unless it become excessive,\r\nin which case astringents are to be given, such as galls, roses,\r\npomegranate fruit, &c. Serapion and Rhases mention an emetic as a remedy\r\nfor diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nFor the cure of diarrhœa, the veterinary surgeons recommend at first\r\nbleeding and hot water, and then astringents, such as sumach and\r\npomegranate rind. (Geopon. xvi, 8.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XL.—ON LIENTERY AND CÆLIAC AFFECTION.\r\n\r\nThere are two varieties of lientery: the one arising from superficial\r\nulceration of the intestines, and (according to some) from a cicatrix\r\noccasioned most frequently by dysentery or other defluxions; and the\r\nother from an atony of the retentive faculty of the bowels: the second\r\nvariety being in our opinion connected with the cæliac affection; for\r\nin it the stomach being unable to concoct and distribute the food, it\r\nis discharged downwards in a smooth, undigested, and liquid state, the\r\nstomach in all cases labouring under a defluxion. But in lientery the\r\npassage of the food is quick, and the indigestion more intense; so that\r\nthe appearance of the food which has been taken is preserved, and by\r\nthese circumstances it is more especially distinguished from cæliac\r\naffection. Wherefore we must apply cataplasms of linseed with dates. And\r\nlentisk and bramble boiled with oxymel is a very effectual remedy; but,\r\nwhen there is flatulence of the bowels, we must mix some cumin, dill, and\r\nrue. If the defluxion increase, we may add quinces, moist alum, acacia,\r\nhypocistis, galls, some or all of these. Cerates also made of myrtle-oil\r\nwith some astringent wine are useful, and the caleficient epithemes\r\nfrom the bay-berries, or from seeds. But that from the flowers of wild\r\nvine, that from grape-stones, and that ascribed to Antyllus are more\r\nastringent. But the one called Erythrian is wonderfully efficacious.\r\nWhen the disease is protracted, we must have recourse to a dropax\r\n(calefacient plaster) along the abdomen, and the cerate from mustard, or\r\nmustard itself. The drinks which are taken should be simple, containing\r\nplantain-seed, or the seed of dock, or the rind of pomegranate, or dried\r\nservices, or dried unripe grapes from the Aminæan vine, to the amount of\r\nthree oboli; which things, when there is no fever, are to be taken in six\r\ncupfuls of an austere wine, but when there is fever in rain water. It\r\nwill injure the stomach less if the dried crop of hens be sprinkled upon\r\nthe drink. But diuretics, such as parsley, maiden-hair, and the like,\r\noccasion a metastasis of the fluid; and, in like manner, the compound\r\nones, as that of Polyides (it is the sigillum), the trochisk from amber,\r\nthat from Egyptian thorn, the one called clidium, and that from seeds.\r\nThe following one is most excellent: Of the seed of the wild dock, oz.\r\niss; of plantain-seed, oz. j; of the juice of the hypocistis, dr. vj; of\r\ngum or acacia, dr. iij; add to a decoction of the juice of quinces boiled\r\nto a third part.—_Another_: Of cumin, of pepper, of Syriac sumach, of the\r\nflowers of the wild pomegranate, of each, oz. iss; of pomegranate-rind,\r\noz. j; of laserwort, oz. ss; either sprinkle a drachm of it dried upon\r\nthe drink, or mix with oxymel, and give morning and evening.—_Another_:\r\nOf black myrtle, a spoonful and a half; of anise, of dried roses, of the\r\nflower of wild vine, of each, half a spoonful; of dates, xx in number;\r\nmake trochisks, and give a drachm with water or diluted wine. And the\r\ntheriac from vipers is also an excellent remedy for them. When the\r\ndischarge is acrid and bilious, the food should be from chondrus, rice,\r\nalica, and the like; but some of the astringents should be boiled along\r\nwith them, such as pears, apples, quinces, medlars, and such like. Boiled\r\nmilk is also proper. The drink should be either a light watery wine, or\r\nsome of the sweet potions. If the discharges consist more of phlegm, we\r\nmay change the diet to the opposite kind, mixing the seeds of some of the\r\nstomachic vegetables, anise, cumin, or the seed of parsley. The dried\r\nlentil twice boiled is often of use to them, when eaten with a little\r\nvinegar or oxymel, and cabbages likewise twice boiled; but it is better\r\nto make the second boiling in oxycrate. They should drink some of the\r\nolder and more heating wines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY.

Galen remarks that the affection may be\r\ndefined to be a loss of digestion, the food having undergone no change in\r\nconsistence, smell, or quality, while in the bowels. The intestines, he\r\nsays, are either in a state of ulceration and great tenderness, or they\r\nhave lost their retentive faculty.\r\n\r\nAretæus calls it a disease arising from broad ulcers of the intestines\r\nwhen the food passes through the bowels not at all altered. With respect\r\nto the treatment, he merely says that an emetic after food will remove it.\r\n\r\nCelsus recommends astringent food, stimulant and rubefacient applications\r\nexternally; and afterwards exercise, friction, insolation, and vomiting,\r\nwhich, he says, Hippocrates directed to be produced with white hellebore\r\nwhen other things fail.\r\n\r\nDioscorides states that when the inner membrane of a cock’s stomach has\r\nbeen dried and reduced to powder, it may be given triturated in wine with\r\ngreat advantage in stomach complaints. Our author, it will be remarked,\r\nmakes mention of this medicinal article.\r\n\r\nArchigenes and Aëtius describe cæliac affection as an atony of the\r\nintestines, so that the food is not retained until it is digested. They\r\ntreat of it at great length, their principal remedial measures being\r\npurging, vomiting, and astringent applications. According to Psellus it\r\narises from superficial ulceration of the intestines. Psellus defines\r\nlientery to be a loss of the retentive faculty of the bowels, so that the\r\nfood passes undigested in a liquid state.\r\n\r\nSerapion for lientery directs us to give astringent decoctions, and to\r\napply to the belly an astringent epitheme containing galls, roses,\r\npomegranate-flowers, &c. the food to consist principally of millet and\r\nthe like. He also recommends a mixture of goat’s milk and water boiled\r\nuntil the water evaporate. When the stomach is loaded he prescribes an\r\nemetic. In cæliac affection he directs us to strengthen the intestines by\r\nastringents internally and externally. Haly Abbas defines lientery to be\r\na quick discharge of the food in an unchanged state. It arises, he adds,\r\nfrom immoderate debility of the retentive faculty of the intestines, or\r\nfrom excess of the expulsive. It is said to be generally caused by ulcers\r\nwhich, being irritated by the food, stimulate the intestines to expel it.\r\nHe recommends a variety of remedies, most of which are either astringents\r\nor acids, such as balaustine, rind of acorns, mastich, sumach, galls,\r\nroses, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLI.—ON TENESMUS.\r\n\r\nTenesmus is sometimes the precursor of dysentery, but often it prevails\r\nalone for a short time, and then ceases. The affection is an irresistible\r\ndesire of evacuation, discharging nothing but some bloody or mucous\r\nmatter, which is the cause of the whole complaint, being an œdematous\r\ninflammation in the rectum, which creates the impression of fæces lodged\r\nin the intestine, and a desire of evacuation. And Galen relates that a\r\nstone has sometimes been discharged by the anus in attacks of tenesmus.\r\nBut tenesmus often arises in consequence of fæces being retained in the\r\nsmall intestines, and is increased by astringents and obstruents, but\r\nimmediately removed by acrid injections, such as honied-water with salts,\r\nor by any of the emollients taken by the mouth, such as damascenes, dried\r\nfigs, the herb mercury, or the whey of milk; for when the fæces are\r\nevacuated, the complaint immediately ceases. When the tenesmus occurs\r\nwithout such a cause, it will be proper to allay the inflammation by\r\nbarley-flour heated, the embrocations from wine, myrtle-oil, rose-oil,\r\nor the oil of unripe olives, applied to the loins and lower belly. The\r\nmucous matters shut up in the rectum must be cleared away by an injection\r\nof honied water. And salt and water when injected often effects the\r\npurpose, or six drachms of salts in a hemina of hot water. But we must\r\nmitigate the pain and intense sufferings by sitting in a hip-bath\r\nof fenugreek, mallows, or linseed. Sometimes the following hip-bath\r\nwill effect the purpose: Of bramble, of myrtle, of the flowers of the\r\npomegranate, of bays, and of green cypress shoots, mixing these in equal\r\nparts, boil in water. It is the Marcellian. When the inflammation and\r\nirritation are deep-seated, we must use injections of some of the juices\r\nof grain boiled with some of the astringents. And sweet oil injected and\r\nretained for several hours has the effect of removing the violent pain.\r\nWhen the desires to go to stool are frequent, we must apply a ball of\r\nwarm threads to the anus, or warm bran in a bag, or a sponge, or some\r\nsuch thing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See the authors referred to in the preceding Section.\r\n\r\nCelsus recommends the tepid bath, emollient and astringent applications\r\nto the rectum, such as butter and roses, or alum wrapped in wool and\r\napplied, the remedies for tormina, and an austere wine every alternate\r\nday.\r\n\r\nAëtius may be referred to as an author who has treated of this affection\r\nin a very accurate manner, although nearly to the same effect as our\r\nauthor. Among other things he mentions the application to the anus of a\r\nsponge soaked in a solution of galls in vinegar.\r\n\r\nNonnus defines tenesmus to be an inflammation of the rectum, and says\r\nthat it is to be benefited by injections of the oil of rue, or of wine\r\nand honey with brine; by hip-baths of astringent decoctions, such as\r\nmyrtles, bays, &c. or by fomentations with a sponge.\r\n\r\nAvicenna describes two varieties of tenesmus, the false, which is\r\noccasioned by the lodgment of hardened fæces in the intestines, and is to\r\nbe cured by emollient clysters, &c.; and the true, which, if occasioned\r\nby cold, is to be relieved by fomenting the parts with a sponge or the\r\nlike soaked in hot water; if by hard pressure, a sponge is to be squeezed\r\nout of hot oil and applied; if by an aposteme, it is to be treated upon\r\ngeneral principles by bleeding and embrocations; if by a flux, remedies\r\nsuited to that complaint are to be given; and, if by ulcers, the common\r\napplications to them are to be used. Haly Abbas treats fully of tenesmus,\r\nlike Avicenna. In several of his prescriptions poppies and opium occur.\r\nWhen produced by retention of scybalæ, he recommends powerful evacuants,\r\nsuch as colocynth, prunes, turbit, scammony, &c. One of Serapion’s\r\nprescriptions contains burnt lead, sumach, myrrh, &c. By a stone, said\r\nby our author and Galen to be sometimes discharged in cases of tenesmus,\r\nmust have been meant an alvine concretion of a hard nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLII.—ON DYSENTERY.\r\n\r\nDysentery is an ulceration of the intestines, sometimes arising from the\r\ntranslation of tenesmus, or some of the disorders of the bowels formerly\r\nmentioned, and sometimes being itself the primary affection; and it is\r\nattended with evacuations, at first bilious, and of various colours,\r\nthen, accordingly, bloody, and at last ichorous, like that which runs\r\nfrom dead bodies. Dysentery, arising from black bile, is necessarily\r\nfatal, as indicating an ulcerated cancer. If, therefore, the appearances\r\nof ulceration be discharged, mixed with the fæces, and attended with\r\npains and tormina, you may be sure that the ulceration is seated in\r\nthe small intestines, and is to be remedied by medicines swallowed by\r\nthe mouth; but if the fæces be passed unmixed with the blood, it is an\r\naffection of the large intestines, and will yield rather to clysters.\r\nWhen there is a great discharge of blood by itself, the disease is called\r\nthe bloody dysentery. Sometimes the blood which is discharged is blacker\r\nthan natural and shining, owing to the liver’s not digesting properly\r\nthe food which is sent to it; and owing to an atony of the retentive or\r\nof the alterative faculty of the stomach, it is discharged from it like\r\nthe washings of newly-killed flesh. This is called hepatic dysentery, and\r\nwill be treated of along with the affections of the liver.\r\n\r\nIn general, therefore, we must use those things which were recommended\r\nfor cæliac and other preternatural evacuations; but, in particular, the\r\nLemnian earth cures a spreading dysentery when drunk or injected, the\r\nintestine being previously washed out with honied water, and afterwards\r\nwith salt water; and the juice of purslain is proper for dysenteric\r\naffections when drunk, or the purslain itself when boiled in oxycrate and\r\neaten. Plantain also is proper, and the fruit and leaves of the bramble,\r\nthe decoction of the root of marshmallows, the herb horsetail drunk in\r\nwater or wine, and the juice of it, the unripe fruit of the mulberry\r\ndried, and, still more, bramble-berries when similarly dried. Eggs\r\nboiled with vinegar and eaten, dry up fluxes of the belly; but it will\r\nanswer better if, mixing with them some of the articles which are good\r\nfor dysentery, you fry them, and give to eat. The wine of unripe grapes\r\nis most useful in these cases, and the red sumach, and the juice of it,\r\nthe rind of pomegranate, galls, grape-stones, medlars, myrtles, cornels,\r\nthe ashes of snails roasted whole. The following is a compound medicine:\r\nOf the ashes of snails, p. iv; of galls, p. ij; of pepper, p. j; reduce\r\nto a fine powder, and sprinkle upon the condiments, or give to drink in\r\nwater, or a white watery wine. It greatly helps dysenteric patients, when\r\nthe ulcers are not putrid. But the dried dung of dogs who have eaten\r\nbones, when drank in milk which has been curdled by having heated pebbles\r\nput into it, is of great service. The following are compound remedies:\r\nThe trochisk from Egyptian thorn, that of Philip, that from hartshorn,\r\nthat from seeds, and the Trigonus. The pills from macer are excellent\r\nremedies. The following is an admirable one: Of opium, of saffron, of\r\nIndian Lycium (_catechu?_), of acacia, of sumach, of frankincense, of\r\ngalls, of hypocistis, of pomegranate-rind, of myrrh, of aloes, equal\r\nparts; give in water to the amount of three oboli.—_Another_: Of sumach,\r\ndr. viij; of galls, of pomegranate rind, of each, dr. iv; give in a\r\nspoonful of wine.—_Another_: Of sumach, dr. viij; of galls, of acacia,\r\nof gum, of each, dr. ij; of opium, dr. j; give one drachm in diluted\r\nwine. This linctus will suit with them: Of black myrtles, one sextarius;\r\nof Syriac sumach, one sextarius; of Theban dates, lb. ij; of the flesh\r\nof quinces, lb. j; ten sour pomegranates with their rind; of astringent\r\nwine, one sextarius: boil to a third, and, having strained, add of honey,\r\nlb. vj; and, having boiled to a proper consistence, give for a linctus.\r\nIt is clear, that the cataplasms should be made from astringents the\r\nmaterials of which you are acquainted with. On account of the tenesmus,\r\nwhich proves a troublesome symptom in dysentery, injections made from\r\nthe juice of rice, chondrus, or the like, with the tallow of goats,\r\nand likewise those recommended in the section on Tenesmus will prove\r\nserviceable. But, if there is a discharge of blood, we must inject the\r\njuice of knotgrass, or of plantain, with acacia, hypocistis, or the like.\r\nBut, if this symptom be urgent, we may inject some styptic, such as\r\nthe ashes of unwashed wool, or of new sponge, which has been soaked in\r\nliquid pitch, or the blood of an ox, or liquid alum; or it may be soaked\r\nin the juice of asses’ dung in like manner, and burnt. And the trochisk\r\nof Andron is an excellent remedy, and that of Musa, and the like. But\r\nsuppositories of collyria are among the most effectual remedies, more\r\nparticularly when the discharges are attended with pain. When there is a\r\nspreading ulcer in the intestines, which you may ascertain from the fetid\r\nsmell and putridity of the discharges, and from its not having occurred\r\nat the commencement, but after some interval, we must use escharotic\r\ninjections, such as the trochisks called Faustiani, that from paper, the\r\nBithynian, the Thronian, and that from cork, injected in the decoction\r\nof dried lentils, or of some of the other astringents. And the following\r\nenema is of approved efficacy: Of burnt omphacis (it is the cavity from\r\nwhich grows the acorn which the tanners use), of arsenic, of comfrey, of\r\nSyriac sumach, equal parts. Mix about two spoonfuls of these when pounded\r\ntogether with the juice of rice, and the juice of alkanet that has the\r\nthorny, broad, and black leaf (which they call _chærospelethron_), and\r\nwith the white of eggs, to the amount of two or three ounces; and give\r\nfor an injection. Those epithemes apply which were mentioned for cæliac\r\naffection. And, in like manner, those liniments to the belly which are\r\ncomposed of astringent and desiccative materials, with some of the\r\nglutinous substances, gum, frankincense, taurocolla, fine flour, may\r\nhave place with the corresponding cataplasms. The food at first should\r\nbe eggs mixed with milk, and the spoon-meats made from frumentaceous\r\nsubstances, either alone or boiled with milk. And milk itself moderately\r\nboiled is an excellent thing. The use of pot-herbs is not necessary;\r\nhowever, we may allow the patients to taste of boiled endive, of succory,\r\nof plantain, of cabbage twice boiled, and of the autumnal fruits, such\r\nas are astringent, spitting out the fleshy parts, and whatever else will\r\nirritate the intestines. When the intemperament is very hot, we must\r\ngive raw succory, and make the patients drink of cold water. The other\r\ndrink should be rain-water; and, when the stomach is languid, wine may be\r\ntaken. Afterwards they may take the drier and more digestible parts of\r\nfowls, and use baths of sweet water. But if the flux is brought on by the\r\nuse of them, soak a large sponge or pieces of bread made from fine flour\r\nin wine of Ascalon, or some of the hot astringents, apply to the whole\r\nabdomen, bind it on, and order them to bathe in this state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY.

The disease, he says, is occasioned by an overflow\r\nof phlegm and bile to the veins of the belly, producing erosion and\r\nulceration of the intestines. His treatment consists of purging the\r\nhead, emetics, opening the belly, emollient clysters, and a regulated\r\ndiet. In one of his aphorisms he states that a spontaneous vomiting\r\ncures dysentery. Another of his aphorisms is that a dysentery commencing\r\nfrom black bile is mortal. Another is, that when substances resembling\r\nflesh are discharged by a person affected with dysentery it is a mortal\r\nsymptom. (iv.) His commentator Theophilus says, in explanation, that it\r\nis because the intestines are ulcerated and do not readily heal. (Ed.\r\nDietz, 401.)\r\n\r\nGalen treats separately of hepatic dysentery and of dysentery connected\r\nwith ulceration of the mucous membrane of the intestines. Of his remedies\r\nsome are astringents, such as galls, alum, dried roses, and hypocistis;\r\nsome anodyne, such as opium and henbane; some are detergents, such as\r\nmyrrh, pepper, spikenard, &c.; and some escharotics, such as arsenic,\r\nsandarach, the scales of copper, and the like. These last are to be\r\ngiven only in clysters. Modern physicians will be disposed to condemn\r\nthem without a trial; and yet, as arsenic may be given by the mouth in\r\nproperly-regulated doses, there appears no good reason why it may not be\r\nsafely administered in injections. Rogerius, one of the earlier modern\r\nwriters, speaks favorably of trochisks of arsenic. (i, 37.) Sprengel,\r\nhowever, decidedly condemns the practice. He says of Athenæus: “Il\r\nrecommandait dans la dyssenterie un lavement dont un _mélange affreux_\r\nd’orpiment et de realgar formait la base.” (Hist. de la Méd.) See Sect.\r\nxxix of this Book.\r\n\r\nAretæus gives a very circumstantial description of the symptoms of\r\ndysentery, but unfortunately his chapter on the treatment is entirely\r\nwanting. He describes all the varieties of ulcers, the superficial, the\r\ndeep-seated, the irritable, the callous, and the like; and the discharges\r\nfrom them, whether thin, bilious, fetid, devoid of smell, high-seated, or\r\notherwise. Of the other authorities, Alexander may be mentioned as the\r\none who has most correctly pointed out the importance of attending to\r\nthe part of the intestines in which the ulceration is seated. The large\r\nintestines, he says, are most commonly affected. He approves of bleeding\r\nin certain cases. His treatment is judiciously regulated according to\r\nthe exciting causes; and, in many cases, he prescribes gentle laxatives.\r\nOne of the varieties of dysentery described by him is said to proceed\r\nfrom disorder of the liver, which is impaired in its attractive faculty.\r\nThis variety he calls hepatic dysentery, which, instead of attempting\r\nto cure, as he says many do empirically, by a combination of aloes with\r\nastringents, he recommends to be treated according to the nature of the\r\naffection and the humour which produces it. His views of the treatment\r\nare given at great length.\r\n\r\nCelsus gives a very distinct account of the treatment. He enjoins rest,\r\nas all motion proves injurious to the ulcers; recommends astringent\r\ncataplasms, frequent washing with warm water in which vervain has been\r\nboiled, astringent food, injections of ptisan, milk, oil, the decoction\r\nof linseed, the yelks of eggs with rose-water, &c. For drink he directs\r\ntepid water to be given, either alone or with an austere wine; or, if\r\nthese things fail, a draught of cold water to stop the discharges from\r\nthe bowels. When the disease is seated high up, the belly is to be opened.\r\n\r\nAëtius allows the abstraction of a small quantity of blood from the arm\r\nwhen inflammation is present. He says it allays heat, produces revulsion,\r\nand induces sleep. His internal remedies are much the same as those of\r\nGalen.\r\n\r\nMuch of our author’s treatment is borrowed from Oribasius.\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus, like the others, recommends, when the ulcers are\r\nattended with putridity, a powder containing arsenic, quicklime, and\r\nburnt paper, administered in an astringent wine, or in a decoction of\r\nastringent herbs. Marcellus makes mention of a similar application, which\r\nhe directs to be used only when symptoms of malignity appear.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus gives a very comprehensive description of dysentery,\r\nthe principal symptoms of which are fever, anxiety, rumbling of the\r\nbelly, sometimes retention of urine; tongue rough, furred, and black;\r\ntenesmus and pungent pains of the intestines and anus. The disease, he\r\nsays, consists of a defluxion from the belly with ulceration, and is\r\npreceded by diarrhœa, cholera, or inflammation. He animadverts upon the\r\ntreatment of others with his usual freedom. Thus he blames Erasistratus\r\nfor using nothing but astringents, whereas many cases of dysentery\r\nrequire laxatives. His treatment is minutely detailed, but is not very\r\ndifferent from our author’s.\r\n\r\nLeo, for bloody dysentery, like our author, recommends pills of macer,\r\nthe troche of corals, and the decoction of rhubarb.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sprengel, Nonnus is the first author who distinguishes\r\nthe white dysentery from the red. It is obvious, however, that the\r\ndistinction between the two varieties had been made by earlier\r\nauthorities. We may add that Actuarius treats of the bloody dysentery\r\nvery fully.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians follow closely the treatment of the Greeks. Injections\r\ncontaining arsenic are recommended by Serapion, Avicenna, and Haly Abbas.\r\nRhases, like Aëtius, admits of venesection in certain cases. He refers\r\nthe disease, in general, to debility of the retentive faculty of the\r\nliver and derangement of the bile. Haly treats separately and minutely\r\nfirst of intestinal dysentery and next of hepatic. The intestinal, he\r\nsays, is occasioned by ulceration of the intestines. He also describes\r\nthe bloody dysentery, like our author. His treatment is directed upon\r\ngeneral principles. He recommends various clysters; and, when the ulcers\r\nare in the rectum, he directs us, among other remedies, to introduce a\r\ntent, soaked in a solution of arsenic, quicklime, hypocistis, &c. Some of\r\nhis stimulant applications, however, are merely detergents, and do not\r\ncontain septics. The ingredients of his ordinary injections are either\r\nemollients or astringents, according to circumstances. The account given\r\nby Alsaharavius is valuable, but too long for our limits. Rhases, in\r\ncases of protracted dysentery, directs snow to be applied to the belly.\r\nIn fact most of the ancient authorities recommend cold applications in\r\ncases of chronic dysentery.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLIII.—ON COLIC AFFECTION.\r\n\r\nThe colon, being a part of the large intestine, takes its origin in\r\nthe right iliac region, and passes across to the left, in the form of\r\na belt. The most violent pains arise in it from various causes, either\r\nfrom a thick and pituitous humour shut up between its coats, or from a\r\nthick flatus that cannot find a passage out, or from inflammation of\r\nthe intestine, or from acrid and sharp humours. Those, therefore, who\r\nsuffer from a thick and pituitous humour, have a deep-seated pain along\r\nthe whole abdomen, and especially in the region of the colon; there\r\nis a sensation as if it were pierced by a wimble; they are troubled\r\nwith tormina, eructations, nausea, and vomitings of all kinds, but\r\nmore especially of phlegm. The belly is greatly constipated, so as not\r\nto allow the passage even of wind; and any fæces which are discharged\r\nseem like the dung of oxen, light and windy. These symptoms are usually\r\npreceded by the continued use of food of a cold and incrassating nature,\r\nrepletion, indigestion, inactivity, and the like. When the attack\r\nproceeds from flatulence, there is rather a sense of distension. When\r\nit is from inflammation, there is a sense of heat in the part, and no\r\ninconsiderable fever, retention of the urine as well as of the fæces,\r\npulsation in the belly, thirst, and troublesome heat, nausea, and\r\nvomitings, more especially of bile, which afford no relief. In short,\r\nthis is the most severe of the colic affections, and threatens to pass\r\ninto ileus. When acrid and sharp humours are the cause of the pain,\r\nthe patients, as in the case of inflammation, have heat, thirst, and\r\nsleeplessness; if they have fever, it is less than in the former case;\r\ntheir urine is acrid; the alvine discharges bilious; and often along with\r\nthe discharge from the bowels the pain is aggravated, and exacerbations\r\nthereof take place, more especially after heating food or drink. Pains\r\noccasioned by cold, viscid, and thick humours are to be cured by such\r\nthings as are not violently heating; for by things which are thus heating\r\nthe humours are dissolved and converted into air. Wherefore we must\r\ntry to incide and concoct them by carminatives, and such medicines as\r\nare attenuant and desiccant, without heating much at the beginning of\r\nthe complaint. The fæces being evacuated from the bowels by suitable\r\nclysters, we must use an injection of oil, in which cumin or rue has been\r\nboiled, with the grease of a goose or hen; or of a decoction from the\r\nroots of wild cucumber, with a drachm of myrrh and some honey and oil;\r\nor from myrrh, honey, and Sicyonian oil. And often, when common oil is\r\ninjected, the vitreous phlegm is discharged along with it, and instantly\r\nremoves the pain. If, owing to the violence of the pain, the injection\r\nbe retained, we must apply a suppository of honey, cumin, nitre, and\r\nthe dried seeds of rue; or of a stalk of cabbage well shaven down and\r\nmacerated in salt water; or of the ashes of cabbage mixed with honey; or\r\nof colocynth triturated with honey, nitre, and cumin. The suppositories\r\nshould be six fingers’ breadth in length, so that they may extend beyond\r\nthe sphincter muscle. The anus is to be anointed with the juice of\r\nsow-bread, with honey and nitre, or with centaury along with honey and\r\nnitre. When the pain is continued, in addition to the afore-mentioned,\r\nthese injections are to be used: Of turpentine-rosin, oz. j; or of\r\nopopanax, dr. i; or of galbanum, dr. iv; of bitumen, an equal part,\r\nwith, of nitre, dr. j; and of water, oz. j; of oil of rue, oz. v, or\r\nmore. Embrocations are to be applied to the affected parts from the\r\noil of cumin, of dill, or Sicyonian oil. Cataplasms are to be applied,\r\ncomposed of the medicine called trispermum with cumin, bay-berries, and\r\nparsley-seed. Epithemes are to be applied, namely, that from seeds,\r\nthat from bay-berries, that from meliot, and the polyarchian. Let the\r\npatients sit in a hip-bath of the decoction of fenugreek, marshmallows,\r\nchamomile, mugwort, dill, bay, and the like. And they may be made to\r\nsit in a hip-bath of warm oil, or in oil and water. They should take\r\npotions containing wormwood and cumin, in equal parts, or panacea with\r\nwater, or of castor, of anise, and of the peppers, dr. j, with oxymel.\r\nWhen the pain does not remit, we must give them a draught, containing\r\nthe medicine from three peppers, or the theriac; and have recourse to a\r\nsinapism and dropax during the remissions, and to the natural baths; but\r\nthey must abstain from bathing in drinkable water, unless compelled to\r\nhave recourse to them by the urgency of the pain; when, having previously\r\ninjected some of the afore-mentioned medicines, we must direct them to\r\nbathe, and be fomented within the heated walls of the bath, having been\r\npreviously rubbed with some of the detergent ointments containing nitre.\r\nWhen the pain is violent, we must use those things which are moderately\r\nsoothing, such as the trochisk of castor, either injected or taken by the\r\nmouth, and such like remedies. But powerful narcotics must be avoided,\r\nwhich allay the pain indeed for a short time, but render the affection\r\nmore protracted by incrassating the offending matter, and occasioning\r\nobstruction of the pores of the intestine. When the phlegm is attenuated,\r\nwe must purge them with hiera picra, or such pills as these: Of aloes,\r\nof euphorbium, of pure granum cnidium, of scammony, equal parts. The\r\ndose is two scruples. A heating and desiccant diet will suit with them.\r\nAt first, indeed, they should abstain from food, but afterwards take\r\nacrid food. Wherefore we must give them leeks boiled with prepared wine\r\nand parsley, and marsh asparagus, raw garlic, more especially if they\r\ndo not dislike these things; and they may drink of the prepared wine,\r\nand take some bread with it. Afterwards we must give them wholesome and\r\ndigestible food, avoiding a surfeit and indigestion. If it is a flatulent\r\nspirit which causes the pain, after carminative injections and draughts,\r\ndry-cupping by means of large cupping-instruments, heated and fixed along\r\nthe whole abdomen, often effects a cure. When the intestine is in a state\r\nof inflammation, we must bleed from the arm; but if dysuria prevails,\r\nwe must likewise open the vein in the ankle, and use the remedies\r\nalready mentioned, except those things which are acrid and powerfully\r\ncathartic; and we must rather use soothing injections, cataplasms,\r\nfomentations, placing the patient in a hip-bath of oil. We may also\r\napply cupping-instruments to them, and lay a cerate upon the abdomen,\r\ncontaining, of wax, oz. v; of chamomile, oz. ij; of rose-oil, oz. ij; of\r\nthe flour of beans, oz. ss; five yelks of eggs pounded with the juice of\r\nlinseed. The diet should be light, and such as that applicable in fever,\r\nuntil the inflammation be resolved. But if the pain arise from acrid and\r\nsharp humours, we must administer injections of oil, in which has been\r\nboiled fenugreek or marshmallows, with plain fresh grease of a goose\r\nor hen, or the juice of ptisan with rose-oil, or the juice of linseed.\r\nThey must take the antidote called picra from aloes in a draught, and\r\nuse baths of sweet waters, and spoon-meats from chondrus or ptisan, and\r\nfishes caught among rocks; and, in a word, the whole regimen should be\r\nmoistening and cooling. The patient must abstain from all acrid food\r\nand medicines, and from hot fomentations, by means of embrocations and\r\ncataplasms, and from drinking wine, more especially old. When the pain is\r\nstrong, we may also use narcotics; for they prove less injurious in this\r\ncase than in any of the others, incrassating and moderately cooling the\r\nthin and sharp humours. I am of opinion that the colic affection which\r\nnow prevails is occasioned by such humours; the disease having taken\r\nits rise in the country of Italy, but raging also in many other regions\r\nof the Roman empire, like a pestilential contagion, which in many cases\r\nterminates in epilepsy, but in others in paralysis of the extremities,\r\nwhile the sensibility of them is preserved, and sometimes both these\r\naffections attacking together. And of those who fell into epilepsy the\r\ngreater number died; but of the paralytics the most recovered, as their\r\ncomplaint proved a critical metastasis of the cause of the disorder.\r\nThose, therefore, who were thus affected, a certain physician in Italy\r\ncured, in an incredible way, by putting them boldly upon a refrigerant\r\ndiet. For he gave them unboiled lettuces previously cooled, and succory,\r\nin like manner, to eat until they were more than sated; and also grapes,\r\napples, fish which have hard flesh, and, in short, all the crustacea;\r\nalso the feet of oxen, the bulbi, and the like, namely, things which\r\nwere not only cold by their powers, but likewise to the touch. He seldom\r\ngave wine, and when he did, he mixed it with cold water. And he gave\r\ncold water for drink, or cold oxycrate, and prohibited all warm food\r\nand that of the middle kind; and, contrary to all expectation, he cured\r\nmost people in this way, and even some who had begun to experience a\r\nconversion of the disease into epilepsy or paralysis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Hippocrates (de Affect. xv); Galen (de Med. sec. loc.\r\nix; de Loc. Affect. vi, 2); Aretæus (Morb. Acut. ii, 6; Chron. ii, 8);\r\nAlexander (ix, 1); Celsus (iv, 14); Oribasius (Loc. Affect.

When the pains are seated in the lower part\r\nof the belly, he merely gives clysters and laxatives.\r\n\r\nGalen gives a long list of preparations for colic. They consist\r\nprincipally of narcotics, such as opium, henbane, and mandragora, along\r\nwith carminatives and aromatics, as anise, pepper, valerian, cinnamon,\r\nsaffron, gentian, and the like.\r\n\r\nAretæus concludes his chapter on ileus with a short account of colic.\r\nHe remarks that the colon being a larger and more fleshy intestine than\r\nthe ileum, the pain is less acute, and the complaint in so far less\r\ndangerous. The pain, he says, sometimes extends to the side, resembling\r\npleurisy; sometimes to the false ribs, resembling hepatitis or splenitis;\r\nand sometimes to the os sacrum, tops of the thighs, and testicles. The\r\ncomplaint is attended with unavailing vomiting; and what is vomited is\r\nthin, bilious, and oily. He also describes a more protracted species\r\nof colic among the chronic diseases. Among the symptoms he enumerates\r\ntorpor, loathing of food, watchfulness, and swelling of the face. He\r\nsays the pain sometimes shoots down to the testicles, whereby ignorant\r\nsurgeons have been led into the mistake of supposing that the disease\r\nwas seated there, and have made an incision into the cremasters. Does he\r\nallude to the operation for strangulated hernia? or does he mean to say\r\nthat the disease is confounded with inflammation of the testicle? His\r\ntreatment of ileus will be given in the next Section.\r\n\r\nAlexander insists strongly on the absolute necessity of distinguishing\r\ncolic from the diseases of the adjoining parts, which, he remarks, is\r\nsometimes difficult. He first treats of colic pain arising from a cold\r\nhumour, and discusses fully the remedies for it. They are nearly such as\r\nour author recommends, namely, attenuant food, including white wines in\r\ncases of flatulence; avoiding the common bath, which does no good, but\r\nusing the sulphureous bath if convenient; rubbing the affected parts\r\nwith calefacient ointments, or applying heated bricks to them; purging\r\nwith aloes, scammony, and the like; using the hip-bath made with the\r\ndecoctions of parsley and anise, common oil, and the like; applying\r\nepithemes; administering clysters of hot oil, either alone or with\r\nsome carminative, such as turpentine; giving narcotics, as opium and\r\nhenbane, when the humours are thin and acrid, but not otherwise; applying\r\nsinapisms and calefacient plasters; sometimes giving emetics; and in\r\nprotracted cases enjoining exercise. When the disease proceeds from\r\nflatulence, he applies dry fomentations of millet, calefacient oils, and\r\na cupping-instrument to the belly. When it is occasioned by constipation,\r\nhe directs us to remove the obstruction by giving water, oil, and mead,\r\nand administering the same in clysters. In obstinate cases he directs us\r\nto inflate the bowels with a bellows, and afterwards to inject a little\r\nnitre and oil and water. He also speaks of pills or pellets of lead. When\r\nit proceeds from hot and bilious humours, he gives for food fish, the\r\ntestacea, the most indigestible parts of quadrupeds; and recommends the\r\ncommon bath, and purging with drastic cathartics, such as hellebore and\r\nscammony. When inflammation is the cause, he forbids purgatives, because\r\nthey only increase the evil, but recommends general bleeding repeated at\r\nintervals; and, if the urine is suppressed, bleeding at the ankles; also\r\nemollient clysters, external applications of a soothing nature, and baths\r\nafter venesection, but not before.\r\n\r\nCelsus recommends principally dry fomentations, friction of the\r\nextremities, and dry cupping. He also mentions a medicine called the\r\ncolic composition, consisting of poppy tears, pepper, anise, castor,\r\nspikenard, myrrh, &c.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of Cælius Aurelianus’s chapter on colic is unfortunately\r\nlost. He approves of venesection, fomentations of sweet oil, and\r\ninjections of the same; but disapproves of adding rue, anise, or anything\r\ncalefacient to them; speaks favorably of cupping and leeching, which are\r\nto be followed by hot fomentations with sponges squeezed out of warm\r\nwater, or by the hip-bath. As to the calefacient and acrid things usually\r\ngiven, namely, parsley, cumin, and the like, he properly directs them\r\nto be avoided when inflammation is present. In this case he recommends\r\nthe bath of oil. When the complaint is on the decline, he approves of\r\ngestation, of friction of the belly with rubefacients; and of sinapisms,\r\ncalefacient plasters, and the like. He speaks favorably of a long\r\nsea-voyage, and of the use of medicinal springs, especially sulphureous,\r\nand directs indigestion and everything of a flatulent nature to be\r\nguarded against.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the other Greek and Latin authorities, especially Aëtius,\r\ntreat of colic with admirable precision; but, as their remedial measures\r\nare much the same as those already mentioned, we shall not attempt to\r\ngive any account of them.\r\n\r\nSerapion’s divisions and treatment are nearly the same as our\r\nauthor’s. Avicenna, however, treats of the complaint more fully and\r\ncircumstantially than any other ancient author, but the length of his\r\ndescription prevents us from giving an abstract of it. We may mention,\r\nhowever, that when the pain is violent he approves of narcotics both by\r\nthe mouth and in clysters. Among the causes of colic mentioned by Haly\r\nAbbas is debility of the intestine, so that it can neither digest the\r\nfood nor evacuate it. Haly justly remarks that the inflammatory colic is\r\nthe worst species of the disease, for that in it the patient experiences\r\nno relief from evacuations, and the danger is imminent. With regard to\r\nthe treatment of it, he forbids purgatives, which do but increase the\r\nirritation; and recommends bleeding, emollient drinks, plasters, &c.\r\nIn flatulent colic his remedies are purgatives and carminatives, such\r\nas hiera with anise, fenugreek, cucumber, mastich, &c. In all cases\r\nhe approves much of clysters. Alsaharavius enumerates the following\r\ncauses of colic: A hot intemperament, hernia, indurated fæces, cold\r\nhumours impacted in the intestines, and the presence of some poisonous\r\nmedicine. We dare scarcely venture upon an exposition of the minutiæ\r\nof his treatment. When the disease is occasioned by retention of hard\r\nfæces, he recommends oily injections, baths, and diluent draughts. When\r\nit arises from gross humours, he agrees with Galen in approving of strong\r\nwine, clysters of dill, chamomile, fenugreek, and the like, boiled in\r\nwater. Rhases directs us to give emetics when the disease arises from\r\nindigestion. He probably alludes to duodenal disease. He mentions alvine\r\ncalculi and worms among the causes of colic. He particularly recommends\r\nthe warm bath and clysters.\r\n\r\nOur author’s interesting account of the epidemical colic is copied by\r\nAvicenna; but neither he nor any other subsequent authority supplies the\r\nsmallest additional information. Pliny seems to allude to an epidemical\r\ncolic which prevailed in the reign of Tiberius, but gives no satisfactory\r\naccount of it. (H.N. xxvi, 6.) The Jewish physician Moyses Alatinus\r\ngives the following description of a pestilential colic resembling that\r\ndescribed by Paulus and Avicenna: “Colicam, iliacamque, hujus generis,\r\n_contagiosas passiones_, quas hoc in loco refert Avicenna, memini me\r\nolim vidisse in civitate Mantuæ anno 1560, mensibus nimirum Augusti et\r\nSeptembris, quia publicè tunc temporis ejusmodi passiones contagiosæ per\r\nuniversam civitatem grassabantur, cum sævis symptomatibus, assiduo nempe,\r\nac urgente vomitu bilis porraceæ in magna copia, nec non etiam æruginosæ,\r\nlipothymia, assiduâ febre malignitatis non experte, ac siti immensâ, ac\r\nin eâdem familiâ plurimi eo morbo oppressi inveniebantur,” &c. (Marciæ\r\nPrælect. 276.) See Book Second, Sect. XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLIV.—ON ILEUS.\r\n\r\nIliac passion, being a very acute and painful complaint, has a symptom\r\nmore grievous even than dangerous; for those who are overpowered by\r\nthe disease die a most piteous death, vomiting up fæces at last by the\r\nmouth. The affection arises from indigestion and obstruction, when the\r\ncorrupted matters are retained, and from deleterious medicines, and from\r\na falling down of the bowels into the scrotum, and from inflammation of\r\nthe intestines, commonly supervening upon a colic affection. Wherefore\r\nchildren are to be cured by embrocations, cataplasms, clysters,\r\nsuppositories, and fomentations, as described when treating of colic. But\r\nyoung persons and adults are to be bled without delay, and the operation\r\nrepeated; and dry cupping is to be freely applied along the abdomen, and\r\ncupping even with scarifications to the affected parts. The extremities\r\nare to be rubbed and ligatures applied round them; and we must have\r\nrecourse to the most drastic clysters and enemata, putting the patients\r\ninto hip-baths of hot oil, giving antidotes, and purgatives; and simply\r\nall things, in short, which are applicable for colics, except when the\r\naffection of the colon proceeds from acrid and pungent humours. It has\r\na wonderful effect in this complaint to drink the decoction of dill,\r\neven if it should be vomited up; but after drinking it, dip bread in\r\nwarm water, and give the hot pieces of it to eat. For those who cannot\r\nretain their food, triturate sumach and cumin together, and give to\r\ndrink in oxymel to the amount of six cupfuls. Those who are attacked\r\nwith ileus from taking deleterious substances are to be compelled to\r\nvomit by drinking warm water (the symptoms arising from taking any of the\r\ndeleterious substances are detailed in the Fifth Book); and then they are\r\nto be made to drink warm oil, or fat soups, that they may again vomit;\r\nbut, after a certain number of days, they must drink the theriac. If the\r\nconstipation continue, the belly is to be evacuated by curds and whey\r\n(_schiston_), with a little scammony, aloes, or some other purgative.\r\nIf the complaint arise from the falling down of the intestine into the\r\nscrotum, we must put the patient into a reclining position with his feet\r\nelevated, and then we are to press the prolapsed intestine up to the\r\ngroin, and retain it with a bandage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Consult the authors referred to in the preceding Section.\r\n\r\nAmong other remedies for ileus, Hippocrates recommends inflating the\r\nbowels by means of a bellows. (De Morb. iii, 15.)\r\n\r\nAretæus gives an excellent account of the disease, the causes of which,\r\nas enumerated by him, are protracted indigestion of multifarious and\r\nunwonted food, a blow, exposure to cold, cold drink, and prolapsus of\r\nthe intestine into the scrotum, or intestinal hernia. Some, he says,\r\ndie from the violence of the pain, some from the conversion of the\r\ndisease into suppuration, and some from blackening and mortification\r\nof the bowels. The symptoms are most accurately described. There is at\r\nfirst vomiting of phlegm and bile, but latterly of fæces; the pulse at\r\nfirst is rare and small, but before death it becomes very small, very\r\ndense, and intermittent. When inflammation is the cause of the disease,\r\nhe approves of immediate venesection, so as to induce deliquium animi,\r\nwhich, he says, will, at all events, bring some respite to the patient’s\r\nsufferings. If inflammation is not present, venesection may be omitted,\r\nand an emetic of oil and water may be given; and afterwards applications\r\nare to be used for promoting the discharge of flatus, consisting of\r\nsow-bread, nitre, salts, and turpentine, which last medicine is also to\r\nbe administered in a clyster with oil, honey, hyssop, and colocynth;\r\nand afterwards another injection of hot oil and rue is to be given.\r\nExternally he applies various fomentations and dry cupping. He gives\r\ncarminatives with anodynes and the theriac. When the bowels cannot be\r\ngot opened otherwise, he recommends the purgative hiera. The food is to\r\nconsist of soups made from domestic fowls, with cumin, nitre, &c.; and,\r\nwhen there is no fever, he permits the use of hot wine.\r\n\r\nCelsus forbids wine, but his treatment otherwise is like that of Aretæus.\r\nHe directs immediate venesection and cupping; and, if the pain be seated\r\nabove the navel, he approves of emetics, but, if below, he agrees with\r\nErasistratus in preferring purgatives, such as ptisan, with oil and\r\nhoney. He directs us to apply cataplasms from the breast to the loins, to\r\nput the patient into a bath of oil, to inject hot oil per anum, and to\r\nuse friction of the extremities.\r\n\r\nOur author follows Aëtius and Oribasius closely, who, in their turn, are\r\nindebted to Galen.\r\n\r\nNonnus seems merely to abridge our author. The causes of ileus are said\r\nby him to be obstruction of the bowels, inflammation, indigestion, and\r\ncolic affections. His remedies for children are embrocations, cataplasms,\r\nand fomentations; and for adults, also venesection, cupping, clysters,\r\nand the oily bath. When the food is rejected, he recommends sumach and\r\ncumin in oxymel, and also purgatives.\r\n\r\nIt appears from Cælius Aurelianus that Diocles had been in the practice\r\nof giving a leaden bullet to swallow in this disease, no doubt with the\r\nsame intention that quicksilver is now sometimes administered. In the\r\npreceding Section, we have mentioned that Alexander gave pills of lead\r\nfor colic. Cælius, however, disapproves of this practice. He finds fault\r\nwith Hippocrates for recommending to inflate the bowels with smoke; for\r\ngiving emetics; and for cooling the upper parts of the body. He himself\r\napproves of bleeding, oily clysters, baths of oil, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians, like the Greeks, treat ileus by venesection, clysters,\r\nand so forth. They mention cooling plasters as an external application;\r\nbut we believe it was the practice of the ancients rather to use hot\r\nfomentations than cold in this disease. Haly Abbas in general approves\r\nof venesection, but, in certain cases arising from a cold cause, he\r\njoins Hippocrates in permitting the use of wine. When the disease is\r\noccasioned by obstruction, he recommends laxatives; when connected with\r\ndescent of the gut, he directs us to return it, but says nothing of the\r\noperation for strangulated hernia. According to Rhases, the causes of\r\nileus are inflammation of the bowels, debility of the expulsive faculty,\r\nand indurated fæces.\r\n\r\nVegetius, the veterinary surgeon, gives an excellent account of the\r\nsymptoms and treatment of colic and ileus in cattle. (Mulomedicina, i,\r\n41, 42.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLV.—ON AFFECTIONS OF THE KIDNEYS AND BLADDER; AND, FIRST, ON\r\nCALCULUS.\r\n\r\nThe alliance of these diseases obliges us to break through the order\r\nof instruction; for it is a common symptom of colic and of calculus\r\nin the kidney, that the belly is at first constipated, with violent\r\npain, anorexia, indigestion, and tormina. But it is peculiar to colic\r\naffections to have all these symptoms more intense, whereas in nephritic\r\nthey are less so; and in colics the pain is rather in the right loin, and\r\nascends to the stomach, liver, and spleen; and the passage of the fæces\r\nis completely obstructed, so that not even flatus can pass; or, when with\r\ndifficulty the fæces are evacuated, they are flatulent, and resemble the\r\ndung of oxen, or sometimes a vitreous phlegm is discharged, and the urine\r\nis voided freely, and is of a pituitous nature: whereas, in nephritic\r\ncases, there is a severe fixed pain in the kidneys, as if transfixed with\r\na sharp-pointed instrument, and the corresponding testicle is pained, and\r\nthere is torpor in the thigh of the same side. They also have sometimes,\r\nthough rarely, spontaneous evacuations of the belly; but clysters always\r\nbring away flatus and bilious fæces; the urine is in small quantity and\r\nsandy, and the urinary passage is contracted. These are the symptoms of\r\nstones in the kidneys, which occur most frequently in adults, but the\r\nstones in the bladder form rather in boys. The symptoms of these are,\r\nunconcocted and whitish urine, with a sandy sediment; the patients rub\r\nconstantly and handle the member, stretch it, and make incessant attempts\r\nto pass water, and are troubled with strangury. Wherefore the material\r\ncause of the formation of stones is a thick and terrene humour, but the\r\nefficient is a fiery heat of the kidneys or bladder. But with regard to\r\nthe kidneys, we must use lithontriptics of a cutting nature, without\r\nbeing decidedly heating: such are the roots of the royal asparagus and of\r\nthe bramble, burnt glass, the root of couch-grass, maiden-hair, bdellium,\r\nthe rind of the root of the bay, the seeds of marshmallows, the black\r\nchick-pea, the stones of sponges, vinegar of squills, and valerian,\r\nspignel, asarabacca, carpesia, saxifrage, water-parsnip, when eaten or\r\ndrank, the golden-thistle (_scolymus_), hedge-mustard, and prionitis.\r\nLet them use baths constantly; and after the bath take some of the\r\nafore-mentioned things; and have recourse to embrocations, cataplasms,\r\nfomentations, hip-baths of a soothing nature; in short, applying the\r\nremedies for colics. The following are compound draughts: Boil the roots\r\nof wild rue, wild mallows, and parsley, with wine; mix the expressed\r\njuice with water, and give to the amount of two cyathi. And this is\r\na powder: Of the fruit of balsam, of the stone in sponges, of dried\r\npennyroyal, of the seeds of wild mallows, equal parts. Give a spoonful\r\nwith two cupfuls of diluted wine. Also, dried goat’s blood, dried cicadæ\r\nwithout the wings and feet, the Jew’s stone, in oxymel. Let these things\r\nbe given in the warm bath, and the compound medicines prepared from\r\nthem, the nephritic sour wine (_posca_), and the wines prepared for this\r\nintention. And the troglodytes (_wren?_) is a much-commended remedy. It\r\nis of all the sparrow tribe the least, except that called the regulus;\r\nfor it is a little larger than this one alone, and resembles it in\r\ncolour, which is intermediate between that of ashes and green. It has\r\na slender bill, and lives mostly in walls and hedges. When, therefore,\r\nthis bird is pickled whole, and frequently eaten in a raw state, it\r\nmakes the stones which are already formed be passed with the urine, and\r\nprevents them from being formed again; and if it be burnt alive entire\r\nwith its wings, and if the ashes by itself and along with pepper and a\r\nmoderate quantity of Indian leaf, be drunk out of mulse, it will do the\r\nsame thing. To relieve the acuteness of the pains and the want of sleep,\r\nthe medicine called Sotira and that of Philo, are excellent remedies;\r\nand frequent venesection, if had recourse to, alleviates the pain, and\r\nproduces a speedy discharge of the stone. The preservatives from the\r\nformation of stones are, first, wholesome and moderate food, exercise,\r\nabstinence from the frequent use of all kinds of pulse and food of\r\ngrain, cheese, milk, and condiments prepared from dark-coloured wine,\r\nmuch flesh, and simply all things which contain thick juices; also from\r\nthose things which are very hot and acrid, I mean hydrogarum, prepared\r\nwines, and the like. And the following things not only prevent stones\r\nfrom forming, but also break down or produce the discharge of those\r\nwhich are already formed. Let them drink oxymel with some of the simpler\r\ndiuretics, the decoction of maiden-hair, parsley, and couch-grass; and,\r\nafter the bath, let them drink tepid water before taking food or drinking\r\nwine; and in the midst of dinner, let them drink cold water if nothing\r\nprevent it. If they feel a collection of vitiated humours, let them\r\nevacuate by bleeding or purging. But the most effectual of all remedies\r\nis to drink water of a middling temperature after the bath, and before\r\ntaking food or wine. The stones which form in the bladders of young\r\npersons you may destroy by the more powerful remedies, making choice from\r\namong the above mentioned. But when the stone gets too large, or becomes\r\nimpacted at the neck of the bladder, we must have recourse to concussion,\r\ncatheterism, or even lithotomy, as will be described in the Surgical part\r\nof the work.\r\n\r\n_On inflammation._ If there be inflammation of the kidneys or bladder,\r\nit is to be recognized by the heat in the place, attended with heaviness\r\nand pain, fever, delirium, vomiting of pure bile, and inability to make\r\nwater, more especially if the bladder is inflamed. Wherefore we must\r\nhave recourse immediately to venesection, and use soothing fomentations\r\nand cataplasms from rue, dill, fenugreek, and the root of marshmallows;\r\nalso emollient clysters and injections consisting of oil, poppies, and\r\nthe grease of geese; and when the bladder is affected, we may push up\r\nthe anus half an obolus of opium with myrrh, saffron, and oil. They may\r\ntake a sweet draught of honied water, but must abstain from the strong\r\ndiuretics and much drink, unless an acrid and bilious humour prevail,\r\nwhen they must take copious draughts, and plenty of the non-stimulant\r\ndiuretics. Let them take in water a spoonful of a mixture consisting of\r\ntwo parts of linseed, and one of starch; and likewise let them take the\r\nseeds of cucumber and pompion. If there is a sensation of great heat\r\nabout the kidneys, apply to these parts rags out of wine and rose-oil,\r\nwater and rose-oil, or oil of apples; or a cerate composed of wax,\r\nrose-oil, oil of chamomile; or oil of apples, and the yelks of eggs, with\r\na little vinegar, or the juice of knot-grass. Afterwards they may use the\r\ndiachylon plaster with oil of chamomile; but must abstain from very hot\r\napplications, lest they occasion suppuration; and from very cold, for\r\nthereby the kidneys will readily become scirrhous. During the violence of\r\nthe inflammation they must abstain from baths, and use the regimen called\r\nthe febrile and anti-inflammatory.\r\n\r\n_On abscess and ulceration of the urinary organs._ Pains in the loins,\r\nanomalous rigours, and irregular fevers indicate an aposteme in the\r\nkidneys; but when it is in the bladder, it is marked by pain in that part\r\nin addition to the symptoms we have now mentioned. You may ascertain\r\nwhich kidney is affected from this, that when the person lies upon the\r\nsound side he has pain in the opposite one, from the diseased kidney\r\nbeing suspended. In these cases we must place the patients in hip-baths\r\nof oil and water, apply cataplasms of fine flour, oil, and rosin, or\r\nthe flour of tares with honey, or cardamom, or pigeon’s dung with dried\r\nfigs. Pus freely discharged in the urine indicates a rupture of the\r\nabscess and ulceration in the part. But since the urinary organs are\r\nulcerated without an aposteme, from the rupture of a vessel, erosion by\r\nacrid matter, or the irritation of a stone, we may distinguish ulceration\r\nin the kidneys from that in the bladder or urethra in this way: When\r\nthe kidneys are ulcerated, the patient experiences a heavy pain in the\r\nloins, he makes water freely, and pus is found mixed with the urine, and\r\nparticles of flesh floating in it. When the bladder is in a state of\r\nulceration, the patient has violent pain in the region of the pubes and\r\nhypogastrium, and difficulty of making water; the pus, after the urine is\r\nvoided, sinks to the bottom, and fetid scales, or else foliaceous ones\r\nfloat in it. Furfuraceous sediments indicate scabies of the bladder. When\r\nthe ureters are ulcerated, the mixture of the pus is in an intermediate\r\ndegree, and rather resembles hairs floating in the urine; and the\r\nsituation of the pain is intermediate between the kidneys and bladder.\r\nIf blood or pus be discharged without any evacuation of urine, it is\r\nto be understood that none of the afore-mentioned parts are ulcerated,\r\nbut the member itself. Wherefore to those who have ulceration of the\r\nurinary organs we must give the sweet draughts of honied water, or of\r\nthe decoction of fenugreek with honey, or from the seeds of cucumber\r\nwith must. To those who void pus in their urine we are to give Armenian\r\nbole, or the ashes of burnt reeds, as much as can be taken up with three\r\nfingers, in must; and drinking milk is an excellent remedy for them. The\r\nfollowing are compound remedies: Of linseed, of the seed of cucumber, of\r\ntragacanth, of each, dr. ij; form trochisks.—_Another_: Twenty pine-nuts;\r\nforty seeds of the garden cucumber; of starch, dr. j; add to two heminæ\r\nof the decoction of nard and parsley seed. But Archigenes, in his epistle\r\nto Atticus, says that “when the dysuria is urgent, we should take of\r\nthe powdered seed of toasted poppy, dr. j, which is to be sprinkled\r\nupon the decoction of bog-rush, sweet-rush, or liquorice. This medicine\r\nremoves the pains from ulceration: Of the seeds of purified cucumber,\r\nxxx in number; pine-nuts, xij in number; bitter almonds, whitened, xxxv\r\nin number; of saffron, what is sufficient to give it colour; give to the\r\npatient with an empty stomach every day, along with the wine _protropum_,\r\nor milk. It will be milder, if, instead of the pine-nuts, it receive\r\nan equal quantity of the seeds of mallows. The cyphi and the cyphoid\r\nantidotes are also said to cure ulcerations in the bladder. I, in the\r\nmore protracted cases, by using this medicine, have not stood in need\r\nof more complex remedies: Of wall-germander, of ground pine, of each,\r\ndr. xxiv; of asarabacca, of white pepper, of each, dr. vij; of cinnamon,\r\ndr. j. Of this medicine, finely powdered, I give two spoonfuls in Cretan\r\nsweet wine; but if there is fever, in three cyathi of water; but when the\r\nulceration is attended with pain, by adding two cyathi of starch, and\r\nfifteen seeds of cucumber, I accomplish my purpose.” These things are\r\nfrom the works of Archigenes. And the remedies formed from alkekengi, the\r\nantidote from the seed of wild mallows, and that from sweet-meats are\r\nexcellent. We may apply to the perinæum and lower belly cerates made from\r\nwashed hyssop and butter, and the grease of geese, and storax; and we may\r\ninject into the bladder, by means of a small syringe, honied water much\r\ndiluted, or milk with some honey, or with cucumber seed, or the white of\r\nan egg with pompholyx, or some of the remedies formerly mentioned. When\r\nthe ulcer is spreading, the trochisk from paper must be injected, or\r\nthe Bithynian; and cataplasms are to be applied, made from dates, dried\r\ngrapes, with galls, acacia, hypocistis, and alum.\r\n\r\n_On hemorrhage of the kidneys._ The kidneys often getting into a relaxed\r\nstate, cannot retain the urine, but, becoming dilated, they allow the\r\nblood and other thick matters to escape from the veins. The kidneys\r\noften discharge blood periodically like hemorrhoids; and when evacuated\r\nthey are relieved, in which cases we must not rashly interfere, if\r\nthe bleeding immediately stops; but, if it continue, we must bleed\r\nin the arm, and use for hemorrhage of the kidneys and bladder those\r\nremedies which are recommended for hemoptysis and other hemorrhages;\r\nand, more especially, we must give the root of comfrey and tragacanth\r\nmacerated in wine, the juice of knotgrass and plantain with oxycrate,\r\nor bitter almonds with must; or this medicine: Of fissile alum, dr. j;\r\nof tragacanth, dr. ij; of gum, oboli, v; with must. And we must apply\r\na cataplasm of raw barley-meal with oxycrate or rose-oil, or that from\r\ndates, and bread of siligo with acacia, or hypocistis boiled in an\r\nastringent wine or oxycrate. In hemorrhages from the bladder, we must\r\napply cupping instruments to the loins and ischium; and we must ascertain\r\nthe part from which the blood flows by the pain in the place, and whether\r\nthe blood be mixed with the urine or no, as was said with regard to pus.\r\nIf there be coagulated blood in the bladder (which you may know from the\r\nflow of urine being suddenly stopped after a discharge of bloody urine,\r\nand from certain clots or bloody fluids being probably passed), give\r\nthe decoction of mugwort to drink, and the seed of shrubby-everlasting,\r\nof fleabane, or of radish, or the juice of laserwort, or the Cyrenaic\r\njuice, or the juice of parsley, each mixed with vinegar, or the rennet of\r\na hare, or of a hind, or of a kid, in oxymel, or strained lye with oil,\r\nand externally sponges out of hot salt water, or strained lye, must be\r\napplied. But, if they are not dissolved, we must make an incision in the\r\nperineum, as in the cases of calculus; and having removed the clots of\r\nblood, accomplish the cure in a proper manner.\r\n\r\n_On hardness of the kidneys._ When hardness occurs in the kidneys, it\r\ndoes not occasion pains, but they seem, as it were, to hang from the\r\nloins, and the haunches are torpid, and the limbs lose their strength,\r\nlittle urine is passed, and the whole habit resembles that of dropsical\r\npersons. Wherefore they are to be softened by cerates, emollient\r\nointments, friction and fomentations; and we must administer diuretics,\r\nand clear out the bowels by clysters.\r\n\r\n_On diabetes._ Diabetes is a rapid passage of the drink out of the\r\nbody, liquids being voided by urine as they were drank; and hence it\r\nis attended with immoderate thirst; and therefore the affection has\r\nbeen called dipsacus, being occasioned by a weakness of the retentive\r\nfaculty of the kidneys, while the attractive is increased in strength,\r\nand deprives the whole body of its moisture by its immoderate heat.\r\nWherefore with this intention we will give more food, and that of\r\ndifficult digestion and not humid, such as alica with rose-wine, or\r\nrhodomel, or hydromel, or some wine that is not old, or some of the\r\nhot wines. We must give of pot-herbs, succory, endive, and lettuces;\r\nof fishes, those that abide among rocks; the feet and womb of swine;\r\npears, apples, and pomegranates; and give cold water to drink. They must\r\nget to drink propomata, from the juice of knotgrass, and elicampane, in\r\ndark-coloured wine, and from the decoction of dates and myrtles. We must\r\napply a cataplasm to the hypochondrium and kidneys of polenta, in vinegar\r\nand rose-oil; and of the leaves of the vine and navelwort, pellitory of\r\nthe wall, and purslain. We must promote sweats, and excite vomiting by\r\ndrinking cold water; and make them abstain from all sorts of diuretics.\r\nThere will be nothing improper in letting blood at the commencement.\r\n\r\n_On strangury and dysuria._ When neither inflammation, nor a stone, nor\r\nany of the afore-mentioned complaints are present, if there is acrimony\r\nin the urine, and if the whole habit or the other symptoms indicate bile,\r\nthe dysuria or strangury is formed by it, and we are to use medicines\r\nfor altering and diluting it; the juice of ptisan, fishes, baths, and a\r\ncorresponding diet; avoiding acrid things, wine, baths, anger, and long\r\nabstinence from food. If the thinness and whiteness of the urine, and the\r\nother symptoms indicate a cold intemperament, hot wine and prepared wines\r\nwill be proper; also diuretic food and medicines, and hot hip-baths.\r\nWhen, in conjunction with the whiteness, the urine appears thicker than\r\nnatural, we are to suspect a pituitous humour obstructing the neck of\r\nthe bladder, and must use oxymel, and the compositions from hyssop\r\nand pennyroyal, or marjoram, or thyme, or laserwort, boiled in honied\r\nwater, and the hotter embrocations. But, if a thick humour, a stone, a\r\nthrombus, or some such obstruction stop up the passage of the urine, we\r\nmust apply the catheter to them, unless inflammation of the part be\r\npresent. Dysuria in fevers is to be cured by an embrocation with oil of\r\nrue, of dill, or old oil. When the bowels are constipated, a decoction of\r\nfenugreek or mallows is to be injected, and the patient made to sit in\r\noil and water, or in some of the afore-mentioned decoctions, with oil.\r\nAnd this cerate will be proper for them: The roots of wild mallows are to\r\nbe boiled in Sicyonian oil, with a little water, until they are dried,\r\nand they are to be thrown away; and with the oil is to be mixed of the\r\njuice of rue a fourth part, and of wax and castor a sufficient quantity.\r\n\r\n_On paralysis of the bladder._ This complaint, which is sometimes\r\naccompanied with dysuria, and sometimes with an involuntary discharge of\r\nwater, has been formerly treated of under the head of Paralysis.\r\n\r\n_On incontinence of urine._ Relaxation of the muscle at the neck of\r\nthe bladder occasions this affection, and therefore it happens most\r\nfrequently to children. Our general treatment ought to consist especially\r\nof tonics, such as hot wine and oil, and the like, abstaining from all\r\nthings which are powerfully refrigerant, and rather as much as possible\r\nusing calefacients; for cold produces a resemblance to paralysis. The\r\nfollowing things are naturally efficacious: Burn the crop of a cock,\r\nand give to the patient to drink in tepid water, when fasting, or the\r\nflowers of the white ox-eye (_chrysanthemum_) in like manner; or, shave\r\ndown the testicle of a hare into fragrant wine, and give to drink; or,\r\ngive calamint and myrrh in a draught before supper; or, give the toasted\r\nseed of the wild rue to drink every third day. Let the privy member\r\nbe anointed with Cimolian earth, mixed with the juice of perdicias\r\n(_pellitory of the wall?_)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. On these diseases consult Hippocrates (Aphor. iv, 76; de\r\nMorb. Intern. 15, et alibi); Galen (de Med. sec. loc. x; de Affect.\r\nRenum; de Loc. Affect.; Isagoge); Celsus (iv, 10); Aretæus (Morb. Acut.\r\nii, 9; Morb. Acut. Curat. ii, 8); Ruffus Ephesius (de Vesicæ Renumque\r\nAffectibus); Alexander (viii, 4); Aëtius (xi); Oribasius (de Loc. Affect.\r\nCurat. iv, 101); Actuarius (Meth. Med. iv, 8); Pseudo-Dioscor. (Euporist.\r\nii, 112); Nonnus (173); Cælius Aurelianus (Morb. Chron. v, 4); Scribonius\r\nLargus (38); Marcellus (de Med. 24); Avicenna (iii, 19, 1); Avenzoar\r\n(ii, 2); Serapion (iv); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix, 34; Pract. vii, 12);\r\nAlsaharavius (Pract. xx); Rhases (Div. 70, and Contin. xxiii.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates describes four affections of the kidneys, beginning with\r\ncalculus. According to his theory, stones are formed from phlegm which\r\nhas been converted into sand. See his theory fully explained (de Morbis,\r\niv, 28, and de Aer. &c. 53.) He states distinctly that the formation of\r\nstones is the product of a preternatural heat in the bladder, with a\r\nthick and turbid state of the urine. (l. c.) He recommends fomentations\r\nwith the juice of scammony, purging the whole body, tepid baths, and the\r\nlike. He intimates, however, that when a stone is fairly formed, the only\r\nhopes of recovery are founded upon the operation. It appears that in\r\nhis days lithotomy was a separate branch of the profession; for in his\r\n_Oath_ he inhibits his pupils from performing the operation, and binds\r\nthem to leave it to those who make it their practice. Doubts, however,\r\nare entertained of the genuineness of this piece. He mentions that hairs\r\nare sometimes passed in the urine; and the same fact is attested by\r\nGalen (Loc. Affect. vi, 3), Cælius Aurelianus, Aëtius, Avicenna, and\r\nAlsaharavius, among the ancients, and by recent writers on pathology.\r\nActuarius calls them substances resembling hairs, of a handbreadth or\r\nthereabout in length. (De Urinis, i, 16.) He held them to be connected\r\nwith disease of the kidneys. (Ibid. iv, 20.)\r\n\r\nGalen says that all lithontriptics are of a cutting and detergent nature,\r\nthe most of them being bitters. He makes mention of pepper, galbanum,\r\nammoniac, aphronitrum, asarabacca, spignel, St. John’s wort, &c. He does\r\nnot hesitate, however, to declare it as his opinion that the only certain\r\nremedy for calculus is lithotomy. (Art. Med. 94.)\r\n\r\nAretæus gives an interesting account of the affections of the kidneys\r\nand bladder. His remedies are similar to those of our author. For stones\r\nin the bladder he recommends, among other things, some quicklime with\r\nhonied water, and diuretics. When a stone obstructs the passage, he\r\ndirects us to push it back, or cut the neck of the bladder. He states\r\nthat navigation and living at sea are beneficial in all affections of the\r\nkidneys. We may mention that this accords well with the late statistics\r\nof calculous diseases.\r\n\r\nAlexander, like our author, ascribes the formation of stones to viscid\r\nand thick humours which have been much heated or roasted. He says, in\r\nthe language of the Peripatetic philosophy, that the material cause of\r\ncalculus is a thick matter, but the efficient a fiery heat, in like\r\nmanner as by heat and a suitable matter of such a nature tiles are formed\r\nwhich are insoluble in water. This theory is explained with great logical\r\nparade in the ‘Isagoge’ generally ascribed to Galen, but which Albertus\r\nFabricius supposes to be a work of Demetrius Pepagomenos. Alexander’s\r\nremedies are mostly the same as our author’s. He speaks with surprising\r\nconfidence of the efficacy of goats’ blood; and, by the way, there is\r\nno lithontriptic which, both in ancient and in modern times, has been\r\nso generally cried up as it. His general treatment, which consists of\r\nbleeding, baths, emollient and paregoric medicines, is very proper. He\r\nremarks that certain lithontriptics, if given unseasonably, increase the\r\ndisposition to calculus. Like our author, he forbids thick food, and\r\nattributes the best effects to drinking water.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to see a full exposition of the ancient views on this\r\nsubject may consult Aëtius. Like all the others, he says that milk,\r\nwith the exception of that of asses, contributes to the formation of\r\nstones. He also recommends goats’ blood. He gives very proper directions\r\nrespecting the regimen after extraction of the stone, to prevent a\r\nrecurrence of the complaint.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus makes no mention of lithontriptics, but he describes\r\nvery properly the treatment when pain and inflammation of the bladder\r\nsupervene. It is altogether emollient and relaxant.\r\n\r\nThe nature and treatment of calculous diseases are treated of in a very\r\npractical manner by Palladius in his Commentary on the sixth ‘Epidem.\r\nHippocrat.’ He depends principally upon a restricted diet and light food.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians treat of calculi at great length, but have the same ideas of\r\nthe formation of them, and recommend the same remedies as the Greeks. We\r\nremark that Avicenna, Rhases, Serapion, and Alsaharavius mention among\r\ntheir lithontriptics _barauch_, or the _nitrum_ of the Greeks and Romans,\r\nwhich was most probably an impure carbonate of soda. We need scarcely\r\nsay that this alkali is now given upon chemical principles. Like our\r\nauthor, they make mention of glass as a lithontriptic. Rhases, Avicenna,\r\nand some of the others remark, and perhaps justly, that white urine\r\nis one of the earliest symptoms of calculus. For stone in the bladder\r\nAvenzoar recommends cubebs. Avicenna, Serapion, and Alsaharavius join\r\nthe Greeks in commending the small sparrow (or, as some suppose it, the\r\nwren) as an efficacious remedy for calculus. It is said in the ‘Isagoge’\r\nthat its lithontriptic powers were discovered by dreams. We may mention\r\nthat it has been ingeniously supposed that allusion is here made to\r\nmagnetic somnambulism, which, it is maintained, was one of the remedial\r\nmeans practised in the ancient temples of health. Haly Abbas ascribes\r\nthe formation of stones to the concurrence of a viscid humour with\r\nheat of the part. Old men, he says, are most subject to renal calculi;\r\nfor in them the watery part of the urine passes down to the bladder,\r\nwhile the grosser part or sediment is detained in the kidneys, and is\r\nconverted into stones. Children are said to be most liable to calculi in\r\nthe bladder, owing to their eating much gross food, and taking exercise\r\nafter meals, by which means the system is loaded with gross impurities.\r\nWith regard to the treatment, he enjoins restricted diet, abstinence\r\nfrom gross food, and the use of medicines of an incisive and attenuant\r\nnature. The general treatment during a fit of gravel is well laid down by\r\nAlsaharavius, consisting of bleeding, cupping, the tepid bath, emollient\r\nclysters, &c. Rhases, upon the authority of Antyllus, states that stones\r\nare formed either from drinking turbid water or from imperfect digestion,\r\nwhence the urine deposits a sediment, which is converted into a stony\r\nhardness by the heat of the part.\r\n\r\nAccording to Theophilus, a thick and milky state of the urine is\r\ncharacteristic of calculous diathesis. (De Urin. 8.)\r\n\r\nVegetius mentions that cattle, especially young ones, are liable to\r\nstones in the bladder, which are apt to fall into the urethra and\r\nobstruct the urine. He states correctly that a stone will sometimes make\r\nits way into the rectum. (Mulom. i, 46.)\r\n\r\nAlexander Aphrodisiensis states that young and old persons are most\r\nsubject to calculus. (Prob. i.) From the late investigation of Dr. Prout,\r\nit appears that children until fourteen years of age are most liable to\r\nstone; then persons after forty; while those in the intermediate period\r\nare but little subject to the complaint.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the lithontriptics mentioned above, all we can venture\r\nto say is, that, having no experience of them, we do not think ourselves\r\nentitled to question or confirm their efficacy decidedly; but, as we\r\nrepose little confidence in those now in repute, we cannot be supposed to\r\nhave much in those which have fallen into disuse.\r\n\r\n_On inflammation, abscess, and ulceration of the urinary organs._ Celsus\r\nrecommends rest; a soft bed; opening the belly; sitting in hot water;\r\navoiding cold food and drink; abstinence from everything that is saltish,\r\nacrid, and acid, and from apples; taking copious draughts; adding to the\r\nfood or drink pepper, leeks, fennel-giant, and white poppy, to promote\r\nthe urinary discharge, &c.\r\n\r\nOne may find in Galen many receipts for abscess and ulceration of the\r\nurinary passages, but they are similar to our author’s.\r\n\r\nAretæus makes mention of ulcers of the kidney occasioned by stones,\r\nwhich he pronounces to be incurable. He states also that ulcers of the\r\nkidneys give rise to consumption. Without doubt he alludes to the morbid\r\ncondition of the kidneys now known by the name of Bright’s disease.\r\nHippocrates has been supposed to refer to the same in the following\r\nAphorism: “When bubbles appear on the surface of the urine, they indicate\r\nthat the kidneys are affected, and that the disease will be protracted.”\r\n(Aph. vii, 34.) Upon which MM. Lallemand and Pappas remark that _frothy_\r\nurine and _albuminous_ are identical; and it is well known that Bright,\r\nRayer, and Martin Solon have decided that albuminous urine is generally\r\nconnected with a very obstinate disease of the kidneys. (Littré’s\r\nHippocrates, t. iv, 414.) It seems highly probable that Actuarius alludes\r\nto albuminous urine in the following passage: “When substances, the\r\neffect of melting, and resembling spiders’ webs, float in the urine, they\r\nindicate either that the kidneys are diseased, or that the system is in\r\na state of atrophy from wasting.” (De Urinis, vi, 16.) On frothy urine,\r\nsee, further ‘De Urin.’ (v, 4.)\r\n\r\nAlexander lays down the rules of treatment very properly, recommending\r\nvenesection, purging, and topical applications of a cooling nature,\r\nespecially at the commencement. When the abscess forms, he prescribes a\r\nvariety of things which are detergent without pungency.\r\n\r\nWhen the bladder is ulcerated, Nonnus directs us to inject into it by a\r\nsyringe honey much diluted with water, or the seed of cucumber with the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThe treatment prescribed by Cælius Aurelianus scarcely differs at all\r\nfrom that of the others in this case.\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest writers on diseases of the kidneys is Ruffus, who\r\nlived, according to Suidas, in the days of Trajan; so that he was prior\r\nto Galen, and perhaps to Aretæus and Cælius Aurelianus. As we have\r\nseldom occasion to meet with him in our researches, we shall give a\r\nfuller abstract of his opinions on this subject than we would otherwise\r\nhave done. The symptoms of inflammation of the kidneys, as detailed by\r\nhim, are pains below the loins, so that the patient cannot stand erect\r\nnor walk, but is obliged to lie upon his back, which position affords\r\nhim most relief; the pains extending to the bladder and testicles; the\r\nextremities cold, more especially the legs and feet; frequent and painful\r\ndesire to make urine, which is at first thin and watery, but afterwards\r\nbecomes redder. These symptoms are followed by emaciation of the thighs\r\nand hips, debility of the limbs, and sometimes suppuration. His treatment\r\nis as follows: The patient is to be laid on a soft couch, and must\r\nabstain from food for one day, but long abstinence is forbidden. If the\r\nbowels require to be opened, this is to be done by means of emollient\r\nclysters, such as injections of hot water, decoctions of mallows,\r\nof linseed, or of fenugreek, to which may be added some oil. Large\r\ninjections, however, are forbidden, lest they press upon the kidneys and\r\noccasion irritation. When the bowels are evacuated, and yet the pain\r\ndoes not remit, the parts may be wrapped in wool which is smeared with\r\nhot oil having rue, marshmallows, dill, or mugwort boiled in it. When\r\nthe pain is acute, a vein at the elbow is to be opened; after which\r\nemollient cataplasms and plasters are to be applied to the back when the\r\nkidneys are affected, and to the fore parts when the bladder. When these\r\nremedies fail to remove the pain, the loins and groins are to be cupped,\r\nand then sponges squeezed out of hot water are to be applied, and the\r\npatient put into a hip-bath of hot water in which poppies, chamomile,\r\nand the like have been boiled. Then, when the patient is laid in bed,\r\nlet him be fomented with bladders half-filled with oil and water; and\r\nafterwards let cerates of the oil of privet, &c. or fragrant malagmata be\r\napplied. When the pain is excruciating, he directs us to give a decoction\r\ncontaining opium and the heads of poppies. In due time diuretics are\r\nto be administered, such as the root of acorus, ground-pine, cassia,\r\nspignel, parsley, sea urchins, radishes, carrots, and the like. When an\r\nabscess is formed, there is a discharge of tawny and more natural urine,\r\nthere is swelling in the loins, strong heat in the kidneys, and the pain\r\nbecomes duller with irregular fever. The abscess bursts either into the\r\nbladder or intestines. Praxagoras, he says, related a case in which there\r\nwas pus voided by the anus for twelve years and probably longer. When\r\nit bursts into the bladder, pus is voided with the urine. Suppuration\r\nis to be promoted by frequent fomentations with sponges, by cataplasms\r\nof barley-meal with a decoction of figs in mead or wine, to which may\r\nbe added pounded wormwood, spurge, &c. For promoting the rupture of the\r\nabscess, diuretics are prescribed, such as wild marjoram, mock dittany,\r\nand the like. When the abscess does not burst, acrid clysters containing\r\nblack hellebore, radishes, garlic, and the pulp of colocynth are to be\r\ngiven. To these oil may be added, and when thus taken they will promote\r\nthe rupture of the abscess. However, fomentations with sponges and\r\nplasters are to be applied to alienate the pain. When the ulcers are of a\r\nmild nature (which is shown by the abatement of the fever and pain, and\r\nfrom the substances which appear in the urine being white and inodorous),\r\nthe milder diuretics are to be used for cleansing them, such as the\r\nseed of pompion, the decoction of dates, &c.; or, when stronger things\r\nare required, galbanum, opopanax, turpentine rosin, and the like may be\r\nadded to mead or wine. When the ulcers are putrid, Æthiopian cumin with\r\nmust, rue with honey and wine, and the like may be given internally;\r\nwhile cataplasms of bitter vetches boiled in wine and honey are to be\r\napplied externally. It is proper also, he says, to inject some of the\r\nmedicines for dysentery; to give clysters of strained ptisan; and to\r\nplace the patient in hot water. If the matter is thick, a decoction of\r\nfennel, parsley, or wormwood is to be given. With respect to food, he\r\nrecommends milk, especially that of mares or asses, along with honey;\r\nalso cucumbers, lettuces, the flesh of kids, lambs, and goats, almonds,\r\nand wine; but vinegar must be avoided. All motion is to be abstained\r\nfrom. When there are symptoms of repletion, emetics are to be given. When\r\nthe abscess points outwardly, he seems to direct us to open it and apply\r\nthe cautery; but here unfortunately the text is incomplete.\r\n\r\nThis account is so full and judicious that we think it unnecessary to\r\ngive extracts from any more of the Greek and Latin authorities.\r\n\r\nFrom the Arabians little or no additional information is to be derived.\r\nHaly Abbas recommends bleeding by opening the basilic vein, and then\r\ncataplasms of barley-flour, &c. He then gives a cooling draught\r\ncontaining the seeds of cucumbers, gourds, melons with purslain,\r\nmallows, and the syrup of violets. This part of his practice deserves\r\nconsideration. When the abscess forms he directs us to apply cataplasms\r\ncontaining chamomile, fenugreek, melilot, &c. Alsaharavius, in like\r\nmanner, recommends bleeding, cooling and demulcent draughts, the tepid\r\nbath, and discutient cataplasms. The same plan of treatment is fully\r\nlaid down by Rhases. When pus is discharged from the bladder, owing to\r\nulceration of it, he directs us to give astringent injections prepared\r\nfrom galls, sumach, purslain, pomegranate leaves, &c.\r\n\r\n_On hemorrhage of the kidneys._ Our author’s treatment is so fully\r\nstated that it will be unnecessary to multiply extracts from the others.\r\nIt is mostly condensed from Aëtius. (xi, 27.) The latter makes mention\r\nof injecting into the bladder some astringent infusion by means of an\r\ninstrument like a catheter, having a bladder attached to one extremity.\r\nWhen the coagulated blood (and the urine generally does coagulate it)\r\ncannot be got otherwise discharged, he recommends, like our author, an\r\nincision to be made in the perinæum.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus also recommends injecting into the bladder some\r\nastringent infusion, such as that of hypocistis, knot-grass, &c. In the\r\ncase of women astringent pessaries may be used.\r\n\r\nAvicenna recommends us to inject the rennet of a hare. Haly Abbas directs\r\nus to bleed by opening the basilic vein, and then to give draughts\r\ncontaining various vegetable astringents, such as wild pomegranate\r\nflowers, cucumbers, and purslain, with alum, Cyprian earth, &c. According\r\nto Rhases, the discharge of blood by urine is often connected with\r\ndisease of the liver.\r\n\r\nThe veterinary surgeon Vegetius ascribes the bloody water of cattle to\r\ngeneral plethora. This is a very plausible hypothesis.\r\n\r\n_On hardness of the kidneys._ Nearly the same account is given by\r\nAëtius, and also by Avicenna, Rhases, Serapion, and all the medical\r\nauthorities who have treated of this subject. Haly Abbas and Alsaharavius\r\nparticularly commend the diachylon plaster. Ruffus, as quoted by\r\nRhases, recommends rest, emollient clysters, the application of\r\ncupping-instruments to the back, tepid baths, refrigerant and sedative\r\nmedicines internally.\r\n\r\n_On diabetes._ Aretæus remarks that diabetes is a wonderful affection,\r\nbeing a melting down of the flesh into urine, occasioned by a cold and\r\nhumid cause like dropsy. The disease, he says, is of slow formation,\r\nbut when completely formed speedily proves fatal. His description of\r\nthe symptoms is very striking: a fiery thirst, a never-ending desire\r\nto make water, a parched skin, a dry mouth, and so forth. Diabetes, he\r\njustly remarks, is a species of dropsy, the water in the one case being\r\ndetermined to the peritoneum, and in the other to the urinary organs.\r\nWe have, in fact, known these diseases reciprocate. He recommends by\r\nall means attention to the thirst, endeavouring to allay it by means\r\nof the medicines called Adipsa; rectifying the stomach by purging with\r\nhiera; and applying epithemes of spikenard, mastich, and the like. For\r\ndrink he directs us to give water in which the autumnal fruits have been\r\nboiled; and for food recommends starch, milk, and cold astringent wines.\r\nHe concludes by saying that the general remedies and regimen proper\r\nin dropsical cases will answer in diabetes, and particularly mentions\r\nthe theriac and mithridate. Among the causes of diabetes he mentions\r\npoisoning by the sting of the African viper, called the _dipsas_. This\r\nsubject will be found treated of in the Fifth Book.\r\n\r\nCelsus recommends exercise, friction, purging, astringent food, and\r\naustere wine. Galen states that he only recollected having met with two\r\ncases of diabetes. He maintains that it is such an affection of the\r\nurinary organs as lientery is of the bowels. He is decidedly of opinion\r\nthat the kidneys are primarily affected, and not the stomach, as some had\r\nsupposed. He explains his views of the nature of the disease with great\r\nprecision. (De Locis Affectis, vi, 3.)\r\n\r\nAëtius has given the fullest account of diabetes. Upon the authority of\r\nArchigenes, he recommends at the commencement bleeding and diuretics,\r\nthe latter being given to clear away the vitiated urine from the\r\nkidneys; but if the disease be of long standing, he proscribes both those\r\nmeasures. He recommends also a cooling diet, ruddy wine diluted, cooling\r\napplications to the pubes and loins, and, in certain cases, narcotics,\r\nsuch as opium and mandragora.\r\n\r\nAlexander’s theory respecting the nature of the disease is the same as\r\nour author’s, both having borrowed it from Galen. He recommends food of\r\ndifficult digestion, such as the feet of oxen, the flesh of pompions,\r\nchesnuts, &c. He forbids all saltish, acrid, and diuretic articles. He\r\nsays nothing of venesection.\r\n\r\nActuarius recommends purgatives, in order to determine to the intestines,\r\nand astringent and refrigerant remedies in general.\r\n\r\nAvenzoar explains fully his views respecting the nature and treatment\r\nof diabetes, in which he follows Galen closely. But the fullest and\r\nmost accurate of the Arabian authorities on this subject is Avicenna.\r\nIn certain cases, he admits of venesection at the commencement. The\r\nremedies, however, in which he seems to place the greatest reliance, are\r\nemetics and sudorifics, which he gives until the intention of altering\r\nthe determination of the fluids to the kidneys. He particularly directs\r\nthe patient to avoid taking all diuretic articles, to use exercise on\r\nhorseback, moderate friction, and, in the decline of the disease, the\r\ntepid bath with fragrant wine.\r\n\r\nSerapion gives nearly the same account as Aëtius, only he says nothing\r\nof venesection. Haly Abbas states, with his usual precision, the theory\r\nof Galen and the other Greek authorities, namely, that the disease\r\nis occasioned by a preternatural increase of the attractive faculty\r\nof the kidneys, arising from heat of the viscus. Agreeably to this\r\ntheory of the disease, his remedies are refrigerants and astringents.\r\nAlsaharavius advocates similar views of the nature and treatment of the\r\ndisease. When the urine is thick, with some appearances of blood, he\r\nrecommends venesection. According to Rhases, the affection is connected\r\nwith preternatural heat of the kidneys and debility of their retentive\r\nfaculty. He says it resembles lientery of the intestines.\r\n\r\nTo those who are conversant with the principles of ancient physiology,\r\nthe theory advanced by Galen, and advocated by all subsequent\r\nauthorities, will appear very plausible and ingenious. The ancients\r\nappear not to have known that the urine some times possesses saccharine\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nRogerius, like the ancient authorities, refers diabetes to a hot\r\nintemperament of the kidneys, whereby their attractive faculty is\r\nincreased. (Tr. i, 54.) All the earlier writers on medicine appear to\r\nhave held the same hypothesis.\r\n\r\n_On strangury and dysuria._ As these diseases arise from a variety of\r\ncauses, our author has properly treated of them accordingly. We do not\r\nfind that the other authorities supply much additional information.\r\n\r\nHippocrates mentions that there are many varieties of strangury. His\r\nremedies are the tepid bath, diluent drinks, diuretics, and anodynes.\r\n\r\nAëtius states that the disease is called dysuria when the patient has a\r\ndesire and passes his urine with difficulty, and strangury when it is\r\npassed in drops. It is occasioned, he says, by acrimony of the urine,\r\nulceration, or debility of the bladder. It may also arise from affections\r\nof the kidneys and liver, or from an intemperament. The treatment is to\r\nbe varied accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhen dysuria is connected with weakness of the bladder Leo recommends\r\nthat pressure should be made with the hands on the hypogastric region.\r\n\r\nAvicenna is particularly full upon these affections. For _ardor urinæ_\r\nHaly Abbas recommends various emollient and cooling articles, such as\r\nmallows, the seeds of cucumbers, pompions, and the hot bath, &c. When\r\nit proceeds from an inflammatory cause, he recommends the treatment\r\ndirected in the beginning of this Section. When these remedies prove\r\nineffectual, the catheter is to be used. He says that one of the most\r\ncommon causes of the complaint is debility of the expulsive faculty of\r\nthe bladder. Alsaharavius treats fully of these complaints in much the\r\nsame terms. When dysuria is connected with inflammation, he recommends\r\nbleeding, diluent drinks, and the warm bath. When it proceeds from a clot\r\nof blood he directs us to inject into the bladder the water of ashes.\r\n(_Aqua cinerum_, perhaps it should be _aqua cicerum_.) Rhases states that\r\nthe complaint generally arises in old men from heat or ulceration at the\r\nneck of the bladder. He justly remarks that when retention arises from\r\ninflammation, no urine at all is passed, and the pain is constant; and\r\nthat, when connected with obstruction, the bladder gets distended.\r\n\r\nFor inflammation, pain, and ulceration of the bladder, Scribonius Largus\r\nrecommends water into which a heated iron had been plunged. He adds that\r\nhe had known the chalybeate waters of Tuscany do much good in diseases\r\nof the bladder. This may be said to be an anticipation of the modern\r\npractice, introduced, we believe, by the late Mr. Cline, of giving the\r\ntincture of muriated iron in such cases.\r\n\r\n_On incontinence of urine._ Galen properly remarks that incontinence of\r\nurine is often occasioned by injury of the spinal marrow either through\r\nviolence, or the application of cold. (De Loc. Affect. iv, 7.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Avicenna it is occasioned by excessive cold, by relaxation\r\nof the muscles (_sphincter vesicæ?_) or weakness of the bladder, as\r\nhappens at the end of certain diseases, or by the immoderate use of\r\ndiuretics. Rhases says briefly, that the complaint is occasioned by\r\nexcessive heat or coldness. When it proceeds from the former cause, he\r\nrecommends a composition of coriander, vinegar, Armenian bole, acorns,\r\n&c. When from cold, he prescribes the following: Of dried acorns, of\r\nfrankincense, q. s. to be rubbed into the pubes with oil of ben, or\r\noil of rue. Haly Abbas attributes the complaint to enervation of the\r\nsphincter vesicæ and loss of the retentive faculty of the bladder. He\r\nalso mentions its connexion with disease of the spine. Alsaharavius\r\nrecommends various stimulant liniments externally, and galls, vinegar,\r\nand the like internally.\r\n\r\nRuffus briefly describes a disease of the urinary organs, by the name\r\nof _scabies vesicæ_, attended with furfuraceous sediments and pains in\r\nthe hypogastric regions, and ending, for the most part, in ulcerations\r\nof the bladder. The disease is said to be of a very intractable nature.\r\nIt is alluded to by Hippocrates. (Aph. iv, 77; where see the Comment.\r\nof Theophilus, ed. Dietz.) It is further stated in one of the aphorisms\r\nthat blood, pus, and scales in the urine, accompanied with deep pain,\r\nindicate ulceration of the bladder. (Ed. Dietz., t. ii, 437.) Theophilus\r\nsays, blood, pus, and scales in the urine, with a heavy smell, indicate\r\nulceration of the kidneys or bladder. (De Urinis, 15.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLVI.—ON THE AFFECTIONS OF THE LIVER.\r\n\r\nThe affections of the liver being various (for it is subject to atony,\r\ninflammation, erysipelas, scirrhus, apostemes, ulcers, and obstructions),\r\nwe shall treat first of atony of it, in which case, particularly those\r\naffected with it, are usually called hepatics. If, therefore, it evacuate\r\nthe excrements in a state of chyle, but more liquid than natural,\r\nthe distribution of the food to the liver being either diminished or\r\naltogether stopped, while the stomach is unaffected, it is to be inferred\r\nthat the attractive power of the liver is in a weak state. But if they\r\nresemble the washings of newly-killed flesh, it is the alterative, and,\r\nas it has been called, the sanguificative power that is affected. But if\r\nthe atony arise from a hot intemperament, in process of time it appears\r\nmore feculent and very fetid, the bile being high-coloured and thick.\r\nWherefore, the substance of the liver being already melted, the whole\r\nbody also is melted down; and there is fever, anorexia, and vomiting of\r\nbile. When the intemperament is cold, the discharges are neither constant\r\nnor many, for the affection is a chronic one; and for several days the\r\ndischarges from the belly will be more abundant, but less fetid, like\r\nthe lees of thick blood, approaching to black bile. And many and various\r\ncolours indicate a cold intemperament; for the fever is obscure, the face\r\nnot collapsed, and there is rather a desire of food. Whichever of these\r\nintemperaments prevails, if complicated with the dry, the excrements\r\nappear drier and fewer in number, and there is more thirst; but, if the\r\nhumid, they are more liquid and abundant, and the patients have less\r\nthirst. When the liver is inflamed, there is, in all cases, pain in\r\nthe right hypochondrium, extending upwards as far as the clavicle, but\r\ndownwards as far as the false ribs; an acute fever, dry cough, thirst,\r\nloathing of food, and difficulty of breathing; the tongue at first\r\nappears red, but afterwards black; there is vomiting of bile, and the\r\nbelly is constipated. These symptoms being like to those of pleurisy, we\r\nhave stated the difference under the head of pleurisy. When erysipelas is\r\nseated in the liver, the inflammatory heat is intense, there is ardent\r\nfever, and marasmus supervenes. In particular, when the concave parts\r\nof the liver are inflamed, there is nausea and vomitings, anorexia,\r\nintense inflammatory heat, deliquium animi; and the parts often\r\nbecome congealed, so that dropsical effusions derive their origin from\r\nhence. When the convex parts are inflamed, the other symptoms just now\r\nenumerated are present, with a visible swelling along its circumference,\r\nwhich swelling is manifest both to the sight and the touch. These are\r\nthe symptoms of a strong and great inflammation; but if it is weak, we\r\nmust order the patient to take in a large inspiration, and, if he says\r\nthat he has pain in the right hypochondrium, we may conclude that there\r\nis moderate inflammation of the liver. But if an oblong tumour of a\r\nphlegmonous nature appear in the position of the muscles which lie over\r\nit, and none of the aforesaid symptoms be present, we know that the\r\nmuscles themselves are inflamed. Weight with distension, and a sensation\r\nof pain in the right hypochondrium, without swelling or fever, indicate\r\nan obstruction of the veins, at the place where those of the porta and\r\nconcave parts of the liver join those of its convex parts. When the\r\ninflammation is converted into an abscess, the pain and distension\r\nincrease, inordinate rigors come on, and they cannot lie on the left side\r\nwithout increasing the pain in the liver. When the abscess bursts, the\r\nmatter is discharged freely by the urine or bowels. If the tumour pass\r\ninto a scirrhous state, the pain is diminished, but there is a manifest\r\nswelling, attended with hardness, and the surrounding parts become\r\nemaciated. But, in process of time, the diagnosis becomes difficult; for\r\ndropsy supervenes, and the whole hypochondrium is concealed by the water.\r\nFor a hot intemperament of the Liver, we must use those things which have\r\nthe properties of moderately cooling and strengthening the viscus, such\r\nas endive and succory, sometimes eaten raw and sometimes boiled with\r\ncoriander; and the decoction and juice of them may be drunk; and not\r\nonly thus, but the plant, when sprinkled dry upon honied water, relieves\r\nhot and cold intemperaments of the liver. And the species of those herbs\r\ncalled intybus, and troximus, and the sow-thistle, are possessed of\r\nsimilar properties. And a cupful of the juice of citron added to honied\r\nwater has the same effect, and that of the brake in like manner. But if\r\nthe intemperament is moderate and complicated with obstruction, these\r\nthings may be given in some light wine, or some of the diuretics. And\r\nthe following pill may be taken: Of succory, dr. iv; of the root of\r\nground-pine, dr. iv; give in boiled honey to the size of a Pontic nut,\r\nand let the patient take some warm water, and then let him be made\r\nto drink the propomata from opium and the seed of hyoscyamus, and the\r\nantidote of Philo. In those cases in which the heat is intense, it may\r\nbe very proper to give of the oil of roses, or of apples, in a draught.\r\nFor food, let them take of the juice of ptisan, or chondrus, with\r\nhydrorosatum, and bread in like manner out of water, with some of the\r\nsweet potions; and, in a word, let them take such food as is moderately\r\ncooling without being obstruent; abstaining altogether from wine, unless\r\nthey require it for some other cause, such as atony of the stomach, and\r\nin that case the kind which is given should be thin, weak, and watery.\r\nAnd erysipelas of the liver must be cured in like manner. When the\r\nintemperament is cold, we must proceed on the opposite mode; we must give\r\nthem bread with wine, and cabbage which has been twice or three times\r\nboiled. Let them taste lightly of chesnuts, take what is sufficient of\r\ngrapes, and of the flesh of fowls, and drink wine. Let them get a propoma\r\nfrom eupatorium, asarabacca, or the medicine from pepper; and a selection\r\nmust be made for them from among the remedies formerly mentioned for\r\ncolic and dysentery. The medicines called cyphoid do not suit entirely\r\nwith the hot intemperaments, unless the heat be small and joined to\r\nmuch humidity; but they are excellent remedies for the cold, and more\r\nespecially if complicated with humidity or obstruction of the liver.\r\nWhen the obstruction is occasioned by thick and viscid humours, we may\r\ngive the myacantha (_wild asparagus?_), more especially the fruit of it,\r\nand the rind of the root of bay, agrimony in oxymel, or in the decoction\r\nof bitter lupines, with rue and pepper. And the flour of lupines in a\r\ndraught; and of roots of cappers, p. ij; of costus, p. j, with wine; and\r\nthe medicine from cacanus, are of use for obstructions occasioned by\r\nthick and viscid humours; also the iris, the fruit and rind of pistaches,\r\nhorehound, and bitter almonds, and the trochisks from them, the root of\r\ndracunculus, and wakerobin, agaric, vinegar of squills, and oxymel. And\r\nthe dried liver of a wolf, powdered and given with sweet wine to the\r\namount of a spoonful, is applicable for all affections of the liver. And\r\nthe antidote Theodoretus is one of the best remedies for obstructions\r\nof the liver, scirrhus, chronic inflammation, colics, and jaundice; and\r\nin like manner the picra with oxymel. The food which is given should\r\nbe of a heating and deobstruent nature, such as leeks in oxymel, marsh\r\nasparagus, and capers in like manner; and the other articles of food\r\nshould be boiled with some of the calefacient and deobstruent condiments.\r\nThey should drink light old wine, avoiding such as are thicker, and\r\nalso frequent baths, more especially after food. If the affection be\r\nprotracted, we may have recourse to venesection and purging, if nothing\r\nprevent. When the liver is inflamed, we must bleed from the right arm\r\nwithout delay, and take away a great quantity, if the strength permit.\r\nAnd over the viscus we must apply externally a cataplasm made of the\r\nflour of barley, of fenugreek, and of linseed, with dates, or quinces and\r\nthe flower of melilot, wormwood, and oil of chamomile; in a word, we must\r\nmix astringents with emollients. The epithemes to be applied are that of\r\nNileus, the fragrant, the Philagrianum, that of Apollophanes, that made\r\nof melilots, and the one called Copton. For great inflammations, the\r\nfollowing one is of tried efficacy: Of the flowers of wormwood, of Celtic\r\nnard, of asarabacca, of saffron, of each, oz. j; of iris, of myrrh, of\r\nstorax, of bdellium, of ammoniac perfume, of each, oz. ij; of a calf’s\r\nmarrow, oz. iv; of cerate of lentisk, lb. iv. Oxymel is also to be given\r\nto them, and the simple remedies, such as asarabacca, Celtic or Indian\r\nnard, bog-rush, and Macedonian parsley. We must stimulate the bowels by\r\nnettle, or the herb mercury eaten boiled; and during the decline of the\r\ncomplaint we must give of dodder of thyme (_epithymum_), and of polypody\r\nin honied water; and evacuate the bowels with a clyster, in the beginning\r\nby means of honied water with salts or nitre, but in the decline mix with\r\nhyssop, marjoram, or bastard saffron, or centaury and colocynth. In a\r\nword, the concave parts of the liver are to be purged by the belly, and\r\nthe convex by the urine. For food, give them the juice of ptisan in which\r\nparsley has been boiled. We have already stated the cure of erysipelatous\r\ninflammation. When an aposteme is formed, we must promote its rupture, by\r\napplying a cataplasm of the composition called trispermus, with rosin,\r\nmanna, pitch, the roots of marshmallows, pigeon’s dung, and goat’s dung.\r\nBut let them take the propoma from the decoction of poley, that of the\r\nfumitory which grows in hedges, reduced to a third part, the decoction of\r\ntreacle-mustard or of succory, and of the root of wall-germander. When\r\nthe rupture takes place, honied water and the other things mentioned for\r\nulcerated kidneys may be given; and externally the plaster of Mnasæus,\r\nand the other emollient plasters, and the Icesian, or that from willows\r\nmay be applied. When the liver is in a scirrhous state, there is little\r\nhope of recovery, as the affection will pass into dropsy; and yet it may\r\nbe attempted by mixing ammoniac, bdellium, marrow, grease, and things of\r\nsimilar properties, with emollients. The patients may take draughts of\r\nsuch things as will act as deobstruents and detergents of the viscus,\r\nsuch as diuretics and lithontriptics, along with those just now mentioned\r\nfor obstruction of the liver; the diet being regulated accordingly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Consult Hippocrates (de Intern. Affect. 30); Galen (Meth.\r\nMed. xiii; Sec. Loc. vii); Aretæus (Morb. Acut. ii, 7; Morb. Chron. i,\r\n13); Celsus (iv. 8); Alexander (vii, 19); Aëtius (x, i); Oribasius (Loc.\r\nAffec. iv, 96); Nonnus (182); Cælius Aurelianus (Pass. Tard. iii, 4);\r\nOctavius Horatianus (ii, 13); Marcellus (de Med. 22); Scribonius Largus\r\n(30); Avicenna (iii, 14, 1); Avenzoar (i, 13); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix,\r\n30; Pract. vii, 31); Alsaharavius (Pract. xviii); Serapion (iv); Rhases\r\n(Divis. 62; ad Mansor. ix, 67; Contin. xvi.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates describes three varieties of hepatic disease, which appear\r\nto have been bilious fevers. It is not easy to define the principles\r\nupon which his practice is directed. He mentions, however, emollient\r\napplications, bleeding, purging, and vomiting; and, when the disease is\r\nprotracted, recommends the side to be burned with spindles of box-wood\r\nsmeared with oil. He directs abscesses of the liver to be opened by the\r\ncautery. (Coac. 457.) He states that abscesses of the liver are least\r\ndangerous when they open externally; more so when they open internally;\r\nand most of all when they open both internally and externally. (Prognost.\r\n7.) He makes mention of hydatids, and says of them that when they burst\r\ninto the cavity of the peritoneum, the case proves fatal. (vii, 54; where\r\nsee the Comment. of Theophilus and Damascius, ed. Dietz, p. 540.)\r\n\r\nGalen has laid down the principles upon which inflammation of the liver\r\nshould be treated in the 13th book of his ‘Methodus Medendi.’ We can\r\nonly afford room for his conclusions. He approves of venesection with\r\nthe intention of producing revulsion. Such articles of food and medicine\r\nare to be given as will emulge the biliary ducts without occasioning\r\nirritation, and everything of the opposite kind is to be abstained from.\r\nWherefore such things as are sweet and viscid are to be avoided, and only\r\nsuch as are detergent without pungency are to be allowed. Of this class\r\nare ptisan and oxymel much diluted. Astringents, such as pomegranates,\r\nare improper, because they occasion contraction of the vessels; and they\r\nare more especially to be avoided when the concave side of the liver is\r\naffected. When the convex is affected, these articles, being altered by\r\nthe action of the liver before they reach the seat of the disease, prove\r\nless prejudicial. When the concave side is the seat of the disease,\r\nhe directs us to evacuate by the bowels, which may be accomplished by\r\nmixing with the food cnicus (carthamus tinctorius?) the herb mercury,\r\n&c.; but, if stronger medicines are required, black hellebore, colocynth,\r\nthe small centaury, and the like, may be given. When the convex side is\r\naffected, he directs us to give diuretics; at first parsley, but, after\r\nthe inflammation has subsided, the stronger ones, such as Celtic nard,\r\nvalerian, spignel, &c. He animadverts in strong terms upon the practice\r\nof the _Thessalian Asses_, so he calls the Methodists.\r\n\r\nWe regret that our limits prevent us from doing justice to the views\r\nof Aretæus. The liver, he states, is the grand seat of sanguification,\r\nbeing itself but a concretion of blood. Hence, he says, diseases of it\r\nprove speedily fatal. He accounts for the pain which is felt at the top\r\nof the shoulder or clavicle in this way: the liver, being enlarged and\r\nbecoming heavier than natural, drags down the diaphragm to which it is\r\nattached, and thus stretches also the pleura from its upper adhesions,\r\nwhereby pain in the part is produced. A crisis, he says, may take place\r\nby a hemorrhage, a copious discharge of bile, or of urine; or the disease\r\nmay terminate in suppuration, or in dropsy. When pus is formed, it may be\r\ndischarged by urine, by the bowels, or it may point outwardly. In this\r\nlast case, he recommends us to open it with an instrument red hot. When\r\nit does not suppurate it is apt to end in scirrhus, which is marked by\r\na dull pain in the part. His treatment of acute hepatitis consists of\r\nvenesection, refrigerant and discutient applications externally, cupping\r\nor leeching the side affected, then applying cerates and emollient\r\nointments, consisting of attenuants and diuretics, such as wormwood,\r\ncider, &c. The food is to be light, of easy distribution, and diuretic.\r\nHis treatment of chronic disease is varied, according as the matter\r\npasses by the urine or the bowels; but the chapter on it is incomplete.\r\n\r\nCelsus at the commencement recommends bleeding, purging even with black\r\nhellebore, cataplasms at first repellent and then calefacient. Diuretics\r\nare to be given, such as thyme, hyssop, &c.; and all cold things are to\r\nbe avoided. When a vomica forms, it is to be opened and burnt.\r\n\r\nAlexander’s account is full and judicious. He says that, in cases of\r\nobstruction of the liver, when deobstruents are given before the swelling\r\nis softened, the juices being overheated become _like stones_ and cannot\r\nbe discussed. He alludes, of course, to hepatic calculi, or gall-stones.\r\nHe gives copious directions for emollient ointments to be rubbed into the\r\nside to dispel the enlargement of the liver.\r\n\r\nIn treating of scirrhus, Aëtius recommends the emollient ointments,\r\ncupping, leeching, calefacient plasters, sinapisms, burning by medicines\r\nor by the actual cautery.\r\n\r\nThe account given by Actuarius is in so far important, as it shows that\r\nthe views of practice had not changed in his days. In inflammation, he\r\nrecommends to bleed two or three times, and to unite emollients with\r\ndeobstruents in the external applications.\r\n\r\nFor a full exposition of the doctrines of the Methodists, we must\r\nrefer to Cælius Aurelianus, of whose opinions we can afford room only\r\nfor a very brief outline. The symptoms of scirrhus of the liver, as\r\nstated by him, are a round circumscribed tumour felt below the ribs,\r\nthe colour jaundiced, the urine muddy, pain extending to the throat\r\nof the affected side, difficulty of lying on the left side, as this\r\nposture suspends the enlarged viscus. (By the way, Cassius assigns the\r\nsame reason why persons labouring under disease of the liver or spleen\r\nlie easiest on the affected side. Probl. vi.) At the commencement he\r\nrecommends fomentations, cataplasms, laxative food, and then cupping,\r\nscarifications, and leeching. When the attack is violent, venesection is\r\nto be premised. Frequent changes, acrid food, and emetics with vinegar\r\nof squills or hellebore are also mentioned. He recommends a sea-voyage,\r\nvapour-baths, hot springs, the sand-bath, and various stimulant and\r\nrubefacient applications to the side. He delivers his strictures very\r\nfreely upon the practice of the other sects. Thus he justly condemns\r\nas too bold and dangerous a measure the proposal of Erasistratus to lay\r\nbare the liver, and apply the remedies direct to the part affected. He\r\nthinks Asclepiades improperly rejected gestation, baths, cataplasms, and\r\nemollient ointments. He also condemns the free use of cauteries to the\r\naffected side.\r\n\r\nSerapion, like Alexander, states strongly the danger of using discutients\r\nbefore emollients, lest the juices become indurated. No ancient author\r\nhas treated of the diseases of the liver so fully as Avicenna. He is most\r\nminute in his distinctions of disease, and particular in his application\r\nof remedies. Among other diseased states of the viscus, he mentions\r\ndiminution of bulk. Had not _inspectiones cadaverum_ been common in\r\nancient times, the existence of this state of diseased structure could\r\nnot have been ascertained. In abscess, he and Serapion make mention\r\nof taraxacum or the dandelion, which was recommended by the late Dr.\r\nPemberton in cases of diseased liver, and is still used occasionally.\r\nHaly Abbas directs us, when suppuration takes place, to determine to the\r\nkidneys by diuretics; and, when the abscess bursts into the cavity of\r\nthe peritoneum, he advises us to open it. When it makes its way to the\r\nstomach or bowels, he recommends us to promote its discharge by purging.\r\nHe remarks that sometimes an abscess will form externally to the liver\r\nand put on the appearance of hepatic abscess. He directs it to be opened\r\nwith aperient medicines or the lancet. He takes notice of the pain at the\r\ntop of the shoulder, which, like Aretæus, he attributes to the dragging\r\ndown of the parts by the heavy liver. In the cold aposteme (chronic\r\ninflammation?) he recommends wormwood, fenugreek, hyssop, spikenard,\r\nfennel, and the like. One of his favourite remedies for hepatic disease\r\nis rhubarb. Alsaharavius gives a long account of these diseases.\r\nInflammation he treats by bleeding, various laxative and cooling\r\nmedicines, emollient plasters, &c. In obstruction he gives rhubarb,\r\nwormwood, fennel, endive, &c.; and bleeds, if there be a sanguineous\r\nplethora. He treats fully of a discharge of blood from the liver. When it\r\narises from the bursting of a vein after excessive fatigue, he directs\r\nus to bleed; but when it proceeds from relaxation and debility, he\r\nrecommends astringents externally and internally. The account of hepatic\r\ndiseases given by Rhases in his ‘Continens’ is particularly excellent,\r\nbut it is too lengthy for our limits. He explains the pain at the top\r\nof the shoulder in the same way as Aretæus. He mentions that gross food\r\nproduces enlargement of the liver, and hence animals fed on figs have\r\nlarge livers. For inflammation he recommends at first depletion and\r\nafterwards refrigerants, such as camphor, fleawort, and even snow-water.\r\nHe recommends aloes with wormwood as a deobstruent cathartic.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLVII.—ON CACHEXIA.\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed to call the commencement of dropsical affections\r\ncachexia. Wherefore we must cure it by bleeding, if nothing prevent, at\r\nintervals, and continuing the abstraction until the third or fourth day.\r\nBut, in an especial manner, we must evacuate those who have fallen into\r\nthis affection from retention of the hemorrhoidal or menstrual discharge;\r\nas in those cases which arise from a copious evacuation, we must abstain\r\nfrom venesection, and by all means purge with the hiera from colocynth.\r\nThe diet should be light and desiccative; and recourse must be had to\r\nnatural baths, namely the aluminous, and more especially the nitrous, and\r\nthen the sulphureous; but the other kind of baths may be taken at greater\r\nintervals. Let them be exercised in every way, more especially by those\r\nwho are called jatraliptæ. At last they must be put under a course of\r\nhellebore. They are wonderfully remedied by a propoma of wormwood, and\r\nby sinapisms and dropaces. If the affection is converted into dropsy, we\r\nmust have recourse to the treatment applicable for dropsical cases in the\r\nmanner about to be explained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Almost all the authors referred to in the preceding Section\r\nmay be consulted on cachexia and dropsy.\r\n\r\nAretæus gives an accurate account of this affection, which, he says,\r\nusually terminates in dropsy, phthisis, or wasting. He mentions many\r\nsymptoms of it, such as œdema, difficulty of breathing, and so forth; and\r\nhe correctly remarks that the alvine discharges are dry, white, crude,\r\nand without bile. His chapter on the treatment unfortunately is lost.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus says that Themison was the first who explained the\r\ntreatment of cachexia. He mentions as causes of the disease intemperance,\r\nthe improper use of medicines, hardness of the liver or spleen,\r\nlong-continued hemorrhoidal discharge, vomiting, protracted fevers,\r\n&c. His treatment is judiciously varied according to the cause of the\r\ndisease, and is given at great length.\r\n\r\nAëtius gives a very interesting account of the views and practice of\r\nArchigenes. He says the disease is generally occasioned by scirrhus of\r\nthe liver or spleen. Like our author, he recommends bleeding if not\r\ncontra-indicated, and purging with drastic cathartics, such as the hiera\r\nfrom colocynth, friction, rubefacients, exercise, the bath, and thin\r\nwhite wines. Celsus admits of bleeding, but not until after purging,\r\nfriction, unction, and exercise have failed to restore the health.\r\n\r\nSerapion expresses himself in much the same terms as our author and\r\nAëtius respecting venesection; but Avicenna recommends not to have\r\nrecourse to it unless there be a sanguineous plethora. He also forbids\r\nbaths of sweet water, but otherwise he adopts the treatment recommended\r\nby the Greeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLVIII.—ON DROPSY.\r\n\r\nWhen the liver is greatly congealed, sometimes primarily, as when it has\r\nbeen inflamed, indurated, or otherwise affected, or when from sympathy\r\nwith other parts, the process of sanguification ceases, and the affection\r\nis called dropsy. When a great quantity of air is collected with a small\r\nquantity of fluid between the peritoneum and intestines, so that the\r\nabdomen when struck sounds like a drum, the dropsy in this case gets the\r\nname of tympanites, being formed by flatulence about the stomach, belly,\r\nand colon, and by chronic fevers. But sometimes from hardness of the\r\nperitoneum and of the uterus in women, or from scirrhus, on the contrary,\r\na great collection of fluid with a very small proportion of air is formed\r\nin the same parts, being confined as it were in a bladder, when the\r\ndropsy is named ascites, and is occasioned by the afore-mentioned causes;\r\nbut, for the most part, it arises from hardness and scirrhus about the\r\nspleen and liver, and from chronic defluxions about the intestines;\r\nwhereby it happens that the belly is swelled, while the rest of the\r\nbody is melted owing to its not being nourished. Sometimes throughout\r\nthe whole body a colder and more pituitous blood is collected, either\r\ncoming from the liver, or deriving its origin from a melting down of\r\nthe flesh of the whole body, which is as it were converted into water,\r\nso that the whole body appears white and pituitous like a corpse, and\r\nthen the affection is called leucophlegmatia, dropsy of the flesh,\r\nor anasarca, being occasioned by protracted fevers, cachexia of the\r\nstomach, suppression of long-continued hemorrhoidal discharges, the\r\nfemale flux, dyspnœa, inordinate insomnolency, and similar causes. In\r\ntreating these complaints, we commence generally with evacuation; but\r\nin ascites and tympanites it is by administering hydrogogue medicines;\r\nand in anasarca by bloodletting, more especially when the affection is\r\nformed by retention of the hemorrhoidal or menstrual discharges, unless\r\nthe patients had been previously bled for cachexia; and in this case,\r\nas in cachexia, the evacuation must be made at intervals. Then, having\r\ncarefully triturated the dried dung of an ox of the herd, boil it in\r\noxycrate or oxymel, and sprinkling on it a fourth part of sulphur, apply\r\nit over the whole belly; or, apply a cataplasm of goat’s dung with the\r\nurine of a child, made of the thickness of bath-sordes. These things\r\npurge strongly by the belly; and we may use cataplasms made of leaven,\r\ndried figs, calcined lime, nitre, iris, cardamom, native sulphur,\r\nammoniac, bay-berries, stavesacre, the dung of wild pigeons, all or\r\nsome of these may be used with oxymel. After which the epitheme, called\r\nspongium, made of goat’s dung, evacuates the fluids in a wonderful\r\nmanner, both by the insensible pores and by the belly. Afterwards we must\r\napply desiccative plasters, that from willows, the Icesian, the barber’s,\r\nthat from bay-berries, the Polyarchium, and that from seeds. And the\r\nfollowing one is wonderfully efficacious, for it fetches, as it were,\r\nthe fluids from the deep-seated parts: Of the stone pyrites, dr. xij;\r\nof native sulphur, dr. xij; of ammoniac perfume, dr. xij; of cumin, dr.\r\nxvj; of nitre, dr. xij; add to a little wax and turpentine, and spreading\r\nit upon a piece of skin, apply to the whole belly. Let them take the\r\npropoma (liqueur) made by boiling the root of vervain-mallow in wine, or\r\nmacerate the wild cucumber in austere wine, and give every three days,\r\nadding a cupful every day, until the dose amount to three cupfuls. The\r\nfollowing is a very compound mixture: Of balsam, of nard, of cassia,\r\nof cumin, of liquorice, of St. John’s-wort, of bog-rush, of asarabacca,\r\nof carrot, of amomum, of myrrh, of Macedonian parsley, of sweet hay, of\r\npepper, of hartwort, of cow-parsnip, equal parts. Each of these produces\r\na good effect by itself, and in like manner all the diuretics. Squill\r\nbaked and triturated with honey, and given as a linctus, provokes urine\r\nwithout trouble; or it may be boiled in the water which is drunk. And\r\nthe following is an excellent remedy: Boil lb. ij of the inner part of\r\nsquills in iij sextarii of austere wine until it be reduced to one third;\r\ngive every day of this wine, beginning with a mystrum, until the dose\r\namount to an ounce. The following is an excellent diuretic: Of moist\r\nalum, the size of a bean; dissolve in water; strain through a linen\r\ncloth; and give to drink every third day, or every alternate day. Picra\r\ngiven in oxymel, the theodoret, and the trochisk from bitter almonds also\r\nsuit with them. There are many hydragogues, but the following are of\r\napproved efficacy: The seeds of the thymelæa (grana cnidia), xl or l; or\r\nlathyrides, xx or xxx; or of euphorbium, v or vj siliquæ; or of flakes of\r\ncopper, dr. ij or iij; being mixed with crumbs of bread and formed into\r\npills; or the juice of the rind of elder-root, drunk with prepared wine;\r\nor of the leaves of mezeron, of burnt copper, and of anise, equal parts;\r\ngive in water at first to the amount of dr. j; and afterwards of dr. ij,\r\nor more. And the following are admirable pills: Of aloes, of euphorbium,\r\nof grana cnidia, of each, oz. j; of rhubarb, oz. ss; mix together with\r\nthe juice of cabbage, and form into pills, and give to the amount of\r\nviij or ix siliquæ. And the antidote from cloves evacuates water in a\r\nwonderful manner. And we must try the effect of a hydragogue wine. The\r\nfollowing makes an excellent one: Of squills, oz. iij; of parsley-seed,\r\nof the rind of the root of capers, of pepper, of each, dr. iv; of peeled\r\ngrana cnidia, dr. j; of the Indian leaf, two balls; of best wine, xij\r\nheminæ; of raw honey, dr. xvj; beat together, sift, and macerate in the\r\nwine, but triturate the squill. The dose is three cyathi. After the\r\nevacuation of the water, we must use the theriac. And ox-dung dried and\r\ndrunk to the amount of a spoonful every day is of mighty use. We must\r\nuse the most stimulant clysters, unless the belly be spontaneously very\r\nloose, in which case we must rather use things for drying it up. When\r\nwomen are affected with dropsy we must use this pessary: Of anise, of\r\ncardamom, of cumin, of nitre, of birthwort, of fenugreek, of pennyroyal,\r\nof the inner part of figs, equal parts; mix together in the oil called\r\nSusinum, and apply _per vaginam_. Afterwards we may use the natural baths\r\nperseveringly, and the sand-bath, but we must abstain from the others;\r\nbut if they do ever go into a bath, let them sprinkle the body with\r\npowders from nitre, salts, mustard, lime, and the like. These things even\r\nwithout bathing are useful, when rubbed into the belly in a dry state,\r\nor with oil. In anasarca they must exercise the other parts as much as\r\npossible, and use dry friction in the sun. And a desiccative diet should\r\nbe taken. Let them, therefore, eat pickle, mustard, garlic, wild and dry\r\nfowls, asparagus, picktooth fennel, leeks, wild carrot, and the other\r\nwild pot-herbs; and the theriac salts, or those of Iamblichus may be\r\nmixed with condiments; and old light diuretic wine may be used, or if\r\nit is at hand, the wine prepared with salt water. But the patients must\r\nabstain from much drink of any kind, and from water altogether.\r\n\r\nWhen the dropsy is attended with fever, the patient must abstain from the\r\nmore heating and acrid food or remedies; but we may give them intermixed\r\nwith other things in case of urgent necessity. In tympanites, purgatives\r\nand every medicine which wastes the body must be rejected, and also the\r\nmore drastic diuretics; and we must use both externally and internally\r\nsuch things as can attenuate and dissipate the flatus; and dry-cupping\r\nmay be frequently applied over the whole belly. When those who have\r\nascites are not benefited by any of the remedies already described, we\r\nmust have recourse to paracentesis, which does not apply to any of the\r\nother varieties of dropsy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Hippocrates (de Intern. Affect. 25; de Ratione Victus in\r\nMorb. Acut.), and Galen’s Commentary on the same (Prognost.), with the\r\nCommentary of Stephanus (ed. Dietz), and almost all the authors who treat\r\nof hepatic diseases may be consulted.\r\n\r\nHippocrates gives a tolerably correct account of the causes and treatment\r\nof dropsy. The varieties of the disease described by him are dropsy from\r\nthe drinking of cold water, from disease of the liver, and from disease\r\nof the spleen. He further states that it is frequently the consequence\r\nof protracted fevers, diarrhœa, dysentery, and quartan fevers (de Aer.\r\n&c.) He mentions a species of dropsy which he calls the dry (Aph. iv,\r\n11), which has been generally referred to tympanitis. See Littré (t. iv,\r\n416.) In certain cases attended with dyspnœa he recommends venesection;\r\nand Galen in his Commentary states that these cases are, when the disease\r\nis preceded by suppression of the hemorrhoidal or menstrual discharges,\r\nor is connected with plethora. But no one, he says, ventures to bleed in\r\ntympanites or ascites. Hence Avicenna and most of the ancient authorities\r\nforbid venesection in dropsy, except under the circumstances mentioned\r\nby Galen. Galen says, indeed, in his work (de Venesect. ad Erasistrat.)\r\nthat he had sometimes cured dropsy by bleeding; but it is not to be\r\nunderstood that he approved of it as a common practice. In short, he\r\nwas no Sangrado, but had anticipated Blackall. One of his hydragogue\r\npotions is composed of cantharides. (De Reg. in Morb. Acut.) Hippocrates\r\nrecommends us to perform paracentesis thoracis in the side at the third\r\nrib from the last. He also approves of paracentesis abdominis in cases of\r\nascites; and directs us to burn the region of the liver, when that viscus\r\nis affected. He further approves of free scarifications of the testicles\r\nand thighs. He has described hydrops uteri, or hydrometra, a case which,\r\nalthough of rare occurrence, is occasionally met with. See Van Swieten\r\n(Comment. 1224); Vesalius (de Fabrica Hum. v, 9); Monro (Works), and Dr.\r\nA. T. Thomson (Paper in the Med. Chir. Trans. xiii, 1.)\r\n\r\nGalen gives a long list of external and internal remedies for dropsical\r\ncomplaints. (Sec. Loc. ix.) Ox-dung mentioned by our author was a\r\ncommon remedy in ancient times, according to Galen. Diogenes Laertius\r\nrelates that the celebrated Heraclitus died lying in a bed of it. Upon\r\nthe authority of Antonius Musa, Galen recommends a cataplasm containing\r\nelaterium, stavesacre, and hyssop. He recommends a vinous preparation of\r\nelder. Pliny particularly commends this medicine in dropsy, and most of\r\nthe ancient authorities make mention of its diuretic properties. Galen\r\nsays that the liver is affected in all cases of dropsy. (De Locis, v,\r\n6.) In like manner Stephanus, the commentator on Hippocrates, states\r\nthat in all cases of dropsy the liver is affected, either primarily or\r\nsympathetically. Hippocrates refers one species of dropsy to disease of\r\nthe parts situated in the loins, by which Galen and Stephanus agree that\r\nhe means the jejunum, mesaraic veins and kidneys. (Ed. Dietz. 139.)\r\n\r\nCelsus describes three varieties of dropsy, namely, ascites, anasarca,\r\nand tympanites. He enjoins restriction as to food and drink, and\r\nrecommends walking, friction, and sudorifics, such as heated sand and\r\nwarm baths. He gives a long list of diuretics, as iris, valerian,\r\nsaffron, cinnamon, &c. In tympanites he recommends emetics, cupping\r\nthe belly, rubbing it with rubefacients, and applying sinapisms to it,\r\nor burning eschars on it with heated irons. In anasarca he recommends\r\nscarifications at the inner part of the leg, squills in a linctus, and\r\nthe like. He approves of tapping in ascites.\r\n\r\nAretæus describes the symptoms of dropsy with great accuracy and\r\nelegance. He says it is a most unseemly disease, from which few recover,\r\nand those more by the aid of the gods than of art. He treats of the\r\nthree varieties already mentioned, and also makes mention of hydatids.\r\nHydatids, by the way, are described also by Galen (Comm. ad Aphor. vii,\r\n55), and Rhases (Cont. vii). He remarks that it is wonderful how much the\r\npatient in dropsy flatters himself with hopes of recovery, more than in\r\nmany other diseases far less dangerous. He states that there are partial\r\ndropsies, such as of the head, lungs, liver, spleen, and uterus. He\r\nmentions among the exciting causes of the disease the drinking of cold\r\nwater, flatulent food, and the insect buprestis (_meloe vesicatoria_ L.)\r\n\r\nFrom a passage in Plutarch, it would appear that certain forms of dropsy\r\nhad at one time been thought infectious. (De Serâ Num. Vind.)\r\n\r\nDioscorides and Ruffus praise elaterium as a hydragogue in dropsy. In the\r\n‘Euporista,’ baked squills and oxymel are particularly commended, with\r\nvarious cataplasms externally.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus states fully the causes of dropsy, such as cachexia,\r\nprotracted fevers, hardness of the liver, spleen, peritoneum, or uterus;\r\ndyspnœa, cæliac affection, dysentery, retention of the hemorrhoidal or\r\nmenstrual discharges, abstinence, an unseasonable draught of water,\r\nespecially of salt water, the abuse of medicines, and so forth. He\r\nmaintains, however, that the disease is the same, from whatever cause\r\nit arises. The common symptoms of all its varieties are said by him\r\nto be swelling, torpor, difficult breathing, disturbed sleep, thirst,\r\ndiminished urine, and sometimes latent fever. He informs us that\r\nErasistratus in his dissections generally found the liver indurated.\r\nHis external applications are very similar to those of our author. He\r\nparticularly commends a vinous tincture of squills as a hydragogue. He\r\napproves highly of paracentesis, and has answered all the objections\r\nwhich had been made to the operation. He mentions that Asclepiades\r\npractised scarifications at the ankles.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary cases of dropsy are well stated by Serenus Samonicus in the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n    “Corrupti jecoris vitio, vel splenis acervo,\r\n    Crescit hydrops, aut cum siccatæ febre medullæ,\r\n    Aut avidæ fauces gelidum hausere liquorem.”\r\n\r\nAmong his internal remedies he mentions broom-seeds, the wine of squills,\r\nelder, and hellebore.\r\n\r\nAlexander states that a coldness of the liver is the cause of dropsy, in\r\nconsequence of which it is no longer able to form blood, but converts\r\nthe fluids into water, phlegm, or air. Hence the distinction of dropsy\r\ninto ascites, anasarca, and tympanites. In certain cases of anasarca he\r\npermits venesection, in order to relieve the depression of the system.\r\nHe adds afterwards that, if not only the liver, but also the spleen and\r\nstomach appear hard, and especially if combined with plethora of blood,\r\nvenesection is to be had recourse to before all other remedies. But in\r\nascites and tympanites he agrees with Galen in condemning venesection,\r\nand trusts principally to purging and friction. Like our author, he\r\ncommends copper and the leaves of elder. Exercise, he says, is adapted in\r\nan especial manner to dropsical complaints, either by sea, on horseback,\r\nor in a couch. Horace, by the way, no doubt, alludes to the established\r\npractice of taking exercise for the cure of dropsy in the following\r\npassage:\r\n\r\n                            “Atqui\r\n    Si noles sanus, curres hydropicus.”\r\n\r\n                         (Epist. i, 2.)\r\n\r\nAlexander has stated correctly that the disease sometimes derives its\r\norigin from disease of the uterus, kidneys, spleen, liver, colon, heart,\r\nor other organ of the body. He remarks that dropsy is apt to come on in\r\nphthisical cases.\r\n\r\nOur author has merely condensed the account given by Aëtius. His list\r\nof diuretics contains squills, spikenard, alum, spurge, burnt copper,\r\n&c. Like Hippocrates, he approves highly of scarifications at the inner\r\nankle. Upon the authority of Antyllus, he recommends lying in heated\r\nsalt. In like manner, Galen and some of the other authorities speak\r\nfavorably of insolation while the patient lies on sand, wheat, or the\r\nlike. The _sand-bath_ is mentioned as a remedy for dropsy by the earlier\r\nmodern writers on medicine. See Theodoricus (iii, 33).\r\n\r\nLeo, like preceding authorities, refers all dropsies to a coldness of\r\nthe liver, and says they are mostly incurable. We do not find that\r\nAvicenna, Rhases, Avenzoar, and Serapion make any material alteration\r\non the practice of the Greeks. In certain cases of anasarca they permit\r\nvenesection, but generally condemn it in ascites. They praise mezereon or\r\nthe chamelæa strongly as a diuretic; and also make mention of colocynth\r\nand scammony. Haly Abbas treats separately of anasarca, ascites,\r\ntympanites, and dropsy from a hot cause. When anasarca is connected\r\nwith an obstructed secretion, he approves of bleeding; and, in general,\r\nrecommends abstinence from drink, exercise in the sun, friction with\r\nsand or hard towels, sulphureous baths and diuretics. He concludes with\r\nan advice not to persevere too long in the use of any one medicine. In\r\nthe treatment of ascites, he recommends mezereon, colocynth, &c., but\r\ndisapproves in general of paracentesis. For tympanitis he prescribes\r\nvarious carminatives, such as parsley, fennel, spikenard, mastich,\r\nsouthernwood, melilot, &c. Alsaharavius expresses himself strongly\r\nin favour of venesection for anasarca; and for all kinds of dropsy\r\nrecommends the sand-bath, sudorifics, and the common remedies mentioned\r\nabove. The general causes of dropsy upon which Rhases most insists are\r\ninduration of the liver and debility of the kidneys, so that they no\r\nlonger attract the aqueous superfluity of the blood. He approves of\r\nparacentesis and scarifications of the feet and testicles when they\r\nare much swelled. Among his hydragogues, the most powerful are white\r\nhellebore, elaterium, scammony, and euphorbium. He mentions that he\r\nhad known several dropsical cases cured by a spontaneous diarrhœa, and\r\nhence he recommends us not to stop one when it comes on. When dropsy is\r\nconnected with the retention of a natural evacuation, he approves of\r\nbleeding. He speaks favorably of the elder as a diuretic.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLIX.—ON THE SPLEEN.\r\n\r\nThe use of the spleen being to attract from the liver the melancholic\r\nhumour, which is, as it were, the lees of the blood, if its attractive\r\npower be weakened, or the passage obstructed by which this was formerly\r\nattracted, the black jaundice is formed, blood in an unpurified state\r\nbeing distributed over the whole body; and if there be weight and\r\ndistension about the spleen, or if there be also pain, obstruction\r\nis indicated; but if there be none of these, it is weakness of the\r\nattractive power. But vomiting of black bile taking place without fever,\r\nor any other symptom of malignity, indicates a weakness of the retentive\r\nfaculty of the spleen. A weakness of the expulsive faculty will bring\r\non anorexia, the melancholic superfluity being no longer carried to the\r\norifice of the stomach and exciting the appetite. When the melancholic\r\nhumour is infarcted in the spleen, in the first place inflammation of it\r\noccurs, indicated by heat, pain, and tightness, but afterwards it passes\r\ninto scirrhus, the heat and pain having ceased, while the swelling and\r\nhardness remain. Persons thus affected have fetor of the mouth, their\r\ngums are corroded, and ulcers in their legs are difficult to heal.\r\nWhen the liver sympathises, dropsy takes place, as formerly mentioned;\r\nwherefore intemperaments of it are to be cured like those of the liver.\r\nBut when inflammation is present, we must bleed from the left arm at the\r\nelbow, or at the extremity of the hand, in order that revulsion may take\r\nplace from as great a distance as possible, and also because of some\r\nnatural alliance between these parts. Then we are to apply a cataplasm\r\nof attenuants which are not manifestly caleficient, intermixing some of\r\nthe astringents with them. Such is that natural substance called the\r\nflower of salt. And this is an admirable cataplasm: Of fenugreek, oz. iv;\r\nof barley-flour, of cresses, of each, oz. j; of fat figs, lb. j; of the\r\nherb vervain dried, oz. j; macerate the figs in the most acrid vinegar,\r\nand boil with the other things already bruised together, and then boil\r\nagain; or apply goat’s dung boiled with raw barley-meal in oxycrate;\r\nand, if you choose, it may receive also some flower of salt. But having\r\nfirst used a fomentation of oil of privet with a little vinegar, use the\r\nemollient ointments; and first the more simple, such as this: Of wax,\r\nlb. iss; of the fat of bulls, lb. j; of nitre, oz. iij; of turpentine,\r\nof the fruit of the chaste-tree, of the bark of the root of capers, of\r\neach, oz. v; having boiled the soluble ingredients, sprinkle the powders\r\nabove. And the malagma of Nileus is an excellent one. If the inflammation\r\nis converted into scirrhus, we must use the most powerful applications so\r\nas to stimulate the skin, such as the one from goats’ dung, and that from\r\ncitrons, also that of Macherion, the barber’s, the one from bay-berries,\r\nand that from willows. This one I have found to answer upon trial: Of\r\narsenic, oz. ij; of sandarach, oz. ij; of wax, of turpentine, of each,\r\nlib. j; of dry pitch, lb. j; of galbanum, oz. j; of opopanax, oz. j; of\r\nthe bark of the root of capers, of nut ben, of each, oz. iv; of ammoniac\r\nperfume, scr. vj; of the oil of nard, and of privet, oz. v. And ammoniac,\r\nwhen rubbed over the spleen with vinegar, is often of great use, and\r\nalso, when drunk to the amount of three or four scr. with one scr. of\r\ncastor, while sitting in the hip-bath, having previously chewed dried\r\nfigs and spit them out. Or of ammoniac, p. j; of castor, p. j; give one\r\ndrachm of these things, and it will be of great service for scirrhus;\r\nand, in like manner, the bark of capers, triturated with vinegar and\r\napplied. The same, when drunk with vinegar or oxymel, evacuates thick and\r\nviscid humours, and sometimes blood. And the bark of the willow is rubbed\r\nin similarly. And the ashes of the brazier’s shop, when applied with raw\r\nbarley-meal in oxymel, is of use; and the juice of centaury, when applied\r\nexternally, and when taken in a draught; and the decoction of bitter\r\nlupines, when drunk with rue and pepper; and its flour, when applied as a\r\npoultice; and the water in which heated iron has been often extinguished,\r\nwhen given to the amount of three cyathi to such as have fever; and to\r\nsuch as are free from fever, to the amount of one cyathus with wine and\r\nvinegar; or the root of the wild dock with squills, to the amount of\r\nthree oboli; or of wall germander, and of wild thyme, an acetabulum; all\r\nthese may be given with oxymel; or, give two oboli of the juice of the\r\npimpernel having a blue flower (_anagallis cærulea?_) with oxycrate; or\r\nvinegar of squills, or oxymel. These are compound medicines: Of the root\r\nof panacea, of ammoniac perfume, of the rind of the root of capers, of\r\nfuller’s herb, of the inner part of baked squills, equal parts; give one\r\ndrachm. It is also of use in asthmatic and dropsical cases.—_Another_: Of\r\nthe fruit of tamarisk, dr. iv; of pepper, dr. iv; of spikenard, dr. ij;\r\nof ammoniac perfume, dr. ij; triturate with vinegar of squills, and give\r\none drachm in oxymel.\r\n\r\n_For scirrhus of the spleen._ Of sow-bread, dr. xx; of bryony, dr. iij;\r\nof dittany, dr. ij; of baked squills, dr. viij; of fuller’s herb, dr. vj;\r\nof the root of capers, dr. vj. Give a trochisk to the amount of three\r\noboli in oxymel. And the trochisk from heath is also applicable. The\r\nfood should be attenuant, acrid, and dry; little drink should be taken;\r\nbut exercise, friction, and sinapisms should be had recourse to, and\r\nsometimes cupping with scarifications.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates describes several diseases of the spleen in\r\nhis work, ‘de Internis Affectionibus.’ He states that in scirrhus the\r\nspleen is sometimes larger and sometimes smaller than natural. It is an\r\naffection which continues long, but is not fatal. Sometimes, he says,\r\nit terminates in dropsy, and sometimes in suppuration, when he approves\r\nof burning the side. He also recommends diuretics and purging with\r\nhellebore. The description which he gives of the symptoms of enlarged\r\nspleen, in his work ‘On Airs, &c.,’ is very curious. Dr. Coray considers\r\nthat it applies to scurvy. (See Notes, &c. 29.)\r\n\r\nAretæus remarks correctly that the spleen is very subject to scirrhus,\r\nbut little so to suppuration. Scirrhus, he says, is removed with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nFor scirrhous enlargement of the spleen, Celsus recommends unction,\r\nfriction, and sudorifics. He forbids all sweet things, milk and cheese.\r\nHe approves of pickled and salted things, acids, the vinegar of squills,\r\na decoction of wormwood, and water in which a red-hot iron has been\r\nextinguished. Emollient ointments are to be applied externally.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus says that some had directed the spleen to be cut out\r\nwhen it is much diseased, but he holds the proposal as mere words of\r\ncourse, and believes that the operation had never been performed.\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus recommends as general remedies for complaints of\r\nthe spleen, bleeding, purging, and fomentations with wool soaked in\r\nequal parts of oil and vinegar. When it becomes indurated he approves of\r\nvinegar of squills, friction, gestation, dropaces, salt baths, &c.\r\n\r\nMost of our author’s remedies are taken from Galen, who treats fully\r\nand scientifically of diseases of the spleen. He states, as a general\r\nprinciple of treatment, that the proper medicines in cases of indurated\r\nspleen are such as are of an incisive and attenuant nature. He,\r\ntherefore, approves of the mixture of bitter with austere things.\r\n\r\nAlexander forbids strong purging in the beginning of an inflammation\r\neither of the liver or spleen.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians treat of these affections similarly to the Greeks. Haly\r\nAbbas remarks that the spleen can bear much stronger medicines than the\r\nliver, and recommends in the indolent diseases of it various bitter and\r\nvery acid medicines. In inflammation he very properly bleeds. These are\r\nhis general principles of treatment, the detail of which he explains at\r\ngreat length. Avicenna and Alsaharavius treat of these diseases more\r\nminutely than any other of the ancient authorities. Rhases recommends\r\ncamel’s milk in cases of indurated spleen. He joins Archigenes in\r\ndirecting the application of sinapisms and leeches to the side.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. L.—ON JAUNDICE.\r\n\r\nJaundice is a diffusion of bile over the whole body, sometimes of black,\r\nas we stated when treating of diseases of the spleen, and sometimes\r\nof yellow. There are many varieties of this complaint, the causes and\r\ndiagnosis of which are as follows: If jaundice occurring suddenly in a\r\nfebrile complaint diminish the fever, it is critical, being occasioned by\r\na metastasis of the matter from the deep-seated parts, and, therefore,\r\nstands in no need of medicines, but is soon removed by baths and\r\nfriction. But if it is attended with fever and bilious evacuations from\r\nthe bowels, and if there be a sense of weight in the right hypochondrium,\r\na hot inflammation of the liver is indicated, by which the blood, being\r\nrendered bilious, is conveyed over the whole body. When there is heat\r\nin the part without a sense of weight, the affection is occasioned by a\r\nhot intemperament alone of the liver. If it is without fever, and the\r\nalvine discharges are white, an affection of the gall-bladder, or of its\r\nducts, is indicated. When there is a sense of heaviness in the right\r\nhypochondrium, it indicates that the ducts are obstructed; but when\r\nwithout heaviness, weakness of some of its powers is indicated, either\r\nof the attractive, by which it attracts the bile from the liver, or of\r\nthe expulsive, by which it propels the bile to the intestines. For when\r\nthe blood is not purged of bile, it is diffused over the whole body (as\r\nwe stated respecting the black jaundice); in which case the urine is\r\nvoided very much mixed with bile. But jaundice is also occasioned by a\r\nhot intemperament of the solid parts, which convert into bile whatever\r\nis brought to them in place of food, in like manner as in anasarcous\r\ncomplaints a conversion to a pituitous fluid takes place. This variety\r\nof jaundice is recognized by its not occurring at once but by degrees,\r\nnone of the afore-mentioned symptoms being present. Moreover jaundice\r\nis occasioned also by drinking certain deleterious medicines, and by\r\nthe external application of poison from some venomous animal. The cure\r\nof a hot intemperament of the liver, and of inflammation of it, and\r\nof weakness of its powers, we have treated of under the head of the\r\naffections of it; and what we said there is to be applied here without\r\nalteration, that we may not be obliged to repeat the same thing. When\r\nboth the ducts of the gall-bladder are obstructed, or either of them\r\nonly, we must let blood from the right arm. But some, both in this case\r\nand in jaundice from inflammation of the liver, open the vessel near\r\nthe middle finger of the right hand. And we must use anti-inflammatory\r\ncataplasms, and purge with hiera. But persons affected with jaundice must\r\ntake the propomata from a decoction of parsley, maiden-hair, or dock,\r\nor of wild thyme, reduced to a third part; or sprinkle wormwood on the\r\npotion. Two cyathi of the juice of radish, drunk with a cyathus of wine,\r\nis also of great use; also two or three cyathi of succory alone, and with\r\nwine. In cases of jaundice from inflammation of the liver, give a draught\r\nof mulse, or of a decoction of slender birthwort, or of St. John’s wort,\r\nor of maiden-hair, or of fuller’s herb, or of madder, in like manner;\r\nor a drachm of the shavings of hartshorn with wine, or the decoction of\r\ncarrot boiled in wine to one third; or they may take a drachm of native\r\nsulphur in eggs. These things are of great use also in obstruction.\r\nBut viij scruples of the seed of orache, with Chrysattic, or any other\r\nmust, if drunk when in the bath, effect a proper evacuation. But the\r\npicra may be properly given in powder, or with oxymel, and the one\r\ncalled Theodoret; likewise the trochisk from bitter almonds. Give also\r\nof cinnamon what can be lifted with three fingers in a cyathus of mulse,\r\nor in mixed water; or of myrrh, the bulk of a bean, with twenty seeds of\r\npepper, and the same quantity of cinnamon. Those affected with jaundice,\r\nowing to a warm intemperament of the solid parts, are to be treated with\r\ngentle friction, moderate exercise, unction and baths, with a moistening\r\nand moderately cooling diet, the juice of ptisan, intybus, endive,\r\nsuccory, fish, and light watery wine. The treatment of those who are\r\naffected with jaundice from drinking some deleterious substance, or from\r\nthe bite of some venomous animal, will be laid down in the Fifth Book.\r\nWhen bile is lodged in the vessels of the face and eyes, inject elaterium\r\nto the size of a vetch, with a woman’s milk, into the nose while in the\r\nbath, and then direct the person to descend immediately into it, but not\r\nto immerse his head; and after the bath, having given him a recruiting\r\ndiet, again inject the errhine in the sun. The juices of sow-bread, of\r\nhorehound, and of gith act in like manner. But let him draw into his\r\nnostrils, while seated in the bath, some acrid vinegar, and compress his\r\nnostrils for a short time, and it will produce a wonderful discharge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Hippocrates (de Locis in Homine, 40); Galen (de Med.\r\nsec. loc. ix); Aretæus (Morb. Chron. i, 15); Celsus (iii, 24); Cælius\r\nAurelianus (Tard. Pass. iii, 5); Aëtius (x, 18); Oribasius (Cur. Loc.\r\nAffect. iv, 99); Actuarius (Meth. Med. i, 11); Nonnus (188); Pliny (H. N.\r\nxi, 37; xxvi, 76; xxviii, 64); Ruffus Ephesius (ii); Palladius (de Feb.\r\n6); Alexander Aphrodisiensis (Probl. i, 90); Octavius Horatianus (ii,\r\n14); Scribonius Largus (31); Marcellus (de Med. 22); Serapion (iv, 9);\r\nAvicenna (iii, 15, 1); Avenzoar (i, 14, 6); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix, 33;\r\nand Pract. vii, 41); Alsaharavius (Pract. xviii, 11); Rhases (Divis. i,\r\n64; Contin. xvi.)\r\n\r\nWith regard to the etymology of the term icterus: in the first place,\r\nAretæus derives it from the animal ictis, which the Scholiast on Nicander\r\npronounces to be a wild ferret. On the identity of the _mustela_ and\r\n_ictis_, see further Pliny (H. N. xxix, 16.) Schneider determines it to\r\nbe the _mustela furo_. (Ad Aristot. H. A. vi, 30.) Isodorus would seem\r\nto agree with Aretæus, in his derivation of the term _Orig_. Suidas,\r\nhowever, derives the word from ἰκτῖνος, a species of kite, and Pliny from\r\nsome unknown bird of the imaginary name of _icterus_ (H. N. xxx, 11.) We\r\nhave no hesitation in saying that we are disposed to follow the authority\r\nof Aretæus.\r\n\r\nHippocrates directs us to give at first fatty things, and to use the\r\nbath for three days; then to abstain from these things, and purge both\r\nthe belly and the head, and give diuretics. But he forbids cholagogues,\r\nwhich, he says, only increase the disorder of the system. We have stated\r\nin the Second Book, Sect. IV, his views regarding jaundice occurring in\r\nfever. His commentator Theophilus explains that jaundice arises from\r\nobstruction of the ductus choledochus. Hippocrates lays it down as a rule\r\nthat in cases of jaundice it is a bad symptom when the liver is hard.\r\n(Aphor. vi, 42.)\r\n\r\nOur author follows closely the views of Galen. He remarks that, when in\r\nfever the bile is suddenly determined to the skin, it proves critical,\r\nand is easily removed by baths of sweet water, and friction with a\r\ndiscutient or rarefying oil. When the disease proceeds from obstruction\r\nof the vessels of the liver, he directs the administration of hot\r\nand detergent things, such as gentian, birthwort, and centaury. When\r\noccasioned by inflammation of the liver, the remedies suitable to that\r\ndisease will be proper. When inflammation and obstruction are combined\r\ntogether, they are to be removed by relaxants and detergents. He gives\r\nfrom Andromachus and Archigenes a long list of compositions for jaundice;\r\nbut we must be content with explaining his general principles without\r\nentering upon the detail of his practice. Galen, in another place,\r\nremarks that the poisons of certain reptiles occasion jaundice. (De Loc.\r\nAffect. vi, 8.) This fact is confirmed by modern observation. See Van\r\nSwieten (Comment. 916); Dr. Simson (paper on Jaundice, vol. i of the\r\nMedical Essays and Observations); and Rogerius (i, 47.) By the way, the\r\nancients maintained that the primary action of certain poisons is exerted\r\nupon the liver. (See Book Fifth, XLII.)\r\n\r\nAretæus insists that jaundice is produced not only by disease of the\r\nliver, as generally supposed, but likewise by affections of the spleen,\r\nstomach, kidneys, and colon. He further states that jaundice is sometimes\r\nengendered by the condition of the general system. He appears to allude\r\nto non-elimination of the bile. When the biliary ducts are obstructed,\r\nthe bile regurgitates from the gall-bladder, and mixes with the blood\r\nin the liver, whence it is carried all over the body. In this case the\r\nalvine discharges are white, owing to their not being mixed with bile.\r\nWhen the spleen is the seat of the disease, the skin is of a dark yellow\r\ncolour. He maintains that jaundice likewise arises from affections of the\r\nstomach and also of the colon, as digestion is partly performed in the\r\nlatter viscus. But we must not follow out his description any further, as\r\nit is too long for our limits.\r\n\r\nCelsus having described the disease, directs us to cure it by abstinence\r\nfor one day, and then by opening the bowels; if fever is present, the\r\nsuitable remedies are to be applied, but otherwise scammony or bitters,\r\nsuch as wormwood, are to be given. Some, he says, cured the disease by\r\nattenuant food and diuretics, but Asclepiades rejected the latter, and\r\ngave salt water as a purgative. Celsus approves of a salt Greek wine,\r\nbaths, and so forth. During the whole course of the complaint he directs\r\nthe patient to use friction, and take exercise; and if it is winter to\r\nhave recourse to the bath, but in summer to swim in the sea. He approves\r\nof all kinds of exhilarating sports and amusements, whence the disease,\r\nhe says, has got the name of _regius morbus_. Isidorus, in like manner,\r\nsays of it: “Regium autem morbum inde estimant dictum quod vino bono et\r\nregalibus cibis citius curatur.”\r\n\r\nPliny directs us to cure jaundice by producing perspiration with the root\r\nof the cyclaminus or sow-bread.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus says that jaundice is brought on by indigestion, or\r\nby cathartic medicines which have been taken and have not operated.\r\nSometimes, he says, it is attended with enlargement or scirrhus of the\r\nliver, and sometimes, though rarely, the spleen and stomach are affected\r\nsympathetically. If the attack is violent, he does not disapprove\r\nof venesection; after which the sick are to be restored by soothing\r\ntreatment, exercise, and food of easy digestion. The accessory symptoms,\r\nsuch as hardness of the liver, spleen, and stomach, are to be attended\r\nto; and the bile is to be carried off from the system by administering\r\nacrid clysters, and giving infusions of wormwood or wild succory. He\r\nalso approves of sternutatories such as elaterium; of masticatories\r\ngiven while in the warm bath, and of determining to the skin by\r\nsudorifics and medicines which produce pruritus. He also recommends\r\nchange of air, gestation, swimming in water, frequent vomiting excited\r\nby simple means, and acrid food such as capers, squills, &c. He approves\r\nlikewise of giving a thin wine, and the decoction of hellebore when the\r\ndisease is protracted; but disapproves of the indiscriminate use of\r\ncholagogues, cathartics, and diuretics, such as scammony, and colocynth,\r\nwith wormwood, birthwort, St. John’s-wort, anise, &c. He thinks mental\r\nrelaxation and serenity of great consequence to the cure.\r\n\r\nAëtius gives an accurate account of the disease, but his views are very\r\nsimilar to those of Aretæus. He maintains that there are other causes\r\nof jaundice besides obstruction of the duct of the gall-bladder. When\r\nthe affection is not critical, he recommends bleeding and purging. He\r\nsays that strong purging with colocynth, scammony, and other drastics\r\nis required to produce revulsion from the skin. He also approves of\r\ndeobstruents and diuretics, which are to be given while the patient is\r\nin the hot bath. He speaks of sternutatories and sialogogues, like our\r\nauthor. He likewise strongly recommends emetics (iii, 119.)\r\n\r\nThe treatment recommended by Oribasius, Actuarius, Nonnus, and Octavius,\r\nis very little different from our authors. According to Actuarius,\r\nthe colour of the urine which is characteristic of jaundice is the\r\n_cærulean_, that is to say, the colour of a ripe cherry, or of a\r\ndark-coloured wine. (De Urinis, vi, 7.) Theophilus in like manner states\r\nthat the _cærulean-coloured_ urine indicates jaundice. (De Urin. 6.)\r\n\r\nRuffus the Ephesian describes very correctly the situation and use of\r\nthe gall-bladder, and remarks, that when its duct is obstructed jaundice\r\nis produced, in which case the stools are white and clayey. Aëtius’\r\nrecommendation of emetics is upon his authority.\r\n\r\nAlexander Aphrodisiensis states that the constipation of the bowels in\r\njaundice is occasioned by the want of the natural bile, which serves as a\r\nstimulant to the intestines. For the same reason, he adds, the stools are\r\nof a whitish colour.\r\n\r\nAccording to Leo, jaundice arises either from obstruction or from the\r\nconversion of the blood into bile by the heat of the system. He also adds\r\nthat jaundice is sometimes critical.\r\n\r\nThe poet Lucretius (iv, 333) and the philosopher Aristippus take it for\r\ngranted that persons in jaundice see every object tinged with yellow.\r\n(Sextus Empiricus, adv. Math. vii, 195.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Serapion, a redundance of yellow bile in the body is\r\noccasioned either by the system’s not being properly purged of it,\r\nor by an over-secretion of it, or by a combination of these causes.\r\nObstruction, he says, may take place either in the liver itself or in\r\nthe gall-bladder. Sometimes, he remarks, the liver having been inflamed,\r\nbecomes as hard as a stone, or its ducts are obstructed so that the blood\r\nbecomes mixed with bile, and in this state is carried over the whole\r\nbody. He adds, that perhaps the whole gall-bladder is affected, or only\r\none of its ducts, namely, either the superior one, by which it receives\r\nbile from the liver, or the inferior, by which the bile passes down to\r\nthe intestines. In like manner he afterwards states, that sometimes the\r\nsuperior duct losing its tone and becoming obstructed, the bile becomes\r\nmixed with the blood; or, the inferior being obstructed, the bile\r\nregurgitates to the superior, and becomes intermixed with the blood. And\r\nsometimes, he says, the affection arises from the gall-bladder being\r\nover-distended in like manner as the urinary bladder sometimes is. When\r\nthe disease is from obstruction he recommends attenuants, purgatives,\r\nemetics, and the other remedies directed by the Greeks. A similar account\r\nis given by Avicenna. Like Aëtius, he approves of venesection in certain\r\ncases, in opposition to Galen, who, as a general rule, forbids to let\r\nblood in jaundice. (De Purg. Virt.) Avicenna also describes the species\r\nof jaundice connected with disorder of the general system, described\r\nby Aretæus. Avenzoar says that the ducts are obstructed _aut verruca\r\naut pustula_. The exact signification of these terms cannot easily be\r\ndetermined, but it seems probable that they refer to gall-stones. But the\r\nfollowing passage of Haly Abbas puts it beyond a doubt that the ancients\r\nwere acquainted with hepatic calculi or gall-stones: “Some,” he says,\r\n“relate that calculi are formed in the liver, cæcum, and colon.” (Theor.\r\nix, 34.) Haly directs us, when jaundice is connected with inflammation,\r\nto bleed, and purge with myrobalans, hepatic aloes, &c. He also makes\r\nmention of emetics among his general remedies. When connected with\r\nobstruction, particularly of the gall-bladder, he recommends bleeding\r\nat the arm, a decoction of wormwood, hiera, scammony, and various\r\nremedies of a like nature. To remove the yellow colour of the eye he\r\nrecommends the tepid bath, and the application to the eyes of the fumes\r\nof vinegar. For the cure of jaundice of the spleen, he prescribes the\r\ncommon remedies, and mentions one which he says he learnt from _a woman_,\r\nand found very effectual. It was a draught containing lentils, fennel,\r\nand the urine of a boy not come to puberty. Jaundice being a disease\r\nwhich often goes off without any remedies, has been, in all ages, a\r\nfavourite with empirics. Alsaharavius treats of the disease in much the\r\nsame terms; recommends bleeding when it is connected with an inflammatory\r\ncause, and attenuants, bitters, purgatives, and the hot bath according\r\nto circumstances. Rhases, who gives a very full account of jaundice,\r\nstates that the disease generally arises from obstruction either in\r\nthe liver or its ducts. He particularly recommends drastic purgatives,\r\nsuch as scammony, along with wormwood, fennel-seed, and the like. When\r\ninflammatory symptoms are present he approves of bleeding and the warm\r\nbath.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT.

Depilatories have always been made of similar ingredients\r\nto those which enter into our author’s prescriptions, that is to say,\r\narsenic and quicklime have generally entered into the composition of\r\nthem. The following is one from Baptista Porta: “Constat vivæ calcis\r\npartibus quatuor, redactis in pulveris modum, auripigmenti singulari, et\r\ndecoque.” (Mag. Nat. ix, 4.)\r\n\r\nIt appears from many passages in the Roman Satirists that the practice of\r\napplying depilatories to the obscene parts was common in ancient times.\r\nPersius says:\r\n\r\n    “Tu cum maxillis balanatum gausape pectis,\r\n    Inguinibus quarè detonsus gurgulio extet?”\r\n\r\n                                (Sat. iv, 37.)\r\n\r\nSee the learned note of Casaubon; also, Juvenal (Sat. viii, 114),\r\nand the note of the Dauphin editor. The Fathers inveigh against this\r\nimmodest practice. See Tertullianus (de Pallio), and Clemens Alexandrinus\r\n(Pædagog. ii, 3.) According to Athenæus, the Tuscans were anciently much\r\ngiven to the use of depilatories. (Deipnos. xii, 14.) See also Apuleius\r\n(Metamorph.)\r\n\r\nAs this subject possesses little interest now, we need not enlarge upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LIII.—ON BUBONOCELE, ENTEROCELE, AND HYDROCELE.\r\n\r\nProtrusions of the bowels occasioned by rupture of the peritonæum are of\r\na very difficult nature, but those from relaxation are of easier cure;\r\nfor happening commonly to children of a humid temperament, they, for the\r\nmost part, can be cured without a surgical operation, by the application\r\nof remedies and suitable bandages. The under-mentioned remedies are to\r\nbe applied; but I must mention, in the first place, that these diseases\r\ndiffer in situation only; for, when the intestine remains in the groin,\r\nit is called Bubonocele, and when it falls down into the scrotum, it\r\nis named Enterocele. Wherefore, take of pomegranate-rind, dr. x; of\r\nunripe gall-nuts, dr. v; boil in three cyathi of austere wine; pound\r\nand apply, having previously reduced the intestine and bathed the part\r\nwith cold water. Loose it in ten days; the patient remaining on his\r\ncouch thirty days, and drinking of the decoction of cypress with wine;\r\nor of cypress balls, three oboli, in diluted wine. This medicine is\r\napplicable to children.—_Another agglutinative application_: Of the roots\r\nof comfrey, of the juice of horehound, of bitter almonds, of gum, equal\r\nparts.—_Another_: Of turpentine, oz. iss; of wax, of frankincense, of\r\nmyrrh, of isinglass, of snails with their shells, of each oz. j; macerate\r\nthe ichthyocolla previously in vinegar for three days.—_Another_:\r\nOf cypress-balls, i. e. spherical fruit, oz. j; of galls, oz. j;\r\nof pomegranate-rind, oz. ss; of taurocolla, oz. iij; of manna, of\r\nfrankincense, oz. ss; of comfrey, oz. ss; of snails with their shells,\r\noz. j; boil the balls and rind in astringent wine for a considerable\r\ntime; triturate; mix the other ingredients, and when they are added,\r\nuse.—_Another_: Of aloes, of pomegranate-rind, of frankincense, of the\r\njuice of hypocistis, of artificers’ glue, of pitch, of bitumen, oz.\r\niss; of sweet wine, q. s.—_Another more complex application, which will\r\nanswer also with adults, when the disease is not of long standing_:\r\nOf chrysocolla, of taurocolla, of sarcocolla, of ichthyocolla, of\r\ngagate-stone, of blood-stone, of Syrian sumach, of manna, of acacia, of\r\neach, oz. iss; of the stone pyrites, of native sulphur, of the breathing\r\nmagnet, of fissile alum, of manna, of frankincense, of each, oz. j; of\r\nBrutian pitch, oz. v; of snails with their shells, oz. j; of the dross\r\nof silver, oz. iv; of galls, oz. j; of squamæ stomomatis (_scales of\r\nsteel?_), oz. j; of copper, oz. j; of bitumen, oz. vj; of myrtle-oil, q.\r\ns.; mix the dry things with astringent wine, until the preparation is of\r\nsuch a thickness as not to stain, and then use. If they cannot lie in a\r\nrecumbent posture, bind the application firmly with a triangular bandage\r\nof thick materials and sufficient to retain the intestine. Let them\r\nabstain from flatulent food, much wine, frequent baths, strong motion,\r\nsuch as running, leaping, loud crying, and the like. For hydrocele, so\r\nas to evacuate the fluid: Of pepper, c grains; of bay-berries, lxxx;\r\nof nitre, dr. xx; of wax, dr. xl; mix with half a hemina of oil, and\r\nuse.—_Another excellent application_: Of the flower of Assian stone,\r\ndr. vj; of grapes deprived of their stones, dr. ij; of Ethiopian cumin,\r\ndr. viij; of red nitre, dr. viij; having triturated, apply, fomenting\r\nwith it late and early.

As these diseases will be treated of more fully in the Sixth\r\nBook, it is unnecessary to say much about them at present.\r\n\r\nOur author is most indebted to Aëtius (xiv, 22.) Nonnus recommends\r\nastringent applications of a similar nature. (192.) When there is\r\ndifficulty of reduction, Rhases directs the use of the warm bath\r\nperseveringly. Haly Abbas remarks that protrusion of the bowels will\r\nsometimes occasion constipation, pain, and death. He says nothing of an\r\noperation for relieving the strangulation. Alsaharavius declares that\r\nhe had found all the applications recommended for the cure of these\r\ncomplaints utterly ineffectual after they are fairly formed. He directs\r\nus to return the protruded parts, and secure them by means of a bandage,\r\nalong with a pad of lead and a plaster of pitch, &c. The Surgical\r\ntreatment of these complaints is minutely described in the Sixth Book.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LIV.—ON INFLAMMATION OF THE TESTICLE AND SCROTUM, AND ON THE OTHER\r\nDISEASES OF THESE PARTS.\r\n\r\nYou may recognize inflammation of the scrotum from the pain being felt at\r\nthe slightest touch of the hand, and from the heat and hardness appearing\r\nintense; whereas, when the testicle is inflamed, a slight touch does\r\nnot give pain, which is only felt when the part is firmly pressed by\r\nthe fingers, while the redness and hardness appear less at the surface;\r\nbut, upon grasping it firmly, a deep-seated hardness meets the fingers;\r\nand fever is sometimes present. To inflammations of the testicles, in\r\nparticular, venesection is applicable at the ancle; and to all these, in\r\ngeneral, cataplasms and cerates. Cataplasms are to be applied, of the\r\nflour of beans boiled in diluted wine, with fat dried grapes deprived\r\nof their stones; or, boil the root of cumin or asphodel, and, having\r\npounded, mix with an equal part of the flour of dried barley-meal,\r\nand apply as a cataplasm; or, linseed in diluted wine; or, fenugreek\r\nin honied water; or, the root in honied water; or, the recent lees of\r\nwine, with the flour of barley-meal; or, groundsel and green coriander,\r\nwith dried grapes deprived of their stones. But if there is much heat,\r\napply a cataplasm of the leaves of henbane with wheat-flour, or that of\r\nchick-peas; or, of the leaves of sweet-flag, or of unripe gourd. When\r\nthe affection is protracted, and attended with hardness, boil the root\r\nof wild cucumber in honied water, and, having triturated with the flour\r\nof darnel, apply as a cataplasm. And this is an excellent remedy: Of\r\ndried grapes deprived of their stones, oz. v; of boiled chick-peas, oz.\r\niss; of cumin, oz. j; of sulphur, oz. ix; of nitre, oz. j; of rosin, oz.\r\niiiss; triturate altogether with honey, and apply as a cataplasm. The\r\nfollowing are convenient cerates: Of oil, one cyathus; of Colophonian\r\nrosin, oz. vj; of plumbago, of cumin, of dried grapes, of the flour of\r\nbeans, of each, oz. iv; of wax, oz. ij; boil the plumbago with the oil\r\nto a proper consistence, then add the wax and rosin, and, taking it off\r\nthe fire, pour it half cooled upon the pounded figs and flour.—_Another_:\r\nOf the oil of dill and of roses, of wax, of pine-rosin, of each, oz. v;\r\nof cumin, oz. iiss; of asses’ dung, oz. iss; triturate the cumin with\r\nthe asses’ dung, and when the cerate is cooled mix and levigate; then,\r\nplacing in a rag, use, applying above it wool out of oil from unripe\r\nolives; or, use equal parts of butter and rosin. If from sweats there\r\nbe ulcers in the scrotum, sprinkle powdered gall or alum upon fat and\r\ngoats’ gall, and anoint. For testicles affected with aphthæ: Having first\r\nanointed with Cimolian earth and water, allow it to dry, and wash with\r\nwarm water; then, having triturated dried myrtle and a small quantity of\r\nalsander, apply as a cataplasm. Excrescences upon the testicles are cured\r\nby the application of the lixivial ashes of the vine mixed with wine and\r\nwater. When there is pruritus of the scrotum, triturate finely nitre,\r\nstavesacre, dried figs, and moist alum with vinegar and rose-oil, and\r\nanoint with it in the bath; but after the bath, rub in the white of an\r\negg with honey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. On diseases of the obscene parts, consult Hippocrates\r\n(Epidem. v, 4, et alibi); Galen (Sec. loc. ix; Loc. Affect. vi, 6);\r\nCelsus (iv, 21, viii, 18, vi, 18); Aretæus (Morb. Chron. ii, 5);\r\nOribasius (Loc. Affect. iv, 102); Aëtius (xi, 32, xiv, passim); Actuarius\r\n(Meth. Med. i, 15, iv, x); Nonnus (192); Alexander (viii, 9, 10); Cælius\r\nAurelianus (Pass. Tard. v, 5); Marcellus (32); Octavius Horatianus (ii,\r\n11); Moschion (de Morbis Mulierum); Scribonius Largus (233); Avicenna\r\n(iii, 20, 1, 2); Avenzoar (ii, 3); Haly Abbas (Theor. ix, 37; Pract.\r\nviii); Alsaharavius (Pract. xxii); Rhases (Divis. 79; ad Mansor. ix, 101;\r\nContin. xxiv.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates relates a case of prurigo scroti which was removed by hot\r\nbaths, but the patient afterwards became dropsical and died.\r\n\r\nMany of our author’s remedies are taken from Galen, but he has copied\r\nmost closely from Oribasius and Aëtius.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of inflammation of the testicles, as laid down by Celsus,\r\nis very judicious, namely, bleeding at the ankle, a cataplasm of the\r\nflour of beans boiled in mulse with pounded cumin and boiled honey, and\r\nother similar applications. When it becomes indurated, linseed or the\r\nseed of fenugreek boiled in mulse, or the like, are to be applied. When\r\nthe testicles swell from a blow, blood must necessarily be extracted from\r\nthem, more especially if they are livid.\r\n\r\nAvicenna is particularly full upon these and all the other diseases\r\nof the obscene parts. For pruritus of the testicles and scrotum he\r\nrecommends bleeding, cupping in the vicinity of these parts, the\r\napplication of leeches, hot fomentations with acacia, sal ammoniac, &c.,\r\nand the other remedies mentioned by Paulus. For apostemes he directs\r\nus to bleed in the arm and ankle, and to use applications similar to\r\nthose of our author. Rhases recommends bleeding in the arm and ankle,\r\nand at first cold applications, consisting of vinegar and rose-water,\r\nwhich, if the complaint does not abate, are afterwards to be exchanged\r\nfor suppurative ones. Haly’s treatment is nearly the same. Alsaharavius,\r\nlike Avicenna, treats inflammation of the testicles by bleeding in the\r\narm and ankle, and using various local applications of a cooling nature.\r\nFor pruritus he recommends applications containing ceruse, sulphur,\r\nnitre, sal ammoniac, and strong vinegar. Rhases mentions that he had an\r\nenlargement of the right testicle for which he took an emetic, whereby a\r\nmanifest reduction of the swelling was produced, and by a repetition of\r\nthis process the complaint was entirely removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LV.—ON GONORRHŒA AND LIBIDINOUS DREAMS.\r\n\r\nGonorrhœa is an involuntary discharge of semen, taking place frequently\r\nwithout erection of the privy member, owing to weakness of the retentive\r\nfaculty. In this case it will be proper to keep the patient in a state\r\nof rest, covering the loins and pubes with compresses out of wine, oil\r\nof apples, or that of the flowers of the wild vine; and cataplasms may\r\nbe afterwards applied, made of dates, apples, flowers of the wild vine,\r\nacacia, hypocistis, sumach, and the like. He may also be made to sit in\r\na hip-bath of the decoctions of lentisk, of bramble, and the like, in\r\nwine, or even in water, and use desiccative food. After a little while,\r\nhe may take gymnastic exercises, by which both the general system and the\r\naffected parts will be restored to strength. Redundance of semen has been\r\ntreated of sufficiently in the First Book, under the head of Hygiene;\r\nand there, too, impotence is treated of. A cool couch is beneficial in\r\ncases of libidinous dreams; also, laying on the right or left side; all\r\nmedicines of a cold nature rubbed into the loins, such as coriander,\r\nhemlock, ceruse, and purslain, all of which are to be used with vinegar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Celsus recommends strong friction, affusion of cold liquids,\r\nswimming in cold water, food and drink of a cooling nature, avoiding\r\neverything flatulent and calculated to engender semen, applications such\r\nas rue and vinegar to the part, avoiding lying upon the back, and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nAretæus, in his chapter on Gonorrhœa, makes some very ingenious\r\nspeculations on the effect which the semen genitale exerts upon the\r\ndevelopment of the moral character. He remarks that a long-continued\r\ndraining of the semen sometimes occasions paralysis: he alludes to the\r\ntabes dorsalis, a disease well described by Hippocrates. He properly\r\nstates that gonorrhœa proceeds from relaxation of the genital organs.\r\nWith regard to the treatment, he recommends at first cooling and\r\nastringent applications to stop the flux, but these are afterwards to\r\nbe exchanged for calefacients and rubefacients. Castor, mint, and the\r\ntheriac are to be taken internally, along with strong exercise.\r\n\r\nGalen defines gonorrhœa to be an involuntary emission of semen, arising\r\nfrom debility of the genital organs, especially of the spermatic vessels.\r\n\r\nAëtius gives a full account of gonorrhœa from Galen, and of oneirogmon\r\nfrom Philagrius, but his treatment is little different from our\r\nauthor’s. For the latter he directs the patient to take such things as\r\nare calculated to prevent the formation of semen, as rue, calamint, the\r\nchaste-tree, &c.; and further recommends astringent and refrigerant\r\napplications, lying on a hard bed, wearing a plate of lead on the loins,\r\nand abstaining from the usual provocatives to venery.\r\n\r\nThe practice of Alexander is exactly the same as that of Aëtius.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus treats oneirogmon upon much the same principles,\r\nnamely, by cooling applications and injections, the cold bath, astringent\r\nfood, and so forth. He makes mention of a disease of the genital organs,\r\nwhich we have met with in practice, although we do not recollect to have\r\nseen it noticed in any modern author, unless Heberden alludes to it\r\n(Comment. 80.) It is an emission of bloody semen _in actu venereo_. He\r\ndirects it to be treated by astringent and restorative remedies.\r\n\r\nFor oneirogmon, the Pseudo-Dioscorides recommends an infusion of the seed\r\nof lettuce and purslain, the decoction of nymphæa, &c. (Euporist. ii,\r\n100.) Dioscorides himself recommends hemlock. (Meth. Med. iv, 79.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna and Rhases follow the treatment of our author. For the\r\noneirogmon, Haly Abbas recommends various refrigerant and sedative\r\nmedicines, such as purslain, coriander, lentils, fleawort, poppies,\r\nroses, &c. For gonorrhœa he recommends bleeding; emetics if connected\r\nwith repletion; sleeping in a cold place; various anodyne, astringent,\r\nand refrigerant medicines, such as henbane, poppies, roses, lettuce, &c.\r\nHe also directs a plate of lead to be worn over the loins. Alsaharavius\r\ntreats minutely of these complaints according to the nature of the\r\nexciting cause. His general remedies for gonorrhœa are of a refrigerant\r\nand cooling nature, such as citrons, pomegranates, lettuces, henbane,\r\n&c. with a plate of lead and other cooling applications. For oneirogmon\r\nhe recommends liniments of camphor and opium, lying on a hard bed, and\r\nrefrigerant medicines. Rhases recommends styptic applications, snow, the\r\nplate of lead, and the cold bath. He speaks also of rubbing the parts\r\nwith myrrh, henbane, and opium.\r\n\r\nOn the pollutio nocturni somni referred to in Deut. xiii, 13, see\r\nIsidorus (Comment. in Deut. 20.) Pliny treats of certain herbs which\r\nexcite, and others which dispel, the “somnia veneris.” Martial, in\r\nhis epigram addressed to Ponticus, expresses himself in terms of just\r\nabhorrence against the detestable vice of manustupration. Galen, however,\r\nrelates a story of it with disgusting _sang froid_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LVI.—ON SATYRIASIS.\r\n\r\nSatyriasis is a palpitation of the genital organ, accompanying some\r\ninflammatory affection of the spermatic vessels, with erection; and, if\r\nthe palpitation do not cease, it is apt to terminate in paralysis of\r\nthe spermatic vessels, or in spasms. Those affected with convulsion die\r\nspeedily, having at last inflation of the belly and cold sweats. This\r\ncomplaint sometimes, though rarely, affects women. Wherefore we must open\r\na vein without loss of time, keep the patient upon a spare diet without\r\nwine, and purge the belly, not freely but gently, every day. The best\r\narticles of food are beet, mallows, a little of the herb mercury, and the\r\nsoup of the shell-fishes. A simple clyster is no bad remedy. Diuretics\r\nmust be avoided; and medicines of a cold nature are to applied to the\r\nloins, such as the juice of nightshade, of purslain, of henbane, or of\r\nhemlock. It may be necessary, also, to rub the penis and the perineum\r\nwith some soothing and cooling things, such as litharge, Cimolian earth,\r\nand ceruse, dissolved in vinegar, water, sweet wine, or rob. It is\r\nhurtful to lie on the back. He may drink of the root of water-lily, iris,\r\nand maiden-hair. Rue is beneficial both in gonorrhœa and satyriasis.\r\nGive, likewise, food from grain in small quantity, and do not gratify the\r\nthirst. When the affection is protracted, cupping with scarifications,\r\nmay be had recourse to; or, if a plethora be present, we may evacuate by\r\nleeches. A cataplasm of raw barley-meal may also be applied to the belly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Aretæus has drawn a lively but disgusting picture of a person\r\naffected with this complaint, which it is to be hoped that the “march of\r\nimprovement” in morals has now rendered of rare occurrence. He calls it\r\na most unseemly disease. According to his account, it will even prove\r\nfatal occasionally, and that within the space of seven days. He says\r\nthe natural cure of it is a diarrhœa coming on with bilious discharges.\r\nThis venereal mania, he says, is to be cured by bleeding from the arm or\r\nankle to deliquium animi, purging with hiera, and wrapping the genital\r\norgans and adjoining parts with wool dipped in rose-oil and wine, or\r\nin decoctions of such narcotics as hemlock, nightshade, mandrake or\r\npoppy; the applications in either case being frequently changed. When\r\nthese things do not succeed, the neighbouring parts are to be cupped or\r\nleeched; and in case of necessity the afore-mentioned refrigerants are to\r\nbe changed for calefacients, such as the oil of privet, or the Sicyonian\r\noil. This treatment, he remarks, will prove soothing to the nerves. He\r\nalso recommends castor and a refrigerant diet, from which wine and flesh\r\nare to be excluded. It appears, therefore, that our author’s treatment is\r\nmostly taken from him.\r\n\r\nOribasius pronounces satyriasis to be a fatal symptom in acute fevers;\r\nand Professor Sprengel confirms the justness of this observation. (Hist.\r\nde la Méd. t. ii, 188.)\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus gives a very circumstantial account of this disease.\r\nHis treatment differs from that of Aretæus in this respect—that he\r\ndisapproves entirely of the refrigerant applications, and, instead of\r\nthem, recommends soothing ones, namely, emollient oils, a hip-bath of\r\noil and water, and the like. He approves also of bleeding, cupping, and\r\nleeching.\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus treats it upon nearly the same principles, that is\r\nto say, he recommends fomentations with the vapours of hypocistis or\r\nhemlock, hard friction, exercise, and astringent food.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing original in the treatment of the Arabians. Haly Abbas\r\nrecommends calefacient and desiccative medicines internally, such as\r\nagnus castus, rue, cumin, &c. He also permits the use of narcotics with\r\ndesiccants, such as coriander, henbane, lettuce, and opium. To the member\r\nhe directs us to apply a cataplasm containing the oil of roses, lettuce,\r\ncoriander, and camphor; and when this fails, some opium is to be added.\r\nHe enjoins hard exercise.\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius recommends much the same treatment as our author, namely,\r\nbleeding from the arm or foot, diluent and refrigerant draughts, cooling\r\napplications containing vinegar, ceruse, &c.; and, if these do not\r\nsucceed, leeches.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LVII.—ON PRIAPISM.\r\n\r\nPriapism is a permanent enlargement of the penis, which is swelled both\r\nin length and circularly, and there is no venereal appetite attending\r\nit. The part is swelled by a flatulent spirit engendered from viscid and\r\ngross humours by a moderate heat. It is clear, therefore, that the part\r\nis not to be heated but cooled moderately, with rose-cerate beat up with\r\nwater, and with the cerate of chamomile applied to the penis and loins.\r\nThe diet and medicines should be of an attenuant nature, without being\r\nmanifestly heating. We must also apply those things which are found, by\r\nexperience, to be naturally efficacious. We may, therefore, give them\r\nalso to drink of the water-lily and the seed of the chaste-tree, and\r\nmix green rue with their condiments. Yet this must not be given at the\r\ncommencement, since it is heating, but after the use of other attenuants.\r\nIf we practise evacuation, it must be by vomiting; for that by the belly\r\noften occasions a defluxion to the neighbouring parts. Exercise and\r\nfriction are to be had recourse to for dispelling the flatus. In none of\r\nthe cases which we have been mentioning does coition answer, unless when\r\nwe have reason to suppose that there is a redundance of semen owing to\r\nrestraint from enjoyment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Many of the ancient authorities make no distinction between\r\nsatyriasis and priapism, but, according to Cælius Aurelianus, the former\r\nis an acute and the latter a chronic disease. Prosper Alpinus, the\r\nmodern Methodist, says, there is this difference between satyriasis and\r\npriapism—that in the former there is violent venereal desire, whereas, in\r\nthe latter, there is continued erection, but no desire nor emission of\r\nsemen. It seems, in short, to be a sort of chronic chordee.\r\n\r\nOur author, Oribasius, Aëtius, and Actuarius, follow the principles of\r\ntreatment laid down by Galen. The latter speaks of the anti-aphrodisiacal\r\nmedicines mentioned by our author.\r\n\r\nAlexander forbids the use of such things as are of an intensely cold\r\nnature, especially astringents and narcotics. He recommends friction,\r\nexercise of the upper parts of the body, and abstinence from flatulent\r\nfood. All incentives to venery are of course to be avoided.\r\n\r\nAvicenna agrees with the Greek authorities respecting the\r\nanti-aphrodisiastical properties of rue. Like them, he recommends\r\nemetics, but disapproves of drastic purgatives. When the affection\r\nis of an inflammatory kind, Haly Abbas recommends general bleeding,\r\ncupping, leeches, and applications of a cooling nature, such as\r\nvinegar, purslain, solatrum, gourd, &c. Alsaharavius recommends various\r\nrefrigerant and anodyne remedies, internally and externally.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LVIII.—ON IMPOTENCE OF THE PARTS.\r\n\r\nThose having this complaint have lost their venereal desires, and have\r\nbecome depressed in spirits on that account. The cause of it is a\r\nparalysis of the parts, or a defect of semen. Those things which engender\r\nsemen are treated of under the head of Hygiene in the First Book; and\r\nthere, too, the incentives to venery of a simple nature are mentioned;\r\nand we must now add those which are stronger. Wherefore we must use\r\nin general those applications called acopa which are recommended for\r\nparalysis; but in particular levigate a burnt swift (_stellio_), and,\r\nadding oil to it, anoint the great toe of the right foot, and then try\r\nthe venereal act; and when you wish to give over, wash away the ointment\r\nfrom the toe. And the composition from swifts called polymigmaton is a\r\nvery efficacious application; or propomata from medicines which rouse\r\nto erection must be taken, such as this: Of pepper, of pine-nuts, of\r\nMacedonian parsley, of the shavings of hartshorn, of turpentine, equal\r\nparts; mix with honey.—_Another_: Of raw chick-peas, of pine-nuts, of\r\neach, oz. ij; of rocket, of pepper, of each, oz. j; mix with honey, and\r\ngive two drachms in wine. And the compound medicine called satyriaca,\r\nand such like, will be applicable. But we must also attend to the other\r\ncauses of the complaint, and apply remedies corresponding to them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This Section is mostly abridged from Aëtius (xi, 35.)\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus recommends moderate exercise, friction of the\r\nextremities, and particularly of the groins, with pepper, euphorbium,\r\nand the like; applying plasters (dropaces) of the same to the groins and\r\nloins, or making suppositories of them; giving flatulent food, such as\r\nrocket, pepper, and the seeds of tares; lying upon a downy bed; having\r\nthe attendance of females; and indulging in obscene reading.\r\n\r\nSee a long list of aphrodisiacal medicines in Myrepsus (40); and in\r\nAvicenna (iii, 20, 1, 18.) In the latter we remark the nettle, lupine,\r\nrocket, asparagus, parsley, cresses, beans, cinnamon, and an animal\r\ncalled _dabet alurel_, which we conjecture to be the stellio or swift.\r\nHaly Abbas treats minutely of this affection, according as it arises\r\nfrom paralysis of the part or defect of semen. In the latter case, as he\r\nconsiders the state of the parts to be connected until a dry and cold\r\nintemperament, he recommends juicy flesh, beans, vetches, sweet wine, and\r\nso forth. He approves of a hot bath in which violets have been boiled. He\r\nalso gives calefacients, such as rocket, ginger, asparagus, onions, and\r\nthe like. Alsaharavius mentions various causes of impotence. One of them\r\nis, “excessus delectationis ad illam quam diligit.”\r\n\r\nThe aphrodisiacal properties of rocket are mentioned by Juvenal (Sat.\r\nix, 134.) See also Pliny (H. N. xix, 6.) Juvenal appears to allude to\r\naphrodisiacal friction. (Sat. vi, 52.)\r\n\r\nAthenæus gives a marvellous account of the efficacy of aphrodisiacal\r\nmedicines. (Deipnos. i, 11.) See the thirty-sixth Section of the First\r\nBook of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LIX.—ON MATTERS RELATING TO THE GENITAL ORGANS AND ANUS.\r\n\r\nUlcers on the pudenda and about the anus, when free from inflammation,\r\nrequire very desiccative applications, such as that from burnt paper,\r\ndried burnt dill, and burnt gourd. For humid and recent ulcers, aloes\r\nis a good application, when sprinkled on them dry in a fine powder. But\r\nthe medicine which gives least pain, and is as efficacious as any other,\r\nis pompholyx. If the ulcers are more humid, the bark of the pine by\r\nitself and bloodstone are proper; but if the ulcers are also deep, manna\r\nmust be mixed with them; and if the ulcer be spreading, we must apply\r\na cataplasm of dried lentil with pomegranate-rind, and use the plaster\r\ncalled Coracum from oxymel, the trochisk called Bithynus, and that from\r\npaper. Fissures in the privy parts and anus are remedied by roasted rosin\r\n(_colophony?_) rubbed with rose-oil, so as to become of the consistence\r\nof bath-sordes, and having the yelk of an egg and opium mixed; or the\r\nashes of the dried leaves of ivy burnt, when pounded with rose-oil in a\r\nleaden mortar, may be applied. And the trochisk from wine and oil and\r\nthat from Phrygian stone are excellent applications for fissures and foul\r\nulcers about the corona glandis, more especially when the prepuce cannot\r\nbe drawn back.—Another simple application, which also blunts acrimony:\r\nOf cadmia burnt and washed, oz. ij; of the rose-leaves stripped of their\r\nnails (i. e. the white parts of the leaves), oz. vj; sprinkle it dry,\r\nhaving first wiped the part with wine.—The following is an application\r\nfor condylomata: Of chalcitis, of uncleansed wool, of cerate, of hart’s\r\nmarrow, of bramble-leaves, equal parts, with cerate; and that from wine\r\nand oil in like manner. But if a concealed ulcer is found on the penis\r\nwithin its opening (_the urethra_), which is discovered from pus or\r\nblood being evacuated without urine, it may be cured by first washing it\r\nwith honey diluted with much water, and then with milk, and then mixing\r\nwith the milk the collyrium of aster; or the white trochisk, or that\r\nfrom lotus is to be put into a leaden mortar, and the parts anointed, by\r\ndipping a feather in it; and then a small twisted tent of scraped linen\r\nmay be anointed with it and applied. A most excellent application is the\r\none containing of galls, of pompholyx, of starch, and of aloes, equal\r\nparts, triturated with rose-oil and the juice of plantain.\r\n\r\n_For pains of the privy parts._ Apply equal parts of butter and of rosin,\r\nboth properly melted; or apply equal parts of myrrh and of roasted rosin\r\n(_colophony or fiddlers’ rosin?_) triturated with the juice of the\r\nplantain.\r\n\r\n_For swelling of the penis._ Of tender vine-leaves, dr. j; of ceruse,\r\ndr. v; triturate and apply; bathe with cold sea-water; enjoin rest; and\r\napply bandages to the penis. The lixivial ashes of vine-twigs applied\r\nwith vinegar cure thymous tumours of the penis, and do not permit them\r\nto increase again; and so in like manner the ashes of the burnt bark\r\nof willows. In general the thymus, myrmecia, and acrochordon will be\r\neradicated by strongly corrosive applications, and become dead when\r\ntreated with septics. But, in particular, elaterium when applied with\r\nsalts is useful, also unripe figs with vinegar, nitre, and flour, and\r\nthe juice of the fig when rubbed in; the burnt head of an anchovy\r\npickled, verdigris calcined with native sulphur, the juice of tithymallus\r\n(_spurge?_) when rubbed in, the leaves of basil with copperas, or the\r\nfruit of the large sunflower applied with wine.\r\n\r\n_For inflammation of the anus._ Of ceruse, oz. iv; of pompholyx, oz.\r\nj; or of soft cadmia, of frankincense, oz. j; of the juice of endive,\r\none hemina; mix, adding the juice by degrees until it be all consumed,\r\nand then having made a cerate of two ounces of wax, and one pound of\r\nrose-oil, mix; and having shaved the part, soften with this strongly.\r\nInject by an instrument for extricating pus, and apply a bandage above.\r\nIt is of use for inflammatory fissures, and ulcers of the anus attended\r\nwith heat or pruritus.\r\n\r\n_For erysipelas about the anus._ Of diachylon plaster, lb. j; of\r\nrose-oil, q. s; of pure bread, lb. j; of saffron, oz. j; of opium, oz.\r\nj. The saffron and opium are macerated in must, and the bread in water;\r\nthen, when they are pounded, the diachylon and rose-oil are put into them\r\nand allowed to soften. It is also applicable to gout attended with the\r\ngreatest heat.—_Another, applicable also to inflammation of the anus_:\r\nTriturate ceruse with wine and rose-oil in a leaden mortar with a leaden\r\npestle, anoint with it; or, having triturated ceruse, the white of an\r\negg, and rose-oil in the same mortar until it become of the consistence\r\nof bath-sordes, anoint with it.\r\n\r\n_For acute pain of the anus._ Of the tender leaves of henbane, of the\r\ntender leaves of purslain, of crumbs of bread soaked in wine, of the\r\nyelks of roasted eggs, equal parts; of rose-oil, q. s. After fomenting\r\nthe part with the decoction of roses and melilots, apply this cataplasm.\r\n\r\n_An excellent application for inflammation of the anus, and, excrescences\r\nthereof._ Of ceruse, of litharge, of ammoniac perfume, of bdellium,\r\nof each, scr. vj; of turpentine, oz. j; of wax, oz. ss; triturate the\r\npowders with the juice of nightshade, of henbane, or of purslain; and\r\nhaving mixed the soluble articles, take, and having softened them with\r\nrose-oil, use. And the composition called Phicotyche, and that from\r\nplumbago, are excellent applications for inflammations of the fundament.\r\nAnd the trochisks from lotus, from winter-cherry, and that from roses are\r\nesteemed applications for the anus and privy parts.\r\n\r\n_For excrescences of the anus._ When these excrescences are inflamed, we\r\nmust use the general applications already mentioned, and in particular\r\nthe following trochisk: Of ceruse, oz. iij; of pompholyx, oz. j; of\r\nlitharge, oz. ij; of mastich, scr. iij, add to the juice of henbane.\r\nWhen they are free from inflammation, sprinkle the ashes of burnt\r\ncypress balls, having first washed the parts with wine, or the ashes of\r\nthe burnt peel of dried gourd, or of the bones of dates in like manner,\r\nor the ashes of eggshells and of fennel; or having mixed the juice of\r\npomegranate leaves with an equal portion of white wine, wash with it for\r\nseven days. For callous excrescences: Triturate quicklime and arsenic\r\nwith strong vinegar. It will answer well if you anoint with it in the sun.\r\n\r\n_On hemorrhoids or piles._ When piles discharge more than is proper, the\r\nconsequence is, that the system is reduced to a watery state, and they\r\nlose their appetite. There is risk both from the hemorrhage becoming too\r\nprofuse, and from its being altogether suppressed; and therefore the\r\ntreatment is attended with difficulty. Wherefore, when the piles are\r\nnumerous, one ought always to be left for the sake of purging the system.\r\nSome also are seated high up and do not make their appearance, which\r\nrenders them difficult to be cured. Blind piles discharge nothing, but\r\nare on that account more painful than the others. On them, therefore, rub\r\nthe juice of sow-bread, which will open them. For immoderate discharges,\r\ntake of the Egyptian thorn, of the leaves of the elder, of mugwort,\r\nof each, oz. v; boil in eight heminæ of water to one-half, and add\r\nof ironwort oz. iv. The herbs are then to be thrown away, and to the\r\ndecoction the following things are to be added in powder: Of melanteria,\r\nof round alum, of each, dr. viij; of litharge, dr. iv; of galls, oz.\r\niij; of misy, dr. ij; of endive, dr. ij. Dissolve this powder in the\r\ndecoction, and bathe with it seven times in the day; but on the following\r\nday bathe with an equal quantity of another preparation of the same kind,\r\nand on the third in like manner. If any part of them remain on the fourth\r\nday, pierce it with a needle, and if it has any feeling, or bleeds,\r\nprepare a decoction like the former, but add only one-half of the powder;\r\nbut when you have washed until it touch with the powder, that they may be\r\nproperly burnt. For the inflammation apply a bread-poultice.—_Another_:\r\nHaving soaked pure bread in primary sauce, and haring burnt it in a\r\nnew pot, triturate, and apply it, having first bathed with wine. It\r\nis applicable also to excrescences.—_Another_: Of endive, dr. ij; of\r\nchalcitis, dr. j; of misy, dr. j; of copperas, dr. iij; of fissile alum,\r\ndr. ix; of burnt copper, dr. j; of melanteria, dr. j; use in a powder.\r\nThe food for those who have immoderate discharges should be such as\r\nforms but little blood, and is not excrementitious, of a desiccant\r\nand astringent nature, such as chondrus soaked in oxycrate, rice, and\r\nhalica, and of pot-herbs, intybus, succory, and purslain, and of wines\r\nsuch as are astringent. For blind piles, food of an opposite description\r\nis proper, but particularly the fish called calamary, the cuttle-fish,\r\npolypus, the torpedo, and the cartilaginous fishes; for these things\r\nraise a tumult in the blood. Emmenagogues are also proper remedies in\r\nthis case.\r\n\r\n_For procidentia ani._ Of the fruit of heath, of galls, of ceruse, of\r\nacacia, of the juice of hypocistis, of pine-bark, of frankincense, of\r\nAminæan myrrh, equal parts; apply in a powder, having first bathed with\r\naustere wine.—_Another_: Of the dross of lead, of Syriac sumach, of each,\r\noz. viij; of the flowers of roses, dr. iv; of Aminæan myrrh, dr. ij; use\r\nlike the first.—_Another_: Of pine-bark, of manna, of litharge, of each,\r\ndr. viij; of dried cypress balls, of plumbago, of each, dr. ij; use as\r\ndirected above. Bathing with the patient’s own urine while yet warm is\r\nalso useful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Consult most of the works referred to in the fifty-fourth\r\nSection.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this Section is almost entirely taken from Galen (sec.\r\nloc. ix); the remainder seems to be abridged from Aëtius (xiv.) Galen\r\n(Meth. Med. v, 15) insists strongly that diseases of the penis should be\r\ntreated with desiccative instead of epulotic applications.\r\n\r\nNo ancient author has treated so fully of diseases of the genital member\r\nas Celsus (vi, 18.) His description of the ulcers upon it is very minute.\r\nUlcers, he remarks, are found either upon the prepuce, or on the glans,\r\nor beyond it on the member itself. If dry, they are first to be bathed\r\nwith warm water, and then lycium (catechu?) out of wine, or the lees\r\nof oil boiled with the same, or butter with roses is to be applied. If\r\nthere is a slight discharge, they are to be washed with wine; then honey\r\nand a fourth part of turpentine-rosin are to be added to the butter and\r\nroses for an application. When there is a purulent discharge it is to be\r\nwashed away, and the part dressed with an application containing pepper,\r\nmyrrh, saffron, and misy, boiled in austere wine to the thickness of\r\nhoney. He mentions various other escharotics containing ærugo, alum, and\r\nthe like. When at any time inflammation comes on, a cataplasm must be\r\napplied. Spreading ulcers are to be treated with applications containing\r\nthe escharotics we have just mentioned. When a watery sanies runs from\r\nthe sore it is to be treated with basilicon (tetrapharmacon) melted with\r\nroses and some frankincense; and it is to be frequently bathed with hot\r\nwater and covered up from the cold. The tubercles called phymata are to\r\nbe burnt down with medicines or a cautery of iron, and when the crust\r\nfalls off, the squama æris is to be sprinkled on the part. Cancerous\r\nsores are to be extirpated by escharotics, as by a composition of\r\nquicklime, chalcitis (sulphate of copper?) and arsenic; or they are to\r\nbe cut out and the part burnt. Phagedænic sores in like manner are to be\r\nburnt with medicines or the actual cautery.\r\n\r\nAvicenna approves of Galen’s rule of treatment stated above. When sores\r\nare recent, he recommends in particular aloes, and when more humid,\r\nburnt copper. When an incarnant is required, frankincense is to be\r\nmixed. Prurigo is to be cured by venesection, purging, and liniments\r\ncontaining nitre, alum, sal ammoniac, or even stavesacre with vinegar\r\nor rose-oil. For prurigo, Alsaharavius recommends lotions of sea-water,\r\ndecoctions of chamomile, saffron, and camphor pounded with vinegar, and\r\nthe like applications. For hard pustules he recommends various corrosive\r\napplications, some of which contain arsenic. Haly Abbas remarks that\r\nulcers on the genital membranes are attended with the same symptoms as\r\nthose on other parts.\r\n\r\n_On diseases of the anus._ Celsus has likewise treated very fully of\r\nthese complaints. For rhagadia or fissures he recommends first the hot\r\nbath, and afterwards cooling ointments, such as old oil with litharge,\r\nand unwashed wool spread with a composition of liquid cerate and roses.\r\nThe regimen is thus tersely pointed out: “Liquida, lenia, pinguia,\r\nglutinosa, meliora sunt.” The tubercle called condyloma is said to derive\r\nits origin from inflammation, and is to be treated at first by making the\r\npatient sit in a hip-bath of water having vervain boiled in it; and then\r\nlentil with some honey, or a composition containing chalcitis, or alum\r\nwith ceruse and litharge, or the like, is to be applied. If these do not\r\nsucceed, the escharotics, such as verdigris, antimony, &c., or even the\r\nmore powerful caustics are to be used. He treats hemorrhoids upon much\r\nthe same plan as our author. He begins by inculcating that there is\r\ndanger in suppressing them suddenly. They are to be treated at first upon\r\nthe soothing plan, by baths, emollient applications, and those directed\r\nfor fissures. When these fail, strong caustics are to be applied, such as\r\nthe composition consisting of arsenic, squama æris, and quicklime. Next\r\nday they are to be pierced with a needle. In certain cases he prudently\r\ndirects bleeding from the arm. Procidentia ani is to be treated in the\r\nfirst place by fomenting the gut with austere wine and the like, and\r\nreplacing it; and then applying the leaves of willow boiled in vinegar, a\r\nlinen compress, wool, and a bandage. Fungous ulcers are to be bathed with\r\ntepid water, if in winter, or with cold if at any other season; and then\r\nsprinkled with squama æris, or dressed with a cerate containing the same\r\nwith quicklime, &c. If these do not succeed, the parts must be burnt with\r\npotential or actual cauteries.\r\n\r\nGalen remarks that diseases of the anus are difficult to cure, because\r\nthe part is possessed of great sensibility, and is exposed to be\r\nirritated by the alvine discharges, which contain bile, ichor, and the\r\nlike. Styptic substances, which do not produce much irritation, are most\r\nproper for them, such in particular are many of the metals. He gives\r\na long list of applications recommended by Andromachus, Asclepiades,\r\nand others, the principal ingredients of which are ceruse, litharge,\r\nalum, rose-oil, and the like. For procidentia ani he recommends various\r\nastringent applications containing galls, sumach, roses, pomegranate\r\nrind, burnt lead, litharge, &c.\r\n\r\nAëtius gives a long account of these complaints, but we must be content\r\nwith a brief summary of it. He treats procidentia ani in the first place\r\nwith astringent applications, containing galls, hypocistis, austere wine,\r\nand the like; but when these things do not succeed, he directs us to burn\r\nthe verge of the anus with the actual cautery. Hemorrhoids he advises us\r\nto extirpate with the knife; but when the patient will not submit to this\r\noperation, he directs us to burn them with caustics, such as arsenic,\r\nquicklime, and the like. He recommends various combinations of these\r\nmedicines for condyloma, acrochordon, and thymus.\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus may be consulted with advantage; but as his general\r\nplan of treatment is not very different from that of Celsus, we shall not\r\ngive an abstract of it.\r\n\r\nFor rhagadia Marcellus recommends a composition of litharge and rose-oil.\r\nHe gives an interesting description of the process of curing hemorrhoids\r\nby an application containing arsenic, chalcitis, misy, and the like. This\r\nremedy is strongly recommended by the Pseudo-Dioscorides. He says that a\r\nmixture of equal parts of arsenic and sandarach will make them drop off\r\nin half an hour. (Eupor. i, 214.)\r\n\r\nThe Arabians treat these diseases upon the same principles. Avicenna\r\ndescribes three kinds of hemorrhoids. The first kind are like warts;\r\nthe next are of a bloody nature; and the third are intermediate between\r\nthese. He treats them, like the others, either by a surgical operation,\r\nor by powerful caustics, containing arsenic, quicklime, and the like.\r\nWhen hemorrhoids are gross, and do not yield to ordinary treatment, Haly\r\nAbbas directs us to apply septics, such as arsenic, quicklime, &c.; and\r\nwhen they become black, to dress them with ceruse ointment, or a mixture\r\nof rose-oil and the whites of eggs. Procidentia ani he treats, like\r\nCelsus, with astringents, such as galls, hypocistis, recrementum ferri,\r\n&c. For fissures he recommends emollient ointments containing ceruse,\r\nbasilicon, wax, &c. Alsaharavius also approves of septic applications\r\ncontaining arsenic, &c. When the piles are old and callous, however,\r\nhe prefers the surgical operation. He also prudently recommends gentle\r\npurgatives. Rhases directs, in cases of procidentia ani, when the anus\r\nis swelled, and the gut cannot be got readily replaced, the patient to\r\nbe put into a warm bath and emollient applications used; afterwards\r\nastringents are to be substituted, and a bandage applied. He recommends\r\nus to extirpate hemorrhoids with the knife, the cautery, or caustic\r\nmedicines; but advises bleeding in the first place. He says that when\r\ndressed with sandarach they speedily drop off. In prolapsus, when the\r\nanus is swelled, he directs us to bathe the parts with a decoction of\r\nmallows, &c., then to smear them with mucilaginous substances; to replace\r\nthe gut, and secure it with a bandage.\r\n\r\nThe primary sauce mentioned in this Section of our author is thus\r\nexplained by Lister: “Liquamen optimum. Istud garum a Paulo Ægineta\r\nvocabatur πρωτειον, seu primarium, quod nobilissimum illud esset.” (Ap.\r\nApicium, vii, 6.) It was called garum nigrum and garum sociorum by the\r\nRomans. (Galen, Med. sec. loc. iii.) It is thus described by Martial:\r\n\r\n    “Expirantis adhuc scombri de sanguine primo,\r\n    Accipe fastosum munera cara garum.”\r\n\r\n                               (Epigr. xiii, 56.)\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Geoponics’ it is called garum hæmation.

LX.—ON AFFECTIONS OF THE UTERUS; AND, FIRST, OF THE MENSTRUAL\r\nDISCHARGE.\r\n\r\nWith most women the menstrual discharge begins about the fourteenth year\r\nof their age; a few have it earlier, in their thirteenth or twelfth;\r\nand not a few are later than their fourteenth in having it. There is no\r\nlimited time for the continuance of it, many having it only for two or\r\nthree days, most women for five days, some for seven, and a very few have\r\nit for twelve days. The menses cease about the fiftieth year of age, a\r\nfew have them till sixty, and with some they begin to disappear about\r\nthirty-five, particularly with such as are fat. When, therefore, the\r\nevacuation is delayed, it will be proper to have recourse to baths and\r\npotions before the expected period, such as the frequent draughts from\r\nsesame, or the headed leek boiled together with pepper and rue. But they\r\nmust be drunk in Cretan sweet wine. Having drunk a cotylé of it, let the\r\nwoman excite the flow of the menses by walking; and let her eat calamary,\r\ncuttle-fish, and polypus, and other things of the same kind, for they are\r\nparticularly adapted for raising a tumult in the blood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The following is a list of the ancient authors on midwifery:\r\nHippocrates (de Nat. Mulieb.; de Morbis Mulier.; de Steril.); Galen (de\r\nMed. sec. loc. ix, et alibi); Aretæus (Morb. Chron. ii, 11); Oribasius\r\n(Med. Collect, iv; Synops. ix); Ruffus Ephesius (i); Actuarius (Meth.\r\nMed. iv); Aëtius (xvi); Soranus (de Arte Obitat.); Nonnus (103); Celsus\r\n(iv); Octavius Horatianus (iii); Pseudo-Dioscorides (Euporist. ii, 80);\r\nMoschion (de Morb. Mulier.; Isagoge Anatomica, xxix); Meletius (de Nat.\r\nHom. 24, seq.); Marcellus (de Medicam. xxxiii); Eros (apud Gynæcia);\r\nPliny (H. N. xxviii, xxx); Avicenna (iii, 21); Serapion (v); Avenzoar\r\n(ii, 5); Averrhoes (Collig. iv, 60); Albucasis (Chirurg. ii); Haly Abbas\r\n(Theor. ix, 39; Pract. viii); Alsaharavius (Pract. xxv); Rhases (ad\r\nMansor. ix; Contin. xxii.)\r\n\r\nThe ideas entertained by the ancients respecting the nature of the\r\nmenstrual discharge may be best learned from Aristotle (de Generat.\r\nAnimal, i, 19.) Our limits will not permit us to do justice to his\r\ntheory of conception. It may be proper to state, however, that he holds\r\nthe menses to proceed from a sanguineous superfluity (περίττωμα) in the\r\nsystem. This theory found a strenuous advocate in his great commentator\r\nAverrhoes (Collig. iii, 29); and Button’s views on this subject are very\r\nlittle different. Hippocrates, in like manner, taught that the male semen\r\nis a superfluity collected from all parts of the body, and fancied that\r\nif any part of the parent was maimed, the semen was defective, and gave\r\nrise to a similar defect in the child engendered. (De Aere et Aquis, 52.)\r\nPythagoras called it the froth of the blood and the superfluity of the\r\naliment. (Plutarch de Placitis Philos. v, 3.)\r\n\r\nDutens gives a learned account of the ancient theories on the generation\r\nof animals. Suffice it to say, that Empedocles, Hippocrates, Aristotle,\r\nand most of the philosophers taught that all animals derive their origin\r\nfrom ova; but that Democritus and a few others maintained that they are\r\nproduced from spermatic animalcules. (Origine des Découvr.)\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been the popular belief in ancient times that the moon\r\nexercises a certain influence on the womb; and hence Homer refers the\r\nsudden deaths of women to Diana. See Eustathius (ad Iliad, xx, 59.)\r\n\r\nWe may allude in this place to the ancient belief in superfœtation. See\r\nHippocrates (de Superfœt.) Asclepius, a commentator on this work, relates\r\na singular case from his own personal knowledge. (T. ii, 470, ed. Dietz.)\r\nAristotle relates several curious cases of superfœtation. (H. A. vii, 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXI.—ON RETENTION OF THE MENSES.\r\n\r\nThe menstrual evacuation is sometimes retained owing to a weakness of the\r\nwhole body, and sometimes owing to a particular affection of the uterus\r\nitself, from local coldness, or a blow, or a congenital intemperament,\r\nor from some sustained injury, for the most part from abortions, or from\r\na primary affection of some of the more important organs, such as the\r\nliver, belly, and chest, or from some such part labouring under a chronic\r\naffection. When suppressed, it becomes the cause of many and protracted\r\ncomplaints. If, therefore, the discharge be suppressed or delayed, owing\r\nto a primary affection of any of the internal parts, we must first direct\r\nour particular attention to the cure of the part originally affected,\r\nand afterwards think of the uterus. The symptoms of these we have\r\nalready mentioned. When none of them therefore is present, it is clear\r\nthat the uterus is the original seat of the complaint; and when neither\r\nthe age, habit, nor any other thing prevents, we must have recourse to\r\nvenesection, yet not before the regular period of menstruation, but ten\r\ndays after it is past. The quantity to be taken must not be more than two\r\npounds and a half, nor less than one; and whether we bleed or not, we\r\nmust purge with the hiera of colocynth, giving it to the amount of two\r\ndrachms, in six heminæ of honied water. But when fever is present, it\r\nis not expedient to purge with hiera, but it will be advisable to open\r\na vein during the first days of the fever. After the purging, we must\r\ngive recruiting things for a few days, and afterwards recommend exercise\r\nby walking, friction of the lower extremities, and the bath. The most\r\nproper food will be that which is of easy digestion and humid, such as\r\nall sweet pot-herbs, and fishes taken from among rocks, the more tender\r\nparts of fowls, milk, honied cakes, thin white wine not very old; flesh\r\nand pulse, except ptisan, are improper. When the accustomed period is at\r\nhand, give of sea-fishes the cartilaginous, and the mollusca, as they are\r\ncalled, and the testacea, and headed leeks (_porrum capitatum_), boiled\r\nwith rue and pepper; and let the woman drink the decoction of them, and\r\napply ligatures to the lower extremities for three or four days. When\r\nthe expected period is at hand, the ligatures are to be removed, and\r\nshe is to take beforehand fragrant draughts of myrrh, to the amount\r\nof an obolus, or the size of a bean; or of castor with must, or with\r\nhonied water; or the decoction of mugwort; or of sage after the bath in\r\nmust, and in that of wormwood. The wine of wormwood should be drunk as\r\na propoma during the whole time of treatment. When the period has gone\r\npast, and no discharge, or at least none of any consequence has taken\r\nplace, we must open a vein at the ankle, and abstract blood; but after\r\nthe seventh or eighth day we must purge with hiera; and after the fourth\r\nday a calefacient plaster (_dropax_) is to be applied to the lower part\r\nof the belly, loins, and thighs. Having drunk water for three days,\r\nlet a cataplasm, made of equal portions of mustard and soaked bread,\r\nbe applied until the equinox, after which let the patient bathe. Next\r\nmonth, let dried figs instead of bread be mixed with the decoction of\r\nfenugreek, of mallows, of pennyroyal, of rue, and of mugwort. And let oil\r\nof lilies (_susinum_) or of marjoram be injected into the vagina; and\r\nlet the pessary called Enneapharmacus, or the Olibanius be introduced.\r\nA pessary consists of carded wool, rounded to the shape of the finger,\r\nand impregnated with the medicines. This mode of treatment is generally\r\nsufficient for restoring the menstrual evacuation; but if stronger\r\nmedicines are required, they are as follows: Illyrian iris drunk with\r\nwine and cyperus, the root of wakerobin, cassia, the schenanth, valerian,\r\na decoction of the root of elicampane, myrrh to the size of a Grecian\r\nbean drunk with must in half a hemina of honied water, and two heminæ of\r\nthe decoction of dittany, and ammoniac, and sagapene. To persons whose\r\nstomachs are less easily deranged, a small quantity of opopanax, made\r\ninto a little ball, and steeped in boiled honey, may be given. Moreover,\r\ncertain common seeds are calculated to promote the menstrual evacuation,\r\nbut in an inferior degree, such as fennel, cumin, parsley, Cretan carrot,\r\nhartwort, bishop’s weed, sison, chick-peas, juniper-berries, and all the\r\ndiuretics. But the following things are to be applied _per vaginam_:\r\nMyrrh triturated with the decoction of wormwood, or of lupines; or\r\ntriturated with the juice of rue; bdellium, in like manner; storax, the\r\ngum of the wild olive, and that of the juice of rue, in like manner; or\r\nthe long birthwort made into the form of a collyrium; and so also the\r\nroot of the great centaury, or of hellebore, or of the juice of scammony,\r\nand the medullary part of the wild gourd by itself, and mugwort formed\r\nwith rue and galbanum, applied in the form of a fumigation. These things\r\nare calculated also to expel the fœtus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. One may find in Hippocrates a long list of medicines\r\npossessed of real or imaginary virtues as emmenagogues; such as\r\ncantharides, myrrh, peony, cumin, elaterium, squills, the fruit of\r\njuniper, seseli, thyme, St. John’s wort, rue, castor, elicampane, nettle,\r\nsage, &c. Of these some were given by the mouth, and others applied\r\nupon pessaries. He also recommends fumigations with aromatics. The\r\npessaries were supposed to be likewise capable of producing abortion;\r\nbut Hippocrates, in his Oath, forbids to give them to pregnant women.\r\nIt appears from Juvenal that fœticide was a very common practice in his\r\ntime (see Sat. vi); and various methods of performing it are described by\r\nAvicenna (iii, 21, 2), which we forbear to explain, lest our pages should\r\nbe instrumental in increasing the frequency of this disgusting crime. It\r\nwould seem that the ancient Lydians practised some Malthusian process to\r\nprevent conception. See Athen. (Deip. xii, 11, with the notes of Casaubon\r\nand Schweigh.) Aristotle says that, with this intention, some anointed\r\nthe os uteri with oil of juniper, or with ceruse and frankincense mixed\r\nwith oil. (H. A. vi, 3.) Aëtius makes mention of a mixture of alum,\r\ngalbanum, with wine, &c. being used for this purpose. (xvi.)\r\n\r\nAlthough Galen has treated very fully of this disease in different\r\nparts of his works, and has explained satisfactorily the nature of\r\nemmenagogues, we shall pass him by on the present occasion, in order\r\nto afford us more room for doing justice to the views of Aëtius, whose\r\naccount of amenorrhœa we consider decidedly the best we ever met with.\r\nAëtius says that barren and pregnant women, singers, and dancers do not\r\nmenstruate, the menstrual superfluity in the latter being consumed by too\r\nmuch exercise. It is undoubtedly true, as he remarks, that those who take\r\nstrong exercise have less discharge than women who lead an indolent life.\r\nSometimes, too, he says, a fat or lean state of the body will occasion\r\nsuppression of the menses, because fat persons have too little blood in\r\ntheir veins, it being consumed in forming the fat; and hence too they\r\nseldom conceive, or, if they do, their offspring is puny. In those, too,\r\nwho are much emaciated, the necessary sanguineous superfluity is wanting.\r\nThe menses may likewise be suppressed from disease, such as loss of\r\nblood, profuse perspirations, vomiting, purging, or cutaneous eruptions.\r\nCallosities, cicatrices, and other diseases of the uterus will likewise\r\noccasion suppression. His treatment is judiciously varied according to\r\nthe cause of the complaint. Suppression, he says, brings on heaviness,\r\ntorpor, pain of the loins, of the hindhead, of the root of the eyes, &c.\r\nWhen suppression arises from _a hot temperament_, it is to be treated\r\nwith cooling and diluent food, such as ptisan, milk, lettuces, domestic\r\nkids and lambs, tender fishes and fowls, grapes, cucumbers, and a white\r\nwatery wine. Baths of common water are to be used. When connected with _a\r\ncold temperament_, the patient is of a pale leaden colour, and her urine\r\nwatery. She is to live upon food of a heating nature, with a generous\r\nfragrant wine, or the wine made with salt water, and must take active\r\nexercise. The suitable medicines are those of a calefacient nature,\r\nsuch as thyme, calamint, cassia, spikenard, or savin, taken in a white\r\nold wine. He also recommends myrrh, assafœtida, opopanax, castor, sage,\r\nrue, cumin, and the like, all of which are to be taken immediately after\r\nthe bath; and when these do not succeed, he directs us to purge or give\r\nan emetic. Pessaries too may be used, but the more acrid substances,\r\nsuch as elaterium, cantharides, and white hellebore, must be rejected,\r\nas they are apt to occasion irritation and inflammation. Of his long\r\nlist of prescriptions for pessaries, we shall merely notice the one\r\nconsisting of turpentine, myrrh, honey, and saffron. When occasioned by\r\n_fatness_, the principal reliance is to be put upon an attenuant diet,\r\nbut suitable fomentations and potions must not be neglected. Guarded\r\npurging with drastic cathartics, such as scammony or spurge, has often a\r\ngood effect. Strong pessaries are likewise proper. When the suppression\r\nis connected with _plethora_, the patient experiences pains about the\r\nloins and lower part of the belly at the accustomed period, and a marked\r\nfulness of the veins is perceptible. It is to be cured by copious\r\nbleeding either from the arm or foot, by quietude, and the use of common\r\nfomentations. Restriction as to the bath and food must be enjoined.\r\nWhen connected with _emaciation_, the constitution is to be recruited\r\nby suitable exercise and regimen, not neglecting pessaries and potions.\r\nWhen occasioned by _vitiated humours_, such as bile or phlegm, the body\r\nis to be purged with the proper medicines, and the parts fomented.\r\nFragrant articles are to be mixed with the food. The pessaries are to\r\nbe made of elaterium, sow-bread, or the like, if bile prevails; but of\r\nanemone, pepper, or colocynth, if phlegm. When _a bleeding at the nose_\r\nis the cause of suppression, it is to be cured by sweating, vomiting,\r\nor other evacuations. But in this case, and when the suppression arises\r\nfrom barrenness or excessive labour, no marked inconvenience is felt,\r\nonly conception cannot take place. When occasioned by _an indolent course\r\nof life_ the proper remedies are suitable labour, exercise, gestation,\r\na thin white wine, and living on attenuant and humid food. When the\r\ncomplaint is not connected with any of the causes or states above\r\ndescribed, it is to be presumed that it is occasioned by some organic\r\ndisease, which must be treated accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe same subject is well treated of by Avicenna, but we cannot afford\r\nroom for even an outline of his account. Like our author, he approves of\r\ntight ligatures around the thighs, bleeding from the saphena; and among\r\nhis emmenagogues we remark savin, musk, castor, and myrrh. All these\r\noccur also in Scrapion’s list. Haly Abbas recommends baths medicated with\r\nvarious stimulant articles, such as fennel, rue, chamomile, parsley,\r\n&c. He mentions pessaries and suppositories, or tents prepared with\r\nattenuant and stimulant medicines, such as myrrh, wild marjoram, rue,\r\nsavin, hellebore, colocynth, wormwood, bulks gall, &c. He also speaks\r\nof fumigations with the vapours of aromatics, such as castor, olibanum,\r\nlignum aloes, &c. He approves of bleeding from the saphena, and of\r\napplying cupping-instruments to the thighs, especially when there is any\r\ndetermination to the nose. When connected with corpulence, he enjoins\r\nstrong exercise, attenuant food, restricted diet, and purgatives.\r\nAlsaharavius treats fully of this complaint upon nearly the same plan as\r\nAëtius. He says the stronger emmenagogues are wild mint, juniper, black\r\nhellebore, mastich, myrrh, colocynth, gentian, &c. To relieve the pains\r\nwhich sometimes precede menstruation, he recommends the tepid bath,\r\nmoderate exercise, and attenuant food. Rhases recommends bleeding at the\r\nankle, savin, purging with hiera, black hellebore, &c.; pessaries of the\r\nsame, the hot bath, and stimulant friction.\r\n\r\nEros strongly recommends repeated bleeding at the ankle, the tepid bath,\r\npurgatives, diuretics, and emmenagogues, such as savin, calamint, myrrh,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXII.—ON IMMODERATE MENSTRUATION AND UTERINE HEMORRHAGE.\r\n\r\nImmoderate discharges in women take place, sometimes from retention of\r\nthe menses which break out more copious than usual, and sometimes after\r\nparturition at the full time, when they cease spontaneously for the most\r\npart; and frequently after miscarriages, when a violent hemorrhage often\r\ntakes place, and proves dangerous. In the first place, then, we must\r\napply ligatures round the members, at the armpits and groins; give to\r\ndrink oxycrate not cold; sprinkle with oxycrate; and apply to the parts\r\na large quantity of wool squeezed out of wine and oil, or rose-oil, or\r\noil of apples, or myrtle-oil. For food, we may give chondrus soaked in\r\noxycrate, or rice, or alica; but prohibiting wine, we may give austere\r\nhydromel, omphacomel, or the like. The patient may take propomata of\r\npomegranate flowers in oxycrate, or the juice of hypocistis, or of\r\nacacia, or lycium, or Samian earth, or unripe grapes dried, or rhubarb,\r\nor the ashes of cork burnt in an Italian earthen vessel; or she may eat\r\nsesame soaked in oxycrate until it become soft. The following substances\r\nintroduced into the vagina stop hemorrhage: The juice of hypocistis,\r\nor of acacia, with manna, being triturated with vinegar. An admirable\r\napplication is a sponge soaked in wine or liquid pitch, and applied;\r\nor the ashes of it burnt when applied with vinegar or oxycrate; and in\r\nlike manner the ashes of cork burnt in an Italian earthen vessel. But\r\nastringent epithemes applied externally are beneficial; and cataplasms\r\nfrom dates and quinces, containing also pomegranate rind, or the tops\r\nof bramble, or acorns of the holm oak, or the leaves of lentisk, wild\r\npomegranate flowers, acacia, hypocistis, galls, or alum; but more\r\nparticularly the following: Taurocolla is macerated in oxycrate until\r\nit is dissolved, and is then spread upon a strong rag, and glued to\r\nthe loins. The agglutinative plasters are also powerful remedies, such\r\nas the Harmonium, Icesium, Athena, Melinum, Indicum, and the like.\r\nPessaries are to be used for the hemorrhage; mixing the inner part of\r\ngalls powdered and rosemary with water, apply; or the flowers of the\r\ncultivated pomegranate, or the sweet pomegranate in like manner, or\r\npowdered knotgrass. The following is a compound one: Of fissile alum,\r\nof the inner part of galls, of the juice of acacia, of manna, of each,\r\ndr. iv; the yelks of four roasted eggs; these powders are rubbed with\r\nthe juice of plantain, and mixed. In using it a pessary of wool is\r\nimpregnated with it, dipped into rose-oil, and applied. And dry-cupping\r\nby large instruments applied frequently under the nipples acts powerfully\r\nby revulsion. The following is a composition for a hip-bath, in which a\r\nperson having hemorrhage may sit: Of the heads of sharp rush, of myrtle,\r\nof roses, of the leaves of rhamnus, of bramble tops, equal parts; boil\r\nin water, which let the patient use for a hip-bath.—_Another_: Of the\r\nbark of sweet pomegranate-root, of myrtle, of the rind of cypress, of\r\neach, p. iij; of galls, p. j; boil in a sufficient quantity of water.\r\nInject with an uterine syringe the decoction of plantain, or of endive,\r\nor of knotgrass, or of nightshade, or of perdicium, or of fleawort, or\r\nof hypocistis, or of acacia; and let these things also be applied with\r\nwool, or by the finger, or a speculum, or a long-shaped feather, to the\r\nmouth of the uterus. And the trochisk of Andron, when injected by an\r\nuterine syringe, with some of the decoctions formerly mentioned, or with\r\nastringent wine, is an active remedy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Aëtius gives a very full account of these complaints, but\r\nnearly in the same terms as our author. He condemns the practice of\r\napplying sponges soaked in cold posca, because, he says, they prove\r\ninjurious to the uterus by producing too much coldness. Galen remarks\r\nthat pregnant women have sometimes discharges of blood from the veins of\r\nthe os uteri. We can attest the correctness of this statement.\r\n\r\nOribasius and Actuarius treat these complaints like our author.\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus directs us to subject the parts to the vapours of\r\nsuch astringent articles as pomegranate-rind, roses, and galls; or to\r\napply to the parts a sponge soaked in posca, or wool squeezed out of some\r\nof the styptic juices. He also recommends us to produce revulsion by\r\nmeans of cupping-instruments applied to the breasts. He further directs\r\nus to apply to the parts epithemes of astringents, especially Theban\r\ndates boiled in wine or vinegar.\r\n\r\nMoschion gives a very sensible account of uterine hemorrhages, for which\r\nhe recommends perfect quietude and sponging with cold water and vinegar,\r\nor if that fail, with astringent decoctions, &c.\r\n\r\nSoranus, in like manner, gives a very accurate detail of the symptoms and\r\ntreatment of uterine hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nRhases recommends venesection (but does not point out the cases in which\r\nit is applicable); astringent trochisks containing the recrementum ferri;\r\ncupping-instruments applied to the breasts; stuffing the vagina with\r\nwool smeared in the mixture of frankincense, wild pomegranate-flowers,\r\ngalls, antimony, acacia, and alum. He also recommends epithemes, and when\r\nthese things do not succeed, pessaries made with escharotics. In uterine\r\nhemorrhage after delivery, he recommends cold astringent applications,\r\nand bandages to the extremities. Haly Abbas correctly remarks that\r\nuterine hemorrhage sometimes proceeds from plethora of the system, in\r\nwhich case he properly recommends bleeding. When connected with thinness\r\nof the blood, he recommends incrassant food. He also makes mention of the\r\nusual astringent applications consisting of galls, vinegar, and the like.\r\nSerapion and Alsaharavius lay down similar rules of practice. Avicenna,\r\nhowever, is the fullest of the Arabian authorities upon menorrhagia.\r\nLike Haly, he states that it sometimes proceeds from plethora, when he\r\nrecommends us to produce revulsion by bleeding at the arm. When connected\r\nwith debility, he prescribes astringents. When it proceeds from ulcers,\r\nhe approves of a combination of agglutinative, astringent, and narcotic\r\nmedicines. His general treatment during an attack is almost the same\r\nas that recommended by Paulus. He mentions acidulated water, vinegar,\r\ncamphor, alum, galls, &c. Some of his prescriptions contain opium, which\r\nis an anticipation of the modern practice in such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXIII.—ON THE FEMALE FLUX.\r\n\r\nThis is a defluxion of the uterus, by which the whole body is purged.\r\nWherefore that which is evacuated is of the same colour as the prevailing\r\nhumour. It is red when from the ichorous part of the blood; white, from\r\nphlegm; pale, from bitter bile; and black from black bile; and sometimes\r\nit is watery. If the blood is discharged pure as in venesection, we must\r\nattend carefully, lest there be any erosion of the uterus. The flux is\r\nrecognized by the following symptoms: The parts are moistened with fluids\r\nof various colours; the patient is pale; is not nourished; and loathes\r\nher food; and is affected with difficulty of breathing when she walks;\r\nher eyes are swelled; and the discharge sometimes is accompanied with\r\npain, and sometimes without it; with ulceration or without it; and the\r\nulceration is inflammatory, foul, or clean. Wherefore, when the affection\r\nis of a humid nature, we must endeavour to remedy the general system by\r\nadministering such things as are desiccants, without being manifestly of\r\na heating nature. The whole body is to be rubbed, and anointed with honey\r\nproperly boiled, and we must give diuretic medicines, such as water in\r\nwhich asarabacca and parsley have been boiled, and evacuate the whole\r\nbody by the bowels. In addition to these, purslain when eaten, and the\r\njuice of it when drunk, are beneficial. Also the flowers of the wild\r\npomegranate, the fruit and flowers of bramble, that part of an oak which\r\nis under the membranous part of the trunk, and that which is below the\r\npeel of the acorn. Horse-tail in particular stops a red discharge, when\r\ndrunk with water or wine; or hypocistis; the fruit of lentisk sodden\r\nwith wine and drunk; Samian aster, Lemnian earth, the rennet of a hare,\r\nor of a kid, or of a lamb, or of a calf, or of a stag; grape-stones\r\ntriturated, myrtles, dried unripe grapes, the bark of the pine, and those\r\nthings recommended for uterine hemorrhage, unless the most drastic.\r\nWhen the flux is attended with pain, we must inject with an uterine\r\nsyringe, or clyster instrument, the juice of alica, or of ptisan, or of\r\ntragus, or of rice, with some of the anodyne medicines. And during the\r\nexacerbations we must soothe; but during the remissions (for it has its\r\nperiods) we must try to alter the system by different kinds of gestation,\r\nwalking, vociferation, anointing, cupping, dropaces to the parts above,\r\ninsolation, friction, depilatories, detergent ointments, sinapisms,\r\nemetics from radishes, a restorative regimen, baths, wine, and variety of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. By the term _female flux_, Ruffus describes the complaint now\r\ncalled the _whites_; but our author applies it to any vitiated state of\r\nthe menstrual discharge.\r\n\r\nHippocrates has given a very good description of the symptoms which\r\nsometimes attend leucorrhœa, namely, swelling of the face, paleness of\r\nthe countenance, enlargement of the belly, anasarca of the limbs which\r\npit upon pressure, short breathing, debility, and so forth. He admits the\r\ndifficulty of curing such complaints, but directs it to be attempted with\r\ndiuretics, epithemes, masticatories, a desiccative diet, and exercise. He\r\ndetails many interesting histories of the complaint.\r\n\r\nThe account which Aretæus gives is nearly the same as our author’s. It\r\nis sometimes, he says, attended with a white discharge, and sometimes\r\nwith a red, of which there are several varieties. It occurs at irregular\r\nperiods, and in some instances when it continues long it will prove fatal\r\nby hemorrhage. The symptoms are various according to the nature of the\r\ndischarge. His chapter on the treatment is lost.\r\n\r\nAëtius has treated of the red flux and of the white separately. When\r\nthe discharge is red, he begins with venesection, and then applies to\r\nthe parts sponges soaked in astringent decoctions, the preparation of\r\nwhich he has described at great length. When the discharge is white, he\r\nrecommends gestation, vociferation, walking, friction, and applications\r\nwhich are both astringent and detergent. Galen correctly remarks that\r\nwomen of a loose phlegmatic habit of body are most subject to the whites.\r\n\r\nOribasius and Nonnus are little different from our author.\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus approves of an astringent and desiccative regimen.\r\nHis advice is to produce vomiting frequently with radishes, to use\r\nexercise gradually increased, to change the air frequently, and to apply\r\ndepilatories, calefacient plasters, and sinapisms to the part. If the\r\ndischarge is copious, and attended with pain, he advises bleeding.\r\n\r\nEros recommends fumigations with the vapours of various herbs, after\r\nwhich calefacient oils are to be applied upon wool to the part.\r\n\r\nThe works of the Arabians contain nothing remarkable on this head.\r\nHaly Abbas recommends venesection when the discharge is bloody; but,\r\nif it consist of other humours, he directs us to administer medicines\r\nwhich promote their discharge; and also to use astringent and stimulant\r\npessaries. Alsaharavius recommends the same medicines, and likewise in\r\nparticular the warm bath.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXIV.—ON INFLAMMATION OF THE UTERUS, AND CHANGE OF ITS POSITION.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the uterus takes place from several causes; for it\r\nmay arise from an injury, from retention of the menses, from cold and\r\ninflation, not unfrequently from abortions, and from parturition after\r\na misconception. Inflammation of the uterus is accompanied with acute\r\nfever; pain of the head and tendons, of the balls of the eyes, of the\r\nwrists and of the fingers; retraction of the neck, and retroversion;\r\nsympathy of the stomach; and the mouth of the womb is shut up; the pulse\r\nsmall and dense. If the inflammation be weak, they have not violent\r\npain in the uterus; but if it be strong, the pain is of the pulsatory\r\nkind, which, when the whole of the uterus is affected, darts through\r\nthe whole of it, but when the inflammation is confined to a spot, the\r\npain indicates the seat of it. When, therefore, the posterior parts only\r\nare inflamed, the pain is in the loins, and hardened lumps of fæces are\r\nconfined by the compression of the rectum; but when the anterior parts\r\nare affected the pain is seated at the pubes, and there is strangury\r\nor dysuria from pressure on the bladder. When the sides are inflamed,\r\nthere is tightness of the groins and heaviness of the limbs; but when\r\nthe fundus is affected the pain is principally near the navel, with\r\nswelling thereof; and when the inflammation is in its mouth there is\r\npain in the hypogastrium, and if the finger be introduced _per vaginam_,\r\nthe mouth of the womb will feel hard and unyielding. As to the treatment\r\nwe must, in the first place, use embrocations of wine and oil, or of\r\nwine and rose-oil to the pubes and loins, by means of folds of clean\r\nwool without a bandage; and abstinence from food is to be persevered\r\nin for three days, after which we are to let blood from the arm, if\r\nnothing contraindicate. The patient is to be supported with chondrus\r\nout of honied water, bread, or soft eggs, every alternate day. But\r\nafter the fifth day we are to apply a cataplasm made of fine flour,\r\nlinseed, or fenugreek, with honied water, in which the heads of poppy\r\nhave been boiled and thrown away, and oil along with them. But if the\r\ninflammation be of an erysipelatous nature, and cannot endure heat, boil\r\nmelilot in must, and having pounded, add the yelks of roasted eggs, with\r\nrose-oil, oil of apples, or of saffron, and apply as a cataplasm; or\r\nhaving boiled dates in diluted wine, pound with fine polenta, and some\r\nof the afore-mentioned ointments, and apply as a cataplasm; and when\r\nthe complaint is on the decline add the cerate of nard or of privet.\r\nThroughout the whole treatment the patient must sit in hip-baths prepared\r\nfrom the decoction of fenugreek, linseed, mallows, mugwort, and oil; and\r\nthose who cannot bear these heating things must use rose-oil dissolved\r\nin hot water. Recourse must be had to pessaries, and injections prepared\r\nfrom the sordes of unwashed wool and butter, stag’s marrow, the grease\r\nof geese, the ointment called Susinum, and Tuscan wax. When the patients\r\ncan endure heating things, the pessary called the Golden will suit with\r\nthem, and the Enneapharmacus; but when they cannot endure heating things,\r\nthe pessaries are to be prepared from eggs, rose-oil, the fat of geese,\r\nor of domestic fowls. For inflammations attended with a greater degree of\r\nheat, melt diachylon-plaster in a double vessel with rose-oil, and add\r\nthe juice of plantain, or of endive, of succory, or of intybus. Or use\r\nthe following: Of the fresh fat of geese, or of swine, dr. iv; of the\r\ncerate of roses, or of the Susinum, oz. ij; of the yelks of roasted eggs,\r\noz. j; of saffron, dr. j; of myrrh, three oboli; of opium, two oboli; or,\r\ninstead of opium, the decoction of poppy-heads. When the pain is great,\r\ngive poppy-juice (_opium_) to the size of a lentil, with woman’s milk, or\r\nthe juice of fenugreek, as an application _per vaginam_. For inflammation\r\nwith hardness, dissolve the ointment called Tetrapharmacum in rose-oil,\r\nand introduce or inject. And when there is derangement of the position\r\nof the uterus, it is to be treated like inflammation during the violence\r\nof the attack; but, during the remissions or decline, emollients are\r\nto be applied; and when the complaint is protracted, alteratives\r\n(_metasyncritica_) are to be used. But if there is hardness externally,\r\nwe must have recourse to malagmata; that from melilots, that of Muasræus,\r\nthe Icesian, that from apples invented by Serapion, and that from wheat.\r\nThe diet at first should be light; but when the complaint begins to\r\ndecline the patient may use the bath, and take a more varied and generous\r\ndiet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Aëtius has given from Philumenus a very circumstantial\r\naccount of the symptoms and treatment of inflammation of the uterus;\r\nbut, upon the whole, it is little different from our author’s. He also\r\ngives, from Aspasia, a fuller account of displacement of the uterus.\r\nWithout doubt he alludes to retroversion and anteversion of the uterus,\r\nas they are called in modern works on midwifery. These cases generally\r\noccur in the first months of pregnancy, but there are instances of their\r\nhappening in the unimpregnated state. (See Burns’ Midwifery, i, 19.) The\r\nsymptoms, as described by Aëtius, are sufficiently well marked; retention\r\nof the fæces, owing to the rectum being obstructed by a tumour; pains in\r\nthe region of the pubes, and sometimes retention of urine. He directs\r\nus to draw off the water by means of a catheter, and to bleed, give\r\nemmenagogues, and apply pessaries according to circumstances. Avicenna\r\nand Haly Abbas make mention of displacement of the womb, but they appear\r\nto have derived all their information from Aëtius.\r\n\r\nWe shall give a brief outline of Serapion’s treatment in cases of uterine\r\ninflammation. He properly begins with bleeding first from the arm, and\r\nafterwards at the ankle. He then gives a laxative medicine, and applies a\r\nplaster to the region of the uterus. When the complaint is at its acme,\r\nhe directs us to use fomentations prepared by adding sedatives to such\r\nmedicines as pomegranate-rind, endive, fleawort, fenugreek, chamomile and\r\ndill. When the inflammation does not abate, he directs us to encourage\r\nsuppuration by the combination of maturative with calefacient medicines,\r\nsuch as a plaster containing fenugreek, barley-flour, figs, pigeon’s\r\ndung, &c. Haly’s plan of treatment is little different: General bleeding\r\naccording to circumstances; cooling draughts composed of purslain,\r\nviolets, spinage, &c.; plasters of violets, camphor, &c.; hot baths\r\nprepared with melilot, mallows, linseed, &c. When there is heat in the\r\nparts, he directs us to introduce oil of roses, with the whites of eggs,\r\nthe grease of hens, &c. to which opium may be added. When the pain is\r\nviolent, he particularly recommends cooling injections. Alsaharavius\r\nrecommends bleeding from the arm and at the ankle, diluent and cooling\r\ndraughts, local applications containing opium, seed of fenugreek,\r\nplantain, house-leek, &c. and the tepid bath.\r\n\r\nRhases says that when the womb is displaced, there is vehement pain\r\nwith distension of the parts; the woman cannot rise nor sit but with\r\ndifficulty; the urine is retained and sometimes the fæces. He directs\r\nus to restore the uterus to its position by drawing its mouth in the\r\nopposite direction. Displacement of the womb is also briefly noticed by\r\nHippocrates (de Morb. Mulier. i); by Dioscorides (Meth. Med. i, 37); and\r\nby Soranus (Ap. Phys. et Med. Min. ed. Ideler, 256.)\r\n\r\nMany of the ancient authorities describe the uterus as consisting of two\r\ncavities, separated from one another by a membrane. See, in particular,\r\nTheophilus (Comm. in Hipp. Aph. ii, 469, ed. Dietz.) Galen, however,\r\nwould appear to have been better informed (t. v, 789, ed. Kühn.) The\r\nuterus, moreover, is correctly described by Soranus (Ap. Phys. et Med.\r\nMin. 256), and by Moschion. (vi.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXV.—ON ABSCESS OF THE UTERUS.\r\n\r\nWhen the inflammation is converted into abscess, all the symptoms\r\nformerly mentioned become more intense; and, besides, there are\r\nirregular attacks accompanied with rigor, which at first are attended\r\nwith intense pain; but when suppuration has fairly taken place, there\r\nis some remission of it. About the time of the abscess’ bursting, the\r\npains, however, become more keen and seem to attack in a pungent manner;\r\nthe fevers formerly slight become more oppressive; sometimes there is\r\nobstruction of the urine, and sometimes of the fæces, occasioned by the\r\npressure of the affected part of the uterus. Sometimes there is swelling\r\nin the region of the pubes, and a sense as it were of fluctuation, when\r\nthe abscess is large. Abscess in the more exposed parts is discovered\r\nby means of the surgical instrument called dioptra, or the touch of the\r\nfinger, and from the pains being more violent, owing to the nervous\r\nnature of the mouth; as when the collection is in the fundus and vagina\r\nit is attended with less pain, and no swelling is felt heavy upon the\r\nfinger, and the mouth of the womb appears less tumid. Wherefore we\r\nmust promote suppuration by cataplasms of fenugreek, linseed, barley,\r\nor wheaten flour intermixed with boiled figs, and sometimes with\r\npigeons’ dung. Let the patient often use the hip-baths recommended for\r\ninflammation, and pessaries of turpentine, myrrh, grease of wool and\r\nbutter. When the abscess bursts, if the matter pass to the bladder, we\r\nmust give milk to drink, and draughts from the seeds of cucumber; but if\r\nit is discharged into the rectum we must throw up injections of lentils\r\nand pomegranate-rind. But if it burst into the womb, provided the pus be\r\npure, we may inject rose-oil, or whitened oil, or the ointment composed\r\nof four ingredients, which is called basilicon, or fresh butter; but if\r\na thin fetid ichor is discharged, as from a spreading ulcer, we must use\r\nan astringent injection of myrtles, dates, and dried lentils; and after\r\nthe discharge of the humours, if there he inflammation, we must persevere\r\nwith the cataplasms and hip-baths. When the aposteme is seated about the\r\nmouth of the uterus, and does not burst, after the parts which cover the\r\npus have become thin, we must endeavour to procure the evacuation of the\r\npus by a surgical operation, as will be explained in the Surgical part of\r\nthe Work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author abridges the account given by Aëtius, but has\r\nomitted some things of importance. Aëtius directs us, when the abscess\r\nis forming, to apply fomentations by introducing a piece of sponge into\r\nthe vagina, and to steam the uterus by means of a tube calculated to\r\nconvey the fumes to it. When the pain is violent, poppy-heads are to\r\nbe added to the cataplasms. The poppy is an ingredient in several of\r\nthe cataplasms mentioned by Serapion. Avicenna’s treatment is perfectly\r\nsimilar. Oribasius remarks that an abscess may burst by the os uteri,\r\nthe bladder, or into the rectum. When it makes its way into the rectum,\r\nHaly Abbas prescribes clysters composed of such articles as lentils,\r\npomegranate-flowers, Armenian earth, rose-oil, ceruse, dragon’s blood,\r\ngum arabic, the yelk of an egg, and vinegar. His general treatment\r\nconsists of pessaries, plasters, injections into the vagina, and clysters\r\nof various cooling and emollient articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXVI.—ON ULCERATION OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\nThe uterus is often ulcerated from difficult labour, extraction of the\r\nfœtus, or forced abortion, or injury of the same occasioned by acrid\r\nmedicines, or by a defluxion, or from abscesses which have burst. If,\r\ntherefore, the ulceration be within reach, it is detected by the dioptra,\r\nbut if deep-seated, by the discharges; for the fluid which is discharged\r\nvaries in its qualities. When the ulcer is inflamed, the discharge is\r\nsmall, bloody, or feculent, with great pain; but when the ulcer is foul,\r\nthe discharge is in greater quantity, and ichorous, with less pain. When\r\nthe ulcer is spreading, the discharge is fetid, black, attended with\r\ngreat pains, and other symptoms of inflammation; irritation is produced\r\nby relaxing medicines, and relief by the opposite class. When the ulcer\r\nis clean, the fluid is small in quantity, consistent, without smell,\r\nthick, white, with an agreeable sensation. When the ulcer is inflamed,\r\nwe must use those things recommended for inflammations. When it is foul,\r\nwe must inject the juice of ptisan with honey, or basilicon ointment\r\nwith the oil called Susinum; or honied water, having fenugreek, mallows,\r\nbran, or lentil without its husk, boiled in it; and in order to clean it\r\nthe more, horehound or vetches may be added; or mixing with honey the\r\nflour of vetches, or iris, or round alum, or the like, we may inject\r\nthem; and externally we may apply cataplasms of the same things mixed\r\nwith honied water. And this medicine is particularly applicable: The\r\nfinest saffron is triturated with a woman’s milk, and being added to\r\nrose-cerate with the grease of a goose, is rubbed upon flocks of wool.\r\nBut the following is a more effectual application, and one proper for\r\nviolent pains: Poppy-heads are mixed in diluted must for three days, and\r\nthen boiled until they become soft; then rose-leaves, dr. v, and saffron,\r\ndr. iij, are pounded together, and the decoction of the poppy-heads\r\nmixed with them; then wax, dr. ij, melted with rose-oil, are poured on\r\nthem, and applied on a pessary, anointing with rose-oil. The same good\r\neffects may be derived from the preparation of eggs, saffron, rose-oil,\r\nthe grease of a goose, and stag’s marrow. And the Egyptian ointment\r\nwithout the verdigris answers admirably for the cure of ulceration.\r\nWhen the ulcer is spreading and attended with inflammation, we must\r\napply a cataplasm of warm bread mixed with hydromel, oil, marshmallows,\r\nfenugreek, and fatty dates. We must inject also the juice of plantain,\r\nof nightshade, of knotgrass, and of endive, first by themselves, but\r\nafterwards with austere wine or vinegar. When the ulcer spreads and is\r\nwithout inflammation, we may inject more tonic remedies, such as the\r\ndecoction of pomegranate-rind, of roses, of olive shoots, of cypresses,\r\nof quinces, of bramble, of myrtles, of lentisk, of buckthorn, of sumach,\r\nin astringent wine, and afterwards with alum, acacia, lycium, and\r\nhypocistis. A hip-bath is also to be prepared from these decoctions. When\r\nthese things do not succeed, we must use an injection, at first of paper\r\nwith oxycrate, and then of vinegar, or of the powder called anthera, or\r\nof chalcitis, or of copperas, in the same liquids; or of the remedies for\r\ndysentery. We must allow wholesome food in small quantities. When the\r\nulcer has become clean, we must bathe more frequently, administer food\r\nfreely, and give wine, so that the body may soon recover its flesh. In\r\nplace of a pessary, we may inject the preparation from mulberries, mixed\r\nwith calamine, Cretan cistus, or plumbago. Externally we may apply the\r\nepulotic plaster to the abdomen and loins; for the powers of cataplasms,\r\nas well as those of plasters, may be thus communicated by the insensible\r\npores of the skin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author has described the treatment of ulcers in the womb\r\nso fully and judiciously, that little of importance can be added to it.\r\nIt is mostly compiled from Aëtius, who, in his turn, professes to have\r\ncopied from Archigenes, Aspasia, and Asclepiades.\r\n\r\nAretæus says that of ulcers in the womb some are broad, attended with\r\npruritus and a discharge of thick matter without fetor. These are not\r\ndangerous. But when the discharge is thin, ichorous, and fetid, when\r\nthe lips of the sore are callous, and when it spreads like a phagedenic\r\nulcer, it is of a malignant kind. His chapter on the treatment is lost.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is also a hiatus in the text of Celsus, which\r\ndetracts from the value of his account.\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus recommends a potent remedy for putrid ulcers of the\r\nuterus which supervene upon wounds. It is a trochisk formed of arsenic,\r\nquicklime, sandarach, burnt paper, and the like. Although the case\r\nrecently reported of the man who killed his wife, by introducing into her\r\nvagina the oxyd of arsenic, ought to teach us caution, we can certainly\r\nconceive that such an application, if properly managed, might prove safe\r\nand effectual. It ought also to be kept in mind that the orpiment of the\r\nancients was less virulent than the arsenic of the moderns.\r\n\r\nScarcely any additional information is to be learned from the Arabians.\r\nThe following application recommended by Avicenna seems to be a\r\njudicious one: Take equal parts of litharge, ceruse, and sarcocolla;\r\nmake a cerate with wax and rose-oil. When the ulcers are attended\r\nwith a bloody discharge, Haly Abbas directs us to use pessaries and\r\ninjections of an astringent nature, consisting of galls, hypocistis,\r\nplantain, rose-oil, and the like. When the discharge is whitish and\r\npurulent, he recommends the tepid bath and injections of barley-gruel,\r\nhoney, &c. For relieving the pain he recommends an ointment containing\r\nlitharge, frankincense, axunge, fresh butter, strained wax, and rose-oil.\r\nAlsaharavius recommends similar remedies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXVII.—ON CANCER.\r\n\r\nOf cancers in the womb, some are attended with ulceration, and some\r\nare without it. In those cases in which the part is not ulcerated, a\r\ntumour is found about the mouth of the womb, hard, unequal, callous,\r\nof a feculent colour, and red, but sometimes also somewhat livid; and\r\nthey have violent pains in the groins and abdomen, the lower part of the\r\nbelly, and the loins, which are exasperated by handling and complicated\r\napplications. When the cancer is ulcerated, in addition to the pains,\r\nhardness, and swelling there are phagedenic and unequal ulcers to be\r\nseen, which for the most part are foul, callous, white, and having ugly\r\nscabs on them; but some appear clean, some feculent, or livid, or red, or\r\nbloody. The discharge from them always is a thin ichor, watery, black,\r\nor tawny, and fetid; but blood also is sometimes discharged along with\r\nthe other symptoms of an inflamed uterus already mentioned. Wherefore\r\nthe complaint is incurable, as Hippocrates has pronounced, but may be\r\nalleviated by hip-baths from fenugreek, and mallows, and by cataplasms\r\nof a like nature. And the exacerbations of the complaint may be much\r\nalleviated by common mallows, or marshmallows, softened by boiling in\r\nhonied water, and pounded with a little rose-oil, and applied; and by\r\na cataplasm of dried figs and melilots, rue, frankincense, and navew\r\nbruised carefully with oil, and also by that from dates boiled in\r\nmust, containing also the yelks of eggs, and fine flour; or that from\r\npoppies with coriander, knotgrass, or endive. These things are to be\r\napplied during the violence of the pains; after which a cerate may be\r\napplied from rose-oil, or myrtle-oil, or the oil from the flowers\r\nof wild vines, or that of apples with dates boiled in must. But one\r\nparticularly recommended is that from the sediment found in copper\r\nvessels, which being burnt, is reduced to a powder, and mixed with the\r\ncerate of roses until it acquire the consistence of a plaster. These\r\nare the external applications. But oil applied internally is soothing\r\nto the parts. And when they become ulcerated, the milk of a woman may\r\nbe injected, and the tepid juice of plantain. But if they bleed, the\r\ninfusion of knotgrass with a little rosemary proves soothing; and so\r\nalso do pessaries medicated with saffron, women’s milk, and the juice of\r\npoppies, and the sordes of unwashed wool. But the following is one of the\r\nbest applications, and answers also for affections of the anus: Of washed\r\nItalian litharge, oz. vj; of male frankincense, of the sordes of unwashed\r\nwool, of fresh axunge, of newly-made butter, of Tuscan wax, of each, oz.\r\nij; of rose-oil, oz. iv; triturate the litharge with the juice of endive,\r\nand add to the other things when melted. Food of easy distribution and\r\nwholesome may be given, and some watery wine; avoiding acrid food and\r\nrepletion, for they are apt to be troubled with indigestion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates (de Morb. Mulier. ii, 24) gives a long account\r\nof cancer of the womb, which, when fairly formed, he pronounces to\r\nbe utterly incurable. He directs us, however, to try the effect of\r\nfumigating the womb by introducing into it a pipe attached to a pot.\r\nSteams from garlic and the fat of seals are to be applied in this manner.\r\n\r\nAëtius gives from Archigenes exactly the same account as our author.\r\n\r\nAretæus describes the ulcerated cancer, and that kind in which there is\r\nno ulceration. He calls them chronic and fatal diseases.\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas pronounces the disease to be incurable, but directs us to\r\nsoothe the sufferings of the patient by various anodyne preparations.\r\nFor this purpose he gives directions for the formation of several\r\npessaries and injections, the principal ingredients of which are\r\nlinseed, chamomile, fenugreek, coriander, beet, poppies, and the like.\r\nAlsaharavius also approves of such anodyne applications. Rhases enjoins\r\nabstinence from everything of an acrid nature, and such articles as\r\nengender black bile.\r\n\r\nWe will see the treatment of cancers in general detailed in the Fourth\r\nBook.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXVIII.—ON SCIRRHUS AND SCLEROMA.\r\n\r\nThe uterus becomes scirrhous, sometimes all at once without any\r\npreceding complaint, but most frequently after having been preceded by\r\ninflammation, which has neither been resolved nor converted into an\r\nabscess. The disease called scleroma is a species of scirrhus, most\r\nfrequently forming about the neck of the womb, and having also some\r\nswelling, but less resisting, and attended with moderate pain. These are\r\naccompanied with displacement to the opposite parts, swelling powerfully\r\nresisting in proportion to the pain, with heaviness and difficulty of\r\nmotion, not of the limbs only but of the whole body, and aversion to\r\nexertions. When not properly cured, a dropsical cachexia supervenes.\r\nIn the commencement we must have recourse to venesection, or purging\r\nwith the hiera of Archigenes; then to cataplasms of dried figs, grease\r\nof wool, nitre, or wormwood, and cupping with scarifications; and to\r\nthe soothing ointments (_malagmata_), namely the Polyarchium, that\r\nfrom seeds, and that from bay-berries; to hip-baths prepared with the\r\ndecoction of dried figs, mugwort, pennyroyal, and marshmallows; to\r\npessaries of turpentine, galbanum, myrrh, iris, and the grease of wool;\r\nto dropaces and the use of the natural baths, namely, the nitrous and\r\nbituminous. When the strength permits, a course of hellebore may also be\r\ntried.\r\n\r\n_An emollient pessary._ Of Pontic wax, of nard ointment, of each, oz.\r\niij; of the ointments of iris, that of privet, and that called Gleucinum,\r\nof each, oz. ij; of the grease of bears and geese, of butter, of the\r\nsordes of unwashed wool, of stags’ marrow, of turpentine, of each, oz.\r\nj.—_Another_: Of poley, dr. ij; of myrrh, dr. iv; having triturated with\r\nMindesian wine, and mixed it with Irinum, give to be applied.—_Another_:\r\nOf Tuscan wax, of the fat of calves, of turpentine, of stags’ marrow,\r\nof Attic honey, of old oil, equal parts. The following is an alterative\r\nwhich answers also for inflation: Of the dried white grape without its\r\nstones, oz. iij; of the leaves of the green rue, oz. ij; of sea water,\r\noz. iss; of cumin, dr. iv; of honey, q. s.; having anointed the pessary,\r\ndip it in the oil of privet, and apply. And the pessary called golden,\r\nthe Libanian, and the Enneapharmacus suit well with this affection; but\r\nthe Titian is more particularly applicable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of these diseases is taken from\r\nAëtius, who professes to copy from Soranus the Methodist. None of the\r\nother authorities has treated of them so fully. Bernard justly remarks\r\n(ap. Nonni Ep. 208) that if the ancients had not been familiar with\r\n_inspectiones cadaverum_, they could not have described the diseases\r\nof particular parts of the uterus so accurately as they have done.\r\nActuarius briefly states that scirrhus of the uterus is to be treated by\r\napplications of a digestive and emollient nature, namely, emollient oils\r\nand fats, mixed with such things as galbanum, bdellium, and the like.\r\n\r\nOf the Arabians, Avicenna is the most minute, but his treatment is\r\nborrowed from the Greeks. Haly Abbas remarks that scirrhus has a tendency\r\nto terminate in dropsy, and it is attended with sallowness, weakness,\r\nloss of appetite, amenorrhœa, swelling of the breasts and belly. His\r\nremedies are similar to those for cancer.\r\n\r\nSee an interesting account of this disease by Lodovicus Mercatus (ap.\r\nGynæcia, 951.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXIX.—ON THE MOLE.\r\n\r\nThe mole, too, is a scirrhous tumour, forming sometimes at the mouth and\r\nsometimes in the body of the womb, conveying to the touch the sensation\r\nof stone, and being attended with retraction of the parts above, and\r\nemaciation, paleness, loss of appetite, retention of the menses, and\r\nswelling of the breasts, so as in certain cases to raise suspicions at\r\nfirst of a conception; but in process of time the true nature of the\r\ncomplaint is developed. Sometimes also it raises suspicions of dropsy,\r\nfrom which it is to be distinguished by the hardness of the swelling,\r\nand from there being no sound of water when tapped by the fingers, as\r\nis the case in dropsy. In certain cases, however, the disease actually\r\nterminates in dropsy, which for the most part proves incurable. In some\r\ncases, it also brings on a discharge of blood. In general, therefore, it\r\nis proper that the patients should lie in a small, dark, and moderately\r\ncool house, upon a firm couch, with their feet raised, and in a state of\r\nquietude; for motion provokes discharges of every kind. And the swelling\r\nand hardness are to be cured by the remedies which we have mentioned\r\nfor scirrhus and scleroma of the uterus; dropsical effusions by those\r\nrecommended for dropsy; and hemorrhages by those for the flux. Some call\r\nby the name of mole an unorganized mass of flesh which forms on the coats\r\nof the womb, and is delivered like the fœtus. This species is to be\r\nmanaged by a relaxing treatment, so as to be speedily discharged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. By the first species of mole, fibrous tumour of the ovaria\r\nand perhaps also scirrhus of the neck of the womb are meant to be\r\ndescribed. The other species is now well understood, and is described\r\nby many ancient authors. See an account of it at the end of Aristotle’s\r\n‘History of Animals;’ also Pliny (H. N. vii, 15, and x, 64); Hippocrates\r\n(de Steril. xx); Plutarch (t. i, 252, ed. Xylander); Nonnus (212); Rhases\r\n(ad Mansor. ix, 88; Cont. xxii); Moschion (de Morb. Mul. 125); Actuarius\r\n(Meth. Med. i, 56.) Galen and Avicenna agree in representing the true\r\nmole as a corruption of the male semen, and consequently they believed\r\nthat it never occurs in virgins. Hanneman and other modern authorities\r\nmaintain the contrary. See ‘Dissertations on the Mole’ by Van Swieten\r\n(Comment. 1326), by Ambrose Paré (de Hom. Genit. xxxiii), by Martinus\r\nAkakia (ap. Gynæc. 773), by Lodovicus Mercatus (ap. Gynæc. 1013), by\r\nLeonardus Jacchinus (Comment. in Rhasis, ix, 71), and by Ruysch (Anat.\r\nChirurg. Cent.)\r\n\r\nAëtius gives an account of the former species, but it is little different\r\nfrom our author’s. He recommends, in the first place, emollient\r\napplications of all kinds, namely, baths, pessaries, and fumigations, and\r\nafterwards dropaces, sinapisms, and the like. The same plan of treatment\r\nis pursued by Avicenna. Haly Abbas and Alsaharavius describe the two\r\nspecies of mole in exactly the same terms as our author. Rhases also\r\ndescribes the two species of mole, namely, the one which is hard and\r\nround, and the other or soft species to which the name is now generally\r\nrestricted.\r\n\r\nHippocrates relates a curious case of a calculus which was discharged\r\nfrom the uterus of a woman sixty years old, who had long felt pain in\r\nthat region _dum venere uteretur_. Aëtius also makes mention of the\r\nuterine calculus. Lodovicus Mercatus gives a curious account of this\r\nsubject (Gynæc. 969.) Michaelis Angelus Morus relates a singular case of\r\na woman who died of uterine calculi. (Mangeti Bibl. Chirurg. xviii.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXX.—ON INFLATION OF THE UTERUS.\r\n\r\nThe uterus becomes distended with air from cold, from abortion, or\r\ndifficult parturition: its mouth being shut up, or a clot of blood\r\nbeing fastened in it. The air is sometimes contained in the cavity of\r\nthe uterus itself, and sometimes in the pores of its body. These cases\r\nare attended with swelling about the pubes and hypogastrium, with\r\nhardness, and a pungent pain, shooting as far as the diaphragm, the\r\nstomach, and the groins. When tapped with the fingers it sounds like\r\nthe swelling of tympanitis. Wherefore it is to be cured, in the first\r\nplace, by venesection, if nothing prohibits its use; and then, during\r\nthe exacerbations, by abstinence from food; by embrocations with oil of\r\nrue; by hip-baths of the decoction of rue, of pennyroyal, of mugwort,\r\nof cassia, and the like; by cataplasms from the seeds of parsley, of\r\ncumin, of fennel, of anise, of bishopsweed, and of the flower of iris;\r\nby dry cupping, and cupping with scarifications. But when the complaint\r\nis protracted, we must have recourse to purging with the hiera picra,\r\ndropaces, sinapisms, and the use of the natural baths. Let the midwife\r\nintroduce her finger well oiled, and extract gently, if possible,\r\nthe thrombus lying in the womb, by breaking it down, and then apply\r\na cataplasm of figs, of nitre, and of wormwood. Emollient epithemes\r\nshould be used, such as the Polyarchian, that from seeds, and that from\r\nbay-berries. The pessaries should consist of rue, honey, and nitre; but\r\nthe following one will be particularly applicable: Of fat figs pounded,\r\ndr. j; of cumin, dr. ij; of aphronitrum, dr. j. But, owing to its\r\nacrimony, let it be previously dipped in milk. Emollient pessaries are\r\nalso proper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This complaint is mentioned by Hippocrates (Epidem. vii),\r\nand by Galen (Meth. Med. xiv, 7, and de Causis Sympt. iii, 2.) Our\r\nauthor’s account of it is taken from Aëtius. Octavius Horatianus and\r\nNonnus direct similar applications, only the former says nothing of\r\nbleeding. Haly Abbas, in like manner, omits venesection, but recommends\r\napplications consisting mostly of carminative substances, such as\r\nparsley, birthwort, dill, rue, and fennel. They are to be used in the\r\nform of baths, fomentations, and injections. Alsaharavius recommends\r\nbleeding, anointing the womb with oil of rue, baths prepared with rue,\r\nchamomile, mace, cumin, &c. cupping-instruments applied to the pubes, and\r\nso forth. Avicenna and Rhases refer to Aëtius and Paulus, and treat of\r\nthe complaint in like manner.\r\n\r\nSee a full account of this disease by Lodovicus Mercatus (ap. Gynæc. 944.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXI.—ON UTERINE SUFFOCATION, OR THE HYSTERICAL CONVULSION.\r\n\r\nUterine suffocation is a rising up of the uterus, affecting\r\nsympathetically the most important parts, as the carotid arteries, the\r\nheart, and the membranes of the brain. The patients experience, when the\r\nattack is at hand, languor of mind, fear, atony of the limbs, paleness\r\nof the countenance, and sadness of the eyes; and when the suffocation\r\ncomes on there is deep sleep, mental aberration, loss of the senses\r\nand of speech, with contraction of the limbs; the cheeks then begin to\r\nredden, and the countenance becomes turgid; but when the attack is going\r\noff, some moisture is to be felt about the genital organs; and rumbling\r\nof wind in the intestines precedes the remission. The uterus is then\r\ngradually relaxed, and thus they recover their understanding and senses.\r\nThe disease comes on periodically like epilepsy, and is occasioned by the\r\nuterus being gorged, or from semen or some other matter having become\r\nputrid in it. Of those attacked with it the greater number speedily\r\nrecover, but some die suddenly during the paroxysms, their pulse becoming\r\ndense and palpitating irregularly, and then asphyxia taking place; a\r\nlittle perspiration bedewing the surface of the body; and the respiration\r\nbeing at first feeble but afterwards becoming completely stopped. This\r\naffection attacks most frequently in winter and autumn, especially\r\nyoung women who are prone to venery, the barren particularly, if their\r\nsterility be brought on by medicines, and others of a cold nature.\r\nDuring the paroxysms, therefore, ligatures are to be applied around the\r\nextremities, and the limbs and whole body rubbed as for the recovery of\r\npersons in deliquium animi. Things of a strongly fetid smell are to be\r\napplied to the nose, such as an extinguished lamp, castor, liquid pitch,\r\ngum vernix, burnt wool and rags. Some have even brought close to the nose\r\na chamber-pot containing stale urine or fæces. It answers well to apply\r\na cupping-instrument to the groins and hypogastrium, with great heat,\r\neither performing dry cupping or cupping with scarifications. When the\r\ncomplaint is protracted, carminatives will prove useful, such as collyria\r\nintroduced into the anus, or cumin and nitre with honey. Hardened fæces\r\nmay also be discharged from the bowels by means of clysters, lest by\r\ntheir presence they occasion pressure; and, in order to draw back the\r\nuterus to its situation, fragrant ointments are to be injected into the\r\nparts, such as those of marjoram and Indian leaf. Mustard may be applied\r\nto the nose and likewise to the feet, in the form of a cataplasm. One\r\nshould call aloud to them in a shrill tone of voice, and rouse them\r\nthereby; and sternutatories of castor, fuller’s herb, and pepper may be\r\napplied. When the paroxysm remits we may compel them to vomit, and keep\r\nthem from food altogether or allow them but little. After the seventh\r\nday we must purge them with the hiera from colocynth. After the third,\r\nwe must apply cupping-instruments to the loins and flanks, and then we\r\nmay give a draught of castor, sometimes in a decoction of mugwort and\r\nsometimes in honied water; for in some cases this alone is sufficient for\r\na complete cure. But hip-baths and emollient pessaries are also to be\r\napplied. Such is the treatment for the paroxysms; but for the recovery\r\nof the general system, we begin with venesection and proceed to purging\r\nwith hiera, and then give the medicine called picra from aloes to the\r\namount of dr. j, with three cupfuls of honied water in succession, or dr.\r\nij with six cupfuls at intervals. Dropaces, cupping, and sinapisms must\r\nalso be used, and the acopa from euphorbium; then exercises, friction,\r\nvociferation, and, last of all, the use of the natural baths.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Hippocrates (de Nat. Muliebri); Galen (sec. loc. ix,\r\nde Loc. Affect. vi, 5); Aretæus (Morb. Acut. ii, 11); Celsus (iv, 20);\r\nMoschion (de Morb. Mul. 129); Eros (ap.

It accords not well with modern ideas upon the subject; and\r\nprovided it be admitted as a fact that men are sometimes, though rarely,\r\nseized with hysterical convulsions, there can be no doubt but the ancient\r\nhypothesis must at once fall to the ground. Perhaps a stickler for the\r\nancient doctrine, while he admitted with Aretæus that men are subject\r\nto complaints resembling hysterics, might hold with a late intelligent\r\nwriter, Mr. Tait, that men are never affected with the real hysterical\r\nconvulsion.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hippocrates, this complaint most frequently attacks\r\nantiquated virgins or young widows. If the womb, he says, ascend to the\r\nliver, the patient suddenly becomes speechless, her teeth are fixed, and\r\nher colour becomes pale. His treatment consists of applying a tight swath\r\nround the middle, giving fragrant wine, applying fetid things to the\r\nnose, and fragrant things to the uterus. The belly is to be purged, and\r\ncastor and fleawort given internally. Herodotus, the historian, mentions\r\nthat the ancient Scythians used castor for the cure of complaints of the\r\nuterus. (iv.)\r\n\r\nGalen is at great pains to explain how the uterus is retracted upwards\r\nand to the sides by its ligaments, but his explanation is too long for\r\nour limits, and therefore we must content ourselves with referring the\r\ncurious reader to it. (De Loc. Affect. u. s.) He says, in another place,\r\nthat when uterine suffocation takes place, there is loss of sense and of\r\nmotion, a small feeble pulse, and sometimes asphyxy. He recommends agaric\r\nand plantain in wine; smelling to bitumen, castor, liquid pitch, cedar\r\nrosin, &c.; fumigating the parts with hartshorn, and applying to them rue\r\nand honey upon wool.\r\n\r\nCelsus thus marks the distinction between the epileptic and hysterical\r\nconvulsion: “Interdum etiam sic exanimat ut tanquam comitiali morbo\r\nprosternat. Distat tamen hic casus, eo quod neque oculi vertuntur, nec\r\nspumæ profluunt, nec nervi distenduntur; sopor tantum est.” If the\r\nstrength permit, he approves of venesection, or of cupping the groins\r\nwithout scarifications; then fetid things are to be applied to the nose,\r\nand fragrant things to the uterus, the whole body is to be rubbed,\r\nsinapisms are to be put to the lower part of the belly, and castor, gith,\r\nand dill given internally.\r\n\r\nAretæus surpasses every other ancient author in his description of this\r\naffection. He sets out with pronouncing the uterus to be, as it were,\r\nan animal within an animal, wandering upwards, downwards, and to either\r\nside, being attracted by fragrant things and flying from fetid. When,\r\ntherefore, it ascends upwards, it occasions compression of the liver,\r\ndiaphragm, lungs, or heart, and sympathetically with the last, also of\r\nthe carotids. It is accompanied with heaviness of the head and loss\r\nof sensibility. Nearly allied to it, but yet a different affection,\r\nis a complaint which attacks men, having therefore no connexion with\r\nthe uterus, and not being relieved by fetid things. He says that, when\r\nthe attack proves fatal, the pulse sinks and becomes irregular and\r\nintermittent, there is a strong sense of suffocation, loss of speech,\r\nloss of sensibility, respiration unequal or not even perceptible, sudden\r\nand unexpected death. For some time after the countenance does not put\r\non the appearance of death, but is redder than natural, and the eyes\r\nproject. He also gives a good account of the treatment, which, however,\r\ncannot be said to differ in any material respect from that of Galen and\r\nCelsus, as explained above. The same may be said of Oribasius, Nonnus,\r\nand Octavius.\r\n\r\nAëtius is very minute in his description. He remarks that after\r\nrespiration by the mouth is stopped, the arteries may continue to\r\nbeat, as is the case with reptiles in winter. The disease, he says, is\r\noccasioned by a flatulent refrigeration, and not by inflammation, as\r\nSoranus has said.\r\n\r\nActuarius accounts for the complaint and describes it in the same terms\r\nas the preceding writers. As it occurs principally with virgins and\r\nwidows, he prescribes for them the Hudibrastic mode of wooing widows!\r\n\r\nEros gives the same account of the symptoms and treatment as the others.\r\n\r\nMoschion, however, disapproves entirely of the common practice of\r\napplying fetid things to the nose, ligatures to the extremities, and\r\nfragrant pessaries to the uterus. On the contrary, he recommends warm\r\nfomentations, injections of warm water thrown into the uterus, rubbing\r\nthe body with warm hands, and when the disease gets into the chronic\r\nstate, giving alteratives (metasyncritica) and hellebore.\r\n\r\nAccording to Leo, men who have been long restricted from venery are\r\nsubject to the hysterical convulsion.\r\n\r\nSee, in Alexander Aphrodisiensis, an ingenious explanation why fetid\r\nsubstances applied to the nose and fragrant ones to the parts below\r\nwere supposed to prove beneficial in such cases. It is too long for our\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe account which Plato gives of the nature of the uterus and the\r\nphenomena of hysterics ought perhaps not to be taken in too literal\r\na sense, considering that philosopher’s well-known propensity to\r\nmystification. He says, that part in women which is called the womb\r\nbeing an animal desirous of generation, if it become unfruitful for a\r\nlong time, turns indignant, and, wandering all over the body, stops the\r\npassages of the spirits and the respiration, and occasions the most\r\nextreme anxiety and all sorts of diseases. (Timæus.)\r\n\r\nThe Arabians describe and treat the complaint exactly like our author.\r\nSerapion says that the uterus is delighted with fragrant things, and\r\nflies from fetid, not because it is an animal but from a natural\r\nproperty. He recommends ligatures to the extremities, purging with\r\nhiera picra, bleeding if not contra-indicated, the application of fetid\r\nthings to the nose, and of fragrant things to the uterus, and so forth.\r\nAvicenna states that the affection arises from the menstrual discharge or\r\nsemen being retained in the uterus. Haly Abbas adopts this explanation.\r\nHe says the uterus affects the brain and heart sympathetically, giving\r\nrise to apoplexy, epilepsy, and other serious complaints. Young women,\r\nespecially widows, are most liable to it. He says it is often periodical\r\nlike epilepsy. His treatment consists of ligatures to the extremities,\r\nwith friction, sprinkling rose-water on the face, applying fetid things\r\nto the nose, and the other means used in cases of suspended animation.\r\nAt the same time he directs us to apply fragrant things to the parts\r\nof generation, and dry cupping to the hypogastric region. This is the\r\ntreatment during a fit. To remove the tendency to the affection he\r\nrecommends the warm bath medicated with wormwood, bay-leaves, marjoram,\r\n&c. fetid pills, hiera picra, and the like; and when connected with\r\nsuppression of the menstrual discharge, he directs bleeding at the ankle,\r\nor even at the arm, if there be fulness and redness of the face. If the\r\nwoman is unmarried, he recommends a change of life. Alsaharavius states\r\nthat there is this difference between the hysterical and the epileptic\r\nconvulsion, that in the former the woman does not lose her senses nor\r\nemit foam at the mouth. Like Haly, he directs us to bleed at the ankle\r\nwhen the menses are obstructed, to apply cupping-instruments to the\r\nthighs and hypogastric region, and to take diuretics and emmenagogues.\r\nThere is nothing peculiarly interesting in Rhases, as his account of the\r\ndisease is collected from preceding authors. One of them seems to say\r\nthat the ascension of the uterus is not real but apparent. He remarks\r\nthat affections of the uterus are attended with pain of the occiput.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXII.—ON PROLAPSUS UTERI.\r\n\r\nProlapsus of the uterus takes place rarely indeed, but from a variety\r\nof causes; for it is occasioned either by a woman’s falling from a\r\nheight and pitching upon her bottom, whereby the ligaments are ruptured\r\nwhich keep the viscus in its position; or by the tearing away of the\r\nsecundines, which drag the uterus along with them when they adhere,\r\nas in difficult labour; or by the awkward performance of embryotomy;\r\nor by a blow, or mental emotions, such as when the loss of children\r\nhas been communicated, or an irruption of the enemy, or by a dangerous\r\nvoyage, or some such cause, by which the uterus has fallen down, owing\r\nto a relaxation of the whole system, or owing to paralysis and atony\r\nof the parts, which happens most especially to those in the decline of\r\nhealth. It is towards its mouth that it falls down. Some, indeed, have\r\nrelated that the whole uterus has been prolapsed, which is incredible;\r\nfor how could it have been reduced and fixed in its place? Wherefore, we\r\nmust first evacuate the hardened fæces by a clyster and bring about a\r\ndischarge of the urine, in order that the uterus may be freed from all\r\ncompression, and then place the patient in a supine position, having her\r\nbottom elevated, her thighs bent, and her legs separated; and then take a\r\nhasp of wool, in figure and thickness resembling the female vagina, and\r\nthis being bound round with a slender piece of cloth, and dipped in the\r\njuice of acacia, or of hypocistis dissolved in wine, is to be applied to\r\nthe uterus, and all the projecting part pushed upwards gently, until the\r\nwhole swelling is restored to the vagina; after which the pubes is to be\r\ncovered externally with a piece of sponge squeezed out of oxycrate; and\r\nthe woman is to be laid with her legs stretched out and applied so that\r\nthe one may lie over the other. After this, cupping-instruments with much\r\nheat are to be fixed to the navel and the loins on both sides, and things\r\nof a fragrant smell applied. On the third day, while the wool is still\r\nremaining in the vagina, let the woman sit in a hip-bath of dark-coloured\r\naustere wine slightly warmed, or in a decoction of myrtle, lentisk, and\r\npomegranate-rind. After these things, let the wool be taken away and\r\nanother fold applied soaked in the medicine. Cataplasms are to be applied\r\nexternally to the hypogastrium, of dates, polenta, or dried lentils, and\r\npomegranate-rind with oxymel. And every third day let the same thing be\r\ndone until the cure be completed. But if the prolapsed part cannot be\r\nreduced, and mortify in the course of time, we may take it away without\r\napprehending any danger: for they relate that the whole uterus, having\r\nbecome mortified, has been taken away, and yet the woman lived.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This complaint is particularly well treated of by the Father\r\nof Medicine. He has even described the case of a complete procidentia,\r\nwhen, he says, the uterus hangs down like a scrotum. Hippocrates directs\r\nus to make cold applications to the pudenda; to wash the part with an\r\nastringent lotion, and restore it to its place. He afterwards gives\r\ndirections to make the woman lie upon her back with her legs crossed and\r\ntied together; and if the disease be likely to return, he recommends\r\ncupping and pitching of the hypogastrium.\r\n\r\nCelsus mentions prolapsus, and recommends for it hip-baths of salt or\r\nastringent water, and local applications of a styptic nature after the\r\nwomb has been replaced.\r\n\r\nAretæus, with his usual talent for description, draws a melancholy\r\npicture of a woman labouring under a complete procidentia uteri. He says\r\nit is occasioned by abortions, violent concussion, or severe labour; and\r\nexplains very well how this happens from relaxation or rupture of the\r\nligaments of the uterus.\r\n\r\nOur author takes his account almost word for word from Aëtius, who\r\nacknowledges his obligations to Soranus.\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius recommends nearly the same plan of treatment as Hippocrates;\r\nand directs us, when the attempts at reduction fail, to extirpate the\r\nwomb by an operation. Avenzoar relates a case in which he saw the whole\r\nuterus projecting externally. He did not know the issue, only he was\r\nsure that the disease subsisted for a considerable time. He also relates\r\nanother case upon the authority of a friend of undoubted veracity. Haly\r\nAbbas likewise mentions that the uterus sometimes protrudes fairly out,\r\nand enumerates the same causes of the complaint as our author. He relates\r\nthat cases have occurred of the whole uterus having become putrid and\r\nbeen removed entire. Rhases, Avicenna, and Serapion, appear to have\r\nderived all their information from Aëtius and Paulus. Rhases directs us\r\nto bathe the parts with styptic decoctions, to put the woman into a bath\r\nmedicated with roses, myrrh, &c., to reduce the womb, and retain it with\r\ncompresses soaked in an astringent solution.\r\n\r\nEros recommends baths composed of the decoctions of acorns,\r\npomegranate-rind, sumach, galls, &c.; also astringent fomentations, and a\r\ncooling diet.\r\n\r\nThe ancients appear not to have used pessaries made of solid materials,\r\nsuch as wood and metals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXIII.—ON PHIMUS IN THE UTERUS.\r\n\r\nPhimus takes place about the mouth of the womb, either in consequence of\r\nulceration or of inflammation terminating in scirrhus. We must cure it by\r\nemollient hip-baths of oil and water, and of the decoction of fenugreek,\r\napplying cataplasms of a like kind, and introducing emollient pessaries.\r\nBut if the complaint be protracted, we must have recourse to vapour-baths\r\nand fumigation with aromatics. The phimus may be dissolved by a pessary\r\nof the sordes of unwashed wool, nitre, and turpentine-rosin, being simply\r\nan obstruction of the mouth of the womb.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Imperforate hymen and other obstructions of the vagina\r\nrequiring a surgical operation will be treated of in the Sixth Book.\r\nThe case here treated of is simply an obstruction of the os uteri by a\r\ncallous substance. The emollient treatment by pessaries here recommended\r\nappears very proper. Aëtius makes mention of a more efficacious but\r\ndangerous application, namely, a piece of sponge spread with an ointment\r\ncontaining arsenic, alum, &c. Hippocrates had recommended an application\r\ncontaining verdegris. (De Steril. xii.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna treats the complaint solely by a surgical operation.\r\nAlsaharavius approves of the emollient treatment, such as decoctions of\r\nmallows, fenugreek, linseed, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXIV.—THE CURE OF STERILITY.\r\n\r\nIt is a common direction, applicable both to the man and the woman, to\r\npreserve the whole body in a proper temperament, by exercise, food,\r\nbaths, and everything else in moderation. What is most especially to be\r\nattended to is, not to allow them to get into a fat habit of body; for\r\nfat persons are unfit for the propagation of children, owing to the want\r\nof agreement in their genital organs, and because they do not emit much\r\nsemen. Nor are those who are much emaciated more so. All things which\r\nare heating and moderately flatulent assist, such as taking heating\r\nwine in moderation; and of pot-herbs, the rocket, clary (_horminum_),\r\nhedge-mustard, and the like; but they must, by all means, abstain from\r\ncalamint and rue. When conception will not take place, owing to some\r\ncacochymy, we must purge it away, or dilute it by a proper diet. But\r\nwomen must attend particularly to the state of the uterus, and that the\r\nmenstrual evacuation be not obstructed. When, therefore, the monthly\r\npurgation is near, the woman must attend particularly to take food\r\nand drink in moderation, and also some of those things which promote\r\nthe discharge, such as the fragrant and acrid pot-herbs, as scandix,\r\nsamphire, fennel, parsley, and alsander. And the intemperaments of the\r\nwomb must be rectified. Wherefore the cold intemperaments of the uterus\r\nare indicated by retention of the menses, a cold and incrassating diet,\r\nand some torpor about the pubes, loins, and legs; and these persons, if\r\nthey become perfectly congealed in habit, have no venereal desires at\r\nall. Wherefore we must endeavour, in every other way, but particularly by\r\nall kinds of fomentations, and by fumigation with aromatics, to recall\r\nthe natural heat. And it will not be at all improper to drink of castor\r\nand of some of the aromatic seeds, such as cumin, anise, the flowers of\r\npennyroyal, and the fruit of junipers, mixing some pepper with each.\r\nFumigations of the womb may be applied either by sitting on a proper\r\nchair, and receiving the vapours which arise, or by injections of hot\r\nwater in which sage, mugwort, rue, cumin, pennyroyal, sweet flag, and\r\nthe aromatic seeds have been boiled. A cataplasm of any of them may also\r\nbe applied to the lower part of the belly. The epitheme of Polyarchus is\r\nalso appropriate. Frictions of the lower part of the belly and nates are\r\nno less proper. The woman may also use pessaries of myrrh, rue, galbanum,\r\nand castor, having previously fomented with honied water or salt water.\r\nThe pessary called Goné is also an excellent one. Warmer intemperaments\r\nof the uterus are indicated by the whole body being hotter than usual,\r\nby the menses being voided in small quantity and with pain, and by the\r\nprivy parts of the woman being ulcerated. They are to be remedied by such\r\nthings as are moderately moistening and cooling, such as the pot-herbs,\r\nlettuces, mallows, blite, gourd, cucumber, pompion, orach, and purslain,\r\nand by the other articles of food of a like nature; and we must apply to\r\nthe bladder, abdomen and loins, all cooling things, such as cataplasms\r\nand liniments made of the juices of herbs. If the woman cannot conceive\r\nowing to humidity of the uterus, it is indicated by there being much\r\nmoisture of the parts during the venereal act, and by the menses being\r\nthin and in great quantity. A desiccative diet, therefore, suits with\r\nthese cases; also exercises and frictions of the upper parts; emetics\r\nand dry food in moderate quantities. It will likewise answer well to\r\nstrengthen the uterus by austere medicines, such as the decoction\r\nof lentisk, of myrtles, of roses, and of sumach; or also by that of\r\npomegranate flowers, of the tender shoots of bramble, and of galls.\r\nWhen the uterus is drier than common, it is to be cured by the opposite\r\nremedies, I mean by baths and unguents, a moistening diet of pot-herbs,\r\nwine in moderation, and that not very old. But if conception be prevented\r\nby thick humours, and if they be of a pungent nature, the woman must be\r\npurged in a way suitable to each humour, and more particularly with the\r\npicra from aloes; then an injection with the whey of women’s milk is to\r\nbe administered, and a more suitable diet thought of. Pituitous humours\r\nare to be evacuated by exercise, sudorifics and emetics, or downwards by\r\nthe bowels. The following medicine may be given: Of dodder of thyme, of\r\neuphorbium, of pepper, of carrot-seed, of the seed of Macedonian parsley,\r\nequal parts; triturate all together, and give to the amount of two\r\ndrachms to drink. This purges well and heats the womb, so that it often\r\nmakes the menses flow in cases where this discharge was stopped. As soon\r\nas this correction has become apparent, and the menses flow properly,\r\nthen one must enjoy the woman as soon as the menstrual evacuation stops.\r\nWhen flatus in the womb prevents conception, the symptoms of which may be\r\nrecognized from what we have said on inflation of the uterus, it is to be\r\ncured first by a spare diet, and administering cumin, dill, parsley-seed,\r\nand that of rue and anise; and by giving many of the aromatics, some to\r\ndrink and others by pessaries. When the mouth of the uterus is shut up,\r\nit must be opened by injections of aromatics, and by using fomentations\r\nfrom mallows, linseed, fenugreek and oil, and sometimes of honey; or, by\r\nthe stronger ones, composed of mugwort, fleabane, calamint, pennyroyal\r\nand chamomile. In addition to these we may use turpentine, nitre, wild\r\ncucumber, elaterium, cassia, and tar-water. When the mouth of the womb\r\ngapes, the diet, fomentations and medicines should be of a desiccant\r\nnature and astringent; and the flowers of pomegranates, lentisk, the\r\nroots of brambles, myrtle-berries, and those things applicable for a\r\nhumid intemperament. Distortions of the uterus are to be rectified\r\nby fomentations and emollient pessaries. In such cases, coition _a\r\nposteriori_ would seem to promote conception.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates, in his ingenious work on Sterility, assigns the\r\nfollowing causes for a woman’s not conceiving: First, because the os\r\nuteri is turned obliquely from the passage to it. Second, because the\r\ninside of the uterus being too smooth, either naturally or in consequence\r\nof the cicatrices of ulcers, it will not retain the semen. Third, when,\r\nowing to suppression of the menses, any obstruction takes place about the\r\nos uteri, it is apt to prevent impregnation. Fourth, when menstruation\r\ndoes not take place, the veins of the uterus become so gorged with blood\r\nthat they do not retain the semen; or, on the contrary, the same effect\r\nmay arise from profuse menstruation whereby the retentive faculty of the\r\nvessels is weakened; or a return of the menstrual fluid in too great\r\nquantity may wash away the semen. Fifth, prolapsus uteri, by rendering\r\nthe mouth of the womb hard and callous, prevents impregnation. The\r\ntreatment is delivered at so great length that we cannot venture even to\r\ngive an abridgment of it.\r\n\r\nAëtius treats very fully of sterility, but his views are much the same as\r\nour author’s. See also Oribasius (Synops. ix, 45.)\r\n\r\nIn cases of sterility, Octavius Horatianus directs us to ascertain\r\nwhether the os uteri be turned aside or shut up. He delivers the\r\ntreatment of these cases with singular minuteness. His principal remedies\r\nare pessaries, which of course are composed of various ingredients. We\r\nshall give the composition of one of the simplest of them in his own\r\nwords: “Nullo etenim remedio meliore et magis innoxio, aut corrigi matrix\r\npoterit, aut purgari, quam usus nitri suppositione.” That is to say, a\r\nsuppository of soda is one of the safest and most effectual remedies.\r\n\r\nSerapion, like Aëtius and Paulus, regulates his treatment entirely upon\r\nthe principle of correcting the intemperaments, which he considers as\r\nthe most common causes of sterility. A humid intemperament, he says,\r\noccasions sterility in the same manner that wet ground proves injurious\r\nto seed which is sown upon it; and a hot intemperament dries up the semen\r\nas the earth scorches the seed during the heat of the dog-days. Such\r\nbeing his ideas of the causes of sterility, one can readily comprehend\r\nhis principles of treatment. Avicenna, Rhases, and Avenzoar likewise\r\ndirect their attention to the correction of the intemperaments, but\r\nalso recommend attention to any other local complaint about the genital\r\norgans. Haly Abbas, among other remedies, directs us to correct the state\r\nof the uterus by means of stimulant fumigations. One of his prescriptions\r\ncontain arsenic. This would prove a potent but dangerous application.\r\nAlsaharavius expresses his distrust in the virtues of many specifics\r\nwhich had long retained celebrity for the cure of sterility. Like the\r\nothers, he directs us to find out the cause of it, and remove it if\r\npossible by suitable remedies.\r\n\r\nPlutarch thus enumerates the causes which had been supposed to explain\r\nwhy a woman does not conceive after every act of coition. Diocles,\r\nthe physician, maintained that it is either because no semen has been\r\nemitted, or less than necessary; or because it does not contain the\r\nprolific principle; or from a deficiency of heat, coldness, moisture,\r\nor dryness; or from relaxation of the uterus. The Stoics held that it\r\nis from the obliquity of the penis, so that it does not project the\r\nsemen straight forward; or from the disproportion between the genital\r\nmembers. Erasistratus taught that it is occasioned by callosities and\r\nfleshy excrescences; or from the uterus being more spongy or smaller than\r\nnatural. (De Placit. Philos. v, 9.) The causes of barrenness are fully\r\nand ingeniously treated of in the tenth book of Aristotle’s ‘History of\r\nAnimals,’ which, however, is of very doubtful authenticity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXV.—ON FISSURES, CONDYLOMATA, AND HEMORRHOIDS OF THE UTERUS.\r\n\r\nFissures occur about the mouth of the uterus from difficult parturition,\r\nand at first they escape notice while the pains from the labour are\r\nrecent; but afterwards they are slightly felt, either upon manual\r\ninspection or during coition, when they bleed, owing to the friction.\r\nThey are also discovered when the vagina is distended, for ruptures\r\nin the circle of the mouth are perceived. In these cases all surgical\r\naid, and medicines of an irritating nature, must be avoided, and\r\nrecourse had to the simpler hip-baths and pessaries. The medicine called\r\nTetrapharmacon diluted is befitting. But if it be callous, we must use\r\nthat from paper, with rose-oil. If they cannot bear the strength of\r\nit, mix Illyrian iris with turpentine, and apply it. When the ulcers\r\nare cicatrized, it will be proper to use the medicine from cadmia, or\r\nsome of the applications to the anus, such as that from litharge. It\r\nsometimes happens that these fissures, becoming chronic, are converted\r\ninto condylomata, in which case the callus is to be removed by similar\r\nremedies, and the condylomata cicatrized. Hemorrhoids form about the\r\nmouth and neck of the uterus, which will be discovered by the speculum;\r\nfor eminences may be detected which, during the exacerbations, are\r\npainful, bloody, and red, but, during the remissions, are wrinkled,\r\nfree from pain, somewhat livid, and emit a slight discharge. If\r\npossible, therefore, in these cases, one must seize upon them during the\r\nremissions with a forceps and cut them out; or if not, we may touch them\r\nwith astringent medicines, sometimes applying dried pomegranate-rind\r\nwith galls, or something such; and sometimes using those recommended\r\nfor hemorrhages of the uterus, which will apply both for fluxes and\r\nhemorrhoids. These are recognized by the uterus discharging blood\r\nconstantly, or if at intervals, not in the menstrual period.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This section is mostly compiled from Aëtius (xvi, 97,\r\n107.) The astringent applications recommended by Aëtius contain alum,\r\npomegranate-rind, ceruse, litharge, burnt lead, hypocistis, &c. For\r\ncondylomata, the Pseudo-Dioscorides recommends an application containing\r\narsenic. (Euporist. ii, 218.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna and Rhases give a similar account of these complaints. They\r\ndirect us to apply to hemorrhoids either such astringents as those\r\ndirected above, or to remove them by a ligature. Haly forbids caustic\r\nmedicines, as they may prove injurious to the uterus; and prefers\r\nextirpating them by a surgical operation. For fissures he directs us\r\nto use basilicon, with the fat of a duck or hen, and oil of violets,\r\nalong with pitching and cataplasms. Alsaharavius directs us to extirpate\r\nhemorrhoids by an operation; and when the basilicon ointment does not\r\nsucceed with the condylomata, to treat them similarly. As the ancients\r\nhave not described polypus uteri by name, we are inclined to think that\r\nthey must have comprehended it and all the other tumours about the uterus\r\nunder the general appellation of hemorrhoids.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXVI.—ON DIFFICULT LABOUR.\r\n\r\nDifficult labour arises either from the woman who bears the child, or\r\nfrom the child itself, or from the secundines, or from some external\r\ncircumstances. From the woman in labour, either because she is gross and\r\nfat, or because her whole womb is small, or because she has no pains,\r\nor is affected with fear, or because the uterus or some other part is\r\ninflamed or otherwise diseased, or because, from some natural weakness,\r\nshe is unable to expel the fœtus, or because the labour is premature.\r\nFrom the child, either because it is too large; or small, and of little\r\nweight; or from its having a hydrocephalous head; or from being a\r\nmonster, such as having two heads; or because it is dead; or, although\r\nalive, because it is weak and unable to advance outwards; or because\r\nthere happens to be several children, as Herophilus relates a case of\r\nfive; or because the position is preternatural. For the natural position\r\nof the child is, first, when its head presents with the hands bent upon\r\nthe thighs, and having its head directly applied to the mouth of the\r\nwomb; and next to that, when it descends by the feet, and there is no\r\nturning aside. All the other positions except these are preternatural.\r\nOr from the secundines, either because the membranes cannot be torn,\r\nowing to their thickness; or because they have been torn prematurely,\r\nowing to their thinness; for when the waters are evacuated unseasonably,\r\nthe fœtus gets out with difficulty, from the dryness of the parts. From\r\nexternal circumstances, either from cold contracting or immoderate heat\r\ndissipating the powers, or from some accidental occurrence. Wherefore,\r\nif the difficulty of parturition arise from constriction, and, as\r\nit were, impaction of the fœtus, we must first endeavour to produce\r\nrelaxation by injecting frequently hot sweet-oil with the decoction of\r\nfenugreek, of mallows, of linseed, or with eggs, as a paregoric. Then\r\nwe must apply cataplasms to the pubes, abdomen, and loins, of linseed,\r\nor of honied water, or of oil and water; and use hip-baths of a similar\r\nnature. We must also avail ourselves of the relaxation produced by baths,\r\nif neither fever nor any other cause prohibit; and the woman is to be\r\nmoved on a couch in a moderately warm air. Some have had recourse to\r\npowerful shaking, and have applied sternutatories. If the woman be in\r\nlow spirits, she is to be encouraged; and if she is inexperienced in\r\nlabour, she is to be directed to keep in her breath strongly, and to\r\npress down to the flanks. If she be in a swoon, she is to be resuscitated\r\nby such strong-smelling things as are not stimulant; and when moderately\r\nrecovered, she is to be supported with a little food. A woman that is\r\nfat is to be placed in bed in a prone position, bending her knees upon\r\nher thighs, in order that the womb, being carried to the abdomen, may\r\npresent with its mouth direct. By means of the fingers the mouth is to\r\nbe smeared with cerates or fatty substances, and gently dilated. And\r\nif there be any complaint in the parts, it must be previously attended\r\nto; and hardened fæces when retained must be expelled by an emollient\r\nclyster. The membranes may be divided either by the fingers, or by a\r\nscalpel concealed within them, the left hand directing it. And some of\r\nthe fatty liquids may be thrown up into the uterus by a syringe. When\r\nthe fœtus is in a preternatural position, we may restore the natural\r\nposition, by sometimes pressing it back, sometimes drawing it down,\r\nsometimes pushing it aside, and sometimes rectifying the whole. If a\r\nhand or foot protrude, we must not seize upon the limb and drag it down,\r\nfor thereby it will be the more wedged in, or may be dislocated, or\r\nfractured; but fixing the fingers about the shoulders or hip-joint of\r\nthe fœtus, the part that had protruded is to be restored to its proper\r\nposition. If there be a wrong position of the whole fœtus, attended with\r\nimpaction, we must first push it upwards from the mouth of the womb,\r\nthen lay hold of it, and direct it properly to the mouth of the uterus.\r\nIf more than one child have descended, they are to be raised upwards\r\nagain, and then brought downwards. Everything is to be done gently, and\r\nwithout pressure, the parts being smeared with oil. The time for placing\r\nthe woman on the stool is when the mouth of the womb is open and meets\r\nthe finger, and when rupture of the membranes is at hand. If, owing to\r\nthe death of the child, or any other cause, it do not advance, we must\r\nproceed to embryotomy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates has treated fully of Difficult Parturition in\r\nthe first book of his treatise ‘de Morbis Mulierum,’ from which we shall\r\nselect a few remarks to give the reader some idea of his practice in\r\nthese cases. When the child presents doubled at the mouth of the womb he\r\ndirects us to push it upwards, and rectify the position so that the head\r\nmay come down. When a hand or foot of a living child protrudes, it is\r\nto be pushed up in like manner, and the head made to present. When the\r\nleg or arm of a dead child protrudes, it is best, he says, to proceed in\r\nthe same manner if possible; but otherwise they are to be amputated at a\r\njoint and the head opened. The process of opening the head is minutely\r\ndescribed by him. He advises us likewise to open the chest when any\r\ndifficulty of delivering it is experienced. When in feet presentations\r\nthe head is retained after the body is delivered, he advises us to\r\nintroduce a hand between the os uteri and the head and deliver it. When\r\nthe secundines are retained, he orders us to extract them slowly, and for\r\nthis purpose directs that the woman being placed on a stool, the child\r\nnot having been separated is to be allowed to hang down, so that by its\r\nweight it may produce separation; and, lest its weight should occasion\r\ntoo strong pulling, he advises it to be laid on wool, or bladders filled\r\nwith water, which being perforated, the child shall sink down gradually\r\nand draw away the placenta. We shall have occasion to treat of this\r\npractice further in the Sixth Book.\r\n\r\nAristotle states that delivery takes place naturally by the head, but\r\nsometimes preternaturally by the feet. (H. A. vii, 7.)\r\n\r\nCelsus directs us when the child is dead, to introduce the hand, finger\r\nby finger, into the womb, and examine the presentation, which will be the\r\nhead, the feet, or the body laid transverse. He states that the object of\r\nthe operator is to bring down the body either by the head or the feet.\r\nWhen the arm presents, he directs us to bring down the head, which is to\r\nbe seized by means of a hook fixed in the eye, ear, mouth, or forehead,\r\nand cautiously pulled along; and in doing this he properly directs us to\r\npull with one hand and keep the other fixed at the instrument. When the\r\nfeet present, they are to be brought down and delivery accomplished in\r\nthis way. When the child lies across, he recommends us, if the position\r\ncannot be got rectified, to fix the hook in one of the armpits and pull\r\nit down; but if other means fail, he directs us to divide the body at the\r\nneck and extract the parts separately. In extracting the secundines, he\r\nproperly directs us to stretch the cord gently with the left hand, and\r\nintroducing the right into the uterus, to separate the placenta from the\r\nwomb and remove it along with the coagula of blood lying there.\r\n\r\nThe causes of difficult parturition, and the methods of remedying them,\r\nare more fully treated of by Aëtius than by any other ancient writer;\r\nbut, as Paulus evidently copies from him, we shall merely supply a few\r\nthings which our author has omitted. Among the causes of difficult\r\nlabour, he mentions too compact a union of the ossa pubis. When the woman\r\nis too young or too old, he justly remarks that she wants strength to\r\naccomplish delivery readily. He mentions that in the delivery of twins,\r\nthe two children may get entangled. He means, probably, that the head\r\nof the one may follow the delivery of the breach of the other. Of this\r\nsingular complication, a fatal case was published in the ‘Edinburgh\r\nMedical and Surgical Journal’ some years ago. He expresses himself\r\nfavorably with respect to feet presentations. All cross presentations are\r\nsaid to be difficult to rectify, but the child is to be brought by the\r\nhead or the feet according to circumstances. When delivery is retarded by\r\nrigidity of the parts, he strongly recommends the warm bath. When fulness\r\nof the bladder occasions obstruction, he properly directs the urine to\r\nbe drawn off by a catheter. When a foot or hand presents, he directs us\r\nnot to pull down the part, lest it become more firmly impacted, or lest\r\nit should be fractured or dislocated; but the projecting part is to be\r\npushed up and the position restored.\r\n\r\nAccording to Eros, one of the most common causes of difficult parturition\r\nis heat and tumefaction of the external parts. In this and in other\r\ncases, he directs the patient to sit in a bath prepared with emollient\r\nherbs, and to get the parts about the belly rubbed with oil of violets or\r\nof roses.\r\n\r\nSerapion treats this subject in nearly the same terms as our author.\r\nLike the Greeks, he approves of emollient oils and baths to produce\r\nrelaxation. The same practice is recommended likewise by Rhases. When the\r\nmembranes are tough, he advises us to tear them with the fingers, or to\r\nopen them with a knife.\r\n\r\nAvicenna has treated of difficult parturition with his usual accuracy,\r\nwhich exhausts every subject he handles. He states that the expulsion of\r\nthe child is performed by the abdominal muscles. This was the opinion of\r\nGalen; and we are inclined, upon the whole, to think it pretty correct.\r\nHe approves greatly of the bath, both before labour has come on and\r\nduring the time of it. When delivery is difficult, owing to the size\r\nof the child, he directs us to apply a fillet round the child’s head,\r\nand endeavour to extract it. When this does not succeed, the _forceps_\r\nare to be applied, and the child extracted by them. If this cannot be\r\naccomplished, the child is to be extracted by incision, as in the case\r\nof a dead fœtus. This passage puts it beyond a doubt that the Arabians\r\nwere acquainted with the method of extracting the child alive by the\r\n_forceps_.\r\n\r\nAlbucasis recommends us, when the membranes are tough, to perforate\r\nthem by the finger or a _spatumile_. When the waters are discharged,\r\nhe directs us to press down the woman’s belly so as to make the head\r\ndescend. If it does not come down readily, he advises us to give a\r\nclyster, and afterwards to apply compression to the belly. Albucasis also\r\napproves of the tepid bath. To promote the delivery of the secundines, he\r\nrecommends us to make the woman sneeze and retain her breath.\r\n\r\nAlsaharavius (probably the same as Albucasis) treats fully of the causes\r\nof difficult labours. When occasioned by dryness and constriction of\r\nthe vagina, he recommends baths, fomentations, and clysters, containing\r\nthe decoctions of mallows, fenugreek, and linseed; and also directs the\r\nparts to be rubbed with warm oil. When obstruction of the rectum by fæces\r\nprevents delivery, he advises us to administer a clyster. When intense\r\ncold is the cause of the difficulty, he recommends clysters of hot oil,\r\nand the warm bath. When the membranes are tough and retard delivery, he\r\ndirects the midwife to break them with a sort of reed or needle.\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas mentions imperforate hymen among the causes of difficult\r\nlabour. Such cases have been reported by modern writers on midwifery. See\r\nBaudelocque (§ 341), and Burns (Midwifery, x.) Fabricius ab Aquapendente\r\nrelates a very curious case in which conception had taken place without\r\nrupture of the hymen. (Œuvres Chirurg. ii, 81.) When the difficulty\r\narises from fatness and debility of the expulsive powers, Haly directs\r\nus to rub the parts with warm olive-oil, or other such emollients, and\r\nto make the woman sit in a bath prepared with chamomile, melilot, &c.\r\nHe mentions, as an internal remedy, the infusion of a swallow’s nest\r\n(alcyonium?) When the difficulty proceeds from cold, he recommends the\r\nuse of the tepid bath; and when from the contrary cause, he advises\r\ncooling things to be applied. According to Rhases, difficult parturition\r\nmay arise from the mother, the fœtus, or the secundines. He appears to\r\nhave considered all presentations unnatural except the head. In the other\r\ncases, he says, the life of the mother or child is endangered, although,\r\nhe adds, many living children are born by the feet. When delivery of the\r\nhead is found difficult, he recommends ligatures or fillets. When the\r\nfeet or hands present, he directs us to restore the position, or if that\r\nis impossible, to bring down the feet. Many of his authorities mention\r\nthe warm bath and lubricants.\r\n\r\nFrom the sketch which we have given above, it will be seen that the\r\nArabians have made mention of the forceps; but that most probably the\r\nGreeks and Romans were unacquainted with this instrument, as far, at\r\nleast, as appears from their works on medicine which have come down\r\nto us. It is deserving of remark, however, that in the house of an\r\n_obstetrix_ which has been excavated in Pompeii, there was found an\r\ninstrument of art bearing a very considerable resemblance to the modern\r\nforceps. It is a well-known fact in the history of inventions that many\r\nuseful discoveries have long been kept as family secrets. This was the\r\ncase even of a late date with the Chamberlains, who were the first in\r\nmodern times to use the forceps.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXVII.—ON ISCHIATIC DISEASE.\r\n\r\nIschiatic disease, being of the class of arthritic complaints, is\r\ndistinguished solely by the cause of it being seated in the hip-joint.\r\nThe cause of it then is a thick and pituitous humour fixed in the\r\narticulation of the hip-joint. The pain in these cases extends from the\r\nparts about the buttocks and groins to the knee, and often as far as the\r\nextremity of the foot. When we see such a patient, in the beginning of\r\nthe complaint, after the evacuation of the hardened fæces by a clyster,\r\nwe must abstract blood from the arm at intervals; but if the disease\r\nbe of some standing, we must abstract the blood from the ankle of the\r\naffected leg. During the exacerbations we must use this embrocation:\r\nOf the oil of privet, viij cyathi; of vinegar, iv cyathi; of nitre,\r\nij cyathi; of rosemary-seeds, j cyathus; to be rubbed in hot with\r\nunwashed wool. After which a cataplasm is to be applied of the flour\r\nof bitter lupines with oxymel; or of the flour of darnel with rosin,\r\nthe root of the wild cucumber, nitre, calamint, rosemary-seeds, and\r\nbay-berries. Calamint alone with oxymel, or honied water, will form a\r\nproper cataplasm. And we may rub the parts with this paregoric-plaster:\r\nOf wax, dr. x; of turpentine, dr. xxv; of verdigris, dr. vj; of myrrh, of\r\ngalbanum, of iris, of each, dr. vj; of gum vernix, dr. v. But they must\r\ntake the propoma containing Cyrenaic juice to the size of a bitter vetch,\r\nor a drachm of castor with three oboli of opopanax. And the rind of\r\nthe root of capers in a draught, or added to the cataplasms, is of use.\r\nWhen the pain is great, anodynes may have place, such as the antidote\r\nof Philo and that from two peppers. This injection is to be used: Of\r\nhoney, iss cyathus; of oil, iss cyathus; of water, ij cyathi; of nitre,\r\ndr. viij; of turpentine, dr. iv. These are to be injected warm, and the\r\nanus fomented, that they may be the longer retained. It evacuates mucous\r\nmatters, and sometimes blood when it affords more relief. But if the\r\ncomplaint be prolonged, which is rare, we must repeat it frequently,\r\ninstead of the water substituting the decoction of centaury. Blood is\r\nalso evacuated by injecting the seed of treacle-mustard, and the juice\r\nof elaterium, and the Sicyonian oil prepared from it, or from the roots\r\nof the plant. The brine also of pickled fish, or of pickled olives, may\r\nbe properly injected. Cupping-instruments may be applied to the hip with\r\nmuch heat and with scarifications, or sometimes leeches may be used.\r\nWhen the affection is protracted, we must proceed to purging either\r\nwith the hiera, or giving of the medullary part of colocynth properly\r\ntriturated to the amount of a drachm in two cyathi of honied water, more\r\nor less, according to the strength of the patient and the good state of\r\nhis bowels. And let rue be boiled in the honied water. The pottage made\r\nwith colocynth purges excellently. In some cases emetics from radishes\r\nhave proved beneficial at the commencement. During the remissions we may\r\napply dropaces to them, and use the restorative unguents (_acopa_) from\r\neuphorbium, and particularly the one called the complex. The natural\r\nbaths also are proper; or if these be not at hand, they may bathe in\r\nthe others; using the restorative ointments formerly mentioned, and\r\nthe compound ones,—the Æsculapian, and that composed of equal portions\r\nof euphorbium, adarce, black hellebore, castor, pellitory, pepper,\r\nand wild grape dried. After the bath, we must sprinkle upon the skin\r\nwhile still warm, of dried pitch, oz. iij; and of native sulphur, oz.\r\nij; and let the part be covered with paper. If even these things do\r\nnot succeed, a remnant of the disease remaining, it will be proper to\r\napply a cataplasm of mustard along with dried figs, or by itself. These\r\ncomplaints are completely removed by the Iberian herb, which some call\r\nlepidium, and some the wild cardamus (_cress_). And the shrub which\r\ngrows among us, having leaves resembling those of the bay, but much\r\nlarger, is of approved efficacy, not only in ischiatic, but in other\r\nchronic complaints; but it is by far most efficacious in summer. Or if\r\nit should not have shooted out its leaves, we must bruise the rind of\r\nthe root with axunge, so as to form a plaster; and then, spreading it\r\non a thick rag, apply to the parts affected with the pain, namely, to\r\nthe whole buttocks and thighs; and allow it to remain until the part\r\nbecome black, or, at all events, until the cuticle become livid; then\r\ntake it away, and, having washed, apply this cerate: Of opopanax, oz.\r\niv; dissolve in ij cyathi of vinegar; and add to the cerate of privet.\r\nIf they do not admit the use of such caustics, we must use the plasters\r\ncalled extirpative, among which is the following: Of wax, of pine-rosin,\r\nof each, dr. xij; of wild pigeon’s dung, of recent lees of burnt wine, of\r\neach, dr. vj; of galbanum, dr. iss. And the plaster called the Lioness\r\nis of the extirpative kind. Those composed from strained lye and nitre\r\nare also proper. And some have continued to drink certain potions for\r\na whole year, among which is the one composed of four ingredients: Of\r\nwall-germander, lb. j; of gentian, oz. ix; of round birthwort, oz. ix; of\r\nthe dried seed of rue, j sextarius: pound these things together, sift,\r\nand give every day a spoonful to the patient when he has an empty stomach\r\nand his digestion is good, with two cyathi of cold water; and continue\r\nthis for a year, until the complaint cease. And the medicine composed of\r\nseven ingredients, and that which takes its name from Proclus, are of the\r\nsame reputation. Exercise may be taken by walking, frequent bending of\r\nthe body, leaping, and running. The food should be moderately attenuant\r\nand digestible. If ischiatic disease do not yield to any of the remedies\r\nnow mentioned, it sometimes terminates in suppuration; and sometimes,\r\nfrom a relaxation of the ligaments, the thigh is dislocated at the joint.\r\nWherefore, when the affection is protracted, we must burn the joint in\r\nthree or four places (as will be described in the Surgical part of the\r\nWork), and the ulcers are to be kept open for many days.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Consult most of the authors referred to in the next Section.\r\n\r\nHippocrates gives a pretty correct account of the symptoms which attend\r\nan attack of morbus coxarius, or ischiatic disease. He says it most\r\ncommonly arises owing to the fluids of the joint being dried up by\r\nexposure to the sun. It is accompanied, he justly remarks, with pain of\r\nthe loins and vertebræ of the back, shooting down even to the knees. A\r\nsharp hot pain, he adds, is frequently seated in the groins. Upon any\r\nmotion the most piercing cries are extorted. (De Dieb. Judic. 6.)\r\n\r\nIn ischiatic disease Galen recommends general bleeding, and most\r\nespecially, emetics, which, he says, by occasioning a determination\r\nupwards, operate more beneficially than purgatives in this complaint.\r\nHe disapproves of acrid embrocations, but approves of cupping. He also\r\nallows stimulant clysters of colocynth. He gives a long list of local\r\napplications from Andromachus, Asclepiades, and Democritus. He makes\r\nmention of the Iberian herb; for further information respecting which we\r\nrefer the reader to Matthiolus (ad Dioscorid. i, 147), and Bernard (ad\r\nNonni Epit. 215.) It was the _Lepidium Iberis_. He recommends, in certain\r\ncases, the part to be beaten with rods. (Meth. Med. xiv, 16.) See also\r\nPseudo-Dioscorides. (Euporist. i, 240.)\r\n\r\nCelsus says that morbus coxarius is a painful complaint and difficult\r\nto cure. He recommends warm cataplasms and fomentations, with various\r\napplications of an emollient or stimulant nature. If inflammation come\r\non, cupping-instruments with scarifications are to be applied; diuretics\r\nare to be given; and the belly is to be opened if constipated. He also\r\napproves of friction, and even of forming issues by burning with a\r\nred-hot iron.\r\n\r\nVarious methods of performing the operation of burning are detailed by\r\nAëtius, as will be explained in the Surgical part of this Work.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus gives a long and interesting account of this complaint.\r\nAmong the symptoms he mentions the lengthening and shortening of\r\nthe limb, the wasting and paralysis of it. The periosteum, he says,\r\nis principally affected, but likewise the heads of the muscles. He\r\ncorrectly states that, when the complaint is protracted, collections\r\nare apt to form in the joint. He approves of the emollient treatment,\r\nthe application of wool dipped in sweet oil, fomentations, and bleeding\r\nfrom the arm. He recommends gentle purgatives and clysters, but condemns\r\nthe use of drastic cathartics, such as scammony, hellebore, and the\r\nlike; because, he says, they occasion irritation. When the pains are\r\nprotracted he approves of scarifications and leeching, after which the\r\nvapour of sponges squeezed out of hot water will be of service. He also\r\nmakes mention of the bath of oil and various emollient ointments. He\r\ndescribes several methods of applying heat to the part, but condemns them\r\nin general, upon the principle that they increase the local irritation.\r\nHe disapproves of diuretics as recommended by Diocles, and otherwise\r\nanimadverts freely upon the practice of the other sects.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians adopt the views of Galen and his followers with little\r\naddition or alteration. Thus Serapion recommends bleeding from the arm\r\nand ankle; clysters of drastic medicines, such as colocynth, centaury,\r\nhermodactylus, &c.; soothing applications externally; quieting medicines\r\ninternally; emetics consisting of radishes, vinegar of squills, or even\r\nof white hellebore. When these do not succeed, he recommends us to\r\nform an issue by burning the part with a red-hot iron. Avicenna agrees\r\nwith Galen in condemning discutients and recommending emollients at\r\nthe commencement, and in preferring emetics to cathartics. For this\r\npurpose he particularly mentions a solution of nitre and vinegar. When\r\nthe disease is combined with inflammation, Haly Abbas directs us to\r\nbegin with venesection if not otherwise contraindicated. He enjoins the\r\nnecessity of abstaining from taking much food and things of difficult\r\ndigestion. He directs us to pour water of a moderate temperature over the\r\npart, and to rub it with an emollient oil; but he forbids refrigerant\r\nand astringent things, as they are apt to drive the humour inwards.\r\nHe joins the others in recommending particularly the hermodactylus\r\n(_soureniaron_), both by the mouth and in clysters. When other means\r\nfail to remove the pain, he directs us to apply a cupping-instrument\r\nwith strong heat over the joint, or even to use the actual cautery.\r\nAlsaharavius recommends the same general plan of treatment. He directs\r\nthe patient to abstain from the use of wine, or if he cannot observe\r\nthis regimen, he recommends him to use the bath and friction with glass\r\n(pounded he probably means). He gives very excellent admonitions to guard\r\nagainst indigestion, and to avoid all things of a cold nature.\r\n\r\nOn the ancient cauteries for disease of the hip-joint, see Book Sixth,\r\nSect. LXXII.\r\n\r\nMost of the earlier modern writers approve of the application of the\r\nactual cautery for the cure of sciatica. See Rogerius (i, 74.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXVIII.—ON GOUT AND ARTHRITIS.\r\n\r\nIt is not weakness of the parts alone that occasions gouty and arthritic\r\ncomplaints; for then the paroxysms would be without ceasing, inasmuch as\r\nthe debility is always present in the weak parts. Neither is a humour the\r\nsole cause, for then the complaint had not attacked the joints only. But\r\nthe disease is occasioned by a preternatural humour and a weakness of the\r\nparts meeting together. For when the nutritive power of the parts becomes\r\ndebilitated from repletion with food inducing dyspepsia, the prevailing\r\nhumour, fixing in some of the joints which are already in a weak state,\r\nand stretching the nervous ligaments, produces pain. For the inflammation\r\nis not an original affection of the nerves of volition; as then it would\r\nhave affected also the parts between the joints, such as the middle of\r\nthe legs, thighs, arms, and forearms; but those of volition are affected\r\nsympathetically. When, therefore, the humour is seated in the joints of\r\nthe feet only, the complaint is called podagra; but when the cause is\r\ndiffused over all the joints of the body, we commonly call it arthritis,\r\nin which the vertebræ, scapulæ, jaws, and every other joint are attacked\r\nwith the disease. In certain cases the ears, teeth, and pharynx, and\r\nsometimes even the liver and spleen participate in the arthritic pains,\r\nwhen, if there is not a speedy translation of the disease to the joints,\r\nthe patients will be in urgent danger. The prevailing humour is sometimes\r\nbilious, sometimes sanguineous, sometimes melancholic, but for the most\r\npart it is pituitous and crude, being engendered by excess of food,\r\nindigestion, and want of exercise. When the disease is protracted in\r\nthe joints, the humours become thick and viscid, so as to form what are\r\ncalled tophi or chalk-stones. Sometimes the humour is of a compound\r\nnature, so that the disease is difficult to distinguish, and difficult\r\nto cure, or nearly incurable. The precursory causes of this affection\r\nfor the most part are immoderate labour, violent walking, frequent\r\nexercise on horseback, the unseasonable use of venery, cold drink taken\r\nunseasonably, eating of much cold or unwholesome food, and drinking much\r\nwine. And some from accidents, as a blow, a sprain, or the like, have\r\nexperienced the first attack of this complaint, the materials of the\r\ndisease having previously remained quiet in the system until roused by\r\nthe proximate cause. Sorrow, care, watchfulness, and the other passions\r\nof the mind, not only excite an attack of the disorder, but also generate\r\na cacochymy either primarily or incidentally. Wherefore the causes of\r\nthe complaint, as I have said, are various; but the differences of the\r\nnoxious humours are in so far easily detected, being discovered by their\r\ncolour and other symptoms. A bilious rheum, in addition to paleness and\r\nredness of colour, occasions a sensation of heat and acute pain, and is\r\nspeedily determined to the skin, nor is it attended with much swelling.\r\nIt is exacerbated by heating applications, and relieved again by cooling,\r\nwhich, for the most part, is the case with all the others, but more\r\nparticularly when the exciting cause is bilious. Fever also frequently\r\ncomes on at the height of the paroxysms, and then they are thirsty. Thus\r\nalso you will find the skin darker when from a melancholic humour; white\r\nand watery when from a pituitous, in which case the pain is more latent\r\nand more slowly occasions swelling; and the colour is sanguineous when a\r\nbloody humour prevails. In order to form a more decided diagnosis, you\r\nwill be assisted by taking into account the previous mode of life, and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n_The cure of rheums from a bilious humour._ The commencement of the cure,\r\nwhen from yellow bile, more especially if the quality of it occasion the\r\ndisorder, should be the evacuation of the offending humour by purgative\r\nmedicines, such as that from rhodomel, that from quinces, the antidote\r\ncalled picra, and aloetic pills. During the paroxysms, we may apply\r\nexternally rose-oil with the yelk of an egg, and some wine, rubbing\r\nthe part gently with it; and apply the herbs of a cold nature, such as\r\nnightshade, purslain, henbane, houseleek, marsh-lentil, endive, poppy,\r\nknotgrass, rose-leaves, and the like. These things may be sometimes\r\nrubbed in, and sometimes applied in the form of a cataplasm, with crumbs\r\nof bread soaked in oxycrate, or from barley-meal with rose-oil. When the\r\ninflammation of the joints is of an erysipelatous nature, a decidedly\r\nparegoric application is the peel of a fresh gourd laid on the part, or\r\nthe fleshy part of a pompion or cucumber, both alone and with bread; or\r\nthe leaves of perdicium (_pellitory of the wall?_), and ivy with bread\r\nand fine polenta. And fleawort boiled in barley-flour mitigates the\r\ninflammatory heat in a wonderful manner; and so also the rose-cerate\r\ncooled with some of the frigorific juices, and that prepared from the\r\nflour of beans. It is prepared thus: Of wax, oz. v; of chamomile-oil, oz.\r\niiss; of rose-oil, oz. iiss; of the flour of beans, oz. ss; the yelks\r\nof five eggs.—_Another_, a cataplasm: Pound green mallows boiled; and\r\nhaving made fleawort to the consistence of bird-lime separately, mix\r\ntogether; then add the red part of eggs and chamomile-oil, and apply as\r\na cataplasm. When the pain is great and difficult to endure, we must\r\nhave recourse to preparations of saffron, of horned poppy, and of opium,\r\ntriturating them with oxycrate, and then using them in the form of\r\nliniments, or of cataplasms with crumbs of bread. Galen makes mention of\r\nthis one: Of poppy-juice (_opium_), dr. iv; of saffron, dr. j; triturate\r\nwith milk of a cow or of a goat; or add the inner part of bread, and\r\nhaving softened it by touching it with a little rose-oil, use for a\r\ncataplasm. Or triturate the opium and saffron with the milk, and add to\r\nthe rose-cerate. And the cerate made from the torpedo and the oil of the\r\nsame are possessed of similar properties.—And this one in like manner:\r\nOf crumbs of bread soaked in water or in oxycrate, and of houseleek, or\r\nof nightshade, or of purslain, and of the fleshy parts of dates, and\r\nof poppy-seeds, equal parts; of roasted yelks of eggs and rose-oil, q.\r\ns.; form a cataplasm. The use of narcotics must not be continued, but\r\nuntil the violence of the pain be abated; for the frequent use of them\r\noccasions impaction and tophi, and makes the difficulty of motion to\r\nbe protracted. After the use of anodynes, then, we must have recourse\r\neither to diachylon dissolved in oil of chamomile, or the composition\r\nfrom marshmallows, or some such application. After we have warmed the\r\ncongealed parts, we must strengthen them by a plaster of dates dissolved\r\nin vinegar and rose-oil or wine and rose-oil. Or, if the weight of the\r\nplasters prove troublesome, we may rub in the juice of acacia with\r\noxycrate, or lycium along with saffron, horned poppy, and the juice of\r\nperdicias in oxycrate. The diet should be cooling and moistening, such as\r\nptisans, and spoon-meats from chondrus, and of pot-herbs, the mallows,\r\nthe lettuce, and the endive; and of birds, more especially the young of\r\ndomestic fowls; and of fishes, those caught in rocky places, and the\r\nsea-urchin, shell-fish, and the like. Let them avoid all things that are\r\nheating and form pale and yellow bile, old wines both the yellow and\r\ndark, and repletion. Let them use baths of sweet water, even at the time\r\nof the defluxions, as far as regards the cause of them, unless something\r\nelse prohibit. Let them avoid violent passion, abstinence, acrid food,\r\ndrinking of wine, immoderate labour, and venery.\r\n\r\n_The cure of rheums from a sanguineous humour._ In those cases in\r\nwhich the prevailing humour is sanguineous, we must have recourse to\r\nvenesection without delay, and also in cases where the prevailing humour\r\nis phlegm or black bile; since in them the humour is for the most part\r\ncontained in the veins, proving injurious by its quantity rather than\r\nits quality. We must have recourse then to venesection only at the first\r\nattack of the disease; since those who have had already frequent attacks\r\nof rheumatism are injured rather than benefited by the loss of blood,\r\nmore especially when the body is naturally cold or weak. After the\r\nevacuation of the blood, if there was more than a plethora of blood, we\r\nmust have recourse to purging with hiera after a short interval. And the\r\nJulian oxymel is a purgative suitable to these cases. Those who reject\r\nsuch purgative medicines may use these pills: Of aloes, of colocynth,\r\nof black hellebore, of scammony, of each, oz. j; of euphorbium, oz. ss;\r\nof nitre, oz. ss; mix with the juice of cabbage, and give according to\r\nthe patient’s strength. It will be better, however, if prepared with the\r\njuice of quinces.—Another pill given to gouty persons in the paroxysms,\r\nduring the remission, and from whatever humour: Of aloes, oz. vj; of\r\nagaric, oz. ss; of saffron, oz. ss; of costus, oz. j; of spikenard,\r\noz. j; of schenanth, oz. j; of balsam fruit, oz. j; of cassia, oz. ij;\r\nof scammony, oz. ij; of dodder of thyme, oz. iiiss. A moderate dose is\r\nscr. ij; and a full one, scr. iv. Pills of Armenian stone also purge\r\nin a wonderful manner, being particularly applicable in arthritic\r\ncases, whether given at the commencement, in the decline, or during the\r\nremissions of defluxion. And since some avoid scammony because it is bad\r\nfor the stomach, we may give them these things when a pituitous matter\r\nprevails: Of the medullary part of colocynth, of black hellebore, of\r\nbdellium, of gum, of aloes, of each, oz. j; of Alexandrian nitre, of\r\neuphorbium, of each, oz. ss. The dose is scr. iv. Instead of the gum I\r\nhave substituted dodder of thyme. Some, in the paroxysms of all arthritic\r\ndiseases, have recourse to purging with hermodactylus; but it is to be\r\nremarked that the hermodactylus is bad for the stomach, producing nausea\r\nand anorexia, and ought, therefore, to be used only in the case of those\r\nwho are pressed by urgent business; for it removes rheumatism speedily,\r\nand after two days at most, so that they are enabled to resume their\r\naccustomed employment. I knew a person who did not give the substance\r\nof hermodactylus, nor any of the compound medicines containing it; but\r\nboiling the plant itself with some of the common remedies, such as anise\r\nor parsley, he gave the decoction to drink; and it was wonderful how\r\nthose who got it, after having evacuations of the bowels, were freed from\r\nthe rheumatism. It is necessary, however, as I said, because the medicine\r\nis bad for the stomach, to correct the mouth of the stomach afterwards\r\nby stomachics and tonics, along with things that are moderately heating.\r\nAlexander says that purging by coronopodium is preferable to that by\r\nhermodactylus, as it procures evacuation and relief from pain, and at\r\nthe same time is not bad for the stomach. But topical applications are\r\nto be had recourse to in cases of pituitous rheumatism. When the pain\r\nis moderate, a green cabbage-leaf may be applied, and also parsley,\r\nfleabane, and the straight vervain; but when the pain is violent, take\r\nof the flour of fenugreek, p. iij; of the flour of darnel, p. j; of the\r\nflour of chick-peas, p. j; make a cataplasm with honied water, or thin\r\nwine, with a little oil of privet, or of nard, more especially if in\r\nwinter. And the ashes of burnt cabbage-roots, or of their stalks, when\r\nformed into a cataplasm with axunge, have proved beneficial to many; but,\r\nin order that it may prove soothing, the axunge must be fresh, whereas,\r\nif we wish it to be discutient, it must be old and salted. And in like\r\nmanner the dung of oxen, when boiled in honied water with barley-meal,\r\nor fresh moist dung applied with the leaves of cabbage; and so also\r\ngoats’ dung by themselves, or boiled with barley-flour in oxycrate. And\r\nsince some have derived relief from seemingly opposite remedies (for a\r\nmixture of various humours confounds the diagnosis), we must state the\r\nmaterials thereof promiscuously. Wherefore the wild and garden orach in\r\na cataplasm with bread are beneficial, or the leaves of petty mullein,\r\ntriturated with bulbi and bread, or with polenta, or the cataplasm of raw\r\nbarley-meal. Upon the whole, when the cause of the complaint is obscure,\r\nwe must change sometimes to medicines of the same class, and sometimes to\r\nthe opposite, not continuing long with the same application when it does\r\nnot afford relief. These things we see every day occur in professional\r\nmatters. And often a certain remedy proves beneficial to one joint,\r\nwhile another joint of the same patient similarly inflamed is not only\r\nnot benefited at the same time, but occasionally is even injured by it.\r\nAnd this is a wonderful circumstance, that one and the same joint, when\r\ntreated with the same remedy, is sometimes benefited, and soon afterwards\r\nexasperated. When a viscid and thick matter prevails, it is not perhaps\r\nrelieved by calefacients, but the acrid and hot quality of the humour\r\nprevailing is to be soothed by frigorific remedies; nor is it at all\r\nwonderful that a matter naturally cold, in the time of the inflammation,\r\nshould become heated and glowing, to say nothing of the admixture perhaps\r\nof bile. The flour of lupines with oxymel or oxycrate, or the root of\r\nlaserwort, or of bryony, with bread, prevent the formation of tophi. And\r\nthe following composition is safely soothing and moderately discutient:\r\nOf lycium, oz. j; of ammoniac perfume, oz. j; having triturated with very\r\nold wine and oil of unripe olives, boil, and add of the flour of beans,\r\nq. s.; and having boiled moderately, apply as a cataplasm. After the acme\r\nof the complaint, if a swelling be left, apply a cataplasm with the bulbi\r\nby themselves, or with fine polenta, until it produce excoriation; for in\r\nthis manner they act. When not relieved by the cataplasms, we may have\r\nrecourse to embrocations and affusions on the parts (more particularly\r\nif the extremities be affected), with chamomile, melilot, or centaury\r\nin decoctions. The preparation of capers has entirely relieved some.\r\nThe following is the most active of all the applications: Having boiled\r\nthyme, marjoram, savory, and calamint in the most acrid vinegar, bathe\r\nthe parts affected with the vinegar, not only once, but often in a day,\r\nwith confidence. This has relieved many when suffering not only from\r\nphlegm but also from bile.\r\n\r\nSome observe this practice also: The acorns of the ilex being powdered,\r\nare pounded and much boiled, and the joints of the extremities at the\r\ncommencement of the rheumatism are fomented for a considerable time with\r\nthe decoction, but it is poured from a sponge upon the inner parts;\r\nwhereby the violence of the offending matter is repelled. It also is\r\napplicable to bilious cases; and, in like manner, immersion in hot\r\nwater without any decoction. For pains occasioned by intense cold, or\r\ninfarction of the joints, this is a powerful remedy: Of old oil, lb. iss;\r\nof Alexandrian nitre, lb. j; of turpentine, lb. j; of euphorbium, oz.\r\nj; of iris, oz. ij; of the flour of fenugreek, a sextarius and a half.\r\nIn these cases the remedies recommended for ischiatics are excellently\r\napplicable. Many, in the case of those who are thus affected from a cold\r\ncause, apply, after the acme, mustard with dried figs and the other\r\nrubefacients, but some the preparation from cantharides. But these things\r\nprove injurious afterwards, unless one use the emollient applications,\r\nsuch as that from fuller’s herb, the one called Pyxis, that of Basilius,\r\nthat from the fir-tree, that from the poplar, those called Promium and\r\nLysiponium, and the stronger of the Acopa: in which cases sympathetic\r\naffections of the nerves and impaction of the humours particularly take\r\nplace. And the application from the urine of a mule, more particularly\r\nif applied at the acme, is beneficial in the cold rheums: and, in\r\nlike manner, the trochisk from the two hellebores is applicable for\r\nthe œdematous and spongy swellings; also fomentation with the toasted\r\nsalts; or otherwise affusion or embrocation with hot sea water; and the\r\nplasters prepared from salts, those from strained lye and nitre, and the\r\ncataplasms of a like nature after the acme. Food of a drier nature, and\r\nnot excrementitious, suits well with these; also abstinence from food,\r\nor a spare diet, and refraining from frequent baths. Having bathed, they\r\nshould be rubbed with nitre and the other unguents used for friction.\r\nIn the decline, they should have recourse in particular to gymnastic\r\nexercises and friction of the joints, and the natural baths, or the sand\r\nbaths, and emetics from radishes and food from grain. Those properly\r\nprepared for it may be vomited or purged with the white hellebore.\r\n\r\n_On rheums from a mixture of humours._ Those labouring under a mixture\r\nof humours, after the evacuation of the blood at the commencement of the\r\ndisease, should use the topical remedies already mentioned. When the\r\nsanguineous plethora is of a more bilious and acrid nature, recourse\r\nmay be had to those things recommended for bile; when it is of a colder\r\nand more pituitous or melancholic nature, those afterwards mentioned,\r\nwith the exception of such as are very acrid; and if protracted, these\r\nalso may be used. And this cataplasm is applicable at the commencement:\r\nPomegranate rind, sumach, and polenta triturated with wine, are\r\napplied in the form of a poultice.—_Another_: Having boiled the leaves\r\nof cabbage, and triturated carefully, add the lees of vinegar, two\r\nyelks of raw eggs and a little rose-oil, and having triturated, apply,\r\nchanging it frequently. Let them take food that is attenuant and of\r\nlittle nourishment. Let them, therefore, abstain altogether from flesh\r\nand pulse, from much wine of a dark colour; and, if possible, let them\r\nabstain from drinking wine altogether. For I have known many persons\r\nwho have abstained altogether from this article alone, and all of them\r\nderived benefit. Those who did so in the commencement of the complaint\r\nwere entirely freed from it; and those who were later in doing so\r\nexperienced afterwards fewer paroxysms, and these not of great severity.\r\nIf, therefore, no inconvenience occur, or be dreaded from it, they should\r\nabstain from wine all their life. Those who from weakness or coldness\r\nof constitution appear to sink under this regimen, after abstaining\r\nfrom wine for two years, may gradually accustom themselves to take a\r\nsmall quantity of diluted wine. Those who refrain from wine should take\r\ninstead of it a decoction of anise, or of some such seeds, avoiding\r\naltogether the use of the autumnal fruits, and other things of a cold\r\nnature, and also venery. Of those who attempt to get rid of the complaint\r\nby continuing under a course of medicines for a complete year, many who\r\nsuffer from pituitous and redundant humours have been benefited thereby,\r\nwhereas such as are of a hot and dry intemperament have brought on sudden\r\ndeath, the offending matter being translated to the intestines, kidneys,\r\nside, lungs, or some vital part. It is better, therefore, for those who\r\nare bilious and sanguineous, to abstain from wine; as from this course\r\nthere is no risk of falling into the dangers just mentioned. Those who\r\nare affected with cold and redundant humours should take the theriac\r\nof vipers more frequently if they have good digestion in winter, but\r\nmore rarely in summer; for it either removes the complaint altogether\r\nor renders it more moderate, and proves injurious to none of the\r\nafore-mentioned parts. And since some persons compel us to administer the\r\nmedicines called Antidotes, you should be aware that the following are\r\nall of the same kind, namely, that from water plantain, that of Agapetus,\r\nthose called Atacton and Octaidon, that of Proclus, that from water\r\ngermander, that from coral, and many others. The safest of them all, and\r\nyet of approved efficacy, is the one from coral, which dissolves tophi\r\nthat are formed in the joints. The properties of all these things, the\r\nmanner of using them, and the precautions to be observed with regard to\r\nthem, you will find described in the Pharmaceutical part of this Work;\r\nand also the composition of depilatories for arthritic complaints, and\r\nthe mode of applying them to these habits, I mean the pituitous. Some,\r\nfor the entire removal of the complaint, boil whole wolves in oil,\r\nwherewith they cure arthritic cases; some throwing them in alive, and\r\nothers dead, into a large caldron. And in like manner they boil hyænas,\r\nmaking a discutient oil from them; and then filling the cistern of the\r\nbath with it, and putting the arthritic patients into it, they direct\r\nthem to remain in it for a considerable time. By these means it happens\r\nthat not only the swellings about the joints, but the whole body, is\r\nevacuated.\r\n\r\n_On tophi, or chalk-stones._ Since tophi are often formed in the\r\njoints, sometimes owing to a thick and terrene humour seating in\r\nthe parts, and sometimes owing to the use of applications which are\r\nimmoderately discutient and desiccant without being emollient, it is\r\nproper to know that the most suitable remedies are such as are at\r\nthe same time emollient and discutient. Wherefore, old suet, marrow,\r\nammoniac, bdellium, very old oil, and storax, are emollient; and nitre,\r\nsalts, strained lye, adarce, euphorbium, and the like, are discutient\r\nand desiccative. This is an excellent application for tophi in the\r\njoints: Very old and acrid cheese pounded and applied with a decoction\r\nof fat swines’ flesh, it also being old. For the chalk-stone breaking\r\nspontaneously, a discharge of it takes place every day. The composition\r\nfrom ham (which is prepared in two ways) is also an approved remedy, and\r\nthose described from strained lixivial ashes (potash?). And this one is\r\nparticularly excellent: Of aphronitrum, of turpentine, of protostacton,\r\nof virgin wax (i.e. _bee-glue_), of each, oz. iv; of wax, oz. ix; of\r\ncolophonian rosin, lb. j; of oil, oz. xvj; mix together, and use for\r\nchalk-stones and apostemes. The composition from dragon’s blood is of\r\nwonderful efficacy for chalk-stones and many other complaints, but is\r\ndifficult to procure. But that from walnuts is not only efficacious but\r\nat the same time easily procured; and is applicable not only to those who\r\nare strong, but also to those who are sensitive, if mixed with honey or\r\nthe composition from anemone, in the proportion of two parts to one of\r\nthe composition. When these things are not at hand, an equal proportion\r\nof ceruse may often be mixed with it.—_Another for tophi_: Having\r\ntriturated red arsenic, mix with mistletoe of the oak, and use.—_Another,\r\nwhich is applicable also for fistula and ægilops_: Of oil, one sextarius;\r\nof litharge, oz. viiiss; of arsenic, oz. j; boil the litharge and the oil\r\nuntil they do not stain, then sprinkle the arsenic well levigated, and\r\nbefore it catch fire, take off and use. The compositions from the flower\r\nof Assian stone, when used during the intervals, are applicable to all\r\nthe collections which form in the joints; and some of the ancients attest\r\nthat they remove the complaint entirely. The composition from the flower\r\nof salt, when applied in like manner during the remissions, is believed\r\nto dissipate whatever swellings remain.\r\n\r\n_On the prophylaxis of gout._ Gout and rheumatism, when formed, are\r\namong the most difficult of diseases to cure, except by the methods we\r\nhave described; but, before being fixed, it is easy to prevent their\r\noccurrence by restricting the diet, giving only such food as is of easy\r\ndistribution and not excrementitious, with a moderate allowance of\r\nwine, and increasing the exercise as far as proper. As a remedy, salts\r\ntriturated with oil and rubbed into the joints, are of great use to all\r\nwho are anxious to avoid falling into a gouty affection, unless they\r\nbe of a dry intemperament. They ought to use it morning and evening\r\nthrough life, and the same thing is to be used after the decline of the\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY.

Junct., and Contin. xxvi.)\r\n\r\nThe Prognostics of Hippocrates will be admitted at the present day to\r\nbe correct. Those who are old, or who have chalk-stones formed in their\r\njoints, or lead a laborious course of life, or have dried bellies, cannot\r\nbe cured by any human means. Young persons not having _tophi_ formed\r\nin their joints, and who live guardedly, and whose bowels will bear\r\nthe proper treatment, may be cured. These complaints are best removed\r\nby dysenteries or other evacuations downwards. His principal remedies\r\nare purgatives administered by the mouth or by injection, and local\r\napplications of a cooling nature, and even pouring cold water on the\r\nfoot. When the pain of the gout becomes fixed in a joint, he directs us\r\nto burn it with crude flax.\r\n\r\nSeneca mentions it as a monstrous example of the depravity of his age,\r\nthat the women, by their luxurious habits, had become subject to gout.\r\n(Epist. 95.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Galen, gout and arthritic complaints are occasioned by\r\na collection of some humour in the affected part. This humour may be\r\nblood, phlegm, or a mixture of phlegm and bile, or of blood along with\r\nthese, or simply a crudity. This crude humour, he remarks, sometimes\r\nconcretes into _tophi_. The first indication in attempting the cure is to\r\nevacuate the offending humour by bleeding or purging; and then repellent\r\nand discutient applications are to be used. He has given a great many\r\nprescriptions for these. He disapproves of the warm bath in rheumatic\r\nattacks; for, he says, although it appears at first to give relief, it\r\nultimately aggravates the complaint. (Therap. ad Glauc. ii.)\r\n\r\nFor an able and full explication of the ancient theory of the humours,\r\nand the manner in which they give rise to arthritic complaints, we refer\r\nthe reader to Macrobius (l. c.)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the chapter of Aretæus on the treatment of arthritic\r\ncomplaints has come down to us in a mutilated state. It appears however,\r\nthat he trusted to hellebore as the great remedy in such cases. His local\r\napplications are wool dipped in rose-oil and wine; a sponge soaked in\r\noxycrate, or such like cataplasms. When the disease is hereditary, he\r\nsays it is generally incurable.\r\n\r\nCelsus recommends various refrigerant and anodyne applications to the\r\naffected part, such as a sponge soaked in cold water, or in oil and\r\nvinegar, or the same soaked in hot water having poppies boiled in it,\r\nor a mixture of pitch, wax, and alum. The other points of his practice\r\ndeserve attention, but we shall not enter upon them, as we wish to afford\r\nroom for a fuller abstract of the doctrines of Alexander.\r\n\r\nGout, according to Psellus, is occasioned by an atony of the nutritive\r\nfaculty, whereby a thick humour is collected in the system.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus recommends his favorite remedy for local pains, namely,\r\nthe application of a living torpedo to the part affected.\r\n\r\nAlexander begins with noticing the common opinion that gout is\r\nirremediable by the art of medicine, which he affirms not to be the case\r\nprovided proper attention be paid to the different varieties of it. There\r\nare, he says, many causes of the disease; for sometimes a hot blood flows\r\ninto the cavity of the joint and occasions violent pains; and, in like\r\nmanner, a defluxion of bile getting between the tendons and ligaments\r\noccasions pain by burning and stretching the parts: phlegm likewise,\r\nby producing cold and compression, becomes the cause of violent pains;\r\nand in like manner the melancholic humour, not only by its coldness and\r\npressure but also by occasioning a sense of heaviness, brings on no\r\nordinary paroxysms. Sometimes a simple quality of the humours, such as\r\nheat, cold, dryness, or humidity, will cause a defluxion. The prevalence\r\nof a bilious humour is ascertained by the absence of swelling; from the\r\npain being rather a fiery heat than distension; and from the colour being\r\nred. The proper remedies in this case are cholagogues, which must not be\r\nof a heating nature nor offensive to the stomach; for when the stomach\r\nis deranged the nerves sympathise and rheumatism is the consequence.\r\nHe gives prescriptions for a variety of such compositions containing\r\nscammony, agaric, and the like, mixed with pepper, &c. He particularly\r\ncommends pills of scammony and wormwood. He also recommends cooling and\r\nanodyne applications to the affected parts, such as rose-oil with the\r\nyelk of an egg, and the like. He enjoins particular attention to the\r\ndiet, in order to avoid such things as have a tendency to form bile.\r\nHe recommends moderate exercise rather before than after a meal, but\r\nforbids to carry it to excess. He speaks favorably of baths of common\r\nwater. He concludes this part with minute directions about the local\r\napplications: but, as we have already stated his principles, we shall\r\nnot enter upon the detail of his practice. When gout is occasioned by\r\nphlegm the part is neither hot nor red; is benefited by calefacients and\r\ninjured by refrigerants. For this variety he recommends particularly a\r\ncombination of purgative and attenuant medicines, such as the Julian\r\noxymel, which contained white hellebore, agaric, polypody, thyme, cumin,\r\n&c. After purging he greatly commends hot and attenuant medicines, in\r\nparticular the composition from coral, which, among other ingredients,\r\ncontained birthwort, spikenard, cloves, myrrh, &c. (Birthwort formed\r\none of the principal ingredients of the celebrated Portland powder.) He\r\ndescribes various other antidotes containing bitters, attenuants, and\r\ncalefacients. His local applications in this case are pounded cabbage,\r\nparsley-seed, or fleabane, if the pain is moderate; but otherwise he\r\nrecommends anodyne cataplasms. Should these, however, rather produce\r\nan increase of the pain, he directs us to substitute instead of them\r\ndiscutient and repellent applications, such as decoctions of thyme,\r\nmint, &c. with vinegar. He also recommends various cerates with the same\r\nintention. Some, he says, have been benefited by stronger applications,\r\nsuch as blisters of cantharides, sinapisms, or the like; but he does\r\nnot approve of the barbarous practice of burning with the substances\r\ncalled _iscæ_ (see Aëtius and Paulus), nor of the above-mentioned\r\nrubefacients, but prefers a combination of emollients with discutients.\r\nWhen it is suspected that the gout proceeds from an overflow of blood\r\nupon the joint, he recommends us to have recourse to bloodletting, unless\r\notherwise contra-indicated. He proscribes such articles of food as\r\nengender much blood, as all sorts of flesh, especially pork; also sweet\r\nwines and intemperance of every kind. He says he has known some cured by\r\nsimply refraining from wine. He then gives directions for the formation\r\nof several topical applications which are of a repellent and discutient\r\nnature. He speaks very favorably of a sponge soaked in an astringent\r\nwine or oxycrate. He then gives ample directions for discussing Tophi or\r\nchalk-stones. He lays it down as a general rule that such applications\r\nshould contain ingredients of a moderately calefacient, discutient, and\r\nsolvent nature. Among the articles which enter into these compositions we\r\nremark litharge, old oil, sanguis draconis, nitre, turpentine, ammoniac,\r\n&c. He then states, that as some do not choose to submit patiently to\r\nthe methodical plan of treatment, but insist upon getting medicines\r\nto allay at once the violence of the pains, he, although he did not in\r\ngeneral approve of this practice, would now give an account of such\r\nremedies. For this purpose, he says, _hermodactylus_ is particularly\r\ntrusted to by some; and he admits that it seldom fails to remove a\r\nparoxysm, but affirms that it occasions more frequent returns of it.\r\nSome, he adds, have endeavoured to correct its prejudicial effects by\r\nadding to it cumin, mastich, or ginger, thinking that its action is\r\nnarcotic; but this he affirms to be a mistake, for in that case it could\r\nnot prove cathartic. He admits, however, that these things may prove\r\nuseful by correcting its bad effects upon the stomach. He then gives\r\nvarious receipts for mixtures containing hermodactylus. As a specimen\r\nof them we may mention the first, which consists of hermodactylus,\r\nmyrrh, pepper, and anise, to which scammony may be added. He recommends\r\nit, however, in general, to be given in the form of pills with aloes,\r\nscammony, elaterium, and colocynth. But, as mentioned by our author,\r\ninstead of it he prefers the coronopodium. It is the same, we presume,\r\nas the coronopus of Dioscorides, or our buckthorn plantain (_plantago\r\ncoronopus_ L.), although the commentators are not agreed upon this point.\r\n(See Matthiolus.) Gesner supposes it a species of _ranunculus_, which he\r\ncalls _polyanthemon_. Alexander then gives directions for various local\r\napplications of an anodyne nature, containing opium, strychnos, ceruse,\r\nwax, &c. We regret to say that so admirable a treatise should conclude\r\nwith some frivolous directions for curing the disease by means of amulets\r\nof approved efficacy! However, the advocates of the Mesmerian system of\r\nanimal magnetism do not hesitate to admit their remedial powers. On the\r\nperiapta or amulets of the ancients, see Andreas Laurentius (de Marab.\r\nStrum. Sanat, 85.)\r\n\r\nOur limits will not permit us to do justice to the account of the\r\ngout given by Aëtius. Like Aretæus, he maintains that the disease is\r\nhereditary. His general views of the nature of the complaint and his\r\ntreatment are very plausible. He says it is occasioned by weakness\r\nof the part and a redundance of humours; that the proper treatment\r\ntherefore consists in evacuating the humours by bleeding and purging, and\r\nafterwards in strengthening the part.\r\n\r\nCælius Aurelianus considers arthritis, podagra, and chiragra, as diseases\r\nof the same genus. The usual precursory causes are intemperance,\r\nindigestion, debauchery, cold, too much or too little exercise, and\r\nexternal injuries. Some, he adds, are of opinion that it is transmitted\r\nfrom father to son. He gives the symptoms of these complaints with his\r\nwonted accuracy. They are seated for the most part, he says, in the\r\nnerves, by which term he probably means the tendons and membranes. He\r\nremarks the well-known propensity which persons attacked with gout have\r\nto attribute the swelling and pain to a sprain or some such accident.\r\nIf the belly be constipated, he advises us to open it by a simple\r\nclyster. He recommends us to abstract blood from the affected part by\r\nscarifications, which, he says, will occasion less irritation than\r\ncupping or leeching. Sponges squeezed out of hot water, or oil and water,\r\nor the decoction of fenugreek, are then to be applied to the part; for he\r\nthinks these preferable to a cataplasm, as it is often too heavy. When\r\non the decline, he approves of bathing, spare diet, emollient ointments,\r\nand gentle exercise, beginning with gestation, and proceeding to the\r\nstronger kinds of it. When they can be borne, he approves of stimulant\r\napplications, such as dropaces, heated sand, and even sinapisms. He also\r\nspeaks favorably of vomiting produced by radishes, hellebore, hip-baths\r\nof oil, fomentations with hot salt water, and swimming in hot water or\r\neven in cold. He particularly commends the naturally-medicated waters, or\r\nspas (as they are now called), such as those of Albula or Cutilia, which,\r\nhe says, will either cure or mitigate the complaint. He disapproves of\r\nburning the joints (the reader will have remarked his general aversion\r\nto the cautery), and the indiscriminate application of various narcotics\r\nand other such things. He also condemns the free use of emetics, (which,\r\nhe says, prove injurious to the stomach, and occasion a determination\r\nto the head,) of purgatives, acrid clysters, and diuretics. In short,\r\nhis practice is not unlike that of our Sydenham. His grand rule is to\r\nkeep upon a spare diet, or even to maintain complete abstinence at the\r\ncommencement. The formula for his diacentaureo (as Van Swieten remarks)\r\nis the same as that for the Portland powder, namely, Aristoloch. rotundæ;\r\ngentianæ; sum. chamædryos; centaur. min. p. æquales. Cælius Aurelianus,\r\nGalen, Aëtius, Celsus, Aretæus, Oribasius, Scribonius, and Horatianus\r\nmake no mention of the hermodactylus. Myrepsus and Actuarius make mention\r\nof a hermodactylus, but Matthiolus and the commentator on the former\r\nthink theirs a different plant from the hermodactylus of the other Greek\r\nauthors. This may be true, and yet the microscopic eye of critics often\r\nfancies it can see differences which other people are puzzled to remark.\r\nWe may mention further regarding the practice of Cælius Aurelianus, that\r\nhe speaks of soothing the pains of rheumatism, more especially of the\r\nhip-joint, by music. On this practice see also Aulus Gellius (iv, 13);\r\nAthenæus (Deipnos. xiv, 18); Apollonius (Hist. Marab.); Pliny (H. N.\r\nxxviii, 2.)\r\n\r\nThere is nothing very important in Nonnus, Octavius Horatianus, or\r\nOribasius. We shall now give a brief abstract of the curious treatise\r\non the gout by Demetrius Pepagomenos. The work is dedicated to the\r\nEmperor Michael Paleologus, who flourished about the year 1260; and it\r\nwas published by Morel at Paris, A.D. 1558. The author commences by\r\nexplaining the nature of that derangement of the animal economy which\r\noccasions this complaint. This he does at considerable length, but in\r\nmuch the same terms as Macrobius, to whom the reader has been already\r\nreferred for an exposition of the humoral pathology. His physiological\r\nopinions appear to us to be highly ingenious and philosophical. He comes\r\nto the conclusion that gout is occasioned by a collection of humours\r\nin the affected joint, these humours being the product of imperfect\r\ndigestion and of the retention of excrementitious superfluities, which\r\nought to have been evacuated from the system. He says the procatarctic or\r\nremote causes of arthritic affections are, long-continued indigestion,\r\nrepletion with food, drinking too much wine, venery, unusual exercise,\r\nindolence, and retention of the natural secretions. Venery, in\r\nparticular, is said to weaken the tone of the nervous parts. He then\r\nproceeds to explain that when crudities are formed in the system, those\r\nparts which are strong and vigorous cast them off, which those that are\r\nweak cannot effect, and hence collections of such humours take place\r\nin them. The prophylaxis of the complaint, he remarks, is easily laid\r\ndown, but is difficult to follow, namely, to observe great moderation in\r\neating and drinking, and to avoid indigestion. His grand principle of\r\npractice is evacuation, which, according to the general rule laid down\r\nby Hippocrates, is the proper remedy for repletion. He then shows that\r\nvomiting is the mode of evacuation most applicable in this complaint,\r\nbecause it empties the stomach, which is the fountain whence the\r\nhumours are derived. His comparison of the stomach to a fountain which\r\nirrigates all parts of the system is very appropriate, and is beautifully\r\nillustrated by him. He recommends, however, vomiting by simple means; and\r\nfor this purpose directs the patient to swallow meat imperfectly chewed,\r\nradishes, leeks, &c. and, having drunk some honied water, to excite\r\nvomiting by tickling the throat with a feather or the finger. He forbids\r\nthe use of strong emetics. His second method of evacuation is by purging,\r\nwhich he recommends to be done by pills containing aloes, hermodactylus,\r\ncinnamon, and scammony. He then proceeds to the cure when an attack has\r\ncome on. In this case, he recommends us to begin with letting blood,\r\nunless the stomach be loaded with impurities, when an emetic must be\r\npremised, lest the emptiness of the veins produced by venesection should\r\ncause these crude humours to be conveyed over the body. Venesection,\r\nhe remarks, is particularly applicable at the commencement, when there\r\nis simply a plethora of blood, but it is rather prejudicial afterwards\r\nwhen the fluids become altered in quality. In such cases, as he fully\r\nexplains, purging is the proper remedy, especially when performed by\r\nhermodactylus, which, he says, he had found from experience to answer\r\nwell, from whatever cause the disease had originated. He directs it to\r\nbe combined with various calefacients and aromatics, such as birthwort,\r\ncinnamon, and pellitory. He then makes an ingenious reply to those who\r\naffirmed that the disease is not to be cured by purgatives, but that it\r\nis sometimes exacerbated by them. In such cases, he properly remarks, it\r\nis not the remedy that is in fault but the misapplication of it. Those\r\nwho cannot bear cathartics by the mouth may have clysters given them;\r\nor the preparations from elaterium, juice of sow-bread, or the like,\r\nmay be applied to the navel. He afterwards gives directions about the\r\nlocal applications, which are nearly the same as those recommended by\r\nAlexander. We will have occasion, in the Seventh Book, to discuss the\r\nquestion respecting the nature of the ancient hermodactylus; and we\r\nshall merely state here our own decided persuasion that it was a species\r\nof colchicum or meadow-saffron. It forms one of the ingredients of the\r\ncelebrated _Eau médicinale d’Husson_. From the effects produced by the\r\n_Eau médicinale_ we are inclined to think, however, that a certain\r\nproportion of hellebore must have entered into its composition, as we\r\nhave never found the colchicum to act so violently as the _eau_ is said\r\nto do. We have stated above that Cælius Aurelianus makes no mention of\r\nthe hermodactylus. However, the great modern advocate for Methodism,\r\nProsper Alpinus, speaks favorably of it, and says decidedly that it is\r\nthe colchicum of the Greeks. It appears not to have fallen into disuse in\r\nhis time. (De Med. Meth. ix, 4.)\r\n\r\nThe Arabians follow the Greeks closely in the general principles of\r\ntreatment, only substituting certain articles introduced into the Materia\r\nMedica by themselves. Thus Serapion strongly recommends purging with\r\nmyrobalans, prunes, and tamarinds. He, Avicenna, and Rhases, join in\r\npraising the virtues of the hermodactylus. Their local applications are\r\nsimilar to those of the Greeks. When the pain is violent, Serapion even\r\napproves of pouring cold water upon the affected part. Rhases approves\r\nof burning the joint in certain cases. Avicenna directs us to cover the\r\npart with oil and salt, and thus to apply the cautery gradually. Avicenna\r\nspeaks more favorably of bathing in thermal waters than any of the other\r\nauthorities. According to Haly Abbas, arthritic diseases are collections\r\nof superfluities of the system in some joint which is labouring under\r\ndebility. These superfluities are said to be produced by repletion and\r\nindigestion. The debility is generally occasioned by immoderate exercise,\r\nintemperance, debauchery, or some such cause; and a joint having become\r\nweakened, all the impurities of the system are collected into it. He\r\nsays that young persons and women who menstruate regularly are scarcely\r\nliable to the gout. He agrees with the authorities already mentioned in\r\nholding it to be hereditary. When the humour in the joints concretes into\r\nchalk-stones, he pronounces the case to be incurable. When the disease\r\nis produced by a sanguineous plethora, he recommends us to begin with\r\nbleeding, and then to use cooling lotions, or even to pour cold water on\r\nthe joint. When these do not succeed, anodyne applications, containing\r\nopium, mandragora, lettuce, saffron, and the like, are to be used.\r\nWhen the pain has abated, any swelling which remains may be discussed\r\nby applying to the part a decoction of marjoram, melilot, chamomile,\r\nand the like. When the defluxion is connected with bile, he recommends\r\nfirst emetics, and then drastic purgatives, such as aloes, scammony,\r\ncolocynth, and hermodactylus. But, if the patient’s stomach be weak,\r\nhe recommends milder laxatives. When the defluxion is of a phlegmatic,\r\nthat is to say, of a serous nature, he directs us to give the active\r\ncathartics already mentioned, especially hermodactylus; and, if it be\r\nthe summer season, he advises us also to give emetics. He cautions us\r\nagainst using local applications of too stimulant a nature at first,\r\nlest they dispel the more fluid parts of the defluxion and leave the\r\ngrosser behind. This is but a meagre sketch of his interesting account of\r\narthritic diseases. Alsaharavius calls these complaints collections of\r\nphlegm, bile, or blood. He holds that they are often hereditary. Like all\r\nhis countrymen, he approves of hermodactylus, which he gives in the form\r\nof pills, with myrobalans, colocynth, turbit, castor, opopanax, &c. When\r\nfulness of blood is present, he recommends bleeding.\r\n\r\nThe hermodactylus is recommended for the cure of arthritic diseases by\r\nthe earlier of the modern writers on medicine. See Lanfrancus (ii, 3.)\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient treatises on gout, we have mentioned the tragi-comic\r\npoem entitled ‘Tragodopodagra,’ usually ascribed to the famous Lucian.\r\nIt ridicules, with much humour and severity, the many pretended nostrums\r\nfor this complaint. Among the remedial articles mentioned, we remark\r\nhellebore, nitre (_soda_), henbane, poppy, fenugreek, and galls. The\r\nridicule thus bestowed upon the use of specifics for the cure of a\r\ncomplaint so complicated as gout, is no doubt well founded; but we\r\nought not to be deterred, by the ill success of such a practice, from\r\nattempting to afford relief upon general principles, as ably laid down\r\nby Alexander, Demetrius, and Haly Abbas. We would fain impress upon the\r\nphysician and his patient, that more than is usually believed might be\r\naccomplished in all arthritic diseases, by correcting the disorder of the\r\ndigestive functions by means of a suitable diet and regimen; and that it\r\nis only when the constitution is radically unsound—when the joints are\r\ndeformed by concretions, and the vital powers have been worn out by a\r\nlong-continued course of debauchery—that we need adopt the discouraging\r\nopinion of Ovid, as expressed in the following line:\r\n\r\n    “Tollere nodosam nescit medicina podagram.”\r\n\r\n                              (Pont. i, el. 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXIX.—ON CHILBLAINS AND AFFECTIONS OF THE FEET AND HEELS.\r\n\r\nChilblains are ulcerous affections forming about the fingers and toes\r\nin the season of winter. They should be bathed with tepid sea water,\r\nor the decoction of beet, or of lentil, or of bitter vetch, or of the\r\nroot of kingspear. After this, triturate boiled lentils with wine,\r\nand apply in the form of a cataplasm; or, apply figs triturated with\r\noil; or, triturate equal portions of alum and barley-flour in wine,\r\nand apply; or use a cataplasm of dried lees of wine or of fresh bulbi\r\ntriturated with wine; or boil garlic in oil, and having thrown away the\r\ngarlic, melt a moderate quantity of wax with the oil, and apply; or boil\r\npomegranate-rind in wine, and having triturated, add to the rose-cerate,\r\nand use, having previously fomented the part with the decoction of\r\nlupines; or apply manna and native sulphur with boiled honey. The juice\r\nof henbane rubbed frequently into the part removes the inflammation and\r\npain.\r\n\r\n_The Marcellian application for chilblains._ Having scooped out the\r\nheart of a turnip, put into the cavity two ounces of wax, and the same\r\nquantity of lentisk oil; and having boiled them in a double vessel along\r\nwith sea water, brine, or the decoction of lupines, bathe the part with\r\nthe fluid; and having cooled the cerate which is melted in the turnip,\r\napply it. For ulcerated chilblains: Of frankincense, of fissile alum, of\r\nreddle, of rosin, equal parts; dilute with axunge, and use. For ulcers\r\nwith inflammation, use the application called Hexapharmacon: Of oil, oz.\r\nix; of bull’s tallow and gall, of each, lb. ij; of litharge, oz. vj; of\r\ncolophonian rosin, oz. iv; of honey, oz. vj.\r\n\r\n_For fissures of the toes and of the whole feet._ Anoint with liquid\r\npitch; or, having burnt a river or sea-crab on coals, scrape off the\r\nshell, and having triturated it with oil, and made of the consistence of\r\nhoney, and having wiped the fissures, apply. The inner part of squill\r\nboiled in oil and triturated with turpentine also answers well; and a\r\ngoat’s horn burnt and mixed with axunge. One must first clear the callous\r\npart, and then use the medicines.\r\n\r\n_The plaster called the florid for fissures of the heels and soles._\r\nOf quicklime, dr. x; of ceruse, dr. xx; of wax, dr. xx or xxx; of\r\nfresh axunge, oz. vij; of colophonian rosin, oz. ix; of the juice of\r\nlinseed, one cyathus; of sweet oil, oz. xl; nothing is so efficacious\r\nfor softening the sole.—_Another_: Of goats’ seam, of wax, of oil, equal\r\nparts; use.—_Another_: Having boiled pomegranate-rind in vinegar, apply\r\nfor five days; then, having cleaned it away, apply quicklime with oil, or\r\nwith bath sordes.—_Another_: Having boiled squill in oil, throw away the\r\nsquill when boiled: having melted some turpentine in this oil, use.\r\n\r\n_For fretting of the heels from long confinement in bed._ Of wax, of oil,\r\nof litharge, of honey, equal parts. It answers with every ulcer of the\r\nsoles, heels, ankles, and inner part of the toes, more especially if the\r\nsore be near the nail.\r\n\r\n_For foul ulcers in the sole, and also for those in the pudendum; To\r\nbe applied on a pledget._ Of lees of oil, one cyathus; of vinegar, one\r\ncyathus; having boiled in a copper vessel until of the consistence of\r\nhoney, and triturated separately with ij dr. of the flakes of copper, and\r\nij dr. of manna, add the ashes of a handful of soft unwashed wool which\r\nhas been wrapped round a torch and burnt: mix all together, and use,\r\ndiluting it with wine for wounds, and with must for those of the pudendum\r\nand sole.—_Another_: Of lees of oil, of scummed honey, equal parts. This\r\nalso cleans the gums.\r\n\r\n_For fretting of the skin by shoes._ The lungs of a lamb, of a swine, or\r\nof a goat, make a good application. The burnt leather of old shoes does\r\nnot answer when there is inflammation; but when the inflammation is over\r\nit answers well. Or, apply onions with the grease of a fowl; or sprinkle\r\nthe part with burnt gall; or dissolve acacia in vinegar, and anoint with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Hippocrates (Epidem. vii, 38); Celsus (v, 28); Scribonius\r\nLargus (86); Oribasius (Morb. Curat. iii, 56); Octavius Horatianus (i,\r\n28); Aëtius (xiv, 73); Actuarius (Meth. Med. vii, 8); Nonnus (224);\r\nAvicenna (iii, 22, 2, and iv, 3, 2); Haly Abbas (Pract. iv, 17); Rhases\r\n(Divis. 125); Alsaharavius (Pract. xxix, i, 27.)\r\n\r\nThese affections of the extremities Celsus recommends, in the first\r\nplace, to be bathed with hot water in which rapes or vervain have been\r\nboiled. If ulceration has not taken place, copper, as hot as possible,\r\nis to be applied to the part. If ulcerated, equal proportions of alum\r\nand frankincense, with wine, or pomegranate-rind, boiled in water and\r\npounded, are to be applied.\r\n\r\nThe following application, recommended by Scribonius, might be useful:\r\nCerussæ, lb. j; ol. myrtei, lb. j; lithargyri, dr. xxiv; ceræ Ponticæ,\r\nlb. j. Cerussa et spuma argenti coquuntur cum oleo, donec coeant, postea\r\nadjicitur cera.\r\n\r\nFor pernio, Aëtius gives a long list of applications, several of which\r\nare copied by our author. The ordinary ingredients of them are stimulants\r\nand astringents. The following may be pointed out as likely to be useful:\r\nAluminis scissi, dr. x; lithargyri, dr. iv; myrrhæ, dr. j; ovorum\r\nalbumina duo; vino et oleo myrteo; m. Aëtius also gives a variety of\r\nprescriptions for fissures and the other complaints of the feet.\r\n\r\nThe turnip is mentioned by Pliny as an application to chilblains. See\r\nalso Galen (de Optima Secta, 16.)\r\n\r\nOctavius Horatianus lays down very judicious rules for the treatment of\r\nthese complaints. His applications, however, are much the same as our\r\nauthor’s. Thus, for chilblains, he recommends fomentations with salt\r\nwater, or the decoction of beet, containing also alum; after which the\r\npart is to be anointed with melted wax. He also mentions, as proper\r\napplications, galls pounded with vinegar; a mixture of wax and melted\r\npitch; a cataplasm of boiled lentils; the grease of geese, with wax\r\nand oil, applied in a tepid state; and the like. When ulcerated, he\r\ndirects us to apply an ointment of litharge and axunge. For fissures he\r\nparticularly recommends liquid pitch; or litharge mixed with ceruse,\r\nalum, and wine. When hairs are troublesome, they are to be cleared away\r\nwith a fine piece of iron.\r\n\r\nFor fissures Rhases recommends the fat of a cock with galls. Alsaharavius\r\nlays down the rules for treating chilblains in all their stages with\r\ngreat precision. If the parts become red or black, he recommends us to\r\nmake deep scarifications with a scalpel; after which the foot is to be\r\nput into hot water and allowed to bleed freely. His dressings are similar\r\nto those of the others. Haly’s treatment is like our author’s.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXX.—FOR CORNS AND CALLOUS FLESH.\r\n\r\nHaving first cleaned the corns, apply one of the septics, either\r\nverdigris, red arsenic, the powder for fistulæ, or the collyrium for\r\nfistulæ instead of gum mixed with ammoniac. A corn is a white circular\r\nbody like the head of a nail, forming in all parts of the body, but\r\nmore especially on the soles of the feet and toes. It may be removed in\r\nthe course of some time by paring away the prominent part of the corn\r\nconstantly with a scalpel, or rubbing it down with pumice. The same thing\r\nmay be done with callus. The ashes of unripe lupines burnt, and mixed\r\nwith honey, are of use; or misy added to liquid pitch; or gith, with the\r\nurine of a boy not come to puberty; or bean-meal boiled with vinegar.\r\nAnd this is an application of approved efficacy for the same purpose: Of\r\ncantharides, of copperas, of castor, equal parts; mix with turpentine\r\nuntil it become of the consistence of a plaster, and apply to the corn\r\npreviously cleaned all around.—_Another_: Of burnt lees of wine, of\r\nquicklime, of mistletoe, equal parts, with strained lye, or the urine of\r\na boy not come to puberty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Aëtius delivers the treatment of corns fully, but his\r\nremedies, although similar to those of our author, are not of such ready\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nCelsus says that, by simply paring corns, the part may often be softened.\r\nAfterwards rosin mixed with a small quantity of the lapis molaris may be\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nAvicenna states that, when the disease is not cured, it may end in\r\ncancer. Marcellus directs us to pare corns, and apply to them a\r\ncomposition of arsenic and turpentine rosin.\r\n\r\nFor corns Rhases recommends a composition of red arsenic, quicklime,\r\nquicksilver killed, with the ashes of acorns (_impure potash?_) and oil.\r\nHe also joins Galen in recommending a composition of cantharides and\r\narsenic. For the callus he recommends the juice of figs and of spurge.\r\n(Contin. xxxvi.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. LXXXI.—ON COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE NAILS; AND, FIRST, OF WHITLOW.\r\n\r\nWhitlow is an abscess forming about the root of the nail. When,\r\ntherefore, the whitlow is small and but commencing, galls with honey\r\nrepress it, and prevent the formation of an abscess; or the trochisk of\r\nMusa, or the Here, in water. When a preternatural growth of flesh has\r\ntaken place, the object is to consume and break it with things that are\r\nnot of a corrosive nature. The sordes of the ears and lycium are also\r\ngood for whitlows. When it suppurates, having opened it and evacuated\r\nthe fluid, soak a sponge in water, and apply; or apply a cataplasm of\r\nlentils pounded with water; or palm-plaster with wine; or green or dried\r\nroses macerated in water, and pounded; or dried barley-flour with water.\r\nThe flour of lupines mixed with honey, or wine and honey is good for\r\nwhitlow. For ulcerated whitlows: Of verdigris, of litharge, of each, dr.\r\niv; of sarcocolla, dr. iv; sprinkle of it what is sufficient, and apply\r\nexternally a tent and sponge out of wine. And the flesh must be separated\r\nfrom the nail all around.\r\n\r\n_On pterygia._ Pterygium is fungous flesh covering part of the nail,\r\nbeing caused by whitlow or the like; for which, sprinkle equal parts\r\nof arsenic and manna, and apply a tent out of wine and a sponge\r\nabove it.—_Another_: Of chalcitis, of the flakes of copper, of\r\npomegranate-rind, equal parts; add to a roasted fig and honey, first\r\nbathing the part with the decoction of the thickening matters put into\r\nointments; and clean away the part of the pterygium when dried up.\r\n\r\n_For pterygia of the toes in a putrid state, and for ulcers of the\r\npudendum._ Of frankincense, dr. j; of the scales of copper, dr. j;\r\nof scraped verdigris called _xyston_, dr. iv; of honey, one cyathus;\r\ntriturate in the sun until it become yellowish, and use upon a compress,\r\nhaving first bathed with wine.\r\n\r\n_A composition for quickly drying and curing pterygia._ Of burnt sori,\r\ndr. ij; of frankincense, dr. ij; of verdigris called _xyston_, dr. j:\r\nhaving triturated with honey, apply to the pterygia. It is useful for\r\nthe other malignant ulcers, and for lividity, and putridity of these\r\nparts.—_Another_: Add the flakes of copper to the flesh of dates, or\r\nof figs, and use.—_Another_: Having boiled and triturated pigeons’\r\ndung in must with fine polenta, apply warm. And the flakes sprinkled\r\nby themselves dry up pterygia. We must always raise and remove with\r\na scalpel the corner of the nail when it increases so as to hurt the\r\npterygium.\r\n\r\n_For bruised nails._ Apply a cataplasm of myrtle and the tender leaves of\r\npomegranate.\r\n\r\n_For bloody nails._ Mix fine flour with pitch, and apply.\r\n\r\n_To remove diseased nails._ Add triturated sulphur to axunge, and apply.\r\n\r\n_How to remove leprous nails._ Of mistletoe of the oak, of red arsenic,\r\nof fenugreek, of each, oz. ij; of cantharides, of deadly carrot, of\r\neach, oz. j; of vinegar, q. s.—_Another_: Of bee-glue, of Attic wax, of\r\nbitumen, of each, dr. ij; of native sulphur, dr. j. Let only so much\r\noil be added that it may not stain. In using it, warm and apply it to\r\nthe nails.—_Another_: Of liquid pitch, of wax, of colophonian rosin,\r\nof turpentine, of ammoniac perfume, of native sulphur, of aphronitrum,\r\nequal parts; evaporate until it does not stain.—_Another, from the works\r\nof Ruffus, for leprous nails_: Of cantharides, of native sulphur, of\r\ncopperas, of each, oz. ss; of liquid pitch, oz. ij: having made into a\r\nplaster, apply to the nail, removing it every third day.\r\n\r\n_Another for removing leprous nails without ulceration._ Of bitumen, of\r\narsenic, of red arsenic, of native sulphur, of each, dr. iv; add to rosin\r\nand use, removing it every seven days.—_Another_: Mixing the flour of\r\nbitter vetches with sheep’s gall, or sheep’s urine, use; or unslacked\r\nlime with oil; or Chian mastich with opobalsum; or mixing copperas and\r\nnative sulphur with mistletoe, spread what is sufficient on a skin, and\r\napply; or triturate stavesacre with vinegar and use; or of turpentine\r\nrosin, dr. j; of red arsenic, double the quantity; apply to the root\r\nof the nail, and bind carefully. When the nail falls off, apply the\r\nmyrtle-cerate, containing a small quantity of the composition from rosin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See most of the authorities referred to in Section LXXIX.\r\n\r\nAëtius and Oribasius treat whitlow upon the same plan as our author,\r\nnamely, by using cooling and astringent applications, such as galls,\r\nalum, and pomegranate-rind at the commencement; and after it has burst\r\nand fungous flesh has got up, by applying strong caustic and corrosive\r\nmedicines, such as arsenic, verdigris, quicklime, and the flakes of\r\ncopper. Neither of these authors, however, say anything about making\r\nan early incision of the part affected with whitlow, which must be\r\nconsidered a defect in their method of practice. Octavius Horatianus,\r\nhowever, seems to have had it in view to recommend an early opening, when\r\nhe says, “Si saniem sanè collegerit, locum pungis.” In fact, it is as\r\nsoon as the part becomes gorged with blood, and before the matter has had\r\ntime to be properly formed, that an opening should be made.\r\n\r\nAvicenna is exceedingly minute in his directions for treating whitlow.\r\nHe recommends at first the finger to be put into hot vinegar. Then\r\nvarious astringent and repellent applications are to be used, among other\r\ningredients containing camphor. These are afterwards to be changed for\r\nemollient and sedative applications prepared with opium. When matter\r\nforms, it is to be let out by a small opening. Haly Abbas recommends\r\nat first the seed of fleawort pounded in vinegar or snow, to cool and\r\ndeaden the sensibility of the part. When these do not answer, he advises\r\nsuppurative applications; and when the abscess does not open readily,\r\nhe approves of an incision with the edge of a lancet. When the pain is\r\nviolent and obstinate, he recommends opium, henbane, and vinegar to be\r\nadded to the applications. He mentions that Hippocrates recommends an\r\napplication of galls and vinegar for whitlow. Alsaharavius describes\r\nwhitlow by the name of _alcahas_. He recommends us to bleed at the\r\ncommencement, then to use a plaster of vinegar and opium, or a piece of\r\ncloth moistened in snow or cold water, and frequently changed, or to put\r\nthe finger into hot oil. If these means do not succeed, suppuration is to\r\nbe encouraged; and as soon as matter forms it is to be let out. Avenzoar\r\ndescribes a species of malignant whitlow, of which we have seen some few\r\ncases. He says it spreads up the hand, and occasions corruption of it. He\r\nrecommends free incision, and relates a case in which very bad effects\r\nresulted from neglecting this practice. (iii, 2, 37.) This is perhaps the\r\nsame disease that is described by Alsaharavius (Pract. xxix, 1, 25), and\r\nby Albucasis (Chir. i.)\r\n\r\nRhases says that common people put the finger into hot oil. He also\r\nrecommends hot vinegar and hot water. (Contin. xxxvi.)\r\n\r\nCelsus directs us to make an opening around _scabrous nails_, and then to\r\napply a composition consisting of red arsenic, nitre, common arsenic, and\r\nliquid pitch. Under the use of this application, the diseased nails fall\r\noff and healthy ones come in their place. Haly Abbas and Alsaharavius\r\nalso recommend applications containing arsenic. Alexander Aphrodisiensis\r\nmentions that leuce occurs more commonly on the hands than the feet,\r\nand in children rather than in adults. This arises, he says, from the\r\nfeet being more exercised than the hands, and from children eating more\r\nvoraciously than adults. (Probl. i, 146.) The compositions recommended in\r\nthe ‘Euporista’ of Dioscorides for leprous nails are arsenic and water,\r\nsandarach, quicklime, and burnt lees of wine with pitch, the juice of\r\nthapsia and mustard with vinegar, &c. See also M. M. v, 122.\r\n\r\n_For bruised nails_, Aëtius strongly commends a mixture of fossil salt\r\nwith water and oil. Avenzoar speaks of privet (alcanna) with olive-oil.\r\n\r\n_For bloody nails_, Nonnus recommends a mixture of verdigris and axunge.\r\n\r\nAvicenna, among other applications resembling those of the Greeks,\r\nrecommends a plaster of cypress-nuts and savin.\r\n\r\n_For pterygia_, Celsus, among other applications, makes mention of a\r\nmixture of arsenic, quicklime, and chalcitis, in equal proportions. If\r\nthis application fail, he directs us to use the actual cautery. Aëtius\r\nand Oribasius recommend the most powerful escharotics, such as verdigris,\r\nmisy, sori, chalcitis, and arsenic. These applications are mentioned\r\nlikewise by Rhases. (Contin. xxxvi.)\r\n\r\nPliny says of arsenic, “Tollit et pterygia digitorum,” &c. (H. N. xxxiv,\r\n56.)\r\n\r\n                              END OF VOL. I.\r\n\r\n                       PRINTED BY C. AND J. ADLARD,\r\n                            BARTHOLOMEW CLOSE.",
