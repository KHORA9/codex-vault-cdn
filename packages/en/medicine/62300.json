Variations\r\nin hyphenation and accents have been standardised but all other\r\nspelling and punctuation remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe book contains a number of decorative borders and separators. These\r\nhave been ignored.\r\n\r\nAnchors for footnotes 27 and 59 were missing and have been added in\r\nappropriate places.\r\n\r\nThe Orphean hymn in footnote 12 is in error. The correction is shown\r\nwith the footnote.\r\n\r\n(the act the Lesbian) in footnote 327 is erroneous but could be ‘to\r\nact ...’ or ‘the act of ...’ so remains uncorrected.\r\n\r\nIn footnote 382 “The word θηλείας even in the edition mentioned stands\r\nboth in text and margin as γρ. δειλίας.” makes little sense and has\r\nbeen altered to “The word θηλείας in the edition mentioned stands in\r\ntext; and in the margin as γρ. δειλίας.”\r\n\r\nThe footnotes are located at the end of the book.\r\n\r\nIn the main text, italics are represented thus _italic_, however this\r\nmarking indicates letter-spacing in Latin and Greek passages.

Needless to say the Book in no way\r\nappeals,—or is meant to appeal,—to the general reading public. It is\r\na book for Students and Specialists, as is recognized indeed by the\r\nconditions of the present publication, in a limited edition and at a\r\nhigh price.\r\n\r\nTo Historical Students and Medical Specialists alike it is of the\r\nhighest value and interest, and in many respects an indispensable\r\naddition to their Library. The object the Writer proposed to himself\r\nwas a History of Venereal Disease, to trace its existence, symptoms\r\nand incidence, from the earliest notices of its occurrence recorded\r\nin Literature onwards. This ambitious programme he has only partially\r\ncarried out in the present Work, which forms Part I. of the projected\r\nTreatise as a whole, and deals with the Disease under its various forms\r\nand successive manifestations throughout Antiquity. In it he devotes\r\nhis efforts to proving,—and we think with conclusive success,—the\r\nexistence, denied by so many, of the dread Disease in different\r\nshapes in Europe, Asia and Africa long before the Christian era, and\r\nall through the period of Classical Antiquity, scouting utterly, the\r\npopular theory of its first introduction at the end of the Fifteenth\r\nand beginning of the Sixteenth Centuries from America.\r\n\r\nWith this end in view the learned and laborious Author collects an\r\nenormous _apparatus criticus_ of quotations from Greek and Latin\r\nwriters, both in prose and verse, and this not merely from the\r\nbetter known authors of Antiquity, but equally from later and much\r\nless familiar sources. Obscure Erotic Writers, historical fragments,\r\nChristian Fathers,—all is fish that comes to his comprehensive, though\r\nnot undiscriminating, net; and probably there is not to be found in\r\nthe whole range of Scholarship so wide and complete a collection of\r\nhistorical and literary illustrations and allusions brought together\r\nwith the express purpose of throwing light on one special subject of\r\nenquiry.\r\n\r\nSuch in briefest outline is the scope and achievement of Dr.\r\nRosenbaum’s masterpiece. But brief as it is, it suffices to show to\r\nhow many classes of Students and Scientists the work appeals. First\r\nand foremost it is of direct service to Physicians in general and\r\nSpecialists in Venereal Disease in particular, to Enquirers into the\r\nproblems of Insanity and the morbid manifestations of a diseased brain,\r\nas well as to Anthropologists and all scientific observers of Humanity.\r\nOn another side, in virtue of its wealth of curious and recondite\r\nquotation, it is of the highest interest and attraction to Classical\r\nScholars and every Student of Antiquity and Ancient Literature; while\r\nmidway between these two categories, Students of Morals and Human\r\nInstitutions cannot possibly afford to neglect a storehouse of “human\r\ndocuments” so invaluable in the domain of their studies.\r\n\r\nEven to the general Historical Student, who without laying any claim to\r\nthe proud title of Specialist, is deeply interested in the conditions\r\nof human life on our planet in former days, and eager to enquire into\r\nall matters relating to the health and happiness of mankind, the Book\r\nhas a great deal to offer. Few things have more profoundly modified\r\nthese factors of human well-being than Venereal disease and its ravages\r\nin all ages; while any systematic enquiry into this most important\r\nsubject cannot fail to throw many side-lights,—lurid enough, but none\r\nthe less instructive,—on life and morals, social relations and sexual\r\naberrations, among different Peoples and at different Epochs. What can\r\nbe more interesting,—painful as the interest often is,—than much of the\r\ninformation here afforded, at first hand and from authentic citations\r\nof Ancient writers, of social and sexual habits and ideals, of strange\r\nrites and rituals and abominable practices, prevalent as well in\r\nthe free Republics of Greece as under the corrupt sway of the Roman\r\nEmperors.\r\n\r\nGreat and wonderful no doubt were the Communities of the Ancient world,\r\nbeautiful the fine flower of graceful living, and high the level of\r\nphilosophic and literary culture attained, consummate the artistic\r\nrelics they have left us; but what a seamy side this same Classical\r\nCivilization had to show,—what unspeakable abominations underlay its\r\nsocial life, what atrocities of foulness, cruelty and lust,—some of\r\nthem flourishing under the sanction of Religion itself,—counterbalanced\r\nthe virtues of wise citizenship and warlike valour and Stoic\r\nself-denial. Lurid and terrible indeed are some of the pictures of\r\nhorror that shape themselves from certain of Dr. Rosenbaum’s pages,—the\r\nwhole Section, for instance, in Vol. I. dealing with “Brothels and\r\nCourtesans”, and in an even higher degree that on “Paederastia” and the\r\ndiseases consequent on this unnatural practice. Specially graphic and\r\nvivid sections again, in Vol. II., are those treating of the practice\r\nof “Depilation” among Greeks and Romans, and the Baths and Bathing\r\nhabits of Antiquity.\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to the Medical and Anthropological aspects\r\nof the Work. Perhaps no single branch of Scientific Enquiry has\r\nmade such noteworthy strides of late years as Anthropology, and in\r\nparticular the special Department of that Science devoted to morbid\r\nand anomalous manifestations of the sexual appetite,—unnatural lusts,\r\nsensual aberrations, sexual inversions, and all the rest. The subject,\r\nno doubt, is repulsive, but it is none the less profoundly important\r\nfrom the scientific side, in connexion both with the general advance\r\nof our knowledge of Mankind, and with the special Study of Insanity\r\nand Madness, as well as from the humanitarian point of view as giving\r\nmaterial for the eventual alleviation of many of these manifestations\r\nof Mental Disease. Out of a host of names, it is only necessary to\r\nmention two, those of Lombroso and Krafft-Ebing, to demonstrate the\r\nhigh place these investigations have vindicated for themselves among\r\nthe scientific triumphs of the Century that has just closed. On this\r\nside the _Geschichte der Lustseuche_ is of the highest importance,\r\nsupplying as it does innumerable instances of those very phaenomena of\r\nmorbid sexual perversions that constitute the subject matter of this\r\nrapidly progressive branch of Science, one likely in the near future to\r\nprove of infinite benefit to afflicted humanity.\r\n\r\nOf the Author personally there is no need to say much, nor indeed\r\nis there much to be said. His life was quiet and uneventful, as a\r\nScholar’s and Savant’s should be. After holding a Professorship at\r\nBerlin, he was summoned to fill a similar post at the University of\r\nHalle, where he succeeded to the Chair left vacant by the death of the\r\ncelebrated Dr. Baumgarten-Crusius; and it was here that he completed\r\nhis great Work,—in spite of difficulties and lack of books, which he\r\nnaïvely and rather pathetically laments in his Preface. Halle had\r\nalready been made illustrious by an earlier and even more distinguished\r\nworker in the same field, the famous Sprengel (died March 15, 1833),\r\nauthor of a masterly _History of Medicine_ and many other professional\r\nworks; and with a characteristic touch of Teutonic sentimentality\r\nour Author dates the Preface to his own _Geschichte_ on Sprengel’s\r\nbirth-day.\r\n\r\nA by no means unimportant feature of Dr. Rosenbaum’s book, and one\r\naccording well with his patient and laborious methods, is the very\r\nextensive and valuable Bibliography, which will be found at the end of\r\nthe Work. This embraces almost everything that has been written on the\r\nsubject in all languages, and should prove of inestimable service to\r\nthe serious student.\r\n\r\nFor any errors that may have crept into his version, the Translator\r\nmust crave indulgence. Some such are inevitable, more particularly in\r\nthe renderings of the innumerable Latin and Greek quotations, many of\r\nwhich are involved in diction and obscure in allusion, and some of\r\ndisputed interpretation. The labour involved has been no small one,—the\r\nmere proof-reading itself being a heavy task in a book like the present\r\ncrammed with citations from several languages.\r\n\r\nFor the general appearance and get up of the Book, the Publisher, Mr.\r\nCharles Carrington, of Paris, is responsible, and his name, so well\r\nknown in connection with the production of Medical and Scientific works\r\nof this kind, is a sufficient guarantee of excellence.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Translator offers with confidence the result of his\r\nlabours to all Englishmen interested as Specialists in the History of\r\nMedicine, in Anthropology and the Scientific Study of Insanity, as\r\nalso in Classical Scholarship and the Study of Antiquity and Ancient\r\nLiterature, as well as to Enquirers generally into the History of\r\nMorals and the life and life conditions of earlier days. In doing\r\nso, he feels sure of a favourable reception for so important and\r\nscholarly a Work, throwing such a flood of light on all these different\r\ndepartments of study.\r\n\r\nOXFORD, June 14, 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            DR. ROSENBAUM’S\r\n\r\n                 PREFACE TO THE FIRST (GERMAN) EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AUTHOR’S PREFACE\r\n\r\n                                TO THE\r\n\r\n                        FIRST (GERMAN) EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now six years ago, during my residence in Berlin, and with a\r\nview to a historical Survey of miliary fevers, that I began a closer\r\nand more systematic study of the Epidemics of the XVth. and XVIth.\r\nCenturies. In the course of these enquiries my attention was inevitably\r\ndirected to the subject of Venereal disease, which exerted so powerful\r\nan influence at that epoch both on the physical and the moral life of\r\nnations. Accustomed as I was to regard History as being something more\r\nthan a mere quasi-mechanical aggregation of facts, the observation\r\nwas soon borne in upon me that only through a painstaking examination\r\nof the contemporary conditions of epidemic disease could the Venereal\r\nDisease of the period be really understood. Consequently I felt I must\r\nisolate this terrible scourge of humanity from the general survey,—so\r\ngeneral as to be well-nigh all-embracing,—and consider it as a\r\nphænomenon apart.\r\n\r\nOnce started on these lines, I occupied myself specially with the\r\nsubject, and arrived at the surprising result, that the Venereal\r\nDisease of the XVth. Century owed its terrible characteristics solely\r\nand entirely to the contemporary exanthematic-typhoïdal _Genius\r\nEpidemicus_, which made itself known in the South of Europe by\r\npetechial fevers and by the _Sudor Anglicus_ (English Sweating-fever)\r\nin the North. I concluded further that the disease was not epidemic\r\nat all, merely liable to arise under epidemic influence; and must\r\nconsequently have been already extant before the arrival of the said\r\n_Genius Epidemicus_.\r\n\r\nTime and circumstances compelled me to remain satisfied provisionally\r\nwith this general conclusion, and only after I had fixed my abode\r\npermanently at Halle, could I resume my earlier investigations. Yet\r\nagain these were interrupted, partly by my work on the Diseases of the\r\nSkin for the Dictionary of Surgery edited by Prof. Blasius, partly by\r\nmy Habilitation (formal entry on the Staff) at the University of that\r\nplace, to which I had been repeatedly invited after the unexpected\r\ndeath of the late Dr. Baumgarten-Crusius. Eventually I was enabled\r\nto devote the greater part of my leisure hours to this subject, one\r\nwhich in the meantime was never quite lost sight of. I began to sift\r\nand arrange the material I found accumulated, but in a short time I\r\nconvinced myself that in its treatment I had to strike out a different\r\nroad from that followed hitherto, if I ever intended on my own\r\naccount to reach important results; and I felt it would be impossible\r\nto complete the whole Survey in a single moderate-sized volume.\r\nConsequently I proceeded to limit myself to the enquiry whether or\r\nno Venereal disease had been extant in Ancient times, and it is this\r\ninvestigation that I now publish as a first Part of the History of\r\nVenereal disease.\r\n\r\nThe general plan I have followed in my treatment of the subject is\r\nsufficiently explained in the Introduction; while a perusal of the text\r\nwill show in what relation my investigations stand towards those of\r\nmy predecessors, and at the same time to what extent these have been\r\nmade use of, or indeed could be made use of, in my work. Owing to the\r\nvery nature of the subject the Survey as a whole was bound to assume\r\na critical character, dealing as it does not solely with the history\r\nof the Disease, but also with the examination of an extensive array of\r\nviews and opinions already formulated. The conduct of this examination\r\nI leave the reader to judge of; but I believe I can confidently assert\r\nit was always the matter, never the man, that I subjected to critical\r\ntreatment. Accordingly I laid little stress on brilliant results, and\r\nmade no effort to conceal lack of facts by dazzling hypotheses; instead\r\nI made it my supreme object to come at the truth as near as possible,\r\nand preferred to confess my ignorance, if the helps and authorities\r\nI had at my disposal failed me, rather than advance propositions the\r\nbaselessness of which a sober criticism is only too soon in a position\r\nto demonstrate.\r\n\r\n“I imposed this law on myself—to believe no man’s mere assertion; to\r\ndepend on original authorities; to look at every passage with my own\r\neyes, and read it in connexion with its context; to pick out the plain\r\nfact observed from the Chaos of hypotheses, and to accept as exact\r\nonly what I could deduce from the authorities myself and see to be\r\nthe evident purport of the observation,—absolutely unconcerned how\r\neach arbitrary theory might be affected or the sacrosanct authority\r\nof such or such a Scholar stand or fall. Why should we deem great men\r\ninfallible? why find it impossible to honour them and yet dissent\r\nfrom them in opinion?—I felt I owed to my reader a corresponding\r\nimpartiality in statement of the facts and arguments based upon them.\r\nIf I was determined to take nothing on trust, but to examine and see\r\nfor myself, I could not reasonably demand faith from the reader and\r\nrefuse to communicate to him the proofs and original documents I had\r\ndrawn upon. It was no case of mere quotation from books,—I was bound\r\nto lay open the original evidence for his inspection.” These words of\r\nHensler’s I took as my guiding-principle, and if I have deviated from\r\ntheir standard in the Third Section, this only happened because the\r\ngreater part of the passages there quoted have been repeatedly handled\r\nby my predecessors, and I feared to increase the bulk and consequently\r\nthe cost of the Book to the prejudice of the reader.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that the method I have adopted hardly corresponds\r\nwith the taste of the present day; and if the public choose to find\r\nin my work nothing but an idle display of quotations, I cannot fail\r\nto be mortified. Nevertheless I prefer to encounter, if needs be, the\r\nreproach of pedantry rather than that of superficiality. With the\r\ndifficulties I met with in connection with particular investigations I\r\nneed not trouble the reader at greater length, as they are sufficiently\r\nfamiliar to everyone engaged in similar researches. I may be allowed\r\nto point out what a task was presented by the co-ordination of so\r\nconsiderable a number of scattered data. These I had, in the almost\r\ntotal absence of earlier works on the same subject, to collect mostly\r\nby my own reading from very widely separated Authors; and anything like\r\nsymmetry of arrangement was made still more difficult when, as occurred\r\nmore than once, the discovery of a single passage forced me to entirely\r\nre-write a substantial part of my manuscript, often within a short\r\ntime of its going to Press. For the same reason the indulgent reader\r\nmust excuse it, if here and there a later observation involves the\r\nsupplementing and in some degree correcting of a previous statement,—a\r\nthing that would have been done much more frequently, had I not dreaded\r\ntreating my material in too rambling a fashion. It would be quite easy\r\nnow to subjoin in the form of appendices a multitude of additional\r\nproofs, of course only corroborating views already laid down,—proofs\r\nI owed to further reading of the Ancient authors. However absolute\r\ncompleteness is impossible of attainment for the individual; and I can\r\nonly hope the humble request I hereby express,—a request addressed\r\nspecially to professional students of Antiquity,—that others may favour\r\nme with contributions and remarks relevant to my subject, may be not\r\nentirely without result. So later on perhaps the material accumulated\r\nmay be utilised more efficiently, if the interest manifested by\r\nthe learned in my undertaking is of such a nature as to demand a\r\nre-modelling of the whole Investigation.\r\n\r\nThe necessity I found myself under of expressing this request for\r\ncountenance on the part of students of Antiquity is the very thing\r\nthat specially induced me to strongly recommend the First Part of my\r\nwork, even on its Title-page, to their particular consideration; and it\r\nwill be a source of self-congratulation if the attempts incidentally\r\nintroduced to gain a better insight into the relics of Antiquity,\r\nmeeting with their approval, become an inducement to the Physician in\r\nhis professional studies to offer a helping hand to human weaknesses.\r\nThe question at issue is nothing less than that of gaining a clear\r\ninsight into the nature and origin of the operation of a Disease that\r\ndestroys the very marrow of Nations. Without such insight the Physician\r\ncannot hope, whether in the particular case or speaking generally,\r\nto obtain a radical cure; and of all forms of Disease the Venereal\r\nis pre-eminently that where obscurity in the history of the malady\r\nconditions obscurity in its curative treatment. For the first time it\r\nis successfully proved with irrefragable certainty that the Ancients\r\nwere infested with this _morbus mundanus_ (World-disease) just as\r\nmuch as the Moderns. Honourable nations are freed from the shameful\r\nreproach of fathering this Complaint; and at the same time Physicians\r\nsee themselves forced to seek a reason for the untrustworthiness they\r\nrecognise at the present day as belonging to the so-called “Specifics”,\r\nnot in the nature of these remedies, but in the changes which the\r\nDisease has undergone under external influences. Moreover they will\r\nfind that the non-mercurial treatment nowadays so highly extolled is\r\nfar from being the mere creature of fashion; rather it is the direct\r\nconsequence of the alteration in the common and universal _genius_ of\r\nthe Complaint, which appears at this moment to be again tending to a\r\ngradual disappearance. The grounds for this assertion I have already\r\nmore than once explained to my hearers in my repeated Lectures on\r\nVenereal Disease; and I propose to communicate them fully in the Second\r\nPart of my History of the Disease, framed on the same principles as the\r\nFirst.\r\n\r\nWhen I shall publish this Second Part, if ever, will depend first\r\non the reception of the preceding volume; secondly on whether\r\nmore favourable external conditions provide the leisure that is\r\nindispensably necessary for Historical investigations of the sort, and\r\nat the same time put at my disposal a more complete literary apparatus\r\nthan has hitherto been the case. For historico-medical studies in\r\ngeneral there exists hardly a more unfavourable[1] place than Halle;\r\nand this is specially and peculiarly so with regard to epidemic\r\ndiseases. As far as Venereal Disease is concerned the whole literary\r\nwealth of our University Library amounts to something like ten or\r\ntwelve Works, half of which are all but worthless. I myself shrank from\r\nno expense to obtain possession of the literary helps required, and\r\nmy collections, particularly on the subject of Epidemics, might boast\r\nof being not inferior to those of any private individual; yet they\r\nare quite insufficient for my purpose, so much, especially from the\r\nearlier Centuries, being no longer procurable by way of purchase.\r\n\r\nBut when all that is extant in writing is procured, the business is\r\nstill far from being done. I am still in want of quite a formidable\r\narray of facts that can only be the fruit of observations in more\r\nrecent times. For this reason may I appeal to my elder professional\r\nbrethren, and above all to the different medical Unions and\r\nAssociations at home and abroad with the request that they will,\r\nwhether directly or indirectly, help me to the possession of the facts\r\nin question. Such are in particular facts concerning the influence of\r\nthe _Genius Epidemicus_ on the different forms or Venereal Disease,\r\nand first and foremost it behoves me to learn—_what influence Typhus\r\nmanifested during the first fifteen years of this Century, particularly\r\nsince 1811, in different Countries_. That such an influence, and a\r\ndisastrous one, _did_ take place is evidenced not only by the 364\r\npp. of collected Authorities, but also by the data of the brilliant\r\nSACHS in his “Concise Dictionary of Practical Therapeutics”, II. Pt.\r\n1. (Article: Guajac) p. 637. To my sorrow I have only just, since\r\nthe appearance of the Index to that valuable Work, become acquainted\r\nwith these data, which appealed to me all the more from the fact that\r\nthroughout they corroborate the results reached by myself in the\r\nhistorical sphere.\r\n\r\nSACHS, and so far as I know he was the first to express this opinion\r\nopenly, holds as a fully established conclusion that the Venereal\r\nDisease of the XVth. Century owed the characteristics it then possessed\r\nmerely to the prevailing _Genius epidemicus typhodes_; though at the\r\nsame time I cannot favour his assumption of a leprous-syphilitic\r\nDiathesis (general condition of body) as already existent. Nothing is\r\nbetter fitted to give a clear insight into these earlier conditions\r\nthan a knowledge of the period of the Thirty Years’ War and of the\r\nTyphus epidemics at the beginning of the present Century. Would it had\r\nhappened to any of those heroes of the healing art who played an active\r\npart in the great Drama of that time to have crowned his day’s-work\r\nby leaving us a more detailed medical recital of the incidents. The\r\nnumber of men qualified for the task grows daily fewer, the possibility\r\nof gathering the material required daily harder of realization; and,\r\nthough it is not so yet, the work may later on be impracticable[2].\r\n\r\nIn conclusion—may I be allowed hereby to offer my sincere thanks to\r\nall who in any way have granted me active support in the course my\r\nenquiries. I should be glad to give their names, did I not fear they\r\nmight dislike seeing themselves recorded in connection with a History\r\nof Venereal Disease. In spite of this scruple I feel compelled to make\r\nan exception in the case of one of them, viz. my friend, Dr. ECKSTEIN,\r\nHeadmaster of the Royal High-School (Pädagogium) of Halle. He shared\r\nwith me the exceedingly laborious duty of correcting the proofs; and\r\nboth myself and my readers into the bargain owe him a debt of warmest\r\ngratitude for so doing.\r\n\r\nWritten on the birth-day of C.

Consult experience,—in other\r\nwords enquire what has been usually understood under the name History\r\nof a Disease, and you find to be included in the idea,—first, a more or\r\nless complete chronological comparison of the different observations\r\nand views of different Physicians at different times on such or such\r\na Disease, secondly, a survey of the course of the Disease in the\r\nindividual case. The first is properly only a history of the opinions\r\nof Physicians, the History of the Literature so to speak of the\r\nDisease, which must come before the _actual_ History, while the latter\r\nis nothing else than a history of a Disease in a single instance, that\r\nis to say the history of a particular case of disease, the history\r\nof individual patients; and this we have long been in the habit of\r\nreckoning a part of Clinics.\r\n\r\nNay, the _sum_ of such clinical histories if taken all together will\r\nnot help us to the actual history of a Disease, so long as they merely\r\ngive an account of the visible symptoms by which the disease makes its\r\npresence known. By this means we shall be learning merely the ideal\r\ncourse of the Malady, getting a pictorial representation of it such\r\nas is demanded by Pathological specialists,—as it were the _internal_\r\nhistory of the Disease. We cannot write the history of a single Man or\r\nof a single Nation so as to be a sufficient basis for the understanding\r\nand right appreciation of them, if we grasp only their inner history,\r\nthat of their _internal_ development, and consequently view them by\r\nthemselves as a something separated off from all surroundings, instead\r\nof bearing in mind as we should the forms their relations take to\r\nenvironment, to the outer world generally,—in fact their _external_\r\nhistory. Similarly we are just as little in a position to furnish the\r\nhistory of a _Disease_, if we include in the matter of our enquiry only\r\nthe course of the disease and not its external relations as well.\r\n\r\nIt is only the inner genetic co-ordination of the two, viz. the\r\ninternal and the external history (for Disease has also an external\r\nhistory) that can conduct to the _actual History_ of the Disease.\r\nThis may be defined as _a genetic co-ordination and statement of the\r\nsymptoms of a Disease under different conditions and in different\r\nindividuals, from the first moment at which they arose and came under\r\nobservation down to the time when the report is made_; or, expressed\r\nmore briefly, the History of a Disease is _a genetic co-ordination and\r\naccount of its development and progress in time_ (as conditioned by\r\ntime). Supposing Time, Relations, and Number of individuals definitely\r\nlimited, a Special History is the result; while the General History\r\nof a Disease properly speaking can _never_ be viewed as isolated from\r\nits surroundings. In that case the conditions on which the generation\r\nand origin of the particular Disease depend would necessarily cease\r\nentirely and for ever to exist.\r\n\r\nNow if we analyse the conception of the History of a Disease into its\r\ncomponent parts, we shall get to know its special _contents_, the\r\nefficient factors of which it is compounded, and which the Historian\r\nhas to comprehend and express. The function of History is to exhibit\r\nsomething that has happened; naturally therefore the first thing the\r\nHistorian must do is to look out for the point of time at which the\r\nprocess of change began. But certain generating factors and influences\r\nare indispensable to every process of change, and their activity again\r\nis dependent on certain favourable external conditions; and so it\r\nbecomes the next duty of the Historian to authenticate the existence\r\nof the said favourable influences as well as of the generating\r\nfactors, and concurrently to determine in what manner they came into\r\nactive operation. Inasmuch as it happens however sometimes that the\r\ninterposing or favouring as well as the generative factors are known to\r\nbe present, and yet no outbreak of disease occurs, so far as we see, or\r\nonly an incompletely developed one, those influences also will require\r\nauthentication which hindered or modified the potential activity of the\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\nOnly after all this has been systematically and sufficiently analyzed,\r\nwill it become possible to trace the development and course of\r\nthe Disease itself and to mark the successive changes offered to\r\nobservation from its first appearance to the time when its history\r\nwas recorded. Now these changes are imposed upon it either by its own\r\nproper nature or from outside, and so the Historian must explain also\r\nthe internal and external relations involved. Again in any individual\r\ncase the various manifestations or signs of a Disease by no means\r\nappear all together at one time, but rather develope in a series; so in\r\nthe _general_ course of a Disease, as recorded historically, a similar\r\ncontinuous series of symptoms will be more or less clearly noticeable,\r\nyet without implying that it is dependent solely on external\r\nconditions. Further, as every Disease is liable at any given time to\r\ncome into conflict with another, the Historian will in this case also\r\nhave to point out, what forms the relations of either took at the\r\nmoment, whether the disease in question showed itself as determining\r\nthe other or was itself determined by it, whether it consented to enter\r\ninto combinations, whether it led to the annihilation of its adversary\r\nor was itself annihilated, or whether lastly both remained in a manner\r\nneutral. Finally account must be taken of the influence of medical aid,\r\nand generally of the relation of the Physician to the Disease.\r\n\r\nThese different points once successfully and in a competent manner\r\nco-ordinated into a kind of organic connexion, the resulting History\r\nof Disease, a clinical History, yet as wide as humanity itself, will\r\nsupply the most momentous factor towards an insight into the nature and\r\nessence of Disease. It will not merely afford the theoretical enquirer\r\nthe necessary materials for his speculations as to Disease in general\r\nand systems of treatment, but also teach the practical Physician the\r\nconditions of a rational method of Therapeutics; and will consequently\r\nbe equally interesting, and what is more, equally needful to both. Such\r\nan organic connexion can only be established on the condition that\r\nthe Historian calls to remembrance step by step, as he proceeds, the\r\nsciences of Physiology and Pathology. Only by their help is it possible\r\nalways and everywhere to mark the inner necessity of the relation of\r\ncause and effect and to distinguish the essential from the accidental.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Possibility of the History of a Disease in General and of Venereal\r\n                        Disease in Particular.\r\n\r\nHaving learned the Conception and proper Contents of the History of a\r\nDisease, we naturally proceed to another closely connected question,—do\r\nall Diseases admit of such a historical exposition? It may be taken\r\nfor granted at the outset with tolerable certainty that the answer to\r\nthis question will be affirmative for the majority of actual Diseases;\r\nat any rate hardly an objection can be alleged from the theoretical\r\nstand-point. At the same time practical Experience must be allowed a\r\nvoice on this point.\r\n\r\nUnhappily we gain but little that is comforting from experience. It can\r\nscarcely be said that even a beginning has been made so far towards\r\nwriting the History of a Disease in the indicated sense; and besides\r\nthis, diseases have been primarily selected for consideration in which\r\nthe historical factor obtrudes itself, as it were, on the attention, to\r\nwit the epidemic diseases. For the rest hardly anything at all has been\r\ndone, excepting only in the case of Leprosy and the Venereal Disease,\r\nfor which with singular unanimity an epidemic character has always been\r\nclaimed. The Proteus-like character of these Maladies hindered every\r\nattempt of speculation to penetrate their nature, and so enquirers\r\nsaw themselves forced to consult History. But the merest superficial\r\nglance at the treatment of Venereal disease by its Historians (and\r\nthis applies equally to Leprosy) will show that little more than an\r\ninsufficient collection of materials towards an actual History of the\r\ndisease has thus far seen the light; and this in spite of the fact that\r\nno contemptible number of the most distinguished Scholars have devoted\r\ntime and trouble to the subject, in many cases making it their life’s\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the matter is looked into more closely, it will be evident\r\nthat a large proportion of these scholars directed their attention to\r\none single point only, viz. the antiquity and time of origin of the\r\nDisease; and regarded all the other factors only in so far as they\r\nsupported one or other of the views they had formulated. Besides the\r\nco-ordination of these factors is seen to be so loose that no general\r\nresult of any stringency could ever be obtained. The few men whose\r\ndefinite purpose it was to arrive at such a result, failed, in view of\r\nthe difficulty of collecting the material, to reach the completeness\r\nthey had proposed, and so deferred working up what they had accumulated\r\ntill death put an end to their enterprise. In especial this was the\r\ncase with _Hensler_, and the non-appearance of the Second Part of his\r\nHistory of the Venereal Disease must doubtless long continue to be\r\nmourned as an irreparable loss.\r\n\r\nThe Past, on which all experience must draw, affords us so little\r\nassistance here that it is to the Future we must look for everything.\r\nThe Present cannot show us in existence any history of Venereal disease\r\nas we understand it, but this in no way entitles it to deny the\r\npossibility of such a History. Thus it is of the highest importance\r\nto make the attempt to arrange and sift the material now ready and\r\naccessible, so far as it concerns the Venereal Disease, on principles\r\nconformable to the Conception and proper Contents as indicated above\r\nof the History of a Disease, and for this a relative completeness of\r\nthe collected materials suffices. If in this way we are successful in\r\nsketching the history of Venereal Disease at any rate in its general\r\noutlines, it can quite well be left to the continued efforts of\r\nother Investigators to fill in the individual lines of the picture,\r\nespecially as then and then only is the particular point ascertained by\r\nanticipation, at which later accessions must be worked in.\r\n\r\nIn every History, what comes first and foremost is to get to know the\r\noriginal Authorities from which the material for its treatment can be\r\ndrawn, and this forms the proper Contents of the _Literary_ history\r\nof the Disease. Accordingly our first duty will be to give a general\r\nsurvey of the literary helps lying ready to hand for the use of the\r\nHistorian of Venereal Disease, and at the same time to specify how far\r\nthese were accessible to ourselves. Thus the reader will be enabled\r\nat the very outset to form a judgement as to the completeness of the\r\ninformation supplied; and succeeding Enquirers will learn the gaps that\r\nare left remaining for them to fill up.\r\n\r\nThis will conclude a Survey of the historical results so far obtained\r\nin connection with the antiquity and time of origin of the Disease; and\r\nit will then be possible to indicate the special Scheme we propose to\r\nfollow in our treatment of the task before us.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract of Opinions advanced at various Periods on the question of the\r\n           Antiquity and First Rise of the Venereal Disease.\r\n\r\nThe different Opinions advanced at various periods on the question of\r\nthe Antiquity and Origin of the Venereal Disease may at the outset be\r\nbrought under two main divisions, according as the disease is supposed\r\nto have been already known to the Ancients and from their time onwards\r\nto have been continuously observed, _or_ on the other hand regarded as\r\nhaving first arisen in the ninetieth year of the XVth. Century. Both\r\nviews were framed much about the same time, and depended largely on the\r\nposition and education of the person delivering judgement. The former\r\nmay be styled the view of the learned, the latter the popular view,\r\nthough indeed at their first inception it was not so much scientific\r\nreasons in either case as men’s prejudices that formed their basis.\r\n\r\nThe few really learned Physicians of the end of XVth. Century and\r\nbeginning of the XVIth. took as the theme of their study not Nature but\r\nrather the medical Writings of the Greeks and Arabians, a field that\r\nhad long been left unappropriated by them, and all were far too firmly\r\nconvinced, that _Hippocrates_, and still more _Galen_ and _Avicenna_\r\nhad already included in their Works everything that could ever be the\r\nsubject of scientific treatment at any given time.\r\n\r\nAttention was concentrated upon the Skin Affection that was the\r\npredominant form at first, and this was naturally enough taken for a\r\nkind of Leprosy, and called sometimes Elephantiasis (_Seb. Aquilanus_,\r\n_Phil. Beroaldus_), sometimes “Formica” (_Schellig_, _Cumanus_,\r\n_Gilinus_, _Leonicenus_, _Steber_), by others “Saphat” (_J. Widmann_,\r\n_Nat. Montesaurus_, _Jul. Tanus_, _Jo. de Fogueda_, _Sim. Pistor_).\r\nHence the view advanced subsequently by _Sydenham_, _Haller_, _Plenk_,\r\n_Thierry_, _Haward_, and held for a time by _Sprengel_, that the\r\noriginal form of the Venereal Disease was the “Yaws” or “Piana”, and\r\nconsequently that Africa must be assigned as the original home of the\r\ndisease; and in this way the Moors also were brought in as part of the\r\nconcatenation. Later on, when the conviction grew up that the beginning\r\nof the Disease consists in local affections of the genital organs,\r\nit was easy to show that these had always been in existence from the\r\nmost ancient times. But as no direct information on the relation\r\nbetween affections of the Genitals and Skin-disease was to be found in\r\nthe earlier Writers, enquirers were driven to the supposition, that\r\nSyphilitic affections of the Skin had been confounded by the Ancients\r\nwith Leprosy.\r\n\r\nA view, which _Becket_ first sought to establish on precise grounds,\r\nappeared on the contrary too bold to other investigators, who thought\r\nto find some way of evading it. This was to the effect that Leprosy\r\nunder favourable conditions had changed into Venereal Disease, and\r\nthe increased rarity of the former seemed to speak for this opinion.\r\nSupporters of this last view are in especial _Sprengel_ and _Choulant_\r\nin his Preface to Fracastori’s “Syphilis”. Whilst the particular home\r\nof the Disease was fixed in this way by some authors, _Swediaur_ and\r\n_Beckman_ thought to find it in the East Indies, and held that the\r\n“Dschossam”, a familiar Indian disease, or else the “Persian Fire”\r\nmust be looked upon as the original form of the Complaint. _Schaufus_\r\nagreed with them in part; he believed Venereal disease to have been\r\nbrought by the Gypsies from India to Europe. _Dr. Wizmann_[3] made\r\nthe disease arise in the IInd. Century in Dacia, which at that date\r\nwas transformed into a Roman Colony and had to welcome the licentious\r\nRoman soldiery. The excesses of these colonists, in a strange climate,\r\nand seconded by a combination of conditions favourable to epidemic\r\nsickness, produced the disease, which he says is generated to this\r\nday in its genuine form in Turkey. Accordingly _Wizmann_, as also\r\n_Sprengel_ and _Choulant_, and to some extent _Gruner_, who considered\r\nthe Moors to be the parents of the Venereal disease, may be regarded as\r\ntaking up an intermediate position between the two extreme views, and\r\nas making a sort of transition to the opinions of those who look upon\r\nthe Disease as a new one.\r\n\r\nThe special supporters of this view were, as mentioned above, the\r\nnon-medical, though a considerable number of men calling themselves\r\nPhysicians agreed with them, though on other grounds, differing only\r\nas to the mode in which the Disease arose. The prevailing astrological\r\nviews found the original cause of the Disease in the Conjunction of\r\nthe Planets, a conjunction declared beforehand by prophecy to bode\r\ndisaster. With this were included as contributing to the effect\r\nInundations, the oppressed condition of Nations, Famine and the\r\nlike. The disease was called an epidemic, or what at that period was\r\npractically synonymous, a pestilential disease, a Plague, and ascribed\r\nof course to the wrath of God. There were other accounts given, that\r\nstill carry some show of probability; the Disease was referred to the\r\npoisoning of wells and of wine (Caesalpinus), to the admixture of\r\ngypsum with the flour (Fallopia), or actually to indulgence in human\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\nWhen coition could no longer be denied as an interposing factor, rumour\r\nresorted to all sorts of wild tales, the copulation of a courtesan with\r\na Leper, copulation with animals, and particularly with asses, and\r\nfinally with the voluptuous Indian women of America. From the latter\r\nstory grew up by degrees the theory of the American origin of Venereal\r\nDisease, which found its chief supporters in _Astruc_ and _Girtanner_,\r\nand in spite of Hensler’s exertions seems even yet not absolutely\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     General Scheme of Treatment.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes important to consider more closely these various views,\r\nas well as the reasons advanced for them, and to subject them to\r\nexamination. But as the result of this examination will cover to some\r\nextent the same ground as the formal History, it will be expedient to\r\ntreat the two as far as possible in connection with one another. By\r\nthis method it will _ipso facto_ appear how far the individual views\r\nare tenable, and how far the grounds alleged in their favour valid. And\r\nthis is all the more necessary for two reasons, first because by this\r\nmeans a host of repetitions is avoided, secondly because only in this\r\nway are such gaps as still remain clearly recognised and made tangible.\r\n\r\nAll the different views fall, as already stated, into two groups,\r\naccording as they maintain the antiquity or the modernness of the\r\nVenereal Disease. In conformity with this division we must separate\r\nour investigation from the outset into two parts, of which Part I is\r\nto comprise the Venereal Disease in Antiquity, Part II the Venereal\r\nDisease to the end of the XVth. Century. To this will be added further\r\nas a Third Part, the History of the Disease down to our own day.\r\n\r\nEach of the two earlier Parts will open, in accordance with the views\r\ndeclared above, with a statement and examination of the Authorities.\r\n\r\nAfter that will follow an investigation of the influences that evoked\r\ndiseases as a consequence of the use or misuse of the Genital organs\r\nand are favourable to their genesis, as well as those influences\r\ncapable of staying, or in the case of diseases already established,\r\nmodifying their progress. The difficulty of such an investigation is as\r\nstriking as is its necessity; for on this subject there is an almost\r\ntotal lack of previous Works of any use to consult; and yet it is only\r\nby their help we can possibly win a deeper insight into the history of\r\nVenereal Disease.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of medical Science in face of these influences and their\r\nconsequences will next claim our attention, so far as it is competent\r\nto exert a determining and modifying effect on the form and character\r\nof the Disease. In this connection it is especially important to\r\ndetermine whether the Physicians correctly diagnosed these diseases for\r\nwhat they are, or generally speaking had any opportunity of doing so.\r\n\r\nHaving come to a clear understanding, as far as is possible, on\r\nall these points, we shall then be in a position to give a genetic\r\nexposition of the development of the Disease itself. This will form the\r\nconclusion of each separate part, as well as of the whole Work; and\r\nthen and then only we shall be able to say our task is fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE PLAGUE OF LUST IN CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY.\r\n\r\n                              FIRST PART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AUTHORITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Antiquity we find that for a considerable length of time the medical\r\nsciences were far from being confined to a distinct profession, and\r\nfurther, where this does seem to be the case, there is always a not\r\ninsignificant proportion of such knowledge that comes to us merely\r\nas popular or traditional Medicine. It is therefore evident, that if\r\nwe would gain definite information as to the existence of a Disease\r\namong the Ancients, we ought by no means to confine our attention to\r\nthe medical writers. This becomes still more necessary, if we are\r\nbound at the same time to try and discover the ætiological relations\r\nof such a disease, of which it can be stipulated at the outset that it\r\nis intimately connected with the whole life and activity of peoples.\r\nThe Historian accordingly is absolutely compelled to test and examine\r\nthoroughly everything that can possibly enlighten him as to these\r\nrelations,—to interrogate the Literature of whole Nations.\r\n\r\nBut here comes in the drawback that only comparatively speaking a very\r\nrestricted proportion of the Authors of Antiquity have come down to us,\r\neven after due account has been taken of the possibility that many an\r\nunknown author may lurk concealed in some corner or other of the globe.\r\nThen again the Authors that _have_ been preserved are almost without\r\nexception Greeks or Romans, so that for the major part of the nations\r\nof Antiquity the national authorities are all but entirely lacking,\r\nor else, where something of the sort does exist, it is written in\r\na language the correct interpretation of which is still partially\r\nto seek. From all this it clearly follows that a complete and final\r\nexplanation of any controverted matter of Ancient times can never\r\nstrictly speaking be expected, and in particular that it would be a\r\nvery rash conclusion to declare positively that a Disease did not exist\r\nin Antiquity, _because_ in the extant and known books no mention occurs\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nBut in as much as this general incompleteness of information exists\r\nwith regard to all relations of Antiquity, and yet for many of them\r\nsufficient explanations have already been obtained, it is obviously\r\nincumbent on us to undertake for our subject also the enquiry how far\r\nthe extant authorities are capable of throwing light on it,—a task that\r\nexceeds indeed the powers of any individual, even should he be able to\r\nbring to it all the qualifications indispensable for the understanding\r\nof the said authorities. Consequently there is no other course left\r\nopen for him but to institute at the outset a survey of what has so far\r\nbeen accomplished and ascertained, and then to bring into line with\r\nthis whatever he has gleaned from his own study of the authorities,\r\nin the hope that another enquirer, like-minded and better equipped,\r\nmay follow on in the track of his endeavours, and so by dint of united\r\nefforts the intended goal may one day be reached.\r\n\r\nIt would be unprofitable for us, having laid claim, as authorities for\r\nour special enquiry into the ætiological relations, to the remains\r\nof Antiquity in their entirety, to consider them in detail in this\r\nplace. At the same time it might well seem expedient to specify more\r\nexactly such of them as are in a position to afford us information as\r\nto the Disease itself. These fall into two classes, viz. physicians\r\nand laymen. The estimation of the first class as authorities for the\r\nVenereal disease demands a number of conditions which we shall only get\r\nto know in the course of our subsequent exposition of the ætiological\r\nrelations themselves, and will therefore more conveniently find its\r\nplace after this,—in that part of the work where the question is\r\ndiscussed of the influence of medical aid on the disease. Similarly\r\nonly a part of the lay authorities come in here,—authorities from\r\nwhom, as may be supposed, we have only to expect rather fragmentary\r\ninformation, but who are all the more important, when they do exist, as\r\nby their evidence is proved men’s wide, in fact universal, acquaintance\r\nwith the disease; and they cannot be charged with having made their\r\nobservations of it through such or such a pair of theoretical\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\nThe more copious the materials the Historian provides as to the\r\nætiological relations, the more scanty will be his contributions on the\r\nquestion of the existence of the disease, as historical characters of\r\nhighest importance, or conspicuous frequency of the disease, give him\r\noccasion to mention it.\r\n\r\nThe case is different, from the first with the _Poets_. The _Satirists_\r\nand _writers of Comedy_ it is true can only supply hints, and these\r\nare often quite unintelligible for later times, if Scholiasts and\r\nCommentators had not taken on them the task of explanation,—though\r\nagain their statements must often be used with caution, as they are\r\nso apt to impute to earlier times the opinions of their own. But here\r\nalso the field of these hints is very circumscribed, as they are only\r\nadmissible so far as it is possible to extract from the subject-matter\r\na ridiculous, satirical _motif_ (_versus iocosi_, _carmina plena\r\nioci_,—jesting verses, songs full of jest, are demanded by the very\r\npersonality of Priapus); and even then acquaintance with the fact\r\nalluded to in general terms is presupposed on the part of hearer and\r\nreader. We see from this how ill-considered is the contention of those\r\nwho say that poets like _Horace_, _Juvenal_ or _Martial_, if they had\r\nbeen acquainted with the injurious consequences of sexual intercourse\r\nwith Hetaerae, could hardly have failed to allude to them on occasion\r\nin _unequivocal_ terms. Hensler[4] excellently observed long ago:—“In\r\nour Century certainly no German poet says one word about it,—neither\r\nthe dallying light-o’-love versifiers nor the serious poets. But from\r\nthis to draw the conclusion,—_then_ Venereal disease did not exist\r\namong the people, _then_ it has never been seen in Germany this year,\r\nwould make physicians and barber-surgeons smile!”\r\n\r\nThen again consider the widely different character of the Peoples and\r\ntheir Languages. The flowery Asiatic and Hindoo was, to begin with,\r\nfar enough removed from the spirit of Satire, and on all occasions\r\npreferred to have recourse to images that to us may well seem more\r\nthan obscure. The Greek writers of Iambi (Satiric verses in the Iambic\r\nmetre) are all but completely lost to us, while of the Comedians\r\nwe possess only _Aristophanes_, in the interpretation of whom we\r\nare certainly not yet far enough advanced to make all his allusions\r\nplain to us. Above all, those who pronounce so dogmatically as to the\r\nexistence of the Disease on the evidence of hints, appear to have\r\nhardly a notion of the condition in which the Lexicography of both\r\nGreek and Latin is,—a condition still in many respects deplorable.\r\n\r\nBesides this the Greeks, and for a time to an almost greater degree the\r\nRomans,[5] were above all things reticent in speech. The Roman still\r\npreserved intact through all the frivolity of his later days certain\r\nshrines, that were never broken open until the period of the utter\r\ncorruption of morals; and then no doubt afforded all the richer booty.\r\nBut in Satire it was not the fact that became matter of derision, but\r\nthe habits of the voluptuary merely _as affecting morality_, as for\r\ninstance is clearly seen from a perusal of the passages of Juvenal[6]\r\nread in their mutual connection. Moreover the following account will\r\nsufficiently prove that even among the Romans affections of thee\r\ngenitals were never ascribed to _natural_, only to _unnatural_ coition,\r\nPaederastia and the like; and that it was the vice that was derided,\r\nand not properly speaking its consequences.\r\n\r\nAfter the Satirists come the _Epigrammatic poets_, near akin to them.\r\nWhether in this province the Greeks will afford much material, later\r\ninvestigations must decide; how abundantly the Roman _Martial_ has\r\nrewarded our repeated perusals, the reader will soon be enabled to\r\nconvince himself.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Erotic poets_ who composed their lays under the inspiration\r\nof Aphrodité surrounded by the Graces or of the roguish Eros, no one\r\nwill expect to gain anything towards our object. The fact that the\r\n_lascivious_ Erotic writers of Antiquity have for the most part been\r\nlost can only be deplored by the Historian of the Venereal disease; for\r\nundoubtedly such works were in existence in considerable profusion,\r\nonly as in our own day they were carefully kept concealed from the\r\neyes of the uninitiated. That the Greeks were not poor in such-like\r\nproductions Cynulcus teaches us, who says to a Sophist[7]: “Thou\r\nlyest in the tavern, not in company with friends, but with harlots,\r\nhast a throng of panders round thee, and carriest always with thee\r\nthe works of _Aristophanes_, _Apollodorus_, _Ammonius_, _Antiphanes_\r\nand the Athenian _Gorgias_, _who all of them have written of the\r\nAthenian Hetaerae_. One may fitly call thee a _Pornograph_, like the\r\npainters _Aristides_, _Pausanias_ and _Nicophanes_.” Writings of the\r\nsame character were still extant in _Martial’s_[8] time, for the\r\nlascivious epigrams on the walls of the grottos, temples and statues of\r\nPriapus[9], on garden-walls, and so forth, afforded an inexhaustible\r\nmine for collecting amateurs, to whom we owe the Priapeia that have\r\ncome down to the present day. Had they all been preserved to posterity,\r\nwe should doubtless have had no need to bewail the lack of clear\r\ninformation as to the Venereal disease among the Ancients.\r\n\r\nConnected with the poems are the myths and legends of Antiquity. These\r\nhowever being difficult to understand when studied for their own sake\r\nowing to the confusion that still reigns in all the interpretations and\r\ndiscussions of them, hardly admit of being used for our purpose with\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nFinally we have yet to mention the Fathers as authorities for the\r\nhistory of the Venereal disease, for their “Orationes contra Gentes”\r\n(Denunciations of the Gentiles) especially afford much valuable\r\nmaterial towards a knowledge of the moral condition of the nations\r\nof Antiquity. True it is very likely these only too willingly allow\r\nexaggerations at the cost of Paganism, and attribute to an earlier time\r\nas already existing then, what really belongs to their own day. Still\r\nthese drawbacks lose much of their importance in so far as the question\r\nfor the present is only,—whether previously to the end of the XVth.\r\nCentury the Venereal Disease existed or no.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties that arise in the systematic study and manipulation\r\nof all these authorities require no further discussion here, being\r\nsufficiently well known to every investigator of Antiquity—be he\r\nphysician or layman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FIRST SECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluences which promoted the generation of Disease consequent upon the\r\n                 Use or Misuse of the Genital Organs.\r\n\r\n                                 § 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirectly it becomes a question of studying the diseases of a particular\r\npart or organ, diseases occasioned by the nature of the use made\r\nof that particular part or organ, it is primarily requisite to\r\ninvestigate more precisely the different forms of this use. Then and\r\nthen only shall we be in a position to define the share which secondary\r\ninfluences are competent to have in producing the said diseases. The\r\n_natural_ use of the genital organs is simply the performance of the\r\nacts necessary to beget children. On this depends the preservation\r\nof the whole species. It is therefore improbable that Nature should\r\nhave made such use liable to produce disease. As a matter of fact the\r\nexperience of all ages shows that in a judicious marriage, the natural\r\naim and object of which is the procreation of children, diseases of the\r\ngenitals seldom, if ever, arise.\r\n\r\nThere must then be a secondary use of the genital organs, which is\r\ncarried out without any view of begetting offspring, or in which\r\nthis plays only a subordinate part, and consequently some other\r\nthan the _natural_ object is that pursued. This object is _Sensual\r\ngratification_, which is associated with the use of the genital organs,\r\nand the use of the genital organs for the attainment of this object is\r\n_Sensuality_. Every misuse of any given organ cannot but be associated\r\nwith detriment both to the organ itself and to the whole organism as\r\nwell. This must of course also be the case with the genitals,[10]\r\nand it is in the misuse of them, in Sensual practices, that the most\r\nprominent efficient cause of maladies of these organs must be sought.\r\nNow it is our business to give a history of the maladies of the genital\r\norgans; and this is only possible on the condition that we have first\r\nof all gained a clear insight into the history of Sensuality.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it is a melancholy task for the Historian to follow up and\r\nreveal the moral degradation of Peoples and Nations even to its most\r\nrevolting details, and the Ethical philosopher might find not a few\r\nobjections to raise against an undertaking of the kind. None the less\r\nis the Physician compelled to search out under all forms the traces\r\nof Vice in its most secret hiding-places, and so fathom the nature of\r\nthe Disease in each individual case; and still more with Nations as a\r\nwhole is he permitted,—nay! it is his bounden duty, to fix his eyes on\r\ntheir doings and those of each of their component parts. Thus only can\r\nhe detect the nature of a Disease, which destroys the marrow of Peoples\r\nmore surely and more terribly for this very reason that its genesis\r\nproceeds in secret.\r\n\r\nThe reproach that the Moral repute of Nations is hereby ruined, and\r\nthe general mass saddled with the guilt of vices which of course only\r\nindividuals ever committed, has no place here, for it is solely through\r\nthe precise knowledge of the doings of these individuals that a due\r\nappreciation is possible of the danger that threatens the whole body\r\npolitic from this source. Had not a false ideal of Morality hitherto\r\nrestrained the individual, as it did the mass, from speaking out the\r\ntruth, we should be much farther advanced than we are in the knowledge\r\nof a Disease, whose characteristic symptom it is that those who suffer\r\nfrom it endeavour, as far as they possibly can, to conceal its cause!\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Cult of Venus[11].\r\n\r\n                                 § 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe imaginative son of the South, already of his very nature prone to\r\nattribute all that his unpractised intellect failed to comprehend to\r\nthe influence of a special Deity, was bound to do this pre-eminently\r\nin the case of an act that is even yet to us moderns wrapped in\r\nimpenetrable obscurity,—the act of generation and conception. How\r\ncould he think of this Deity[12], that used his own body as its\r\ninstrument and in so doing bestowed on him the highest pleasure of the\r\nsenses, otherwise than under the shape of a Being equally alluring and\r\nloving, convinced that this Being must be infinitely more alluring[13]\r\nthan even the beloved form that he held in his arms? “The young man’s\r\nfancy” craves a lovely maiden; the maiden needed a loving sister, into\r\nwhose arms she could trustingly throw herself, who intuitively divined\r\nall her soft, sweet emotions, to express which she sought in vain for\r\nwords, which she scarce dared to own to herself that she was conscious\r\nof, and understood them!\r\n\r\nTo the Goddess’ Temple she wandered, before her poured out the longings\r\nthat filled her heart to overflowing[14], and at the last offered up\r\nherself a gift at the holy place, that so Aphrodité Ἀφροδίτη εὔκαρπος,\r\nκουροτρόφος, γενετύλλις,—Aphrodité rich in fruit, giving offspring, of\r\nthe birth-hour) might be glorified in her, and herself be a participant\r\nin the highest happiness of Woman,—the joys of Motherhood. First she\r\nprepared herself by bodily purification[15] before she trod the\r\nTemple threshold, then at the Temple altar she received spiritual\r\npurity; and thus thrilled through and through with the influence of the\r\nholiest, the Priest’s hand[16] led her to the arms of her Lover, who\r\nas unspoiled yet and unsophisticated as she, had not sought to unveil\r\nthe most august secrets of Nature with audacious hand. Intoxicated with\r\nrapture he drew his darling on to the Torus (sacred couch) bedecked\r\nwith fragrant blossoms, and almost unconsciously to himself, became the\r\ncreator of a being wherein both saw themselves made young again.\r\n\r\nIf Man is really the noblest of created Beings, made by the Creator\r\nin his own image, in very truth then the power that unconsciously\r\nraises Man to the level of his Maker must be a divine power too, and\r\nthat act in the exercise of which it comes itself into play an act of\r\nmost sublime worship. Are we to suppose there never was a time when\r\nMan, pure as he came from the hand of his Creator, followed in the\r\nsingleness of his heart no other law but that written in his heart?\r\nSurely not merely in the dreams of the Poet was found the legend of an\r\nEden, from which Man was driven out by his own guilt; more true to say\r\nthat to this day we are all of us born therein. But alas! others’ guilt\r\nor our own tears us away from out the garden of Paradise, ere we have\r\nyet been able often to raise our eyes to take delight in its glory.\r\nThus it is that many a man now and again has the memory of a Dream,\r\nthat accompanies him on his pilgrimage through life, and he hopes to\r\nfind in the future what long ago, before he grew conscious of its\r\nexistence, became a thing of the past. Perchance it may be the fatal\r\ntasting of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge was nothing else than the\r\nmisuse of the genital organs, to content bestial longings, to arouse\r\nthe titillation of an enervating pruriency[17]. “And the eyes of them\r\nboth were opened, and they knew that they were naked!” The bestial had\r\nwon the victory over the divine, which fled away from the desecrated\r\naltar; and the Genius of Mankind wept over their Fall!\r\n\r\nHere is the History at once of Man individually and of whole Peoples.\r\nOver the Temple-worship of Aphrodité also impended such a crisis;\r\nand sooner or later the holy courts of Venus Urania (Heavenly Venus)\r\nchanged into the Lupanar of Venus Vulgivaga (Brothel of Venus of the\r\nStreets).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 3.\r\n\r\nA precise knowledge of the extension of the Venus-cult in chronological\r\norder would readily supply us the means of following up historically\r\nthe moral deterioration of the Peoples of Antiquity; but so long as we\r\ndo not possess this, History cannot be expected to give us anything of\r\ngreat value. All that we are for the present in a position to give,\r\npertinent to the object we aim at, is as follows:\r\n\r\n“The worship of this Urania,” says Pausanias[18], “the Assyrians first\r\nintroduced amongst themselves, after the Assyrians the Paphians in\r\nCyprus[19], and among the Phoenicians[20] the inhabitants of Ascalon in\r\nPalestine. From the Phoenicians the inhabitants of Cythera[21] learned\r\nto know and worship her. At Athene Aegeus introduced her worship.” It\r\nwas at Babylon then that the cult of Venus originated as _Mylitta_\r\nworship, spread over the inland parts to Mesopotamia as the Sabaean[22]\r\nreligion, and was passed on by the Phoenicians to the seaboard peoples\r\nas Astarté-worship. For at the spot where this cult first arose, it\r\nlasted longest in its original purity, and _Herodotus_[23] could report\r\nhow at Babylon the daughters of the country were compelled _once_ in\r\ntheir life-time to give themselves for money to a strange man to win\r\nthe favour of the goddess, then to return to their dwelling all the\r\nmore virtuous for the sin, and neither promises nor gifts, however\r\ngreat these might be, availed ever again to draw them into the arms of\r\na stranger. Later indeed it was different even here, perhaps through\r\nthe influence of the Phoenicians, who had manifold dealings with them.\r\nFor _Herodotus_ himself relates elsewhere (Bk. I. 196), that after the\r\ncapture of Babylon by the Persians, the poorer classes, dreading the\r\nforcible abduction of their daughters, if means of subsistence failed\r\nthem, made them harbour-wenches[24]. And accordingly _Q. Curtius_[25]\r\nfelt bound to write of Babylon:\r\n\r\n“Nihil urbis eius corruptius moribus, nihil ad irritandas\r\nilliciendasque immodicas voluptates instructius. Liberos coniugesque\r\ncum hospitibus stupro coire, modo pretium flagitii detur, parentes\r\nmaritique patiuntur.... Feminarum convivia ineuntium in principio\r\nmodestus est habitus, dein summa quaeque amicula exuunt, paulatimque\r\npudorem profanant: ad ultimum ... ima corporum velamenta proiiciunt;\r\nnec meretricum hoc dedecus est sed matronarum virginumque apud quas\r\ncomitas habetur vulgati corporis vilitas.”\r\n\r\n(Nothing can well be more corrupt than the manners of this City,\r\nnothing more artfully adapted to excite the passions and allure to\r\nvoluptuous excesses. Strangers are permitted by parents and husbands,\r\nprovided the price of shame is forthcoming, to have lustful intercourse\r\nwith their children and their wives.... At their first entrance to the\r\nbanquet-room the women’s dress is modest, presently they remove their\r\nouter robes one by one, and little by little violate all modesty, ...\r\nat the last stripping off the innermost coverings of their persons. And\r\nthis is no mere abomination of harlots, but the habit of matrons and\r\nmaids, who consider that in thus making themselves cheap and exposing\r\ntheir bodies they are showing courtesy). This custom we find again\r\ncarried still further amongst the Armenians, who _Strabo_[26][27] says\r\nconsecrate their daughters for some considerable length of time to\r\nAnaitis, and only after this suffer them to marry. _Herodotus_[28]\r\nrelates the same custom of the Lydians, degenerated in the same\r\nway as had been the case in later times at Babylon, for here too\r\nthe lower classes used to abandon their daughters to prostitution\r\nfor a livelihood. Still in its original purity the usage reached\r\nthe Phoenicians[29], but with them also would seem to have early\r\ndegenerated, although in particular towns of Phoenicia the practice\r\nappears to have been followed only under certain circumstances.\r\n_Lucian_[30] relates that the women, of Byblus, where was a Temple of\r\nἈφροδίτη βυβλίη (Venus of Byblos), _if_ they would not allow their hair\r\nto be cut off at the Funeral-feast of Adonis, were bound in honour of\r\nVenus for one whole day to abandon their bodies to strangers. Among the\r\nCarthaginians[31] also, as in Cyprus[32], maidens had to earn their\r\ndowry, and the Tyrant Dionysius introduced the same custom, no doubt\r\nwith a secondary design of a profit for himself, amongst the people of\r\nLocri.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 4.\r\n\r\nAs to the _reason_ for this custom, one might be found in the opinion\r\nthat prevailed almost universally in Antiquity amongst the Asiatic\r\npeoples, that the first-fruits of everything were consecrate to the\r\nDeity, and accordingly the virgin’s hymen must be offered up to Venus.\r\nBut this will not in any way explain why the self-surrender must nearly\r\nalways take place with a _Stranger_ (ἀνδρὶ ξείνῳ) of all people in the\r\nworld. _Heyne_[34] and _Fr. Jacobs_[35], who paid special attention to\r\nthis custom, are it is true agreed in thinking that a religious motive\r\nlay at the bottom of it, though they differ in their conception of what\r\nit was; but neither of them hit on the right explanation. A careful\r\ndistinction must be made between the _Ceremony_ and the _Act_ of the\r\nself-surrender. The first was a matter of religion, the second not; for\r\nthe women were conveyed at Babylon outside the Temple-precincts, in\r\nCyprus to the sea-shore, for the purpose of yielding their bodies to\r\nstrangers[36]. Had the act been regarded at that period as a religious\r\none, it would of necessity have been practised, as was the case before\r\nand again later, in the Temple or at least within its precincts, and of\r\ncourse with fellow-countrymen, strangers not being allowed to take part\r\nin any native religious practice.\r\n\r\nThe discrepancies however soon disappear if it is remembered that in\r\nAntiquity, as to this day amongst many savage peoples, not only was the\r\nmenstrual blood (of which more fully later) held to be impure, but also\r\nthe blood that flowed, when a virgin was deflowered, from the rupture\r\nof the hymen, and consequently the act of defloration as well. The same\r\nheld good in the case of coition with widows, because it was believed\r\nthat with them the menstrual blood accumulated in greater quantity,\r\nthen was discharged on occasion of the first coition, and must\r\nnecessarily cause injury to the man. This also explains why _Herodotus_\r\n(loco citato) says γυναῖκες (women) and not simply κόραι or παρθένοι\r\n(girls, virgins); and removes at once _Heyne’s_ doubts (p. 32) and the\r\ndifficulties raised by _Heeren_[37].\r\n\r\nThe dwellers on the sea-coast, who enjoyed more active intercourse\r\nwith the rest of the world, left to strangers the polluting act of\r\ndefloration, whilst among inland peoples this office was undertaken\r\nfor those of the higher classes[38] by the priests, or else an idol,\r\nspecially appropriated for the purpose, a Priapus or Lingam (see\r\nlater) was employed. Subsequently several mistaken reasons may well\r\nhave been alleged for the custom; the only idea that continued to be\r\nconsistently held was that defloration was not a proper function of\r\nthe bridegroom. It was rather made a matter of honour, and accordingly\r\nbrides offered themselves first to the wedding-guests, as among the\r\nNasomonians in Africa[39] and in the Balearic Islands[40], where the\r\nright of preference went by age.\r\n\r\nWe must then take into consideration _several_ causal factors to help\r\nus to an explanation of the custom in question. The original motive\r\nmay very well have been in every case the consecration of the maiden’s\r\nvirginity to the goddess,[41]—Hieroduli (Temple hand-maids) in the\r\nearlier meaning. Further again the maiden was bound to pay her tribute\r\nto the goddess of sexual Pleasure[42], so as to co-operate with the\r\nhusband with a view to the procreation of children. Little by little\r\nthe custom lost its purer character. After a time it ceased to be any\r\nlonger one of universal obligation, and became binding only for the\r\npoorer classes, who found in it an opportunity of earning a dowry[43]\r\nfor their daughters. Meantime the rich adopted the habit of presenting\r\nfemale slaves to the temple of the goddess, thereby giving occasion\r\nfor the establishment of the regular Hieroduli,—who subsequently grew\r\ninto _filles de joie_ in the proper sense, and laying the foundation\r\nof the brothel system (see later). Out of the idea of consecration\r\nwas subsequently developed on the one hand that of initiation for the\r\nmarried state,—an idea found again in the “proof-nights” custom of the\r\nMiddle Ages, and on the other the idea of bondage that grew into the\r\n“Jus primae noctis” (Right of first night).\r\n\r\nAs second factor then must be reckoned the belief in the harmfulness\r\nof the blood resulting from rupture of the hymen at defloration; and\r\nconnected with this the actual injury that the man’s genital organs\r\nare occasionally exposed to in deflowering a maid with narrow vaginal\r\norifice, or at any rate the effort necessarily called for to perforate\r\nthe hymen, a motive not without actual weight amongst indolent\r\nAsiatics[44]. To this day the bridegroom at Goa gives thanks to the\r\n_Priapus_ (Lingam), that has loosed his bride’s virgin-zone, with\r\nmarks of the deepest adoration and gratitude for having performed this\r\nhonourable service and so relieved him of a heavy task[45].\r\n\r\nFor the maid defloration is yet more painful, and as she had to go\r\nthrough it once and once only with a stranger, she might readily get\r\nthe idea that it was the stranger alone that was to blame; consequently\r\nthat every surrender to a stranger must involve the same sufferings.\r\nThis would deter her from a second experience of the kind, and all the\r\nmore so because the subsequent embraces of the husband stirred in her\r\nonly pleasurable sensations. So the wife had no inducement to break the\r\nmarriage vow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 5.\r\n\r\nWhen and under what circumstances the cult of Venus first came into\r\n_Greece_ can hardly be discovered, though indeed _Pausanias_ states in\r\nthe passage quoted above that it was Aegeus (Erechtheus) who brought it\r\nto Athens. For a long period it played only a subordinate part, being\r\nkept under by the primeval god Eros (Love)[46]. No doubt the physical\r\nelement may have come in early times from abroad[47], but before long\r\nthe stamp of the spiritual was strongly impressed upon it (the Graces\r\nwere added as handmaidens to Aphrodité!),—so strongly that the idea\r\nof the procreating power fell henceforth into the background, to give\r\nplace to that of Love, an idea that was entirely foreign to Asia. The\r\namalgamation of Eros and Aphrodité, who was now first hallowed by him,\r\nor as the poet puts it, now first brought forward into the assemblage\r\n(Order) of the Gods, came about so gradually and imperceptibly that\r\nit would hardly be possible to obtain a clear conception of the views\r\nof the Greeks on the point. In consequence of the growing intercourse\r\nwith the peoples of Asia, and particularly the Phoenicians[48],\r\nforeign customs and usages came to be introduced and adopted with ever\r\nincreasing frequency; and during the flourishing period of Greece\r\nwe see the Asiatic character of the Venus ritual come into ever\r\ngreater prominence, and the goddess herself in a sense re-introduced.\r\nEspecially was this the case in the Islands and the seaport-towns,\r\nwhere as a rule the worship of Aphrodité first arose. Hence she was\r\nentitled the goddess “born of the (Sea) Foam”, and temples were built\r\nto her as “Protectress of Havens.”[49]\r\n\r\nBut the Greek genius found this physical Cult too strongly opposed\r\nto its own spirit. The Greek could not bring it into unison with his\r\nEros-worship; and accordingly distinguished his goddess, under the name\r\nof Aphrodité Urania (Heavenly Aphrodité)[50], from that worshipped by\r\nother Peoples as Aphrodité Pandemos[51] (Aphrodité Common to all Men).\r\nThe latter was relegated to the Islands[52], and particularly Cyprus;\r\nand never properly speaking became a national Deity.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting as a general fact that the Venus Urania always\r\nbelongs, so it appears, to the inland regions, the Venus Pandemos on\r\nthe contrary to the sea-ports and islands[53]; for it was as a rule\r\nfrom East to West along the coast-lines that the Asiatic form of the\r\nCult spread, a thing that could not have happened except through the\r\ninstrumentality of a people early practising navigation, such as the\r\nPhoenicians.\r\n\r\nIt cannot fail to have an important bearing on our subject to make\r\na more precise acquaintance with the geographical distribution of\r\nthe Venus-cult. We propose to give here a brief enumeration of the\r\nlocalities where she had her temples. The passages in evidence for this\r\nwill be found given with tolerable completeness in _Manso_,—p. 46, also\r\npp. 158 sqq.\r\n\r\nIn _Cyprus_: at Paphos, whither came yearly a great concourse of people\r\nat the festival time[54]; in _Pamphilia_; _in Asia Minor_; along the\r\n_Coast-line of the Aegean_; in Caria (Cnidos); Halicarnassus; Miletus;\r\nEphesus; Sardis; Pergamus; Pyrrha; Abydos (Aphrodité πόρνη—harlot); in\r\n_Thessaly_; at Tricca; in _Boeotia_, (Tanagra—on the Sea); in _Attica_,\r\n(Athens, Colias, Pera[55], on the Cephissus); in the Islands of the\r\n_Aegean Sea_, (Ceos, Cos, Samos, where the temple was built from the\r\nearnings of the Hetaerae); in the _Peloponnese_: at Argolis, Epidaurus,\r\nTroezen, Hermioné, (was visited by maids and widows before their\r\nmarriage); in _Laconia_, (Amyclae, Cythera); _Arcadia_, (Megalopolis,\r\nTegea, Orcomenus); _Elis_, (Olympia, Elis); _Achaia_, (Patrae,\r\nCorinth); on the _Coast of the Corinthian Gulf_. From Greece we come to\r\n_Sicily_, where the temple of Venus on Mount _Eryx_ was hardly inferior\r\nto that of Paphos, also at Syracuse[56].\r\n\r\nNot without importance for our purpose is the statement of\r\n_Strabo_[57], that in the island of Cos in the temple of Aesculapius\r\nwas an effigy of Venus Anadyomené (coming from the bath), while\r\naccording to _Pausanias_[58] in a wood near the temple of the same god\r\nat Epidaurus was built a chapel of Aphrodité, since very possibly this\r\nmay throw some light on the question of the knowledge of complaints of\r\nthe genital organs possessed by the physicians of Cos. _Böttiger_[59]\r\nis of opinion that it was from the infirmaries and lazarettos of\r\nthe Phoenicians that the earliest medical science of the Greeks was\r\nintroduced—to the island of Cos; to Aegina, on the Peloponnesian\r\ncoasts, especially at Epidaurus. Probably these establishments were\r\noriginally under the protection of the national deity, until the latter\r\nwas superseded by the god Aesculapius.\r\n\r\nAs regards the cult of Aphrodité itself and the manner in which it was\r\ncelebrated in Greece, there appears to be a great lack of particulars\r\ncapable of supplying a general knowledge of the subject, and especially\r\nso where the Pandemian Aphrodité is concerned. Accordingly we will\r\nlimit ourselves here to mentioning the female _Hieroduli_[60] who as\r\nbondswomen of Aphrodité dwelt within the precinct of her Temple, and\r\nperformed the necessary observances in her honour. These were, as\r\nalready pointed out, of Asiatic origin, and to be found in greater\r\nnumbers particularly at Ameria[61] and Comana[62] in Pontus, where\r\nthey united with the temple-service the traffic of their bodies, (τῶν\r\nἐργαζομένων ἀπὸ τοῦ σώματος—of women who traffic with their body), just\r\nas in later times male Hieroduli gave up their persons for Paederastia.\r\n\r\nWhen the cult of Venus came into Greece, the Hieroduli were introduced\r\nalong with it. But they stripped off in Greece their Asiatic character,\r\nwhich they assumed again only in particular sea-port towns at the\r\nperiod of the decline of the moral greatness of the Nation, in places\r\nwhere the temple of Aphrodité Πόρνη (Harlot) was found. Specially was\r\nthis so at Corinth[63], in which city were more than a thousand female\r\nHieroduli, who were presented as slaves to the Temple. These attracted\r\na great concourse of strangers to the place, and in particular used\r\nto prey upon sea-faring visitors. Possibly however in this case as in\r\nothers a confusion took place between the Hieroduli properly so-called\r\nand the Hetaerae (Lady-Companions), who were euphemistically entitled\r\nPriestesses, Handmaids of Aphrodité, because they were under the\r\npatronage of that goddess, just as in a general way sexual enjoyment\r\nwas called an offering to Venus.\r\n\r\nThis would offer the best solution of the question, early debated, of\r\nthe morality of the Hieroduli. It was quite opposed to Greek feeling to\r\nworship Aphrodité after the Asiatic manner in her temples; and so the\r\nGreek distinguished his Venus Urania from the Venus Pandemos, and on\r\nthe same principle separated her temples into two categories, and made\r\nthe temples of Aphrodité Pandemos, Porné and Praxis (Common to All,\r\nHarlot, Sexual Intercourse) into the οἰκήματα τῆς Ἀφροδίτης (houses of\r\nAphrodité) serving as ordinary brothels, the latter being only intended\r\nfor Foreigners originally.\r\n\r\nHow and under what form the cult of Venus came into Italy is uncertain,\r\nbut the legend represents Aeneas as having brought it from Troy to\r\nLavinium and Laurentum[64], and already in the time of Romulus a Venus\r\nMyrtea (Venus of the Myrtle) was venerated at Rome. In addition a\r\nVenus Cloacina, Erycina, Victrix, and Verticordia (Venus—the Purifier,\r\nof Mount Eryx, of Victory, the Turner of Hearts) are mentioned, as\r\nalso a Venus _Calva_ (bald), whose worship King Ancus is said to have\r\nintroduced, at a time when the Roman women had lost their hair through\r\na plague and it had grown again by the help of Venus[65]. Not only are\r\nthe notices as to Venus worship in Italy very scanty, but everything on\r\nthe subject points to the fact that what there was of it in later times\r\nshowed little of the Asiatic impress; and we can conveniently leave\r\nthe matter where it is. Some questions belonging to the subject will be\r\ndiscussed later under the heading _Brothels_. In Spain too the worship\r\nof Venus was so unimportant that there is no need to enter more closely\r\ninto the point.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    The Lingam and Phallic Worship.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 6.\r\n\r\nWhilst the cult of Venus sprang up in the interior of Asia and was\r\ndisseminated from thence over other parts of the world, it is in\r\nIndia that the Lingam ritual took its rise, a ritual more closely\r\ncorresponding with the egotism of man. The idea that was early\r\nformed as the result of observation, that the man’s genitals were\r\nthe determining element in the process of generation, was bound to\r\nconceive these organs themselves as being, in the prevailing system of\r\nPantheism, under the Government of a Deity, and therefore as specially\r\nholy[66]. Now how could this Deity be represented to the eyes of men\r\notherwise than by that organ whereby he pre-eminently showed himself\r\nefficacious? The later legend it is true put the matter into another\r\nshape; and we find in _Sonnerat_[67] the myth of the Lingam-ritual\r\namongst the worshippers of Vishnu related in the following form:\r\n\r\n“The Penitents had by means of their sacrifices and prayers attained\r\ngreat power; but their hearts and their wives’ hearts must ever\r\nremain pure, if they would continue in possession of it. Now Siva\r\nhad heard the beauty of these latter highly extolled, and formed the\r\ndetermination of seducing them. With this aim in view he took on him\r\nthe form of a young mendicant[68] of perfect beauty, bade Vishnu\r\ntransform himself into a fair maiden and resort to the spot where the\r\nPenitents dwelt, in order to make them fall in love with him. Vishnu\r\nbetook himself thither, and as he passed through their midst threw them\r\nsuch tender glances that they were all enamoured. They left all their\r\nsacrifices to follow after the youthful fair one.[69]\r\n\r\nTheir passions grew all the fiercer, till at last they seemed all\r\nlifeless and their languishing bodies resembled wax that melts near the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nSiva himself hied to the dwelling-place of the women. In mendicant\r\nguise he carried in one hand a water-bottle, and sang as he went, as\r\nbeggars do. Now his song was so entrancing, that all women gathered\r\nround him, and thereupon under the gaze of the fair singer fell into\r\ncomplete distraction. This was so great with some that they lost their\r\nornaments and clothing, and followed him in the garb of nature without\r\nnoticing the fact.\r\n\r\nWhen he had marched through the village, he left it, but not\r\nunaccompanied, for all followed him into a neighbouring thicket, where\r\nhe had his will of them. Soon afterwards the Penitents became aware\r\nthat their sacrifices no longer possessed their former efficacy, and\r\n_that their power was no more the same as before_. After a period of\r\npious contemplation they now learned that it had been Siva who in the\r\nform of a Youth had seduced their wives into profligacy, and that they\r\nthemselves had been _led astray_ by Vishnu in the likeness of a Maid.\r\n\r\nAccordingly they determined to slay Siva by means of a sacrifice.\r\n\r\n(After many vain attempts), ashamed to have lost their honour without\r\nbeing able to avenge themselves, they made a last desperate effort;\r\nthey united into one all their prayers and expiations, and directed\r\nthem against Siva. It was the most terrible of their sacrifices, and\r\nGod himself could not withstand the effects of its operation. They went\r\nforth like a flame of fire and fastened on Siva’s organs of generation\r\nand severed them from his body. Enraged with the Penitents, Siva now\r\nresolved to set the whole world in conflagration to punish them.\r\nThe fire was already beginning to seize all around, when Vishnu and\r\nBrahma, on whom it was incumbent to save the living creatures in the\r\nworld, thought of means to put a stop to it. Brahma took the form of a\r\npedestal (?) and Vishnu that of the female organs of generation, and in\r\nthis way copied Siva’s organs of generation, and thereby the universal\r\nconflagration was stayed. Siva suffered himself to be appeased by their\r\nprayers, and promised not to burn up the world, if men would pay divine\r\nhonours to the dissevered organs.”\r\n\r\nNow if we consider this myth, as related here, more closely, we can\r\nscarcely avoid the suspicion that it is one of those that in later\r\ntimes were fabricated in many forms and foisted in as genuine. For\r\nit is entirely adapted to explain the origin of the Venereal disease\r\nin a way that leaves little to be desired; for which reason it was\r\nused by _Schaufus_ as the basis of his argument that the Venereal\r\ndisease was introduced into Europe from India. But on the other hand\r\nthis particular story is so accordant with the ancient creed of the\r\nHindoos in general that, if it is of later origin, it must have been\r\nput together with the assistance of older legends. The continued union\r\nwith the god, the power which the Penitents owed to him, was connected\r\nwith purity of heart, with avoidance of sensuality[70]; directly they\r\nindulged in the latter, they were deprived of the divine influence,\r\njust as in the Mosaic legend resulted from the Fall of Man. This is\r\none part of the legend,—manifestly a double one, while the other\r\nincludes the punishment of the being who wrought this profanation. His\r\ngenitals were destroyed by burning, which was attacking the World (i.e.\r\nmen through the women seduced by Siva?), and ceased only through the\r\nprayers of the Penitents, which again became efficacious; thereupon the\r\norgans thus happily made sound again were suspended as thank-offerings\r\nin the temple of the god.\r\n\r\nIt would seem then that it was the sickness of the male genitals which\r\ngave occasion for their consecration and worship; and this is so far\r\nnot inconsistent with reason, as the external position of the sexual\r\nparts in the male make every affection and injury perceptible at\r\nonce with but little trouble, while the female organs lie in a more\r\nconcealed situation. So that to the present day diseases of the male\r\ngenitals are far more precisely known and appreciated than those of the\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\nShould the enquirer push his search for an explanation further still,\r\nhe might, arguing from what is said as to Vishnu’s having copied\r\nSiva’s sexual organs that had been blighted by the fire under the\r\nform of female genitals, allege a sort of natural cause for the\r\nconflagration, to wit the suggestion of a mode of cure which was\r\nfrequently recommended and practised in the Middle Ages, when persons\r\nthought to drive away the clap by coition with virgins. But this is\r\nsurely nothing else than an explanation of the Lingam[71] superimposed\r\non the symbol of the _Juni_, the feminine principle, in the form of the\r\ntriangle, which Böttiger holds to be identical with the navel-stone of\r\nthe Paphian goddess.\r\n\r\n_F. G. Klein_[72] professes to have proved from annals of Malabar that\r\nlong before the discovery of the West Indies Venereal disease was\r\nknown in the East Indies, for the Malabar physicians _Sangarasiar_\r\nand _Alessianambi_, who lived more than nine hundred years ago, and\r\nother physicians even before them, make mention he says of the Disease\r\nand its cure by means of Mercury. But in Antiquity affections of the\r\ngenitals must have certainly been rarities amongst the inhabitants of\r\nIndia, for the Greeks[73] count them amongst the longlived peoples,\r\nas owing to their moderation they were subject to few diseases. Again\r\nthe climate of India is by no means to be considered as a factor\r\nfavourable to the disease, _Munro_[74] assuring us that simple herbs\r\nand moderate mode of life make the Hindoo recover, when no European\r\ncould fail to succomb.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 7.\r\n\r\nWhether the Phallus ritual in Egypt, where it is supposed to have\r\narisen from the generative organs of Osiris cut off by Typho, have\r\nan Indian origin or no, it is impossible to decide[75]. But that it\r\nexisted is certain, for not only are miniature Phalli often found\r\nwith Mummies, but it was also portrayed in the Temple of Karnak[76];\r\nand Herodotus[77] mentions it, and adds at the same time that in the\r\nstatutes the Phalli were _movable_. Perhaps from it was developed in\r\npart the cult of _Mendes_, of which we shall speak later. Although\r\n_Herodotus_[78] declares that the Egyptians were the first people\r\nwho had forbidden the accomplishment of coition in the temples, yet\r\n_Strabo_[79] writes that they dedicated to Zeus the fairest and\r\nbest-born maidens, whom the Greeks called Pallades, and compelled them\r\nto give themselves to men until their menstruation began for the first\r\ntime, whereupon they were married.\r\n\r\nAs regards Greece on the contrary there is scarcely a doubt that\r\nthe worship of Bacchus, and with it the Phallic ritual[80], was\r\ntransplanted to that country from India. To explain the occasion of\r\nthis introduction there is a legend related in the highest degree\r\nworthy of attention in connection with the history of affections of the\r\ngenitals. It is told by _Natalis Comes_[81] in the following terms:\r\n\r\n“Fuerunt et Phallica in Dionysi honorum instituta, quae apud\r\nAthenienses agebantur, apud quos primus Pegasus ille Eleutheriensis\r\nBacchi cultum instituit, in quibus cantabant quem ad modum Deus hic\r\nmorbo Athenienses liberavit et quem ad modum multorum bonorum auctor\r\nmortalibus extitit. Fama est enim quod Pegaso imagines Dionysi ex\r\nEleutheris civitate Boeotiae in Atticam regionem portante Athenienses\r\nDeum neglexerunt neque, ut mos erat, cum pompa acceperunt: _quare\r\nDeus indignatus pudenda hominum morbo infestavit, qui erat illis\r\ngravissimus_: tunc eis ab oraculo, quo pacto liberari possent\r\npetentibus, responsum datum est: solum esse remedium malorum omnium,\r\nsi cum honore et pompa Deum recepissent; quod factum fuit. Ex ea re\r\ntum privatim tum publice lignea virilia thyrsis alligantes per eam\r\nsolennitatem gestabant. Fuit enim Phallus vocatum membrum virile. Alii\r\nPhallum ideo consecratum Dionyso putarunt, quia sit autor creditus\r\ngenerationis.”\r\n\r\n(There were Phallic rites too established in honour of Dionysus,\r\n(these were observed among the Athenians; for it was at Athens that\r\nthe far-famed Pegasus first established the worship of Eleutherian\r\nBacchus)[82], at which men chanted hymns telling how the god freed the\r\nAthenians from a plague, and how he was the giver of many good gifts\r\nto mortals. For the story relates that Pegasus brought the images of\r\nDionysus from Eleutherae, a city of Boeotia, to the land of Attica; but\r\nthe Athenians slighted the god, and did not, as was the wont, receive\r\nhim with a procession. _Wherefore the god was wroth, and afflicted the\r\nmen’s private parts with a disease that was most grievous to them._ So\r\nthey consulted the oracle, asking in what way they might be freed from\r\nthe plague, and received the answer: there was one only remedy for all\r\ntheir ills, viz. that they should welcome the god with due honour and\r\nfitting procession. And this they did accordingly. And in commemoration\r\nthereof they used to bind _virilia_ (male generative organs) of wood to\r\nthe thyrsi (Bacchic staves), and carry them thus at the solemnity in\r\nquestion; and this was done both privately and publicly. For _Phallus_\r\nis the name given to a man’s privy member. Others again considered that\r\nit was consecrate to Dionysus for this reason, because he was deemed\r\nthe author of procreation).\r\n\r\nStill more striking is the legend which the same author, _Natalis\r\nComes_[83], gives of the introduction of Priapus worship into\r\nLampsacus, though it bears so great a resemblance to the preceding that\r\nthe one might almost be thought to have been taken from the other.\r\nAphrodité, he says, on the occasion of Bacchus’[84] progress to India\r\nwas made pregnant by him, and on her return to Lampsacus was brought to\r\nbed of _Priapus_, whose deformity was caused by the goddess Juno[85],\r\nwho afforded succour to the mother at the time of his birth:\r\n\r\n“Deinde, cum adolevisset (Priapus) pergratusque foret Lampsacenis\r\nmulieribus, Lampsacenorum decreto ex agro Lampsaceno exulavit.—Fuerunt\r\nqui memoriae prodiderint Priapum fuisse virum Lampsacenum, qui cum\r\nhaberet ingens instrumentum et facile paratum plantandis civibus,\r\ngratissimus fuerit mulieribus Lampsacenis. Ea causa postmodo fuisse\r\ndicitur, ut Lampsacenorum omnium ceterorum invidiam in se converterit,\r\nac demum eiectus fuerit ex ipsa insula. At illud facinus aegerrime\r\nferentibus mulieribus et pro se deos precantibus, post cum nonnullis\r\ninteriectis temporibus _Lampsacenos gravissimus pudendorum membrorum\r\nmorbus_ invasisset, Dodonaeum oraculum adeuntes percunctati sunt an\r\nullum esset eius morbi remedium. His responsum est: morbum non prius\r\ncessaturum, quam Priapum in patriam revocassent. Quod cum fecissent,\r\ntempla et sacrificia illi statuerunt, Priapumque hortorum Deum esse\r\ndecreverunt.”\r\n\r\n(Subsequently when he—Priapus—had come to man’s estate, and was now\r\nexceedingly pleasing to the women of Lampsacus, by a decree of the\r\nLampsacenes he was exiled from the territory of Lampsacus.—Some there\r\nare to tell the tradition that Priapus was a man of Lampsacus who had\r\na huge “instrument” ready and willing for the making of new citizens,\r\nand who on that account was most pleasing to the Lampsacene women.\r\nWherefore it is said afterwards to have come about that he incurred the\r\nenvy and hatred of all the rest of the men of Lampsacus, and eventually\r\nwas expelled from the island altogether. But this was a disaster that\r\nthe women most bitterly regretted; so they prayed to the gods to help\r\nthem, and after some interval of time had elapsed _a most grievous\r\ndisease of the private parts attacked the men of Lampsacus_. Then they\r\nreported to the oracle of Dodona, and enquired of the god if there\r\nwere any remedy for this plague. The reply was to the effect that the\r\ndisease would not cease till they had recalled Priapus to his native\r\nland. This they did; and furthermore built temples and established\r\nsacrifices in his honour, and decreed that Priapus should be the god of\r\ngardens).[86]\r\n\r\nWhatever interpretation we may give to these legends of Bacchus and\r\nPriapus, this much at any rate may be gathered from them without fear\r\nof contradiction, that affections of the male genitals at the time when\r\nthey first became prevalent were taken to be the original cause of the\r\nintroduction of Phallic worship,—in connection with the defloration of\r\nvirgins mentioned in § 4. This is not without importance as bearing on\r\nthe antiquity of the well-known Indian legend of the Lingam-ritual; and\r\nat the same time shows clearly that those affections of the genital\r\norgans must have borne a malignant character that men could not explain\r\nto themselves otherwise than as proceeding from the wrath of a Deity, a\r\ndeity who on the other hand alone possessed the power to remove these\r\nills. Another factor of great importance in connection with affections\r\nof the genitals in Antiquity, and of all the greater importance in as\r\nmuch as it leads us to the conclusion that resort was had for their\r\ncure not to human but to divine assistance, partly indeed depends on\r\nreasons which we shall discuss more exactly later on. However these\r\nreasons may in part be gathered at once from the following _supremely\r\nimportant_ poem in the Priapeia[87], to which _de Jurgenew_ first\r\ncalled attention in his Dissertation, p. 11, but without communicating\r\nit in its entirety:\r\n\r\n\r\n                             VOTI SOLUTIO.\r\n\r\n  Cur pictum memori sit in tabella\r\n  Membrum quaeritis unde procreamur?\r\n  _Cum penis mihi forte laesus esset,\r\n  Chirurgique manum miser timerem,\r\n  Diis me legitimis, nimisque magnis_\r\n  Ut Phoebo puta, filioque Phoebi\r\n  _Curatum dare mentulam verebar_.\r\n  Huic dixi, fer opem, Priape, parti,\r\n  Cuius tu, pater, ipse par videris:[88]\r\n  Qua salva _sine sectione_ facta,\r\n  Ponetur tibi picta, quam levaris,\r\n  Parque consimilisque concolorque.\r\n  Promisit fore: mentulam movit\r\n  Pro nutu deus et rogata fecit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PAYING A VOW.\r\n\r\n(Why, you ask, is portrayed on the tablet the member whereby we are\r\nbegotten? _When, as it befell, my penis was damaged, and like a\r\nwretched coward I dreaded the Surgeon’s hand, I was afraid to entrust\r\nmyself and the cure of my organ to the great official gods, that\r\nwere too high for me_, such I mean as Phoebus and Phoebus’ son. “To\r\nthe member, I said, do thou, Priapus, give aid,—the member that thou\r\nart fashioned in the likeness of[88]. Then when it has been healed\r\n_without the knife_, a painted image of the part thou has relieved\r\nshall be dedicated to thee,—a match, a perfect match in form and in\r\nhue.” Thus he made his vow; the god nodded his penis in token of\r\nassent, and answered his prayers.)\r\n\r\nThis poem, whoever its author may have been[89], testifies most\r\nexplicitly that the Poet’s genital organs were seriously affected (by\r\nPhimosis and Ulcers?), that he from fear (_timerem_) of the Surgeon’s\r\nknife, from shame (_verebar_) before the regular physician in view of\r\nthe part affected and of the way in which he had got the disease, had\r\nrecourse to prayer and vow before the image of Priapus, and thereupon\r\nhappily recovered without medical assistance!\r\n\r\nThe veneration of Priapus was pretty well universal in Italy, as the\r\nRoman poets teach us, and equally so the Phallic worship, of which\r\nthe frequent representations of the Phallus that we find at Pompeii\r\nbear witness; in fact the latter, as _Knight_ shows, maintained itself\r\nin connection with the veneration of Saints _Cosmus_ and _Damian_\r\ndown to the last Century at Isernia. The just quoted Poem from the\r\nPriapeia might perhaps serve to afford us an indication as to how the\r\nPhallus ritual has come to be connected with these Christian Saints;\r\nfor probably patients attacked by the Venereal disease prayed to them,\r\njust as the Romans did to Priapus. Possibly examples of such cures by\r\nthe saints in question are found in the “Acta Sanctorum Bollandi”.\r\n(Bollandist Lives of the Saints),—under Sept. 27.; but we are not able\r\nto consult the book. These Saints however were not the only ones that\r\nwere venerated in the Middle Ages in the same way as the Priapus of the\r\nAncients. In France unfruitful wives used to pray to St. Guerlichon, in\r\nNormandy to St. Giles, in Anjou to St. René, in connection with whom\r\nthey practised rites which _Stephanus_ declares himself ashamed to\r\nspecify[90].\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Plague of Baal-Peor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 8.\r\n\r\nAlthough the period at which the worship of Priapus was introduced\r\namong the different Peoples cannot be always definitely fixed, and\r\nalthough Classical Mythology invariably counts him as belonging\r\nto the newer[91] gods, yet he appears in quite early times to have\r\nplayed a not unimportant part in Syria[92],—if that is to say the\r\nconclusion[93], pretty generally believed on other grounds, is well\r\nfounded, that the god Baal Peor was a sort of Priapus, in whose\r\ntemple, situated on Mount Peor[94], young Maidens were offered up.\r\nThe Rabbis[95] derive the name from פְּעוֹר _aperire_ sc. _hymenem\r\nvirgineum_, (to open _sc._ the hymen of a virgin), as if it had sprung\r\nfrom the Phallus ritual, as still found in Italy. At Goa indeed a man’s\r\nmember made of iron or ivory is fastened in the Pagoda, which in the\r\ncase of every bride is pushed by the parents and relations into her\r\nvagina, until it brings away with it visibly the bloody traces of the\r\nrupture of the hymen[96]; a proceeding that is connected, as shown in\r\n§ 4., with the belief in the malignity of the menstrual blood, and in\r\nthat of blood coming from the ruptured hymen. On the Coromandel Coast\r\nlikewise a wooden Priapus is to the present day most ardently venerated\r\nby the inhabitants[97].\r\n\r\nHere again we encounter a legend, which is not without importance\r\nfor the history of the affections consequent upon the misuse of the\r\ngenital organs, to wit the story of the _Plague_ that broke out amongst\r\nthe Jews at Shittim in consequence of their having taken part in the\r\nworship of Baal-Peor. _Sickler_[98] was the first who, as a champion of\r\nthe antiquity of the Venereal disease, made this the subject of a more\r\nprecise examination. However, in order to obtain as clear an insight\r\ninto the matter as possible, it will be needful to quote at length the\r\npassages of the Old Testament connected with the subject, according to\r\nthe English Revised Version[99]:\r\n\r\n        Numbers, Ch. 25. verses 1-18: “And Israel\r\n       “abode in Shittim, and the people began to\r\n       “commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab:\r\n    2) “for they called the people unto the sacrifices\r\n       “of their gods, and the people did eat, and\r\n    3) “bowed down to their gods. And Israel joined\r\n       “himself unto Baal-Peor: and the anger of the\r\n    4) “Lord was kindled against Israel. And the\r\n       “Lord said unto Moses, Take all the chiefs of\r\n       “the people, and hang them up unto the Lord\r\n       “before the sun, that the fierce anger of the\r\n    5) “Lord may turn away from Israel. And Moses\r\n       “said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every\r\n       “one his men that have jointed themselves unto\r\n    6) “Baal-Peor. And, behold one of the children\r\n       “of Israel came and brought unto his brethren\r\n       “a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses,\r\n       “and in the sight of all the congregation of\r\n       “the children of Israel, while they were weeping\r\n    7) “at the door of the tent of meeting. And\r\n       “when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son\r\n       “of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from\r\n       “the midst of the congregation, and took a\r\n    8) “spear in his hand; and he went after the man\r\n       “of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of\r\n       “them through, the man of Israel, and the\r\n       “woman through her belly. So the plague was\r\n    9) “stayed from the children of Israel. And those\r\n       “that died by the plague were twenty and four\r\n       “thousand[100].... Now the name of the\r\n  14)  “man of Israel that was slain, who was slain\r\n       “with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the\r\n       “son of Salu, a prince of a fathers’ house among\r\n  15)  “the Simeonites. And the name of the Midianitish\r\n       “woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter\r\n       “of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers’\r\n  16)  “house in Midian.—And the Lord spake unto\r\n  17)  “Moses, saying, Vex the Midianites, and smite\r\n  18)  “them: for they vex you with their wiles, wherewith\r\n       “they have beguiled you in the matter of\r\n       “Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter\r\n       “of the prince of Midian, their sister, which\r\n       “was slain on the day of the plague in the\r\n       “matter of Peor.”\r\n         Numbers, Ch. 31. verses 7-24: “And they\r\n       “warred against Midian, as the Lord commanded\r\n  9)   “Moses; and they slew every male.... And\r\n       “the children of Israel took captive the women\r\n       “of Midian and their little ones; and all their\r\n  14)  “cattle, etc.... And Moses was wroth with\r\n  15)  “the officers of the host, ... and Moses said\r\n       “unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?\r\n  16)  “_Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through\r\n       “the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against\r\n       “the Lord in the matter of Peor, and so the plague\r\n  17)  “was among the congregation of the Lord._ Now\r\n       “therefore kill every male among the little ones,\r\n       “and kill _every woman that hath known man by\r\n  18)  “lying with him_. But all the women children,\r\n       “that have _not_ known man by lying with him,\r\n  19)  “keep alive for yourselves. And encamp ye\r\n       “without the camp seven days: whosoever hath\r\n       “killed any person, and whosoever hath touched\r\n       “any slain, purify yourselves on the third day\r\n       “and on the seventh day, ye and your captives.\r\n  20)  “And as to every garment, and all that is made\r\n       “of skin, and all work of goats’ hair, and all\r\n       “things made of wood, ye shall purify yourselves.\r\n  21)  “And Eleazar the priest said unto the\r\n       “men of war which went to the battle, This is the\r\n       “statute of the law which the Lord hath commanded\r\n  22)  “Moses: howbeit the gold, and the\r\n  23)  “silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the\r\n       “lead, every thing that may abide the fire, ye\r\n       “shall make to go through the fire, and it shall\r\n       “be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with\r\n       “the water of separation (impurity): and all that\r\n       “abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through\r\n  24)  “the water. And ye shall wash your clothes\r\n       “on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean,\r\n       “and afterward ye shall come into the camp.”\r\n\r\nBesides these passages in the Books of Moses we find the plague\r\nof Baal-Peor further mentioned in the following places in the Old\r\nTestament:\r\n\r\n         _Joshua_, Ch. 22. v. 17: “Is the iniquity of\r\n       “Peor too little for us, _from which we have not\r\n       “cleansed ourselves unto this day_, although there\r\n       “came a plague upon the congregation of the\r\n       “Lord?”\r\n         _Psalm_ 106. verses 28-30.: “They joined\r\n       “themselves also unto Baal-Peor, and ate the\r\n  29)  “sacrifices of the dead (idols). Thus they\r\n       “provoked him to anger with their doings; and\r\n  30)  “the plague brake in upon them. Then stood\r\n       “up Phinehas, and executed judgement: and\r\n       “so the plague was stayed.”\r\n         _Hosea_, Ch. 9. v. 10.: “I found Israel like\r\n       “grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers\r\n       “as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first\r\n       “season; but they came to Baal peor, and\r\n       “consecrated themselves unto the shameful thing,\r\n       “and became abominable like that which they\r\n       “loved.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 9.\r\n\r\nWe find the Jews on their march towards Canaan already arrived at\r\nthe Jordan, from which river Shittim lay at a distance of 60 Stades\r\nor 2½ leagues according to _Josephus_[101], and the neighbouring\r\nPeoples in a state of terror at their near approach and at their\r\nvictories. The King of the Moabites, Balak, had sent to the soothsayer\r\nBalaam, that the latter by his arts (his curse) might annihilate the\r\nthreatening foe. Balaam however, inspired by the spirit of the Lord,\r\nblessed the sons of Israel instead of cursing them, but gave Balak\r\ncounsel how he could in another way bring about the ruin of the Jews.\r\nThis counsel is indicated in the passage quoted, Numbers Ch. 31, v.\r\n16, without being explicitly stated; but what it was can indeed be\r\npartially gathered from the context of the whole passage, and was\r\napparently so understood by the author of the Apocalypse, when he\r\nsays:[102] “But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast\r\nthere some that hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a\r\nstumblingblock before the children of Israel, _to eat things sacrificed\r\nto idols, and to commit fornication_.” Both _Philo_ and _Josephus_, who\r\nperhaps lived only a little later, picture the course of events in full\r\ndetail, though, it is true, from unknown authorities.\r\n\r\n_Philo_[103] writes as follows:\r\n\r\n“Quae prius, inquit (Bileam), dixi oracula sunt omnia et\r\nvaticinationes: de reliquo quae loquar, animi mei coniecturae\r\nerunt.—Age vero praeclara eius monita videamus, quibus artibus\r\ninstructa fuerint ad certissimam offensionem eorum, qui semper\r\nvincere poterant. Cum enim intelligeret Hebraeos una tantum ratione\r\ncapi posse, violata facinore aliquo lege, per stupri libidinem et\r\nintemperantiam, magna mala, ad maius impietatis scelus inducere\r\nstudebat voluptatis esca. Huius enim, aiebat, regionis, o rex, mulieres\r\nspecie reliquis longe praestant: viri autem nulla re facilius quam\r\nmulieris forma expugnari possunt. Proinde si formosissimas quaestum\r\nfacere prostareque permiseris, iuventutem adversariorum velut hamis\r\ncapient. Ita autem doceri eas oportet, ne statim floris sui volentibus\r\ncopiam faciant. Nam molestus ille aculeus simulatae recusationis\r\nlibidinem acrius excitabit, et amorem accendet, actique libidine\r\ntanquam obtorto collo trahuntur, quidvis et facere et pati in animum\r\ninducent. Amatorem igitur ut quaeque sic affectum nacta erit, quae\r\nad venationem illam subornantur, ferociter dicat: tibi consuetudine\r\nmea frui nefas est, nisi a patriis institutis desciveris, mutataque\r\nsententia eadem iuxta mecum colere coeperis. Huius defectionis fides\r\nea demum mihi perspecta fuerit, si libamentorum eorundem et sacrorum\r\nparticeps esse volueris, quae simulacris et statuis reliquisque signis\r\nex ritu facere solemus.—Sic igitur ille tum consulebat: rex ista non\r\nabs re dici ratus, sublata de adulteris lege et abrogatis omnibus\r\nde stupro corruptelaque sanctionibus, proinde quasi nunquam rogatae\r\nessent, liberam facit mulieribus quibuscum vellent consuescendi\r\npotestatem. Illae vero licentia et impunitate data adolescentulorum\r\nmultitudinem illiciebant, multo ante eorum animis circumventis et\r\nillecebrarum praestigiis ad impietatem impulsis: usque dum postremo\r\npontificis filius Phinees, facta ista supra modum indignatus\r\n(teterrimum enim ei videbatur eodem tempore corpora et animos pro\r\ndeditiis, illa voluptatibus, hos sceleri et impiae fraudi tradi\r\niuvenilis audaciae memorabile facinus viroque dignum forti edidit. Nam\r\nquendam sui generis sacris operatum ad scortum ingredi conspicatus,\r\nneque submittentem in terram vultum, neque latere cupientem, neque,\r\nut assolet, clanculum aditum suffurantem, sed inverecundam fiduciae\r\nintemperantiam prae se ferentem et in flagitio ridiculo velut in re\r\npraeclara magnifice se efferentem, exacerbatus indignitate rei et\r\niusta repletus ira, cursu irrumpens adhuc in lecto iacentes amatorem\r\net meretriculam confodit, genitaliaque eis praeterea desecat,\r\nquibus incestum satum patrarant. Istud exemplum aliqui continentiae\r\net religionis studiosi iussu Mosis imitati, omnibus qui initiati\r\nfuerant simulacris manu factis, propinquis iuxta necessariisque\r\noccidione occisis, scelus gentis expiarunt inexorabili sceleratorum\r\nsupplicio,—unoque die viginti quatuor millia hominum caesa sunt, et\r\nuna statim sublata est communis labes, qua totus exercitus maculosus\r\npolluebatur.”\r\n\r\n(All my words, said he (Balaam), thus far are dark sayings and\r\nprophecies; what I shall speak henceforth will be the counsels of my\r\nown mind.—But come let us look into his excellent advice, in what\r\nartful ways it has been framed for the sure and certain destruction\r\nof our ever-victorious foes. For perceiving that the Hebrews could be\r\novercome in one fashion only, viz. through their violating the law by\r\nsome terrible wrongdoing, he set himself, employing the bait of lust,\r\nto lead them on by way of fornication and incontinence, great offences\r\nin themselves, to the still greater crime of impiety. For this land,\r\nhe said, oh! King, far excels all others in the beauty of its women;\r\nand by no other thing may men’s minds be so readily mastered as by a\r\nwoman’s fairness. So if thou suffer the fairest amongst them to play\r\nthe harlot and offer their beauty for a price, they will catch the\r\nyoung men of our enemies, so to speak, on their hooks. But they must be\r\ninstructed not to surrender the enjoyment of their persons straightway\r\nat the first offer. For the sharp sting of a feigned refusal will, as\r\nthou knowest, excite their longing more keenly than ever, and inflame\r\ntheir passion, till driven on by lustfulness they are dragged along, as\r\nit were, by a halter round their necks, and there is nothing they will\r\nnot consent to do or suffer. Accordingly the lover that each of the\r\nfair women who are set on to this task has won for herself and brought\r\nto this condition, must be bluntly told: It is impossible for thee to\r\nenjoy my love unless thou break with the customs of thy fathers, and\r\nchange thy heart, and undertake the observance of the same rites as\r\nwe. And this desertion of thy people’s faith will I then only hold as\r\nmanifested, when I shall see thee willing to partake in those same\r\nlibations and sacrifices that we are wont duly to pay to our idols and\r\nstatues and other images.—Now such was the advice Balaam then offered;\r\nand the King deeming that he spake much to the purpose, repealed\r\nthe law as to unlawful intercourse, and removed all punishments for\r\nfornication and licentious conduct, and made them as though they had\r\nnever been, giving free licence to the women to lie with any man\r\nthey pleased. And the latter, permission being granted and impunity\r\nguaranteed, soon ensnared a great number of the young Jewish warriors,\r\nwhose minds indeed had long beforehand been entangled and by every\r\ntrick and allurement impelled towards impiety.\r\n\r\nAt the last the high-priest’s son, Phinehas, above measure indignant\r\nat such deeds of shame, and convinced that both souls and bodies were\r\nat one and the same time being enslaved, the one by sensual pleasures,\r\nthe other by wickedness and craft and impiety[104], did a deed at once\r\nmemorable for youthful daring, and worthy of a hero. For when he saw\r\na kinsman of his own and one of the priestly order go in to a harlot,\r\nand this without any look of shame fixed on the ground, without any\r\nattempt at concealment, without any stealing up privily and making,\r\nas men are wont in such a case, a surreptitious entrance, but instead\r\ncarrying it off with an air of shameless self-confidence and bearing\r\nhimself proudly as though his act were one to merit renown and not\r\nridicule, he was fired by the indignity, and filled with righteous\r\nanger rushes up and bursts in on the lover and his wanton actually\r\nlying on the bed. He pierces them through, and furthermore cuts away\r\nthose organs wherewith they were satisfying their unholy passion.\r\nThis example was followed, by command of Moses, by other zealous\r\npartisans of purity and religion; and those who had been initiated\r\ninto the service of idols died the death at the hands of their family\r\nand kinsfolk, and so the wickedness of the nation was expiated by a\r\nmerciless punishment of the wrongdoers;—and in one day four and twenty\r\nthousand men were slain, and thereby was straightway removed the common\r\nstain wherewith the whole host was spotted and polluted).\r\n\r\nIn much the same way, only still more fully, _Josephus_[105] relates\r\nthe circumstance. Licentiousness had laid hold of almost the entire\r\nhost, and ancestral institutions were in danger of being abandoned\r\naltogether. Consequently, Josephus says, Moses appointed an assemblage\r\nof the People and in a speech drew attention to the perils that\r\nthreatened. Sambrias (Simri) however made a defence, maintaining that\r\nthey had long enough obeyed tyrannous laws and would fain live free\r\nhenceforth. Hereupon he quitted the assembly, and was assassinated in\r\nhis tent by the enraged Phinehas. Josephus (§ 12.) proceeds:\r\n\r\n“Iuvenes autem omnes, qui virtutis aliquid sibi vindicarent et\r\nhonestatis studio tenerentur, Phineesis fortitudinis exemplo accensi,\r\neiusdem cum Zambria criminis reos interfecerunt. Multi itaque\r\nillorum, qui leges patrias violarant, horum egregia virtute perempti\r\nsunt. Peste autem reliqui omnes perierunt, deo hunc illis morbum\r\nimmittente. Et quotquot e cognatis, qui cum prohibere debuerint, eos\r\nad haec impulerant, a deo pro sceleris sociis habiti, pariter sublati\r\nerant.”[106]\r\n\r\n(But all the younger men who laid any claim to manly virtue and tried\r\nto live honorably, fired by the example of Phinehas’ bold deed, slew\r\nall that were guilty of the same crime as Sambrias. And so by their\r\nsingular courage and patriotism numbers of the men who had broken\r\ntheir ancestral laws were destroyed. But all that survived perished\r\nby a plague, that God sent upon them. Moreover such of their kinsfolk\r\nas ought to have hindered them, but instead had urged them to these\r\ncourses, these God deemed accomplices in the wickedness, and they also\r\nwere cut off.) Philo and Josephus are not indeed to be regarded as\r\nauthentic eye-witnesses of what they record; still the passages quoted\r\nfrom them prove this much, that in their time the opinions they express\r\nwere generally held.\r\n\r\nThe Jews were thus led astray by the daughters of the Moabites, and\r\nboth practised fornication with them and made sacrifice in their\r\ntemples to the god of the country, whose priestesses, as Balaam\r\ndeclared, were conspicuous above other women for their beauty. The\r\n_consequence_ of these excesses was an infectious disease, (according\r\nto _Josephus_ it communicated itself, but, he says, only to kinsmen!),\r\nwhich cost many[107] their lives. The number however fell far short\r\nof 24000, for these perished mainly by the sword of their brethren,\r\nas _Philo_ and _Josephus_ expressly remark, and the author of the\r\nPentateuch intimates, when he says (Numbers Ch. 26. v. 5.), “And\r\nMoses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that\r\nhave joined themselves unto Baal-Peor.” The narrator declares that\r\nby this slaughter the plague was stayed for the sons of Israel; but\r\nit certainly cannot have ceased altogether, as is manifest from the\r\npassages quoted from Joshua, where Phinehas asserts: that to that day\r\nthe people was not yet cleansed from the misdoing of Peor.\r\n\r\nThe disease therefore cannot have been merely some passing disorder. It\r\nmust evidently have been somewhat widely disseminated by the Moabitish\r\nwomen, and have been of very common occurrence among them; and that\r\nit was readily infectious follows from the whole course of Moses’\r\nproceedings. The latter was angry because the woman had been suffered\r\nto live, and commanded to put to death all of them that had known men\r\nin carnal intercourse, but to keep alive the young virgins,—and their\r\nnumber was, according to Ch. 31. v. 35., thirty-two thousand!—who\r\nwere brought into the camp as prisoners and there divided amongst\r\ntheir captors. So we see the executions took place not in order that\r\nopportunity for intercourse with the heathen women,—a thing which\r\nmight very well on its own account have been an abomination to the\r\nLord,—might be altogether removed, (for how in that case account\r\nfor the maidens being saved alive, brought into camp, and divided\r\nas booty?)[108] but that by this means the risk of the further\r\ndissemination of the disease might be for ever prevented.\r\n\r\nThe imminence of this risk in Moses’ opinion is shown finally by the\r\npurification of the host which he had despatched for the massacre\r\nof the Moabites and their women. He made it, prisoners and all the\r\nspoil included, halt for a period of seven days outside the camp, and\r\ntwice over submit to a thorough purification. The Jews had slain many\r\nthousands of men in their previous wars, nay! just before they marched\r\nagainst the Moabites, they had actually slaughtered 24000 of their own\r\nyouth; yet they had never been ordered to leave the camp for seven\r\ndays, and twice over during this time to purify themselves and all\r\ntheir possessions. Only after the annihilation of the Moabitish women\r\n(not of the Moabite men), from the accomplishment of which they had\r\njust returned, had this happened. All this points to some most cogent\r\nreason. Here comes into operation the same law which was enforced on\r\noccasion of purification after Leprosy and after foul discharge: and\r\nindeed also after contact with a dead person,—even where they had\r\nfirst caused the death of the said person! Thus no one can very well\r\ndispute the view taken by _Philo_,[109] when he says with regard to the\r\npurification after the annihilation of the Moabites:—\r\n\r\n“Nam ut legitima hostium caedes sit, attamen qui hominem interfecit\r\nquamquam iure, quamquam vim propulsans, quamquam coactus, non insons\r\nesse videtur nec extra noxiam, propter summam illam et communem hominum\r\ninter ipsos cognationem. Quo nomine piacula suscipienda fuerunt\r\ninterfectoribus ad luendum scelus, quod conceptum censebatur.”\r\n\r\n(For whereas the slaying of enemies is lawful, nevertheless whosoever\r\nhas killed a man, whether lawfully, or whether initiating the violent\r\nact, or whether on compulsion, seems not to be innocent or free\r\nfrom responsibility; and this is owing to that supreme and general\r\nrelationship of all mankind with one other. Wherefore certain\r\nexpiations had to be undertaken by any man who had killed another, to\r\nwipe out the guilt that was deemed to have been incurred).\r\n\r\nWhat was the precise nature of the disease that the Jews had brought\r\non themselves by their intercourse with the Moabitish women cannot\r\nindeed be determined; but that it affected the genital organs can\r\nhardly admit of a doubt. The fact, if it is a fact, that not a few lost\r\ntheir lives owing to it, need be no objection, since the ulceration\r\nof the genitals that prevailed at the end of the XVth. Century caused\r\nsimilar fatalities, and as we shall presently see, the uncircumcised\r\n_Apion_ met his death in some such way. Now the Jews were almost\r\nwithout exception still uncircumcised at that time, for it was\r\n_Joshua_[110] who first on his arrival in Canaan, at the bidding of\r\nJehovah, circumcised the children of Israel with stone knives on the\r\nhill Araloth. When the people adopted the worship of Baal Peor, we may\r\nbe sure they ceased at the same time to observe the ancestral laws of\r\npurification,—if indeed these latter even as regards foul discharge\r\nand leprosy as well as intercourse with women during menstruation were\r\nnot perhaps, as might almost be believed, _first_ enacted in all their\r\nseverity only in consequence of the plague of Baal Peor. Again it may\r\nwell have been this experience that first taught the inhabitants of\r\nPalestine the necessity of circumcision, which was then laid down as an\r\nordinance by command of Jehovah!\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Brothels and Courtesans[111].\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 10.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that it was in the Asiatic cult of Venus that the\r\nfirst elements were given for sexual excesses. It is hardly a matter\r\nof surprise therefore if these same elements came constantly, as has\r\nbeen shown above, into greater and greater prominence, and in this\r\nway pushed the original form of the Worship into the background. By\r\ndegrees as enlightenment increased and the respect felt towards the\r\ngods diminished, Venus also soon lost her old character as goddess of\r\nprocreation and sank into the patroness of sensual gratification. Her\r\ntemples as well as her holy groves lost their exclusive title to bestow\r\nthe blessing of fruitfulness on the embraces of the sexes, and came\r\nmerely to serve as appointed trysting-places of carnal pleasures. The\r\nofferings made at her shrines were no longer to win an assurance of\r\nposterity; they became bribes paid to buy a free opportunity for the\r\nindulgence of sensuality. They degenerated into fornication-fees, as\r\nher temples did into brothels. The priestesses of Astarté or Mylitta\r\nstood at the beck and call alike of strangers and natives, and the\r\nopportunity was ever open for sexual enjoyment. Hence too it is that a\r\nspecial designation for the brothel will be looked for in vain in Asia.\r\nThe thing existed there without the name being required; and the State\r\nfound no need to establish an institution, which had long ago, without\r\nany intervention on its part, taken form under the cloak of religion.\r\n\r\nEven amongst _the Jews_, who frequently enough, but always as a\r\ntemporary aberration merely, adhered to the foreign cult, brothels in\r\nthe strict sense seem never to have existed[112]. Although courtesans\r\nare frequently mentioned in the Old Testament, and even the dwelling\r\nof a Wanton as well as her behaviour pictured with considerable\r\nfullness of detail[113], yet all this would seem to have had more of a\r\nprivate than of a public character,—due heed being given to the fact\r\nthat not a few passages are to be taken only in a figurative sense.\r\nProstitution as a regular calling was strictly prohibited[114] to the\r\ndaughters of Israel; and such women as practised it openly seem to have\r\nbeen mainly foreigners, perhaps natives of Phoenicia and Syria, who\r\nat the same time entertained with dancing and the music of stringed\r\ninstruments[115]. But the attempt to draw a conclusion from this as to\r\nthe pre-eminent chastity of the Jewish women, as e.g. _Beer_ (on p. 25\r\nloco citato) wishes to do, would be justifiable neither for earlier nor\r\nyet for later times. The passages of the Old Testament dealing with\r\nSodom and with the dissoluteness under Mannasseh even in the very\r\nTemple at Jerusalem are sufficient by themselves to prove the contrary.\r\n\r\nAs to _Macedonia_ there is a passage in _Athenaeus_, quoted from\r\n_Hermesianax_ to this effect: ἀλλὰ Μακεδονίης πάσας κατενίσατο λαύρας\r\n(But he went through all the alleys of Macedonia), where _Dalechamp_\r\ntranslates the word λαύρα by brothel, but _Casaubon_ even in his time\r\nthrew doubt on this rendering.[116] Possibly however this judgement\r\nis connected with similar licentious practises among the Macedonians\r\nto what we find among the Persians[117], who indulged in sexual\r\nintercourse with their own mothers, daughters, etc., and begat children\r\nupon them,—a practice which _Euripides_[118] makes the Barbarians\r\ngenerally guilty of.\r\n\r\nBut if there _were_ actually brothels existing in Macedonia, this would\r\nbe the less surprising, as its inhabitants may well be reckoned amongst\r\nGreeks in many respects.\r\n\r\nThe Greek knew perfectly the boundary between the physical and the\r\nethical, and sought ever to subordinate the former to the latter. His\r\nwhole life belonged in the first instance to the State, of it he\r\nwas bound to be a citizen, and for it to endeavour to produce good\r\ncitizens. Consequently polygamy early disappeared in Greece, and so\r\ntoo community of wives, a custom which prevailed down to historical\r\ntimes at Sparta only. Monogamy was the first law of marriage, and\r\nmarriage was the bounden duty of every true citizen[119], to save his\r\nfamily from dying out. But while the Asiatic prided himself on the\r\nnumber of his children, the Greek’s boast was of their excellence.\r\nOnly with the object of procreating offspring was the Greek husband\r\nto rest in the arms of his spouse (ἐπ’ ἀρότῳ παίδων γνησίων—for the\r\nsowing, procreation of lawful children), and not to desecrate the holy\r\nTorus (marriage-couch) by mere lustfulness. Where this was stirred in\r\nhim, he ceased to be free; a slave of lust, he must consort only with\r\nslave-women, and not with free citizenesses[120]. Nay! even this was\r\npermitted solely to avoid greater evils; and illicit coition never\r\nceased to be held as something οὐ καλόν—unseemly[121], particularly\r\nwhen it was indulged in by married men.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown how under the clearer skies of Greece the Asiatic\r\nworship of Venus took on a form more worthy of mankind, how the Greek\r\ndistinguished his Venus Urania (Heavenly Venus) from the Venus of the\r\nrest of the world, the Pandemian (Venus common to all), and so set up\r\na barrier to the flood of dissoluteness,—a barrier however that was\r\nlittle by little broken down in later times. Foreigners, especially the\r\nvoluptuous inhabitants of Asia, when they saw that the Greek cult did\r\nnot like their native worship abet their carnal appetites, imported\r\nslave-women. These were purchased by the Greeks, and handed over as\r\nofferings to the temple of Aphrodité under the title of Temple-servants\r\nor “Hieroduli”[122]; and acquainted as they were with the needs of\r\ntheir fellow-countrymen, sought in every way to supply them,—as was in\r\nparticular the case at Corinth.\r\n\r\nThis example could not well remain without influence on private\r\nlife. The Greek indeed took no part in the Asiatic form of the\r\nVenus-worship; all the same illicit connection grew more and more\r\nuniversally prevalent, and as it could not be gratified in any other\r\nway, wives[123] and daughters of fellow-citizens were imperilled. To\r\navert this danger _Solon_ (B. C. 594) according to the statements of\r\n_Philemon_ and _Nicander_[124] introduced actual _brothels_, οἴκημα,\r\nπορνεῖον, (house, brothel) and public women, πόρναι (prostitutes),\r\nwho were accessible at a trifling charge. The houses of ill-fame were\r\nsituated, as _Pollux_ informs us, at Athens in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Harbour[125], and in the Ceramicus according to _Hesychius_[126],\r\nin later times also in the city itself[127]. They were presided\r\nover by a Whoremaster (πορνοβοσκός, πορνοτρόφος—harlot-maintainer,\r\nharlot-keeper). As to the internal arrangements of brothels among the\r\nGreeks we have been unable so far to discover anything more precise,\r\nbut in all probability the same conditions held good as among the\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\nBesides the regular brothels, women were also kept at the taverns[128]\r\n(καπηλεία, καπηλεῖον, καπήλιον, πανδοκεῖα,—tavern, inn), which likewise\r\nwere situated chiefly near the Port. The women were bought slaves, as\r\nthe passages quoted above (p. 70. note 2.) show; and even such free\r\nGreek women[129] as at a later period undertook the calling, were\r\nthen looked upon as slaves[130]. All women of this class, as well as\r\nthe whore-masters, were professionally under the supervision of the\r\nἈγορανόμοι (Market Commissioners[131], who fixed how much each was\r\nallowed to receive for her services. This fee was called μίσθωμα,\r\nδιάγραμμα or ἐμπολή,—fee, scale, purchase). It varied in amount;—8\r\nChalci— = 1 obol, a little less than twopence (τριαντοπόρνη,—an\r\nobol, two-penny, girl)[132], 2 obols— = about three-pence halfpenny\r\n(διωβολιμαῖα, χαλκιδῖτις,—a two obol, three-pence halfpenny,\r\ngirl)[133], a drachma—a franc, say ten-pence[134], a Stater—= 4\r\ndrachmae, say three and three-pence (στατηριαία,—a stater, three and\r\nthree-penny, girl)[135].\r\n\r\nThe Hetaera (Lady-Companion) seems in this respect to have enjoyed a\r\ngreater liberty of choice, and a knowledge of their prices to have\r\nbeen regarded as something out of the common[136]. The well-known\r\n_Gnathaena_ at Athens asked 1000 Drachmae for a night from a foreign\r\nSatrap[137]; _Phryné_ a mina (= 100 drachmae, something over four\r\npounds sterling). But the most notorious of all was _Lais_ at Corinth\r\nfor the high price at which she sold the marks of her favour, from\r\nwhich arose the proverb: Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum,\r\n(It is not every man that can go to Corinth)[138].\r\n\r\nLicences to follow the calling were granted to the whore-masters, and\r\nalso the women, on payment of a fixed duty, called “prostitute tax”\r\n(τέλος πορνικόν)[139], which was leased out yearly by the Magistracy,\r\nand collected by professional _farmers of the prostitution-tax_ or\r\nCollectors, known as πορνοτελώναι, who kept a complete list, in which\r\nwere included even the “Pathici” (pathic sodomites), of all liable to\r\nthe impost. From the proceeds of this prostitution-tax _Solon_ would\r\nseem to have built a temple at Athens to Aphrodité Pandemos[140].\r\nFrom this an idea may be formed, even if nothing more than a sort of\r\nbrothel is to be understood by the term, of the large number of women\r\nof this character and of the considerable revenue of the city.\r\n\r\nThe public women were either such as lived in the brothels (πόρναι,\r\nαἱ προστᾶσαι τῶν οἰκημάτων,—harlots, prostitutes of the “houses”),\r\nwhere they used to stand at the doors, and that in rows (ἐπὶ κέρως\r\nτεταγμένας,—drawn up in column) more or less stripped, in almost\r\ntransparent dresses (γυμναὶ, ἐν λεπτοπήνοις ὑμέσιν,—stripped, in\r\nfine-woven robes)[141], or else they were kept partly as ἑταῖραι\r\nμουσικαί—“musical” hetaerae, like the harp-girls in German beer-halls,\r\nor with procurers (μαστροπός, προαγωγός,—bawds, procurers) in their\r\ntaverns (προαγωγεῖα, μαστρόπιον, ματρύλλεια,—procurer’s house,\r\nbawdy-house, brothel). Or again they followed their trade in the\r\nPort-Market (the δεῖγμα) as δεικτηριάδες (Market-girls)[142], in\r\nthe στοὰ μακρὰ, (Long Portico), and generally in the Lanes of that\r\nneighbourhood (χαμαιτύπαι[143], χαμαιευνάδες, χαμαιεύνης, χαμαιτηρίς,\r\nχαμεύνης,—all nick-names for common strumpets, “ground-thumpers,”\r\n“sleepers on the ground”), where they either surrendered themselves on\r\nthe spot or hied to recognised harlots’ dens (χαμαιτυπεῖον) or houses\r\nof accommodation (τέγος)[144].\r\n\r\nThe place of their abode shows at once what class of men frequented\r\n“filles de joye” of the sort. It was foreign sailors[145] in particular\r\nwho here indemnified themselves for their compulsory continence at\r\nsea. Of Greeks only the dregs of the people and debauchees who had\r\nlost all self-respect came here; and even these used by preference\r\nthe taverns[146], where procuration was carried on as well[147],—for\r\nwhich reason they had fallen into general disrepute. For as late as\r\nAristophanes’[148] time the lower class of citizens felt no hesitation\r\nabout taking their pleasure along with their wives in inns. On the\r\nother hand persons of repute, prominent by office and dignities, were\r\nactually forbidden by law to visit such places. “Were an Areopagite\r\nto have been seen but once in an Inn,” says _Hyperides_[149], “his\r\ncolleagues would no longer have tolerated him as a member of the\r\nAreopagus.” Later, matters changed, for the moralizing _Isocrates_[150]\r\nsays, “Nay! no well-conducted slave dares even eat or drink anything in\r\nan Inn”; and _Theophrastus_, portraying the character of a madman quite\r\ndevoid of shame gives this as a trait,—he would be quite capable of\r\nkeeping an Inn!\r\n\r\nThe hetaera (female-companion) must be distinguished from the πόρνη\r\n(harlot), though both were under similar conditions as to police\r\nsurveillance. The hetaera was also strictly speaking a slave-woman,\r\nusually stolen as a child or otherwise obtained by procuresses, or\r\nbought by older hetaerae. They were educated[151] in all that was\r\nunderstood by the Ancients under the name “Music”, that over and above\r\ntheir charms of person, they might especially captivate their lovers\r\nby their intellectual cultivation, who bought them to give them their\r\nfreedom,—and then more often than not were presently abandoned by them.\r\nThe great nursery of hetaerae was above all places Corinth, from which\r\ncentre they travelled through all parts of Greece, as e.g. did Neaera,\r\nand frequently acquired enormous riches. The better class of them were\r\neverywhere held in high esteem; and many a hetaera, grown weary of\r\nher condition, gave her hand to a husband, in order to close her life\r\nas an honest wife[152], or else retired so as at any rate to lead a\r\nblameless existence[153]. Frequently indeed they were also “Dames de\r\nMaison”, and often kept a considerable number of girls under the title\r\nof hand-maids. This was the case with Nicareta, just mentioned, at\r\nCorinth, as well as with the famous Aspasia at Athens, the latter of\r\nwhom flooded all Hellas with her protegées[154]. Such as were held in\r\nless respect often put themselves under the protection of their more\r\nrenowned sisters, or else carried on the calling on their own account,\r\nand this especially when they were not so well educated, not “musical”\r\n(πέζαι ἑταίραι—_prose lady-companions_)[155], at Athens going to\r\nsettle at the Peiraeus to entice the merchants who arrived in the port,\r\nwhilst the more choice merely showed themselves there[156]. They often\r\nfollowed the troops on service in crowds, accompanying for instance\r\nthe general _Chares_[157] and _Pericles_ to Samos, where they made so\r\nlarge an income that they even built a temple of Ἀφροδίτη ἐν Καλάμοις\r\n(Aphrodité at Calami,—the Reeds)[158]. For the remaining details as\r\nto the life of the hetaerae the classical Treatise of _Friedrich\r\nJacobs_[159] should be consulted.\r\n\r\nEven these regular “filles de joie” at first existed almost exclusively\r\nfor foreigners, who often squandered prodigious sums in their arms;\r\nthe Athenians at any rate up to the time of Themistocles did not go\r\nwith them[160]. But the example proved too strong to resist. Little by\r\nlittle the younger men acquired a taste for the freer society of the\r\nhighly educated and luxuriously bedecked[161] courtesans, who on their\r\nside were possessed of tact enough to subordinate the purely sensual\r\nto the intellectual, in order to captivate the Greek sense of beauty.\r\nEven older men might easily be seen at their feet, for the Greek\r\nladies had but too little aptitude for stepping beyond the household\r\nsphere[162]. And so it was no longer matter for surprise when _Chares_\r\ntook with him on his expedition, as stated above, a large number of\r\nhetaerae. The Athenian youth was already in the habit of killing time\r\nin their society[163]; and the important rôle they played in the time\r\nof _Pericles_ needs to be no further insisted on. The Greek however\r\nnever descended to the lowest level of shameless, brutal, coarseness.\r\nBefore he threw himself into the arms of the foreign Wanton, he first\r\nraised her to some equality with himself; and of the handmaid and slave\r\nmade a friendly companion or hetaera!\r\n\r\nThe account here given applies particularly only to Athens, for our\r\nefforts to discover anything more precise as to brothels and courtesans\r\nin the remaining States and Cities of Greece have not so far been\r\ncrowned with success.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 11.\r\n\r\nWith the Roman, who could spare hardly a thought to any other feeling\r\nthan his pride, love played but an insignificant rôle in his existence.\r\nEven the deference he showed towards marriage and the married woman was\r\nnot really so much the outcome of a pure morality as of the interest\r\nthat the State must of necessity feel in the nursing-mothers of each\r\nsucceeding generation; in fact it can scarcely be regarded as much\r\nmore than a mere measure of policy. When a Censor like _Metellus_ in\r\na public Speech intended to encourage matrimony could say[164]: Si\r\nsine uxore possemus, Quirites, esse, omnes ea molestia careremus:\r\nsed quoniam ita natura tradidit, ut nec cum illis satis commode, nec\r\nsine illis ullo modo vivi possit, saluti perpetuae potius quam brevi\r\nvoluptati consulendum. (If we could live without a wife, Quirites,\r\nwe should all be free from such inconvenience; but since nature\r\nhas arranged it in this wise that neither with women in any real\r\ncomfort, nor without them at all, can existence be carried on, we\r\nought to think of our life-long well-being rather than of a momentary\r\ngratification),—and when even the strict _Cato_ declared[165]: In\r\nadulterio uxorem tuam si deprehendisses, sine iudicio impune necares:\r\nilla te, si adulterares, digito non auderet contingere, _neque ius\r\nest_. (If you should have detected your wife in adultery, you might\r\nkill her without trial and be scatheless; but she, if _you_ were the\r\nadulterer, would not dare to lay a finger upon you, _nor is it lawful_\r\nshe should),—it can hardly surprise us to find a complete lack of the\r\nideal or intellectual element in the relations of the sexes. These\r\nnever really rose among the Romans much above the level of the bestial;\r\nand harlots are found already in evidence at the very threshold of\r\nRoman history[166], whilst association with them far from ever being a\r\nsubject of blame, is rather represented as being a custom sanctified by\r\nimmemorial usage that had never been forbidden[167].\r\n\r\nIn spite of this however, and of the fact that the _Etruscans_[168],\r\nat a time when Rome was hardly more than _coming_ into existence,\r\nalready led a life that was worse than licentious, while _Messapians_,\r\n_Samnites_ and _Locrians_, as has been shown, habitually gave up their\r\ndaughters to prostitution,—in spite of all this I say, the sexual\r\nexcesses of the Romans were for the first 500 years on the whole\r\ninsignificant. Their way of life as warriors and husbandmen hardly\r\nsuffered them to sink into indolent sloth, the beginning of all vicious\r\nliving, whilst the law of the XII Tables, “_coelibes prohibeto_” (be it\r\nforbidden to remain bachelors)[169] forced men in the vigour of their\r\npowers to satisfy the impulse of nature in the arms of the lawful\r\nwife. But more and more did the Romans come into contact with foreign\r\nPeoples, and began to adopt more and more their customs and vices. In\r\nthe year 513 A.U.C. (B.C. 240) the Floralia were introduced, which\r\neven granting they cannot have had the origin that _Lactantius_[170]\r\nassigns them, yet by the very nature of the celebrations were an\r\noutrage on all good morals. Yet so universally popular were they that\r\n_Cato_ could win no greater concession to his indignant zeal against\r\nthem than that their closing scenes should be delayed until he had\r\nretired[171].\r\n\r\nThe enormous wealth the Romans had won as booty in their continual\r\nWars of spoliation, could not be hoarded unused, it must be enjoyed;\r\nand how enjoyed, the warriors knew already. The younger members of the\r\nEquestrian and Patrician orders went on travels, and learned in the\r\narms of Greek and Asiatic wantons how to lavish their money _secundum\r\nartem_. Then on their return to Rome finding the native Scorta (common\r\nharlots) no longer to their taste, they brought home with them their\r\nfreed-woman “Amica” (Mistress), who was a fair match for the Greek\r\nhetaera in greed, if not in refinement. It was not long before the\r\nold-fashioned Roman matron succumbed in the struggle with her for\r\nsupremacy, and by dint of her only too successful endeavours to outdo\r\nthe foreign courtesan in _recherché_ vice and effrontery, became but\r\nthe more despicable in the eyes of the proud Roman. She had indeed\r\nlearned to be a mother, but not to love. At the same time the Roman\r\nhimself, surrounded as he thus was by no softening influences, ceased\r\nnot only to be a citizen of the state, but even to be a man at all;\r\nand the Ruler of the World sank at last to such a depth of exaggerated\r\nviciousness that it became his glory and boast to be without a rival in\r\nits enormity.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion then is indisputable that only subsequently to the\r\nWars in Asia was Roman morality undermined[172]. At the same time it\r\nis impossible from the information given above to assign any definite\r\npoint of time at which brothels and public women came into vogue at\r\nRome, or at any rate when their existence as such was officially\r\nrecognized by those in charge of the police supervision of the city.\r\nWith the regulations and arrangements however we are more precisely\r\nacquainted. The brothels, _lupanaria_[173], _fornicas_[174], were\r\nsituated chiefly in the Second District (Secunda Regio) of the\r\ncity[175], the _Coelimontana_, particularly in the Subura (Suburbana)\r\nthat bordered the town-walls, lying in the Carinae,—the valley between\r\nthe Coelian and Esquiline Hills. In the same district was the _Macellum\r\nmagnum_, or Great Market, for all sorts of provisions[176] along\r\nthe banks of the Tiber, as well as the Cookshops, Stalls or Shops\r\n(Tabernae)—of the Barbers, even of the Public Executioner[177], and\r\nthe Castra peregrina, (Foreign Camp), barracks for foreign troops\r\nquartered in Rome under the Emperors as a garrison,—all circumstances\r\nthat occasioned a great concourse of men[178]. To the North the Subura\r\nmarched with the “Isis and Serapis”,—the Third District (Tertia\r\nRegio), where was situated the temple of Isis with its gardens and\r\ngroves. The regular brothels are pictured to us as being in the\r\nhighest degree uncleanly and dirty[179], so that their frequenters\r\ncarried away the smell with them. They possessed a definite number of\r\n“chambers”, _Cellae_[180], and above the door of each of these was\r\ninscribed the name of the girl, that which she had adopted on her first\r\nadmission[181], and the price of her embraces[182]. In each “chamber”\r\nwas to be found a bed (_pavimentum_, cubiculum, pulvinar,—pavement,\r\nsleeping-place, couch), which was spread with a particular kind of\r\ncoverlet, _lodix_, _lodicula_, (blanket, little blanket)[183], and a\r\nlamp, _lucerna_[184].\r\n\r\nAs for the brothel-keeper, the Romans seem to have had no special word\r\nto express this; they use in fact _leno_ in this signification, though\r\nthe word properly means the Procurer who merely offers his house for\r\nthe purpose, but does not keep women, giving them board and wage.\r\nPerhaps this arose from the fact that in earlier times no regular\r\nbrothels existed in Rome; the women merely hired a lodging, and the\r\nowner of the house had nothing at all to do with their business, whilst\r\nthe match-maker or pandar confined _his_ efforts to procuring girls for\r\nhis patrons and letting out his “chambers” for a fixed charge _merces\r\ncellae_ (hire of the chamber)[185], paid by each visitor. Only when\r\nthe business became more profitable, did Lenones or Lenae (Procurers,\r\nProcuresses), for women also carried on Lenocinium (procuration),\r\nactually keep girls, whom they bought, as slaves[186]. The Leno had\r\nhis _Villicus puellarum_ (Superintendent of the Maids), who assigned\r\nname and price, provided the girls with clothes[187], and kept a\r\nlist of them and what they earned[188]. In fact such of the women as\r\nwere bond-servants were obliged,—and this applied equally to those\r\nthat were not slaves,—to deliver up not merely the As for the hire of\r\nthe chamber, but the whole fee as well, according to the amount fixed\r\nby the brothel-keeper (Leno)[189], though much underhand trickery of\r\nvarious sorts occurred in connection with this regulation[190].\r\n\r\nThe brothels were not allowed to be opened before the ninth hour (four\r\no’clock in the afternoon), so as not to draw young men away from\r\ntheir duties[191]. The girls either stood (Prostibula—women who stand\r\nin front)[192] or sat (Proseda—women who sit in front)[193] before\r\nthe “chambers” or Lupanaria (brothels), to call the passers-by to\r\nthem. Did a lover make his appearance, then the door of the “chamber”\r\nwas carefully fastened[194], and “_occupata_” (engaged) written\r\nover the door[195], an unoccupied “chamber” being called _nuda_\r\n(naked)[196]. Towards morning the “chambers” were opened, and the\r\nLeno (brothel-keeper) let the girls go[197]. It would seem to follow\r\nfrom this that these either did not live in the brothel-keeper’s\r\nhouse at all, or that the “chambers” were situated somewhere else,\r\naway from head-quarters. From a passage in _Juvenal_[198] it has,\r\nperhaps wrongly, been concluded that these “chambers” were at the\r\nCircus Maximus. Such places are at any rate mentioned by _Dionysius\r\nof Halicarnassus_ as existing at the Portico above the shops[199];\r\nand without doubt several passages are to be found in Latin authors\r\nto prove that the women plied their trade even after the close of\r\nthe Representations[200], and we know that besides the regular Ludi\r\nCircenses (Games of the Circus) other performances of a similar kind\r\nwere held in the Circus.\r\n\r\nBesides the brothels, we find, particularly in the Taverns (cauponae,\r\ntabernae—inns, taverns) and Cookshops (popinae, ganea—cookshops,\r\neating-houses)[201], women kept by the hosts for the gratification of\r\ntheir patrons. As a rule these also were bought slave-women, who served\r\nthe guests, entertained them with dance and music, and surrendered\r\ntheir persons on desire. The hostesses themselves devoted their\r\nattention to both trades, as e.g. is shown by the “Copa” (Mine Hostess)\r\nascribed to _Virgil_; and hence they, and their husbands with them,\r\nstood in the eye of the Magistrate on the same footing with Lenones\r\nand Meretrices (Brothel-keepers and Prostitutes)[202].\r\n\r\nNow who frequented these places? Down to the time of the Empire only\r\nthe lowest class of the people, particularly Sailors[203], Freedmen\r\nand Slaves[204], though indeed later, when _Claudius_ and _Nero_[205]\r\nset so eminent an example, high and low equally might be found both\r\nin brothels and in Taverns and Cookshops. The bakers, envious of the\r\nprofits made by the inn-keepers, organized their tabernae (bread-stalls\r\nor shops) in the mills in such a way that they too could provide\r\ntheir customers with what they wanted[206]. This appears to have been\r\ndone first in Campania[207]. But not solely in regular Houses and\r\n“Chambers” were “filles de joie” to be met with. They carried on their\r\ntrade also as _Scorta erratica_ (wandering whores, street-walkers) the\r\ncommonest sort, in all public places, at the corners of streets[208],\r\nround the tombs and monuments[209], in out-of-the-way nooks of the\r\ntown and the surrounding plantations in its neighbourhood[210]. In\r\nthese places they carried on their trade, some no doubt on their\r\nown account, other perhaps as slaves working for their masters and\r\nmistresses and bound to deliver in a fixed sum daily.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of “filles de joye” so far particularized were\r\nall of them slave-women, but over and above these there were in Rome\r\na large number of Gay Women who carried on their profession entirely\r\non their own account, either merely as a second string to their\r\nbow, like the Mimes, Dancers, Harp-girls, Ambubaiae[211], or else\r\nas sole aim and object of their lives, in the character of _Scorta\r\nnobilia_ (noble whores) or _bonae meretrices_ (good harlots) to\r\nuse _Plautus’_ expressions. They were all of them foreigners, and\r\ngenerally freed-women[212], and were distinguished not only for their\r\nmore elaborate dress[213], but also on account of their education,\r\nwhich far and away surpassed that of the Roman ladies. In this respect\r\nhowever they fell short of the level reached by the Greek hetaerae\r\nin the best times of Greece, and for this reason never obtained the\r\ninfluence at Rome on the life of the city and of the State which the\r\nformer possessed at Athens. They were not so much friends (Amicae) as\r\nmistresses (Dominae) of their Roman lover, and their relations with him\r\nbodily only and not intellectual. For the rest this class yet awaits\r\na _Friedrich Jacobs_ to be its historian. They were either kept by an\r\nindividual lover, or else gave themselves only to rich admirers at\r\ntheir own private lodgings,[214] that lay _perdu_ far from the bustle\r\nof street and market; but no doubt descended, when the time of youth\r\nand beauty was over, to the condition of common courtesans or even of\r\nmere street-walkers.\r\n\r\nJust as happened in Greece, immodesty spread not a little among the\r\ndaughters and wives of the Roman citizens also, and already in the\r\nreign of _Germanicus_, _Tacitus_ could report[215]: “Eodem anno\r\ngravibus senatus decretis libido feminarum coercita, cautumque ne\r\nquaestum corpore faceret, cui avus aut pater aut maritus Eques Romanus\r\nfuisset.” (This same year severe decrees of the Senate were passed to\r\nrestrain unchastity on the part of women, and it was forbidden for any\r\nto give her person for hire, whose grandfather, father, or husband had\r\nbeen a Roman knight). So it cannot cause any great surprise to find\r\n_Martial_[216] declaring:\r\n\r\n  “Quaero diu totam, Sophroni Rufe, per urbem:\r\n    Si qua puella neget; nulla puella negat.”\r\n\r\n(I have long been searching the city through, Sophronius Rufus, if\r\nthere is e’er a maid to say no; there is not one!) To this result\r\nthe introduction at Rome of the worship of Isis had contributed not\r\na little[217]. Under pretence of serving Isis, the matrons found an\r\nopportunity of wantoning unhindered in the arms of paramours[218], for\r\nthe husbands dared not ent10217\r\ner the temple precincts while their wives\r\noffered were performing their ten days’ devotion there. Probably in\r\ncases of disease of the genitals Roman women offered their prayers to\r\nIsis, as the men did to Priapus, for the temples of the goddess were\r\nfull of images of parts of the body that had been healed and of maimed\r\norgans[219], and contained numerous establishments for the care of\r\nsick persons of this particular character.\r\n\r\nBut of more influence than all the rest was the example which\r\nthe Emperors _Tiberius_, _Nero_, _Caligula_ and the infamous\r\n_Messalina_[220] gave. Not contented with the possession of a\r\n_Harem_, they set up actual brothels in their palaces,—a practice the\r\naristocracy soon copied, organizing similar establishments on their\r\nestates, to be able to wallow indisturbed in the mire of bestial\r\nlusts[221].\r\n\r\nOf vice as practised in the Baths and of male whores in the brothels we\r\nshall speak later.\r\n\r\nNow how were Brothels and Courtesans affected in connection with the\r\npolice of the State in Rome? It has been shown already that no penalty\r\nwhatever attached either to illicit intercourse or to prostitution in\r\ngeneral, because the disgrace to individuals involved in the commission\r\nof such offences in the eyes of their fellows was thought sufficient to\r\nensure at any rate the daughters of citizens against unchastity. But\r\nthe case was different with married women who were guilty of a breach\r\nof marriage honour. Of the manifold punishments we will mention only\r\none here: the offender was imprisoned and obliged to surrender her\r\nperson to all comers, whilst each time this took place a notification\r\nwas given by the ringing of a bell;—a procedure that continued till\r\nfinally abolished by the Emperor Theodosius[222].\r\n\r\nThey sought indeed to avoid the punishment by declaring themselves\r\nengaged in Lenocinium (Procuration) as a calling, or by joining the\r\nranks of the the actresses; but the Lex Papia included provisions to\r\nput a stop to this irregularity[223].\r\n\r\n_Lenocinium_ (Procuration) in fact as well as the _licentia stupri_\r\n(fornication permit) had to be notified before the Aediles[224], whose\r\nespecial duty it was to see that no Matron became a prostitute[225].\r\nWith this object they were bound to frequently search all such\r\nplaces as have been specified above (_loca aedilem metuentia_—places\r\nthat fear the aedile)[226]; but dared not themselves indulge in any\r\nimmorality there[227]. When that pure-minded prince _Caligula_ became\r\nEmperor, he introduced the Whore-duty (_vectigal ex capturis_—tax on\r\nprostitution-fees) as a State impost[228]. This, _Alexander Severus_\r\nretained, it is true, but assigned the revenue from it to the\r\nmaintenance of the public buildings, that it might not contaminate the\r\nState Treasure.[229]\r\n\r\nThe information here collected, imperfect as it may be in many\r\nrespects, is yet sufficient to throw some light on the external\r\nrelations of brothels and courtesans. It shows convincingly that in\r\nthe entire absence of police supervision on the sanitary side, such\r\ndiseases as arose generally in Antiquity consequent upon coition must\r\nhave had their especial home and chief focus in the brothels and their\r\ndenizens. But of what nature these diseases were, and what parts of the\r\nbody they attacked, we shall only then be able to determine, when we\r\ncome to consider more precisely the actual excesses that led to them,\r\nwhether within or without the walls of the brothels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Paederastia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 12.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding investigations we have shown how the natural aim and\r\nobject of coition, viz. procreation of children, fell more and more\r\ninto the background, in order to make way for sensual gratification;\r\nand we have made acquaintance with the establishments that grew up in\r\ncourse of time for its indulgence. The facility with which the bestial\r\ninstinct could be satisfied and the titillation of carnal pleasure\r\nprocured, was bound to rob the customary manner of sexual indulgence\r\nof the charm of novelty, and to set the depraved imagination of the\r\nvoluptuary at work to solve the problem of how to import manifold\r\nvariations into the simple act of copulation. This stage reached, it\r\ninevitably followed that the natural ways of union of the sexes began\r\nto appear insufficient, and the methods of so-called _unnatural_ Love\r\n(Venus illegitima) grew up, wherein at last almost every trace of the\r\nspecific purpose of the genital organs was lost sight of.\r\n\r\nThe “figurae Veneris legitimae” (modes of natural Love) are not\r\naltogether without interest for the physician[230], but their study\r\nis less necessary for our particular purpose. The modes of “Venus\r\nillegitima” (unnatural Love) are what concern us here. The major part\r\nof these have unfortunately never been included by writers on the\r\nhistory of Venereal disease within the range of their enquiries. Hence\r\nit has come about that while on the one hand they have given quite\r\nfalse interpretations of various morbid affections, they have on the\r\nother mistaken for the names of diseases expressions signifying nothing\r\nmore than forms of the unnatural sensual indulgence alluded to. The\r\nhistorical enquirer into these subjects must indeed tread very slippery\r\nground. Supposing him to rise superior to the possible reproaches of\r\nmorality, fortified by the words of St. Paul[231], still he can find\r\nabsolutely nowhere in his investigations any secure stopping-place,\r\nhe must make up his mind to dispense with all external help and to\r\nbe thrown utterly on his own resources. Not only do the best and\r\nfullest Dictionaries of the Greek and Latin languages leave him almost\r\ncompletely in the lurch, but above and beyond this he has very often to\r\nstruggle with positive errors both in the Dictionaries and on the part\r\nof the professional Philologists in their annotations to the writings\r\nof the Ancients. These mistakes he must first of all discover, and\r\nafterwards correct. What such an undertaking involves, what powers it\r\ndemands, will be obvious to anyone who is in any degree conversant\r\nwith the systematic study of Antiquity. Nevertheless the task should\r\nnot remain unattempted, if that is, we wish ever to come to a clear\r\nunderstanding of the relations of words and things in this connection;\r\nand on this ground the following researches no less than others find a\r\nlegitimate place here. These we offer as the best that the limitation\r\nof our powers allowed,—at the same time gladly acknowledging the no\r\nsmall assistance we have received from the Treatises of Forberg[232]\r\nand Meier[232].\r\n\r\nPaederastia appears, as is the case with all sexual perversions, to\r\nowe its origin to the stimulation of the Asiatic climate, the mother\r\nof exuberance and voluptuousness. The primary condition of its genesis\r\nmay be easily traced, if side by side with the dictum of Forberg (loco\r\ncitato, p. 235): “Et voluptas quidem paediconis facile intelligitur,\r\ncum omnis voluptas mentulae pendeat ex frictione” (And the pleasure\r\nindeed of the sodomite is readily intelligible, since all voluptuous\r\npleasure depends on friction of the penis), we take into consideration\r\nthe fact that the genital organs of Asiatic women,—a fact true also of\r\nItalian and Spanish women[233]—like their whole bodies, exhibit great\r\nlooseness, and further note that the “Sphincter ani”[234] muscle far\r\nand away surpasses the “Constrictor cunni” in strength. So it is by no\r\nmeans improbable that the Apostle Paul is accurate when he says[235]:\r\n“Wherefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto\r\nuncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonoured among themselves;\r\n_for their women changed the natural use into that which is against\r\nnature_: and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the\r\nwoman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working\r\nunseemliness.”\r\n\r\nIn Asia _natural_ copulation formed a part of the Temple service of\r\nVenus, and in course of time Paederastia as well was joined with it,\r\nas is seen from the following passage of St. Athanasius[236]: “Sane\r\nolim Phoeniciae mulieres in idolorum templis prius prostabant, suique\r\nmeretricii quaestus primordia diis, qui illic colebantur, consecrabant,\r\nsuam deam stupris propitiam reddi, benevolamque hoc pacto effici ratae.\r\n_Viri quoque propriam ementiti naturam, nec amplius mares se esse\r\npatientes, in feminas se converterunt, pergratum et honorificum matri\r\ndeorum se ita facturas arbitrati._ Omnes denique una cum perditissimis\r\nvivunt, et secum ipsi pugnant ut peiores quotidie evadant, atque ut\r\ndixit sanctus Christi minister Paulus:—(Here follows the passage just\r\nquoted from the Epistle to the Romans.)—Haec autem et similia agendo,\r\nfatentur certe et arguunt deos, quos ipsi colunt, huiusmodi vitam\r\nduxisse, scilicet ex Jove puerorum corruptiones atque adulteria, ex\r\nVenere meretriciam vitam ... ex aliis alia didicere, quae quidem cum\r\nleges puniunt, tum probi homines abhorrent.”\r\n\r\n(Indeed the Phoenician women used in former times to prostitute\r\nthemselves for hire in the temples of their idols and to offer up the\r\ngains of their fornication as first-fruits to the deities that were\r\nworshipped therein, deeming that in this way they won the favour and\r\ngoodwill of their goddess. Moreover men, perverting their own proper\r\nnature, and no more enduring to be males, turned themselves into the\r\nlikeness of women, supposing that by so doing they rendered a service\r\nmost grateful and honourable to the Mother of the Gods. In one word\r\nthey all consort with the most abandoned of mankind, and strive one\r\nwith the other how they may grow worse and worse day by day; and as St.\r\nPaul the Apostle of Christ says:—(Here follows the passage just quoted\r\nfrom the Epistle to the Romans.)—By such and such-like acts they verily\r\nconfess and show forth that those gods that themselves worship led\r\nlives of a like kind. Thus from Jupiter they learned to seduce boys and\r\nto commit adultery, from Venus harlotry, and so on from the other gods\r\nother vile practices,—practices which are at once punished by the laws\r\nand abominated by every honourable man). The same passage explains also\r\nhow the Old Testament comes to designate Cinaedi (on pathic Sodomites)\r\nby the expression קָדֵשׁ (kadêsh, sanctus,—holy, consecrated). This\r\noriginally implied nothing more than a person who devoted himself for\r\nthe glory of a God as a servant in his Temple; and we have good reason\r\nfor believing we can establish the conjecture that the whole cult of\r\nthe Priests of Cybelé, etc., who had to practice emasculation and\r\nwho were known by the name of _Galli_, rests originally on a simple\r\nmisunderstanding of the expressions εὐνοῦχοι and ἀνδρόγυνοι (eunuchs,\r\nmen-women),—expressions which will be discussed later on,—these words\r\nhaving meant at first nothing more than _Cinaedi_ (sodomites). It was\r\nonly in later times that Paederastia became a motive for Castration,\r\nas by this means the body of the male could be made to preserve for\r\na longer period the youthful boyishness that approximated it to the\r\nfemale form. This is shown in the following passage of Lucian[237], a\r\npassage of special interest for the history of Paederastia:\r\n\r\n“So at first when men still lived the old heroic life and reverenced\r\nvirtue that brought them nearer the gods, they obeyed the laws that\r\nnature had laid down and marrying in due proportion of age became the\r\nfathers of noble children. But little by little the age degenerated\r\nfrom that high level to the pit of sensual indulgence, and struck out\r\nnew and abnormal modes of gratification. Soon a reckless licentiousness\r\nbroke the very laws of nature; and for the first time a lover looked\r\non a _man_ as on a woman to lust after him, and worked his wicked\r\nwill either by superior force or by dint of artful persuasions. So in\r\none bed came together one and the same sex. And each seeing himself\r\nin the other, took no shame in anything they did or in anything they\r\nsuffered to be done. Wasting their seed on barren[238] rocks, as the\r\nsaying goes, they bought a brief pleasure at the cost of deepest\r\ninfamy. Indeed with some to such a height of overmastering force did\r\ntheir reckless passion rise that they actually violated nature with the\r\nknife; and only when they had emptied men of their manliness did they\r\nattain the summit and acmé of their gratification.\r\n\r\n“But the wretched and unhappy creatures, that they may remain longer\r\nboys, suffer themselves to be no more men,—an ambiguous riddle midway\r\nbetween the sexes, neither preserving the sex they were born to, nor\r\nyet having any other to belong to. The bloom that was kept a while in\r\nyouth withers in old age and makes them wither with it in premature\r\ndecay. At one moment they are counted as boys, then lo! they are old\r\nmen; there is no middle time of manhood between the two. Thus wanton\r\nluxury, the foul mother of every evil thing, contriving shameful\r\npleasures one to cap the other, fell into the slough of that _disease_\r\nthat cannot even be named with decency, (μέχρι τῆς οὐ ῥηθῆναι δυναμένης\r\nεὐπρεπῶς νόσου) that no province of impurity might remain unexplored.”\r\n\r\nIn later times indeed castration was resorted to after the attainment\r\nof man’s estate, in order that the Eunuchs might be able to appease the\r\ntitillation of sensual desire in the women without fear of impregnating\r\nthem[239].\r\n\r\nIn Syria, where this vicious practice of paederastia was especially in\r\nvogue, the Jews also appear to have been acquainted with it[240]. From\r\nAsia, whether through the instrumentality of the Phoenicians, or as\r\n_Welcker_[241] maintains, through that of the Lydians, Paederastia came\r\nin the first instance to Crete, and spread from thence over the whole\r\nof Greece[242].\r\n\r\nJust as was the case with the cult of Venus in that country, so\r\nthe “love of boys” assumed quite a different form in Greece. As\r\n_Paedophilia_ (Affection for boys) it took rank as one of the means of\r\neducation, being consecrate to the heavenly Eros, while Paederastia\r\n(Carnal love of boys) fell to the province of the common Eros. Down to\r\nquite modern times Paedophilia has been confounded with Paederastia,\r\nand in this way a shameful stigma attached to the Greek _nation_,—a\r\nstigma that _Meier_, following the initiative of _Jacobs_ and _K. O.\r\nMüller_ (loco citato), was the first to free the Greeks from. Granted,\r\nthe two things approached very near each other; still _Paederastia\r\nwas never approved by the Greeks_[243]. At Sparta the violation of\r\nboys was punished by loss of civil rights, exile or death[244], and\r\nit was the same at Athens, as _Meier_ (loco citato) pp. 167 sqq. has\r\nsufficiently proved. The fact that the laws relating to this offence\r\nwere promulgated at Athens only after the time of _Solon_ shows that\r\npaederastia, as well as brothels, did not come into use there till\r\nabout that time. True Athens in later times was quite as notorious\r\nfor the prevalence there of paederastia as Corinth was for its Gay\r\nWomen[245]; and Aristophanes’ Comedies show only too abundantly how\r\nmuch occasion he could find for scourging the “Pathics”, and how the\r\nGymnasia and Palaestrae (Wrestling-grounds) also were responsible for a\r\ngreat deal of the harm done.\r\n\r\nFor, as Aristophanes[246] says:\r\n\r\n  ἐν παιδοτρίβου δὲ καθίζοντας, τὸν μηρὸν ἔδει προβαλέσθαι\r\n  τοὺς παῖδας, ὅπως τοῖς ἔξωθεν μηδὲν δείξειαν  ἀπηνές.\r\n  εἶτ’ αὖ πάλιν αὖθις ἀνισταμένους ξυμψῆσαι, καὶ προνοῆσαι\r\n  εἴδωλον τοῖσιν ἐρασταῖσιν τῆς ἥβης μὴ καταλείπειν.\r\n\r\n(Of old when boys sat at the trainer’s, they were bound to throw\r\nout the thigh, so as not to expose to the spectators’ gaze anything\r\nunbecoming; then again when they got up again, they had to scrape out\r\nthe mark in the sand, and take care not to leave behind a model of\r\ntheir youthful shape,—an incitement to lovers).\r\n\r\nBesides the Gymnasia and Palaestrae, the barber’s shops\r\n(κουρεῖα)[247], perfumers’ shops (μυροπωλεῖα)[248], Surgeries\r\n(ἰατρεῖα)[249], Money-changers’ counters (τράπεζαι)[250],\r\nbath-houses[251], and to a greater or less extent all kinds of\r\nworkshops (ἐργαστήρια)[252], particularly when in situations handy\r\nto the Market, served as trysting-places of the paederasts and\r\npathics. Here the former sought victims for their vicious desires,\r\nand the latter opportunities to sell their persons; while many of\r\nthe proprietors of such places may well have acted as Procurers\r\n(προαγωγοί, μαστροποί,—Procurers, Pandars) for this purpose. The vice\r\nitself was chiefly practised in lonely, obscure parts of the town, and\r\nparticularly on the Pnyx hill[253].\r\n\r\nThe Eleans and Bœotians are not only reproached with paederastia, but\r\nthe violation of boys is alleged to have been _allowed_ among these\r\npeoples[254]. Megara it is true is charged with ὕβρις (shameful\r\nviolence), a common designation for paederastia[255], but we may\r\ncertainly doubt whether the temple of Ἀφροδίτη πρᾶξις there, which\r\n_Pausanias_[256], mentions, had anything to do with this vice. The\r\nauthor in question says: “After the sanctuary of Dionysus is shown\r\na temple of Venus. The image of Venus is of ivory, and is called\r\nAphrodité _Praxis_. It is the most ancient image in the temple.” No\r\nother author however mentions any such cult as existing in Megara, and\r\neven though the word πρᾶξις (intercourse), as _Meier_ (loco citato p.\r\n153, note 49) has shown by examples, is used specially of paederastia,\r\nyet at the same time the passage of _Euripides_, Ion 894.\r\n\r\n    θεὸς ὀμευνέτας ἆγες ἀναιδείᾳ\r\n    Κύπριδι χάριν πράσσων.\r\n\r\n(Thou, god, partner of my bed, didst lead me, in shamelessness _doing\r\nfavour to Cypris—Love_), clearly proves that πράσσειν (to do, to have\r\nintercourse) was used of coition generally[257].\r\n\r\nMoreover in the passage of _Plutarch_ quoted a little above\r\npaederastia is called χάρις ἄχαρις (a grace that is without grace)\r\nand further down Ἔρως, Ἀφροδίτης μὴ παρούσης,—Ἔρως χωρὶς Ἀφροδίτης,\r\n(Love—Eros—where Aphrodité is not, Love without Aphrodité); so how can\r\nit have been regarded by the Greeks as under the _patronage_ of Venus?\r\nUndoubtedly πρᾶξις is here synonymous with πόρνη (harlot), and the\r\nἈφροδίτη πρᾶξις at Megara is nothing else than the Ἀφροδίτη πόρνη of\r\nother cities.\r\n\r\n_Chalcis_ had gained such notoriety for paederastia[258], that\r\nχαλκιδίζειν (to act the Chalcidian) was said proverbially for\r\nπαιδεραστεῖν (to practise paederastia). It was the same with _Chios_\r\nand _Siphnos_, as the expressions χιάζειν and σιφνιάζειν (to play\r\nthe Chian, the Siphnian) in _Hesychius_ prove. Hesychius says indeed\r\n_σιφνιάζειν_: i.e. to finger behind; for the Siphnians are ill-spoken\r\nof as enjoying boy-lovers. To act the Siphnian then means, to poke with\r\nthe finger. But the first explanation by καταδακτυλίζειν (to finger\r\nbehind), as well as the gloss of _Suidas_[259], show clearly that the\r\ninhabitants of the island of Siphnos,—one of the Cyclades, practised a\r\nspecies, if we may use the expression, of _Onania postica_ (back-door,\r\nposterior masturbation),—like the cobbler at Vienna, who to allay the\r\nPrurigo ani (itching of the anus) pushed his hammer up his posterior,\r\nand then alas! could not pull it out again. In the same way the\r\nSiphnians used the fingers[260].\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Italy were according to _Suidas_ (under the name\r\nΘάμυρις—Thamyris) inventors of paederastia; and Etruscans, Samnites and\r\nMessapians, as well as the Greeks dwelling in Magna Graecia, lay under\r\nthe reproach of practising the most vicious forms of love with men and\r\nviolation of boys[261]. In all probability the vice spread from here to\r\nRome, where it is found as early as the year 433 A.U.C.[262]. To such\r\nan extent did it increase that in 585 A.U.C. (B.C. 169), as _Meier_ has\r\ndemonstrated, the _Lex Scantinia_ had to be passed against it. Yet all\r\nthis amounted as yet to nothing in comparison with the scenes of horror\r\nthat were enacted under the Emperors _Tiberius_, _Caligula_, etc., of\r\nwhom _Martial_[263] says:\r\n\r\n  Tanquam parva foret sexus iniuria nostri\r\n    Foedandos populo prostituisse mares[264],\r\n  Iam cunae leonis erant, ut ab ubere raptus\r\n    Sordida vagitu posceret aera puer,\r\n  Immatura dabant infandas corpora poenas.\r\n    Non tulit Ausonius talia monstra pater:\r\n  Idem qui teneris nuper succurrit ephebis,\r\n    Ne faceret steriles saeva libido viros.\r\n  Dilexere prius pueri, iuvenesque senesque:\r\n    At nunc infantes te quoque, Caesar, amant.\r\n\r\n(As though it were a small wrong done our sex to make males\r\nprostitutes[264] to be debauched by the crowd, cradles now became a\r\npart of the brothel-keeper’s stock in trade, that the baby-boy torn\r\nfrom the breast might solicit a sordid wage by his wailing, and\r\nimmature bodies paid horrible penalties. Horrors such as these the\r\ngreat Father of Italy (Domitian) would not suffer: that same good\r\nEmperor who of late came to the rescue of tender youths, that raging\r\nlust might not make men unfruitful. Heretofore boys loved him,—and\r\nyoung men and old; now the very infants too love thee, Caesar).\r\n\r\nYet this was of little avail; the vice descended from generation to\r\ngeneration, and passed on to the Christian nations, just as the Roman\r\npunishments did in their legal codes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Diseases consequent on Paederastia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 13.\r\n\r\nIf we consider, first that the contractile power of the _Sphincter ani_\r\nmuscle offered great resistance to the paederast, a resistance only to\r\nbe overcome by the exertion of considerable force, secondly that the\r\nglands of the _rectum_ exude a malodorous secretion, which under the\r\ninfluence of climate,—a subject to be dealt with more precisely later\r\non,—assumes a more or less acrid quality, it will not surprise us to\r\nfind that manifold forms of disease showed themselves in Ancient times\r\nboth among paederasts and cinaedi (pathics). These were no doubt all\r\nthe more serious in cases where the one set of organs or the other\r\nwas already morbidly affected. As to the paederast indeed the direct\r\nevidence is scanty, yet it is not entirely wanting, as may be seen from\r\nthe following Epigram of _Martial_[265]:\r\n\r\n\r\n                             IN NAEVOLUM.\r\n\r\n  _Mentula cum doleat puero, tibi_, Naevole, _culus_,\r\n        Non sum divinus, sed scio quid facias.\r\n\r\n(To Naevolus.—When I see _pained and sore the boy’s penis and your\r\nposterior_, Naevolus,—I’m no wizard, but I know what it is you do).\r\nHere we see both parts suffering from disease, the paederast in his\r\npenis, the pathic in his posterior: and _Martial_ concludes Naevolus\r\nwas a _cinaedus_.\r\n\r\nBut more especially must phimosis and paraphimosis have had a tendency\r\nto be set up in the case of the paederast. These at first, because\r\nthe continuous state of erection of the _penis_ which is a feature of\r\nthese affections was obviously the most visibly conspicuous symptom,\r\nwere designated by the name Satyriasis, the usual appellation of the\r\nlatter condition. This will also give a probable explanation of the\r\nmortality from this cause observed by _Themison_ in _Crete_[266],—a\r\nlocality notorious, as we have seen, for the dishonouring of boys,—and\r\ngenerally for the frequency of Satyriasis, which often took an almost\r\nepidemic character in that island. Paraphimosis it should be noted\r\nin passing had already been only too frequently noted as affecting\r\nmasturbators. Physicians indeed say nothing as to the predisposing\r\ncauses, and explain the disease as arising from an _Acrimonia humorum_\r\n(Acridness of the humours) or from drinking a Philtre (Love-potion).\r\n_Naumann_[267] appears to wish to make the Satyriasis that prevailed\r\nin Crete some form of leprous affection, but for this view we can find\r\nabsolutely no ground.\r\n\r\nMuch more frequent mention is found of affections of the _rectum_ among\r\nthe pathics as consequences of paederastia. First come fissures, and in\r\ntheir train ulcers of the _rectum_; whence the expressions _sectus_,\r\n_percisus_ (cut), and the like are applied so often in Roman writers to\r\nthe pathic, and to his vice generally. So _Martial_[268] says:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              IN CARINUM.\r\n\r\n  _Secti podicis usque ad umbilicum_\r\n  Nullas reliquias habet Carinus,\r\n  Et prurit tamen usque ad umbilicum.\r\n  O quanta scabie miser laborat!\r\n  Culum non habet, est tamen cinaedus.\r\n\r\n(To Carinus.—Carinus has no relics left of _his fundament, cut up\r\nto the very navel_; and yet he itches with desire up to the very\r\nnavel. Oh! what a vile itch torments the unhappy man! He possesses no\r\nposterior, and nevertheless is a cinaedus (pathic).)\r\n\r\n\r\n                           IN LESBIAM[269].\r\n\r\n  De cathedra quoties surgis, jam saepe notavi,\r\n    _Paedicant miseram_, Lesbia, _te tunicae.\r\n  Quas cum conata es dextra, conata sinistra\r\n    Vellere, cum lacrimis eximis et gemitu._\r\n  Sic constringuntur gemina Symplegade culi,\r\n    Et Minyas intrant Cyaneasque nates.\r\n  Emendare cupis _vitium deforme_? docebo.\r\n    Lesbia, nec surgas censeo, nec sedeas!\r\n\r\n(To Lesbia.—As oft as you rise from your chair, Lesbia, I have many\r\na time noticed the fact, _your undergarments, poor lady, play the\r\npaederast with you. You endeavour to pluck them away first with the\r\nright, anon with the left hand; finally you release them with tears\r\nand groaning_. So drawn together are the twin Symplegades of your\r\nfundament, and enter in between Minyan and Cyanean buttocks. Would you\r\nfain cure _this ungraceful defect_? I will tell you how: I think,\r\nLesbia, you’d better not get up, nor yet sit down!)\r\n\r\nUsually indeed the Pathic tried to conceal his complaint, and to make\r\nit pass under some other name, as does Charisianus:\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DE CHARISIANO[270].\r\n\r\n  Multis jam, Lupe, posse se diebus\r\n  Paedicare negat Charisianus.\r\n  Caussam cum modo quaererent sodales:\r\n  _Ventrem_, dixit, _habere se solutum_.\r\n\r\n(On Charisianus.—Charisianus says, Lupus, that for many days he has\r\nbeen unable to indulge in paederastia. When his comrades asked the\r\nreason; _his bowels_, he said, _were relaxed_!)\r\n\r\nBut most frequently of all are the fig-like swellings on the fundament\r\n(Ficus, Mariscae,—figs, large figs) mentioned by Ancient authors as a\r\nconsequence of paederastia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          DE SE PRIAPUS[271].\r\n\r\n  Non sum de fragili dolatus ulmo;\r\n  Nec quae stat rigida supina vena,\r\n  De ligno mihi quolibet columna est,\r\n  Sed viva generata de cupresso.—\r\n  Hanc, tu quisquis es, o malus, timeto:\r\n  Nam si vel minimos manu rapaci\r\n  Hoc de palmite laeseris racemos:\r\n  _Nascetur_, licet hoc velis negare,\r\n  _Inserta tibi ficus a cupresso_.\r\n\r\n(Priapus on Himself.—I am not hewn of fragile elm, nor is my pillar\r\nthat stands bent back with penis stiffly erect of any chance wood, but\r\nborn of the living cypress.—Beware this image, thief, whoe’er thou\r\nart; for should you damage with plundering hand the tiniest clusters\r\nof this stem, _there shall grow a fig_, deny it if you will, _of\r\ncypress-wood inserted up your fundament_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DE LABIENO[272].\r\n\r\n  Ut pueros emeret Labienus, vendidit hortos,\r\n    Nil nisi _ficetum_ nunc Labienus habet.\r\n\r\n(On Labienus.—To buy boys Labienus sold his gardens; nought but a\r\n_fig-garden_ does Labienus now possess.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AD CAECILIANUM[273].\r\n\r\n  Cum dixi _ficus_, rides quasi barbara verba.\r\n    Et dici _ficos_, Caeciliane, iubes.\r\n  Dicemus _ficus_, quas scimus in arbore nasci,\r\n    Dicemus _ficos_, Caeciliane, _tuos_.\r\n\r\n(To Caecilianus.—When I have said _ficus_, you laugh, Caecilianus, as\r\nthough I had committed a solecism, and declare _ficos_ should be the\r\nword. We will say _ficus_, meaning the figs that we know grow on the\r\ntree, but your figs, Caecilianus, we will call _ficos_).\r\n\r\nNow too we shall understand the _medico ridente_ (the doctor grinning)\r\nin the following passage of _Juvenal_ (II. 12):\r\n\r\n                    Sed podice laevi\r\n  Caeduntur _tumidae_, medico ridente, _mariscae_.\r\n\r\n(But from your smooth posterior are cut, the doctor grinning the while,\r\n_the bloated swellings_). Just as it admits of no doubt that in the\r\npassage of _Horace_[274]:\r\n\r\n  Nam, displosa sonat quantum vesica, pepedi\r\n      Diffissa nate _ficos_.\r\n\r\n(For as loud as a burst bladder sounds, I farted my swellings\r\n(ficos—figs) away, splitting the rump), _ficos_ and not as commonly\r\n_ficus_ must be read.\r\n\r\nThat these morbid growths were not entirely free from contagious matter\r\nseems to be indicated by the following passages. In the _Priapeia_\r\n(Carm. 50) we read:\r\n\r\n  Quaedam, si placet hoc tibi, Priape,\r\n  Ficosissima me puella ludit,\r\n  Et non dat mihi, nec negat daturam;\r\n  Causasque invenit usque differendi.\r\n  Quae si contigerit fruenda nobis,\r\n  Totam cum paribus, Priape, nostris\r\n  Cingemus tibi mentulam coronis.\r\n\r\n(A certain girl, if it please you to listen, Priapus, is playing with\r\nme. Most sorely afflicted is she with swellings; and she will not give\r\nherself to me, yet does not say she never will, and ever finds excuses\r\nfor putting off and putting off. Now if ever she shall be mine to\r\nenjoy, I and my comrades with me, will wreath all thy _penis_, Priapus,\r\nwith garlands). The girl, who was badly affected with these swellings,\r\nand that presumably in the secret parts, refuses her lover coition. The\r\nlatter does not insist, but prays to Priapus, as was habitually done\r\nin all cases of affections of the genitals (see p. 74 above) and vows\r\nto deck his penis with garlands. It follows that the lover was aware\r\nthese swellings would be injurious to him, if he should constrain the\r\ngirl, of whom the poet says, _nec negat daturam_ (yet does not say she\r\nwill _not_ give herself), to lie with him. Still clearer evidence of\r\nthis may be found in the following Epigram of _Martial_, where a whole\r\nfamily is affected with these swellings or tumours:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    De familia ficosa.[275]\r\n\r\n  Ficosa est uxor, ficosus et ipse maritus,\r\n    Filia ficosa est, et gener atque nepos.\r\n  Nec dispensator, nec villicus, _ulcere turpi_,\r\n    Nec rigidus fossor, sed nec arator eget.\r\n  Cum sint ficosi pariter iuvenesque senesque,\r\n    Res mira est, ficus non habet unus ager.\r\n\r\n(On a tumourous household.—The goodwife is tumourous, tumourous the\r\ngoodman her husband, tumourous the daughter of the house, and the\r\nson-in-law and the grandson. Neither house-steward nor factor is free\r\nof the foul ulcer, nor the rugged ditcher, nor yet the ploughman. Now\r\nwhen all alike, young and old have tumours (ficos, ficus), the strange\r\nthing is, not a single field has fig-trees (ficus)). For the rest\r\nthe words _ulcere turpi_ (foul ulcer) show that _ficus_, like σύκος\r\nand σύκωσις (fig, fig-like swelling) in Greek, signifies not only a\r\nfig-shaped swelling, but also an ulcer with granulous surface, like\r\na fig cut in two. Or possibly it would be better to understand here\r\nswellings that have passed into the ulcerated stage[276].\r\n\r\nSeeing how plainly the passages just quoted from non-medical Writers\r\npoint to these swellings being a consequence of paederastia, it is\r\nsurprising that not one of the Ancient physicians, spite of _Juvenal’s_\r\n_medico ridente_ (the doctor grinning the while), ever so far as we\r\nknow, alleges this form of licentiousness as cause of affections of the\r\nsort. On the other hand we cannot help remarking that the frequency of\r\nthese swellings in the time of _Martial_ and _Juvenal_ can hardly be\r\nexplained as arising solely from the general prevalence of paederastia.\r\nMore probably, then as now, the _Genius epidemicus_ (Epidemic\r\ninfluences) bore no unimportant share in bringing about the result,\r\njust as was the case (see later) with _Mentagra_ (Eruption of the chin).\r\n\r\nHowever not merely primary affections of the posteriors were the\r\npunishment of the _Cinaedus_, but also secondary ones of the _mouth_\r\nand _throat_. First and foremost was hoarseness of the voice, to which\r\n_Martial_[277] alludes, when he makes the champion of the baths the\r\n_cinaedus_ Charinus speak _raucidulo ore_ (with a weak, hoarse voice).\r\nThis we find, following Reiske’s[278] indication, more explicitly\r\ndealt with in _Dio Chrysostom_[279]:—\r\n\r\n“But this is surely worth mentioning, and it is a thing no one can\r\ndeny. I mean the noteworthy fact that a disease has attacked so many\r\nin this city,—one which I used to hear of as prevailing much more\r\nfrequently with others than amongst you. What is it I mean? Even though\r\nI could explain myself no more clearly, yet you might easily guess the\r\nanswer. Do not think I am speaking of secrets, of hidden doings, when\r\nthe astounding fact itself speaks plainly enough. For there are many in\r\nthis city that are asleep, even while they walk and stand and speak;\r\nthough they may appear to most observers to be awake, yet it is not\r\nreally so.\r\n\r\n“Now they give, in my opinion, the clearest proof that they are\r\nasleep,—they snore (ῥέγχουσιν). I cannot, by heaven, express myself\r\nmore clearly with decency. True only a few of the sleepers are\r\nsuffering from the complaint I mean, and of the others it affects only\r\nthe drunken, the overfed and such as have lain ill. But I maintain\r\nthis vicious practice (ἔργον) shames the city and brands it publicly.\r\nThe grossest ignominy is brought down upon their native city by these\r\nsleepers by day, and they ought, I say, to have been expelled your\r\nborders, as has been their fate everywhere else. For it is not now\r\nand then, nor here and there, they are met with; but at all times and\r\nin all places in the city occasion may be found to threaten, scorn or\r\nderide them. For the rest the practice has actually penetrated now to\r\nboys still young, and adults that yet would fain be reputable, suffer\r\nthemselves to be led away into regarding the matter as a trifle, and if\r\nthey refrain from the decisive step, yet it was their wish to take it.\r\n\r\n“If there were a city in which wailing were to be heard all day\r\nlong, and no one could walk about in it, no! not one minute,\r\nwithout listening to the sound of lamentation, tell me, what man\r\nwould willingly stay here? Now wailing, as all agree, is a sign of\r\nunhappiness; but that other sound is the sign of shamelessness and\r\nlewdness the most scandalous. Surely one would much rather choose to\r\nassociate with unhappy men than with paederasts[280]. I might avoid\r\nlistening, if a single man were to be blowing the flute everlastingly,\r\nbut if in a particular place there is an everlasting noise of flutes,\r\nsinging or guitar-playing,—such as might be where the rocks ever ring\r\nwith the Syrens’ song,—I could not, having arrived there, endure to\r\nremain. And this unmusical and harsh tone of voice[281], what man of\r\nany virtue can abide it? If a man passes in front of a home in which\r\nhe catches the sound, he says, “Of a surety there is a brothel there!”\r\nNow what shall be said of a city where nothing _but_ this tone of voice\r\nprevails universally, so that no exception can be made of time or day\r\nor place whatever? For in streets and houses, in public places, in the\r\ntheatre and in the Gymnasium, _paederastia_ is rife[282].\r\n\r\n“Again I have never yet heard a flute-player of a morning in the city,\r\nbut this horrible sort of din is raised[283] from earliest dawn.\r\n\r\n“I do not indeed shut my eyes to the fact that it will be said I am\r\ntalking silly nonsense most likely, in making such allegations, and\r\nthat there is nothing in it. Nay! but surely you are only carrying\r\npot-herbs in your cart, and behold with indifference profusion of white\r\nbread on the road, as well as salt and fresh meat. But just consider\r\nthe thing (πρᾶγμα i. e. paederastia) in this way too: If any one of\r\nthese objectors should come into a city, where all men, when they\r\npoint to a thing, point at it with the middle finger[284], when any\r\none gives the right hand, gives it with this same gesture, and when\r\nhe stretches out the hand, as the people does in voting or the judges\r\nin giving decisions, does so in the same way, what, pray will he think\r\nof such a city? What, if further all men walk in this city with skirts\r\nup-raised, as if wading in a quagmire? For do you not really and truly\r\nknow what has given occasion to the defamation you suffer; what it\r\nis has offered matter to such as are unfriendly disposed to you for\r\ncensure on our city? Tell me, what is the reason they nickname you\r\n“hawks” (κερκίδες)[285]?\r\n\r\n“Well, but you opine the question is not what others say of you, but\r\nwhat you really do yourselves? Good; but if a single disease of such\r\na sort attacks a people that they all of them acquire women’s voices,\r\nand no man, neither stripling nor grey-beard, can utter a word in a\r\nman’s voice, is not this a horrible thing, and harder to bear, I should\r\nsuppose, than any Plague? For it is not _shameful_ to have a fever, nor\r\neven to die.\r\n\r\n“Nay! but to speak with women’s voice is after all to speak with human\r\nvoice, and no one is filled with aversion when he hears a woman. But,\r\ntell me, whose is this voice; does it not belong to the _Androgyni_\r\n(men-women), the Cinaedi? or to such as have had the genitals\r\namputated? True it is not invariably found with all such, but it is\r\ncharacteristic of them and a sign of what they are.\r\n\r\n“Well then! suppose a stranger from a distance to judge from your\r\nvoices, what kind of men you are, and what are your pursuits\r\n(πράττειν,—what it is you do). You are not fit, I tell you, to be\r\nneatherds or shepherds. I wonder would any one take you for descendants\r\nof the Argives, as you profess to be, or indeed for Greeks at all,—you\r\nwho outdo the Phoenicians in lubricity? At any rate I do think it would\r\nbehove a man of any morality in such a city to close his ears with wax\r\nfar more than if he were sailing past the Syrens’ shore. There he would\r\nrun the risk of death, but here of foulest licence, of violation, of\r\nthe vilest seduction.\r\n\r\n“Once Ionic harmony was in vogue, or Doric, or yet another sort, the\r\nPhrygian and Lydian, now it is the music of Aradus and the Phoenician\r\nmodes that please you; you love this rhythm _par excellence_,\r\nas others do the Spondaic. Was ever a race of men that were good\r\nmusicianers—through the nose?!\r\n\r\n(p. 409). “But such a rhythm must needs have something to follow. You\r\nwould seem not to know what; just as with other nations the wrath\r\nof the gods overtook some single part, the hands, the feet or the\r\nface[286], in the same way among you an endemic disease has attacked\r\nthe nose. Just as the angry Aphrodité they say made the Lemnian women’s\r\narmpits abominable, know now that the gods in their anger have played\r\nhavoc with the noses of most of your fellow citizens, and that is why\r\nthey have this characteristic voice of their own. Indeed from where\r\nelse could it have come?\r\n\r\n“But _I_ say this thing is the mark of most infamous lewdness, of most\r\ninfamous madness, of contempt for all decency (all morality), and (a\r\nproof) of the fact that there is no more any single thing held to be\r\ndisgraceful. Their speech, their gait, their look, proclaim it.”\r\n\r\nFrom this passage of Dio Chrysostom, who lived at the end of the First\r\nand beginning of the Second Century A.D., we see that at that period\r\nthe vice of paederastia prevailed at Tarsus to an appalling extent;\r\nand very possibly it is this circumstance that gave occasion to the\r\ndeclaration of the Apostle St. Paul[287], whose native town of course\r\nTarsus was, when he says:\r\n\r\n“Wherefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto\r\nuncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonoured among\r\nthemselves.... For their women[288] changed the natural use into\r\nthat which is against nature; and likewise also the men, leaving the\r\nnatural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another,\r\nmen with men working unseemliness, and receiving in themselves that\r\nrecompense of their error which was due.” This recompense was no doubt\r\nthe ῥέγχειν (snoring), which according to _Reiske_ was the consequence\r\nof an affection of the throat and nose in which the breath was exhaled\r\nwith a characteristic noise. To corroborate this view he quotes in\r\nhis edition of Dio Chrysostom the following passage from _Ammianus\r\nMarcellinus_[289], who picturing the habits of the Romans in the\r\nmiddle of the Fourth Century, wrote thus: “Haec nobilium instituta. Ex\r\nturba vero imae sortis et pauperrimae, in tabernis aliqui pernoctant\r\nvinariis: nonnulli velabris umbraculorum theatralium latent, quae\r\nCampanam imitatus lasciviam Catulus in aedilitate sua suspendit omnium\r\nprimus; aut pugnaciter aleis certant, _turpi sono fragosis naribus\r\nintrorsum reducto spiritu concrepantes_.” (Such are the usages of the\r\nnobles. But of the masses, those of lowest and poorest lot, certain\r\nspend the night in wine-taverns, some lurk under the curtains of the\r\ntheatre awnings,—which Catulus in his aedileship, imitating Campanian\r\nluxury, was the very first to erect; or quarrel and fight at dice,\r\n_making an ugly rattling sound the while by drawing in the breath\r\nthrough their rough nostrils_).\r\n\r\nNow we know that paederasts had foul breaths, as _Martial_[290] indeed\r\nnoted, consequently the mucous membrane of the mouth was morbidly\r\naffected in its action, and further that they spoke _raucidulo ore_\r\n(with hoarse voice)[291], which must have been with many the ordinary\r\nconsequence of a thickening of the tissues by previous ulceration; and\r\nat this fact this Speech of Dio Chrysostom, as _Reiske_ understands it,\r\nmay very well hint. But to take the main gist of his speech, the author\r\nof the “Tarsica” signifies by ῥέγχειν (to snort) something quite\r\ndifferent from this, as the whole context shows clearly.\r\n\r\nIt was in fact a signal or mode of solicitation, by which the\r\npathics sought to allure the paederasts to them and invited them\r\nto lewdness, as comes out more plainly in the following passage of\r\n_Clemens Alexandrinus_[292]: Αἱ δὲ _ἀνδρογύνων συνουσίαις_ ἥδονται·\r\nπαρεισῥέουσιν δὲ ἔνδον κιναίδων ὄχλοι, ἀθυρόγλωσσοι· μιαροὶ μὲν τὰ\r\nσώματα, μιαροὶ δὲ τὰ φθέγματα, εἰς ὑπουργίας ἀκολάστους ἠνδρωμένοι,\r\nμοιχείας διάκονοι, κιχλίζοντες καὶ ψιθυρίζοντες, καὶ _τὸ πορνικὸν\r\nἀναίδην εἰς ἀσέλγειαν διὰ ῥινῶν ἐπιψοφοῦντες ἐπικιναίδισμα_, ἀκολάστοις\r\nῥήμασι καὶ σχήμασι τέρπειν πειρώμενοι, καὶ εἰς γέλωτας ἐκκαλούμενοι,\r\nπορνείας παράδρομον· ἔστι δ’ ὅτε καὶ ὑπεκκαιόμενοι διὰ τὴν τυχοῦσαν\r\nὄργην, ἤτοι πόρνοι αὐτοὶ ἢ καὶ κιναίδων ὄχλον εἰς ὄλεθρον ἐζηλωκότες,\r\n_ἐπικροτοῦσι τῇ ῥινὶ_, βατράχων δίκην, καθάπερ ἔνοικον τοῖς μυκτῆρσι\r\nτὴν χολὴν κεκτημένοι. (But they delight in the _assemblies of the\r\nAndrogyni_ (men-women); and crowds of pathics hurry along to join them\r\nwithin, everlasting chatterers, abominable in person and abominable in\r\nvoice; reared up to manhood for unchaste ministrations, servants of\r\nadultery; tittering and whispering, and _sounding though their nose\r\nthe debauched cinaedus’ call to shameful licentiousness_, striving to\r\nplease with indecent words and gestures, and challenging to laughter, a\r\nrace and competition in harlotry. Then again at times kindled by some\r\nchance gust of anger, whether debauchees themselves or roused to a\r\nfatal emulation with the crowd of pathics, they make a rattling sound\r\nwith the nose, like frogs, as though they kept their stock of gall up\r\ntheir nostrils).\r\n\r\nBut possibly the Tarsians were also _Fellatores_ (ii qui penem alienum\r\nin os admittunt, ibique eo sugunt ut voluptas quaedam libidinosa\r\nparetur,—those who allow another’s penis to be put in their mouth,\r\nand suck it) (see later), and snorted as _fellatores_ did at their\r\ntask,—for the word ῥέγχειν (to snort) is manifestly used in several\r\ndifferent senses. It only remains to mention that a _pale complexion_\r\nwas also reckoned one of the signs of a _Cinaedus_, a fact to which\r\n_Juvenal’s_ (II. 50.) words refer: _Hippo subit iuvenes et morbo pallet\r\nutroque_. (Hippo submits to men, and is pale with two-fold disease). Of\r\nthese marks of the _Cinaedus_ we shall speak in greater detail directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Νοῦσος Θήλεια (Feminine Disease)[293].\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 14.\r\n\r\nThe passage of _Dio Chrysostom_ discussed in the preceding section\r\nbrings us, in virtue of a variety of hints it contains, to the much\r\ncanvassed Νοῦσος Θήλεια (feminine disease) of the Scythians. _Stark_\r\nhas collected with the greatest care everything that has so far been\r\nadduced by different authors in explanation of the subject; and on his\r\nWork we must base our own efforts in the investigations that follow.\r\n\r\n_Herodotus_[294] relates how the Scythians had made themselves masters\r\nof all Asia, and how some of them on their homeward march had plundered\r\nthe very ancient temple of _Venus Urania_ at Ascalon, a town of Syria;\r\nand then proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n“On such of the Scythians as plundered the temple at Ascalon, and on\r\ntheir posterity for successive generations, the goddess inflicted the\r\nθήλεια νούσος—feminine disease. And the Scythians say themselves it\r\nis for this cause they suffer the sickness, and moreover that any who\r\nvisit the Scythian country may see among them what is the condition\r\nof those whom the Scythians call Ἐναρέες”. (a Scythian word, probably\r\nhaving the same meaning as Greek ἀνδρόγυνοι—men-women).\r\n\r\nThe different views that have been formulated at different times as to\r\nthe nature of the νοῦσος θήλεια may be readily classified as follows.\r\nIt was regarded as:—\r\n\r\n1. _a Vice_, this vice being,\r\n\r\na) _Paederastia_; manifestly the oldest explanation,—already alluded\r\nto by _Longinus_, but specially championed by _Bouhier_[295], also\r\nentertained by the interpreters of _Longinus_, _Toll_ and _Pearce_, as\r\nwell as by _Casaubon_ (Epistolae) and _Costar_[296];\r\n\r\nb). Onanism (Self Masturbation),—a view _Sprengel_[297] is inclined to\r\ndecide in favour of.\r\n\r\n2. _a bodily Disease_,—to wit,\r\n\r\na). _Haemorrhoids_ (Piles); an opinion maintained by _Paul Thomas de\r\nGirac_[298], _Valckenaar_ in his Notes to Herodotus, _Bayer_[299], and\r\nthe authors of the “General History of the World”[300];\r\n\r\nb). _actual Menstruation_, for which _le Fèvre_ and _Dacier_ would seem\r\nto have declared;\r\n\r\nc). _Gonorrhoea_ (Clap), which _Patin_[301], _Hensler_[302] and\r\n_Degen_[303] understood to be meant;\r\n\r\nd). _actual loss of the Testicles, true Eunuchs_, _Mercurialis_[304]\r\nconsidered must have been implied; and with this view _Stark’s_\r\nconclusion in part coincides, who understood a disease involving\r\ncomplete loss of virile power, both corporeal and mental, and producing\r\nan actual metamorphosis of the male type into the female.\r\n\r\n(3). _a mental Disease_, in fact a form of Melancholia. This is the\r\nview adopted by _Sauvages_[305], _Heyne_, _Bose_, _Koray_[306] and\r\n_Friedreich_.\r\n\r\nIt would naturally be our task to examine the reasons alleged for\r\nand against these separate views. Supposing however we succeed in\r\nsatisfactorily proving one of them to be the right one, then _ipso\r\nfacto_ all the rest come to nothing; and so we propose here to essay\r\nthe advocacy of the oldest of them,—the view that makes the νοῦσος\r\nθήλεια to be the vice of paederastia. _En passant_ we must call\r\nattention to the fact that under the name of paederastia must be\r\nunderstood not only the vicious habit of the paederast pure and simple,\r\nof the man that is who _practices_ the act, but also of the _pathic_,\r\nwho offers opportunities for its commission. This is a point which\r\nabove all others has been quite left out of sight by the adversaries of\r\nthe view in question.\r\n\r\nThe next question we have to answer would seem to be this: Could\r\npaederastia be regarded as a consequence of the vengeance of Venus?\r\nAs it is the Scythians that are in question, the first thing would\r\nnaturally appear to be to determine what conception the Scythians had\r\nof Venus. But inasmuch as the data are lacking for any demonstration\r\nof the sort, while the Scythians themselves ascribe the νοῦσος θήλεια\r\nto the vengeance of Venus, we may very well refer for a reply to this\r\nfirst question to the general character of the cult of the goddess[307]\r\nand what has been said on the whole subject above; and herein there\r\nseems to exist no reason why we should not answer the query asked above\r\nin the affirmative. Granted that Venus was regarded as goddess of\r\nfruitfulness or as dispenser of the joys of Love, then in either aspect\r\nit was but natural she should withdraw the marks of her favour from\r\nthe culprits (the paederasts). These neither wished for posterity nor\r\nenjoyed the delights connected with _natural_ coition, but were equally\r\nindifferent towards the one and towards the other[308]; and the first\r\nsign of the vengeance of the goddess consists in the withdrawal of her\r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\nHow _Stark_, following the lead of an anonymous French author quoted\r\nby _Larcher_[309], can maintain there is no question of punishment\r\nhere, as in that case Venus would be acting against her own interest,\r\nwe fail to understand; and _Larcher_ himself calls this unknown writer\r\n_un homme d’esprit, mais peu instruit_ (witty but superficial). This\r\nis proof sufficient in our opinion that only a jest is intended, but\r\none that _Stark_, p. 7 (notes 19 and 20.), has taken with the utmost\r\nseriousness.\r\n\r\nHowever our view is _directly_ supported by another myth, which _Dio\r\nChrysostom_ mentions, speaking of the sweating at the armpits with\r\nwhich the Lemnian women were afflicted. According to this legend Venus\r\npunishes the women of Lemnos[310]:\r\n\r\n“Haec Dea veluti etiam ceteri, sua sacrificia praetermitti non\r\naequo animo ferebat: quae cum Lemniae mulieres Veneris sacrificia\r\nsprevissent, Deae maxime iram in se concitasse creditae sunt, quod\r\netiam non impune putantur fecisse. _Nam tantum foetorem illis excitasse\r\nfeminis Dea perhibetur, ut a suis maritis contemnerentur._” (This\r\ngoddess, no less than other deities, could not bear the neglect of her\r\nproper sacrifices with equanimity. Thus the women of Lemnos, having\r\nomitted to perform these sacrifices of Venus, are believed to have\r\nbrought down on themselves the most serious anger of the goddess,\r\nand this they are accounted not to have done with impunity. _For\r\nthe goddess, as is related, caused such a foul odour to arise among\r\nthe women, that they were scorned by their husbands._) If the view\r\nmentioned just above as taken by the Apostle Paul and by St. Athanasius\r\nis the right one, it would seem that the Lemnian women had suffered\r\nthemselves to be used by their husbands for purposes of paederastia;\r\nthen as a consequence there had been set up the evil odour of the mouth\r\nand breath, and this had driven the men to desert their wives to live\r\nwith the captive Thracian slave-women (_Apollonius_).\r\n\r\nBut indeed the Ancients generally, or at any rate the Greeks and\r\nRomans, seem to have always held the opinion that unnatural coition,\r\nas well as all the similar forms of indulgence taking its place, were\r\na consequence of the wrath of Venus, against whom the individuals had\r\noffended[311]. This appears also from the play of _Philoctetes_, of\r\nwhom the _Scholiast_ to _Thucydides_[312] says: “Moreover Philoctetes,\r\nhaving on account of the death of Paris fallen sick of the _feminine\r\ndisease_, and being unable to bear the shame of it, left his country\r\nand founded a city, which in memory of his misfortune he named\r\nMalacia—Effeminacy.” _Martial_[313] had the same myth in his mind when\r\nhe wrote:\r\n\r\n                  In Sertorium\r\n\r\n  Mollis erat, facilisque viris Paeantius heros,\r\n    Vulnera sic Paridis dicitur ulta Venus.\r\n  Cur lingat cunnum Siculus Sertorius, hoc est,\r\n    Ex hoc occisus, Rufe, videtur Eryx.\r\n\r\n(To Sertorius.—The Hero, son of Paeas (Philoctetes), was effeminate\r\nand easy of access to men; in this way Venus is said to have avenged\r\nthe murder of Paris. Why should Sicilian Sertorius lick the pudendum\r\nof women? this is why, because it would appear, he was the slayer,\r\nRufus, of a man of Eryx.) Of course there can be no question here of\r\nthe disease which detained Philoctetes at Lemnos and prevented his\r\ntaking part in the expedition to Troy; and if the older legend says\r\nnothing as to the νοῦσος θήλεια of Philoctetes, it is clear from this\r\n(as Meier, loco citato, has shown) that only in times when paederastia\r\nwas becoming prevalent, were all these legends invented, to get as it\r\nwere a sort of excuse by alleging a distinguished predecessor in the\r\npractice. So _Martial_ says, addressing _Gaurus_:[314]\r\n\r\n  Quod nimio gaudes noctem producere vino,\r\n    Ignosco: vitium, Gaure, Catonis habes.\r\n  Carmina quod scribis Musis et Apolline nullo,\r\n    Laudari debes: hoc Ciceronis habes.\r\n  Quod vomis: Antoni, quod luxuriaris: Apici;\r\n    Quod fellas—vitium dic mihi, cuius habes?\r\n\r\n(That you love to prolong the night with excess of wine, I can excuse;\r\nyou have the vice, Gaurus, of Cato. That you write verses with no\r\ninspiration of Muses and Apollo, for this, you should be praised; it\r\nis a fault of Cicero’s you have. That you vomit, well! ’twas a habit\r\nof Antony’s; that you are a gourmand, ’twas Apicius’ weakness.—That\r\nyou suck (as a _fellator_), whose vice have you here, pray tell me!)\r\nThe above Epigram of _Martial’s_ (To Sertorius) shows very clearly\r\nhow the poets represented each form of unnatural indulgence of the\r\nsexual impulse as vengeance of Venus. It is a _cunnilingus_ that is\r\nin question here, and his vice is accounted for in this way:—just as\r\nPhiloctetes on account of the slaying of Paris had been punished by\r\nVenus with paederastia, so the Sicilian Sertorius probably became a\r\n_cunnilingus_ because he had killed an inhabitant of Eryx, where was\r\nsituated a famous temple of the goddess. Similarly it will not surprise\r\nus if besides paederastia Philoctetes was saddled with the vice of\r\nOnanism at a later period, as is implied in the following poem of\r\n_Ausonius_:[315]\r\n\r\n            SUBSCRIPTUM PICTURAE CRISPAE MULIERIS IMPUDICAE\r\n\r\n  Praeter legitimi genitalia foedera coetus,\r\n  Repperit obscoenas Veneres vitiosa libido.\r\n  _Herculis haeredi quam Lemnia suasit egestas_,\r\n  Quam toga facundi scenis agitavit Afrani,\r\n  Et quam Nolanis capitalis luxus inussit;\r\n  Crispa tamen cunctas exercet corpore in uno:\r\n  Deglubit, fellat, molitur per utramque cavernam,\r\n  Ne quid inexpertum frustra moritura relinquat.\r\n\r\n(Inscribed beneath a Portrait of Crispa,—an immodest woman.—Over and\r\nabove the natural modes of intercourse in legitimate coition, vicious\r\nlust has discovered impure ways of love: the way that his loneliness\r\nat Lemnos taught the heir of Hercules (Philoctetes), that which the\r\ncomedies of eloquent Afranius displayed on the stage, and that which\r\ndeadly luxury branded on the men of Nola. But Crispa practises them all\r\nin her sole person: she skins, she sucks, she works by either aperture,\r\nthat she may not leave anything untried, and so have lived in vain!)\r\n\r\nNo doubt _Stark_, p. 19, is quite right in saying this passage has\r\nnothing to do with the θήλεια νοῦσος; but the poet has by no means,\r\nas he puts it in his note, _temporum ordine lapsus_,—committed an\r\nanachronism. He makes no mention whatever of any vengeance of Venus,\r\nsaying nothing more than that loneliness led the inheritor (of\r\nthe arrows) of Hercules to Onanism. This is not merely advancing\r\na conjecture, as _Stark_ does, but (to say nothing of the _Lemnia\r\negestas_—Lemnian loneliness), admits of being legitimately developed\r\nfrom the whole sequence of thought in the Epigram. Crispa’s vices are\r\nmentioned in the order of their shamefulness. The least disgraceful is\r\nOnanism, such as Philoctetes practised, next comes the vice of the\r\n_cinaedus_ and of the _pathic_, for which Afranius serves as example,\r\nand lastly _fellation_. Thus it shows a complete want of comprehension,\r\nwhen the commentators quote the scholion to Thucydides given a little\r\nabove as an explanation. Had Philoctetes been referred to as a\r\n_pathic_, the succeeding verse would be entirely superfluous; which\r\nverse does not receive a word of notice from the expositors, presumably\r\nbecause they failed to understand the allusion. The true explanation is\r\nafforded by a passage in _Quintilian_:[316] “Togatis excellit Afranius,\r\n_utinamque non inquinasset argumenta puerorum foedis amoribus_, mores\r\nsuos fassus.” (Afranius excels in _fabulae togatae_ (polite comedies),\r\nand it were to be wished he had not defiled his plots by disgusting\r\nintrigues with boys, thereby discovering his own morals). _Forberg_,\r\nloco citato p. 283, quotes this passage indeed, but explains (both here\r\nand on p. 343) the _libido_ (lust) of Philoctetes as being that of the\r\n_pathic_.\r\n\r\nTo prove that Venus manifested her wrath in the way specified, we may\r\nfurther cite the race of the daughters of Helios, whom she punished by\r\nthe infliction of licentious love. Thus _Hyginus_ says:[317] Soli ob\r\nindicium (concubitus cum Marte) Venus ad _progeniem_ eius semper fuit\r\ninimica, (Because of the Sun’s revelation (of her intrigue with Mars)\r\nVenus was ever a bitter enemy of his posterity); and Seneca:[318]\r\n\r\n  Stirpem perosa Solis invisi Venus\r\n  Per nos catenas vindicat Martis sui\r\n  Suasque: _probris_ omne Phoebeum genus\r\n  Onerat _infandis_.\r\n\r\n(Venus, loathing the posterity of the hated Sun, punishes on us the\r\nfetters that bound her lover Mars and her. _With abominable and\r\ndisgraceful practices_ she afflicts the whole race of Phoebus).\r\n\r\nAn example of such vengeance is afforded by Pasiphaë, of whom\r\nthe Scholiast on the passage of Lucian cited below relates how,\r\nἩλίου οὖσα ἐκ μήνιδος Ἀφροδίτης ταύρου ἠράσθη, (being a\r\ndaughter of the Sun, she became enamoured of a bull through the\r\ninfluence of angry Aphrodité), a fable which might very well be\r\nexplained—for ταύρος (a bull), like κένταυρος (a Centaur), occurs\r\nin the sense of paederast—as meaning that she had become a female\r\npathic. So Theomnestus says in _Lucian_:[319] “So lecherous a look\r\nresides in the eyes, that compelling all beauty to its will, it can\r\nfind no satiety. And often was I uncertain whether this were not some\r\nspite of Aphrodité. Yet am I none of the children of Helios, neither\r\na natural heir of the Lemnian women, nor puffed up with the scornful\r\ninsensibility of Hippolytus, that I could have provoked against me such\r\nan implacable hatred on the part of the goddess)”. _Philo Judaeus_[320]\r\nalso represents paederastia as a punishment of such men as married a\r\nwoman legally repudiated, and the like: πρὸς δὲ συμβάσεις εἴ τις ἐθέλοι\r\nχωρεῖν ἀνὴρ τῇ τοιαύτῃ γυναικὶ, _μαλακίας καὶ ἀνανδρίας ἐκφερέσθω\r\nδόξαν_, ὡς ἐκ τετμημένος τῆς ψυχῆς τὸ βιωφελέστατον μισοπόνηρον\r\nπάθος.... δίκην οὖν τινέτω σὺν τῇ γυναικί. (But if any man should wish\r\nto enter into contracts with such a woman, let him bear the _ill-repute\r\nof softness and effeminacy_, as having eradicated from his soul that\r\nsentiment of hatred for ill-doers which is most useful for life,—So\r\nlet him pay his penalty along with the woman). In _Athenaeus_ one\r\nof the speakers exclaims (Deipnos., XIII. p. 605 D.): Ὁρᾶτε οὖν καὶ\r\nὑμεῖς, οἱ φιλόσοφοι _παρὰ φύσιν τῇ_ Ἀφροδίτῃ χρώμενοι, καὶ _ἀσεβοῦντες\r\nεἰς τὴν θεὸν_, μὴ τὸν αὐτὸν διαφθαρῆτε τρόπον. (Beware then ye too,\r\nphilosophers who indulge the pleasures of Aphrodité _against nature,\r\nand act impiously towards the goddess_, that ye be not destroyed in the\r\nsame way).\r\n\r\nAccording to _Diodorus_ (V. 55) the sons of Neptune in consequence of\r\nthe wrath of Venus plunged into such madness that they violated their\r\nmother. The Propontides, who had denied the godhead of Venus, were cast\r\nby her into such an amorous phrenzy that they publicly gave themselves\r\nto men, and they were subsequently turned into stones.[321] Myrrha,\r\nwhose mother proclaimed herself to be fairer than Venus, was driven by\r\nthe goddess into unchastity with her own father.[322]\r\n\r\nIn later times this idea was even transferred to the Star of Venus. The\r\nfollowing appears in _Firmicus_ “In octavo ab horoscopo loco, Mercurius\r\ncum Venere, si vespertini ambo, inefficaces et apocopos reddent, et qui\r\nnihil agere possint.” (In the eighth place of the horoscope, Mercury\r\nin conjunction with Venus, if both are evening stars, will make men\r\nimpotent eunuchs and such as can effect nothing.)—a notion that first\r\narose perhaps from the name Hermaphroditus[323].\r\n\r\nThus there would be nothing inconsistent with the views universally\r\nheld in Antiquity in considering the νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine disease)\r\nof the Scythians, and equally that of Philoctetes, as consequences\r\nof the wrath of Venus. That paederastia was invariably regarded\r\nas a _Vice_ by the Ancients (and particularly by the Greeks) we\r\nhave already, following the lines laid down by _Meier_, we think\r\nsufficiently proved. _Stark_, who repeatedly (pp. 12, 16, 20.) denies\r\nthis, has been led into error merely by the mistake that was generally\r\nprevalent in his time of confusing paedophilia and paederastia; and it\r\nis on this misapprehension he bases his argument. How the Scythians\r\ncame to hold this belief that the wrath of Venus was to blame for\r\nwhat they suffered, must indeed be left an open question. But it\r\nshould be remembered it was not the _pathics_ themselves who advanced\r\nthis opinion, but only the rest of the Scythians; for Herodotus says\r\nexpressly, λέγουσί τε οἱ Σκύθαι διὰ τοῦτο _σφεας_ νοσέειν (and the\r\nScythians say that for this cause _they_ were afflicted). Again it was\r\nonly ὀλίγοι τινὲς αὐτῶν ὑπολειφθέντες (a few of the Scythians who were\r\nleft behind), a few of the stragglers, who would seem to have plundered\r\nthe temple of Aphrodité; and it certainly was only later that this act\r\nof impiety was brought into connection with the vice,—in the same way\r\nas the killing of Paris by Philoctetes was with the legend of his lewd\r\npractices.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 15.\r\n\r\nThe second question we have to answer will be this: how could Herodotus\r\nwrite _that the descendants of these few stragglers alive in his time\r\nsuffered from the νοῦσος θήλεια_ (_feminine disease_)? From the\r\nfact that, while descendants are named, strictly speaking only _male_\r\ndescendants can be in question, it is clear the statement is only a\r\ngeneral one, and must not be understood to imply more than that certain\r\nmembers of these families were Cinaedi, not of course that the _whole_\r\nposterity was afflicted with the νοῦσος θήλεια. We see at the\r\npresent day how the impurity of the father passes on to the son; so\r\nit need be matter for no surprise whatever to find the vice of the\r\ncinaedi descending in the same way among certain members of a family.\r\nAs a matter of fact these Scythian temple-robbers are by no means the\r\nonly examples Antiquity holds up to us of such a thing, for the Orator\r\n_Lysias_[324] says of the family of _Alcibiades_, that _most members of\r\nit had become prostitutes_.\r\n\r\nWhat is more, the opinion was avowedly and directly held by the\r\nAncients, that pathics were born with the predisposition to the\r\nvice. In particular _Parmenides_ (509 B.C.) expressed this view in a\r\nFragment, which _Caelius Aurelianus_[325] has preserved in a chapter of\r\nhis Work. This chapter treats solely of the vice of the pathic, and is\r\nof the greatest importance for our subject. We could not forgo quoting\r\nit in full, particularly as it is the sole authority for the views held\r\nby physicians on this vice, and up to now appears to have been entirely\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n      DE MOLLIBUS SIVE SUBACTIS; QUOS GRAECI _μαλθακοὺς_ VOCANT.\r\n\r\n“Molles sive subactos Graeci μαλθακοὺ vocaverunt, quos quidem esse\r\nnullus facile virorum credit. Non enim hoc humanos ex natura venit in\r\nmores, sed pulso pudore, libido etiam indebitas partes obscoenis usibus\r\nsubiugavit. Cum enim nullus cupiditati modus, nulla satietatis spes\r\nest, singulis Sparta non sufficit sua. Nam sic nostri corporis loca\r\ndivina providentia certis destinavit officiis. Tum denique volentes\r\nalliciunt veste atque gressu, et aliis femininis rebus, quae sunt a\r\npassionibus corporis aliena, sed potius corruptae mentis vitia. Nam\r\nsaepe tumentes [timentes], vel quod est difficile, verentes quosdam,\r\nquibus forte deferunt, repente mutati parvo tempore virilitatis\r\nquaerunt indicia demonstrare, cuius quia modum nesciunt, rursum\r\nnimietate sublati, plus quoque quam virtuti convenit, faciunt et\r\nmaioribus si peccatis involvunt. Constat itaque etiam nostro iudicio,\r\nhos vera sentire. Est enim, ut Soranus ait, malignae ac foedissimae\r\nmentis passio. Nam sicut feminae _Tribades_[326] appellatae, quod\r\nutramque Venerem exerceant, mulieribus magis quam viris misceri\r\nfestinant et easdem, invidentia pene virili sectantur, et cum passione\r\nfuerint desertae, seu temporaliter relevatae, ea quaerunt aliis\r\nobiicere, quae pati noscuntur, iuvamini humilitate [iuvandi voluptate\r\nex] duplici sexu confecta, velut frequenti ebrietate corruptae in novas\r\nlibidinis formas erumpentes, consuetudine turpi nutritae, sui sexus\r\niniuriis gaudent, illi comparatione talium animi passione iactari\r\nnoscuntur. Nam neque ulla curatio corporis depellendae passionis causa\r\nrecte putatur adhibenda, sed potius animus coercendus, qui tanta\r\npeccatorum labe vexatur. Nemo enim pruriens corpus feminando correxit,\r\nvel virilis veretri tactu mitigavit, sed communiter querelam sive\r\ndolorem alia ex materia toleravit. Denique etiam a Clodio historia\r\ncurationis data ascaridarum esse perspicitur, quos de lumbricis\r\nscribentes vermiculos esse docuimis longaonis[327] in partibus natos.\r\n_Parmenides_[328] libris quos de natura scripsit, _eventu_, inquit\r\n_conceptionis molles aliquando seu subactos homines generare_. Cuius\r\nquia graecum est epigramma et hoc versibus intimabo [imitabo]: Latinos\r\nenim, ut potui, simili modo composui, ne linguarum ratio misceretur.\r\n\r\n  Femina, virque simul Veneris cum germina miscent\r\n  Venis, informans diverso ex sanguine virtus\r\n  Temperiem servans bene condita corpora fingit.\r\n  At si virtutes permixto semine pugnent,\r\n  Nec faciant unam, permixto in corpore dirae\r\n  Nascentem gemino vexabunt semine sexum.\r\n\r\nVult enim seminum praeter materias esse virtutes, quae si se ita\r\nmiscuerint et [ut] eiusdem corporis [vim unam] faciant, unam congruam\r\nsexui generent voluntatem. Si autem permixto semine corporeo virtutes\r\nseparatae permanserint utriusque Veneris natos adpetentia sequatur.\r\nMulti praeterea sectarum principes genuinam dicunt esse passionem\r\net propterea _in posteros venire cum semine_, non quidem naturam\r\ncriminantes, quae suae puritatis metas aliis ex animalibus docet: nam\r\nsunt eius specula a sapientibus nuncupata: sed humanum genus, quod ita\r\nsemel recepta tenet vitia, ut nulla possit instauratione purgari, nec\r\nullum novitati liquerit locum, sitque gravior senescentibus mentis\r\nculpa, cum plurimae genuinae, seu adventitiae passionis corporibus\r\ninfractae consenescant, ut podagra, epilepsia, furor et propterea\r\naetate vergente mitiores procul dubio fiant. Omnia et enim vexantia\r\nvalidos effectus dabunt firmitate opposita subiacentium materiarum,\r\nquae cum in senibus deficit, passio quoque minuitur, ut fortitudo; sola\r\ntamen supra dicta, quae subactos seu molles efficit viros, senescenti\r\ncorpore gravius invalescit et infanda magis libidine movet, non quidem\r\nsine ratione. In aliis enim aetatibus adhuc valido corpore et naturalia\r\nventris [veneris] officia celebrante, gemina luxuriae libido non\r\ndivititur, animorum nunc faciendo, nunc facie iactata [animo eorum nunc\r\npatiendo nunc faciendo iactato]: in iis vero qui senectute defecti\r\nvirili veneris officio caruerint, omnis animi libido in contrariam\r\nducitur appetentiam, et propterea femina validius Venerem poscit. Hinc\r\ndenique coniiciunt plurimi etiam pueros hac passione iactari. Similiter\r\nenim senibus virili indigent officio, quod in ipsis est nondum, illos\r\ndeseruit.” (On effeminate men or _subservients_, called μαλθακοὶ—soft,\r\neffeminate, by the Greeks.—Effeminate men, or _subservients_, were\r\ncalled by the Greeks μαλθακοὶ. A _man_ finds it difficult to believe\r\nin the existence of such creatures. For it was not nature prompted the\r\nintroduction of this as part of human habits; rather was it lust that,\r\nexpelling shame, subjected to foul uses parts of the body that should\r\nnever have been so employed. For no limit being set to passion, and\r\nno hope of satiety being entertained, the several members find each\r\nits own realm insufficient; whereas divine providence destined the\r\ndifferent portions of the body to perform definite functions. In fine\r\nthey go out of their way to allure by dress and gait and other feminine\r\nattributes, things unconnected with bodily emotions, being rather due\r\nto a corrupted mind. For often, moved by fear, or (however difficult to\r\nbelieve) by shame, towards persons whom they happen to respect, they\r\nchange of a sudden and for a brief space seek to show marks of manly\r\npower; but not knowing where to put the limit, they are again carried\r\naway by excess, and going beyond what is fit for an honest man are\r\ninvolved in yet greater offences. Thus it is evident, in _our_ opinion,\r\nthat such men have a sense of the true state of things. For theirs\r\nis, as Soranus declares, the passion of a corrupt and utterly foul\r\nmind. For as women that are called _Tribades_, because they practise\r\nthe love of either sex, are eager to have intercourse with women more\r\nthan with men, and pursue these with a jealousy almost as violent as\r\na man’s, and when they have been deserted by their love or for the\r\ntime being superseded, seek to do to other women what they are known\r\nto suffer, and winning from their double sex a pleasure in giving\r\npleasure, like persons deboshed by constant drunkenness, being nurtured\r\non evil habitude, delight in wrongs to their own sex,—even so these\r\nmen (pathics) are seen by a comparison with women of this sort to be\r\ntormented with a passion that is of the mind. For no bodily treatment\r\nit is rightly deemed should be adopted to expel the passion, rather\r\nmust the mind be disciplined which is afflicted with such a pollution\r\nof vices.\r\n\r\nFor no man ever remedied a prurient body by foul practices as a woman,\r\nnor got mitigation by contact of the male member, but concurrently he\r\nsuffered some complaint or pain from a different (material) cause. So\r\nin fact the history of a cure given by Clodius is found to be really\r\na case of recovery from “ascaridae”, which writers on intestinal\r\nworms have shown are a kind of worm born in the region of the rectum\r\nor straight gut. _Parmenides_ in his books on natural science says\r\n“_Effeminate men or _subservients_ occasionally bring forth as a\r\nresult of conception_.” But as his Epigram is in Greek, I will imitate\r\nit in verse; so I have composed Latin lines like the original so\r\nfar as I could make them, that there might not be a mixture of the\r\ntwo languages:—“When a woman and a man together mingle in the veins\r\nthe seeds of love, the formative virtue that moulds of the diverse\r\nblood, if it keep due proportion, makes well-framed bodies. But if the\r\nvirtues are discordant in the commingled seed, and have no unity, in\r\nthe commingled body furies will torment the nascent sex with two-fold\r\nseed.” He means that over and above the material seed there are certain\r\nvirtues residing in it; and if these have commingled in such a way as\r\nto have one and the same operative force in the same body, then they\r\nproduce one single will that tallies with the sex. But if when the\r\nbodily seed was commingled, the virtues remained separate, the appetite\r\nfor love of both kinds must pursue the offspring.\r\n\r\nMany leading doctors of the schools moreover declare that the passion\r\nis innate, and _therefore passes on with the seed to descendants_, not\r\nindeed hereby incriminating nature, which teaches men the bounds of\r\nits purity by the example of other animals (for animals are called by\r\nwise men nature’s mirrors), but rather the human race that retains so\r\nobstinately vices once adopted, that by no renewal can it be purified,\r\nand has left no room for change. Similarly a _mental_ depravity grows\r\ngraver as men advance in life, whereas most affections of the _body_,\r\nwhether innate or adventitious, get weaker as men get older, for\r\ninstance gout, epilepsy and madness, and so as age advances undoubtedly\r\ngrow milder. For all troublesome factors will produce strong effects in\r\nproportion to the firmness to resist possessed by the affected parts,\r\nand as this firmness is deficient in old men, so the complaint or\r\npassion diminishes in intensity, as does the general strength. _But_\r\nthat passion which makes men subservient or effeminate, grows stronger\r\nand more serious as the body grows old and stirs the sufferers with yet\r\nmore abominable lustfulness,—and not without a reason. For at other\r\nages, the body being still strong and capable of performing the natural\r\noffices of love, there is no division of lust into double forms of\r\nwantonness, through their mind being tossed to and fro now by passive\r\nnow by active lewdness. But in such as have failed from age, and become\r\nincapable of the manly office of love, all the wantonness of the mind\r\nis directed on the appetite for the opposite form of gratification; and\r\nfor this cause a woman demands love more strongly than a man. In fact\r\nmany conjecture it is for this reason that boys also are tormented by\r\nthis passion. For they resemble old men in lacking power for the virile\r\nfunction. It is not yet born in boys; old men have lost it.)\r\n\r\nTo leave on one side for the present the many inferences of various\r\nsorts that this passage of _Caelius Aurelianus_ must necessarily lead\r\nus to, as they will find a more suitable place later on, and to return\r\nto our question,—the mere fact of Herodotus mentioning posterity at\r\nall ought of itself to be sufficient to negative any idea of actual\r\neunuchs, of loss of the generative power. For had the Scythians\r\nreturning from Ascalon lost this power, they could have had no more\r\ndescendants, and therefore the νούσος θήλεια could not have passed on\r\nto these, but must have become extinct with the original sufferers. On\r\nthe other hand children already begotten by them before that period\r\ncould have been in no way influenced by a disease communicable through\r\nthe act of generation. Accordingly the νοῦσος θήλεια cannot possibly\r\nhave affected _these_ Scythians so as to annihilate the power of\r\ngeneration. Both must have co-existed side by side; and the contrary\r\ncan never be proved from anything _Herodotus_ says. As to another\r\npassage of Herodotus that might seem to demand some notice here, where\r\nthe expression ἀνδρόγυνος (man-woman) is put side by side with ἐνάρεες,\r\nwe will speak subsequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 16.\r\n\r\n_But_, it is maintained by those who take a different view,—the\r\nindividuals who suffered from the νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine disease)\r\ncould be recognized as doing so by their looks; thus it cannot have\r\nbeen a mere vice, it must have been an actual bodily complaint. We\r\nwill not say a word more insisting on the declarations general amongst\r\nancient writers, for example the words of _Ovid_: _Heu! quam difficile\r\nest crimen non prodere vultu_ (Alas! how difficult it is not to betray\r\na vice by the look), but will simply ask the question,—_had the\r\nAncients really no bodily marks of identification_ by which they could\r\nrecognise in an individual the vice of the pathic or cinaedus? On this\r\npoint we must look to the Physiognomists for information, and as a\r\nmatter of fact they supply it in considerable completeness. First of\r\nall Aristotle[329]:\r\n\r\n“_Distinguishing Masks of the Cinaedus_:\r\n\r\n“An eye broken-down, as it were, knees bent inwards, inclination of the\r\nhead to the right side; movements of the hands always back downwards\r\nand flaccid, the gait double, as it were, one leg being crossed over\r\nthe other in walking, the gaze wandering; such a man for example was\r\nthe Sophist Dionysius.” Polemo enters into greater detail[330]:\r\n\r\n“_Distinguishing Marks of the Androgynus_ (_Man-woman_): “The\r\n_man-woman_ has a lecherous and wanton look, he rolls his eyes and\r\nlets his gaze wander; forehead and cheeks twitch, eyebrows are drawn\r\ntogether to a point, neck bent, hips in continual movement. All\r\nthe limbs twitch spasmodically, knees and hands seeming to crack;\r\nlike an ox he glares round him and fixes his eyes on the ground. He\r\nspeaks with a thin voice, at once croaking and shrill, exceedingly\r\nuncertain and trembling.” In very similar terms the pathic is sketched\r\nby Adamantus[331]. _Dio Chrysostom_ in his speech cited a little\r\nabove[332] relates how “a physiognomist had come into a certain city,\r\nin order to give an exhibition of his art there, and declared he could\r\ntell by looking at any individual whether he were brave or timid, a\r\nboaster or a debauchee, a cinaedus or an adulterer. A man was brought\r\nto him who had a meagre body, eyebrows grown together, a dirty look,\r\nwho was in evil condition, with callosities on his hands, and dressed\r\nin coarse gray clothing, one that was overgrown with hair to the\r\nknuckles, and ill-shaved, and the physiognomist was asked, what sort\r\nof a man he was. When he had looked at him a considerable time, and\r\nat the end was still uncertain, as it seems to me, what he should\r\nfinally say, he declared he did not know and ordered the man to go. But\r\nwhen the latter sneezed, just as he was going, he cried out instantly\r\nhe was a cinaedus. Thus the sneeze betrayed the man’s habits, and\r\nprevented them, in spite of all the rest, from continuing hid.” No\r\ndoubt the man’s walk had already given the Physiognomist an indication,\r\nand the gesture he made when he sneezed, quickly confirmed his\r\nDiagnosis. In fact the cinaedus probably made a grip at his posterior\r\nas he sneezed, so as to close the orifice, the weakened or possibly\r\nruptured _Sphincter ani_ no longer being able to perform this office\r\n(χαυνοπρώκτος,—wide-breeched, in Aristophanes!). Indeed with a healthy\r\n_Sphincter_ it is often hardly possible during a sneeze to keep back\r\nthe out-rush of wind and even of the more liquid faeces.[333]\r\n\r\nFurther the following passage of Lucian should be quoted in this\r\nconnection:[334]\r\n\r\n“But I tell you, pathic,—your habits are so obvious that even the\r\nblind and the deaf cannot fail to recognise them. If you only open\r\nyour mouth to speak, only undress at the baths, nay, if you do not\r\nyourself undress, but only your slaves put off their garments, what\r\nthink you,—are not all your secrets of the night at once revealed? Now\r\njust tell me, if your Sophist Bassus, or the flute-player Batalus, or\r\nthe cinaedus Hemitheon of Sybaris, who wrote your beautiful laws, how\r\nyou must polish the skin, and pluck out the hair (with tweezers), how\r\nyou must submit to the performance of paederastia, and how yourselves\r\nperform it,—now if one of these men should throw a lion’s skin round\r\nhim, and enter with a club in his hand, what would the spectators\r\nreally believe?—that it was Hercules? Surely not, unless they were\r\nutterly blear-eyed. A thousand things betray such a masquerade,—gait,\r\nlook, voice,[335] the bowed neck, the ceruse, the mastich, the paint on\r\nthe cheeks that you make yourselves up with; in a word it were easier,\r\nas the proverb says, to hide five elephants under your armpit than to\r\nconceal one cinaedus!”\r\n\r\nNow if the _natural_ marks of identification that have been specified\r\nwere sufficient to betray the cinaedus, even when he was devoid of all\r\nexternal adornment from art,[336] how much more readily recognizable\r\nmust the pathic become, if he arranged his get-up and costume to match\r\nhis shameful practices,[337] and that this was so _Martial_ affords\r\nevidence in countless places. In fact these male whores used to have the\r\nbeard quite clean shaven (ἐξυρημένοι close-shaven) and not merely on the\r\nposteriors but generally all over the body, with the exception of the\r\nhead, carefully removed the hair, so as make themselves more like women.\r\n\r\n  αὐτίκα γυναικεῖ’ ἢν ποιῇ τις δράματα,\r\n  μετουσίαν δεῖ τῶν τρόπων τὸ σῶμ’ ἔχειν,\r\n\r\n(Directly, if a man play women’s parts, the body must have its share\r\nin the characterization), Aristophanes makes Agatho say at the\r\nThesmophoria, where Mnesilochus has been transformed into a woman\r\nby means of depilation, so as to be able to back up the women in\r\nopposition to Euripides in their attacks on him at that festival.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand cinaedi let the hair of the head grow long[338]\r\n(comae,—long locks), and dressed altogether like women. Hence the reply\r\nof the Cynic _Diogenes_[339] to a young man clothed after this fashion,\r\nwho had asked him a question on some subject or other; he would not\r\nanswer, he said, till his questioner had lifted up his clothes, and\r\nshown him his sex! Equally important is the conversation of _Socrates_\r\nwith _Strepsiades_ in the “Clouds” of _Aristophanes_:[340]\r\n\r\n  _Στρεψιάδης_.... Λέξον δή μοι τὶ παθοῦσαι,\r\n  εἴπερ Νεφέλαι γ’ εἰσὶν ἀληθῶς, θνηταῶς εἴξασι γυναιξίν·\r\n  οὐ γὰρ ἐκεῖναί γ’ εἰσὶ τοιαῦται....\r\n\r\n  Σωκράτης. Γίγνονται πάνθ’ ὅ τι βούλονται· κᾆτ’ ἢν μὲν ἴδωσι κομήτην,\r\n  ἄγριόν τινα τῶν λασίων τούτων, οἷόν περ τὸν Ξενοφάντου,\r\n  σκώπτουσαι τὴν μανίαν αὐτοῦ, Κενταύροις ᾔκασαν αὐτάς.\r\n\r\n  Καὶ νῦν ὅτι Κλεισθένη εἶδον, ὁρᾷς, διὰ τοῦτ’ ἐγένοντο γυναῖκες.\r\n\r\n(_Strepsiades._—Now tell me, how comes it that, if these are really and\r\ntruly clouds, they resemble women? Common clouds are not like that....\r\n_Socrates._—They can easily make themselves anything they please. And\r\nso, if they but catch sight of one of those long-haired, ruffianly,\r\nshaggy fellows, such a man as Xenophantus’ son for example, straightway\r\nin derision of their folly they change into Centaurs. And now when they\r\nbeheld Cleisthenes, see you? they became women!) _Cleisthenes_ was a\r\nnotorious cinaedus at Athens, whom Aristophanes had made a special\r\nbutt for his wit; for example, he makes Mnesilochus, mentioned just\r\nabove, after his transformation into a woman, say,—he looks just like\r\nCleisthenes now.\r\n\r\nThe evidence adduced will, we think, be sufficient to show that the\r\nScythians had good reason for saying, that with persons in this case\r\n(cinaedi) it was easy to _recognise by looking at them_ what stamp of\r\nmen they were: and that _Juvenal_[341] was right when he wrote:\r\n\r\n                                Verius ergo\r\n  Et magis ingenue Peribomius: _hunc ego fatis\r\n  Imputo, qui vultu morbum incessuque fatetur_.\r\n\r\n(More truly then and more candidly Peribomius says: the man I consider\r\na victim of fate, who in face and gait betrays the disease he suffers\r\nfrom.)—a passage that strongly confirms what has been advanced.\r\nPeribomius is quite candid, he confesses to being a pathic, for in any\r\ncase his appearance would betray the fact. He finds the less reason to\r\ndeny it, as he regards the vice which has mastered him as an infliction\r\nof providence (_fatis imputo_). Here is proof that the opinion of the\r\nGreeks as to the pathic’s being one who had incurred the anger of\r\nthe gods, was still commonly held in Juvenal’s time, though perhaps\r\nless as a matter of conviction than in order to provide an excuse for\r\nindulgence. So we must further read _hoc_ for _hunc_ in the passage\r\n(_hoc ego fatis imputo_,— _this_ I regard as an infliction of fate);\r\nunless indeed we construe thus, _ego, qui morbum vultu incessuque\r\nfatetur, hunc (sc. morbum) fatis imputo_. “I in truth,—as for the man\r\nwho confesses by look and gait his disease, _this disease_ I regard\r\nas an infliction of fate.” The words are obviously Peribomius’ own\r\nexpression of opinion; and directly afterwards the poet goes on:\r\n\r\n  Horum simplicitas miserabilis, his furor ipse\r\n  Dat veniam: sed peiores, qui talia verbis\r\n  Herculis invadunt et de virtute locuti\r\n  Clunem agitant.\r\n\r\n(These men’s simplicity moves our pity; their very infatuation craves\r\npardon. But worse are they who enter such courses with Hercules’ words\r\non their lips, and prating of manly virtue, heave the wanton buttocks.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 17.\r\n\r\nBut the passage just quoted from _Juvenal_ is of still greater\r\nimportance for another reason. In it the vice of the cinaedus is\r\ncalled _morbus_ (a disease); and in virtue of its explicitness it is\r\nsufficient by itself to settle all doubts as to this being a usual\r\nmode of expression with the Romans, who ordinarily designated any\r\nvice by this name[342]. The only question remaining will be, Did the\r\n_Greeks_ also use this form of expression? Any scholar possessed of a\r\nspecial acquaintance with the Greek language will most certainly not\r\nhesitate an instant to answer this question in the affirmative, the\r\nLexicographers having long ago collected an exhaustive list of examples\r\nof such use[343].\r\n\r\n_Plutarch_[344] says, comparing the action of the Sun with that of\r\nLove:— Καὶ μὴν οὔτε σώματος ἀγύμναστος ἕξις ἥλιον, οὒτε Ἔρωτα δύναται\r\nφέρειν ἀλύπως τρόπος ἀπαιδεύτου ψυχῆς· ἐξίσταται δ’ ὁμοίως ἐκάτερον καὶ\r\n_νοσεῖ, τὴν του θεοῦ δύναμιν, οὐ τὴν αὑτοῦ μεμφόμενον ἀσθένειαν_.—(ch.\r\nXXIII.) Τὴν μὲν πρὸς ἄῤῥενα ἄῤῥενος ὁμιλίαν, μᾶλλον δὲ ἀκρασίαν καὶ\r\nἐπιπήδησιν εἴποι τις ἂν ἐννοήσας,\r\n\r\n  _Ὕβρις_ τάδ’ _οὐχ_ ἡ Κύπρις ἐξεργάζεται.\r\n\r\nΔιὸ τοὺς μὲν ἡδομένους τῷ πάσχειν εἰς τὸ χείριστον τιθέμενοι γένος\r\nκακίας, οὔτε πίστεως μοῖραν, οὔτε αἰδοῦς.... Ἀλλὰ πολλὰ φαῦλα καὶ\r\nμανικὰ τῶν γυναικῶν ἐρώτων· Τὶ δὲ οὐχὶ πλείονα τῶν παιδικῶν; Ἀλλ’\r\nὥσπερ τοῦτο παιδομανία _τὸ πάθος_, οὐδέτερον δὲ Ἔρως ἔστιν. (And in\r\nfact neither can an untrained body bear the sun, nor can any fashion\r\nof uneducated soul bear Love (Eros) without pain; but each equally is\r\ndisorganized and grows sick, having to blame the power of the god,\r\nnot its own weakness.—ch. XXIII.—Now intercourse of male with male\r\none would rather call, after due reflection, incontinence and violent\r\nassault.\r\n\r\n“’Tis _overmastering insolence_ works this result, not love\r\n(Cypris).”[345]\r\n\r\nWherefore such as take pleasure in pathic lust, devoting themselves\r\nto the vilest kind of wickedness, have no portion in honour or in\r\nmodesty.—Indeed much there is base and insane in amours with women; how\r\nmuch more so in those with boys! Now the name of the latter passion is\r\npaedomania—[346]madness for boys,—but _neither_ kind is Love—Eros).\r\n\r\nThese passages are of the highest importance in connection with our\r\nsubject, as confirming in the most distinct manner what has been said\r\nabove as to the wrath of Venus; but for the sake of greater clearness\r\nthey had to be held over for discussion till now. It is clearly stated\r\nin them: that paederastia is no work of Venus, i.e. not an expression\r\nor consequence of the customary activity of the goddess, but a ὕβρις\r\n(act of insolent violence) and the consequence of ὕβρις i.e. of some\r\nact that has roused the anger of the gods. Here we have the oldest\r\nview of all: that paederastia is a consequence of the vengeance of\r\nVenus, arising in consequence of a ὕβρις, and again in turn itself\r\nconstituting a ὕβρις.[347]\r\n\r\nBut besides this the later view of a more enlightened time is also\r\nimplied. According to this it was not any δύναμις τοῦ θεοῦ (operation\r\nof a god’s might), but simply an ἀσθενεία or ἀκρασία[348] (weakness,\r\nincontinence) of the individual that was in question, (and it is\r\nfor this reason _Plutarch_ quotes the line of _Manetho_, an old and\r\nobscure poet, in this sense); Paederastia was called a πάθος, a form\r\nof insanity (παιδομανία—madness for boys), and was not looked upon\r\nin any sense as a consequence of the power of Eros—Love. That the\r\nvice was also called νόσος (a disease) is shown,—not to mention the\r\nexpression νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine _disease_), which we have yet to\r\nfully explain,—by the Speech of Dio Chrysostom cited above, as well as\r\nby a number of passages quoted in the course of our investigation,—e.g.\r\non p. 125. In the “Wasps” of _Aristophanes_, _Xanthias_ relates how a\r\nson had confined his father and put him under surveillance, and then\r\ngoes on (vv. 71 sqq.):\r\n\r\n  _νόσον_ γὰρ ὁ πατὴρ ἀλλόκοτον αὐτοῦ _νοσεῖ _,\r\n  ἣν οὐδ’ ἂν εἷς γνοίη ποτ’ οὐδὲ ξυμβάλῃ,\r\n  εἰ μὴ πύθοιθ’ ἡμῶν· ἐπεὶ τοπάζετε·\r\n\r\n(For his father is _sick_ of a portentous _sickness_, one that no one\r\nwould ever know or conjecture the nature of, unless he should have\r\nlearned it from us; for if you doubt me, guess yourselves.)\r\n\r\nLove of play is suggested, and love of drink, love of sacrifice\r\nand finally love of winning guests and seeing them at his house\r\n(φιλόξενον—lover of guests), which last conjecture Sosias understands\r\nin an obscene sense as implying a cinaedus, and (vv. 84 sqq.) says:\r\n\r\n  μὰ τὸν κύν’, ὦ Νικόστρατ’, οὐ φιλόξενος,\r\n  ἐπεὶ καταπύγων ἐστὶν ὅγε Φιλόξενος,\r\n\r\n(No! no! by heavens! Nicostratus, not a lover of guests (φιλόξενος)\r\nfor our friend Philoxenus is a man given to unnatural lust,) where\r\nφιλόξενος and καταπύγων are explained as being synonymous. Now if\r\npaederastia had not been a disease, how should they have come to call a\r\nman φιλόξενος, when guessing the form his sickness took? For the rest\r\nthere was a well-known cinaedus Philoxenus, to whom allusion is made.\r\nThe scholiast quotes a very noteworthy line from _Eupolis_ (in the\r\n“Urbes”) or else from Phrynichus (“in the Satyrs”) as follows:\r\n\r\n  ἔστι δέ τις _θήλεια_ Φιλόξενος ἐκ Διομείων.\r\n\r\n(And there is a certain _female_ Philoxenus of Diomeia);\r\n\r\nThe healthy good sense of the Greeks could not possibly regard the vice\r\nof the Pathic otherwise than as a deviation from Nature, an _unnatural_\r\nappetite; _and_ every _unnatural_ appetite (ἀκολασία—“intemperance”)\r\nwas a νόσος or πάθος (disease, or suffering, passion), or a consequence\r\nof these, as the passages quoted from _Aristotle_ and elsewhere show\r\nconclusively. From the point of view of the paederast reasons perhaps\r\nwere to be discovered, that appeared to justify his peculiar taste; and\r\nthe mode in which he obtained the titillation of sensual pleasure was\r\nlooked upon merely as one way of getting rid of the semen, as a _figura\r\nVeneris_ (mode of Love) standing in close relationship with Onanism.\r\nThe paederast was relegated to the category of voluptuaries, but\r\nwithout his incurring any special condemnation. On the other hand for\r\nthe pathic who lent himself as subject of the vice, no excuse of this\r\nsort was forthcoming. His lust was not seen (this was impossible at the\r\ntime) to have a bodily origin in “prurigo ani” (itching of the anus),\r\nand could only be regarded as springing from a _depraved imagination_\r\n(ἀνίατον νόσον ψυχῆς ἡγούμενος—deeming it an incurable disease of the\r\nsoul); it must be that a demon had dragged him along irresistibly in\r\nhis train, and drove his victim who was incapable of helping himself\r\n(ἀσθενής—“weak”) to degradation.\r\n\r\nAll men thus held in thrall by evil demons were supposed to have\r\noffended against the gods, to have roused their anger, and were avoided\r\nand shunned by their fellows. If in addition they showed any traces of\r\nmental aberration, madness, epileptic convulsions, or the like, rude\r\npeoples saw in _these_ the manifestation of a god’s influence, and took\r\nthe victim’s sayings and dreams for oracles. So _Herodotus_ relates\r\n(IV. 67.) that the Scythians considered the ἐναρέες to have received\r\nthe gift of prophecy from Aphrodité,—οἱ δὲ ἐναρέες οἱ ἀνδρόγυνοι,\r\nτὴν Ἀφροδίτην σφισι λέγουσι μαντικὴν δοῦναι (now the ἐναρέες, the\r\nmen-women, declare that Venus brought madness on the object of her\r\nanger), and held the vice of the pathic to be due to the goddess’s\r\nwrath, or at a later time to be an (incurable) disease of the soul\r\n(ψυχή),—as is proved again by the passage of _Caelius Aurelianus_\r\nalready quoted; but they did _not_ ascribe to such men the power of\r\nprophecy, though in a certain sense every actual madman was supposed to\r\npossess it[349]. For the vice of the pathic was not in the eyes of the\r\nGreeks actual madness, but rather a vice (νόσος—disease) that robbed\r\nthe sufferer of the power of governing himself[350], in the same sense\r\nas they called sexual love a madness. From this point of view therefore\r\nthe commentators who saw in the νοῦσος θήλεια a mental affliction, had\r\nsome grounds for their view; but should not have lost sight of the fact\r\nof its being a _vice_ at the same time.\r\n\r\nBut why did the νοῦσος (disease) receive the epithet θήλεια (feminine)?\r\nTaking the word to be used _passively_,—as obviously is done by those\r\nwho make out the νοῦσος θήλεια to have been an affection similar in\r\ncharacter to menstruation,—we might find its explanation in the dictum\r\nof Tiresias, who, as is well known, ascribed to the woman the greater\r\npleasure in the act of coition. From this fact,—if it is a fact,—a\r\ngreater longing on the part of the woman for coition may be deduced;\r\nfor which reason _Plato_ compared the _uterus_ (womb) to a wild beast.\r\nThus the νοῦσος θήλεια would be _feminine concupiscence_. Just as the\r\nwoman longs intensely for natural coition with the man, in the same way\r\nand with a like intensity does the pathic long after unnatural[351].\r\nThus the punishment inflicted by Venus would have consisted in the\r\ngoddess having implanted in the man the concupiscence of a woman.\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand θήλεια (feminine) is taken in an _active_\r\nsense, as it is by _Stark_ and other interpreters,—and with greater\r\ncorrectness, then the νοῦσος θήλεια is _a form of lust that transforms\r\nmen into women_,—and this can be said of paederastia in several senses,\r\nas is manifest from what has been said already on preceding pages. The\r\nPathic becomes a woman, because he renounces his man’s prerogative, as\r\nbeing the stronger, to play the _active_ part[352], and assumes instead\r\nthe _passive_ rôle of the woman[353], Entering into competition as\r\nhe does with the ladies of pleasure in courting the favour of men, he\r\nhas recourse to all the arts they invoke to gain their object; and\r\nseeks by artificial means to bring his body into as close a resemblance\r\nas possible to the female form. He dresses himself out like a woman\r\nof pleasure, adopts female dress, and lets the hair of the head grow\r\nlong, whilst at the same time he carefully eradicates by the process\r\nof _dropacismus_ (use of pitch-ointment as a depilatory) every trace\r\nof hair on other parts of the person, even sacrificing what was the\r\nchief ornament of a man in Ancient times,—his beard[354]. All this\r\nwas done by the hero of _Aristophanes’_ “Thesmophoriazusae”, and\r\nwithout a doubt an underlying irony _à propos_ of the pathics was at\r\nthe bottom of the poet’s conception. Care of the skin, such as women\r\nadopt, by means of baths, friction with pumice-stone, etc. complete\r\nthe feminine appearance[355],—hence the expressions μάλακος, μαλθακός\r\n(soft or effeminate) for the pathic, μαλακία, μαλθακία (softness,\r\neffeminacy) for the pathic’s vice; and outraged Nature avenges herself\r\nby seconding his endeavours. In consequence of the stretching of the\r\nfundament, the buttocks become broader towards the lower part, and the\r\nspace between them wider, causing the hips to take more the shape they\r\nhave in a woman, the pelvis itself seems to be enlarged, while the\r\nlegs lose their straightness and the knees bend more and more inwards\r\n(γονύκροτος—knock-kneed,)—in short the whole of the lower half of the\r\nbody assumes the _feminine_ type.\r\n\r\nDeterioration of body is followed by deterioration of mind, and the\r\ncharacter also grows womanish.[356] The pathic despises intercourse\r\nwith women, and will not enter into marriage, so long as he continues\r\nto find his lust satisfied. When this ceases to be the case as years\r\nadvance, Nature herself forbids his propagating his race; the genital\r\norgans that have withered through disuse and refuse their office.[357]\r\nDriven from the society of men, he takes refuge, neither woman nor man\r\nhimself, with the women, who in contempt use him as a slave, and like\r\nOmphalé of old with Hercules, put the distaff into his hands! Thus from\r\nthe νοῦσος θήλεια, the vice, an actual disease has sprung; and we can\r\nnow see that _Longinus_[358] was surely right in calling the expression\r\nof _Herodotus_ ἀμίμητος,—an _inimitable_ one, for certainly in no more\r\nconcise or better way can the facts and the consequences of the vice of\r\nthe Pathic be characterized.\r\n\r\nHowever if any one should consider all this still insufficient to\r\nprove the case, and regard the indication given by _Longinus_ as not\r\nexplicit enough, he may learn from _Tiberius the Rhetorician_[359]\r\nthat as a matter of fact the Ancients understood the νοῦσος θήλεια in\r\nHerodotus in this and in no other sense. He says:\r\n\r\n“Now a paraphrase is when authors alter a simple, straightforward\r\nstatement of fact that is complete, for the sake of style or effect\r\nor sublimity of phrase, and express the matter in other words, and\r\nthese more forcible and suitable; as e.g. in _Herodotus_, when he\r\nwrote ἐνέσκηψεν ἡ θεὸς θήλειαν νόσον (the goddess afflicted them with\r\n_feminine disease_) instead of “made them men-women or cinaedi”. The\r\nword ἀνδρόγυνος (man-woman) is used here in the same way as in another\r\npassage where _Herodotus_ says[360], οἱ δὲ ἐνάρεες, οἱ ἀνδρόγυνοι\r\n(and the ἐνάρεες, the men-women). The false interpretation of this\r\nword has more than anything else led to misunderstanding as to the\r\nνοῦσος θήλεια, for it was supposed that by ἀνδρόγυνοι (men-women)\r\nactual eunuchs were intended, whereas pathics are meant and nothing\r\nmore. How the case really stood might have been seen from _Suidas_,\r\nwho tells us: _ἀνδρόγυνος_· ὁ Διόνυσος, _ὡς καὶ τὰ ἀνδρῶν ποιῶν καὶ\r\nτὰ γυναικῶν πάσχων_· ἢ ἄνανδρος καὶ Ἑρμαφρόδιτος· καὶ ἀνδρογύνων,\r\nἀσθενῶν. γυναικῶν καρδίας ἐχόντων. (_man-woman_: Dionysus, _as both\r\nperforming a man’s part and suffering a woman’s_. Synonyms, “unmanly”,\r\nand “Hermaphrodite”. Also of men-women, weakly men, having the hearts\r\nof women.) Dionysus[361] then _performed the act of coition as a man,\r\nand suffered himself to be used as a woman_, and for this reason was\r\ncalled ἀνδρόγυνος (man-woman). We find the word used in the same way\r\nin _Plato_[362], in the passage of _Dio Chrysostom_ quoted a little\r\nabove, in various places in the _Writers on Physiognomy_, in _Philo_,\r\nloco citato, and in Artemidorus[363]. From the last we quote a passage\r\nhighly interesting for our purpose:\r\n\r\n“A man saw in a dream his penis covered with hair to the extreme tip,\r\nshaggy with very thick hair that grew all of a sudden on it. He was a\r\nnotorious cinaedus, indulging in every abominable pleasure, effeminate\r\nand a man-woman; only never using his member as a _man_ does. In this\r\nway it happened that that part was so little employed, that through\r\nnot being rubbed against another body hair actually grew on it.” The\r\nsame author relates in another place[364]: “A man saw in a dream the\r\nrôle[365] of a man-woman played on the stage; _his privy member fell\r\nsick_. A man thought he saw a priest of Cybelé (a castrated man); _his\r\nprivy member fell sick_. This happened in the first instance because of\r\nthe name, in the second because of the coincidence of the fact with the\r\nspectator’s condition. And indeed you know what κωμῳδεῖν (to represent\r\nin comedy) signifies in dreams, and what it means to see a priest\r\nof Cybelé. You remember too that if any one dreams he sees a Comedy\r\nor Tragedy and remembers it afterwards, the event can be predicted\r\naccording to the plot of the piece dreamed of.”\r\n\r\nThe passage affords us yet another proof as to the causes that were\r\nsupposed in Antiquity to condition the rise of diseases of the\r\ngenitals, and we need certainly feel no surprise if we find the\r\nætiological relations of these complaints even in professional writers\r\nwrapped in all but impenetrable obscurity.\r\n\r\nNow what _is_ the word ἐναρέες? Some scholars take it to be Greek;\r\nand accordingly would read ἐναγέες (persons who have sinned against\r\nthe godhead), as _Bouhier_ did, and perhaps _Caelius Rhodoginus_\r\neven in his time, or else ανάριες (_imbelles, ad luctum_ veneream\r\ninepti,—unwarlike, i.e. unfit for the struggle of love), which was\r\n_Coray’s_ emendation. _Stark_ does not believe in any corruption of\r\nthe word, but thinks it should be derived from ἐναίρω (_spolio_,—I\r\nrob, spoil), ἔναρα (_spolia_,—spoils), making it signify _virilitate\r\nspoliati_,—men robbed of their virility. But ἐναίρω according to\r\n_Buttmann’s_ Lexilogus, p. 276., means “to send down to Hades”, to\r\nslay, ἔναρα the spoils taken from the _slain_, and from this comes the\r\nidea of spoliation, deprivation. The word undoubtedly occurs (Homer,\r\nIliad XXIV. 244.) in the sense of “to be slain”, but the meaning\r\n_virilitate spoliari_ (to be deprived of virility) without the addition\r\nof some supplemental word can certainly not be authenticated in old\r\nWriters. Supposing this derivation to be correct, ἐναρέες might signify\r\nsimply (Temple) robbers, and as a matter of fact the glosses give\r\nὁπλίται (warriors) as an explanation. It is a surprising thing that\r\nthose who make out the νοῦσος θήλεια to have been gonorrhœa (clap),\r\nshould not have derived the word from ἐάρ, the sap, the seed, with\r\ninserted ν.\r\n\r\nHowever a Greek origin of the word is rendered unlikely by one simple\r\ncircumstance. _Herodotus_ writes τοὺς καλέουσι Ἐναρέας οἱ Σκύθαι,\r\n(whom the Scythians call Ἐναρέες,—which is obviously the same thing as\r\nsaying, “in the language of the Scythians they are called Ἐναρέες”.\r\nAnd again why should _Herodotus_ have explained it by ἀνδρόγυνοι\r\n(men-women), if it was a word that every Greek could understand. In\r\nthis view moreover _Wesseling_ and _Schweighäuser_, scholars possessing\r\na special, critical knowledge of their Herodotus, concur. We do not\r\nindeed know to what family of speech the Scythian belongs; but it\r\nmay be assumed that the word signifying the disease took its origin\r\nfrom the same country where the νοῦσος θήλεια itself arose. We\r\nbelieve ἐναρέες[366] to have been originally a Syrian word, which the\r\nScythians, or more likely the Greeks[367], first adopted into their\r\nown idiom. The Greeks were particularly good at the transformation or,\r\nif you please, distortion, of foreign names! The word which we think\r\nmust be claimed as the original is the Semitic נַעֲרָה (_naãrâ_),—the\r\n_girl_, the _woman_ in the abstract; and we conjecture _Herodotus_\r\nwrote ναρέες, a form which is actually found according to _Coray_ in\r\none Manuscript. The meaning then would be the _womanish_ man, and this\r\ngives a complete correspondance with νοῦσος θήλεια and ἀνδρόγυνος.\r\nAnother conjecture is based on the name of the Babylonish Praefect or\r\nἌνναρος, to which _Coray_ calls attention, adding: _mais qui pourroit\r\nbien être un surnom altéré par les copistes, et relatif à sa vie\r\neffeminée et au milieu des femmes_. (but which might very possibly be\r\na surname changed by the transcribers and referring to his effeminate\r\nlife and his living surrounded by women.) In _Athenaeus_[368] we read\r\nin fact: Κτησίας δ’ ἱστορεῖ, _Ἀνναρον_ τὸν βασιλέως ὕπαρχον καὶ τῆς\r\nΒαβυλωνίας δυναστεύσαντα στολῇ χρῆσθαι γυναικείᾳ καὶ κόσμῳ· καὶ ὅτι\r\nβασιλέως δούλῳ ὄντι κ. τ. λ. (Ctesias relates in his History that\r\nAnnarus, the King’s Praefect and Governor of Babylon wore a woman’s\r\nrobes and ornaments; and that being a slave of the King, etc.) Still as\r\na matter of fact it is difficult to see _why_ the transcriber should\r\nhave introduced the name as Ἄνναρος, the whole form of the sentence\r\ndemanding a proper name. _Coray_ refuses to admit that ἐναρέες is a\r\nforeign word at all, for he says, “cette manière de s’exprimer n’est\r\nsouvent qu’une version littérale du mot étranger dans la langue de\r\nl’écrivain qui l’emploie”. (such a mode of expression is very often\r\nnothing more than a literal translation of the foreign word into the\r\nlanguage of the writer using it). But if this were the case, and the\r\nword one that a Greek would have understood, why did _Herodotus_ go out\r\nof his way to explain it by ἀνδρόγυνοι? Supposing a transcriber to have\r\ninserted Ἄνναρον into the text, yet even then the word must have been\r\nfamiliar to him in the sense of _womanish, unmanly_. But if it _has_\r\nthis meaning, Coray’s conjecture,—to read ἀναρέες for ἐναρέες, should\r\nbe unhesitatingly adopted,—if that is (a point to which Prof. _Pott_\r\nhas drawn attention) the derivation is taken from Sanskrit or Zend.\r\n\r\nIn Zend in fact man is _nara_, woman _narî_; in Sanskrit _nrî_ is\r\nthe stem, nom. _nâ_, pl. _nar-as_,—or else _nara_ the stem and nom.\r\n_naras_, from which has come the Greek ἀνήρ (man) by addition of\r\nthe prosthetic, (not privative), α. Now from _nara_, by prefixing\r\nα privative, which exists both in Zend and Sanskrit, may be formed\r\n_a-nara_, with the meaning of _not-man, unmanly_,—a meaning which is\r\npreserved in the name Ἄναρος (the doubling of the ν is undoubtedly\r\nwrong); and so ἀναρέες would be literally the same by etymology with\r\nHippocrates’ ἀνανδριεῖς (unmanly men), occurring in a passage to be\r\npresently discussed. This, and equally ἀνανδρία, ἀνάνδρος (unmanliness,\r\nunmanly) are all expressions for the pathic and his vice, as is shown\r\nagain and again by passages quoted in the course of our investigation.\r\n\r\nBut again, if with _Coray_ an actual verbal translation of a foreign\r\nword is supposed, then ἀνανέρες (ἀ-ν-ἀνέρες) might be read,—a word\r\nwhich though quite legitimately formed, was not in actual use by the\r\nGreeks, and for this reason _Herodotus_ naturally enough explained it\r\nby ἀνδρόγυνοι. In any case the remarkable fact remains that no one of\r\nthe ancient Lexicographers, _Suidas_ for instance or _Hesychius_[369],\r\nshould have thought the word, in whatever form it may have been read,\r\nworthy of notice in his Dictionary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 18.\r\n\r\nWe have now, we think, adequately discussed the νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine\r\ndisease) in the preceding Sections, and proved that the oldest view\r\nof all, viz. that _the vice of the Pathic_ must be understood by that\r\nterm, may be justified from every point of view. It only remains\r\nto subject to examination passages from such other authors as have\r\nemployed the expression. These _Stark_, §§ 11-18., has most carefully\r\ncollected. In this way we shall see how far they may be brought into\r\nharmony with the view adopted.\r\n\r\n_Philo_[370] relates among a number of other evidences of the\r\noutspokenness of Diogenes the Philosopher, when he was a captive and\r\nexposed for sale as a slave, how his fellow-prisoners all stood sad\r\nand cast down, but _he_ again and again gave free course to his witty\r\nhumour. “For instance when he cast his eye on one of the buyers, who\r\nsuffered from the _feminine disease_, he would seem to have gone up to\r\nthe man, whose outward appearance announced him to be an _unmanly_ man,\r\nand said: ‘Do you buy me, for you seem to be in want of a man!’ The\r\nbuyer, conscious and ashamed, slunk away among the crowd, whilst the\r\nbystanders marvelled at Diogenes’ wit and boldness.”\r\n\r\nIn another place[371] _Philo_ says, after having spoken of the Laws\r\nof Moses against harlotry: “Yet another evil much more serious than\r\nthe one mentioned, has crept into states, _paederastia_ to wit, the\r\nbare naming of which was _formerly_ an outrage. But now it is a matter\r\nof boast, not only with those who _practise_ it, but also with the\r\n_pathics, the men of whom it is customary to say,—They suffer from\r\nfeminine disease_. In fact they are effeminated in body and soul, and\r\nnot one spark of manliness do they suffer to appear in them. They braid\r\nand deck their hair to look like women, they smear and paint their\r\nfaces with ceruse and cosmetics and such like things, anoint their\r\npersons with fragrant ointments,—for a fragrant smell is an attraction\r\nmuch sought after by such. Expending every possible care on their\r\noutward adornment, they are not ashamed even to employ every device _to\r\nchange artificially their nature as men into that of women_. Against\r\nsuch it is right to be bloodthirsty, obeying the Law, which commands:\r\nto slay,—and fear no penalty,—the _man-woman_ who transgresses the\r\nlaw of nature, to let him live not a day, not an hour,—shaming as he\r\ndoes himself, his family, his country, nay! the whole race of mankind.\r\nThe _paederast_ must endure the same penalty, for he pursues after a\r\npleasure that is contrary to Nature, and, so far as in him lies, makes\r\nStates desert and empty of inhabitants, annihilating the begetting of\r\nchildren. More than this he endeavours to entice others and lead them\r\naway into two most abominable vices, _unmanliness_ and _effeminacy_,\r\nbedizening youths (like women), and womanizing men in the vigour of\r\ntheir age, just at the time when they ought rather to be roused to aim\r\nat strength and hardihood. In a word, like a bad farmer, he lets the\r\nrich and fertile ploughland lie untilled, and makes it unfruitful,\r\nbut labours day and night where he can expect no harvest whatever.\r\nNow this comes, I think, from the fact that in most States prizes\r\nare really offered for _incontinence_ and _effeminacy_,—the vices\r\nof the paederast and the pathic. At any rate these men-women may be\r\nseen constantly strutting in the _agora_ at the hour of high market,\r\nwalking in procession at the sacred festivals, sharing, unholy as they\r\nare, in holy offices, participating in mysteries and sacrifices, even\r\nengaging in the rites of Demeter. Some of them have brought the charm\r\nof their youth to such a pass that _craving a complete transformation\r\ninto women, they have amputated their generative members_; and now\r\nclad in purple robes, as if they had wrought some great benefit to\r\ntheir country, and surrounded by a body guard, they enter in state,\r\nall eyes fixed on them. Now if only such indignation as our Lawgiver\r\nhas expressed, were generally entertained against those guilty of such\r\neffrontery, and if they were banished, as expiating the common guilt of\r\ntheir country, without appeal, this would do much to improve many of\r\ntheir companions. The punishment of such as had been condemned, if in\r\nno possible way to be shirked, would contribute no little to checking\r\nany imitation of these lusts on the part of others.”\r\n\r\nIn the third passage, _Philo_[372] is speaking of the difference\r\nbetween the _symposia_ (banquets) of his time and those of the Greeks,\r\nand says:—“The Platonic banquet has to do almost entirely with Love,\r\nbut not the love of men for women, or of women for men,—for these are\r\npassions that are satisfied conformably with the law of Nature,—but\r\nthe love of men whose affections are directed to youths. For all the\r\nnoble things that are said besides about Eros (Love) and the heavenly\r\nAphrodité are to be taken as mere fine talk. By far the most part\r\nin fact concerns Ἔρως κοινὸς and Ἔρως πάνδημος (Common Love, Public\r\nLove), which destroys all manliness, the virtue that is most needful\r\nin war and peace, _infecting the mind with the “feminine disease”,\r\nand turning men into men-women_, whereas they should be equipped with\r\neverything conducive to manly vigour. Instead of this it ruins young\r\nmen’s manliness, and gives them the nature and character of a wanton;\r\nalso inflicting injury on the Lover in the most important factors of\r\nlife,—body, soul and property. For the thoughts of the paederast must\r\nneeds be all centred on the boy he loves, and his gaze quick to see\r\nthat object only: while for all other concerns, private or public, his\r\neyes are blinded and useless, and this especially if he is unhappy in\r\nhis love. His worldly condition takes hurt in two ways, partly through\r\nneglect, partly through expenditure on the loved one. Associated with\r\nthis is yet another, and a greater because general, mischief. Such men\r\nbring about the depopulation of Cities, and cause a lack of a good,\r\nsound strain of men, producing barrenness and unfruitfulness. They\r\nresemble those that are unskilful in husbandry, etc.”\r\n\r\nIn a fourth passage again, one overlooked however by _Stark_,\r\n_Philo_[373] says, speaking of the inhabitants of Sodom and their\r\nunbridled dissoluteness and vice:—\r\n\r\n“For not only being mad after women did they form disgraceful\r\nunions with strange women, but actually, men as they were, they had\r\nintercourse with males: they that practised the vice had no shame\r\nfor the sex they shared in common with those that suffered it, but\r\nwere guilty of wasting their seed and disdaining the generation of\r\noffspring. But conviction of guilt was of no avail to restrain men\r\nmastered by an overpowering lust. Later, learning by degrees the custom\r\nfor such as were born men yet to endure the treatment proper to women,\r\n_they brought upon themselves feminine disease, a curse they could in\r\nno wise contend against_. For not merely womanizing their bodies by\r\neffeminacy and wanton luxury, but utterly unsexing their very souls,\r\nthey destroyed, so far as in them lay, all the manliness of their sex.\r\nIn fact, if Greeks and Barbarians had been unanimous and had all been\r\neager at once after such intercourse, the consequence would have been\r\nto make every city desolate, as though wasted by some pestilential\r\nsickness.”\r\n\r\nIn the fifth and last passage of all _Philo_[374] is speaking of those\r\nwhose entry into the sanctuary was interdicted by the Lawgiver: “He\r\nforbad all that were unworthy to frequent, the Temple, beginning _with\r\nthe men-women, those that are sick of the true (the feminine) disease_,\r\nwho transgressing the established law of Nature, _annex the lust and\r\nlooks of incontinent women_. He expelled all eunuchs, those with\r\nstrangled testicles and those with amputated, who carefully safeguard\r\nthe bloom of youthfulness against decay, and transform the manly type\r\ninto a womanish shape. He expelled not only harlots, but harlots’\r\nchildren as well, etc.”\r\n\r\nIf we review systematically and in detail these passages of _Philo_,\r\ngiven by _Stark_ only in fragments, any unprejudiced reader must see\r\nthat there is not one of them that does not refer to the vice of the\r\nPathic. As to the second and third passages _Stark_ himself (pp. 13\r\nand 22.) admits this, while as to the fourth we do not know what he\r\nthought, it having been unknown to him: thus it is only in relation to\r\nthe _first_ and _fifth_ passages that we have to examine his reasons\r\nfor supposing this not to be the case. After quoting the text and\r\n_Mangey’s_ Latin translation, _Stark_ remarks à propos of the _first_\r\npassage,—that dealing with Diogenes:—“Quin hic verum corporis, nec\r\nanimi vitium seu morbum indicetur, quo laborantes virilitate orbarentur\r\net hanc suam impotentiam corporis habitu atque oris specie proderent,\r\nnullus dubito. Nam hoc et verborum series aperte declarat et ex eo\r\ncolligi potest, quod ille, qui hoc crimine tactum se sentiret, pudore\r\nmovetur.... Si vero Pathicorum labes, quam ab interpretibus quibusdam\r\nhic suspicari video, ita intelligenda esset, haec _neque ex vultu\r\nconiici_ poterat _neque a Graecis tam turpi macula notabatur_, ut huic\r\nvitio deditis causa esset, quam ab rem eius opprobrium effugerent.\r\nTantum enim abfuit, ut Pathici dedecus suum occultarent, ut potius\r\nmulto fastu atque pompa prae se ferrent.... Verum autem Eunuchum\r\ngenitalium exsectione redditum his verbis significari, non crediderim,\r\nquia hi neque inter licitatores, sed potius inter vendendos reperiri,\r\nneque ob harum partium defectum pudore tangi solerent.” (I have no\r\ndoubt whatever that a real fault of body, and not of mind, in other\r\nwords a disease, is intended here,—a disease that robbed the sufferers\r\nof virility, who then betrayed this impotence by the condition and\r\nappearance of body and countenance. This indeed is fully shown by the\r\ncontext, from which it may also be gathered that the sufferer who felt\r\nhimself touched by this vice, has a feeling of shame.... But if it is\r\nthe taint of the pathics that is to be understood here, as I see is\r\nconjectured to be the case by some commentators, this taint could not\r\nbe guessed at from the face; nor yet was it marked by the Greeks with\r\nso strong a stigma of disgrace, as to cause those who were given to\r\nit to strive to escape the opprobrium. For so far were pathics from\r\nwishing to conceal their shame, that they actually made a point of\r\ndisplaying it ostentatiously.... On the other hand I should not be\r\ninclined to suppose that a Eunuch, an actual Eunuch by amputation of\r\nthe genitals, is meant by these words. These were hardly likely to\r\nbe found among the bidders, but rather with the slaves for sale: nor\r\nwere eunuchs accustomed to feel shame on account of the loss of these\r\norgans.)\r\n\r\nIn § 16 above it has been abundantly proved that the recognition of\r\na pathic ἐκ τῆς ὄψεως, _ex voltu_, (by the look), was a simple and\r\nfamiliar thing with the Ancients, and especially so if we understand,\r\nas is only reasonable, by ἐκ τῆς ὄψεως not merely by the _face_, but\r\nby the whole appearance of the person as well. We can only wonder at\r\n_Stark’s_ repeated denials of the existence of such external marks\r\nof recognition, and all the more so, as every Text-book of Medical\r\nJurisprudence making any pretensions to complete detail (e.g. _Masius_,\r\n_Mende_) gives information on the point. Again, it is proved that\r\npaederastia was always regarded by the Greeks, till the time when\r\nthey lost their independence, as a disgraceful vice,—the reason why\r\nthe buyer spoken of slunk away with a blush. As for the ostentatious\r\nshow of pathics, and particularly their importance and the power they\r\nacquired, to which _Stark_ refers (p. 12. in his Note—28), this is only\r\ntrue for times as late as _Philo’s_ own, (he lived 40 A.D.), whereas\r\n_Diogenes_ appears in History in the middle of the 4th. Century B.C.\r\n_Stark_, again, cites as evidence the words from the second passage:\r\n_Puerorum amor, de quo vel loqui olim probrum fuit maximum, nunc laudi\r\nducitur_, (The love of boys, merely to speak of which was formerly\r\na deep disgrace, but which now is made a boast),—without observing\r\nthat his contention as to paederastia not being held disgraceful in\r\nAntiquity is most obviously contradicted by it. Undoubtedly actual\r\ncastrated eunuchs were not meant, but the reasons _Stark_ brings\r\nforward to show this are without force, for he will hardly be able\r\nto prove that in Asia the Castrated never acquired importance and\r\nwealth, so as to be in a position to buy themselves slaves. Further\r\nit may be gathered that the man Diogenes addressed was rich or held\r\nan important station from the fact that the bystanders marvelled at\r\nDiogenes’ boldness and outspokenness, a point that _Stark_ indeed has\r\nforgotten to mention. For _Philo’s_ own times the second passage is\r\nevidence enough. Equally do we fail to see why a castrated eunuch would\r\nbe unlikely to blush, when the fact is thrown in his face. _Stark_ (p.\r\n22) explains the νοῦσος θήλεια as _vitium corporis_ or _effeminatio\r\ninterno morboso corporis statu procreata_, (a fault of body, condition\r\nof effeminacy produced by an internal morbid state of body). Now if\r\nit were really this, how could he possibly speak of the sufferers as\r\n_crimine tactos_, (touched by his _vice_)? They had nothing to be\r\nashamed of, unless indeed they had acquired the disease in a shameful\r\nway, but this was not the case according to his original assumption.\r\nThis is confirmed by _Clement of Alexandria_.[375]\r\n\r\nSo far as the _fifth_ passage is concerned, Stark declares castrated\r\neunuchs to be certainly intended, and blames the editor of _Philo_\r\n(_Mangey_) for wishing to read for ἀπὸ τῶν νοσούντων τὴν _ἀληθῆ_ νόσον\r\nἀνδρογύνων (with the men-women, those that are sick of the _true_\r\ndisease) τὴν _θήλειαν_ νόσον (the _feminine_ disease). He says in his\r\nnote 30.: “_Mangetius_ (a mistake for _Mangey_) reponit θήλειαν. Quare\r\nhoc fieri, non dicam debeat, sed ne oporteat quidem, non video. Nam\r\nνόσος ἀνδρογύνων idem est, quod νόσος θήλεια. Si igitur haec vox verbis\r\nsuperioribus adiiciatur, iners atque inutilis appareat et pleonasmum\r\nvanum efficiat, necesse est: τὸ ἀληθῆ contra, quod ille demit, non\r\nvacuum ceteris additur verbum, ut eo perspicue demonstraretur, hic\r\n_verum morbum_ seu _illud corporis vitium_ esse intelligendum, quod\r\nviros exsecando paritur, nec hanc animi labem, qua contaminati solum\r\nmuliebria patiuntur, quaequae iisdem verbis nuncupatur, ut loci mox\r\nlaudandi docebunt.” (Mangetius restores θήλειαν—feminine. I cannot see\r\nwhy he should do this; in fact he had no business to do so whatever.\r\nFor νόσος ἀνδρογύνων (disease of men-women) is the same thing as νόσος\r\nθήλεια (feminine disease). So if this expression is added on to the\r\npreceding words, it can only appear redundant and useless and make a\r\nsilly pleonasm. Τὸ ἀληθῆ (the word _true_ disease) on the other hand\r\nis not otiose when added to the other words. It shows distinctly that\r\nthe _true disease or notorious vitiation of body_ was meant to be\r\nunderstood, that which arises from castrating men, and not merely the\r\ntaint of mind that makes the men whom it affects endure the treatment\r\nproper to women, and which is called by the same name,—as will be shown\r\nin passages to be cited presently.)\r\n\r\nThese last words evidently refer to the third passage, where we read:\r\nΘήλειαν δὲ νόσον ταῖς ψυχαῖς ἀπεργαζόμενος καὶ ἀνδρογύνους κατασκευάζων\r\n(infecting the mind with feminine disease, and turning men into\r\nmen-women), for _Stark_ himself explains the νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine\r\ndisease) as being identical with the ἀνδρογύνων νόσος (disease\r\nof men-women). So he is bound to explain this sentence too as a\r\n_Pleonasmus vanus_ (silly, useless, pleonasm), for as a matter of fact\r\nthose suffering from νοῦσος θήλεια _are_ men-women (ἀνδρόγυνοι). But if\r\na pleonasm is found in these latter words, it is difficult to see why\r\nthere should not be one equally well in the fifth passage.\r\n\r\nYet for all he says, it is far from being demonstrated that this\r\npleonasm _is_ useless and silly. The sequence of thought is evidently\r\nthis: Common Eros (Love) infects the soul (ψυχή) with the νοῦσος\r\nθήλεια, rousing the insatiable craving to play the part of the woman,\r\nto be pathic in fact; and then, this craving being indulged, the man\r\nbecomes a man-woman (ἀνδρόγυνος). As long as he goes on practising\r\nthe vice of the pathic, he is sick of the νοῦσος θήλεια, and so it is\r\nperfectly correct to speak of the νοῦσος θήλεια ἀνδρογύνων (feminine\r\ndisease of men-women). A man-woman, that is a person who suffers\r\ncoition to be consummated with him as with a woman, and concurrently\r\nalso consummates coition with women as a man, or at any rate has the\r\nability to do so,—this anyone may quite well be, without suffering for\r\nall that from the νοῦσος θήλεια. For instance he may be constrained\r\nby force to be a pathic, or may regard it as a way of earning money,\r\nlike the male prostitutes of Greece and Rome; and in that case has no\r\ninterest further in the vice of the pathic as such. On the other hand\r\nif he is urged to it by _prurigo ani impudica_ (lascivious itch of\r\nthe anus), this is sheer lubricity, not to be expected in a sensible,\r\nhealthy-minded man. It can only be the consequence of a morbid\r\ncondition of temperament and body. Such a man is the victim of νοῦσος\r\nθήλεια, the craving to be a woman! This is just the position taken in\r\nthe fifth passage, as the subsequent words show quite plainly.\r\n\r\nBut granted that _Philo_ actually wrote in this fifth passage τὴν\r\nἀληθῆ νόσον ἀνδρογύνων (the true disease of men-women), would a\r\nbodily defect, castration, be signified by the expression? Certainly\r\nnot. We could then take it in no other way but this, “he began with\r\nthe men-women, who suffered from the true disease,” and should be\r\nconstrained to ask, “_what_ disease?”,—a definite disease being\r\nmanifestly intended, as the addition of the definite article (τὴν)\r\nshows. But this would imply that men-women who were not suffering from\r\nthis particular disease were _not_ excluded from visiting the Temple.\r\nYet most certainly _Philo_ would never make any such statement. However\r\n_Stark_ translates with _Mangey_: _Exorsus a vero semivirorum morbo\r\nlaborantibus_ that is, “he began with those suffering from the true\r\ndisease of men-women”, from which it would follow that there were other\r\npersons who suffered from the _apparent_ disease of the men-women, or\r\nno reason exists for the special emphasis the definite article gives.\r\n\r\nReally the question all along is not of castrated persons at all, and\r\ncannot be, if the sense of the whole passage is taken into account;\r\nfor these (castrated persons) are specially and separately forbidden\r\naccess to the Temple in the next sentence,—a fact which nothing but the\r\nintroduction into the text of the conjunction γὰρ (for) by _Mangey_,\r\n(following a MS. it is true), has obscured. The words as they stand are\r\nΘλαδιὰς [γὰρ] καὶ ἀποκεκομμένους τὰ γεννητικὰ ἐλαύνει, (he expells all\r\neunuchs, those with strangled testicles, and those with amputated).\r\nSo if the men-women who suffered from the νοῦσος θήλεια were actual\r\neunuchs, this would indeed be a _Pleonasmus vanus et ineptus_ (silly\r\nand idle pleonasm). _Stark_ has evidently been led to maintain the\r\nopinion he does, and to blame Mangey’s emendation, which is in any\r\ncase justified, by a mistake as to the construction of the sentence.\r\n_Stark_ construed νοῦσον ἀνδρογύνων (disease of men-women), whereas\r\nthe construction requires: τὴν ἄρχην ποιούμενος ἀπὸ ἀνδρογύνων, τῶν\r\nνοσούντων τὴν θήλειαν (ἀληθῆ) νόσον (beginning with men-women,—those\r\nthat were sick of the feminine—true—disease), the latter words being\r\nsimply in apposition to ἀνδρογύνων.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 19.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to consider the passages from the historian _Herodian_\r\n(170-240 A.D.). He relates[376]:\r\n\r\n“Now he (Antoninus) had two generals, of whom the one, an oldish man\r\nbut stupid and quite unacquainted with state affairs, was yet held to\r\nbe a good soldier; his name was _Adventus_. The other who was called\r\n_Macrinus_, was not inexperienced in forensic practice and possessed\r\nbesides some knowledge of law. Now the latter _Antoninus_ frequently\r\nassailed in public with gibes, saying he was neither a soldier nor a\r\nman, going so for as positive _insult_. For having heard that he led a\r\nsomewhat free life, and abominated scanty, rough eating and drinking\r\n(in which _Antoninus_ as a hardy soldier took a pride), and wore a\r\nwoman’s cloak or other elegant raiment, he accused him of ἀνανδρία\r\nand θήλεια νοῦσος (_unmanliness_ and _feminine disease_), and was\r\nconstantly threatening to put him to death. _Macrinus_ could not endure\r\nsuch treatment and was very much exasperated. And this was the result\r\n... etc.” Here ἀνανδρία and θήλεια νοῦσος (unmanliness and _feminine\r\ndisease_) are laid to _Macrinus’_ charge by _Antoninus_ by way of\r\ninsult, but it is not in any way stated that he had become actually\r\nimpotent or Pathic. True ἀνανδρία (_unmanliness_) is frequently used\r\nof the Pathic, but here it refers simply to a womanish way of life in\r\nconnexion with eating and drinking, whilst the θήλεια νοῦσος (_feminine\r\ndisease_) is inferred from the female costume, a thing in which, as we\r\nhave seen, the Pathics delighted[377].\r\n\r\n_Stark_ indeed gives the following note on the passage: “Ego\r\nquidem impotentiam virilem et illam morbosam in sexum sequiorem\r\ndegenerationem, quae per animi mollitiem aeque ac per corporis\r\nmutationem se prodit, hic accipiendam esse credo, nec video, cur\r\ninterpres labem illam qua muliebris tolerantiae viri maculantur,\r\nintellectam velit.” (In fact I consider we must take to be here meant\r\nimpotence and that morbid degeneration towards the inferior sex which\r\nbetrays itself at once by effeminacy of mind and bodily deterioration;\r\nat the same time I see no reason for a commentator thinking that\r\nspecific pollution to be signified whereby men are affected who suffer\r\nthemselves to be treated as women.) However if only _Stark_ had chanced\r\nto read through the succeeding 13th. chapter of _Herodian_ as well, he\r\nwould have found _Antoninus_ only meant to put upon the man an ordinary\r\ncoarse jest; for he there makes the very same reproach against the\r\nCenturion _Martialis_, whose brother he had had executed a few days\r\npreviously; αὐτῷ τε τῷ Μαρτιαλίῳ ἐνύβρισεν, _ἄνανδρον αὐτὸν καὶ ἀγεννῆ\r\nκαλῶν_ καὶ _Μακαρίνου φίλον_, (And he insulted Martialis himself,\r\n_calling him unmanly and ignoble and a friend of Macarinus_.) In any\r\ncase the passage shows that even at that period Paederastia was held to\r\nbe dishonourable and the name of Pathic involved an insult.\r\n\r\nThe Church Historian _Eusebius Pamphili_ (264-340 A.D.) relates in his\r\nLife of _Constantine_[378] that on a part of the peak of Mount Lebanon\r\nstood a Temple of Venus: “Therein was a school of vice for licentious\r\npersons of every description, for all such as dishonoured their bodies\r\nin various ways; womanish men, that are no men at all, abrogated their\r\nnatural dignity and propitiated the goddess by θήλεια νοῦσος (feminine\r\ndisease); and again unlawful unions of women, lecherous embraces,\r\nabominable and abominated acts, were indulged in in this Temple, as\r\nin a spot where neither law nor religion held good. And there was no\r\none to overlook their doings, for no respectable man dared go near the\r\nplace.” Now to any one examining the whole drift of the passage, it\r\ncannot for a single moment remain doubtful that by θήλεια νοῦσος is\r\nhere meant some particular form of vice; and the words of the text are\r\nsuch that, even if the expression only occurred here and nowhere else\r\nat all, absolutely no other meaning could be assigned to it but that of\r\nthe vice of the Pathic. We have already shown that the words ἀκόλαστος\r\n(licentious person), πράξις, πράττειν (action, to act) are\r\nused of the Pathic, whilst the phrase τὸ σεμνὸν τῆς φύσεως (natural\r\ndignity) finds its explanation in the τὸ φύσεως νόμισμα (custom of\r\nnature) of _Philo_, and γύννιδες (womanish men) is interpreted in\r\n_Zonaras_[379] by ἀνδρόγυνος (man-woman), μαλακός (soft, effeminate),\r\nand in Eustathius[380] by θηλυδρίας μὴ εὖ διακέιμενος πρὸς τὰ\r\nἀφροδίσια (womanish man, one not properly behaved with regard to\r\nlove),—meanings the real force of which we have elsewhere verified, but\r\nwhich most certainly are not to be taken as implying actual castration,\r\nas _Stark_ (§ 16) thinks. Indeed the last named says, commenting on\r\nthe passage of Eusebius: “Haec verba non solum de mera morum atque\r\ncultus mutatione muliebri rationi magis congrua, intelligi posse, sed\r\netiam per veram evirationem genitalium truncatione confectam aptissime\r\nexplicanda esse, cum verborum series et Eustathii, Hesychii ac Zonarae\r\natque Valesii auctoritas me suadet, tum multo magis illud monet, quod\r\nin cultu Veneris virorum exsectionem solemnem fuisse compertum habemus.\r\nSin autem contenderis, viros tales exsectos et effeminatos etiam\r\nmuliebria passos esse, ego quidem non repugno, exploratam vero rem esse\r\natque ratam, ex ipsis auctoris verbis non liquet.” (That these words\r\nmay be understood not merely of a simple change of mode of life and\r\nhabit to one more closely assimilated to the female type, but that they\r\nare most suitably to be explained as implying an actual effemination of\r\nthe individual produced by amputation of the genitals, both the context\r\nof the passage and the authority of Eustathius, Hesychius, Zonaras and\r\nValesius induces me to believe, and still more am I led to this view by\r\nthe fact we already know, viz. that the castration of men was customary\r\nin connection with the cult of Venus. But if you further maintain that\r\nsuch men so castrated and effeminated submitted to the treatment proper\r\nto women, I do not deny it; I only say that this point is not duly\r\nascertained and certified on the showing of the Author’s own words.)\r\n\r\nCertainly we have already seen from the passage of _Lucian_ and from\r\n_Philo_ that Paederastia supplied a motive for the making of Eunuchs;\r\nbut the passages quoted from _Athanasius_ and other Authors have\r\nalso taught us that the pollution of boys was carried out in honour\r\nof Venus in her temples. As for the _auctoritas Valesii_ (authority\r\nof Valesius), _Stark_ adds in his notes (49): “Eandem vim his verbis\r\ntribuit, ut ex interpretatione ejus Latina Eusebii videre est. Histor.\r\nscriptor. ecclesiast. Paris 1677. fol. p. 211. B.” (He assigns the same\r\nforce to these words, as may be seen from his Latin translation of\r\nEusebius). To our regret we are unable to refer to this edition,—which\r\nit appears to us would have been a highly desirable precaution; for\r\nthe one which lies before us,[381] a word for word, only more correct,\r\nre-impression of the Paris edition, gives the version of Valesius\r\nentirely in our sense: “Quippe effeminati quidam et feminae potius\r\ndicendi quam viri, abdicata sexus sui gravitate, _muliebria patientes_,\r\ndaemonem placabant.” (Whereas certain effeminate men, that should\r\nrather be called women than men, abrogating the dignity of their sex,\r\nand suffering treatment proper to women, used in this way to propitiate\r\ntheir deity.) The same holds good of the translation given by _Stark_:\r\n“Viri effeminati et non viriles, naturae dignitatem ultro exuentes,\r\n_morbo muliebri_ deam placabant.” (Effeminate men and unmanly, of their\r\nown will putting off their nature dignity, used to propitiate the\r\ngoddess _with feminine disease_.) Ought this to be taken as implying\r\na claim on his behalf to the translation generally as adduced by him\r\nor merely to the rendering of the word γύννιδες by _viri effeminati_?\r\nThe previous authorities, _Eustathius_, _Hesychius_ and _Zonaras_, at\r\nany rate refer only to γύννιδες, while _Stark_ himself assigns it the\r\nmeaning of the _Vice of the Pathic_ in the last words quoted.\r\n\r\nBishop _Synesius_ (378-431 A.D.) in his Speech _De Regno_[382]\r\naddressed to the Emperor Arcadius exhorts the latter to set bounds to\r\nthe insubordination in the army, and for the foreign subject peoples,\r\nthat are continually meditating treason, to attack them and really\r\nconquer them, rather than wait till their hostile temper break out in\r\nopen revolt. That the renown of the Romans stood fast, that they were\r\nvictorious, wherever they came and marched through the countries of the\r\nworld, like the gods, supervising men’s insolence and government. “But\r\nthose Scythians, Herodotus tells us so, and we see it for ourselves,\r\nare all fallen under the νόσος θήλεια (feminine disease). And it is\r\nthey of whom the subject peoples mainly consist, etc.” He goes on\r\nto say how they had submitted only in appearance, while secretly\r\nthey laughed at the folly of the Romans, who took their submission\r\nseriously, etc. Now in the first place we must remember the fact\r\nthat _Synesius_, like all Greek Orators and Fathers of later times,\r\nconsidered it his special duty to cite the Classical Greek authors as\r\nfrequently as possible, and with this object made almost any peg do to\r\nhang a quotation on. He says of the Romans that they, ὡς Ὅμηρός φησι\r\nτοὺς θεούς\r\n\r\n  Ἀνθρώπων ὕβριν τε καὶ εὐνομίαν ἐφέποντες\r\n\r\n(as Homer says of the gods, “visiting the insolence and good government\r\nof men”), and to explain this ὕβρις (insolence), he recalls the\r\nstatement of Herodotus to the effect that the Scythians suffered\r\nfrom the νοῦσος θήλεια, a statement which, he adds, still holds good\r\nof them; that the vice had prevailed amongst them from the earliest\r\ntimes, that it was quite inveterate, and that accordingly men of such\r\nabandoned character could never be trusted, trained as they were to\r\ndissemble; all this _Synesius_ is specially anxious to enforce strongly\r\nupon Arcadius! In this sequence of thought we find a sufficient\r\nexplanation of the καὶ ἡμεῖς ὁρῶμεν (and we see it for ourselves); this\r\nrefers not so much to the ocular recognition of the νοῦσος θήλεια, the\r\npossibility of which however we have demonstrated elsewhere, as to the\r\nfact that the disease was _still_ to be met with among the Scythians,\r\nin order to show which Synesius laid special stress on the phrase,\r\nand added—undoubtedly to the sacrifice of truth—the word ἅπαντας (all\r\nof them). Besides which, _Dionysius Petavius_ reminds us in his notes\r\non this passage that the name “Scythian” is used here, as it is in\r\n_Strabo_, in its widest signification, and includes Goths, Alani,\r\nVandals, Germans, Huns, in fact all the Northern peoples. This is the\r\nmore interesting as _Sextus Empiricus_[383] relates of the Germans\r\nthat they practised Paederastia, Prof. _Meier_ (loco cit. p. 131. Note\r\n20.), who cites the passage, doubted the truth of the statement, on the\r\nground that Sextus Empiricus is the only author, and even he does so\r\nonly as a matter of hearsay (ὡς φασιν—as men say), to lay this vice to\r\nthe charge of the Germans, whose purity of morals is not impugned by\r\nany other Writers. But surely he did not take into consideration that\r\nSextus Empiricus lived about 200 years after Christ, and is speaking of\r\nthe Germans of his own times, not of the old Germans such as _Tacitus_\r\nand _Caesar_ knew them. It is hardly likely the Germans of Sextus’ and\r\nSynesius’ day should have entirely escaped the universal degeneracy of\r\nall Nations; and again, with what object did German Emperors at a later\r\ndate promulgate laws against the vice of Paederastia, Sodomy, etc., if\r\nit did not exist among their people?\r\n\r\n_Clement of Alexandria_, after speaking of the objectionable character\r\nof the worship of the different gods of the Heathen, goes on to relate\r\nas follows[384]:\r\n\r\n“All blessings befall that King of the Scythians, whatever his name\r\nmay have been, who when one of his subjects copied the service of the\r\nMother of the gods usual among the people of Cyrené, beating the drum\r\nand clashing the cymbals hung at his neck, and dedicating himself\r\nas a Menagyrtes (Priest of Cybelé), shot him dead, as a man who had\r\nbeen made _no man_ (ἄνανδρος) among the Greeks, and as a teacher of\r\nthe _feminine disease_ (νόσος θήλεια) to the rest of the Scythians.”\r\n_Herodotus_[385] who tells the same story, calls the King Saulius and\r\nthe offending citizen Anarcharsis[386], but makes no mention, any more\r\nthan do _Diogenes Laertius_ and _Philo_[387], of the θήλεια νοῦσος\r\n(feminine disease). Accordingly we must evidently regard this as an\r\n_addition_ on the part of Clement of Alexandria, who judging from his\r\nown times, when the Priests of Cybelé universally practised paederastia\r\nwith each other, and in order to further lay stress on the fact that\r\nthe Scythian king had done right in killing the man who was introducing\r\na heathen, and besides an exceedingly licentious, form of worship, felt\r\nno hesitation in making the addition. And as a matter of fact, how\r\nwidely paederastia prevailed in the time of Clement of Alexandria, and\r\nhow intimately he was acquainted with it, is proved by the passages\r\nquoted on previous pages from his writings. _Stark_ prefers here also\r\nto understand a _vera eviratio_ (true effemination), i.e. that they\r\nwere actually castrated, maintaining that this was the case with the\r\npriests of Cybelé, whilst _Larcher_ considers merely the womanish cult\r\nof the _Dea Mater_ (Goddess Mother) to be indicated.\r\n\r\nThe last passage in which the expression θήλεια νοῦσος (feminine\r\ndisease) occurs, is a _scholion_ on the word γαλλιαμβικὸν (viz.\r\nμέτρον—galliambic metre) in _Hephaestion_[388]. The Scholiast says:\r\nΓαλλιαμβικὸν δὲ ἐκλήθη, ἐπεὶ λελυμένον ἐστὶ τὸ μέτρον· οἱ δὲ Γάλλοι,\r\nδιαβάλλονται ὡς _θήλειαν νόσον_ ἔχοντες, διὸ καὶ σώματα φόρον ἐτέλουν\r\nῬωμαίοις εἰς τοῦτο· οἱ τοιοῦτοι δέ ἱερεῖς εἰσὶ Δήμητρος. (Now it was\r\ncalled galliambic, because the metre is loose; and the Galli are evil\r\nspoken of as having _feminine disease_. Wherefore also they used to\r\npay their bodies as tribute to the Romans—_or_, their bodies used\r\nto pay tribute to the Romans—to this day; and such men are priests\r\nof Demeter.) _Stark_ gives (p. 21.) the following translation of\r\nthis. “Galliambicum vocabatur, quod solutum est metrum; Galli enim\r\nutpote _morbo muliebri_ laborantes inculpantur, quod Romanis corpora\r\nad hoc (tanquam) tributum persolverent,” (It was called galliambic,\r\nbecause the metre is loose; for the Galli are accused as suffering\r\nfrom _feminine disease_, inasmuch as they used to pay their bodies to\r\nthe Romans to this day as it were a tribute),—but without committing\r\nhimself to any more precise explanation of the words. The meaning\r\nof the first two sentences is plain enough: The metre is called the\r\ngalliambic, because it is loose, resolved, i. e. instead of long\r\nsyllables short are used, and so the metres changed from masculine\r\nto feminine. Now the Galli are charged with practising θήλεια νόσος\r\n(feminine disease) (as _Homer_, Odyssey I. 368., says: ὑπέρβιον ὕβριν\r\nἔχοντες—having, practising very audacious insolence). But what do\r\nthe words that follow mean: διὸ καὶ σώματα φόρον ἐτέλουν Ῥωμαίοις\r\nεἰς τοῦτο? The _tanquam_ (as it were) added in the Latin translation\r\nshows that the translator took the sentence in a figurative sense. But\r\nwhat is the subject of the sentence? is it σώματα or Γάλλοι—ἔχοντες?\r\nThe translator must necessarily have taken the latter as the subject:\r\n“wherefore they paid or offered up their bodies to the Romans as it\r\nwere for tribute”; and this could imply nothing less than that the\r\nGalli gave themselves up to the Romans as Pathics. Now does the\r\narrangement of the words admit of this? We think not; for in that case\r\nthe Scholiast must needs have put ἑαυτῶν with σώματα or at any rate the\r\narticle τὰ.\r\n\r\nTherefore if we take the sentence literally and regard σώματα as being\r\nthe subject, it reads: “wherefore also the bodies (of the Galli) were\r\nsubject to tax to the Romans to this day.” We have seen already how the\r\nword τέλος signified among the Greeks the “prostitution tax,” and how\r\nthe Septuagint translators rendered the Hebrew קְדֵשָׁה (Kêdeshah) and\r\nקָדֵשׁ (Kâdesh), by which names the Priests of Cybelé were understood,\r\nby τελεσφόρος and τελισκόμενος (subject to tax, paying tax), how the\r\nPriests of Cybelé are characterised by other writers as men who were\r\nPathics in honour of their goddess, and how as a matter of fact the\r\n_Cinaedi_ or _Exoleti_ at Rome in the time of the Emperor Severus had\r\nto pay an impost similar to the prostitution-tax. The _scholion_ then\r\nshows us that the Galli also were subjected to this impost payable to\r\nthe State. Were it a question merely of Castrated persons or indeed of\r\nanything else but actual Paederastia, the whole _scholion_ would be\r\nunintelligible; yet _Stark_ maintains that simply Eunuchs are intended,\r\nand this because of the words that are appended, to the effect that the\r\nGalli were Priests of Demeter. No doubt they may have been castrated,\r\nbut this is a side issue; the important point is, that they were\r\nPathics.\r\n\r\nFinally we have still a passage from _Dio Chrysostom_[389] to mention,\r\nin which however the hitherto almost stereotyped expression θήλεια\r\nνόσος (feminine disease) is exchanged for γυναικεία νόσος (womanly\r\ndisease). The author is here expounding how all acts are under the\r\ngovernance of a definite Genius or Spirit, and says: “for a weakling\r\nand faint-hearted Spirit of this sort leads readily to the γυναικεία\r\nνόσος (womanly disease) and other shames, to which is attached\r\npunishment and disgrace.” Then in the following sentences the life and\r\nappearance of one governed by this Spirit are more exactly described,\r\nin such a way that there can be no possibility of supposing anything\r\nelse to be intended than the vice of the Pathic, and even _Stark_ (p.\r\n12.) admits this much.\r\n\r\nOn reviewing once again what has been said, we find that the Scythians\r\nin Asia became acquainted with paederastia, when Pathics returned from\r\nforeign lands, and henceforth practised the vice at home as well. Their\r\nfellow-countrymen could only suppose an evil demon animated them. So\r\nwhen at length as a natural result of their vice they fell sick in\r\nbody and in mind, when nervous disorders and imbecility visited the\r\nunfortunates, they never for a moment ascribed this to the vice these\r\nmen practised, but rather regarded their condition as a consequence of\r\nthe avenging wrath of Venus, whose temple they had robbed, and thus\r\nbrought into connection an earlier incident and a later.\r\n\r\nWhen the Greek became acquainted with the vice, he of course shared\r\nat first the notion of the avenging action of a deity, but he directed\r\nhis attention less to the consequences of this vice, which in Greece\r\nwere generally slighter, than to the Vice itself, which robbed the\r\nman of his manly characteristics and normal activity, and drove him\r\nto take on him the rôle of the woman in exchange for that of the man.\r\nBut to be a woman was invariably among all nations a disgrace for the\r\nman, whom _Plato_ (Timaeus 42.) considered the γένος κρεῖττον (superior\r\nsex), while _Aristotle_ not merely represents the woman as owing her\r\nexistence to an ἀνάγκη (unavoidable necessity), but calls her an ἄῤῥεν\r\nπεπηρωμένον (crippled male), an ἀναπηρία φυσική (natural crippling),\r\neven a παρέκβασις τῆς φύσεως (aberration of nature)[390]. But no man of\r\nsound intellect could possibly suffer himself to be used as a woman;\r\ntherefore he must needs be sick, be afflicted with a disease that\r\nassimilated him to a woman (θήλεια—feminine). When _Herodotus_ wrote,\r\nthe Greeks to be sure knew the vice which was practised with _boys_\r\n(Paederastia) or youths, who had not yet reached man’s estate, but\r\nthese were always first corrupted by adults; they did not practise the\r\nvice of their own impulse and could not as a rule be held accountable.\r\nWhen however they saw adults, men who were already in possession of\r\nmanly prerogatives, appear as Pathics—not merely boys and youths not\r\nyet capable of the procreative act,—they could in no way explain the\r\nphenomenon to their satisfaction except by supposing them to have been\r\nattacked by a disease that changed them into women[391]. This also\r\ngives the reason why the expression νοῦσος Θήλεια (feminine disease)\r\noccurs so seldom in the Greek writers, for it was the violation of\r\nboys, not the violation of _men_, that was a familiar fact to them.\r\nFor in the fact that the beautiful form of a boy was capable of firing\r\na sensual longing to enjoy it, the Greek saw nothing at all unnatural;\r\nand he found excuses for the momentary forgetfulness of self-respect\r\non the part of the paederast, as he did in the case of the boy or\r\nyouth. But if there had been seduction, then the offence was strongly\r\nreprobrated, unless the Pathic had been a slave.\r\n\r\nNeither bodily nor psychical consequences of the vice of the Pathic\r\never attained in Greece, as has been said, any very high degree of\r\ndevelopment; and most of the characteristic marks of the _Cinaedus_\r\nwere regarded as artificial, worn half intentionally by him for show.\r\nEven in his peculiar gait, voice and look, the Greeks saw more an\r\ninvitation to the perpetration of the vice than anything else; and if\r\n_Plato_ denies to this class of persons the wish for natural coition,\r\nthis is rather a sign how completely the vice mastered them than a\r\nproof of the annihilation of their power to procreate at all.\r\n\r\nEven when positive diseases did actually occur in consequence of the\r\nvice, public opinion was far from ascribing these to the vice itself;\r\nnervous and mental affections were regarded as a punishment from the\r\ngods, or else they were treated according to their several symptoms\r\nwithout any examination into the original cause. Bodily ailments,\r\nespecially if they did not affect the posterior or penis, were set down\r\nto any cause but the true one, often to quite ridiculous ones. The\r\nνοῦσος θήλεια (feminine disease) was invariably thought of merely as a\r\nform of vice dependent on a morbid imagination, while its consequences\r\nas such were left entirely out of consideration. _Nam neque ulla\r\ncuratio corporis depellendae passionis causa recte putatur adhibenda,\r\nsed potius animus coercendus, qui tanta peccatorum labe vexatur_, (For\r\nthe right opinion is this: no bodily treatment should be applied in\r\norder to expel the complaint, rather should the mind be disciplined\r\nthat is vexed by so foul a stain of sinful indulgences), are the words\r\nof _Coelius Aurelianus_ in the passage quoted on page 159.\r\n\r\nFrom this it is evident the later enquirers quoted above could take the\r\nνοῦσος θήλεια (feminine disease) for a purely mental affection, and be\r\nright in a sense,—but a sense that certainly never entered into their\r\nheads to consider. For they looked upon the intellectual imbecility\r\nthat resulted from the vice of the Pathic as being the essence of the\r\nνοῦσος θήλεια (feminine disease), and the bodily derangements as merely\r\nsecondary and dependent on the psychica disturbances. Thus to some\r\nextent they confounded cause and effect, putting one for the other; yet\r\nwithout hitting on the true explanation, against which the meritorious\r\n_Stark_ has tried so hard not perhaps to shut his eyes, but rather to\r\nforcibly remove it in any possible way out of the range of his ideas.\r\nFor this very reason it has pursued him from beginning to end of his\r\ninvestigations, and in spite of all his struggles has found at last a\r\nreluctant and partial recognition from him.\r\n\r\nAs to the remaining views cited above, no attentive reader surely needs\r\nany further confutation of these.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 § 20.\r\n\r\nWe have now, we think sufficiently, proved that _Herodotus_ as well\r\nas the other writers who use the expression νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine\r\ndisease), denoted by it merely a _Vice_, which lent a feminine\r\ncharacter to the behaviour and indeed to the whole look and mode\r\nof life of a man, assimilating him equally in body and in mind to\r\nthe woman. Throughout the enquiry we have kept our eyes fixed on\r\nthe _cause_ of this transformation; and we shall now find it easy\r\nto estimate the value of a passage of _Hippocrates_, originally\r\nbrought forward by _Mercurialis_ (loco citato, p. 143. Note 10.)\r\nlater by _Zwinger_[392] and others, but which _Stark_ in particular\r\nhas characterised as _a more complete delineation of the disease,\r\nmerely pointed out and named νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine disease)by\r\nHerodotus_. On the other hand _Bouhier_ specially and strenuously\r\ndenies the identity of the two, yet without accurately recognising the\r\ntrue relationship.\r\n\r\nHippocrates in his well-known Work on _Air, Water and Environment_,\r\ndescribes the country of the Scythians as a bare but well-watered\r\ntableland, with so cold and damp a climate that a heavy mist covered\r\nthe fields all day long and only a short summer was enjoyed. The\r\ninhabitants he says are arrogant, puffed up and exceedingly idle\r\ncreatures, in outward look and mode of life having little distinctly\r\nmarked characteristics of sex, the men having only very moderate desire\r\nfor coition, and the women, whose menstruation is less frequent,\r\npossessing little capacity for conception. Then he goes on[393]:\r\n“Moreover there are very many men amongst the Scythians resembling\r\nEunuchs (εὐνουχίαι); these not only follow women’s occupations\r\n(show feminine inclinations, behave as women?—γυναικεῖα ἐργάζονται)\r\njust like the women, but also bear a name signifying this, for such\r\nmen are called No-men (ἀνανδριεῖς). The natives ascribe the cause\r\nto a deity; they are afraid of these men, and show them a slavish\r\nrespect (προσκυνέουσι[394]), though each individual dreads such a\r\nfate for himself. It seems to me that affections of this sort may\r\nbe said to have come from a deity to exactly the same degree as all\r\nother diseases,—no single one is more than any other in a sense of\r\ndivine origin. Each one of them has its own peculiar nature, and\r\nnothing happens outside its nature. Now how these affections arise in\r\nmy opinion, I will proceed to state. From constant riding they get\r\nκέδματα[395] (varicose dilatations), because their feet always hang\r\naway from the horse. Hence they become lame, and get, those that are\r\nseriously ill, ulcers on the hips (in the region of the _ischium_,\r\nfestering of the _cotyla_ or joint-socket?[396]). Then they treat\r\nthemselves with a view to cure in the following fashion. So soon as\r\nthe complaint breaks out, they open their veins on either side of the\r\near; then when the blood has flowed, they fall asleep from weakness,\r\nand go on sleeping till they wake, some of them cured and some of\r\nthem not. But it appears to me that by such a treatment they ruin\r\nthemselves[397]. For there lie near the ears certain veins, and\r\nwhen these are severed, the men so cut become seedless (unfruitful);\r\nand it is these veins that, _as I think_, they sever. But when\r\nsubsequently they approach women, and find themselves in no condition\r\nto use them (to consummate coition with them), at the first they are\r\nnot discouraged, but keep quiet. However later, after they have tried\r\ntwice, three times, or oftener, with no better success, they believe\r\nthemselves to have sinned against the deity, whom they hold to be\r\nto blame, put on a woman’s frock, and acknowledge their unmanliness\r\n(ἀνανδρίην), behave as women, and in company with the women perform the\r\nsame tasks as they do. The like of this however happens only to the\r\nrich Scythians, not to the poor, in fact to the nobler classes and such\r\nas have attained to some considerable wealth, to a smaller degree to\r\nthose of lesser position, because these latter do not ride.\r\n\r\nBut surely the complaint, since it is above all others of divine\r\norigin, must attack not solely the noblest and richest Scythians, but\r\nall equally,—or even to a greater extent those who possess little,\r\nand therefore fail to make offerings; if that is to say the gods take\r\npleasure in (active) veneration on the part of men and see that they\r\nwin a due return for it[398]. For naturally the rich offer much to\r\nthe gods, bring correspondingly great contributions from their goods\r\nas marks of their veneration; but the poor less, because they possess\r\nnothing. Then are these discontented, because they have given them no\r\nwealth; so that those who possess little suffer more of the punishments\r\nfor such faults than the rich. But as a matter of fact, as I have said\r\nbefore, these things come from the deity to just the same degree as the\r\nothers; for everything happens in accordance with nature, and so does\r\nthis affection arise among the Scythians from the original cause I have\r\npointed out. Now it is precisely the same among the rest of mankind;\r\nwhere riding is practised most and most continuously, there very many\r\nsuffer from κέδματα (varicose dilatations), hip and foot affections,\r\nand accomplish coition very badly (are only slightly disposed to\r\ncoition). And this is the case with the Scythians, and they are of all\r\nmen most like eunuchs, for the following reasons: Because they always\r\nwear trousers, and besides that pass the greatest part of their time\r\non horseback, so that they cannot touch the genitals with the hand,\r\nthrough cold and lassitude forget the desire for coition and coition\r\nitself, and (in their senseless infatuation) think of nothing else but\r\nhow to resign their manly privilege[399]. This is an account of how it\r\nis with the stock of the Scythians.”\r\n\r\nNow if we separate the facts which are brought forward in this passage\r\nof Hippocrates from his attempted explanations, there can be no doubt\r\nthat the same thing is in question here as that which Herodotus\r\ndescribes. There are men amongst the Scythians who behave as women,\r\nspeak as women, perform women’s work and keep with the women, and their\r\ncondition the Scythians consider as something sent by the deity, and\r\nfor this reason honour and fear these men. All the rest is part of\r\nthe attempted explanations of the author, who brings together every\r\npossible consideration in order to discover a natural cause of the\r\nphenomenon, leaving utterly and entirely unrecognized all the time the\r\nmost natural cause of all. This of course was due to no other reason\r\nexcept that it was _unknown_ to him, and that he was acquainted with\r\nthe circumstances not from his own observation, but only from hearsay.\r\nThis is a conjecture which _Heyne_ (_loco citato_) had already made\r\nin his time, but which has met with many opponents, yet without the\r\nargument having ever been properly brought to the test of the evidence.\r\nIn favour of Heyne’s view a passage from the book περὶ ἄρθρων (On\r\nJoints)[400] might be cited, in which the limping of the men of the\r\nAmazons in consequence of the dislocation of the limbs is clearly\r\ndeclared to be an unauthenticated myth; for which reason _Gruner_[401]\r\ndenied Hippocrates’ authorship of this work in opposition to the\r\ngeneral witness of Antiquity.\r\n\r\nBut really and truly we are as well without the passage; for if what he\r\nrelates were the result of his own observation, how could the author\r\nwrite in connexion with his remark that the Scythians bled themselves\r\nbehind the ears, ταύτας τοίνυν _μοι δοκέουσι_ τὰς φλέβας ἐπιτάμνειν\r\n(now these are the veins, _as it seems to me_, that they cut)? Is the\r\nactual fact possibly, that all these attempted explanations flowed\r\nfrom the pen of some later, or of several later, writers? At any rate\r\nfor ourselves, we have never yet been able to get rid of a suspicion\r\nto that effect. But be this as it may, so much at least is certain,\r\nas was stated above; viz. that the Author was unacquainted with the\r\nactual cause of attempts to explain it, probably from misunderstanding\r\nthe effemination of the Scythians, and that all of the words ἀνανδρίες\r\nand εὐνουχίαι (unmanly, eunuch-like), aim at referring the loss of the\r\ngenerative power, i.e. ἀνανδρία in its strict sense, to some natural\r\nreason, while the effemination is looked upon merely as a secondary\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nThat Hippocrates was not, any more than the later Physicians of\r\nantiquity, fully and exactly acquainted with the consequences of the\r\nvice of the Pathic as affecting the body, we see from the following\r\npassage, appearing in an exceedingly corrupt form in the text of\r\nFoesius[402]: εὐνοῦχος ἐκ κυνηγεσίης καὶ διαδρομῆς ὑδραγωγὸς γίνεται·\r\nὁ παρὰ τὴν Ἐλεαλκέος κρήνην· ὁ περὶ τὰ ἓξ ἄτεα _ἱππουρίν_ τε καὶ\r\nβουβῶνα καὶ _ἴξιν_ καὶ κέδματα· ὁ τὸν _κενεῶνα_ φθινήσας ἑβδομαῖος\r\nἀπέθανεν, _προπιούντων ἄπεπτον_, ἁλμυρὰ μετὰ μέλιτος· _πορνείη ἄχρωμος_\r\nδυσεντερίης ἄκος. (a eunuch by hunting or running becomes dropsical;\r\nhe that is beside the fountain of Elealces; he that about six years\r\n[suffered from] “_horse-tail_” [a disease of the groin due to too\r\nmuch riding], swelling of the groin, _varicocele_ and dilatations;\r\nhe that was sick in the _flank_ died the seventh day, when they were\r\nabout to administer a raw drink, salt liquid with honey; inordinate\r\nfornication is a cure for dysentery.??) All editors of Hippocrates\r\nhave been especially scandalized by the connection in which πορνείη\r\nἄχρωμος (inordinate fornication) stands in this passage; only _Foesius_\r\ndefended it, referring to other passages in _Aëtius_[403] and _Paul\r\nof Aegina_[404], in which coition is recommended in chronic diarrhœa\r\nas drying up the humours. This he might equally well have established\r\nfrom Hippocrates himself, for the latter says (Epidem. bk. VI. sect. 5.\r\nnote 29.), λαγνεία τῶν ἀπὸ φλέγματος νούσων ὠφέλιμον (lasciviousness\r\nis advantageous in diseases that arise from phlegm) and (note 26.),\r\nμίξις τὰ κατὰ τὴν γαστέρα σκληρύνει (sexual intercourse hardens the\r\ncontents of the belly)[405]. However this holds good only of the\r\nman who performs coition, inasmuch as the effusion of semen compels\r\nthe body to supply what is lost, and this can only be done at the\r\ncost of other secretions, and so must stop the flow of any morbid\r\nsecretions as well to a greater or less degree. But the question here\r\nis not of the coition the man performs, but of that which he suffers\r\nanother to perform on him, in fact the vice of the Pathic, as the word\r\n(fornication) clearly shows; and that Pathics have habitually a pallid\r\ncomplexion has been already mentioned (p. 144).\r\n\r\nTo bring some sort of sense into the passage quoted above,\r\n_Mercurialis_ would read πόρνη ὡς ἄχρωμος (like a shameless\r\nharlot), _Dacier_ πορνείη ἄχρωμον ἄκος, (fornication is a shameless\r\nremedy ...) and _Richard Mead_ προῤῥοὴ ἄχρωμος (an inordinate\r\neffusion). But _Triller_[406] was the first to come to the conclusion\r\nthat the words were in the wrong order, and emends the sentence thus:\r\nὁ τὸν _αἰῶνα_ φθινήσας, _πορνείῃ_ ἄχρωμος, ἑβδομαῖος ἀπέθανεν,\r\n_προϊόντων ἀπέπτων_. Ἁλμυρὰ μετὰ μέλιτος δυσεντερίης ἄκος, (he that\r\ndestroyed his life and vigour, being inordinate in fornication, died\r\non the seventh day, undigested matters coming from him. Salt drinks\r\nwith honey are a remedy for dysentery). This certainly makes it more\r\nreadable, particularly if πορνείη ἄχρωμος is put _before_ ὁ τὸν αἰῶνα,\r\ninasmuch as the pallid complexion was undoubtedly a forerunner of\r\nphthisis. His reasons, which we beg the reader to peruse for himself in\r\nthe author’s work, are at any rate to us so convincing that we do not\r\nhesitate a moment to adopt his emendations. These have unfortunately\r\nhitherto gone entirely unnoticed; for _Grimm_, who appears to have\r\ntaken no exception to the passage generally, has translated entirely\r\nin accordance with the old text, and not added any note at all. The\r\nsame is the case with _Lilienhain_, who has more recently gone over the\r\nsame ground again; though both have restored instead of κενεῶνα (belly)\r\nαἰῶνα (life) previously conjectured by _Foesius_.\r\n\r\nGranted that by these means the last sentence is made intelligible, and\r\njustice done Hippocrates by no longer making him recommend coition as a\r\nremedy against dysentery, still the preceding sentence likewise stands\r\nin need of correction. For ἴξιν obviously ἰξίαν or ἰξίας (varicosities)\r\nmust be read, which indeed was done by former translators, and long\r\nago suggested by Foesius; but as to ἱππουρίν, no sufficient account\r\nhas ever yet been given by any editor. The word appears to us to be\r\ncorrupt, and to have got into the text owing to the fact that in the\r\nManuscript, instead of προπιούντων,—which indeed no single Codex has,\r\nthe majority reading ὑποπνοιούντων, there stood in the next line\r\nὑποπορούντων, ὑποῤῥυόντων or ὑπποῤῥεόντων. _Cornarius_ read, περὶ ἓξ\r\nἔτεα _ἐξ ἱππασίης_ βουβῶνα, ἰξίας, κ. τ. λ. (for about six years, _in\r\nconsequence of riding_, inguinal swellings, varicosities, etc.), but\r\nwithout assigning his reasons; in all probability however he made this\r\nconjecture, which does not commend itself at any rate to us, with the\r\npassage about the Scythians in his mind’s eye.\r\n\r\nBut we can only arrive at a probable emendation on the condition that\r\nwe correctly estimate the sequence of the sentences as a whole. If we\r\nare not greatly mistaken, it is as follows: First of all the question\r\nis of a Eunuch who became dropsical; then in connection with this, the\r\n_rest_ is added applying to _another Eunuch_. In the Book περὶ γονῆς\r\n(Of the Seed), (Vol. I. p. 273. K.) we read: οἱ δὲ εὐνοῦχοι διὰ ταῦτα\r\nοὐ λαγνεύουσιν, ὅτι σφέων ἡ δίοδος ἀμαλδύνεται τῆς γονῆς—αὕτη δὲ ἡ\r\nδίοδος ὑπὸ τῆς τομῆς _οὐλῆς_ γενομένης στερεὴ γέγονεν. (Now Eunuchs\r\nare not lascivious, because in them the passage of the seed is wasted\r\naway, ... and this passage has become hardened by the wound where they\r\nwere cut getting _skinned over but festering within_). Now we might\r\nwell be tempted to read in the text: ὁ περὶ τὰ ἓξ ἔτεα ὑπὸ τῆς τομῆς\r\nοὐλῆς καὶ βουβῶνα, that is to say, the man suffered for six years in\r\nconsequence of the skinning over of the cut from swelling in the groin,\r\netc. However this could hardly be justified, and we think it much\r\nbetter to join ὑπὸ and οὐλῆς and either to read ὕπουλος, ὑπουλῶς or\r\nὑπουλὴν περὶ τὰ βουβῶνα, that is, he had had for six years festering\r\nplaces in the inguinal region,—which idea possibly Calvus may have had\r\nin his mind, or else ὑπουλήν τε καὶ βουβῶνας, he had had for six years\r\nfestering places (fistulas), inguinal swellings, etc., or finally,\r\nwhat might seem the best of all, ὕπουλον βουβῶνα, a festering inguinal\r\nregion[407]. In the _De morbis mulierum_, (On the Diseases of Women),\r\nbk. I., edit Kühn, Vol. II. 680. we read, ὀδύνη ἔχει καὶ τὰς ἰξύας\r\nκαὶ τοὺς κενεῶνας καὶ τοῦς βουβῶνας (pain holds both the loins and\r\nbelly and the inguinal regions),—so we might perhaps similarly read\r\nhere, ὕπουλον (ἔχει) καὶ βουβῶνα καὶ ἰξύα καὶ κενεῶνα καὶ κέδματα,\r\nπορνείη ἄχρωμος, φθινήσας κ. τ. λ. (he has in a festering condition\r\nboth inguinal region and loin and belly and also varicosities, being\r\ninordinate in fornication, in pain etc.), which would give κέδματα\r\nthe meaning of _Varices_ (varicosities), and the sense of the whole\r\npassage would then be as follows: “A Eunuch in consequence of hunting\r\nand running became dropsical; another at the fountain of Elealces, who\r\nfor six years had had festering (fistulous) ulcers in the inguinal\r\nregion, the loins and in the region of the _os sacrum_, as well as\r\nvaricosities, had grown pallid and suffered wasting through indulgence\r\nin the vice of the pathic, died, after making involuntary evacuations,\r\nto counteract which he had taken salt with honey, a usual remedy\r\nagainst dysentery, on the seventh day.”\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, at any rate it is shown very distinctly by the\r\npassage that its author was but very slightly acquainted with the\r\nconsequences resulting from the vice of the Pathic, for he ascribes\r\nto it nothing but the pallidness of complexion, whereas the whole\r\nseries of morbid symptoms might very well have been due to it (Comp. p.\r\n180.). Certainly the Author is to be excused, for as a rule the bodily\r\nconsequences resulting from the vice of the Pathic were in Greece very\r\nslight and of rare occurrence, neither did the vice in that country\r\nreach anything like such a height. Again among the pastoral Scythians,\r\nwhose racial character in other respects was but little marked, the\r\nlocal bodily consequences fell rather into the background, while the\r\nassimilation of the whole person to the female type occurred the\r\nmore readily; but at the same time stood out all the more glaringly\r\nconspicuous to the eyes of a foreign observer, as he had noted nothing\r\nto correspond at home. Thus it was easy for him to be misled in\r\nconsidering the marvellous phœnomenon into forgetting its real origin,\r\nwhich no doubt was, in seeming, somewhat remote; and was apt to think\r\nof any other cause rather than the vice of the pathic, the consequences\r\nof which even distinguished Physicians of more modern times failed\r\nadequately to appreciate. Is it for us to throw a stone on these\r\ngrounds at Hippocrates and his contemporaries?\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of our view as to the νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine disease)\r\nwe might further cite from more modern times the examples given by\r\n_Reineggs_ and _J. von Potocki_ in the case of the Mongolian race of\r\nthe Nogay, and by the older Historians of America, particularly in\r\nconnection with Florida and Mexico. Notoriously down to the present day\r\nPaederastia is in Asia one of the common vices, while as to America\r\nsome reporters when speaking of the Men-women and Hermaphrodites of\r\nthat Continent, expressly state that they indulged in the vice. But\r\nas the original Authorities are not accessible to us, we can only\r\nrefer to _Heyne_, loco citato, p. 41. and _Stark_, loco citato, pp. 29\r\nand 31., especially as without this the subject has already occupied\r\novermuch space. Still we trust the less blame may attach to us on this\r\naccount from the fact that so distinguished a scholar as _Stark_, whose\r\nconclusions even professed Philologists have endorsed, may naturally\r\nclaim of a younger enquirer in the same field who challenges his views,\r\nnot mere general phrases, but the most complete and satisfactory\r\nreasons possible. This much merit we trust he cannot deny us!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n                      AUTHORITIES AND HISTORIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AUTHORITIES.\r\n\r\n1) _Nicolai Leoniceni_, Vicentini, et _Joannis Almenar_, Hispani, 1.\r\nde morbo Gallico, _Angeli Bolognini_, Bononiensis, de cura ulcerum\r\nexteriorum et unguentis communibus in solutione continui lib.

It runs thus: “M. _Castro_, Médecin de Londres, ayant\r\ntraduit en Anglais une dissertation avec ce titre: Sur l’origine de\r\nla Maladie Vénérienne; imprimée à Paris, chez Durand 1750, envoya un\r\nExemplaire de la traduction à M. le Baron de Van-Swieten”,—M. _Castro_,\r\nPhysician in London, having translated into English a Dissertation\r\nentitled: _On the Origin of the Venereal Disease_; printed at Paris\r\n1750, and published by Durand, sent a Copy of the Translation to the\r\nBaron Van-Swieten). The Title of this English Translation is: “_A\r\nDissertation on the Origin of Venereal Disease; proving that it was not\r\nbrought from America, but began in Europe by an Epidemical Distemper.\r\nTranslated from the original MS. by an Eminent Physician_”.

In the history of Medicine\r\nthere is no Description of an epidemic Disease resembling in all its\r\nconsequences that which invaded Italy, Spain and France in the years\r\n1493 and 1494. pp. 31-42.—Div. 4. The Venereal attacks, which have\r\nbeen observed since the time of Hippocrates, were not the consequence\r\nof the inflammatory or chronic Venereal Disease, such as it has\r\nbeen observed since the years 1493 and 1494. pp. 42-45.—Div. 5. On\r\ncertain passages in _Astruc’s_ book “On the Venereal Disease”. pp.\r\n45-54.—Div. 6. Conclusions from the passages of Pet. Pintor and Pet.\r\nDelphinus concerning the Venereal Epidemic in Italy, France and Spain\r\nin the years 1493, 1494. pp. 54-61.—Div. 7. Did the early Voyages who\r\ndiscovered the Harbours and Peoples of North and South America observe\r\nthe Venereal Disease, and was their Manhood infected with it? pp.\r\n62-72.—Div. 8. On the Spread of infectious Diseases by sea, and the\r\nQuarantine observed during the Plague on the different coasts of the\r\nMediterranean Sea. pp. 73-81.—_Recapitulation_: The Venereal Disease\r\nprevailed as a “Febris Pestilentialis” (pestilential fever) in March\r\n1493, and after the arrival of Charles VIII in Italy (1494) took the\r\nname of “Morbus Gallicus” (French Complaint); the Venereal affections\r\nobserved in Antiquity are distinct from the Venereal Disease as known\r\nsince 1494; the Spaniards imported it into the Antilles, and the French\r\nwere already infected when they came into Italy, where the Disease had\r\nbeen prevalent before their arrival. The early Voyages mention not a\r\nword of having found the Disease among the Savages. America, Africa\r\nand the East Indies have never communicated their epidemic and endemic\r\nDiseases to Europe; therefore the Venereal Disease cannot have been\r\nbrought by the Spaniards from America to Europe.—Both Works of Sanchez\r\nare now rare.

Hensler_, ““Program” (College Exercise) on the _Herpes_\r\n(Creeping eruption) or _Formica_ of the Ancients,—a Malady not\r\nunconnected with the Venereal Disease.” Kiel 1801. pp. 64. 8vo.)\r\n\r\nThis “Program”, which _Hensler_ wrote on his resignation as Dean and\r\nfor the Public Announcement of certain Graduations, is divided into\r\n10 Divisions, of which Div. 1 gives a survey of the Contents, Div. 2\r\nconsiders certain passages from the genuine Writings of Hippocrates\r\n(Prorrhetic. 11, 18, 21, “de aere, aquis et locis”—“of the effects\r\nof air, water and locality”, II. Aphorism. V. 22.) dealing with\r\n_Herpes_, from which we gather that under the name _Herpes_ were\r\nunderstood eating (phagedenic) Ulcers, that the _Herpes esthiomenes_\r\nattacked especially the abdomen and the Genitals, that _Epinyctis_ was\r\npre-eminently a disease of adults, whence a suspicion arises of its\r\nbeing communicated by coition. Div. 3 gives medical opinion on the\r\ndifferent kinds of _Herpes_ down to _Celsus_. Div. 4 gives the same on\r\n_Epinyctis_, special importance being given to the pains at night. Div.\r\n5 discusses the _Therioma_ of _Celsus_ (V. 28. 3.), which according\r\nto _Pollux_, Onomast. IV. 15., specially affects the Genitals, and is\r\nclosely akin to the _Epinyctis_. Div. 6 gives the views of _Galen_ on\r\n_Herpes_. Div. 7. The Author proceeds to the _Formica_ of the Arabians,\r\nand shows that they have designated several distinct Skin-diseases by\r\nthis name. Div. 8 treats the views held by Arabic writers down to the\r\nXVth. Century; whilst Div. 9 gives the shape these views took _during_\r\nthe XVth. Century. In Div. 10 _Hensler_ draws the following conclusions\r\nfrom the evidence he has adduced: _Formica_ was the same thing as the\r\n_Herpes_ of the Greeks; under both names, yet by no means exclusively,\r\nwere indicated syphilitic affections. Immorality at all periods\r\ngenerated Venereal Disease, which arose at first rather sporadically,\r\nbut towards the end of the XVth. Century in consequence of its\r\nuniversal diffusion became virtually epidemic. The early neglect of\r\nEtiology, as well as the Galenian hypotheses of deteriorations of the\r\nhumours, stood in the way of the right understanding of the Disease.\r\nVenereal Disease is not a single Malady, but a Diathesis (General\r\nCondition of Body), which in accordance with time and circumstances\r\nmay manifest itself in different forms. “Hujusmodi vero lues mihi\r\nilla _omnis_ esse videtur, quae _ipso coitu_, quo quidem loco luis\r\npraecipuus focus est, facillime cum aliis _communicari_ et ad ipsam\r\nprolem propagari possit. _Summa_ ejus _genera_ esse equidem arbitror\r\n_Lepram_, malum, quod _Pians_ vocant, ipsamque Syphilidem.” “This\r\ncontagion seems to me to be a general one, and of this sort that it\r\nis capable of being very readily communicated to others by the act of\r\ncoition, where indeed is the chief _nidus_ of the Disease, and of being\r\npropagated even to posterity. Its main forms are, in _my_ opinion,\r\nLeprosy, a Malady called _Pians_, and Syphilis itself.” (p. 54). The\r\n_Pians_ would seem to be Pox, the seeds of which the Moors disseminated,\r\nSyphilis a “Morbus Europae inquilinus” (a Disease native to Europe).\r\nThe three Diseases are akin, and merge into one another.\r\n\r\n10) La America vindicada de la calumnia de haber sido madre del mal\r\nvenereo.

X. vv. 29, 30) are strictly forbidden, finally because _Don Isac\r\nAbarbanel_, born 1437, in his Exposition of the Prophets (printed\r\n1650), on Zachariah Ch. XIV. v. 12. says expressly, that the Disease\r\n“Zarfosim” occurs only amongst the “Goiem” (Gentiles) and not amongst\r\nthe Jews.

This work treats of the drug “Guajac”,\r\nand lays down the American origin of Venereal Disease as confidently\r\nas if the Author had been on the spot when it happened! The value of\r\nthe whole argument may be judged from this passage, “Our Creator willed\r\nthat from that same country whence Venereal Disease (el mal de las\r\nbuvas,—the malady of buboes) came, should come also the Means of its\r\ncure.”\r\n\r\n36) _Pet. de Jurgenew_, Luis venereae apud veteres vestigia.

His\r\nhistorical results are imperfect and one-sided, in so far as they are\r\ndirected solely to maintaining the American origin; but at the same\r\ntime his chronological Review of the Writers from 1475 to 1740 is even\r\nnow almost indispensable, as he gives comprehensive Extracts from all\r\nthe Works that were at his disposal, that fill the whole of the second\r\nVolume of his Book. Down to _Hensler_, almost all later Historians owe\r\nto him their Bibliography of Authorities, though they are not always\r\nhonest enough to specify the mine from which they drew their knowledge.\r\nAccording to _Bertrandi_, “Treatise on the Venereal Diseases”, transl.\r\nfrom the Italian by _C. H. Spohr_, Vol. I. p. 44.

Christoph Wilh. Cappel_, 1803. pp. XVI, 455. large\r\n8vo.).\r\n\r\nIn the _First_ Volume the Author gives, Bk. I. Pt. 1. pp. 1-57, a\r\nhistory of the Venereal disease, in which he employs every possible\r\nartifice and perversion of the facts in his endeavour to prove the\r\nAmerican origin of the Disease. In the _Second_ and _Third_ Vols. (in\r\nwhich the pages run on continuously, pp. 808) he gives a general review\r\nof all the Works that have appeared on Venereal disease from 1595 to\r\n1793, the total—including Supplements—amounting to 1912. As far as\r\n_Astruc_ served, he has often translated him word for word,—without\r\ndeclaring the fact. But as only those Works which support his own\r\nviews, in particular the American origin, are estimated with any\r\naccuracy, while the rest are summarily disposed of,—often without any\r\nprecise account of the Contents, it is properly speaking solely for the\r\nsake of the Titles that the Review as a whole is of use to Historians.\r\nA Continuation of this Bibliographical review is found in:\r\n\r\n_Heinr. August Hacker_, Literatur der syphilitischen Krankheiten vom\r\nJahr 1794 bis mit 1829, etc. Leipzig 1830. 264 S. gr. 8. (_Heinr.\r\nAugust Hacker_, “Literature of the Venereal Disease from the year 1794\r\ndown to and including 1829, etc.” Leipzig 1830. pp. 264. large 8vo.).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately a major portion of the Books, particularly of the foreign\r\nones, did not actually come into the hands of the Author, so that he\r\nwas forced often to content himself with merely citing the Titles;\r\nand in such as are more precisely designated, he omits, as indeed is\r\nthe case also with _Girtanner_, to give the length (pagination, or\r\nnumber of sheets) of the Works, from which at any rate a relative\r\njudgement might be made as to their completeness. Then since its\r\npublication almost another decade has passed, and the continuation of\r\nhis Collection is still awaited on the part of the Author; consequently\r\na second edition, carried on so as to cover the latest period, one\r\nthat has been very prolific in Literary productions, is both necessary\r\nand desirable, and in it what is deficient might easily be supplied.\r\nAgain from earlier Literature many additions might well be made and\r\nsupplements giving what was overlooked or only cursorily noted by\r\n_Girtanner_. However would it not on the whole be more expedient to\r\nundertake an entirely new Work dealing with the whole Literature of\r\nVenereal Disease, but on other principles than those of _Girtanner_?\r\nIndeed for such a task the use of a Library such as Göttingen would be\r\nrequired. It would undoubtedly be of very great utility.\r\n\r\n_George Rees_, On the primary Symptoms of the lues venerea, _with a\r\ncritical and chronological account of all the English writers on the\r\nsubject, from 1735 to 1785_.

The greater part of the\r\nWorks collected by him are no longer to be found. It is only too\r\nevident that the earlier administrators of the library, especially\r\nERSCH, so famous as a Historian of Literature, left the medical side\r\nalmost totally unconsidered; and what gaps the Administration of\r\nto-day has to fill up is sufficiently evidenced by the yearly Lists of\r\nAdditions.\r\n\r\n[2] The Bibliography of Authorities and Historians has been placed at\r\nthe end of the present volume.\r\n\r\n[3] “On the Venereal Disease in the Northern Provinces of European\r\nTurkey” in: Russian Compendium for Natural and Medical Science, edited\r\nby _Alex. Crichton_, _Jos. Rehmann_, _C. Fr. Burdach_, vol. I. Riga and\r\nLeipzig 1815. large 8vo. pp. 230.\r\n\r\n[4] “Geschichte der Lustseuche” (History of the Venereal Disease), Vol.\r\nI. p. 326.\r\n\r\n[5] _Celsus_, De re medica Bk. VI. ch. 18., “Proxima sunt ea,\r\nquae ad partes obscoenas pertinent, quarum apud Graecos vocabula\r\net tolerabilius se habent et accepta iam usu sunt, cum omni fere\r\nmedicorum volumine atque sermone iactentur, apud nos foediora verba, ne\r\nconsuetudine quidem aliqua verecundius loquentium commendata sunt.”\r\n\r\n(Next are particulars relating to the unmentionable parts; the name\r\nof these among the Greeks are less objectionable and are now accepted\r\nby usage, as they are freely employed by physicians both in books and\r\nspeech, whereas with ourselves the words are coarse, not approved by\r\nany customary use on the part of those who speak with any regard to\r\nmodesty.) How strictly the words, especially in the case of the poets,\r\nwere scrutinised in this respect even in later times still, is shown\r\nby the passage in _Aulus Gellius_, Noct. Attic. Bk. X. ch. 10.; and in\r\n_Petronius_, Satir. 132, Polyaenus says: Ne nominare quidem te (scil.\r\npenem) inter res serias fas est. Poenitentiam agere sermonis mei coepi,\r\nsecretoque rubore perfundi, quod oblitus verecundiae meae cum ea parte\r\ncorporis verba contulerim, quam ne ad cogitationem quidem admittere\r\nseverioris notae homines solent.”\r\n\r\n(It is forbidden even to mention thee (viz. the penis) in serious\r\ndiscourse. I have begun to do penance for my words and to feel the glow\r\nof a secret blush, because forgetful of my modesty I expressed in words\r\nthat part of the body, which men of the stricter type refuse to admit\r\neven into their thoughts.) So the collector of Priapeia appeals to the\r\nreader: Conveniens Latio pone supercilium! (Lay aside the disapproving\r\nfrown that befits Latium); and later on people used to say of such\r\ntalk, they wished to speak plain _Latin_, just as we say, speak _plain\r\nEnglish_; while the Greek would excuse himself by his ἄγροικος καὶ\r\nἄμουσός εἰμι, (I am but am unpolished rustic).\r\n\r\n[6] Satir.

Καὶ τὸ μὴ μίσγεσθαι γυναιξὶ, ἐν\r\nἱροῖς, μηδὲ ἀλούτους ἀπὸ γυναικῶν ἐς ἱρὰ ἐσιέναι, οὗτοι εἰσὶ οἱ\r\nπρῶτοι θρησκεύσαντες· _οἱ μὲν γὰρ ἄλλοι σχεδὸν πάντες ἄνθρωποι_, πλὴν\r\nΑἰγυπτίων καὶ Ἑλλήνων, _μίσγονται ἐν ἱροῖσι_.\r\n\r\n(And the practice of not having intercourse with women in temples, and\r\nnot going into temples unwashed after such intercourse, these practices\r\nthey were the first to observe as a matter of religion; _for almost\r\nall the rest of mankind_, except Egyptians and Greeks, _have sexual\r\nintercourse in temples_.) Comp. _Clement of Alexandria_, Stromat. bk.\r\nI. p. 361.\r\n\r\n[17] Already in his time St. Jerome affirmed: omnem concubitum\r\nconiugale esse peccatum, nisi causa procreandi sobolem (that all\r\nconjugal coition is a sin, except for the sake of begetting offspring);\r\nand _Andr. Beverland_ (de peccato originali—On Original Sin, p. 60.);\r\nIngenitum nefas nil aliud est, quam coeundi ista libido, (Inborn sin is\r\nnothing else than the foul craving for coition). With this should be\r\ncompared the view of _Lycurgus_, which _Plutarch_ cites in his life of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAlso _Athenaeus_ (Deipnosoph. Bk. XXI. p. 510.) says: προκριθείσης\r\nγοῦν τῆς' Ἀφροδίτης, αὕτη δ’ ἐστὶν ἡ ἡδονὴ, πάντα συνεταράχθη. (thus\r\nAphrodité being rather chosen,—now this is sensual pleasure,—all was\r\nthrown into confusion.) _Clement of Alexandria_, Paedog. bk. II. ch.\r\n10. Ψιλὴ γὰρ ἡδονὴ, κἂν ἐν γάμῳ παραληφθῇ, παράνομός ἐστι καὶ ἄδικος\r\nκαὶ ἄλογος. (For base pleasure—i.e. pleasure for its own sake,—even\r\nthough it have been enjoyed in wedlock, is unlawful and unjust and\r\nunreasonable.)—_Philo_, De opificio mundi, pp. 34, 35, 38. De Allegoria,\r\nII. p. 1100. ὄφιν εἶναι σύμβολον ἡδονῆς. (the snake is the symbol of\r\nsensual pleasure.) With some coarseness Rabbi Zahira explains the\r\nFall. The Tree, he says, that bore the forbidden fruit signifies the\r\ninstrument of generation in Man; not the Tree in the midst of the\r\ngarden of Eden, he comments, but the Tree in the midst of the body,\r\nwhich is not in the midmost of the garden, but in the midmost of the\r\nWoman, for it is there that the garden is planted. _Nork_, “Braminen\r\nund Rabinen,” (Brahmins and Rabbis).

Ephraim lived 379 A. D.):—It is Venus that led astray her\r\nfollowers, the Ishmaelites. Into our land also she came, how most\r\nabundantly do the sons of Hagar honour her.\r\n\r\n  A street-walker (they call) the Moon,\r\n  Like a courtesan they represent Venus.\r\n  Twain they call female among the Stars.\r\n  And not merely names are they,\r\n  Names without meaning, these female names,\r\n  Abounding in Wantonness are they in themselves.\r\n  For since they are the women of all men,\r\n  Who amongst them can be modest,\r\n  Who amongst them chaste,\r\n  Who exercised his wedlock after the fashion of the fowls?\r\n\r\nWho (otherwise than the Chaldaeans) introduced the Festival of that\r\nfrantic Goddess, at whose Solemnities Women practise harlotry?\r\n\r\n[23] Histor. Bk. I. ch. 199. Ἐπεὰν δὲ μιχθῇ, ἀποσιωσαμένη τῇ θεῷ,\r\nἀπαλλάσσεται ἐς τὰ οἰκία· καὶ τὠπὸ τούτου οὐκ οὕτω μέγα τί οἱ δώσεις\r\nὥς μιν λάμψεαι. (But after she has gone with a man, and so acquitted\r\nher obligation to the goddess, she returns to her home; and from\r\nthat time forth no gift however great will prevail with her.) The\r\nsame thing is related also by _Baruch_ VI. 42, 43. Comp. _Voss_ on\r\n_Virgil_, Georgics, II. 523 sqq. To this day we find amongst the bold\r\nsons of the Desert, the Arabians, some trace of this devotion of their\r\nfathers, Niebuhr writes (“Beschreibung von Arabien”—(Description of the\r\nArabians), Copenhagen 1772, p. 54. note.): “I read that the Europeans\r\nhave investigated with great erudition and eloquence the question, Num\r\ninter naturalis debiti et conjugalis officii egerium liceat psallere,\r\norare, etc.? (Whether in the performance of the debt of nature and\r\nthe conjugal office it is lawful to sing, to pray, and so on?) I do\r\nnot know what the Mohammedans have written on this matter. I have\r\nbeen assured that it is their custom to begin all their occupations\r\nwith the words; Bismallâh errachmân errachhîm (in the name of the\r\nmerciful and gracious God), and that they must say this also “ante\r\nconjugalis officii egerium (before the performance of the conjugal\r\noffice), and that no reputable man omits this.” So at the present day\r\nin Italy the courtesan bows before the image of her Madonna, before\r\nshe gives herself, and says to her, “Madonna, mi ajuta!” or “Madonna,\r\nmi perdonna!” (Madonna, be my aid!, Madonna, pardon me!) whilst she\r\ndraws a veil over her picture, and calls this Christianity! For the\r\nrest Constantine abolished the custom in question at Babylon and\r\nat Heliopolis, and destroyed the Temples of Venus at those places.\r\n_Eusebius_, Life of Constantine, III. p. 58. _Socrates_, Eccles. Hist.\r\nI. 18.\r\n\r\n[24] _Heeren_, “Ideen über Politik und Handel,” (Ideas on Political\r\nScience and Trade), Pt. I. 2. p. 257.\r\n\r\n[25] So we think we ought to understand the _κατα_πορνεύει τὰ θήλεα\r\nτέκνα (prostitute _down_ their female children) in the text, for the\r\nexpression is evidently formed on the same plan as the καθῆσθαι ἐπ’\r\nοἰκήματος (to sit down at a house of ill-fame in _Plato_, Charmides,\r\n163. c.; because the brothels lay near the harbour, and so in the more\r\nlow-lying region, away from Athens itself. In the same way the Romans\r\nused the verb _descendere_ (to go down), e. g. _Horace_, Satires I. 2.\r\n34., because the public houses of ill-fame at Rome were in the valley,\r\nin the Subura.\r\n\r\n[26] Hist. of Alexander the Great, Bk.

(Moreover the chief men\r\nof the nation consecrate their daughters when still virgins, and it\r\nis the custom for these, after acting as prostitutes for a long time\r\nin the service of the goddess, then to be given in marriage). Hence\r\nthe Scholiast also to _Juvenal_, Satir. I. 104, “Mesopotameni homines\r\neffrenatae libidinis sunt in utroque sexu, ut Salustius meminit,”\r\n(The inhabitants of Mesopotamia are people of unbridled lustfulness\r\nin either sex, as Sallust records); and _Cedrenus_, Chaldaeorum et\r\nBabyloniorum leges plenae sunt impudicitiae atque turpitudinis, (the\r\nlaws of the Chaldaeans and Babylonians are full of indecency and\r\nfoulness).\r\n\r\n[28] Bk. I chs. 93, 94. The ἐνεργαζόμεναι παιδίσκαι (maids working\r\nat their handicraft) mentioned in this passage are maids who, to use\r\nHeine’s expression, practice their _horizontal_ craft.

But this vow was broken, and when they were waging a disastrous\r\nwar with the Lucanians, Dionysius calls them to an assembly, wherein\r\nhe urges them to send their wives and daughters to the Temple of Venus\r\nin the gayest array they could, and that of these a hundred should\r\nbe chosen by lot to carry out the public vow; that to fulfil the\r\nobligation to the goddess they should stand publicly in a brothel one\r\nmonth, all men having previously bound themselves by oath that none\r\nshould deflower any one of them. Further that this thing should be no\r\ndetriment to the maidens who so freed the city of its vow, a decree\r\nshould be passed to the effect that no maiden might marry, until these\r\nwere given to husbands; etc.).

(but\r\nthey receive not just the first-comers amongst the strangers, but by\r\npreference those of an equal position).\r\n\r\n[43] So even in the Middle Ages, e. g. at Venice, it was quite usual\r\nfor the daughters to earn their dowry by selling their bodies, and\r\nthere, as in France, it was the mothers who acted as procuresses to\r\ntheir daughters with this object. _Stephanus_, “Apologie d’Herodote”,\r\nVol. I. pp. 46-49. _Fr.

Hence what is asserted of the Devâdasis or\r\nPriestesses of the gods as being courtesans for the Priests is also\r\nin the main untrue, since it rests, as in the case of the Hieroduli,\r\nchiefly on a confusion with the Bhayatri (Bayaderes, the Hetaerae\r\nof the Greeks), or holds good only for particular places (_Häfner_,\r\n“Landreise längs der Küste Orixa und Koromandel,”—(Journey along the\r\nOrissa and Coromandel Coast).

I. p.\r\n40, that during his residence in a Hindoo town he had been informed,\r\nthat it would be unsafe at the present moment to allow foreigners to\r\nvisit the Devadâsis, on the contrary that there was nothing to fear\r\nfrom those attached to the Pagoda of the place. Even if we admit the\r\ntruth of this narrative for more modern times too, still the conclusion\r\nthat _Schaufus_ draws from it, that in Hindostan every Pagoda is a\r\nbrothel, is surely somewhat hasty.—Some other legends of the origin of\r\nthe Lingam ritual in India are given in _Meiner’s_ “Allgem. kritische\r\nGeschichte der Religionen,” (Universal Critical History of Religions),\r\nVol. I.

(Now the\r\nfoam-sprung, Cyprus-born goddess, the patroness of Cinyras, Aphrodité\r\nI mean, _she that loves the parts of a man, because from them she\r\nsprung_, to wit those parts that were lopped off from Uranus, those\r\nlewd parts which after their severance violated the sea-wave. Of such\r\nfoul components is Aphrodité the worthy child in the mysteries).\r\n\r\n[76] _Minutoli_, “Reise zum Tempel des Jupiter Ammon,” (Journey to the\r\nTemple of Jupiter Ammon), p. 121.—_Münter_, “Religion der Babylonier,”\r\n(Religion of the Babylonians), p. 130.\r\n\r\n[77] Bk.

(And the practice of not having intercourse with\r\nwomen in temples, and not going into temples unwashed after such\r\nintercourse, these practices they were the first to observe as a matter\r\nof religion; for almost all the rest of mankind, except Egyptians and\r\nGreeks, have sexual intercourse in temples). Comp. also _Clement of\r\nAlexandria_, Stromat. Bk. I. p. 361.\r\n\r\n[79] Geogr. Bk. XVII, ch. 46. Τῷ δὲ Διΐ, ὃν μάλιστα τιμῶσιν,\r\nεὐειδεστάτη καὶ γένους λαμπροτάτου παρθένος ἱερᾶται, ἃς καλοῦσι οἱ\r\nἝλληνες Παλλάδας· αὕτη δὲ καὶ παλλακεύει, καὶ σύνεστιν οἷς βούλεται,\r\nμέχρις ἂν ἡ φυσικὴ γένηται τοῦ σώματος κάθαρσις· μετὰ δὲ τὴν κάθαρσιν\r\nδίδοται πρὸς ἄνδρας. (And to Zeus, whom they reverence most, a maiden,\r\nmost beautiful and of highest lineage, is consecrated, and these\r\npriestesses the Greeks call Pallades. And she acts as a courtesan, and\r\nlies with whom she pleases, until the natural purging (menstruation) of\r\nthe body begins. And after this she is given in marriage). So here we\r\nfind brought into connection with the Zeus of the Egyptians the same\r\npractice we observed amongst Asiatics in the Venus cult.\r\n\r\n[80] According to _Herodotus_, bk. II. 51., the Greeks borrowed the\r\nPhallic ritual under the form of the Hermae (pillars of Hermes)\r\nfrom the Pelasgians, by which name according to _Böttiger_,\r\n“Kunstmythologie,” (Mythology of Art), p. 213, Phoenicians should\r\nbe understood.

But it is\r\nalso found in the _Scholiast_ to _Aristophanes_, Acharn. l. 242: ὁ\r\nΞανθίας τὸν φαλλὸν.—περὶ δὲ αὐτοῦ τοῦ φαλλοῦ τοιαῦτα λέγεται. Πήγασος\r\nἐκ τῶν Ἐλευθήρων λαβὼν τοῦ Διονύσου τὰ ἀγάλματα ἧκεν εἰς τὴν Ἀττικήν·\r\nοἱ δὲ Ἀττικοὶ οὐκ ἐδέξαντο μετὰ τιμῆς τὸν θεόν· ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἀμισθί γε\r\nαὐτοῖς ταῦτα βουλευσαμένοις ἀπέβη. μηνίσαντος γὰρ τοῦ θεοῦ, _νόσος\r\nκατέσκηψεν εἰς τὰ αἰδοῖα τῶν ἀνδρῶν_, καὶ τὸ δεινὸν ἀνήκεστον ἦν, ὡς δὲ\r\nἀπεῖπον πρὸς τὴν νόσον κρείττω γενομένην πάσης μαγγανείας καὶ τέχνης,\r\nἀπεστάλησαν θεωροὶ μετὰ σπουδῆς· οἱ δὲ ἐπανελθόντες ἔφασαν ἴασιν εἶναι\r\nμόνην ταύτην, εἰ διὰ πάσης τιμῆς ἄγοιεν τὸν θεόν· πεισθέντες οὖν τοῖς\r\nἠγγελμένοις οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι, φαλλοὺς ἰδίᾳ τε καὶ δημοσίᾳ κατεσκεύασαν,\r\nκαὶ τούτοις ἐγέραιρον τὸν θεόν, ὑπόμνημα ποιούμενοι πάθους. (Xanthias\r\nmentions _the Phallus_.—Now about the Phallus itself the following\r\nstory is told. Pegasus removed the statues of Dionysus at Eleutherae\r\nfrom there, and came to Athens with them. However the Athenians did\r\nnot receive the god with due honour. But for this ill counsel they by\r\nno means got off scot-free; for the god was wroth, and a disease fell\r\nupon the private parts of the men. The plague was incurable; and after\r\nthey had tried in vain every device of magic art and physician’s skill\r\nagainst the disease that only grew the more, envoys were despatched\r\nwith all speed to the oracle. So these went up, and brought back the\r\nreply that the only remedy was this, that they should bring in the\r\ngod in procession with all possible honour. Therefore the Athenians,\r\nsubmitting themselves to what was reported as the will of heaven,\r\nmade phalli—private and public, and presented them to the god as a\r\ncomplimentary gift, thus commemorating the affliction). A different\r\nexplanation from this is given by the _Scholiast_ to _Lucian_, “De Syra\r\ndea,” (Of the Syrian goddess), ch. 16., where the Phallus service is\r\nbrought in a measure into connection with Paederastia.\r\n\r\n[82] Comp. _Pausanias_, Descriptio Graeciae bk. I. ch. 2.\r\n\r\n[83] I. ch. p. 528.; perhaps following _Posidonius_, “De heroibus et\r\ndaemonibus,” (Of heroes and demigods)? comp. p. 391. But _Servius_\r\non Virgil, Georgics IV. 111., also has this legend. _Suidas_, under\r\nthe word πρίαπος. _Scioppius_, who likewise relates it in his edition\r\nof the Priapeia, adds: fuit autem morbus ille quem hodie _Gallicum\r\nvocamus_, (but it was the disease which _we nowadays call the French\r\ndisease_—Siphylis).\r\n\r\n[84] _Diodorus Siculus_, Bk. IV. ch. 4., says of Bacchus: He had a\r\ntender body and was extremely effeminate; his beauty distinguished\r\nhim above all others, and his temper was strongly inclined to\r\nvoluptuousness. On his progresses he used to take with him a crowd of\r\nwomen, etc. _Clement of Alexandria_, Paedag. Bk. II. ch. 2., Ὀργῶσι\r\nγοῦν ἀναιδέστερον ἀναξέοντες οἴνου, καὶ οἰδοῦσι μαστοί τε καὶ μόρια,\r\nπροκηρύσσοντες ἤδη πορνείας εἰκόνα. (So they revel shamelessly being\r\nfull of wine, and breasts and members swell, showing forth already an\r\nimage of harlotry). Sufficiently noteworthy is the following passage\r\nfrom _Augustine_, De Civit. Dei bk. VI. ch. 4., Liberum a liberamento\r\nappellatum volunt, quod mares a coeundo per eius beneficium emissis\r\nseminibus liberentur; hoc idem in feminis agere _Liberam_ quam etiam\r\nVenerem putant, quod et ipsas perhibeant semina emittere et ob hoc\r\nLibero eamdem virilis corporis partem in templo poni, femineam Liberae.\r\n(The name of Liber (Bacchus) they derive from _liberamentum_, the act\r\nof freeing, because males in the act of coition are freed by his aid\r\nwhen the seed is emitted; the same function they consider Libera, who\r\nis identified with Venus, to perform for women, because they say that\r\nwomen also emit seed, and that for this reason that same part of the\r\nmale body is consecrated to Liber in his temple, and the corresponding\r\nfemale part to Libera).\r\n\r\n[85] Juno was not merely the Patron goddess of the birth-hour, but\r\nalso of fornication. Comp. _Dousa_, Praecidan. pro Tibullo, ch.\r\n18.—Politian, Miscell. ch. 89. Hence also “filles de joies” used to\r\nswear by Juno, as we see from Tibullus, Bk. III.

Bk. IV. Eleg. 18.,\r\n\r\n  Haec per sancta tuae Junonis nomina iuro,\r\n    Quae sola ante alios est mihi magna Deos.\r\n\r\n(This by the holy divinity of Juno, thy goddess, I swear, who alone\r\nbefore other deities is great in my eyes); and also from _Petronius_,\r\nwho (Satir. ch. 25.) makes a “fille de joie” declare: Junonem meam\r\niratam habeam, si unquam meminerim virginem fuisse (Juno my patron\r\ngoddess be wroth with me, if ever I remember to have been a maid).\r\nAccording to _Lucian_, De Syra Dea ch. 16., Bacchus dedicated to Juno\r\nnoverca (stepmother) divers Phalli.\r\n\r\n[86] The Greeks used to make little figures of men with big\r\ngenitals of wood, which they called Νευρόσπαστα (figures moved by\r\nstrings, puppets). _Lucian_, De Syra Dea ch. 16. _Herodotus_, II.\r\n48. _Diodorus_, I. 88.—_Hesychius_ says: νάνος· ἐπὶ τῶν μικρῶν· ὡς\r\nνάνον καὶ αἰδοῖον ἔχοντα μέγα· οἱ γοῦν νάνοι μεγάλα ἔχουσιν αἰδοῖα,\r\n(_dwarf_: applied to the undersized; dwarf, but having large private\r\nparts. Dwarfs _do_ have large private parts). Which reminds us of the\r\nunhappy “cretins” with monstrous generative organs, who are notoriously\r\npassionate Onanists (Masturbators) also.\r\n\r\n[87] “_Priapeia_, sive diversorum poetarum in Priapum lusus, illustrati\r\ncommentariis Casp.

No. 3.:\r\n\r\n  _Ἑστηκὸς_ τὸ Κίμωνος ἰδὼν _πέος_, εἶφ’ ὁ Πρίηπος,\r\n  Οἴμοι, ὑπὸ θνητοῦ λείπομαι ἀθάνατος.\r\n\r\n(When Priapus saw Cimon’s penis standing stiff, he said, “Woe’s me!” I\r\nam thrown in the shade by a mortal, immortal though I be).\r\n\r\n[89] In the Codex Coburgensis the Priapeia begin with the following\r\nwords: P. Virgilii Maronis Mantuani poetae clarissimi Priapi carmen\r\nincipit feliciter, (the Song of Priapus by Publius Virgilius Maro, of\r\nMantua, the renowned poet, begins happily). Comp. _Bruckhusius_ Notes\r\nto Tibullus bk. IV. Eleg. 14. At any rate the majority of the poems\r\nbelong to the golden age of Roman literature. For readers of the old\r\npoets it may perhaps not be out of place here to remark that _Priapus_\r\nas _Cultor Hortorum_ (Patron of Gardens) is not unfrequently mentioned\r\nwith an equivocal meaning, if indeed he has not come into the garden\r\nentirely through misunderstanding. So we read in Priapeia, Ode 4.,\r\n\r\n  Quod metis hortus habet, sumas impune licebit;\r\n  Si dederis nobis, quod tuus hortus habet,\r\n\r\n(What my garden has thou mayest take at will, if only thou give to us\r\nwhat thine possesses) and in the “Anechomenos” of _Apuleius_.\r\n\r\n  Thyrsumque pangant hortulo in Cupidinis,\r\n\r\n(Let them plant the thyrsus (Bacchic staff) in the garden-plat of\r\nCupid). Similarly _Lucretius_, Bk. IV. 1100., says, ut muliebria\r\nconserat arva, (to sow the woman’s seed-fields), and _Virgil_, Georgics\r\nIII. 136., speaks of, genitali arvo, (the seed-field of generation).\r\nPossibly in this direction may be found a better interpretation of\r\nthe, irriguo nihil est elutius horto, (There is nought more insipid\r\nthan a new-watered garden), of _Horace_, Satires Bk. II. 4. 16. The\r\nGreeks used in the same way their word κῆπος (garden), e. g. _Diogenes\r\nLaertius_, II. 12, and _Hesychius_ explains it by τὸ ἐφήβιον γυναικεῖον\r\n(the female organ of puberty). Similarly in _Aristophanes_ καλὸν\r\nἔχουσα τὸ πεδίον, (having the plain beautiful). The Koran also says,\r\nThy Wife is thy field!\r\n\r\n[90] “Apologie pour Herodote,” (Defence of Herodotus), II., 253.\r\n\r\n[91] _Strabo_, bk. XIII. 588.\r\n\r\n[92] _Lucian_, De Dea Syra, § 28., relates that at Hieropolis there was\r\na Phallus 180 or 1800 feet in size.\r\n\r\n[93] _Creuzer_, Symbolik, Bk.

Might one draw attention to\r\nthe old Greek πέος (the penis), which is found in _Aristophanes_ and\r\n_Antipater_,—p. 72. Note 2. loco citato? The adjective πεοίδης (πεώδης)\r\nis given in _Eustathius_ according to _Schneider_, in the sense: with\r\nthick, swollen member; and _Rodigin_, Lect. Antiq. Bk. VIII. ch. 6. p.\r\n377, says: Postremo qui ex intemperanti Veneris usu pereunt, dicuntur\r\n_Peolae_, media producta, quia Peos signet pudendum, sive veretrum,\r\n(Lastly those who are undone by excessive indulgence in Love are called\r\n_Peolae_, with the middle vowel long, because _Peos_ means the private,\r\nor privy, member. Possibly the old form was πέορ, just as sometimes\r\nπόϊρ stands for πάϊς in the Laconian dialect. Moreover _Penis_ might\r\nsurely more readily be derived from πέος than from what is commonly\r\ngiven as its derivation, _pendendo_ (because it hangs), in as much as\r\nthe parts of the body are named from the condition of their activity,\r\nnot of their rest. Thus Baal-_Peor_ would be “Lord of the Penis”! ἄναξ\r\nΠρίηπος (King Priapus).\r\n\r\n[96] _Lintschotten_, “Orientalische Reisen,” (Eastern Travels), Pt I.\r\nch. 33.—_Beyer_ on _Seldens_, Syntagm. de Diis Syris, p. 235. perhaps\r\nthe Greeks called the penis also κτείς on this account,—κτεὶς from\r\nκτέω, I cleave!\r\n\r\n[97] _Gynaeologie_, Vol. II. p. 337.

So Balaam says in _Josephus_ (loco\r\ncit. § 6.): Hebraeorum quidem genus nunquam funditus peribit, nec\r\nbello, nec _peste_, nec inopia terrae fructuum, nec alio casu\r\ninopinato delebitur.—In mala autem nonnulla et calamitates ad breve\r\ntempus incident; a quibus licet deprimi humique affligi videantur,\r\npostea tamen reflorescent, cum eos timere coeperint qui damna illis\r\nintulerant. (The nation of the Hebrews in fact will never utterly\r\nperish, and can be destroyed neither by war, nor _plague_, nor famine\r\nof the fruits of the earth, nor any other unlooked for disaster.—They\r\nwill fall however for a brief space into sundry ills and calamities;\r\nwhereby they may well seem to be broken down and brought to the earth.\r\nBut they will flourish again, when once they have learned to fear the\r\nenemies that brought the disasters upon them). It was in order to bring\r\nabout this consummation that Balaam gave his advice just cited.\r\n\r\n[108] In fact Moses gives direct permission to captives to wed.\r\n_Deuteronomy_ 21. vv. 11-13., “... and seest among the captives a\r\nbeautiful woman, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take\r\nher to thee to wife; then thou shalt bring her home to thine house,\r\n... after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and\r\nshe shall be thy wife.” Comp. besides _Ruth_, Ch. 1. v. 4., Ch. 4. v.\r\n13.—1 _Chronicles_, Ch. 2. v. 17.—1 _Kings_, Ch. 3. v. 1., Ch. 14. v.\r\n21.

Seeing the city crowded full of young men, _and\r\nthese possessed of the natural appetites of manhood, and consequently\r\noffending in quarters unmeet, bought women and established them\r\nin certain places to be common to all and put there for that very\r\npurpose_.

(He expresses extreme surprise,\r\nthough possibly you don’t all remember, at the fact that _every\r\nyear the senate sells the lease of the prostitution-tax_; and that\r\nthe purchasers do not conjecture, but know precisely, those who\r\npractise this calling. So when I have the audacity to counter-plead,\r\nthat Timarchus as having exercised the trade of prostitution is not\r\ncompetent to address the people, he does not deny the fact charged\r\nagainst his client by the accuser, but says, ‘I demand the evidence of\r\nany _tax-collector who collected this tax_ from Timarchus.’ ... but he\r\nwill cross-examine as to the localities where he was established in the\r\nbusiness, and will question the collectors as to whether they have ever\r\nlevied prostitution-tax upon him).\r\n\r\nThis passage shows at the same time in the clearest way that\r\n_Schneider_ is wrong, when in his Lexicon he explains πορνοτελώνης,\r\noccurring in _Pollux_. Onomast. VII. 202., IX. 29., as meaning a\r\nprivileged or licenced whore-master, paying a duty to the magistrates\r\non his trade. Besides, anything like a sanitary police supervision\r\non the part of the Agoranomi at this period is of course out of the\r\nquestion. For the word ἀσφαλῶς (safely) in the fragment of _Eubulus_,\r\n(Athenaeus bk. XIII. p. 568), where it is said of the brothel-girls:\r\n\r\n  παρ’ ὧν βεβαίως _ἀσφαλῶς_ τ’ ἔξεστί σοι\r\n  μικροῦ πριάσθαι κέρματος τὴν ἡδονήν\r\n\r\n(from whom surely and _safely_ you may buy your pleasure for a small\r\ncoin), admits of an easy explanation, if we consider that these common\r\nwomen are contrasted here not with the hetaerae but with the free women\r\nof the city, illicit intercourse with whom was always dangerous for\r\nthe voluptuary, being punished as rape or adultery. The most telling\r\nproof is afforded by the passage of _Diogenes Laertius_, bk. VI. ch.\r\n4., where he says: “When _Antisthenes_ saw a man accused of adultery,\r\nhe said to him, Unhappy man, what serious risk you might have avoided\r\nfor an obol! (ὦ δυστυχὴς, πηλίκον κίνδυνον ὀβολοῦ διαφυγεῖν εδύνασο).\r\nAlso the passage of _Xenarchus_, (Athenaeus, bk. XIII. p. 569.), is\r\npertinent, where it is said, καὶ τῶν δ’ ἑκάστην ἐστὶν ἀδεῶς, εὐτελῶς,\r\n(and of the women each can be enjoyed without fear, cheaply). Hence too\r\nthe verses of _Menander_ (Lucian, Amor. 33.) should read,\r\n\r\n  καὶ φαρμακεῖαι, καὶ νόσων χαλεπωτάτη\r\n  φθόνος, μεθ’ οὗ ζῇ πάντα τὸν βίον γυνὴ\r\n\r\n(and medicines, and hardest of diseases—envy, wherewith a woman dwells\r\nall her life long) and not, as the received text has it,\r\n\r\n  καὶ φαρμακεῖα, καὶ νόσοι· χαλεπώτατος\r\n  φθόνος.\r\n\r\n(and medicine, and disease; hardest is envy).\r\n\r\n[140] Comp. above p. 70. note 2. _Harpocration_, Lexicon X.\r\nrhetor.—_Eustathius_, Comment. on Homer’s Iliad XIX. 282., p. 1185.,\r\nQuod auro gaudeat Venus, de qua est in fabula, ille quoque manifestum\r\nfacit, qui tradit: Solonem Veneris vulgaris templum dedicasse e\r\nmulierum quaestu, quas coemtas prostituerat in cellis, in adolescentum\r\ngratiam, (That Venus, of whom is question in the tale, rejoices in\r\ngold, is manifest from the historian who relates, how Solon dedicated a\r\ntemple of the Common (Pandemian) Venus from the gains of the women that\r\nhe had bought and established in chambers as prostitutes, to gratify\r\nthe young men).

Septem puellas ab ipsa infantia\r\nemit Nicareta, Charisii Elei liberta, Hippiae coqui eius uxor, gnara\r\net perita perspiciendae venustae parvulorum naturae et eos sollerter\r\neducandi instituendique scia, ut quae artem eam exerceret, atque ex ea\r\nre victum collegisset, filiarum autem eas nomine compellavit, ut quam\r\nmaximas ab iis, qui earum consuetudinem, tanquam ingenuarum appetebant,\r\nmercedes exigeret, posteaquam autem florem aetatis earum magno cum\r\nquaestu prostituit: uno, ut dicam, fasce, corpora etiam earum, cum\r\nseptem essent, vendidit: Antiae, Stratolae, Aristoclae, Metanirae,\r\nPhilae, Isthmiadis et Neaerae. Quam igitur unusquisque earum emerit,\r\net ut ab iis qui eos a Nicareta emerant, libertate donatae sint. (That\r\nNeaera was a foreigner by birth, I will make it my first business to\r\nprove. Seven girls were bought in earliest childhood by Nicareta,\r\nfreed-woman of Charisius of Elis, wife of his cook Nicias,—a knowing\r\nwoman, astute at noting the promise of beauty in children and skilful\r\nin their clever upbringing and instruction, as might be expected of\r\none who practised that art as a profession and had made her living\r\nthereby. Her daughters however she called them, that she might demand\r\nthe greater fees from such as sought to enjoy their favours, as being\r\nfree-born maidens. Then when they had reached the flower of their\r\nage, she prostituted them with great profit to herself, selling their\r\npersons, seven as they were, in one bundle, so to express it,—whose\r\nnames were Antia, Stratole, Aristoclea, Metanira, Phile, Isthmias, and\r\nNeaera. Thus each of them found a purchaser, and on such conditions\r\nthat they were presented with their freedom by the lovers who had\r\nbought them from Nicareta).\r\n\r\n[152] Comp. the list, compiled chiefly from Athenaeus, of the most\r\nrenowned hetaerae in _Musonius Philosophus_, “De luxu Graecorum” ch.\r\nXII. in _Gronovius’_ Thesaurus Antiq.

It may be noted that\r\nscarcely 40 years after the introduction of the Floralia, P. Scipio\r\nAfricanus in his Speech in defence of Tib.

(All these changes, as day by\r\nday the fortune of the State is higher and more prosperous and her\r\nEmpire grows greater, and our conquests extend over Greece and Asia,\r\nlands replete with every allurement of the senses, and we appropriate\r\ntreasures that may well be called royal,—all this I dread the more from\r\nmy fear that such high fortune may rather master us than we master it).\r\nScarcely 10 years later the same author says (bk. XXXIX. 6.): Luxuriae\r\nenim peregrinae origo ab exercitu Asiatico invecta in urbem est. (For\r\nthe beginnings of foreign luxury were brought into the city by the\r\nAsiatic army). _Juvenal_, Sat.

But\r\npre-eminently applicable are the following words (III. 60 sqq.) of the\r\nsame poet:\r\n\r\n      Non possum ferre, Quirites!\r\n  Graecam urbem, quamvis quota portio faecis Achaeae?\r\n  Iam pridem Syrus in Tiberim defluxit Orontes,\r\n  Et linguam et mores et cum tibicine chordas\r\n  Obliquas, nec non gentilia tympana secum\r\n  Vexit et ad Circum iustas prostare puellas.\r\n\r\n(I cannot bear, Quirites, to see Rome a Greek city,—and yet how mere\r\na fraction of the whole corruption is found in these dregs of Achaea?\r\nLong since has the Syrian Orontes flowed into the Tiber, and brought\r\nalong with it the Syrian tongue and manners and cross-stringed harp—and\r\nharper, and exotic timbrels, and girls bidden stand for hire at the\r\nCircus).\r\n\r\n[173] The usual derivation of the word _lupanar_ (brothel) is from\r\nLupa, the wife of Faustulus (_Livy_, I. 4.); thus _Lactantius_, Divin.\r\nInstit., bk. I. 20 sqq., says, fuit enim Faustuli uxor et, propter\r\nvulgati corporis vilitatem, Lupa inter pastores, id est meretrix,\r\nnuncupata est, unde etiam lupanar dicitur. (For she was the wife of\r\nFaustulus, and because of the easy rate at which her person was held at\r\nthe disposal of all, was called among the shepherds Lupa, (she-wolf),\r\nthat is harlot, whence also Lupanar—a brothel—is so called). Comp.\r\n_Isidore_, bk. XVIII. etymol. 42. _Jerome_, in Eusebius’ Chronicle.\r\nHowever it is a fruitless effort to try and connect lupar and lupanar\r\nwith lupus, the wolf. If we are not mistaken, the root-word is the\r\nGreek λῦμα, filth, and so, shameless person; from this comes _lupa_,\r\njust as from λῦμαρ was formed _lupar_, the oldest form for lupanar,\r\nwhich has maintained itself in the adjective _luparius_, and in\r\n_lupariae_ in _Rufus_ and _A. Victor_ as synonyms of lupanar. Indeed\r\n_Lactantius_ speaks of the hetaerae Leaena and Cedrenus as γυναῖκας\r\nλυκαίνας.\r\n\r\n[174] The common derivation of _fornix_ (brothel) is from _furnus_ or\r\nfornax (an oven), or else makes it identical with fornix, an archway.\r\n_Isidore_, bk. X. 110., writes: a _fornicatrix_ is one whose person is\r\npublic and common. These women used to lie under archways, and such\r\nplaces are called _fornices_, whence also _fornicariae_ (whores).\r\nGranted that the women used to resort in numbers to the arches in the\r\ntown-walls through which sorties were made (_Livy_, XXXVI. 23., XLIV.\r\n11.), yet several passages in ancient authors prove clearly that the\r\n_fornices_ were _houses_ (especially _Petronius_, Satir. 7., _Martial_\r\nXI. 62.). The _ancient Glosses_ have:—“fornicaria”: πορνὴ ἀπὸ καμάρας ᾗ\r\nἵστανται, (a harlot, from the chamber where they take their stand). But\r\nin all probability the brothels took their name from the circumstance\r\nof their being situated in the neighbourhood of the town-wall and its\r\narches; for which reason the women were also called _Summoenianae_\r\n(women of the Summoenium,—district under the walls). Martial, XI. 62.,\r\nIII. 82., I. 35., XII. 32. Or should we say that _fornix_ was formed\r\nfrom πορνικὸν?\r\n\r\n[175] _Adler_, “Beschreibung der Stadt Rom,” (Description of the City\r\nof Rome), pp. 144 sqq.\r\n\r\n[176] _Martial_, bk. VII. Epigr. 30., bk. X. Epigr. 94.\r\n\r\n[177] _Martial_, bk. II. Epigr. 17.\r\n\r\n[178] Hence Martial’s expression (XII. 18.), clamosa Subura (the\r\nclamorous Subura).\r\n\r\n[179] Horace, Satir. I. 2. 30., Contra alius nullam nisi olenti in\r\nfornice stantem. (On the other hand another man cares for no woman but\r\nsuch as stand in the foul-smelling brothel).—_Priapeia_,\r\n\r\n  Quilibet huc, licebit, intret\r\n  Nigra fornicis oblitus favilla.\r\n\r\n(All that please, none will say nay, may enter here, smeared with the\r\nblack spot of the brothel).—_Prudentius_, Contra Symmachum, bk. II.,\r\nspurcam redolente fornice cellam, (a filthy chamber in the stinking\r\nbrothel).—_Seneca_, Controv., I. 2., Redoles adhuc fuliginem fornicis.\r\n(You reek still of the soot of the brothel).—_Juvenal_, Sat VI. 130.,\r\nsays of the Empress Messalina:\r\n\r\n  Obscurisque genis turpis, fumoque lucernae\r\n  Foeda lupanaris tulit ad pulvinar odorem.\r\n\r\n(And disfigured and dim-eyed, fouled with the smoke of the lamp, she\r\nbore back the stink of the brothel to the imperial couch).\r\n\r\n[180] _Juvenal_, Sat. VI. 122., 127.—_Petronius_, Sat. 8.—_Lipsius_,\r\nSaturn. I. 14. Hence Cella and Cellae (chambers) are constantly used in\r\nthe sense of lupanar (brothel).\r\n\r\n[181] _Martial_, bk. XI. 46., Intrasti quoties inscripta limina\r\ncellae, (As oft as you have crossed the thresholds of a “chamber”\r\nwith inscription over). _Seneca_, Controv., bk. I. 2., Deducta es\r\nin lupanar, accepisti locum, pretium constitutum est, _titulus_\r\ninscriptus est, (You were taken away to a brothel, you received your\r\nstand, your price was fixed, _your name written up_).—Meretrix vocata\r\nes, in communi loco stetisti, _superpositus est cellae tuae titulus_,\r\nvenientes recepisti, (You were called a harlot, you took your stand in\r\na public brothel, _your name-ticket was put up above your chamber_, you\r\nreceived such as came).—Nomen tuum pedendit in fronte, pretia stupri\r\naccepisti, et manus, quae diis datura erat sacra, capturas tulit,\r\n(Your name hung on your door, you took the price of fornication, and\r\nyour hand, that was meant to offer sacred gifts to the gods, held the\r\nfees). This last passage interpreters have wished to understand as if\r\nthe name-ticket were fastened on the woman’s forehead; but, not to\r\nmention that in this case _tibi_ would have to be read for _tuum_,\r\nit is a perfectly well known fact that _frons_ (front, forehead) was\r\nused in Latin for the face of a door (_Ovid_, Fasti, I. 135., Omnis\r\nhabet geminas, hinc atque hinc, ianua frontes, (Every door has two\r\nfaces, inside and out). _Seneca_ says _pependit_ (it hung there), and\r\nafterwards is promoted onto the list of the Leno (Brothel-keeper)!\r\n\r\n[182] This is seen most clearly from the following passage in the “Vita\r\nApollonii Tyrii”, (Life of Apollonius of Tyre), p. 695., Puella ait,\r\nprosternens se ad pedes eius: miserere, domine, virginitatis meae,\r\nne prostituas hoc corpus sub tam turpi titulo. Leno vocavit villicum\r\npuellarum et ait, ancilla, quae praesens est et exornetur diligenter et\r\nscribatur et titulus, quicunque Tarsiam deviolaverit, mediam liberam\r\ndabit: postea ad singulos solidos populo patebit. (Says the girl,\r\nthrowing herself at his feet: “Sir! have pity on my maidenhood, and do\r\nnot prostitute this fair body under so ugly a name.” The Brothel-keeper\r\n(Leno) called the Superintendent (villicus) of the girls and says,\r\n“Let the maid here present be decked out with every care, and a\r\nname-ticket written for her; the man that takes Tarsia’s virginity\r\nshall pay half a “libera” (?), afterwards she shall be at the disposal\r\nof all comers at a “solidus” or “aureus”, gold coin worth 25 denarii,\r\nsay 20 shillings—each). So we see even in the name there prevailed a\r\ncertain luxury; and a young girl of handsome person would fain have a\r\nhandsome-sounding name to match.\r\n\r\n[183] _Petronius_ Satir. 20.—_Barth_, on Claudian, note\r\n1173.—_Martial_, XIV. 148., 152.—_Juvenal_, VI. 194. From this the\r\nwomen themselves were often called _lodices meretrices_ (blanket\r\nharlots) in contradistinction to the Street-walkers.\r\n\r\n[184] _Martial_, XIV. 39-42. XI. 105.—_Apuleius_, Metam., V.\r\np. 162.—_Horace_, Satir. II. 7. v. 48.—_Juvenal_, Sat.

The\r\nfee amounted usually to an As. _Petronius_, Satir. 8., Iam pro cella\r\nmeretrix assem exegerat, (Already had the harlot demanded the As for\r\nthe chamber). _Martial_, I. 104., Constat et asse Venus, (And an As\r\nis the recognised price of Love).

Vendit pirata, emit leno.—Ita\r\nraptae pepercere piratae, ut lenoni venderetur: sic emit leno, ut\r\nprostituerit. (Naked she stood on the shore at the pleasure of the\r\npurchaser; every part of her body was examined and felt. Would you\r\nhear the result of the sale? The pirate sold, the pandar bought.—For\r\nthis the pirates spared their captive, that she might be sold to a\r\npandar; for this the pandar bought her, that he might employ her as a\r\nprostitute).—_Quintilian_, Declam. III., Leno etiam servis excipitur,\r\nfortasse hac lege captivos vendes, (A pandar too is supplied with\r\nslaves; perhaps in this way you will sell your captives).—Lex § 1. de\r\nin ius vocando: Prostituta contra legem venditionis venditorem habet\r\npatronum, si hac lege venierat, ut, si prostituta esset, fieret libera,\r\n(Law § 1. Of the right of appeal: A female slave prostituted contrary\r\nto the condition of sale has the seller for patron, if she was sold\r\non this condition, that, should she be prostituted, she should become\r\nfree). These sales took place in the Subura. _Martial_, VI. 66.\r\n\r\n[187] _Seneca_, Controv., I. 2., Stetisti cum meretricibus, stetisti\r\nsic ornata ut populo placere posses, _ea veste quam leno dederat_,\r\n(You stood with the harlots, you stood decked out so as to please the\r\npublic, wearing the dress that the leno had given you). The dress of\r\nthe public women was always gay-coloured and very bold; they had to\r\nwear the male toga (gown). _Cicero_, Philipp. II., Sompsisti virilem\r\ntogam, quam statim muliebrem reddidisti. Primo vulgare scortum:\r\ncerta flagitii merces, nec ea parva. (You assumed the man’s toga,\r\nwhich straightway you made a woman’s. First a common strumpet; sure\r\nwas the profit of your shame, and not small either.)—_Tibullus_, IV.\r\n10. _Martial_, II. 30. Hence public women were also called _togatae_\r\n(wearing the toga or man’s gown). _Martial_, VI. 64. _Horace_, Sat I.\r\n2. 63., Quid interest in matrona, ancilla, peccesque togata? (What\r\ndifference does it make whether it is with a married woman, or a\r\nserving-maid, or a toga’d harlot (togata), that you offend?) Ibidem\r\n80-83.,\r\n\r\n  Nec magis huic inter niveos viridesque lapillos\r\n  (_Sit licet hoc, Cerinthe, tuum_,) tenerum est femur aut crus\r\n  Rectius; atque etiam melius persaepe _togatae est_.\r\n\r\n(Nor amidst all her showy gems and green jewels is her thigh more\r\nsoft (though it is your belief, Cerinthus, that it is) or her leg\r\nstraighter; nay! very often that of the toga’d harlot is the better\r\nlimb).\r\n\r\nIt is well-known what trouble _Bentley_ gave himself to explain this\r\n_locus implicatissimus_ (most intricate passage), as he calls it,\r\nbecause he supposed the common reading to be corrupt and accordingly\r\naltered the text, all to bring out a comparison of Cerinthus’ thigh—a\r\ncomparison that never was in Horace’s mind at all. Several years ago in\r\nour Work, “De Sexuali Organismorum Fabrica,” (On the Sexual Fabric of\r\nOrganisms), Spec. I., Halle 1832. large 8vo., p. 61., we disentangled\r\nthe matter and showed exactly how it stood, proving that the “Sit licet\r\nhoc, Cerinthe, tuum” (Though this be your (opinion), Cerinthus) must\r\nbe taken as a parenthesis, consequently that the usual reading is the\r\nright one. But as the book would seem to have come into few hands, and\r\nleast of all into those of Philologists, we may be allowed to take this\r\nopportunity of once more developing our view. The comparison is between\r\nthe matron and the “togata”, and it is maintained that the matron,\r\ni. e. the noble Roman lady, possesses for all her jewelry neither a\r\nsofter thigh nor a straighter leg than the “togata”, the girl of common\r\nstamp; that the latter in fact can often make a better show of both,\r\neven though her leg is as crooked as the matron’s is,—a peculiarity\r\nthat _every_ female leg has, because in a woman the knee projects more\r\nforwards. _Aristotle_, Hist. Anim., IV. 11. 6., even in his time notes\r\nthis fact: τὸ θῆλυ τῶν ἀῤῥένων καὶ γονυκροτώτερον. (the female is more\r\nknock-kneed also than the male). Comp. same author’s Physiognom., 3. 5.\r\n6. _Adamant._, Physiognom., II. 107. ed. Sylb. _Polemo_, Physiognom.,\r\np. 179. Anatomical investigation moreover proves this most clearly.\r\nBut as Cerinthus seems to be ignorant of it, in spite of its being a\r\nwell known Act, he lets himself be deluded by the outward magnificence\r\nof attire and distinguished birth, and believes the matron to be the\r\nbetter built, and it is for this mistake the poet taunts him. Horace in\r\nthis passage is merely giving a commentary on v. 63 above. Now compare\r\nwhat _Plautus_, Mostell., I. 3. 13, makes Scopha say to Philemation,\r\nNon vestem amatores mulieris amant, sed vestis fartum (’Tis not the\r\ndress of a woman that lovers love, but the _lining_ of the dress);\r\nalso _Martial_, III. Epigr. 33.; and the folly of _Cerinthus_ is made\r\nquite obvious. The phrase—Sit licet hoc tuum (Though this be yours)\r\nin the sense, “though you look at it this way, take the dazzle of\r\njewels as the criterion of a woman’s beauty”, surely needs no further\r\nconfirmation.\r\n\r\n[188] _Seneca_, Controv., I. 2., Da mihi lenonis rationes; captura\r\nconveniet. (Give me the brothel-keeper’s accounts; the fee will suit).\r\n\r\n[189] _Seneca_, Controv., I. 2., Deducta es in lupanar, accepisti\r\nlocum, _pretium constitutum est_. (You were taken to a brothel, you\r\ntook your place, your price was fixed). _Ovid_, Amores, I. 10., Stat\r\nmeretrix cuivis _certo_ mercabilis aere. (There stands the harlot\r\nthat any man can buy for a _fixed_ sum). The fee was called _captura_\r\n(fee) (compare _Schulting_, on Seneca, loco citato, and _Casaubon_\r\non Suetonius, Caligula 40.), _quaestus meretricius_ (harlot’s hire)\r\n(_Cicero_, Philipp. II. 18.) or simply _quaestus_ (hire); _merces_\r\n(cost) and _pretium stupri_ (price of fornication); _aurum lustrale_\r\n(brothel, literally _den_, money). The women used to demand its\r\npayment. _Juvenal_, Sat. VI. 125. Excepit blanda intrantes atque aera\r\npoposcit. (Blandly she welcomed her visitors as they entered and asked\r\nfor the fee). Hence the expression “basia meretricum poscinummia”\r\n(harlots kisses that ask for money) in _Apuleius_, Met., X. p. 248.\r\nFor the rest prices were very various among the brothel-harlots as\r\nthey were with the others. Comp. _Martial_, X. 75., IX. 33., III. 54.\r\nThe lowest fee was one As or 2 obols (three pence); hence girls of the\r\nsort were called by the Romans also _diobolares meretrices_ (two-obol\r\nharlots) (Festus) or _diobolaria scorta_ (two-obol whores) (_Plautus_,\r\nPoen., I. 2. 58.). Comp. p. 90 above.\r\n\r\n[190] _Plautus_, Trinum., IV. 2. 47., Quae adversum legem accepisti a\r\nplurimis pecuniam. (You who contrary to the regulation accepted money\r\nfrom a great many men).\r\n\r\n[191] Hence the women were also called _Nonariae_ (Ninth-hour women).\r\n_Persius_, Sat. I. 133. The Scholiast observes on the passage: Nonaria\r\ndicta meretrix, quia apud veteres a nona hora prostabant, ne mane\r\nomissa exercitatione illo irent adolescentes. (A harlot was called\r\n“Nonaria”, because in former times they used to act as prostitutes from\r\nthe ninth hour only, for fear the young men should resort thither in\r\nthe morning to the neglect of their athletic exercises).\r\n\r\n[192] _Nonius Marcellus_, V. § 8., Inter _meretricem_ et _prostibulum_\r\nhoc interest: quod meretrix honestioris loci est et quaestus: nam\r\n_meretrices_ a merendo dictae sunt, quod copiam sui tantummodo noctu\r\nfacerent: _prostibula_, quod ante stabulum stent quaestus diurni\r\net nocturni causa. (This is the difference between a _meretrix_\r\n(harlot) and a _prostibulum_ (common strumpet): a meretrix is of a\r\nmore honorable station and calling; for _meretrices_ were so named\r\na _merendo_ (from earning wages), because they plied their calling\r\nonly by night; _prostibula_, because they stand before the _stabulum_\r\n(stall, “chamber”) for gain both by day and night).—_Plautus_, Cistell.\r\nfragm., Adstat ea in via sola: prostibula sane est. (She stands there\r\nin the way alone: surely she is a _prostibula_—common whore).\r\n\r\n[193] _Plautus_, Poenul., I. 2. 54.,\r\n\r\n  An te ibi vis inter istas vorsarier\r\n  _Prosedas_, pistorum amicas, reliquias alicarias,\r\n  Miseras coeno delibutas, servilicolas, sordidas,\r\n  Quae tibi olent stabulum, statumque, sellam et sessibulum merum,\r\n  Quas adeo haud quisquam tetigit, neque duxit domum?\r\n\r\n(It is your wish to pass your time there amongst those _common\r\nstrumpets_, bakers’ mistresses, refuse of the spelt-mill girls, drabs\r\nbesmeared with filth, slaves’ darlings, squalid creatures that reek of\r\ntheir stand and trade, of the chair and bare stool, women that no free\r\nman ever touched or took home?) This serves also to explain the passage\r\nin _Juvenal_, III. 136., Et dubitas alta Chionem deducere sella. (And\r\nyou hesitate to hand down Chione from her high seat).\r\n\r\n[194] _Martial_, XI. 45., I. 35. Usually however this appears only to\r\nhave been done, when the customer was gratifying unnatural lusts.\r\n\r\n[195] _Plautus_, Asin., IV. 1. 19., In foribus scribat, occupatam esse\r\nse. (Let her write on the door that she is engaged).\r\n\r\n[196] _Martial_, XI. 62.,\r\n\r\n  Quem cum fenestra vidit a Suburana\r\n  Obscoena _nudum_ lena _fornicem_ clausit.\r\n\r\n(When she saw him from a window in the Subura, the foul\r\nbrothel-mistress shut the _unoccupied “chamber”_).\r\n\r\n_Juvenal_, VI. 121.,\r\n\r\n  Intravit calidum veteri centone lupanar,\r\n  Et cellam _vacuam_ atque suam.\r\n\r\n(She entered the brothel cosy with its old patch-work quilt, and the\r\nchamber that was _vacant_ and her own.). Messalina had hired, we see, a\r\nspecial “chamber” of her own, where she acted as a prostitute under the\r\nname of Lycisca.\r\n\r\n[197] Juvenal, VI. 127.,\r\n\r\n  Mox, lenone suas iam dimittente puellas,\r\n  Tristis abit—tamen ultima cellam clausit.\r\n\r\n(Presently when time is up and the brothel-keeper dismisses his girls,\r\nsadly she takes her departure,—but she was the last to shut her\r\nchamber).\r\n\r\n[198] III. 65., et _ad circum_ iussas prostare puellas (and girls\r\nbidden stand for hire _at the Circus_).\r\n\r\n[199] Of Heliogabalus _Lampridius_, (Vita Heliog. ch. 26.)\r\nrelates: Omnes de _circo_, de theatro, de stadio—meretrices\r\ncollegit. (He collected all the harlots,—from _circus_, theatre and\r\nstadium—race-course). An old poem (_Priapeia_, carm. 26,) says:\r\n\r\n  Deliciae populi, _magno_ notissima _circo_\r\n  Quintia.\r\n\r\n(The darling of the people, Quintia, so well known _in the Great\r\nCircus_). Comp. _Buleng._ De Circo ch. 56. Supposing this view to be\r\ncorrect, we might read in the passage of _Juvenal_, III. 136., as\r\nseveral Critics do, “alta Chionem deducere _cella_” (to lead Chione\r\ndown from her lofty “chamber”).\r\n\r\n[200] Already in _Livy_, II. 18., we read the account: Eo anno Romae,\r\ncum per ludos ab Sabinorum iuventute per lasciviam scorta raperentur,\r\netc. (That year at Rome, when during the games harlots were carried\r\noff in their wantonness by the youth of the Sabines, etc.) _Plautus_,\r\nCasin. Prolog., 82-86.; this passage is repeatedly cited in this\r\nconnection, but really has only a remote bearing on the matter. But\r\nin confirmation _Isidore_, XVIII. 42., says: Idem vero theatrum\r\nidem et prostibulum, eo quod _post ludos exactos meretrices ibi\r\nprosternerentur_. (But theatre and brothel were identical, for _after\r\nthe games were over, harlots used to prostitute themselves there_).\r\nComp. _Buleng._ De Theatro I. 16. and 49. _Lipsius_, Elect., I. 11.\r\nOf course these statements may refer equally well to the Floralia or,\r\nas _Isidore_ lived so much later, to the lascivious representations\r\nof brothel-life of which _Tertullian_ tells us. The latter writes,\r\nDe Spectaculis ch. 17., Ipsa etiam prostibula, publicae libidinis\r\nhostiae, in scena proferantur, plus miserae in praesentia feminarum,\r\nquibus solis latebant: perque omnis aetatis, omnis dignitatis ora\r\ntransducuntur, locus, stipes, elogium, etiam quibus opus est,\r\npraedicatur. (Nay, the very harlots, victims of the public lust, are\r\nbrought forward on the stage, more wretched still in the presence of\r\nwomen, who alone used to be ignorant of such things; and they are\r\ndiscussed by the lips of every age and every condition, and place,\r\norigin, merits, even what should never be mentioned, are freely spoken\r\nof). In 1791 in a public theatre in Paris just such things were\r\nrepresented as _Juvenal_ in his Sixth Satire speaks of as being acted\r\nat Rome. Gynaeology Pt. III. p. 423. That whores were to be found in\r\nthe Theatre as well as in the Circus is shown by _Lampridius_, Vita\r\nHeliogab., ch. 32., fertur et una die ad omnes _circi_ et _theatri_ et\r\n_amphitheatri_ et omnium urbis locorum _meretrices_ ingressus. (And\r\naccess is given on one day to all the _harlots of circus, theatre\r\nand amphitheatre_ and all the places of the city). Comp. ch. 26.,\r\nand _Abram._ on Cicero’s Speech for Milo ch. 24. p. 177. Perhaps at\r\nall these spots “chambers” (cellae) were put up, to which the word\r\n_locorum_ (places) above may very well refer.\r\n\r\n[201] _Horace_, Epist.

(Now Dorotheus the Physician says in his\r\nMemoirs, that at Alexandria in Egypt a _cinaedus_ brought forth; and\r\nthat the babe was mummified and kept as a curiosity). The same thing\r\nis reported in the following chapter of a slave with the Roman army in\r\nGermany under the command of T. Curtilius Mancias. These stories may\r\npossibly borrow some probability from modern investigations as to the\r\n“foetus” within the “foetus”. The expression “to sow seed on barren\r\nrocks” occurs, it may be mentioned, very frequently in connection with\r\npaederastia in the Fathers.\r\n\r\n[239] _Juvenal_, Sat. VI. 366 sqq.,\r\n\r\n  Sunt quas eunuchi imbelles ac mollia semper\r\n  Oscula delectent et desperatio barbae.\r\n  _Et quod abortivo non est opus_, illa voluptas\r\n  Summa tamen, quod iam calida matura iuventa\r\n  Inguina traduntur medicis, iam pectine nigro.\r\n  Ergo exspectatos ac iussos crescere primum,\r\n  Testiculos, postquam coeperunt esse bilibres,\r\n  Tonsoris damno tantum rapit Heliodorus.\r\n\r\n(Women there are to find delight in unwarlike eunuchs and kisses ever\r\nsoft and the lack of a beard that can never grow, and this especially\r\nbecause then there is no need for any abortive. But the pleasure is\r\ngreatest when the organs are delivered full-grown to the surgeons,\r\njust in the heat of youth, just when the down of puberty is darkening.\r\nThen when the testicles, long looked for and at first encouraged to\r\ngrow, begin to be of double balanced weight, lo! Heliodorus whips them\r\noff,—to the barber’s loss).\r\n\r\n_Martial_, VI. 67.,\r\n\r\n  Cur tantum Eunuchos habeat tua Gellia, quaeris\r\n  Pannice? vult futui Gellia, non parere.\r\n\r\n(Why your Gellia is fain to have eunuchs only, do you ask, Pannicus?\r\nBecause she wishes to be f-ck-d, not to be a mother). In longam\r\nsecuramque libidinem exsectus spado, (A eunuch castrated with a view to\r\nlong-continued and _harmless_ lust), says St. Jerome. The information\r\ngiven by _Galen_ (De usu Partium bk. XIV. 15. edit. Kühn, vol. IV.\r\np. 571) is notable, to the effect that the athletes at Olympia were\r\ncastrated, that their strength might not be wasted by coition. Have\r\nthe words “Olimpia agona” (Olimpic—Olympic—games) been in some way\r\nmisunderstood in the passage?\r\n\r\n[240] Genesis XIX. 4., Levit., XVIII. 2., XXIX. 13.\r\n\r\n[241] _Welcker_, Aeschylus—Trilogy, p. 356.\r\n\r\n[242] _Athenaeus_, Deipnosoph., p. 602., τοῦ παιδεραστεῖν παρὰ πρώτων\r\nΚρητῶν εἰς τοὺς Ἕλληνας παρελθόντος, ὡς ἱστορεῖ Τίμαιος. (The practice\r\nof paederastia having been introduced among the Greeks first by the\r\nCretans, as Timaeus relates).—_Heraclitus Ponticus_, fragment, περὶ\r\nπολιτείας III. p. 7.—_Servius_ on Virgil—Aeneid bk. X. 325., de\r\nCretensibus accepimus, quod in amore puerorum intemperantes fuerunt,\r\nquod postea in Laconas et totam Graeciam translatum est. (Of the\r\nCretans we have been told that they were excessive in their love of\r\nboys, a practice afterwards imported into Laconia and all parts of\r\nGreece.) Comp. _K. O. Müller_, “Die Dorier”, (The Dorians), Vol. II.\r\npp. 240 sqq. K. Höck, “Kreta”, (Crete), Vol. III. p. 106. Though in\r\nCrete as in all Dorian States Paedophilia was a universal and official\r\ninstitution, yet paederastia too was common enough, as is shown by\r\nthe censure expressed by _Plato_ (De Legibus bk. I. 636., bk. VII.\r\n836.) and _Plutarch_, (De puerorum educatione ch. 14.).—as also by the\r\nexpression Κρῆτα τρόπον (Cretan fashion) given in _Hesychius_; and\r\nprobably the word κρητίζειν (to play the Cretan) is to be understood\r\nfrom this point of view also. _Pfeffinger_, “De Cretum vitiis,” (Of the\r\nVices of the Cretans). Strasbourg 1701. 4to. From this _Aristotle_\r\n(Politics II. 7. 5.) may have got the idea that the lawgiver in Crete\r\nintroduced paederastia in order to check the increase of population.\r\n_Hesychius_ says at any rate κρῆτα τρόπον, παιδικοῖς χρῆσθαι. (Cretan\r\nfashion, i.e. to indulge in boy-loves). Of the Scythians later on.\r\n\r\n[243] Thus _Plutarch_, Eroticus, ch. 5., Ἡ δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀῤῥένων ἀκόντων,\r\nμετὰ βίας γενομένη καὶ λεηλασίας, ἂν δὲ ἑκουσίως, σὺν μαλακίᾳ καὶ\r\nθηλύτητι _βαίνεσθαι_ κατὰ Πλάτωνα _νόμῳ τετράποδος καὶ παιδοσπορεῖσθαι\r\nπαρὰ φύσιν_ ἐνδιδόντων, χάρις ἄχαρις παντάπασι καὶ ἀσχήμων καὶ\r\n_ἀναφρόδιτος_. (But the pleasure that is won from males against their\r\nwill by dint of force or robbery, or if voluntarily, then only because\r\nin their wantonness and effeminacy they consent to men _treading\r\nthem_, as Plato puts it, _like a four-footed beast_, and emitting seed\r\nwith them unnaturally—this pleasure is a _graceless_ one altogether,\r\nand unseemly and _loveless_). The passage of Plato referred to here\r\nis in the Phaedrus, p. 250 E., ὥστε οὐ σέβεται προσορῶν, ἀλλ’ ἡδονῇ\r\nπαραδοὺς _τετράποδος νόμον βαίνειν_ ἐπιχειρεῖ καὶ παιδοσπορεῖν, καὶ\r\nὕβρει προσομιλῶν οὐ δέδοικεν οὐδ’ αἰσχύνεται παρὰ φύσιν ἡδονὴν διώκων.\r\n(And so he feels no reverence when he looks on him, but giving way to\r\npleasure endeavours to _tread like a four-footed beast_ and to emit his\r\nseed, and using insolent violence in his intercourse, has no fear and\r\nno shame in pursuing pleasure in an unnatural way). As something παρὰ\r\nφύσιν (contrary to nature) we find paederastia further characterized\r\nin _Athenaeus_, Deipnosoph., bk. XIII. p. 605. _Lucian_, Amores, 19.\r\n_Philo_, De legg. spec., II. p. 306. 17. _Libanius_, Orat., XIX. p.\r\n500. ἡ παράνομος Ἀφροδίτη.

Vol. V. p. 30. τῆς παρὰ φύσιν αἰσχρουργίας (of\r\nunnatural viciousness). In the _Anthologia Graeca_, bk. II. tit. 5. No.\r\n10. is the distich following by an unknown author:\r\n\r\n  Υἱὸς Πατρικίου μάλα κόσμιος, _ὃς διὰ Κύπριν\r\n  Οὐχ ὁσίην_ ἑτάρους πάντας _ἀποστρέφεται_.\r\n\r\n(Son of Patricius, a very discreet man, who by _unholy love seduces_\r\nall his comrades). But above all the passage in _Aeschines_,\r\nOrat. in Timarch. edit. Reiske, p. 146., is to the point in this\r\nconnection: ὁρίζομαι δ’ εἶναι, τὸ μὲν ἐρᾶν τῶν καλῶν καὶ σωφρόνων,\r\nφιλανθρώπου, πάθος καὶ εὐγνώμονος ψυχῆς· τὸ δὲ ἀσελγαίνειν ἀργυρίου\r\nτινὰ μισθούμενον, ὑβριστοῦ καὶ ἀπαιδεύτου ἀνδρὸς ἔργον εἶναι ἡγοῦμαι·\r\nκαὶ τὸ μὲν ἀδιαφθόρως ἐρᾶσθαι, φημὶ καλὸν εἶναι· τὸ δὲ ἐπαρθέντα\r\nμισθῷ πεπορνεῦσθαι, αἰσχρόν. (Now I make this distinction, that to\r\nlove honourable and prudent friends is the passion of an amiable and\r\nreasonable soul; whereas to behave licentiously, hiring anyone for\r\nthe purpose, I consider the act of a ruffianly and uncultivated man.\r\nSimilarly, to be loved purely, I declare to be a noble thing; but,\r\ninduced by pay, to allow oneself to be debauched, a foul thing). Anyone\r\nwho has read this passage attentively, together with what follows\r\nin the Speech, cannot possibly any longer confound Paedophilia with\r\nPaederastia, or maintain that the latter was approved by the Greeks.\r\n\r\n[244] _Aelian_, Var.

(A witty but\r\nsuperficial critic considered the opinion of the president Bouhier to\r\nbe self-contradictory.

The Scholiast on _Lucian_, Amores ch. 2.,\r\nwrites Ἐπεὶ καὶ ταῖς Λημνίαις γυναιξὶν ἔγκοτος Ἀφροδίτη γενομένη,\r\nεἶτα _δυσώδεις αὐτὰς ποιήσασα, ἀποκοίτους αὐτὰς ποιῆσαι τοὺς ἄνδρας\r\nαὐτῶν ἠνάγκασεν_. (When Aphrodité, angered with the women of Lemnos,\r\nhad then _made them malodorous, and so compelled their husbands to\r\nexpel them from their beds_). Similarly the Scholiast on _Apollonius\r\nRhodius_, Argonaut., I. 609., αἱ Λήμνιαι γυναῖκες ... τῶν τῆς Ἀφροδίτης\r\nτιμῶν κατολιγωρήσασαι, καθ’ ἑαυτῶν τὴν θεὸν ἐκίνησαν· _πάσαις γάρ\r\nδυσοσμίαν ἐνέβαλεν, ὡς μηκέτι αὐτὰς τοῖς ἀνδράσιν ἀρέσκειν_. (The\r\nLemnian women, by neglecting the honours due to Aphrodité, stirred\r\nthe goddess’ anger against them. For _she inflicted on them all an\r\nill-odour, so that they were no longer pleasing to their husbands_).\r\nTo the same purport the Scholiast on _Euripides_, Hecuba v. 887., who\r\ncites Didymus as authority: Ἐν Λήμνῳ γυναῖκες ἐτέλουν ἐτήσιον ἑορτὴν\r\nἈφροδίτῃ· ἐπεὶ οὖν ποτε καταφρονήσασαι τῆς θεοῦ, ἀπέλιπον τὸ ἔθος, _ἡ\r\nἈφροδίτη ἐνέβαλεν αὐταῖς δυσωδίαν, ὡς μὴ δύνασθαι τοὺς ἑαυτῶν ἄνδρας\r\nαὐταῖς πλησιάσαι_· αἱ δὲ νομίσασαι, ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνδρῶν καταφρονεῖσθαι,\r\nτούτους πάντας ἀπέκτειναν. ὁ δέ Δίδυμος οὕτω. (At Lemnos the women used\r\nto celebrate a yearly festival in honour of Aphrodité. And so when\r\non one occasion they scorned the goddess and neglected the custom,\r\nAphrodité afflicted them with an ill odour, so that their own husbands\r\ncould not come near them. And they concluding they were scorned by\r\ntheir husbands, killed them all. Didymus confirms this). The Lesbian\r\n_Myrtilus_ or _Myrsilus_ gives a different account of the origin of\r\nthe evil smell of the Lesbian women, representing it in the First Book\r\nof his “Lesbica” as a consequence of the magic arts of Medea, who had\r\nlanded with Jason at Lemnos. The story was taken from the lost Work of\r\nMyrtilus by _Antigonus Carystius_, Histor. mirab. collect., edit. J.\r\nMeursius. Leyden 1629. 4to., ch. 130. p. 97., Τὰς δέ Λημνίας δυσόσμους\r\nγενέσθαι, Μηδείας ἀφικομένης μετ’ Ἰάσονος καὶ φάρμακα ἐμβαλλούσης εἰς\r\nτὴν νῆσον· κατὰ δέ τινα χρόνον καὶ μάλιστα ἐν ταύταις ταῖς ἡμέραις, ἐν\r\nαἷς ἱστοροῦσι τὴν Μήδειαν παραγενέσθαι, δυσώδεις αὐτὰς οὕτως γίνεσθαι\r\nὥστε μηδένα προσϊέναι. (And that the Lemnian women became malodorous,\r\nwhen Medea came thither with Jason and cast poisonous drugs on the\r\nisland; and that for some length of time and particularly in those days\r\nwhen Medea is related to have been there, they were so ill-smelling\r\nthat no man could approach them.) Also the Scholiast on _Apollonius\r\nRhodius_, I. 165., says: τῶν ἄλλων ἱστορούντων, ὅτι κατὰ χόλον τῆς\r\nἈφροδίτης αἱ Λημνιάδες δύσοσμοι ἐγένοντο, Μυρτίλος ἐν πρώτῳ Λεσβικῶν\r\nδιαφέρεται· καὶ φησὶ τὴν Μήδειαν παραπλέουσαν, διὰ ζηλοτυπίαν ῥίψαι\r\nεἰς τὴν Λήμνον φάρμακον, καὶ δυσοσμίαν γενέσθαι ταῖς γυναιξίν, εἶναί\r\nτε μέχρι τοῦ νῦν κατ’ ἐνιαυτὸν ἡμέραν τινὰ, ἐν ᾗ διὰ τὴν δυσωδίαν\r\nἀποστρέφονται τὰς γυναῖκας ἄνδρές τε καὶ υἱεῖς. (Whereas others relate\r\nthat in consequence of the anger of Aphrodité the women of Lemnos\r\nbecame evil-smelling, Myrtilus in the first Book of the “Lesbica”\r\ntells a different tale. He says that Medea, sailing past the land,\r\nmoved by envy cast a poison on the island, and so an ill odour fell on\r\nthe women; further that there is down to the present time a day once\r\na year, on which owing to this foul odour husbands and sons turn and\r\nflee from the women.) Finally there is an Epigram of _Lucillius_ in the\r\n_Greek Anthology_ (edit. H. de Bosch, Vol. I. p. 416.) Bk. II. Tit. 14.\r\nno. 4., mentioning the evil smell of the Lemnian women:\r\n\r\n  Οὔτε Χίμαιρα τοιοῦτον _ἔπνει_ κακὸν, ἡ καθ’ Ὅμηρον,\r\n  Οὐκ ἀγέλη ταύρων (ὡς ὁ λόγος) πυρίπνους,\r\n  _Οὐ Λῆμνος σύμπασ’_, οὐχ Ἁρπυιῶν τὰ περισσὰ,\r\n  Οὐδ’ ὁ Φιλοκτήτου ποὺς ἀποσηπόμενος,\r\n  Ὥστε σε παμψηφεὶ νικᾶν, Τελέσιλλα, Χιμαίρας,\r\n  Σηπεδόνας, ταύρους, ὄρνεα, _Λημνιάδας_.\r\n\r\n(Neither the Chimaera of Homer had so ill a smell, nor yet the herd\r\n(as the story goes) of fire-breathing bulls, not _all Lemnos_, not\r\nthe foulest of the Harpies, nor even Philoctetes’ putrefying foot.\r\nSo you see, Telesilla, you outdo—the vote is unanimous,—Chimaeras,\r\nputrefactions, bulls, birds, _Lemnian women_!) The stench of Telesilla\r\noutdid, we see, all known evil smells, even that of the Lemnian women,\r\netc. Also in _Valerius Flaccus_, bk. II. 99-241., is found this myth\r\nof the Lemnian women.\r\n\r\n[311] Hence Iphis, in _Ovid_, Metam., IX. 723 sqq., says:\r\n\r\n  Iphis amat, qua posse frui desperat, et auget\r\n  Hoc ipsum flammas: ardetque in virgine virgo.\r\n  Vix tenens lacrimas: Quis me manet exitus, inquit,\r\n  Cognita quam nulli, quam prodigiosa novaeque\r\n  Cura tenet Veneris? si dii mihi parcere vellent.\r\n  _Naturale malum_ saltem et de _more_ dedissent.\r\n  Nec vaccam vaccae, nec equas amor urit equarum.\r\n  Femina femineo correpta cupidine nulla est.\r\n  Vellem nulla forem.\r\n\r\n(Iphis loves one that she knows, alas! she can never enjoy, and this\r\nfact itself increases her passion. A maiden burns for a maiden. Hardly\r\nkeeping back her tears she cries: What fate awaits me,—me who suffer\r\nsorrow of Venus known to none, a sorrow monstrous and of strange new\r\nsort? If the gods were willing to spare me, they would have given me a\r\n_natural_ curse surely, one _of ordinary kind_. No cow burns for a cow,\r\nno mare for the love of mares, nor any woman is taken with love for a\r\nwoman. Would I were no woman!)\r\n\r\nSimilarly _Lucillius_ says of the paederast Cratippus in the Greek\r\nAnthology, bk. II. Tit. V. no. 1.;\r\n\r\n  Τὸν φιλόοπαιδα Κράτιππον ἀκούσατε· θαῦμα γὰρ ὑμῖν\r\n    Καινὸν ἀπαγγέλλω· _πλὴν μεγάλαι νεμέσεις_·\r\n  Τὸν φιλόπαιδα Κράτιππον ἀνεύρομεν ἄλλο γένος· τί;\r\n    Τῶν ἑτεροζήλων ἤλπισα τοῦτ’ ἂν ἐγὼ;\r\n  Ἤλπισα τοῦτο, Κράτιππε; μανήσομαι, εἰ λύκος εἶναι\r\n    Πᾶσι λέγων ἐφάνης ἐξαπίνης ἔριφος.\r\n\r\n(Of the boy-loving Cratippus will I tell you; for a strange new wonder\r\nI report. _Yea! great are the penalties he pays._ The boy-loving\r\nCratippus we have found has another character. What character? I should\r\nhave thought him to be of those whose love is eager on one side only.\r\nDid I think so, Cratippus? Well, I shall seem a madman, if—professing\r\nthe while to all to be a wolf,—you of a sudden appear in the character\r\nof a kid).\r\n\r\nBut most important in this connection is the passage of _Aeschines_,\r\nOrat. in Timarch., p. 178., μὴ γὰρ οἴεσθαι, ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, τὰς τῶν\r\nἀτυχημάτων ἀρχὰς ἀπὸ θεῶν, ἀλλ’ οὐχ ὑπ’ ἀνθρώπων ἀσελγείας γίνεσθαι,\r\nμηδὲ τοὺς ἠσεβηκότας, καθάπερ ἐπὶ ταῖς τραγῳδίαισι, Ποινὰς ἐλαύνειν\r\nκαὶ κολάζειν δᾳσὶν ἡμμέναις· ἀλλ’ αἱ προπετεῖς τοῦ σώματος ἡδοναὶ, καὶ\r\nτὸ μηδὲν ἱκανὸν ἡγεῖσθαι. (For you must not dream, Athenians, that the\r\ncauses of calamities are from the gods, and that such are not rather\r\ndue to the wickedness of mankind. Do not imagine the impious are\r\ndriven by Furies, as is represented in the Tragedies, and chastised\r\nwith blazing torches; nay! it is reckless indulgence in bodily\r\npleasures that is the scourge, and immoderate desires). Comp. _Theon_,\r\nProgymn., ch. 7.—_Cicero_, Orat. in Pison., 20., Nolite putare, Patres\r\nConscripti, ut in scena videtis homines consceleratos impulso deorum\r\nterreri Furiarum taedis ardentibus. Sua quemque fraus, suum facinus,\r\nsuum scelus, sua audacia de sanitate ac mente deturbat. Hae sunt\r\nimpiorum Furiae, hae flammae, hae faces. (Dream not, Conscript Fathers,\r\nthat wicked men, as you see represented on the stage, are driven in\r\nterror, at the instigation of the gods, by the blazing torches of the\r\nFuries. ’Tis his own dishonesty, his own wickedness, his own baseness,\r\nhis own recklessness, that destroys each man’s health and sanity. These\r\nare the furies that torment the impious, these the flames and torches).\r\n\r\n[312] De Bello Peloponnesiaco, Bk. I. ch. 12. (edit. Bauer.

(for translation see text\r\nabove.) The word ἔρις—strife, in this passage is obviously corrupt,\r\nhaving got into the text probably by confusion with ἐρεθίσαι—to\r\nprovoke, standing just below in the MS. _Jacobs_ proposed ἔρνος—scion,\r\nbut according to _Lehmann_ this is too poetical a word for _Lucian_;\r\nἐρεὺς—in the sense of _heir_, might very well be read, giving the\r\nsame meaning. Could ὕβριν—insolence, have been the original word in\r\nthe text? Lucian must have written the passage with a reference to\r\nthe above mentioned punishment of the Lemnian women by Venus, and\r\nby Λημνιάδων—Lemnian women, we must understand not the descendants\r\nof the women of Lemnos, but these women themselves, _Apollonius\r\nRhodius_ (Argon., I. 653.) also using Λημνιάδες δὲ γυναῖκες—Lemnian\r\nwomen, of these same inhabitants of the island. Now the Greeks\r\ncharacterized every form of behaviour of a kind to incur the anger\r\nof the goddess by the word ὕβρις—overbearing insolence; and this\r\nwould exactly fit in the passage, for the οὐδὲ ... οὐδὲ—neither ...\r\nnor, calls for a correspondence of phrase in each clause, and ὕβρις\r\nand ἀγροικία—brutal insensibility, tally excellently. For ὕβρις in\r\nthe sense indicated comp. _Clement of Alexandria_, Paedag., Bk. II.\r\nch. 10., ἐπιθυμία γὰρ κακὴ ὄνομα ὕβρις, καὶ τὸν τῆς ἐπιθυμίας ἵππον,\r\nὑβριστὴν ὁ Πλάτων (Phaedr. pp. 1226, 27.) προσεῖπεν, Ἵπποι θηλυμανεῖς\r\nἐγενήθητέ μοι, ἀναγνούς. (for evil concupiscence is called ὕβρις,\r\nand the horse of concupiscence Plato named Ὑβριστὴς—Overbearing,\r\nhaving read “Wild horses ye became to me.”) We should then have to\r\ntranslate, supposing we read ὕβριν in the text, “I am neither puffed\r\nup with the insolence of the women of Lemnos, nor yet with the brutal\r\ninsensibility of Hippolytus.” Very possibly an Attic writer would not\r\nhave expressed himself so; but we must remember that _Fr. Jacobs_, a\r\nman of fine discrimination of Classical diction, denied from the first\r\nLucian’s authorship of the passage _ob orationem difficilem valdeque\r\nimpeditam_—because of its difficult and exceedingly awkward style. The\r\nunfavourable judgement which _Lehmann_ in his edition passes on this\r\nWork (Lucian’s Amores) so far as its general tenor is concerned, is\r\nbased we may observe almost entirely on the confusion of paedophilia\r\nwith paederastia. However under no circumstances has any actual\r\nallusion been made to the lewdness of the Lemnian women, if _Belin_,\r\n_de Ballu_, and others agree in this rendering.\r\n\r\n[320] De special legib., Opera Vol. II. p. 304.\r\n\r\n[321] _Ovid_, Metamorphos., bk.

But we must beware of connecting the word\r\nλεσβιάζειν (the act the Lesbian) with this; it means something quite\r\ndifferent, as we shall see later on. The Milesian women were skilled\r\n_Tribades_, employing an artificial penis made of leather, which was\r\ncalled by the Greeks ὄλισβος.

They were used by widows\r\nalso.—under the word μισήτης (lewd person): and lewd women will use the\r\n_olisbos_.) Comp. the Scholiast to the passage of Aristophanes quoted.\r\nThere were also cakes shaped like an _olisbos_ and called ὀλισβόκολλοξ\r\n(_olisbos_-loaves)—_Hesychius_, which remind us of the cakes in the\r\nshape of a penis that were sold in Italy at the feast of SS. Cosmus and\r\nDamian. (see _Knight_, loco citato p. 62.)\r\n\r\n[327] _Longao_ or _Longano_ signifies the rectum—straight gut, the\r\nlarge intestine, the _longus anus_, prolonged anus, as it were. The\r\nword is found frequently in _Caelius Aurelianus_ and in _Vegetius_, De\r\nre veterin. (On Veterinary medicine). II. 14., 21., 28. IV. 8. Since\r\nthe large intestine was used for sausages (_Apicius_. De re coq.) (On\r\nCookery, Bk. IV. ch. 2.), the sausage was also called _longano_ or\r\n_longavo_. _Varro_, De ling. lat.

Comp. Bk. IX. Epigr. 48.; and\r\n_Juvenal_, Satir.

Shaggy limbs indeed and sturdy bristles\r\non your arms promise a rugged virtue; but your fundament is smooth, and\r\nthe great bursting swellings on it are cut, the doctor grinning the\r\nwhile.) _Seneca_, Epist. 114., Ille et crura, hic nec alas vellit. (One\r\nman plucks bare his very legs, another not even the armpits.)\r\n\r\n[337] _Aeschines_, Orat. in Timarch. p. 179., expresses it excellently,\r\nοὕτω τοὺς _πεπορνευμένους_, κᾂν μὴ παρῶμεν τοῖς αὐτῶν ἔργοις, ἐκ τῆς\r\nἀναιδείας καὶ τοῦ θράσους καὶ τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων γινώσκομεν. (So with\r\nregard to debauchees, even though we are not present at their actual\r\ndoings, we recognize them by their bold, shameless bearing and their\r\ngeneral habits.)\r\n\r\n[338] This was the special adornment of the woman, and was sacred to\r\nVenus; we read in _Ausonius_,\r\n\r\n  Barba Iovi, crines Veneri decor; ergo necesse est,\r\n  Ut nolint demi, quo sibi uterque placet.\r\n\r\n(The beard is Jove’s pride, her locks Venus’s: they must needs then\r\nobject to the removal of that wherein each takes special delight).\r\nHence _Ambrosius_ too, Hexamer. bk. VI., writes, Haud inscitum extat\r\nadagium: nullus comatus qui non idem cinaedus. (There is a familiar\r\nproverb that says: never a long-haired man but is a cinaedus.) In\r\n_Martial_, III. 58., they are called _capillati_ (long-haired.)\r\n\r\n[339] _Diogenes Laertius_, Vita Diogenis Bk. VI. 54.\r\n\r\n[340] Clouds, 340 sqq. See also (German) Translation of Aristophanes by\r\n_Fr. A. Wolf_.\r\n\r\n[341] Satir. II. 16. _W. E. Weber_ (“Die Satiren des _D. J.\r\nJuvenalis_.”—The Satires of Decimus Junius Juvenalis. Halle 1838.)\r\nis mistaken in his way of taking this passage. Not only does he in\r\nhis translation assign Peribomius’ words to Juvenal himself, but\r\nalso in the notes, pp. 286 sqq., gives quite wrong explanations of\r\nseveral words. For instance he says, “_inter Socraticos ... cinaedos_,\r\n(amongst the Socratic cinaedi), the Socratic breed of wantons, the kind\r\nthat give themselves an air of sober and highly moral habits, like\r\nSocrates;” but really the poet merely meant to express the idea of\r\nlater times that Socrates had been a paederast. Discussing the passage\r\nWeber remarks of Peribomius, “One who in looks and gait, as being\r\neffeminate and of a womanish dandified bearing, confesses his evil\r\nstate,—one of enervation and womanish amorousness,” whereas as a matter\r\nof fact Peribomius makes no other confession than simply that he is a\r\npathic. We are not to suppose any sort of intentional suppression of\r\nthe facts, as indeed is shown both by the rest of the translation and\r\nalso expressly on p. VI of the Preface; so we are bound to characterize\r\nwhat is said in these places as the result of downright mistake.\r\n\r\n[342] When _Juvenal_, V. 50., says: Hippo subit iuvenes et _morbo_\r\npallet _utroque_, (Hippo submits to young men, and is pale with a\r\ndouble disease), this must be understood to mean that Hippo is not only\r\na pathic, but also a Fellator (see subsequently). Further Epigr. 131.\r\nof _Ausonius_ is to the point in this connection:\r\n\r\n  Inguina quod calido levas tibi dropace, causa est:\r\n    Irritant volsas levia membra lupas;\r\n  Sed quod et elixo plantaria podice vellis,\r\n    Et teris incusas pumice Clazomenas,\r\n  Causa latet: _bimarem nisi quod patientia morbum\r\n    Appetit et tergo femina, pube vires_.\r\n\r\n(The reason why you make the private parts smooth with hot\r\npitch-ointment (as a depilatory) is this: Smooth limbs excite the\r\npassions of the harlots, plucked smooth themselves. But why you pluck\r\nthe hair from your fundament, soaked in hot water first, and polish\r\nwith pumice your well-pounded Clazomenae (i. e. buttocks) the reason is\r\nobscure: _unless indeed your long-suffering lust hankers for a double\r\ndisease (vice),—a woman behind, in your member a strong man_).\r\n\r\n_Manilius_, Astronomica bk. V. vv. 140-156., says:\r\n\r\n  Taurus, in aversos praeceps cum tollitur artus,\r\n  Sexta parte sui certantes luce sorores\r\n  Pleiades ducit: quibus aspirantibus, almam\r\n  In lucem eduntur Bacchi Venerisque sequaces:\r\n  Perque dapes, mensamque super petulantia corda,\r\n  Et sale mordaci dulces quaerentia risus.\r\n  Illis cura sui cultus, frontisque decorae\r\n  Semper erit: tortos in fluctum ponere crines,\r\n  Aut vinclis revocare comas et vertice denso\r\n  Fingere et appositis caput emutare capillis,\r\n  Pomicibusque cavis horrentia membra polire,\r\n  Atque odisse virum, sterilesque optare lacertos.\r\n  Femineae vestes; nec in usum tegmina plantis,\r\n  Sed speciem; fractique placent ad mollia gressus.\r\n  Naturae pudet atque habitat sub pectore caeca\r\n  Ambitio et _morbum_ virtutis nomine iactant.\r\n  Semper amare parum est: cupient et amare videri\r\n\r\n(When the Bull tending downwards lifts his head with limbs bent back,\r\nhe brings with him in his sixth house the sister Pleiades, his equals\r\nin brilliancy. When these are in the ascendent, there are brought forth\r\nto the light of day such as follow after Bacchus and Venus; and hearts\r\nthat wanton at feast and board, and that seek to raise the merry laugh\r\nby biting wit. These will ever be giving thought to their bedizenment\r\nand becoming appearance; to curl the hair and lay it in waving ripples\r\nor else to gather in the locks with circlets and arrange them in a\r\nheavy top-knot, and to alter the head by adding false ringlets; to\r\npolish the shaggy limbs with hollow pumice-stone; yea! and to hate the\r\nvery sight of a man, and long for arms without growth of hair. Women’s\r\nrobes they wear; the coverings of their feet are less for use than\r\nshow; and steps broken in to an effeminate gait are their delight.\r\nNature they scorn; indeed in their breast there lies a pride they\r\ncannot avow, and they vaunt their disease (vice) under the name of\r\nvirtue. Ever to love is a little thing in their eyes; their wish will\r\nbe to be seen to love).\r\n\r\n_Seneca_, Quaest. nat. bk. VII. ch. 31., Egenus etiam in quo _morbum\r\nsuum_ exerceat, legit. (The poor man too chooses one on whom he may\r\npractise his disease (vice).—_Seneca_, Epist. 114. Cum vero magis\r\nvires _morbus_ exedit et in medullas nervosque descendere deliciae.\r\n(But when the disease (vice) has eaten deeper into a man’s vigour, and\r\nits delights penetrated to the very marrow and nerves).—Comp. Epist.\r\n75.—_Cicero_, De finibus I. 18., in Verrem II. 1. 36., Tusc. quaest.\r\nIV. 11.—_Wyttenbach_, in Bibliothec. critic. Pt VIII. p. 73.—_Horace_,\r\nSat. I. 6. 40., Ut si qui aegrotat quo _morbo_ Barrus, haberi ut cupiat\r\nformosus. (As if one who is sick of the same _disease_ as Barrus, as if\r\nhe should long to be considered handsome.) Another passage of the same\r\nauthor (Odes I. 37. 9.) must be mentioned:\r\n\r\n  Contaminato cum grege turpium\r\n  _Morbo_ virorum.\r\n\r\n(With her (Cleopatra’s) herd of foul men stained with disease—vice). It\r\nis taken by _Stark_ as by most of the commentators to mean _castrated_\r\npersons, though strictly speaking it implies nothing more than a\r\ncontemptuous circumlocution for Egyptians. The boys that were kept in\r\nthe brothels at Rome for purposes of paederastia were for the most\r\npart from Egypt, whence they were imported in flocks. Accordingly\r\nthe poet calls the whole _entourage_ of Cleopatra pathics. There can\r\nbe no mistake, if only we translate thus: _cum contaminato grege\r\nvirorum, morbo turpium_, (with a polluted herd of men, defiled with\r\ndisease—vice). In this Horace was all the more justified, because as a\r\nmatter of fact Cleopatra did keep cinaedi, as we learn from _Suidas_:\r\ns. v. κίναιδα καὶ κιναιδία· ἠ ἀναισχυντία· ἀπὸ τοῦ κινεῖν τὰ αἰδοῖα. _Ὁ\r\nτῆς Κλεοπάτρας κίναιδος_ Χελιδὼν ἐκαλεῖτο. (under the words κίναιδα\r\nand κίναιδία: shameless practice; from the moving (τὸ κινεῖν of the\r\ngenitals. _Cleopatra’s cinaedus_ was called Chelidon. True _Terence_,\r\nEunuch. I. 2. 87., makes Phaedria say:\r\n\r\n  Porro _eunuchum_ dixisti velle te,\r\n  _Quia solae utuntur his reginae_, repperi,\r\n\r\n(I have discovered wherefore you said you wanted a _eunuch_, because\r\nonly queens use them) and Donatus observes on the passage that\r\n_reginae_ (queens) stands for _feminae divites_ (rich ladies).\r\nAccordingly just as Eunuchus is used for cinaedus or pathicus, in the\r\nsame way cinaedus might very well stand in _Suidas_ for eunuch, and\r\nas a matter of fact the _entourage_ of Cleopatra may have consisted\r\nof actual eunuchs. Still it is Horace’s main point that they were\r\n_pathics_. As to the reason why _reginae_ (queens, rich ladies) kept\r\n_castrati_ (eunuchs) at all, comp. p. 125 above.—The Latin _grex_\r\n(herd) is sufficiently explained by the παίδων ἀγέλας (herds of boys)\r\nin the passages already quoted (p. 131.) from _Tatian_ and _Justin\r\nMartyr_, along side which we may put the μειρακίων ὡραίων ἀγέλαι (herds\r\nof lads in the bloom of youth) of _Clement of Alexandria_, Paedag. bk.\r\nIII. ch. 4. The word is used in the same sense by _Seneca_, Epist 95.,\r\nTranseo _puerorum infelicium greges_, quos post transacta convivia\r\naliae cubiculi contumeliae expectant. Transeo _agmina exoletorum_ per\r\nnationes coloresque descripta. (I pass over the _herds of unhappy\r\nboys_, whom after the feast is done, other affronts of the bed-chamber\r\nawait. I pass over the _serried ranks of debauchees_ (cinaedi)\r\nmarshalled by nation and complexion.) _Cicero_, Ad Atticum I. 13.,\r\nConcursabant barbatuli iuvenes, totus ille _grex_ Catilinae, (Thither\r\nflocked the youths of the baby beards, all the _herd_ of Catiline’s\r\nfriends.) _Petronius_, Sat. ch. 40., Grex agit in scena mimum. (The\r\ncommon herd plays the mime on the stage.) _Grex_ was used generally\r\nfor any crowd of _common_ men.—The use of the word _contaminatus_\r\n(polluted) brings to mind _catamitus_, which bears the sense of\r\npathic, e. g. in _Cicero_, Philipp. II. 31., _Appuleius_, Metam.

I. 2. 34.—_Festus_: Catamitum pro Ganymede dixerunt, qui\r\nfuit Jovis concubinus, (Men said _catamitus_ for Ganymedes, who was\r\nJupiter’s bed-fellow),—which probably led to the ridiculous idea\r\nbeing entertained, e.g. by _Scheller_, that the word was derived from\r\n_Ganymedes_ by corruption in the pronunciation! The fact that the\r\nword is metrically a “Paeon tertius”, that is to say the _i_ in the\r\nthird syllable is long, might have led us at once to the conclusion\r\nthat originally the word was _catamytus_, and derived from the\r\nGreek καταμύσσω (to tear), and so has the same meaning as the Latin\r\n_percisus_ (cut), or else that it stands for καταμίκτος (mixed), and\r\nis connected with καταμίγνυμι (to mix), and so in fact _concubinus_\r\n(sharing the bed), as Festus says! At any rate the passages quoted\r\nabove from Cicero and Seneca, which might easily be multiplied, prove\r\nthat Stark’s supposition expressed on p. 22., to the effect that\r\n_morbus_ (disease) is used in this sense _only_ in the poets, is\r\nunfounded.\r\n\r\n[343] _Menander_, in _Lucian_, Amores ch. 43., says: νόσων χαλεπωτάτη\r\nφθόνος (of _diseases_ the cruellest is envy.) It is used of envy by\r\nAristophanes, Birds 31. νόσον νοσοῦμεν τὴν ἐναντίαν Σάκᾳ. (we are sick\r\nof the _disease_ that was Saces’ enemy.) _Euripides_, Medea 525.,\r\nγλωσσαλγία αἴσχιστος νόσος (garrulousness, a most shocking _disease_.)\r\nBut in a special way νόσος (disease) was used of Love (_Pollux_)\r\nOnomast. Bk. VI. 42., εἰς Ἀφροδίτην νοσῶν. (being sick of Love).\r\n_Eubulus_, in Nannio, quoted by _Athenaeus_, Deipnos. Bk. XIII. ch.\r\n24., says:\r\n\r\n  μικροῦ πρίασθαι κέρματος τὴν ἡδονήν\r\n  καὶ μὴ λαθραίαν Κύπριν (αἰσχίστην _νόσων_\r\n  πασῶν) διώκειν, ὕβρεος, οὐ πόθου χάριν.\r\n\r\n(To buy pleasure for a small coin, and not pursue secret amours,—most\r\nbase of all diseases,—for overmastering lust’s sake and not for love.)\r\nΝόσημα (disease) is used in the same sense in _Lucian_, Amores 3.,\r\nand πάθος (suffering, passion) in many passages in the same Work.\r\n_Plutarch_, Amator. p. 763., καὶ λελάληκε (Μένανδρος) περὶ τοῦ πάθους\r\nφιλοσοφώτερον. (And he—Menander—has talked about the passion more\r\nlike a philosopher). The following passage in _Philo_, De specialibus\r\nlegibus,—Opera. edit. Mangey, Vol. II. p. 301., is of interest: Ἔχει\r\nμὲν οὖν καὶ ἡ κατὰ φύσιν ἡδονὴ πολλάκις μέμψιν, ὅταν ἀμέτρως καὶ\r\nἀκορέστως χρῆταί τις αὐτῇ, καθάπερ οἱ ἄπληστοι περὶ ἐδωδὴν, κἂν εἰ\r\nμηδὲν τῶν ἀπηγορευμένων προσφέροιντο· καὶ οἱ φιλογυναίοις συνουσίαις\r\nἐπιμιμηνότες, καὶ λαγνίστερον προσομιλοῦντες γυναιξὶν οὐκ ἀλλοτρίαις,\r\nἀλλὰ ταῖς ἐαυτῶν. _Ἡ δὲ μέμψις σώματός ἐστι μᾶλλον ἢ ψυχῆς κατὰ τοὺς\r\nπολλοὺς, πολλὴν μὲν ἔχοντος εἴσω φλόγα, ἣ τὴν παραβληθεῖσαν τροφὴν\r\nἐξαναλίσκουσα ἑτέραν οὐκ εἰς μακρὰν ἐπιζητεῖ πολλὴν ἰκμάδα, ἧς τὸ\r\nῥοῶδες διὰ τῶν γενητικῶν ἀποχετεύετο, κνησμοὺς καὶ ὀδαξισμοὺς ἐμποιοῦν\r\nκαὶ γαργαλισμοὺς ἀπαύσους_.\r\n\r\n(So the gratification even of natural pleasure is often blameworthy,\r\nwhen it is indulged immoderately and insatiably, just as men who are\r\ninsatiably greedy about eating are blameworthy, even though they should\r\nnot partake of any forbidden meats. So too men who are madly devoted\r\nto intercourse with women, and go with women lewdly,—not strange women\r\nbut their own wives. _And the blame lies rather with the body than with\r\nthe mind in most cases, for the body has within it a great flame, which\r\nusing up the fuel cast to it, does not for long lack much moisture,\r\nthe watery humour of which is drawn off by intercourse with women,\r\nproducing ticklings and gnashings with the teeth and unappeasable\r\nitchings._) Immoderate copulation then with a man’s own wife is only\r\na reproach that concerns the body more than the mind; on the other\r\nhand _Philo_ in the succeeding sentences speaks of those who practise\r\nfornication with _strange_ women as, ἀνίατον νόσον ψυχῆς νοσοῦντας\r\n(sick of an incurable sickness of the soul., _Clement of Alexandria_)\r\nPaedag. bk.

(ch. 5., But this is the very condition of people who are\r\nunder the influence of passion; for fits of anger and the desires of\r\nsensual pleasures and some such things do unmistakably produce a change\r\nin the condition of the body, and in some cases actually cause madness.\r\nIt is clear then that we must regard incontinent people as being in\r\nmuch the same condition as people so affected, i.e. people asleep or\r\nmad or intoxicated.—ch. 6., Other such states again are the results\r\nof a morbid disposition or of habit, as e.g. the practice of plucking\r\nout one’s hair, or biting one’s nails, or eating cinders and earth,\r\n_or of committing unnatural vice_; for these habits are sometimes\r\nnatural,—when a person’s nature is vicious,—and sometimes acquired,\r\nas e.g. by those who are the victims of outrage from childhood. Now\r\nwhenever nature is the cause of these habits, nobody would call people\r\nwho give way to them incontinent, any more than we should call women\r\nincontinent for being not males, but females.—For all excess whether\r\nof folly, cowardice, incontinence, or savagery is either brutal or\r\nmorbid.—ch. 8., for he is necessarily incapable of repentance and\r\nis therefore incurable, as to be incapable of _repentance is to be\r\nincurable_:—If a person gives in where people generally resist and\r\nare capable of resisting, he deserves to be called effeminate and\r\nluxurious; for luxury is a form of effeminacy. Such a person will\r\nlet his cloak trail in the mud to avoid the trouble of lifting it\r\nup, etc.—if a person is mastered by things against which most people\r\nsucceed in holding out, and is impotent to struggle against them,\r\nunless his impotence is due to hereditary constitution or to disease,\r\nas effeminacy is hereditary in the kings of Scythia, or as a woman is\r\nnaturally weaker than a man. But the man addicted to boys would seem\r\nto be incontinent, and is effeminate.—_Incontinence_ assumes sometimes\r\nthe form of impetuosity, and at other times that of _weakness_. Some\r\nmen deliberate, but _their emotion_ prevents them from abiding by the\r\nresult of their deliberation; others again do not deliberate, and are\r\ntherefore carried away _by their emotion_).\r\n\r\nThis passage has been quite misunderstood by _Stark_, loco citato\r\np. 27, for he has made it too refer to the νοῦσος θήλεια (feminine\r\ndisease); in this error indeed _Camerarius_, (Explic. Ethic. Aristot.\r\nNicomach.—Explanations of Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics—Frankfort\r\n1578, 4to., p. 344) whom he cites, had preceded him. _Stark_ says:\r\nExcusat autor eos, qui propter naturae quandam mollitiem et levitatem\r\nvitiorum illecebris resistere nequeant. Haec infirmitas vel ex morbo\r\nprocreata vel a sexus differente natura profecta esse potest. Quarum\r\nrationum exempla et _quidem alterius_ _διὰ νόσον_, _Scytharum morbum_,\r\nalterius διὰ φύσιν τοῦ γένους mulierum debilitatem affert. (The author\r\nis excusing such as on account of a certain softness and lightness of\r\nnature cannot resist the allurements of vice. This weakness may have\r\nbeen either induced by disease, or have sprung from the different\r\nnature of the sexes. Of which cases he gives two examples—_of the one_\r\nδιὰ νόσον (_on account of disease_), _the disease of the Scythians_,\r\nof the other διὰ φύσιν τοῦ γένους (on account of congenital nature),\r\nthe relative weakness of women). But Aristotle says expressly in the\r\npassage that the μαλακία (softness, effeminacy) of the Scythians,\r\nas well as of a woman, was διὰ γένους (congenital),—that Scythians\r\nequally with women are weakly by birth; while his examples of the\r\nδιὰ νόσον (on account of disease) do not come till further on. The\r\nScythians, he says, like women, are μαλακοί (soft), and the same is\r\ntrue of the man who practises vices with boys (παιδιώδης); it is a\r\npart of their nature, and so they are not ἀκόλαστοι (“intemperate”),\r\nfor the ἀκόλαστος is such a man as cannot owing to disease govern\r\nhimself (ἀκρασία, ἀσθενεία, διὰ τὸ πάθος—incontinence, weakness,\r\nowing to passion). Thus the question cannot possibly be here of the\r\nνοῦσος θήλεια (feminine disease), but merely of a weakly, effeminate\r\nmode of life; and this is properly speaking μαλακία, while the vice\r\nof the pathic is called μαλθακία,—but the two words were constantly\r\ninterchanged, and thus a part of the blame for the mistake may very\r\nwell lie with the transcribers. A Pathic is habitually μαλακός, but\r\nthe μαλακὸς is not necessarily also a Pathic. Hence it might very\r\nprobably be right to read, as Aspasius and other editors have actually\r\ndone, Περσῶν for Σκυθῶν (kings _of the Persians_ for kings _of the\r\nScythians_), even though the MSS. show no variants; and indeed to\r\nconfirm this one might bring forward the trailing of the cloak (ὃς\r\nἕλκει τὸ ἱμάτιον—the man who trails his cloak) which is mentioned\r\nas an example, and which was, as is well known, a fashion among the\r\nPersians.—ch. 10., οὐ γὰρ πᾶς ὁ δι’ ἡδονήν τι πράττων οὔτ’ ἀκόλαστος\r\nοὔτε φαῦλος οὔτ’ ἀκρατής, ἀλλ’ ὁ δι’ αἰσχράν. (For not every man that\r\ndoes a thing for pleasure is “intemperate” or base or incontinent, but\r\nhe that does it for _disgraceful_ pleasure).\r\n\r\n[349] _Cicero_, De Divinat. I. 38., Aristoteles quidem eos etiam,\r\nqui valetudinis vitio furerent et melancholici dicerentur, censebat\r\nhabere aliquid in animis praesagiens atque divinum. (Aristotle indeed\r\nconsidered that such men as were mad in consequence of ill-health and\r\nwere called “melancholics”, also possessed in their minds somewhat of\r\nthe prophetic and divine).\r\n\r\n[350] _Aristotle_, Nicomach. Ethics VII. ch. 11., ὁ μὲν γὰρ ἀκρατὴς\r\nοὐκ ἐμμένει τῷ λόγῳ διὰ τὸ μᾶλλον. ch. 12. ἔτι ἐμπόδιον τῷ φρονεῖν\r\nαἱ ἡδοναὶ, καὶ ὅσῳ μᾶλλον χαίρει, μᾶλλον, οἷον τὴν τῶν ἀφροδισίων\r\nοὐδένα γὰρ ἂν δύνασθαι νοῆσαί τι ἐν αὐτῇ.... ἔτι παιδία καὶ θηρία\r\nδιώκει τὰς ἡδονάς. (For the reason why the incontinent person does\r\nnot abide by reason lies in an excess.—ch. 12., Pleasures too are an\r\nimpediment to thoughtfulness, and the greater the pleasure, the greater\r\nthe impediment, as e.g. the pleasure of love, for thought is out of\r\nthe question, while it lasts.... And lastly children and brute beasts\r\npursue pleasure).\r\n\r\n[351] So _Quintilian_, Declam. III., says: Siculi in tantum vitio\r\nregnant, ut obscoenis cupiditatibus natura cesserit, ut pollutis _in\r\nfemineam_ usque _patientiam_ maribus incurrat iam libido in sexum suum.\r\n(The Sicilians are so predominant in vice, that Nature has ceased to\r\nsatisfy their fool lusts,—that males are debauched to _a feminine\r\npassivity_ (to suffer treatment proper to women), and men fall back for\r\nthe gratification of their concupiscence on their own sex).\r\n\r\n_Seneca_, Epist. 95., Libidine vero ne maribus quidem cedunt, _pati\r\nnatae_. (In concupiscence they yield not even to males, _though born to\r\nthe_ passive part).\r\n\r\n[352] Nonne vehementissime admiraretur, si quisquam non gratissimum\r\nmunus arbitraretur, virum se natum, sed depravato naturae beneficio\r\nin _mulierem convertere se_ properasset. (Should one not marvel\r\nexceedingly, if any man should fail to hold it a most excellent\r\nprivilege to have been born a man, but should rather, degrading the\r\ngift of nature, have hasted _to turn himself into a woman_) says\r\n_Rutilius Lupus_, De figur. sentent. bk. II. Speaking of men who use\r\nunguents, _Clement of Alexandria_, Paedag. bk. II. ch. 8. p. 177.,\r\nsays, ἀνδρωνῖτιν ἐκθηλύνουσιν and τὰ γενικὰ ἐκθηλύνειν (they womanize\r\ntheir manhood, to womanize their sex). Similarly, though with a\r\ndifferent reference, _Clearchus_ says of the Lydians, τέλος, τὰς ψυχὰς\r\nἄποθηλυνθεντες ἦλλαξάντο τὸν τῶν γυναικῶν βίον. (in fine, having become\r\nwomanized in their souls, they adopted the mode of life of women).\r\n_Athenaeus_, Deipnos. XII. p. 516.\r\n\r\n[353] Hence paederastia is called also πασχητιασμός (practice of\r\n_passive_ lust) in _Lucian_, Gallus 32. _Clement of Alexandria_,\r\nPaedag. bk. II. ch. 10. _Eustathius_, Comment. in Hexameron. p. 38.\r\nAlso the verb πασχητιάω (to indulge in passive lust) is found in\r\n_Lucian_, Amor. 26., in this sense. The same is excellently expressed\r\nby an anonymous poet in the Greek Anthology. bk. II. tit. 5. No. 2.,\r\n\r\n  Ἀνέρας ἠρνήσαντο, καὶ οὐκ ἐγένοντο γυναῖκες·\r\n  Οὔτ’ ἄνδρες γεγάασιν, ἐπεὶ πάθων ἔργα γυναικῶν,\r\n  Οὐδὲ γυναῖκες ἔασιν, ἐπεὶ φύσιν ἔλλαχον ἀνδρῶν.\r\n  Ἀνέρες εἰσὶ γυναιξὶ καὶ ἀνδράσιν εἰσὶ γυναῖκες.\r\n\r\n(They refused to be men, and failed to become women. They are no men,\r\nfor they endure the tasks of women, nor yet are they women, for they\r\ninherited at birth the nature of men. Men are they to women, and women\r\nto men).\r\n\r\nIn _Aeschines_, Orat. in Timarch., edit. Reiske p. 128., the pathic\r\nTimarchus is called the γυνὴ (woman, wife) of Hegesander, his violator:\r\nθαυμασάντων δὲ ὑμῶν, πῶς ἀνὴρ καὶ γυνὴ, καὶ τίς ὁ λόγος, εἶπε μικρὸν\r\nδιαλιπών· ἀγνοεῖτε, ἔφη, ὅ, τι λέγω· ὁ μὲν ἀνὴρ ἐστὶν Ἡγήσανδρος\r\nἐκεῖνος νυνὶ, ἔφη, πρότερον δ’ ἦν καὶ αὐτὸς Λεωδάμαντος _γυνὴ· ἡ δὲ\r\nγυνὴ_ Τίμαρχος οὑτοσίν. (And when you wondered how he could be man\r\nand woman, and what the phrase meant, he replied after a moment’s\r\npause. You don’t understand, he cried, what I mean. The husband is\r\nHegesander yonder, he went on, now; but once Hegesander himself was\r\n_wife_ of Leodamas; and the _wife_ of Hegesander is Timarchus here).\r\n_St. Amphilochius_, who lived under Theodosius, says in his “Epistola\r\niambica ad Seleucum” (Letter in iambic verse to Seleucus) vv. 90-99.,\r\n\r\n  ἄλλοι δ’ ἐκείνων ἔθνος ἀθλιώτατον,\r\n  τῶν ἀῤῥένων τὴν δόξαν ἐξορχούμενον,\r\n  μελῶν λιγυσμοῖς συγκατακλῶντες φύσιν.\r\n  ἄνδρες, γυναῖκες ἄῤῥενες, θηλυδρίαι.\r\n  Οὐκ ἄνδρες, οὐ γυναῖκες, ἀψευδεῖ λόγῳ.\r\n  Τὸ μὲν γὰρ οὐ μένουσι, τὸ δ’ οὐκ ἔφθασαν,\r\n  Ὃ μὲν γὰρ εἰσὶν οὐ μένουσι τῷ τρόπῳ,\r\n  ὃ δ’ αὖ κακῶς θέλουσιν, οὐκ εἰσὶν φύσει.\r\n  Ἀσωτίας αἴνιγμα καὶ γρίφος παθῶν.\r\n  ἄνδρες γυναιξὶ καὶ γυναῖκες ἀνδράσιν.\r\n\r\n(Others of them belong to that most miserable tribe that dances away\r\ntheir repute as man, breaking down their nature to the shrill tones of\r\nsongs,—men that are male women, womanish men.

But giving way to effeminacy, they\r\nplay at being women, cutting the hair in ignoble and meretricious\r\nfashion; decked out too in transparent robes, chewing mastich-gum and\r\nscented with myrrh. What should a man say, on seeing them? Why! exactly\r\nlike a phrenologist, he divines them from their look as adulterers\r\nand _men-women, such as hunt after both kinds of Love_,—abhorrers\r\nof hair, hairless men, that loathe the bloom of manhood,—men that\r\ndress their locks like women.—For these men’s needs cities are full\r\nof such as apply pitch-ointments, sear and pluck out the hairs of\r\nthese _effeminates_. For this purpose shops are established and open\r\neverywhere; and artistes of this meretricious harlotry earn many a fee\r\nopenly, the artistes that lay on the pitch-ointments for them.

L.\r\nKlose_ in Ersch und Gruber, Encyclopädie: Article, Paederastia, Sect.\r\nIII Vol. 9. p. 148. In fact it is the usual practice of the paederast\r\nto elicit the pathic’s semen at the same time by using the hand!\r\n\r\n[358] περὶ ὕψους, ch. 28., Καὶ τὸ ἀμίμητον ἐκεῖνο τοῦ Ἡροδότου, τῶν δὲ\r\nΣκυθέων τοῖς συλήσασι τὸ ἱερὸν ἐνέβαλεν ἡ θεὸς _θήλειαν νοῦσον_. (And\r\nthat inimitable phrase of Herodotus’, “and on such of the Scythians as\r\nplundered her temple the goddess inflicted _feminine disease_.”)\r\n\r\n[359] De figuris, edit. J. Fr. Boissonade. London 1818. 8vo., ch. 35\r\npp. 56 sqq., Περίφρασις δ’ ἔστιν ὅταν τῆς ἁπλῆς καὶ εὐθεῖας γινομένης\r\nἑρμενείας εὐτελοῦς οὔσης, μεταβαλλόντες, κόσμου ἕνεκα ἢ πάθους, ἢ\r\nμεγαλοπρεπείας, ἄλλοις ὀνόμασι, καὶ πλείοσι τῶν κυρίων καὶ ἀναγκαίων,\r\nτὸ πρᾶγμα ἑρμηνεύσωμεν· οἷον ἐστὶ—παρὰ δὲ Ἡροδότῳ, ἐνέσκηψεν _ἡ θεὸς\r\nθήλειαν νόσον, ἀντὶ τοῦ ἐποίησεν ἀνδρογύνους ἢ κατεαγότας_. (for\r\ntranslation see text above). The Greek word κατεαγότας (broken,\r\nenervated) corresponds to the Latin _percisus_. The Romans undoubtedly\r\nused _effeminatus_ (effeminate) as synonymous with _cinaedus_,\r\nas is shown by a passage in _Seneca_, De benefic., bk. VII. ch.\r\n25., Aristippus aliquando delectatus unguento, male, inquit, istis\r\n_effeminatis_ eveniat, qui rem tam bellam infamaverunt. (On one\r\noccasion Aristippus being much pleased with a certain perfume, said:\r\nConfound those vile _effeminates_, who have made so fine a delicacy\r\ninfamous). This is obviously a free translation of the Greek words as\r\nthey stand in _Diogenes Laertius_, Vita Aristippi, bk. II. ch. 8. note\r\n4.,—and in _Clement of Alexandria_, Paedag., bk. II. ch. 8. p. 279.,\r\nἈρίστιππος γοῦν ὁ φιλόσοφος, χρισάμενος μύρῳ, κακοὺς κακῶς ἀπολωλέναι\r\nχρῆναι τοὺς κιναίδους ἔφασκεν, τοῦ μύρου τὴν ὠφέλειαν εἰς λοιδορίαν\r\nδιαβεβληκότας. (Now Aristippus the philosopher, after he had anointed\r\nhimself with myrrh, said, foully should the foul cinaedi perish,\r\nbecause they have brought into disrepute that excellent creature\r\nmyrrh.).\r\n\r\n[360] Bk. IV. ch. 67.\r\n\r\n[361] Perhaps it is from this that Bacchus gets his secondary title of\r\n_Attis_. _Clement of Alexandria_, Ad Gentes, p. 12, says, δι’ ἣν αἰτίαν\r\nοὐκ ἀπεικότως τὸν Διόνυσόν τινες Ἄττιν προσαγορεύεσθαι θέλουσιν,\r\nαἰδοίων ἐστερημένον. (For which reason some maintain, and not without\r\nprobability, that Dionysus is called Attis, as being deprived of the\r\ngenital organs). According to the Scholiast to _Lucian_, De Dea Syra,\r\nch. 16, Dionysus was roaming about in the search for his mother Semelé,\r\nwhen he came upon Polyymnus, and the latter promised to reveal his\r\nmother’s place of abode, if he would practise paederastia with him.\r\nThis he did, and Polyymnus accompanied him to Lerna, where Semelé\r\nwould seem to have been, and died there. Mourning the death of his\r\npaederast, Dionysus hewed out of fig-tree wood private parts of wood,\r\nand carried them about with him constantly in memory of Polyymnus. For\r\nthis reason Dionysus is worshipped with Phallic emblems. (λυπηθεὶς δὲ\r\n ὁ Διόνυσος, ὅτε ὁ ἑραστὴς αὐτοῦ ἔθνησκε, αἰδοῖον ξύλινον ἐκ συκίνου\r\nξύλου πελεκήσας, κατεῖχεν ἀεὶ πρὸς μνήμην τοῦ Πολυύμνου· διὰ ταύτην\r\nτὴν αἰτίαν τοῖς φαλλοῖς τιμῶσιν τὸν Διόνυσον.) The story is related\r\nat greater length by _Clement of Alexandria_, Cohortat. ad Gentes,\r\np. 22; but he calls the lover Prosymnus (as does _Arnobius_, bk. V.\r\n27. Comp. Tzetzes, in Lycophron., 213), and actually makes Bacchus\r\npractise _Onania postica_ (Masturbation by the posterior), for he\r\nsays: ἀφοσιούμενος τῷ ἐραστῇ ὁ Διόνυσος, ἐπὶ τὸ μνημεῖον ὁρμᾷ, καὶ\r\n_πασχητιᾷ_· κλάδον οὖν συκῆς, ὡς ἔτυχεν, ἐκτεμνὼν ἀνδρείου μορίου\r\nσκευάζεται τρόπον· _ἐφέζεταί τε τῷ κλάδῳ_, τὴν ὑπόχεσιν ἐκτελῶν\r\nτῷ νεκρῷ ὑπόμνημα τοῦ πάθους τούτου μυστικὸν· φαλλοὶ κατὰ πόλεις\r\nἀνίστανται Διονύσῳ. (Dionysus by way of performing due service to his\r\nlover’s memory, hastens to his tomb, and proceeds to _practise passive\r\nlust_. So cutting down the branch of a fig-tree, he fashions it to\r\na semblance of a man’s member; and then he _mounts the branch in a\r\nsitting posture_, fulfilling his promise to the dead man,—a mystic\r\nmemorial of his pathic loves. Phalli are set up in Cities in honour of\r\nDionysus). In Arnobius, loco citato, we read that Dionysus: Ficorum ex\r\narbore ramum validissimum praeferens dolat, runcinat, levigat et humani\r\npenis fabricatur in speciem: figit super aggerem tumuli, et postica ex\r\nparte nudatus, accedit, subdit, insidit. Lascivia deinde luxuriantis\r\nassumpta, huc atque illuc clunes torquet et meditatur ab ligno pati,\r\nquod iam dudum in veritate promiserat.—(Bringing with him a sturdy\r\nbranch of a fig-tree, hews, planes and smoothes it, and fashions it\r\ninto the shape of a man’s penis; then he fixes it upright on the mound\r\nof the tomb, and stripping his posteriors, advances, mounts, and sits\r\ndown on it. Then imitating the lascivious motions of a wanton in the\r\nact, writhes his buttocks this way and that, and imagines himself to be\r\nreceiving from the wooden member the treatment which he had long ago\r\npromised in reality). Similarly we read in _Petronius_, Sat., Profert\r\nEnothea _scorteum fascinum_ quod ut oleo et minuto pipere atque urticae\r\ntrito circumdedit semine, paulatim coepit inserere ano meo. (Enothea\r\nproduces a _man’s member made of leather_, which first of all she\r\ncovered with oil and ground pepper and pounded nettle-seed, and then\r\nbegan by degrees to push it up my anus). Now too we shall be able to\r\nexplain to our satisfaction what is the meaning of the phrase συκίνη\r\nἐπικουρία ἐπὶ τῶν ἀσθενῶν (_fig-wood_ succour,—said of weak allies),\r\nwhich is mentioned by _Suidas_ under the word ὄλισβος (artificial\r\nmember), and for which in the passage quoted above _Aristophanes_\r\nsubstitutes σκυτίνη ’πικουρία (_leathern_ succour). On this the\r\nScholiast observes: σκυτίνην ἐπικουρίαν καλεῖ τὴν σκυτίνην βοήθειον,\r\nεἴτε τὴν δερματίνην βοήθειαν, τὴν πληροῦσαν ἐπιθυμίαν ἀντὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν·\r\nτοῦτο δὲ ποιοῦσιν αἱ ἀκόλαστοι γυναῖκες· σκυτίνην δὲ ἐπικουρίαν λέγει,\r\nπαρὰ τὴν παροιμίαν· Συκίνη ἐπικουρία· ἐπὶ τῶν ἀσθενῶν βοηθημάτων καὶ\r\nἴσως ἐνταῦθα γραπτέον, συκίνη ἀντὶ τοῦ σκυτίνη. (_leathern succour_: so\r\nAristophanes calls the leathern help, or help of hide, the instrument\r\nthat satisfies (women’s) longings in default of men. This is a practice\r\nthat incontinent women follow. He says leathern (σκυτίνη), succour\r\nplaying on the proverb, “Fig-wood (συκίνη) succour”, said of weak\r\nefforts at assistance. Possibly we should read συκίνη (of fig-wood)\r\nfor σκυτίνη (of leather) here. Again: _σκυτάλαι_· στρογγύλα καὶ λεῖα\r\nξύλα.—_σκυτάλη_· βακτηρία ἀκροπαχής (batons: rounded and polished\r\nstaves)—(baton: a blunt-pointed staff) in _Suidas_, and the passage in\r\nAristophanes, τοῦτ’ ἔστ’ ἐκεῖνο τῶν σκυτάλων, ὧν πέρδετο (this is the\r\nparticular baton that made him break wind), which _Suidas_, under the\r\nword σκυτάλον (baton) has obviously misunderstood, just as much as the\r\nScholiast has. For in all these passages it is the _Priapus ficulnus_\r\n(Priapus of fig-wood), also well-known to the Romans, that we must\r\nunderstand to be intended. Apposite in this connection is Horace’s\r\n(Sat I. 8. 1.), Olim truncus eram, inutile lignum (Once the trunk of a\r\nfig-tree was I, a useless log,)—on which the commentators have wasted a\r\nhost of extraordinary interpretations.\r\n\r\n[362] Symposion, p. 189., _ἀνδρόγυνον_ γὰρ ἓν τότε μὲν ἦν καὶ εἶδος,\r\n_καὶ ὄνομα, ἐξ ἀμφοτέρων κοινὸν τοῦ τε ἄῤῥενος καὶ θήλεος_. (For then\r\nthere was a third, a man-woman, sex, in form as well as in name,\r\ncommingled of both sexes, the male and the female.) Plainer still is\r\nthis passage from _Lucian_, Amores 28., πᾶσα δὲ ἡμῶν ἡ γυναικωνῖτις\r\nἔστω Φιλαινὶς, _ἀνδρογύνους ἔρωτας_ ἀσχημονοῦσα. καὶ πόσῳ κρεῖττον\r\nεἰς ἄῤῥενα τρυφὴν βιάζεσθαι γυναῖκα ἢ τὸ γενναῖον ἀνδρῶν εἰς γυναῖκα\r\nθηλύνεσθαι· (And let all our women’s apartments be Philaenis, foully\r\nindulging in male-female loves. And how much better it were that\r\na woman should trespass on male wantonness than that the noble\r\nmanliness of men should be effeminated and made womanish.) _Clement\r\nof Alexandria_, Paedag., bk. II. ch. 10., ἐντεῦθεν συμφανὲς ἡμῖν\r\nὁμολογουμένως παραιτεῖσθαι δεῖν τὰς ἀῤῥενομιξίας, καὶ τὰς ἀκράτους\r\nσπορὰς καὶ κατόπιν εὐνὰς καὶ τὰς ἀσυμφύεις _ἀνδρογύνους κοινωνίας_.\r\n(Hence it is manifest we ought avowedly to deprecate intercourse with\r\nmales and inordinate embraces and copulation behind and unnatural\r\n_unions of men-women_.) A little further on the same author says, αἱ\r\nδολεραὶ γυναῖκες καὶ _τῶν ἀνδρῶν οἱ γυναικώδεις_. (deceitful women\r\nand the _womanish kind_ of men,) and speaks of θηλυδριώδης ἐπιθυμία\r\n(effeminate lustfulness). A résumé of pretty nearly all words of\r\nthis class is given by _Suidas_, s. v. Ἄῤῥεν καὶ Ἀῤῥενικῶς. Καὶ\r\nἡμίανδρος καὶ ἡμιγύναιξ καὶ διγενὴς καὶ θηλυδρίας, καὶ ἑρμαφρόδιτος,\r\nκαὶ ἴθρις, οὗ ἰσχὺς τεθέρισται· καὶ ἀῤῥενωπὸς, ὁ ἀνδρόγυνος· καὶ ὁ\r\nἀνδρεῖος· ὁ στεῤῥὸς· λέγουσι δ’ οὕτω τὰ μὲν ἄλλα γύνιδας, ἔχοντας δέ\r\nτι ἀνδρόμορφον. Ἱππῶναξ δὲ, ἡμίανδρον, τὸν οἷον ἡμιγύναικα· λέγεται\r\nδὲ καὶ ἀπόκοπος, καὶ βάκηλος [βάτταλος] καὶ ἀνδρόγυνος, καὶ Γάλλος,\r\nκαὶ γύννις, καὶ Ἄττις καὶ εύνουχώδης. (under the words Ἄῤῥεν and\r\nἀῤῥενικῶς (masculine, masculinely): Semi-man, semi-woman, double-sexed,\r\nwomanish man, hermaphrodite, eunuch—one whose virility has been cut;\r\nmasculine-looking, the man-woman,—also the manly, the strong, man. By\r\nsuch names are signified effeminate men that yet have some look of men.\r\nHipponax also uses in this sense semi-man, and its synonym semi-woman.\r\nSuch a one is called also castrated, eunuch (pathic), man-woman,\r\nGallus—eunuch-priest of Cybelé, Attis, eunuch-like.) The same holds\r\ngood of the word εὐνοῦχος (eunuch), which by no means signifies only\r\nactual castrated eunuchs. Thus _Clement of Alexandria_, Paedagog.,\r\nbk. III. ch. 4., says, εὐνοῦχος δὲ ἀληθὴς, οὐχ ὁ μὴ δυνάμενος, ἀλλ’ ὁ\r\nμὴ βουλόμενος φιληδεῖν· ... εὐνοῦχοι πολλοὶ, καὶ οὗτοι μαστροποὶ τῷ\r\nἀξιοπίστῳ τοῦ μὴ δύνασθαι φιληδεῖν, τοῖς εἰς ἡδονὰς ἐθέλουσι ῥαθυμεῖν\r\nἀνυπόπτως διακονούμενοι. (But the true eunuch is not he that cannot,\r\nbut he that will not, love.... Many eunuchs, and these serving as\r\npandars, by reason of the certainty that they cannot love, to such as\r\nare fain to indulge in secure pleasures without suspicion.)\r\n\r\n[363] Oneirocritica., bk. V. ch. 65., Ἔδοξέ τις τὸ αἰδοῖον αὐτοῦ ἄχρις\r\nἄκρας τῆς κορώνης τετριχῶσθαι, καὶ λάσιον εἶναι πυκνῶν πάνυ τριχῶν\r\nαἰφνίδιον φυεισῶν· ἀποπεφασμένος κίναιδος ἐγένετο πάσῃ μὲν ἀκολάστῳ\r\nχρησάμενος ἡδονῇ, _θηλυδρίας ὢν καὶ ἀνδρόγυνος_, μόνῳ δὲ τῷ αἰδοίῳ κατὰ\r\nνόμον ἀνδρῶν μὴ χρώμενος. Τοιγαροῦν οὕτως ἤδη ἀργὸν ἦν αὐτῷ τὸ μέρος\r\nἐκεῖνο, ὡς διὰ τὸ μὴ τρίβεσθαι πρὸς ἕτερον σῶμα καὶ τρίχας ἐκφύσαι.\r\n(for translation see text above).\r\n\r\n[364] _Ἀνδρόγυνον_ κωμῳδεῖν ἔδοξέ τις δρᾶμα· ἐνόσησεν αὐτῷ τὸ αἰδοῖον.\r\nΓάλλους ὁρᾶν ἔδοξέ τις· ἐνόσησεν αὐτῷ τὸ αἰδοῖον. Τὸ μὲν πρῶτον διὰ\r\nτὸ ὄνομα οὕτως ἀπέβη, τὸ δὲ δεύτερον διὰ τὸ συμβεβηκὸς τοῖς ὁρωμένοις.\r\nΚαί τοι καὶ τὸ κωμῳδεῖν οἰσθα ὃ σημαίνει, καὶ τὸ Γάλλους ὁρᾶν. Μέμνησο\r\nδὲ, ὅτι, εἴτε κωμῳδεῖν, εἴτε τραγῳδεῖν ὑπολάβοι τις, καὶ μνημονεύει,\r\nκατά τὴν ὑπόθεσιν τοῦ δράματος κρίνεται καὶ τὰ ἀποτελέσματα. (for\r\ntranslation see text above). The signification of κωμῳδεῖν and\r\nτραγῳδεῖν (to represent Comedy, Tragedy) is given by _Artemidorus_,\r\nbk. I. ch. 56. As to the _Galli_ comp. bk. II. 69. In bk. II. ch. 12.\r\nwe read: Ὕαινα δὲ γυναῖκα σημαίνει _ἀνδρόγυνον_ ἢ φαρμακίδα, καὶ ἄνδρα\r\nκίναιδον οὐκ εὐγνώμονα. (Hyaena signifies a woman that is _male-female_\r\nor a sorceress, and a man that is a cinaedus without moderation). It\r\nwas a widespread belief amongst the Ancients that the hyaena was at\r\none time a male and at another a female (comp. _Aelian_, Hist. anim.,\r\nI. 25. _Horapollo_, Hieroglyph., II. 65. _Ovid_, Metamorph., Bk. XV.\r\nFab. 38. _Tertullian_, De Pallio, ch. 3.). As early however as the time\r\nof _Aristotle_ it had been declared a fable by him, Hist. anim., Bk.\r\nVI. ch. 32., and _Clement of Alexandria_ says the same, Paedagog., II.\r\n9. Yet the idea was still cherished at the beginning of the present\r\nCentury at the Cape of Good Hope, see _Corn. de Jong_, “Reise nach dem\r\nVorgebirge der Guten Hoffnung,” (Voyage to the Cape of Good Hope).\r\nHamburg 1803. Pt I. Letter 6. _Clement of Alexandria_, Paedagog., bk.\r\nII. ch. 9., tells a still more remarkable tale of the hare, καὶ τὸν\r\nμὲν λαγῶν κατ’ ἔτεος πλεονεκτεῖν φασὶ τὴν ἀφόδευσιν, εἰς ἀριθμοὺς οἱς\r\nβεβίωκεν ἔτεσιν ἴσχοντα τρυπάς· ταύτῃ ἄρα τὴν κώλυσιν τῆς ἐδωδῆς τοῦ\r\nλαγὼ, παιδεραστίας ἐμφαίνειν ἀποτροπὴν. (Moreover it is said that the\r\nhare gets every year fresh means of voiding its excrement, having holes\r\ncorresponding to the number of years it has lived; and that for this\r\nreason the prohibition against eating hare appears to be a dissuasion\r\nfrom paederastia). This is confirmed by St. Barnabas, Epist., ch. 10.\r\nand by _Pliny_, Hist. Nat., VIII. 55. To this fable also we must look\r\nfor an explanation of the proverbial saying δασύπους κρεῶν ἐπιθυμεῖ\r\n(puss longs for flesh-meats), and Lepus tute es, et pulmentum quaeris?\r\n(Are _you_ a hare, and look for condiments?) in _Terence_, Eunuch.,\r\nIII. 36. Possibly too the κύων τεῦτλα οὐ τρώγει (dog does not gnaw\r\npot-herbs) of Diogenes has a connection with the same notion,—Diogenes\r\nLaertius, VI. 2. 6. So _Strato_ in the distich (_Greek Anthology_ bk.\r\nI. tit. 72. No. 6.):\r\n\r\n     Ἔστι Δράκων τὶς ἔφηβος, ἄγαν καλὸς· ἀλλὰ δράκων ὢν\r\n       Πῶς εἰς τὴν τρώγλην ἄλλον _ὄφιν δέχεται_;\r\n\r\n(A certain youth there is, Draco (serpent) by name, very fair to see;\r\nbut being a serpent, how comes it he _takes another snake_ into his\r\nhole?) _Aristophanes_, Eccles., 904., κἀπὶ τῆς κλίνης _ὄφιν_ εὕροις,\r\n(and on your bed may you find a _snake_), on which the Scholiast\r\ncomments ὄφις—λαμβάνεται ἀντὶ τοῦ αἰδοίου οὐ τεταμένου δηλαδὴ, ἀλλ’\r\nἀνειμένου. (ὄφις—snake: to be taken as meaning the privy member,—not\r\nerect that is, but relaxed). So in the _Priapeia_, LXXXIII. 33., we\r\nfind: licebit aeger, _angue_ lentior (will be reckoned as sick, slacker\r\nthan a snake).\r\n\r\n[365] _Clement of Alexandria_, Paedagog., Bk. II. ch. 10., οὐδὲ τῶν\r\nκατεαγότων, τούτων δὴ τῶν τὴν κιναιδίαν τὴν ἄφωνον ἐπὶ τὰς σκηνὰς\r\nμετιόντων ὀρχηστῶν ἀποῤῥέουσαν εἰς τοσοῦτον ὕβρεως τὴν ἐσθῆτα\r\nπεριορώντων. (nor yet of the debauchees, those dancers I mean that\r\nbring onto the stage cinaedia in pantomime, and suffer their costume to\r\nflow loosely to such a degree of indecency).\r\n\r\n[366] _Naumann_ (Schmidt’s Jahrbuch 1837. Vol. 13. p. 100.) says:\r\nἘναρέες, probably a Scythian word, calls to mind the dwarf _Anar_ or\r\n_Onar_ in the old Northern Mythology,—a eunuch in a sort, but who\r\nwas nevertheless reverenced as father-in-law of Odin. (_J. Grimm_,\r\n“Deutsche Mythologie” (German Mythology). Göttingen 1835. p. 424).\r\nWith this Hippocrates’ statement would agree, according to which these\r\neunuchs were regarded by their countrymen with a reverence almost as\r\nif they had been gods.—As to this, first observe that it yet remains\r\nto be proved that the Scythian language belongs to the Indo-Germanic\r\nfamily, secondly that with Onar or Anar there is no question at all\r\nof a _non-man_ or actual _eunuch_, for Anar _begat a daughter on\r\nNotta_. This daughter, Jördh, was wife of Odin, making Anar Odin’s\r\nfather-in-law.\r\n\r\n[367] Such a corruption of the word on the part of Herodotus is all the\r\nmore likely, as it is clearly established by modern investigations (as\r\nindeed _Heyne_, loco citato, maintained long ago) that he never was in\r\nScythia proper. Comp. _Herodoti Musae_, edit. _J. Ch. F. Baehr_, Vol.\r\nIV. Leipzig 1835., p. 395., and Vol. I. p. 455. _C. G. L. Heyse_,\r\nDe Herodoti vita et intineribus Diss. (Dissertation on the Life and\r\nJourneys of Herodotus). Berlin 1826. 8vo. p. 104.\r\n\r\n[368] Deipnos., bk. XII. p. 530 D.\r\n\r\n[369] _Hesychius does_ give the word ἀνάρσιοι, and explains it\r\nby ἀνάρμοστοι πολέμιοι· ἀπὸ τοῦ μὴ συνηρμοσθῆναι τοῖς ἤθεσιν.\r\n(incompatible foes: from their not being _compatible in character\r\nand disposition_). Plutarch, περὶ τῆς ἐν Τιμαίῳ ψυχογονίας (On the\r\nGeneration of the Soul in Plato’s “Timaeus”) near the end says: οἱ\r\nποιηταὶ καλοῦσιν _ἀναρσίους_ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς καὶ τοὺς πολεμίους, ὡς\r\nἀναρμοστίαν τὴν διαφορὰν οὖσαν. (the poets call _incompatible_ such\r\nas are hostile and at enmity, the difference being irreconcileable).\r\n_Zonaras_, Lexicon, writes: s. v. _ἀνάρσιοι_· ἐχθροί· _ἀδικοί_·\r\nἀνάρμοστοι. (under the word ἀνάρσιοι—incompatible: hostile;\r\n_unjust_; irreconcileable). Similarly the Etymologicum Magnum; s.\r\nv. _ἀνάρσιοι_· ἀδικοὶ, ἐχθροί.—ὁ ἀνάρμοστος καὶ ἀσύμφωνος· Ὦρος·\r\nπολέμιος, _ὑβριστής_· καὶ _ἄναρσις_· νεῖκος, πόλεμος. (under the word\r\nἀνάρσιοι—incompatible: _unjust_, hostile,—one that is irreconcileable,\r\ndiscordant. Orus (the Grammarian) gives: enemy, _overbearing_ man;\r\nalso _ἄναρσις_,—incompatibility: strife, war). According to this we\r\nmight very well read for ἐναρέες ἀνάρσιοι; for the Temple-robbers had\r\nbeen ἄδικοι and ὑβρισταὶ (unjust, overbearing), and were further known\r\nas pathics—whose vice was ἀδικία and ὕβρις (injustice, overbearing\r\nviolence), as we have seen again and again. Another point is that\r\n_Homer_, Iliad XXIV. 365., Odyssey X. 459., uses the expression\r\nἀνάρσιοι in the sense of ὑβρισταὶ, ἄδικοι (overbearing, unjust men),\r\nand this fact was always likely to be of weight with Herodotus, even\r\nwhen he was translating a foreign word. Inasmuch as the word ἀνάρσιοι\r\nhad several meanings, he may very well have added the ἀνδρόγυνοι in the\r\nsecond passage, instead of the καλοῦσι Σκύθαι (the Scythians call it),\r\nin explanation of it.\r\n\r\n[370] Liber quisquis virtuti studet.

I. Halle 1832. pp. 1-12.,\r\nwhere these relations are brought out in detail, and referred back to\r\nanatomical reasons.\r\n\r\n[391] We expressed an opinion above (p. 175.) that no grounds of excuse\r\ncould be found for the Pathic; but we must here modify this so far\r\nas to admit that Aristotle imagines himself to have discovered such.\r\nIn the _Problemata_, IV. 26., he examines the question: διὰ τί ἔνιοι\r\nἀφροδισιαζόμενοι χαίρουσι, καὶ οἱ μὲν ἅμα δρῶντες, οἱ δ’ οὔ; (Why some\r\nmen take pleasure in being loved, and of these some in performing the\r\nact also, but others not?), i.e. why some find a pleasure in suffering\r\npaederastia to be practised with them (the word ἀφροδισιάζεσθαι\r\nis found in this meaning possibly also in _Hippocrates_, edit.\r\nKühn, Vol. III. pp. 680 and 574., where exactly such symptoms of a\r\ncomplaint are described as might serve for an explanation of the\r\nῥέγχειν—snorting (mentioned above), while either they exercise coition\r\nas men concurrently, or do not. As answer we read, to follow the\r\ntranslation given by _Th. Gaza_: An quod excrementis singulis locus\r\ndeterminatus a natura est, in quem instituto secerni naturali debeat,\r\nsollicitaque natura spiritus excurrens tumorem admovet, excrementumque\r\nuna extrudere solet.... His autem proxime genituram quoque in testes\r\net penem deferri constitutum est. _Quibus itaque meatus habitu suo\r\nnaturali privantur, vel quia occoecati sunt qui ad penem tendant,\r\nquod spadonibus hisque similibus evenit_ (οἷς δὲ οἱ πόροι μὴ κατὰ\r\nφύσιν ἔχουσιν, ἀλλ’ ἢ διὰ τὸ ἀποτυφλωθῆναι τοὺς εἰς τὸ αἰδοῖον, οἷον\r\nσυμβαίνει τοῖς _εὐνουχίαις_), vel etiam aliis de causis, his\r\n_talis humor in sedem confluit_ ( εἰς τὴν ἕδραν συῤῥεῖ ἡ τοιαύτη ἰκμας),\r\nquippe qui hac transmeare soleat, quod eius loci contractio in coeundo\r\net partium sedi oppositarum consumptio incidant. Qui si admodum semine\r\ngenitali abundant, _excrementum illud large in eum locum se colligit;\r\nitaque_ cum excitata cupiditas est, _attritum pars ea desiderat_, in\r\nquam confluit excrementum. Cupiditas autem excitari tum a cibo tum\r\nimaginatione potest. Cum enim alterutra de causa libido commota est,\r\nspiritus eodem concurrit, et genus id excrementi confluit, quo secedere\r\nnatum est.... Quorum vera natura mollis et feminea est (οἱ δὲ φύσει\r\nθηλυδρίαι) ita ii constant ut genitura vel nulla vel minima conveniat,\r\nquo illorum secernitur qui praediti natura integra sunt, sed se in\r\npartem sedis divertat; quod propterea evenit quia praeter naturae\r\nnormam constiterunt. Cum enim mares crearentur, ita degenerarunt ut\r\npartem virilem mancam atque oblaesam habere cogerentur, ... ita enim\r\nmulieres non viri crearentur. Ergo perverti citarique aliorsum, quam\r\nsecernendum natura voluit, necesse est. Unde fit ut insatiabiles\r\netiam sint modo mulierum (διὸ καὶ ἄπληστοι, ὥσπερ αἱ γυναῖκες). Humor\r\nenim sollicitans ille exiguus est, nec quicquam se promere conatur,\r\nrefrigeraturque celeriter. _Quibus itaque sedem humor ex toto adiit,\r\nii pati tantummodo avent, quibus autem in utramque partem sese\r\ndispertit, ii et agere et pati concupiunt_ (καὶ ὅσοις μὲν ἐπὶ τὴν\r\nἕδραν, οὗτοι πάσχειν ἐπιθυμοῦσιν· ὅσοις δὲ ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα, οὗτοι καὶ δρᾶν\r\nκαὶ πάσχειν), idque eo amplius quo tandem plenius fluxerit. Sed sunt\r\nquibus vel ex consuetudine affectus hic accidet (ἐνίοις δὲ γίνεται καὶ\r\nἐξ ἔθους  _τὸ πάθος_ τοῦτο). Fit enim ut tam gestiant quam cum agunt,\r\nusque genituram nihilo minus ita emittere valeant. Ergo agere cupiunt,\r\nquibus haec ipsa usu evenerunt et consuetudo magis veluti in naturam\r\niccirco illis evadit, quibus non ante pubem sed in ea vitium patiendi\r\ninvaluit (ἐθισθῶσιν ἀφροδισιάζεσθαι), quoniam his recordatio rei,\r\ncum desiderant, oritur; una autem cum recordatione gestiens exsultat\r\nvoluptas. Desiderant autem perinde ac _nati ad patiendum_ (ὥσπερ\r\nπεφυκότες, ἐπιθυμοῦσι πάσχειν) magna igitur parte vel ob consuetudinem\r\nrex exsistit sed si accidat ut idem et salax et mollis sit (λάγνος ὢν\r\nκαὶ μαλακὸς) longe expeditius haec omnia evenire posse putandum est.\r\n(Is it because for each evacuation a particular locality has been\r\nfixed by nature, to which it must be secreted by the law of its being,\r\nand when effort occurs the spirit issuing out causes a swelling, and\r\nthen pours out the evacuation along with it.—And similarly to these\r\nother secretions, the semen is naturally secreted to the testicles\r\nand private parts. _And accordingly in the case of those in whom the\r\npassages are not in a natural state, either through those that lead to\r\nthe private part being blocked as is the case with eunuchs and those\r\nsimilarly affected to eunuchs_, or through some other circumstance,\r\n_this sort of humour flows to the seat_; for it passes that way, as is\r\nproved by the contraction of this part in the act of coition, and the\r\nwasting of the regions about the seat. Therefore whenever men have an\r\nexcess of lewdness, in their case _it collects in this quarter_, and\r\nso when desire is excited, _that part where it accumulates desires\r\nfriction_. And desire may be excited either by food or mentally; for\r\nwhenever it is stirred by any circumstance, the spirit runs to that\r\nspot, and the particular secretion flows to the particular quarter\r\nnatural to it.—But such as are womanish by nature are so constituted\r\nthat no secretion or only a little occurs in the quarter where the\r\nsecretion takes place with such as are naturally constituted, but to\r\nthis spot (the seat) instead. And the reason is they are not naturally\r\nconstituted, for being males they are yet so framed that of necessity\r\nthe manly part in them is maimed. Now maiming either destroys an organ\r\ncompletely, or produces perversion and deterioration; but here it\r\ncannot be the former; otherwise the patient would be a woman outright.\r\nWherefore it follows that it is perverted and deteriorated, and the\r\nsecretion of semen elsewhere directed. And for this cause they are\r\ninsatiable, like women; for the humour is small in quantity, is not\r\nconstrained to find an issue, and quickly cools. _And those in whom\r\nthe secretion is to the seat, these desire passive pleasure only,\r\nbut those in whom it is both to the seat and to the private parts,\r\nthese desire both active and passive love_; and to whichever part the\r\nsecretion is greater, the more do they desire the corresponding kind\r\nof pleasure. Besides in some cases this occurs through habituation.\r\nWhichever act they do, a pleasurable feeling results, and so they emit\r\nsemen correspondingly. Then they desire to do the act in which this\r\nmost occurs, and thus this becomes in preference their custom, and\r\na sort of second nature. Wherefore such as have been habituated to\r\npassive love not before puberty but about the time of puberty, because\r\nwhen they desire pleasure memory suggests what they must do, and on\r\nmemory follows pleasure, acquire through habituation the desire for\r\npassive gratification _just as if they were born to it_. And if a man\r\nhappen to be lewd and effeminate to begin with, all this results all\r\nthe sooner).—In the Pathic then, according to _Aristotle’s_ view, the\r\nsemen-vessels carry the semen not to the penis, but to the fundament,\r\nand set up there the feeling of desire and sensual craving. These\r\nare the _born Pathics_ (πεφυκότες), from whom he distinguishes the\r\n_seduced_ Pathics, who indulge in the vice as the result of habituation\r\n(ἐξ ἔθους). This is the very same view that we have already (p. 172.\r\nNote 3.) gathered from his Ethics, and which supports in the strongest\r\nway what we there made good as against _Stark_.\r\n\r\n[392] Hippocratis Coi XXII.

Kahn, Vol. I. pp.\r\n561-564.\r\n\r\n[394] For the use of this word, compare _Létronne_, Recherches pour\r\nservir à l’Histoire d’Egypte, (Researches with a view towards a History\r\nof Egypt), pp. 134, 148, 458; and what we have called attention to on\r\nan earlier page in _Hecker’s_ Annalen (Annals), Vol. XXVI. p. 143.\r\n\r\n[395] The word κέδματα, which probably is used in several senses,\r\ncan scarcely in this case betoken anything else than varicose veins,\r\nand is according synonymous with ἰξίαι, with which it also occurs\r\nin connection. It is interesting to find Aristotle also pronouncing\r\nthose suffering from varicose veins incapable of generation; he writes\r\nin Problemata, Bk. IV. 20., Διὰ τί αἱ ἰξίαι τοὺς ἔχοντας κωλύουσι\r\nγεννᾶν, καὶ ἀνθρώπους καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ζώων ὅ, τι ἂν ἔχη; ἢ ὅτι ἡ ἰξία\r\nγίνεται, μεταστάντος; διὸ καὶ ὠφελεῖ πρὸς τὰ μελαγχολικά. Ἔστι δὲ\r\nκαὶ ὁ ἀφροδισιασμὸς μετὰ πνεύματος ἐξόδου. Εἰ οὖν ὁδοποιεῖται ἡ ὁρμὴ\r\nγινομένου αὐτοῦ, οὐ ποιεῖ ὁρμᾶν τὸ σπέρμα, ἀλλὰ καταψύχεται· μαραίνει\r\nοὖν τὴν συντονίαν τοῦ αἰδοίου. (Why varicosities hinder those that have\r\nthem from begetting, both men and of other animals all that are subject\r\nto them? is it because the varicosity arises, through a transference of\r\nspirit; for which reason also it is of use in case of melancholia. But\r\nthe act of love also occurs in conjunction with an outburst of spirit.\r\nIf therefore the impulse is made at the time the varicosity is forming,\r\nit suffers not the seed to make a vigorous impulse, but it is quickly\r\ncooled; and so it wastes and destroys the tension of the private part).\r\nOn the contrary according to Problemata, 31., the lame are lecherous:\r\nδιὰ τ’ αὐτὸ δὲ καὶ οἱ ὄρνιθες _λάγνοι_ και οἱ _χωλοί_· ἡ γὰρ τροφὴ\r\nἀμφοτέροις. κάτω μὲν ὀλίγη, διὰ τὴν ἀναπηρίαν τῶν σκελῶν. (And for the\r\nsame reason birds are lecherous and lame men; because in both cases the\r\nnourishment downwards is slight, on account of the deficiency in the\r\nlegs). In connection with κέδματα we must refer to _Foesius_, Œconomia\r\nHippocratis, _Coray_, loco citato p. 339 sqq., and _Stark_, loco citato\r\nNote 20., and observe that like the Latin _ruptura_ and the English\r\n_rupture_ it appears to specially signify swellings due to distension\r\nand subsequent bursting. That swellings of the groin are a result of\r\nlong-continued riding, we see also from _Livy_, Hist. bk. XLV. ch. 39.,\r\nwhere _M. Servilius_ says: tumorem hunc inguinum in equo dies noctesque\r\npersedendo habeo (this swelling of the groin I have owing to sitting my\r\nhorse nights and days on end). Comp. _Plutarch_, In Aemil., Vol. II. p.\r\n308.\r\n\r\n[396] ἕλκοντα τὰ ἴσχια (they are ulcerated on the hip-joints) is found\r\nin the text. But the meaning of both words is disputed, and by no\r\nmeans fixed so far. With regard to ἰσχία—we must primarily understand\r\nthe mass of muscle at the lower exterior portion of the “os ilium”,\r\nsecondly the whole seat, and the joint-socket (cotyla) of the upper\r\nthigh. This is the interpretation of the _Etymologicon Magnum_;\r\nἰσχία, ὅτι ἴσχει τοὺς καθημένους· σημαίνει δὲ ἰσχίον τὸ ὑπὸ τὴν ὀσφῦν\r\nὀστέον, εἰς ὃ ἔγκειται τὸ ἱερὸν ὀστοῦν, ὅπερ καὶ γλουτὸς καλεῖται, καὶ\r\nκοτύλη, παρὰ τὴν κοιλότητα· ἢ τὸ κοῖλον τοῦ γλουτοῦ, ἐν ᾧ ἡ κοτύλη\r\nστρέφεται.(ἰσχία,—so called because supporting (ἴσχειν) those who\r\nsit; also ἰσχίον signifies the bone below, the loin, on which rests\r\nthe _os sacrum_, which is also called γλουτός (rump), and also κοτύλη\r\n(joint-socket) in reference to its hollowness; or else the hollow of\r\nthe rump, in which the joint-socket turns). Similar is the explanation\r\nof _Suidas_, _Hesychius_, _Zonaras_, the Scholiast on Homer, Iliad,\r\nV. 305, and on Theocritus, VI. 30. The general context shows that the\r\nmeaning of “Joint-socket” is evidently to be preferred here.\r\n\r\n[397] The word διαφθείρεσθαι (ruin themselves) in the text is\r\nundoubtedly written by the author with reference to the ἀνανδρία\r\n(unmanliness). Still it is surprising that what is here pointed out\r\nas injurious is in the Epidem. bk. VI. edit. Kühn, Vol. III. p. 609.\r\nrecommended as salutary. The expression there is: κεδμάτων τὰς ἐν\r\nτοῖσιν ὠσὶν ὄπισθεν φλέβας σχάζειν (in cases of varicose dilatations\r\nto open the veins that are behind in the ears). _Palladius_ in his\r\nCommentary on this passage (edit. Dietz. Vol. II. p. 143.) declares the\r\nwhole sentence wrong, writing: _Πᾶς οὕτος ὁ λόγος ψευδής_· κέδμα γάρ\r\nἐστι διάθεσίς τις περὶ τὴν λαγόνα, ἢ φλεγμονὴ ἢ ῥευματικὴ διάθεσις·\r\nφησὶν οὖν ὅτι καὶ ἐπὶ ταύτῃ τῇ διαθέσει τέμνων τὰς ὄπισθεν φλέβας\r\nὠφελήσεις· καὶ ποία συγγένεια τῆς λαγόνος καὶ τῶν ὤτων, καὶ ταῦτα\r\nτῶν ἐκεῖ ἀγγείων λεπτῶν ὄντων, καὶ τριχοειδῶν καὶ μηδὲν ἀξιόλογον\r\nκενῶσαι δυναμένων; (_All this sentence is wrong_; for κέδμα is really\r\na certain condition of the parts about the flank, either inflammation\r\nor rheumatic condition.) Now they say that in this condition, by cutting\r\nthe veins behind, you will do good; but what connexion is there between\r\nthe flank and the ears, and especially as the vessels there are small,\r\nand like hairs, and not able to void any considerable quantity?).—Not\r\na word is said here about the practice among the Scythians; are we to\r\nsuppose _Palladius_ was ignorant of the fact? Also in the “De Natura\r\nOssium” (Of the Nature of Bones), (edit. Kühn, I. p. 508.) we find\r\nthe operation recommended in pains of the hips, testicles, knees and\r\nknuckles; and according to a passage in the “De Morbis” (Of Diseases),\r\nbk. II. (edit. Kühn, bk. II. p. 223.) these veins should be seared,\r\nuntil they cease to pulsate. On the other hand in the “De Genitura” (Of\r\nGeneration), (edit. Kühn, I. p. 373.) and the “De Locis in Homine” (Of\r\ncertain Localities in the Body), edit. Kühn, II. p. 106.) incapacity\r\nfor generation is represented as a consequence of blood-letting from\r\nthese vessels. We leave to others the task of drawing the necessary\r\nconclusions in view of the unanimity of the Authors of the books named,\r\nand merely observe further that _Dr. Paris_ (Roux Journ. de Med., Vol.\r\nXLIV. p. 355., _Murray_, Med. Pract. Bibliothek., Vol. III. p. 293.)\r\nwhile giving some observations on the diseases of the Turks, relates as\r\nfollowing: Almost every Armenian, Greek, Jew, Turk, has a seton, and\r\nthey abuse cupping to an equal extent. For a simple head-ache, they\r\nallow the first barber they come across to put a bandage round their\r\nthroat, in order to retain the blood, and then with a razor make sundry\r\ncuts round about the ears, for then as much blood flows away, and\r\nwithout risk, as would fill a phial.\r\n\r\n[398] In the text of Froesius it stands: καὶ μᾶλλον τοῖσιν ὀλίγα\r\nκεκτημένοισιν, _οὐ τιμωμένοισιν ἤδη_, εἰ χαίρουσιν οἱ θεοὶ καὶ\r\nθαυμαζόμενοι ὑπ’ ἀνθρώπων, κ. τ. λ. (to a greater extent those who\r\npossess little and therefore fail to make offerings; if that is to say\r\nthe gods take pleasure in being venerated by men, etc). _Coray_ has\r\nemended this into εἰ δὴ τιμώμενοι χαίρουσι (if that is to say the gods\r\ntake pleasure in being honoured and venerated), on the grounds that\r\nτιμᾶν and θαυμάζειν (to honour, to venerate) are frequently used in\r\nconjunction with one another to express the veneration of the gods,\r\nwhich fact he confirms by passages from _Euripides_ and _Aristophanes_.\r\nYet this emendation can scarcely be right, even though _de Mercy_\r\nhas also adopted it. The latest editor, Prof. Petersen of Hamburg, a\r\nprofessed Philologist, has undoubtedly maintained not without weighty\r\nreasons the old reading, noting Coray’s conjecture in the notes. Indeed\r\nneither is the old reading altogether correct, but can be easily\r\nrestored, we think, if the words, as has already been done in our\r\ntranslation above, are read in the following way: οὐ τιμωμένοισιν· εἰ\r\nδὴ χαίρουσιν οἱ θεοὶ θαυμαζόμενοι,—a way of taking it that _Coray_ had\r\nalready seen to be possible, only that he preferred to read instead of\r\nοὐ τιμωμένοισιν,—ἢ τοῖσι τιμωμένοισιν, because he does not think that\r\nthe words can refer at all to the poorer Scythians, as did _Cornarius_\r\nbefore him, though he translates quite correctly: “It affected to a\r\ngreater extent poorer men, as being more negligent concerning the\r\nworship of the gods.” _Foesius_ translates: “and they do not pay\r\nhonour.” In fact Coray’s chief difficulty was as to the active meaning\r\nof τιμωμένοισι (i.e. “paying honour”, not “being honoured”); but this\r\nuse is by no means so rare, and exactly in this sense of veneration\r\npaid to the gods by men is found in _Homer_, Od. XIX. 280, where we\r\nread of the Phaeacians on the occasion of Odysseus’ landing:\r\n\r\n  οἳ δή μιν περὶ κῆρι θεὸν ὣς τιμήσαντο.\r\n\r\n(Now they _honoured_ him from their heart as if he had been a god).\r\nThe whole sense of the passage requires us to refer the words οὐ\r\nτιμωμένοισιν to the poorer Scythians, who possess little, and therefore\r\ncan offer nothing to the gods, and also do not wish to do so, as is\r\nclearly shown in what follows; and it is exactly for this reason that\r\nHippocrates says, then they ought to suffer more from the disease than\r\nthe rich, if the gods practised any system of equivalent returns.\r\n\r\n[399] Ταῦτα δὲ τοῖσί τε Σκύθῃσι πρόσεστι, καὶ _εὐνουχοειδέστατοί_\r\nεἰσι ἀνθρώπων διὰ τὰς προφάσιας, καὶ ὅτι ἀναξυρίδας ἔχουσι ἀεὶ καὶ\r\nεἰσι ἐπὶ τῶν ἵππων τὸ πλεῖστον τοῦ χρόνου, ὥστε μήτε χειρὶ ἅπτεσθαι\r\nτοῦ αἰδοίου, _ὑπό τε τοῦ ψύχεος καὶ τοὺ κόπου ἐπιλήθεσθαι τοῦ ἱμέρου\r\nκαὶ τῆς μίξιος, καὶ μηδὲν παρακινέειν πρότερον ἢ ἀνανδρωθῆναι_.\r\nfor translation see text above: “And this is the case ..., to resign\r\ntheir manly privilege.” We have it is true translated according to\r\nthe text, yet we cannot possibly take this as being uncorrupted,\r\nbut without for the moment being in a position to offer a complete\r\nemendation of it. The sequence of thought, if we are not altogether in\r\nerror, is this: The Scythians ride _continually_, which of its self\r\nweakens their power of generation and desire for coition, then besides\r\nthis they wear trousers, a thing that particularly struck the Greek\r\nbecause he did not use them himself. These trousers were so tight,\r\nthat the wearer could not get at the genitals with his hand; again\r\nthe genitals lay close to the body, did not hang down, could not be\r\nset in motion; at the same time they were also protected against the\r\nwind, so that no cooling process could take place; the idle repose\r\nand the constantly heightened temperature in combination weakened the\r\ngenitals to such a degree that the impulse to coition was at last\r\ntotally lost. Views which entirely agree with our experience of the\r\npresent day, and indeed were by _Faust_, as is notorious, exaggerated\r\nalmost to caricature. Now if Hippocrates has expressed, as is likely\r\nenough, these views in the words ὑπό τε τοῦ ψύχεος καὶ τοῦ κόπου (under\r\nthe influence of cold and lassitude), the text must be corrupt, and\r\nthis is what we wish to insist on. For if by the words we understand\r\nfrost and lassitude, then the first at any rate is impossible; how\r\ncould the Scythians suffer from frost, when they wore trousers! Then\r\nthe cooling process spoken of just now must be intended by ψύχος\r\n(cold)! But if κόπος (striking, beating, so weariness, lassitude) is\r\nunderstood literally, in accordance with its derivation from κόπτω (to\r\nstrike), in the sense of blows, shocks, and taken as referring to the\r\ngenitals, especially the testicles, a negative and a verb must have\r\nbeen lost from the text, and this appears to us too the most probable\r\nexplanation, though at the time we cannot say what verb. The matter\r\nwould be at once decided, if we could translate: so that they could\r\nnot put the hand to the genitals, and since these were encountered\r\nneither by the cooling wind, nor yet by the shock (against the horse’s\r\nback or the saddle), they forgot the desire for coition and coition\r\nitself, i.e. the genitals being neither fortified by the cold nor\r\nyet set in motion, do not remind the Scythians of the fact that they\r\nhave such organs and must use them. The movement (κίνησις) in riding\r\nis at any rate regarded as early as Aristotle (Probl. bk. IV. 12.)\r\nas cause of the greater lasciviousness of those who ride. He asks:\r\nQuare qui equitant libidinosiores evadunt? An caloris agitationisque\r\ncausa eodem afficiuntur modo, quo per coitum. Quocirca aetatis quoque\r\naccessione membra genitalia contrectata agitataque plenius augentur,\r\nquod igitur semper eo utuntur motu qui equitant, hinc fluentiore\r\ncorpore praeparatoque ad concumbendum evadunt. (Why those who ride come\r\nto be more lascivious? Is it that on account of the heat and movement\r\nthey are affected in the same way as by coition? Wherefore as age also\r\nadvances, the genital organs being handled and moved more, are the\r\nmore increased in size, so therefore because those who ride use the\r\nsame movement hence they come to be of a more fluid body and one ready\r\nprepared for sexual intercourse). In Probl. 24. he is investigating\r\nthe causes of the erection of the penis, and says διά τε τὸ βάρος\r\nἐπιγίνεσθαι ἐν τῷ ὄπισθεν τῶν ὄρχεων αἴρεσθαι (now it is on account\r\nof the increase of weight in the hinder part of the testicles that it\r\nis raised). Comp. Probl. 25. _Continual_ riding naturally stimulates\r\nthe impulse, wherefore the Scythians are the first in later times to\r\nbecome ἀνάνδριες (unmanly), and this sooner than other riding nations\r\nbecause they wore trousers. However those who are better informed must\r\ndecide the point!—Finally that in any case ἀνανδρωθῆναι (to be made\r\nunmanly) and not ἀνδρωθῆναι (to be made manly) must be read, any one\r\nwho considers the passage at all carefully must easily see. _Coray’s_\r\nlucubration cannot for a moment convince us.\r\n\r\n[400] Edit. Kühn, Vol. III. p. 218., _μυθολογοῦσι_ δέ τινες ὅτι οἱ\r\nἈμαζονίδες τὸ ἄρσεν γένος το ἑωυτῶν αὐτίκα νήπιον ἐὸν ἐξαρθρέουσιν, αἱ\r\nμὲν κατὰ γούνατα, αἱ δὲ κατὰ τὰ ἰσχία, ὡς δῆθεν χωλὰ γίνοιτο καὶ μὴ\r\nἐπιβουλεύει τὸ ἄῤῥεν γένος τῷ θήλει· χειρώναξιν ἄρα τούτοισι χρέονται,\r\nὁκόσα ἢ σκυτίης ἔργα ἤ χαλκείης ἢ ἄλλο τι ἑδραῖον ἔργον· εἰ μὲν οὖν\r\nἀληθέα ταῦτα ἐστί, ἐγὼ μὲν οὐκ οἶδα. (Now some relate _the myth_ that\r\nthe Amazons dislocate the male sex of their offspring while still quite\r\nyoung, some doing it at the knees, some at the hips, with the avowed\r\nobject of laming them, and so the male sex does not rise in revolt\r\nagainst the female; then they employ them as handicraftsmen, for such\r\ntasks as shoe-making or brassworking or other sedentary occupations.\r\n_But whether this tale is true, I do not know_). _Gardeil_ also in a\r\nwork that is not often met with in Germany, his “Traduction des œuvres\r\nmédicales d’Hippocrate, sur le texte grec, d’après l’édition de Foes”.\r\n(Translation of the Medical Works of Hippocrates,—from the Greek text\r\nof Foesius’ edition.), Vol. I. Toulouse 1801. large 8vo., p. 162.,\r\nsays: “On pourroit induire d’un endroit du traité des articles, à la\r\nfin du numéro 38 (27), que ce qu’Hippocrate rapporte ici concernant\r\nles Scythes, et ce qu’il a dit ci-dessus, numéro 23, au sujet des\r\nSarmates _ne lui étoit connu que par_ une tradition dont il n’étoit pas\r\nbien assuré,” (It might be inferred from a passage in the _Treatise on\r\nJoints_, at the end of no. 38 (27), that what Hippocrates relates here\r\nconcerning the Scythians, and what he had said in a previous passage,\r\nno. 23, of the Sarmatians, _was known to him only by a tradition, the\r\nauthenticity of which he was not well assured of_).\r\n\r\n[401] “Censura Librorum Hippocraticorum”, (Criticism of the Works of\r\nHippocrates), p. 181.\r\n\r\n[402] Epidem., bk.

Kühn, Vol. III. p. 574. it is related\r\nthat the nasal catarrh of Timochares disappeared (ἀφροδισιάσαντι\r\nἐξηράνθη—was dried up after he had indulged in love) after coition\r\n(Paederastia? p. 209.
