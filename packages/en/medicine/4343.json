Then I began to experience more and more off days\r\nwhen I did not feel quite right. I thought I possessed an iron\r\nconstitution. Although I grew a big food garden and ate mostly\r\n\"vegetablitarian\" I thought I could eat anything with impunity. I\r\nhad been fond of drinking beer with my friends while nibbling on\r\nsalty snacks or heavy foods late into the night. And until my health\r\nbegan to weaken I could still get up the next morning after several\r\nhomebrewed beers, feeling good, and would put in a solid day's work.\r\n\r\nWhen my health began to slip I went looking for a cure. Up to that\r\ntime the only use I'd had for doctors was to fix a few traumatic\r\ninjuries. The only preventative health care I concerned myself with\r\nwas to take a multivitamin pill during those rare spells when I felt\r\na bit run down and to eat lots of vegetables. So I'd not learned\r\nmuch about alternative health care.\r\n\r\nNaturally, my first stop was a local general practitioner/MD. He\r\ngave me his usual half-hour get-acquainted checkout and opined that\r\nthere almost certainly was nothing wrong with me. I suspect I had\r\nthe good fortune to encounter an honest doctor, because he also said\r\nif it were my wish he could send me around for numerous tests but\r\nmost likely these would not reveal anything either. More than\r\nlikely, all that was wrong was that I was approaching 40; with the\r\nonset of middle age I would naturally have more aches and pains.\r\n'Take some aspirin and get used to it,' was his advice. 'It'll only\r\nget worse.'\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with his dismal prognosis I asked an energetic old guy\r\nI knew named Paul, an '80-something homesteader who was renowned for\r\nhis organic garden and his good health. Paul referred me to his\r\ndoctor, Isabelle Moser, who at that time was running the Great Oaks\r\nSchool of Health, a residential and out-patient spa nearby at\r\nCreswell, Oregon.\r\n\r\nDr. Moser had very different methods of analysis than the medicos,\r\nwas warmly personal and seemed very safe to talk to. She looked me\r\nover, did some strange magical thing she called muscle testing and\r\nconcluded that I still had a very strong constitution. If I would\r\neliminate certain \"bad\" foods from my diet, eliminate some generally\r\nhealthful foods that, unfortunately, I was allergic to, if I would\r\nreduce my alcohol intake greatly and take some food supplements,\r\nthen gradually my symptoms would abate. With the persistent\r\napplication of a little self-discipline over several months, maybe\r\nsix months, I could feel really well again almost all the time and\r\nwould probably continue that way for many years to come. This was\r\ngood news, though the need to apply personal responsibility toward\r\nthe solution of my problem seemed a little sobering.\r\n\r\nBut I could also see that Dr. Moser was obviously not telling me\r\nsomething. So I gently pressed her for the rest. A little shyly,\r\nreluctantly, as though she were used to being rebuffed for making\r\nsuch suggestions, Isabelle asked me if I had ever heard of fasting?\r\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"I had. Once when I was about twenty and staying at a\r\nfarm in Missouri, during a bad flu I actually did fast, mainly\r\nbecause I was too sick to take anything but water for nearly one\r\nweek.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you ask?\" I demanded.\r\n\r\n\"If you would fast, you will start feeling really good as soon as\r\nthe fast is over.\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Fast? How long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some have fasted for a month or even longer,\" she said. Then she\r\nobserved my crestfallen expression and added, \"Even a couple of\r\nweeks would make an enormous difference.\"\r\n\r\nIt just so happened that I was in between set-up stages for a new\r\nmail-order business I was starting and right then I did have a\r\ncouple of weeks when I was virtually free of responsibility. I could\r\nalso face the idea of not eating for a couple of weeks. \"Okay!\" I\r\nsaid somewhat impulsively. \"I could fast for two weeks. If I start\r\nright now maybe even three weeks, depending on how my schedule works\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nSo in short order I was given several small books about fasting to\r\nread at home and was mentally preparing myself for several weeks of\r\nsevere privation, my only sustenance to be water and herb tea\r\nwithout sweetener. And then came the clinker.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever heard of colonics?\" she asked sweetly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Weird practice, akin to anal sex or something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" she responded. \"Colonics are essential during fasting\r\nor you will have spells when you'll feel terrible. Only colonics\r\nmake water fasting comfortable and safe.\"\r\n\r\nThen followed some explanation about bowel cleansing (and another\r\nlittle book to take home) and soon I was agreeing to get my body\r\nover to her place for a colonic every two or three days during the\r\nfasting period, the first colonic scheduled for the next afternoon.\r\nI'll spare you a detailed description of my first fast with\r\ncolonics; you'll read about others shortly. In the end I withstood\r\nthe boredom of water fasting for 17 days. During the fast I had\r\nabout 7 colonics. I ended up feeling great, much trimmer, with an\r\nenormous rebirth of energy. And when I resumed eating it turned out\r\nto be slightly easier to control my dietary habits and appetites.\r\n\r\nThus began my practice of an annual health-building water fast. Once\r\na year, at whatever season it seemed propitious, I'd set aside a\r\ncouple of weeks to heal my body. While fasting I'd slowly drive\r\nmyself over to Great Oaks School for colonics every other day. By\r\nthe end of my third annual fast in 1981, Isabelle and I had become\r\ngreat friends. About this same time Isabelle's relationship with her\r\nfirst husband, Douglas Moser, had disintegrated. Some months later,\r\nIsabelle and I became partners. And then we married.\r\n\r\nMy regular fasts continued through 1984, by which time I had\r\nrecovered my fundamental organic vigor and had retrained my dietary\r\nhabits. About 1983 Isabelle and I also began using Life Extension\r\nmegavitamins as a therapy against the aging process. Feeling so much\r\nbetter I began to find the incredibly boring weeks of prophylactic\r\nfasting too difficult to motivate myself to do, and I stopped. Since\r\nthat time I fast only when acutely ill. Generally less than one week\r\non water handles any non-optimum health condition I've had since\r\n'84. I am only 54 years old as I write these words, so I hope it\r\nwill be many, many years before I find myself in the position where\r\nI have to fast for an extended period to deal with a serious or\r\nlife-threatening condition.\r\n\r\nI am a kind of person the Spanish call _autodidactico,_ meaning that\r\nI prefer to teach myself. I had already learned the fine art of\r\nself-employment and general small-business practice that way, as\r\nwell as radio and electronic theory, typography and graphic design,\r\nthe garden seed business, horticulture, and agronomy. When Isabelle\r\nmoved in with me she also brought most of Great Oak's extensive\r\nlibrary, including very hard to obtain copies of the works of the\r\nearly hygienic doctors. Naturally I studied her books intensely.\r\n\r\nIsabelle also brought her medical practice into our house. At first\r\nit was only a few loyal local clients who continued to consult with\r\nher on an out-patient basis, but after a few years, the demands for\r\nresidential care from people who were seriously and sometimes\r\nlife-threateningly sick grew irresistibly, and I found myself\r\nsharing our family house with a parade of really sick people. True,\r\nI was not their doctor, but because her residential clients became\r\ntemporary parts of our family, I helped support and encourage our\r\nresidents through their fasting process. I'm a natural teacher (and\r\nhow-to-do-it writer), so I found myself explaining many aspects of\r\nhygienic medicine to Isabelle's clients, while having a first-hand\r\nopportunity to observe for myself the healing process at work. Thus\r\nit was that I became the doctor's assistant and came to practice\r\nsecond-hand hygienic medicine.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, when Isabelle had reached the age of 54, she began to think\r\nabout passing on her life's accumulation of healing wisdom by\r\nwriting a book. She had no experience at writing for the popular\r\nmarket, her only major writing being a Ph.D. dissertation. I on the\r\nother hand had published seven books about vegetable gardening. And\r\nI grasped the essentials of her wisdom as well as any\r\nnon-practitioner could. So we took a summer off and rented a house\r\nin rural Costa Rica, where I helped Isabelle put down her thoughts\r\non a cheap word-processing typewriter. When we returned to the\r\nStates, I fired-up my \"big-mac\" and composed this manuscript into a\r\nrough book format that was given to some of her clients to get what\r\nis trendily called these days, \"feedback.\"\r\n\r\nBut before we could completely finish her book, Isabelle became\r\ndangerously ill and after a long, painful struggle with abdominal\r\ncancer, she died. After I resurfaced from the worst of my grief and\r\nloss, I decided to finish her book. Fortunately, the manuscript\r\nneeded little more than polishing. I am telling the reader these\r\nthings because many ghost-written books end up having little direct\r\nconnection with the originator of the thoughts. Not so in this case.\r\nAnd unlike many ghost writers, I had a long and loving\r\napprenticeship with the author. At every step of our colaboration on\r\nthis book I have made every effort to communicate Isabelle's\r\nviewpoints in the way she would speak, not my own. Dr. Isabelle\r\nMoser was for many years my dearest friend. I have worked on this\r\nbook to help her pass her understanding on.\r\n\r\nMany people consider death to be a complete invalidation of a\r\nhealing arts practitioner. I don't. Coping with her own dicey health\r\nhad been a major motivator for Isabelle's interest in healing\r\nothers. She will tell you more about it in the chapters to come.\r\nIsabelle had been fending off cancer since its first blow up when\r\nshe was 26 years old. I view that 30 plus years of defeating Death\r\nas a great success rather than consider her ultimate defeat as a\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nIsabelle Moser was born in 1940 and died in 1996. I think the\r\ngreatest accomplishment of her 56 years was to meld virtually all\r\navailable knowledge about health and healing into a workable and\r\nmost importantly, a simple model that allowed her to have amazing\r\nsuccess. Her \"system\" is simple enough that even a generally\r\nwell-educated non-medico like me can grasp it. And use it without\r\nconsulting a doctor every time a symptom appears.\r\n\r\nFinally, I should mention that over the years since this book was\r\nwritten I have discovered contains some significant errors of\r\nanatomical or psysiological detail. Most of these happened because\r\nthe book was written \"off the top of Isabelle's head,\" without any\r\nreference materials at hand, not even an anatomy text. I have not\r\nfixed these goofs as I am not even qualified to find them all. Thus,\r\nwhen the reader reads such as 'the pancreas secreates enzymes into\r\nthe stomach,' (actually and correctly, the duodenum) I hope they\r\nwill understand and not invalidate the entire book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter One\r\n\r\nHow I Became a Hygienist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom The Hygienic Dictionary\r\n\r\nDoctors. [1] In the matter of disease and healing, the people have\r\nbeen treated as serfs. The doctor is a dictator who knows it all,\r\nand the people are stupid, dumb, driven cattle, fit for nothing\r\nexcept to be herded together, bucked and gagged when necessary to\r\nforce medical opinion down their throats or under their skins. I\r\nfound that professional dignity was more often pomposity, sordid\r\nbigotry and gilded ignorance. The average physician is a\r\nfear-monger, if he is anything. He goes about like a roaring lion,\r\nseeking whom he may scare to death. _Dr. John. H. Tilden, Impaired\r\nHealth: Its Cause and Cure, Vol. 1, 1921._ [2] Today we are not only\r\nin the Nuclear Age but also the Antibiotic Age. Unhappily, too, this\r\nis the Dark Age of Medicine--an age in which many of my colleagues,\r\nwhen confronted with a patient, consult a volume which rivals the\r\nManhattan telephone directory in size. This book contains the names\r\nof thousands upon thousands of drugs used to alleviate the\r\ndistressing symptoms of a host of diseased states of the body. The\r\ndoctor then decides which pink or purple or baby-blue pill to\r\nprescribe for the patient. This is not, in my opinion, the practice\r\nof medicine. Far too many of these new \"miracle\" drugs are\r\nintroduced with fanfare and then reveled as lethal in character, to\r\nbe silently discarded for newer and more powerful drugs. _Dr. Henry\r\nBieler: Food is Your Best Medicine; 1965._\r\n\r\nI have two reasons for writing this book. One, to help educate the\r\ngeneral public about the virtues of natural medicine. The second, to\r\nencourage the next generation of natural healers. Especially the\r\nsecond because it is not easy to become a natural hygienist; there\r\nis no school or college or licensing board.\r\n\r\nMost AMA-affiliated physicians follow predictable career paths,\r\nstraight well-marked roads, climbing through apprenticeships in\r\nestablished institutions to high financial rewards and social\r\nstatus. Practitioners of natural medicine are not awarded equally\r\nhigh status, rarely do we become wealthy, and often, naturopaths\r\narrive at their profession rather late in life after following the\r\ntangled web of their own inner light. So I think it is worth a few\r\npages to explain how I came to practice a dangerous profession and\r\nwhy I have accepted the daily risks of police prosecution and civil\r\nliability without possibility of insurance.\r\n\r\nSometimes it seems to me that I began this lifetime powerfully\r\npredisposed to heal others. So, just for childhood warm-ups I was\r\nborn into a family that would be much in need of my help. As I've\r\nalways disliked an easy win, to make rendering that help even more\r\ndifficult, I decided to be the youngest child, with two older\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nA pair of big, capable brothers might have guided and shielded me.\r\nBut my life did not work out that way. The younger of my two\r\nbrothers, three years ahead of me, was born with many health\r\nproblems. He was weak, small, always ill, and in need of protection\r\nfrom other children, who are generally rough and cruel. My father\r\nabandoned our family shortly after I was born; it fell to my mother\r\nto work to help support us. Before I was adolescent my older brother\r\nleft home to pursue a career in the Canadian Air Force.\r\n\r\nThough I was the youngest, I was by far the healthiest.\r\nConsequently, I had to pretty much raise myself while my single\r\nmother struggled to earn a living in rural western Canada. This\r\ncircumstance probably reinforced my constitutional predilection for\r\nindependent thought and action. Early on I started to protect my\r\n\"little\" brother, making sure the local bullies didn't take\r\nadvantage of him. I learned to fight big boys and win. I also helped\r\nhim acquire simple skills, ones that most kids grasp without\r\ndifficulty, such as swimming, bike riding, tree climbing, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd though not yet adolescent, I had to function as a responsible\r\nadult in our household. Stressed by anger over her situation and the\r\ndifficulties of earning our living as a country school teacher\r\n(usually in remote one-room schools), my mother's health\r\ndeteriorated rapidly. As she steadily lost energy and became less\r\nable to take care of the home, I took over more and more of the\r\ncleaning, cooking, and learned how to manage her--a person who feels\r\nterrible but must work to survive.\r\n\r\nDuring school hours my mother was able to present a positive\r\nattitude, and was truly a gifted teacher. However, she had a\r\npersonality quirk. She obstinately preferred to help the most able\r\nstudents become even more able, but she had little desire to help\r\nthose with marginal mentalities. This predilection got her into no\r\nend of trouble with local school boards; inevitably it seemed the\r\nDistrict Chairman would have a stupid, badly-behaved child that my\r\nmother refused to cater to. Several times we had to move in the\r\nmiddle of the school year when she was dismissed without notice for\r\n\"insubordination.\" This would inevitably happen on the frigid\r\nCanadian Prairies during mid-winter.\r\n\r\nAt night, exhausted by the day's efforts, my mother's positiveness\r\ndissipated and she allowed her mind to drift into negative thoughts,\r\ncomplaining endlessly about my irresponsible father and about how\r\nmuch she disliked him for treating her so badly. These emotions and\r\ntheir irresponsible expression were very difficult for me to deal\r\nwith as a child, but it taught me to work on diverting someone's\r\nnegative thoughts, and to avoid getting dragged into them myself,\r\nskills I had to use continually much later on when I began to manage\r\nmentally and physically ill clients on a residential basis.\r\n\r\nMy own personal health problems had their genesis long before my own\r\nbirth. Our diet was awful, with very little fresh fruit or\r\nvegetables. We normally had canned, evaporated milk, though there\r\nwere a few rare times when raw milk and free-range fertile farm eggs\r\nwere available from neighbors. Most of my foods were heavily salted\r\nor sugared, and we ate a great deal of fat in the form of lard. My\r\nmother had little money but she had no idea that some of the most\r\nnutritious foods are also the least expensive.\r\n\r\nIt is no surprise to me that considering her nutrient-poor,\r\nfat-laden diet and stressful life, my mother eventually developed\r\nsevere gall bladder problems. Her degeneration caused progressively\r\nmore and more severe pain until she had a cholecystectomy. The\r\ngallbladder's profound deterioration had damaged her liver as well,\r\nseeming to her surgeon to require the removal of half her liver.\r\nAfter this surgical insult she had to stop working and never\r\nregained her health. Fortunately, by this time all her children were\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\nI had still more to overcome. My eldest brother had a nervous\r\nbreakdown while working on the DEW Line (he was posted on the Arctic\r\nCircle watching radar screens for a possible incoming attack from\r\nRussia). I believe his collapse actually began with our childhood\r\nnutrition. While in the Arctic all his foods came from cans. He also\r\nwas working long hours in extremely cramped quarters with no leave\r\nfor months in a row, never going outside because of the cold, or\r\nhaving the benefit of natural daylight.\r\n\r\nWhen he was still in the acute stage of his illness (I was still a\r\nteenager myself) I went to the hospital where my bother was being\r\nheld, and talked the attending psychiatrist into immediately\r\ndischarging him into my care. The physician also agreed to refrain\r\nfrom giving him electroshock therapy, a commonly used treatment for\r\nmental conditions in Canadian hospitals at that time. Somehow I knew\r\nthe treatment they were using was wrong.\r\n\r\nI brought my brother home still on heavy doses of thorazine. The\r\nside effects of this drug were so severe he could barely exist:\r\nblurred vision, clenched jaw, trembling hands, and restless feet\r\nthat could not be kept still. These are common problems with the\r\nolder generation of psycho tropic medications, generally controlled\r\nto some extent with still other drugs like cogentin (which he was\r\ntaking too).\r\n\r\nMy brother steadily reduced his tranquilizers until he was able to\r\nthink and do a few things. On his own he started taking a lot of B\r\nvitamins and eating whole grains. I do not know exactly why he did\r\nthis, but I believe he was following his intuition. (I personally\r\ndid not know enough to suggest a natural approach at that time.) In\r\nany case after three months on vitamins and an improved diet he no\r\nlong needed any medication, and was delighted to be free of their\r\nside effects. He remained somewhat emotionally fragile for a few\r\nmore months but he soon returned to work, and has had no mental\r\ntrouble from that time to this day. This was the beginning of my\r\ninterest in mental illness, and my first exposure to the limitations\r\nof 'modern' psychiatry.\r\n\r\nI always preferred self-discipline to being directed by others. So I\r\ntook every advantage of having a teacher for a mother and studied at\r\nhome instead of being bored silly in a classroom. In Canada of that\r\nera you didn't have to go to high school to enter university, you\r\nonly had to pass the written government entrance exams. At age 16,\r\nnever having spent a single day in high school, I passed the\r\nuniversity entrance exams with a grade of 97 percent. At that point\r\nin my life I really wanted to go to medical school and become a\r\ndoctor, but I didn't have the financial backing to embark on such a\r\nlong and costly course of study, so I settled on a four year nursing\r\ncourse at the University of Alberta, with all my expenses paid in\r\nexchange for work at the university teaching hospital.\r\n\r\nAt the start of my nurses training I was intensely curious about\r\neverything in the hospital: birth, death, surgery, illness, etc. I\r\nfound most births to be joyful, at least when everything came out\r\nall right. Most people died very alone in the hospital, terrified if\r\nthey were conscious, and all seemed totally unprepared for death,\r\nemotionally or spiritually. None of the hospital staff wanted to be\r\nwith a dying person except me; most hospital staff were unable to\r\nconfront death any more bravely than those who were dying. So I made\r\nit a point of being at the death bed. The doctors and nurses found\r\nit extremely unpleasant to have to deal with the preparation of the\r\ndead body for the morgue; this chore usually fell to me also. I did\r\nnot mind dead bodies. They certainly did not mind me!\r\n\r\nI had the most difficulty accepting surgery. There were times when\r\nsurgery was clearly a life saving intervention, particularly when\r\nthe person had incurred a traumatic injury, but there were many\r\nother cases when, though the knife was the treatment of choice, the\r\nresults were disastrous.\r\n\r\nWhenever I think of surgery, my recollections always go to a man\r\nwith cancer of the larynx. At that time the University of Alberta\r\nhad the most respected surgeons and cancer specialists in the\r\ncountry. To treat cancer they invariably did surgery, plus radiation\r\nand chemotherapy to eradicate all traces of cancerous tissue in the\r\nbody, but they seemed to forget there also was a human being\r\nresiding in that very same cancerous body. This particularly\r\nunfortunate man came into our hospital as a whole human being,\r\nthough sick with cancer. He could still speak, eat, swallow, and\r\nlooked normal. But after surgery he had no larynx, nor esophagus,\r\nnor tongue, and no lower jaw.\r\n\r\nThe head surgeon, who, by the way, was considered to be a virtual\r\ngod amongst gods, came back from the operating room smiling from ear\r\nto ear, announcing proudly that he had 'got all the cancer'. But\r\nwhen I saw the result I thought he'd done a butcher's job. The\r\nvictim couldn't speak at all, nor eat except through a tube, and he\r\nlooked grotesque. Worst, he had lost all will to live. I thought the\r\nman would have been much better off to keep his body parts as long\r\nas he could, and die a whole person able to speak, eating if he felt\r\nlike it, being with friends and family without inspiring a gasp of\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nI was sure there must be better ways of dealing with degenerative\r\nconditions such as cancer, but I had no idea what they might be or\r\nhow to find out. There was no literature on medical alternatives in\r\nthe university library, and no one in the medical school ever hinted\r\nat the possibility except when the doctors took jabs at\r\nchiropractors. Since no one else viewed the situation as I did I\r\nstarted to think I might be in the wrong profession.\r\n\r\nIt also bothered me that patients were not respected, were not\r\npeople; they were considered a \"case\" or a \"condition.\" I was\r\nfrequently reprimanded for wasting time talking to patients, trying\r\nto get acquainted. The only place in the hospital where human\r\ncontact was acceptable was the psychiatric ward. So I enjoyed the\r\nrotation to psychiatry for that reason, and decided that I would\r\nlike to make psychiatry or psychology my specialty.\r\n\r\nBy the time I finished nursing school, it was clear that the\r\nhospital was not for me. I especially didn't like its rigid\r\nhierarchical system, where all bowed down to the doctors. The very\r\nfirst week in school we were taught that when entering a elevator,\r\nmake sure that the doctor entered first, then the intern, then the\r\ncharge nurse. Followed by, in declining order of status: graduate\r\nnurses, third year nurses, second year nurses, first year nurses,\r\nthen nursing aids, then orderlies, then ward clerks, and only then,\r\nthe cleaning staff. No matter what the doctor said, the nurse was\r\nsupposed to do it immediately without question--a very military sort\r\nof organization.\r\n\r\nNursing school wasn't all bad. I learned how to take care of all\r\nkinds of people with every variety of illness. I demonstrated for\r\nmyself that simple nursing care could support a struggling body\r\nthrough its natural healing process. But the doctor-gods tended to\r\nbelittle and denigrate nurses. No wonder--so much of nursing care\r\nconsists of unpleasant chores like bed baths, giving enemas and\r\ndealing with other bodily functions.\r\n\r\nI also studied the state-of-the-art science concerning every\r\nconceivable medical condition, its symptoms, and treatment. At the\r\nuniversity hospital nurses were required to take the same pre-med\r\ncourses as the doctors--including anatomy, physiology, biochemistry,\r\nand pharmacology. Consequently, I think it is essential for holistic\r\nhealers to first ground themselves in the basic sciences of the\r\nbody's physiological systems. There is also much valuable data in\r\nstandard medical texts about the digestion, assimilation, and\r\nelimination. To really understand illness, the alternative\r\npractitioner must be fully aware of the proper functioning of the\r\ncardiovascular/pulmonary system, the autonomic and voluntary nervous\r\nsystem, the endocrine system, plus the mechanics and detailed\r\nnomenclature of the skeleton, muscles, tendons and ligaments. Also\r\nit is helpful to know the conventional medical models for treating\r\nvarious disorders, because they do appear to work well for some\r\npeople, and should not be totally invalidated simply on the basis of\r\none's philosophical or religious viewpoints.\r\n\r\nMany otherwise well-meaning holistic practitioners, lacking an\r\nhonest grounding in science, sometimes express their understanding\r\nof the human body in non-scientific, metaphysical terms that can\r\nseem absurd to the well-instructed. I am not denying here that there\r\nis a spiritual aspect to health and illness; I believe there are\r\nenergy flows in and around the body that can effect physiological\r\nfunctioning. I am only suggesting that to discuss illness without\r\nhard science is like calling oneself a abstract artist because the\r\npainter has no ability to even do a simple, accurate\r\nrepresentational drawing of a human figure.\r\n\r\nThough hospital life had already become distasteful to me I was\r\nyoung and poor when I graduated. So after nursing school I buckled\r\ndown and worked just long enough to save enough money to obtain a\r\nmasters degree in Clinical Psychology from the University of British\r\nColumbia. Then I started working at Riverview Hospital in Vancouver,\r\nB.C., doing diagnostic testing, and group therapy, mostly with\r\npsychotic people. At Riverview I had a three-year-long opportunity\r\nto observe the results of conventional psychiatric treatment.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed was the 'revolving door' phenomena. That\r\nis, people go out, and then they're back in, over and over again,\r\ndemonstrating that standard treatment--drugs, electroshock and group\r\ntherapy--had been ineffective. Worse, the treatments given at\r\nRiverside were dangerous, often with long term side effects that\r\nwere more damaging than the disease being treated. It felt like\r\nnursing school all over again; in the core of my being I somehow\r\nknew there was a better way, a more effective way of helping people\r\nto regain their mental health. Feeling like an outsider, I started\r\ninvestigating the hospital's nooks and crannies. Much to my\r\nsurprise, in a back ward, one not open to the public, I noticed a\r\nnumber of people with bright purple skins.\r\n\r\nI asked the staff about this and every one of the psychiatrists\r\ndenied these patients existed. This outright and widely-agreed-upon\r\nlie really raised my curiosity. Finally after pouring through the\r\njournals in the hospital library I found an article describing\r\npsycho tropic-drug-induced disruptions of melanin (the dark skin\r\npigment). Thorazine, a commonly used psychiatric drug, when taken in\r\nhigh doses over a long period of time would do this. Excess melanin\r\neventually was deposited in vital organs such as the heart and the\r\nliver, causing death.\r\n\r\nI found it especially upsetting to see patients receive electroshock\r\ntreatments. These violent, physician-induced traumas did seem to\r\ndisrupt dysfunctional thought patterns such as an impulse to commit\r\nsuicide, but afterwards the victim couldn't remember huge parts of\r\ntheir life or even recall who they were. Like many other dangerous\r\nmedical treatments, electroshock can save life but it can also take\r\nlife away by obliterating identity.\r\n\r\nAccording the Hippocratic Oath, the first criteria of a treatment is\r\nthat it should do no harm. Once again I found myself trapped in a\r\nsystem that made me feel severe protest. Yet none of these\r\nspecialists or university professors, or academic libraries had any\r\ninformation about alternatives. Worse, none of these mind-doctor-gods\r\nwere even looking for better treatments.\r\n\r\nThough unpleasant and profoundly disappointing, my experience as a\r\nmental hospital psychologist was, like being in nursing school, also\r\nvery valuable. Not only did I learn how to diagnose, and evaluate\r\nthe severity of mental illness and assess the dangerousness of the\r\nmentally ill, I learned to understand them, to feel comfortable with\r\nthem, and found that I was never afraid of them. Fearlessness is a\r\nhuge advantage. The mentally ill seem to have a heightened ability\r\nto spot fear in others. If they sense that you are afraid they\r\nfrequently enjoy terrorizing you. When psychotic people know you\r\nfeel comfortable with them, and probably understand a great deal of\r\nwhat they are experiencing, when they know that you can and intend\r\nto control them, they experience a huge sense of relief. I could\r\nalways get mentally ill people to tell me what was really going on\r\nin their heads when no one else could get them to communicate.\r\n\r\nA few years later I married an American and became the Mental Health\r\nCoordinator for Whatcom County, the northwestern corner of\r\nWashington State. I handled all the legal proceedings in the county\r\nfor mentally ill people. After treatment in the state mental\r\nhospital I supervised their reentry into the community, and\r\nattempted to provide some follow up. This work further confirmed my\r\nconclusions that in most cases the mentally ill weren't helped by\r\nconventional treatment. Most of them rapidly became social problems\r\nafter discharge. It seemed the mental hospital's only ethically\r\ndefensible function was incarceration--providing temporary relief\r\nfor the family and community from the mentally ill person's\r\ndestructiveness.\r\n\r\nI did see a few people recover in the mental health system.\r\nInevitably these were young, and had not yet become\r\ninstitutionalized, a term describing someone who comes to like being\r\nin the hospital because confinement feels safe. Hospitalization can\r\nmean three square meals and a bed. It frequently means an\r\nopportunity to have a sex life (many female inmates are highly\r\npromiscuous). Many psychotics are also criminal; the hospital seems\r\nfar better to them than jail. Many chronically mentally ill are also\r\nexperts at manipulating the system. When homeless, they deliberately\r\nget hospitalized for some outrageous deed just before winter. They\r\nthen \"recover\" when the fine weather of spring returns.\r\n\r\nAfter a year as Mental Health Co-ordinator, I had enough of the\r\n\"system\" and decided that it was as good a time as any to return to\r\nschool for a Ph.D., this time at University. of Oregon where I\r\nstudied clinical and counseling psychology and gerontology. While in\r\ngraduate school I became pregnant and had my first child. Not\r\nsurprisingly, this experience profoundly changed my consciousness. I\r\nrealized that it had perhaps been all right for me to be somewhat\r\nirresponsible about my own nutrition and health, but that it was not\r\nokay to inflict poor nutrition on my unborn child. At that time I\r\nwas addicted to salty, deep-fat fried corn chips and a diet pop. I\r\nthought I had to have these so-called foods every day. I tended to\r\neat for taste, in other words, what I liked, not necessarily what\r\nwould give me the best nutrition. I was also eating a lot of what\r\nmost people would consider healthy food: meat, cheese, milk, whole\r\ngrains, nuts, vegetables, and fruits.\r\n\r\nMy constitution had seemed strong and vital enough through my\r\ntwenties to allow this level of dietary irresponsibility. During my\r\nearly 20s I had even recovered from a breast cancer by sheer will\r\npower. (I will discuss this later.) So before my pregnancy I had not\r\nquestioned my eating habits.\r\n\r\nAs my body changed and adapted itself to it's new purpose I began\r\nvisiting the libraries and voraciously read everything obtainable\r\nunder the topic of nutrition--all the texts, current magazines,\r\nnutritional journals, and health newsletters. My childhood habit of\r\nself-directed study paid off. I discovered alternative health\r\nmagazines like Let's Live, Prevention, Organic Gardening, and Best\r\nWays, and promptly obtained every back issue since they were first\r\npublished. Along the way I ran into articles by Linus Pauling on\r\nvitamin C, and sent away for all of his books, one of these was\r\nco-authored with David Hawkins, called The Orthomolecular Approach\r\nto Mental Disorders.\r\n\r\nThis book had a profound effect on me. I instantly recognized that\r\nit was Truth with a capital \"T\", although the orthomolecular\r\napproach was clearly in opposition to the established medical model\r\nand contradicted everything I had ever learned as a student or\r\nprofessional. Here at last was the exciting alternative approach to\r\ntreating mental disorders I had so long sought. I filed this\r\ninformation away, waiting for an opportunity to use it. And I began\r\nto study all the references in The Orthomolecular Approach to Mental\r\nDisorders dealing with correcting the perceptual functioning of\r\npsychotic people using natural substances.\r\n\r\nIn the course of delving through libraries and book stores, I also\r\ncame across the Mokelumne Hill Publishing Company (now defunct).\r\nThis obscure publisher reprinted many unusual and generally crudely\r\nreproduced out-of-print books about raw foods diets, hygienic\r\nmedicine, fruitarianism, fasting, breathairianism, plus some works\r\ndiscussing spiritual aspects of living that were far more esoteric\r\nthan I had ever thought existed. I decided that weird or not, I\r\nmight as well find out everything potentially useful. So I spent a\r\nlot of money ordering their books. Some of Mokelumne Hill's material\r\nreally expanded my thoughts. Though much of it seemed totally\r\noutrageous, in every book there usually was one line, one paragraph,\r\nor if I was lucky one whole chapter that rang true for me.\r\n\r\nRecognizing capital \"T\" Truth when one sees it is one of the most\r\nimportant abilities a person can have. Unfortunately, every aspect\r\nof our mass educational system attempts to invalidate this skill.\r\nStudents are repeatedly told that derivation from recognized\r\nauthority and/or the scientific method are the only valid means to\r\nassess the validity of data. But there is another parallel method to\r\ndetermine the truth or falsehood of information: Knowing. We Know by\r\nthe simple method of looking at something and recognizing its\r\ncorrectness. It is a spiritual ability. I believe we all have it.\r\nBut in my case, I never lost the ability to Know because I almost\r\nnever attended school.\r\n\r\nThus it is that I am absolutely certain How and When to Be Your Own\r\nDoctor will be recognized as Truth by some of my readers and\r\nrejected as unscientific, unsubstantiated, or anecdotal information\r\nby others. I accept this limitation on my ability to teach. If what\r\nyou read in the following pages seems True for you, great! If it\r\ndoesn't, there is little or nothing I could do to further convince.\r\n\r\nI return now to the time of my first pregnancy. In the face of all\r\nthese new Truths I was discovering concerning health and nutrition,\r\nI made immediate changes in my diet. I severely reduced my animal\r\nprotein intake and limited cooked food in general. I began taking\r\nvitamin and mineral supplements. I also choose a highly atypical\r\nPh.D. dissertation topic, \"The Orthomolecular Treatment of Mental\r\nDisorders.\" This fifty cent word, orthomolecular, basically means\r\nreadjusting the body chemistry by providing unusually large amounts\r\nof specific nutrient substances normally found in the human body\r\n(vitamins and minerals). Orthomolecular therapy for mental disorders\r\nis supported by good diet, by removal of allergy-producing\r\nsubstances, by control of hypoglycemia, plus counseling, and\r\nprovision of a therapeutic environment.\r\n\r\nMy proposed dissertation topic met with nothing but opposition. The\r\nprofessors on my doctoral committee had never heard of the word\r\northomolecular, and all of them were certain it wasn't an accepted,\r\ntraditional area of research. Research in academia is supposed to be\r\nbased on the works of a previous researchers who arrived at\r\nhypothesis based on data obtained by strictly following scientific\r\nmethodology. \"Scientific\" data requires control groups, matched\r\npopulations, statistical analysis, etc. In my case there was no\r\nprevious work my dissertation committee would accept, because the\r\navailable data did not originate from a medical school or psychology\r\ndepartment they recognized.\r\n\r\nDue to a lot of determination and perseverance I finally did succeed\r\nin getting my thesis accepted, and triumphed over my doctoral\r\ncommittee. And I graduated with a dual Ph.D. in both counseling\r\npsychology and gerontology. My ambition was to establish the\r\northomolecular approach on the west coast. At that time I knew of\r\nonly two clinics in the world actively using nutritional therapy.\r\nOne was in New York and the other, was a Russian experimental\r\nfasting program for schizophrenics. Doctors Hoffer and Osmond had\r\nused orthomolecular therapy in a Canadian mental hospital as early\r\nas 1950, but they had both gone on to other things.\r\n\r\nThe newly graduated Dr. Isabelle Moser, Ph.D. was at this point\r\nactually an unemployed mother, renting an old, end-of-the-road,\r\nfar-in-the-country farmhouse; by then I had two small daughters. I\r\nstrongly preferred to take care of my own children instead of\r\nturning them over to a baby sitter. My location and my children made\r\nit difficult for me to work any place but at home. So naturally, I\r\nmade my family home into a hospital for psychotic individuals. I\r\nstarted out with one resident patient at a time, using no\r\npsychiatric drugs. I had very good results and learned a tremendous\r\namount with each client, because each one was different and each was\r\nmy first of each type.\r\n\r\nWith any psychotic residing in your home it is foolhardy to become\r\ninattentive even for one hour, including what are normally\r\nconsidered sleeping hours. I have found the most profoundly ill\r\nmentally ill person still to be very crafty and aware even though\r\nthey may appear to be unconscious or nonresponsive. Psychotics are\r\nalso generally very intuitive, using faculties most of us use very\r\nlittle or not at all. For example one of my first patients,\r\nChristine, believed that I was trying to electrocute her. Though she\r\nwould not talk, she repeatedly drew pictures depicting this. She\r\nhad, quite logically within her own reality, decided to kill me with\r\na butcher knife in self-defense before I succeeded in killing her. I\r\nhad to disarm Christine several times, hide all the household\r\nknives, change my sleeping spot frequently, and generally stay\r\nsufficiently awake at night to respond to slight, creaky sounds that\r\ncould indicate the approach of stealthily placed small bare feet.\r\n\r\nWith orthomolecular treatment Christine improved but also became\r\nmore difficult to live with as she got better. For example, when she\r\ncame out of catatonic-like immobility, she became extremely\r\npromiscuous, and was determined to sleep with my husband. In fact\r\nshe kept crawling into bed with him with no clothes on. Either we\r\nhad to forcefully remove her or the bed would be handed over to\r\nher--without a resident man. Christine then decided (logically) that\r\nI was an obstacle to her sex life, and once more set out to kill me.\r\nThis stage also passed, eventually and Christine got tolerably well.\r\n\r\nChristine's healing process is quite typical and demonstrates why\r\northomolecular treatment is not popular. As a psychotic genuinely\r\nimproves, their aberrated behavior often becomes more aggressive\r\ninitially and thus, harder to control. It seems far more convenient\r\nfor all concerned to suppress psychotic behavior with stupefying\r\ndrugs. A drugged person can be controlled when they're in a sort of\r\nperpetual sedation but then, they never get genuinely well, either.\r\n\r\nAnother early patient, Elizabeth, gave me a particularly valuable\r\nlesson, one that changed the direction of my career away from curing\r\ninsanity and toward regular medicine. Elizabeth was a catatonic\r\nschizophrenic who did not speak or move, except for some waxy\r\nposturing. She had to be fed, dressed and pottied. Elizabeth was a\r\npretty little brunette who got through a couple of years of college\r\nand then spent several years in a state mental hospital. She had\r\nrecently run away from a hospital, and had been found wandering\r\naimlessly or standing rigidly, apparently staring fixedly at\r\nnothing. The emergency mental health facility in a small city nearby\r\ncalled me up and asked if I would take her. I said I would, and\r\ndrove into town to pick her up. I found Elizabeth in someone's back\r\nyard staring at a bush. It took me three hours to persuade her to\r\nget in my car, but that effort turned out to be the easiest part of\r\nthe next months.\r\n\r\nElizabeth would do nothing for herself, including going to the\r\nbathroom. I managed to get some nutrition into her, and change her\r\nclothes, but that was about all I could do. Eventually she wore me\r\ndown; I drifted off for an hour's nap instead of watching her all\r\nnight. Elizabeth slipped away in the autumn darkness and vanished.\r\nNeedless to say, when daylight came I desperately searched the\r\nbuildings, the yard, gardens, woods, and even the nearby river. I\r\ncalled in a missing person report and the police looked as well. We\r\nstopped searching after a week because there just wasn't any place\r\nelse to look. Then, into my kitchen, right in front of our round\r\neyes and gaping mouths, walked a smiling, pleasant, talkative young\r\nwoman who was quite sane.\r\n\r\nShe said, \"Hello I'm Elizabeth! I'm sorry I was such a hassle last\r\nweek, and thank you for trying to take care of me so well. I was too\r\nsick to know any better.\" She said she had gone out our back door\r\nthe week before and crawled under a pile of fallen leaves on the\r\nground in our back yard with a black tarp over them. We had looked\r\nunder the tarp at least fifty times during the days past, but never\r\nthought to look under the leaves as well.\r\n\r\nThis amazing occurrence made my head go bong to say the least; it\r\nwas obvious that Elizabeth had not been 'schizophrenic' because of\r\nher genetics, nor because of stress, nor malnutrition, nor\r\nhypoglycemia, nor because of any of the causes of mental illness I\r\nhad previously learned to identify and rectify, but because of food\r\nallergies. Elizabeth was spontaneously cured because she'd had\r\nnothing to eat for a week. The composting pile of leaves hiding her\r\nhad produced enough heat to keep her warm at night and the heap\r\ncontained sufficient moisture to keep her from getting too\r\ndehydrated. She looked wonderful, with clear shiny blue eyes, clear\r\nskin with good color, though she was slightly slimmer than when I\r\nhad last seen her.\r\n\r\nI then administered Coca's Pulse Test (see the Appendix) and quickly\r\ndiscovered Elizabeth was wildly intolerant to wheat and dairy\r\nproducts. Following the well known health gurus of that time like\r\nAdelle Davis, I had self-righteously been feeding her home-made\r\nwhole wheat bread from hand-ground Organic wheat, and home-made\r\ncultured yogurt from our own organically-fed goats. But by doing\r\nthis I had only maintained her insanity. Elizabeth was an\r\nintelligent young woman, and once she understood what was causing\r\nher problems, she had no trouble completely eliminating certain\r\nfoods from her diet. She shuddered at the thought that had she not\r\ncome to my place and discovered the problem, she would probably have\r\ndied on the back ward of some institution for the chronically\r\nmentally ill.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I will always be grateful to her for opening my eyes and\r\nmind a little wider. Elizabeth's case showed me why Russian\r\nschizophrenics put on a 30 day water fast had such a high recovery\r\nrate. I also remembered all the esoteric books I had read extolling\r\nthe benefits of fasting. I also remembered two occasions during my\r\nown youth when I had eaten little or nothing for approximately a\r\nmonth each without realizing that I was \"fasting.\" And doing this\r\nhad done me nothing but good.\r\n\r\nOnce when I was thirteen my mother sent my \"little\" brother and I to\r\na residential fundamentalist bible school. I did not want to go\r\nthere, although my brother did; he had decided he wanted to be a\r\nevangelical minister. I hated bible school because I was allowed\r\nabsolutely no independence of action. We were required to attend\r\nchurch services three times a day during the week, and five services\r\non Sunday. As I became more and more unhappy, I ate less and less;\r\nin short order I wasn't eating at all. The school administration\r\nbecame concerned after I had dropped about 30 pounds in two months,\r\nnotified my mother and sent me home. I returned to at-home\r\nschooling. I also resumed eating.\r\n\r\nI fasted one other time for about a month when I was 21. It happened\r\nbecause I had nothing to do while visiting my mother before\r\nreturning to University except help with housework and prepare\r\nmeals. The food available in the backwoods of central B.C. didn't\r\nappeal to me because it was mostly canned vegetables, canned milk,\r\ncanned moose meat and bear meat stews with lots of gravy and greasy\r\npotatoes. I decided to pass on it altogether. I remember rather\r\nenjoying that time as a fine rest and I left feeling very good ready\r\nto take on the world full force ahead. At that time I didn't know\r\nthere was such a thing as fasting, it just happened that way.\r\n\r\nAfter Elizabeth went on her way, I decided to experimentally fast\r\nmyself. I consumed only water for two weeks. But I must have had\r\ncounter intentions to this fast because I found myself frequently\r\nhaving dreams about sugared plums, and egg omelets, etc. And I\r\ndidn't end up feeling much better after this fast was over (although\r\nI didn't feel any worse either), because I foolishly broke the fast\r\nwith one of my dream omelets. And I knew better! Every book I'd ever\r\nread on fasting stated how important it is to break a fast\r\ngradually, eating only easy-to-digest foods for days or weeks before\r\nresuming one's regular diet.\r\n\r\nFrom this experiment I painfully learned how important it is to\r\nbreak a fast properly. Those eggs just didn't feel right, like I had\r\nan indigestible stone in my belly. I felt very tired after the\r\nomelet, not energized one bit by the food. I immediately cut back my\r\nintake to raw fruits and vegetables while the eggs cleared out of my\r\nsystem. After a few days on raw food I felt okay, but I never did\r\nregain the shine I had achieved just before I resumed eating.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the many fine things about fasting, it allows you to\r\nget in much better communication with your own body, so that you can\r\nhear it when it objects to something you're putting in it or doing\r\nto it. It is not easy to acquire this degree of sensitivity to your\r\nbody unless you remove all food for a sufficiently long period; this\r\nallows the body to get a word in edgewise that we are willing and\r\nable to listen to. Even when we do hear the body protesting, we\r\nfrequently decide to turn a deaf ear, at least until the body starts\r\nproducing severe pain or some other symptom that we can't ignore.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years after Elizabeth's cure I had handily repaired\r\nquite a few mentally ill people in a harmless way no one had heard\r\nof; many new people were knocking at my door wanting to be admitted\r\nto my drug free, home-based treatment program. So many in fact that\r\nmy ability to accommodate them was overwhelmed. I decided that it\r\nwas necessary to move to a larger facility and we bought an old,\r\nsomewhat run-down estate that I called Great Oaks School of Health\r\nbecause of the magnificent oak trees growing in the front yard.\r\n\r\nAt Great Oaks initially I continued working with psychotics,\r\nemploying fasting as a tool, especially in those cases with obvious\r\nfood allergies as identified by Coca's Pulse Test, because it only\r\ntakes five days for a fasting body to eliminate all traces of an\r\nallergic food substance and return to normal functioning. If the\r\nperson was so severely hypoglycemic that they were unable to\r\ntolerate a water fast, an elimination diet (to be described in\r\ndetail later) was employed, while stringently avoiding all foods\r\nusually found to be allergy producing.\r\n\r\nI also decided that if I was going to employ fasting as my primary\r\nmedicine, it was important for me to have a more intense personal\r\nexperience with it, because in the process of reviewing the\r\nliterature on fasting I saw that there were many different\r\napproaches, each one staunchly defended by highly partisan\r\nadvocates. For example, the capital \"N\" Natural, capital \"H\"\r\nHygienists, such a Herbert Shelton, aggressively assert that only a\r\npure water fast can be called a fast. Sheltonites contend that juice\r\nfasting as advocated by Paavo Airola, for example, is not a fast but\r\nrather a modified diet without the benefits of real fasting. Colon\r\ncleansing was another area of profound disagreement among the\r\nauthorities. Shelton strongly insisted that enemas and colonics\r\nshould not be employed; the juice advocates tend to strongly\r\nrecommend intestinal cleansing.\r\n\r\nTo be able to intelligently take a position in this maze of conflict\r\nI decided to first try every system on myself. It seems to me that\r\nif I can be said to really own anything in this life it is my own\r\nbody, and I have the absolute right to experiment with it as long as\r\nI'm not irresponsible about important things such as care of my\r\nkids. I also feel strongly that it was unethical to ask anyone to do\r\nanything that I was not willing or able to do myself. Just imagine\r\nwhat would happen if all medical doctors applied this principal in\r\ntheir practice of medicine, if all surgeons did it too!\r\n\r\nI set out to do a complete and fully rigorous water fast according\r\nto the Natural Hygiene model--only pure water and bed rest (with no\r\ncolon cleansing) until hunger returns, something the hygienists all\r\nassured me would happen when the body had completed its\r\ndetoxification process. The only aspect of a hygienic fast I could\r\nnot fulfill properly was the bed rest part; unfortunately I was in\r\nsole charge of a busy holistic treatment center (and two little\r\ngirls); there were things I had to do, though I did my chores and\r\nduties at a very slow pace with many rest periods.\r\n\r\nI water fasted for 42 days dropping from 135 pounds to 85 pounds on\r\na 5' 7\" frame. At the end I looked like a Nazi concentration camp\r\nvictim. I tended to hide when people came to the door, because the\r\nsight of all my bones scared them to death. Despite my assurances\r\nvisitors assumed I was trying to commit suicide. In any case I\r\npersevered, watching my body change, observing my emotions, my\r\nmental functioning, and my spiritual awareness. I thought, if Moses\r\ncould fast for 42 days so can I, even though the average length of a\r\nfull water fast to skeletal weight for a person that is not\r\noverweight is more in the order of 30 days. I broke the fast with\r\nsmall amounts of carrot juice diluted 50/50 with water and stayed on\r\nthat regimen for two more weeks.\r\n\r\nAfter I resumed eating solid food it took six weeks to regain enough\r\nstrength to be able to run the same distance in the same time I had\r\nbefore fasting, and it took me about six months to regain my\r\nprevious weight. My eyes and skin had become exceptionally clear,\r\nand some damaged areas of my body such as my twice-broken shoulder\r\nhad undergone considerable healing. I ate far smaller meals after\r\nthe fast, but food was so much more efficiently absorbed that I got\r\na lot more miles to the gallon from what I did eat. I also became\r\nmore aware when my body did not want me to eat something. After the\r\nfast, if I ignored my body's protest and persisted, it would\r\nimmediately create some unpleasant sensation that quickly persuaded\r\nme to curb my appetite.\r\n\r\nI later experimented with other approaches to fasting, with juice\r\nfasts, with colon cleansing, and began to establish my own eclectic\r\napproach to fasting and detoxification, using different types of\r\nprograms for different conditions and adjusting for psychological\r\ntolerances. I'll have a lot more to say about fasting.\r\n\r\nAfter my own rigorous fasting experience I felt capable of\r\nsupervising extended fasts on very ill or very overweight people.\r\nGreat Oaks was gradually shifting from being a place that mentally\r\nill people came to regain their sanity to being a spa where anyone\r\nwho wanted to improve their health could come for a few days, some\r\nweeks or even a few months. It had been my observation from the\r\nbeginning that the mentally ill people in my program also improved\r\nremarkably in physical health; it was obvious that my method was\r\ngood for anyone. Even people with good health could feel better.\r\n\r\nBy this time I'd also had enough of psychotic people anyway, and\r\nlonged for sane, responsible company.\r\n\r\nSo people started to come to Great Oaks School of Health to rest up\r\nfrom a demanding job, to drop some excess weight, and generally to\r\neliminate the adverse effects of destructive living and eating\r\nhabits. I also began to get cancer patients, ranging from those who\r\nhad just been diagnosed and did not wish to go the AMA-approved\r\nmedical route of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, to those with\r\nwell-advanced cancer who had been sent home to die after receiving\r\nall of the above treatments and were now ready to give alternative\r\ntherapies a try since they expected to die anyway. I also had a few\r\npeople who were beyond help because their vital organs had been so\r\nbadly damaged that they knew they were dying, and they wanted to die\r\nin peace without medical intervention, in a supportive hospice cared\r\nfor by people who could confront death.\r\n\r\nGreat Oaks School was intentionally named a \"school\" of health\r\npartially to deflect the attentions of the AMA. It is, after all,\r\nentirely legal to teach about how to maintain health, about how to\r\nprevent illness, and how to go about making yourself well once you\r\nwere sick. Education could not be called \"practicing medicine\r\nwithout a license.\" Great Oaks was also structured as a school\r\nbecause I wanted to both learn and teach. Toward this end we started\r\nputting out a holistic health newsletter and offering classes and\r\nseminars to the public on various aspects of holistic health. From\r\nthe early 1970s through the early 1980s I invited a succession of\r\nholistic specialists to reside at GOSH, or to teach at Great Oaks\r\nwhile living elsewhere. These teachers not only provided a service\r\nto the community, but they all became my teachers as well. I\r\napprenticed myself to each one in turn.\r\n\r\nThere came and went a steady parade of alternative practitioners of\r\nthe healing arts and assorted forms of metapsychology:\r\nacupuncturists, acupressurists, reflexologists, polarity therapists,\r\nmassage therapists, postural integrationists, Rolfers, Feldenkries\r\ntherapists, neurolinguistic programmers, biokinesiologists,\r\niridologists, psychic healers, laying on of handsers, past life\r\nreaders, crystal therapists, toning therapists in the person of\r\nPatricia Sun, color therapy with lamps and different colored lenses\r\na la Stanley Bourroughs, Bach Flower therapists, aroma therapists,\r\nherbalists, homeopaths, Tai Chi classes, yoga classes, Arica\r\nclasses, Guergieff and Ouspensky fourth-way study groups, EST\r\nworkshops, Zen Meditation classes. Refugee Lamas from Tibet gave\r\nlectures on The Book of the Dead and led meditation and chanting\r\nsessions, and we held communication classes using Scientology\r\ntechniques. There were anatomy and physiology classes, classes on\r\nnutrition and the orthomolecular approach to treating mental\r\ndisorders (given by me of course); there were chiropractors teaching\r\nadjustment techniques, even first aid classes. And we even had a few\r\nmedical doctors of the alternative ilk who were interested in life\r\nstyle changes as an approach to maintaining health.\r\n\r\nClasses were also offered on colon health including herbs, clays,\r\nenemas, and colonics. So many of my client at Great Oaks were\r\ndemanding colonics in conjunction with their cleansing programs,\r\nthat I took time out to go to Indio, Calif. to take a course in\r\ncolon therapy from a chiropractor, and purchase a state of the art\r\ncolonic machine featuring all the gauges, electric water solenoids\r\nand stainless steel knobs one could ask for.\r\n\r\nDuring this period almost all alternative therapists and their\r\nspecialties were very interesting to me, but I found that most of\r\nthe approaches they advocated did not suit my personality. For\r\nexample, I think that acupuncture is a very useful tool, but I\r\npersonally did not want to use needles. Similarly I thought that\r\nRolfing was a very effective tool but I did not enjoy administering\r\nthat much pain, although a significant number of the clients really\r\nwanted pain. Some of the techniques appealed to me in the beginning,\r\nand I used them frequently with good results but over time I decided\r\nto abandon them, mostly because of a desire to simplify and lighten\r\nup my bag of tricks.\r\n\r\nBecause of my enthusiasm and successes Great Oaks kept on growing.\r\nOriginally the estate served as both the offices of the Holt\r\nAdoption Agency and the Holt family mansion. The Holt family had\r\nconsisted of Harry and Bertha Holt, six of their biological\r\nchildren, and eight adopted Korean orphans. For this reason the ten\r\nthousand square foot two story house had large common rooms, and\r\nlots and lots of bedrooms. It was ideal for housing spa clients and\r\nmy own family. The adjoining Holt Adoption Agency office building\r\nwas also very large with a multitude of rooms. It became living\r\nspace for those helpers and hangers-on we came to refer to as\r\n\"community members.\" My first husband added even more to the\r\nphysical plant constructing a large, rustic gym and workshop.\r\n\r\nMany \"alternative\" people visited and then begged to stay on with\r\nroom and board provided in exchange for their work. A few of these\r\npeople made a significant contribution such as cooking, child care,\r\ngardening, tending the ever-ravenous wood-fired boiler we used to\r\nkeep the huge concrete mansion heated, or doing general cleaning.\r\nBut the majority of the 'work exchangers' did not really understand\r\nwhat work really was, or didn't have sufficient ethical presence to\r\nuphold the principle of fair exchange, which is basically giving\r\nsomething of equal value for getting something of value and, perhaps\r\nmore importantly, giving in exchange what is needed and asked for.\r\n\r\nI also found that community members, once in residence, were very\r\ndifficult to dislodge. My healing services were supporting far too\r\nmuch dead wood. This was basically my own fault, my own poor\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nStill, I learned a great deal from all of this waste. First of all\r\nit is not a genuine service to another human being to give them\r\nsomething for nothing. If a fair exchange is expected and received,\r\npositive ethical behavior is strengthened, allowing the individual\r\nto maintain their self-respect. I also came to realize what an\r\nimportant factor conducting one's life ethically is in the\r\nindividual healing process. Those patients who were out exchange in\r\ntheir relationships with others in one or more areas of their life\r\nfrequently did not get well until they changed these behaviors.\r\n\r\nToward the end of 1982, after providing a decade of services to a\r\ngreat many clients, many of these in critical condition, I reached\r\nto point where I was physically, mentally, and spiritually drained.\r\nI needed a vacation desperately but no one, including my first\r\nhusband, could run Great Oaks in my absence much less cover the\r\nheavy mortgage. So I decided to sell it. This decision stunned the\r\ncommunity members and shocked the clientele who had become dependent\r\non my services. I also got a divorce at this time. In fact I went\r\nthrough quite a dramatic life change in many areas--true to pattern,\r\na classic mid-life crisis. All I kept from these years was my two\r\ndaughters, my life experiences, and far too many books from the\r\nenormous Great Oaks library.\r\n\r\nThese changes were however, necessary for my survival. Any person\r\nwho works with, yes, lives on a day-to-day basis with sick people\r\nand who is constantly giving or outflowing must take time out to\r\nrefill their vessel so that they can give again. Failure to do this\r\ncan result in a serious loss of health, or death. Most healers are\r\nempathic people who feel other peoples' pains and stresses and\r\nsometimes have difficulty determining exactly what is their own\r\npersonal 'baggage' and what belongs to the clients. This is\r\nespecially difficult when the therapy involves a lot of 'hands on'\r\ntechniques.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Great Oaks it took me a couple of years to rest up\r\nenough to want to resume practicing again. This time, instead of\r\ncreating a substantial institution, Steve, my second husband and my\r\nbest friend, built a tiny office next to our family home. I had a\r\nguest room that I would use for occasional residential patients.\r\nUsually these were people I had known from Great Oaks days or were\r\npeople I particularly liked and wanted to help through a life\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nAt the time I am writing this book over ten years have passed since\r\nI sold Great Oaks. I continue to have an active outpatient practice,\r\npreferring to protect the privacy of my home and family life since I\r\nwas remarried by limiting inpatients to a special few who required\r\nmore intensive care, and then, only one at a time, and then, with\r\nlong spells without a resident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Two\r\n\r\nThe Nature and Cause of Disease\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom The Hygienic Dictionary\r\n\r\nToxemia. [1] \"Toxemia is the basic cause of all so-called diseases.\r\nIn the process of tissue-building (metabolism), there is\r\ncell-building (anabolism) and cell destruction (catabolism). The\r\nbroken-down tissue is toxic. In the healthy body (when nerve energy\r\nis normal), this toxic material is eliminated from the blood as fast\r\nas it is evolved. But when nerve energy is dissipated from any cause\r\n(such as physical or mental excitement or bad habits) the body\r\nbecomes weakened or enervated. When the body is enervated,\r\nelimination is checked. This, in turn, results in a retention of\r\ntoxins in the blood--the condition which we speak of as toxemia.\r\nThis state produces a crisis which is nothing more than heroic or\r\nextraordinary efforts by the body to eliminate waste or toxin from\r\nthe blood. It is this crisis which we term disease. Such\r\naccumulation of toxin when once established, will continue until\r\nnerve energy has been restored to normal by removing the cause.\r\nSo-called disease is nature's effort to eliminate toxin from the\r\nblood. All so-called diseases are crises of toxemia.\" _John H.\r\nTilden, M.D., Toxemia Explained._ [2] Toxins are divided into two\r\ngroups; namely exogenous, those formed in the alimentary canal from\r\nfermentation and decomposition following imperfect or faulty\r\ndigestion. If the fermentation is of vegetables or fruit, the toxins\r\nare irritating, stimulating and enervating, but not so dangerous or\r\ndestructive to organic life as putrefaction, which is a fermentation\r\nset up in nitrogenous matter--protein-bearing foods, but\r\nparticularly animal foods. Endogenous toxins are autogenerated. They\r\nare the waste products of metabolism. _Dr. John. H. Tilden, Impaired\r\nHealth: Its Cause and Cure, 1921._\r\n\r\nSuppose a fast-growing city is having traffic jams. \"We don't like\r\nit!\" protest the voters. \"Why are these problems happening?\" asks\r\nthe city council, trying to look like they are doing something about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nExperts then proffer answers. \"Because there are too many cars,\"\r\nsays the Get A Horse Society. The auto makers suggest it is because\r\nthere are uncoordinated traffic lights and because almost all the\r\nbusinesses send their employees home at the same time. Easy to fix!\r\nAnd no reason whatsoever to limit the number of cars. The asphalt\r\nindustry suggests it is because the size and amount of roads is\r\ninadequate.\r\n\r\nWhat do we do then? Tax cars severely until few can afford them?\r\nLegislate opening and closing hours of businesses to stagger to'ing\r\nand fro'ing? Hire a smarter municipal highway engineer to\r\nsynchronize the traffic lights? Build larger and more efficient\r\nstreets? Demand that auto companies make cars smaller so more can\r\nfit the existing roads? Tax gasoline prohibitively, pass out and\r\ngive away free bicycles in virtually unlimited quantities while\r\nsimultaneously building mass rail systems? What? Which?\r\n\r\nWhen we settle on a solution we have simultaneously chosen what we\r\nconsider the real, underlying cause of the problem. If our chosen\r\nreason was the real reason. then our solution results in a real\r\ncure. If we picked wrongly, our attempt at solution may result in no\r\ncure, or create a worse situation than we had before.\r\n\r\nThe American Medical Association style of medicine (a philosophy I\r\nwill henceforth call allopathic) has a model that explains the\r\ncauses of illness. It suggests that anyone who is sick is a victim.\r\nEither they were attacked by a \"bad\" organism--virus, bacteria,\r\nyeast, pollen, cancer cell, etc.--or they have a \"bad\" organ--liver,\r\nkidney, gall bladder, even brain. Or, the victim may also have been\r\ncursed by bad genes. In any case, the cause of the disease is not\r\nthe person and the person is neither responsible for creating their\r\nown complaint nor is the victim capable of making it go away. This\r\ninstitutionalized irresponsibility seems useful for both parties to\r\nthe illness, doctor and patient. The patient is not required to do\r\nanything about their complaint except pay (a lot) and obediently\r\nfollow the instructions of the doctor, submitting unquestioningly to\r\ntheir drugs and surgeries. The physician then acquires a role of\r\nbeing considered vital to the survival of others and thus obtains\r\ngreat status, prestige, authority, and financial remuneration.\r\n\r\nPerhaps because the sick person is seen to have been victimized, and\r\nit is logically impossible to consider a victimizer as anything but\r\nsomething evil, the physician's cure is often violent,\r\nconfrontational. Powerful poisons are used to rejigger body\r\nchemistry or to arrest the multiplication of disease bacteria or to\r\nsuppress symptoms; if it is possible to sustain life without them,\r\n\"bad,\" poorly-functioning organs are cut out.\r\n\r\nI've had a lot of trouble with the medical profession. Over the\r\nyears doctors have made attempts to put me in jail and keep me in\r\nfear. But they never stopped me. When I've had a client die there\r\nhas been an almost inevitable coroner's investigation, complete with\r\ndetectives and the sheriff. Fortunately, I practice in rural Oregon,\r\nwhere the local people have a deeply-held belief in individual\r\nliberty and where the authorities know they would have had a very\r\nhard time finding a jury to convict me. Had I chosen to practice\r\nwith a high profile and had I located Great Oaks School of Health in\r\na major market area where the physicians were able to charge top\r\ndollar, I probably would have spent years behind bars as did other\r\nheroes of my profession such as Linda Hazzard and Royal Lee.\r\n\r\nSo I have acquired an uncomplimentary attitude about medical\r\ndoctors, a viewpoint I am going to share with you ungently, despite\r\nthe fact that doing so will alienate some of my readers. But I do so\r\nbecause most Americans are entirely enthralled by doctors, and this\r\ndoctor-god worship kills a lot of them.\r\n\r\nHowever, before I get started on the medicos, let me state that one\r\narea exists where I do have fundamental admiration for allopathic\r\nmedicine. This is its handling of trauma. I agree that a body can\r\nbecome the genuine victim of fast moving bullets. It can be\r\ninnocently cut, smashed, burned, crushed and broken. Trauma are not\r\ndiseases and modern medicine has become quite skilled at putting\r\ntraumatized bodies back together. Genetic abnormality may be another\r\nundesirable physical condition that is beyond the purview of natural\r\nmedicine. However, the expression of contra-survival genetics can\r\noften be controlled by nutrition. And the expression of poor\r\ngenetics often results from poor nutrition, and thus is similar to a\r\ndegenerative disease condition, and thus is well within the scope of\r\nnatural medicine.\r\n\r\nToday's suffering American public is firmly in the AMA's grip.\r\nPeople have been effectively prevented from learning much about\r\nmedical alternatives, have been virtually brainwashed by clever\r\nmedia management that portrays other medical models as dangerous\r\nand/or ineffective. Legislation influenced by the allopathic\r\ndoctors' union, the American Medical Association, severely limits or\r\nprohibits the practice of holistic health. People are repeatedly\r\ndirected by those with authority to an allopathic doctor whenever\r\nthey have a health problem, question or confusion. Other types of\r\nhealers are considered to be at best harmless as long as they\r\nconfine themselves to minor complaints; at worst, when naturopaths,\r\nhygienists, or homeopaths seek to treat serious disease conditions\r\nthey are called quacks, accused of unlicensed practice of medicine\r\nand if they persist or develop a broad, successful, high-profile and\r\n(this is the very worst) profitable practice, they are frequently\r\njailed.\r\n\r\nEven licensed MDs are crushed by the authorities if they offer\r\nnon-standard treatments. So when anyone seeks an alternative health\r\napproach it is usually because their complaint has already failed to\r\nvanish after consulting a whole series of allopathic doctors. This\r\nhighly unfortunate kind of sufferer not only has a degenerative\r\ncondition to rectify, they may have been further damaged by harsh\r\nmedical treatments and additionally, they have a considerable amount\r\nof brainwashing to overcome.\r\n\r\nThe AMA has succeeded at making their influence over information and\r\nmedia so pervasive that most people do not even realize that the\r\ndoctors' union is the source of their medical outlook. Whenever an\r\nAmerican complains of some malady, a concerned and honestly caring\r\nfriend will demand to know have they yet consulted a medical doctor.\r\nFailure to do so on one's own behalf is considered highly\r\nirresponsible. Concerned relatives of seriously ill adults who\r\ndecline standard medical therapy may, with a great show of\r\nself-righteousness, have the sick person judged mentally incompetent\r\nso that treatment can be forced upon them. When a parent fails to\r\nseek standard medical treatment for their child, the adult may well\r\nbe found guilty of criminal negligence, raising the interesting\r\nissue of who \"owns\" the child, the parents or the State.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly acceptable to die while under conventional medical\r\ncare. Happens all the time, in fact. But holistic alternatives are\r\nrepresented as stupidly risky, especially for serious conditions\r\nsuch as cancer. People with cancer see no choice but to do\r\nchemotherapy, radiation, and radical surgery because this is the\r\ncurrent allopathic medical approach. On some level people may know\r\nthat these remedies are highly dangerous but they have been told by\r\ntheir attending oncologist that violent therapies are their only\r\nhope of survival, however poor that may be. If a cancer victim\r\ndoesn't proceed immediately with such treatment their official\r\nprognosis becomes worse by the hour. Such scare tactics are common\r\namongst the medical profession, and they leave the recipient so\r\nterrified that they meekly and obediently give up all\r\nself-determinism, sign the liability waiver, and submit, no\r\nquestions asked. Many then die after suffering intensely from the\r\ntherapy, long before the so-called disease could have actually\r\ncaused their demise. I will later offer alternative and frequently\r\nsuccessful (but not guaranteed) approaches to treating cancer that\r\ndo not require the earliest-possible detection, surgery or poisons.\r\n\r\nIf holistic practitioners were to apply painful treatments like\r\nallopaths use, ones with such poor statistical outcomes like\r\nallopaths use, there would most certainly be witch hunts and all\r\nsuch irresponsible, greedy quacks would be safely imprisoned. I find\r\nit highly ironic that for at least the past twenty five hundred\r\nyears the basic principle of good medicine has been that the\r\ntreatment must first do no harm. This is such an obvious truism that\r\neven the AMA doctors pledge to do the same thing when they take the\r\nHippocratic Oath. Yet virtually every action taken by the allopath\r\nis a conscious compromise between the potential harm of the therapy\r\nand its potential benefit.\r\n\r\nIn absolute contrast, if a person dies while on a natural hygiene\r\nprogram, they died because their end was inevitable no matter what\r\ntherapy was attempted. Almost certainly receiving hygienic therapy\r\ncontributed to making their last days far more comfortable and\r\nrelatively freer of pain without using opiates. I have personally\r\ntaken on clients sent home to die after they had suffered everything\r\nthe doctors could do to them, told they had only a few days, weeks,\r\nor months to live. Some of these clients survived as a result of\r\nhygienic programs even at that late date. And some didn't. The\r\namazing thing was that any of them survived at all, because the best\r\ntime to begin a hygienic program is as early in the degenerative\r\nprocess as possible, not after the body has been drastically\r\nweakened by invasive and toxic treatments. Later on, I'll tell you\r\nabout some of these cases.\r\n\r\nSomething I consider especially ironic is that when the patient of a\r\nmedical doctor dies, it is inevitably thought that the blessed\r\ndoctor did all that could be done; rarely is any blame laid. If the\r\nphysician was especially careless or stupid, their fault can only\r\nresult in a civil suit, covered by malpractice insurance. But let a\r\nholistic practitioner treat a sick person and have that person\r\nfollow any of their suggestions or take any natural remedies and\r\nhave that person die or worsen and it instantly becomes the natural\r\ndoctor's fault. Great blame is placed and the practitioner faces\r\ninquests, grand juries, manslaughter charges, jail time and civil\r\nsuits that can't be insured against.\r\n\r\nAllopathic medicine rarely makes a connection between the real\r\ncauses of a degenerative or infectious disease and its cure. The\r\ncauses are usually considered mysterious: we don't know why the\r\npancreas is acting up, etc. The sick are sympathized with as victims\r\nwho did nothing to contribute to their condition. The cure is a\r\nhighly technical battle against the illness, whose weapons are\r\ndefined in Latin and far beyond the understanding of a layperson.\r\n\r\nHygienic medicine presents an opposite view. To the naturopath,\r\nillness is not a perplexing and mysterious occurrence over which you\r\nhave no control or understanding. The causes of disease are clear\r\nand simple, the sick person is rarely a victim of circumstance and\r\nthe cure is obvious and within the competence of a moderately\r\nintelligent sick person themselves to understand and help\r\nadminister. In natural medicine, disease is a part of living that\r\nyou are responsible for, and quite capable of handling.\r\n\r\nAsserting that the sick are pitiable victims is financially\r\nbeneficial to doctors. It makes medical intervention seem a vital\r\nnecessity for every ache and pain. It makes the sick become\r\ndependent. I'm not implying that most doctors knowingly are\r\nconniving extortionists. Actually most medical doctors are genuinely\r\nwell-intentioned. I've also noticed that most medical doctors are at\r\nheart very timid individuals who consider that possession of a MD\r\ndegree and license proves that they are very important, proves them\r\nto be highly intelligent, even makes them fully qualified to\r\npontificate on many subjects not related to medicine at all.\r\n\r\nDoctors obtain an enormous sense of self-importance at medical\r\nschool, where they proudly endured the high pressure weeding out of\r\nany free spirit unwilling to grind away into the night for seven or\r\nmore years. Anyone incapable of absorbing and regurgitating huge\r\namounts of rote information; anyone with a disrespectful or\r\nirreverent attitude toward the senior doctor-gods who arrogantly\r\nserve as med school professors, anyone like this was eliminated with\r\nespecial rapidity. When the thoroughly submissive, homogenized\r\nsurvivors are finally licensed, they assume the status of junior\r\ndoctor-gods.\r\n\r\nBut becoming an official medical deity doesn't permit one to create\r\ntheir own methods. No no, the AMA's professional oversight and\r\ncontrol system makes continued possession of the license to practice\r\n(and the high income that usually comes with it) entirely dependent\r\non continued conformity to what is defined by the AMA as \"correct\r\npractice.\" Any doctor who innovates beyond strict limits or uses\r\nnon-standard treatments is in real danger of losing their livelihood\r\nand status.\r\n\r\nNot only are licensed graduates of AMA-sanctioned medical schools\r\nkept on a very tight leash, doctors of other persuasions who use\r\nother methods to heal the sick or help them heal themselves are\r\npersecuted and prosecuted. Extension of the AMA's control through\r\nregulatory law and police power is justified in the name of\r\npreventing quackery and making sure the ignorant and gullible public\r\nreceives only scientifically proven effective medical care.\r\n\r\nThose on the other side of the fence view the AMA's oppression as an\r\neffective way to make sure the public has no real choices but to use\r\nunion doctors, pay their high fees and suffer greatly by\r\nmisunderstanding of the true cause of disease and its proper cure.\r\nIf there are any actual villains responsible for this suppressive\r\ntragedy some of them are to be found in the inner core of the AMA,\r\nofficials who may perhaps fully and consciously comprehend the\r\nsuppressive system they promulgate.\r\n\r\nHygienists usually inform the patient quite clearly and directly\r\nthat the practitioner has no ability to heal them or cure their\r\ncondition and that no doctor of any type actually is able to heal.\r\nOnly the body can heal itself, something it is eager and usually\r\nvery able to do if only given the chance. One pithy old saying among\r\nhygienists goes, \"if the body can't heal itself, nothing can heal\r\nit.\" The primary job of the hygienic practitioner is to reeducate\r\nthe patient by conducting them through their first natural healing\r\nprocess. If this is done well the sick person learns how to get out\r\nof their own body's way and permit its native healing power to\r\nmanifest. Unless later the victim of severe traumatic injury, never\r\nagain will that person need obscenely expensive medical procedures.\r\nHygienists rarely make six figure incomes from regular, repeat\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of hygienic medicine makes it different than almost all\r\nthe others, even most other holistic methods. Hygiene is the only\r\nsystem that does not interpose the assumed healing power of a doctor\r\nbetween the patient and wellness. When I was younger and less\r\nexperienced I thought that the main reason traditional medical\r\npractice did not stress the body's own healing power and represented\r\nthe doctor as a necessary intervention was for profit. But after\r\npracticing for over twenty years I now understand that the last\r\nthing most people want to hear is that their own habits, especially\r\ntheir eating patterns and food choices, are responsible for their\r\ndisease and that their cure is to only be accomplished through\r\ndietary reform, which means unremittingly applied self-discipline.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest things to ask of a person is to change a habit.\r\nThe reason that AMA doctors have most of the patients is they're\r\ngiving the patients exactly what they want, which is to be allowed\r\nto continue in their unconscious irresponsibility.\r\n\r\nThe Cause Of Disease\r\n\r\nEver since natural medicine arose in opposition to the violence of\r\nso-called scientific medicine, every book on the subject of hygiene,\r\nonce it gets past its obligatory introductions and warm ups, must\r\naddress The Cause of Disease. This is a required step because we see\r\nthe cause of disease and its consequent cure in a very different\r\nmanner than the allopath. Instead of many causes, we see one basic\r\nreason why. Instead of many unrelated cures, we have basically one\r\napproach to fix all ills that can be fixed.\r\n\r\nA beautiful fifty cent word that means a system for explaining\r\nsomething is paradigm, pronounced para-dime. I am fond of this word\r\nbecause it admits the possibility of many differing yet equally true\r\nexplanations for the same reality. Of all available paradigms,\r\nNatural Hygiene suits me best and has been the one I've used for\r\nmost of my career.\r\n\r\nThe Natural Hygienist's paradigm for the cause of both degenerative\r\nand infectious disease is called the Theory of Toxemia, or\r\n\"self-poisoning.\"\r\n\r\nBefore explaining this theory it will help many readers if I digress\r\na brief moment about the nature and validity of alternative\r\nparadigms. Not too many decades ago, scientists thought that reality\r\nwas a singular, real, perpetual--that Natural Law existed much as a\r\ntree or a rock existed. In physics, for example, the mechanics of\r\nNewton were considered capital \"T\" True, the only possible paradigm.\r\nAny other view, not being True, was False. There was capital \"N\"\r\nnatural capital \"L\" law.\r\n\r\nMore recently, great uncertainty has entered science; it has become\r\nindisputable that a theory or explanation of reality is only true\r\nonly to the degree it seems to work; conflicting or various\r\nexplanations can all work, all can be \"true.\" At least, this\r\nuncertainty has overtaken the hard, physical sciences. It has not\r\nyet done so with medicine. The AMA is convinced (or is working hard\r\nto convince everyone else) that its paradigm, the allopathic\r\napproach, is Truth, is scientific, and therefore, anything else is\r\nFalsehood, is irresponsibility, is a crime against the sick.\r\n\r\nBut the actual worth or truth of any paradigm is found not in its\r\n\"reality,\" but in its utility. Does an explanation or theory allow a\r\nperson to manipulate experience and create a desired outcome. To the\r\nextent a paradigm does that, it can be considered valuable. Judged\r\nby this standard, the Theory of Toxemia must be far truer than the\r\nhodgepodge of psuedoscience taught in medical schools. Keep that in\r\nmind the next time some officious medical doctor disdainfully\r\ninforms you that Theory of Toxemia was disproven in 1927 by Doctors\r\nJeckel and Hyde.\r\n\r\nWhy People Get Sick\r\n\r\nThis is the Theory of Toxemia. A healthy body struggles continually\r\nto purify itself of poisons that are inevitably produced while going\r\nabout its business of digesting food, moving about, and repairing\r\nitself. The body is a marvelous creation, a carbon, oxygen\r\ncombustion machine, constantly burning fuel, disposing of the waste\r\nproducts of combustion, and constantly rebuilding tissue by\r\nreplacing worn out, dead cells with new, fresh ones. Every seven\r\nyears virtually every cell in the body is replaced, some types of\r\ncells having a faster turnover rate than others, which means that\r\nover a seven year period several hundred pounds of dead cells must\r\nbe digested (autolyzed) and eliminated. All by itself this would be\r\na lot of waste disposal for the body to handle. Added to that waste\r\nload are numerous mild poisons created during proper digestion. And\r\nadded to that can be an enormous burden of waste products created as\r\nthe body's attempts to digest the indigestible, or those tasty items\r\nI've heard called \"fun food.\" Add to that burden the ruinous effects\r\nof just plain overeating.\r\n\r\nThe waste products of digestion, of indigestion, of cellular\r\nbreakdown and the general metabolism are all poisonous to one degree\r\nor another. Another word for this is toxic. If these toxins were\r\nallowed to remain and accumulate in the body, it would poison itself\r\nand die in agony. So the body has a processing system to eliminate\r\ntoxins. And when that system does break down the body does die in\r\nagony, as from liver or kidney failure.\r\n\r\nThe organs of detoxification remove things from the body's system,\r\nbut these two vital organs should not be confused with what\r\nhygienists call the secondary organs of elimination, such as the\r\nlarge intestine, lungs, bladder and the skin, because none of these\r\nother eliminatory organs are supposed to purify the body of toxins.\r\nBut when the body is faced with toxemia, the secondary organs of\r\nelimination are frequently pressed into this duty and the\r\nconsequences are the symptoms we call illness.\r\n\r\nThe lungs are supposed to eliminate only carbon dioxide gas; not\r\nself-generated toxic substances. The large intestine is supposed to\r\npass only insoluble food solids (and some nasty stuff dumped into\r\nthe small intestine by the liver). Skin eliminates in the form of\r\nsweat (which contains mineral salts) to cool the body, but the skin\r\nis not supposed to move toxins outside the system. But when toxins\r\nare flowed out through secondary organs of elimination these areas\r\nbecome inflamed, irritated, weakened. The results can be skin\r\nirritations, sinusitis or a whole host of other \"itises\" depending\r\non the area involved, bacterial or viral infections, asthma. When\r\nexcess toxemia is deposited instead of eliminated, the results can\r\nbe arthritis if toxins are stored in joints, rheumatism if in muscle\r\ntissues, cysts and benign tumors. And if toxins weaken the body's\r\nimmune response, cancer.\r\n\r\nThe liver and the kidneys, the two heroic organs of detoxification,\r\nare the most important ones; these jointly act as filters to purify\r\nthe blood. Hygienists pay a lot of attention to these organs, the\r\nliver especially.\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world, the liver and kidneys would keep up with their\r\njob for 80 years or more before even beginning to tire. In this\r\nideal world, the food would of course, be very nutritious and free\r\nof pesticide residues, the air and water would be pure, people would\r\nnot denature their food and turn it into junk. In this perfect world\r\neveryone would get moderate exercise into old age, and live\r\nvirtually without stress. In this utopian vision, the average\r\nhealthy productive life span would approach a century, entirely\r\nwithout using food supplements or vitamins. In this world doctors\r\nwould have next to no work other than repairing traumatic injuries,\r\nbecause everyone would be healthy. But this is not the way it is.\r\n\r\nIn our less-than-ideal world virtually everything we eat is\r\ndenatured, processed, fried, salted, sweetened, preserved; thus more\r\nstress is placed on the liver and kidneys than nature designed them\r\nto handle. Except for a few highly fortunate individuals blessed\r\nwith an incredible genetic endowment that permits them to live to\r\nage 99 on moose meat, well-larded white flour biscuits, coffee with\r\nevaporated milk and sugar, brandy and cigarettes (we've all heard of\r\nsomeone like this), most peoples' liver and kidneys begin to break\r\ndown prematurely. Thus doctoring has become a financially rewarding\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nMost people overburden their organs of elimination by eating\r\nwhatever they feel like eating whenever they feel like it. Or, they\r\nirresponsibly eat whatever is served to them by a mother, wife,\r\ninstitution or cook because doing so is easy or expected. Eating is\r\na very habitual and unconscious activity; frequently we continue to\r\neat as adults whatever our mother fed us as a child. I consider it\r\nunsurprising that when people develop the very same disease\r\nconditions as their parents. they wrongly assume the cause is\r\ngenetic inheritance, when actually it was just because they were\r\nputting their feet under the same table as their parents.\r\n\r\nToxemia also comes about from following the wrongheaded\r\nrecommendations of allopathic-inspired nutritional texts and\r\nlicensed dietitians. For example, people believe they should eat one\r\nfood from each of the four so-called basic food groups at each meal,\r\nthinking they are doing the right thing for their health by having\r\nfour colors of food on every plate, when they really aren't. What\r\nthey have actually done is force their bodies to attempt the\r\ndigestion of indigestible food combinations, and the resulting\r\nindigestion creates massive doses of toxins. I'll have a lot more to\r\nsay about that later when I discuss the art of food combining.\r\n\r\nTable 1: The Actual Food Groups\r\n\r\nStarches       Proteins          Fats    Sugars       Watery Vegetables\r\nbread          meats             butter  honey        zucchini\r\npotatoes       eggs              oils    fruit        green beans\r\nnoodles        fish              lard    sugar        tomatoes\r\nmanioc/yuca    most nuts         nuts    molassas     peppers\r\nbaked goods    dry beans         avocado malt syrup   eggplant\r\ngrains         nut butters               maple syrup  radish\r\nwinter squash  split peas                dried fruit  rutabaga\r\nparsnips       lentils                   melons       turnips\r\nsweet potatoes soybeans                  carrot juice Brussels sprouts\r\nyams           tofu                      beet juice   celery\r\ntaro root      tempeh                                 cauliflower\r\nplantains      wheat grass juice                      broccoli\r\nbeets          \"green\" drinks                         okra\r\n               spirulina                              lettuce\r\n               algae                                  endive\r\n               yeast                                  cabbage\r\n               dairy                                  carrots\r\n\r\nStandard dietitians divide our foods into four basic food groups\r\nand recommend the ridiculous practice of mixing them at every meal.\r\nThis guarantees indigestion and lots of business for the medical\r\nprofession. This chart illustrates the actual food groups. It is\r\nusually a poor practice to mix different foods from one group with\r\nthose from another.\r\n\r\nThe Digestive Process\r\n\r\nAfter we have eaten our four-color meal--often we do this in a\r\nhurry, without much chewing, under a lot of stress, or in the\r\npresence of negative emotions--we give no thought to what becomes of\r\nour food once it has been swallowed. We have been led to assume that\r\nanything put in the mouth automatically gets digested flawlessly, is\r\nefficiently absorbed into the body where it nourishes our cells,\r\nwith the waste products being eliminated completely by the large\r\nintestine. This vision of efficiency may exist in the best cases but\r\nfor most there is many a slip between the table and the toilet. Most\r\nbodies are not optimally efficient at performing all the required\r\nfunctions, especially after years of poor living habits, stress,\r\nfatigue, and aging. To the Natural Hygienist, most disease begins\r\nand ends with our food; most of our healing efforts are focused on\r\nimproving the process of digestion.\r\n\r\nDigestion means chemically changing the foods we eat into substances\r\nthat can pass into the blood stream and circulate through the body\r\nwhere nutrition is used for bodily functions. Our bodies use\r\nnutritional substances for fuel, for repair and rebuilding, and to\r\nconduct an incredibly complex biochemistry. Scientists are still\r\nbusily engaged in trying to understand the chemical mysteries of our\r\nbodies. But as bewildering as the chemistry of life is, the\r\nchemistry of digestion itself is actually a relatively simple\r\nprocess, and one doctors have had a fairly good understanding of for\r\nmany decades.\r\n\r\nThough relatively straightforward, a lot can and does go wrong with\r\ndigestion. The body breaks down foods with a series of different\r\nenzymes that are mixed with food at various points as it passes from\r\nmouth to stomach to small intestine. An enzyme is a large, complex\r\nmolecule that has the ability to chemically change other large,\r\ncomplex molecules without being changed itself. Digestive enzymes\r\nperform relatively simple functions--breaking large molecules into\r\nsmaller parts that can dissolve in water.\r\n\r\nDigestion starts in the mouth when food is mixed with ptyalin, an\r\nenzyme secreted by the salivary glands. Pylatin converts insoluble\r\nstarches into simple sugars. If the digestion of starchy foods is\r\nimpaired, the body is less able to extract the energy contained in\r\nour foods, while far worse from the point of view of the genesis of\r\ndiseases, undigested starches pass through the stomach and into the\r\ngut where they ferment and thereby create an additional toxic burden\r\nfor the liver to process. And fermenting starches also create gas.\r\n\r\nAs we chew our food it gets mixed with saliva; as we continue to\r\nchew the starches in the food are converted into sugar. There is a\r\nvery simple experiment you can conduct to prove to yourself how this\r\nworks. Get a plain piece of bread, no jam, no butter, plain, and\r\nwithout swallowing it or allowing much of it to pass down the\r\nthroat, begin to chew it until it seems to literally dissolve.\r\nPylatin works fast in our mouths so you may be surprised at how\r\nsweet the taste gets. As important as chewing is, I have only run\r\ninto about one client in a hundred that actually makes an effort to\r\nconsciously chew their food.\r\n\r\nHorace Fletcher, whose name has become synonymous with the\r\nimportance of chewing food well (Fletcherizing), ran an experiment\r\non a military population in Canada. He required half his\r\nexperimental group to chew thoroughly, and the other half to gulp\r\nthings down as usual. His study reports significant improvement in\r\nthe overall health and performance of the group that persistently\r\nchewed. Fletcher's report recommended that every mouthful be chewed\r\n50 times for half a minute before being swallowed. Try it, you might\r\nbe very surprised at what a beneficial effect such a simple change\r\nin your approach to eating can make. Not only will you have less\r\nintestinal gas, if overweight you will probably find yourself\r\ngetting smaller because your blood sugar will elevate quicker as you\r\nare eating and thus your sense of hunger will go away sooner. If you\r\nare very thin and have difficulty gaining weight you may find that\r\nthe pounds go on easier because chewing well makes your body more\r\ncapable of actually assimilating the calories you are consuming.\r\n\r\nA logical conclusion from this data is that anything that would\r\nprevent or reduce chewing would be unhealthful. For example, food\r\neaten when too hot tends to be gulped down. The same tends to happen\r\nwhen food is seasoned with fresh Jalapeno or habaneo peppers.\r\nPeople with poor teeth should blend or mash starchy foods and then\r\ngum them thoroughly to mix them with saliva. Keep in mind that even\r\nso-called protein foods such as beans often contain large quantities\r\nof starches and the starch portion of protein foods is also digested\r\nin the mouth.\r\n\r\nOnce the food is in the stomach, it is mixed with hydrochloric acid,\r\nsecreted by the stomach itself, and pepsin, an enzyme. Together\r\nthese break proteins down into water-soluble amino acids. To\r\naccomplish this the stomach muscles agitate the food continuously,\r\nsomewhat like a washing machine. This extended churning forms a kind\r\nof ball in the stomach called a bolis.\r\n\r\nMany things can and frequently do go wrong at this stage of the\r\ndigestive process. First, the stomach's very acid environment\r\ninactivates pylatin, so any starch not converted to sugar in the\r\nmouth does not get properly processed thereafter. And the most\r\ndangerous misdigetion comes from the sad fact that cooked proteins\r\nare relatively indigestible no matter how strong the constitution,\r\nno matter how concentrated the stomach acid or how many enzymes\r\npresent. It is quite understandable to me that people do not wish to\r\naccept this fact. After all, cooked proteins are so delicious,\r\nespecially cooked red meats and the harder, more flavorful fishes.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate this, consider how those enzymes that digest proteins\r\nwork. A protein molecule is a large, complex string of amino acids,\r\neach linked to the next in a specific order. Suppose there are only\r\nsix amino acids: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So a particular (imaginary)\r\nprotein could be structured: 1, 4, 4, 6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1,\r\n2, 3, etc. Thus you should see that by combining a limited number of\r\namino acids there can be a virtually infinite number of proteins.\r\n\r\nBut proteins are rarely water soluble. As I said a few paragraphs\r\nback, digestion consists of rendering insoluble foods into\r\nwater-soluble substances so they can pass into the blood stream and\r\nbe used by the body's chemistry. To make them soluble, enzymes break\r\ndown the proteins, separating the individual amino acids one from\r\nthe other, because amino acids are soluble. Enzymes that digest\r\nproteins work as though they are mirror images of a particular amino\r\nacid. They fit against a particular amino acid like a key fits into\r\na lock. Then they break the bonds holding that amino acid to others\r\nin the protein chain, and then, what I find so miraculous about this\r\nprocess, the enzyme is capable of finding yet another amino acid to\r\nfree, and then yet another.\r\n\r\nSo with sufficient churning in an acid environment, with enough time\r\n(a few hours), and enough enzymes, all the recently eaten proteins\r\nare decomposed into amino acids and these amino acids pass into the\r\nblood where the body recombines them into structures it wants to\r\nmake. And we have health. But when protein chains are heated, the\r\nprotein structures are altered into physical shapes that the enzymes\r\ncan't \"latch\" on to. The perfect example of this is when an egg is\r\nfried. The eggwhite is albumen, a kind of protein. When it is\r\nheated, it shrivels up and gets hard. While raw and liquid, it is\r\neasily digestable. When cooked, largely indigestable.\r\n\r\nStress also inhibits the churning action in the stomach so that\r\notherwise digestible foods may not be mixed efficiently with\r\ndigestive enzymes. For all these reasons, undigested proteins may\r\npass into the gut.\r\n\r\nAlong with undigested starches. When starches convert best to sugars\r\nunder the alkaline conditions found in the mouth. Once they pass\r\ninto the acid stomach starch digestion is not as efficient. If\r\nstarches reach the small intestine they are fermented by yeasts. The\r\nproducts of starch fermentation are only mildly toxic. The gases\r\nproduced by yeast fermentations usually don't smell particularly\r\nbad; bodies that regularly contain starch fermentation usually don't\r\nsmell particularly bad either. In otherwise healthy people it can\r\ntake many years of exposure to starch fermentation toxins to produce\r\na life-threatening disease.\r\n\r\nBut undigested proteins aren't fermented by yeasts, they putrefy in\r\nthe gut (are attacked by anaerobic bacteria). Many of the waste\r\nproducts of anaerobic putrefaction are highly toxic and evil\r\nsmelling; when these toxins are absorbed through the small or large\r\nintestines they are very irritating to the mucous membranes,\r\nfrequently contributing to or causing cancer of the colon. Protein\r\nputrefaction may even cause psychotic symptoms in some individuals.\r\nMeat eaters often have a very unpleasant body odor even when they\r\nare not releasing intestinal gasses.\r\n\r\nAdding a heavy toxic burden from misdigested foods to the normal\r\ntoxic load a body already has to handle creates a myriad of\r\nunpleasant symptoms, and greatly shortens life. But misdigestion\r\nalso carries with it a double whammy; fermenting and/or putrefying\r\nfoods immediately interfere with the functioning of another vital\r\norgan--the large intestine--and cause constipation.\r\n\r\nMost people don't know what the word constipation really means. Not\r\nbeing able to move one's bowels is only the most elementary type of\r\nconstipation. A more accurate definition of constipation is \"the\r\nretention of waste products in the large intestine beyond the time\r\nthat is conducive to health.\" Properly digested food is not sticky\r\nand exits the large intestine quickly. But improperly digested food\r\n(or indigestible food) gradually coats the large intestine, making\r\nan ever-thicker lining that interferes with the intestine's\r\nfunctioning. Far worse, this coating steadily putrefies, creating\r\nadditional highly-potent toxins. Lining the colon with undigested\r\nfood can be compared to the mineral deposits filling in the inside\r\nof an old water pipe, gradually choking off the flow. In the colon,\r\nthis deposit can become rock-hard, just like water pipe scale.\r\n\r\nSince the large intestine is also an organ that removes moisture and\r\nwater-soluble minerals from the food and moves them into the blood\r\nstream, when the large intestine is lined with putrefying undigested\r\nfood waste, the toxins of this putrefaction are also steadily moved\r\ninto the bloodstream and place an even greater burden on the liver\r\nand kidneys, accelerating their breakdown, accelerating the aging\r\nprocess and contributing to a lot of interesting and unpleasant\r\nsymptoms that keep doctors busy and financially solvent. I'll have\r\nquite a bit more to say about colon cleansing later.\r\n\r\nThe Progress Of Disease: Irritation, Enervation, Toxemia\r\n\r\nDisease routinely lies at the end of a three-part chain that goes:\r\nirritation or sub-clinical malnutrition, enervation, toxemia.\r\nIrritations are something the person does to themselves or something\r\nthat happens around them. Stresses, in other words.\r\n\r\nMental stressors include strong negative emotional states such as\r\nanger, fear, resentment, hopelessness, etc. Behind most diseases it\r\nis common to find a problematic mind churning in profound confusion,\r\none generated by a character that avoids responsibility. There may\r\nalso be job stress or ongoing hostile relationships, often within\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\nIndigestible foods and misdigestion are also stressful irritations,\r\nas are mild recreational poisons such as \"soft\" drugs, tobacco and\r\nalcohol. Opiates are somewhat more toxifying, primarily because they\r\nparalyze the gut and induce profound constipation. Stimulants like\r\ncocaine and amphetamines are the most damaging recreational drugs;\r\nthese are highly toxic and rapidly shorten life.\r\n\r\nRepeated irritations and/or malnutrition eventually produce\r\nenervation. The old-time hygienists defined enervation as a lack of\r\nor decline in an unmeasurable phenomena, \"nerve energy.\" They viewed\r\nthe functioning of vital organs as being controlled by or driven by\r\nnerve force, sometimes called life force or elan vital.\r\nWhatever this vital force actually is, it can be observed and\r\nsubjectively measured by comparing one person with another. Some\r\npeople are full of it and literally sparkle with overflowing energy.\r\nBeings like this make everyone around them feel good because they\r\nsomehow momentarily give energy to those endowed with less. Others\r\npossess very little and dully plod through life.\r\n\r\nAs vital force drops, the overall efficiency of all the body's\r\norgans correspondingly decline. The pancreas creates less digestive\r\nenzymes; the thymus secretes less of its vital hormones that\r\nmobilize the immune system; the pituitary makes less growth hormone\r\nso the overall repair and rebuilding of cells and tissues slows\r\ncorrespondingly; and so forth. It does not really matter if there is\r\nor is not something called nerve energy that can or cannot be\r\nmeasured in a laboratory. Vital force is observable to many people.\r\nHowever, it is measurable by laboratory test that after repeated\r\nirritation the overall functioning of the essential organs and\r\nglands does deteriorate.\r\n\r\nEnervation may develop so gradually that it progresses below the\r\nlevel of awareness of the person, or times of increased enervation\r\ncan be experienced as a complaint--as a lack of energy, as\r\ntiredness, as difficulties digesting, as a new inability to handle a\r\npreviously-tolerated insult like alcohol.\r\n\r\nLong-term consumption of poor-quality food causes enervation. The\r\nbody is a carbon/oxygen engine designed to run efficiently only on\r\nhighly nutritious food and this aspect of human genetic programming\r\ncannot be changed significantly by adaptation. Given enough\r\ngenerations a human gene pool can adapt to extracting its nutrition\r\nfrom a different group of foods. For example, a group of isolated\r\nFijians currently enjoying long healthy lives eating a diet of\r\nseafoods and tropical root crops could suddenly be moved to the\r\nhighlands of Switzerland and forced to eat the local fare or starve.\r\nBut most of the Fijians would not have systems adept at making those\r\nenzymes necessary to digest cows milk. So the transplanted Fijians\r\nwould experience many generations of poorer health and shorter life\r\nspans until their genes had been selected for adaptation to the new\r\ndietary. Ultimately their descendants could become uniformly healthy\r\non rye bread and dairy products just like the highland Swiss were.\r\n\r\nHowever, modern industrial farming and processing of foodstuffs\r\nsignificantly contributes to mass, widespread enervation in two\r\nways. Humans will probably adjust to the first; the second will, I'm\r\nsure, prove insurmountable. First, industrially processed foods are\r\na recent invention and our bodies have not yet adapted to digesting\r\nthem. In a few more generations humans might be able to accomplish\r\nthat and public health could improve on factory food. In the\r\nmeanwhile, the health of humans has declined. Industrially farmed\r\nfoods have also been lowered in nutritional content compared to what\r\nfood could be. I gravely doubt if any biological organism can ever\r\nadapt to an overall dietary that contains significantly lowered\r\nlevels of nutrition. I will explain this more fully in the chapter\r\non diet.\r\n\r\nSecondary Eliminations Are Disease\r\n\r\nHowever the exact form the chain from irritation or malnutrition to\r\nenervation progresses, the ultimate result is an increased level of\r\ntoxemia, placing an eliminatory burden on the liver and kidneys in\r\nexcess of their ability. Eventually these organs begin to weaken.\r\nDecline of liver and/or kidney function threatens the stability and\r\npurity of blood chemistry. Rather than risk complete incapacitation\r\nor death from self-poisoning, the overloaded, toxic body, guided by\r\nits genetic predisposition and the nature of the toxins (what was\r\neaten, in what state of stress), cleverly channels surplus toxins\r\ninto its first line of defense--alternative or secondary elimination\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nMost non-life-threatening yet highly annoying disease conditions\r\noriginate as secondary eliminations. For example, the skin was\r\ndesigned to sweat, elimination of fluids. Toxemia is often pushed\r\nout the sweat glands and is recognized as an unpleasant body odor. A\r\nhealthy, non-toxic body smells sweet and pleasant (like a newborn\r\nbaby's body) even after exercise when it has been sweating heavily.\r\nOther skin-like organs such as the sinus tissues, were designed to\r\nsecrete small amounts of mucus for lubrication. The lungs eliminate\r\nused air and the tissues are lubricated with mucus-like secretions\r\ntoo. These secretions are types of eliminations, but are not\r\nintended for the elimination of toxins. When toxins are discharged\r\nin mucus through tissues not designed to handle them, the tissues\r\nthemselves become irritated, inflamed, weakened and thus much more\r\nsubject to bacterial or viral infection. Despite this danger, not\r\neliminating surplus toxins carries with it the greater penalty of\r\nserious disability or death. Because of this liability, the body, in\r\nits wisdom, initially chooses secondary elimination routes as far\r\nfrom vital tissues and organs as possible. Almost inevitably the\r\nskin or skin-like mucus membranes such as the sinuses, or lung\r\ntissues become the first line of defense.\r\n\r\nThus the average person's disease history begins with colds, flu,\r\nsinusitis, bronchitis, chronic cough, asthma, rashes, acne, eczema,\r\npsoriasis. If these secondary eliminations are suppressed with drugs\r\n(either from the medical doctor or with over the counter remedies),\r\nif the eating or lifestyle habits that created the toxemia are not\r\nchanged, or if the toxic load increases beyond the limits of this\r\ntechnique, the body then begins to store toxins in fat or muscle\r\ntissues or the joint cavities, overburdens the kidneys, creates\r\ncysts, fibroids, and benign tumors to store those toxins. If toxic\r\noverload continues over a longer time the body will eventually have\r\nto permit damages to vital tissues, and life-threatening conditions\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\nHygienic doctors always stress that disease is remedial effort.\r\nIllness comes from the body's best attempt to lighten its toxic load\r\nwithout immediately threatening its survival. The body always does\r\nthe very best it can to remedy toxemia given its circumstances, and\r\nit should be commended for these efforts regardless of how\r\nuncomfortable they might be to the person inhabiting the body.\r\nSymptoms of secondary elimination are actually a positive thing\r\nbecause they are the body's efforts to lessen a dangerously toxic\r\ncondition. Secondary eliminations shouldn't be treated immediately\r\nwith a drug to suppress the process. If you squelch the bodies best\r\nand least-life-threatening method to eliminate toxins, the body will\r\nultimately have to resort to another more dangerous though probably\r\nless immediately uncomfortable channel.\r\n\r\nThe conventional medical model does not view disease this way and\r\nsees the symptoms of secondary elimination as the disease itself. So\r\nthe conventional doctor takes steps to halt the body's remedial\r\nefforts, thus stopping the undesirable symptom and then, the symptom\r\ngone, proclaims the patient cured. Actually, the disease is the\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nA common pattern of symptom suppression under the contemporary\r\nmedical model is this progression: treat colds with antihistamines\r\nuntil the body gets influenza; suppress a flu repeatedly with\r\nantibiotics and eventually you get pneumonia. Or, suppress eczema\r\nwith cortisone ointment repeatedly, and eventually you develop\r\nkidney disease. Or, suppress asthma with bronkiodialators and\r\neventually you need cortisone to suppress it. Continue treating\r\nasthma with steroids and you destroy the adrenals; now the body has\r\nbecome allergic to virtually everything.\r\n\r\nThe presence of toxins in an organ of secondary elimination is\r\nfrequently the cause of infection. Sinuses and lungs, inflamed by\r\nsecondary eliminations, are attacked by viruses or bacteria;\r\ninfectious diseases of the skin result from pushing toxins out of\r\nthe skin. More generalized infections also result from toxemia; in\r\nthis case the immune system has become compromised and the body is\r\noverwhelmed by an organism that it normally should be able to resist\r\neasily. The wise cure of infections is not to use antibiotics to\r\nsuppress the bacteria while simultaneously whipping the immune\r\nsystem; most people, including most medical doctors, do not realize\r\nthat antibiotics also goose the immune system into super efforts.\r\nBut when one chooses to whip a tired horse, eventually the exhausted\r\nanimal collapses and cannot rise again no matter how vigorously it\r\nis beaten. The wise cure is to detoxify the body, a step that\r\nsimultaneously eliminates secondary eliminations and rebuilds the\r\nimmune system.\r\n\r\nThe wise way to deal with the body's eliminative efforts is to\r\naccept that disease is an opportunity to pay the piper for past\r\nindiscretions. You should go to bed, rest, and drink nothing but\r\nwater or dilute juice until the condition has passed. This allows\r\nthe body to conserve its vital energy, direct this energy toward\r\nhealing the disordered body part, and catch up on its waste\r\ndisposal. In this way you can help your body, be in harmony with its\r\nefforts instead of working against it which is what most people do.\r\n\r\nPlease forgive another semi-political polemic here, but in my\r\npractice I have often been amazed to hear my clients complain that\r\nthey have not the time nor the ability to be patient with their\r\nbody, to rest it through an illness because they have a job they\r\ncan't afford to miss or responsibilities they can't put down. This\r\nis a sad commentary on the supposed wealth and prosperity of the\r\nUnited States. In our country most people are enslaved by their\r\ndebts, incurred because they had been enthralled by the illusion of\r\nhappiness secured by the possession of material things. Debt slaves\r\nbelieve they cannot miss a week of work. People who feel they can't\r\nafford to be sick think they can afford to live on pills. So people\r\npush through their symptoms by sheer grit for years on end, and keep\r\nthat up until their exhausted horse of a body breaks down totally\r\nand they find themselves in the hospital running up bills to the\r\ntune of several thousand dollars a day. But these very same people\r\ndo not think they can afford the loss of a few hundred dollars of\r\ncurrent income undertaking some virtually harmless preventative\r\nmaintenance on their bodies.\r\n\r\nGiven half a chance the body will throw off toxic overburdens and\r\ncleanse itself. And once the body has been cleansed of toxemia,\r\ndisagreeable symptoms usually cease. This means that to make\r\nrelatively mild but unwanted symptoms lessen and ultimately stop it\r\nis merely necessary to temporarily cut back food intake, eating only\r\nwhat does not cause toxemia. These foods I classify as cleansing,\r\nsuch as raw fruits and vegetables and their juices. If the symptoms\r\nare extreme, are perceived as overwhelming or are actually\r\nlife-threatening, detoxification can be speeded up by dropping back\r\nto only dilute raw juices or vegetable broth made only from greens,\r\nwithout eating the solids. In the most extreme cases hygienists use\r\ntheir most powerful medicine: a long fast on herb teas, or just\r\nwater. I will have a lot to say about fasting, later.\r\n\r\nWhen acutely ill, the most important thing to do is to just get out\r\nof the body's way, and let it heal itself. In our ignorance we are\r\nusually our own worst enemy in this regard. We have been very\r\nsuccessfully conditioned to think that all symptoms are bad. But I\r\nknow from experience that people can and do learn a new way of\r\nviewing the body, an understanding that puts them at cause over\r\ntheir own body. It allows you to be empowered in one more area of\r\nlife instead of being dependent and at the mercy of other peoples\r\ndecisions about your body.\r\n\r\nFinally, and this is why natural medicine is doubly unpopular, to\r\nprevent the recurrence of toxemia and acute disease states, person\r\nmust discover what they are doing wrong and change their life. Often\r\nas not this means elimination of the person's favorite\r\n(indigestible) foods and/or (stress-producing) bad habits.\r\nNaturally, I will have a lot more to say about this later, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Three\r\n\r\nFasting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom The Hygienic Dictionary\r\n\r\nCure. [1] There is no \"cure\" for disease; fasting is not a cure.\r\nFasting facilitates natural healing processes. Foods do not cure.\r\nUntil we have discarded our faith in cures, there can be no\r\nintelligent approach to the problems presented by suffering and no\r\nproper use of foods by those who are ill. _Herbert Shelton, The\r\nHygienic System, v. 3, Fasting and Sunbathing._ [2] All cure starts\r\nfrom within out and from the head down and in reverse order as the\r\nsymptoms have appeared._ Hering's Law of Cure._ [3] Life is made up\r\nof crises. The individual establishes a standard of health\r\npeculiarly his own, which must vary from all other standards as\r\ngreatly as his personality varies from others. The individual\r\nstandard may be such as to favor the development of indigestion,\r\ncatarrh, gout, rheumatic and glandular inflammations, tubercular\r\ndevelopments, congestions, sluggish secretions and excretions, or\r\ninhibitions of various functions, both mental and physical, wherever\r\nthe environmental or habit strain is greater than usual. The\r\nstandard of resistance may be opposed so strenuously by habits and\r\nunusual physical agencies--that the body breaks down under the\r\nstrain. This is a crisis. Appetite fails, discomfort or pain forces\r\nrest, and, as a result of physiological rest (fasting) and physical\r\nrest (rest from daily work and habits), a readjustment takes place,\r\nand the patient is \"cured.\" This is what the profession and the\r\npeople call a cure, and it is for the time being--until an unusual\r\nenervation is brought on from accident or dissipation; then another\r\ncrisis. These crises are the ordinary sickness of all communities--\r\nall catalogued diseases. When the cold is gone or the hay-fever\r\nfully relieved, it does not mean the patient is cured. Indeed, he\r\nis as much diseased as before he suffered the attack--the\r\ncrisis--and he never will be cured until the habits of life that keep\r\nup toxin poisoning are corrected. To recover from a crisis is not a\r\ncure; the tendency is back to the individual standard; hence all\r\ncrises are self-limited, unless nature by maltreatment is prevented\r\nfrom reacting. All so-called healing systems ride to glory on the\r\nbacks of self-limited crises, and the self-deluded doctors and their\r\ncredulous clients, believe, when the crises are past, that a cure\r\nhas been wrought, whereas the real truth is that the treatment may\r\nhave delayed reaction. This is largely true of anything that has\r\nbeen done except rest. A cure consists in changing the manner of\r\nliving to such a rational standard that full resistance and a\r\nbalanced metabolism is established. I suppose it is not quite human\r\nto expect those of a standardized school of healing to give\r\nutterance to discovered truth which, if accepted by the people,\r\nwould rob them of the glory of being curers of disease. Indeed,\r\nnature, and nature only, cures; and as for crises, they come and go,\r\nwhether or not there is a doctor or healer within a thousand miles.\r\n_Dr. John. H. Tilden, Impaired Health: Its Cause and Cure, 1921._\r\n\r\nThe accelerated healing process that occurs during fasting can\r\nscarcely be believed by a person who has not fasted. No matter how\r\ngifted the writer, the experiential reality of fasting cannot be\r\ncommunicated. The great novelist Upton Sinclair wrote a book about\r\nfasting and it failed to convince the multitudes. But once a person\r\nhas fasted long enough to be certain of what their own body can do\r\nto fix itself, they acquire a degree of independence little known\r\ntoday. Many of those experienced with fasting no longer dread being\r\nwithout health insurance and feel far less need for a doctor or of\r\nhaving a regular checkup. They know with certainty that if something\r\ndegenerates in their body, their own body can fix it by itself.\r\n\r\nLike Upton Sinclair and many others who largely failed before me, I\r\nam going to try to convince you of the virtues of fasting by urging\r\nyou to try fasting yourself. If you will but try you will be changed\r\nfor the better for the rest of your life. If you do not try, you\r\nwill never Know.\r\n\r\nTo prompt your first step on this health-freedom road, I ask you to\r\nplease carefully consider the importance of this fact: the body's\r\nroutine energy budget includes a very large allocation for the daily\r\ndigestion and assimilation of the food you eat. You may find my\r\nestimate surprising, but about one-third of a fairly sedentary\r\nperson's entire energy consumption goes into food processing. Other\r\nuses for the body's energy include the creation or rebuilding of\r\ntissues, detoxification, moving (walking, running, etc.), talking,\r\nproducing hormones, etc. Digestion is one aspect of the body's\r\nefforts that we can readily control, it is the key to having or\r\nlosing health.\r\n\r\nThe Effort Of Digestion\r\n\r\nDigestion is a huge, unappreciated task, unappreciated because few\r\nof us are aware of its happening in the same way we are aware of\r\nmaking efforts to use our voluntary muscles when working or\r\nexercising. Digestion begins in the mouth with thorough chewing. If\r\nyou don't think chewing is effort, try making coleslaw in your own\r\nmouth. Chew up at least half a big head of cabbage and three big\r\ncarrots that have not been shredded. Grind each bit until it\r\nliquefies and has been thoroughly mixed with saliva. I guarantee\r\nthat if you even finish the chore your jaw will be tired and you\r\nwill have lost all desire to eat anything else, especially if it\r\nrequires chewing.\r\n\r\nMaking the saliva you just used while chewing the cabbage is by\r\nitself, a huge and unappreciated chemical effort.\r\n\r\nOnce in the stomach, chewed food has to be churned in order to mix\r\nit with hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and other digestive enzymes.\r\nManufacturing these enzymes is also considerable work! Churning is\r\neven harder work than chewing but normally, people are unaware of\r\nits happening. While the stomach is churning (like a washing\r\nmachine) a large portion of the blood supply is redirected from the\r\nmuscles in the extremities to the stomach and intestines to aid in\r\nthis process. Anyone who has tried to go for a run, or take part in\r\nany other strenuous physical activity immediately after a large meal\r\nfeels like a slug and wonders why they just can't make their legs\r\nmove the way they usually do. So, to assist the body while it is\r\ndigesting, it is wise to take a siesta as los Latinos do instead of\r\nexpecting the blood to be two places at once like los\r\nnorteamericanos.\r\n\r\nAfter the stomach is through churning, the partially digested food\r\nis moved into the small intestine where it is mixed with more\r\npancreatin secreted by the pancreas, and with bile from the gall\r\nbladder. Pancreatin further solubilizes proteins. Bile aids in the\r\ndigestion of fatty foods. Manufacturing bile and pancreatic enzymes\r\nis also a lot of effort. Only after the carbohydrates (starches and\r\nsugars), proteins and fats have been broken down into simpler water\r\nsoluble food units such as simple sugars, amino acids and fatty\r\nacids, can the body pass these nutrients into the blood thorough the\r\nlittle projections in the small intestines called villi.\r\n\r\nThe leftovers, elements of the food that can't be solubilized plus\r\nsome remaining liquids, are passed into the large intestine. There,\r\nwater and the vital mineral salts dissolved in that water, are\r\nextracted and absorbed into the blood stream through thin permeable\r\nmembranes. Mucous is also secreted in the large intestine to\r\nfacilitate passage of the dryish remains. This is an effort.\r\n(Intestinal mucous can become a route of secondary elimination,\r\nespecially during fasting. While fasting, it is essential to take\r\nsteps to expel toxic mucous in the colon before the poisons are re\r\nadsorbed.) The final residue, now called fecal matter, is squeezed\r\nalong the length of the large intestines and passes out the rectum.\r\n\r\nIf all the digestive processes have been efficient there now are an\r\nabundance of soluble nutrients for the blood stream to distribute to\r\nhungry cells throughout the body. It is important to understand the\r\nprocess at least on the level of oversimplification just presented\r\nin order to begin to understand better how health is lost or\r\nregained through eating, digestion, and elimination. And most\r\nimportantly, through not eating.\r\n\r\nHow Fasting Heals\r\n\r\nIts an old hygienic maxim that the doctor does not heal, the\r\nmedicines do not heal, only the body heals itself. If the body can't\r\nheal then nothing can heal it. The body always knows best what it\r\nneeds and what to do.\r\n\r\nBut healing means repairing damaged organs and tissues and this\r\ntakes energy, while a sick body is already enervated, weakened and\r\nnot coping with its current stressors. If the sick person could but\r\nsomehow increase the body's energy resources sufficiently, then a\r\nslowly healing body could heal faster while a worsening one, or one\r\nthat was failing or one that was not getting better might heal.\r\n\r\nFasting does just that. To whatever degree food intake is reduced\r\nthe body's digestive workload is proportionately reduced and it will\r\nnaturally, and far more intelligently than any physician could\r\norder, redirect energy to wherever it decides that energy is most\r\nneeded. A fasting body begins accessing nutritional reserves\r\n(vitamins and minerals) previously stored in the tissues and starts\r\nconverting body fat into sugar for energy fuel. During a time of\r\nwater fasting, sustaining the body's entire energy and nutritional\r\nneeds from reserves and fat does require a small effort, but far\r\nless effort than eating. I would guess a fasting body used about\r\nfive percent of its normal daily energy budget on nutritional\r\nconcerns rather than the 33 percent it needs to process new food.\r\nThus, water fasting puts something like 28 percent more energy at\r\nthe body's disposal. This is true even though the water faster may\r\nfeel weak, energyless.\r\n\r\nI would worry if sick or toxic fasters did not complain about their\r\nweakness. They should expect to feel energyless. In fact, the more\r\ninternal healing and detoxification the body requires, the tireder\r\nthe faster feels because the body is very hard at work internally. A\r\ngreat deal of the body's energy will go toward boosting the immune\r\nsystem if the problem is an infection. Liberated energy can also be\r\nused for healing damaged parts, rebuilding failing organs, for\r\nbreaking down and eliminating deposits of toxic materials. Only\r\nafter most of the healing has occurred does a faster begin to feel\r\nenergetic again. Don't expect to feel anything but tired and weak.\r\n\r\nThe only exception to this would be a person who has already\r\nsignificantly detoxified and healed their body by previous fasting,\r\nor the rare soul that has gone from birth through adulthood enjoying\r\nextraordinarily good nutrition and without experiencing the\r\nstressors of improper digestion. When one experienced faster I know\r\nfinds himself getting \"run down\" or catching a cold, he quits eating\r\nuntil he feels really well. Instead of feeling weak as most fasters\r\ndo, as each of the first four or five days of water fasting pass, he\r\nexperiences a resurgence of more and more energy. On the first\r\nfasting day he would usually feel rotten, which was why he started\r\nfasting in the first place. On the second fasting day he'd feel more\r\nalert and catch up on his paper work. By his third day on only water\r\nhe would be out doing hard physical chores like cutting the grass,\r\nsplitting wood or weeding his vegetable garden. Day four would also\r\nbe an energetic one, but if the fast extended beyond that, lowering\r\nblood sugar would begin to make him tired and he'd feel forced to\r\nbegin laying down.\r\n\r\nAfter a day of water fasting the average person's blood sugar level\r\nnaturally drops; making a faster feel somewhat tired and \"spacey,\"\r\nso a typical faster usually begins to spend much more time resting,\r\nfurther reducing the amount of energy being expended on moving the\r\nbody around, serendipitously redirecting even more of the body's\r\nenergy budget toward healing. By the end of five or six days on\r\nwater, I estimate that from 40 to 50 percent of the body's available\r\nenergy is being used for healing, repair and detoxification.\r\n\r\nThe amount of work that a fasting body's own healing energy can do\r\nand what it feels like to be there when it is happening is\r\nincredible. But you can't know it if you haven't felt it. So hardly\r\nanyone in our present culture knows.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in the first chapter, at Great Oaks School I\r\napprenticed myself to the traveling masters of virtually every\r\nsystem of natural healing that existed during the '70s. I observed\r\nevery one of them at work and tried most of them on my clients.\r\nAfter all that I can say with experience that I am not aware of any\r\nother healing tool that can be so effective as the fast.\r\n\r\nEssentials of a Successful, Safe Fast\r\n\r\n1. Fast in a bright airy room, with exceptionally good ventilation,\r\nbecause fasters not only need a lot of fresh air; their bodies give\r\noff powerfully offensive odors. 2. Sun bathe if possible in warm\r\nclimates for 10 to 20 minutes in the morning before the sun gets too\r\nstrong. 3. Scrub/massage the skin with a dry brush, stroking toward\r\nthe heart, followed by a warm water shower two to four times a day\r\nto assist the skin in eliminating toxins. If you are too weak to do\r\nthis, have an assisted bed bath. 4. Have two enemas daily for the\r\nfirst week of a fast and then once daily until the fast is\r\nterminated. 5. Insure a harmonious environment with supportive\r\npeople or else fast alone if you are experienced. Avoid well-meaning\r\ninterference or anxious criticism at all cost. The faster becomes\r\nhypersensitive to others' emotions. 6. Rest profoundly except for a\r\nshort walk of about 200 yards morning and night. 7. Drink water! At\r\nleast three quarts every day. Do not allow yourself to become\r\ndehydrated! 8. Control yourself! Break a long fast on diluted\r\nnon-sweet fruit juice such as grapefruit juice, sipped a teaspoon at\r\na time, no more than eight ounces at a time no oftener than every 2\r\nor 3 hours. The second day you eat, add small quantities of fresh\r\njuicy fruit to the same amount of juice you took the day before no\r\noftener than every 3 hours. By small quantities I mean half an apple\r\nor the equivalent. On the third day of eating, add small quantities\r\nof vegetable juice and juicy vegetables such as tomatoes and\r\ncucumbers. Control yourself! The second week after eating resumed\r\nadd complex vegetable salads plus more complex fruit salads. Do not\r\nmix fruit and vegetables at meals. The third week add raw nuts and\r\nseeds no more than 1/2 ounce three times daily. Add 1/4 avocado\r\ndaily. Fourth week increase to 3 ounces of raw soaked nuts and seeds\r\ndaily and 1/2 avocado daily. Cooked grains may also be added, along\r\nwith steamed vegetables and vegetable soups.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Rules Of Fasting\r\n\r\nAnother truism of natural hygiene is that we dig our own graves with\r\nour teeth. It is sad but true that almost all eat too much quantity\r\nof too little quality. Dietary excesses are the main cause of death\r\nin North America. Fasting balances these excesses. If people were to\r\neat a perfect diet and not overeat, fasting would rarely be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThere are two essential rules of fasting. If these rules are ignored\r\nor broken, fasting itself can be life threatening. But if the rules\r\nare followed, fasting presents far less risk than any other\r\nimportant medical procedure with a far greater likelihood of a\r\npositive outcome. And let me stress here, there is no medical\r\nprocedure without risk. Life itself is fraught with risk, it is a\r\none-way ticket from birth to death, with no certainty as to when the\r\nend of the line will be reached. But in my opinion, when handling\r\ndegenerative illness and infections, natural hygiene and fasting\r\nusually offer the best hope of healing with the least possible risk.\r\n\r\nThe first vital concern is the duration of the fast. Two eliminatory\r\nprocesses go on simultaneously while fasting. One is the dissolving\r\nand elimination of the excess, toxic or dysfunctional deposits in\r\nthe body, and second process, the gradual exhaustion of the body's\r\nstored nutritional reserves. The fasting body first consumes those\r\nparts of the body that are unhealthy; eventually these are all gone.\r\nSimultaneously the body uses up stored fat and other reserve\r\nnutritional elements. A well-fed reasonably healthy body usually has\r\nenough stored nutrition to fast for quite a bit longer than it takes\r\nto \"clean house.\"\r\n\r\nWhile house cleaning is going on the body uses its reserves to\r\nrebuild organs and rejuvenate itself. Rebuilding starts out very\r\nslowly but the repairs increase at an ever-accelerating rate. The\r\n\"overhaul\" can last only until the body has no more reserves.\r\nBecause several weeks of fasting must pass by before the \"overhaul\"\r\ngets going full speed, it is wise to continue fasting as long as\r\npossible so as to benefit from as much rejuvenation as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is best not to end the fast before all toxic or dysfunctional\r\ndeposits are eliminated, or before the infection is overcome, or\r\nbefore the cause for complaint has been healed. The fast must be\r\nended when most of the body's essential-to-life stored nutritional\r\nreserves are exhausted. If the fast goes beyond this point,\r\nstarvation begins. Then, fasting-induced organic damage can occur,\r\nand death can follow, usually several weeks later. Almost anyone not\r\nimmediately close to death has enough stored nutrition to water fast\r\nfor ten days to two weeks. Most reasonably healthy people have\r\nsufficient reserves to water fast for a month. Later I will explain\r\nhow a faster can somewhat resupply their nutritional reserves while\r\ncontinuing to fast, and thus safely extend the fasting period.\r\n\r\nThe second essential concern has to do with adjusting the intensity\r\nof the fast. Some individuals are so toxic that the waste products\r\nreleased during a fast are too strong, too concentrated or too\r\npoisonous for the organs of elimination to handle safely, or to be\r\nhandled within the willingness of the faster to tolerate the\r\ndiscomforts that toxic releases generate. The highly-toxic faster\r\nmay even experience life-threatening symptoms such as violent asthma\r\nattacks. This kind of faster has almost certainly been dangerously\r\nill before the fast began. Others, though not dangerously sick prior\r\nto fasting, may be nearly as toxic and though not in danger of\r\ndeath, they may not be willing to tolerate the degree of discomfort\r\nfasting can trigger. For this reason I recommend that if at all\r\npossible, before undertaking a fast the person eat mostly raw foods\r\nfor two months and clean up all addictions. This will give the body\r\na chance to detoxify significantly before the water fast is started,\r\nand will make water fasting much more comfortable. Seriously,\r\ndangerously ill people should only fast with experienced guidance,\r\nso the rapidity of their detoxification process may be adjusted to a\r\nlower level if necessary.\r\n\r\nA fast of only one week can accomplish a significant amount of\r\nhealing. Slight healing does occur on shorter fasts, but it is much\r\nmore difficult to see or feel the results. Many people experience\r\nrapid relief from acute headache pain or digestive distress such as\r\ngas attacks, mild gallbladder pain, stomach aches, etc., after only\r\none day's abstention from food. In one week of fasting a person can\r\nrelieve more dangerous conditions such as arthritic pain,\r\nrheumatism, kidney pain, and many symptoms associated with allergic\r\nreactions. But even more fasting time is generally needed for the\r\nbody to completely heal serious diseases. That's because eliminating\r\nlife-threatening problems usually involve rebuilding organs that\r\naren't functioning too well. Major rebuilding begins only after\r\nmajor detoxification has been accomplished, and this takes time.\r\n\r\nYes, even lost organ function can be partially or completely\r\nrestored by fasting. Aging and age-related degeneration is\r\nprogressive, diminishing organ functioning. Organs that make\r\ndigestive enzymes secrete less enzymes. The degenerated immune\r\nsystem loses the ability to mobilize as effectively when the body is\r\nattacked. Liver and kidney efficiency declines. The adrenals tire,\r\nbecoming incapable of dumping massive amounts of stress-handling\r\nhormones or of repeating that effort time after time without\r\nconsiderable rest in between. The consequences of these\r\ninter-dependent deterioration's is a cascade of deterioration that\r\ncontributes to even more rapid deterioration's. The name for this\r\ncascading process is aging. Its inevitable result--death.\r\n\r\nFasting can, to a degree, reverse aging. Because fasting improves\r\norgan functioning, it can slow down aging.\r\n\r\nFasters are often surprised that intensified healing can be\r\nuncomfortable. They have been programmed by our culture and by\r\nallopathic doctors to think that if they are doing the right thing\r\nfor their bodies they should feel better immediately. I wish it\r\nweren't so, but most people have to pay the piper for their dietary\r\nindiscretions and other errors in living. There will be aches and\r\nminor pains and uncomfortable sensations. More about that later. A\r\nrare faster does feel immediately better, and continues to feel ever\r\nbetter by the day, and even has incredible energy while eating\r\nnothing, but the majority of us folks just have to tough it out,\r\nkeeping in mind that the way out is the way through. It is important\r\nto remind yourself at times that even with some discomfort and\r\nconsidering the inconvenience of fasting that you are getting off\r\neasy--one month of self-denial pays for those years of indulgence and\r\nbuys a regenerated body.\r\n\r\nLength Of The Fast\r\n\r\nHow long should a person fast? In cases where there are serious\r\ncomplaints to remedy but where there are no life threatening disease\r\nconditions, a good rule of thumb is to fast on water for one\r\ncomplete day (24 hours) for each year that the person has lived. If\r\nyou are 30 years old, it will take 30 consecutive days of fasting to\r\nrestore complete health. However, thirty fasting days, done a few\r\ndays here and a few there won't equal a month of steady fasting; the\r\nbody accomplishes enormously more in 7 or l4 days of consecutive\r\nfasting, than 7 or 14 days of fasting accumulated sporadically, such\r\nas one day a week. This is not to say that regular short fasts are\r\nnot useful medicine. Periodic day-long fasts have been incorporated\r\ninto many religious traditions, and for good reason; it gives the\r\nbody one day a week to rest, to be free of digestive obligations,\r\nand to catch up on garbage disposal. I heartily recommend it. But it\r\ntakes many years of unfailingly regular brief fasting to equal the\r\nbenefits of one, intensive experience.\r\n\r\nFasting on water much longer than fifteen consecutive days may be\r\ndangerous for the very sick, (unless under experienced supervision)\r\nor too intense for those who are not motivated by severe illness to\r\nwithstand the discomfort and boredom. However, it is possible to\r\nfinish a healing process initiated by one long water fast by\r\nrepeating the fast later. My husband's healing is a good example of\r\nthis. His health began to noticeably decline about age 38 and he\r\nstarted fasting. He fasted on water 14 to 18 days at a time, once a\r\nyear, for five consecutive years before most of his complaints and\r\nproblems entirely vanished.\r\n\r\nThe longest fast I ever supervised was a 90 day water fast on an\r\nextraordinarily obese woman, who at 5' 2\" weighed close to 400\r\npounds. She was a Mormon; generally members of the LDS Church eat a\r\nhealthier diet than most Americans, but her's included far too much\r\nof what I call \"healthfood junkfood,\" in the form of whole grain\r\ncakes and cookies, lots of granola made with lots of honey, oil, and\r\ndried fruit, lots of honey heaped atop heavily buttered whole grain\r\nbread. (I will explain more about the trap of healthfood junkfood\r\nlater on.) A whole foods relatively meatless diet is far superior to\r\nits refined white flour, white sugar and white grease (lard)\r\ncounterpart, but it still produced a serious heath problem in just\r\n30 years of life. Like many women, she expressed love-for-family in\r\nthe kitchen by serving too-much too-tasty food. The Mormons have a\r\nvery strong family orientation and this lady was no exception, but\r\nshe was insecure and unhappy in her marriage and sought consolation\r\nin food, eaten far in excess of what her body needed.\r\n\r\nOn her 90 day water fast she lost about 150 pounds, but was still\r\ngrossly overweight when the fast ended. Toward the end it became\r\nclear that it was unrealistic to try to shrink this woman any closer\r\nto normal body weight because to her, fat represented an invaluable\r\ninsulation or buffer that she was not prepared to give up. As the\r\nweight melted away on the fast and she was able to actually feel the\r\noutline of a hip bone her neurosis became more and more apparent,\r\nand the ability to feel a part of her skeleton was so upsetting to\r\nher that her choice was between life threatening obesity and\r\npervasive anxiety.\r\n\r\nHer weight was still excessive but the solace of eating was even\r\nmore important. This woman needed intensive counseling not more\r\nfasting. Unfortunately, at the end she choose to remain obese. Fat\r\nwas much less frightening to her than confronting her emotions and\r\nfears. The positive side was that after the fast she was able to\r\nmaintain her weight at 225 instead of 375 which was an enormous\r\nrelief to her exhausted heart.\r\n\r\nAnother client I fasted for 90 days was a 6' 1\" tall, chronic\r\nschizophrenic man who weighed in at 400 pounds. He was so big he\r\ncould barely get through my front door, and mine was an\r\nextraordinarily wide door in what had been an upper-class mansion.\r\nThis man, now in his mid twenties, had spent his last seven years in\r\na mental institution before his parents decided to give him one last\r\nchance by sending to Great Oaks School. The state mental hospitals\r\nat that time provided the mentally ill with cigarettes, coffee, and\r\nlots of sugary treats, but none of these substances were part of my\r\ntreatment program so he had a lot of immediate withdrawal to go\r\nthrough. The quickest and easiest way to get him through it was to\r\nput him on a water fast after a few days of preparation on raw food.\r\n\r\nThis was not an easily managed case! He was wildly psychotic, on\r\nheavy doses of chloropromazine, with many bizarre behaviors. Besides\r\ntalking to himself continuously in gibberish, he collected bugs,\r\nmoss, sticks, piles or dirt, and switched to smoking oak leaves\r\ninstead of cigarettes. He was such a fire hazard that I had to move\r\nhim to a downstairs room with concrete floor. Even in the basement\r\nhe was a fire hazard with his smoking and piles of sticks and other\r\ninflammables next to his bed, but all of this debris was his\r\n\"precious.\" I knew that I was in for trouble if I disturbed his\r\nprecious, but the insects and dirt piles seemed to be expanding\r\nexponentially.\r\n\r\nOne day the dirt exceeded my tolerance level. To make a long story\r\nshort he caught me in the act of cleaning up his precious. Was he\r\nfurious! All 350 pounds of him! (By this time he had lost 50\r\npounds.) He barreled into me, fists flying, and knocked me into the\r\npipes next to the furnace and seemed ready to really teach me what\r\nwas what. I prefer to avoid fights, but if they are inevitable, I\r\ncan really get into the spirit of the thing. I'd had lots of\r\nchildhood practice defending myself because I was an incurable\r\ntomboy who loved to wrestle; I could usually pin big boys who\r\nconsidered themselves tough. So I began using my fists and what\r\nlittle martial arts training I had to good use. After I hurt him a\r\nbit he realized that I was not going to be easily intimidated, and\r\nthat in fact he was in danger of getting seriously damaged. So he\r\ncalled a truce before either of us were badly beaten up. He had only\r\na few bruises and welts, nothing serious.\r\n\r\nAfter that he refrained from collecting things inside the building\r\n(he continued to collect outside). This compromise was fine with me,\r\nand the incident allowed me to maintain the authority I needed to\r\nbully him into co-operating with the program: taking his vitamins,\r\nand sticking to his fast until he finally reached 200 pounds. After\r\n90 days on water he actually looked quite handsome, he no longer\r\nsmoked, he was off psychotropic medication, and his behaviors were\r\nwithin an acceptable range as long as your expectations were not too\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nHe was well enough to live outside a hospital and also clear-headed\r\nenough to know that if he let too many people know how well he\r\nreally was, he might have to give up his mental disability pension\r\nand actually become responsible for himself. No way, Jose! This\r\nfellow knew a good thing when he saw it. So he continued to pull\r\nbizarre stunts just often enough in front of the right audience to\r\nkeep his disability checks coming in, while managing to act sane\r\nenough to be allowed to live comfortably at home instead of in the\r\nhospital. By keeping to my program he could stay off mind-numbing\r\npsychotropic medication if he kept up his megavitamins and minerals.\r\nThis compromise was tolerable from his point of view, because there\r\nwere no side effects like he experienced from his tranquilizers.\r\n\r\nIt is very rare for a mentally ill person who has spent more than a\r\nfew months in a mental hospital to ever usefully return to society\r\nbecause they find \"mental illness\" too rewarding.\r\n\r\nMy Own 56 Day Long Fast\r\n\r\nFasters go through a lot of different emotional states, these can\r\nget intense and do change quite rapidly. The physical body, too,\r\nwill manifest transitory conditions. Some can be quite\r\nuncomfortable. But, I don't want to leave the reader with the\r\nimpression that fasting is inevitably painful. So I will now recount\r\nmy own longest fast in detail.\r\n\r\nWhen I did my own 42 day water fast followed by two weeks on carrot\r\njuice diluted 50/50 with water, which really amounted to 56\r\nconsecutive days, my predominant sensation for the first three days\r\nwas a desire to eat that was mostly a mental condition, and a lot of\r\nrumbling and growling from my stomach. This is not real hunger, just\r\nthe sounds the stomach likes to make when it is shrinking. After\r\nall, this organ is accustomed to being filled at regular intervals,\r\nand then, all of a sudden, it gets nothing, so naturally the stomach\r\nwants to know what is going on. Once it realizes it is on temporary\r\nvacation, the stomach wisely decides to reduce itself to a size\r\nsuitable for a retired organ. And it shuts up. This process usually\r\ntakes three to five days and for most people, no further \"hunger\r\npangs\" are felt until the fast is over.\r\n\r\nReal hunger comes only when the body is actually starving. The\r\nintense discomforts many people experience upon missing a meal are\r\nfrequently interpreted as hunger but they aren't. What is actually\r\nhappening is that their highly toxic bodies are taking the\r\nopportunity presented by having missed a meal or two to begin to\r\ncleanse. The toxins being released and processed make assorted\r\nunpleasant symptoms such as headaches and inability to think\r\nclearly. These symptoms can be instantly eliminated by the intake of\r\na bit of food, bringing the detox to a screeching halt.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks into the fast I experienced sharp abdominal pains that\r\nfelt like I imagine appendicitis feels, which compelled me toward\r\nthe nearest toilet in a state of great urgency where I productively\r\nbusied myself for about half an hour. As I mentioned earlier, I was\r\nexperimentally adhering to a rigid type of fast of the sort\r\nrecommended by Dr. Herbert Shelton, a famous advocate of the Natural\r\nHygiene school. Shelton was such a powerful writer and personality\r\nthat there still exists a Natural Hygiene Society that keeps his\r\nbooks in print and maintains his library. The words \"Natural\r\nHygiene\" are almost owned by the society like a trademark and they\r\nobject when anyone describes themselves as a hygienist and then\r\nadvocates any practice that Dr. Shelton did not approve of.\r\n\r\nPer Dr. Shelton, I was going to fast from the time hunger left until\r\nthe time it returned and I was not going to use any form of colon\r\ncleansing. Shelton strongly opposed bowel cleansing so I did no\r\nenemas nor colonics, nor herbs, nor clays, nor psyllium seed\r\ndesigned to clean the bowel, etc. Obviously at day 14 the bowel\r\nsaid, enough is enough of this crap, and initiated a goods house\r\ncleaning session. When I saw what was eliminated I was horrified to\r\nthink that I had left that stuff in there for two weeks. I then\r\nstarted to wonder if the Sheltonites were mistaken about this aspect\r\nof fasting. Nonetheless, I persevered on the same regimen because my\r\nhunger had not returned, my tongue was still thickly coated with\r\nfoul-smelling, foul-tasting mucus and I still had some fat on my\r\nfeet that had not been metabolized.\r\n\r\nShelton said that cleansing is not complete until a skeletal\r\ncondition is reached--that is, absolutely no fat reserves are left.\r\nUp until that time I did not even know that I had fat on my feet,\r\nbut much to my surprise, as the weeks went on, not only did my\r\nbreasts disappear except for a couple of land marks well-known to my\r\nbabies, but my ribs and hip bones became positively dangerous to\r\npassersby, and my shoes would not stay on my feet. This was not all\r\nthat surprising because I went from 135 pounds down to 85 on a 5' 7\"\r\nframe with substantial bone structure.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the fast my eyes became brighter and clearer blue,\r\nmy skin took on a good texture, my breath finally became sweet, my\r\ntongue cleared up and became pink, my mind was clear, and my\r\nspiritual awareness and sensitivity was heightened. In other words,\r\nI was no longer a walking hulk of stored-up toxemia. I also felt\r\nquite weak and had to rest for ten minutes out every hour in\r\nhorizontal position. (I should have rested much more.) I also\r\nrequired very little sleep, although it felt good to just lie\r\nquietly and rest, being aware of what was going on in various parts\r\nof my body.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few weeks on water I became very attentive to my\r\nright shoulder. Two separate times in the past, while flying head\r\nfirst over the handlebars of my bicycle I had broken my shoulder\r\nwith considerable tearing of ligaments and tendons. At night when I\r\nwas totally still I felt a whole crew of pixies and brownies with\r\npicks and shovels at work in the joint doing major repair work. This\r\nactivity was not entirely comfortable, but I knew it was\r\nconstructive work, not destructive, so I joined the work crew with\r\nmy mind's eye and helped the work along.\r\n\r\nIt seemed my visualizations actually did help. Ever since, I've had\r\nthe fasters I supervised use creative imagery or write affirmations\r\nto help their bodies heal. There are lots of books on this subject.\r\nI've found that the techniques work far better on a faster than when\r\na person is eating normally.\r\n\r\nAfter breaking the fast it took me six weeks to regain enough\r\nstrength that I could run my usual distance in my regular time; it\r\ntook me six months to regain my full 135 pound weight because I was\r\nvery careful to break the fast slowly and correctly. Coming off\r\nwater with two weeks on dilute carrot juice I then added small\r\nportions of raw food such as apples, raw vegetables, sprouts,\r\nvegetable juices, and finally in the fourth week after I began\r\ndrinking dilute carrot juice, I added seven daily well-chewed\r\nalmonds to my rebuilding diet. Much later I increased to 14 almonds,\r\nbut that was the maximum amount of such highly concentrated fare my\r\nbody wanted digest at one time for over one year. I found I got a\r\nlot more miles to the gallon out of the food that I did eat, and did\r\nnot crave recreational foods. Overall I was very pleased with my\r\neducational fast, it had taught me a great deal.\r\n\r\nIf I had undertaken such a lengthy fast at a time when I was\r\nactually ill, and therefore had felt forced into it, my experience\r\ncould have been different. A positive mental attitude is an\r\nessential part of the healing process so fasting should not be\r\nundertaken in a negative, protesting mental state. The mind is so\r\npowerful that fear or the resistance fear generates can override the\r\nhealing capacity of the body. For that reason I always recommend\r\nthat people who consider themselves to be healthy, who have no\r\nserious complaints, but who are interested in water fasting, should\r\nlimit themselves to ten consecutive days or so, certainly never more\r\nthan 14. Few healthy people, even those with a deep interest in the\r\nprocess, can find enough personal motivation to overcome the extreme\r\nboredom of water fasting for longer than that. Healthy people\r\nusually begin protesting severely after about two weeks. If there is\r\nany one vital rule of fasting, one never should fast over strong,\r\npersonal protest. Anytime you're fasting and you really desire to\r\nquit, you probably should. Unless, of course, you are critically\r\nill. Then you may have no choice--its fast or die.\r\n\r\nCommon Fasting Complaints And Discomforts\r\n\r\nThe most frequently heard complaints of fasters are headaches, dry,\r\ncracked lips, dizziness, blurred vision with black spots that float,\r\nskin rashes, and weakness in the first few days plus what they think\r\nis intense hunger. The dizziness and weakness are really real, and\r\nare due to increased levels of toxins circulating in the blood and\r\nfrom unavoidably low blood sugar which is a natural consequence of\r\nthe cessation of eating. The blood sugar does reestablish a new\r\nequilibrium in the second and third week of the fast and then, the\r\ndizziness may cease, but still, it is important to expect dizziness\r\nat the beginning.\r\n\r\nIt always takes more time for the blood to reach the head on a fast\r\nbecause everything has slowed down, including the rate of the heart\r\nbeat, so blood pressure probably has dropped as well. If you stand\r\nup very quickly you may faint. I repetitively instruct all of my\r\nclients to stand up very slowly, moving from a lying to a sitting\r\nposition, pausing there for ten or twenty seconds, and then rising\r\nslowly from a sitting to a standing position. They are told that at\r\nthe first sign of dizziness they must immediately put their head\r\nbetween their knees so that the head is lower than the heart, or\r\nsquat/sit down on the floor, I once had a faster who forgot to obey\r\nmy frequent warnings. About two weeks into a long fast, she got up\r\nrapidly from the toilet and felt dizzy. The obvious thing to do was\r\nto sit back down on the toilet or lie down on the bath rug on the\r\nfloor, but no, she decided that because she was dizzy she should\r\nrush back to her bed in the adjoining room. She made it as far as\r\nthe bathroom door and fainted, out cold, putting a deep grove into\r\nthe drywall with her pretty nose on the way down. We then had to\r\nmake an unscheduled visit to a nose specialist, who calmly put a\r\ntape-wrapped spoon inside her bent-over nose and pried it back to\r\ndead center. This was not much fun for either of us; it is well\r\nworthwhile preventing such complications.\r\n\r\nOther common complaints during the fast include coldness, due to low\r\nblood sugar as well as a consequence of weight loss and slowed\r\ncirculation due to lessened physical activity. People also dislike\r\ninactivity which seems excruciatingly boring, and some are upset by\r\nweight loss itself. Coldness is best handled with lots of clothes,\r\nbedding, hot water bottles or hot pads, and warm baths. Great Oaks\r\nSchool of Health was in Oregon, where the endlessly rainy winters\r\nare chilly and the concrete building never seemed to get really\r\nwarm. I used to dream of moving my fasters to a tropical climate\r\nwhere I could also get the best, ripest fruits to wean them back on\r\nto food.\r\n\r\nIf the fast goes on for more than a week or ten days, many people\r\ncomplain of back discomfort, usually caused by over-worked kidneys.\r\nThis passes. Hot baths or hot water bottles provide some relief.\r\nDrinking more fluids may also help a bit. Nausea is fairly common\r\ntoo, due to toxic discharges from the gall bladder. Drinking lots of\r\nwater or herbal tea dilutes toxic bile in the stomach and makes it\r\nmore tolerable.\r\n\r\nVery few fasters sleep well and for some reason they expect to,\r\ncertainly fasters hope to, because they think that if they sleep all\r\nnight they will better survive one more deadly dull day in a state\r\nof relative unconsciousness. They find out much to their displeasure\r\nthat very little sleep is required on a fast because the body is at\r\nrest already. Many fasters sleep only two to four hours but doze\r\nfrequently and require a great deal of rest. Being mentally prepared\r\nfor this change of habit is the best handling. Generalized low-grade\r\naches and pains in the area of the diseased organs or body parts are\r\ncommon and can often be alleviated with hot water bottles, warm but\r\nnot hot bath water and massage. If this type of discomfort exists,\r\nit usually lessens with each passing day until it disappears\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nMany fasters complain that their vision is blurred, and that they\r\nare unable to concentrate. These are really major inconveniences\r\nbecause then fasters can't read or even pay close attention to\r\nvideo-taped movies, and if they can't divert themselves some fasters\r\nthink they will go stir crazy. They are so addicted to a hectic\r\nschedule of doingness, and/or being entertained that they just can't\r\nstand just being with themselves, forced to confront and deal with\r\nthe sensations of their own body, forced to face their own thoughts,\r\nto confront their own emotions, many of which are negative. People\r\nwho are fasting release a lot of mental/emotional garbage at the\r\nsame time as they let go of old physical garbage. Usually the\r\npsychological stuff contributed greatly to their illness and just\r\nlike the physical garbage and degenerated organs, it all needs to be\r\nprocessed.\r\n\r\nOne of the most distressing experiences that happen occasionally is\r\nhair loss. Deprived of adequate nutrition, the follicles can not\r\nkeep growing hair, and the existing hair dies. However, the\r\nfollicles themselves do not die and once the fast has ended and\r\nsufficient nutrition is forthcoming, hair will regrow as well or\r\nbetter than before.\r\n\r\nThere are also complaints that occur after the fast has been broken.\r\nPost-fast cravings, even after only two weeks of deprivation, are to\r\nbe expected. These may take the form of desires for sweet, sour,\r\nsalt, or a specific food dreamed of while fasting, like chocolate\r\nfudge sundays or just plain toast. Food cravings must be controlled\r\nat all costs because if acted upon, each indulgence chips away the\r\nhealth gains of the previous weeks. A single indulgence can be\r\nremedied by a day of restricting the diet to juice or raw food.\r\nAfter the repair, the person feels as good as they did when the fast\r\nended. Repeated indulgences will require another extended bout of\r\nfasting to repair. It is far better to learn self-control.\r\n\r\nThe Healing Crisis And Retracing\r\n\r\nCertain unpleasant somatics that occur while fasting (or while on a\r\nhealing diet) may not be dangerous or \"bad.\" Two types, the healing\r\ncrisis, and retracing, are almost inevitable. A well-educated faster\r\nshould welcome these discomforts when they happen. The healing\r\ncrisis (but not retracing) also occurs on a healing diet.\r\n\r\nThe healing crisis can seem a big surprise to a faster who has been\r\nprogressing wonderfully. Suddenly, usually after a few days of\r\nnoticeably increased well-being, they suddenly experience a set of\r\nsevere symptoms and feel just awful. This is not a setback, not\r\nsomething to be upset or disappointed about, but a healing crisis,\r\nactually a positive sign\r\n\r\nHealing crises always occur after a period of marked improvement. As\r\nthe vital force builds up during the healing process, the body\r\ndecides it now has obtained enough energy to throw off some\r\naccumulated toxins, and forcefully pushes them out through a typical\r\nand usually previously used route of secondary elimination, such as\r\nthe nose, lungs, stomach, intestines, skin, or perhaps produces a\r\nflu-like experience with fever chills, sweat, aches and pains, etc.\r\nThough unpleasant, this experience is to be encouraged; the body has\r\nmerely accelerated its elimination process. Do not attempt to\r\nsuppress any of these symptoms, don't even try to moderate fever,\r\nwhich is the body's effective way to burn out a virus or bacteria\r\ninfection, unless it is a dangerously high fever (over 102 degree\r\nFahrenheit). Fever can be lowered without drugs by putting the\r\nperson into a cool/cold bath, or using cold towel wraps and cold\r\nwater sponge baths. The good news is that healing crises usually do\r\nnot last long, and when they are past you feel better than you did\r\nbefore the crisis.\r\n\r\nAsthmatics seem to have the worst crises. I have had asthmatics\r\nbring up a quart of obnoxious mucous from their lungs every night\r\nfor weeks. They have stayed awake all night for three nights\r\ncontinuously coughing and choking on the material that was being\r\neliminated. After that clearing-out process they were able to breath\r\nmuch more freely. Likewise I have had people who have had sinusitis\r\nhave nothing but non-stop pussy discharge from their sinuses for\r\nthree weeks. Some of this would run down the throat and cause\r\nnausea. All I could say to encourage the sufferer was that it needed\r\nto come out and to please stand aside and let the body work its\r\nmagic. These fasters were not grateful until the sinus problem that\r\nhad plagued them since childhood disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe interesting thing about healing crises are that the symptoms\r\nproduced retrace earlier complaints; they are almost never something\r\nentirely unknown to the patient. Usually they are old, familiar\r\nsomatics, often complaints that haven't bothered the faster for many\r\nyears. The reason the symptom is familiar but is not currently a\r\nproblem is because as the body degenerates it loses vital force;\r\nwith less vital force it loses the ability to create such acute\r\ndetoxification episodes in non-life-threatening secondary\r\nelimination routes. The degenerated body makes less violent efforts\r\nto cleanse, efforts that aren't as uncomfortable. The negative side\r\nof this is that instead of creating acute discomfort in peripheral\r\nsystems, the toxemia goes to more vital organs where it hastens the\r\nformation of life-threatening conditions.\r\n\r\nThere is a very normal and typical progress for each person's fatal\r\nillness. Their ultimate disease starts out in childhood or\r\nadolescence as acute inflammations of skin-like organs, viral or\r\nbacterial infections of the same. Then, as vital force weakens,\r\nsecondary eliminations are shifted to more vital organs. Allergies\r\nor colds stop happening so frequently; the person becomes rheumatic,\r\narthritic or experience weakness in joints, tendons, ligaments, or\r\nto have back pains, or to have digestive upsets. These new symptoms\r\nare more constant but usually less acute. Ultimately, vital organs\r\nbegin to malfunction, and serious disease develop. But a hygienist\r\nsees the beginning of fatal diseases such as cancer in adolescent\r\ninfections and allergies.\r\n\r\nRetracing is generally seen only on water fasts, not on extended\r\ncleansing diets. The body begins to repair itself by healing\r\nconditions in the reverse order to that which they occurred\r\noriginally. This means that the body would first direct healing\r\ntoward the lungs if the most recently serious illness was an attack\r\nof pneumonia six months previously. In this case you would expect to\r\nquickly and intensely experience a mini-case of pneumonia while the\r\nbody eliminates residues in the lungs that were not completely\r\ndischarged at the time. Next the body might take you through a\r\nperiod of depression that you had experienced five years in the\r\npast. The faster may be profoundly depressed for a few days and come\r\nout of it feeling much better. You could then reexperience\r\nsensation-states like those caused by recreational drugs you had\r\nplayfully experimented with ten years previously along with the\r\n\"trippiness\" if it were a hallucinogen, speediness if it was \"speed\"\r\nor the dopiness if it was heroin. Retracing further, the faster\r\nmight then experience something similar to a raging attack of\r\ntonsillitis which you vaguely remember having when you were five\r\nyears old, but fortunately this time it passes in three days (or\r\nmaybe six hours), instead of three weeks. This is retracing.\r\n\r\nPlease do not be surprised or alarmed if it happens to you on a\r\nfast, and immediately throw out the baby with the bath water\r\nthinking that you are doing the wrong thing because all those old\r\nillnesses are coming back to haunt you. It is the body's magnificent\r\nhealing effort working on your behalf, and for doing it your body\r\ndeserves lots of \"well done\", \"good body\" thoughts rather than\r\ngnashing of teeth and thinking what did I do to deserve this. The\r\nbody won't tell you what you did to deserve this, but it knows and\r\nis trying its darndest to undo it.\r\n\r\nThe Unrelenting Boredom Of Fasting\r\n\r\nThen there's the unrelenting boredom of fasting. Most people have\r\nbeen media junkies since they were kids; the only way they believe\r\nthey can survive another day of fasting is by diverting their minds\r\nwith TV. This is far from ideal because often the emotions of a\r\nfaster are like an open wound and when they resonate with the\r\nemotions portrayed on most TV shows, the faster gets into some very\r\nunpleasant states that interfere with healing. And the emotions many\r\nmovies prompt people to sympathetically generate are powerful ones,\r\noften highly negative, and contrary to healing. Especially unhelpful\r\nare the adrenaline rushes in action movies. But if TV is the best a\r\nfaster can do, it is far better that someone fast with television\r\nprogramming filling their minds than to not fast at all. I keep a\r\nlibrary of positive VHS tapes for these addicts--comedies, stories of\r\nheroic over-comings, depiction's of humans at their best.\r\n\r\nBoredom is probably the most limiting factor to fasting a long time.\r\nThat is because boredom is progressive, it gets worse with each\r\nslowly-passing day. But concurrently, the rate of healing is\r\naccelerating with each slowly-passing day. Every day the faster gets\r\nthrough does them considerably more good than the previous day.\r\nHowever, fasters rarely are motivated enough to overcome boredom for\r\nmore than two weeks or so, unless they started the fast to solve a\r\nvery serious or life-threatening condition. For this reason,\r\nbasically well people should not expect to be able to fast for more\r\nthan a couple of weeks every six months or year, no matter how much\r\ngood a longer fast might do.\r\n\r\nExercise While Fasting\r\n\r\nThe issue of how much activity is called for on a fast is\r\ncontroversial. Natural Hygienists in the Herbert Shelton tradition\r\ninsist that all fasters absolutely must have complete bed rest, with\r\nno books, no TV, no visitors, no enemas, no exercise, no music, and\r\nof course no food, not even a cup of herb tea. In my many years of\r\nconducting people through fasts, I have yet to meet an individual\r\nthat could mentally tolerate this degree of nothingness. It is too\r\ndrastic a withdrawal from all the stimulation people are used to in\r\nthe twentieth century. I still don't know how Shelton managed to\r\nmake his patients do it, but my guess is that he must have been a\r\nvery intimidating guy. Shelton was a body builder of some renown in\r\nhis day. I bet Shelton's patients kept a few books and magazines\r\nunder their mattress and only took them out when he wasn't looking.\r\nIf I had tried to enforced this type of sensory deprivation, I know\r\nmy patients would have grabbed their clothes and run, vowing never\r\nto fast again. I think it is most important that people fast, and\r\nthat they feel so good about the experience that they want to do it\r\nagain, and talk all their sick friends into doing the same thing.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to enforced inactivity, Russian researchers who\r\nsupervised schizophrenics on 30 day water fasts insisted that they\r\nwalk for three hours every day, without stopping. I would like to\r\nhave been there to see how they managed to enforce that. I suspect\r\nsome patients cheated. I lived with schizophrenics enough years to\r\nknow that it is very difficult to get them to do anything that they\r\ndon't want to do, and very few of them are into exercise, especially\r\nwhen fasting.\r\n\r\nIn my experience both of these approaches to activity during the\r\nfast are extremes. The correct activity level should be arrived at\r\non an individual basis. I have had clients who walked six miles a\r\nday during an extended water fast, but they were not feeling very\r\nsick when they started the fast, and they were also physically fit.\r\nIn contrast I have had people on extended fasts who were unable to\r\nwalk for exercise, or so weak they were unable to even walk to the\r\nbathroom, but these people were critically ill when they started\r\nfasting, and desperately needed to conserve what little vital force\r\nthey had for healing.\r\n\r\nMost people who are not critically ill need to walk at least 200\r\nyards twice a day, with assistance if necessary, if only to move the\r\nlymph through the system. The lymphatic system is a network of ducts\r\nand nodes which are distributed throughout the body, with high\r\nconcentrations of nodes in the neck, chest, arm pits, and groin. Its\r\njob is to carry waste products from the extremities to the center of\r\nthe body where they can be eliminated. The blood is circulated\r\nthrough the arteries and veins in the body by the contractions of\r\nthe heart, but the lymphatic system does not have a pump. Lymphatic\r\nfluid is moved by the contractions of the muscles, primarily those\r\nof the arms and legs. If the faster is too weak to move, massage and\r\nassisted movements are essential.\r\n\r\nLymph nodes are also a part of our immune system and produce white\r\nblood cells to help control invading organisms. When the lymph is\r\noverloaded with waste products the ducts and nodes swell, and until\r\nthe source of the local irritation is removed, are incapable of\r\nhandling further debris. If left in this condition for years they\r\nbecome so hard they feel like rocks under the skin. Lumps in the\r\narmpits or the groin are prime sites for the future development of a\r\ncancer. Fasting, massage, and poultices will often soften overloaded\r\nlymph nodes and coax them back into operation.\r\n\r\nThe Stages Of Fasting\r\n\r\nThe best way to understand what happens when we fast is to break up\r\nthe process into six stages: preparation for the fast, loss of\r\nhunger, acidosis, normalization, healing, and breaking the fast.\r\n\r\nA person that has consumed the typical American diet most of their\r\nlife and whose life is not in immediate danger would be very wise to\r\ngently prepare their body for the fast. Two weeks would be a minimum\r\namount of time, and if the prospective faster wants an easier time\r\nof it, they should allow a month or even two for preliminary\r\nhousecleaning. During this time, eliminate all meat, fish, dairy\r\nproducts, eggs, coffee, black tea, salt, sugar, alcohol, drugs,\r\ncigarettes, and greasy foods. This de-addiction will make the\r\nprocess of fasting much more pleasant, and is strongly recommended.\r\nHowever, eliminating all these harmful substances is withdrawal from\r\naddictive substances and will not be easy for most. I have more to\r\nsay about this later when I talk about allergies and addictions.\r\n\r\nThe second stage, psychological hunger, usually is felt as an\r\nintense desire for food. This passes within three or four days of\r\nnot eating anything. Psychological hunger usually begins with the\r\nfirst missed meal. If the faster seems to be losing their resolve, I\r\nhave them drink unlimited quantities of good-tasting herb teas,\r\n(sweetened--only if absolutely necessary--with nutrisweet). Salt-free\r\nbroths made from meatless instant powder (obtainable at the health\r\nfood store) can also fend off the desire to eat until the stage of\r\nhunger has passed.\r\n\r\nAcidosis, the third stage, usually begins a couple of days after the\r\nlast meal and lasts about one week. During acidosis the body\r\nvigorously throws off acid waste products. Most people starting a\r\nfast begin with an overly acid blood pH from the typical American\r\ndiet that contains a predominance of acid-forming foods. Switching\r\nover to burning fat for fuel triggers the release of even more\r\nacidic substances. Acidosis is usually accompanied by fatigue,\r\nblurred vision, and possibly dizziness. The breath smells very bad,\r\nthe tongue is coated with bad-tasting dryish mucus, and the urine\r\nmay be concentrated and foul unless a good deal of water is taken\r\ndaily. Two to three quarts a day is a reasonable amount.\r\n\r\nMild states of acidosis are a common occurrence. While sleeping\r\nafter the last meal of the day is digested bodies normally work very\r\nhard trying to detoxify from yesterday's abuses. So people routinely\r\nawaken in a state of acidosis. Their tongue is coated, their breath\r\nfoul and they feel poorly. They end their brief overnight fast with\r\nbreakfast, bringing the detoxification process to a screeching halt\r\nand feel much better. Many people think they awaken hungry and don't\r\nfeel well until they eat. They confuse acidosis with hunger when\r\nmost have never experienced real hunger in their entire lives. If\r\nyou typically awaken in acidosis, you are being given a strong sign\r\nby your body that it would like to continue fasting far beyond\r\nbreakfast. In fact, it probably would enjoy fasting long beyond the\r\nend of acidosis.\r\n\r\nMost fasters feel much more comfortable by the end of the first\r\nseven to ten days, when they enter the normalization phase; here the\r\nacidic blood chemistry is gradually corrected. This sets the stage\r\nfor serious healing of body tissues and organs. Normalization may\r\ntake one or two more weeks depending on how badly the body was out\r\nof balance. As the blood chemistry steadily approaches perfection,\r\nthe faster usually feels an increasing sense of well-being, broken\r\nby short spells of discomfort that are usually healing crises or\r\nretracings.\r\n\r\nThe next stage, accelerated healing, can take one or many weeks\r\nmore, again depending on how badly the body has been damaged.\r\nHealing proceeds rapidly after the blood chemistry has been\r\nstabilized, the person is usually in a state of profound rest and\r\nthe maximum amount of vital force can be directed toward repair and\r\nregeneration of tissues. This is a miraculous time when tumors are\r\nmetabolized as food for the body, when arthritic deposits dissolve,\r\nwhen scar tissues tend to disappear, when damaged organs regain lost\r\nfunction (if they can). Seriously ill people who never fast long\r\nenough to get into this stage (usually it takes about ten days to\r\ntwo weeks of water fasting to seriously begin healing) never find\r\nout what fasting can really do for them.\r\n\r\nBreaking the fast is equally or more important a stage than the fast\r\nitself. It is the most dangerous time in the entire fast. If you\r\nstop fasting prematurely, that is, before the body has completed\r\ndetoxification and healing, expect the body to reject food when you\r\ntry to make it eat, even if you introduce foods very gradually. The\r\nfaster, the spiritual being running the body, may have become bored\r\nand want some action, but the faster's body hasn't finished. The\r\nbody wants to continue healing.\r\n\r\nBy rejection, I mean that food may not digest, may feel like a stone\r\nin your stomach, make you feel terrible. If that happens and if,\r\ndespite that clear signal you refuse to return to fasting, you\r\nshould go on a juice diet, take as little as possible, sip it slowly\r\n(almost chew it) and stay on juice until you find yourself digesting\r\nit easily. Then and only then, reintroduce a little solid raw food\r\nlike a green salad.\r\n\r\nWeaning yourself back on to food should last just as long as the\r\nfast. Your first tentative meals should be dilute, raw juices. After\r\nseveral days of slowly building up to solid raw fruit, small amounts\r\nof raw vegetable foods should be added. If it has been a long fast,\r\nsay over three weeks, this reintroduction should be done gingerly\r\nover a few weeks. If this stage is poorly managed or ignored you may\r\nbecome acutely ill, and for someone who started fasting while\r\ndangerously ill, loss of self control and impulsive eating could\r\nprove fatal. Even for those fasting to cure non-life-threatening\r\nillnesses it is pointless to go through the effort and discipline of\r\na long fast without carefully establishing a correct diet after the\r\nfast ends, or the effort will have largely been wasted.\r\n\r\nFoods For Monodiet, Juice or Broth Fasting\r\n\r\nzucchini, garlic, onion, green beans, kale, celery, beet greens and\r\nroot, cabbage, carrot, wheat grass juice, alfalfa juice, barley\r\ngreen juice, parsley juice, lemon/lime juice, grapefruit juice,\r\napples (not juice, too sweet), diluted orange juice, diluted grape\r\njuice\r\n\r\nLess-Rigorous-Than-Water Fasts\r\n\r\nThere are gradations of fasting measures ranging from rigorous to\r\nrelatively casual. Water fasting is the most rapid and effective\r\none. Other methods have been created by grasping the underlying\r\ntruth of fasting, namely whenever the digestive effort can be\r\nreduced, by whatever degree, whenever the formation of the toxins of\r\nmisdigestion can be reduced or prevented, to that extent the body\r\ncan divert energy to the healing process. Thus comes about assorted\r\nfamous and sometimes notorious monodiet semi-fasts like the grape\r\ncure where the faster eats only grapes for a month or so, or the\r\nlemon cure, where the juice of one or more lemons is added to water\r\nand nothing else is consumed for weeks on end. Here I should also\r\nmention the \"lemon juice/cayenne pepper/maple syrup cure,\" the\r\nvarious green drink cures using spirulina, chlorella, barley green\r\nor wheat grass, and the famous Bieler broths--vegetable soups made of\r\novercooked green beans or zucchini.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that monodiets work because of some magical\r\nproperty of a particular food used. They work because they are\r\nsemi-fasts and may be extremely useful, especially for those\r\nindividuals who can not or will not tolerate a water fast.\r\n\r\nThe best foods for monodiet fasting are the easiest ones digest:\r\njuices of raw fruits and nonstarchy vegetables with all solids\r\nstrained out. Strained mineral broths made of long-simmered\r\nnon-starchy vegetables (the best of them made of leafy green\r\nvegetables) fall in the same category. So if you are highly partial\r\nto the flavor of grapes or lemons or cayenne and (highly diluted)\r\nmaple syrup, a long fast on one of these would do you a world of\r\ngood, just not quite as much good as the same amount of time spent\r\non water alone. If you select something more \"solid\" for a long\r\nmonodiet fast, like pureed zucchini, it is essential that you not\r\novereat. Dr. Bieler gave his fasting patients only one pint of\r\nzucchini soup three or four times a day. The way to evaluate how\r\nmuch to eat is by how much weight you are losing. When fasting, you\r\nmust lose weight! And the faster the better.\r\n\r\nPure absolute water fasting while not taking any vitamins or other\r\nnutritional supplementation has a very limited maximum duration,\r\nperhaps 45 days. The key concept here is nutritional reserves. Body\r\nfat is stored, surplus energy fuel. But energy alone cannot keep a\r\nbody going. It needs much more than fuel to rebuild and repair and\r\nmaintain its systems. So the body in its wisdom also stores up\r\nvitamins and minerals and other essential substances in and\r\nin-between all its cells. Bodies that have been very well nourished\r\nfor a long time have very large reserves; poorly nourished ones may\r\nhave very little set aside for a rainy day. And it is almost a\r\ntruism that a sick person has, for quite some time, been a poorly\r\nnourished one. With low nutritional reserves. This fact alone can\r\nmake it difficult for a sick person to water fast for enough time to\r\ncompletely heal their damaged organs and other systems.\r\n\r\nObese people have fat reserves sufficient to provide energy for long\r\nperiods, but rarely can any body, no matter how complete its\r\nnutrition was for years previously, contain sufficient nutritional\r\nreserves to support a water fast of over six weeks. To water fast\r\nthe very obese down to normal weight can take months but to make\r\nthis possible, rather diverse and concentrated nutrition containing\r\nfew calories must be given. It is possible to fast even a very slim\r\na person for quite a bit longer than a month when their body is\r\nreceiving easily assimilable vitamins and minerals and small amounts\r\nof sugars or other simple carbohydrates.\r\n\r\nI estimate that fasting on raw juices and mineral broths will result\r\nin healing at 25 to 75 percent of the efficiency of water fasting,\r\ndepending on the amount of nutrition taken and the amount the juices\r\nor broths are diluted. But juice fasting can permit healing to go on\r\nseveral times longer than water might.\r\n\r\nFasting on dilute juice and broth can also save the life of someone\r\nwhose organs of elimination are insufficiently strong to withstand\r\nthe work load created by water fasting. In this sense, juices can be\r\nregarded as similar to the moderators in a nuclear reactor, slowing\r\nthe process down so it won't destroy the container. On a fast of\r\nundiluted juice, the healing power drops considerably, but a person\r\non this regimen, if not sick, is usually capable of working.\r\n\r\nDuration of juice fasts can vary greatly. Most of the time there is\r\nno need to continue fasting after the symptoms causing concern have\r\nbeen eliminated, and this could happen as quickly as one week or\r\ntake as long as 60 days if the person is very obese. Fasters also\r\nlose their motivation once the complaint has vanished. But feeling\r\nbetter is no certain indication that the need to fast has ended.\r\nThis points up one of the liabilities of juice fasting; the person\r\nis already eating, their digestive system never shut down and\r\nconsequently, it is much easier for them to resume eating. The thing\r\nto keep in mind is that if the symptoms return, the fast was not\r\nlong enough or the diet was not properly reformed after the fast.\r\n\r\nDuring a long fast on water or dilute juice, if the body has used up\r\nall of it's reserves and/or the body has reached skeletal condition,\r\nand the condition or symptoms being addressed persists the fast\r\nshould be ended, the person should go on a raw food healing diet. If\r\nthree to six months on raw food don't solve the complaint then\r\nanother spell of water or dilute juice fasting should be attempted.\r\nMost fasters are incapable of persisting until the body reserves\r\nhave been used up because social conditioning is telling them their\r\nemaciated-looking body must be dying when it is actually far from\r\ndeath, but return of true hunger is the critical indicator that must\r\nnot be ignored. True hunger is not what most people think of when\r\nthey think they are hungry. Few Americans have ever experienced true\r\nhunger. It is not a rumbling in the stomach or a set of\r\nuncomfortable sensations (caused by the beginning of detoxification)\r\nyou know will go away after eating. True hunger is an animal,\r\ninstinctual feeling in the back of one's throat (not in the stomach)\r\nthat demands you eat something, anything, even grass or shoe\r\nleather.\r\n\r\nSeriously ill people inevitably start the cleansing process with a\r\npre-existing and serious mineral deficiencies. I say inevitably\r\nbecause they likely would not have become ill had they been properly\r\nnourished. Sick fasters may be wise to take in minerals from thin\r\nvegetable broths or vitamin-like supplements in order to prevent\r\nuncomfortable deficiency states. For example calcium or magnesium\r\ndeficiencies can make water fasters experience unpleasant symptoms\r\nsuch as hand tremors, stiff muscles, cramps in the hands, feet, and\r\nlegs, and difficulty relaxing. I want to stress here that fasting\r\nitself does not create deficiencies. But a person already deficient\r\nin minerals should watch for these symptoms and take steps to remedy\r\nthe deficiencies if necessary.\r\n\r\nRaw Food Healing Diets\r\n\r\nNext in declining order of healing effectiveness is what I call a\r\nraw food healing diet or cleansing diet. It consists of those very\r\nsame watery fruits and nonstarchy vegetables one juices or makes\r\ninto vegetable broths, but eaten whole and raw. Heating food does\r\ntwo harmful things: it destroys many vitamins, enzymes and other\r\nnutritional elements and it makes many foods much harder to digest.\r\nSo no cooked vegetables or fruits are allowed because to maintain\r\nhealth on this limited regimen it is essential that every possible\r\nvitamin and enzyme present in the food be available for digestion.\r\nEven though still raw, no starchy or fatty vegetables or fruits are\r\nallowed that contain concentrated calories like potatoes, winter\r\nsquash, avocados, sweet potatoes, fresh raw corn, dates, figs,\r\nraisins, or bananas. And naturally, no salad dressings containing\r\nvegetable oils or (raw) ground seeds are allowed. Nor are raw grains\r\nor other raw concentrated energy sources.\r\n\r\nWhen a person starts this diet they will at first experience\r\nconsiderable weight loss because it is difficult to extract a large\r\nnumber of calories from these foods (though I have seen people\r\nactually gain weight on a pure melon diet, so much sugar do these\r\nfruits have, and well-chewed watermelon seeds are very nourishing).\r\nEating even large quantities of only raw fruit and raw non-starchy\r\nvegetables results in a slow but steady healing process about 10 to\r\n20 percent as rapid as water fasting.\r\n\r\nA raw food cleansing diet has several huge advantages. It is\r\npossible to maintain this regimen and regularly do non-strenuous\r\nwork for many months, even a year or more without experiencing\r\nmassive weight loss and, more important to some people, without\r\nsuffering the extremes of low blood sugar, weakness and loss of\r\nability to concentrate that happen when water fasting. Someone on a\r\nraw food cleanse will have periods of lowered energy and strong\r\ncravings for more concentrated foods, but if they have the\r\nself-discipline to not break their cleansing process they can\r\naccomplish a great deal of healing while still maintaining more or\r\nless normal (though slower paced) life activities. However, almost\r\nno one on this diet is able to sustain an extremely active\r\nlife-style involving hard physical labor or competitive sports. And\r\nfrom the very beginning someone on a raw food cleanse must be\r\nwilling and able to lie down and rest any time they feel tired or\r\nunable to face their responsibilities. Otherwise they will\r\ninevitably succumb to the mental certainty that their feelings of\r\nexhaustion or overwhelm can be immediately solved by eating some\r\nconcentrated food to \"give them energy.\" Such low-energy states\r\nwill, however, pass quickly after a brief nap or rest.\r\n\r\nSomething else gradually happens to a body when on such a diet. Do\r\nyou recall that I mentioned that after my own long fast I began to\r\nget more \"mileage\" out of my food. A cleansed, healed body becomes\r\nfar more efficient at digestion and assimilation; a body that is\r\nkept on a raw food cleansing diet will initially lose weight\r\nrapidly, but eventually weight loss slows to virtually nothing and\r\nthen stabilizes. However, long-term raw fooders are usually thin as\r\ntoothpicks.\r\n\r\nOnce starchy vegetables like potatoes or winter squash, raw or\r\ncooked, or any cereals, raw or cooked, are added to a cleansing\r\ndiet, the detoxification and healing virtually ceases and it becomes\r\nvery easy to maintain or even gain weight, particularly if larger\r\nquantities of more concentrated foods like seeds and nuts are eaten.\r\nThough this diet has ceased to be cleansing, few if any toxins from\r\nmisdigestion will be produced and health is easy to maintain.\r\n\r\n\"Raw fooders\" are usually people who have healed themselves of a\r\nserious diseases and ever after continue to maintain themselves on\r\nunfired food, almost as a matter of religious belief. They have\r\nbecome convinced that eating only raw, unfired food is the key to\r\nextraordinarily long life and supreme good health. When raw fooders\r\nwish to perform hard physical work or strenuous exercise, they'll\r\nconsume raw nuts and some raw grains such as finely-ground oats\r\nsoaked overnight in warm water or deliciously sweet \"Essene bread,\"\r\nmade from slightly sprouted wheat that is then ground wet, made into\r\ncakes, and sun baked at temperatures below about 115 degrees\r\nFahrenheit. Essene bread can be purchased in some health food\r\nstores. However, little or no healing or detoxification can happen\r\nonce concentrated energy sources are added to the diet, even raw\r\nones.\r\n\r\nDuring my days at Great Oaks School I was a raw fooder for some\r\nyears, though I found it very difficult to maintain body heat on raw\r\nfood during chilly, rainy Oregon winters and eventually struck a\r\npersonal compromise where I ate about half my diet raw and the rest\r\nfired. I have listed some books by raw fooders in the Bibliography.\r\nJoe Alexander's is the most fun.\r\n\r\nComplete Recovery Of The Seriously Ill\r\n\r\nIts a virtual certainty that to fully recover, a seriously ill\r\nperson will have to significantly rebuild numerous organs. They have\r\na hard choice: to accept a life of misery, one that the medical\r\ndoctors with drugs and surgery may be able to prolong into an\r\ninterminable hell on earth, or, spend several years working on\r\nreally healing their body, rotating between water fasting, juice or\r\nbroth fasting, extended periods on a cleansing raw food diet, and\r\nperiods of no-cleansing on a more complete diet that includes\r\nmoderate amounts of cooked vegetables and small quantities of cooked\r\ncereals. And even after recovery someone who was quite ill may have\r\nto live the rest of their life on a rather restricted regimen.\r\n\r\nIt is unrealistic to expect one fast to fix everything. The body\r\nwill heal as much as it can in the allotted time, but if a dangerous\r\nillness has not been fully remedied by the first intense fast, a raw\r\nfood diet must be followed for three to six months until weight has\r\nbeen regained, nutritional reserves have been rebuilt and it is safe\r\nto undertake another extended fast. More than two water or juice\r\nfasts a year of thirty continuous days are not recommended nor\r\nshould they be necessary unless the life is in imminent danger and\r\nthere is no other option.\r\n\r\nThe story of Jake's catastrophic illness and almost-cure is a good\r\nexample of this type of program. Jake was from back East. He phoned\r\nme because he had read a health magazine article I had written, his\r\nweak voice faintly describing a desperate condition. He was in a\r\nwheelchair unable to walk, unable to control his legs or arms very\r\nwell, was unable to control his bladder and required a catheter. He\r\nhad poor bowel control, had not the strength to talk much or loudly\r\nand most frightening to him, he was steadily losing weight although\r\nhe was eating large amounts of cooked vegetables and grains. Jake\r\nhad wasted away to 90 pounds at 5' 10\" and looked pathetic when I\r\nfirst saw him wheeled off an airplane at my local airport.\r\n\r\nJake had seen a lot of medical doctors and had variously been\r\ndiagnosed as having chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic (whatever that\r\nis) meningitis, and multiple sclerosis. He had been treated by\r\nvirtually every medical expert and many famous alternative\r\npractitioners, utilizing a host of old and new techniques, all to no\r\navail. He had even tried intravenous chelation therapy and colonics.\r\nIt had also been suggested that he enter a hospital for the\r\ntreatment of eating disorders and/or see a psychiatrist. He had\r\ntried to gain admittance to a number of holistic fasting\r\ninstitutions back east, but they all refused him because they\r\nconsidered the risk was too high to fast a person at such a low body\r\nweight. But I had previously fasted emaciated people like Jake, and\r\nthere was something I liked about his telephone presence. Perhaps\r\nthis is why I foolishly decided I knew better than the other\r\nexperts.\r\n\r\nPeople commonly waste away and die while eating large amounts of\r\nfood. Obviously they are unable to digest or assimilate nutrients or\r\nthey wouldn't be wasting. Eating further increases their toxic\r\nburden from undigested meals, further worsening their already\r\nfailing organs. The real solution is to stop feeding them altogether\r\nso that their digestive functions can heal. In Jake's case, his\r\nbody's nutritional reserves had already become sadly depleted due to\r\npoor absorption over such an extended period, so I could not fast\r\nhim on water. I immediately put Jake on a rich mineral broth\r\nprepared from everything left alive in our garden at the end of\r\nwinter--leaves of kale, endive plants, whole huge splitting Savoy\r\ncabbages, garlic, huge leeks including their green tops, the whole\r\nstew fortified with sea weed. It did not matter too much what\r\nvegetables I used as long as there were lots of leafy greens\r\ncontaining lots of chlorophyll (where the most concentrated mineral\r\nnutrition is located).\r\n\r\nJake was given colonics every day, but had to be carried to the\r\ncolonic table because he could not support his own weight. Whoever\r\nhad given him colonics previously had not accomplished much for I\r\nmust say that Jake had the most foul smelling discharges that I had\r\never encountered in administering over 6,000 colonics over many\r\nyears. It was as if his body was literally rotting from the inside\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAfter 30 days on mineral broth Jake, who really did weigh 90 pounds\r\nwhen he arrived, was only down to 85! When a person already close to\r\nskeletal weight starts fasting, to conserve vital tissue the body\r\ngoes rapidly into a state of profound rest so it uses very little\r\nenergy, thus it loses very little weight each day. This degree of\r\nresting also helps heal abnormal body parts earlier. After one month\r\non mineral broth Jake began to show signs of mineral deficiencies in\r\nthe form of a fine tremor of the hands, and cramps in the feet, so I\r\nput him on mineral supplements too.\r\n\r\nJake was in my house for a long time. At the end of the second month\r\non broth he started two weeks on raw carrot juice with a lot of\r\nchlorophyll added from sources such as algae (spirulina), wheat\r\ngrass juice, alfalfa, etc.. This was followed by two more weeks on\r\nsmall quantities of raw fruits and vegetables, and then followed by\r\ntwo weeks with added steamed vegetables, and finally, he achieved a\r\ndiet which included small amounts of grain, cooked legumes and raw\r\nnuts, plus the fruits and vegetables previously mentioned. Jake\r\nhealth steadily improved. He gained control of his bladder, bowels,\r\nspeech, hands, and legs. He began to exercise in the living room on\r\na stationary bike, and walked slowly up and down our long driveway,\r\npicking daffodils in the beautiful spring weather.\r\n\r\nSadly, though I could help his body to heal it was next to\r\nimpossible to stem the tides of Jake's appetites or to pleasantly\r\nwithstand his tantrums when he was denied; he always wanted more in\r\nterms of quantity, more in terms of variety, and at more frequent\r\nintervals. Though his organs had healed significantly, his digestive\r\ncapacity was not nearly as large as he remembered himself enjoying\r\nbefore he got sick. And never would be. Jake was not happy about the\r\ndietary restrictions necessary for him to retain his newly attained\r\nhealth, and unwilling to stay within the limits of his digestive\r\nsystem's ability to process foods. He had gained weight and was back\r\nup to 120 pounds. It was time for him to go home before I lost my\r\ngood humor.\r\n\r\nJake left with a lot of \"good lucks\" and stern admonitions to stick\r\nto his stringent diet and supplement program. It was a big moment\r\nfor Jake. He had arrived in a wheelchair three months before. Now he\r\nwalked unaided to the airplane, something he had not been able to do\r\nfor two years.\r\n\r\nBack at home Jake had no one courageous enough to set limits for\r\nhim. His immediate family and every one of his brow beaten\r\nassociates were compelled to give him everything that he wanted. So\r\nhis appetite and lack of personal discipline got the better of him.\r\nHe started eating lots of dates and figs. These had been eliminated\r\nfrom his diet because he was unable to process foods which such a\r\nhigh sugar content. He also ate larger and larger quantities of\r\ngrains, nuts and avocados, although I had warned him of specific\r\nquantity limits on rich foods. Most sadly, he returned to enjoying\r\nspaghetti with lots of cheese grated on top. Within months of\r\nleaving my care his paralysis and weakness returned, except that\r\nunfortunately for him, he still retained the ability to assimilate\r\nfood and maintain his body weight. Ironically, the only ultimate\r\nbenefit of his fasting with me was to permit him to suffer a far\r\nlonger existence in a wheelchair without wasting away and escaping\r\ninto death.\r\n\r\nI would be failing my readers if I did not explain why Jake became\r\nill in the first place. Jake had started what grew to become a very\r\nsuccessful chain of spaghetti restaurants with a unique noodles and\r\nsauces made to his own formula. He ate a lot of his own spaghetti\r\nover the years, and had been reared in a good Italian family with\r\nlots of other kinds of rich food. Jake had a reputation for being\r\nable to outeat everybody in terms of quantity and in the amount of\r\ntime spent eating. In childhood, this ability had made his Italian\r\nmother very happy because it showed appreciation for her great\r\nculinary skill.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Jake the adult was still at his core, Jake the spoiled\r\nbrat child, with a bad, unregulated temper. He was in the habit of\r\ndumping his temper on other people whether they needed a helping of\r\nhis angry emotions or not. A lot of people in his employ and in his\r\nextended family tiptoed around Jake, always careful of triggering\r\nhis wrath. At my place as Jake began to get well he began to use his\r\nincreased energy and much stronger voice to demonstrate his poor\r\ncharacter. At meal times Jake would bang the table with a fork hard\r\nenough to leave dents in the wood table top while yelling for more,\r\ncomplaining loudly about the lack of rich sauces and other culinary\r\ndelights he craved. This was a character problem that Jake could not\r\nseem to overcome, even with a lot of intervention from the local\r\nminister on his behalf and my counseling. Jake was a Catholic who\r\nwent to church regularly, but acted like a Christian only while he\r\nwas in church. On some level Jake knew that he was not treating\r\nothers fairly, but he would not change his habitual responses. His\r\nnegative thoughts and actions interfered with his digestive capacity\r\nto the extent that his gluttonous eating habits produced illness, a\r\nvegetative paralyzing illness, but not death. To me this seems\r\nalmost a form of karmic justice.\r\n\r\nIt is common for people who have been very ill for extended periods\r\nof time to realize what a wonderful gift life is and arrive at a\r\nwillingness to do almost anything to have a second chance at doing\r\n\"life\" right. Some succeed with their second chance and some don't.\r\nIf they don't succeed in changing their life and relationships, they\r\nfrequently relapse.\r\n\r\nLuigi Cornaro's left the world his story of sickness and\r\nrejuvenation. His little book may be the world's first alternative\r\nhealing text. It is a classic example of the value of\r\nabstentousness. Had Jake taken this story to heart he would have\r\ntotally recovered. Cornaro was a sixteenth century Venetian\r\nnobleman. He, like Jake the spaghetti baron, was near death at the\r\nyoung age of forty. (Jake was also in his early 40s when he broke\r\ndown.) Cornaro's many doctors were unable to cure him. Finally he\r\nsaw a doctor who understood the principles of natural healing. This\r\nwise physician determined that this illness was caused by a mismatch\r\nbetween Cornaro's limited digestive capacity and the excessive\r\namount of food he was eating. So Cornaro was put on a diet of only\r\n12 ounces of solid food and fourteen ounces of liquid a day. Any\r\ntwelve ounces of any solids he wanted and any fourteen ounces of\r\nliquid. It could be meat and wine, salad or orange juice, no matter.\r\n\r\nCornaro soon regained his health and he continued to follow the diet\r\nuntil the age of 78. His health was so outstanding during this\r\nperiod that people who were much younger in terms of years were\r\nunable to keep up with him. At 78 his friends, worried about how\r\nthin he was (doesn't it always seem that it is your so-called\r\nfriends who always ruin a natural cure) persuaded him to increase\r\nhis daily ration by two ounces a day. His delicate and weak\r\ndigestive system, which had operated perfectly for many years, was\r\nunable to deal with the additional two ounces, and he became very\r\nill after a very short period of over eating.\r\n\r\nWorse, his recent indulgence had even further damaged the organs of\r\ndigestion and to survive Cornaro had to cut his daily ration to\r\neight ounces of solid food and eleven of liquids. On this reduced\r\ndietary he again regained his health and lived to be 100. Cornaro\r\nwrote four books on the value of abstinence or \"sober living\" as he\r\ncalled it, writing the last and perhaps the most interesting at 96\r\nyears of age. Had my patient Jake been able to confine his food\r\nintake to the level of his body's ability to digest, he might still\r\nbe walking and enjoying life. But try as I might I could not make\r\nhim understand. Perhaps he enjoys doing penance in his wheel chair\r\nmore than he would enjoy health and life.\r\n\r\nTissue Losses at Death By Starvation\r\n\r\nFat                   97%\r\nMuscles               31\r\nBlood                 27\r\nLiver                 54\r\nSpleen                67\r\nPancreas              17\r\nSkin                  21\r\nIntestines            18\r\nKidneys               26\r\nLungs                 18\r\nTestes                40\r\nHeart                  3\r\nBrain and Spinal Cord  3\r\nNerves                 3\r\nBone                  14\r\n\r\nFrom Keys, Ancel, Joseph Brozek, Austin Henchel, Olaf Mickelson\r\nand Henry L. Taylor, (1950)_ The Biology of Human Starvation._ Two\r\nVols. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.\r\n\r\nStarvation\r\n\r\nIt is true that ethical medical doctors use the least-risky\r\nprocedure they are allowed to use. But this does not mean there are\r\nno risks to allopathic treatment. The medical doctor justifies\r\ntaking the risks by saying that the risk/reward ratio is the best\r\npossible. Any sick person is already at risk. Life comes with only\r\none guarantee: that none of us gets out of it alive.\r\n\r\nCompared to the risks of allopathic medicine, fasting is a far safer\r\nmethod of treating disease. The oft-repeated scare stories medical\r\ndoctors and their allies circulate about fasting are not true, and\r\nit is important to remember that none of these people portraying\r\nfasting as evil and dangerous have ever fasted themselves--I'll put\r\nmoney on that one. Or, on the slim possibility that someone telling\r\nfasting horror stories did actually not eat for 24 hours (probably\r\nbecause some accident or acute illness prevented them), they had a\r\nterrible experience because they didn't understand the process, were\r\nhighly toxic, and were scared to death the whole time.\r\n\r\nOr worse yet they fasted for a short period with an \"open mind\"--a\r\nvery dangerous state in which to approach anything new. I have found\r\nthrough considerable experience with people professing to have open\r\nminds that the expression \"I'm open minded\" usually means that\r\nsomeone has already made up their mind and new data just passes\r\nstraight through their open mind--in one ear and out the other. Or\r\nsometimes, the phrase \"open mind\" means a person that does not\r\nbelieve any information has reality and is entirely unable to make\r\nup their mind.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly leveled criticism of fasting is that in its\r\nefforts to survive self-imposed starvation the body metabolizes\r\nvital tissue, not just fat, and therefore, fasting is damaging,\r\npotentially fatally damaging. People who tell you this will also\r\ntell you that fasters have destroyed their heart muscle or ruined\r\ntheir nervous system permanently. But this kind of damage happen\r\nonly when a person starves to death or starves to a point very close\r\nto death, not when someone fasts.\r\n\r\nThere is a huge difference between fasting and starvation. Someone\r\nstarving is usually eating, but eating poorly and inadequately,\r\neating scraps of whatever is available such as sugar, white flour,\r\nrancid grease, shoe leather, or even dirt. Frequently a starving\r\nperson is forced to exercise a great deal as they struggle to\r\nsurvive and additionally is highly apprehensive. Or someone starving\r\nto death is confined to a small space, may become severely\r\ndehydrated too and is in terror. Fear is very damaging to the\r\ndigestive process, and to the body in general; fear speeds up the\r\ndestruction of vital tissue. People starve when trekking vast\r\ndistances through wastelands without food to eat, they starved in\r\nconcentration camps, buried in mind disasters, they starve during\r\nfamines and starve while being tortured in prisons.\r\n\r\nUntil water fasting goes on past the point where all fatty tissues\r\nand all abnormal deposits have been burned for fuel and recycled for\r\nthe nutritional elements they contain, vital muscle tissues and\r\norgans are not consumed. And as long as the body contains sufficient\r\nnutritional reserves, vital organs and essential tissues are rebuilt\r\nand maintained. In fact the body has a great deal of intelligence\r\nthat we don't give it credit for. It knows exactly which cells are\r\nessential to survival, which ones are not. The body knows which\r\ncells are abnormal deposits, and it goes to work to metabolize them\r\nfirst. For example, the body recognizes arthritic deposits, cysts,\r\nfibroids, and tumors as offensive parts of the landscape, and\r\nobligingly uses them for foods in preference to anything else. A\r\nstarving (not fasting) body also knows precisely in what order of\r\npriority body cells should be metabolized to minimize risk of death\r\nor permanent disability.\r\n\r\nAfter a starving body has reached skeletal condition, or where some\r\nsmall amount of fat remains but nutritional reserves (vitamins and\r\nminerals) are exhausted and there is insufficient nourishment\r\nforthcoming, the body begins to consume nutrient-rich muscle and\r\norgan tissue in a last-ditch effort to stay alive. Under these dire\r\ncircumstances, the least essential muscles and organs from the\r\nstandpoint of survival are metabolized first. For example, muscles\r\nin the arms and legs would be consumed early in the process, the\r\nheart muscle used only toward the very end. The very last part of\r\nthe body to be metabolized when one is starving and as has come very\r\nclose to death would be the brain and the nervous system.\r\n\r\nStarvation begins where fasting ends, which is when real hunger\r\nbegins. If the return of hunger is ignored whenever it takes place,\r\nwhether it is in 30, 60, or 90 days depending upon body weight and\r\ntype of fast, at that point exactly, not a day before, starvation\r\nbegins very slowly. Usually it takes a considerable period of time\r\nafter that before death occurs. It is important to note that this\r\ndiscussion applies only to the abstention from food, not water.\r\nDeath takes place very quickly in the absence of water.\r\n\r\nThe chart on the previous page shows numerically the phenomenal\r\nability of the body to protect the most essential tissues of the\r\nbody right up to the time of death. If a person fasted for 30 days,\r\nthe average time it takes for the return of hunger in a person that\r\nis not overweight, and then ignored the return of hunger, and\r\ncontinued to abstain from food--if the person could avoid forced\r\nexercise, keep warm, and had enough hydration, it could take as much\r\nas an additional 20 to 60 days to die of starvation! At death the\r\nbody would have experienced losses of 40 to 60 percent of its\r\nstarting body weight. (Ancel Keys et al, 1950) A emaciated person\r\ncan not afford to lose nearly as much weight as an obese person, and\r\ndeath under conditions of starvation will occur earlier. In all\r\ncases of starvation the brain, nerves, heart, lungs, kidneys and\r\nliver remain largely intact and functional to the very end. During a\r\nfast, it is almost impossible to damage essential organs, unless of\r\ncourse the person creates the damage by fears about the process, or\r\nby internalizing the fears of others. If those fears are present,\r\nthe fast should not be attempted.\r\n\r\nWeight Loss By Fasting\r\n\r\nLoss of weight indicates, almost guarantees, that detoxification and\r\nhealing is occurring. I can't stress this too much. Of all the\r\nthings I find my patients seem to misunderstand or forget after\r\nbeing told, it is that they can't heal in a rapid manner without\r\ngetting smaller. This reality is especially hard for the family and\r\nfriends of someone who is fasting, who will say, \"you're looking\r\nterrible dear, so thin. Your skin is hanging on your bones. You're\r\nnot eating enough protein or nutrient food to be healthy and you\r\nmust eat more or you're going to develop serious deficiencies. You\r\ndon't have any energy, you must be getting sicker. You're doing the\r\nwrong thing, obviously. You have less energy and look worse every\r\nday. Go and see a doctor before it is too late.\" To succeed with\r\nfriends like this, a faster has to be a mighty self-determined\r\nperson with a powerful ability to disagree with others.\r\n\r\nMedical personnel claim that rapid weight loss often causes\r\ndangerous deficiencies; these deficiencies force the person to\r\novereat and regain even more weight afterward. This is largely\r\nuntrue, though there is one true aspect to it: a fasted, detoxified\r\nbody becomes a much more efficient digester and assimilator,\r\nextracting a lot more nutrition from the same amount food is used to\r\neat. If, after extended fasting a person returns to eating the same\r\nnumber of calories as they did before; they will gain weight even\r\nmore rapidly than before they stated fasting. When fasting for\r\nweight loss, the only way to keep the weight off is to greatly\r\nreform the diet; to go on, and stay on, a diet made up largely of\r\nnon-starchy, watery fruits and vegetables, limited quantities of\r\ncooked food, and very limited amounts of highly concentrated food\r\nsources like cereals and cooked legumes. Unless, of course, after\r\nfasting, one's lifestyle involves much very hard physical labor or\r\nexercise. I've had a few obese fasters become quite angry with me\r\nfor this reason; they hoped to get thin through fasting and after\r\nthe fast, to resume overeating with complete irresponsibility as\r\nbefore, without weight gain.\r\n\r\nPeople also fear weight loss during fasting because they fear\r\nbecoming anorexic or bulimic. They won't! A person who abstains from\r\neating for the purpose of improving their health, in order to\r\nprevent or treat illness, or even one who fasts for weight loss will\r\nnot develop an eating disorder. Eating disorders mean eating\r\ncompulsively because of a distorted body image. Anorexics and\r\nbulimics have obsessions with the thinner-is-better school of\r\nthought. The anorexic looks at their emaciated frame in the mirror\r\nand thinks they are fat! This is the distorted perception of a very\r\ninsecure person badly in need of therapy. A bulimic, on the other\r\nhand stuffs themselves, usually with bad food, and then purges it by\r\nvomiting, or with laxatives. Anorexics and bulimics are not\r\naccelerating the healing potential of their bodies; these are life\r\nthreatening conditions. Fasters are genuinely trying to enhance\r\ntheir survival potential.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a neurotic individual with a pre-existing eating\r\ndisorder will become obsessed with fasting and colon cleansing as a\r\njustification to legitimize their compulsion. During my career while\r\nmonitoring hundreds of fasters, I've known two of these. I\r\ndiscourage them from fasting or colon cleansing, and refuse to\r\nassist them, because they carry the practices to absurd extremes,\r\nand contribute to bad press about natural medicine by ending up in\r\nthe emergency ward of a hospital with an intravenous feeding tube in\r\ntheir arm.\r\n\r\nCases Beyond The Remedy Of Fasting\r\n\r\nOccasionally, very ill people have a liver that has become so\r\ndegenerated it cannot sustain the burden of detoxification. This\r\norgan is as vital to survival as the brain, heart and lungs. We can\r\nget along with only one kidney, we can live with no spleen, with no\r\ngallbladder, with only small parts of the stomach and intestines,\r\nbut we can not survive without a liver for more than a day or so.\r\nThe liver is the most active organ in the body during\r\ndetoxification. To reach an understanding of detoxification, it\r\nhelps to know just what the liver does for us on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nThe liver is a powerful chemical filter where blood is refined and\r\npurified. The liver passes this cleansed blood out through the\r\nsuperior vena cava, directly to the heart. The blood is then pumped\r\ninto general and systemic circulation, where it reaches all parts of\r\nthe body, delivering nutrition and oxygen at a cellular level. On\r\nits return flow, a large proportion of the depleted blood is\r\ncollected by the gastric, splenic and superior and inferior\r\nmesenteric veins that converge to form the large portal vein which\r\nenters the liver. Thus a massive flow of waste from all the cells of\r\nthe body is constantly flowing into the liver. The huge hepatic\r\nartery also enters the liver to supply oxygen and nutrients with\r\nwhich to sustain the liver cells themselves.\r\n\r\nThe liver is constantly at work refining the blood. It is\r\nsynthesizing, purifying, renovating, washing, filtering, separating,\r\nand detoxifying. It works day and night without stopping. Many\r\ntoxins are broken down by enzymes and their component parts are\r\nefficiently reused in various parts of the body. Some impurities are\r\nfiltered out and held back from the general circulation. These\r\ndebris are collected and stored in the gall bladder, which is a\r\nlittle sack appended to the liver. After a meal, the contents of the\r\ngall bladder (bile) are discharged into the duodenum, the upper part\r\nof the small intestine just beyond the stomach. This bile also\r\ncontains digestive enzymes produced by the liver that permit the\r\nbreakdown of fatty foods in the small intestine.\r\n\r\nSometimes a large flow of bile finds its way into the stomach by\r\npressure or is sucked into the stomach by vomiting. Excessive\r\nbiliary secretion and excretion can also result from overeating,\r\nwhich overcrowds the area. Sometimes colonics or massage can also\r\nstimulate a massive flow of bile. Extremely bitter and irritating,\r\nwhen bile gets into the stomach the person either vomits or wishes\r\nthey could. And after vomiting and experiencing the taste of bile,\r\nwishes they hadn't.\r\n\r\nWhen no food at all enters the system, the blood keeps right on\r\npassing through the liver/filter just as it does when we are eating.\r\nWhen the liver does not have to take care of toxins generated by the\r\ncurrent food intake, each passage through the liver results in a\r\ncleaner blood stream, with the debris decreasing in quantity,\r\nviscosity, and toxicity, until the blood becomes normalized. During\r\nfasting, debris from the gall bladder still pass through the small\r\nintestine and into the large intestine. However, if the bowels do\r\nnot move the toxins in the bile are readsorbed into the blood stream\r\nand get recirculated in an endless loop. This toxic recycling makes\r\na faster feel just terrible, like they had a flu or worse!\r\n\r\nThe bowels rarely move while fasting. During fasting only enemas or\r\ncolonics permit elimination from the large intestine. If done\r\neffectively and frequently, enemas will greatly add to the well\r\nbeing and comfort of the faster. Many times when a faster seems to\r\nbe retracing or experiencing a sudden onset of acute discomfort or\r\nsymptoms, these can be almost immediately relieved by an enema or\r\ncolonic.\r\n\r\nA person with major liver degeneration inevitably dies, with or\r\nwithout fasting, with or without traditional medicine. Significantly\r\nimpaired kidney function can also bring about this same result.\r\nMercifully, death while fasting is usually accomplished relatively\r\nfree of pain, clear of mind and with dignity. That often can not be\r\nsaid of death in a hospital. There are much worse experiences than\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nFasting is not a cure-all. There are some conditions that are beyond\r\nthe ability of the body to heal. Ultimately, old age gets us all.\r\n\r\nDr. Linda Hazzard, one of the greats of natural hygiene, who\r\npracticed Osteopathic medicine in the 1920s, had a useful way of\r\ncategorizing conditions that respond well to fasting. These she\r\nlabeled \"acute conditions,\" and \"chronic degenerative conditions.\" A\r\nthird classification, \"chronic conditions with organic damage,\" does\r\nnot respond to fasting. Acute conditions, are usually inflammations\r\nor infections with irritated tissue, with swelling, redness, and\r\noften copious secretions of mucous and pus, such as colds, flu, a\r\nfirst time case of pneumonia, inflamed joints as in the early stages\r\nof arthritis, etc. These acute conditions usually remedy in one to\r\nthree weeks of fasting. Acute conditions are excellent candidates\r\nfor self-doctoring. Chronic degenerative conditions are more serious\r\nand the patient usually requires supervision. These include\r\nconditions such as cancer, aids, chronic arthritis, chronic\r\npneumonia, emphysema and asthma. Chronic degenerative conditions\r\nusually respond within a month to three months of fasting. The\r\nfasting should be broken up into two or three sessions if the\r\ncondition has not been relieved in one stint of supervised fasting.\r\nEach successive fast will produce some improvement and if a light,\r\nlargely raw-food diet is adhered to between fasts the patient should\r\nnot worsen and should be fairly comfortable between fastings.\r\n\r\nIf there has been major functional damage to an organ as a result of\r\nany of these degenerative conditions, healing will not be complete,\r\nor may be impossible. By organic damage, I mean that a vital part of\r\nthe body has ceased to function due to some degenerative process,\r\ninjury, or surgery--so badly damaged that the cells that make up the\r\norgan can not be replaced.\r\n\r\nI once had a twenty five year old man come to my spa to die in peace\r\nbecause he had been through enough diagnostic procedures in three\r\nhospitals to know that his liver was beyond repair. He had been\r\nworking on an apple farm in between terms at university when he was\r\npoisoned several times with insecticide from an aerial spray on the\r\nwhole orchard. He absorbed so much insecticide that his liver\r\nincurred massive organic damage.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to me his body had reached the point where it was\r\nincapable of digesting, and because of lack of liver function, it\r\nwas incapable of healing while fasting, a condition in which death\r\nis a certainty. He was a Buddhist, did not fear death and did not\r\nwant to be kept alive in agony or in prolonged unconsciousness by\r\nany extraordinary means, nor did he want to die with tubes in every\r\norifice. I was honored to be a supportive participant in his\r\npassing. He died fasting, in peace, and without pain, with a clear\r\nmind that allowed him to consciously prepare for the experience. He\r\nwas not in a state of denial or fear, and made no frantic attempts\r\nto escape the inevitable. He went quietly into that still dark night\r\nwith a tranquil demeanor and a slight smile.\r\n\r\nFortunately, in my many years of practice I had the pleasure of\r\nseeing the majority of the people totally regain their health or at\r\nleast greatly improve it by means of the fasting and healing diets.\r\nMany cancer patients watched with amazement as their tumors\r\ndisappeared before their eyes, many arthritics regained their\r\nfunction, serious skin conditions such as psoriasis disappeared,\r\nmental conditions improved, addictions vanished, fatigue was\r\nreplaced by energy, and fat dissolved revealing the hidden sculpture\r\nbeneath. I will talk more about procedures and the particular\r\nreasons bodies develop specific conditions in later chapters.\r\n\r\nSocial/Cultural/Psychological Obstacles To Fasting\r\n\r\nNumerous attitudes make it difficult to fast or to provide moral\r\nsupport to friends or loved ones that are fasting. Many people\r\nharbor fears of losing weight because they think that if times were\r\nreally tough, if there was a famine or they became ill and lost a\r\nlot of weight they would have no reserves and would certainly\r\nperish. These people have no idea how much fat can be concealed on\r\nan even skinny body, nor of how slowly a skinny body loses weight\r\nwhile fasting. Substantial fat reserves are helpful as\r\nheat-retaining insulation in those rare accidents when someone is\r\ndropped into a cold ocean and must survive until the rescue boat\r\narrives. Being fat might keep a person alive longer who is lost in\r\nthe wilderness awaiting rescue with no supplies, no means of\r\nprocuring food, and no means of keeping warm. On the other hand, fat\r\npeople would have a far harder time walking out of the wilderness.\r\nAnd extensive fat deposits are merely fuel and do not contain\r\nextensive nutritional reserves. An obese person fasting without\r\nsignificant nutritional supplementation would begin starving long\r\nbefore they became really skinny. On the balance, carrying excess\r\nweight is a far greater liability than any potential prosurvival\r\naspects it might have.\r\n\r\nThere are other attitudes associated with weight loss that make it\r\ndifficult for people to fast. People hold rather stereotypical\r\nnotions about what constitutes an attractive person; usually it\r\ninvolves having some meat on ones bones. Hollywood and Hugh Hefner\r\nhave both influenced the masses to think that women should have\r\nhourglass figures with large, upthrust, firm breasts. Since breasts\r\nare almost all useless fatty tissue supporting some milk-producing\r\nglands that do not give a breast much volume except when engorged,\r\nmost women fasters loose a good percentage of their breast mass. If\r\nthe fast is extensive, there should also develop an impressive\r\nshowing of ribs and hip bones; these are not soft and cuddly.\r\nHusbands, lovers, parents, and friends frequently point out that you\r\ndon't look good this way and exhort you to put on weight. Most\r\npeople think pleasantly plump is healthy.\r\n\r\nSkinny men, especially those who had lost a lot of weight during an\r\nillness, are pressured by associates to put on weight to prove that\r\nthey are healthy. I had a client who was formerly a college varsity\r\nfootball player. Before his illness he had lifted weights and looked\r\nlike a hunk. His family and friends liked to see him that way and\r\njustifiably so. Then he got seriously ill. On a long extended\r\nhealing diet he lost a significant amount of weight and seemed down\r\nright skinny, causing all who knew him well and cared about him to\r\ntempt him with all kinds of scrumptious delicacies from the best of\r\nkitchens. But this case was like Luigi Cornaro, a man who never\r\nagain could look like a hunk. His \"friends\" made an absolutely\r\nnecessary change in life style and appearance far more difficult\r\nthan it was already. My client was torn between a desire to please\r\nothers, and a desire to regain and retain his health. This problem a\r\nsick person doesn't need.\r\n\r\nIf you have the independence to consider following an alternative\r\nmedical program in a culture that highly values conformity and\r\nagreement, you are also going to have to defend your own course of\r\nself-determined action based on the best available data that you\r\nhave. But fasters are usually in fragile emotional condition, so I\r\nadvise my clients who are subjected to this kind of pressure to beg\r\ntheir friends and associates to refrain from saying anything if they\r\ncan't support the course of action you have chosen. After this, if\r\nfriends or relatives are still incapable of saying nothing (even\r\nnon-verbally), it is important to exclude them from your life until\r\nyou have accomplished your health goals, have regained some weight\r\nand have returned to eating a maintenance diet, rather than getting\r\nskinnier on a healing one.\r\n\r\nThe very worst aspect of our culture's eating programming is that\r\npeople have been wrongfully taught that when ill they must eat to\r\nkeep up their strength. Inherent in this recommendation is an\r\nunstated belief that when the body is weakened by a disease state,\r\nthe weakness can somehow be overcome with food, and that the body\r\nneeds this food to kill the virus, bacteria, or invading yeast, and\r\nuses the protein to heal or rebuild tissue. Sadly, the exact\r\nopposite is the case. Disease organisms feed and multiply on the\r\ntoxic waste products of misdigestion, and the body is unable to\r\ndigest well when it is weak or ill.\r\n\r\nThere's an old saying about this: \"feed a cold, starve a fever.\"\r\nMost people think this saying means you should eat when you have a\r\ncold. What the saying really means is if you feed a cold then you\r\nwill soon have to starve a fever. Protein foods especially are not\r\ndigested by a diseased body, and as mentioned before, the waste\r\nproducts of protein indigestion are especially poisonous. That is\r\nall the body needs when it is already down, another load of poison\r\nwhich it can't eliminate due to weakness and enervation.\r\n\r\nWeight loss is usually associated with illness, as it should be! In\r\ntimes of acute illness an otherwise healthy body loses its appetite\r\nfor food because it is prosurvival to stop eating. It is very hard\r\nto coax a sick animal to eat. Their bodies, not controlled by a mind\r\nfull of complex learned responses and false ideas, automatically\r\nknow that fasting is nature's method of healing. Contrary to popular\r\nunderstanding, digestion, assimilation, and elimination require the\r\nexpenditure of considerable energy. This fact may contradict the\r\nreader's experience because everyone has become tired when they have\r\nworked a long time without eating, and then experienced the lift\r\nafter eating. But an ill body cannot digest efficiently so instead\r\nof providing energy extracted from foods, the body is further\r\nburdened by yet another load of toxic material produced by fermented\r\nand putrefied food. This adds insult to injury in a sick body that\r\nis already drowning in its own garbage.\r\n\r\nWorse, during illness most available vital force is already\r\nredirected into healing; it is not available for digestion. It is\r\nimportant to allow a sick body to proceed with healing and not to\r\nobstruct the process with unnecessary digestion or suppress the\r\nsymptoms (which actually are the healing efforts) with drugs. If you\r\nhave an acute illness, and you stop all food intake except for pure\r\nwater and herb teas, and perhaps some vegetable broth, or dilute\r\nnon-sweet juice, you have relieved your body of an immense effort.\r\nInstead of digesting, the body goes to work on catching up on\r\nhealing. The body can and will almost inevitably heal itself if the\r\nsick person will have faith in it, cooperate with the body's efforts\r\nby allowing the symptoms of healing to exist, reduce or eliminate\r\nthe intake of food to allow the body to marshal its energies,\r\nmaintain a positive mental attitude and otherwise stay out of the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMany people intensely dread missing even one meal. These folks\r\nusually are and have been so toxic that their bodies had been\r\nstashing uneliminated toxins in their fat for years. They are\r\nusually so addicted to caffeine, cigarettes, alcohol, and so forth,\r\nthat when they had fasted, even briefly, their bodies were forced to\r\ndip into highly-polluted fat reserves while simultaneously the body\r\nbegins withdrawal. People like this who try to fast experience\r\nhighly unpleasant symptoms including headache, irritability,\r\ninability to think or concentrate, blurred vision, profound fatigue,\r\naches, etc. Most of these symptoms come from low blood sugar, but\r\ncombined with the toxins being released from fat and combined with\r\ngoing through multiple addictive withdrawals, the discomforts are\r\nmore than most people are willing to tolerate. Fasting on juice is\r\nmuch more realistic for cases like this. It is little wonder that\r\nwhen a hygienist suggests a fast to improve health, this type of\r\ncase asserts positively that fasting is quite impossible, they have\r\ntried it, it is absolutely terrible and know that they can't do it.\r\n\r\nThis rejection is partly due to a cultural expectation (one\r\nreinforced by western medicine) that all unpleasant symptoms should\r\nbe avoided or suppressed. To voluntarily experience unpleasant\r\nsensations such as those mentioned above is more than the ordinary\r\ntimid person will subject themselves to, even in order to regain\r\nhealth. They will allow surgery, drugs with violent and dangerous\r\nside effects, painful and invasive testing procedures and\r\nradiation--all unpleasant and sometimes extremely uncomfortable.\r\nThese therapies are accepted because someone else with authority is\r\ndoing it to them. And, they have been told that it they don't submit\r\nthey will not ever feel better and probably will die in the near\r\nfuture. Also people think that they have no alternative, that the\r\nexpert in front of them knows what is best, so they feel relieved to\r\nhave been relieved of the responsibility for their own condition and\r\nits treatment.\r\n\r\nPreventative Fasting\r\n\r\nDuring the years it takes for a body to degenerate enough to prompt\r\na fast, the body has been storing up large quantities of unprocessed\r\ntoxins in the cells, tissues, fat deposits, and organs. The body in\r\nits wisdom will always choose to temporarily deposit overwhelming\r\namounts of toxins somewhere harmless rather than permit the blood\r\nsupply to become polluted or to use secondary elimination routes. A\r\nbody will use times when the liver is less burdened to eliminate\r\nthese stored toxic debris. The hygienists' paradigm asserts that the\r\nmanifestation of symptoms or illness are all by themselves,\r\nabsolute, unassailable proof that further storage of toxic wastes in\r\nthe cells, tissues, fat deposits, and organs is not possible and\r\nthat an effort toward elimination is absolutely necessary. Thus the\r\nfirst time a person fasts a great quantity of toxins will normally\r\nbe released. Being the resident of a body when this is happening can\r\nbe quite uncomfortable. For this reason alone, preventative fasting\r\nis a very wise idea.\r\n\r\nBefore the body becomes critically ill, clean up your reserve fuel\r\nsupply (fat deposits) by burning off some accumulated fat that is\r\nrich in toxic deposits and then replace it with clean, non-toxic fat\r\nthat you will make while eating sensibly. If you had but fasted\r\nprophylactically as a preventative or health-creating measure before\r\nyou became seriously ill, the initial detoxification of your body\r\ncould have been accomplished far more comfortably, while you were\r\nhealthy, while your vital force was high and while your body\r\notherwise more able to deal with detoxification.\r\n\r\nEach time you fast, even if it is only one day, you allow your body\r\nto go through a partial detox, and each time it becomes easier and\r\nmore comfortable than the last time. The body learns how to fast.\r\nEach time you fast it, your body slips into a cleansing mode more\r\nquickly, and each time you fast you lighten the load of stored\r\ntoxins. Perhaps you have already eliminated the caffeine your body\r\nhad stored, which frequently causes severe headaches on withdrawal,\r\nnot to mention fatigue. It certainly helps to have this behind you\r\nbefore you go on to the elimination of other irritating substances.\r\nMany people have gone through alcohol or tobacco withdrawal, and\r\nunderstand that it is very unpleasant, and also that it must be done\r\nin the pursuit of health. Why not withdraw from the rest of the\r\nirritating and debilitating substances we take into our system on an\r\nongoing basis, and why not grit your way through the eliminative\r\nprocess, withdraw, from food addictions such as sugar or salt, and\r\nfrom foods that you may be allergic to like wheat, dairy products or\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nIt is very wise to invest in your own insurance plan by\r\nsystematically detoxifying while you are still healthy. Plan it into\r\nyour life, when it is convenient, such as once a week on Sunday, or\r\neven once a month on a quiet day. Take a few days of vacation, go to\r\na warm, beautiful place and devote part or all of it to cleansing.\r\nTreat yourself by taking an annual trip to Hawaii, fasting at a\r\nhotel on the beach--do whatever it takes to motivate yourself. And\r\nconsider this: vacations are enormously cheaper when you stay out of\r\nrestaurants.\r\n\r\nIf you have accustomed your body to 24 hour fasts, then you can work\r\non 48 hour fasts, and over time work up to 72 hour fasts, all on a\r\ncontinuum. You may find it becoming increasingly comfortable,\r\nperhaps even pleasant, something you look forward to. Fasting a\r\nrelatively detoxified body feels good, and people eventually really\r\nget into the clean, light, clear headed, perhaps spiritually aware\r\nstate that goes along with it.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, fasting when you are sick is much more difficult\r\nbecause your vitality or vital force is very low, you already have\r\nno energy, and probably have unpleasant symptoms that must be dealt\r\nwith at the same time. There may be the added stress of being forced\r\ninto a cleanse because you are too nauseous to eat. Most people let\r\ntheir health go until they are forced into dealing with it; they are\r\ntoo busy living, so why bother.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that our body does age, and over time becomes less able\r\nto deal with insults; the accumulated effect of insults and aging\r\neventually leads most of us to some serious degenerative illness.\r\nNormally this begins happening around age 50 if not sooner. Some of\r\nus that were gifted with good genes or what I call \"a good start\"\r\nmay have reached the age of 60 or 75 or even 90 without serious\r\nillness, but those people are few and far between. Why not tip the\r\nscales in your favor by preventing or staving off health problems\r\nwith systematic detoxification at your own convenience.\r\n\r\nClimb into the drivers seat and start to take control and gain\r\nconfidence in your own ability to deal with your body, your own\r\nhealth, and your own life. When it gets right down to the bottom\r\nline, there is really only one thing in the world that is really\r\nyours, and that is your life. Take control and start managing it.\r\nThe reward will be a more qualitative life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Four\r\n\r\nColon Cleansing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom The Hygienic Dictionary\r\n\r\nAutointoxication. [1] the accumulations on the bowel wall become a\r\nbreeding ground for unhealthy bacterial life forms. The heavy mucus\r\ncoating in the colon thickens and becomes a host for putrefaction.\r\nThe blood capillaries to the colon begin to pick up the toxins,\r\npoisons and noxious debris as it seeps through the bowel wall. All\r\ntissues and organs of the body are now taking on toxic substances.\r\nHere is the beginning of true autointoxication on a physiological\r\nlevel. _Bernard Jensen, Tissue Cleansing Through Bowel Management._\r\n[2] All maladies are due to the lack of certain food principles,\r\nsuch as mineral salts or vitamins, or to the absence of the normal\r\ndefenses of the body, such as the natural protective flora. When\r\nthis occurs, toxic bacteria invade the lower alimentary canal, and\r\nthe poisons thus generated pollute the bloodstream and gradually\r\ndeteriorate and destroy every tissue, gland and organ of the body.\r\n_Sir Arbuthnot Lane. _[3] The common cause of gastro-intestinal\r\nindigestion is enervation and overeating When food is not digested,\r\nit becomes a poison. Dr. John.H. Tilden, Impaired Health: Its Cause\r\nand Cure, 1921. [4] a clogging up of the large intestine by a\r\nbuilding up (on) the bowel wall to such an extent that feces can\r\nhardly pass through. autointoxication is a direct result of\r\nintestinal constipation. Faulty nutrition is a major underlying\r\nfactor in constipation. The frequency or quantity of fecal\r\nelimination is not an indication of the lack of constipation in the\r\nbowel._ Bernard Jensen, Tissue Cleansing Through Bowel Management._\r\n\r\nI am not a true believer in any single healing method or system. I\r\nfind much truth in many schools and use a wide variety of\r\ntechniques. The word for my inclination is eclectic.\r\n\r\nThe most effective medicine in my arsenal is water fasting followed\r\nclosely in potency by other, less rigorous detoxifying diets. Colon\r\ncleansing ranks next in healing power. In fact it is difficult to\r\nseparate colon cleansing from fasting because detoxification\r\nprograms should always be accompanied by colon cleansing. Further\r\ndown the scale of efficatiousness comes dietary reform to eliminate\r\nallergic reactions and to present the body with foods it is capable\r\nof digesting without creating toxemia. Last, and usually least in\r\neffectiveness in my arsenal, are orthotropic substances (in the form\r\nof little pills and capsules) commonly known as vitamins or food\r\nsupplements.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, acceptance of these methods by my clients runs in\r\nexact opposition to their effectiveness. People prefer taking\r\nvitamins because they seem like the allopaths' pills, taking pills\r\ndemands little or no responsibility for change. The least popular\r\nprescription I can write is a monodiet of water for several weeks or\r\na month. Yet this is my most powerful medicine.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to resolve many health complaints without fasting,\r\nsimply by cleansing the colon and regaining normal lower bowel\r\nfunction. Colonics take little personal effort and are much easier\r\nto get people to accept than fasting. So I can fully understand how\r\nperfectly honest and ethical naturopaths have developed obsessions\r\nwith colon cleansing. Some healers have loudly and repeatedly (and\r\nwrongly) proclaimed that constipation is the sole cause of disease,\r\nand thus, the only real cure for any illness is colon cleansing.\r\n\r\nEven though it is possible to have a lot of successes with the\r\nsimple (though unpleasant to administer) technique of colon\r\ncleansing, degenerated lower bowels are the only cause of disease. I\r\nprefer to use bowel cleansing as an adjunct to more complete healing\r\nprograms. However, old classics of hygiene and even a few new books\r\nstrongly make the case for colonics. Some of these books are\r\nentirely one-sided, single-cause single-cure approaches, and sound\r\nconvincing to the layperson. For this reason, I think I should take\r\na few paragraphs and explain why some otherwise well-intentioned\r\nhealth professionals have overly-advocated colonics (and other\r\npractices as well).\r\n\r\nMost Diseases Cure Themselves\r\n\r\nIf you ask any honest medical doctor how they cure diseases, they\r\nwill tell you that most acute disease conditions and a smaller,\r\nthough significant percentage (probably a majority) of chronic\r\ndisease conditions are self-limiting and will, given time, get\r\nbetter all by themselves. So for most complaints, the honest\r\nallopathic doctor sees their job as giving comfort and easing the\r\nseverity of the symptoms until a cure happens.\r\n\r\nThis same scenario, when viewed from a hygienist's perspective, is\r\nthat almost all acute and many chronic conditions are simply the\r\nbody's attempt to handle a crisis of toxemia. For two reasons the\r\ncurrent crisis will probably go away by itself. The positive reason\r\nis that the toxic overload will be resolved: the person changes\r\ntheir dietary habits or the stressor that temporarily lowered their\r\nvital force and produced enervation is removed, then digestion\r\nimproves and the level of self-generated toxins is reduced. The\r\nnegative reason for a complaint to \"cure\" itself is that the\r\nsuffering person's vital force drops below the level that the\r\nsymptom can be manifested and the complaint goes away because a new,\r\nmore serious disease is developing.\r\n\r\nI view this second possibility as highly undesirable because strong,\r\nhealthy bodies possessing a high degree of vital force are able to\r\neliminate toxins rather violently, frequently producing very\r\nuncomfortable symptoms that are not life-threatening. However, as\r\nthe vital force drops, the body changes its routes of secondary\r\nelimination and begins using more centrally located vital organs and\r\nsystems to dispose of toxemia. This degeneration producing less\r\nunpleasant symptoms, but in the long run, damages essential organs\r\nand moves the person closer to their final disease.\r\n\r\nA young vigorous body possessing a large degree of vital force will\r\nalmost always route surplus toxins through skin tissues and\r\nskin-like mucus membranes, producing repeated bouts of sinusitis, or\r\nasthma, or colds, or a combination of all these. Each acute\r\nmanifestation will \"cure\" itself by itself eventually. But\r\neventually the body's vital force can no longer create these\r\naggressive cleansing phenomena and the toxemia begins to go deeper.\r\nWhen the allopathic doctor gets a patient complaining of sinusitis,\r\nthey know they will eventually get a cure. The \"cure\" however, might\r\nwell be a case of arthritis.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate reality tends to make young, idealistic physicians\r\nbecome rather disillusioned about treating degenerative conditions\r\nbecause the end result of all their efforts is, in the end, death\r\nanyway. The best they can do is to alleviate suffering and to a\r\ndegree, prolong life. The worst they can do is to prolong suffering.\r\n\r\nThus, the physicians main job is to get the patient to be patient,\r\nto wait until the body corrects itself and stops manifesting the\r\nundesired symptom. Thus comes the prime rule of all humane medicine:\r\nfirst of all, do no harm! If the doctor simply refrains from making\r\nthe body worse, it will probably get better by itself. But the\r\npatient, rarely resigned to quiet suffering, comes in demanding fast\r\nrelief, demanding a cure. In fact, if the patient were resigned to\r\nquiet suffering they would not consult a doctor. So if the doctor\r\nwants to keep this patient and make a living they must do something.\r\nIf that something the doctor must do does little or no harm and\r\nbetter yet, can also alleviate the symptoms, the doctor is\r\npracticing good medicine and will have a very high cure rate and be\r\nfinancially successful if they have a good bedside manner. This kind\r\nof doctor may be allopathic and/or \"natural,\" may use herbs or\r\npractice homeopathy.\r\n\r\nThe story of Dr. Jennings, a very successful and famous or infamous\r\n(depending on your viewpoint) physician, who practiced in\r\nConnecticut in the early 1800s exemplifies this type of approach.\r\n\r\nDr. Jennings had his own unique medicines. Their composition was of\r\nhis own devising, and were absolutely secret. He had pills and\r\ncolored bitter drops of various sorts that were compounded himself\r\nin his own pharmacy. Dr. Jennings' patients generally recovered and\r\nhad few or no complications. This must be viewed in contrast to the\r\npractices of his fellow doctors of that era, whose black bags were\r\nfull of mercury and arsenic and strychnine, whose practices included\r\nobligatory bleeding. These techniques and medicines \"worked\" by\r\npoisoning the body or by reducing its blood supply and thus lowering\r\nits vital force, ending the body's ability to manifest the\r\nundesirable symptom. If the poor patient survived being victimized\r\nby their own physician, they were tough enough to survive both their\r\ndisease and the doctor's cure. Typically, the sick had many, lengthy\r\ncomplications, long illnesses, and many \"setbacks\" requiring many\r\nvisits, earning the physician a great living.\r\n\r\nDr. Jennings operated differently. He would prescribe one or two\r\nsecret medicines from his black bag and instruct the patient to stay\r\nin bed, get lots of rest, drink lots of water, eat little and\r\nlightly, and continue taking the medicine until they were well. His\r\ncure rate was phenomenal. Demand they might, but Dr. Jennings would\r\nnever reveal what was in his pills and vials. Finally at the end of\r\nhis career, to instruct his fellow man, Dr. Jennings confessed. His\r\npills were made from flour dough, various bitter but harmless herbal\r\nsubstances, and a little sugar. His red and green and black\r\ntinctures, prescribed five or ten drips at a time mixed in a glass\r\nof water several times daily, were only water and alcohol, some\r\ncolorant and something bitter tasting, but harmless. Placebos in\r\nother words.\r\n\r\nUpon confessing, Dr. Jennings had to run for his life. I believe he\r\nended up retiring on the western frontier, in Indiana. Some of his\r\nformer patients were extremely angry because they had paid good\r\nmoney, top dollar for \"real\" medicines, but were given only flour\r\nand water. The fact that they got better didn't seem to count.\r\n\r\nIf the physicians curative procedure suppresses the symptom and/or\r\nlowers the vital force with toxic drugs or surgery, (either result\r\nwill often as not end the complaint) the allopathic doctor is\r\npracticing bad medicine. This doctor too will have a high cure rate\r\nand a good business (if they have an effective bedside manner)\r\nbecause their drugs really do make the current symptoms vanish very\r\nrapidly. Additionally, their practice harmonizes with a common but\r\nvicious dramatization of many people which goes: when a body is\r\nmalfunctioning, it is a bad body and needs to be punished. So lets\r\npunish it with poisons and if that don't work, lets really punish it\r\nby cutting out the offending part.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the physician can do something that will do no harm but\r\nraises the vital force and/or lowers the level of toxemia, this\r\ndoctor will have a genuine cure rate higher than either of the two\r\ntechniques. Why does raising the vital force help? Because it\r\nreduces enervation, improves the digestion, lowers the creation of\r\nnew toxins and improves the function of the organs of elimination,\r\nalso reducing the toxic overload that is causing the complaint.\r\n\r\nTechniques that temporarily and quickly raise the vital force\r\ninclude homeopathy, chiropractic, vitamin therapy, massage,\r\nacupuncture and acupressure and many more spiritually oriented\r\npractices. Healers who use these approaches and have a good bedside\r\nmanner can have a very good business, they can have an\r\nespecially-profitable practice if they do nothing to lower the level\r\nof toxemia being currently generated. Their patients do experience\r\nprompt relief but must repeatedly take the remedy. This makes for\r\nsatisfied customers and a repeat business.\r\n\r\nThe best approach of all focuses on reducing the self-generated\r\nlevel of toxemia, cleansing to remove deposits of old toxemia,\r\nrebuilding the organs of elimination and digestion to prevent the\r\nformation of new toxemia, and then, to alleviate the current\r\nsymptoms and make it easier for the patient to be patient while\r\ntheir body heals, the healer raises artificially and temporarily the\r\nvital force with vitamins, massage, acupressure, etc. This wise and\r\nbenevolent physician is going to have the highest cure rate among\r\nthose wise patients who will accept the prescription, but will not\r\nmake as much money because the patients permanently get better and\r\nno longer need a physician. There's not nearly as much repeat\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nColonics are one of the best types of medicine. They clean up\r\ndeposits of old toxemia (though there are sure to be other deposits\r\nin the body's tissues colonics do not touch). Colon cleansing\r\nreduces the formation of new toxemia from putrefying fecal matter\r\n(but dietary reform is necessary to maximize this benefit). Most\r\nnoticeable to the patient, a colonic immediately alleviates current\r\nsymptoms by almost instantly reducing the current toxic load. A\r\nwell-done enema or colonic is such a powerful technique that a\r\nsingle one will often make a severe headache vanish, make an\r\nonsetting cold go away, end a bout of sinusitis, end an asthmatic\r\nattack, reduce the pain of acute arthritic inflammation, reduce or\r\nstop an allergic reaction. Enemas are also thrifty: they are\r\nself-administered and can prevent most doctor's visits seeking\r\nrelief for acute conditions.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the colon itself, including chronic constipation,\r\ncolitis, diverteculitis, hemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome, and\r\nmucous colitis, are often cured solely by an intensive series of\r\nseveral dozen colonics given close together. Contrary to popular\r\nbelief, many people think that if they have dysentery or other forms\r\nof loose stools that a colonic is the last thing they need.\r\nSurprisingly, a series of colonics will eliminate many of these\r\nconditions as well. People with chronic diarrhea or loose stools are\r\nusually very badly constipated. This may seem a contradiction in\r\nterms but it will be explained shortly.\r\n\r\nA century ago there was much less scientific data about the\r\nfunctioning of the human body. Then it was easy for a\r\nhygienically-oriented physician to come to believe that colonics\r\nwere the single best medicine available. The doctor practicing\r\nnothing but colonics will have a very high rate of cure and a lot of\r\nvery satisfied clients. Most importantly, this medicine will have\r\ndone no harm.\r\n\r\nThe Repugnant Bowel\r\n\r\nI don't know why, but people of our culture have a deep-seated\r\nreluctance to relate to the colon or it's functions. People don't\r\nwant to think about the colon or personally get involved with it by\r\ngiving themselves enemas or colonics. They become deeply embarrassed\r\nat having someone else do it for them. People are also shy about\r\nfarts, and most Americans have a hard time not smiling or reacting\r\nin some way when someone in their presence breaks wind, although the\r\npolite amongst us pretend that we didn't notice. Comedians usually\r\nsucceed in getting a laugh out of an audience when they come up with\r\na fart or make reference to some other bowel function. People don't\r\nreact the same way to urinary functions or discharges, although\r\nthese also may have an unpleasant odor and originate from the same\r\n\"private\" area.\r\n\r\nWhen I first mention to clients that they need a minimum of 12\r\ncolonics or many more enemas than 12 during a fasting or cleansing\r\nprogram they are inevitably shocked. To most it seems that no one in\r\ntheir right mind would recommend such a treatment, and that I must\r\ncertainly be motivated by greed or some kind of a psychological\r\nquirk. Then I routinely show them reproductions of X-rays of the\r\nlarge intestine showing obvious loss of normal structure and\r\nfunction resulting from a combination of constipation, the effects\r\nof gravity, poor abdominal muscle tone, emotional stress, and poor\r\ndiet. In the average colon more than 50% of the hastrum (muscles\r\nthat impel fecal matter through the organ) are dysfunctional due to\r\nloss of tone caused by impaction of fecal matter and/or constriction\r\nof the large intestine secondary to stress (holding muscular tension\r\nin the abdominal area) and straining during bowel movement.\r\n\r\nA typical diseased colon\r\n\r\nThe average person also has a prolapsed (sagging) transverse colon,\r\nand a distorted misplaced ascending and descending colon. I took a\r\ncourse in colon therapy before purchasing my first colonic machine.\r\nThe chiropractor teaching the class required all of his patients\r\nscheduled for colonics to take a barium enema followed by an X-ray\r\nof their large intestine prior to having colonics and then make\r\nsubsequent X-rays after each series of 12 colonics. Most of his\r\npatients experienced so much immediate relief they voluntarily took\r\nat least four complete series, or 48 colonics, before their X-rays\r\nbegan to look normal in terms of structure. It also took about the\r\nsame number, 48 colonics, for the patients to notice a significant\r\nimprovement in the function of the colon. In reviewing over 10,000\r\nX-rays taken at his clinic prior to starting colonics, the\r\nchiropractor had seen only two normal colon X-rays and these were\r\nfrom farm boys who grew up eating simple foods from the garden and\r\ndoing lots of hard work.\r\n\r\nThe X-rays showed that it took a minimum of 12 colon treatments to\r\nbring about a minimal but observable change in the structure of the\r\ncolon in the desired direction, and for the patient to begin to\r\nnotice that bowel function was improving, plus the fact that they\r\nstarted to feel better.\r\n\r\nA Healthy Colon\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view the most amazing part of this whole experience\r\nwas that the chiropractor did not recommend any dietary changes\r\nwhatsoever. His patients were achieving great success from colonics\r\nalone. I had thought dietary changes would be necessary to avoid\r\nhaving the same dismal bowel condition return. I still think\r\ncolonics are far more effective if people are on a cleansing diet\r\ntoo. However, I was delighted to see the potential for helping\r\npeople through colonics.\r\n\r\nFor me, the most interesting part of this colonic school was that I\r\npersonally was required to have my own barium enema and X-ray. I was\r\nprivately certain that mine would look normal, because after all, I\r\nhad been on a raw food diet for six years, and done considerable\r\namount of fasting, all of which was reputed to repair a civilized\r\ncolon. Much to my surprise my colon looked just as mangled and\r\ndysfunctional as everyone else's', only somewhat worse because it\r\nhad a loop in the descending colon similar to a cursive letter \"e\"\r\nwhich doctors call a volvulus. Surgeons like to cut volvululii out\r\nbecause they frequently cause bowel obstructions. It seemed quite\r\nunfair. All those other people with lousy looking colons had been\r\neating the average American diet their whole life, but I had been so\r\n'pure!'\r\n\r\nOn further reflection I remembered that I had a tendency toward\r\nconstipation all through my childhood and young adulthood, and that\r\nduring my two pregnancies the pressure of the fetus on an already\r\nconstipated bowel had made it worse resulting in the distorted\r\nstructure seen in the X-ray. This experience made it very clear that\r\nfasting, cleansing diets, and corrected diet would not reverse\r\ndamage already done. Proper diet and fasting would however, prevent\r\nthe condition of the colon from getting any worse than it already\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nI then realized that I had just purchased the very tool I needed to\r\ncorrect my own colon, and I was eager to get home to get started on\r\nit. I had previously thought that I was just going to use this\r\nmachine for my patients, because they had been asking for this kind\r\nof an adjunct to my services for some time. I ended up giving myself\r\nover a hundred colonics at the rate of three a week over many\r\nmonths. I then out of curiosity had another barium enema and X-ray\r\nto validate my results. Sure enough the picture showed a colon that\r\nlooked far more 'normal' with no vulvulus. That little \"e\" had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nWhat Is Constipation?\r\n\r\nMost people think they are not constipated because they have a bowel\r\nmovement almost every day, accomplished without straining. I have\r\neven had clients tell me that they have a bowel movement once a\r\nweek, and they are quite certain that they are not constipated. The\r\nmost surprising thing to novice fasters is that repeated enemas or\r\ncolonics during fasting begins to release many pounds of undeniably\r\nreal, old, caked fecal matter and/or huge mucus strings. The\r\nfirst-time faster can hardly believe these were present. These old\r\nfecal deposits do not come out the first time one has enemas or\r\nnecessarily the fifth time. And all of them will not be removed by\r\nthe tenth enema. But over the course of extended fasting or a long\r\nspell of light raw food eating with repeated daily enemas, amazing\r\nchanges do begin to occur. It seems that no one who has eaten a\r\ncivilized diet has escaped the formation of caked deposits lining\r\nthe colon's walls, interfering with its function. This material does\r\nnot respond to laxatives or casually administered enemas.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has not actually seen (and smelled) what comes out of an\r\n\"average\" apparently healthy person during colonics will really\r\nbelieve it could happen or can accurately imagine it. Often there\r\nare dark black lumpy strings, lumps, or gravel, evil smelling discs\r\nshaped like sculpted hemispheres similar to the pockets lining the\r\nwall of the colon itself. These discs are rock-hard and may come out\r\nlooking like long black braids. There may also be long tangled\r\nstrings of gray/brown mucous, sheets and flakes of mucous, and worse\r\nyet, an occasional worm (tape worm) or many smaller ones. Once\r\nconfronted however, it is not hard to imagine how these fecal rocks\r\nand other obnoxious debris interfere with the proper function of the\r\ncolon. They make the colon's wall rigid and interfere with\r\nperistalsis thus leading to further problems with constipation, and\r\ninterfere with adsorption of nutrients.\r\n\r\nOur modern diet is by its \"de-\"nature, very constipating. In the\r\ntrenches of the First World War, cheese was given the name 'chokem\r\nass' because the soldiers eating this as a part of their daily\r\nration developed severe constipation. Eaten by itself or with other\r\nwhole foods, moderate amounts of cheese may not produce health\r\nproblems in people who are capable of digesting dairy products. But\r\ncheese when combined with white flour becomes especially\r\nconstipating. White bread or most white-flour crackers contain a lot\r\nof gluten, a very sticky wheat protein that makes the bread bind\r\ntogether and raise well. But white flour is lacking the bran, where\r\nmost of the fiber is located. And many other processed foods are\r\nmissing their fiber.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter I briefly showed how digestion works by\r\nfollowing food from the mouth to the large intestine. To fully grasp\r\nwhy becoming constipated is almost a certainty in our civilization a\r\nfew more details are required. Food leaving the small intestine is\r\ncalled chyme, a semi-liquid mixture of fiber, undigested bits,\r\nindigestible bits, and the remains of digestive enzymes. Chyme is\r\npropelled through the large intestine by muscular contractions. The\r\nlarge intestine operates on what I dub the \"chew chew train\"\r\nprinciple, where the most recent meal you ate enters the large\r\nintestine as the caboose (the last car of a train) and helps to push\r\nout the train engine (the car at the front that toots), which in a\r\nhealthy colon should represent the meal eaten perhaps twelve hours\r\nearlier. The muscles in the colon only contract when they are\r\nstretched, so it is the volume of the fecal matter stretching the\r\nlarge intestine that triggers the muscles to push the waste material\r\nalong toward the rectum and anus.\r\n\r\nEating food lacking fiber greatly reduces the volume of the chyme\r\nand slows peristalsis. But moving through fast or slow, the colon\r\nstill keeps on doing another of its jobs, which is to transfer the\r\nwater in the chime back into the bloodstream, reducing dehydration.\r\nSo the longer chime remains in the colon, the dryer and harder and\r\nstickier it gets. That's why once arrived at the \"end of the tracks\"\r\nfecal matter should be evacuated in a timely manner before it gets\r\nto dry and too hard to be moved easily. Some constipated people do\r\nhave a bowel movement every day but are evacuating the meal eaten\r\nmany days or even a week previously.\r\n\r\nMost hygienists believe that when the colon becomes lined with\r\nhardened fecal matter it is permanently and by the very definition\r\nof the word itself, constipated. This type of constipation is not\r\nperceived as an uncomfortable or overly full feeling or a desire to\r\nhave a bowel movement that won't pass. But it has insidious effects.\r\nUsually constipation delays transit time, increasing the adsorption\r\nof toxins generated from misdigestion of food; by coating and\r\nlocking up significant portions of colon it also reduces the\r\nadsorption of certain minerals and electrolytes.\r\n\r\nSometimes, extremely constipated people have almost constant runny\r\nbowels because the colon has become so thickly and impenetrably\r\nlined with old fecal matter that it no longer removes much moisture.\r\nThis condition is often misinterpreted as diarrhea. The large\r\nintestine's most important task is to transfer water-soluble\r\nminerals from digested food to the blood. When a significant part of\r\nthe colon's surface becomes coated with impermeable dried rigid\r\nfecal matter or mucus it can no longer assimilate effectively and\r\nthe body begins to experience partial mineral starvation in the\r\npresence of plenty. It is my observation from dozens of cases that\r\nwhen the colon has been effectively cleansed the person has a\r\ntendency to gain weight while eating amounts of food that before\r\nonly maintained body weight, while people who could not gain weight\r\nor who were wasting away despite eating heavily begin to gain. And\r\nproblems like soft fingernails, bone loss around teeth or porous\r\nbones tend to improve.\r\n\r\nThe Development Of My Own Constipation\r\n\r\nThe history of my own constipation, though it especially relates to\r\na very rustic childhood, is typical of many people. I was also\r\nraised on a very constipating diet which consisted largely of\r\nprocessed cheese and crackers. Mine was accelerated by shyness,\r\namplified by lack of comfortable facilities.\r\n\r\nI spent my early years on the Canadian prairies, where everybody had\r\nan outhouse. The fancy modern versions are frequently seen on\r\nconstruction sites. These are chemical toilets, quiet different than\r\nthe ones I was raised with because somebody or something\r\nmysteriously comes along, empties them and installs toilet paper.\r\nThe ones I'm familiar with quickly developed a bad-smelling steaming\r\nmound in the center--or it was winter when the outhouse was so cold\r\nthat everything froze almost before it hit the ground in the hole\r\nbelow. (And my rear end seemed to almost freeze to the seat!) The\r\ntoilet paper was usually an out of season issue of Eatons mail order\r\ncatalogue with crisp glossy paper. Perhaps it is a peculiarity of\r\nthe north country, but at night there are always monsters lurking\r\nalong the path to the outhouse, and darkness comes early and stays\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nWhen nature called and it was daylight, and there was no blizzard\r\noutside, the outhouse received a visit from me. If on the other\r\nhand, when it was dark (we had no electricity), and there was a cold\r\nwind creating huge banks of snow, I would 'just skip it,' because\r\nthe alternative--an indoor chamber pot, white enamel with a lid--was\r\nworse. This potty had to be used more or less publicly because the\r\nbedrooms were shared and there was no indoor bathroom. I was always\r\nvery modest about my private parts and private functions, and\r\npotty's were only used in emergencies, and usually with considerable\r\nembarrassment. No one ever explained to me that it was not good for\r\nme to retain fecal matter, and I never thought about it unless my\r\nmovements became so hard that it was painful to eliminate.\r\n\r\nLater in life, I continued this pattern of putting off bowel\r\nmovements, even though outhouses and potties were a thing of the\r\npast. As a young adult I could always think of something more\r\ninteresting to do than sitting on a pot, besides it was messy and\r\nsometimes accompanied by embarrassing sound effects which were\r\ndefinitely not romantic if I was in the company of a young man.\r\nDuring two pregnancies the tendency to constipation was aggravated\r\nby the weight of the fetus resting on an already sluggish bowel, and\r\nthe discomfort of straining to pass my first hard bowel movement\r\nafter childbirth with a torn perineum I won't forget.\r\n\r\nRapid Relief From Colon Cleansing\r\n\r\nDuring fasting the liver is hard at work processing toxins released\r\nfrom fat and other body deposits. The liver still dumps its wastes\r\ninto the intestines through the bile duct. While eating normally,\r\nbile, which contains highly toxic substances, is passed through the\r\nintestines and is eliminated before too much is reabsorbed. (It is\r\nthe bile that usually makes the fecal matter so dark in color.)\r\nHowever, reduction of food bulk reduces or completely eliminates\r\nperistalsis, thus allowing intestinal contents to sit for extended\r\nperiods. And the toxins in the bile are readsorbed, forming a\r\ncontinuous loop, further burdening the liver.\r\n\r\nThe mucus membranes lining the colon constantly secrete lubricants\r\nto ease fecal matter through smoothly. This secretion does not stop\r\nduring fasting; in fact, it may increase because intestinal mucus\r\noften becomes a secondary route of elimination. Allowed to remain in\r\nthe bowel, toxic mucus is an irritant while the toxins in it may be\r\nreabsorbed, forming yet another closed loop and further burdening\r\nthe liver.\r\n\r\nDaily enemas or colonics administered during fasting or while on\r\ncleansing diets effectively remove old fecal material stored in the\r\ncolon and immediately ease the livers load, immediately relieve\r\ndiscomfort by allowing the liver's efforts to further detoxify the\r\nblood, and speed healing. Fasters cleansing on juice or raw food\r\nshould administer two or three enemas in short succession every day\r\nfor the first three days to get a good start on the cleansing\r\nprocess, and then every other day or at very minimum, every few\r\ndays. Enemas or colonics should also be taken whenever symptoms\r\nbecome uncomfortable, regardless of whether you have already cleaned\r\nthe colon that day or not. Once the faster has experienced the\r\nrelief from symptoms that usually comes from an enema they become\r\nmore than willing to repeat this mildly unpleasant experience.\r\n\r\nOccasionally enemas, by filling the colon and making it press on the\r\nliver, induce discharges of highly toxic bile that may cause\r\ntemporary nausea. Despite the induced nausea it is still far better\r\nto continue with colonics because of the great relief experienced\r\nafter the treatment. If nausea exists or persists during colon\r\ncleansing, consider trying slight modifications such as less or no\r\nmassage of the colon in the area of the gall bladder (abdominal area\r\nclose to the bottom of the right rib cage), and putting slightly\r\nless water in the colon when filling it up. It also helps to make\r\nsure that the stomach is empty of any fluid for one hour prior to\r\nthe colonic. Resume drinking after the colonic sessions is\r\ncompleted. If you are one of these rare people who 'toss their\r\nbile', just keep a plastic bucket handy and some water to rinse out\r\nthe mouth after, and carry on as usual.\r\n\r\nEnemas Versus Colonics\r\n\r\nPeople frequently wonder what is the difference between a colonic\r\nand an enema.\r\n\r\nFirst of all enemas are a lot cheaper because you give them to\r\nyourself; an enema bag usually costs about ten dollars, is available\r\nat any large drug store, and is indefinitely reusable. Colonics cost\r\nanywhere from 30 to 75 dollars a session.\r\n\r\nChiropractors and naturopaths who offer this service hire a colonic\r\ntechnician that may or may not be a skilled operator. It is a good\r\nidea to find a person who has a very agreeable and professional\r\nmanner, who can make you feel at ease since relaxation is very\r\nimportant. It is also beneficial to have a colonic therapist who\r\nmassages the abdomen and foot reflexes appropriately during the\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nEnemas and colonics can accomplish exactly the same beneficial work.\r\nBut colonics accomplish more improvement in less time than enemas\r\nfor several reasons. During a colonic from 30 to 50 gallons of water\r\nare flushed through the large intestines, usually in a repetitive\r\nseries of fill-ups followed by flushing with a continuous flow of\r\nwater. This efficiency cannot even be approached with an enema. But\r\nby repeating the enema three times in close succession a\r\nsatisfactory cleanse can be achieved. Persisted with long enough,\r\nenemas will clean the colon every bit as well as a colonic machine\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nEnemas given at home take a lot less time than traveling to receive\r\na colonics at someone's clinic, and can be done entirely at you own\r\nconvenience--a great advantage when fasting because you can save\r\nyour energy for internal healing. But colonics are more appropriate\r\nfor some. There are fasters who are unable to give themselves an\r\nenema either because their arms are too short and their body is too\r\nlong and they lack flexibility, or because of a physical handicap or\r\nthey can't confront their colon, so they let someone else do it.\r\nSome don't have the motivation to give themselves a little\r\ndiscomfort but are comfortable with someone else doing it to them.\r\nSome very sick people are too weak to cleanse their own colon, so\r\nthey should find someone to assist them with an at-home enema or\r\nhave someone take them to a colonic therapist.\r\n\r\nFew people these days have any idea how to properly give themselves\r\nan enema. The practice has been discredited by traditional medical\r\ndoctors as slightly dangerous, perhaps addictive and a sign of\r\npsychological weirdness. Yet Northamericans on their civilized, low\r\nfiber, poorly combined diets suffer widely from constipation. One\r\nproof of this is the fact that chemical laxatives, with their own\r\nset of dangers and liabilities, occupy many feet of drug store shelf\r\nspace and are widely advertised. Is the medical profession's\r\ndisapproval of the enema related to the fact that once the initial\r\npurchase of an enema bag has been made there are no further expenses\r\nfor laxatives? Or perhaps it might be that once a person discovers\r\nthey can cure a headache, stop a cold dead in its tracks with an\r\nenema, they aren't visiting the M.D.s so often.\r\n\r\nThe enema has also been wrongly accused of causing a gradual loss of\r\ncolon muscle tone, eventually preventing bowel movements without the\r\nstimulation of an enema, leading finally to flaccidity and\r\nenlargement of the lower bowel. This actually can happen; when it\r\ndoes occur it is the result of frequent administration of small\r\namounts of water (fleet enemas) for the purpose of stimulating a\r\nnormal bowel movement. The result is constant stretching of the\r\nrectum without sufficient fluid to enter the descending colon. A\r\ncompletely opposite, highly positive effect comes from properly\r\nadministered enemas while cleansing.\r\n\r\nThe difference between helpful and potentially harmful enemas lies\r\nin the amount of water injected and the frequency of use. Using a\r\ncup or two of water to induce a bowel movement may eventually cause\r\ndependency, will not strengthen the colon and may after years of\r\nthis practice, result in distention and enlargement of the rectum or\r\nsigmoid colon. However, a completely empty average-sized colon has\r\nthe capacity of about a gallon of water. When increasingly larger\r\nenemas are administered until the colon is nearly emptied of fecal\r\nmatter and the injection of close to a gallon of water is achieved,\r\nbeneficial exercise and an increase in overall muscle tone are the\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nCorrectly given, enemas (and especially colonics) serve as\r\nstrengthening exercises for the colon. This long tubular muscle is\r\nrepeatedly and completely filled with water, inducing it to\r\nvigorously exercise while evacuating itself multiple times. The\r\nresult is a great increase in muscle tone, acceleration of\r\nperistalsis and eventually, after several dozens of repetitions, a\r\nconsiderable reduction of transit time. Well-done enemas work the\r\ncolon somewhat less effectively and do not improve muscle tone quite\r\nas much as colonics.\r\n\r\nInjecting an entire gallon of water with an enema bag is very\r\nimpractical when a person is eating normally. But on a light\r\ncleansing diet or while fasting the amount of new material passing\r\ninto the colon is small or negligible. During the first few days of\r\nfasting if two or three enemas are administered each day in\r\nimmediate succession the colon is soon completely emptied of\r\nrecently eaten food and it becomes progressively easier to introduce\r\nlarger amounts of water. Within a few days of this regimen,\r\ninjecting half a gallon or more of water is easy and painless.\r\n\r\nProbably for psychological reasons, some peoples' colons allow water\r\nto be injected one time but then \"freeze up\" and resist successive\r\nenemas. For this reason better results are often obtained by having\r\none enema, waiting a half hour, another enema, wait a half hour, and\r\nhave a final enema.\r\n\r\nA colonic machine in the hands of an expert operator can administer\r\nthe equivalent of six or seven big enemas in less than one hour, and\r\ndo this without undue discomfort or effort from the person receiving\r\nthe colonic. However, the AMA has suppressed the use of colonics;\r\nthey are illegal to administer in many states. Where colonics are\r\nlegal, the chiropractors now consider this practice messy and not\r\nvery profitable compared to manipulations. So it is not easy to find\r\na skilled and willing colonic technician.\r\n\r\nAnyone who plans to give themselves therapeutic enemas while fasting\r\nwould be well advised to first seek out a colonic therapist and\r\nreceive two or three colonics delivered one day apart while eating\r\nlightly and then immediately begin the fast. Three colonics given on\r\nthree successive days of a light, raw food diet are sufficient to\r\nempty all recently eaten food even from a very constipated,\r\ndistended and bloated colon, while acquainting a person with their\r\nown bowel. Having an empty colon is actually a pleasant and to most\r\npeople a thoroughly novel experience. A few well-delivered colonics\r\ncan quickly accustom a person to the sensations accompanying the\r\nenema and demonstrate the effect to be achieved by oneself with an\r\nenema bag, something not quickly discoverable any other way.\r\n\r\nHow To Give Yourself An Enema\r\n\r\nEnemas have been medically out of favor for a long time. Most people\r\nhave never had one. So here are simple directions to self-administer\r\nan effective enema series.\r\n\r\nThe enema bag you select is important. It must hold at least two\r\nquarts and be rapidly refillable. The best American-made brand is\r\nmade of rubber with about five feet of rubber hose ending in one of\r\ntwo different white hard plastic insertion tips. The bag is designed\r\nfor either enemas or vaginal douches. It hangs from a detachable\r\nplastic \"S\" hook. When filled to the brim it holds exactly one-half\r\ngallon. The maker of this bag offers another model that costs about\r\na dollar more and also functions as a hot water bottle. A good\r\ncomforter it may make, but the dual purpose construction makes the\r\nbag very awkward to rapidly refill. I recommend the inexpensive\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\nThe plastic insertion tips vary somewhat. The straight tubular tip\r\nis intended for enemas; the flared vaginal douche tip can be useful\r\nfor enemas too, in that it somewhat restrains unintentional\r\nexpulsion of the nozzle while filling the colon. However, its four\r\nsmall holes do not allow a very rapid rate of flow.\r\n\r\nTo give yourself an enema, completely fill the bag with tepid water\r\nthat does not exceed body temperature. The rectum is surprisingly\r\nsensitive to heat and you will flinch at temperatures only a degree\r\nor two higher than 98 Fahrenheit. Cooler water is no problem; some\r\nfind the cold stimulating and invigorating. Fasters having\r\ndifficulty staying warm should be wary of cold water enemas. These\r\ncan drop core body temperature below the point of comfort.\r\n\r\nMake sure the flow clamp on the tube is tightly shut and located a\r\nfew inches up the tube from the nozzle. Hang the filled bag from a\r\nclothes or towel hook, shower nozzle, curtain rod, or other\r\nconvenient spot about four to five feet above the bathroom floor or\r\ntub bottom. The higher the bag the greater the water pressure and\r\nspeed of filling. But too much pressure can also be uncomfortable.\r\nYou may have to experiment a bit with this.\r\n\r\nVarious body positions are possible for filling the colon. None is\r\ncorrect or necessarily more effective than another. Experiment and\r\nfind the one you prefer. Some fill their colon kneeling and bending\r\nforward in the bathtub or shower because there will likely be small\r\ndribbles of water leaking from around the nozzle. Usually these\r\nleaks do not contain fecal matter. Others prefer to use the bathroom\r\nfloor. For the bony, a little padding in the form of a folded towel\r\nunder knees and elbows may make the process more comfortable. You\r\nmay kneel and bend over while placing your elbows or hands on the\r\nfloor, reach behind yourself and insert the nozzle. You may also lie\r\non your back or on your side. Some think the left side is preferable\r\nbecause the colon attaches to the rectum on the left side of the\r\nbody, ascends up the left side of the abdomen to a line almost as\r\nhigh as the solar plexus, then transverses the body to the right\r\nside where it descends again on the right almost to the groin. The\r\nsmall intestine attaches to the colon near its lower-right\r\nextremity. In fact these are the correct names given for the parts\r\nof the colon: Ascending, Descending and Transverse Colon along with\r\nthe Sigmoid Colon or Rectum at the exit end.\r\n\r\nAs you become more expert at filling your colon with water you will\r\nbegin to become aware of its location by the weight, pressure and\r\nsometimes temperature of the water you're injecting. You will come\r\nto know how much of the colon has been filled by feel. You will also\r\nbecome aware of peristalsis as the water is evacuated vigorously and\r\ndiscover that sensations from a colon hard at work, though a bit\r\nuncomfortable, are not necessarily pain.\r\n\r\nInsertion of the nozzle is sometimes eased with a little lubricant.\r\nA bit of soap or KY jelly is commonly used. If the nozzle can be\r\ninserted without lubricant it will have less tendency to slip out.\r\nHowever, do not tear or damage the anus by avoiding necessary\r\nlubrication. After insertion, grip the clamp with one hand and open\r\nit. The flow rate can be controlled with this clamp. Keeping a hand\r\non the clamp also prevents the nozzle from being expelled.\r\n\r\nWater will begin flowing into the colon. Your goal is to empty the\r\nentire bag into the colon before sensations of pressure or urgency\r\nto evacuate the water force you to remove the nozzle and head for\r\nthe toilet. Relaxation of mind and body helps achieve this. You are\r\nvery unlikely to achieve a half-gallon fill up on the first attempt.\r\nIf painful pressure is experienced try closing the clamp for a\r\nmoment to allow the water to begin working its way around the\r\nobstacle. Or, next time try hanging the bag lower, reducing its\r\nheight above the body and thus lowering the water pressure. Or, try\r\nopening the clamp only partially. Or, try panting hard, so as to\r\nmake the abdomen move rapidly in and out, sort of shaking the colon.\r\nThis last technique is particularly good to get the water past a\r\nblockage of intestinal gas.\r\n\r\nIt is especially important for Americans, whose culture does not\r\nteach one to be tolerant of discomfort, to keep in mind that pain is\r\nthe body's warning that actual damage is being done to tissues.\r\nEnemas can do no damage and pose no risk except to that rare\r\nindividual with weak spots in the colon's wall from cancers. When an\r\nenema is momentarily perceived unpleasantly, the correct name for\r\nthe experience is a sensation, not pain. You may have to work at\r\nincreasing your tolerance for unpleasant sensations or it will take\r\nyou a long time to achieve the goal of totally filling the colon\r\nwith water. Be brave! And relax. A wise philosopher once said that\r\nit is a rough Universe in which only the tigers survive--and\r\nsometimes they have a hard time.\r\n\r\nEventually it will be time to remove the nozzle and evacuate the\r\nwater. Either a blockage (usually fecal matter, an air bubble, or a\r\ntight 'U' turn in the colon, usually at either the splenetic, or\r\nhepatic flexures located right below the rib cage) will prevent\r\nfurther inflow (undesirable) or else the bag will completely empty\r\n(good!) or the sensation of bursting will no longer be tolerable. Go\r\nsit on the toilet and wait until all the water has passed. Then\r\nrefill the bag and repeat the process. Each time you fill the colon\r\nit will allow more water to enter more easily with less\r\nunpleasantness. Fasters and cleansers should make at least three\r\nattempts at a complete fill-up each time they do an enema session.\r\n\r\nWater and juice fasters will find that after the first few enemas,\r\nit will become very easy to inject the entire half-gallon of water.\r\nThat is because there is little or no chime entering the colon.\r\nAfter a few days the entire colon will seem (this is incorrect) to\r\nbe empty except when it is filled with water. This is the point to\r\nlearn an advanced self-administered enema technique. An average\r\ncolon empty of new food will usually hold about one gallon of water.\r\nThat is average. A small colon might only hold 3/4 gallon, a large\r\none might accept a gallon and a half, or even more. You'll need to\r\nlearn to simultaneously refill the bag while injecting water, so as\r\nto achieve a complete irrigation of the whole colon. There are\r\nseveral possible methods. You might try placing a pitcher or\r\nhalf-gallon mason jar of tepid water next to the bag and after the\r\nbag has emptied the first time, stand up while holding the tube in\r\nthe anus, refill the bag and then lie down again and continue\r\nfilling. You might have an assistant do this for you. You might try\r\nhanging the bag from the shower head and direct a slow, continuous\r\ndribble of lukewarm water from the shower into the bag while you\r\nkneel or lie relaxed in the tub. This way the bag will never empty\r\nand you stop filling only when you feel fullness and pressure all\r\nthe way back to the beginning of the ascending colon. Of course,\r\nhanging from a slowly running shower head the bag will probably\r\noverflow and you will get splashed and so will the bathroom floor\r\nwhen your wet body moves rapidly from the tub to the toilet. I've\r\nimagined making an enema bag from a two gallon plastic bucket with a\r\nsmall plastic hose barb glued into a hole drilled in the bottom or\r\nlower edge. If I were in the business of manufacturing enema bags\r\nI'd make them hold at least one gallon.\r\n\r\nA word of caution to those folks who have a pattern of overdoing it,\r\nor tend to think that more is better. This is not true when it comes\r\nto colon cleansing. Do not make more than three attempts to fill and\r\nclean the colon with an enema bag. Usually the colon begins to\r\nprotest and won't accept any more fill-ups. When having colonics on\r\na colonic machine it is a good idea to continue until the water\r\ncomes back reasonably clear for that session. It is not a good idea\r\nfor a faster to have colonics that last more than three-quarters of\r\nan hour to an hour maximum, or it will be too tiring. Even\r\nnon-fasters find colonics tiring. After all, the colon is basically\r\na big muscle that has become very lazy on a low-fiber diet.\r\n\r\nI've personally administered over five thousand colonics, taught\r\nseveral dozen fasters to self-administer their own and stood by\r\nwhile they gave themselves one until they were quite expert. In all\r\nthat experience I've only seen one person have a seriously bad\r\nresult. This was a suicidally depressed water faster that I\r\n(mistakenly) allowed to administer their own colonics with my\r\nmachine. This person not only took daily colonics, but allowed water\r\nto flow through their colon for as long as two hours at a time.\r\nPerhaps they were trying to wash out their mind? After several weeks\r\nof this extreme excess, the faster became highly confused and\r\ndisoriented due to a severe electrolyte imbalance. They had to be\r\ntaken off water fasting immediately and recovered their mental\r\nclarity in a few days. The loss of blood electrolytes happened\r\nbecause during colonics there occurs a sort of low-grade very slow\r\nreverse osmosis.\r\n\r\nCuring With Enemas\r\n\r\nIt is not wise to continue regular colonics or enemas once a\r\ndetoxification program has been completed and you have returned to a\r\nmaintenance diet. The body should be allowed its regular\r\nfunctioning.\r\n\r\nBut because enemas immediately lower the toxic load on the liver, I\r\ndo recommend people use them for prevention of an acute illness (you\r\nfeel like you are coming down with something), and for the treatment\r\nof acute illnesses such as a cold. I also like to take one if I have\r\nbeen away traveling for extended periods, eating carelessly. But do\r\nnot fall into a pattern of bingeing on bad food, and then trying to\r\nget rid of it through colonics or laxative. This is bulimia, the\r\neating disorder discussed earlier.\r\n\r\nThe Sheltonite capital \"N\" Natural capital \"H\" Hygienists do not\r\nrecommend any colon cleansing, ever! They think that the colon will\r\nspontaneously cleanse itself on a long water fast, but my experience\r\nlearned from monitoring hundreds of fasters is that it doesn't\r\nreally. Herbert Shelton also considered colon cleansing enervating\r\nand therefore undesirable. Colon cleansing does use the faster's\r\nenergy but on the balance, colon cleansing saves more work on the\r\npart of an overburdened liver than it uses up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Five\r\n\r\nDiet and Nutrition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom The Hygienic Dictionary\r\n\r\nFood. [1] Life is a tragedy of nutrition. In food lies 99.99% of the\r\ncauses of all diseases and imperfect health of any kind. _Prof.\r\nArnold Ehret, Mucusless Diet Healing System._ [2] But elimination\r\nwill never heal perfectly just so long as you fail to discontinue\r\nthe supply of inside waste caused by eating and \"wrong\" eating. You\r\nmay clean and continue to clean indefinitely, but never with\r\ncomplete results up to a perfect cleanliness, as long as the intake\r\nof wrong or even too much right foods, is not stopped._ Prof. Arnold\r\nEhret, Mucusless Diet Healing System._ [3] Cooked food favors\r\nbacterial, or organized, ferment preponderance, because cooking\r\nkills the unorganized and organized ferments, and both are needed to\r\ncarry on the body's digestion. Raw foods--fruits and vegetables--favor\r\nunorganized ferment digestion, because these foods carry vitamins,\r\nwhich are unorganized ferments--enzymes. _Dr. John. H. Tilden,\r\nImpaired Health: Its Cause and Cure, 1921._\r\n\r\nRecently, my younger (adult) daughter asked my advice choosing\r\nbetween a root canal or having a bridge made. This led to a\r\ndiscussion of her eating habits in general. Defending her currently\r\nless-than-optimum diet against my gentle criticism, she threw me a\r\ntough riposte. \"Why,\" she asked, when I was raised so perfectly as a\r\nchild, \"when I ate only Organic food until I was ten and old enough\r\nto make you send me to public school where I could eat those lousy\r\nschool lunches\" (her unfeeling, heartless mother home-schooled her),\r\n\"why even at that young age, (before she spent her adolescent\r\nrebellion eating junk food) why at that point did I still have a\r\nmouthful of cavities?\" And she did. At age ten my daughter needed\r\nabout ten fillings.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful daughter of a practicing naturopath had received\r\nwhat, at the time, I considered virtually perfect nutrition. She\r\nsuckled hugely at her mother's abundant breast until age two. During\r\nthis time her mother ate a natural foods diet. After weaning my\r\ndaughter got only whole grains, a little fresh goat's milk from my\r\ngoat, fruits and lots of Organic vegetables. I started my spa when\r\nmy daughter was about five years old and from that point she was,\r\nlike it or not, a raw fooder. And all that raw food was Organic and\r\nmuch of it from Great Oaks School's huge vegetable garden.\r\n\r\nFor my daughter to develop cavities on this diet is reminiscent of\r\nWoody Allen's joke in his movie \"Sleeper.\" Do you recall this one,\r\nmade about 1973? The plot is a take off on Rip Van Winkle. Woody\r\ngoes into the hospital for minor surgery. Unexpectedly he expires on\r\nthe operating table and his body is frozen in hopes that someday he\r\ncan be revived. One hundred and fifty years later he is revived.\r\n\r\nThe priceless scene I always think of takes place in his hospital\r\nroom immediately after he comes to consciousness. The doctor in\r\ncharge of his case is explaining to Woody what has happened. Woody\r\nrefuses to believe he died and was frozen, asserting that the whole\r\nstory is a put on. Woody insists that the 'doctor' is clearly an\r\nactor hired by his friends! It absolutely can't be the year 2123.\r\n'Oh, but it really is 2123,' insists the doctor. 'And it is no put\r\non by his friends; all his friends are long dead; Woody knows no one\r\nat all in 2123 and had better prepare himself to start a new life.'\r\n\r\nWoody still insists it is a put on. \"I had a healthfood store,\" he\r\nsays, \"and all my friends ate brown rice. They can't be dead!\"\r\n\r\nAnd my perfectly nourished daughter couldn't have developed\r\ncavities! But she did. And if she cheated on her perfect diet, bad\r\nfood could not have amounted to more than two percent of her total\r\ncaloric intake from birth to age ten. I was a responsible mom and I\r\nmade sure she ate right! Now my daughter was demanding to know why\r\nshe had tooth decay. Fortunately, I now know the answer. The answer\r\nis rather complex, but I can give a simplified explanation.\r\n\r\nThe Confusions About Diets and Foods\r\n\r\nLike my daughter, many people of all ages are muddled about the\r\nrelationship between health and diet. Their confusions have created\r\na profitable market for health-related information. And equally,\r\ntheir confusions have been created by books, magazine articles, and\r\nTV news features. This avalanche of data is highly contradictory. In\r\nfact, one reason I found it hard to make myself write my own book is\r\nthat I wondered if my book too would become just another part of the\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nFew people are willing to tolerate very much uncertainty. Rather\r\nthan live with the discomfort of not knowing why, they will create\r\nan explanation or find some answer, any answer, and then ever after,\r\nassert its rightness like a shipwrecked person clings to a floating\r\nspar in a storm. This is how I explain the genesis of many\r\ncontemporary food religions.\r\n\r\nAppropriately new agey and spiritual, Macrobiotics teaches the way\r\nto perfect health is to eat like a Japanese whole foods\r\nvegetarian--the endless staple being brown rice, some cooked\r\nvegetables and seaweeds, meanwhile balancing the \"yin\" and \"yang\" of\r\nthe foods. And Macrobiotics works great for a lot of people. But not\r\nall people. Because there's next to nothing raw in the Macrobiotic\r\ndiet and some people are allergic to rice, or can get allergic to\r\nrice on that diet.\r\n\r\nLinda Clark's Diet for a Small Planet also has hundreds of thousands\r\nof dedicated followers. This system balances the proportions of\r\nessential amino acids at every, single meal and is vegetarian. This\r\ndiet also works and really helps some people, but not as well as\r\nMacrobiotics in my opinion because obsessed with protein, Clark's\r\ndiet contains too many hard-to-digest soy products and makes poor\r\nfood combinations from the point of digestive capacity.\r\n\r\nThen there are the raw fooders. Most of them are raw, Organic\r\nfooders who go so far as to eat only unfired, unground cereals that\r\nhave been soaked in warm water (at less than 115 degrees or you'll\r\nkill the enzymes) for many hours to soften the seeds up and start\r\nthem sprouting. This diet works and really helps a lot of people.\r\nRaw organic foodism is especially good for \"holy joes,\" a sort of\r\nbetter-than-everyone-else person who enjoys great self-righteousness\r\nby owning this system. But raw fooding does not help all people nor\r\nsolve all diseases because raw food irritates the digestive tracts\r\nof some people and in northern climates it is hard to maintain body\r\nheat on this diet because it is difficult to consume enough\r\nconcentrated vegetable food in a raw state. And some raw fooders eat\r\nfar too much fruit. I've seen them lose their teeth because of\r\nfruit's low mineral content, high sugar level and constant fruit\r\nacids in their mouths.\r\n\r\nThen there are vegetarians of various varieties including vegans\r\n(vegetarians that will not eat dairy products and eggs), and then,\r\nthere are their exact opposites, Atkins dieters focusing on protein\r\nand eating lots of meat. There's the Adelle Davis school, people\r\neating whole grains, handfuls of vitamins, lots of dairy and brewers\r\nyeast and wheat germ, and even raw liver. Then there's the Organic\r\nschool. These folks will eat anything in any combination, just so\r\nlong as it is organically produced, including organically raised\r\nbeef, chicken, lamb, eggs, rabbit, wild meats, milk and diary\r\nproducts, natural sea salt in large quantities and of course,\r\norganically grown fruits, vegetables grains and nuts. And what is\r\n\"Organic?\" The word means food raised in compliance with a set of\r\nrules contrived by a certification bureaucracy. When carefully\r\nanalyzed, the somewhat illogical rules are not all that different in\r\nspirit than the rules of kashsruth or kosher. And the Organic\r\ncertification bureaucrats aren't all that different than the rabbis\r\nwho certify food as being kosher, either.\r\n\r\nThere are now millions of frightened Americans who, following the\r\nadvice of mainstream Authority, have eliminated red meat from their\r\ndiets and greatly reduced what they (mistakenly) understand as\r\nhigh-cholesterol foods.\r\n\r\nAll these diets work too--or some--and all demonstrate some of the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe only area concerning health that contains more confusion and\r\ncontradictory data than diet is vitamins. What a rats nest that is!\r\n\r\nThe Fundamental Principle\r\n\r\nIf you are a true believer in any of the above food religions, I\r\nexpect that you will find my views unsettling. But what I consider\r\n\"good diet\" results from my clinical work with thousands of cases.\r\nIt is what has worked with those cases. My eclectic views\r\nincorporate bits and pieces of all the above. In my own case, I\r\nstarted out by following the Organic school, and I was once a raw\r\nfood vegetarian who ate nothing but raw food for six years. I also\r\nate Macrobiotic for about one year until I became violently allergic\r\nto rice.\r\n\r\nI have arrived at a point where I understand that each person's\r\nbiochemistry is unique and each must work out their own diet to suit\r\ntheir life goals, life style, genetic predisposition and current\r\nstate of health. There is no single, one, all-encompassing, correct\r\ndiet. But, there is a single, basic, underlying Principle of\r\nNutrition that is universally true. In its most simplified form, the\r\nbasic equation of human health goes: Health = Nutrition / Calories.\r\nThe equation falls far short of explaining the origin of each\r\nindividuals diseases or how to cure diseases but Health = Nutrition\r\n/ Calories does show the general path toward healthful eating and\r\nproper medicine.\r\n\r\nAll animals have the exact same dietary problem: finding enough\r\nnutrition to build and maintain their bodies within the limits of\r\ntheir digestive capacity. Rarely in nature (except for predatory\r\ncarnivores) is there any significant restriction on the number of\r\ncalories or serious limitation of the amount of low-nutrition foods\r\navailable to eat. There's rarely any shortage of natural junk food\r\non Earth. Except for domesticated house pets, animals are sensible\r\nenough to prefer the most nutritional fare available and tend to\r\nshun empty calories unless they are starving.\r\n\r\nBut humans are perverse, not sensible. Deciding on the basis of\r\nartificially-created flavors, preferring incipid textures, we seem\r\nto prefer junk food and become slaves to our food addictions. For\r\nexample, in tropical countries there is a widely grown root crop,\r\ncalled in various places: tapioca, tavioca, manioc, or yuca. This\r\ninteresting plant produces the greatest tonnage of edible,\r\ndigestible, pleasant-tasting calories per acre compared to any other\r\nfood crop I know. Manioc might seem the answer to human starvation\r\nbecause it will grow abundantly on tropical soils so infertile\r\nand/or so droughty that no other food crop will succeed there.\r\nManioc will do this because it needs virtually nothing from the soil\r\nto construct itself with. And consequently, manioc puts next to\r\nnothing nourishing into its edible parts. The bland-tasting root is\r\nvirtually pure starch, a simple carbohydrate not much different than\r\npure corn starch. Plants construct starches from carbon dioxide gas\r\nobtained the air and hydrogen obtained from water. There is no\r\nshortage ever of carbon from CO2 in the air and rarely a shortage of\r\nhydrogen from water. When the highly digestible starch in manioc is\r\nchewed, digestive enzymes readily convert it into sugar.\r\nNutritionally there is virtually no difference between eating manioc\r\nand eating white sugar. Both are entirely empty calories.\r\n\r\nIf you made a scale from ideal to worst regarding the ratio of\r\nnutrition to calories, white sugar, manioc and most fats are at the\r\nextreme undesirable end. Frankly I don't know which single food\r\nmight lie at the extreme positive end of the scale. Close to perfect\r\nmight be certain leafy green vegetables that can be eaten raw. When\r\nthey are grown on extremely fertile soil, some greens develop 20 or\r\nmore percent completely digestible balanced protein with ideal\r\nratios of all the essential amino acids, lots of vitamins, tons of\r\nminerals, all sorts of enzymes and other nutritional elements--and\r\nvery few calories. You could continually fill your stomach to\r\nbursting with raw leafy greens and still have a hard time sustaining\r\nyour body weight if that was all you ate. Maybe Popeye the Sailorman\r\nwas right about eating spinach.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, lets ignore individual genetic inabilities to digest\r\nspecific foods and also ignore the effects stress and enervation can\r\nhave on our ability to extract nutrition out of the food we are\r\neating. Without those factors to consider, it is correct to say\r\nthat, to the extent one's diet contains the maximum potential amount\r\nof nutrition relative to the number of calories you are eating, to\r\nthat extent a person will be healthy. To the extent the diet is\r\ndegraded from that ideal, to that extent, disease will develop.\r\nThink about it!\r\n\r\nLessons From Nutritional Anthropology\r\n\r\nThe next logical pair of questions are: how healthy could good\r\nnutrition make people be, and, how much deviation from ideal\r\nnutrition could we allow ourselves before serious disease appears?\r\nLuckily, earlier in this century we could observe living answers to\r\nthose questions (before the evidence disappeared). The answers are:\r\nwe could be amazingly healthy, and, if we wish to enjoy excellent\r\nhealth we can afford to cut ourselves surprisingly little slack.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Second World War there were several dozen sizable\r\ngroups of extraordinarily healthy humans remaining on Earth. Today,\r\ntheir descendants are still in the same remote places, are speaking\r\nthe same languages and possess more or less the same cultures. Only\r\ntoday they're watching satellite TV. wearing jeans, drinking\r\ncolas--and their superior health has evaporated.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of this century, at the same era vitamins and\r\nother basic aspects of nutrition were being discovered, a few\r\nfarsighted medical explorers sought out these hard-to-reach places\r\nwith their legendarily healthy peoples to see what caused the\r\nlegendary well-being they'd heard of. Enough evidence was collected\r\nand analyzed to derive some very valid principles.\r\n\r\nFirst lets dismiss some apparently logical but incorrect\r\nexplanations for the unusually good health of these isolated\r\npeoples. It wasn't racial, genetic superiority. There were\r\nextraordinarily healthy blacks, browns, Orientals, Amerinds,\r\nCaucasians. It wasn't living at high altitude; some lived at sea\r\nlevel. It wasn't temperate climates, some lived in the tropics, some\r\nin the tropics at sea level, a type of location generally thought to\r\nbe quite unhealthful. It wasn't a small collection of genetically\r\nsuperior individuals, because when these peoples left their isolated\r\nlocale and moved to the city, they rapidly began to lose their\r\nhealth. And it wasn't genetics because when a young couple from the\r\nisolated healthy village moved to town, their children born in town\r\nwere as unhealthy as all the other kids.\r\n\r\nAnd what do I mean by genuinely healthy? Well, imagine a remote\r\nvillage or a mountain valley or a far island settlement very\r\ndifficult to get to, where there lived a thousand or perhaps ten\r\nthousand people. Rarely fewer, rarely more. Among that small\r\npopulation there were no medical doctors and no dentists, no drugs,\r\nno vaccinations, no antibiotics. Usually the isolation carried with\r\nit illiteracy and precluded contact with or awareness of modern\r\nscience, so there was little or no notion of public hygiene. And\r\nthis was before the era of antibiotics. Yet these unprotected,\r\nundoctored, unvaccinated peoples did not suffer and die from\r\nbacterial infections; and the women did not have to give birth to 13\r\nchildren to get 2.4 to survive to breeding age--almost all the\r\nchildren made it through the gauntlet of childhood diseases. There\r\nwas also virtually no degenerative disease like heart attacks,\r\nhardening of the arteries, senility, cancer, arthritis. There were\r\nfew if any birth defects. In fact, there probably weren't any\r\naspirin in the entire place. Oh, and there was very little mortality\r\nduring childbirth, as little or less than we have today with all our\r\nhospitals. And the people uniformly had virtually perfect teeth and\r\nkept them all till death, but did not have toothbrushes nor any\r\nnotion of dental hygiene. Nor did they have dentists or physicians.\r\n(Price, 1970)\r\n\r\nAnd in those fortunate places the most common causes of death were\r\naccident (trauma) and old age. The typical life span was long into\r\nthe 70s and in some places quite a bit longer. One fabled place,\r\nHunza, was renowned for having an extraordinarily high percentage of\r\nvigorous and active people over 100 years old.\r\n\r\nI hope I've made you curious. \"How could this be?\" you're asking.\r\nWell, here's why. First, everyone of those groups lived in places so\r\nentirely remote, so inaccessible that they were of necessity,\r\nvirtually self-sufficient. They hardly traded at all with the\r\noutside world, and certainly they did not trade for bulky,\r\nhard-to-transport bulk foodstuffs. Virtually everything they ate was\r\nproduced by themselves. If they were an agricultural people,\r\nnaturally, everything they ate was natural: organic, whole,\r\nunsprayed and fertilized with what ever local materials seemed to\r\nproduce enhanced plant growth. And, if they were agricultural, they\r\nlived on a soil body that possessed highly superior natural\r\nfertility. If not an agricultural people they lived by the sea and\r\nmade a large portion of their diets sea foods. If their soil had not\r\nbeen extraordinarily fertile, these groups would not have enjoyed\r\nsuperior health and would have conformed to the currently\r\nwidely-believed notion that before the modern era, people's lives\r\nwere brutish, unhealthful, and short.\r\n\r\nWhat is common between meat-eating Eskimos, isolated highland Swiss\r\nliving on rye bread, milk and cheese; isolated Scottish island Celts\r\nwith a dietary of oat porridge, kale and sea foods; highland central\r\nAfricans (Malawi) eating sorghum, millet tropical root crops and all\r\nsorts of garden vegetables, plus a little meat and dairy; Fijians\r\nliving on small islands in the humid tropics at sea level eating sea\r\nfoods and garden vegetables. What they had in common was that their\r\nfoods were all were at the extreme positive end of the Health =\r\nNutrition / Calories scale. The agriculturists were on very fertile\r\nsoil that grew extraordinarily nutrient-rich food, the sea food\r\ngatherers were obtaining their tucker from the place where all the\r\nfertility that ever was in the soil had washed out of the land had\r\nbeen transported--sea foods are also extraordinarily nutrient rich.\r\n\r\nThe group with the very best soil and consequently, the best health\r\nof all were, by lucky accident, the Hunza. I say \"lucky\" and\r\n\"accident\" because the Hunza and their resource base unknowingly\r\ndeveloped an agricultural system that produced the most nutritious\r\nfood that is possible to grow. The Hunza lived on what has been\r\ncalled super food. There are a lot of interesting books about the\r\nHunza, some deserving of careful study. (Wrench, 1938; Rodale, 1949)\r\n\r\nFinding Your Ideal Dietary\r\n\r\nAnyone that is genuinely interested in having the best possible\r\nhealth should make their own study of the titles listed in the\r\nbibliography in the back of this book. After you do, award yourself\r\na BS nutrition. I draw certain conclusions from this body of data. I\r\nthink they help a person sort out the massive confusion that exists\r\ntoday about proper diet.\r\n\r\nFirst principle: Homo Sapiens clearly can posses extreme health\r\nwhile eating very different dietary regimens. There is no one right\r\ndiet for humans.\r\n\r\nBefore the industrial era almost everyone on Earth ate what was\r\nproduced locally. Their dietary choices were pretty much restricted\r\nto those foods that were well adapted and productive in their\r\nregion. Some places grew rye, others wheat, others millet, others\r\nrice. Some places supported cows, others goats, others had few on no\r\ndomesticated animals. Some places produced a lot of fruits and\r\nvegetables. Others, did not. Whatever the local dietary, during\r\nthousands of years of eating that dietary natural selection\r\nprevailed; most babies that were allergic to or not able to thrive\r\non the available dietary, died quickly. Probably of childhood\r\nbacterial infections. The result of this weeding out process was a\r\npopulation closely adapted to the available dietary of a particular\r\nlocale.\r\n\r\nThis has interesting implications for Americans, most of whose\r\nancestors immigrated from somewhere else; many of our ancestors also\r\n\"hybridized\" or crossed with immigrants from elsewhere. Trying to\r\ndiscover what dietary substances your particular genetic endowment\r\nis adapted to can be difficult and confusing. If both your parents\r\nwere Italian and they were more or less pure Italian going way back,\r\nyou might start out trying to eat wheat, olives, garlic, fava beans,\r\ngrapes, figs, cow dairy. If pure German, try rye bread, cow dairy,\r\napples, cabbage family vegetables. If Scottish, try oats, mutton,\r\nfish, sheep dairy and cabbage family vegetables. If Jewish, try goat\r\ndairy, wheat, olives and citrus. And certainly all the above ethnic\r\nderivations will thrive on many kinds of vegetables. Afro-Americans,\r\nespecially dark-complexioned ones little mixed with Europeans, might\r\ndo well to avoid wheat and instead, try sorghum, millet or tropical\r\nroot crops like sweet potatoes, yams and taro.\r\n\r\nMaking it even more difficult for an individual to discover their\r\noptimum diet is the existence of genetic-based allergies and worse,\r\ndeveloped allergies. Later in this chapter I will explain how a body\r\ncan develop an allergy to a food that is probably irreversible. A\r\nweakened organ can also prevent digestion of a food or food group.\r\n\r\nOne more thing about adaptation to dietaries. Pre-industrial humans\r\ncould only be extraordinarily healthy on the dietary they were\r\nadapted to if and only if that dietary also was extraordinarily high\r\nin nutrients. Few places on earth have naturally rich soil. Food\r\ngrown on poor soil is poor in nutrition; that grown on rich soil is\r\nhigh in nutrition. People do not realize that the charts and tables\r\nin the backs of health books like Adelle Davis's Lets Cook It Right,\r\nare not really true. They are statistics. It is vital to keep in\r\nmind the old saying, \"there are lies, there are damned lies, and\r\nthen there are statistics. The best way to lie is with statistics.\"\r\n\r\nStatistical tables of the nutrient content of foods were developed\r\nby averaging numerous samples of food from various soils and\r\nregions. These tables basically lie because they do not show the\r\nrange of possibility between the different samples. A chart may\r\nstate authoritatively that 100 grams of broccoli contains so many\r\nmilligrams of calcium. What it does not say is that some broccoli\r\nsamples contain only half that amount or even less, while other\r\nbroccoli contains two or three times that amount. Since calcium is a\r\nvital nutrient hard to come by in digestible form, the high calcium\r\nbroccoli is far better food than the low calcium sample. But both\r\nsamples of broccoli appear and taste more or less alike. Both could\r\neven be organically grown. Yet one sample has a very positive ratio\r\nof nutrition to calories, the other is lousy food. (Schuphan, 1965)\r\nHere's another example I hope will really dent the certainties the\r\nLinda Clarkites. Potatoes can range in protein from eight to eleven\r\npercent, depending on the soil that produced them and if they were\r\nor were not irrigated. Grown dry (very low yielding) on semiarid\r\nsoils, potatoes can be a high-protein staff of life. Heavily\r\nirrigated and fertilized so as to produce bulk yield instead of\r\nnutrition, they'll produce two or three times the tonnage, but at 8\r\npercent protein instead of 11 percent. Not only does the protein\r\ncontent drop just as much as yield is boosted, the amino acid ratios\r\nchange markedly, the content of scarce nutritional minerals drops\r\nmassively, and the caloric content increases. In short, subsisting\r\non irrigated commercially-grown potatoes, or on those grown on\r\nrelatively infertile soils receiving abundant rainfall will make you\r\nfat and sick. They're a lot like manioc.\r\n\r\nHere's another. Wheat can range from 7 to 19 percent protein. Before\r\nthe industrial era ruined most wheat by turning it into white flour,\r\nwheat-eating peoples from regions where the cereal naturally\r\ncontains abundant protein tended to be tall, healthy and long-lived.\r\nWheat-eating humans from regions that produce low protein grain\r\ntended to be small, sickly and short-lived. (McCarrison, 1921, 1936,\r\n1982; Albrecht, 1975)\r\n\r\nEven cows have to pay attention to where their grass is coming from.\r\nSome green grass is over 15 percent protein and contains lots of\r\ncalcium, phosphorus and magnesium to build strong bodies. Other\r\nequally or even better looking green grass contains only six or\r\nseven percent protein and contains little calcium, phosphorus or\r\nmagnesium. Cows forced to eat only this poor type of grass can\r\nliterally starve to death with full bellies. And they have a hard\r\ntime breeding successfully. The reason for the difference: different\r\nsoil fertility profiles. (Albrecht, 1975)\r\n\r\nWhen people ate local, those living on fertile soils or getting a\r\nsignificant portion of their diet from the sea and who because of\r\nphysical isolation from industrial foods did not make a practice of\r\neating empty calories tended to live a long time and be very\r\nhealthy. But those unfortunates on poor soils or with unwise\r\ncultural life-styles tended to be short-lived, diseased, small,\r\nweak, have bad teeth, and etc. The lesson here is that Homo Sapiens\r\ncan adapt to many different dietaries, but like any other animal,\r\nthe one thing we can't adapt to is a dietary deficient in nutrition.\r\n\r\nSo here's another \"statistic\" to reconsider. Most people believe\r\nthat due to modern medical wonders, we live longer than we used to.\r\nActually, that depends. Compared to badly nourished populations of a\r\ncentury ago, yes! We do. Chemical medicine keeps sickly, poorly\r\nnourished people going a lot longer (though one wonders about the\r\nquality of their dreary existences.) I hypothesize that before the\r\ntime most farmers purchased and baked with white flour and sold\r\ntheir whole, unground wheat, many rural Americans (the ones on good\r\nsoil, not all parts of North America have rich soil) eating from\r\ntheir own self-sufficient farms, lived as long or even longer than\r\nwe do today. You also have to wonder who benefits from promulgating\r\nthis mistaken belief about longevity. Who gets rich when we are\r\nsick? And what huge economic interests are getting rich helping make\r\nus sick?\r\n\r\nThe Human Comedy\r\n\r\nI know most of my readers have been heavily indoctrinated about food\r\nand think they already know the truth about dietetics. I also know\r\nthat so much information (and misinformation) is coming out about\r\ndiet that most of my readers are massively confused about the\r\nsubject. These are two powerful reasons many readers will look with\r\ndisbelief at what this chapter has to say and take no action on my\r\ndata, even to prove me wrong.\r\n\r\nLet me warn you. There is a deep-seated human tendency to put off\r\ntaking responsibilities, beautifully demonstrated by this old joke.\r\n\r\nA 14 year old boy was discovered masturbating by his father, who\r\nsaid, \"son, you shouldn't do that! If you keep it up you'll\r\neventually go blind!\"\r\n\r\n\"But father,\" came the boy's quick reply. \"It feels good. How about\r\nif I don't quit until I need to wear glasses?\"\r\n\r\nThe Organic Versus Chemical Feud\r\n\r\nNow, regrettably, and at great personal risk to my reputation, I\r\nmust try to puncture the very favorite belief of food religionists,\r\nthe doctrine that organically grown food is as nutritious as food\r\ncan possibly be, Like Woody Allen's brown-rice-eating friends,\r\npeople think if you eat Organic foods, you will inevitably live a\r\nvery long time and be very healthy. Actually, the Organic vs.\r\nchemical feud is in many ways false. Many (not all) samples of\r\norganically grown food are as low or lower in nutrition as foods\r\nraised with chemical fertilizers. Conversely, wisely using chemical\r\nfertilizers (not pesticides) can greatly increase the nutritional\r\nvalue of food. Judiciously used Organic fertilizing substances can\r\nalso do that as well or better. And in either case, using chemical\r\nfertilizers or so-called organic fertilizers, to maximize nutrition\r\nthe humus content of the soil must be maintained. But, raising soil\r\norganic matter levels too high can result in a massive reduction in\r\nthe nutritional content of the food being grown--a very frequent\r\nmistake on the part of Organic devotees. In other words, growing\r\nnutrition is a science, and is not a matter of religion.\r\n\r\nThe food I fed to my daughter in childhood, though Organic according\r\nto Rodale and the certification bureaucrats, though providing this\r\norganic food to my family and clients gave me a feeling of\r\nself-righteousness, was not grown with an understanding of the\r\nnutritional consequences of electing to use one particular Organic\r\nfertilizing substance over another. So we and a lot of regional\r\nOrganic market gardeners near us that we bought from, were raising\r\nfood that was far from ideally nutritious. At least though, our food\r\nwas free of pesticide residues.\r\n\r\nThe real dichotomy in food is not \"chemical\" fertilizer versus\r\n\"Organic,\" It is between industrial food and quality food. What I\r\nmean by industrial food is that which is raised with the intention\r\nof maximizing profit or yield. There is no contradiction between\r\nraising food that the \"rabbis\" running Organic certification\r\nbureaucracies would deem perfectly \"kosher\" and raising that same\r\nfood to make the most possible money or the biggest harvest. When a\r\nfarmer grows for money, they want to produce the largest number of\r\nbushels, crates, tons, bales per acre. Their criteria for success is\r\nprimarily unit volume. Many gardeners think the same way. To\r\nmaximize bulk yield they build soil fertility in a certain direction\r\n(organically or chemically) and choose varieties that produce\r\ngreater bulk. However, nature is ironic in this respect. The most\r\nnutritious food is always lower yielding. The very soil management\r\npractices that maximize production simultaneously reduce nutrition.\r\n\r\nThe real problem we are having about our health is not that there\r\nare residues of pesticides in our food. The real problem is that\r\nthere are only residues of nutrition left in our foods. Until our\r\nculture comes to understand this and realizes that the health costs\r\nof accepting less than optimum food far exceeds the profits made by\r\ngrowing bulk, it will not be possible to frequently find the\r\nultimate of food quality in the marketplace, organically grown or\r\nnot. It will not be possible to find food that is labeled or\r\nidentified according to its real nutritional value. The best I can\r\nsay about Organic food these days is that it probably is no less\r\nnutritious than chemically-grown food while at least it is free of\r\npesticide residues.\r\n\r\nThe Poor Start\r\n\r\nFor this reason it makes sense to take vitamins and food\r\nsupplements, to be discussed in the next chapter. And because our\r\nfood supply, Organic or \"conventional,\" is far from optimum, if a\r\nperson wants to be and remain healthy and have a life span that\r\napproaches their genetic potential (and that potential, it seems,\r\napproaches or exceeds a century), it is essential that empty\r\ncalories are rigorously avoided.\r\n\r\nAn accurate and quick-to-respond indicator of how well we are doing\r\nin terms of getting enough nutrition is the state of our teeth. One\r\nfamous dentally-oriented nutritional doctor, Melvin Page, suggested\r\nthat as long as overall nutrition was at least 75 percent of\r\nperfection, the body chemistry could support healthy teeth and gums\r\nuntil death. By healthy here Page means free of cavities, no bone\r\nloss around the teeth (no wobblers), no long-in-the-teeth mouths\r\nfrom receding gums, no gum diseases at all. But when empty calories\r\nor devitalized foods or misdigestion cuts our nutrient intake we\r\nbegin experiencing tooth decay, gum disease and bone loss in the\r\njaw. How are your teeth?\r\n\r\nI suppose you could say that I have a food religion, but mine is to\r\neat so that the equation Nutrition = Health / Calories is strongly\r\nin my favor.\r\n\r\nBack to my daughter's teeth. Yes, I innocently fed her less than\r\nideally nutritious food, but at that time I couldn't buy ideal food\r\neven had I known what I wanted, nor did I have any scientific idea\r\nof how to produce ideal food, nor actually, could I have done so on\r\nthe impoverished, leached-out clay soil at Great Oaks School even\r\nhad I known how. The Organic doctrine says that you can build a\r\nGarden of 'Eatin with large quantities of compost until any old clay\r\npit or gravel heap produces highly nutritious food. This idea is not\r\nreally true. Sadly, what is true about organic matter in soil is\r\nthat when it is increased very much above the natural level one\r\nfinds in untilled soil in the climate you're working with, the\r\nnutritional content of the food begins to drop markedly. I know this\r\nassertion is shocking and perhaps threatening to those who believe\r\nin the Organic system; I am sorry.\r\n\r\nBut there is another reason my daughter's teeth were not perfect,\r\nprobably could not have been perfect no matter what we fed her, and\r\nwhy she will probably have at least some health problems as she ages\r\nno matter how perfectly she may choose to eat from here on. My\r\ndaughters had what Dr. G.T. Wrench called \"a poor start.\" Not as\r\npoor as it could have been by any means, but certainly less than\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nYou see, the father has very little to do with the health of the\r\nchild, unless he happens to carry some particularly undesirable\r\ngene. It is the mother who has the job of constructing the fetus out\r\nof prepartum nourishment and her own body's nutritional reserves.\r\nThe female body knows from trillenia of instinctual experience that\r\nadequate nutrition from the current food supply during pregnancy can\r\nnot always be assured, so the female body stores up very large\r\nquantities of minerals and vitamins and enzymes against that very\r\npossibility. When forming a fetus these reserves are drawn down and\r\ndepleted. It is virtually impossible during the pregnancy itself for\r\na mother to extract sufficient nutrition from current food to build\r\na totally healthy fetus, no matter how nourishing the food she is\r\neating may be. Thus a mother-to-be needs to be spending her entire\r\nchildhood and her adolescence (and have adequate time between\r\nbabies), building and rebuilding her reserves.\r\n\r\nA mother-to-be also started out at her own birth with a vitally\r\nimportant stock of nutritional reserves, reserves put there during\r\nher own fetal development. If that \"start\" was less than ideal, the\r\nmother-to-be (as fetus) got \"pinched\" and nutritionally shortchanged\r\nin certain, predictable ways. Even minor mineral fetal deficiencies\r\ndegrade the bone structure: the fetus knows it needs nutritional\r\nreserves more than it needs to have a full-sized jaw bone or a wide\r\npelvic girdle, and when deprived of maximum fetal nourishment, these\r\nnon-vital bones become somewhat smaller. Permanently. If mineral\r\ndeficiencies continue into infancy and childhood, these same bones\r\ncontinue to be shortchanged, and the child ends up with a very\r\nnarrow face, a jaw bone far too small to hold all the teeth, and in\r\nwomen, a small oven that may have trouble baking babies. More\r\nimportantly, those nutrient reserves earmarked especially for making\r\nbabies are also deficient. So a deficient mother not only shows\r\ncertain structural evidence of physiological degeneration, but she\r\nmakes deficient babies. A deficient female baby at birth is unlikely\r\nto completely overcome her bad start before she herself has\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nSo with females, the quality of a whole lifetime's nutrition, and\r\nthe life-nutrition of her mother (and of her mother's mother as\r\nwell) has a great deal to do with the outcome of a pregnancy. The\r\nsins of the mother can really be visited unto the third and fourth\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nThis reality was powerfully demonstrated in the 1920s by a medical\r\ndoctor, Francis Pottenger. He was not gifted with a good bedside\r\nmanner. Rather than struggling with an unsuccessful clinical\r\npractice, Dr. Pottenger decided to make his living running a medical\r\ntesting laboratory in Pasadena, California. Dr. Pottenger earned his\r\ndaily bread performing a rather simple task, assaying the potency of\r\nadrenal hormone extracts. At that time, adrenaline, a useful drug to\r\ntemporarily rescue people close to death, was extracted from the\r\nadrenal glands of animals. However, the potency of these crude\r\nextracts varied greatly. Being a very powerful drug, it was\r\nessential to measure exactly how strong your extract was so its\r\ndosage could be controlled.\r\n\r\nQuantitative organic chemistry was rather crude in those days.\r\nInstead of assaying in a test tube, Dr. Pottenger kept several big\r\ncages full of cats that he had adrenalectomized. Without their own\r\nadrenals, the cats could not live more than a short time By finding\r\nout how much extract was required to keep the cats from failing, he\r\ncould measure the strength of the particular batch.\r\n\r\nDr. Pottenger's cats were economically valuable so he made every\r\neffort to keep them healthy, something that proved to be\r\ndisappointingly difficult. He kept his cats clean, in airy, bright\r\nquarters, fed them to the very best of his ability on pasteurized\r\nwhole milk, slaughterhouse meat and organs (cats in the wild eat\r\norgan meats first and there are valuable vitamins and other\r\nsubstances in organ meats that don't exist in muscle tissue). The\r\nmeat was carefully cooked to eliminate any parasites, and the diet\r\nwas supplemented with cod liver oil. However, try as he might,\r\nPottenger's cats were sickly, lived short and had to be frequently\r\nreplaced. Usually they bred poorly and died young of bacterial\r\ninfections, there being no antibiotics in the 1920s. I imagine Dr.\r\nPottenger was constantly visiting the animal shelter and perhaps\r\neven paid quarters out the back door to a steady stream of young\r\nboys who brought him cats in burlap sacks from who knows where, no\r\nquestions asked.\r\n\r\nDr. Pottenger's assays must have been accurate, for his business\r\ngrew and grew. Eventually he needed more cats than he had cages to\r\nhouse, so he built a big, roofed, on-the-ground pen outdoors.\r\nBecause he was overworked, he was less careful about the feeding of\r\nthese extra animals. They got the same pasteurized milk and\r\ncod-liver oil, but he did not bother to cook their slaughterhouse\r\nmeat. Then, a small miracle happened. This poorly cared for cage of\r\ncats fed on uncooked meat became much healthier than the others,\r\nsuffering far fewer bacterial infections or other health problems.\r\nThen another miracle happened. Dr. Pottenger began to meditate on\r\nthe first miracle.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him that cats in the wild did not cook their food;\r\nperhaps cats had a digestive system that couldn't process or\r\nassimilate much out of cooked food. Perhaps the problem he had been\r\nhaving was not because the cats were without adrenal glands but\r\nbecause they were without sustenance, suffering a sort of slow\r\nstarvation in the midst of plenty. So Dr. Pottenger set up some cat\r\nfeeding experiments.\r\n\r\nThere were four possible combinations of his regimen: raw meat and\r\nunpasteurized milk; raw meat and pasteurized milk; cooked meat and\r\nraw milk; cooked meat and pasteurized milk, this last one being what\r\nhe had been feeding all along. So he divided his cats into four\r\ngroups and fed each group differently. The first results of\r\nPottenger's experiments were revealed quickly though the most\r\nvaluable results took longer to see. The cats on raw meat and raw\r\nmilk did best. The ones on raw meat and pasteurized milk did okay\r\nbut not as well. The ones on cooked meat and raw milk did even less\r\nwell and those on all cooked food continued to do as poorly as ever.\r\n\r\nClearly, cats can't digest cooked food; all animals do better fed on\r\nwhat they can digest. A lot of people have taken Pottenger's data\r\nand mistakenly concluded that humans also should eat only raw food.\r\nThis idea is debatable. However, the most important result of the\r\ncat experiments took years to reveal itself and is not paid much\r\nattention to, probably because its implications are very depressing.\r\nDr. Pottenger continued his experiments for several generations. It\r\nwas the transgenerational changes that showed the most valuable\r\nlesson. Over several generations, the cats on all raw foods began to\r\nalter their appearance. Their faces got wider, their pelvic girdles\r\nbroader, bones solider, teeth better. They began to breed very\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nAfter quite a few generations, the healthiest group, the one on all\r\nraw foods, seemed to have improved as much as it could. So Dr.\r\nPottenger took some of these cats and began feeding them only cooked\r\nfood to study the process of nutritional degeneration. After three\r\n\"de\"generations on cooked fodder the group had deteriorated so much\r\nthat the animals could barely breed. Their faces had become narrow,\r\ntheir teeth crooked, their pelvic girdles narrow, their bones and\r\nbody structure very small, and their dispositions poor. Mothers\r\nwouldn't nurse their young and sometimes became cannibalistic. They\r\nno longer lived very long.\r\n\r\nBefore the degenerating group completely lost the ability to breed,\r\nPottenger began to again feed them all raw food. It took four\r\ngenerations on a perfect, raw food diet before some perfect\r\nappearing individuals showed up in the group. It takes longer to\r\nrepair the damage than it does to cause it and it takes generations\r\nof unflagging persistence.\r\n\r\nI think much the same process has happened to humans in this\r\ncentury. With the invention of the roller mill and the consequent\r\ndegradation of our daily bread to white flour; with the birth of\r\nindustrial farming and the generalized lowering of the nutritional\r\ncontent of all of our crops; our overall ratio of nutrition to\r\ncalories worsened. Then it worsened again because we began to have\r\nindustrial food manufacturing and national brand prepared food\r\nmarketing systems; we began subsisting on devitalized, processed\r\nfoods. The result has been an even greater worsening of our ratio of\r\nnutrition to calories.\r\n\r\nAnd just like Pottenger's cats, we civilized humans in so-called\r\nadvanced countries are losing the ability to breed, our willingness\r\n(or the energy) to mother our young; we're losing our good humor in\r\nthe same way Pottenger's degenerated cats became bad tempered. As a\r\ngroup we feel so poorly that we desperately need to feel better\r\nfast, and what better way to do that than with drugs. Is it any\r\nwonder that the United States, the country furthest down the road of\r\nindustrial food degeneration, spends 14 percent of its gross\r\ndomestic product on medical services. Any wonder that so many babies\r\nare born by Cesarean, any wonder that so many of our children have\r\ncrooked teeth needing an orthodontist? The most depressing aspect of\r\nthis comes into view when considering that Pottenger's cats took\r\nfour generations on perfect food to repair most of the nutritional\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nIn the specific case of my daughter, I know somethings about the\r\nnutritional history of her maternal ancestors. My daughter's\r\ngrandmother grew up on a Saskatchewan farm. Though they certainly\r\ngrew their own rich wheat on virgin semi-arid prairie soil, I'm sure\r\nthe family bought white flour at the store for daily use. Still,\r\nthere was a garden and a cow producing raw milk and free-range\r\nfertile eggs and chicken and other animals. There probably were lots\r\nof canned vegetables in winter, canned but still highly nutritious\r\nbecause of the fertility of their prairie garden. My mother\r\nconsequently had perfect teeth until the Great Depression forced her\r\nto live for too many years on lard and white bread.\r\n\r\nDuring this time of severe malnutrition she had her three babies.\r\nThe first one got the best of her nutritional reserves. The second,\r\nborn after the worst of the malnutrition, was very small and weak\r\nand had a hard time growing up. Fortunately for me, for a few years\r\nbefore I (the last child) was born, the worst of the economic times\r\nhad past and the family had been living on a farm. There were\r\nvegetables and fresh raw milk and fruit. My mother had two good\r\nyears to rebuild her nutritional reserves. But \"Grannybell\" did not\r\nmanaged to replace enough. Shortly after I was born my mother lost\r\nevery one of her teeth all at once. The bone just disappeared around\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThus, I was born deficient. And my childhood and adolescent\r\nnutrition was poor too: soda crackers, pasteurized processed\r\nartificial cheese, evaporated milk from cans, hotdogs and canned\r\nbeans, hotdogs and cabbage. It wasn't until I was pregnant with my\r\nfirst baby that I started to straighten up my diet. I continued\r\neating very well after my first daughter, so my youngest daughter\r\nhad another three years of good diet to draw on. Thus both my own\r\ndaughters got a somewhat better start than I had had.\r\n\r\nMy teeth were not as good as my mother's had been before those years\r\nof malnutrition took them all. Instead of perfect straight undecayed\r\nteeth like a healthy farm girl should have, mine were somewhat\r\ncrowded, with numerous cavities. My jaw bone had not received enough\r\nminerals to develop to its full size. My pelvic girdle also was\r\nsmaller than my mother's was. I had had a poor start.\r\n\r\nMy daughters did better. The older one (the first child typically\r\ngets the best of the nutritional reserves) has such a wide jaw that\r\nthere are small spaces between her teeth. My second daughter has\r\nonly one crooked tooth, she has wider, more solid hips, stronger\r\nbones and a broader face than I do. If my younger daughter will but\r\nfrom this point in her life, eat perfectly and choose her food\r\nwisely to responsibly avoid empty calories and maximize her ratio of\r\nnutrition to calories, her daughter (if she gives us granddaughters\r\nas her older sister already has done) may exhibit the perfect\r\nphysiology that her genes carry.\r\n\r\nAlong the lines of helping you avoid empty calories I will give you\r\nsome information about various common foods that most people don't\r\nknow and that most books about food and health don't tell, or\r\nmisunderstand.\r\n\r\nButter, Margarine and Fats in General.\r\n\r\nRecently, enormous propaganda has been generated against eating\r\nbutter. Its been smeared in the health magazines as a saturated\r\nanimal fat, one containing that evil substance, cholesterol. Many\r\npeople are now avoiding it and instead, using margarine.\r\n\r\nComposition of Oils\r\n\r\n               Saturated Monosaturated Unsaturated\r\nButter         66%       30%            4%\r\nCoconut Oil    87%        6%            2%\r\nCottonseed Oil 26%       18%           52%\r\nOlive Oil      13%       74%            8%\r\nPalm Oil       49%       37%            9%\r\nSoybean Oil    14%       24%           58%\r\nSunflower Oil   4%        8%           83%\r\nSafflower Oil   3%        5%           87%\r\nSesame Oil      5%        9%           80%\r\nPeanut Oil      6%       12%           76%\r\nCorn Oil        3%        7%           84%\r\n\r\nThis is a major and serious misunderstanding. First of all,\r\nmargarine is almost indigestible, chemically very much like\r\nshortening--an artificially saturated or hydrogenated vegetable fat.\r\nHydrogenated fats can't be properly broken down by the body's\r\ndigestive enzymes, adding to the body's toxic load. Margarine, being\r\na chemically-treated vegetable oil with artificial yellow color and\r\nartificial flavorings to make it seem like butter, also releases\r\nfree radicals in the body that accelerate aging. So, to avoid the\r\ndangers of eating cholesterol-containing butter, people eat\r\nsomething far worse for them!\r\n\r\nThere are severe inconsistencies with the entire\r\n\"cholesterol-is-evil\" theory. Ethnic groups like the Danes, who eat\r\nenormous quantities of cholesterol-containing foods, have little\r\ncirculatory disease. Actually, the liver itself produces\r\ncholesterol; it's presence in the blood is an important part of the\r\nbody chemistry. Cholesterol only becomes a problem because of\r\nderanged body chemistry due to the kind of overall malnutrition\r\nAmericans usually experience on their junk food diets. Avoiding\r\ncholesterol in foods does little good, but eating a low-fat,\r\nlow-sugar, complex-carbohydrate (whole foods) diet high in minerals\r\ndoes lower blood cholesterol enormously.\r\n\r\nActually, high quality fresh (not rancid) butter in moderate\r\nquantities is about the finest fat a person could eat. But high\r\nquality butter is almost unobtainable. First of all, it has to be\r\nraw, made from unpasteurized cream. Second, butter can contain very\r\nhigh levels of fat-soluble vitamins, but doesn't have to.\r\nVitamin-rich butter's color is naturally bright yellow, almost\r\norange. This color does not come from a test tube. Pale yellow\r\nbutter as is found in the commercial trade was probably almost white\r\nbefore it was artificially tinted. Butter from grass-pastured cows\r\nnaturally changes from yellow-orange to white and back again through\r\nthe year as the seasons change. Spring grass, growing in the most\r\nintense sunlight of the year contains very high levels of\r\nchlorophyll and vitamins. Cows eating this grass put high levels of\r\nvitamins A and D into their cream, evidenced by the orange color of\r\nvitamin A. By July, natural butter has degraded to medium-yellow in\r\ncolor. By August, it is pale yellow. Industrial dairy cows fed\r\nexclusively on hay or artificial, processed feeds (lacking in these\r\nvitamins), produce butterfat that is almost white.\r\n\r\nI prefer to obtain my butter from a neighbor who has several dairy\r\ncows grazing on fertile bottom land pasture. We always freeze a\r\nyear's supply in late spring when butter is at its best.\r\nInterestingly, that is also the time of year when my neighbor gets\r\nthe most production from her cows and is most willing to part with\r\n25 pounds of extra butter.\r\n\r\nIn general, fats are poor foods that should be avoided. Their ratio\r\nof nutrition to calories is absolutely the worst of all food types,\r\nexcept perhaps for pure white sugar, which is all calories and\r\nabsolutely no nutrition (this is also true for other forms of sugar.\r\nHoney, too, contains almost no nutrition.). Gram for gram, fats\r\ncontain many more calories than do sugars or starches. Yet gram for\r\ngram, fats contain virtually no nutrition except for small\r\nquantities of essential fatty acids.\r\n\r\nThe perverse reason people like to eat fats is that they are very\r\nhard to digest and greatly slow the digestive action of the stomach.\r\nAnother way of saying that is that they have a very high satiety\r\nvalue. Fats make a person feel full for a long time because their\r\npresence in the stomach makes it churn and churn and churn. Fats\r\ncoat proteins and starches and delay their digestion, often causing\r\nthem to begin fermenting (starches) or putrefying (proteins) in the\r\ndigestive tract.\r\n\r\nThe best fats contain high levels of monosaturated vegetable oils\r\nthat have never been exposed to heat or chemicals--like virgin olive\r\noil. Use small quantities of olive oil for salad dressing.\r\nMonosaturated fats also have far less tendency to go rancid than any\r\nother type. Vegetable oils with high proportions of unsaturated\r\nfats, the kind that all the authorities push because they contain no\r\ncholesterol, go rancid rapidly upon very brief exposure to air. The\r\ndanger here is that rancidity in vegetable oil is virtually\r\nunnoticeable. Rancid animal fat on the other hand, smells \"off.\"\r\nEating rancid oil is a sure-fire way to accelerate aging, invite\r\ndegenerative conditions in general, and enhance the likelihood of\r\ncancer. I recommend that you use only high-quality virgin olive oil,\r\nthe only generally-available fat that is largely monosaturated.\r\n(Pearson and Shaw, 1983)\r\n\r\nWhen you buy vegetable oil, even olive oil, get small bottles so you\r\nuse them up before the oil has much time being exposed to air (as\r\nyou use the oil air fills the bottle) or, if you buy olive oil in a\r\nlarge can to save money, immediately upon opening it, transfer the\r\noil to pint jars filled to the very brim to exclude virtually all\r\nair, and seal the jars securely. In either case, keep now-opened,\r\nin-use small bottles of oil in the refrigerator because rancidity is\r\nsimply the combination of oil with oxygen from the air and this\r\nchemical reaction is accelerated at warmer temperatures and slowed\r\ngreatly at cold ones.\r\n\r\nChemical reactions typically double in speed with every 10 degrees\r\nC. increase in temperature. So oil goes rancid about six times\r\nfaster at normal room temperature than it does in the fridge. If\r\nyou'll think about the implications of this data you'll see there\r\nare two powerful reasons not to fry food. One, the food is coated\r\nwith oil and gains in satiety value at the expense of becoming\r\nrelatively indigestible and productive of toxemia. Secondly, if\r\nfrying occurs at 150 degrees Centigrade and normal room temperature\r\nis 20 degrees Centigrade, then oil goes rancid 2 to the 13th power\r\nfaster in the frying pan, or about 8,200 times faster. Heating oil\r\nfor only ten minutes in a hot skillet induces as much rancidity as\r\nabout 6 weeks of sitting open and exposed to air at room\r\ntemperature. Think about that the next time you're tempted to eat\r\nsomething from a fast food restaurant where the hot fat in the deep\r\nfryer has been reacting with oxygen all day, or even for several\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nBack to butter, where we started. If you must have something\r\ntraditionally northern European on your bread, you are far better\r\noff to use butter, not margarine. However, Mediterranean peoples\r\ntraditionally dip their bread in high-quality extra-virgin olive oil\r\nthat smells and tastes like olives. Its delicious, why not try it.\r\nBut best yet, put low-sugar fruit preserves on your toast or develop\r\na taste for dry toast. Probably the finest use for butter is melted\r\nover steamed vegetables. This way only small quantities are needed\r\nand the fat goes on something that is otherwise very easy to digest\r\nso its presence will not produce as many toxins in the digestive\r\ntract.\r\n\r\nMilk, Meat, And Other Protein Foods\r\n\r\nSpeaking of butter, how about milk? The dairy lobby is very powerful\r\nin North America. Its political clout and campaign contributions\r\nhave the governments of both the United States and especially that\r\nof Canada eating out of its hand (literally), providing the dairy\r\nindustry with price supports. Because of these price supports, in\r\nCanada cheese costs half again more than it does in the United\r\nStates. The dairy lobby is also very cozy with the medical\r\nprofession so licensed nutritionists constantly bombard us with\r\n\"drink milk\" and \"cheese is good for you\" propaganda.\r\n\r\nAnd people naturally like dairy foods. They taste good and are\r\nfat-rich with a high satiety value. Dairy makes you feel full for a\r\nlong time. Dairy is also high in protein; protein is hard to digest\r\nand this too keeps one feeling full for a long time. But many\r\npeople, especially those from cultures who traditionally\r\n(genetically) didn't have dairy cows, particularly Africans, Asians\r\nand Jews, just do not produce the enzymes necessary to digest cows\r\nmilk. Some individuals belonging to these groups can digest goats\r\nmilk. Some can't digest any kind except human breast milk. And some\r\ncan digest fermented milk products like yogurt and kiefer. Whenever\r\none eats a protein food that is not fully digestible, it putrefies\r\nin the digestive tract, with all the bad consequences previously\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nBut no one, absolutely no one can fully digest pasteurized cows\r\nmilk, which is what most people use because they have been made to\r\nfear cow-transmitted diseases and/or they are forced to use\r\npasteurized dairy products by health authorities. I suspect drinking\r\npasteurized milk or eating cheese made from pasteurized milk is one\r\nof the reasons so many people develop allergic reactions to milk.\r\nYet many states do not allow unpasteurized dairy to be sold, even\r\nprivately between neighbors. To explain all this, I first have to\r\nexplain a bit more about protein digestion in general and then talk\r\nabout allergies and how they can be created.\r\n\r\nProteins are long, complex molecules, intricate chains whose\r\nindividual links are amino acids. Proteins are the very stuff of\r\nlife. All living protoplasm, animal or plant, is largely composed of\r\nproteins. There are virtually an infinite number of different\r\nproteins but all are composed of the same few dozen amino acids\r\nhooked together in highly variable patterns. Amino acids themselves\r\nare highly complex organic molecules too. The human body\r\ncustom-assembles all its proteins from amino acids derived from\r\ndigesting protein foods, and can also manufacture small quantities\r\nof certain of its own amino acids to order, but there are eight\r\namino acids it cannot make and these are for that reason called\r\nessential amino acids. Essential amino acids must be contained in\r\nthe food we eat. .\r\n\r\nFew proteins are water soluble. When we eat proteins the digestive\r\napparatus must first break them down into their water-soluble\r\ncomponents, amino acids, so these can pass into the blood and then\r\nbe reassembled into the various proteins the body uses. The body has\r\nan interesting mechanism to digest proteins; it uses enzymes. An\r\nenzyme is like the key for a lock. It is a complex molecule that\r\nlatches to a protein molecule and then breaks it apart into amino\r\nacids. Then the enzyme finds yet another protein molecule to free.\r\nEnzymes are efficient, reusable many many times.\r\n\r\nEnzymes that digest proteins are effective only in the very acid\r\nenvironment of the stomach, are manufactured by the pancreas and are\r\nreleased when protein foods are present. The stomach then releases\r\nhydrochloric acid and churns away like a washing machine, mixing the\r\nenzymes and the acid with the proteins until everything has\r\ndigested.\r\n\r\nSo far so good. That's how its supposed to be. But. Dr. Henry\r\nBieler, who wrote Food Is Your Best Medicine, came up with the\r\nfinest metaphor I know of to explain how protein digestion goes\r\nwrong. He compared all proteins to the white of an egg (which is\r\nactually a form of protein). When raw and liquid, the long chains of\r\nalbumen (egg white) proteins are in their natural form. However,\r\ncook the egg and the egg white both solidifies and becomes smaller.\r\nWhat has happened is that the protein chains have shriveled and\r\nliterally tied themselves into knots. Once this happens, pancreatic\r\nenzymes no longer fit and cannot separate all the amino acids.\r\nCooked proteins may churn and churn and churn in the presence of\r\nacid and pancreatic enzymes but they will not digest completely.\r\nPart becomes water soluble; part does not.\r\n\r\nBut, indigestible protein is still subject to an undesirable form of\r\nconsumption in the gut. Various bacteria make their home in our\r\nairless, warm intestines. Some of these live on protein. In the\r\nprocess of consuming undigested proteins, they release highly toxic\r\nsubstances. They poison us.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the white of an egg is also true of flesh foods and\r\ndairy. Raw meat and raw fish are actually easily digestible foods\r\nand if not wrongly combined will not produce toxemia in a person\r\nthat still has a strong pancreas. However, eating raw meat and fish\r\ncan be a dicey proposition, both for reasons of cultural sensibility\r\n(people think it is disgusting) and because there may be living\r\nparasites in uncooked flesh that can attack, sicken and even kill\r\npeople. It has been argued that a healthy stomach containing its\r\nproper degree of acidity provides an impenetrable barrier to\r\nparasites. Perhaps. But how many of us are that healthy these days?\r\nCooked flesh and fish seems more delicious to our refined, civilized\r\nsensibilities, but are a poor food.\r\n\r\nIn my household we have no moral objection to eating meat. We do\r\nhave an ethical objection in that meat eating does not contribute to\r\nour health. But still, we do eat it. A few times a year, for\r\ntraditional celebrations we may invite the children over and cook a\r\nturkey. A few times for Thanksgiving when the children were going\r\nthrough their holier-than-thou vegetarian stage, I purchased the\r\nlargest, thickest porterhouse steak I could find at the natural meat\r\nstore and ate it medium-rare, with relish. It was delicious. It made\r\nme feel full for hours and hours and hours. I stayed flat on the\r\ncouch and groggily worked on digesting it all evening. After that\r\nI'd had enough of meat to last for six months.\r\n\r\nWhen milk is pasteurized, the proteins in it are also altered in\r\nstructure. Not so severely as egg white is altered by cooking\r\nbecause pasteurization happens at a lower temperature. But altered\r\nnone the less. And made less digestible. Pasteurizing also makes\r\nmilk calcium far less assimilable. That's ironic because so many\r\npeople are drinking milk because they fear they need more calcium to\r\navoid osteoporosis and to give their children good teeth. What\r\npasteurized milk actually does to their children is make them\r\ncalcium deficient and makes the children toxic, provoking many\r\ncolds, ear infections, sinusitis, inflammations of the tonsils and\r\nlung infections, and, induces an allergy to milk in the children.\r\n\r\nThe Development Of Allergies\r\n\r\nThere are three ways a body can become allergic. (1) It can have a\r\ngenetic predisposition for a specific allergy to start with. (2) It\r\ncan be repeatedly exposed to an irritating substance such as pollen\r\nwhen, at the same time, the body's mechanism for dealing with\r\nirritations is weakened. Generally weak adrenals causes this because\r\nthe adrenal's job is to produce hormones that reduce inflammation.\r\nOnce the irritating substance succeeds at producing a significant\r\ninflammation, a secondary reaction may be set up, called an allergy.\r\nOnce established, an allergy is very hard to get rid of.\r\n\r\n(3) in a way very similar to the second, but instead of being\r\nirritated by an external substance, it is irritated by repeatedly\r\nfailing to properly, fully digest something. Pasteurized milk for\r\nexample, basically impossible to completely digest even in its\r\nlow-fat form, often sets up an allergy that applies to other forms\r\nof cows milk, even raw, unpasteurized cows milk or yogurt. Eating\r\ntoo much white flour can eventually set off a wheat allergy. My\r\nhusband developed a severe allergy to barley after drinking too much\r\nhome-brewed beer; he also became highly intolerant to alcohol. Now\r\nhe has allergic reactions to both alcohol and barley. And gets far\r\nsicker from drinking beer (two separate allergies) than from wheat\r\nbeer, hard liquor or wine (only one allergy).\r\n\r\nEating too much of any single food, or repeatedly eating too much of\r\nan otherwise very good food at one time, can eventually overwhelm\r\nthe body's ability to digest it fully. Then, the finest whole food\r\nproducts may set up an allergic reaction. Worse, this allergic\r\nreaction itself subsequently prevents proper digestion even when\r\nonly moderate quantities are eaten.\r\n\r\nAn allergy may not be recognized as an allergy because it may not\r\nmanifest as the instant skin rash or stuffy nose or swollen glands\r\nor sticky eyes. that people usually think of when they think\r\n\"allergic reaction.\" Food allergies can cause many kinds of\r\nsymptoms, from sinusitis to psychosis, from asthma to arthritis,\r\nfrom hyperactivity to depression, insomnia to narcolepsy--and\r\ncommonly the symptoms don't manifest immediately after eating.\r\nFrequently, allergic reactions are so low grade as to be\r\nunnoticeable and may not produce an observable condition until many\r\nyears of their grinding down the vital force has passed. When the\r\ncondition finally appears it is hard to associate it with some food\r\nthat has been consumed for years, apparently with impunity.\r\n\r\nThus it is that many North Americans have developed allergies to\r\nwheat, dairy, soy products (because many soy foods are very hard to\r\ndigest), corn and eggs. These are such common, widespread,\r\nfrequently found allergies that anyone considering a dietary cause\r\nof their complaints might just cut all these foods out of the diet\r\nfor a few weeks just to see what happens. And individuals may be\r\nallergic to anything from broccoli to bacon, strawberries to bean\r\nsprouts. Unraveling food allergies sometimes requires the deductions\r\nof a Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\nHowever, food allergies are very easy to cure if you can get the\r\nsuffered to take the medicine. Inevitably, allergic reactions vanish\r\nin about five days of abstinence. Anyone with sufficient\r\nself-discipline to water fast for five days can cure themselves of\r\nall food allergies at one step. Then, by a controlled, gradual\r\nreintroduction of foods, they can discover which individual items\r\ncause trouble. See Coca's Pulse Test in the Appendix where you'll\r\nfind step-by-step instructions for allergy testing that are less\r\nrigorous, not requiring a preliminary fast.\r\n\r\nFlour, And Other Matters Relating To Seeds\r\n\r\nOne of the largest degradations to human health was caused by the\r\nroller mill. This apparently profitable machine permitted the miller\r\nto efficiently separate wheat flour into three components: bran,\r\ngerm and endosperm. Since bread made without bran and germ is\r\nlighter and appears more \"upper class\" it became instantly popular.\r\nFlour without germ and bran also had an industrial application--it\r\ncould be stored virtually forever without being infested by insects\r\nbecause white flour does not contain enough nutrition to support\r\nlife. Most health conscious people are aware that white flour\r\nproducts won't support healthful human life either.\r\n\r\nEssentially, white flour's effect on humans is another demonstration\r\nof Health = Nutrition / Calories. When the bran and germ are\r\ndiscarded, remaining are the calories and much of the protein,\r\nlacking are many vitamins and minerals and other vital nutritional\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nWhole wheat bread has been called the staff of life. In ages past,\r\nhealthy cultures have made bread the predominant staple in their\r\ndiet. Does that mean you can just go to the bakery and buy whole\r\ngrain bread, or go to the healthfood store and buy organically grown\r\nwhole wheat flour, bake your own, and be as healthy as the ancients?\r\nSorry, the answer is almost certainly no. There are pitfalls, many\r\nof them, waiting for the unwary.\r\n\r\nWhite flour has one other advantage over whole wheat flour. It not\r\nonly remains free of insect infestation, it doesn't become stale\r\n(meaning rancid). In the wheat germ (where the embryo resides) there\r\nis considerable oil, containing among other things, about the best\r\nnatural source of vitamin E. This oil is highly unsaturated and once\r\nthe seed is ground the oil goes rancid in a matter of days. Whole\r\nwheat flour kept on the unrefrigerated shelf of the store is almost\r\ncertainly rancid. A lot of its other vitamin content has been\r\noxidized too. If the wheat flour had flowed directly from the\r\ngrinder into an airtight sack and from there directly to the\r\nfreezer, if it had been flash frozen and kept extremely cold, it\r\nmight have a storage life of some months. Of course that was not the\r\ncase. Maybe you're lucky and your healthfood store is one of the\r\nvery few that has its own small-scale flour mill and grinds daily.\r\nProbably not.\r\n\r\nHow about your baker's whole wheat bread? Where does the baker get\r\nflour? From the wholesaler's or distributor's warehouse! In fifty\r\npound kraftpaper sacks! How much time had elapsed from milling to\r\nwholesaler to baker to baking? The answer has to be in the order of\r\nmagnitude of weeks. And it might be months. Was the flour stored\r\nfrozen? Or airtight? Of course not.\r\n\r\nIf you want bread made from freshly ground flour you are almost\r\ncertainly have to grind and bake it yourself. Is it worth the\r\ntrouble? You bet. Once you've tasted real bread you'll instantly see\r\nby comparison what stale, rancid whole wheat flour tastes like.\r\nFreshly ground flour makes bread that can be the staff of life and\r\ncan enormously upgrade your health--if the wheat you use is any good.\r\n\r\nBut before we talk about wheat quality, a more few words of warning.\r\nIf you think wheat goes rancid rapidly, rye is even worse. Rye flour\r\ngoes bad so fast that when you buy it in the store it usually is the\r\nrye equivalent of white wheat flour. The germ has been removed. The\r\nbag may not say so. But it probably has. If you are going to make\r\nrye breads, even more reason to grind your own. Corn meal from the\r\ngrocery store has usually been degerminated too. If it hasn't been,\r\nthe oil in the seed's germ has probably gone rancid.\r\n\r\nGrinding flour at home is easy these days. There is an abundance of\r\nat-home milling products and no shortage of hype about them. You'll\r\nfind staunch advocates of stone mills. These produce the\r\nfinest-textured flour, but are costly. The sales pitch is that\r\nstones grind at low temperature and do not damage the oils (remember\r\nthe development of rancidity is a function of temperature) or the\r\nvitamins, which are also destroyed at high temperature. This\r\nassertion is half true. If you are going to store your flour it is\r\nfar better to grind it cool. However, if you are, as we do, going to\r\nimmediately bake your flour, what difference does it make if it gets\r\na little warm before baking. That only accelerates the action of the\r\nyeast.\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, stone mills grind slowly and are very fussy\r\nabout which grains they will grind. If the cereal is a bit moist or\r\nif the seed being ground is a little bit oily, the mill becomes\r\ninstantly blocked.\r\n\r\nSteel burr mills grind fast and coarsely and are inexpensive. Coarse\r\nflour makes heavy bread. The metal grinding faces tend to wear out\r\nand have to be replaced occasionally--if they can be replaced. Breads\r\non the heavy side are still delicious; for many years I made bread\r\nwith an inexpensive steel burr mill attachment that came with my\r\njuicer.\r\n\r\nSome steel burr mills will also grind oily seed like sesame and\r\nsunflower. However, oily seeds can be ground far more easily\r\nhalf-a-cup at a time in a little inexpensive electric spice/coffee\r\nmill, the sort with a single fast-spinning propeller.\r\n\r\nI currently think the best compromise are hammermills. The grain\r\ndribbles into a chamber full of fast-spinning teeth that literally\r\npound the grain into powder. Since air flows through with the grain\r\nthe flour is not heated very much. This type of mill is small, very\r\nfast, intermediate in price between steel mills and stone mill,\r\nlasts a long time, but when grinding, sounds like a Boeing 747 about\r\nto take off. It is essential to wear hearing protectors when using\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAwareness of bread quality is growing. One excellent new U.S.\r\nbusiness, called Great Harvest Bakery is a fast-growing national\r\nfranchise chain. They bake and sell only whole grain breads; all\r\ntheir wheat flour is freshly ground daily on the premises in the\r\nback. Unfortunately, as of the writing of this book, they do not\r\ngrind their rye flour but bring it in sacks. I can't recommend their\r\nrye breads. The founder of Great Harvest is a knowledgeable buyer\r\nwho fully understands my next topic, which is that wheat is not\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\nThere are great differences between hard bread wheats; being\r\norganically grown is no cure all for making good or nutritious\r\nbread. Great Harvest understands this and uses top quality grain\r\nthat is also Organic.\r\n\r\nWhen I first stated making my own bread from my own at-home-ground\r\nflour I was puzzled by variations in the dough. Sometimes the bread\r\nrose well and was spongy after baking like I wanted it to be.\r\nSometimes it kneaded stickily and ended up flat and crumbly like a\r\ncake. Since I had done everything the same way except that I may\r\nhave bought my wheat berries from different healthfood stores, I\r\nbegan to investigate the subject of wheat quality.\r\n\r\nThe element in the cereal that forms the rubbery sponge in risen\r\nbread so it doesn't crumble and rises high without collapsing, is\r\ngluten. The word glue derives from gluten. The gluten content of\r\nvarious wheats varies. Bread bakers use \"hard wheat\" because of its\r\nhigh gluten content. Gluten is a protein and gluten comprises most\r\nof the protein in bread wheat; the protein content and the gluten\r\ncontent are almost identical.\r\n\r\nTry this. Ask your healthfood store buyer or owner what the protein\r\ncontent is of the hard red wheat seeds they're selling. You'll\r\nalmost certainly get a puzzled look and your answer will almost\r\ncertainly be, \"we have Organic and conventional.\" Demand that the\r\nstore buyer ask this question of their distributor/wholesaler and\r\nthen report back to you. If the distributor deigns to answer, the\r\nanswer will be the same--I sell Organic or conventional hard red\r\nwheat. Period. When I got these non-answers I looked further and\r\ndiscovered that hard bread wheats run from about 12 percent protein\r\nto about 19 percent and this difference has everything to do with\r\nthe soil fertility (and to an extent the amount of rainfall during\r\nthe season), and almost nothing to do with Organic or conventional.\r\n\r\nThis difference also has everything to do with how your dough\r\nbehaves and how your bread comes out. And how well your bread\r\nnourishes you. Thirteen percent wheat will not make a decent\r\nloaf--fourteen percent is generally considered #2 quality and\r\ncomprises the bulk of cheap bread grain. When you hear in the\r\nfinancial news that a bushel of wheat is selling for a certain\r\nprice, they mean #2. Bakers compete for higher protein lots and pay\r\nfar higher prices for more protein.\r\n\r\nWe prefer our bread about 25% rye, but rye contains no gluten at\r\nall. Mix any rye flour into fourteen percent wheat flour and the\r\ndough becomes very heavy, won't rise, and after baking, crumbles. So\r\nI kept looking for better grain and finally discovered a\r\nknowledgeable lady that sold flour mills and who also was a serious\r\nbaker herself. She had located a source of quality wheat with an\r\nassayed protein content and sold it by the 50 pound sack. When I\r\nasked her if her wheat was Organic she said it was either sixteen or\r\nseventeen percent protein depending on whether you wanted hard red\r\nspring wheat or hard white spring wheat. Organic or conventional? I\r\npersisted. No, she said. High protein!\r\n\r\nSo, I said to myself, since protein content is a function of soil\r\nfertility and since my body needs protein, I figured I am better off\r\neating the best quality wheat, pesticide/herbicide residues (if\r\nthere are any) be damned. Think about it! The difference between\r\nseventeen percent and fourteen percent protein is about 25 percent.\r\nThat percentage difference is the key threshold of nutritional\r\ndeficiency that makes teeth fall out. We can't afford to accept 25%\r\ndegradations in our nutritional quality in something that we eat\r\nevery day and that forms the very basis of our dietary.\r\n\r\nPlease understand here that I am not saying that high protein wheats\r\ncan't be grown organically. They certainly can. The founder of Great\r\nHarvest Bakery performs a valuable service locating and securing\r\nhigh-protein lots of organically grown wheats for his outlets. But\r\noften as not Organic products are no more nourishing than those\r\ngrown with chemicals. Until the buyers at Organic whole food\r\nwholesalers get better educated about grain, obtaining one's\r\npersonal milling stock from them will be a dicey proposition.\r\n\r\nSometimes Organic cereal can be far worse than conventional. To make\r\na cereal Organic is a negative definition; if it hasn't had\r\nchemicals, then its Organic. Grain is one of the few foods that will\r\nstill produce economic yields of low quality seed on extremely\r\ninfertile soil or when half-smothered in weeds because herbicides\r\nweren't used for reasons of ideological purity. Vegetables will\r\nhardly produce anything under those conditions; carelessly grown\r\nfruits and vegetables are inevitably small, misshapen, unmarketable.\r\nBut seed cleaning equipment can remove the contamination of weed\r\nseeds in cereal grains (at a cost.)\r\n\r\nThe price the farmer receives for Organic cereal grain is much\r\nhigher, so it is possible to accept rather low yields or expend more\r\nmoney for cleaning out high levels of weed seeds from the field-run\r\nharvest, and still make a good profit. A lousy Organic cereal crop\r\nlike this might even make a higher profit because the farmer has\r\nbeen spared the expense of fertilization, of rotation, of weed\r\ncontrol. I remember once I bought a sack of Organic whole oats that\r\nwere the smallest, most shriveled, bitterest oats I've ever tried to\r\neat. We ended up throwing out that tiny, light (lacking density)\r\nseed in favor of using the \"conventional\" whole oats that were\r\nplump, heavy and sweet.\r\n\r\nWheat is not the only cereal that is damaged by industrial milling.\r\nSo are oats. Most consumers have never seen whole oats; they look\r\nvery much like wheat berries. But rolled oats become rancid and\r\nstale on the shelf much like wheat flour on the shelf.\r\n\r\nAnother pitfall about using whole grains is that to be nutritious\r\nthey must still be fresh enough to sprout vigorously. A seed is a\r\npackage of food surrounding an embryo. The living embryo is waiting\r\nfor the right conditions (temperature and moisture) to begin\r\nsprouting. Sprouting means the embryo begins eating up stored food\r\nand making a plant out of it. All foods are damaged by exposure to\r\noxygen, so to protect the embryo's food supply, the seed is\r\nsurrounded by a virtually airtight seed coat that permits only\r\nenough oxygen to enter for the embryo's respiration (yes, seed\r\nbreaths slowly). Often the embryo is located at the edge of the seed\r\nand has its own air intake port. When the seed coat is removed or\r\ndamaged, the innards are exposed to air and begin deteriorating\r\nrapidly. In the case of oats, especially rapidly, because oats are\r\nthe only grass-based cereal that contains large quantities of\r\noil--five percent oil, more or less. That's why oats \"stick to your\r\nribs.\" Rolled oats become stale and lose their flavor (and\r\nnutritional content) and perhaps become rancid very rapidly. So we\r\nmake porridge from whole oat groats that we coarsely grind to grits\r\n(steel-cut oats) in an electric seed/spice mill just before cooking.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to cook oat grits. They take a lot longer than rolled\r\noats and if not done exactly to the recipe I'm about to give you,\r\nwill almost inevitably stick to the pot badly and may also froth\r\nover and mess the stove. Here's how to cook them. Coarsely grind\r\n(like corn meal) your whole oats until you have one cup of oat\r\ngrits. Bring exactly four cups of water (no salt) to a very hard\r\nboil at your highest heat. You may add a handful of raisins. Light\r\nor turn on a second, small-sized burner on the stove and set it as\r\nlow as possible. Into the fast boiling water, slowly pour the ground\r\noats, stirring continuously. Take about 30 seconds to pour it all or\r\nyou'll make clumps. Keep on the high heat until the water again\r\nboils vigorously. Suddenly, the mixture will begin rising in the pot\r\nand will try to pour all over the stove. This means it is all at\r\nboiling temperature again. Quickly move the pot to the low burner;\r\nthat instantly stops the frothing. Then cover. Let the porridge cook\r\nfor 30 minutes, stirring once or twice to prevent sticking. Then,\r\nkeeping it covered, turn off the heat. They can be eaten at this\r\npoint but I think it is better to let the oats finish soaking on the\r\nstove for at least two to four hours. Then reheat in a double\r\nboiler, or warm in a microwave.\r\n\r\nWe usually start a pot of oats at bedtime for the next morning. See\r\nwhy people prefer the convenience of using rolled oats? But once\r\nyou've eaten oats made right, you'll never prefer the flavor of\r\nrolled oats again. And if the human body has any natural method of\r\nassaying nutritional content, it is flavor.\r\n\r\nNutritionally, millet is almost the same story as oats. Millet seed\r\nis protected by a very hard hull. Cooking unhulled millet is almost\r\nimpossible. After hours of boiling the small round seeds will still\r\nbe hard and the hulls remain entirely indigestible. Worse, the\r\nhalf-round hulls (they split eventually) stick in your teeth. But\r\nprehulled millet, sitting in the sack for weeks and months, loses a\r\nlot of nutrition and tastes very second-rate compared to\r\nfreshly-hulled millet. It is possible to buy unhulled millet,\r\nusually by special order from the health food distributor--if you'll\r\ntake a whole sack. Millet can be hulled at home in small batches.\r\nHere's how we figured out how to do it. There probably are better\r\nways.\r\n\r\nUsing a cheap steel-burr flour mill, set the burrs just far enough\r\napart that the seed is ground to grits, but not flour. This pops the\r\nhulls loose. An old mill with worn-out burrs works great for this\r\njob. Then you have to get some hand seed cleaning screens just large\r\nenough to pass the grits but not pass the hulls (most of them).\r\nWindow screen or other hardware cloths won't work. Seed cleaning\r\nscreens come in increments of 1/128 inch; we use a 6/64\" round\r\nscreen. Other batches of millet might work better with a screen one\r\nstep larger or smaller. It will take you a little ingenuity to find\r\nhand-held screens. They're used by seed companies and farmers to\r\nclean small batches of seed for inspection and are usually about one\r\nsquare foot in size with a quality wooden frame. Larger frames made\r\nof the same screening material are used in big seed cleaning\r\nmachines. (The hulls could also be winnowed out by repeatedly\r\npouring the grit/hulls mixture back and forth between two buckets in\r\na gentle breeze.)\r\n\r\nAfter you've screened out most of the hulls, the rest will rinse\r\nout, floating off as you wash the grain prior to cooking. We never\r\nhull more than enough millet for two or three meals and keep the\r\nuncooked (unwashed) millet in the freezer in an airtight jar. It is\r\ninteresting how people will accept poor nutrition and its consequent\r\nsickness as the price of convenience.\r\n\r\nIf you eat much buckwheat you should also figure out how to hull\r\n(sometimes called groating) it yourself. Someone should write a\r\nthorough book on the home milling of cereals. And perhaps sell the\r\nequipment by mail. Probably would be a good little homestead\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nSomething else you need to keep in mind about seed. Even though the\r\nembryo's food supply is protected by the seed coat, it still slowly\r\ndeteriorates, steadily oxidizing and losing nutritional value.\r\nEventually old seed looses the ability to sprout. The decline in\r\ngermination ability matches a decline in nutritional quality. Any\r\nseed you are going to use for eating should possess the ability to\r\nsprout, strongly and rapidly. (After you've comparatively sprouted a\r\nfew grain samples, you'll know what I mean by this.) Fortunately,\r\ncereal grains usually sprout well for quite a few years after\r\nharvest if they have been stored cool and dry. Eating dead or\r\nnear-dead seeds will help move you closer to the same condition\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nFinally, one more warning about buying store bread. Salt-free bread\r\ntastes \"funny\" to most people. It bakes fine, salt is not necessary\r\nto the leavening process, but no bakery could stay in business\r\nwithout salting their bread. The standard level of salt is two\r\npercent by weight. That is quite a lot! Two percent equals one\r\nteaspoonful per pound. I'll have more to say about the evils of salt\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\nI imagine some of my readers are feeling a little overwhelmed by all\r\nthese warnings and \"bewares ofs,\" and intricacies. They are used to\r\ntaking no responsibility for securing their own food supply quality\r\nand have come to expect the \"system\" to protect them. I believe it\r\nis not because of lack of government intervention, but because of\r\ngovernment intervention itself, our food system is very perverse.\r\nUntil our mass consciousness changes, if you wish to make yourself\r\nand your family truly healthy, you are going to have to take charge\r\nand become quite a discriminating shopper. Unconscious consumers are\r\non a rapid road to the total unconsciousness of death.\r\n\r\nAnd again, let me remind you here that this one small book cannot\r\ncontain everything you should know. The bibliography at the end of\r\nshould become your guide to earning your post-graduate education in\r\nnutritional health.\r\n\r\nFreshness Of Fruits And Vegetables\r\n\r\nMost people do not realize the crucial importance of freshness when\r\nit comes to produce. In the same way that seeds gradually die,\r\nfruits and vegetables go through a similar process as their\r\nnutritional content gradually oxidizes or is broken down by the\r\nvegetables own enzymes, but vegetables lose nutrition hundreds of\r\ntimes more rapidly than cereals. Produce was recently part of a\r\nliving plant. It was connected to the vascular system of a plant and\r\nwith few exceptions, is not intended by nature to remain intact\r\nafter being cut. A lettuce or a zucchini was entirely alive at the\r\nmoment of harvest, but from that point, its cells begin to die. Even\r\nif it is not yet attacked by bacteria, molds and fungi, its own\r\ninternal enzymes have begun breaking down its own substances.\r\n\r\nVegetables, especially leafy vegetables, are far more critical in\r\nthis respect than most ripe fruits. All, however, deteriorate much\r\nlike radioactive material; they have a sort of half-life. The\r\nmineral content is stable, but in respect to the vitamins and\r\nenzymes and other complex organic components, each time period or\r\n\"half life\" results in the loss of half the nutrition. Suppose a\r\nlettuce has a half life of 48 hours, two days after harvest only 50\r\npercent of the original nutrition remains. After two more days, half\r\nthe remaining half is gone and only 25 percent is left. After two\r\nmore days half of that 25 percent is lost. Thus six days after\r\nharvest and a lettuce contains only bout 12 percent of its original\r\nnutrition. A two day half-life is only hypothetical. Those types of\r\nproduce I classify as very perishable probably do have a half-life\r\nof from 36 to 48 hours. Moderately perishable produce has a half\r\nlife of about 72 hours; durable types of produce have half lives of\r\n96 hours or longer.\r\n\r\nVegetable Storage Potential\r\n\r\nVery Perishable   Moderately Perishable   Durable\r\nlettuce           zucchini                apple\r\nspinach           eggplant                squash\r\nChinese cabbage   sweet peppers           oranges\r\nkale              broccoli                cabbage\r\nendive            cauliflower             carrot\r\npeaches           apricots                lemons\r\nparsley                                   beets\r\n\r\nThe half life of produce can be lengthened by lowering its\r\ntemperature. For that reason, sophisticated produce growers usually\r\nuse hydrocooling. This process dumps a just-cut vegetable into icy\r\nwater within minutes of being harvested, lowering core temperature\r\nto a few degrees above freezing almost immediately. When cut\r\nvegetables are crated up at field temperatures, and stacks of those\r\ncrates are put in a cooler, it can take the inside of the stack 24\r\nhours, or longer, to become chilled. Home gardeners should also\r\npractice hydrocooling. Fill your sink with cold water and wash/soak\r\nyour harvest until it is thoroughly chilled before draining and\r\nrefrigerating it. Or, harvest your garden early in the morning when\r\ntemperatures are lowest.\r\n\r\nStill, when you buy produce in the store it may have been sitting at\r\nroom temperature for hours or possibly days.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line here: fresh is equally as important as unsprayed or\r\norganically grown!\r\n\r\nThe Real Truth About Salt And Sugar\r\n\r\nFirst, let me remind certain food religionists: salt is salt is salt\r\nis salt and sugar is sugar is sugar. There are no good forms of salt\r\nand no good forms of sugar. Salt from a mine and salt from the sea\r\nboth have the same harmful effect; white sugar, natural brown sugar,\r\nhoney, molasses, corn syrup, maple syrup, whatever sweet have you.\r\nAll are sugars and all have the similar harmful effects. I know of\r\nno harmless salt substitute that really tastes salty. Nutrisweet is\r\nbasically harmless to most people and can be used as a very\r\nsatisfactory replacement for sugars. A few people are unable to\r\ntolerate nutrisweet, causing the anti-chemicalists to circulate much\r\nanti-nutrisweet propaganda, but you should carefully consider this\r\nthought before dismissing nutrisweet--there is almost no food\r\nsubstance that some people are not allergic to or unable to digest.\r\nThe fact that nutrisweet is made in a chemical vat and the fact that\r\nsome cannot handle nutrisweet does not make it \"of the devil.\"\r\n\r\nAnd its not all black and white with the other items either. Sea\r\nsalt does have certain redeeming qualities not found in mined salt\r\nand under certain very special conditions, eating small quantities\r\nof salt may be acceptable. Similarly, some forms of sugar are not\r\nquite as harmful as other forms, though all are harmful.\r\n\r\nThe primary health problem caused by table salt is not that it\r\ncontributes to high blood pressure in people with poor kidneys,\r\nthough it does that. It is not that eating salt ruins the kidneys;\r\nsalt probably does not do that. The real problem with salt is that\r\nsodium chloride is an adrenal stimulant, triggering the release of\r\nadrenal hormones, especially natural steroids that resist\r\ninflammation. When these hormones are at high levels in the blood,\r\nthe person often feels very good, has a sense of well-being. Thus\r\nsalt is a drug! And like many drugs of its type, salt is a\r\nhabituating drug. However, we are so used to whipping our adrenals\r\nwith salt that we don't notice it. What we do notice is that we\r\nthink we like the taste of salted food and consider that food tastes\r\nflat without it. But take away a person's salt shaker and they\r\nbecome very uncomfortable. That's because the addict isn't getting\r\ntheir regular dose.\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong with repetitive adrenal whipping is that adrenal\r\nfortitude is variable; many people's adrenals eventually fail to\r\nrespond to the prod of salt and the body begins to suffer from a\r\nlack of adrenal hormones. Often those inheriting weak adrenals\r\nmanifest semi-failure in childhood. The consequence is that\r\nordinary, irritating substances begin causing severe irritation. The\r\nperson becomes allergic to pollen, dust, foods, animal danders, etc.\r\nWe see asthma, hay fever, sinusitis, etc. Though one can then\r\ndiscover specific allergens and try to remove them from the\r\nenvironment or diet, often this case can be solved far more easily\r\nby complete withdrawal from all salt. This rests the adrenals and\r\nthey may recover their full function; almost certainly their\r\nfunction will improve. The asthma, allergies and etc., gradually\r\nvanish.\r\n\r\nMost of us don't need to eat salt as a nutrient. There's enough\r\nsodium in one dill pickle to run a human body for a year. There's\r\nenough natural sodium in many types of vegetables to supply normal\r\nneeds without using table salt. Perhaps athletes or other hard\r\nworking people in the tropics eating deficient food grown on\r\nleached-out depleted soils, people that sweat buckets day after day\r\nmay need a little extra sodium. Perhaps. Not having practiced in the\r\nhumid tropics myself, I have no definitive answer about this.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the average American is entirely addicted to salt and\r\nthinks food tastes lousy without it. To please the average consumer,\r\nalmost all prepared foods contain far too much salt for someone\r\nsuffering from exhausted adrenals. Interestingly, Canadians do not\r\nlike their foods nearly as salty as Americans, and prepared foods\r\nlike soups and the like in cans and packages that look just like the\r\nones in American supermarkets (though with French on the back panel)\r\nhave to be reformulated for our northern neighbors. I've observed\r\nthat Canadians are generally healthier than Americans in many\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nWe would all be far better off consuming no salt at all. Those with\r\nallergies or asthma should completely eliminate it for a month or\r\ntwo and discover if that simple step doesn't pretty much cure them.\r\nThe trouble is that bakery bread is routinely two percent salt by\r\nweight. Cheese is equally salted or even more so. Canned and frozen\r\nprepared food products are all heavily salted. Restaurant meals are\r\nalways highly salted in the kitchen. If you want to avoid salt you\r\nalmost have to prepare everything yourself, bake your own bread,\r\nabstain from cheese (though there are unsalted cheeses but even I\r\ndon't like the flavor of these), and abstain from restaurants. My\r\nfamily has managed to eliminate all salt from our own kitchen except\r\nfor that in cheese, and we eat cheese rather moderately.\r\n\r\nSugar is a high-caloric non-food with enormous liabilities. First,\r\nfrom the viewpoint of the universal formula for health, no form of\r\nnon-artificial sweetener carries enough nutrients with it to justify\r\nthe number of calories it contains, not even malt extract. White\r\nrefined sugar contains absolutely no nutrients at all; the \"good\" or\r\n\"natural\" sweets also carry so little nutrition as to be next to\r\nuseless. Sweets are so far over on the bad end of the Health =\r\nNutrition / Calories scale that for this reason alone they should be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nHowever, healthy people can usually afford a small amount of sin;\r\nwhy not make it sweets? In small quantity, sugars are probably the\r\neasiest indiscretion to digest and the least damaging to the organ\r\nsystems. Although, speaking of sin, as Edgar Guest, the peoples'\r\npoet, once so wisely quipped, (and my husband agrees) \"Candy is\r\ndandy, but liquor is quicker.\" Sugar is a powerful drug! People who\r\nabuse sweets set up a cycle of addiction that can be very hard to\r\nbreak. It starts when the body tries to regulate blood sugar. Kicked\r\nup to high levels by eating sugar, the pancreas releases insulin.\r\nBut that is not the end of the chain reaction. Insulin regulates\r\nblood sugar levels but also raises brain levels of an amino acid\r\ncalled tryptophan. Tryptophan is the raw material the brain uses to\r\nmanufacture a neurotransmitter called serotonin. And serotonin plays\r\na huge role in regulating mood. Higher brain levels of serotonin\r\ncreate a feeling of well-being. Eating sugar gives a person a\r\nchemical jolt of happiness. Heavy hits of high-glycemic index starch\r\nfoods are also rapidly converted to sugar. So don't give your kids\r\nsweets! Or huge servings of starch to mellow them out. It is wise\r\nnot to start out life a happiness addict with a severe weight\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nNow that the chemistry of sugar addiction is understood, there\r\ncurrently is a movement afoot to cast the obese as helpless victims\r\nof serotonin imbalances and to \"treat\" them with the same kinds of\r\nserotonin-increasing happy drugs (like Prozac) that are becoming so\r\npopular with the psychiatric set. This promises to be a multiple\r\nbillion dollar business that will capture all the money currently\r\nflowing into other dieting systems and bring it right back to the\r\nAMA/drug company/FDA nexus. The pitch is that when serotonin levels\r\nare upped, the desire to eat drops and so is weight. This approach\r\nis popular with the obese because it requires no personal\r\nresponsibility other than taking a pill that really does make them\r\nfeel happy. However, the same benefit can be had by strict adherence\r\nto a low-fat, low-carbohydrate diet. Eventually, the brain chemistry\r\nrebalances itself and serotonin levels stabilize.\r\n\r\nGlycemic Index\r\n\r\n(compared to glucose, which is 100)\r\n\r\nGrains\r\nall bran             51\r\nbrown rice           66\r\nbuckwheat            54\r\ncornflakes           80\r\noatmeal              49\r\nshred. wheat         67\r\nmuesli               66\r\nwhite rice           72\r\nwhite spagetti       50\r\nwhole wheat spagetti 42\r\nsweet corn           59\r\n\r\nFruits\r\napples               39\r\nbananas              62\r\ncherries             23\r\ngrapefruit           26\r\ngrapes               45\r\norange juice         46\r\npeach                29\r\norange               40\r\npear                 34\r\nplum                 25\r\nraisins              64\r\n\r\nVegetables\r\n\r\nbaked beans          40\r\nbeets                64\r\nblack-eyed peas      33\r\ncarrots              92\r\nchic peas            36\r\nparsnips             97\r\npotato chips         51\r\nbaked potato         98\r\nsweet potato         48\r\nyams                 51\r\npeas                 51\r\n\r\nBaked Goods\r\npastry               59\r\nsponge cake          46\r\nwhite bread          69\r\nw/w bread            72\r\nwhole rye bread      42\r\n\r\nSugars\r\nfructose             20\r\nglucose             100\r\nhoney                87\r\nmaltose             110\r\nsucrose              59\r\n\r\nNuts\r\npeanuts              13\r\n\r\nMeats\r\nsausage              28\r\nfish sticks          38\r\n\r\nDairy Products\r\nyogurt               36\r\nwhole milk           34\r\nskim milk            32\r\n\r\nRemember, the pancreas has another major service to perform for the\r\nbody: secreting digestive enzymes to aid in the digestion of\r\nproteins. When the diet contains either too much protein or too much\r\nsugar and/or high-glycemic index starch foods, the overworked\r\npancreas begins to be less and less efficient at maintaining both of\r\nthese functions.\r\n\r\nSometimes a stressed-out pancreas gets overactive and does too good\r\na job lowering the blood sugar, producing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia\r\nis generally accompanied by unpleasant symptoms such as fatigue,\r\ndizziness, blurred vision, irritability, confusion, headache, etc.\r\nThis condition is typically alleviated by yet another hit of sugar\r\nwhich builds an addiction not only to sugar, but to food in general.\r\nIf the hypoglycemic then keeps on eating sugar to relieve the\r\nsymptoms of sugar ingestion, eventually the pancreas becomes\r\nexhausted, producing an insulin deficiency, called diabetes. Medical\r\ndoctors treat diabetes with insulin supplements either oral or\r\nintramuscular plus a careful diet with very low and measured amounts\r\nof sugar and starch for the remainder of the persons inevitably\r\nshortened and far less pleasant life. However, sometimes diabetes\r\ncan be controlled with diet alone, though medical doctors have not\r\nhad nearly as much success with this approach as talented\r\nnaturopaths. Sometimes, long fasting can regenerate a pancreas. It\r\nis far better to avoid creating this disease!\r\n\r\nThe dietary management of hypoglycemia requires that not only\r\nrefined but also unrefined sugars and starches with a high glycemic\r\nindex be removed from the diet. (The glycemic index measures the\r\nease with which the starch is converted into glucose in the body,\r\nand estimates the amount of insulin needed to balance it out.) This\r\nmeans no sugar, no honey, no white flour, no whole grains sweetened\r\nwith honey, no sweet fruits such as watermelons, bananas, raisins,\r\ndates or figs. Potatoes are too readily converted into sugar.\r\nJerusalem artichokes are a good substitute.\r\n\r\nPeople with hypoglycemia can often control their symptoms with\r\nfrequent small meals containing vegetable protein every two hours.\r\nWhen a non-sweet fruit is eaten such as an apple, it should be eaten\r\nwith some almonds or other nut or seed that slows the absorption of\r\nfruit sugar. Hypoglycemics can improve their condition with vitamins\r\nand food supplements. See the next chapter.\r\n\r\nAllergies to foods and environmental irritants are frequently\r\ntriggered by low blood sugar. Mental conditions are also triggered\r\nby low blood sugar levels, frequently contributing to or causing a\r\ncycle of acting out behavior accompanied by destruction of property\r\nand interpersonal violence, as well as psychosis and bouts of\r\ndepression. It is not possible to easily deal with the resulting\r\nbehavior problems unless the hypoglycemia is controlled.\r\nUnfortunately most institutions such as mental hospitals and jails\r\nserve large amounts of sugar and starch and usually caffeinated\r\nbeverages, with a high availability of soda pop, candy, and\r\ncigarettes at concessions. If the diet were drastically improved,\r\nthe drugs given to control behavior in mental hospitals would be\r\nmuch more effective at a lower dose, or unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe insulin-cycle overworked pancreas may eventually not be able to\r\nsecrete enough enzymes to allow for the efficient digestion of foods\r\nhigh in protein. As stated earlier, poor protein digestion leads to\r\na highly toxic condition from putrefied protein in the intestines.\r\nThis condition is alleviated by eliminating animal proteins from the\r\ndiet and taking digestive aids such as pancreatin pills with meals\r\nto assist in the digestion of vegetable proteins.\r\n\r\nFood Combining And \"Healthfood Junkfood.\"\r\n\r\nThis brings us to a topic I call healthfood junkfood. Many people\r\nimprove their diet, eliminating meat and chemicalized food in favor\r\nof whole grains and organically grown foods, but they then proceed\r\nto make these otherwise good foods into virtual junkfood by\r\npreparing them incorrectly. In my travels, I've noticed this same\r\nthing happens everywhere on Earth. What should be health-producing\r\ndietaries are ruined by frying, salting and sugaring.\r\n\r\nHealthfood junkfoods include organically grown potato chips deep\r\nfried in cold pressed organic unsaturated canola oil (made rancid by\r\nfrying) sprinkled with natural sea salt; organically grown oat and\r\nnut granola roasted with cold-pressed unsaturated oil (made rancid\r\nby roasting) hideously sweetened with honey; carrot cake made with\r\nrancid whole wheat flour, cold pressed unsaturated oil (made rancid\r\nby baking), honey, and cream cheese (salted); whole wheat cookies\r\n(stale, rancid flour) sweetened with honey, made with vegetable oil\r\nbaked at high heat (rancid); whole wheat pizza vegetarian style with\r\nlots of soy cheese; whole wheat pizza vegan style with lots of real\r\nraw milk cheese; organically grown corn chips deep fried in cold\r\npressed vegetable oil with or without natural sea salt, yogurts made\r\nfrom powdered milk without an active culture of beneficial bacteria\r\nand covered with highly sugared fruits, etc. These foods may well\r\nrepresent an improvement over the average American diet, but they\r\nstill are not healthy foods, and should never be used in a diet for\r\na sick person. Nor are they worthy of a person attempting to\r\nmaximize health.\r\n\r\nThe problem with healthfood junkfoods is not their major\r\ningredients, but how they were combined and processed and\r\nadulterated. Remember, fats, animal or vegetable, subjected to high\r\nheat become indigestible and toxic and make anything they're cooked\r\nwith indigestible; salt is a toxic drug; cheese, hard enough to\r\ndigest as it is, when raised to high temperatures as it is when\r\nmaking pizza, becomes virtually indigestible and cheese inevitably\r\ncontains a lot of butterfat which, though saturated animal fat, when\r\nraised to high temperatures, still becomes slightly rancid. And all\r\nthese foods represent indigestible combinations.\r\n\r\nMy clients almost never believe me when I first explain the idea of\r\nfood combining. They think if it goes in one end, comes out the\r\nother, and they don't feel any unpleasant symptoms in between, then\r\nit was digested. But bad food combinations have a cumulative\r\ndegenerative effect over a long period of time. When the symptoms\r\narrive the victim never associates the food combination with the\r\nsymptom because it seems to them that they've always been eating the\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nMainstream nutritionists have brainwashed the public into thinking\r\nthat we should have a representative serving from each of the \"four\r\nbasic food groups\" at each and every meal, plus a beverage and a\r\ndesert. Or, as my husband Steve is fond of quipping, a \"balanced\r\nmeal\" has four colors on every plate: something red, something\r\ngreen, something white and something yellow. But the balanced meal\r\nis a gastronomic catastrophe that can only be processed by the very\r\nyoung with high digestive vitality, the exceptionally vital of any\r\nage, people with cast iron stomachs which usually refers to their\r\ngood heredity, and those who are very physically active.\r\n\r\nFew seem to realize that each type of food requires specific and\r\ndifferent digestive enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and intestine.\r\nCarbohydrates, fats, proteins--each requires differing acid or\r\nalkaline environments in order to be digested. Proteins require an\r\nacid environment. Starch digestion requires an alkaline environment.\r\nWhen foods in complex combinations are presented to the stomach all\r\ntogether, like a meal with meat, potatoes, gravy, vegetables, bread,\r\nbutter, a glass of milk, plus a starchy sweet desert, followed by\r\ncoffee or tea, the stomach, pancreas, liver and small intestine are\r\noverwhelmed, resulting in the fermentation of the sugars and\r\nstarches, and the putrefaction of the proteins, and poor digestion\r\nof the whole. It is little wonder that most people feel so tired\r\nafter a large meal and need several cups of strong coffee to be able\r\nto even get up from the table. They have just presented their\r\ndigestive tract with an immensely difficult and for some an\r\nimpossible task.\r\n\r\nFor the most efficient digestion, the body should be presented with\r\none simple food at a time, the one bowl concept, easily achieved by\r\nadherence to the old saying, \"one food at a meal is the ideal.\" An\r\nexample of this approach would be eating fruits for breakfast, a\r\nplain cereal grain for lunch, and vegetables for supper. If you\r\ncan't eat quite that simply, then proper food combining rules should\r\nbe followed to minimize digestive difficulty, maximize the\r\nadsorption of nutrients from your food, and reduce or eliminate the\r\nformation of toxemia, and of course foul gas.\r\n\r\nIn general, fruit should be eaten alone unless you happen to be\r\nhypoglycemic or diabetic in which case fruit should be eaten with\r\nsmall quantities of a vegetable protein such as nuts, or yogurt\r\nand/or cheese if able to digest dairy. Starches should be eaten with\r\nvegetables, which means that a well combined meal would include a\r\ngrain such as rice, millet, buckwheat, amaranth, quinoa, corn,\r\nwheat, rye, oats, spelt, potatoes, or starchy winter squash combined\r\nwith raw or cooked vegetables. Protein foods such as meat, eggs,\r\nbeans, lentils, tofu, split peas, should be combined with\r\nvegetables, raw or cooked. But protein should never be combined with\r\nstarches. The most popular North American snacks and meals always\r\nhave a starch/protein combination, for example: meat and potatoes,\r\nhamburger in a bun, hot dog with bun, burrito with meat or cheese,\r\nmeat sandwiches, etc. It is little wonder that intestinal gas is\r\naccepted as normal, and that over time these hard to digest\r\ncombinations eventually cause health problems that demand attention.\r\n\r\nAnother sure fire way to ruin any food, including the very best\r\navailable is to eat in the presence of negative emotions generated\r\nby yourself or others. Negative emotions include fear, anger,\r\nfrustration, envy, resentment, etc. The digestive tract is\r\nimmediately responsive to stress and or negative thoughts. It\r\nbecomes paralyzed in negative emotional states; any foods eaten are\r\npoorly digested, causing toxemia.\r\n\r\nIt is natural for a person who has lost a loved one or suffered a\r\ngreat loss of any kind to lose their appetite for a period of time.\r\nThis reaction is pro-survival, because while grieving, the body is\r\ngriped by powerful negative emotions. There are people who, under\r\nstress or when experiencing a loss, eat ravenously in an attempt to\r\ncomfort themselves. If this goes on for long the person can expect\r\nto create a serious illness of some kind.\r\n\r\nIndividual sensitivity to this type of overeating is dependent upon\r\ngenetics and personality and who is generating the negative\r\nemotions. Self generated negative emotions are very difficult to\r\navoid. If you are unable to change your own emotional tone or that\r\nof others around you, then it is important to eat very lightly, eat\r\nonly easily digested foods such as raw fruits and vegetables, raw\r\njuices, steamed vegetables, and small servings of whole grains, nuts\r\nand seeds.\r\n\r\nDiets To Heal The Critically Ill\r\n\r\nA critically ill person is someone who could expire at any moment;\r\ntherapeutic interventions are racing against death. Can the body\r\nrepair itself enough before some essential function ceases\r\naltogether? If there already exists too much damage to vital organs\r\nthe person will die. If there remains sufficient organ function to\r\nsupport life, enough vital force to power those functions, and a\r\nwill to live, the body may heal itself if helped by the correct\r\ntherapeutic approach. But the therapy does not do the healing; the\r\nbody does that by itself--if it can. This reality is also true of\r\nallopathic medicine.\r\n\r\nI believe fasting is the therapy that almost invariably gives a\r\ncritically ill person their very best chance of recovery. If a\r\npatient dies while fasting they almost certainly would have died\r\nanyway, and if death comes while fasting, it will be more\r\ncomfortable, with less pain, and with more mental clarity.\r\n\r\nCritically ill people may have, among other things, any of the\r\nfollowing diagnoses: advanced cancer, advanced aids, heart failure,\r\nvery high blood pressure, kidney failure, advanced liver disease,\r\nadvanced emphysema, pneumonia or other catastrophic infections,\r\nespecially those that seem unresponsive to antibiotics, strokes,\r\nemboli, sclerotic vessels as found in arteriosclerosis, severe nerve\r\ndegeneration interfering with nerve transmission to vital organs.\r\n\r\nTreating the critically ill does not have to be an all or nothing,\r\nideological choice between holistic medicine and AMA style medicine.\r\nIt is important for the critically ill and their families to know\r\nthat if they use standard medical treatment such as drugs or\r\nsurgery, these measures can and should be combined with natural\r\nhealing methods. It is always desirable to quit all addicting\r\nsubstances, start a whole foods diet, (as light as possible), and\r\nadd meganutrition (supplements) to the medical doctor's treatments.\r\nFew medical doctors are so arrogantly partisan as to assert that\r\nnatural measures will do any harm as long as the MD is still allowed\r\nto prescribe as they please.\r\n\r\nHolistic support will not only lessen the side effects of the\r\nmedical treatments but will speed up healing and often reduce the\r\nrequired dose of prescribed drugs. I have had several clients with\r\ncancer who chose to have surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, but\r\nstayed on a raw food diet and took high doses of supplements\r\nthroughout the treatment. These people amazed the attending\r\nphysician by feeling good with little if any fatigue, no hair loss,\r\nor flu symptoms. The same can be true of other conditions.\r\n\r\nFood In The Order Of Digestive Difficulty\r\n\r\nIndividual digestive weaknesses and allergies are not taken into\r\naccount in this list.\r\n\r\nHard To Digest: Meat, fish, chicken, eggs (if cooked), all legumes\r\nincluding soy products, peanuts and peanut butter, beans, split\r\npeas, lentils, chick peas, dairy products such as cheese, milk,\r\nbutter milk, nuts and seeds and their butters.\r\n\r\nIntermediate: all grains--quinoa, amaranth, millet, spelt, rye,\r\nwheat, oats, barley.\r\n\r\nFairly Easy: Brussels sprouts, green beans, green peas, broccoli,\r\ncauliflower, raw cultured milk products, asparagus, cabbage, sprouts\r\nespecially bean sprouts, kale, other leafy greens.\r\n\r\nVery Easy: fruits, vegetable juices, fruit juices, broth (clear).\r\n\r\nNo Effort: herb tea, water.\r\n\r\nEthyl always comes to my mind when I think of how much healing power\r\ncan still be left in a dying body. She (accompanied by her husband\r\nfor support) came to Great Oaks School with terminal cancer, heart\r\nfailure, advanced diabetes, extreme weakness, and complete inability\r\nto digest. Any food ingested just came back up immediately. Ethyl\r\nhad large tumors taking over the breast, sticking out from her\r\nskull, and protruding from her body in general. The largest was the\r\none in the left breast which was the size of a big man's fist.\r\n\r\nShe did have one crucial thing going for her, Ethyl was a feisty\r\nIrish red head who still had a will to live, and a reason to do so.\r\nShe and her husband, who had just retired, had dreamed their whole\r\nlife of touring the US and Canada in their own RV the minute he\r\nretired. The time had finally arrived but Ethyl was too ill to\r\nsupport her own weight (only 90 pounds) and to top it off was blind\r\nfrom diabetic retinopathy. The doctors had done everything they\r\ncould to her, and now judged her too weak to withstand any more\r\nsurgery (she had already had her right breast removed). Radiation or\r\nchemotherapy were also considered impossible due to heart failure.\r\nThey sent Ethyl home to die, giving her a few days to a month at\r\nmost.\r\n\r\nAny sensible hygienist trying to stay out of jail would have refused\r\nto take on this type of case because it was a cancer case where\r\ndeath was likely. Treatment of this highly lucrative disease is\r\nconsidered the AMA's exclusive franchise, even when the medical\r\ndoctors have given up after having done everything to a body the\r\nfamily can pay for or owe for. Whenever a person dies under the care\r\nof any person who is not a licensed M.D. there must be an autopsy\r\nand a criminal investigation in search of negligence. If the person\r\ndies under the care of an M.D. the sheriff's assumption is that the\r\ndoctor most assuredly did everything he could and should have done\r\nand death was inevitable. By accepting Ethyl I had a reasonable\r\nlikelihood of ending up in trouble; but being foolish, brave and\r\n(stupidly) feeling relatively immune to such consequences (I was\r\nunder 40 at the time), it seemed important to try to help her. So,\r\nundaunted by the task, regardless of the outcome, I proceeded\r\nlogically, one step at a time. Today, with more experience and a\r\nmodest net worth I wouldn't want to have to defend in a lawsuit, and\r\nat age 55. possessing no spare five to ten years to give to the\r\nState to \"pay\" for my bravery, I would probably refuse such a case.\r\nFortunately I have not been confronted with this problem lately.\r\n\r\nSince Ethyl was unable to digest anything given by mouth, she was\r\nfed rectally with wheat grass juice implants three times a day. She\r\nwas carried to the colonic table for a daily colonic. Wheat grass\r\nand clay poultices were applied to her tumors three times a day. She\r\nreceived an acupressure massage and reflexology treatments during\r\nthe day, plus a lot of tender loving care. This program continued\r\nfor a month during which the tumors were being reabsorbed by the\r\nbody, including the large, extremely hard tumor sticking out the\r\nflesh of the right breast.\r\n\r\nEthyl complained of severe pain as the large tumor in her breast\r\nshrank. While it had been getting larger and pressing ever harder on\r\nall the nerves, she had little or no sensation, but as it shrank,\r\nthe nerves were reactivated. Most people think that a growing tumor\r\nwould cause more pain than a shrinking one. Often the opposite is\r\ntrue. Pain can be a good sign that the body is winning, an indicator\r\nto proceed.\r\n\r\nBy the second month, Ethyl, gradually gaining strength, was able to\r\ntake wheat grass and carrot juice orally, and gradually eased into\r\nraw foods, mostly sprouts and leafy greens such as sunflower and\r\nbuckwheat greens grown in trays. She started to walk with assistance\r\nup and down the halls, no longer experiencing the intense pain\r\nformerly caused by a failing heart, and most surprising of all, her\r\neyesight returned, at first seeing only outlines, and then details.\r\n\r\nThe third month Ethyl enlarged her food intake to include raw foods\r\nas well as the carrot and wheat grass juice and sprouts, plus\r\nvitamin and mineral supplements to help support her immune system\r\nand the healing process. All the tumors had been reabsorbed by her\r\nbody and were no longer visible, her heart was able to support\r\nnormal activity such as walking, and nonstrenuous household chores,\r\nand her diabetes had corrected itself to the point that she no\r\nlonger required insulin and was able to control her blood sugar with\r\ndiet.\r\n\r\nHer husband was then instructed in her maintenance and they went\r\nhome to continue the program. The last I heard from them they had\r\nmade two lengthy trips around the US in their RV and were enjoying\r\ntheir retirement together after all.\r\n\r\nMy treatment worked because the most important factor in the healing\r\nof the critically ill person is not give them more nourishment than\r\ntheir body is able to process. The moment the digestive capacity of\r\nthe sick person is exceeded, the condition will be exacerbated and\r\nin a critically illness, the person is likely to die. If the body\r\nstill has sufficient organ integrity and vital force to heal itself,\r\nit will do so only if given the least possible nourishment that will\r\nsupport life--provided no essential organs are hopelessly damaged. If\r\nthe liver and kidneys are functional, and the person has done some\r\nprevious dietary improvement and/or cleansing, success is likely,\r\nespecially if the person wants to live.\r\n\r\nA person in critical condition does not have time to ease into\r\nfasting by first spending a month or two on a raw foods diet. This\r\nmeans that the person who is taking care of the critically ill\r\nperson must be experienced enough to adjust the intensity of the\r\nbody's healing efforts and accurately assess the ability of the\r\nperson to process toxic waste products clamoring for removal so the\r\nailing body is not drowned in it's own poisons. It is often\r\nnecessary to use clear vegetable broth, vegetable and wheat grass\r\njuices, and fruits juices, or whole sprouts to slow down the\r\ncleansing gradient and sometimes, to resupply the tissue's exhausted\r\nnutritional reserves.\r\n\r\nI wish all cases of critical illness had such a positive outcome as\r\nEthyl's, but unfortunately they don't. I had Marge on the same\r\nprogram at the same time. She also had cancerous tumors all over her\r\nbody and had similarly been sent home to die. In some ways Marge's\r\nbody was a more likely candidate for survival than Ethyl's. Marge\r\ndid not have heart failure or diabetes and was still able on arrival\r\nto at least take small amount of water orally and walk to the\r\nbathroom. Put on a similar program, her tumors also shrunk and were\r\nreabsorbed and she too went home.\r\n\r\nBut Marge did not really have a strong reason to live. Although her\r\nhusband was by her side throughout the treatment program, Marge was\r\ndeeply upset because she was estranged from one of her sons who she\r\nhad not seen for over 10 years. When she went home from Great Oaks,\r\nthe son finally consented to see his mother, went to the effort of\r\ntrying to work things out with her, and finally confessed that under\r\nit all he still loved her.\r\n\r\nAt that point Marge died in peace. She had accomplished the last\r\nthing she wanted to take care of and her will to live did not extend\r\nbeyond that point. Had she died several months earlier as predicted\r\nby the medical profession, Marge would have been unable to resolve\r\nthis relationship. This was what Marge's life was pivoting on at the\r\nend. I was glad to assist her in doing what she needed to do. Her\r\nhusband and other family members found it difficult to understand,\r\nand they were hurt that Marge did not wish to continue her life with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDiet For The Chronically Ill.\r\n\r\nThe chronically ill person has a long-term degenerative condition\r\nthat is not immediately life threatening. This condition usually\r\ncauses more-or-less continuous symptoms that are painful, perhaps\r\nunsightly, and ultimately will be disabling or eventually capable of\r\ncausing death. To qualify as \"chronic\" the symptoms must have been\r\npresent a minimum of six months, with no relief in sight. People\r\nwith these conditions have usually sought medical assistance,\r\nfrequently have had surgery, and have taken and probably are taking\r\nnumerous prescription drugs.\r\n\r\nSome examples of chronic conditions are: arthritis, rheumatism,\r\ndiabetes, early onset of cancer and aids, asthma, colitis,\r\ndiverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, some mental disorders,\r\narterial deposit diseases, most of the itises (inflammations).\r\n\r\nBefore fasting, the chronically ill often do have time to prepare\r\nthe way with limited dietary reform, and frequently begin to feel\r\nrelief quite quickly. Before actually fasting they should limit\r\ntheir diet to raw foods and eliminate all toxic foods like alcohol,\r\ncoffee, tea, salt, sugar and recreational drugs for two months if\r\nthey have been following a typical American diet.\r\n\r\nIf the chronically ill had been following a vegetarian diet, perhaps\r\na diet including with eggs and dairy, if they had been using no\r\naddicting substances, then one month on raw foods is sufficient\r\npreparation for fasting. If the person had water or juice fasted for\r\nat least a week or two within the last two years, and followed a\r\nhealthy diet since that time, one or two weeks on raw foods should\r\nbe a sufficient runway.\r\n\r\nDuring preparation for a fast, I never recommend that a chronically\r\nill person quit taking prescription medicines because doing so can\r\nseriously disrupt their homeostasis. However, if their symptoms\r\nlessen or vanish during the pre-fasting clean up, the person might\r\ntry tapering off medications.\r\n\r\nThe length and type of fast chosen to resolve a chronic illness\r\ndepends largely on available time, finances, availability of support\r\npeople, work responsibilities, and mental toughness. If you are one\r\nof those fortunate people 'rich' enough to give their health first\r\npriority, long water fasting is ideal. If on the other hand you\r\ncan't afford to stop working, have no one to take care of you and\r\nassist with some household chores, and/or you are not mentally tough\r\nenough to deal with self-denial, compromise is necessary.\r\n\r\nIdeally the chronically ill person would fast for an extended period\r\nunder supervision until their symptoms were gone or greatly\r\nimproved, with a fall-back plan to repeat the whole process again in\r\nthree to six months if necessary. If you are not able to do that,\r\nthe next best program is to fast for a short period, like one or two\r\nweeks, with a plan to repeat the process as often as possible until\r\nyou are healed.\r\n\r\nI have had clients with potentially life-threatening conditions such\r\nas obesity with incipient heart failure, or who came to me with\r\ncancer, that were unable to stop work for financial reasons, or who\r\ncould not afford a residential fasting program, or who felt\r\nconfident in their own ability to deal with detoxification in their\r\nown home. These people have fasted successfully at home, coming to\r\nsee me once a week. Almost inevitably, successful at-home fasters\r\nhad already done a lot of research on self healing, believed in it,\r\nand had the personal discipline to carry it out properly, including\r\nbreaking the fast properly without overeating.\r\n\r\nFoods To Heal Chronic Illness\r\n\r\nSprouts     Baby Greens    Salad        Juices     Fruit\r\nalfalfa     sunflower      lettuce      beet       grapefruit\r\nradish      buckwheat      celery       celery     lemon\r\nbean        zucchini       zucchini     lime       lime\r\nclover      kale           kale         orange     orange\r\nfenugreek   endive         radish       parsley    apple\r\nwheat                      tomato       tomato     raspberries\r\ncabbage                    cabbage      cabbage    blueberries\r\n                           carrot       carrot     grapes\r\n                           spinach      apple      peaches\r\n                           parsley      grapefruit apricots\r\n                           sweet pepper lemon      strawberry\r\n\r\nFruits should be watery and lower in sugar. Some examples of poor\r\nfruit choices would be pineapple, ripe mango, bananas, dates,\r\nraisins, figs. Fruits should not be combined with vegetables.\r\n\r\nVegetables should not be starchy, packed-full of energy. Poor\r\nvegetable choices would be potato, parsnip, turnip, corn, sweet\r\npotato, yam, beet, winter squash. Sprouts and baby greens are\r\nvegetables and may be included in salads.\r\n\r\nJuices should not be extremely sweet. Apple, orange, beet and carrot\r\njuice should be diluted with 50% water. Fruit juices should not be\r\nmixed with vegetable juices or with vegetables at the same meal.\r\n\r\nSalads should include no fruit. Salad dressings should be lemon or\r\nlime juice, very small quantities of olive oil, and herbs. No salt,\r\nsoy sauce nor black pepper. Cayenne can be okay for some.\r\n\r\nI have also helped chronically ill people that were not mentally\r\nprepared to water fast, but were able to face the long-term\r\nself-control and deprivation of a raw food cleansing diet that\r\nincluded careful food combining. These people also regained their\r\nhealth, but it took them a year at minimum, and once well they had\r\nto remain on a diet tailor-made to their digestive capacity for the\r\nrest of their life, usually along with food supplements.\r\n\r\nJim was such a case. He was 55 years old, very obese, had\r\ndangerously high blood pressure poorly controlled with medication,\r\nand was going into congestive heart failure. He was on digitalis and\r\nseveral other heart medications plus diuretics, but in no way was\r\nhis condition under control. He had severe edema in the feet and\r\nlegs with pitting, and fluid retention in the abdominal region\r\ncaused a huge paunch that was solid to the touch not soft and\r\nsquishy like fatty tissue.\r\n\r\nJim had dreamed of having his own homestead with an Organic garden,\r\nnow he had these things but was too sick to enjoy them or work in\r\nhis garden without severe heart pain and shortness of breath. Jim\r\nhad retired early in order to enjoy many years without the stresses\r\nof work, and he was alarmed to realize that he was unlikely to\r\nsurvive a year.\r\n\r\nThe day Jim came to see me the first time I would have classified\r\nhis condition as critically ill because his life was in immediate\r\ndanger; but he responded so quickly to his detox program that he was\r\nvery soon out of danger and would be more accurately described as a\r\nchronically ill person. Jim was not prepared to water fast. He was\r\nattached to having his food and he was aware that at his extreme\r\nweight he was going to have stay on a dietary program for a long,\r\nlong time. He also wanted to choose a gradient that he could manage\r\nby himself at home with little assistance from his wife. He had been\r\non a typical American diet with meat, coffee, etc., so that in spite\r\nof his dangerous condition it did not seem wise to me to add the\r\nheavy eliminatory burden of a water fast to a body that was already\r\noverwhelmed with fluids and waste products.\r\n\r\nJim immediately went on a raw food cleansing diet, with no\r\nconcentrated foods like nuts, seeds, or avocados, and with one day\r\neach week fasting on vegetable juice and broth. He did enemas daily\r\neven though it wasn't his favorite thing. In one month he had lost\r\n30 pounds, his eyes had started to sparkle, and his complexion was\r\nrosy. The swelling had disappeared from his feet and legs, and he\r\nhad to buy new pants.\r\n\r\nStarting the second month he gradually withdrew from prescription\r\nmedications. From the beginning I had put Jim on a program of\r\nnutritional supplements including protomorphogens (see chapter on\r\nvitamins and food supplements) to help the body repair it's heart\r\nand the kidneys. In only four months he had returned his body to\r\nglowing health, and looked great for his age, though he was still\r\noverweight. At the end of one year he had returned to a normal\r\nweight for his height, and only cheated on the diet a couple of\r\ntimes when attending a social event, and then it was only a baked\r\npotato with no dressing.\r\n\r\nHe was probably going to have many qualitative years working his\r\ngarden and living out his dreams. The local intensive care ward lost\r\na lot of money when they failed to get Jim.\r\n\r\nDiet For The Acutely Ill\r\n\r\nThe acutely ill person experiences occasional attacks of distressing\r\nsymptoms, usually after indiscretions in living or emotional upsets.\r\nThey have a cold, or a flu, or sinusitis, or a first bout of\r\npneumonia, or a spring allergy attack. The intense symptoms knock\r\nthem flat and force them to bed for a few days or a week. If they\r\nare sick more often than that, they are moving toward the\r\nchronically ill category.\r\n\r\nPeople who are acutely ill should stop eating to whatever extent\r\nthat they are able until the symptoms are gone. During an acute\r\nillness, the appetites is probably pretty dull anyway, so why not\r\ngive a brief fast on water or fruit juice a try.\r\n\r\nMost acute conditions are short in duration, usually not lasting\r\nmore than a week. Allergy attacks, some types of flu, and a first\r\nbout of pneumonia may well last for three weeks or a month. The\r\ngeneral rule is to eat as little as possible until the symptoms have\r\npassed, self-administer colon cleansing, even if you have a horror\r\nof such things, and take vitamin supplements, including megadoses of\r\nVitamin C, bioflavinoids, and zinc. (See the chapter on vitamins.)\r\nThose having a little experience with natural medicine make teas of\r\nechinacea, fenugreek seeds and red clover and quit eating. Eating as\r\nlittle as possible can mean only water and herb teas, only vegetable\r\nbroth, only vegetable juice or non-sweet fruit juice, even only\r\ncleansing raw foods. If you eat more than this you have not relieved\r\nyour system of enough digestive effort.\r\n\r\nAfter your symptoms are gone it is very important to change your\r\nlife-style and improve your diet so that you aren't so toxic and\r\ndon't have to experience an acute illness several times a year when\r\nyour body is forced to try an energetic detox.\r\n\r\nDiet For A Healthy Person\r\n\r\nI doubt that it is possible to be totally healthy in the twentieth\r\ncentury. Doctors Alsleben and Shute in their book How to Survive the\r\nNew Health Catastrophes state that in-depth laboratory testing of\r\nthe population at large demonstrated four universally present\r\npathological conditions: heavy metal poisoning, arteriosclerosis,\r\nsub-clinical infections, and vitamin/mineral deficiencies. Those of\r\nus who consider ourselves healthy, including young people, are not\r\nreally healthy, and at the very least would benefit from nutritional\r\nsupplementation. In fact the odds against most people receiving\r\nadequate vitamin and mineral nutrition without supplements are very\r\npoor as demonstrated by the following chart.\r\n\r\nProblem Nutrients in America\r\n\r\nNutrient     Percent Receiving Less than the RDA\r\nB-6          80%\r\nMagnesium    75\r\nCalcium      68\r\nIron         57\r\nVitamin A    50\r\nB-1          45\r\nC            41\r\nB-2          36\r\nB-12         36\r\nB-3          33\r\n\r\nA genuinely healthy person almost never becomes acutely ill, and\r\ndoes not have any disturbing or distracting symptoms; nothing\r\ninterferes with or handicaps their daily life or work. A healthy\r\nperson has good energy most of the time, a positive state of mind,\r\nrestful sleep, good digestion and elimination.\r\n\r\nHealthy people do not have to live simon-pure lives to remain that\r\nway. Healthy people can afford 10% dietary indiscretions by calorie\r\ncount--eating or drinking those things that they know are not good\r\nfor them but that are fun to eat or are \"recreational foods or\r\nbeverages.\" Such \"sinning\" could mean a restaurant bash twice a\r\nmonth, having a pizza, French bread, beer or wine in moderation, ice\r\ncream, cookies, cake, turkey for festive occasions, etc. The key\r\nconcept of responsible sinning is keeping within that ten percent\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\nA diet for a healthy person that wants to remain healthy should not\r\nexceed the digestive capacity of the individual, either in terms of\r\nquantity or quality. All foods that can not be efficiently digested\r\nshould be removed from the regular diet and relegated to the \"sin\"\r\ncategory, including those you are allergic to and those for which\r\nyou have inadequate digestive enzymes. I have encountered very few\r\npeople that can efficiently digest cooked meat, chicken, or fish,\r\nbut some can, and some can with the assistance of digestive enzyme\r\nsupplements. In order to digest meats, the stomach must be\r\nsufficiently acid, there must be enough pepsin, pancreatin, and\r\nbile, etc., and the meat should be eaten on the extremely rare side\r\n(not pork), in small quantities (not more than five or six ounces),\r\nand not combined with anything except nonstarchy vegetables. If you\r\nmust include meat in your dietary, it should represent a very small\r\npercentage of your total caloric intake, be eaten infrequently, with\r\nthe bulk of the calories coming from complex carbohydrates such\r\ngrains, legumes and nuts, as well as large quantities of vegetables\r\nand fruits.\r\n\r\nThe healthy person that wants to stay that way for many, years is\r\nadvised to fast one day a week, to give the organs of elimination a\r\nchance to catch up on their internal housecleaning. If water fasting\r\nseems impossible, try a day of juicing it; if that is too rigorous,\r\ntry a day on raw foods. A similar technique, though less beneficial\r\nthan even a one day each week on raw foods, is delaying breaking\r\nyour overnight fast for as long as possible each day. Try giving up\r\nbreakfast altogether or postponing breaking your overnight fast,\r\nbecause from the time you stop eating at the end of one day to the\r\ntime you start eating the next is actually a brief, detoxifying\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nEggs, milk, cheese and yogurt can be assimilated by some healthy\r\npeople with or without digestive aids. It is possible to take\r\nlactase to break down the milk sugars for example; sometimes aids\r\nsuch as hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and pancreatin help. If you can\r\nbuy it or are willing to make it raw milk yogurt containing\r\nlactobacillus bulgaris or acidophilus may be digested more readily,\r\nespecially if it prepared from healthy cows or goats fed on\r\nunsprayed food, and served very fresh. Eggs should come from\r\nchickens that run around outside, eating weeds, and scratching bugs.\r\nThe yokes of those eggs will be intense orange, not yellow. Few\r\npeople these days have ever eaten a real egg. Surprisingly, for\r\nthose of you who fear cholesterol, the healthy way to eat eggs is\r\nuse just the raw yolk from fertile eggs. It is enjoyed by many\r\npeople in a smoothie--fresh fruit blended up with water or milk. Eggs\r\ncontain lecithin, a nutrient that naturally prevents the body from\r\nforming harmful fatty deposits in the arteries.\r\n\r\nSea weeds are a wonderful source of minerals and should be eaten in\r\nsoups and salads. Other invaluable fortifying foods are algae of all\r\nkinds (such as chlorella and spirulina), lecithin, brewers yeast,\r\nand fresh bakers yeast. Many people have had very unpleasant\r\nexperiences trying to eat living bakers yeast and so use brewers\r\nyeast instead. But brewers yeast is cooked and the proteins it\r\ncontains are not nearly as assimilable as those in raw yeast. Raw\r\nyeast is so powerful, it feels like pep pills!\r\n\r\nIt takes a special technique to eat raw yeast because in the stomach\r\nand intestines the yeast does the job it is supposed to do: convert\r\nsugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas. The entire digestive\r\ntract then bloats with gas and the person will feel very\r\nuncomfortable for some time. However, raw yeast is a marvelous\r\nsource of B vitamins and proteins and can make someone feel very\r\nenergetic--if they know how to use it. The secret is to eat live\r\nyeast very first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and then,\r\nnot eat anything at all for about two hours, giving the stomach\r\nacids and enzymes time to kill the yeasts and digest them before\r\nadding sugars from another meal. Some like to eat yeast in fresh\r\ncake form, buying it from a bakery. Others prefer dry granular\r\nbaker's yeast blended with water into a sort of \"shake.\" This is not\r\na bad place to put your raw egg yoke either. If you need it\r\nsweetened to drink it, use an artificial or herbal sweetener like\r\nnutrisweet or stevia. Live yeast cannot consume milk sugars very\r\nwell. So if you can handle dairy, try one or two tablespoons of\r\ngranulated live yeast, an egg yoke and a little raw milk or yogurt,\r\nwell whizzed.\r\n\r\nWheat germ is also a great, rich food, but is usually rancid unless\r\nit is taken out of the refrigerated display; unless it is\r\nrefrigerated, in a dated package and fresh, don't eat it. Herb teas\r\nand roasted grain beverages are healthy beverages, along with\r\nmineral and distilled water avoiding where possible chlorinated and\r\nfluoridated water.\r\n\r\nDiet Is Not Enough\r\n\r\nThose isolated, long-lived peoples discovered by Weston A. Price had\r\nto do hard physical labor to eat, had to walk briskly up and down\r\nsteep terrain to get anywhere. But today, few North Americans output\r\nvery much physical energy in process of daily life or work. Not only\r\ncars, but all of our modern conveniences make it possible to live\r\nwithout ever breaking into a sweat. We pay for this ease; it costs\r\nus a significant degree of health.\r\n\r\nExercise has many benefits when combined with excellent nutrition.\r\nIt creates an overall feeling of well-being that can not be created\r\nby diet alone. Exercising temporarily makes the heart beat faster,\r\nincreasing blood circulation throughout the body right out to the\r\ntips of your fingers and toes. This short-term elevated flow of\r\nblood flow brings increased supplies of oxygen and nutrients to all\r\nparts of the body, facilitating healing and repair. Without revving\r\nup your engine every day many of the body's systems never get the\r\nsludge burned out of them and never perform optimally.\r\n\r\nExercise also changes the metabolic rate so your body burns more\r\ncalories--not only while you are exercising, but also for a 24 hour\r\nperiod following exercise. This maintains a healthful body weight\r\ninto old age, or helps to lose weight. Most people find that\r\nexercise in moderation does not increase appetite, so that it is\r\npossible to consistently burn more calories in a day, and gradually\r\nreduce weight if that is desirable. It is necessary to burn 3,500\r\ncalories to lose a pound of weight. Most forms of exercise allow you\r\nto burn 300 to 600 calories per hour at a moderate pace which would\r\nbe achieved by doubling the resting pulse. Without even considering\r\nthe weight-loss benefit of achieving a raised metabolism, an hour of\r\ndaily exercise continued for a week or two dependent upon the type\r\nof exercise and pace should lead to one pound of weight loss if the\r\ncaloric intake is held constant.\r\n\r\nThe flip side of having a higher metabolism is rarely appreciated\r\nbut is extremely important. Recall the basic equation of health:\r\nHealth = Nutrition / Calories. Exercise permits a person to eat\r\nsomewhat more while not gaining weight. If the food is nutrient\r\nrich, the body has a chance to extract more vitamins, more minerals,\r\nmore amino acids. The person who remains slender by rigidly reducing\r\ntheir food intake to near starvation levels may lack vital,\r\nhealth-building nutrition.\r\n\r\nAnd only exercise moves lymphatic fluid. The blood is pumped through\r\nthe body by the heart, but the lymphatic system, lacking a heart,\r\nrequires muscular contractions to move from the extremities of the\r\nbody to the central cavity. The lymphatic system picks up cellular\r\nwaste products and conducts these toxins to disposal. Frequently,\r\npeople with rheumatic aches and pains or other generalized muscular\r\ndiscomforts physicians like to give Latin diagnostic names to can\r\ngive up taking pain pills if they will but begin exercising\r\nregularly. Only when they begin moving their lymph can they begin to\r\ndetoxify properly.\r\n\r\nThere is another benefit from exercise which is not to be ignored,\r\nand that is that it gives the person a chemical sense of well being.\r\nIt actually will help to emotionally boost up people who are\r\nchronically depressed and make them smile. After a good workout,\r\nespecially one done outside, everything seems brighter, more\r\npositive; whatever was bothering you somehow just doesn't seem like\r\nthat big of a deal now. I am not making pro-exercise propaganda.\r\nThis is not a figment of the imagination. An exercising body really\r\ndoes make antidepressant neurochemicals called endorphins, but only\r\nafter about 45 minutes to an hour of aerobic workout.\r\n\r\nEndorphins are powerful, with painkilling and euphoric effects equal\r\nto or greater than heroin, but without any undesirable side effects.\r\nIf chemists could learn to cheaply synthesize endorphins I'm sure\r\nthat millions of people would want to become addicted to them.\r\nBecause I make such a point of getting in my workout every day, my\r\nhusband has accused me of being an endorphin junkie, and he is\r\nright! I admit it, I'm really hooked on the feeling of well being I\r\nconsistently get from any sustained exercise. I defend my addiction\r\nstaunchly because it is the healthiest addiction I know of.\r\n\r\nI have also been accused of carrying exercise to extremes, and I\r\nadmit to that also. For a few years I trained for Ironman\r\ntriathlons. I now think doing ironman distances is immoderate and\r\nexcept for a few remarkable individuals with \"iron\" constitutions,\r\ntraining that hard can only lead to a form of exhaustion that is not\r\nhealth promoting. I have become much more sensible in my \"old\" age,\r\nand in recent years have limited my participation to the Olympic\r\ndistance triathlons. I was on the Canadian team at the World\r\nChampionship in 1992, and intend to do it again in 1995. I do not\r\nfind the Olympic distance exhausting, in fact I think it is great\r\nfun and truly exhilarating. I get to see all these wonderful age\r\ngroup competitors from all over the world who look and feel\r\nfantastic. It does my soul good to see a group of people aging so\r\ngracefully, not buying into the popular notion that old age is\r\ninevitably disabling, depressing, and ugly. Sport brings a degree of\r\nbalance to my life after spending so much time in the presence of\r\nthe sick. I plan to maintain my athletic activities into old age,\r\nbarring accident or other unforeseen obstacles to fitness.\r\n\r\nTo maintain basic fitness it does not matter so much what form of\r\nexercise is chosen, as long as it is not damaging to the skeletal\r\nsystem or connective tissues. Many people are unable to run due to\r\nfoot, knee, hip, or back problems, but almost everyone can walk.\r\nWalking outside is better than inside on a treadmill, and walking\r\nhills is better than walking on flat ground. Exercise machines such\r\nas stationary bikes, cross country ski machines, and stair steppers\r\nwork well for a lot of people who live in the city, especially in\r\nthe winter, or for those who hate exercise. Whatever you choose to\r\ndo, it is important to at least double the resting pulse for 30\r\nminutes no less than four days a week. This is the absolute minimum\r\nrequired to maintain the health and function of the\r\ncardiovascular-pulmonary system. If your resting pulse is 70, you\r\nmust walk, jog, ski, bike, swim or what have you, fast enough to\r\nkeep the pulse at 140 beats per minute for at least 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nI have a strong preference to exercising outside in isolated places\r\nwhere there is only me and the forest, or only me and the river.\r\nRunning along logging roads in the hilly back country, or swimming\r\nin the green unpolluted water of a forest river is a spiritual\r\nexperience for me. It is a time to meditate, to commune with nature,\r\nand to clear my mind and create new solutions. The repetitive action\r\nof running or walking or swimming, along with the regular deep\r\nbreathing in clean air, with no distractions except what nature\r\nprovides is truly health promoting. Sharing these activities with\r\nfriends or family can also be great fun and some of the best in\r\nsocial interactions. It is one of my favorite ways of visiting with\r\npeople. I don't expect other people to be as enthusiastic about\r\nexercise as I am, but I do hope that everyone will make an effort to\r\nbe minimally fit as an ongoing part of their health program into old\r\nage.\r\n\r\nDiet For A Long, Long Life\r\n\r\nSome people not only want to be healthy, but they want to live in\r\ngood health long past the normal life span projected by statistical\r\ntables for Homo Sapiens. Dr. Roy Walford, a well-respected medical\r\nresearch gerontologist who has been actively studying longevity for\r\nmany years, is one of those. He has scientifically demonstrated with\r\naccepted studies that a qualitative life span up to at least 115\r\nyears of age is reasonably attainable by the average person if they\r\nstart working on it no later than about 50 years of age, though\r\nearlier is much better.\r\n\r\nWalford's principles of extending life are very simple. All you have\r\nto do is restrict your caloric intake to about 1,500 per day, and\r\nwater fast two days a week. Or alternatively, reduce your caloric\r\nintake to 1,200 per day and fast only one day a week on water. And\r\nmake sure that every single bit of food you do eat is packed with\r\nnutrition, every single calorie, without exception. You continue\r\nthis program for the rest of your life along with moderate daily\r\nexercise and high but reasonable dosages of vitamins, minerals, and\r\nalso take a few exotic food supplements. The supplement program is\r\nnot particularly expensive nor extreme, Walford's supplement program\r\nis more moderate than the life extension program I recommend for all\r\nmiddle-aged and older people. The best foods for this type of\r\nprogram is a largely raw food diet (80%) with a predominance of\r\nsprouts and baby greens, some cooked vegetables, and raw nuts and\r\nseeds. And make sure you get 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise\r\nevery other day.\r\n\r\nWhile Dr. Walford's focus is on caloric reduction while maintaining\r\nsufficient nutrition, most other life extensionists focus on\r\nincreasing the nutrition side of the equation for health without\r\nbothering to reduce caloric intake. This approach is much easier\r\nbecause essentially, it involves gobbling nutritional supplements by\r\nthe handfuls without requiring self-discipline, though it can get\r\nquite expensive. I'll have more to say about this approach in the\r\nnext chapter, which is about vitamins.\r\n\r\nIn this book I can't explain all the aspects of prolongation of life\r\nthrough conscious life-style choice. Those who are interested are\r\nreferred to the Bibliography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Six\r\n\r\nVitamins and Other Food Supplements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom The Hygienic Dictionary\r\n\r\nVitamins. [1] The staple foods may not contain the same nutritive\r\nsubstances as in former times. . . . Chemical fertilizers, by\r\nincreasing the abundance of the crops without replacing all the\r\nexhausted elements of the soil, may have indirectly contributed to\r\nchange the nutritive value of cereal grains and of vegetables. . . .\r\nHygienists have not paid sufficient attention to the genesis of\r\ndiseases. Their studies of conditions of life and diet, and of their\r\neffects on the physiological and mental state of modern man are\r\nsuperficial, incomplete, and of too short duration. They have, thus,\r\ncontributed to the weakening of our body and our soul. _Alexis\r\nCarrel, Man the Unknown._\r\n\r\nI have already explained the hygienist's view of why people get\r\nsick. The sequence of causation goes: enervation, toxemia,\r\nalternative elimination, disease. However, there is one more link in\r\nthis chain, a precursor to enervation that, for good and\r\nunderstandable reasons, seemed unknown to the earlier hygienists.\r\nThat precursor is long term sub-clinical malnutrition. Lack of\r\nnutrition effects virtually everybody today. Almost all of us are\r\noverfed but undernourished.\r\n\r\nI have already explained that one particular head of broccoli does\r\nnot necessarily equal another head of broccoli; the nutritional\r\ncomposition of apparently identical foods can be highly variable.\r\nNot only do different samples of the same type of food differ wildly\r\nin protein content, amino acid ratios and mineral content, their\r\nvitamin and vitamin-like substances also vary according to soil\r\nfertility and the variety grown.\r\n\r\nThese days, food crop varieties are bred for yield and other\r\ncommercial considerations, such as shipability, storage life, and\r\nease of processing. In pre-industrial times when each family\r\npropagated its own unique open-pollinated varieties, a natural\r\nselection process for healthy outcomes prevailed. If the family's\r\nparticular, unique varieties carried genes for highly nutritious\r\nfood, and if the family's land was fertile enough to allow those\r\ngenes to manifest, and if the family kept up its land's fertility by\r\nwise management, their children tended to survive the gauntlet of\r\nchildhood illness and lived to propagate the family's varieties and\r\ncontinue the family name. Thus, over time, human food cultivars were\r\nselected for their nutritional content.\r\n\r\nBut not any longer! These days, farming technology with its focus on\r\nbulk yield and profit, degrades the nutritional content of our\r\nentire food supply. Even commercial organically grown food is no\r\nbetter in this respect.\r\n\r\nSub-clinical, life-long, vitamin and mineral deficiencies contribute\r\nto the onset of disease; the malnourished body becomes increasingly\r\nenervated, beginning the process of disease. Vitamin supplements can\r\nincrease the body's vital force, reversing to a degree the natural\r\ntendency towards degeneration. In fact, some medical gerontologists\r\ntheorize that by using vitamins it might be possible to restore\r\nhuman life span to its genetically programmed 115 years without\r\ndoing anything else about increasing nutrition from our degraded\r\nfoods or paying much attention to dietary indiscretions. Knowing\r\nwhat I do about toxemia's effects I doubt vitamins can allow us to\r\ntotally ignore what we eat, though supplements can certainly help.\r\n\r\nMore than degraded nutritional content of food prompts a thinking\r\nperson to use food supplements. Our bodies and spirits are\r\nconstantly assaulted and insulted by modern life in ways our\r\ngenetics never intended us to deal with. Today the entire\r\nenvironment is mildly toxic. Air is polluted; water is polluted; our\r\nfood supply contains traces of highly poisonous artificial molecules\r\nthat our bodies have no natural ability to process and eliminate.\r\nOur cities and work places are full of loud, shocking noises that\r\ntrigger frequent adrenaline rushes and other stress adaptations. Our\r\nwork places are full of psychological stresses that humans never had\r\nto deal with before.\r\n\r\nHistorically, humans who were not enslaved have been in control of\r\ndetermining their own hour to hour, day to day activities, living on\r\ntheir own largely self-sufficient farms. The idea of working for\r\nanother, at regular hours, without personal liberty, ignoring or\r\nsuppressing one's own agenda and inclinations over an entire\r\nlifetime is quite new and not at all healthy. It takes continual\r\nsubconscious applications of mental and psychic energies to protect\r\nourselves against the stresses of modern life, energies that we\r\ndon't know we're expending. This is also highly enervating. Thus to\r\nremain healthy we may need nutrition at levels far higher than might\r\nbe possible through eating food; even ideal food might not contain\r\nenough vitamins to sustain us against the strains and stresses of\r\nthis century.\r\n\r\nAnd think about Dr. Pottenger's cats. Our bodies are at the poorer\r\nend of a century-long process of mass degeneration that started with\r\nwhite flour from the roller mill. Compared to my older clients I\r\nhave noticed that my younger patients seem to possess less vital\r\nforce on the average, show evidence of poorer skeletal development,\r\nhave poorer teeth, less energy, have far more difficulty breeding\r\nand coping with their family life, and are far more likely to\r\ndevelop degenerative conditions early. Most of my younger patients\r\nhad a poor start because they were raised on highly refined,\r\ndevitalized, deficient foods, and grew up without much exercise.\r\nTheir parents had somewhat better food. Some of their grandparents\r\nmay have even grown up on raw milk and a vegetable garden, and\r\nactually had to walk, not owning cars when they were young. Their\r\ngreat grandparents had a high likelihood of enjoying decent\r\nnutrition and a healthful life-style.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most of my patients like the idea of taking vitamins\r\ntoo much for their own good. The AMA medical model has conditioned\r\npeople to swallow something for every little discomfort, and taking\r\na pill is also by far the easiest thing to do because a pill\r\nrequires no life-style changes, nor self-discipline, nor personal\r\nresponsibility. But vitamins are much more frugal than drugs.\r\nCompared to prescriptions, even the most exotic life extension\r\nsupplements are much less expensive. I am saddened when my clients\r\ntell me they can't afford supplements. When their MD prescribes a\r\nmedicine that costs many times more they never have trouble finding\r\nthe money.\r\n\r\nI am also saddened that people are so willing to take supplements,\r\nbecause I can usually do a lot more to genuinely help their bodies\r\nheal with dietary modification and detoxification. Of all the tools\r\nat my disposal that help people heal, last in the race comes\r\nsupplements.\r\n\r\nOne of the best aspects of using vitamins as though they were\r\nhealing agents is that food supplements almost never have harmful\r\nside effects, even when they are taken in what might seem enormous\r\noverdoses. If someone with a health condition reads or hears about\r\nsome vitamin being curative, goes out and buys some and takes it,\r\nthey will at very least have followed the basic principle of good\r\nmedicine: first of all do no harm. At worst, if the supplements did\r\nnothing for them at all, they are practicing the same kind of\r\nbenevolent medicine that Dr. Jennings did almost two centuries ago.\r\nNot only that, but having done something to treat their symptoms,\r\nthey have become patients facilitating their own patience, giving\r\ntheir body a chance to correct its problem. They well may get\r\nbetter, but not because of the action of the particular vitamin they\r\ntook. Or, luckily, the vitamin or vitamins they take may have been\r\njust what was needed, raising their body's vital force and\r\naccelerating the body's ability to solve its problem.\r\n\r\nOne reason vitamin therapies frequently do not work as well as they\r\nmight is that, having been intimidated by AMA propaganda that has\r\ncreated largely false fears in the public mind about harmful effects\r\nof vitamin overdoses, the person may not take enough of the right\r\nvitamin. The minimum daily requirements of vitamins and minerals as\r\noutlined in nutrition texts are only sufficient to prevent the most\r\nobvious forms of deficiency diseases. If a person takes supplements\r\nat or near the minimum daily requirement (the dose recommended by\r\nthe FDA as being 'generally recognized as safe') they should not\r\nexpect to see any therapeutic effect unless they have scurvy, beri\r\nberi, rickets, goiter, or pellagra.\r\n\r\nIn these days of vitamin-fortified bread and iodized salt, and even\r\nvitamin C fortified soft drinks, you almost never see the kind of\r\nlife-threatening deficiency states people first learned to\r\nrecognize, such as scurvy. Sailors on long sea voyages used to\r\ndevelop a debilitating form of vitamin C deficiency that could kill.\r\nScurvy could be quickly cured by as little as one lime a day. For\r\nthis reason the British Government legislated the carrying of limes\r\non long voyages and today that is why British sailors are still\r\ncalled limeys. A lime has less than 30 milligrams of vitamin C. But\r\nto make a cold clear up faster with vitamin C a mere 30 mg does\r\nabsolutely nothing! To begin to dent an infection with vitamin C\r\ntakes 10,000 milligrams a day, and to make a life threatening\r\ninfection like pneumonia go away faster might require 25,000 to\r\n150,000 milligrams of vitamin C daily, administered intravenously.\r\nIn terms of supplying that much C with limes, that's 300 to 750 of\r\nthem daily--clearly impossible.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, pellagra can be cured with a few milligrams of vitamin\r\nB3, but schizophrenia can sometimes be cured with 3,000 milligrams,\r\nroughly a thousand times as much as the MDR.\r\n\r\nThere are many many common diseases that the medical profession does\r\nnot see as being caused by vitamin deficiencies. Senility and many\r\nmental disorders fall in this category. Many old people live on\r\nextremely deficient diets comprised largely of devitalized starches,\r\nsugars, and fats, partly because many do not have good enough teeth\r\nto chew vegetables and other high roughage foods, and they do not\r\nhave the energy it takes to prepare more nourishing foods. Virtually\r\nall old people have deficiency diseases. As vital force inevitably\r\ndeclines with age, the quantity and quality of digestive enzymes\r\ndecreases, then the ability to breakdown and extract soluble\r\nnutrients from food is diminished, frequently leading to serious\r\ndeficiencies. These deficiencies are inevitably misdiagnosed as\r\ndisease and as aging.\r\n\r\nSuppose a body needs 30 milligrams a day of niacin to not develop\r\npellagra, but to be fully healthy, needs 500 milligrams daily. If\r\nthat body receives 50 milligrams per day from a vitamin pill, to the\r\nmedical doctor it could not possibly be deficient in this vitamin.\r\nHowever, over time, the insidious sub-clinical deficiency may\r\ndegrade some other system and produce a different disease, such as\r\ncolitis. But the medical doctor sees no relationship. Let me give\r\nyou an actual example. Medical researchers studying vitamin B5 or\r\npantothenic acid noticed that it could, in what seemed to be\r\nmegadoses (compared to the minimum daily requirement) largely\r\nreverse certain degenerative effects of aging. These researchers\r\nwere measuring endurance in rats as it decreased through the aging\r\nprocess. How they made this measurement may appear to some readers\r\nto be heartless, but the best way to gauge the endurance of a rat is\r\nto toss it into a five gallon bucket of cold water and see how long\r\nit swims before it drowns. Under these conditions, the researcher\r\ncan be absolutely confident that the rat does its very best to stay\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nYoung healthy rats can swim for 45 minutes in 50 degree Fahrenheit\r\nwater before drowning. Old rats can only last about 15 minutes. And\r\nold rats swim differently, less efficiently, with their lower bodies\r\nmore or less vertical, sort of dog paddling. But when old rats were\r\nfed pantothenic acid at a very high dose for a few weeks before the\r\ntest, they swam 45 minutes too. And swam more efficiently, like the\r\nyoung rats did. More interestingly, their coats changed color (the\r\ngray went away) and improved in texture; they began to appear like\r\nyoung rats. And the rats on megadoses of B5 lived lot longer--25 to\r\n33 percent longer than rats not on large doses of B5. Does that mean\r\n\"megadoses\" of B5 have an unknown drug-like effect? Or does that\r\nmean the real nutritional requirement for B5 is a lot higher than\r\nmost people think? I believe the second choice is correct. To give\r\nyou an idea of how much B5 the old rats were given in human terms,\r\nthe FDA says the minimum daily requirement for B5 is about 10\r\nmilligrams but if humans took as much B5 as the rats, they would\r\ntake about 750 milligrams per day. Incidentally, I figure I am as\r\nworthy as any lab rat and take over 500 milligrams daily.\r\n\r\nMy point is that there is a big difference between preventing a\r\ngross vitamin deficiency disease, and using vitamins to create\r\noptimum functioning. Any sick person or anyone with a health\r\ncomplaint needs to improve their overall functioning in any way that\r\nwon't be harmful over the long term. Vitamin therapy can be an\r\namazingly effective adjunct to dietary reform and detoxification.\r\n\r\nSome of the earlier natural hygienists were opposed to using\r\nvitamins. However, these doctors lived in an era when the food\r\nsupply was better, when mass human degeneration had not proceeded as\r\nfar as it has today. From their perspective, it was possible to\r\nobtain all the nutrition one needed from food. In our time this is\r\nunlikely unless a person knowingly and intelligently produces\r\nvirtually all their own food on a highly fertile soil body whose\r\nfertility is maintained and adjusted with a conscious intent to\r\nmaximize the nutritive content of the food. Unfortunately, ignorance\r\nof the degraded nature of industrial food seems to extend to\r\notherwise admirable natural healing methods such as Macrobiotics and\r\nhomeopathy because these disciplines also downplay any need for food\r\nsupplementation.\r\n\r\nVitamins For Young Persons And Children\r\n\r\nYoung healthy people from weaning through their thirties should also\r\ntake nutritional supplements even though young people usually feel\r\nso good that they find it impossible to conceive that anything could\r\nharm them or that they ever could become seriously sick or actually\r\ndie. I know this is true because I remember my own youth and\r\nbesides, why else would young people so glibly ride motorcycles or,\r\nafter only a few months of brainwashing, charge up a hill into the\r\nbarrel of a machine gun. Or have unsafe sex in this age of multiple\r\nvenereal diseases. Until they get a little sense, vitamin\r\nsupplements help to counteract their inevitable and unpreventable\r\nuse of recreational foods. Vitamins are the cheapest long life and\r\nhealth insurance plan now available. Parents are generally very\r\nsurprised at the thought that even their children need nutritional\r\nsupplements; very few healthy children receive them. A few are given\r\nextra vitamin C when acutely ill, when they have colds or\r\ncommunicable diseases such as chicken pox.\r\n\r\nYoung people require a low dose supplement compared to those of us\r\nmiddle-aged or older, but it should be a broad formula with the full\r\nrange of vitamins and minerals. Some of the best products I have\r\nfound over 25 years of research and experimentation with young\r\npeople are Douglas Cooper's \"Basic Formula\" (low dose and excellent\r\nfor children) and \"Super T Formula\" (double the dose of Basic\r\nFormula, therefore better for adolescents and young adults), also\r\nfrom Douglas Cooper Company; Bronson's \"Vitamin and Mineral Formula\r\nfor Active Men and Women\" and Bronson's \"Insurance Formula.\"\r\n\"Vitamin 75 Plus;\" and \"Formula 2\" from Now Natural Foods are also\r\ngood and less costly.\r\n\r\nHealthy very small children who will swallow pills can take these\r\nsame products at half the recommended dose. If they won't swallow\r\npills the pills can be blended into a fruit smoothie or finely\r\ncrushed and then stirred into apple sauce. There are also\r\n\"Children's Chewable Multi-Vitamins + Iron\" (1-5 years old) from\r\nDouglas Cooper that contains no minerals except iron, Bronson's\r\n\"Chewable Vitamins\" (make sure it is the one for small children,\r\nBronson makes several types of chewables) and a liquid vitamin\r\nproduct from Bronson called Multivitamin Drops for Infants. These\r\nwill be a little more costly than cutting pills in half.\r\n\r\nThere is also an extraordinarily high quality multivitamin/mineral\r\nformula for children called \"Children's Formula Life Extension Mix\"\r\nfrom Prolongevity, Ltd. (the Life Extension Foundation), it is in\r\ntablet form, and slightly more expensive.\r\n\r\nI hope that my book will be around for several generations. The\r\nbusinesses whose vitamin products I recommend will not likely exist\r\nin twenty years. Even sooner than that the product names and details\r\nof the formulations will almost certainly be altered. So, for future\r\nreaders discovering this book in a library or dusty shelve of a used\r\nbook store, if I, at my current level of understanding, were\r\nmanufacturing a childrens and young adults vitamin formula myself,\r\nthis is what it would contain. Any commercial formulation within 25\r\npercent of these figures plus or minus would probably be fine as\r\nlong as the vitamins in the pills were of high quality.\r\n\r\nVitamin C   500 mg  B-1              30 mg\r\nVitamin E   50 iu   B-2              30 mg\r\nVitamin A   500 iu  B-3 niacinamide  100 mg\r\nVitamin D   25 iu   B-5              50 mg\r\nMagnesium   100 mg  B-6              30 mg\r\nCalcium     400 mg  B-12             30 mcg\r\nSelenium    10 mcg  Chromium         20 mcg\r\nManganese   2 mcg   Biotin           30 mg\r\nZinc        5 mg    Iodine (as kelp) 5 mg\r\nPABA        20 mg   Bioflavinoids    100 mg\r\n\r\nVitamins For An Older Healthy Person\r\n\r\nSomeone who is beyond 35 to 40 years of age should still feel good\r\nalmost all of the time. That is how life should be. But enjoying\r\nwell-being does not mean that no dietary supplementation is called\r\nfor. The onset of middle age is the appropriate time to begin\r\nworking on continuing to feel well for as long as possible. Just\r\nlike a car, if you take very good care of it from the beginning, it\r\nis likely to run smoothly for many years into the future. If on the\r\nother hand you drive it hard and fast with a lot of deferred\r\nmaintenance you will probably have to trade it in on a new one after\r\na very few years. Most people in their 70s and older who are\r\nstruggling with many uncomfortable symptoms and low energy lament,\r\n'if I'd only known I was going to live so long I would have taken\r\nbetter care of myself.' But at that point it is too late for the old\r\ndonkey; time for a trade in.\r\n\r\nGerontologists refer to combating the aging process as \"squaring the\r\ncurve.\" We arrive at the peak of our physical function at about age\r\neighteen. How high that peak level is depends on a person's genetic\r\nendowment, the quality of the start they received through their\r\nmother's nutritional reserves, and the quality of their childhood\r\nnutrition and life experience. From that peak our function begins to\r\ndrop. The rate of drop is not uniform, but is a cascade where each\r\nbit of deterioration creates more deterioration, accelerating the\r\nrate of deterioration. If various aging experiences were graphed,\r\nthey would make curves like those on the chart on this page.\r\n\r\nBecause deterioration starts out so slowly, people usually do not\r\nbegin to notice there has been any decline until they reach their\r\nlate 30s. A few fortunate ones don't notice it until their 40s. A\r\nfew (usually) dishonest ones claim no losses into their 50s but they\r\nare almost inevitably lying, either to you or to themselves, or\r\nboth. Though it might be wisest to begin combating the aging process\r\nat age 19, practically speaking, no one is going to start spending\r\nsubstantial money on food supplements until they actually notice\r\nsignificant lost function. For non-athletes this point usually comes\r\nwhen function has dropped to about 90 percent of what it was in our\r\nyouth. If they're lucky what people usually notice with the\r\nbeginnings of middle age is an increasing inability for their bodies\r\nto tolerate insults such as a night on the town or a big meal. Or\r\nthey may begin to get colds that just won't seem to go away. Or they\r\nmay begin coming home after work so tired that they can hardly stay\r\nawake and begin falling asleep in their Lazy Boy recliner in front\r\nof the TV even before prime time. If they're not so lucky they'll\r\nbegin suffering the initial twinges of a non-life-threatening\r\nchronic condition like arthritis.\r\n\r\nThe thinnest line demonstrates the worst possible life from a purely\r\nphysical point of view, where a person started out life with\r\nsignificantly lowered function, lost quite a bit more and then hung\r\non to life for many years without the mercy of death.\r\n\r\nIf one can postpone the deterioration of aging, they extend and\r\nhopefully square the curve (retard loss of function until later and\r\nthen have the loss occur more rapidly). Someone whose lifetime\r\nfunction resembled a \"square curve\"(the thickest, topmost line)\r\nwould experience little or no deterioration until the very end and\r\nthen would lose function precipitously. At this point we do not know\r\nhow to eliminate the deterioration but we do know how to slow it\r\ndown, living longer and feeling better, at least to a point close to\r\nthe very end.\r\n\r\nVitamin supplements can actually slow or even to a degree, reverse,\r\nthe aging process. However, to accomplish that task, they have to be\r\ntaken in amounts far greater than so-called minimum daily\r\nrequirements, using vitamins as though they were drugs, a\r\ntherapeutic approach to changing body chemistry profiles and making\r\nthem resemble a younger body. For example, research gerontologists\r\nlike Walford reason that if pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), in fairly\r\nsubstantial (but quite safe) doses can extend the life and improve\r\nthe function of old rats, there is every indication that it will do\r\na similar job on humans. Medical researchers and research\r\ngerontologists have noticed that many other vitamin and vitamin-like\r\nsubstances have similar effects on laboratory animals.\r\n\r\nSome will object that what helps rats and mice is in no way proven\r\nto cause the same result on humans. I agree. Proven with full\r\nscientific rigor, no. In fact, at present, the contention is\r\nunprovable. Demonstrable as having a high likelihood's of being so,\r\nyes! So likely so as to be almost incontrovertible, yes! But\r\nprovable to the most open-minded, scientific sort--probably not for a\r\nlong time. However, the Life Extension Foundation is working hard to\r\nfind some quantifiable method of gauging the aging process in humans\r\nwithout waiting for the inarguable indicator, death. Once this is\r\naccomplished and solidly recognized, probably no rational person\r\nwill be able to doubt that human life span can be increased.\r\n\r\nExperiments work far better with short-lived laboratory animals for\r\nanother reason; we can not control the food and supplement intakes\r\nof humans as we can with caged mice. In fact, there are special\r\ntypes of laboratory mice that have been bred to have uniformly short\r\nlife spans, especially to accelerate this kind of research. With\r\nmice we can state accurately that compared to a control group,\r\nfeeding such and such a dose of such and such a supplement extended\r\nthe life-span or functional performance by such and such a percent.\r\n\r\nA lot of these very same medical gerontologists nourish their own\r\nbodies as thoroughly as the laboratory animals they are studying,\r\ntaking broad mixes of food supplements at doses proportional to\r\nthose that extend the life spans of their research animals. This\r\napproach to using supplementation is at the other end of the scale\r\ncompared to using supplements to prevent gross deficiencies. In the\r\nlife extension approach, vitamins and vitamin-like substances are\r\nused as a therapy against the aging process itself.\r\n\r\nWill it work? Well, some of these human guinea pigs have been on\r\nheavy vitamin supplementation for over thirty years (as of 1995) and\r\nnone seem to be suffering any damage. Will they live longer? It is\r\nimpossible to say with full scientific rigor? To know if life\r\nextension works, we would have to first determine \"live longer than\r\nwhat?\" After all, we don't know how long any person might have lived\r\nwithout life extending vitamin supplements. Though it can't be\r\n\"proven,\" it makes perfect sense to me to spend far less money on an\r\nintensive life extension vitamin program than I would certainly lose\r\nas a result of age-related sickness.\r\n\r\nBesides, I've already observed from personal use and from results in\r\nmy clinical practice that life extension vitamin programs do work.\r\nWhether I and my clients will ultimately live longer or not, the\r\npeople who I have put on these programs, including myself and my\r\nhusband, usually report that for several years after starting they\r\nfind themselves feeling progressively younger, gradually returning\r\nto an overall state of greater well-being they knew five or ten or\r\nfifteen years ago. They have more energy, feel clearer mentally,\r\nhave fewer unwanted somatic symptoms.\r\n\r\nSometimes the improvements seem rather miraculous. After a few\r\nmonths on the program one ninety year old man, an independent-minded\r\nOregonian farmer, reported that he began awakening with an erection\r\nevery morning; unfortunately, his 89 year old cranky and somewhat\r\nestranged wife, who would not take vitamins, did not appreciate this\r\nyouthfulness. A few months later (he had a small farm) he planted a\r\nholly orchard. Most of you won't appreciate what this means without\r\na bit of explanation, but in Oregon, holly is grown as a high-priced\r\nand highly profitable ornamental for the clusters of leaves and\r\nberries. But a slow-growing holly orchard takes 25 years to began\r\nmaking a profit!\r\n\r\nA few older clients of mine reported that they noticed nothing from\r\nthe life extension program, but these are unique people who have\r\ndeveloped the ability to dominate their bodies with their minds and\r\nroutinely pay their bodies absolutely no attention, driving them\r\nrelentlessly to do their will. Usually they use their energies to\r\naccomplish good, Christian works. Eventually, these dedicated and\r\nhigh-toned people break down and die like everyone else. Will they\r\ndo so later on life extending vitamins than they would have\r\notherwise? I couldn't know because I can't know how long they might\r\nhave lived without supplementation and since they refuse to admit\r\nthe vitamins do them any good, they won't pay for them.\r\n\r\nMany on life extension programs experience a reverse aging process\r\nfor awhile. However, after the full benefit of the supplementation\r\nhas worked itself through their body chemistry, they again begin to\r\nexperience the aging process. I believe the process will then be\r\nslowed by their vitamins compared to what it would have been without\r\nsupplements. But I can't prove it. Maybe we will have some idea if\r\nthe program worked 20 to 40 years from now.\r\n\r\nAt this time I know of only two companies that make top quality life\r\nextension vitamin supplement formulas. One is Prolongevity (Life\r\nExtension Foundation), the other, Vitamin Research Products. I\r\nprefer to support what I view as the altruistic motives behind\r\nProlongevity and buy my products from them. Unfortunately, these\r\nvitamin compounders can not put every possibly beneficial substance\r\nin a single bottle of tablets. The main reason they do not is fear\r\nof the power-grabbing Food and Drug Administration. This agency is\r\nthreatening constantly to remove certain of the most useful\r\nlife-extending substances from the vitamin trade and make them the\r\nexclusive property of prescription-writing medical doctors. So far,\r\npublic pressure has been mobilized against the FDA every time action\r\nwas threatened and has not permitted this. If some product were\r\nincluded in a mix and that product were prohibited, the entire\r\nmixed, bottled and labeled batch that remained unsold at that time\r\nwould be wasted, at enormous cost.\r\n\r\nWere I manufacturing my own life extension supplement I would\r\ninclude the following. By the way, to get this all in one day, it is\r\nnecessary to take 6 to 12 large tablets daily, usually spread\r\nthroughout the day, taken a few at a time with each meal. If you\r\ncompare my suggested formulation to another one, keep in mind that\r\nvariations of 25 percent one way or another won't make a significant\r\ndifference, and adding other beneficial substances to my\r\nrecommendations probably is only helpful. However, I would not want\r\nto eliminate anything in the list below, it is the minimum:\r\n\r\nBeta-Carotene 25,000 iu Selenium 100 mcg\r\n\r\nVitamin A 5,000 iu Taurine 500 mg\r\n\r\nB-1 250 mg Cyctine 200 mg\r\n\r\nB-2 50 mg Gluthaianone 15 mg\r\n\r\nB-3 niacinamid 850 mg Choline 650 mg\r\n\r\nB-5 750 mg Inositol 250 mg\r\n\r\nB-6 200 mg Flavanoids 500 mg\r\n\r\nB-12 100 mcg Zinc 35 mg\r\n\r\nPABA 50 mg Chromium 100 mcg\r\n\r\nFolic Acid 500 mcg Molybdenum 123 mg\r\n\r\nBiotin 200 mcg Manganese 5 mg\r\n\r\nVitamin C 3,000 mg Iodine (as kelp) 10 mg\r\n\r\nVitamin E 600 iu Co-Enzyme Q-10 60 mg\r\n\r\nMagnesium 1,000 mg DMAE 100 mg\r\n\r\nPotassium 100 mg Ginko biloba 120 mg\r\n\r\nCalcium 1,000 mg Vitamin D-3 200 iu\r\n\r\nPlease also keep in mind that there are many other useful substances\r\nnot listed above. For example, every day I have a \"green drink,\" an\r\nherbal preparation containing numerous tonic substances like ginseng\r\nand also various forms of algae and chlorophyll extracts. My green\r\ndrink makes my body feel very peppy all day, so it certainly\r\nenhances my life and may extend it. It costs about $25,00 a month to\r\nenjoy that. I also use various pure amino acids at times.\r\nPhenylalyanine will make me get more aggressive whenever I am\r\nfeeling a little lackluster; this nutrient has also been used as an\r\neffective therapy against depression. Melatonin taken at bedtime\r\nreally does help me get to sleep and may have remarkable\r\nlife-extending properties. Other amino acids help my body\r\nmanufacture growth hormones and I use them from the time I begin\r\ntraining seriously in spring through the end of the summer triathlon\r\ncompetition season. Pearson and Shaw's book (see Bibliography) is a\r\ngood starting point to begin learning about this remarkably useful\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe Future Of Life Extension\r\n\r\nI beg the readers indulgence for a bit of futurology about what\r\nthings may look like if the life extension movement continues to\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\nRight now, a full vitamin and vitamin-like substance life extension\r\nprogram costs between $50 and $100 dollars per month. However,\r\npharmaceutical researchers occasionally notice that drugs meant to\r\ntreat and cure diseases, when tested on lab animals for safety, make\r\nthese animals live quite a bit longer and function better. Though\r\nthe FDA doesn't allow any word of this to be printed in official\r\nprescribing data, the word does get around to other researchers, to\r\ngerontologists and eventually to that part of the public that is\r\neagerly looking for longer life. Today there are numerous people who\r\nroutinely take prescription medicines meant to cure a disease they\r\ndo not have and plan to take those medicines for the rest of their\r\nlong, long life.\r\n\r\nThese drugs being patented, the tariff gets a lot steeper compared\r\nto taking vitamins. (Since they are naturally-occurring substances,\r\nvitamins can't be patented and therefore, aren't big-profit items.\r\nPerhaps that's one reason the FDA is so covertly opposed to\r\nvitamins.) Right now it would be quite possible to spend many\r\nhundred dollars per month on a life extension program that included\r\nmost of these potentially beneficent prescription drugs.\r\n\r\nAs more of life-extending substances are discovered, the cost of\r\nparticipating in a maximally effective life extension program will\r\nescalate. However, those who can afford chemically enhanced\r\nfunctioning will enjoy certain side-benefits. Their productive,\r\nenjoyable life spans may measure well over a century, perhaps\r\napproaching two centuries or more. Some of these substances greatly\r\nimprove intelligence so they will become brighter and have faster\r\nreaction times. With more time to accumulate more wisdom and\r\nexperience than \"short livers\" these folks will become wiser, too.\r\nThey will have more time to compound their investment assets and\r\nthus will become far more wealthy. They will become an obvious and\r\nrecognizable aristocracy. This new upper class will immediately\r\nrecognize each other on the street because they will look entirely\r\ndifferent than the short-lived poorer folk and will probably run the\r\npolitical economic system.\r\n\r\nAnd this new aristocratic society I see coming may be far more\r\npleasant than the one dominated by the oligarchy we now have\r\ncovertly running things. For with greater age and experience does\r\nreally come greater wisdom. I have long felt that the biggest\r\nproblem with Earth is that we did not live long enough. As George\r\nBernard Shaw quipped when he was 90 (he lived to 96), \"here I am, 90\r\nyears old, just getting out of my adolescence and getting some\r\nsense, and my body is falling apart as fast as it can.\"\r\n\r\nVitamin Program For The Sick\r\n\r\nNo matter which way you look at it or how well insured you may be\r\nagainst it, being sick is expensive (not to mention what it does to\r\none's quality of life), and by far the best thing to do is to\r\nprevent it from happening in the first place. However, most people\r\ndo not do anything about their health until forced to by some\r\npainful condition. If you are already sick there are a number of\r\nsupplements you can take which have the potential to shorten the\r\nduration and severity of the illness, and hopefully prevent a\r\nrecurrence.\r\n\r\nThe sicker you are, the more supplements you will require; as health\r\nis regained, the dosage and variety of substances can be reduced. In\r\nchronic illness, megadoses of many nutrients are usually beneficial.\r\nAny sick adult should begin a life extension vitamin program unless\r\nthey are highly allergic to so many things already that they can not\r\ntolerate many kinds of vitamins as well. In addition to the life\r\nextension program, vitamin C should be taken by the chronically ill\r\nat a dose from 10 to 25 grams daily, depending on the severity of\r\nthe condition.\r\n\r\nMany people want to know whether or not they should take their\r\nregular food supplements during a fast. On a water fast most\r\nsupplements in a hard tablet form will not be broken down at all,\r\nand often can be seen floating by in the colonic viewing tube\r\nlooking exactly like it did when you swallowed it. This waste can be\r\navoided by crushing or chewing (yuck) the tablets, before\r\nswallowing. Encapsulated vitamins usually are absorbed, but if you\r\nwant to make sure, open the capsule and dump it in the back of your\r\nmouth before swallowing with water. Powdered vitamins are well\r\nabsorbed.\r\n\r\nOn a water fast the body is much more sensitive to any substance\r\nintroduced, so as a general rule it is not a good idea to take more\r\nthan one half your regular dose of food supplements. Most fasters do\r\nfine without any supplements. Many people get an upset stomach from\r\nsupplements on an empty stomach, and these people should not take\r\nany during a water fast unless they develop symptoms of mineral\r\ndeficiencies (usually a pre-existing condition) such as leg cramps\r\nand tremors, these symptoms necessitate powdered or well-chewed-up\r\nmineral supplement. Minerals don't taste too bad to chew, just\r\nchalky.\r\n\r\nThe same suggestions regarding dosage of supplements for a water\r\nfast are also true for a juice fast or vegetable broth fast. On a\r\nraw food cleansing diet the full dose of supplements should be taken\r\nwith meals.\r\n\r\nThere exists an enormous body of data about vitamins; books and\r\nmagazine articles are always touting some new product or explaining\r\nthe uses of an old one. If you want to know more about using\r\nordinary vitamins you'll find leads in the bibliography to guide\r\nyour reading. However, there is one \"old\" vitamin and a few newer\r\nand relatively unknown life extending substances that are so useful\r\nand important to handling illness that I would like to tell you more\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nVitamin C is not a newly discovered vitamin, but was one of the\r\nfirst ever identified. If you are one of those people that just hate\r\ntaking vitamins, and you were for some reason willing to take only\r\none, vitamin C would be your best choice. Vitamin C would be the\r\nclear winner because it helps enormously with any infection and in\r\ninvaluable in tissue healing and rebuilding collagen. If I was going\r\non a long trip and didn't want to pack a lot of weight, my first\r\nchoice would be to insure three to six grams of vitamin C for daily\r\nuse when I was healthy (I'd take the optimum dose--ten grams a day--if\r\nweight were no limitation). I'd also carry enough extra C to really\r\nbeef up my intake when dealing with an unexpected acute illness or\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nWhen traveling to far away places, exposed to a whole new batch of\r\norganisms, frequently having difficulty finding healthy foods, going\r\nthrough time zones, losing nights of sleep, it is easy to become\r\nenervated enough to catch a local cold or flu. If I have brought\r\nlots of extra vitamin C with me I know that my immune system will be\r\nable to conquer just about anything--as long as I also stop eating\r\nand can take an enema. I also like to have vitamin C as a part of my\r\nfirst aid kit because if I experience a laceration, a sprain, broken\r\nbone, or a burn, I can increase my internal intake as well as apply\r\nit liberally directly on the damaged skin surface. Vitamin C can be\r\nput directly in the eye in a dilute solution with distilled water\r\nfor infections and injuries, in the ear for ear infections, and in\r\nthe nose for sinus infections. If you are using the acid form of C\r\n(ascorbic acid) and it smarts too much, make a more dilute solution,\r\nor switch to the alkaline form of C (calcium ascorbate) which can be\r\nused as a much more concentrated solution without a stinging\r\nsensation. Applied directly on the skin C in solution makes a very\r\neffective substitute for sun screen. It doesn't filter out\r\nultraviolet, it beefs up the skin to better deal with the insult.\r\n\r\nI believe vitamin C can deal with a raging infection such as\r\npneumonia as well or better than antibiotics. But to do that, C is\r\ngoing to have to be administered at the maximum dose the body can\r\nprocess. This is easily discoverable by a 'bowel tolerance test'\r\nwhich basically means you keep taking two or three grams of C each\r\nhour, (preferably in the powdered, most rapidly assimilable form)\r\nuntil you get a runny stool (the trots). The loose stool happens\r\nwhen there is so much C entering the small intestine that it is not\r\nall absorbed, but is instead, passed through to the large intestine.\r\nAt that point cut back just enough that the stool is only a little\r\nloose, not runny. At this dose, your blood stream will be as\r\nsaturated by vitamin C as you can achieve by oral ingestion.\r\n\r\nIt can make an important difference which type of vitamin C is taken\r\nbecause many people are unable to tolerate the acid form of C beyond\r\n8 or 10 grams a day, but they can achieve a therapeutic dose without\r\ndiscomfort with the alkaline (buffered) vitamin C products such as\r\ncalcium ascorbate, sodium ascorbate, or magnesium-potassium\r\nascorbates.\r\n\r\nVitamin C also speeds up the healing of internal tissues and damaged\r\nconnective tissue. Damaged internal tissues might include stomach\r\nulcers (use the alkaline form of vitamin C only), bladder and kidney\r\ninfections (acid form usually best), arthritic disorders with damage\r\nto joints and connective tissue (alkaline form usually best). Sports\r\ninjuries heal up a lot faster with a therapeutic dose of vitamin C.\r\nAs medicine, vitamin C should be taken at the rate of one or two\r\ngrams every two hours (depending on the severity of the condition),\r\nspaced out to avoid unnecessary losses in the urine which happens if\r\nit were taken ten grams at a time. If you regularly use the acid\r\nform of vitamin C powder, which is the cheapest, be sure to use a\r\nstraw and dissolve it in water or juice so that the acid does not\r\ndissolve the enamel on your teeth over time.\r\n\r\nAnd this is as good a point as any to mention that just like\r\nbroccoli is not broccoli, a vitamin is not necessarily a vitamin.\r\nVitamins are made by chemical and pharmaceutical companies. To make\r\nthis confusion even more interesting, the business names that appear\r\non vitamin bottles are not the real manufacturers. Bronson's\r\nPharmaceuticals is a distributor and marketer, not a manufacturer.\r\nThe same is true of every vitamin company I know of. These companies\r\nbuy bulk product by the barrel or sack; then encapsulate, blend and\r\nroll pills, bottle and label, advertise and make profit. The point\r\nof all this is that some actual vitamin manufacturers produce very\r\nhigh quality products and others shortcut. Vitamin distributors must\r\nmake ethical (or unethical) choices about their suppliers.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond the scope of this book to be a manual for going into\r\nthe vitamin business. However, there are big differences in how\r\neffective vitamins with the same chemical name are and the\r\ndifferences hinge on who actually brewed them up.\r\n\r\nFor example, there are at least two quality levels of vitamin C on\r\nthe market right now. The pharmaceutical grade is made by Roche or\r\nBASF. Another form, it could be called \"the bargain barrel brew,\" is\r\nmade in China. Top quality vitamin C is quite a bit more costly; as\r\nI write this, the price differential is about 40 percent between the\r\ncheap stuff and the best. This can make a big difference in bottle\r\nprice and profit. Most of the discount retail vitamin companies use\r\nthe Chinese product.\r\n\r\nThere's more than a price difference. The vitamin C from China\r\ncontains measurable levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, iron and other\r\ntoxic metals. The FDA allows this slightly contaminated product to\r\nbe sold in the US because the Recommended Daily Allowance for\r\nvitamin C is a mere 60 milligrams per day. Taken at that level, the\r\ntoxic metals would, as the FDA sees it, do no harm. However, many\r\nusers of vitamin C take 100--200 times the RDA. The cheap form of C\r\nwould expose them to potentially toxic levels of heavy metal\r\npoisons. The highly refined top-quality product removes impurities\r\nto a virtually undetectable level.\r\n\r\nI buy my C from Bronson who ethically gives me the quality stuff. I\r\nknow for a fact that the vitamin C sold by Prolongevity is also top\r\nquality. I've had clients who bought cheaper C than Bronson's and\r\ndiscovered it was not quite like Bronson's in appearance or taste.\r\nMore importantly, it did not seem to have the same therapeutic\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe distributors I've mentioned so far, Bronson, NOW, Cooper,\r\nProlongevity and Vitamin Research Products are all knowledgeable\r\nabout differences between actual manufacturers and are ethical,\r\nbuying and reselling only high quality products. Other distributors\r\nI believe to be reputable include Twin Labs, Schiff and Plus. I know\r\nthere are many other distributors with high ethic levels but I can\r\nnot evaluate all their product lines. And as I've mentioned earlier,\r\nbusinesses come and go rather quickly, but I hope my book will be\r\nread for decades. I do know that I would be very reluctant to buy my\r\nvitamins at a discount department store or supermarket; when\r\nexperimenting with new suppliers I have at times been severely\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\nCo-enzyme Q-10. This substance is normally manufactured in the human\r\nbody and is also found in minuscule amounts in almost every cell on\r\nEarth. For that reason it is also called \"ubiquinone.\" But this\r\nvitamin has been only recently discovered, so as I write this book\r\nCo-enzyme Q-10 is not widely known.\r\n\r\nQ-10 is essential to the functioning of the mitochondria, that part\r\nof the cell that produces energy. With less Q-10 in heart cells, for\r\nexample, the heart has less energy and pumps less. The same is true\r\nof the immune system cells, the liver cells, every cell. As we age\r\nthe body is able to make less and less Q-10, contributing to the\r\nloss of energy frequently experienced with age, as well as the\r\ndiminished effectiveness of the immune system, and a shortened life\r\nspan.\r\n\r\nQ-10 was first used for its ability to revitalize heart cells. It\r\nwas a prescription medicine in Japan. But unlike other drugs used to\r\nstimulate the heart, at any reasonable dose Q-10 has no harmful side\r\neffects. It also tends to give people the extra pick up they are\r\ntrying to get out of a cup of coffee. But Q-10 does so by improving\r\nthe function of every cell in the body, not by whipping exhausted\r\nadrenals like caffeine does. Q-10 is becoming very popular with\r\nathletes who measure their overall cellular output against known\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\nBesides acting as a general tonic, when fed to lab animals,\r\nCo-Enzyme Q-10 makes them live 33 to 45 percent longer!\r\n\r\nDMAE is another extremely valuable vitamin-like substance that is\r\nnot widely known. It is a basic building material that the body uses\r\nto make acetylcholine, the most generalized neurotransmitter in the\r\nbody. Small quantities of DMAE are found in fish, but the body\r\nusually makes it in a multi-stage synthesis that starts with the\r\namino acid choline, arrives at DMAE at about step number three and\r\nends up finally with acetylcholine.\r\n\r\nThe body's nerves are wrapped in fatty tissue that should be\r\nsaturated with acetylcholine. Every time a nerve impulse is\r\ntransmitted from one nerve cell to the next, a molecule of\r\nacetylcholine is consumed. Thus acetylcholine has to be constantly\r\nreplaced. As the body ages, levels of acetylcholine surrounding the\r\nnerves drop and in consequence, the nerves begin to deteriorate.\r\nDMAE is rapidly and easily converted into acetylcholine and helps\r\nmaintain acetylcholine levels in older people at a youthful level.\r\n\r\nWhen laboratory rats are fed DMAE they solve mazes more rapidly,\r\nremember better, live about 40 percent longer than rats not fed DMAE\r\nand most interestingly, when autopsied, their nervous systems\r\nresemble those of a young rat, without any evidence of the usual\r\ndeterioration of aging. Human nervous systems also deteriorate with\r\nage, especially those of people suffering from senility. It is\r\nhighly probable that DMAE will do the same thing to us. DMAE also\r\nsmoothes out mood swings in humans and seems to help my husband,\r\nSteve, when he has a big writing project. He can keep working\r\nwithout getting 'writers block', fogged out, or rollercoastering.\r\n\r\nDMAE is a little hard to find. Prolongevity and VRP sell it in\r\npowder form. Since the FDA doesn't know any MDR and since the\r\nproduct is not capped up, the bottle of powder sagely states that\r\none-quarter teaspoonful contains 333 milligrams. Get the hint? DMAE\r\ntastes a little like sour salt and one-quarter teaspoonful dissolves\r\nreadily in water every morning before breakfast, or anytime for that\r\nmatter. DMAE is also very inexpensive considering what it does. A\r\nyear's supply costs about $20.\r\n\r\nLecithin is a highly tonic and inexpensive food supplement that is\r\nunderutilized by many people even though it is easily obtainable in\r\nhealthfood stores. It is an emulsifier, breaking fats down into\r\nsmall separate particles, keeping blood cholesterol emulsified to\r\nprevent arterial deposits. Taken persistently, lecithin partially\r\nand slowly eliminates existing cholesterol deposits from the\r\ncirculatory system.\r\n\r\nIn our cholesterol-frightened society lecithin should be a far more\r\npopular supplement than it currently is. It is easy to take either\r\nas a food in the granular form or when encapsulated. Lecithin\r\ngranules have very little flavor and can be added to a home-made\r\nvinegar and oil salad dressing, where they emulsify the oil and make\r\nit blend with the vinegar, thickening the mixture and causing it to\r\nstick to the salad better. Lecithin can also be put in a fruits\r\nsmoothie. A scant tablespoon a day is sufficient. Try to buy the\r\nkind of lecithin that has the highest phosphatidyl choline content\r\nbecause this substance is the second benefit of taking lecithin.\r\nPhosphatidyl choline is another precursor used by the body to build\r\nacetylcholine and helps maintain the nervous system.\r\n\r\nAlgae. Spirulina or sun dried chlorella are also great food\r\nsupplements. Both make many people feel energized, pepped-up. It is\r\npossible to fast on either product and still maintain sufficient\r\nenergy levels to take of minimal work responsibilities. Algae\r\nreduces appetite and as a dietary supplement can assist in weight\r\nloss. It contains large amounts of highly-assimilable protein due to\r\nit's high chlorophyll content, as well as a large amount of beta\r\ncarotene. It also assists in detoxification of the lymphatic system.\r\nIt can be purchased as tablets or powder. Take a heaping teaspoon\r\ndaily, or at least six tablets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Seven\r\n\r\nThe Analysis of Disease States: Helping the Body Recover\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Hygienic Dictionary\r\n\r\nDiagnosis. [1] In the United States, making a diagnosis implies that\r\nyou are a doctor duly licensed to engage in diagnostic function....\r\nThe making of a diagnosis is reserved only for doctors.... The\r\nterm \"analysis\" does not have such an explicit legal definition.\r\nThus, it is the term of choice of iridologists and the one most\r\noften used by them. It is essential for the survival and promotion\r\nof iridology that those who choose to engage in its practice avoid\r\nnaming any disease condition. As we have seen, to do so is to\r\ninfringe on rights reserved exclusively for doctors and can land the\r\niridologist, sooner or later, in a snarl of legal troubles.\r\n\r\nIt is better for the iridologist to refrain from suggesting to a\r\nperson that he has any particular disease, letting such diagnostics\r\nremain the province of licensed doctors. In so doing, the\r\niridologist will avoid transgressing the law and stepping on the\r\ntoes of those who are legally qualified to diagnose.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed unfortunate that one of the greatest pitfalls awaiting\r\nthe iridologist is the temptation to name diseases. The feelings of\r\nsatisfaction and power resulting from conferring a name are deeply\r\nrooted in the human psyche. For example, the Bible tells us that\r\nman's first task on Earth was to name the animals, thus giving him\r\npower and dominion over them.\r\n\r\nStrong is the temptation to name diseases because nearly everyone\r\nhas come to expect that his malady has a name. Patients have come to\r\nexpect, and doctors have been trained to make, a diagnosis. . . .\r\n\"After all,\" the patient may reason, \"how can you hope to deal with\r\nmy condition if you aren't knowledgeable enough to call it by name?\"\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to name diseases in order to exercise dominion\r\nover them. _Dr. Bernard Jensen, Visions of Health._\r\n\r\nIn self defense, I must make it very clear from the first word that\r\nhygienists and most other naturopaths of various persuasions, and\r\nespecially I myself, have never in the past, never!, and do not now,\r\ndiagnose, treat or offer to cure, disease or illness. Diagnosis and\r\ncuring are sole, exclusive privileges of certified, duly-licensed\r\nmedical doctors and may only be done with a grant of Authority to do\r\nso from the State. Should an unlicensed person diagnose, offer to\r\ntreat or attempt to cure disease or illness, they will have\r\ncommitted a felonious act. With big penalties. Therefore, I do not\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nWhen one of my clients comes to me and says that a medical doctor\r\nsays they have some disease or other, I agree that the medical\r\ndoctor says they have some disease or other, and I never dare say\r\nthat they don't. Or even confirm on my own authority that I think\r\nthey do have some disease or other.\r\n\r\nWhat I can legally do for a client is to analyze the state of their\r\nbody and its organs, looking for weaknesses and apparent allergies.\r\nI can lawfully state that I think their liver tests weak, the\r\npancreas appears not to be functioning well in terms of handling\r\nmeat digestion, that the kidney is having a hard time of it. I can\r\nsay I see a lump sticking out of their body when one is obviously\r\nsticking out of their body; I can not say that lump is cancerous but\r\nI can state that the cells in that lump test overly strong and that\r\nif I myself had a mass of growing cells testing overly strong and if\r\nI believed in the standard medical model, then I would be rushing my\r\noverly strong testing cells to an oncologist. But I don't dare say\r\nthe person has a cancer. Or diabetes. Or is getting close to kidney\r\nfailure. That is a diagnosis.\r\n\r\nTo me, diagnosis is a form of magic rite in which the physician\r\ndiscovers the secret name of the devil that is inhabiting one's body\r\nand then, knowing that secret name, performs the correct rite and\r\nritual to cast that demon out. I don't know why people are made so\r\nhappy knowing the name of their condition! Does it really matter?\r\nEither the body can heal the condition or it can't. If it can, you\r\nwill recover (especially if you give the body a little help). If the\r\nbody can't heal a condition you will die or live a long time being\r\nmiserable. No \"scientific\" medical magic can do better than that.\r\n\r\nBy describing a disease in terms of its related organ weaknesses,\r\ninstead of pinning a Latin name on it, I am able to assist the body\r\nto achieve recovery in a superior way that the physician rarely\r\ndoes. By discovering that the body with the lump of overly strong\r\ncells also has a weak spleen, liver and thymus gland, I can take\r\nactions to strengthen the spleen, liver and thymus. If the body can\r\nstrengthen its spleen, liver and thymus, then the overly strong\r\ncells miraculously vanish. But of course I and what I did did not\r\ncure any disease. Any improvements that happen I assign (correctly)\r\nto the body's own healing power.\r\n\r\nThe way I analyze the organic integrity of the body is through a\r\nnumber of related methods, including the general appearance of the\r\nbody, the patient's health history, various clues such as body and\r\nbreath odor, skin color and tone, and especially, biokinesiology,\r\nthe applied science of muscle testing. Biokinesiology can be used to\r\ntest the strength or weakness of specific organs and their function.\r\nA weak latissimus dorsi muscle indicates a weak pancreas, for\r\nexample. Specific acupuncture points can be tested in conjunction\r\nwith muscle strength to indicate the condition of specific organs or\r\nglands. The strength of the arm's resistance to downward pressure\r\ncould be calibrated with a spring scale and precisely gauged, but\r\nexperienced practitioners have no need for this bother, because they\r\nare able to pick up subtle changes in the arms resistance that are\r\nnot apparent to the testee. Thus muscle testing becomes an art\r\nform, and becomes as effective as the person using it is sensitive\r\nand aware.\r\n\r\nBiokinesiology works because every organ and gland in the body is\r\ninterconnected with other parts of the body through nerve pathways\r\nand nerve transmissions, which are electrical and can be measured\r\nthrough muscle testing. This may seem too esoteric for the\r\n\"scientific\" among you, but acupuncture points and energy\r\nmanifestations around and in the body--are now accepted phenomena,\r\ntheir reality demonstrated by special kinds of photography.\r\nAcupuncturists, who heal by manipulating the body's energy field\r\nwith metal needles, are now widely accepted in the western\r\nhemisphere. Kinesiology utilizes the same acupuncture points (and\r\nsome others too) for analytic purposes so it is sometimes called\r\n\"contact reflex analysis.\"\r\n\r\nI have studied and used Kinesiology for 25 years with the majority\r\nof my clients with very good success. There are some few people who\r\nare very difficult to test because they are either too debilitated,\r\nlack electrical conductivity, or their state of mind is so skeptical\r\nand negative about this type of approach that they put up an\r\nimpenetrable mental barrier and/or hold their body so rigidly that I\r\ncan hardly determine a response. A skilled can overcome the obstacle\r\nof a weak body that can barely respond, but the person who is\r\nmentally opposed and determined to prove you wrong should not be\r\ntested. If you proceed it is sure to have an unsatisfactory outcome\r\nfor all concerned. For even if I manage to accurately analyze the\r\ncondition of a skeptical client, they will never believe the\r\nanalysis and will not follow suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe \"scientific,\" open-minded, \"reasonable\" client can be better\r\napproached using an academic-like discussion based on published\r\nliterature that demonstrates how people with similar symptoms and\r\ncomplaints do very well on a particular dietary regimen and\r\nsupplements. This type of person will sometimes follow dietary\r\nrecommendations to the last letter, because their scientific\r\nbackground has trained them to be obedient.\r\n\r\nWhen a client comes to me, I like to take a real good look at who is\r\nsitting in front of me. I take my leisure to find out all about\r\ntheir history, their complaints, their motivation to change, their\r\nexperience with natural healing, their level of personal\r\nresponsibility, whether or not they have to work, whether or not\r\nthey can take time out to heal, will they fast or take supplements,\r\ndo they have sufficient finances to carry a program through to a\r\nsuccessful completion, do they have people closely connected to them\r\nthat are strongly opposed to alternative approaches, can they\r\nwithstand some discomfort and self-denial, do they have toxic\r\nrelationships with other people that are contributing to their\r\ncondition, are they willing to read and educate themselves in\r\ngreater depth about natural healing, etc. I need to know the answers\r\nto these questions in order to help them choose a program which is\r\nmost likely to succeed.\r\n\r\nEven though fasting is the most effective method I know of, it is\r\nnot for people who are compelled to keep up a work schedule, nor is\r\nit for people who are very ill and do not have anyone to assist them\r\nand supervise them. Nor is it for people who do not understand\r\nfasting and are afraid of it. People who have associates that are\r\nopposed to it, and people who do not have a strongly-functioning\r\nliver or kidneys should not fast either. Seriously ill people that\r\nhave been on a meat-heavy diet with lots of addicting substances\r\nneed a long runway into a fast so as to not overwhelm their organs\r\nof elimination. Does the person in front of me have an eating\r\ndisorder, or an otherwise suicidal approach to fasting, etc. Clearly\r\nfasting is not for everyone, and if I recommend it to the wrong\r\nperson, the result will be a bad reputation for a marvelous tool.\r\n\r\nGiven that many clients can not fast without a lot of preparation,\r\nthe majority of my clients start out with a gentle detox program\r\nthat takes considerably more time, but works. These gradients have\r\nbeen outlined under the healing programs for the chronically ill,\r\nacutely ill, etc.\r\n\r\nTo help rebuild poorly functioning organs, I sometimes use a\r\nspecialized group of food supplements called protomorphogens. These\r\nare not readily available to the general public and perhaps should\r\nnot be casually purchasable like vitamins, because, as with many\r\nprescription drugs, supervision is usually necessary for their\r\nsuccessful use. If the FDA ever succeeds at making protomorphogens\r\nunavailable to me, I could still have very good results. (At this\r\ntime the Canadian authorities do not allow importation of\r\nprotomorphogens for resale, though individuals can usually clear\r\nsmall shipments through Canada Customs if for their own personal\r\nuse.) But protomorphogens do facilitate healing and sometimes permit\r\nhealing to occur at a lower gradient of handling. Without them a\r\nbody might have to fast to heal, with the aid of protomorphogens a\r\nperson might be able to get better without fasting. And if\r\nprotomorphogens are used (chewed up--ugh!) while fasting, healing is\r\naccelerated.\r\n\r\nProtomorphogens are made from freeze-dried, organically-raised\r\nanimal organ meats (usually calf or lamb) combined with very\r\nspecific vitamins, herbs and other co-factors to potentiate the\r\neffect. I view protomorphogens as containing nutritional\r\nsupplementation specific for the rebuilding of the damaged organ.\r\n\r\nDoctor Royal Lee, a medical genius who developed protomorphogens\r\ntherapy in the 50s and who spent several stints in prison in\r\nexchange for his benevolence and concern for human well-being, also\r\nfounded the company that has supplied me with protomorphogens. After\r\ndecades of official persecution and denial of the efficacy of\r\nprotomorphogens by the power structure, it looks like they are about\r\nto finally have their day. As I write this book cutting-edge medical\r\nresearch companies are developing therapies using concentrated\r\nanimal proteins (protomorphogens) to treat arthritis, multiple\r\nsclerosis, eye inflamations and juvenile diabetes. The researchers\r\ntalk as though they are highly praiseworthy for \"discovering\" this\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this development is likely to cut two ways. On one\r\nhand, it vindicates Dr. Lee; on the other, when these drug companies\r\nfind a way to patent their materials, they may finally succeed at\r\nforcing protomorphogens (currently quite inexpensive) off the\r\nnon-prescription market and into the restricted and profitable\r\nprovince of the MD.\r\n\r\nI divide clients into two basic types: simple cases and complex\r\nones. When I was treating mental illness, occasionally I had a\r\nclient who had not been sick for too long. I could usually make this\r\nclient well quite easily. But if the person had already become\r\ninstitutionalized, had been psychotic for many years, had received\r\nmuch prior treatment, then their case had been made much more\r\ndifficult. This sort had a poor prognosis. A very similar situation\r\nexists with physical illnesses. Many people get sick only because\r\nthey lack information about how to keep themselves healthy and about\r\nwhat made them sick. Once they find out the truth, they take my\r\nmedicine without complaint and almost inevitably get better very\r\nrapidly. Some of these people can be quite ill when they first come\r\nto me but usually they have not been sick for very long. Their\r\nintention when coming into my office is very positive and have no\r\ncounter intentions to getting better. There are no spiritual or\r\npsychological reasons that they deserve to be sick. If this person\r\nhad not found me, they almost certainly would have found some other\r\npractitioner who would have made them well. This type of person\r\nhonestly feels they are entitled to wellness. And they are.\r\n\r\nHowever, some of the sick are not sick for lack of life-style\r\ninformation; they suffer from a mental/spiritual malady as well, one\r\nthat inevitably preceded their illness by many years. In fact, their\r\nphysical ailments are merely reflections of underlying problems.\r\nThis patient's life is usually a snarl of upsets, problems, and\r\nguilty secrets. Their key relationships are usually vicious or\r\nunhealthy. Their level of interpersonal honesty may be poor. There\r\nare usually many things about their lives they do not confront and\r\nso, can not change. With this type of case, all the physical healing\r\nin the world will not make them permanently better because the\r\nmental and emotional stresses they live under serve as a constant\r\nsource of enervation.\r\n\r\nCases like this usually do not have only one thing wrong with them.\r\nThey almost always have been sick for a long time; most have been\r\nwhat I call \"doctor hoppers,\" confused by contrary diagnoses and\r\nconflicting MD opinions. When I get a case like this I know from the\r\nfirst that healing is going to be a long process, and a dubious one\r\nat that. On the physical level, their body will only repair one\r\naspect of their multiple illnesses at a time. Simultaneously, they\r\nmust be urged to confront their life on a gentle gradient. There is\r\nusually a lot of backsliding and rollercoastering. The\r\ndetoxification process, physical and psychological, can take several\r\nyears and must happen on all the levels of their life. This kind of\r\ncase sees only gradual improvement interspersed with periods of\r\nworsening that indicate there remains yet another level of mental\r\nunawareness that has to be unraveled.\r\n\r\nFew medical doctors or holistic therapists really understand or can\r\nhelp this kind of case. To do so, the doctor has to be in touch with\r\ntheir own reactive mind and their own negative, evil impulses (which\r\nvirtually all humans have). Few people, including therapists, are\r\nwilling to be aware of their own dark side. But when we deny it in\r\nourselves, we must pretend it doesn't exist in others, and become\r\nits victim instead of conquering it. Anyone who denies that they\r\nhave or are influenced by their own darker aspects who seem to be\r\ntotally sweet and light, is lying; proof of this is that they still\r\nare here on Earth.\r\n\r\nAll this generalizing about diagnostic methods and clinical\r\napproaches could go on for chapters and more chapters, and writing\r\nthem would be fine if I were teaching a group of health clinicians\r\nthat were reading this book to become better practitioners. But I'm\r\nsure most of my readers are far more interested in some complaint of\r\ntheir own or in the health problem of a loved one, and are intensely\r\ninterested in one might go about handling various conditions and\r\ncomplaints, what types of organ weaknesses are typically associated\r\nwith them, and what approaches I usually recommend to encourage\r\nhealing. And, most importantly, what kind of success or lack of it\r\nhave I had over the past twenty five years, encouraging the healing\r\nof various conditions with hygienic methods.\r\n\r\nIn the case studies that follow I will mostly report the simpler,\r\neasier-to-fix problems because that is what most people have; still,\r\nmany of these involve life-threatening or quality-of-life-destroying\r\nillnesses. I will tell the success story of one very complicated,\r\nlong-suffering case that involved multiple levels of psychological\r\nand spiritual handling as well as considerable physical healing.\r\n\r\nArthritis\r\n\r\nSome years back my 70 years old mother came from the family\r\nhomestead in the wilds of northern British Columbia to visit me at\r\nthe Great Oaks School. She had gotten into pathetic physical\r\ncondition. Fifteen years previously she had remarried. Tom, her new\r\nhusband, had been a gold prospector and general mountain man, a\r\nwonderfully independent and cantankerous cuss, a great hunter and\r\nwood chopper and all around good-natured backwoods homestead\r\nhandyman. Tom had tired of solitary log cabin life and to solve his\r\nproblem had taken on the care and feeding of a needy widow, my mom.\r\nHe began doing the cooking and menu planning. Tom, a little older\r\nthan my mother, had no sense about eating but could still shoot\r\ngame. Ever since their marriage she had been living on moose meat\r\nstews with potatoes and gravy, white flour bread with jam, black tea\r\nwith canned milk, a ritual glass of brandy at bedtime, and almost no\r\nfresh fruit or vegetables.\r\n\r\nIn her youth, my mother had been a concert pianist; now she had such\r\nlarge arthritic knobs on all of her knuckles that her hands had\r\nbecome claws. Though there was still that very same fine upright in\r\nthe cabin that I had learned to play as a child, she had long since\r\ngiven up the piano. Her knees also had large arthritic knobs; this\r\nproud woman with a straight back and long, flowing strides was bent\r\nover, limping along with a cane. She was also 30 pounds overweight\r\nand her blood pressure was a very dangerous 210 over 140, just\r\nasking for a stroke.\r\n\r\nInstead of a welcoming feast, the usual greeting offered to a loved\r\none who has not been seen for a few years, I immediately started her\r\non a juice fast. I gave her freshly prepared carrot juice (one quart\r\ndaily) mixed with wheat grass juice (three ounces daily) plus daily\r\ncolonics. She had no previous experience with these techniques but\r\nshe gamely accepted everything I threw her way because she knew I\r\nwas doing it because I loved her and wanted to see her in better\r\ncondition. She also received a daily full body massage with\r\nparticular attention to the hand and knees, stimulating the\r\ncirculation to the area and speeding the removal of wastes. Every\r\nnight her hands and knees were wrapped in warm castor oil compresses\r\nheld in place with old sheeting.\r\n\r\nI did not use any vitamins or food supplements in her case. I did\r\ngive her flavorful herbal teas made of peppermint and chamomile\r\nbecause she needed the comfort of a hot cupa; but these teas were in\r\nno way medicinal except for her morale.\r\n\r\nIn three weeks on this program, Grannybelle, as I and my daughters\r\ncalled her, had no unsightly knobs remaining on either her knuckles\r\nor knees and she could walk and move her fingers without pain within\r\na normal range of movement. The big payoff for me besides seeing her\r\nlook so wonderful (20 years younger and 20 pounds lighter) was to\r\nhear her sit down and treat us to a Beethoven recital. And her blood\r\npressure was 130 over 90.\r\n\r\nBreast Cancer\r\n\r\nI have worked with many young women with breast cancer; so many in\r\nfact, that their faces and cases tend to blur. But whenever I think\r\nabout them, Kelly inevitably comes to mind because we became such\r\ngood friends. Like me, Kelly was an independent-minded back country\r\nCanuck. At the age 26, she received a medical diagnosis of breast\r\ncancer. Kelly had already permitted a lumpectomy and biopsy, but had\r\nstudied the statistical outcomes and did not want to treat her\r\nillness with radical mastectomy, radiation and chemotherapy because\r\nshe knew her odds of long-term survival without radical medical\r\ntreatment were equal to or better than allowing the doctors to do\r\neverything possible. Nor did she want to lose even one of her\r\nbreasts. She knew how useful her breasts were because she had\r\nalready suckled one child, not to mention their contribution to\r\none's own self-image as a whole person. I admired Kelly's unusual\r\nindependent-mindedness because she comes from a country where\r\nuniversal health coverage is in place; her insurance would have paid\r\nall the costs had she been willing to accept conventional medicine,\r\nbut Canadian national health insurance does not cover alternative\r\ntherapy.\r\n\r\nKelly stayed with me for nearly two months as a residential faster,\r\nbecause she needed to be far from the distractions of a troubled\r\nfamily life. With financial support from her parents and child-care\r\nfrom her friends she was able to take time out to give the recovery\r\nof health top priority in her life without worrying about whether\r\nher small son was being well cared for. This peace of mind was also\r\nvery important to her recovery.\r\n\r\nAnalysis with biokinesiology showed a pervasively weak immune\r\nsystem, including a weak thymus gland, spleen, and an overloaded\r\nlymphatic system. Her liver was weak, but not as weak as it might\r\nhave been, because she had become a vegetarian, and had been working\r\non her health in a haphazard fashion for a few years. Kelly's body\r\nalso showed weaknesses in pancreatic and adrenal function as well as\r\na toxic colon. Most immediately worrisome to her, biokinesiology\r\ntesting showed several over-strong testing lumpy areas in the\r\nbreasts and over-strong testing lumpy lymph nodes in the armpits.\r\nCancerous tumors always test overly strong\r\n\r\nKelly's earlier life-style had contributed to her condition in\r\nseveral ways. She had worked for years in a forestry tree nursery\r\nhandling seedling trees treated with highly toxic chemicals. She had\r\nworked as a cook in a logging camp for several seasons, eating too\r\nmuch meat and greasy food. And she had also spent the usual number\r\nof adolescent and young adult years deeply involved in recreational\r\ndrug use and the bad diet that went with it.\r\n\r\nKelly started right in on a rigorous water fast that lasted for one\r\nentire month. She had a colonic every day, plus body work including\r\nreflexology, holding and massage of neurolymphatic and neurovascular\r\npoints, and stimulation of acupuncture points related to weak organ\r\nsystems and general massage to stimulate overall circulation and\r\nlymphatic drainage. She took protomorphogens to help rebuild her\r\nweakened organs; she took ten grams of vitamin C every day and a\r\nhalf-dose of life extension vitamin mix in assimilable powdered\r\nform; she drank herbal teas of echinacea and fenugreek seeds and\r\nseveral ounces of freshly squeezed wheat grass juice every day.\r\nTwice each day she made poultices out of clay and the pulp left over\r\nfrom making her wheat grass juice, filled an old bra with this\r\nmixture and pressed it to her breast for several hours until the\r\nclay dried. Shortly, I will explain all the measures in some detail.\r\n\r\nThese physical therapies were accompanied by counseling sessions\r\ndealing with some severe and long-unresolved problems, response\r\npatterns and relationships that triggered her present illness. Her\r\nson's father (Kelly's ex) was suppressive and highly intimidating.\r\nFearful of him, Kelly seemed unable to successfully extricate\r\nherself from the relationship due to the ongoing contact which\r\nrevolved over visitation and care of their son. But Kelly had grit!\r\nWhile fasting, she confronted these tough issues in her life and\r\nunflinchingly made the necessary decisions. When she returned to\r\nCanada she absolutely decided, without any nagging doubts,\r\nreservations or qualifications, to make any changes necessary to\r\nensure her survival. Only after having made these hard choices could\r\nshe heal.\r\n\r\nI one respect, Kelly was a highly unusual faster. Throughout the\r\nentire month on water, Kelly took daily long walks, frequently\r\nstopping to lie down and rest in the sun on the way. She would climb\r\nto or from the top of a very large and steep hill nearby. She never\r\nmissed a day, rain or shine.\r\n\r\nAt the end of her month on water Kelly's remaining breast lumps had\r\ndisappeared, the lymphatic system and immune system tested strong,\r\nas well as the liver, pancreas, adrenals, and large intestine. No\r\nareas tested overly strong.\r\n\r\nShe broke the fast with the same discipline she had conducted it, on\r\ncarrot juice, a cup every two hours. After three days on juice she\r\nbegan a raw food diet with small servings of greens and sprouts well\r\nchewed, interspersed at two hour intervals with fresh juicy fruits.\r\nAfter about ten days on \"rabbit food,\" she eased into avocados,\r\ncooked vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains and then went home.\r\n\r\nAs I write this, it is eight years since Kelly's long fast. She\r\nstill comes to see me every few years to check out her diet and just\r\nsay hello. She has had two more children by a new, and thoroughly\r\nwonderful husband and suckled them both for two years each; her\r\npeaceful rural life centers around this new, happy family and the\r\nbig, Organic garden she grows. She religiously takes her life\r\nextension vitamins and keeps her dietary and life-style\r\nindiscretions small and infrequent. She is probably going to live a\r\nlong, time.\r\n\r\nI consider Kelly's cluster of organ weaknesses very typical of all\r\ncancers regardless of type or location, as well as being typical of\r\nAIDS and other critical infections by organisms that usually reside\r\nin the human body without causing trouble (called \"opportunistic\").\r\nAll these diseases are varieties of immune system failure. All of\r\nthese conditions present a similar pattern of immune system\r\nweaknesses. They all center around what I call the \"deadly\r\ntriangle,\" comprised of a weak thymus gland, weak spleen, and a weak\r\nliver. The thymus and spleen form the core of the body's immune\r\nsystem. The weak liver contributes to a highly toxic system that\r\nfurther weakens the immune system. To top it off, people with cancer\r\ninvariably have a poor ability to digest cooked protein (animal or\r\nvegetable) (usually from a weak pancreas unable to make enough\r\ndigestive enzymes) and eat too much of it, giving them a very toxic\r\ncolon, and an overloaded lymphatic system.\r\n\r\nWhenever I analyze someone with this pattern, especially the entire\r\ndeadly triangle, I let the person know that if I had those\r\nparticular weaknesses I would consider my survival to be at\r\nimmediate risk I'd consider it an emergency situation demanding\r\nvigorous attention. It does not matter if they don't yet have a\r\ntumor, or fibroid, or opportunistic infection; if they don't already\r\nhave something of that nature they soon will.\r\n\r\nHere's yet another example of why I disapprove of diagnosis. By\r\ngiving the condition a name like \"lymphoma\" or \"melanoma\", \"chronic\r\nfatigue syndrome\" \"Epstein-Barr syndrome\" or \"AIDS,\" \"systemic yeast\r\ninfection\", \"hepatitis\" or what have, people think the doctor then\r\nunderstands their disease. But the doctor rarely understands that\r\nall these seemingly different diseases are essentially the same\r\ndisease--a toxic body with a dysfunctional immune system. What is\r\nrelevant is that a person with the deadly triangle must strengthen\r\ntheir immune system, and their pancreas, and their liver, and\r\ndetoxify their body immediately. If these repairs are accomplished\r\nin time, the condition goes away, whatever its Latin name may have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nNow, about some of the adjuncts to Kelly's healing. Let me stress\r\nhere that had none of these substances or practices been used, she\r\nprobably still would have recovered. Perhaps a bit more slowly.\r\nPerhaps a bit less comfortably. Conversely, had Kelly treated her\r\ncancer with every herb, poultice and vitamin known to man but had\r\nneglected fasting and colonics, she might well have died. It has\r\nbeen wisely said that intelligence may be defined as the ability to\r\ncorrectly determine differences, similarities, and importances. I\r\nwant my readers to be intelligent about understanding the relative\r\nimportances of different hygienic treatment and useful supporting\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nEchinacea and chaparral leaves, red clover flowers, and fenugreek\r\nseeds are made into medicinal teas that I find very helpful in\r\ndetoxification programs, because they all are aggressive blood or\r\nlymph cleansers and boost the immune response. These same teas can\r\nbe used to help the body throw off a cold, flu, or other acute\r\nillness but they have a much more powerful effect on a fasting body\r\nthan on one that is eating. Echinacea and chaparral are\r\nextraordinarily bitter and may be better accepted if ground up and\r\nencapsulated, or mixed with other teas with pleasant flavors such as\r\npeppermint or lemon grass. These teas should be simmered until they\r\nare at the strongest concentration palatable, drinking three or four\r\ncups of this concentrate a day. If you use echinacea, then chaparral\r\nprobably isn't necessary and visa versa. Red clover is another blood\r\ncleanser, perhaps a little less effective but it has a pleasant,\r\nsweet taste and may be better accepted by the squeamish.\r\n\r\nIf there is lymphatic congestion I always include fenugreek seed tea\r\nbrewed at the strength of approximately one tablespoon of seeds to a\r\nquart of water. Expect the tea to be brown, thick and mucilaginous,\r\nwith a reasonably pleasant taste reminiscent of maple syrup.\r\n\r\nKelly used poultices of clay and wheat grass pulp on her lumps,\r\nsomewhat like the warm castor oil poultices I used on my mother's\r\narthritic deposits. Poultices not only feel very comforting, but\r\nthey have the effect of softening up deposits and tumors so that a\r\ndetoxifying, fasting body is more able to re absorb them. Poultices\r\ndraw, pulling toxins out through the skin, unburdening the liver.\r\nClay (freshly-mixed potters clay I purchase from a potters' guild),\r\nmixed with finely chopped or blended young wheat grass (in\r\nemergencies I've even used lawn grasses) makes excellent drawing\r\npoultices. Without clay, I've also used vegetable poultices made of\r\nchopped or blended comfrey leaves, comfrey root, slightly cooked\r\n(barely wilted) cabbage leaves, slightly steamed onion or garlic\r\n(cooked just enough to soften it). These are very effective to\r\nsoften tumors, abscesses and ulcers. Aloe poultices are good on\r\nburns. Poultices should be thought of as helpful adjuncts to other,\r\nmore powerful healing techniques and not as remedies all by\r\nthemselves, except for minor skin problems.\r\n\r\nPoultices, to be effective, need to be troweled on half an inch\r\nthick, extending far beyond the effected area, covered with cheese\r\ncloth or rags torn from old cotton sheets so they don't dry out too\r\nfast. Fresh poultices needs to be applied several times daily. They\r\nalso need to be left on the body until they do dry. Then poultices\r\nare thrown away, to be followed by another as often as patience will\r\nallow. Do not cover poultices tightly with plastic because if they\r\ndon't dry out they won't draw much. The drawing is in the drying.\r\n\r\nSometimes poultices cause a tumor or deposit to be expelled through\r\nthe skin rather than being adsorbed, all with rather spectacular pus\r\nand gore. This phenomena is actually beneficial and should be\r\nwelcomed because anytime the body can push toxins out through the\r\nskin, the burden on the organs of elimination are lessened.\r\n\r\nWheat grass juice has a powerful anti-tumor effect, is very\r\nperishable, is laborious to make, but is worth the effort because it\r\ncontains powerful enzymes and nutrients that help detoxify and heal\r\nwhen taken internally or applied to the skin. As a last resort with\r\ndying patients who can no longer digest anything taken by mouth I've\r\nimplanted wheat grass juice rectally (in a cleansed colon). Some of\r\nthem haven't died. You probably can't buy wheat grass juice that\r\nretains much medicinal effect because it needs to be very fresh and\r\nshould be drunk within minutes of squeezing. Chilled sharply and\r\nimmediately after squeezing it might maintain some potency for an\r\nhour or two. Extracting juice from grass takes a special press that\r\nresembles a meat grinder.\r\n\r\nThe wheat is grown in transplant or seedling trays in bright light.\r\nI know someone who uses old plastic cafeteria trays for this. The\r\nseed is soaked overnight, spread densely atop a tray, covered\r\nshallowly with fine soil, kept moist but not soggy. When the grass\r\nis about four inches high, begin harvesting by cutting off the\r\nleaves with a scissors and juicing them. If the tray contains\r\nseveral inches of soil you usually get a second cutting of leaves.\r\nYou need to start a new tray every few days; one tray can be cut for\r\nthree or four days. (Kulvinskas, 1975)\r\n\r\nMore wheat grass juice is not better than just enough; three ounces\r\na day is plenty! It is a very powerful substance! The flavor of\r\nwheat grass juice is so intense that some people have to mix it with\r\ncarrot juice to get it down. DO NOT OVERUSE. The energizing effects\r\nof wheat grass can be so powerful that some people make a regular\r\npractice of drinking it. However, I've seen many people who use\r\nwheat grass juice as a tonic become allergic to it much as\r\nantibiotic dependent people do to antibiotics. Better to save wheat\r\ngrass for emergencies.\r\n\r\nI also have treated my own breast cancers--twice. The first time I\r\nwas only 23 years old. One night I noticed that it hurt to sleep the\r\nway I usually did on my left side because there was a hard lump in\r\nmy left breast. It was quite large--about the size of a goose egg.\r\nHaving just completed RN training two years prior, I had been well\r\nbrain washed about my poor prognosis and knew exactly what requisite\r\nactions must taken.\r\n\r\nI scheduled a biopsy under anesthetic, so that if the tumor was\r\nmalignant they could proceed to full mastectomy without delay. I was\r\nignorant of any alternative course of action at the time.\r\n\r\nI might add that before I grew my first tumor I had been consuming\r\nlarge amounts of red meat in a mistaken understanding gained in\r\nnursing school that a good diet contained large amounts of animal\r\nprotein. In addition to the stress of being a full time psychology\r\ngraduate student existing on a very low budget, I was experiencing I\r\nvery frustrating relationship with a young man that left me\r\nconstantly off center and confused.\r\n\r\nA biopsy was promptly performed. The university hospital's SOP\r\nrequired that three pathologists make an independent decision about\r\nthe nature of a tumor before proceeding with radical surgery. Two of\r\nthe pathologist agreed that my tumor was malignant, which\r\nrepresented the required majority vote. But the surgeon removed only\r\nthe lump, which he said was well encapsulated and for some reason\r\ndid not proceed with a radical mastectomy. These days many surgeons\r\nroutinely limit themselves to lumpectomies.\r\n\r\nI never did find out why I awakened from general anesthetic with two\r\nbreasts, but I have since supposed that due to my tender age the\r\nsurgeon was reluctant to disfigure me without at least asking me for\r\npermission, or giving me some time to prepare psychologically. When\r\nI came out of anesthesia he told me that the lump was malignant, and\r\nthat he had removed it, and that he needed to do a radical\r\nmastectomy to improve my prognosis over the next few years. He asked\r\nme to think it over, but he signed me up on his surgery list for the\r\nfollowing Monday.\r\n\r\nI did think it over and found I was profoundly annoyed at the idea\r\nof being treated like I was just a statistic, so I decided that I\r\nwould be unique. I made a firm decision that I would be well and\r\nstay well--and I was for the next fifteen years. The decision healed\r\nme.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 37 I had a recurrence. At the time I had in residence\r\nEthyl and Marge, the two far-gone breast cancer cases I already told\r\nyou about. I also had in residence a young woman with a breast tumor\r\nwho had not undergone any medical treatment, not even a lumpectomy.\r\n(I will relate her case in detail shortly.) I was too identified\r\nemotionally with helping these three, overly-empathetic due to my\r\nown history. I found myself taking on their symptoms and their pain.\r\nI went so far into sympathy as to grow back my tumor--just as it had\r\nthe first time--a lump mushroomed from nothing to the size of a goose\r\negg in only three weeks in exactly the same place as the first one.\r\nJust out of curiosity I went in for a needle biopsy. Once again it\r\nwas judged to be malignant, and I got the same pressure from the\r\nsurgeon for immediate surgery. This time, however, I had an\r\nalternative system of healing that I believed in. So I went home,\r\ncontinued to care for my very sick residents, and began to work on\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I had to confront about myself was that I was being\r\na compassionate fool. I needed to learn how to maintain my own\r\npersonal boundaries, and clearly delineate what stuff in my mind and\r\nmy body was really mine and what was another's. I needed to apply\r\ncertain mental techniques of self-protection known to and practiced\r\nby many healers. I knew beyond doubt that I had developed\r\nsympathetic breast cancer because a similar phenomena had happened\r\nto me before. Once, when I had previously been working on a person\r\nwith very severe back pain with hands-on techniques, I suddenly had\r\nthe pain, and the client was totally free of it. So I protected\r\nmyself when working with sick people. I would wash my hands and arms\r\nthoroughly with cold water, or with water and vinegar after contact.\r\nI would shake off their \"energy,\" have a cold shower, walk bare foot\r\non the grass, and visualize myself well with intact boundaries.\r\nThese prophylaxes had been working for me, but I was particularly\r\nvulnerable to people with breast cancer.\r\n\r\nI also began detoxification dieting, took more supplements, and used\r\nacupressure and reflexology as my main lines of attack. My healing\r\ndiet consisted of raw food exclusively. I allowed myself fruits (not\r\nsweet fruits) and vegetables (including a lot of raw cabbage because\r\nvegetables in the cabbage family such as cauliflower and broccoli\r\nare known to have a healing effect on cancer), raw almonds, raw\r\napricot kernels, and some sprouted grains and legumes. I drank\r\ndiluted carrot juice, and a chlorophyll drink made up of wheat grass\r\nand barley green and aloe vera juice. I took echinaechia, red\r\nclover, and fenugreek seeds. I worked all the acupuncture points on\r\nmy body that strengthen the immune system, including the thymus\r\ngland, lymph nodes, and spleen. I also worked the meridians, and\r\nreflex points for the liver, and large intestine. I massaged the\r\nbreast along the natural lines of lymphatic drainage from the area.\r\n\r\nLast, and of great importance, I knew that the treatment would work,\r\nand that the tumor would quickly disappear. It did vanish totally in\r\nthree months. It would have gone away quicker if I had water fasted,\r\nbut I was unable to do this because I needed physical strength to\r\ncare for my resident patients and family.\r\n\r\nEighteen years have passed since that episode, and I have had no\r\nfurther reappearance of breast tumors. At age 55 I still have all my\r\nbody parts, and have had no surgery except the original lumpectomy.\r\nMany, viewing my muscles and athletic performance, would say my\r\nhealth is exceptional but I know my own frailties and make sure I do\r\nnot aggravate them. I still have exactly the same organ deficiencies\r\nas other cancer patients and must keep a very short leash on my\r\nlifestyle.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason I wanted to make my life very short, all I would\r\nhave to do would be to abandon my diet, stop taking supplements, eat\r\nred meat and ice cream every day and be unhappy about something.\r\nIncidentally, I have had many residential clients with breast cancer\r\nsince then, and have not taken on their symptoms, so I can assume\r\nthat I have safely passed that hurdle.\r\n\r\nI've helped dozens of cases of simple breast cancer where my\r\ntreatment began before the cancer broadly spread. Kelly's case was\r\nnot the easiest of this group, nor the hardest. Sometimes there was\r\nlymphatic involvement that the medical doctors had not yet treated\r\nin any way. All but one of my early-onset breast cancer cases\r\nrecovered. I believe those are far better results than achieved by\r\nAMA treatment.\r\n\r\nBefore I crow too much, let me stress that every one of these women\r\nwas a good candidate for recovery--under 40 years old, ambulatory and\r\ndid not feel very sick. And most importantly, every one of them had\r\nreceived no other debilitating medical treatment except a needle\r\nbiopsy or simple lumpectomy. None of these women had old tumors\r\n(known about for more than six months) and none of the tumors were\r\nenormous (nothing larger than a walnut).\r\n\r\nClearly, this group is not representative of the average breast\r\ncancer case. Hygienic therapy for cancer is a radical idea these\r\ndays and tends to attract younger people, or older, desperate people\r\nwho have already been through the works. In every one of my simple\r\ncases the tumors were reabsorbed by the body during the thirty days\r\nof water fasting and the client left happy.\r\n\r\nExcept one. I think I should describe this unsuccessful case, this\r\n\"dirty case,\" so my readers get a more balanced idea of how fearsome\r\ncancer really isn't if the sick person can clearly resolve to get\r\nbetter and has no problem about achieving wellness.\r\n\r\nMarie was an artisan and musician from Seattle who grew up back East\r\nin an upper-middle class dysfunctional family. She was in her late\r\ntwenties. She had been sexually abused by an older brother, was\r\nhighly reactive, and had never been able to communicate honestly\r\nwith anyone except her lesbian lover (maybe, about some things).\r\n\r\nThree years prior to coming to see me Marie had been medically\r\ndiagnosed as having breast cancer and had been advised to have\r\nimmediate surgery. She ignored this advice; Marie never told her\r\nfriends, said nothing to her family and tried to conceal it from her\r\nlover because she did not want to disrupt their life together.\r\n\r\nOn her own, she did begin eating a Macrobiotic diet. In spite of\r\nthis diet, the tumor grew, but grew very slowly. After two years the\r\ntumor was discovered by her lover, who after a year of exhausting\r\nand upsetting arguments, forced Marie to seek treatment. Since Marie\r\nadamantly refused to go the conventional medical route, she ended up\r\non my doorstep as a compromise.\r\n\r\nBy this time the tumor was the size of a fist and had broken through\r\nthe skin of the left breast. It was very ugly, very hard.\r\nBiokinesiology showed the usual deadly triangle and other associated\r\norgan weakneses typical of cancer. Marie began fasting on water with\r\ncolonics and poultices and bodywork and counseling and supplements.\r\nAt the end of the water fast, Marie looked much healthier, with\r\nclear eyes and clear skin and had a sort of shine about her, but the\r\ntumor had only receded enough for the skin to close over it; it was\r\nstill large, and very hard. To fully heal, Marie probably needed at\r\nleast two more water fasts of equal length interspersed with a few\r\nmonths on a raw food diet. But she lacked the personal toughness to\r\nconfront another fast in the near future. Nor was she emotionally up\r\nto what she regarded as the deprivation of a long-term raw foods\r\nhealing diet.\r\n\r\nSo I advised her to seek other treatment. Still unwilling to accept\r\nstandard medical management of her case, Marie chose to go to the\r\nPhilippines to have \"psychic surgery.\" She was excited and\r\noptimistic about this; I was interested myself because I was dubious\r\nabout this magical procedure; if Marie went I would have a chance to\r\nsee the results (if any) on a person I was very familiar with. Marie\r\nhad her tickets and was due to leave in days when her lover, against\r\nMarie's directly-stated wishes, called her parents and informed them\r\nof what was happening.\r\n\r\nThe parents had known nothing of Marie's cancer and were shocked,\r\nupset, outraged! They had not known Marie was a lesbian, much less\r\nthat their daughter was flirting with (from their view) obvious\r\nquackery. Their daughter needed immediate saving and her parents and\r\nbrother (the one who had abused her) flew to Oregon and surprisingly\r\nappeared the next day in a state of violent rage. They threatened\r\nlawsuits, police, incarceration, they threatened to have their\r\ndaughter civilly committed as unable to take care of herself. They\r\nthought everything Marie had done for the last three years was my\r\nfault. I was lucky to stay out of jail. Of course, all of this was\r\nwhy Marie had not told them in the first place; she had wanted to\r\navoid this kind of a scene.\r\n\r\nMarie did not have enough personal integrity to withstand the\r\ndomination of her immediate family. They put her in a hospital,\r\nwhere Marie had a radical mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation.\r\nAssured that they had done everything that should have been done,\r\nthe self-righteous parents went back home. Marie never recovered\r\nfrom chemotherapy and radiation. She died in the hospital surrounded\r\nby her lesbian friends who took dedicated, ever-so-sympathetic turns\r\nmaintaining an emotional round-the-clock vigil.\r\n\r\nMarie's death was partly my fault. She was an early case of mine. At\r\nthe time I did not yet understand the total effect of lack of ethics\r\nand irresponsibility on illness. Had Marie really wanted to live in\r\nthe first place, she would have sought treatment three years\r\nearlier. In our counseling sessions she always evaded this question\r\nand I had not been wise enough to pin her down with my knee on her\r\nchest and make her answer up. Marie had too many secrets from\r\neverybody and was never fully honest in any of her relationships,\r\nincluding with me. I think she only came to Great Oaks at her\r\nlover's insistence and to the day she died was trying to pretend\r\nthat nothing was wrong.\r\n\r\nAll Marie really wanted from her life was to be loved and have a lot\r\nof loving attention. In the end, her dramatic death scene gave her\r\nthat, which is probably why she manifested cancer and kept it and\r\neventually, died from it.\r\n\r\nThe name for this game is \"secondary gain.\" A lot of sick people are\r\nplaying it. Their illness lets them win their deepest desire; they\r\nget love, attention, revenge, sympathy, complete service, pampering,\r\ncreate guilt in others. When sick people receive too much secondary\r\ngain they never get well.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest things about being a healer is that one\r\naccumulates an ever-enlarging series of dirty, failed cases like\r\nthis one. It is depressing and makes a person want to quit\r\ndoctoring. Whenever I get involved with a case I really want them to\r\nget better. My life is put entirely out of joint for several months\r\ndealing with a residential faster. My schedule is disrupted; my\r\nfamily life suffers; my personal health suffers. No amount of mere\r\nmoney could pay for this. And then some of these people go and waste\r\nall my help to accomplish some discreditable secret agenda that they\r\nhave never really admitted to themselves or others.\r\n\r\nConstant Complaints\r\n\r\nAlice was a middle-aged woman who couldn't understand why she had\r\nalways felt tired, even when she was young. Her life had been this\r\nway ever since she could remember. Most puzzling to her was why her\r\nlife was so Job-like. She did everything the proper way. Doing\r\nthings correctly was important to her, and fitted her Puritan\r\nbackground. Alice supported all the right causes, did good works,\r\nwas active in a Unitarian church and bought all her food at the\r\nhealthfood store--and made sure it was organically grown.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of Alice's righteous living, her existence was a\r\ntreadmill of constant, minor complaints. She was constantly\r\nexhausted, so much so she had difficulty getting up in the morning\r\nand feared she might have chronic fatigue syndrome (whatever that\r\nis). Alice suffered bouts of depression over thoughts like these,\r\nand had many acute illnesses like colds that hung on interminably\r\nand would not go away. She had a constant post-nasal drip. Though\r\nshe enjoyed life, her body was a millstone around her neck.\r\n\r\nI've had a lot of clients exactly like Alice. Sometimes they\r\ncomplain of headaches; sometimes constant yeast or bladder\r\ninfections. Whatever the complaints, the symptoms are rarely severe\r\nenough to classify themselves as someone who is seriously ill, but\r\ntheir symptoms rarely go away and they almost never feel good.\r\nMedical doctors rarely find anything wrong with them, though they\r\nwill frequently prescribe an antibiotic to treat a somewhat constant\r\ninfection, or an antihistamine for sinus symptoms. Getting a new\r\nprescription drug makes the complaint go away for a short time until\r\ntheir resistance is lowered again and the very same complaint\r\nreturns. These people frequently depend on over the counter pills\r\nand are routinely prescribed sleeping remedies and antidepressants.\r\nIf instead of this route they will but take my medicine they are\r\nusually easy to fix and afterwards are amazed that it was all that\r\nsimple and that so much of their life has been less than it could\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\nAlice had been through the medical doctor route. She had become\r\nquite familiar with antibiotics for her colds and flu, and also took\r\nsynthetic thyroid hormone--the doctor had diagnosed her fatigue as\r\nbeing caused by an underactive thyroid, which was partly correct--but\r\nthe thyroid medication didn't give her much more energy. Alice had\r\nbeen supporting this medical doctor in grand style for over thirty\r\nyears but never obtained the relief she sought.\r\n\r\nI put Alice through my usual two hour first-time-visit thorough\r\nanalysis. For two weeks before coming to see me she had saved tiny\r\nsamples of everything she ate, wrapped them in plastic film,\r\ncarefully labeled, and put them in the freezer. Along with these\r\nfood samples and a typed list of all these foods, she brought a big\r\nbox full of her condiments, herb teas, vitamins, spices,\r\nprescription medications, over the counter drugs, oils, grains,\r\nbreads, crackers and small samples of her usual fresh vegetables and\r\nfruits. Even her water. Her entire kitchen! By biokinesiology we\r\nproceeded to test all of her foods for allergic reactions. I also\r\ntested the integrity of her organs and glands and in the process,\r\ngot a detailed medical history and list of her complaints.\r\n\r\nAlice had exhausted adrenals, and they probably had been that way\r\nfor thirty years. Her pancreas was now too weak to digest the\r\nlegumes that made up a large part of her vegetarian diet. She was\r\nallergic to wheat, soy, and dairy products and had especially been\r\neating dairy in the mistaken notion that it was necessary to keep up\r\nher protein intake. Really very typical. So many health food store\r\nshoppers these days mistakenly believe that, because they are\r\nvegetarian and do not eat meat, they especially need to boost their\r\nprotein intake with dairy and soy. Unfortunately, so many North\r\nAmericans are highly allergic to dairy and unfortunately, soy\r\nproducts are as hard or harder to digest than cooked meats.\r\n\r\nAlice was especially shocked to discover that she was allergic to\r\nsuch foods as cabbage family vegetables, alfalfa sprouts and citrus.\r\nMost people don't think that anyone could be allergic to something\r\nas healthy as alfalfa sprouts. The doctor was right about one thing;\r\nher thyroid was underperforming. He had not noticed that her heart\r\nwas weak.\r\n\r\nMedical doctors rarely discover an organ weakness until that organ\r\nactually begins to catastrophically fail. A busy honest doctor will\r\nusually tell the complaining patient there is nothing wrong with\r\nthem: go home, take two aspirin, accept the fact that your body is\r\nnot perfect and don't worry about it. A hungry doctor will be\r\ndelighted to perform countless lab tests, seeking any possible\r\nreason for the complaint. This can go on as long as the patient has\r\nmoney or as long as the insurance company will pay. They rarely find\r\nanything \"wrong\" and the patient is far better off if the doctor\r\ndoesn't discover something \"serious\" to treat because their\r\ntreatment may carry with it consequences far more severe than the\r\ncomplaint. For example, I have seen dozens of people whose lives\r\nwere virtually ruined after surgical treatment for chronic back\r\npain.\r\n\r\nBiokinesiology is actually a far more sensitive system of analysis\r\nthan lab tests. It picks up weaknesses at a very early stage so\r\ntotal organ failure can be prevented. Rarely will any of the organ\r\nweaknesses I discover be confirmed by a medical doctor. First I put\r\nAlice on a six week cleanse. She did one week on fresh, raw food;\r\none week on dilute carrot juice with some green leafy vegetables\r\njuice too; one week on water fasting; and then she repeated the\r\nseries. After six weeks of detoxification, I gave Alice a life\r\nextension megavitamin formula, discovered she could not handle the\r\nacid form of vitamin C (that she had already been taking) and had\r\nher start on protomorphogens to rebuild her weakened endocrine\r\nsystem, her exhausted adrenals and weak pancreas. She also began\r\ntaking pancreatic enzymes when she ate vegetable protein. She was\r\nput on a maintenance diet that eliminated foods she was allergic to;\r\nthe diet primarily consisted of whole grains, nuts, cooked and raw\r\nvegetables, and raw fruits. On her maintenance diet Alice had a\r\nprofound resurgence of energy and rediscovered a sense of well-being\r\nshe had not known for decades. She began to feel like she had when\r\nshe was a child. Her constant sinus drip was gone. She was able to\r\nstop taking synthetic thyroid hormones and instead, supported her\r\nendocrine system with protomorphogens.\r\n\r\nA Rampaging Infection\r\n\r\nAt the age of 40, John, an old bohemian client of mine, came into a\r\nmoderate inheritance and went \"native\" in the Fiji Islands in the\r\nSouth Pacific. He spent about four months hanging out with the\r\nlocals. Life there was so much fun that John completely forgot that\r\nhis body was actually rather delicate, that many of his organs were\r\nweak, and that to feel good, he had to live a fairly simon-pure\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBut the jovial, accepting, devil-may-care Fijians enjoyed a constant\r\nparty, even more so because John's money allowed the Fijians to\r\nmanifest powerful, tropical, home-grown strains of recreational\r\nherbs to smoke in abundance, beer and rum and worse, the Fijians\r\n(and John) constantly used a very toxic though only mildly-euphoric\r\nnarcotic called kava, something Europeans usually have no genetic\r\nresistance to. The Fijians (and John) also ate a lot of\r\nfreshly-caught fish fried in grease, well-salted, and huge,\r\nbrain-numbing bowls of greasy starches, foods that they call i'coi,\r\nor \"real food\" as opposed to things like fruit and vegetables that\r\naren't real food because they don't knock you to the floor for hours\r\ntrying to digest them in a somnambulant doze.\r\n\r\nJohn miraculously kept up with this party for a few months and then,\r\nwhile scuba diving, got some small coral scratches on his leg. These\r\ngot infected. The infections got worse. Soon he had several huge,\r\nsuppurating, ulcerous sores on his legs and worse, the infections\r\nbecame systemic and began spreading rapidly. He was running a fever\r\nand was in considerable pain. So John booked an emergency ticket\r\nhome and fled to find Doctor Isabelle. When I met his plane he was\r\nrolled out in a wheelchair, unable to walk because of pain and\r\nswelling in his legs.\r\n\r\nJohn was violently opposed to ordinary medical treatment; he\r\nespecially would not have taken antibiotics even if he had died\r\nwithout them because previous courses of antibiotics had been the\r\nprecipitant of life-threatening conditions that first brought John\r\nto my care. John used his last strength to get to me because he knew\r\nthat had a hospital gotten its clutches on him the medical doctors\r\nwould have done exactly as they pleased.\r\n\r\nI gave John a colonic, a gentle, mental spanking, and put him to bed\r\nwithout any supper. He started water fasting and did colonics every\r\nday. He began gobbling vitamin C (as calcium ascorbate) a few grams\r\nevery hour. I put huge poultices on his sores made of clay and\r\nchopped lawn grass (we needed a week or so before a tray of wheat\r\ngrass would be ready). John's sores were amazing. Every day a new\r\none seemed to appear on a different part of the body. The old ones\r\nkept getting bigger and deeper. The largest original ones were about\r\nthree inches in diameter, smelled horribly and had almost eaten the\r\nflesh down to the bone. His pain was severe; there was no position\r\nJohn could assume that didn't irritate one sore or another, and it\r\nwas a good thing my house was remote because John frequently\r\nrelieved his pain by screaming. John was never delirious, but he was\r\nalways original. He did not have to scream, but enjoyed its relief\r\nand howled quite dramatically. I wore earplugs.\r\n\r\nAfter about two weeks of water fasting, John counted up the total of\r\nhis sores. There were forty three. Seven or eight of them were\r\nenormous, two or three inches in diameter and well into the flesh,\r\nbut the last ones to appear were shallow, small and stayed small.\r\nAfter that point no more new ones showed up and the body began to\r\nmake visible headway against the infection. Very slowly and then\r\nmore and more rapidly, the sores began to close up and heal from the\r\nedges. John's fever began to drop. And he had less pain. I should\r\nmention that John brought an extremely virulent and aggressive\r\npathogenic organism into our house to which we Americans had no\r\nresistance. Both my husband and I were attacked where the skin had\r\nbeen broken. However, unlike John, in our cases, our healthy bodies\r\nimmediately walled-off the organism and the small, reddened\r\npustules, though painful, did not grow and within a week, had been\r\nconquered by our immune systems. And after that we had an immunity.\r\n\r\nAfter about three weeks of his fasting we were thoroughly tired of\r\nhearing John's cathartic howls, tired of nursing a sick person. We\r\nneeded a break. John at this point could walk a bit and was feeling\r\na lot better. John had previously water fasted for 30 days and knew\r\nthe drill very well. So we stocked up the vitamin C bottle by his\r\nbed and went to town for the weekend to stay in a motel and see a\r\nmovie. As they say in the Canadian backwoods, we were bushed.\r\n\r\nJohn had promised to be good. But as soon as we left he decided that\r\nsince he felt so very much better, he could break his fast. He knew\r\nhow to do this and fortunately for him, (it was very much premature\r\nfor John to eat) did it more or less correctly, only eating small\r\nquantities of raw fruits and vegetables. But by the time we got back\r\nhome three days later, John had relapsed. The pain was rapidly\r\ngetting much worse; the sores were growing again and a few small new\r\nones appeared. Dr. Isabelle again took away his food and gave him\r\nanother verbal spanking a little more severe than the one he'd had a\r\nfew weeks earlier and put him to bed again without his supper.\r\n\r\nAfter two more weeks on water, John had gained a great deal on the\r\nsores. They were filling in and weren't oozing pus, looked clean and\r\nthe new forming meat looked a healthy pink instead of purple-black.\r\nBut John had been very slender to start with and by now he was\r\ngetting near the end of his food reserves. He probably couldn't have\r\nfasted on water for more than one more week without starvation\r\nbeginning. But this time, when he broke his fast, it was under close\r\nsupervision. I gave him dilute juice only, introduced other\r\nsustenance very cautiously and made absolutely sure that\r\nreintroducing nourishment would not permit the organism to gain.\r\nThis time it didn't. John's own immune system, beefed up by fasting,\r\nhad conquered a virulent organism that could have easily killed him.\r\n\r\nBefore the era of antibiotics, before immunizations to the common\r\nchildhood illnesses, people frequently died of infections as\r\nvirulent as the one that attacked John. They usually died because\r\nthey \"ate to keep up their strength.\" Most of these deaths were\r\nunnecessary, caused by ignorance and poor nursing care. For example,\r\nstandard medical treatment for typhoid fever used to consist of\r\nspoon-fed milk--sure to kill all but the strongest constitution. Even\r\nwithout the assistance of massive doses of vitamin C, if people\r\nwould but fast away infections they could cure themselves of almost\r\nall of them with little danger, without the side effects of\r\nantibiotics or creating mutated antibiotic-resistant strains of\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\nDr. John Tilden, a hygienist who practiced in the '20s, before the\r\nera of antibiotics, routinely fasted patients with infectious\r\nillnesses. Supporting the sick body with wise nursing, he routinely\r\nhealed scarlet fever, whopping cough, typhoid, typhus, pneumonia,\r\nperitonitis, Rocky Mountain fever, tuberculosis, gonorrhea,\r\nsyphilis, cholera, and rheumatic fever. The one common infection he\r\ncould not cure was diphtheria involving the throat. (Tilden,\r\nImpaired Health, Vol. II).\r\n\r\nRecently, medical gerontologists have discovered another reason that\r\nfasting heals infections. One body function that deteriorates during\r\nthe aging process is the production of growth hormone so the effects\r\nof growth hormone have been studied. This hormone also stimulates\r\nthe body to heal wounds and burns, repair broken bones, generally\r\nreplace any tissues that have been destroyed and, growth hormone\r\nstimulates the immune response. Growth hormone also maintains muscle\r\ntone and its presence generally slows the aging process.\r\n\r\nGrowth hormone might make a wonderful life-extension supplement; on\r\nit a middle-aged person might readily maintain the muscle tone of\r\nyouth while slowing aging in general. Unfortunately, growth hormone\r\ncannot at this time be inexpensively synthesized and is still far\r\ntoo costly to be used therapeutically except to prevent dwarfism.\r\nHowever, any technique that encourages a body to produce more of\r\nthis hormone would be of great interest to life extensionists.\r\n\r\nThe body only produces growth hormone at certain times and only when\r\ncertain nutrients are present in the blood. Gerontologists call\r\nthese nutrients \"precursors.\" The precursors are two essential amino\r\nacids, argenine and ornithine and certain vitamins such as C and B6.\r\nBut having the precursors present is not enough. Growth hormone is\r\nonly manufactured under certain, specific circumstances: for about\r\none hour immediately after going to sleep and then only if the blood\r\nsupply is rich with argenine and ornithine but contains few other\r\namino acids; it is also manufactured during heavy aerobic exercise\r\nthat goes on for more than thirty minutes; and growth hormone is\r\nproduced at an accelerated rate when fasting. (Pearson and Shaw,\r\n1983). I did not know this when I was fasting John, but now, I would\r\ngive argenine and ornithine to someone with a serious infection as\r\nwell as massive quantities of vitamin C.\r\n\r\nChronic Back Pain\r\n\r\nBarry was a carpenter who couldn't afford to lose work because he\r\nwas unable to bend or twist or lift. He frequently had bouts of\r\nsevere back pain that made working almost impossible. Upon analysis\r\nby biokinesiology I found that he had a major problem with large\r\nintestine weakness and secondarily, adrenal weakness.\r\n\r\nConstipation frequently causes back pain. The muscles of the back\r\nhave nerve pathway connections to the large intestines; weakness in\r\nthe intestine causes weakness of the back and makes it prone to\r\ninjury. But the problem is the intestine, not the back. And the only\r\nway to make the back stay better is to heal the intestine. Many\r\nathletes have very similar problems. For example, they get knee\r\ninjuries and think there is something wrong with their knee. Or they\r\nget shoulder injuries and think their shoulder is weak. These people\r\nare only half right. Yes, their knee or their shoulder is weak. But\r\nit could become strong and almost uninjurable if the underlying\r\ncause of the weakness is corrected.\r\n\r\nThe knee for example, has nerve pathway connections to the adrenal\r\nglands and kidneys. The shoulder has similar connections to the\r\nthyroid. The foot is weakened by the bladder. The treatment should\r\nfirst be on the weakened gland or organ and secondarily, on the\r\ndamaged muscle tissue. I have solved numerous sports-related knee\r\nproblems with protomorphogens for the adrenals and elimination of\r\nfood allergies that make the adrenals work overtime. I have fixed\r\nbad shoulders by rebuilding the thyroid.\r\n\r\nIn Barry's case, it was the intestine. I asked him about his bowel\r\nfunction and he said that he was never constipated, had \"a daily\r\nbowel movement without a lot of straining.\" But having given some\r\n6,000 colonics, I knew better. There should have been no straining;\r\nBarry was trying very hard to be regular--he should not have had to\r\neffort. Fortunately, it struck him as true that he needed to\r\ndetoxify and I managed to convince him to water fast. He probably\r\nfigured, why not since he couldn't work anyway. Barry was a tall,\r\nskinny man to start with and you would think he hardly carried any\r\nfat at all, but he fasted on water for 30 days, receiving a colonic\r\nevery day, while I did bodywork on his damaged back. He sure was\r\nconstipated and couldn't deny the evidence that floated by through\r\nthe sight tube of the colonic machine. By the end of the fast his\r\ncolon was fairly repaired and free of old fecal material. And Barry\r\nhad become a tall, gaunt-looking guy who had lost about 20 pounds\r\nyou wouldn't think he had to spare.\r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks of careful weaning back on to food, Barry felt\r\npretty good, terrific even. He had no back pain and found out for\r\nthe first time what not being constipated meant. It no longer took\r\n\"not very much effort\" to move his bowels; they moved themselves.\r\nThat was ten years ago. A few months ago, Barry looked me up, just\r\nto say thanks and to let me know that he had not had any more back\r\nproblems and had generally felt good because he had more or less\r\nstayed on the improved diet I had instructed him about during his\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nPainful Menstruation\r\n\r\nElsie was twenty. She came to see me because I had helped Elsie's\r\nmother overcome breast cancer many years earlier. Elsie began to\r\nhave very painful periods with profuse bleeding and abdominal pain.\r\nHer nutrition had been generally good because her mother couldn't\r\nsurvive on the average American diet and had long ago converted her\r\nfamily to vegetarianism. And like her mother, Elsie had been taking\r\nvitamins for many years.\r\n\r\nA medical doctor diagnosed Elsie as having endometriosis, meaning,\r\nthe lining of her uterus had migrated to the fallopian tubes, where\r\nit continued to bleed regularly into the abdominal cavity, following\r\nthe same hormonal cycle as the endometritial tissue that lines the\r\nuterus. The doctor offered to try hormonal manipulation and if this\r\nproved unsuccessful, offered a hysterectomy. That would certainly\r\neliminate the symptoms!\r\n\r\nBut Elsie did not wish to eliminate her ability to have children and\r\npreferred not to risk throwing her hormones off balance. So she came\r\nto me. My analysis showed that she had weak ovaries and weak uterus.\r\nThese were secondary to a toxic colon, toxic because she had a weak\r\ngall bladder and weak pancreas that reduced her digestive capacity\r\nand turned her improperly combined Organic, vegetarian legume-rich\r\ndiet into toxemia. Checking her foods for allergies I discovered the\r\nnormal pattern: Elsie was intolerant to dairy, wheat, eggs, corn,\r\nsoy and concentrated sugars.\r\n\r\nBeing no stranger to fasting (her mother had fasted at length ten\r\nyears previously) Elsie undertook a 30 day cleanse on vegetable\r\njuice with daily enemas, taking vitamins in powdered form. After the\r\nfast I put her on protomorphogens for her reproductive organs and\r\npancreas. The gall bladder had healed by itself during fasting--gall\r\nbladders usually heal easily. Her maintenance diet included using\r\npancreatic enzyme supplements when eating vegetable proteins and\r\nElsie eliminated most fats so her gall bladder would not be\r\nstressed. The fasting also overcame her allergic reactions to corn\r\nand wheat but she was still unable to handle soy products, eggs or\r\ndairy. After six months Elsie no longer needed protomorphogens, had\r\nno abdominal pain and her periods were normal.\r\n\r\nYou may well be wondering how or why detoxification of the bowels\r\nallowed the body to repair the uterus. The large intestine is a sort\r\nof nest that cradles the reproductive organs, including the ovaries,\r\nuterus, and in the case of the male, the prostate gland. A toxic\r\ncolon is like having one rotten apple in a basket, it contaminates\r\nthe whole batch. Many problems in the abdominal area are caused by a\r\ntoxic colon, including chronic back pain, ovarian cysts,\r\ninfertility, birth abnormalities, bladder infections and bladder\r\ncancer, painful menstruation, fibroids and other benign growths as\r\nwell as malignant ones, and prostatitis or prostate cancer. Detoxing\r\nthe body and cleaning out the colon should be a part of the healing\r\nof all of these conditions.\r\n\r\nIrritable Bowels\r\n\r\nSome peoples' lives don't run smoothly. Jeanne's certainly didn't.\r\nShe was abandoned to raise three little kids on welfare. Her college\r\ndiploma turned out to be useless. Jeanne used to help me at Great\r\nOaks in exchange for treatment. During those early years she had\r\ndone a 30 day juice fast with colonics. Twenty years later at age\r\n60, having survived three children's growing up, surviving the\r\nprofound, enduring loss of one who died as an adult, after starting\r\nup and running a small business that for many years barely paid its\r\nway, and experiencing an uninsured fire that took her house, she\r\nbegan to develop abdominal pains the doctors named \"irritable bowel\r\nsyndrome\" or \"colitis.\" The MD offered antibiotics and\r\nantispasmodics but Jeanne had no insurance, the remedies were\r\nunaffordable. She also retained considerable affinity for natural\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nPrior to these symptoms her diet had been vegetarian, and had\r\nincluded large quantities of raw fruits and vegetables and whole\r\ngrains. But the bran in bread was irritating to her bowels, she\r\ncould no longer digest raw vegetables or most raw fruit.\r\n\r\nJeanne's vital force was low; her healing took time. She started on\r\na long fast supported by powdered vitamins, vegetable broth and herb\r\nteas, but after three weeks was too weak to do her own enemas at\r\nhome and could not shop for vegetables to cook into broth. So she\r\nhad to add one small serving of cooked vegetable per day, usually\r\nbroccoli or steamed kale. This lasted for one more week but Jeanne,\r\nhaving no financial reserves, had to return to work, and needed to\r\nregain energy quickly. Though not totally healed, she progressed to\r\na maintenance diet of cooked grains and vegetables and food\r\nsupplements, very much like a Macrobiotic diet. She felt better for\r\nawhile but wore down again after another stressful year.\r\n\r\nHer abdominal pains gradually returned though this time she noticed\r\nthey were closely associated with her stresses. About one year after\r\nending her first fast, as soon as she could arrange to take time\r\noff, she began another. This time to avoid extreme weakness, she\r\ntook vegetable broth from the outset, as well as small amounts of\r\ncarrot juice and one small serving of cooked vegetable a day for\r\nthree weeks. Again, this rest allowed the digestive tract to heal\r\nand the pain went away. She returned to her Macrobiotic diet with\r\nselected raw foods that she could now handle without irritating her\r\nbowel.\r\n\r\nShe was now healthier then she had been in many years. With improved\r\nenergy and a more positive attitude, Jeanne returned to University\r\nat age 65 and obtained a teaching certificate. Now she is making\r\ngood money, doing work she enjoys for the first time in 35 years. I\r\nhope she has a long and happy life. She is entitled to one!\r\n\r\nA Collection of Gallbladders\r\n\r\nGallbladder cases are rather ho-hum to me; they are quick to respond\r\nto hygienic treatment and easy to resolve. I've fixed lots of them.\r\nBut an inflamed gallbladder is in no way ho-hum to the person\r\nafflicted with it. I've been frequently told that there are no worse\r\npains a body can create than an inflamed gallbladder or the\r\nsensations accompanying the passing of a gall stone. I hear from\r\nkidney patients that passing a kidney stone is worse but I've never\r\nhad a patient who experienced both kinds of stones to give me an\r\nhonest comparative evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe only thing dangerous about simple gallbladder problems is\r\nignoring them (between the bouts of severe pain they can cause)\r\nbecause then the inflamed gallbladder can involve the liver. I\r\nalready told the story of how my own mother lost half her liver this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe condition is usually caused by a combination of hereditary\r\ntendency, general toxemia, and/or a high-fat diet, especially one\r\nhigh in animal fats. The liver makes bile that is stored in the\r\ngallbladder, to be released on demand into the small intestine to\r\ndigest fat. A toxic, overloaded liver makes irritating\r\nsediment-containing bile that inflames the gallbladder and forms\r\nstones. A high-fat diet forces the liver to make even more of this\r\nirritant.\r\n\r\nA toxic, overloaded, inflamed, blocked gallbladder is capable of\r\ncausing an enormous array of symptoms that can seem to have no\r\nconnection at all to their cause. In part these same symptoms are\r\ncaused by a toxic, constipated colon that, in part, got that way\r\nbecause of poor fat digestion over a long time. These symptoms\r\ninclude: severe back pain; headache; bloating; burping; nausea;\r\ninsomnia; intestinal gas; generalized aches and pains.\r\n\r\nMedical doctors used to remove a troublesome gallbladder without\r\nhesitation; it was an organ they considered to be highly\r\ndispensable. Without one, the bile duct takes over as a bladder but\r\nits capacity is much smaller so the person's ability to digest fats\r\nhas been permanently crippled, leading to increased toxemia and\r\nearlier aging if fats are not eliminated from the diet. These days\r\nthe medicos have a new, less invasive procedure to eliminate stones;\r\nthey are vibrated and broken-up by ultrasonics without major\r\nsurgery. Inflamed gallbladders are usually removed because\r\ngallbladder inflammations resist treatment by antibiotics.\r\n\r\nThere are several very effective natural gallbladder remedies. The\r\nbest is a three week fast, taking the juice of one or two lemons\r\nevery day, along with colonics. The lemon juice tends to clear the\r\nbile duct. The fast allows the gallbladder to heal from\r\ninflammation. In cases that aren't too severe I have had very good\r\nresults simply eliminating fats from the diet and using a food\r\nsupplement derived from beet tops called AF Betafood. However, in\r\nall these cases, once the gallbladder is no longer \"acting up,\" the\r\nperson must stay on a low fat diet. Any fats they do eat must be\r\nvegetable and in small quantities.\r\n\r\nBy healing their gallbladders and cleansing their colons, several of\r\nmy clients have resolved severe, debilitating back pain, pain so\r\nsevere that the suffers were becoming bedridden. Medical doctors\r\ndon't associate gallbladder disease with back pain.\r\n\r\nThe Frightening Heart\r\n\r\nHeart disease is one of the major causes of death among North\r\nAmericans. It evokes images of resuscitation, of desperate races\r\nagainst time, trying to restart an arrested heart before the brain\r\ndies. It makes people think of horribly expensive surgery, last\r\nwills and testaments, terrible, paralyzing pain. Heart disease is a\r\ngreat profit center for the medical profession.\r\n\r\nMost heart problems are very easy to fix by holistic approaches,\r\neven many hereditary weaknesses and malfunctions can be healed, if\r\nthe work is done before too much organic damage occurs. But it\r\nrarely is easy to get the people to take the necessary medicine;\r\neverything in their lives must change--and fast.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, people with heart problems must rapidly reach and\r\nmaintain normal weight. This can be done by fasting or by dietary\r\nchange, usually by eliminating all fats, sugars and refined\r\nstarches. Alcohol and tobacco must instantly and forever become only\r\npast memories. It is almost as essential to eliminate flesh protein\r\nfoods and dairy. Should that prove entirely too painful, fish in\r\nsmall quantities and only one or two times a week is tolerable.\r\n\r\nFor starters, a long fast, especially one involving lots of bed\r\nrest, is ideal. This gives the heart a chance to heal while the body\r\nweight is adjusted. A period of intense rest even without water\r\nfasting will accomplish almost as much. Even someone with the\r\npotential for heart disease who has not yet had a heart attack would\r\nbe well-served to spend a month in bed, losing weight on juice, or\r\nsitting in a rocker on the porch eating only raw foods. After the\r\nweight is down to normal or close to normal and the heart tests\r\nstronger, an exercise program should be started.\r\n\r\nExercise has to become a religion. A daily aerobic program must be\r\nstarted on a carefully managed gradient, using the pulse rate as an\r\nregulator, at first raising their maximum heart rate to a point just\r\nbelow 150 percent of its resting pulse and keeping it there for\r\nthirty minutes. One can walk, jog, ride a bicycle or use an exercise\r\nmachine. Actually, everyone should do this, even those with no heart\r\nproblems. My husband, who hates the boredom of exercise, enjoys a\r\nski machine in front of the TV while the stock market program is on.\r\nHe finds the TV interesting enough that he pays no attention to his\r\nworkout. Daily aerobic exercise will strengthen the heart, gradually\r\nslowing the heart's resting pulse rate, indicating that the heart\r\nhas become much stronger, pumping more blood with each pulse. As the\r\nresting pulse drops the exercising heartbeat can be increased to\r\ndouble the resting rate.\r\n\r\nHighly aggressive, competitive, stress-oriented people have to give\r\nup being adrenaline junkies and learn to relax and assume a\r\nlaid-back approach to living. Or die soon. An adrenaline junkie is\r\nsomeone that enjoys the feeling they get when operating under\r\nstress. Stress and the adrenaline it releases produce a kind of a\r\ndrug-high. Many stressaholics cannot give up their adrenaline\r\naddiction while maintaining their previous employment and\r\nlife-style, even though their life is at stake. In this sense they\r\nare like alcoholics, who should not take employment tending bar. To\r\nsurvive for long these people may have to retire or change\r\nprofessions. Stockbrokers may have to become Organic farmers;\r\njournalists may have to operate a news stand or bookstore, or work\r\npart-time covering the society page and dog shows. Women frequently\r\nturn their family life into a stress-filled drama too.\r\n\r\nWith heart problems a life extension megavitamin program is\r\nessential, even for twenty somethings if they have heart disease.\r\nThe sixty milligrams of Co-Enzyme Q-10 I recommend for the average\r\nmiddle aged person will not be enough for heart cases; they should\r\ntake at least 120 milligrams daily and consider up to 250 mg. This\r\nmuch Q-10 greatly boosts the energy output of the heart on a\r\ncellular level. Vitamin E should also be increased, to between 600\r\nand 2,000 iu daily. I also rebuild diseased hearts with\r\nprotomorphogens; usually they must stay on protomorphogens for the\r\nrest of their lives. Niacin taken several times a day in doses,\r\nsufficient to dilate the capillaries and cause a skin flush (50 to\r\n200 milligrams), increases the blood flow to nourish the heart. The\r\namino acid L. Carnitine is also useful by increasing the energy\r\noutput of the heart much like Co-Enzyme Q-10.\r\n\r\nWhen I put people on this program, the supplements and other\r\nmeasures gradually take effect, and over months the patient begins\r\nto feel enormously better. Inevitably they come to dislike the\r\nside-effects of the various medications their medical doctor has put\r\nthem on and they begin to wean themselves off of heart-stimulating\r\npoisons like digitalis. Another benefit of my program is that\r\ninevitably, blood pressure also drops to a normal range so if they\r\nhave been on blood pressure medication they quit that too. Their\r\ndiuretics also become unnecessary. The money they save more than\r\npays for their supplements and the sense of well-being they feel is\r\nbeyond value.\r\n\r\nOther Kinds Of Cancer\r\n\r\nThere seem to be many other kinds of cancer, at least if you believe\r\nthe medical doctors. They divide up cancers and their treatments by\r\ntheir location in the body and by the type of cancer cells present.\r\nI do not see it that way. To me, a cancer is a cancer is a cancer,\r\nand there is only one kind: it is an immune system collapse,\r\nconsequence of the deadly triangle of weak spleen, thymus and liver,\r\nplus a toxic large intestine and weak pancreas. That organ profile\r\nis found in skin cancer, prostate cancer, leukemia, brain cancer,\r\ncancer of what have you. How fast or how slowly the cells multiply\r\nor spread, where they are located, what the cancer cells look like\r\nin a microscope, these are irrelevant factors compared to the body's\r\nability to conquer the disease. Or die from it.\r\n\r\nIf the body's immune system can stop the growth of the cancers and\r\nbegin to turn them back before the cancer cells impinge\r\ncatastrophically on some vital function, the person can usually\r\nsurvive. Even if the body cannot completely eliminate all the cancer\r\ncells, but regains enough immune function to keep the existing\r\ncancers in permanent check, a person can survive many years with an\r\nexisting, stable cancer without undue pain or discomfort. Still\r\nhaving a non-growing tumor after a long fast indicates that a person\r\nis a lot better than they were before fasting.\r\n\r\nI believe that virtually everyone has cancer cells in their body,\r\njust like viruses and bacteria. But most people do not develop\r\ncancer as a disease because their immune function is strong so these\r\nmisbehaving cells are destroyed as fast as they appear. Mutated,\r\nfreely-multiplying cells are caused by peroxidized fats, by free\r\nradicals in the body, by radiation (there has always been background\r\nradiation on Earth), by chance mutation. There are naturally\r\noccurring highly carcinogenic substances in ordinary foods that are\r\nunavoidable. In fact some of these naturally occurring substances\r\nare far more dangerous than the toxic residues of pesticides in our\r\nfoods. The body is supposed to deal with all these things; they are\r\nall called insults. It is rarely the insult, but the failure of the\r\nbody to eliminate cancerous cells promptly that causes the disease\r\ncalled cancer. So the treatment I recommend for cancer in general is\r\nthe same as the one described for breast cancer cases. Restore the\r\nimmune function.\r\n\r\nHowever, as much as I lack respect for conventional medical cancer\r\ntherapies, I do think surgery can have a useful place in cancer\r\ntreatment along with hygienic methods. Some people just cannot\r\nconfront the lump(s). Or they are so terrified of having a cancer in\r\ntheir body that their emotions suppresses their own immune function.\r\nEven though surgery prompts a cancer to spread more rapidly, without\r\ntheir lumps some cancer patients feel more positive. If surgery is\r\ndone in conjunction with rebuilding the immune system, the body will\r\nprevent new cancers from forming.\r\n\r\nRemoval of a large mass of cancer cells can also lighten the immune\r\nsystem's task. Not having to kill off and reabsorb all those cells\r\none-by-one from a huge cancer mass, the body can better conquer\r\nsmaller groups of cancer cells. And the die-off of large cancers\r\nproduces a lot of toxins, burdening the organs of elimination. This\r\nis an argument for the potential benefit of a lumpectomy. However, I\r\ndo not support mastectomies, or the type of surgery that cause\r\nmassive damage to the body in a foolish attempt to remove every last\r\ncancer cell, as though the cells themselves were the disease.\r\n\r\nSometimes cancer tumors are well-encapsulated, walled off and can be\r\neasily removed without prompting metastasis. This type of tumor may\r\nnot be completely reabsorbed by the body in any case; though the\r\nimmune system may have killed it, an empty shell remains, like a\r\npeanut shell. Sometimes the judgment calls about surgery can get\r\ndicey. When surgery involves removing an organ. I oppose the loss of\r\nuseful body parts.\r\n\r\nI have also known and helped people who believed they couldn't\r\nrecover without radiation and chemotherapy. What people believe is,\r\nis. The emotions generated when a personal reality is suppressed,\r\nignored or invalidated will overwhelm an immune system. I always\r\ntell those people who sincerely believe in it to go ahead with\r\nstandard medical treatment (while I'm privately praying the doctors\r\nwon't cause too much damage). However, when I am supporting a body\r\nwith supplements and dietary reform, have put that body on a\r\nraw-food cleansing diet or even a raw food diet with nuts and grains\r\nthat hardly detoxifies, and then the person has had chemotherapy and\r\nradiation, the medical doctors in attendance are inevitably amazed\r\nthat the side effects are much milder than anticipated, or\r\nnon-existent. And fewer courses of chemotherapy are needed than the\r\ndoctors expected.\r\n\r\nFor example, I worked with a little boy with leukemia. His mother\r\nbrought him to me while trying to resolve a conflict with her\r\nex-husband about the boy's treatment. The father demanded the\r\nstandard medical route; the mother was for natural therapy.\r\nEventually the father won in court, but I had the boy on my program\r\nfor three months before the doctors got their hands on him. Even\r\nduring chemotherapy and radiation the mother kept the boy on my\r\nprogram. Throughout the doctors' treatment he had so few bad side\r\neffects that he was able to continue in school and play with the\r\nother children; he did not lose his hair (which would have made him\r\nfeel like a freak). He recovered. I don't mind that the medical\r\ndoctors took credit, but to my thinking, he recovered despite their\r\ntherapy.\r\n\r\nOnion Cases\r\n\r\nAll too many of my cases are what I privately refer to as onion\r\ncases. By this I mean the opposite of a simple case. There are\r\nmultiple complaints. I call them onion cases because these people\r\nget better in layers, like pealing an onion. As each skin comes off,\r\nthe next becomes visible. Sometimes when the patient overcomes an\r\nexisting complaint, another appears that was not there in the\r\nbeginning, probably this new one is a complaint that they had at an\r\nearlier point in their life, one that had gone away. Onion cases\r\ntake a long time to completely heal, sometimes years. There\r\nfrequently are psychological aspects to the case that surface with\r\ndifferent physical problems. If I were not an effective psychologist\r\nI could not succeed with most of them. The average medical doctor\r\nprobably considers onion cases to be hypochondriacs, but they\r\nusually are not.\r\n\r\nAlmost always the first symptoms that demand attention are the most\r\nlife-threatening, like immune system failures, liver failures,\r\npancreatic failures, nervous system failures and heart failures.\r\nWith these eliminated, new complaints appear. Often these are\r\nendocrine system imbalances or weak endocrine glands, anemias, mild\r\nheart conditions. Then it gets down to eye or ear infections,\r\nmuscular or skeletal weaknesses, mild skin problems, sinusitis,\r\nteeth problems; things that aren't serious but that do degrade the\r\nquality of life. Each one of these layers also carries with it a\r\npsychological component; each of these layers can take three to six\r\nmonths to resolve.\r\n\r\nI had a pretty good idea from the first visit that Daniel, not yet\r\n30, was going to take some time to get well. He already had a\r\ndegenerative condition not usually seen until middle age--crippling\r\ngout and arthritis. He had badly distorted joints, walked with\r\nconsiderable pain, lacked a full range of movement, had enormous\r\nfatigue and consequently, a well-justified depression. Daniel was\r\nabout to give up working as no longer possible, but he liked his\r\njob. And he certainly needed it.\r\n\r\nDaniel's analysis showed massive allergies to foods, a systemic\r\nyeast and multiple virus infections and multiple organ weaknesses: a\r\nlife-threateningly weak immune system, weak pancreas, weak adrenals,\r\nweak large intestine. Because he could hardly accept anything he\r\nwasn't allergic to and because he could not afford to quit working\r\neven for a few weeks (though he was about to be forced into complete\r\ndisability) I put him on a Bieler fast. This is a monodiet of fairly\r\nsubstantial quantities of either well-cooked green beans or\r\nwell-cooked zucchini, the choice between these two foods depending\r\non the acid-base balance of the blood. (Henry Bieler, 1965) In\r\nDaniel's case my choice was zucchini, one pint of plain zucchini\r\npuree with a little kelp and garlic added (no salt, no butter, no\r\nnothing else) every few hours. I also put him on heavy vitamin\r\nsupport and protomorphogens for his desperate immune system. While\r\non the Bieler fast he did daily enemas at home. Had colonics been\r\navailable to him, Daniel couldn't have afforded them.\r\n\r\nWithin three weeks he was far more comfortable, had less pain, more\r\nenergy even though he was still eating nothing but zucchini, had\r\nless swelling in his joints. During the first month he lost about\r\nten pounds and had been skinny to start with. I then added other\r\ncooked nonstarchy vegetables to his diet and we continued the same\r\nprotomorphogen and supplement program for another month.\r\n\r\nOnce each month Daniel came to see me. Each time he had slightly\r\nimproved organ strength and was able to tolerate a few more foods.\r\nBy the third month he stopped losing weight because we added small\r\nquantities of cooked rice and millet to his diet. However, to\r\ncontinue his detox, I had him water fast one day a week, staying in\r\nbed and resting all day. At the start and end of the fasting day he\r\nalso took an enema. He continued a weekly one-day fast for many\r\nmonths. By the fourth month, his immune system testing stronger, a\r\nnew problem appeared. Daniel had intestinal parasites. So I also put\r\nhim on a six month program to eliminate those.\r\n\r\nDaniel required monthly dietary adjustments because he quickly\r\nbecame allergic if he ate very much of anything very often--broccoli\r\nor rice for example. During this time he became aware of many\r\nnegative emotions associated with childhood, of young adult\r\nfrustrations and disappointments. He was really very angry about\r\nmany things in his life, even though he had for many years\r\nmaintained an invariably pleasant social veneer. But now he began\r\nexpressing some of these feelings to me and to his associates.\r\n\r\nDaniel had an abusive girlfriend, but as he improved this\r\nrelationship became insufferable. So he broke off with this woman\r\nand found a new relationship that was much more positive, one based\r\non mutual respect and admiration. There are frequently strong\r\nconnections between repressed anger and depository diseases like\r\narthritis and gout. Daniel could not permit himself to constantly be\r\nmade angry and still get well.\r\n\r\nHis next layer of symptoms did not appear until nearly eighteen\r\nmonths after he had first come to see me. By this time he had good\r\nenergy, had returned to hiking and skiing, camping and canoeing. He\r\nhad worked as a printer but was now bootstrapping his own print shop\r\non a shoestring, and became entirely self-employed. He had a good\r\nromantic relationship. The parasites were gone; his gout and\r\narthritis was virtually gone; many of his food allergies were gone.\r\nNow his body was demanding that its acid/base balance be adjusted\r\nand he began to pay attention to the minor back problems he had all\r\nalong. Daniel had also developed a new problem--inflammation of the\r\neye. It was so severe that he went to an opthamologist seeking\r\nimmediate relief because he could hardly see. I put him on massive\r\ndoses of vitamin C and protomorphogens for the eye and we attacked\r\nthe other problems.\r\n\r\nNow I still see Daniel every three months for minor dietary and\r\nsupplement adjustments. His emotional space is very positive. His\r\nbusiness is doing well. His love life is doing well. He has\r\ndeveloped no new problems and all the old ones are under control.\r\nHis organ systems, though better, will never tolerate many insults,\r\nphysical or mental, but if he lives within his limits, he has every\r\nchance of a long and happy life.\r\n\r\nDaniel has become a friend of mine by now and I like to see him but\r\nI expect I won't see Daniel very much at all any more. He has\r\nlearned what he needs to know to take care of himself. This is a\r\ntypical onion case that resolved successfully. However this case\r\nmight not have worked out so well had Daniel not possessed a high\r\ndegree of personal integrity and bravery, had he not faced and\r\nresolved his emotional conflicts. Fortunately, Daniel had always\r\nconducted an ethical life, without dishonesty or a secret collection\r\nof disreputable acts. Bodies are easy to fix; they are carbon oxygen\r\nengines that work on chemistry and respond unfailingly to physical\r\nmeasures. But the entity that runs the body is not so simple. The\r\nthoughts and emotions of the spirit impinge on a body as powerfully\r\nor more powerfully than all the vitamins, dietary reform or\r\nprotomorphogens I can provide. The mind, and the spirit behind that\r\nmind, can make a body sick or can prevent it from getting well or\r\nstaying well despite everything I do.\r\n\r\nUnethical Illness\r\n\r\nI see a lot of spiritually-induced physical illness in my practice.\r\nMaybe more than my share. Maybe its karmic; it tends to find me\r\nbecause I understand it. And it comes up my driveway because people\r\nwho have it often become doctor shoppers, and seek out a naturopath\r\nas a last resort after exhausting everything that modern medical\r\nscience has to offer. I have had large numbers of undiagnosable\r\npeople that suffer greatly but who medical doctors can find nothing\r\nwrong with and label psychosomatic. I have also repaired people\r\ngiven specific medical diagnoses that standard physical remedies\r\ncannot make better.\r\n\r\nIn most of these cases, the physical illness is secondary to, is an\r\noverlay of a more fundamental spiritual cause. On this type of case\r\nthere are inevitably severe problems connected with close friends,\r\nrelatives and business associates. The sick person inevitably blames\r\nthe friends, relatives and business associates and takes no\r\nresponsibility. The problems seem unresolvable. When I probe deeply\r\nenough into these problems, I begin to discover the real infection\r\nbelow. The sick person, so fond of complaining about all the\r\nterrible things done to them by the people they have or have had\r\nproblems with, or sometimes, so proud of not complaining about all\r\nthe terrible things done to them. Actually, almost inevitably this\r\nperson has committed a huge mass of secret crimes, viciousness and\r\nbetrayals, rarely indictable felonious acts, but crimes none the\r\nless, disreputable deeds that must be kept secret.\r\n\r\nThese deeds are always completely justified; the sick person always\r\nclaims to have been right for having done them and it is next to\r\nimpossible for me as a therapist to get them to take responsibility\r\nfor their sins. But at the deep, center of almost all people is an\r\nhonest, decent soul that knows what it has really done and feels\r\nguilty and judges itself. That is why it says in the Bible, 'judge\r\nnot, lest you be judged'. It is not the judgment of the Deity we\r\nhave so much to fear; we are own worst judge, jury, and executioner,\r\nand eventually extract from ourselves full payment with compound\r\ninterest for all harmful acts.\r\n\r\nPeople frequently punish themselves with severe, incapacitating\r\nillness or even death. A spiritual illness will not respond very\r\nwell to physical treatment until the spiritual malaise's is\r\nresolved. This case has to find enough courage to become honest with\r\nthemselves, to admit their deeds in all their disgusting detail and\r\nthen to make amends, or if amends are not possible, to at least\r\ncease and desist. They have to take personal responsibly for what\r\nthey really are being and what they have really done and most\r\nimportantly, accept that they are responsible for creating their own\r\nillness. It is not a virus, a cancer cell or something that just\r\nfell out of the universe and struck them, innocent victims that they\r\nare. They have made their illness and only they can uncreate it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, few people who have spent a lifetime indulging\r\nthemselves in this degree of irresponsibility have the integrity to\r\nchange. This is a tough case. Especially so because they think they\r\nare physically ill, they did not come to me to be defined as a\r\n\"mental\" case and tend to reject such approaches.\r\n\r\nThere is no shortage of additional degenerative conditions that I\r\ncould describe. There are eating disorders, shingles, skin problems,\r\nkidney disease, Alzheimer's, senility, mental illness, addictions,\r\nchronic fatigue syndrome, aids. There's macular degeneration, carpal\r\ntunnel syndrome, chronic ear infections (especially in children),\r\ntonsillitis, bronchitis, pancreatitis, cystitis, urethritis,\r\nprostatitis, colitis, sinusitis, osteomyelitis and a dozen other\r\nitises, including appendicitis. There's algias (itises of the\r\nnerves): neuralgia, fibromyalgia. There's ism's (really itises of\r\nthe muscles). There are 'onias like pneumonia; omas like carcinoma,\r\nmelanoma and lymphoma.\r\n\r\nI could (but won't) write a page or two on every one of these\r\nconditions and turn this book into an encyclopedia. After twenty\r\nfive years of practice, there is little I have not seen. Or helped a\r\nbody repair. Generally, everyone of those following pages I'm not\r\ngoing to bother to write would repeat the same message. That the\r\nmedical profession has little understanding of the real causes or\r\ncures of disease; that the world is full of unnecessary suffering;\r\nthat there are simple, painless, effective, harmless approaches to\r\neliminating most of the ailments of mankind except the ultimate\r\nailment, old age, the thing that takes us all eventually; that\r\nessentially all the diseases resolve from the same approach.\r\n\r\nBut I have already explained the theoretical basis of natural\r\nhygiene, the key role of toxemia, enervation, constipation, the\r\nessentials of good diet, fasting and colon cleansing, the importance\r\nof regular exercise, and the rational for vitamin supplementation. I\r\nhave revealed a lot of the secrets in my bag of tricks, like my\r\nfavorite herbs, poultices and wheat grass.\r\n\r\nWhat concerns me most about medicine today is that there seems to be\r\never fewer hygienists practicing. The young holistic practitioner is\r\noverwhelmed with confusing data and approaches and is increasingly\r\nless able to discern what is really important and what is\r\ndistraction, and is increasingly intimidated by the AMA, made\r\nfearful of accepting people with serious conditions. Too many young\r\npractitioners become ideologues, clinging to the rightness of a\r\nsingle rigid discipline, missing the truths that exist in other\r\napproaches and worse, missing the limitations that exist in their\r\nown personal healing methods.\r\n\r\nThe current concern about the cost of medical care and resorting to\r\ngovernment-run insurance programs and regulations will do little or\r\nnothing to reverse the trend to more and more sickness that costs\r\nmore and more to treat. The root causes of our current crisis are\r\ntwo fold. One, our food, just as it comes off the farm, is getting\r\never worse. This is not even recognized as a problem. After we\r\nprocess it for an industrial food distribution system, much\r\nnutrition is lost too. This is barely recognized as a problem. Until\r\nwe are better nourished, we will be ever sicker and each generation\r\nwill become a degeneration. Secondly, our society is suffering from\r\nall the evils of monopoly medicine. This is barely recognized. The\r\nAMA has a stranglehold on the sick. There is no effective\r\ncompetition for its methods. Alternatives are suppressed. In my\r\nversion of a better world, if anyone that wanted to could hang out a\r\nshingle and offer to diagnose, treat and cure disease, a few quacks\r\nwould really hurt a few people. But many genuine therapies would\r\nappear and the public would be exposed to workable alternatives. If\r\nanyone that wanted to market it could put a label on a bottle of\r\npills, power or tincture that said its contents would heal or cure\r\ndisease, yes, a few people would be poisoned. And a few would die\r\nneedlessly by failing to get the right treatment. But on the\r\npositive side, all this liberty would result in countless new\r\ntherapies being rediscovered and many new uses for existing\r\nsubstances would appear.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, this is the issue of liberty. I believe it is better\r\nto allow choice and options, to permit the dangers that go with\r\nliberty to exist. And to allow unfortunate outcomes to occur without\r\nintervention into individual lack of intelligence and\r\nirresponsibilities. The opposite is our current path--an attempt to\r\nregulate and control away all dangers. But this overcontrol results\r\nin institutionalized violence and cruelty, inefficiency that is not\r\nchecked or exposed by the bright light of a better way. As Churchill\r\nsaid, 'democracy is the worst form of government there is--except for\r\nall the others.' What he meant is that we must accept that this is\r\nan imperfect world. The best this planet can be is when it is at its\r\nfreest, when restrictions are minimized and when people are allowed\r\nto make their own choices, be responsible for their own outcomes and\r\nexperience the consequences of their own stupidities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPulse Testing For Allergies\r\n\r\nCoca's Pulse Tests are extraordinarily useful and simple tools for\r\nat-home allergy detection. My clients have succeeded at using this\r\napproach without supervision. Coca's test works on this simple\r\nprinciple: pulse elevations are caused by any allergic reaction. If\r\nyou know what your normal range of pulse rates are, you can isolate\r\nan offending food or substance and eliminate it. Success with Coca's\r\nPulse Test requires only motivation and a little perseverance,\r\nbecause in order to test for food allergies, the diet must be\r\nrestricted for a few days and your pulse must be accurately taken at\r\nspecific intervals during the testing period.\r\n\r\nThe test is based on measurement of the resting pulse rate,\r\nsomething most people have no difficulty learning how to do. The\r\nresting rate is how fast the heart beats after a person has been\r\nsitting still, comfortably relaxing for three to five minutes. When\r\na person is active the heart beats faster than the resting rate. One\r\nmeasure of aerobic fitness is how quickly the heart is able to\r\nreturn to its resting rate. Well-trained athletes' hearts can adjust\r\nfrom working very hard to a resting rate in only a minute or so;\r\nthose who are deconditioned can take three to five minutes for their\r\nheart to slow from even mild exertion to its stable, resting pace.\r\nThose who cannot readily find their own pulse on their wrist or\r\nthroat can inexpensively purchase a digital watch that gives a pulse\r\nreading; this kind of watch is used by athletes to make sure their\r\ntraining pulse is in an acceptable range.\r\n\r\nPreparatory to doing Coca's Pulse Test it is necessary to as much as\r\npossible eliminate allergic food reactions. This requires the\r\napplication of discipline for a few days before testing begins.\r\nAllergic reactions can go on for several days after a food has been\r\neaten and if you are having a reaction to something eaten many hours\r\nor several days previously, it may obscure a reaction to a food just\r\neaten.\r\n\r\n1. Stop smoking entirely for at least five days before you do a\r\ncigarette test; allergies to cigarettes can take five days to clear.\r\nBesides, you shouldn't smoke, anyway!\r\n\r\n2. For the first three days, count your resting pulse immediately\r\nafter awakening in the morning (for one entire minute), and record\r\nthe reading.\r\n\r\n3. During the first three days, take your resting pulse half an hour\r\nand again one hour after each meal. It if has elevated more than 12\r\nbeats above the resting rate you found upon arising that morning,\r\nyou may assume that some food at the meal you just ate was an\r\nallergen. Temporarily, eliminate from your diet all the foods eaten\r\nat the previous meal until you can check them one-by-one a few days\r\nlater. At the end of these first three days you may not have many\r\nfoods left that you can eat. That is okay and to be expected; it is\r\ntime to begin adding foods back to the diet.\r\n\r\n4. Most people who are allergic to foods are allergic to one or more\r\nof the following: corn, wheat, milk and cheese, yogurt, meat,\r\nalcohol, tobacco. It would be very wise to eliminate these foods too\r\nfor the first three days, until they are tested.\r\n\r\nAfter three days on this regimen, you can assume that many of your\r\nusual allergic food reactions have ceased or at least diminished\r\nsignificantly and that you probably can get reasonably accurate\r\ntesting results on individual foods. A good indicator of having\r\nproblems with food allergies in general can also show up during\r\nthese initial days. If you have eliminated a large number of foods\r\nand your resting pulse upon awakening has slowed down by several\r\nbeats, you can assume you are allergic to foods you were eating.\r\n\r\nI would not be at all surprised that by the end of the third day you\r\nwere only eating a very few fruits and vegetables and had eliminated\r\neverything else. A more effective variant of the testing procedure\r\ncalls for a three or four day water fast to clear all allergies with\r\nabsolute certainty, and then to introduce foods one at a time as\r\ndescribed below.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth and subsequent few days, take your resting pulse upon\r\narising and then eat a modest quantity of a single food: for\r\nexample, eat a slice of bread, or a medium sized glass of milk, or\r\nan orange, or two tablespoons sugar in dissolved in water, or a few\r\ndried prunes, or a peach, or an egg, or a medium-sized potato, or a\r\ncup of black coffee without sweetener, or a few ounces of meat, or a\r\nstick of celery, or half a cup of raw cabbage, or an onion, or a\r\ndate, or a few hazelnuts, etc. Count the pulse one half hour later\r\nand again one hour after eating the test item.\r\n\r\nIf any food raises the resting pulse over 12 beats per minute above\r\nyour morning resting pulse, that food should be eliminated; you are\r\ncertainly allergic to it or can't digest that much of it. If your\r\npulse has not returned to its morning resting rate one hour later,\r\nyou are still having an allergic reaction to the food you ate\r\npreviously and cannot get a decent result on another food until\r\neither your pulse slows again or until the next morning. You may,\r\nhowever, continue to eat other foods that you know do not provoke\r\nallergic reactions. Because reactions to a food may not clear for\r\nmany hours, it is wise to eat only small quantities of individual\r\nfoods if you wish to test many of them in a single day. If a food\r\ncauses no acceleration of pulse (at least 6 beats above your\r\nestimated normal maximal) that food can be tentatively labeled\r\nnon-allergenic.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days of testing one food an hour, you will become weary\r\nof the routine and wish to eat more normally. It may also occur that\r\nyou cannot test more than one or two foods a day from the very first\r\nday because allergic reactions do not clear quickly enough. No\r\nproblem, the testing period can go on at a lower level of intensity\r\nfor many weeks, trying one new food each morning upon arising. As\r\nyou eliminate allergens from your diet one by one, your resting\r\npulse should drop somewhat and it should be easier to discern\r\nallergic reactions. After you have worked through all the items in\r\nyour normal dietary, it would be wise to retest the foods a second\r\ntime, breaking your fast with one different test item each morning.\r\nThis second testing round may reveal a few more allergic reactions\r\nthat were obscured by other allergic reactions the first time\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nVitamin and Supplement Suppliers\r\n\r\nBronson Pharmaceutical\r\n1945 Craig Road\r\nP.O.
